WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Oh my god.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Smash that bell to get notifications of when we go live.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Smash that bell to get smashed.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
To get smashed?

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Yeah.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Yeah, like with alcohol or something.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Yeah, I am.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Not literally.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I can't help myself.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
She loves smashing.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
No Nigel Thornberry.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
She just says smashing.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Are we here?

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Are we here?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Okay, finally.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
We're here. I'm sorry for the mess.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Yeah, we're here.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm live now. Finally, dead game.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Okay.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
We, a viewer, have done the holistic approach where none of us will mute.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
So, you're just going to hear everything all at once.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, that's how we're all.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
It just as a reminder, all donations,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
more memberships or super chats will be addressed at the end of the stream

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
when it's not an absolute cluster buck of all six of us together.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
But yes, the whole premise of the power washer was I was going to do a gag

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
and be like, oh, Viola isn't doing so well.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
We might go bust.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
We might go and put a bikini on and get clean in.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Well, that idea is out the window now.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
So instead we're playing Gartik phone.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I've never played it personally.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
She be suggested it and I, her word is law.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
So let's just take it away.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm taking over the company.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Shadow CEO.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Okay. Do you guys want to start? You ready?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
We can finally do it.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I know cheating.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
The guy is so chat.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Don't fucking cheat.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Don't fucking do it.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I swear it off.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
How long do I have to do the sentence?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I don't know.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Help me out.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Help me out.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Senpai.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Don't give away until it's over.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
This is our secret.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Senpai.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Senpai.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
This is funny.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Peek comedy.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Peek comedy.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I don't think so actually.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I know what that is.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
So let me change it.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Hello?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Hello?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
What's wrong?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Moshi Moshi.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Moshi Moshi.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Okay.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
We have to draw these now.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
We have to draw these now.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh my god.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Oh my god.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm drawing this with a mouse.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
You broke that.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I can't see.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Don't cheat.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
This is so bad.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh no.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I've never done this before.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Wait.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Can I make my pen smaller or is she?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Oh no.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Why is he getting drunk?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Why am I drunk?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I don't even know what's happening.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Why are you guys screaming?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Oh my god.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Holy fuck.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
How much time is left in my god?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
The top right corner is the indicator.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Not the shading.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I'm an artist.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm such an artist.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Oh yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Wait.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
All you can fucking draw is me.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
You're all done.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
No.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Wait.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I can look up with a mouse.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We need to get a witness pen.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Hold on.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I can't spell.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
What the fuck am I doing?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
What am I doing with that line?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I should whip out my drawing tablet.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It's beautiful.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Better with a mouse.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
No.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
It's better with a mouse if it looks like hot garbage.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It looks great.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Hey.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Hey.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Hey.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Would you?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm done.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm done.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm done.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
What's Tech say?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I can't tell you.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh, where are you going?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
These are your items.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Okay.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm sorry.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm sorry.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
100% Wood.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Wood.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Why not?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, this is the chat logs.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh my god.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
We need to put the chat logs in quick.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Oh my god.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh, good answer.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Chat logs?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Little person.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Why?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
You guys aren't ready for mine?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Let's put a bit of detail.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
We need some wood detail.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Americans always have an eagle.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Okay.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
What the fuck?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Oh shit.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
What's his name?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
There we go.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
There you go.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
What do you think?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Wait, is that an art?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Tilly.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Tilly.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
My gen mates are wild.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh my god.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I don't know what he looks like.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh no.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh god.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Hold on.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Wait, is she decent so far away?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
All right.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I don't know what Thorne Berry looks like.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I had to look it up.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
I'm just guessing.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm just going for it.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Why is?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I'll look like this.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Wait, I don't look like that.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Sugar.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Don't question this.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Don't question this.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Don't question this.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
How do you draw?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
I hate you.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Oh my god.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I can't.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I can't see on you.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I can't see on you.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I don't know.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I don't know how to draw.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I don't know how to draw anymore.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
That's pretty good, right?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I don't know.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I don't know.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Oh my god.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
This is something.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Wait, hold on.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Ginger in it and there you go.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
That's me.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I don't know what.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
This is awful.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm sorry.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
I don't know.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Let's draw some hair.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Oh my god.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Oh my goodness.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Draw his horn.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Don't ask questions so far.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Don't ask questions so far.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
That is very nice.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I don't know.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
My little leaflings are saying I'm a tree.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Wait, wait, no.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Emi's hair is not orange.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Is it?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Emi's ginger.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Oh my god.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Wait, I'm ginger?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You're not.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Really?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Really?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm a strawberry blonde.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Is this the right OG sign?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I had my image.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
What does that even say?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh, meow.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh my god.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Which one of you speaks Spanish?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I'm 100% sure this is an OG sign.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Oh lord.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Atashi?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
What?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh, how am I supposed to draw that?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Did we even have one?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
What do I look like?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Oh wait, I can't even draw the fucking toilet.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
What do I even look like?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
This is terrible, Unmouse.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Wait, pits is not feet.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Pits is armpits.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
We're grabbing onto the ground for dear life.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Right, armpits.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I don't know.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh my god.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Because none of you guys know some English phrases

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
or some joking phrases.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
What I'm hearing is that a lot of you guys are misinterpreting

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
whatever it is that's very funny.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's going all over his back.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
It's not looking good.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
How do you draw an angry mouth?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Oh, there we go.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Pits is feet.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
No, I'm pretty sure it's armpits.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
We need to draw.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Pits is sweat.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
This is amazing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
What does the Walmart logo look like?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Your armpits has become sentience.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Walmart.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm not even going to explain to Mercy.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh wait, don't you toilet stuff like that?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Oh wait.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Hold on.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I don't know.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
It does make it better.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
It makes it worse.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
It makes it worse.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It makes it worse.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I thought pits is like pits.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
This is so fucking funny.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I think that works out.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
There we go.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
The radiation.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I can't wait to see everything.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Radiation.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Oh no, wait, no, we'll get to see everything.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
No, we'll get to see everything.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh my god.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'll do manual.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
There's going to be no voiceover.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
And then we'll be beginning from the end.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
Okay, let's see.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
So I said, I see with Nidals Thornberry's face saying smashing.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Immigrant.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Immigrant.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
What's going on?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
No!

12:23.000 --> 12:27.420
You look awesome!

12:27.420 --> 12:28.860
No!

12:28.860 --> 12:31.260
What's going on?

12:31.260 --> 12:36.040
Is that Aisey누h reputation?

12:36.040 --> 12:39.300
Is that Aisey Galaxyần revolutionary?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.700
It was!

12:40.700 --> 12:42.700
Oh no!

12:42.700 --> 12:48.760
Why does he look all handsome?

12:48.760 --> 12:50.760
Oh boy.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.760
Oh.

12:52.760 --> 12:53.760
You're on there.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.760
She wanted it.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.760
And then there's Chris Hansen.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.760
Oh my gosh.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.760
And I said, she said it's going to kill me with a crash.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.760
You know, date luck.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.760
Oh no.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.760
It's great to deal.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.760
Oh my god.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.760
Oh my god.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.760
Oh my god.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.760
Oh my god.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.760
I love it.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.760
I love it.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.760
It actually worked out.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.760
Why is it trying my best?

13:26.760 --> 13:28.760
Why does it always sound such a fat talk?

13:28.760 --> 13:30.760
There's a pee pee.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.760
Because he loves me and he's big.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.760
They grew up together.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.760
They grew six times that day.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.760
I'm sorry.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.760
Oh my god.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.760
I'm sorry.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.760
Oh my god.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.760
Oh my gosh.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.760
It is feet.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.760
Oh my gosh.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.760
It is feet.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.760
I don't like how her feet is actual teeth.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.760
I know.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.760
I like that.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.760
I like that.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.760
I never wrote stinky peats.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.760
Which is feet.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.760
But like.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.760
And then she drew pits.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.760
I drew myself in an armpit.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.760
Because I thought it was.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.760
So it was feet.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.760
And not armpits.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.760
She's screaming so loud.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.760
Sorry.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.760
The spot is over.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.760
Okay.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.760
I got it from AC.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.760
Very good artist.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.760
I got it from AC.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.760
Don't ask me what this is.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.760
What does that even mean?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.760
When your job is a poo.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.760
So when your poo hits your prostate on the way out.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.760
Oh I thought it was Javi.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.760
Javi's a poo.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.760
I draw this.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.760
You see me sucking?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.760
I mean suckers don't live hot too.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.760
Oh wait.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.760
Is she giving a blow job?

15:06.760 --> 15:08.760
That's what it looks like.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.760
That's what it looks like to me.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.760
Oh my gosh.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.760
I love the drill.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.760
This is so fucking good.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.760
Oh boy.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.760
It's over.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.760
It's over.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.760
Oh my gosh.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.760
Okay.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.760
That's cute.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.760
I love that.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.760
Oh it's not a cat.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.760
It's not a cat.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.760
It's a winky face.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.760
Okay it's a winky face.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.760
I was like what is miawa?

15:50.760 --> 15:52.760
So I was like who is this guy?

15:54.760 --> 15:56.760
We are so good.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.760
This is a cat.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.760
That's good.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.760
That's good.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.760
I love that.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.760
Okay this makes sense.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.760
This makes sense of what on earth we were drawing.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.760
Because I just chucked out

16:16.760 --> 16:18.760
and like that's items on the shelves.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.760
I worked around.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.760
Oh this is a good diaper.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.760
I see understood me.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.760
Oh my god.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.760
I snored in my teeth or my nose.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.760
I snored in my teeth or my nose.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.760
It's painful it hurts.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.760
I can't.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.760
I can't.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.760
I had to do the toilet stall gap.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.760
Because that's all I see about

16:56.760 --> 16:58.760
when I see American memes.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.760
Oh the toilet stall.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.760
The toilet gap is so big.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.760
You can literally look at people's eyes through it.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.760
It went the wrong way.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.760
Oh no.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.760
We have them closed because you know it's a private time

17:10.760 --> 17:12.760
and you're very vulnerable taking a big job.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.760
So yeah it's actually closed everywhere else in the planet.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.760
Oh you're so lucky.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.760
Yeah.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.760
I had people peeking at me in high school

17:20.760 --> 17:22.760
through the stalls and I'm like

17:22.760 --> 17:24.760
me too.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.760
Oh no.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.760
Is there a DC?

17:28.760 --> 17:30.760
Is there a check?

17:30.760 --> 17:32.760
Is there a DC check?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.760
Are you in the lobby?

17:34.760 --> 17:36.760
Do you need to reload the lobby?

17:36.760 --> 17:38.760
It's gonna do it on its own usually.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.760
No I'm gone.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.760
The link should be in the discord.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.760
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.760
They'll see everything.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.760
I see all of our naughty photos

17:48.760 --> 17:50.760
we just send to each other.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.760
It's real.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.760
It's mostly memes.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.760
It's weird.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.760
Any memes?

17:58.760 --> 18:00.760
I mean to be fair we did share

18:00.760 --> 18:02.760
on that page.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.760
We did share some

18:04.760 --> 18:06.760
lucky nudes of ours.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.760
They've seen my titties.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.760
I started roleplaying as the girls

18:10.760 --> 18:12.760
with my nudes so I was like

18:12.760 --> 18:14.760
this is what Evie would do.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.760
This is what Evie would do.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.760
Our discord is so chaotic.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.760
Okay.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.760
Real though.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.760
But also I did snort out

18:24.760 --> 18:26.760
my tea.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.760
It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.760
Oh no.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.760
There's your snort and tea.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.760
This is what you hate to talk about.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.760
It's a stosterone.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.760
It hurts so much.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.760
Yeah.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.760
I'm getting

18:42.760 --> 18:44.760
pain.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.760
I push

18:46.760 --> 18:48.760
my ears.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.760
I'm getting another heart beat

18:50.760 --> 18:52.760
right now every time she talks.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.760
Oh no.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.760
Our nudes are eye-prone nudes.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.760
I'm not a man.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.760
And my face turned out like that.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.760
Oopsie.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.760
How does she talk like this?

19:04.760 --> 19:06.760
I don't know.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.760
Oopsie.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.760
I feel like Azera

19:10.760 --> 19:12.760
can do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.760
Me too.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.760
Jennifer Coolidge.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.760
Did it.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.760
I don't know what Jennifer Coolidge

19:20.760 --> 19:22.760
is impression.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.760
Wait you don't know Jennifer Coolidge.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.760
Jennifer Coolidge.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.760
Oh.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.760
I'm going to switch back to you.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.760
Oh my god.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.760
Oh my god.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.760
Jennifer Coolidge.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.760
Are you kidding me?

19:40.760 --> 19:42.760
Are you kidding me?

19:42.760 --> 19:44.760
Are you kidding me?

19:44.760 --> 19:46.760
Why are we opening our gap for the way

19:46.760 --> 19:48.760
you raise your voice?

19:48.760 --> 19:50.760
Azura.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.760
Azura.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.760
Click that link in the general

19:54.760 --> 19:56.760
discord to bring me out.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.760
Is it not letting you back in?

19:58.760 --> 20:00.760
Are you being funny?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.760
No.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.760
No.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.760
Are you kidding me?

20:06.760 --> 20:08.760
I don't hear you screaming.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.760
Your make cuts out.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.760
Azura.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.760
So it just goes

20:16.760 --> 20:18.760
What's happening?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.760
What's happening?

20:20.760 --> 20:22.760
It's constantly loading.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.760
Did you?

20:24.760 --> 20:26.760
No.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.760
Can we do another?

20:28.760 --> 20:30.760
I'm sorry.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.760
Will you guys see the discord if I open it?

20:32.760 --> 20:34.760
No.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.760
I'm sorry.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.760
I should see anything else.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.760
I would close the winner capture

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
in the OBS just in case.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.760
Yes, you can open it.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.760
Are we restarting a new lobby?

20:46.760 --> 20:48.760
A new lobby?

20:48.760 --> 20:50.760
I think we can still invite to this lobby.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.760
A bit of all.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.760
Why is there two?

20:54.760 --> 20:56.760
Are we going to a different room?

20:56.760 --> 20:58.760
I don't know.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.760
I only see one of you.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
No.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.760
Wait, there's a new one?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.760
No, there's Azura again.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.760
We're good.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.760
We're Gucci.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.760
Okay, which one should we play?

21:12.760 --> 21:14.760
Normal.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.760
Knock off.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.760
Keep yourself focused.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.760
Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.760
Create animations in a collaborative way.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.760
Icebreaker.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.760
Play with a sentence.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.760
Exquisite co-ops.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.760
This character is connected by the top of the drawings.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.760
I don't know what that means.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.760
Hold on.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.760
Complement.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.760
Complete the sketch.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.760
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.760
Masterpiece.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.760
Create a piece of art.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.760
Play in a single term with no time limit.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.760
I feel like story would be funny.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.760
Write a narrative using only the previous sentence.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.760
Yes, okay.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.760
You want to do story?

21:54.760 --> 21:56.760
Yeah, let's try story.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.760
Start writing.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.760
Start.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.760
Oh.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.760
Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.760
Just a sentence.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.760
Okay, okay.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.760
Do you like write the whole story or no?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.760
No, you have really limited characters.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.760
I don't know it.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.760
No.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.760
What did you do?

22:26.760 --> 22:28.760
There's time.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.760
There's time.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.760
15 seconds, love.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.760
Oh, my God.

22:34.760 --> 22:36.760
I wanted to write more.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.760
You can only write one sentence.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.760
Okay.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.760
Done.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.760
The end.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.760
There's it.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.760
Oh.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.760
Oh.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.760
We are not beating the caca allegations.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.760
Oh, my God.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.760
What the fuck is happening?

23:04.760 --> 23:06.760
Oh, they're going to know this is me spelling it

23:06.760 --> 23:08.760
because I didn't use a Z on that.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.760
I'm just going to leave it like that.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.760
Yep, I'm sending it.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.760
I'm not even spell checking.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.760
Fuck it.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.760
Fuck it.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.760
Fuck it.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.760
I'm bad at stories.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.760
What the fuck?

23:36.760 --> 23:38.760
So they...

23:38.760 --> 23:40.760
Oh.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.760
Oh, the sentence is so small.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.760
Like, I want to give a bit more.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.760
Me, too.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.760
Wait.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.760
I think it gets shorter over time.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.760
I'm going to be like,

23:56.760 --> 23:58.760
I'm going to be like,

24:04.760 --> 24:06.760
I'm going to write until, fuck.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.760
What?

24:10.760 --> 24:12.760
What's that?

24:12.760 --> 24:14.760
Okay.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.760
Wow.

24:16.760 --> 24:18.760
Let's see.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.760
Oh, no.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.760
Fuck.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.760
I'm not a spell neighboring.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.760
Oh, fuck.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.760
Her name.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.760
It's funny because...

24:32.760 --> 24:34.760
Yes.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.760
Nobody's the snippet.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.760
The pen pals.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.760
The bleeding hearts and the harem

24:40.760 --> 24:42.760
all get to see this unfold.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.760
And we're all just vaping like...

24:44.760 --> 24:46.760
Oh.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.760
Fuck it.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.760
Oh, you...

24:50.760 --> 24:52.760
Wait, is that the fucking...

24:52.760 --> 24:54.760
Soft and warm.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.760
Fancy little bowl of fur.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.760
Happy kitty.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.760
Sleepy kitty.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.760
You watch fucking

25:02.760 --> 25:04.760
big bang

25:04.760 --> 25:06.760
steering.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.760
Wait, that's a nice spell.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.760
I need more letters.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.760
I am...

25:22.760 --> 25:24.760
Amazing.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.760
Amazing.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.760
I'm an amazing writer.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.760
That sounds like she me.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.760
No.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.760
I don't know this lyrics.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.760
This...

25:46.760 --> 25:48.760
This agency...

25:48.760 --> 25:50.760
We can just...

25:50.760 --> 25:52.760
This agency...

25:54.760 --> 25:56.760
I hate this.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.760
They don't give you enough to write.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.760
It's like...

26:00.760 --> 26:02.760
Fuck off.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.760
Okay.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.760
Here's how terrible this is going to be.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.760
I'll do the auto.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.760
This is terrible.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.760
How about everybody reads their own story?

26:14.760 --> 26:16.760
Yeah, of course.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.760
Okay.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.760
In a galaxy far, far away

26:20.760 --> 26:22.760
there was a goat with big titties.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.760
She had so much milkers

26:24.760 --> 26:26.760
and started raining milk.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.760
Milk.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.760
Azara then went on to make

26:30.760 --> 26:32.760
an empire be milk daily.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.760
It was so successful

26:34.760 --> 26:36.760
the neighboring kingdoms became jealous.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.760
They also wanted some of the juice.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.760
Ew, cooties are not good.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.760
You're not good.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.760
Oh, boy.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.760
Okay, long time ago

26:54.760 --> 26:56.760
there was a polar bear princess

26:56.760 --> 26:58.760
who was trying to fit into...

27:02.760 --> 27:04.760
They're a little bit stronger

27:04.760 --> 27:06.760
than any foreign addiction.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.760
They couldn't touch it.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.760
No, that was from Drake.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.760
I didn't know how to finish it.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.760
I was like...

27:22.760 --> 27:24.760
Ding ding.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.760
That was supposed to be the song like ding ding.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.760
Ding ding.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.760
Ding ding.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.760
I was so hard.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.760
I'm crying.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.760
I'm crying.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.760
I'm crying.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.760
I'm crying.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.760
There was a beach of agency

27:42.760 --> 27:44.760
that was lived.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.760
They all came in

27:46.760 --> 27:48.760
and the children were just that bad.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.760
So they danced, the pee-pee dance

27:50.760 --> 27:52.760
and told the kids.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.760
And then finally,

27:54.760 --> 27:56.760
they peed everywhere on the

27:56.760 --> 27:58.760
floor, the walls, the bed,

27:58.760 --> 28:00.760
the kite.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.760
We're all filled with piss everywhere

28:04.760 --> 28:06.760
but he loved it.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.760
The fact that he was in a piss prompt

28:08.760 --> 28:10.760
before AC came out with that

28:10.760 --> 28:12.760
literally wasn't used.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.760
AC didn't have one.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.760
AC didn't have one.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.760
Third.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.760
Seventh character added.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.760
This is so good.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.760
Okay.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.760
Once upon a time, there were whores.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.760
They were the elitists of whores.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.760
Wild West.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.760
All these really cute cowgirls.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.760
Pussycat.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.760
So cute.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.760
So messy.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.760
Big bang theory. More like bang bang.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.760
Your mom left.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.760
Keep my mom out of your head now.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.760
I'm sorry.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.760
Ten.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.760
Ten.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.760
Once upon a time, there was a big bump.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.760
Oh, no.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.760
Oh, no.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.760
Oh, no.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.760
Oh, no.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.760
Oh, no.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.760
Oh, no.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.760
Oh, no.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.760
Oh, no.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.760
Oh, no.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.760
Oh, no.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.760
Oh, no.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.760
Oh, no.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.760
They all took mine.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.760
She was trying to grab it.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.760
She was trying to grab mine.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.760
Seriously.

29:26.760 --> 29:30.760
My gosh.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.760
She was trying to grab mine.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.760
She was trying to grab mine.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.760
She was trying to grab mine.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.760
You can't stop thinking

29:38.760 --> 29:40.760
What's the fun?

29:40.760 --> 29:42.760
You guys know why I rate the scripts

29:42.760 --> 29:52.760
Why do we keep talking about shit all of that?

29:52.760 --> 29:58.760
She became so bad, I hate this.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.760
Fuck no.

30:00.760 --> 30:04.760
No, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.760
Azura, do you have a mic filter on?

30:06.760 --> 30:08.760
I can never hear you.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.760
Turn that mic.

30:10.760 --> 30:12.760
Get that steel-

30:12.760 --> 30:14.760
See that steel-series.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.760
No, it's not.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.760
Don't have a filter on.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.760
There's no filter on?

30:20.760 --> 30:22.760
No, there's no filter on.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.760
Your steel-series filter.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.760
I don't have a filter.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.760
I don't have one on.

30:28.760 --> 30:32.760
What is happening?

30:32.760 --> 30:36.760
Can't wait for the void if we survive.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.760
That'll be fine.

30:38.760 --> 30:42.760
Why don't we try another one?

30:42.760 --> 30:44.760
Another, another, another.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.760
Please, please, no more shit.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.760
No more shit in his.

30:50.760 --> 30:54.760
No promises.

30:54.760 --> 30:58.760
I'll try my best.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.760
Can we do a compliment?

31:00.760 --> 31:04.760
My stomach hurts.

31:04.760 --> 31:06.760
All the actions are a mystery.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.760
You can't hear Mercy, Mercy test?

31:08.760 --> 31:10.760
Sorry, sorry.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.760
I was muting because I was coughing

31:12.760 --> 31:14.760
because I was laughing.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.760
My side hurts so badly.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.760
Okay, Mercy test complete.

31:18.760 --> 31:24.760
Do you want to do a compliment?

31:24.760 --> 31:28.760
We draw on each other's drawings, basically.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.760
Oh, we should try that.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.760
I think that would be fun.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.760
I can't wait to draw some of this.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.760
Some basic lines, okay.

31:38.760 --> 31:42.760
So sketch some basic lines, okay.

31:42.760 --> 31:46.760
Let me do this.

31:46.760 --> 31:50.760
Maybe I could just, maybe I would do like some basic lines.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.760
Like woo.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.760
Okay, boom.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.760
Boom.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.760
Yeah.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.760
I'm just gonna draw a bunch of dicks.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.760
I just leave that.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.760
To castle.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.760
No.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.760
Are you joking?

32:08.760 --> 32:12.760
These are blockers.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.760
You know exactly what you did.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.760
And no, I don't have the strength to resist.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.760
What?

32:18.760 --> 32:20.760
Wait, wait, wait.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.760
I got it, I can make this.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.760
I can salvage this.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.760
This is the back legs of it.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.760
Uh-huh.

32:28.760 --> 32:32.760
This is huge milkers.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.760
And then this, this is legs.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.760
There you go.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.760
Only a few more lines.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.760
Uh-huh.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.760
Yeah, you're so dark.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.760
You're so creepy.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.760
Honestly.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.760
I'll get the girl to tell you off if you don't behave.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.760
That's shocking.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.760
You guys don't have innocent eyes anymore.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.760
Why?

32:54.760 --> 32:56.760
Cute.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.760

42:40.880 --> 42:42.880
and I'm not even going to pretend otherwise

42:42.880 --> 42:44.880
it was definitely Azura that drew the ball sack

42:44.880 --> 42:46.880
100%

42:46.880 --> 42:48.880
why do I feel like this is a lie

42:50.880 --> 42:52.880

42:52.880 --> 42:54.880
I'm really drawing over it right now

42:54.880 --> 42:56.880
if you guys didn't know

42:56.880 --> 42:58.880
Azura's ears actually have

42:58.880 --> 43:00.880
gold jewelry on the end of them

43:00.880 --> 43:02.880
this is nice

43:02.880 --> 43:04.880
she's pimped out with jewelry

43:04.880 --> 43:06.880
but it's like not a vanity

43:06.880 --> 43:08.880
there you go

43:08.880 --> 43:10.880
it's like gifts

58:02.880 --> 58:04.880
I tried my best

58:04.880 --> 58:06.880
literally I have

58:06.880 --> 58:08.880
literally

58:08.880 --> 58:10.880
oh someone rated the vtuber

58:10.880 --> 58:12.880
they were like the only thing that would have been

58:12.880 --> 58:14.880
it better as if

58:14.880 --> 58:16.880
you let them design their models

58:16.880 --> 58:18.880
from the start I'm like bruv

58:18.880 --> 58:20.880
it took me a fucking year to get here

58:20.880 --> 58:22.880
oh my god

58:22.880 --> 58:24.880
it takes forever to

58:24.880 --> 58:26.880
it is not like an overnight thing

58:26.880 --> 58:28.880
draw and rank a vtuber model

58:28.880 --> 58:30.880
honestly who am I missing

58:30.880 --> 58:32.880
she knows how to do it

58:32.880 --> 58:34.880
the lot of work

58:34.880 --> 58:36.880
oh my god

58:40.880 --> 58:42.880
there's only a select few corpos that will let you do that

58:42.880 --> 58:44.880
literally it takes a little long

58:44.880 --> 58:46.880
oh shit

58:46.880 --> 58:48.880
man this is rough

58:48.880 --> 58:50.880
usually ones that have like artists in house as well

58:50.880 --> 58:52.880
yeah we don't

58:52.880 --> 58:54.880
we just put in the coin part

58:54.880 --> 58:56.880
most companies

58:56.880 --> 58:58.880
if not all of them

58:58.880 --> 59:00.880
say for you

59:00.880 --> 59:02.880
will have

59:02.880 --> 59:04.880
pre-made

59:04.880 --> 59:06.880
pre-made

59:06.880 --> 59:08.880
so it's not actually standard

59:08.880 --> 59:10.880
for people to choose

59:10.880 --> 59:12.880
it's really not

59:12.880 --> 59:14.880
that's why it's usually like

59:14.880 --> 59:16.880
cast for the roles

59:16.880 --> 59:18.880
you have to fit the characters

59:18.880 --> 59:20.880
everything for

59:28.880 --> 59:30.880
no

59:32.880 --> 59:34.880
there

59:34.880 --> 59:36.880
what the fuck

59:36.880 --> 59:38.880
is that

59:40.880 --> 59:42.880
it looks like an abomination

59:42.880 --> 59:44.880
oh

59:44.880 --> 59:46.880
memorize it and replicate it

59:46.880 --> 59:48.880
this is easy

59:48.880 --> 59:50.880
what is this

59:54.880 --> 59:56.880
look how cute this is

59:56.880 --> 59:58.880
okay

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880
now we have to draw it

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.880
are we ready

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.880
just draw it your way

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.880
and that's the fun part

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.880
I've already forgot which position everyone was in

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.880
wrong

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.880
this is so bad

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.880
sorry reflinx honestly I would talk more

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.880
but this takes so much brain power

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.880
to do this

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.880
I'm so brain dead

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.880
like I'm

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.880
I'm reading chat

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.880
I'm reading everything but I'm not

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.880
responding I'm so sorry

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.880
I can see everyone

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.880
saying

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.880
I'm just really in this

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.880
I can't remember

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.880
who was where

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.880
I'm just fucking losing it

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.880
I think

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.880
oh boy

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.880
I forgot there was a shorter time

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.880
what the fuck

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.880
that's far too short

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880
this is why it's chaotic

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.880
why was the other one longer

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.880
I don't remember what

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.880
I didn't want to do that

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.880
oh

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.880
okay okay okay

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.880
okay

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.880
oh shit there's like no time

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.880
we draw this as fast

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.880
as we can

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.880
oh fuck

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.880
oh

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.880
no no no

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.880
not like this

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.880
I can't remember what it looked like

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880
is there supposed to be someone

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.880
in a pirate boat by the way

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.880
cause I don't think I saw it

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.880
is there supposed to be a person in it

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.880
I don't know

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.880
the timer is supposed

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.880
to go really fast

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.880
so it's

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.880
oh my god

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.880
okay that's easy enough

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.880
that's easy enough

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.880
oh it's already half

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.880
okay

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.880
gotta go fast

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.880
gotta go fast

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.880
faster faster oh fuck

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.880
I am so sorry

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.880
oh

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.880

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.880

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.880
okay okay okay we can do this

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.880

don't panic don't panic

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.880
the greatest part is that

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.880
we are all panicking

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.880
oh no no no

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.880

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.880
okay this is easy

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.880
this has to be

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.880
this has to be men's

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.880
easy

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.880
was it blue I can't remember it was blue

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.880
let's fucking go

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.880
let's fucking go

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.880
this looks like shade but oh wow

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.880
I mean

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.880
that was rough

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880
oh my god

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.880
that was rough

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.880
that was rough

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.880
that was easy really

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.880
oh my god

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.880
that's amazing

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.880
I love it

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.880
oh

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.880
oh

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880
oh

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.880
you have all the time

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.880
why didn't you give me time

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.880
I did not have

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.880
any time for this

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.880
I was like

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.880
at least

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.880
at least it stayed a cat

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.880
at least it stayed a cat

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.880
that little campfire with all of us together

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.880
that's so fucking cute

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.880
that's what I hate most

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.880
we don't have time

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.880
we don't have time

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.880
we're doing a slack of face

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.880
we're doing a slack of face

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.880
oh we're all here in room 5

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:18.960
Okay, this is good this stage

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:52.080
oh she's not in jail she's at the

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.320
king

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.320
Okay, that looks like it.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.320
Oh my God.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.320
Oh, no.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.320
Oh, no.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.320
Oh, no.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.320
She broke her tail by the end.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320
She broke it.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.320
He's freeing it.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.320
Wow.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.320
Oh, so close.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.320
One piece.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.320
I was like, why the...

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.320
I was like, what was the thing in the bowl?

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.320
I was like...

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.320
I was like, stop.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.320
Oh, no.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.320
She's getting ugly.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.320
She's getting all the water.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.320
Oh, my God.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.320
Oh, my God.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.320
Oh, my God.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.320
Oh, my God.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.320
It looks like a floating fish.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.320
Oh.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320
Oh, my God.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.320
She's shooting her piss.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.320
She's shooting her piss?

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.320
Wait, that's supposed to be me.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.320
What?

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.320
You're giving her rest.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.320
Oh, my goodness.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320
It needs to survive.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.320
Before we bite him.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.320
Oh.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.320
The piss is gone.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.320
Oh, my God.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.320
Oh, my God.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.320
Oh, my God.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.320
Oh, that was so good.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.320
That was so good, right?

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.320
One more.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.320
One more.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.320
One more.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.320
One more.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.320
One more.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.320
One more.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.320
One more.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.320
What have we not done?

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.320
I don't know.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.320
I don't remember.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.320
All the actions are mystery.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320
Drawing and sentences are hitting during the game.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.320
What's the secret?

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.320
The secret seems rough.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.320
I've never done that one before.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.320
Okay.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.320
We'll try it.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320
Last round, boys.

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.320
Last round.

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.320
Okay, okay, okay.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.320
Oh, shoot.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.320
What?

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.320
Oh, it's a secret.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.320
How else does it know what I'm writing?

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.320
Wait, what?

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.320
Huh?

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.320
Yeah!

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.320
It's a secret to everyone.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.320
Oh, bro.

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.320
I can't erase my things.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.320
I don't know.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.320
What is this?

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.320
Um...

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.320
Why is this?

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.320
Oh!

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.320
The lines disappear too!

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.320
It just appears.

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.320
Oh, we can't see what we're drawing?

01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.320
What?

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.320
Okay, I'll draw fast.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.320
What the fuck?

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.320
Okay.

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.320
I don't know. I think...

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.320
I'm going to just guess...

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.320
what it is.

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.320
Where it is?

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.320
That's so funny.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.320
Oh, god.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.320
What the fuck?

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.320
Oh, no, no.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.320
I'm going to try to draw.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.320
Why is it so hard?

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.320
Do-do-do.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.320
Do-do-do-do.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.320
Do-do-do-do-do.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.320
Um...

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.320
These are the past ones.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.320
Can I...

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.320
Can I go backwards?

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.320
Does it work like that?

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.320
I didn't give you his legs.

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.320
Oh, sugar.

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.320
Yeah!

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.320
Um...

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.320
I hope Ace is somewhere there.

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.320
This is gonna...

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.320
I don't even know what I drew.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.320
No idea.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320
I can't tell what those are.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.320
What is that?

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.320
Okay.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.320
Okay.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.320
Okay.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.320
I spelled that all wrong.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.320
No, I didn't get it.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.320
What the fuck?

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.320
Uh...

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.320
What?

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.320
What does that even mean?

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320
Um, shit.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.320
That is not even me.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.320
I'm sorry.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.320
Okay.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.320
Okay.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.320
Fuck.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.320
I don't know what else to draw.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.320
That's exactly what I drew, I think.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.320
Is this a vine reference?

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.320
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.320
Locked in.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.320
I locked in.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.320
Did I give...

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.320
Wait, did I give them bodies?

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.320
I don't think I gave them bodies.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.320
I don't even know where they are.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.320
I don't know.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.320
There's a shot in the dark.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.320
Mercy, you know what that is gonna be interpreted as.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.320
And will I stop the creative flow?

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.320
Oh my god.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.320
Do you stop the creative flow?

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.320
Oh my god.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.320
Amy's got a hoodie here.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.320
Oh, sugar.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.320
I put juice on her.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.320
This is hard.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.320
I didn't even know what the fuck I'm doing anymore.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.320
I'm fucking dying.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.320
What is this?

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.320
What is this?

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.320
What is this?

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.320
What is happening?

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.320
Someone had a stroke.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.320
Could you ever do this one?

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.320
Hope you're feeling okay.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.320
Make sure you hydrate.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.320
Fuck, I didn't have enough time to write it.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.320
Oh man.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.320
How do I even draw this?

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320
This is...

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320
Mm-hmm.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.320
Mm-hmm.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.320
That's the tongue.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.320
And then this is...

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320
literally everyone.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.320
Wait.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.320
I don't know.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.320
Okay, then what...

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.320
I don't know where the body is.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.320
What am I drawing?

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.320
Oh.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320
I...

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.320
Motion swipes as well.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.320
And a little arrow to indicate which...

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.320
Yeah.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.320
Yeah, there we go.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.320
I think I drew it correctly.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.320
A little bit of lipstick.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.320
Ah, where is it?

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.320
Cute? I don't know.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.320
I just drew anything.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.320
I don't know.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.320
Oh, she's sad.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.320
No, my hair.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.320
I can't wait to see the end of this.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.320
This is going to be...

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.320
This is a great...

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.320
This is going to be fucking insane.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.320
What's going on in the ceiling?

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.320
Oh, I need to draw on the ceiling quick.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.320
There we go.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.320
Oh, I'm so scared of what these look like.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.320
Me too.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.320
Me too.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.320
I can't read.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.320
It's the end of the TikTok.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.320
Oh, my God.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.320
Oh, my God.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.320
I think she's beautiful.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.320
I was like...

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.320
Oh, you're not okay.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.320
I completely missed the body.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.320
Oh, my God.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.320
Don't talk to my face.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.320
Don't talk to my face.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.320
Don't talk to my face.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.320
I was going to...

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.320
I was going to write even being cute.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.320
She was on a stick.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.320
I'm so dating.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.320
I'm so sad.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.320
I'm so sorry.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.320
Oh, that's why you were home in Indiana Jones.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.320
I was like, where did that come from?

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.320
I was trying to write Cowboy,

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.320
but I didn't.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.320
Oh, that's so adorable.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.320
I got so mad.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.320
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.320
You're talking to me.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.320
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.320
Wait, why is he crying?

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.320
Your eye is gone.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.320
It's gone white.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.320
It's gone purple.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.320
I love colors.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.320
It really was cooked.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.320
I love colors.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.320
I used the color black

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.320
and I used red as well

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.320
and orange.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.320
What is going on with him?

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.320
That's so rude.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.320
He's loving.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.320
He's loving.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.320
He's so dead.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.320
I can't breathe.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.320
This was beautiful.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.320
Hey.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.320
I like this girl.

01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.320
Oh.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.320
He's like,

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.320
what is going on?

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.320
I don't know.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.320
I don't know.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.320
You're so fucking eraser.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.320
That's why you're so cute.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.320
You're so cute.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.320
You're so cute.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.320
How did we get back to boobs?

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.320
I don't know how you ran into that.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.320
Obviously.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.320
Well, actually, that potato was really bad.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.320
Never mind.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.320
Aw.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.320
Awesome.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.320
You'll learn number one.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.320
Wait, I don't know.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.320
You'll learn number three.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.320
You're so cute.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.320
You're so cute.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.320
I'm so sorry.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.320
I'm so sorry.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.320
I'm so sorry.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.320
I'm sorry.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.320
I'm so sorry.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.320
Stop.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.320
Oh no.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.320
Look at his soul.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.320
What's happening in the middle of the world?

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.320
Oh my god.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.320
Oh my god.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.320
The book got you this.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.320
Oh, they drew us?

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.320
Yes.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.320
Your mom called me.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.320
No!

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.320
No!

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.320
No!

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.320
No!

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.320
No!

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.320
Oh no!

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.320
What are you doing?

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.320
Oh no!

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.320
Oh my god!

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.320
What keeps her from smiling?

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.320
Same.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.320
My jaw hurt.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.320
Okay, okay.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.320
Oh no!

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.320
Okay!

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.320
Oh my god!

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.320
Oh my god!

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.320
Oh my god!

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.320
Oh my god!

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.320
Can somebody download that one?

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.320
Oh my god!

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.320
Oh my god!

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.320
That's so amazing!

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.320
That's so fucking funny!

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.320
I love it!

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.320
That's so fucking funny!

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.320
That's so fucking funny!

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.320
That's so fucking funny!

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.320
I love it!

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.320
They got the premium pass!

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.320
They got the premium pass!

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.320
You see at the convention.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.320
They got the premium pass.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.320
That's funny!

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.320
I'm tying Amy to the tracks.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.320
Oh my god!

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.320
Holy shit!

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.320
I'm not going to endure the girls to anything more.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.320
Because our faces are ready to fall off after that.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.320
Is anyone doing a stream?

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.320
Is anyone doing a stream?

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.320
Is anyone putting?

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.320
Are you doing a stream right away, Isnora?

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.320
Because I'll do something.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.320
I need to appear really bad.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.320
I'm going to jump out of the call.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.320
Of course, you need to pee.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.320
I'm going to jump out of the call.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.320
I'm asking my new piss out!

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.320
I know!

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.320
I'm going to jump out of the call

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.320
and do a little zart so then I'll redirect into you, Isnora.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.320
I'm going to jump out of the call and do a little zart so then I'll redirect into you, Isnora.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.320
Okay?

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.320
I'm going to be on start though.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.320
Okay, right.

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.320
I might play, do you guys want me to?

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.320
I might play some Call of the Lamb.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.320
If someone does a pop-up stream just tell me.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.320
I'll talk to my refunds for a bit.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.320
Thank you so so much all members and dolls

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.320
for this hilarity that ensued

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:41.320
after such a miserable start.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.320
That's amazing.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.320
Such a miserable start to power water.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.320
I always shat myself from laughing so hard.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.320
Oh my god.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.320
We already know AC's panties are soaked.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.320
So let's not...

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.320
Am I probably?

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.320
No!

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.320
No.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.320
Alright, let me sniff.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.320
Let me sniff test.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.320
No! Don't do the sniff test!

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.320
Rather pungent my dear.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.320
You have to take a test.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.320
Taste instead.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.320
She just disintegrated.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.320
Oh my god.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.320
Great.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.320
I'm going to jump out of chat.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.320
Thank you so much.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.320
I'll see you guys next week with each other.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.320
So look out for that.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.320
I'll jump out of chat.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.320
Thank you so much my darlings, my daughters, my girls.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.320
I'll talk to you very shortly.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.320
I'm off to the refunds.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.320
I love you my daughters.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.320
These are the Villalor girls.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.320
Yeah.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.320
They're so cute, right?

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.320
Oh my god.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.320
That was really something.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.320
Okay, wait.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.320
Are you guys still streaming?

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.320
Yeah.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.320
I am.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320
I don't know what to do.

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.320
I guess I got to go off.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.320
Okay, let's go off.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.320
Go to just chatting and then raid into Azra.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.320
I think Azra's next, right?

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.320
Yeah.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.320
Me and Azra are going to be streaming.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.320
She's doing Stardew.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.320
I'm doing Call of the Limb.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.320
Wait, wait.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.320
So Shibi and Azra are going to stream right now?

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.320
Yeah, I'm going to keep streaming.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.320
No.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.320
I'm probably going to end this one

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.320
so that the bot is separated.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.320
Oh, yeah.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.320
I ended it to make a new one.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.320
Okay.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.320
I'll hang up and then I'll go to the

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.320
just chatting and then I'll send.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.320
I'll check if y'all ready.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.320
Okay.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.320
Bye-bye.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.320
Okay.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.320
Bye-bye.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.320
Okay.

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.320
I don't know why my chat isn't working.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.320
I've double triple-checked it.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.320
I'm so sorry.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.320
My darling.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.320
Snippets.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.320
My senpai.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320
That we were going to play,

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320
as you know, we were going to play

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.320
Power Wash Simulator

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.320
except

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.320
isn't, because you had to redo the room.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.320
You're probably right.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.320
You're probably right.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.320
Yeah, you're probably right.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.320
And what happened with

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.320
Power Wash Simulator

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.320
is that every time

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.320
it got past four people

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.320
it just disconnected

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.320
and would not connect

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.320
everyone in, even though we were in a room

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.320
for six players.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.320
And then that was

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.320
and then we couldn't

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.320
we tried. We tried over and over

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.320
and over and over again and we're like

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.320
stop, stop moving, stop moving.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.320
Maybe they'll come in if we stop moving

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320
and it didn't work. And so instead

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.320
we

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.320
we ended up having

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.320
to pick something

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.320
really fast. So we went through

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.320
a list of games. We're like

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.320
do you have this? No. Do you have this? No.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.320
Do you have this? No. Oh shit.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.320
How about we do Jackbox? Oh shit. How do you stream

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.320
Jackbox? We don't know how to stream Jackbox.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.320
All of us can't stream

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.320
Jackbox. What do we have instead? Oh,

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.320
we have Gartik Phone. That's free.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.320
And so we stayed

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.320
with Gartik Phone instead.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.320
So I apologize

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.320
for the fact that we did not do

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.320
PowerWash Simulator

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.320
because it was like

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.320
if I knew everyone was going to go

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320
like balls to the walls

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.320
like

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.320
yeah, I wouldn't have

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.320
tried to save the stream.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.320
I didn't have to try to save it

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.320
but I ended up

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.320
as far as a train

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.320
wreck. It's far from the moon.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.320
This ball is going to go away.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.320
Probably.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.320
I'll see if it stays up but it might go away.

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.320
I never stood a chance.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.320
I never stood a chance. I was like

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.320
oh man.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.320
It's okay. Can you

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.320
see how

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.320
how like

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.320
gosh, we're so friendly with each

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.320
other. It's so funny.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.320
It's so funny.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.320
I'm sorry. Also earlier

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.320
when you heard like the weird sounds, I'm so

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.320
sorry. I literally laughed so hard.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.320
I

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.320
the my T went out my nose.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.320
Everyone's so cute together. I know

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.320
they're so cute, right?

01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.320
I love them so much.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.320
I love them so much.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.320
Honestly, we

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.320
we're very

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.320
we're very

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.320
off the walls with each other.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320
We're off the walls to each other.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.320
My stomach hurts

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.320
so badly.

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.320
The side of my ears

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.320
are hurting from my headphones

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.320
from laughing so hard.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.320
Very wholesome.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.320
I missed the

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.320
tear of the day. I think it's green tea.

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.320
I think it's just a regular green tea.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.320
It really

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.320
unfortunately

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.320
my arm

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.320
is still really, really, really bad.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.320
It's less bad than before, but now

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.320
it's all like bumpy and gross.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.320
So

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.320
I'm gonna go rest again in order

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.320
for it to calm down. I sent

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.320
pictures to the girls and they were like,

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.320
oh geez, are you gonna be okay for

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.320
today's stream? And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it'll be fine.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.320
Someone said you were snorting matcha. I mean, like

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.320
it's probably green tea. So yeah,

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.320
what is green tea? It's matcha.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.320
Was an allergic reaction? I think it's an

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.320
allergic reaction.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.320
I think it's an allergic

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.320
reaction.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.320
But it's like, I felt it last night.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.320
It crawled.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.320
Like the rash went all the way to my back

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.320
and I was like,

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.320
what's going on?

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.320
So I changed shirts and everything. I changed

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.320
shirts.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.320
I changed shirts.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.320
I'm gonna see if by

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.320
Saturday,

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.320
if by Saturday, if it doesn't go away,

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.320
I'm gonna go to the doctor because

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.320
it is like

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.320
more than half

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.320
down now. It's like,

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.320
it's no long, it's still red

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.320
ish. It's pink. It's more pink than red

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.320
and less bumpy.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320
So it should

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.320
be fine.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.320
It should be fine. I'm looking at my arm right now.

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.320
You should invest in EpiPen for sure though.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.320
I was gonna drink

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.320
some Benadryl, but Benadryl makes me really

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.320
sleepy and I didn't want to take it before

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.320
the stream.

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.320
It's improving.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.320
I put some Vaseline on it

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.320
to soothe it, to soothe it.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.320
Have you tried taking

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320
Benadryl while showering?

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.320
Is that supposed to be like some kind of

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.320
innuendo thing?

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.320
Are you gonna take it now? Yeah, after stream,

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.320
right now.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.320
I know that Benadryl

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.320
is supposed to be

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.320
what do you call it?

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.320
It's supposed to make people sleepy and in Japan

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.320
it's marketed as a sleeping

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.320
aid, but

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.320
a lot of my friends

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.320
don't feel the sleepy effect from it.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.320
They're like, oh.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.320
They're like, oh, it's

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.320
it makes me actually quite awake

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.320
and I was like, damn, now

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.320
it makes me sleepy. So I'm gonna drink

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320
some, I'm gonna take some

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320
and then we're gonna see if this rash goes down

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.320
so we can

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.320
maybe have a good time.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320
Tomorrow, I believe, is Harvester.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.320
Let's go over my schedule again.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.320
Where's my schedule?

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.320
There it is.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.320
Tomorrow is

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.320
Harvester

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.320
part two.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.320
So we'll have a lot of

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.320
fun with that.

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.320
Um

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.320
and then

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.320
after after that Saturday

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.320
is my day off and then Sunday

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.320
we're back at it with an unarchived

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.320
karaoke stream.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.320
So we'll be singing

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.320
some songs.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.320
We'll be

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.320
humming some haas.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.320
Yeah, so

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.320
that's it.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.320
Remember, this is

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.320
since I woke up early for the club

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.320
Harvester

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.320
and the unarchived

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.320
karaoke stream will be at

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.320
my regular times at 11pm

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.320
EDT.

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.320
So we're gonna

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.320
we're gonna have a good time.

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.320
Hopefully I'm really looking forward

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.320
to Harvester. Maybe we'll finish it. Who knows.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:11.320
If there's multiple endings

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.320
I might try all of them.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.320
Who knows.

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.320
Or I might keep one ending.

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:19.320
That might be the case.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.320
But yeah, I'm looking forward to

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.320
the rest of the week and then the following week

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.320
when the following week will be

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.320
much less streams

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.320
and I probably need that dang rest.

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.320
I need that dang rest.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.320
So thank you

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.320
for the stream. I hope

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.320
this was okay for some

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.320
EU, EU bros.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.320
I'm sorry that a lot of people can't catch my streams.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.320
You know how far through

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.320
you got last time? No idea.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.320
No idea. We're on our third

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.320
third thingy.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.320
So I'm probably gonna take a rest next week

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.320
and then recharge myself

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320
again and slowly

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.320
put my streams back to

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.320
five streams a week.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.320
So

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.320
let's get my thingy

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.320
out. My stream thingy

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.320
out. Where's my room?

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.320
Where's my room? Room?

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:19.320
My live room!

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.320
My live room and then

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.320
we'll raid into

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.320
one of the girls

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.320
in one of the

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.320
third.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.320
So let's see.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.320
I'll send you guys

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.320
into Azura

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.320
Azura Dulays

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.320
stream

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.320
because I think she's starting

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.320
starting Stardew Valley.

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.320
Yeah.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.320
Unless she sings for like

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.320
hours again then yeah.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.320
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.320
I'm gonna

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.320
maybe put an ice pack on my

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.320
hives rash again.

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.320
So thank you so much everyone

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.320
for today. I know it's chaotic

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.320
and I'm very sorry

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.320
that you waited a long time

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.320
due to technical difficulties

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.320
but I'm hoping to see you all

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:23.320
tomorrow or another time very soon.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320
Okay.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.320
And that's, let's go!

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.320
Scream for Mercy!

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.320
Thanks for watching!
