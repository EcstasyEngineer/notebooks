21:55.840 --> 22:01.760
where's my eraser tool that the eraser tool that's not the eraser tool

22:05.440 --> 22:14.720
and you're not used to your settings everything becomes frazzled and you didn't have time to

22:14.720 --> 22:20.640
use your settings so now you have to make everything more difficult more difficult than it already is

22:21.920 --> 22:29.760
ah it doesn't erase properly because it acts like a real eraser okay you know what screw this um

22:35.040 --> 22:38.080
motherly

22:43.680 --> 22:44.400
motherly

22:47.520 --> 22:48.000
and

22:52.720 --> 22:54.000
scrawny is

22:56.400 --> 22:56.960
honestly

22:57.200 --> 23:02.960
I don't know why but

23:09.760 --> 23:18.160
but I was like in my mind scrawny was like a raver but I might change that

23:18.720 --> 23:28.720
I was thinking maybe my made princess or star studded superstar

23:35.040 --> 23:36.800
I might actually just go for e-girl

23:41.600 --> 23:42.000
all right

23:42.640 --> 23:51.280
ha ha ha thank you me suck up best for the 3 3 3

24:02.960 --> 24:06.960
yeah the c-girl yeah c-girl

24:07.200 --> 24:16.720
so let's do another layer actually um in this uh they they are going to be very sketchy these

24:16.720 --> 24:24.080
are not going to be like professional our style so we're gonna end up kind of like doing a more

24:24.080 --> 24:29.120
sketchy style like you would do with block coloring and uh that you would see at

24:32.080 --> 24:33.520
in what do you call it

24:34.160 --> 24:38.160
you'll see in um

24:40.720 --> 24:48.160
fashion design sketches okay okay so uh I want to start off with the pencil of course

24:48.160 --> 24:54.480
because pencils are always nice to use I forget my settings mercy can you frown again

24:55.440 --> 25:05.440
like that

25:16.960 --> 25:17.680
okay so

25:18.240 --> 25:28.000
where is my where's my okay we'll start the person who I thought about the most was

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
emi the entire time because emi

25:34.320 --> 25:42.640
it's gonna be so pixelated it looks so much better when it's zoomed out uh pixelated is

25:43.360 --> 25:53.360
is uh because she said that she wanted a kind of an emo outfit so in my idea I wanted kind

25:53.360 --> 26:07.440
of like a precocious a precocious uh little sister emo so basically um the little sister

26:08.400 --> 26:16.240
archetype wants to impress her big bro on the first date and so she wants to look a little

26:16.240 --> 26:24.640
bit more mature a little bit more mature but still very youthful a little bit coquette coquette

26:25.600 --> 26:35.120
uh reflecting off the feelings of uh of the style of what was of uh

26:37.360 --> 26:41.280
gosh I need the movie name again I need the director for this movie

26:41.280 --> 26:45.280
uh

26:50.080 --> 26:56.640
Stanley Kubrick's Stanley Kubrick's uh film lolita

26:59.280 --> 27:08.240
so the fashion back then as well so I've wanted to kind of go in that kind of gothic thing gothic uh

27:09.040 --> 27:23.760
uh precocious uh adolescence that's my that's my um that's my feel that's my that's what I want

27:23.760 --> 27:30.880
to feel like in this outfit so this outfit is going to to kind of reflect emi's darker self

27:30.880 --> 27:36.240
but also her her uh attempt of being seen as a grown-up

27:38.960 --> 27:45.120
wow I'm like explaining something and then people are like we don't care we don't care just draw

27:50.240 --> 27:53.920
okay so with that I've decided we'll do a base

27:56.080 --> 27:57.440
I do a base in my mind

28:01.760 --> 28:07.680
in my mind was I was kind of inspired a little bit by seeing a kind of like

28:07.680 --> 28:14.800
y2k dress that had like all these like neat needle buttons right uh these needle buttons

28:14.800 --> 28:22.400
and a kind of little tiny little v tiny little v the dress was a little bit boxy

28:23.040 --> 28:27.280
which I really enjoyed uh seeing so a boxy dress

28:32.560 --> 28:38.000
by the way this is my body if you think this is emi's body this is my body that I just pasted on

28:38.000 --> 28:43.760
emi her neck's missing uh because I didn't have time to fill it in so there you can get her her

28:43.760 --> 28:55.280
neck like that so uh if if she's a little bit more curvaceous than usual that's because this is me

28:57.440 --> 29:04.800
so I was inspired by a dress that I saw it I think it was like someone uh drew the girls

29:05.680 --> 29:11.920
from blue archive in dirike so specifically um what's her face

29:14.160 --> 29:16.400
the emo one and

29:19.120 --> 29:20.240
the kind of emo one

29:22.560 --> 29:25.200
the smart one in the that's that's with

29:31.440 --> 29:32.960
the dumb the dumb girl

29:34.800 --> 29:35.600
yeah that one

29:42.240 --> 29:49.920
no no no the idiot the idiot from the idiot group the one that bombed everything

29:50.880 --> 29:56.640
and the one girl that pretend she's cool kaioko yeah it was it's kaioko anyways she had a similar

29:56.640 --> 30:03.120
dress like that so the dress had some like rivets and stuff in it which I thought was like really cool

30:04.800 --> 30:14.560
so for emi I was thinking it would be like that um with with that with a nice cute little choker

30:15.840 --> 30:23.200
why why because I think that's very emo I think it's very emo of her

30:27.920 --> 30:32.080
yeah the idiot group yeah problem solver 68 yeah thank you thank you thank you

30:32.160 --> 30:37.920
I was like kind of the emo girl she was wearing kind of a uh a black dress so I love

30:38.800 --> 30:42.640
black dresses black dresses when you think of little black dress it's a dress that's supposed

30:42.640 --> 30:48.160
to go with everything and looks very good on a lot of people so it had rivets and stuff so

30:48.160 --> 30:58.240
we're gonna just fill in this black dress to give it um the feel that um that it is a dress

30:58.240 --> 31:06.080
by the lake we're gonna give her a black dress but then we're gonna emo fire right we're gonna

31:06.080 --> 31:19.280
emo fly black dress we're we're we're talking about um we're talking about my immortal black

31:19.360 --> 31:23.680
lace gloves hot topic emo okay after this

31:30.640 --> 31:38.160
and where where uh the main character describes her outfit for like a total of five pages before

31:38.160 --> 31:43.520
the chapter begins it's great

31:49.600 --> 31:53.120
we're gonna do like a more goth than emo that I now that I think about it

31:54.320 --> 31:56.320
curse me oh my elbow

31:59.280 --> 32:05.200
have you read my immortal dough it's like a pilgrimage towards

32:08.320 --> 32:09.520
towards um

32:12.560 --> 32:14.720
pilgrimage towards um

32:18.640 --> 32:20.640
like internet culture I guess so

32:23.280 --> 32:31.600
what I have designed in mind I designed this in my mind last night and like in the shower

32:31.600 --> 32:36.400
so what we have here is an open zipper outfit which I think is kind of cool

32:38.400 --> 32:41.600
so the zipper uh the attaches around here

32:43.440 --> 32:52.960
and underneath the dress will be another layer another layer I was thinking red of a red fabric

32:52.960 --> 32:56.880
that it's kind of pleated pleated um

32:57.520 --> 32:58.020
um

33:02.400 --> 33:05.120
pleated down so I think that's kind of cute

33:07.600 --> 33:13.760
I hope Emmy kind of likes this design because I think it's like it's got that childish uh

33:13.760 --> 33:20.000
goth look to it but like is also pretty email uh I went to a friend's house to shower

33:20.000 --> 33:33.120
you went to a friend's house to shower my water is still off by the way uh senpai

33:38.080 --> 33:41.520
so we got the pleatedness I don't know if I like this brush but that's okay

33:42.320 --> 33:46.560
the pleated dress underneath it's it's a little bit um

33:47.360 --> 33:50.160
um more

33:54.160 --> 34:00.560
more goth and then like here are the rivets this is like a very rough drawing so rivets

34:04.720 --> 34:14.000
all the way through on it's wonderful okay it gives her kind of like that oof zoom out please

34:14.000 --> 34:24.560
thank you kind of that goth goth look as well if you look at email email back then was uh was kind of

34:27.200 --> 34:28.880
mixed with um

34:32.400 --> 34:39.360
mixed with like the scene with scene and stuff so because it was mixed in with scene and kind of

34:39.360 --> 34:43.680
like email emails mixed in with scene with notably with a lot of

34:45.840 --> 34:55.760
arm warmers uh bracelets etc uh we're gonna go for very cute little arm warmers

34:56.720 --> 34:59.600
and so we're gonna go with the arm warmers here

35:00.320 --> 35:14.240
okay arm warmers I was thinking striped arm warmers so we'll go like this

35:14.480 --> 35:28.000
and so to match the other side we have

35:30.320 --> 35:34.880
the red the red stripes in between

35:45.040 --> 35:55.680
I know this is very rough but I hope uh chat excuse me senpais can visualize it

35:57.840 --> 36:02.000
oh senpais can visualize the sort of uh

36:04.400 --> 36:12.000
cute little little goth gothicness to it chat senpai

36:15.120 --> 36:21.600
the hair color doesn't exactly fit with the goth email theme

36:23.520 --> 36:31.280
shh shh I didn't have if I had time to stew their hair I would because I would put

36:31.840 --> 36:40.080
emmy into a messy bun okay I would put emmy into messy buns messy buns that had like little spikes

36:40.080 --> 36:51.920
sticking out okay that that's really cute

37:00.240 --> 37:03.920
and ow ow ow you can have highlights and stuff later but

37:10.800 --> 37:16.000
okay

37:16.800 --> 37:24.960
going down back then there was very fashionable um garters hanging garters

37:26.400 --> 37:30.560
which I thought would look really cool like they're kind of like bout garters

37:31.200 --> 37:33.920
that would look really cool on on emmy

37:40.720 --> 37:45.920
I think over here she should get like some some some

37:48.800 --> 37:56.960
uh so it'll be like kind of little little eyelet holes goes through here

37:58.480 --> 38:01.920
and of course it's gonna be black why because black matches everything

38:02.240 --> 38:13.760
yeah the image the emmy edge if you will

38:20.880 --> 38:23.200
and then over here we can have the like classic

38:23.440 --> 38:36.320
classic like spiked spiked wrist wrist uh spiked wrist bands with the studs in them

38:39.760 --> 38:40.640
well I can't draw

38:44.240 --> 38:45.760
there you go um

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
um

38:48.320 --> 38:53.360
we are not giving her vans we are giving her dock martins

38:57.120 --> 38:57.440
okay

39:00.560 --> 39:02.160
we are giving her dock martins

39:04.880 --> 39:05.680
dock marks

39:06.480 --> 39:19.120
so what I want emmy to have here is like really we've

39:19.120 --> 39:24.480
have about a little below the knee socks oh shit

39:28.720 --> 39:31.360
we're giving her dock martins dock martins

39:31.680 --> 39:34.640
which are basically combat boots

39:38.560 --> 39:46.560
I feel like demonicas would be a little too ornate for the outfit so I feel like

39:47.120 --> 39:51.840
already on top it's a little bit like middle heavy so I feel like you know the top here

39:51.840 --> 39:57.200
should be a little bit more sparse and down here would be a little bit more simpler so dock

39:57.200 --> 39:59.760
martins are usually combat boots

40:06.720 --> 40:15.920
combat boots and yeah and I feel like emmy would be like big brother hold on big brother

40:15.920 --> 40:24.640
I'm gonna stomp on your nuts

40:30.160 --> 40:37.120
so that's why I'm giving her combat boots because that's what I think she would do

40:38.080 --> 40:49.040
I'm so bad at drawing shoes I've never been good at drawing shoes so we'll we'll we say fuck it

40:49.040 --> 41:03.840
oh they're gonna be like fake dock martins

41:03.840 --> 41:16.640
dock martins have like stripes on it and then

41:16.960 --> 41:27.440
who

41:31.280 --> 41:37.440
excuse me

41:46.640 --> 41:56.500
So, yeah, we got the boots.

41:56.500 --> 42:00.160
And the boots has the little lip on it.

42:00.160 --> 42:05.160
I suck at drawing shoes, don't ever let me draw shoes ever again.

42:05.160 --> 42:10.020
We're visualizing.

42:10.020 --> 42:13.260
You guys can use your imaginations.

42:13.260 --> 42:14.260
It's here.

42:14.260 --> 42:15.260
I don't know.

42:15.260 --> 42:21.600
It's a little lace.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.600
Deckled out.

42:22.600 --> 42:23.600
There we go.

42:23.600 --> 42:35.440
I have to do at least draw nine more shoes.

42:35.440 --> 42:39.240
I'm going to pretend that I'm not going to draw nine more shoes.

42:39.240 --> 42:45.200
By the way, I'm going to pretend that's not a thing.

42:46.200 --> 42:50.200
I hate shoes the most.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.720
Like, do I like the look of shoes?

42:52.720 --> 42:54.220
Of course, I look...

42:54.220 --> 42:56.120
These suck.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.120
It's okay.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.120
We're just...

42:58.120 --> 43:00.520
We're in a sketch phase, right?

43:00.520 --> 43:10.320
Nobody's noticing.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.320
Nobody's noticing.

43:11.320 --> 43:14.320
It's tough for me.

43:15.320 --> 43:19.320
There we go.

43:19.320 --> 43:23.920
But, yeah, I'm thinking her cautious.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.880
She looks so cute, right?

43:26.880 --> 43:27.880
She looks so cute.

43:27.880 --> 43:33.880
If I could, I would put on red eyeshadow for her.

43:33.880 --> 43:36.720
I would move her buns here.

43:36.720 --> 43:40.360
I would move them toward the top of her head.

43:40.360 --> 43:48.240
I would add in the little spray, sparse hairs to make them look like they're spikes.

43:48.240 --> 43:49.240
Like that.

43:49.240 --> 43:53.240
That's what I would do.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.240
Lipstick.

43:54.240 --> 43:59.440
I think a lip gloss would be a pewter.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.440
Last so-to-all?

44:00.440 --> 44:08.360
Can I even do that?

44:08.360 --> 44:11.360
That's what I would think.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.960
I don't know.

44:13.960 --> 44:19.360
I'm not used to Cretan too much, so bevier curve, dynamic, move on.

44:19.360 --> 44:20.360
Close.

44:20.360 --> 44:29.360
She looks just too old, polygons.

44:29.360 --> 44:54.360
She looks just too old, polygons.

44:55.360 --> 45:03.360
I'm very new to this, so I don't know.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.360
I don't know.

45:04.360 --> 45:05.360
I don't know.

45:05.360 --> 45:11.360
I only know how to do this in Photoshop.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.360
But, yeah.

45:12.360 --> 45:15.360
Okay, forget that.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.360
Okay, forget that.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.360
Forget that.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.360
I'll just redraw it.

45:21.360 --> 45:23.360
I'll just redraw it.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.360
Is this easier?

45:25.360 --> 45:36.360
No, but I would just redraw Amy's hair up here, like the side here.

45:36.360 --> 45:42.360
And it would be cute little messy buttons on the side.

45:42.360 --> 45:48.360
I think that would be cute, by the way.

45:48.360 --> 46:01.360
So that was my original vision, and then the little tools here would be the little pin pals.

46:01.360 --> 46:08.360
So it would be like little pin pals, but red.

46:08.360 --> 46:16.360
I think Cretan's last so-to-all is the bean shape selection tool at the bottom.

46:16.360 --> 46:18.360
This thing?

46:18.360 --> 46:22.360
No, freehand?

46:22.360 --> 46:36.360
Oh, maybe it is.

46:36.360 --> 46:48.360
Can I move it?

46:48.360 --> 46:50.360
Sorry, give me a second.

46:50.360 --> 46:57.360
I'm still learning from here.

46:57.360 --> 47:02.360
Can I move it?

47:02.360 --> 47:20.360
Can I turn it?

47:20.360 --> 47:26.360
It just imagined this.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.360
I'd have a layer below it.

47:28.360 --> 47:36.360
Never mind, you know what?

47:36.360 --> 47:38.360
Can we just...

47:38.360 --> 47:44.360
I'll just wipe this out here.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.360
Is this...

47:46.360 --> 47:49.360
Is Mercy kind of dumb?

47:49.360 --> 47:51.360
Yes.

47:51.360 --> 47:55.360
Can you just...

47:55.360 --> 47:59.360
Where's my color tool?

47:59.360 --> 48:06.360
Yeah, we'll just...

48:06.360 --> 48:12.360
Can I fill that?

48:12.360 --> 48:14.360
Forget it!

48:14.360 --> 48:15.360
Forget it!

48:15.360 --> 48:16.360
Forget it!

48:16.360 --> 48:18.360
I give up.

48:18.360 --> 48:31.360
What is this?

48:31.360 --> 48:33.360
I wanted to pick a thing...

48:33.360 --> 48:35.360
I'll learn Cretan later.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.360
I'll learn Cretan later, okay?

48:37.360 --> 48:39.360
Okay, shut up.

48:39.360 --> 48:56.360
I'll learn Cretan later.

48:56.360 --> 49:05.360
A lot of Emile and Goth, of course, have skulls and stripes and fishnets and stuff like that.

49:05.360 --> 49:08.360
So, guess what?

49:08.360 --> 49:11.360
We're going to add socks!

49:11.360 --> 49:16.360
Striped socks, obviously.

49:16.360 --> 49:23.360
It's all white, isn't it?

49:23.360 --> 49:28.360
I had better tools when I was on the side.

49:28.360 --> 49:37.360
So, we have socks right over here.

49:37.360 --> 49:49.360
I'm thinking about adding in a bit of white, white socks, so that it can give that little bit of emile contrast.

49:49.360 --> 50:02.360
I don't want Emile to be like, fully stripe-heavy.

50:02.360 --> 50:08.360
So, I might just do a plain sock on the other, or no sock, it depends.

50:08.360 --> 50:10.360
What am I feeling?

50:10.360 --> 50:13.360
What am I feeling?

50:13.360 --> 50:15.360
No, no, no, screw it.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.360
Screw it.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.360
You know, I said I wanted socks.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.360
I changed my mind.

50:22.360 --> 50:24.360
I changed my mind.

50:24.360 --> 50:30.360
I'm going to go...

50:30.360 --> 50:32.360
I changed my mind.

50:32.360 --> 50:36.360
I'm going to change my mind.

50:36.360 --> 50:39.360
It means going to steal my style.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.360
We're going to do fishnets.

50:41.360 --> 50:43.360
We're going to do fishnets.

50:43.360 --> 50:46.360
She's going to steal my style.

50:46.360 --> 50:54.360
We're going to do fishnets.

50:54.360 --> 50:56.360
We're going to do fishnets.

50:56.360 --> 51:03.360
Why? Because I think it will balance it out a little more.

51:03.360 --> 51:06.360
I think it will look really cute otherwise.

51:06.360 --> 51:09.360
Ooh, I have an idea.

51:09.360 --> 51:16.360
We can have her have like a little, her tattoo over here instead.

51:16.360 --> 51:18.360
That would be cute, I think.

51:18.360 --> 51:24.360
Or on the other side, I don't really know.

51:24.360 --> 51:28.360
I wanted her hair to be like up here, but I just didn't have time.

51:28.360 --> 51:36.360
So, that, and then if she wanted, she could have her little...

51:36.360 --> 51:40.360
Her little second necklace.

51:40.360 --> 51:44.360
Layering necklaces is very in trend nowadays.

51:44.360 --> 51:47.360
So, it gives it a little bit of a modern twist.

51:47.360 --> 51:50.360
She can have a little like skull necklace or something.

51:50.360 --> 51:55.360
Or a crystal, whatever, you know?

51:55.360 --> 52:03.360
Of course, it wouldn't be Emmy without a few little cute, cute things.

52:03.360 --> 52:12.360
So, she can have herself, her little hammer here still.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.360
She can keep her little hammer there.

52:14.360 --> 52:20.360
Who knows, maybe she wants a little knife, depends on how she feels.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.360
Maybe a little spells and stuff.

52:22.360 --> 52:30.360
She can be held onto these beautiful little garters.

52:30.360 --> 52:33.360
She's nice to have options. She can have whatever she wants.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.360
It's Emmy after all.

52:35.360 --> 52:45.360
So, Emmy's outfit is very simple, but I think with the zipper opening dress,

52:45.360 --> 52:53.360
with the pleated adding double textures, as well as kind of like having a upper,

52:53.360 --> 53:00.360
a little bit of a heavy upper and like the lower part is a little bare bones.

53:00.360 --> 53:05.360
The plainness, it gives it a bit more cute look.

53:05.360 --> 53:08.360
Simplistic look makes it more cute.

53:08.360 --> 53:12.360
Not very heavy.

53:12.360 --> 53:13.360
It's not very heavy.

53:13.360 --> 53:17.360
It won't be as...

53:17.360 --> 53:24.360
It's overall a very plain shape, but the plainness gives it the more adolescent look to it.

53:24.360 --> 53:28.360
It gives kind of a little bit of mature vibe to it.

53:28.360 --> 53:30.360
Very cute in my opinion.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.360
So, there we have it.

53:31.360 --> 53:37.360
There we have Emmy's gothic outfit.

53:37.360 --> 53:41.360
I think I'm done unless...

53:41.360 --> 53:43.360
Unless Senpai's have better ideas.

53:43.360 --> 53:48.360
I feel like base is based off what I did.

53:48.360 --> 53:57.360
I think this is pretty decent because the kind of like simpler look makes her look a bit more mature.

53:57.360 --> 54:02.360
Mature, but her petite-ness makes her look very young, very young and youthful.

54:02.360 --> 54:12.360
Of course, like a little sister.

54:12.360 --> 54:18.360
This is up to Emmy if she wants to like base off of it or something,

54:18.360 --> 54:21.360
but this was what I had in my head and that was the clearest image I had.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.360
She was the first one I had in my head.

54:23.360 --> 54:34.360
I was like, yes, my emo goth.

54:34.360 --> 54:37.360
That's what I had in the head.

54:37.360 --> 54:47.360
This is the Emmy outfit.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.360
She may have anything she wants with it.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.360
She can have a...

54:51.360 --> 55:00.360
She can carry her little backpack of her pin pal.

55:00.360 --> 55:05.360
Because the plush backpacks were in back then.

55:05.360 --> 55:09.360
I don't remember what pin pals really looked like.

55:09.360 --> 55:18.360
But she can have a pin pal backpack if she wanted.

55:18.360 --> 55:21.360
As well.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.360
Makes it accessorizing.

55:23.360 --> 55:30.360
Looks very cute in my opinion.

55:30.360 --> 55:35.360
She can hold it in her hand to show off or she can have it on her back.

55:35.360 --> 55:39.360
So when she turns around you're like, you know,

55:39.360 --> 55:43.360
when she turns around she's like, are you looking at my backpack?

55:43.360 --> 55:46.360
Big brill.

55:46.360 --> 55:49.360
Can't you have a gun though? The gun's in the backpack, okay?

55:49.360 --> 55:57.360
Use your imagination, senpai.

55:57.360 --> 56:01.360
I don't quite remember what they look like, but you know, maybe...

56:01.360 --> 56:08.360
Oh dear, I actually put it on a rice.

56:08.360 --> 56:11.360
She can't even have like a big zipper here.

56:11.360 --> 56:22.360
It just has all her little goodies and stuff in it.

56:22.360 --> 56:28.360
Wonderful. I think this is a great start.

56:28.360 --> 56:35.360
Let me just do some color stuff. Where is orange?

56:35.360 --> 56:38.360
Let me just fill in some stuff.

56:38.360 --> 56:44.360
Because we have a lot of girls to go through.

56:44.360 --> 56:48.360
We have a lot of girls to go through.

56:48.360 --> 57:14.360
But I think this is pretty fucking cute if you ask me.

57:14.360 --> 57:36.360
I don't remember what pin pals look like, but I think this is how my pin pal will look like.

57:36.360 --> 57:41.360
There you go.

57:42.360 --> 57:50.360
I will do the two canoes first.

57:50.360 --> 58:00.360
I'm sorry for my...

58:00.360 --> 58:13.360
Lack of Photoshop skills, because I just don't have time to draw a full head and full base.

58:13.360 --> 58:24.360
But this is Emmy's outfit if I could remove these.

58:24.360 --> 58:29.360
I can remove these and move them up here.

58:29.360 --> 58:36.360
And have them a little bit more sparse so that her little hair strays will look like spikier.

58:36.360 --> 58:45.360
Use Tomatoes 5 up and down.

58:45.360 --> 58:54.360
There are tomatoes now.

58:54.360 --> 59:02.360
Cookie scale with pins.

59:02.360 --> 59:13.360
There are unripe tomatoes now.

59:13.360 --> 59:27.360
They're fine.

59:27.360 --> 59:33.360
Oh well, I think that's cute. I still think it's cute.

59:33.360 --> 59:42.360
I don't remember. Oh well, they're orange tomatoes.

59:42.360 --> 59:53.360
Don't point out tomatoes, it looks like you're throwing them at me.

59:53.360 --> 01:00:00.360
Cookie.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:06.360
That's Emmy's outfit.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:15.360
Okay, so for my beautiful icy.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:31.360
My beautiful icy. Oh my gosh, sorry. I still love how I designed her outfit. I'm sorry. I'm admiring my own work.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:39.360
For icy, I want her to be a princess. Why? Because she deserves to be a princess.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:46.360
But not just any princess. We're going Elsa with her. She's going to be an ice princess.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:59.360
And you know what? She lives up somewhere real cold. I don't know where.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:06.360
So she needs to be warm. Okay. She needs to be warm.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:15.360
But as well with icy, she's a little bit feral, so we don't want something too prim and proper.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:23.360
Understood? Understood, Senpai? We don't want something too prim and proper. We want it to be easy moving.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:34.360
Easy moving, but also very cute. Not completely prim and proper. Just a little bit.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:41.360
Maybe give it kind of like, you know, the fallen princess type of look.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:48.360
Okay, we keep her pause. Yeah, just ignore the fact that she has no pause.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:57.360
The reason why is because this is my body. I just took away the tits.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:05.360
Okay, I just took away, you know.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:12.360
I just took away the tits. These are all my body except for Azra. Azra is not my body.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:24.360
This is all my body, okay, so that everyone has to look at me.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:41.360
Okay. So for icy, I also take into effect that she's also a DJ or a club.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.360
So we might go with a little rave princess for her. It depends on how I feel.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:03:03.360
But starting from my head thought, I want her to have these big fuzzy leg warmers.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:09.360
I don't know if it will look good, but we'll see.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.360
Well, gray, we will use gray for them.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.360
The leg warmers, you often see them at raves because...

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:24.360
Actually, I don't know why.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.360
I don't know why.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.360
I honestly don't know why.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:52.360
I don't go to raves, so I don't know their culture.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.360
Because it's outside and it gets cold, okay.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:24.360
So I really want I see to have these big fuzzy, beautiful, beautiful leg warmers.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:44.360
We'll color these in so it gives the effect that looks like it's fur.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:05:03.360
I also wanted to listen, I wanted Senpai to listen to music today, but I don't want to get hit by copyright.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:19.360
I want Senpai to listen to my music instead.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:28.360
There's a lot of differences.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:37.360
It's really hard, at least on YouTube, to have music.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:43.360
If you export it, the music is gone because you can separate the audio for that.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:53.360
That's not really possible on here, so I couldn't do something like that.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:06:22.360
We'll make the top a little gray just because I think it will go nicely with this beautiful white fur.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:29.360
Okay, let's continue on.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:39.360
I know rave outfits tend to have a little bit of a...

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:54.360
The silhouette is very narrow within, but on the arms and the back, it tends to be more fluffy and pretty.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:07:04.360
So we're going to go with a cute little design.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:22.360
I think she would look like a great little princess if I can just make the silhouette cute, like a little snow princess.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:49.360
Ignore the fact that this is my body. I am asking you, once again, to ignore the fact that this is my body.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:08:02.360
Long style, maybe?

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:08.360
Crown, I think she would love a crown.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:30.360
But also, I think around here would be wonderful with a fur over the show, draping, draping, draping sleeves.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:53.360
I think that's cute as well.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.360
I love it when the shoulders, usually I don't think.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:17.360
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it's very common to completely cover the shoulders in some way in rave outfits.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:25.360
Is it weird for Icy to wear fur? She is wearing fur in her regular outfit!

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:38.360
Of course, I want her to have a beautiful crown as well.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:49.360
A beautiful crown as well.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:10:14.360
Because she is our princess, I think a little wired crown would be very nice on her.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:25.360
But as well, for the sleeves, I feel like it would be really cute if she had the very long kimono sleeves.

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:34.360
I want to make it over the top for her outfit, but I feel like it just gives her that sense of warmth.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:45.360
Meanwhile, most of her will be kind of exposed.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:11:07.360
It makes her look more queenly and princessy, and it makes her look cute.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:24.360
So here, it would be kind of like, here would be the outfit, and then we can add in, so, no, that's not bad.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:31.360
Here, let me draw this so it kind of seems like it's an easier outfit to look at.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.360
No, you know what? Screw that. I don't want round, no, I don't want sharp.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:51.360
She's cute, so she'll get a little bit of a round breastplate.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:12:03.360
And then down here, I would say that she'll get, like, a classic rave-er, rave-er stripes, I guess?

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:15.360
Oh, no, no, no, I've never been to a rave before, and I don't party, okay? I don't party senpai, so if anyone doesn't like this idea...

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:21.360
My bad!

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:39.360
I think it's cute. A lot of rave outfits are very ornate as well, so I'm thinking, like, a little bit of, like, a heart here would be very cute.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:59.360
Yeah, let's expose her tummy. You know what? Expose her tummy. That makes her look very cute.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:21.360
What? Heart cutouts here to match the top? These are cutouts, so I just think they're... yeah.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:47.360
Is that too much? Hmm. Hmm. Eh, I'm lost in the sauce. Lost in the sauce as in, like, I'm just, like, debating on, like, how princess it can be without making it too overbearing.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:14:02.360
I'm debating. I'm debating, because, like, I'm not very familiar with rave outfits, and I don't want to make it be, like, oh, this is too rave, or it's not cute and not princess rave enough.

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:24.360
Where's her light up pinkie? I'll draw it. I'll draw it later. Around her neck. She can have her royal ring. She can have her ring.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:15:01.360
I've never been to a rave, so I thought of this outfit for her, and then I was, like, I don't actually know if people will wear this to raves. That's the problem.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:25.360
I think it's actually too much behind her right now. What did I do? Oh. Oh, wrong base. No. That's the side. Okay. I might actually erase that, because that's too much.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:51.360
Like, I think Emmy's design was, like, more flourished in my mind, and Icy's was not quite there yet. It was not quite there yet. Like, basically the legs and the sleeves were there, but then the middle of the outfit wasn't there yet.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:16:20.360
Like, basically the sleeves were, like, yes, I've got it. Like, it's going to be that sparkly fabric that, like, they have at raves that people love so much. It shimmers and shines, and, you know, it'll be kind of the same thing here.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:47.360
I think this is better. I think, yeah, I think that's better, actually. Sequences, no. It's, like, kind of, like, very sparkly, the very sparkly material. It's not actually sparkly, but just sparkle.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:17:05.360
It gives her a little bit of a cuter, mature look. I do want her to have, like, a little raver backpack and stuff as well. So, actually, we're going to do a little bit of some changes here, because I didn't like what I did down here.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:24.360
So, we're going to erase that. We're going to erase that. I'm so messy. I'm so sorry I wasn't as prepared for the stream as I was before. I was going to do the heart cutouts, but now I think it's too much.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:36.360
A new heart cutout. But now I think it's too much.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:47.360
Ugh, you're such a cute princess. You're such a cute princess. I love her.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:58.360
Okay, let's try. Let's try. We got to give her the cutesy princess look, so.

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:18.360
Brace her off. Right on. This time we'll do this, and then we'll do, like, a little ruffle skirt.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:29.360
Okay, yeah, there we go. Now I'm cooking. Now I'm cooking. Now I'm cooking. Lip cooking.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:51.360
I love what you did with Emmys. Emmys was already in my mind for a while, and you know what, Azraza's also was on my mind, and I have a few, like, ideas for, for, for...

01:18:51.360 --> 01:19:05.360
Shibi, and then Strawny. I have a few ideas for as well, but it's not fully cooked up, like, I see.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:19.360
Like, I see. So there we go. There we go. Yes, cute. Cute. Cute. Very cute. That looks so much better. Oh my gosh, why didn't I do this before?

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:27.360
Classic grave princess look.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:20:18.360
Here. Cute. The color as well, and then here. It's like this, so it's cinched in the middle.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:43.360
Cinched in the middle, cinched in the middle, with a little bit of extra fabric hanging out. We'll take this color, and then we add in a few little ribbons, because that's what she would want.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:54.360
Because that's what she would want. And then I'm thinking her neck looks a little bare.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:21:20.360
So we're gonna add in a little bit of a little, of a simple necklace with her binky there. She can wear her, like, bedazzled little binky and stuff. I think if I can get this to not...

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:38.360
I can get this to somehow look rough, you know, over and underneath. I think we're just about done. I see as well.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:51.360
It's really hard to work with, because sometimes on skin it just doesn't show up.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:19.360
Especially when you want to, like, highlight some things, but then it just looks like it's just white, you know?

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:38.360
So yeah, I think I see how if it's really cute, she can wear a little backpack that makes her look like, you know, like she can wear her little light up backpacks or whatever that makes her look like, I don't know, a little fairy.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:23:18.360
Give me a second. I need to see what a butterfly wings look like.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.360
Okay.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:24:17.360
Okay, there we go. What do you think? I think it's cute. I think she'd like it. I think she'll move around with it. It's not completely prim. I think it's still good.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:41.360
It still gives her a little bit of the feral look to it. Yeah, yeah, I think that's good. I'm not that much... I'm not a very... I'm not a seasoned artist or anything so.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:25:05.360
That's what I think and I'm just like, you know, Rave's, yeah, she'll love it. She can have this outfit for when she goes to Rave's and, you know, it's easy to move in, she'll be able to dance and she'll be able to do her hunting as well.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:28.360
Please ignore the hands. I'm too lazy to draw and pause. She will have her cute little polar bear paws. Bear feet, by the way. Oh gosh.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:54.360
Oh shit. Give me a second. They're chunky white boots. They're chunky white boots, yeah. Shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up. They're chunky white boots, yeah.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:24.360
White's always like an off-grey. Yeah. Shit. Imagine those are like the... Hold on. I can do so much better than this. Little grippers. I don't know.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:57.360
Fuck it. She gets the platform boots that have like fake snow on them. You're good. There you go. Actually, that does look good. It's platform. Transparent platforms. Okay.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:27.360
I think it looks great. Add it to her eye. She'll love it, okay? She can stomp on it like glass. Yeah, it's like Cinderella, okay? Cinderella, Cinderella. Oh my gosh, I'm gonna get something. It's fine.

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:54.360
That's fine. I feel like shebeads. Not shebeads. Gosh, Emmy. Emmy and I see would like go out together in these outfits. I think these are cute. You really want these girls to stomp on stuff. She really would stomp on you, okay? She'll bite you.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:18.360
She'll bite you and stuff. So I think these two will definitely go out and have some fun. Maybe go to the ice hole or something. Maybe go on a girly get together like a cafe or something.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:25.360
Things like that. I think that's cute, okay?

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:43.360
They're like besties, okay? They look so cute together. Yeah, I think it's cute. I think it's cute.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.360
Okay, who do I start with next?

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360
Next.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:29:19.360
I'll do Azra because I already have a very simple outfit in mind. I have a simple outfit

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:28.360
in mind for her. Don't think that simple is bad. Simple shows off the goods, okay?

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:38.360
I'm winking, but you can't tell. I can't believe this is Kohai's body. This is the only one that's not my body.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:55.360
What I want for Azra and I've been salivating at this, okay? I've been salivating at this idea.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.360
Sleeveless turtleneck.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:28.360
Sleeveless turtleneck.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.360
Sorry, I am cooming at the top.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.360
I don't have steady hands for this right now.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:16.360
I got my tour box working, but then it didn't decide not to work again.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.360
You're doing what now?

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:40.360
Cumin. Cumin, yeah, cumin at the thought. You know, the spice.

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:05.360
I'm just going to fill this in because it's a lot.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.360
I swear I'm going to be cooking.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.360
I swear I'm going to be cooking with this thought.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:34.360
It represents, I always love this type of like the sweater because it's so motherly.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.360
Sorry, excuse me for being like this.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:06.360
My entire life I was just like, that's too small.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.360
I always misclick.

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:18.360
Too big. This is why I want my tour box to work, but it decided to not work like a little bish.

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:46.360
Sorry, excuse me.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:56.360
She just looks so good in it. I thought it would look good, but now I'm right.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:04.360
I was like, she'll look so good in like an oversized, like in this like kind of tight fitting sleeveless sweater.

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:29.360
I was like, she'll look so good in like an oversized, like in this like kind of tight fitting sleeveless sweater and I was like Turtleneck sweater, I was right.

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.360
I was right. She looks so good in it.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.360
Sorry.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.360
She looks so good in it.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.360
Some lines, alright some lines.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:05.360
There we go.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:10.360
I'm gonna do a little over half. Of course I am. Of course.

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:24.360
Oh, god damn, she looks really good. She looks really good on that.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:41.360
Okay, now.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.360
I'm gonna add in.

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:05.360
Like, these are very popular nowadays.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.360
Oh, I'm gonna get added.

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:18.360
A see-through button-up shirt that's kind of slipping off her shoulders.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.360
Very popular nowadays.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:51.360
So it's gonna be buttoned up over here, now it's falling off her and it's slightly, I don't care, as well.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:57.360
I'll put in the details later, but I kind of want to give this effect transparency.

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:25.360
It's very popular nowadays, you can see it.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:35.360
You'll see it a lot in like medias where it's kind of like this like very pretty transparency.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.360
Hold on, let me grab a better, darker pencil for this.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.360
Brush for this, so.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.360
Maybe that's two?

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.360
Bigger?

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:57.360
So it's got this like transparency in it.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:16.360
It's very hard to like show based off of the brushes, but I'm sure some artists has a better idea of how to like show this transparency.

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:33.360
Of like this kind of like chiffon dress shirt where they have like the button-ups and it's just falling off of her.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.360
Because it can't fully fit.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:45.360
It's all done, it's a grocery bag.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:51.360
Now it's a see-through shirt, see-through chiffon shirt.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.360
Okay, button-up shirt.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.360
Shut up.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.360
Pfft.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.360
Solid layer change transparency.

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.360
Actually, that was a better idea.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:18.360
Rosie too, that was a better idea, what the heck?

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360
What was I thinking?

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.360
What was I thinking? Clearly not.

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.360
Pfft.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.360
This paintbrush is terrible.

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.360
This paintbrush is terrible.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.360
I thought I would be able to do like a thicker line with it, and then I didn't want to do it.

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.360
Where's my cursor?

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:10.360
There it is.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.360
Okay, okay.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.360
This one's better.

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:30.360
Okay.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.360
Like that.

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:59.360
Actually, I could just leave it like that.

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:05.360
I think it gives it, I think I can just leave it like that, because then it'll make it look like it's, you know.

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:15.360
It makes it kind of look transparent, but also like with the outline, you can kind of see what I'm going for.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.360
Sort of.

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.360
Pfft.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.360
Pfft.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.360
Pfft.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:47.360
Underneath, you can see this really cool belt, and then I just want Azra to wear mom jeans.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:51.360
Okay, I want her to wear mom jeans with this outfit.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.360
It's so plain.

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:54.360
I know it's a plain outfit.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.360
I know that she deserves better, but I am weak.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.360
I am weak.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.360
I am weak for the denim.

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:28.360
I am so weak for the denim with a big gold belt.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.360
What's the difference between normal jeans and mom jeans?

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:43.360
A little bit more closely.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.360
One is more shapely than the other.

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:49.360
You're welcome.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:43:05.360
It tends to be more shapely and more, uh, holding on to the curves.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:13.360
Am I mistaking them?

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.360
Whatever, she's wearing jeans.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.360
Am I mistaking mom jeans?

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:18.360
Oh, whatever.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.360
Whatever.

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.360
Whatever.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.360
Whatever, I just...

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.360
Did you guys tell I gotta give up here?

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:39.360
It's bigger.

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:53.740
Is are my Senpai's gas lighting me because then that could be a thing

01:43:53.740 --> 01:44:14.380
oh making this all in one layer call hi yeah I'm actually trying to like just

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:20.460
get the idea yeah yeah out first this is too big that's fine I'm getting the

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:25.740
idea out first and then maybe it's very rough it's very rough I don't want to

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:33.500
make this an entirely big stream where I spend the entire time meticulously

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:38.300
making beautiful outfits because I'm just like I just want the idea out I'm

01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:45.500
designing I'm designing and I'm on a new program with all my all my tools that

01:44:45.500 --> 01:45:01.940
I'm unfamiliar with off so now I'm just I don't I don't remember my settings from

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:06.180
my other accounts so I try to get into my other account and then it wouldn't work

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:20.820
and then yeah I'm just gonna get the idea out I'm just gonna get the idea out

01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:31.980
because we're getting the idea out we're just winging it want her underneath this

01:45:31.980 --> 01:46:01.140
layer very nice brown brown belt the transparency part got me got me

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:21.460
tilted I was like oh I can't show this as well as I wanted to reason why I wanted

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:26.900
like the kind of like chiffon sweater wearing on top is because I wanted to

01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:35.340
like you like gives it that sexy feel the sexy mommy feel you know and then

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:44.460
with that we can have sexy mommy feel the denims should probably be a

01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:48.740
different color but whatever and then we can have her have a very beautiful

01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:56.260
and jumps a necklace based off of her

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:40.340
of course it's a classic she'll be wearing heels regular heels I can't draw

01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:42.700
shoes

01:47:51.300 --> 01:48:02.020
regular see let those as I think they look pretty I'm forgetful of how it looks

01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:14.940
like very simple but I just really love it I just really love the way the way

01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:23.060
that this looks it's simple it's plain you can tell she's mother yeah

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:36.540
oh she looks so good and like a sweater like a sleeveless sweater top oh that

01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:43.540
just looks good I think that just good in my opinion I just it's simple but it's

01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:49.020
an outfit that anyone can wear and I feel like she just wants to to go in

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:56.260
comfort her first date with you would be like heist it's like I don't know hi

01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:06.580
sweetie kind of thing hi sweetie it's very it's very simple but I think yeah

01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:11.580
she'll love it if she doesn't like the top of the like top she can just take it

01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:14.260
off easy

01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:28.220
okay mommy mommy time and then we'll do shabby

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.100
you

01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:55.100
Okay.

01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:57.100
How e-girl am I doing?

01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:03.100
Cause I didn't have like a full, like a full, fully fra-

01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:04.100
uh

01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:14.100
Full idea for her at first, but then I was like

01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:17.100
Now let's go, let's go with it

01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:24.100
Actually, I think I got an idea

01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:26.100
I got an idea, I got an idea

01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:30.100
Mame will probably hate me for it

01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:32.100
Or she'll love me for it, who fucking knows

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:34.100
Thank you

01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:50.100
This is just me shooting out ideas already

01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:53.100
I'm sorry if everyone's like, oh she's not a good artist at all

01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:54.100
I fucking hate her

01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:56.100
I don't care

01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:02.100
Okay, whoosh

01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:05.100
Let's sketch out the idea real fast

01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:30.100
Let's sketch out the idea really fast here

01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:25.100
Okay, I think that's a good basis

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:29.100
Reeflings

01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:31.100
Reefling

01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.100
Okay, okay

01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:34.100
Let's go through bottom to top

01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:36.100
Reefling

01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.100
Slippers

01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:40.100
House slippers

01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:41.100
She's a gamer

01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:43.100
Reefling house slippers

01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.100
Thy high socks

01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.100
Pleaded, uh

01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:50.100
Pleaded plaid

01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:54.100
Gert

01:52:56.100 --> 01:53:00.100
With a slipping kind of lazy graphic font

01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:06.100
Shirt will add in like belts

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:08.100
And stuff, make it very e-girl

01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:13.100
With a kind of like fishy gamer headset

01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.100
Bra, bra strap, what bra does she wear?

01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:20.100
What bra does she, does mommy wear?

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.100
Reefling house slippers

01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:38.100
So this is my thought

01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:41.100
I've sketched it out just a little bit

01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:43.100
Yes, yes

01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.100
We are gonna cook

01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:47.100
She going commando?

01:53:56.100 --> 01:54:00.100
Well, if you know mommy enough

01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:03.100
Come on, let me search up what reeflings look like

01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.100
What reeflings look like again

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:12.100
Cause I'm kinda dumbble

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:27.100
Okay, I got it

01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.100
House slippers

01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:58.100
Alright

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.100
Yes, yes

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.100
Yes

01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:23.100
Yes

01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:26.100
Haha

01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:30.100
Not gonna be perfect, sorry reeflings

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:41.100
It's not gonna be perfect

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:43.100
But I'm gonna do my best

01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:46.100
To give you a basic idea of what I want

01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.100
Because she's always steppin' on ya

01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:56.100
Oh my gosh, she rented it

01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:02.100
I love you

01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:06.100
Ignore the fact that you can see her feet

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:09.100
Ignore it, ignore it, we're doing just the basic thing

01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.100
If I had more time

01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:21.100
I would probably make this better

01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:23.100
But I don't

01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:26.100
So, you're gonna just take it

01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:40.100
Reeflings have a little bit of pink on their tentacles as well

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:44.100
Here we go

01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:47.100
And, yeah

01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:51.100
I love you

01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:56.100
Okay, oh, okay

01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:59.100
I'm so glad inspiration hit me like a fucking

01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:01.100
Like a fucking truck, okay

01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:15.100
Okay, ignore that this is gonna look like trash

01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.100
For like a second

01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.100
I want her to have

01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:27.100
Like this is gonna be like as fast as I can possibly do it

01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:42.100
Here's my pencil

01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:45.100
Ansel, get over here, thank you

01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.100
I took her like, shut up

01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:06.100
Yeah

01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:09.100
One side

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:15.100
The other side

01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:27.100
I'll be more careful on this side

01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:40.100
Whoo

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.100
It's like

01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:48.100
Mercy, are your sketches as chaotic as this?

01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:50.100
Yes, yes they are

01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:53.100
If I had more time

01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:56.100
Because my water got shut off

01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:58.100
And I was like panicking a little bit

01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:01.100
And then I was like, oh my gosh, I have so much to do

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.100
If I had more time

01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:05.100
I would

01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:07.100
I would

01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:10.100
I would probably have sketched this

01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:14.100
Beforehand and started to add more design elements

01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:16.100
And so

01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:22.100
I think this is gonna be cute

01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:24.100
I think this is gonna be cute

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:26.100
So, what I wanted was like

01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:29.100
Her little swan mix match socks

01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:32.100
Cute

01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:34.100
To be like her little

01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:38.100
Swirlies like her hypnotism

01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:41.100
Cuttle hypnotism thing

01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:47.100
Of course

01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:49.100
For the pink, she'll be having

01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:51.100
Sure

01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:53.100
Skirt

01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:58.100
I was thinking more of her like

01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:00.100
Pink swirly eyes

02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:02.100
That she has is very simple

02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:10.100
Skirt

02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.100
Like this

02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.100
Not gonna look that great

02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:40.100
I'm so unfamiliar with everything

02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:48.100
All my settings are gone

02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:50.100
On this account and I was dumb

02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:10.100
Ugh

02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:18.100
Quintessential e-girl outfits

02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:20.100
Or a plaid skirt

02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.100
Sorry, that's just the way it is

02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:25.100
Probably comes from like

02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:27.100
You know

02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.100
Schoolgirl stuff

02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:34.100
But Quintessential, very plain

02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:36.100
You know what? I'm thinking

02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:38.100
I'm gonna see if this works but

02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:41.100
You think we can get

02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.100
Pink swirls on this side too?

02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:45.100
Or is that too much?

02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.100
I think that's too much

02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:53.100
Maybe it's too much

02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:56.100
Yeah, you know what? I'm scrapping that idea

02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.100
I'm scrapping that idea

02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:05.100
And then

02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:10.100
I want her to still have

02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:12.100
The kind of like

02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:14.100
Cuttlefish

02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:19.100
Her like little reefling colors

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:23.100
So we're gonna

02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:25.100
Block this in

02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:27.100
I

02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:34.100
Have mummy look like a foal

02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:38.100
Oh my gosh, what was that that run?

02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:42.100
A foal

02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.100
E-girl

02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:52.100
E-girl gamer

02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:58.100
E-girl gamer

02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:03.100
Maybe give her a star on this cheek?

02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.100
Sure

02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.100
Lose the mustache, it's not fooling me

02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.100
Look, the mustache moves funny, okay?

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:17.100
I think it's great

02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:28.100
Oh

02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:32.100
Gosh

02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:35.100
I wish I had my own settings

02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:37.100
Because these are a little rough

02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:43.100
Discord kitten

02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:57.100
Why don't you use your other account?

02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:59.100
I'm not allowed to

02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:01.100
Also safety reason

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:02.100
Safeties

02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:04.100
Safety reasons

02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:06.100
If I'm on this account

02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:09.100
It's everything about it is mercy

02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:11.100
And all my other account is personal

02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.100
Is she the kitten or you're the kitten?

02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:25.100
Shirt says discord moderator

02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:55.100
I

02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:17.800
Don't know I don't actually know what I should do for a shirt. So here's like I don't know

02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:25.100
I

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:42.100
Think I need a different brush for that

02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:44.100
Maybe this one

02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:46.100
I'm experimenting with brushes

02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:55.100
Sure, let's go with that

02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:04.100
I would draw this cotton flag, but yeah

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:12.100
And then here

02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:14.100
We can have her have

02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:19.100
It can be whatever shirt, honestly

02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:21.100
It can be like I

02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:23.100
Survive scrawny's

02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:30.100
Survive scrawny killing me. I don't know

02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:40.100
Oh gosh, I need a better yellow than that

02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:45.100
Tootery yellow not like gold, but like yellow

02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:53.100
There's your star

02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.100
There's your star

02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:08.100
Actually that looks really good

02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:17.100
Cat ear headphones are not these headphones are fish fins. I just sketched it out really badly

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.100
I

02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:40.100
Think it has elements of e-girl, but also elements of scrawny in it too

02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:46.100
I am so bad at this

02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:53.100
Let me just like Google what the like e-girl cat girl

02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:59.100
Headphones kind of look like and then I'll just sort of mimic the look of it

02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:09.100
This is so very sketchy though

02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:18.100
Oh

02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:29.100
Oh, I want to get to to she bees as well

02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:34.100
So I don't want to like spend too long on each person even though I think I spent the longest on icys

02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:37.100
I think I spent the longest on icys just because

02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:48.100
I

02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:18.100
Probably

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:40.100
Honestly, I've been watching you you haku show so everyone who watches who knows jury

02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:46.100
The the announcement girl. Yeah, I kind of I'm kind of basing the fins off of her

02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:12.100
And

02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:26.100
Then maybe if I want I can add her like little little fins here

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:32.100
Make her look like a cullfish

02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:37.100
Yeah

02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:46.100
Give me a second. I want to make this even more e-girl than this is to go further beyond

02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:51.100
This is to go further beyond

02:10:57.100 --> 02:11:01.100
E-girl strappy strappy belt stuff

02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:10.100
I

02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:25.100
There we go

02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:35.100
What was what's this menu

02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.100
I click something

02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:42.100
I click something. What the heck?

02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:46.100
What the heck is that how do I undo that?

02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:53.100
What menu has appeared and how do I undo it?

02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:00.100
What did I do?

02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:02.100
What the heck you wiki

02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:10.100
Wow

02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:27.100
Was it like a tool thing

02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:35.100
My thingy gonna work now where I can rotate this

02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:38.100
No

02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:40.100
Press 5 to return to normal. Oh

02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:43.780
Thank you senpai

02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:48.100
Okay, oh my gosh

02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:55.100
Thank you

02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:02.380
The menu comes up by right clicking I believe I haven't touched it in a long time. So yeah, we are back. We are so back

02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:10.100
Let me double-check strone's design because I love strone

02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:38.100
Okay, hold on

02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:52.100
It still has like her like plaster bandages on her on her arm there and

02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:56.100
She still has it

02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:02.100
Nice

02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:07.100
Oh

02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:14.780
Small details

02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:25.740
Sorry, they're very sketchy they're very not great, but I think mommy looks pretty good and I think I

02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:31.580
Think if I can get her like

02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:34.940
Kind of greenish

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:48.020
These will look pretty decent as well. There you go

02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:57.620
Well, I'm not the greatest artist or at least I'm not taking my time with this because I

02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:00.460
I am like going boom

02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:04.340
From from

02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:12.660
Accelerate go make sure these designs are in

02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:21.860
So yeah, I think that's a very cute very

02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:26.900
Gamer girl. Yeah, we got

02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:46.700
And now for for the lady the lady

02:15:57.180 --> 02:16:00.980
We got two more left who's the two I got one more left

02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:10.260
You know, I'm only doing my gen mates. I'm only doing my gen mates. I

02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:16.100
Feel bad

02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:22.940
No mercy outfit no mercy outfits, Holly

02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:31.260
If you don't have a date idea for yourself, I figured six might be too much five might be doable

02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:35.220
So I was like screw it my gen mates come first

02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:41.540
Get it

02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:45.820
My gen mates come first

02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:51.540
Oh, I want a nice date outfit with our coal high

02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:03.540
My

02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:18.740
Outfit I really wanted like a sweater dress with like some ribbons on the side

02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:21.580
But I was also like

02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:26.420
Nope. Nope my girls first my gen mates are the most important

02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:35.140
I'm sorry, I don't have super chats yet

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:46.940
We I think monetization is happening very soon, but not quite now

02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:52.060
Sweater dress with ribbons, I think it was very romantic

02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:58.940
Honestly in my mind. I was like, oh, you know, we're gonna date. I'll curl my hair for Senpai

02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:05.900
I thought it was cute the idea to me was cute

02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:19.700
Soon but not there yet

02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:28.220
So yeah she be

02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:30.940
I have a question for my senpai's

02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:39.660
Big floppy hat or sunglasses because I want her to either have

02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:45.720
Like she's going to be a lady boss lady, but a lady the big

02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:48.980
Big floppy hat

02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:53.860
Yeah, the big hat both both. Okay, I can do I can do both too, maybe

02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:57.180
But we'll just do the design sketch first

02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:00.940
Just a whoops

02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:18.780
Little flourish here

02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:22.580
Mm-hmm

02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:29.620
We can do like the sunglasses here as well. She doesn't want to even look at you or she doesn't want you to look her in the eye

02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:31.620
That's how

02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:39.780
That's how she is I think her I think the pointed kind of like

02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:43.100
Yeah

02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:49.380
Kind of like the pointed sunnies would do fine

02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:54.620
She is a lady

02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:57.780
She is a lady and you will treat her as such

02:19:59.700 --> 02:20:06.500
She will allow you to look into her eyes only when when you deserve it trash

02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:23.500
It's a little off-sided

02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:31.380
No, we're not doing

02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:44.820
Can't do it. No big floppy hats have always been a sign of a lady. Okay of a lady

02:20:44.820 --> 02:20:47.300
I still want she'd be to be business

02:20:56.180 --> 02:20:59.660
So I had an idea where it was like

02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:05.740
Look at this like beautiful pencil type skirt. It's like it's like

02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.940
Stripes on it. It would be like so hot

02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:17.540
It would be so hot to have like her pencil skirt in a color that she's not normally

02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:21.100
In

02:21:22.900 --> 02:21:24.900
And

02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:36.780
Just for business cuz she would very much be all for business

02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:45.540
The trench coat dress

02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:51.140
This is called a peplum

02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:55.020
So be a peplum is kind of like it sticks out like this and

02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:58.180
Making it looks like a very mermaid look

02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:01.820
To it she's still very business

02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:07.540
But this time

02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:11.260
It's more

02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:15.820
And I want her to have like a little bit of like shoulder

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:18.260
Shoulder

02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:23.700
Yeah

02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:30.380
Under short or just like a bra or current honestly

02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:35.540
I'm just giving it a thought and I'm kind of like

02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:41.740
Would it be bad if like it's just the the the like deep

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:46.540
Uh deep drop trench coat with nothing underneath

02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:08.100
What's underneath who knows she won't tell you and you won't get to see it, but you can use your imagination

02:23:11.740 --> 02:23:13.740
And

02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:36.900
Then of course the madam will have

02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:43.900
Very nice little pantyholes

02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:01.660
And the pantyholes

02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:09.740
Only goes there why because it's one of those gartered pantyholes

02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:11.900
Oh

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:32.300
Sorry, excuse me

02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:34.300
I

02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:40.820
Need to think of shoes give me a second as I like Google some shoes

02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:42.820
For

02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:02.660
Pantyholes stockings leggings are a different type of garments. Yep, sure are

02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:10.300
Okay, I kind of like this

02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:15.820
Okay

02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:28.100
Let's start with black because I think that's what she would wear

02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:34.660
I

02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:52.820
Said sort of it wasn't you know what that was a lie that was a lie

02:26:02.660 --> 02:26:04.660
I

02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:27.380
Ignore my my very rushed bad art sort of it's fine. There you go

02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:35.500
He's a me Azra. Hello Azra. I am designing everyone's outfits. I'm sorry

02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:37.500
I made yours

02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:45.700
Bate solely based off of the fact that I want you to wear like a turtleneck sleeveless sweater

02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:55.620
And jeans and like the top here and might not be good might be hard to see but it's like a chiffon

02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:59.700
Button-up shirt. So you it gives you that like extra sexy look

02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:04.140
Well, I'll come to the stream

02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:09.260
But yeah, I'm designing everyone's outfits

02:27:13.780 --> 02:27:21.380
But yeah, I was like, uh-huh Azra needs us a turtleneck a sleeveless turtleneck

02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:24.700
I can't do it. I'm coming at the thought

02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:30.320
Strongie is like e-girl cuz she's playing lots of games

02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:42.740
For I see I was like, yes, she has to be like, you know a raving princess and then

02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:46.120
In me was like the goth

02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:50.980
The goth little sister goth emo little sister

02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:58.100
She can get whatever but she's also like, you know, she's ready. She's ready to stomp on someone

02:27:58.100 --> 02:28:06.140
And then now we're work on Chibi who I'm just going to be like she's a lady business lady means business

02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:13.980
Yeah, oh by the way, if anyone asks why does she be

02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:18.340
Have like not her regular boobs because everyone's body

02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:21.860
Is my body including the canoes

02:28:23.940 --> 02:28:28.900
The only one who's has their body as a normal body is

02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:47.180
Otherwise everyone else is me

02:28:48.580 --> 02:28:50.580
I

02:28:50.900 --> 02:29:00.780
So these are the designs I have so far I feel like Azra if I had time or if I had the ability right now I

02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:06.740
Would

02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:12.980
Put you in a ponytail. I would put you in a very long pony tail. I think that would be like hot

02:29:14.140 --> 02:29:15.900
I

02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:17.900
Think that would be hot

02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:27.740
Like why is I see it looks smaller well, I put her in a platform

02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:37.980
Choose and well she only looks shorter because it's pulled down a little bit

02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:43.080
You like I love I love not the dead mom ponytail

02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:49.800
Shut up. No, it's like the high ponytail where it would be like super cute. It'll be like a scrunchie

02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:52.360
She's like mom, you know, she's ready to go

02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:56.040
Go by groceries right after her after your date

02:29:57.240 --> 02:29:59.240
There's the mercy drawing

02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:02.600
I

02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:10.840
Decided not to do the mercy drawing because I thought I would probably be wearing myself thin by that point. I

02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:14.320
Think I would be wearing myself thin

02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:28.520
Yeah, I would be I would be wearing myself thin if I did six so I'm just like five it is

02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:31.080
My girls get to come first

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.600
So they they they get to

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:52.560
You could have done one pick space just for you to cook

02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:58.520
I'm already tired to be honest doing four outfits already. I'm already tired

02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:06.440
I'm already tired and whole whole wee-wee you have me

02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:10.920
I'm the star of this child

02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:30.400
So yeah five is a lot and as much as I love my girls as much as I love to design an outfit for me

02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:32.840
I just don't have the time or the energy

02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:42.200
And I don't want to like, you know, I don't want to what do you call it? I don't want to

02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:49.720
Overshadow or make mine like particularly more interesting or anything

02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:54.520
I've just had like these designs in my mind for a while

02:31:57.960 --> 02:32:03.240
I've always had these designs in them in my mind for a while. Honestly my personal favorite

02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:06.200
Is all of them I

02:32:10.040 --> 02:32:12.000
Think my maze is pretty good, too

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.640
I know it's super simple and I know as her as is pretty simple, too

02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:22.440
But I think they're they're pretty good. Honestly if I yeah, I would say they're pretty good

02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:31.760
I think they're pretty good honestly, I think

02:32:32.720 --> 02:32:34.720
They're all pretty good. I think

02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:37.120
you know like

02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:41.520
I see like a raver princess, and I think it's very good and then

02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:45.280
It means being like kind of like a

02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:50.680
Simpler outfit makes her look more mature, but like her pertinence makes her look

02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:55.080
Still like a little sister. So I was like, yeah, this is great. I

02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:57.080
Think

02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:03.640
They all suit suit and I think

02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:09.560
If they were to wear this out in the day, it would not impede them in any way

02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:16.440
I think it would still like, you know, and me would still have all her like

02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:22.000
Magic magic books and stuff in her backpack and so it wouldn't impede her

02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:31.040
Ignore the fact that I see has hands. It's her paws and imagine her paws there

02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:40.760
Hers would allow her to move quite quickly and if she needed to like fight someone she would but also will help her

02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:43.760
I'll make her dance easy and

02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:53.000
And I'll make her dance and then she could spend a lot of time doing her DJing

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.080
Wait, is she be meant to be transparent? No, I just sketched it out

02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:03.800
I just sketched it out so far so that I can get her so I can like put in the colors in soon

02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:09.720
I just worked on the shoes and then mom made such a gamer. She's been gaming for like hours, right?

02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:11.920
So I figured that like, you know an e-girl outfit

02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:17.320
Based off of the reeflings would be like really cute and then of course Azra

02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:22.160
I feel like, you know, she'll go on a date with you, but she's got to do some groceries and some toys

02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:25.160
And you do you want to go with her? Of course you do

02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:34.040
You know, I think those are these are like

02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:38.720
Based off of like what I feel about them

02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:44.360
So right now I have I'm working on Chibi's right now

02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:48.520
I wanted her to have sunglasses and a big hat because why

02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:56.760
She wants to be under a shade, you know, she just wants to be beautiful. She wants to be beautiful and

02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:02.480
Under the shade and not under the same sun as you

02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:11.160
Where will she keep the crop who knows it's magic. All right, I'm heading out to bed to sleep

02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:16.720
Sleep. I'm so sleepy. Okay, Azra. Have good sleep. I kiss you and tuck you in

02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:23.040
So right now I'm working on Chibi's outfit

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:29.160
I still think I still think they're all fairly good even if they're super sketchy even if they're super sketchy

02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:31.160
and I don't have time to

02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:35.880
To like block them in and make them look way better

02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:42.360
So yeah, this is what you get I

02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:45.520
Think they're cute. I

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.200
Can definitely do better, but I think they're cute for now

02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:08.640
For Chibi's outfit, I think to match her hair. I think it should be kind of like a

02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:15.720
Like a bit of a off-white tan ish color

02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:25.520
So the outfit I have in mind for Chibi is very business a very business-looking and

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:29.040
She would be wearing

02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:34.640
I'm forgetting words now

02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:40.640
Oh

02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:48.760
Stretchy oh

02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:57.000
Can you tell that I'm getting tired, but I don't want to like do like a bad job on Chibi's so

02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:05.400
So yeah, it's a peplum peplum trench trench coat look nothing underneath by the way

02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:11.160
Uh with a pencil skirt that kind of reveals the

02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:18.300
Kind of reveals her like I because the

02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:22.880
The stockings are

02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:29.160
Just said it

02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:31.240
Um

02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:34.760
Are like gartered gartered on

02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:47.360
So that's why I'm just like, okay, we'll have this look and she will have a very big

02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:52.160
beautiful hat so that she can um just

02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.200
relax and

02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:00.000
Have a good time

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:13.560
He gets to stay out of the sun with the big hat

02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:18.480
Honestly, if I had a choice, I'll be like yeah out of cane

02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:25.320
Out of cane too, but I'm just like the implications of that might be not that great

02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:32.120
Relaxing but still girl bossing as I you know, that's Chibi

02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:50.480
Just

02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:58.960
Ignore the fact that my shading is terrible right now. I'm like what am I doing?

02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:03.400
I'm already getting that point where I'm just like I feel kind of delirious

02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:06.200
I feel kind of delirious

02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:17.080
It's a lot of brainpower to do design if it's just going with the flow with the story

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:22.560
It's cool, too, but I'm just I'm so tired

02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:25.160
I

02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:30.600
Don't want to do a bad job because I've had this idea in my mind for a while or for Chibi as well

02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:40.080
I wanted I wanted to at least look like

02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:43.680
There was thought put into this

02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:50.480
I

02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:10.280
Trench like I've got I'm going for a trench coat look as well

02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:18.240
So I think she be look fantastic

02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:21.480
And a trench coat

02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:27.720
But like underneath I know there's like a bra there, but underneath she would not be wearing anything

02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:34.620
Just saying she would not be wearing anything it would just be skin

02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:43.400
What does she have under there I don't know it's up to your imagination, but she won't let you know

02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:47.040
She won't let you know

02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:50.480
I

02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:02.640
Block these in already have the idea in my mind, so I think we can just block these in

02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:15.800
So that it's a bit more square up here, so I can give it I kind of like boss shoulder pad lady look

02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:25.440
The Mercy know what's underneath. I don't know what's underneath. It's up to my imagination as well as your Senpai

02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:45.440
I know some people it's hard to see what I'm visioning because I this is this is completely a sketch. This is like

02:41:46.440 --> 02:41:54.760
Sketch sketch form and just blocking in the colors and kind of getting the idea out there rather than like formally

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:02.040
Like rendering it out into something like super amazing and stuff so

02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:07.520
This is just ideas ideas must come out now

02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:13.760
Ideas will come out now and they cannot be stopped

02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:17.440
I

02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:27.520
Like a blazer jacket yes

02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:35.560
But it's peplum a peplum is when it's I kind of like sticks out there at the end going like a skirt like a skirt

02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:41.640
So I've always liked that look it gives it such a mermaid, but also very elegant look to it

02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:43.760
My opinion

02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:03.600
It gives it like that very elegant look and I think it's simple but effective I

02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:08.960
Know it's gonna look really funny without without like the line to show it off

02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:11.960
So just give me a second

02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:23.400
Well, give me a second. I gotta fill in these as well. So

02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:33.000
I've always had these like ideas maybe I'll add another one have these ideas for like she

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Without it for a while

02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:39.640
Nah, she was good

02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:45.400
Yeah, she looks better

02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:53.360
Okay, let's draw in the details

02:43:57.600 --> 02:44:02.400
Just so everyone can see my own vision as well

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.120
Ignore the fact that she has so much thighs. It's cuz like, you know, this is my body

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:38.320
She we have less thighs, I think it's just not

02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:50.640
The I think the the the torso ratio to thigh is like not as extreme in my opinion

02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:01.860
Wait, I don't like that hold on let me redo this

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Different pencil

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
The different

02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:30.840
Actually let's

02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.360
My re kind of redesign reconceptualize the occult

02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:41.240
I like it

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
This

02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:48.640
Getting some

02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:11.840
There we go. Yes, that looks better

02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:32.840
Oh

02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:59.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there we go

02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:03.280
And then

02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:15.920
Her her bobs are big but my bobs are not so

02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:21.080
Pretend out pretend that is her bobs

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:26.240
Just redraw over it

02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:28.240
Yeah

02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:31.240
Yeah

02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:52.840
There we go

02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:04.200
Yeah, you know what forget it. Okay, forget it. It's even in your mind

02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:18.600
Now that someone said like the curious George guy, I'm starting to be like, oh, maybe I should change

02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:34.440
Something what the heck now you're making me feel bad

02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:42.120
No, I can't even see it either fuck you

02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:44.120
I

02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:58.160
Was going for like a cream kind of like a trench coat color because of her because of the

02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:06.440
Because of the I

02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:11.920
I like I liked that it would look probably nice with her hair

02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:22.320
Oh my recolor is I work so hard on this too

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:38.440
Oh

02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:09.440
I

02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:18.640
Cream you're good, but now I can't see it. I can't unsee it. Maybe I should just like block it in with like black instead

02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:32.320
Like black instead I thought cream would look good with her with her with her hair

02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:38.440
I

02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:58.720
Color this in

02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:01.320
I

02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:07.480
Maybe black skirt for ballot

02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:15.600
Looks oh the racer came on

02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:26.960
Yeah, we'll just make her skirt black and then maybe it will it will make make it look less

02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:29.400
Like the man

02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:45.840
Problem code, sorry, I have problem code to make it look nice

02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:47.840
Oh

02:51:54.600 --> 02:52:00.400
Let me get like this I can color in

02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:11.080
This so be like no bubba's no no

02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:17.680
There imagine it nothing underneath. Yep

02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:19.680
Oh

02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:41.720
There

02:52:48.680 --> 02:52:50.680
You know

02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:53.720
It might look pretty decent with the

02:52:55.520 --> 02:52:58.600
Yeah, I think it looks decent with the the black skirt

02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:02.840
And then we're just

02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:08.400
Designer sunglasses

02:53:12.200 --> 02:53:14.200
She doesn't want to look at you

02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:20.280
I

02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:38.360
That in some

02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:49.640
Color blocks. Yeah

02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:56.280
Let's do some color blocks

02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:10.360
I

02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:23.980
Lock it look it I'm gonna go extra I'm gonna go extra

02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:36.040
Her first shawl a first shawl

02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:40.360
I

02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:49.640
Was like I'm not sure about this idea now. I'm locked in screw it

02:54:57.240 --> 02:54:59.240
What do you think

02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:06.720
The first date she would come out with this first shawl and should be like bark for me

02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:10.360
Oh

02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:31.720
If she doesn't like the date she walks away she walks away with her bodyguard saying saying

02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:39.840
Saying ban him from from I don't know ban him from from my establishment

02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:52.760
I think she be would definitely be like don't look at me

02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:00.880
You don't have the right to do that type of look

02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:04.400
You

02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:12.640
Think she'll say anything at all. Maybe she'll just look at you and just really give you a disgusted face

02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:25.760
That's what I envisioned for she be because I was like, oh, yeah, she's business lady and she means business even on her dates

02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:28.080
Oh

02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:37.840
She'll be so business even on her dates. Oh, oh, I'm exhausted now

02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:50.720
I'm exhausted now. Maybe it's maybe I'm just like oh, it's not enough here. Let's make a shawl a little bit longer

02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:58.060
Oh

02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:08.300
Exhausted I think everyone's outfits pretty frickin nice

02:57:10.840 --> 02:57:14.040
Honestly, I think everyone's outfits pretty nice simple

02:57:16.040 --> 02:57:18.040
And would

02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:22.160
Would

02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:24.200
Be realistically in

02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:29.640
their in their kind of

02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:35.480
Domain of what they do and that they would

02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:44.480
They would

02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:54.520
Sorry they're in line and what they would do in a comfortable way in which

02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:01.320
Which the girls will also be able to work and shine in their best environment

02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:04.760
so

02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:10.600
So for

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:13.080
Azra, it's a very mommy look

02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:20.800
Going out shopping grocery shopping. I would give her a very high ponytail. So hold on. Let me get

02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:23.680
her color

02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:29.160
I'll put her in a very high ponytail. So ignore that. This is gonna be super sketchy, but

02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:32.760
Well

02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:35.600
It'll be like

02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:41.240
Super high up that it would ask a down

02:58:45.280 --> 02:58:48.200
I'm so bad at this. I can't tell distance

02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:50.800
I

02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:54.520
Just

02:58:54.800 --> 02:58:59.800
Hi ponytail probably in a scrunchie and I'll be like, you know

02:59:01.760 --> 02:59:08.120
I'll be it be down here, but then it'll probably like, you know an Azra style

02:59:09.080 --> 02:59:11.080
cascade down

02:59:13.880 --> 02:59:15.880
Stronnies is an e-girl

02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:25.320
It's an e-girl she'll play games for hours and hours probably be at home stepping on her little

02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:28.400
reef link slippers

02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:33.040
I

02:59:33.080 --> 02:59:35.080
See would be the princess

02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:37.400
the

02:59:37.400 --> 02:59:39.040
raving princess

02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:45.880
So it will be enough for her to DJ and she'll go to raves and she'll have her little like

02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:52.880
Binky binky necklace like diamond binky necklace

02:59:56.400 --> 02:59:58.400
And then

03:00:03.040 --> 03:00:12.280
In me would be would be like, you know, like, uh-huh cute cute emo goth goth girlfriend little sister

03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:14.760
What

03:00:15.600 --> 03:00:21.800
Strawneys casual hairdo, I think it would just be like a lobe. I think it would just be like it would just hang down

03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:27.720
I think her her her casual hair would just hang down. Maybe a little bit unkempt, you know

03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:33.800
This French outfit kind of fire. Yeah, I think so

03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:36.520
I

03:00:42.040 --> 03:00:44.040
Unkempt from gaming all night. Yeah

03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:50.560
What about your safer work outfit? I've decided to not do my own outfit because

03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:54.240
Five is already exhausting and I was like, oh

03:00:55.600 --> 03:01:00.680
Maybe none for me. Maybe none for me. I think that the girl should come first

03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:06.440
Yeah, I think I'll be a little little unkempt

03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:14.480
Strawneys hair would be unkempt just from gaming, but I think it's still really cute in this e-girl outfit for her like two bunches

03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:17.680
Pig tails. I think that's cute. I

03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:22.000
Think that's cute when it's like the two bunches

03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:26.680
Describe your date outfit. I wanted like a sweater dress with ribbons

03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:35.800
I

03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:41.280
Wanted a sweater dress with ribbons on them

03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:45.640
That one's cute and that would be a cute idea

03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:49.240
And

03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:52.840
Like in my mind, I was like, oh, I want to impress my senpai

03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:58.920
So I'm gonna curl my hair and leave it down a little bit and put like ribbons in my hair as well

03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:02.320
That's my thought

03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:10.640
Hahaha and a mustache the mustache is only for an artistic endeavors

03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:17.800
About the footwear, um

03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:24.560
Mary Jane's Mary Jane's maybe something cute

03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:29.320
Maybe loafers, I don't know I

03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:32.320
I

03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:34.320
Divergent killer sweater. No more like

03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:40.080
Kind of the off-the-shoulder sweater, you know those types

03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:49.880
Those types of sweaters I think are would have been my my taste

03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:52.880
I

03:02:54.640 --> 03:03:02.000
Yeah, I'm proud I'm proud of what I did. It's not like super artistic and not like super rendered fully

03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:09.440
But I think that it gives you the idea of what I wanted to do for

03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:13.280
The girls

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
So you kind of get the idea

03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:22.160
The

03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:33.320
Idea of what I was going for I'm kind of I wanted Emmys little hair bunches to like go on the side of her head instead

03:03:33.320 --> 03:03:35.320
So it'd be like cute

03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:42.840
So that's why I had the arrow pointing up because I was like, I can't figure out how to do this without it looking bad

03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:49.360
So yeah, you can see the vision and that's all that matters

03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:51.880
Yeah

03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:00.200
And I'm kind of

03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:05.400
I'm kind of proud of it. I feel like oh, I'm like them. I've been debating on like I

03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:08.280
Think it just doesn't

03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:15.120
Shibby's outfit is like, huh, maybe if I'd get do it like not this cream color, but maybe like a

03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:20.640
Different color, maybe it may be a look better in all black. I'm like debating on like that

03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:24.520
I'm like debating on the color

03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:33.320
And definitely if this was on Shibby's actual body, it would fit her way better. It's just me. It's just my body

03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:40.640
I don't think my body would look looks as good as in pencil skirt simply because

03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:47.160
My hips are the hip till like waist ratio does not make it look that great

03:04:59.920 --> 03:05:02.440
But I think on Shibby's like body body

03:05:03.480 --> 03:05:10.120
Would look much better because I I envisioned this with their actual bodies and then when the time came I was like

03:05:10.760 --> 03:05:12.760
Everybody gets my body

03:05:13.960 --> 03:05:15.960
Everyone gets mine

03:05:18.160 --> 03:05:20.160
It's all mercy except for Azra

03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:32.640
It's all me even the canoes they're all me

03:05:40.640 --> 03:05:42.640
I

03:05:49.320 --> 03:05:51.320
Didn't have time to like

03:05:51.920 --> 03:05:58.920
Do their whole with their bodies. I was like, it's just me and then Azra and then me with no boobs are the canoes

03:06:03.480 --> 03:06:05.480
So tired

03:06:06.240 --> 03:06:08.240
I

03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:17.400
So tired now some pie. I think this is gotta be it. There's gotta be it. I know it's not the greatest

03:06:17.400 --> 03:06:21.640
I just wanted to like bam bam get the idea out there right now

03:06:23.720 --> 03:06:32.760
Well tea time go hi today's tea is gingerbread today's word it's frazzled

03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:45.360
So I think yeah get the idea out there and then just blow yeah

03:06:51.320 --> 03:06:54.200
Now I'm debating on like Shibby's outfit, I'm just like

03:06:54.560 --> 03:06:56.560
I

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:06.960
Know that lay they look really rough. I know that they look really rough, but I'm just like nah

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:14.000
We we we we ball in here and plus I got I've got I have to admit that I have quite a

03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:22.600
Background and fashion and design like not in an educational sense

03:07:22.600 --> 03:07:30.120
But as a hobbyist sense. Oh, wait, no, no, no my my lore is I am a design student

03:07:30.120 --> 03:07:34.360
I was a design student never mind. Yes, I have it in an educational sense

03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:44.320
Mercy what time is it for you? Well, I can tell you it's the next day

03:07:44.320 --> 03:07:53.680
It's the next day Senpai

03:07:58.320 --> 03:07:59.440
Okay

03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:08.200
Take a screenshot if any of my wonderful Senpais wanted to like redraw or do like arts of

03:08:09.240 --> 03:08:12.900
The girls in these outfits you may do it

03:08:14.520 --> 03:08:16.520
I

03:08:22.200 --> 03:08:28.600
Always had an interest in fashion for a long time actually one of my dreams when I was like a kid was like fashion designer

03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:39.600
That's fine

03:08:40.600 --> 03:08:42.600
So

03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:50.080
Yeah, if anyone wants to draw my gen mates outfits you may I think it look it would look great

03:08:50.080 --> 03:08:55.840
I think if you conceptualize it better than I I just go like bam bam bam. Thank you ma'am

03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:03.040
Yeah

03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:09.600
You you're free to draw me anytime as well, but I I feel like in relation to the stream

03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:21.040
Well, yeah, blow this pic to the twit Twitter, do you guys think I should

03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:28.680
You guys think I should Senpai's think I should

03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:30.800
Hmm

03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:39.360
Okay, it's not the greatest but you know, it's enough for a stream and it's enough to get my ideas out there

03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:52.440
They had more time this would probably take a few like maybe a week a week to like fully conceptualize

03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:59.040
Shade in and everything and make it look good, but unfortunately we've only got three hours and three hours is enough for

03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:03.960
Sketches

03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:09.200
Sketches concept art

03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:18.720
Oh, yeah, thank you everyone for joining me today. Oh, let's see what's on my schedule

03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:24.440
I

03:10:29.280 --> 03:10:34.080
Think this week, there's only two more streams left. I think

03:10:35.720 --> 03:10:43.360
Tomorrow is harvester. Oh, how exciting I really want to play a harvester. What about the meat Senpai?

03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:45.640
Wait, no, it's not the meat the meat

03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:48.240
And

03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:54.840

03:10:54.840 --> 03:10:59.960
Oh, yeah, I wanted to say because I check finally checked my schedule

03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:10.480
Uh, I've checked my schedule. I do have a Q&A

03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:13.960

from a complete not professional and

03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:33.840
It might be good advice. It might be terrible advice. Who knows?

03:11:38.560 --> 03:11:40.560
Mustache gone

03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:50.520

03:11:52.920 --> 03:12:01.760
Mystery advice if you have any troubles feel free to ask mercy will help you

03:12:04.240 --> 03:12:09.880
What questions can we send in say for work questions. Thank you. It's a stream after all, please do some say for work questions

03:12:09.880 --> 03:12:11.880
I don't know like

03:12:12.840 --> 03:12:18.280
You can ask things like like I I want to go I want to go to

03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:21.600
I

03:12:21.600 --> 03:12:27.000
Have two events. I booked up and I want to go to this one or this one. Which do I choose?

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
You know those types of questions

03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:40.960
You can ask me for investment advice is just that I guarantee you will be a bad advice

03:12:42.880 --> 03:12:45.840
Or if you're like, I've been feeling sad lately

03:12:45.840 --> 03:12:52.400
What should I do about it? And then maybe I can give you a little bit of advice about things that I would do and you know, yeah

03:12:57.040 --> 03:12:59.400
No, not those type of questions silly

03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:07.920
Mildly not safe for work as long as it can be put on stream

03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:10.360
Then it's safe

03:13:10.360 --> 03:13:12.840
Just remember that big brother

03:13:16.560 --> 03:13:20.240
Big brother not not it means big bro big brother

03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:25.680
YouTube who is always watching keeping a watch roll eye on all of us and fortunately

03:13:26.960 --> 03:13:28.960
Smiting us when they can

03:13:29.960 --> 03:13:31.960
Uh

03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:43.960
Approved so please keep that in mind. We are we are as in we as in be a lore is

03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:51.080
Is

03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:54.280
Applying for monetization so keep that in mind

03:13:54.360 --> 03:14:00.160
Okay, okay

03:14:06.920 --> 03:14:13.280
So, yeah, if anything that causes me to get in trouble that's not good at all

03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:20.680
If you ask the most sussiest nonniest questions, they will simply be ignored

03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:25.080
They will simply be ignored and not appear on stream

03:14:31.480 --> 03:14:37.120
So that's all I'm very close to monetization so

03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:42.620
Hopefully within like the next few days it will properly count

03:14:44.600 --> 03:14:46.280
Properly come

03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:48.280
Get to it and then

03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:50.960
As they're reviewing content perhaps

03:14:51.920 --> 03:14:53.920
Perhaps I was safe

03:14:54.440 --> 03:15:00.480
Perhaps I am safe enough for work and that I will continue being safe for work and

03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:05.000
Forever ever never do sassy things ever

03:15:06.520 --> 03:15:11.400
I will continue doing those types of thing and only doing

03:15:13.080 --> 03:15:16.000
Bad things off of the platform as it is not

03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:20.080
representative of the YouTube of the YouTube brand

03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:35.200
We will be very safe from forever, yes forever

03:15:37.400 --> 03:15:39.400
We

03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:53.180
We stay TOS compliant every time and we will be a great great asset to the

03:16:03.520 --> 03:16:11.080
Making sure that all users are safe on YouTube and not at all

03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000
Anything else

03:16:16.320 --> 03:16:18.320
Oh

03:16:27.800 --> 03:16:31.280
With that Senpai I have I went through all the things

03:16:32.520 --> 03:16:37.440
I'm gonna let you go now back into the cage

03:16:46.400 --> 03:16:53.880
I'm gonna let you all back into the cage to get some rest for the next day and then we'll play harvester tomorrow. I

03:16:54.640 --> 03:16:58.080
Love point and click so hopefully we'll have lots of fun with that. I

03:16:58.720 --> 03:17:01.600
Don't mind a little a little bit of back seating when I ask

03:17:02.480 --> 03:17:04.480
So yeah, I hope

03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:10.280
That you all have a wonderful time have lots of rest and

03:17:10.840 --> 03:17:14.600
Take care of yourself also do your homework and watch

03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:18.040
