32:48.240 --> 32:51.720
Usually the issue is with my my ISP

32:53.120 --> 32:55.120
My ISP so it's not usually

33:01.040 --> 33:02.640
So yeah

33:02.640 --> 33:08.360
My parents are very sweet people. I love them very much and that's why I really want to be successful

33:08.600 --> 33:12.960
So that I can provide for them, but also I kind of want to move out because

33:14.440 --> 33:16.760
Well, you know

33:18.000 --> 33:23.920
You don't really a lot of privacy when living with your parents because my time is always their time

33:26.280 --> 33:30.040
So any time I tell them okay, I'm at work right now

33:30.840 --> 33:38.360
I'm at work right now, so I can't I can't do I can't do things until maybe like until I'm done, okay?

33:39.360 --> 33:44.240
They don't normally get that and sometimes will interrupt and be like

33:48.640 --> 33:55.320
And so I'm just like, okay, okay, we go

33:59.800 --> 34:01.800
Honestly, they don't want me to move

34:02.400 --> 34:07.640
I've been telling them like oh, yeah, I'm thinking about moving and they're like no no no no no no no no no

34:08.360 --> 34:11.040
No, don't move. We need you

34:18.440 --> 34:20.440
No, please don't move

34:21.240 --> 34:28.680
It's so funny because um, oh my gosh, I'm so I'm I'm yapping. I'm yapping. I haven't even played the game

34:30.720 --> 34:33.320
I haven't even played. I'm so sorry. I'm still yapping

34:35.880 --> 34:42.320
When when okay, here's a fun fact about about me senpai's I worked I worked in Japan

34:42.320 --> 34:44.440
I didn't at an internship or

34:44.680 --> 34:51.800
Or um for about three months. Mm-hmm. So I lived in Japan for three months and um

34:55.880 --> 35:02.440
And um, I was like, oh, yeah, you know, if I get a job offer here, I'll stay and

35:03.800 --> 35:08.200
Mama and Papa were like if you're moving to Japan, we are moving to Japan

35:14.520 --> 35:16.520
Oh

35:31.080 --> 35:37.800
But I really want to want my privacy because um for patreon and stuff I have to go into like a pretty much, um

35:38.600 --> 35:46.120
Uh really a secluded room with like, uh, I put like a bunch of clothing around to to soundproof it a bit

35:47.320 --> 35:49.880
It's not ideal. It's not an ideal situation

35:53.800 --> 35:56.280
Yeah closet it's pretty much a closet recording

35:57.400 --> 36:04.760
So I would really love to like one of my goals is to like move out so that I'll be able to have a space to work

36:08.680 --> 36:10.680
Yeah

36:15.160 --> 36:20.920
So I'm I'm trying to convince them that if I do move out, I'll I'll I'll move out

36:21.000 --> 36:23.640
But I'll be I'll be really close to help them out

36:31.160 --> 36:34.120
So all of my audios have been kind of like in a closet. Yeah

36:38.520 --> 36:40.520
So don't worry about it

36:41.560 --> 36:45.160
It's a little awkward. Yeah, I think I feel like it's a little awkward, but

36:46.520 --> 36:48.200
um

36:48.200 --> 36:50.840
I am bringing in some money so

36:51.720 --> 36:57.000
So they'll be happy and as long as I'm able to pay pay off the bills and stuff

36:57.080 --> 36:59.000
I think though they're pretty happy about that

36:59.960 --> 37:01.960
like, um

37:02.200 --> 37:04.200
For a little bit I have to ask

37:04.200 --> 37:06.200
uh, I used to be the one

37:06.280 --> 37:12.040
to pay for like gas and electricity and like utilities, but then I

37:13.480 --> 37:16.200
I couldn't find a job so

37:17.720 --> 37:19.720
So I um

37:22.360 --> 37:25.160
I um, I yeah, I la

37:26.520 --> 37:30.040
I had to ask them and they were so worried about about it

37:30.040 --> 37:32.040
Um

37:33.640 --> 37:36.680
Did your sister escape the raft? Oh, yeah

37:38.120 --> 37:40.120
Oh, yeah, she oh, yeah, she did

37:41.080 --> 37:42.600
the moment

37:42.600 --> 37:44.040
um

37:44.040 --> 37:45.880
the moment

37:45.880 --> 37:47.320
she

37:47.320 --> 37:49.080
Could get out

37:49.080 --> 37:51.160
Uh, she was like, okay. I'm sending abroad

37:51.880 --> 37:53.560
Bye

37:53.560 --> 37:55.560
And she just left

37:56.520 --> 38:02.680
No, my sister's not single. She's married trying to trying to I think she's trying to adopt

38:04.840 --> 38:10.280
Uh adopt adopt and then I'm I was the one that was like, okay, you're stuck now

38:14.120 --> 38:16.120
It was really um

38:16.760 --> 38:19.720
It was really tough the job market here is pretty tough

38:19.800 --> 38:23.480
Like I tried to apply to to mcdonald's and they didn't even accept me

38:23.560 --> 38:26.600
Well, mostly because they wanted the morning shift and I'm allergic to eggs

38:26.600 --> 38:29.000
So they didn't want to bear the responsibility for that either

38:29.480 --> 38:33.400
But like a lot of places like they just they were like no we have

38:34.200 --> 38:39.960
like uh here it's such a job desert that I think even the most basic, uh

38:41.000 --> 38:47.240
Customer service job has over us the average here is 700

38:47.960 --> 38:49.960
Uh applicants per job

38:50.920 --> 38:52.920
No matter what it is

38:54.360 --> 38:56.360
You

39:00.600 --> 39:03.960
So it's uh, it's hard it's been hard here

39:12.600 --> 39:14.600
So it's it's not easy

39:17.640 --> 39:21.720
Um, honestly, uh to be honest before I got the

39:22.680 --> 39:24.680
The email for

39:25.560 --> 39:27.560
VLR

39:27.720 --> 39:28.840
I

39:28.840 --> 39:32.920
Was in line for seven hours seven hours at a job there

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
It was it was harsh

39:40.200 --> 39:42.200
It was harsh. It was really harsh

39:42.760 --> 39:53.000
No way my sister is uh, it's fine something about my sister

39:59.000 --> 40:06.040
But yeah, I was so glad when I got the the call I was like, oh my gosh finally I can I can I can start providing again

40:12.760 --> 40:21.720

I would love

40:51.160 --> 40:53.160

A bit of privacy, um

41:07.480 --> 41:10.120

54:37.640 --> 54:41.480
Okay, let's try this and then we'll pull it down

54:47.400 --> 54:50.840

Did a driver issue? I don't think so

55:39.480 --> 55:41.480
Okay, looks normal

56:09.400 --> 56:11.400
We'll keep an eye on it

56:12.680 --> 56:14.680
I don't know why it's doing this though

56:15.960 --> 56:21.000
Um, the reason why I'm confused about why it's doing this is because it's never done this before

56:23.160 --> 56:26.360
I'm gonna swing to the moon. I tried to do that once

56:31.640 --> 56:35.880
Did the game crash before when I played it it never crashed like this before

56:36.600 --> 56:41.800
So I don't think and uh, I can't do a regular game capture because it's

56:43.800 --> 56:45.800
Chromium based

56:47.640 --> 56:51.000
So I would do a uh window capture instead

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
So, uh

56:53.240 --> 56:56.360
A window capture is that it captures a specific window

56:56.760 --> 57:01.400
Usually I do a window capture, especially if a game has like a specific cut scene

57:01.880 --> 57:06.120
Uh, because sometimes like uh, when you do a game capture a cut scene

57:06.760 --> 57:10.360
Uh has something in it, uh, that won't get captured

57:10.760 --> 57:16.600
But I am seeing right now that the uh game capture is flickering on in

57:17.240 --> 57:18.200
like

57:18.280 --> 57:23.480
A lot so I'm worried that it's it's going to be really weird because when it captures the screen

57:23.800 --> 57:28.520
There's a yellow border here. Hold on. I'll explain it. There's a yellow border around

57:29.320 --> 57:31.320
the uh the window

57:31.960 --> 57:33.960
if it's uh

57:36.760 --> 57:42.840
If it's capturing it but right now the yellow window like the yellow outlined is uh

57:43.000 --> 57:46.440
Uh flashing so it's making me worried

57:58.440 --> 58:01.640
So that's why I'm just like, hmm, are you gonna be okay?

58:03.720 --> 58:06.280
I wonder if it only happens if I go to this boss thing

58:07.720 --> 58:09.720
Now boss zone

58:10.520 --> 58:12.520
No, I think it's fine

58:13.560 --> 58:15.560
I think it's fine

58:15.720 --> 58:20.040
So that's why oh, yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. Let's check

58:22.040 --> 58:26.120
Early talk so fast when she's excited. It gets really hard to keep up

58:28.600 --> 58:32.440
Nose is my best friend. I can't say much but she's really smart

58:35.640 --> 58:37.640
Nose looks occupied

58:40.760 --> 58:42.760
I like puzzles

58:42.920 --> 58:44.920
I

58:45.160 --> 58:47.160
You'll I hate eggs

59:00.760 --> 59:08.200
Hey, I'm already guess what I got some plans today big plans. Just stay put for a while. You'll see what I mean soon enough

59:09.400 --> 59:11.400
Okay

59:12.280 --> 59:14.280
Okay, same thing

59:17.320 --> 59:21.160
I hate eggs. Hey, wait just one second. Where do you think you're going?

59:24.040 --> 59:29.560
Can't leave without joining us for a game of hide and seek stay and play with us the more the merrier

59:31.000 --> 59:34.200
You you want us you want to play hide and seek again?

59:34.920 --> 59:36.920
But

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
You know how this turned out last time

59:40.040 --> 59:42.040
Yeah, sorry barely

59:42.280 --> 59:44.280
I think we're gonna have to pass

59:45.000 --> 59:49.480
We're going we're going to basil's house now. So we'll catch up with you later

59:51.240 --> 59:54.280
Not so fast you guys are trying to avoid me again

59:54.520 --> 59:56.520
Oh

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.400
What's up with you two is it my face my rough and tough exterior

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:13.240
At least I'm not as bad as boss. It's a good thing. I banned him from the playground after what happened last time

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.600
Wonder what that marines up to now

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.200
Good riddance

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.480
So do you want to play hide and seek basil?

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.040
No, either way

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.040
There's no rush to get to my house after all

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.920
I think I'll leave it up to oh my

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.040
What do you want it to?

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.200
Oh my

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.840
Give me a second

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry my best friend. Come on. You know how to play hide and seek. Don't you?

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.360
What if I just say no

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.600
You don't know how to play hide and seek

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:16.360
What kind of kid are you anyway? That means you have to play with us. I'll explain the rules after I round up everyone

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.040
I was forced to do it anyways

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440
Tan hot

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.720
All right mega tears the rules

We're gonna be entertaining ourselves with a little game of hide and seek

Here in my hands. I got some straws see everyone's gotta pick a straw

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.840
The one with the shortest straw is gonna be it and we'll have to find everyone else

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.560
Sounds easy enough, right?

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.280
Oh

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.040

Come on, don't be babies. It ain't so bad amore will be fine

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:56.440
When you're ready to play walk up to the tether ball pole and close your eyes and no peeking or else

And suddenly

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.880

Probably should stir this

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.640

That's... that's strange.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.560
I thought I saw him go hiding near that tree over there.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.560
Basel, where are you?

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.560

Huh?

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.560
Hey, there's Basel.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.560
Basel, are you okay?

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.560

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.560
Boss, I sure didn't know it was you!

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.560
You're good for nothing scoundrel!

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.560
Let Basel go!

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.560
Yeah, what did Basel ever do to you?

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.560
Basel's our friend!

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.560
Don't you dare hurt him!

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.560
I called Basel, boss.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.560
He didn't do anything wrong.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.560
Whee!

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.560

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.560
You stupid heads!

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.560
You think this is about Basel?

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.560
I did a really cute voice for Boss.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.560
Don't play dumb!

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.560
You know why I'm here!

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.560
How dare you not invite me to hide and seek!

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.560
I'm the one who showed you all how to play in the first place!

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.560
You're not even playing here, right?

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.560
How can you call it hide and seek without any body slamming?

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.560
My flower crown!

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.560
Hey, that's the flower crown we made for Basel!

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.560
How could you?

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.560
Let go of him, you bully!

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.560
No!

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.560
If I can't play with everyone, then no one can!

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.560
This is a boss-only zone now!

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.560
And you're not invited!

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.560
Alright!

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.560
Where's my skill?

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.560
Sad follow-up!

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560
Sure.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.560
Oh, Aubrey do!

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.560
Skill.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.560
Peptoc.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.560
Here, let's do it for him.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.560
Oh, Cal-do.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.560
And no one.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.560
You saw him!

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.560
Never mind.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.560
Actually.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.560
Attack.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.560
Boss.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.560
Oh, Hero-do.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.560
No, Cook.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.560
Ah, just attack.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.560
Oh, Maury, you had a sad poem.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.560
Oh, Maury felt sad.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.560
Boss attacks.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560
You can do it, Aubrey!

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560
Cheers on Hero!

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.560
You feel happy!

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560
Hero attacks Boss.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.560
Take 15 damage.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.560
Oscar cracks his neck while Maury and friends do fight.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560
It's a boy.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.560
Oh, we got nothing.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.560
Maury attacks.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.560
Takes 20 damage.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.560
You weaklings!

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.560
You call that an attack?

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.560
Hero attacks Boss.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560
Boss takes 15 damage.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.560
Aubrey attacks Boss.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.560
Boss takes 17 damage.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.560
Hero attacks Boss.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.560
Takes 13 damage.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.560
Oscar cracks his neck while friends do fight.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.560
There we go.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.560
Let's keep going.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.560
Hey, that kind of hurt!

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.560
Oof!

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.560
This isn't fun anymore!

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.560
Now you've made me angry!

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:06.560
It's time for my special move!

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.560
Bloody slam!

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.560
Hero took that damage, became toast.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.560
Aw, we all became toast.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.560
Okay.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.560
Maury did not succumb.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.560
Huh?

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.560
How are you still moving?

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.560
How are you still moving?

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.560
Yeah.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.560
Maury's party was victorious!

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560
Yay!

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.560
He gained 32 AXP.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.560
You got 22 clams.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.560
Wow, we just robbed this kid too!

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.560
This isn't fair!

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560
Rematch!

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.560
I want a rematch!

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.560
Hey, so are you hurt?

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.560
I'm not worrying about me.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.560
I'm just fine.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.560
Boss, it must hurt to see people having fun without you.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.560
That doesn't mean you can ruin other people's fun.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.560
Um, I know that.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.560
There.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.560
Does that feel better?

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.560
Hey, so are you sure it's okay to do that?

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.560
Boss is bad news!

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:04.560
It's a good thing Maury held on during the final attack or else we would have all been toast!

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.560
It's okay.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.560
I trust him.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.560
When you were all fighting, you tried really hard to make sure I didn't get hurt.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.560
Is that true, boss?

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.560
I'm not sure.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.560
Is that true, boss?

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560
That's a lot of baloney.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.560
I don't need to hear these lies.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.560
This is my spot!

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.560
No one is welcome here!

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.560
Well, you probably won't be a problem as long as it stays like that.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.560
I guess that means we can go to Basil's house now.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.560
That sounds good to me.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.560
We're leaving now, boss.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.560
Don't cause any trouble, okay?

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.560
Okay, I'm ready.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.560
Let's go.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.560
Well, let's check in on Boss.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.560
Aw, okay.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.560
You're gonna swing me in the moon.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:24.560
Come on, man, put your head in it!

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.560
I like puzzles.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.560
I don't like if flowers is someone, but he's only interested in puzzles.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.560
I don't like if I find a flower puzzle or something.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.560
Maybe he would notice me.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560
Oh.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.560
I might need to make more tea soon.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.560
Come on, controls!

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.560
Controls, please let me talk!

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.560
Oh, friends.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.560
The grass feels nice here.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.560
Wanna join us, Mari?

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.560
Yeah.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:20.560
The stars shine brightly overhead.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.560
You don't have a care in the world.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.560
What's my favorite tea currently?

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.560
My favorite tea is...

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.560
Peppermint vanilla.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560
Very nice.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560
Mari learned.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.560
Observe.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.560
Thanks, perfect nice for stargazing.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.560
Banana.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.560
Let me touch the banana.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.560
Eternal banana.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.560
Yes, yes.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.560
Hello, valued customer.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.560
Welcome to my shop.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.560
Please buy something.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560
Candy.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.560
A child's favorite food.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.560
Sweet.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.560
Yoast 30 heart.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.560
Apple juice.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.560
Apparently better than orange juice.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.560
Yoast 25 juice.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.560
Jax, Yoast is small damage to offals and reduces their speed.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:23.560
Crescent is not what you wanted and flicks anger on a friend or a foal.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.560
I guess I can buy some apple juice.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.560
I'll buy apple juice.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:31.560
Thank you kindly.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.560
Candy.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.560
And I think I have enough for Jax as well.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.560
There you go.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.560
Whatever.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.560
Did you see the shippity guitar I see made?

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.560
Yeah, I did.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.560
It was cute.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560
Hop.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.560
And a hop.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.560
And a hop.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.560
And a hop.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.560
And a hop.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.560
Having fun takes too much effort to watch my friends have fun is enough for me.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.560
Peek-a-boo.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.560
I like puzzles.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.560
Come on, man.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:22.560
Put your head into it.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.560
No, this isn't my best friend.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.560
She can't say much, but she's really smart.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.560
No, this looks occupied.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.560
Okay.

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.560
Hey, Mori.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.560
How are you all doing?

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.560
Just the other day, Noelle was telling me about a cute little leaf she met.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:48.560
But she tried to be its friend and all I wanted to talk about was how much it hated bunnies.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.560
How could someone hate bunnies?

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.560
I just don't understand some people.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.560
Yes, some nutritious candy.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.560
Do you like to eat some?

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.560
You and your friend feel alike now.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.560
You want to have a picnic with your friends?

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:04.560
No.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.560
Not yet.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.560
Train station.

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560
Can you move forward?

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.560
It's Basel's house.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.560
Maybe we should go to Basel's first?

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560
Okay.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.560
Basel's house.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.560
Maybe we should go to Basel's first?

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560
Oh.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.560
Watering can.

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.560
These are sunflowers.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.560
I call that because they always face towards the sun.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.560
That's how I want to be like.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.560
Someone who can always see.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.560
Someone who always sees the bright side of things.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560
Watering can.

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.560
These flowers are called the Lillian of the Valley.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:58.560
It's said that they're able to ward off evil spirit and help people see a brighter future.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.560
I guess that's why they remind me of mine.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.560
I can always count on her to help me stay positive.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.560
What is that?

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.560
Whoa!

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.560
What's that ugly plant creature?

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.560
Don't you know, Cal?

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.560
That's a sprout mole.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.560
Sprout moles are highly intelligent creatures.

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:19.560
They also become dangerously vicious when they are lost.

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.560
Please, Mr. Sprout Mole, stop that.

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.560
You're stopping all over the flowers.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:38.560
It looks like the sprout mole is angry.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.560
Like us, sprout moles can also feel emotions.

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.560
If the sprout mole is angry, its attack is higher.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.560
On the other hand, its lower, its defense.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.560
Well, what you're saying is now is the perfect time to strike.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.560
Come on, Amore. Let's do this.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560
Why not?

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.560
We're just gonna kick its ass.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.560
Oh.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.560
Okay, that wasn't bad.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.560
You gained 22 EXP, got three clams.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.560
You found tofu.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.560
Amore grew to level two.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.560
Most of the flowers are unharmed.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.560
That's a relief.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.560
Hey, Amore.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.560
We're getting into the hang of battle.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.560
Here's a journal where we can keep track of any neat foals we come across.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.560
Nero gave you the full facts journal.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.560
There, now it's in your pocket.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.560
The journal is yours to record with.

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.560
Oh, we might pitch in sometimes too.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:52.560
Check it out through your pocket or in the player menu by the pressing B.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.560
By pressing B.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.560
Alright.

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.560
Okay.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.560
Important.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.560
Full facts.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.560
Views.

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.560
A sprout mole.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.560
A dangerous and hostile, ugly plant creature.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.560
It says it's smart, but they do not believe it is.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560
But do not believe it is not.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.560
It smells like dirty laundry.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.560
Amore.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.560
Alright.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.560
Another one!

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.560
Oh no, not again.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.560
Please, Mr. Sprout, don't stop twirling.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.560
You're destroying all of the flowers.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.560
Oh, I see.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.560
This sprout mole is happy.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.560
In that case, it has a higher chance to hit our weak spots and do more damage.

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.560
This also means it has a high chance of missing.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.560
Oh.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:16.560
Amore's party was victorious.

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.560
You got four clams, bountiful.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:24.560
Oh, sorry.

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.560
I'm going to just adjust some stuff.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560
Hmm.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:30.560
You seem to be running a lot of foals with emotion.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.560
In case you didn't know, emotions can determine how strong or weak the attack is.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560
Happy beats angry.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.560
Angry beats sad.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.560
And sad beats happy.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.560
That's depressing!

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.560
That's depressing!

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.560
Here, I even drew up a guide on how it works.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.560
I'm no artist, but I think it will get to the point.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.560
I'll put it in your pocket so you can check it out later.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.560
Got a motion chart.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.560
You want to look at that motion chart now?

01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.560
Yeah.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.560
Oh wait, that's cute.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.560
Sad, defense up speed town.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.560
Some damage to heart becomes juice.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:14.560
Angry equals attack up and defense down.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.560
Happy is luck up, speed up, and rate down.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.560
Strong to sad and strong to happy.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.560
Happy's weak to strong.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.560
Strong.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.560
Angry is strong to sad and sad is weak to angry.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.560
Happy is strong to angry.

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:37.560
And angry is weak to happy.

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.560
And neutral is just in the middle.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.560
Yeah, I'm not an artist, but this is pretty cute, yeah.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.560
I want to look at the other flowers.

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:53.560
These type of flowers are called gladiose.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.560
Gladiose, gladiolus.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:01.560
Wow, I can't read!

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.560
I can't read!

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.560
Is the gladiolus what?

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:12.560
Gladiolus, also known as the sword flower.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.560
As you might guess, it represents a strength of character.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.560
A woman who is honest with strong moral values.

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.560
Someone who stands by the conviction that gladiolus reminds me of Aubrey

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.560
because she's always true to herself.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.560
Oh, I see.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.560
But you're saying that Aubrey is really stubborn!

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.560
Hey, no I'm not!

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.560
Okay, let's move on.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.560
These are roses.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.560
Can you guess who they remind me of?

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.560
They remind me of Hero.

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.560
Can you guess correctly?

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:51.560
Roses come in many different colors and have their own unique meanings.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.560
Pink roses represent...

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.560
Oh, symbolize is admiration.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:58.560
Orange roses symbolize passion.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.560
Yellow roses symbolize friendship.

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:01.560
The list goes on.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.560
Hero doesn't remind me of any rose in particular.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:08.560
Like, heroes like all roses because he's versatile and universally loved.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.560
Oh, that's really sweet.

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.560
You got, like, so many, so many flowers based off of your friends.

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.560
Whoa, what are these flowers called?

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.560
They're all cool and spiky!

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.560
I should tell.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.560
This is the cactus.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.560
It's more of a plant than a flower.

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.560
It's funny that you ask because they remind you of you.

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.560
Is it because he's a prick?

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.560
Hey!

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:42.560
Well, not too, but mostly because cactus are very sturdy and resilient plants by nature.

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.560
I can't believe!

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.560
I can't believe!

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.560
They were like, yeah, it's because you're a prick.

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:04.560
That too.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.560
They don't need much care and can survive even in seemingly impossible conditions.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:14.560
Guess what I'm saying is that even you could take care of a cactus, Cal.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.560
Whoa, neat!

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.560
Cacti are awesome!

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:23.560
Did not even notice the inson there.

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.240
Ah, these are twice tulips.

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.240
They are simple and bulbous.

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.560
Just like a mori.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.440
Bul- bulb- bulbus?

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.560
Bulbas?

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.240
Water's off a duck's back?

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.200
Exactly like Shibi.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.560
Shibi's, like, so strong.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.560
Everything is water off a duck's back.

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:59.560
I don't know, I just think it's cute.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.560
Oh, Basil, you think I'm cute?

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.560
Uh-huh.

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:13.560
Ah, not another sprout, Mo.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.560
Not good, Basil.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.560
We gotta hang him this by now.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:25.560
Hmm, this sprout mo seemed a bit sad.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:28.560
See how it's curled up in the fetal position?

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.560
That means it won't do as much damage as normal.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:37.560
But it'll also take less damage to heart and will lose juice instead.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.560
How sad.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.560
Let's put it out of its misery.

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.560
Alright?

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.560
Hmm.

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.560
Okay.

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:13.560
I'm gonna just keep on attacking, whatever.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:21.560
I'm just like, oh wow, this thing is depressed?

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.560
Kill it.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.560
Alright.

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.560
Alright.

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.560
Oh, how'd you get here so fast, Mari?

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.560
Hi everyone, y'all just came in time for a lovely picnic.

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560
Feel free to rest here.

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:12.560
Everything is already all set up and I even brought some fruit.

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.560
Alright.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.560
Let's have a picnic with our friends.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.560
Cute.

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:31.560
Delicious fruit, would you like to eat some?

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:38.560
I mean, your friends feel like new.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.560
Munch, munch, munch, munch.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.560
Whoa, thanks, Mari, you're the best.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.560
Oh, it's nothing.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:48.560
I'm gonna look out for all of you.

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.560
Ah, Mari, I wish it could be more like you.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.560
You always seem to have everything under control.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:56.560
That's not true at all.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.560
It just seems that way from the outside.

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.560
Either way, you sure seem to make everything look easy.

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.560
Yes, I agree.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.560
Mari is effortlessly graceful.

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.560
Don't you think so, Mari?

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:19.560
Oh, Mari, stop kidding around.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.560
Is there any way to treat your big sister?

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.560
I have straight down this way.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.560
Are we all ready to go?

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.560
I'm ready when you are.

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.560
I'll catch you later, Mari.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.560
Let me know if you need anything.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.560
You soon.

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.560
Well, let's see if we can save here.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:55.560
I want to say no because I was like, nah.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560
It's the same thing.

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:04.560
Oh, shoot, I'm going the wrong direction.

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.560
I wanted to see before we go to Basil's house

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.560
if there's anything on the other areas

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.560
or if they're just blocked off, too.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.560
Give us a second.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:21.560
I feel like Basil's house is actually like a final area,

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.560
so I'm just going to check.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.560
Mari, we're supposed to go to my house.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.560
Let's just pass the cell.

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:31.560
And let's finish finding some little sprouts

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.560
and why don't you show everyone?

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.560
Come on, they're really cute.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.560
Transportation station doesn't seem to be in service.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.560
Okay, well, I guess we'll go to your house.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.560
Never mind, I wanted to find the little puzzle,

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.560
but okay, it's fine.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.560
It's fine.

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.560
Get back over here.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.560
Thank you.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.560
Okay, we saved already, so it's fine.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.560
Let's just go.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.560
What is that?

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.560
What the hecky-wecky?

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:38.560
What emotion is this feeling, Engie?

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.560
What emotion is this feeling, Engie?

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:44.560
What emotion is this feeling, Engie?

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.560
What was...

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.560
What was this feeling, Engie?

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:14.560
No.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.560
Why do you like major damage?

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.560
Help.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.560
Oh.

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.560
Yeah.

01:39:39.560 --> 01:40:05.560
I really couldn't tell what emotions I was feeling.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:23.560
Oh man, this fight is pretty tough.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.560
Don't worry, we can do this if we work together.

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:30.560
Looks like I'm going to have to teach you all a little bit about teamwork.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.560
Let's try it again, Amore.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.560
We'll get him this time.

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.560
You notice anything different, Amore?

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.560
You should see a new bar at the bottom of the screen with the number on the side.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.560
It's our collective energy.

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:48.560
By using our energy, we can beat this ball together.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.560
Just attack and you'll see.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.560
Like this.

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:22.560
It...

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.560
Hold on.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.560
You see the bubble that popped up when we attacked?

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:28.560
That's called follow-up.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:34.560
If you attack for a limited time, you can use energy to perform a follow-up.

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.560
Press any direction...

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.560
Direction or arrow and see what happens.

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.560
Alright?

01:41:48.560 --> 01:42:05.560
No, why didn't it work?

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.560
Huh.

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.560
That cost three energy.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.560
Oh, I see.

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.560
Ew.

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.560
Man, this guy's really tough.

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.560
When you attack this, did you notice that our energy went up?

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:20.560
When we take damage, we can also gain energy.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:23.560
Think of it as a chance to make a comeback.

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.560
Alright.

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:54.560
Okay, so cost three, so that's why they're not...

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.560
Okay.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.560
Nice, we're full of energy.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:04.560
Every time we use our special attack, Mari, after you attack, press to release energy.

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.560
Okay, it's the... this button?

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:07.560
Okay.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.560
Up here already?

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.560
Come on, everyone.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.560
Show this big guy what we're made of.

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:34.560
Did I do the wrong one?

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.560
Oh, I pressed the wrong one.

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.560
It was down.

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.560
Oops.

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:41.560
I thought when I said press the directional button, I was like, okay, I just pressed the

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.560
directional button because it's pressable.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:49.560
Not bad.

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:53.560
Whatever, I can do it again.

01:43:53.560 --> 01:44:03.560
My bad.

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:15.560
That was my bad.

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:21.560
Whatever.

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.560
Learn stab him.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.560
Operate group to three, level three.

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:33.560
Hero group to level three, yeah.

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:34.560
And there you have it.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.560
Geralt's battle tutorial 101.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:42.560
And I'm sure that we fight more battles, our team work will improve over time.

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:46.560
Oh, you guys, that was so amazing.

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.560
Yeah, that was nothing.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.560
I could have taken...

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:52.560
I could have taken away better gear guys than that.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.560
I should teach you some of my skills one of those days.

01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:00.560
Basil, I know you're not the type that likes to fight, but it's good to know how to defend

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.560
yourself, too.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:06.560
You know, I've actually been working on a book all about battles.

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.560
Maybe we can all study together next time.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.560
I'll give it to Omori to hold on for now.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:18.560
I'm just the pack mule, hey?

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:24.560
Yes, we get stronger, I'll be updating the follow-up section of the self-help guide,

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.560
so you should just check it out every now and then.

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:34.560
Omori, you should know when we gain EXP and level up, sometimes we also learn skill.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.560
Skills are powerful and have a wide range of effects, but each of us can only remember

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.560
up to four skills at a time.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.560
After you learn a new skill, don't forget to equip it from the player menu, okay?

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.560
Yeah, yeah, we know.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.560
We got a Basil's house now.

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.560
Okay, that's all I had to say.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.560
Ah, Patience Kale.

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:54.560
Kale?

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.560
Kale?

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.560
I'm calling him Kale.

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.560
There was an old lady who lived in a shoe.

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:08.560
What was that nursery rhyme again?

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.560
I totally forgot.

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:17.560
Hey, cheese!

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.560
Hold on, let me look it up.

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:25.560
Let me look it up.

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:29.560
Oh, lady who lived...

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.560
Okay.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.560
Okay, let's see.

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.560
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:42.560
She had so many children she didn't know what to do.

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.560
She gave them some broth and a big slice of bread.

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:47.560
She kissed them all soundly and sent them to bed.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.560
There you go.

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:53.560
Do you guys know that nursery rhyme?

01:46:53.560 --> 01:47:07.560
That's not the version you know.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:11.560
What version did you have now?

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.560
Well, it came out kind of blurry.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.560
Well, it's okay, it gives character.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.560
If you don't mind the photo.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.560
Of course we don't mind, I won't see it.

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:22.560
Oh, sure thing.

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:27.560
Y'all look so cute!

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.560
Now's my hair.

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:37.560
I wanna see, I wanna see!

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:42.560
Oh, hey Amari, you wanna look at the photo too?

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:51.560
Yeah, it is blurry.

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.560
Whip them all soundly and pop them to bed is the one I know.

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:58.560
Oh, okay, okay, I guess.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:01.560
Okay, okay, I...

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.560
Okay, well that one's a little darker.

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.560
I definitely learned the version I just read.

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.560
See how it came out kind of blurry?

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:14.560
But you can...

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.560
But y'all still look so cute.

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:20.560
I should add it to my collection.

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.560
Oh, woohoo, another shot for the full album.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.560
Oh, Wolver, Amari, I can't see.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.560
Hey, stop pushing!

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560
You already had your turn!

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560
Get out of my way, Cal!

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:36.560
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, there's no need to fight.

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:37.560
Me first!

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.560
No, me!

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.560
Ah, stop it!

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.560
You guys are knocking me over.

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.560
Uh, oops.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.560
Oh my gosh, Basel!

01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.560
Basel, we're so sorry!

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.560
You okay, Basel?

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.560
You two are in big trouble now.

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.560
This is why both of you need to learn how to get along.

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:08.560
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, hero.

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.560
Please don't tell Amari.

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.560
It's okay, don't worry about it.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.560
Accidents happened.

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.560
Here's your photos.

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.560
It doesn't look like any of them got damaged.

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:31.560
Let's put them back in your photo album together.

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.560
You hero?

01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.560
Let's go inside my house first.

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.560
Remember to wipe your feet before you come in.

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:44.560
Everybody, wipe your feet before you go in, okay?

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:50.560
Wait a second, hold on.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:52.560
Is there anything around here?

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:54.560
Anything special? No.

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.560
Okay, we just go in though.

01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.560
Wipe your feet!

01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.560
You guys wiping?

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.560
Zephyze, wipe your feet!

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.560
Basel's photo album.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.560
It's the most precious belonging.

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.560
Are you ready to put the photo?

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.560
Put back the photos Amari?

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:14.560
Yeah.

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.560
Yeah, let's get started.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:23.560
I don't think I remember the order of these photos.

01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.560
No, I'm not a thing, Basel.

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.560
Amari has really good memories, I'm sure.

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.560
We'll figure this out in no time.

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.560
Lies in me!

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.560
Oh.

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.560
I think it was this one.

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.560
Or not, hold on.

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.560
Wait, no, I need to put it back!

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.560
I wanted to...

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.560
Okay.

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:24.560
Is that correct?

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:26.560
Basel's memory.

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.560
There, it's new.

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.560
Really sorry for pushing you over, Basel.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:37.560
Even though at least half of it was Kels' fault.

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:39.560
Yeah, I promise.

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:41.560
Never to ever, to never fall for it.

01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.560
I'm sorry.

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.560
I'm sorry.

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.560
I'm sorry.

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.560
I'm sorry.

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:53.560
Ever, to never fight with Aubrey ever again, unless she starts this first.

01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.560
No worry about it.

01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:01.560
I know you only wanted to see my photo album.

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:04.560
Thank you for helping me put it back together.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.560
That's strange.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.560
Photo must have been loose.

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.560
Huh? What's this?

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.560
Can I take this photo?

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.560
Something about it seems...

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.560
...well familiar.

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.560
No, no.

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.560
I can't be.

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.560
My face!

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.560
Huh?

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:46.560
Meow?

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.560
What do you do around here, is there?

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.560
Get you a box for wiping your sorrows away.

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.560
Your sketchbook.

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.560
Take a look inside.

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.560
You only got...

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:02.560
Oh, what the heck is that? That's new.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.560
You booted up your laptop.

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.560
What'd you like to do?

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:10.560
Look at your screen.

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:12.560
Let's share it at the screen.

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.560
In your journal.

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.560
Everything? Okay.

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:25.560
The heat from the laptop warmed your lap.

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.560
It felt nice.

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:48.560
Meow?

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.560
Meow? Or is there?

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.560
For a way out?

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.560
There's one.

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:10.560
But...

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.560
Meow? Waiting for something to happen?

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.560
Light bulb hangs from the ceiling.

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:20.560
Wherever it is.

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.560
Looking for light bulb?

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:27.560
It's black inside.

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.560
You can't see a thing.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.560
Cow!

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.560
Oh, what?

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.560
Cat?

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.560
What do you say?

01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.560
Something you do?

01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.560
I would just ignore it.

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.560
But...

01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.560
when all those red things, they're like cans

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.560
and it brings you back to the beginning.

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:32.560
Oh, there's more of them.

01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:56.560
I can't remember.

01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:25.560
Oh, there's more.

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:34.560
Huh.

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:52.560
Kat, tell me what the fuck I need to do.

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.560
What's my charm?

01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:14.560
What do I need to like?

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:43.560
Never mind.

01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:46.560
There's a stab one here.

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.560
Dab? Who? Stab me?

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.560
Okay.

01:57:51.560 --> 01:58:05.560
Okay.

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:17.560
Ow.

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.560
Are you gonna take it? Yeah?

01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:28.560
Look at all of us.

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:40.560
There are all our memories together.

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:47.560
They're a little sad now.

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:52.560
But we should be happy that they happened at all.

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.560
Oh, Zerah's in chat?

01:58:55.560 --> 01:59:20.560
Let's make some new memories together, okay?

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:23.560
You see a boy sleeping in his room.

01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:26.560
What's his name?

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:31.560
You guys want to be sunny?

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:36.560
I guess we got a default name.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:43.560
Or should I go for a regular?

01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:49.560
Regular name. You guys want to be...

01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:51.560
Does my senpai want to be...

01:59:51.560 --> 02:00:04.560
You want to be senpai? Okay.

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.560
That's uppercase senpai.

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:08.560
S

02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:11.560
E

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:13.560
N

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.560
D

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:17.560
A

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:23.560
I

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.560
The boy's name is senpai?

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:45.560
Yeah.

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.560
Hey senpai, it's mommy.

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:51.560
I'm still in the city setting things up for our new home.

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:53.560
Did you finish packing yet?

02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.560
Movers are going to be at our house in a few days,

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:58.560
so I left a list of things for you to do before they arrive.

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:00.560
Oh, so sorry. Mommy messed up.

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:02.560
I forgot to tell you the electric company

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:05.560
that we need a few extra days before we're ready to move,

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:08.560
so the lights might be cut out sometime tonight.

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:12.560
Anyway, I know moving to a new place can be a little nerve-wracking right now,

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:17.560
but I think a change of scenery will be positive for both of us.

02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.560
I know you haven't talked to anyone in a while,

02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:22.560
but you might want to say goodbye to your old friends before we leave.

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:25.560
How's it going to have... has been really...

02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:28.560
I've been really... that's what I can't read right now.

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:35.560
How's it been trying really hard to get ahold of you

02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:38.560
ever since we put our house up for sale?

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.560
He's been calling us every week for the past few months.

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:43.560
He seems a little lonely.

02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:45.560
Maybe he should pay him a visit.

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.560
Okay, that's it for now.

02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:50.560
Mommy loves you. Bye, honey.

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:52.560
Zzz.

02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:57.560
You are hungry.

02:01:58.560 --> 02:01:59.560
An old computer.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.560
A bunch of books.

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.560
Cardboard boxes littered across the house.

02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:09.560
Or a drope.

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:12.560
An ordinary house plan. Nothing special about it.

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:14.560
Table lamp.

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:21.440
Mums, do you know- Hi senpai, this is a note from mommy.

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.640
I left some food in this fridge for you downstairs.

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:26.240
It's steak, your favorite.

02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:27.240
Love you!

02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.240
Hugs and kisses.

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:33.240
Mums, to-do list.

02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:40.560
I don't feel like doing chores right now.

02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:44.560
A bathtub.

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.560
It's me.

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:50.560
Hi senpai, this is a note from mommy.

02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.560
Remember to brush your teeth every day.

02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:54.560
Love you!

02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.560
Hugs and kisses.

02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:58.560
Towels and toiletries.

02:02:58.560 --> 02:02:59.560
Toilet.

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:00.560
Haha, it's shibby!

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:01.560
I mean-

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:09.560
She's gonna fucking kill me.

02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:11.560
She's gonna fucking kill me.

02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.560
She's gonna fucking kill me.

02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:27.560
No, don't tell Ezra!

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:32.560
She's gonna fucking kill me.

02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:34.560
Are you not here for me for a few days?

02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.560
Yeah.

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.560
I'm trapped in Wonderland, okay?

02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.560
Hahaha!

02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:55.560
This is ma, a big houseland.

02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:00.560
One of two old grandfather couples.

02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:03.560
They stopped working a long time ago, but mom likes to keep them around.

02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:08.560
What case has been cleared out?

02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.560
A nary houseplant.

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.560
Nothing special, wow.

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:13.560
About it.

02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:15.560
Yeah!

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:21.560
Yeah, I feel like shibby is gonna kill me.

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.560
She's gonna fucking murder me.

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:26.560
I mean, I'll hear me for a week.

02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:28.560
You know why?

02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:30.560
I'll come back, though.

02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:34.560
I'll just get, I'll get Emmy to bring me back.

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.560
I'll get Emmy to bring me back.

02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.560
That's no problem.

02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:42.560
Carver box is littered across the house.

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.560
This empty picnic basket.

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.560
Would you like to save?

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:48.560
Yeah.

02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:52.560
Oh, now I'm colored in.

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:55.560
Some family photos.

02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:58.560
Carver boxes are littered across the house.

02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:04.560
Mom said, the mattress is too hard for you to sleep comfortably.

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:16.560
It's fine, it's fine.

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:17.560
Probably.

02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:20.560
Are you sure you want to go downstairs?

02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:23.560
What do you mean, are you sure?

02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:25.560
I checked everything up here, right?

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:27.560
No?

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:29.560
Is there things I didn't see?

02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:33.560
Okay, well, sure, whatever.

02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:40.560
What, no?

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.560
Why not?

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:44.560
Ah, metal!

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:45.560
Metal!

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:47.560
Metal's ringing!

02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:02.560
Hi Raiders, welcome!

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:05.560
Welcome to the stream!

02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:09.560
Metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal!

02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:12.560
Metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal!

02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:17.560
Welcome, metal!

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:24.560
Welcome, metal, from UMAP Plus!

02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:32.560
Welcome to the stream!

02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:38.560
Wow, have you guys checked out metal yet?

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:40.560
UMAP Plus girls are so cute.

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:42.560
Cute, cute, cute, cute, cute.

02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.560
Welcome Raiders!

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:46.560
Hello Raiders!

02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:47.560
Welcome to the stream!

02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:48.560
I'm playing Amore right now.

02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:51.560
My name is MercyModees from VLRs.

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:54.560
Gen 1 Indulge!

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:55.560
Welcome to the stream!

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:58.560
I really appreciate Metal bringing you in.

02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:01.560
Meryl, what did you play?

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.560
Or what did you do?

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:11.560
I'm so glad, thank you!

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.560
I played Zero Escape.

02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:20.560
Oh my gosh, I love the Nonary series.

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:24.560
I'm bad at numbers, but I love the Nonary series.

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.560
When I first got nine persons, nine doors, nine hours,

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:31.560
I don't remember the order it was in.

02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:35.560
I literally thought I only had nine hours to complete it.

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:40.560
So I was like putting it off for a while.

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:43.560
Turns out, you know, that's just the story

02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:47.560
and I didn't actually need only nine hours to play

02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:50.560
when I played it on DS.

02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:53.560
I got it gifted by a friend.

02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:58.560
That's like, oh no!

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:01.560
Oh my gosh, I thought, oh my god, no,

02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:03.560
I thought the escape parts were time to nine,

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:06.560
but it's two, me too!

02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:16.560
Me too, I thought, I thought I only had nine,

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.560
like literally nine hours to just do it.

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:23.560
So it was rough.

02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:24.560
It was rough times.

02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:26.560
But yeah, I'm glad, I'm glad.

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:29.560
Are you pretty far into it?

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:31.560
It's such a fun game.

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:33.560
It's such a fun game.

02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.560
I've completed the entire series,

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:36.560
so I don't think I'll stream it.

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:40.560
But if you guys want to check out the Nonary's Zero Escape,

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:44.560
check out Merrill playing it.

02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:45.560
It's probably fun.

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:46.560
It's probably lots of fun.

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:48.560
I think it's lots of fun.

02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:50.560
I said probably because I was nervous,

02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:52.560
some pies would be like, oh, I don't know.

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:54.560
Puzzle games, that's not my thing.

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:57.560
But guess what? Puzzle games are my thing.

02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:58.560
I'm a second game now.

02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:00.560
It's been big fun so far.

02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.560
Yeah!

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.560
Did you stream the first game too?

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.560
I'm sure people would love to see a lot of it.

02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:13.560
Mercy, have you played Ibb?

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:14.560
Yeah, I played Ibb.

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:17.560
Not the new one, where they extended a lot of stuff,

02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:21.560
but like the old one.

02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:22.560
When it was free.

02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.560
When Ibb was free, I played it when it was free.

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.560
Like a long, long time ago.

02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.560
I did, yeah, I finished the first one on stream.

02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:33.560
Yeah, everybody go check that out, okay?

02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:34.560
Check out the first one,

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:38.560
and then check out the playthrough for Merrill's one.

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:39.560
Yeah, I love puzzle games.

02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:41.560
It's so fun.

02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:43.560
Thank you so much for the raid once again.

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:44.560
I really appreciate it.

02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:46.560
Right now, we gotta figure out

02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:49.560
how to go down the stairs.

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:50.560
I have some studying to do.

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:53.560
I'll be looking to have a big fun stream, Mercy.

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.560
Okay, good luck with your study.

02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:58.560
Work hard and get those grades up.

02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:00.560
A plus all around.

02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.560
Wee!

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:09.560
And now the rest of you are with me.

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:16.560
Yeah, I'm winking, but you can't tell

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:21.560
because I am wearing an eye patch.

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:25.560
So let's continue.

02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:29.560
So, can I not go downstairs?

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:43.560
Hmm.

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:50.560
Isn't the beach this bathtub?

02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:58.560
I feel like I literally have gone through everything.

02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.560
Why not?

02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:01.560
Get your ass down there.

02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:03.560
Close your eyes.

02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.560
You feel dizzy.

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:10.560
Maybe you can sleep it off.

02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:12.560
No, go downstairs.

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:14.560
Okay, fine.

02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:15.560
Fine, fine.

02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:17.560
We'll go back to bed.

02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:19.560
A little.

02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:28.560
Now, I guess I have to go to sleep.

02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:35.560
No, you definitely are hungry.

02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:37.560
Get the fuck out of bed.

02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:48.560
You've a glowing light, what?

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:06.560
Oh, look!

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:09.560
Senpai, do you need a hand?

02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:14.560
Are stairs always as steep?

02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:16.560
Well, maybe if you're scared of them.

02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:23.560
No, you can do it.

02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:37.560
That's a real hand!

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:45.560
That's a real hand.

02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:48.560
Go away, go away, go away.

02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:50.560
Okay.

02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:59.560
What will Senpai do?

02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:01.560
Senpai, what are you going to do?

02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:06.560
Something.

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:14.560
Can I run?

02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:16.560
Can I only fight?

02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.560
Okay.

02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:25.560
No.

02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:36.560
Senpai.

02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:02.560
Take a deep breath.

02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:04.560
Don't be afraid.

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.560
It's not as scary as you think.

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:09.560
You steady yourself.

02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:11.560
Remember how to calm down.

02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:13.560
I'm still sick, man.

02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:15.560
Oh, we made it down the stairs.

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:17.560
Woo!

02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:44.560
Well, it's fine.

02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.560
Think of me to calm down, Senpai.

02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:51.560
You were thinking about me, right?

02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:54.560
You got a first aid kit.

02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:01.560
The case has been cleared out.

02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:05.560
Why not?

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:08.560
Okay, well, let's...

02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.560
No.

02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.560
Look in the fridge and found cold steak.

02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:25.560
Take it.

02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.560
You got cold steak.

02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:30.560
Probably should heat it up before you eat it.

02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:33.560
I'll grab the knife after.

02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:36.560
The cold steak in the microwave.

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:45.560
You got microwave steak.

02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.560
Where's my steak?

02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:54.560
You pick up the steak knife.

02:15:56.560 --> 02:15:59.560
Yes, a lovingly well done steak.

02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:01.560
Would you like to eat something?

02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:03.560
Yeah.

02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:14.560
What's Chat's favorite...

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:16.560
I'm not Chat, sorry.

02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:19.560
Oh, have it die hard.

02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:22.560
Senpai, what's your favorite food?

02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:25.560
Actually, I already know, but...

02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.560
Your stomach didn't agree with that.

02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:39.560
Well, time to find the toilet.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:43.560
That was mom's room.

02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:45.560
Bathroom is this one.

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:47.560
Time to barf.

02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:51.560
Bleurgh.

02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:13.560
Mercy lemonade?

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:17.560
What?

02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:19.560
Mercy lemonade is what?

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:24.560
Let's see.

02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.560
Icy lemonade!

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:35.560
Where are you guys?

02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:38.560
Where's Senpai's getting these lemonades from?

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:43.560
Yeah, yeah, it's a drink.

02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:46.560
Not food, but I mean, I guess if it's your favorite,

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.560
I can treat you to more.

02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:54.560
The air-cooler lemonade stand.

02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:10.560
Oh my god.

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:12.560
Oh my gosh.

02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:15.560
What's the price for lemonade nowadays?

02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:19.560
It used to be 25 cents for a cup back in...

02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:21.560
back in the old days.

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.560
I prefer milk.

02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:33.560
Azura.

02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.560
Okay, we can sell milk on the side too.

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:37.560
This is a startup.

02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:40.560
We're gonna do a violour lemonade stand.

02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:48.560
So, milk costs maybe like...

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:51.560
How much does milk cost nowadays?

02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:54.560
I usually leave the shop into mama.

02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:56.560
Mama and papa.

02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:00.560
Milk spoil is easy though.

02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:03.560
Okay, well maybe we can do like...

02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:06.560
like, you know, we take that milk

02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:09.560
and then we make it into ice cream with the lemonade.

02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:12.560
So then we have like a lemonade swirl.

02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:14.560
Yeah?

02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:16.560
And then we package it.

02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:21.560
Now we package it.

02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:32.560
Now we package it and then we sell it at the...

02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:34.560
at the lemonade stand.

02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.560
We'll run it illegally of course.

02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:39.560
We won't get a business license.

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:51.560
Self-squeezed.

02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:55.560
Oh my gosh.

02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:59.560
Azura, Azura should definitely...

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:03.560
should definitely like be the brains of this operation.

02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:06.560
Freshly, fresh milk...

02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:11.560
Fresh milk with every pop.

02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:14.560
I can't even mimic Azura's voice.

02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:18.560
Fresh milk with every drop.

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.560
Azura's so much better.

02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:43.560
I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.

02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:46.560
I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:49.560
I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.

02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:52.560
Yes, we all want Azura's milks.

02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:07.560
Azura could probably crash the milk market.

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.560
Yeah.

02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:13.560
I swear if Azura like came...

02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:17.560
Simpa, you know the mega milk shirt?

02:21:17.560 --> 02:21:21.560
Like, I feel like, you know, Azura would like be...

02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:24.560
you know, ultra milk or something.

02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:28.560
Mercy milk would be competitor?

02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:31.560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:36.560
You haven't tried warm, delicious Azura milk yet.

02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:40.560
Okay?

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:47.560
So everyone, we're going to...

02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:50.560
Simpa, we're going to pitch this idea to Strony.

02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:54.560
It's going to be a new business venture and we're going to make millions.

02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:57.560
Okay? We're going to be millionaires.

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:07.560
Have you tried warm, delicious Azura milk?

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:09.560
Of course.

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:11.560
Everyone in Bielor has.

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:15.560
Hahaha.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:24.560
Can we get GamerSup's cup with you guys on it?

02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:27.560
Well, I don't know.

02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:31.560
You'll have to probably pass that idea on to Strony

02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:34.560
or I don't know, harass GamerSup.

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:37.560
No, actually do not harass GamerSup's for it.

02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:39.560
That was a joke.

02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:46.560
That's a joke, but like, you know, that's a joke.

02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:48.560
I promise that part was a joke.

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:54.560
If anyone does it, I relinquish all responsibility for that.

02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:56.560
Thank you.

02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:04.560
No, no, no, no, no, do it.

02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:10.560
But yeah, everyone in Bielor has tried...

02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:14.560
Azura milk.

02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:19.560
And I think everyone should too, especially if you're a bleeding heart.

02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:22.560
I know. Is it bleeding heart?

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:26.560
Oh, I'm so bad. I'm forgetting fan names.

02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:37.560
Yeah, it's bleeding hearts.

02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:39.560
Okay, whoo.

02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:42.560
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:46.560
I was like, am I mismer... remembering things?

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:56.560
Well, we'll bring this, we'll make millions, millions.

02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:00.560
If I get into Gen 2, can we get Azura milk?

02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:02.560
Of course, only if you get into Gen 2.

02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:04.560
But first, pay attention to Gen 1.

02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:06.560
Us, okay? Us.

02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:10.560
We just came out, come on, you already want the next big thing?

02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:12.560
I'll fucking kill you.

02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:15.560
Oh, sorry, that sounded more like Serani.

02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:17.560
Okay?

02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:21.560
I'll kill you.

02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:26.560
And then...

02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:30.560
there won't be a Senpai anymore.

02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:32.560
So pay attention to us.

02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:34.560
First.

02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:38.560
Enjoy us, what do we... when we can.

02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:45.560
But what if I like being stabbed?

02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:47.560
Then you won't get stabbed, easy peasy, right?

02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:49.560
Isn't that punishment enough?

02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:56.560
So, be good. Be good.

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:57.560
Let's...

02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:59.560
We'll cross the bridge when we get there.

02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:02.560
Right now, you have to pay attention to me.

02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:04.560
Azura.

02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:05.560
Chibi.

02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:06.560
Icy.

02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:09.560
Emi.

02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:10.560
Stroni.

02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:12.560
Understudi.

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:18.560
I'm sorry.

02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:19.560
I'm sorry.

02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:20.560
I'm sorry.

02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:21.560
I'm sorry.

02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:22.560
I'm sorry.

02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:23.560
I'm sorry.

02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:25.560
Good.

02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:27.560
Good Senpai.

02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:28.560
Good.

02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:31.560
Good boys and good girls.

02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:34.560
I'm glad we have our understanding.

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:37.560
How could you talk about anyone else?

02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:39.560
Even a figurative anyone else.

02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:41.560
You need us right now.

02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:44.560
That's all you need right now is us.

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:46.560
So, no more of that.

02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:48.560
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:51.560
And that's not for at least another year.

02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:56.560
So, shh.

02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:57.560
Shhh.

02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:58.560
Shhh.

02:25:58.560 --> 02:25:59.560
Shhh.

02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:00.560
Shhh.

02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:01.560
Shhh.

02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:02.560
Shhh.

02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:03.560
Shhh.

02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:04.560
Shhh.

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:05.560
Shhh.

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.560
Shhh.

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.560
Shhh.

02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:08.560
Shhh.

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:09.560
Shhh.

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:10.560
Shhh.

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:11.560
Shhh.

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:12.560
Shhh.

02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:15.560
Good.

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.560
I'm good.

02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:19.560
Good Senpai.

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:22.560
You're so kind and trusting.

02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:24.560
I knew you would understand.

02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:28.560
Alright.

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:29.560
So we just threw up.

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.560
You threw up.

02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.560
Yep.

02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:38.560
Yep.

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:39.560
Thought so.

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:43.560
Hahaha.

02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:46.560
Can we flush it?

02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:47.560
I threw up.

02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:48.560
I threw up.

02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:49.560
Mom, I threw up.

02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:52.560
Hahaha.

02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:53.560
Stanny.

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:55.560
Imagine standing outside of Adrien's garden.

02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:56.560
Mom, me?

02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:58.560
I threw up.

02:26:58.560 --> 02:26:59.560
Wait, what?

02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:03.560
No, let me back down!

02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:09.560
What the heck?

02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:13.560
Hey.

02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:15.560
Hey Senpai, it's Mari.

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:16.560
Hahaha.

02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:21.560
I'm finally back home, but I forgot my keys.

02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:23.560
Could you open the door for me?

02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:25.560
Yeah, sure!

02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:36.560
Open the door!

02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:37.560
Open the door!

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:53.560
Stop having it be closed.

02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:58.560
Hahaha.

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:00.560
Oops.

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:02.560
Spooky.

02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:08.560
Did we hear something else?

02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:37.560
Something.

02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:42.560
Maybe it's the bathroom?

02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:54.560
Alright, I guess we gotta look in the mirror.

02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:55.560
Right?

02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:57.560
Senpai?

02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:01.560
Ooh, spooky!

02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:07.560
Nope, not there anymore.

02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:14.560
Spooky?

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:17.560
Did your heart race a little bit?

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:33.560
It only races for mercy.

02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:34.560
Oh, you!

02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:37.560
My Senpais are so kind to me.

02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:39.560
I knew everyone loved me.

02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.560
Do we go to sleep now?

02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:46.560
Yeah, we'll go to sleep.

02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:03.560
Why is Senpai's mom so absent?

02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:07.560
Mom went out to the city to check out the new house.

02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:11.560
Welcome to white space.

02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:16.560
You've been living here as long as you can remember.

02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:30.560
Meow, waiting for something to happen?

02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:36.560
Tissue box for wiping your sorrows away.

02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:40.560
Is something gonna update now?

02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:45.560
Okay, so now I know at least this is a steak.

02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:47.560
A steak.

02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:59.560
Collect keys.

02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:02.560
What's this?

02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:11.560
In the grass near a stump on a shrouded old bridge

02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:16.560
between giant pinwheels near a cast-off cartridge

02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:19.560
underneath a wet pillow within a large flame

02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:23.560
beneath a trapped door lost in Pyre's flame

02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:28.560
lying in a dark cell trapped in a pink cage

02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:32.560
in a hall of framed faces far below a big stage.

02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:37.560
Spending time with a frog near a game of roulette

02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:39.560
amongst the other owls in a water closet

02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:42.560
in a small moving room at the end of the plank

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:47.560
within a live shell in a large bubbly tank

02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:51.560
surrounded by goo captured in a steel trap

02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:54.560
the gut of a whale at the end of a map

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:58.560
in the field of white snow past the end of the road.

02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:00.560
Okay.

02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:08.560
Is that my stomach?

02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:10.560
Something found nearby.

02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:18.560
What's this?

02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:23.560
You found a map.

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:27.560
Okay.

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:34.560
Press right button to open the headspace map.

02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:37.560
Like that. Okay.

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:40.560
And then we can just open this up.

02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:42.560
Okay, to collect things.

02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:49.560
Okay, we have that now.

02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:52.560
Okay.

02:32:57.560 --> 02:33:00.560
That was a pretty heavy map, yeah.

02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:03.560
Hey, Doorcast, if you'd like to do,

02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:06.560
we should open the door.

02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:17.560
Yeah, we should open the door.

02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:22.560
Okay.

02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:29.560
No.

02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:32.560
Mari, thank goodness you're here.

02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:35.560
Have you seen Basil?

02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:37.560
I can't find him anywhere.

02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:41.560
We should, we should go tell Mari you're okay.

02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:44.560
Oh my goodness.

02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:47.560
Oh my goodness.

02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:49.560
Ooh.

02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:55.560
Will Senpai allow me a bit of time to make another tea?

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:59.560
Of course you will. You have no choice.

02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:03.560
Senpais always want me in best health, right?

02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:06.560
Okay, I'm going to go make some tea so that I,

02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:09.560
I'm out of liquid right now.

02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:11.560
Can we get tea too? Of course.

02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:14.560
I'll tell you what tea I make this time, okay?

02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:15.560
Thank you.

02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:21.560
I'll be right back. I'm going to just make a tea.

02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:48.560
Okay.

02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:18.560
Okay.

02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:48.560
Okay.

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:18.560
Okay.

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:48.560
Okay.

02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:18.560
Okay.

02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:48.560
Okay.

02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:18.560
Okay.

02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:48.560
Okay.

02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:18.560
Okay.

02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:48.560
Okay.

02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:18.560
Okay.

02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:49.560
Okay.

02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:18.560
Okay.

02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:49.560
Okay.

02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:19.560
Okay.

02:42:47.560 --> 02:43:16.560
Senpai, what are you doing?

02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:24.560
What are you doing? What have you done?

02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:30.560
Spill it.

02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:31.560
Spill it.

02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:32.560
Spill it.

02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:34.560
Drop what's, whatever's in your mouth.

02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.560
Open.

02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:38.560
Nothing, nothing.

02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:40.560
Took you long enough.

02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:41.560
Hi.

02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:42.560
Okay.

02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:46.560
I may have accidentally boiled the water a little too full,

02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:48.560
so I had to clean that up a little bit.

02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:55.560
Uh-huh.

02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:56.560
Uh-huh.

02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.560
You were just cleaning, huh?

02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:00.560
What were you cleaning?

02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:02.560
What mess did I leave out?

02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:04.560
What mess did you leave out?

02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:06.560
No ping pong.

02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:08.560
You were playing ping pong?

02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:13.560
Without me?

02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:15.560
Senpai.

02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:19.560
Senpai, how could you?

02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:20.560
Anyways, today's...

02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:30.560
Anyways, to, right now, the tea that I decided to go with is echinacea.

02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:33.560
Echinacea tea.

02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:36.560
Same one that I always do.

02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:44.560
You brought a pool table to everybody into the cage.

02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:45.560
Back again.

02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:48.560
Everyone.

02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:54.560
Where the universal, universal shock collar that we all got from Shibi.

02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:00.560
And we're putting the shock collar to 10.

02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:07.560
Bzzzzz.

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:36.840
Now, everybody's shocked.

02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:38.680
Since when were there shock callers in Wonderland?

02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:39.680
Since forever.

02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:42.320
I mean, like, that place is full of toys everywhere.

02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:43.320
Come on.

02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:46.600
Hey, yeah, I get some of my stuff with them.

02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:48.040
You bring tea for the rest of us?

02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:50.640
You didn't ask me to bring you back tea, Senpai.

02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:52.760
You want me to make you a cup all over again?

02:45:58.120 --> 02:45:59.840
I'm still waiting for this one to cool.

02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:03.280
We did ask, though.

02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:04.280
Oh, did you?

02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:05.640
I must have not heard.

02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:14.920
I must have not heard.

02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:17.120
I'll make everyone a little cup later.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.480
Is Echinacea OK?

02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:45.320
Anything.

02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:46.320
OK.

02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:48.320
I'll boil up a teapot.

02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:50.320
I'll bring out the finest teapot.

02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:56.320
I'll bring out the finest teapot and the finest china there is.

02:46:57.320 --> 02:46:59.320
There'll be, like, little cats on them or something.

02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:04.320
Actually, I do have a cat one.

02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:06.320
Yeah, I have a really cute cat one.

02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:15.320
We want to hear our cup.

02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:17.320
There are six.

02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:18.320
Fight for them.

02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:32.320
Fight for them.

02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:38.320
Mercy lemonade.

02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:39.320
You've been bad.

02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:41.320
Why would I give you that?

02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:45.320
I also don't have lemons with me, so you have to wait a few days.

02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:50.320
You have to wait a few days, and I'll come back with the lemonade.

02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:53.320
And then, yeah, it'll be fine.

02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:07.320
Well, let's continue, since you've all been so bad.

02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:10.320
Are lemons even in season?

02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:11.320
Good question.

02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:19.320
Maybe I'll get, like, those lemon zest, and then we'll sprinkle it.

02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:21.320
We'll put some a little bit into water.

02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:45.320
And then maybe, maybe we'll dilute it, and then no one will notice.

02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:50.320
No one will notice at that point.

02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:52.320
You should go tell Mara you're okay.

02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:53.320
She's worried sick.

02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:56.320
Oh, am I stuck out of the window?

02:48:56.320 --> 02:48:57.320
There we go.

02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:00.320
I'm still going to let the tea cool a bit, though.

02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:02.320
But thank you, senpai.

02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:07.320
Stretch.

02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:16.320
Okay, we should go tell Mara you're okay.

02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:18.320
Just give me a second.

02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:19.320
Okay.

02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:20.320
Okay.

02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:21.320
Okay.

02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:24.320
We should go tell Mara you're okay.

02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:26.320
Just give me a second.

02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:29.320
We should tell Mara you're okay.

02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:30.320
She's been worried sick.

02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:35.320
I don't know, glies.

02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:36.320
Let's get this toaster.

02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:39.320
Toast.

02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:47.320
It's going out all night.

02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:49.320
Here's your allowance for today.

02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:50.320
I got 200 clams.

02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:52.320
I got 200 clams!

02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:04.320
They said there was one.

02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:05.320
Hold on.

02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:08.320
In the grass near a stump.

02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:14.320
Oh, there it is.

02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:16.320
Oh.

02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:18.320
Hey.

02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:26.320
11 keys left.

02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:47.320
I'll build a sand castle again.

02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:52.320
Okay, let's see.

02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:55.320
Next one on a shrouded old bridge.

02:50:57.320 --> 02:50:59.320
I'm not sure if this is the bridge.

02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:06.320
And there's like a bunch of A's at the end.

02:51:09.320 --> 02:51:10.320
Hmm.

02:51:14.320 --> 02:51:15.320
Hmm.

02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:26.320
I'm lying.

02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:27.320
You're okay.

02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:32.320
Don't worry.

02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:34.320
Don't worry me like that.

02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:37.320
Where's Basil?

02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:46.320
He's not with you, Maury?

02:51:47.320 --> 02:51:48.320
No.

02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:50.320
I'm afraid not.

02:51:50.320 --> 02:51:54.320
The last thing I remember was sorting photos with Basil in his house.

02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:55.320
Next thing I know.

02:51:55.320 --> 02:51:59.320
I'm waking up in neighbor's room with Aubrey and Cal.

02:52:15.320 --> 02:52:16.320
Ah.

02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:23.320
At least we found you, Maury.

02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:25.320
I hope Basil's okay.

02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:27.320
He's gonna protect him if we're not there.

02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:30.320
We'll be such a downer, Aubrey.

02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:32.320
We'll find Basil for sure.

02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:34.320
Absolutely right, Cal.

02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:37.320
It's times like this we got to stay positive.

02:52:39.320 --> 02:52:41.320
I only go back to Basil's house.

02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:43.320
Might be something we missed.

02:52:43.320 --> 02:52:45.320
That's the spirit hero.

02:52:45.320 --> 02:52:48.320
He's always up here if you need me.

02:52:52.320 --> 02:52:53.320
Merci.

02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:57.320
May I ask what the guidelines are on Villalor fan video games?

02:52:57.320 --> 02:53:00.320
I don't see anything about on the Villalor website.

02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:01.320
Hmm.

02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:05.320
Is it not on the terms of service?

02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:08.320
Not terms of service, the fan work guidelines?

02:53:09.320 --> 02:53:10.320
Oops.

02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:11.320
Hold on.

02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:14.320
Let me put this down a little bit.

02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:19.320
I'm a controller.

02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:24.320
Right now my lips are a little dry,

02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:26.320
so I'm gonna have to put lip balm on.

02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:42.320
But I don't think there's anything against it,

02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:46.320
but you'll probably have to ask Stronny for management for that.

02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:49.320
Or I'll send in an email through the website.

02:53:49.320 --> 02:53:51.320
I'm not like a reliable source.

02:53:59.320 --> 02:54:00.320
How's the tea, Mercy?

02:54:00.320 --> 02:54:02.320
I can't taste it because...

02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:10.320
because it's too hot.

02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:11.320
Still.

02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:34.320
I'm sure we're more than happy to get a fan game.

02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:45.320
But I'm pretty sure it's under, like, fan work?

02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:48.320
Fan work derivatives or something?

02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:50.320
Just double check it.

02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:52.320
Just double check it.

02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:57.320
All fan arts, of course, need to comply with the...

02:54:57.320 --> 02:54:58.320
with the...

02:54:58.320 --> 02:54:59.320
Oops.

02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:00.320
Ooh.

02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:02.320
I'm knocking things over.

02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:05.320
With the terms of services?

02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:09.320
Yeah.

02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:27.320
Sorry, just put on a lip balm.

02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:31.320
Ah, my lips get so dry.

02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:33.320
It's been so cold lately.

02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:40.320
Yeah, that's good tea.

02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:44.320
Okay.

02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:47.320
Let's continue.

02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:54.320
I struggle with dry lips myself.

02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:55.320
Uh, never seems to help.

02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:56.320
Okay.

02:55:57.320 --> 02:55:59.320
Um, I have this trouble, too.

02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:02.320
So the only thing that works for me are two...

02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:03.320
are three things.

02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:06.320
Um...

02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:11.320
Vaseline.

02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:17.320
Um, the specific lip gloss.

02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:23.320
And...

02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:26.320
Okay, this is gonna sound really weird.

02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:32.320
But this is a suggestion a lot of celebrities do.

02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:35.320
Which is nipple cream.

02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:38.320
Uh, nipple balm.

02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:39.320
Sorry, not nipple cream.

02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:40.320
Nipple balm.

02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:44.320
Because, uh, it's for...

02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:46.320
for, um...

02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:48.320
for mothers.

02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:50.320
When a child is feeding...

02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:54.320
feeding, um, the balm...

02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:59.320
the nipple can get really chapped and dry.

02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:01.320
And because the...

02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:03.320
the, um...

02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:10.320
the texture on the nipple is similar to lips.

02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:11.320
I guess.

02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:15.320
Um, a lot of celebrities use a...

02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:17.320
nipple balm...

02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:19.320
for their lips instead.

02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:24.320
Yeah, it hurts.

02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:25.320
It hurts.

02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:27.320
So, like, a lot of mothers will buy these nipple balms,

02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:28.320
and then they'll...

02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:30.320
they'll, uh, it helps with the...

02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:32.320
the peeling and the dryness and the pain

02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:34.320
and the sores from...

02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:36.320
from when a baby, uh...

02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:38.320
baby, uh, suckles.

02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:49.320
Yeah.

02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:53.320
Actually, you can literally probably go to any store

02:57:53.320 --> 02:57:55.320
and then they'll have it.

02:57:55.320 --> 02:57:56.320
They'll probably have it.

02:57:56.320 --> 02:57:58.320
Uh, I bought some.

02:57:58.320 --> 02:57:59.320
I bought some not too long ago

02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:01.320
because I had, like, really dry lips.

02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:04.320
Um, a lot of people say, uh,

02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:06.320
it lasts quite a long time.

02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:08.320
You only need a little bit.

02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:12.320
And I find that it doesn't dr...

02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:18.320
it doesn't go away as fast as the, um...

02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:20.320
as regular lip balm.

02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:22.320
It doesn't work for me, though,

02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:24.320
because I kind of have sensitive skin,

02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:27.320
so if it gets anywhere around the lip area,

02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:29.320
that's not on my lips.

02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:31.320
And it tends to, like, uh, that area

02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:33.320
tends to be, like, a little sensitive.

02:58:37.320 --> 02:58:40.320
So, um, let me...

02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:41.320
Okay, I know it's weird,

02:58:41.320 --> 02:58:42.320
but let me find...

02:58:42.320 --> 02:58:44.320
find, uh, it.

02:58:44.320 --> 02:58:45.320
I know it's weird.

02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:46.320
It's weird.

02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:48.320
It's weird, but I want to help.

02:58:48.320 --> 02:59:00.320
So, this is the one...

02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:04.320
I have.

02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:06.320
Let me try to find it.

02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:10.320
Here.

02:59:10.320 --> 02:59:12.320
Um...

02:59:12.320 --> 02:59:16.320
I'll show you.

02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:18.320
I'll show you.

02:59:18.320 --> 02:59:20.320
It does say cream on it,

02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:22.320
but it's more like a balm.

02:59:22.320 --> 02:59:23.320
It's more like a balm.

02:59:23.320 --> 02:59:25.320
It comes out like a Vaseline balm.

02:59:25.320 --> 02:59:33.320
It-a-ba-ba-ba-ba-neep balm cream.

02:59:33.320 --> 02:59:34.320
My skin's kind of sensitive,

02:59:34.320 --> 02:59:36.320
so it doesn't really work

02:59:36.320 --> 02:59:38.320
for the skin around it,

02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:40.320
but this is what I...

02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:41.320
I don't know.

02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:43.320
I don't know.

02:59:43.320 --> 02:59:45.320
It doesn't work the skin around it,

02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:48.320
but this is what I-I found to work.

02:59:48.320 --> 02:59:52.320
This-this one.

02:59:52.320 --> 02:59:53.320
Does it smell?

02:59:53.320 --> 02:59:55.320
I don't think it has a particular smell to it,

02:59:55.320 --> 02:59:57.320
especially because it's, uh,

02:59:57.320 --> 02:59:59.320
safe for babies to ingest as well,

02:59:59.320 --> 03:00:01.320
so I think it doesn't have

03:00:01.320 --> 03:00:03.320
any particular smell to it.

03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:13.320
So a lot of celebrities

03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:15.320
will use this instead of

03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:16.320
a regular lip balm

03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:21.320
because it's stronger.

03:00:21.320 --> 03:00:24.320
I think it comes in a-a different format now.

03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:26.320
I think it comes in a little jar.

03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:28.320
Jar, but when I bought it,

03:00:28.320 --> 03:00:32.320
it-it's-it's this-it's this little tube.

03:00:33.320 --> 03:00:35.320
But yeah, this is, like,

03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:37.320
if you have trouble finding lip balm,

03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:39.320
so, like, if regular lip balm doesn't work for you

03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:41.320
and, like, Vaseline doesn't work for you

03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:43.320
or anything, try this one.

03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:51.320
Try this.

03:00:51.320 --> 03:00:54.320
Like, legitimately, it-it-it will help with, uh,

03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:55.320
try it out.

03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:57.320
It's not too expensive either, I think.

03:00:57.320 --> 03:01:00.320
Uh, and it lasts forever.

03:01:00.320 --> 03:01:02.320
It lasts forever.

03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:12.320
How much per box?

03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:14.320
I bought it for around ten-

03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:16.320
I bought it for ten dollars,

03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:20.320
and it's a huge little tube, you know?

03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:24.320
It's about-it was about the size of my hand,

03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:26.320
but then again, my hands are-are a bit-

03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:30.320
or maybe different size.

03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:36.320
I'm not sure.

03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:38.320
I think it might be cheaper at certain places,

03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:41.320
but it's definitely something that-that people can use

03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:43.320
for their lips.

03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:48.320
For their lips instead of, um,

03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:50.320
instead of regular lip balm.

03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:52.320
Especially if it, uh...

03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:56.320
If it, if it, if it...

03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:00.320
Because, uh, let's be real,

03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:03.320
lip balm industry kind of sucks.

03:02:03.320 --> 03:02:05.320
They literally dry out your lips even more

03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:07.320
and so that you have to reapply it all the time.

03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:09.320
Kind of sucks that way.

03:02:16.320 --> 03:02:20.320
So, yeah, celebrities will use, uh, this little-

03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:23.320
for this-for lip balm instead.

03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:26.320
And since it's, uh, safe for babies to ingest,

03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:28.320
it should be safe on your lips

03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:30.320
and for you to ingest as well.

03:02:35.320 --> 03:02:37.320
So, um...

03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:40.320
Yeah, the brand I use normally

03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:43.320
that doesn't make my skin super sensitive,

03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:45.320
is if you have super sensitive skin,

03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:49.320
uh, the nipple-nipple cream might not work for you,

03:02:49.320 --> 03:02:51.320
so I just use Vaseline.

03:02:51.320 --> 03:02:53.320
I just use Vaseline.

03:02:53.320 --> 03:02:55.320
It works.

03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:07.320
Does-but does nipple balm come in a nice little container

03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:09.320
that fits also nicely in my pocket?

03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:14.320
Um, my advice for that is take a lip balm tin,

03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:17.320
like an empty lip balm tin,

03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:19.320
and just squeeze some in.

03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:32.320
Vaseline's the only thing that works for me.

03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:35.320
It's really s-it's-it's petroleum, so...

03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:42.320
Um, but, uh, I find the nipple-the nipple balm,

03:03:42.320 --> 03:03:44.320
like, it's-it's about the size of my hand.

03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:46.320
It actually fits in, like, purse and stuff really well.

03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:49.320
And if-well, if you're-you're a guy,

03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:51.320
you have pockets everywhere, it's gonna fit.

03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:53.320
Your pockets can fit in ten-Nintendo switches,

03:03:53.320 --> 03:03:55.320
so it's fine.

03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:07.320
But, like, if you have sensitive skin,

03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:09.320
um, try it out first.

03:04:09.320 --> 03:04:11.320
Like, try-it might work out for you.

03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:13.320
It didn't work for me,

03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:17.320
but I do use it in emergencies.

03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:21.320
Like, if my skin-my lip-the skin on my lip

03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:23.320
is so chapped it's, like, cutting,

03:04:23.320 --> 03:04:25.320
I will use the nipple balm.

03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:48.320
Cause, um, yeah, I suffer from-from dry skin,

03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:51.320
sensitive skin, mostly dry skin.

03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:55.320
My skin is super dry, so I need to moisturize a lot.

03:04:59.320 --> 03:05:02.320
Wait, Mercy, you can have a lip balm ASMR trigger.

03:05:02.320 --> 03:05:04.320
What does that mean?

03:05:04.320 --> 03:05:06.320
How do you do that?

03:05:07.320 --> 03:05:08.320
Thanks, Mercy.

03:05:08.320 --> 03:05:10.320
This has been extremely educational.

03:05:10.320 --> 03:05:13.320
Finally, some-maybe, finally,

03:05:13.320 --> 03:05:16.320
can get some soft lip-sci-cave.

03:05:16.320 --> 03:05:17.320
Yeah.

03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:19.320
Just dry skin or eczema.

03:05:19.320 --> 03:05:21.320
I don't have eczema, but I do have dry skin.

03:05:21.320 --> 03:05:24.320
Pretty dry skin, so my skin will get pretty flaky and stuff.

03:05:29.320 --> 03:05:31.320
That being-that was, like, what?

03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:33.320
Like, popping the lips like this?

03:05:33.320 --> 03:05:34.320
Like, like that?

03:05:34.320 --> 03:05:36.320
Is-is that a trigger?

03:05:40.320 --> 03:05:41.320
Really?

03:05:41.320 --> 03:05:42.320
What?

03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:43.320
It is?

03:05:43.320 --> 03:05:44.320
Oh, okay.

03:05:48.320 --> 03:05:50.320
Thanks for teaching me some pie.

03:05:56.320 --> 03:05:58.320
But yeah, I suffer from dry lips,

03:05:58.320 --> 03:06:00.320
so every once in a while during streams,

03:06:00.320 --> 03:06:02.320
I'll be like, uggh, if you see me go like,

03:06:02.320 --> 03:06:03.320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

03:06:03.320 --> 03:06:04.320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

03:06:04.320 --> 03:06:05.320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:06.320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

03:06:06.320 --> 03:06:07.320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

03:06:07.320 --> 03:06:08.320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

03:06:08.320 --> 03:06:09.320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

03:06:09.320 --> 03:06:11.320
uggh, if you see me go like, uggh,

03:06:11.320 --> 03:06:13.320
I'm putting on the bomb.

03:06:14.320 --> 03:06:17.320
Yeah, mercy my twin with the skin issues.

03:06:22.320 --> 03:06:25.320
But yeah, if-if-if everyone,

03:06:25.320 --> 03:06:27.320
if, like, Senpai suffer from dry lips,

03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:29.320
I have, like, tips-

03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:31.320
I have tips, so I have, like,

03:06:31.320 --> 03:06:33.320
I definitely use that one.

03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:36.320
Vaseline is my only go-to recently.

03:06:36.320 --> 03:06:38.320
Um...

03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:39.320
And then, for Vaseline,

03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:41.320
I just put it in, like, a little tin.

03:06:51.320 --> 03:06:52.320
You can also probably do the same thing.

03:06:52.320 --> 03:06:54.320
Wanted. What's the Wanted poster?

03:06:56.320 --> 03:06:59.320
Pluto, the ninth planet in the solar system.

03:06:59.320 --> 03:07:01.320
No reward, sorry.

03:07:02.320 --> 03:07:05.320
Huh?

03:07:05.320 --> 03:07:06.320
Faceless Missy.

03:07:06.320 --> 03:07:07.320
Huh? Faceless Missy again?

03:07:07.320 --> 03:07:09.320
It wasn't me this time, I promise.

03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:11.320
I'll leave me alone to repent.

03:07:15.320 --> 03:07:17.320
I'm gonna swing in the moon!

03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:21.320
Eh? There's a mirror here.

03:07:24.320 --> 03:07:26.320
A floating mirror.

03:07:26.320 --> 03:07:28.320
Your friends smile warmly behind you.

03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:31.320
That-that's cute.

03:07:33.320 --> 03:07:34.320
I think it flowers someone,

03:07:34.320 --> 03:07:35.320
but he's only interested in puzzles.

03:07:35.320 --> 03:07:36.320
If only I had a-

03:07:36.320 --> 03:07:38.320
I could find a flower puzzle or something.

03:07:38.320 --> 03:07:40.320
He would notice me.

03:07:41.320 --> 03:07:44.320
I wonder if there's a flower puzzle or something.

03:07:58.320 --> 03:08:00.320
How about you?

03:08:04.320 --> 03:08:06.320
Huh?

03:08:11.320 --> 03:08:13.320
Oh, I'm glad I could help my supplies.

03:08:13.320 --> 03:08:14.320
I know it's a weird-

03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:16.320
I know it's weird, especially if it's like-

03:08:16.320 --> 03:08:18.320
Hey, so, it's got to be around here somewhere.

03:08:18.320 --> 03:08:20.320
Especially since it's like,

03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:21.320
Oh, Violaur, the, uh, the,

03:08:21.320 --> 03:08:23.320
Hoo-hoo, company.

03:08:23.320 --> 03:08:25.320
Kind of sus company.

03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:30.320
Oh no, a flower!

03:08:30.320 --> 03:08:32.320
It's flowers! They're already dying!

03:08:32.320 --> 03:08:34.320
Do your best to take care of them until Basel gets back.

03:08:36.320 --> 03:08:38.320
Would you like to water the plants?

03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:40.320
Yeah, of course!

03:08:46.320 --> 03:08:48.320
Oh!

03:08:48.320 --> 03:08:50.320
How do I...

03:08:58.320 --> 03:09:00.320
How do I water them?

03:09:02.320 --> 03:09:04.320
Wait, how do I water them?

03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:06.320
Is water the voted ones?

03:09:06.320 --> 03:09:08.320
Okay.

03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:10.320
Well, these are lilies of the valley, so they probably just look like that, huh?

03:09:14.320 --> 03:09:16.320
Okay, well...

03:09:20.320 --> 03:09:22.320
Cacti probably won't die.

03:09:30.320 --> 03:09:32.320
Cacti probably won't die.

03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:36.320
Tulips are fine.

03:09:44.320 --> 03:09:46.320
Ma, are you here?

03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:48.320
Get some delicious fruits?

03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:06.320
Cacti probably won't die.

03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:14.320
Wipe your feet, everyone!

03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:16.320
Ugh, fuck are you!

03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:26.320
Oh, there doesn't seem anything out of the ordinary.

03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:30.320
You think Basel just left somewhere without telling us?

03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:32.320
I don't know, that doesn't sound like him.

03:10:34.320 --> 03:10:36.320
He's usually so considerate about these things.

03:10:38.320 --> 03:10:40.320
Guys, I'm really worried. There's nothing we can do?

03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:42.320
We can't find him!

03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:44.320
What if he's in danger?

03:10:44.320 --> 03:10:46.320
They come, Aubrey.

03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:48.320
I'm worried too, but that won't solve anything.

03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:50.320
He won't slug around the forest.

03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:52.320
Maybe he wandered off and got lost.

03:10:52.320 --> 03:10:54.320
Yeah, cheer up, Aubrey!

03:10:54.320 --> 03:10:56.320
We'll find Basel.

03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:00.320
You guys are right.

03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:02.320
Okay, we gotta keep our hopes up.

03:11:02.320 --> 03:11:04.320
Let's look for Basel in the Vast for it.

03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:08.320
What is that?

03:11:10.320 --> 03:11:12.320
Fireplace is burning.

03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:14.320
It just says Basel left it.

03:11:14.320 --> 03:11:16.320
Look, case.

03:11:16.320 --> 03:11:18.320
It's a little dusty.

03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:20.320
Ah, ah, ah!

03:11:20.320 --> 03:11:22.320
Achoo!

03:11:28.320 --> 03:11:30.320
I guess we gotta kill these dust bunnies.

03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:34.320
Let's go!

03:11:38.320 --> 03:11:40.320
Never mind, we're fine!

03:11:50.320 --> 03:11:52.320
Comfortable looking bed.

03:11:54.320 --> 03:11:56.320
Small plants, they look a little sad.

03:11:56.320 --> 03:11:58.320
Okay, well, I guess we gotta go find.

03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:02.320
Go find Basel.

03:12:08.320 --> 03:12:10.320
I know we killed the dust bunny,

03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:12.320
but I'm like, ah, ah, ah!

03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:14.320
Well...

03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:16.320
Yes!

03:12:18.320 --> 03:12:20.320
Stomped out of existence.

03:12:20.320 --> 03:12:22.320
Personally, I don't like dust bunnies either.

03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:24.320
I guess we'll find Basel.

03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:26.320
Personally, I don't like dust bunnies either.

03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:28.320
They make me sneeze.

03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:30.320
I don't like sneezing.

03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:46.320
We're going this way.

03:12:50.320 --> 03:12:52.320
Fast forest.

03:12:54.320 --> 03:12:56.320
We're going this way.

03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:14.320
There's a parrot, I think.

03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:20.320
Basel!

03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:22.320
Basel, where are you?

03:13:24.320 --> 03:13:26.320
I know.

03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:28.320
I bet my pet rock will know what to do.

03:13:28.320 --> 03:13:30.320
Heck, there'll be a good boy.

03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:32.320
Go find Basel.

03:13:42.320 --> 03:13:44.320
Try your best, buddy.

03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:48.320
This is no time to fool around, Cal.

03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:50.320
Hey, why you?

03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:52.320
Pector was just trying to help.

03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:54.320
I call you two.

03:13:54.320 --> 03:13:56.320
We need to keep ourselves focused.

03:14:02.320 --> 03:14:04.320
Squawk!

03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:06.320
Main station.

03:14:06.320 --> 03:14:08.320
Squawk! Squawk!

03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:10.320
Body bridge.

03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:20.320
Your voice is really nice to listen to.

03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:24.320
You say that as I literally squawk.

03:14:42.320 --> 03:14:44.320
Kill the bunny.

03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:46.320
Oh no, it winked.

03:14:48.320 --> 03:14:50.320
Oh no, it winked.

03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:20.320
We won!

03:15:38.320 --> 03:15:40.320
Yay, we won!

03:15:40.320 --> 03:15:42.320
We won!

03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:48.320
We got stuff.

03:15:50.320 --> 03:15:52.320
There's those.

03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:54.320
Got both of them.

03:15:56.320 --> 03:15:58.320
Ah, give me a second.

03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:04.320
Got bracelet.

03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:06.320
Okay.

03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:08.320
And now I can fight this bunny in.

03:16:08.320 --> 03:16:10.320
Go!

03:16:10.320 --> 03:16:12.320
Fight bunny!

03:16:12.320 --> 03:16:14.320
Die!

03:16:16.320 --> 03:16:18.320
No, not the bunny link.

03:16:18.320 --> 03:16:20.320
I can do that too.

03:16:20.320 --> 03:16:22.320
Hold on.

03:16:22.320 --> 03:16:24.320
Pempie, are you ready?

03:16:38.320 --> 03:16:40.320
Okay.

03:16:58.320 --> 03:17:00.320
Got life cam.

03:17:02.320 --> 03:17:06.320
Let's quickly grab stuff.

03:17:06.320 --> 03:17:08.320
Let's get a bottle of juice.

03:17:16.320 --> 03:17:18.320
Oh.

03:17:26.320 --> 03:17:28.320
That over here, right?

03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:38.320
Hmm. I don't know, guys.

03:17:38.320 --> 03:17:40.320
I think Basel's in this forest.

03:17:40.320 --> 03:17:42.320
We haven't searched the whole forest yet.

03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:44.320
Can't stop now.

03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:46.320
Cheer up, Aubrey.

03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:48.320
We'll keep searching until we find them.

03:17:48.320 --> 03:17:50.320
We don't find Basel soon.

03:17:50.320 --> 03:17:52.320
Maybe we should meet up with Mari and the playground

03:17:52.320 --> 03:17:54.320
and figure out what to do from there.

03:17:54.320 --> 03:17:56.320
Bridge, right?

03:18:00.320 --> 03:18:02.320
There it is.

03:18:02.320 --> 03:18:04.320
Bee.

03:18:06.320 --> 03:18:08.320
10 keys left.

03:18:12.320 --> 03:18:14.320
Between giant pinwheels.

03:18:22.320 --> 03:18:24.320
Hold on.

03:18:36.320 --> 03:18:38.320
I don't know what to do.

03:18:38.320 --> 03:18:40.320
Oh, we're here.

03:18:40.320 --> 03:18:42.320
It's a good idea.

03:18:42.320 --> 03:18:44.320
We'll be back.

03:18:44.320 --> 03:18:46.320
It's a good idea.

03:18:46.320 --> 03:18:48.320
Let's go.

03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:50.320
We're here!

03:18:50.320 --> 03:18:52.320
Come on.

03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:54.320
Let's go.

03:18:54.320 --> 03:18:56.320
Let's go.

03:18:56.320 --> 03:18:58.320
Come on.

03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:00.320
Come on.

03:19:00.320 --> 03:19:02.320
Come on.

03:19:02.320 --> 03:19:04.320
Come on.

03:19:04.320 --> 03:19:06.320
Come on.

03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:08.320
Come on.

03:19:08.320 --> 03:19:10.320
Come on.

03:19:10.320 --> 03:19:12.320
Come on.

03:19:14.320 --> 03:19:16.320
Come on.

03:19:16.320 --> 03:19:18.320
Come on.

03:19:30.320 --> 03:19:32.320
Come on.

03:19:32.320 --> 03:19:34.320
Come on.

03:19:34.320 --> 03:20:02.920
I might go back because I'm just like oh

03:20:02.920 --> 03:20:10.040
I just have Michael back because I didn't

03:20:10.040 --> 03:20:15.280
explore that entire areola yet and I'm

03:20:15.280 --> 03:20:17.960
kind of a type of player who wants to

03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:19.560
complete everything

03:20:20.180 --> 03:20:23.520
gosh

03:20:39.040 --> 03:20:45.440
I gotta revive us again

03:20:49.560 --> 03:20:53.560
Why is this bunny so fricking strong?!

03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:14.560
No! Not another toast!

03:21:19.560 --> 03:21:21.560
Okay, good, we stabbed it.

03:21:28.560 --> 03:21:30.560
Well, that's a problem.

03:21:49.560 --> 03:21:51.560
Whee! Whee! Whee!

03:21:55.560 --> 03:21:57.560
I gotta run, bye.

03:22:06.560 --> 03:22:08.560
Whoa!

03:22:09.560 --> 03:22:11.560
No, don't touch me!

03:22:12.560 --> 03:22:14.560
Don't, don't, don't!

03:22:15.560 --> 03:22:18.560
Don't touch me, not yet!

03:22:19.560 --> 03:22:21.560
Don't touch me, not yet!

03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:29.560
What the?

03:22:33.560 --> 03:22:36.560
Hello everyone, how's it going? Have you found Basel yet?

03:22:37.560 --> 03:22:39.560
Hey Mari, not look so far I'm afraid.

03:22:40.560 --> 03:22:44.560
Oh, I'm sorry guys. Sarah was the way I could help more.

03:22:45.560 --> 03:22:49.560
We're all doing our best, maybe we should start looking outside this forest.

03:22:51.560 --> 03:22:54.560
I know, why don't we try climbing a really long ladder?

03:22:55.560 --> 03:22:57.560
East, one east of the stump.

03:22:58.560 --> 03:23:00.560
Dude, that'll Mari's afraid of heights.

03:23:01.560 --> 03:23:04.560
What if Basel somewhere up there? We gotta take her chances.

03:23:05.560 --> 03:23:07.560
I know, but...

03:23:09.560 --> 03:23:11.560
Oh boy, growing stronger and stronger every day.

03:23:11.560 --> 03:23:14.560
You kind of keep climbing a ladder, can't you?

03:23:15.560 --> 03:23:17.560
Come on little brother, face your fears.

03:23:18.560 --> 03:23:21.560
It's natural to be nervous at first, but you should know that, we all believe in you.

03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:25.560
Come on now Mari, just one measly little ladder.

03:23:26.560 --> 03:23:28.560
No worries that can happen.

03:23:29.560 --> 03:23:30.560
I'm not about this.

03:23:31.560 --> 03:23:32.560
Are you here to be okay? Oh Mari?

03:23:33.560 --> 03:23:34.560
No.

03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:36.560
Okay, just take your time.

03:23:37.560 --> 03:23:39.560
Come on now Mari, you can't just sit tight with Basel missing.

03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:40.560
Mari, we have to do this.

03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:42.560
I'm here to support you.

03:23:43.560 --> 03:23:45.560
If anything happens, we'll be all here to protect you too.

03:23:46.560 --> 03:23:47.560
Won't we all agree?

03:23:48.560 --> 03:23:50.560
No, I guess you're right about that.

03:23:51.560 --> 03:23:53.560
Have nothing to be afraid of as long as we're together.

03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:56.560
Basel's probably all alone. He needs us right now.

03:23:58.560 --> 03:24:00.560
Mari, you need to face your fears for Basel's sake.

03:24:01.560 --> 03:24:02.560
I believe in you.

03:24:03.560 --> 03:24:05.560
Take it slow if you like, as long as we get there eventually.

03:24:06.560 --> 03:24:07.560
Woohoo!

03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:09.560
Let's go, let's go to the ladder east of the stump.

03:24:11.560 --> 03:24:12.560
I'll see you later Mari.

03:24:13.560 --> 03:24:14.560
I know.

03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:16.560
Stay safe.

03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:18.560
Remember oh Mari, you're stronger than you think.

03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:21.560
Give me a second.

03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:23.560
Yeah, nutritious candy.

03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:31.560
I'll probably save as well.

03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:33.560
I yapped so much.

03:24:35.560 --> 03:24:36.560
I yapped so much.

03:24:37.560 --> 03:24:38.560
Hahaha.

03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:46.560
Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:49.560
Hey man, something wrong with Burley?

03:24:50.560 --> 03:24:51.560
Seems a little upset.

03:24:54.560 --> 03:24:55.560
Oh, about that well you see.

03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:00.560
Let me explain.

03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:02.560
Look at this pole.

03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:04.560
Can't you believe it?

03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:06.560
There's no tether ball?

03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:09.560
What are we looking at?

03:25:10.560 --> 03:25:11.560
Yeah, I don't see it.

03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:15.560
Exactly!

03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:17.560
The tether ball is missing.

03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:20.560
And you used his arm and swung it too hard.

03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:22.560
Now the ball has gone off somewhere.

03:25:24.560 --> 03:25:25.560
Never to be seen again.

03:25:26.560 --> 03:25:28.560
I thought you didn't have to use your arms man.

03:25:29.560 --> 03:25:30.560
I'm gonna use your head.

03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:32.560
Like this.

03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:34.560
Sorry Burley.

03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:36.560
Using my head.

03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:38.560
All the time gives me a headache.

03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:41.560
That's because you don't have a hard head like I do.

03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:44.560
Oh, something just hit me.

03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:47.560
I'm sure I saw the ball flying off somewhere in that direction.

03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:53.560
Into the vast, into the vast forest?

03:25:54.560 --> 03:25:55.560
Never find it now.

03:25:56.560 --> 03:25:57.560
Things will be lost forever.

03:25:58.560 --> 03:25:59.560
I don't smell it Burley.

03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:01.560
We'll find it's ball for you.

03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:03.560
Yeah, be sure you want to do that.

03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:05.560
Fast forward to pretty good use place you know.

03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:12.560
One time, game gun just super gizzy brawl with this ugly pint creature with dead empty eyes and a gaping mouth.

03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:14.560
I outroided it.

03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:16.560
Of course, being cool and smart and all.

03:26:17.560 --> 03:26:19.560
There's no monster in all the universe that can't outrun me.

03:26:22.560 --> 03:26:23.560
What?

03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:28.560
Hey Elmore, why don't you try?

03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:31.560
You and your friends go with Burley and keep her out of trouble.

03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:33.560
I'll go myself, but...

03:26:35.560 --> 03:26:36.560
Man!

03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:39.560
Be all right, I'll be my beings again.

03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:42.560
Oh geez, there's my cue.

03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:44.560
I'm coming happy.

03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:46.560
You safe out there guys.

03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:48.560
See you when you get back.

03:26:50.560 --> 03:26:51.560
Come on Burley.

03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:53.560
Come on Burley, let's go find your lost ball.

03:26:54.560 --> 03:26:56.560
You don't have anything to worry about as long as we're together.

03:26:57.560 --> 03:26:58.560
I can't share.

03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:01.560
Just don't get in my way when I show off my totally amazing headbutt skills.

03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:04.560
Let's just get this over with.

03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:07.560
Burley joined your party.

03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:17.560
I guess I'm a little bad because where would my shop please buy something like this?

03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:20.560
I'm gonna get some candy.

03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:23.560
Maybe six candies.

03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:26.560
So I can...

03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:28.560
Heal up.

03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:32.560
What the heck happened over here?

03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:39.560
Rows ran over me and knocked me down, but I'm just lying here because it feels good.

03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:48.560
Oh no, thanks.

03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:50.560
Thanks, you're gonna be okay.

03:27:55.560 --> 03:27:56.560
Is this anywhere in my last moment?

03:27:57.560 --> 03:27:58.560
Is this somewhere else to be or something?

03:27:58.560 --> 03:27:59.560
No.

03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:02.560
Okay, I will go get your lost ball.

03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:06.560
Oh, don't forget to use Hero's Healing Skill.

03:28:06.560 --> 03:28:07.560
Oh yeah, I forgot.

03:28:08.560 --> 03:28:09.560
I forgot.

03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:15.560
It's not this way, is it?

03:28:17.560 --> 03:28:18.560
Squawk!

03:28:18.560 --> 03:28:19.560
In the Meal Forest.

03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:20.560
Squawk, Squawk!

03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:21.560
Longy Bridge.

03:28:21.560 --> 03:28:22.560
Longy Bridge.

03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:33.560
Where's this?

03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:46.560
Okay.

03:28:46.560 --> 03:28:47.560
Okay.

03:28:50.560 --> 03:28:51.560
I guess not.

03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:54.560
I'll come here soon.

03:28:54.560 --> 03:28:55.560
Oops, I ran into a bunny.

03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:17.560
Okay.

03:29:44.560 --> 03:29:45.560
Hi, guys.

03:29:46.560 --> 03:29:47.560
It's a bunny.

03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:01.560
Bye bye, bunny.

03:30:16.560 --> 03:30:17.560
There we go.

03:30:18.560 --> 03:30:19.560
Okay, we got it.

03:30:47.560 --> 03:30:48.560
Where's my...

03:30:49.560 --> 03:30:50.560
Kit?

03:30:51.560 --> 03:30:52.560
Snacks? Tofu?

03:30:54.560 --> 03:30:56.560
Here, I'll put Candy on.

03:30:57.560 --> 03:30:58.560
Girl?

03:30:58.560 --> 03:30:59.560
There you go.

03:31:00.560 --> 03:31:01.560
All better.

03:31:07.560 --> 03:31:08.560
What's over here?

03:31:09.560 --> 03:31:10.560
Huh?

03:31:12.560 --> 03:31:13.560
It's the tire swing.

03:31:19.560 --> 03:31:21.560
Alright, we'll kill him again.

03:31:38.560 --> 03:31:41.560
Quickly kill the sprout thing.

03:32:09.560 --> 03:32:10.560
Huh?

03:32:27.560 --> 03:32:28.560
Eh.

03:32:28.560 --> 03:32:29.560
Hmm?

03:32:38.560 --> 03:32:40.560
Some pies need another wink?

03:32:46.560 --> 03:32:47.560
I patch on, wink.

03:32:59.560 --> 03:33:00.560
Sorry.

03:33:00.560 --> 03:33:02.560
Bunny, can you wait?

03:33:18.560 --> 03:33:19.560
There we go.

03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:33.560
I can't remember what the weaknesses were.

03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:55.560
Like, angry over sad, okay.

03:33:58.560 --> 03:33:59.560
Be stronger than sad.

03:34:00.560 --> 03:34:01.560
Sad, stronger than him.

03:34:02.560 --> 03:34:03.560
Okay.

03:34:05.560 --> 03:34:08.560
Eh, we'll make this dish sad.

03:34:11.560 --> 03:34:12.560
Hopefully.

03:34:28.560 --> 03:34:29.560
Okay.

03:34:49.560 --> 03:34:51.560
I think Omlauri has stronger...

03:34:52.560 --> 03:34:53.560
...stronger attack.

03:34:58.560 --> 03:34:59.560
Okay.

03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:17.560
There we go.

03:35:23.560 --> 03:35:24.560
There we go.

03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:26.560
We just managed to offball.

03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:27.560
Oh.

03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:29.560
There we go.

03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:39.560
There we go.

03:35:42.560 --> 03:35:44.560
I'm starting to get the hang of it.

03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:45.560
Yepa.

03:35:49.560 --> 03:35:51.560
Oh, I'm probably gonna heal again.

03:35:55.560 --> 03:35:56.560
I hate eggs.

03:35:56.560 --> 03:35:57.560
I hate stepping on eggs.

03:35:57.560 --> 03:36:00.560
I think the possibility of even stepping on eggs is disgusting.

03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:23.560
Okay, where's that tether ball?

03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:25.560
Yeah, Jax.

03:36:32.560 --> 03:36:33.560
Not over here.

03:36:36.560 --> 03:36:38.560
I say totally avoiding...

03:36:40.560 --> 03:36:41.560
...rain station.

03:36:54.560 --> 03:36:56.560
Hi, I'm the wise rock.

03:36:56.560 --> 03:36:57.560
I'll give you solid advice.

03:36:57.560 --> 03:36:58.560
It can exchange for clams.

03:36:58.560 --> 03:36:59.560
Kind of vice.

03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:03.560
Would you like me to give good advice?

03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:05.560
Okay, advice.

03:37:05.560 --> 03:37:06.560
Bad advice.

03:37:06.560 --> 03:37:07.560
Okay.

03:37:07.560 --> 03:37:09.560
And everyone wants...

03:37:09.560 --> 03:37:10.560
...wants an okay...

03:37:10.560 --> 03:37:11.560
...good advice, right?

03:37:14.560 --> 03:37:16.560
How bad is your egg allergy?

03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:18.560
Like, have a pen handy?

03:37:19.560 --> 03:37:21.560
You guys wanna give a bad advice?

03:37:21.560 --> 03:37:22.560
Okay.

03:37:25.560 --> 03:37:26.560
Let's see.

03:37:26.560 --> 03:37:27.560
I have...

03:37:27.560 --> 03:37:29.560
My allergy is pretty bad.

03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:30.560
Like, if I touch it...

03:37:31.560 --> 03:37:33.560
...my throat constricts and stuff,

03:37:33.560 --> 03:37:35.560
I don't need an FD pen.

03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:39.560
I usually, if I have the first sign...

03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:41.560
...of the allergy coming,

03:37:41.560 --> 03:37:43.560
I will use Benadryl.

03:37:44.560 --> 03:37:46.560
But if I eat too much...

03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:48.560
...or ingest eggs too much,

03:37:48.560 --> 03:37:50.560
I will need to be hospitalized.

03:37:51.560 --> 03:37:54.560
So, yeah, that's...

03:37:54.560 --> 03:37:56.560
I'm pretty allergic.

03:37:56.560 --> 03:37:57.560
What is...

03:37:57.560 --> 03:37:58.560
What is my...

03:37:58.560 --> 03:38:00.560
If you look up a certain thing,

03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:02.560
let me see what it's called again.

03:38:03.560 --> 03:38:04.560
Let me see something.

03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:05.560
What it's called again.

03:38:05.560 --> 03:38:06.560
Yeah.

03:38:51.560 --> 03:38:52.560
Ah, okay.

03:38:53.560 --> 03:38:54.560
My allergy...

03:38:55.560 --> 03:38:56.560
What happens?

03:38:57.560 --> 03:38:58.560
Is called...

03:38:59.560 --> 03:39:00.560
Angio...

03:39:01.560 --> 03:39:03.560
Angioedema.

03:39:05.560 --> 03:39:06.560
But it's...

03:39:06.560 --> 03:39:07.560
It's worse for me,

03:39:07.560 --> 03:39:09.560
because my throat actually swells as well.

03:39:10.560 --> 03:39:11.560
So then I can't breathe.

03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:13.560
So...

03:39:13.560 --> 03:39:14.560
I have...

03:39:14.560 --> 03:39:15.560
I have...

03:39:15.560 --> 03:39:16.560
I have...

03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:17.560
I have...

03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:18.560
I have...

03:39:18.560 --> 03:39:19.560
I have...

03:39:19.560 --> 03:39:20.560
I have...

03:39:20.560 --> 03:39:22.560
So I get swollen eyes.

03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:24.560
Swollen lips.

03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:26.560
Swollen tongue.

03:39:26.560 --> 03:39:28.560
And my throat gets swollen as well.

03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:31.560
So then I can't breathe.

03:39:31.560 --> 03:39:33.560
Then I have to go to the hospital.

03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:37.560
So...

03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:38.560
If...

03:39:38.560 --> 03:39:40.560
To have a visual...

03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:42.560
Um...

03:39:43.560 --> 03:39:45.560
Visual of what I will look like.

03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:46.560
Just think of how...

03:39:46.560 --> 03:39:47.560
How Pepe...

03:39:47.560 --> 03:39:49.560
Pepe the frog looks.

03:39:49.560 --> 03:39:51.560
I will look exactly like that.

03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:07.560
But, um...

03:40:07.560 --> 03:40:09.560
Sorry, I keep on falling asleep.

03:40:09.560 --> 03:40:11.560
My motto keeps on falling asleep.

03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:18.560
Uh, eggs are everywhere in most foods, basically.

03:40:18.560 --> 03:40:20.560
Does this mean you have a...

03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:21.560
A specified diet?

03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:22.560
Uh...

03:40:22.560 --> 03:40:24.560
I eat mostly vegan.

03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:26.560
Mostly vegan.

03:40:27.560 --> 03:40:28.560
Um...

03:40:29.560 --> 03:40:30.560
Unfortunately.

03:40:31.560 --> 03:40:33.560
It's like vegan, but not by choice.

03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:37.560
Do you like the taste of eggs?

03:40:37.560 --> 03:40:40.560
I've never even tasted eggs in my entire life.

03:40:49.560 --> 03:40:51.560
Can't eat mayo either?

03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:53.560
No, I can't have mayo.

03:40:53.560 --> 03:40:55.560
Oh, but recently, um...

03:40:55.560 --> 03:40:56.560
How...

03:40:56.560 --> 03:40:57.560
How...

03:40:57.560 --> 03:40:58.560
How many...

03:40:58.560 --> 03:41:01.560
How many have made a vegan mayo?

03:41:01.560 --> 03:41:03.560
Which, apparently, according to my...

03:41:03.560 --> 03:41:05.560
My gal pals...

03:41:05.560 --> 03:41:06.560
It tastes...

03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:08.560
It tastes exactly like mayo.

03:41:08.560 --> 03:41:11.560
So I've been using that recently for my sandwiches.

03:41:12.560 --> 03:41:13.560
Hahahaha!

03:41:16.560 --> 03:41:17.560
I, um...

03:41:17.560 --> 03:41:21.560
Only, I feel like, within like the past few years...

03:41:21.560 --> 03:41:24.560
Was like when things started, uh...

03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:27.560
People have started to accept like vegan as like...

03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:28.560
As like a...

03:41:28.560 --> 03:41:30.560
It started to be more of a trendy diet.

03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:31.560
Uh...

03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:34.560
Like, I tried...

03:41:35.560 --> 03:41:37.560
A cake for the first time.

03:41:37.560 --> 03:41:39.560
Like a moist cake.

03:41:39.560 --> 03:41:41.560
For the first time in adulthood.

03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:45.560
Hahahaha!

03:41:49.560 --> 03:41:51.560
Now, which has got any...

03:41:51.560 --> 03:41:53.560
Favorite kind of bread?

03:41:57.560 --> 03:42:01.560
I don't know, I think bread is usually pretty safe.

03:42:01.560 --> 03:42:02.560
Hahahaha!

03:42:10.560 --> 03:42:12.560
But, uh, I tested it.

03:42:12.560 --> 03:42:14.560
Uh, I think it's only bird eggs.

03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:16.560
I've never tried lizard eggs.

03:42:16.560 --> 03:42:18.560
And I'm a little too scared to try, but...

03:42:18.560 --> 03:42:19.560
Um...

03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:21.560
Mama!

03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:23.560
In my youth.

03:42:23.560 --> 03:42:26.560
I've been allergic to eggs since I was born.

03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:28.560
So, um...

03:42:29.560 --> 03:42:30.560
So...

03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:37.560
Mama! Mama tried to give me a quail egg.

03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:39.560
And that didn't go well either.

03:42:39.560 --> 03:42:40.560
And I tried duck egg.

03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:42.560
And I went to the hospital as well.

03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:45.560
So, I'm pretty sure all kinds of bird eggs are bad.

03:42:51.560 --> 03:42:53.560
And I've even tried balut.

03:42:53.560 --> 03:42:55.560
But, uh...

03:42:55.560 --> 03:42:57.560
I also died from that.

03:42:57.560 --> 03:42:58.560
So, something...

03:42:58.560 --> 03:43:00.560
Something about eggs, bad.

03:43:02.560 --> 03:43:05.560
So, I've been to the hospital several times.

03:43:06.560 --> 03:43:07.560
Fish eggs are fine.

03:43:07.560 --> 03:43:09.560
I don't know why, but fish eggs are fine.

03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:15.560
Mama tried to kill you if she tried.

03:43:15.560 --> 03:43:17.560
Um, let's just say I...

03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:21.560
It wasn't until a long time into my childhood

03:43:21.560 --> 03:43:23.560
that I, um...

03:43:24.560 --> 03:43:28.560
That the doctors have finally found out that I was allergic to eggs.

03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:38.560
So, I was kind of like force fed.

03:43:38.560 --> 03:43:40.560
And like eggs for a while.

03:43:40.560 --> 03:43:42.560
A lot, um...

03:43:42.560 --> 03:43:44.560
Oh, this is gonna sound bad.

03:43:44.560 --> 03:43:45.560
I was...

03:43:46.560 --> 03:43:48.560
I was punished a lot.

03:43:49.560 --> 03:43:50.560
In my youth.

03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:53.560
Especially by relatives.

03:43:53.560 --> 03:43:55.560
I was punished a lot in my youth.

03:43:57.560 --> 03:43:59.560
Because they all thought I was just a picky eater.

03:44:06.560 --> 03:44:08.560
Then they punished you by mail.

03:44:08.560 --> 03:44:10.560
They punished force feeding me.

03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:12.560
It's...

03:44:12.560 --> 03:44:14.560
It was pretty much child abuse.

03:44:17.560 --> 03:44:18.560
And, uh...

03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:20.560
Other methods.

03:44:21.560 --> 03:44:24.560
But I would always say to my parents,

03:44:24.560 --> 03:44:25.560
like, it hurts to eat.

03:44:25.560 --> 03:44:26.560
It hurts to eat.

03:44:26.560 --> 03:44:28.560
And they didn't get it.

03:44:28.560 --> 03:44:30.560
They didn't get it.

03:44:35.560 --> 03:44:38.560
They just thought I was a picky eater.

03:44:45.560 --> 03:44:48.560
But it wasn't until, I guess,

03:44:48.560 --> 03:44:51.560
when I was almost nearing pre-teens,

03:44:51.560 --> 03:44:53.560
where the doctors were like,

03:44:53.560 --> 03:44:57.560
we found out why you're hospitalized all the time.

03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:02.560
Hahaha.

03:45:09.560 --> 03:45:10.560
But it's fine now.

03:45:10.560 --> 03:45:11.560
It's fine now.

03:45:11.560 --> 03:45:15.560
Now I know what I'm allergic to and now...

03:45:15.560 --> 03:45:17.560
and what to avoid.

03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:19.560
So, yeah.

03:45:19.560 --> 03:45:21.560
Hahaha.

03:45:21.560 --> 03:45:31.500
I probably thought it was healthy back then, but no, definitely they're like, okay, no,

03:45:31.500 --> 03:45:35.620
no, no, no, no, you're not gonna get this because I definitely, when they force fed

03:45:35.620 --> 03:45:43.620
me to eat things, it was like hospitalized afterwards all the time.

03:45:43.620 --> 03:45:52.620
Oops, it's fine now, don't worry.

03:45:52.620 --> 03:46:00.620
Childhood trauma, nobody can trauma dump on me, I trauma dump on everyone else.

03:46:14.620 --> 03:46:28.620
But yeah, my sister definitely ran away because my parents are definitely overbearing.

03:46:28.620 --> 03:46:38.620
They are definitely overbearing, but they do love us.

03:46:38.620 --> 03:46:46.620
They do love us, trust me, I know.

03:46:46.620 --> 03:46:53.620
And I think they relaxed quite a bit, they relaxed quite a bit.

03:46:53.620 --> 03:47:02.620
When I was in school though, they were very strict, they were very, very strict.

03:47:02.620 --> 03:47:08.620
They were very strict, but then now I feel kind of weird.

03:47:08.620 --> 03:47:18.620
I kind of feel kind of weird because now I have a lot of freedom and I don't get in trouble as much anymore.

03:47:18.620 --> 03:47:24.620
Or even at all, I don't really get in trouble at all.

03:47:24.620 --> 03:47:31.620
So it kind of feels weird suddenly gaining all this freedom.

03:47:31.620 --> 03:47:33.620
I guess.

03:47:33.620 --> 03:47:41.620
My sister ran away sort of like the moment she was able to, when she graduated high school, she was like,

03:47:41.620 --> 03:47:48.620
okay, I'm going to study right now, bye.

03:47:48.620 --> 03:47:50.620
Do you like it, do you miss it?

03:47:50.620 --> 03:47:56.620
The kind of strangulating strictness, not really.

03:47:56.620 --> 03:48:00.620
It just still feels weird, does that make sense?

03:48:00.620 --> 03:48:03.620
It just feels strange.

03:48:03.620 --> 03:48:10.620
Because you know, my entire life was like, I was brought up pretty strictly,

03:48:10.620 --> 03:48:22.620
and then now it's just like, oh okay, you're an adult now, feel free to do whatever you want.

03:48:22.620 --> 03:48:26.620
What made the change happen?

03:48:26.620 --> 03:48:28.620
I don't know.

03:48:29.620 --> 03:48:40.620
I guess when I, when, I guess it's at the time they were like, well, here you go.

03:48:47.620 --> 03:48:51.620
Freedom's nice, you guys don't get that right though.

03:48:51.620 --> 03:48:57.620
At least I don't get that right.

03:48:57.620 --> 03:49:06.620
I guess, I guess like, they were just like, oh, you're done school now?

03:49:06.620 --> 03:49:09.620
Do whatever you want.

03:49:09.620 --> 03:49:13.620
But then I guess, I don't know, I guess in a way they were overbearing,

03:49:13.620 --> 03:49:19.620
but now they're begging me not to leave.

03:49:19.620 --> 03:49:26.620
I guess that makes sense.

03:49:27.620 --> 03:49:30.620
Yeah.

03:49:39.620 --> 03:49:46.620
But like I said earlier in stream, when I had an internship in Japan,

03:49:46.620 --> 03:49:51.620
I had an internship in Japan, I moved to Japan for three months,

03:49:51.620 --> 03:49:56.620
and I was telling Mama and Papa like, oh yeah, if I get a job there,

03:49:56.620 --> 03:50:00.620
I might, I might, you know, I might move, I might move here.

03:50:00.620 --> 03:50:04.620
And they said, you're moving to Japan? Okay, we're gonna come too.

03:50:04.620 --> 03:50:19.620
They were like, they were so adamant.

03:50:19.620 --> 03:50:21.620
And I was like, oh, I don't know, like maybe.

03:50:21.620 --> 03:50:24.620
And they were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we'll get a house with you.

03:50:24.620 --> 03:50:27.620
We'll get a house with you and we'll move in.

03:50:27.620 --> 03:50:30.620
We'll move in together as a family.

03:50:34.620 --> 03:50:54.620
I mean, they've already said to me like, if I ever move to Europe,

03:50:54.620 --> 03:50:56.620
they want to come with me.

03:50:56.620 --> 03:50:58.620
If I ever move to like Australia, they'll come with me.

03:50:58.620 --> 03:51:08.620
If I move to the US, they'll come with me.

03:51:08.620 --> 03:51:10.620
They'll come with me.

03:51:39.620 --> 03:51:41.620
Man, I'm so stupid.

03:51:54.620 --> 03:51:59.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, everyone lives in my basement.

03:51:59.620 --> 03:52:07.620
I think, I think I might have been easy to figure it out.

03:52:07.620 --> 03:52:10.620
Oops.

03:52:10.620 --> 03:52:13.620
Oh, whatever.

03:52:13.620 --> 03:52:16.620
Oh, whatever.

03:52:16.620 --> 03:52:22.620
Wow, got sad with the bag.

03:52:22.620 --> 03:52:31.620
Anyways, yeah.

03:52:31.620 --> 03:52:47.620
Yeah, they wanted to stick around all the times, I guess.

03:52:47.620 --> 03:52:50.620
My bad.

03:52:50.620 --> 03:52:53.620
So yeah, they definitely were like, oh, yeah, we want to move.

03:52:53.620 --> 03:52:59.620
When I told them, I told my parents recently like, oh, hey, I want to move out,

03:52:59.620 --> 03:53:02.620
but I want to move out really close so I can have my privacy.

03:53:02.620 --> 03:53:04.620
They were like, oh, you want to move to a new house?

03:53:04.620 --> 03:53:05.620
Sure.

03:53:05.620 --> 03:53:08.620
Sure, everyone, right?

03:53:08.620 --> 03:53:14.620
And I went, no, I meant alone.

03:53:14.620 --> 03:53:16.620
Maybe alone.

03:53:16.620 --> 03:53:24.620
No, no, you bring us with you.

03:53:24.620 --> 03:53:34.620
Anyways, I was like, no, no, I mean, like, alone without you for my independence.

03:53:34.620 --> 03:53:42.620
And they went, did we do something wrong?

03:53:42.620 --> 03:53:46.620
Did we do something wrong?

03:53:46.620 --> 03:53:50.620
Why don't you like us, like us anymore?

03:53:50.620 --> 03:54:03.620
I was like, oh, no.

03:54:03.620 --> 03:54:18.620
Oh, yeah, I do get it from my mom.

03:54:19.620 --> 03:54:26.620
Is Mama Modiste also a yander?

03:54:26.620 --> 03:54:29.620
A bit.

03:54:29.620 --> 03:54:34.620
A bit, actually.

03:54:34.620 --> 03:54:36.620
Actually, she went out of nowhere.

03:54:36.620 --> 03:54:45.620
Out of nowhere, came up to me and was like, if, if, honey, honey, if you ever get a boyfriend and he hurts you, I'll kill him.

03:54:45.620 --> 03:54:47.620
I'll fucking kill him.

03:54:47.620 --> 03:55:11.620
She literally said, said, I'll fucking kill him.

03:55:11.620 --> 03:55:17.620
Papa was the same thing.

03:55:17.620 --> 03:55:27.620
It kind of does run in the family, yeah.

03:55:27.620 --> 03:55:36.620
So, yeah, Mama, Mama was like, you know, yeah, she can be a little, she can be really scary sometimes.

03:55:36.620 --> 03:55:44.620
Like, she, oh my gosh, sometimes I think she's psychic.

03:55:44.620 --> 03:55:59.620
But she knows a lot, she knows a lot of things, and I'm just like.

03:55:59.620 --> 03:56:05.620
She knows a lot of things, and it kind of scares me because sometimes she reads my mind.

03:56:05.620 --> 03:56:10.620
Oh, yeah, she did predict my viewer career.

03:56:10.620 --> 03:56:13.620
She, okay, do you guys, okay.

03:56:13.620 --> 03:56:22.620
I didn't get to say this in, I didn't get to say this in debut 2.0 because I got really tired.

03:56:22.620 --> 03:56:31.620
Because I got sick before stream and then I got really tired, so I had to only hit around like the two hour ish mark.

03:56:31.620 --> 03:56:36.620
But, um, what was it?

03:56:36.620 --> 03:56:46.620
Um, so Mama comes from a little bit of a family of like fortune tellers.

03:56:46.620 --> 03:57:08.620
So in Vietnam, um, they have a fortune, uh, fortune telling, fortune telling using regular playing cards.

03:57:08.620 --> 03:57:14.620
And so out of nowhere, she just decided to read my, read my fortune.

03:57:14.620 --> 03:57:24.620
Mmm, no, no, no, not tarot cards, like a regular playing deck. So with like the suits and stuff.

03:57:24.620 --> 03:57:29.620
Yeah, like kind of how you would, but it's like, uh, it's Vietnamese style.

03:57:29.620 --> 03:57:41.620
So it's very common if you go to Vietnam, you'll see people do this type of fortune telling.

03:57:41.620 --> 03:57:53.460
So she was like, okay, your career is something to do with the internet.

03:57:53.460 --> 03:57:59.860
You're going to meet a woman who's going to help you achieve your goals.

03:57:59.860 --> 03:58:07.860
Your work is going to not necessarily be normal, but if it's going to be lots of hard work,

03:58:07.860 --> 03:58:21.460
but it's going to be lots of hard work, but it will be fruitful.

03:58:21.460 --> 03:58:25.300
It will be fruitful and quite lucrative.

03:58:26.180 --> 03:58:38.180
And the woman that you will meet wears primarily black or has black hair.

03:58:45.380 --> 03:58:50.580
And that's what that's what she said. And then that was it. That was it. And this was

03:58:51.140 --> 03:58:57.300
a month, months before I found out about violour.

03:58:59.300 --> 03:59:04.020
Do you have fortune telling powers? I can do a bit of fortune telling.

03:59:04.020 --> 03:59:19.540
I can do a little fortune telling, not lotto numbers, but like tarot cards.

03:59:20.260 --> 03:59:22.660
Like tarot cards, I can do it a little bit.

03:59:22.980 --> 03:59:38.020
But I think mama thought that teaching kids online is kind of a little bit different,

03:59:38.020 --> 03:59:42.900
because it's not physically teaching people online and stuff.

03:59:47.140 --> 03:59:50.500
So I guess mama thought it was something like that.

03:59:53.220 --> 03:59:55.540
So it's not really a normal job.

03:59:59.220 --> 04:00:04.740
So I can do it. Sometimes even my friends, they've liked my fortune

04:00:05.460 --> 04:00:13.220
telling so much that they've actually gotten paid to do it. I'm still a beginner, Bill.

04:00:13.220 --> 04:00:18.660
In my opinion, I'm still a beginner, but mama thinks I inherited the gift from the family.

04:00:19.380 --> 04:00:24.020
It sounds a little weird, right? It's like, oh, you know, you're pretty good at this.

04:00:24.020 --> 04:00:31.380
Yeah, maybe as you know, mama's side of the family has a bit of like a history to fortune

04:00:31.380 --> 04:00:45.060
telling and stuff. I think you mentioned the fortune telling before,

04:00:45.060 --> 04:00:50.820
or maybe Shibi said something very similar. Probably. It was probably, maybe Shibi mentioned it.

04:00:50.820 --> 04:00:59.220
We talked about like tarot cards and stuff, because they're kind of into like that as well.

04:00:59.220 --> 04:01:04.420
I do a lot of good luck stuff, because I don't know, it just makes me feel safer.

04:01:10.420 --> 04:01:14.100
It's just for fun, though. It's just for fun. Fortune telling and stuff is just for fun.

04:01:14.100 --> 04:01:18.260
So don't take it seriously, guys. Don't take it seriously, Senpai.

04:01:20.660 --> 04:01:26.580
But yeah, mama, mama, mama definitely pulled me out of nowhere and did that. And you know what?

04:01:26.580 --> 04:01:34.340
Because she's my mama. I'm generally like, okay, I'm listening. I don't know why she does it,

04:01:34.340 --> 04:01:40.900
how she does it, but like, you know, every time she says something bad will happen today, don't go

04:01:40.900 --> 04:01:45.140
out. And then like, you know, I go out and then something terrible happens. And I'm like, oh,

04:01:46.340 --> 04:01:48.580
I saw, I listen, I listen to her a lot.

04:01:52.820 --> 04:01:57.140
I listen to her a lot, because I'm just like, she knows something that I don't.

04:01:59.140 --> 04:02:01.380
She knows something that I don't, I don't.

04:02:06.420 --> 04:02:08.260
You know, it's just one of those things where I'm like,

04:02:08.900 --> 04:02:12.660
okay, I don't know a whole lot about this, but I'm just going to listen to my mama.

04:02:22.260 --> 04:02:23.140
That advice time.

04:02:26.660 --> 04:02:30.500
Understood. Here is your advice. Don't be ugly.

04:02:30.900 --> 04:02:38.900
You hear that, senpai? I hope this helps.

04:02:46.660 --> 04:02:53.700
Sounds like a good advice to me. Solid advice.

04:03:00.900 --> 04:03:09.220
Not gonna lie, my entire PC, Wi-Fi and power shut down, right? This is about how we talked about

04:03:09.220 --> 04:03:17.460
tarot cards. Oh, shit. Yeah, I don't know, mama, it's probably a coincidence, but like, mama,

04:03:17.460 --> 04:03:23.140
mama truly believes in that type of stuff. So I, I tend to listen to her because I feel like,

04:03:23.140 --> 04:03:27.940
I don't know, you ever have the sage mother and father advice. And then you're just like,

04:03:27.940 --> 04:03:32.340
yeah, they know something more than I do. So I'm just going to listen. I don't care if it sounds

04:03:32.340 --> 04:03:46.580
kind of weird. I don't care if it sounds kind of weird or if it sounds like, you know, like

04:03:47.300 --> 04:03:50.820
weird, bad, just, uh.

04:03:59.380 --> 04:04:01.700
So I just listen, listen to mama.

04:04:06.660 --> 04:04:10.900
But yeah, mama is trying to teach me to do Vietnamese fortune telling,

04:04:10.900 --> 04:04:15.140
but it's so complex and I don't know certain words and I'm just like, I don't get it.

04:04:15.780 --> 04:04:16.500
I don't get it.

04:04:20.100 --> 04:04:25.220
I don't get it. This is hard. I just stuck with tarot cards instead because I was like, okay,

04:04:25.220 --> 04:04:26.340
this I can understand.

04:04:31.940 --> 04:04:34.340
Maybe a stream to practice? I don't know.

04:04:34.340 --> 04:04:54.260
I would not allow mama, mama, modest to come teach on stream. I would not allow them. Listen,

04:04:54.260 --> 04:05:01.860
if they asked me, honey, Netflix stopped working. Can you call them and tell them to make it work

04:05:01.860 --> 04:05:05.460
again? You think I'm going to let them on stream?

04:05:17.780 --> 04:05:25.940
Immediately, immediately, I would get Doc's hardcore. Are these your students, sweetie?

04:05:26.900 --> 04:05:31.620
Hi from address, address, address, address, address, address.

04:05:33.460 --> 04:05:34.980
How do you know my

04:05:45.460 --> 04:05:51.380
Like I would be instantly Doc's. I could make an entire, listen, listen, listen.

04:05:51.860 --> 04:06:06.020
Listen, it took me years and I have still not have succeeded in teaching Papa how to use a cell

04:06:06.020 --> 04:06:18.420
phone, a flip phone. I, when I, I was like, here to pick up, you just open the phone and you know

04:06:18.900 --> 04:06:20.340
what, what Papa did?

04:06:24.260 --> 04:06:31.300
He said, okay, I got it. He opens the flip phone and closes it again and puts it against his

04:06:31.300 --> 04:06:34.180
ear and goes, hello, it's not working.

04:06:34.180 --> 04:07:01.700
Oh my gosh. And I, I didn't even know.

04:07:04.980 --> 04:07:08.180
Do you know how hard it was to teach them how to use Netflix?

04:07:09.860 --> 04:07:18.260
It was pretty hard and I taught them and I was only able to teach them because the, the little, uh,

04:07:20.740 --> 04:07:27.140
the, the remote that come, I don't know, I think it was like a Blu-ray player

04:07:27.940 --> 04:07:33.620
comes with the remote that says, that has a button that says Netflix.

04:07:41.860 --> 04:07:48.180
And I just like, click this button, tap this button and it will take you to Netflix.

04:07:50.820 --> 04:07:55.460
And then if you want to watch, watch anything, press these button and hit okay.

04:07:56.420 --> 04:07:59.940
Okay. It took me a long time.

04:08:03.460 --> 04:08:09.380
It took me a long time, but I managed to teach them how to use Netflix.

04:08:13.220 --> 04:08:19.060
It's, it was tough. It was tough. So there is no way. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,

04:08:20.020 --> 04:08:25.060
but you will not be able to meet my, my parents on stream.

04:08:26.820 --> 04:08:32.820
I've tried multiple times to tell them what my job is and they said, oh, you teach. Oh, okay.

04:08:32.820 --> 04:08:37.780
So you, you teach kids online how to speak English, right?

04:08:41.220 --> 04:08:42.980
And at this point, I say, yeah, sure.

04:08:42.980 --> 04:08:52.260
I just say, do they call you every time Netflix logs out the account? Yes. Yes, they do.

04:08:56.660 --> 04:09:01.780
They do. If they go on the wrong profile, they start crying and telling me,

04:09:01.780 --> 04:09:06.580
why isn't there old, their show that they were currently watching on this profile?

04:09:06.580 --> 04:09:08.180
No.

04:09:22.020 --> 04:09:26.020
But how will we ask them for your hand in marriage or lie? Well,

04:09:26.020 --> 04:09:29.940
I already have a plan set up. So don't step out of it. Okay. Senpai.

04:09:30.500 --> 04:09:42.100
So I was like, it's okay though. They think that every anime I watch is either Inuyash or

04:09:42.100 --> 04:09:56.900
Sailor Moon cause I was obsessed with them as a kid. So please trust me. This is a,

04:09:56.900 --> 04:10:07.860
this is a long process, but I promise Senpai, we'll have our happily ever after together.

04:10:07.860 --> 04:10:26.340
Just trust, trust the process. Trust the process.

04:10:30.020 --> 04:10:31.540
Don't worry, they'll meet you.

04:10:31.540 --> 04:10:44.020
For now, though, they believe that you're my little student.

04:11:01.780 --> 04:11:08.900
That's what they believe. You're my, you're my, you're my Senpai, but they believe that you're my

04:11:08.900 --> 04:11:21.140
students. I think that's really funny though. I think it's really funny.

04:11:21.140 --> 04:11:28.740
So remember, let's have a little secret together.

04:11:51.140 --> 04:12:16.740
I still have to get used to my new, new routine.

04:12:21.540 --> 04:12:26.340
I'm also sad. Wow.

04:12:34.980 --> 04:12:41.540
I'll just, I'll just beat these guys first and then run to like a save point and then we'll do a

04:12:41.540 --> 04:12:59.140
little chat and then I'll um, and then I'll, I'll head on.

04:13:12.260 --> 04:13:15.140
So

04:13:33.780 --> 04:13:35.780
that's the wrong way. I do have to go this way.

04:13:36.500 --> 04:13:39.940
Through it, we're running.

04:13:44.260 --> 04:13:44.500
Bye.

04:13:50.420 --> 04:13:51.780
They know you're trying to leave.

04:13:54.660 --> 04:14:02.180
They know they're, that I'm trying to leave and that they want me to stay just like my Senpai.

04:14:03.140 --> 04:14:03.780
Right?

04:14:06.900 --> 04:14:08.900
Okay. Yeah, let's save here.

04:14:11.780 --> 04:14:12.180
Ooh.

04:14:17.460 --> 04:14:19.380
Oh wait, everybody saved.

04:14:23.140 --> 04:14:24.980
I forgot how to get to the menu again.

04:14:32.180 --> 04:14:42.180
All right.

04:14:52.340 --> 04:14:56.180
And close your eyes, Senpai. Flashbang.

04:15:02.980 --> 04:15:14.180
Back to color.

04:15:14.180 --> 04:15:24.180
Um, um, um.

04:15:27.700 --> 04:15:34.100
Sorry I cough so, so much Senpai and like player might throw it a lot. I've been a bit sick.

04:15:35.380 --> 04:15:42.660
Actually ever since before, the day before debut. I think I got a bit sick from basically stress.

04:15:43.460 --> 04:15:47.700
Stress, nerves, all of the emotions rolled up into one.

04:15:55.700 --> 04:15:58.180
So I've been, I've been coughing a little bit

04:16:00.500 --> 04:16:05.620
and clearing my throat a little bit more. I do get a little bit flummy. So yeah.

04:16:05.620 --> 04:16:13.140
Feeling better now? I think I'm getting to the tail end of it, but I still have like the cough and stuff.

04:16:16.580 --> 04:16:21.620
I feel bad that I'm not always in my like tip top shape when uh, screaming.

04:16:22.260 --> 04:16:38.500
Yeah. Yeah, debut was so stressful for me. When I first did debut, I was, I was, I wanted to make

04:16:38.500 --> 04:16:49.540
such a good impression because I was worried that a lot of people would scrutinize the allure

04:16:49.540 --> 04:16:56.900
more than usual. So I really tried my best. I tried my best to make a good first impression.

04:17:04.500 --> 04:17:14.660
So yeah, and I was worried that, that you know, after debut, um, you know, people would be like,

04:17:15.540 --> 04:17:20.420
would be, would scrutinize, scrutinize a little more as well.

04:17:23.540 --> 04:17:28.420
So I was like, oh no, I have to impress my senpais. After all, I'm their kohai

04:17:29.060 --> 04:17:35.140
and, and they'll need to love me and I'll be really sad if they don't like me.

04:17:35.940 --> 04:17:49.300
So I'm really happy that I made, uh, at least a decent impression on my senpais.

04:17:52.180 --> 04:17:54.580
Well, as long as, uh, everything's all good.

04:17:57.300 --> 04:18:01.460
Okay, I leaned my arm onto this table so much, made an event.

04:18:05.220 --> 04:18:11.860
So yeah, let's see if I have any, any news or something coming up. Let me take a look.

04:18:11.860 --> 04:18:17.300
See, I know it's pretty light right now. Sorry for yapping so much about my family.

04:18:21.780 --> 04:18:26.500
Here, let's see my schedule. Well, all my, I've, I've posted up all my schedule already.

04:18:27.300 --> 04:18:30.660
I'm pretty, pretty cool with that.

04:18:30.740 --> 04:18:40.500
Uh, okay, we have merch from Uwu Market. That's already done. Tomorrow is my

04:18:43.460 --> 04:18:45.940
first ever ASMR stream.

04:18:51.700 --> 04:18:56.260
It's my first ever ASMR stream, so I hope, uh, senpais will tune into that.

04:18:57.140 --> 04:19:04.980
Am I a little nervous? Yeah, I'm a little nervous about it. Um, I had some things planned,

04:19:04.980 --> 04:19:13.220
but because of, um, YouTube kind of cracking down on certain things, I'm going to have to just

04:19:13.220 --> 04:19:22.100
readjust some things. Um, it's going to be safe for work. So have no worries about that. I'm not

04:19:22.100 --> 04:19:29.860
going to go, you know, but I'm going to, uh,

04:19:37.220 --> 04:19:39.860
I mean, is I'm here?

04:19:40.740 --> 04:19:52.100
Oh, hi! I'm from Umapluses here. Wow. Umapluses is, uh, is another,

04:19:52.820 --> 04:19:59.620
is, uh, is another, uh, V2 company that everyone should check out. Really cute girls.

04:19:59.620 --> 04:20:18.180
Um, so, um, let's see, my, my ASMR stream is going to be, uh, a lot of pampering. I went out already.

04:20:18.180 --> 04:20:25.860
I went out and got everyone, um, the kind of, the, the, the ice globe, the ice globe rollers,

04:20:26.500 --> 04:20:34.020
and I've got, uh, a gel mask, uh, that I think makes a nice sound, I think. Um,

04:20:42.180 --> 04:20:46.260
um, so I'm going to try to pamper, pamper my senpais.

04:20:46.740 --> 04:20:52.820
Do you do heartbeat? Um, I'm not sure I'll do heartbeat.

04:20:53.860 --> 04:21:03.060
Um, I think you'll have to go tomorrow to see what I'm planning. I'm not sure if it's going to be,

04:21:04.100 --> 04:21:09.780
um, typical because I, I, to be honest, I'm just jumping and blinded.

04:21:10.740 --> 04:21:19.300
Uh, to be honest, I'm jumping and blind, so I've, I've never really watched, um, other ASMR videos.

04:21:22.020 --> 04:21:26.900
Yeah, it's going to be whispers. I promise you it'll be relaxing. It'll be relaxing whispers.

04:21:30.740 --> 04:21:37.300
So, I, I haven't studied visually or auditorially because I don't know, I just,

04:21:38.260 --> 04:21:44.580
I'm very sensitive to sound, so I, I have trouble studying, um, other people's videos, so I've been

04:21:45.780 --> 04:21:51.300
kind of doing it in a way where I've been just reading about it.

04:21:57.380 --> 04:22:01.860
So, I'm definitely going to pamper, pamper my, my senpais.

04:22:02.020 --> 04:22:12.500
I'm going to pamper my senpais, but uh, don't worry though. I've been studying sometimes,

04:22:12.500 --> 04:22:18.100
a lot of times. Strawny send me things if she's like, you need improvement in this area. Here,

04:22:18.100 --> 04:22:23.620
here's an example. I do take the time to watch those videos that she sends me.

04:22:24.420 --> 04:22:34.500
So, hopefully, uh, it works out. I'm going to see if it works. Let me know. Senpais, I hope you let me

04:22:34.500 --> 04:22:44.020
know if something's, uh, too strong or too sensitive, so I'm not really sure, um, about how ASMR is,

04:22:44.020 --> 04:22:49.380
but I did, I did some reading, I did some reading about it, so hopefully I'll do it in my own little way.

04:22:54.020 --> 04:23:00.260
If it's Strawny, those are probably some interesting training videos.

04:23:02.020 --> 04:23:03.860
Am I allowed to say this?

04:23:08.420 --> 04:23:15.380
Sometimes Strawny's like, nope, that wasn't good enough. Here, go practice.

04:23:15.380 --> 04:23:25.140
And then I would have to re-record and stuff.

04:23:25.140 --> 04:23:44.260
Strawny, Strawny, um, definitely is, is, uh, guiding me, guiding me a lot.

04:23:44.340 --> 04:24:00.500
So, um, if something, there's, there's one I know, I'm not very proud of my very first,

04:24:00.500 --> 04:24:06.820
one of my very first audios for Patreon. I'm not very proud of, so what if you, if you hear it?

04:24:07.780 --> 04:24:10.900
I think I did an okay job on it, but I feel like I

04:24:13.460 --> 04:24:18.420
would, I would improve, I should improve more. I'm learning from my mistakes,

04:24:18.420 --> 04:24:23.060
so I feel like it's not, it's not the best quality, it's because I am a beginner.

04:24:23.860 --> 04:24:39.620
Enjoy learning? Of course, I enjoy learning. It's, it's a part of my likes, my hobbies.

04:24:39.620 --> 04:24:45.700
I love research, I love learning. I very much have kind of like a research-esque mind.

04:24:53.060 --> 04:25:01.620
So yeah, uh, please understand if, if there's any harsh comments, uh, this, uh, when I first recorded

04:25:01.620 --> 04:25:11.380
all of those, uh, all of those, uh, recordings were definitely, uh, a month plus in advance.

04:25:12.180 --> 04:25:18.980
So, the following month should be better, but I think it might be, I think I'm still,

04:25:19.060 --> 04:25:21.860
still learning, so I'll try to improve over time.

04:25:25.220 --> 04:25:31.300
The first audio was good, good. I think that one was, I think I found a little more confident in

04:25:31.300 --> 04:25:44.980
that one. In, in, in that one, uh, so Strani's definitely helping me. The other girls, girls,

04:25:45.540 --> 04:25:51.780
uh, are definitely helping me as well. So yeah, uh, I think a lot of us are, are definitely noobs,

04:25:51.780 --> 04:25:59.860
but I think, uh, they've, they've dabbled, they've dabbled in, in ASMR a little bit more than me.

04:25:59.860 --> 04:26:06.340
Me, I, I'm completely new, I'm completely new, so I'm just like, oh okay, Strani's, Strani's has taught

04:26:06.340 --> 04:26:20.180
me in her own way. Um, yeah. Azura said she's new too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think Azura is not

04:26:20.180 --> 04:26:23.700
ignorant. When I came in, I was like, I don't even know what a trigger is.

04:26:37.060 --> 04:26:40.980
I was like, trigger? Like, oh my devil trigger.

04:26:46.340 --> 04:26:48.820
Oh, like a gun trigger. Is that a popular race?

04:26:59.700 --> 04:27:04.340
Is there a way would you like feedback structured or would you let, let you go on your own pace?

04:27:05.060 --> 04:27:12.180
Um, I think Strani and I know where my weaknesses are, but I don't mind a little bit of constructive

04:27:12.180 --> 04:27:18.420
criticism, but not mean criticism. I will cry. And if I go, if I cry, uh, someone's gonna pay for it.

04:27:24.100 --> 04:27:25.300
I hope that makes sense.

04:27:25.300 --> 04:27:38.980
Uh, you can give my feedback through my moral. It's fine. I do read through my morals. I'm sorry

04:27:38.980 --> 04:27:43.540
I haven't really replied to a lot of them. I, I have been reading all of them though, but a lot

04:27:43.540 --> 04:27:47.140
of questions that have been coming in have been things I've already addressed. So I was like,

04:27:47.140 --> 04:27:54.900
I don't know if I should answer this or I'm, or I'm shy about answering because some of them are very,

04:27:54.900 --> 04:28:03.860
if you are very personal and I'm just like, uh, I'm very thankful and they're, they're mine.

04:28:03.860 --> 04:28:08.180
They're mine and only mine. No, I'm not even Senpai gets to see my reaction.

04:28:15.060 --> 04:28:20.900
What limits do you have on questions mask? No, you mean, what do you mean?

04:28:25.460 --> 04:28:28.660
Like, what questions do I not like?

04:28:32.100 --> 04:28:38.100
Um, I guess questions that blushing mercy. Yeah. If I read some of them, I'm like,

04:28:43.220 --> 04:28:49.940
what do you want us to not ask about? Well, if things have are, are kind of easily findable.

04:28:50.820 --> 04:28:55.380
So like, if you're like, oh, do you play hentai games or arrow gay?

04:28:57.060 --> 04:29:04.020
Well, I address that in my debut. Um, if I, if, oh, do you like this anime and it's in my debut,

04:29:04.020 --> 04:29:07.540
I'm going to be really, I get a little, I get a little miffed, you know?

04:29:11.860 --> 04:29:18.020
I get a little miffed if someone asks me, how do I, uh, if they ask me a question about how

04:29:18.100 --> 04:29:21.620
the internal system works? I don't know. That's a question for strongy.

04:29:25.380 --> 04:29:34.340
So risk a questions are fine for you. Yes. Uh, although I may not answer it because, um, it's a journey.

04:29:37.540 --> 04:29:39.140
It's a journey. It's a journey for me.

04:29:48.820 --> 04:30:01.140
So, uh, yeah, kayfabe questions are okay. I feel a little bad because I dropped kayfabe a lot.

04:30:08.500 --> 04:30:09.140
Um,

04:30:10.100 --> 04:30:26.820
yeah, I feel like most questions are free and on the table if, oh, I know some questions that I don't

04:30:26.820 --> 04:30:31.540
like. I've been recently getting questions that I don't like, that I know that I don't like. I feel

04:30:31.540 --> 04:30:40.420
like they're baiting for me to answer in order to, to induce some rage. And I don't like that.

04:30:43.220 --> 04:30:46.820
I don't like that. And I think those are not my senpais. I think those are trolls.

04:30:53.060 --> 04:31:00.020
I think those are trolls. So I don't like that. I don't like questions about, um,

04:31:01.700 --> 04:31:06.580
like pineapple and pizza kind of question. No, no, no, like, uh,

04:31:09.780 --> 04:31:11.860
more offensive questions, you know?

04:31:16.980 --> 04:31:24.260
So, like pineapple and pizza, by the way, is good. My favorite pizza is pineapple in

04:31:24.260 --> 04:31:27.780
my room. So anyone else can fight me. You can try.

04:31:34.740 --> 04:31:37.780
But like questions that are definitely, um,

04:31:43.700 --> 04:31:49.620
definitely questions that are definitely trying to get a riot out of me or someone else. Does that

04:31:49.700 --> 04:31:59.060
make sense? So I don't like political questions. I don't like, um, questions about,

04:32:00.020 --> 04:32:10.180
like, personal things about me. So, um, no, let's just, I, I've, instead, I haven't seen

04:32:10.180 --> 04:32:17.940
any of my morals yet, but I've had people ask me questions in the past where it's like,

04:32:17.940 --> 04:32:24.500
where do you live? Tell me where you live. What's your phone number? I want to give you a call,

04:32:24.500 --> 04:32:33.620
personal call. That type of thing. I don't like things by invading my privacy. So those are

04:32:34.180 --> 04:32:38.100
kind of like, I feel like it's kind of common. These are common questions.

04:32:39.060 --> 04:32:50.980
But I definitely don't like questions that are like, you know, trolls and stuff. So,

04:32:53.940 --> 04:32:58.820
yeah, so it's, it's kind of like the basic etiquettes. Just remember basic etiquettes and

04:32:58.820 --> 04:33:04.500
most likely I will, I will answer it or I will keep that question in my mind to answer in the

04:33:04.500 --> 04:33:11.140
future because maybe I don't know. I don't know. And I'm, I'm still discovering pieces of myself as

04:33:11.140 --> 04:33:23.060
well. So for example, I don't know how to, like, if someone says, what are you into? I feel like

04:33:24.820 --> 04:33:29.940
the, that question's a little hard for me because I don't really know what I'm into.

04:33:30.500 --> 04:33:34.500
And I'm also slowly discovering what I'm into and what I'm not into, I guess.

04:33:38.100 --> 04:33:39.620
Like, yeah.

04:33:42.900 --> 04:33:47.700
Those questions are fine. I just feel like I don't have the ability to answer them now.

04:33:47.700 --> 04:33:50.500
I don't have the knowledge of myself to answer them now.

04:33:53.620 --> 04:33:54.260
Things like that.

04:33:55.220 --> 04:34:01.140
So, we're all, we're all learning together. And then once I find out if I don't like something,

04:34:01.140 --> 04:34:02.260
I'll let you know.

04:34:07.620 --> 04:34:12.500
It's like trying food, you know, I'm still trying a lot of food. So I don't really know, like, oh,

04:34:12.500 --> 04:34:18.100
I do like this, but, oh, do you, I've never tried this before. So I don't know if I like it or not.

04:34:24.260 --> 04:34:34.740
That makes us your students. Your mom was 100% on our prediction. I think it's more like

04:34:35.380 --> 04:34:40.580
senpais are teaching me, I think. I think my senpais are more like mentoring me.

04:34:46.580 --> 04:34:52.820
I know my mods are supposed to be silent, but I thank you for my mods as well. I see a lot of

04:34:53.460 --> 04:34:59.700
senpais also show appreciation for them. So thank you. Thank you mods. Shut up, but also thank you.

04:35:05.380 --> 04:35:07.700
I truly, I truly do appreciate the hard work.

04:35:23.380 --> 04:35:32.500
So I really appreciate them. Shout outs, shout outs to mods.

04:35:39.780 --> 04:35:43.060
Especially when I say things like cut off his testicles.

04:35:43.060 --> 04:35:48.340
My lesson to me. I'm so appreciative of that.

04:35:54.020 --> 04:35:55.380
No, they're doing really good.

04:36:02.500 --> 04:36:10.660
Good. But yeah, I appreciate it. This is actually my first time talking to so many people as well.

04:36:10.660 --> 04:36:16.900
So I appreciate having all the help that I can get, especially the, my gen mates help me a lot,

04:36:16.900 --> 04:36:20.340
and scrawny helps me a lot, and manager helps me a lot.

04:36:29.220 --> 04:36:34.420
Mods destroy them. Next time I'll be like, oh, look, I pulled out my mods card.

04:36:34.980 --> 04:36:37.700
Maw moderators obliterate.

04:36:51.460 --> 04:36:53.060
Put mods in attack mode.

04:36:53.060 --> 04:37:14.740
And I put one of my mods face down.

04:37:23.060 --> 04:37:37.380
Wait, do you actually know Yu-Gi-Oh? I've only watched the anime. I've never really played it.

04:37:37.380 --> 04:37:50.740
I don't know how to play like Yu-Gi-Oh Yu-Gi-Oh, but I've only watched the anime. I think the first season.

04:37:53.780 --> 04:38:17.060
So I only know a few cards as well, mostly Exodia. In fact, I have like, do you guys know that collab

04:38:17.060 --> 04:38:26.260
with Hello Kitty? The McDonald's collab? Hello Kitty? And it's like the Yu-Gi-Oh Hello Kitty

04:38:26.260 --> 04:38:35.220
collab? I have like, on one of my, one of my lights here. I forgot to turn off my lights,

04:38:35.220 --> 04:38:47.380
turned on my lights today, but one of my lights here is a pom-pom pudding Exodia.

04:38:54.100 --> 04:38:59.940
Yeah, that's Hello Kitty with Yu-Gi-Oh's hair. It's hilarious, right? So I have, I have that one.

04:39:00.500 --> 04:39:06.180
I have, that's the one I wanted. That's the one I wanted. I also have,

04:39:07.060 --> 04:39:12.900
wow, this one I'm going to give to a friend of mine. I have Pochakko as the time wizard.

04:39:13.860 --> 04:39:22.500
And I have my melody as a dark magician girl. And I also have

04:39:23.140 --> 04:39:32.900
um, uh, the cinnamon roll blue eyes my dragon. What's your favorite Hello Kitty character,

04:39:32.900 --> 04:39:39.380
Kohai? Um, pom-pom pudding. I love, I love pom-pom pudding's butthole. I think it's a charm point.

04:39:39.380 --> 04:39:50.580
I think it's cute. What? What do you mean? No one knows about the butthole? Everyone,

04:39:50.580 --> 04:40:00.260
look at pom-pom pudding's butthole. I think it's cute. If a product does not have the butthole,

04:40:00.260 --> 04:40:11.620
I do not buy it. I do not buy it. Um, my second favorites are probably Little Twin Stars. I think

04:40:11.620 --> 04:40:26.500
they're cute. Is my end area Hello Kitty girl? Um, I don't own a lot of Hello Kitty stuff. I do

04:40:26.500 --> 04:40:33.780
like Hello Kitty, but I don't own a lot of Hello Kitty stuff. So if, for example, uh, I don't just

04:40:33.780 --> 04:40:40.580
buy things because it's Hello Kitty or anything. To be honest, I'm kind of like trying to not really

04:40:40.580 --> 04:40:45.540
want a lot of things. So the things on my wish list are kind of like things that I've been like

04:40:45.540 --> 04:40:53.380
thinking about a lot or just a tiny treat. Uh, mostly from, I think a lot of them are just things

04:40:53.380 --> 04:41:07.460
that I, I think will improve my stream. So things that will help improve my stream. So, uh, right

04:41:07.460 --> 04:41:16.580
now, uh, the Senpai, thank you Senpais for gifting me things, uh, so far. Um, I'm still reading through

04:41:16.580 --> 04:41:25.060
it. I, I'm actually, I recently received a, uh, the, the nausea, uh, bracelet thing. So hopefully

04:41:25.060 --> 04:41:31.220
it works out for some streams so that I can, I can use that. I'll test that out for streams, uh,

04:41:31.300 --> 04:41:38.180
for first person stuff. Uh, the blanket is already behind me. It's kind of airing out right now,

04:41:38.820 --> 04:41:43.220
because it's, it's kind of, it arrived kind of like with the factory sense. So I'm, I'm airing it

04:41:43.220 --> 04:41:49.780
out a little bit. Um, it's working great right now. If it's working great, if you can hear my audio,

04:41:50.740 --> 04:41:57.300
um, I'm kind of, I'm kind of happy with my audio. I'm happy with my audio,

04:41:57.540 --> 04:42:02.660
with my audio setup right now. I think it's pretty good. I think it's pretty good. Uh,

04:42:04.420 --> 04:42:09.700
I've covered some areas where I think, uh, has a little bit of a reverberation. I've,

04:42:09.700 --> 04:42:14.420
I've covered those areas. So I think, I think it's pretty good now. I think, uh, mind you,

04:42:14.420 --> 04:42:19.700
the space I'm in right now that I can only fit myself in is like kind of, is the open area in

04:42:19.700 --> 04:42:28.580
the basement is the open area in the basement. So there's like stairs here and like lots of

04:42:28.580 --> 04:42:40.820
crevices and stuff. So I'm trying my best. I'm trying my best. I tried my best to sound, uh,

04:42:40.900 --> 04:42:49.620
as, as good as possible for my supplies. Um, yeah, I'm raining through some of the manuals for some

04:42:49.620 --> 04:42:55.620
stuff. Uh, everything arrived. Everything, everything's arrived. So yeah.

04:42:59.780 --> 04:43:05.300
Thought the Ku 100 mic, isn't that like $8,000? Now it's way more than that.

04:43:05.860 --> 04:43:09.860
Uh, I put an LOL on that. It was kind of a joke. It was kind of a joke.

04:43:13.860 --> 04:43:19.860
It's a, it's more of a joke. I put it there for like, ha ha, look at me. I'm so passionate about ASMR.

04:43:22.820 --> 04:43:28.820
There's a reason why in there it says, uh, it says LOL.

04:43:28.820 --> 04:43:38.420
You say that until it's bought. I don't think anyone's going to buy that, to be honest.

04:43:39.380 --> 04:43:43.220
Do you guys think, uh, I should take it off then?

04:43:44.660 --> 04:43:47.860
You should take it off the list then? I put it there as like kind of like a,

04:43:48.580 --> 04:44:01.780
uh, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm experimenting and I hear it's pretty good, but it's, it's quite a big upgrade.

04:44:07.220 --> 04:44:11.700
I think, uh, if I had to choose one thing that I would really, really, really want,

04:44:11.700 --> 04:44:18.420
would be the U87. I think I would really love the U87 more than the Ku 100.

04:44:28.180 --> 04:44:36.260
Keep it on, keep it on, keep it, take it off. Maybe, maybe I should take it off.

04:44:36.260 --> 04:44:39.780
I don't know. I feel a little guilty for putting it on because I, uh, maybe that,

04:44:40.340 --> 04:44:45.940
I put the precedence on, um, someone, someone to, to try to get it.

04:44:54.100 --> 04:44:57.140
Yeah, I'll probably remove it. Heck, I'll remove it right now.

04:44:57.140 --> 04:45:12.020
Whoa, I can remove it right now. Don't worry, Sunpie.

04:45:16.340 --> 04:45:19.220
There you go. It's gone into the ether.

04:45:27.140 --> 04:45:35.860
It's gone now. Excuse me. Wow.

04:45:44.980 --> 04:45:49.220
But yeah, um, my wishlist stuff, yeah.

04:45:49.220 --> 04:45:50.420
Haha.

04:45:56.580 --> 04:45:57.300
Vanished.

04:46:02.500 --> 04:46:06.180
Are you okay? Hi, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. I just feel I'm still a little bit of sick,

04:46:06.180 --> 04:46:10.660
so I will get like, plummy and coffee all the time, all the, every once in a while.

04:46:13.300 --> 04:46:18.820
It's also pretty cold in the basement, so I get pretty sick easily in the basement.

04:46:19.220 --> 04:46:21.880
I'm streaming like right beside all my supplies

04:46:23.900 --> 04:46:25.900
Yeah, I sent it to the shadow realm

04:46:26.300 --> 04:46:27.980
That's a tea by the way

04:46:27.980 --> 04:46:32.500
Good, but it's so cold down here. Like usually these mugs can hold

04:46:35.940 --> 04:46:37.580
Can hold like

04:46:37.580 --> 04:46:41.300
Heat for a while, but because it's so cold down here. It can get

04:46:42.140 --> 04:46:44.720
Really fast and go get cold really fast

04:46:45.500 --> 04:46:51.140
Yeah, we know it's cold. I provided lots of blankets

04:46:57.360 --> 04:47:03.460
Yeah, you're about to hit the five hour mark. Oh shit. I'm such a yapper. I'm sorry

04:47:09.360 --> 04:47:11.660
Can we try using a thermos for your tea I

04:47:12.460 --> 04:47:14.460
I didn't think about that

04:47:20.380 --> 04:47:23.320
I was like I do have a thermos as far soup though

04:47:24.780 --> 04:47:29.340
But I'm also like I kind of wanted to cool it down a little bit. I may be at thermos might be too hot

04:47:29.340 --> 04:47:31.340
I

04:47:42.620 --> 04:47:48.380
Don't worry. I already have one. I already have a thermos. I bought it for soups. I actually bought it for school

04:47:49.100 --> 04:47:51.420
Uh, I ended up not using it for school

04:47:54.700 --> 04:47:57.420
So I guess I was saving it for camping or something

04:48:00.300 --> 04:48:07.900
I'm camping with senpai. Let me know the forest. Don't worry about the barrel and the bone saw and

04:48:08.300 --> 04:48:10.460
you know the copulous amount of

04:48:12.300 --> 04:48:13.740
Acid

04:48:13.740 --> 04:48:19.820
That I'm bringing along. I don't look good. I don't like that. Do you like camping? I do like the outdoors. I

04:48:21.180 --> 04:48:23.180
Like the outdoors. It's calming

04:48:29.740 --> 04:48:35.740
Someone said they found a bone while we were cleaning our ping-pong mess earlier. Oh, don't worry about it

04:48:42.780 --> 04:48:44.780
This isn't in the beach this is an acid bag

04:48:44.780 --> 04:48:46.780
I

04:48:57.500 --> 04:49:05.100
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. But yeah, yeah, I'll take I'll take it off most things. I just kind of want or

04:49:07.580 --> 04:49:09.180
Or I

04:49:09.180 --> 04:49:11.820
It's things to improve the screen except for the size of fumo

04:49:11.820 --> 04:49:17.340
That's kind of like a want because I don't know. I don't have a lot of saw. I'm a really big fan of siren outa

04:49:20.620 --> 04:49:23.020
A new plan on keeping us from running off in the forest

04:49:28.140 --> 04:49:30.140
Ah

04:49:31.180 --> 04:49:36.940
Sometimes, you know, maybe a little broken ankle might might hurt hurt your chances a little bit

04:49:42.060 --> 04:49:44.060
I

04:49:55.100 --> 04:49:59.420
Give you a head start not without a handicap, of course

04:49:59.420 --> 04:50:01.420
I

04:50:10.860 --> 04:50:12.860
Don't want to run. Yeah

04:50:20.700 --> 04:50:25.580
Well, if you don't want to run then we'll have a good time because then I'll be like camping and then we'll have s'mores and like

04:50:25.900 --> 04:50:27.260
We'll roast

04:50:27.260 --> 04:50:31.660
Roast things over a fire and tell camp stories and stuff. But if you want to run

04:50:32.540 --> 04:50:34.540
I'll give you a head start

04:50:37.340 --> 04:50:39.340
But you know

04:50:40.700 --> 04:50:42.700
Maybe the animals will find you first

04:50:47.660 --> 04:50:51.260
Whatever happened in the og senpai check out the lore video

04:50:56.460 --> 04:50:58.460
I

04:50:58.460 --> 04:51:05.100
Think like if we roast like, you know things over like I would love I would love to have like sweet potatoes

04:51:05.820 --> 04:51:08.460
Over an open fire. I'll be really nice

04:51:19.900 --> 04:51:24.140
So I think that'll be really nice to to have and like maybe have like our own little like

04:51:24.540 --> 04:51:26.540
Fire pit barbecue wouldn't that be nice?

04:51:32.220 --> 04:51:34.220
Is this a plan for a date of course

04:51:37.660 --> 04:51:40.940
And then we can look at the stars together wouldn't that be nice

04:51:49.180 --> 04:51:52.620
Like real sweet potatoes are really nice. I love it. I love it a lot

04:51:54.620 --> 04:51:56.620
So

04:51:57.020 --> 04:52:00.060
But if you if if senpai's decided to start running

04:52:01.100 --> 04:52:03.980
Wow, I did bring some stuff to to help

04:52:15.500 --> 04:52:20.460
Oh, there'll be beer. I don't really like beer actually. I don't really like drinking or

04:52:21.260 --> 04:52:24.060
Any any vices really

04:52:25.100 --> 04:52:29.820
It makes my senses go dull and I don't like that. I like to be alert at all times

04:52:32.620 --> 04:52:34.780
I like root beer though. Yeah, root beer is okay

04:52:36.860 --> 04:52:43.260
I think I got a really bad memory. Um when I was in college

04:52:43.340 --> 04:52:50.780
Um, I went to the local like the student the student

04:52:51.580 --> 04:52:54.940
our pub, I don't know. I don't know the difference to be honest

04:52:55.740 --> 04:52:57.660
um

04:52:57.660 --> 04:53:01.100
and I yeah, I was with a a group of uh

04:53:02.860 --> 04:53:04.860
group of classmates and

04:53:06.540 --> 04:53:11.660
Ended up leaving because I hate I hated it. I hated it. So the beer came

04:53:12.620 --> 04:53:14.620
Uh

04:53:15.260 --> 04:53:17.260
beer came and

04:53:17.660 --> 04:53:19.100
Okay, uh

04:53:19.100 --> 04:53:23.900
It was poured out into the drinks and it'll be my first time trying beer. It's like, oh, I've never tried beer before

04:53:27.020 --> 04:53:33.020
I swear it smelled like piss it was warm

04:53:35.020 --> 04:53:37.020
It was warm

04:53:37.580 --> 04:53:43.340
It smelled really bad and when I tasted it it tasted like, you know

04:53:45.020 --> 04:53:50.380
P and I was like the fucking person who served this to us like just pissing a jug

04:53:50.380 --> 04:53:52.380
Look

04:54:01.420 --> 04:54:06.140
Great, have you tried tried pee it tasted like what pee smells like

04:54:10.060 --> 04:54:13.980
So it was like warm and it felt it looked like

04:54:15.580 --> 04:54:17.660
P and I was like

04:54:21.340 --> 04:54:23.340
Ah

04:54:31.660 --> 04:54:36.380
It's just smells bad and it was warm and then I I was like

04:54:38.220 --> 04:54:45.180
I asked I asked I asked the the staff I was like this is this normally served warm and they're like

04:54:45.180 --> 04:54:49.820
Yeah, beers normally served warm like it's best. Uh, it's best uh

04:54:50.700 --> 04:54:52.940
beer tastes best at like when it's like

04:54:53.820 --> 04:54:56.140
You know warm and I was like

04:55:01.020 --> 04:55:03.520
I'm gonna pay for my part and I'm gonna leave

04:55:16.140 --> 04:55:18.140
I

04:55:21.180 --> 04:55:30.700
I uh I left I left I I literally almost threw up in that cup. I like spat it out

04:55:39.020 --> 04:55:41.020
Uh, I spat it out so I

04:55:41.100 --> 04:55:43.100
I

04:55:43.100 --> 04:55:49.500
I I I uh that was my first interaction with beer and I've never liked beer ever since

04:55:53.340 --> 04:55:56.940
I've never liked beer ever since so if anyone just offers me beer

04:55:57.020 --> 04:56:02.140
I just think of that moment even if it's cold. I still taste like I drink it. I'm like

04:56:04.460 --> 04:56:06.460
You just like alcohols, um

04:56:07.180 --> 04:56:10.220
I don't dislike it, but I tend to avoid alcohol

04:56:11.340 --> 04:56:17.420
It it uh dulls the senses and if it dulls the senses, I can't I can't

04:56:19.420 --> 04:56:22.620
Be at my peak around my senpai's

04:56:26.780 --> 04:56:33.900
Like um if I'm around my gal pals my my friends, uh, we'll probably drink a little bit of like

04:56:33.980 --> 04:56:38.620
I don't know like a long island iced tea something sweet, you know or like those

04:56:39.500 --> 04:56:49.020
Baileys or something, but I uh last time I went drinking with workers. I uh got shit-based and uh

04:56:50.060 --> 04:56:54.380
I'm not a good drunk. Let's just say I'm not a good drunk

04:56:58.620 --> 04:57:05.340
Um, yeah, I'm not a good drunk. I think I told them I hated them or something

04:57:08.940 --> 04:57:14.940
I hated them and then I hated my work and everything in front of the my boss. So let's let's not just oh, yeah, it's not

04:57:16.940 --> 04:57:18.940
It's not good

04:57:18.940 --> 04:57:20.940
so, uh

04:57:21.820 --> 04:57:24.300
Did you hate them um sometimes I did

04:57:28.060 --> 04:57:30.060
Sometimes I did so

04:57:32.140 --> 04:57:37.180
I guess those feelings, you know one of frustrations when I was frustrated with my co-workers

04:57:37.900 --> 04:57:39.900
um

04:57:40.060 --> 04:57:45.020
Yeah, I'm gonna so if anyone asked for a drinking stream that's not happening

04:57:49.420 --> 04:57:56.300
Well, will you tell us if you were drunk with us? I probably just bitch about how you keep on trying to run away from me

04:58:00.860 --> 04:58:03.420
I was the next day at work that was my last day at work

04:58:04.300 --> 04:58:08.300
We were doing a drinking celebration for my last day of work

04:58:09.100 --> 04:58:11.100
I just went

04:58:31.980 --> 04:58:33.980
Uh, so I uh, I don't drink

04:58:34.940 --> 04:58:39.660
I don't drink and the last time and the time before that when I drunk I

04:58:40.540 --> 04:58:43.180
uh sober I was sober in front of

04:58:44.220 --> 04:58:50.860
The in front of the toilet uh with my barfinette. So I was like, uh, you know what?

04:58:51.580 --> 04:58:53.580
Screw drinking

04:58:55.180 --> 04:58:57.180
Screw screw drinking

04:59:01.740 --> 04:59:03.740
So I don't like drinking

04:59:04.220 --> 04:59:06.220
I

04:59:06.460 --> 04:59:11.740
Yeah, so I I I prefer to keep my health up, especially since my health isn't the greatest

04:59:20.700 --> 04:59:24.780
I guess my biggest vice would be like the occasional drunk food

04:59:26.780 --> 04:59:28.620
Like um

04:59:28.700 --> 04:59:36.220
I know like mama mama and papa's favorite celebration food is it's fried chicken and I do like fried chicken too

04:59:52.140 --> 04:59:57.020
So yeah, I I was like I don't like, uh, I don't like drinking

04:59:58.620 --> 05:00:00.620
So

05:00:02.300 --> 05:00:09.100
Yeah, uh like, uh, we're basically like birthdays and stuff are celebrated with fried chicken

05:00:17.500 --> 05:00:22.140
So I don't really I don't drink I do keep some

05:00:23.100 --> 05:00:28.300
I've already reached five hours. Congratulations to me. Not not my record, but

05:00:31.020 --> 05:00:32.460
Um

05:00:32.460 --> 05:00:40.940
I do keep some drinks around with me or like, uh, if my gal pals if we're having like a a girly sleepover

05:00:42.220 --> 05:00:48.060
We're having a girly sleepover. They want they want a little drink. Uh, I I I I I keep some just in case

05:00:48.380 --> 05:00:58.940
Seven hours to beat strannies strannies records strannies record is 12 hours. What are you talking about?

05:01:04.140 --> 05:01:07.020
I I do have a lot of endurance yesterday though, I definitely

05:01:07.660 --> 05:01:14.300
Didn't have a lot of endurance probably because before I was doing the the 2.0 and I was really stressed

05:01:19.020 --> 05:01:27.500
Oh seven hours to go five plus seven. Wow. I'm so stupid. See this is why I hate numbers. I can't do math

05:01:33.420 --> 05:01:38.300
But yeah, if senpais like, uh, beer and stuff I will provide beer

05:01:39.180 --> 05:01:43.740
Or like a drink for my senpais, but I won't participate myself

05:01:44.700 --> 05:01:49.020
Are you still feeling tired? I'm still feeling tired, but I'm a yapper. It's like

05:01:49.820 --> 05:01:53.740
You ever keep talking while you're you're like in bed

05:01:54.540 --> 05:01:56.380
with your friends

05:01:56.380 --> 05:02:01.740
I don't I don't know if this is a universal thing, but you're like still chatting with your friends on discord or something

05:02:01.740 --> 05:02:04.460
And you still have the energy, but you're like, I'm so freaking tired

05:02:14.540 --> 05:02:16.540
So, yeah, um

05:02:25.980 --> 05:02:28.620
I know I know people find it like weird, but like

05:02:29.580 --> 05:02:33.900
Uh, I like sleepovers with my my my my gal pals

05:02:34.780 --> 05:02:36.300
so uh

05:02:36.300 --> 05:02:41.020
Some uh, we'll lay like a little futon for the floor for some girls

05:02:41.820 --> 05:02:47.980
Girls to sleep down on the floor or and then there's a bed that everyone can share as well

05:02:52.460 --> 05:02:53.900
So, yeah

05:02:53.900 --> 05:02:56.140
I don't know. I don't know if most people do that

05:02:56.220 --> 05:03:01.900
But like that's like a thing that my friends do and then we we stay up and then we talk about our lives and we talk

05:03:01.980 --> 05:03:03.980
About anything maybe theory

05:03:04.460 --> 05:03:06.620
Maybe we watch, uh cartoons

05:03:07.100 --> 05:03:09.900
Uh, like we marathon cartoons and stuff

05:03:11.580 --> 05:03:13.580
So

05:03:15.180 --> 05:03:20.860
What do you guys talk about these secret gal pals sleepovers? Oh, yeah, we like summon demons and sacrifice

05:03:21.660 --> 05:03:25.180
Sacrifice are uh a galt just kidding

05:03:41.980 --> 05:03:49.740
It's terrifying right now. Stop. I do hope be allure has have an off collab sleepover

05:03:50.060 --> 05:03:54.940
I really do hope like that. I I really want to like hang out with the girls. Maybe we can do our nails and stuff

05:04:00.700 --> 05:04:03.340
It might take a while though since we're we've got to

05:04:05.020 --> 05:04:08.620
Congregate at one at one place and I'm gonna guess

05:04:09.500 --> 05:04:15.020
We congregate at one place was probably gonna be at scrawny's place. So it might take a little bit of a while

05:04:31.420 --> 05:04:33.420
So I think uh

05:04:34.140 --> 05:04:39.180
No, I think I think we're most likely to likely to go to scrawny's

05:04:39.740 --> 05:04:41.740
uh

05:04:41.980 --> 05:04:43.980
Maybe um

05:04:46.380 --> 05:04:50.620
I'd probably have to rent out if they come to me I'd have to rent out a b&b

05:04:51.900 --> 05:04:55.660
Uh air b&b or or book a hotel room or something

05:04:56.380 --> 05:04:57.660
but

05:04:57.660 --> 05:04:59.660
uh

05:05:00.540 --> 05:05:05.020
But if we go to anywhere anywhere else we'll probably have to do something similar like that

05:05:07.740 --> 05:05:12.300
I mean if off of you allure girls it might be a far travel for some of them as well

05:05:16.220 --> 05:05:18.220
I'm sure it'll be fine

05:05:18.540 --> 05:05:19.500
um

05:05:19.500 --> 05:05:23.740
Just tell your parents very fellow teachers. I think they'll be most likely

05:05:24.540 --> 05:05:31.420
Okay with it if I'm if I'm making a bit of money and then I'm like, okay, I'm going on a little business trip

05:05:31.500 --> 05:05:33.500
They'll be like, yeah, okay, whatever. Bye

05:05:39.900 --> 05:05:44.300
Something like that, I think it'll be really fun and then we can like go out and have girly

05:05:44.940 --> 05:05:48.780
Uh girly like cafe hopping or something. I think that'll be great

05:05:49.420 --> 05:05:51.420
I

05:05:53.180 --> 05:05:57.340
Think it'll be great. I I would love I would love that. I would love to to meet them

05:05:58.780 --> 05:06:04.540
Um, they're also very sweet and I love them very much and I I'm very protective of them like

05:06:05.500 --> 05:06:07.500
I'm very protective of them

05:06:08.940 --> 05:06:13.580
I'm very protective of the girls. So like I feel like you know, if someone

05:06:14.060 --> 05:06:17.340
Hurts their feelings. I'm like that person. They're dead to me

05:06:19.020 --> 05:06:21.020
Oh

05:06:25.180 --> 05:06:26.700
Like oh

05:06:26.700 --> 05:06:30.940
Yeah, and we've all we've all been in calls and stuff and hung out and you know

05:06:32.380 --> 05:06:35.820
It's really nice. It's really nice. I love them. I love them very much

05:06:35.820 --> 05:06:37.820
Uh

05:06:48.380 --> 05:06:52.940
I'm I'm lucky to have my gen maze as my friends as my friends and my gen maze

05:06:55.900 --> 05:07:01.260
I'm really happy because uh, sometimes we talk about things like oh like what do I do like

05:07:02.140 --> 05:07:04.060
You know

05:07:04.060 --> 05:07:06.060
personal things

05:07:08.300 --> 05:07:12.780
We talk about like personal things together and goals and you know

05:07:13.580 --> 05:07:15.580
Um, when we first came in I think

05:07:16.700 --> 05:07:22.220
I think all of us kind of like started to just talk about and kind of gushed scrawny

05:07:23.100 --> 05:07:25.340
About how thankful we were to be here

05:07:25.740 --> 05:07:27.740
Ha ha ha

05:07:30.620 --> 05:07:36.540
Like honestly we were like I'm so happy to be here. I'm so glad that you gave us a chance

05:07:42.700 --> 05:07:45.580
Sometimes we we talk about uh

05:07:46.780 --> 05:07:50.060
What do we talk about we just talk about anything to be honest like oh cool

05:07:50.140 --> 05:07:55.100
Look at this cute lip lip gloss. Wow and everyone's like oh that lip gloss is so cute

05:08:01.340 --> 05:08:06.140
That's kind of that kind of thing, you know, it's fairly normal stuff that we talk about

05:08:08.860 --> 05:08:10.860
Yeah, like something demons

05:08:13.740 --> 05:08:19.420
Sometimes we give each other advice about things like oh, you know, uh, it's my first time doing

05:08:20.060 --> 05:08:26.460
This type of stream. How do I fix it or like oh my audio is being kind of funky? Uh, let's let's troubleshoot it together

05:08:35.900 --> 05:08:37.900
Kind of things like that

05:08:38.860 --> 05:08:42.940
Or if we're like sad about something and you know, we talk about it, you know

05:08:44.380 --> 05:08:49.340
Oh, and of course the girls share their pet their pet uh faultles

05:08:50.300 --> 05:08:52.300
and videos of their pets as well

05:08:53.500 --> 05:08:59.020
It's fairly fairly. Uh, what's the word am I looking for inoculus?

05:09:02.620 --> 05:09:04.620
This is inoculus

05:09:08.060 --> 05:09:09.900
Yeah, it's pretty

05:09:09.900 --> 05:09:11.900
Do I have pets? No

05:09:11.900 --> 05:09:15.980
I don't have pets. Uh mama and papa don't like animals. So I don't have a pet

05:09:16.300 --> 05:09:20.380
How cute are emmy's rats pretty cute

05:09:27.900 --> 05:09:31.420
I love seeing like their pets and sometimes when we're in calls

05:09:32.380 --> 05:09:34.540
Would you get a pet? Maybe

05:09:35.580 --> 05:09:36.940
Um

05:09:36.940 --> 05:09:43.660
Maybe I'm I'm not very familiar with pets since I've never really grown up with any so uh, so that's a maybe

05:09:44.300 --> 05:09:45.260
um

05:09:45.260 --> 05:09:51.340
Depending on financial situation. I might get a pet if I can provide with them the best that I can then I would get a pet

05:09:55.180 --> 05:09:58.460
What pet would you get maybe a cat um or a dog?

05:10:00.060 --> 05:10:02.060
Probably something basic

05:10:02.540 --> 05:10:06.860
Maybe a dog. I'm I'm a little bit of allergic. I'm a little bit allergic to cats

05:10:07.580 --> 05:10:13.340
I'm a little bit allergic to the I think long-haired cats. I sneeze a lot at my eyes, kid. Don't teary

05:10:14.300 --> 05:10:16.300
We're not your pets. Of course you're my pets

05:10:18.220 --> 05:10:23.180
But like if you wanted like a little fluffy fluffy little friend, you know

05:10:29.020 --> 05:10:32.220
What happened to the dog that uses cage before us I bought it new

05:10:32.620 --> 05:10:36.380
All right, I got it off of uh, Facebook marketplace

05:10:46.620 --> 05:10:48.620
It depends how much cage it is

05:10:49.900 --> 05:10:51.900
They're they're not cheap

05:10:52.380 --> 05:10:53.900
I

05:10:53.900 --> 05:10:55.900
Clean it first, of course I cleaned it

05:11:13.660 --> 05:11:15.660
Yeah, I'm so thoughtful

05:11:21.900 --> 05:11:25.420
Brand new cage never used before Facebook

05:11:32.140 --> 05:11:34.140
Only the best for senpai

05:11:37.020 --> 05:11:40.700
I should probably head to bed now though senpai

05:11:52.620 --> 05:12:00.140
Uh the teabag slapped me. That's what I get for joshing around

05:12:10.060 --> 05:12:18.140
So yeah, um, what was I gonna say? Uh, yeah tomorrow is my first time as a mar followed by that. Um

05:12:18.300 --> 05:12:25.420
Uh, I'm gonna sound like a broken record, but some people are new here and I just want to remind everyone

05:12:25.820 --> 05:12:30.380
But after that, it will be a difficult game about climbing. That is going to be a very loud game

05:12:30.380 --> 05:12:34.540
So if you're expecting my soothing voice, you're gonna get a lot more screams instead

05:12:35.740 --> 05:12:44.140
Uh designing jimmies outfits, uh, they're gonna be your kind of rough sketches. So my idea is like, you know, lovely date outfits

05:12:44.540 --> 05:12:46.540
Lovely date outfits

05:12:48.060 --> 05:12:49.900
And uh

05:12:49.900 --> 05:12:53.420
After that is harvester and then deathmark and then the following

05:12:54.140 --> 05:12:58.460
Week after will be a bit of a slowdown slowdown. So I will

05:12:59.500 --> 05:13:01.980
Probably slow down to around three streams

05:13:02.780 --> 05:13:04.780
and then slowly

05:13:04.860 --> 05:13:08.460
slowly build up to five five, uh

05:13:09.260 --> 05:13:11.260
five streams a week, uh, we're uh

05:13:14.860 --> 05:13:18.060
This uh week is full because um

05:13:20.620 --> 05:13:22.460
Because I

05:13:22.460 --> 05:13:27.340
Want to definitely I want to show off off fastest fastest of me to senpai

05:13:28.700 --> 05:13:30.700
And it's debut week. So I want to show off

05:13:31.500 --> 05:13:35.020
fastest, uh, and I don't have anything else to do

05:13:36.300 --> 05:13:40.860
That sounds bad, but I I just I just really want to spend time with everyone

05:13:41.820 --> 05:13:46.300
I I don't have any prior engagements this week as well

05:13:47.580 --> 05:13:52.700
I don't have any prior engagements. Uh next week though, I'll probably on my day off uh days off

05:13:52.700 --> 05:13:55.260
I'll probably catch one chore that I was supposed to do

05:14:02.060 --> 05:14:04.700
I'll probably uh, and then I'll probably uh

05:14:04.700 --> 05:14:06.700
Uh

05:14:07.020 --> 05:14:12.220
Yeah, I'll I'll do chores and do some work on my day on my days off

05:14:12.780 --> 05:14:18.780
It sounds bad doing work on your days off, but it's like, you know things that I'll only take, uh,

05:14:19.420 --> 05:14:21.420
maybe two hours or so

05:14:22.380 --> 05:14:26.220
Like uh to prepare uh things for streams and uh

05:14:27.100 --> 05:14:29.100

05:14:30.380 --> 05:14:32.380
Tell senpai to do his chores

05:14:33.340 --> 05:14:35.340

Uh, uh keep the cages clean. Um

05:15:07.660 --> 05:15:11.260
