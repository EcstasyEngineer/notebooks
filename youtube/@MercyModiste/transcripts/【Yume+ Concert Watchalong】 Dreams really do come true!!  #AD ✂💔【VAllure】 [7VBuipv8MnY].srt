Oh no!

117
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
What?

118
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Wait, what did she say?

119
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,700
I'm pretty sure this is what it's called.

120
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
By that one group.

121
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Ah, Millie!

122
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
You and me are in another edition.

123
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
This suits her so well!

124
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Like her lore!

125
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
She's like a virtual playing doctor!

126
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
This is fantastic!

127
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,700
She's like an anti-virus and everything.

128
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Action!

129
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,700

I love you!

140
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,700
I didn't even know she could turn into Shadow the Hedgehog!

141
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Execution, execution, execution, execution, execution!

142
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Ah, execute me!

143
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
You've already did it!

144
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
I did it!

145
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Ah, you did great!

148
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
It suits her so well!

149
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
It suits her lore so well!

150
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,700
It's so good!

151
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
We said at the same time!

152
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
What song is it?

153
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Da-dee-dee-dee!

154
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Let's go!

155
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Fuck! We lost his voice!

156
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
I mean his voice! Mano's voice!

157
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
They're all so good!

158
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
I love you!

159
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Yay!

160
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,700
Oh, this is a hard song! They are doing it so well!

161
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Why are they so good?

162
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,700
I'm so lucky to be able to do a watch log of this!

163
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
They're doing so good!

164
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Ah!

165
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Mano's so short too!

166
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,700
They have fantastic mics!

167
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Ah!

168
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
I'm so excited!

169
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

170
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Oh!

171
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Her voice is so good!

172
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
I haven't heard her sing yet!

173
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,700
You man! You man unity! You man plus for life!

174
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,700

178
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,700
Oh, what the heck! Her voice is so cute!

179
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Oh!

180
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Why are they all so beautiful?

181
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
Her voice is so beautiful!

182
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,700
Yes!

183
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
She's so good! Her voice is so good!

184
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Why are they all so beautiful?

185
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
The same!

186
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,700
People enjoy their dreams!

187
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
No!

188
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700

191
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Was this the Narissa version? No, it's not the Narissa version!

192
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
I know the Narissa version by heart!

193
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,700
The Narissa version goes...

194
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Give me your love, all of your love!

195
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
This one is not doing that.

196
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,700
I love you! I love you! I love you!

197
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Spain!

198
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,700
No! I'm always painting in love with you!

199
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,700
She's a weeb!

200
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
She's such a weeb! I love her!

201
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,700
I am unfortunately the weirdo who doesn't listen to music!

202
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,700
What song?

203
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,700
What song? What song? What song? What song? Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

204
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Is it magnet? Is it magnet? What song is it? Is it magnet?

205
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
What is it? What is it?

206
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
What is it with it?

207
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
They're bonding!

208
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,700
I know it! I know it! I know it! I know it's magnet!

209
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,700
I know it! I am such a psychic!

210
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,700
I am so... I'm a god!

211
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,700
When I rich version they're gonna do, I wonder if they're gonna do the English version or the JP version.

212
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
I have a song!

213
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
Oh my gosh! It's a mix!

214
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
It's a mix of English and JP!

215
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
What the heck!

216
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
What the heck!

217
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
It's forbidden love!

218
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,700
Oh my gosh, new metal!

219
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:53,700
I love this song! I remember when like every single person sung it and I love the twist that they always did.

220
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,700
I'm so mad annoying!

221
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,700
This is why I didn't want to go on a call with the other girls because I am...

222
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,700
All right! I'm singing the English version now!

223
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,700
Oh her voice is so soft! They're both singing beautifully!

224
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
Never mind!

225
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Never take me to a concert! I'll be embarrassing!

226
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I did it!

227
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
She's so psychic!

228
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,700
Oh, one day I'll stand on you!

229
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
I'll stand on the stage with you, Rain!

230
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Serenity, you and me next for Magnet!

231
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
I love Magnet!

232
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,700
Okay, what's their duet song for this one?

233
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Oh, it's a D- Ah, it's Dian Angel!

234
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,700
I haven't heard Dian Angel for so long!

235
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Ah, Fujoshi!

236
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Let's go! I did it!

237
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:29,700
I don't remember the song so I'm just gonna hum with them and not be annoying as annoying.

238
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Oh my gosh, Fujoshi brain going brrrrrrrr.

239
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,700
Do you like the concert so far? It's amazing!

240
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:57,340
I'm so excited. I'm slapping my pencils together because I don't actually have bad lines.

241
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,340
Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh, what a buildup.

242
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,660
Oh

243
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,580
You feel that that's straight to the heart

244
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Oh

245
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Oh my gosh, what a flashback

246
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Oh

247
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,460
It's like I'm getting memory floods

248
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,380
Ow

249
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,260
I feel

250
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,960
Don't worry, I just hit the pen on my face

251
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
Oh

252
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,820
I got too excited, okay

253
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,980
Oh this guitar solo

254
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,740
You can tell this is like an anime they both really like

255
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,700
Oh

256
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,980
They love it they love the song

257
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Oh

258
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,740
There in places are all too good

259
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
What are they gonna sing next

260
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,980
No, yes, this is the song

261
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,020
Oh

262
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,660
caramel

263
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:57,660
This is a hard song, okay? I even have trouble with the song, too.

264
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:12,660
I'm singing in all Japanese! Good!

265
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:36,660
I'm so excited!

266
00:42:42,660 --> 00:43:06,660
This is such a nice song.

267
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:35,660
Oh my god! I'll never betray you!

268
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,660
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

269
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,660
Wait, that was too early.

270
00:44:36,660 --> 00:45:01,660
I feel so bad that there's no 3D because you would not see my light dance right now using a pencil and a paintbrush.

271
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:26,660
It's so beautiful!

272
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:47,660
Oh, they're singing songs I like, too!

273
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:55,660
