0	5000	What better story than that of a modest young student turned violent yandere overnight?
5000	9000	I didn't always look like this, but maybe you're enjoying the view.
9000	12000	You better be careful staring at me like that.
12000	14000	I might want to call you my next senpai.
14000	17000	Oh, don't ask what happened to the last one.
17000	19000	I'm Mercy Modiste.
19000	22000	Because either way, you'll be screaming for mercy.
22000	27000	I'd say don't be scared of me, but fear is a top shelf ad for DZAC.
27000	30000	Hahahaha!
30000	32000	Oh, come on.
32000	35000	Don't pretend you don't want more of me.
35000	37000	So I better see you on June 1st.
37000	39000	That's when I debut.
39000	41000	Senpai.
