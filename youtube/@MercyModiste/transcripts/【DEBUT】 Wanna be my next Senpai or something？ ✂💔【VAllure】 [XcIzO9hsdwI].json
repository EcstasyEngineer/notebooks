{"text": " it's always one heartbreak after another there are people who just love the drama of relationship but I don't think anyone specifically pines for heartbreak I mean I always give my best I try to be more than fair as a girlfriend but sometimes I get nit thinking that somehow it's all my fault I just can't wrap my head around how that could be possible it's times like this where I try to think back to the start of my love life starting with my first love and first loss maybe try to compare and see where I went wrong this time it started back in early college I was studying to become a fashion designer if you can believe that I wasn't as well deliciously brazen in my outfit choices as I am now a quiet much too overlooked girl who never got invited to parties their loss though I imagine I had more fun sewing crafting and anything else a grandma would do with spare time an old soul people would call me I was content in my own quiet that was until I met my first love I don't know what he saw in me but he was the one to make the first move even before I had the mind to dress to attract the male gaze here I was more of an all-miss chic ghost whatever the reason here was a man who takes charge where he needs to he was a dirty rabid-looking man who stank of booze and ooze failure and degeneracy in retrospect in our first meeting it was a bit more pushy than I'm used to nowadays it's best to understand that the pillar of a strong relationship is setting up boundaries and it's best to do it as soon as possible putting your foot down telling your partner what's what it's a risk you have to take it was because of that I remember that I always keep my fabric scissors with me when you interact with your partner honestly if the love is true they can feel your intent that's when the honest purest part of them comes out my favorite stage in all of my relationships it was like he was a completely different person from his introduction he showed me his true self a part men are taught to hide away the soft sweet vulnerable man inside I mean how could I not fall for him I don't think I have a particular type per se but a man who expresses his emotions in such a delicious way that's something I couldn't resist I just had to have him I had brought him to an old shed my family owns the best I could do at the time but together our love can make it all you see good relationships are built on compromise and I and compromise I did I gave that man everything everything you could ever want I bathed him fed him cared for him gave myself to him the time we spent I gave him all I had to give that's what relationships are I give and take you give your all to someone and you expect them to do the same for you and you know what he does just runs away out of the blue no talking no indication anything is wrong just leaves I couldn't understand I was high off of my affection for him and I thought he was the same but I had to hold in my sadness I for one am better than leaving without a word relationships no matter what should be ended properly after all sometimes relationships don't work out for reasons you don't understand but where there was true love there can be a lot of fun to be had right before cutting ties after that it was fling after fling a new love here and there all ending the same way I hate having to be the nice one in the relationship it can't be my fault I guess men will take any chance to abuse your kindness now the breakup songs on the radio start to make sense and the sweetest sugars are now as bitter as vinegar it's times like this when I think I'm about to give up on love entirely but as they say time heals all wounds after that it feels like the very first time wake up Senpai Senpai wake up oh you're still a bit dizzy
