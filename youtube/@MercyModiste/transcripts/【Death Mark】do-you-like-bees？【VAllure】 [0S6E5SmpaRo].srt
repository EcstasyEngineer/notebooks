1
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,840
I have to go to bed.

2
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:44,640
Uh uh uh uh uh.

3
00:05:44,640 --> 00:06:06,000
to the stream. I'm not feeling so good today. By that I mean my tummy hortie. My tummy hortie.

4
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:23,240
So I may have some extra idol meetings I have to go to. But we're still gaming. Thank goodness

5
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:33,760
this is an easier game. Am I right? Easier game. It's so stressful. It's so stressful.

6
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:58,080
Okay, okay. So what was what was that that we did last time? Okay, so we found Christy.

7
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,120
We found Christy. We brought her back to the mansion. She has she has a deathmark. She doesn't

8
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:26,840
want to die anymore. And we ran away from the big giant bee man. Understood. By the way,

9
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:39,080
there's one thing I'd like to confirm. When I stayed here earlier, you told me the truth

10
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:50,440
you're seeking can be found here. I really doubt this. But do you know the honey bee family had

11
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:58,600
something to do with these marks? His voice shakes slightly with anger. The drama.

12
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,000
But it doesn't faze Mary a bit. I do not have such power.

13
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,200
I simply sense that your fate was entwined with Lord Darlings.

14
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:27,000
I do not know what truth you were seeking, Lord Mashita. But if you remain near Lord Darlings,

15
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:38,040
I predict that you will find it more culpable. Mashita clicks his tongue.

16
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,360
That's just that's that's tongue clicking. Empires, can you click your tongue?

17
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,080
No, not well, I can. I feel like because I can't whisper, I have the ability to click my tongue.

18
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:20,520
I can sound like a ping pong thing.

19
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:37,560
I would only speak in only tongue clicks if it were socially acceptable. I think tongue clicks

20
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:47,240
is considered rude. So I don't do it much. Thank you for the five super.

21
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,880
I can't click my tongue you cut it out after I talk back to you remember. Oh yeah, stay mute.

22
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:15,320
Mercy, can you wish my Serata crit for it? Because when it does become Serata,

23
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:23,400
where therefore it will be, please bless me. What does this mean? What does this mean?

24
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,000
Am I blessing? Am I blessing your like, gotcha rolls?

25
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:45,400
Am I blessing your gotcha roll? By the power of mercy. Chippos, go!

26
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know if it works, sorry.

27
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,920
Got your rolls not guaranteed.

28
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,920
But he isn't scowling anymore, so his curiosity must be satisfied.

29
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,200
What do they have to do with anything?

30
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,800
I just owe them. I just owe them, that's all. Mashita falls silent saying nothing more.

31
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,040
I guess he doesn't want to tell me.

32
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:49,240
Okay, who's our partner? Let's do Kristi Arimura. Yeah, let's go with her blah blah blah. What's in

33
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:59,400
my bag? Baseball bat. Sho had. It's covered in scratches and dents. I've seen a lot of use

34
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,360
off the baseball field, only Sho can use it. Okay. Baseball, or in baseball that Sho had in

35
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,360
his pocket and may be scratched, but the ball itself has been polished white. It's obviously

36
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:16,040
well maintained. Honey Bee Family Note 2, a torn out of a book of H- I don't know about that,

37
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:25,000
a T- point out of a book. In one of the cottages, honey bees are friends. Make them friendly with

38
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,360
medicine from the sprayer. If they get mad, pay attention to the direction the hive is facing.

39
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,840
Awakened, honey bees leave the hive in their direction of the sun. Okay, I feel like

40
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,040
pay attention to the direction the hive is facing. Let me write this down Senpai.

41
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,760
Pay attention.

42
00:12:52,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Hive facing mad and awake.

43
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:20,680
E. Direction of sun. Senpais, you know which direction the sun sets and the sun rises.

44
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,280
Because I totally don't remember.

45
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Sets in the west, rises in the east. Okay.

46
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, we can see the sun? Yeah, you can see it. Every once in a while.

47
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,840
Remember, Japan east is the land of the rising sun. Oh, that's a good way to remember it.

48
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,080
Let's see.

49
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,040
Okay, page torn out of a book in one of the cottages, make hive new bodies, smear honey all

50
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,000
over, ferment honey, get stinky liquid.

51
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,160
Drawn by smell, honey bee enter hive. We got the sprayer, the broken curl bar, and we're done.

52
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,480
Small pressure sprayer. If attached to bottle, you are able to spray drugs. Because of the type

53
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,120
of nozzle, it can't spray very far. It cannot be used on its own. Haddable bottles of medicine

54
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:43,800
must be inserted first. Broken curl bar. Well, shit, it's broken. The curl bar was broken when

55
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,160
used to force a door open. It's not much left in it now, making it hard to use. The broken

56
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,600
edge is sharp and dangerous to touch. We can use it still, stabby wubby.

57
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,080
And then handgun, a police revolver handed over by Mashita. The only bullets left are in the

58
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,640
cartridge. Anyone without any training will have difficulty aiming. Only Mashita can use it.

59
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:17,960
Man, shoot. Anything else? Let's go over Shimeo again. Okay.

60
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,400
Okay, okay, we're doing a recap Senpai. Sorry, I'm doing a recap so I can remember all the hints.

61
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,640
Okay, the forest in Shimeo, known as the Spotted Man or Shimeo, he's covered in dark

62
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:41,720
splotches and asks all he meets if they like bees. Do you like bees? If they say yes, he attacks them

63
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,440
while laughing maniacally. He sounds like you're standard crazy, but I guess he's the next spirit

64
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,480
we'll face at any rate. We'll have to head to the forest to investigate.

65
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,520
Man at the brink of suicide. As we walk past the grave marker, an agitated man named Masao

66
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,040
Kimura appears. Once we got him to calm down, he calls off his plans to kill himself.

67
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Before he leaves, he mentions seeing a man covered in dark splotches. I wonder if he's

68
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:19,720
still around? We should keep moving. Carps in the Cottage. We find a corpse in a burlap sack,

69
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,440
in a cottage in the forest. The strange body is completely covered in what appears to be honey.

70
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,200
It doesn't look like suicide, but who'd do this and why? The cottage is oddly clean,

71
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,640
so someone might be coming here every day. Could it be the culprit?

72
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,280
Maintain a sprayer. I find a sprayer that can shoot a variety of liquids. Then I hear the strange

73
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,560
ghost-like voice again. Manipulators will themselves be manipulated. It keeps coming

74
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,440
out of nowhere and surprising me, but I must admit it has never once lied to me. Maybe it's not

75
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,080
actually an evil spirit. Mysterious Shrine. As we are investigating the forest that black rabbit

76
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:06,120
appears, I quickly chase after it and arrive in an old, leaning torii gate. Is there a shinto shrine

77
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,400
past it? I'd love to investigate, but hives over the gate poured off intruders will have to look

78
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:20,120
elsewhere for now. A marked bearer in a cottage. We quiet the bees with the spray and find a

79
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,840
second cottage further in the forest. No corpse inside this time, but a living woman named Kristi

80
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:33,160
Adimura. A former news anchor. Seems she came to commit suicide, but getting caught up with us in

81
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,240
our circumstances changed her mind. Oddly enough, she already bears the mark. What irony. She most

82
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,800
likely got her mark from Shimiyu while we're discussing it. The flashlight goes out. It's not

83
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,080
malfunctioning. It's just like with Hanehiko. A presence is closing in on the cottage when we

84
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,480
have to get out of here. We have no time to explore and we definitely can't get lost. The shortest

85
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,480
route back to the forest entry entrance is the only way. Temporary retreat. Somehow we get to the

86
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,560
car. We get the car started and speed out of the forest. Before we make it out, we spot two men.

87
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,640
One of them familiar. It was Kimura. His neck twisted awkwardly. He seems dead. The man next

88
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,480
to him was smiling. Was that Shimiyu? The disembodied voices controlled those that are different and

89
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:23,880
exercised them. Easy for them to say. How do I even do that? We learn another truth on her drive back

90
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,880
to the mansion. Mashita, who escaped the mark once already, now has it again. It appears that he

91
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,920
saw what we think is Shimiyu. It's true, then. The spirits are the ones cursing people with the

92
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,800
mark. But it's beyond me why Mashita would risk his life to learn more about the mark. It must

93
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:46,280
have some kind of reason. Temporary retreat. Back at the mansion, Christy tells us of an incident

94
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,520
in the forest she reported on back when she was an anchor. Five years ago, a group of people calling

95
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:59,240
themselves the Honey Bee family lived cut off from society deep in the forest. That is until one day

96
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,240
when they mysteriously committed mass suicide. News reports said they become disillusioned with

97
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,240
society and followed their leader's orders to die. But the police investigation was inconclusive.

98
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,600
The problem lies with the appearance of the leader who was said to have died with him. Christy

99
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,200
says pictures showed him to be a giant obese man. The mass suicide caused the forest to become quickly

100
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:30,520
deserted. This Honey Bee family group concerns me. There were traces of their presence everywhere in

101
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,800
the forest. If you want to survive any unexpected dangers or chance encounters with Shimiyu,

102
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
we need to be careful not to overlook a single detail in this investigation.

103
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:50,600
Yeah, that's it.

104
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,400
Okay, let's save again.

105
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,680
And get out of here.

106
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:14,840
We come to the forest entrance once again.

107
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,920
That man is gone, it seems. I look at the old picnic food.

108
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,600
What was Shimiyu doing back then? Making a corpse sit next to him. It's almost like he was having a picnic.

109
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:40,040
Just one of them? What do you mean? Nothing, sorry. Just talking to myself. Don't worry about it.

110
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,040
Let's go. We haven't learned anything about him yet.

111
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,320
And try changing the subject, but I still can't stop staring at the picnic table.

112
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,080
Okay. Anything new here?

113
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,520
I don't think it's been used in a long time. There's no garbage loaded around either.

114
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,960
If you're around inside the container, my fingers hit something hard.

115
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:17,560
Got an empty bottle. Nice. There's something else too. Pick it up. It's a crumpled piece of paper

116
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:30,040
with Lee family fun play cat. Liquid got on to keep these gather over and over game interrupted.

117
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,520
That's all it says. Is this a diary draft or something?

118
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,240
I thought honeybee family draft.

119
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,360
Oh, at least he threw it in the garbage, I think. Okay, let's go in.

120
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Maybe she can read the stuff. Look, something's written in magic marker.

121
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,360
Maybe opposite of the truth, you'll be followed. See the entrance of the beast trail off to the side.

122
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:17,000
I want to go. Do you remember the second cottage we went to, Senpai? I want to go to that one first.

123
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,800
No spooks. Don't spook me.

124
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:35,720
Yeah, there was more stuff there, so I'm gonna go there. That's where we found the lady. Yeah.

125
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,360
Something's written in Sanskrit, but the letters are blurry. It looks just like a stain.

126
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Let's see the entrance to a beast trail off to the side.

127
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:54,360
There's the gray marker, but nothing's unusual about it. See the entrance?

128
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,880
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it. Okay, let's go here then.

129
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,920
I think we go here. These are quiet here.

130
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:16,120
I think it's over on this side.

131
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,960
Yep, there it is. There's the easel statues. Go in!

132
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,720
I opened the notebook, but most of the pages have been ripped out.

133
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
Doubt it has anything useful.

134
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,240
Open the notebook, but most of the pages have been ripped out.

135
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay, well, useless then. I take all of these. The cabinet is packed full of bottles.

136
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,840
Everything's coated in thin layer of dust. Most of the containers are empty.

137
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,440
I search through the containers and gather ones that have something in them.

138
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,480
Got night night times three.

139
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,480
Yeah, drugs. What about this one?

140
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,120
It looks like maybe a mouse chewed a hole in this plastic container. It's unusable. Shit.

141
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,440
Holy fuck, that scared the shit out of me.

142
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,240
It was an accessory case. This exquisite,

143
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,400
the crafted case. The jewelry inside looks out of place sitting in this cottage.

144
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,680
Thought that was my door. I was like...

145
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,600
Well, there's nothing warning us, so it's probably just fucking sound. Fucking game.

146
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,560
Sometimes gives me like the jump scares.

147
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,200
I open it. There are carefully preserved torn notebook pages inside.

148
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,000
It's a holy journey performed in a quiet place.

149
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,880
In the area past the meeting place, there's a clue about how to get to paradise.

150
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,080
Eastern thickets often got Honey Bee Family Note 3.

151
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,960
Thought this game was relaxing. I did. I said,

152
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,760
yeah, this is a relaxing game. That's super stressful. Oh my gosh, that scared me.

153
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,480
I need a drink my tea.

154
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,000
Somebody hold me senpai. Please hold senpais together.

155
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:49,160
Okay, let's get out of there and hopefully we don't, we don't, you know, run into Shimeo.

156
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,520
Any bitches here? No bitches?

157
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm gonna go straight. I don't think.

158
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,400
Meeting place. Hold on, I'm looking at the items again.

159
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,720
Make hive, new body smear all over.

160
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,720
Play catch.

161
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,320
Area past the meeting place. A clue how to get paradise.

162
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,640
Eastern thickets often.

163
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,880
Well, we're gonna move forward.

164
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,200
The buzzing of bees fills the area. Looks like there's another giant beehive here.

165
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,800
Probably wouldn't be wise to go in without doing something about them first.

166
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,920
Look what I have. I take out the sprayer.

167
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,080
I should be able to use it to spray drugs.

168
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Yeah, drugs.

169
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,760
One night night. Oh wait, no. Was that not it?

170
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,360
Wait, I could have saved. I could have saved.

171
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,960
I could have saved the entire time in this area.

172
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,080
Son of a bitch.

173
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,480
I've been running back to the mansion each time.

174
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,600
Oh, I bet you knew. Shut up.

175
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,080
Shut up.

176
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,320
Okay, well, we'll spray him.

177
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,320
Kill him.

178
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,520
We'll use night night.

179
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,960
I take out night night and put it in the sprayer.

180
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,640
Take careful aim and spray the drug.

181
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,720
The bees movement gets slower. We didn't want a back seat.

182
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,160
I mean, it would have helped.

183
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,520
Eventually the hive falls completely silent.

184
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,480
Used up one bottle of night night.

185
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,440
I've silenced every hive in this area. Now we can pass through.

186
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,320
Pesticides are bad for you.

187
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:02,600
I know. I know. You want, you want some bees in your face.

188
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
No, I don't think so.

189
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,640
Shut up, Christy. Give me a second. I'm gonna move my microphone.

190
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,000
Shut up, Christy. We're doing this for our own safety.

191
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,040
Be careful not to breathe any in. You'll get asthma.

192
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,600
Is that how it works?

193
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,160
Hello, let's go in.

194
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:38,600
Oh, shut the fuck up.

195
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,840
I hear creaks and groans along with the wrestling of leaves.

196
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,160
There you are.

197
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,680
Now, which way do I go?

198
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,000
Map. Do I have a map?

199
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:12,600
Do I go left or right some pie? What do you think?

200
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,640
Right. Okay.

201
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,600
What's this?

202
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:41,320
Don't make, don't make weird sounds. Don't make weird sounds.

203
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,760
There's a thicket growing straight ahead. Look.

204
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,640
Rather dense. There's no way to see what's past it.

205
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,080
Beel.

206
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,800
Pressed through the thick undergrowth.

207
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,440
Notice a small clearing inside.

208
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:04,200
The path might keep going. I realize something as I continue down it.

209
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,200
He said I'm a hawk.

210
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,840
Ghost, don't scare.

211
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:38,520
Is that Reno?

212
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,920
I can feel someone staring at me from the bushes.

213
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,520
I'll fight you. I've got, I've got drugs.

214
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,000
I've got a sprayer and I've got two fingers to go in one eye.

215
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm too much of a coward.

216
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,760
Hey, Christy.

217
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,400
Can you handle it for me?

218
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,880
Please try it.

219
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:17,960
Me?

220
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,680
Christy, you do it.

221
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,360
You in Utah.

222
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,000
I, I guess I'll have to.

223
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
She faces the figure and offers up a prayer.

224
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,920
No way it worked.

225
00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:07,560
Ah, let me just tell you being a coward has its perks.

226
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:22,280
I didn't believe in her either, but it worked.

227
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,000
The figure vanishes.

228
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,800
It, it disappeared.

229
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:40,600
Have a little faith, Mercy. I didn't think that would work. I was a fucking coward.

230
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,680
It seemed her desperate prayer worked.

231
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,640
Thank goodness.

232
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,040
It didn't possess me.

233
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,680
Good job, I think.

234
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,760
I don't know.

235
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,160
I don't know how it worked.

236
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,600
Let's keep going.

237
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,600
Holy shit, is that?

238
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,600
The diesel statue is damaged from being exposed to the elements for so long.

239
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,480
Can I touch it?

240
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,400
Is that motherfucking blood?

241
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:37,960
I don't like that senpai.

242
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,640
I don't want to.

243
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,600
I don't want to.

244
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,240
That's, that's so blood, isn't it?

245
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,240
It's a wooden door.

246
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,680
Look, the door here is in that damage. No need for me to break it open.

247
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,040
Can I, why isn't my, my X button working?

248
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,520
I can't save.

249
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,560
Suppose I can't save.

250
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:17,880
It's okay.

251
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
College door is locked.

252
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,760
Son of a bitch.

253
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,720
Well, I can't go there anymore.

254
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,040
Um.

255
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,560
Let's move forward.

256
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,760
Um.

257
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,920
Should we go left or what was, should we go straight or right?

258
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,680
Straight, right?

259
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,400
Didn't say it wasn't locked.

260
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,680
Yeah, said it was.

261
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:05,480
Let's go straight.

262
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,800
The buzzing of bees fill the area.

263
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,840
Looks like there's another giant beehive here.

264
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,600
Probably wouldn't be wise to keep going without doing something about them first.

265
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,760
I take out the sprayer and hold it in one hand.

266
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,240
Should be able to use it to spray drugs.

267
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,920
We have enough.

268
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,160
Oh no!

269
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,160
Hey, the wrong button I hit feel!

270
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,960
Uh, tool.

271
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:55,720
Night night.

272
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,920
I'll take out night night and put it in the sprayer.

273
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,640
A careful, I take careful aim and spray the drug.

274
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,200
The bees movements get slower.

275
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,200
Eventually the hive falls completely silent.

276
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,680
Used up one bottle of night night.

277
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,600
Shit.

278
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,880
I don't have enough drugs.

279
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,080
Need one more.

280
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,120
Where do I get one more?

281
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,880
Well, I'm sure we'll find more.

282
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,600
Well, I gotta choose one of these, I guess.

283
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:02,520
It's probably an empty bottle.

284
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,960
We can figure out how to make,

285
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,960
make, uh, new night night.

286
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,600
We have to cook, yeah.

287
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Yeah, there's one more.

288
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,760
Okay, we can't continue on.

289
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,640
Maybe it's in the lock shifter?

290
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,280
Probably.

291
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,040
We'll have to find something then.

292
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,720
I think we went this way yet.

293
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:46,920
Did we?

294
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
No, we didn't.

295
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,920
Hello?

296
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,000
A sweet fragrance wafts from the,

297
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,960
on the wind from somewhere in the darkness.

298
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,960
At my feet are what looks like beehives.

299
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:24,840
There must be what remains of a bee farm.

300
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,720
Why are they so fit?

301
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,640
Weird.

302
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,800
It's like this is here of all places.

303
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,360
Okay, uh, if they're mad.

304
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,400
Um, pay attention to the direction the bees are facing.

305
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,920
Okay, left, right, south.

306
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,640
Awake, bees are awake in the direction of the sun.

307
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,920
East, that's the last one.

308
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,440
Okay, let's figure this out.

309
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,520
Well, may as well have a look around.

310
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,840
I don't like that.

311
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,840
Gangling from the tree are human corpses.

312
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,800
I don't like that.

313
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,680
The skin is as white as wax.

314
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,840
Countless holes are drilled in the bodies and bees are buzzing in and out of them.

315
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,000
My mind flashes to the corpse in the cottage.

316
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,920
It's just like that one.

317
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,320
Christy is looking away.

318
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,560
How horrible.

319
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,280
Why would anyone do this?

320
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,680
The beehive at my feet starts to rattle.

321
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,680
Oh, no.

322
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,880
A pitch black cloud suddenly rises up, overwhelming my vision.

323
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,560
Something invades my eyes and nose.

324
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,240
It's a swarm of bees?

325
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,680
Oh, oh, girls, oh, madma bees!

326
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,680
Eek!

327
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
No, stay away from me!

328
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Oh, fuck!

329
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Live or die!

330
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
Even more bees are coming from the hives.

331
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Oh, fuck.

332
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Which hive should I close first?

333
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
Oh, fuck.

334
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Which hive should I close first?

335
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Wait, what?

336
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,680
What do you mean, which hive should I close first?

337
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
Oh, thank you, secret, for the five gifted.

338
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Ah!

339
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Ah!

340
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
The one at your feet, so the middle one.

341
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
So the south one, right?

342
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,680
Okay.

343
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
Yeah, close the one by your feet first.

344
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Okay, yeah, they are directions just like how the story said.

345
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,680
I have been somehow managed to close the lid, but...

346
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,680
These descend from me from all sides.

347
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
They must have swarmed from out from another beehive.

348
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Ah, it was wrong!

349
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Ah, it was wrong!

350
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,680
Check for more active hives.

351
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,680
What do you mean?

352
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Ah!

353
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
Ease?

354
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
I dive at the hive and close the lid.

355
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,680
I hear the disgusting sound of bees being crushed.

356
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
I guess I was able to steal the hive in time.

357
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
Okay, okay.

358
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,680
I might die.

359
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,680
I might die, Senpai.

360
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
I might die, so the first one was not self.

361
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,680
So this one was east.

362
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,680
The second one is east, is correct.

363
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,680
There's only one left.

364
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
I carefully sneak close to the hive

365
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,680
and manage to close the lid.

366
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Lukewarm liquids burst everywhere, like a grape bursting in my hand.

367
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Seeding closing the hive

368
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
right before the bees barked out of it.

369
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Still safe?

370
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,680
Check for more active hives.

371
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,680
What?

372
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680
After I close all the little hives,

373
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,680
the bees finally quiet down.

374
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,680
I survived!

375
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,680
That was my bad.

376
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
That was close.

377
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,680
Yeah, you're telling me.

378
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,680
That was probably east.

379
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,680
West.

380
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,680
West.

381
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
West.

382
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
West.

383
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
West.

384
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
West.

385
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,680
West.

386
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
West.

387
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,680
There's probably east, west, then south.

388
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,680
Oh, man.

389
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Right, because of the sun direction.

390
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,680
But how would we know which one to have closed?

391
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,680
Would have been where the sun rises,

392
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,680
the sun sets, and then whatever.

393
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,680
East, south, then west.

394
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,680
Why would it be south?

395
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,680
And then west.

396
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,680
West.

397
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,680
We crouch there for a while

398
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,680
until we catch our breath.

399
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,680
Clockwise on a compass.

400
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,680
In between rise and set.

401
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,680
Oh, right, like a clock.

402
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,680
Wow, I'm stupid.

403
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,680
Right.

404
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
That makes sense.

405
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
That makes sense.

406
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,680
That makes sense.

407
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
You're right. Wow.

408
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
I didn't even think about that.

409
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
It's okay, I saw bees and I was like,

410
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Ah, bees!

411
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,680
Do I dare touch the bees?

412
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,680
Look.

413
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,680
There are countless holes drilled in them.

414
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,680
The holes seem to have a spiral pattern.

415
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,680
Must have been intentional.

416
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,680
A thick liquid drips from them.

417
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,680
The smell. I can't describe how horrible it is.

418
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,680
The bees are gathering on it.

419
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,680
What's that liquid?

420
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,680
Seems that liquid attracts bees.

421
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,680
I had a suitable container.

422
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,680
I could gather some of it.

423
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,680
The stinky liquid!

424
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,680
The stinky liquid!

425
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,680
I take out the empty bottle and gather some of the dripping liquid in it.

426
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,680
That's stinky liquid.

427
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Nothing seems out of ordinary.

428
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,680
Looks like a normal beehive.

429
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,680
Open the beehive.

430
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,680
There's a bottle of drug amongst the form.

431
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,680
A large bottle of sweet dreams!

432
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,680
Playball has a warning on it.

433
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,680
Do not mix dangerous.

434
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,680
Mixing sweet dreams and night night is extremely dangerous for family.

435
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,680
Cannot be used with sprayer.

436
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,680
Oh, shit.

437
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,680
Look. Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

438
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,680
Looks like a normal beehive.

439
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,680
Can I open up the beehive?

440
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,680
These are just crawling around inside it silently.

441
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,680
Anything else?

442
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,680
We've got the stinky liquid.

443
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,680
Open the beehive.

444
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,680
These are just crawling around it silently.

445
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,680
No?

446
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,680
You know what?

447
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,680
Inside of the holes.

448
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Okay, blah blah blah.

449
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,680
The corpse is clutching something in its hand.

450
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,680
I try to open the fingers.

451
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,680
Cottage key!

452
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,680
Cottage key. We got it!

453
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,680
When I put the key in my bag, my wrist burns in pain.

454
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,680
Mark burns scarlet.

455
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,680
Half an hour left until death closes in.

456
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,680
Time is a construct in this game.

457
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,680
And I'm going to spend way more!

458
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,680
Way longer!

459
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,680
I felt this before.

460
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,680
Both sweat drips down my back.

461
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,680
I suddenly remember what happened at age elementary.

462
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,680
The Mark's symptoms accelerated

463
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,680
and the person with me began acting strangely.

464
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,680
Hey, Kristie?

465
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,680
Spin around and look at them.

466
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,680
What?

467
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,680
The stairs at me puzzled.

468
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,680
Are you feeling okay?

469
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,680
Yes, I feel perfectly normal.

470
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,680
I need to hurry, you know.

471
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,680
Right.

472
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,680
It doesn't seem like she's changed at all.

473
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,680
I don't understand what's going on,

474
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,680
but if she's fine, that's great news.

475
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,680
New info was added to the Spirit Fire.

476
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,680
Human defile.

477
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,680
Okay, why?

478
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,680
Why can I not record now?

479
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,680
Why can I not?

480
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,680
Senpai!

481
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,680
Senpai!

482
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,680
Thank you for the super chat.

483
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,680
Thank you for the 5 super chat demand.

484
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,680
Why do the high bodies not have legs?

485
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,680
Where are their bees' knees?

486
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,680
I...

487
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,680
I disliked that.

488
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,680
I disliked that.

489
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,680
I disliked that.

490
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,680
I disliked that.

491
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,680
Okay, now, can we use it now?

492
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,680
Use the Cottage Key to open the door.

493
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,680
An overly sweet smell

494
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,680
permeates the inside of the cottage.

495
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,680
Pretty sure it's...

496
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,680
Honey, huh?

497
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Oh no, not again!

498
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,680
No! Not another body bag!

499
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,680
No!

500
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,680
My eyes fall on a white object

501
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,680
that was carelessly left lying around.

502
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,680
That can't be.

503
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Aw...

504
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,680
Don't tell me...

505
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,680
You're thinking about opening that...

506
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,680
Have to check it out.

507
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,680
No, I don't!

508
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,680
No, I don't have to check it out!

509
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,680
We don't have much time left.

510
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,680
Well, I'm gonna grab everything else first.

511
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,680
Look.

512
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,680
Family won't die if they're dreaming.

513
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,680
Wake them and hit them.

514
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,680
Do it until they calm down.

515
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,680
Be careful, everyone.

516
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,680
When they wake up, family is only human.

517
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,680
Family won't die if they're dreaming.

518
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,680
Blah, blah, blah. Wake them up.

519
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,680
And hit them. Do it until they calm down.

520
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,680
I had to get... Okay, that's the hint!

521
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,680
Be careful, everyone.

522
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,680
It's like some useful information.

523
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,680
Should I rip it out and take it with me?

524
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,680
Yes! Take it!

525
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,680
More night night.

526
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,680
The bottle's a cracked damage.

527
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,680
I don't think I can use them. Fuck.

528
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,680
Inside of the container is corroded.

529
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,680
I don't think I can use it. Fuck!

530
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,680
It's a small container.

531
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,680
Ugly lady is written in faded marker.

532
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,680
Let's be someone ID of a prank.

533
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,680
Open the container.

534
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,680
Inside is something that looks like a dried tree root.

535
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,680
Fuck.

536
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,680
Dried root.

537
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,680
A scrap of paper stuck to the tree root with wire.

538
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,680
Everyone's gone.

539
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,680
I'm all alone now.

540
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,680
I want to see everyone.

541
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,680
My head is so foggy.

542
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
I can't remember how.

543
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,680
I think the last thing I need to do is combine those two.

544
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,680
But...

545
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
Oh my gosh.

546
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Two what?

547
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,680
What are we gathering two of?

548
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,680
Root plus what?

549
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,680
Stinky liquid?

550
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Reformed in a quiet place in the area past the meeting place.

551
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,680
What's the meeting place?

552
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,680
Is the meeting place the other way around?

553
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,160
I don't know if it's the right way.

554
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,680
Combine Night Night and Sweet Dreams maybe?

555
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,680
No, that's not right!

556
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,680
It has to be the root.

557
00:53:52,680 --> 00:54:06,440
for mint honey get spanky liquid drawn by smell these enter high with family fun

558
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:15,400
play catch liquid got on sticky these gather over over game interrupted don't

559
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:30,520
know maybe it is root and honey maybe it's root and spanky liquid a big burlap

560
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:38,640
side sack is slung against the wall incredibly lumpy making it easy to

561
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:48,520
determine it's holding something just then something inside the bag

562
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:58,400
keep squirming intermittently why is it moving a cold sweat breaks out on my

563
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,480
forehead I hesitatingly reach for the mouth of the bag putting my breath I

564
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:12,880
slowly open it not again a secondingly sweet smell

565
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:34,040
hits us the corpse currently becoming a beehive no is that Kimura

566
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:43,560
it's completely unrecognizable at this point but I intuitively know who it is

567
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:48,520
Masao Kimura who was sitting on the bench was shimeo and wanted to commit

568
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:58,360
suicide this is one of my worst nightmares not gonna lie like yeah things

569
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:08,040
getting out of the holes body yeah gross

570
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,360
maybe they're burrowing into holes all over his body diligently making their

571
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:18,520
hind faint noise we heard came from the bag must have been the buzzing of beads

572
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:25,320
this is beyond saying has to be the work of shimeo once it's complete another

573
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:31,880
object art will be added to that repulsive beef farm just then I noticed

574
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,200
some objects stuffed next to the corpse mismatch item seems like burial

575
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,480
accessories for the dearly departed tennis ball large bottle of night night

576
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:54,080

578
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:13,080
days the swarm I do that with what I've found so far we return Masao's bar

579
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,360
corpse to the bag give him a proper burial but there's no time for that

580
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:25,800
right hey hey can I say something Christy's expression is grave your face

581
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,640
is flushed with shame I know full well that it's far too late to be saying

582
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:38,520
this but I can't stand it I can't take any more of us wait what if we've run

583
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:45,680
into this monster no way will I be able to do anything wait what I'm not getting

584
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:53,160
whatever I said on TV is totally meaningless here in this force sorry but

585
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,400
I can't help you anymore

586
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:18,260
I guess I have to go back I know this is out of the blue but I thought it was

587
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,580
now or never really I'm sorry but I just can't do this

588
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:29,060
as he stumbles over multiple apologies no there's nothing to apologize for normal

589
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:35,220
in situations like this any regular person would react the same oh everyone

590
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:40,540
would want to run as far as like the profession carries dangerous consequence

591
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:49,620

595
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:11,700

596
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:18,420
well there's some more stuff here inside the small box but outside is covered in

597
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,260

604
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:10,140
was there anything in the front cuz I was thinking about like areas where they

605
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:15,940
were having you know where they were like oh what's this the end of the path of

606
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:20,740
meetings might be the area past the meeting place mentioned in the note

607
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:23,780
push through the undergrowth yeah this is where I was like you know meeting

608
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:29,060
places right kind of beast trail leading to the east

609
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,460
the ghost of a man stands blocking your way staring silently the figures

610
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,980
glaring harshly at both of us

611
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:49,540
hey that's over a show but there's probably nothing that can be done woman

612
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,340
woman woman woman woman woman immediately pushed back by a strong

613
01:01:54,340 --> 01:02:07,700
no way ain't no fucking way I need Christy

614
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,860
I can't believe it Christy come back with me

615
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:35,700
just a second okay just a second okay

616
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:47,700
I can't fucking believe it

617
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:57,060
I just need you for one last thing and then I'll get the guys don't worry

618
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:09,060

619
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:16,900
ask your partner me I can't I can't do that but when she faces the figure and

620
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,860
offers up a prayer

621
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:25,940
why did that fucking work the figure vanishes

622
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:33,060
oh thank goodness I guess the ghost was glad to see a woman

623
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,340
I mean I get the I guess the goal the ghost was glad to see a woman

624
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:43,380
it's like my prayer got through to it then prayers come in handy sometimes huh

625
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,260
let's keep going

626
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:51,380
is there anything around here

627
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,860
what's this

628
01:03:54,740 --> 01:04:00,100
looks like the flower was blooming the leaves are distinctly pointed

629
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,780
the plant is inspected but nothing seems out of ordinary about it

630
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:08,420
fruit is still firmly lodged in the soil playing on it does nothing

631
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,220
maybe I can use a tool on it doesn't look like it's being used

632
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,580
anymore there aren't any bees anywhere

633
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,420
hopefully open it up the side is a photo scrap of paper it's something that

634
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:26,820

635
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:31,460

I dig it out with like the broken crowbar

639
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,060
it got the broken crowbar and pressed in the dirt by the plant

640
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,660
dirt is softer than I expected the pointed end

641
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:02,660
usually breaks it up if I only get to the root it's kind of like a

642
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:07,300
small carrot but that root

643
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:17,300
huh why are you going to do with that I don't fucking know

644
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:30,340
I guess that was the meeting

645
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:35,620
there was a thing to mix with the root right yeah

646
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:44,180

filled with liquid dripping from a corpse smells bitter

655
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,620
sweet and extremely thick this is probably what attracts the ease

656
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:35,460
sweet dreams do not make dangerous not compatible sprayer

657
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:42,020

01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,540
So we got that.

687
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,540
We got our homie.

688
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,300
What's the tool? Yeah.

689
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,420
OK, but now we have more night night.

690
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,540
So if we go forward.

691
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,300
Here.

692
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,300
Yeah.

693
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:54,020
And we go here and then turn left, right?

694
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,020
Yeah.

695
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:01,220
No, we did not.

696
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:06,780
It's great.

697
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,820
Great.

698
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,380
Yeah.

699
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,540
Was it right?

700
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,140
No.

701
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,540
Uh.

702
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,700
It's great.

703
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,700
I think I was here.

704
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:37,660
Yeah, let's go.

705
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,060
Yeah.

706
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,900
Let's spray with night night.

707
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,500
Yeah, take careful aim and spray the drug.

708
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,900
OK, the bees movement got slower.

709
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,340
Eventually, the high falls completely silent.

710
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,540
Used up one bottle of night night.

711
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,060
I've silenced every hive in the area.

712
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,060
Now we can pass through.

713
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,620
They're all dead.

714
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,460
I don't think so.

715
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,940
I think they're all sleeping, right?

716
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,340
Jesus.

717
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,580
Fucking hate this.

718
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,940
Nothing.

719
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,780
Damn, thanks for the thanks for the sound.

720
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,900
OK.

721
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:45,980
OK.

722
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,420
Three of women corpses that's been turned into hives.

723
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,180
The buzz of bees fill the air.

724
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,460
And look, the drug should easily be able to reach it.

725
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,660
Actually, wait, I'm too close.

726
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,980
We shouldn't breathe in the stuff.

727
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,780
I touched this.

728
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:10,380
The drugs should easily be able to reach it.

729
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,980
Drugs.

730
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,380
No, I can't think of a way to use it.

731
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,780
What do we use, Senpai?

732
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,780
There might be something back in the shed again.

733
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,780
I don't think so.

734
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:56,780
The sticky liquid?

735
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,780
Doesn't that attract bees?

736
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,780
Sweet dreams?

737
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,780
No.

738
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:14,780
It's too big.

739
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:22,780
Maybe another night night?

740
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,780
OK.

741
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,780
I used up one bottle and night night.

742
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,780
Shit, I'm low on night night.

743
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,780
Nothing seems out of ordinary.

744
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,780
Looks like a normal beehive.

745
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,780
A lot of drugs fit inside the beehive.

746
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,780
Good morning.

747
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,780
Good morning.

748
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,780
Good morning.

749
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,780
I don't know why, like, scanning.

750
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:57,780
It was like, we're too close for drugs.

751
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:59,780
Uses drugs anyways.

752
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,780
Shit.

753
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,780
Mark has died in a deep crimson.

754
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,780
A few minutes left until death closes in.

755
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,780
Aw, shit.

756
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,780
The mark scorches me again.

757
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,780
It's like we're out of time.

758
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,780
I face myself like Lance over at show.

759
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:30,780
Show.

760
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:31,780
I'm counting on you.

761
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,780
Why are you...

762
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:33,780
I...

763
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,780
What were we supposed to mix?

764
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,780
I didn't have...

765
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,780
Aw, I don't have it.

766
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,780
Sorry, this is going to hurt.

767
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,780
I slap show's face.

768
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,780
Ow!

769
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,780
Oh, man, you little...

770
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,780
Near your head a little.

771
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,780
Coming.

772
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,780
We have to go.

773
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,780
We'll do everything we can,

774
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:38,780
but you have to do as I say.

775
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,780
Yeah, okay.

776
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,780
I proceed to lead show into the darkness.

777
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:54,780
Where was I supposed to go?

778
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:55,780
Shit!

779
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:59,780
Gifting on the wind from somewhere

780
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:02,780
is the meltingly sweet fragrance of honey.

781
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,780
New info was added to the spirit file.

782
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,780
Tracing female.

783
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:14,780
Fuckin' bees!

784
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,780
Oh, hi!

785
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:23,780
Something flies at us in the dark.

786
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:30,780
Sharp paint pierces the arm I used to cover my face.

787
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,780
I think I got stung by a bee.

788
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,780
I don't know how to do this,

789
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:36,780
but he said hit him, right?

790
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:50,780
Was...

791
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,780
Sorry, senpai.

792
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,780
Was that loud sound from the game,

793
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:03,780
or was that something from upstairs?

794
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,780
Oh, my gosh.

795
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:09,780
Bees swarm around chimio.

796
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,780
As he draws closer,

797
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:13,780
I won't survive being attacked again.

798
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,780
Just worry that mama.

799
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:19,780
Okay, give me a second.

800
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:20,780
Sorry.

801
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:24,780
Sorry, senpai.

802
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,780
I'm just gonna double check to make sure

803
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,780
that mama, mama, and papa are okay.

804
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,780
I'll be back, okay?

805
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,780
It's okay to leave it like this, right?

806
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:41,780
Okay, hold on.

807
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,780
Just be right back.

808
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:55,780
Okay.

809
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:25,780
Okay.

810
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:55,780
Okay.

811
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:25,780
Okay.

812
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:55,780
Okay.

813
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,780
Okay.

814
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:56,780
Okay.

815
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,780
Sorry, senpai.

816
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,780
There's a big storm outside,

817
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,780
like super big storm,

818
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,780
like lightning everywhere.

819
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:14,780
So I think

820
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,780
I'm gonna have to cut it pretty short today

821
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,780
because I don't think it's a good idea

822
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,780
to like have my computer on

823
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:25,780
and if it like,

824
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,780
you know, if the lightning does it,

825
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:31,780
does like hit something,

826
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,780
I don't wanna lose any data

827
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,780
or like ride my computer.

828
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,780
So it's like huge storm right now

829
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:48,780
and the sound that I heard was actually like thunder,

830
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,780
like really loud thunder.

831
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,780
I was like, holy fuck.

832
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,780
So yeah, I'm gonna do this real quick

833
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,780
and then we'll have to cut it short.

834
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:57,780
Short.

835
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,780
Sorry, senpai.

836
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,780
Okay.

837
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:03,780
I won't survive being attacked either.

838
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,780
It must be pretty close, yeah.

839
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,780
Fuck, I don't know.

840
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:13,780
Um...

841
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:20,780
Fuck.

842
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,780
Uh...

843
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:45,780
Baseball!

844
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:47,780
And uh...

845
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,780
Baseball bat.

846
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,780
No, spear's too far away to try this.

847
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:54,780
Never mind.

848
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:55,780
Uh...

849
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:01,780
Night night.

850
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,780
And...

851
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:07,780
No.

852
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:12,780
Good morning?

853
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:13,780
Sticky liquids?

854
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,780
Sticky liquids.

855
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,780
Okay.

856
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:17,780
You want stinky liquids, senpai?

857
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:18,780
And what else?

858
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,780
What else should we do?

859
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,780
Stinky liquid and...

860
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:24,780
And what?

861
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:30,780
Baseball?

862
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:32,780
We...

863
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,780
Apply the liquid to the baseball?

864
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,780
And then just be like, yay!

865
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:49,780
I guess we can do that.

866
01:23:58,780 --> 01:23:59,780
Yeah, that's gonna work.

867
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:01,780
Yeah, let's throw it!

868
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:04,780
And pour the stinky liquid over...

869
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,780
Stinky liquid over the tennis ball and throw it.

870
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,780
Timo incites the bee.

871
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,780
The bee's cloud rush at the ball.

872
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:16,780
Must be reacting to the smell of the liquid on it.

873
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,780
Bee's form the ball.

874
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,780
They look like a dense black cloud.

875
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:22,780
Okay, okay, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it.

876
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:24,780
Uh, shit.

877
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:26,780
Liquid again.

878
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:29,780
And uh...

879
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:30,780
The baseball.

880
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:47,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

881
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,780
Okay, I'm waiting.

882
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:50,780
Waiting senpai.

883
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:53,780
He's a little...

884
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:54,780
Close?

885
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:55,780
Yeah?

886
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:56,780
He's not close yet.

887
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:57,780
Should we hit him?

888
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,780
Should we hit him?

889
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:03,780
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

890
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:04,780
I want to make this quick.

891
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,780
Bees aren't coming back, right?

892
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:10,780
Well, maybe.

893
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,780
I don't know how many bees he has.

894
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:16,780
We should use something else?

895
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:23,780
He's not close enough yet.

896
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:27,780
Whatever, I'm going to do it again.

897
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,780
We have two of them, so we're going to do it twice.

898
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,780
Yeah, yeah, we need...

899
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:37,780
We can't hit him yet because he's not close enough yet.

900
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,780
Yeah, fuck it.

901
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:42,780
Throw the ball.

902
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,780
Yeah.

903
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,780
Chimmyo incites the bees.

904
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, okay, it's true.

905
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,780
The bee cloud rushes at the ball again.

906
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,780
I just remembered the last one.

907
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:05,780
I guess the second ball was effective too.

908
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:08,780
Oh, gosh, you're ugly.

909
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,780
Okay, uh, we were very close.

910
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:15,780
Fuck.

911
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,780
I have two of these.

912
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,780
Can we wake the bees up again?

913
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,780
We hit him, right?

914
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,780
Hold on.

915
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:52,780
Sorry.

916
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,780
I'm so glad that we can still do this.

917
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:55,780
Hold on.

918
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:02,780
We're not mixed.

919
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:03,780
Dangerous.

920
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:07,780
Wake them up and hit them.

921
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,780
Okay, I think that one's right.

922
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:10,780
Yeah, wake them up and hit them.

923
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:14,780
Yeah.

924
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:29,780
I cut open the body and a bitter sweet smelling liquid pours out.

925
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,780
Oh, I am not a traitor.

926
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,780
Chimmyo bends over backwards moaning liquid sprays from the holes in his body.

927
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,780
Chimmyo falters.

928
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,780
Do we do it again?

929
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,780
I'm gonna do it again.

930
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,780
I'm gonna fucking do it again.

931
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:56,780
I'm gonna do it again.

932
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:04,780
Spray Chimmyo with the drug and hit him with the base on that.

933
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,780
Chimmyo is wounded.

934
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,780
Chimmyo rides in pain.

935
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:11,780
His body jiggling.

936
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:14,780
Oh, I don't want to wake up.

937
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:17,780
Chimmyo hollers in pain as he gets hit,

938
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,780
but this doesn't seem enough to beat him.

939
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,780
Chimmyo is weak.

940
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:26,780
Chimmyo is clearly weak.

941
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:27,780
Now's the time to finish him off.

942
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:30,780
Give me a second.

943
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,780
Are we going for the bad end or good end?

944
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:35,780
Hopefully good end!

945
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:40,780
I gotta check the notes though.

946
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,780
Where's the notes?

947
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,780
That one.

948
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:03,780
Which route? Which route?

949
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:10,780
Which route?

950
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,780
A plan with something.

951
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,780
I don't know.

952
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:26,780
I don't know what I need.

953
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:31,780
We need to wake him up, right?

954
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:41,780
What jar of honey?

955
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:42,780
We don't have a jar of honey!

956
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,780
You want this route?

957
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:01,780
And this route?

958
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:05,780
Two routes!

959
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:06,780
Both routes!

960
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:07,780
Let's go!

961
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:09,780
Is it going to work?

962
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,780
Darling throws the route into Chimmyo's mouth.

963
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:15,780
It was infected.

964
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,780
Chimmyo slowly munches on the dried root

965
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,780
and with a loud gulp, smalls it.

966
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:23,780
This isn't enough.

967
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:25,780
It's really not enough.

968
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:27,780
I don't know what to do.

969
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:29,780
I don't know what to do.

970
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:31,780
I don't know what to do.

971
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:33,780
I don't know what to do.

972
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:35,780
It's not really noticing.

973
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:36,780
It's different.

974
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:37,780
It doesn't seem effective.

975
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:38,780
Fuck!

976
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:41,780
What about the dried...

977
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:42,780
dried root?

978
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,780
Let's just act it.

979
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:45,780
Lunches on the dried root

980
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:46,780
will allow gulp, smalls it.

981
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,780
Ah, shit.

982
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,780
Weakened by the attack,

983
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:57,780
Chimmyo shakes but musters the lock of the screen.

984
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,780
Ah, shit.

985
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,780
Ah, shit.

986
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:07,780
What? Where is the honey?

987
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:10,780
Beesworm out of holes in Chimmyo's body

988
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:12,780
and spring his entire body.

989
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:14,780
RIP me.

990
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:16,780
My vision darkens.

991
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,780
I can see the spirit slowly drawing closer.

992
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:29,780
Game over.

993
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:30,780
And unfortunately,

994
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,780
because that is a game over,

995
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,780
I have to probably go down.

996
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,780
We ended on a loss!

997
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:40,780
We need to find the honey, I guess.

998
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:41,780
Yeah.

999
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:43,780
Oh, shit.

1000
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:47,780
Yeah, actually, this is what I need.

1001
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,780
Save.

1002
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,780
Ah, wait.

1003
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:57,780
Yeah, I need to save.

1004
01:31:58,780 --> 01:31:59,780
Save.

1005
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:01,780
Save.

1006
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,780
Oh, wait.

1007
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,780
Yeah, I need to end.

1008
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:04,780
Here.

1009
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,780
We'll come back, we'll get him.

1010
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,780
Sorry about that, everyone.

1011
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,780
I was so sure that we'll have things,

1012
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:14,780
but I can literally Senpai.

1013
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,780
I saw my lights flash,

1014
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:18,780
so I think we gotta go.

1015
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,780
I think we gotta go.

1016
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,780
So...

1017
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:35,780
Oof, let's make this real quick.

1018
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:39,780
Thank you, everyone, for joining me today.

1019
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,780
I'm so sorry that suddenly,

1020
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:44,780
like, it's super thundery and stuff,

1021
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:46,780
so we gotta go.

1022
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,780
Yeah, the stream has been stuttering for me

1023
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,780
for the last 30 minutes or so.

1024
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:57,780
Okay, it might be because of the storm outside.

1025
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:03,780
So, we're gonna just go really quickly

1026
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:06,780
over my schedule, remaining schedule.

1027
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:08,780
I only have one more day.

1028
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:11,780
So, tomorrow I have day off.

1029
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:14,780
Friday is my members' only stream.

1030
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,780
I saw some new members here.

1031
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:18,780
I'm sorry I wasn't able to thank you quick enough

1032
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:22,780
because the members actually went too fast by.

1033
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:25,780
But thank you so much for all those who member.

1034
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:29,780
Remember, if you are on the members' tier,

1035
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:31,780
you will have access to the stream.

1036
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,780
We are playing SMT Nocturne.

1037
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:40,780
Also known as Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne,

1038
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,780
very, very fun game.

1039
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,780
We're going to study a lot of the folk lords

1040
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,780
and all the creatures in it.

1041
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:50,780
And so, yeah, we'll have a lot of fun with that,

1042
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,780
and I hope it will be memberable for you.

1043
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:59,780
So, with that, let me quickly see who's on.

1044
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:03,780
Hopefully, someone is on so I can send you guys there.

1045
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:11,780
I think Mimosa is doing an 8-hour gaming thing.

1046
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,780
So, we'll send you over to Mimosa.

1047
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:19,780
Since Mimosa is trying to get monetization.

1048
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:23,780
Let's everyone cheer Mimosa on, Okidoki.

1049
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:28,780
Oh, I can hear the thunder.

1050
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,780
I hear the thunderbutton lightning.

1051
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:33,780
So, I'll see you guys again next time.

1052
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:37,780
And remember, scream for mercy!

1053
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,780
Bye-bye!
