1
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,320
Only 5 minutes of training left.

2
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,680
Wait a minute, I'm not sure it's empty.

3
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,380
I'll just make this video bigger.

4
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,620
Where she told me one of her friends is not allowed to be abused

5
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,120
It is.

6
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,620
Maybe, and any problem with one of them

7
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,620
orpho

8
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,120
was even more hurtful than I thought.

9
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,880
YAY!

10
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,720
å¸Œ...

11
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Hello!

12
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Welcome everyone to the swing!

13
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,720
I'm gonna just call over that one up up there.

14
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Oh that was real smooth.

15
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
That was real smooth, sorry.

16
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Oh god.

17
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Okay, so who's gonna try?

18
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm a muppet.

19
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Yeah, I place the muppet where you look like you're controlling the muppet.

20
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,720
It does look like I'm controlling the muppet, thank you.

21
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Anyway.

22
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Should we introduce ourselves?

23
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Yeah.

24
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Who goes first?

25
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Okay, oh god, okay.

26
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Hello, I am Apollo Mythos and I am underneath a mythos here with Poseidon 2.

27
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Wee, I am the goddess of the sun.

28
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Wee, yay!

29
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Pachi, pachi, pachi, pachi, pachi.

30
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I can't clap with these controllers.

31
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Oh god, well decided.

32
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Oh, is it my turn?

33
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Yeah, I was like, I'm done.

34
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
You have more to say.

35
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I mean, I don't know what to say, I'm the goddess.

36
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Oh no.

37
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Hi, my name is Poseidon and I'm very wet.

38
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I'm gonna have to agree.

39
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

40
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I went out there for just one second and came out like, oh, I'm soaking.

41
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Oh, this is how it's gonna go.

42
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
I'm excited then.

43
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Hi, my name is Sheevee Cottonbum.

44
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Hello, your Dom.

45
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,720
I was gonna come up with a Rizz line, but forget it.

46
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
But you can call me anytime.

47
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Don't tell me that.

48
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm gonna start calling you like four in the morning.

49
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
That is totally okay, I'll pick up for you.

50
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Better keep your word, I'm gonna call you.

51
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Great, I'm already being bullied by the chat.

52
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Just as planned.

53
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Oh yeah, and I stream on YouTube with Veeler, hey.

54
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Yeah.

55
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Hello, my name is Mercy Modiste.

56
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
I am the dorky yandere of Veeler's Gen 1 Indulge.

57
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Pleased to meet you.

58
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Screaming for mercy.

59
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Oh my god, do it again.

60
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Wait, are you screaming for mercy?

61
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Because I can moan for you if you want.

62
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I will never say no to that.

63
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Oh my god, that was so hot.

64
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Would you like that?

65
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Oh my god, I'm melting already.

66
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
I feel like I'm in bamboo zone.

67
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Give me a second, I need to clean up.

68
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
I need a towel.

69
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Man, I love this mix here.

70
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
I see, I see.

71
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Shimei has discovered.

72
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Oh my god, I don't know how to play this.

73
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
You guys wanna start now?

74
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Yeah, let's start, let's just lean it.

75
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Nothing like some good scuff around here.

76
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Have a good time.

77
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Thank you, Todette.

78
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Thank you for, don't tire yourself out.

79
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Do you guys have a favorite Mario character?

80
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Toad!

81
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Toad!

82
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I found a shadow.

83
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
I can't do it.

84
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Mario Party.

85
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
It's gonna be my first time playing this one.

86
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
It'll be fun, I love this version of Mario Party.

87
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
It's really fun.

88
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
It was the Seisho Apollo stream so far.

89
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Wow.

90
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
I already broke the Seisho.

91
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Why?

92
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Apolly of a Mickey impression?

93
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
That's right everybody.

94
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Give me a second, I need this.

95
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Listen here little lady.

96
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
You and I tonight.

97
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Gosh Apollo, I didn't know you were so talented.

98
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
You should listen to many.

99
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh boy.

100
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
I gave it to her real good.

101
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
I know, I was watching this.

102
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Okay.

103
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
I can be Mercy again.

104
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Oh, I'll be.

105
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Mercy all.

106
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Yay.

107
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Rosalina's my girl.

108
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Wait, no, I don't wanna be the monkey.

109
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
I have to click while I'm reading.

110
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Don't look at me like that chat.

111
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Stop it.

112
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
That's gonna be a clip.

113
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Fuck y'all.

114
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Chibi, I think you're thingy is still on.

115
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
You're like, reverb?

116
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Is it?

117
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
I turned it off.

118
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Did you guys select your character yet?

119
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Click A.

120
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
There we go.

121
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
There we go.

122
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Smart.

123
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Hi, thank you so much.

124
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Wow, little chibi.

125
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Oh, it's lagging.

126
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Oh no, shit.

127
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
The connection is unstable.

128
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Why?

129
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Who's toaster is connected?

130
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Mine's fine, I'm good.

131
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Alright, there's four maps.

132
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
So we have,

133
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
we have Yoshi's Tropical Island,

134
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Space Land,

135
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Peach's Birthday Cake.

136
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
I want the cake.

137
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
You want the cake?

138
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
You want the cake?

139
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
So there's like little Bowser's Island

140
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
and if you land there,

141
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
like basically just

142
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
ruin your game.

143
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
You guys want the birthday cake?

144
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Sure.

145
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I want cake.

146
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Give me that cake, girl.

147
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Oh yeah, it's the host, it's the host.

148
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Oh my god, it's me.

149
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
The cake by the ocean.

150
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Okay, it's recommended to do 15.

151
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
So it's so baby.

152
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
What is this lag?

153
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
I love cake.

154
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm so hungry now.

155
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I just want a cake.

156
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
I'm dying.

157
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Okay, hold up.

158
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Why the fuck are you dying?

159
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
I'm dying.

160
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
The internet down here in Atlantis is good.

161
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Oh no.

162
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
The scoff is real.

163
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
And we just started this shit.

164
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
You think with all the internet wires

165
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
underwater

166
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
that you have amazing

167
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
connection.

168
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
You're a sexy Muppet.

169
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Why are you questioning my Muppet hood?

170
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
You in the chat, shut up.

171
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Hell yeah.

172
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
I suck my Muppet.

173
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Nevermind.

174
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I can do any games.

175
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Okay.

176
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Let's go.

177
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
We're back, baby.

178
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
We're back, baby.

179
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Let's go.

180
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Put it in my ass.

181
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
What?

182
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
What do you say about your ass?

183
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Mario.

184
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
That's a good peach.

185
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Mario.

186
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Put it in my bum-bum.

187
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Oh my gosh.

188
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
What are you talking about?

189
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm so cute.

190
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
It is such an adorable map.

191
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
I love this map.

192
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Oh, it's so cute.

193
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Our very special princess.

194
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I need to take off my pants for this.

195
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
So cute.

196
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Take off your pants.

197
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
I know. I usually don't.

198
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
I don't.

199
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Oh, what are we celebrating?

200
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
My birthday.

201
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
I'm just kidding.

202
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Happy is early.

203
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
It's Friday.

204
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Happy early birthday.

205
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Happy birthday to you.

206
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Happy birthday to you.

207
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Happy birthday to you.

208
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Happy birthday to you.

209
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Happy birthday to you.

210
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Happy birthday to you.

211
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Toad is in charge.

212
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Who put Toad in charge?

213
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Toquish it.

214
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
How do you use your voice

215
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
not heard after?

216
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
I don't know.

217
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I'm pretending and I'm like,

218
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
wow, I really, I really,

219
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
really heard my voice.

220
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Okay, let's see the instructions.

221
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Oh, it's so cute.

222
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
I'm going to eat this cake out.

223
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
What?

224
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Eat me out instead.

225
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I'm just kidding.

226
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
I'm not kidding.

227
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
We weren't.

228
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
This looks so fun. I've never played this.

229
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
You don't want to end up over here, by the way.

230
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
You don't want to end up where Bowser's at.

231
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
That's some flan.

232
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
That's so cute.

233
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
I kind of want to be with Bowser.

234
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Bowser is kind of home.

235
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Physically is.

236
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Physically, emotionally.

237
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
Okay.

238
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
When I went to go watch the Mario game,

239
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
in the faders,

240
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
when Bowser came out, I was like, Daddy?

241
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Wait, everybody heard me

242
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
and I was going back.

243
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Oh, does this not use gyro control?

244
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Shit.

245
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I was going to push the air.

246
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Oh, no.

247
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
There you go.

248
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Oh, I was to pay attention.

249
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
I forgot to tweet that I'm live.

250
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Oh, God.

251
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm first.

252
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Oh, my.

253
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
That's fucking old.

254
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm just one out there.

255
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Man.

256
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I'm sorry, Mercy.

257
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
It's over.

258
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
You're last.

259
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
You're the best for last.

260
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Many games. I'm so horrible.

261
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Many games.

262
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Yay.

263
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
What is that?

264
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Yeah.

265
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Well, we know how to play Mario Party.

266
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Okay.

267
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Just stop this version.

268
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
I thought it was your first time playing Mario Party.

269
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
It is for me.

270
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Okay, it's for...

271
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah, it is for me.

272
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
I know.

273
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
I'm taking...

274
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
We're popping her Party Cherry.

275
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Party Cherry.

276
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
We're so honored to be your first.

277
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Oh my God.

278
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Oh, that's in a group.

279
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
It's beautiful ladies.

280
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Here we go.

281
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,220
OK.

282
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,720
Here we go.

283
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Oh, OK.

284
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,220
OK.

285
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
So you're going to click the dice block.

286
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,720
Oh, OK.

287
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
You can check the board if you want.

288
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,220
OK.

289
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,720
OK.

290
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
It's like whipping out the fucking wrap.

291
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Oh, so Claire's looks so good.

292
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,220
And the wafer looks so good.

293
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
This is beautiful.

294
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,720
Oh, no.

295
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I want to eat this.

296
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,220
I have some Korean pastries next to me.

297
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
And I'm going to snap.

298
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

299
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,220
She'll click the ice block.

300
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,720
There you go.

301
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
There you go.

302
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,220
OK.

303
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,720
You just roll a number.

304
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Oh my God.

305
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
You'll move two spaces.

306
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
You move two spaces to the board game.

307
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Oh my God.

308
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
I'm so proud.

309
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,220
Thank you.

310
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,720
Thank you.

311
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Yeah, it's my fucking turn.

312
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,220
OK.

313
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,720
Fuck.

314
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I am so sorry.

315
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,220
My fat ass came from behind and fuck bumps me there.

316
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
No.

317
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,720
No.

318
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,220
Let's go.

319
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,220
Dude, do you guys see that?

320
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,220
They pushed me right in.

321
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,720
Oh my gosh.

322
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,220
Thank you.

323
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,220
I'm so sorry.

324
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
Thank you.

325
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,720
That's OK.

326
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,220
I liked it.

327
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,720
I hate that it doesn't have gyro controls.

328
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,220
I'm so sorry.

329
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,720
I don't know how to set up this.

330
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Oh, damn.

331
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
What's this?

332
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,720
We're just knocking everybody out.

333
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,220
Damn.

334
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,720
I wish I had apple juice.

335
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
He's big or small.

336
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I don't know how big.

337
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
It's like a strawberry.

338
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
I love strawberries.

339
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Sure.

340
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,220
What is it?

341
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,720
I feel like this is going to be a bad thing.

342
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Oh, it is.

343
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Oh.

344
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Now that's a healthy strawberry.

345
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
I don't think that's a strawberry.

346
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Oh, no.

347
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Great.

348
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,720
When a opponent lands on the space, the strawberry will still coins.

349
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
I don't think strawberries look like that.

350
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,220
I don't think strawberries look like that.

351
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,220
Me game time.

352
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Oh.

353
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
Oh.

354
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Oh.

355
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,220
Rapid river rain.

356
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Oh, I hate this one.

357
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Huh?

358
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,220
I don't know any of the minigames.

359
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
What's this one?

360
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Oh, OK.

361
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
What's the?

362
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Is that all right?

363
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
OK.

364
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Oh, my God.

365
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
I'm ready.

366
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
I'm about to fucking.

367
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Oh.

368
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I never mind.

369
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Oh, my God.

370
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
Oh, no.

371
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
You know, we should probably start.

372
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Ah.

373
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
This is our practice.

374
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
The leg is so.

375
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
OK.

376
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
It's so bad.

377
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Sorry, guys.

378
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
I'm serious.

379
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
The connection is unstable.

380
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
We know.

381
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
We know.

382
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,220
Yeah.

383
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Sorry, it's the Atlantean Internet.

384
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,220
I can't.

385
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,220
I'll be ready.

386
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,220
It's like sabatole.

387
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
It's OK.

388
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
You know what?

389
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
It's just a little more challenging.

390
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
I think I got the gist of it, though.

391
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,220
You burst out a little plus.

392
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
Oh, that's me.

393
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
That's me.

394
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
I don't have drift on my controllers.

395
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,220
Hello.

396
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
I love you so much.

397
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
I'm screwed.

398
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Apple juice, Tom, baby.

399
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
I wish I had that right now.

400
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I'm ready.

401
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Let's go.

402
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Zooming.

403
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Oh.

404
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
It's harder than I thought it was.

405
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I know.

406
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
The controls feel so sensitive.

407
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Oh, shit.

408
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Yeah.

409
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
What the heck?

410
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
And I know I have drift on one of my controllers.

411
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,220
I feel like I can never really get the middle one.

412
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,220
No.

413
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
What?

414
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Please, please let me through.

415
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Let me in.

416
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Let me in.

417
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
Speed the flick up.

418
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
Oh my god.

419
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
I did it.

420
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Yeah.

421
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Squeeze it in.

422
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Second place.

423
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
It's to me, Marcio.

424
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Hey, if this was Mario Kart, y'all would be wiped.

425
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
I know.

426
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm so bad at it.

427
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
I'm disgusting at Mario Kart.

428
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I can't do that.

429
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
That isn't good, by the way.

430
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,220
I know the people out there that don't know what that is.

431
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Oh, no.

432
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,220
Oh.

433
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
Oh.

434
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Robbed.

435
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
I'm right here.

436
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
All right.

437
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
We got this.

438
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
High numbers.

439
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
Okay.

440
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
Never mind.

441
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,220
It was robbed.

442
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Oh my god.

443
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
No.

444
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,720
I hate you and your dumb strawberries.

445
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
All my money.

446
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
No.

447
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
What?

448
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
I couldn't give it out of mercy.

449
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
I can't believe you.

450
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
I thought you were my sister.

451
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
I am your sister.

452
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,720
What's yours is mine and what's mine is, well, mine.

453
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Oh, I can also plant a strawberry.

454
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
No.

455
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Yes.

456
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
I wonder what a large one would be.

457
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,220
I'd probably take your stars, maybe.

458
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Oh, dang.

459
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,220
Snore princess, let's go.

460
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Shut up.

461
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
There's a lot of coins.

462
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,220
Okay, okay.

463
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,220
Mario.

464
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,220
Please, please.

465
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Please land on my strawberry.

466
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
I'm begging.

467
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
That sounds funny.

468
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
No.

469
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,220
Plump, sweet and begging for cream.

470
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Are you going to plant another one?

471
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
No.

472
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,220
No.

473
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Are you kidding me?

474
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
No.

475
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm about to steal all your money.

476
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
You don't want me to pick you up, princess style.

477
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Maybe if it includes rewards.

478
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Oh.

479
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Hello, honey.

480
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
What is this?

481
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Are you destroying bills that I need to pay?

482
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Oh, no.

483
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
What is this?

484
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Oh.

485
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
All right.

486
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
This is all about timing.

487
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
It's all about timing.

488
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Oh, I see, I see.

489
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,220
Oh, do I try to hit you guys?

490
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
Oh, I see.

491
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

492
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,220
You're OK.

493
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
Oh, OK, I get it.

494
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:05,720
I get it.

495
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,220
I get it.

496
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,720
I'm really bad.

497
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,220
Oh, that's going to be hell.

498
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,220
I'm really bad at it as well.

499
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,220
Yeah, it is just timing.

500
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Oh, I'm going to be so bad at it.

501
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,220
Let me fire.

502
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,220
Oh, God.

503
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,220
Stop.

504
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,220
Well, goodbye, cruel world.

505
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,220
How long are you guys going to do the practice?

506
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Are you guys going to do the little thing?

507
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,220
I want to.

508
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
We're going to mong my mythos over here.

509
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
Yeah, I know, right?

510
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,220
What can you expect when a bunny girl in a yonder

511
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,220
and go up against gods?

512
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Nothing.

513
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
I suck at this.

514
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,220
I just want to survive.

515
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,220
I just want to survive.

516
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,720
This is not going to go well.

517
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
What?

518
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,720
No.

519
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I keep missing.

520
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Are you lying when you say you haven't played this game?

521
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
You're pretty good.

522
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
I haven't hit a single person.

523
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
I'm going to be the first one dead.

524
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
OK, I got one.

525
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
No.

526
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,220
Oh, shit.

527
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,720
Time, time, time.

528
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
No.

529
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
No.

530
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
Oh, I blocked it.

531
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
Damn.

532
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,220
Oh.

533
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
You almost got caught.

534
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Oh, oh, oh.

535
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,220
I love the two FPS.

536
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
Oh, I'm dead.

537
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,220
Wah.

538
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Wah.

539
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
Wah.

540
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,220
No.

541
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
No.

542
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
Sorry.

543
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Oh, no.

544
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Avenge me, Mercy.

545
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
This is going to be hard to learn.

546
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
You're on that diagonal.

547
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Mercy, Mercy's Apollo.

548
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Oh.

549
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Ah.

550
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Ah.

551
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Ah.

552
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Ah.

553
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Ah.

554
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,720
I've been funny or feel like I missed each other for like five minutes.

555
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Constant.

556
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Hold on, Ellen.

557
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,720
She beats volume if she's a little loud.

558
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
I'm so sorry.

559
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
It's OK.

560
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,720
It's my own adjustments, too.

561
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
How about now?

562
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Hello, hello.

563
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,220
My name is Shibi Kahnbum.

564
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,220
I'm your favorite summon day tricks bunny.

565
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Don't you want to give me a kiss?

566
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
Yes.

567
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Mmm.

568
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Ah.

569
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Don't do it.

570
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Oh, no, don't do it.

571
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
Do it.

572
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,220
No, don't do it.

573
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,220
What the hell?

574
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,220
Hello.

575
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,720
OK.

576
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
As long as she sounds good now, I'm so sorry.

577
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
That was me on my end.

578
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,720
I can't believe you've done this.

579
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
Yes.

580
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
I can't believe you've done this.

581
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Wow.

582
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
I hate my life.

583
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,720
I'm so bad at impersonation.

584
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Let's see how fast I die.

585
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Oh, thank god.

586
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Oh, I need some luck.

587
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Oh.

588
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
Damn.

589
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
Oh, snap.

590
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,220
You got your money back.

591
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,220
Let's go.

592
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
It's my turn.

593
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,220
Let's go.

594
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
I forgot you can emote in this game.

595
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Can I?

596
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,220
You can?

597
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
Yeah.

598
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
Hold on.

599
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,220
What?

600
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Oh my god.

601
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,220
I can't afford the star.

602
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
How much is it?

603
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
No.

604
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,220
It's like 30, I think.

605
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,720
No, I can't afford it.

606
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Come on.

607
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Who the heck was that voice?

608
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Eh.

609
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Oh.

610
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Oh, no.

611
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Wait, wait.

612
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Who's strawberry's that?

613
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
It's my strawberry.

614
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Oh.

615
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Oh.

616
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,720
It gave you a smile and money.

617
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Oh.

618
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,220
Oh.

619
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
Oh.

620
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
Mush pit.

621
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
Oh, it's a mosh.

622
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,220
It's a mosh.

623
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
I don't even know what a mosh pit is.

624
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
I'm going to smash all of you.

625
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
No.

626
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
Oh, no.

627
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,220
We have to run.

628
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,220
I literally like died.

629
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,220
So we go like, what?

630
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Do we jump?

631
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,220
You hit the block.

632
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Yeah.

633
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,720
Block to find the mushroom.

634
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Sorry.

635
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,720
This is going to be hard for me because I have no sense of, you know.

636
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Oh, thank you very much.

637
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
No.

638
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
I'm running.

639
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm running.

640
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
I'm running.

641
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
I'm running.

642
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
I'm running.

643
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm running.

644
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
I'm running.

645
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
I'm running.

646
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
I'm running.

647
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
I'm running.

648
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
I'm running.

649
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
I'm running.

650
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
I'm running.

651
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
I'm running.

652
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I'm running.

653
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Dang it.

654
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
It's going to take a while.

655
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
I also have terrible depth perception.

656
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
I'm running.

657
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
Oh, my God.

658
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Oh, that was a real game.

659
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,220
Oh, God.

660
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm big.

661
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,220
Wait, you can ground pound?

662
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
Nice.

663
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
That's not the only pounding I want.

664
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,220
Let's scream.

665
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Please be gentle.

666
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Oh, jump me.

667
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
Guys, why don't we start the game?

668
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
No.

669
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
I wasn't even looking and I killed you guys.

670
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
You steal.

671
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Are you kidding me?

672
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Beginner's wall.

673
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Beginner's wall.

674
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
I choked.

675
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
I'm so sorry.

676
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
I'm so sorry, hair.

677
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,220
My choked.

678
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
Oh, my God.

679
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,220
Oh.

680
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
I am at the bottom still.

681
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
How do you should be?

682
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
I'm normally atop, so this worked out.

683
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,220
I like tell my dad all the time.

684
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
I'm like, I'm a switch, guys.

685
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,220
I swear.

686
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,220
I don't know.

687
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,220
You're the bottom.

688
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,220
You shut the fuck up.

689
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
Yeah.

690
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
All right.

691
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
I'm ready.

692
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Can I get a little thingy, my barber?

693
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Can I like plant a strawberry?

694
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
I hate it here.

695
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,220
Oh, now I'm third.

696
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,220
I've been getting nothing but robbed.

697
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
Robbed of my wins.

698
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
Damn.

699
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,220
It's OK.

700
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
Oh, it's me.

701
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,220
It's me.

702
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Please.

703
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Oh, my God.

704
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,220
No.

705
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,220
Oh.

706
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Cute.

707
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
Oh.

708
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,220
Hey, yeah.

709
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,220
Lucky space.

710
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,720
Watcher just gives you a star.

711
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,220
I would like just throw my switch across the room.

712
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,720
No, don't throw it.

713
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Double the dice.

714
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Damn.

715
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
That's really good.

716
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Nice.

717
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
It's a my turn.

718
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
It's a mercial time.

719
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Fuck.

720
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,720
I knew you were going to get a one.

721
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
I felt it in my bones.

722
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Well, Shabee's rage-sick over this game.

723
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
More likely than not.

724
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Oh, great.

725
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Oh, my God.

726
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
All right.

727
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,220
Are you serious?

728
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
Well, well, well.

729
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,220
OK.

730
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
The world hates me right now.

731
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Wait, I don't know.

732
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,220
Don't never mind.

733
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,220
I don't.

734
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
I'm not ready.

735
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Oh, do I have to, like, pull it?

736
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Oh, we like.

737
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Great.

738
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
One, two.

739
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,220
One, two.

740
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
One, two.

741
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
This is OK.

742
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
Hold on.

743
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,220
We're going to have to get a very lucky.

744
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
I'm pretending this is my harem's nipples.

745
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Oh.

746
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
We're losing so badly right now.

747
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
So I'm trying to, like.

748
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
I think I'm ready.

749
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
I think we should start.

750
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,720
I'm ready.

751
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
We're not ready.

752
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Thank you.

753
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
What the hell?

754
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Why are we not rotating the note?

755
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Why are we losing?

756
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Why are we losing?

757
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
You hear that?

758
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
Yeah.

759
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,220
How do you know how to rotate this damn thing?

760
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
Yes.

761
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
I'm rotating.

762
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
I'm rotating past.

763
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,220
Oh, no.

764
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,220
I took it off.

765
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
All right.

766
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
I'll let you guys win so we can start.

767
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

768
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Wait, we're doing it.

769
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
We're doing it.

770
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,220
We're doing it.

771
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,220
Let's go.

772
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,220
She's not touching it.

773
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,220
I'm not touching the sticks.

774
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,220
I'm not touching it either.

775
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
Am I the problem?

776
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,220
Oh, wait.

777
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
I'm the problem.

778
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Holy shit.

779
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
We're so screwed.

780
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
We're so screwed.

781
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Oh, my gosh.

782
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Oh, my gosh.

783
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
This is going to be the rest of the stream.

784
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Okay.

785
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Sorry.

786
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
I need this.

787
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Give this to me.

788
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Why are you in a Bowser costume?

789
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Because I'm strong.

790
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,220
Oh, my gosh.

791
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
We got a rage.

792
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
Oh, hi.

793
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
Hello, Reflings.

794
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
Hello, Reflings.

795
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Hello, Reflings.

796
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
I'm still at the bus.

797
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Cece, you know, keep in mind that's how I'll play with your fucking nipples chat.

798
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Don't look at me.

799
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Go get it twisted.

800
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
Somebody in my cat.

801
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,720
She just said we lost to a furry.

802
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
I'm not a furry.

803
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
We love furries.

804
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Get in the furries.

805
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,720
I mean, you've got your tails and stuff.

806
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Please, I'll do our best Scottish accent.

807
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Shit.

808
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Nobody goes.

809
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Oh, shit.

810
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Oh, shit.

811
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
I had the chance to change your face.

812
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Oh, shit.

813
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Oh, shit.

814
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Oh, shit.

815
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
I had the chance to change your face.

816
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Would you?

817
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Yes.

818
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Play.

819
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,220
I just love the fondle of bosom.

820
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
Oh, my gosh.

821
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,220
Oh, shit.

822
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,220
Oh, wait.

823
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
It's when you...

824
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
I was 30 for some reason.

825
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Oh, thank you very much.

826
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,720
I'll be taking that yonk.

827
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Yonk?

828
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
I love it.

829
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,720
I'll be taking that yonk.

830
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Yonk?

831
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
I think Rosalina...

832
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
What the hell?

833
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
No, she didn't speak.

834
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Yeah, it sounded like a little more mature.

835
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
It's like...

836
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
It's mine.

837
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,220
It's mine.

838
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,220
Bye, mom.

839
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Let's go.

840
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,220
Wait, I need 22.

841
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,220
Yeah, you thought I was losing?

842
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,220
You guys don't know how competitive I am, chat.

843
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
I'll probably sit my drink.

844
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
No, I do not.

845
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,220
I do not have that sun draft.

846
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
I'm a beacheress.

847
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,220
I literally threatened my community

848
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,220
if I was beating them up.

849
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
If you ever need help doming,

850
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,220
I have a leash.

851
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,220
I have a whip.

852
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
Oh, my God, let's double team them.

853
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
A whip?

854
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
Literally, I have the same thing.

855
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,220
I got me a little mini paddle for them.

856
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
I'm already at the bottom.

857
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
A mini paddle.

858
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,220
I got a mini paddle.

859
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
I like swimming.

860
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,220
10 coins?

861
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Choose a seed?

862
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Which seed do you choose?

863
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
Who's seed will you swallow?

864
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
Who's seed will you swallow?

865
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,220
What is it?

866
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,220
No!

867
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,220
Wait, no, I'm okay with it. Daddy Bowser.

868
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,220
The mini paddle hurts more than the big paddle.

869
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,220
I'm making sure you get pain.

870
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
I thought you played this before.

871
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,220
Come on.

872
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,220
Bring it.

873
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,220
Okay, baby.

874
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,220
Yeah, dodged all of those.

875
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,220
Write that down.

876
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,220
Write that down.

877
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,220
You have a chance.

878
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,220
Oh.

879
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,220
Where are you?

880
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,220
It's your people.

881
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,220
What the frick?

882
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,220
Wait, what?

883
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,220
Okay, let's see.

884
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,220
Bee?

885
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
What the fuck are you doing?

886
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
Oh, we speed up the flower.

887
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,220
Okay.

888
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
We speed it up until they chase you.

889
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,220
So we need to do it?

890
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,220
We need to have timing.

891
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,220
No!

892
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,220
Yeah, and then we all go one at a time.

893
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
Okay, I get it.

894
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Oh, my God, Tretch.

895
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Alright.

896
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,220
Okay, I think I get it.

897
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,220
She was a skater, girl.

898
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,220
She said to you later, girl.

899
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

900
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

901
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
Yeah.

902
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,220
Alright.

903
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,220
Yeah.

904
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
As long as we're in different timings,

905
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
we can make her run.

906
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
Run, girlie.

907
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
Run!

908
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
Alright, I get the timing right.

909
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,220
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

910
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

911
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

912
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,220
Bear me.

913
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,220
Bear me, bear me, bear me.

914
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,220
Spider.

915
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
I'm Spider.

916
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
Oh, what?

917
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,220
Now it's faster than us.

918
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,220
I can't.

919
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,220
Come on, we're so close.

920
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,220
How long is this thing?

921
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,220
She's gonna make it.

922
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,220
You're probably gonna win.

923
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,220
Oh, my God.

924
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,220
Oh, shit.

925
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,220
Good job.

926
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220
I was so focused, I was like...

927
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,220
Mythos are gamers.

928
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,220
Let's go!

929
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,220
Nice.

930
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,220
I have enough to afford a star now.

931
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Woo!

932
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
I'm no longer broke.

933
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,220
No.

934
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Oh, no.

935
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,220
This is a game, definitely.

936
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
I want one.

937
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,220
I was hoping she would accidentally say no thanks.

938
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
She was like, oh, I haven't played.

939
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
I don't need this, right?

940
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,220
I actually don't know if I need it.

941
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,220
I just wanted to.

942
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
You do need the stars.

943
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,220
You do need the stars.

944
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
The stars is what makes you win.

945
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Yay.

946
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,220
There's just one coin ahead of me.

947
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,220
A bench space.

948
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Wait, that's cheating!

949
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,220
What?

950
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,220
Wait, what do you mean that's cheating?

951
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,220
Wait, wait a second.

952
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
How far away is that?

953
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,220
I didn't mean to...

954
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,220
I want to look at the board.

955
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,220
You don't know what I'm doing.

956
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,220
I'm just a little chicken.

957
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Oh, yeah.

958
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,220
I already know.

959
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,220
Daddy is going to be robbing me.

960
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,220
I think you're good.

961
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
Oh, no, I think I'm going for another turn.

962
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
It's fine.

963
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,220
You made it.

964
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,220
It's a my turn!

965
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,220
That's a goal!

966
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,220
Motherfucker!

967
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,220
Damn.

968
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,220
I'm going to use coins.

969
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,220
Yes!

970
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,220
Oh, no.

971
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,220
A few.

972
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,220
No world.

973
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,220
World me, baby.

974
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,220
You spin me.

975
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,220
Oh, what is this?

976
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,220
This is wine!

977
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,220
I'm so excited.

978
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,220
I already won.

979
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,220
Wait, what is this one?

980
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,220
Okay, I think I did it.

981
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,220
Oh, damn!

982
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,220
She got it.

983
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,220
Why is everyone so gamers?

984
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,220
My thumb hurt.

985
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
Oh, what?

986
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,220
I know exactly what she's doing.

987
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,220
What am I doing?

988
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,220
I'm not going to say.

989
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,220
You're ready!

990
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,220
What?

991
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,220
Okay, I'm ready.

992
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,220
I'm ready, let's go.

993
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,220
Oh, God, I'm going to lose.

994
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,220
I need to hold my switch in a different way.

995
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,220
Oh, damn!

996
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
I think I figured it out.

997
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,220
No!

998
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,220
I couldn't button mash.

999
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,220
No!

1000
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,220
Oh, no!

1001
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,220
My hand cramped up.

1002
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,220
No!

1003
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
Man, I wish I had a 30-60.

1004
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,220
Oh, my!

1005
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
It's okay, it's fine.

1006
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Everything is okay.

1007
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,220
My finger action is just that good, baby.

1008
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,220
Damn!

1009
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,220
Dang girl, you're good with your fingers?

1010
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,220
Yeah, I'll show you later.

1011
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Thank you so much.

1012
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,220
Thank you, thank you.

1013
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,220
Oh, God.

1014
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,220
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm coming for that peachy booty.

1015
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,220
Don't you worry.

1016
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,220
Damn!

1017
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,220
Oh, thank you.

1018
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,220
Yay!

1019
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,220
I'm getting my ass handed to me.

1020
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,220
Are you okay?

1021
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,220
At least you're not on the bottom.

1022
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
I hit it, block!

1023
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,220
It's okay, as long as I talk to you.

1024
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,220
I hit it, block!

1025
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,220
Wait, what?

1026
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,220
Okay, oh, yay.

1027
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,220
Uh, it's so annoying.

1028
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,220
Pat the game?

1029
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,220
I don't know how to do that.

1030
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,220
I'm not that smart.

1031
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,220
How is she winning?

1032
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,220
I'm flying!

1033
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,220
I really, this is my first time.

1034
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,220
I swear, please.

1035
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
Thanks.

1036
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,220
I say the same thing every single time in bed.

1037
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,220
It's my first time.

1038
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,220
Oh, my God.

1039
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,220
No!

1040
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,220
You're robbed!

1041
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,220
Why does Mercy just keep robbing you?

1042
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,220
Mercy!

1043
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,220
I love your money!

1044
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,220
Thank you!

1045
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,220
Oh, my God.

1046
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,220
I'm gonna cry.

1047
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,220
I should wait for the warp block.

1048
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,220
Oh, my God.

1049
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,220
It's, I swear, I never done it before.

1050
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,220
You gotta believe me.

1051
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,220
Why does that sound like a lie?

1052
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,220
But it's not a lie.

1053
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,220
I don't know.

1054
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,220
I swear, I'm not lying.

1055
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,220
I feel sorry for you, almost.

1056
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,220
He starts pounding you.

1057
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,220
Baby!

1058
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,220
He just blows your bag out.

1059
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,220
I feel like I'm gonna take a few coins.

1060
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,220
Wait, he just gave me money!

1061
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,220
Money!

1062
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,220
That was really nice of you.

1063
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,220
I want to take his load.

1064
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,220
You gotta wait in line like the rest of us, God!

1065
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,220
Damn!

1066
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,220
There's a huge of lies.

1067
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,220
Guys, I need art of all of us in Bowser's stat.

1068
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,220
Thank you, chat. Appreciate it.

1069
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,220
Thank you.

1070
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,220
Although, Mercy is very innocent.

1071
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,220
She can be in, like, the chair off to the stud.

1072
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,220
She's the one who wants to participate.

1073
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,220
She's just observing.

1074
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,220
Yeah, she's learning.

1075
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,220
She's rude.

1076
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,220
The cooner.

1077
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
Okay, fine. She's front and center.

1078
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,220
Yeah!

1079
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,220
Mercy gonna be watching with that camera.

1080
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,220
She's taking it like a champ.

1081
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,220
I want to buy.

1082
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,220
Also in the chair.

1083
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,220
What's a warpline?

1084
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,220
Hello, thank you so much for following, honey.

1085
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,220
I'm gonna teleport you to somebody else's.

1086
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,220
Oh.

1087
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,220
I'll take Double Dice.

1088
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,220
Imagine if it's two ones.

1089
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,220
If it's two ones, I will cry.

1090
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,220
I am committing in Minecraft.

1091
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,220
Committing?

1092
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,220
Yeah, I say committing.

1093
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,220
Suicide all.

1094
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,220
Oh, no.

1095
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,220
Oh, no!

1096
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,220
No.

1097
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,220
Not the water.

1098
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,220
What's this one?

1099
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,220
Are you playing golf?

1100
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,220
Golf?

1101
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,220
What?

1102
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,220
Oh, this is golf.

1103
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,220
Oh, okay.

1104
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,220
I love golf, sort of.

1105
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,220
Nice.

1106
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,220
Nice shot.

1107
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,220
Oh, okay.

1108
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,220
Thank you.

1109
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,220
Cock.

1110
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,220
I'm a natural.

1111
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,220
Natural having cock?

1112
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,220
Yes.

1113
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,220
Oh, because she's a pollo.

1114
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,220
I'm struggling because the connection is unstable.

1115
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,220
Oh, no.

1116
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,220
It's fine.

1117
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,220
It's fine.

1118
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,220
I did not see that.

1119
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,220
I was lagging so bad.

1120
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,220
Oh, so that's how you do.

1121
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,220
Oh, my God.

1122
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,220
Oh, my God.

1123
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,220
Are you kidding me?

1124
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,220
Oh, my God.

1125
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,220
Hold on one, baby.

1126
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,220
The slow motion.

1127
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,220
Slowly cross up.

1128
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:26,840
Yeah. Fuck. Oh no! I can't even fucking calculate it. Can I have another practice?

1129
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:41,640
I'm so sorry. Oh, and it changes each time. Oh, I get to go first. Joy. Let's see if I'll

1130
00:49:41,640 --> 00:50:07,440
still get lag. You got it! I believe in you! Oh. How about the edge of glory? Is there wind

1131
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:15,880
speed? Should I be accounting for wind? How do we do the power thing? Oh. The power? Oh,

1132
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,920
you move your joy card up and down as opposed to left and right. Yeah, your little ring.

1133
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:34,000
The power. Oh, the wind was there. That was the wind. The wind took it. I didn't realize!

1134
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,680
There has to be wind because the flag moves. Oh wait, no, it's just lagging.

1135
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:51,360
It's the lag. It's the lag. Amazing. Oh God. Please. She's gonna blast it off because of the lag.

1136
00:50:51,360 --> 00:51:07,640
Damn. Oh. Oh. I'm in hell. I'm ready. I don't get it still. Give me one second. Okay. Give me one second.

1137
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:20,760
Give me one! The connection is unstable. The connection is unstable. I'm mentally unstable. How

1138
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:34,940
about that? Okay, I think I'm ready. If this is fine, this is I'm ready. I understand. I'm eating

1139
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:48,740
bueno. Candy boys. Hopefully it just lags in the practice. Sorry. What are you eating?

1140
00:51:48,740 --> 00:52:10,700
A bueno. A bueno? A bueno. I want one. Yes. I go first. Okay, sorry. Oh, sorry. I missed

1141
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,660
this tip. Someone said, thank you for the $1 tip anonymous. Like Poseidon and Icy would be good

1142
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:25,740
friends. Icy has her OG fans Poseidon has her daddy. Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, my God.

1143
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:35,540
All in one. Did you get that with lag? I'm cooked. I don't have a chance. I'm done. I'm not even gonna try.

1144
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:52,780
Oh, damn. That's pretty close. I'm such a gamer. I blame the lag, bro. I haven't played yet. I'm sorry.

1145
00:52:53,100 --> 00:53:06,020
I am my turn. It's a lag. Sorry. I don't know who to find out. It might be the eels that live next door.

1146
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:27,180
The lag is real. Oh, I'm in pain. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Call me Tiger Woods, the way I'm about to chop down this

1147
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:39,100
truth. That doesn't make any sense. I didn't get it, but you had the spirit. I was trying. I was trying really hard. I

1148
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:49,780
need to get a cookie. I'll be right back. A cookie. Yeah, I'm hungry. I just had Korean black noodles. No, so what

1149
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:59,180
am I meant to do? Are you kidding me? Yeah, you can have some. Please don't be. I hate this game. Why did you pick it?

1150
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:10,060
I didn't pick anything. I got to talk a little earlier. I did, but I get hungry. I just get hungry. I love you.

1151
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:29,660
Food is my personality. I love the lag. We love lag in this house. This is the best part.

1152
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:45,260
Slow-mo disappearing. Kind of like dramatic. I'm charging up my final attack. Wow, that's just like a whole 30

1153
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:56,300
seconds. Oh, I'm fainting. I'm so dramatic. Where's my mouth open? A fly is going to fly in. And other things. Has

1154
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:08,700
that happened before? Yeah. I had my mouth open and I was like, I'm concerned. I can't tell what's

1155
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:18,740
happening. I can't either. Everybody's just on the floor except for me. This is just the Mario Party

1156
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:31,500
experience. I'm just kidding. No, it's not. I have so many coins. You have so much money now. I do. Here we go. I'm

1157
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:48,700
going to freaking lose it. I swear to God. Is this my money? No. Are you serious? Don't do it. Don't do it. Dang it.

1158
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,220
Let's drop her. Who's gone now?

1159
00:55:53,820 --> 00:56:04,140
But, but, but, oh wait. Oh, no. Paul is back. I'm sure. I'm here. I'm here. My life is over. I was going to do a big one, but I was like,

1160
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,700
nah.

1161
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:17,820
Me too.

1162
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:26,460
Shit. Wait. Wait, you got the lucky one. It's fine. Actually, I'll type that back.

1163
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:56,060
What is that do? Oh, that's not lucky. That's not lucky. It's not. Well, no, it could be used. Let's say I'm like, I'm like right close to the star or like close to something. Now you get by it. Yeah, I'm unlucky.

1164
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:09,420
First, just like me. I'm first. Oh, snap. Oh, snap. I have my sword. I feel powerful.

1165
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,940
I thought it was going to lag and you accidentally were going to click no.

1166
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,940
It like just froze for me for like a split second. Oh, no.

1167
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:34,060
All right. This noise is all yours. Take it and shove it up your butt. Did you say the butt? The butt. Up my butt.

1168
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,900
Yeah, that's a good one.

1169
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:44,860
It's a mine turn. Let's go. God, fucking damn it. Wait, nah, that's good.

1170
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:59,180
Oh, I'm like, I'm like, go, but just fucking stare at you. Yeah, okay. Oh, fuck. Oh, this will determine your fate.

1171
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:05,980
Okay, I want to choose someone's seed, right? If you have the chance to pick your seed, would you?

1172
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,140
I can literally hear it coming out of that.

1173
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,780
I'll take the long seed. No, no.

1174
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,780
Oh, no.

1175
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:32,940
Wait, did she connect back? It's like no. Where is he? You die. How did I die?

1176
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:42,460
Wait, what? We can pause the game. Wait, did I just disconnect? No, no, no. I paused the game. Oh, okay.

1177
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:50,620
I think from what, because it's happened last time I played this, if we leave it, it'll save the progress.

1178
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:57,740
Okay. We just have to wait for her to get back. All right, sounds good. If not, yeah.

1179
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:07,500
You can continue playing. Go to square. Oh, no. Mercy, come back. I'm still here. What?

1180
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:17,740
It's almost like I can hear her. Wait, what? Guys, can you guys hear her? Mercy, oh, mercy.

1181
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:29,180
Did I disconnect? He disconnected from the game. Yes, but I'm still playing on my side.

1182
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:39,660
What? You are? Yeah. We all like left the game. Yeah, but I'm still playing.

1183
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:50,460
Oh, no. Let me go. But are you actively playing or are you?

1184
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,900
We're on the mini game. We're on the mini game. I hope I win.

1185
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:04,700
Tell me if I win. I'm just watching Mercy scream. How do I disconnect?

1186
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,340
I'm watching us play balloon burst.

1187
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,740
The two NPCs are winning. Let's go. Come on. Let's go, Poseidon.

1188
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:33,100
Oh, oh, we won. Okay, we're back on turn eight.

1189
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:39,660
This is your turn, Peach. Oh, okay. Let's see. Wait, how do we get out of here? But she's locked.

1190
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,380
She's locked.

1191
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:59,180
Mercy, if you can click the plush button, maybe, maybe, it's a star. It's one and a half.

1192
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:04,700
Do I have to, like, quit out of it?

1193
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,860
I think so. Oh, my God. I've never had your specific situation happen before.

1194
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:17,660
Disconnected so badly. Anyways, I'm still playing the game. I want to win against the NPCs. Sorry.

1195
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,820
Oh, sweet. I land on it again. Oh, damn. Get the fuck out of my way.

1196
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:35,260
Please don't let me get a dice block. Oh, let's go.

1197
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:44,300
Maybe I should, like, quit the game and join Mckin. Yeah. Can she? Perclapse.

1198
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:50,860
Let me quit the game on my end. Okay. See if that'll do any.

1199
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:57,820
It's black screen because I'm making sure that you, that, that some pies and snippets

1200
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:03,740
and other people don't see what's going on if I accidentally dox myself or something. It's a safety

1201
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:13,180
reason. Oh, I wonder if you, it says here, if you want to play the game with someone else,

1202
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:17,740
press B to end your current session. But if we end the current session. We gotta start all over.

1203
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,300
We might have to start over.

1204
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:28,700
Is there less turns than 15? I'm sorry for somehow disconnecting.

1205
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:34,540
It's okay. It's not your fault. It happens. It happens. It happens.

1206
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,020
So, uh, how about them Dodgers, am I right?

1207
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:49,740
Give me a second as I enter back in. I was like, what do you mean? It says I'm still going.

1208
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,100
I'm still going. Okay, let me know. You see they had a fish girl up there.

1209
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:04,220
She gave me a second. Yeah, I was like this weird ass fish girl and she was,

1210
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,220
she was singing stuff. Is that like a kid's cartoon or something? Do I need to go back into

1211
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:17,740
the ID that you guys gave me? The Megatron. The Megatron. Oh, flavor cake. Decepticons.

1212
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:26,380
There's leches. That's my favorite cake. Oh, I love tres leches. Yeah. Okay. I was eating

1213
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:31,980
air in the area, but I can't. There's no rooms available. So yeah, I love that. Oh, do I have

1214
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:39,420
to re-invite you? Maybe. I wonder if there's a way I can re-invite. Some kind of Annie moves.

1215
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,700
Megatron, Megatron wasn't the transformers were there.

1216
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,540
Yeah, you better write that shit down. You might have to start over. I'm so sorry.

1217
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:59,260
Can we do, can we do less turns? I think we can. Let me, let me actually. I don't have a life,

1218
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:04,460
so we can do this all day, but I don't know about you guys. It's okay. I can do it all day.

1219
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,700
I didn't have to go in like two hours, but we should be able to finish like one or two games in

1220
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:18,620
two hours. Yeah. Yeah. So we're good. We're good. I'm so sorry. I was like, what the heck? It's okay.

1221
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:32,540
Hey, does this work? No, it doesn't work. I don't know if it works. Please pick me up. I'm scared.

1222
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:41,420
I don't, I don't have my microphone monitor in. I can't tell what that sounded like.

1223
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:47,580
Well, I'm going to send advice right now. Yeah.

1224
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,020
I apologize once again for my, no, no, you're okay.

1225
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,620
Jason.

1226
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,460
Shibamus Prime.

1227
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:16,380
There comes a, no, I cannot do optimism. Not a man. Skimity, not skimity, skimity, toilet.

1228
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:22,700
What does that mean? I don't know what skimity means. I don't know either. I just accept it.

1229
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:26,780
People call me shibbity, toilet. Shibbity, toilet. Shibbity, toilet.

1230
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:33,260
I'm gonna ban them tax and shibbity your toilet and riz. Yeah.

1231
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:42,300
I'm not even paying attention. Sorry about that. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm not looking at my screen.

1232
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:47,100
I'm looking at the beautiful girls. Am I sins?

1233
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:57,740
Hi there. How are you? I'm doing good. How are you? I shitted.

1234
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,300
I have no idea how to respond.

1235
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:16,140
Okay, we're ready. I'm in. I was just reading what Toadette was saying.

1236
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:23,740
What did you say? Because Toadette was saying, hi, welcome in. How are you doing today? When

1237
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:36,300
do you like enter the game? Uh huh. I shitted. I'm shitting and farting so hard and throwing up.

1238
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:45,580
I threw up. I threw up. I had a good time. Yummy. Don't tire yourself out. Thanks, Toadette.

1239
01:06:53,740 --> 01:07:03,180
Huh? Okay, we're in. We're going down that hole.

1240
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:09,980
Who's hole? You're hole. Prepare your ass. Okay.

1241
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,500
We're at my strap. You know, I always stay strapped.

1242
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,900
Um, you guys do want to do any extracurricular activities?

1243
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:30,460
Hell yeah, brother. I shall reward myself with another cookie.

1244
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:40,300
Okay, cookies. Yay, okay, we're back here again. We're back, baby. Yes, who's back? We didn't have

1245
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,860
to ruin everything. I didn't ruin everything. Again, again.

1246
01:07:46,060 --> 01:08:02,220
Ten. Oh, oh. Oh, dang. Is this the same thing again? Yes. Damn. No. I can catch up.

1247
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:08,540
Are you serious? The other two times they landed on the lucky space. This time you're like, no,

1248
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,740
wrong. I'm so sorry. I hate it here.

1249
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:21,100
I'm about to come in. The comeback starts now. I'm about to come on your back.

1250
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:27,100
Oh, really? I'll make it happen somehow.

1251
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:34,460
Where there's a wheel, there's a way. Mercy needs punishment. Mercy needs correction after the stream.

1252
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:41,420
What? I need correction? Correction? For all your, uh, for all your little fucking strawberries.

1253
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:48,700
That wasn't my strawberry this time. Oh, well, then you all get correction.

1254
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,980
Plop, plop, plop, get corrected, get corrected.

1255
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:03,020
That wasn't my strawberry this time. It doesn't matter. You're still getting, you're still getting.

1256
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,660
I feel powerful.

1257
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:17,580
Let's go. Once again. This is the comeback. Oh, yeah. Why is it getting hot in here? I don't know,

1258
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:21,180
baby. Okay, now you can take my seed.

1259
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:28,460
My money. My money. My seed.

1260
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:38,300
You have a 25% chance of not the little one, the little one. I have a feeling.

1261
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,420
I don't know. I kind of like this. This one is, it's, it's, it's, I like the fourth one.

1262
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,740
Shiny. Actually, this one's nice too. It's cheap. Like a pumpkin.

1263
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:55,340
Wait, if it's good, I'm going to be mad. But if it's bad, I'm going to be, oh.

1264
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:02,460
It hurts from the day. You win it. Ha ha. Get corrected.

1265
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:06,540
No.

1266
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,940
Well, no, he's fourth. No, I have 14.

1267
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:28,780
Oh, if you had the coins, then, because I think, I think Bowser's nice to you when you're in fourth.

1268
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:36,060
Oh, nice. He gave you something at least. Yeah, he didn't like, wink anything from you.

1269
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:43,260
Oh, he's going to all my coins. It's an ancient artifact. Scared.

1270
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,100
I'm sorry. I encouraged that.

1271
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:56,700
I was in last place already. I was like, I'm sorry. I liked it too. I suggested it.

1272
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:07,980
Okay, what's this? Like that. Oh, I'm rocking my horse. Oh, you had to click L and R, like,

1273
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,420
to like, in tandem with the spear. Like this?

1274
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,580
You can't speed up too much.

1275
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,260
I'm so bad at this one. What?

1276
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:33,100
Oh, wait. Am I supposed to leave? What's wrong with the coins? Oh, you're supposed to.

1277
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:38,060
Oh, you're supposed to stop. Kind of pace yourself, right? Yeah.

1278
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:43,100
This is weird. I don't know how you avoid those little signs, though.

1279
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:48,140
I think you wait for it to be a strawberry. But I hit it when it was a strawberry.

1280
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:52,220
Isn't it a carrot? Oh, you hit it when it turned into a carrot is what.

1281
01:11:53,020 --> 01:12:01,820
Oh, yep. Is my rhythm on? Oh, when I hit it.

1282
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:08,540
Oh, yes. I look like I'm just stimming.

1283
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,580
This is just a stim session. I like it.

1284
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:17,500
I'm going to try to learn how this works. Give me a second.

1285
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:26,140
I'm rocking my horse. How am I in last place? Am I having to, like, go really?

1286
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:29,500
I remember the first time my daddy got my first horse.

1287
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,540
Yeah, don't hit it when it's blue.

1288
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:42,060
I hate starting to cramp up. I know what I'm saying. My fingers hurt.

1289
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,620
I don't really get it, but okay.

1290
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:50,860
Damn, you Mario Party 3. I don't really get it, but okay.

1291
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,540
It's okay. I might be dumb, but, you know.

1292
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,540
No. Fuck. No.

1293
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,740
It's been out a little bit.

1294
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,260
I really do not believe this is the first time you've-

1295
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:14,380
It really is. It's a gamer. I'm sorry.

1296
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:19,260
It really is a gamer. I'm really, I'm really truthfully honest.

1297
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:23,340
This is my first time. I get really excited about games. I just, I don't know.

1298
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:28,300
She's just not that gamer girl. Do you guys want to play the actual one?

1299
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,020
Okay, I don't know how to play this. Okay.

1300
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,580
Don't want to exhaust your carrots.

1301
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:42,060
I am not a gamer, probably.

1302
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:46,060
I'm the god of horses, yet I can't do a good horse impression.

1303
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:56,540
Okay.

1304
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,540
What the heck?

1305
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,940
Why am I stuck? I'm pressing the buttons.

1306
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,540
What the hell? Why am I stuck?

1307
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:28,540
This is unfair! This is shit!

1308
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,540
What the heck?

1309
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,540
Oh no!

1310
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:33,820
Why am I stuck?

1311
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:36,700
Damn it.

1312
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,580
Fuck!

1313
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,020
I was on Apollo's ass.

1314
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:45,500
Oh no!

1315
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,500
Mercy!

1316
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,500
I don't know why!

1317
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,500
Oh no.

1318
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,500
How the heck?

1319
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:03,500
I'm so far behind. What the hell? Like, I was like, why is some of the buttons working?

1320
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,500
Oh no!

1321
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,500
I was trying to go in a rhythm. I was like one, two, one, two.

1322
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:15,500
I wasn't happening to do that, but I have no sense of rhythm.

1323
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:19,500
I just didn't want to go.

1324
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,500
Oh damn, you have saved me.

1325
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,500
I'm so far.

1326
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:31,500
I have the worst luck, Senpai.

1327
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,500
Like, actually the worst luck ever.

1328
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,500
Your turn, Waluigi.

1329
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,980
Please.

1330
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,980
Please.

1331
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:47,980
No, I wanted one of those things.

1332
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,980
I want a strawberry.

1333
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,980
What?

1334
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,980
That was a hiccup, sorry.

1335
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,980
Oh wait, do I go down the slide?

1336
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,980
No, I don't!

1337
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,980
I wanted to go down the slide.

1338
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:05,980
The cost of your next star is cut in half.

1339
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
That sounds so good.

1340
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,980
That sounds so good.

1341
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,980
Only I had money!

1342
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:17,980
You got three coins? You're getting up there in the world.

1343
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,980
Let me out of here.

1344
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,980
Oh no!

1345
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,980
Why are you zooming?

1346
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,980
You don't have a dove!

1347
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,980
She was sprinting.

1348
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,980
No!

1349
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,980
Oh no.

1350
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,980
I didn't!

1351
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,980
It's time.

1352
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,980
Later, skater.

1353
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:47,980
Let's get ready to rumble!

1354
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,980
What is this?

1355
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,980
Hold A to move forward.

1356
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,980
What?

1357
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,980
Oh, are we...

1358
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:57,980
Oh my god, they hate me.

1359
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,980
I used to do ice skating too.

1360
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,980
What the hell?

1361
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,980
Okay, I kind of get it.

1362
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,980
I like skating.

1363
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,980
Sort of.

1364
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,980
There's a skater boy.

1365
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,980
I got the gist.

1366
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,980
I think I understand.

1367
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,980
This was not...

1368
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,980
Look at Apollo fucking zooming around.

1369
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:22,980
Do you see that?

1370
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,980
My controller is not working?

1371
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,980
I have a strat.

1372
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,980
Oh no!

1373
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,980
Is your controller not working?

1374
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,980
Mine just stopped.

1375
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:43,980
Mine just stopped all of a sudden.

1376
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,980
I think it's just being weird.

1377
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,980
No, I think it's because you finished the five laps.

1378
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,980
I didn't finish the five laps.

1379
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,980
I just went around like twice.

1380
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,980
Strat. Strat. Strat.

1381
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,980
Up the inside.

1382
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,980
Up the inside.

1383
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,980
It's not working.

1384
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,980
Is that the strat in real ice skating?

1385
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,980
Yeah, 100%.

1386
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,980
You just kick off one foot profusely.

1387
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,980
Alright, that strat's not working.

1388
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,980
Focus, focus, focus.

1389
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,980
Yes!

1390
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,980
Yes!

1391
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,980
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1392
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,980
My strat didn't work, guys.

1393
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,980
We did our best.

1394
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,980
Fuck, I'm still in last.

1395
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,980
But you're almost there.

1396
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,980
You're almost ready to buy a star.

1397
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,980
Wow, Apollo literally needs to roll.

1398
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,980
I'm sorry.

1399
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:59,980
I'm sorry.

1400
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,980
You just somehow roll a zero.

1401
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,980
Do I need it?

1402
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,980
Cannibal.

1403
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,980
Madam is simply an innovator.

1404
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:16,980
I'll just have it.

1405
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,980
Thank you, Harley.

1406
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,980
Yay!

1407
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:28,980
Silence is deafening.

1408
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:33,980
You're all just quietly seething.

1409
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,980
I'm so sorry.

1410
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,980
I'm locked in.

1411
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,980
I don't know what I'm doing.

1412
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,980
I don't know what I'm doing.

1413
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,980
Was the triple-dice always there?

1414
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,980
Yeah, I have triple-dice.

1415
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,980
What's the mushroom?

1416
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,980
I don't know what the mushroom does.

1417
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,980
I think one of the people stomps them.

1418
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,980
Or does it make you go faster?

1419
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,980
This is only the beginning.

1420
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,980
Hopefully I can start stealing.

1421
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,980
No!

1422
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,980
I want to steal.

1423
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,980
I want to commit crimes.

1424
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,980
I want to...

1425
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,980
You have 40 coins!

1426
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,980
You have 40 coins!

1427
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,980
I'm sorry!

1428
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,980
I swear.

1429
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,980
I never got the item because it never saved.

1430
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,980
Damn it.

1431
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,980
Damn, it's a killer out here.

1432
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:45,980
Are you making freaking cheese meat?

1433
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,980
At least you get a star!

1434
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:49,980
That's true.

1435
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,980
I think that's a granted.

1436
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,980
I do have enough money.

1437
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,980
Hi honey.

1438
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,980
Hi honey.

1439
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,980
Stop!

1440
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:02,980
I can't...

1441
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,980
Can you do it again?

1442
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:06,980
We're like...

1443
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:08,980
Good...

1444
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,980
Good girl, good boy.

1445
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,980
Praise is like my weakness.

1446
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:17,980
Oh, you're such a good girl.

1447
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,980
Nice.

1448
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,980
Oh god, I'm wet.

1449
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,980
Do you ever have to wash your hair?

1450
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,980
Yeah, every now and then.

1451
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,980
How does that work?

1452
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:38,980
Do you skim it?

1453
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:42,980
Does it jump into a pool and come back out fresh?

1454
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:45,980
You got to get the pH balance right.

1455
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:48,980
Just as carefully as you're coochie.

1456
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,980
Son of a bitch!

1457
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:55,980
If you didn't know, Chatters,

1458
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,980
vaginas are acidic and they have their special pH balance.

1459
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,980
Come on, you know.

1460
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,980
Son of a bitch!

1461
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,980
Wait, now Mercy, this is karma?

1462
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,980
What you did to Sheepie?

1463
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:12,980
She said it.

1464
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,980
This is karma.

1465
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:16,980
I've been taking elses the entire time!

1466
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,980
Let me have one steel!

1467
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,980
What is this?

1468
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,980
Oh, it's this one.

1469
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:27,980
Whoever's in the front steers and the other one flaps the wings.

1470
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,980
Okay, then flap the wings.

1471
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,980
Sorry, I thought I was in the front.

1472
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:34,980
I'm flapping the wings.

1473
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,980
I'm trying to steer it so hard.

1474
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:42,980
Girlie Pop, I don't know if we're winning this one.

1475
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,980
It's okay, I'm sorry.

1476
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:47,980
My wing flaps are bad.

1477
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,980
Oh, what the heck?

1478
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:52,980
I didn't look so much farther away than it actually did.

1479
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,980
Start flapping your ears.

1480
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,980
Maybe we'll start flapping.

1481
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,980
Okay, I think I get it, sort of.

1482
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,980
I'm being shot at.

1483
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:19,980
They're cheating.

1484
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,980
What do you mean we're cheating?

1485
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:23,980
They have hacks, bro.

1486
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:25,980
They have hacks, that's all I'm gonna say.

1487
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:27,980
Hey, hey, hey, don't be a sore loser.

1488
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,980
What? Why am I going?

1489
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,980
Am I not?

1490
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:35,980
Am I the one flapping the wings?

1491
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,980
Am I not flapping karma?

1492
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,980
I'm trying!

1493
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,980
I don't know why it's low.

1494
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,980
You think I should go down?

1495
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,980
Can you...

1496
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,980
Be gentle.

1497
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,980
Is this not fast enough?

1498
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,980
I can't handle this.

1499
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,980
Okay, we're actually in the front.

1500
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:59,980
I feel like I'm the reason why this is not working.

1501
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:03,980
You're flapping so fast, the wings aren't even fucking moving.

1502
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,980
My thumb is cramping.

1503
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,980
What the fuck?

1504
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,980
I'm like, oh my god.

1505
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,980
Okay, I think I get it.

1506
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,980
Start, start, whatever.

1507
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,980
I can't get it here.

1508
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,980
It is what it is.

1509
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,980
I'm gonna try my best.

1510
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:27,980
I'm sorry, the polo.

1511
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,980
It's okay.

1512
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,980
Yeah, get the fuck out.

1513
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:35,980
Move, bitch.

1514
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,980
Get out the way.

1515
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,980
Get out the way.

1516
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:47,980
I'm flapping as hard as I can.

1517
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,980
Flip, flip.

1518
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,980
I'm flapping.

1519
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,980
Why did we get it twice?

1520
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,980
I'm so upset.

1521
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,980
I'm flapping as fast as I can.

1522
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,980
I don't think we can.

1523
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,980
It's like a sheebie.

1524
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,980
No.

1525
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,980
No.

1526
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,980
Okay, it's fine.

1527
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,980
What?

1528
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,980
We don't do it.

1529
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,980
We don't do it.

1530
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,980
I'm so sorry.

1531
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,980
Lesson learned.

1532
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,980
Don't let sheebie or me drive a car.

1533
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,980
I did almost get into a car accident today.

1534
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,980
Oh no.

1535
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,980
It wasn't my fault.

1536
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,980
It wasn't my fault.

1537
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:45,980
I'm not a bad driver.

1538
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,980
I'm a great driver.

1539
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,980
I believe you.

1540
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,980
It's just...

1541
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,980
Polo is such a gamer.

1542
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,980
Wait, we're finished?

1543
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,980
No, we're half.

1544
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,980
We're half.

1545
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,980
I was like, what?

1546
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,980
This is impossible.

1547
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,980
Am I in fourth?

1548
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:09,980
How are you in fourth?

1549
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,980
Don't you have more?

1550
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:13,980
I'm actually going to cry.

1551
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,980
Burp cry.

1552
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,980
Oh no.

1553
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,980
No, you're fine.

1554
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:29,980
Five out of ten.

1555
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,980
Okay, thank you for the nine out of ten rating.

1556
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,980
Appreciate you.

1557
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,980
Seven.

1558
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,980
Sorry.

1559
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,980
Let's hear a prediction

1560
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:43,980
from one of our board cores.

1561
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,980
Okay.

1562
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,980
Seems like Mario is the best chance.

1563
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,980
Probably. Let's go with that.

1564
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:55,980
I feel like that's a lie.

1565
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,980
Watch Mario.

1566
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,980
Watch Marcy win.

1567
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,980
What's a plunder, Sam?

1568
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:05,980
Why don't I get it?

1569
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,980
I'm in fourth, man.

1570
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,980
Oh yeah, I can feel it.

1571
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:11,980
Are you serious?

1572
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,980
Stay away from me right now.

1573
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,980
Oh, now the blue spaces give double now.

1574
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,980
And you also lose double.

1575
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,980
Damn.

1576
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,980
I am fighting whomever shares my space.

1577
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,980
I love being a thief.

1578
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,980
I love being a thief.

1579
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,980
I love being a thief.

1580
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,980
I love being a thief.

1581
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,980
Oh no.

1582
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:37,980
We pretty much all have items.

1583
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:39,980
Except for me.

1584
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,980
Except for me.

1585
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,980
I don't have any items.

1586
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:45,980
Okay, it's okay.

1587
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,980
If you get one, one, one.

1588
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,980
What?

1589
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,980
What?

1590
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,980
Oh my god.

1591
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,980
I don't believe her.

1592
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,980
That's 17 stars to get.

1593
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,980
Watch her get the right seed.

1594
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,980
No.

1595
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:09,980
Please don't pick the right one.

1596
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,980
It's my life.

1597
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,980
My bestie for charity.

1598
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,980
Oh my God.

1599
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:17,980
Are you serious?

1600
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,980
Are you serious?

1601
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:21,980
Lexie, not the bad.

1602
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:23,980
What the heck is this?

1603
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:25,980
I don't know what is going on.

1604
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:27,980
I emoted before it.

1605
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:29,980
I didn't even do it before.

1606
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:31,980
It did it by itself.

1607
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,980
I don't know what's going on.

1608
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,980
I'm crying.

1609
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,980
I don't know what's going on.

1610
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,980
I'm crying.

1611
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,980
What the hell?

1612
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,980
What the hell?

1613
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:45,980
How could this happen to me?

1614
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,980
I made my...

1615
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,980
You could have gotten a large one.

1616
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:51,980
That's what I was saying.

1617
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:53,980
I could, but I didn't like my coins.

1618
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,980
Oh my God.

1619
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,980
It's like my wife's bestie.

1620
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,980
You have two stars.

1621
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,980
I don't need any more coins.

1622
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,980
I like collecting the stars.

1623
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,980
What the heck?

1624
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:07,980
Give me your star.

1625
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,980
I'm going to get your star.

1626
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,980
I'm just going to...

1627
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,980
I'm just going to...

1628
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,980
I'm just going to...

1629
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,980
That's all I got to say.

1630
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,980
At least I can buy a fucking star.

1631
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,980
Now you're in second place.

1632
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,980
Yeah!

1633
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,980
You're going to be in second place now.

1634
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:29,980
You're in second place now. Congratulations!

1635
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:31,980
Hey, Lisa.

1636
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,980
I think it's to steal stars.

1637
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:35,980
Or I would lose my mind.

1638
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,980
Oh God.

1639
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,980
I don't want to buy anything.

1640
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,980
Because the Mercy is just going to steal it.

1641
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,980
I love stealing.

1642
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,980
Oh, true.

1643
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,980
I'm not even buying anything.

1644
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:49,980
Now we're fighting.

1645
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,980
I need to fight Mercy!

1646
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,980
Oh, shit!

1647
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,980
Oh, you guys can pick how many coins to win.

1648
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,980
I'm only going to do three.

1649
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:59,980
Well, I can only wage you five.

1650
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,980
I'll wage you all my coins.

1651
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,980
Okay.

1652
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:09,980
Wait, what did I click?

1653
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,980
I accidentally clicked the sticker thing.

1654
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:13,980
Sister versus sister.

1655
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,980
Oh, I got to pick.

1656
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,980
Ah!

1657
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,980
Damn!

1658
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,980
We just start punching each other?

1659
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,980
What's happening?

1660
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:31,980
What's this?

1661
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,980
What is this?

1662
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,980
Well, that looks easy.

1663
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:37,980
Never mind.

1664
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:43,980
Don't get too close. Stay back.

1665
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,980
What the fuck?

1666
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,980
What is that?

1667
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,980
Stay back.

1668
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,980
How am I supposed to get through this?

1669
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,980
Up and down, up and down.

1670
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,980
I can't go up and down.

1671
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,980
I'm not used to it.

1672
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:01,980
Oh my God.

1673
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:03,980
You're going to go slow.

1674
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,980
Okay.

1675
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:07,980
I have to go fast and hard.

1676
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,980
Thank you for training.

1677
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:11,980
Imagine somebody who's just listening

1678
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:13,980
watching what the fuck is going on.

1679
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,980
He's in!

1680
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,980
I'm going too rough.

1681
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,980
I got to be gentle.

1682
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,980
I like it rough, fast, hard.

1683
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:23,980
We're doing it.

1684
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,980
No questions.

1685
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,980
I don't care if I hurt myself.

1686
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,980
I'm plunging ahead.

1687
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,980
What the hell?

1688
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,980
All right.

1689
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:35,980
I'm ready.

1690
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:37,980
I'm not ready. What the hell?

1691
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,980
You got this?

1692
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,980
No, I don't.

1693
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:43,980
Why is my hitbox so large?

1694
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,980
Fuck.

1695
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,980
Fuck.

1696
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,980
Okay.

1697
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,980
I get it, but this is going to be hell.

1698
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,980
Why do I got to swim through space?

1699
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:57,980
I can't even breathe.

1700
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,980
I don't like swimming.

1701
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,980
I might swim like Eldritch MZ.

1702
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,980
Hello, Hades.

1703
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,980
I love you.

1704
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,980
Thank you so much for the raid, honey.

1705
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,980
Hi, Hades.

1706
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:11,980
I like how we both talk about the same thing.

1707
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,980
Balls in front of my face.

1708
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,980
That's all I know.

1709
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:19,980
Why are you doing the same exact thing?

1710
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:21,980
Hello, hello.

1711
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:23,980
Hi, Hades.

1712
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:25,980
Hades is the same shit.

1713
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:27,980
Please, I hope your stream was very lovely.

1714
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,980
I love this minigame.

1715
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,980
I love this. This is very chaotic.

1716
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,980
It's very fun.

1717
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:37,980
No, she's beating me.

1718
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:39,980
Damn, she's going hard.

1719
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:41,980
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1720
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,980
Oh, no.

1721
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:45,980
I don't want to win. No.

1722
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:47,980
Oh, my God.

1723
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,980
This is great.

1724
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:51,980
Let me in.

1725
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:53,980
I don't want to win.

1726
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:55,980
I don't want to win.

1727
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:57,980
No.

1728
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,980
No.

1729
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,980
Oh, my God.

1730
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,980
Oh, my God.

1731
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:05,980
Damn, mercy.

1732
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,980
Too many balls hit on her face.

1733
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,980
Damn.

1734
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:11,980
Damn.

1735
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,980
I'll be taking the coins back

1736
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,980
that you took from me.

1737
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,980
Thank you very much.

1738
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:19,980
Thank you, miss.

1739
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,980
Thank you very much.

1740
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:23,980
I love you, mercy.

1741
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,980
I love you so much, mercy.

1742
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,980
I'm so sorry. I just lost six of the coins,

1743
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:29,980
so it doesn't matter.

1744
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,980
Let's go.

1745
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:33,980
Let's go. Let's go.

1746
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,980
Oh, is it my turn?

1747
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,980
Okay, it's my, wait, hold up.

1748
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,980
You know what, wait.

1749
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:41,980
Let me see.

1750
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:43,980
Wait, now the snippets,

1751
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:45,980
now the senpais are going to come for me.

1752
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:47,980
No, they won't.

1753
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:49,980
No, they won't. I will, though.

1754
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,980
I'll be like, I'm used to this.

1755
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:53,980
I'll have you in my cage.

1756
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:55,980
I fell asleep to your ass.

1757
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,980
Oh, my compliment.

1758
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:59,980
Even though I was shaking the bars and stuff.

1759
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,980
Yeah, I literally knocked out.

1760
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,980
I was like, this is comfy.

1761
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:05,980
Let's go.

1762
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:07,980
Okay.

1763
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,980
Which seed?

1764
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,980
You know what? Oh.

1765
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,980
Oh.

1766
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:15,980
Pick your seed.

1767
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:17,980
Okay.

1768
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:19,980
So you have to give a

1769
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:21,980
kind of a big one.

1770
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:23,980
Or a little one.

1771
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,980
That one looks like my breast.

1772
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:27,980
So I'm going to.

1773
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,980
Ayo.

1774
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,980
Ayo.

1775
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:33,980
Welcome.

1776
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,980
Poggers.

1777
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,980
Oh, so that is good.

1778
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,980
Oh, I thought it was bad.

1779
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,980
I don't get to see daddy.

1780
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,980
I'm so sad.

1781
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,980
Dude.

1782
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,980
I wanted to see that.

1783
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:49,980
Welcome to the Chance Time Space.

1784
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,980
Make your dream come true.

1785
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:53,980
Stars and points will move from player to player.

1786
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,980
Exactly.

1787
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,980
Keep in mind.

1788
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,980
You can lose your star to one of us, though.

1789
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,980
No.

1790
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,980
No.

1791
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,980
Okay, let's go.

1792
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,980
Hi, honey.

1793
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,980
Oh.

1794
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,980
No.

1795
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:13,980
No.

1796
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,980
Give Kona points.

1797
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:17,980
Two.

1798
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:19,980
Mercy.

1799
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,980
Pay up.

1800
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:23,980
Damn.

1801
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:25,980
Damn it.

1802
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:27,980
I wish it were me.

1803
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:29,980
Yeah.

1804
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,980
No.

1805
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,980
I'm back down to the last Monday.

1806
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:35,980
Monday.

1807
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:37,980
Monday.

1808
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:39,980
Mommy, mommy, mommy.

1809
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,980
No.

1810
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:43,980
It's one of your guys's turn with Bowser now.

1811
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,980
Wait, never mind.

1812
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:49,980
I have to use the last one because I'm going to end up with Bowsy Boo anyways.

1813
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,980
Mystical.

1814
01:35:57,980 --> 01:35:59,980
You have a 50-50 chance.

1815
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:01,980
You do.

1816
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:03,980
Follow your heart.

1817
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:05,980
Damn.

1818
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,980
The green one looks cute.

1819
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:13,980
Catch a tiger by the toe.

1820
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:15,980
If he hollers, let him go.

1821
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,980
Oh, god. I didn't notice freaking bow on the top left.

1822
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,980
Yeah, you like my pregnant bow?

1823
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,980
She's so hot.

1824
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,980
Pregnant bow?

1825
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:25,980
Yeah.

1826
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,980
Throw me to the wolves and I'll come back pregnant.

1827
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,980
Damn.

1828
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:31,980
I think I might have a pregnancy.

1829
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:33,980
What?

1830
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:35,980
What?

1831
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,980
Oh, shit.

1832
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,980
Elaborate, please.

1833
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:41,980
I don't know.

1834
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:43,980
Breeding kink?

1835
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,980
Do you want to be bred?

1836
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:47,980
Yes, I do.

1837
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,980
I have a breeding kink.

1838
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:51,980
Not all my mods joining in.

1839
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,980
I just got in here.

1840
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,980
Honestly, I'm going to have to agree on that.

1841
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,980
Thank you.

1842
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,980
When I ran into this video

1843
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:03,980
where the girl was pregnant,

1844
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,980
I was like, wait, I kind of like...

1845
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:07,980
Why do I...

1846
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:09,980
Maybe for me, not the preynib,

1847
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:11,980
but like the breeding part, you know?

1848
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:13,980
Breeding is kind of wholesome.

1849
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:15,980
Yeah.

1850
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:17,980
I like breeding my little boy sluts.

1851
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,980
Wait!

1852
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,980
My hair knows.

1853
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,980
I know where to save you.

1854
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,980
Pregnant bow.

1855
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,980
Oh, it's this one.

1856
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:29,980
Oh, it's me and Mercy this time.

1857
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:31,980
Sorry, I'm the worst.

1858
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,980
Oh!

1859
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,980
Oh, okay. I have Apollo on my team.

1860
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:37,980
We got this.

1861
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:39,980
We have to work together.

1862
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,980
I'm trying.

1863
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:43,980
We got this, Apollo.

1864
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,980
Whee!

1865
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,980
Fact!

1866
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,980
Fact!

1867
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:51,980
Oh!

1868
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,980
I'm behind the road.

1869
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:55,980
Okay, we go left.

1870
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,980
I think we should slow down at like the hard turn.

1871
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,980
Right?

1872
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:01,980
Fast, fast, fast.

1873
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:03,980
I'm going to step on the gas.

1874
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:05,980
I'm going to step on the gas.

1875
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,980
How do you accelerate in a bobsled?

1876
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:09,980
I don't know.

1877
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:11,980
Ah!

1878
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,980
Why are we against the wall?

1879
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,980
Ah!

1880
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:17,980
You know what? I'm ready.

1881
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:19,980
All right, I'm ready.

1882
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:21,980
Okay.

1883
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,980
Okay.

1884
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,980
I'm ready then.

1885
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,980
I didn't know we could fall.

1886
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,980
No, it's okay. It's fine.

1887
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,980
It's okay.

1888
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:33,980
We got this. We fall off.

1889
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:35,980
I hope that doesn't make us auto lose.

1890
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,980
Okay.

1891
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,980
We're making a left turn.

1892
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,980
Oh my god, they're on our booty cheeks.

1893
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:47,980
Give me that, buddy.

1894
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,980
Oh, fuck.

1895
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:51,980
Oh, fuck.

1896
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:53,980
It's fine.

1897
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,980
Let's go!

1898
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,980
Yeah!

1899
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:59,980
I think it's me.

1900
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,980
I'm so sorry.

1901
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,980
No, you're fine.

1902
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,980
Wait, we're doing this.

1903
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,980
Sort of. We're doing it. We're doing it, Marcy.

1904
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,980
We're doing it.

1905
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,980
No, you're not.

1906
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,980
Dad, I swear I could drive a car.

1907
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,980
I have my license.

1908
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:19,980
I have my license.

1909
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:21,980
Oh, no, we're good.

1910
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,980
Stay close to the wall.

1911
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,980
We're good. We're good.

1912
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:27,980
We're good.

1913
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,980
My thumb hurts so bad.

1914
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,980
Where the fuck did they go?

1915
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:45,980
Damn!

1916
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,980
We did it!

1917
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,980
Damn it.

1918
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,980
We did it!

1919
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:53,980
Oh my god.

1920
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,980
I think it's me. I think I'm the common link.

1921
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,980
I apologize.

1922
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:59,980
I don't know how to do this.

1923
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:01,980
We're still at the bottom.

1924
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,980
I didn't even know what it was doing.

1925
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:05,980
I'm just pressing the button.

1926
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:11,980
Also, it's not you.

1927
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:13,980
I think...

1928
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,980
They're just gamers, to be honest.

1929
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:17,980
Oh, are you saying I'm not a gamer?

1930
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:19,980
They're just gamers.

1931
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,980
We're just gamers?

1932
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:23,980
You're like the gamer.

1933
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:25,980
And I'm like...

1934
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:27,980
I'm not the gamer.

1935
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,980
Wait, aren't you? You play souls like.

1936
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,980
That doesn't mean I'm a gamer.

1937
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,980
I'm not good at them.

1938
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:35,980
That makes you like...

1939
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,980
Gamer, gamer, you know?

1940
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:39,980
You can ask my hair members.

1941
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,980
They know I'm shit at the game.

1942
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:43,980
No, harems! Tell! Tell!

1943
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,980
I'm Paolo right now.

1944
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:47,980
She is as great at games.

1945
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:49,980
I'm pretty sure.

1946
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:51,980
I don't even want to talk about my Elden Ring gameplay.

1947
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,980
I couldn't even get to the boss

1948
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,980
because I was just like, I'm just so shit at this game.

1949
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:57,980
So let me just level up.

1950
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:01,980
I'm going to take my four coins.

1951
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:03,980
Oh, come on.

1952
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:05,980
Everyone says you're just being modest.

1953
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,980
Being modest?

1954
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:11,980
Pick whatever your heart tells you to pick.

1955
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:13,980
Do I tap on it? How the heck do I...

1956
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:15,980
How the heck do I...

1957
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:17,980
Oh, I want this one.

1958
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:23,980
Which one is it?

1959
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,980
Looks like it's getting sucked into a booty hole.

1960
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,980
Booty, booty, booty, booty.

1961
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:31,980
I love that song.

1962
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:33,980
I don't have any money, Bowser.

1963
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,980
What are you going to do?

1964
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:37,980
Booty, booty, booty, booty.

1965
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:39,980
Again?!

1966
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:41,980
Again?!

1967
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:43,980
Damn.

1968
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:45,980
Sweet.

1969
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:47,980
We have to get to the jewel

1970
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,980
because you don't have any money.

1971
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,980
Wow!

1972
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:53,980
I don't have any money, so we can't duel.

1973
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:55,980
She broke.

1974
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,980
I can't.

1975
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,980
She broke.

1976
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:01,980
No, so close.

1977
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,980
Let's go.

1978
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,980
It's my turn.

1979
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:11,980
Uh-oh.

1980
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:13,980
These chocolates look so good.

1981
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:15,980
I'm so hungry for sweets now.

1982
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,980
Can you get that Muppet off screen?

1983
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:21,980
It's going to make me act up.

1984
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:23,980
No.

1985
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:25,980
I'm dead.

1986
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,980
The Muppet stays on.

1987
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,980
The Muppet watches.

1988
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,980
I need art of me

1989
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,980
doing chat while having my Muppet

1990
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,980
in one hand, but it's a double team.

1991
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:39,980
You stare into the Muppet

1992
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:41,980
and say apps.

1993
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,980
I don't know if you can handle it.

1994
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,980
I don't think I can, to be honest.

1995
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:49,980
No!

1996
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,980
Don't rob me!

1997
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:53,980
Walk away!

1998
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:55,980
I've been robbed.

1999
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:57,980
I'm so sorry.

2000
01:42:57,980 --> 01:42:59,980
No, you're not!

2001
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,980
I'm sorry!

2002
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:05,980
Just a little.

2003
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:07,980
This happened to me.

2004
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,980
If you're not, it's Muppet.

2005
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:13,980
You're wrong.

2006
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,980
Thank you, Serenity.

2007
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:17,980
She says, and that's sorry at all.

2008
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:19,980
Okay, maybe a little.

2009
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,980
Okay.

2010
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:23,980
19 coins!

2011
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:25,980
My coins!

2012
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,980
My coins!

2013
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:29,980
Son of a bitch!

2014
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:31,980
Hmm.

2015
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,980
Oh, you have to pick an item to get rid of.

2016
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,980
That works out.

2017
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,980
He basically just got nothing.

2018
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,980
He just got nothing.

2019
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,980
Uh-oh!

2020
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:49,980
Oh, no! This could change it all!

2021
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,980
No!

2022
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,980
When I steered us to victory.

2023
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,980
If I give my stars to anyone,

2024
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:59,980
I'm crying.

2025
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:01,980
I'm going to cry.

2026
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:03,980
I'm shibbing my pants right now.

2027
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:05,980
Okay, here we go.

2028
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:07,980
Here we go.

2029
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:11,980
Again?

2030
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:13,980
Okay, that's not bad.

2031
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,980
That's not bad.

2032
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:21,980
It's fine.

2033
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:23,980
Like an awkwardly look at each other.

2034
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,980
I'm sorry.

2035
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:33,980
I'm a saudi.

2036
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:37,980
Pain.

2037
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,980
Pain.

2038
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,980
That was right.

2039
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:43,980
Pain day.

2040
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:45,980
What does that mean?

2041
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,980
Like Texas Apocalypse.

2042
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,980
Open a box?

2043
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:51,980
What's this mean?

2044
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:53,980
I thought it meant open a bomb.

2045
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:59,980
No.

2046
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,980
Oh.

2047
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:05,980
Oh, you have to remember what's in the boxes.

2048
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:09,980
Oh!

2049
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:11,980
What the hell is that?

2050
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:13,980
I'm getting punched.

2051
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:15,980
Am I getting coins?

2052
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:17,980
Oh, try to open boxes with coins in them.

2053
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:19,980
Okay.

2054
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,980
I got it.

2055
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:25,980
Okay, I kind of get it.

2056
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:27,980
This is kind of hard.

2057
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:29,980
Yeah, I can't remember.

2058
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:33,980
I can't remember which box is which.

2059
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:35,980
It's memory.

2060
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:37,980
I don't have good memory.

2061
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,980
That's the thing!

2062
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:43,980
I thought it was a chef hat in there.

2063
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:45,980
I don't have any of them.

2064
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:49,980
I wonder what the sac of money does.

2065
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:57,980
A pollo?

2066
01:45:57,980 --> 01:45:59,980
Oh.

2067
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:01,980
I just blew myself off.

2068
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:05,980
I thought you were saying you just blew yourself off.

2069
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:07,980
This is a terrible airport.

2070
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,980
I'm gonna die.

2071
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,980
Oh.

2072
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:17,980
Oh.

2073
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:19,980
No, for sure not that one.

2074
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:35,980
Oh.

2075
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:37,980
Shit.

2076
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,980
Oh.

2077
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:43,980
No!

2078
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,980
My memory!

2079
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:47,980
I was trying so hard to remember.

2080
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:49,980
I'm glad my memory is still good.

2081
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,980
Sort of.

2082
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:53,980
My memory is terrible.

2083
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,980
My goldfish brain couldn't be bought.

2084
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,980
I'm still in fourth. Dang it.

2085
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,980
So mercy.

2086
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:03,980
My life is in half.

2087
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,980
There's also the other stars.

2088
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:07,980
There's also the other stars at the end.

2089
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:09,980
The bonus stars.

2090
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:11,980
What's your bonus stars?

2091
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:13,980
I need my one star!

2092
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:15,980
Come on!

2093
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:17,980
What?

2094
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:19,980
I'm sorry.

2095
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:21,980
There's no one fucking way!

2096
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:23,980
There's no one!

2097
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:25,980
There's no one!

2098
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:31,980
I hate you.

2099
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:33,980
I'm sorry.

2100
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,980
I'm sorry.

2101
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:39,980
Why is Donkey Kong

2102
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:41,980
just like

2103
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:43,980
chocolatey cheeked up over there?

2104
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:45,980
I know.

2105
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:47,980
Oh, great.

2106
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:49,980
Now I get to talk to Bowser.

2107
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:51,980
Maybe he'll show pity on you.

2108
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:53,980
But are you sorry?

2109
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:55,980
I mean, I'm sorry.

2110
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,980
No, we're not compatible.

2111
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:59,980
We're two doms.

2112
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,980
So it's not gonna work out between us.

2113
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:03,980
We're battling for dominance.

2114
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:05,980
I could kind of hunt.

2115
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,980
But I'm a swish.

2116
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:09,980
I'm not very dominant.

2117
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:11,980
Praise the sun.

2118
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:13,980
Praise the sun.

2119
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:17,980
Great. I have four coins.

2120
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:19,980
You guys got to start praying

2121
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,980
for your Kohai's right now.

2122
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:27,980
Why did you have to rob me like this, bro?

2123
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:29,980
Alright.

2124
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,980
This is it.

2125
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:41,980
Look out, she's...

2126
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,980
You know what?

2127
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,980
This is...

2128
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:47,980
It's so bad.

2129
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:51,980
Alright!

2130
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,980
We pray every day.

2131
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:55,980
Oh, your community is still wholesome.

2132
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:57,980
They're so kind.

2133
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:59,980
Look at you.

2134
01:48:59,980 --> 01:49:01,980
They're praying for you.

2135
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:03,980
Yeah, you give her energy.

2136
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:09,980
I don't know if that was bad or good.

2137
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:11,980
Wait!

2138
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,980
It was bad!

2139
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,980
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, Sheebie.

2140
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:17,980
Oh, I was so close.

2141
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:19,980
Now I'm gonna be in third.

2142
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:21,980
You're not a star.

2143
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:23,980
I might...

2144
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,980
Let's go!

2145
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:27,980
I'm not even emoting.

2146
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:29,980
It just doesn't buy itself.

2147
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,980
It's not for me to pull out a fight.

2148
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:33,980
Oh, shit.

2149
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:35,980
Why is it always Jen against their own Jen?

2150
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:37,980
How many are we waiting?

2151
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,980
I'm down away, you're dead.

2152
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:41,980
Okay, sure.

2153
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:43,980
Oh, god.

2154
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,980
Ten coins!

2155
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:47,980
What?

2156
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,980
It's time to tool.

2157
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:51,980
It's time to...

2158
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:53,980
I don't know what I'm doing.

2159
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:55,980
I'm scared.

2160
01:49:55,980 --> 01:49:57,980
Let's get ready to rumble!

2161
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:03,980
Let's get ready to rumble!

2162
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:07,980
What do I do?

2163
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:09,980
What are we doing?

2164
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:11,980
Oh, god.

2165
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,980
I'm so nervous.

2166
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:15,980
Is this Mario?

2167
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,980
Is this Mario Kart or something?

2168
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:19,980
Mario Hover.

2169
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,980
Oh, I see.

2170
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:23,980
I was looking at your character.

2171
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:25,980
I was like, why is it moving?

2172
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:27,980
You do look almost the same.

2173
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,980
Yeah, I mean, you do look almost the same.

2174
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:31,980
Remember, you're blue.

2175
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,980
You know, like...

2176
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:35,980
Yeah, you're blue.

2177
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:37,980
You don't want to hit the electricity.

2178
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:39,980
They're excited.

2179
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:41,980
Water conducts electricity, you're right.

2180
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:43,980
Oh, no.

2181
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:45,980
You want to go through the opening that isn't...

2182
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:47,980
Yeah, like that.

2183
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:49,980
Okay, the controls feel weird.

2184
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:51,980
Ah, no!

2185
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:53,980
You did it, though.

2186
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,980
Okay, I get it. I get it.

2187
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:57,980
I think I get it, too.

2188
01:50:57,980 --> 01:50:59,980
You can do it. You can do it.

2189
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,980
I want to commentate.

2190
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:03,980
Stop.

2191
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:05,980
Okay, so...

2192
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:07,980
Starting off strong.

2193
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:09,980
We have both girls on the right side coming through the hole.

2194
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:11,980
They are neck-and-neck, folks.

2195
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,980
Wow, they are neck-and-neck.

2196
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:17,980
Ha ha ha ha!

2197
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:19,980
Ha ha ha!

2198
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,980
Ha ha ha!

2199
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:23,980
Ha ha ha!

2200
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:25,980
Ha ha ha!

2201
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:27,980
Ha ha ha!

2202
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:29,980
Ha ha ha!

2203
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:31,980
Ha ha ha!

2204
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,980
Ha ha ha!

2205
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:35,980
Wait, who got first?

2206
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:37,980
I don't know.

2207
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,980
Wait, who got first?

2208
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:41,980
I don't know.

2209
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:43,980
Ha ha ha!

2210
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:45,980
We don't look the same.

2211
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:47,980
Let's go!

2212
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:49,980
The controls for that are so weird.

2213
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:51,980
I'm like, I can't do it.

2214
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:53,980
That looked weird.

2215
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:55,980
That looked hard.

2216
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:59,980
When I was younger, I wanted to be a CS go commentator.

2217
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,980
How young am I?

2218
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:03,980
I can't go into the electricity.

2219
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:05,980
Can you blame me? I like to electrify myself.

2220
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:07,980
Wait, hold on. Maybe I'll use an animal.

2221
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:09,980
It's electric.

2222
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:11,980
Do you like getting shot?

2223
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:13,980
Yes.

2224
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,980
Here we go!

2225
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:19,980
I have a taser.

2226
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:21,980
I have a shock collar.

2227
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:23,980
I also have a shock collar.

2228
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,980
Oh my god, that's right.

2229
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:27,980
We can't use it.

2230
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,980
It's Twitch TOS.

2231
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,980
It's Twitch TOS.

2232
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:33,980
What about YouTube?

2233
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:35,980
Please, baby girl.

2234
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:37,980
I got you.

2235
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,980
Give me a star, finally!

2236
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:41,980
I'm going to be like Harley Quinn.

2237
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:43,980
Ha ha ha ha!

2238
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:45,980
Electrifying.

2239
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:49,980
Money, give me money again.

2240
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:51,980
I just walked out of my bedroom.

2241
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,980
What the fuck are you doing?

2242
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:57,980
I moved me with you.

2243
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:59,980
Oh my gosh, I almost read that as Bowser's big breast.

2244
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:01,980
Ha ha ha ha!

2245
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,980
You suck on Bowser's titty.

2246
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:05,980
Yeah.

2247
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:07,980
Oh, this is like a racing one.

2248
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:09,980
Okay, this is fun.

2249
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:11,980
Oh shit.

2250
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:13,980
Oh, you can spin out?

2251
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:15,980
I don't understand how that works.

2252
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,980
Oh my god, I got thrown out.

2253
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,980
I got kicked out.

2254
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:21,980
Of the game?

2255
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:23,980
No, they're gone.

2256
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:25,980
They swooned me over, but yeah.

2257
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:27,980
Okay, I'm dead.

2258
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:29,980
So try four naps to watch your speed.

2259
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:31,980
If you run too fast around the curbs,

2260
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,980
we'll make you spin out to be careful.

2261
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:35,980
Oh, okay, okay, I get it.

2262
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:39,980
How do I want to spin off of the map?

2263
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:43,980
That sounds like fun.

2264
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,980
Oh, I get it.

2265
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:49,980
Okay, I think I get it.

2266
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:51,980
I get it.

2267
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,980
Okay, I think I get it, but I'm not going to be great at it.

2268
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:55,980
We neither.

2269
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:57,980
Apologies.

2270
01:53:57,980 --> 01:53:59,980
Oh, fair enough.

2271
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:01,980
I'm trying.

2272
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:03,980
I'm going to try my best.

2273
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:05,980
Hello, thank you so much for following, honey.

2274
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:07,980
Can you say that again?

2275
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:09,980
Well, like, with Mercy instead of Honey?

2276
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:11,980
Oh, uh,

2277
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:13,980
I believe so.

2278
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:17,980
I think, I think maybe not.

2279
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:19,980
I don't think I can.

2280
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:21,980
Can you?

2281
01:54:25,980 --> 01:54:27,980
No.

2282
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:31,980
Oh, I'm doing it.

2283
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:33,980
I'm doing it.

2284
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,980
I'm doing it.

2285
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:37,980
I still don't get this.

2286
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:43,980
Yeah!

2287
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:45,980
I was so close.

2288
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:47,980
See, look, I can drive chat.

2289
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:49,980
I swear I have my license.

2290
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:51,980
I was so close.

2291
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,980
We did all dial in.

2292
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:55,980
We're focused.

2293
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,980
We're locked in, baby girl.

2294
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:03,980
I can't believe I came in fourth.

2295
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:09,980
Who's fourth?

2296
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:11,980
Mercy, I'm reaching through the screen

2297
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,980
and I'm just grabbing you by the throat.

2298
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:15,980
I'm really, I'm choking your model.

2299
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:17,980
I'm reaching at my screen right now.

2300
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:19,980
Just...

2301
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:25,980
Just...

2302
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:31,980
I love your laugh so much.

2303
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:39,980
Her evil little laugh.

2304
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:41,980
Yeah, she does like it.

2305
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:43,980
I should know better.

2306
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,980
She likes being choked.

2307
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,980
She'll just laugh hilariously

2308
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:49,980
while she's being choked.

2309
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:51,980
Oh God.

2310
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:53,980
Excuse me, may I please be choked too?

2311
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,980
Of course, sweetheart.

2312
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:57,980
Oh my God.

2313
01:55:57,980 --> 01:55:59,980
Thank you.

2314
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:01,980
Slide back on the bed.

2315
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,980
Oh, shit.

2316
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:05,980
Oh my God.

2317
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:07,980
And squeeze ever so tight.

2318
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,980
Sorry, sorry. The Patreon voice came out.

2319
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:17,980
I apologize.

2320
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:19,980
Please, please continue.

2321
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:21,980
Please continue.

2322
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:23,980
Make the one that looks like my boob again.

2323
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,980
The boobies.

2324
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:29,980
The boobies.

2325
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:31,980
Yeah!

2326
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:33,980
Oh my God.

2327
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:35,980
It literally shaped like my perky ass boobies.

2328
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,980
Oh my God.

2329
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:41,980
So about those...

2330
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:43,980
Those boobies?

2331
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,980
Yes.

2332
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:47,980
They look so heavy.

2333
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,980
Is that for you?

2334
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:51,980
Can I have one and then Mercy has the other?

2335
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:53,980
Yes.

2336
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:55,980
Hell yeah.

2337
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,980
They hurt, they hurt. I need help.

2338
01:56:57,980 --> 01:56:59,980
I need assistance.

2339
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:01,980
If only there were two beautiful girls

2340
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:03,980
who are a bunny and have a suit.

2341
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,980
He's gonna help me.

2342
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:07,980
Oh no.

2343
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,980
What you cut out.

2344
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:13,980
Oh no.

2345
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:15,980
I will live.

2346
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:17,980
There is, there baby.

2347
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:33,980
What are you buying?

2348
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:35,980
What are you selling?

2349
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:37,980
My body.

2350
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,980
You know, I run a brothel.

2351
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:43,980
I think you would make a great addition.

2352
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:45,980
It's called Wonderland.

2353
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:47,980
We're having interviews this Sunday.

2354
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:49,980
I don't know if you're free.

2355
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,980
Damn, I'm always free for you.

2356
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:53,980
Oh, okay.

2357
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:55,980
I'm gonna cry. Please don't.

2358
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,980
No.

2359
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:59,980
Oh yeah, I'm safe.

2360
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:01,980
Yay, good for you, Mercy.

2361
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:07,980
Oh yeah.

2362
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:11,980
Oh no, it's me and Mercy's time to fight.

2363
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:13,980
It's time to...

2364
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:15,980
For fuck's sake.

2365
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:17,980
How many, how many, how many you want to...

2366
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:19,980
I only want to...

2367
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:21,980
What if they kiss?

2368
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:23,980
Never mind. I said one.

2369
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:25,980
One...

2370
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:27,980
One coin?

2371
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:29,980
One coin?

2372
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:31,980
I'm a coward.

2373
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,980
Come on, Mercy. Go hard or go home.

2374
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:35,980
I'm a coward. I'm a coward.

2375
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:37,980
You could have pulled in a second with this one.

2376
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:39,980
I'm sorry.

2377
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,980
I can't like, double tap.

2378
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:47,980
That was my badge.

2379
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:49,980
That was my badge.

2380
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:51,980
What the heck is this?

2381
01:58:51,980 --> 01:58:53,980
Man, I wish I had this.

2382
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:55,980
That would be gorgeous.

2383
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:57,980
Fuck!

2384
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:59,980
Shit.

2385
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:01,980
Oh, this is the worst.

2386
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:03,980
This is the worst. I hate jumping.

2387
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:05,980
Rump.

2388
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:07,980
Hickory dickory, doc.

2389
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:09,980
Mario went up the jump.

2390
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:11,980
The clocks.

2391
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:13,980
Mercy had to pee.

2392
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,980
Mercy!

2393
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:17,980
I could have to pee.

2394
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:19,980
Oh my god, you are not real.

2395
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:23,980
You are not real.

2396
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:29,980
Just follow.

2397
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:31,980
I hate jumping.

2398
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:33,980
Picks Mario.

2399
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:35,980
Listen.

2400
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:37,980
He has my needle.

2401
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:39,980
He has my needle.

2402
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:41,980
He has my needle.

2403
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:43,980
I'm gonna use your restroom.

2404
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:47,980
I'm gonna get this.

2405
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:49,980
Probably.

2406
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:53,980
Okay, I think I can do it.

2407
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:55,980
I'm in hell.

2408
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:57,980
Wait, I went forward.

2409
01:59:57,980 --> 01:59:59,980
I'm in hell.

2410
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:01,980
It goes backwards and forwards.

2411
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:07,980
Mercy!

2412
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,980
At least he only wagered one.

2413
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:19,980
He immediately dies.

2414
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:25,980
Look at Mario's face. It's such a mood.

2415
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:31,980
Oh god.

2416
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:33,980
Oh my god.

2417
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:37,980
How did we punch at the air?

2418
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:41,980
It's okay. You got 20 coins.

2419
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:43,980
It's fine. You got more coins than I did.

2420
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:45,980
Oh my god.

2421
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:51,980
What the heck is this?

2422
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:53,980
Cheep cheep.

2423
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:55,980
Are we grabbing cheep cheeps?

2424
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:57,980
Oh, never mind.

2425
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:59,980
We are avoiding.

2426
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:01,980
Wait, what?

2427
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,980
How are we supposed to...

2428
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:05,980
Oh, dive.

2429
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:07,980
How do you dive?

2430
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,980
Wait, how do you do this again?

2431
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:11,980
You have to hold down the joystick.

2432
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:13,980
Pull it down.

2433
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:23,980
Did you guys hear my toilet?

2434
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:25,980
What?

2435
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:27,980
Did you wash?

2436
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:29,980
Wait, were you peeing?

2437
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:31,980
Yeah, I went to go pee.

2438
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:33,980
You were peeing on Mike?

2439
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:35,980
No.

2440
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:37,980
Well, she probably muted her stream but didn't mute her.

2441
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:39,980
Okay, I'm sorry. I don't get this.

2442
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,980
How do I dive?

2443
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:43,980
You pull the joystick down.

2444
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:45,980
Okay, like right in front of it?

2445
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:47,980
Yeah.

2446
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:49,980
Like towards you.

2447
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:51,980
Fuck!

2448
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:53,980
Oh.

2449
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:55,980
Yeah.

2450
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,980
Like towards you.

2451
02:01:57,980 --> 02:01:59,980
Fuck!

2452
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:01,980
Oh, no.

2453
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:03,980
Oh, no, no, no.

2454
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:05,980
Wow, Pixelmia, thank you for the rain.

2455
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:07,980
Jesus.

2456
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:09,980
Oh my god.

2457
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:11,980
Hold down while mashing A.

2458
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:13,980
Oh, okay.

2459
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:17,980
I feel like I almost got it but at the same time I don't.

2460
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:19,980
I don't got it.

2461
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:21,980
I'm gonna just die.

2462
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:23,980
Poseidon's winning this one.

2463
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:25,980
Poseidon's winning this one.

2464
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:27,980
This is the water.

2465
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:29,980
This is the water buff.

2466
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:33,980
I'm not even paying attention in the beginning

2467
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:35,980
and I keep getting sucked in.

2468
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:39,980
Would you like to start?

2469
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:43,980
Wait, I think I got it.

2470
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:45,980
You gotta time the dives though.

2471
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:47,980
Yeah.

2472
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:49,980
I think I got it.

2473
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:51,980
You wanna mash right at the beginning

2474
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:53,980
or you're gonna get sucked in?

2475
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:55,980
Oh, whoops, I didn't mean to skip.

2476
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:05,980
No mercy!

2477
02:03:05,980 --> 02:03:07,980
Oh, no.

2478
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:09,980
It's over now.

2479
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:15,980
Oh, they're moving.

2480
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:17,980
No!

2481
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:21,980
Oh, you all won!

2482
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:23,980
We lose.

2483
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:27,980
My favorite.

2484
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:29,980
Wow, Luigi, eat my titties.

2485
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:35,980
I'm gonna cry.

2486
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:37,980
Wow, it made such a difference.

2487
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:39,980
I'm gonna cry.

2488
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:41,980
What's that?

2489
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:43,980
This is the final turn.

2490
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,980
We're gonna get bonus stars.

2491
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:47,980
The final stretch.

2492
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:57,980
Damn, she's zooming.

2493
02:03:57,980 --> 02:03:59,980
Peach is like, I got places to be.

2494
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:05,980
I don't have any items.

2495
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:07,980
I have a cursed dice block.

2496
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:09,980
What do you expect me to do with that chat?

2497
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:11,980
I think you can give it to someone else.

2498
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:15,980
Look.

2499
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:17,980
I'm giving it to Apollo.

2500
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:19,980
Oh, my God!

2501
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:21,980
I'm shitting me right now.

2502
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:23,980
Oh, God, to see Bowser!

2503
02:04:23,980 --> 02:04:25,980
What the fuck?

2504
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:27,980
But I wanna see Bowser.

2505
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:31,980
No!

2506
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:33,980
Oh, shit!

2507
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:35,980
Oh, my God, all three of them are killing me.

2508
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:37,980
This is gonna be fun to watch.

2509
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,980
Oh, you can choose who you wanna fight.

2510
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:41,980
Choose.

2511
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:43,980
Damn, I wish I was there.

2512
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:45,980
No!

2513
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:47,980
Just feel like bullying me now!

2514
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:49,980
Will you accept this, Rose?

2515
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:51,980
I'm on that vibe.

2516
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:53,980
It's time to cast.

2517
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:55,980
It's time for my voice casting.

2518
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:03,980
I'm ready.

2519
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:05,980
Stop.

2520
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:11,980
Mercy has just been getting bullied.

2521
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:15,980
This whole time.

2522
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:17,980
Wait for all your coins, you fool.

2523
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:19,980
Okay, I'm gonna go pee guys while

2524
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,980
you guys do this.

2525
02:05:21,980 --> 02:05:23,980
I'll be back.

2526
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:25,980
Go piss, girl.

2527
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:29,980
God!

2528
02:05:33,980 --> 02:05:35,980
Wow!

2529
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:45,980
It's okay.

2530
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:47,980
It's fun.

2531
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:49,980
Oh, yeah.

2532
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:03,980
I love Bowser.

2533
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:05,980
Oh.

2534
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:07,980
What's this?

2535
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:13,980
It's a spin doctor.

2536
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:19,980
I don't know where I'm going.

2537
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:21,980
Yeah, where's the ending pose?

2538
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:23,980
How am I supposed to cast this?

2539
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:31,980
Oh.

2540
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:33,980
Oh, dang it.

2541
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:39,980
Where's the way?

2542
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:41,980
I have no idea.

2543
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:43,980
I think it's in the top right corner.

2544
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:49,980
Yeah, it is.

2545
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:51,980
This is hard.

2546
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:55,980
Okay, I was just trying to find

2547
02:06:55,980 --> 02:06:57,980
the exit then.

2548
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:05,980
And there's the ending!

2549
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:09,980
Let's get ready to spin!

2550
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:11,980
Oh, with this one!

2551
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:13,980
I hate this one.

2552
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:15,980
This one stresses me out.

2553
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:17,980
And they are off.

2554
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:19,980
Mercy immediately jumping in.

2555
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:21,980
So is Apollo. Both going straight,

2556
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:23,980
waiting, turning.

2557
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:27,980
They're matching each other's speed.

2558
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:29,980
Neither one is ahead.

2559
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:31,980
Uh-oh.

2560
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:33,980
Apollo pulls ahead.

2561
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,980
Mercy taking it right.

2562
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,980
Oh, shit.

2563
02:07:37,980 --> 02:07:39,980
They realize that they're both trapped in this area.

2564
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:41,980
They need to go in a different direction.

2565
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:43,980
Oh, shit.

2566
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:45,980
And then they're just spinning in circles.

2567
02:07:45,980 --> 02:07:47,980
Mercy is going backwards.

2568
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:51,980
And so is Apollo.

2569
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:53,980
They're both confusedly

2570
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:55,980
getting into the little spinning thing.

2571
02:07:57,980 --> 02:07:59,980
Apollo pulls up straight.

2572
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:01,980
So...

2573
02:08:01,980 --> 02:08:03,980
Oh, no!

2574
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:05,980
Apollo misses. Mercy manages to get in.

2575
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:07,980
She is pulling ahead, folks.

2576
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:11,980
She is zooming through very close to the goal.

2577
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,980
Apollo not so close behind.

2578
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:17,980
Oh, my God.

2579
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:19,980
Oh, shit.

2580
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,980
Oh, shit.

2581
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:23,980
Oh, shit.

2582
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,980
Oh, my God.

2583
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:27,980
Then I was like,

2584
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:29,980
we need a millisecond.

2585
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:31,980
The crowd goes wild.

2586
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:37,980
Oh, my God.

2587
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,980
That really was a millisecond.

2588
02:08:39,980 --> 02:08:41,980
Can we get a replay of that?

2589
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,980
I know. We need a replay.

2590
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:45,980
I'm watching them back on, like,

2591
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:47,980
fucking Vaughn.

2592
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:49,980
Holy shit.

2593
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:53,980
I know the silence from both of you.

2594
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:55,980
They're all locked in.

2595
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:59,980
Look at that. They prayed.

2596
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:01,980
They prayed so hard.

2597
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:03,980
They got it!

2598
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:05,980
I'm sorry.

2599
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:07,980
I'm so done!

2600
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:09,980
I'm so...

2601
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:11,980
I'm sorry.

2602
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:13,980
I hate it here.

2603
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:15,980
This is my final turn.

2604
02:09:15,980 --> 02:09:17,980
31!

2605
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:19,980
Hold up.

2606
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:21,980
Who is...

2607
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:23,980
Is anybody close?

2608
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:25,980
Okay.

2609
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:27,980
Everybody's on the shame block.

2610
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:29,980
So, you know what?

2611
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:31,980
I will take my chances.

2612
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:35,980
Wow, it literally was like a millisecond.

2613
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:37,980
Oh, shit.

2614
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:43,980
I took my chances, okay?

2615
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:45,980
I was really hoping

2616
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:47,980
it was going to land on Stevie.

2617
02:09:55,980 --> 02:09:57,980
Are you fucking kidding me?

2618
02:09:57,980 --> 02:09:59,980
Wait, me and him are alone.

2619
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:01,980
Daddy?

2620
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:03,980
Oh, okay.

2621
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:05,980
I'll sit in the chair for this.

2622
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:07,980
Stay.

2623
02:10:07,980 --> 02:10:09,980
We're watching you guys.

2624
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:11,980
It's a bench.

2625
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:13,980
Oh, God.

2626
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:15,980
We'll receive 1,000 coins.

2627
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:21,980
Holy fuck!

2628
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:23,980
What?

2629
02:10:23,980 --> 02:10:25,980
1,000 coins!

2630
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:27,980
No pecking way.

2631
02:10:27,980 --> 02:10:29,980
Did he just fucking rock?

2632
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:31,980
What happened here?

2633
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:33,980
What the fuck?

2634
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,980
I said I'm not giving you shit.

2635
02:10:35,980 --> 02:10:37,980
Wait, he didn't even give me 1,000 coins!

2636
02:10:37,980 --> 02:10:39,980
He said a fucking scam!

2637
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:41,980
What the heck?

2638
02:10:41,980 --> 02:10:43,980
He's like, don't mention it.

2639
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:45,980
Runs away.

2640
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:47,980
Daddy ain't sugaring right now.

2641
02:10:47,980 --> 02:10:49,980
Damn, I thought he was...

2642
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:51,980
Yeah, I thought he was going to blend you some sugar.

2643
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:53,980
Apparently not.

2644
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:55,980
Oh, no.

2645
02:10:55,980 --> 02:10:57,980
I'm so sad.

2646
02:10:57,980 --> 02:10:59,980
I thought you were going to get 1,000 coins!

2647
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:01,980
I thought so, too.

2648
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:03,980
I was so excited.

2649
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:05,980
This is not going to get me stars,

2650
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:07,980
but at least I'll have the most coins.

2651
02:11:07,980 --> 02:11:09,980
I'm so sad.

2652
02:11:09,980 --> 02:11:11,980
I'm so sad.

2653
02:11:11,980 --> 02:11:13,980
I'm so sorry that he just...

2654
02:11:13,980 --> 02:11:15,980
Oh, God.

2655
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:17,980
At least we're not going around again.

2656
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:19,980
Do a large.

2657
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:21,980
Just kidding. Don't do that.

2658
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:23,980
At this point, it's the last turn.

2659
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:25,980
Yeah.

2660
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:27,980
What if she spent her coins?

2661
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:29,980
Then she ends up in third.

2662
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:31,980
Mercy, why did you do that?

2663
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:33,980
I might just cry.

2664
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:35,980
Mercy, I told you not to!

2665
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:37,980
Oh, sorry. The voice is one.

2666
02:11:37,980 --> 02:11:39,980
The voice is one.

2667
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:41,980
No.

2668
02:11:41,980 --> 02:11:43,980
See, you would have been second.

2669
02:11:43,980 --> 02:11:45,980
Wait, what?

2670
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:47,980
It's okay. We have bonus coins.

2671
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:49,980
The voice in my head won.

2672
02:11:53,980 --> 02:11:55,980
I just wanted the big one.

2673
02:11:55,980 --> 02:11:57,980
It's very interesting.

2674
02:11:57,980 --> 02:11:59,980
Where is it going?

2675
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:01,980
I'm sorry. I'm stupid.

2676
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:07,980
I can't.

2677
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:09,980
What is this?

2678
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:11,980
What?

2679
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:13,980
Am I... Oh, I'm steering.

2680
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:15,980
I think.

2681
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:17,980
No, I think we're both steering.

2682
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:19,980
Does it even matter anymore?

2683
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:21,980
There's a shack.

2684
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:23,980
Swiggity-swooty.

2685
02:12:23,980 --> 02:12:25,980
Who's throwing stuff?

2686
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:27,980
The hammer guy is also still throwing stuff.

2687
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:29,980
I kind of get it.

2688
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:31,980
Yeah!

2689
02:12:31,980 --> 02:12:33,980
I think I got it.

2690
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:35,980
Kind of.

2691
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:37,980
Oh, my God. Let's roll.

2692
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:39,980
Sorry.

2693
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:41,980
You're good.

2694
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:45,980
There was such a gamer move,

2695
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:47,980
and then watch Mercy pull in first.

2696
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:49,980
Oh, my cat is...

2697
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:51,980
Where are we going?

2698
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:53,980
What?

2699
02:12:57,980 --> 02:12:59,980
Get the shack.

2700
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:01,980
You landed right on them.

2701
02:13:01,980 --> 02:13:03,980
I know.

2702
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:05,980
Oh, no.

2703
02:13:05,980 --> 02:13:07,980
Come on.

2704
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:09,980
We got to get it.

2705
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:11,980
We're going to get it.

2706
02:13:11,980 --> 02:13:13,980
No, I'm so sorry.

2707
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:15,980
It's me.

2708
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:17,980
We both steering.

2709
02:13:17,980 --> 02:13:19,980
I blame my cat.

2710
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:21,980
My cat, Fia, she distracted me.

2711
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:23,980
It's okay.

2712
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:25,980
I will...

2713
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:27,980
I will forgive.

2714
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:29,980
I'm sorry. She be cat debuff.

2715
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:31,980
Yeah.

2716
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,980
All right.

2717
02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:35,980
Now who will win at all?

2718
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:37,980
I can't talk.

2719
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:39,980
The first focus is...

2720
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:43,980
That is not me.

2721
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:45,980
I didn't have any.

2722
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:47,980
I think I'll be Mercy.

2723
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:49,980
Here.

2724
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:53,980
Did I get one for coming in fourth?

2725
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:57,980
I'm a star.

2726
02:13:57,980 --> 02:13:59,980
I love that movie.

2727
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:03,980
I still have yet to launch it.

2728
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:05,980
Oh, you passed you.

2729
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:07,980
I'm the slowpoke.

2730
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:09,980
Thanks.

2731
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,980
Hey, you can win.

2732
02:14:11,980 --> 02:14:13,980
I'm really going to be...

2733
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:15,980
Our final announcement.

2734
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:17,980
Nothing.

2735
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:19,980
And the winner is...

2736
02:14:25,980 --> 02:14:27,980
I got fatted.

2737
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:37,980
We saw that coming from like 20 miles away.

2738
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:41,980
I thought with the bonus stars, you would have a chance, but...

2739
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:43,980
I'm so sad.

2740
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:45,980
Yeah, the super star.

2741
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:47,980
I'm the winner.

2742
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:49,980
Oh, my God.

2743
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:51,980
The person who's never played before.

2744
02:14:51,980 --> 02:14:53,980
I'm not playing.

2745
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:55,980
It's Mercy being off the bed.

2746
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:57,980
You're not needed.

2747
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:07,980
Oh, Mercy.

2748
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:09,980
Can I come in fourth?

2749
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:11,980
Oh, Mercy.

2750
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:15,980
Mercy, why did you buy the plant?

2751
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:17,980
The voice is one.

2752
02:15:17,980 --> 02:15:19,980
This is Peach's map.

2753
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:21,980
She had it off already.

2754
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:27,980
Can you believe that effort?

2755
02:15:29,980 --> 02:15:31,980
You got a super.

2756
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:33,980
Thank you for the 10 super.

2757
02:15:33,980 --> 02:15:35,980
Okay, Kola, you're a winner in our hearts.

2758
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:37,980
Thank you.

2759
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:39,980
I love you. You did so well.

2760
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:41,980
Yeah.

2761
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:45,980
It's okay.

2762
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:47,980
That's all effort.

2763
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:53,980
In the arms of an angel.

2764
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:03,980
Oh, man.

2765
02:16:03,980 --> 02:16:05,980
If I had seven more coins, if only Bowser paid me...

2766
02:16:05,980 --> 02:16:07,980
I had so much fucking coins though.

2767
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:09,980
I had so much fucking coins though.

2768
02:16:09,980 --> 02:16:11,980
You would have won.

2769
02:16:11,980 --> 02:16:13,980
You got the thousand coins.

2770
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:15,980
Oh, my God.

2771
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:25,980
I came out of those coins.

2772
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:27,980
That was very fun.

2773
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:29,980
That was very fun.

2774
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:31,980
Yes indeed.

2775
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:33,980
That was fun.

2776
02:16:33,980 --> 02:16:35,980
Mario Party.

2777
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:37,980
Can I check?

2778
02:16:37,980 --> 02:16:39,980
I have to go.

2779
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:41,980
Yes, that is fine.

2780
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:43,980
Please go.

2781
02:16:43,980 --> 02:16:45,980
I leveled up in Mario Party.

2782
02:16:45,980 --> 02:16:47,980
I'm 23 now.

2783
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:49,980
This was so fun.

2784
02:16:49,980 --> 02:16:51,980
That was fun.

2785
02:16:51,980 --> 02:16:53,980
I would love to do this again.

2786
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:55,980
But drunk.

2787
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:57,980
That would be so funny.

2788
02:16:57,980 --> 02:16:59,980
I am so up for that.

2789
02:16:59,980 --> 02:17:01,980
I love you too, actually.

2790
02:17:01,980 --> 02:17:03,980
We'll plan that man next time.

2791
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:05,980
Hell yeah.

2792
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:07,980
Drunk Mario Kart.

2793
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:09,980
The rage quid eye driver.

2794
02:17:09,980 --> 02:17:11,980
The rage quid eye driver.

2795
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:13,980
The drunk driving.

2796
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:15,980
Don't do drunk driving, guys.

2797
02:17:15,980 --> 02:17:17,980
No, we're not endorsing that.

2798
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:19,980
No, not at all.

2799
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:21,980
Only in Mario Kart.

2800
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:23,980
Only in Minecraft.

2801
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:25,980
Only in Minecraft.

2802
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:27,980
Only in Minecraft.

2803
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:29,980
Thank you so much for joining us.

2804
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:31,980
Thank you so much.

2805
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:33,980
Thank you.

2806
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:35,980
Thank you so much.

2807
02:17:35,980 --> 02:17:37,980
See y'all later.

2808
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:39,980
Thanks for having us, Smithos girls.

2809
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:41,980
You guys were an absolute pleasure.

2810
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:43,980
Can't wait to hang out with you guys again.

2811
02:17:43,980 --> 02:17:45,980
Yes, for sure.

2812
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:47,980
Goodbye.

2813
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:49,980
Bye.

2814
02:17:53,980 --> 02:17:55,980
And now it's just us.

2815
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:57,980
Oh.

2816
02:17:57,980 --> 02:17:59,980
Do you want me to leave

2817
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:01,980
so you can talk to you?

2818
02:18:01,980 --> 02:18:03,980
I can't talk to them.

2819
02:18:03,980 --> 02:18:05,980
You can also talk to them if you want.

2820
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:07,980
Yay, I'll chat with them.

2821
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:09,980
Go to just chatting.

2822
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:11,980
Let me see if it works.

2823
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:13,980
Get rid of my Muppet.

2824
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:19,980
It should be gone.

2825
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:21,980
Yeah, now that we're in just chatting.

2826
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:23,980
Hold on.

2827
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:25,980
Now that we're in just chatting.

2828
02:18:25,980 --> 02:18:27,980
Woohoo.

2829
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:29,980
Let me just exit out of my gamey.

2830
02:18:35,980 --> 02:18:37,980
You're leaning back.

2831
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:39,980
That's all.

2832
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:41,980
No shibby audio?

2833
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:43,980
What the heck?

2834
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:45,980
Give me a second.

2835
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:47,980
There we go.

2836
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:49,980
I don't exist anymore.

2837
02:18:49,980 --> 02:18:51,980
Hi.

2838
02:18:51,980 --> 02:18:53,980
Hi.

2839
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:55,980
Can you hear her now?

2840
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:57,980
She's back.

2841
02:18:57,980 --> 02:18:59,980
She's back.

2842
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:01,980
Oh my gosh, your hair is so big.

2843
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:03,980
I'm so sorry.

2844
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:05,980
I meant to release.

2845
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:07,980
I'm taking off my limiter.

2846
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:15,980
Let me just...

2847
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:17,980
Yes.

2848
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:19,980
Do you want me to put it back on?

2849
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:21,980
I'll put it back on.

2850
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:23,980
Hold on, I got you.

2851
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:27,980
Mine.

2852
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:31,980
Mine.

2853
02:19:35,980 --> 02:19:37,980
Give me bunny ears.

2854
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:45,980
Oh my gosh, I have to put these back.

2855
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:47,980
My Joy-Con's back.

2856
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:49,980
Wait, I don't know if people...

2857
02:19:49,980 --> 02:19:51,980
Okay, they can't see it.

2858
02:19:51,980 --> 02:19:53,980
Wait, are you going to give me bunny ears?

2859
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:55,980
Yup.

2860
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:59,980
Oh dear.

2861
02:19:59,980 --> 02:20:01,980
Hoins.

2862
02:20:01,980 --> 02:20:03,980
They're technically devil hordes.

2863
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:05,980
That's the way you get it.

2864
02:20:05,980 --> 02:20:07,980
Let me throw my hands away.

2865
02:20:07,980 --> 02:20:09,980
Let me put my...

2866
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:13,980
Perfect.

2867
02:20:13,980 --> 02:20:15,980
This will work out.

2868
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:17,980
Let me...

2869
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:19,980
Oh fuck.

2870
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:21,980
Now I was gone.

2871
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:25,980
I'm trying to bring myself lower,

2872
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:27,980
but it's not working.

2873
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:29,980
It's okay.

2874
02:20:29,980 --> 02:20:31,980
I locked my model, there we go.

2875
02:20:31,980 --> 02:20:33,980
Hi.

2876
02:20:35,980 --> 02:20:37,980
I should be like lower,

2877
02:20:37,980 --> 02:20:39,980
because I'm shorter.

2878
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:41,980
Let me move myself up.

2879
02:20:45,980 --> 02:20:47,980
I'm getting cozy.

2880
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:49,980
My scissors are too big.

2881
02:20:49,980 --> 02:20:51,980
My scissors are too big.

2882
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:55,980
My hair is coming out from underneath the blanket.

2883
02:20:55,980 --> 02:20:57,980
Okay, I'll join you in blanket-ness.

2884
02:21:01,980 --> 02:21:03,980
Yeah, are we gonna...

2885
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:05,980
I feel like we're having a sleepover.

2886
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:07,980
Should we tell stories?

2887
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:09,980
Oh yeah, we should tell stories.

2888
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:11,980
Oh my gosh, I had so much fun with the...

2889
02:21:11,980 --> 02:21:13,980
There we go.

2890
02:21:13,980 --> 02:21:15,980
We look so cute.

2891
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:17,980
Oh my gosh.

2892
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:19,980
I like how your scissors are poking out.

2893
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:23,980
Probably gonna be poking out.

2894
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:27,980
Hanging out with Mythos was so fun.

2895
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:29,980
I know, right? I'm so glad they invited us

2896
02:21:29,980 --> 02:21:31,980
for a collab.

2897
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:33,980
That was really fun, even though I like lost so many times.

2898
02:21:35,980 --> 02:21:37,980
Hey, I came in...

2899
02:21:37,980 --> 02:21:39,980
Oh wait, no, you came in fourth.

2900
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:41,980
You forget about my last...

2901
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:43,980
The last second...

2902
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:45,980
Oh, we only had it five.

2903
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:49,980
I'm playing.

2904
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:51,980
I'm laughing so hard my cheeks hurt.

2905
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:53,980
Oh my god.

2906
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:55,980
Yes, they're all very cute girls.

2907
02:21:55,980 --> 02:21:57,980
Those girls are really fun, yeah.

2908
02:21:57,980 --> 02:21:59,980
They're right up our alley too.

2909
02:21:59,980 --> 02:22:01,980
We have such similar personalities.

2910
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:03,980
They have the same jokes.

2911
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:05,980
Yeah, I'm like...

2912
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:07,980
I feel like...

2913
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:09,980
I feel like if we were ever

2914
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:11,980
in a company together, it would just make sense.

2915
02:22:11,980 --> 02:22:13,980
I honestly said

2916
02:22:13,980 --> 02:22:15,980
they would fit in via law.

2917
02:22:15,980 --> 02:22:17,980
I think they suit Mythos

2918
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:19,980
also very well. Oh yeah, 100%.

2919
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:21,980
What?

2920
02:22:21,980 --> 02:22:23,980
I just want to steal them for a second, Jen.

2921
02:22:23,980 --> 02:22:25,980
My eyebrows?

2922
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,980
Yeah, what is happening there?

2923
02:22:27,980 --> 02:22:29,980
What's going on?

2924
02:22:29,980 --> 02:22:31,980
It's wiggling.

2925
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:33,980
Then you blink.

2926
02:22:35,980 --> 02:22:37,980
That's so weird.

2927
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:39,980
I realize me and you haven't collabed one-on-one.

2928
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:41,980
Oh yeah, we haven't.

2929
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:43,980
Yeah, I've only done it with Azura.

2930
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:45,980
I have to make sure I collab

2931
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:47,980
with my own gen mates one-on-one.

2932
02:22:47,980 --> 02:22:49,980
I don't think I've actually

2933
02:22:49,980 --> 02:22:51,980
collabed with any of my gen mates

2934
02:22:51,980 --> 02:22:53,980
except for Strani

2935
02:22:53,980 --> 02:22:55,980
because that was one of the earlier ones.

2936
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:57,980
Yeah, and I did Azura.

2937
02:22:59,980 --> 02:23:01,980
What game?

2938
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:03,980
We played Fall Guys.

2939
02:23:03,980 --> 02:23:05,980
What would you guys want to watch

2940
02:23:05,980 --> 02:23:07,980
me and

2941
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:09,980
Mercy play?

2942
02:23:09,980 --> 02:23:11,980
Bye Poseidon, it was so fun playing.

2943
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:13,980
Poseidon, hold on.

2944
02:23:13,980 --> 02:23:15,980
Give her the hot girl wrench.

2945
02:23:15,980 --> 02:23:17,980
How can I give her the hot girl wrench?

2946
02:23:17,980 --> 02:23:19,980
Why am I bad at this?

2947
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:21,980
Three dots and then make more.

2948
02:23:21,980 --> 02:23:23,980
I can't do it.

2949
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:25,980
Hold on, let me do it.

2950
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:27,980
I'm a standard moderator.

2951
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:29,980
I'm so bad at this.

2952
02:23:29,980 --> 02:23:31,980
I went in and added

2953
02:23:31,980 --> 02:23:33,980
like the VNU girls.

2954
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:37,980
Manually.

2955
02:23:37,980 --> 02:23:39,980
I did too.

2956
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:41,980
For some of the girls.

2957
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:43,980
Add as moderator.

2958
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:45,980
Standard moderator.

2959
02:23:45,980 --> 02:23:47,980
Get wrenched, get wrenched, get wrenched, get wrenched.

2960
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:49,980
Hot girls get wrenched.

2961
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:55,980
Either of you played a way out,

2962
02:23:55,980 --> 02:23:57,980
I have played a way out.

2963
02:23:57,980 --> 02:23:59,980
Like long, long, long ago.

2964
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:01,980
Atix too would probably make her motion sick

2965
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:03,980
because it's made me motion sick before.

2966
02:24:03,980 --> 02:24:05,980
I played that too, but

2967
02:24:05,980 --> 02:24:07,980
very slowly because of my motion sickness.

2968
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:09,980
Yeah.

2969
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:11,980
I call a puzzle bang.

2970
02:24:11,980 --> 02:24:13,980
Puzzle bang? Excuse me?

2971
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:15,980
Puzzle what?

2972
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:17,980
Puzzle game would be good too

2973
02:24:17,980 --> 02:24:19,980
is what I was going to say.

2974
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:23,980
I was like bang.

2975
02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:25,980
Sorry Freudian slip. Thank you so much Minish for the 10.

2976
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:27,980
Poggers?

2977
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:29,980
Poggers.

2978
02:24:29,980 --> 02:24:31,980
Gifted 10.

2979
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:33,980
Absolute beast.

2980
02:24:33,980 --> 02:24:35,980
Let's go. Thank you.

2981
02:24:35,980 --> 02:24:37,980
Go off.

2982
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:41,980
Puzzle bang. I'm terrible at puzzles.

2983
02:24:41,980 --> 02:24:43,980
Porto too would make me cry as well.

2984
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:47,980
Poseidon cost night.

2985
02:24:47,980 --> 02:24:49,980
Poseidon.

2986
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:53,980
She got gifted a membership.

2987
02:24:53,980 --> 02:24:55,980
Let's go.

2988
02:24:55,980 --> 02:24:57,980
What the heck Poseidon?

2989
02:24:57,980 --> 02:24:59,980
You're so lucky.

2990
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:01,980
Senpai.

2991
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:03,980
You get

2992
02:25:03,980 --> 02:25:05,980
the hot girl ring.

2993
02:25:05,980 --> 02:25:07,980
You got a standing member.

2994
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:09,980
A tear.

2995
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:11,980
Senpai.

2996
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:13,980
I'll let you vote.

2997
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:15,980
Thank you Yon.

2998
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:17,980
I'm Epi.

2999
02:25:17,980 --> 02:25:19,980
Yeah Epi.

3000
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:21,980
Senpai.

3001
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:23,980
It's a little bit Epi.

3002
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,980
It's a game that we both just be

3003
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:27,980
adorably failure at.

3004
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:29,980
That's every game.

3005
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:31,980
That's a good point.

3006
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:33,980
That's every game for me.

3007
02:25:33,980 --> 02:25:35,980
The bomb diffusing game.

3008
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:37,980
I can't read.

3009
02:25:37,980 --> 02:25:39,980
I keep talking and nobody explodes to be hilarious.

3010
02:25:39,980 --> 02:25:41,980
I can't read.

3011
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:43,980
Cuphead?

3012
02:25:43,980 --> 02:25:45,980
We would both be raging so hard if we played Cuphead.

3013
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:47,980
I think Cuphead we would cry.

3014
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:49,980
Yeah.

3015
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:51,980
Simulator?

3016
02:25:51,980 --> 02:25:53,980
We have to finish a campaign first.

3017
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:55,980
Yeah.

3018
02:25:55,980 --> 02:25:57,980
I have to do that.

3019
02:25:57,980 --> 02:25:59,980
Bye Poseidon.

3020
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:01,980
Thank you for joining us.

3021
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:03,980
Thank you for the invite.

3022
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:05,980
I love you.

3023
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:07,980
We would be stuck on the same level

3024
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:09,980
for like

3025
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:11,980
three hours.

3026
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:13,980
That's so true.

3027
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:15,980
I never beat Cuphead.

3028
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:17,980
I think I got all the way to Marina

3029
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:19,980
or whatever the octopus lady was

3030
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:21,980
and I just gave up.

3031
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:23,980
I love

3032
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:25,980
the octopus lady.

3033
02:26:25,980 --> 02:26:27,980
She looks pretty.

3034
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:29,980
Yeah. I love the designs of the bosses

3035
02:26:29,980 --> 02:26:31,980
in the game are really cool.

3036
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:33,980
Super Bunny Man.

3037
02:26:33,980 --> 02:26:35,980
Yes.

3038
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:37,980
I played Super Bunny Man

3039
02:26:37,980 --> 02:26:39,980
with Toma.

3040
02:26:39,980 --> 02:26:41,980
It's so funny.

3041
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:43,980
It's like little platforming.

3042
02:26:43,980 --> 02:26:45,980
You just have to clear levels

3043
02:26:45,980 --> 02:26:47,980
but there's like really funny physics

3044
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:49,980
and we have to like grab each other

3045
02:26:49,980 --> 02:26:51,980
and like flip each other

3046
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:53,980
and we got to like jump over stuff

3047
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:55,980
but it's not, it's only a side scroller

3048
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:57,980
so you shouldn't get motion sick.

3049
02:26:57,980 --> 02:26:59,980
Okay. I'm down for that one.

3050
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:01,980
Okay. We are making this happen

3051
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:03,980
because I love Super Bunny Man.

3052
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:05,980
I think that would be really fun. Let's do it.

3053
02:27:05,980 --> 02:27:07,980
And I'm a bunny.

3054
02:27:07,980 --> 02:27:09,980
Pan it out.

3055
02:27:09,980 --> 02:27:11,980
Pan it out Bunny Burl.

3056
02:27:11,980 --> 02:27:13,980
I was going to say Bunny Burl.

3057
02:27:13,980 --> 02:27:15,980
Bunny Burl.

3058
02:27:15,980 --> 02:27:17,980
I still need to do my schedule for next week.

3059
02:27:19,980 --> 02:27:21,980
Hold on. Let me check my schedule for next week.

3060
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:23,980
I don't think I've...

3061
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:25,980
I haven't done anything.

3062
02:27:25,980 --> 02:27:27,980
I'm going to type in my schedule right now.

3063
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:29,980
I don't think I've set it up but yes

3064
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:31,980
if you set it up for next week

3065
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:33,980
I can definitely

3066
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:35,980
match it.

3067
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:37,980
Match it. Yes.

3068
02:27:37,980 --> 02:27:39,980
I can do something.

3069
02:27:39,980 --> 02:27:41,980
I'm just going to ask for it.

3070
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:43,980
Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?

3071
02:27:43,980 --> 02:27:45,980
I prefer Monday or Tuesday.

3072
02:27:45,980 --> 02:27:47,980
What time would you like, my dear?

3073
02:27:47,980 --> 02:27:49,980
I prefer the evenings

3074
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:51,980
but whatever time works for you.

3075
02:27:51,980 --> 02:27:53,980
Do you want to do Tuesday?

3076
02:27:53,980 --> 02:27:55,980
I can do Tuesday.

3077
02:27:55,980 --> 02:27:57,980
The 16th?

3078
02:27:57,980 --> 02:27:59,980
Yeah. 16th sounds good.

3079
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:01,980
Okay. I'm adding that right now.

3080
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:03,980
What time?

3081
02:28:03,980 --> 02:28:05,980
What time did you say?

3082
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:07,980
I said 8.

3083
02:28:07,980 --> 02:28:09,980
She wants to do

3084
02:28:09,980 --> 02:28:11,980
8pm

3085
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:13,980
Eastern time.

3086
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:15,980
Okay.

3087
02:28:15,980 --> 02:28:17,980
Okay.

3088
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:19,980
Okay.

3089
02:28:19,980 --> 02:28:21,980
Maybe we should do 9pm

3090
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,980
so we don't overlap.

3091
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:25,980
She didn't

3092
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:27,980
schedule anything there.

3093
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:29,980
I'm going to do it then.

3094
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:31,980
My gosh, Tomas in chat.

3095
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:33,980
Hi, Tomas!

3096
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:35,980
Hold on. Let me watch the Tomas.

3097
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:37,980
Tomas,

3098
02:28:37,980 --> 02:28:39,980
everybody liked Muppet Chibi.

3099
02:28:39,980 --> 02:28:41,980
Thank you. I love Muppet Chibi.

3100
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:45,980
Chibi Mercy.

3101
02:28:45,980 --> 02:28:47,980
Get wrenched. Get your wrenched.

3102
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:49,980
Get wrenched.

3103
02:28:49,980 --> 02:28:51,980
Get drenched?

3104
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:53,980
I mean, wrenched.

3105
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:55,980
Super...

3106
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:57,980
collab

3107
02:28:57,980 --> 02:28:59,980
super bunny man.

3108
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:01,980
Yeah, look at us.

3109
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:03,980
We're planning some

3110
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:05,980
shit.

3111
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:07,980
Shit.

3112
02:29:11,980 --> 02:29:13,980
I have a...

3113
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:15,980
I think I'm going to...

3114
02:29:15,980 --> 02:29:17,980
Yeah, I'm going to make my schedule.

3115
02:29:17,980 --> 02:29:19,980
My hair is mostly in the chat so it's fine. I can talk.

3116
02:29:19,980 --> 02:29:21,980
Yeah.

3117
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:23,980
I think I'm going to do member streams on Mondays.

3118
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:25,980
I can call them member Mondays.

3119
02:29:25,980 --> 02:29:27,980
That's really good. I usually choose

3120
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:29,980
my members to be on Fridays.

3121
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:31,980
Ooh.

3122
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:33,980
Good for the weekends, hanging out.

3123
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:35,980
Yeah, good for the weekend. They are relaxed.

3124
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:37,980
Maybe they're chill.

3125
02:29:37,980 --> 02:29:39,980
If they go party and stuff,

3126
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:41,980
maybe they come home and be like,

3127
02:29:41,980 --> 02:29:43,980
I want to just...

3128
02:29:47,980 --> 02:29:49,980
I want to just...

3129
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:51,980
I can't even make that noise.

3130
02:29:53,980 --> 02:29:55,980
When does Emmy get back? She gets back today!

3131
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:57,980
Emmy's back!

3132
02:29:57,980 --> 02:29:59,980
Whoa!

3133
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:01,980
Yeah, Emmy's back!

3134
02:30:01,980 --> 02:30:03,980
I missed my little sister.

3135
02:30:03,980 --> 02:30:05,980
I missed my little Amutha.

3136
02:30:05,980 --> 02:30:07,980
We miss her so much.

3137
02:30:07,980 --> 02:30:09,980
I love her.

3138
02:30:09,980 --> 02:30:11,980
She's got some good stuff

3139
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:13,980
on her schedule coming up.

3140
02:30:15,980 --> 02:30:17,980
Don't say anything. It's a surprise.

3141
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:19,980
Sorry, I wanted to see what she was planning.

3142
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:25,980
At least I think. I miss high beat up for her.

3143
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:27,980
Yeah, I miss her.

3144
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:29,980
We need to collab with her again.

3145
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:31,980
That was fun.

3146
02:30:31,980 --> 02:30:33,980
Us three and Azura.

3147
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:35,980
I want to have a collab with everyone.

3148
02:30:35,980 --> 02:30:37,980
Well, we have a collab soon!

3149
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:39,980
Yeah, the rating thing!

3150
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:41,980
Yeah, are you able to make

3151
02:30:41,980 --> 02:30:43,980
also the You May Plus watch along?

3152
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:45,980
Yeah, I think so. It's in the evening.

3153
02:30:45,980 --> 02:30:47,980
Wait, what time is that?

3154
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:49,980
Because that's on the...

3155
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:53,980
That's in the evening.

3156
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:55,980
Yeah, it's Sunday.

3157
02:30:55,980 --> 02:30:57,980
That's right.

3158
02:30:59,980 --> 02:31:01,980
You May Plus is having a concert.

3159
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:03,980
We're just working out our schedules right now.

3160
02:31:03,980 --> 02:31:05,980
You May Plus has a concert.

3161
02:31:05,980 --> 02:31:07,980
I'm looking forward to it.

3162
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:09,980
I think all the girls work really hard on it.

3163
02:31:09,980 --> 02:31:11,980
Everyone watches.

3164
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:13,980
Or you can watch along with me, you know?

3165
02:31:13,980 --> 02:31:15,980
Yeah!

3166
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:17,980
Excite.

3167
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:19,980
For our member stream on Monday,

3168
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,980
we're watching Twilight, no questions asked.

3169
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:23,980
Don't fight me on this.

3170
02:31:23,980 --> 02:31:25,980
I love sparkly vampires.

3171
02:31:25,980 --> 02:31:27,980
I want a sparkle.

3172
02:31:27,980 --> 02:31:29,980
I wish we could gift

3173
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:31,980
membership to each other.

3174
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:33,980
Right?

3175
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:35,980
So that we can watch each other's member streams.

3176
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:37,980
Because I would love to watch some of your guys' member streams.

3177
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:39,980
I wanted to watch Transformers

3178
02:31:39,980 --> 02:31:41,980
with...

3179
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:43,980
Ronnie.

3180
02:31:43,980 --> 02:31:45,980
I'm watching Eagle Eye.

3181
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:47,980
Eagle Eye? That's good.

3182
02:31:47,980 --> 02:31:49,980
See, I would want to watch that.

3183
02:31:49,980 --> 02:31:51,980
Eagle Eye is what made me into an entertainer.

3184
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:53,980
It's my awakening

3185
02:31:53,980 --> 02:31:55,980
to acting and stuff.

3186
02:31:55,980 --> 02:31:57,980
Is that with Tom Cruise?

3187
02:31:57,980 --> 02:31:59,980
It's the one with Shia LaBeouf.

3188
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:01,980
Oh!

3189
02:32:01,980 --> 02:32:03,980
Wait.

3190
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:05,980
Shia LaBeouf.

3191
02:32:05,980 --> 02:32:07,980
Shia LaBeouf.

3192
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:09,980
Eagle.

3193
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:11,980
I think I'm thinking of another movie with Tom Cruise.

3194
02:32:13,980 --> 02:32:15,980
I mean, Twilight's good.

3195
02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:17,980
Actually, there's a whole study on Twilight.

3196
02:32:17,980 --> 02:32:19,980
Which is really interesting.

3197
02:32:19,980 --> 02:32:21,980
Have I seen Eagle Eye?

3198
02:32:21,980 --> 02:32:23,980
Have you?

3199
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:25,980
It's just showing me pictures of Eagle's eyes.

3200
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:27,980
No, Eagle Eye like me.

3201
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:29,980
I know.

3202
02:32:29,980 --> 02:32:31,980
Shia LaBeouf.

3203
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:33,980
I see the poster,

3204
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:35,980
but there's also just a bunch of Eagle Eyes,

3205
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:37,980
and it's funny.

3206
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:39,980
That's what happens.

3207
02:32:39,980 --> 02:32:41,980
Twilight, watch along.

3208
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:43,980
Actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf.

3209
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:45,980
Shia LaBeouf.

3210
02:32:45,980 --> 02:32:47,980
Shia LaBeouf.

3211
02:32:47,980 --> 02:32:49,980
You're walking in the woods.

3212
02:32:49,980 --> 02:32:51,980
Shia LaBeouf.

3213
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:53,980
Shia LaBeouf.

3214
02:32:53,980 --> 02:32:55,980
I can't wait to

3215
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:57,980
shit on the Twilight movie.

3216
02:32:57,980 --> 02:32:59,980
I love the Twilight movie because it's so bad.

3217
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:01,980
I kind of like Twilight.

3218
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:03,980
In general, overall.

3219
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:05,980
Did you?

3220
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:07,980
I'm not like a Twilight hater.

3221
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:09,980
I don't hate.

3222
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:11,980
I just...

3223
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:13,980
I don't hate hate.

3224
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:15,980
I don't know how to explain it.

3225
02:33:15,980 --> 02:33:17,980
Overall, I'm just like,

3226
02:33:17,980 --> 02:33:19,980
oh, it's charming in its own way.

3227
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:21,980
Yeah, I like to make fun of some

3228
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:23,980
of the movies.

3229
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:25,980
The books are definitely better.

3230
02:33:27,980 --> 02:33:29,980
It's some good cringe.

3231
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:31,980
Exactly.

3232
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:33,980
I'm Jacob because I like wolves.

3233
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:35,980
I think I liked...

3234
02:33:35,980 --> 02:33:37,980
I had like a head canon ship.

3235
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:39,980
Like, in my head

3236
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:41,980
with like Alice and Bella instead.

3237
02:33:41,980 --> 02:33:43,980
Really?

3238
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:45,980
I also really liked

3239
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:47,980
Jasper.

3240
02:33:47,980 --> 02:33:49,980
But then I found out he was a Confederate soldier

3241
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:51,980
and it just didn't work out.

3242
02:33:55,980 --> 02:33:57,980
What does he say?

3243
02:33:57,980 --> 02:33:59,980
I forgot that stupid line he says.

3244
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:03,980
Jasper

3245
02:34:03,980 --> 02:34:05,980
Twilight

3246
02:34:05,980 --> 02:34:07,980
quote.

3247
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:09,980
He said something really stupid.

3248
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:11,980
I was

3249
02:34:11,980 --> 02:34:13,980
I was just like, yeah, I like Alice.

3250
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:17,980
Alice is so... I had a big crush on Alice.

3251
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,980
Alice was like...

3252
02:34:19,980 --> 02:34:21,980
And then I was like, Alice, please

3253
02:34:21,980 --> 02:34:23,980
get together with Bella.

3254
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:25,980
You two would escape

3255
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:27,980
these two weirdos.

3256
02:34:27,980 --> 02:34:29,980
I totally get the head canon.

3257
02:34:29,980 --> 02:34:31,980
All right.

3258
02:34:31,980 --> 02:34:33,980
Emmett was so...

3259
02:34:33,980 --> 02:34:35,980
Emmett was such a dude bro to me.

3260
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:37,980
And I was like, yeah, I like Emmett.

3261
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:39,980
And I was like, play football with him.

3262
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:43,980
Alice was the girls girls.

3263
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:45,980
She was. She was for the girlies.

3264
02:34:45,980 --> 02:34:47,980
Yeah, she was for the girlies.

3265
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:49,980
I thought it was fun.

3266
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:51,980
I don't remember most of it though.

3267
02:34:51,980 --> 02:34:53,980
I remember being in a book club that read it.

3268
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:55,980
Because I just was like

3269
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:57,980
I need something to do.

3270
02:34:57,980 --> 02:34:59,980
And so I joined a book club

3271
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:01,980
and they were reading Twilight.

3272
02:35:01,980 --> 02:35:03,980
Oh, Nifty.

3273
02:35:03,980 --> 02:35:05,980
I feel like that's definitely a fun book to read

3274
02:35:05,980 --> 02:35:07,980
with other people because then you can just like geek out over it.

3275
02:35:07,980 --> 02:35:09,980
That's what happened in the past.

3276
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:13,980
Alice, ex Bella had so many fanfics

3277
02:35:13,980 --> 02:35:15,980
and they were right.

3278
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:17,980
I think the only

3279
02:35:17,980 --> 02:35:19,980
series that I like

3280
02:35:19,980 --> 02:35:21,980
make fun of

3281
02:35:21,980 --> 02:35:23,980
because it's the Twilight fanfiction

3282
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:25,980
is like 50 Shades of Grey.

3283
02:35:25,980 --> 02:35:27,980
Yeah.

3284
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:29,980
50 Shades of Grey is a Twilight fanfiction.

3285
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:31,980
It's so funny.

3286
02:35:31,980 --> 02:35:33,980
It's so funny.

3287
02:35:33,980 --> 02:35:35,980
They just changed the names.

3288
02:35:35,980 --> 02:35:37,980
But I read all of it

3289
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:39,980
and it was not great.

3290
02:35:43,980 --> 02:35:45,980
It was not great

3291
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:47,980
because there was a point where I had to

3292
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:49,980
go back and read a few pages

3293
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:51,980
because he was like

3294
02:35:51,980 --> 02:35:53,980
behind me.

3295
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:55,980
And then I was like

3296
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:57,980
and then he was

3297
02:35:57,980 --> 02:35:59,980
my hands were against the wall

3298
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:01,980
and then now he's appearing in front of me

3299
02:36:01,980 --> 02:36:03,980
and I was like, wait, is he behind you?

3300
02:36:03,980 --> 02:36:05,980
How do you like appear in front of you?

3301
02:36:07,980 --> 02:36:09,980
I go under your arms.

3302
02:36:09,980 --> 02:36:11,980
What the heck happened?

3303
02:36:17,980 --> 02:36:19,980
I literally was like, wait.

3304
02:36:19,980 --> 02:36:21,980
Wait a second.

3305
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:25,980
If you're against the wall

3306
02:36:25,980 --> 02:36:27,980
then how did he just go

3307
02:36:27,980 --> 02:36:29,980
right underneath?

3308
02:36:29,980 --> 02:36:31,980
Yeah, I don't

3309
02:36:31,980 --> 02:36:33,980
question it anymore.

3310
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:35,980
Okay, I'm getting lost.

3311
02:36:37,980 --> 02:36:39,980
I'm getting lost

3312
02:36:39,980 --> 02:36:41,980
and I think what

3313
02:36:41,980 --> 02:36:43,980
I kept on cracking up

3314
02:36:43,980 --> 02:36:45,980
at my inner goddess.

3315
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:53,980
Take a drink

3316
02:36:53,980 --> 02:36:55,980
every time she says like inner goddess.

3317
02:36:55,980 --> 02:36:57,980
Oh my god.

3318
02:36:57,980 --> 02:36:59,980
You won't make it.

3319
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:01,980
I wish you'd do 50 shades and watch the log.

3320
02:37:05,980 --> 02:37:07,980
This book is enough to speak to your inner goddess.

3321
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:09,980
I don't even know where my inner goddess is.

3322
02:37:11,980 --> 02:37:13,980
Just steps of crack.

3323
02:37:17,980 --> 02:37:19,980
It was funny.

3324
02:37:19,980 --> 02:37:21,980
I still have it somewhere.

3325
02:37:21,980 --> 02:37:23,980
I think my friend gave it to me as a joke.

3326
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:25,980
Oh my god.

3327
02:37:25,980 --> 02:37:27,980
He's a porn

3328
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:29,980
for

3329
02:37:29,980 --> 02:37:31,980
your birthday

3330
02:37:31,980 --> 02:37:33,980
and I was like,

3331
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:35,980
thanks.

3332
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:37,980
I remember being

3333
02:37:37,980 --> 02:37:39,980
10 or something.

3334
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:41,980
I don't even know.

3335
02:37:41,980 --> 02:37:43,980
I was at the pool with some kids

3336
02:37:43,980 --> 02:37:45,980
from school because we were on a field trip

3337
02:37:45,980 --> 02:37:47,980
and we were all talking about books.

3338
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:49,980
I thought I was being cool

3339
02:37:49,980 --> 02:37:51,980
because I was just like

3340
02:37:51,980 --> 02:37:53,980
I just heard a lot of people were reading 50 shades

3341
02:37:53,980 --> 02:37:55,980
without knowing what it was.

3342
02:37:55,980 --> 02:37:57,980
I was reading 50 shades.

3343
02:37:57,980 --> 02:37:59,980
It's pretty up there

3344
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:01,980
book.

3345
02:38:01,980 --> 02:38:03,980
I was trying to flex on these kids

3346
02:38:03,980 --> 02:38:05,980
that I was reading 50 shades and one of the

3347
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:07,980
school counselors came by

3348
02:38:07,980 --> 02:38:09,980
and pulled me aside.

3349
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:11,980
They had it called

3350
02:38:11,980 --> 02:38:13,980
my parents because

3351
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:15,980
my parents was letting me read 50 shades.

3352
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:17,980
I was very awkward

3353
02:38:17,980 --> 02:38:19,980
and I was just like

3354
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:21,980
I'm sorry.

3355
02:38:21,980 --> 02:38:23,980
I was just trying to be cool.

3356
02:38:23,980 --> 02:38:25,980
You were trying to be cool.

3357
02:38:25,980 --> 02:38:27,980
You just lied.

3358
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:29,980
They were confused because

3359
02:38:29,980 --> 02:38:31,980
again, I grew up in a very religious household

3360
02:38:31,980 --> 02:38:33,980
because they're like, why is this Christian girl

3361
02:38:33,980 --> 02:38:35,980
telling everybody

3362
02:38:35,980 --> 02:38:37,980
to read 50 shades?

3363
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:41,980
I think

3364
02:38:41,980 --> 02:38:43,980
it's fair though

3365
02:38:43,980 --> 02:38:45,980
the amount of

3366
02:38:45,980 --> 02:38:47,980
publicity

3367
02:38:47,980 --> 02:38:49,980
that book made, you'd be like

3368
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:51,980
it's probably a good book, right?

3369
02:38:51,980 --> 02:38:53,980
It was the first popularized

3370
02:38:53,980 --> 02:38:55,980
smut book.

3371
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:57,980
Everybody else just kept that stuff

3372
02:38:57,980 --> 02:38:59,980
behind closed doors.

3373
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:01,980
You never heard about anything.

3374
02:39:01,980 --> 02:39:03,980
I remember

3375
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:05,980
seeing on Tumblr

3376
02:39:05,980 --> 02:39:07,980
people were like, oh my gosh, I'm so in love

3377
02:39:07,980 --> 02:39:09,980
with this.

3378
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:11,980
It was all the fucking screen caps from the movie.

3379
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:13,980
I was like, oh, is it good?

3380
02:39:13,980 --> 02:39:15,980
And then I went to read it and I was like

3381
02:39:19,980 --> 02:39:21,980
This is something

3382
02:39:21,980 --> 02:39:23,980
I think I did end up

3383
02:39:23,980 --> 02:39:25,980
reading it later in life, like actually reading

3384
02:39:25,980 --> 02:39:27,980
the book and it's so bad.

3385
02:39:29,980 --> 02:39:31,980
It really wasn't edited.

3386
02:39:31,980 --> 02:39:33,980
It really wasn't edited.

3387
02:39:33,980 --> 02:39:35,980
I was like, okay, wait, is this a spelling error?

3388
02:39:35,980 --> 02:39:37,980
Now we get

3389
02:39:37,980 --> 02:39:39,980
some better.

3390
02:39:39,980 --> 02:39:41,980
I haven't read a good romance book in a while.

3391
02:39:41,980 --> 02:39:43,980
I'll read some trash.

3392
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:45,980
I read Aqatar, a.k.a.

3393
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:47,980
Court of Thorn and Roses.

3394
02:39:47,980 --> 02:39:49,980
It's not good, but it's engaging.

3395
02:39:49,980 --> 02:39:51,980
I think the last

3396
02:39:51,980 --> 02:39:53,980
book I read was like, gosh,

3397
02:39:53,980 --> 02:39:55,980
I've been reading classical literature.

3398
02:39:55,980 --> 02:39:57,980
Oh, nice.

3399
02:39:57,980 --> 02:39:59,980
The last book I read

3400
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:01,980
that I can remember

3401
02:40:01,980 --> 02:40:03,980
reading was

3402
02:40:03,980 --> 02:40:05,980
The Robot Series

3403
02:40:05,980 --> 02:40:07,980
by Isaac Asimov.

3404
02:40:07,980 --> 02:40:09,980
Oh, that's a good series.

3405
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:11,980
That's on my list.

3406
02:40:11,980 --> 02:40:13,980
100%.

3407
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:15,980
I wanted to read some Asimov stuff.

3408
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:17,980
The most recent book I've read

3409
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:19,980
is The Atlas Six

3410
02:40:19,980 --> 02:40:21,980
by Olivier

3411
02:40:21,980 --> 02:40:23,980
something. I forget what their name is.

3412
02:40:23,980 --> 02:40:25,980
It's very good.

3413
02:40:25,980 --> 02:40:27,980
I love

3414
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:29,980
fiction with a dash of fantasy

3415
02:40:29,980 --> 02:40:31,980
or what takes place

3416
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:33,980
in the real world.

3417
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:35,980
The Club of Mercy and Sheevee.

3418
02:40:35,980 --> 02:40:37,980
I'm going to do something like that,

3419
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:39,980
but we all read smut books.

3420
02:40:39,980 --> 02:40:41,980
I'm working on that behind the scenes.

3421
02:40:41,980 --> 02:40:43,980
Don't tell nobody.

3422
02:40:43,980 --> 02:40:45,980
It's okay. I actually have a few books

3423
02:40:45,980 --> 02:40:47,980
that I'm just like, yeah,

3424
02:40:47,980 --> 02:40:49,980
if we can read free books,

3425
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:51,980
you know,

3426
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:53,980
public domain books, that would be cool.

3427
02:40:53,980 --> 02:40:55,980
Like, Moby Dick

3428
02:40:55,980 --> 02:40:57,980
or

3429
02:40:57,980 --> 02:40:59,980
You want to read Moby Dick?

3430
02:40:59,980 --> 02:41:01,980
I do love Dory and Gray

3431
02:41:01,980 --> 02:41:03,980
as one of my favorite classic books.

3432
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:05,980
That was, I was like, oh my gosh,

3433
02:41:05,980 --> 02:41:07,980
I feel like I'm reading a fanfiction.

3434
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:09,980
It was so

3435
02:41:09,980 --> 02:41:11,980
homoerotic. I think that's why I liked it.

3436
02:41:11,980 --> 02:41:13,980
Right?

3437
02:41:13,980 --> 02:41:15,980
I'm like, oh, the attention

3438
02:41:15,980 --> 02:41:17,980
is becoming basal.

3439
02:41:17,980 --> 02:41:19,980
I was Pujo Mines going

3440
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:21,980
literally.

3441
02:41:21,980 --> 02:41:23,980
Invisible Man was good.

3442
02:41:23,980 --> 02:41:25,980
I think

3443
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:27,980
yeah, I also have,

3444
02:41:27,980 --> 02:41:29,980
I was in the middle of reading.

3445
02:41:29,980 --> 02:41:31,980
Oh shit, what was I reading?

3446
02:41:31,980 --> 02:41:33,980
Maybe you should watch a

3447
02:41:33,980 --> 02:41:35,980
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

3448
02:41:37,980 --> 02:41:39,980
Have you ever seen that movie?

3449
02:41:39,980 --> 02:41:41,980
No, no, I haven't.

3450
02:41:41,980 --> 02:41:43,980
It's literally, imagine

3451
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:45,980
an action movie,

3452
02:41:45,980 --> 02:41:47,980
but all of your classic literature characters,

3453
02:41:47,980 --> 02:41:49,980
like

3454
02:41:49,980 --> 02:41:51,980
Huckleberry Finn, The Invisible Man

3455
02:41:51,980 --> 02:41:53,980
Helping from Van Helsing

3456
02:41:53,980 --> 02:41:55,980
come together to fight

3457
02:41:55,980 --> 02:41:57,980
some evil.

3458
02:41:57,980 --> 02:41:59,980
And it's

3459
02:41:59,980 --> 02:42:01,980
Sean Connery's in it.

3460
02:42:01,980 --> 02:42:03,980
It's only, yes, Literature Avengers.

3461
02:42:03,980 --> 02:42:05,980
Oh my god.

3462
02:42:05,980 --> 02:42:07,980
It's great. That sounds great.

3463
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:09,980
I was just going to be like, yeah,

3464
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:11,980
we can watch films

3465
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:13,980
like

3466
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:19,980
I was going to just show like movies

3467
02:42:19,980 --> 02:42:21,980
that I liked.

3468
02:42:21,980 --> 02:42:23,980
Because I was like, I don't mind watching this

3469
02:42:23,980 --> 02:42:25,980
again, except for this one.

3470
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:27,980
I don't want to watch this. A movie.

3471
02:42:27,980 --> 02:42:29,980
I don't want to watch this again.

3472
02:42:29,980 --> 02:42:31,980
What's your least favorite movie?

3473
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:33,980
My least favorite movie of all time?

3474
02:42:33,980 --> 02:42:35,980
Like, disgusting?

3475
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:37,980
Yeah, like it just like literally makes you cringe.

3476
02:42:37,980 --> 02:42:39,980
Oh gosh.

3477
02:42:39,980 --> 02:42:41,980
Okay, there was like a remake movie.

3478
02:42:41,980 --> 02:42:43,980
I was

3479
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:45,980
so pissed off at.

3480
02:42:45,980 --> 02:42:47,980
It was about

3481
02:42:47,980 --> 02:42:49,980
surfing. I don't remember what it was called.

3482
02:42:49,980 --> 02:42:51,980
Hmm.

3483
02:42:53,980 --> 02:42:55,980
It was about surfing.

3484
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:57,980
I was like, people were surfing.

3485
02:42:57,980 --> 02:42:59,980
And it's a remake of a movie.

3486
02:42:59,980 --> 02:43:01,980
It was like an action movie, right?

3487
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:03,980
And then I was

3488
02:43:03,980 --> 02:43:05,980
watching the remake of it.

3489
02:43:05,980 --> 02:43:07,980
And then I was

3490
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:09,980
point break. Yeah, that's the title. Point break.

3491
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:11,980
Point break? Oh, yeah.

3492
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,980
I heard that wasn't good.

3493
02:43:13,980 --> 02:43:15,980
I literally

3494
02:43:15,980 --> 02:43:17,980
booed in the theaters.

3495
02:43:17,980 --> 02:43:19,980
I booed. I booed

3496
02:43:19,980 --> 02:43:21,980
in the theater.

3497
02:43:21,980 --> 02:43:23,980
I kind of think. It was so bad.

3498
02:43:25,980 --> 02:43:27,980
I like walked out of a movie recently

3499
02:43:27,980 --> 02:43:29,980
because I was just like

3500
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:31,980
not. It was not good at all. I can't remember.

3501
02:43:31,980 --> 02:43:33,980
Oh, it's gonna bother me.

3502
02:43:33,980 --> 02:43:35,980
It was just like some

3503
02:43:35,980 --> 02:43:37,980
like I never was it. Was it Morbius?

3504
02:43:39,980 --> 02:43:41,980
More. It's Morbin time.

3505
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:45,980
I was like

3506
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:47,980
I don't usually

3507
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:49,980
like boo but like

3508
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:51,980
that was a movie that I had to be like

3509
02:43:51,980 --> 02:43:53,980
fuck that

3510
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:55,980
sucked. Like I scream. I almost

3511
02:43:55,980 --> 02:43:57,980
it was like a nearly empty theater and I was like

3512
02:43:57,980 --> 02:43:59,980
that fucking sucked. I got

3513
02:43:59,980 --> 02:44:01,980
to watch it for free and I was like I want my money back

3514
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:03,980
and I got it. I got in for free.

3515
02:44:03,980 --> 02:44:05,980
That's funny. Did you sneak in?

3516
02:44:05,980 --> 02:44:07,980
Oh, mercy.

3517
02:44:07,980 --> 02:44:09,980
I didn't sneak in.

3518
02:44:09,980 --> 02:44:11,980
I had a friend who worked at the theater

3519
02:44:11,980 --> 02:44:13,980
who was like here's a ticket for this movie.

3520
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:15,980
People canceled or something.

3521
02:44:15,980 --> 02:44:17,980
I can't remember because they knew it was bad.

3522
02:44:17,980 --> 02:44:19,980
They just like

3523
02:44:19,980 --> 02:44:21,980
Oh, I love movies.

3524
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:23,980
So I was like, yeah, let's go.

3525
02:44:23,980 --> 02:44:25,980
I was initially going to just like kind of

3526
02:44:25,980 --> 02:44:27,980
kind of relax in there because

3527
02:44:27,980 --> 02:44:29,980
it was kind of like a long day

3528
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:31,980
and then I was like, oh, it's okay.

3529
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:33,980
Even if I like fall asleep to the movie,

3530
02:44:33,980 --> 02:44:35,980
but of course I never fall asleep to a movie

3531
02:44:35,980 --> 02:44:37,980
because that's how like autistic

3532
02:44:37,980 --> 02:44:39,980
I

3533
02:44:39,980 --> 02:44:41,980
have to finish. You have to watch it and see it.

3534
02:44:41,980 --> 02:44:43,980
Yeah. And then I like watched it and I was like

3535
02:44:45,980 --> 02:44:47,980
this sucked. This like legitimately

3536
02:44:47,980 --> 02:44:49,980
sucks in every way. The acting

3537
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:51,980
sucked. Everything sucked.

3538
02:44:51,980 --> 02:44:53,980
Oh, no.

3539
02:44:53,980 --> 02:44:55,980
Oh my gosh, Apollo. Hold on.

3540
02:44:55,980 --> 02:44:57,980
I got a wrench.

3541
02:44:57,980 --> 02:44:59,980
Wrencher.

3542
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:01,980
Wrencher right now.

3543
02:45:01,980 --> 02:45:03,980
I like how we're still in the same call

3544
02:45:03,980 --> 02:45:05,980
and then Apollo, you can hop in any time

3545
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:07,980
if you want.

3546
02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:09,980
Because we're still in the same exact call.

3547
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:13,980
I didn't like the new Mission Impossible

3548
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:15,980
movie. I was very let down by that.

3549
02:45:15,980 --> 02:45:17,980
That wasn't good. I don't actually remember

3550
02:45:17,980 --> 02:45:19,980
any

3551
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:21,980
Mission Impossible movies.

3552
02:45:21,980 --> 02:45:23,980
I rewatched

3553
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:25,980
Minority Report. That's a great one.

3554
02:45:25,980 --> 02:45:27,980
Oh, Apollo!

3555
02:45:27,980 --> 02:45:29,980
Hello. I hope that's okay.

3556
02:45:29,980 --> 02:45:31,980
Hi.

3557
02:45:31,980 --> 02:45:33,980
Sorry, I don't have your Fuji up.

3558
02:45:33,980 --> 02:45:35,980
No, you're fine.

3559
02:45:35,980 --> 02:45:37,980
She's a disembodied voice.

3560
02:45:37,980 --> 02:45:39,980
I'm the voice in your head.

3561
02:45:39,980 --> 02:45:41,980
Nothing new.

3562
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:43,980
Just another one of my tulpas.

3563
02:45:43,980 --> 02:45:45,980
Gives you

3564
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:47,980
your Muppet back.

3565
02:45:55,980 --> 02:45:57,980
Muppetize me, Captain.

3566
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:01,980
I mean, if you want to include the model,

3567
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:03,980
I still got it up.

3568
02:46:03,980 --> 02:46:05,980
Oh, yeah. She can hop in

3569
02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:07,980
our model thingy.

3570
02:46:07,980 --> 02:46:09,980
Oh, yeah.

3571
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:11,980
If you want, if you want to know, it's okay.

3572
02:46:11,980 --> 02:46:13,980
I don't know how to do it, though.

3573
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:15,980
I hope that I've added you on Steam.

3574
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:17,980
Oh, yeah. We need to add

3575
02:46:17,980 --> 02:46:19,980
on Steam. We got Feast Dan.

3576
02:46:19,980 --> 02:46:21,980
Let's go.

3577
02:46:23,980 --> 02:46:25,980
Wait, I think you have to add

3578
02:46:27,980 --> 02:46:29,980
because we might have to add Mercy

3579
02:46:29,980 --> 02:46:31,980
because Mercy's like, Steam is broken.

3580
02:46:31,980 --> 02:46:33,980
I don't know. She couldn't add any of us.

3581
02:46:33,980 --> 02:46:35,980
I don't know why my Steam is broken.

3582
02:46:35,980 --> 02:46:37,980
It just decided like, I can't add people.

3583
02:46:37,980 --> 02:46:39,980
Poseidon's like, what's going on?

3584
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:47,980
Give me a second.

3585
02:46:47,980 --> 02:46:49,980
I'm just going to tell her

3586
02:46:49,980 --> 02:46:51,980
that's the time

3587
02:46:51,980 --> 02:46:53,980
when you die.

3588
02:46:53,980 --> 02:46:55,980
I'm kidding.

3589
02:46:55,980 --> 02:46:57,980
But, yeah,

3590
02:46:57,980 --> 02:46:59,980
we're just

3591
02:46:59,980 --> 02:47:01,980
not now. We're talking about like

3592
02:47:01,980 --> 02:47:03,980
worst movies we ever watched.

3593
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:05,980
It was the, I was saying, it was like

3594
02:47:05,980 --> 02:47:07,980
the new point blank,

3595
02:47:07,980 --> 02:47:09,980
the remake.

3596
02:47:09,980 --> 02:47:11,980
For me, human centipede.

3597
02:47:11,980 --> 02:47:13,980
Oh my god.

3598
02:47:13,980 --> 02:47:15,980
Human centipede.

3599
02:47:15,980 --> 02:47:17,980
Oh my god.

3600
02:47:17,980 --> 02:47:19,980
Human centipede.

3601
02:47:19,980 --> 02:47:21,980
Oh my god.

3602
02:47:21,980 --> 02:47:23,980
Human centipede.

3603
02:47:23,980 --> 02:47:25,980
Don't even get me started on that.

3604
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:27,980
I'm not going to lie to you.

3605
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:29,980
I'm not going to lie to you.

3606
02:47:29,980 --> 02:47:31,980
I have never watched

3607
02:47:31,980 --> 02:47:33,980
human centipede.

3608
02:47:33,980 --> 02:47:35,980
Good. Don't ever.

3609
02:47:35,980 --> 02:47:37,980
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

3610
02:47:37,980 --> 02:47:39,980
But like, what if it's good?

3611
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:41,980
It's not.

3612
02:47:43,980 --> 02:47:45,980
I'll save you the time.

3613
02:47:45,980 --> 02:47:47,980
I'll save you the time.

3614
02:47:47,980 --> 02:47:49,980
It isn't good. Like, not even like,

3615
02:47:49,980 --> 02:47:51,980
oh, it's so weird. It's funny good.

3616
02:47:51,980 --> 02:47:53,980
Yeah, there's three. No, it's not even

3617
02:47:53,980 --> 02:47:55,980
funny good.

3618
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:57,980
Dude, I watched all three of them when I was

3619
02:47:57,980 --> 02:47:59,980
sick. Oh girl.

3620
02:47:59,980 --> 02:48:01,980
I only watched the first one. I'm like, I'm good.

3621
02:48:01,980 --> 02:48:03,980
I'm good.

3622
02:48:03,980 --> 02:48:05,980
I was like, I don't understand it.

3623
02:48:05,980 --> 02:48:07,980
But I wanted to keep watching it.

3624
02:48:07,980 --> 02:48:09,980
I forgot that I asked

3625
02:48:09,980 --> 02:48:11,980
manager for our

3626
02:48:11,980 --> 02:48:13,980
logo and

3627
02:48:13,980 --> 02:48:15,980
he gave it.

3628
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:17,980
Are you okay? He gave it to me like

3629
02:48:17,980 --> 02:48:19,980
two hours ago.

3630
02:48:19,980 --> 02:48:21,980
And I never noticed it.

3631
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:23,980
Hold on. Let me go.

3632
02:48:25,980 --> 02:48:27,980
If you want to join

3633
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:29,980
the thingy, here's the

3634
02:48:29,980 --> 02:48:31,980
password.

3635
02:48:31,980 --> 02:48:33,980
I'm going to DM you the password.

3636
02:48:39,980 --> 02:48:41,980
And let me just

3637
02:48:41,980 --> 02:48:43,980
add it.

3638
02:48:43,980 --> 02:48:45,980
I'm so sorry.

3639
02:48:49,980 --> 02:48:51,980
She asked like two hours ago

3640
02:48:51,980 --> 02:48:53,980
for that.

3641
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:55,980
I don't know if you still need the logo.

3642
02:48:55,980 --> 02:48:57,980
Here you go.

3643
02:48:59,980 --> 02:49:01,980
I'm forgetful.

3644
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:05,980
It wasn't Manay. Manay said I know also like

3645
02:49:05,980 --> 02:49:07,980
asleep.

3646
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:09,980
Well, no, he like he I think he gave it to

3647
02:49:09,980 --> 02:49:11,980
me six to 20 minutes later

3648
02:49:11,980 --> 02:49:13,980
after I

3649
02:49:13,980 --> 02:49:15,980
asked.

3650
02:49:15,980 --> 02:49:17,980
So it wasn't like

3651
02:49:17,980 --> 02:49:19,980
it wasn't like too far off.

3652
02:49:29,980 --> 02:49:31,980
Okay. That's the password

3653
02:49:31,980 --> 02:49:33,980
and the server

3654
02:49:33,980 --> 02:49:35,980
we're on if you wanted to join.

3655
02:49:35,980 --> 02:49:37,980
Grab a blankie and

3656
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:39,980
come on down.

3657
02:49:39,980 --> 02:49:41,980
Thank you.

3658
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:43,980
And then we can like

3659
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:45,980
we'll pop you in the middle.

3660
02:49:45,980 --> 02:49:47,980
Yeah.

3661
02:49:47,980 --> 02:49:49,980
Thank you.

3662
02:49:49,980 --> 02:49:51,980
Oh my god.

3663
02:49:51,980 --> 02:49:53,980
Her laugh is so adorable.

3664
02:49:53,980 --> 02:49:55,980
She's like

3665
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:57,980
scary movies.

3666
02:49:57,980 --> 02:49:59,980
The most recent scary movies that I've seen

3667
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:01,980
are Smile

3668
02:50:01,980 --> 02:50:03,980
and Talk to Me.

3669
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:05,980
Smile.

3670
02:50:05,980 --> 02:50:07,980
I thought you meant like scary movie,

3671
02:50:07,980 --> 02:50:09,980
the one that's supposed to

3672
02:50:09,980 --> 02:50:11,980
paradise screen, I think.

3673
02:50:11,980 --> 02:50:13,980
Those were great.

3674
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:15,980
And then I couldn't remember which one was the original

3675
02:50:15,980 --> 02:50:17,980
and which one wasn't.

3676
02:50:17,980 --> 02:50:19,980
The Shane Dawson film.

3677
02:50:19,980 --> 02:50:21,980
No, not the smiley man or whatever the fuck it's called.

3678
02:50:21,980 --> 02:50:23,980
I thought it was the continuation from Shane Dawson.

3679
02:50:23,980 --> 02:50:25,980
No.

3680
02:50:25,980 --> 02:50:27,980
If you like horror,

3681
02:50:27,980 --> 02:50:29,980
watch it. Smile is good.

3682
02:50:29,980 --> 02:50:31,980
It's very unnerving.

3683
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:33,980
I haven't had a unnerving movie watch

3684
02:50:33,980 --> 02:50:35,980
in a very long time.

3685
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:37,980
It's not scary anymore.

3686
02:50:37,980 --> 02:50:39,980
It's just like jump scare and I'm like, okay.

3687
02:50:39,980 --> 02:50:41,980
I don't like horror movies that just rely on jump scares.

3688
02:50:41,980 --> 02:50:43,980
I like plot.

3689
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:45,980
To me, a horror film

3690
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:49,980
is

3691
02:50:49,980 --> 02:50:51,980
is

3692
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:53,980
like a mystery, you know?

3693
02:50:53,980 --> 02:50:55,980
Yeah. I want to be thrilled.

3694
02:50:55,980 --> 02:50:57,980
I want to be unsettled and hereditary definitely have that.

3695
02:50:57,980 --> 02:50:59,980
I love hereditary.

3696
02:50:59,980 --> 02:51:01,980
It's such a great call back

3697
02:51:01,980 --> 02:51:03,980
to Rosemary's Baby.

3698
02:51:03,980 --> 02:51:05,980
Have you watched Rosemary's Baby?

3699
02:51:05,980 --> 02:51:07,980
Yeah.

3700
02:51:07,980 --> 02:51:09,980
It makes so much references to it.

3701
02:51:09,980 --> 02:51:11,980
It was so fun.

3702
02:51:13,980 --> 02:51:15,980
It was so fun. I really do think though

3703
02:51:15,980 --> 02:51:17,980
people who watch hereditary should

3704
02:51:17,980 --> 02:51:19,980
heredity?

3705
02:51:19,980 --> 02:51:21,980
Hereditary?

3706
02:51:21,980 --> 02:51:23,980
Yeah. Should watch

3707
02:51:23,980 --> 02:51:25,980
Rosemary's Baby.

3708
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:27,980
I find a lot of horror

3709
02:51:27,980 --> 02:51:29,980
like

3710
02:51:29,980 --> 02:51:31,980
what's the word?

3711
02:51:31,980 --> 02:51:33,980
It makes references to past horror

3712
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:35,980
horror films.

3713
02:51:35,980 --> 02:51:37,980
Yeah. I like the little nods.

3714
02:51:37,980 --> 02:51:39,980
Yeah.

3715
02:51:39,980 --> 02:51:41,980
Is that the one where they like

3716
02:51:41,980 --> 02:51:43,980
splice the DNA with this girl and this alien?

3717
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:45,980
Isn't it the bald lady that's hot?

3718
02:51:45,980 --> 02:51:47,980
I think so.

3719
02:51:47,980 --> 02:51:49,980
Yeah.

3720
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:51,980
I watch like a synopsis

3721
02:51:51,980 --> 02:51:53,980
because you never just like want to watch a movie

3722
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:55,980
but you don't want to watch a movie.

3723
02:51:55,980 --> 02:51:57,980
So you watch this like YouTube or the AI voice.

3724
02:51:57,980 --> 02:51:59,980
Yeah.

3725
02:51:59,980 --> 02:52:01,980
That's me. I watch that.

3726
02:52:01,980 --> 02:52:03,980
Sadly, I can't join you guys.

3727
02:52:03,980 --> 02:52:05,980
You're giving me an error.

3728
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:07,980
Man!

3729
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:09,980
Are you doing a capital?

3730
02:52:11,980 --> 02:52:13,980
I was just kind of copy and pasted.

3731
02:52:13,980 --> 02:52:15,980
Oh.

3732
02:52:15,980 --> 02:52:17,980
Are you on Eastern North America?

3733
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:19,980
Yeah.

3734
02:52:19,980 --> 02:52:21,980
Hold on.

3735
02:52:21,980 --> 02:52:23,980
Do you have to add me on urine from the list?

3736
02:52:23,980 --> 02:52:25,980
I think

3737
02:52:25,980 --> 02:52:27,980
Mercy does actually.

3738
02:52:27,980 --> 02:52:29,980
How do I do that?

3739
02:52:29,980 --> 02:52:31,980
Open up the

3740
02:52:31,980 --> 02:52:33,980
guest list and do the plus sign

3741
02:52:33,980 --> 02:52:35,980
and then invite. Oh, it's not working.

3742
02:52:35,980 --> 02:52:37,980
Hold on.

3743
02:52:37,980 --> 02:52:39,980
Maybe I'll just have to do it again.

3744
02:52:39,980 --> 02:52:41,980
Okay.

3745
02:52:41,980 --> 02:52:43,980
It's me. I'm the problem.

3746
02:52:43,980 --> 02:52:45,980
Oh, you're not! It's me.

3747
02:52:45,980 --> 02:52:47,980
Hold on. It's me.

3748
02:52:47,980 --> 02:52:49,980
I'm like the one who's not used to this.

3749
02:52:49,980 --> 02:52:51,980
I'm the problem.

3750
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:53,980
It's me. There we go.

3751
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:55,980
It should work now.

3752
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:57,980
It should let you in.

3753
02:52:57,980 --> 02:52:59,980
Yay!

3754
02:52:59,980 --> 02:53:01,980
Yes!

3755
02:53:01,980 --> 02:53:03,980
It works!

3756
02:53:03,980 --> 02:53:05,980
Oh, shit. Chibi's gone.

3757
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:07,980
Oh, no way. Don't worry.

3758
02:53:07,980 --> 02:53:09,980
I'll load in in just a moment.

3759
02:53:09,980 --> 02:53:11,980
I think everyone has to reload in.

3760
02:53:13,980 --> 02:53:15,980
Alright, I'm going to even come back.

3761
02:53:17,980 --> 02:53:19,980
That's me in the corner.

3762
02:53:21,980 --> 02:53:23,980
That's me in the spot.

3763
02:53:23,980 --> 02:53:25,980
Oh, by myself.

3764
02:53:25,980 --> 02:53:27,980
Oh, somebody's controlling.

3765
02:53:29,980 --> 02:53:31,980
Oh, by myself.

3766
02:53:33,980 --> 02:53:35,980
You can't misbehave.

3767
02:53:35,980 --> 02:53:37,980
I'll tattle on you.

3768
02:53:37,980 --> 02:53:39,980
Why haven't I loaded in yet?

3769
02:53:39,980 --> 02:53:41,980
I don't know.

3770
02:53:41,980 --> 02:53:43,980
Dang. I think you're coming.

3771
02:53:43,980 --> 02:53:45,980
Oh, I see you on my end. Are you coming?

3772
02:53:45,980 --> 02:53:47,980
Yeah, I'm coming for you.

3773
02:53:47,980 --> 02:53:49,980
Wow, wow, wow.

3774
02:53:51,980 --> 02:53:53,980
You're going to make those noises for me tonight?

3775
02:53:53,980 --> 02:53:55,980
Damn. Just like that.

3776
02:53:55,980 --> 02:53:57,980
Wow, wow, wow.

3777
02:53:57,980 --> 02:53:59,980
Imagine? Oh, my God.

3778
02:54:01,980 --> 02:54:03,980
Be pure night.

3779
02:54:03,980 --> 02:54:05,980
I'm going to start doing that on my Patreon audios.

3780
02:54:05,980 --> 02:54:07,980
No.

3781
02:54:07,980 --> 02:54:09,980
Wow, wow, wow.

3782
02:54:09,980 --> 02:54:11,980
It's like I can hear their voices.

3783
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:13,980
I can hear their voices.

3784
02:54:15,980 --> 02:54:17,980
That's so funny though.

3785
02:54:17,980 --> 02:54:19,980
Mercy.

3786
02:54:19,980 --> 02:54:21,980
Mercy.

3787
02:54:21,980 --> 02:54:23,980
No, it's not the girls.

3788
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:25,980
A Christmas past.

3789
02:54:27,980 --> 02:54:29,980
Yeah.

3790
02:54:29,980 --> 02:54:31,980
What did I do in this lifetime?

3791
02:54:31,980 --> 02:54:35,980
That will make me forever shackled to mine.

3792
02:54:35,980 --> 02:54:37,980
You didn't shake your ass hard enough.

3793
02:54:37,980 --> 02:54:39,980
Oh, shit.

3794
02:54:41,980 --> 02:54:43,980
Anyways.

3795
02:54:43,980 --> 02:54:45,980
Why are you not loading in?

3796
02:54:45,980 --> 02:54:47,980
What the heck?

3797
02:54:47,980 --> 02:54:49,980
I don't know.

3798
02:54:49,980 --> 02:54:51,980
I'm leaving.

3799
02:54:51,980 --> 02:54:53,980
And I'm coming back.

3800
02:54:55,980 --> 02:54:57,980
Show model, show model.

3801
02:54:57,980 --> 02:54:59,980
Show model, show model.

3802
02:54:59,980 --> 02:55:01,980
Show model?

3803
02:55:01,980 --> 02:55:03,980
Show model.

3804
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:11,980
Oh, you showed up on my end.

3805
02:55:11,980 --> 02:55:13,980
Oh, there we go.

3806
02:55:15,980 --> 02:55:17,980
I'm all by myself.

3807
02:55:17,980 --> 02:55:19,980
Oops, you almost saw that.

3808
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:27,980
Yay.

3809
02:55:27,980 --> 02:55:29,980
I can pull you down.

3810
02:55:29,980 --> 02:55:31,980
Hey.

3811
02:55:31,980 --> 02:55:33,980
I didn't know that you have such a cool fucking dress.

3812
02:55:33,980 --> 02:55:35,980
Hello.

3813
02:55:35,980 --> 02:55:37,980
Yeah, your dress is so fantastic.

3814
02:55:37,980 --> 02:55:39,980
Thank you.

3815
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:41,980
Hold on, let me move myself over.

3816
02:55:49,980 --> 02:55:51,980
She's so big next to me.

3817
02:55:51,980 --> 02:55:53,980
Ah, are you sheepsters?

3818
02:55:55,980 --> 02:55:57,980
There we go.

3819
02:55:57,980 --> 02:55:59,980
How tall Paolo is in like canon?

3820
02:55:59,980 --> 02:56:01,980
God is pretty tall, right?

3821
02:56:01,980 --> 02:56:03,980
Drop your height.

3822
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:05,980
411.

3823
02:56:05,980 --> 02:56:07,980
Oh, she's small.

3824
02:56:07,980 --> 02:56:09,980
You're small.

3825
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:11,980
Get down here.

3826
02:56:11,980 --> 02:56:13,980
Get down here.

3827
02:56:13,980 --> 02:56:15,980
I'm the tallest.

3828
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:17,980
I'm the short queen.

3829
02:56:17,980 --> 02:56:19,980
Whoa, size.

3830
02:56:19,980 --> 02:56:21,980
Are you kidding me?

3831
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:23,980
Let me show you something.

3832
02:56:23,980 --> 02:56:25,980
Oh, it's going to be fun.

3833
02:56:25,980 --> 02:56:27,980
She's a short stack.

3834
02:56:27,980 --> 02:56:29,980
Who's that sassy child?

3835
02:56:29,980 --> 02:56:31,980
Literally a sassy child.

3836
02:56:31,980 --> 02:56:33,980
Oh my God, she can lullify herself.

3837
02:56:35,980 --> 02:56:37,980
She defied herself.

3838
02:56:37,980 --> 02:56:39,980
Yeah, she defied myself.

3839
02:56:39,980 --> 02:56:41,980
I'm a creature.

3840
02:56:41,980 --> 02:56:43,980
That's so cute.

3841
02:56:43,980 --> 02:56:45,980
What the heck? I want that toggle.

3842
02:56:45,980 --> 02:56:47,980
Management.

3843
02:56:47,980 --> 02:56:49,980
Make me cute.

3844
02:56:49,980 --> 02:56:51,980
Oh my gosh, it's like suddenly you got like

3845
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:53,980
bop-a-de-dead.

3846
02:56:55,980 --> 02:56:57,980
I can't, I can't.

3847
02:56:57,980 --> 02:56:59,980
That was so cute.

3848
02:56:59,980 --> 02:57:01,980
La critura.

3849
02:57:01,980 --> 02:57:03,980
La critura.

3850
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:05,980
La critura.

3851
02:57:07,980 --> 02:57:09,980
I'm adjusting everyone.

3852
02:57:09,980 --> 02:57:11,980
I feel like we should play a game.

3853
02:57:11,980 --> 02:57:13,980
Like we should play like a sleepover game.

3854
02:57:13,980 --> 02:57:15,980
Oh my gosh.

3855
02:57:15,980 --> 02:57:17,980
We can gossip.

3856
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:19,980
We can gossip about.

3857
02:57:19,980 --> 02:57:21,980
We can gossip about.

3858
02:57:21,980 --> 02:57:23,980
Do you guys have any hot goss?

3859
02:57:23,980 --> 02:57:25,980
Did you go to Anime Expo, Apollo?

3860
02:57:25,980 --> 02:57:27,980
Sadly, no, I didn't.

3861
02:57:27,980 --> 02:57:29,980
I'll be going to TwitchCon though.

3862
02:57:29,980 --> 02:57:31,980
Ooh, fun.

3863
02:57:31,980 --> 02:57:35,980
Sonic Expo in November with Fifi and

3864
02:57:35,980 --> 02:57:37,980
Chibidoki E.

3865
02:57:37,980 --> 02:57:39,980
Oh, nice. That'll be fun.

3866
02:57:39,980 --> 02:57:41,980
E, hopefully Hades too.

3867
02:57:41,980 --> 02:57:43,980
I hope Hades can make it.

3868
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:45,980
I want to go to Akon so bad.

3869
02:57:45,980 --> 02:57:47,980
Me too.

3870
02:57:47,980 --> 02:57:49,980
I guess so shy.

3871
02:57:49,980 --> 02:57:51,980
I don't want to be alone.

3872
02:57:51,980 --> 02:57:53,980
No, I agree 100%

3873
02:57:53,980 --> 02:57:55,980
because this will be my first

3874
02:57:55,980 --> 02:57:57,980
TwitchCon in real life.

3875
02:57:57,980 --> 02:57:59,980
And I'm like, ooh,

3876
02:57:59,980 --> 02:58:01,980
I'm a little nervous.

3877
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:03,980
Do you have any con stories?

3878
02:58:05,980 --> 02:58:07,980
Sorry, again?

3879
02:58:07,980 --> 02:58:09,980
Do you have any con stories?

3880
02:58:11,980 --> 02:58:13,980
Let's see.

3881
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:15,980
We're having a really good moment.

3882
02:58:17,980 --> 02:58:19,980
I'm gonna be honest with you.

3883
02:58:19,980 --> 02:58:21,980
My first official con

3884
02:58:21,980 --> 02:58:23,980
was this year with the rest of the girls.

3885
02:58:23,980 --> 02:58:25,980
And

3886
02:58:25,980 --> 02:58:27,980
we had a sold out room

3887
02:58:27,980 --> 02:58:29,980
and I was like, ooh,

3888
02:58:29,980 --> 02:58:31,980
wow, that's crazy.

3889
02:58:31,980 --> 02:58:33,980
Damn.

3890
02:58:33,980 --> 02:58:35,980
There was a lot of people there.

3891
02:58:35,980 --> 02:58:37,980
That was just so awkward with everybody.

3892
02:58:37,980 --> 02:58:39,980
I was just shaking my titties.

3893
02:58:39,980 --> 02:58:41,980
As one should.

3894
02:58:41,980 --> 02:58:43,980
As one should.

3895
02:58:43,980 --> 02:58:45,980
It was just like, I'll show off the feets too.

3896
02:58:45,980 --> 02:58:47,980
Yes.

3897
02:58:47,980 --> 02:58:49,980
Yes, as we should.

3898
02:58:49,980 --> 02:58:51,980
After all, those are the rigs

3899
02:58:51,980 --> 02:58:53,980
that people care about.

3900
02:58:53,980 --> 02:58:55,980
Hell yeah.

3901
02:58:55,980 --> 02:58:57,980
I wish there was a toggle where I could take off my heel

3902
02:58:57,980 --> 02:58:59,980
and just throw it at the camera.

3903
02:58:59,980 --> 02:59:01,980
Dude.

3904
02:59:05,980 --> 02:59:07,980
The only thing I can do with my feet

3905
02:59:07,980 --> 02:59:09,980
is just that they showed the beans.

3906
02:59:09,980 --> 02:59:11,980
Ooh.

3907
02:59:11,980 --> 02:59:13,980
My feet is like stationary.

3908
02:59:13,980 --> 02:59:15,980
It's not great.

3909
02:59:15,980 --> 02:59:17,980
Oh yeah, I forgot if your feet were up.

3910
02:59:17,980 --> 02:59:19,980
Sorry, my cat's food is going off.

3911
02:59:21,980 --> 02:59:23,980
That's one of the characters

3912
02:59:23,980 --> 02:59:25,980
on my channel is my cat's food dispenser.

3913
02:59:29,980 --> 02:59:31,980
I can understand that.

3914
02:59:31,980 --> 02:59:33,980
I have a lot of my cats would,

3915
02:59:33,980 --> 02:59:35,980
every single time I'm streaming,

3916
02:59:35,980 --> 02:59:37,980
they all come out of the dark shadows

3917
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:39,980
and they're just trying to give my attention.

3918
02:59:39,980 --> 02:59:41,980
But when I'm not streaming, they don't give a fuck.

3919
02:59:41,980 --> 02:59:43,980
I know, right?

3920
02:59:43,980 --> 02:59:45,980
I'm just like, wow, okay.

3921
02:59:45,980 --> 02:59:47,980
Do your cats sit on your keyboard?

3922
02:59:47,980 --> 02:59:49,980
Oh, very much so.

3923
02:59:49,980 --> 02:59:51,980
Yes.

3924
02:59:51,980 --> 02:59:53,980
Yeah, I usually have like two,

3925
02:59:53,980 --> 02:59:55,980
there's usually a cat on my lap

3926
02:59:55,980 --> 02:59:57,980
and then a cat on the bed that's on my desk.

3927
02:59:57,980 --> 02:59:59,980
So that they, and then they sometimes fight over the bed

3928
02:59:59,980 --> 03:00:01,980
because they want to all just be there

3929
03:00:01,980 --> 03:00:03,980
and I'm just like, guys, please, oh my god.

3930
03:00:03,980 --> 03:00:05,980
I almost choked

3931
03:00:05,980 --> 03:00:07,980
on playing against

3932
03:00:07,980 --> 03:00:09,980
Radon for Elden Ring

3933
03:00:09,980 --> 03:00:11,980
because my cat decided to jump

3934
03:00:11,980 --> 03:00:13,980
off on my lap and in front of my screen

3935
03:00:13,980 --> 03:00:15,980
and I was literally so close

3936
03:00:15,980 --> 03:00:17,980
to dying.

3937
03:00:19,980 --> 03:00:21,980
That's so funny. I don't have pets.

3938
03:00:21,980 --> 03:00:23,980
I'm always like,

3939
03:00:23,980 --> 03:00:25,980
I love hearing people's pet stories.

3940
03:00:27,980 --> 03:00:29,980
I'm very much a cat lady.

3941
03:00:29,980 --> 03:00:31,980
When I tell you how many cats I have,

3942
03:00:31,980 --> 03:00:33,980
how many cats you got?

3943
03:00:33,980 --> 03:00:35,980
I have seven cats

3944
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:37,980
and I take care

3945
03:00:37,980 --> 03:00:39,980
of one cat that's outside.

3946
03:00:41,980 --> 03:00:43,980
So like eight cats in total?

3947
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:45,980
You have seven cats

3948
03:00:45,980 --> 03:00:47,980
and a bonus outdoor cat.

3949
03:00:49,980 --> 03:00:51,980
I have three cats.

3950
03:00:51,980 --> 03:00:53,980
I don't know what I would do if I had

3951
03:00:53,980 --> 03:00:55,980
eight running across my room.

3952
03:00:55,980 --> 03:00:57,980
I love

3953
03:00:57,980 --> 03:00:59,980
cats so much.

3954
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:01,980
I'm very much a person

3955
03:01:01,980 --> 03:01:03,980
at heart that just like,

3956
03:01:03,980 --> 03:01:05,980
I just love taking care of animals.

3957
03:01:05,980 --> 03:01:07,980
That's so sweet.

3958
03:01:07,980 --> 03:01:09,980
Do you have any other pets?

3959
03:01:09,980 --> 03:01:11,980
Well, let's see.

3960
03:01:11,980 --> 03:01:13,980
They're not really pets and they're not mine

3961
03:01:13,980 --> 03:01:15,980
but I do have roosters outside.

3962
03:01:15,980 --> 03:01:17,980
I was just standing there with a rooster

3963
03:01:17,980 --> 03:01:19,980
because of a rooster crow

3964
03:01:19,980 --> 03:01:21,980
right before we started streaming.

3965
03:01:21,980 --> 03:01:23,980
I was like, is that her doorbell?

3966
03:01:23,980 --> 03:01:25,980
I was like, I have no idea.

3967
03:01:25,980 --> 03:01:27,980
And I'm like, how do you not know?

3968
03:01:27,980 --> 03:01:29,980
She doesn't know because

3969
03:01:29,980 --> 03:01:31,980
we stream at different times

3970
03:01:31,980 --> 03:01:33,980
and it just has not happened.

3971
03:01:33,980 --> 03:01:35,980
Because of like, she's your gen mate.

3972
03:01:37,980 --> 03:01:39,980
She has roosters.

3973
03:01:41,980 --> 03:01:43,980
That was so funny though.

3974
03:01:43,980 --> 03:01:45,980
Yeah, I have like

3975
03:01:45,980 --> 03:01:47,980
an area where I live.

3976
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:49,980
There's like a bunch of chickens and roosters around.

3977
03:01:49,980 --> 03:01:51,980
We just have them.

3978
03:01:51,980 --> 03:01:53,980
I want chickens and roosters.

3979
03:01:53,980 --> 03:01:55,980
A few of them have little farms for us.

3980
03:01:55,980 --> 03:01:57,980
I want to lay an egg.

3981
03:01:57,980 --> 03:01:59,980
No, I don't.

3982
03:01:59,980 --> 03:02:01,980
Honestly, I just get happy because

3983
03:02:01,980 --> 03:02:03,980
they bless me with eggs

3984
03:02:03,980 --> 03:02:05,980
and I'm just like, I don't got to go to market now.

3985
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:07,980
I know eggs are so expensive.

3986
03:02:07,980 --> 03:02:09,980
I hate eggs.

3987
03:02:09,980 --> 03:02:11,980
I hate eggs.

3988
03:02:11,980 --> 03:02:13,980
You hate it.

3989
03:02:13,980 --> 03:02:15,980
Oh yeah, that's right. You don't like eggs.

3990
03:02:15,980 --> 03:02:17,980
I usually don't like eggs but I need them to cook the brownies

3991
03:02:17,980 --> 03:02:19,980
that I've been sitting in my cabinet

3992
03:02:19,980 --> 03:02:21,980
and I'm very mad

3993
03:02:21,980 --> 03:02:23,980
because I need to cook these brownies.

3994
03:02:23,980 --> 03:02:25,980
Eggs, evil. I'm allergic. They kill me.

3995
03:02:25,980 --> 03:02:27,980
Please don't die.

3996
03:02:27,980 --> 03:02:29,980
My nemesis.

3997
03:02:29,980 --> 03:02:31,980
I can never escape it.

3998
03:02:33,980 --> 03:02:35,980
So you can't have mayo?

3999
03:02:35,980 --> 03:02:37,980
I can have vegan mayo.

4000
03:02:37,980 --> 03:02:39,980
Oh okay, vegan mayo is pretty good.

4001
03:02:39,980 --> 03:02:41,980
Yeah, it tastes like,

4002
03:02:41,980 --> 03:02:43,980
people say it tastes like

4003
03:02:43,980 --> 03:02:45,980
helmets.

4004
03:02:45,980 --> 03:02:47,980
Yes.

4005
03:02:47,980 --> 03:02:49,980
But like, I love,

4006
03:02:49,980 --> 03:02:51,980
gosh, it's like you have a little

4007
03:02:51,980 --> 03:02:53,980
farm outside.

4008
03:02:53,980 --> 03:02:55,980
Are we so convenient?

4009
03:02:55,980 --> 03:02:57,980
I want to get little chickens and goats

4010
03:02:57,980 --> 03:02:59,980
and dogs

4011
03:02:59,980 --> 03:03:01,980
and horse.

4012
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:03,980
That would be cool.

4013
03:03:03,980 --> 03:03:05,980
So many animals.

4014
03:03:05,980 --> 03:03:07,980
Why do you have a,

4015
03:03:07,980 --> 03:03:09,980
did you just yawn?

4016
03:03:09,980 --> 03:03:11,980
No, Paula.

4017
03:03:11,980 --> 03:03:13,980
Me? Yeah.

4018
03:03:13,980 --> 03:03:15,980
No, I don't think I did.

4019
03:03:15,980 --> 03:03:17,980
Oh okay, because you're reading something.

4020
03:03:17,980 --> 03:03:19,980
Oh, because your face looks like this.

4021
03:03:19,980 --> 03:03:21,980
You were just like,

4022
03:03:21,980 --> 03:03:23,980
and I'm like, why does she look like this?

4023
03:03:23,980 --> 03:03:25,980
I was like, wow.

4024
03:03:25,980 --> 03:03:27,980
So basically,

4025
03:03:27,980 --> 03:03:29,980
I'm using my webcam right now

4026
03:03:29,980 --> 03:03:31,980
and

4027
03:03:31,980 --> 03:03:33,980
my tracking is not the best

4028
03:03:33,980 --> 03:03:35,980
right now because my iPhone,

4029
03:03:35,980 --> 03:03:37,980
I need to.

4030
03:03:37,980 --> 03:03:39,980
I need to have a prepaid

4031
03:03:39,980 --> 03:03:41,980
eSIM again.

4032
03:03:41,980 --> 03:03:43,980
Oh no.

4033
03:03:43,980 --> 03:03:45,980
Yeah, for my iPhone.

4034
03:03:45,980 --> 03:03:47,980
But you just need to be connected to Wi-Fi.

4035
03:03:47,980 --> 03:03:49,980
No, I'm in, okay, so let me tell you.

4036
03:03:49,980 --> 03:03:51,980
I set up

4037
03:03:51,980 --> 03:03:53,980
my VR setup in the garage here.

4038
03:03:53,980 --> 03:03:55,980
It's like super big, really big,

4039
03:03:55,980 --> 03:03:57,980
but the internet does not connect to my iPhone

4040
03:03:57,980 --> 03:03:59,980
over here.

4041
03:03:59,980 --> 03:04:01,980
And it does a pretty well job

4042
03:04:01,980 --> 03:04:03,980
except it kind of delays

4043
03:04:03,980 --> 03:04:05,980
like a few 10 seconds

4044
03:04:05,980 --> 03:04:07,980
and it looks really awesome.

4045
03:04:07,980 --> 03:04:09,980
So now I'm just like, okay,

4046
03:04:09,980 --> 03:04:11,980
time to go reinstall that

4047
03:04:11,980 --> 03:04:13,980
shit again.

4048
03:04:13,980 --> 03:04:15,980
Oh man.

4049
03:04:15,980 --> 03:04:17,980
In the garage?

4050
03:04:17,980 --> 03:04:19,980
Yeah, in the garage.

4051
03:04:19,980 --> 03:04:21,980
It's actually really nice in here.

4052
03:04:21,980 --> 03:04:23,980
I'm a little ketchup

4053
03:04:23,980 --> 03:04:25,980
ketchup, my little kitchen

4054
03:04:25,980 --> 03:04:27,980
here and my bathroom.

4055
03:04:27,980 --> 03:04:29,980
There's a kitchen in the garage?

4056
03:04:29,980 --> 03:04:31,980
There's a bathroom in the garage?

4057
03:04:31,980 --> 03:04:33,980
I want to live like a Paul.

4058
03:04:33,980 --> 03:04:35,980
With a little mini shower.

4059
03:04:35,980 --> 03:04:37,980
What?

4060
03:04:37,980 --> 03:04:39,980
Yeah.

4061
03:04:39,980 --> 03:04:41,980
So I just kind of...

4062
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:43,980
Can I live with you?

4063
03:04:43,980 --> 03:04:45,980
I'll bring my cat.

4064
03:04:45,980 --> 03:04:47,980
I'll be a

4065
03:04:47,980 --> 03:04:49,980
good housewife

4066
03:04:49,980 --> 03:04:51,980
and I'll don you when needed.

4067
03:04:51,980 --> 03:04:53,980
Yes.

4068
03:04:53,980 --> 03:04:55,980
I have a lot to offer.

4069
03:04:55,980 --> 03:04:57,980
That is a big ass garage.

4070
03:04:57,980 --> 03:04:59,980
It is really big.

4071
03:04:59,980 --> 03:05:01,980
Are you sure it's not a house?

4072
03:05:01,980 --> 03:05:03,980
It's not a house.

4073
03:05:03,980 --> 03:05:05,980
It sounds like a

4074
03:05:05,980 --> 03:05:07,980
like an in-law

4075
03:05:07,980 --> 03:05:09,980
like if it's like construction

4076
03:05:09,980 --> 03:05:11,980
and then just like essentially put a little in-law in there.

4077
03:05:13,980 --> 03:05:15,980
Whatever they call it.

4078
03:05:15,980 --> 03:05:17,980
It's a free DOM arrangement.

4079
03:05:17,980 --> 03:05:19,980
Yeah, free DOM.

4080
03:05:19,980 --> 03:05:21,980
There are some

4081
03:05:21,980 --> 03:05:23,980
arrangements where I'm kind of like

4082
03:05:23,980 --> 03:05:25,980
surprised to hear about because I'm like

4083
03:05:25,980 --> 03:05:27,980
what do you mean you're streaming from

4084
03:05:27,980 --> 03:05:29,980
the basement or the shed?

4085
03:05:29,980 --> 03:05:31,980
Yeah, you know, it's just like

4086
03:05:31,980 --> 03:05:33,980
people stream wherever I guess.

4087
03:05:33,980 --> 03:05:35,980
I don't...

4088
03:05:35,980 --> 03:05:37,980
I still can't

4089
03:05:37,980 --> 03:05:39,980
fathom how I see streams

4090
03:05:39,980 --> 03:05:41,980
on just a laptop in the half as one screen

4091
03:05:41,980 --> 03:05:43,980
and does everything and when

4092
03:05:43,980 --> 03:05:45,980
she does her DJ stream

4093
03:05:45,980 --> 03:05:47,980
she only does it on her laptop.

4094
03:05:47,980 --> 03:05:49,980
That's amazing.

4095
03:05:49,980 --> 03:05:51,980
Get this one by the computer.

4096
03:05:51,980 --> 03:05:53,980
If you're watching, do it right now Snowberries.

4097
03:05:53,980 --> 03:05:55,980
Do it.

4098
03:05:55,980 --> 03:05:57,980
Yeah, she needs a computer.

4099
03:05:57,980 --> 03:05:59,980
Oh my god.

4100
03:05:59,980 --> 03:06:01,980
I just sit in a corner

4101
03:06:01,980 --> 03:06:03,980
in my open concept

4102
03:06:03,980 --> 03:06:05,980
studio-esque apartment

4103
03:06:05,980 --> 03:06:07,980
and just scream

4104
03:06:07,980 --> 03:06:09,980
and hope that my neighbors don't hear me.

4105
03:06:09,980 --> 03:06:11,980
I live with my parents.

4106
03:06:11,980 --> 03:06:13,980
It's like

4107
03:06:13,980 --> 03:06:15,980
wow, what am I doing? I live with my parents.

4108
03:06:15,980 --> 03:06:17,980
I'm a basement

4109
03:06:17,980 --> 03:06:19,980
dweller. I stream from the basement.

4110
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:25,980
I have no pets.

4111
03:06:25,980 --> 03:06:27,980
I'm lonely.

4112
03:06:27,980 --> 03:06:29,980
I'll come over.

4113
03:06:29,980 --> 03:06:31,980
I'll bring my cats with me and then

4114
03:06:31,980 --> 03:06:33,980
you can have a good time.

4115
03:06:33,980 --> 03:06:35,980
Yeah, I can pet the cats unless the cats

4116
03:06:35,980 --> 03:06:37,980
hate me because sometimes they think

4117
03:06:37,980 --> 03:06:39,980
they see me and that they see that I'm

4118
03:06:39,980 --> 03:06:41,980
like visibly excited and they're like

4119
03:06:41,980 --> 03:06:43,980
not this one.

4120
03:06:43,980 --> 03:06:45,980
Oh no.

4121
03:06:45,980 --> 03:06:47,980
Boomi is very friendly. He likes everyone.

4122
03:06:47,980 --> 03:06:49,980
I'm so not used to it.

4123
03:06:49,980 --> 03:06:51,980
He's like a dog.

4124
03:06:51,980 --> 03:06:53,980
He's a big snuggly boy.

4125
03:06:53,980 --> 03:06:55,980
You have lots of pets, Kohai.

4126
03:06:55,980 --> 03:06:57,980
We're your pets.

4127
03:06:57,980 --> 03:06:59,980
Oh yeah!

4128
03:06:59,980 --> 03:07:01,980
I forgot.

4129
03:07:01,980 --> 03:07:03,980
Does that mean I'm a pet?

4130
03:07:03,980 --> 03:07:05,980
Am I Mercy's pet because I fell asleep

4131
03:07:05,980 --> 03:07:07,980
to that stream in my cage?

4132
03:07:07,980 --> 03:07:09,980
You can obby my pet.

4133
03:07:09,980 --> 03:07:11,980
I'm not used to being collared.

4134
03:07:11,980 --> 03:07:13,980
I'm the one who collars.

4135
03:07:15,980 --> 03:07:17,980
He likes pet play, Apollo.

4136
03:07:17,980 --> 03:07:19,980
Yeah, of course.

4137
03:07:21,980 --> 03:07:23,980
I'm so glad it's not like

4138
03:07:23,980 --> 03:07:25,980
a niche thing.

4139
03:07:25,980 --> 03:07:27,980
I feel like everyone kind of

4140
03:07:27,980 --> 03:07:29,980
likes pet play, right?

4141
03:07:29,980 --> 03:07:31,980
I like pet play.

4142
03:07:31,980 --> 03:07:33,980
Yeah.

4143
03:07:33,980 --> 03:07:35,980
It's nice. Do you like being the

4144
03:07:35,980 --> 03:07:37,980
pet or the owner?

4145
03:07:37,980 --> 03:07:39,980
I like being the owner.

4146
03:07:39,980 --> 03:07:41,980
Yeah, good switch.

4147
03:07:41,980 --> 03:07:43,980
I like to wear the collar and I like

4148
03:07:43,980 --> 03:07:45,980
to pull on it.

4149
03:07:45,980 --> 03:07:47,980
Some of my

4150
03:07:47,980 --> 03:07:49,980
hair members have sent me marrows

4151
03:07:49,980 --> 03:07:51,980
of them, how they bought collars recently

4152
03:07:51,980 --> 03:07:53,980
for me.

4153
03:07:53,980 --> 03:07:55,980
So they collared themselves for me and I'm like

4154
03:07:55,980 --> 03:07:57,980
hell yeah.

4155
03:07:57,980 --> 03:07:59,980
Hell yeah.

4156
03:07:59,980 --> 03:08:01,980
I love how all of us are just like

4157
03:08:01,980 --> 03:08:03,980
are just like, yes,

4158
03:08:03,980 --> 03:08:05,980
collar yourself.

4159
03:08:05,980 --> 03:08:07,980
You are mine.

4160
03:08:07,980 --> 03:08:09,980
Gosh, I love.

4161
03:08:09,980 --> 03:08:11,980
Well, ours.

4162
03:08:11,980 --> 03:08:13,980
This case.

4163
03:08:13,980 --> 03:08:15,980
Three girls abduct you

4164
03:08:15,980 --> 03:08:17,980
and make you into pets.

4165
03:08:17,980 --> 03:08:19,980
Vampire.

4166
03:08:19,980 --> 03:08:21,980
What?

4167
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:23,980
Vampire.

4168
03:08:23,980 --> 03:08:25,980
Thank you Charlie

4169
03:08:25,980 --> 03:08:27,980
for this five super jet coal.

4170
03:08:27,980 --> 03:08:29,980
Hi, I have a confession.

4171
03:08:29,980 --> 03:08:31,980
Beside this is my mythos. Oh, please don't punish me too harshly.

4172
03:08:31,980 --> 03:08:33,980
Mods chop

4173
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:35,980
his balls off.

4174
03:08:35,980 --> 03:08:37,980
Sticular

4175
03:08:39,980 --> 03:08:41,980
Corrosion.

4176
03:08:41,980 --> 03:08:43,980
Sticular.

4177
03:08:43,980 --> 03:08:45,980
I cast sticular torsion.

4178
03:08:45,980 --> 03:08:47,980
Chop chop baby.

4179
03:08:47,980 --> 03:08:49,980
Shit.

4180
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:51,980
I said, torsion or

4181
03:08:51,980 --> 03:08:53,980
corrosion, my bad.

4182
03:08:53,980 --> 03:08:55,980
Or corroding his

4183
03:08:55,980 --> 03:08:57,980
balls or no, he probably wants this.

4184
03:08:57,980 --> 03:08:59,980
Don't give him anything he wants.

4185
03:08:59,980 --> 03:09:01,980
Whatever.

4186
03:09:01,980 --> 03:09:03,980
I feel like a lot of our

4187
03:09:03,980 --> 03:09:05,980
viewers have a, what do you call it?

4188
03:09:05,980 --> 03:09:07,980
Um,

4189
03:09:07,980 --> 03:09:09,980
overlapping

4190
03:09:09,980 --> 03:09:11,980
viewers with mythos.

4191
03:09:11,980 --> 03:09:13,980
Yeah, I've noticed that.

4192
03:09:13,980 --> 03:09:15,980
It's really cool. I know some people were just like

4193
03:09:15,980 --> 03:09:17,980
really happy to hear about the collab.

4194
03:09:17,980 --> 03:09:19,980
Mythos is like,

4195
03:09:19,980 --> 03:09:21,980
everyone was like super excited for

4196
03:09:21,980 --> 03:09:23,980
mythos. They're like, I love

4197
03:09:23,980 --> 03:09:25,980
them.

4198
03:09:25,980 --> 03:09:27,980
I feel like they're us, but

4199
03:09:27,980 --> 03:09:29,980
Twitch and we're them, but

4200
03:09:29,980 --> 03:09:31,980
YouTube.

4201
03:09:35,980 --> 03:09:37,980
You get the best of both worlds.

4202
03:09:37,980 --> 03:09:39,980
I honestly thought that

4203
03:09:39,980 --> 03:09:41,980
I was, I was so nervous

4204
03:09:41,980 --> 03:09:43,980
when,

4205
03:09:43,980 --> 03:09:45,980
when, like,

4206
03:09:45,980 --> 03:09:47,980
I didn't ask for a collab and I was like,

4207
03:09:47,980 --> 03:09:49,980
fuck.

4208
03:09:49,980 --> 03:09:51,980
It was a fucking joke.

4209
03:09:51,980 --> 03:09:53,980
And that's probably what happened.

4210
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:55,980
It is probably what happened. I choked

4211
03:09:55,980 --> 03:09:57,980
on myself.

4212
03:09:57,980 --> 03:09:59,980
Only recently

4213
03:09:59,980 --> 03:10:01,980
heard of mythos. Everyone check them out.

4214
03:10:01,980 --> 03:10:03,980
They're really fun. They're beautiful.

4215
03:10:03,980 --> 03:10:05,980
Yeah. Check out the mythos girls.

4216
03:10:05,980 --> 03:10:07,980
Follow

4217
03:10:07,980 --> 03:10:09,980
on Twitter, follow them on Twitch.

4218
03:10:09,980 --> 03:10:11,980
Um, I'm definitely, oh, never mind.

4219
03:10:11,980 --> 03:10:13,980
I didn't fucking stream today because I'm like, I'll add their

4220
03:10:13,980 --> 03:10:15,980
links to my description. There's no stream

4221
03:10:15,980 --> 03:10:17,980
to be had.

4222
03:10:17,980 --> 03:10:19,980
But I'm assuming mercy will

4223
03:10:19,980 --> 03:10:21,980
probably on management do that or something.

4224
03:10:21,980 --> 03:10:23,980
They, I have their YouTube's

4225
03:10:23,980 --> 03:10:25,980
in the below, but I,

4226
03:10:25,980 --> 03:10:27,980
I follow you guys stream on

4227
03:10:27,980 --> 03:10:29,980
Twitch, right?

4228
03:10:29,980 --> 03:10:31,980
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

4229
03:10:31,980 --> 03:10:33,980
They mostly stream on the twitches.

4230
03:10:35,980 --> 03:10:37,980
I want to at least attempt to try on

4231
03:10:37,980 --> 03:10:39,980
YouTube as just, I never done it

4232
03:10:39,980 --> 03:10:41,980
before.

4233
03:10:41,980 --> 03:10:43,980
It's a unique experience.

4234
03:10:43,980 --> 03:10:45,980
It's a little bit of a learning curve,

4235
03:10:45,980 --> 03:10:47,980
but I got it. I like to play

4236
03:10:47,980 --> 03:10:49,980
the game and don't get demonetized.

4237
03:10:49,980 --> 03:10:51,980
Yeah.

4238
03:10:51,980 --> 03:10:53,980
What am I doing

4239
03:10:53,980 --> 03:10:55,980
that will give me that lovely yellow

4240
03:10:55,980 --> 03:10:57,980
side

4241
03:10:57,980 --> 03:10:59,980
was literally playing a game

4242
03:10:59,980 --> 03:11:01,980
of

4243
03:11:01,980 --> 03:11:03,980
it's that little

4244
03:11:03,980 --> 03:11:05,980
cute game

4245
03:11:05,980 --> 03:11:07,980
that's like with the puzzles

4246
03:11:07,980 --> 03:11:09,980
that goes three combining

4247
03:11:09,980 --> 03:11:11,980
and then the girls get like

4248
03:11:11,980 --> 03:11:13,980
aroused.

4249
03:11:13,980 --> 03:11:15,980
Cutie.

4250
03:11:15,980 --> 03:11:17,980
Honey pop is a hootie pop.

4251
03:11:17,980 --> 03:11:19,980
Yes. Yes. Yes. That game.

4252
03:11:19,980 --> 03:11:21,980
And she played it on

4253
03:11:21,980 --> 03:11:23,980
YouTube and there was

4254
03:11:23,980 --> 03:11:25,980
a nipslip.

4255
03:11:25,980 --> 03:11:27,980
Oh, no.

4256
03:11:27,980 --> 03:11:29,980
She screamed so loud.

4257
03:11:29,980 --> 03:11:31,980
I hope that's a clip

4258
03:11:31,980 --> 03:11:33,980
because they want to see it.

4259
03:11:35,980 --> 03:11:37,980
I think she put it on Twitter because

4260
03:11:37,980 --> 03:11:39,980
it was really funny.

4261
03:11:39,980 --> 03:11:41,980
Oh, I have to hunt that down.

4262
03:11:41,980 --> 03:11:43,980
That sounds so funny.

4263
03:11:43,980 --> 03:11:45,980
Just like that.

4264
03:11:45,980 --> 03:11:47,980
You got like the snake noise

4265
03:11:47,980 --> 03:11:49,980
when he gets caught.

4266
03:11:49,980 --> 03:11:51,980
I was just like

4267
03:11:51,980 --> 03:11:53,980
that's some balls to play that

4268
03:11:53,980 --> 03:11:55,980
game on YouTube because I was like

4269
03:11:55,980 --> 03:11:57,980
I'm pretty sure there was something

4270
03:11:57,980 --> 03:11:59,980
there. I just can't recall.

4271
03:11:59,980 --> 03:12:01,980
Markiplier played it and that's all I remember.

4272
03:12:05,980 --> 03:12:07,980
Apollo is your favorite seagull.

4273
03:12:09,980 --> 03:12:11,980
Is that a seagull?

4274
03:12:11,980 --> 03:12:13,980
Is that a seagull?

4275
03:12:13,980 --> 03:12:15,980
That sounds like you're howling.

4276
03:12:15,980 --> 03:12:17,980
I'm not going to lie to you.

4277
03:12:17,980 --> 03:12:19,980
You sound like a loon.

4278
03:12:19,980 --> 03:12:21,980
Not accurate.

4279
03:12:21,980 --> 03:12:23,980
You know, not like a loony

4280
03:12:23,980 --> 03:12:25,980
crazy person but like the bird.

4281
03:12:25,980 --> 03:12:27,980
The bird. The duck.

4282
03:12:27,980 --> 03:12:29,980
I don't know that one.

4283
03:12:29,980 --> 03:12:31,980
You should listen to it.

4284
03:12:31,980 --> 03:12:33,980
I remember. It's a very nice noise.

4285
03:12:33,980 --> 03:12:35,980
I had a friend from the UK come over

4286
03:12:35,980 --> 03:12:37,980
and then

4287
03:12:37,980 --> 03:12:39,980
I showed them the call of the loon

4288
03:12:39,980 --> 03:12:41,980
and they were like that's a wolf.

4289
03:12:41,980 --> 03:12:43,980
It does.

4290
03:12:43,980 --> 03:12:45,980
It sounds like a wolf howling sometimes.

4291
03:12:45,980 --> 03:12:47,980
You know how like grandparents

4292
03:12:47,980 --> 03:12:49,980
usually have like one animal.

4293
03:12:49,980 --> 03:12:51,980
They just have a lot of them in their house because that's like a grandparent thing.

4294
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:53,980
My grandparents had a lot of loons.

4295
03:12:53,980 --> 03:12:55,980
There's like a loon photo in the bathroom.

4296
03:12:55,980 --> 03:12:57,980
They had like wooden loons.

4297
03:12:57,980 --> 03:12:59,980
I don't...

4298
03:12:59,980 --> 03:13:01,980
My grandparents were weird people but yeah.

4299
03:13:01,980 --> 03:13:03,980
That sounds like a loon.

4300
03:13:05,980 --> 03:13:07,980
That's amazing Apollo.

4301
03:13:07,980 --> 03:13:09,980
It exists?

4302
03:13:09,980 --> 03:13:11,980
Yes. It's a grandparent thing.

4303
03:13:11,980 --> 03:13:13,980
My grandmother

4304
03:13:13,980 --> 03:13:15,980
collected roosters.

4305
03:13:15,980 --> 03:13:17,980
My great grandmother also collected roosters.

4306
03:13:17,980 --> 03:13:19,980
I guess maybe it's just my family

4307
03:13:19,980 --> 03:13:21,980
that just collects random animals

4308
03:13:21,980 --> 03:13:23,980
as their special interests.

4309
03:13:23,980 --> 03:13:25,980
You're kind of right though.

4310
03:13:25,980 --> 03:13:27,980
Mama started to collect cows

4311
03:13:27,980 --> 03:13:29,980
for a little bit and it stopped.

4312
03:13:29,980 --> 03:13:31,980
I literally had

4313
03:13:31,980 --> 03:13:33,980
my other grandmother

4314
03:13:33,980 --> 03:13:35,980
was collecting those cows.

4315
03:13:35,980 --> 03:13:37,980
I'm like why?

4316
03:13:37,980 --> 03:13:39,980
My mom does frogs.

4317
03:13:39,980 --> 03:13:41,980
That's so true.

4318
03:13:41,980 --> 03:13:43,980
Some families just have

4319
03:13:43,980 --> 03:13:45,980
like so many things.

4320
03:13:45,980 --> 03:13:47,980
I remember going to my friend's house

4321
03:13:47,980 --> 03:13:49,980
and it was all frogs.

4322
03:13:49,980 --> 03:13:51,980
Yeah.

4323
03:13:51,980 --> 03:13:53,980
Families just have like a spirit animal that collects.

4324
03:13:53,980 --> 03:13:55,980
It's their family animal.

4325
03:13:55,980 --> 03:13:57,980
That's amazing.

4326
03:13:57,980 --> 03:13:59,980
Oh my gosh guys.

4327
03:13:59,980 --> 03:14:01,980
I'm so sorry but I'm getting so tired

4328
03:14:01,980 --> 03:14:03,980
and like I haven't had breakfast.

4329
03:14:03,980 --> 03:14:05,980
Or lunch.

4330
03:14:05,980 --> 03:14:07,980
Or dinner.

4331
03:14:07,980 --> 03:14:09,980
All right. Go eat.

4332
03:14:09,980 --> 03:14:11,980
Go eat girl.

4333
03:14:11,980 --> 03:14:13,980
I'm so sorry my angels.

4334
03:14:13,980 --> 03:14:15,980
I'm going to have to end stream.

4335
03:14:15,980 --> 03:14:17,980
Okay. Bye everybody.

4336
03:14:17,980 --> 03:14:19,980
Thank you for stopping by

4337
03:14:19,980 --> 03:14:21,980
hanging out with us after.

4338
03:14:21,980 --> 03:14:23,980
Thank you so much for joining.

03:14:23,980 --> 03:14:25,980
Thank you Apollo for joining for the

03:14:25,980 --> 03:14:27,980
Yeah.

4341
03:14:27,980 --> 03:14:29,980
Letting me crash a little bit.

4342
03:14:29,980 --> 03:14:31,980
The crash. I love it.

4343
03:14:31,980 --> 03:14:33,980
I love it. Join us more.

4344
03:14:33,980 --> 03:14:35,980
Well I just shrink.

03:14:35,980 --> 03:14:37,980
So I will

4346
03:14:37,980 --> 03:14:39,980
send everyone

4347
03:14:39,980 --> 03:14:41,980
off now.

4348
03:14:41,980 --> 03:14:43,980
Is there anyone streaming right now?

4349
03:14:43,980 --> 03:14:45,980
There's no one streaming right?

4350
03:14:45,980 --> 03:14:47,980
Is Azura streaming?

4351
03:14:47,980 --> 03:14:49,980
Let me check.

4352
03:14:49,980 --> 03:14:51,980
Yeah Azura streaming. We can raid Azura.

4353
03:14:51,980 --> 03:14:53,980
Azura raid.

4354
03:14:53,980 --> 03:14:55,980
Azura Azura.

4355
03:14:55,980 --> 03:14:57,980
Say

03:14:57,980 --> 03:14:59,980

4357
03:14:59,980 --> 03:15:01,980
Milky Wilkie?

4358
03:15:01,980 --> 03:15:03,980
Say her

Yeah. Yeah. Mommy Milky Wilkie.

03:15:11,980 --> 03:15:13,980
Thank you so much everyone for joining me.

Thank you Apollo. Thank you Poseidon.

03:15:19,980 --> 03:15:21,980
allowing us to be together.

4367
03:15:21,980 --> 03:15:23,980

Okay. Bye.

See you next time.

Bye.
