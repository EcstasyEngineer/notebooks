Well, not really just woke up. I woke up not too long ago, and then I scarfed down

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,500
Mama's food and then ran down here

7
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,820
But today we're playing Omari

8
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,660
Looking kind of pale there, so does this guy on screen

9
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100

10
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,020
Ain't on controller. What did mama cook? Um

I

14
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Was very delicious

15
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,620
Have you played Omori before I have a little bit oh shoot hold on

16
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,040
It's capturing my cursor. Let's fix that

17
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Don't worry

18
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Everything is going to be okay

19
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,640
Only you're sobbing no matter what happens

20
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Promise me that will always be there

21
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
I

22
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Miss me

23
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Welcome to white space

Think I'm in the gameplay zone

30
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,520
So give me a second as I fix the capture a bit so it doesn't capture the cursor

31
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,800
Because sometimes I need my cursor on my screen, but I don't want you guys to see it

32
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
My I don't want to see my senpai see it

Papa

203
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,400
Assumes every anime is Sailor Moon or Inuyasha because of my obsession with both of them as a kid

204
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,680
Do they know you stream let's keep this between me and you senpai

00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,200
I've tried multiple times to explain what I do so senpais

217
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,320
Keep this a secret between me and you okay, I think they're happy that I'm getting a bit of money

218
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,920
Getting a bit of money now. They were so worried before

219
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Do we have a word of the day

220
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Let me choose a word

221
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,360
How about diligence hmm our word of the day is diligence. Yeah work hard

222
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Is

223
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,120
That the safe word there's no safe words around me silly it's only safe words around chibi

224
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
She she acknowledges yours

225
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
I

226
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,280
Hearing she bees hearing is selective when it comes to safe words. Yeah

227
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,280
So we don't have that okay because you're always safe with me senpai don't worry about it

228
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,360
Yeah, any time I keep all of my senpais in my basement

229
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,400
My parents are just like all these must be the new students

230
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,680
I've tried to explain multiple times every

231
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,800
Time it's gets misconstrued like any time

232
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,440
Netflix goes down they always

233
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
They're not very

234
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
They don't really know about technology, so they're like

235
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Sweetie the Netflix is down

236
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,760
Netflix is down

237
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,160
Can you call Netflix to tell them to bring it back?

238
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,920
I

239
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Yeah, sure

240
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,640
That's like give me a second I'll fix this I'll fix this

241
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,720
Usually the issue is with my my ISP

242
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
My ISP so it's not usually

243
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,640
So yeah

244
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,360
My parents are very sweet people. I love them very much and that's why I really want to be successful

245
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,960
So that I can provide for them, but also I kind of want to move out because

246
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,760
Well, you know

247
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,920
You don't really a lot of privacy when living with your parents because my time is always their time

248
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,040
So any time I tell them okay, I'm at work right now

249
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:38,360
I'm at work right now, so I can't I can't do I can't do things until maybe like until I'm done, okay?

250
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,240
They don't normally get that and sometimes will interrupt and be like

251
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,320
And so I'm just like, okay, okay, we go

252
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Honestly, they don't want me to move

253
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,640
I've been telling them like oh, yeah, I'm thinking about moving and they're like no no no no no no no no no

254
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,040
No, don't move. We need you

255
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,440
No, please don't move

256
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,680
It's so funny because um, oh my gosh, I'm so I'm I'm yapping. I'm yapping. I haven't even played the game

257
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,320
I haven't even played. I'm so sorry. I'm still yapping

258
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:42,320
When when okay, here's a fun fact about about me senpai's I worked I worked in Japan

259
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,440
I didn't at an internship or

260
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:51,800
Or um for about three months. Mm-hmm. So I lived in Japan for three months and um

261
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:02,440
And um, I was like, oh, yeah, you know, if I get a job offer here, I'll stay and

262
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,200
Mama and Papa were like if you're moving to Japan, we are moving to Japan

263
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Oh

264
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:37,800
But I really want to want my privacy because um for patreon and stuff I have to go into like a pretty much, um

265
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:46,120
Uh really a secluded room with like, uh, I put like a bunch of clothing around to to soundproof it a bit

266
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,880
It's not ideal. It's not an ideal situation

267
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,280
Yeah closet it's pretty much a closet recording

268
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:04,760
So I would really love to like one of my goals is to like move out so that I'll be able to have a space to work

269
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,680
Yeah

270
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,920
So I'm I'm trying to convince them that if I do move out, I'll I'll I'll move out

271
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,640
But I'll be I'll be really close to help them out

272
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,120
So all of my audios have been kind of like in a closet. Yeah

273
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
So don't worry about it

274
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,160
It's a little awkward. Yeah, I think I feel like it's a little awkward, but

275
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,200
um

276
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,840
I am bringing in some money so

277
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,000
So they'll be happy and as long as I'm able to pay pay off the bills and stuff

278
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,000
I think though they're pretty happy about that

279
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
like, um

280
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
For a little bit I have to ask

281
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
uh, I used to be the one

282
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,040
to pay for like gas and electricity and like utilities, but then I

283
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,200
I couldn't find a job so

284
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
So I um

285
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,160
I um, I yeah, I la

286
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,040
I had to ask them and they were so worried about about it

287
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Um

288
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,680
Did your sister escape the raft? Oh, yeah

289
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Oh, yeah, she oh, yeah, she did

290
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,600
the moment

291
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,040
um

292
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,880
the moment

293
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,320
she

294
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,080
Could get out

295
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,160
Uh, she was like, okay. I'm sending abroad

296
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,560
Bye

297
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
And she just left

298
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:02,680
No, my sister's not single. She's married trying to trying to I think she's trying to adopt

299
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:10,280
Uh adopt adopt and then I'm I was the one that was like, okay, you're stuck now

300
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,120
It was really um

301
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,720
It was really tough the job market here is pretty tough

302
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,480
Like I tried to apply to to mcdonald's and they didn't even accept me

303
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,600
Well, mostly because they wanted the morning shift and I'm allergic to eggs

304
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,000
So they didn't want to bear the responsibility for that either

305
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,400
But like a lot of places like they just they were like no we have

306
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,960
like uh here it's such a job desert that I think even the most basic, uh

307
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,240
Customer service job has over us the average here is 700

308
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Uh applicants per job

309
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
No matter what it is

310
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
You

311
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,960
So it's uh, it's hard it's been hard here

312
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
So it's it's not easy

313
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,720
Um, honestly, uh to be honest before I got the

314
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
The email for

315
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,560

317
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,920
Was in line for seven hours seven hours at a job there

318
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It was it was harsh

319
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
It was harsh. It was really harsh

320
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:53,000
No way my sister is uh, it's fine something about my sister

321
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,040
But yeah, I was so glad when I got the the call I was like, oh my gosh finally I can I can I can start providing again

322
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:21,720

A bit of privacy, um

00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,120
Uh privacy would be nice

332
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000

Sorry Cal. I only take photos of people when they least expect it

372
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,800
You like to take photos of people acting naturally when they're not in front of the camera, right basil?

373
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,680
Yeah, there's something special about everyone living on their own lives

374
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,920
These are those are the moments I want to capture

375
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,040
So like we just have to pretend you're not there

376
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,520
Yeah, I guess you can put it that way

377
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,680

00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,240
Okay, so stop downing yourself. I'm sure they'll be great

381
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,280

00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000

386
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,440
Oh Maureen Kell gave up and ran off but Aubrey and I got the hang of it real fast

387
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:06,200
Hero's still making his flower crown. It's taking him a little while, but he's getting it

388
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,720
Have to admire his persistence

389
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,960
Oh, this one's cute

390
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,280
Everyone's eating watermelon. So juicy

391
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,080
Aubrey has some seeds on her face

392
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,400
Maybe someone should tell her

393
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,360
Milk oh my gosh, Azura

394
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,360

00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:47,400
Kell drinking a bottle of milk his favorite our favorite too, right?

396
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:59,080
I shouldn't get too close or you might get my camera wet

397
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:10,200
I and had hero take a picture of us everyone thinks of our crown really suits me

398
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,480
You're all leaning in first mooch

399
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,080
Kell looks so annoyed brotherly love. Oh they're brothers

400
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,720
We're having a big day. All right, you wanted to take a picture of everyone say cheese

401
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,480
After eating everyone fell asleep. That's the link

402
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,800
I prefer vial of the blood whose blood yours, right?

403
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Can I have some mercy milk

404
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,560
How about after stream sound high

405
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,560
I'm getting kind of sleepy myself

406
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,200
Kell said he took a picture of himself on accident, but I don't believe him

407
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I

408
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Have our feet in the circle

409
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Can you guess whose feet or whose?

410
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,160
No, actually no, I'm not that good

411
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Okay, I think that's the entire album

412
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,840
Yep, that's the entire album

413
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,320
These photos are so also charming basil you really know how to capture the moment

414
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,560
Thanks, I didn't take all of them home. I like to steal my camera sometimes

415
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Only sometimes

416
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,200
Hey, I have an idea

417
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,360
Did you all want to come hang out at my house?

418
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,360
I just finished planting some little sprouts and wanted to show everyone

419
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Come on. They're really cute

420
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,840
Yeah, sure that sounds fun. Let's go

421
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,600
It's south of the playground, right? Yep, that's the way

422
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,720
I think I'll sit this one out. Y'all go and enjoy yourselves

423
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,440
But if you ever if you're ever feeling weary, you can always stop by one at one of my picnic

424
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,680
I'll have

425
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,680
some refreshments ready

426
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,400
And you can even save using my picnic basket

427
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,080
Oh, thanks Mari are always doing so much for us

428
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,400
Bye Mari. We'll see you again soon

429
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,240
Run along and have fun now. You know where to find me

430
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,000
Mari's picnic basket. Would you like to sell? Yes, I want to sell

431
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
Yeah

432
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,520
Let's look at all these things here

433
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,480
No boss zone violators will be prosecuted

434
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,280
You guys heard that no bosses here

435
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,600
Huh

436
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,760
What happened? Hold on

437
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,280
Why did it die?

438
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
I

439
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,560
Why is it doing this?

440
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:19,560
Okay, it's doing something funky the capture is doing something funky. You guys see that

441
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,440
Senpai, do you see that?

442
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,840
Yeah, we gotta call Netflix. What the heck is going on? What the heck? Hold on

443
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400
What the heck?

444
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,360
Why is it doing that?

445
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:52,680
Hmm, let's reset this uh, let's reset this for a second

446
00:53:53,480 --> 00:54:00,520
Maybe I need to make a new uh, capture. Hold on

447
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,120
I'm playing uh, I'll Mari off a PC

448
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:32,040
I'm playing it off of PC so it shouldn't be doing anything funky

449
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,480
Okay, let's try this and then we'll pull it down

450
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,840
Hopefully this stays I'll get rid of this last capture

451
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:59,960
I don't know sometimes it does weird things. Oh no, it's still doing it. Why are you doing that?

452
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,760
Why is it doing that?

453
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,760
I'm gonna have to just reset the game

454
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:20,200
Let's turn let's uh turn it on and off again

455
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:29,160
That's really weird. I've we've never had it happen before I've never had that happen before

456
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,040
Did a driver issue? I don't think so

457
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,480
Okay, looks normal

458
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,680
Hmm

459
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,440
It's still flickering funky. We'll keep an eye on it. I think

460
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
We'll keep an eye on it

461
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,680
I don't know why it's doing this though

462
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,000
Um, the reason why I'm confused about why it's doing this is because it's never done this before

463
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,360
I'm gonna swing to the moon. I tried to do that once

464
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,880
Did the game crash before when I played it it never crashed like this before

465
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,800
So I don't think and uh, I can't do a regular game capture because it's

466
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,800
Chromium based

467
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,000
So I would do a uh window capture instead

468
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So, uh

469
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,360
A window capture is that it captures a specific window

470
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,400
Usually I do a window capture, especially if a game has like a specific cut scene

471
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,120
Uh, because sometimes like uh, when you do a game capture a cut scene

472
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,360
Uh has something in it, uh, that won't get captured

473
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:16,600
But I am seeing right now that the uh game capture is flickering on in

474
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,200
like

475
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,480
A lot so I'm worried that it's it's going to be really weird because when it captures the screen

476
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,520
There's a yellow border here. Hold on. I'll explain it. There's a yellow border around

477
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,320
the uh the window

478
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,960
if it's uh

479
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:42,840
If it's capturing it but right now the yellow window like the yellow outlined is uh

480
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,440
Uh flashing so it's making me worried

481
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,640
So that's why I'm just like, hmm, are you gonna be okay?

482
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,280
I wonder if it only happens if I go to this boss thing

483
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,720
Now boss zone

484
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,520
No, I think it's fine

485
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,560
I think it's fine

486
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,040
So that's why oh, yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. Let's check

487
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,120
Early talk so fast when she's excited. It gets really hard to keep up

488
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,440
Nose is my best friend. I can't say much but she's really smart

489
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,640
Nose looks occupied

490
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,760
I like puzzles

491
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,920
I

492
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,160
You'll I hate eggs

493
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:08,200
Hey, I'm already guess what I got some plans today big plans. Just stay put for a while. You'll see what I mean soon enough

494
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Okay

495
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,280
Okay, same thing

496
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,160
I hate eggs. Hey, wait just one second. Where do you think you're going?

497
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:29,560
Can't leave without joining us for a game of hide and seek stay and play with us the more the merrier

498
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,200
You you want us you want to play hide and seek again?

499
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,920
But

500
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
You know how this turned out last time

501
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,040
Yeah, sorry barely

502
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,280
I think we're gonna have to pass

503
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,480
We're going we're going to basil's house now. So we'll catch up with you later

504
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,280
Not so fast you guys are trying to avoid me again

505
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,520
Oh

506
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,400
What's up with you two is it my face my rough and tough exterior

507
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:13,240
At least I'm not as bad as boss. It's a good thing. I banned him from the playground after what happened last time

508
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,600
Wonder what that marines up to now

509
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,200
Good riddance

510
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,480
So do you want to play hide and seek basil?

511
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,040
No, either way

512
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,040
There's no rush to get to my house after all

513
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,920
I think I'll leave it up to oh my

514
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,040

515
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,200

01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry my best friend. Come on. You know how to play hide and seek. Don't you?

518
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,360
What if I just say no

519
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,600
You don't know how to play hide and seek

520
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:16,360
What kind of kid are you anyway? That means you have to play with us. I'll explain the rules after I round up everyone

521
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,040
I was forced to do it anyways

522
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,440
Tan hot

523
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,720
All right mega tears the rules

524
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,720
We're gonna be entertaining ourselves with a little game of hide and seek

525
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,680
Here in my hands. I got some straws see everyone's gotta pick a straw

526
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,840
The one with the shortest straw is gonna be it and we'll have to find everyone else

527
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,560
Sounds easy enough, right?

528
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,280
Oh

529
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,040
I'm gonna be the one with the short straw

530
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,720
Y'all got our straws good

531
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,680
Now let's see who's gonna be it

532
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,240

01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,920
Has candy on his back

534
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,280
Well, well, well looks like the one with the shortest straw is amore

535
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,480
Oh, oh wait amore is it and amore doesn't like to be alone

536
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,920
You're gonna be okay amore

537
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,680
I can take your place if you want. I don't mind really

538
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:39,000
Hey, I hear you applauding over there. The straws make the rules not me

539
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:48,920
Come on, don't be babies. It ain't so bad amore will be fine

540
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:56,440
When you're ready to play walk up to the tether ball pole and close your eyes and no peeking or else

541
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,320
All right

Oh, you found me. I can help you find everyone else. Just don't tell Burley about this got it

545
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:35,000
Turns out there's not there's not many places to hide for a guy my size

546
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,880
I

547
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,120
But this was still fun as long as Burley is happy I'm happy

548
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,160
Those goals

549
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,120
Those goals fun goals

No skulls

554

Oh, you know, I can't stay mad at you. Let's go play patty pick

555

That's me and I was on a private beach servants fanning me on palm tree leaves on every side

565
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,920
And suddenly

582
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,240
A workout

583
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,240

It's a suspicious blue mailbox

595
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,520
Probably should stir this

596
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,640

Hey mercy do any yoyo tricks. I used to really love doing the yoyo

601
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,360
Uh, but the only thing I could do was walk the dog

602
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,200
That was it

603
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,920
You can't leave yet. I'm sorry. We haven't even one yet

604
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,640
As long as burly is happy, I'm happy

01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,720

607
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,640

613
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,520

614
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,560

615
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,560

Yawn.

642
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,560
You really gotta do this every time, barely.

643
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,560
Hey, that wasn't cool!

644
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,560
Aubrey!

645
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,560
Here I am.

646
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,560
Huh? You're spacial.

647
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,560
That's... that's strange.

648
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,560
I thought I saw him go hiding near that tree over there.

649
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,560
Basel, where are you?

650
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,560
Can you hear us?

651
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,560
Basel?

652
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,560
Come out now!

653
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,560
You already won!

654
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,560
Hello, Basel!

655
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,560
Huh?

656
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,560
Hey, there's Basel.

657
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,560
Basel, are you okay?

658
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,560
Are... are you stuck?

659
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,560
Boss, I sure didn't know it was you!

660
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,560
You're good for nothing scoundrel!

661
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,560
Let Basel go!

662
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,560
Yeah, what did Basel ever do to you?

663
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,560
Basel's our friend!

664
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,560
Don't you dare hurt him!

665
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,560
I called Basel, boss.

666
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,560
He didn't do anything wrong.

667
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,560
Whee!

668
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,560
Hehehehe!

669
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,560
Hehehehe!

670
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,560
Whee!

671
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,560
You stupid heads!

672
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,560
You think this is about Basel?

673
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,560
I did a really cute voice for Boss.

674
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,560
Don't play dumb!

675
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,560
You know why I'm here!

676
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,560
How dare you not invite me to hide and seek!

677
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,560
I'm the one who showed you all how to play in the first place!

678
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,560
You're not even playing here, right?

679
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,560
How can you call it hide and seek without any body slamming?

680
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,560
My flower crown!

681
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,560
Hey, that's the flower crown we made for Basel!

682
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,560
How could you?

683
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,560
Let go of him, you bully!

684
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,560
No!

685
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,560
If I can't play with everyone, then no one can!

686
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,560
This is a boss-only zone now!

687
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,560
And you're not invited!

688
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,560
Alright!

689
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,560
Where's my skill?

690
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,560
Sad follow-up!

691
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,560
Sure.

692
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,560
Oh, Aubrey do!

693
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,560
Skill.

694
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,560
Peptoc.

695
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,560
Here, let's do it for him.

696
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,560
Oh, Cal-do.

697
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,560
And no one.

698
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,560
You saw him!

699
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,560
Never mind.

700
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,560
Actually.

701
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,560
Attack.

702
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,560
Boss.

703
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,560
Oh, Hero-do.

704
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,560
No, Cook.

705
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,560
Ah, just attack.

706
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,560
Oh, Maury, you had a sad poem.

707
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,560
Oh, Maury felt sad.

708
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,560
Boss attacks.

709
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,560
You can do it, Aubrey!

710
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,560
Cheers on Hero!

711
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,560
You feel happy!

712
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,560
Hero attacks Boss.

713
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,560
Take 15 damage.

714
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,560
Oscar cracks his neck while Maury and friends do fight.

715
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,560
It's a boy.

716
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,560
Oh, we got nothing.

717
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,560
Maury attacks.

718
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,560
Takes 20 damage.

719
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,560
You weaklings!

720
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,560
You call that an attack?

721
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,560
Hero attacks Boss.

722
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,560
Boss takes 15 damage.

723
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,560
Aubrey attacks Boss.

724
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,560
Boss takes 17 damage.

725
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,560
Hero attacks Boss.

726
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,560
Takes 13 damage.

727
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,560
Oscar cracks his neck while friends do fight.

728
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,560
There we go.

729
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,560
Let's keep going.

730
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,560
Hey, that kind of hurt!

731
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,560
Oof!

732
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,560
This isn't fun anymore!

733
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,560
Now you've made me angry!

734
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,560
It's time for my special move!

735
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,560
Bloody slam!

736
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,560
Hero took that damage, became toast.

737
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,560
Aw, we all became toast.

738
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,560
Okay.

739
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,560
Maury did not succumb.

740
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,560
Huh?

741
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,560
How are you still moving?

742
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,560
How are you still moving?

743
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,560
Yeah.

744
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,560
Maury's party was victorious!

745
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,560
Yay!

746
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,560
He gained 32 AXP.

747
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,560
You got 22 clams.

748
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,560
Wow, we just robbed this kid too!

749
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,560
This isn't fair!

750
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,560
Rematch!

751
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,560
I want a rematch!

752
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,560
Hey, so are you hurt?

753
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,560
I'm not worrying about me.

754
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,560
I'm just fine.

755
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,560
Boss, it must hurt to see people having fun without you.

756
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,560
That doesn't mean you can ruin other people's fun.

757
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,560
Um, I know that.

758
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,560
There.

759
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,560
Does that feel better?

760
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,560
Hey, so are you sure it's okay to do that?

761
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,560
Boss is bad news!

762
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:04,560
It's a good thing Maury held on during the final attack or else we would have all been toast!

763
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,560
It's okay.

764
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,560
I trust him.

765
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:16,560
When you were all fighting, you tried really hard to make sure I didn't get hurt.

766
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,560
Is that true, boss?

767
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,560
I'm not sure.

768
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,560
Is that true, boss?

769
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,560
That's a lot of baloney.

770
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,560
I don't need to hear these lies.

771
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,560
This is my spot!

772
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,560
No one is welcome here!

773
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,560
Well, you probably won't be a problem as long as it stays like that.

774
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,560
I guess that means we can go to Basil's house now.

775
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,560
That sounds good to me.

776
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,560
We're leaving now, boss.

777
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,560
Don't cause any trouble, okay?

778
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,560
Okay, I'm ready.

779
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,560
Let's go.

780
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,560
Well, let's check in on Boss.

781
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,560
Aw, okay.

782
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,560
You're gonna swing me in the moon.

783
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,560
Come on, man, put your head in it!

784
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,560
I like puzzles.

785
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,560
I don't like if flowers is someone, but he's only interested in puzzles.

786
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,560
I don't like if I find a flower puzzle or something.

787
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,560
Maybe he would notice me.

788
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,560
Oh.

789
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,560
I might need to make more tea soon.

790
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,560
Come on, controls!

791
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,560
Controls, please let me talk!

792
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,560
Oh, friends.

793
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,560
The grass feels nice here.

794
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,560
Wanna join us, Mari?

795
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,560
Yeah.

796
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:20,560
The stars shine brightly overhead.

797
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,560
You don't have a care in the world.

798
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,560
What's my favorite tea currently?

799
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,560
My favorite tea is...

800
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,560
Peppermint vanilla.

801
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,560
Very nice.

802
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,560
Mari learned.

803
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,560
Observe.

804
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,560
Thanks, perfect nice for stargazing.

805
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,560
Banana.

806
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,560
Let me touch the banana.

807
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,560
Eternal banana.

808
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,560
Yes, yes.

809
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,560
Hello, valued customer.

810
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,560
Welcome to my shop.

811
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,560
Please buy something.

812
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,560
Candy.

813
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,560
A child's favorite food.

814
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,560
Sweet.

815
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,560
Yoast 30 heart.

816
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,560
Apple juice.

817
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,560
Apparently better than orange juice.

818
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,560
Yoast 25 juice.

819
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,560
Jax, Yoast is small damage to offals and reduces their speed.

820
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,560
Crescent is not what you wanted and flicks anger on a friend or a foal.

821
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,560
I guess I can buy some apple juice.

822
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,560
I'll buy apple juice.

823
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,560
Thank you kindly.

824
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,560
Candy.

825
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,560
And I think I have enough for Jax as well.

826
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,560
There you go.

827
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,560
Whatever.

828
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,560
Did you see the shippity guitar I see made?

829
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,560
Yeah, I did.

830
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,560
It was cute.

831
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,560
Hop.

832
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,560
And a hop.

833
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,560
And a hop.

834
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,560
And a hop.

835
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,560
And a hop.

836
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,560
Having fun takes too much effort to watch my friends have fun is enough for me.

837
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,560
Peek-a-boo.

838
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,560
I like puzzles.

839
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,560
Come on, man.

840
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,560
Put your head into it.

841
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,560
No, this isn't my best friend.

842
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,560
She can't say much, but she's really smart.

843
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,560
No, this looks occupied.

844
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,560
Okay.

845
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,560
Hey, Mori.

846
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,560
How are you all doing?

847
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,560
Just the other day, Noelle was telling me about a cute little leaf she met.

848
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:48,560
But she tried to be its friend and all I wanted to talk about was how much it hated bunnies.

849
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,560
How could someone hate bunnies?

850
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,560
I just don't understand some people.

851
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,560
Yes, some nutritious candy.

852
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,560
Do you like to eat some?

853
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,560
You and your friend feel alike now.

854
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,560
You want to have a picnic with your friends?

855
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,560
No.

856
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,560
Not yet.

857
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,560
Train station.

858
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,560
Can you move forward?

859
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,560
It's Basel's house.

860
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,560
Maybe we should go to Basel's first?

861
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,560
Okay.

862
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,560
Basel's house.

863
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,560
Maybe we should go to Basel's first?

864
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,560
Oh.

865
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,560
Watering can.

866
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,560
These are sunflowers.

867
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,560
I call that because they always face towards the sun.

868
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,560
That's how I want to be like.

869
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,560
Someone who can always see.

870
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,560
Someone who always sees the bright side of things.

871
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:50,560
Watering can.

872
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,560
These flowers are called the Lillian of the Valley.

873
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,560
It's said that they're able to ward off evil spirit and help people see a brighter future.

874
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,560
I guess that's why they remind me of mine.

875
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,560
I can always count on her to help me stay positive.

876
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,560
What is that?

877
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,560
Whoa!

878
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,560
What's that ugly plant creature?

879
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,560
Don't you know, Cal?

880
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,560
That's a sprout mole.

881
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,560
Sprout moles are highly intelligent creatures.

882
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,560
They also become dangerously vicious when they are lost.

883
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,560
Please, Mr. Sprout Mole, stop that.

884
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,560
You're stopping all over the flowers.

885
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,560
It looks like the sprout mole is angry.

886
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,560
Like us, sprout moles can also feel emotions.

887
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,560
If the sprout mole is angry, its attack is higher.

888
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,560
On the other hand, its lower, its defense.

889
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,560
Well, what you're saying is now is the perfect time to strike.

890
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,560
Come on, Amore. Let's do this.

891
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,560
Why not?

892
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,560
We're just gonna kick its ass.

893
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,560
Oh.

894
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:12,560
Okay, that wasn't bad.

895
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,560
You gained 22 EXP, got three clams.

896
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,560
You found tofu.

897
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,560
Amore grew to level two.

898
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,560
Most of the flowers are unharmed.

899
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,560
That's a relief.

900
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,560
Hey, Amore.

901
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,560
We're getting into the hang of battle.

902
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,560
Here's a journal where we can keep track of any neat foals we come across.

903
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,560
Nero gave you the full facts journal.

904
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,560
There, now it's in your pocket.

905
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,560
The journal is yours to record with.

906
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,560
Oh, we might pitch in sometimes too.

907
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,560
Check it out through your pocket or in the player menu by the pressing B.

908
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,560
By pressing B.

909
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,560
Alright.

910
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,560
Okay.

911
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,560
Important.

912
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,560
Full facts.

913
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,560
Views.

914
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,560
A sprout mole.

915
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,560
A dangerous and hostile, ugly plant creature.

916
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,560
It says it's smart, but they do not believe it is.

917
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,560
But do not believe it is not.

918
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,560
It smells like dirty laundry.

919
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,560
Amore.

920
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,560
Alright.

921
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,560
Another one!

922
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,560
Oh no, not again.

923
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,560
Please, Mr. Sprout, don't stop twirling.

924
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,560
You're destroying all of the flowers.

925
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,560
Oh, I see.

926
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,560
This sprout mole is happy.

927
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,560
In that case, it has a higher chance to hit our weak spots and do more damage.

928
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,560
This also means it has a high chance of missing.

929
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,560
Oh.

930
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:16,560
Amore's party was victorious.

931
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,560
You got four clams, bountiful.

932
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,560
Oh, sorry.

933
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,560
I'm going to just adjust some stuff.

934
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,560
Hmm.

935
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,560
You seem to be running a lot of foals with emotion.

936
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,560
In case you didn't know, emotions can determine how strong or weak the attack is.

937
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,560
Happy beats angry.

938
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,560
Angry beats sad.

939
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,560
And sad beats happy.

940
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,560
That's depressing!

941
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,560
That's depressing!

942
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,560
Here, I even drew up a guide on how it works.

943
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,560
I'm no artist, but I think it will get to the point.

944
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,560
I'll put it in your pocket so you can check it out later.

945
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,560
Got a motion chart.

946
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:58,560
You want to look at that motion chart now?

947
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,560
Yeah.

948
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,560
Oh wait, that's cute.

949
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,560
Sad, defense up speed town.

950
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:10,560
Some damage to heart becomes juice.

951
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,560
Angry equals attack up and defense down.

952
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,560
Happy is luck up, speed up, and rate down.

953
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,560
Strong to sad and strong to happy.

954
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,560
Happy's weak to strong.

955
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,560
Strong.

956
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:31,560
Angry is strong to sad and sad is weak to angry.

957
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,560
Happy is strong to angry.

958
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,560
And angry is weak to happy.

959
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,560
And neutral is just in the middle.

960
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,560
Yeah, I'm not an artist, but this is pretty cute, yeah.

961
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,560
I want to look at the other flowers.

962
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,560
These type of flowers are called gladiose.

963
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,560
Gladiose, gladiolus.

964
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:01,560
Wow, I can't read!

965
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,560
I can't read!

966
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,560
Is the gladiolus what?

967
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:12,560
Gladiolus, also known as the sword flower.

968
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,560
As you might guess, it represents a strength of character.

969
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,560
A woman who is honest with strong moral values.

970
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:23,560
Someone who stands by the conviction that gladiolus reminds me of Aubrey

971
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,560
because she's always true to herself.

972
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,560
Oh, I see.

973
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,560
But you're saying that Aubrey is really stubborn!

974
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,560
Hey, no I'm not!

975
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,560
Okay, let's move on.

976
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,560
These are roses.

977
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,560
Can you guess who they remind me of?

978
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,560
They remind me of Hero.

979
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:46,560
Can you guess correctly?

980
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:51,560
Roses come in many different colors and have their own unique meanings.

981
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,560
Pink roses represent...

982
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,560
Oh, symbolize is admiration.

983
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,560
Orange roses symbolize passion.

984
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,560
Yellow roses symbolize friendship.

985
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,560
The list goes on.

986
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,560
Hero doesn't remind me of any rose in particular.

987
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,560
Like, heroes like all roses because he's versatile and universally loved.

988
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,560
Oh, that's really sweet.

989
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:14,560
You got, like, so many, so many flowers based off of your friends.

990
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,560
Whoa, what are these flowers called?

991
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,560
They're all cool and spiky!

992
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,560
I should tell.

993
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,560
This is the cactus.

994
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,560
It's more of a plant than a flower.

995
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,560
It's funny that you ask because they remind you of you.

996
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,560
Is it because he's a prick?

997
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,560
Hey!

998
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:42,560
Well, not too, but mostly because cactus are very sturdy and resilient plants by nature.

999
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,560
I can't believe!

1000
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,560
I can't believe!

1001
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,560
They were like, yeah, it's because you're a prick.

1002
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:04,560
That too.

1003
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:09,560
They don't need much care and can survive even in seemingly impossible conditions.

1004
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,560
Guess what I'm saying is that even you could take care of a cactus, Cal.

1005
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,560
Whoa, neat!

1006
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,560
Cacti are awesome!

1007
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:23,560
Did not even notice the inson there.

1008
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,240
Ah, these are twice tulips.

1009
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,240
They are simple and bulbous.

1010
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,560
Just like a mori.

1011
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,440
Bul- bulb- bulbus?

1012
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,560
Bulbas?

1013
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,240
Water's off a duck's back?

1014
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,200
Exactly like Shibi.

1015
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,560
Shibi's, like, so strong.

1016
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,560
Everything is water off a duck's back.

1017
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:59,560
I don't know, I just think it's cute.

1018
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,560
Oh, Basil, you think I'm cute?

1019
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,560
Uh-huh.

1020
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,560
Ah, not another sprout, Mo.

1021
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,560
Not good, Basil.

1022
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,560
We gotta hang him this by now.

1023
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:25,560
Hmm, this sprout mo seemed a bit sad.

1024
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,560
See how it's curled up in the fetal position?

1025
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,560
That means it won't do as much damage as normal.

1026
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,560
But it'll also take less damage to heart and will lose juice instead.

1027
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:38,560
How sad.

1028
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,560
Let's put it out of its misery.

1029
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,560
Alright?

1030
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,560
Hmm.

1031
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,560
Okay.

1032
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,560
I'm gonna just keep on attacking, whatever.

1033
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:21,560
I'm just like, oh wow, this thing is depressed?

1034
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,560
Kill it.

1035
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,560
Alright.

1036
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,560
Alright.

1037
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:59,560
Oh, how'd you get here so fast, Mari?

1038
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,560
Hi everyone, y'all just came in time for a lovely picnic.

1039
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,560
Feel free to rest here.

1040
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:12,560
Everything is already all set up and I even brought some fruit.

1041
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,560
Alright.

1042
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,560
Let's have a picnic with our friends.

1043
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,560
Cute.

1044
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,560
Delicious fruit, would you like to eat some?

1045
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:38,560
I mean, your friends feel like new.

1046
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,560
Munch, munch, munch, munch.

1047
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,560
Whoa, thanks, Mari, you're the best.

1048
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,560
Oh, it's nothing.

1049
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:48,560
I'm gonna look out for all of you.

1050
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,560
Ah, Mari, I wish it could be more like you.

1051
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,560
You always seem to have everything under control.

1052
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,560
That's not true at all.

1053
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,560
It just seems that way from the outside.

1054
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,560
Either way, you sure seem to make everything look easy.

1055
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,560
Yes, I agree.

1056
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,560
Mari is effortlessly graceful.

1057
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,560
Don't you think so, Mari?

1058
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,560
Oh, Mari, stop kidding around.

1059
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:22,560
Is there any way to treat your big sister?

1060
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,560
I have straight down this way.

1061
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,560
Are we all ready to go?

1062
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,560
I'm ready when you are.

1063
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,560
I'll catch you later, Mari.

1064
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,560
Let me know if you need anything.

1065
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,560
You soon.

1066
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,560
Well, let's see if we can save here.

1067
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:55,560
I want to say no because I was like, nah.

1068
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,560
It's the same thing.

1069
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,560
Oh, shoot, I'm going the wrong direction.

1070
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,560
I wanted to see before we go to Basil's house

1071
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,560
if there's anything on the other areas

1072
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,560
or if they're just blocked off, too.

1073
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,560
Give us a second.

1074
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:21,560
I feel like Basil's house is actually like a final area,

1075
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,560
so I'm just going to check.

1076
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,560
Mari, we're supposed to go to my house.

1077
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,560
Let's just pass the cell.

1078
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:31,560
And let's finish finding some little sprouts

1079
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,560
and why don't you show everyone?

1080
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,560
Come on, they're really cute.

1081
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:38,560
Transportation station doesn't seem to be in service.

1082
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,560
Okay, well, I guess we'll go to your house.

1083
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,560
Never mind, I wanted to find the little puzzle,

1084
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,560
but okay, it's fine.

1085
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,560
It's fine.

1086
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,560
Get back over here.

1087
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,560
Thank you.

1088
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,560
Okay, we saved already, so it's fine.

1089
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,560
Let's just go.

1090
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,560
What is that?

1091
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,560
What the hecky-wecky?

1092
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:38,560
What emotion is this feeling, Engie?

1093
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,560
What emotion is this feeling, Engie?

1094
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,560
What emotion is this feeling, Engie?

1095
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,560
What was...

1096
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,560
What was this feeling, Engie?

1097
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,560
No.

1098
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,560
Why do you like major damage?

1099
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,560
Help.

1100
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,560
Oh.

1101
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,560
Yeah.

1102
01:39:39,560 --> 01:40:05,560
I really couldn't tell what emotions I was feeling.

1103
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:23,560
Oh man, this fight is pretty tough.

1104
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:26,560
Don't worry, we can do this if we work together.

1105
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,560
Looks like I'm going to have to teach you all a little bit about teamwork.

1106
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,560
Let's try it again, Amore.

1107
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:37,560
We'll get him this time.

1108
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,560
You notice anything different, Amore?

1109
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:43,560
You should see a new bar at the bottom of the screen with the number on the side.

1110
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,560
It's our collective energy.

1111
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:48,560
By using our energy, we can beat this ball together.

1112
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,560
Just attack and you'll see.

1113
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,560
Like this.

1114
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,560
It...

1115
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,560
Hold on.

1116
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,560
You see the bubble that popped up when we attacked?

1117
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:28,560
That's called follow-up.

1118
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:34,560
If you attack for a limited time, you can use energy to perform a follow-up.

1119
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,560
Press any direction...

1120
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,560
Direction or arrow and see what happens.

1121
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,560
Alright?

1122
01:41:48,560 --> 01:42:05,560
No, why didn't it work?

1123
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,560
Huh.

1124
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,560
That cost three energy.

1125
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,560
Oh, I see.

1126
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,560
Ew.

1127
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,560
Man, this guy's really tough.

1128
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,560
When you attack this, did you notice that our energy went up?

1129
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:20,560
When we take damage, we can also gain energy.

1130
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,560
Think of it as a chance to make a comeback.

1131
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,560
Alright.

1132
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:54,560
Okay, so cost three, so that's why they're not...

1133
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,560
Okay.

1134
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,560
Nice, we're full of energy.

1135
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:04,560
Every time we use our special attack, Mari, after you attack, press to release energy.

1136
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,560
Okay, it's the... this button?

1137
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,560
Okay.

1138
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:08,560
Up here already?

1139
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:09,560
Come on, everyone.

1140
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,560
Show this big guy what we're made of.

1141
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:34,560
Did I do the wrong one?

1142
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,560
Oh, I pressed the wrong one.

1143
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,560
It was down.

1144
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,560
Oops.

1145
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,560
I thought when I said press the directional button, I was like, okay, I just pressed the

1146
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:44,560
directional button because it's pressable.

1147
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:49,560
Not bad.

1148
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:53,560
Whatever, I can do it again.

1149
01:43:53,560 --> 01:44:03,560
My bad.

1150
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:15,560
That was my bad.

1151
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:21,560
Whatever.

1152
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,560
Learn stab him.

1153
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,560
Operate group to three, level three.

1154
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:33,560
Hero group to level three, yeah.

1155
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,560
And there you have it.

1156
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,560
Geralt's battle tutorial 101.

1157
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:42,560
And I'm sure that we fight more battles, our team work will improve over time.

1158
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,560
Oh, you guys, that was so amazing.

1159
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,560
Yeah, that was nothing.

1160
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,560
I could have taken...

1161
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,560
I could have taken away better gear guys than that.

1162
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:55,560
I should teach you some of my skills one of those days.

1163
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,560
Basil, I know you're not the type that likes to fight, but it's good to know how to defend

1164
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,560
yourself, too.

1165
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,560
You know, I've actually been working on a book all about battles.

1166
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,560
Maybe we can all study together next time.

1167
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,560
I'll give it to Omori to hold on for now.

1168
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:18,560
I'm just the pack mule, hey?

1169
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:24,560
Yes, we get stronger, I'll be updating the follow-up section of the self-help guide,

1170
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,560
so you should just check it out every now and then.

1171
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:34,560
Omori, you should know when we gain EXP and level up, sometimes we also learn skill.

1172
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,560
Skills are powerful and have a wide range of effects, but each of us can only remember

1173
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,560
up to four skills at a time.

1174
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:45,560
After you learn a new skill, don't forget to equip it from the player menu, okay?

1175
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,560
Yeah, yeah, we know.

1176
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:49,560
We got a Basil's house now.

1177
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:51,560
Okay, that's all I had to say.

1178
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,560
Ah, Patience Kale.

1179
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,560
Kale?

1180
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,560
Kale?

1181
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:57,560
I'm calling him Kale.

1182
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:05,560
There was an old lady who lived in a shoe.

1183
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,560
What was that nursery rhyme again?

1184
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,560
I totally forgot.

1185
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:17,560
Hey, cheese!

1186
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:22,560
Hold on, let me look it up.

1187
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,560
Let me look it up.

1188
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:29,560
Oh, lady who lived...

1189
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:31,560
Okay.

1190
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,560
Okay, let's see.

1191
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,560
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.

1192
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,560
She had so many children she didn't know what to do.

1193
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,560
She gave them some broth and a big slice of bread.

1194
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,560
She kissed them all soundly and sent them to bed.

1195
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,560
There you go.

1196
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:53,560
Do you guys know that nursery rhyme?

1197
01:46:53,560 --> 01:47:07,560
That's not the version you know.

1198
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:11,560
What version did you have now?

1199
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,560
Well, it came out kind of blurry.

1200
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,560
Well, it's okay, it gives character.

1201
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,560
If you don't mind the photo.

1202
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:20,560
Of course we don't mind, I won't see it.

1203
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,560
Oh, sure thing.

1204
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,560
Y'all look so cute!

1205
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:30,560
Now's my hair.

1206
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:37,560
I wanna see, I wanna see!

1207
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:42,560
Oh, hey Amari, you wanna look at the photo too?

1208
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:51,560
Yeah, it is blurry.

1209
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,560
Whip them all soundly and pop them to bed is the one I know.

1210
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:58,560
Oh, okay, okay, I guess.

1211
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,560
Okay, okay, I...

1212
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:04,560
Okay, well that one's a little darker.

1213
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:10,560
I definitely learned the version I just read.

1214
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:12,560
See how it came out kind of blurry?

1215
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,560
But you can...

1216
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,560
But y'all still look so cute.

1217
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,560
I should add it to my collection.

1218
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:25,560
Oh, woohoo, another shot for the full album.

1219
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:27,560
Oh, Wolver, Amari, I can't see.

1220
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,560
Hey, stop pushing!

1221
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,560
You already had your turn!

1222
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,560
Get out of my way, Cal!

1223
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:36,560
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, there's no need to fight.

1224
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:37,560
Me first!

1225
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:39,560
No, me!

1226
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,560
Ah, stop it!

1227
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:45,560
You guys are knocking me over.

1228
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,560
Uh, oops.

1229
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,560
Oh my gosh, Basel!

1230
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,560
Basel, we're so sorry!

1231
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,560
You okay, Basel?

1232
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,560
You two are in big trouble now.

1233
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,560
This is why both of you need to learn how to get along.

1234
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:08,560
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, hero.

1235
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,560
Please don't tell Amari.

1236
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,560
It's okay, don't worry about it.

1237
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,560
Accidents happened.

1238
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,560
Here's your photos.

1239
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,560
It doesn't look like any of them got damaged.

1240
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,560
Let's put them back in your photo album together.

1241
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,560
You hero?

1242
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,560
Let's go inside my house first.

1243
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,560
Remember to wipe your feet before you come in.

1244
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:44,560
Everybody, wipe your feet before you go in, okay?

1245
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:50,560
Wait a second, hold on.

1246
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,560
Is there anything around here?

1247
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,560
Anything special? No.

1248
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,560
Okay, we just go in though.

1249
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,560
Wipe your feet!

1250
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,560
You guys wiping?

1251
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,560
Zephyze, wipe your feet!

1252
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,560
Basel's photo album.

1253
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,560
It's the most precious belonging.

1254
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,560
Are you ready to put the photo?

1255
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:13,560
Put back the photos Amari?

1256
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:14,560
Yeah.

1257
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,560
Yeah, let's get started.

1258
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,560
I don't think I remember the order of these photos.

1259
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,560
No, I'm not a thing, Basel.

1260
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:27,560
Amari has really good memories, I'm sure.

1261
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,560
We'll figure this out in no time.

1262
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,560
Lies in me!

1263
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,560
Oh.

1264
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,560
I think it was this one.

1265
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,560
Or not, hold on.

1266
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,560
Wait, no, I need to put it back!

1267
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:09,560
I wanted to...

1268
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,560
Okay.

1269
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,560
Is that correct?

1270
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,560
Basel's memory.

1271
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,560
There, it's new.

1272
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,560
Really sorry for pushing you over, Basel.

1273
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,560
Even though at least half of it was Kels' fault.

1274
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,560
Yeah, I promise.

1275
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:41,560
Never to ever, to never fall for it.

1276
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,560
I'm sorry.

1277
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:45,560
I'm sorry.

1278
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:47,560
I'm sorry.

1279
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,560
I'm sorry.

1280
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:53,560
Ever, to never fight with Aubrey ever again, unless she starts this first.

1281
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:57,560
No worry about it.

1282
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:01,560
I know you only wanted to see my photo album.

1283
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:04,560
Thank you for helping me put it back together.

1284
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,560
That's strange.

1285
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,560
Photo must have been loose.

1286
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,560
Huh? What's this?

1287
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,560
Can I take this photo?

1288
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,560
Something about it seems...

1289
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,560
...well familiar.

1290
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,560
No, no.

1291
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,560
I can't be.

1292
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,560
My face!

1293
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,560
Huh?

1294
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,560
Meow?

1295
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,560
What do you do around here, is there?

1296
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,560
Get you a box for wiping your sorrows away.

1297
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,560
Your sketchbook.

1298
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,560
Take a look inside.

1299
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:00,560
You only got...

1300
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,560
Oh, what the heck is that? That's new.

1301
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,560
You booted up your laptop.

1302
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,560
What'd you like to do?

1303
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,560
Look at your screen.

1304
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,560
Let's share it at the screen.

1305
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,560
In your journal.

1306
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,560
Everything? Okay.

1307
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,560
The heat from the laptop warmed your lap.

1308
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,560
It felt nice.

1309
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,560
Meow?

1310
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,560
Meow? Or is there?

1311
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,560
For a way out?

1312
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,560
There's one.

1313
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,560
But...

1314
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,560
Meow? Waiting for something to happen?

1315
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,560
Light bulb hangs from the ceiling.

1316
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,560
Wherever it is.

1317
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,560
Looking for light bulb?

1318
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:27,560
It's black inside.

1319
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,560
You can't see a thing.

1320
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,560
Cow!

1321
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,560
Oh, what?

1322
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,560
Cat?

1323
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,560
What do you say?

1324
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,560
Something you do?

1325
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,560
I would just ignore it.

1326
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,560
But...

1327
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:11,560
when all those red things, they're like cans

1328
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:13,560
and it brings you back to the beginning.

1329
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:32,560
Oh, there's more of them.

1330
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:56,560
I can't remember.

1331
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:25,560
Oh, there's more.

1332
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:34,560
Huh.

1333
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:52,560
Kat, tell me what the fuck I need to do.

1334
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,560
What's my charm?

1335
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:14,560
What do I need to like?

1336
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:43,560
Never mind.

1337
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:46,560
There's a stab one here.

1338
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,560
Dab? Who? Stab me?

1339
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,560
Okay.

1340
01:57:51,560 --> 01:58:05,560
Okay.

1341
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:17,560
Ow.

1342
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:19,560
Are you gonna take it? Yeah?

1343
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:28,560
Look at all of us.

1344
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:40,560
There are all our memories together.

1345
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:47,560
They're a little sad now.

1346
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:52,560
But we should be happy that they happened at all.

1347
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:55,560
Oh, Zerah's in chat?

1348
01:58:55,560 --> 01:59:20,560
Let's make some new memories together, okay?

1349
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,560
You see a boy sleeping in his room.

1350
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:26,560
What's his name?

1351
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:31,560
You guys want to be sunny?

1352
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:36,560
I guess we got a default name.

1353
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:43,560
Or should I go for a regular?

1354
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:49,560
Regular name. You guys want to be...

1355
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:51,560
Does my senpai want to be...

1356
01:59:51,560 --> 02:00:04,560
You want to be senpai? Okay.

1357
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,560
That's uppercase senpai.

1358
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,560
S

1359
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:11,560
E

1360
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,560
N

1361
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,560
D

1362
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:17,560
A

1363
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:23,560
I

1364
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,560
The boy's name is senpai?

1365
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:45,560
Yeah.

1366
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:47,560
Hey senpai, it's mommy.

1367
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:51,560
I'm still in the city setting things up for our new home.

1368
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,560
Did you finish packing yet?

1369
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:55,560
Movers are going to be at our house in a few days,

1370
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:58,560
so I left a list of things for you to do before they arrive.

1371
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:00,560
Oh, so sorry. Mommy messed up.

1372
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,560
I forgot to tell you the electric company

1373
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:05,560
that we need a few extra days before we're ready to move,

1374
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,560
so the lights might be cut out sometime tonight.

1375
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:12,560
Anyway, I know moving to a new place can be a little nerve-wracking right now,

1376
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:17,560
but I think a change of scenery will be positive for both of us.

1377
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:19,560
I know you haven't talked to anyone in a while,

1378
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:22,560
but you might want to say goodbye to your old friends before we leave.

1379
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,560
How's it going to have... has been really...

1380
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:28,560
I've been really... that's what I can't read right now.

1381
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:35,560
How's it been trying really hard to get ahold of you

1382
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:38,560
ever since we put our house up for sale?

1383
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:41,560
He's been calling us every week for the past few months.

1384
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:43,560
He seems a little lonely.

1385
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,560
Maybe he should pay him a visit.

1386
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:47,560
Okay, that's it for now.

1387
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:50,560
Mommy loves you. Bye, honey.

1388
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:52,560
Zzz.

1389
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,560
You are hungry.

1390
02:01:58,560 --> 02:01:59,560
An old computer.

1391
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:01,560
A bunch of books.

1392
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:06,560
Cardboard boxes littered across the house.

1393
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:09,560
Or a drope.

1394
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:12,560
An ordinary house plan. Nothing special about it.

1395
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:14,560
Table lamp.

1396
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:21,440
Mums, do you know- Hi senpai, this is a note from mommy.

1397
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:24,640
I left some food in this fridge for you downstairs.

1398
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:26,240
It's steak, your favorite.

1399
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:27,240
Love you!

1400
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:30,240
Hugs and kisses.

1401
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:33,240
Mums, to-do list.

1402
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:40,560
I don't feel like doing chores right now.

1403
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:44,560
A bathtub.

1404
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,560
It's me.

1405
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:50,560
Hi senpai, this is a note from mommy.

1406
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,560
Remember to brush your teeth every day.

1407
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:54,560
Love you!

1408
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,560
Hugs and kisses.

1409
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,560
Towels and toiletries.

1410
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,560
Toilet.

1411
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:00,560
Haha, it's shibby!

1412
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,560
I mean-

1413
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,560
She's gonna fucking kill me.

1414
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:11,560
She's gonna fucking kill me.

1415
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:21,560
She's gonna fucking kill me.

1416
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:27,560
No, don't tell Ezra!

1417
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,560
She's gonna fucking kill me.

1418
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:34,560
Are you not here for me for a few days?

1419
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:35,560
Yeah.

1420
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:38,560
I'm trapped in Wonderland, okay?

1421
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:41,560
Hahaha!

1422
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:55,560
This is ma, a big houseland.

1423
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:00,560
One of two old grandfather couples.

1424
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:03,560
They stopped working a long time ago, but mom likes to keep them around.

1425
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:08,560
What case has been cleared out?

1426
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,560
A nary houseplant.

1427
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,560
Nothing special, wow.

1428
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,560
About it.

1429
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:15,560
Yeah!

1430
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:21,560
Yeah, I feel like shibby is gonna kill me.

1431
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:24,560
She's gonna fucking murder me.

1432
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,560
I mean, I'll hear me for a week.

1433
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,560
You know why?

1434
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,560
I'll come back, though.

1435
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:34,560
I'll just get, I'll get Emmy to bring me back.

1436
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,560
I'll get Emmy to bring me back.

1437
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,560
That's no problem.

1438
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,560
Carver box is littered across the house.

1439
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,560
This empty picnic basket.

1440
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,560
Would you like to save?

1441
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,560
Yeah.

1442
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:52,560
Oh, now I'm colored in.

1443
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,560
Some family photos.

1444
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:58,560
Carver boxes are littered across the house.

1445
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:04,560
Mom said, the mattress is too hard for you to sleep comfortably.

1446
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,560
It's fine, it's fine.

1447
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:17,560
Probably.

1448
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:20,560
Are you sure you want to go downstairs?

1449
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:23,560
What do you mean, are you sure?

1450
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:25,560
I checked everything up here, right?

1451
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:27,560
No?

1452
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:29,560
Is there things I didn't see?

1453
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:33,560
Okay, well, sure, whatever.

1454
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:40,560
What, no?

1455
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:42,560
Why not?

1456
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,560
Ah, metal!

1457
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,560
Metal!

1458
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:47,560
Metal's ringing!

1459
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:02,560
Hi Raiders, welcome!

1460
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:05,560
Welcome to the stream!

1461
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:09,560
Metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal!

1462
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:12,560
Metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal!

1463
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:17,560
Welcome, metal!

1464
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,560
Welcome, metal, from UMAP Plus!

1465
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:32,560
Welcome to the stream!

1466
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:38,560
Wow, have you guys checked out metal yet?

1467
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:40,560
UMAP Plus girls are so cute.

1468
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,560
Cute, cute, cute, cute, cute.

1469
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,560
Welcome Raiders!

1470
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:46,560
Hello Raiders!

1471
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,560
Welcome to the stream!

1472
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:48,560
I'm playing Amore right now.

1473
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,560
My name is MercyModees from VLRs.

1474
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:54,560
Gen 1 Indulge!

1475
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:55,560
Welcome to the stream!

1476
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:58,560
I really appreciate Metal bringing you in.

1477
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,560
Meryl, what did you play?

1478
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:03,560
Or what did you do?

1479
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:11,560
I'm so glad, thank you!

1480
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:16,560
I played Zero Escape.

1481
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:20,560
Oh my gosh, I love the Nonary series.

1482
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:24,560
I'm bad at numbers, but I love the Nonary series.

1483
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:29,560
When I first got nine persons, nine doors, nine hours,

1484
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:31,560
I don't remember the order it was in.

1485
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:35,560
I literally thought I only had nine hours to complete it.

1486
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,560
So I was like putting it off for a while.

1487
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,560
Turns out, you know, that's just the story

1488
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:47,560
and I didn't actually need only nine hours to play

1489
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:50,560
when I played it on DS.

1490
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:53,560
I got it gifted by a friend.

1491
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:58,560
That's like, oh no!

1492
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:01,560
Oh my gosh, I thought, oh my god, no,

1493
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:03,560
I thought the escape parts were time to nine,

1494
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:06,560
but it's two, me too!

1495
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:16,560
Me too, I thought, I thought I only had nine,

1496
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:19,560
like literally nine hours to just do it.

1497
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:23,560
So it was rough.

1498
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:24,560
It was rough times.

1499
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,560
But yeah, I'm glad, I'm glad.

1500
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,560
Are you pretty far into it?

1501
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:31,560
It's such a fun game.

1502
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:33,560
It's such a fun game.

1503
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:34,560
I've completed the entire series,

1504
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,560
so I don't think I'll stream it.

1505
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:40,560
But if you guys want to check out the Nonary's Zero Escape,

1506
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:44,560
check out Merrill playing it.

1507
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:45,560
It's probably fun.

1508
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:46,560
It's probably lots of fun.

1509
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,560
I think it's lots of fun.

1510
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:50,560
I said probably because I was nervous,

1511
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:52,560
some pies would be like, oh, I don't know.

1512
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:54,560
Puzzle games, that's not my thing.

1513
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,560
But guess what? Puzzle games are my thing.

1514
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,560
I'm a second game now.

1515
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:00,560
It's been big fun so far.

1516
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:01,560
Yeah!

1517
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,560
Did you stream the first game too?

1518
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,560
I'm sure people would love to see a lot of it.

1519
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:13,560
Mercy, have you played Ibb?

1520
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:14,560
Yeah, I played Ibb.

1521
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,560
Not the new one, where they extended a lot of stuff,

1522
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:21,560
but like the old one.

1523
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,560
When it was free.

1524
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:26,560
When Ibb was free, I played it when it was free.

1525
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,560
Like a long, long time ago.

1526
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,560
I did, yeah, I finished the first one on stream.

1527
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:33,560
Yeah, everybody go check that out, okay?

1528
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:34,560
Check out the first one,

1529
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:38,560
and then check out the playthrough for Merrill's one.

1530
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,560
Yeah, I love puzzle games.

1531
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:41,560
It's so fun.

1532
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:43,560
Thank you so much for the raid once again.

1533
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,560
I really appreciate it.

1534
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,560
Right now, we gotta figure out

1535
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:49,560
how to go down the stairs.

1536
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:50,560
I have some studying to do.

1537
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:53,560
I'll be looking to have a big fun stream, Mercy.

1538
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:55,560
Okay, good luck with your study.

1539
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:58,560
Work hard and get those grades up.

1540
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:00,560
A plus all around.

1541
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:06,560
Wee!

1542
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:09,560
And now the rest of you are with me.

1543
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:16,560
Yeah, I'm winking, but you can't tell

1544
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:21,560
because I am wearing an eye patch.

1545
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:25,560
So let's continue.

1546
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:29,560
So, can I not go downstairs?

1547
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:43,560
Hmm.

1548
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:50,560
Isn't the beach this bathtub?

1549
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:58,560
I feel like I literally have gone through everything.

1550
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,560
Why not?

1551
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:01,560
Get your ass down there.

1552
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:03,560
Close your eyes.

1553
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:09,560
You feel dizzy.

1554
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:10,560
Maybe you can sleep it off.

1555
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:12,560
No, go downstairs.

1556
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:14,560
Okay, fine.

1557
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,560
Fine, fine.

1558
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:17,560
We'll go back to bed.

1559
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:19,560
A little.

1560
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:28,560
Now, I guess I have to go to sleep.

1561
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,560
No, you definitely are hungry.

1562
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:37,560
Get the fuck out of bed.

1563
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:48,560
You've a glowing light, what?

1564
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,560
Oh, look!

1565
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:09,560
Senpai, do you need a hand?

1566
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,560
Are stairs always as steep?

1567
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,560
Well, maybe if you're scared of them.

1568
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:23,560
No, you can do it.

1569
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:37,560
That's a real hand!

1570
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:45,560
That's a real hand.

1571
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:48,560
Go away, go away, go away.

1572
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,560
Okay.

1573
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,560
What will Senpai do?

1574
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:01,560
Senpai, what are you going to do?

1575
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:06,560
Something.

1576
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:14,560
Can I run?

1577
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,560
Can I only fight?

1578
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:17,560
Okay.

1579
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:25,560
No.

1580
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,560
Senpai.

1581
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:02,560
Take a deep breath.

1582
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:04,560
Don't be afraid.

1583
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:07,560
It's not as scary as you think.

1584
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:09,560
You steady yourself.

1585
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:11,560
Remember how to calm down.

1586
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:13,560
I'm still sick, man.

1587
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:15,560
Oh, we made it down the stairs.

1588
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:17,560
Woo!

1589
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:44,560
Well, it's fine.

1590
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:48,560
Think of me to calm down, Senpai.

1591
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:51,560
You were thinking about me, right?

1592
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:54,560
You got a first aid kit.

1593
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:01,560
The case has been cleared out.

1594
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:05,560
Why not?

1595
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:08,560
Okay, well, let's...

1596
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:13,560
No.

1597
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:23,560
Look in the fridge and found cold steak.

1598
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:25,560
Take it.

1599
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:27,560
You got cold steak.

1600
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:30,560
Probably should heat it up before you eat it.

1601
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:33,560
I'll grab the knife after.

1602
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:36,560
The cold steak in the microwave.

1603
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:45,560
You got microwave steak.

1604
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:49,560
Where's my steak?

1605
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:54,560
You pick up the steak knife.

1606
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:59,560
Yes, a lovingly well done steak.

1607
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:01,560
Would you like to eat something?

1608
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:03,560
Yeah.

1609
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:14,560
What's Chat's favorite...

1610
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,560
I'm not Chat, sorry.

1611
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:19,560
Oh, have it die hard.

1612
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:22,560
Senpai, what's your favorite food?

1613
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:25,560
Actually, I already know, but...

1614
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:30,560
Your stomach didn't agree with that.

1615
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:39,560
Well, time to find the toilet.

1616
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:43,560
That was mom's room.

1617
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:45,560
Bathroom is this one.

1618
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,560
Time to barf.

1619
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:51,560
Bleurgh.

1620
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:13,560
Mercy lemonade?

1621
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:17,560
What?

1622
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:19,560
Mercy lemonade is what?

1623
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:24,560
Let's see.

1624
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:33,560
Icy lemonade!

1625
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:35,560
Where are you guys?

1626
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:38,560
Where's Senpai's getting these lemonades from?

1627
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:43,560
Yeah, yeah, it's a drink.

1628
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:46,560
Not food, but I mean, I guess if it's your favorite,

1629
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:49,560
I can treat you to more.

1630
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:54,560
The air-cooler lemonade stand.

1631
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:10,560
Oh my god.

1632
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:12,560
Oh my gosh.

1633
02:18:12,560 --> 02:18:15,560
What's the price for lemonade nowadays?

1634
02:18:15,560 --> 02:18:19,560
It used to be 25 cents for a cup back in...

1635
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:21,560
back in the old days.

1636
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:31,560
I prefer milk.

1637
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:33,560
Azura.

1638
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,560
Okay, we can sell milk on the side too.

1639
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:37,560
This is a startup.

1640
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:40,560
We're gonna do a violour lemonade stand.

1641
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:48,560
So, milk costs maybe like...

1642
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:51,560
How much does milk cost nowadays?

1643
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:54,560
I usually leave the shop into mama.

1644
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:56,560
Mama and papa.

1645
02:18:58,560 --> 02:19:00,560
Milk spoil is easy though.

1646
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:03,560
Okay, well maybe we can do like...

1647
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:06,560
like, you know, we take that milk

1648
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:09,560
and then we make it into ice cream with the lemonade.

1649
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:12,560
So then we have like a lemonade swirl.

1650
02:19:12,560 --> 02:19:14,560
Yeah?

1651
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:16,560
And then we package it.

1652
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:21,560
Now we package it.

1653
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:32,560
Now we package it and then we sell it at the...

1654
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:34,560
at the lemonade stand.

1655
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:37,560
We'll run it illegally of course.

1656
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:39,560
We won't get a business license.

1657
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:51,560
Self-squeezed.

1658
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:55,560
Oh my gosh.

1659
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:59,560
Azura, Azura should definitely...

1660
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:03,560
should definitely like be the brains of this operation.

1661
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:06,560
Freshly, fresh milk...

1662
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:11,560
Fresh milk with every pop.

1663
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:14,560
I can't even mimic Azura's voice.

1664
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:18,560
Fresh milk with every drop.

1665
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:21,560
Azura's so much better.

1666
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:43,560
I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.

1667
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:46,560
I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.

1668
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:49,560
I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.

1669
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:52,560
Yes, we all want Azura's milks.

1670
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:07,560
Azura could probably crash the milk market.

1671
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:09,560
Yeah.

1672
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:13,560
I swear if Azura like came...

1673
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:17,560
Simpa, you know the mega milk shirt?

1674
02:21:17,560 --> 02:21:21,560
Like, I feel like, you know, Azura would like be...

1675
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:24,560
you know, ultra milk or something.

1676
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:28,560
Mercy milk would be competitor?

1677
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:31,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1678
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:36,560
You haven't tried warm, delicious Azura milk yet.

1679
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,560
Okay?

1680
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:47,560
So everyone, we're going to...

1681
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:50,560
Simpa, we're going to pitch this idea to Strony.

1682
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:54,560
It's going to be a new business venture and we're going to make millions.

1683
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:57,560
Okay? We're going to be millionaires.

1684
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:07,560
Have you tried warm, delicious Azura milk?

1685
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:09,560
Of course.

1686
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:11,560
Everyone in Bielor has.

1687
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:15,560
Hahaha.

1688
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:24,560
Can we get GamerSup's cup with you guys on it?

1689
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:27,560
Well, I don't know.

1690
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:31,560
You'll have to probably pass that idea on to Strony

1691
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:34,560
or I don't know, harass GamerSup.

1692
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:37,560
No, actually do not harass GamerSup's for it.

1693
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:39,560
That was a joke.

1694
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:46,560
That's a joke, but like, you know, that's a joke.

1695
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,560
I promise that part was a joke.

1696
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:54,560
If anyone does it, I relinquish all responsibility for that.

1697
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:56,560
Thank you.

1698
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:04,560
No, no, no, no, no, do it.

1699
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:10,560
But yeah, everyone in Bielor has tried...

1700
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:14,560
Azura milk.

1701
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:19,560
And I think everyone should too, especially if you're a bleeding heart.

1702
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:22,560
I know. Is it bleeding heart?

1703
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:26,560
Oh, I'm so bad. I'm forgetting fan names.

1704
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:37,560
Yeah, it's bleeding hearts.

1705
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:39,560
Okay, whoo.

1706
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:42,560
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

1707
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:46,560
I was like, am I mismer... remembering things?

1708
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:56,560
Well, we'll bring this, we'll make millions, millions.

1709
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:00,560
If I get into Gen 2, can we get Azura milk?

1710
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:02,560
Of course, only if you get into Gen 2.

1711
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:04,560
But first, pay attention to Gen 1.

1712
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:06,560
Us, okay? Us.

1713
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:10,560
We just came out, come on, you already want the next big thing?

1714
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:12,560
I'll fucking kill you.

1715
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:15,560
Oh, sorry, that sounded more like Serani.

1716
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:17,560
Okay?

1717
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:21,560
I'll kill you.

1718
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:26,560
And then...

1719
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:30,560
there won't be a Senpai anymore.

1720
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,560
So pay attention to us.

1721
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:34,560
First.

1722
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:38,560
Enjoy us, what do we... when we can.

1723
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:45,560
But what if I like being stabbed?

1724
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,560
Then you won't get stabbed, easy peasy, right?

1725
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:49,560
Isn't that punishment enough?

1726
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:56,560
So, be good. Be good.

1727
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:57,560
Let's...

1728
02:24:57,560 --> 02:24:59,560
We'll cross the bridge when we get there.

1729
02:24:59,560 --> 02:25:02,560
Right now, you have to pay attention to me.

1730
02:25:03,560 --> 02:25:04,560
Azura.

1731
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:05,560
Chibi.

1732
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:06,560
Icy.

1733
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:09,560
Emi.

1734
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:10,560
Stroni.

1735
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:12,560
Understudi.

1736
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:18,560
I'm sorry.

1737
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:19,560
I'm sorry.

1738
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:20,560
I'm sorry.

1739
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:21,560
I'm sorry.

1740
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:22,560
I'm sorry.

1741
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:23,560
I'm sorry.

1742
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:25,560
Good.

1743
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:27,560
Good Senpai.

1744
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:28,560
Good.

1745
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:31,560
Good boys and good girls.

1746
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:34,560
I'm glad we have our understanding.

1747
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:37,560
How could you talk about anyone else?

1748
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:39,560
Even a figurative anyone else.

1749
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:41,560
You need us right now.

1750
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:44,560
That's all you need right now is us.

1751
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:46,560
So, no more of that.

1752
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:48,560
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

1753
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:51,560
And that's not for at least another year.

1754
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:56,560
So, shh.

1755
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:57,560
Shhh.

1756
02:25:57,560 --> 02:25:58,560
Shhh.

1757
02:25:58,560 --> 02:25:59,560
Shhh.

1758
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:00,560
Shhh.

1759
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:01,560
Shhh.

1760
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:02,560
Shhh.

1761
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:03,560
Shhh.

1762
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:04,560
Shhh.

1763
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:05,560
Shhh.

1764
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:06,560
Shhh.

1765
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:07,560
Shhh.

1766
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:08,560
Shhh.

1767
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:09,560
Shhh.

1768
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:10,560
Shhh.

1769
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,560
Shhh.

1770
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:12,560
Shhh.

1771
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:15,560
Good.

1772
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:17,560
I'm good.

1773
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:19,560
Good Senpai.

1774
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:22,560
You're so kind and trusting.

1775
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:24,560
I knew you would understand.

1776
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:28,560
Alright.

1777
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:29,560
So we just threw up.

1778
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:36,560
You threw up.

1779
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:37,560
Yep.

1780
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:38,560
Yep.

1781
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:39,560
Thought so.

1782
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:43,560
Hahaha.

1783
02:26:45,560 --> 02:26:46,560
Can we flush it?

1784
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:47,560
I threw up.

1785
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,560
I threw up.

1786
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:49,560
Mom, I threw up.

1787
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:52,560
Hahaha.

1788
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:53,560
Stanny.

1789
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:55,560
Imagine standing outside of Adrien's garden.

1790
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:56,560
Mom, me?

1791
02:26:57,560 --> 02:26:58,560
I threw up.

1792
02:26:58,560 --> 02:26:59,560
Wait, what?

1793
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:03,560
No, let me back down!

1794
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:09,560
What the heck?

1795
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:13,560
Hey.

1796
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:15,560
Hey Senpai, it's Mari.

1797
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:16,560
Hahaha.

1798
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:21,560
I'm finally back home, but I forgot my keys.

1799
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:23,560
Could you open the door for me?

1800
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:25,560
Yeah, sure!

1801
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:36,560
Open the door!

1802
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:37,560
Open the door!

1803
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:53,560
Stop having it be closed.

1804
02:27:57,560 --> 02:27:58,560
Hahaha.

1805
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:00,560
Oops.

1806
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:02,560
Spooky.

1807
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:08,560
Did we hear something else?

1808
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:37,560
Something.

1809
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:42,560
Maybe it's the bathroom?

1810
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:54,560
Alright, I guess we gotta look in the mirror.

1811
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:55,560
Right?

1812
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:57,560
Senpai?

1813
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:01,560
Ooh, spooky!

1814
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:07,560
Nope, not there anymore.

1815
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:14,560
Spooky?

1816
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:17,560
Did your heart race a little bit?

1817
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:33,560
It only races for mercy.

1818
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:34,560
Oh, you!

1819
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:37,560
My Senpais are so kind to me.

1820
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:39,560
I knew everyone loved me.

1821
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:42,560
Do we go to sleep now?

1822
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:46,560
Yeah, we'll go to sleep.

1823
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:03,560
Why is Senpai's mom so absent?

1824
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:07,560
Mom went out to the city to check out the new house.

1825
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:11,560
Welcome to white space.

1826
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:16,560
You've been living here as long as you can remember.

1827
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:30,560
Meow, waiting for something to happen?

1828
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:36,560
Tissue box for wiping your sorrows away.

1829
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:40,560
Is something gonna update now?

1830
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:45,560
Okay, so now I know at least this is a steak.

1831
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:47,560
A steak.

1832
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:59,560
Collect keys.

1833
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:02,560
What's this?

1834
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:11,560
In the grass near a stump on a shrouded old bridge

1835
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:16,560
between giant pinwheels near a cast-off cartridge

1836
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:19,560
underneath a wet pillow within a large flame

1837
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:23,560
beneath a trapped door lost in Pyre's flame

1838
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:28,560
lying in a dark cell trapped in a pink cage

1839
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:32,560
in a hall of framed faces far below a big stage.

1840
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:37,560
Spending time with a frog near a game of roulette

1841
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:39,560
amongst the other owls in a water closet

1842
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:42,560
in a small moving room at the end of the plank

1843
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:47,560
within a live shell in a large bubbly tank

1844
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:51,560
surrounded by goo captured in a steel trap

1845
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:54,560
the gut of a whale at the end of a map

1846
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:58,560
in the field of white snow past the end of the road.

1847
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:00,560
Okay.

1848
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,560
Is that my stomach?

1849
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:10,560
Something found nearby.

1850
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,560
What's this?

1851
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:23,560
You found a map.

1852
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:27,560
Okay.

1853
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:34,560
Press right button to open the headspace map.

1854
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:37,560
Like that. Okay.

1855
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:40,560
And then we can just open this up.

1856
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:42,560
Okay, to collect things.

1857
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:49,560
Okay, we have that now.

1858
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:52,560
Okay.

1859
02:32:57,560 --> 02:33:00,560
That was a pretty heavy map, yeah.

1860
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:03,560
Hey, Doorcast, if you'd like to do,

1861
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:06,560
we should open the door.

1862
02:33:15,560 --> 02:33:17,560
Yeah, we should open the door.

1863
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:22,560
Okay.

1864
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:29,560
No.

1865
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:32,560
Mari, thank goodness you're here.

1866
02:33:33,560 --> 02:33:35,560
Have you seen Basil?

1867
02:33:35,560 --> 02:33:37,560
I can't find him anywhere.

1868
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:41,560
We should, we should go tell Mari you're okay.

1869
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:44,560
Oh my goodness.

1870
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:47,560
Oh my goodness.

1871
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:49,560
Ooh.

1872
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:55,560
Will Senpai allow me a bit of time to make another tea?

1873
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:59,560
Of course you will. You have no choice.

1874
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:03,560
Senpais always want me in best health, right?

1875
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:06,560
Okay, I'm going to go make some tea so that I,

1876
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:09,560
I'm out of liquid right now.

1877
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:11,560
Can we get tea too? Of course.

1878
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:14,560
I'll tell you what tea I make this time, okay?

1879
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:15,560
Thank you.

1880
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:21,560
I'll be right back. I'm going to just make a tea.

1881
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:48,560
Okay.

1882
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:18,560
Okay.

1883
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:48,560
Okay.

1884
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:18,560
Okay.

1885
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:48,560
Okay.

1886
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:18,560
Okay.

1887
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:48,560
Okay.

1888
02:38:17,560 --> 02:38:18,560
Okay.

1889
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:48,560
Okay.

1890
02:39:17,560 --> 02:39:18,560
Okay.

1891
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:48,560
Okay.

1892
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:18,560
Okay.

1893
02:40:47,560 --> 02:40:49,560
Okay.

1894
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:18,560
Okay.

1895
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:49,560
Okay.

1896
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:19,560
Okay.

1897
02:42:47,560 --> 02:43:16,560
Senpai, what are you doing?

1898
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:24,560
What are you doing? What have you done?

1899
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:30,560
Spill it.

1900
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:31,560
Spill it.

1901
02:43:31,560 --> 02:43:32,560
Spill it.

1902
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:34,560
Drop what's, whatever's in your mouth.

1903
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:35,560
Open.

1904
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:38,560
Nothing, nothing.

1905
02:43:38,560 --> 02:43:40,560
Took you long enough.

1906
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:41,560
Hi.

1907
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:42,560
Okay.

1908
02:43:42,560 --> 02:43:46,560
I may have accidentally boiled the water a little too full,

1909
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,560
so I had to clean that up a little bit.

1910
02:43:54,560 --> 02:43:55,560
Uh-huh.

1911
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:56,560
Uh-huh.

1912
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:58,560
You were just cleaning, huh?

1913
02:43:58,560 --> 02:44:00,560
What were you cleaning?

1914
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:02,560
What mess did I leave out?

1915
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:04,560
What mess did you leave out?

1916
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:06,560
No ping pong.

1917
02:44:06,560 --> 02:44:08,560
You were playing ping pong?

1918
02:44:11,560 --> 02:44:13,560
Without me?

1919
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:15,560
Senpai.

1920
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:19,560
Senpai, how could you?

1921
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:20,560
Anyways, today's...

1922
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:30,560
Anyways, to, right now, the tea that I decided to go with is echinacea.

1923
02:44:31,560 --> 02:44:33,560
Echinacea tea.

1924
02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:36,560
Same one that I always do.

1925
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:44,560
You brought a pool table to everybody into the cage.

1926
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:45,560
Back again.

1927
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:48,560
Everyone.

1928
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:54,560
Where the universal, universal shock collar that we all got from Shibi.

1929
02:44:56,560 --> 02:45:00,560
And we're putting the shock collar to 10.

1930
02:45:06,560 --> 02:45:07,560
Bzzzzz.

1931
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:36,840
Now, everybody's shocked.

1932
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:38,680
Since when were there shock callers in Wonderland?

1933
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:39,680
Since forever.

1934
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:42,320
I mean, like, that place is full of toys everywhere.

1935
02:45:42,320 --> 02:45:43,320
Come on.

1936
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:46,600
Hey, yeah, I get some of my stuff with them.

1937
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:48,040
You bring tea for the rest of us?

1938
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:50,640
You didn't ask me to bring you back tea, Senpai.

1939
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:52,760
You want me to make you a cup all over again?

1940
02:45:58,120 --> 02:45:59,840
I'm still waiting for this one to cool.

1941
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:03,280
We did ask, though.

1942
02:46:03,280 --> 02:46:04,280
Oh, did you?

1943
02:46:04,280 --> 02:46:05,640
I must have not heard.

1944
02:46:13,400 --> 02:46:14,920
I must have not heard.

1945
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:17,120
I'll make everyone a little cup later.

1946
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,480
Is Echinacea OK?

1947
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:45,320
Anything.

1948
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:46,320
OK.

1949
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:48,320
I'll boil up a teapot.

1950
02:46:48,320 --> 02:46:50,320
I'll bring out the finest teapot.

1951
02:46:52,320 --> 02:46:56,320
I'll bring out the finest teapot and the finest china there is.

1952
02:46:57,320 --> 02:46:59,320
There'll be, like, little cats on them or something.

1953
02:47:02,320 --> 02:47:04,320
Actually, I do have a cat one.

1954
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:06,320
Yeah, I have a really cute cat one.

1955
02:47:14,320 --> 02:47:15,320
We want to hear our cup.

1956
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:17,320
There are six.

1957
02:47:17,320 --> 02:47:18,320
Fight for them.

1958
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:32,320
Fight for them.

1959
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:38,320
Mercy lemonade.

1960
02:47:38,320 --> 02:47:39,320
You've been bad.

1961
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:41,320
Why would I give you that?

1962
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:45,320
I also don't have lemons with me, so you have to wait a few days.

1963
02:47:46,320 --> 02:47:50,320
You have to wait a few days, and I'll come back with the lemonade.

1964
02:47:50,320 --> 02:47:53,320
And then, yeah, it'll be fine.

1965
02:48:03,320 --> 02:48:07,320
Well, let's continue, since you've all been so bad.

1966
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:10,320
Are lemons even in season?

1967
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:11,320
Good question.

1968
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:19,320
Maybe I'll get, like, those lemon zest, and then we'll sprinkle it.

1969
02:48:19,320 --> 02:48:21,320
We'll put some a little bit into water.

1970
02:48:38,320 --> 02:48:45,320
And then maybe, maybe we'll dilute it, and then no one will notice.

1971
02:48:48,320 --> 02:48:50,320
No one will notice at that point.

1972
02:48:50,320 --> 02:48:52,320
You should go tell Mara you're okay.

1973
02:48:52,320 --> 02:48:53,320
She's worried sick.

1974
02:48:53,320 --> 02:48:56,320
Oh, am I stuck out of the window?

1975
02:48:56,320 --> 02:48:57,320
There we go.

1976
02:48:57,320 --> 02:49:00,320
I'm still going to let the tea cool a bit, though.

1977
02:49:00,320 --> 02:49:02,320
But thank you, senpai.

1978
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:07,320
Stretch.

1979
02:49:12,320 --> 02:49:16,320
Okay, we should go tell Mara you're okay.

1980
02:49:16,320 --> 02:49:18,320
Just give me a second.

1981
02:49:18,320 --> 02:49:19,320
Okay.

1982
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:20,320
Okay.

1983
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:21,320
Okay.

1984
02:49:21,320 --> 02:49:24,320
We should go tell Mara you're okay.

1985
02:49:24,320 --> 02:49:26,320
Just give me a second.

1986
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:29,320
We should tell Mara you're okay.

1987
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:30,320
She's been worried sick.

1988
02:49:33,320 --> 02:49:35,320
I don't know, glies.

1989
02:49:35,320 --> 02:49:36,320
Let's get this toaster.

1990
02:49:38,320 --> 02:49:39,320
Toast.

1991
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:47,320
It's going out all night.

1992
02:49:47,320 --> 02:49:49,320
Here's your allowance for today.

1993
02:49:49,320 --> 02:49:50,320
I got 200 clams.

1994
02:49:50,320 --> 02:49:52,320
I got 200 clams!

1995
02:50:02,320 --> 02:50:04,320
They said there was one.

1996
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:05,320
Hold on.

1997
02:50:06,320 --> 02:50:08,320
In the grass near a stump.

1998
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:14,320
Oh, there it is.

1999
02:50:15,320 --> 02:50:16,320
Oh.

2000
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:18,320
Hey.

2001
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:26,320
11 keys left.

2002
02:50:45,320 --> 02:50:47,320
I'll build a sand castle again.

2003
02:50:51,320 --> 02:50:52,320
Okay, let's see.

2004
02:50:52,320 --> 02:50:55,320
Next one on a shrouded old bridge.

2005
02:50:57,320 --> 02:50:59,320
I'm not sure if this is the bridge.

2006
02:51:04,320 --> 02:51:06,320
And there's like a bunch of A's at the end.

2007
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:10,320
Hmm.

2008
02:51:14,320 --> 02:51:15,320
Hmm.

2009
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:26,320
I'm lying.

2010
02:51:26,320 --> 02:51:27,320
You're okay.

2011
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:32,320
Don't worry.

2012
02:51:32,320 --> 02:51:34,320
Don't worry me like that.

2013
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:37,320
Where's Basil?

2014
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:46,320
He's not with you, Maury?

2015
02:51:47,320 --> 02:51:48,320
No.

2016
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:50,320
I'm afraid not.

2017
02:51:50,320 --> 02:51:54,320
The last thing I remember was sorting photos with Basil in his house.

2018
02:51:54,320 --> 02:51:55,320
Next thing I know.

2019
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:59,320
I'm waking up in neighbor's room with Aubrey and Cal.

2020
02:52:15,320 --> 02:52:16,320
Ah.

2021
02:52:21,320 --> 02:52:23,320
At least we found you, Maury.

2022
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:25,320
I hope Basil's okay.

2023
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:27,320
He's gonna protect him if we're not there.

2024
02:52:28,320 --> 02:52:30,320
We'll be such a downer, Aubrey.

2025
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:32,320
We'll find Basil for sure.

2026
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:34,320
Absolutely right, Cal.

2027
02:52:34,320 --> 02:52:37,320
It's times like this we got to stay positive.

2028
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:41,320
I only go back to Basil's house.

2029
02:52:41,320 --> 02:52:43,320
Might be something we missed.

2030
02:52:43,320 --> 02:52:45,320
That's the spirit hero.

2031
02:52:45,320 --> 02:52:48,320
He's always up here if you need me.

2032
02:52:52,320 --> 02:52:53,320
Merci.

2033
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:57,320
May I ask what the guidelines are on Villalor fan video games?

2034
02:52:57,320 --> 02:53:00,320
I don't see anything about on the Villalor website.

2035
02:53:00,320 --> 02:53:01,320
Hmm.

2036
02:53:02,320 --> 02:53:05,320
Is it not on the terms of service?

2037
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:08,320
Not terms of service, the fan work guidelines?

2038
02:53:09,320 --> 02:53:10,320
Oops.

2039
02:53:10,320 --> 02:53:11,320
Hold on.

2040
02:53:11,320 --> 02:53:14,320
Let me put this down a little bit.

2041
02:53:18,320 --> 02:53:19,320
I'm a controller.

2042
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:24,320
Right now my lips are a little dry,

2043
02:53:24,320 --> 02:53:26,320
so I'm gonna have to put lip balm on.

2044
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:42,320
But I don't think there's anything against it,

2045
02:53:42,320 --> 02:53:46,320
but you'll probably have to ask Stronny for management for that.

2046
02:53:46,320 --> 02:53:49,320
Or I'll send in an email through the website.

2047
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:51,320
I'm not like a reliable source.

2048
02:53:59,320 --> 02:54:00,320
How's the tea, Mercy?

2049
02:54:00,320 --> 02:54:02,320
I can't taste it because...

2050
02:54:08,320 --> 02:54:10,320
because it's too hot.

2051
02:54:10,320 --> 02:54:11,320
Still.

2052
02:54:30,320 --> 02:54:34,320
I'm sure we're more than happy to get a fan game.

2053
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:45,320
But I'm pretty sure it's under, like, fan work?

2054
02:54:45,320 --> 02:54:48,320
Fan work derivatives or something?

2055
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:50,320
Just double check it.

2056
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:52,320
Just double check it.

2057
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:57,320
All fan arts, of course, need to comply with the...

2058
02:54:57,320 --> 02:54:58,320
with the...

2059
02:54:58,320 --> 02:54:59,320
Oops.

2060
02:54:59,320 --> 02:55:00,320
Ooh.

2061
02:55:00,320 --> 02:55:02,320
I'm knocking things over.

2062
02:55:03,320 --> 02:55:05,320
With the terms of services?

2063
02:55:08,320 --> 02:55:09,320
Yeah.

2064
02:55:25,320 --> 02:55:27,320
Sorry, just put on a lip balm.

2065
02:55:29,320 --> 02:55:31,320
Ah, my lips get so dry.

2066
02:55:31,320 --> 02:55:33,320
It's been so cold lately.

2067
02:55:39,320 --> 02:55:40,320
Yeah, that's good tea.

2068
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:44,320
Okay.

2069
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:47,320
Let's continue.

2070
02:55:52,320 --> 02:55:54,320
I struggle with dry lips myself.

2071
02:55:54,320 --> 02:55:55,320
Uh, never seems to help.

2072
02:55:55,320 --> 02:55:56,320
Okay.

2073
02:55:57,320 --> 02:55:59,320
Um, I have this trouble, too.

2074
02:55:59,320 --> 02:56:02,320
So the only thing that works for me are two...

2075
02:56:02,320 --> 02:56:03,320
are three things.

2076
02:56:05,320 --> 02:56:06,320
Um...

2077
02:56:09,320 --> 02:56:11,320
Vaseline.

2078
02:56:14,320 --> 02:56:17,320
Um, the specific lip gloss.

2079
02:56:22,320 --> 02:56:23,320
And...

2080
02:56:23,320 --> 02:56:26,320
Okay, this is gonna sound really weird.

2081
02:56:27,320 --> 02:56:32,320
But this is a suggestion a lot of celebrities do.

2082
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:35,320
Which is nipple cream.

2083
02:56:36,320 --> 02:56:38,320
Uh, nipple balm.

2084
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:39,320
Sorry, not nipple cream.

2085
02:56:39,320 --> 02:56:40,320
Nipple balm.

2086
02:56:42,320 --> 02:56:44,320
Because, uh, it's for...

2087
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:46,320
for, um...

2088
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:48,320
for mothers.

2089
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:50,320
When a child is feeding...

2090
02:56:52,320 --> 02:56:54,320
feeding, um, the balm...

2091
02:56:54,320 --> 02:56:59,320
the nipple can get really chapped and dry.

2092
02:56:59,320 --> 02:57:01,320
And because the...

2093
02:57:01,320 --> 02:57:03,320
the, um...

2094
02:57:06,320 --> 02:57:10,320
the texture on the nipple is similar to lips.

2095
02:57:10,320 --> 02:57:11,320
I guess.

2096
02:57:11,320 --> 02:57:15,320
Um, a lot of celebrities use a...

2097
02:57:15,320 --> 02:57:17,320
nipple balm...

2098
02:57:17,320 --> 02:57:19,320
for their lips instead.

2099
02:57:23,320 --> 02:57:24,320
Yeah, it hurts.

2100
02:57:24,320 --> 02:57:25,320
It hurts.

2101
02:57:25,320 --> 02:57:27,320
So, like, a lot of mothers will buy these nipple balms,

2102
02:57:27,320 --> 02:57:28,320
and then they'll...

2103
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:30,320
they'll, uh, it helps with the...

2104
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:32,320
the peeling and the dryness and the pain

2105
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:34,320
and the sores from...

2106
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:36,320
from when a baby, uh...

2107
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:38,320
baby, uh, suckles.

2108
02:57:48,320 --> 02:57:49,320
Yeah.

2109
02:57:49,320 --> 02:57:53,320
Actually, you can literally probably go to any store

2110
02:57:53,320 --> 02:57:55,320
and then they'll have it.

2111
02:57:55,320 --> 02:57:56,320
They'll probably have it.

2112
02:57:56,320 --> 02:57:58,320
Uh, I bought some.

2113
02:57:58,320 --> 02:57:59,320
I bought some not too long ago

2114
02:57:59,320 --> 02:58:01,320
because I had, like, really dry lips.

2115
02:58:01,320 --> 02:58:04,320
Um, a lot of people say, uh,

2116
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:06,320
it lasts quite a long time.

2117
02:58:06,320 --> 02:58:08,320
You only need a little bit.

2118
02:58:08,320 --> 02:58:12,320
And I find that it doesn't dr...

2119
02:58:12,320 --> 02:58:18,320
it doesn't go away as fast as the, um...

2120
02:58:18,320 --> 02:58:20,320
as regular lip balm.

2121
02:58:20,320 --> 02:58:22,320
It doesn't work for me, though,

2122
02:58:22,320 --> 02:58:24,320
because I kind of have sensitive skin,

2123
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:27,320
so if it gets anywhere around the lip area,

2124
02:58:27,320 --> 02:58:29,320
that's not on my lips.

2125
02:58:29,320 --> 02:58:31,320
And it tends to, like, uh, that area

2126
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:33,320
tends to be, like, a little sensitive.

2127
02:58:37,320 --> 02:58:40,320
So, um, let me...

2128
02:58:40,320 --> 02:58:41,320
Okay, I know it's weird,

2129
02:58:41,320 --> 02:58:42,320
but let me find...

2130
02:58:42,320 --> 02:58:44,320
find, uh, it.

2131
02:58:44,320 --> 02:58:45,320
I know it's weird.

2132
02:58:45,320 --> 02:58:46,320
It's weird.

2133
02:58:46,320 --> 02:58:48,320
It's weird, but I want to help.

2134
02:58:48,320 --> 02:59:00,320
So, this is the one...

2135
02:59:00,320 --> 02:59:04,320
I have.

2136
02:59:04,320 --> 02:59:06,320
Let me try to find it.

2137
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:10,320
Here.

2138
02:59:10,320 --> 02:59:12,320
Um...

2139
02:59:12,320 --> 02:59:16,320
I'll show you.

2140
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:18,320
I'll show you.

2141
02:59:18,320 --> 02:59:20,320
It does say cream on it,

2142
02:59:20,320 --> 02:59:22,320
but it's more like a balm.

2143
02:59:22,320 --> 02:59:23,320
It's more like a balm.

2144
02:59:23,320 --> 02:59:25,320
It comes out like a Vaseline balm.

2145
02:59:25,320 --> 02:59:33,320
It-a-ba-ba-ba-ba-neep balm cream.

2146
02:59:33,320 --> 02:59:34,320
My skin's kind of sensitive,

2147
02:59:34,320 --> 02:59:36,320
so it doesn't really work

2148
02:59:36,320 --> 02:59:38,320
for the skin around it,

2149
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:40,320
but this is what I...

2150
02:59:40,320 --> 02:59:41,320
I don't know.

2151
02:59:41,320 --> 02:59:43,320
I don't know.

2152
02:59:43,320 --> 02:59:45,320
It doesn't work the skin around it,

2153
02:59:45,320 --> 02:59:48,320
but this is what I-I found to work.

2154
02:59:48,320 --> 02:59:52,320
This-this one.

2155
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:53,320
Does it smell?

2156
02:59:53,320 --> 02:59:55,320
I don't think it has a particular smell to it,

2157
02:59:55,320 --> 02:59:57,320
especially because it's, uh,

2158
02:59:57,320 --> 02:59:59,320
safe for babies to ingest as well,

2159
02:59:59,320 --> 03:00:01,320
so I think it doesn't have

2160
03:00:01,320 --> 03:00:03,320
any particular smell to it.

2161
03:00:04,320 --> 03:00:13,320
So a lot of celebrities

2162
03:00:13,320 --> 03:00:15,320
will use this instead of

2163
03:00:15,320 --> 03:00:16,320
a regular lip balm

2164
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:21,320
because it's stronger.

2165
03:00:21,320 --> 03:00:24,320
I think it comes in a-a different format now.

2166
03:00:24,320 --> 03:00:26,320
I think it comes in a little jar.

2167
03:00:26,320 --> 03:00:28,320
Jar, but when I bought it,

2168
03:00:28,320 --> 03:00:32,320
it-it's-it's this-it's this little tube.

2169
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:35,320
But yeah, this is, like,

2170
03:00:35,320 --> 03:00:37,320
if you have trouble finding lip balm,

2171
03:00:37,320 --> 03:00:39,320
so, like, if regular lip balm doesn't work for you

2172
03:00:39,320 --> 03:00:41,320
and, like, Vaseline doesn't work for you

2173
03:00:41,320 --> 03:00:43,320
or anything, try this one.

2174
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:51,320
Try this.

2175
03:00:51,320 --> 03:00:54,320
Like, legitimately, it-it-it will help with, uh,

2176
03:00:54,320 --> 03:00:55,320
try it out.

2177
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:57,320
It's not too expensive either, I think.

2178
03:00:57,320 --> 03:01:00,320
Uh, and it lasts forever.

2179
03:01:00,320 --> 03:01:02,320
It lasts forever.

2180
03:01:10,320 --> 03:01:12,320
How much per box?

2181
03:01:12,320 --> 03:01:14,320
I bought it for around ten-

2182
03:01:14,320 --> 03:01:16,320
I bought it for ten dollars,

2183
03:01:16,320 --> 03:01:20,320
and it's a huge little tube, you know?

2184
03:01:20,320 --> 03:01:24,320
It's about-it was about the size of my hand,

2185
03:01:24,320 --> 03:01:26,320
but then again, my hands are-are a bit-

2186
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:30,320
or maybe different size.

2187
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:36,320
I'm not sure.

2188
03:01:36,320 --> 03:01:38,320
I think it might be cheaper at certain places,

2189
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:41,320
but it's definitely something that-that people can use

2190
03:01:41,320 --> 03:01:43,320
for their lips.

2191
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:48,320
For their lips instead of, um,

2192
03:01:48,320 --> 03:01:50,320
instead of regular lip balm.

2193
03:01:50,320 --> 03:01:52,320
Especially if it, uh...

2194
03:01:53,320 --> 03:01:56,320
If it, if it, if it...

2195
03:01:58,320 --> 03:02:00,320
Because, uh, let's be real,

2196
03:02:00,320 --> 03:02:03,320
lip balm industry kind of sucks.

2197
03:02:03,320 --> 03:02:05,320
They literally dry out your lips even more

2198
03:02:05,320 --> 03:02:07,320
and so that you have to reapply it all the time.

2199
03:02:07,320 --> 03:02:09,320
Kind of sucks that way.

2200
03:02:16,320 --> 03:02:20,320
So, yeah, celebrities will use, uh, this little-

2201
03:02:20,320 --> 03:02:23,320
for this-for lip balm instead.

2202
03:02:23,320 --> 03:02:26,320
And since it's, uh, safe for babies to ingest,

2203
03:02:26,320 --> 03:02:28,320
it should be safe on your lips

2204
03:02:28,320 --> 03:02:30,320
and for you to ingest as well.

2205
03:02:35,320 --> 03:02:37,320
So, um...

2206
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:40,320
Yeah, the brand I use normally

2207
03:02:40,320 --> 03:02:43,320
that doesn't make my skin super sensitive,

2208
03:02:43,320 --> 03:02:45,320
is if you have super sensitive skin,

2209
03:02:45,320 --> 03:02:49,320
uh, the nipple-nipple cream might not work for you,

2210
03:02:49,320 --> 03:02:51,320
so I just use Vaseline.

2211
03:02:51,320 --> 03:02:53,320
I just use Vaseline.

2212
03:02:53,320 --> 03:02:55,320
It works.

2213
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:07,320
Does-but does nipple balm come in a nice little container

2214
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:09,320
that fits also nicely in my pocket?

2215
03:03:09,320 --> 03:03:14,320
Um, my advice for that is take a lip balm tin,

2216
03:03:14,320 --> 03:03:17,320
like an empty lip balm tin,

2217
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:19,320
and just squeeze some in.

2218
03:03:30,320 --> 03:03:32,320
Vaseline's the only thing that works for me.

2219
03:03:32,320 --> 03:03:35,320
It's really s-it's-it's petroleum, so...

2220
03:03:38,320 --> 03:03:42,320
Um, but, uh, I find the nipple-the nipple balm,

2221
03:03:42,320 --> 03:03:44,320
like, it's-it's about the size of my hand.

2222
03:03:44,320 --> 03:03:46,320
It actually fits in, like, purse and stuff really well.

2223
03:03:46,320 --> 03:03:49,320
And if-well, if you're-you're a guy,

2224
03:03:49,320 --> 03:03:51,320
you have pockets everywhere, it's gonna fit.

2225
03:03:51,320 --> 03:03:53,320
Your pockets can fit in ten-Nintendo switches,

2226
03:03:53,320 --> 03:03:55,320
so it's fine.

2227
03:04:04,320 --> 03:04:07,320
But, like, if you have sensitive skin,

2228
03:04:07,320 --> 03:04:09,320
um, try it out first.

2229
03:04:09,320 --> 03:04:11,320
Like, try-it might work out for you.

2230
03:04:11,320 --> 03:04:13,320
It didn't work for me,

2231
03:04:14,320 --> 03:04:17,320
but I do use it in emergencies.

2232
03:04:17,320 --> 03:04:21,320
Like, if my skin-my lip-the skin on my lip

2233
03:04:21,320 --> 03:04:23,320
is so chapped it's, like, cutting,

2234
03:04:23,320 --> 03:04:25,320
I will use the nipple balm.

2235
03:04:44,320 --> 03:04:48,320
Cause, um, yeah, I suffer from-from dry skin,

2236
03:04:48,320 --> 03:04:51,320
sensitive skin, mostly dry skin.

2237
03:04:51,320 --> 03:04:55,320
My skin is super dry, so I need to moisturize a lot.

2238
03:04:59,320 --> 03:05:02,320
Wait, Mercy, you can have a lip balm ASMR trigger.

2239
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:04,320
What does that mean?

2240
03:05:04,320 --> 03:05:06,320
How do you do that?

2241
03:05:07,320 --> 03:05:08,320
Thanks, Mercy.

2242
03:05:08,320 --> 03:05:10,320
This has been extremely educational.

2243
03:05:10,320 --> 03:05:13,320
Finally, some-maybe, finally,

2244
03:05:13,320 --> 03:05:16,320
can get some soft lip-sci-cave.

2245
03:05:16,320 --> 03:05:17,320
Yeah.

2246
03:05:17,320 --> 03:05:19,320
Just dry skin or eczema.

2247
03:05:19,320 --> 03:05:21,320
I don't have eczema, but I do have dry skin.

2248
03:05:21,320 --> 03:05:24,320
Pretty dry skin, so my skin will get pretty flaky and stuff.

2249
03:05:29,320 --> 03:05:31,320
That being-that was, like, what?

2250
03:05:31,320 --> 03:05:33,320
Like, popping the lips like this?

2251
03:05:33,320 --> 03:05:34,320
Like, like that?

2252
03:05:34,320 --> 03:05:36,320
Is-is that a trigger?

2253
03:05:40,320 --> 03:05:41,320
Really?

2254
03:05:41,320 --> 03:05:42,320
What?

2255
03:05:42,320 --> 03:05:43,320
It is?

2256
03:05:43,320 --> 03:05:44,320
Oh, okay.

2257
03:05:48,320 --> 03:05:50,320
Thanks for teaching me some pie.

2258
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:58,320
But yeah, I suffer from dry lips,

2259
03:05:58,320 --> 03:06:00,320
so every once in a while during streams,

2260
03:06:00,320 --> 03:06:02,320
I'll be like, uggh, if you see me go like,

2261
03:06:02,320 --> 03:06:03,320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

2262
03:06:03,320 --> 03:06:04,320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

2263
03:06:04,320 --> 03:06:05,320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

2264
03:06:05,320 --> 03:06:06,320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

2265
03:06:06,320 --> 03:06:07,320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

2266
03:06:07,320 --> 03:06:08,320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

2267
03:06:08,320 --> 03:06:09,320
uggh, I'm gonna go like,

2268
03:06:09,320 --> 03:06:11,320
uggh, if you see me go like, uggh,

2269
03:06:11,320 --> 03:06:13,320
I'm putting on the bomb.

2270
03:06:14,320 --> 03:06:17,320
Yeah, mercy my twin with the skin issues.

2271
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:25,320
But yeah, if-if-if everyone,

2272
03:06:25,320 --> 03:06:27,320
if, like, Senpai suffer from dry lips,

2273
03:06:27,320 --> 03:06:29,320
I have, like, tips-

2274
03:06:29,320 --> 03:06:31,320
I have tips, so I have, like,

2275
03:06:31,320 --> 03:06:33,320
I definitely use that one.

2276
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:36,320
Vaseline is my only go-to recently.

2277
03:06:36,320 --> 03:06:38,320
Um...

2278
03:06:38,320 --> 03:06:39,320
And then, for Vaseline,

2279
03:06:39,320 --> 03:06:41,320
I just put it in, like, a little tin.

2280
03:06:51,320 --> 03:06:52,320
You can also probably do the same thing.

2281
03:06:52,320 --> 03:06:54,320
Wanted. What's the Wanted poster?

2282
03:06:56,320 --> 03:06:59,320
Pluto, the ninth planet in the solar system.

2283
03:06:59,320 --> 03:07:01,320
No reward, sorry.

2284
03:07:02,320 --> 03:07:05,320
Huh?

2285
03:07:05,320 --> 03:07:06,320
Faceless Missy.

2286
03:07:06,320 --> 03:07:07,320
Huh? Faceless Missy again?

2287
03:07:07,320 --> 03:07:09,320
It wasn't me this time, I promise.

2288
03:07:09,320 --> 03:07:11,320
I'll leave me alone to repent.

2289
03:07:15,320 --> 03:07:17,320
I'm gonna swing in the moon!

2290
03:07:19,320 --> 03:07:21,320
Eh? There's a mirror here.

2291
03:07:24,320 --> 03:07:26,320
A floating mirror.

2292
03:07:26,320 --> 03:07:28,320
Your friends smile warmly behind you.

2293
03:07:29,320 --> 03:07:31,320
That-that's cute.

2294
03:07:33,320 --> 03:07:34,320
I think it flowers someone,

2295
03:07:34,320 --> 03:07:35,320
but he's only interested in puzzles.

2296
03:07:35,320 --> 03:07:36,320
If only I had a-

2297
03:07:36,320 --> 03:07:38,320
I could find a flower puzzle or something.

2298
03:07:38,320 --> 03:07:40,320
He would notice me.

2299
03:07:41,320 --> 03:07:44,320
I wonder if there's a flower puzzle or something.

2300
03:07:58,320 --> 03:08:00,320
How about you?

2301
03:08:04,320 --> 03:08:06,320
Huh?

2302
03:08:11,320 --> 03:08:13,320
Oh, I'm glad I could help my supplies.

2303
03:08:13,320 --> 03:08:14,320
I know it's a weird-

2304
03:08:14,320 --> 03:08:16,320
I know it's weird, especially if it's like-

2305
03:08:16,320 --> 03:08:18,320
Hey, so, it's got to be around here somewhere.

2306
03:08:18,320 --> 03:08:20,320
Especially since it's like,

2307
03:08:20,320 --> 03:08:21,320
Oh, Violaur, the, uh, the,

2308
03:08:21,320 --> 03:08:23,320
Hoo-hoo, company.

2309
03:08:23,320 --> 03:08:25,320
Kind of sus company.

2310
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:30,320
Oh no, a flower!

2311
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:32,320
It's flowers! They're already dying!

2312
03:08:32,320 --> 03:08:34,320
Do your best to take care of them until Basel gets back.

2313
03:08:36,320 --> 03:08:38,320
Would you like to water the plants?

2314
03:08:38,320 --> 03:08:40,320
Yeah, of course!

2315
03:08:46,320 --> 03:08:48,320
Oh!

2316
03:08:48,320 --> 03:08:50,320
How do I...

2317
03:08:58,320 --> 03:09:00,320
How do I water them?

2318
03:09:02,320 --> 03:09:04,320
Wait, how do I water them?

2319
03:09:04,320 --> 03:09:06,320
Is water the voted ones?

2320
03:09:06,320 --> 03:09:08,320
Okay.

2321
03:09:08,320 --> 03:09:10,320
Well, these are lilies of the valley, so they probably just look like that, huh?

2322
03:09:14,320 --> 03:09:16,320
Okay, well...

2323
03:09:20,320 --> 03:09:22,320
Cacti probably won't die.

2324
03:09:30,320 --> 03:09:32,320
Cacti probably won't die.

2325
03:09:34,320 --> 03:09:36,320
Tulips are fine.

2326
03:09:44,320 --> 03:09:46,320
Ma, are you here?

2327
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:48,320
Get some delicious fruits?

2328
03:10:04,320 --> 03:10:06,320
Cacti probably won't die.

2329
03:10:12,320 --> 03:10:14,320
Wipe your feet, everyone!

2330
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:16,320
Ugh, fuck are you!

2331
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:26,320
Oh, there doesn't seem anything out of the ordinary.

2332
03:10:28,320 --> 03:10:30,320
You think Basel just left somewhere without telling us?

2333
03:10:30,320 --> 03:10:32,320
I don't know, that doesn't sound like him.

2334
03:10:34,320 --> 03:10:36,320
He's usually so considerate about these things.

2335
03:10:38,320 --> 03:10:40,320
Guys, I'm really worried. There's nothing we can do?

2336
03:10:40,320 --> 03:10:42,320
We can't find him!

2337
03:10:42,320 --> 03:10:44,320
What if he's in danger?

2338
03:10:44,320 --> 03:10:46,320
They come, Aubrey.

2339
03:10:46,320 --> 03:10:48,320
I'm worried too, but that won't solve anything.

2340
03:10:48,320 --> 03:10:50,320
He won't slug around the forest.

2341
03:10:50,320 --> 03:10:52,320
Maybe he wandered off and got lost.

2342
03:10:52,320 --> 03:10:54,320
Yeah, cheer up, Aubrey!

2343
03:10:54,320 --> 03:10:56,320
We'll find Basel.

2344
03:10:58,320 --> 03:11:00,320
You guys are right.

2345
03:11:00,320 --> 03:11:02,320
Okay, we gotta keep our hopes up.

2346
03:11:02,320 --> 03:11:04,320
Let's look for Basel in the Vast for it.

2347
03:11:06,320 --> 03:11:08,320
What is that?

2348
03:11:10,320 --> 03:11:12,320
Fireplace is burning.

2349
03:11:12,320 --> 03:11:14,320
It just says Basel left it.

2350
03:11:14,320 --> 03:11:16,320
Look, case.

2351
03:11:16,320 --> 03:11:18,320
It's a little dusty.

2352
03:11:18,320 --> 03:11:20,320
Ah, ah, ah!

2353
03:11:20,320 --> 03:11:22,320
Achoo!

2354
03:11:28,320 --> 03:11:30,320
I guess we gotta kill these dust bunnies.

2355
03:11:32,320 --> 03:11:34,320
Let's go!

2356
03:11:38,320 --> 03:11:40,320
Never mind, we're fine!

2357
03:11:50,320 --> 03:11:52,320
Comfortable looking bed.

2358
03:11:54,320 --> 03:11:56,320
Small plants, they look a little sad.

2359
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:58,320
Okay, well, I guess we gotta go find.

2360
03:12:00,320 --> 03:12:02,320
Go find Basel.

2361
03:12:08,320 --> 03:12:10,320
I know we killed the dust bunny,

2362
03:12:10,320 --> 03:12:12,320
but I'm like, ah, ah, ah!

2363
03:12:12,320 --> 03:12:14,320
Well...

2364
03:12:14,320 --> 03:12:16,320
Yes!

2365
03:12:18,320 --> 03:12:20,320
Stomped out of existence.

2366
03:12:20,320 --> 03:12:22,320
Personally, I don't like dust bunnies either.

2367
03:12:22,320 --> 03:12:24,320
I guess we'll find Basel.

2368
03:12:24,320 --> 03:12:26,320
Personally, I don't like dust bunnies either.

2369
03:12:26,320 --> 03:12:28,320
They make me sneeze.

2370
03:12:28,320 --> 03:12:30,320
I don't like sneezing.

2371
03:12:44,320 --> 03:12:46,320
We're going this way.

2372
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:52,320
Fast forest.

2373
03:12:54,320 --> 03:12:56,320
We're going this way.

2374
03:13:12,320 --> 03:13:14,320
There's a parrot, I think.

2375
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:20,320
Basel!

2376
03:13:20,320 --> 03:13:22,320
Basel, where are you?

2377
03:13:24,320 --> 03:13:26,320
I know.

2378
03:13:26,320 --> 03:13:28,320
I bet my pet rock will know what to do.

2379
03:13:28,320 --> 03:13:30,320
Heck, there'll be a good boy.

2380
03:13:30,320 --> 03:13:32,320
Go find Basel.

2381
03:13:42,320 --> 03:13:44,320
Try your best, buddy.

2382
03:13:46,320 --> 03:13:48,320
This is no time to fool around, Cal.

2383
03:13:48,320 --> 03:13:50,320
Hey, why you?

2384
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:52,320
Pector was just trying to help.

2385
03:13:52,320 --> 03:13:54,320
I call you two.

2386
03:13:54,320 --> 03:13:56,320
We need to keep ourselves focused.

2387
03:14:02,320 --> 03:14:04,320
Squawk!

2388
03:14:04,320 --> 03:14:06,320
Main station.

2389
03:14:06,320 --> 03:14:08,320
Squawk! Squawk!

2390
03:14:08,320 --> 03:14:10,320
Body bridge.

2391
03:14:18,320 --> 03:14:20,320
Your voice is really nice to listen to.

2392
03:14:20,320 --> 03:14:24,320
You say that as I literally squawk.

2393
03:14:42,320 --> 03:14:44,320
Kill the bunny.

2394
03:14:44,320 --> 03:14:46,320
Oh no, it winked.

2395
03:14:48,320 --> 03:14:50,320
Oh no, it winked.

2396
03:15:18,320 --> 03:15:20,320
We won!

2397
03:15:38,320 --> 03:15:40,320
Yay, we won!

2398
03:15:40,320 --> 03:15:42,320
We won!

2399
03:15:46,320 --> 03:15:48,320
We got stuff.

2400
03:15:50,320 --> 03:15:52,320
There's those.

2401
03:15:52,320 --> 03:15:54,320
Got both of them.

2402
03:15:56,320 --> 03:15:58,320
Ah, give me a second.

2403
03:16:02,320 --> 03:16:04,320
Got bracelet.

2404
03:16:04,320 --> 03:16:06,320
Okay.

2405
03:16:06,320 --> 03:16:08,320
And now I can fight this bunny in.

2406
03:16:08,320 --> 03:16:10,320
Go!

2407
03:16:10,320 --> 03:16:12,320
Fight bunny!

2408
03:16:12,320 --> 03:16:14,320
Die!

2409
03:16:16,320 --> 03:16:18,320
No, not the bunny link.

2410
03:16:18,320 --> 03:16:20,320
I can do that too.

2411
03:16:20,320 --> 03:16:22,320
Hold on.

2412
03:16:22,320 --> 03:16:24,320
Pempie, are you ready?

2413
03:16:38,320 --> 03:16:40,320
Okay.

2414
03:16:58,320 --> 03:17:00,320
Got life cam.

2415
03:17:02,320 --> 03:17:06,320
Let's quickly grab stuff.

2416
03:17:06,320 --> 03:17:08,320
Let's get a bottle of juice.

2417
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:18,320
Oh.

2418
03:17:26,320 --> 03:17:28,320
That over here, right?

2419
03:17:36,320 --> 03:17:38,320
Hmm. I don't know, guys.

2420
03:17:38,320 --> 03:17:40,320
I think Basel's in this forest.

2421
03:17:40,320 --> 03:17:42,320
We haven't searched the whole forest yet.

2422
03:17:42,320 --> 03:17:44,320
Can't stop now.

2423
03:17:44,320 --> 03:17:46,320
Cheer up, Aubrey.

2424
03:17:46,320 --> 03:17:48,320
We'll keep searching until we find them.

2425
03:17:48,320 --> 03:17:50,320
We don't find Basel soon.

2426
03:17:50,320 --> 03:17:52,320
Maybe we should meet up with Mari and the playground

2427
03:17:52,320 --> 03:17:54,320
and figure out what to do from there.

2428
03:17:54,320 --> 03:17:56,320
Bridge, right?

2429
03:18:00,320 --> 03:18:02,320
There it is.

2430
03:18:02,320 --> 03:18:04,320
Bee.

2431
03:18:06,320 --> 03:18:08,320
10 keys left.

2432
03:18:12,320 --> 03:18:14,320
Between giant pinwheels.

2433
03:18:22,320 --> 03:18:24,320
Hold on.

2434
03:18:36,320 --> 03:18:38,320
I don't know what to do.

2435
03:18:38,320 --> 03:18:40,320
Oh, we're here.

2436
03:18:40,320 --> 03:18:42,320
It's a good idea.

2437
03:18:42,320 --> 03:18:44,320
We'll be back.

2438
03:18:44,320 --> 03:18:46,320
It's a good idea.

2439
03:18:46,320 --> 03:18:48,320
Let's go.

2440
03:18:48,320 --> 03:18:50,320
We're here!

2441
03:18:50,320 --> 03:18:52,320
Come on.

2442
03:18:52,320 --> 03:18:54,320
Let's go.

2443
03:18:54,320 --> 03:18:56,320
Let's go.

2444
03:18:56,320 --> 03:18:58,320
Come on.

2445
03:18:58,320 --> 03:19:00,320
Come on.

2446
03:19:00,320 --> 03:19:02,320
Come on.

2447
03:19:02,320 --> 03:19:04,320
Come on.

2448
03:19:04,320 --> 03:19:06,320
Come on.

2449
03:19:06,320 --> 03:19:08,320
Come on.

2450
03:19:08,320 --> 03:19:10,320
Come on.

2451
03:19:10,320 --> 03:19:12,320
Come on.

2452
03:19:14,320 --> 03:19:16,320
Come on.

2453
03:19:16,320 --> 03:19:18,320
Come on.

2454
03:19:30,320 --> 03:19:32,320
Come on.

2455
03:19:32,320 --> 03:19:34,320
Come on.

2456
03:19:34,320 --> 03:20:02,920
I might go back because I'm just like oh

2457
03:20:02,920 --> 03:20:10,040
I just have Michael back because I didn't

2458
03:20:10,040 --> 03:20:15,280
explore that entire areola yet and I'm

2459
03:20:15,280 --> 03:20:17,960
kind of a type of player who wants to

2460
03:20:17,960 --> 03:20:19,560
complete everything

2461
03:20:20,180 --> 03:20:23,520
gosh

2462
03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:45,440
I gotta revive us again

2463
03:20:49,560 --> 03:20:53,560
Why is this bunny so fricking strong?!

2464
03:21:12,560 --> 03:21:14,560
No! Not another toast!

2465
03:21:19,560 --> 03:21:21,560
Okay, good, we stabbed it.

2466
03:21:28,560 --> 03:21:30,560
Well, that's a problem.

2467
03:21:49,560 --> 03:21:51,560
Whee! Whee! Whee!

2468
03:21:55,560 --> 03:21:57,560
I gotta run, bye.

2469
03:22:06,560 --> 03:22:08,560
Whoa!

2470
03:22:09,560 --> 03:22:11,560
No, don't touch me!

2471
03:22:12,560 --> 03:22:14,560
Don't, don't, don't!

2472
03:22:15,560 --> 03:22:18,560
Don't touch me, not yet!

2473
03:22:19,560 --> 03:22:21,560
Don't touch me, not yet!

2474
03:22:27,560 --> 03:22:29,560
What the?

2475
03:22:33,560 --> 03:22:36,560
Hello everyone, how's it going? Have you found Basel yet?

2476
03:22:37,560 --> 03:22:39,560
Hey Mari, not look so far I'm afraid.

2477
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:44,560
Oh, I'm sorry guys. Sarah was the way I could help more.

2478
03:22:45,560 --> 03:22:49,560
We're all doing our best, maybe we should start looking outside this forest.

2479
03:22:51,560 --> 03:22:54,560
I know, why don't we try climbing a really long ladder?

2480
03:22:55,560 --> 03:22:57,560
East, one east of the stump.

2481
03:22:58,560 --> 03:23:00,560
Dude, that'll Mari's afraid of heights.

2482
03:23:01,560 --> 03:23:04,560
What if Basel somewhere up there? We gotta take her chances.

2483
03:23:05,560 --> 03:23:07,560
I know, but...

2484
03:23:09,560 --> 03:23:11,560
Oh boy, growing stronger and stronger every day.

2485
03:23:11,560 --> 03:23:14,560
You kind of keep climbing a ladder, can't you?

2486
03:23:15,560 --> 03:23:17,560
Come on little brother, face your fears.

2487
03:23:18,560 --> 03:23:21,560
It's natural to be nervous at first, but you should know that, we all believe in you.

2488
03:23:22,560 --> 03:23:25,560
Come on now Mari, just one measly little ladder.

2489
03:23:26,560 --> 03:23:28,560
No worries that can happen.

2490
03:23:29,560 --> 03:23:30,560
I'm not about this.

2491
03:23:31,560 --> 03:23:32,560
Are you here to be okay? Oh Mari?

2492
03:23:33,560 --> 03:23:34,560
No.

2493
03:23:35,560 --> 03:23:36,560
Okay, just take your time.

2494
03:23:37,560 --> 03:23:39,560
Come on now Mari, you can't just sit tight with Basel missing.

2495
03:23:39,560 --> 03:23:40,560
Mari, we have to do this.

2496
03:23:41,560 --> 03:23:42,560
I'm here to support you.

2497
03:23:43,560 --> 03:23:45,560
If anything happens, we'll be all here to protect you too.

2498
03:23:46,560 --> 03:23:47,560
Won't we all agree?

2499
03:23:48,560 --> 03:23:50,560
No, I guess you're right about that.

2500
03:23:51,560 --> 03:23:53,560
Have nothing to be afraid of as long as we're together.

2501
03:23:54,560 --> 03:23:56,560
Basel's probably all alone. He needs us right now.

2502
03:23:58,560 --> 03:24:00,560
Mari, you need to face your fears for Basel's sake.

2503
03:24:01,560 --> 03:24:02,560
I believe in you.

2504
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:05,560
Take it slow if you like, as long as we get there eventually.

2505
03:24:06,560 --> 03:24:07,560
Woohoo!

2506
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:09,560
Let's go, let's go to the ladder east of the stump.

2507
03:24:11,560 --> 03:24:12,560
I'll see you later Mari.

2508
03:24:13,560 --> 03:24:14,560
I know.

2509
03:24:15,560 --> 03:24:16,560
Stay safe.

2510
03:24:16,560 --> 03:24:18,560
Remember oh Mari, you're stronger than you think.

2511
03:24:20,560 --> 03:24:21,560
Give me a second.

2512
03:24:22,560 --> 03:24:23,560
Yeah, nutritious candy.

2513
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:31,560
I'll probably save as well.

2514
03:24:32,560 --> 03:24:33,560
I yapped so much.

2515
03:24:35,560 --> 03:24:36,560
I yapped so much.

2516
03:24:37,560 --> 03:24:38,560
Hahaha.

2517
03:24:44,560 --> 03:24:46,560
Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

2518
03:24:47,560 --> 03:24:49,560
Hey man, something wrong with Burley?

2519
03:24:50,560 --> 03:24:51,560
Seems a little upset.

2520
03:24:54,560 --> 03:24:55,560
Oh, about that well you see.

2521
03:24:59,560 --> 03:25:00,560
Let me explain.

2522
03:25:01,560 --> 03:25:02,560
Look at this pole.

2523
03:25:03,560 --> 03:25:04,560
Can't you believe it?

2524
03:25:05,560 --> 03:25:06,560
There's no tether ball?

2525
03:25:08,560 --> 03:25:09,560
What are we looking at?

2526
03:25:10,560 --> 03:25:11,560
Yeah, I don't see it.

2527
03:25:14,560 --> 03:25:15,560
Exactly!

2528
03:25:16,560 --> 03:25:17,560
The tether ball is missing.

2529
03:25:18,560 --> 03:25:20,560
And you used his arm and swung it too hard.

2530
03:25:21,560 --> 03:25:22,560
Now the ball has gone off somewhere.

2531
03:25:24,560 --> 03:25:25,560
Never to be seen again.

2532
03:25:26,560 --> 03:25:28,560
I thought you didn't have to use your arms man.

2533
03:25:29,560 --> 03:25:30,560
I'm gonna use your head.

2534
03:25:31,560 --> 03:25:32,560
Like this.

2535
03:25:33,560 --> 03:25:34,560
Sorry Burley.

2536
03:25:35,560 --> 03:25:36,560
Using my head.

2537
03:25:37,560 --> 03:25:38,560
All the time gives me a headache.

2538
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:41,560
That's because you don't have a hard head like I do.

2539
03:25:43,560 --> 03:25:44,560
Oh, something just hit me.

2540
03:25:45,560 --> 03:25:47,560
I'm sure I saw the ball flying off somewhere in that direction.

2541
03:25:50,560 --> 03:25:53,560
Into the vast, into the vast forest?

2542
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:55,560
Never find it now.

2543
03:25:56,560 --> 03:25:57,560
Things will be lost forever.

2544
03:25:58,560 --> 03:25:59,560
I don't smell it Burley.

2545
03:26:00,560 --> 03:26:01,560
We'll find it's ball for you.

2546
03:26:02,560 --> 03:26:03,560
Yeah, be sure you want to do that.

2547
03:26:04,560 --> 03:26:05,560
Fast forward to pretty good use place you know.

2548
03:26:06,560 --> 03:26:12,560
One time, game gun just super gizzy brawl with this ugly pint creature with dead empty eyes and a gaping mouth.

2549
03:26:13,560 --> 03:26:14,560
I outroided it.

2550
03:26:15,560 --> 03:26:16,560
Of course, being cool and smart and all.

2551
03:26:17,560 --> 03:26:19,560
There's no monster in all the universe that can't outrun me.

2552
03:26:22,560 --> 03:26:23,560
What?

2553
03:26:27,560 --> 03:26:28,560
Hey Elmore, why don't you try?

2554
03:26:29,560 --> 03:26:31,560
You and your friends go with Burley and keep her out of trouble.

2555
03:26:32,560 --> 03:26:33,560
I'll go myself, but...

2556
03:26:35,560 --> 03:26:36,560
Man!

2557
03:26:37,560 --> 03:26:39,560
Be all right, I'll be my beings again.

2558
03:26:41,560 --> 03:26:42,560
Oh geez, there's my cue.

2559
03:26:43,560 --> 03:26:44,560
I'm coming happy.

2560
03:26:45,560 --> 03:26:46,560
You safe out there guys.

2561
03:26:47,560 --> 03:26:48,560
See you when you get back.

2562
03:26:50,560 --> 03:26:51,560
Come on Burley.

2563
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:53,560
Come on Burley, let's go find your lost ball.

2564
03:26:54,560 --> 03:26:56,560
You don't have anything to worry about as long as we're together.

2565
03:26:57,560 --> 03:26:58,560
I can't share.

2566
03:26:59,560 --> 03:27:01,560
Just don't get in my way when I show off my totally amazing headbutt skills.

2567
03:27:03,560 --> 03:27:04,560
Let's just get this over with.

2568
03:27:06,560 --> 03:27:07,560
Burley joined your party.

2569
03:27:14,560 --> 03:27:17,560
I guess I'm a little bad because where would my shop please buy something like this?

2570
03:27:19,560 --> 03:27:20,560
I'm gonna get some candy.

2571
03:27:22,560 --> 03:27:23,560
Maybe six candies.

2572
03:27:25,560 --> 03:27:26,560
So I can...

2573
03:27:27,560 --> 03:27:28,560
Heal up.

2574
03:27:31,560 --> 03:27:32,560
What the heck happened over here?

2575
03:27:36,560 --> 03:27:39,560
Rows ran over me and knocked me down, but I'm just lying here because it feels good.

2576
03:27:47,560 --> 03:27:48,560
Oh no, thanks.

2577
03:27:49,560 --> 03:27:50,560
Thanks, you're gonna be okay.

2578
03:27:55,560 --> 03:27:56,560
Is this anywhere in my last moment?

2579
03:27:57,560 --> 03:27:58,560
Is this somewhere else to be or something?

2580
03:27:58,560 --> 03:27:59,560
No.

2581
03:28:00,560 --> 03:28:02,560
Okay, I will go get your lost ball.

2582
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:06,560
Oh, don't forget to use Hero's Healing Skill.

2583
03:28:06,560 --> 03:28:07,560
Oh yeah, I forgot.

2584
03:28:08,560 --> 03:28:09,560
I forgot.

2585
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:15,560
It's not this way, is it?

2586
03:28:17,560 --> 03:28:18,560
Squawk!

2587
03:28:18,560 --> 03:28:19,560
In the Meal Forest.

2588
03:28:19,560 --> 03:28:20,560
Squawk, Squawk!

2589
03:28:20,560 --> 03:28:21,560
Longy Bridge.

2590
03:28:21,560 --> 03:28:22,560
Longy Bridge.

2591
03:28:32,560 --> 03:28:33,560
Where's this?

2592
03:28:45,560 --> 03:28:46,560
Okay.

2593
03:28:46,560 --> 03:28:47,560
Okay.

2594
03:28:50,560 --> 03:28:51,560
I guess not.

2595
03:28:53,560 --> 03:28:54,560
I'll come here soon.

2596
03:28:54,560 --> 03:28:55,560
Oops, I ran into a bunny.

2597
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:17,560
Okay.

2598
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:45,560
Hi, guys.

2599
03:29:46,560 --> 03:29:47,560
It's a bunny.

2600
03:30:00,560 --> 03:30:01,560
Bye bye, bunny.

2601
03:30:16,560 --> 03:30:17,560
There we go.

2602
03:30:18,560 --> 03:30:19,560
Okay, we got it.

2603
03:30:47,560 --> 03:30:48,560
Where's my...

2604
03:30:49,560 --> 03:30:50,560
Kit?

2605
03:30:51,560 --> 03:30:52,560
Snacks? Tofu?

2606
03:30:54,560 --> 03:30:56,560
Here, I'll put Candy on.

2607
03:30:57,560 --> 03:30:58,560
Girl?

2608
03:30:58,560 --> 03:30:59,560
There you go.

2609
03:31:00,560 --> 03:31:01,560
All better.

2610
03:31:07,560 --> 03:31:08,560
What's over here?

2611
03:31:09,560 --> 03:31:10,560
Huh?

2612
03:31:12,560 --> 03:31:13,560
It's the tire swing.

2613
03:31:19,560 --> 03:31:21,560
Alright, we'll kill him again.

2614
03:31:38,560 --> 03:31:41,560
Quickly kill the sprout thing.

2615
03:32:09,560 --> 03:32:10,560
Huh?

2616
03:32:27,560 --> 03:32:28,560
Eh.

2617
03:32:28,560 --> 03:32:29,560
Hmm?

2618
03:32:38,560 --> 03:32:40,560
Some pies need another wink?

2619
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:47,560
I patch on, wink.

2620
03:32:59,560 --> 03:33:00,560
Sorry.

2621
03:33:00,560 --> 03:33:02,560
Bunny, can you wait?

2622
03:33:18,560 --> 03:33:19,560
There we go.

2623
03:33:28,560 --> 03:33:33,560
I can't remember what the weaknesses were.

2624
03:33:52,560 --> 03:33:55,560
Like, angry over sad, okay.

2625
03:33:58,560 --> 03:33:59,560
Be stronger than sad.

2626
03:34:00,560 --> 03:34:01,560
Sad, stronger than him.

2627
03:34:02,560 --> 03:34:03,560
Okay.

2628
03:34:05,560 --> 03:34:08,560
Eh, we'll make this dish sad.

2629
03:34:11,560 --> 03:34:12,560
Hopefully.

2630
03:34:28,560 --> 03:34:29,560
Okay.

2631
03:34:49,560 --> 03:34:51,560
I think Omlauri has stronger...

2632
03:34:52,560 --> 03:34:53,560
...stronger attack.

2633
03:34:58,560 --> 03:34:59,560
Okay.

2634
03:35:16,560 --> 03:35:17,560
There we go.

2635
03:35:23,560 --> 03:35:24,560
There we go.

2636
03:35:24,560 --> 03:35:26,560
We just managed to offball.

2637
03:35:26,560 --> 03:35:27,560
Oh.

2638
03:35:28,560 --> 03:35:29,560
There we go.

2639
03:35:38,560 --> 03:35:39,560
There we go.

2640
03:35:42,560 --> 03:35:44,560
I'm starting to get the hang of it.

2641
03:35:44,560 --> 03:35:45,560
Yepa.

2642
03:35:49,560 --> 03:35:51,560
Oh, I'm probably gonna heal again.

2643
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:56,560
I hate eggs.

2644
03:35:56,560 --> 03:35:57,560
I hate stepping on eggs.

2645
03:35:57,560 --> 03:36:00,560
I think the possibility of even stepping on eggs is disgusting.

2646
03:36:21,560 --> 03:36:23,560
Okay, where's that tether ball?

2647
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:25,560
Yeah, Jax.

2648
03:36:32,560 --> 03:36:33,560
Not over here.

2649
03:36:36,560 --> 03:36:38,560
I say totally avoiding...

2650
03:36:40,560 --> 03:36:41,560
...rain station.

2651
03:36:54,560 --> 03:36:56,560
Hi, I'm the wise rock.

2652
03:36:56,560 --> 03:36:57,560
I'll give you solid advice.

2653
03:36:57,560 --> 03:36:58,560
It can exchange for clams.

2654
03:36:58,560 --> 03:36:59,560
Kind of vice.

2655
03:37:00,560 --> 03:37:03,560
Would you like me to give good advice?

2656
03:37:04,560 --> 03:37:05,560
Okay, advice.

2657
03:37:05,560 --> 03:37:06,560
Bad advice.

2658
03:37:06,560 --> 03:37:07,560
Okay.

2659
03:37:07,560 --> 03:37:09,560
And everyone wants...

2660
03:37:09,560 --> 03:37:10,560
...wants an okay...

2661
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:11,560
...good advice, right?

2662
03:37:14,560 --> 03:37:16,560
How bad is your egg allergy?

2663
03:37:16,560 --> 03:37:18,560
Like, have a pen handy?

2664
03:37:19,560 --> 03:37:21,560
You guys wanna give a bad advice?

2665
03:37:21,560 --> 03:37:22,560
Okay.

2666
03:37:25,560 --> 03:37:26,560
Let's see.

2667
03:37:26,560 --> 03:37:27,560
I have...

2668
03:37:27,560 --> 03:37:29,560
My allergy is pretty bad.

2669
03:37:29,560 --> 03:37:30,560
Like, if I touch it...

2670
03:37:31,560 --> 03:37:33,560
...my throat constricts and stuff,

2671
03:37:33,560 --> 03:37:35,560
I don't need an FD pen.

2672
03:37:36,560 --> 03:37:39,560
I usually, if I have the first sign...

2673
03:37:40,560 --> 03:37:41,560
...of the allergy coming,

2674
03:37:41,560 --> 03:37:43,560
I will use Benadryl.

2675
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:46,560
But if I eat too much...

2676
03:37:46,560 --> 03:37:48,560
...or ingest eggs too much,

2677
03:37:48,560 --> 03:37:50,560
I will need to be hospitalized.

2678
03:37:51,560 --> 03:37:54,560
So, yeah, that's...

2679
03:37:54,560 --> 03:37:56,560
I'm pretty allergic.

2680
03:37:56,560 --> 03:37:57,560
What is...

2681
03:37:57,560 --> 03:37:58,560
What is my...

2682
03:37:58,560 --> 03:38:00,560
If you look up a certain thing,

2683
03:38:00,560 --> 03:38:02,560
let me see what it's called again.

2684
03:38:03,560 --> 03:38:04,560
Let me see something.

2685
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:05,560
What it's called again.

2686
03:38:05,560 --> 03:38:06,560
Yeah.

2687
03:38:51,560 --> 03:38:52,560
Ah, okay.

2688
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:54,560
My allergy...

2689
03:38:55,560 --> 03:38:56,560
What happens?

2690
03:38:57,560 --> 03:38:58,560
Is called...

2691
03:38:59,560 --> 03:39:00,560
Angio...

2692
03:39:01,560 --> 03:39:03,560
Angioedema.

2693
03:39:05,560 --> 03:39:06,560
But it's...

2694
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:07,560
It's worse for me,

2695
03:39:07,560 --> 03:39:09,560
because my throat actually swells as well.

2696
03:39:10,560 --> 03:39:11,560
So then I can't breathe.

2697
03:39:12,560 --> 03:39:13,560
So...

2698
03:39:13,560 --> 03:39:14,560
I have...

2699
03:39:14,560 --> 03:39:15,560
I have...

2700
03:39:15,560 --> 03:39:16,560
I have...

2701
03:39:16,560 --> 03:39:17,560
I have...

2702
03:39:17,560 --> 03:39:18,560
I have...

2703
03:39:18,560 --> 03:39:19,560
I have...

2704
03:39:19,560 --> 03:39:20,560
I have...

2705
03:39:20,560 --> 03:39:22,560
So I get swollen eyes.

2706
03:39:23,560 --> 03:39:24,560
Swollen lips.

2707
03:39:25,560 --> 03:39:26,560
Swollen tongue.

2708
03:39:26,560 --> 03:39:28,560
And my throat gets swollen as well.

2709
03:39:30,560 --> 03:39:31,560
So then I can't breathe.

2710
03:39:31,560 --> 03:39:33,560
Then I have to go to the hospital.

2711
03:39:36,560 --> 03:39:37,560
So...

2712
03:39:37,560 --> 03:39:38,560
If...

2713
03:39:38,560 --> 03:39:40,560
To have a visual...

2714
03:39:41,560 --> 03:39:42,560
Um...

2715
03:39:43,560 --> 03:39:45,560
Visual of what I will look like.

2716
03:39:45,560 --> 03:39:46,560
Just think of how...

2717
03:39:46,560 --> 03:39:47,560
How Pepe...

2718
03:39:47,560 --> 03:39:49,560
Pepe the frog looks.

2719
03:39:49,560 --> 03:39:51,560
I will look exactly like that.

2720
03:40:06,560 --> 03:40:07,560
But, um...

2721
03:40:07,560 --> 03:40:09,560
Sorry, I keep on falling asleep.

2722
03:40:09,560 --> 03:40:11,560
My motto keeps on falling asleep.

2723
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:18,560
Uh, eggs are everywhere in most foods, basically.

2724
03:40:18,560 --> 03:40:20,560
Does this mean you have a...

2725
03:40:20,560 --> 03:40:21,560
A specified diet?

2726
03:40:21,560 --> 03:40:22,560
Uh...

2727
03:40:22,560 --> 03:40:24,560
I eat mostly vegan.

2728
03:40:24,560 --> 03:40:26,560
Mostly vegan.

2729
03:40:27,560 --> 03:40:28,560
Um...

2730
03:40:29,560 --> 03:40:30,560
Unfortunately.

2731
03:40:31,560 --> 03:40:33,560
It's like vegan, but not by choice.

2732
03:40:35,560 --> 03:40:37,560
Do you like the taste of eggs?

2733
03:40:37,560 --> 03:40:40,560
I've never even tasted eggs in my entire life.

2734
03:40:49,560 --> 03:40:51,560
Can't eat mayo either?

2735
03:40:51,560 --> 03:40:53,560
No, I can't have mayo.

2736
03:40:53,560 --> 03:40:55,560
Oh, but recently, um...

2737
03:40:55,560 --> 03:40:56,560
How...

2738
03:40:56,560 --> 03:40:57,560
How...

2739
03:40:57,560 --> 03:40:58,560
How many...

2740
03:40:58,560 --> 03:41:01,560
How many have made a vegan mayo?

2741
03:41:01,560 --> 03:41:03,560
Which, apparently, according to my...

2742
03:41:03,560 --> 03:41:05,560
My gal pals...

2743
03:41:05,560 --> 03:41:06,560
It tastes...

2744
03:41:06,560 --> 03:41:08,560
It tastes exactly like mayo.

2745
03:41:08,560 --> 03:41:11,560
So I've been using that recently for my sandwiches.

2746
03:41:12,560 --> 03:41:13,560
Hahahaha!

2747
03:41:16,560 --> 03:41:17,560
I, um...

2748
03:41:17,560 --> 03:41:21,560
Only, I feel like, within like the past few years...

2749
03:41:21,560 --> 03:41:24,560
Was like when things started, uh...

2750
03:41:24,560 --> 03:41:27,560
People have started to accept like vegan as like...

2751
03:41:27,560 --> 03:41:28,560
As like a...

2752
03:41:28,560 --> 03:41:30,560
It started to be more of a trendy diet.

2753
03:41:30,560 --> 03:41:31,560
Uh...

2754
03:41:32,560 --> 03:41:34,560
Like, I tried...

2755
03:41:35,560 --> 03:41:37,560
A cake for the first time.

2756
03:41:37,560 --> 03:41:39,560
Like a moist cake.

2757
03:41:39,560 --> 03:41:41,560
For the first time in adulthood.

2758
03:41:44,560 --> 03:41:45,560
Hahahaha!

2759
03:41:49,560 --> 03:41:51,560
Now, which has got any...

2760
03:41:51,560 --> 03:41:53,560
Favorite kind of bread?

2761
03:41:57,560 --> 03:42:01,560
I don't know, I think bread is usually pretty safe.

2762
03:42:01,560 --> 03:42:02,560
Hahahaha!

2763
03:42:10,560 --> 03:42:12,560
But, uh, I tested it.

2764
03:42:12,560 --> 03:42:14,560
Uh, I think it's only bird eggs.

2765
03:42:14,560 --> 03:42:16,560
I've never tried lizard eggs.

2766
03:42:16,560 --> 03:42:18,560
And I'm a little too scared to try, but...

2767
03:42:18,560 --> 03:42:19,560
Um...

2768
03:42:19,560 --> 03:42:21,560
Mama!

2769
03:42:21,560 --> 03:42:23,560
In my youth.

2770
03:42:23,560 --> 03:42:26,560
I've been allergic to eggs since I was born.

2771
03:42:26,560 --> 03:42:28,560
So, um...

2772
03:42:29,560 --> 03:42:30,560
So...

2773
03:42:33,560 --> 03:42:37,560
Mama! Mama tried to give me a quail egg.

2774
03:42:37,560 --> 03:42:39,560
And that didn't go well either.

2775
03:42:39,560 --> 03:42:40,560
And I tried duck egg.

2776
03:42:40,560 --> 03:42:42,560
And I went to the hospital as well.

2777
03:42:42,560 --> 03:42:45,560
So, I'm pretty sure all kinds of bird eggs are bad.

2778
03:42:51,560 --> 03:42:53,560
And I've even tried balut.

2779
03:42:53,560 --> 03:42:55,560
But, uh...

2780
03:42:55,560 --> 03:42:57,560
I also died from that.

2781
03:42:57,560 --> 03:42:58,560
So, something...

2782
03:42:58,560 --> 03:43:00,560
Something about eggs, bad.

2783
03:43:02,560 --> 03:43:05,560
So, I've been to the hospital several times.

2784
03:43:06,560 --> 03:43:07,560
Fish eggs are fine.

2785
03:43:07,560 --> 03:43:09,560
I don't know why, but fish eggs are fine.

2786
03:43:13,560 --> 03:43:15,560
Mama tried to kill you if she tried.

2787
03:43:15,560 --> 03:43:17,560
Um, let's just say I...

2788
03:43:17,560 --> 03:43:21,560
It wasn't until a long time into my childhood

2789
03:43:21,560 --> 03:43:23,560
that I, um...

2790
03:43:24,560 --> 03:43:28,560
That the doctors have finally found out that I was allergic to eggs.

2791
03:43:36,560 --> 03:43:38,560
So, I was kind of like force fed.

2792
03:43:38,560 --> 03:43:40,560
And like eggs for a while.

2793
03:43:40,560 --> 03:43:42,560
A lot, um...

2794
03:43:42,560 --> 03:43:44,560
Oh, this is gonna sound bad.

2795
03:43:44,560 --> 03:43:45,560
I was...

2796
03:43:46,560 --> 03:43:48,560
I was punished a lot.

2797
03:43:49,560 --> 03:43:50,560
In my youth.

2798
03:43:51,560 --> 03:43:53,560
Especially by relatives.

2799
03:43:53,560 --> 03:43:55,560
I was punished a lot in my youth.

2800
03:43:57,560 --> 03:43:59,560
Because they all thought I was just a picky eater.

2801
03:44:06,560 --> 03:44:08,560
Then they punished you by mail.

2802
03:44:08,560 --> 03:44:10,560
They punished force feeding me.

2803
03:44:11,560 --> 03:44:12,560
It's...

2804
03:44:12,560 --> 03:44:14,560
It was pretty much child abuse.

2805
03:44:17,560 --> 03:44:18,560
And, uh...

2806
03:44:18,560 --> 03:44:20,560
Other methods.

2807
03:44:21,560 --> 03:44:24,560
But I would always say to my parents,

2808
03:44:24,560 --> 03:44:25,560
like, it hurts to eat.

2809
03:44:25,560 --> 03:44:26,560
It hurts to eat.

2810
03:44:26,560 --> 03:44:28,560
And they didn't get it.

2811
03:44:28,560 --> 03:44:30,560
They didn't get it.

2812
03:44:35,560 --> 03:44:38,560
They just thought I was a picky eater.

2813
03:44:45,560 --> 03:44:48,560
But it wasn't until, I guess,

2814
03:44:48,560 --> 03:44:51,560
when I was almost nearing pre-teens,

2815
03:44:51,560 --> 03:44:53,560
where the doctors were like,

2816
03:44:53,560 --> 03:44:57,560
we found out why you're hospitalized all the time.

2817
03:44:59,560 --> 03:45:02,560
Hahaha.

2818
03:45:09,560 --> 03:45:10,560
But it's fine now.

2819
03:45:10,560 --> 03:45:11,560
It's fine now.

2820
03:45:11,560 --> 03:45:15,560
Now I know what I'm allergic to and now...

2821
03:45:15,560 --> 03:45:17,560
and what to avoid.

2822
03:45:18,560 --> 03:45:19,560
So, yeah.

2823
03:45:19,560 --> 03:45:21,560
Hahaha.

2824
03:45:21,560 --> 03:45:31,500
I probably thought it was healthy back then, but no, definitely they're like, okay, no,

2825
03:45:31,500 --> 03:45:35,620
no, no, no, no, you're not gonna get this because I definitely, when they force fed

2826
03:45:35,620 --> 03:45:43,620
me to eat things, it was like hospitalized afterwards all the time.

2827
03:45:43,620 --> 03:45:52,620
Oops, it's fine now, don't worry.

2828
03:45:52,620 --> 03:46:00,620
Childhood trauma, nobody can trauma dump on me, I trauma dump on everyone else.

2829
03:46:14,620 --> 03:46:28,620
But yeah, my sister definitely ran away because my parents are definitely overbearing.

2830
03:46:28,620 --> 03:46:38,620
They are definitely overbearing, but they do love us.

2831
03:46:38,620 --> 03:46:46,620
They do love us, trust me, I know.

2832
03:46:46,620 --> 03:46:53,620
And I think they relaxed quite a bit, they relaxed quite a bit.

2833
03:46:53,620 --> 03:47:02,620
When I was in school though, they were very strict, they were very, very strict.

2834
03:47:02,620 --> 03:47:08,620
They were very strict, but then now I feel kind of weird.

2835
03:47:08,620 --> 03:47:18,620
I kind of feel kind of weird because now I have a lot of freedom and I don't get in trouble as much anymore.

2836
03:47:18,620 --> 03:47:24,620
Or even at all, I don't really get in trouble at all.

2837
03:47:24,620 --> 03:47:31,620
So it kind of feels weird suddenly gaining all this freedom.

2838
03:47:31,620 --> 03:47:33,620
I guess.

2839
03:47:33,620 --> 03:47:41,620
My sister ran away sort of like the moment she was able to, when she graduated high school, she was like,

2840
03:47:41,620 --> 03:47:48,620
okay, I'm going to study right now, bye.

2841
03:47:48,620 --> 03:47:50,620
Do you like it, do you miss it?

2842
03:47:50,620 --> 03:47:56,620
The kind of strangulating strictness, not really.

2843
03:47:56,620 --> 03:48:00,620
It just still feels weird, does that make sense?

2844
03:48:00,620 --> 03:48:03,620
It just feels strange.

2845
03:48:03,620 --> 03:48:10,620
Because you know, my entire life was like, I was brought up pretty strictly,

2846
03:48:10,620 --> 03:48:22,620
and then now it's just like, oh okay, you're an adult now, feel free to do whatever you want.

2847
03:48:22,620 --> 03:48:26,620
What made the change happen?

2848
03:48:26,620 --> 03:48:28,620
I don't know.

2849
03:48:29,620 --> 03:48:40,620
I guess when I, when, I guess it's at the time they were like, well, here you go.

2850
03:48:47,620 --> 03:48:51,620
Freedom's nice, you guys don't get that right though.

2851
03:48:51,620 --> 03:48:57,620
At least I don't get that right.

2852
03:48:57,620 --> 03:49:06,620
I guess, I guess like, they were just like, oh, you're done school now?

2853
03:49:06,620 --> 03:49:09,620
Do whatever you want.

2854
03:49:09,620 --> 03:49:13,620
But then I guess, I don't know, I guess in a way they were overbearing,

2855
03:49:13,620 --> 03:49:19,620
but now they're begging me not to leave.

2856
03:49:19,620 --> 03:49:26,620
I guess that makes sense.

2857
03:49:27,620 --> 03:49:30,620
Yeah.

2858
03:49:39,620 --> 03:49:46,620
But like I said earlier in stream, when I had an internship in Japan,

2859
03:49:46,620 --> 03:49:51,620
I had an internship in Japan, I moved to Japan for three months,

2860
03:49:51,620 --> 03:49:56,620
and I was telling Mama and Papa like, oh yeah, if I get a job there,

2861
03:49:56,620 --> 03:50:00,620
I might, I might, you know, I might move, I might move here.

2862
03:50:00,620 --> 03:50:04,620
And they said, you're moving to Japan? Okay, we're gonna come too.

2863
03:50:04,620 --> 03:50:19,620
They were like, they were so adamant.

2864
03:50:19,620 --> 03:50:21,620
And I was like, oh, I don't know, like maybe.

2865
03:50:21,620 --> 03:50:24,620
And they were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we'll get a house with you.

2866
03:50:24,620 --> 03:50:27,620
We'll get a house with you and we'll move in.

2867
03:50:27,620 --> 03:50:30,620
We'll move in together as a family.

2868
03:50:34,620 --> 03:50:54,620
I mean, they've already said to me like, if I ever move to Europe,

2869
03:50:54,620 --> 03:50:56,620
they want to come with me.

2870
03:50:56,620 --> 03:50:58,620
If I ever move to like Australia, they'll come with me.

2871
03:50:58,620 --> 03:51:08,620
If I move to the US, they'll come with me.

2872
03:51:08,620 --> 03:51:10,620
They'll come with me.

2873
03:51:39,620 --> 03:51:41,620
Man, I'm so stupid.

2874
03:51:54,620 --> 03:51:59,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, everyone lives in my basement.

2875
03:51:59,620 --> 03:52:07,620
I think, I think I might have been easy to figure it out.

2876
03:52:07,620 --> 03:52:10,620
Oops.

2877
03:52:10,620 --> 03:52:13,620
Oh, whatever.

2878
03:52:13,620 --> 03:52:16,620
Oh, whatever.

2879
03:52:16,620 --> 03:52:22,620
Wow, got sad with the bag.

2880
03:52:22,620 --> 03:52:31,620
Anyways, yeah.

2881
03:52:31,620 --> 03:52:47,620
Yeah, they wanted to stick around all the times, I guess.

2882
03:52:47,620 --> 03:52:50,620
My bad.

2883
03:52:50,620 --> 03:52:53,620
So yeah, they definitely were like, oh, yeah, we want to move.

2884
03:52:53,620 --> 03:52:59,620
When I told them, I told my parents recently like, oh, hey, I want to move out,

2885
03:52:59,620 --> 03:53:02,620
but I want to move out really close so I can have my privacy.

2886
03:53:02,620 --> 03:53:04,620
They were like, oh, you want to move to a new house?

2887
03:53:04,620 --> 03:53:05,620
Sure.

2888
03:53:05,620 --> 03:53:08,620
Sure, everyone, right?

2889
03:53:08,620 --> 03:53:14,620
And I went, no, I meant alone.

2890
03:53:14,620 --> 03:53:16,620
Maybe alone.

2891
03:53:16,620 --> 03:53:24,620
No, no, you bring us with you.

2892
03:53:24,620 --> 03:53:34,620
Anyways, I was like, no, no, I mean, like, alone without you for my independence.

2893
03:53:34,620 --> 03:53:42,620
And they went, did we do something wrong?

2894
03:53:42,620 --> 03:53:46,620
Did we do something wrong?

2895
03:53:46,620 --> 03:53:50,620
Why don't you like us, like us anymore?

2896
03:53:50,620 --> 03:54:03,620
I was like, oh, no.

2897
03:54:03,620 --> 03:54:18,620
Oh, yeah, I do get it from my mom.

2898
03:54:19,620 --> 03:54:26,620
Is Mama Modiste also a yander?

2899
03:54:26,620 --> 03:54:29,620
A bit.

2900
03:54:29,620 --> 03:54:34,620
A bit, actually.

2901
03:54:34,620 --> 03:54:36,620
Actually, she went out of nowhere.

2902
03:54:36,620 --> 03:54:45,620
Out of nowhere, came up to me and was like, if, if, honey, honey, if you ever get a boyfriend and he hurts you, I'll kill him.

2903
03:54:45,620 --> 03:54:47,620
I'll fucking kill him.

2904
03:54:47,620 --> 03:55:11,620
She literally said, said, I'll fucking kill him.

2905
03:55:11,620 --> 03:55:17,620
Papa was the same thing.

2906
03:55:17,620 --> 03:55:27,620
It kind of does run in the family, yeah.

2907
03:55:27,620 --> 03:55:36,620
So, yeah, Mama, Mama was like, you know, yeah, she can be a little, she can be really scary sometimes.

2908
03:55:36,620 --> 03:55:44,620
Like, she, oh my gosh, sometimes I think she's psychic.

2909
03:55:44,620 --> 03:55:59,620
But she knows a lot, she knows a lot of things, and I'm just like.

2910
03:55:59,620 --> 03:56:05,620
She knows a lot of things, and it kind of scares me because sometimes she reads my mind.

2911
03:56:05,620 --> 03:56:10,620
Oh, yeah, she did predict my viewer career.

2912
03:56:10,620 --> 03:56:13,620
She, okay, do you guys, okay.

2913
03:56:13,620 --> 03:56:22,620
I didn't get to say this in, I didn't get to say this in debut 2.0 because I got really tired.

2914
03:56:22,620 --> 03:56:31,620
Because I got sick before stream and then I got really tired, so I had to only hit around like the two hour ish mark.

2915
03:56:31,620 --> 03:56:36,620
But, um, what was it?

2916
03:56:36,620 --> 03:56:46,620
Um, so Mama comes from a little bit of a family of like fortune tellers.

2917
03:56:46,620 --> 03:57:08,620
So in Vietnam, um, they have a fortune, uh, fortune telling, fortune telling using regular playing cards.

2918
03:57:08,620 --> 03:57:14,620
And so out of nowhere, she just decided to read my, read my fortune.

2919
03:57:14,620 --> 03:57:24,620
Mmm, no, no, no, not tarot cards, like a regular playing deck. So with like the suits and stuff.

2920
03:57:24,620 --> 03:57:29,620
Yeah, like kind of how you would, but it's like, uh, it's Vietnamese style.

2921
03:57:29,620 --> 03:57:41,620
So it's very common if you go to Vietnam, you'll see people do this type of fortune telling.

2922
03:57:41,620 --> 03:57:53,460
So she was like, okay, your career is something to do with the internet.

2923
03:57:53,460 --> 03:57:59,860
You're going to meet a woman who's going to help you achieve your goals.

2924
03:57:59,860 --> 03:58:07,860
Your work is going to not necessarily be normal, but if it's going to be lots of hard work,

2925
03:58:07,860 --> 03:58:21,460
but it's going to be lots of hard work, but it will be fruitful.

2926
03:58:21,460 --> 03:58:25,300
It will be fruitful and quite lucrative.

2927
03:58:26,180 --> 03:58:38,180
And the woman that you will meet wears primarily black or has black hair.

2928
03:58:45,380 --> 03:58:50,580
And that's what that's what she said. And then that was it. That was it. And this was

2929
03:58:51,140 --> 03:58:57,300
a month, months before I found out about violour.

2930
03:58:59,300 --> 03:59:04,020
Do you have fortune telling powers? I can do a bit of fortune telling.

2931
03:59:04,020 --> 03:59:19,540
I can do a little fortune telling, not lotto numbers, but like tarot cards.

2932
03:59:20,260 --> 03:59:22,660
Like tarot cards, I can do it a little bit.

2933
03:59:22,980 --> 03:59:38,020
But I think mama thought that teaching kids online is kind of a little bit different,

2934
03:59:38,020 --> 03:59:42,900
because it's not physically teaching people online and stuff.

2935
03:59:47,140 --> 03:59:50,500
So I guess mama thought it was something like that.

2936
03:59:53,220 --> 03:59:55,540
So it's not really a normal job.

2937
03:59:59,220 --> 04:00:04,740
So I can do it. Sometimes even my friends, they've liked my fortune

2938
04:00:05,460 --> 04:00:13,220
telling so much that they've actually gotten paid to do it. I'm still a beginner, Bill.

2939
04:00:13,220 --> 04:00:18,660
In my opinion, I'm still a beginner, but mama thinks I inherited the gift from the family.

2940
04:00:19,380 --> 04:00:24,020
It sounds a little weird, right? It's like, oh, you know, you're pretty good at this.

2941
04:00:24,020 --> 04:00:31,380
Yeah, maybe as you know, mama's side of the family has a bit of like a history to fortune

2942
04:00:31,380 --> 04:00:45,060
telling and stuff. I think you mentioned the fortune telling before,

2943
04:00:45,060 --> 04:00:50,820
or maybe Shibi said something very similar. Probably. It was probably, maybe Shibi mentioned it.

2944
04:00:50,820 --> 04:00:59,220
We talked about like tarot cards and stuff, because they're kind of into like that as well.

2945
04:00:59,220 --> 04:01:04,420
I do a lot of good luck stuff, because I don't know, it just makes me feel safer.

2946
04:01:10,420 --> 04:01:14,100
It's just for fun, though. It's just for fun. Fortune telling and stuff is just for fun.

2947
04:01:14,100 --> 04:01:18,260
So don't take it seriously, guys. Don't take it seriously, Senpai.

2948
04:01:20,660 --> 04:01:26,580
But yeah, mama, mama, mama definitely pulled me out of nowhere and did that. And you know what?

2949
04:01:26,580 --> 04:01:34,340
Because she's my mama. I'm generally like, okay, I'm listening. I don't know why she does it,

2950
04:01:34,340 --> 04:01:40,900
how she does it, but like, you know, every time she says something bad will happen today, don't go

2951
04:01:40,900 --> 04:01:45,140
out. And then like, you know, I go out and then something terrible happens. And I'm like, oh,

2952
04:01:46,340 --> 04:01:48,580
I saw, I listen, I listen to her a lot.

2953
04:01:52,820 --> 04:01:57,140
I listen to her a lot, because I'm just like, she knows something that I don't.

2954
04:01:59,140 --> 04:02:01,380
She knows something that I don't, I don't.

2955
04:02:06,420 --> 04:02:08,260
You know, it's just one of those things where I'm like,

2956
04:02:08,900 --> 04:02:12,660
okay, I don't know a whole lot about this, but I'm just going to listen to my mama.

2957
04:02:22,260 --> 04:02:23,140
That advice time.

2958
04:02:26,660 --> 04:02:30,500
Understood. Here is your advice. Don't be ugly.

2959
04:02:30,900 --> 04:02:38,900
You hear that, senpai? I hope this helps.

2960
04:02:46,660 --> 04:02:53,700
Sounds like a good advice to me. Solid advice.

2961
04:03:00,900 --> 04:03:09,220
Not gonna lie, my entire PC, Wi-Fi and power shut down, right? This is about how we talked about

2962
04:03:09,220 --> 04:03:17,460
tarot cards. Oh, shit. Yeah, I don't know, mama, it's probably a coincidence, but like, mama,

2963
04:03:17,460 --> 04:03:23,140
mama truly believes in that type of stuff. So I, I tend to listen to her because I feel like,

2964
04:03:23,140 --> 04:03:27,940
I don't know, you ever have the sage mother and father advice. And then you're just like,

2965
04:03:27,940 --> 04:03:32,340
yeah, they know something more than I do. So I'm just going to listen. I don't care if it sounds

2966
04:03:32,340 --> 04:03:46,580
kind of weird. I don't care if it sounds kind of weird or if it sounds like, you know, like

2967
04:03:47,300 --> 04:03:50,820
weird, bad, just, uh.

2968
04:03:59,380 --> 04:04:01,700
So I just listen, listen to mama.

2969
04:04:06,660 --> 04:04:10,900
But yeah, mama is trying to teach me to do Vietnamese fortune telling,

2970
04:04:10,900 --> 04:04:15,140
but it's so complex and I don't know certain words and I'm just like, I don't get it.

2971
04:04:15,780 --> 04:04:16,500
I don't get it.

2972
04:04:20,100 --> 04:04:25,220
I don't get it. This is hard. I just stuck with tarot cards instead because I was like, okay,

2973
04:04:25,220 --> 04:04:26,340
this I can understand.

2974
04:04:31,940 --> 04:04:34,340
Maybe a stream to practice? I don't know.

2975
04:04:34,340 --> 04:04:54,260
I would not allow mama, mama, modest to come teach on stream. I would not allow them. Listen,

2976
04:04:54,260 --> 04:05:01,860
if they asked me, honey, Netflix stopped working. Can you call them and tell them to make it work

2977
04:05:01,860 --> 04:05:05,460
again? You think I'm going to let them on stream?

2978
04:05:17,780 --> 04:05:25,940
Immediately, immediately, I would get Doc's hardcore. Are these your students, sweetie?

2979
04:05:26,900 --> 04:05:31,620
Hi from address, address, address, address, address, address.

2980
04:05:33,460 --> 04:05:34,980
How do you know my

2981
04:05:45,460 --> 04:05:51,380
Like I would be instantly Doc's. I could make an entire, listen, listen, listen.

2982
04:05:51,860 --> 04:06:06,020
Listen, it took me years and I have still not have succeeded in teaching Papa how to use a cell

2983
04:06:06,020 --> 04:06:18,420
phone, a flip phone. I, when I, I was like, here to pick up, you just open the phone and you know

2984
04:06:18,900 --> 04:06:20,340
what, what Papa did?

2985
04:06:24,260 --> 04:06:31,300
He said, okay, I got it. He opens the flip phone and closes it again and puts it against his

2986
04:06:31,300 --> 04:06:34,180
ear and goes, hello, it's not working.

2987
04:06:34,180 --> 04:07:01,700
Oh my gosh. And I, I didn't even know.

2988
04:07:04,980 --> 04:07:08,180
Do you know how hard it was to teach them how to use Netflix?

2989
04:07:09,860 --> 04:07:18,260
It was pretty hard and I taught them and I was only able to teach them because the, the little, uh,

2990
04:07:20,740 --> 04:07:27,140
the, the remote that come, I don't know, I think it was like a Blu-ray player

2991
04:07:27,940 --> 04:07:33,620
comes with the remote that says, that has a button that says Netflix.

2992
04:07:41,860 --> 04:07:48,180
And I just like, click this button, tap this button and it will take you to Netflix.

2993
04:07:50,820 --> 04:07:55,460
And then if you want to watch, watch anything, press these button and hit okay.

2994
04:07:56,420 --> 04:07:59,940
Okay. It took me a long time.

2995
04:08:03,460 --> 04:08:09,380
It took me a long time, but I managed to teach them how to use Netflix.

2996
04:08:13,220 --> 04:08:19,060
It's, it was tough. It was tough. So there is no way. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,

2997
04:08:20,020 --> 04:08:25,060
but you will not be able to meet my, my parents on stream.

2998
04:08:26,820 --> 04:08:32,820
I've tried multiple times to tell them what my job is and they said, oh, you teach. Oh, okay.

2999
04:08:32,820 --> 04:08:37,780
So you, you teach kids online how to speak English, right?

3000
04:08:41,220 --> 04:08:42,980
And at this point, I say, yeah, sure.

3001
04:08:42,980 --> 04:08:52,260
I just say, do they call you every time Netflix logs out the account? Yes. Yes, they do.

3002
04:08:56,660 --> 04:09:01,780
They do. If they go on the wrong profile, they start crying and telling me,

3003
04:09:01,780 --> 04:09:06,580
why isn't there old, their show that they were currently watching on this profile?

3004
04:09:06,580 --> 04:09:08,180
No.

3005
04:09:22,020 --> 04:09:26,020
But how will we ask them for your hand in marriage or lie? Well,

3006
04:09:26,020 --> 04:09:29,940
I already have a plan set up. So don't step out of it. Okay. Senpai.

3007
04:09:30,500 --> 04:09:42,100
So I was like, it's okay though. They think that every anime I watch is either Inuyash or

3008
04:09:42,100 --> 04:09:56,900
Sailor Moon cause I was obsessed with them as a kid. So please trust me. This is a,

3009
04:09:56,900 --> 04:10:07,860
this is a long process, but I promise Senpai, we'll have our happily ever after together.

3010
04:10:07,860 --> 04:10:26,340
Just trust, trust the process. Trust the process.

3011
04:10:30,020 --> 04:10:31,540
Don't worry, they'll meet you.

3012
04:10:31,540 --> 04:10:44,020
For now, though, they believe that you're my little student.

3013
04:11:01,780 --> 04:11:08,900
That's what they believe. You're my, you're my, you're my Senpai, but they believe that you're my

3014
04:11:08,900 --> 04:11:21,140
students. I think that's really funny though. I think it's really funny.

3015
04:11:21,140 --> 04:11:28,740
So remember, let's have a little secret together.

3016
04:11:51,140 --> 04:12:16,740
I still have to get used to my new, new routine.

3017
04:12:21,540 --> 04:12:26,340
I'm also sad. Wow.

3018
04:12:34,980 --> 04:12:41,540
I'll just, I'll just beat these guys first and then run to like a save point and then we'll do a

3019
04:12:41,540 --> 04:12:59,140
little chat and then I'll um, and then I'll, I'll head on.

3020
04:13:12,260 --> 04:13:15,140
So

3021
04:13:33,780 --> 04:13:35,780
that's the wrong way. I do have to go this way.

3022
04:13:36,500 --> 04:13:39,940
Through it, we're running.

3023
04:13:44,260 --> 04:13:44,500
Bye.

3024
04:13:50,420 --> 04:13:51,780
They know you're trying to leave.

3025
04:13:54,660 --> 04:14:02,180
They know they're, that I'm trying to leave and that they want me to stay just like my Senpai.

3026
04:14:03,140 --> 04:14:03,780
Right?

3027
04:14:06,900 --> 04:14:08,900
Okay. Yeah, let's save here.

3028
04:14:11,780 --> 04:14:12,180
Ooh.

3029
04:14:17,460 --> 04:14:19,380
Oh wait, everybody saved.

3030
04:14:23,140 --> 04:14:24,980
I forgot how to get to the menu again.

3031
04:14:32,180 --> 04:14:42,180
All right.

3032
04:14:52,340 --> 04:14:56,180
And close your eyes, Senpai. Flashbang.

3033
04:15:02,980 --> 04:15:14,180
Back to color.

3034
04:15:14,180 --> 04:15:24,180
Um, um, um.

3035
04:15:27,700 --> 04:15:34,100
Sorry I cough so, so much Senpai and like player might throw it a lot. I've been a bit sick.

3036
04:15:35,380 --> 04:15:42,660
Actually ever since before, the day before debut. I think I got a bit sick from basically stress.

3037
04:15:43,460 --> 04:15:47,700
Stress, nerves, all of the emotions rolled up into one.

3038
04:15:55,700 --> 04:15:58,180
So I've been, I've been coughing a little bit

3039
04:16:00,500 --> 04:16:05,620
and clearing my throat a little bit more. I do get a little bit flummy. So yeah.

3040
04:16:05,620 --> 04:16:13,140
Feeling better now? I think I'm getting to the tail end of it, but I still have like the cough and stuff.

3041
04:16:16,580 --> 04:16:21,620
I feel bad that I'm not always in my like tip top shape when uh, screaming.

3042
04:16:22,260 --> 04:16:38,500
Yeah. Yeah, debut was so stressful for me. When I first did debut, I was, I was, I wanted to make

3043
04:16:38,500 --> 04:16:49,540
such a good impression because I was worried that a lot of people would scrutinize the allure

3044
04:16:49,540 --> 04:16:56,900
more than usual. So I really tried my best. I tried my best to make a good first impression.

3045
04:17:04,500 --> 04:17:14,660
So yeah, and I was worried that, that you know, after debut, um, you know, people would be like,

3046
04:17:15,540 --> 04:17:20,420
would be, would scrutinize, scrutinize a little more as well.

3047
04:17:23,540 --> 04:17:28,420
So I was like, oh no, I have to impress my senpais. After all, I'm their kohai

3048
04:17:29,060 --> 04:17:35,140
and, and they'll need to love me and I'll be really sad if they don't like me.

3049
04:17:35,940 --> 04:17:49,300
So I'm really happy that I made, uh, at least a decent impression on my senpais.

3050
04:17:52,180 --> 04:17:54,580
Well, as long as, uh, everything's all good.

3051
04:17:57,300 --> 04:18:01,460
Okay, I leaned my arm onto this table so much, made an event.

3052
04:18:05,220 --> 04:18:11,860
So yeah, let's see if I have any, any news or something coming up. Let me take a look.

3053
04:18:11,860 --> 04:18:17,300
See, I know it's pretty light right now. Sorry for yapping so much about my family.

3054
04:18:21,780 --> 04:18:26,500
Here, let's see my schedule. Well, all my, I've, I've posted up all my schedule already.

3055
04:18:27,300 --> 04:18:30,660
I'm pretty, pretty cool with that.

3056
04:18:30,740 --> 04:18:40,500
Uh, okay, we have merch from Uwu Market. That's already done. Tomorrow is my

3057
04:18:43,460 --> 04:18:45,940
first ever ASMR stream.

3058
04:18:51,700 --> 04:18:56,260
It's my first ever ASMR stream, so I hope, uh, senpais will tune into that.

3059
04:18:57,140 --> 04:19:04,980
Am I a little nervous? Yeah, I'm a little nervous about it. Um, I had some things planned,

3060
04:19:04,980 --> 04:19:13,220
but because of, um, YouTube kind of cracking down on certain things, I'm going to have to just

3061
04:19:13,220 --> 04:19:22,100
readjust some things. Um, it's going to be safe for work. So have no worries about that. I'm not

3062
04:19:22,100 --> 04:19:29,860
going to go, you know, but I'm going to, uh,

3063
04:19:37,220 --> 04:19:39,860
I mean, is I'm here?

3064
04:19:40,740 --> 04:19:52,100
Oh, hi! I'm from Umapluses here. Wow. Umapluses is, uh, is another,

3065
04:19:52,820 --> 04:19:59,620
is, uh, is another, uh, V2 company that everyone should check out. Really cute girls.

3066
04:19:59,620 --> 04:20:18,180
Um, so, um, let's see, my, my ASMR stream is going to be, uh, a lot of pampering. I went out already.

3067
04:20:18,180 --> 04:20:25,860
I went out and got everyone, um, the kind of, the, the, the ice globe, the ice globe rollers,

3068
04:20:26,500 --> 04:20:34,020
and I've got, uh, a gel mask, uh, that I think makes a nice sound, I think. Um,

3069
04:20:42,180 --> 04:20:46,260
um, so I'm going to try to pamper, pamper my senpais.

3070
04:20:46,740 --> 04:20:52,820
Do you do heartbeat? Um, I'm not sure I'll do heartbeat.

3071
04:20:53,860 --> 04:21:03,060
Um, I think you'll have to go tomorrow to see what I'm planning. I'm not sure if it's going to be,

3072
04:21:04,100 --> 04:21:09,780
um, typical because I, I, to be honest, I'm just jumping and blinded.

3073
04:21:10,740 --> 04:21:19,300
Uh, to be honest, I'm jumping and blind, so I've, I've never really watched, um, other ASMR videos.

3074
04:21:22,020 --> 04:21:26,900
Yeah, it's going to be whispers. I promise you it'll be relaxing. It'll be relaxing whispers.

3075
04:21:30,740 --> 04:21:37,300
So, I, I haven't studied visually or auditorially because I don't know, I just,

3076
04:21:38,260 --> 04:21:44,580
I'm very sensitive to sound, so I, I have trouble studying, um, other people's videos, so I've been

3077
04:21:45,780 --> 04:21:51,300
kind of doing it in a way where I've been just reading about it.

3078
04:21:57,380 --> 04:22:01,860
So, I'm definitely going to pamper, pamper my, my senpais.

3079
04:22:02,020 --> 04:22:12,500
I'm going to pamper my senpais, but uh, don't worry though. I've been studying sometimes,

3080
04:22:12,500 --> 04:22:18,100
a lot of times. Strawny send me things if she's like, you need improvement in this area. Here,

3081
04:22:18,100 --> 04:22:23,620
here's an example. I do take the time to watch those videos that she sends me.

3082
04:22:24,420 --> 04:22:34,500
So, hopefully, uh, it works out. I'm going to see if it works. Let me know. Senpais, I hope you let me

3083
04:22:34,500 --> 04:22:44,020
know if something's, uh, too strong or too sensitive, so I'm not really sure, um, about how ASMR is,

3084
04:22:44,020 --> 04:22:49,380
but I did, I did some reading, I did some reading about it, so hopefully I'll do it in my own little way.

3085
04:22:54,020 --> 04:23:00,260
If it's Strawny, those are probably some interesting training videos.

3086
04:23:02,020 --> 04:23:03,860
Am I allowed to say this?

3087
04:23:08,420 --> 04:23:15,380
Sometimes Strawny's like, nope, that wasn't good enough. Here, go practice.

3088
04:23:15,380 --> 04:23:25,140
And then I would have to re-record and stuff.

3089
04:23:25,140 --> 04:23:44,260
Strawny, Strawny, um, definitely is, is, uh, guiding me, guiding me a lot.

3090
04:23:44,340 --> 04:24:00,500
So, um, if something, there's, there's one I know, I'm not very proud of my very first,

3091
04:24:00,500 --> 04:24:06,820
one of my very first audios for Patreon. I'm not very proud of, so what if you, if you hear it?

3092
04:24:07,780 --> 04:24:10,900
I think I did an okay job on it, but I feel like I

3093
04:24:13,460 --> 04:24:18,420
would, I would improve, I should improve more. I'm learning from my mistakes,

3094
04:24:18,420 --> 04:24:23,060
so I feel like it's not, it's not the best quality, it's because I am a beginner.

3095
04:24:23,860 --> 04:24:39,620
Enjoy learning? Of course, I enjoy learning. It's, it's a part of my likes, my hobbies.

3096
04:24:39,620 --> 04:24:45,700
I love research, I love learning. I very much have kind of like a research-esque mind.

3097
04:24:53,060 --> 04:25:01,620
So yeah, uh, please understand if, if there's any harsh comments, uh, this, uh, when I first recorded

3098
04:25:01,620 --> 04:25:11,380
all of those, uh, all of those, uh, recordings were definitely, uh, a month plus in advance.

3099
04:25:12,180 --> 04:25:18,980
So, the following month should be better, but I think it might be, I think I'm still,

3100
04:25:19,060 --> 04:25:21,860
still learning, so I'll try to improve over time.

3101
04:25:25,220 --> 04:25:31,300
The first audio was good, good. I think that one was, I think I found a little more confident in

3102
04:25:31,300 --> 04:25:44,980
that one. In, in, in that one, uh, so Strani's definitely helping me. The other girls, girls,

3103
04:25:45,540 --> 04:25:51,780
uh, are definitely helping me as well. So yeah, uh, I think a lot of us are, are definitely noobs,

3104
04:25:51,780 --> 04:25:59,860
but I think, uh, they've, they've dabbled, they've dabbled in, in ASMR a little bit more than me.

3105
04:25:59,860 --> 04:26:06,340
Me, I, I'm completely new, I'm completely new, so I'm just like, oh okay, Strani's, Strani's has taught

3106
04:26:06,340 --> 04:26:20,180
me in her own way. Um, yeah. Azura said she's new too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think Azura is not

3107
04:26:20,180 --> 04:26:23,700
ignorant. When I came in, I was like, I don't even know what a trigger is.

3108
04:26:37,060 --> 04:26:40,980
I was like, trigger? Like, oh my devil trigger.

3109
04:26:46,340 --> 04:26:48,820
Oh, like a gun trigger. Is that a popular race?

3110
04:26:59,700 --> 04:27:04,340
Is there a way would you like feedback structured or would you let, let you go on your own pace?

3111
04:27:05,060 --> 04:27:12,180
Um, I think Strani and I know where my weaknesses are, but I don't mind a little bit of constructive

3112
04:27:12,180 --> 04:27:18,420
criticism, but not mean criticism. I will cry. And if I go, if I cry, uh, someone's gonna pay for it.

3113
04:27:24,100 --> 04:27:25,300
I hope that makes sense.

3114
04:27:25,300 --> 04:27:38,980
Uh, you can give my feedback through my moral. It's fine. I do read through my morals. I'm sorry

3115
04:27:38,980 --> 04:27:43,540
I haven't really replied to a lot of them. I, I have been reading all of them though, but a lot

3116
04:27:43,540 --> 04:27:47,140
of questions that have been coming in have been things I've already addressed. So I was like,

3117
04:27:47,140 --> 04:27:54,900
I don't know if I should answer this or I'm, or I'm shy about answering because some of them are very,

3118
04:27:54,900 --> 04:28:03,860
if you are very personal and I'm just like, uh, I'm very thankful and they're, they're mine.

3119
04:28:03,860 --> 04:28:08,180
They're mine and only mine. No, I'm not even Senpai gets to see my reaction.

3120
04:28:15,060 --> 04:28:20,900
What limits do you have on questions mask? No, you mean, what do you mean?

3121
04:28:25,460 --> 04:28:28,660
Like, what questions do I not like?

3122
04:28:32,100 --> 04:28:38,100
Um, I guess questions that blushing mercy. Yeah. If I read some of them, I'm like,

3123
04:28:43,220 --> 04:28:49,940
what do you want us to not ask about? Well, if things have are, are kind of easily findable.

3124
04:28:50,820 --> 04:28:55,380
So like, if you're like, oh, do you play hentai games or arrow gay?

3125
04:28:57,060 --> 04:29:04,020
Well, I address that in my debut. Um, if I, if, oh, do you like this anime and it's in my debut,

3126
04:29:04,020 --> 04:29:07,540
I'm going to be really, I get a little, I get a little miffed, you know?

3127
04:29:11,860 --> 04:29:18,020
I get a little miffed if someone asks me, how do I, uh, if they ask me a question about how

3128
04:29:18,100 --> 04:29:21,620
the internal system works? I don't know. That's a question for strongy.

3129
04:29:25,380 --> 04:29:34,340
So risk a questions are fine for you. Yes. Uh, although I may not answer it because, um, it's a journey.

3130
04:29:37,540 --> 04:29:39,140
It's a journey. It's a journey for me.

3131
04:29:48,820 --> 04:30:01,140
So, uh, yeah, kayfabe questions are okay. I feel a little bad because I dropped kayfabe a lot.

3132
04:30:08,500 --> 04:30:09,140
Um,

3133
04:30:10,100 --> 04:30:26,820
yeah, I feel like most questions are free and on the table if, oh, I know some questions that I don't

3134
04:30:26,820 --> 04:30:31,540
like. I've been recently getting questions that I don't like, that I know that I don't like. I feel

3135
04:30:31,540 --> 04:30:40,420
like they're baiting for me to answer in order to, to induce some rage. And I don't like that.

3136
04:30:43,220 --> 04:30:46,820
I don't like that. And I think those are not my senpais. I think those are trolls.

3137
04:30:53,060 --> 04:31:00,020
I think those are trolls. So I don't like that. I don't like questions about, um,

3138
04:31:01,700 --> 04:31:06,580
like pineapple and pizza kind of question. No, no, no, like, uh,

3139
04:31:09,780 --> 04:31:11,860
more offensive questions, you know?

3140
04:31:16,980 --> 04:31:24,260
So, like pineapple and pizza, by the way, is good. My favorite pizza is pineapple in

3141
04:31:24,260 --> 04:31:27,780
my room. So anyone else can fight me. You can try.

3142
04:31:34,740 --> 04:31:37,780
But like questions that are definitely, um,

3143
04:31:43,700 --> 04:31:49,620
definitely questions that are definitely trying to get a riot out of me or someone else. Does that

3144
04:31:49,700 --> 04:31:59,060
make sense? So I don't like political questions. I don't like, um, questions about,

3145
04:32:00,020 --> 04:32:10,180
like, personal things about me. So, um, no, let's just, I, I've, instead, I haven't seen

3146
04:32:10,180 --> 04:32:17,940
any of my morals yet, but I've had people ask me questions in the past where it's like,

3147
04:32:17,940 --> 04:32:24,500
where do you live? Tell me where you live. What's your phone number? I want to give you a call,

3148
04:32:24,500 --> 04:32:33,620
personal call. That type of thing. I don't like things by invading my privacy. So those are

3149
04:32:34,180 --> 04:32:38,100
kind of like, I feel like it's kind of common. These are common questions.

3150
04:32:39,060 --> 04:32:50,980
But I definitely don't like questions that are like, you know, trolls and stuff. So,

3151
04:32:53,940 --> 04:32:58,820
yeah, so it's, it's kind of like the basic etiquettes. Just remember basic etiquettes and

3152
04:32:58,820 --> 04:33:04,500
most likely I will, I will answer it or I will keep that question in my mind to answer in the

3153
04:33:04,500 --> 04:33:11,140
future because maybe I don't know. I don't know. And I'm, I'm still discovering pieces of myself as

3154
04:33:11,140 --> 04:33:23,060
well. So for example, I don't know how to, like, if someone says, what are you into? I feel like

3155
04:33:24,820 --> 04:33:29,940
the, that question's a little hard for me because I don't really know what I'm into.

3156
04:33:30,500 --> 04:33:34,500
And I'm also slowly discovering what I'm into and what I'm not into, I guess.

3157
04:33:38,100 --> 04:33:39,620
Like, yeah.

3158
04:33:42,900 --> 04:33:47,700
Those questions are fine. I just feel like I don't have the ability to answer them now.

3159
04:33:47,700 --> 04:33:50,500
I don't have the knowledge of myself to answer them now.

3160
04:33:53,620 --> 04:33:54,260
Things like that.

3161
04:33:55,220 --> 04:34:01,140
So, we're all, we're all learning together. And then once I find out if I don't like something,

3162
04:34:01,140 --> 04:34:02,260
I'll let you know.

3163
04:34:07,620 --> 04:34:12,500
It's like trying food, you know, I'm still trying a lot of food. So I don't really know, like, oh,

3164
04:34:12,500 --> 04:34:18,100
I do like this, but, oh, do you, I've never tried this before. So I don't know if I like it or not.

3165
04:34:24,260 --> 04:34:34,740
That makes us your students. Your mom was 100% on our prediction. I think it's more like

3166
04:34:35,380 --> 04:34:40,580
senpais are teaching me, I think. I think my senpais are more like mentoring me.

3167
04:34:46,580 --> 04:34:52,820
I know my mods are supposed to be silent, but I thank you for my mods as well. I see a lot of

3168
04:34:53,460 --> 04:34:59,700
senpais also show appreciation for them. So thank you. Thank you mods. Shut up, but also thank you.

3169
04:35:05,380 --> 04:35:07,700
I truly, I truly do appreciate the hard work.

3170
04:35:23,380 --> 04:35:32,500
So I really appreciate them. Shout outs, shout outs to mods.

3171
04:35:39,780 --> 04:35:43,060
Especially when I say things like cut off his testicles.

3172
04:35:43,060 --> 04:35:48,340
My lesson to me. I'm so appreciative of that.

3173
04:35:54,020 --> 04:35:55,380
No, they're doing really good.

3174
04:36:02,500 --> 04:36:10,660
Good. But yeah, I appreciate it. This is actually my first time talking to so many people as well.

3175
04:36:10,660 --> 04:36:16,900
So I appreciate having all the help that I can get, especially the, my gen mates help me a lot,

3176
04:36:16,900 --> 04:36:20,340
and scrawny helps me a lot, and manager helps me a lot.

3177
04:36:29,220 --> 04:36:34,420
Mods destroy them. Next time I'll be like, oh, look, I pulled out my mods card.

3178
04:36:34,980 --> 04:36:37,700
Maw moderators obliterate.

3179
04:36:51,460 --> 04:36:53,060
Put mods in attack mode.

3180
04:36:53,060 --> 04:37:14,740
And I put one of my mods face down.

3181
04:37:23,060 --> 04:37:37,380
Wait, do you actually know Yu-Gi-Oh? I've only watched the anime. I've never really played it.

3182
04:37:37,380 --> 04:37:50,740
I don't know how to play like Yu-Gi-Oh Yu-Gi-Oh, but I've only watched the anime. I think the first season.

3183
04:37:53,780 --> 04:38:17,060
So I only know a few cards as well, mostly Exodia. In fact, I have like, do you guys know that collab

3184
04:38:17,060 --> 04:38:26,260
with Hello Kitty? The McDonald's collab? Hello Kitty? And it's like the Yu-Gi-Oh Hello Kitty

3185
04:38:26,260 --> 04:38:35,220
collab? I have like, on one of my, one of my lights here. I forgot to turn off my lights,

3186
04:38:35,220 --> 04:38:47,380
turned on my lights today, but one of my lights here is a pom-pom pudding Exodia.

3187
04:38:54,100 --> 04:38:59,940
Yeah, that's Hello Kitty with Yu-Gi-Oh's hair. It's hilarious, right? So I have, I have that one.

3188
04:39:00,500 --> 04:39:06,180
I have, that's the one I wanted. That's the one I wanted. I also have,

3189
04:39:07,060 --> 04:39:12,900
wow, this one I'm going to give to a friend of mine. I have Pochakko as the time wizard.

3190
04:39:13,860 --> 04:39:22,500
And I have my melody as a dark magician girl. And I also have

3191
04:39:23,140 --> 04:39:32,900
um, uh, the cinnamon roll blue eyes my dragon. What's your favorite Hello Kitty character,

3192
04:39:32,900 --> 04:39:39,380
Kohai? Um, pom-pom pudding. I love, I love pom-pom pudding's butthole. I think it's a charm point.

3193
04:39:39,380 --> 04:39:50,580
I think it's cute. What? What do you mean? No one knows about the butthole? Everyone,

3194
04:39:50,580 --> 04:40:00,260
look at pom-pom pudding's butthole. I think it's cute. If a product does not have the butthole,

3195
04:40:00,260 --> 04:40:11,620
I do not buy it. I do not buy it. Um, my second favorites are probably Little Twin Stars. I think

3196
04:40:11,620 --> 04:40:26,500
they're cute. Is my end area Hello Kitty girl? Um, I don't own a lot of Hello Kitty stuff. I do

3197
04:40:26,500 --> 04:40:33,780
like Hello Kitty, but I don't own a lot of Hello Kitty stuff. So if, for example, uh, I don't just

3198
04:40:33,780 --> 04:40:40,580
buy things because it's Hello Kitty or anything. To be honest, I'm kind of like trying to not really

3199
04:40:40,580 --> 04:40:45,540
want a lot of things. So the things on my wish list are kind of like things that I've been like

3200
04:40:45,540 --> 04:40:53,380
thinking about a lot or just a tiny treat. Uh, mostly from, I think a lot of them are just things

3201
04:40:53,380 --> 04:41:07,460
that I, I think will improve my stream. So things that will help improve my stream. So, uh, right

3202
04:41:07,460 --> 04:41:16,580
now, uh, the Senpai, thank you Senpais for gifting me things, uh, so far. Um, I'm still reading through

3203
04:41:16,580 --> 04:41:25,060
it. I, I'm actually, I recently received a, uh, the, the nausea, uh, bracelet thing. So hopefully

3204
04:41:25,060 --> 04:41:31,220
it works out for some streams so that I can, I can use that. I'll test that out for streams, uh,

3205
04:41:31,300 --> 04:41:38,180
for first person stuff. Uh, the blanket is already behind me. It's kind of airing out right now,

3206
04:41:38,820 --> 04:41:43,220
because it's, it's kind of, it arrived kind of like with the factory sense. So I'm, I'm airing it

3207
04:41:43,220 --> 04:41:49,780
out a little bit. Um, it's working great right now. If it's working great, if you can hear my audio,

3208
04:41:50,740 --> 04:41:57,300
um, I'm kind of, I'm kind of happy with my audio. I'm happy with my audio,

3209
04:41:57,540 --> 04:42:02,660
with my audio setup right now. I think it's pretty good. I think it's pretty good. Uh,

3210
04:42:04,420 --> 04:42:09,700
I've covered some areas where I think, uh, has a little bit of a reverberation. I've,

3211
04:42:09,700 --> 04:42:14,420
I've covered those areas. So I think, I think it's pretty good now. I think, uh, mind you,

3212
04:42:14,420 --> 04:42:19,700
the space I'm in right now that I can only fit myself in is like kind of, is the open area in

3213
04:42:19,700 --> 04:42:28,580
the basement is the open area in the basement. So there's like stairs here and like lots of

3214
04:42:28,580 --> 04:42:40,820
crevices and stuff. So I'm trying my best. I'm trying my best. I tried my best to sound, uh,

3215
04:42:40,900 --> 04:42:49,620
as, as good as possible for my supplies. Um, yeah, I'm raining through some of the manuals for some

3216
04:42:49,620 --> 04:42:55,620
stuff. Uh, everything arrived. Everything, everything's arrived. So yeah.

3217
04:42:59,780 --> 04:43:05,300
Thought the Ku 100 mic, isn't that like $8,000? Now it's way more than that.

3218
04:43:05,860 --> 04:43:09,860
Uh, I put an LOL on that. It was kind of a joke. It was kind of a joke.

3219
04:43:13,860 --> 04:43:19,860
It's a, it's more of a joke. I put it there for like, ha ha, look at me. I'm so passionate about ASMR.

3220
04:43:22,820 --> 04:43:28,820
There's a reason why in there it says, uh, it says LOL.

3221
04:43:28,820 --> 04:43:38,420
You say that until it's bought. I don't think anyone's going to buy that, to be honest.

3222
04:43:39,380 --> 04:43:43,220
Do you guys think, uh, I should take it off then?

3223
04:43:44,660 --> 04:43:47,860
You should take it off the list then? I put it there as like kind of like a,

3224
04:43:48,580 --> 04:44:01,780
uh, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm experimenting and I hear it's pretty good, but it's, it's quite a big upgrade.

3225
04:44:07,220 --> 04:44:11,700
I think, uh, if I had to choose one thing that I would really, really, really want,

3226
04:44:11,700 --> 04:44:18,420
would be the U87. I think I would really love the U87 more than the Ku 100.

3227
04:44:28,180 --> 04:44:36,260
Keep it on, keep it on, keep it, take it off. Maybe, maybe I should take it off.

3228
04:44:36,260 --> 04:44:39,780
I don't know. I feel a little guilty for putting it on because I, uh, maybe that,

3229
04:44:40,340 --> 04:44:45,940
I put the precedence on, um, someone, someone to, to try to get it.

3230
04:44:54,100 --> 04:44:57,140
Yeah, I'll probably remove it. Heck, I'll remove it right now.

3231
04:44:57,140 --> 04:45:12,020
Whoa, I can remove it right now. Don't worry, Sunpie.

3232
04:45:16,340 --> 04:45:19,220
There you go. It's gone into the ether.

3233
04:45:27,140 --> 04:45:35,860
It's gone now. Excuse me. Wow.

3234
04:45:44,980 --> 04:45:49,220
But yeah, um, my wishlist stuff, yeah.

3235
04:45:49,220 --> 04:45:50,420
Haha.

3236
04:45:56,580 --> 04:45:57,300
Vanished.

3237
04:46:02,500 --> 04:46:06,180
Are you okay? Hi, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. I just feel I'm still a little bit of sick,

3238
04:46:06,180 --> 04:46:10,660
so I will get like, plummy and coffee all the time, all the, every once in a while.

3239
04:46:13,300 --> 04:46:18,820
It's also pretty cold in the basement, so I get pretty sick easily in the basement.

3240
04:46:19,220 --> 04:46:21,880
I'm streaming like right beside all my supplies

3241
04:46:23,900 --> 04:46:25,900
Yeah, I sent it to the shadow realm

3242
04:46:26,300 --> 04:46:27,980
That's a tea by the way

3243
04:46:27,980 --> 04:46:32,500
Good, but it's so cold down here. Like usually these mugs can hold

3244
04:46:35,940 --> 04:46:37,580
Can hold like

3245
04:46:37,580 --> 04:46:41,300
Heat for a while, but because it's so cold down here. It can get

3246
04:46:42,140 --> 04:46:44,720
Really fast and go get cold really fast

3247
04:46:45,500 --> 04:46:51,140
Yeah, we know it's cold. I provided lots of blankets

3248
04:46:57,360 --> 04:47:03,460
Yeah, you're about to hit the five hour mark. Oh shit. I'm such a yapper. I'm sorry

3249
04:47:09,360 --> 04:47:11,660
Can we try using a thermos for your tea I

3250
04:47:12,460 --> 04:47:14,460
I didn't think about that

3251
04:47:20,380 --> 04:47:23,320
I was like I do have a thermos as far soup though

3252
04:47:24,780 --> 04:47:29,340
But I'm also like I kind of wanted to cool it down a little bit. I may be at thermos might be too hot

3253
04:47:29,340 --> 04:47:31,340
I

3254
04:47:42,620 --> 04:47:48,380
Don't worry. I already have one. I already have a thermos. I bought it for soups. I actually bought it for school

3255
04:47:49,100 --> 04:47:51,420
Uh, I ended up not using it for school

3256
04:47:54,700 --> 04:47:57,420
So I guess I was saving it for camping or something

3257
04:48:00,300 --> 04:48:07,900
I'm camping with senpai. Let me know the forest. Don't worry about the barrel and the bone saw and

3258
04:48:08,300 --> 04:48:10,460
you know the copulous amount of

3259
04:48:12,300 --> 04:48:13,740
Acid

3260
04:48:13,740 --> 04:48:19,820
That I'm bringing along. I don't look good. I don't like that. Do you like camping? I do like the outdoors. I

3261
04:48:21,180 --> 04:48:23,180
Like the outdoors. It's calming

3262
04:48:29,740 --> 04:48:35,740
Someone said they found a bone while we were cleaning our ping-pong mess earlier. Oh, don't worry about it

3263
04:48:42,780 --> 04:48:44,780
This isn't in the beach this is an acid bag

3264
04:48:44,780 --> 04:48:46,780
I

3265
04:48:57,500 --> 04:49:05,100
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. But yeah, yeah, I'll take I'll take it off most things. I just kind of want or

3266
04:49:07,580 --> 04:49:09,180
Or I

3267
04:49:09,180 --> 04:49:11,820
It's things to improve the screen except for the size of fumo

3268
04:49:11,820 --> 04:49:17,340
That's kind of like a want because I don't know. I don't have a lot of saw. I'm a really big fan of siren outa

3269
04:49:20,620 --> 04:49:23,020
A new plan on keeping us from running off in the forest

3270
04:49:28,140 --> 04:49:30,140
Ah

3271
04:49:31,180 --> 04:49:36,940
Sometimes, you know, maybe a little broken ankle might might hurt hurt your chances a little bit

3272
04:49:42,060 --> 04:49:44,060
I

3273
04:49:55,100 --> 04:49:59,420
Give you a head start not without a handicap, of course

3274
04:49:59,420 --> 04:50:01,420
I

3275
04:50:10,860 --> 04:50:12,860
Don't want to run. Yeah

3276
04:50:20,700 --> 04:50:25,580
Well, if you don't want to run then we'll have a good time because then I'll be like camping and then we'll have s'mores and like

3277
04:50:25,900 --> 04:50:27,260
We'll roast

3278
04:50:27,260 --> 04:50:31,660
Roast things over a fire and tell camp stories and stuff. But if you want to run

3279
04:50:32,540 --> 04:50:34,540
I'll give you a head start

3280
04:50:37,340 --> 04:50:39,340
But you know

3281
04:50:40,700 --> 04:50:42,700
Maybe the animals will find you first

3282
04:50:47,660 --> 04:50:51,260
Whatever happened in the og senpai check out the lore video

3283
04:50:56,460 --> 04:50:58,460
I

3284
04:50:58,460 --> 04:51:05,100
Think like if we roast like, you know things over like I would love I would love to have like sweet potatoes

3285
04:51:05,820 --> 04:51:08,460
Over an open fire. I'll be really nice

3286
04:51:19,900 --> 04:51:24,140
So I think that'll be really nice to to have and like maybe have like our own little like

3287
04:51:24,540 --> 04:51:26,540
Fire pit barbecue wouldn't that be nice?

3288
04:51:32,220 --> 04:51:34,220
Is this a plan for a date of course

3289
04:51:37,660 --> 04:51:40,940
And then we can look at the stars together wouldn't that be nice

3290
04:51:49,180 --> 04:51:52,620
Like real sweet potatoes are really nice. I love it. I love it a lot

3291
04:51:54,620 --> 04:51:56,620
So

3292
04:51:57,020 --> 04:52:00,060
But if you if if senpai's decided to start running

3293
04:52:01,100 --> 04:52:03,980
Wow, I did bring some stuff to to help

3294
04:52:15,500 --> 04:52:20,460
Oh, there'll be beer. I don't really like beer actually. I don't really like drinking or

3295
04:52:21,260 --> 04:52:24,060
Any any vices really

3296
04:52:25,100 --> 04:52:29,820
It makes my senses go dull and I don't like that. I like to be alert at all times

3297
04:52:32,620 --> 04:52:34,780
I like root beer though. Yeah, root beer is okay

3298
04:52:36,860 --> 04:52:43,260
I think I got a really bad memory. Um when I was in college

3299
04:52:43,340 --> 04:52:50,780
Um, I went to the local like the student the student

3300
04:52:51,580 --> 04:52:54,940
our pub, I don't know. I don't know the difference to be honest

3301
04:52:55,740 --> 04:52:57,660
um

3302
04:52:57,660 --> 04:53:01,100
and I yeah, I was with a a group of uh

3303
04:53:02,860 --> 04:53:04,860
group of classmates and

3304
04:53:06,540 --> 04:53:11,660
Ended up leaving because I hate I hated it. I hated it. So the beer came

3305
04:53:12,620 --> 04:53:14,620
Uh

3306
04:53:15,260 --> 04:53:17,260
beer came and

3307
04:53:17,660 --> 04:53:19,100
Okay, uh

3308
04:53:19,100 --> 04:53:23,900
It was poured out into the drinks and it'll be my first time trying beer. It's like, oh, I've never tried beer before

3309
04:53:27,020 --> 04:53:33,020
I swear it smelled like piss it was warm

3310
04:53:35,020 --> 04:53:37,020
It was warm

3311
04:53:37,580 --> 04:53:43,340
It smelled really bad and when I tasted it it tasted like, you know

3312
04:53:45,020 --> 04:53:50,380
P and I was like the fucking person who served this to us like just pissing a jug

3313
04:53:50,380 --> 04:53:52,380
Look

3314
04:54:01,420 --> 04:54:06,140
Great, have you tried tried pee it tasted like what pee smells like

3315
04:54:10,060 --> 04:54:13,980
So it was like warm and it felt it looked like

3316
04:54:15,580 --> 04:54:17,660
P and I was like

3317
04:54:21,340 --> 04:54:23,340
Ah

3318
04:54:31,660 --> 04:54:36,380
It's just smells bad and it was warm and then I I was like

3319
04:54:38,220 --> 04:54:45,180
I asked I asked I asked the the staff I was like this is this normally served warm and they're like

3320
04:54:45,180 --> 04:54:49,820
Yeah, beers normally served warm like it's best. Uh, it's best uh

3321
04:54:50,700 --> 04:54:52,940
beer tastes best at like when it's like

3322
04:54:53,820 --> 04:54:56,140
You know warm and I was like

3323
04:55:01,020 --> 04:55:03,520
I'm gonna pay for my part and I'm gonna leave

3324
04:55:16,140 --> 04:55:18,140
I

3325
04:55:21,180 --> 04:55:30,700
I uh I left I left I I literally almost threw up in that cup. I like spat it out

3326
04:55:39,020 --> 04:55:41,020
Uh, I spat it out so I

3327
04:55:41,100 --> 04:55:43,100
I

3328
04:55:43,100 --> 04:55:49,500
I I I uh that was my first interaction with beer and I've never liked beer ever since

3329
04:55:53,340 --> 04:55:56,940
I've never liked beer ever since so if anyone just offers me beer

3330
04:55:57,020 --> 04:56:02,140
I just think of that moment even if it's cold. I still taste like I drink it. I'm like

3331
04:56:04,460 --> 04:56:06,460
You just like alcohols, um

3332
04:56:07,180 --> 04:56:10,220
I don't dislike it, but I tend to avoid alcohol

3333
04:56:11,340 --> 04:56:17,420
It it uh dulls the senses and if it dulls the senses, I can't I can't

3334
04:56:19,420 --> 04:56:22,620
Be at my peak around my senpai's

3335
04:56:26,780 --> 04:56:33,900
Like um if I'm around my gal pals my my friends, uh, we'll probably drink a little bit of like

3336
04:56:33,980 --> 04:56:38,620
I don't know like a long island iced tea something sweet, you know or like those

3337
04:56:39,500 --> 04:56:49,020
Baileys or something, but I uh last time I went drinking with workers. I uh got shit-based and uh

3338
04:56:50,060 --> 04:56:54,380
I'm not a good drunk. Let's just say I'm not a good drunk

3339
04:56:58,620 --> 04:57:05,340
Um, yeah, I'm not a good drunk. I think I told them I hated them or something

3340
04:57:08,940 --> 04:57:14,940
I hated them and then I hated my work and everything in front of the my boss. So let's let's not just oh, yeah, it's not

3341
04:57:16,940 --> 04:57:18,940
It's not good

3342
04:57:18,940 --> 04:57:20,940
so, uh

3343
04:57:21,820 --> 04:57:24,300
Did you hate them um sometimes I did

3344
04:57:28,060 --> 04:57:30,060
Sometimes I did so

3345
04:57:32,140 --> 04:57:37,180
I guess those feelings, you know one of frustrations when I was frustrated with my co-workers

3346
04:57:37,900 --> 04:57:39,900
um

3347
04:57:40,060 --> 04:57:45,020
Yeah, I'm gonna so if anyone asked for a drinking stream that's not happening

3348
04:57:49,420 --> 04:57:56,300
Well, will you tell us if you were drunk with us? I probably just bitch about how you keep on trying to run away from me

3349
04:58:00,860 --> 04:58:03,420
I was the next day at work that was my last day at work

3350
04:58:04,300 --> 04:58:08,300
We were doing a drinking celebration for my last day of work

3351
04:58:09,100 --> 04:58:11,100
I just went

3352
04:58:31,980 --> 04:58:33,980
Uh, so I uh, I don't drink

3353
04:58:34,940 --> 04:58:39,660
I don't drink and the last time and the time before that when I drunk I

3354
04:58:40,540 --> 04:58:43,180
uh sober I was sober in front of

3355
04:58:44,220 --> 04:58:50,860
The in front of the toilet uh with my barfinette. So I was like, uh, you know what?

3356
04:58:51,580 --> 04:58:53,580
Screw drinking

3357
04:58:55,180 --> 04:58:57,180
Screw screw drinking

3358
04:59:01,740 --> 04:59:03,740
So I don't like drinking

3359
04:59:04,220 --> 04:59:06,220
I

3360
04:59:06,460 --> 04:59:11,740
Yeah, so I I I prefer to keep my health up, especially since my health isn't the greatest

3361
04:59:20,700 --> 04:59:24,780
I guess my biggest vice would be like the occasional drunk food

3362
04:59:26,780 --> 04:59:28,620
Like um

3363
04:59:28,700 --> 04:59:36,220
I know like mama mama and papa's favorite celebration food is it's fried chicken and I do like fried chicken too

3364
04:59:52,140 --> 04:59:57,020
So yeah, I I was like I don't like, uh, I don't like drinking

3365
04:59:58,620 --> 05:00:00,620
So

3366
05:00:02,300 --> 05:00:09,100
Yeah, uh like, uh, we're basically like birthdays and stuff are celebrated with fried chicken

3367
05:00:17,500 --> 05:00:22,140
So I don't really I don't drink I do keep some

3368
05:00:23,100 --> 05:00:28,300
I've already reached five hours. Congratulations to me. Not not my record, but

3369
05:00:31,020 --> 05:00:32,460
Um

3370
05:00:32,460 --> 05:00:40,940
I do keep some drinks around with me or like, uh, if my gal pals if we're having like a a girly sleepover

3371
05:00:42,220 --> 05:00:48,060
We're having a girly sleepover. They want they want a little drink. Uh, I I I I I keep some just in case

3372
05:00:48,380 --> 05:00:58,940
Seven hours to beat strannies strannies records strannies record is 12 hours. What are you talking about?

3373
05:01:04,140 --> 05:01:07,020
I I do have a lot of endurance yesterday though, I definitely

3374
05:01:07,660 --> 05:01:14,300
Didn't have a lot of endurance probably because before I was doing the the 2.0 and I was really stressed

3375
05:01:19,020 --> 05:01:27,500
Oh seven hours to go five plus seven. Wow. I'm so stupid. See this is why I hate numbers. I can't do math

3376
05:01:33,420 --> 05:01:38,300
But yeah, if senpais like, uh, beer and stuff I will provide beer

3377
05:01:39,180 --> 05:01:43,740
Or like a drink for my senpais, but I won't participate myself

3378
05:01:44,700 --> 05:01:49,020
Are you still feeling tired? I'm still feeling tired, but I'm a yapper. It's like

3379
05:01:49,820 --> 05:01:53,740
You ever keep talking while you're you're like in bed

3380
05:01:54,540 --> 05:01:56,380
with your friends

3381
05:01:56,380 --> 05:02:01,740
I don't I don't know if this is a universal thing, but you're like still chatting with your friends on discord or something

3382
05:02:01,740 --> 05:02:04,460
And you still have the energy, but you're like, I'm so freaking tired

3383
05:02:14,540 --> 05:02:16,540
So, yeah, um

3384
05:02:25,980 --> 05:02:28,620
I know I know people find it like weird, but like

3385
05:02:29,580 --> 05:02:33,900
Uh, I like sleepovers with my my my my gal pals

3386
05:02:34,780 --> 05:02:36,300
so uh

3387
05:02:36,300 --> 05:02:41,020
Some uh, we'll lay like a little futon for the floor for some girls

3388
05:02:41,820 --> 05:02:47,980
Girls to sleep down on the floor or and then there's a bed that everyone can share as well

3389
05:02:52,460 --> 05:02:53,900
So, yeah

3390
05:02:53,900 --> 05:02:56,140
I don't know. I don't know if most people do that

3391
05:02:56,220 --> 05:03:01,900
But like that's like a thing that my friends do and then we we stay up and then we talk about our lives and we talk

3392
05:03:01,980 --> 05:03:03,980
About anything maybe theory

3393
05:03:04,460 --> 05:03:06,620
Maybe we watch, uh cartoons

3394
05:03:07,100 --> 05:03:09,900
Uh, like we marathon cartoons and stuff

3395
05:03:11,580 --> 05:03:13,580
So

3396
05:03:15,180 --> 05:03:20,860
What do you guys talk about these secret gal pals sleepovers? Oh, yeah, we like summon demons and sacrifice

3397
05:03:21,660 --> 05:03:25,180
Sacrifice are uh a galt just kidding

3398
05:03:41,980 --> 05:03:49,740
It's terrifying right now. Stop. I do hope be allure has have an off collab sleepover

3399
05:03:50,060 --> 05:03:54,940
I really do hope like that. I I really want to like hang out with the girls. Maybe we can do our nails and stuff

3400
05:04:00,700 --> 05:04:03,340
It might take a while though since we're we've got to

3401
05:04:05,020 --> 05:04:08,620
Congregate at one at one place and I'm gonna guess

3402
05:04:09,500 --> 05:04:15,020
We congregate at one place was probably gonna be at scrawny's place. So it might take a little bit of a while

3403
05:04:31,420 --> 05:04:33,420
So I think uh

3404
05:04:34,140 --> 05:04:39,180
No, I think I think we're most likely to likely to go to scrawny's

3405
05:04:39,740 --> 05:04:41,740
uh

3406
05:04:41,980 --> 05:04:43,980
Maybe um

3407
05:04:46,380 --> 05:04:50,620
I'd probably have to rent out if they come to me I'd have to rent out a b&b

3408
05:04:51,900 --> 05:04:55,660
Uh air b&b or or book a hotel room or something

3409
05:04:56,380 --> 05:04:57,660
but

3410
05:04:57,660 --> 05:04:59,660
uh

3411
05:05:00,540 --> 05:05:05,020
But if we go to anywhere anywhere else we'll probably have to do something similar like that

3412
05:05:07,740 --> 05:05:12,300
I mean if off of you allure girls it might be a far travel for some of them as well

3413
05:05:16,220 --> 05:05:18,220
I'm sure it'll be fine

3414
05:05:18,540 --> 05:05:19,500
um

3415
05:05:19,500 --> 05:05:23,740
Just tell your parents very fellow teachers. I think they'll be most likely

3416
05:05:24,540 --> 05:05:31,420
Okay with it if I'm if I'm making a bit of money and then I'm like, okay, I'm going on a little business trip

3417
05:05:31,500 --> 05:05:33,500
They'll be like, yeah, okay, whatever. Bye

3418
05:05:39,900 --> 05:05:44,300
Something like that, I think it'll be really fun and then we can like go out and have girly

3419
05:05:44,940 --> 05:05:48,780
Uh girly like cafe hopping or something. I think that'll be great

3420
05:05:49,420 --> 05:05:51,420
I

3421
05:05:53,180 --> 05:05:57,340
Think it'll be great. I I would love I would love that. I would love to to meet them

3422
05:05:58,780 --> 05:06:04,540
Um, they're also very sweet and I love them very much and I I'm very protective of them like

3423
05:06:05,500 --> 05:06:07,500
I'm very protective of them

3424
05:06:08,940 --> 05:06:13,580
I'm very protective of the girls. So like I feel like you know, if someone

3425
05:06:14,060 --> 05:06:17,340
Hurts their feelings. I'm like that person. They're dead to me

3426
05:06:19,020 --> 05:06:21,020
Oh

3427
05:06:25,180 --> 05:06:26,700
Like oh

3428
05:06:26,700 --> 05:06:30,940
Yeah, and we've all we've all been in calls and stuff and hung out and you know

3429
05:06:32,380 --> 05:06:35,820
It's really nice. It's really nice. I love them. I love them very much

3430
05:06:35,820 --> 05:06:37,820
Uh

3431
05:06:48,380 --> 05:06:52,940
I'm I'm lucky to have my gen maze as my friends as my friends and my gen maze

3432
05:06:55,900 --> 05:07:01,260
I'm really happy because uh, sometimes we talk about things like oh like what do I do like

3433
05:07:02,140 --> 05:07:04,060
You know

3434
05:07:04,060 --> 05:07:06,060
personal things

3435
05:07:08,300 --> 05:07:12,780
We talk about like personal things together and goals and you know

3436
05:07:13,580 --> 05:07:15,580
Um, when we first came in I think

3437
05:07:16,700 --> 05:07:22,220
I think all of us kind of like started to just talk about and kind of gushed scrawny

3438
05:07:23,100 --> 05:07:25,340
About how thankful we were to be here

3439
05:07:25,740 --> 05:07:27,740
Ha ha ha

3440
05:07:30,620 --> 05:07:36,540
Like honestly we were like I'm so happy to be here. I'm so glad that you gave us a chance

3441
05:07:42,700 --> 05:07:45,580
Sometimes we we talk about uh

3442
05:07:46,780 --> 05:07:50,060
What do we talk about we just talk about anything to be honest like oh cool

3443
05:07:50,140 --> 05:07:55,100
Look at this cute lip lip gloss. Wow and everyone's like oh that lip gloss is so cute

3444
05:08:01,340 --> 05:08:06,140
That's kind of that kind of thing, you know, it's fairly normal stuff that we talk about

3445
05:08:08,860 --> 05:08:10,860
Yeah, like something demons

3446
05:08:13,740 --> 05:08:19,420
Sometimes we give each other advice about things like oh, you know, uh, it's my first time doing

3447
05:08:20,060 --> 05:08:26,460
This type of stream. How do I fix it or like oh my audio is being kind of funky? Uh, let's let's troubleshoot it together

3448
05:08:35,900 --> 05:08:37,900
Kind of things like that

3449
05:08:38,860 --> 05:08:42,940
Or if we're like sad about something and you know, we talk about it, you know

3450
05:08:44,380 --> 05:08:49,340
Oh, and of course the girls share their pet their pet uh faultles

3451
05:08:50,300 --> 05:08:52,300
and videos of their pets as well

3452
05:08:53,500 --> 05:08:59,020
It's fairly fairly. Uh, what's the word am I looking for inoculus?

3453
05:09:02,620 --> 05:09:04,620
This is inoculus

3454
05:09:08,060 --> 05:09:09,900
Yeah, it's pretty

3455
05:09:09,900 --> 05:09:11,900
Do I have pets? No

3456
05:09:11,900 --> 05:09:15,980
I don't have pets. Uh mama and papa don't like animals. So I don't have a pet

3457
05:09:16,300 --> 05:09:20,380
How cute are emmy's rats pretty cute

3458
05:09:27,900 --> 05:09:31,420
I love seeing like their pets and sometimes when we're in calls

3459
05:09:32,380 --> 05:09:34,540
Would you get a pet? Maybe

3460
05:09:35,580 --> 05:09:36,940
Um

3461
05:09:36,940 --> 05:09:43,660
Maybe I'm I'm not very familiar with pets since I've never really grown up with any so uh, so that's a maybe

3462
05:09:44,300 --> 05:09:45,260
um

3463
05:09:45,260 --> 05:09:51,340
Depending on financial situation. I might get a pet if I can provide with them the best that I can then I would get a pet

3464
05:09:55,180 --> 05:09:58,460
What pet would you get maybe a cat um or a dog?

3465
05:10:00,060 --> 05:10:02,060
Probably something basic

3466
05:10:02,540 --> 05:10:06,860
Maybe a dog. I'm I'm a little bit of allergic. I'm a little bit allergic to cats

3467
05:10:07,580 --> 05:10:13,340
I'm a little bit allergic to the I think long-haired cats. I sneeze a lot at my eyes, kid. Don't teary

3468
05:10:14,300 --> 05:10:16,300
We're not your pets. Of course you're my pets

3469
05:10:18,220 --> 05:10:23,180
But like if you wanted like a little fluffy fluffy little friend, you know

3470
05:10:29,020 --> 05:10:32,220
What happened to the dog that uses cage before us I bought it new

3471
05:10:32,620 --> 05:10:36,380
All right, I got it off of uh, Facebook marketplace

3472
05:10:46,620 --> 05:10:48,620
It depends how much cage it is

3473
05:10:49,900 --> 05:10:51,900
They're they're not cheap

3474
05:10:52,380 --> 05:10:53,900
I

3475
05:10:53,900 --> 05:10:55,900
Clean it first, of course I cleaned it

3476
05:11:13,660 --> 05:11:15,660
Yeah, I'm so thoughtful

3477
05:11:21,900 --> 05:11:25,420
Brand new cage never used before Facebook

3478
05:11:32,140 --> 05:11:34,140
Only the best for senpai

3479
05:11:37,020 --> 05:11:40,700
I should probably head to bed now though senpai

3480
05:11:52,620 --> 05:12:00,140
Uh the teabag slapped me. That's what I get for joshing around

3481
05:12:10,060 --> 05:12:18,140
So yeah, um, what was I gonna say? Uh, yeah tomorrow is my first time as a mar followed by that. Um

3482
05:12:18,300 --> 05:12:25,420
Uh, I'm gonna sound like a broken record, but some people are new here and I just want to remind everyone

3483
05:12:25,820 --> 05:12:30,380
But after that, it will be a difficult game about climbing. That is going to be a very loud game

3484
05:12:30,380 --> 05:12:34,540
So if you're expecting my soothing voice, you're gonna get a lot more screams instead

3485
05:12:35,740 --> 05:12:44,140
Uh designing jimmies outfits, uh, they're gonna be your kind of rough sketches. So my idea is like, you know, lovely date outfits

3486
05:12:44,540 --> 05:12:46,540
Lovely date outfits

3487
05:12:48,060 --> 05:12:49,900
And uh

3488
05:12:49,900 --> 05:12:53,420
After that is harvester and then deathmark and then the following

3489
05:12:54,140 --> 05:12:58,460
Week after will be a bit of a slowdown slowdown. So I will

3490
05:12:59,500 --> 05:13:01,980
Probably slow down to around three streams

3491
05:13:02,780 --> 05:13:04,780
and then slowly

3492
05:13:04,860 --> 05:13:08,460
slowly build up to five five, uh

3493
05:13:09,260 --> 05:13:11,260
five streams a week, uh, we're uh

3494
05:13:14,860 --> 05:13:18,060
This uh week is full because um

3495
05:13:20,620 --> 05:13:22,460
Because I

3496
05:13:22,460 --> 05:13:27,340
Want to definitely I want to show off off fastest fastest of me to senpai

3497
05:13:28,700 --> 05:13:30,700
And it's debut week. So I want to show off

3498
05:13:31,500 --> 05:13:35,020
fastest, uh, and I don't have anything else to do

3499
05:13:36,300 --> 05:13:40,860
That sounds bad, but I I just I just really want to spend time with everyone

3500
05:13:41,820 --> 05:13:46,300
I I don't have any prior engagements this week as well

3501
05:13:47,580 --> 05:13:52,700
I don't have any prior engagements. Uh next week though, I'll probably on my day off uh days off

3502
05:13:52,700 --> 05:13:55,260
I'll probably catch one chore that I was supposed to do

3503
05:14:02,060 --> 05:14:04,700
I'll probably uh, and then I'll probably uh

3504
05:14:04,700 --> 05:14:06,700
Uh

3505
05:14:07,020 --> 05:14:12,220
Yeah, I'll I'll do chores and do some work on my day on my days off

3506
05:14:12,780 --> 05:14:18,780
It sounds bad doing work on your days off, but it's like, you know things that I'll only take, uh,

3507
05:14:19,420 --> 05:14:21,420
maybe two hours or so

3508
05:14:22,380 --> 05:14:26,220
Like uh to prepare uh things for streams and uh

3509
05:14:27,100 --> 05:14:29,100
Hrion and stuff

3510
05:14:30,380 --> 05:14:32,380
Tell senpai to do his chores

3511
05:14:33,340 --> 05:14:35,340
Do your chores

3512
05:14:43,340 --> 05:14:45,340
If the cage is clean

3513
05:15:02,460 --> 05:15:06,380
Uh, uh keep the cages clean. Um

3514
05:15:07,660 --> 05:15:11,260
I think the biggest chore that I want for all my senpais is to take care of yourself

3515
05:15:11,900 --> 05:15:15,660
Be at your best. Go out meet your friends

3516
05:15:16,620 --> 05:15:19,100
Uh try a new hobby. That's my

3517
05:15:20,300 --> 05:15:23,100
