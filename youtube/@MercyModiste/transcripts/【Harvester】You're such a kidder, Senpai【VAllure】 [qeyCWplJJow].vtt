05:30.000 --> 05:50.000
and

05:50.000 --> 06:19.120
Hello everyone, hello Senpai, welcome to the stream.

06:20.120 --> 06:31.120
We're back at it again with Harvesturder.

06:31.120 --> 06:39.120
Sorry, I'm a slightly bit late, I'm slightly bit late, I had an idle meeting.

06:39.120 --> 06:51.120
Thank you for Griffin, for the 10 gifted, and welcome to member, member, and Iago.

06:51.120 --> 06:58.120
Welcome to member, lord, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Rock.

06:58.120 --> 07:04.120
Well, I can't read. How are you feeling? My arm is still itchy.

07:04.120 --> 07:12.120
So we're going to be playing kind of, not aggressively.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.120
Now we're going to play not that aggressively.

07:15.120 --> 07:20.120
Are you doing better? Let me check my arm.

07:20.120 --> 07:27.120
There's some patches that are cleared up, but there's some parts that are still pretty bumpy and gross.

07:27.120 --> 07:45.120
And it's, yeah, I have an appointment, I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday, that's the earliest she can see me, I think.

07:45.120 --> 07:57.120
And so we're going to check that out, but watch as like my rash goes away by Monday.

07:57.120 --> 08:10.120
It's LB really, it's always like that, right? It's always like that, it always, it always goes away by the time you get to the appointment.

08:10.120 --> 08:15.120
But yeah, it's been a couple of days now. This morning it was flaring up really badly.

08:15.120 --> 08:23.120
So I had to push, put my like bedsheets and stuff to the wash, so I have no blanket today.

08:23.120 --> 08:39.120
So I've turned on, I've turned on my streaming lights, because sometimes I don't turn them on, but today I'm turning them on, so it's extra warm in the cages and in the basement.

08:39.120 --> 09:02.120
So we're going to continue playing, playing, I don't remember if I have anything else to say, other than I want to just double check the instructions to see if I remember it.

09:02.120 --> 09:18.120
Oh, and I got in the new mouse, the new mouse that Senpai gifted, so now I have a mouse that actually works, and not a mouse that disconnects every moment.

09:18.120 --> 09:30.120
So now I can like move it nice. It fits my hand too.

09:30.120 --> 09:39.120
It fits my hand, so now I've got a nice mouse to play my point and click games.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.120
Okay, let's see, left button to move.

09:43.120 --> 09:56.120
I'm going to start on a puzzle, avoid cliches, crazy logical.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.120
Okay, I think we're good.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.120
Yeah, that was punch.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.120
Double click to open stuff.

10:05.120 --> 10:09.120
Okay, yeah, we're good, we're good, we're good Senpai.

10:09.120 --> 10:14.120
So now we just have to load our last save file.

10:14.120 --> 10:21.120
Which is Senpai, I love you, I think that's the one.

10:21.120 --> 10:26.120
Now you can play a difficult game about climbing.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.120
I think I was too frustrated with that.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.120
Okay, nothing else in here.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.120
Look at my stinking brother.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.120
Give me the paper.

10:39.120 --> 10:44.120
I don't want to talk to him, but he gives so much hints.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.120
He gives so much hints.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.120
And twitched and drew up.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.120
I guess I got my answer.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.120
This is why I hate you.

11:11.120 --> 11:16.120
Hate! Hate!

11:16.120 --> 11:17.120
Hate!

11:17.120 --> 11:18.120
Say what?

11:18.120 --> 11:21.120
Yeah, yeah, I said I hate you.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.120
Yeah, my little brother.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.120
Little brother, hate.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.120
Little sister.

11:29.120 --> 11:36.120
Okay, little brother, hate.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.120
Hate, Trid.

11:38.120 --> 11:44.120
I'm in Sparky's super foamy fire extinguisher.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.120
A new boy in his sleeping soundly.

11:47.120 --> 11:50.120
Hello, mother.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.120
Hello dear, how are you today?

11:52.120 --> 11:55.120
You know those firemen, the funny ones with the color sense.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.120
Looks like they misplaced a bolt of expensive fabric.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.120
Of course, each one of them suspects the other.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.120
Looks like a cat fight is brewing.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.120
Congratulations, hero.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.120
You found Karen after all.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.120
You don't seem proud, mother.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.120
You don't seem proud, yeah.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.120
I warned you not to waste time looking for her.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.120
Am I running out of time?

12:14.120 --> 12:16.120
The blood drive is coming soon.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.120
What does that have to do with anything?

12:18.120 --> 12:20.120
Yeah, why does that have to do with anything?

12:20.120 --> 12:23.120
Thank you, Vincent, for remembering.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.120
Still, I'm glad you found the poor baby.

12:26.120 --> 12:32.120
She says Mr. Potsdam was responsible for what happened to her.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.120
Yeah, I knew it.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.120
I can't believe Potsdam would do something.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.120
I believe her.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.120
Shame on you.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
Fuck you.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.120
Imagine accusing your future father-in-law of a thing like that.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.120
Is that how a rain-dryer would behave?

12:48.120 --> 12:50.120
I don't think so.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.120
Why would she lie?

12:52.120 --> 12:53.120
Why would she lie?

12:53.120 --> 12:56.120
Mr. Eisenheimer, even if he is a child,

12:56.120 --> 12:58.120
molester, a kidnapper, and an attempted murderer

12:58.120 --> 13:00.120
Molester, a kidnapper, and an attempted murderer?

13:00.120 --> 13:02.120
What kind of father-in-law he'll be?

13:02.120 --> 13:03.120
What?!

13:03.120 --> 13:05.120
I just can't wait for the wedding.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.120

13:08.120 --> 13:12.120
What do you mean that does not affect the way he's seen as a father-in-law?

13:19.120 --> 13:21.120
Also, Amy's not related.

13:23.120 --> 13:36.780

and buried her he couldn't bring himself to kill her out light so he just decided

33:06.960 --> 33:13.120
to stick her in the ground and let fate take its course who would do that to a

33:13.120 --> 33:18.800
helpless child she says it was mr potstown and I believe her

mysterious fire mysterious fire no nothing burned just you know they've all been quite uh

42:35.200 --> 42:42.000
amic amicable yeah yeah my all my jobs have been like kind of like amicable

42:43.120 --> 42:51.520
believing

42:51.520 --> 42:57.920
um

43:00.080 --> 43:03.680
without losing your job you wouldn't be able to lock us in cages

43:04.320 --> 43:07.200
yeah now I have better ways of locking senpai in cages

43:11.440 --> 43:13.920
let's see my last job was

43:14.480 --> 43:22.960
my last job was what do you call it real estate

43:25.600 --> 43:26.800
it was real estate

43:30.080 --> 43:36.320
yeah scouting out locations and all those empty houses

43:44.320 --> 43:48.720
did you find the mystical free real estate no I did not

43:51.760 --> 43:56.160
was it fun sort of it was fun I learned a lot

44:00.160 --> 44:03.600
I learned a lot but I definitely

44:06.720 --> 44:12.640
wouldn't do it again oh maybe I would or maybe I would you know if the opportunity arises I

44:12.640 --> 44:20.160
probably would do it again if like if for some reason if for some reason I cannot make a living

44:21.120 --> 44:28.240
here or I'm not working hard enough or something I'll probably take another additional job maybe in

44:28.240 --> 44:34.640
real estate again I learned how bad the housing market is yes I learned and I learned there are

44:34.640 --> 44:45.760
so many people who are ridiculously rich like there's some processes where when in real estate

44:45.760 --> 44:52.160
you know you're just kind of like they're like I want to play pay the whole the whole thing now

44:52.160 --> 45:01.600
I'm like technically we can't sell you this without you know without some more papers

45:06.400 --> 45:12.000
and then they go and then they go but I want to pay the whole thing right now in cash and I go

45:12.960 --> 45:16.160
that's nice we can't do that

45:16.160 --> 45:24.160
a full buyout yeah yeah yeah but they wanted to do in cash and that's not

45:25.520 --> 45:30.080
it's really a lot of the pay paperwork would be way more complex than it is

45:32.960 --> 45:36.880
and like the house that they wanted to buy was was a big house

45:37.520 --> 45:47.280
was a big house can I say it can I say the cost of the house

45:49.360 --> 45:51.520
anyways it's a big house it was uh

45:54.480 --> 45:56.960
let's say it was over one million

46:03.040 --> 46:04.160
it was a big house

46:07.760 --> 46:11.120
and they were like I want to pay in cash and I was like

46:15.040 --> 46:15.440
um

46:18.000 --> 46:21.200
I can't do that I can't do that

46:23.440 --> 46:24.960
do you get a cut of it no

46:29.840 --> 46:31.520
no because I didn't sell to them

46:32.160 --> 46:40.320
what exactly is wrong with paying in cash is because we need the paperwork and the paperwork

46:40.320 --> 46:45.920
usually requires like a lot more steps than just paying out full in full cash right because you

46:45.920 --> 46:54.000
have property and then you have the lawyer stuff and then you have bank notes and stuff and of

46:54.000 --> 46:58.720
course you need like a line of credit blah blah blah blah blah it's a lot to buy a house

47:01.680 --> 47:08.080
it's a lot to buy a house and it's like and title BS and then you have to like transfer transfer

47:08.080 --> 47:17.760
titles and stuff the implication of paying on cash is that you don't do paperwork but the thing is

47:17.760 --> 47:27.520
that like if I get paid in all cash it would be like you know people will start suspecting something

47:28.160 --> 47:33.280
and then it will go into a whole investigation and that's another whole load of like paperwork

47:35.760 --> 47:36.000
yeah

47:36.000 --> 47:46.160
oh sorry I missed the two super chats oh I need to feed me herself now

47:46.720 --> 47:52.960
I'll throw you a bone and can I stay out of the k can I stay in the cage for free now

47:53.600 --> 47:58.240
I thought who's been paying rent should I have been charging rent for these cages

48:06.720 --> 48:08.080
who's charging rent

48:20.400 --> 48:22.720
the landlord me no wrong it's me

48:26.560 --> 48:34.080
damn found out half of half of the uh half of the senpais are mysteriously gone next day

48:34.720 --> 48:36.240
watch

48:45.680 --> 48:51.680
okay I guess I guess if it's strongy if it's strongy then I guess that's okay

48:53.360 --> 48:54.320
I guess it's okay

48:57.200 --> 49:00.240
yeah strongy has been charging rent to fund VLR success

49:04.800 --> 49:13.360
but I'm pretty sure I didn't I didn't charge rent that's why I've been saying that I'm so nice to you

49:21.120 --> 49:27.200
no I've been paying I've been so nice to you I've been housing all my senpais in this cage

49:28.800 --> 49:29.600
then sometimes

49:34.080 --> 49:36.320
although if it is strongy then um I guess

49:43.120 --> 49:45.600
I guess that it is what it is

49:53.840 --> 49:58.320
but I saved up for a whole year to afford this one square foot cage

50:04.640 --> 50:10.880
but yeah um gosh well I've been yapping right anyways um

50:12.960 --> 50:21.120
it seems highly illegal and I don't want to like you know I don't want to be investigated for

50:21.120 --> 50:25.920
for I don't know assisting a crime or something you know what I'm saying

50:26.960 --> 50:32.960
senpai I don't want to I don't want to leave a trail I already know how to not leave a trail so

50:34.080 --> 50:38.960
um why would I why would I accept one million cash you know

50:44.080 --> 50:49.280
so yeah I was like okay well here's the steps you need to take before buying the house

50:54.240 --> 51:00.160
and you know that's what I did that's what I did I uh I gave them a list of what they needed to do

51:00.800 --> 51:04.400
before they they could buy the house and then they never bought the house

51:06.080 --> 51:09.360
and besides one more thing one more thing and uh one more thing

51:10.080 --> 51:15.920
we don't know if the cash is real or not it could be printed printed like you know fakes

51:15.920 --> 51:28.160
so

51:29.920 --> 51:34.400
yeah like you you never know right that's why you gotta be like okay well in cash

51:37.120 --> 51:41.840
that's kind of suspect uh so I want to go through the regular avenues for this house

51:46.000 --> 51:53.600
so I was like no no no no no no no now

51:59.200 --> 52:02.400
mercy do your best colombo impression that was my best colombo impression

52:04.880 --> 52:10.640
yeah I have to follow the rules the housing market is like there's a lot of rules for housing

52:10.640 --> 52:14.160
and stuff so if I don't follow all of them I get in trouble

52:20.560 --> 52:24.400
I get in trouble otherwise but then the rules

52:26.240 --> 52:29.120
then the rules you can't you can't you know

52:31.200 --> 52:37.200
you can't really just buy a house I don't know where it is a little bit of work maybe

52:37.520 --> 52:41.120
the fastest you can do is probably a day

52:43.680 --> 52:47.520
but you gotta have to yeah you have you have to um

52:49.520 --> 52:54.160
but then I'd have to work my ass off I have to work my ass off to get all the paperwork done

52:54.160 --> 53:00.160
to do like in a day so that's that's like um

53:00.960 --> 53:08.000
it is how it is anyways sorry me starting to think about the housing market and I'm like

53:08.000 --> 53:12.800
man I want my own place and then I look at the places that like it gets sold and I'm like oh

53:16.800 --> 53:20.880
I do want my own place though I do want my own place eventually so

53:20.880 --> 53:24.480
I'm willing I'll be happy to do my own paperwork for that

53:30.800 --> 53:34.320
oh sorry give me a second step by

53:37.680 --> 53:43.920
I'm gonna BRB I'm gonna need I'm gonna need to go get an ice pack again to put to ice my arm

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.200
I

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.200
had to take

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.200
an idle meeting

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.200

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.200
ice pack back in the freezer

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.200
since it was melting really fast too.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.200
Hahahaha

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.200
Did you hit, did you record it?

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.200
Wait what?

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.200
Why would I record that?

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.200
Hahahaha

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.200
Um

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.200

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.200

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.200
Hahahaha

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.200

We don't practice corporal punishment here.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.200
I've never believed in that old adage.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.200
Spare the rod and spoil the child.

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.200
A rod is too thin.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.200
But a baseball bat

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:03.200
That bridges the generation gap quite nicely.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.200
Okay

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.200
Okay, okay.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.200
Not again

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.200
Can I, can I skip it? There we go.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.200
Bye bye

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.200
Can I, can I grab the bat?

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.200
No

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.200
I feel like I'm supposed to do something before night time.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.200
I wonder how to do that.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.200
The door's locked.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.200
Is this it?

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.200
No

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.200
Oof.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.200
Didn't mean to do that.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.200
This has to be the closet, right?

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.200
Try the pulse badge?

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:05.200
I feel like I was supposed to use the blackmail him but I uh...

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.200
My button

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.200
Why I lost that months ago, where did you find it?

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.200
Funny thing that

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.200
I found it in the ashes

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.200
At the newspaper building

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.200
What are you implying?

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:23.200
That I had something to do with setting the fire?

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.200
Preposterous.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.200
Why a hundred people must have visited that site since the fire?

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:35.200
But none of them had buttons like this.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.200
You just try showing that button to Sheriff.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.200
Oh yeah?

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.200
Button

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.200
Wait, can I see that again? Okay

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.200
Bye

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.200
Do I still have the button?

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.200
Okay

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.200
Okay

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.200
Do I go to the officer then?

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.200
I don't know

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.200
Can I use the screwdriver?

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.200
Damn it

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.200
Damn it

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.200
Well that didn't work

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.200
Okay, that didn't work so

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.200
What else do we have?

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.200
A wrench

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.200
Okay, well that didn't work

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.200
Electrical tape for the wire

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.200
Damn it

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.200
Wait, where did it go? Did I put it back in myself?

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.200
Yeah, I did

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.200
Well that didn't work

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.200
Oh wait

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.200
Oh man

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.200
Well that didn't work

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.200
Maybe I can set off the alarm here

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.200
Well that didn't work

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.200
Oops, didn't mean that one

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.200
Okay

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.200
No

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.200
Maybe I should do this at night time

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.200
Maybe I should do this at night time

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.200
Night time, night time

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.200
Can I really not go on the fire station?

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.200
Maybe I can do it at night time

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.200
How do we skip time?

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.200
Yeah, I don't know how, I feel like I need to do something

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.200
Before

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.200
Is this the note?

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.200
Yeah

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.200
Yeah, this is the last guy

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.200
who came in

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.200
Okay

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.200
Okay

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:39.200
Well that didn't work

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.200
Can I take a picture of that?

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.200
Picture?

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.200
A camera, there it is

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.200
Okay

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.200
Well that didn't work

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.200
Oh man, well that didn't work

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.200
Ooh, lightning

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.200
Lightning

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.200
What if I go?

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.200
Just in case

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.200
Vampire

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.200
What if I go?

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.200
Where is the law?

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.200
I'll tell Ledger, there you go

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.200
Give me this

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.200
Can I steal stuff?

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.200
I want this

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.200
Come on

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.200
I want to get in here

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.200
Can I?

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.200
That is the broom closet, right?

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.200
It looks like that is the broom closet

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:33.200
so

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.200
I have to get there somehow

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.200
when he's not there

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.200
Mercy mutton

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.200
not have her tea tonight

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.200
because she's thirsty to get in that closet

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.200
I do have my tea

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.200
I do have my tea senpai

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.200
Okay, the hint is that

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.200
when you get to the fire station

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.200
I don't think we can go to the fire station

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.200
unless it's night time

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.200
Maybe I'll go back to the lodge again

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.200
and be like, what's up?

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.200
I've had enough of this, I'm no thief

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.200
Of course I am

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.200
Okay, what am I doing with the pole?

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.200
No?

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.200
Okay, so I have to steal that pole

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.200
What flavor is my tea?

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.200
Today's tea is, I wrote it down

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.200
I wrote it down senpai

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.200
Today's tea is

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.200
raspberry pomegranate

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.200
green tea

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:07.200
Doesn't that sound nice senpai?

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.200
Maybe I should make copies

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.200
I remember seeing like, oh you can make

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.200
three copies here, right?

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.200
Maybe I can copy all of the stuff

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.200
hotel ledger

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.200
Oh man, well that didn't work

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.200
No?

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.200
My sign meet permission?

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.200
Oh man

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.200
The note?

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.200
I got a copy of the note

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.200
What about this?

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.200
A copy of that?

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.200
I photocopied the badge?

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.200
Probably not

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.200
What about the burnt flyer?

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.200
Damn it, damn it

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.200
I'll copy of this guy?

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.200
Oh man

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.200
Maybe I can confront the officer now?

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.200
Oh no

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.200
But I want the building to

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.200
burn down

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.200
Oh, let's save

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.200
Or maybe not, save game

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.200
Senpai

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.200
Okay, I'm going to go in here

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.200
and see if there's anything else though

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:57.200
Vital clue in the

01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:59.200
mysterious jolly fat man

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.200
murder spree

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.200
dartboard

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.200
What is that?

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.200
No, I don't know what that is

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.200
beer can

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.200
binoculars, fuzzy bear, wielding

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.200
a chainsaw

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.200
exhaust

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.200
No

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.200
More unsolved cases

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.200
More unsolved cases

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.200
Get the diner probably

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.200
Wait, maybe I can go like

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.200
fire

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.200
Nevermind

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.200
Door is locked

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.200
Can I just break in

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:45.200
to this again?

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.200
Anything else?

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.200
No

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.200
Probably at the

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.200
Oh, if he's at the diner, maybe

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.200
Oh no, he's not moved yet

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.200
I

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:21.200
I keep on clicking the wrong

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:23.200
thing

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.200
I was going to say Senpai again because I'm

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.200
stupid, he's not here either, what the fuck is he?

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.200
I can't talk now

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.200
Bye

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:41.200
Bye

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.200
Wait, what was that?

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.200
Okay

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.200
Not here

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.200
Where'd he go?

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.200
The hell?

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.200
He's here, he's getting paid off

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.200
No

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.200
This is the worst part about point and clicks

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.200
Sometimes you know what to do, but you

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.200
don't know how to do them

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.200
Maybe I can blackmail

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.200
the post office man again

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.200
Maybe

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:37.200
Hi

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.200
Guess what I am

01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:59.200
Hmm

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.200
Hmm

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.200
What about the miso guy? The miso guy

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.200
will kill me, we already know that, he just

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:17.200
He'll kill me at any moment

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.200
Wait

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.200
What if I

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.200
What if I

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.200
Break

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.200
No

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.200
Okay, it's stuck to the thingy

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:35.200
It's here

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.200
Oh wait, there's

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.200
some lights here

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.200
Okay, I have to use

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.200
the light later

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.200
Looks like

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.200
Your tongue is pretty long, Koi

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.200
La la la la la

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.200
No more

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.200
to taste you with

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.200
right here

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.200
What does that tongue do?

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.200
It tastes, it has

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:39.200
a bunch of

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:41.200
areas that

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.200
Senpai

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:45.200
That has a

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.200
lot of taste buds in a bunch of places

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.200
and then you can taste

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:51.200
lots of food, yeah, thank you

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:53.200

Yeah, I checked the cafe already

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:49.200
Look, look, look, look

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.200
Eat them, eat them

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.200
Eat them

See, he's not here

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.200

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.200
See, he's not there

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.200

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.200
We can't get into the fire station

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:29.200
We can't get into the fire station

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.200
This is the part of point and click

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:35.200
cause I don't like where I'm just like

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.200
okay, we have to guess

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.200
and do dumb things now

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:43.200
He like, we can't get in

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:45.200
I think we can only get in

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:47.200
when it's like night out

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:53.200
Can you give your brother the autograph photo?

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.200
I tried last time

01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.200
and he's like, I don't care

01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.200
He's literally like, I don't care

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.200
Where is it?

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.200
Oh, there it is

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.200
See, he doesn't care

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:19.200
Can you still pull the fire?

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.200
That's what I tried to do

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:23.200
but I wasn't able to do it

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.200
Okay, well I guess I'll check

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.200

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.200

No, we start handing things

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.200
We start handing things over

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:13.200
Okay, well that's nice

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.200
Do you want anything about this button?

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.200
A triviality

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.200
Hotel ledger?

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.200

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.200
No tampons

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.200
Vitamins

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.200
Moon logic time, right?

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:01.200
Need a pen?

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.200
Need

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:09.200
A bake sale?

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:11.200
No

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:13.200
What about the

01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.200
checkbook?

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.200
Okay, what about um

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:25.200
No?

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:27.200
I feel like some of these are like useless

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.200
Okay, well bye

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.200
Bye now

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.200
Wait, there's like a

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.200
I wonder if I can use the manhole cover for this

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.200
Damn it

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.200
Damn it, okay, maybe not, jeez

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.200
There's nothing else to do at the lodge?

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.200
No

01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.200
He just talks about the cloth

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:05.200
And that's it

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.200
We must point and click further

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:11.200
Further

01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:15.200
What if I give you this?

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.200
What does that sheriff told you?

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.200
The sheriff said calm down

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.200
No

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.200
I

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:41.200
I didn't soft lock myself, right?

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.200
We didn't soft lock ourselves, right?

01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:53.200
The diner?

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.200
Oops

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:57.200
That's the TV station, my bad

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.200
Oh, that's another Tucker, you're right

01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:03.200
There, oh my gosh, he's right

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.200
There's like a ton of Tucker's

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.200
I always like those like blue stuff

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:23.200
I can't talk

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.200
Bye

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:39.200
Oh, I'm supposed to give the cloth

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.200

Drawer on the left, hold on

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.200
I was supposed to give the cloth to him

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.200
I thought he already

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:51.200
You know what, never mind

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.200
Locked door

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.200
What's this?

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.200
Oh

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.200
I didn't know

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:09.200
Alright, is the cloth still in your inventory?

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.200
No, I don't think so, I think he took it

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.200
I think he took it

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.200
Yeah, he took it

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.200
Strawny asked if I'll keep streaming

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:33.200
for another hour

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.200
Likely

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:37.200
I got a screwdriver, yeah

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:39.200
Thank you for the hand

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.200
Thank you for the hand senpai

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:43.200
That was hard to see

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.200
Oh

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.200
Okay, well, it's night time

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:57.200
It's night time, yay

01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:59.200
Finally, progress

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:03.200
We're gonna break into the fire station

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:15.200
Oh, shit

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.200
He's dead

01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.200
Do I have the cloth?

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:27.200
Can I fix it?

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:29.200
Can I fix this?

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.200
No

01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:33.200
I don't have the cloth anymore, I can't fix this

01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:37.200
I can't fix it

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.200
Let's

01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:41.200
Meat plant

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.200
Oh, yeah

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:45.200
Okay, time

01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:47.200
I did the boba shop

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.200
Barber shop is closed

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.200
Save

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.200
Yeah

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.200
Okay

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.200
We break in

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:13.200
with the wrench

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:15.200
No

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.200
I must have put that in

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.200
That's not how exactly a professional would break in

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.200
What do you mean?

01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:27.200
What do you mean that's not how a professional would break in?

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.200
Are you serious?

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.200
Are you serious?

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.200
Are you serious?

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.200
Damn

01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.200
Except for the occasional hairball coughs

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.200
Can I

01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:01.200
Unscrew this

01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.200
Yay, no

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.200
No, I got caught

01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.200
I got caught

01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.200
Oh, no

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:21.200
Okay, okay

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.200
Well, I'm gonna lull the game again

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:25.200
Good thing I saved

01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:27.200
We saved scum in this house

01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.200
Or in this basement

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:31.200
Not the law

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.200
Okay, first I put electric tape

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:35.200
On the door

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.200
And I break in

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:39.200
So that it doesn't arouse suspicion

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:45.200
Senpai

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:47.200
Senpai

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:51.200
Thank you for the five

01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.200
I give you affection

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:55.200
Can I come out of the cage for a little bit now?

01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:59.200
Maybe I have to turn

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:01.200
Okay

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.200
Oh

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:05.200
I got it

01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:07.200
I got it

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.200
Yeah

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:19.200
I did it

01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.200
I did it

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.200
School time now, hopefully

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:39.200
I want to go to the school

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:43.200
I'm breaking into the broom closet

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.200
Let me in

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:49.200
Let me in

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:57.200
Why do you sleep in jeans?

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.200
I want to pee, yeah, I want to pee

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.200
But also, why does this man sleep in jeans?

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.200
What do people want from me?

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.200
I want to pee

01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:21.200
I want to pee

01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.200
I don't think so

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:31.200
The most I sleep in

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:33.200
Is like

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:35.200
My t-shirts

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.200
I have a bunch of sleeping t-shirts

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:39.200
On colder days though

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:41.200
On really cold days

01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:43.200
I wear like, fleece jammies

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.200
What the hell is this?

01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.200
What the hell is this?

01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:03.200
What the hell is this?

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.200
Senpai

01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.200
What to say?

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:13.200
Please click the left button

01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.200
Wait what?

01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.200
Hold on

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:19.200
I need a full screen this

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:21.200
What does this say?

01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.200
What the fuck does this say?

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.200
Excuse me Senpai

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:31.200
Click

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:33.200
Second disc time

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:35.200
What do you mean second disc?

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:41.200
What does this say? Hold on

01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:43.200
Press control

01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:45.200
F4 and click left mouse button

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:49.200
Control

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:51.200
F4

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.200
Okay

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.200
Did it work?

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:07.200
Hello?

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.200
Hello?

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.200
Did I mess up Senpai?

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.200
I don't have a second disc

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:39.200
I bought this on Steam

01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:43.200
I bought on Steam

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:45.200
There's no second disc

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:51.200
Senpai save me

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.200
Save me

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:13.200
Whoa

01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.200
Wait it worked

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:19.200
We're saved Senpai

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:27.200
Yeah

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:29.200
I don't know how I did it

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.200
I just kept doing it

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.200
Like I was told

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.200
Save game

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.200
Save game

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:51.200
Save game

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.200
It worked eventually

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:55.200
We bought those

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:57.200
We um

01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:01.200
Wait is it still saying it at the bottom?

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:07.200
Wait the bottom still says

02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.200
Save game

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:21.200
It's okay we'll just leave it there

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:29.200
Now we'll just leave it there

02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:31.200
I'm not gonna risk anything

02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.200
Leave me alone

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.200
Bye

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:39.200
Good finally

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.200
Okay you know what never mind

02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:45.200
We might have to close it

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:47.200
Yeah we might have to close it

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.200
Look it's stuck now Senpai

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:51.200
It's stuck now

02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:53.200
Did I save? I saved

02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.200
Oh wait no no no

02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:59.200
I fixed it I hit exit again

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:01.200
We're good

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:09.200
Did you hear what happened at the barber shop?

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:11.200
Someone broke into Pastorelli's salon

02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.200
and took his antique barber's pole

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.200
The next morning Pastorelli

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:17.200
touched some live wires that the thief left lying around

02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:19.200
and was electrocuted

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:21.200
Well that darn foreigner got what he deserved

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:23.200
if you ask me

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.200
coming into a nice little town like harvest

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.200
and stealing business

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:29.200
Heavens if a bow and scissors

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:31.200
were good enough for your father

02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:33.200
I don't see why decent working folk

02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:35.200
need a fancy wop styling their hair

02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:37.200
That's how it goes

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:39.200
First you get a sissy trim then bang

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:41.200
You're a communist

02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:43.200
Isn't it exciting Steve?

02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.200
Five days and twelve hundred cookies later

02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:47.200
the bake sale is already here

02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:49.200
Where does the time fly?

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.200
Those one thousand

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:53.200
two hundred cookies

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:55.200
Senpai

02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:57.200
Oh about twenty

02:01:57.200 --> 02:01:59.200
the rest were stale

02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:01.200
but the effort wasn't wasted it's for a good cause

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:03.200
Will you be at the school tonight?

02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:07.200
Wouldn't miss it

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:09.200
That's nice dear

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:11.200
It's good to be open to new experiences

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:13.200
Oh my gosh

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.200
No wonder your hair is terrible ma'am

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.200
That was definitely

02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:25.200
a Facebook mom type of comment

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:27.200
Yeah

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:29.200
Oh my gosh

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:31.200
I would just like to tell

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.200
everyone I do not

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.200
believe and

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:37.200
reflect on this opinion

02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:41.200
Anyways thank you for the super chat

02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:43.200
A lot of these red

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:45.200
scissors are sharp this yandere

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:47.200
has kidnapped me and stolen my heart

02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:49.200
There it rhymes

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:51.200
Yep that one rhymes good job good pat

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:53.200
Good good job

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:55.200
Good job

02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:01.200
It's good to be

02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:03.200
open to new experiences

02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.200
at the conservative wife

02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:07.200
Yeah

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.200
And disclaimer this game

02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:11.200
was made a long time ago

02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:13.200
and it was

02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.200
a protest

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:17.200
against censorship

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:19.200
So therefore there is going to be some things

02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.200
that are very you know

02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:23.200
controversial

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:25.200
But

02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.200
please know that I do not reflect

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.200
the opinions in these games

02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:33.200
What's the good cause

02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:55.200
The air

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.200
shock their systems gets them

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.200
every time

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:07.200
What

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.200
Okay bye

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:29.200

02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:53.200
I don't have the paper

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.200
Wait no I do have the paper why didn't

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.200
I see it

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:05.200
I have the paper

02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:07.200
Wow I just didn't see it here you go

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:23.200

Okay let's get out of here

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:31.200
Okay first mission

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:33.200
You gotta bot stem's residence

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:41.200
Now I haven't seen him

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:43.200
Yeah yeah I get it

02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:55.200
I killed a person

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.200
I don't know

02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.200
Was there a way I could

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.200
have saved him some pie

02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:03.200
Hello dear

02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:05.200
Yes please

02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:07.200
The bake sale is tonight

02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:09.200
Seven o'clock at the school

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:11.200
Lots of cookies and yards of floss

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:13.200
Hope to see you there

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:15.200
Guards of floss okay bye

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.200
Give my regards to your parents

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:21.200
Only indirectly

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.200
Why did I do that

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:27.200
I'm so sad

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.200
He can't be saved

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:49.200
That's okay

02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:57.200
I don't know

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:01.200
I see my mother throwing out whole batches

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:03.200
of cookies like an automaton

02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:05.200
getting rid of its surplus product

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:07.200
My so called mother has been baking

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:09.200
cookies all week and then

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:11.200
throwing them out better that

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:13.200
than getting rid of us

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.200
Wait around long enough

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:17.200
I have a feeling they'll get to it

02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:21.200
I don't know if you heard or not

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:23.200
but Mr. Pastor Ali the barber

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:25.200
He's dead

02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:27.200
Looks like somebody stole

02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:29.200
a barber's pole from him

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.200
Then left the exposed electrical wires

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:33.200
and some water on the floor

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:35.200
Pastor Ali walked in flipped on the lights

02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:37.200
and

02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:39.200
No anything about that

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:41.200
No

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.200
Okay fine I didn't mean to kill him

02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:47.200
I just wanted the pole for the initiation

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.200
Fuck it, fuck it we did this

02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:51.200
That was our bed

02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:55.200
Like a man died

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:57.200
I didn't know

02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.200
I forgot about the live wires

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:01.200
and the water

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:03.200
That doesn't change the fact that you killed him

02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:05.200
This initiation killed him

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:07.200
It was just an accident

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.200
It was just like some time

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:13.200
where I

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:15.200
Don't you see

02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:17.200
I'm beginning to think that the lodge

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.200
poisons everything it touches

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.200
Harvest

02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:23.200
I didn't create this situation

02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:25.200
Are you sure

02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:27.200
No

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.200
But however it started

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.200
I'm gonna see it through to the end

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:33.200
Vandalism theft

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:35.200
Manslaughter

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.200
What's next Steve, murder

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.200
Second

02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:41.200
I know in the beginning I suggested you might check out the lodge

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.200
I was more worried about getting out of here

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:45.200
than anything else

02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:47.200
But now that I know you

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:49.200
I'm worried about you too

02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:51.200
I'm fine

02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:57.200
I'm not fine

02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:21.200
Come back and visit me soon

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:23.200
You can't just ask that after

02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:25.200
After doing that to me

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:27.200
You can't just ask that

02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:29.200
I know I understand

02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:31.200
Sometimes sometimes

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:33.200
You know

02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:35.200
Sometimes sometimes just force my hand sometimes

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.200
And then I just have to

02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:39.200
I just have to

02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:43.200
Yeah

02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:45.200
I know it happens to the best of us

02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:47.200
I didn't mean it though

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.200
I didn't mean it

02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:53.200
Sometimes Senpai just walks into my knife

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.200
And my scissors

02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:57.200
And my bat

02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:59.200
And my

02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:01.200
And the barrel

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:03.200
The bone saw was me though

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:05.200
But yeah

02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:07.200
You sometimes just walk into all of them

02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:15.200
And here it is

02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:17.200
The object dog

02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:19.200
The guard

02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:21.200
Imported Phoenician glass

02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:23.200
And Italian dreams

02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:25.200
Italian dreams

02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:27.200
An unfortunate side effect

02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:29.200
That pastorelli was

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.200
electrocuted because

02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:33.200
You left live wires

02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:35.200
In a puddle

02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:37.200
I didn't know there was a puddle

02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:39.200
The stations of worldliness say

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:41.200
Say love you

02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:49.200
Oh you can say it man it was electrocuted

02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:51.200
Pastorelli's own incompetence

02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:53.200
Caused his unfortunate

02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.200
Accent

02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:57.200
Maybe his incompetence

02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.200
I had

02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.200
You left live electrical wires

02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:03.200
Hanging in the water

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:05.200
On the floor

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.200
Cross wired the alarm system

02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:09.200
To the sprinklers

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.200
He'd be live today

02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:13.200
Of course

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:15.200
You only wanted the pole

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:17.200
But that hardly matters now

02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:19.200
But he turned on the light

02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:27.200
What?

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:31.200
What?

02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:33.200
What?

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.200
What do we have to do?

02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:37.200
No not the nice lady

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:39.200
And her daughter's diner

02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:43.200
Not the diner everybody eats

02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:45.200
There

02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:47.200
Not the French

02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:49.200
They're not French

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:51.200
Are they?

02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:55.200
They're not French are they?

02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:57.200
Oh no oh no

02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:59.200
Does that mean we have to fry

02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:01.200
That means French

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:03.200
French Canadian

02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:07.200
Oui oui

02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:09.200
Ah sacre ble

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.200
And

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:19.200
Ah sacre ble

02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:21.200
Ah

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:29.200
Ah whatever

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:31.200
That's no minor prank

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:33.200
So close

02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:35.200
And yet so far

02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.200
What a pity

02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:39.200
Tonight

02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:41.200
The big sale

02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:43.200
What do you mean docks

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:45.200
That was on her debut

02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:51.200
When sacrifice will be

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:53.200
The order of the day

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:55.200
What?

02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.200
What?

02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:03.200
Okay repeat this

02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.200
Okay pastor only took a big spill

02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.200
A permanent one

02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:21.200
Alright any suggestions?

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:41.200
So

02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:43.200
You know

02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:45.200
He just went

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.200
Okay I gotta move the window

02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:49.200
Up a little bit I can't get out of here

02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.200
Without it moved

02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:53.200
There it is

02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:59.200
Um

02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.200
I have to set fire

02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:09.200
To that nice ladies

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:11.200
Diner

02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:13.200
Bye bye

02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.200
I can't talk now

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:17.200
The dishes are stacked up in back

02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:19.200
And I better take advantage of the lull

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.200
I've whipped up a huge batch of brownies

02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:23.200
For the PTA bake sale tonight

02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.200
I just wish I could do more

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:27.200
To help out those poor bums

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:31.200
How will this sale help bums?

02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.200
Most of the bums that die in harvest

02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.200
Lack the money for a good Christian burial

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:37.200
The proceeds from this sale

02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:39.200
Will help Mr Moynihan provide them

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:41.200
With proper burial services

02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:43.200
Doesn't it strike you as funny

02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.200
That so many wanderers die in harvest?

02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:47.200
No

02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:49.200
Strikes me as sad

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:51.200
You have an odd sense of humor Steve

02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.200
Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted

02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.200
He's dead

02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.200
It looks like some thief wanted

02:14:57.200 --> 02:14:59.200
His barber's pole but didn't think of the consequences

02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:01.200
Yeah

02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:03.200
That's what the guy had to do

02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.200
Maybe whoever it was really needed

02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.200
That barber's pole bad

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:09.200
There's no excuse for hurting someone else

02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.200
Even if Pastorelli were alive

02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.200
Now his heart would be broken

02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:15.200
And what's a little profit compared to that?

02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:19.200
The most normal

02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:21.200
These are the

02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:23.200
These characters

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:25.200
Are the sense of

02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:27.200
Is the moral reasoning

02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.200
And I have to burn down

02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.200
Their

02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:33.200
Their precious home

02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.200
I mean like this was her

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:37.200
Her memento from her

02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:39.200
From the husband that went away

02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:49.200
Ugh

02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:51.200
I feel bad

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.200
But I'm not gonna stop

02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:57.200
I'm not gonna stop

02:15:57.200 --> 02:15:59.200
Ugh

02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:05.200
I feel bad

02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:07.200
I feel like really bad

02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:09.200
But I'm not gonna stop

02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:11.200
Ugh

02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:21.200
Okay

02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:23.200
Hello?

02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:25.200
Yes

02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:27.200
I did it

02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:35.200
Got him! Yeah!

02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:37.200
We did it!

02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:41.200
Woohoo!

02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:43.200
You're busted!

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:49.200
What will people think?

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.200
Yeah

02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:57.200
He's a smiley bear

02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:59.200
But we should give him a token of our

02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:01.200
Appreciation for his silence

02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:03.200
Here Stephen, take this baseball bat

02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:05.200
You'll find it quite useful

02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:09.200
Alright

02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:11.200
Maybe I could use a good solid bat

02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:13.200
Yeah boy

02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:15.200
Take the bat

02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:17.200
And we'll take the photo

02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:19.200
However will I keep the children in line now

02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:21.200
I have a spare I can bring in tomorrow

02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:23.200
Unless you prefer a chainsaw this time

02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:25.200
I'll talk to Mrs. Phelps

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:29.200
Can I do it again?

02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.200
Okay

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:35.200
Well that didn't work

02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:39.200
A chainsaw?

02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:41.200
Oh strongy!

02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.200
I feel so terrible

02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:47.200
That's okay

02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:49.200
Start using the bat

02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:51.200
On what?

02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:55.200
Okay

02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:19.200
Mama AP

02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:21.200
Okay mama can

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.200
Can sleep

02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:25.200
Welcome Raiders

02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:27.200
Welcome to the stream

02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:29.200
Welcome to the stream

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:31.200
Hello hello hello

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:33.200
I am one of mama's

02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:35.200
Five

02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:37.200
Daughters

02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:39.200
Daughters

02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:41.200
You don't say the t's when you're

02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:43.200
In squats

02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.200
And today

02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.200
I am committing crimes

02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:49.200
Not real crimes

02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:51.200
Game crimes

02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:53.200
We are currently playing

02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:55.200
Harvester

02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.200
It's a game from

02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.200
Senpai

02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:01.200
When was this game made?

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:03.200
Anyways

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:09.200
Anyways

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:11.200
It was a

02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:13.200
Oh

02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.200
It was a

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:19.200
Controversial game

02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:25.200
1998

02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:27.200
1996

02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:29.200
1996 yeah yeah yeah yeah

02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:31.200
It's a pretty old game

02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:39.200
My breasts huh

02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:43.200
Hope to see you at the back sale tonight

02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:45.200
When I went to get my hair trimmed this morning

02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:47.200
Imagine my surprise

02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:49.200
When I learned that the barbershop

02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:51.200
Had been burglarized

02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:53.200
And worse that Mr.

02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:55.200
Pastor really had been electrocuted

02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:57.200
Harvest mourns the loss

02:19:57.200 --> 02:19:59.200
Of an irreplaceable citizen

02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:01.200
All of us will feel the loss

02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:03.200
Only with the passage of time

02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:09.200
Drop in again soon

02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:11.200
If you weren't

02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:13.200
If you weren't

02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:15.200
If you weren't a diddler

02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:17.200

Thank you so much secret for a gifting

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:25.200
A memba

02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:27.200
If you weren't

02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:29.200
If you weren't a diddler

02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:31.200
That would have been some like

02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:33.200
Okay thing to say you know

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:35.200

02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:01.200
Well that kid's gone

02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:05.200
But

02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.200
We don't practice

02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:09.200
That bridge is the

02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:11.200
Oh dear

02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:13.200
Wait I thought she gave me her bat

02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:15.200
Now she has a bat again

02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:21.200
Okay bye

02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:23.200

So how do I use this

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:27.200
Do I just go

02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:29.200
Can I kill him

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.200
Can I kill him

02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:41.200
Bye

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:43.200
I didn't save

02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:49.200
I didn't save

02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:55.200
I didn't save

02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:57.200
I was the last time I saved

02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:01.200
In cold blood I can

02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:03.200
Well you know

02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:07.200
It's fine

02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:21.200
This is nip

02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:27.200
Too late for that boy

02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:29.200
Ain't it sergeant

02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:31.200
Indeed it is

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:33.200
Sheriff

02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.200
Answers may only be found

02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:37.200
In the lodge

02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:39.200
And you must be alive

02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:41.200
To see them

02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:43.200
Oh

02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:45.200
Oh okay

02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:57.200
Well that was my bad

02:22:57.200 --> 02:22:59.200
Let's not do that again

02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:01.200
My bad

02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:03.200
Load game

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:09.200
Well when did I

02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:13.200
When did I

02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:15.200
When did I save

02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:17.200
All the way back here we're fine

02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:19.200
I need my paper

02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:21.200
Okay

02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:23.200
Blah blah blah bye

02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:29.200
Mom

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.200
Yeah yeah yeah

02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:37.200
I have some things to do

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:41.200
What is the good cause

02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:49.200
Hey goodbye

02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:51.200
Don't forget to put

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:53.200
There we go we're kinda back

02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:55.200
It's not too bad it's just the start of the day

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:01.200
And then we go here

02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:03.200
And then we open our inventory

02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:05.200
And then we give

02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:07.200
See how easy it is

02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:09.200
Things are so much better between us

02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:11.200
When you remember the paper in the morning

02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:13.200
Let's keep them that way

02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.200
Have you tried flirting with mommy yet?

02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:17.200
Yep I did

02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:19.200
And then

02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:21.200
I was like so is anything gonna happen

02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:23.200
And then nothing happened so now I'm sad

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:25.200
That nothing happened but at the same time

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:27.200
A little relieved you know

02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:31.200
I can't believe that if I break into a place

02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:33.200
Then

02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:35.200
Then I get a kiss on the forehead

02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:37.200
And a tucked in good night

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:39.200
And like a death sentence for attacking someone

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.200
I can't believe it

02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:47.200
I'm just like okay

02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:55.200
Well

02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:57.200
Go back to the Potsdam's residence

02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.200
That was my bad

02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:01.200
Is this a visual novel? No

02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:03.200
It's a point

02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:05.200
Look at us we're pointing

02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:07.200
And we're clicking

02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:19.200
There it is

02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:23.200
Bye bye

02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:25.200
I hate this man's

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:27.200
Hello dear

02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:29.200
Yeah

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:31.200
She's upstairs

02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:33.200
The bake sale is to

02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:35.200

Yeah

02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:41.200
Yeah I pointed and clicked too hard

02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.200
Okay we're going in here

02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:47.200
Maybe Stephanie knows what to do with the tampons

02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:49.200
I remember it says maybe Stephanie knows what to do with the tampons

02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:51.200
Tampons

02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:53.200
Are you making some kind of point?

02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:55.200
No

02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:57.200
I'm fine

02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:09.200
Yep

02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:19.200
I didn't mean to kill him my bad

02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:27.200
I'm fine

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.200
Bye sorry

02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:35.200
I'm skipping through the text because we already got it

02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:47.200
Don't forget to save this time yes

02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:49.200
Gotta save

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:51.200
Save

02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:53.200
Where's the second disc

02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.200
Yeah we gotta get

02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:59.200
A bat

02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:01.200
Oh yeah and we gotta go to the lodge

02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.200
Hi

02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:05.200
Yeah you're imported glass

02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:07.200
Blah blah blah blah

02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:13.200
That's no minor

02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:15.200
Prank

02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.200
Okay

02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:21.200
I guess I have to do it

02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:23.200
The game will be over

02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:27.200
I think I went to

02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.200
Edna's diner

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.200
And she's like the voice of reason in this game

02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:43.200
Hi Mr. Bake Sale

02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:45.200
Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted

02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:47.200
He's dead

02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:49.200
It looks like some thief wanted his

02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:51.200
Barbers pole but didn't think of the consequences

02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:53.200
Could you hit the lodge guy with the bat?

02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:55.200
Maybe whoever it was really needed that

02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:57.200
Barbers pole bat

02:27:57.200 --> 02:27:59.200
That's no excuse for hurting someone else

02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:01.200
Even if Pastorelli were alive now

02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:03.200
His heart would be broken

02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:05.200
We'll consider that

02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:07.200
We'll consider that

02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:09.200
Hi

02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:11.200
We'll consider that

02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:15.200
Or the sheriff

02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:17.200
We'll consider those possibilities

02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:19.200
Soon

02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:21.200
Now

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.200
We can go spy on them

02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:25.200
Hihi

02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:27.200
Use the key

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:29.200
Oh man

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:31.200
Okay

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:33.200
We got it

02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:35.200
Can I save?

02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:37.200
Yeah

02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.200
We'll save here

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.200
And then

02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:43.200
Say cheese

02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:49.200
Yeah

02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:51.200
Blasted

02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:57.200
What will people think?

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.200
Yeah

02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:13.200
You'll find it quite useful

02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:17.200
Should we

02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:19.200
I wonder if it's like

02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:21.200
I think the photo is worth more than that

02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:23.200
Should we do that? Should we do like

02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:25.200
There's more than that

02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:27.200
Let's just see

02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:35.200
I'll take the fricking bat

02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:43.200
Whatever I'll take the bat

02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:45.200
See ya

02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:47.200
It's so true though

02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.200
It's so true they're educators

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:51.200
They got no money

02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:53.200
She's gonna bat you

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:55.200
I mean like

02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:57.200
Apparently she already did

02:29:57.200 --> 02:29:59.200
In her youth

02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:01.200
I mean in my youth

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.200
Can I get some more meat?

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:05.200
My meat permission slip

02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:13.200
Give me the meat

02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:15.200
Yeah extra meat baby

02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:21.200
Teachers don't get paid enough

02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:23.200
You survived getting the bat?

02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:25.200
Yeah

02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:33.200
I'm gonna visit the barber shop

02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:35.200
And cry a little

02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:43.200
Oh no

02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:47.200
That for the occasion I

02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:54.200
Think about taking some of that sighting off my hand son

02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:56.200
It's sad to see

02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:58.200
To see that you know it's just a chart

02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:13.200
The beef was well done too

02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:18.200
Problem is both was burnt so bad

02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:20.200
And the flesh all crisp

02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:22.200
And distorted limbs melded

02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:24.200
You couldn't tell them apart

02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:28.200
And well I didn't want to take a chance

02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:30.200
On eating Italian

02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:32.200
No sir I didn't

02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:34.200
You didn't want it? You were gonna eat him?

02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:36.200
Nice to see you again Steve

02:31:36.200 --> 02:31:38.200
You're gonna eat him?

02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:40.200
I can't talk now son

02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:43.200
I guess you heard

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:45.200
That dang edged pastorelli

02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:47.200
Went out and got his self-electric cheated

02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:50.200
Somebody stole the barber's pole

02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:52.200
The alarm system triggered the sprinkler

02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:55.200
There was water on the floor this morning

02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:58.200
And the derm crook left exposed wires out

02:31:58.200 --> 02:32:00.200
The pastorelli came in

02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:02.200
Flipped the switch and then

02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:04.200
ZAP

02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:07.200
Maybe them aliens is hot for colored glass after all

02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:11.200
Any time Steve

02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:13.200
Not gonna lie

02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:15.200
I'm a little sad

02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:17.200
I'm a little sad

02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:20.200
Pastorelli

02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:22.200
He didn't talk much

02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:24.200
But he was there

02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:28.200
Okay now I gotta figure out how to burn that damn building now

02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:30.200
Sorry son

02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:34.200
I hear you've been spreading all sorts of gossip about me around town

02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:35.200
Did I?

02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:37.200
That was a lot

02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:02.200
A hot town huh?

02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:04.200
Don't forget this

02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:07.200
I don't think I told anyone about you by the way

02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:12.200
That was some whiplash for sure

02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:16.200
Mood switch crazy

02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:19.200
Sometimes my mood switch gets like that too

02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:22.200
You still love me though right Senpai?

02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:28.200
Was this game developed by Swarri?

02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:30.200
I don't know

02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:35.200
Hello Steve

02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:38.200
Those PTA busybodies have hurt my business

02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.200
Something terrible this week

02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:42.200
Nobody's buying my cookies

02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:46.200
They're all saving up for the big bake sale

02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:49.200
Somebody stole the barber's pole from that nice Italian

02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:51.200
Italian

02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:53.200
Can you imagine?

02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:57.200
And then they left wife wires dangling in a puddle

02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:00.200
Which Pastorelli immediately stepped in and fried

02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:02.200
The stupid dago

02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:05.200
Heavens to Betsy when it rains it pours

02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:08.200
My bad

02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.200
Once again

02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:14.200
What can I say other than

02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:17.200
My bad

02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:33.200
Tee hee

02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:47.200
Hello

02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:50.200
I feel sad

02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:52.200
I feel like I'm responsible for my actions

02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:54.200
But I'm still gonna do it

02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:56.200
Give me a glue

02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:02.200
I'm afraid that's not good enough

02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:04.200
What do you want?

02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:06.200
You want some meat?

02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:12.200
What do I show on the hotel ledger?

02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:14.200
Why should I

02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:22.200
You want some meat?

02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:28.200
Why should I care about that?

02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:30.200
That's your favorite thing

02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:31.200
Meat

02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:33.200
Why doesn't he care about the meat?

02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:35.200
You want an autograph?

02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:40.200
I don't know man I want a blackmail this guy

02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:44.200
Oh blackmail this guy

02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:46.200
Oh my gosh

02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:48.200
Oh my god thank you for the

02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:50.200
For the memba

02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:52.200
I

02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:00.200
I don't know I feel like I'm gonna get arrested again

02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:02.200
I wanna I wanna dig

02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:04.200
I wanna dig

02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:06.200
I wanna dig for

02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:08.200
I wanna dig

02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:12.200
Come on can I take the headstone?

02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:16.200
What if I

02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:18.200
No not the note maybe if I use the

02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:22.200
Hotel ledger

02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:26.200
How do I blackmail this man?

02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:30.200
Can we give the meat to your father-in-law?

02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:32.200
Oh yeah I could do that

02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:34.200
Let's go see

02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:36.200
If I can get some meat

02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:42.200
That didn't work

02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:44.200
It's not as bad as some

02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:46.200
Point and clicks for example

02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:48.200
And um

02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:50.200
Sherlock Holmes

02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:52.200
Um

02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:54.200
No that can't be used for anything

02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:56.200
No that can't be used for any

02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:58.200
Can't be used for anything

02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:00.200
Or use the ballonin

02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:02.200
I have too many witnesses

02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:06.200
You want meat?

02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:08.200
Say that's

02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:10.200
That's a nice cut there Steve

02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:12.200
Did you bring it for me?

02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:18.200
Sure

02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:20.200
Sure you can have it

02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:28.200
I'm gonna go get some meat again

02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:34.200
This freak I know right

02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:36.200
Why he just cares about the meat so much

02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:38.200
Anyway I'm gonna go get some more meat

02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:42.200
You literally can just give it to him

02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:44.200
Okay that's interesting

02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:48.200
Okay

02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:52.200
Wait

02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:54.200

02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:56.200
Wait wait wait wait

02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:58.200
Where's my meat?

02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:00.200
Where's my meat permission slip?

02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:14.200
Man that was a two times

Okay hold on

02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:14.200

02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:20.200
No

02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:24.200
No not the meat

02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:26.200
We can't get any more meat

02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:28.200
That sucks

02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:30.200
Okay well

02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:32.200
I want the glue

02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:34.200
How do I blackmail this man's

02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:44.200
Our meat it's okay

02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:46.200
The door it's locked

02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:50.200
Young man we really

02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:52.200

02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:54.200
Sure

02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:56.200
Ditch makes a poor resting place

02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:58.200
You make it sound like I have

02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:00.200
A choice that is rapidly vanished

02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:04.200
Murder

02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:06.200
Murder

02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:08.200
I can't spell murder

02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:10.200
Murderer

02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:14.200

Okay bye

02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:24.200

02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:26.200
No more meat

02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:28.200
Murderer

02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:30.200
Fire station

02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:34.200
Are they still fighting

02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:38.200
Well it's quiet now

02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:42.200
Maybe they all killed each other

02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:44.200
Unfortunately

02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:50.200
Kettle

02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:00.200
Looks like we've got us a many

02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:02.200
Crime wave on our hands

02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:04.200
Just got a report about another

02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:06.200
Act of vandalism

02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:08.200
Maybe related to the tucker

02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:10.200
And the fire station robbery

02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:12.200
Someone broke into pastorelli's

02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:14.200
Barbershop and took his pole

02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:16.200
Next morning pastorelli touched

02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:18.200
Some live electrical wires that were

02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:20.200
Left dangling and zap

02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:22.200
No more barber

02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:24.200
What was just an act of vandalism

02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:26.200
Has just become a case of manslaughter

02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:28.200
Harvest used to be such a nice

02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:30.200
Little town

02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:32.200
Yeah

02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:34.200
Stop on by any time Steve

02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:36.200
Let me check

02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:38.200

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:40.200
Notes

02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:42.200

Here anymore

02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:58.200
Man

02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:00.200
That's not pertinent to any investigations

02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:10.200
Why does everyone think I'm talking about them

02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:12.200
I didn't do nothing

02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:14.200
A button

02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:18.200
I only showed the button to

02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:20.200
Oh wait

02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:22.200
I showed it to the lost woman

02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:24.200
Aw man she snitched on me

02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:30.200
Did she snitch on me

02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:38.200
Snitch on me

02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:42.200
Sorry Steve

I don't know

02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:56.200

02:42:58.200 --> 02:43:00.200

02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:04.200
I don't know

02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:06.200
I don't know

02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:08.200
It's just a tragedy

02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:10.200
Of course

02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:12.200
Pastorelli got electricuted

02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:14.200
But at least his pain is over

02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:16.200
Okay

02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:52.680
one this one oh can I look at it wait I can arm in his arm this wrench oh my

02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:57.440
gosh look I can't I can hold another weapon

02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:09.120

02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:19.000
weapon this whole time I didn't realize I did strange how there's a correlation

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:24.480
between the bums who've died and the bums you've put up at your hotel

02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.120
neither am I but I can tell you the odds against that

02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:39.040

02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:25.140
yes I could have photocopied it and then given it back and then he would have been like

02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:30.820

nominally engaging coincidence for personal gain yes what an immoral thing to do Stephen

02:52:55.140 --> 02:53:00.340
I'm not the one up to my ass in dead bodies yes but you have an un-reasoning faith in the

02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:07.460
consistency of the universe things can change young man I want you to live here or in the

02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:19.780
let me check out the photo where's the photo

02:57:31.380 --> 02:57:33.780

02:58:01.860 --> 02:58:03.780
so

02:58:12.260 --> 02:58:17.780

02:58:46.580 --> 02:58:55.060
in case we mess up

02:58:56.820 --> 02:58:57.780
look at this

02:58:58.900 --> 02:59:05.700
ah you've taken up photography I see now why on earth would you choose such a grotesque subject

02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:11.860
that John Doe you've got boxed up in the chapel he didn't just drop dead someone helped him take the

02:59:11.860 --> 02:59:19.460
plunge hmm you may be right I'm a mortician not a medical examiner you don't have to be to know

02:59:19.460 --> 02:59:24.340
that being ripped to shreds can be detrimental to your health this is not something you want to

02:59:24.340 --> 02:59:30.100
be looking into young man

02:59:33.380 --> 02:59:39.140
okay what should we say number one or number two some pie no shit I just want to find out who I

02:59:39.140 --> 02:59:43.540
am get the hell out of here or is that a threat I've got the goods on you not vice versa

02:59:48.340 --> 02:59:56.900
number one number one no shit that's what we all want what do you mean that's a game we win or

02:59:56.900 --> 03:00:01.220
lose together wait what are you gonna tell me what I want to know or do I go to the sheriff

03:00:01.220 --> 03:00:07.780
with these pictures that would be a grave mistake I assure you I've told you all I can

03:00:08.740 --> 03:00:12.260
my losses have been substantial of late so I can't offer you money

03:00:13.700 --> 03:00:20.660
the only thing I can give you an exchange for the photographs is my tube of astro glue I do

03:00:20.660 --> 03:00:31.780
suggest you take it for it's all you'll get from me here we go should we just take the glue now

03:00:32.020 --> 03:00:41.780
yeah we're just oh it's a trade or should I say not good enough I'm going to the sheriff

03:00:42.580 --> 03:00:43.460
I'll probably die

03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:54.980
fuck it I want to see be sure and tell actually I want the young man it seems like that corpse in

03:00:54.980 --> 03:01:01.940
the chapel I'll dress up and nowhere to go god knows by putting these people up at the wayward

03:01:01.940 --> 03:01:09.380
hotel I do orps the corpse reclining in the chapel right now is a prime example of the difficulties

03:01:09.380 --> 03:01:15.460
I've just like oh that's where the hint came from he died a purely natural car but why come to harvest

03:01:15.460 --> 03:01:22.260
to die I've often puzzled this was this was the hint oops though I can assure you young man that

03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:28.340
nothing untoward is happening in harvest on the contrary it's an indication of our compassion

03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:34.100
that I put up hobos in the wayward hotel and the order of the harvest moon mandates their prompt

03:01:34.100 --> 03:01:40.660
burial even when they are without family or means and when it entails losses on my part

03:01:41.780 --> 03:01:46.980
bye okay that was the hint say it's been a that was a hint he why didn't you tell me that before

03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:53.540
anyways give me this again ah you that john hmm you don't this is

03:01:55.540 --> 03:02:03.060
that's what we would get a look that would be I do suggest okay I'll take the glue wise decision

03:02:04.020 --> 03:02:11.380
when a wasp's nest is stirred up it is seldom the wasps who grieve later thanks for the glue get

03:02:11.380 --> 03:02:18.420
out of here I got a little things at our order but we got there we got the glue

03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:32.020
now what do I do with the glue I wanted it so badly I wanted it so badly but now I'm just like well

03:02:32.020 --> 03:02:39.060
what do I do with it wasp like the wasp lady yeah

03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:48.100
yeah

03:02:53.060 --> 03:02:59.300

03:03:45.380 --> 03:03:51.460
seeing you here again what my breast just swells with when I went to get my head and worse

03:03:51.620 --> 03:03:54.660
drop in again

03:04:00.260 --> 03:04:02.660
adult quality time

03:04:12.500 --> 03:04:15.940
see what we have our inventory we have the hotel ledger

03:04:16.580 --> 03:04:19.380
mortuary ledger astral glue

03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:25.620
damn it damn it damn it damn it

03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:34.740
what can we do about the burnt flyer if I show the burnt flyer to him

03:04:36.820 --> 03:04:40.100
that interests me not at all young man okay

03:04:46.420 --> 03:04:48.100
where do I go next

03:04:53.060 --> 03:04:53.860
maybe back home

03:05:02.740 --> 03:05:05.780
I don't want to sleep it's the baby hello

03:05:06.980 --> 03:05:09.140
okay don't forget to put the pin

03:05:10.820 --> 03:05:14.980
okay okay we gotta figure out how to burn that place down

03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:21.460
let's talk to the wasp lady yeah he did say about the wasp nest right

03:05:24.580 --> 03:05:25.780
what if I show her the glue

03:05:28.420 --> 03:05:29.300
it's not often

03:05:33.380 --> 03:05:36.500
you want you want some glue

03:05:38.180 --> 03:05:40.420
I have okay never mind

03:05:40.420 --> 03:05:44.820
um geez why do

03:05:48.820 --> 03:05:49.860
I get fire

03:05:53.860 --> 03:05:56.340
okay first off we need something as a fire starter

03:05:56.740 --> 03:06:13.140
oh wait the but maybe you could use the glue on the people

03:06:16.980 --> 03:06:21.540
that sounds logical and therefore it probably won't work but that does sound

03:06:21.540 --> 03:06:25.460
logical and maybe we'll be in for a surprise let's go see

03:06:30.980 --> 03:06:32.740
let's go see let's go see if we can do it

03:06:37.220 --> 03:06:40.820
where's my astral glue okay well that didn't work

03:06:43.140 --> 03:06:48.980
no did you have a gas can yeah I gave it back though

03:06:51.620 --> 03:06:59.940
I uh I gave it back though I gave it back so that the other man can start arson

03:07:00.660 --> 03:07:03.140
arson logic fails again

03:07:06.420 --> 03:07:07.620
can I grab this can

03:07:09.540 --> 03:07:13.780
give me it give me it oh I want it I want that can of gas

03:07:21.540 --> 03:07:31.460
okay we need something for the fire maybe maybe gonna ask the post office man

03:07:35.540 --> 03:07:39.860
you know a lot about fire right wait is that a present in the background uh you know a lot

03:07:39.860 --> 03:07:46.340
about fire right yeah my button funny thing that what are you implying

03:07:47.060 --> 03:07:54.180
got the crap and what if I did I guess I'd be pretty grateful to anyone who could help get me off

03:07:54.180 --> 03:08:02.500
the hook how you seem like a capable lad hypothetically let's say there was a gas can sitting

03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:08.340

03:37:23.540 --> 03:37:30.900
someone burnt down the tv channel there's nothing wrong nothing wrong honestly Hank

03:37:30.900 --> 03:37:34.980
you're acting like an alcoholic I told you all that tv would hurt you

03:37:35.700 --> 03:37:44.260
watching tv don't hurt me mom but not watching tv hurts bad if I find out who burnt down the tv

03:37:44.260 --> 03:37:48.100
station I'll make him wish he was one of those damn Indians

03:37:51.620 --> 03:37:54.660
uh I still want to hit my brother

03:37:58.100 --> 03:38:03.300
Hank come on right mom how did the bake sale go

03:38:04.980 --> 03:38:11.460
hello dear how are you today the nerve of some people burning down the tv station to detract from

03:38:11.460 --> 03:38:18.660
our bake sale I doubt the perpetrator did it just to annoy the harvest pta coincidence I don't think

03:38:18.660 --> 03:38:23.860
so just six months ago the newspaper building went up in smoke obviously there's a fire bug on the

03:38:24.340 --> 03:38:29.380
either that or a communist communist huh I'm so scared

03:38:32.500 --> 03:38:36.980
why are you so why are you scared now that the bake sales over I just don't know how I'll

03:38:36.980 --> 03:38:45.780
fill my time oh I feel so useless what's wrong with her

03:38:55.300 --> 03:39:00.820
oh it's not as bad as it looks you just pop them back in

03:39:07.700 --> 03:39:14.980
see as good as new that tarantula she ate must have had wasp eggs in it

03:39:14.980 --> 03:39:22.020
don't you think we should get her to a doctor what for she's got her mother how silly I was

03:39:22.020 --> 03:39:28.420
feeling useless just because there are no more cookies to bake I can still rear my brood this is

03:39:28.420 --> 03:39:36.580
a sign Steve I have a purpose again glad to see you're feeling better mine that fire still burns

03:39:36.660 --> 03:39:44.820
my bridges first the newspaper building then DNA's diner then WHAR I sense a pattern and any

03:39:44.820 --> 03:39:50.260
pattern I can't make a dress out of is no darn good I suppose you heard about DNA's diner burning

03:39:50.260 --> 03:39:56.420
down sheriff Dwayne thinks it was a grease fire we took a black eye on the bake sale but I'm sure

03:39:56.420 --> 03:40:02.580
the harvest pta annual blood drive will be more successful overall we made about 200 dollars

03:40:02.580 --> 03:40:08.020
hardly enough to bury a dead horse and definitely not enough to cover the annual blood drive

03:40:11.700 --> 03:40:12.500
the blood drive

03:40:15.060 --> 03:40:23.380
oh is my sister okay annual blood drive huh if you knew how much blood we get you'd be more impressed

03:40:24.420 --> 03:40:30.420
donations are mandatory Steve if you're still here come sunday you'll be expected to give

03:40:30.900 --> 03:40:38.100
until it hurts I suppose until it hurts even Hank will have to donate of course lodge members

03:40:38.100 --> 03:40:46.100
are exempt remember that hey either way no one's sticking me with the needle we don't use needles

03:40:46.100 --> 03:40:53.860

03:41:38.980 --> 03:41:40.420
okay no

03:41:47.940 --> 03:41:50.100

03:41:57.220 --> 03:42:03.060
did you say hello to your father for me yeah I did thank god harvest will never be the same

03:42:03.140 --> 03:42:07.860
without DNA's diner without DNA for that matter what

03:42:13.220 --> 03:42:19.700
I can't walk close to the kid why not go upstairs and talk to Stephanie she'd enjoy the company

03:42:19.700 --> 03:42:26.020
and while you're upstairs feel free to vlog sorry Steve I'm too upset to talk right now

03:42:26.980 --> 03:42:31.700
I can't believe anyone would burn down the tv station the night of the bake sale

03:42:32.420 --> 03:42:38.020
I just hope nothing will stop the harvest blood drive and I don't think that anything can

03:42:39.220 --> 03:42:46.340
I'm not one to gossip but I'm sure you've heard that DNA's diner burned down but did you know

03:42:46.340 --> 03:42:53.380
she killed herself when she found out what her and her daughter too what I hear the sheriff suspects

03:42:53.380 --> 03:43:00.180
the fire was set if you ask me whoever burned down the diner is a murderer just the same as

03:43:00.180 --> 03:43:03.220
if he'd blown Edna's brains out personally

03:43:12.500 --> 03:43:19.220

DNA's diner is no oh that hurts

03:53:31.300 --> 03:53:32.500
I've always been such a kid her

03:53:34.020 --> 03:53:39.220
as soon as she realized what had happened to her beloved establishment

03:53:40.260 --> 03:53:44.260
a true entrepreneur and a credit to our nation

03:53:44.980 --> 03:53:50.820
you bastards you made me a murderer

03:53:51.780 --> 03:53:59.620
her suicide was an unforeseen by-product predictable by no one she killed herself

03:54:00.500 --> 03:54:08.260
she made our choice if you were a catalyst join the rest of the world we all live

03:54:08.260 --> 03:54:15.940
of the deaths of others still you sought to torture diner and to which

03:54:27.220 --> 03:54:36.420
candidate I thought I was initiation this was only a trial to determine your worthiness for

03:54:36.500 --> 03:54:44.420
testing your initiation into the mysteries of the harvest will soon begin what in the meantime

03:54:45.300 --> 03:54:52.820
be patient protocols must be observed before initiation you think you got a

03:54:52.820 --> 03:54:58.980
sore throw from that I think probably took a lot to break you will know when you receive the

03:54:58.980 --> 03:55:04.180
invitation bring it here and your initiation shall begin

03:55:04.740 --> 03:55:08.500
what do you mean it took forever to get here

03:55:23.060 --> 03:55:25.140
what is this two different things

03:55:26.100 --> 03:55:28.980
still you sought to torture

03:55:30.980 --> 03:55:38.580
regardless having completed the trials an invitation shall be forthcoming

03:55:39.140 --> 03:55:46.100

03:57:40.260 --> 03:57:43.620
I've tried so hard to find an excuse to keep on fighting

03:57:44.580 --> 03:57:50.900
I care and I can't go on alone any longer this diner he loved us was all we had

03:57:51.860 --> 03:57:55.860
was always a struggle to keep it running in such a small town

03:57:57.380 --> 03:58:04.420
and now we've lost it I know that I can't afford to support this now there's only one way out

03:58:05.460 --> 03:58:12.340
I'm sure you won't be able to understand the depth of despair that would enable mother to

03:58:12.420 --> 03:58:18.900
put a rope around a baby's neck and push him into the air and jump after her

03:58:20.660 --> 03:58:27.700
and when your father makes me know if she kicks around and takes a long time to strangle

03:58:29.060 --> 03:58:36.100
else for you I won't cut her down I've got to be stronger than I ever was before

03:58:36.100 --> 03:58:39.860
but I hope she doesn't get it

03:58:41.940 --> 03:58:44.260
God help us and forgive us

03:58:55.220 --> 03:58:59.860
oh they're showing it huh

03:59:07.060 --> 03:59:11.860
is is that the sheriff

03:59:27.540 --> 03:59:29.860
who cooked his food

03:59:31.860 --> 03:59:33.860
I feel so bad

03:59:36.420 --> 03:59:43.540
now he has no place to eat

03:59:47.860 --> 03:59:57.860
I'm sorry I get a tan

04:00:06.580 --> 04:00:13.380
seeing you here again when it rains it pours isn't that so first Edna goes through all that with

04:00:13.380 --> 04:00:20.340
her daughter then she loses her diner if that happened to me I'd hang myself

04:00:23.140 --> 04:00:23.860
drop in again

04:00:24.660 --> 04:00:30.180
they're really they're really really pushing it oh it hurts it hurts

04:00:30.420 --> 04:00:36.660
thank you he's a total issue for the member

04:00:40.340 --> 04:00:45.140
they're like I was like okay don't feel bad don't feel bad we had we had to do

04:00:45.140 --> 04:00:48.020
one must be done and now they're making me feel bad

04:00:49.860 --> 04:00:54.740
like everyone else they're like oh they deserved it Edna though no she never deserved any of that

04:00:54.980 --> 04:00:58.580
why do you like that

04:01:03.460 --> 04:01:08.660
think about taking some of that siding off my hand son I'll cut you a nice price on it

04:01:09.220 --> 04:01:16.340
the tv station burning downs being good for business lots of folks are thinking of investing

04:01:16.660 --> 04:01:17.860
and I murdered her yeah

04:01:20.740 --> 04:01:26.660
nice to see you again Steve I can't talk now son I'm busy with this game

04:01:27.540 --> 04:01:34.180
ain't that a kick in the head first we lose the only barber in town in poop no more diner either

04:01:34.740 --> 04:01:40.340
why don't they beat all and now that the tv station's burning down maybe folks will get off

04:01:40.340 --> 04:01:49.540
their duff and get outdoors maybe take up alien hunting say clown will aluminum siding protect

04:01:49.540 --> 04:01:57.060
you from them alien censor jobbies nope you show up on their radar as a hunter surrounded by

04:01:57.060 --> 04:02:05.380
aluminum siding trust me leads to take just my luck anytime Steve

04:02:11.700 --> 04:02:15.300
oh at least they didn't twist the knife over and over again

04:02:18.100 --> 04:02:23.380
sorry son no time to talk neither rain nor sleep nor snow nor hell shall keep the mail from its

04:02:23.380 --> 04:02:29.620
appointed rounds hello there young man what's the good word someone burned WHAR down last night

04:02:30.260 --> 04:02:37.940
really I hadn't heard anything about it and since I don't have a tv I didn't notice it was off really

04:02:40.820 --> 04:02:43.220
fire don't mumble

04:02:43.220 --> 04:02:50.100
son WHAR don't mumble son hey bye next time you put

04:02:52.500 --> 04:02:53.860
oh at least he's happy about it

04:02:56.180 --> 04:02:58.500
didn't say anything about Edna though

04:03:01.300 --> 04:03:02.500
about the general store

04:03:02.500 --> 04:03:16.420
hello Steve I don't mind telling you when I heard what happened to the diner I went out and got me

04:03:16.420 --> 04:03:22.900
extra insurance right away I have no desire to wind up dangling from my rafters like Edna

04:03:22.900 --> 04:03:29.940
believe you me Steve did you see the fire as I was watching the tv station go up

04:03:30.660 --> 04:03:37.620
I was reminded of the old Sentinel building when you think about it you know two communication

04:03:37.620 --> 04:03:42.340
complexes going up in smoke you have to wonder if it was a coincidence

04:03:46.580 --> 04:03:49.540
hello Steve well I bought everything from her

04:03:52.020 --> 04:03:54.180
yeah well she bought extra insurance

04:03:54.900 --> 04:04:02.500
I guess we can check what happens with

04:04:05.220 --> 04:04:12.100
oh can I not oh wait I can't visit her anything you got to say it's not okay bye

04:04:13.620 --> 04:04:21.220
well I guess the wasp lady's okay she's fine well let's see what this guy says oh we hate this guy

04:04:22.100 --> 04:04:29.940
sorry Steve too tired to talk right now I just gave the Tucker a tune up I'll talk to you later

04:04:30.820 --> 04:04:39.540
DNA's diner burned down what a shame women running things that's the problem if she'd

04:04:39.540 --> 04:04:48.820
had a man around that fire never would have happened what a waste damn terrible thing that business

04:04:48.820 --> 04:04:55.380
with the tv station I can't sleep now we hate some waking up in a cold sweat

04:04:56.820 --> 04:05:02.980
I'm thinking of getting some fireproof aluminum siding for my garage we hate some that's a good

04:05:02.980 --> 04:05:03.940
I hate some

04:05:07.540 --> 04:05:13.140
uh we'll probably get killed if we spread smash his car but goodness that I smash it

04:05:14.100 --> 04:05:21.140
hmm I don't like that I don't like it no Sherry that woman was the voice of reason

04:05:28.660 --> 04:05:30.100
that one was the voice of reason

04:05:35.940 --> 04:05:39.380
nah and now it's a real one young man we real

04:05:40.180 --> 04:05:44.820
the WHAR fire is just another example of the vagaries of my profession

04:05:46.340 --> 04:05:53.940
odd after such a catastrophic conflagration not to have any fatalities disappointing in a way

04:05:54.900 --> 04:05:58.020
I might have gotten some paying customers for a change

04:05:58.900 --> 04:06:01.300
okay so nobody died

04:06:15.620 --> 04:06:17.860
nobody died surprising

04:06:22.980 --> 04:06:24.180

Stephen I'm glad that discipline ah Stephen you're just in time I was about to administer a

04:07:34.260 --> 04:07:40.020
lesson in good citizenship to these youngsters I'm sure one of these precious darlings burnt

04:07:40.020 --> 04:07:47.380
down the television station and they if the little shits could talk I'm sure I'd find out who but as it is

04:07:52.980 --> 04:07:58.340
I guess everyone will have to take my special civics course again

04:08:01.060 --> 04:08:05.540

04:09:26.340 --> 04:09:27.540

04:09:28.340 --> 04:09:30.900

04:13:52.420 --> 04:13:58.260

god is that what I think it is yep it's a spinal cord is it Stephanie

04:14:23.220 --> 04:14:33.060
I can see a resemblance but I can't be sure more pie sheriff pie don't you realize what's happened

04:14:35.940 --> 04:14:41.860
oh indeed I do I can just hear the tongue waging at the pta

04:14:42.580 --> 04:14:46.260
was it suicide

04:14:48.020 --> 04:14:54.260
never heard of anyone pulling their own spinal cord out before off the record I'd have to say nope

04:14:55.460 --> 04:15:03.460
no all in all I'd say this was dead by natural causes natural causes natural causes

04:15:05.620 --> 04:15:10.500
you can't live without a spinal cord son nothing unnatural about that

04:15:12.180 --> 04:15:13.700
think I will have some more pie

04:15:17.620 --> 04:15:28.980
right away I can't believe this well I guess he has a point believe me you get to the point

04:15:28.980 --> 04:15:31.300
to where this is routine

04:15:31.940 --> 04:15:41.620
now the only clue we got is that card on her pillow take a look at it

04:15:45.300 --> 04:15:49.700
I can't fucking read that be it known that the sacred order of the

04:15:49.700 --> 04:15:56.340
practically confession confession to watch son murder isn't that what you're here to investigate

04:15:56.660 --> 04:16:04.740
son you don't investigate natural deaths no point then I'll get to the bottom of this myself

04:16:06.180 --> 04:16:09.300
yeah I'm sure you will

04:16:12.580 --> 04:16:13.860
more pie sheriff

04:16:17.060 --> 04:16:18.500
don't mind if I do

04:16:18.660 --> 04:16:28.260
all right let's take a look at that card again

04:16:31.620 --> 04:16:33.540
I guess we got the lodge invitation

04:16:36.100 --> 04:16:38.020
hello Steve have some pie

04:16:41.220 --> 04:16:42.820
there's skeleton in the family closet

04:16:44.180 --> 04:16:47.300
we're going to put her in the crypt keeping bodies in the house

04:16:47.300 --> 04:16:54.020
it's just not sanitary I see I don't suppose it'd hurt for you to take the card

04:16:54.740 --> 04:16:56.420
seeing as it was addressed to you

04:16:57.540 --> 04:16:58.580
the shucks

04:16:58.580 --> 04:17:00.420
senpai senpai

04:17:01.700 --> 04:17:05.940
but that's my job so I wonder if there's more pie

04:17:08.980 --> 04:17:12.340
thank you boy for the 420 tip

04:17:13.060 --> 04:17:15.620

04:17:17.060 --> 04:17:18.500
oh it happens you know

04:17:21.940 --> 04:17:28.180
it just happens when and senpai's being a little oh shh low guy

04:17:29.700 --> 04:17:32.500
we got the invitation in the end at what cost

04:17:33.380 --> 04:17:36.740
I'm so hungry Steve so hungry

04:17:37.140 --> 04:17:43.620
if I'd been an astronaut I could afford all the meat I want the red kind

04:17:44.820 --> 04:17:47.620
and the young pink kind too

04:17:48.340 --> 04:17:49.140
pink kind

04:17:51.780 --> 04:17:58.180
okay they said family crypt right well I guess we're going there again

04:18:01.060 --> 04:18:01.700
here we go

04:18:01.700 --> 04:18:03.700
oh

04:18:07.140 --> 04:18:10.740
I'm only full of cannibals yeah here we go again

04:18:12.580 --> 04:18:17.860
oh right in time my rash is starting to act up damn it there we go

04:18:23.540 --> 04:18:26.020

well it's slightly I might have to go get the ice pack again what does the note say

04:18:48.900 --> 04:18:50.500
hold on

04:18:53.220 --> 04:18:55.140
I'll go back to my house to look at the note

04:19:01.220 --> 04:19:09.220

04:19:50.180 --> 04:19:56.340
what do you mean brought what I don't understand the invitation was not the card

04:19:57.060 --> 04:20:03.140
but the spinal cord it must be presented to me I have to get the spinal cord

04:20:03.220 --> 04:20:04.500
you to enter

04:20:09.700 --> 04:20:13.060
you expect me to steal their mains and bring them here you stick bastard

04:20:19.380 --> 04:20:20.900
he wants the freaking spine

04:20:21.540 --> 04:20:30.180
you were provided an invitation bring me the skull and spinal cord if you would pass to the

04:20:30.180 --> 04:20:41.540
world beyond okay I don't understand what's the other one I you were provided and okay okay

04:20:41.540 --> 04:20:42.980
well I go back now I guess

04:20:45.780 --> 04:20:46.740
looks like I go back

04:20:54.580 --> 04:20:58.340
if this is this a metaphor to grow a spine probably

04:21:00.420 --> 04:21:02.820
well I already grave robbed so we're fine

04:21:03.380 --> 04:21:07.460
here we go

04:21:09.860 --> 04:21:16.340
back at it again we already did this I did this way earlier that's so funny

04:21:17.700 --> 04:21:20.740
that's so funny that I already did this I did things out of order

04:21:20.900 --> 04:21:28.900
okay get over here

04:21:32.180 --> 04:21:35.780
it says reference to sub zero's fatality oh yeah that makes sense

04:21:37.300 --> 04:21:39.060
here you go you stinking bitch

04:21:39.620 --> 04:21:48.260
ah you have done well now let the initiation commence as your mystic

04:21:48.980 --> 04:21:49.620
mystic ag

04:21:49.620 --> 04:22:00.420
requested and required that I turn over this sacred dagger to you to aid you in your quest

04:22:02.740 --> 04:22:07.380
what is this what the heck you just gave me the logo

04:22:07.460 --> 04:22:15.940
you must now enter the lodge initiates find it our style place are you supposed to help me

04:22:15.940 --> 04:22:25.860
or get me killed I'm starting you on the path of initiation to a very special very exclusive

04:22:25.860 --> 04:22:35.300
brotherhood I am merely the administrator of a test whether you view me as an enemy

04:22:35.300 --> 04:22:44.420
or a friend depends on how well you're prepared to pass this thing you haven't said what it is

04:22:45.060 --> 04:22:51.380
it is a special weapon using it will be part of the initiation

04:22:51.380 --> 04:23:00.260
the hell with your initiation

04:23:03.540 --> 04:23:14.020
okay whatever occurs in here is relevant to the great question which you cannot help but answer

04:23:14.740 --> 04:23:23.860
what is at issue is whether in answering the question you will find the answers you seek

04:23:24.660 --> 04:23:31.460
you will encounter those intent on preventing or prompting your answer depending on how you

04:23:31.460 --> 04:23:42.900
look at it while the assumption is you want to live dying is easy and provides its own answer

04:23:42.900 --> 04:23:50.580
but not for you just tell me is Stephanie dead or being held within the membership director

04:23:50.580 --> 04:23:58.100
on the second level keeps track of such wow you just talked a lot then you are against me

04:23:58.900 --> 04:24:07.060
I am the sergeant at arms I am here to ensure that the protocols are observed

04:24:07.700 --> 04:24:15.060
deviation from a protocol shall result in punishment remember what I have told you

04:24:15.780 --> 04:24:24.100
now let the initiation begin yeah making him deliver that much exposition with that with

04:24:24.100 --> 04:24:33.620
that voice is a lot not again the third disc

04:24:37.780 --> 04:24:48.260
it worked the first time give me a second save and give me another second some pie I'm gonna have to

04:24:55.060 --> 04:25:02.820

04:25:07.300 --> 04:25:12.020

04:25:16.420 --> 04:25:21.940
okay I'll BRB some pie

04:27:46.820 --> 04:28:11.140
okay okay some pie I have the ice pack on me so my my hands my arm movement is very limited

04:28:11.140 --> 04:28:18.820
so we're gonna try anyways let's see how this goes

04:28:30.020 --> 04:28:36.580
hopefully it calms down for the night I normally I would I think I would take some

04:28:36.580 --> 04:28:46.180
Benadryl but I don't want to get sleepy because I want to see if uh if if I can finish this

04:28:48.740 --> 04:28:57.060
oh you're here excellent you'll find them through that door excuse me you are the exterminator

04:28:57.060 --> 04:29:03.380
are you not no in that case I'm afraid you'll have a hard time of it sir

04:29:04.340 --> 04:29:12.100
recently the lodge has become infested by pests they need exterminating or

04:29:12.660 --> 04:29:17.700
you were a part of the lodge this whole time they need killing and plenty

04:29:22.100 --> 04:29:27.380
that's the quickest way to the second level the second floor sir the entrance is hidden

04:29:27.380 --> 04:29:34.740
but a little reflection should reveal the answer to find the key to the second floor

04:29:34.740 --> 04:29:43.300
reach deep within yourself I wish you good luck sir I only hope you can stomach what's ahead

04:29:45.060 --> 04:29:45.460

04:31:30.740 --> 04:31:35.220
a nauseous pool of acid covered by a nutrient film

that was my accident

04:34:12.740 --> 04:34:17.220
upon leaving the strange rooms behind you notice a burning feeling in your skin

04:34:17.220 --> 04:34:20.100
you also notice a gooey film of slime covers your clothes

04:34:23.220 --> 04:34:27.300
a totem mystic figurine mysterious and impressive clearly made

04:34:27.940 --> 04:34:30.180

05:01:11.780 --> 05:01:13.780

05:01:43.780 --> 05:01:56.180

05:02:10.420 --> 05:02:18.020

05:02:18.980 --> 05:02:26.020
in a part in a part of a game you would you know call in

05:02:29.140 --> 05:02:32.180
okay we're gonna save here you would call in

05:02:35.220 --> 05:02:38.340
you would call in or you would buy a hint book

05:02:39.300 --> 05:02:45.060
and in order to help you and a lot of games purposely made it really obtuse

05:02:53.700 --> 05:03:00.340
was was really obtuse to uh to get was there something in the the hint room

05:03:01.300 --> 05:03:04.260

05:03:11.460 --> 05:03:16.660

05:03:23.620 --> 05:03:24.660
sorry I don't see anything

05:03:30.500 --> 05:03:34.500
I switch in the cloak room oh this

05:03:34.580 --> 05:03:34.660
this

05:03:51.300 --> 05:03:54.660
oh

05:04:04.500 --> 05:04:11.500
It crashed!

05:04:34.500 --> 05:04:44.500
Is it not going to appear again?

05:04:44.500 --> 05:04:54.500
Is it not going to appear again?

05:05:04.500 --> 05:05:12.500
Oh no, it's not capturing!

05:05:12.500 --> 05:05:23.500
Senpai is not capturing right now!

05:05:23.500 --> 05:05:28.500
I think I'll take this as a sign, Senpai.

05:05:28.500 --> 05:05:37.500
I'll take this as a sign to stop right now.

05:05:37.500 --> 05:05:46.500
I think this is the sign.

05:05:46.500 --> 05:05:54.500
It's going to just catten.

05:05:54.500 --> 05:06:02.500
Wow, Senpai! It looks like we're going to have to return to this game another day.

05:06:02.500 --> 05:06:14.500
I'm pretty sure we're very close to the end, so it'll probably be the game and then probably another game if I finish earlier.

05:06:14.500 --> 05:06:22.500
But oh man, did it crash!

05:06:22.500 --> 05:06:27.500
It's okay, I'm so happy to have all my Senpais here with me.

05:06:27.500 --> 05:06:32.500
So let's check my schedule.

05:06:32.500 --> 05:06:40.500
Okie dokie.

05:06:40.500 --> 05:06:46.500
Tomorrow is my day off.

05:06:46.500 --> 05:06:52.500
Tomorrow is my day off and then I will have my karaoke on Sunday.

05:06:52.500 --> 05:06:58.500
And then I'll post my upcoming schedule around Sunday, probably.

05:06:58.500 --> 05:07:01.500
Yes, most likely.

05:07:01.500 --> 05:07:07.500
So I hope, oh man, I feel bad that we haven't finished the game, but hey, it crashed!

05:07:07.500 --> 05:07:10.500
What else are we going to do?

05:07:10.500 --> 05:07:14.500
Thank you for the 420 almighty hair on!

05:07:15.500 --> 05:07:24.500
When a lovely Senpai you are.

05:07:24.500 --> 05:07:42.500
I'm excited for karaoke, but I'm also a little nervous, so I hope Senpai doesn't mind if I'm not the greatest singer, but I'm trying!

05:07:42.500 --> 05:07:45.500
And that's the idol way, right?

05:07:45.500 --> 05:07:52.500
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your, your arrow idol.

05:07:52.500 --> 05:07:56.500
In training! Well, maybe I am already an idol.

05:07:56.500 --> 05:08:05.500
Oh well.

05:08:06.500 --> 05:08:09.500
It's the hardest I count, so I'm going to try my best.

05:08:09.500 --> 05:08:12.500
I'll try my best for Senpai.

05:08:12.500 --> 05:08:19.500
What exactly is an arrow idol?

05:08:19.500 --> 05:08:30.500
Well, if you take away the A, what does it say?

05:08:35.500 --> 05:08:48.500
Senpai, figure it out!

05:08:48.500 --> 05:08:51.500
Good job Senpai, I'm proud of you!

05:08:51.500 --> 05:08:55.500
Remember, use your brains, and your eyes.

05:08:55.500 --> 05:09:01.500
Your eyes and your brain.

05:09:01.500 --> 05:09:03.500
It's okay Senpai.

05:09:03.500 --> 05:09:07.500
We got, we have to, we have to be a little sneaky here.

05:09:07.500 --> 05:09:12.500
We have to be a little sneaky here.

05:09:12.500 --> 05:09:16.500
It's okay, I forgive you.

05:09:16.500 --> 05:09:19.500
That's asking a lot, Kohai. No it's not!

05:09:19.500 --> 05:09:25.500
Heck, I'll even, I'll even put in some books into the cages so you'll read.

05:09:25.500 --> 05:09:32.500
Like a Moby Dick, or a Skylight Letter, or a Picture of Dorian Gray.

05:09:32.500 --> 05:09:37.500
You can have a lot of books to read and then your mind will open.

05:09:37.500 --> 05:09:47.500
Or I'll open your mind myself using an axe.

05:09:47.500 --> 05:09:52.500
Can we get some Hamlets? Sure.

05:09:52.500 --> 05:09:55.500
How about the Mysterious Island?

05:09:55.500 --> 05:10:00.500
I've got, what book do I have?

05:10:00.500 --> 05:10:05.500
Hold on, Senpai, I have a book about an island just for you.

05:10:05.500 --> 05:10:09.500
The Island of Dr. Moro. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:10:09.500 --> 05:10:13.500
The Island of Dr. Moro. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:10:13.500 --> 05:10:31.500
Yeah, where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? It's too easy.

05:10:31.500 --> 05:10:34.500
Can we read Cardcaptor Sakura instead?

05:10:34.500 --> 05:10:37.500
Did you even watch Cardcaptor Sakura?

05:10:37.500 --> 05:10:42.500
Speaking of, speaking of Senpai.

05:10:42.500 --> 05:10:56.500
Did you do your homework yet?

05:10:56.500 --> 05:11:01.500
We still have time. Of course you have time.

05:11:01.500 --> 05:11:07.500
I just wanted to make sure earlier you start the Moro free time you have.

05:11:07.500 --> 05:11:10.500
This class has homework?

05:11:10.500 --> 05:11:15.500
Yep. I can explain. Yeah, about that.

05:11:15.500 --> 05:11:20.500
Well, I'm going to expect my thousand word essay. It's very, I'm being very lenient.

05:11:20.500 --> 05:11:27.500
And your thousand word essay do by, I think I said, I said in three weeks, right?

05:11:27.500 --> 05:11:34.500
So that means this is week one. No, this would be week two.

05:11:34.500 --> 05:11:43.500
You have one more week.

05:11:43.500 --> 05:11:49.500
Wait, what's the essay on? Cardcaptor Sakura?

05:11:49.500 --> 05:11:55.500
Cardcaptor Sakura. Everyone needs to watch.

05:11:55.500 --> 05:11:59.500
Everyone needs to watch Cardcaptor Sakura in the two movies.

05:11:59.500 --> 05:12:01.500
Where do we post it?

05:12:01.500 --> 05:12:07.500
I'll post it on my Twitter and then everyone can reply underneath.

05:12:07.500 --> 05:12:16.500
Does it matter how it's written? I'll take MLA citation.

05:12:16.500 --> 05:12:28.500
What about clear card? Clear card is unnecessary. That's only bonus material.

05:12:28.500 --> 05:12:35.500
That's bonus material. You don't have to do that. It's only if you really want to.

05:12:35.500 --> 05:12:39.500
I'll take MLA citation or APA.

05:12:39.500 --> 05:12:45.500
Make sure to alphabetize it.

05:12:45.500 --> 05:12:49.500
Google docs. Not Google.

05:12:49.500 --> 05:12:55.500
Not Google. You have to send it in.

05:12:55.500 --> 05:12:59.500
Actually, better yet. Marles. I'll give you a grade.

05:12:59.500 --> 05:13:15.500
If you send it through Marles, I'll give you a grade on it.

05:13:15.500 --> 05:13:32.500
What's our reward? You want some motivation?

05:13:32.500 --> 05:13:37.500
What's more motivating than a job well done?

05:13:37.500 --> 05:13:45.500
In a little phrase. Heck, I'll tell you I'm proud of you.

05:13:45.500 --> 05:13:51.500
Does Marle have a max word count? I think it's a thousand, which is what I'm saying.

05:13:51.500 --> 05:14:02.500
I'll make it 500. 500 word. How about that? 500 word essay.

05:14:02.500 --> 05:14:10.500
The card after your localization is okay. Yeah, localization is okay too.

05:14:10.500 --> 05:14:27.500
I think Marle is exactly a thousand. I was going to say a thousand characters. It'll be fine.

05:14:27.500 --> 05:14:41.500
You have to write about how much you liked it and how great Sakura is and what you think about the series.

05:14:41.500 --> 05:14:45.500
I want you to learn from it. There you go. I mean so nice.

05:14:45.500 --> 05:14:50.500
I would just torture everyone and be like, you have to watch it in these days and if you don't.

05:14:50.500 --> 05:15:07.500
Well, I guess there's a free vacancy in the cage.

05:15:07.500 --> 05:15:13.500
Honestly. Honestly, I just think it's just fun.

05:15:13.500 --> 05:15:21.500
I think it'll be fun if I can talk to my senpai about something that I really love.

05:15:21.500 --> 05:15:34.500
I actually really like the Novana one. Novana? Is that the company? I like the Novana dub. That's the one I grew up with.

05:15:34.500 --> 05:15:48.500
So I want something in common with senpai and what's better way to connect our hearts than through anime.

05:15:48.500 --> 05:15:59.500
Can I write about how much I love Mercy? You can do that as bonus work.

05:15:59.500 --> 05:16:11.500
I think it'll be fun though. I think all of us watching something together would be really fun.

05:16:11.500 --> 05:16:17.500
And so I can gap about it and everyone will be like, oh okay, I get it. I understand.

05:16:17.500 --> 05:16:24.500
The one from the early 2000s? Yes, that one.

05:16:24.500 --> 05:16:37.500
Do we have to do our sources? No, but it's just fun to mess with you.

05:16:37.500 --> 05:16:42.500
I'm not going to do a watch along on YouTube simply because, wow.

05:16:42.500 --> 05:16:49.500
I'm getting in trouble. I'm getting bonked. I'm getting a little spanky.

05:16:49.500 --> 05:16:56.500
I get a little spanky. So I don't want to do that. I don't want to get in trouble.

05:16:56.500 --> 05:17:16.500
I worked really hard. I worked really hard senpai to not get bonked by YouTube.

05:17:16.500 --> 05:17:25.500
So I worked really hard. I've even been like, I hope I don't get in trouble for uncensoring now.

05:17:25.500 --> 05:17:31.500
But now that I've got monetization, then they can take it away at any point.

05:17:31.500 --> 05:17:40.500
Thank you, boy, for your $1 tip. Congrats on 5,140 subscribers.

05:17:40.500 --> 05:17:47.500
We can celebrate karaoke, right? Do I have 5K already? Thank you.

05:17:47.500 --> 05:17:54.500
Thank you, everyone, for your support then. I really appreciate that.

05:17:54.500 --> 05:18:00.500
My next big goal will be 10K. What do you think?

05:18:01.500 --> 05:18:09.500
Had you been censored on your model this whole time? Oh, yep.

05:18:09.500 --> 05:18:16.500
Will you be able to do song requests on your street on Sunday?

05:18:16.500 --> 05:18:25.500
I don't think so, mostly because I practice these songs.

05:18:25.500 --> 05:18:29.500
10K sounds easy. I don't know. That sounds kind of hard.

05:18:29.500 --> 05:18:38.500
Do you have a favorite Sakura outfit? I love the cat outfit and I love the prince outfit as well.

05:18:38.500 --> 05:18:48.500
I think those are really cute.

05:18:48.500 --> 05:18:52.500
You could do 10K without even trying? Really?

05:18:52.500 --> 05:18:58.500
I don't know. That seems really hard.

05:18:58.500 --> 05:19:05.500
I mean, I would be super happy if we reached 10K, but do you need to watch the movies too?

05:19:05.500 --> 05:19:19.500
Yes, of course. That's how the series ends. It's within the movies. That's how it ends.

05:19:19.500 --> 05:19:25.500
It's really nice. Also, the first movie is really nice and the second movie is really nice too. I think they're really good.

05:19:25.500 --> 05:19:29.500
It's possible. Let's hope.

05:19:29.500 --> 05:19:38.500
My biggest goal is going to be 100K, so Mama Mercy can be like,

05:19:38.500 --> 05:19:47.500
Oh, look, you got a play button. That's nice.

05:19:47.500 --> 05:20:01.500
But you remember us when you get famous? Of course. I always remember all my supplies.

05:20:01.500 --> 05:20:08.500
Is there a manga too or does anime and movies cover it all? The anime and movie pretty much cover it all.

05:20:08.500 --> 05:20:18.500
Actually, the anime has more stuff than the manga.

05:20:18.500 --> 05:20:26.500
Will you name the button after your parents if you can put anything on it? I think I'll just put myself on it.

05:20:26.500 --> 05:20:35.500
I'll get a bigger cage if we get 100K. I'll get a bigger cage for everyone.

05:20:35.500 --> 05:20:53.500
I think if I can order more than one, I think I'd like to give the allure one, strong one, and then get my own.

05:20:53.500 --> 05:21:03.500
I think I'll keep it as my channel title as a memento of it.

05:21:03.500 --> 05:21:13.500
You can order more, but it does cost. I'm willing to pay for the cost of it.

05:21:13.500 --> 05:21:20.500
I'm willing to pay for the cost of it.

05:21:20.500 --> 05:21:26.500
Or getting one to me as well.

05:21:26.500 --> 05:21:35.500
I really want one. Mama's been trying to give me suggestions on how to get to 100K really fast and she was like,

05:21:35.500 --> 05:21:57.500
Sweetie, you should do a film tour of the Costco. People are always interested in watching Costco.

05:21:57.500 --> 05:22:05.500
Yeah, Costco's vlog.

05:22:05.500 --> 05:22:17.500
I don't think I can show a tour of the local Costco because I think that would dox me hard.

05:22:17.500 --> 05:22:29.500
But I admit, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of people who are very interested in Costco.

05:22:29.500 --> 05:22:37.500
Costco dream date. Cost effective and free samples.

05:22:37.500 --> 05:22:44.500
Show off the Costco rotisserie chicken. Yeah, actually those are pretty good.

05:22:44.500 --> 05:22:49.500
I've never seen one, so I just did. You can pass the laptops.

05:22:49.500 --> 05:22:58.500
ASMRRP concept virtual Costco tour.

05:22:58.500 --> 05:23:09.500
I think my favorite, you stalk images and pretend I'm taking you through Costco.

05:23:09.500 --> 05:23:17.500
Oh, that'll be so funny. Okay, I'll see when I can do some pie.

05:23:17.500 --> 05:23:33.500
Imagine if Costco sponsors us. That's not going to happen. We're definitely not family friendly.

05:23:33.500 --> 05:23:42.500
Are there VR chat? I don't think I have a model for or I don't even have like a regular model.

05:23:42.500 --> 05:23:46.500
Costco's family friendly?

05:23:46.500 --> 05:23:54.500
Well, yeah.

05:23:54.500 --> 05:23:59.500
I think so. Yeah.

05:23:59.500 --> 05:24:04.500
Anyways.

05:24:04.500 --> 05:24:09.500
Oh, I'm getting a little, little, I'm getting the little eye burns.

05:24:09.500 --> 05:24:13.500
So I'm going to guess that I'm getting really, really tired.

05:24:13.500 --> 05:24:16.500
He's a placeholder model.

05:24:16.500 --> 05:24:25.500
I'm getting really tired. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow being my day off and then I can hang out with some friends if I wanted to or just rest the entire day.

05:24:25.500 --> 05:24:27.500
Who knows?

05:24:27.500 --> 05:24:35.500
Mercy, your mouth is the most expressive I've ever seen. Excuse me.

05:24:35.500 --> 05:24:40.500
I think it's because I'm an expressive person.

05:24:40.500 --> 05:24:56.500
I think it's because I'm an expressive person. Otherwise, otherwise, I think it would be pretty much the same as any of my other gen mites.

05:24:57.500 --> 05:25:02.500
But yeah, I'll take a good slaps.

05:25:02.500 --> 05:25:19.500
But yeah, I look forward to seeing my supplies on Sunday. I may need breaks if, for example, you know, once again, my arm decides to flare up and be, be, be bad.

05:25:19.500 --> 05:25:24.500
So yeah, I hope everyone has a good one. Okay.

05:25:24.500 --> 05:25:28.500
And I'll see you again next time.

05:25:28.500 --> 05:25:32.500
Speaking for Mercy! Bye!

05:25:54.500 --> 05:25:59.500
Thanks for watching!
