377840	384520	I'll tell you guys why I'm super eat be right now at first. I was gonna do a hand camp stream, but
385400	387400	Um
388000	390000	Yesterday if you saw my twitters, uh
393040	395040	You saw my Twitter I
395640	404000	Yeah, I got a pretty bad rash on my arm my dominant. What's what's worse is it's my dominant arm right now, and I've
405800	409360	But for a stream I've iced it for like one hour and
409960	416080	Basically, it's kind of like it's if it doesn't go away by
417280	419760	If it doesn't go away by by by by
420640	423160	Saturday, I'm gonna go to the doctor
424520	428680	What happened? I don't know it's just an allergic reaction. It just happens sometimes
431760	437200	Which one is your dominant hand my right so it's my right arm that's got
439360	445400	That got so it's like super. It's red. It's as red as like a lobster
447360	452280	It's as red as a lobster and really really itchy and
452800	455600	I accidentally scratched it and it started bleeding
455600	462040	So we're not gonna do that and so I'm going to spare my senpai's worry by not
463200	465200	Doing a hand camp stream
466800	468800	Yeah
469360	475480	Did you smear eggs all over your arm? I don't think so, but I might have touched something that had eggs on it
475480	477480	And then I just like flared up real bad
481120	483120	That just happens
485000	487880	That just happens like it was so red
488760	494080	It was so red like I was like oh dear. That's probably not good
495040	499280	Your allergy is that bad? I have to go to the hospital if it's super severe
500040	502040	especially
503120	505120	Especially if I ingest it
505680	508280	Anyways, so for today's stream instead
508280	514840	We're going to do things one-handed or at least it's possible to play with one hand and that is for today
515200	521640	For my membership. I am so happy to announce that memberships have opened as well as

539840	546980	Make it this far as well. I have lots of goals and we're gonna we're gonna just just smash right through them. I
548880	551400	Think everyone can send super chest. I think yeah

643640	647440	We're gonna add some caveats to the don't scream for membership
648280	655840	If you gift to or more memberships, there is going to be a jump scare sound that will probably scare me
659160	666280	One memberships or if you just joined membership will also play a sound which might scare me if you donate or tip
666680	672320	$10 or more you can do text-to-speech, which will also scare the living bhajibra's out of me
676040	678040	So
679280	681280	And
683480	685240	And

689240	694760	How that works and I don't know why I I don't know why I'm freezing so much. Hold on. I think I know why hold on

707520	713040	Suck at horror. I hate jump scares
714920	719240	If I had flight or fight I would have fight and fight usually involves screaming
723080	724840	If

1949260	1953260	I can always pre-record them. That's not that's fun though. I don't think
1954260	1956260	I
1960260	1969260	It's not as fun if it's not live I think because I think they would want to see everyone's reactions live except for yeah
1972260	1975260	By the way today's word of the day Kohai um
1976260	1978260	Oh

4471780	4472780	I don't like this.
4474780	4475780	I don't like this.
4481780	4482780	I can't look at this.
4484780	4485780	Let's go this way.
4485780	4486780	She heard that.
4491780	4492780	Come on.
4494780	4495780	Evan, come on.
4495780	4496780	Come on.
4496780	4497780	Let's do it.
4498780	4499780	Okay.
4518780	4519780	Come on.
4519780	4520780	Come on.
4549780	4550780	Come on.
4552780	4553780	Sort of a picture.
4555780	4556780	Is there a battery?
4557780	4558780	The pie is no battery.
4574780	4575780	No, that's instinct.
4575780	4576780	It's very odd.
4576780	4577780	That's instinct.
4580780	4582780	The sensitivity is very high.
4585780	4586780	Sensitivity is very high.
4587780	4588780	I am just...
4589780	4592780	I am just literally swallowing my screens right now.
4594780	4595780	Come on, wait.
4595780	4596780	Ten more seconds.
4596780	4597780	Ten more seconds.
4597780	4598780	Ten more seconds.
4598780	4599780	Ten more seconds.
4599780	4600780	Ten more seconds.
4600780	4601780	Ten more seconds.
4601780	4602780	Ten more seconds.
4602780	4603780	Come on, come on.
4610780	4611780	Okay.
4624780	4625780	What now?
4630780	4631780	Good job.
4631780	4632780	Done.
4635780	4637780	Wait, doesn't he just give me congratulations?
4639780	4665780	Wait. What? Is this it over? How come I am still playing? Wait, is this it over?
4665780	4691780	It's over. It's over. It's over. I did it. I did it. It's over.
4691780	4707780	Honestly, Senpai, I don't know if you heard it. I don't know if you heard it.
4707780	4735780	I don't know if you heard, but I slapped my leg a lot. I slapped the armchair a lot when I got really spooked.
4736780	4746780	The sensitivity is pretty high, I think. It was pretty high. I tested it before Scream.
4746780	4755780	The sensitivity was pretty high. I think Senpai saw when I screamed, and now I just followed my scream.
4755780	4782780	I don't know. The sensitivity in the game is a little weird. I felt like some parts I should have been peeking, but I guess it didn't.
4782780	4802780	I guess it didn't. There was a close one, but I managed it. I was so proud of Senpai. Senpai was so proud of me.
4803780	4810780	Oh, sorry. Charlie. Thank you for all the donations, Senpai.
4810780	4815780	Sorry, I couldn't respond to them because I tried not to scream.
4815780	4822780	Thank you so much. Also reluctantly saying 440.
4822780	4834780	Is it text-to-speech only when the game is up? Yeah, so that it can spook me, so that it can scare the living Pajeebers out of me.
4834780	4846780	And you know what? It did. It did. It did, and I was like...
4847780	4852780	Thank you so much for the 10 gifted Venus.
4852780	4864780	Like, let's see. I see you. Daddycorn, I see you bastard. Also, Kauai. You have to do it alone in your room with the door closed and the lights off.
4864780	4866780	Okay.
4866780	4889780	You have no idea. Sperdedly, throughout the stream. Papa. I could hear the spoon. Papa. I think it was Papa. Papa Mercy was using, and I was like...
4889780	4891780	Oh.
4895780	4902780	That was my motion sickness. It's okay, but when I started moving the camera, I was like, oh, okay.
4902780	4908780	Well, I'm feeling a bit dizzy and a sense of vertical, but not so much as like...
4908780	4913780	I don't feel like... I don't know. It seems like it was working.
4914780	4926780	I think... I think the bracelet worked. Like, I didn't throw up. I just felt... I felt nauseous, but I didn't throw up.
4926780	4933780	Are we getting shocks? I just turned it off, but it did shock me throughout, so I was like, okay. Okay. Focus.
4933780	4941780	I was kind of cheating. I was kind of cheating. So, I was like, when it shocks me, focus on that. Focus on that. Focus on that.
4942780	4956780	Oof. Okay, hold on. I put some like, conductive gel on so that it would work better. I'm not sure if it worked, but I think it did. I think it did.
4961780	4966780	I think it did. Oh, man. I did it.
4967780	4982780	Shocks from this... Well, it didn't feel like shocks. It's more like buzzing. I'm wearing this motion sickness anti-nausea watch bracelet, bracelet thing.
4982780	4988780	It's called Emitter. E-M-E-T-E-R-M.
4990780	4994780	It's for this. Heart rate monitor next time.
4996780	5009780	Honestly, I don't know what kind of heart rate monitor I need. I need to do some research for that.
5012780	5024780	You think it helped? I think so? I'm not sure. I mean, I didn't throw up, but we'll have to test this again, Senpai. We're going to have to test this again.
5027780	5033780	Mind you, I was tripling up on my motion sickness stuff, so I had my ginger tea.
5037780	5044780	There will be a next time. Of course there'll be a next time. Not for this. Not for this. Not for this, though.
5045780	5062780	There's history with me and Daddy Korn. We keep finding each other in different B-Tuber chats. It's like the fifth or sixth time we've found each other in LL.
5063780	5066780	True love?
5081780	5090780	Ginger tea helps with my motion sickness. Ginger in general helps with nausea.
5090780	5092780	Nausea and throw yuppie.
5100780	5102780	Are you traumatized, Kohai?
5103780	5112780	Yes? That was cheap. That was really cheap at the end. What the heck? At the end where they had another lady pull up. That was so cheap.
5114780	5116780	Man.
5120780	5124780	I show up at the cages. Senpai, I fool up.
5129780	5136780	I was so mad.
5138780	5144780	Oh my gosh, Johnny. Oh my gosh, I just woke up from a nap with a banging headache. Congrats, Mercy. We love you.
5145780	5147780	I love you too. Good.
5151780	5156780	I beat the game, I think. That was so cheap. That was so cheap. At the bottom, I was like...
5157780	5163780	But there was a lot of times where I swallowed my scream. I swallowed my scream. I only screamed once.
5164780	5175780	But I actually screamed many times. I think at odd times. I actually screamed, but I swallowed it.
5181780	5186780	Oh man, the sounds did not help. The sounds did not help.
5191780	5193780	The sounds did not help.
5198780	5201780	I eat to this. I eat to the end when...
5203780	5207780	The sounds were the scariest parts. Yes, I was so scared.
5211780	5216780	Hey, Johnny, did you know Mercy's gonna be swallowing? Swallowing my screams?
5219780	5223780	I remember he made chicken noises. That's because someone said, are you a chicken, Mercy?
5224780	5227780	And I said yes, and I started balking and clucking.
5229780	5234780	Can you use the 3DO next time? Ambient whimpering sounds?
5241780	5244780	But I thought birds weren't real.
5247780	5252780	Yeah, I got a glass of water and come back to swallowing. You guys can admit it. I hired good.
5257780	5264780	Marcherary assistance. Uh, scared yandere ASMR. I'm scared of other things.
5264780	5273780	But when I'm... I get tunnel vision, Senpai. I get tunnel vision.
5275780	5282780	I get really, really bad tunnel vision, so when I'm like really pissed, all I can see is red.
5283780	5288780	And that's how I, like, run.
5289780	5306780	I remember, um, I think Shibi said I'm hiding my power level from you guys, and I'm just like, oh, yeah, I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit hiding it.
5307780	5315780	I, with the power, I think it's funny, but like, I was like, Senpai, Senpai, please help me. Senpai, Senpai!
5319780	5325780	The 2D games be easier on your emotions like this? 2D games usually are, except for some games.
5325780	5333780	Um, some gay, okay, actress. Shut up. I'm not...
5335780	5343780	I know there's a lot of part where I'm acting, but I'm trying to be really, really kind to Senpais and not really go on Menhera.
5344780	5351780	You have no idea. I went, like, strongy had to be like, they're there, they're there, Mercy, they're there.
5356780	5370780	Because I'm trying not to be that bad.
5373780	5378780	Any chance we can get you to try some 2D horror games if they spook you less than 3D ones?
5379780	5384780	Will you go full Menhera one day? Um, I will probably...
5387780	5390780	I will probably let it slip.
5396780	5401780	I will probably let it slip one day. I really try my best to, to...
5402780	5408780	I know, I know people want to see it, but I'm trying my best to, to be...
5411780	5412780	to be...
5420780	5424780	Oh my gosh! Thank you, Sheldon Zero, for 50 gifts!
5425780	5428780	Holy, holy moly.
5432780	5438780	We love our Menhera, too, Bruce.
5438780	5452780	You have no idea. Before stream, um, well, I went out to, to, to, to, um, to get some ASMR stuff as well,
5452780	5458780	because I was like, okay, well, if, I'd like to do a, do a hand cam for my membership,
5458780	5463780	and then I was looking at my arm before stream, and I was like, I don't think I can do it.
5463780	5467780	I don't think I can do it, because my, my arm is so red.
5467780	5471780	My arm is so red. It's beyond...
5472780	5477780	It is, like, really, really, like, itchy and gross.
5478780	5483780	It's itchy, gross, uh...
5488780	5495780	Really bumpy as well, so, and, like, kind of looks, kind of, and, like, looks really bad,
5495780	5501780	so it's not flaky, but it's, like, bumpy, bumpy everywhere, and, like, super red,
5501780	5506780	so I, I was worried that if I did, if I did a hand cam stream,
5506780	5511780	that some pies would be worried with it.
5514780	5520780	It can't be, it's like, it was, like, bleeding, too, so I was worried that, uh...
5521780	5522780	Do you need to see a doctor for it?
5522780	5527780	I'm going to see if it goes away by Saturday, and if it doesn't go away by Saturday.
5527780	5528780	Um...
5529780	5533780	It's... I'm going to go to the doctor.
5536780	5539780	Bleeding, it's because it started to, um...
5540780	5544780	I scratched it a little bit, and then it got caught, I guess.
5545780	5549780	So I, the entire stream, I'm wearing this, uh...
5549780	5556780	This compass, this, like, arm, arm compass thing, and as well as, uh...
5557780	5560780	You're going to wrap your arms in bandages just like your model has?
5560780	5565780	I didn't have time to go out and buy bandages, and also, um...
5565780	5569780	I was worried because the compress didn't work for a while,
5569780	5575780	that it would become more inflamed, inflamed, uh...
5575780	5581780	if it was stuck under bandages and due to the friction, so I, um...
5581780	5585780	put it, put on a lot of ice, like, a lot of, uh, ice,
5585780	5592780	and you can feel, if I was here, um, if Senpai was here, you can touch my arm,
5592780	5597780	and you can feel, like, really, like, heat radiating out of it.
5599780	5603780	I think it's just an allergy thing. I don't think it's eczema.
5605780	5610780	It's a, it's a, it's a allergy thing. I probably touched...
5611780	5615780	touched, um, touched egg or something.
5627780	5633780	But, yeah, that's why I was, I opted for not to do a hand cam,
5633780	5637780	but I'll, I'll make it up. I'll make it up to Senpai.
5640780	5647780	Gloves? Uh, I'm wearing an arm sleeve right now that has, like, gloves.
5647780	5650780	Did you accidentally ingest an egg product?
5650780	5655780	No, I think this is, uh, if I ingested, it would be a completely different reaction,
5655780	5657780	and I wouldn't be able to breathe.
5657780	5660780	Uh, this one is touching. I'm pretty sure it's just touching.
5662780	5664780	Hold on, are you allergic to latex?
5664780	5666780	I don't have it.
5666780	5668780	Hold on, are you allergic to latex?
5668780	5676780	I don't have any latex on my bed, so when I woke up, it was on my bed, so...
5676780	5679780	or, like, something I bumped into earlier in the day.
5682780	5687780	I, I, last night, I showered because it was, like, really bad,
5687780	5692780	and I'm probably gonna have to ice it after stream again.
5692780	5693780	Bed bugs? No.
5694780	5697780	If it was bed bugs, it would look like bug bites.
5697780	5700780	This is definitely, like, hive slash rash.
5706780	5709780	It was a shower lesson link. I had it before the shower.
5709780	5711780	I wanted to make sure that it was washed.
5711780	5715780	Whatever residue was on my arm was washed off as well.
5717780	5721780	Um, it was washed off, and it's just...
5722780	5726780	This happens sometimes. It rarely happens to me, but...
5728780	5730780	it happens.
5738780	5741780	It, it doesn't happen often, but this sometimes happens.
5741780	5744780	Sometimes it just pops out of nowhere.
5744780	5747780	Honestly, it's, I've seen this happen before,
5747780	5751780	and it usually takes a few days to, to clear up,
5751780	5755780	but unfortunately, Senpai, um...
5755780	5759780	it just happened to have appeared yesterday,
5759780	5762780	and just, and all the way to today,
5762780	5765780	which is really, really sad.
5768780	5770780	I took some Benadryl, too, and when I took Benadryl,
5770780	5773780	the inflammation went down a little bit as well.
5773780	5776780	I put on, like, uh...
5776780	5779780	some lotion as well, so it's good.
5779780	5783780	Did it start as a little weird little bump skull hive?
5783780	5787780	It started out, like, basically kind of like this, like a rash.
5788780	5790780	Could it be from stress?
5790780	5795780	It could be stress. It's just on, it's on my, um...
5795780	5797780	it's just on my right arm, which is unfortunate,
5797780	5801780	because it's my, as this happened before, I think so.
5801780	5804780	I think it's happened before.
5804780	5807780	The universe just didn't want to see a hand cam.
5807780	5810780	It happens. Oh!
5810780	5813780	One time, Senpai's.
5813780	5816780	This is really funny.
5817780	5819780	Um...
5819780	5822780	One time, I was gonna play League.
5822780	5824780	I was gonna try to play League.
5824780	5828780	So the day I set up a whole thing about, like, uh...
5828780	5830780	League,
5830780	5836780	and then my body rejected League.
5836780	5838780	It rejected it.
5838780	5842780	I got sick for three months so badly.
5844780	5846780	Like, the day...
5846780	5851780	the day I was going to play League for the first time,
5851780	5855780	I got so terribly ill.
5855780	5857780	Three months, yeah.
5863780	5866780	Uh, I don't know what happened, really.
5866780	5869780	I took a test for COVID,
5869780	5871780	and it went out negative,
5871780	5876780	but I also had symptoms of asthma, asthma symptoms,
5876780	5881780	and I was throwing up a lot, like, a lot,
5881780	5883780	and I got a lot...
5883780	5887780	I got intermittent fevers, and it lasted for, like, three months.
5889780	5891780	I was like...
5893780	5895780	I was like, oh, my God!
5895780	5897780	The world just...
5897780	5902780	My immune system just did not want me to play League.
5903780	5906780	I blame League because it was the day,
5906780	5911780	the day I was gonna play League that it happened.
5914780	5916780	Like, I'm so toxic.
5918780	5920780	I...
5920780	5922780	I'm so glad I'm not sick like that anymore
5922780	5924780	because, um,
5924780	5928780	I actually lost my voice for the first time.
5928780	5930780	I don't know why.
5930780	5933780	I don't know why that happened.
5933780	5935780	I just thought it was really funny,
5935780	5938780	so I took that as a sign not to play League.
5938780	5941780	I took that as a sign not to play League
5941780	5943780	because, um...
5943780	5946780	I actually lost my voice for a little bit, too,
5946780	5948780	so I...
5948780	5950780	So, people just can...
5950780	5952780	just hear, like,
5952780	5954780	step by step by.
5954780	5956780	Ha ha ha!
5958780	5961780	That was such a huge coincidence.
5970780	5972780	It was such a...
5972780	5975780	a major coincidence.
5976780	5979780	Maybe the arm rash is a reaction to another game.
5979780	5982780	I just... I'm taking this as a...
5984780	5986780	I'm taking this as a sign
5986780	5988780	to... to get...
5988780	5990780	to wait a little bit
5990780	5994780	to do, like, a hand cam or something for some pies.
6000780	6002780	I don't know why.
6002780	6005780	The universe is a little silly thing.
6005780	6007780	Honestly, um, I felt really bad
6007780	6011780	because I had planned all around, like, a hand cam and everything,
6011780	6014780	but, uh, I think this was okay, too. This was okay.
6014780	6018780	Thank you so much for joining me on my membership opening day, as well.
6018780	6020780	I'm so happy.
6025780	6028780	Because, like, I want to be at my best health for some pies
6028780	6030780	to do a, um...
6030780	6032780	to do a hand cam.
6032780	6035780	And if... and I really think
6035780	6039780	some pies would just really...
6039780	6041780	really, uh...
6042780	6044780	really...
6044780	6047780	hate how...
6047780	6050780	and be, like, super worried about how red and bumpy it is.
6050780	6053780	Like, you can even see the bumps through the... the sleeve.
6053780	6056780	The, like, a little compression sleeve.
6064780	6067780	Any other plans for membership stuff you can tell us about?
6067780	6070780	I'm actually still in the middle of planning some membership stuff.
6071780	6075780	Because, um, I've never had membership before, so...
6075780	6078780	and I've never membered to anyone before.
6078780	6081780	So I'm gonna see...
6081780	6083780	and I'm gonna see if Strawny...
6083780	6086780	Strawny will, like, um...
6086780	6088780	help as well. Help out with things.
6088780	6090780	Ah! Azura!
6093780	6095780	I can't leave you... leave you yet.
6095780	6098780	Some pies don't want... doesn't want me to leave.
6099780	6101780	What do you need, uh, Strawny?
6101780	6104780	It's like, oh, I was hoping Strawny could help me with, like...
6104780	6107780	Strawny, I meant to be, like, uh...
6107780	6109780	I was hoping you can... you can help me with...
6109780	6112780	think of, like, membership stream ideas.
6115780	6117780	Oh, my gosh!
6117780	6120780	Azura!
6129780	6134780	Azura!
6134780	6136780	What am I even doing?

6231060	6234180	Hahahahaha! That's singing earlier, Mariah Mercy.
6234180	6236180	Hahahahaha!
6237060	6243300	I'm not, I'm actually pretty excited but also pretty nervous about the karaoke stream
6243300	6248420	because I'm gonna be singing in front of so many people and I'm not even gonna,
6249140	6255380	I'm not gonna, I'm not even gonna, I think I'll just get a little bit of stage fright.
6258180	6259780	I think I'm gonna get a bit of stage fright.
6260100	6262100	Hahahahaha!
6263700	6270260	Honestly, honestly, I'm so thankful everyone, I'm so thankful, I'm honestly super, super thankful.
6273380	6281700	Yeah, wait to hear you sing, I'm sure you do so well, thank you Azura! I don't think I'm as good,
6282420	6289060	I think I'm pretty average, like not terrible but not amazing, but I'm practicing,
6289060	6294820	I'm practicing. I want to be the Arrow Idol you, you can love and enjoy.
6300500	6301060	I really,
6308180	6313060	guys she's being humble, her singing is cute, no, no, no, I'm honest, I'm honest to gosh.
6313140	6321860	I'm really hyped to see my song choices, you, my song choices, probably not the greatest.
6323060	6342580	Oh my goodness! Thank you Lily Lycodes for 20, what the, no, oh, oh, I don't know how to,
6342580	6351300	I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie senpai's, I am flabbergasted, flabbergasted
6353060	6364100	about all these, all these gifted, gifted member memes, memes, memes? I was gonna say subs because
6365060	6369540	brain rot but gifted members, membership.
6374740	6384180	I am, honestly I am so glad to be here, to be part of VLR, I know that it might be frustrating
6386020	6392660	that I, I'm a very slow person but this is, this is like the first time I've had so many eyes on me.
6394820	6402020	You know, this is the first time I've had so many eyes on me and so many kind people,
6403940	6410900	just be, just be super, super, super nice. I hope, can I, can I get sappy a little bit, can I get sappy?
6411700	6427060	Um, sappy, everyone? Like I feel so welcome at VLR, I get, I was so excited to meet you senpai,
6427060	6434660	like honestly, honestly, I'm so, so excited to meet my senpais, like I'm, okay, I'm gonna
6434660	6442420	just admit it, I do stalk, I do stalk my senpais, wait a bit. Now that Twitter likes are turned off,
6442420	6446660	I can't, I can't, it's harder to stalk you.
6456900	6462340	But sometimes I go, if you're on Twitter or something, I go into and I'll be like, oh you
6462340	6468740	have two cats, what's your cat's name? What are you into? Oh, you'll, you live in, I don't know,
6468740	6474340	so-and-so place, how interesting, how interesting, oh your weather there is like this, how interesting,
6474340	6475860	you have a sister, how interesting.
6476740	6491380	Oh my goodness, thank you, default for 10 as well, oh my goodness.
6497860	6501380	Don't worry, I, I notice, I notice all my senpais.
6506820	6511460	I, I try to hide the minhara a little bit
6515060	6520740	because I feel like it's, sometimes I just want to make you happy, I just want to make you happy
6520740	6527700	and I don't want to, to pull you down by, by being super minhara.
6531140	6532420	Don't hide it from me please.
6536740	6544900	Yeah, I mean like, I, I try my best to show my best, my best face here, behind closed doors, I,
6547620	6553540	I'm, I'm not, I'm very much a little bit of a, of a creep.
6558580	6565460	I know minhara is part of the experience, but I don't know, I think I feel like having
6566820	6576580	a minhara breakdown in front of everyone is just not great, so I do it, off stream.
6585540	6593460	Like, oh my gosh, I, I branded and like cried to my, to my gen,
6594180	6600020	gen mates because of just how, how meadow, meadow illinois.
6601220	6601700	I am.
6609380	6613380	You look like the most sane member of VLOR so far.
6616660	6618020	You guys like higurashi?
6621140	6622580	You guys like higurashi?
6623460	6626660	Think about re, rena.
6627620	6630100	Okay, you know how she's kind of sweet at the beginning?
6631060	6632340	And then the itch happens.
6633300	6634580	And then everything goes to heck.
6635620	6642340	Um, right now I'm in the, that, that, the, the early parts.
6654420	6659300	I'm like at the early parts where she's very kind and she's very, you know, loving.
6661060	6662580	I'm at that part right now.
6670100	6672020	I'm at that part right now, like I've,
6675300	6679460	I'm at that part right now, so I'm trying my best to hold it back.
6684420	6686340	No, no, no, no, I, I really mean it.
6686340	6691220	I'm, I'm holding myself back, honestly, honestly, honestly.
6692020	6699620	Honestly, I'm trying to hold myself back simply because I really, I really, I really want
6701780	6706580	to be at my best and, and senpais.
6706580	6711220	I know, I know you're like, oh my gosh, let's make her worse.
6711300	6715220	Menhera, she's going to be so great when she has that Menhera breakdown.
6715220	6716420	It's going to be, I don't think so.
6716420	6721460	I think when you see that Menhera breakdown, you're going to just be worried.
6723060	6724100	You're just going to be worried.
6732180	6734740	You're going to be concerned and worried.
6741300	6748900	So yeah, I, I want to be me and the me that I want to be is,
6752340	6756020	it might slip, it might slip, but most of the time please understand
6756020	6757220	I will be in dairy mode.
6757860	6759060	I will be in dairy mode
6764980	6767060	because I am so in love.
6767060	6767780	I'm so in love.
6768340	6771460	Legitimately, I will stalk you.
6772340	6780820	I, I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say, actually, you know what?
6780820	6782660	Secret, this is a secret.
6786980	6788420	This is a secret.
6791860	6792900	This is a secret.
6798020	6804100	Yeah, I, the Menhera will come out.
6805700	6806260	Don't worry.
6813940	6815460	You, you don't like secrets?
6820900	6821780	Nah, no.
6823380	6825540	I want to keep senpais on their toes.
6826500	6828500	I'll keep senpais on their toes.
6833300	6835060	You can't keep secrets from senpais.
6835060	6836980	What if it's a surprise?
6849620	6850740	It's a surprise.
6851380	6853140	You already cut off all my toes?
6855540	6857140	I'll keep you on your heels.
6874340	6875620	Only if we get to stalk you back?
6875620	6879380	No, stalking is a one-way street and it's my street.
6885540	6898660	Senpais, please understand, it is mine, mine, and mine alone.
6908180	6908660	Okay.
6915540	6927940	No, seriously.
6931140	6940820	Why, senpai, senpais, settle down, settle down, senpai, settle down.
6941460	6946420	Settle down, senpai.
6948740	6949540	You're okay.
6950580	6954420	The surprise is for you to wait for.
6956100	6956420	Okay.
6968820	6970420	Why do you cut another girl stalking us?
6971140	6972580	Maybe both of you need to go.
6978740	6980740	Settle down, that's it.
6986900	6988500	What's in the syringe, Kohai?
6995060	6996980	Don't worry, it's a surprise.
6997300	7004580	Mmm, I want senpais to see all facets of me, but for now, please have this.
7005460	7010100	Please view me as your adorable Kohai, okay?
7010740	7037860	And always remember that I am so, so, so understanding and that you are my,
7038820	7040020	you are mine.
7044420	7046180	When you speak like this, I can't refuse.
7047380	7049460	I feel like that's like a serious voice.
7049460	7054260	I feel like if I, if I want to capture your attention, I have to, I have to,
7055220	7058100	I have to talk in my serious voice.
7058100	7059140	My serious voice.
7060420	7062020	Just like Nyan Tataro said.
7068100	7071620	Let's check out my schedule.
7074340	7075540	I'm so very thankful.
7075540	7076180	Oh, right.
7076180	7078180	I didn't, I was, I went off track.
7078180	7079540	I went off track, senpai.
7081700	7082340	I went off track.
7082340	7086900	I was about to say, I was going to say Nyan Tataro coming back soon, probably not.
7088900	7091300	How many more voices, how many voices do you have?
7092020	7094500	It depends on the situation, what kind of voice I use.
7095540	7097220	Like my phone voice is, hello?
7098740	7100100	Hello, yes?
7101460	7105140	I'm calling about my internet service provider.
7105140	7106340	My provider?
7106980	7109540	Yeah, my internet is down right now.
7109540	7110020	Can I?
7111220	7112500	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
7112500	7112900	That's fine.
7112900	7113220	Thank you.
7113220	7113540	Thank you.
7113540	7114580	Yeah, that's no problem at all.
7120660	7121620	Yes, yes, yes.
7121620	7122100	That's fine.
7128100	7129140	Yes, that's fine, yes.
7132340	7135540	Please, yes, I need my internet.
7135540	7136580	I need my internet.
7136580	7139460	It's very important that I hire internet as soon as possible.
7139460	7141540	Yes, I understand, I understand.
7141540	7144340	But please, can I have some?
7144340	7148900	I'm only being provided four, four up and four down
7148900	7150660	when it should be at least 50.
7155700	7157620	That is like the phone voice.
7157620	7158420	It depends.
7158420	7161780	Or if I'm talking to someone, I, like, you know,
7161780	7166260	like maybe someone like a, like a, like my doctor, I'm like, yeah.
7167380	7171380	So I've been feeling a bit of stomach issues.
7172020	7175060	And, and I have some throat issues.
7175060	7178340	Is there anything that we can do to alleviate it?
7179780	7183780	And then, then you know, your stage voice.
7183780	7184980	Welcome, everyone.
7184980	7189300	Welcome, welcome to Mercy Modi's show.
7190740	7194020	Today we will provide you with an excellent service with,
7194020	7198260	I don't know, catering and blah, blah, blah, you know, things like that.
7199540	7202660	Everyone has a different voice for a different situation.
7202660	7205700	And it happens that when I get a little serious
7205700	7207540	or I want you to calm down or pay attention,
7207540	7209940	it's like, listen here, okay.
7210900	7215780	Okay, listen up.
7220180	7221460	But they're all facets of me.
7222180	7223700	Therefore, all facets of me.
7232740	7235620	They're all facets of different versions of,
7236020	7243060	of when, you know, you, you want to command a different sort of attention
7243060	7244100	depending on the voices.
7244900	7251300	So for example, you know, if you're like talking to a kid,
7251300	7252500	it's completely different, right?
7252500	7255620	You're like, oh, sweetie, are you lost?
7255620	7256500	Where's your mommy?
7257300	7258420	You know, something like that.
7258420	7264180	Something like that.
7264180	7266100	Compared to when you talk to an adult, right?
7268740	7272900	Or if you talk to your dog or your pet, aren't you so cute?
7272900	7274340	Come here, come here now.
7274340	7276180	Come here, come here.
7276180	7278100	Good boy, good boy.
7288660	7298100	I think, I think that's, when you say I have different voices,
7298100	7299140	it's still all me.
7299140	7304100	Just a different, I pick a different type of voice to use all the time.
7305860	7308580	Yeah, my real voice is this though.
7308580	7312500	I feel like, how many members do I have?
7313540	7314340	I don't know.
7314340	7315060	How can I tell?
7315220	7319460	I don't know how to tell some pie.
7319460	7320980	Oh, right.
7325540	7327140	I didn't know you had a mommy voice.
7333540	7340180	I don't want to steal Azra's part, but I guess the mommy voice would be like,
7340500	7345060	I guess if I had to do a mommy voice, actually, it would probably be like,
7346580	7347700	What's up, Eve?
7347700	7349060	Do you want a piece?
7349060	7350420	You want a piece?
7350420	7351540	You want a piece?
7351540	7352820	Okay, okay.
7352820	7353380	Are you ready?
7355060	7358420	Hold on, let me move the microphone to make this sound realistic.
7359540	7360420	There you go.
7360420	7361860	Look how high you are.
7361860	7363140	You're so great.
7363860	7366100	Whoosh, and back down again.
7368580	7369780	Something like that.
7370420	7388420	I don't want to, I don't want to, that's Azra's thing.
7388420	7390020	That's Azra's thing.
7390020	7394820	So if you want like the mommy experience, that's Azra.
7394820	7396340	But I can do like the occasional,
7396900	7400660	um, mommy-ish voice.
7400660	7402100	Sounds like a more like a babysitter.
7402900	7403780	I failed.
7403780	7404180	I failed.
7404180	7406980	See, this is why Azra's the master.
7406980	7410980	This is why Azra's the master at being the motherly,
7410980	7415860	motherly figure, and I am just mercy.
7419780	7422420	Melfi Henry ASMR when honey.
7423780	7424340	Wait, no, no.
7424340	7425220	Hold on.
7425220	7427940	Sweetie, you're kind of catching cold.
7428580	7429220	Wear this.
7430100	7431860	Wait, is that a lipstick mark?
7432660	7434020	Who the fuck was this from?
7434020	7455540	Damn, I sound like an aunt instead of a mommy.
7455540	7456580	This is rude.
7456580	7457380	This is rude.
7458100	7464260	I sound like an aunt.
7464260	7466020	Oh my gosh, I failed.
7466020	7470020	I failed at my attempting a mommy voice.
7470020	7470660	That's fine.
7470660	7471140	That's fine.
7471140	7473620	It's not, it's not who I was meant to be.
7473620	7475060	It's not what I was meant to do.
7479860	7481540	The voice you did in the trailer
7482740	7485140	sounds like a completely different person.
7488340	7494020	I think when I recorded it, I think that's just how the editor did it.
7496260	7498340	I think that's just how the editor did it.
7500740	7501940	What better way?
7501940	7502420	I don't know.
7503620	7504500	What better way?
7505780	7507140	I don't remember my lines.
7511220	7513140	Fear is a top shelf ad-redeasy.
7517540	7526980	I don't know.
7526980	7527380	I don't know.
7527380	7528580	Did it sound like that?
7530820	7531700	I don't know.
7531700	7533700	Maybe I did a voice by accident.
7533700	7534580	I get nervous.
7534580	7535380	I get nervous.
7536740	7540580	I get nervous and I'm just like, okay, okay, I'll do the voice.
7540820	7551380	I was probably also not as cheerful and probably was like, oh my gosh, I'm extra nervous.
7553940	7555300	Mercy is an auntie.
7560100	7562820	Technically, I would be called an aunt and like,
7564980	7567860	depending on like family relation stuff.
7568820	7570820	Even if they're older than me.
7574660	7577140	I can't believe I sound like an aunt instead of mom.
7577860	7578980	See, this is why.
7578980	7579700	This is why.
7579700	7580900	This is why I can't do it.
7585460	7587460	If you were nervous, you didn't sound nervous.
7591700	7593060	I was probably more nervous.
7593860	7600100	When I'm nervous, I guess, I don't know.
7600740	7601860	I don't know what happens.
7601860	7603620	My brain just turns off and just goes, go.
7611620	7614100	If you collab with Azura, I could play the aunt role.
7616180	7618420	I'm not just a regular aunt.
7618420	7619700	I'm a cool aunt.
7623460	7628980	You have no idea, Senpai.
7631140	7634580	When I'm, I used to be so nervous that I would just like,
7636020	7637380	I would be like shaking.
7638500	7642580	But I guess I was still kind of nervous then too.
7642580	7645940	Yeah, I feel like I disappointed people.
7645940	7647460	I feel like I disappointed people.
7648420	7655860	But Senpai's when, when I, when those audios released.
7656900	7658420	I feel like I disappointed Senpai's.
7658420	7660980	And then Senpai's came here and then they heard this.
7662180	7663700	And they're like, she sucks.
7663700	7664500	I hate her.
7664500	7666660	Throw hammers at her.
7667620	7669140	Let's kill her with hammers.
7669860	7678020	What, no?
7681380	7684740	Oh, I meant like, I feel like I disappointed everyone
7684740	7688420	because it's not, it's not like, that's not regular.
7691380	7692820	That's not like my regular voice.
7693700	7698580	This isn't my wheel.
7698580	7700180	My wheel.
7702180	7704020	Don't be so hard on yourself.
7704020	7705220	It's a little hard.
7705220	7719780	I'm, I definitely feel like it's still a dream that I'm here.
7723060	7725780	I guess.
7729700	7731780	It still feels like a dream that I'm here.
7731780	7732980	I'm very happy to be here.
7737540	7738900	I'm so happy to be here.
7738900	7742500	I, it's the most fun I've had in a long time.
7748820	7751220	I feel like the scenario, oh, speaking of,
7752820	7755060	did anyone listen to the Patreon audio?
7758660	7764340	I think I just want to say that I think the current Patreon audio
7765060	7769300	is the one, it's my very first one I recorded.
7770740	7772500	It's the very first one I recorded.
7774820	7777620	So I was definitely very nervous for that one.
7782820	7787220	I was very nervous for that one.
7793140	7799780	And when I did that one, after I, I sent it, sent it to,
7799780	7801540	to management to be like, okay, here you go.
7802180	7808420	I was like, I, this is so fun.
7808420	7809620	This is so fun.
7809620	7810820	I love this so much.
7812980	7818980	I honestly was like, oh, this is such great fun.
7818980	7820820	I'm, I love this.
7820820	7829620	I'm so happy that, that I can do this on the regular.
7831540	7834340	And I was just like, that was when I was like, yeah,
7835300	7836740	I belong in Bealer.
7836740	7837860	I do, I do.
7838020	7843540	But then I question it sometimes, because that,
7843540	7845060	then you have imposter syndrome, right?
7856500	7859780	But then it's in waivers and shakes a little.
7863060	7864180	But no, I'm glad.
7864180	7864740	Oh, shit.
7864740	7868740	I meant to tell you the story of like, like being a little sappy.
7869700	7870500	I'm, thank you.
7870500	7878660	I'm so thankful that I have monetization and that I could,
7879300	7883220	there's a possibility I could do this full time,
7884020	7885540	because I want to tell some pies.
7885540	7887060	I want to tell some pies.
7887700	7892580	I know this sounds, this may sound weird and stuff,
7893540	7893780	but
7896580	7899940	Papa, before, before, before I was born,
7902260	7903140	before I was born,
7905780	7910900	Papa Mercy used to live outside of a car, out of a cardboard box.
7916020	7920340	And so, and for Christmas and stuff,
7921060	7924740	Christmas is and stuff, I would have a,
7928820	7929540	I would have,
7933780	7937620	yeah, before he came, he came here, he used to live in a cardboard box
7938180	7939540	and he made his way up.
7939540	7947380	And then most of my life we were still not a, not quite in, in like a very,
7947380	7950420	very good, good situation.
7951220	7956980	So growing up, it was, it was like, gifts were like donation gifts and stuff,
7956980	7962500	and clothes were, were donated, or donated, and
7966660	7974420	so being able to be here, be here, have, having,
7975380	7978420	spending money, a bit of spending money, and
7982020	7987300	making my way, using, working my, working my butt off to buy this,
7987300	7988900	this streaming setup and stuff.
7988900	7990660	I'm so glad it paid off.
7990660	7995940	I'm so, so, so glad it paid off, and that my dreams have come true,
7995940	8004020	and that, that I got to meet my senpais, and I'm so, so, so happy,
8004020	8004580	so happy.
8008020	8008740	I'm so happy
8011220	8013140	that I'm here.
8015540	8019460	So thank you so much for all the generosity and all the kindness,
8019460	8023380	senpais have shown me, I truly, truly, truly, truly appreciate it.
8024100	8026180	Like honestly,
8028180	8031460	can you, can I write equipments off in taxes?
8032420	8035860	These are over, like, these are years, years old.
8035860	8037060	These are years old.
8039380	8044340	So I'm glad that I can actually put them to full, full, full use,
8045780	8047780	full use for my senpais.
8050020	8050820	I'm so happy.
8053380	8054020	Thank you.
8056260	8058420	Thank you for the dollar, Logan.
8059300	8064580	Ago, you're all worth all this, and way, way more mercy.
8064580	8068660	I wish we had the resources to give you what you actually deserve.
8068660	8071380	It's okay senpai, it's okay, it's okay.
8072500	8085220	Being here, and being, you know, being here, and talking,
8085300	8090340	and entertaining everyone is our, is my favorite thing to do.
8091380	8094820	Honestly, and when I get off stream, sometimes I go, I miss them.
8101060	8103620	What's your type of senpai if you don't mind me asking?
8104900	8105380	Kind?
8107460	8109780	My favorite senpai is someone who is kind.
8116020	8122180	And I think that applies to all of you.
8127700	8131220	Ellen Meij, her favorite senpai is a slow runner.
8141780	8144660	Well, I can't seem to argue that either.
8145540	8150500	I can't argue that either.
8152180	8153220	Oops, you caught me.
8162660	8164420	Kind, loyal, and won't run, right.
8165060	8165780	Okay, correct.
8167060	8168500	Thank you for the 420.
8169460	8171780	Congratulations on monetization.
8171780	8174980	You're literally the only Meiju I've ever seen play Harvester.
8176180	8181300	Stay based, hope to see you play more obscure indie slash old plot
8182020	8182900	heavy games.
8182900	8184260	You're the best go-high ever.
8184260	8185700	Thank you, Nick Foggy.
8187620	8188900	How do I say this?
8188900	8193700	I don't think Harvester is very obscure.
8193700	8196420	I think Harvester is quite well known.
8198420	8201540	I just don't think a lot of VTubers play point and clicks.
8202420	8205860	I just don't think they play a lot of point and clicks.
8216420	8217860	I've never heard of it until you played it.
8217860	8219060	Man, maybe I'm...
8226500	8229300	I think maybe it's because I knew the history of it.
8229300	8231460	I thought I thought that I...
8233140	8234900	I think maybe that I was...
8234900	8236100	I thought that, perhaps.
8238340	8240500	Me, I do Azarel also play point and clicks.
8240500	8241540	Nice, nice actually.
8246100	8249060	Maybe it's because I knew the history about it that I was like,
8249060	8250500	oh yeah, it's a common game.
8253220	8254660	Is it very meiju?
8255060	8263140	Can you guys tell that my sense of what's popular and what's not
8263140	8265220	is severely skewed?
8267220	8269060	It's severely skewed?
8281300	8282660	Point and click brain round.
8282660	8283780	Honestly, honestly.
8284500	8287140	Every time like, oh yeah, people are like,
8287140	8289380	oh, have you played this really niche game called...
8291940	8295140	I have no mouth and I must scream and I'm like, oh yeah.
8295140	8296660	Isn't it popular though?
8296660	8298500	Isn't it like, didn't it win awards and stuff?
8302980	8305700	Like Harvester, I feel like everyone kind of knew it.
8308980	8311140	Thank you for the $3.33,
8311940	8313620	how do I become your favorite senpai?
8314180	8315540	I don't play favoritisms.
8318340	8327460	I don't play favoritism except, you know, like the girlies, the like...
8329860	8333700	Like, if Serenity says she's like a senpai then like,
8335140	8340660	technically she has rights and like the Yume plus girls, they have...
8342100	8344660	They work to dig the...
8344660	8352020	They also do some work to dig the holes outside to hide the bodies.
8357540	8361060	So they get a little bit more but I let my...
8361060	8363060	I let my...
8373460	8375460	I let my...
8378900	8380340	Yeah, content creator rights.
8380340	8385380	They have a little bit more things but like honestly,
8385380	8390820	if you told me who would I choose Serenity or Senpai, I would choose Senpai.
8391780	8394820	I'm sorry Serenity, I...
8394820	8396740	I'm sorry but you get it, right?
8396740	8397220	You get it.
8411940	8413860	But like Serenity is a pretty close second.
8414340	8421380	That's surprising.
8422340	8428820	You have no idea how much joy Senpai, you give me, honestly.
8433460	8436100	You have no idea how much joy you all give me.
8438980	8440660	And if you weren't my number one,
8440660	8446660	why would I try to try so hard to keep you here, you know?
8450500	8458340	On a scale of one to ten of joy, one million, one million, three billion!
8466180	8468820	You just have to stay on course, okay?
8468900	8470100	You just have to stay on course.
8480820	8482180	You just have to stay on course.
8483460	8488740	If Senpai steps out of line from my fairy tale, I might get a little mad.
8489780	8494500	But overall, I do love you very, very, very, very much.
8494820	8500900	It's not a bit, it's not an act, I truly do.
8504020	8507460	Because without you, I wouldn't be able to have so much fun.
8507460	8509940	And every day is like a date.
8511300	8515380	And I'm always, I always go to bed thinking about my Senpais.
8515380	8518660	And I always go to bed and I wake up in the morning going,
8519460	8520820	I want to hang out with Senpai.
8532260	8535860	I won't stalk Senpai too much.
8536980	8543540	As long as Senpai doesn't look into me too much either.
8543620	8548660	Okay, I won't show up at Senpai's house unannounced, unless...
8551220	8553140	You know what, actually, no, I get that right, never mind.
8553140	8554340	I get that right, you do not.
8555700	8564420	Why? Because you're stuck in the cage!
8574500	8585380	But like, I don't want, I don't, I really, my boundaries is that I just don't want to like,
8586580	8591220	I literally do not want Mama and Papa Mercy to get involved.
8593060	8594420	Because I would be pissed.
8603620	8614420	And like, I, as I said, back, back a while ago, I do, I did have quite the violent tendency.
8615300	8617140	And it might come out again.
8622260	8623540	It might come out of the end.
8628420	8629220	Which is why...
8629860	8638100	Which is why I got a lot of maros saying like, what did you mean by like, don't get overly attached?
8638100	8640580	I mean, I meant like, don't get my family involved, don't like,
8642260	8647700	don't like, you know, bother my family or my friends about that.
8648900	8651380	Because I, I will get pissed, I will get pissed.
8651380	8656020	And probably like, you will see more of the Yan and not any of the Dairy part.
8659940	8670500	Like, I thought, I thought, I thought the way, I realized the way I worded it is weird.
8671220	8675780	But I meant, I meant it as like, don't get too attached as in like, you call my parents and
8677620	8682020	my, my IRL friends have to lock their doors or something because I will...
8684020	8685620	I don't think there would be another Senpai.
8690180	8694420	I don't think there will be a Senpai because I'm very protective.
8696740	8698100	I'm very protective of them.
8704500	8708900	And I think I would get pissed, I would get pissed.
8708900	8713380	I think I legitimately would get pissed because that is not a part of my fairy tale.
8713940	8716740	That is not a part of my fairy tale happy ending.
8719300	8723460	You would mess with your family?
8723460	8724020	I don't know.
8725780	8727780	It's, I don't know.
8729780	8733540	But there was a lot of times where I had to get involved because
8734180	8736820	I, I am protective of my family.
8736820	8741860	Like for example, someone, okay, this is a long time ago, so don't worry.
8743620	8747140	Don't worry, someone assaulted my
8749300	8753140	Papa Mercy, my father, and I was so fucking pissed.
8753140	8758820	I was about to get over there with like a knife and just go at it.
8759540	8761140	Just like go crazy.
8765460	8768660	So I'm very protective of them.
8768660	8770180	I'm beyond protective of them.
8770820	8780660	So, yeah.
8783380	8785220	Like I was, I was, I was mad.
8786820	8787380	I was mad.
8791140	8794740	You mean like a stranger physically attacked him like in a parking lot?
8794740	8796340	A neighbor, a neighbor did.
8797300	8802180	And a neighbor did and the cops are called and I was about to like
8802180	8803540	break down that neighbor's door.
8804580	8808260	I moved, luckily, but I was about to break down that neighbor's door.
8809780	8810740	The one who stole his presents?
8810740	8811380	No, no, no.
8811380	8812340	That's a different neighbor.
8814420	8815460	Different neighbor.
8815460	8822340	I, the police did get involved and luckily, so I calmed down quite a bit, but I was,
8827140	8827700	I was mad.
8828820	8833060	And honestly, sometimes some senpais get me really mad too.
8833060	8835620	Like some senpais get me really pissed.
8836660	8842980	I don't know if those are real senpais or like fake senpais, but some senpais make me really pissed.
8847540	8850260	Because like sometimes I feel like my boundaries are
8851220	8858180	like probably fake senpais, but sometimes, like sometimes my boundaries are like they say mean
8858180	8860020	things and I'm just like pissed.
8868500	8870980	Make sure to say something if we make you pissed.
8870980	8875300	You know, you know, you know, if I'm pissed.
8876020	8883780	You know, if I'm pissed, there will be a few signs to know that I'm pissed.
8889060	8889700	It's not me, right?
8889700	8892740	No, no, no, I'm, I've been, no, no, no, no, no, no.
8897860	8901380	Like I think you'll know when I get pissed because there's some obvious signs.
8902260	8907460	The first sign of being annoyed is if I go, if I start talking like this,
8908180	8909700	it means I'm really fucking annoyed.
8912500	8916260	And that's when senpais need to settle down a little.
8919460	8920660	And then I get really pissed.
8920660	8921540	I will call mods.
8922820	8926500	You know, you know, if I'm pissed, I will call the mods.
8931540	8940180	But no, no, no, sometimes I get pissed on messages when I see certain messages.
8943780	8946820	Yeah, if you're, they're trying to push boundaries and stuff.
8946820	8949220	Most likely fake senpais, yeah.
8950340	8954500	I even hesitate to call them senpais because then I'm just like,
8955300	8956900	are they a pretender?
8956900	8958180	Are they a faker?
8958180	8959380	Are they not in the cage?
8962340	8963940	I apologize in advance.
8963940	8964580	Don't worry.
8967460	8968900	Water off a duck's back.
8968900	8971940	I can forgive pretty easily, except for certain things.
8974260	8975380	Except for certain things.
8975380	8978660	Then I don't forgive at all, ever.
8982500	8983300	Boundaries how?
8992340	8996340	Things that I don't like crossed, for example, would be like.
9003700	9006900	Let's give, let's give a fairly light example that I don't like.
9007620	9011140	My fairly light example that I don't like is a backhanded compliment.
9011380	9022340	Another thing that's like, oh my God.
9023220	9023780	Pam!
9025380	9029060	B-C-O-L of Play Asia.
9031060	9032580	Congrats upon attization.
9032580	9034180	Thank you, Pam.
9034180	9034740	Thank you.
9036820	9038100	Thank you, Raiders.
9038100	9041460	Hello, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
9041460	9044500	This is my monetization stream, and we just finished play.
9044500	9045620	No, just wait.
9045620	9047620	How long have I been yapping for?
9047620	9049460	How long have I been yapping for?
9050260	9050980	Oh, I don't know.
9050980	9052740	Anyways, I did play.
9052740	9057220	I did play Don't Scream, and I was screaming internally so hard.
9057220	9057700	I was like.
9059540	9060180	But like more like.
9064340	9065460	Boundaries talking to her.
9065460	9066020	Forget it.
9066020	9066740	Forget about it.
9068980	9070340	Was I talking for 40 minutes?
9078340	9080340	Why does chat need to know how to push your buttons?
9080340	9081540	Are you sure that's a good idea?
9081540	9082020	You're right.
9082020	9083220	I'm going to shut the fuck up now.
9089460	9089940	You know what?
9090660	9091220	Silence!
9092420	9093540	Silence!
9096740	9097220	You're right.
9097220	9098180	I'm going to shut the fuck up.
9099460	9102020	See, I get loose-lipped when I'm around Senpai,
9102020	9104100	because I feel so comfortable around Senpai.
9111620	9114100	See, this is why we have secrets between us.
9114100	9117300	We have secrets between us because it can be leaked, okay?
9117300	9120260	Sometimes there are fake Senpais amongst us.
9120900	9121460	They're rude.
9122580	9123460	I must be cold.
9128180	9129860	Oh, thank you.
9129860	9130660	You suck at best.
9130660	9132260	Even though you can't sit the zap too,
9132260	9134180	we always ended up getting it anyways.
9137620	9138500	No, I don't want secrets.
9138980	9139700	It's secrets.
9140340	9140980	Respect them.
9144820	9146580	I don't know all about Kawaii.
9148660	9153300	But Senpai made a good point saying that you could use it against me.
9153300	9153940	And you know what?
9154900	9155700	That's fair.
9155700	9157940	So therefore, tight-lipped, I be.
9167780	9169380	Mercy, you've been talking for over an hour.
9169380	9171300	I really should stop talking.
9171300	9173300	Honestly, I really should stop talking.
9177780	9178820	Which lips?
9178820	9180180	The one on my face.
9186500	9186980	Ah!
9198180	9198820	Let's be real.
9198820	9200500	If you were playing on Maury, it would be longer.
9200500	9201940	Nah, I feel like I shouldn't.
9201940	9202820	I shouldn't, yeah.
9202820	9204740	Because I feel like a lot of people take
9205620	9208180	what I say, when I yap, out of context.
9210100	9210820	And I'm just like...
9210820	9216900	I'm not very articulate with words.
9217860	9219140	I'm not good with words.
9221060	9222900	So I feel like I shouldn't yap as much.
9228260	9229060	I shouldn't yap.
9230260	9232820	I shouldn't yap so much because I always get marbles.
9233860	9235380	Marbles by the end going,
9235380	9236660	what did you mean by this?
9241460	9245540	What did you mean by this knife?
9245540	9246020	I'm like...
9252100	9253300	I shouldn't yap.
9253300	9254660	I should stop yapping.
9254660	9276020	I will yap if you promise not to take everything I say into a cruel position.
9276260	9285540	Because I get marbles and I'm like...
9288420	9289780	I shouldn't even be telling you this.
9289780	9291140	This is how loose-lipped I am.
9291140	9292820	See, this is why I shouldn't yap.
9292820	9295620	Because then I tell you things that I wasn't planning to tell you.
9295620	9296260	Man, I...
9301780	9302260	Man!
9306980	9310420	Is it this rash talking or is it me?
9310420	9312900	It's probably the, yeah, the rash talking.
9314100	9314820	And I am...
9317300	9317780	Man.
9327940	9328980	It's the evil rash.
9328980	9330580	It's making me say things.
9332900	9335300	Make sticky notes to remind you of things not to say.
9336020	9336820	Man!
9344260	9346340	My yandere can't help but overshare.
9346340	9348660	I love how trusting she is before she ends me.
9348660	9349940	Oh my gosh.
9349940	9350820	I know.
9350820	9353860	I feel so comfortable around Senpai.
9353860	9354500	And then I'm like...
9358420	9363460	No, now Senpai's in order for you to keep the secret forever.
9363460	9364100	It's over.
9366980	9368020	It's over.
9369460	9371620	I overshare a lot.
9371620	9372980	That's a bad habit of mine.
9385380	9387140	Are you going to take our away our tongues?
9387780	9388180	Yoink!
9390260	9391540	No, no flavors.
9391540	9392020	No tests.
9392740	9393540	No taste tests.
9394260	9395140	It's just gone.
9396980	9398500	You should avoid doxing yourself.
9398500	9401060	I'm very careful about that.
9415300	9417060	I have no tongue and I must scream.
9418020	9419860	That would be a fun parody game.
9419860	9423300	But then again, it's kind of like a silly game itself.
9424420	9425780	I have no mouth and I must scream.
9426100	9428100	But then again, it's kind of like a silly game itself.
9434500	9435300	Overshare.
9435860	9437700	No, I'm so bad.
9438500	9439300	Everyone.
9439300	9439940	Everyone.
9439940	9441540	Senpais, please look.
9441540	9442180	Please look.
9443300	9444020	Right here.
9444660	9446180	I learned this from Strawny.
9446180	9446500	Ready?
9447220	9447860	Right here.
9450580	9450900	OK.
9453060	9453940	Begetty beam.
9456020	9485580	So how's the games and pie?
9485900	9490460	I did a good job at hiding my screams right?
9499100	9501500	Congratulations monetization! Yes, yes, yes!
9509340	9510620	The game was great, yeah!
9516300	9523420	How many members are you up to? I don't actually know how to check that senpai!
9524540	9527420	I don't know how to check that senpai!
9536940	9539340	Thought it would take longer for you to to beat.
9539500	9546620	Screaming internally! I have learned a new trick today was that I can scream internally.
9549100	9552220	I just noticed you have emotes mercy! Yeah, do you like them?
9552940	9554060	Strawny picked them out.
9558860	9563660	At least one, I think I have at least one meh, one member.
9564620	9575580	Oh, speaking of, I finally relaxed! I finally relaxed a little bit yesterday.
9576380	9581260	Yesterday, so I could have my first day off, although I did work put a little bit on my day off.
9582140	9588060	It's my day off from streaming, not day off from working and at violor.
9594140	9601500	I found, I found, I found some fun, but I found one white hair!
9603980	9612060	I found one white hair! Oh my gosh! I was like, oh, I went, I guess, I guess I was really stressed, huh?
9612060	9614060	Hahaha!
9621580	9625020	Your schedule still make a pack! That was my mistake!
9627100	9632940	The week after is only three streams! I double checked! I triple, triple, triple checked!
9633340	9643500	I triple checked, I quad triple checked, made sure I have only three streams next week!
9653180	9658220	The one, the one white hair! Probably since debut prep! I was like,
9658220	9664620	ahhh! You know who found it? You know how, who found it? I was sitting down and then
9664620	9668780	Mama Mercy looked over and she's like, sweetie, you have a white hair! And I was like, ahhh!
9676780	9683660	Actually, it's, apparently that happens to me quite a bit. I mean, like, when I was in high school,
9683660	9692780	I had a white hair, but that doesn't make sense! Like, one white hair was like, completely white!
9697020	9705820	I was like, oh, if I'm under great duress, it's, it turns, one, one strand turns completely white!
9709020	9710140	With a little bit of like,
9714220	9721180	real talk, those can just happen regularly because of circumstances due to cellular,
9721180	9725820	cellular irregularities. I have one pale white beard hair every other time I shave.
9728780	9736220	What? You can't call me a hag just from one, you can't call me a hag just from one, one white hair!
9736860	9742300	You can't just call me a hag from that.
9747660	9751980	I just, I'm just saying that I had one because I feel like I probably overworked myself, yeah.
9755260	9761740	We love hags! Honestly, when someone called me a hag for the first time, I was like, what?!
9762700	9770140	I was so upset, and I went to look it up, and then I, and all of it was still in salt,
9770140	9774860	so I was too upset, and then someone had to tell me, no, no, no, hag means, it's, it's a good thing,
9774860	9786700	and I was like, I don't believe you, and then, and then, and then, and then I found out, yeah,
9787660	9788540	it's a good thing.
9793740	9797820	I found out it was a good thing. I, I was upset at first though, I was like,
9800300	9801340	how dare you?
9808380	9813740	Slaying is hard! I'm, I'm having trouble keeping up some like, some, some sayings and stuff.
9817420	9826940	Slaying is hard. I just can't keep up anymore. Take me back to the days when like, the big,
9826940	9835500	trendy word of the day was epic. That was so epic. Wow. Epic story, man.
9836060	9848940	Yolo. Leet.
9852700	9856540	Like a boss. Oh my gosh, yeah.
9866460	9867500	Hell.
9871820	9876700	Booper was hot for a hot minute, was it? Oh my gosh.
9879260	9881740	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, O'Reilly? O'Reilly?
9886380	9886940	O'Reilly?
9896460	9906620	What else did they have? Oh, and memes back there were like, back then was like, oh shoot,
9906620	9917900	what was the first one I saw? The philosopher? I think the philosopher was, was, was the memes
9917900	9925180	where they had it on like the kind of like, alternating, not the alternating like, I don't know,
9925180	9930380	background with the impact font on top and impact font at the bottom.
9937100	9941100	Oh, oh, oh, I made you a cookie, but I ate it.
9944940	9949580	Or, or the, uh,
9949740	9956780	what is it? The actor, what's his face from?
9963260	9971260	The Willy Wonka man leaning on, on the, on, on a hand going saying something that's like,
9972620	9973660	I don't remember that one.
9973740	9982380	Uh, Gene Wilder? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where his leaning is like, oh, tell me about this, blah, blah, blah.
9987020	9989500	These are ancient. I'm trying to think of like,
9990220	9994220	sums that I can barely remember them.
9994380	10001340	Ra, Ra means I love you in dinosaur.
10004780	10008620	Yeah, the ones that saw condescending. Yeah, I can barely remember them.
10008620	10012300	What's that angry wolf one? I remember seeing that sometimes.
10013020	10021820	Good guy, Greg. Yeah.
10023900	10028460	Can I has cheese bugger insanity wolf? Really?
10030780	10032940	What's it called insanity wolf? It's the wolf one.
10036060	10041500	Chuck Norris. All right. I remember Chuck Norris. Everyone kept on doing Chuck Norris stuff.
10043020	10052380	You should do an old meme tier list. Can I even remember old memes?
10053740	10063500	Memes go by so fast nowadays. I can't keep up with them.
10067420	10069500	Chuck Norris can count your infinity twice.
10072700	10075820	I don't remember a lot of these. These are like,
10079340	10081180	these are like the ones where I'm like, huh.
10086700	10087660	I wonder.
10093660	10101020	Isn't Doge kind of new though? Is this kind of new? Maybe I'm out of, I'm out, I'm not much.
10101900	10103340	I'm out of time.
10108380	10109980	Doge is like a decade old.
10116940	10119660	Man, time is a construct.
10119660	10132460	I'm probably too much of a zoomer to know about hamster dance and dancing, baby.
10143820	10145340	Things I can barely remember.
10149820	10150780	I also remember.
10156220	10165740	She's gen X is over. Stop. Stop. Stop. Okay. Listen. Listen, guys. Listen, guys.
10168380	10169500	Listen, senpai.
10169900	10183900	I feel like, I feel like some of you have put me into age brackets and I'm just like,
10188460	10192140	I don't know if you will. I don't know. I don't know.
10199580	10204940	Into age brackets and I don't think they're entirely correct.
10211820	10217100	Don't let me in. Okay. Some senpais, some senpais have put me into age brackets
10217980	10220620	and I don't think they're entirely correct.
10221580	10232540	I feel like I've given many hints to the age range and I feel like all of it is being missed.
10241100	10245180	You remember meeting Julius Caesar? What do you mean? I'm him.
10245820	10248940	I'm him.
10264060	10266620	I'm skibbity straight
10266620	10271980	bussin. What else did I say?
10273820	10275420	God damn.
10278620	10279180	Zam.
10290140	10290380	She.
10290380	10300140	She. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Rizzler.
10320460	10332140	I can't catch up nowadays. I can't catch up nowadays.
10342540	10346140	Give me days. Give me damn. I don't know.
10346460	10351500	How's your back doing? It's fine. My back is fine.
10356380	10364700	I don't remember. I remember finally being taught like a lot of slang and I just kept on using them
10364700	10367900	and then my friends were like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
10377020	10389580	And then and then the new things are different.
10389580	10401020	For real. For real. F.R.F.R. straight bussin. No cap on God.
10406220	10407020	Is there anything else?
10419900	10426380	I can't think of any anyone.
10429020	10441900	Yeet. Goon. Yeah. Oh, shit. Right. I'm goon. Maxing. I don't know what people say. I keep on.
10441900	10458220	I keep on hearing that. I'm in Max and my gooning.
10472780	10487900	I forgot. Maxing was like a thing. Sometimes I can't even. I don't understand when sometimes
10487900	10489420	when someone says things.
10494620	10496780	When someone says things, I'm like, what do you mean?
10497260	10506300	I'm rep maxing blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, wagey, cagey, something, something.
10507740	10513500	And I'm like, okay, I got it. I got it.
10516220	10519260	I got it. No, I don't freaking get it.
10519420	10531580	It's all goon maxed together.
10531740	10543900	I think.
10547100	10557420	I think. Wrong side for that. I meant, I meant, I, a boss, a boss. Where, where the, where the at?
10557420	10570220	Let us add him. A boss. A boss. What I do with this? What I do with these ropes?
10580940	10585260	A boss.
10587580	10592700	That's, that's what we mean, YouTube. That's what we mean. We mean, we're, we're, we're maxing,
10593660	10597500	we're maxing the goons, like the henchmen.
10604460	10611260	A boss. What do we say? We take these fellas over to the docks and get them sleepy with them fishes.
10611260	10618140	Use cousin troubles for the coal.
10621260	10635100	Yeah, correct. We are upping our henchmen game, not anything else.
10641660	10653100	Not anything else.
10657260	10667100	We hired goons.
10671980	10682700	We gotta, we gotta get them boys. They gotta get them boys. Come on.
10688380	10694220	Aren't you all just strawnees hired goons, like henchmen? No, we're strawnees daughters.
10695100	10697100	We're strawnees daughters.
10698060	10701900	We're strawnees daughters.
10704140	10708460	Her trained, her trained little succubi.
10713820	10717580	Fiendishly taking away your sleep and
10718220	10734780	taking away your sleep and, and making sure, making sure you're, you're uh,
10735500	10746620	you're uh, you're, you're groomed. You're groomed by us.
10746940	10758460	Yes, yes, that was very safe work.
10758780	10777900	As in grooming our hair and stuff? Yeah, like that. We're grooming each other.
10779340	10783660	Yeah. No, actually it's only one way. I'm grooming you. Yes.
10783660	10791660	The veal or barbershop, barbershop quartet.
10795420	10801500	Wait, what's six? Wait, what's six instead of quartet? What's the, what's, what's six?
10814620	10817660	No, I can't say it like that. No!
10824220	10833660	You know what? Someone, someone should draw that. All of us as a barbershop.
10833980	10844380	It's all a part of the plan.
10851100	10853020	I think it is actually gonna fail.
10855580	10859820	That's really funny though. Everyone, we should, we should be drawn like that.
10864540	10866620	That's so funny.
10873980	10879340	Ah man, I talked too much. What do you want to be with? Well, there's six of us.
10883020	10889980	There's six of us. Put a mustache on all of them. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
10893980	10901820	I take a look at my ginormous
10904140	10907260	and the travels just keep on mountain away.
10913820	10915980	I take a look at my ginormous
10924620	10930060	You're 30 wrong.
10935900	10944060	I know that song. No, I'm not. Stop guessing my age. I know this because of that song.
10944060	10948940	How old is that song anyways? I'm surprised it hasn't, hasn't been like picked up again.
10953900	10956860	I'm not 30 and I know that song. See?
10959420	10963820	I'm eternal. I'm eternal. I'm forever your Kohai.
10971420	10972220	Oh my gosh.
10975420	10977740	They broke up like 15 years ago. Oh, shit.
10984220	10988620	I'm in college age.
10993820	10997260	I thought Amy was an eternal one. Yeah, she is. I just want to feel like it.
10998620	11000620	I think of everyone, I think.
11003660	11007980	I'm the only one who's sort of normal. When I say sort of normal, I feel like
11008140	11013580	there's other than, you know, you know, the obvious.
11025740	11033340	The fight normal. Well, I'm not like another creature.
11033660	11044140	I'm not like, you know, I'm not like an animal and I'm not, I don't have like mystical powers or I'm not.
11046940	11051500	You know, I'm not like a goddess or, you know, I don't,
11053420	11056300	yeah, I'm kind of normal compared to everyone else, right?
11056540	11066460	I'm like human. I'm, yeah, you mean human, right? You're right. How, how very bigoted of me to say that.
11069100	11071100	I am just a human.
11071100	11089900	It's like, yeah, I guess I'm like the only one without superpowers, I guess.
11089900	11102540	As, as, as much as you can say.
11107660	11110700	I mean, like, Amy's like, ageless now.
11113980	11119020	Inhuman strength and agility when Senpai is naughty. Yeah, that's trainable, I guess.
11119980	11125100	Adrenaline and, adrenaline is a really powerful thing, don't you think, Senpai?
11132620	11138860	Not even the dragon trapped in your right eye. It's not a dragon trapped in my right eye.
11139500	11143740	It's the black flame trapped in my right eye.
11150860	11159900	We need to see to confirm. You know, I just, for that, you don't get to see it.
11162860	11164620	The dragon of the darkness flame.
11165340	11184300	My anger is what makes it appear. My eyes glow red when, when it happens.
11185020	11194540	I'm, these band-aids contain, contain the power. And if it's, and if it's released,
11195180	11199500	all will, will perish, perish by a million suns.
11204780	11208860	Your eyes are red though. They're not glowing red, are they?
11214940	11226780	It's like, it's like I have to capture you, Senpai. I have to capture you.
11227340	11233980	The dragon, the dragon is, is telling me I have to be with you. It's our destiny, our fate to be together.
11233980	11247660	You don't understand. We've been together since forever. We're tied by the red string of fate.
11264620	11280300	We're, we're destined to be together. I mean, like, in, in, in a previous life, you were my prince and I was a prince.
11287100	11291660	And the life before that, I was Julius Caesar.
11293980	11297660	And the life before that, I was Julius Caesar.
11323980	11337660	Can I get some avays and chat?
11353980	11375660	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
11384300	11394860	Sorry, I have bubble tea. I bought it earlier.
11403820	11408540	Thank you, Senpais. Oh my gosh, I've yapped for so long right now. What flavor?
11409100	11412460	Green tea strawberry.
11417340	11425420	Green tea strawberry is the bubble tea flavor. Um, fun fact, tapioca sometimes, uh, I order,
11425420	11433980	I always order it without the tapioca because, uh, tapioca sometimes is coated in egg white,
11433980	11438060	so I can't have it. So I have to order it with either just jelly or nothing.
11444220	11445500	Traina thought interrupted.
11450860	11454940	The egg strikes again. I can't have tapioca because they sometimes,
11455500	11462540	yeah, they sometimes coat it in egg white to make it like slimy-er, kind of.
11464460	11475500	So I can only either get the jelly or, or nothing.
11478060	11482940	Eggs, eggs are surprisingly in everything or in a lot of things. You never, you'd never really
11482940	11488300	expect some eggs will be in something and then, uh, my lifetime will tell you, yeah,
11488300	11493820	sometimes they do. I have to double check.
11498620	11503100	I just realized you can't have a lot of fried chicken. Yeah, I can't have fried
11503100	11505020	chickens, certain fried chickens. Yeah.
11509580	11515340	You think you're destined to have an et tu brutus? Et tu brutus? Moment with et tu
11515420	11522220	psempai? I don't want to be betrayed by psempai. You take that back. You take those words back.
11524060	11528940	You take those words back right now. Psempai, you're never going to betray me, right?
11528940	11535580	It depends on how you get stabbed.
11550940	11555660	Probably why go high as past issues we were brutus in the past life. I can't
11558940	11569420	never. We are your mark, Anthony. No. Don't betray me. Oh, anyways, psempai,
11571660	11577660	psempai, I have to go now. No, seriously, I have to go now. My rash is flaring up
11577660	11583100	right now and I'm going to have to ice it. So I'm going to leave you here right now.
11583100	11587180	I'm going to see if anyone's online to send you there. Thank you so much for showing you,
11587660	11594380	showing me such kindness on my first monetization stream. I'm so, so, so happy and I'm so thankful
11594380	11598940	for the generosity. So I have to go. This is acting up right now.

11625980	11639660	Okay. Thank you, everyone. And tomorrow is a diff- I am doing a collab. It will be
