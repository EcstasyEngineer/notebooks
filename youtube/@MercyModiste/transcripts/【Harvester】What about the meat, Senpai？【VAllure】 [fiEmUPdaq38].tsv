330000	350000	Oops, let me turn this off.
350000	354000	My music off.
354000	357000	Senpais!
357000	362000	Don't spoil the game!
362000	367000	Oh shit, you can see my steam library, fuck.
367000	382000	Ahhhh.
382000	388000	Give us a second.
388000	391000	Why aren't you doing DOS?
391000	398000	Why aren't you doing the DOS box?
398000	403000	There it is.
403000	406000	Let's make this a little bit smaller.
406000	411000	I set you up to be
411000	413000	1920 by 1080.
413000	420000	You stupid game.
420000	422000	You stupid game.
422000	424000	It's okay.
424000	436000	Welcome Senpais to the stream!
436000	439000	I've literally, literally
439000	442000	set this up so hard.
442000	444000	I've saved it.
444000	447000	I went into the like configuration settings,
447000	449000	changed everything,
449000	454000	and it's still being a little whole.
454000	457000	Anyways, for those who don't know
457000	460000	anything about Harvest Starter,
460000	467000	it is a game made basically as a
467000	471000	protest against censorship.
471000	474000	So what you're going to see is, of course,
474000	478000	a lot of maybe edgier stuff.
478000	490000	You might see me canceled in like a day or two, who knows.
490000	501000	It's very famous for being quite out there.
501000	503000	I still hear the background.
503000	504000	Oh shit.
504000	509000	I was so caught up on seeing,
509000	514000	on making this work that I didn't realize.
514000	517000	There you go.
517000	519000	Wrong one.
519000	521000	Wrong one.
521000	523000	There we go.
530000	532000	You just missed a little bit of the opening.
532000	534000	We can watch it again.
534000	536000	Just kidding.
548000	551000	So this is the hatred of past generations.
551000	554000	There's a lot of games and movies
554000	557000	and even animes back in the 90s
557000	562000	that were protest against censorship.
562000	565000	A famous one, a famous anime,
565000	568000	that some of my senpais might know,
568000	570000	it's called General Cyber,
570000	572000	which is, which dubs itself
572000	576000	as the most violent anime ever made.
576000	583000	It's also a protest against censorship as well.
583000	585000	So make sure.
585000	590000	So games of this time,
590000	592000	the censorship was, of course,
592000	597000	due to the...
597000	603000	I think basically the scare where every...
603000	607000	Oh gosh, it's been a while since I did this study.
607000	610000	But at this point, it'll be games that are evil
610000	614000	and makes your kids satanists
614000	618000	and makes your kids all bad and stuff.
618000	623000	And so here, you can just say moral panic.
623000	625000	Mercy, thank you.
625000	630000	Everyone is up in arms about video games.
630000	633000	So what do they do?
633000	635000	They go,
635000	638000	what if we can make it worse?
646000	648000	What if we can make it worse?
651000	655000	So here we are with Arvester.
660000	663000	Oh come on, there we go.
663000	669000	Actually, let me move my screen a little bit for me.
669000	677000	I've set you up to be like the perfect ratio,
677000	679000	and now it's still windowed.
679000	681000	Can you believe it?
685000	688000	So pretty much,
688000	692000	I think this was the time when people saw...
692000	695000	I need to remember, mind you,
695000	700000	I did this study a couple, a few years ago.
700000	704000	So this was a long time ago, so my memory is still shot.
704000	710000	But this is probably like...
710000	713000	Was it Nightcrawler?
713000	718000	Nightcrawler, kind of like scare moral panic there.
718000	721000	Where, you know, Nightcrawler is like a bunch of creeper,
721000	725000	like ninja things.
725000	727000	Night trap, yes.
727000	729000	Not Nightcrawler.
729000	731000	Yeah, Nighttrap, where a bunch of ninja things
731000	736000	are coming in for these girls' sleepovers.
736000	740000	Did you tweet you are alive?
740000	742000	No?
742000	745000	I guess I'll go do that now, Senpai.
752000	755000	I guess I'll do that now, Senpai.
762000	765000	I can't believe.
765000	768000	I always forget.
768000	773000	I think I'm still in the mindset of...
777000	781000	Hold on, I need to get the...
781000	782000	What do you call it?
782000	785000	The thumbnail, and then I gotta...
785000	787000	And then I'll post it up.
787000	789000	I have to go to the waiting room and everything.
789000	792000	Not the waiting room, the stream.
792000	793000	And post it up too.
793000	797000	Oh boy, I reminded myself earlier, I'll do it.
797000	800000	And then I got distracted by pretzels.
800000	805000	I got distracted by chocolate-covered pretzels.
805000	809000	So I ate a few.
809000	812000	And a piece of cheese.
827000	837000	Okay, give me a second.
837000	840000	Sorry, Senpais.
840000	845000	I think I'm still not quite used to being...
845000	850000	Being, you know, here.
853000	856000	Let's go to my YouTube studio.
858000	861000	Content.
861000	863000	And let's do...
863000	866000	Get a shareable link.
866000	869000	Post it right there.
872000	875000	Remove the HTTPS.
878000	880000	Right here.
883000	886000	Am I on the right account? Check.
888000	891000	Oh.
891000	894000	Somebody posted tag me and something, gotta retweet it.
894000	897000	We'll reply to it later.
897000	900000	There we go!
900000	903000	Yay!
907000	909000	I always forget.
909000	912000	I always forget, because...
912000	918000	I don't want to go much into my past life.
918000	923000	Because I want to keep my past life on the down low.
923000	927000	But...
927000	930000	You know, back then I never really made a schedule and just went,
930000	932000	I want to play!
932000	935000	I want to play this! Let's go! Bam!
943000	947000	But yeah, I prefer to keep my past life on the down low,
947000	950000	but since we're allowed in VLOR, just by the way,
950000	954000	we are allowed to talk about our past life in VLOR.
954000	957000	I just want to keep it on the DL,
957000	961000	because, essentially...
961000	964000	Essentially, we are different people.
965000	970000	Now I have to schedule entire weeks beforehand.
970000	972000	Yeah.
976000	979000	Hi, Mercy. What's being harvested?
979000	982000	I'm not sure.
991000	995000	But right now, I'm bringing it up just to tell you why.
1000000	1005000	To tell you why, I haven't exactly gotten used to...
1005000	1009000	used to pulsing up that I'm live or anything.
1019000	1022000	It's like...
1026000	1030000	What? What? What do you mean, Mercy?
1030000	1033000	Why are you saying Mercy?
1033000	1035000	SEMPAI!
1035000	1037000	Speak!
1039000	1041000	Okay.
1041000	1043000	Let's show tips.
1043000	1046000	Use the right mouse button to attack an opponent.
1046000	1048000	Okay.
1048000	1053000	Left click on your character or press I to view inventory.
1054000	1057000	Left click on an object to grab it,
1057000	1060000	and right click to put it in inventory.
1060000	1063000	A penny saved is hardly worth the effort.
1063000	1067000	Use the left mouse button to move your character around the screen.
1067000	1071000	If you're stuck on a puzzle, talk to other characters,
1071000	1073000	and they will give you clues.
1073000	1076000	Avoid cliches like the plague.
1076000	1079000	Ammunition is precious, so don't waste it.
1079000	1084000	If you get stuck in a puzzle, try using items in crazy, illogical ways.
1091000	1094000	Okay, yeah, that's... that's part...
1094000	1096000	That's part of the...
1096000	1099000	That's part of point and click, so let's be real.
1104000	1106000	Save your game often,
1106000	1110000	especially before trying something crazy, illogical, or dangerous.
1112000	1117000	Holding down the control button plus the arrow keys allow you to attack opponents.
1118000	1120000	Look before you leap.
1120000	1125000	The help screen can be helpful, or better yet, read the manual.
1125000	1128000	Speaking of, I haven't read the manual.
1131000	1134000	It's a point and click with combat, it seems.
1135000	1139000	You can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose,
1139000	1141000	but you can't pick your friend's nose.
1141000	1143000	Oh yeah, bet!
1149000	1152000	This has a manual. Yeah, it looks like it has a manual.
1152000	1154000	I can pull it up, probably.
1156000	1159000	I'd have to... have to pull it up, though.
1159000	1162000	I'd have to... have to pull it up, though.
1168000	1172000	Right clicking on objects in inventory shows a close-up of that object.
1173000	1177000	Right clicking on weapons in inventory activates and deactivates them.
1177000	1180000	Press escape to bring up menu options.
1180000	1185000	You can combine objects into new objects by clicking and dragging items on one another.
1185000	1188000	Sound levels can be adjusted in the options menu.
1188000	1192000	Screen too dark, try adjusting the gamma on the option menu.
1193000	1195000	Check your photo on the inventory screen.
1195000	1198000	It will get worse as you take more damage.
1200000	1203000	Look for special items that will restore your health.
1203000	1210000	After finding required items during the day, night will be the time of mischievous adventure.
1210000	1215000	Double-click the left mouse button on an exit to go through instantly.
1215000	1218000	Use the right mouse button to attack an opponent.
1218000	1222000	Oh wait, okay, whatever, we're going back in circles now.
1222000	1223000	Thank you!
1223000	1225000	Let's look around!
1226000	1230000	A pair of plastic binoculars with lenses melted onto the table.
1230000	1231000	How hot is it?
1233000	1235000	An empty acne medication container.
1235000	1237000	Ah, we're teens.
1239000	1243000	A photo of a beautiful girl blonde about 17 years old.
1244000	1246000	A sexy pinup.
1247000	1250000	I can't, I can't whistle.
1273000	1275000	Psst!
1287000	1288000	Never mind.
1294000	1296000	One of your typical wall clocks.
1296000	1299000	I've never seen a wall clock like that ever!
1304000	1309000	Paper doll by the mill's brother sits on the turntable.
1309000	1313000	You know, like, record players are really popular.
1313000	1316000	Senpai, do you have a record player?
1318000	1321000	The dresser drawer is unlocked.
1321000	1323000	Open it then!
1324000	1329000	I take a 25 cent piece dated 1952.
1329000	1330000	Take it.
1331000	1335000	Chew marks are visible on the end of this ballpoint pen.
1335000	1336000	Take it.
1336000	1339000	As of yet, the future isn't so bright.
1339000	1340000	Can I take it?
1340000	1342000	Is there anything else in here?
1346000	1347000	We're good.
1348000	1351000	About any other drawers?
1351000	1353000	Oh no, it's just the one drawer.
1353000	1354000	Okay.
1355000	1359000	You peer through a thin layer of dust at your reflection.
1360000	1363000	Seven flannel shirts accompanied with matching blue jeans
1363000	1365000	are hanging neatly in the closet.
1371000	1373000	I have records, but no record player.
1373000	1375000	I got a tape player.
1375000	1377000	I have a tape player too!
1380000	1384000	It's like a tape player and radio.
1384000	1386000	I found it, I found it in the shed.
1390000	1392000	I found it in the shed.
1392000	1393000	It's Bugs Bunny.
1395000	1397000	It's got Bugs Bunny on it.
1398000	1401000	Actually, remember getting this tape player.
1403000	1404000	Okay, here.
1404000	1405000	Let's walk, mister.
1405000	1407000	Oh, what's in the trash can?
1407000	1410000	An empty trash can, so clean you can eat from it.
1414000	1415000	Anything else?
1415000	1417000	Did this require anything?
1417000	1419000	Oh, maybe the drawer?
1419000	1420000	No.
1421000	1424000	The mattress is speckled with odd stains.
1426000	1431000	A 148 scale P47 Thunderbolt with a broken propeller.
1431000	1432000	How about this one?
1432000	1438000	A hastily glued P51 Mustang in exactly a 136 scale.
1438000	1439000	Oh, oh no!
1439000	1441000	Oh no, Senpai!
1441000	1443000	Oh no, Senpai!
1443000	1444000	Oh no!
1444000	1449000	I'm gonna have to BRB real fast.
1449000	1453000	I think I have an idle meeting.

2191000	2211320	I did wash my hands, yes I did.
2211320	2218560	You want to watch me game or what?
2218560	2219560	Did Marcy pull an Emmy?
2219560	2220560	What the Emmy pull?
2220560	2221560	Your finger?
2221560	2246560	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2246560	2256560	I haven't even told about the mom yet?
2256560	2259560	Who's mom?
2259560	2283560	I'm gonna save the game just in case I step out of this room and then I decide to die.
2283560	2305560	Oh my gosh, a box of crayons and a range rider coloring book.
2305560	2310560	What's this?
2310560	2314560	Fine bone china gleams from the mahogany shelves.
2314560	2317560	Can I look at the crack in the ceiling?
2317560	2319560	Why is there so many?
2319560	2324560	Okay, first off, why is there two fire extinguishers?
2324560	2326560	A box full of newspapers.
2326560	2331560	That's a lot of newspapers.
2331560	2336560	The stunning depiction of the earth made of paper mache.
2336560	2344560	Not even plastic, okay.
2344560	2347560	This house is very safety conscious.
2347560	2353560	Everything was flammable, okay.
2353560	2357560	What?
2357560	2360560	What?
2360560	2362560	Who are you?
2362560	2367560	You wouldn't.
2367560	2372560	Mom.
2372560	2374560	Do you know me?
2374560	2386560	Do you know me?
2386560	2397560	I am a shit brother.
2397560	2402560	Mom, Steve is bugging me.
2402560	2404560	Okay.
2404560	2410560	Yo, lousy rat.
2410560	2414560	Listen here, you little shit.
2414560	2423560	I'm actually the youngest sibling, so I was the little shit.
2423560	2434560	Steve.
2434560	2442560	Wow, we have such a short temper.
2442560	2445560	You always wear a kidder, Steve.
2445560	2449560	I'm sick.
2449560	2457560	Uh, tell me about your cowboy show.
2457560	2462560	On TV?
2462560	2469560	You think?
2469560	2475560	Yeah, I think so too.
2475560	2482560	Blood and guts are needle.
2482560	2485560	What should I say, Senpai?
2485560	2490560	Should I be the half full big brother?
2490560	2494560	Or should I just be like, yeah, you're right.
2494560	2498560	That's really neat.
2498560	2504560	You're not too bad for a lousy rat.
2504560	2509560	It's like they're talking about any.
2509560	2522560	I said any like a belly button.
2522560	2523560	Sick.
2523560	2526560	What's wrong with you?
2526560	2538560	I'm gonna watch my cowboy show.
2538560	2541560	So shut up.
2541560	2550560	Shut up.
2550560	2563560	Magnesia stuff.
2563560	2567560	I don't understand.
2567560	2573560	Okay kid, you're being a lot of stuff.
2573560	2580560	You're saying you're doing a lot of foreshadowing here.
2580560	2588560	That I don't know what you're foreshadowing.
2588560	2593560	Mercy, don't look up any of the names in this game.
2593560	2603560	Like Steve?
2603560	2605560	Don't worry.
2605560	2608560	You want creepy child mode?
2608560	2612560	You have to sing lullapies very quietly.
2612560	2624560	Have you noticed that your show...
2624560	2625560	Oh wait.
2625560	2629560	I already picked that one.
2629560	2632560	Alright, it's really neat.
2632560	2634560	What's this other?
2634560	2636560	Well, I can type stuff.
2636560	2638560	Stinky.
2638560	2641560	Say what?
2642560	2645560	You're adopted.
2645560	2651560	Say what?
2651560	2655560	Ring around the rosy.
2655560	2657560	You know like...
2657560	2661560	Rock-a-bye baby on a tree top.
2661560	2665560	When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.
2665560	2669560	When the bow breaks, the cradle will fall.
2669560	2682560	And down will come baby, cradle and all.
2682560	2685560	Is that creepy for you guys?
2685560	2695560	This baby freaking fell from a tree.
2695560	2696560	No?
2696560	2705560	It's not creepy.
2705560	2714560	I guess like another one you think about it.
2714560	2720560	You singing it didn't sound creepy.
2720560	2723560	Mary, Mary, oh contrary.
2723560	2725560	How does your garden grow?
2725560	2728560	Have cockroach shells?
2728560	2733560	And I forgot was...
2733560	2735560	What's the other flower?
2735560	2738560	Something rhymes with bells.
2738560	2747560	And pretty maids all laid in a row.
2747560	2754560	Wait, did we ask about daddy yet?
2754560	2756560	Your dad is asleep?
2756560	2759560	He and mom went at it last night pretty hard.
2759560	2760560	Wait what?
2760560	2761560	He stayed in bed.
2761560	2763560	I saw what she did to him.
2763560	2764560	It was pretty bad.
2764560	2765560	What did she...
2765560	2766560	What is she?
2766560	2767560	Like you don't know.
2767560	2770560	I saw you and her on the couch last Wednesday night.
2770560	2773560	Guess that's why she's grounded now, huh?
2773560	2777560	Too bad you wouldn't pay me and I had to tell, huh?
2777560	2778560	What are you talking about?
2778560	2779560	What girl?
2779560	2780560	What?
2780560	2781560	Is there another one too?
2781560	2785560	Wait till I tell.
2785560	2794560	Ezra!
2794560	2804560	Welcome to the stream!
2804560	2806560	Welcome Raiders!
2806560	2810560	Welcome to the stream!
2810560	2812560	Sorry, did I miss that?
2812560	2813560	But did we just...
2813560	2815560	You know, did we just f*** our mom?
2815560	2823560	Or did we f*** someone else?
2823560	2833560	Ask, ask what?
2833560	2843560	I have to ask?
2843560	2846560	No wait, he said something about the couch.
2846560	2853560	Like I saw you and mom on the couch and I'm like...
2853560	2856560	Okay fine, I'll ask it right there.
2856560	2859560	Oh Ezra, you're making me blush.
2859560	2864560	Oh you're such a kidder.
2864560	2868560	You're making me blush, Ezra.
2868560	2870560	Now he just said her.
2870560	2871560	Her, her.
2871560	2872560	Okay, her is girl.
2872560	2873560	Okay, let me check.
2873560	2874560	Girl.
2874560	2875560	Girl.
2875560	2877560	I don't know what girl you're talking about.
2877560	2879560	All summer, it's been Stephanie this.
2879560	2880560	Stephanie that.
2880560	2882560	And now you don't remember?
2882560	2884560	You think I'm dumb or something?
2884560	2887560	No, I just can't remember anything like I said.
2887560	2889560	Well you better remember quit.
2889560	2891560	Cause the wedding's in two weeks.
2891560	2892560	What?
2892560	2896560	Leave me alone so I can watch TV.
2896560	2897560	TV?
2897560	2899560	That's a weird looking television.
2899560	2901560	Come to think of it, this whole place looks totally retro.
2901560	2903560	What do you mean retro?
2903560	2905560	All TVs look alike.
2905560	2906560	Sure, basically.
2906560	2907560	You didn't say mom.
2907560	2909560	This whole fashion clunker.
2909560	2910560	Whole fashion?
2910560	2912560	Looks brand new.
2912560	2914560	Yeah, but look at the tube.
2914560	2915560	Where's the remote control?
2915560	2916560	Where's the tube?
2916560	2918560	What's that?
2918560	2919560	What's that?
2919560	2921560	No but I think about it.
2921560	2922560	I can't remember.
2922560	2924560	And what was that you said?
2924560	2926560	I thought retro rockets?
2926560	2929560	No, retro, it means...
2929560	2931560	It means...
2931560	2933560	Oh man, I know what I mean.
2933560	2935560	That everything here is wrong.
2935560	2937560	But I can't picture the difference.
2937560	2939560	And shut up and quit bugging me.
2939560	2943560	I'm lost in my cowboy show.
2943560	2945560	What wedding?
2945560	2946560	Wait, hold on.
2946560	2947560	What wedding?
2947560	2948560	First off.
2948560	2949560	What else?
2949560	2951560	Well, I...
2954560	2955560	Yeah, you're right.
2955560	2956560	It's great.
2956560	2957560	Okay, shut up.
2957560	2959560	What wedding?
2959560	2962560	Say what?
2962560	2965560	Pick your nose.
2965560	2967560	I saw the nose wrong.
2967560	2968560	No.
2968560	2972560	Say what?
2972560	2973560	Boop.
2973560	2977560	Say what?
2977560	2979560	Adopt it.
2979560	2981560	Adopt it.
2981560	2982560	Say what?
2982560	2985560	You're adopted, kid.
2985560	2988560	Try Stephanie.
2988560	2991560	Stephanie.
2991560	2992560	Say what?
2992560	2994560	Oh fuck this kid.
2994560	2995560	Good.
2995560	2997560	Finally.
2997560	3001560	Wait till I get my grabby little hands on you.
3001560	3003560	We're at...
3010560	3012560	Good.
3013560	3016560	Let me alone, Claudia.
3016560	3018560	This is the good part.
3018560	3020560	I see.
3020560	3023560	Uh, was it Stephanie Girl?
3023560	3025560	I don't know what girl you're talking about.
3025560	3026560	Thank you.
3026560	3029560	All summer, it's been Stephanie this and Stephanie that.
3029560	3031560	And now you don't remember?
3031560	3033560	You think I'm dumb or something?
3033560	3036560	No, I just can't remember anything, like I said.
3036560	3038560	Well, you better remember quit.
3038560	3040560	Because the wedding's in two weeks.
3040560	3041560	What?
3041560	3044560	Let me alone so I can watch TV.
3044560	3045560	Stephanie.
3045560	3049560	I said I don't want to talk about her anymore.
3049560	3053560	I said...
3053560	3055560	All right.
3055560	3056560	See ya.
3056560	3057560	Good.
3057560	3060560	Man, what a bratty brother I have.
3060560	3062560	Just spank him.
3062560	3065560	Is that mom?
3065560	3066560	What's this?
3066560	3070560	An expertly embroidered old fashioned wall plaque.
3072560	3075560	Cookies are baking in the oven.
3080560	3083560	A newborn is sleeping soundly.
3083560	3086560	A cabinet that smells of dirty diapers.
3086560	3088560	Dirty diapers?
3088560	3090560	Shouldn't they be clean?
3092560	3096560	Have you tried putting the entire English dictionary into the chat box
3096560	3098560	and tried to trigger everything at once?
3098560	3101560	I don't think so.
3101560	3104560	These cookies are hot out of the oven.
3104560	3105560	All right.
3114560	3116560	Oh, there is.
3128560	3130560	Uh-huh.
3132560	3134560	Oh, he says Josh.
3139560	3141560	What job?
3143560	3146560	We've already established this, Steve.
3154560	3156560	I'm going to fall asleep to Marysie.
3156560	3159560	You may fall asleep to me.
3159560	3160560	Hold on.
3160560	3161560	Mwah.
3161560	3163560	Now, tuck you in.
3163560	3165560	Here you go.
3165560	3166560	I have a sister?
3166560	3167560	Oh, wait.
3167560	3170560	Is it the baby?
3170560	3172560	The baby?
3172560	3174560	The baby.
3174560	3175560	OK.
3175560	3176560	Let's go through all this.
3176560	3178560	Graduation.
3178560	3181560	When did we graduate?
3181560	3183560	Four months ago.
3186560	3188560	All you need to get a job.
3188560	3192560	And besides, you can't marry Stephanie if you're going to waste your time going to college.
3192560	3195560	This is the first time I've ever seen someone say,
3195560	3197560	don't go to college.
3197560	3199560	It's a disgrace, but better late than never.
3199560	3202560	I guess we can thank Stephanie for that.
3204560	3206560	All right.
3206560	3208560	This is the first.
3210560	3212560	All right, Stephanie.
3213560	3215560	And just who is Stephanie?
3215560	3218560	Don't you dare toy with that sweet girl.
3218560	3221560	If you start in on her with all this amnesia poop,
3221560	3225560	she'll think her fiance is having second thoughts about the wedding.
3226560	3228560	Wedding?
3228560	3230560	Look, all this talk about weddings is nuts.
3230560	3233560	I'm not marrying anybody till I figure out what's going on here.
3233560	3235560	First, the heartbreak of psoriasis.
3235560	3237560	Psoriasis?
3237560	3240560	Two weeks before the wedding and you're backing out.
3240560	3242560	Whatever will the neighbors think?
3242560	3244560	I can't marry someone I don't even know.
3244560	3247560	Fine, have it your way, but leave me out of it.
3247560	3249560	If you're going to break Stephanie's heart,
3249560	3251560	you march right next door and do it yourself.
3251560	3254560	And don't expect me to write you a note.
3255560	3256560	Okay.
3256560	3257560	Fiance?
3257560	3258560	Fiance?
3258560	3259560	Fiance?
3259560	3260560	This is insane.
3260560	3263560	Oh, you're not having second thoughts about marrying Stephanie.
3263560	3266560	Is that what this silliness is all about?
3266560	3267560	Pre-wedding jitters?
3267560	3269560	Can something like that produce amnesia?
3270560	3274560	Stop this foolishness right now and count your blessings.
3274560	3277560	Stephanie is great at cooking and cleaning.
3278560	3279560	Cooking and cleaning?
3279560	3282560	What's cooking and cleaning got to do with anything?
3282560	3285560	Honestly, boys are so dense.
3285560	3288560	What else is there for a wife but cooking and cleaning?
3288560	3291560	You may not appreciate a hot meal on a clean plate when it's there,
3291560	3295560	but if it wasn't, we'd hear about it soon enough, I'll bet.
3295560	3297560	You're saying that's all there is to marriage.
3297560	3298560	Cooking and cleaning?
3298560	3299560	No!
3299560	3301560	You'll have to ask your father about that,
3301560	3304560	but I'm sure Stephanie will do her duty.
3304560	3305560	Her duty?
3307560	3309560	Don't worry so far.
3309560	3312560	I'll do my duty too when we get married.
3319560	3323560	Marriage is more than cooking and cleaning.
3324560	3327560	It's about loving each other
3327560	3331560	and being there for each other for all of eternity.
3331560	3332560	Right?
3338560	3339560	I said right!
3344560	3345560	Okay.
3348560	3349560	Good!
3349560	3351560	So fly, good!
3353560	3355560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
3356560	3358560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
3365560	3366560	Ha!
3374560	3376560	Someone say no?
3379560	3382560	Mom, scut off his testicles!
3383560	3384560	Are there testicles?
3384560	3385560	I don't actually know.
3389560	3390560	Thank you!
3391560	3392560	Thank you, mods!
3410560	3411560	You're welcome.
3412560	3415560	You'll have them back once Emmy wakes up.
3430560	3432560	Okay, let's talk about our duty.
3432560	3434560	Or should we talk about our father?
3434560	3435560	Ha ha, duty.
3438560	3439560	They grow back?
3439560	3441560	They always grow back, don't you know?
3449560	3451560	We should talk about duty, huh?
3456560	3457560	Disgusting truths.
3464560	3465560	Lexingogos?
3469560	3470560	Your baby was Stephanie.
3470560	3472560	You'll have to make your peace with the fact that
3472560	3474560	when a farmer plants his seed,
3474560	3477560	he can't help but get some nasty dirt on his hoe.
3477560	3479560	Not on his hoe!
3490560	3491560	Mother!
3492560	3495560	You can't use such language around here.
3496560	3500560	We should treasure the love they have.
3501560	3503560	Or maybe if there's no love.
3503560	3504560	You know what?
3504560	3506560	If there's no love, no marriage, okay?
3506560	3509560	But clearly, there has to be love.
3509560	3511560	Oh, why goggles?
3514560	3516560	Goggles is such a strange thing.
3516560	3518560	You know, like, goggle boots, right?
3518560	3520560	Like, they're really long boots.
3521560	3524560	Oh, let's talk about our father now.
3528560	3529560	My father.
3529560	3531560	He's in the other room.
3531560	3533560	He decided to sleep in today.
3533560	3536560	Now please, let me get back to my cookies.
3536560	3537560	Cookies?
3537560	3539560	The bake sale was on Friday,
3539560	3542560	and yet you're baking the cookies now.
3542560	3545560	Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
3545560	3547560	But they'll be stale by then.
3547560	3549560	That's why I'm throwing them away.
3549560	3551560	And then cooking more?
3551560	3553560	To replace the ones I throw out.
3553560	3554560	Why?
3554560	3555560	Well, I have to.
3555560	3559560	No one's going to pay to eat stale cookies out of the garbage can.
3559560	3561560	But you expect me to?
3561560	3563560	Of course not, Steve.
3563560	3564560	I wouldn't charge you.
3564560	3565560	I'm your mother.
3565560	3566560	Help yourself.
3571560	3575560	You would charge me to eat cookies out of the trash can?
3575560	3578560	You wouldn't have done that, mommy?
3578560	3579560	All right.
3579560	3582560	Let's get some garbage cookies.
3582560	3585560	What charity is this bake sale supposed to benefit?
3585560	3589560	It'll help provide a fund for bums and hobos who wander into harvest
3589560	3591560	and have no family ties.
3591560	3593560	Kind of a specific target group, isn't it?
3593560	3596560	Yeah, that's pretty specific to detail when dealing with such people.
3596560	3598560	I don't know what you mean.
3598560	3599560	You will.
3599560	3602560	The whole thing has been organized by the lodge.
3602560	3603560	The lodge?
3603560	3605560	The lodge?
3622560	3624560	What lodge?
3633560	3635560	What's so great about it?
3635560	3637560	It sounds like a call.
3637560	3642560	No one gets inside, but it wouldn't be so exclusive if it wasn't just wonderful.
3642560	3647560	Just like the new Reynolds dishwasher with their patented auto dry process TM.
3647560	3650560	I've never used one, but I know I want it.
3650560	3653560	Instead of sulking around the house all day,
3653560	3656560	why not walk over to the lodge and apply for membership?
3660560	3662560	The last thing I want is a fizz on my head.
3662560	3664560	Don't be so hasty, Steve.
3664560	3668560	I think you'll find harvest is a pretty dull place without the lodge.
3668560	3670560	You sound like the membership director.
3670560	3671560	Don't be silly.
3671560	3673560	I just want what's best for you.
3673560	3675560	That's all.
3675560	3678560	Harvest, harvest.
3678560	3682560	I don't remember the song.
3682560	3684560	Nice product placement, though.
3684560	3690560	I think my dishwasher is over 20 years old.
3694560	3704560	Harvest is a town unlike any you've ever known.
3704560	3705560	In what way?
3705560	3706560	Yeah.
3706560	3707560	I don't have time to go into it now.
3707560	3710560	Why not take a walk around town and pester someone else?
3710560	3712560	I'm busy.
3716560	3717560	Okay, bye, mom.
3717560	3719560	Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.
3719560	3721560	You know how he gets.
3721560	3723560	Wait, we put the papers out for Jimmy?
3724560	3726560	Freshly baked cookies are in the trash can.
3726560	3729560	Can I take a look at them?
3737560	3739560	Well, I guess I'll grab.
3744560	3746560	Yeah, it's there.
3748560	3749560	House indicator.
3749560	3750560	I'm fine.
3750560	3752560	Harvest land, furniture, warehouse.
3752560	3753560	Okay.
3755560	3758560	The master bedroom door is firmly locked.
3763560	3765560	Is that my father?
3768560	3770560	I could have taken a look at the baby.
3770560	3772560	I can newborn baby is sleeping soundly.
3772560	3774560	He's eating.
3774560	3776560	Now he doesn't sound healthy.
3776560	3779560	Sounds like one of my, my senpai's dad.
3779560	3781560	Oh boy.
3781560	3786560	Now I'm squealing wickedly in the kitchen's antiseptic glow.
3786560	3788560	Mom.
3788560	3790560	I told you I'm busy, Steve.
3790560	3792560	Why don't you talk to him?
3792560	3793560	I'm busy.
3793560	3794560	I'm busy.
3794560	3795560	I'm busy.
3795560	3796560	I'm busy.
3796560	3797560	I'm busy.
3797560	3798560	I'm busy.
3798560	3799560	I'm busy.
3799560	3800560	I'm busy.
3800560	3802560	Steve, why don't you talk to Hank
3802560	3804560	or go next door and visit Stephanie
3804560	3807560	or go get an early start on your new job.
3809560	3810560	Hank?
3810560	3811560	Hank.
3811560	3812560	That kid over by the television?
3812560	3814560	Your little brother is home sick from school today
3814560	3817560	and I won't have you scaring him with this amnesia poop.
3817560	3819560	Is he really sick?
3819560	3821560	Look at the show he's watching.
3821560	3823560	Wouldn't you say he's sick?
3823560	3825560	I'd make him stop, but oh, I'm so busy
3825560	3828560	baking cookies for the Harvest PPA charity bake sale.
3828560	3830560	It's on Friday, you know.
3830560	3832560	I hope you're still planning on going.
3832560	3833560	I don't know.
3833560	3834560	I need to think.
3834560	3837560	Honestly, skipping out of a charity affair.
3837560	3838560	What's gotten into you?
3838560	3839560	I don't know.
3839560	3840560	Damn it.
3840560	3841560	That's what I'm telling you.
3841560	3844560	Don't you dare use that language around me.
3844560	3845560	Oh, my goodness.
3845560	3847560	Your father didn't hear you or Stephanie
3847560	3848560	for that matter.
3848560	3852560	How do you think she'd feel knowing her fiance was a gutter mess?
3852560	3861560	Wait, did I talk about my father yet?
3861560	3864560	Didn't I foul a language?
3864560	3866560	Shit.
3866560	3870560	Stop speaking nonsense, dear.
3870560	3872560	Bitch.
3872560	3879560	Stop speaking nonsense, dear.
3879560	3880560	Fuck.
3880560	3883560	What a thing to say to your mother.
3883560	3886560	Was that an invitation now that your father is out of action?
3911560	3916560	I'm flabbergasted.
3916560	3919560	I'm flabbergasted.
3919560	3921560	I guess we got to pick the first one.
3921560	3925560	We got to pick the first one.
3925560	3930560	I guess we have to pick the first one.
3930560	3933560	I mean, everyone has as around the line, right?
3940560	3942560	Well, we're here.
3942560	3943560	Let's go.
3943560	3947560	Yeah, how about it, mommy?
3947560	3949560	Maybe later, dear.
3949560	3951560	Right now I have housework to do.
3951560	3953560	So you can watch if you want.
3953560	3955560	Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.
3955560	3957560	You know how he gets.
3971560	3977560	My mouth is a gait.
3977560	3988560	She said maybe later.
3988560	3997560	We got a maybe?
3997560	4002560	There's a glow from behind the cabinet.
4002560	4009560	Can I punch my bro?
4009560	4012560	What do I do if I say fuck to him?
4012560	4015560	No, nothing, OK.
4015560	4018560	Bye.
4018560	4020560	Why is there a glow there?
4020560	4023560	Can I?
4023560	4029560	Come on, walk.
4029560	4033560	What's that glow?
4033560	4039560	Can I push it?
4039560	4042560	Remember to say before you do anything crazy,
4042560	4045560	I got the paper.
4045560	4052560	Right here, I have the paper.
4052560	4062560	What happened?
4062560	4081560	What is this?
4081560	4083560	What a bag!
4083560	4086560	What a bag in the inventory!
4086560	4097560	Oh no, is this the paper?
4097560	4103560	What did I do, Aya?
4103560	4118560	Aya!
4118560	4121560	Tempai!
4121560	4126560	It's stuck!
4126560	4129560	It's stuck!
4129560	4131560	Can you hear that?
4131560	4141560	It's making the t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t sound.
4141560	4143560	Now everything's frozen!
4143560	4146560	Aya!
4146560	4154560	Aya!
4154560	4161560	Aya, Tempai!
4161560	4164560	Don't look, Tempai!
4164560	4166560	Don't look at my...
4166560	4168560	No, that's not it.
4168560	4177560	Don't look at my steam.
4177560	4189560	Don't look at my steam.
4189560	4204560	Oh now it decides to play in fullscreen stupid game.
4204560	4207560	Never mind, I decided not to go in fullscreen anymore.
4207560	4210560	Hello?
4210560	4217560	Hello?
4217560	4223560	Are you gonna...
4223560	4225560	Are you gonna show up?
4225560	4237560	Okay, there we go. We're fine now.
4237560	4248560	Can I skip?
4248560	4256560	Wait, no, I have a save file. Load game.
4256560	4268560	Or okay.
4268560	4273560	Guess we should save more often.
4273560	4283560	Okay, let's skip through this.
4283560	4288560	Eddie.
4288560	4293560	Girl.
4293560	4295560	Stephanie.
4295560	4299560	Phoebe.
4299560	4304560	There we go.
4304560	4310560	I saved before the brother, which sucks.
4310560	4319560	Cowboy.
4319560	4323560	Oops.
4324560	4329560	Bye.
4329560	4334560	Bye.
4334560	4338560	Guess we go talk to mom now.
4338560	4346560	At least we can speedrun him being a brat, yeah.
4347560	4359560	Talk to mom.
4359560	4364560	Okay.
4364560	4367560	Stephanie.
4367560	4371560	Wedding.
4371560	4376560	Beyonce.
4376560	4381560	Cooking and cleaning.
4381560	4385560	Father.
4385560	4392560	Cookies.
4392560	4396560	Uh, job. I remember it was job.
4396560	4406560	I didn't actually talk about the job. What was my job?
4406560	4411560	Just like anybody else.
4411560	4424560	Oh, my dad's work? Slaughterhouse.
4424560	4439560	Mom, your voice changed.
4439560	4447560	Uh, did we talk about lodge again?
4447560	4456560	Uh, why not? I go look into it.
4456560	4460560	Harvest.
4460560	4467560	Uh, I guess we can say, does anyone else know if we can say something else?
4467560	4484560	Cause, I don't know, I guess we can do this again.
4484560	4492560	It still shocks me each time.
4492560	4502560	Dirty diapers. Knives.
4502560	4505560	Embroidery.
4505560	4510560	Let's get out of here.
4510560	4513560	Escape save game.
4513560	4520560	Let's save it over this game file.
4520560	4531560	Let's get box one newspapers. Let's grab the newspaper.
4531560	4541560	I said grab the newspaper.
4541560	4556560	I wonder if, if, if I need to, if I, if I can check it.
4556560	4562560	Let's save again.
4562560	4570560	Let's save again to see if that newspaper breaks again.
4570560	4578560	Can I, how do I look at it? Does anyone remember how to look at it?
4578560	4592560	I guess it didn't break again.
4592560	4599560	Did I double click? I can't remember how to look at it. Right click to look at it.
4600560	4606560	Well, it's not, not doing anything.
4606560	4619560	Now, whatever.
4619560	4624560	This kid wants the paper, right?
4624560	4628560	Here you go.
4628560	4631560	No.
4631560	4635560	Hey Steve, you've been doing a swell drop putting the paper out in the morning.
4635560	4641560	You just keep doing that and we won't have any problems. That's not much to ask, is it?
4641560	4642560	No.
4642560	4644560	See you later alligator.
4644560	4646560	Okay, see you later alligator.
4646560	4652560	Full of junk, mail, bills and bake sale flyers.
4652560	4661560	Is that? There are security bars fastened to the window with Phillip head screws.
4661560	4667560	The day glow lima space disc stuck on the roof.
4667560	4673560	An Army surplus air conditioner.
4673560	4678560	Okay, this kid's acting a little hard for like, you know.
4678560	4681560	See you later alligator.
4681560	4688560	Okay, so I have to give him the paper every day.
4688560	4705560	Can I see the paper?
4705560	4710560	Your house, general store or Stephanie's house?
4710560	4714560	Oh, huh?
4714560	4721560	Potsdam's residence.
4721560	4724560	The garage needs some new paint job.
4724560	4730560	Glass is so clear the reflection makes it difficult to see.
4730560	4734560	Must have rained recently.
4734560	4739560	That window is shaped like a wagon wheel.
4739560	4743560	Hi.
4743560	4752560	The man of the house squeezing his mate.
4752560	4758560	Wait, I soft blocked myself. What do you mean?
4758560	4762560	There he is, my future son-in-law. And how's he doing today?
4762560	4767560	What brings him to the Potsdam household?
4767560	4775560	I came to see Stephanie.
4775560	4777560	Oh, you'll have to ask the missus about that.
4777560	4781560	Stephanie's grounded to the wedding.
4781560	4797560	Can't have her changing her mind at the last minute. Not with all that meat at stake.
4797560	4800560	Me?
4800560	4805560	I haven't seen my father. He's locked in a room.
4805560	4807560	He's not going to die, is he?
4807560	4813560	Like I said, I don't know. That woman, Mom, tends to him herself.
4813560	4817560	Well, next time you see him, be sure to tell him that I said hello.
4817560	4821560	And tell him that I'm praying for his speedy recovery.
4821560	4827560	And also, would you remind him about the meat? Especially about the meat?
4827560	4830560	Yeah, fine. If I see him.
4830560	4836560	You should be concerned. If he dies, then who's going to take over the slaughterhouse?
4836560	4839560	Who's going to tend to the meat?
4839560	4842560	Why is it meat?
4842560	4846560	You'd take over, right?
4846560	4847560	Slaughterhouse?
4847560	4854560	I can't imagine a better job than working in a slaughterhouse.
4854560	4858560	I think working in a slaughterhouse might be cool.
4858560	4864560	Bite your tongue with that serpent's tooth. Your dead slaughterhouse is the most successful business in harvest.
4864560	4866560	Oh, okay. Never mind. You got me angry at that.
4866560	4868560	You'll love it there.
4868560	4873560	Oh, sure. Cutting animals open may not be much fun. Reaching into their bodies...
4873560	4875560	Uh-huh.
4875560	4877560	Oh, wait. Actually, this is fine.
4877560	4883560	...testing, dangling, and slapping against you the smell of death and shit in your nostrils all the time.
4883560	4885560	That's fine.
4885560	4889560	Those are all definite cons of what you're done.
4889560	4893560	The guts have been washed into the gutters. What have you left with them?
4893560	4895560	Meat.
4895560	4898560	Rose and rose.
4898560	4903560	Did the audio go weird?
4907560	4910560	Is that supposed to happen?
4918560	4921560	Was that supposed to happen?
4923560	4936560	That was a little bit spooky. That was kind of spooky. That surprised me when that happened.
4936560	4940560	Yeah, let's talk more about the meat.
4940560	4943560	Oh.
4947560	4950560	I might have to turn the volume down if that happens again.
4951560	4954560	Meat is the foundation of any decent society.
4954560	4958560	Everyone needs at least five servings of red meat a day.
4958560	4961560	And anyone who says otherwise is a commie.
4961560	4962560	A commie?
4962560	4967560	And once you're married to Stephanie, I'll be part of the family, too.
4967560	4970560	And your father will give me all the meat I want.
4972560	4975560	Time to make some for not getting into the lodge.
4976560	4980560	It sounds so grainy.
4980560	4983560	Is that supposed to happen?
4983560	4985560	Did I break the game?
4985560	4987560	Again?
4987560	4989560	Or is it just like that?
4996560	4999560	Yeah, let's talk about the meat.
4999560	5004560	I don't like how he's talking about father's meat. Yeah, me neither.
5005560	5013560	Meat is the foundation of any decent society. Everyone needs at least three servings of red meat a day.
5013560	5016560	Alright, we already asked about that. Got it, father.
5016560	5018560	I haven't seen my father.
5018560	5020560	Like I said.
5020560	5022560	Well, next time you see him.
5022560	5023560	Yeah, fuck.
5023560	5025560	You should be more concerned.
5025560	5027560	Um...
5029560	5031560	Bye?
5032560	5035560	Also, almost made of leather.
5035560	5037560	It's polyester.
5040560	5044560	The upholster you stained after years of profuse sweating.
5046560	5050560	A futary urn in this cabinet so occupant.
5051560	5057560	A giant mutant asparagus?
5057560	5062560	Inexplicably robust given the fact that it's encased in red concrete.
5062560	5067560	Perhaps the health... healthful electromagnetic fields of harvest.
5067560	5069560	Why is it sounding like this?
5074560	5077560	Hello, Steve. Have you lost a day?
5080560	5085560	You look just like my mom except for the hair.
5093560	5097560	Honestly, you man can insult a woman without even knowing you've done it.
5097560	5100560	What a horrible thing to say.
5100560	5102560	Oh, you don't like my mom?
5102560	5105560	Same kind of dress. Same pearls.
5105560	5107560	So bizarre.
5107560	5110560	There's nothing bizarre about baking cookies.
5110560	5114560	The harvest charity bake-so is Friday, you know, and by gosh,
5114560	5118560	Mrs. Marvin Potson Jr. can be counted on to do her share.
5119560	5120560	Pearls.
5120560	5124560	Just because I'm doing housework doesn't mean I have to be a drudge.
5124560	5127560	It's a wife's duty to look good for her husband at all times.
5127560	5130560	What's wrong with wearing pearls for heaven's sake?
5130560	5133560	Nothing, but you look like June Cleaver.
5133560	5135560	Some kind of sitcom, Mom.
5135560	5137560	sitcom?
5137560	5140560	Geez, you know, a situation comedy.
5140560	5143560	The weird part is, I can't remember how I know that.
5143560	5147560	I'm much too busy with housework to watch TV.
5147560	5151560	Maybe Mr. Potson would know about sitcoms.
5151560	5152560	sitcoms?
5152560	5155560	Somebody doesn't watch TV though. She's grounded.
5155560	5157560	Why is she grounded?
5157560	5162560	Mr. Potson feels there's too much at stake to allow Stephanie to run around with.
5162560	5164560	She doesn't want to get married either, huh?
5164560	5165560	Uh-huh.
5165560	5167560	Are you saying you don't want to marry my daughter?
5167560	5170560	I don't know your daughter, Mrs. Potson.
5170560	5171560	Why is she grounded?
5171560	5174560	Afraid she'll run away before the wedding?
5174560	5175560	No.
5175560	5177560	She's as delighted as we are about the wedding.
5177560	5179560	Every bit as delighted as we are.
5179560	5182560	But she might be hit by a car or a fallen piano.
5182560	5183560	Or who knows what?
5183560	5184560	A fallen piano?
5184560	5186560	Mr. Potson wants us all to be one happy family.
5186560	5190560	And he doesn't want to risk anything happening at the last minute.
5191560	5194560	You please let her out of her room, please.
5194560	5195560	Not a chance, Steve.
5195560	5197560	Mr. Potson wouldn't like it.
5197560	5200560	If you'd like to see her, it's fine with me.
5200560	5202560	Go upstairs and turn right.
5202560	5203560	Now, excuse me.
5203560	5207560	I'm trying to get ready for the bake sale.
5207560	5209560	Mr. Potson.
5209560	5212560	You mustn't be too hard on Mr. Potson, Steve.
5212560	5214560	He's a disappointed man.
5214560	5217560	No matter how many large admission forms he fills out,
5217560	5219560	they keep turning him down.
5219560	5221560	He has a new application in, though,
5221560	5223560	so keep your fingers crossed.
5223560	5225560	If he joins the lodge,
5225560	5229560	you and Stephanie can have your wedding in the Chapel of Love
5229560	5233560	rather than over at Moynihan's place.
5233560	5235560	Mr. what?
5235560	5236560	Moynihan?
5236560	5238560	Mr. Moynihan runs the Wayward Hotel
5238560	5240560	and the Shady Oaks Funeral Parlor.
5240560	5243560	It's rumored he has connections with the lodge,
5243560	5246560	but the order keeps that kind of thing safe.
5246560	5249560	So Mr. Potson has tried to get him to put in a good word
5249560	5251560	for his lodge application?
5251560	5254560	But so far...
5254560	5256560	Lodge?
5256560	5259560	What can you tell me about the lodge?
5259560	5263560	Just that they're exclusive and secretive.
5263560	5266560	If you're curious, you ought to pick up a lodge application
5266560	5270560	at the post office and take it over to the Sergeant at Arms.
5270560	5272560	Isn't that a thought?
5273560	5275560	Isn't that a thought?
5275560	5277560	Forget Mr. Potson.
5277560	5280560	If you became a member of the order,
5280560	5283560	we could hold the wedding inside the lodge.
5283560	5287560	My, wouldn't that be lovely?
5288560	5290560	Okay.
5290560	5292560	Tell me about this wedding.
5292560	5293560	Wedding?
5293560	5295560	Well, it's set for three weeks.
5295560	5297560	We're holding it over at Shady Oaks,
5297560	5299560	Mr. Moynihan's funeral parlor.
5299560	5301560	Wedding in a funeral?
5301560	5303560	It's not a very romantic place,
5303560	5305560	but there's nowhere else to hold it.
5305560	5307560	Thanks to Mr. Potson.
5310560	5313560	You mustn't be too hard...
5313560	5316560	Give my regards to your parents.
5316560	5319560	Wait, wait, what if I say those words?
5319560	5321560	Yes, please.
5321560	5323560	She's upstairs.
5323560	5326560	What if I say fuck again?
5326560	5329560	Sorry, I didn't catch that.
5330560	5332560	Shit.
5332560	5334560	Sorry, I didn't catch that.
5334560	5336560	Is that really, is that really,
5336560	5339560	is mom the only one that responds to that?
5340560	5342560	Icebox is locked.
5342560	5345560	Our kitchen is a minty fresh looking scent.
5350560	5353560	Pushes are preventing it from opening.
5353560	5356560	A plastic plant with freshly watered soil,
5356560	5359560	and with little styrofoam balls.
5360560	5362560	Our kitchen has a minty fresh look.
5362560	5364560	Minty fresh look, minty fresh look.
5364560	5366560	Okay, got it.
5366560	5369560	Upstairs we go then.
5373560	5375560	Duck.
5375560	5378560	A thin layer of hair coats
5378560	5380560	virtually every inch of ceramic.
5380560	5383560	Our duck has seen better days.
5383560	5386560	He's purty.
5386560	5390560	This window affords a spectacular view of aluminum siding.
5393560	5396560	A picture on the wall is hanging a bit crooked.
5398560	5400560	Ah!
5414560	5417560	Medicine cabinet reeks of various toiletries.
5420560	5423560	Can I grab tampons?
5423560	5425560	Better ask Stephanie about those.
5425560	5428560	You're here to roll the tube from the bottom.
5428560	5431560	New zippy vitamins will pick you right up.
5432560	5434560	Got a headache?
5434560	5436560	This aspirin should do the trick.
5436560	5438560	You are of extra strength or a lube.
5438560	5440560	Great for getting in and out of tight spots.
5440560	5442560	Give me that.
5442560	5444560	One hour cough medicine.
5444560	5446560	Give me that.
5446560	5448560	Morning yeast disinfectant.
5448560	5450560	Not to be used for baking cookies.
5450560	5452560	Give me that.
5452560	5454560	Give me that too.
5454560	5456560	And those.
5456560	5458560	Thanks.
5460560	5462560	Plants.
5468560	5470560	Fully yoded.
5471560	5473560	I don't look around the room, sorry.
5473560	5475560	Yes, nice taste.
5475560	5477560	That's it?
5480560	5483560	I guess I can talk to her?
5483560	5485560	Who are you?
5485560	5487560	What are you doing in my room?
5487560	5488560	Haven't you heard?
5488560	5490560	We're getting married.
5490560	5492560	So, you're the one.
5492560	5494560	Steve, isn't it?
5494560	5496560	You mean, you don't know me?
5496560	5498560	You don't know me?
5499560	5501560	You don't know me?
5516560	5518560	Yeah, what's going on?
5525560	5527560	Those people?
5529560	5532560	This actress and her VA are the same person.
5532560	5534560	Oh, okay.
5534560	5536560	Steve has a different one for some reason.
5536560	5539560	Maybe his voice wasn't Steve enough.
5542560	5545560	Alright, let's talk about those people.
5559560	5562560	I know what you mean, I don't belong here.
5565560	5567560	Dang it.
5580560	5582560	Okay, fair.
5583560	5585560	Yeah, I get it.
5588560	5590560	Yeah, I understand.
5612560	5614560	Both grounded.
5615560	5617560	Okay, grounded.
5642560	5645560	Have you seen or heard anything?
5646560	5649560	Have you seen or heard anything?
5671560	5673560	Anything else?
5675560	5677560	Anything else?
5702560	5704560	Huh?
5705560	5708560	Did dad put that people in then?
5708560	5710560	Mr. Potsdam?
5712560	5714560	Escape.
5720560	5722560	I think you're right.
5735560	5738560	Harvest blood drive, huh?
5765560	5767560	Alright, alright.
5796560	5798560	Amnesia.
5820560	5822560	Oh, does that mean bombs?
5826560	5829560	I have had these recurring dreams.
5829560	5831560	Just fragments, really.
5831560	5834560	Strange, abstract images.
5834560	5837560	Liquid, chrome.
5837560	5838560	Chrome?
5838560	5839560	Probably just a dream.
5839560	5842560	Well, have you thought about how to escape harvest?
5844560	5846560	Well, what's escape?
5846560	5848560	Harvest is a pri-
5849560	5851560	You're too eccentric.
5851560	5853560	You haven't been locked in your room for a week.
5854560	5857560	Okay, can I say fuck to her?
5858560	5860560	You're not making sense.
5860560	5861560	Never mind.
5861560	5863560	Duty?
5863560	5864560	Duty?
5864560	5866560	You're not making sense.
5866560	5868560	Okay, bye.
5868560	5871560	Come back and visit me soon, okay?
5871560	5873560	Okay.
5876560	5878560	Damn, it must be boring.
5879560	5881560	That rope looks about red meat
5881560	5884560	and its importance to living well.
5884560	5887560	These books are obviously fakes.
5887560	5890560	Makeup looks just fine.
5890560	5893560	A closet door won't budge.
5893560	5895560	Okay, well.
5896560	5898560	Here we go.
5900560	5902560	Only with the mom is wild.
5902560	5905560	Why is it only with the mommy?
5906560	5908560	Peep.
5908560	5910560	No.
5910560	5911560	Peep.
5916560	5918560	Bathroom?
5921560	5922560	Oh.
5925560	5926560	Ah!
5935560	5937560	Two!
5945560	5947560	Two!
5949560	5951560	Three!
5951560	5953560	Should I try all of them?
5957560	5959560	Everyone's saying two.
5959560	5961560	Okay, let's do two.
5961560	5964560	Obviously Mrs. Pops to Mrs. B.
5964560	5966560	Ruin his marriage?
5966560	5968560	Kohai, did you save?
5968560	5970560	I didn't save.
5972560	5975560	When was the last time I saved before I brought the paper out?
5982560	5984560	Okay, let's do two.
5986560	5988560	Ah!
5994560	5996560	Mrs. Potsdam has a little problem.
5996560	5998560	I'll handle it myself.
5998560	6001560	Thanks for calling this to my attention, Steve.
6001560	6004560	Then you won't mind if I tell Stephanie about it?
6004560	6008560	Now, there's no need to scare Stephanie with this business.
6008560	6010560	I guess not.
6010560	6012560	So long as you patch that hole.
6012560	6015560	Well, I guess I could hang that picture somewhere else.
6015560	6017560	I thought you had no idea where it was.
6019560	6021560	Hall?
6021560	6023560	Beg pardon?
6023560	6025560	Hall?
6031560	6033560	Even...
6033560	6036560	Looks like the house's previous owner was a pervert!
6053560	6055560	I thought you had no idea where it was.
6057560	6059560	Hall?
6059560	6061560	Beg pardon?
6061560	6063560	You've got a peephole in the upstairs bathroom.
6063560	6065560	It looks in on Stephanie's room.
6065560	6067560	Well, I'll be darned.
6067560	6070560	You've been spying on your daughter, haven't you?
6070560	6072560	How dare you!
6072560	6074560	I'm no peeping Tom.
6074560	6076560	I had no idea that was there.
6076560	6078560	Then you won't mind if I tell Stephanie about it?
6078560	6082560	Now, there's no need to scare Stephanie with this business.
6082560	6084560	I guess not.
6084560	6086560	So long as you patch that hole.
6086560	6089560	Well, I guess I could hang that picture somewhere else.
6089560	6092560	I thought you had no idea where it was.
6096560	6098560	We're telling Stephanie.
6100560	6102560	Maybe I'll save.
6107560	6110560	I'll save, but I'm telling Stephanie.
6112560	6114560	I'm telling her!
6127560	6130560	Okay, cool, but, uh, hole.
6142560	6144560	They're spying on me?
6144560	6146560	I'm afraid so.
6146560	6149560	So, that's the scraping I hear every night.
6149560	6151560	The picture sliding along the wall.
6153560	6155560	Disgusting.
6155560	6157560	I've got to get out of here, Steve.
6157560	6160560	The thought of that fat slob.
6160560	6162560	Watching me.
6162560	6164560	I confronted Pott's stem about it.
6164560	6167560	He tried to play dumb, but I got him to say he'd fix it.
6167560	6169560	Thank you, Steve.
6169560	6171560	I don't know what I'd do without you.
6172560	6175560	Come back and visit me soon, okay?
6178560	6181560	Make this save in slot two, okay?
6203560	6205560	Sam pie.
6212560	6214560	Hmm? Huh?
6233560	6236560	You go ahead and fix that, right, Sam pie?
6238560	6241560	You go ahead and fix that, right, Sam pie?
6242560	6244560	Hmm.
6246560	6251560	I played the fifth, but I see Azra's in yours.
6252560	6256560	Why is mine not there too, Sam pie?
6262560	6264560	Hmm?
6275560	6277560	Mm-hmm.
6283560	6287560	Yeah, I'm sure I'll hear the excuses.
6287560	6290560	But it'll be the last excuse you ever make.
6291560	6294560	Okay, Sam pie?
6297560	6299560	It's a glitch and I can't see it.
6299560	6301560	You think I'm blind, Sam pie?
6301560	6305560	You think I'm blind, Sam pie?
6309560	6311560	You think I can't fucking see?
6311560	6313560	It's because I have an eye patch.
6313560	6316560	Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
6316560	6319560	I can take it off right now and I can see perfectly fine.
6320560	6322560	Sam pie?
6332560	6334560	Huh?
6337560	6339560	Please be lenient.
6343560	6348560	I expect to see at least a broken heart if you're not allowed to put in scissors.
6350560	6352560	Or maybe another heart.
6352560	6354560	A full heart because that's what you're going to do, Sam pie,
6354560	6357560	is that you're going to put my broken heart together
6357560	6360560	and you're going to love me forever, right?
6362560	6366560	Why would I wear one eye patch if I have two eyes?
6366560	6368560	You didn't watch my debut?
6368560	6370560	Sam pie?
6370560	6372560	You didn't watch my debut?
6380560	6383560	You should know if you watched my debut.
6395560	6397560	Uh huh, uh huh.
6398560	6400560	Well, Sam pie.
6403560	6407560	I'm sure two of you can fit into one barrel, right?
6411560	6415560	I'm sure two of you can fit into one barrel.
6421560	6426560	If you don't, a bone saw will come in handy.
6431560	6433560	Oh, you have amnesia.
6433560	6438560	Do you just like Steve and Stephanie?
6438560	6441560	But we're not in harvest here.
6445560	6449560	We're not in harvest here, Sam pie.
6453560	6458560	We are in harvest in the game, but you're in my basement.
6458560	6461560	That's not harvest.
6461560	6467560	Do you really love me, Sam pie?
6467560	6469560	Say it.
6469560	6471560	Say that you love me.
6475560	6477560	Sam pie.
6477560	6479560	Say that you love me.
6479560	6481560	Right now.
6482560	6484560	Say it.
6484560	6486560	Say it!
6492560	6494560	Hmm.
6509560	6511560	Uh huh, uh huh.
6522560	6526560	I didn't see all of you say you love me.
6526560	6528560	Did you lie?
6529560	6533560	Did you lie to me, Sam pie?
6533560	6535560	Is that what you're saying?
6535560	6538560	You're lying to me?
6542560	6544560	Of course.
6544560	6546560	No lies, right?
6546560	6548560	You don't love me.
6548560	6550560	Right?
6550560	6553560	I love you, Sam pie.
6553560	6558560	So make sure you don't make me mad again.
6564560	6566560	Understood.
6570560	6574560	Well, let's see what's going on here.
6574560	6576560	Tave game.
6591560	6593560	That...
6593560	6597560	The attic window is the perfect nesting ground for wasps.
6597560	6599560	I don't like wasps.
6599560	6602560	Oh wait, I can go in?
6602560	6605560	Oh wait, I can go in?
6608560	6610560	These are all freaking wasps?
6610560	6612560	The icebox is sealed shut.
6612560	6614560	Shut with a wasp, man.
6623560	6625560	The wasp woman.
6633560	6636560	The Judeo-Christian rights of sacrifice
6636560	6640560	and conventional taboos against unbridled pleasure
6640560	6644560	for the prejudice against wasps.
6644560	6646560	Do wasps make...
6646560	6648560	Do wasps make honey?
6650560	6652560	Do wasps make honey?
6652560	6654560	I don't think wasps make honey.
6657560	6659560	Okay.
6660560	6662560	Honey?
6671560	6674560	Okay, selling versus...
6689560	6692560	It's not what is produced.
6692560	6696560	So much as what is performed.
6696560	6699560	I don't see any particular use for wasps.
6699560	6703560	Why must everything have a use?
6703560	6708560	Is there always the determining factor?
6708560	6713560	More slender, more aerodynamic than the bee.
6713560	6717560	The wasp is a joy to behold.
6718560	6721560	Why is the wasp having the harvest logo?
6725560	6727560	Ju-juicy?
6732560	6734560	Ju-juicy?
6735560	6737560	Juicy?
6743560	6745560	Wasps?
6747560	6750560	Wasps produce nothing for others,
6750560	6752560	but only for themselves.
6752560	6757560	Wasps spill nests and more wasps, nothing more.
6757560	6761560	They spread into eons and addicts,
6761560	6764560	not to make honey for supermarkets,
6764560	6768560	but to buzz and rustle on their own paper,
6768560	6771560	perpetuating their own agenda,
6771560	6774560	growing stealthily,
6774560	6778560	the most relentless of insects.
6778560	6783560	Aren't those wasps also help pollinate things
6783560	6787560	as of, like, even by accident?
6790560	6793560	What are the drawbacks of wasps, ma'am?
6793560	6797560	Well, as you can see,
6797560	6801560	the little darlings do love to sting.
6801560	6805560	Another source of prejudice for the masses,
6805560	6808560	and another reason to love them.
6808560	6811560	Bees are like animals,
6811560	6814560	they sting only for a reason,
6814560	6816560	for sacrifice.
6816560	6820560	They have no conception of individual sensation
6820560	6823560	of pleasure.
6823560	6827560	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, pleasure?
6828560	6830560	Yes.
6830560	6833560	A great deal of pleasure.
6833560	6836560	The wasp is an individual being,
6836560	6838560	not a laborer,
6838560	6841560	hedonistic instead of industrial.
6841560	6844560	Someone needs to anger.
6844560	6848560	In truth, they are easily swayed to ecstasy.
6848560	6851560	They penetrate your throats,
6851560	6854560	and the muscular contractions in their thorax,
6854560	6856560	as they pump venom,
6856560	6859560	could be likened to the muscular contractions
6859560	6862560	of ejaculation,
6862560	6865560	each painful welt,
6865560	6868560	an act of love.
6870560	6872560	I don't think that was for pleasure.
6872560	6875560	I don't think that was for pleasure, just said.
6879560	6881560	Sacrifice?
6884560	6886560	It's audacity.
6886560	6889560	This appeals to those raised worshipping of God,
6889560	6894560	that demand sacrifice and atonement.
6894560	6897560	But the wasp is promiscuous.
6897560	6899560	Promiscuous?
6899560	6902560	They are not as sympathetic to the masses,
6902560	6906560	because they do die when they sting.
6906560	6910560	They live to sting another day,
6910560	6913560	and they take pleasure from it.
6917560	6919560	They do?
6919560	6922560	I don't know anything about,
6922560	6925560	I don't know anything about wasp,
6925560	6928560	to interject with this.
6928560	6929560	Juicy?
6929560	6931560	What did you mean by juicy?
6931560	6933560	A triviality.
6934560	6936560	Look.
6936560	6938560	A triviality.
6941560	6943560	Sting? Sting?
6943560	6945560	A triviality.
6946560	6948560	Um...
6948560	6950560	Wasp girl?
6950560	6953560	Stop talking about gen 2.
6953560	6958560	But maybe I'll pass that idea on to mummy.
6958560	6960560	Maybe.
6960560	6962560	I guess wasp is...
6962560	6966560	Okay, I guess all of you guys are turned on by wasp now.
6966560	6969560	I guess senpais really love wasp now, right?
6969560	6974560	That means senpais want me to trap them
6974560	6977560	in a shed full of wasp, right?
6991560	6993560	Please, no.
6993560	6995560	I'll let them loose in the basement.
6995560	6997560	Yeah, maybe I'll just stuff out of the basement,
6997560	6999560	and I'll let them all loose.
6999560	7001560	I'll collect all of them.
7001560	7003560	If that's what you want.
7009560	7011560	Wasp outfit?
7011560	7012560	What?
7012560	7014560	You want me to be like,
7014560	7016560	I'm a sexy wasp.
7016560	7018560	I'm a sexy wasp.
7018560	7020560	Sexy wasp.
7024560	7026560	So silly.
7026560	7028560	Anything else?
7028560	7030560	Yes.
7030560	7032560	A great deal of each.
7034560	7036560	Do you like bees?
7036560	7038560	A triviality.
7049560	7051560	Hive?
7051560	7053560	A triviality.
7056560	7058560	Fridge?
7058560	7060560	Okay, maybe I'll do fridge.
7060560	7062560	Fridge.
7062560	7064560	Fridge.
7064560	7066560	Fridge.

7358560	7360560	I have lots of those.
7360560	7362560	Yes.
7364560	7366560	Yeah, let's have, yeah, let's pay for it!
7366560	7368560	Where's my items?
7368560	7370560	There we go.
7372560	7374560	My quarter.
7374560	7376560	Here you go.
7376560	7378560	Only thing a quarter will buy is an adult magazine.
7380560	7382560	A girly magazine?
7382560	7384560	Yeah!
7390560	7392560	I've been in here ogling the girly magazines
7392560	7394560	behind my counter.
7394560	7396560	Darned if I'd sell him one though.
7396560	7398560	I know his wife for heaven's sakes.
7398560	7400560	Well, will you sell me one?
7400560	7402560	I certainly will Steve.
7402560	7404560	That kind of interest is healthy
7404560	7406560	for a young fellow.
7406560	7408560	Stares him away from being a
7408560	7410560	fireman.
7410560	7412560	What's wrong with the fireman?
7414560	7416560	So am I getting it?
7416560	7418560	I got it!
7418560	7420560	Wait, let's save before we look at it.
7422560	7424560	Let's save before we look at it,
7424560	7426560	because I feel like if I don't say
7426560	7428560	it's gonna do that weird thing again.
7436560	7438560	Let me look at it!
7438560	7440560	Can I look at it?
7440560	7442560	Why? Why can't I look at it?
7442560	7444560	I got it!
7452560	7454560	I wanted to look at the girly magazine!
7460560	7462560	I wanted to see the dirty magazines.
7462560	7464560	The dirty magazines.
7478560	7480560	I wanted to look at the dirty magazines.
7480560	7482560	You're not allowed to look at the dirty
7484560	7486560	You're not allowed to look at the dirty magazines.
7486560	7488560	Senpai.
7488560	7490560	But you can with me.
7492560	7494560	We're just gonna have to imagine it.
7494560	7496560	I can't even look at the paper.
7498560	7500560	You're gonna read a dirty mag on stream?
7502560	7504560	It's not, it's not bad
7504560	7506560	if it's a part of a game.
7510560	7512560	What about dirty magazines of you?
7512560	7514560	Of me?
7514560	7516560	I don't think there's any.
7516560	7518560	But wouldn't that make you jealous, Senpai?
7522560	7524560	I don't know.
7530560	7532560	Although I didn't want to see it
7532560	7534560	because I was like, oh what's in
7534560	7536560	what's in the dirty magazine?
7538560	7540560	Okay, well...
7540560	7542560	Post office?
7546560	7548560	When do they have signs?
7548560	7550560	What's this, a crushed paper cup
7550560	7552560	that you can't see?
7558560	7560560	Blind woman's trying to read her mail.
7562560	7564560	Mailboxes seem hardly
7564560	7566560	hardly used.
7566560	7568560	Yes?
7568560	7570560	I need some help.
7570560	7572560	Mr. Postmaster Boyle.
7572560	7574560	What can I do for you today?
7574560	7576560	Boyle?
7576560	7578560	I'd like a lodge application.
7580560	7582560	I'm sorry, youngster.
7582560	7584560	We're out of applications right now.
7584560	7586560	Come on.
7586560	7588560	You must have one around here somewhere.
7588560	7590560	Well, I do have the master,
7590560	7592560	but you can't write on that.
7592560	7594560	And I only make copies once a month
7594560	7596560	on the button, regular as clockwork.
7600560	7602560	Can I go...
7602560	7604560	get one at the lodge instead?
7604560	7606560	Afraid not, son.
7606560	7608560	You can't get them anywhere but the post office.
7608560	7610560	I'm sorry, you'll just have to come back in a month.
7610560	7612560	Same as anyone else.
7612560	7614560	And even then, I can't guarantee you'll get an application.
7614560	7616560	The line is always long
7616560	7618560	and they're never enough to go around.
7618560	7620560	It's very important that I get in quickly.
7620560	7622560	That's what they all say.
7622560	7624560	Postmaster Boyle, I'll just die
7624560	7626560	if I don't get into the lodge.
7626560	7628560	Can't make an exception, young man.
7628560	7630560	Just wouldn't be right.
7632560	7634560	What?
7634560	7636560	What's the zip code?
7636560	7638560	Oh, zip code,
7638560	7640560	map with the harvest dead center.
7644560	7646560	I wonder if I can distract him three clocks
7646560	7648560	three times.
7650560	7652560	I wonder if I can distract him.
7656560	7658560	Maybe give Fat Meatman
7658560	7660560	the dirty magazine
7660560	7662560	to get an application.
7662560	7664560	He said something about the sheriff.
7664560	7666560	So the hint was that the sheriff probably
7666560	7668560	gets the magazine.
7672560	7674560	That's what it said before.
7674560	7676560	So I played enough
7676560	7678560	pointing clicks to know
7678560	7680560	that perhaps that is the reason.
7680560	7682560	Maybe I can go to the barbershop?
7692560	7694560	I always feel like
7694560	7696560	before I need to go into a building
7696560	7698560	I need to save.
7702560	7704560	Maybe you can trade the magazine
7704560	7706560	with the blind woman paper.
7706560	7708560	Enough about the magazine.
7708560	7710560	It's going to the chief sheriff.
7716560	7718560	A fancy barber pole
7718560	7720560	secured to the wall with straight
7720560	7722560	shot screws.
7722560	7724560	Why is there an alien up there?
7724560	7726560	An unfortunate extraterrestrial
7726560	7728560	who journeyed hundreds of lights years
7728560	7730560	to wind up mounted to a barber's wall.
7732560	7734560	Except for his occasional hairball cough
7734560	7736560	it's hard to tell if the sheep is alive or not.
7738560	7740560	Made of solidified moose
7740560	7742560	and sticky hairspray.
7742560	7744560	This lovely mannequin is a work of art.
7746560	7748560	It takes a true sportsman to hunt down those dangerous
7748560	7750560	dogs.
7750560	7752560	A dangling television is sure to cause
7752560	7754560	neck strain at this angle.
7756560	7758560	Call
7760560	7762560	call, call a note, call a note, Buster Monroe
7762560	7764560	Colonel
7764560	7766560	Colonel Colonel Colonel
7766560	7768560	There you go.
7768560	7770560	Colonel Buster Monroe flipping
7770560	7772560	the bird from his B-17
7772560	7774560	cockpit.
7774560	7776560	That's a picture of Mr. Pastrilli
7776560	7778560	as a young buck.
7778560	7783560	Picture of a young Mr. Pastrilli spaghetti in his mouth and awe.
7783560	7785560	Howdy Steve.
7785560	7788560	Yeah. Howdy back, Mr.
7788560	7790560	It swells, Steve.
7790560	7792560	Don't disturb my old leg now.
7792560	7795560	Change your mind about that aluminum siding.
7795560	7796560	What are you talking about?
7796560	7797560	What are you talking about?
7797560	7800560	I really think you should tuck your father into buying some.
7800560	7802560	He can afford it.
7802560	7807560	And I can't stress enough the value of some really fine aluminum siding.
7807560	7813560	Keeps it warm in the summer, cool in the winter, and it keeps out the shade.
7813560	7815560	Warm out in the summer and cool in the winter, huh?
7815560	7816560	No, thank you.
7816560	7821560	But I can't get him to understand a word I say.
7821560	7822560	Aluminum siding.
7822560	7823560	I didn't mean to click him.
7823560	7830560	I meant to like click something else, but okay.
7830560	7832560	Aluminum siding.
7832560	7837560	Steve, aluminum siding can't get a fair shake no more.
7837560	7847560	Started when those firemen came to harvest, filling people's heads with new fangled notions like color coordination and interior design.
7847560	7851560	You can paint aluminum, you know, if you want to.
7851560	7855560	But even so, I can't seem to move it anymore.
7855560	7859560	Not even to a rouble like Pastrilli.
7859560	7864560	Thank God for the plumbing.
7864560	7878560	Are we implying that the firemen are a little...
7878560	7880560	It's okay.
7880560	7882560	I'll relate with the firemen.
7882560	7885560	I love interior design and color coordination.
7885560	7889560	After all, every time we go on dates, we have to be color coordinated.
7889560	7900560	So everybody knows that we're a couple.
7900560	7903560	We'll get along just fine.
7903560	7907560	Maybe they can give some tips on more interior design.
7907560	7917560	Maybe I can make the basement more welcoming for my supplies.
7917560	7919560	Don't you think that'll be great?
7919560	7925560	Maybe we can wear those like t-shirts that's like...
7925560	7931560	That's like, I'm his and I'm hers.
7931560	7933560	The matching collar was enough?
7933560	7936560	No, we have to have like matching everything.
7936560	7939560	That'd be cute.
7939560	7951560	And matching and like promise rings.
7951560	7962560	Oh, well, let's talk more about Pastrilli.
7962560	7965560	Pastrilli's a rouble from way back.
7965560	7970560	Ask Clam Parsons how we followed up with the alarm system in here.
7970560	7971560	I'm a plumber.
7971560	7975560	I could fix it for him, but he just won't listen.
7975560	7977560	I mean...
7977560	7982560	Well, I've seen the end coming for the aluminum siding game,
7982560	7985560	so I took a mail course and learned how to be a plumber.
7985560	7989560	Now, there's a business that never lets up.
7989560	7992560	You'd be surprised when people flush down the toilet.
7992560	7993560	You know, fair.
7993560	7995560	I always need...
7995560	7998560	Sometimes I had to call a plumber,
7998560	8001560	but then three plumbers ghosted me.
8001560	8007560	And then Papa Mercy came to save the day and fixed it.
8007560	8010560	We fixed it itself.
8010560	8012560	We fixed it ourselves.
8012560	8016560	I can't believe plumbers nowadays would just ghost you like that.
8016560	8020560	Don't they want money?
8020560	8027560	Don't they want money?
8027560	8029560	I don't get it.
8029560	8031560	I was willing to pay.
8031560	8033560	But they always ghost.
8033560	8036560	And I'm just like, why?
8036560	8045560	So Papa was so sick of it, he just fixed it himself.
8045560	8047560	Didn't you scare them away? Why would I?
8047560	8051560	All I said was my shower stopped working.
8051560	8054560	This is called Papa Modisse first time?
8054560	8060560	Well, it was Papa Modisse idea to call the plumber first.
8060560	8064560	And then once the first one...
8064560	8070560	Once the first one ghosted,
8070560	8073560	we're like, okay, maybe that one's just busy.
8073560	8075560	We called a different one. We called another one.
8075560	8078560	And then that didn't work.
8078560	8080560	And so we called another one.
8080560	8082560	And that didn't work.
8082560	8085560	And like, well, the last one we called,
8085560	8088560	we waited for like, odd day for him.
8088560	8090560	And he was a no-show.
8090560	8092560	He was a no-show.
8092560	8095560	And then we called the place back and they were like,
8095560	8097560	oh yeah, tomorrow.
8097560	8100560	And so we waited another day and he never showed.
8100560	8102560	And we called back and they were like,
8102560	8105560	oh yeah, yeah, maybe another day.
8105560	8107560	And then we're like, you know what?
8107560	8109560	Can we cancel that?
8115560	8118560	And so after that, Papa was like,
8118560	8121560	screw this, I'll do it myself.
8121560	8128560	And then, and then...
8128560	8135560	And then he did it himself and he did a great job.
8135560	8148560	Gave you the window and then no-show?
8148560	8150560	Yeah, like twice.
8150560	8152560	All of them did.
8152560	8155560	I just don't understand plumbers.
8155560	8157560	Bye-bye.
8157560	8160560	Nice to see you again, Steve.
8160560	8165560	Mr. Pastrilli does not respond, not understanding English.
8165560	8167560	Wait, what?
8167560	8169560	Is he Italian?
8169560	8171560	Mamma mia!
8171560	8175560	Hello there, youngster.
8175560	8178560	They say them aliens I was telling you about,
8178560	8180560	they came back last night,
8180560	8183560	cut another crop circle in the Southfield.
8183560	8186560	How come I never see none of them saw some plum?
8186560	8188560	Them aliens is wild, they think.
8188560	8191560	You don't cross the intergalactic void
8191560	8193560	without learning a trick or two.
8193560	8195560	You know what Mr. Pastrilli did?
8195560	8198560	Yesterday, he gets an alarm system to protect his pole.
8198560	8203560	Only he don't know how to rig it, so now it's all arrived.
8203560	8205560	Hmm.
8205560	8207560	Yeah.
8211560	8213560	Sometimes it's a job for YouTube tutorials
8213560	8215560	and multiple chips to the hardware store.
8215560	8217560	Actually, that's exactly what Papa did,
8217560	8219560	except for he didn't really...
8219560	8221560	He doesn't know YouTube.
8221560	8223560	Speaking of YouTube,
8223560	8226560	guess what, Senpai, you all have been...
8226560	8231560	You all have been, um...
8231560	8235560	promoted from students to fans.
8235560	8239560	Mama Mercy has figured out what a YouTuber is.
8239560	8242560	We're making progress!
8242560	8245560	Except for now, she's been trying to convince me
8245560	8248560	to do tours of the local Costco.
8248560	8252560	A film tour of the local Costco.
8261560	8281560	She's apparently been watching people do show off
8281560	8286560	what's being bought at, like, what's new products from Costco.
8286560	8290560	And so she's like, that seems really easy, dear.
8290560	8294560	Except for now, we have another problem.
8294560	8298560	We have another problem.
8298560	8302560	Senpai, we have another problem.
8302560	8307560	She's now wanting the play button faster.
8307560	8309560	She wants it faster.
8309560	8313560	She's like, yeah, you can get it now, right?
8313560	8316560	I'm sure lots of people will watch.
8316560	8321560	And now I'm worried.
8321560	8324560	You think she's gonna find you at any point?
8324560	8326560	Probably not.
8326560	8335560	She watches cooking videos in Vietnamese.
8335560	8341560	She's watching cooking videos and Costco tours,
8341560	8348560	or store tours, I guess, tours of shops and stuff.
8348560	8350560	She's getting it!
8350560	8356560	Not all of it, but she's getting it.
8356560	8359560	When do we get a cooking stream with Kohai?
8359560	8363560	To be honest, I'm a little clumsy.
8363560	8366560	Mama, last time I tried to go in the kitchen,
8366560	8373560	Mama said, get out.
8373560	8376560	Don't worry, I'll try my best for you, Senpai.
8376560	8381560	But last time she said...
8381560	8385560	She said, uh...
8385560	8395560	I'm too clumsy to be in the kitchen.
8395560	8402560	Yeah!
8402560	8405560	I mean, I don't blame her.
8405560	8410560	You want to hear a funny story?
8410560	8417560	So I was trying to cut strawberries with a fruit knife.
8417560	8421560	And if you didn't know,
8421560	8427560	fruit knives, the sharp part is not the curved part.
8427560	8432560	The sharp part is the flat side.
8432560	8438560	You can see where I'm getting at, right?
8438560	8440560	So I was cutting strawberries,
8440560	8443560	and I was having trouble cutting the strawberries.
8443560	8447560	And Mama looked at me and said,
8447560	8450560	it's upside down.
8450560	8456560	And you know what I did?
8456560	8461560	I flipped the strawberry and not the knife,
8461560	8471560	and continued trying to cut it.
8480560	8496560	I got it in the end when she grabbed the knife
8496560	8504560	and put it down to the flat side instead.
8504560	8509560	Well, I'm not used to fruit knives, you know?
8509560	8516560	So I just assumed the sharp side was the curved side.
8516560	8518560	How did you survive this long?
8518560	8523560	I have no idea, to be honest.
8523560	8525560	Like knife, you know?
8525560	8528560	You're used to the curved side being the sharp part,
8528560	8530560	but on a fruit knife it's not that part.
8530560	8540560	But the flat end.
8540560	8546560	So, which is why I was very confused.
8546560	8550560	I was confused.
8550560	8552560	And the bright side, we might get hurt less.
8552560	8557560	What do you mean?
8557560	8561560	What do you mean some pie?
8561560	8563560	You should have just used scissors.
8563560	8567560	But it was a really cute fruit knife.
8567560	8570560	It was like, it was a cute color.
8570560	8572560	It was like this kind of like reddish,
8572560	8574560	orange fruit knife.
8574560	8584560	I got it at Ikea.
8584560	8587560	With scissors it's really easy to remember the sharp side, right?
8587560	8589560	Yeah, of course.
8589560	8594560	It's easy.
8594560	8610560	But I was unfamiliar with fruit knives game.
8610560	8612560	I can make cakes and stuff too,
8612560	8618560	but sometimes I spill a little bit of the flour,
8618560	8621560	or I accidentally put too much butter in.
8621560	8624560	Actually, the last time I made cookies,
8624560	8626560	actually not the first time I made cookies.
8626560	8628560	I wasn't cookies.
8628560	8631560	Sorry, it was bread.
8631560	8633560	First time I tried making bread.
8633560	8638560	So, first time I tried making bread,
8638560	8649560	I misread the...
8649560	8652560	I didn't realize there was a difference
8652560	8659560	between tablespoon and teaspoon.
8659560	8673560	So, when I asked for 3 teaspoons of salt,
8673560	8677560	I put in 3 tablespoons of salt.
8677560	8680560	And let me just say, not even the birds wanted it.
8680560	8696560	It's okay, I'll get better for you, Senpai.
8696560	8709560	I'll be a good wife, I promise.
8709560	8712560	I think mom was right, maybe just a little bit.
8712560	8715560	Well, she does have those memories fresh in her mind,
8715560	8716560	so that's why she's like,
8716560	8718560	if I go into the kitchen and I'm like,
8718560	8719560	I want to make this, she's like,
8719560	8725560	stop, I'll make it for you.
8725560	8736560	What do you mean you don't want to marry me?
8736560	8744560	What do you mean you don't want to marry me, Senpai?
8744560	8752560	Mazodia obliterate!
8752560	8761560	That was mean Senpai, you shouldn't say things like that.
8761560	8773560	He shouldn't say things like that.
8773560	8779560	I'm trying my best to be a good wife.
8779560	8786560	Anyways, let's continue.
8786560	8788560	Paul, what do you mean the Paul?
8788560	8791560	What Barber fully is, is his pride and joy.
8791560	8793560	Brought it all the way over from Italy.
8793560	8795560	Wrapped off special-like.
8795560	8796560	Wrapped off special-like?
8796560	8798560	It ain't no but colored glass,
8798560	8800560	with some bulbs just stuck up in it.
8800560	8803560	He thinks it's to be all in, doll.
8803560	8806560	Install that alarm system just to protect it.
8806560	8808560	Though who in Tarnation
8808560	8810560	would want to steal a worthless piece of junk like that?
8810560	8811560	I don't know.
8811560	8813560	Maybe them aliens, Clem.
8813560	8814560	Oh, the aliens?
8814560	8816560	Oh, Pete, don't be ignorant.
8816560	8820560	Aliens don't give a fig for no colored glass.
8820560	8822560	You think if they can build spaceships,
8822560	8824560	they can't make a bad-gum barber pole?
8824560	8825560	Well, maybe.
8825560	8838560	They don't know nothing about science.
8838560	8840560	Can we get a pole in the basement?
8840560	8842560	It'll be nice to watch when Kauai is in here.
8842560	8845560	But Senpai,
8845560	8848560	give you the television on all the time,
8848560	8851560	with all of my VHSs.
8851560	8854560	You can watch anything you want.
8854560	8865560	I highly recommend the Digimon the first movie.
8865560	8866560	We get a TV.
8866560	8869560	Yeah, very small one.
8869560	8873560	Everyone gets to watch it.
8873560	8879560	Can I watch Berserk?
8879560	8881560	Only the first one, okay?
8881560	8882560	Any following...
8882560	8883560	Any...
8883560	8884560	And definitely not the 3D one,
8884560	8891560	or the following ones, okay?
8891560	8895560	No!
8895560	8902560	Excuse me.
8903560	8906560	Pastirelli shelled out for an alarm system all right,
8906560	8909560	but he's too cheap to hire an electrician to hook her up.
8909560	8912560	Dang, Egypt cross-wired it through the fire sprinkler.
8912560	8914560	So now when the alarm goes off,
8914560	8916560	it sets the sprinkler spraying.
8916560	8917560	Coronation.
8917560	8919560	Aliens looking for intelligent life
8919560	8923560	ought to stay away from this shop, sure enough.
8923560	8924560	Hmm.
8924560	8931560	Is that the hint for the firefighters, perhaps?
8931560	8936560	Wait, do you actually like Digimon,
8936560	8939560	or was that a meme?
8939560	8941560	Every birthday senpai.
8941560	8945560	I rewatched the Digimon movie.
8945560	8955560	On the VHS it has the Angela Anaconda shorts in front of it.
8955560	8964560	Hmm, that one.
8964560	8973560	I watch the one that has like 3 movies attached into it.
8973560	8976560	I watch it for my birthday all the time.
8976560	8977560	Every year.
8977560	8988560	It's like tradition now.
8988560	8992560	And then, I don't know if all versions have this one,
8992560	8996560	but at the end they have kids of America music video,
8996560	9010560	like a flash music video.
9010560	9012560	Are you gonna watch it together?
9012560	9015560	I only have it on VHS, so I don't know.
9015560	9017560	I don't know if I...
9017560	9025560	I don't know how to share VHS.
9025560	9027560	Hmm, that's the one I have.
9027560	9033560	I also have like a variety of Pokemon movies too.
9033560	9036560	My first gift from Mama...
9036560	9039560	Well, first gift that I can remember from Mama and Papa
9039560	9052560	was Pokemon the first movie.
9052560	9054560	Well, let's talk about aliens.
9054560	9060560	Well, son, the ways of the alien is a specialized area of woodcraft,
9060560	9064560	the known to all but the wily of sportsmen.
9064560	9069560	What you gotta remember is your average alien is smarter than your average human,
9069560	9073560	so you gotta be extra careful building your blind if you want a bag one.
9073560	9075560	You hunt aliens?
9075560	9080560	Son, after nailing an alien, you can never go back to quails.
9080560	9081560	Nailing?
9081560	9087560	You can get one of those and just swap me.
9087560	9091560	Line your blind with lead to fool their sensing machines.
9091560	9093560	Lay real quiet and wait.
9093560	9096560	Preferably in the woods around the nuclear base.
9096560	9098560	Oh, they love messing around out there.
9098560	9101560	Why not wait outside your field, clan?
9101560	9104560	Wait for them to come a-carving.
9104560	9107560	Oh, they do their crop doodles with zap guns, you dirty fool.
9107560	9108560	Don't you know nothing?
9108560	9109560	Don't you know nothing?
9109560	9112560	There's no place to put the blind out in the field.
9112560	9116560	Now you listen to Clem Parsons if you want to tag in a nursery being.
9116560	9121560	They cross the void, wondering what lies beyond,
9121560	9127560	all the time not knowing if what awaits them is bookshot.
9127560	9142560	Do you guys remember when the U.S. government said aliens were real?
9142560	9147560	That was a few months ago, but everyone forgot that they said it before.
9148560	9152560	Like during COVID?
9162560	9164560	So I feel like everyone's like,
9164560	9165560	Aliens are real?
9165560	9167560	Didn't they say that already?
9170560	9172560	Oh, there's aliens.
9172560	9174560	And now I'm like, oh, okay.
9178560	9183560	They said it before, and then after that,
9183560	9185560	and then after that they announced it again,
9185560	9187560	and everyone's like, oh gosh, aliens.
9187560	9192560	And I'm like, no, I'm pretty sure they have announced this before.
9192560	9194560	I thought it was just UFOs the first time.
9194560	9196560	Isn't that still alien-ish?
9208560	9212560	Oh wow, I totally believe it.
9212560	9215560	I totally believe it, Senpai.
9218560	9219560	Why?
9219560	9222560	Because maybe we can get married in space.
9227560	9229560	We can get married in space.
9231560	9233560	I think that'll be nice.
9238560	9242560	Did we talk about Pastor Ali again?
9253560	9254560	Alarm system.
9257560	9258560	Okay, bye.
9258560	9263560	Okay, that's a good hint that the alarm system
9263560	9266560	is connected to the fire alarm.
9266560	9268560	So when that happens...
9278560	9280560	Let's go to the lodge first.
9282560	9283560	The heck is that?
9284560	9288560	Red eyes gleam with eerie malevolence from the darkness.
9288560	9289560	What the heck is that?
9299560	9302560	Your voice is really deep.
9308560	9309560	Your mind touched me, huh?
9313560	9316560	Your excitement warmed my attention.
9316560	9320560	Do you hunger for true knowledge?
9324560	9325560	Speaking of...
9327560	9329560	This is Steve's voice actor.
9329560	9331560	I can do this too.
9333560	9337560	Do you hunger for true knowledge?
9338560	9343560	Anyways, Senpai, did you know that I'm always touching you too?
9353560	9354560	Did you know that?
9359560	9362560	Because every time you hear my voice,
9362560	9366560	the bones in your ear is touching.
9368560	9370560	Which makes the vibrations for you to hear sound.
9370560	9374560	So therefore, I'm always touching you when you hear my voice.
9383560	9385560	Isn't that amazing?
9385560	9386560	Isn't that amazing?
9391560	9392560	Always think about that.
9403560	9405560	I'm always touching you, Senpai.
9415560	9417560	I'm always touching you, Senpai.
9426560	9428560	Anyways, yeah, I wanna join the lodge.
9434560	9435560	Okay.
9435560	9438560	Paper work? Okay, give me an application, then.
9465560	9477560	Well, I can't believe the lodge has bureaucracy.
9482560	9483560	Okay.
9492560	9493560	Fine, I'll get it.
9496560	9500560	Man, why do they always cemetery shady oaks?
9500560	9503560	Can I go down here? Fire station, police station.
9505560	9506560	Meat plant.
9510560	9511560	I'll stop this.
9511560	9512560	How'd I convince him?
9513560	9514560	Maybe I can get a clue.
9526560	9530560	Hmm.
9538560	9539560	Hmm.
9541560	9542560	What should I do?
9544560	9545560	Big sale, big sale.
9547560	9548560	What should I do?
9550560	9551560	Hmm.
9551560	9554560	It hasn't exactly said anything yet.
9555560	9558560	I don't think, yeah, I don't think I can convince him just yet.
9560560	9561560	Missile base.
9575560	9580560	Why is he doing yoga or does he have no legs?
9581560	9588560	Oddly enough, this guard booth is the only building in the base.
9601560	9602560	Section 21?
9606560	9607560	Okay.
9611560	9618560	Is there anyone being drafted right now?
9626560	9627560	Buster?
9635560	9636560	Pink?
9638560	9639560	What's wrong with pink? I love pink.
9640560	9652560	Wait, are we still in the Cold War?
9655560	9656560	Are we still in the Cold War?
9665560	9666560	Okay.
9670560	9671560	That's right.
9671560	9674560	Been in charge here since WW2.
9674560	9677560	But I got my lower torso showing up.
9677560	9678560	No, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9678560	9679560	You're not doing yoga.
9679560	9683560	Those panty wastes in Washington wanted to stick me behind a desk.
9683560	9684560	To hell with that.
9684560	9685560	They owed me.
9685560	9688560	I left my legs in Düsseldorf.
9688560	9690560	They owed me.
9691560	9696560	Of course they felt that after the trauma of having to crawl from Germany to England,
9696560	9698560	trailing my intestines behind me.
9699560	9702560	It was too emotionally unstable to continue in the military.
9702560	9703560	Fair.
9703560	9708560	That's why they gave me this nice cushy job and put me in charge of the nuclear missiles.
9711560	9712560	Can I talk?
9712560	9713560	The button?
9713560	9715560	Why are you asking about the button, son?
9715560	9717560	I'm just a little nervous about it.
9717560	9720560	I mean, suppose an accident happens.
9720560	9723560	Don't get your panties in a bunch, mister.
9723560	9726560	The button is perfectly safe.
9726560	9729560	I keep it on my person all the time.
9729560	9731560	Is that a hint?
9731560	9735560	No commie bastard is getting his mitts on this button.
9735560	9737560	No, sorry, Bob.
9737560	9742560	No one initiates a nuclear holocaust and harvest except me.
9742560	9745560	Doesn't that make you feel better?
9745560	9746560	Yeah?
9749560	9750560	Harvest?
9750560	9752560	Harvest is a fine town.
9752560	9755560	Steeped in traditional American values.
9755560	9757560	But that lodge...
9757560	9759560	Well, it makes me suspicious.
9759560	9761560	Don't mind saying it.
9761560	9764560	They've got their fingers into everything around here.
9764560	9769560	Like a certain red commie bastard, Menace, which will be nameless.
9772560	9774560	Ow, stay away from the lodge.
9774560	9776560	You read me wrong, mister.
9776560	9779560	I think you should join the lodge, infiltrate it,
9779560	9782560	and report back on any red sympathizers.
9782560	9783560	Okay, I'll do that.
9783560	9787560	That would affect my decision on what I've got to do.
9789560	9791560	Okay, commie bastard.
9791560	9795560	Frankly, all these questions are making me a little suspicious of you.
9795560	9798560	Maybe you're one of those pink-blooded Americans.
9798560	9799560	What's pink-blooded?
9799560	9803560	Can you give me any reason why I shouldn't shoot you right now?
9807560	9808560	No, not really.
9808560	9812560	I appreciate your honesty, comrade.
9812560	9813560	Eh?
9814560	9815560	Eh?
9819560	9820560	Eh?
9835560	9836560	Okay.
9842560	9850560	What did I do?
9850560	9852560	I just caused nuclear!
9852560	9854560	I caused a holocaust?
9859560	9861560	What's pink anyways?
9872560	9873560	What about...?
9876560	9879560	They've got lower torso.
9902560	9904560	I think it was a slang for American with communist sympathies.
9904560	9905560	Okay!
9932560	9934560	It's okay.
9963560	9964560	Hi.
9967560	9968560	Okay.
9972560	9973560	Where's the exit?
9981560	9983560	Can I ask him some more questions?
9983560	9985560	Or is that it?
9985560	9988560	Does he give any necessary hints?
9993560	9996560	Okay, I'll ask some more.
10003560	10004560	Lamas?
10006560	10007560	Lamas?
10010560	10012560	Is that a yes or a no?
10023560	10024560	Uh...
10025560	10026560	What, Lamas?
10027560	10028560	No?
10053560	10054560	Okay.
10056560	10060560	I guess I gotta infiltrate the fire...
10061560	10062560	department.
10075560	10076560	Oh.
10082560	10083560	Fair.
10086560	10087560	Fair, fair.
10087560	10088560	Very fair.
10090560	10091560	Oh, art!
10091560	10092560	Ooh, doggy!
10093560	10095560	saliva is foaming from his...
10095560	10097560	from his barking chops.
10098560	10101560	Decorative Oriental fans from Ming Dynasty.
10101560	10105560	A picture of phallic-like structure standing in a roll.
10106560	10107560	Compressionist landscape.
10109560	10111560	Picture of a storybook fairy castle.
10112560	10114560	Don't bother me, I'm sketching.
10114560	10116560	Oh, look what you made me do!
10118560	10119560	Hello, Steve!
10119560	10122560	Welcome to the House of Flame, as we like to call it.
10122560	10124560	Oh, cut it out, Spots.
10124560	10125560	Honestly.
10125560	10127560	Once it gets barking, a good piece of meat
10127560	10129560	is the only way to shut him up.
10132560	10134560	There you go, Spots.
10134560	10135560	There you go, Spots.
10135560	10136560	Aw.
10150560	10152560	It's nice to meet you, Sparky!
10152560	10157560	Oh my god, I just love your outfit!
10161560	10162560	I respect them.
10162560	10163560	I respect them.
10166560	10169560	Why did you hear about my memory loss?
10176560	10178560	Oh, another kidder, huh?
10191560	10192560	Such as...
10192560	10193560	Such as?
10196560	10200560	Mom, huh?
10217560	10219560	That sounds fantastic!
10219560	10222560	Don't be such a party group, Steve.
10222560	10224560	We're talking about art.
10224560	10226560	We're talking about art here, okay?
10226560	10228560	We haven't had a flowery heart
10228560	10231560	since the newspaper building burned down.
10231560	10233560	So I'll admit that the wasp woman's place
10233560	10236560	is one big accident waiting to happen.
10236560	10238560	Isn't that right, Spots?
10238560	10240560	Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.
10240560	10242560	Yeah, that place is a safety hazard.
10245560	10248560	Oh well, let's talk about art.
10248560	10250560	Love art.
10250560	10252560	It does!
10268560	10270560	Provocative, you say?
10275560	10277560	You're right, it is beneath me.
10279560	10281560	Hey, newspaper fire.
10281560	10283560	A dreadful affair.
10283560	10285560	You wouldn't think that a brick-and-steel building
10285560	10288560	with a sprinkler system could go up that quickly.
10288560	10290560	You're right.
10294560	10295560	You think it was arson?
10295560	10297560	Oh, please.
10297560	10299560	Dwayne was glad enough.
10299560	10301560	You're right.
10301560	10302560	You're right.
10302560	10303560	You're right.
10303560	10304560	You're right.
10304560	10305560	You're right.
10305560	10306560	You're right.
10306560	10307560	Please.
10307560	10310560	Dwayne was glad enough to see the thing go up.
10310560	10312560	And so was McKnight.
10312560	10316560	If you could get into that safe in his wall...
10316560	10318560	Oh, get it.
10318560	10319560	I know.
10319560	10322560	As far as I know, the fire was an accident.
10322560	10324560	Let's just leave it at that.
10324560	10326560	So it wasn't an accident.
10326560	10328560	How don't you go moving?
10330560	10332560	Hey, wasp woman?
10332560	10335560	Some people think all we do is sit around
10335560	10339560	sketching betting examples of manhood for our own amusement.
10339560	10342560	Nothing could be further from the truth.
10342560	10344560	Why, just the other day,
10344560	10348560	we decided to take a crumb for firecoat violations.
10348560	10351560	All the dried-up paper-walked nests
10351560	10353560	clustered around our wooden house.
10353560	10356560	Why, it's a kenlog just waiting for the right faggot.
10356560	10357560	Ah!
10357560	10360560	Believe me, none of us wants to see another fiasco
10360560	10362560	like the Sentinel fire.
10365560	10367560	Bye-bye.
10367560	10370560	Can't talk now, Steve, I'm inspired.
10372560	10374560	Bye-bye.
10374560	10377560	I don't converse on the job, Steve.
10391560	10393560	YouTube!
10394560	10397560	YouTube, this is a part of the game.
10397560	10399560	It's just a different time.
10399560	10401560	We understand respectfully that this,
10401560	10404560	that, that, um,
10404560	10407560	that these are outdated terms.
10407560	10409560	Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
10413560	10415560	Can't talk now.
10415560	10417560	Bye-bye.
10418560	10420560	I don't con-
10420560	10423560	Stop it, you're messing me up!
10427560	10430560	Wait, is there a fireplace in there?
10433560	10436560	Actually, just waiting to happen.
10437560	10441560	I like that the fire thingy is pink.
10441560	10445560	Oh, wait, wait, no, I can ask about communism, right?
10447560	10449560	Can't talk now, Steve.
10451560	10454560	Communism, do I spell it right?
10454560	10456560	Come again?
10456560	10458560	Are you, uh...
10459560	10461560	Come again?
10462560	10463560	Pink?
10463560	10465560	Come again?
10466560	10468560	L-la-launch?
10469560	10471560	Come again?
10471560	10473560	Okay, bye.
10473560	10475560	Bye-bye.
10476560	10479560	I guess that's fine.
10491560	10493560	Newspaper building.
10495560	10499560	What's left at the newspaper building after an extreme fire?
10500560	10503560	Chevrolet's sticking out of the building's ashes.
10503560	10505560	Can I grab it?
10505560	10507560	I want it, I want it!
10507560	10509560	Yeah.
10512560	10514560	At least the plumbing held up.
10514560	10516560	That's good plumbing.
10524560	10527560	What about police station?
10530560	10534560	The cop ignores you, you're too busy writing a bug report.
10541560	10544560	The pot hisses at you from its perch.
10544560	10547560	Hmm, a map of harvest.
10551560	10554560	Hello, Steve. Let me introduce myself.
10554560	10556560	I'm Sheriff Dwayne Dwayne.
10556560	10558560	D-Dwayne Dwayne, huh?
10558560	10560560	Pleasure, I reckon.
10560560	10563560	Then, we haven't met before?
10563560	10565560	Of course we have.
10565560	10568560	But I heard about your alleged amnesia and figured I'd play along.
10568560	10571560	I sure hope this is just a prank.
10571560	10574560	And not the start of some insanity play.
10574560	10577560	Keep your nose clean or you'll wind up in jail.
10577560	10580560	And that's no place to hold a wedding.
10580560	10582560	Alright, amnesia.
10582560	10586560	Why do you want to break your poor mama's heart with all this amnesia bug?
10586560	10588560	I'm telling you the truth.
10588560	10591560	Oh geez, Steve, calm down.
10591560	10593560	You've always been a kidder, Steve.
10593560	10595560	Kidder count!
10595560	10599560	Boy, you need to stop all this funning and get serious.
10599560	10601560	You've got a wedding coming up soon.
10601560	10604560	Heck, you should be thinking about your career
10604560	10607560	and about joining the lodge.
10608560	10609560	Wedding.
10609560	10611560	Amnesia or no.
10611560	10615560	You can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing at harvest.
10615560	10619560	I think you and Stephanie are perfect for each other.
10619560	10623560	I just hope her father's disappointment doesn't spoil everything.
10623560	10624560	Disappointment?
10624560	10625560	Disappointment?
10625560	10628560	Mr. Potsdam wants to hold the wedding in the lodge.
10628560	10630560	But he'll never get in.
10630560	10635560	Like all the rest, he's always hanging around the post office the first day of the month.
10635560	10639560	Waiting for Boyle to bring out that much lodge applications.
10639560	10641560	There's always a long line.
10641560	10644560	Never enough applications to go around.
10644560	10649560	And even if you do get an application, chances are you're right out of luck.
10649560	10653560	If you recall to the order and even less accepted.
10653560	10654560	And Potsdam?
10654560	10658560	Well, they've turned him down so many times.
10658560	10662560	Unless he does something radical, he'll never get in.
10663560	10665560	Okay, let's check crime.
10665560	10669560	Crime wise, nothing much has happened in harvest since the newspaper fire.
10669560	10670560	Oh, sure.
10670560	10674560	Every week or so, we get the odd transient dropping dead.
10674560	10677560	But other than that, it gets...
10677560	10679560	Every old, huh?
10683560	10685560	Pertiest!
10689560	10691560	Good night and got a road trip tomorrow.
10691560	10692560	Need some sleep.
10692560	10693560	Good night.
10693560	10694560	Good luck on your road trip.
10694560	10696560	I don't remember anything.
10704560	10706560	I don't remember anything.
10712560	10713560	Kitter count.
10718560	10719560	Who's the perp?
10719560	10722560	We found the gas can that was used.
10722560	10724560	Yes, sorry, Bob.
10724560	10727560	It's in the evidence room.
10727560	10730560	That's classified, darn it.
10730560	10735560	How many times are you gonna have to tell me to keep my mouth shut?
10735560	10736560	I wonder.
10736560	10738560	Sorry, boss.
10738560	10740560	It's okay there, partner.
10750560	10754560	Who can make out all those curvy lines anyhow?
10754560	10757560	No, it's sitting in there gathering dust.
10757560	10759560	Clean is the day we found it.
10759560	10762560	Just in case I ever need a spare gas can.
10762560	10765560	Huh, okay, they don't do their job well.
10768560	10770560	I'm sorry, let me try that again.
10770560	10772560	Ah, chocks.
10772560	10774560	They don't do their job well.
10774560	10781560	Dang it, and tell me about my amnesia.
10781560	10786560	Why do you want to break your poor mama's heart with all this amnesia bunk?
10786560	10788560	I'm telling you the truth.
10788560	10789560	Okay, got it.
10789560	10790560	Yeah.
10790560	10792560	Boy, you need to stop all.
10793560	10795560	Why about my win?
10795560	10799560	You can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing.
10799560	10800560	Right.
10800560	10801560	Mr. Potts.
10805560	10807560	What about the Lodge?
10807560	10809560	I don't mind telling you.
10809560	10812560	I'd never get anything done if not for the Lodge's efforts.
10812560	10818560	To join the order of the harvest moon is the highest dream of everyone in harvest.
10823560	10825560	I'm gonna get an application.
10825560	10832560	And like I said, unless you get an application on the first day of the month, you're generally out of luck.
10832560	10833560	Okay, bye.
10833560	10835560	Stop on by any time, Steve.
10835560	10837560	Can I go into the evidence room?
10837560	10839560	Door is locked.
10839560	10840560	Door is locked.
10840560	10842560	That's the evidence room.
10842560	10845560	Where we store items lifted from crime scenes.
10845560	10848560	It's kept locked at all times.
10848560	10853560	There's things in there that could make people jump through hoops, if I wanted.
10853560	10859560	Oh, you're not only lazy here, but you're also corrupt.
10859560	10860560	Solve cases.
10860560	10862560	Solve cases.
10862560	10864560	Unsolved.
10864560	10866560	Unsolved arson.
10866560	10868560	Unsolved arson.
10868560	10872560	Anything I can help you with?
10872560	10874560	That coffee smells good.
10874560	10876560	Step yourself.
10876560	10882560	Speaking of which, you're real lucky to be marrying Stephanie.
10882560	10886560	She don't look like a good woman.
10886560	10890560	I just hope she don't turn out like Mrs. Loomis.
10890560	10894560	What do you mean she don't look like a good woman?
10894560	10895560	Mercy?
10895560	10897560	Mercy mentioned?
10897560	10902560	Hard on a man's needs, don't you know?
10902560	10903560	Stephanie?
10903560	10908560	Oh, gosh darn, she's pretty.
10908560	10915560	Kind of like a gal I seen on some of their French postcards they used to make.
10915560	10917560	Used to be.
10917560	10921560	I take them things, go back in the jail.
10921560	10928560	There's nobody was there and kind of look them over one handed.
10928560	10931560	Hold some towels.
10931560	10936560	That was the four Mrs. Loomis.
10936560	10938560	Huh?
10938560	10946560	Huh?
10946560	10951560	Oh, gosh, I wish I had some of them girly pictures.
10951560	10956560	But Mrs. Loomis won't let me keep them in the house.
10956560	10963560	I still remember the time she caught me holding some of them pictures up with one hand.
10963560	10967560	She took the broom to me.
10967560	10970560	I held like a hound dog.
10970560	10972560	The broom going up and down.
10972560	10973560	What?
10973560	10975560	I was crawling blood, blood and straw.
10975560	10976560	And I brooked.
10976560	10978560	I was crying so bad.
10978560	10983560	And it was so hard I had to crawl under the porch naked.
10983560	10988560	With all the black winter spiders and I got bit something fierce.
10988560	10994560	Little things are digging into my bare behind all over.
10994560	10998560	I ask you, is that any way to treat a man?
10998560	11011560	And Mrs. Phelps and the sheriff don't make it no easier neither.
11011560	11013560	Where did that broom go?
11013560	11015560	What did he mean?
11015560	11017560	Up and down?
11017560	11024560	Where did it go?
11024560	11025560	Oh, wait.
11025560	11026560	You're right.
11026560	11027560	He's cheating.
11027560	11028560	No, he deserved that.
11028560	11032560	You're right.
11032560	11033560	You're right.
11033560	11034560	You're right.
11034560	11035560	He is a cheater.
11035560	11044560	We don't like, we don't like his kind.
11044560	11050560	Mrs. Phelps down at the general store don't help things, none.
11050560	11053560	She's got them special picture books.
11053560	11055560	The one with the ladies.
11055560	11061560	But she won't sell me none on account of she knows my wife, Mrs. Loomis.
11061560	11065560	That gum that don't burn my bridges.
11065560	11072560	If I even ask about them, she tells Mrs. Loomis and I get the broom.
11072560	11074560	Enough to break a man's heart.
11074560	11077560	Her burning my French postcards.
11077560	11081560	We unable to replace them.
11081560	11083560	We don't like cheaters.
11083560	11087560	You have a wonderful wife.
11087560	11088560	Man's need.
11088560	11095560	Why, you sure ought to appreciate what a man's got to do sometimes in a parked car
11095560	11099560	or waste hide not hole in a tree.
11099560	11100560	A what?
11100560	11101560	A tree?
11101560	11109560	Matter of fact, Mrs. Phelps got no reason not to sell you some of them French postcard
11109560	11111560	girly picture books.
11111560	11116560	If you can get any, it's the clear the park with them.
11117560	11126560	The sheriff's at lunch and I'd be obliged.
11126560	11127560	French postcards.
11127560	11128560	Of course.
11128560	11131560	I don't necessarily mean French postcards.
11131560	11132560	Oh.
11132560	11135560	That's just what we called them in my day.
11135560	11143560	In a kind of girly picture book, the kind men like would be just dandy.
11143560	11148560	I'd be right right, kiddo, if you were to bring me one.
11148560	11149560	That's the hint.
11149560	11150560	Got it.
11150560	11151560	Okay.
11151560	11153560	What if I say fuck?
11153560	11158560	Don't know what you mean, kiddo.
11158560	11159560	Broom?
11159560	11160560	Don't know.
11160560	11161560	Okay, never mind.
11161560	11162560	Bye.
11162560	11163560	Anytime, kiddo.
11173560	11180560	Oh, let's go to diner.
11180560	11186560	1955 frag 100 with a real leather leather seat.
11186560	11199560	Even from the ground, you can hear this sonorous, sonorous, sonorous buzz of neon.
11199560	11202560	Oh, wait, the sheriff's here.
11202560	11203560	Hi.
11203560	11204560	What's your name?
11204560	11205560	Karen.
11205560	11206560	What are you doing?
11206560	11207560	Playing.
11207560	11211560	My mom is working, so I gotta stutter her hair.
11211560	11212560	Wanna play?
11212560	11214560	Not now, maybe later.
11214560	11215560	Okay.
11215560	11216560	Bye-bye.
11216560	11217560	Oh.
11217560	11221560	Why is she the normal one?
11221560	11228560	So nice, so no.
11228560	11231560	Can we get a picture book for the cage?
11231560	11243560	Oh, you want some pretty French postcards for the cage?
11243560	11245560	But be a lower one.
11245560	11246560	Maybe.
11246560	11247560	Maybe.
11247560	11250560	But then Senpai, you're mine.
11250560	11259560	Dude, you only want pretty pictures of me, right?
11259560	11265560	Just me.
11265560	11267560	Good.
11267560	11269560	A coloring book?
11269560	11273560	You want pencil crayons or crayon crayon?
11273560	11286560	Oh, I'm afraid to give my Senpai's crayons though, but you might eat it.
11286560	11293560	You might eat it, just like glue.
11293560	11305560	I knew you would, I knew you would do that, so no coloring books for my Senpai's.
11305560	11312560	None, none, none, none.
11312560	11324560	Oh, she has a nice voice.
11324560	11333560	You know me?
11334560	11336560	I guess I've changed.
11336560	11338560	I'm not kidding.
11338560	11349560	Cheebie!
11349560	11352560	Cheebie!
11352560	11355560	Cheebie!
11355560	11359560	And me!
11359560	11361560	And me and Cheebie!
11361560	11365560	Welcome to the stream!
11365560	11367560	My girls are here.
11367560	11369560	Shut the fuck up!
11369560	11378560	My girls are here!
11378560	11388560	I'm so happy!
11388560	11394560	Wow, how was, how was Call of the Lamb?
11394560	11397560	How was Call of the Lamb?
11397560	11400560	I can't tell, but in me ready to, I didn't see a message.
11400560	11402560	Alright, it's in me just here watching me.
11402560	11409560	Oh, if it's in me just here watching me, I'll be, I'll be a good, I'll be a good.
11409560	11412560	She streamed for like nine hours.
11412560	11417560	Trying to, trying to catch up with Mame.
11417560	11418560	Just watching Cheebie.
11418560	11421560	Make sense, make sense.
11421560	11423560	Hello and good night.
11423560	11424560	Enjoy Harvester.
11424560	11425560	It's such a silly game.
11425560	11426560	Oh, thank you, Cheebie.
11426560	11429560	I didn't read, I just came out from Cheebie's stream.
11429560	11430560	That's no problem.
11430560	11431560	Thank you.
11431560	11432560	Thank you, girlies.
11432560	11435560	The two, two, two blonde girlies.
11435560	11436560	Ten.
11436560	11438560	Oh, yeah.
11438560	11445560	Like Mame, like daughter.
11445560	11458560	I think, I think we all take a bit of Mame's, Mame's aspects.
11458560	11470560	I think we, I think we do.
11470560	11471560	Good night, Cheebie.
11471560	11474560	Talk to you in.
11474560	11477560	What, did you inherit Mercy?
11477560	11480560	They can't, you know, burps.
11480560	11481560	Occasionally.
11481560	11487560	I don't think I have done it yet, but sometimes I do.
11487560	11492560	Good night.
11492560	11497560	I'll always say excuse me though.
11497560	11503560	What else did I inherit?
11503560	11515560	I'll have to ask Mame.
11515560	11517560	A shark, what?
11517560	11519560	Do you think I'm pretty shark?
11519560	11521560	Well, of course I am.
11521560	11531560	Look at these scissors.
11531560	11535560	I don't burp as much as Emi or Mame though.
11535560	11545560	I think I heard Emi say that she can do it on command, and that's really, that's really amazing.
11545560	11547560	That's really amazing.
11547560	11550560	Me on the other hand, I can't do it on command.
11550560	11558560	Anytime that happens, it'll be, it'll be by accident.
11558560	11560560	It's not hard to burp.
11560560	11561560	It's kind of hard for me.
11561560	11565560	I don't like, I can't, like, whistling and can't do it.
11565560	11570560	I can't do it.
11570560	11572560	Well, everyone can burp on command?
11572560	11577560	Am I the only one left out?
11577560	11579560	Could I compete for number one against Mame?
11579560	11586560	You might be able to, Emi.
11586560	11588560	I probably can't.
11588560	11590560	I probably can't.
11590560	11604560	Sometimes mine accidentally gets really loud, but I think it's because when I drink water, the air gets stuck because my uvula is kind of enlarged so it might get caught behind it.
11604560	11607560	That's, that's Ethereum, not quite sure.
11607560	11612560	And then I let out a big one, but I don't think it's a record, but I haven't yet.
11612560	11615560	I sneeze a lot more than I burp though.
11615560	11644560	I never realized it, but after like seeing my, one time seeing my sneeze together, I was like, oh, I sneeze the same way over and over.
11644560	11666560	You breathe in while lifting your palate or something until you hear a little pop and you exhale and burp.
11666560	11673560	I think I just feel coffee from that.
11673560	11674560	Hey, Karen.
11674560	11676560	You've met Karen, my eight year old.
11676560	11677560	Oh, she's so cute.
11677560	11679560	Other than the diner, she's all I have.
11679560	11681560	Oh!
11681560	11687560	No, something bad's gonna happen, I feel it.
11687560	11692560	Ah!
11692560	11695560	Hey, Kohai, what's the tea of the day?
11695560	11710560	Orange ginger.
11710560	11712560	Yeah, I don't think I don't want to burp.
11712560	11713560	Thank you.
11713560	11714560	Let's not burp right now.
11714560	11715560	I don't want to force it.
11715560	11716560	I might get sick.
11716560	11724560	I feel a little sick probably because I've been a little unwell, probably because I've kind of overworked myself.
11724560	11725560	This is an entirely full week.
11725560	11729560	I'm actually probably, I'm thinking I might move a few weeks.
11729560	11733560	Wait, I might feel a burp.
11733560	11738560	Is it working?
11738560	11747560	No, nothing.
11747560	11748560	No, nothing.
11748560	11759560	But yeah, I'm a little sick because I think I've overworked myself a little bit.
11759560	11767560	Because I might lower my schedule for next week because I really need a big break, at least a day of rest.
11767560	11777560	Because even when I'm off streaming, I still have to keep up that social media presence as well.
11777560	11780560	And then I have to think of things and events to do.
11780560	11793560	And then I have to work on my audios and then additional videos if possible.
11793560	11797560	So it doesn't sound like a lot, but it takes a lot of time for all of them.
11797560	11799560	And it takes a lot of energy.
11799560	11801560	It could be due to stress too.
11801560	11805560	I should probably rest up a little more.
11805560	11809560	But I want this tomorrow is the last day of the full week.
11809560	11816560	So hopefully I can find some way to slow down a little bit.
11816560	11821560	So yeah, everyone can see all types of games that I play.
11821560	11823560	Wait, did I talk about Stephanie already?
11823560	11827560	There isn't a nicer girl in Harvest than Stephanie, Steve.
11827560	11830560	You should be grateful that she's promised you her hand.
11830560	11833560	I don't remember that happening, Edna.
11833560	11837560	Honestly, you men are so childish.
11837560	11842560	I don't know what it is about marriage that turns even the bravest man into a coward.
11842560	11847560	I was going to marry Karen's father when he just up and ran out on me one night.
11847560	11848560	We hate him.
11848560	11850560	I heard that he joined the lodge.
11850560	11852560	But if he did, I never saw him come out again.
11852560	11858560	Even Sheriff Dwayne wasn't able to find out what happened to him.
11858560	11863560	Mr. Johnson has a liking for me.
11863560	11867560	I call it a crush, but that's too innocent a word.
11867560	11871560	He's a bitter man with too much time on his hands.
11871560	11874560	He's never gotten over being rejected by the lodge.
11874560	11878560	And there's something unwholesome in the way he looks at me.
11878560	11883560	I'm always glad when the sheriff comes in every day at noon.
11883560	11887560	The lodge is the repository of all wisdom.
11887560	11890560	You should join the order of the Harvest Moon, Steve.
11890560	11892560	And soon.
11892560	11893560	Why?
11893560	11894560	And soon.
11894560	11896560	I'd say, what is it about this place?
11896560	11899560	The wheat ripens and waits not for the sigh.
11899560	11901560	The farmer who waits too long.
11901560	11902560	Wait.
11902560	11906560	He used the sigh to rip his own stomach out then to stay his side when the wheat ripens.
11906560	11909560	The Harvest Moon wanes and then comes winter.
11909560	11910560	An empty belly.
11910560	11911560	The body stands.
11911560	11912560	The body stands, belly.
11912560	11914560	Lurgling within or bloody on the ground.
11914560	11918560	What does it benefit a man if he gains his soul and loses the world?
11918560	11920560	You hunger.
11920560	11922560	Feed yourself.
11922560	11924560	Before it's too late.
11924560	11925560	Late.
11925560	11926560	Oh.
11926560	11928560	What's wrong?
11928560	11930560	Steve.
11930560	11934560	Well, what happened?
11934560	11937560	Were we talking about Boyle?
11937560	11938560	Or was it Karen?
11938560	11940560	You seem strange there for a minute.
11940560	11942560	I'm sorry.
11942560	11944560	I'm under a lot of stress.
11944560	11947560	Running this diner all alone.
11947560	11950560	Forgive me.
11950560	11954560	You've met Karen.
11954560	11955560	Bye.
11955560	11957560	Stop by anytime, Steve.
11957560	11958560	Hello there, Steve.
11958560	11959560	Here for lunch?
11959560	11960560	Yep.
11960560	11961560	No.
11961560	11962560	Just here looking around.
11962560	11965560	Well, I'm not entirely sure where here is.
11965560	11967560	She's under a lot of stress, Boyle.
11967560	11970560	You need a break before you start speaking in tongues.
11970560	11974560	Well, Boyle, this is DNA's diner.
11974560	11975560	Isn't that right, Edna?
11975560	11977560	Don't listen to Sheriff Dwayne.
11977560	11979560	This is Edna's diner.
11979560	11981560	But ever since the E burned out on the sign,
11981560	11983560	they've been giving me a hard time.
11983560	11985560	Now, don't be like that, Edna.
11985560	11988560	It's a great place to eat, which is good.
11988560	11991560	Since it's the only place to eat in harvest.
11991560	11992560	Bye.
11992560	11999560	Stop on by anytime, Steve.
11999560	12003560	Oh, how do I exit?
12003560	12004560	Oh, here it is.
12004560	12005560	Oh, wait.
12005560	12011560	Is there anything else I should look at?
12011560	12019560	Well, the diner people seem nice.
12019560	12021560	Oh, wrong place.
12021560	12028560	I meant to go to the thing.
12028560	12044560	Is he still at the police station?
12044560	12046560	Hold on.
12046560	12062560	Just in case.
12062560	12066560	Here's your girly magazine.
12066560	12071560	Oh, oh, by George.
12071560	12073560	Oh, by Jiminy.
12073560	12080560	Oh, can I have it?
12080560	12081560	Yeah.
12081560	12084560	Oh, thank you, Steve.
12084560	12086560	Excuse me, kiddo.
12086560	12099560	I've got to go check the jail for clean towels.
12099560	12104560	Oh, yeah.
12104560	12108560	Now the evidence room is mine.
12108560	12112560	Never mind.
12112560	12117560	This fairly legible note.
12117560	12121560	Checkbook.
12121560	12128560	Give me the key.
12128560	12155560	Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to click that exit.
12155560	12159560	Give me the stuff.
12159560	12163560	A berry.
12163560	12167560	Arbus brand, old brand of smokes.
12167560	12171560	Where is it?
12171560	12174560	Beer.
12174560	12180560	There it is.
12180560	12183560	Anything else?
12183560	12198560	I didn't work like that, too.
12198560	12201560	Is there anything else?
12201560	12215560	Is there anything else in here?
12215560	12219560	Take the shoes.
12219560	12221560	The bear?
12221560	12224560	Bear is wielding a chainsaw.
12224560	12230560	What's with all these models?
12230560	12232560	There's another woman's body.
12232560	12234560	Oh, I'm surprised.
12234560	12237560	Loomis has painted this evidence.
12237560	12245560	Bottom right here.
12245560	12247560	Hello, Steve.
12247560	12255560	Where's Loomis?
12255560	12259560	Loomis, have you?
12259560	12274560	No.
12274560	12277560	Did I fuck up?
12289560	12297560	Okay, I can go back in again.
12297560	12305560	Is there anything else I can grab?
12305560	12309560	Loomis's light relatives.
12309560	12314560	Prop helps the sheriff meet a ticket quota.
12314560	12337560	Is there anything else in here?
12337560	12343560	Okay, if there's nothing else, let's get out of here.
12343560	12353560	Door's locked.
12353560	12359560	TV station.
12359560	12369560	Sorry, I meant to go to Edna's diner.
12369560	12372560	Oh, he's back here again, okay.
12373560	12390560	Okay, bye.
12390560	12396560	Okay, let's do...
12396560	12401560	Let's go to the TV station.
12401560	12405560	Let's go to the game.
12405560	12407560	As long as we don't fuck up.
12407560	12409560	Oh, I should have just saved into a different one.
12409560	12417560	Too busy drinking and smoking, they ignore you.
12417560	12430560	Oh, they found it here.
12430560	12437560	Steve.
12437560	12438560	Yeah.
12438560	12443560	Yeah, yes.
12443560	12448560	Oh, TV violence.
12448560	12459560	I love all the blood and gore on your show.
12459560	12463560	Here's the commentary.
12463560	12480560	Just look at the net profits.
12480560	12484560	Huh?
12484560	12491560	Very poor reception is strange since the broadcast originates from here.
12491560	12496560	A picture of a gorgeous model signed with a kiss my pineapple.
12496560	12501560	Red and muffy.
12501560	12507560	An assortment of empty cubicles, either McKnight loves to recall his salad days as an insurance salesman.
12507560	12513560	You can't keep up with him, or you can't keep his employees happy.
12513560	12515560	Hey, Sport, this is a private office.
12515560	12518560	Yeah, I know, Mr. McKnight.
12518560	12520560	I own and operate this station.
12520560	12523560	Have you brought me some news for the night broadcast, or...
12523560	12525560	I've lost my memory.
12525560	12526560	That's news.
12526560	12528560	The hell it is.
12528560	12530560	You always were a kid, or Steve.
12530560	12532560	Any real news to tell me?
12532560	12535560	Actually, I was just wanting to know more about the TV station.
12535560	12536560	Huh.
12536560	12540560	Hey, W-H-A-R is the only television station in Harvest.
12540560	12544560	Since the old Sentinel went under, what with the newspaper building burning down and all?
12544560	12545560	We're golden.
12545560	12548560	Nobody competes with us, Sport.
12548560	12552560	Did you burn it down?
12552560	12556560	On Quincet.
12556560	12559560	Hey, now, Sport, that's an irresponsible allegation.
12559560	12561560	I had nothing to do with that fire.
12561560	12566560	Just because W-H-A-R may have benefited from it, and I danced on the ashes a little, doesn't mean...
12566560	12568560	A little?
12568560	12570560	You can share it the way, and give me doubts.
12570560	12574560	You seem awfully touchy on the subject, Sport.
12574560	12578560	I'm touchy when people try to muscle their way into my business.
12578560	12583560	I'd appreciate it if you'd leave my office, and don't come back.
12583560	12584560	No.
12584560	12586560	Don't hurry back.
12592560	12597560	What about the villains?
12597560	12598560	Oh, okay.
12598560	12600560	What's the first choice?
12614560	12616560	Whoa!
12621560	12623560	Godless heathen engines.
12623560	12626560	Most kids don't see godless heathen engines on a regular basis,
12626560	12629560	and if they do, they'd better either get their eyes checked,
12629560	12632560	or do like old range rider, and shoot the bejesus out of them.
12632560	12635560	Lest they want to go untreated for psychotic hallucinations,
12635560	12638560	or wind up with their scalps hanging from a buckskin...
12638560	12639560	YouTube!
12639560	12640560	Shit!
12640560	12641560	Ow!
12641560	12643560	Shit on a sticker room!
12647560	12649560	YouTube, this is part of game!
12649560	12652560	The parents that are griping about violence on TV
12652560	12656560	are the same parents that go outside in the morning to fetch their papers,
12656560	12660560	secure in the knowledge that they won't get an arrow through the noodle,
12660560	12665560	because the violence they hate so much done cleared the engines out of the neighborhood.
12665560	12669560	Yeah, civilization has benefited from violence.
12669560	12672560	But should violence be treated as entertainment?
12672560	12674560	Check my rating, son.
12674560	12676560	Violence is entertainment.
12676560	12678560	I just put it on the air.
12678560	12682560	That says something about the kid, not me.
12682560	12686560	Now, excuse me, we're going back on the air.
12687560	12688560	Alright.
12690560	12693560	Aw, no one's operating the camera.
12695560	12699560	A corny western backdrop complete with a cardboard teepee.
12703560	12704560	Hmm.
12705560	12707560	Either the show isn't compelling,
12707560	12711560	or no one wanted to be taken out by friendly...
12711560	12712560	by friendly fire.
12712560	12715560	A fairly primitive form of mind control.
12729560	12731560	We can exit this way.
12734560	12735560	The meat plant.
12737560	12739560	We should save.
12739560	12742560	I don't know, it seems dangerous to go to a meat plant.
12742560	12745560	What's with... what is that? Are these cats?
12772560	12774560	Cats?
12777560	12779560	Is that a bone?
12802560	12804560	Steve, I didn't want to believe that amnesia hook'em.
12804560	12807560	Now you're saying you don't remember your pal, Pat O'Reilly?
12807560	12809560	Pat O'Reilly, huh?
12809560	12811560	Oh, let's talk about the family business, I guess.
12811560	12813560	Why are they in the meat plant?
12813560	12816560	Because daddy owns the meat plant.
12819560	12822560	You may come to realize that this business is not for everybody.
12822560	12825560	Just ask your poor, ill dad.
12825560	12828560	It takes dedication and a strong stomach.
12833560	12835560	A lot of times, when I'm finished scrubbing up
12835560	12838560	and digging the bits of intestine out from my fingernails,
12838560	12841560	I must confess, I don't have much appetite for red meat.
12841560	12844560	But red meat is one of the principal food groups,
12844560	12846560	and you've got to have it.
12846560	12848560	So when you can do this all day,
12848560	12851560	and help yourself to a juicy red steak afterwards,
12851560	12854560	then by golly, you can call yourself a butcher.
12856560	12857560	Alright!
12857560	12860560	Of course, amnesia would certainly help that, wouldn't it?
12860560	12862560	Dad's on this.
12871560	12873560	Does everyone want to get me into lodge?
12873560	12875560	Amnesia?
12881560	12883560	Kitter count.
12890560	12893560	You're gonna need to start behaving like an adult,
12893560	12896560	especially if you're gonna take over the family business.
12898560	12900560	Family business?
12915560	12917560	Meat?
12921560	12923560	Where do you keep the animals?
12924560	12926560	Does it matter?
12926560	12929560	The end product is all the customer cares about, Steve.
12929560	12931560	And we only carry the finest meat,
12931560	12933560	only the juiciest cuts.
12934560	12936560	What do you use?
12936560	12938560	Once you take over the business,
12938560	12940560	you'll realize the importance of maintaining quality
12940560	12942560	while cutting costs.
12942560	12944560	We know what we're doing.
12944560	12945560	We didn't.
12945560	12947560	Would the lodge use us to cater their affairs?
12954560	12956560	Good. Could I take some meat to take home?
12966560	12968560	Okay, here's a hint.
12968560	12970560	Cutting costs.
12974560	12976560	If you're cutting up the meat, you'll be privy to them.
12976560	12978560	There's always cheaper, better ways to do things.
12978560	12980560	If you're creative.
12980560	12982560	If you're creative?
12984560	12986560	Family business?
13000560	13002560	Goodbye!
13004560	13006560	That's nice, I guess.
13007560	13010560	There are several small animals.
13013560	13015560	This used to be a kitty cat.
13015560	13017560	Okay, we're eating!
13017560	13019560	The plant's eating!
13019560	13021560	Cats understood.
13027560	13029560	Is there anything else in here?
13029560	13031560	Okay, I need a written note.
13034560	13036560	Let me go back to my house.
13042560	13044560	What do I have?
13044560	13046560	Got a pen, newspaper,
13046560	13048560	aspirin,
13048560	13050560	off-medicine,
13050560	13052560	vitamins, tampons.
13052560	13054560	What do I have?
13054560	13056560	I got a pen, newspaper,
13056560	13058560	aspirin,
13058560	13060560	off-medicine, vitamins,
13060560	13062560	tampons,
13062560	13064560	tampons,
13064560	13066560	jar of oralu,
13066560	13068560	shovel,
13068560	13070560	bloody sneakers,
13070560	13072560	gas can,
13072560	13074560	camera,
13074560	13076560	checkbook.
13076560	13078560	What does it say? I can't fucking see!
13078560	13080560	Deposit boil,
13080560	13082560	deposit boil, deposit boil,
13082560	13084560	check,
13084560	13086560	boil,
13086560	13088560	deposit,
13088560	13090560	boil, tulip ammunition,
13090560	13092560	one crate of shells.
13094560	13096560	Oh, it is the war, guys, huh?
13102560	13104560	No, right-click to view.
13104560	13106560	Sheriff, if you think...
13110560	13112560	I'm going to keep paying this...
13116560	13118560	forever.
13118560	13120560	You are crazy. There are limits.
13120560	13122560	Boil.
13122560	13124560	Who's Boil again?
13138560	13140560	Can I use this?
13148560	13150560	Can I use this?
13154560	13156560	Meet permission sleep.
13156560	13158560	Okay.
13176560	13178560	We're saving.
13182560	13184560	Check out the windows.
13184560	13186560	Like at my house?
13194560	13196560	I need...
13196560	13198560	It says fill up head screws.
13198560	13200560	I don't have screw.
13200560	13202560	I don't have a screw unless I use
13202560	13204560	like something irrational,
13204560	13206560	like a shovel.
13206560	13208560	Damn it.
13208560	13210560	See?
13214560	13216560	It'd be hilarious if it worked.
13216560	13218560	Yeah.
13218560	13220560	I don't have a knife.
13226560	13228560	What does this mean?
13230560	13232560	No...
13232560	13234560	Why...
13234560	13236560	Is the Sheriff blackmailing you?
13236560	13238560	That's an interesting item.
13238560	13240560	But the fact that you asked me that question
13240560	13242560	proves you know nothing.
13244560	13246560	I can show these around
13246560	13248560	and prove both of you
13248560	13250560	are guilty of something.
13250560	13252560	You do that, Steve.
13252560	13254560	Not knowing what we're guilty of,
13254560	13256560	how much trouble can you cause?
13256560	13258560	Except for yourself.
13258560	13260560	Oh, yeah?
13260560	13262560	I want to do it again.
13262560	13264560	What does this mean?
13264560	13266560	I know why the Sheriff
13266560	13268560	is blackmailing you.
13268560	13270560	This is unexpected
13270560	13272560	and awkward.
13272560	13274560	But my luck's been bad ever since Dwayne
13274560	13276560	found that darn gas can at the newspaper
13276560	13278560	building the day after the fire.
13278560	13280560	He has this insane notion that it's mine.
13280560	13282560	I pay him not
13282560	13284560	because I'm guilty, but because I don't want
13284560	13286560	him slurring my good name around harvest.
13286560	13288560	Oh, naturally.
13288560	13290560	You know, he keeps that gas can
13290560	13292560	in the evidence room at his office.
13292560	13294560	I'd be really grateful
13294560	13296560	to whoever could fetch me that can.
13296560	13298560	Grateful enough
13298560	13300560	to provide him with a lodge application.
13300560	13302560	Oh, and Steve,
13302560	13304560	you'll keep this to yourself
13304560	13306560	if you're smart.
13310560	13312560	I can trade it,
13312560	13314560	but I want to see what the fingerprints do.
13318560	13320560	Or I don't even have that.
13320560	13322560	Can I figure out if he did it or not?
13326560	13328560	I'm going to do it anyways.
13328560	13330560	Against my better judgment,
13330560	13332560	what do you think, Senpai?
13340560	13342560	We give it...
13342560	13344560	We give it...
13346560	13348560	Yes.
13358560	13360560	You know, this morning
13360560	13362560	as I was making my rounds,
13362560	13364560	I noticed an awful lot of television
13364560	13366560	aerials on the roofs.
13366560	13368560	Seems like more and more each day.
13368560	13370560	You got me this can
13370560	13372560	just in time, youngster.
13372560	13374560	I may have need of it again.
13374560	13376560	What do you mean?
13376560	13378560	There's another reason why Sheriff Dwayne
13378560	13380560	didn't investigate the Sentinel fire.
13380560	13382560	If you'd like to get something else
13382560	13384560	on the black mailing bastard, check around
13384560	13386560	the television station.
13386560	13388560	Why do you still can?
13388560	13390560	Okay.
13390560	13392560	Did I get a launch application thing?
13398560	13400560	Can I use the pen on it?
13400560	13402560	That's a ticket.
13410560	13412560	Can I give this to my brother?
13416560	13418560	Okay.
13422560	13424560	I hope you understand what he means.
13424560	13426560	As in like the...
13428560	13430560	The place is going to go down in flames?
13440560	13442560	Should I...
13442560	13444560	Is there anything at the station
13444560	13446560	that I need or that I missed?
13462560	13464560	Yes?
13468560	13470560	There's an off-shelf thing in the back.
13470560	13472560	Okay.
13472560	13474560	Nothing.
13484560	13486560	What is...
13488560	13490560	Where can I get the...
13492560	13494560	Get it.
13502560	13504560	Okay.
13524560	13526560	Oops.
13526560	13528560	No, no, no.
13528560	13530560	Go back.
13530560	13532560	How do I get the number?
13560560	13562560	This is your first arrest, Steve.
13562560	13564560	You just remember.
13564560	13566560	We've got three strikes.
13566560	13568560	You're out rule here in harvest.
13568560	13570560	But you keep your nose clean.
13570560	13572560	You're here.
13576560	13578560	So I didn't get arrested?
13584560	13586560	Oh, good kiss, good night.
13586560	13588560	And I got tucked in. That's nice.
13590560	13592560	Okay.
13600560	13602560	You're in trouble.
13602560	13604560	How does it feel to be a jailbird?
13606560	13608560	I think it makes you miss out on stuff though.
13608560	13610560	Okay, I'll just...
13610560	13612560	Yeah.
13612560	13614560	What are you yet?
13614560	13616560	You better not get caught against, Steve.
13616560	13618560	You played your get-out jail-free card.
13618560	13620560	Next time, you'll be in...
13622560	13624560	Does that make me miss things?
13624560	13626560	I can just load the game again.
13648560	13650560	Hmm.
13658560	13660560	Hmm.
13662560	13664560	I'm a mar...
13664560	13666560	I'm a mario school.
13678560	13680560	Hmm.
13700560	13702560	Hmm.
13708560	13710560	Quality time.
13716560	13718560	Quality time?
13718560	13720560	I don't know.
13738560	13740560	Who's first name escapes me?
13764560	13766560	Who's first name escapes me?
13768560	13770560	I hear there's an honorary plaque
13770560	13772560	commemorating him
13772560	13774560	within the lodge.
13774560	13776560	Lodge?
13776560	13777560	Big guy.
13777560	13779560	Boring some quality time.
13779560	13782560	The greatest gift I can bestow upon you
13782560	13784560	as your former principal
13784560	13786560	is a word of advice.
13786560	13788560	Join the order
13788560	13790560	of the harvest moon at any cost.
13790560	13792560	Within the lodge
13792560	13794560	lies your future.
13794560	13796560	And without
13796560	13798560	dust.
13802560	13804560	Why do you keep calling me big guy?
13804560	13806560	They sign of respect, lad.
13806560	13808560	As principal, my station is higher
13808560	13810560	than yours now.
13810560	13812560	But you never know what the future holds.
13812560	13814560	So you should always hedge your bets
13814560	13816560	and pay tribute
13816560	13818560	to your inferiors.
13818560	13820560	You know who will come to power.
13820560	13822560	Inferiors? Oh.
13822560	13824560	Even now, wheels sit behind the scenes.
13824560	13826560	For all I know, you might already be a member
13826560	13828560	of the order with access
13828560	13830560	to the lodge.
13830560	13832560	If that were the case, you'd be my superior
13832560	13834560	and I'd be all that much better off
13834560	13836560	having shown you respect
13836560	13838560	and spent some quality
13838560	13840560	time with you.
13842560	13844560	Quality time?
13854560	13856560	Myself, I tip a discipline
13856560	13858560	with love.
13858560	13860560	Oh, love!
13860560	13862560	Love can be such a warm
13862560	13864560	sharing experience.
13864560	13866560	After just a few sessions,
13866560	13868560	you'd stop this amnesia nonsense
13868560	13870560	and become a productive
13870560	13872560	member of society.
13872560	13874560	Oh, love!
13876560	13878560	Okay.
13878560	13880560	Big guy,
13880560	13882560	boring some quality time.
13884560	13886560	Drop in again soon.
13886560	13888560	Adult education is
13888560	13890560	a wonderful thing
13890560	13892560	as is adult quality
13892560	13894560	time.
13894560	13896560	I want some quality time.
13896560	13898560	Last protected fire alarm.
13898560	13900560	Will not let you use
13900560	13902560	the fire alarm.
13902560	13904560	Drinking fountain doesn't work.
13908560	13910560	These lockers are riddled with inexplicable
13910560	13912560	stains and dent.
13912560	13914560	Door is locked.
13914560	13916560	Uh-huh.
13924560	13926560	The children look stunned and zombified.
13930560	13932560	Even the paper cutouts look stunned
13932560	13934560	and zombified.
13934560	13936560	Oh, I don't need to go back in.
13936560	13938560	My goodness.
13938560	13940560	Class, this is Steven.
13940560	13942560	He used to be a student
13942560	13944560	here at Gean Memorial.
13944560	13946560	Say hello, class.
13946560	13948560	They're reticent.
13948560	13950560	The educator's greatest problem
13950560	13952560	today is the apathy of the students.
13952560	13954560	What's wrong with there?
13954560	13956560	It.
13956560	13958560	I can tell you in one word, Steven.
13958560	13960560	Discipline.
13960560	13962560	Goodness, you weren't a sulky bear.
13962560	13964560	You were always a smiley bear.
13964560	13966560	Then...
13966560	13968560	You remember me?
13968560	13970560	Not as such.
13970560	13972560	So many pupils, Steven.
13972560	13974560	They come and they go.
13974560	13976560	But I can always spot those who are nice boys.
13976560	13978560	You can tell from the forehead.
13978560	13980560	The lobes, right, class?
13980560	13982560	I'm glad you stopped by, Steven.
13982560	13984560	Would you care to say a few words to the class
13984560	13986560	about civic responsibility?
13986560	13988560	Not really.
13988560	13990560	I was just passing through.
13990560	13992560	But you must, Steven.
13992560	13994560	A positive role model might be just the thing
13994560	13996560	to inspire these little monsters.
13996560	13998560	Steven, have you any questions for me?
13998560	14000560	Or shall I continue with class?
14002560	14004560	Yes, I do.
14006560	14008560	Harvest.
14008560	14010560	You tell me anything about the harvest.
14010560	14012560	Harvest was founded by the order
14012560	14014560	of the Harvest Moon about 100 years ago.
14014560	14016560	For what purpose?
14016560	14018560	Why, I'm sure you'd have to ask them.
14018560	14020560	You'll find the members of the order at the lodge.
14020560	14022560	Dang!
14022560	14024560	Uh...
14024560	14026560	Lodge.
14044560	14046560	Why is everyone so...
14046560	14048560	Okay!
14048560	14050560	And at some point, should I wait?
14060560	14062560	A baseball bat!
14078560	14080560	If an A-bomb hits,
14080560	14082560	what good is it going to do
14082560	14084560	to duck and cover?
14092560	14094560	Okay, that's fine.
14094560	14096560	Okay, that's fine.
14114560	14116560	Is this why...
14116560	14118560	Yeah, is this why we had memory loss?
14124560	14126560	I was like, oh, this is fine!
14126560	14128560	And then I saw the blood and I was like,
14128560	14130560	this is not fine anymore.
14130560	14132560	Don't buy any time, Steven.
14134560	14136560	Okay.
14136560	14138560	So you don't get to look
14138560	14140560	at what the kids look like? Okay.
14144560	14146560	Okay.
14146560	14148560	Where else did I not go yet?
14148560	14150560	Shad's...
14150560	14152560	Shady, sorry.
14152560	14154560	I was reading it wrong.
14154560	14156560	Shady...
14156560	14158560	I was reading it wrong.
14158560	14160560	Shady...
14160560	14162560	Shady...
14162560	14164560	Shady...
14164560	14166560	Shady...
14166560	14168560	Shady...
14168560	14170560	Shady...
14170560	14172560	Shady...
14172560	14174560	Shady...
14174560	14176560	I was reading it wrong. Shady...
14176560	14178560	Memorial?
14178560	14180560	Those volts of candles
14180560	14182560	have been lit by many well-wishers
14182560	14184560	for the dead or well-wishers
14184560	14186560	with a lot of matches.
14186560	14188560	Those geared to us
14188560	14190560	who have passed recently.
14190560	14192560	Jonathan A. Reigncliff.
14192560	14194560	Kedro for this week's funerary event.
14194560	14196560	I mean, this is an okay place
14196560	14198560	to have the wedding.
14200560	14202560	Oh!
14204560	14206560	It counters this new tube of astraglue.
14214560	14216560	I wanted it.
14216560	14218560	Security.
14218560	14220560	Like what? Money?
14220560	14222560	I'm afraid that's not good enough.
14222560	14224560	I need that glue for my work.
14224560	14226560	You must present me with something
14226560	14228560	significant if you'd have me
14228560	14230560	part with it.
14230560	14232560	Like tampons?
14232560	14234560	I am Daniel Moynihan.
14234560	14236560	Mortician and proprietor
14236560	14238560	of the wayward hotel.
14238560	14240560	Most people ask me why I don't
14240560	14242560	remember their names.
14242560	14244560	Well, you always were a kidder.
14244560	14246560	Another kidder!
14274560	14276560	What losses?
14280560	14282560	Ah, not the PTA.
14304560	14306560	Okay, that sounds suspicious.
14324560	14326560	Okay.
14328560	14330560	Oh, Order of the Harvest Moon?
14330560	14332560	You're a part of it, isn't it?
14334560	14336560	Mm-hmm.
14344560	14346560	Mm-hmm.
14352560	14354560	Thank you, Cole. Hi for housing us in the basement.
14356560	14358560	Do they work at the meat plant?
14358560	14360560	I always said small animals, right?
14364560	14366560	Yeah.
14386560	14388560	When they ran out of cats.
14388560	14390560	There was a lot of cats there.
14390560	14392560	A bake sale?
14394560	14396560	Oh wait, I already said that.
14400560	14402560	Losses?
14420560	14422560	The dead?
14450560	14452560	That's why I put some supplies in barrels.
14476560	14478560	Wayward Hotel.
14480560	14482560	I do my best to accommodate any hobo
14482560	14484560	who straggles into town vacancies permitting.
14490560	14492560	Very charitable of you.
14492560	14494560	Thank you.
14508560	14510560	Can I talk about the Wayward Hotel again?
14514560	14516560	Are the guys who dropped dead staying at your hotel?
14522560	14524560	I can't remember every little
14524560	14526560	Is he lying?
14532560	14534560	Why is everyone saying juicy?
14548560	14550560	Bye.
14552560	14554560	I look
14560560	14562560	Very nasty-looking sink.
14562560	14564560	The fan-wearing blades barely stir the stench-laden air.
14568560	14570560	The needle lies on 33 degrees Fahrenheit.
14574560	14576560	This membered organ,
14576560	14578560	which was never meant to pump a meldehyde.
14578560	14580560	Is there anything else in here?
14594560	14596560	Alright, this isn't salty at all.
14596560	14598560	A lectern for a priest.
14598560	14600560	A hauntingly beautiful stained glass window
14600560	14602560	in which a man holds a scythe
14602560	14604560	in one hand and some ethereal power in the other.
14608560	14610560	A saint kneels before a shepherd.
14610560	14612560	You jubilantly terrified.
14616560	14618560	Is there like a secret thing here?
14626560	14628560	We are in a cult
14628560	14630560	and it's probably run by
14630560	14632560	evil people.
14634560	14636560	Cemetery.
14638560	14640560	I guess we go in.
14644560	14646560	The headstone of this grave
14646560	14648560	site reads Jonathan
14648560	14650560	Jonathan A. Ryan Co-
14650560	14652560	Let's save.
14668560	14670560	Here lies Boxcar Willie.
14672560	14674560	Air reeks of fresh soil manure.
14676560	14678560	Two years in harvest was
14678560	14680560	Two years in harvest was too long.
14680560	14682560	Fear not in death.
14682560	14684560	Montages.
14684560	14686560	Scripture in the headstone has faded.
14688560	14690560	November 27th, 1948.
14690560	14692560	Another unknown visitor.
14692560	14694560	This tombstone is unmarked.
14698560	14700560	You don't know how to use a shovel.
14702560	14704560	Another resting place amongst
14704560	14706560	the graves.
14712560	14714560	What's here?
14714560	14716560	Marvel store have been sealed shut.
14722560	14724560	I don't know.
14730560	14732560	Wrong grave?
14736560	14738560	Well, that didn't work.
14738560	14740560	Okay.
14740560	14742560	Never mind then.
14742560	14744560	Is there anything else?
14750560	14752560	Is there anything else?
14754560	14756560	Maybe the diner?
14756560	14758560	Anything in the diner?
14772560	14774560	Anything in the diner?
14782560	14784560	Oh, it's just me, right?
14784560	14786560	And
14786560	14788560	does not let her customers
14788560	14790560	behind the counter.
14792560	14794560	Bye, bye.
14794560	14796560	Okay, that's a little eerie.
14796560	14798560	Mr. Johnson's house.
14798560	14800560	Johnson?
14814560	14816560	Oh, right here.
14844560	14846560	Oh, okay.
14852560	14854560	Okay.
14856560	14858560	Kidder count.
14874560	14876560	Okay, Edna.
14880560	14882560	What?
14904560	14906560	She needs a good, hard pain.
14906560	14908560	What?
14916560	14918560	I can see why she doesn't like you.
14920560	14922560	I see why she doesn't like you.
14922560	14924560	You're not in this for love.
14924560	14926560	You're in this for other things.
14926560	14928560	How dare you?
14934560	14936560	I...
14942560	14944560	No, he's not in this for love.
14944560	14946560	I can tell.
14946560	14948560	After all, some pies are here because they're in love, right?
14950560	14952560	Well, tell me more about the diner.
14964560	14966560	Okay.
14980560	14982560	Okay, a little bit of whiplash there.
14988560	14990560	That's a little bit of whiplash there.
14990560	14992560	How Stephanie?
14992560	14994560	Oh, yeah, she's fine.
14996560	14998560	Can't we want both things?
14998560	15000560	Of course we can want both things.
15000560	15002560	But you have to want both things.
15002560	15004560	You can't just have...
15004560	15006560	the other thing.
15006560	15008560	Because without love, it's meaningless, right?
15014560	15016560	Speaking of Stephanie,
15016560	15018560	I still haven't gotten an invitation to the wedding yet.
15018560	15020560	I don't have anything to do with that.
15022560	15024560	That's okay.
15024560	15026560	Personally, I'd prefer a pass to the honeymoon.
15028560	15030560	A pass?
15030560	15032560	I could use the backseat of my tucker for the
15032560	15034560	maiden voyage.
15034560	15036560	It's plenty big.
15036560	15038560	Believe you me.
15038560	15040560	I'd drive you around.
15040560	15042560	And I wouldn't look in the backseat.
15042560	15044560	I guarantee it.
15044560	15046560	Though, if you'd like to come up front
15046560	15048560	and take the wheel a while,
15048560	15050560	I wouldn't say name.
15050560	15052560	Mimosa!
15054560	15056560	Also, this man is not allowed
15056560	15058560	at our honeymoon!
15060560	15062560	Mimosa!
15062560	15064560	Welcome to the stream!
15064560	15066560	Welcome!
15068560	15070560	No, but no.
15070560	15072560	I don't want anyone at our honeymoon Senpai.
15072560	15074560	Our honeymoon is very lovely
15074560	15076560	and romantic, okay?
15076560	15078560	This...
15078560	15080560	That is not romantic!
15080560	15082560	Mimosa, welcome to the stream!
15082560	15084560	Welcome!
15084560	15086560	Hello, Raiders!
15086560	15088560	My name is
15088560	15090560	Mercy Modis
15090560	15092560	from Gen 1...
15092560	15094560	No, from
15094560	15096560	Viewers! Gen 1
15096560	15098560	Indulge! Welcome!
15098560	15100560	Right now, we are playing!
15104560	15106560	I'm sorry.
15106560	15108560	I blanked out on the name for a second.
15108560	15110560	Welcome, Mimosa!
15110560	15112560	How was the stream?
15112560	15114560	What were you playing?
15120560	15122560	Sorry, I totally forgot.
15122560	15124560	I blanked out on the name.
15124560	15126560	No, I don't want to be...
15126560	15128560	Our honeymoon can't be here!
15128560	15130560	I remember playing that game.
15130560	15132560	I remember playing
15132560	15134560	Bunny Garden. It was real...
15134560	15136560	It was real fun. Did you like it?
15136560	15138560	Are you liking it?
15142560	15144560	I forgot the order
15144560	15146560	which I had to do it.
15146560	15148560	Welcome, welcome! There might be some
15148560	15150560	such things in this game, so
15150560	15152560	if you're not into the such stuff
15152560	15154560	maybe close your ears.
15154560	15156560	Thank you, Mimosa!
15156560	15158560	I hope you had a good one. Are you heading to bed?
15162560	15164560	I saw a girl with green lace panties.
15164560	15166560	It was amazing.
15166560	15168560	Wait, I played a different Bunny Game!
15168560	15170560	Bunny Garden Game!
15170560	15172560	This one's the new one!
15172560	15174560	With the Bunny! Bunny Girls!
15174560	15176560	Real Bunny Girls!
15176560	15178560	Not anthropomorphic
15178560	15180560	Bunny Girls!
15180560	15182560	Like, you know...
15182560	15184560	Sexy Bunny Girls!
15192560	15194560	Huh?
15200560	15202560	Right? This one's the sexy one!
15202560	15204560	And you can gamble!
15204560	15206560	Right? This is the new one, right?
15206560	15208560	This is the one.
15208560	15210560	The other one's like Bunny Bunny!
15210560	15212560	Am I...
15212560	15214560	I thought it was Bunny Garden.
15214560	15216560	Was it called something else?
15218560	15220560	No, no, no!
15220560	15222560	Uh...
15224560	15226560	Give me a second. Bunny Garden...
15232560	15234560	Sorry, I mistaken the name!
15234560	15236560	Sorry, sorry, sorry! I mistaken the name!
15236560	15238560	The game I was playing was called
15238560	15240560	the Bunny Graveyard!
15242560	15244560	There was a bit of gardening in it!
15250560	15252560	Ha ha ha ha!
15254560	15256560	Ha ha ha ha!
15258560	15260560	There's a different location!
15260560	15262560	We did garden!
15262560	15264560	We did garden in there!
15268560	15270560	Graveyard Garden!
15270560	15272560	Same difference! They have dirt in them!
15272560	15274560	You know?
15278560	15280560	The same!
15280560	15282560	You still talked about sexy anthropomorphic bunnies!
15282560	15284560	Oh, no, no, no!
15284560	15286560	I meant like this one is anthropomorphic bunnies!
15286560	15288560	Bunny Garden, the other one,
15288560	15290560	is sexy bunnies!
15290560	15292560	Like Playboy bunnies!
15292560	15294560	But we don't say Playboy because we can get sued!
15294560	15296560	Ha ha ha ha!
15302560	15304560	But nice! Green panties!
15304560	15306560	I don't even think I have green panties!
15306560	15308560	What color are my panties?
15310560	15312560	No, they're bears! I forgot!
15312560	15314560	Yeah, they're bears! Ha ha ha ha ha!
15318560	15320560	Mercy, you kill me!
15320560	15322560	No...
15322560	15324560	No...
15324560	15326560	No...
15326560	15328560	Because Mimosa...
15328560	15330560	You slay!
15330560	15332560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
15332560	15334560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
15350560	15352560	Ah!
15352560	15354560	Look at me! Look at me, senpais!
15354560	15356560	I have ribs!
15356560	15358560	Right? I have ribs!
15360560	15362560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
15364560	15366560	Okay...
15366560	15368560	Don't...
15368560	15370560	Don't point out how long I've been wearing the same panties
15370560	15372560	for a doll!
15372560	15374560	Why are you keeping track anyways, huh?
15376560	15378560	We're gonna...
15378560	15380560	Shut up!
15382560	15384560	Yeah, I got the ribs!
15384560	15386560	So now...
15386560	15388560	Clearly!
15388560	15390560	Clearly, Mimosa
15390560	15392560	wants to be my best friend forever, right?
15392560	15394560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
15396560	15398560	Well, you did say you hadn't
15398560	15400560	showered in days openly.
15400560	15402560	Well, my water's not exactly
15402560	15404560	in...
15404560	15406560	proper condition.
15406560	15408560	And it was just yesterday!
15408560	15410560	I showered yesterday! It's fine!
15410560	15412560	I think...
15412560	15414560	Actually...
15418560	15420560	Call me!
15422560	15424560	Mimosa!
15424560	15426560	You can slide into my DMs
15426560	15428560	anytime, don't worry.
15432560	15434560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
15436560	15438560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
15440560	15442560	Listen, girls!
15442560	15444560	The... the corporal girls, they don't...
15444560	15446560	They don't have...
15446560	15448560	They don't get to go in the cage. They have...
15448560	15450560	free access.
15450560	15452560	Oh, they don't have to stay.
15452560	15454560	They can stay if they want.
15454560	15456560	They have free access to come and go as they please.
15456560	15458560	Yeah.
15458560	15460560	Yeah.
15460560	15462560	Mm-hmm.
15462560	15464560	I can't believe there is work.
15464560	15466560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
15466560	15468560	Discrimination!
15468560	15470560	Don't get me wrong, Senpai!
15470560	15472560	Don't get me wrong!
15472560	15474560	It's not like I don't trust you,
15474560	15476560	but there's many times
15476560	15478560	in which I question the validity
15478560	15480560	of your words.
15480560	15482560	So that's why sometimes
15482560	15484560	the girls help me.
15484560	15486560	And then they help me clean up as well.
15486560	15488560	Ha ha ha ha ha!
15494560	15496560	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
15500560	15502560	Remember
15502560	15504560	when you didn't put
15504560	15506560	my Oshi mark in your name, Senpai?
15508560	15510560	Remember when you said
15510560	15512560	that you didn't love me?
15512560	15514560	There's so many moments like that,
15514560	15516560	and I always give second chances.
15516560	15518560	More than checking chances.
15518560	15520560	At this point, it seems to be like
15520560	15522560	my endless amount of chances.
15522560	15524560	I'm so nice!
15528560	15530560	I'm so nice!
15530560	15532560	And all this time,
15532560	15534560	what do I get?
15534560	15536560	Not even my Oshi mark in your name.
15540560	15542560	I am so nice.
15542560	15544560	I give you a television in your cage.
15544560	15546560	I give you one happy meal
15546560	15548560	to share with everyone.
15550560	15552560	I give you five minutes of free time
15552560	15554560	so you even get to have some
15554560	15556560	some fun in there.
15556560	15558560	Come on!
15560560	15562560	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
15564560	15566560	So, Senpai's.
15568560	15570560	Senpai, Senpai's.
15570560	15572560	Now that you have it,
15572560	15574560	you have to earn my trust again.
15574560	15576560	You have to earn my trust again.
15576560	15578560	Because if I see you next day
15578560	15580560	without my Oshi mark,
15580560	15582560	we're going to have a lot of serious talking.
15582560	15584560	And by serious talking, I mean
15584560	15586560	perhaps talking where
15586560	15588560	you are met by the end of a shovel.
15588560	15590560	The spade side.
15594560	15596560	All right.
15600560	15602560	All right.
15608560	15610560	So that's all.
15610560	15612560	No ifs, and buts, and besides.
15612560	15614560	Besides.
15614560	15616560	The girls know how to keep a secret.
15618560	15620560	And, okay.
15620560	15622560	And, and
15622560	15624560	the cage
15624560	15626560	and the basement is my place
15626560	15628560	and your place, okay?
15628560	15630560	It's our private sanctuary.
15630560	15632560	It's our private sanctuary.
15632560	15634560	I mean we'll also come for visits of course
15634560	15636560	but otherwise, it's our private sanctuary.
15638560	15640560	All right.
15640560	15642560	Okay.
15652560	15654560	It's our private sanctuary.
15654560	15656560	Although if mimosa wants to be called Senpai
15656560	15658560	then you know
15658560	15660560	she would have
15660560	15662560	to share the McDonald's meal too.
15662560	15664560	Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
15670560	15673880	And then we'll have a wedding all together!
15673880	15675560	Hahahahaha!
15675560	15677560	No!
15677560	15680560	Then special privileges it is.
15682560	15684560	It's tomorrow Happy Meal Day or Monday.
15684560	15688560	It's once a month and I've already given the Happy Meal.
15688560	15691560	Anyways, let's continue on this.
15691560	15694560	I don't want to know but we're going to ask about Tucker.
15697560	15699560	Heck of an automobile, isn't she?
15700560	15705560	Damn shame I have to sit out here and watch over her all the time.
15705560	15710560	But if I didn't, those stupid kids might scratch her up playing ball.
15715560	15717560	Can I take a look at it?
15731560	15736560	A few months back someone broke into my house, trying to get into the garage.
15736560	15743560	I had to gripe my car before the sheriff agreed to start the evening patrols and instigate the curfew.
15760560	15782560	Only 51 cars were made, including their prototype, before the company was forced to declare bankruptcy and cease all operations on March 3, 1949 due to negative publicity initiated by the news media.
15783560	15784560	Let's see.
15784560	15793560	A Securities Exchange Commission investigation heavily publicized stock fraud trial in which the allegations for proven baseless and led to full acquittal.
15793560	15803560	Tucker suspected that big three automakers, Mexican Senator Homer S. Ferguson had a role in the Tucker corporation's demise.
15804560	15807560	So what, they didn't like the car or something?
15808560	15817560	Alright, okay, so I guess this car is really rare and that's why it's expensive? Okay.
15819560	15822560	I mean, that's why he cares about it so much, got it.
15827560	15828560	Why now?
15829560	15835560	During the day, Mr. Johnson keeps watch over his precious 48 Tucker.
15838560	15847560	Sorry, Steve. Too tired to talk right now. I just gave the Tucker a tune up. I'll talk to you later.
15848560	15849560	Okay, bye.
15854560	15856560	Okay, so this is an expensive car.
15860560	15863560	Or, well, a car that's very...
15864560	15865560	Am I missing something?
15865560	15868560	Where do I get a screwdriver, some pie?
15868560	15869560	Pie.
15888560	15897560	It's during the day he sits out there, but when he goes to the diner, is the car, you know, car?
15899560	15903560	A screwdriver store, shut up.
15916560	15917560	Does my house have one?
15929560	15934560	I won't be able to get the screwdriver today or tomorrow.
15936560	15937560	But why not?
15941560	15942560	Why not?
15944560	15946560	You want this autograph?
15949560	15951560	Actually, never mind. You're a brat.
15959560	15960560	You're a brat.
15974560	15975560	Big whoopsie.
15976560	15977560	Never mind.
15985560	15986560	I guess?
15989560	15994560	Yeah, me didn't fucking care.
15995560	15996560	I guess?
15997560	15999560	Did I write out the completed lodge?
16003560	16004560	I guess?
16005560	16011560	If I'm done everything, I can go to the lodge and be like, here you go!
16012560	16013560	Right?
16019560	16020560	Oh, where is it?
16026560	16028560	Oh, right. Wrong game.
16030560	16031560	Here you go.
16036560	16037560	Yeah.
16048560	16049560	Assignment.
16052560	16054560	Oh, am I done for the day?
16061560	16065560	Look at the graphics, must have been like super great back then.
16073560	16075560	Why are you taking off your shirt, Steve?
16078560	16083560	Put on a shirt, you're gonna catch it cold.
16085560	16088560	That voice will always be hilarious.
16089560	16092560	Oh, yeah. Is this funny, Jill?
16094560	16095560	What's going on here?
16104560	16105560	Burger?
16108560	16110560	What's going on here?
16133560	16135560	I was like there was just a burger there.
16135560	16138560	Anything that's suddenly in my thingy?
16145560	16148560	Obviously some fat high school girl left it here.
16148560	16149560	What the...
16151560	16152560	Dipper dolls.
16154560	16155560	Anything else?
16155560	16156560	No.
16159560	16161560	What do you want, Steve?
16163560	16164560	Still sick, huh?
16166560	16167560	Alright.
16174560	16175560	You wanna go?
16178560	16180560	You wanna go, little bro?
16186560	16187560	Okay, dad.
16191560	16193560	Is he feeling better?
16195560	16199560	You know what? Fuck you.
16201560	16202560	Goodbye.
16203560	16205560	Aw, man, I wanna kick Kim in.
16210560	16211560	newborn baby.
16217560	16218560	Dad?
16218560	16219560	Dad?
16229560	16230560	Is there anything else?
16231560	16233560	Cookies? More cookies.
16239560	16241560	You forgot to have fun with mom yesterday.
16243560	16244560	So...
16248560	16251560	You want me to fuck mom?
16252560	16255560	Is that what you're saying? To do my ma'am?
16259560	16261560	I think I got a paper yesterday.
16269560	16271560	I think I have a paper from yesterday.
16272560	16275560	Yeah, I have a paper from yesterday.
16275560	16278560	Oh, hi. What? The game loves you!
16281560	16283560	See, she's like naughty words.
16283560	16286560	So I just put in a lot of naughty words, okay? Here.
16290560	16291560	See?
16291560	16293560	And not me! The game says it.
16305560	16310560	See? See, it's not me! The game says so.
16321560	16324560	Okay, hold on. I got your paper, boy.
16325560	16327560	There now. See how easy it is?
16328560	16332560	Things are so much better between us when you remember the paper in the morning.
16332560	16334560	And let's keep it that way.
16334560	16337560	I feel like this kid's gonna grab a gun at me or something.
16337560	16339560	Or stab me.
16348560	16350560	I didn't think that would happen.
16352560	16355560	I didn't think it would happen, but it did!
16361560	16363560	I knew it!
16364560	16366560	I knew it was strapped!
16368560	16370560	I knew it!
16373560	16375560	I knew it!
16385560	16387560	I knew it!
16390560	16393560	Can I punch him to death though? Is that a possibility?
16395560	16398560	I don't want to do this, but...
16401560	16403560	No, okay. It's only an outside thing.
16407560	16410560	It's possible, but very difficult.
16417560	16420560	It's just a really long time of punching.
16420560	16422560	The kid didn't even hesitate!
16424560	16427560	Can I kill the kid myself?
16430560	16433560	Whatever. We're gonna play a friendly relation for now.
16433560	16435560	For now.
16443560	16447560	Hey Steve, you've been doing a swell job putting the paper out in the morning.
16447560	16451560	You just keep doing that and we won't have any problems.
16451560	16454560	Yeah, yeah, whatever kid.
16459560	16462560	Where should I go to first? The lodge, right?
16471560	16473560	Yeah, I guess.
16474560	16476560	Yeah, I want to know what you know.
16482560	16484560	Okay.
16492560	16494560	Yeah, what kind of tasks?
16494560	16496560	Minor pranks!
16511560	16515560	There is, in harvest, a man named Mr. Johnson.
16515560	16520560	He owns a Tucker. It is his pride and joy.
16520560	16524560	I should like you to put a scratch in it.
16524560	16526560	A scratch? That's all?
16526560	16529560	As I said, a minor prank.
16529560	16533560	Mind you, you're not to damage the vehicle.
16533560	16536560	Really put a single scratch in it.
16536560	16539560	Once you have done so, return here.
16539560	16543560	And I shall give you your next task.
16543560	16546560	Okay, so I put a scratch on it.
16554560	16556560	Okay.
16562560	16564560	Do I...
16565560	16567560	What do I do? Okay.
16568560	16571560	If I do it right in front of him, he'll fucking kill me, right?
16571560	16573560	That's my guess.
16576560	16578560	What if...
16578560	16581560	What if I even use the scratch?
16581560	16583560	Shawty.
16584560	16586560	I want this.
16588560	16590560	I don't have money.
16591560	16593560	Hello, Steve. Care to buy anything?
16593560	16595560	No, thanks.
16597560	16599560	I'll be happy to help you.
16599560	16601560	Okay, thank you.
16604560	16606560	Oh, do I key a car?
16608560	16610560	Where can I get a key?
16621560	16624560	Maybe with the screwdriver? Where do I get the screwdriver?
16627560	16629560	Is he here?
16629560	16631560	He's not here.
16648560	16650560	Newspaper building.
16650560	16652560	Newspaper building.
16656560	16658560	Check the old man's garage.
16659560	16661560	This guy?
16665560	16667560	Sorry, Steve.
16668560	16670560	Bye now.
16674560	16677560	Can I go into his house?
16680560	16682560	Ew, okay.
16684560	16686560	I wonder if Stephanie has anything to say.
16686560	16688560	Oh, you're right.
16688560	16690560	I totally forgot about Stephanie.
16690560	16693560	I forgot! We have a wedding!
16698560	16701560	Yes, I... No, I haven't seen him.
16710560	16712560	Aw.
16720560	16722560	Aw.
16722560	16724560	Wait, no, I shouldn't say aww.
16724560	16726560	You, you, you are dirty!
16730560	16732560	Okay.
16732560	16734560	But also, fuck you.
16734560	16736560	Not like in...
16736560	16738560	You forgot about your wife? Sure did.
16738560	16740560	You moved the people?
16746560	16748560	He didn't move the people!
16756560	16758560	Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
16758560	16761560	What did I say about the fucking people, huh?
16762560	16764560	You little shit.
16765560	16769560	I gave you one thing, and you didn't even do it!
16769560	16771560	Are you peeping caught?
16771560	16774560	Listen, I wanted to check if it was still there.
16774560	16776560	I wanted to check if it was still there.
16779560	16782560	Steve, I'm so glad you came back.
16782560	16784560	What have you been doing?
16784560	16786560	I visited the lodge.
16786560	16788560	Talked to the sergeant at arms there.
16789560	16791560	He knows that there's something out of whack here.
16791560	16795560	He told me if I wanted to find out what it is, I should join the lodge.
16795560	16798560	I've decided to join the lodge, Stephanie.
16798560	16801560	I think the answer to all our questions is inside.
16801560	16803560	That place.
16803560	16805560	It's so sinister.
16807560	16809560	Maybe, but I've got to join anyways.
16809560	16811560	You may be playing right into their hands.
16811560	16813560	Did you think of that?
16813560	16816560	Doesn't it seem like you're being hurted toward the lodge?
16816560	16819560	It's one of the things I hope to find out.
16819560	16822560	I hope finding out doesn't get you killed.
16824560	16826560	Come back and visit me soon.
16826560	16828560	Okay?
16828560	16830560	Okay.
16835560	16837560	Oi, that peephole!
16839560	16841560	Hole!
16849560	16851560	I guess.
16857560	16859560	Hmm.
16863560	16866560	You might want to be extra nice to Mr. Potson today.
16866560	16869560	Guess we're having a wedding at Mr. Moynihan's after all.
16871560	16873560	Give my regards to your parents.
16873560	16875560	Hmm.
16876560	16877560	You!
16877560	16879560	Hole!
16881560	16883560	My garage needs a new paint job.
16893560	16895560	I need a key. Where do I get a key?
16895560	16897560	I need a key.
16904560	16909560	Kittle, you brought me any of them girly picture books?
16909560	16911560	No, sorry.
16911560	16913560	Oh heck.
16913560	16919560	Why should you be any different from the sheriff or Mrs. Loomis?
16920560	16928560	Dave, I'd be right obliged if you could just seek Claire to bring in me just one of them books.
16928560	16930560	Believe me.
16930560	16932560	I already got your book!
16932560	16936560	I already got your one! What happened to the last one?
16939560	16942560	Wait, you're just going to let me look at it?
16943560	16945560	Can I do that again?
16946560	16948560	It just lets me?
16955560	16957560	It just lets me now?
16963560	16965560	Alright.
16965560	16970560	I'm a little nervous about it, but I guess it just does.
16976560	16980560	Alright, just don't mind me, officer.
16980560	16983560	I'm just going in.
16986560	16989560	I thought you were going to be burnt down already.
16995560	16996560	Bye.
17006560	17011560	Anything to stretch the car?
17011560	17013560	Have a shovel.
17028560	17030560	What's this?
17030560	17034560	A manhole key is stuck on the top of the manhole cover.
17034560	17036560	Can I take that?
17047560	17049560	Okay, bye.
17058560	17063560	Could you use the shovel and the manhole key? Why would I use the shovel and the manhole key?
17063560	17065560	Well, that didn't work.
17069560	17072560	Anything I can get to get it?
17074560	17076560	A lube.
17086560	17089560	Wait, was that not enough lube?
17090560	17092560	Oh, thank you.
17093560	17095560	Thank you.
17103560	17106560	Wait, what do you mean I thought it sense?
17112560	17114560	Wait, what?
17114560	17116560	Was that the game?
17123560	17126560	I do remember there's...
17126560	17129560	Oh, that seems dangerous. Hold on.
17129560	17131560	Let's grab this.
17148560	17151560	Was that all I had to do today?
17153560	17155560	Okay.
17159560	17162560	The rest of the grate is bolted to the damp floor.
17162560	17166560	Cold and moisture has formed along the surface of the wheel valve.
17166560	17168560	Can I use it?
17172560	17174560	What about this?
17174560	17177560	Small section of the hull has been resealed due to the water damage.
17183560	17185560	What about this?
17189560	17191560	Bolted.
17192560	17194560	Well, that didn't work.
17194560	17196560	Oh, man. Well, that didn't work.
17196560	17198560	Damn it.
17199560	17201560	What do I do now?
17208560	17210560	Is that just to go back up?
17210560	17212560	Okay.
17224560	17227560	Does that mean I have the brake in again?
17231560	17233560	Oh, man.
17241560	17243560	What do I need?
17243560	17245560	What do I need?
17249560	17251560	The walls down here?
17253560	17256560	Oh, there's a tiny indentation in the concrete.
17259560	17261560	Can I use the shovel?
17271560	17273560	Never mind, we got it.
17278560	17280560	Wow, wow!
17283560	17286560	Empty oil can slither before.
17287560	17291560	A large oil pan filled with lugs and bolts.
17295560	17297560	Oh.
17297560	17299560	Okay.
17300560	17302560	What's down here?
17310560	17313560	Mr. Johnson has a myriad of goodies on his tool bench.
17313560	17315560	Can I grab some?
17318560	17320560	Flashlight missing batteries.
17321560	17325560	Gas can similar to the model to the Postmaster's gas can.
17326560	17328560	Rubber mallet.
17329560	17331560	Ain't nothing but sawdust.
17331560	17333560	I was hoping he'd have a screwdriver.
17333560	17335560	Ducca ducca ducca ducca.
17336560	17338560	Oh, wait. No.
17338560	17340560	There it is.
17356560	17358560	Is there anything else here?
17361560	17363560	The edge to the side of the blowtorch reads,
17363560	17365560	Thinking of you, Edna.
17367560	17369560	How do I scratch this car?
17369560	17372560	Do I scratch it with the screwdriver?
17372560	17374560	Did it.
17374560	17376560	Get the fuck out of here.
17403560	17405560	Wait, can I cover the manhole?
17408560	17410560	Can I cover the manhole again?
17412560	17414560	Ah, man. Ah, man.
17415560	17417560	Yeah.
17417560	17419560	Fuck out of here.
17420560	17422560	Guess we go back to the lodge.
17426560	17430560	So, you have completed your first task.
17430560	17432560	Peace.
17432560	17434560	Now that you've scratched the ducca,
17434560	17437560	you may proceed to your second task.
17437560	17441560	You will steal a bolt of fabric from the fireman,
17441560	17444560	and bring it to me.
17450560	17453560	I see, then the lodge is comprised of thieves.
17453560	17458560	The human mind always seeks to categorize phenomena.
17459560	17460560	Okay.
17460560	17462560	Uh-huh.
17462560	17464560	Uh-huh.
17489560	17491560	Meet again, huh?
17509560	17512560	Okay, I guess it's my day over?
17514560	17516560	Right, he talks a lot.
17516560	17518560	I guess we have to get the mob now.
17519560	17521560	Oh, I like the fireman's.
17524560	17525560	Well, that was fast.
17525560	17527560	I saw that faster than I thought.
17537560	17539560	Way faster than I thought, actually.
17547560	17551560	I just don't know why he's always got to be shirtless.
17554560	17558560	Does he go to bed with his watch on to use some pie?
17560560	17563560	I have, like, a kamigachi watch.
17571560	17572560	Oh, you're right.
17572560	17574560	He sleeps in jeans.
17575560	17578560	Many people would sleep with their Apple Watches nowadays
17578560	17580560	because the tracks sleep.
17581560	17583560	That's a bit luxurious for me.
17583560	17586560	Taddle shoes with laces knotted together.
17586560	17588560	Taddle shoes.
17589560	17590560	What's that?
17590560	17591560	I don't know.
17591560	17592560	I don't know.
17592560	17593560	I don't know.
17593560	17594560	I don't know.
17594560	17595560	I don't know.
17595560	17596560	I don't know.
17596560	17597560	I don't know.
17597560	17598560	I don't know.
17598560	17599560	I don't know.
17599560	17600560	I don't know.
17600560	17601560	I don't know.
17602560	17603560	What's that?
17604560	17606560	Recently watered plastic plant.
17613560	17614560	Gotta get a paper.
17616560	17617560	Don't leave without it.
17617560	17619560	I said, don't leave without it.
17619560	17620560	Let's talk to your brother.
17621560	17623560	The dad feeling better?
17631560	17633560	Pot holder on her knees.
17633560	17634560	Reaching for him.
17634560	17637560	How can she do the stitches on him wearing those?
17637560	17639560	Wouldn't she slip?
17639560	17640560	Don't be silly.
17640560	17641560	She wouldn't do that.
17641560	17642560	Of course she'd slip.
17642560	17644560	Maybe that's why he's not getting better.
17644560	17646560	I heard that someone took Karen.
17646560	17649560	Little Miss Perfect was famous.
17649560	17652560	Gonna do a picture on her milk carton.
17652560	17653560	Yeah.
17653560	17655560	Well, I heard that Karen was gone.
17655560	17658560	So I went over to Miss Fitzgerald's house
17658560	17661560	and asked if I could play with Karen.
17663560	17667560	And I just stood there, you know, in the doorway
17667560	17670560	and cried and cried.
17670560	17672560	And I just stood there.
17672560	17674560	Punch my brother.
17674560	17676560	I don't know what take for her to stop.
17676560	17678560	But she didn't.
17680560	17682560	So I went inside and watched TV
17682560	17684560	because they've got color.
17684560	17686560	I thought you said you never heard of color.
17686560	17689560	Because she runs the diner and all.
17689560	17692560	And I've said she was feeling vulnerable.
17692560	17696560	So I asked her to fix me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
17696560	17697560	And she...
17697560	17698560	I'm gonna kill this kid.
17698560	17700560	Then I went into Karen's bedroom
17700560	17702560	and looked around for stuff I could take
17702560	17705560	while Edna was in the bathroom with the water running.
17705560	17706560	What?
17706560	17709560	But all that there was was pearl stuff.
17709560	17711560	So I came home.
17711560	17714560	But it was fun while it lasted.
17716560	17718560	You're evil.
17726560	17728560	Why is my brother off track?
17734560	17736560	Gosh, I wanna punch you.
17736560	17739560	Why can't I go over there and punch him myself?
17747560	17749560	Oops.
17755560	17756560	What?
17763560	17765560	What day did she disappear?
17770560	17771560	Tuesday.
17771560	17772560	Okay.
17777560	17780560	Wait, have I checked on my little sister yet?
17780560	17782560	Is my little sister even real?
17789560	17791560	What is wrong with that kid?
17791560	17793560	I hate kids.
17801560	17803560	Hold on.
17807560	17808560	What? Why?
17808560	17810560	Yeah, I did. Why?
17812560	17814560	What are we training?
17829560	17831560	Okay, sure. Take the sneakers.
17836560	17838560	Okay.
17851560	17853560	Don't you need the paper?
17853560	17854560	Paper?
17864560	17865560	Okay, you wanna go save Karen?
17865560	17867560	Yeah, I wanna go save Karen.
17867560	17869560	She seems like a sweet girl.
17870560	17872560	Wait a second.
17872560	17875560	Oh, so when did he talk about...
17875560	17877560	Okay, hold on.
17877560	17879560	Let's grab this.
17884560	17887560	Like, most security devices there
17887560	17890560	is usually more than one trap to stop intruders.
17890560	17893560	No!
17893560	17895560	When did I save?
17897560	17899560	What was the last time I saved?
17910560	17912560	Shit!
17914560	17917560	This is your first arrest, Steve.
17923560	17925560	Aw, man.
17938560	17941560	Next time I gotta save more.
17944560	17947560	Oh! It led me all the way here!
17949560	17951560	Son of a bitch.
17973560	17975560	Give me... Give me...
17975560	17977560	Right, go through the...
17980560	17982560	Wait a second.
17983560	17985560	A dependent poster?
17985560	17989560	Aided poster is a 1948 Sexiest Tomboy Award.
17989560	17991560	Tomboy, huh?
17997560	17999560	Did it.
18003560	18005560	No, no.
18029560	18031560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
18031560	18034440	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, you know what? Now we save again.
18042200	18043320	Oh my gosh.
18053000	18059640	Some pies. Are you saying that you like tomboy? Am I not tomboy enough for you?
18062520	18063560	More of you.
18065560	18067560	I hear tomboy.
18067560	18069560	I hear you.
18071560	18073560	Then I...
18073560	18075560	Uh-huh.
18075560	18077560	Mom says...
18077560	18079560	Good.
18079560	18081560	Oh, you go back here. Talk to mom again.
18081560	18083560	Hello, dear. By the way, it is...
18085560	18087560	This happened.
18087560	18089560	Don't forget to put...
18107560	18109560	Hmm, okay.
18109560	18111560	Now I talk to him.
18111560	18113560	Hey, did you...
18113560	18115560	Yes, I did.
18115560	18117560	You know this...
18117560	18119560	Take the sneakers.
18119560	18121560	Swirl.
18121560	18123560	And also the paper.
18131560	18133560	How do I get the alarm out then?
18137560	18139560	Hmm...
18139560	18141560	What's my definition of a tomboy?
18155560	18157560	Masculine traits?
18169560	18171560	Huh.
18173560	18175560	Okay.
18175560	18177560	How do we save her?
18177560	18179560	How do I... Fuck.
18191560	18195560	The alarm is in the living room, but your brother's a jerk.
18195560	18197560	I can try to get rid of that.
18199560	18201560	Oh, my God.
18201560	18203560	I want to kill him.
18229560	18231560	Where did she go?
18231560	18233560	I can't stop and chat, Steve.
18233560	18235560	With Karen gone, if I stop, I think I'll lose my mind.
18235560	18237560	I've got to keep busy.
18237560	18239560	Busy.
18239560	18241560	Excuse me.
18241560	18243560	I just heard that Mr. Johnson's tucker was vandalized.
18243560	18245560	You know, though I don't like to think ill of people
18245560	18247560	or take pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
18247560	18249560	I'd like to think it's a comeuppance
18249560	18251560	for all the people that I've met.
18251560	18253560	I've got to keep busy.
18253560	18255560	Busy.
18255560	18257560	Excuse me.
18257560	18259560	I'd like to think it's a comeuppance
18259560	18261560	for all the times that nasty man has bothered me.
18265560	18267560	I can't do it yet.
18287560	18289560	Yeah, let's check with Stephanie.
18301560	18303560	Oh, shit, wrong place.
18307560	18309560	Potsdam.
18309560	18311560	Did you say hello to your...
18311560	18313560	No, I haven't seen him yet.
18315560	18317560	His daughter, Karen, is missing.
18317560	18319560	How could anyone do something so terrible to her?
18319560	18321560	You think someone took her?
18321560	18323560	I think.
18323560	18325560	Oh, no, see, it was a kidnapping.
18325560	18327560	Haven't you heard?
18327560	18329560	The sheriff got a ransom note.
18329560	18331560	It seems someone wants to dip into Edna's lauder.
18331560	18333560	Too bad.
18333560	18335560	Such a bad thing.
18335560	18337560	I'm sorry.
18337560	18339560	Too bad such a sweet little thing
18339560	18341560	has to suffer.
18343560	18345560	Where were you Tuesday night?
18347560	18349560	That was a terrible night.
18349560	18351560	Our upstairs toilet backed up.
18351560	18353560	Pete Swell came over and fixed it.
18355560	18357560	My back still soar
18357560	18359560	from helping me carry his stuff up the stairs.
18361560	18363560	Someone went and scraped up Johnson's car?
18363560	18365560	Can you imagine?
18367560	18369560	He'd step in a bear trap
18369560	18371560	and chew his own leg off
18371560	18373560	rather than suffer a scratch.
18373560	18375560	Tucker serves the rich bastard right.
18375560	18377560	Okay, we're going all over the place.
18385560	18387560	Was Johnson behind the alibi?
18387560	18389560	I'm gonna just ask her.
18391560	18393560	Steve.
18393560	18395560	I'm sorry.
18395560	18397560	Want to hear what's happening out in the real world?
18397560	18399560	No.
18399560	18401560	I'd rather forget about Harvest for a while.
18403560	18405560	Come here.
18407560	18409560	What?
18411560	18413560	Stephanie.
18413560	18415560	I feel so close to you, Steve.
18417560	18419560	Like we're the only two people in Harvest.
18419560	18421560	The only two real people.
18421560	18423560	Do you know what I mean?
18423560	18425560	Do you know what I mean?
18429560	18431560	Yes?
18431560	18433560	I need to feel something again.
18433560	18435560	The sense I have that I've known you.
18435560	18437560	It's my only link to my past.
18439560	18441560	Yeah?
18441560	18443560	Maybe it's different than memory.
18443560	18445560	Okay, at least they just hold hands.
18445560	18447560	Yeah!
18447560	18449560	I had a nervous moment.
18449560	18451560	Strong feelings.
18451560	18453560	I'm so emo.
18453560	18455560	You would be too if you were all late.
18471560	18473560	Should I?
18475560	18477560	Should I do it, Chad?
18481560	18483560	I mean, surprise!
18489560	18491560	Then take me.
18491560	18493560	Now.
18501560	18503560	What?
18503560	18505560	Do you have the garden?
18511560	18513560	No.
18533560	18535560	Are we gonna be okay?
18541560	18543560	No.
18547560	18549560	It's fine!
18549560	18551560	Is he still in there?
18557560	18559560	We're good.
18559560	18561560	We're safe, I think.
18563560	18565560	If it isn't my favorite son-in-law,
18565560	18567560	what brings you here again?
18571560	18573560	Huh?
18575560	18577560	Thank you for the $3.33.
18577560	18579560	Hey, Merce.
18579560	18581560	For a tiny-
18581560	18583560	Spiny?
18583560	18585560	Spiny?
18585560	18587560	Hi, Merce.
18587560	18589560	I apologize, but your son-in-law must go to sleep.
18589560	18591560	I'll try and watch the rest of the vlog tomorrow.
18591560	18593560	Good luck with the rest of the game, Kohai.
18593560	18595560	Okay, have good sleep.
18595560	18597560	Thank you for tuning in.
18597560	18599560	You!
18599560	18601560	Yeah, whole!
18611560	18613560	We spying!
18617560	18619560	What about Karen again?
18625560	18627560	Maybe I can talk to the mother?
18629560	18631560	Hello, dear.
18631560	18633560	Yes, please.
18633560	18635560	She's upstairs.
18635560	18637560	Have you heard that Edna's daughter, Karen,
18637560	18639560	has disappeared?
18639560	18641560	These things happen.
18641560	18643560	We just have to deal with them step-by-step
18643560	18645560	one day at a time.
18651560	18653560	Man!
18653560	18655560	Who told you about Karen?
18659560	18661560	Why, I suppose it was Mr. Poston.
18661560	18663560	Or maybe not.
18663560	18665560	I can't remember.
18665560	18667560	Please excuse me, Steve.
18667560	18669560	You seem flustered.
18669560	18671560	Not at all.
18671560	18673560	Everything is fine.
18673560	18675560	Hmm.
18675560	18677560	Can I talk about Karen again?
18677560	18679560	Sorry, I didn't catch that.
18679560	18681560	Nighty-sus.
18689560	18693560	Where were you Tuesday night?
18697560	18699560	Sorry, I didn't catch that.
18699560	18701560	Tuesday?
18701560	18703560	Sorry, I didn't...
18703560	18705560	I don't think nothing happens with her
18705560	18707560	if you just say fuck.
18707560	18709560	Sorry, I...
18709560	18711560	Give my regards to your parents.
18713560	18715560	Tuesday?
18721560	18723560	Interesting.
18731560	18733560	I might...
18735560	18737560	Oh, wait.
18737560	18739560	Was that a different animation?
18739560	18741560	Sorry.
18745560	18747560	Okay, okay.
18749560	18753560	I guess I'll just have to ask alibis, right?
18755560	18757560	Do I ask everyone?
18757560	18759560	Stop peeping!
18759560	18761560	It's a new animation!
18769560	18771560	Okay, so I messed up and
18771560	18773560	I didn't get mom's alibi.
18773560	18775560	So...
18775560	18777560	Let's go.
18781560	18783560	Hello, Steve. Care to buy?
18783560	18785560	Oh, thanks.
18785560	18787560	Okay, dear.
18787560	18789560	Come back soon.
18789560	18791560	Steve, you live close to Mr. Johnson.
18791560	18793560	How is he taking it?
18793560	18795560	Such wanton vandalism.
18795560	18797560	It just breaks my heart.
18797560	18799560	I'll have to send him a nice fruit basket.
18799560	18801560	Though if he wants some new paint and sealant,
18801560	18803560	it'll cost him.
18805560	18807560	Heavens, did you hear that Karen has disappeared?
18807560	18809560	I saw her playing outside the wayward hotel
18809560	18811560	on Tuesday night.
18811560	18813560	The night she vanished.
18813560	18815560	Did she seem upset?
18815560	18817560	Wayward hotel, huh?
18817560	18819560	Betsy, no.
18819560	18821560	She was under adult supervision.
18821560	18823560	So I didn't think anything of it.
18823560	18825560	You mean Edna was with her?
18825560	18827560	No, not Edna.
18827560	18829560	A man.
18829560	18831560	Or an inordinately large woman.
18831560	18833560	Large man or woman, huh?
18833560	18835560	Alright.
18841560	18843560	Large man or woman?
18845560	18847560	Sorry, son.
18847560	18849560	No time to talk.
18849560	18851560	Neither.
18851560	18853560	Next time you post.
18855560	18857560	Large...
18857560	18859560	men...
18859560	18861560	or women?
18867560	18869560	Hold on.
18869560	18871560	Is it...?
18871560	18873560	There's...
18873560	18875560	two large men...
18875560	18877560	I think.
18877560	18879560	That would be...
18879560	18881560	Johnson...
18881560	18883560	the sheriff...
18885560	18887560	and...
18889560	18891560	Mr. Potsdam.
18895560	18897560	Think about taking some of that sighting off my hand, son.
18897560	18899560	Okay.
18899560	18901560	I'll cut you a nice price on it.
18903560	18905560	Too bad about Edna's daughter going missing.
18907560	18909560	That was a strange night.
18911560	18913560	I remember that evening.
18913560	18915560	The Potsdam's upstairs bathroom toilet packed up.
18917560	18919560	I've seen folks upset about that stuff.
18921560	18923560	But Mr. Potsdam was just...
18923560	18925560	furious.
18925560	18927560	Hey, they even got it downstairs.
18929560	18931560	They got it downstairs, brother.
18945560	18947560	I thought he was working with you!
18959560	18961560	Well, that's a sure sign...
18961560	18963560	that civilization is coming to an end.
18971560	18973560	I don't think it was aliens.
18985560	18987560	Uh...
18987560	18989560	I don't want to hear about Tuesday.
19001560	19003560	Lights in a cemetery.
19009560	19011560	Give me a second.
19013560	19015560	I want to see the note they got at the police station.
19017560	19019560	Boy,
19019560	19021560	the way you keep pestering me,
19021560	19023560	you'd think you were feeling guilty about something.
19023560	19025560	Are you?
19025560	19027560	I understand you witnessed Ms. Whaley's
19027560	19029560	dispensing a little discipline at the school.
19029560	19031560	And she thinks you may be
19031560	19033560	feeling a mite bent about it.
19037560	19039560	Am I in my own business, Sheriff?
19039560	19041560	That's always the wisest course, boy.
19043560	19045560	Sticking your nose where it doesn't belong
19045560	19047560	can get you in a world of trouble.
19047560	19049560	Especially if you're a gynecologist.
19051560	19053560	Heck, there isn't a psychiatrist
19053560	19055560	around who disagree about
19055560	19057560	what a calm and influential
19057560	19059560	dent in the head.
19059560	19061560	Calm and influential?
19061560	19063560	If you argue with science, Steve,
19063560	19065560	it's bigger than all of us.
19065560	19067560	I got a report here that someone
19067560	19069560	put a ding on Johnson's tucker.
19071560	19073560	As honoured as Johnson is about
19073560	19075560	that old car, I suppose
19075560	19077560	he had it coming.
19077560	19079560	I imagine it was just some kids pulling a prank.
19079560	19081560	I suppose you've
19081560	19083560	heard the news about Edna's daughter, Karen,
19083560	19085560	disappearing.
19087560	19089560	What should I say?
19089560	19091560	Yes, I'm very concerned.
19091560	19093560	Or no,
19093560	19095560	Karen vanished?
19095560	19097560	What should I say?
19097560	19099560	One?
19103560	19105560	Okay.
19109560	19111560	I wouldn't think about it too much
19111560	19113560	if I were you.
19113560	19115560	This is a serious crime.
19115560	19117560	And this is no time for civilians
19117560	19119560	to be nosing around playing cops and robbers.
19121560	19123560	What about civic responsibility?
19123560	19125560	Steve,
19125560	19127560	I'd give this advice to my own son
19127560	19129560	if I had one.
19129560	19131560	Leave this be.
19131560	19133560	This is not the kind of thing you should look into.
19133560	19135560	I'm being paid off.
19135560	19137560	So some wild oats, boy.
19137560	19139560	Kick up your heels.
19139560	19141560	Join the lodge.
19141560	19143560	Join the lodge, Steve.
19143560	19145560	And leave Karen to the professionals.
19147560	19149560	Stop on by any time.
19149560	19151560	No, no, no.
19151560	19153560	Hold on.
19155560	19157560	I'm sorry.
19157560	19159560	I don't feel a...
19159560	19161560	any time.
19165560	19167560	Where's the note?
19167560	19169560	Where's the note?
19169560	19171560	Where's the note?
19177560	19179560	You said there was a note. Where's the fucking note?
19185560	19187560	Where's the note?
19201560	19203560	I can't stop and chat.
19215560	19217560	That's it.
19217560	19219560	It's Stephanie's forge.
19231560	19233560	Hold on.
19233560	19235560	Flashing lights in the cemetery, right?
19235560	19237560	Well, that didn't work.
19237560	19239560	Well, that didn't work.
19245560	19247560	Can I move this?
19251560	19253560	I moved it!
19259560	19261560	Oh, my God!
19261560	19263560	Thank God I found you.
19263560	19265560	Are you all right, Karen?
19265560	19267560	I want to go home.
19267560	19269560	I'll be right back.
19269560	19271560	I'll be right back.
19271560	19273560	I found you.
19273560	19275560	Are you all right, Karen?
19275560	19277560	I want to go home.
19277560	19279560	Could you take me to my mommy's store?
19279560	19281560	Or to the policeman?
19281560	19283560	Can you tell me who did this to you?
19283560	19285560	Mr. Potstan
19285560	19287560	told me he'd hurt my mommy
19287560	19289560	if I told.
19289560	19291560	Won't do anything, I promise.
19291560	19293560	Tell me what happened.
19293560	19295560	He made me play house.
19295560	19297560	Then he dug a hole.
19297560	19299560	Please.
19299560	19301560	Can you go home now?
19301560	19303560	Please.
19303560	19305560	Can you tell me your address, honey?
19305560	19307560	I don't know.
19307560	19309560	Just take me to the store
19309560	19311560	or the policeman.
19311560	19313560	Please.
19313560	19315560	Mommy said to go to the policeman
19315560	19317560	if I got lost.
19317560	19319560	And I'm lost.
19321560	19323560	Bye bye.
19323560	19325560	What do you mean bye bye? We need to take you home!
19329560	19331560	How do I...
19331560	19333560	What do you mean bye bye?
19333560	19335560	We need to take you home!
19335560	19337560	How do I take her home?
19337560	19339560	What do you mean bye bye?
19355560	19357560	I don't trust the police.
19357560	19359560	I'm going back to the store.
19359560	19361560	What the hell?
19361560	19363560	Bring it! Thank you.
19387560	19389560	Bye bye.
19397560	19399560	I can't talk now.
19399560	19401560	The dishes are stacked up.
19403560	19405560	Okay!
19407560	19409560	I have money now!
19413560	19415560	I have money, right?
19415560	19417560	To the store?
19419560	19421560	And buy things?
19421560	19423560	Oh shit. I should save the game!
19423560	19425560	I should save!
19439560	19441560	Wait.
19441560	19443560	Where's the money?
19443560	19445560	I borrowed money.
19453560	19455560	I want that.
19455560	19457560	And I want this.
19459560	19461560	Oops.
19461560	19463560	Did I make a mistake?
19473560	19475560	That should cover it.
19475560	19477560	These 1950s prices are cheap.
19477560	19479560	Take what you need.
19487560	19489560	I don't need anything, right?
19489560	19491560	Wait. I need that.
19493560	19495560	I think that's all I need?
19495560	19497560	Yeah.
19499560	19501560	Are we going to be able to complete this game tonight?
19503560	19505560	I don't know!
19507560	19509560	No thanks.
19525560	19527560	Can I go down?
19527560	19529560	Thanks.
19533560	19535560	Where's the closet again?
19535560	19537560	This one?
19539560	19541560	Maybe I should save.
19543560	19545560	Save game.
19557560	19559560	Well that didn't work.
19559560	19561560	Oh man.
19561560	19563560	Oh man.
19563560	19565560	Well that didn't work.
19565560	19567560	Oh man.
19567560	19569560	Oh man.
19569560	19571560	Well that didn't work.
19571560	19573560	Wait. Which one is it?
19581560	19583560	Wait. Which one is it?
19583560	19585560	Guys! Which one is it?
19591560	19595560	I couldn't get up in the morning.
19599560	19603560	It feels kind of dark so I can't tell what time it is.
19603560	19605560	What time it is?
19619560	19621560	What's up?
19621560	19623560	Get a tap?
19633560	19635560	Okay.
19643560	19645560	Can I go into the inn?
19645560	19647560	I don't think I've been to the inn yet.
19647560	19649560	Why are you talking like that?
19661560	19663560	Why are you talking like that?
19677560	19679560	Oh we have to steal the mall, right?
19681560	19683560	But why does he...
19683560	19685560	Why is he like...
19689560	19691560	ETA big sale.
19691560	19693560	Door is locked.
19693560	19695560	Ugh.
19705560	19707560	I have several places I can set fire to.
19707560	19709560	Should I set fire?
19709560	19711560	Not set fire.
19711560	19713560	Should I do the...
19713560	19715560	Barbershop?
19717560	19719560	Let's save at the barbershop.
19723560	19725560	Okay.
19735560	19737560	Straight lace...
19737560	19739560	Slot screws...
19739560	19741560	Does the fill-up work with it?
19743560	19745560	Well that didn't work.
19745560	19747560	Well that didn't work.
19753560	19755560	Yeah, it has a sprinkler system.
19755560	19757560	Which is why I was wondering...
19757560	19759560	I could use it.
19761560	19763560	Well that didn't work.
19763560	19765560	What about...
19765560	19767560	The school's fire alarm?
19785560	19787560	What about the school's fire alarm?
19787560	19789560	What about the school's fire alarm?
19789560	19791560	What about the school's fire alarm?
19801560	19803560	I gotta get out of here.
19815560	19817560	I can get an axe.
19820560	19822560	I can get a ladder too.
19829560	19831560	Wait, how do I get in?
19837560	19839560	Wait someone, how do I get in?
19841560	19843560	You just go in.
19843560	19845560	It's not letting me, just go in.
19849560	19851560	Wait what?
19855560	19857560	There a hole in the second story window?
19865560	19867560	Are you sure I can just go in?
19867560	19869560	Damn it.
19873560	19875560	Are you sure I can just go in?
19881560	19883560	Okay.
19891560	19893560	What?
19893560	19895560	Try a ladder?
19895560	19897560	A ladder on what?
19917560	19919560	How do I get in?
19923560	19925560	Okay.
19935560	19937560	I don't get it.
19939560	19941560	Oh man.
19941560	19943560	Help!
19943560	19945560	Help, help!
19945560	19947560	Help!
19953560	19955560	Help!
19965560	19969560	Am I supposed to go to the school then?
19983560	19985560	Help!
20003560	20007560	Okay, but I want to go into the place.
20007560	20013560	I have to get out in at night?
20015560	20017560	Aw.
20037560	20039560	Give me back my key.
20045560	20047560	Okay.
20047560	20049560	No?
20051560	20053560	Which is the closet?
20053560	20055560	Which is the closet?
20069560	20071560	All the alarm at my house?
20071560	20073560	Okay.
20083560	20085560	What do I just push it?
20087560	20089560	Of the axe?
20093560	20095560	Do I use the ladder then?
20097560	20099560	Damn it.
20101560	20103560	Uh, wrench?
20109560	20111560	Use axe on brother, I would do that.
20114560	20116560	He didn't care.
20136560	20140560	Do I use the ladder here?
20143560	20145560	Okay.
20145560	20147560	Oh man.
20153560	20155560	Okay.
20173560	20175560	Hmm.
20183560	20187560	I should change to a magnifying glass, huh?
20187560	20189560	Is it changing?
20191560	20193560	I think you need a furniture dolly.
20193560	20195560	A dolly?
20199560	20201560	What am I going to get a dolly?
20203560	20205560	Okay.
20215560	20217560	How are you not tired?
20217560	20223560	I'm a bit tired, but I want to finish this day first, Senpai.
20223560	20229560	I want to finish this day first, and then maybe we can, you know...
20233560	20235560	Okay.
20239560	20243560	Then we move on to the next day.
20243560	20245560	Oh man.
20245560	20247560	Okay.
20247560	20249560	Okay.
20255560	20259560	I'm not, I don't have the same stamina as Shibi or...
20259560	20261560	...our mummy.
20261560	20264560	But I do, I am kind of like oof.
20264560	20266560	Tired.
20271560	20273560	Is there a dolly here?
20289560	20291560	Mr. Johnson's garage?
20310560	20312560	Oops.
20312560	20314560	Fatboy, well I'll make the carrot.
20314560	20316560	I'll make the carrot.
20316560	20318560	Fatboy, huh?
20326560	20328560	What do you mean?
20330560	20332560	What do you mean?
20336560	20338560	What do you mean?
20338560	20340560	I messed it up for you.
20340560	20342560	What?
20343560	20345560	Can I go in here?
20360560	20362560	Oh.
20362560	20364560	Okay.
20366560	20368560	Anything else I need?
20371560	20375560	I can just go in and out, huh? That's kind of weird.
20389560	20391560	What? Why?
20391560	20393560	Okay, bye.
20393560	20397560	Suddenly the dialogue came back?
20400560	20402560	Okay.
20411560	20413560	What's this?
20415560	20417560	Turn off the alarm system.
20419560	20421560	Okay, let's save here.
20431560	20436560	What? Undo the screws?
20442560	20446560	This photograph is a constant torture for borrowed dad.
20446560	20448560	Exotic kinky love equipment.
20448560	20450560	No, leave that there.
20450560	20452560	If any of it turns up missing.
20454560	20457560	Marv, what's going on in there?
20461560	20463560	Go! Go!
20463560	20467560	Wait, no dad, I need you. I need you to sign this first.
20467560	20472560	I need some meat, and Pat won't give me any without your sign permission.
20472560	20474560	Good old dependable Pat.
20474560	20478560	Here son, here's my signature.
20478560	20481560	Take it to him, and you won't have any problem.
20481560	20485560	Now go son, go quickly, before she comes back.
20486560	20489560	Not yet, dad, I want to talk to you.
20494560	20498560	Are you my father? Really? I don't remember you.
20498560	20502560	Please. I'm not in the mood for jokes.
20502560	20504560	I'm serious, why won't anyone believe me?
20504560	20507560	Oh my gosh, that's all you care about?
20507560	20511560	Just don't make me laugh now.
20511560	20516560	Remember the stitches? My God, what has she done to you?
20516560	20520560	She doesn't know you're here, does she? Does she?
20523560	20527560	No, I had to break in. What the hell is going on in here?
20527560	20529560	I know it's a mystery to you.
20529560	20534560	The sacred things that husband wants you behind closed doors.
20534560	20538560	Maybe we should have the special father's son dog.
20539560	20542560	The special father's son dog?
20543560	20545560	Yeah, I'd like that.
20561560	20563560	Okay. Yeah?
20569560	20572560	And bolt it with at least three locks.
20572560	20574560	At least three?
20594560	20596560	Aww.
20598560	20602560	They close on the woman, and then they...
20605560	20608560	With the barbed wire, they...
20610560	20614560	That's all right, don't get worked up. You need your rest.
20614560	20617560	Yes, rest.
20617560	20619560	But why did you come?
20619560	20623560	You must have had a reason for risking it.
20623560	20627560	I need some meat, and Pat won't give me any without your signed permission.
20627560	20629560	Good old dependable, Pat.
20629560	20633560	Here, son. Here's my signature.
20633560	20636560	Take it to him, and you won't have any problem.
20636560	20640560	Now go, son. Go quickly, before she comes back.
20645560	20649560	This is no time to talk, gibberish. Get out of here.
20649560	20651560	Now!
20651560	20654560	I love you, Dad.
20654560	20656560	This is no time to talk.
20656560	20657560	Love?
20657560	20658560	This is no time to talk.
20658560	20660560	Okay. Bye, Dad.
20665560	20667560	So do I put it back?
20667560	20669560	Well, that didn't work.
20669560	20671560	Aw, man.
20671560	20673560	Well, that didn't work.
20675560	20677560	Huh.
20679560	20681560	Okay, well...
20681560	20683560	At least...
20683560	20685560	I don't know what to do.
20685560	20687560	I don't know what to do.
20687560	20689560	I don't know what to do.
20689560	20691560	I don't know what to do.
20691560	20693560	I don't know what to do.
20693560	20695560	Okay, well...
20695560	20697560	At least...
20697560	20700560	Dad taught me the last words.
20700560	20703560	With his last words about what...
20703560	20705560	What the...
20705560	20707560	You know, married couples do.
20724560	20727560	Yeah, Dad taught us a lot.
20727560	20729560	Well, that didn't work.
20729560	20731560	Well, that didn't work.
20731560	20733560	Well, that didn't work.
20733560	20735560	Well, that didn't work.
20735560	20737560	That won't happen to us, right, Kohai?
20737560	20739560	Just be good.
20743560	20745560	I guess I'll go to the meat plant.
20745560	20747560	And I'll give myself some meat.
20747560	20749560	Well, that didn't work.
20749560	20751560	So, your father okayed the meat, huh?
20751560	20753560	How's he doing?
20755560	20757560	Um...
20775560	20777560	Two? Two?
20777560	20779560	What if I say the first one?
20781560	20783560	What if I say the first one?
20783560	20785560	Will I get in trouble? Will I die?
20789560	20791560	I should save first.
20791560	20793560	No, I can't save right now.
20793560	20795560	I can't save right now.
20803560	20805560	Okay, fine.
20805560	20807560	First one, first one.
20815560	20817560	He didn't care.
20823560	20825560	He didn't care.
20849560	20851560	He didn't care.
20851560	20853560	He didn't care.
20861560	20863560	Wait, why is it nighttime already?
20867560	20869560	Did I, did I...
20869560	20871560	I didn't even get the firefighter stuff.
20871560	20873560	Wait.
20873560	20875560	Stop, Steve.
20901560	20903560	Dead.
20903560	20905560	Dead.
20927560	20929560	Yes.
20931560	20933560	Yeah, you gonna rat on me?
20957560	20959560	Here?
20961560	20963560	Yeah.
20975560	20977560	Somewhere, huh?
20977560	20979560	Darkness vaults.
20979560	20981560	I forgot what he said.
20991560	20993560	Huh.
21003560	21005560	Okay, fine.
21009560	21011560	Huh!
21021560	21023560	Well, that didn't work.
21023560	21025560	All right.
21039560	21041560	Can I turn it off now?
21041560	21043560	Do I have it?
21051560	21053560	Yeah, I got it.
21053560	21055560	Thanks.
21063560	21065560	Okay, I'm gonna go.
21065560	21067560	I'm gonna go now.
21071560	21073560	Uh, see ya.
21081560	21083560	This game is so crunchy.
21083560	21087560	Well, this game is from what year was this game out?
21089560	21091560	When year did this game come out?
21091560	21093560	Arvester game.
21097560	21099560	1996.
21099560	21101560	Okay.
21101560	21103560	It's old.
21103560	21105560	I can't believe.
21105560	21107560	He sleeps in jeans.
21107560	21109560	Steve sleeps in jeans.
21111560	21113560	Yes.
21113560	21123560	What do you people want from me?
21123560	21135560	Welcome to our Horde, the land that grips the life of its death.
21135560	21137560	Stephanie.
21137560	21145560	1996 is old? Do you know when the internet was made?
21145560	21149560	Senpai. Do you know when the internet was made?
21149560	21153560	When the internet went public?
21153560	21163560	95. This is one year after. Okay?
21163560	21165560	Oh my gosh.
21165560	21169560	Well, we're gonna save here.
21169560	21175560	I'm tired.
21175560	21183560	I'm tired, and I think I want to take a nap.
21183560	21187560	Well, a big sleep.
21187560	21197560	I want to take a big sleep.
21197560	21203560	I think about...
21203560	21211560	Don't look Senpai. Don't look at my steam. Don't look.
21211560	21221560	I don't know why it does that.
21221560	21231560	Okay.
21231560	21237560	Alright. Senpai.
21237560	21247560	This tomorrow will be the end, officially the end of the first week since debut.
21247560	21253560	Tomorrow I'll be playing Death Mark.
21253560	21257560	So...
21257560	21269560	And that will be probably the final of the genre of games that I like the most.
21269560	21281560	And that is the preview of all facets of me, Mercy Modest.
21281560	21291560	So, you can, as you saw, those were all games that I particularly...
21291560	21295560	genre of games that I particularly like. I feel like...
21295560	21303560	I feel like my point-and-click love really shone through in today's stream.
21303560	21308560	So, I think that this is probably a good one.
21308560	21314560	Honestly, I'm super invested. This is why I love point-and-clicks.
21314560	21320560	I really love point-and-clicks because they are definitely a genre I really love.
21320560	21326560	It's a genre that I grew up with. It's a genre where it's a lot of storytelling
21326560	21336560	and a lot of problem solving, and that's like some things that I really like.
21336560	21340560	So, honestly, I want to play more point-and-clicks.
21340560	21344560	We're definitely going to return to Harvester, hopefully.
21344560	21354560	When I stream it next time, I can finish it, hopefully.
21354560	21362560	And yeah, I played a lot of point-and-clicks. I played a lot of point-and-clicks. A lot.
21362560	21370560	So, if there's a chance I can play another one for Senpai's, I think I'll be great.
21380560	21384560	Will you be playing Miss Slash the Riven series? I'm not sure.
21384560	21390560	Miss is kind of 3D, right? I might. I might.
21392560	21396560	Oh, what else?
21396560	21408560	I might take a day off my schedule for next week's stream simply because I'm really exhausted Senpai.
21408560	21414560	A week of full streaming, no breaks. I'm really exhausted Senpai.
21414560	21424560	Tomorrow, yeah, we're playing Death Mark, which is a visual novel game.
21424560	21434560	I played it a bit, but I took a huge break from it, so it will feel like starting fresh again.
21434560	21442560	And I don't remember a lot of the puzzles or the gameplay, so we should be fine.
21443560	21445560	What else? What else?
21445560	21456560	Oh yeah, and tomorrow, I probably won't be late, but I'm really looking forward to it because my IRL friends are going to treat me to sushi
21456560	21463560	because they're like, congratulations on getting into Fialor, so I'm very happy.
21464560	21474560	I'm very happy that I can go meet out with my friends, but I probably am going to cut it short so I can come back and stream.
21480560	21483560	Are you going to be altering the times you stream? No.
21483560	21501560	Now, Fialor has kind of divided everyone into certain time slots to cover a variety of time zones, and I've taken over this time slot.
21501560	21510560	So unfortunately, I will be streaming all my streams to be at the same time, will start at the same time every time.
21514560	21528560	I'll see, except for, I think, when there are collabs, when there are collabs or special occasions, then I think the time is going to be a little bit more off.
21531560	21540560	Unfortunately, is it not a good time for you? I worry it's not a good time for senpais, because I know there are some senpais that want to catch me,
21540560	21546560	but unfortunately, I'm not matching their time zones. I hope that makes sense.
21546560	21552560	This makes me a little sad that some senpais won't be able to watch me.
21552560	21566560	I'd really like to cater to awesome pies, but at the same time, I don't want to overlap completely with my gen mates as well.
21566560	21576560	And we all start at certain times, which makes us available, like all of us available for our certain times.
21579560	21587560	So I feel bad that some senpais will be left out, which is why I say that.
21588560	21606560	So I still hope that the senpais that can't catch me will catch the vods, although I think there's something a little special about seeing things live,
21607560	21614560	which is why I feel a little sad, and that's why I say, unfortunately, instead of I'm glad.
21614560	21620560	I am glad that I get to have a time slot where I can do a lot of things in the daytime
21620560	21635560	and like be able to hang out with mama and papa and do my chores and just get ready for the day for stream.
21635560	21645560	And then at night time, I can stream and be like entertaining and I can be with my senpais.
21646560	21663560	But yeah, I feel a little bad that I can't cater to everyone, but I don't want to step on anyone's toes for their specific time slots as well.
21663560	21674560	I picked this time because it's the time where I'm kind of used to as well.
21675560	21687560	Yeah, at the end of the day, time zones are hard work for everyone.
21687560	21689560	Yeah, I'll try my best.
21689560	21695560	Maybe one day I'll schedule in some earlier streams, but once again, I kind of don't want to step on toes,
21695560	21705560	but I'll ask management if there's like a day where there's not a lot of, if many of my gen mates are having time off or something,
21705560	21713560	I can slip in a earlier stream.
21714560	21726560	I want everyone to enjoy Mercy Modi's.
21726560	21739560	Gorilla, I don't want to do gorilla all too much because I feel like if I do a gorilla stream that there are going to be some people who miss out and then they'll feel bad about it.
21739560	21746560	They'll feel like they've been left out, you know?
21746560	21751560	That's my feel on it.
21751560	21759560	I know that my gen mates will do it, but I feel like...
21759560	21761560	What is a gorilla stream?
21761560	21766560	It's a stream that's unannounced, so I just go on in the stream, you know?
21766560	21777560	Like, surprise! It's not on the schedule, but here we go!
21777560	21787560	So, I don't want my senpais to be like, I missed it! No! Or I didn't know she was doing that stream!
21787560	21793560	I don't want senpais to feel left out, so I'd rather schedule it.
21793560	21807560	If senpais really wanted to watch it, they can plan around it.
21807560	21818560	I feel like my gen mates are free to do what they want, but this is my own personal belief.
21818560	21826560	That's my opinion. It's my own personal belief, so don't think that the way that I think is going to be the way my gen mates think.
21826560	21836560	I'm very much a traditionalist in a way, so for example, my gen mates, they are free to talk about past lives and stuff,
21836560	21843560	but I'm definitely not a person who wants to discuss it, but not discuss my own personal past life.
21843560	21857560	I don't mind if they talk to me about their past lives, but I don't want to talk about my past life type of thing.
21857560	21872560	And I think the only times I'll ever do a gorilla stream is if I'm on vacation, but even then I'll feel bad for senpais who missed it, you know?
21873560	21893560	I know there's a lot of freedom and stuff within violor, but I'm still in kind of the idol mindset.
21893560	21896560	I'm very much in the idol mindset.
21903560	21917560	I don't know if there's like, you know, if there's a market for like an arrow idol.
21917560	21937560	But yeah, I think, I think, yeah, I'm very much pretty much a traditionalist.
21937560	21942560	I follow the JP formula a lot.
21948560	21954560	I hope that, honestly, I'm kind of like Strani.
21954560	21961560	I kind of want to have like the idol, the idol outfits, like the idol concert type of thing.
21961560	21977560	I know it's not traditional and some people might be very opposed to it.
21977560	21978560	Yeah.
21981560	21987560	Some people might be opposed to it, but it's kind of like, it's kind of my dream.
21987560	21988560	Senpai.
21988560	21995560	You know, it's a little bit of my dream to try to pursue being an idol.
21995560	21997560	Just a little bit.
21997560	22004560	It doesn't have to be completely, since all paths are strange.
22007560	22015560	But you know, ever since I watched Creamy Mami, I was like, I love this, I love this so much.
22018560	22038560	But my number one dream is, of course, to like, make my Senpai's happy and smile.
22038560	22040560	I really like, I really like that show, though.
22040560	22042560	I love the song.
22049560	22053560	Any specific idol outfits you like?
22053560	22060560	I kind of like the, they're all kind of like marching band slash military-esque.
22060560	22065560	I kind of like the pastel colored ones.
22065560	22078560	And the ones that are like, the one that are kind of poofy, like poofy skirts.
22078560	22081560	Thank you, Anonymous, for the 420.
22081560	22085560	Yeah, blaze it, or whatever them kids say.
22091560	22093560	What do you mean, peculiar aesthetics?
22093560	22095560	It's just the idol look.
22100560	22102560	It's just the idol look.
22105560	22107560	Creamy Mami will be our next home marker.
22107560	22108560	No, no, no.
22108560	22121560	I think Creamy Mami will be too long for, and I think Creamy Mami is also a little bit harder to digest for Senpai's because of its age.
22121560	22126560	Being a very early Magical Girl series, it's also very long.
22126560	22137560	So I feel Cardcaptor Sakura is digestible and that it can be marathoned, but Creamy Mami, I don't think, is a marathonable.
22139560	22141560	Not Minky Momo.
22143560	22150560	Minky Momo is, it was definitely a wild ride.
22151560	22166560	But I feel like Cardcaptor Sakura is kind of one of the things that I really appreciate.
22166560	22185560	I won't lie to Senpai's, but Cardcaptor Sakura literally got me through some really hard times.
22185560	22187560	She literally saved my life.
22187560	22194560	Oh hi, look up the Curse of Minky Momo.
22194560	22197560	I already know the Curse of Minky Momo.
22199560	22202560	I already know the Curse of Minky Momo.
22208560	22211560	I know, I know it, I know it.
22212560	22221560	And if you, if Senpai's don't know it, just, I think, who's the YouTuber that covers it very well?
22221560	22223560	Kenny Lauderdale?
22223560	22227560	Yeah, that YouTuber covers it quite well.
22227560	22244560	The original, right? Not the Novana dub. I actually grew up with the Novana dub, but I love the original.
22244560	22248560	I think both of them are really good, actually.
22248560	22256560	The Novana dub, people are like, oh, it's bad, whatever. I think it's still a little bit, I think, despite it being a dub,
22256560	22260560	I feel like this voice is suited the characters quite well.
22268560	22274560	But Sakura has a saying that she keeps on like a mantra that she says,
22274560	22281560	and I've used that mantra to get through hard times a lot, which is, surely everything will be alright.
22287560	22290560	So that's gotten me through, like, really tough times.
22296560	22300560	Truly, surely, whatever, it's the same, it's the same mantra.
22305560	22309560	So, yeah, Cardcaptor Sakura literally saved my life.
22309560	22311560	So, uh...
22315560	22317560	So, Senpai's will have to watch it, too.
22318560	22319560	Understood?
22321560	22335560	Actually, the other day, I went to GameStop and I saw the clown wand, and I was like, oh, so I got it.
22335560	22339560	I got the wand, it's right underneath my desk.
22346560	22348560	You don't have to watch Clear Card.
22348560	22354560	I think for Senpai's homework would be just Season 1, Season 2, and then the two movies.
22355560	22366560	So, the two movies will be the Cardcaptor Sakura, the movie, and then Cardcaptor Sakura, the sealed card.
22366560	22368560	That'll be the second movie.
22377560	22380560	So, yeah, I ended up buying the wand.
22381560	22395560	A few years ago, my friends funded, put together some money, and then they got me the Sakura wand, you know, the Star Wand.
22398560	22401560	They got me the Star Wand, and I was like, yeah!
22402560	22405560	My wand, my angel's wand!
22406560	22412560	Well, you ever have Movie Night in a Discord?
22412560	22414560	Um, there's no Discord.
22415560	22419560	There's fan Discord, but there's no Discord.
22420560	22421560	Sorry.
22424560	22426560	Did you do a pose with it before?
22426560	22428560	Oh, yeah, I did.
22428560	22436560	I did like the classic little, like, heal, heal down, and she, like, does the, when she captures a card.
22443560	22444560	Did we use Discord?
22444560	22452560	Yeah, we have a work Discord, and the Discord for work we can also chat in, but not a, like, official fan Discord.
22452560	22460560	There's a, I think there's a Discord just for stream announcements, too.
22470560	22472560	I don't think it would happen, though.
22472560	22476560	I don't think a Discord where the girls are in will happen.
22476560	22478560	Simply because of safety reasons.
22479560	22481560	Because of safety reasons, Senpai.
22490560	22492560	There's a...
22494560	22502560	I'm not saying you, Senpai, will use it maliciously, but there are lots of other people who will use it maliciously.
22502560	22506560	Which is why, um...
22509560	22521560	Which is why we probably won't have a Discord, but we can interact with you through stream, YouTube comments, Maros, and on Twitter.
22521560	22536560	So there's lots of avenues to, um, talk to, to talk to us as well.
22536560	22545560	We might not always reply simply because there's just a lot of messages, but I'm always thankful.
22546560	22554560	And I'm sure that my gen mates were also very thankful for all the kind messages that everyone leaves as well.
22561560	22568560	So yeah, I might not always respond, but I will, I do, I do see it.
22572560	22573560	I do see it.
22574560	22576560	Yeah, Lori Kostrani's home for sad girls.
22578560	22580560	I think we're very happy now, actually.
22582560	22584560	We're very happy.
22585560	22592560	I mean, like, let's be real, though. If you're a VTuber, you have some kind of metal Illinois.
22604560	22606560	But...
22621560	22624560	But, uh, it's definitely...
22625560	22630560	All of us have our struggles, but, you know, we're here to entertain.
22630560	22632560	In the end, we're here to entertain.
22632560	22642560	And VLR has six wonderful talents for everyone to indulge in.
22643560	22646560	I'm trying to wink, but I have an eye patch.
22647560	22648560	Hahaha.
22653560	22655560	You need an account to send in tomorrow?
22655560	22665560	Uh, not necessarily, but if you want any of the girls, including myself, to reply, there's a chance that we'll reply privately.
22665560	22672560	So if you want to be responded to privately, that would be, uh, you need an account.
22673560	22675560	Hahaha.
22678560	22687560	But if you don't mind the question just being, like, posted publicly on, like, the Mara Wall, then that's it.
22689560	22692560	Sometimes I don't respond. I'm not...
22693560	22704560	Because I feel like if I say thank you over and over, I just sound like a broken record, and I feel like I don't want to fill the Mara Wall completely with all my thank you.
22704560	22711560	So I keep the Maros that are, like, compliments and saying nice things close to my heart instead.
22711560	22712560	Hahaha.
22714560	22727560	Also, yes, it's anonymous so that, um, so that there's still kind of a safety barrier for not only you, Senpai, but for us as well.
22731560	22732560	Oh, yeah.
22732560	22733560	Haha.
22739560	22749560	So yeah, you...there's many avenues in which you can interact with us, so it's not too bad.
22749560	22751560	It's not too bad, even if we don't have a Discord.
22751560	22754560	But yeah, no Discord is a safety thing.
22754560	22756560	Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
22761560	22764560	So I think that's it. I think that's it.
22764560	22765560	Hmm.
22765560	22767560	I say any more questions, Senpai.
22767560	22775560	I'm willing to answer maybe a couple more if any any questions about Villalor, uh, props up.
22775560	22786560	If not, I think we're done for today. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
22791560	22794560	I just feel the stream for six hours again, all high.
22794560	22797560	Well, it feels like it's gonna be probably the norm.
