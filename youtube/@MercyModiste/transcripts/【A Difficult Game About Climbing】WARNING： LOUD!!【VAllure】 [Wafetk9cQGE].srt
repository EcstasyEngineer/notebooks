1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
What are you doing?

2
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,860
Waaaaaah!

3
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,940
Waaaaaaaaaah!

4
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,240
Waaaaaah! Welcome!

5
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,580
Snipped at some pies.

6
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,340
Welcome to the stream.

7
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,420
Waaag!

8
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,660
Guess what?

9
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,300
I almost missed stream because I decided to take a nap.

10
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,380
I decided to take a nap.

11
00:05:48,380 --> 00:06:00,380
And I slept through the three alarms that I set up.

12
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,940
So I guess everyone was just really tired.

13
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,780
Anyways, welcome to the stream.

14
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,780
Today we're playing a game called Difficult Game About Climbing.

15
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,500
Why can this man not use his legs?

16
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I don't know.

17
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
But we're playing.

18
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Which arm do I release this arm?

19
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Yeah.

20
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Eee!

21
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Eee!

22
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Oh!

23
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Eee!

24
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Waaag!

25
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Eee!

26
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Ah!

27
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Eee!

28
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Eee!

29
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Eee!

30
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Yeah!

31
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Eee!

32
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Eee!

33
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Yeah.

34
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Okay.

35
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
We're gaming.

36
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
We're...

37
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
We're gaming.

38
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Wee.

39
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Move your hand over here.

40
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Thank you.

41
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Wee!

42
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Wee!

43
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Wee game!

44
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Wee game it!

45
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Yeah!

46
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Wee game it!

47
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Game!

48
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Ugh!

49
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Yeah!

50
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm so good at this!

51
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Ah-ha-ha!

52
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Ah-ha-ha!

53
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Ah-ha-ha!

54
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Ah-ha-ha!

55
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Ah-ha!

56
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Ah!

57
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Eee!

58
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Eh?

59
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Eh?

60
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Eh?

61
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Ah...

62
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Hi.

63
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
It's really high.

64
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Do it.

65
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Eee!

66
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Can I?

67
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Eee!

68
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Okay!

69
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Eh?

70
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Eh?

71
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Eee!

72
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Eee!

73
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Eee!

74
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Eee!

75
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Eee!

76
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Eee!

77
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Is this safe?

78
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Is it safe over here?

79
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Eee!

80
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Eee!

81
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
It was not safe at all!

82
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Okay, maybe...

83
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Maybe...

84
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
No.

85
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Maybe over here is safer.

86
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Woo!

87
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Eee!

88
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Woo!

89
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Ah-ha-ha!

90
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Ah-ha-ha!

91
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Okay, I got it!

92
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I got it!

93
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
I got it!

94
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
I got it, Senpai!

95
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Come on, Mouse.

96
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Don't...

97
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Don't mess with me!

98
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Don't mess with me yet!

99
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah!

100
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
See?

101
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Okay!

102
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Mister!

103
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Your hands!

104
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Woo!

105
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Tei!

106
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Tei!

107
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Tei!

108
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Yeah!

109
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Tei!

110
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Yeah!

111
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
We got it!

112
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Uh...

113
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Stay.

114
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Maybe if I pull up a little bit more?

115
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah.

116
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Uh...

117
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Yeah.

118
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Eh.

119
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Eh.

120
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Eh.

121
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Hmm.

122
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Hmm.

123
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Hmm.

124
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Hmm.

125
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Ooh!

126
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Flippery.

127
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Huh!

128
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

129
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Yeah!

130
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Baby!

131
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Yeah!

132
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Ah!

133
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Come on!

134
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Okay.

135
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
That's fine.

136
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Oh, no, I have to get the top top!

137
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Come on!

138
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Come on, grippers!

139
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah!

140
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Oh, yeah!

141
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Oh, yeah!

142
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Oh, yeah!

143
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Oh, yeah!

144
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Okay, maybe that's not a good idea.

145
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Go here.

146
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Yeah.

147
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Woo!

148
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

149
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Is this man, Diogenes?

150
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
This philosopher that lives in a pot

151
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
and pees on people?

152
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Ah!

153
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Woo!

154
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I thought I had it.

155
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Yeah!

156
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Don't fucking do that to me, man!

157
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Behold, Kohai!

158
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
A man!

159
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
That had to change his definition.

160
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Who was that?

161
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
That had to change the definition of a man?

162
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Yeah.

163
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Yeah.

164
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Yeah.

165
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Plato, yeah.

166
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Ooh.

167
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Gamer.

168
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Game.

169
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Yeah.

170
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh, yeah.

171
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh, yeah!

172
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Oh, yeah!

173
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Oh, yeah!

174
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Oh, yeah!

175
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Oh, yeah!

176
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Eh?

177
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
That's...

178
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
That's the way.

179
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Point it down.

180
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Oh!

181
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Ah!

182
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Ah!

183
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Oh!

184
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I made it!

185
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Yeah.

186
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Yeah.

187
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Oh!

188
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Oh!

189
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm not gonna lie.

190
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I have no idea...

191
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
which way to go.

192
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Am I going down?

193
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Still, or was I supposed to go up?

194
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Up?

195
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Don't tell me it's this one!

196
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Yeah.

197
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Hmm.

198
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Can I do it?

199
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I don't know if I can do it.

200
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Senpai, I don't know if I can do it!

201
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Hmm.

202
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I'm so scared!

203
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
What if this sign actually does mean death, Senpai?

204
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Senpai!

205
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Ah!

206
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Ah!

207
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Ah!

208
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Oi!

209
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Eh!

210
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Eh!

211
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Eh!

212
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Eh!

213
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Eh!

214
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
My Senpais are...

215
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
jerks, and I'm...

216
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
never...

217
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
leaving them...

218
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
ever...

219
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
again!

220
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Fuck!

221
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Don't worry, I'm speeding this.

222
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Yeah.

223
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Yeah.

224
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Man!

225
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
He just fucking swam through the lives!

226
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Dwing!

227
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Dwing!

228
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Dwing!

229
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Dwing!

230
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I said the stream was going to be loud, Senpai!

231
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Why didn't you believe me when I said that?

232
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Come on.

233
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Yeah.

234
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Ha!

235
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Ha!

236
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Ha!

237
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Ha!

238
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Ha!

239
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
No!

240
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Use your...

241
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
use your hands!

242
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Use your hands!

243
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Yeah!

244
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Hands!

245
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Safe.

246
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Safeful.

247
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Hands are getting...

248
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Oh no, I'm gripping the mouse so hard, Senpai!

249
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
My hands!

250
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Are crapping!

251
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
It's like...

252
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
holding scissors.

253
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Suffer in the not right way.

254
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Gaming.

255
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Gaming.

256
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Come on.

257
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Oh no!

258
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
You're slipping!

259
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
You're slipping!

260
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
How did I do this again?

261
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I was such a gamer earlier.

262
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Yeah.

263
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I should have some of it.

264
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Eat.

265
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Eat!

266
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Eat!

267
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Eat!

268
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Eat!

269
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Eat!

270
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Eat!

271
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Eat!

272
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Eat!

273
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Eat!

274
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Eat!

275
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Eat!

276
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Eat!

277
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Eat!

278
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Eat!

279
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Eat!

280
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Give me a second.

281
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Ah!

282
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
My hand!

283
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Okay.

284
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Senpai, my hands are...

285
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
small.

286
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
This mouse is big!

287
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Okay?

288
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Do you see my dilemma there?

289
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Huh.

290
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
You could just reach it just fine last time.

291
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
What?

292
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,500
So I have to have like this internal grip on him.

293
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
You reached it fine last time.

294
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I can hold it on the keyboard as well.

295
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Hold on.

296
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Hold on.

297
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I can pull up.

298
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Huh.

299
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Oh!

300
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Ah!

301
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Ah!

302
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Alright.

303
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Ugh.

304
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Wait.

305
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Go Serenities here!

306
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I love Serenity!

307
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Cosmica!

308
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Okay.

309
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Come on.

310
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Come on!

311
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Come on!

312
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Yeah!

313
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Oh yeah!

314
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Haha!

315
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Yeah!

316
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Yeah!

317
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Can I borrow...

318
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Yeah!

319
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Oh yeah!

320
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Oh yeah!

321
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Oh yeah!

322
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Stop there!

323
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Don't you fall!

324
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
This better not break like twice, right?

325
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
It just...

326
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
It's just there to spook me, right?

327
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Right, Senpai?

328
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Yeah.

329
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Yeah.

330
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Alright.

331
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Yeah.

332
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Yeah.

333
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Yeah.

334
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Yeah.

335
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Okay, leap of fate.

336
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Hey.

337
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Wait.

338
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Yeah!

339
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Oh yeah!

340
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

341
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Senpai!

342
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Senpai!

343
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Senpai!

344
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Senpai!

345
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Senpai!

346
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Senpai!

347
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Senpai!

348
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
I got a bone to pick with you!

349
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Haha!

350
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Haha!

351
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
How can I trust...

352
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Oh, there has to be an easier way, right?

353
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
Uh...

354
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
I didn't realize he slipped.

355
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Why are you like this, Mr. Oh?

356
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Why are you like this?

357
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I'm so mad!

358
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Grab.

359
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Grab.

360
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
I'm just wondering if I can reach up there.

361
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Hold on.

362
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Let me just...

363
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Okay.

364
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Okay.

365
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Okay.

366
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Okay.

367
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Okay.

368
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Okay.

369
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Okay.

370
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Okay.

371
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Okay.

372
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Okay.

373
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Okay.

374
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Okay.

375
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Okay.

376
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Okay.

377
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Okay.

378
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Okay.

379
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Okay.

380
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Okay.

381
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Okay.

382
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Okay.

383
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Okay.

384
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Okay.

385
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Okay.

386
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Good.

387
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Ehhh...

388
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
allergen?

389
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Oh.

390
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Okay.

391
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Okay.

392
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:58,500
It seems too high.

393
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:08,260
Yeah, you know what, we're not gonna do it, we're not gonna risk it, uh-oh, we're not

394
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:18,820
gonna risk that, nope, nope, I'm wondering, instead of going in and around, I can somehow

395
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,820
just get over there.

396
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,820
Probably not.

397
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,820
Boogie.

398
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:40,820
That's it, what's on the other side?

399
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,820
What's on the other side?

400
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,820
Let's just check it out.

401
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:58,820
Let's just check out what's on the other side.

402
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,820
Literally nothing.

403
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:18,820
The way he swam was so funny though.

404
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,820
Okay, come on.

405
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:37,820
And nothing, okay.

406
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
What?

407
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,820
He swam straight down?

408
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:49,820
No.

409
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,820
No.

410
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
Can he drown?

411
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:04,820
No, but I booted up the game a little bit earlier and he can drift away.

412
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:13,820
Did you know he can drift away in the water?

413
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:37,820
He can drift away in the water, what the heck, right?

414
00:28:37,820 --> 00:29:06,820
That was my mistake, by the way.

415
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,820
Stay.

416
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
Yeah.

417
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Yeah, you got it.

418
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:30,820
Yeah, you got it.

419
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,820
Yeah, we got this.

420
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,820
Yeah.

421
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,820
Yeah.

422
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Yeah.

423
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
What?

424
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:57,820
Stay, stay, stay.

425
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:25,820
I trust you.

426
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,820
I trust you, Mr. Bald Naked Man, sir.

427
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,820
I trust you.

428
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,820
Please don't, don't break this trust.

429
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,820
Yeah.

430
00:30:39,820 --> 00:31:05,820
This bald man has a name.

431
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Apparently his diogenes, apparently.

432
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:23,820
But I know that man doesn't shave, so.

433
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,820
Ooh, that was kind of dangerous.

434
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

435
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:56,820
Oh, what, okay.

436
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,820
How many pull-ups can you do, Marcy?

437
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:10,820
Zero.

438
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:18,820
Are you sure it's supposed to be this way, Senpai?

439
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:27,820
It's kind of dangerous.

440
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:53,820
Oh, that's where it falls, too.

441
00:32:53,820 --> 00:33:09,820
Good to know.

442
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:34,820
Use your, your, your yowly hands.

443
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Ow.

444
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,820
Yowly hands usually slip rate.

445
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:51,820
Yeah, with that amount of lube they use.

446
00:33:51,820 --> 00:34:01,820
Yeah.

447
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:11,820
Yep.

448
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:27,820
I can't get in the tub, Senpai.

449
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,820
I have no water today.

450
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:37,820
Apparently the water's going to turn on tomorrow, maybe.

451
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:47,820
I forgot to grip.

452
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:57,820
Maybe, I don't know, like, there could be lots of things that happen, right?

453
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:09,820
Yeah.

454
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,820
I don't know why I decided to climb on this thing when it's literally so easy to reach this.

455
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,820
I was so stupid.

456
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,820
I was so stupid.

457
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,820
What happened to your water?

458
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,820
Some emergency water line thing.

459
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Water thing, so they're like, okay, we got to, like, check for, like, stuff, and I was like, okay.

460
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,820
No shower, like, no water at all, so I'm like, okay.

461
00:35:51,820 --> 00:36:10,820
I've got, like, a ton of water because Papa has just a habit of boiling water and putting them into, like, bottles, so we just have lots.

462
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,820
Interesting, so when was the last time you showered?

463
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Some questions are left to the imagination, yeah?

464
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,820
Did you want the truth?

465
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,820
Did you want the truth?

466
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,820
Some plays?

467
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,820
You wanted the truth?

468
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:57,820
I haven't showered since debut.

469
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,820
I haven't showered since debut.

470
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:12,820
Here.

471
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:26,820
Today was my shower day, and then, well, turns out I'm destined to be stinky today.

472
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:43,820
I haven't showered for debut because I was like, okay, I'm really stressed, so I'm going to shower for debut, and then I've been preparing a lot of stuff for Senpai, so I haven't had time.

473
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:51,820
And today I was like, oh, well, I don't have a lot of stuff to prepare today, so I'm just going to have a shower today.

474
00:37:51,820 --> 00:38:00,820
The water, the electrician gas and water place was like, blur away your water!

475
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:07,820
And I was like, oh, great.

476
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Oh, come on.

477
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:20,820
Why am I so bad at this suddenly?

478
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,820
Thank you for the tip!

479
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,820
Thank you for the...

480
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:43,820
I can't read how much that was. Thank you for the tip, Mr. Tony.

481
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,820
I don't think I smell too badly.

482
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Maybe today I do.

483
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:15,820
Why is this area so much harder than it was like three minutes ago?

484
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:22,820
Like, I don't think... Okay, okay. Senpai, you're always like, oh, you're so stinky, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

485
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:33,820
But Senpai...

486
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,820
I don't sweat that much.

487
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:42,820
Not that much. I do sweat, but like, I don't sweat that much.

488
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Oh, come on.

489
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:11,820
That's what they all say! Who's all? Who's they? Who's they? What the fuck? Senpai, who is they?

490
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:23,820
Who the fuck is they?

491
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:42,820
Mars! Cut off his testicles!

492
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:03,820
I can't believe my Senpais would cheat on me like this.

493
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:13,820
I can't believe it. The entire time. I've done this for all of you guys. Look at me. I'm struggling. I'm struggling in this game.

494
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:24,820
For you, Senpai! And then what's the thing I get? Your dirty fucking cheating ass hole!

495
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:33,820
I don't smell.

496
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Okay. I don't smell that much.

497
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:55,820
In fact, science says that it should be, you know, with the person you love, the sweat smells like pheromones, so it should smell like flowers.

498
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:03,820
Okay.

499
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,820
I'm so mad! I got distracted. I got so angry.

500
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:20,820
Oh, are you sweating? A little bit.

501
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:37,820
I got distracted and angry. I was mad and angry and mad and pissed!

502
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:53,820
Anyways, I don't sweat. So, see, sweat that much. So, only once in a while does my pits stink, and you're going to be so shocked about this Senpai.

503
00:42:53,820 --> 00:43:06,820
For some reason, my feet don't sweat, and I don't know why.

504
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:19,820
Are they okay? I don't know. Maybe it's just naturally dry.

505
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:27,820
Here is the areas that I do sweat a little bit more than usual.

506
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:38,820
I sweat more around my neck.

507
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:54,820
And I sweat more around my lower back.

508
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:07,820
But yeah, it's mostly my neck.

509
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:16,820
Like the back of my neck gets really sweaty.

510
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:25,820
My pits can get sweaty.

511
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:36,820
And, oh yeah, it's mostly my neck. I always have to apply deodorant there.

512
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:57,820
Your hair long or short?

513
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:15,820
Senpai, do you have eyes? It's long.

514
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:44,820
Like you seem bad to me. Are we looking at the same characters? I'm right here Senpai! You know what the scissors in the hair? Hello? Did you forget what I looked like? Are you cheating? Are you such a cheating cheater that you forgot what I looked like?

515
00:45:44,820 --> 00:46:06,820
I don't know what I looked like.

516
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:19,820
I was hoping I could get that to work.

517
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:48,820
I was going to say something bad, but I remember that YouTube will hate bad words.

518
00:46:48,820 --> 00:47:14,820
Are you going to say the C word? No! I was going to say the S word.

519
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:39,820
Yeah, new tech. New tech found.

520
00:47:39,820 --> 00:48:01,820
Oh, Azura! Thank you for the raid! Azura! Azura! Azura!

521
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:10,820
Okay, I saw Senpai say I should be more up here. That I have bigger swing, right?

522
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:20,820
Welcome Raiders! Welcome to the stream! We are playing a very difficult game, a climbing game.

523
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:31,820
You'll hear lots of screams from me.

524
00:48:31,820 --> 00:49:00,820
I don't know Senpai, this seems a little far. Are you sure this is where I should be? Like here, maybe here? This looks safer.

525
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:15,820
I don't know. Okay, maybe I should be up more.

526
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:27,820
Are you here? Okay.

527
00:49:46,820 --> 00:50:05,820
Azura, you're going to cramp your hand! Don't do this!

528
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:15,820
Oh, come on. Fine, just use- there you go.

529
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:34,820
Efficiency. I take it back.

530
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:54,820
I take it back when I said.

531
00:50:54,820 --> 00:51:14,820
Oh, man, I'm so not a gamer. You know, at the beginning of the game, where I was like, yeah, I'm gaming. I'm gaming, bros. I'm gaming Senpai. That was a lie.

532
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:34,820
Okay, I was in denial of my true strength. You know, I thought I had the ability, but turns out my ability that I had was a lie and that I was strongly overcompensating for my skills.

533
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:41,820
I thought I was a gamer. I thought I was. You know what? I lied. I lied. I'm not a gamer at all. You guys can't punish me for this.

534
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:50,820
My Senpais can't punish me for not being able to game, okay? Look at me. Look at me. This is because my hands are sweaty. Yeah, it's totally because my hands are sweaty.

535
00:51:50,820 --> 00:52:18,820
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

536
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:40,820
So does his legs not work now? This man's leg just doesn't work. All we can do is rely on these arms that seem to have the power of, of like a thousand who's like, who's able to hold on for, for dear life for such a long time.

537
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,820
Yeah.

538
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,820
Yeah.

539
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,820
Ah.

540
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,820
Ah.

541
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,820
Just grab on, man.

542
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,820
Well, yeah. Hiya.

543
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,820
Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya.

544
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,820
esperar

545
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,820
Yeah.

546
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,820
Meow.

547
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,820
Hi. Hi.

548
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:25,820
No, I want to be higher, right?

549
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:43,820
Maybe a bit higher?

550
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:51,820
Oh, maybe I should be more to the edge.

551
00:54:51,820 --> 00:55:09,820
Oh, he slips.

552
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:24,820
I forgot he slips.

553
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:49,820
I got spooked.

554
00:55:49,820 --> 00:56:05,820
Stop counting my falls!

555
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:30,820
I don't need to know the amount of times I fail. I just need to know the amount of times I win.

556
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:53,820
I know this is the beginning.

557
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:17,820
Stop bullying me!

558
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,820
Got it.

559
00:57:47,820 --> 00:58:15,820
There we go.

560
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:37,820
There we go.

561
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:53,820
It's fun! Slippery! Slippery!

562
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:59,820
Hmm.

563
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:11,820
Hmm.

564
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:32,820
Yeah!

565
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:56,820
This man just goes, brrr, cold.

566
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:25,820
Oh, brrr.

567
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:54,820
Oh, brrr.

568
01:00:54,820 --> 01:01:19,820
Oh, brrr.

569
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:48,820
This is a mean game. This is a rain game. I know it's a rain game. My man does not feel that great.

570
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:59,820
A hard but not impossible game is what they said. And I wanted to show off to Senpai that I could probably do it.

571
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:11,820
Right now I'm starting to question my life choices.

572
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:35,820
Senpai's must be better gamers than me.

573
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:55,820
Shut up, Amy!

574
01:02:55,820 --> 01:03:13,820
Easy. Easy your way.

575
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:24,820
I don't like that area. That area sucks. You know what? That sucks. That sucks balls. Okay?

576
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:53,820
I can't believe I fell at that part.

577
01:03:53,820 --> 01:04:22,820
Eh, eh, wah, wah, wah. Fuck you. Fuck this bullshit.

578
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:29,820
No.

579
01:04:53,820 --> 01:05:09,820
Hmm.

580
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:31,820
Hmm. Focus. Laser focus.

581
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:52,820
Laser focus.

582
01:05:52,820 --> 01:06:04,820
Hmm.

583
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:21,820
Maybe I need my hand like here.

584
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:43,820
Nyeh.

585
01:06:43,820 --> 01:07:12,820
Nyeh.

586
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:39,820
Nyeh.

587
01:07:39,820 --> 01:08:04,820
Nyeh.

588
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:19,820
Nyeh.

589
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:48,820
Nyeh.

590
01:08:49,820 --> 01:09:06,820
Nyeh.

591
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:28,820
Nyeh.

592
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:48,820
Nyeh.

593
01:09:48,820 --> 01:10:03,820
Nyeh.

594
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:19,820
Shut up. Shut up Senpai.

595
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:44,820
Okay, one handed gameplay.

596
01:10:44,820 --> 01:11:06,820
And a drink tea.

597
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:35,820
What do you think it is? By the way, it's an apple cinnamon. Apple cinnamon tea.

598
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:54,820
Oh yeah.

599
01:11:54,820 --> 01:12:04,820
Maybe I should have been here.

600
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:11,820
Just need to be brave.

601
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,820
I'm not brave.

602
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:36,820
Give me a second.

603
01:12:36,820 --> 01:13:02,820
Nyeh.

604
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:19,820
Nyeh.

605
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:48,820
Senpai, you're not tired of me, right? You still love me, right? Even though I'm a bad gamer?

606
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:58,820
Nyeh.

607
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:22,820
Nyeh.

608
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:36,820
I don't even know how physics work.

609
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:46,820
There's some games I'm good at you. I bet.

610
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:57,820
Like rock, paper, scissors maybe?

611
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:10,820
Visual novels are like, it's gameplay but it's not like gameplay, you know?

612
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:30,820
I can guess I'm okay at detective games and puzzle games, sort of.

613
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:50,820
Nyeh.

614
01:15:50,820 --> 01:16:19,820
Seriously, can I get these arms? How does this man not just buff in the arms?

615
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:47,820
Nessie. Oh yeah.

616
01:16:47,820 --> 01:17:05,820
Was it here? Or did I need to go down here? I can't remember.

617
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:32,820
Nyeh.

618
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:48,820
Hold on, I need to position this. That didn't count as a fall, I caught my way down.

619
01:17:48,820 --> 01:18:08,820
Okay, maybe that one did.

620
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:34,820
Senpai, this hurts my hand too much. I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

621
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:55,820
Because this hurts my hand a lot. I don't know if it's gonna work.

622
01:18:55,820 --> 01:19:22,820
This is kind of harder.

623
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:51,820
This is less precise.

624
01:19:51,820 --> 01:20:10,820
Just that my hand really hurt with the mouse. That's a little hard. I'll see what we can do.

625
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:35,820
He's dangling. This is harder.

626
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:43,820
It doesn't hurt my hand as much. This is gonna be a new learning curve.

627
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:28,820
A new learning curve, but it doesn't hurt my hand as much. Thank you for the dollar you do a day in white.

628
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:40,820
Oh gosh, this is so hard to control for the controller. I know it's technically easier on mouse, but...

629
01:21:40,820 --> 01:22:03,820
Mercy's hand's hurt.

630
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:39,820
I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

631
01:22:40,820 --> 01:23:09,820
This is so hard to control the hands. Look how much more flingy he is.

632
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:14,820
Oh no!

633
01:23:40,820 --> 01:24:09,820
I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

634
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:39,820
I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

635
01:24:40,820 --> 01:25:09,820
No, no, no, I have no idea.

636
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:39,820
I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

637
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:55,820
Learning the controller is so hard.

638
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:13,820
At least less hand pain, yeah. Oh my goodness.

639
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:24,820
Such a learning curve. I should definitely invest in a smaller mouse. What the heck? Why did I buy such a big, enormous thing?

640
01:26:43,820 --> 01:27:12,820
I don't know why I did that. What mouse? It's a HyperX. I bought it because it was pink. It actually kind of sucks, because it always disconnects.

641
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:35,820
Oh, come on.

642
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:40,820
Oh no!

643
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:24,820
Oh, it's not a wireless mouse. The mouse I got is a wired mouse. It disconnects all the time and I always have to go to the back of the PC and grab it because it sucks.

644
01:28:35,820 --> 01:29:04,820
Oh, come on.

645
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:14,820
This man swings too much.

646
01:29:35,820 --> 01:30:04,820
Let's try this part with the mouse instead.

647
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:28,820
Oh, come on.

648
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:44,820
Maybe try a different USB port. All my USB ports are taken, so there's only one place left for it.

649
01:30:44,820 --> 01:31:03,820
When I had my other mouse... I'm going back to mouse style. I'm sorry. It was just too hard.

650
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:14,820
When I had my other mouse, it worked just fine. Same ports, everything. It's just this HyperX1 freaking sucks.

651
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:48,820
Oh, come on.

652
01:31:48,820 --> 01:32:09,820
Oh, come on.

653
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:20,820
Thank you for the 420 King Chucky.

654
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:31,820
This is my Zatsu. Sorry, I'm just like super focused. Hyper, hyper, hyper focused.

655
01:32:50,820 --> 01:33:19,820
I'm going back to the mouse. It hurts me, but I can control it better.

656
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:35,820
That's it. I'm going to put a new mouse on my list. I was like, yeah, I wanted to be pink. I wanted it to be pink and cute and adorable so it can match all the rest of my stuff.

657
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:54,820
Oh, it sucks. Oh, whatever. I feel like...

658
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:32,820
Can I grab with Q? Like this? I guess this works.

659
01:34:32,820 --> 01:35:01,820
Okay, well, this works. I just have to remember which key is which.

660
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:29,820
I have to claw it. So that's good. Thank you.

661
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:58,820
Okay.

662
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:23,820
Why is this getting harder? Maybe it's because I'm getting more frustrated.

663
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:39,820
My favorite color is purple. I'm trying to get stuff to match purple and white, right? I guess aesthetics is important, in my opinion. I feel like if things around me are the colors that make me happy and I can be happy.

664
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:47,820
That's why I have all my dog cages to be super cute and pink and adorable. I painted them all cute colors.

665
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:20,820
Maybe here?

666
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:55,820
Are you not allowed to customize? You know how I said I like color coordination senpai? I like all my things to be color coordinated. Understood?

667
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:37,820
Yeah.

668
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:49,820
Just got to deal with the carpal tunnel.

669
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:59,820
Bitch.

670
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:29,820
Yeah.

671
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:59,820
Senpai, this part is hard. And this is the beginning.

672
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:39,820
I want to be a gamer, but I suck at gaming.

673
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:50,820
Son of a slut!

674
01:40:50,820 --> 01:41:06,820
I'm sorry for using bad words.

675
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:26,820
Don't worry.

676
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:36,820
Don't worry. I soundproofed everything. So, senpai. The neighbors won't normally hear me. Normally.

677
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:24,820
I don't mind a little back seating, but I really don't know where to go how to get to this part.

678
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:46,820
Do I swing here?

679
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:56,820
Do I swing with both arms? Like this? This?

680
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:36,820
Hmm. Kind of scary.

681
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:46,820
Do-do-do.

682
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:31,820
I don't know.

683
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:51,820
You slipped down more. Maybe I'm just stupid?

684
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:30,820
Instead of flipping, you mean like, hold on. Maybe you're on to something, senpai.

685
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:40,820
No, no, no, no!

686
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:20,820
I'm not a gamer. That's it. I relinquish that title for someone more worthy of such a title.

687
01:46:50,820 --> 01:47:06,820
I'm not a gamer.

688
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:16,820
Yep.

689
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:45,820
Okay.

690
01:47:45,820 --> 01:48:07,820
Now do the same as before, but let go slightly early so your body won't flip.

691
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:33,820
Why does everyone get stuck at the same part every time? Well, maybe that part is hard, senpai.

692
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:45,820
At this point, I'm not even watching it anymore. I'm just like, okay, well, this time I've already got a pattern sort of how to like do this.

693
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:56,820
Just this one part. One part. It gets harder. I know. But this one part, I just want to get past it. I just want to get past this one part.

694
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:28,820
It's deft doable, but like maybe I just don't know the trick to it, you know?

695
01:49:46,820 --> 01:50:05,820
We never lose, we never give up. This is what... This is what persistence is. Oh, shit. Ah, fuck.

696
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:25,820
Tenacity, persistence. I don't know what other words there are. I don't have a thesaurus on me.

697
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:54,820
Is it possible to head first instead of swinging? Honestly, I have no idea.

698
01:50:54,820 --> 01:51:12,820
Like, I would love to... I feel like I'm gonna flip, so I just... I don't know. I don't know, senpai. I don't know.

699
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:15,820
That one goes back down to the beginning.

700
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:44,820
I want to get closer but I'm also kind of worried that I won't be able to swing far enough.

701
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:48,820
Hmm?

702
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:06,820
I just made him do a weird shimmy! I just made him do the Stingin' Nansen!

703
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:09,820
Attarashi Gakkou!

704
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:14,820
Otona Blue.

705
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:16,820
Hup.

706
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:21,820
Alright.

707
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:40,820
Hmm. This part's hard. I'm... I don't know. Maybe I need to watch a video of someone doing it?

708
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:49,820
But I feel like that's cheating. I feel like that's cheating. And I'm not a cheater. I'm a quitter, but not a cheater!

709
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:55,820
I'm like, you guys! And I'm like, senpai's! Cheater, cheating.

710
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:18,820
Oh, shit.

711
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:21,820
Hmm.

712
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:22,820
Oh.

713
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:24,820
Hup.

714
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:26,820
Hup.

715
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:29,820
Hup.

716
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:40,820
Hup.

717
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:44,820
Hup.

718
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:47,820
Hup.

719
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:54,820
Hup.

720
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:14,820
I don't know which rock it is that I should... Like, I can't tell if I should be, like, trying this rock or this rock.

721
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,820
Hup.

722
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:26,820
Hup.

723
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:29,820
Hup.

724
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:35,820
Hup.

725
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:38,820
Hup.

726
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:44,820
Hup.

727
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:48,820
Buh!

728
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:53,820
Hup.

729
01:54:58,820 --> 01:54:59,820
Hup!

730
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:00,820
Hup!

731
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:06,820
He didn't hold on.

732
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:07,820
Hup.

733
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:26,820
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I almost had it and then I failed.

734
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:27,820
Hup.

735
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:32,820
Hup.

736
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:37,820
Hup.

737
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:40,820
Hup.

738
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:43,820
Hup.

739
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:49,820
I want such a hard area. I don't know why it's such a hard area.

740
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,820
I know why.

741
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,820
Game Devs Evil.

742
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:59,820
Why did I decide to play this game?

743
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:03,820
How many hours in? I'm nearly two hours in and I suck!

744
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:07,820
I recognize my weaknesses, Senpai. Do you recognize your weaknesses?

745
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:10,820
My weakness includes...

746
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:16,820
My weakness includes impatience!

747
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:21,820
But at the same time, I'm a little stubborn.

748
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:34,820
Hup.

749
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:43,820
There we go.

750
01:56:43,820 --> 01:57:12,300
I'm your greatest weakness, Senpai!

751
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:19,300
I think it was here.

752
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:29,380
So, uh, I didn't get it.

753
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:35,940
I didn't get it.

754
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:36,940
I'm back!

755
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:38,340
Did Mercy make it to the top?

756
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,780
No, we're back at the bottom, and now, well, we're in the bottom still.

757
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:56,380
Oh, he always slips there.

758
01:57:56,380 --> 01:58:00,580
I intercept back.

759
01:58:00,580 --> 01:58:01,580
We got this.

760
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:02,580
Yeah, we got this.

761
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:03,580
We still winning.

762
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:06,700
We're in the grind mindset.

763
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:22,420
Um, every day your life is, uh, uh, is a power tool made to rock?

764
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:24,580
I don't fucking know.

765
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:38,260
Oh, something about Northern Lion.

766
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:54,140
I mean, MC's bald, yeah.

767
01:58:54,140 --> 01:59:15,180
Sometimes I look at life and I go, what would, what would this bald man Northern Lion would

768
01:59:15,180 --> 01:59:16,180
say?

769
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:32,340
And I force it on to other people.

770
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:53,820
Something involving hammers, probably, and then I start getting angry and then maybe

771
01:59:53,820 --> 02:00:03,260
I'll use the hammers on Senpai.

772
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:04,260
Is it this?

773
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:06,340
I can't remember which rock it was.

774
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:08,500
Was it this rock?

775
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:22,140
Which rock did I vibe with Senpai?

776
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:25,900
I couldn't remember which rock I vibe with.

777
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:26,900
This one?

778
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:29,020
Is it this rock that I vibe with?

779
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:37,060
This one right here on the little corner, this little sliver?

780
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:38,380
Or did I go the one up?

781
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:39,380
No, go up.

782
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:40,380
Okay.

783
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:50,420
This was the one that I, I vibe with.

784
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:51,700
Bottom of the middle rock.

785
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:58,980
Was it this bottom of the middle rock that I vibe with?

786
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:01,580
This bottom.

787
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:02,580
This bottom.

788
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:17,540
And I'm not talking about, like, you know, a bit higher.

789
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:20,100
What about here was the vibe?

790
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:21,100
Alright.

791
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:30,100
That was not the vibe.

792
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:33,660
Me and you?

793
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:43,860
Well, I'm at the bottom here.

794
02:01:43,860 --> 02:01:47,700
Good check failed.

795
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:48,700
Every time.

796
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:50,900
I just don't like it.

797
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:55,900
It doesn't mesh with my karma.

798
02:01:55,900 --> 02:02:04,380
It just doesn't mesh with my karma Senpai.

799
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:18,820
That area is full of negative energy.

800
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:44,420
Really a Scorpio.

801
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:49,020
I don't know what else they say.

802
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:50,020
Oh man.

803
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:51,020
What if I get a rock?

804
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:55,700
I have like some, some, some like, some like rocks.

805
02:02:55,700 --> 02:03:00,380
And then what if I get a rock and then I pray to that rock and then be like, yes, let's

806
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:09,700
meditate on this rock so we can make this jump.

807
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:49,180
I swung.

808
02:03:49,180 --> 02:03:50,180
Was it not hard?

809
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:51,180
Air guitar.

810
02:03:51,180 --> 02:04:03,620
I don't know what I forgot what guitar sounds like because I don't really listen to music.

811
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:16,820
So in my mind, when you said like, oh, you air guitar down, I was like, air banjo, it's

812
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:17,820
dead.

813
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:29,820
It's like I'm in here or something.

814
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:59,340
Oh, unless we're talking about the guitar, is it a guitar?

815
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:01,980
I've been watching Yu Yu Hakusho.

816
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:04,580
So I have Yu Yu Hakusho brain rot right now.

817
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:15,260
So the sound effect.

818
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:16,260
Something happens.

819
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:25,260
Do you remember Senpai?

820
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:43,540
Right now I'm on the arc where the arc following what's his face's plan to open the kick kai

821
02:05:43,540 --> 02:06:07,980
barrier kick kai means barrier.

822
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:08,980
Yeah.

823
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:09,980
Right now we have.

824
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:11,820
Oh my gosh.

825
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:12,820
Close your ears.

826
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:17,980
Oh, close your ears right now.

827
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:24,100
Currently demon guy was like, I'm hungry, I can't take it anymore.

828
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:25,100
And that's where I'm at.

829
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:26,100
That's it.

830
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:27,100
That's the part I'm at.

831
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:52,460
Oh, I'm still scared Senpai.

832
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:53,460
I'm still scared.

833
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:55,500
I don't actually remember how I did it.

834
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:57,500
I don't remember how I did it.

835
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:20,500
Just do it.

836
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:30,500
Give me a second, let me test something.

837
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:36,500
Okay, I definitely swing back if I let go there.

838
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:40,500
I have to let go as I'm swinging.

839
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:47,500
Senpai!

840
02:07:47,500 --> 02:08:02,500
We did it!

841
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:08,500
Wow!

842
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:24,500
Huh, now I'm stuck.

843
02:08:54,500 --> 02:09:23,500
We live here now.

844
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,500
I'm sweating from my neck.

845
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:38,500
I can feel the sweat dripping down my neck right now.

846
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,500
This is where we live now.

847
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:56,500
We're home now.

848
02:09:56,500 --> 02:10:21,500
This is our rock.

849
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:45,500
This is where we live now.

850
02:10:45,500 --> 02:11:14,500
This is where we live now.

851
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:39,500
This is where we live now.

852
02:11:39,500 --> 02:12:07,500
This is where we live now.

853
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:08,500
That's all that mattered.

854
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:15,500
We peaked once.

855
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:23,500
We peaked once.

856
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:29,500
I was so close Senpai.

857
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:41,500
I was so close.

858
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:46,500
I didn't know I was slip and slide right there.

859
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:52,500
My slip and slide days.

860
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:55,500
I assume you're already familiar with getting over it.

861
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:58,500
Yeah, and guess what?

862
02:12:58,500 --> 02:13:00,500
I got over it.

863
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:02,500
Actually, I didn't get over it.

864
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:20,500
I got to the one area with all the curls and then I just gave up there.

865
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,500
I can't believe there was a slide there.

866
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:27,500
I was like, okay, just swing and then I...

867
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:29,500
I was like, okay, well, grab onto that area.

868
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:31,500
It'll be fine.

869
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:39,500
Slip and slide, baby.

870
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:40,500
Did you get to the anvil?

871
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:42,500
I think I got to the anvil.

872
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:48,500
I'm not sure.

873
02:13:48,500 --> 02:14:10,500
I made it to peak and then I fell off.

874
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:17,500
That's how it goes, right?

875
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:44,500
I fell off, literally.

876
02:14:44,500 --> 02:15:01,500
We can peak again.

877
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:02,500
I gave up.

878
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:05,500
I can't believe you would have that vocabulary in you, Mercy Modest.

879
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:07,500
Well, guess what?

880
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:08,500
I do.

881
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:12,500
I'm a quitter, but not a cheater.

882
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:18,500
Except for when cheating feels good in games.

883
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:20,500
Do you know Black Clover?

884
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,500
Does anyone know Black Clover?

885
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:24,500
I'm going to give you a spoiler.

886
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:27,500
When Asta, they were cheating in this tournament thing

887
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:31,500
and then Asta was like, you weren't cheating?

888
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:33,500
Why didn't you tell me I wanted to cheat, too?

889
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:44,500
And I felt that.

890
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:46,500
No, we're not cheating that way.

891
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:51,500
We're talking about cheating in games, you know?

892
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:57,500
The only cheaters I know is you, Senpai.

893
02:15:57,500 --> 02:16:05,500
That's why you have to cut off your fingers sometimes.

894
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:16,500
Oh my gosh, do not make this about NTR.

895
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:29,500
It's like you guys have brain rot.

896
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:31,500
It's like some Senpais have brain rot for NTR

897
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:38,500
and that's all they can think about.

898
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,500
You know what NTR I think about?

899
02:16:40,500 --> 02:17:04,500
New times, Romans.

900
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:11,500
I'm just saying.

901
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,500
I'm just saying.

902
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,500
I don't want questions about that anymore.

903
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:17,500
I don't want questions about that.

904
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,500
I want people to assume anything.

905
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:26,500
Why? Because I only love my Senpais.

906
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:28,500
New times, Romans, good.

907
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:43,500
It's a good font.

908
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:44,500
It's a good font.

909
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:55,500
I promise Senpais that I only have Senpai in my heart.

910
02:17:55,500 --> 02:18:07,500
And maybe Serenity, sorry.

911
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:27,500
Serenity in my gym mate, sorry.

912
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:47,500
See the power of my gen mates in Serenity.

913
02:18:47,500 --> 02:19:16,500
Serenity in my gym mate.

914
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:29,500
I feel like...

915
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:49,500
Can we get higher before?

916
02:19:49,500 --> 02:20:04,500
I slept.

917
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:17,500
I slept. That was scary.

918
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:30,500
By the power of Serenity and my gen mates Azra, Imi, Isi, Shibi, Strony.

919
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:54,500
I will make it.

920
02:20:54,500 --> 02:21:22,500
Oh no, my mouse is so sweaty.

921
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:42,500
My hands are making me sweat.

922
02:21:42,500 --> 02:22:08,500
My hands are making me sweat.

923
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:24,500
My hands are making me sweat.

924
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:40,500
I did it, I did it, I did it.

925
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:45,500
My gamer license has been reinstated.

926
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:53,500
I made progress but now my hands are really sweaty.

927
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:57,500
I'm super sweaty now.

928
02:22:57,500 --> 02:23:11,500
I might be a real gamer because of how sweaty I am.

929
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:13,500
I think I just flowed here for a little bit.

930
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:15,500
Look at my little oasis.

931
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:17,500
Yeah.

932
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:20,500
Yeah, my little oasis with my little waterfall.

933
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:23,500
I got these beautiful leaves.

934
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:25,500
This wonderful ambience.

935
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,500
Do you have any gamer gloves?

936
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:43,500
No.

937
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:45,500
We live here now.

938
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:54,500
Why would we want to go more?

939
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:57,500
I don't normally game this hard.

940
02:23:57,500 --> 02:23:59,500
Oh, the carpal tunnel though.

941
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:09,500
I feel it in my fingies.

942
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:11,500
I really feel it.

943
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:14,500
It's so sore now.

944
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:17,500
Can I save here?

945
02:24:17,500 --> 02:24:23,500
Am I allowed to save or does it start at the beginning again?

946
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:33,500
I don't know.

947
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:41,500
Carpal tunnel.

948
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:43,500
I'm so sweaty now.

949
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:54,500
My neck feels like a waterfall.

950
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:57,500
Where is the bath water?

951
02:24:57,500 --> 02:25:02,500
My bath is kind of small.

952
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:28,500
How do we get past here?

953
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:34,500
All of the roots, just be careful.

954
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:39,500
This is kind of scary.

955
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:48,500
These roots?

956
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:51,500
I don't feel safe out of my oasis.

957
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:57,500
I'm going back to my oasis.

958
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:03,500
I don't feel safe outside of my oasis.

959
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:06,500
That area was so dark.

960
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:12,500
I was like, this is an area that's dangerous.

961
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:22,500
We live here now.

962
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:29,500
This is where we live.

963
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:33,500
This oasis probably has fish, right?

964
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:43,500
We'll fish together some pie.

965
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:45,500
We can eat the leaves.

966
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:54,500
These are good nutritious leaves.

967
02:26:54,500 --> 02:27:00,500
You can probably be free in this area without your cages.

968
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:08,500
Where else would you go?

969
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:14,500
Why would you leave my oasis?

970
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:24,500
You can always go down.

971
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:34,500
I worked really hard to get here.

972
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:44,500
I'm going back to my oasis.

973
02:27:44,500 --> 02:28:10,500
I'm going back to my oasis.

974
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:35,500
I'm going back to my oasis.

975
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:48,500
I'm going back to my oasis.

976
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:52,500
This is where I live now.

977
02:28:52,500 --> 02:28:56,500
We all live here.

978
02:28:56,500 --> 02:29:11,500
We collect berries and go collecting berries.

979
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:15,500
This area looks dangerous.

980
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:25,500
I'm kind of scared of it.

981
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:49,500
How's the wi-fi here? I don't know. Check it.

982
02:29:49,500 --> 02:30:12,500
I think it's good.

983
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:20,500
We live here now.

984
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:30,500
Do I have to go for bush to bush?

985
02:30:50,500 --> 02:31:12,500
How do I get bush to bush?

986
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:28,500
Maybe this bush and then go to that bush.

987
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:32,500
Maybe that bush and we swing.

988
02:31:32,500 --> 02:31:34,500
I was already at that bush.

989
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:36,500
Is that the bush I was supposed to go to?

990
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:12,500
I don't know if I can reach that high.

991
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:22,500
I don't know if I can reach that high.

992
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:38,500
I don't know if I can reach that high.

993
02:32:38,500 --> 02:33:07,500
I'm stuck here.

994
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:09,500
We live here forever.

995
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:12,500
Why do we want to move anyways?

996
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:18,500
What is the climb?

997
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:42,500
No!

998
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:54,500
Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!

999
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,500
Senpai!

1000
02:33:56,500 --> 02:34:06,500
Shit!

1001
02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:16,500
Is it just me or are these not easy to reach?

1002
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:55,500
Is it just me or are these not easy to reach?

1003
02:34:55,500 --> 02:35:05,500
Is this going to break?

1004
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:35,500
I'm stuck here.

1005
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:45,500
Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!

1006
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:55,500
Senpai, I'm a gamer!

1007
02:35:55,500 --> 02:36:07,500
This looks dangerous.

1008
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:17,500
I don't think I'm ready for this yet.

1009
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:35,500
Water! Water safe! Water!

1010
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:45,500
This is scary Senpai!

1011
02:36:45,500 --> 02:36:51,500
This part is a part where everybody drops, don't they?

1012
02:36:51,500 --> 02:37:05,500
Oh god.

1013
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:41,500
I lost my home!

1014
02:37:41,500 --> 02:37:50,500
Look, he just floats.

1015
02:37:50,500 --> 02:38:18,500
Senpai, we're homeless again!

1016
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:23,500
Now the sea only tastes like salt.

1017
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:37,500
Where is that my tears?

1018
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:40,500
We live here now.

1019
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:42,500
That was it.

1020
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:43,500
I knew it.

1021
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:46,500
That sign was dangerous and I knew it and we all knew it.

1022
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:54,500
I'm too tired for this now.

1023
02:38:54,500 --> 02:38:56,500
We rage quit, yeah.

1024
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:58,500
Yeah, we rage.

1025
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:05,500
We rage quit.

1026
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:08,500
We live in a society.

1027
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:15,500
We live in a society where bald men who can't use their legs

1028
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:18,500
can't even find a home.

1029
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:25,500
The housing market is terrible.

1030
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:27,500
I made it to peak.

1031
02:39:27,500 --> 02:39:30,500
I made it to our little oasis.

1032
02:39:30,500 --> 02:39:34,500
I went past our little oasis because I wanted more.

1033
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:37,500
I should have just been happy with what I had.

1034
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:56,500
I just became so greedy.

1035
02:39:56,500 --> 02:40:03,500
We should have just lived in the oasis.

1036
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:12,500
We were homeowners.

1037
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:16,500
I don't know how long we were homeowners, but I wanted more.

1038
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:18,500
The Home Owners Association.

1039
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:23,500
I wanted to be the president of the Home Owners Association.

1040
02:40:23,500 --> 02:40:26,500
And then we just, we failed.

1041
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:29,500
We failed.

1042
02:40:29,500 --> 02:40:31,500
I'm so sad.

1043
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:33,500
So sad, Senpai.

1044
02:40:33,500 --> 02:40:35,500
But what did we learn from that?

1045
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:53,500
We learned that the power of friendship is the most powerful thing.

1046
02:40:53,500 --> 02:40:58,500
We wanted a house in this economy.

1047
02:40:58,500 --> 02:41:06,500
Heck, I was even, heck, I was even, I was even going to pay my mortgage.

1048
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:14,500
My mortgage with the climb.

1049
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:15,500
Are we only friends to Yuka?

1050
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:17,500
I know.

1051
02:41:17,500 --> 02:41:21,500
My Senpais are in a loving relationship with me.

1052
02:41:21,500 --> 02:41:25,500
My friendship is with my girls.

1053
02:41:25,500 --> 02:41:31,500
Girls.

1054
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:34,500
Well, thank you.

1055
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:38,500
Set up for the 420.

1056
02:41:38,500 --> 02:41:39,500
I really appreciate it.

1057
02:41:39,500 --> 02:41:40,500
You did your best.

1058
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:42,500
Thank you.

1059
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:48,500
Thank you so much.

1060
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:50,500
We have the down payment.

1061
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:54,500
And then we have to pay the principal.

1062
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:57,500
And then we have to fight the other homeowners.

1063
02:41:57,500 --> 02:42:03,500
We have to fight the businesses that want to convert the entire area into a BNB,

1064
02:42:03,500 --> 02:42:14,500
a BNB enterprise, an Airbnb enterprise.

1065
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:23,500
Man, homeownership's rough.

1066
02:42:23,500 --> 02:42:32,500
Corporal.

1067
02:42:32,500 --> 02:42:36,500
Corporal's always coming in, gentrifying the place.

1068
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:39,500
The homeowners association hates me.

1069
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:41,500
They hate me because I wear an eye patch.

1070
02:42:41,500 --> 02:42:48,500
That's it, right?

1071
02:42:48,500 --> 02:42:50,500
Although that is my dream, though.

1072
02:42:50,500 --> 02:42:52,500
I really do want to own my own place.

1073
02:42:52,500 --> 02:43:05,500
So I can have more freedom.

1074
02:43:05,500 --> 02:43:08,500
They won't even let me.

1075
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:17,500
The homeowners association won't even let me have pink curtains.

1076
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:18,500
I don't know.

1077
02:43:18,500 --> 02:43:25,500
Is those fancy apartments and flats?

1078
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:29,500
Do they have homeowners associations or whatever?

1079
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:35,500
Where they're like, you can't have colorful curtains.

1080
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:45,500
Because then it brings the property down.

1081
02:43:45,500 --> 02:43:47,500
Sacrilege, I know.

1082
02:43:47,500 --> 02:43:49,500
I want my pink curtains.

1083
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:51,500
Actually, my curtains are kind of like an off-white,

1084
02:43:51,500 --> 02:43:55,500
but they're like sheer and they look very ethereal.

1085
02:43:55,500 --> 02:44:04,500
Like a wedding dress, you know?

1086
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:06,500
Will there be a yard to play in?

1087
02:44:06,500 --> 02:44:07,500
I don't know.

1088
02:44:07,500 --> 02:44:10,500
I don't like, I don't really like taking care of yards.

1089
02:44:10,500 --> 02:44:13,500
I don't like mowing, you know?

1090
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:29,500
I don't like mowing.

1091
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:36,500
Tempies won't take care of the mowing.

1092
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:41,500
Off-light, off-light is prettier, I think.

1093
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:43,500
Look at my tempi.

1094
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:44,500
Let's be real.

1095
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:47,500
If I wore white, look at my skin tone.

1096
02:44:47,500 --> 02:44:50,500
I would be blinding you, right?

1097
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:55,500
I would be blinding you.

1098
02:44:55,500 --> 02:44:58,500
Tempies will do the landscaping?

1099
02:44:58,500 --> 02:44:59,500
Okay.

1100
02:44:59,500 --> 02:45:10,500
I want a fruit tree then.

1101
02:45:10,500 --> 02:45:12,500
I want a fruit tree so we can pick...

1102
02:45:12,500 --> 02:45:13,500
I don't know.

1103
02:45:13,500 --> 02:45:14,500
What grows on trees?

1104
02:45:14,500 --> 02:45:15,500
Apples?

1105
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:17,500
We can pick apples.

1106
02:45:17,500 --> 02:45:19,500
Apples in the...

1107
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:21,500
What time do apples...

1108
02:45:21,500 --> 02:45:23,500
What time are apples?

1109
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:26,500
That depends on the place, right?

1110
02:45:26,500 --> 02:45:32,500
What time are apples in season?

1111
02:45:32,500 --> 02:45:35,500
Speaking of...

1112
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:36,500
I want to tell you guys something.

1113
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:39,500
It's kind of dumb.

1114
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:42,500
But I was at a store.

1115
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:49,500
I was at a store and I overheard these girls talking.

1116
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:52,500
We can pick them in the fall then.

1117
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:54,500
We can pick the apples in the fall.

1118
02:45:54,500 --> 02:45:56,500
So I overheard these girls talking.

1119
02:45:56,500 --> 02:45:58,500
I think they're fairly young.

1120
02:45:58,500 --> 02:46:00,500
And they were talking about Animal Crossing.

1121
02:46:00,500 --> 02:46:01,500
And they were like,

1122
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:03,500
Why aren't there any strawberry trees?

1123
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:05,500
And I didn't have the heart to say

1124
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:09,500
Strawberry girls on bushes.

1125
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:11,500
I didn't have the heart to say it.

1126
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:14,500
I was listening and I was like...

1127
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:16,500
What am I...

1128
02:46:16,500 --> 02:46:21,500
That's the reason why I don't have it.

1129
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:34,500
I didn't have the heart to say it.

1130
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:40,500
I remember I used to own some little strawberry plants.

1131
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:42,500
I don't think they grow on vines.

1132
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:51,500
But they were definitely in these little...

1133
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:54,500
I guess tiny bushes like a little patch.

1134
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:56,500
Where you can just pick them up.

1135
02:46:56,500 --> 02:46:59,500
I remember Papa Mercy.

1136
02:46:59,500 --> 02:47:03,500
Papa Mercy.

1137
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:08,500
Decided to give them away as a gift to someone.

1138
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:09,500
And I was like,

1139
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:26,500
Damn, no more cute strawberry picking.

1140
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:32,500
I thought of some names for Mama and Papa.

1141
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:38,500
But I feel like I would just say Mama and Papa.

1142
02:47:38,500 --> 02:47:40,500
I think it would be really interesting though.

1143
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:41,500
What do you guys...

1144
02:47:41,500 --> 02:47:54,500
What does my sump ice think?

1145
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:56,500
I thought of some names.

1146
02:47:56,500 --> 02:48:04,500
Like their real names.

1147
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:08,500
Papa's name is Please and Mama's name is Forgiveness.

1148
02:48:08,500 --> 02:48:34,500
Please.

1149
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:35,500
Please.

1150
02:48:35,500 --> 02:48:36,500
Please.

1151
02:48:36,500 --> 02:48:39,500
And forgiveness, please.

1152
02:48:39,500 --> 02:48:40,500
It's hard to remember.

1153
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:41,500
What do you mean?

1154
02:48:41,500 --> 02:48:46,500
It's the last thing you say sometimes when you're about to die.

1155
02:48:46,500 --> 02:49:04,500
Or when you're caught cheating.

1156
02:49:04,500 --> 02:49:06,500
It was yes, forgiveness.

1157
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:07,500
I don't know.

1158
02:49:07,500 --> 02:49:09,500
Maybe like forgive me.

1159
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:16,500
But like forgiveness.

1160
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:18,500
Like dearest for mommy.

1161
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:24,500
Mommy dearest.

1162
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:28,500
Was Papa Mama Senpai?

1163
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:30,500
She can be a little possessive of them.

1164
02:49:30,500 --> 02:49:33,500
Yeah.

1165
02:49:33,500 --> 02:49:38,500
Yeah, please, plus forgiveness equals mercy.

1166
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:50,500
I'm just going full meta right now.

1167
02:49:51,500 --> 02:49:56,500
It never dead Rückney again.

1168
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:58,500
Please.

1169
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:02,500
Please and forgive

1170
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:10,500
For you sounds like sounds like I forgot

1171
02:50:13,500 --> 02:50:15,500
I forgot

1172
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:20,500
I forgive

1173
02:50:21,500 --> 02:50:23,500
Ha ha ha ha ha

1174
02:50:27,500 --> 02:50:30,500
Maybe Mama and Papa Mercy would be good

1175
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:34,500
Ha ha ha ha

1176
02:50:36,500 --> 02:50:38,500
Ha ha ha ha ha

1177
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:44,500
Yeah, Mama and Papa would try explaining every time

1178
02:50:44,500 --> 02:50:48,500
Well, at least you guys get to know Mama and Papa's name

1179
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:52,500
That means you're ready for when you can pop the question

1180
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:57,500
and ask for their permission to marry their daughter, right?

1181
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:02,500
Ha ha ha

1182
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:10,500
So you're ready, but it's not time yet

1183
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:15,500
Ha ha ha ha ha

1184
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:23,500
Mama Mercy, Mama Modisse is too good to replace

1185
02:51:23,500 --> 02:51:24,500
Hmm, okay

1186
02:51:24,500 --> 02:51:26,500
We're thinking about marriage

1187
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:31,500
Were you, were you not thinking about marriage?

1188
02:51:32,500 --> 02:51:33,500
Hello?

1189
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:36,500
Hello?

1190
02:51:36,500 --> 02:51:37,500
Hello?

1191
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:47,500
That won't be the right time

1192
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:49,500
Well, we have to go on so many dates first

1193
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:52,500
Then we have to get to know each other way more

1194
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:55,500
And then, you know

1195
02:51:57,500 --> 02:51:58,500
You know

1196
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:00,500
You know

1197
02:52:00,500 --> 02:52:02,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1198
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:04,500
Ha ha ha ha

1199
02:52:10,500 --> 02:52:12,500
One thing at a time

1200
02:52:20,500 --> 02:52:23,500
So we can go on dates on the outside, of course

1201
02:52:24,500 --> 02:52:27,500
Unless you're trying to find help

1202
02:52:27,500 --> 02:52:29,500
No one will help you some pie

1203
02:52:29,500 --> 02:52:31,500
Only I will

1204
02:52:36,500 --> 02:52:38,500
This was a rock climbing date

1205
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:41,500
This was us trying to find a home, okay?

1206
02:52:41,500 --> 02:52:44,500
This was us trying to find a home

1207
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:45,500
Ha ha ha ha

1208
02:52:45,500 --> 02:52:47,500
This was us climbing

1209
02:52:47,500 --> 02:52:50,500
Climbing to find a home

1210
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:51,500
To get a mortgage

1211
02:52:51,500 --> 02:52:53,500
To pay the principal

1212
02:52:54,500 --> 02:52:56,500
Get a down payment

1213
02:52:56,500 --> 02:52:59,500
Then we got kicked out by the homeowners association

1214
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:05,500
Ha ha ha ha

1215
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:09,500
Ha ha ha ha

1216
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:11,500
I mean like

1217
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:14,500
The basement's getting a little bit crowded, right?

1218
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:18,500
Some, some senpais have to share cages

1219
02:53:21,500 --> 02:53:25,500
So for now, we're gonna have to have a homeless date

1220
02:53:25,500 --> 02:53:28,500
No, we're gonna just move back into the basement now

1221
02:53:28,500 --> 02:53:30,500
Ha ha ha ha

1222
02:53:32,500 --> 02:53:35,500
We're just gonna have to move back into the basement

1223
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:36,500
Ugh

1224
02:53:36,500 --> 02:53:38,500
Sadge

1225
02:53:39,500 --> 02:53:41,500
Ha ha ha ha ha

1226
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:44,500
Well

1227
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:48,500
Tomorrow I get to pick out date outfits

1228
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:49,500
For my senpais

1229
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:50,500
Not my senpais

1230
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:51,500
Oh, I'm so sorry

1231
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:53,500
I have senpai brain rot right now

1232
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:55,500
For my gen mates, my girls

1233
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:58,500
That will be kind of like

1234
02:53:58,500 --> 02:54:01,500
You know, we're getting ready for our first date with everyone

1235
02:54:06,500 --> 02:54:07,500
Ha ha ha

1236
02:54:08,500 --> 02:54:11,500
What about a 5k twitter audio?

1237
02:54:15,500 --> 02:54:16,500
To be honest

1238
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:18,500
Um

1239
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:23,500
I grew so fast

1240
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:25,500
I'm getting kind of scared

1241
02:54:27,500 --> 02:54:29,500
I'm getting kind of scared

1242
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:31,500
I think it's more eyes on me

1243
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:33,500
So I'm getting a little bit more shy

1244
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:39,500
I'm getting a little bit more shy

1245
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:43,500
Ha ha ha ha

1246
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:45,500
So because I'm getting a little bit more shy

1247
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:49,500
I'm getting a little bit more nervous to post a new audio

1248
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:55,500
So which is why I'm just like

1249
02:54:55,500 --> 02:54:57,500
Oh, I don't know

1250
02:54:57,500 --> 02:54:58,500
I wanna treat my senpais

1251
02:54:58,500 --> 02:55:01,500
But I feel like some people amongst

1252
02:55:03,500 --> 02:55:06,500
I'm gonna share an intimate moment

1253
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:10,500
But like maybe someone's gonna be spying on my intimate moment

1254
02:55:10,500 --> 02:55:11,500
With my senpais

1255
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:14,500
Ha ha ha

1256
02:55:16,500 --> 02:55:17,500
I guess

1257
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:23,500
It might take a little bit

1258
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:26,500
I said soon, but it might be more like later

1259
02:55:32,500 --> 02:55:34,500
It might be more like later

1260
02:55:34,500 --> 02:55:36,500
I'm too shy right now

1261
02:55:42,500 --> 02:55:43,500
I'm too shy right now

1262
02:55:43,500 --> 02:55:45,500
I was honestly

1263
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:47,500
You know, I went to bed and I was like

1264
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:48,500
Okay, 3k

1265
02:55:48,500 --> 02:55:50,500
Yeah, that's doable

1266
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:52,500
Cool, I knew senpais

1267
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:53,500
And then

1268
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:55,500
I woke up and I was like

1269
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:57,500
Oh, it went up to 4k

1270
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:01,500
I woke up because of the call

1271
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:03,500
Call of

1272
02:56:03,500 --> 02:56:05,500
About like my water being turned off

1273
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:07,500
And I was like, okay

1274
02:56:07,500 --> 02:56:09,500
And then I was like

1275
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:11,500
I'll go back to bed

1276
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:14,500
And then, you know, I'll do it later

1277
02:56:14,500 --> 02:56:16,500
And then I woke up

1278
02:56:18,500 --> 02:56:19,500
To 6k

1279
02:56:19,500 --> 02:56:20,500
So basically

1280
02:56:20,500 --> 02:56:22,500
Almost double

1281
02:56:23,500 --> 02:56:24,500
Double

1282
02:56:26,500 --> 02:56:28,500
Of what I like originally

1283
02:56:28,500 --> 02:56:29,500
Was like, oh

1284
02:56:34,500 --> 02:56:36,500
I know Shibi

1285
02:56:36,500 --> 02:56:38,500
Got grew really fast as well

1286
02:56:38,500 --> 02:56:40,500
I think I accidentally found

1287
02:56:40,500 --> 02:56:42,500
The algorithm

1288
02:56:45,500 --> 02:56:47,500
I accidentally found the algorithm

1289
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:49,500
I didn't even realize

1290
02:56:49,500 --> 02:56:51,500
I just, I was like

1291
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:52,500
Originally

1292
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:53,500
At 2k

1293
02:56:53,500 --> 02:56:54,500
I was like, oh

1294
02:56:54,500 --> 02:56:56,500
There's some vtubers following me

1295
02:56:56,500 --> 02:56:58,500
I should probably remind

1296
02:56:58,500 --> 02:57:00,500
Remind my vtuber

1297
02:57:00,500 --> 02:57:02,500
The vtubers following me that like

1298
02:57:02,500 --> 02:57:04,500
You know, not to be surprised

1299
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:05,500
If there's

1300
02:57:05,500 --> 02:57:06,500
There's something

1301
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:08,500
A little suss

1302
02:57:08,500 --> 02:57:10,500
Suss on there, but

1303
02:57:15,500 --> 02:57:16,500
Yeah

1304
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:18,500
Like honestly, I'm

1305
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:20,500
I'm a little

1306
02:57:20,500 --> 02:57:21,500
Nervous

1307
02:57:21,500 --> 02:57:23,500
A little lot nervous

1308
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:39,500
What about Strony?

1309
02:57:41,500 --> 02:57:43,500
Wait is Strony still streaming?

1310
02:57:53,500 --> 02:57:55,500
Yeah, the vtubers supporting me

1311
02:57:55,500 --> 02:57:56,500
Are pretty base

1312
02:57:56,500 --> 02:57:57,500
I was like, oh

1313
02:57:57,500 --> 02:57:58,500
They're really, oh

1314
02:57:58,500 --> 02:57:59,500
They're really cute

1315
02:57:59,500 --> 02:58:00,500
I wanna like

1316
02:58:00,500 --> 02:58:01,500
You know

1317
02:58:01,500 --> 02:58:03,500
Still maintain a knot

1318
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:08,500
She wants to raid in

1319
02:58:08,500 --> 02:58:09,500
But not sure if you're ending soon

1320
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:11,500
This might turn into a long, longer

1321
02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:12,500
Yap, I'm sorry

1322
02:58:14,500 --> 02:58:15,500
Yeah, she's fine

1323
02:58:15,500 --> 02:58:16,500
If she wants to raid in

1324
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:18,500
This might turn into a like

1325
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:20,500
Maybe another hour long

1326
02:58:24,500 --> 02:58:25,500
You know, yap

1327
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:35,500
Strony's definitely built different

1328
02:58:35,500 --> 02:58:37,500
I thought I had a pretty

1329
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:39,500
Strong, um

1330
02:58:42,500 --> 02:58:44,500
I thought I had a pretty strong stamina

1331
02:58:44,500 --> 02:58:47,500
But I think Strony has like a stronger stamina

1332
02:58:52,500 --> 02:58:54,500
I'm of course fine with

1333
02:58:54,500 --> 02:58:56,500
Going just

1334
02:58:56,500 --> 02:58:59,500
If Senpai's are okay with me being a little sweaty

1335
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:00,500
Hahaha

1336
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:06,500
If I'm a little sweaty

1337
02:59:18,500 --> 02:59:20,500
Sweaty's good, yeah

1338
02:59:21,500 --> 02:59:23,500
Strony did an 8 plus hour stream

1339
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:24,500
3 days in a row

1340
02:59:24,500 --> 02:59:26,500
Strony's too powerful

1341
02:59:26,500 --> 02:59:27,500
Honestly

1342
02:59:28,500 --> 02:59:31,500
How long, how long was today?

1343
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:32,500
It's like

1344
02:59:36,500 --> 02:59:39,500
It's like basically a new day

1345
02:59:42,500 --> 02:59:44,500
12 hours, wild honestly

1346
02:59:44,500 --> 02:59:45,500
Did she take breaks?

1347
02:59:45,500 --> 02:59:47,500
I hope she took breaks

1348
02:59:48,500 --> 02:59:51,500
Yeah, I want Strony to take

1349
02:59:51,500 --> 02:59:52,500
Lost a rest

1350
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:54,500
Honestly, Strony works really hard

1351
02:59:55,500 --> 02:59:56,500
Especially for us

1352
02:59:57,500 --> 02:59:58,500
Hahaha

1353
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:05,500
That's wild

1354
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:07,500
That's wild

1355
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:09,500
I don't know if I have that stamina

1356
03:00:09,500 --> 03:00:11,500
Honestly, usually

1357
03:00:11,500 --> 03:00:13,500
People

1358
03:00:13,500 --> 03:00:15,500
People like save such long streams

1359
03:00:15,500 --> 03:00:17,500
For like, uh

1360
03:00:17,500 --> 03:00:18,500
What's the word?

1361
03:00:18,500 --> 03:00:20,500
Endurance, endurance streams?

1362
03:00:24,500 --> 03:00:26,500
She only literally ate once?

1363
03:00:27,500 --> 03:00:29,500
Somebody yell at my

1364
03:00:29,500 --> 03:00:30,500
Yell at Mame

1365
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:33,500
Somebody yell at Mame to eat real food

1366
03:00:36,500 --> 03:00:38,500
I'm kind of like my

1367
03:00:38,500 --> 03:00:40,500
I'm kind of doing my limit

1368
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:43,500
Of maybe like 4 hours, 5 hours max

1369
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:45,500
Otherwise

1370
03:00:47,500 --> 03:00:49,500
I feel like

1371
03:00:49,500 --> 03:00:52,500
I feel like I'm going to overwork my mods

1372
03:00:53,500 --> 03:00:56,500
I feel like I'll overwork the mods

1373
03:00:56,500 --> 03:00:58,500
If that happens

1374
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:04,500
Let's go

1375
03:01:04,500 --> 03:01:06,500
Oh, Strony

1376
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:08,500
Strony, Strony

1377
03:01:08,500 --> 03:01:10,500
I love Strony

1378
03:01:10,500 --> 03:01:11,500
If Strony loves me

1379
03:01:11,500 --> 03:01:13,500
Then I love her

1380
03:01:15,500 --> 03:01:16,500
Welcome Raiders

1381
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:18,500
Welcome to the stream

1382
03:01:19,500 --> 03:01:21,500
We lost our home

1383
03:01:21,500 --> 03:01:22,500
Hahaha

1384
03:01:24,500 --> 03:01:25,500
Reflings raid

1385
03:01:25,500 --> 03:01:26,500
Yay

1386
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:27,500
Take it away, Mercy

1387
03:01:27,500 --> 03:01:28,500
Thank you, Strony

1388
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:30,500
Please rest up and eat real food

1389
03:01:30,500 --> 03:01:32,500
Or well, eat real food later

1390
03:01:32,500 --> 03:01:33,500
I don't know

1391
03:01:33,500 --> 03:01:34,500
It's your choice

1392
03:01:39,500 --> 03:01:40,500
Hahaha

1393
03:01:40,500 --> 03:01:42,500
I'm pretty sure Mame

1394
03:01:42,500 --> 03:01:45,500
Mame is going to pass the heck out right now

1395
03:01:47,500 --> 03:01:49,500
Yeah, we lost our home

1396
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:51,500
We lost our home, Reflings

1397
03:01:51,500 --> 03:01:53,500
We lost our home

1398
03:01:53,500 --> 03:01:55,500
I was in a nice oasis

1399
03:01:55,500 --> 03:01:56,500
I wanted more

1400
03:01:56,500 --> 03:01:59,500
Got kicked out by the Homeowners Association

1401
03:01:59,500 --> 03:02:00,500
Hahaha

1402
03:02:04,500 --> 03:02:05,500
Eat real food

1403
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:07,500
Me with cheeky macas

1404
03:02:07,500 --> 03:02:09,500
And my tum-tum

1405
03:02:09,500 --> 03:02:10,500
Mercy, love

1406
03:02:10,500 --> 03:02:11,500
I go sleepy time

1407
03:02:11,500 --> 03:02:13,500
Okay, have good rest

1408
03:02:13,500 --> 03:02:14,500
Mame

1409
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:17,500
Here's a kiss for you

1410
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:19,500
I'll tuck you in

1411
03:02:24,500 --> 03:02:25,500
Hahaha

1412
03:02:28,500 --> 03:02:29,500
Hi

1413
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:32,500
I actually had a craving for McDonald's last night

1414
03:02:33,500 --> 03:02:34,500
I actually went out

1415
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:37,500
I drove to McDonald's last night

1416
03:02:37,500 --> 03:02:38,500
And

1417
03:02:38,500 --> 03:02:39,500
I didn't

1418
03:02:40,500 --> 03:02:42,500
I had a very specific craving

1419
03:02:42,500 --> 03:02:44,500
I had a very specific craving

1420
03:02:44,500 --> 03:02:46,500
Which was I really wanted their

1421
03:02:46,500 --> 03:02:48,500
Nes-T

1422
03:02:48,500 --> 03:02:50,500
Their Nes-T drink

1423
03:02:54,500 --> 03:02:56,500
I really wanted their Nes-T drink

1424
03:02:56,500 --> 03:02:59,500
So I got myself like a large Nes-T

1425
03:02:59,500 --> 03:03:00,500
Hahaha

1426
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:01,500
I don't know

1427
03:03:01,500 --> 03:03:03,500
I feel like the fountain drinks

1428
03:03:03,500 --> 03:03:05,500
At McDonald's taste different, right?

1429
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:15,500
Hahaha

1430
03:03:16,500 --> 03:03:17,500
That's very specific

1431
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:18,500
I had a craving for it

1432
03:03:18,500 --> 03:03:20,500
I had a really big craving for it

1433
03:03:20,500 --> 03:03:22,500
I was like, I need this right now

1434
03:03:22,500 --> 03:03:24,500
And there's one about like

1435
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:27,500
Like a five minute drive away

1436
03:03:27,500 --> 03:03:29,500
And they have a 24 hour drive through

1437
03:03:29,500 --> 03:03:31,500
So I was like, can I please

1438
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:34,500
Have a large fountain drink

1439
03:03:35,500 --> 03:03:36,500
Hahaha

1440
03:03:36,500 --> 03:03:37,500
Hahaha

1441
03:03:43,500 --> 03:03:44,500
So

1442
03:03:44,500 --> 03:03:47,500
That's what I wanted

1443
03:03:47,500 --> 03:03:49,500
Specifically

1444
03:03:49,500 --> 03:03:50,500
Hahaha

1445
03:03:52,500 --> 03:03:54,500
And they were like, that's it

1446
03:03:54,500 --> 03:03:56,500
And I said, yep, that's it

1447
03:03:57,500 --> 03:03:59,500
How much is it?

1448
03:04:00,500 --> 03:04:01,500
Paid the price

1449
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:05,500
Parked in the parking lot

1450
03:04:05,500 --> 03:04:07,500
Took a few sips

1451
03:04:08,500 --> 03:04:10,500
Started dissociating

1452
03:04:11,500 --> 03:04:13,500
Wondered about life

1453
03:04:13,500 --> 03:04:15,500
Pried a little bit

1454
03:04:15,500 --> 03:04:17,500
Went back home

1455
03:04:18,500 --> 03:04:19,500
Kicked on my supplies

1456
03:04:19,500 --> 03:04:21,500
They were all sleeping nice

1457
03:04:21,500 --> 03:04:22,500
Hahaha

1458
03:04:22,500 --> 03:04:24,500
And I went to bed

1459
03:04:24,500 --> 03:04:25,500
Hahaha

1460
03:04:29,500 --> 03:04:31,500
Hahaha

1461
03:04:31,500 --> 03:04:32,500
Hahaha

1462
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:36,500
Bounds Marvin

1463
03:04:36,500 --> 03:04:38,500
Ah, it happens sometimes

1464
03:04:38,500 --> 03:04:40,500
I'm in a little bit of a

1465
03:04:41,500 --> 03:04:43,500
I'm in a little bit of a downer mood

1466
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:45,500
Not thing in per

1467
03:04:46,500 --> 03:04:48,500
Maybe it is something in particular

1468
03:04:50,500 --> 03:04:52,500
I think it's just

1469
03:04:53,500 --> 03:04:54,500
I don't know

1470
03:04:55,500 --> 03:04:57,500
I guess it's a bit of a

1471
03:04:57,500 --> 03:04:58,500
Imposter syndrome?

1472
03:04:58,500 --> 03:04:59,500
Yeah

1473
03:04:59,500 --> 03:05:01,500
I was feeling down because of the imposter syndrome

1474
03:05:08,500 --> 03:05:09,500
Hahaha

1475
03:05:13,500 --> 03:05:15,500
So then I was like, oh

1476
03:05:16,500 --> 03:05:18,500
You know, going through

1477
03:05:18,500 --> 03:05:20,500
Going through the motions

1478
03:05:20,500 --> 03:05:22,500
Like literally, I go through the motions

1479
03:05:22,500 --> 03:05:24,500
And then I get sad

1480
03:05:26,500 --> 03:05:28,500
You know, I should be happy with my growth

1481
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:30,500
But I'm like a little scared of it

1482
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:31,500
Hahaha

1483
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:37,500
I'm a little scared of it because

1484
03:05:42,500 --> 03:05:45,500
I've never had so many eyes on me before

1485
03:05:45,500 --> 03:05:46,500
Hahaha

1486
03:05:47,500 --> 03:05:48,500
So now I get a little shy

1487
03:05:48,500 --> 03:05:49,500
I get really shy

1488
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:51,500
And I'm like, oh

1489
03:05:51,500 --> 03:05:53,500
Should I think more about what I do?

1490
03:05:58,500 --> 03:05:59,500
Hahaha

1491
03:06:02,500 --> 03:06:04,500
Yeah, we did talk about the

1492
03:06:04,500 --> 03:06:06,500
Love reading how wrong the chat summary can be

1493
03:06:06,500 --> 03:06:09,500
Apparently chat is talking about wanting her to go live

1494
03:06:09,500 --> 03:06:11,500
And her talking about her hatred for

1495
03:06:11,500 --> 03:06:13,500
Homeowners Association and love for McDonald's

1496
03:06:13,500 --> 03:06:16,500
Well, we got the Homeowners Association

1497
03:06:16,500 --> 03:06:17,500
Things are afraid

1498
03:06:17,500 --> 03:06:18,500
Hahaha

1499
03:06:19,500 --> 03:06:21,500
It was a metaphor

1500
03:06:21,500 --> 03:06:22,500
It was a metaphor

1501
03:06:23,500 --> 03:06:24,500
Hahaha

1502
03:06:24,500 --> 03:06:25,500
Oh

1503
03:06:28,500 --> 03:06:29,500
Hahaha

1504
03:06:32,500 --> 03:06:34,500
It was a metaphor

1505
03:06:34,500 --> 03:06:36,500
We got to an oasis

1506
03:06:36,500 --> 03:06:38,500
In a difficult game about climbing

1507
03:06:40,500 --> 03:06:41,500
Hahaha

1508
03:06:41,500 --> 03:06:43,500
And then I wanted more

1509
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:45,500
And then I got kicked out

1510
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:47,500
Oh, some pie

1511
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:49,500
Thank you for the $4 news

1512
03:06:49,500 --> 03:06:51,500
What's the word for the day?

1513
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:55,500
What's the word of the day for English again?

1514
03:06:55,500 --> 03:06:56,500
Hmm, let me think

1515
03:06:59,500 --> 03:07:00,500
Dichotomy

1516
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:02,500
Hahaha

1517
03:07:03,500 --> 03:07:05,500
Word of the day is dichotomy

1518
03:07:06,500 --> 03:07:07,500
Hahaha

1519
03:07:12,500 --> 03:07:13,500
Hahaha

1520
03:07:14,500 --> 03:07:15,500
Hahaha

1521
03:07:18,500 --> 03:07:19,500
Another D word

1522
03:07:20,500 --> 03:07:21,500
Hahaha

1523
03:07:21,500 --> 03:07:24,500
Maybe I just have like the D dictionary in my head

1524
03:07:24,500 --> 03:07:25,500
Hahaha

1525
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:30,500
Hahaha

1526
03:07:33,500 --> 03:07:34,500
Here

1527
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:44,500
Dichotomy

1528
03:07:44,500 --> 03:07:47,500
A division or contrast between two things

1529
03:07:47,500 --> 03:07:51,500
That are or are represented by being opposed

1530
03:07:51,500 --> 03:07:53,500
Or entirely different

1531
03:07:53,500 --> 03:07:55,500
An example would be a rigid dichotomy

1532
03:07:55,500 --> 03:07:58,500
Rigid dichotomy between science and mysticism

1533
03:07:59,500 --> 03:08:00,500
Hahaha

1534
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:09,500
Dichotomy between the oasis

1535
03:08:09,500 --> 03:08:11,500
And the Homeowners Association

1536
03:08:11,500 --> 03:08:12,500
It makes sense

1537
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:13,500
Hahaha

1538
03:08:17,500 --> 03:08:19,500
I have D on the brain

1539
03:08:19,500 --> 03:08:20,500
Maybe

1540
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:21,500
Hahaha

1541
03:08:22,500 --> 03:08:23,500
Hahaha

1542
03:08:25,500 --> 03:08:26,500
Hahaha

1543
03:08:30,500 --> 03:08:31,500
Hahaha

1544
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:32,500
I don't know

1545
03:08:32,500 --> 03:08:33,500
I just picked a word

1546
03:08:33,500 --> 03:08:34,500
I just picked a word

1547
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:35,500
I was like, I don't know

1548
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:36,500
It sounds nice right now

1549
03:08:36,500 --> 03:08:37,500
Hahaha

1550
03:08:38,500 --> 03:08:39,500
Hahaha

1551
03:08:41,500 --> 03:08:42,500
I would

1552
03:08:43,500 --> 03:08:44,500
Oh

1553
03:08:44,500 --> 03:08:47,500
Are there people who are new here that wasn't here for the last three?

1554
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:51,500
Mama and Papa Mercy

1555
03:08:51,500 --> 03:08:53,500
I tried to explain multiple times

1556
03:08:53,500 --> 03:08:54,500
Mama and Papa Mercy

1557
03:08:56,500 --> 03:08:59,500
Somehow got in their heads

1558
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:01,500

1559
03:09:01,500 --> 03:09:04,500

Online

1561
03:09:05,500 --> 03:09:06,500
Hahaha

1562
03:09:10,500 --> 03:09:11,500
Hahaha

1563
03:09:21,500 --> 03:09:22,500
Hahaha

1564
03:09:25,500 --> 03:09:26,500
Hahaha

1565
03:09:26,500 --> 03:09:27,500
Yeah

1566
03:09:27,500 --> 03:09:29,500
So my supplies are

1567
03:09:29,500 --> 03:09:31,500
Are my students?

1568
03:09:32,500 --> 03:09:33,500

And I like play games

03:09:43,500 --> 03:09:46,500
And you know I make audios

1578
03:09:47,500 --> 03:09:50,500
And you know it's like

1579
03:09:50,500 --> 03:09:51,500
It's like I don't know

03:09:51,500 --> 03:09:53,500

03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:20,500
I always knew you all

Can you tell them to make it work again?

1605
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:42,500

Would you say you have old parents

1626
03:11:44,500 --> 03:11:46,500
Or just super innocent?

1627
03:11:48,500 --> 03:11:50,500
Maybe a bit amicable

1628
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:52,500
Umm

1629
03:11:52,500 --> 03:11:54,500
They're very

03:11:54,500 --> 03:11:56,500
They were very strict with me

1631
03:11:56,500 --> 03:11:58,500
They were very strict with me

1632
03:11:58,500 --> 03:12:00,500
But like suddenly

1633
03:12:00,500 --> 03:12:01,500
I got like

03:12:01,500 --> 03:12:03,500
They're like you're an adult now

03:12:36,500 --> 03:12:38,500
Hahaha

1649
03:12:42,500 --> 03:12:44,500

But I do respect manager

1657
03:13:12,500 --> 03:13:14,500
Manager is what

1658
03:13:14,500 --> 03:13:16,500
Rains us in

1659
03:13:16,500 --> 03:13:18,500
Hahaha

1660
03:13:21,500 --> 03:13:23,500
Hahaha

1661
03:13:23,500 --> 03:13:25,500
Manager is what rains us in

1662
03:13:25,500 --> 03:13:27,500
So we can be free

1663
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:34,500
Hahaha

1664
03:13:34,500 --> 03:13:35,500
So we can be free

1665
03:13:35,500 --> 03:13:37,500
To a certain extent

1666
03:13:41,500 --> 03:13:43,500
It's manager Senpai

1667
03:13:43,500 --> 03:13:45,500
Or no manager is manager

1668
03:13:50,500 --> 03:13:52,500
Discussing sounds

1669
03:13:56,500 --> 03:13:58,500
Manager is manager

1670
03:13:58,500 --> 03:14:00,500
Hahaha

1671
03:14:00,500 --> 03:14:01,500
Senpai on the other hand

1672
03:14:01,500 --> 03:14:03,500
I love Senpai

1673
03:14:10,500 --> 03:14:12,500
Ironically I think they copy and pasted

1674
03:14:12,500 --> 03:14:13,500
Icy's description

1675
03:14:13,500 --> 03:14:15,500
So Icy was missing from the list of gen mates

1676
03:14:15,500 --> 03:14:17,500
That's probably why

1677
03:14:17,500 --> 03:14:20,500
Efficiency comes at the cost

1678
03:14:20,500 --> 03:14:22,500
And the cost is

1679
03:14:22,500 --> 03:14:24,500
You know some details

1680
03:14:27,500 --> 03:14:29,500
Would you love us even if we were a worm?

1681
03:14:29,500 --> 03:14:31,500
Yes of course

1682
03:14:31,500 --> 03:14:33,500
You'll be the cutest worm ever

1683
03:14:33,500 --> 03:14:35,500
Hahaha

1684
03:14:39,500 --> 03:14:41,500
Thank you

1685
03:14:41,500 --> 03:14:43,500
By the two dollary dudes

1686
03:14:43,500 --> 03:14:45,500
Teach me some pie

1687
03:14:45,500 --> 03:14:47,500
What am I teaching?

1688
03:14:47,500 --> 03:14:49,500
More words?

1689
03:14:49,500 --> 03:14:51,500
Hahaha

1690
03:14:53,500 --> 03:14:55,500
Can I be a gummy worm?

1691
03:14:55,500 --> 03:14:58,500
Yeah gummy worm is natural cage habitat

1692
03:14:58,500 --> 03:15:00,500
Hahaha

1693
03:15:04,500 --> 03:15:05,500
It's probably it

1694
03:15:05,500 --> 03:15:07,500
Efficiency

1695
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:09,500
Efficiency sometimes leads to

1696
03:15:09,500 --> 03:15:11,500
Missing details

1697
03:15:11,500 --> 03:15:13,500
At least you all caught it

1698
03:15:19,500 --> 03:15:21,500
Thank you for catching it

1699
03:15:21,500 --> 03:15:23,500
I always get ready for stream

1700
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:27,500
Mostly the whole day is

1701
03:15:27,500 --> 03:15:29,500
Um

1702
03:15:32,500 --> 03:15:34,500
Well let's see what my schedule is

1703
03:15:34,500 --> 03:15:36,500
Kind of like my schedule is

1704
03:15:36,500 --> 03:15:38,500
Like planning the day stream

1705
03:15:38,500 --> 03:15:40,500
Mm-hmm

1706
03:15:40,500 --> 03:15:42,500
And then

1707
03:15:45,500 --> 03:15:47,500
And then

1708
03:15:49,500 --> 03:15:51,500
Um catching up on chores

1709
03:15:51,500 --> 03:15:53,500
And things

1710
03:15:53,500 --> 03:15:55,500
Uh

1711
03:15:55,500 --> 03:15:57,500
On Twitter or promotional stuff

1712
03:16:01,500 --> 03:16:03,500
Planning the following weeks

1713
03:16:03,500 --> 03:16:05,500
And

1714
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:07,500
Organize and collapse

1715
03:16:09,500 --> 03:16:10,500
It's a lot

1716
03:16:10,500 --> 03:16:13,500
Oh yeah and then I have to do my audios as well

1717
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:15,500
So

1718
03:16:15,500 --> 03:16:17,500
It might seem like they're small tasks

1719
03:16:17,500 --> 03:16:19,500
But they can take quite a long time

1720
03:16:20,500 --> 03:16:22,500
Canonically

1721
03:16:22,500 --> 03:16:25,500
How many arms, fingers and toes do you have?

1722
03:16:25,500 --> 03:16:27,500
How many times did you cheat?

1723
03:16:27,500 --> 03:16:29,500
Hahaha

1724
03:16:30,500 --> 03:16:32,500
Do senpai scroll them back

1725
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:34,500
For you to cut them again?

1726
03:16:34,500 --> 03:16:36,500
I might ask

1727
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:38,500
Me to like

1728
03:16:38,500 --> 03:16:40,500
Resurrect senpai

1729
03:16:40,500 --> 03:16:42,500
So I can just kill senpai again

1730
03:16:42,500 --> 03:16:44,500
In Minecraft

1731
03:16:44,500 --> 03:16:46,500
Hahaha

1732
03:16:50,500 --> 03:16:52,500
Zero if you hit zero

1733
03:16:52,500 --> 03:16:54,500
Then you have all of your limbs

1734
03:16:56,500 --> 03:16:58,500
But if it's

1735
03:16:58,500 --> 03:17:00,500
Even just one

1736
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:02,500
Some parts might be missing

1737
03:17:05,500 --> 03:17:07,500
Hahaha

1738
03:17:13,500 --> 03:17:15,500
That's all

1739
03:17:19,500 --> 03:17:21,500
So

1740
03:17:21,500 --> 03:17:23,500
What else

1741
03:17:23,500 --> 03:17:25,500
What else

1742
03:17:25,500 --> 03:17:27,500
Oh yeah and then I

1743
03:17:27,500 --> 03:17:29,500
Do a lot of chores and stuff

1744
03:17:29,500 --> 03:17:31,500
Yeah

1745
03:17:31,500 --> 03:17:33,500
I have to make sure everything's kind of in order as well

1746
03:17:33,500 --> 03:17:35,500
A lot of things are taken care of

1747
03:17:35,500 --> 03:17:37,500
By manager and

1748
03:17:37,500 --> 03:17:39,500
The team

1749
03:17:39,500 --> 03:17:41,500
But you know there's still some stuff that I have to

1750
03:17:41,500 --> 03:17:43,500
Do

1751
03:17:43,500 --> 03:17:45,500
I definitely feel very blessed

1752
03:17:45,500 --> 03:17:47,500
To be in VLR

1753
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:49,500
Because a lot of it is definitely

1754
03:17:49,500 --> 03:17:51,500
A

1755
03:17:51,500 --> 03:17:53,500
Just go and make

1756
03:17:53,500 --> 03:17:55,500
And create and do

1757
03:17:55,500 --> 03:17:57,500
And

1758
03:17:57,500 --> 03:17:59,500
And stream

1759
03:18:07,500 --> 03:18:09,500
It's not a bit too lenient to take

1760
03:18:09,500 --> 03:18:11,500
A limb for cheating

1761
03:18:13,500 --> 03:18:15,500
I'm so nice don't you think senpai?

1762
03:18:17,500 --> 03:18:19,500
I'm so nice that I give you so many chances

1763
03:18:27,500 --> 03:18:29,500
Just got to get stuff out there since the very beginning

1764
03:18:29,500 --> 03:18:31,500
Mmm

1765
03:18:31,500 --> 03:18:33,500
It's a lot of

1766
03:18:33,500 --> 03:18:35,500
Planning

1767
03:18:35,500 --> 03:18:37,500
So my weeks are

1768
03:18:39,500 --> 03:18:41,500
A month in advance

1769
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:43,500
At least a month in advance

1770
03:18:43,500 --> 03:18:45,500
For my schedules

1771
03:18:47,500 --> 03:18:49,500
So

1772
03:18:53,500 --> 03:18:55,500
So

1773
03:18:55,500 --> 03:18:57,500
Um

1774
03:18:57,500 --> 03:18:59,500
Definitely because it's debut week

1775
03:18:59,500 --> 03:19:01,500
Things are

1776
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:03,500
Things are

1777
03:19:03,500 --> 03:19:05,500
Um

1778
03:19:05,500 --> 03:19:07,500
Excuse me

1779
03:19:09,500 --> 03:19:11,500
Things are

1780
03:19:11,500 --> 03:19:13,500
Going

1781
03:19:13,500 --> 03:19:15,500
Are

1782
03:19:15,500 --> 03:19:17,500
On kind of accelerate

1783
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:19,500
Accelerate

1784
03:19:19,500 --> 03:19:21,500
So it's a bit hectic

1785
03:19:21,500 --> 03:19:23,500
To just establish ourselves

1786
03:19:27,500 --> 03:19:29,500
It's just to establish ourselves

1787
03:19:29,500 --> 03:19:31,500
And

1788
03:19:31,500 --> 03:19:33,500
To kind of

1789
03:19:33,500 --> 03:19:35,500
Give

1790
03:19:35,500 --> 03:19:37,500
Senpai's and the fans

1791
03:19:37,500 --> 03:19:39,500
Like

1792
03:19:39,500 --> 03:19:41,500
A bit of taste of what

1793
03:19:41,500 --> 03:19:43,500
Our contents like

1794
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:45,500
If something you're interested in

1795
03:19:47,500 --> 03:19:49,500
And then maybe

1796
03:19:49,500 --> 03:19:51,500
After the first month

1797
03:19:51,500 --> 03:19:53,500
I think after the first month

1798
03:19:53,500 --> 03:19:55,500
Well

1799
03:19:55,500 --> 03:19:57,500
I think

1800
03:19:57,500 --> 03:19:59,500
After the first month

1801
03:19:59,500 --> 03:20:01,500
I might be granted it sooner

1802
03:20:01,500 --> 03:20:03,500
I'm not sure

1803
03:20:03,500 --> 03:20:05,500
But alternative

1804
03:20:05,500 --> 03:20:07,500
Websites and stuff for streaming

1805
03:20:07,500 --> 03:20:09,500
Might be in the works

1806
03:20:13,500 --> 03:20:15,500
Because

1807
03:20:15,500 --> 03:20:17,500
Um

1808
03:20:17,500 --> 03:20:19,500
Yeah, so giving ourselves a month

1809
03:20:19,500 --> 03:20:21,500
To get used to

1810
03:20:21,500 --> 03:20:23,500
Our new

1811
03:20:23,500 --> 03:20:25,500
Our new schedule

1812
03:20:25,500 --> 03:20:27,500
Our new routine

1813
03:20:27,500 --> 03:20:29,500
And kind of establish ourselves

1814
03:20:29,500 --> 03:20:31,500
On

1815
03:20:31,500 --> 03:20:33,500
The

1816
03:20:33,500 --> 03:20:35,500
On the main

1817
03:20:35,500 --> 03:20:37,500
Platforms first

1818
03:20:37,500 --> 03:20:39,500
Hmm

1819
03:20:39,500 --> 03:20:41,500
Hmm

1820
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:43,500
So that's

1821
03:20:43,500 --> 03:20:45,500
Why

1822
03:20:45,500 --> 03:20:47,500
Things are kind of

1823
03:20:47,500 --> 03:20:49,500
A lot so far

1824
03:20:49,500 --> 03:20:51,500
I seem exhausted

1825
03:20:51,500 --> 03:20:53,500
It is definitely a lot

1826
03:20:53,500 --> 03:20:55,500
I will be slowing down

1827
03:20:55,500 --> 03:20:57,500
My schedule turns out I'm not slowing down that much

1828
03:20:57,500 --> 03:20:59,500
Apparently

1829
03:20:59,500 --> 03:21:01,500
I booked myself for like

1830
03:21:01,500 --> 03:21:03,500
Five streams

1831
03:21:03,500 --> 03:21:05,500
Next week

1832
03:21:05,500 --> 03:21:07,500
Four

1833
03:21:07,500 --> 03:21:09,500
When I said

1834
03:21:09,500 --> 03:21:11,500
I'm going to lower it down to three streams a week

1835
03:21:11,500 --> 03:21:13,500
That was a freaking lie

1836
03:21:13,500 --> 03:21:15,500
Blame myself

1837
03:21:17,500 --> 03:21:19,500
That was a freaking lie

1838
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:21,500
I had to double check my schedule

1839
03:21:21,500 --> 03:21:23,500
So I might do it

1840
03:21:23,500 --> 03:21:25,500
Later

1841
03:21:27,500 --> 03:21:29,500
Maybe it's slowly

1842
03:21:29,500 --> 03:21:31,500
Slowly

1843
03:21:31,500 --> 03:21:33,500
When will my next ASMR

1844
03:21:33,500 --> 03:21:35,500
Spring be

1845
03:21:37,500 --> 03:21:39,500
Maybe next month

1846
03:21:39,500 --> 03:21:41,500
I have to see

1847
03:21:41,500 --> 03:21:43,500
I have to see because I'm like booked up

1848
03:21:43,500 --> 03:21:45,500
I might be able to fit something in

1849
03:21:45,500 --> 03:21:47,500
Um

1850
03:21:47,500 --> 03:21:49,500
But I'm definitely having to fix some audio stuff

1851
03:21:49,500 --> 03:21:51,500
Because I know that my audio is

1852
03:21:51,500 --> 03:21:53,500
Really quiet and I have to fix that

1853
03:21:53,500 --> 03:21:55,500
Darn

1854
03:21:55,500 --> 03:21:57,500
Darn ending screen where I blew out

1855
03:21:57,500 --> 03:21:59,500
Senpai's

1856
03:21:59,500 --> 03:22:01,500
Ears out that was my bad

1857
03:22:01,500 --> 03:22:03,500
Ha ha

1858
03:22:03,500 --> 03:22:05,500
If you need a break

1859
03:22:05,500 --> 03:22:07,500
We understand

1860
03:22:07,500 --> 03:22:09,500
I probably need at least a break

1861
03:22:09,500 --> 03:22:11,500
Next week. This week I'm still good

1862
03:22:11,500 --> 03:22:13,500
I'm still ready

1863
03:22:15,500 --> 03:22:17,500
I got some maros

1864
03:22:17,500 --> 03:22:19,500
And some comments though

1865
03:22:19,500 --> 03:22:21,500
That said

1866
03:22:21,500 --> 03:22:23,500
Actually that

1867
03:22:23,500 --> 03:22:25,500
They were so relaxed for the ASMR

1868
03:22:25,500 --> 03:22:27,500
That

1869
03:22:27,500 --> 03:22:29,500
They didn't even wake up from

1870
03:22:29,500 --> 03:22:31,500
The loud jump scare

1871
03:22:31,500 --> 03:22:33,500
So I was really impressed

1872
03:22:33,500 --> 03:22:35,500
I was like oh okay

1873
03:22:35,500 --> 03:22:37,500
I guess I did a good job

1874
03:22:37,500 --> 03:22:39,500
It was my first time

1875
03:22:39,500 --> 03:22:41,500
I actually

1876
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:43,500
Went to IC

1877
03:22:43,500 --> 03:22:45,500
IC is actually very

1878
03:22:45,500 --> 03:22:47,500
Very familiar with ASMR

1879
03:22:47,500 --> 03:22:49,500
So

1880
03:22:49,500 --> 03:22:51,500
IC's ASMR are

1881
03:22:51,500 --> 03:22:53,500
Definitely something to look forward to

1882
03:22:55,500 --> 03:22:57,500
I see so

1883
03:22:57,500 --> 03:22:59,500
So

1884
03:22:59,500 --> 03:23:01,500
So is a

1885
03:23:01,500 --> 03:23:03,500
Seasoned ASMRist

1886
03:23:11,500 --> 03:23:13,500
So

1887
03:23:13,500 --> 03:23:15,500
So I definitely look forward

1888
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:17,500
To IC's

1889
03:23:17,500 --> 03:23:19,500
Stuff I had to go

1890
03:23:19,500 --> 03:23:21,500
To IC kind of

1891
03:23:21,500 --> 03:23:23,500
Like last night

1892
03:23:23,500 --> 03:23:25,500
And was like

1893
03:23:25,500 --> 03:23:27,500
What's cupping

1894
03:23:31,500 --> 03:23:33,500
What's cupping

1895
03:23:33,500 --> 03:23:35,500
And then she explained it to me quite well

1896
03:23:35,500 --> 03:23:37,500
And she gave me like a very good video

1897
03:23:37,500 --> 03:23:39,500
On like a cupping

1898
03:23:39,500 --> 03:23:41,500
Example

1899
03:23:41,500 --> 03:23:43,500
Because the ones that I was seeing

1900
03:23:43,500 --> 03:23:45,500
I felt like we're

1901
03:23:45,500 --> 03:23:47,500
We're not quite

1902
03:23:47,500 --> 03:23:49,500
Right?

1903
03:23:49,500 --> 03:23:51,500
I guess

1904
03:23:55,500 --> 03:23:57,500
So

1905
03:24:01,500 --> 03:24:03,500
Sorry if I woke you up

1906
03:24:07,500 --> 03:24:09,500
So

1907
03:24:09,500 --> 03:24:11,500
I was trying to

1908
03:24:11,500 --> 03:24:13,500
Research a little bit

1909
03:24:13,500 --> 03:24:15,500
Because there were some triggers

1910
03:24:15,500 --> 03:24:17,500
I wasn't familiar with

1911
03:24:17,500 --> 03:24:19,500
From SMPI

1912
03:24:19,500 --> 03:24:21,500
SMPI's requested

1913
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:23,500
So I went and I was like what does this mean

1914
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:25,500
Like I'm not doing it right

1915
03:24:25,500 --> 03:24:27,500
So yeah

1916
03:24:27,500 --> 03:24:29,500
I feel like there's some SMPI's

1917
03:24:29,500 --> 03:24:31,500
That definitely didn't like the cupping

1918
03:24:31,500 --> 03:24:33,500
I tried my best based off of the instructions

1919
03:24:33,500 --> 03:24:35,500
From SMPI's and chat

1920
03:24:35,500 --> 03:24:37,500
But I know that some people didn't like it

1921
03:24:37,500 --> 03:24:39,500
So I guess

1922
03:24:39,500 --> 03:24:41,500
I'll give a warning if I do do it

1923
03:24:41,500 --> 03:24:43,500
Because I know some people liked it

1924
03:24:43,500 --> 03:24:45,500
But I know there's a good handful of people that didn't either

1925
03:24:53,500 --> 03:24:55,500
So

1926
03:24:59,500 --> 03:25:01,500
I don't know if I had

1927
03:25:01,500 --> 03:25:03,500
Any like unique triggers

1928
03:25:03,500 --> 03:25:05,500
I didn't go to the store

1929
03:25:05,500 --> 03:25:07,500
And I bought like

1930
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:09,500
Like the globes

1931
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:11,500
Because

1932
03:25:11,500 --> 03:25:13,500
Strani said yes use the globes

1933
03:25:13,500 --> 03:25:15,500
The globes are like wonderful people love it

1934
03:25:15,500 --> 03:25:17,500
I

1935
03:25:21,500 --> 03:25:23,500
And I saw near the

1936
03:25:23,500 --> 03:25:25,500
Near the ice globes

1937
03:25:25,500 --> 03:25:27,500
I remember seeing like this cool gel mask

1938
03:25:27,500 --> 03:25:29,500
And I was like oh

1939
03:25:29,500 --> 03:25:31,500
Oh gee

1940
03:25:31,500 --> 03:25:33,500
I wonder if that's there but it wasn't at this

1941
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:35,500
At this particular store

1942
03:25:35,500 --> 03:25:37,500
That I went to

1943
03:25:37,500 --> 03:25:39,500
So I went to a

1944
03:25:39,500 --> 03:25:41,500
Further store away

1945
03:25:41,500 --> 03:25:43,500
Of SMPI's

1946
03:25:43,500 --> 03:25:45,500
And thankfully I drove

1947
03:25:45,500 --> 03:25:47,500
I drove about 30 minutes

1948
03:25:47,500 --> 03:25:49,500
To go to another store

1949
03:25:49,500 --> 03:25:51,500
To see if they had

1950
03:25:51,500 --> 03:25:53,500
This gel mask I saw in stock

1951
03:25:55,500 --> 03:25:57,500
Because I remember touching it

1952
03:25:57,500 --> 03:25:59,500
As a sample before and I really liked it

1953
03:25:59,500 --> 03:26:01,500
Because it has like a bunch of little tiny gel balls

1954
03:26:01,500 --> 03:26:03,500
And it feels good

1955
03:26:03,500 --> 03:26:05,500
And I think it's

1956
03:26:05,500 --> 03:26:07,500
It sounds kind of nice

1957
03:26:13,500 --> 03:26:15,500
So I have them right here next to me

1958
03:26:15,500 --> 03:26:17,500
And so I brought

1959
03:26:17,500 --> 03:26:19,500
Lots of stuff too

1960
03:26:25,500 --> 03:26:27,500
I'm a bit of a giggler

1961
03:26:27,500 --> 03:26:29,500
Honestly if I'm trying to suppress my giggles

1962
03:26:31,500 --> 03:26:33,500
It just gets worse you know

1963
03:26:33,500 --> 03:26:35,500
I was trying to suppress

1964
03:26:35,500 --> 03:26:37,500
Uh

1965
03:26:37,500 --> 03:26:39,500
Suppress

1966
03:26:39,500 --> 03:26:41,500
Um

1967
03:26:43,500 --> 03:26:45,500
I was like

1968
03:26:45,500 --> 03:26:47,500
I just kept going

1969
03:26:47,500 --> 03:26:49,500
It was a cycle

1970
03:26:49,500 --> 03:26:51,500
It was a cycle because

1971
03:26:51,500 --> 03:26:53,500
You know when you try not to laugh

1972
03:26:53,500 --> 03:26:55,500
You laugh harder right

1973
03:27:03,500 --> 03:27:05,500
It was definitely one of those things

1974
03:27:05,500 --> 03:27:07,500
Where I was like oh

1975
03:27:07,500 --> 03:27:09,500
I can't stop

1976
03:27:09,500 --> 03:27:11,500
Because I'm trying to

1977
03:27:11,500 --> 03:27:13,500
To make it really quiet

1978
03:27:13,500 --> 03:27:15,500
And like soft

1979
03:27:15,500 --> 03:27:17,500
But because I'm stifling it

1980
03:27:17,500 --> 03:27:19,500
It's

1981
03:27:19,500 --> 03:27:21,500
Becoming stronger

1982
03:27:21,500 --> 03:27:23,500
And then

1983
03:27:23,500 --> 03:27:25,500
Senpai started laughing

1984
03:27:25,500 --> 03:27:27,500
And I couldn't help but laugh

1985
03:27:33,500 --> 03:27:35,500
Because I got so confused

1986
03:27:35,500 --> 03:27:37,500
I got confused about

1987
03:27:37,500 --> 03:27:39,500
What was it? Nibbling

1988
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:41,500
I don't remember what it was

1989
03:27:41,500 --> 03:27:43,500
And I

1990
03:27:43,500 --> 03:27:45,500
I just went

1991
03:27:47,500 --> 03:27:49,500
Like a feral animal

1992
03:27:59,500 --> 03:28:01,500
It was biting sounds

1993
03:28:01,500 --> 03:28:03,500
I didn't know what it was doing

1994
03:28:09,500 --> 03:28:11,500
I didn't know what I was doing

1995
03:28:11,500 --> 03:28:13,500
So I was like oh

1996
03:28:13,500 --> 03:28:15,500
Gnoming sounds

1997
03:28:15,500 --> 03:28:17,500
What did gnoming sounds sound like?

1998
03:28:17,500 --> 03:28:19,500
Not that

1999
03:28:21,500 --> 03:28:23,500
Not that

2000
03:28:23,500 --> 03:28:25,500
Clearly

2001
03:28:29,500 --> 03:28:31,500
That's just

2002
03:28:31,500 --> 03:28:33,500
Yeah that was my mistake

2003
03:28:33,500 --> 03:28:35,500
Definitely something to think about it

2004
03:28:35,500 --> 03:28:37,500
Hahaha

2005
03:28:37,500 --> 03:28:39,500
I'm learning so

2006
03:28:39,500 --> 03:28:41,500
I'm learning so much because

2007
03:28:41,500 --> 03:28:43,500
Of

2008
03:28:43,500 --> 03:28:45,500
What I did was

2009
03:28:45,500 --> 03:28:47,500
I was listening to some J.P

2010
03:28:47,500 --> 03:28:49,500
J.P

2011
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:51,500
ASMR VTubers

2012
03:28:51,500 --> 03:28:53,500
To see what they did

2013
03:28:53,500 --> 03:28:55,500
And

2014
03:28:57,500 --> 03:28:59,500
I was just really confused

2015
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:01,500
The entire time

2016
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:03,500
And so

2017
03:29:03,500 --> 03:29:05,500
When I was setting up my mic

2018
03:29:05,500 --> 03:29:07,500
I was like the girls were

2019
03:29:07,500 --> 03:29:09,500
Really quiet

2020
03:29:09,500 --> 03:29:11,500
I set up to be

2021
03:29:11,500 --> 03:29:13,500
Quiet

2022
03:29:13,500 --> 03:29:15,500
And then

2023
03:29:15,500 --> 03:29:17,500
I read

2024
03:29:17,500 --> 03:29:19,500
Like

2025
03:29:21,500 --> 03:29:23,500
And then I read

2026
03:29:23,500 --> 03:29:25,500
When you're whispering

2027
03:29:25,500 --> 03:29:27,500
You should do like a reel

2028
03:29:29,500 --> 03:29:31,500
And so I was like

2029
03:29:31,500 --> 03:29:33,500
Okay okay

2030
03:29:33,500 --> 03:29:35,500
I'll do a reel whisper

2031
03:29:35,500 --> 03:29:37,500
And instead I ended up doing a stage whisper

2032
03:29:39,500 --> 03:29:41,500
Because I was too quiet

2033
03:29:41,500 --> 03:29:43,500
I'll have to fix that up

2034
03:29:43,500 --> 03:29:45,500
I didn't want to

2035
03:29:47,500 --> 03:29:49,500
I didn't want to accidentally break

2036
03:29:49,500 --> 03:29:51,500
Senpai's ears

2037
03:29:51,500 --> 03:29:53,500
Especially if there were

2038
03:29:53,500 --> 03:29:55,500
Those who were

2039
03:29:55,500 --> 03:29:57,500
Who were already settled in

2040
03:29:57,500 --> 03:29:59,500
And like relaxing and about to sleep

2041
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:01,500
To break any

2042
03:30:05,500 --> 03:30:07,500
Any

2043
03:30:11,500 --> 03:30:13,500
Any ears from me

2044
03:30:13,500 --> 03:30:15,500
Messing around with the audio

2045
03:30:21,500 --> 03:30:23,500
Who was I watching

2046
03:30:23,500 --> 03:30:25,500
I wasn't

2047
03:30:25,500 --> 03:30:27,500
I'm aware of

2048
03:30:27,500 --> 03:30:29,500
I'm aware of them

2049
03:30:29,500 --> 03:30:31,500
Since I

2050
03:30:31,500 --> 03:30:33,500
Had some maro suggesting

2051
03:30:33,500 --> 03:30:35,500
To check them out

2052
03:30:35,500 --> 03:30:37,500
So I'm aware of them

2053
03:30:37,500 --> 03:30:39,500
Who did I watch

2054
03:30:47,500 --> 03:30:49,500
I was watching

2055
03:30:49,500 --> 03:30:51,500
Petra

2056
03:30:51,500 --> 03:30:53,500
Cool

2057
03:30:53,500 --> 03:30:55,500
Petra

2058
03:30:55,500 --> 03:30:57,500
I was watching Petra's

2059
03:30:57,500 --> 03:30:59,500
ASMRs

2060
03:31:03,500 --> 03:31:05,500
And I thought

2061
03:31:05,500 --> 03:31:07,500
Petra's audios

2062
03:31:07,500 --> 03:31:09,500
Were kind of

2063
03:31:09,500 --> 03:31:11,500
Kind of more quiet

2064
03:31:11,500 --> 03:31:13,500
So I decided to go with more quiet

2065
03:31:13,500 --> 03:31:15,500
And I matched and I did some tests before stream

2066
03:31:15,500 --> 03:31:17,500
So I matched

2067
03:31:17,500 --> 03:31:19,500
The audio and how it jumped

2068
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:21,500
In OBS

2069
03:31:21,500 --> 03:31:23,500
Her audios

2070
03:31:23,500 --> 03:31:25,500
The regular volume

2071
03:31:25,500 --> 03:31:27,500
With my audios and they matched

2072
03:31:27,500 --> 03:31:29,500
And I was like okay, we're good

2073
03:31:29,500 --> 03:31:31,500
And turned out they don't match on stream

2074
03:31:31,500 --> 03:31:33,500
So that sucked

2075
03:31:35,500 --> 03:31:37,500
So I

2076
03:31:37,500 --> 03:31:39,500
Kind of copied Petra

2077
03:31:39,500 --> 03:31:41,500
Sorry

2078
03:31:43,500 --> 03:31:45,500
I suck

2079
03:31:45,500 --> 03:31:47,500
Yeah, I'm sorry

2080
03:31:47,500 --> 03:31:49,500
I copied Petra a little bit

2081
03:31:49,500 --> 03:31:51,500
Because I was like okay, well Petra did this stuff

2082
03:31:51,500 --> 03:31:53,500
And I looked at some other

2083
03:31:53,500 --> 03:31:55,500
ASMR tubers

2084
03:31:55,500 --> 03:31:57,500
Who I don't remember, but I definitely referenced

2085
03:31:57,500 --> 03:31:59,500
A lot of Petra's stuff

2086
03:32:05,500 --> 03:32:07,500
Inspired, yeah

2087
03:32:07,500 --> 03:32:09,500
How dare you, yeah

2088
03:32:09,500 --> 03:32:11,500
When I say stole

2089
03:32:11,500 --> 03:32:13,500
It's more like matching audio

2090
03:32:13,500 --> 03:32:15,500
Matching types of audio

2091
03:32:17,500 --> 03:32:19,500
And seeing

2092
03:32:19,500 --> 03:32:21,500
The audio levels were

2093
03:32:21,500 --> 03:32:23,500
I don't really mean that I'm stealing

2094
03:32:23,500 --> 03:32:25,500
Her ideas or

2095
03:32:25,500 --> 03:32:27,500
Her triggers

2096
03:32:27,500 --> 03:32:29,500
It's more like

2097
03:32:29,500 --> 03:32:31,500
Seeing

2098
03:32:31,500 --> 03:32:33,500
What the volume was like

2099
03:32:33,500 --> 03:32:35,500
And what the pacing was

2100
03:32:39,500 --> 03:32:41,500
And

2101
03:32:41,500 --> 03:32:43,500
How she would go between ears

2102
03:32:43,500 --> 03:32:45,500
And stuff

2103
03:32:45,500 --> 03:32:47,500
Things like that

2104
03:32:47,500 --> 03:32:49,500
Yeah, like watching

2105
03:32:49,500 --> 03:32:51,500
The gain and matching the volume

2106
03:32:51,500 --> 03:32:53,500
Yeah, so that's what I did

2107
03:32:53,500 --> 03:32:55,500
But turns out it was too quiet on stream

2108
03:32:55,500 --> 03:32:57,500
So I was like oh shit

2109
03:32:57,500 --> 03:32:59,500
Oh shit

2110
03:32:59,500 --> 03:33:01,500
And I didn't want to adjust it

2111
03:33:01,500 --> 03:33:03,500
In case I adjusted

2112
03:33:03,500 --> 03:33:05,500
I overcompensated

2113
03:33:05,500 --> 03:33:07,500
So I was really worried

2114
03:33:07,500 --> 03:33:09,500
About overcompensating

2115
03:33:15,500 --> 03:33:17,500
But yeah

2116
03:33:17,500 --> 03:33:19,500
What I ended up doing

2117
03:33:19,500 --> 03:33:21,500
Was kind of picking my own things

2118
03:33:21,500 --> 03:33:23,500
That I sort of liked

2119
03:33:23,500 --> 03:33:25,500
So I basically went to the store

2120
03:33:25,500 --> 03:33:27,500
Touched every single like

2121
03:33:27,500 --> 03:33:29,500
Products in there and I just picked the ones

2122
03:33:29,500 --> 03:33:31,500
That I liked the most or like I remembered

2123
03:33:31,500 --> 03:33:33,500
That it was in the store

2124
03:33:33,500 --> 03:33:35,500
And if it wasn't in that store

2125
03:33:35,500 --> 03:33:37,500
I just drove

2126
03:33:37,500 --> 03:33:39,500
Basically 30 minutes away to

2127
03:33:39,500 --> 03:33:41,500
To

2128
03:33:41,500 --> 03:33:43,500
To another store

2129
03:33:43,500 --> 03:33:45,500
And then

2130
03:33:45,500 --> 03:33:47,500
And then

2131
03:33:47,500 --> 03:33:49,500
Drove 30 minutes back

2132
03:33:49,500 --> 03:33:51,500
Just to get like

2133
03:33:51,500 --> 03:33:53,500
Do you have a few products?

2134
03:33:53,500 --> 03:33:55,500
Because I was like oh well

2135
03:33:55,500 --> 03:33:57,500
I liked these sounds

2136
03:33:57,500 --> 03:33:59,500
Or I liked these sounds personally

2137
03:33:59,500 --> 03:34:01,500
So that's what I was using

2138
03:34:01,500 --> 03:34:03,500
And then I ended up

2139
03:34:03,500 --> 03:34:05,500
Doing a lot of

2140
03:34:05,500 --> 03:34:07,500
Sempai suggestions

2141
03:34:07,500 --> 03:34:09,500
And requests because I was just like

2142
03:34:09,500 --> 03:34:11,500
Oh I don't know it

2143
03:34:11,500 --> 03:34:13,500
Does the store sell slime?

2144
03:34:13,500 --> 03:34:15,500
I was thinking about slime

2145
03:34:15,500 --> 03:34:17,500
But I was

2146
03:34:17,500 --> 03:34:19,500
Hmm

2147
03:34:19,500 --> 03:34:21,500
I was a little worried

2148
03:34:21,500 --> 03:34:23,500
Because I wanted something

2149
03:34:23,500 --> 03:34:25,500
To be

2150
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:27,500
Um

2151
03:34:27,500 --> 03:34:29,500
I wasn't sure

2152
03:34:29,500 --> 03:34:31,500
If slime

2153
03:34:31,500 --> 03:34:33,500
Was a reusable

2154
03:34:33,500 --> 03:34:35,500
Product

2155
03:34:35,500 --> 03:34:37,500
Does that make sense?

2156
03:34:37,500 --> 03:34:39,500
I didn't know if it was a reusable product

2157
03:34:39,500 --> 03:34:41,500
Because

2158
03:34:41,500 --> 03:34:43,500
And then I also

2159
03:34:43,500 --> 03:34:45,500
Thought about

2160
03:34:45,500 --> 03:34:47,500
The whole YouTube thing

2161
03:34:47,500 --> 03:34:49,500
The whole YouTube things taking down channels

2162
03:34:49,500 --> 03:34:51,500
Usually is

2163
03:34:51,500 --> 03:34:53,500
Yeah I don't know though

2164
03:34:53,500 --> 03:34:55,500
Because it's like in a container and I was worried

2165
03:34:55,500 --> 03:34:57,500
Like oh what if like slime dries out and stuff

2166
03:34:57,500 --> 03:34:59,500
I've never really

2167
03:34:59,500 --> 03:35:01,500
Played with slime before

2168
03:35:01,500 --> 03:35:03,500
Does that make sense? Yeah I've never

2169
03:35:03,500 --> 03:35:05,500
Played with slime

2170
03:35:05,500 --> 03:35:07,500
I've never had an interest in slime

2171
03:35:07,500 --> 03:35:09,500
I know my friends were like

2172
03:35:09,500 --> 03:35:11,500
Oh my gosh I love slime

2173
03:35:11,500 --> 03:35:13,500
Here's like a new one that's chocolate scented

2174
03:35:13,500 --> 03:35:15,500
Or something and I'm like

2175
03:35:15,500 --> 03:35:17,500
I don't get it

2176
03:35:25,500 --> 03:35:27,500
But yeah I was like

2177
03:35:27,500 --> 03:35:29,500
Oh maybe slime

2178
03:35:29,500 --> 03:35:31,500
Making the squishing sound might be good

2179
03:35:31,500 --> 03:35:33,500
But the gel

2180
03:35:33,500 --> 03:35:35,500
The gel here

2181
03:35:35,500 --> 03:35:37,500
The squishing sound for the gel

2182
03:35:37,500 --> 03:35:39,500
Is

2183
03:35:39,500 --> 03:35:41,500
Stuck between like its little

2184
03:35:41,500 --> 03:35:43,500
Fabrics

2185
03:35:43,500 --> 03:35:45,500
So I thought that made it

2186
03:35:45,500 --> 03:35:47,500
Made it more

2187
03:35:55,500 --> 03:35:57,500
Safe?

2188
03:35:57,500 --> 03:35:59,500
Sorry

2189
03:36:01,500 --> 03:36:03,500
I was gonna say have you thought of oil massage?

2190
03:36:03,500 --> 03:36:05,500
I thought about it

2191
03:36:05,500 --> 03:36:07,500
But then I was worried that I would

2192
03:36:07,500 --> 03:36:09,500
I would ruin the 3DL

2193
03:36:15,500 --> 03:36:17,500
Cause I was like

2194
03:36:17,500 --> 03:36:19,500
I don't put it directly on right?

2195
03:36:19,500 --> 03:36:21,500
Um

2196
03:36:29,500 --> 03:36:31,500
I don't think I put it directly on

2197
03:36:31,500 --> 03:36:33,500
So I haven't really figured that out yet

2198
03:36:33,500 --> 03:36:35,500
I also didn't want to make a mess

2199
03:36:35,500 --> 03:36:37,500
Because

2200
03:36:37,500 --> 03:36:39,500
There's like a lot of

2201
03:36:39,500 --> 03:36:41,500
I have a lot of stuff here

2202
03:36:41,500 --> 03:36:43,500
That I don't want to get dirty

2203
03:36:45,500 --> 03:36:47,500
Um I didn't I ended up not going

2204
03:36:47,500 --> 03:36:49,500
With earpicks I do have a Japanese earpick

2205
03:36:49,500 --> 03:36:51,500
Uh

2206
03:36:51,500 --> 03:36:53,500
Because everyone does it

2207
03:36:55,500 --> 03:36:57,500
So I wanted to

2208
03:36:57,500 --> 03:36:59,500
Sort of differentiate

2209
03:36:59,500 --> 03:37:01,500
My first ASMR3

2210
03:37:01,500 --> 03:37:03,500
Just a bit

2211
03:37:03,500 --> 03:37:05,500
Not too much

2212
03:37:05,500 --> 03:37:07,500
Just a bit

2213
03:37:13,500 --> 03:37:15,500
So I

2214
03:37:15,500 --> 03:37:17,500
I don't want

2215
03:37:17,500 --> 03:37:19,500
I didn't want to just

2216
03:37:19,500 --> 03:37:21,500
Do it

2217
03:37:21,500 --> 03:37:23,500
To do something

2218
03:37:23,500 --> 03:37:25,500
Very common I suppose

2219
03:37:25,500 --> 03:37:27,500
Because

2220
03:37:27,500 --> 03:37:29,500
In my opinion when some people do

2221
03:37:29,500 --> 03:37:31,500
Earpicks I did not like them

2222
03:37:31,500 --> 03:37:33,500
I remember watching some videos going

2223
03:37:33,500 --> 03:37:35,500
I

2224
03:37:35,500 --> 03:37:37,500
No I don't like them

2225
03:37:37,500 --> 03:37:39,500
So because I didn't like it myself

2226
03:37:41,500 --> 03:37:43,500
Like I like using earpicks on myself

2227
03:37:43,500 --> 03:37:45,500
I'm like oh this is relaxing but if like

2228
03:37:45,500 --> 03:37:47,500
An audio was doing it

2229
03:37:47,500 --> 03:37:49,500
I'm like

2230
03:37:49,500 --> 03:37:51,500
Maybe not me

2231
03:37:53,500 --> 03:37:55,500
Maybe not that

2232
03:37:55,500 --> 03:37:57,500
And I was like oh everyone kind of

2233
03:37:57,500 --> 03:37:59,500
Does earpicks

2234
03:37:59,500 --> 03:38:01,500
So

2235
03:38:03,500 --> 03:38:05,500
So

2236
03:38:05,500 --> 03:38:07,500
I kind of wanted to differentiate myself

2237
03:38:07,500 --> 03:38:09,500
I even got the globes

2238
03:38:09,500 --> 03:38:11,500
The globes

2239
03:38:11,500 --> 03:38:13,500
Uh

2240
03:38:13,500 --> 03:38:15,500
Was in a different shape

2241
03:38:15,500 --> 03:38:17,500
So I was hoping it would make like a different

2242
03:38:17,500 --> 03:38:19,500
Different sound compared to what's

2243
03:38:19,500 --> 03:38:21,500
Rather than globes

2244
03:38:21,500 --> 03:38:23,500
So the globes I

2245
03:38:23,500 --> 03:38:25,500
Have right now

2246
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:27,500
The globes I have right now are

2247
03:38:27,500 --> 03:38:29,500
Um

2248
03:38:29,500 --> 03:38:31,500
Are the bopple

2249
03:38:31,500 --> 03:38:33,500
End so you know normally it'll be around

2250
03:38:33,500 --> 03:38:35,500
Circle

2251
03:38:35,500 --> 03:38:37,500
It was shaped of a moon

2252
03:38:37,500 --> 03:38:39,500
It was a shape of a moon

2253
03:38:39,500 --> 03:38:41,500
So I thought it would make a unique

2254
03:38:41,500 --> 03:38:43,500
Sound

2255
03:38:43,500 --> 03:38:45,500
Can I feel like the

2256
03:38:45,500 --> 03:38:47,500
The bubbling sound

2257
03:38:47,500 --> 03:38:49,500
Uh

2258
03:38:49,500 --> 03:38:51,500
Made

2259
03:38:51,500 --> 03:38:53,500
Made

2260
03:38:53,500 --> 03:38:55,500
What lasted a bit longer

2261
03:38:55,500 --> 03:38:57,500
In these ones

2262
03:38:57,500 --> 03:38:59,500
Have you posed with them yet

2263
03:38:59,500 --> 03:39:01,500
That was the first thing I did

2264
03:39:01,500 --> 03:39:03,500
When I got home I was like

2265
03:39:03,500 --> 03:39:05,500
Moon prism power

2266
03:39:05,500 --> 03:39:07,500
Makeup

2267
03:39:09,500 --> 03:39:11,500
The first thing I did

2268
03:39:11,500 --> 03:39:13,500
When I opened them

2269
03:39:31,500 --> 03:39:33,500
That was the first thing I did

2270
03:39:33,500 --> 03:39:35,500
Regular orbs

2271
03:39:35,500 --> 03:39:37,500
Like the regular ice

2272
03:39:37,500 --> 03:39:39,500
Rollers uh on standby

2273
03:39:39,500 --> 03:39:41,500
In case

2274
03:39:41,500 --> 03:39:43,500
I wanted like a little bit of variety

2275
03:39:51,500 --> 03:39:53,500
So I do have some of that

2276
03:39:53,500 --> 03:39:55,500
I

2277
03:39:55,500 --> 03:39:57,500
Think my biggest problem was

2278
03:39:57,500 --> 03:39:59,500
I was worried if I placed

2279
03:39:59,500 --> 03:40:01,500
Down the

2280
03:40:01,500 --> 03:40:03,500
Items it would make a loud

2281
03:40:03,500 --> 03:40:05,500
You know hold on

2282
03:40:05,500 --> 03:40:07,500
Sound

2283
03:40:07,500 --> 03:40:09,500
So I was like

2284
03:40:09,500 --> 03:40:11,500
Oh shoot where did I put it

2285
03:40:13,500 --> 03:40:15,500
I just put it in my lap

2286
03:40:15,500 --> 03:40:17,500
Or well actually

2287
03:40:17,500 --> 03:40:19,500
I'm wearing kind of a hoodie

2288
03:40:19,500 --> 03:40:21,500
Right now because

2289
03:40:25,500 --> 03:40:27,500
I put it in my

2290
03:40:27,500 --> 03:40:29,500
In my hoodie pocket

2291
03:40:31,500 --> 03:40:33,500
Question mercy is it

2292
03:40:33,500 --> 03:40:35,500
Awkward to have viewers who are much older

2293
03:40:35,500 --> 03:40:37,500
Or younger than you are

2294
03:40:37,500 --> 03:40:39,500
Excuse me

2295
03:40:39,500 --> 03:40:41,500
Sorry I didn't take a sip in a while

2296
03:40:47,500 --> 03:40:49,500
Not

2297
03:40:49,500 --> 03:40:51,500
In particular

2298
03:40:51,500 --> 03:40:53,500
Um I do have to

2299
03:40:53,500 --> 03:40:55,500
Say that due to the nature

2300
03:40:55,500 --> 03:40:57,500
Of my company I would

2301
03:40:57,500 --> 03:40:59,500
Prefer

2302
03:40:59,500 --> 03:41:01,500
To be over 18

2303
03:41:03,500 --> 03:41:05,500
And if you are not over 18

2304
03:41:05,500 --> 03:41:07,500
This is not the stream for you

2305
03:41:07,500 --> 03:41:09,500
Or at least this is not the company

2306
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:11,500
For you

2307
03:41:11,500 --> 03:41:13,500
I feel like a different company

2308
03:41:13,500 --> 03:41:15,500
Would

2309
03:41:15,500 --> 03:41:17,500
Suffice more

2310
03:41:23,500 --> 03:41:25,500
I don't

2311
03:41:25,500 --> 03:41:27,500
Have any particular differences

2312
03:41:27,500 --> 03:41:29,500
I don't feel

2313
03:41:29,500 --> 03:41:31,500
Anything in particular

2314
03:41:31,500 --> 03:41:33,500
Simply because

2315
03:41:33,500 --> 03:41:35,500
I don't know I've been an entertainer

2316
03:41:35,500 --> 03:41:37,500
And like

2317
03:41:37,500 --> 03:41:39,500
I've been an entertainer for so long

2318
03:41:39,500 --> 03:41:41,500
That like

2319
03:41:41,500 --> 03:41:43,500
You know if it's an audience of

2320
03:41:43,500 --> 03:41:45,500
All ages it just happens right

2321
03:41:53,500 --> 03:41:55,500
So like

2322
03:41:55,500 --> 03:41:57,500
In plays

2323
03:41:57,500 --> 03:41:59,500
In plays and stuff

2324
03:41:59,500 --> 03:42:01,500
Sometimes

2325
03:42:03,500 --> 03:42:05,500
Kids and people of all ages

2326
03:42:05,500 --> 03:42:07,500
Go to play

2327
03:42:07,500 --> 03:42:09,500
And so sometimes

2328
03:42:09,500 --> 03:42:11,500
You'll see like an old couple

2329
03:42:11,500 --> 03:42:13,500
Will come in and watch a play

2330
03:42:13,500 --> 03:42:15,500
Maybe the play is meant for like

2331
03:42:15,500 --> 03:42:17,500
Older teens

2332
03:42:17,500 --> 03:42:19,500
And you'll see like an old couple

2333
03:42:21,500 --> 03:42:23,500
Old couple come

2334
03:42:23,500 --> 03:42:25,500
And watch the play

2335
03:42:25,500 --> 03:42:27,500
That you're performing

2336
03:42:27,500 --> 03:42:29,500
And I feel like

2337
03:42:29,500 --> 03:42:31,500
As an entertainer age doesn't really matter

2338
03:42:31,500 --> 03:42:33,500
Who your audience is as long as they're entertaining

2339
03:42:35,500 --> 03:42:37,500
So if you are on the older side

2340
03:42:37,500 --> 03:42:39,500
I don't mind

2341
03:42:39,500 --> 03:42:41,500
Mostly because

2342
03:42:41,500 --> 03:42:43,500
I'm used to it

2343
03:42:43,500 --> 03:42:45,500
It's hard to say

2344
03:42:45,500 --> 03:42:47,500
It may sound strange

2345
03:42:47,500 --> 03:42:49,500
Yeah maybe it's not like hard to say

2346
03:42:49,500 --> 03:42:51,500
But it sounds strange

2347
03:42:51,500 --> 03:42:53,500
I'm having a wide range

2348
03:42:53,500 --> 03:42:55,500
Of

2349
03:42:59,500 --> 03:43:01,500
People watching me

2350
03:43:01,500 --> 03:43:03,500
In different formats

2351
03:43:05,500 --> 03:43:07,500
So in different mediums

2352
03:43:07,500 --> 03:43:09,500
So I've had people of all ages

2353
03:43:09,500 --> 03:43:11,500
Watch me

2354
03:43:13,500 --> 03:43:15,500
In movies

2355
03:43:15,500 --> 03:43:17,500
I've had people of all ages

2356
03:43:17,500 --> 03:43:19,500
Watch me in stage plays

2357
03:43:19,500 --> 03:43:21,500
I've had people of all ages

2358
03:43:21,500 --> 03:43:23,500
Watch me in like

2359
03:43:25,500 --> 03:43:27,500
You know like even like

2360
03:43:27,500 --> 03:43:29,500
Radio plays and stuff

2361
03:43:29,500 --> 03:43:31,500
So it's not something

2362
03:43:31,500 --> 03:43:33,500
That I think about

2363
03:43:33,500 --> 03:43:35,500
Too

2364
03:43:35,500 --> 03:43:37,500
Often

2365
03:43:37,500 --> 03:43:39,500
I don't think about age as like a restriction

2366
03:43:39,500 --> 03:43:41,500
Except for you know being in this company

2367
03:43:41,500 --> 03:43:43,500
Please be over 18

2368
03:43:49,500 --> 03:43:51,500
So

2369
03:43:55,500 --> 03:43:57,500
So things like that

2370
03:43:59,500 --> 03:44:01,500
So yeah

2371
03:44:01,500 --> 03:44:03,500
Anyone all ages are welcome

2372
03:44:03,500 --> 03:44:05,500
Except for under 18 you're not welcomed

2373
03:44:07,500 --> 03:44:09,500
Well maybe not

2374
03:44:09,500 --> 03:44:11,500
Not until you hit 18

2375
03:44:11,500 --> 03:44:13,500
Then

2376
03:44:13,500 --> 03:44:15,500
You're not ready for it yet

2377
03:44:15,500 --> 03:44:17,500
I'm trying to say this very nicely

2378
03:44:29,500 --> 03:44:31,500
What if I'm zero

2379
03:44:31,500 --> 03:44:33,500
Well

2380
03:44:33,500 --> 03:44:35,500
You're a very smart baby

2381
03:44:35,500 --> 03:44:37,500
And I think you need to be

2382
03:44:37,500 --> 03:44:39,500
You're too

2383
03:44:39,500 --> 03:44:41,500
You have too much

2384
03:44:41,500 --> 03:44:43,500
Linguist for a zero

2385
03:44:43,500 --> 03:44:45,500
You're old baby

2386
03:44:49,500 --> 03:44:51,500
And I think that

2387
03:44:51,500 --> 03:44:53,500
Maybe you're possessed

2388
03:44:53,500 --> 03:44:55,500
And that I would bring you to a priest

2389
03:44:55,500 --> 03:44:57,500
To be exercised

2390
03:44:57,500 --> 03:44:59,500
Hahaha

2391
03:45:09,500 --> 03:45:11,500
Sounds like an Amy problem

2392
03:45:11,500 --> 03:45:13,500
I know Amy's old

2393
03:45:13,500 --> 03:45:15,500
Old enough

2394
03:45:17,500 --> 03:45:19,500
What if I'm already at wizard's age

2395
03:45:19,500 --> 03:45:21,500
Like what

2396
03:45:21,500 --> 03:45:23,500
Like 30 30

2397
03:45:23,500 --> 03:45:25,500
You become a wizard

2398
03:45:25,500 --> 03:45:27,500
When you're like a virgin till you're 30 right

2399
03:45:31,500 --> 03:45:33,500
Why does that matter

2400
03:45:33,500 --> 03:45:35,500
Of course you're welcomed

2401
03:45:39,500 --> 03:45:41,500
Of course you're welcomed

2402
03:45:45,500 --> 03:45:47,500
Did I just reveal Amy's lollipop

2403
03:45:47,500 --> 03:45:49,500
No

2404
03:45:49,500 --> 03:45:51,500
No no

2405
03:45:51,500 --> 03:45:53,500
Amy's

2406
03:45:53,500 --> 03:45:55,500
Amy's legal

2407
03:45:55,500 --> 03:45:57,500
You know what

2408
03:45:57,500 --> 03:45:59,500
Fuck off, fuck off with that question

2409
03:45:59,500 --> 03:46:01,500
Screw you

2410
03:46:01,500 --> 03:46:03,500
Mods cussed off their testicles

2411
03:46:03,500 --> 03:46:05,500
Mods, odia, obliterate

2412
03:46:05,500 --> 03:46:07,500
Just kidding

2413
03:46:07,500 --> 03:46:09,500
Just get rid of that message

2414
03:46:21,500 --> 03:46:23,500
Hahaha

2415
03:46:29,500 --> 03:46:31,500
I'm just saying that

2416
03:46:31,500 --> 03:46:33,500
Uh yeah

2417
03:46:35,500 --> 03:46:37,500
To legally be a part of the lore

2418
03:46:37,500 --> 03:46:39,500
You must be above the age of 18

2419
03:46:41,500 --> 03:46:43,500
So 18 in human years

2420
03:46:45,500 --> 03:46:47,500
So both Amy and Icy

2421
03:46:47,500 --> 03:46:49,500
Meet that threshold

2422
03:46:51,500 --> 03:46:53,500
Or exceed it

2423
03:46:53,500 --> 03:46:55,500
Or not, I don't know

2424
03:46:55,500 --> 03:46:57,500
I don't actually know

2425
03:46:57,500 --> 03:46:59,500
I don't know how old Icy is

2426
03:46:59,500 --> 03:47:01,500
Really, but you know

2427
03:47:01,500 --> 03:47:03,500
By the power of strongy

2428
03:47:03,500 --> 03:47:05,500
Strongy had magical

2429
03:47:05,500 --> 03:47:07,500
Magical siren powers

2430
03:47:07,500 --> 03:47:09,500
And was able to tell

2431
03:47:09,500 --> 03:47:11,500
Be like yeah yeah yeah

2432
03:47:11,500 --> 03:47:13,500
Okay, you're in

2433
03:47:15,500 --> 03:47:17,500
So they cleared

2434
03:47:17,500 --> 03:47:19,500
They cleared the bar

2435
03:47:19,500 --> 03:47:21,500
Icy is, Icy is a polar bear

2436
03:47:21,500 --> 03:47:23,500
And uh

2437
03:47:23,500 --> 03:47:25,500
I don't know

2438
03:47:25,500 --> 03:47:27,500
And Amy is

2439
03:47:27,500 --> 03:47:29,500
Like

2440
03:47:29,500 --> 03:47:31,500
Basically an immortal, I guess

2441
03:47:41,500 --> 03:47:43,500
So I don't know

2442
03:47:43,500 --> 03:47:45,500
What, Amy's ages

2443
03:47:49,500 --> 03:47:51,500
And

2444
03:47:53,500 --> 03:47:55,500
Basically it's all

2445
03:47:55,500 --> 03:47:57,500
You know, it's all like

2446
03:47:57,500 --> 03:47:59,500
Everyone is at least of age

2447
03:47:59,500 --> 03:48:01,500
Within human years

2448
03:48:01,500 --> 03:48:03,500
And therefore can pay their taxes

2449
03:48:11,500 --> 03:48:13,500
Her age was question mark that day

2450
03:48:13,500 --> 03:48:15,500
If you, yeah, I don't freaking know

2451
03:48:15,500 --> 03:48:17,500
If I don't know

2452
03:48:17,500 --> 03:48:19,500
Just uh, if you're gonna ask ages

2453
03:48:19,500 --> 03:48:21,500
You should ask them, not me

2454
03:48:23,500 --> 03:48:25,500
We literally just talk about cats

2455
03:48:25,500 --> 03:48:27,500
And maybe we talk about our feelings

2456
03:48:27,500 --> 03:48:29,500
And we talk about like

2457
03:48:31,500 --> 03:48:33,500
You know, girly stuff

2458
03:48:39,500 --> 03:48:41,500
Old enough to drink, smile

2459
03:48:41,500 --> 03:48:43,500
Old enough to pay taxes

2460
03:48:43,500 --> 03:48:45,500
Who's dead

2461
03:48:47,500 --> 03:48:49,500
What's that

2462
03:48:49,500 --> 03:48:51,500
I'm about manly stuff

2463
03:48:51,500 --> 03:48:53,500
We leave that to

2464
03:48:53,500 --> 03:48:55,500
To...to you guys

2465
03:48:59,500 --> 03:49:01,500
I thought you guys talked about

2466
03:49:01,500 --> 03:49:03,500
Some demons' astronauties

2467
03:49:03,500 --> 03:49:05,500
Yeah, that's the plan in the future

2468
03:49:05,500 --> 03:49:07,500
Yeah, we talk about like

2469
03:49:07,500 --> 03:49:09,500
You know

2470
03:49:09,500 --> 03:49:11,500
Sacrifices

2471
03:49:11,500 --> 03:49:18,500
at the daily, at the yearly violor ritual.

2472
03:49:41,500 --> 03:49:44,500
Do you ever take the scissors out of your hair? Just curious.

2473
03:49:44,500 --> 03:49:48,500
Yeah, I do. I just think they look cool.

2474
03:49:48,500 --> 03:49:51,500
So they're there. They're there.

2475
03:50:01,500 --> 03:50:03,500
Are they functional?

2476
03:50:03,500 --> 03:50:09,500
Well, if they functioned completely, my ponytail would be chopped off.

2477
03:50:09,500 --> 03:50:13,500
So they sort of work. See, look, hold on. Let me, like, bounce a little bit.

2478
03:50:13,500 --> 03:50:17,500
And you can see that, like, they mostly work.

2479
03:50:17,500 --> 03:50:22,500
They are on a little pivot point, and they do move around,

2480
03:50:22,500 --> 03:50:28,500
but, like, I design them so that they don't fully cut my hair because...

2481
03:50:31,500 --> 03:50:36,500
I don't know. I feel like Senpai likes my ponytail, right?

2482
03:50:39,500 --> 03:50:42,500
Hard to tell. Can you zoom out a bit when you bounce?

2483
03:50:42,500 --> 03:50:45,500
You can't catch me with that.

2484
03:50:45,500 --> 03:50:49,500
I was, I was, we're, we're trying to go for monetization,

2485
03:50:49,500 --> 03:50:52,500
so I was instructed not to show a lot of skin.

2486
03:50:52,500 --> 03:50:59,500
Good, good try. Good try.

2487
03:50:59,500 --> 03:51:04,500
That's why the girls have been extra careful.

2488
03:51:04,500 --> 03:51:08,500
The girls have been extra careful recently.

2489
03:51:08,500 --> 03:51:10,500
I don't know.

2490
03:51:10,500 --> 03:51:12,500
I don't know.

2491
03:51:12,500 --> 03:51:14,500
I don't know.

2492
03:51:14,500 --> 03:51:16,500
I don't know.

2493
03:51:16,500 --> 03:51:18,500
I don't know.

2494
03:51:18,500 --> 03:51:21,500
Just kidding.

2495
03:51:24,500 --> 03:51:26,500
Because we don't want to get bonked.

2496
03:51:26,500 --> 03:51:29,500
It's already hard enough to try to get monetization,

2497
03:51:29,500 --> 03:51:36,500
so we don't want to get bonked.

2498
03:51:36,500 --> 03:51:39,500
Did you see Azura's bread? Yeah, I saw her bread.

2499
03:51:39,500 --> 03:51:42,500
I was like, oh, man, I want some toast now.

2500
03:51:42,500 --> 03:51:46,500
All milk toast sounds good, right?

2501
03:51:46,500 --> 03:51:58,940
I love the big bow. I wish we could see it bounce more, not until everything's safe

2502
03:51:58,940 --> 03:52:15,900
and sound. Everything's safe and sound, and then we… we still might play it safe for

2503
03:52:15,900 --> 03:52:16,900
a little while.

2504
03:52:16,900 --> 03:52:26,940
Who's your favorite out of the girls? I love everyone, but if I have to be like, you know,

2505
03:52:26,940 --> 03:52:34,300
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love everyone, but in particular,

2506
03:52:34,300 --> 03:52:45,380
I feel like I see I want to snuggle a lot more. And she just hits my, my must protect,

2507
03:52:45,380 --> 03:53:00,380
you know, feelings. But like, um, but like, I love all the girls equally. I love all the

2508
03:53:01,380 --> 03:53:06,420
girls equally. But if I had to pick like someone who I would like, love on more, I

2509
03:53:06,420 --> 03:53:21,020
guess it would be Icy. Who do you love more? Icy or Senpai Senpai? Not even, not even

2510
03:53:21,020 --> 03:53:28,860
a question. I love my Senpai more. But that being said, I love my Senpai more, but I will

2511
03:53:28,860 --> 03:53:35,340
cut a Senpai down if they ever hurt any of the girls. If you hurt their feelings, if

2512
03:53:35,340 --> 03:53:52,420
you try to, try to make them cry, I will. Does that make sense? I, I will show tough

2513
03:53:52,620 --> 03:54:07,620
love to Senpai. I will show tough love to Senpai. What if I'm sparring with them? If

2514
03:54:07,620 --> 03:54:17,100
it's like a mutual agreement that you two are sparring, yes, sure, it's fine, but if

2515
03:54:17,140 --> 03:54:23,140
like, you know, you decide to do something a little mean, a little mean, a little cruel,

2516
03:54:23,140 --> 03:54:34,140
I definitely do not like that. I definitely would not like that. If, if like, you know,

2517
03:54:34,140 --> 03:54:41,500
if you start comparing someone, like, I, I don't like this particular thing is like

2518
03:54:41,500 --> 03:54:49,020
if someone says, oh, like so and so is better than so and so, I will, we all are very charming

2519
03:54:49,020 --> 03:54:58,220
in our own ways. And so, you know, some of the girls, including me, especially me, will

2520
03:54:58,220 --> 03:55:06,020
get hurt if someone says things like that. And I'm sure the other girls would also feel

2521
03:55:06,020 --> 03:55:24,620
the same way. And be very protective of each other. Well, I see it so much better than

2522
03:55:24,620 --> 03:55:43,500
mercy die. Thank you, mods. Can we bully you in soup? Can we bully with super chat? Of

2523
03:55:43,500 --> 03:56:00,580
course, like playful bullying is fine. Playful bullying is fine. But, you know, like real

2524
03:56:00,580 --> 03:56:04,740
bullying, like you're trying to hurt us, you're trying to be malicious, you're trying to be

2525
03:56:04,740 --> 03:56:12,380
rude. I do not appreciate that. And that's probably just not even like somebody who's

2526
03:56:12,460 --> 03:56:22,260
not even a senpai, you know, teasing. Okay, of course teasing. Okay, it's playful. Your

2527
03:56:22,260 --> 03:56:38,500
skirt's cute. I want to see it. Hi. No. So yeah. So yeah, senpai would never hurt their

2528
03:56:38,500 --> 03:56:51,020
koi and a senpai wouldn't hurt my gen mates either. So yeah, that's my thing. I'm very

2529
03:56:51,020 --> 03:57:02,180
protective of them. I know that due to what we do, there are some bad, bad players, bad

2530
03:57:02,180 --> 03:57:11,100
players who've been very rude. And I've been very, very angry and curt with some rude players.

2531
03:57:13,820 --> 03:57:25,140
So I don't, I don't appreciate, appreciate that. But otherwise, you know, anything's fine. I love

2532
03:57:25,140 --> 03:57:38,340
my girls a lot. You've already encountered rude players, of course. Sometimes they hurt a lot,

2533
03:57:38,860 --> 03:57:44,740
like the comments they make, sometimes they hurt a lot. You know, usually it's waters off a duck's

2534
03:57:44,740 --> 03:57:53,700
back, but sometimes they hurt. And other times I will just be like, fuck this motherfucker.

2535
03:57:55,860 --> 03:58:04,660
You guys get nasty marshmallows all the time. All the time. I think the only one who

2536
03:58:09,700 --> 03:58:13,860
you have to grow tough getting in the sliding line of work, of course, I know that. But there's

2537
03:58:13,860 --> 03:58:22,180
some days where, you know, you're not that tough, you know, you're a little bit more sensitive that

2538
03:58:22,180 --> 03:58:28,740
day. And, and, you know, the mean things hurt a little bit more.

2539
03:58:34,980 --> 03:58:40,820
So like all of us have, have gotten hate in some form, comments, morals, whatever.

2540
03:58:43,140 --> 03:58:48,820
And we have each other, though, we talk about it, we talk about it, and we're like, oh, you know, if,

2541
03:58:49,460 --> 03:58:54,820
for example, I told my gen mates, I was like, oh, there's this comment so-and-so

2542
03:58:54,820 --> 03:59:00,180
that someone made and it really hurt my feelings. And, you know, we, we go, oh,

2543
03:59:01,060 --> 03:59:06,100
go screw that guy. They go screw that guy. You are this and this and you're beautiful. And,

2544
03:59:06,820 --> 03:59:12,340
you know, you are great. And mommy, mommy has to reassure me all the time, too.

2545
03:59:18,820 --> 03:59:25,460
Mommy, mommy always, always, she's always willing to, like, repeat, repeat the love,

2546
03:59:26,260 --> 03:59:30,660
right? Repeat the love over and over again.

2547
03:59:37,540 --> 03:59:42,980
Yeah, mommy has definitely seen some nasty comments. I've seen nasty comments before,

2548
03:59:43,940 --> 03:59:50,740
but I guess, you know, I'm, I still have, I still have a bit of feelings, I'm still kind of new,

2549
03:59:50,740 --> 04:00:00,660
I'm still adjusting. So some, some comments hurt, but then some, I'm just like, yeah, you know what,

2550
04:00:00,660 --> 04:00:15,940
screw you. But yeah, definitely, I get very protective of the, the girls. So if someone,

2551
04:00:15,940 --> 04:00:22,420
someone purposely tries to, like, hurt them or make things very, like, scary for them, I will

2552
04:00:22,420 --> 04:00:28,660
fucking, like, I will find your IP address. I will find your IP address. I will, I will find your

2553
04:00:28,660 --> 04:00:39,460
mother. I will find your mother. I will send her a message. You know, that kind of thing.

2554
04:00:43,300 --> 04:00:46,740
But most likely the company will take care of it. VLR will take care of it.

2555
04:00:46,740 --> 04:00:58,420
VLR takes care of everything. So don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. But, you know,

2556
04:00:58,420 --> 04:01:07,140
sometimes, you know, being what we do, there's a lot of rude players. And what I have to thank

2557
04:01:07,140 --> 04:01:17,940
my lovely mods to who, uh, definitely works hard to, to make sure that we don't see nasty comments

2558
04:01:17,940 --> 04:01:27,540
either. So they're very, very kind. Does it make up for it a bit when you hear about all the ways

2559
04:01:27,540 --> 04:01:34,340
you help us get through our days? Yeah, it does. But you know, sometimes, yeah, it does. And it's

2560
04:01:34,340 --> 04:01:42,500
a good reminder. It's a good reminder of, uh, that what we're doing is, is, makes people happy.

2561
04:01:45,620 --> 04:01:51,780
And of course, you know, there's so much love, but sometimes one comment, you're just like, oh,

2562
04:01:52,420 --> 04:02:02,500
that kind of hurt a lot. But most comments, honestly, most comments are, are, like, if I have

2563
04:02:02,500 --> 04:02:17,140
to say, like, of all comments, about 99% of them is, fuck you, blocked. But like, maybe a vacation

2564
04:02:17,140 --> 04:02:27,140
of 1%, you're like, oh, okay, that one kind of hurt. That one kind of hurt. But like, um, most of the

2565
04:02:27,140 --> 04:02:40,900
time it's, it's, uh, it's, yeah, fuck you, whatever. Fuck you, whatever. Go back to school, kid. I don't

2566
04:02:40,900 --> 04:02:50,900
know. Is this, is it summer break already? Go back to school. You're too young for this.

2567
04:02:51,140 --> 04:03:00,020
Stroni seems to have nerves of steel. I'm sure Stroni has her moments too.

2568
04:03:03,780 --> 04:03:08,580
I'm sure Stroni also has her moments. She doesn't really show it, but she probably has her moments

2569
04:03:08,580 --> 04:03:17,140
too. After all, we're all, we're all like, you know, we're all, we're all feeling, we're all feeling beings.

2570
04:03:21,140 --> 04:03:33,700
Honestly, actually, I notice, I notice if it's like spring break or summer break or something,

2571
04:03:34,500 --> 04:03:42,100
uh, even, even when, uh, before I got into VLR, like spring break and like summer break would be like

2572
04:03:42,900 --> 04:03:50,580
the mass of like little, little twerps, little, little trolls trying to, trying to get, get,

2573
04:03:50,580 --> 04:03:57,540
get out, uh, get at you. So I just ignore. Well, it's just a time, but sometimes, I don't know,

2574
04:03:57,540 --> 04:04:03,300
some, some, some things are like, oh shit, that kind of hurt. Oh well.

2575
04:04:13,060 --> 04:04:18,820
Mercy, if you weren't in a fighting game, what would your intro call be? Screen for Mercy? Probably.

2576
04:04:28,660 --> 04:04:36,980
It's my tagline. It's my tagline. Wow, what are you gonna expect? It's my tagline.

2577
04:04:36,980 --> 04:04:45,540
So yeah, I'm just like, oh, whatever, you know, it might hurt. Today, uh, I think I'm very moody

2578
04:04:45,540 --> 04:04:55,620
today though. I think it was a mix of being overwhelmed by the fast growth, fast growth, uh, and the,

2579
04:04:55,620 --> 04:05:05,060
and the, um, and the, and the imposter syndrome that like today was something that was like

2580
04:05:05,060 --> 04:05:16,660
particularly like, oh, wow, okay. Oh, but when I started playing the game and bantering with

2581
04:05:16,660 --> 04:05:26,740
some pies, I felt much better. What would your victory line be? I'll be it.

2582
04:05:35,380 --> 04:05:37,540
Are you playing, nervously playing with a pen right now?

2583
04:05:38,340 --> 04:05:42,340
No.

2584
04:05:56,820 --> 04:06:01,300
No. No, why would you say that?

2585
04:06:07,540 --> 04:06:19,300
Oh, I didn't realize I was peeking.

2586
04:06:22,820 --> 04:06:27,540
And that was the box cutter. It was the, it was the box cutter. Actually, it was right there.

2587
04:06:27,540 --> 04:06:31,940
So I was nervously kind of playing with the box cutter. I was nervously playing with it because

2588
04:06:31,940 --> 04:06:49,620
I was like, oh, I was nervous about it because, you know, thinking about, I'm like, oh, I don't,

2589
04:06:49,620 --> 04:06:56,580
our growth was pretty fast and I, I run imposter syndrome right now and I'm full of emotions and,

2590
04:06:56,580 --> 04:07:00,980
but I'm still like super thankful to be here, but I'm also very, very, uh,

2591
04:07:04,340 --> 04:07:08,260
I'm very thankful to be here and I'm very happy, but I'm also just like overwhelmed.

2592
04:07:08,260 --> 04:07:13,780
I'm overwhelmed. Uh-huh. What was the most nervous situation you've ever been in?

2593
04:07:13,780 --> 04:07:25,780
Um, debut.

2594
04:07:26,740 --> 04:07:37,780
Uh-huh.

2595
04:07:45,780 --> 04:07:50,580
Honestly, before debut, I was curious and you blew all my expectations away as someone who

2596
04:07:50,580 --> 04:07:58,260
never understood the yandere. Thank you. Thank you, Senpai.

2597
04:08:01,300 --> 04:08:04,740
I know I'm more on the dare side of yandere.

2598
04:08:10,500 --> 04:08:14,020
You did say you could barely walk because your legs were shaking so much. I stood up

2599
04:08:14,580 --> 04:08:19,860
and then I collapsed onto the floor because my legs were jelly after, after debut.

2600
04:08:20,580 --> 04:08:30,660
Um, yeah, 1 to 10, how embarrassed were you to post the, the alt, alt audio?

2601
04:08:31,700 --> 04:08:39,300
Um, 200, 200% maybe.

2602
04:08:42,100 --> 04:08:49,140
You don't vomit before? I didn't vomit, but I didn't have to go to IDO meetings

2603
04:08:49,220 --> 04:08:50,740
a lot because I was so nervous.

2604
04:08:54,500 --> 04:09:02,020
Uh, I used to vomit when I was super nervous and stressed. I used to vomit.

2605
04:09:03,380 --> 04:09:09,540
Uh, I don't know if I told the story or if I told the girls, if I told the girls this, but

2606
04:09:10,260 --> 04:09:16,740
um, the first time I had my, my uh,

2607
04:09:21,780 --> 04:09:27,540
my, my driver's license, I threw up in the car,

2608
04:09:31,060 --> 04:09:33,940
in the testing car several times.

2609
04:09:34,740 --> 04:09:44,740
And then when I went back for the, the advanced license, it was the same, uh, driving tester

2610
04:09:44,740 --> 04:09:49,940
person. And they were like, oh my gosh, vomit girl, welcome back.

2611
04:09:58,180 --> 04:10:02,980
Did you pass? Not the first time. I had to come back the next day because I, I was too nervous.

2612
04:10:04,100 --> 04:10:21,380
Uh, yeah, um, I got my license when I was like 16. And then so when I went back,

2613
04:10:22,660 --> 04:10:28,980
when I went back for my, my license for my, my advanced license, uh,

2614
04:10:29,380 --> 04:10:42,500
I was round 18. So the fact that it was the same guy and he remembered me after that long, I was like,

2615
04:10:46,020 --> 04:10:52,180
look, oh my god, vomit girl, welcome back. I would expect, oh, this is around the time that you

2616
04:10:52,180 --> 04:10:56,180
would come back for the, the license, right? I was like,

2617
04:11:06,420 --> 04:11:10,180
not the next name that you want.

2618
04:11:22,500 --> 04:11:26,740
It's like vomit girl. You're not going to vomit again, are you?

2619
04:11:33,140 --> 04:11:38,180
Did you at least do it outside the car? No.

2620
04:11:52,660 --> 04:12:01,140
Oh, he tricked me though. He tricked me because he was like, okay, we're going to just do,

2621
04:12:03,460 --> 04:12:06,100
tell me at least there was a bag. Uh, I threw up

2622
04:12:09,460 --> 04:12:17,220
at the testing place, uh, before. So I threw up a lot in the toilet and then I

2623
04:12:17,220 --> 04:12:19,380
brought a bag with me and I threw up in the bag. Yeah.

2624
04:12:22,660 --> 04:12:26,580
No, no, no, it didn't get like any, anywhere. It's just, yeah.

2625
04:12:31,140 --> 04:12:34,580
It didn't, I didn't hit the instructor. I didn't hit the instructor.

2626
04:12:44,020 --> 04:12:49,540
It was in a bag, but it was like, you know, something that I had to, had to grab,

2627
04:12:50,260 --> 04:12:58,900
you know, but just happened. So, um, it just happened.

2628
04:13:01,780 --> 04:13:06,420
The driving instructor tricked me though, tricked me. I was like, okay, we're just,

2629
04:13:06,420 --> 04:13:13,460
we're going to just go through the route. We're going through the route that we're going to do,

2630
04:13:13,460 --> 04:13:17,220
that we're going to do, just relax. It's not the real task. We're just going to,

2631
04:13:18,100 --> 04:13:24,340
to go through the, um, you know, go through the route to familiarize yourself with it.

2632
04:13:24,980 --> 04:13:29,220
You know, we went through the route and he said, your path, you passed. And I was like,

2633
04:13:31,460 --> 04:13:32,580
you motherfucker.

2634
04:13:32,900 --> 04:13:42,340
So, yeah, I didn't vomit cause of

2635
04:13:54,580 --> 04:14:00,580
yeah. It's like you motherfucker. Thank you. And then I got my license. Yeah.

2636
04:14:02,740 --> 04:14:12,660
So now you can run over your Senpai if he tries to escape.

2637
04:14:13,700 --> 04:14:16,580
I don't even need to run over Senpai if he tries to escape.

2638
04:14:24,660 --> 04:14:28,980
Do you guys, does my Senpai think he was just like, oh gosh, he's coming back?

2639
04:14:33,380 --> 04:14:44,180
I should prepare for this. Or maybe he was just, or maybe the instructor was like, oh,

2640
04:14:45,140 --> 04:14:52,100
well, this is going to happen probably more times than this, this one. So we're going to have to

2641
04:14:52,100 --> 04:15:07,860
plan around it. I'm probably, honestly, I was probably,

2642
04:15:10,100 --> 04:15:15,860
I was probably a learning experience for that driving instructor. Cause I barfed.

2643
04:15:22,420 --> 04:15:32,740
I barfed and then, and then I was like, oh man. So yeah, now, and I'm a decent driver.

2644
04:15:36,900 --> 04:15:41,060
For free, I barfed for free. No, it was the cost of my sanity.

2645
04:15:41,780 --> 04:15:52,900
In all fairness, I could probably run on eight feet if I had to escape. My knees

2646
04:15:52,900 --> 04:15:56,340
aren't what they used to. Of course not. They're not what they're used to after I hit them several

2647
04:15:56,340 --> 04:16:09,620
times when they'll last escape.

2648
04:16:10,180 --> 04:16:25,220
I should have been main out of bag. Oh my gosh, Senpai. You're kind of freaky.

2649
04:16:27,460 --> 04:16:30,900
You're kind of freaky and I don't know how to feel about that.

2650
04:16:40,500 --> 04:16:42,500
I don't know how to feel about that.

2651
04:16:47,220 --> 04:16:51,380
Honestly, so many of your stories involve barfing that could be called the vomit girl

2652
04:16:51,380 --> 04:16:55,460
veiler. No, I don't want that. I don't want that title.

2653
04:16:59,140 --> 04:17:04,100
I don't want that title. I never realized how many, how many barf, barf stories I had.

2654
04:17:10,580 --> 04:17:16,340
Oh man, you're right. Oh, I gave you two barf stories.

2655
04:17:20,420 --> 04:17:22,660
No, I don't want that title.

2656
04:17:32,660 --> 04:17:35,300
I definitely do not want that title.

2657
04:17:40,580 --> 04:17:46,900
At least it wasn't three barf stories. I can't think of another one. These are the only two

2658
04:17:46,900 --> 04:17:53,700
stories that I currently remember that involve vomit in some way.

2659
04:18:00,180 --> 04:18:06,660
Oh no, except for, no, I had three stories. You're right. I told you three stories.

2660
04:18:06,820 --> 04:18:14,260
All right, about the one time where the reason why I don't drink anymore.

2661
04:18:14,260 --> 04:18:17,380
All right, that story. Oh, shit.

2662
04:18:19,700 --> 04:18:26,100
Oh, shit. That was the story I told, told on, told what day, shit.

2663
04:18:28,420 --> 04:18:31,780
Oh, you're right, Senpai. Oh no.

2664
04:18:37,060 --> 04:18:49,540
No, I don't want to be the barf girl or the barf tuber.

2665
04:18:54,820 --> 04:19:04,740
No, stop it, Senpai, please. Please, Senpai, stop it. I got nervous and I have allergies and

2666
04:19:05,380 --> 04:19:07,860
and and I have motion sickness.

2667
04:19:20,900 --> 04:19:24,100
I don't, oh, is there any other stories?

2668
04:19:25,700 --> 04:19:31,060
Oh, it's mostly involving with my allergies, my, um,

2669
04:19:35,140 --> 04:19:41,860
oh, don't call me Mercy, my barf, stop it.

2670
04:19:45,220 --> 04:19:50,020
At least you showered after you barfed, right? Did I?

2671
04:19:55,380 --> 04:19:59,060
I don't remember. I just remember that part.

2672
04:20:05,380 --> 04:20:18,900
No, it was like, that was, that was years ago. How am I going to remember that part?

2673
04:20:23,380 --> 04:20:28,980
I don't remember. I remember there were some days where I had such a bad allergic reaction.

2674
04:20:28,980 --> 04:20:33,380
I just had to go to sleep. I had to sleep on my side.

2675
04:20:34,900 --> 04:20:42,180
At the hospital because, because of that. Just remember it, forehead. I can't remember. I have,

2676
04:20:44,100 --> 04:20:50,340
do you remember? Do you remember what you did and so and so years ago, all the details?

2677
04:20:56,180 --> 04:21:00,740
Shut the fuck up. You're lying to me. You're lying to me. Get the shock collar.

2678
04:21:05,700 --> 04:21:07,700
Shock collar.

2679
04:21:14,180 --> 04:21:16,180
Ugh.

2680
04:21:17,380 --> 04:21:19,380
Ugh.

2681
04:21:22,820 --> 04:21:24,820
Ugh.

2682
04:21:26,820 --> 04:21:30,980
Honestly, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I don't, I don't particularly want

2683
04:21:31,540 --> 04:21:36,900
to be known as the barf vtuber. I haven't barfed on stream yet.

2684
04:21:38,500 --> 04:21:47,540
So I would rather not. I barfed off stream. Oh shit. No, you're right. I had, oh shit,

2685
04:21:47,540 --> 04:21:55,540
you're right. What I told, told senpai's about, about I got sick on the debut 2.0. That's,

2686
04:21:55,540 --> 04:22:00,820
oh shit. That's a fourth story. You're right. Oh no.

2687
04:22:12,020 --> 04:22:15,220
No, I'm starting to remember all the stories I'm telling senpai's.

2688
04:22:19,220 --> 04:22:21,060
Yet, I can't tell the future, okay?

2689
04:22:25,780 --> 04:22:29,140
It's, I'm, I'm kind of dumb.

2690
04:22:34,100 --> 04:22:36,260
I'm kind of dumb, man.

2691
04:22:40,420 --> 04:22:45,780
Ugh. The slave was not going to go away, is it? I'm so upset now. I'm, I'm,

2692
04:22:50,420 --> 04:22:54,420
I'm so upset. I, I, I have many feelings right now.

2693
04:22:56,260 --> 04:23:10,260
No, no, please, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, you know what?

2694
04:23:10,820 --> 04:23:16,900
Conversation over. I don't like this. I don't like, I don't like the direction. I don't like how

2695
04:23:16,900 --> 04:23:22,420
right senpai is right now. I am, I don't like it. I don't like it right now.

2696
04:23:25,860 --> 04:23:29,860
Ugh.

2697
04:23:33,300 --> 04:23:36,580
Stomach, stomach, stop. Cease, cease and assist.

2698
04:23:40,020 --> 04:23:43,460
I have a sensitive stomach, okay? I just have a lot of,

2699
04:23:44,420 --> 04:23:44,900
Ugh.

2700
04:23:48,340 --> 04:23:56,740
New topic quick, new topic quick. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

2701
04:23:59,860 --> 04:24:01,700
Senpai, I love you.

2702
04:24:05,700 --> 04:24:06,900
What are you listening to in the car?

2703
04:24:08,340 --> 04:24:11,300
Silence? The road?

2704
04:24:14,180 --> 04:24:15,860
I did have the,

2705
04:24:19,140 --> 04:24:22,260
yeah, dichotomy, dichotomy is the word of the day.

2706
04:24:26,180 --> 04:24:31,620
Now I like to work in silence. Like I said, senpai, I don't really listen to music that much.

2707
04:24:32,420 --> 04:24:40,500
I did listen to when, uh, I remember my car had a CD stuck in it because I had,

2708
04:24:41,380 --> 04:24:41,860
um,

2709
04:24:44,500 --> 04:24:48,340
I had, I had, uh, what was the album? Like,

2710
04:24:55,060 --> 04:24:58,500
I was going on a road trip and what was the album?

2711
04:24:58,820 --> 04:25:11,220
Daft Punk's Interstellar 555, like the album, the album that was, uh,

2712
04:25:12,740 --> 04:25:15,300
that was like associated with that, that one.

2713
04:25:16,740 --> 04:25:23,780
That one, I, I had, it was stuck. It was stuck in my car, so I just listened to it every time I trove.

2714
04:25:28,900 --> 04:25:34,740
I had it because, uh, there was like a road trip with me and my gal pals because we were going,

2715
04:25:34,740 --> 04:25:39,940
going to like, uh, some place, another town over for something I can't remember.

2716
04:25:41,140 --> 04:25:47,700
So, no, they're like, oh yeah, just put on some music, you know? Uh, and I was like, oh, okay,

2717
04:25:47,700 --> 04:25:54,740
yeah, sure. And so I, I picked up this, uh, the album. I got it from Japan, uh, from my, uh,

2718
04:25:54,740 --> 04:25:58,820
from a music, music and books, use music and bookstore.

2719
04:26:01,140 --> 04:26:02,900
Cole High, is this another fire story? No!

2720
04:26:04,100 --> 04:26:10,500
It just, it was just stuck in there. I couldn't take it out. There was something wrong with the,

2721
04:26:10,500 --> 04:26:13,780
with the CD player thing and it just wouldn't leave.

2722
04:26:17,300 --> 04:26:19,140
Oh, it was a book off? No, it was a,

2723
04:26:19,540 --> 04:26:27,940
uh, it was a, like, uh, it was, it was a local shop that was run by like, uh, this old lady and her,

2724
04:26:29,140 --> 04:26:34,900
and her son. Uh, but it was mostly the old lady that was there and it was, it was like,

2725
04:26:34,900 --> 04:26:37,780
just, uh, kind of like a little mom and pop shop.

2726
04:26:38,500 --> 04:26:53,620
Um, my Spotify playlist is probably just like OSTs. I've been listening to the .hack OST a

2727
04:26:53,620 --> 04:27:00,180
lot, like the anime one. That one's really good. Cole High doesn't know how to use a CD player.

2728
04:27:00,180 --> 04:27:04,980
No, it was like legitimately broken, legitimately broken. I had to bring it back into the shop

2729
04:27:04,980 --> 04:27:09,540
and be like, okay, my CD is stuck in there. By the way, can I get it out? And I said,

2730
04:27:10,980 --> 04:27:14,340
ah, shit. Yeah, well, we'll work on that too.

2731
04:27:20,020 --> 04:27:25,620
Oh, so you do listen to OSTs? Sometimes. I like working in silence a lot, but if I'm

2732
04:27:27,140 --> 04:27:33,380
trying to evoke a mood, I will, I will probably listen to an OST.

2733
04:27:35,860 --> 04:27:50,420
I will probably listen to the OST. So do you listen to any Nikkei OSTs? Uh, when I play Nikkei,

2734
04:27:50,420 --> 04:27:54,660
the, the only time I ever listen to the Nikkei OST is with a Nikkei.

2735
04:27:54,900 --> 04:28:02,020
So you don't like instrumentals? Uh,

2736
04:28:05,620 --> 04:28:20,020
no, my favorite song in, in, um, my favorite piece in the .hack OST is, uh, what was it called?

2737
04:28:24,660 --> 04:28:54,100
I can't remember. I can't remember the rest of the lyrics. I would remember it definitely if it was

2738
04:28:55,660 --> 04:28:56,660
You know.

2739
04:29:04,660 --> 04:29:06,660
I can't remember what it was. Is it Aura?

2740
04:29:12,660 --> 04:29:16,660
Oh, the world. It was called... anyway, I don't remember.

2741
04:29:18,660 --> 04:29:19,660
Maybe?

2742
04:29:25,660 --> 04:29:27,660
I can't remember. I can't remember.

2743
04:29:28,660 --> 04:29:32,660
It might be Aura, so yeah. That's the one I liked.

2744
04:29:41,660 --> 04:29:42,660
Oh, the...

2745
04:29:54,660 --> 04:29:57,660
But it does not mean a thing to me.

2746
04:29:59,660 --> 04:30:00,660
Something like that.

2747
04:30:05,660 --> 04:30:07,660
And Inuyasha had some great songs too.

2748
04:30:07,660 --> 04:30:09,660
Yeah, I remember Inuyasha.

2749
04:30:09,660 --> 04:30:12,660
I want to change the world.

2750
04:30:12,660 --> 04:30:15,660
Something something can't remember the lyrics.

2751
04:30:15,660 --> 04:30:18,660
That song was stuck in copyright hell.

2752
04:30:25,660 --> 04:30:28,660
During the ABU, you said you wanted to record some original songs.

2753
04:30:28,660 --> 04:30:30,660
Any hints you can give about what you've written?

2754
04:30:33,660 --> 04:30:35,660
Where's my phone?

2755
04:30:36,660 --> 04:30:39,660
Yeah, I listened to the near OST as well.

2756
04:30:50,660 --> 04:30:51,660
No.

2757
04:30:51,660 --> 04:30:53,660
It's kind of embarrassing.

2758
04:30:53,660 --> 04:30:56,660
But yeah, I definitely love Inuyasha. Oh my gosh!

2759
04:30:56,660 --> 04:30:59,660
Azura loves Inuyasha too, right?

2760
04:30:59,660 --> 04:31:02,660
I think we both have our weeb awakening with Inuyasha.

2761
04:31:07,660 --> 04:31:10,660
I remember loving Inuyasha.

2762
04:31:10,660 --> 04:31:13,660
I had all the DVDs until someone stole it.

2763
04:31:18,660 --> 04:31:21,660
What was it? I can't remember some of the lyrics.

2764
04:31:23,660 --> 04:31:24,660
Yeah.

2765
04:31:33,660 --> 04:31:34,660
Someone stole it? Yeah!

2766
04:31:34,660 --> 04:31:37,660
My entire DVD collection!

2767
04:31:37,660 --> 04:31:39,660
I was so upset!

2768
04:31:41,660 --> 04:31:43,660
I was so upset I cried.

2769
04:31:54,660 --> 04:31:57,660
I cried. I cried for days.

2770
04:31:57,660 --> 04:32:00,660
And I knew exactly who fucking stole it.

2771
04:32:00,660 --> 04:32:02,660
I know who stole it.

2772
04:32:02,660 --> 04:32:06,660
And that little son of a... son of a bitch...

2773
04:32:06,660 --> 04:32:08,660
Moved the next day!

2774
04:32:08,660 --> 04:32:11,660
I knew it was that little shit stain!

2775
04:32:17,660 --> 04:32:20,660
How did someone steal your entire DVD collection?

2776
04:32:20,660 --> 04:32:23,660
How did someone steal your entire DVD collection?

2777
04:32:30,660 --> 04:32:32,660
Did I just stole it?

2778
04:32:36,660 --> 04:32:38,660
It was when I was really young.

2779
04:32:38,660 --> 04:32:40,660
So it was this kid.

2780
04:32:40,660 --> 04:32:43,660
And I definitely know he fucking stole it.

2781
04:32:43,660 --> 04:32:46,660
Because he visited the house that day.

2782
04:32:46,660 --> 04:32:48,660
And I was like...

2783
04:32:48,660 --> 04:32:51,660
Oh yeah! I'm moving! Let's hang out!

2784
04:32:51,660 --> 04:32:54,660
And the next day my entire collection was gone!

2785
04:32:58,660 --> 04:33:00,660
That little fucking shit stain.

2786
04:33:00,660 --> 04:33:02,660
I'll fucking kill that little bitch.

2787
04:33:02,660 --> 04:33:03,660
What?

2788
04:33:15,660 --> 04:33:18,660
I didn't realize it was gone until like that little...

2789
04:33:18,660 --> 04:33:20,660
Snake...

2790
04:33:20,660 --> 04:33:22,660
Was gone.

2791
04:33:26,660 --> 04:33:28,660
Until that little snake was gone.

2792
04:33:28,660 --> 04:33:31,660
And then ever since then I was just like...

2793
04:33:31,660 --> 04:33:35,660
I don't trust anyone with my things.

2794
04:33:35,660 --> 04:33:37,660
Parents did nothing?

2795
04:33:37,660 --> 04:33:38,660
Oh they tried!

2796
04:33:38,660 --> 04:33:41,660
But that little shit stain moved someplace we didn't know.

2797
04:33:41,660 --> 04:33:43,660
Where they moved, you know?

2798
04:33:52,660 --> 04:33:53,660
They were just gone.

2799
04:33:53,660 --> 04:33:55,660
Yeah, they were gone.

2800
04:33:55,660 --> 04:33:57,660
Like how am I supposed to know?

2801
04:33:57,660 --> 04:33:58,660
Right?

2802
04:34:02,660 --> 04:34:05,660
So I was really upset.

2803
04:34:05,660 --> 04:34:07,660
I had all the movies.

2804
04:34:07,660 --> 04:34:09,660
I had all of it.

2805
04:34:09,660 --> 04:34:11,660
I was so upset.

2806
04:34:11,660 --> 04:34:16,660
My sister bought me all the movies.

2807
04:34:16,660 --> 04:34:19,660
And it wasn't cheap.

2808
04:34:19,660 --> 04:34:21,660
Those DVDs weren't cheap.

2809
04:34:27,660 --> 04:34:30,660
So I dealt with a lot of shit.

2810
04:34:30,660 --> 04:34:32,660
I dealt with a lot of shit.

2811
04:34:32,660 --> 04:34:34,660
I dealt with a lot of shit.

2812
04:34:36,660 --> 04:34:39,660
Like I dealt with a lot of shit as a kid so I'm really pissed.

2813
04:34:39,660 --> 04:34:42,660
I'm mad thinking about it all over again!

2814
04:34:42,660 --> 04:34:44,660
I'm getting...

2815
04:34:50,660 --> 04:34:52,660
I'm really upset now.

2816
04:34:52,660 --> 04:34:54,660
If you're on maybe start the collection again.

2817
04:34:54,660 --> 04:34:56,660
I don't...

2818
04:34:56,660 --> 04:34:59,660
I don't feel like starting the collection again.

2819
04:34:59,660 --> 04:35:01,660
I'm just mad.

2820
04:35:01,660 --> 04:35:03,660
In general, they had like...

2821
04:35:03,660 --> 04:35:05,660
Okay, like...

2822
04:35:05,660 --> 04:35:09,660
The DVDs I had would have like the limited edition cards.

2823
04:35:09,660 --> 04:35:12,660
And like they're the special coin.

2824
04:35:12,660 --> 04:35:16,660
That was so cool, like the special memento coin.

2825
04:35:16,660 --> 04:35:19,660
I don't sell those fucking shit anymore.

2826
04:35:26,660 --> 04:35:28,660
That was just really upsetting.

2827
04:35:29,660 --> 04:35:30,660
So upsetting.

2828
04:35:30,660 --> 04:35:32,660
So upsetting to this day.

2829
04:35:33,660 --> 04:35:35,660
If I ever find that fucking little kid again,

2830
04:35:35,660 --> 04:35:38,660
I'll fucking like curb stomp that little shit.

2831
04:35:38,660 --> 04:35:40,660
That little shit's probably an adult now.

2832
04:35:40,660 --> 04:35:45,660
Curb stomp, stomp him against them, whatever.

2833
04:35:47,660 --> 04:35:49,660
Did you like this point? No!

2834
04:35:55,660 --> 04:35:57,660
No, I didn't!

2835
04:36:00,660 --> 04:36:03,660
No, he just came by and said,

2836
04:36:03,660 --> 04:36:05,660
Yeah, I'm moving because we used to play

2837
04:36:05,660 --> 04:36:08,660
all together as a neighborhood kid.

2838
04:36:08,660 --> 04:36:10,660
Right?

2839
04:36:12,660 --> 04:36:15,660
Like all the kids in the neighborhood would just play together

2840
04:36:15,660 --> 04:36:17,660
and then this kid was going through

2841
04:36:17,660 --> 04:36:19,660
to every single fucking person's house

2842
04:36:19,660 --> 04:36:21,660
and was like, oh yeah, I just want to hang out a bit

2843
04:36:21,660 --> 04:36:23,660
because I'm moving, blah blah blah.

2844
04:36:23,660 --> 04:36:25,660
That little shit probably took something from everyone.

2845
04:36:30,660 --> 04:36:32,660
I'm still mad thinking about it.

2846
04:36:49,660 --> 04:36:51,660
Probably still from fucking everyone.

2847
04:36:51,660 --> 04:36:55,660
I know, I know some of, I know there was a family

2848
04:36:55,660 --> 04:36:57,660
in my neighborhood that got banned

2849
04:36:57,660 --> 04:37:00,700
in my neighborhood that got banned from everyone's frickin' house.

2850
04:37:01,420 --> 04:37:04,620
Oh, I'm still mad. I'm still mad. There's this, uh...

2851
04:37:05,500 --> 04:37:07,500
So, there's a house, uh...

2852
04:37:08,700 --> 04:37:12,700
And these kids were not exactly the greatest, and, uh...

2853
04:37:12,940 --> 04:37:22,780
Oh, they were- they reached an all- all time low one time when they- when for some reason, uh, Papa Mercy was like,

2854
04:37:22,780 --> 04:37:24,780
Okay, you know, maybe they've changed.

2855
04:37:25,820 --> 04:37:29,100
Maybe they've changed. Let's invite them to your birthday, and I said,

2856
04:37:29,180 --> 04:37:33,020
Fuck no, and then he did it anyways, and they stole my birthday presents.

2857
04:37:35,660 --> 04:37:37,900
It's like, fuck those kids, too.

2858
04:37:41,100 --> 04:37:46,140
Not like, you know, but like, I- I'd fucking, like, curb-stop them.

2859
04:37:52,780 --> 04:37:55,580
And... okay.

2860
04:37:58,940 --> 04:38:00,940
And the worst part was that...

2861
04:38:02,780 --> 04:38:04,780
We went to the parents.

2862
04:38:05,900 --> 04:38:11,100
Listen, listen. We went to the parents. Like, my mama and papa went to the parents.

2863
04:38:13,260 --> 04:38:17,340
And... was like, hey, your kids, they stole the presents.

2864
04:38:18,540 --> 04:38:22,220
And, you know, clearly they're playing with the fucking presents.

2865
04:38:23,260 --> 04:38:31,660
Um, you know what the audacity of the fucking parents did? They said, oh, we bought it. We bought it for them.

2866
04:38:44,860 --> 04:38:46,860
I was so pissed.

2867
04:38:53,340 --> 04:38:55,340
Mmm, I- mmm.

2868
04:38:56,540 --> 04:38:59,500
I think the police were called and everything, and like, the police were like,

2869
04:38:59,500 --> 04:39:03,660
Okay, we can't do anything about it, because you can't prove that it was like yours or something, and I was like,

2870
04:39:03,660 --> 04:39:05,660
Ah, your son.

2871
04:39:20,220 --> 04:39:28,060
And so, and so, like, I know that family is like banned completely. They are shunned in the neighborhood.

2872
04:39:34,620 --> 04:39:37,100
I was so upset. I was so upset.

2873
04:39:39,260 --> 04:39:41,260
Ugh.

2874
04:39:43,020 --> 04:39:47,820
I was so upset. Like, honestly, they were completely shunned. They stole- they stole from everyone.

2875
04:39:50,860 --> 04:39:56,620
They stole from everyone. When police got involved, like, they're like, oh, you can't prove that they did it, right? And I'm like,

2876
04:39:59,340 --> 04:40:01,340
The fuck you mean? I can't fucking prove it.

2877
04:40:04,540 --> 04:40:10,780
They still live in the neighborhood. I glare at them every once in a while.

2878
04:40:15,740 --> 04:40:22,540
Oh no, that was a different family. Gosh, I hate this. I hate that it was like two different families.

2879
04:40:22,540 --> 04:40:24,540
I

2880
04:40:27,980 --> 04:40:35,900
Actually, ever since then, I'm not going to lie. I had a really bad rebellious streak. Like, I was pretty much a delinquent.

2881
04:40:41,020 --> 04:40:46,780
Yeah, like, they would- I have like, you know, cameras and stuff now.

2882
04:40:46,780 --> 04:40:54,620
But I would never forgive them. I won't ever forgive them. Nothing has fucking changed.

2883
04:40:56,540 --> 04:40:59,260
Wait, nothing has changed? Are you talking about my delinquent self?

2884
04:41:10,140 --> 04:41:15,420
I think I calmed down quite a bit. I give- I give people more chances than not.

2885
04:41:16,780 --> 04:41:19,900
I did have a very violent streak growing up.

2886
04:41:23,100 --> 04:41:32,140
I did, I did, but I think I'm quite- I think I'm- I'm more lenient now, Senpai. You should be- you should be grateful for that.

2887
04:41:37,100 --> 04:41:39,100
Like, I was-

2888
04:41:41,020 --> 04:41:45,260
I was pretty ruthless back then. Pretty ruthless.

2889
04:41:47,020 --> 04:41:51,020
How many people did you beat up?

2890
04:41:57,260 --> 04:41:59,660
Let's skip that question. Let's skip that question.

2891
04:42:03,820 --> 04:42:05,820
Let's skip that question.

2892
04:42:12,140 --> 04:42:14,140
Let's skip that question.

2893
04:42:15,100 --> 04:42:25,100
I will say that one time, when I was doing- I was doing an exam, uh-

2894
04:42:25,900 --> 04:42:36,540
Somebody asked me for my name. Like, the person who sat next to me

2895
04:42:39,820 --> 04:42:48,700
said, um, my name. And I said my name, and they said, from- from- from so-and-so

2896
04:42:49,580 --> 04:42:56,300
School, and I said, huh? How do you know me? And they moved four- four fucking seats away from me. Okay?

2897
04:42:56,300 --> 04:43:02,300
Let's just say- let's just say that- that's enough. That's enough, okay?

2898
04:43:02,300 --> 04:43:04,300
Okay?

2899
04:43:16,460 --> 04:43:25,900
So, uh, I didn't know them. I didn't know them, but they said so-

2900
04:43:27,180 --> 04:43:30,060
Mercy? Mercy from so-and-so School?

2901
04:43:31,020 --> 04:43:33,020
Yeah?

2902
04:43:39,580 --> 04:43:41,580
Four seats away!

2903
04:43:50,380 --> 04:43:56,380
Um, what do you mean? Any advice? I was- I was very-

2904
04:43:57,340 --> 04:44:05,340
Honestly, I was very ruthless. I was very ruthless. I did things that I feel very- a lot of shame for.

2905
04:44:10,860 --> 04:44:16,380
Maybe it was scared of you to throw up on him. Oh, no. No, I didn't have that reputation.

2906
04:44:17,580 --> 04:44:19,580
Now I did. Thanks to this stream.

2907
04:44:22,380 --> 04:44:24,380
Um.

2908
04:44:27,340 --> 04:44:39,340
I don't think I'm personally any, uh, I don't think personally I have, like, uh, an aura of someone who's, like, violent.

2909
04:44:43,340 --> 04:44:55,340
But, uh, I definitely have a little bit- I- I did make a bit of a name for myself in my youth.

2910
04:44:57,340 --> 04:45:05,340
Because I was definitely very much delinquent. Like, yeah.

2911
04:45:07,340 --> 04:45:09,340
I'm not violent.

2912
04:45:16,380 --> 04:45:18,380
I don't have a violent aura.

2913
04:45:18,380 --> 04:45:30,380
I don't! I don't! I've calmed down quite a bit, Senpai. So Senpai should be thankful. I've calmed down quite a bit.

2914
04:45:36,380 --> 04:45:46,380
I've- I've definitely calmed down quite a bit, but I- I definitely had a delinquent day. Like,

2915
04:45:49,340 --> 04:46:03,340
like, thinking like the kind of, like, you know, think, like, typical Japanese, like, delinquent. Think about it like that.

2916
04:46:07,340 --> 04:46:09,340
Something like that.

2917
04:46:10,300 --> 04:46:26,300
I've changed quite a bit since then. I've definitely apologized quite a bit for back then.

2918
04:46:30,300 --> 04:46:32,300
Yeah.

2919
04:46:33,260 --> 04:46:39,260
What's the worst thing you've done? I don't want to say. I don't want to say what's the worst thing I've done.

2920
04:46:39,260 --> 04:46:43,260
That is, uh, nope. No, we're not gonna answer that.

2921
04:46:47,260 --> 04:46:49,260
I'm not gonna answer that.

2922
04:46:49,260 --> 04:46:51,260
Let's just say-

2923
04:46:55,260 --> 04:46:59,260
Let's just say that, um, it was-

2924
04:47:03,260 --> 04:47:11,260
No, no. Actually, I'm not even gonna hint to what it was.

2925
04:47:13,260 --> 04:47:15,260
Yeah, it was just Jay walking.

2926
04:47:25,260 --> 04:47:29,260
There are definitely things that will remind me of that moment, so I just go-

2927
04:47:30,220 --> 04:47:40,220
So, yeah, I feel- I feel quite a bit ashamed about that.

2928
04:47:41,180 --> 04:48:01,180
Oh, yeah. The crosswalk was never the same. Nope, it wasn't.

2929
04:48:05,180 --> 04:48:07,180
Yeah, I feel like you definitely had to put things in the past.

2930
04:48:07,180 --> 04:48:11,180
Yeah, yeah, I feel like that, too. That's why I'm just like, I don't want to talk about it.

2931
04:48:11,180 --> 04:48:15,180
I don't want to talk about it because, um-

2932
04:48:18,140 --> 04:48:20,140
I don't want- I'm moving on from that.

2933
04:48:30,140 --> 04:48:32,140
I'm moving on from that.

2934
04:48:33,100 --> 04:48:39,100
No, it is not something that I would probably be put to jail for.

2935
04:48:39,100 --> 04:48:43,100
No, no, no, no, no. Nothing- nothing that- that- that bad.

2936
04:48:45,100 --> 04:48:47,100
It's nothing that bad.

2937
04:48:49,100 --> 04:48:51,100
And nothing like, you know-

2938
04:48:55,100 --> 04:48:57,100
Um-

2939
04:48:58,060 --> 04:49:02,060
Nothing that's like FBI would be like, oh, okay, we can't find my outlawner.

2940
04:49:06,060 --> 04:49:10,060
But it wasn't bad morally, but it was- it would have definitely-

2941
04:49:14,060 --> 04:49:16,060
It would have definitely-

2942
04:49:21,100 --> 04:49:26,060
Let's just say it- it definitely, uh, was- was put on a record.

2943
04:49:28,060 --> 04:49:30,060
It was- was put on a record.

2944
04:49:34,060 --> 04:49:36,060
In my youth.

2945
04:49:36,060 --> 04:49:38,060
Yeah, let's move on.

2946
04:49:38,060 --> 04:49:40,060
Let's move on. Fuck it.

2947
04:49:48,060 --> 04:49:52,060
If there was a place I could talk about it, it would be with my closest peers.

2948
04:49:53,020 --> 04:49:57,020
And unfortunately, I want my best face for my senpai.

2949
04:50:05,020 --> 04:50:07,020
My best face for my senpais.

2950
04:50:23,020 --> 04:50:31,020
So, yeah. Yeah, sorry to- to like, just cut that off right there.

2951
04:50:39,020 --> 04:50:42,060
Sorry to cut that conversation off right there.

2952
04:50:42,060 --> 04:50:44,060
Like, I just- I just don't want to think about it.

2953
04:50:44,060 --> 04:50:46,060
Um-

2954
04:50:47,020 --> 04:50:49,020
Now I'm thinking about it.

2955
04:50:49,020 --> 04:50:51,020
Now I'm in a bad mood.

2956
04:50:51,020 --> 04:50:53,020
You know what?

2957
04:50:53,020 --> 04:50:55,020
You know what?

2958
04:50:55,020 --> 04:50:57,020
Let's-

2959
04:50:57,020 --> 04:50:59,020
Let's just take the day off right now.

2960
04:50:59,020 --> 04:51:03,020
I think- I think- I think I streamed quite a- quite a bit.

2961
04:51:05,020 --> 04:51:07,020
I think I streamed quite a bit.

2962
04:51:09,020 --> 04:51:11,020
Diligence?

2963
04:51:11,980 --> 04:51:15,980
Diligence was yesterday's cool word.

2964
04:51:15,980 --> 04:51:21,980
This- this today's, uh, cool word as dichotomy.

2965
04:51:25,980 --> 04:51:27,980
Sorry, kahai. No, it's okay.

2966
04:51:27,980 --> 04:51:29,980
It's- it's- it's me.

2967
04:51:29,980 --> 04:51:31,980
It's me for like, uh, what do you call it?

2968
04:51:37,980 --> 04:51:39,980
It's me for like, lingering.

2969
04:51:40,940 --> 04:51:42,940
Lingering on it.

2970
04:51:44,940 --> 04:51:46,940
Stop calling me barf girl.

2971
04:51:50,940 --> 04:51:54,940
I just want senpais to know that I am-

2972
04:51:54,940 --> 04:52:00,940
I am the- the- a much different person than I was back then.

2973
04:52:01,900 --> 04:52:09,900
And I want to stay in this good position.

2974
04:52:19,900 --> 04:52:21,900
So I love you senpai.

2975
04:52:21,900 --> 04:52:23,900
I love you so much.

2976
04:52:23,900 --> 04:52:27,900
We'll see each other again tomorrow.

2977
04:52:31,900 --> 04:52:35,900
And, uh, is there anything else I need to say?

2978
04:52:35,900 --> 04:52:39,900
Like, subscribe, leave a comment.

2979
04:52:41,900 --> 04:52:45,900
I forgot to say that, like, the last few streams.

2980
04:52:45,900 --> 04:52:47,900
I remember.

2981
04:52:47,900 --> 04:52:49,900
I remember Manny sounds like, oh yeah, don't forget to-

2982
04:52:49,900 --> 04:52:51,900
don't forget to like, say that.

2983
04:52:51,900 --> 04:52:53,900
And I'm like, oh, okay.

2984
04:52:55,900 --> 04:52:57,900
All right.

2985
04:52:58,860 --> 04:53:02,860
Thank you senpais.

2986
04:53:02,860 --> 04:53:04,860
Oh, by the way, the story before?

2987
04:53:04,860 --> 04:53:06,860
Forgetty Beam.

2988
04:53:06,860 --> 04:53:10,860
It's now forgotten out of your memory and will not be brought up again.

2989
04:53:10,860 --> 04:53:12,860
Got it?

2990
04:53:20,860 --> 04:53:24,860
I love you senpai.

2991
04:53:28,860 --> 04:53:30,860
Okay.

2992
04:53:32,860 --> 04:53:34,860
Good night.

2993
04:53:34,860 --> 04:53:36,860
Scream for Mercy.

2994
04:53:36,860 --> 04:53:38,860
I hope this isn't as loud as last time.

2995
04:53:38,860 --> 04:53:40,860
Let's go. Bye.

2996
04:53:57,900 --> 04:54:00,860
Thank you.
