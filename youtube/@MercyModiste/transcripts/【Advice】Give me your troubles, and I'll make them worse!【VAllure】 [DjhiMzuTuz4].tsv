904760	909760	that I've been struggling with for many years I've always had self-confidence and
909760	914920	esteem issues that's made it really hard for me to break out of my own shell and
914920	921400	not cringe at every little thing I say or do in public I'm too aware of how I
921520	928400	present myself to others and it's only made me withdrawn over time is there
928400	934000	anything you practice doing before a stream or in general social situations
934000	939360	that help you feel more natural and less anxious any advice you could give me

947080	959760	wish the best for you and be allure okay thank you thank you oh thank you for the
959760	969720	question I may give you a little bit of a serious answer for this one doing my own
969720	996480	story I cringe at this sometimes and remember I went hiking once I went
996480	1002240	hiking once this sounds bad that sounds terrible this was once and I will be very
1002240	1006880	embarrassed about it ever since and so use the story as your pillar of
1006880	1015680	confidence okay pillar of confidence I was hiking in a very popular hiking area
1015680	1023880	it was so unusually crowded at that time okay you see what I'm talking about
1023880	1038160	you're trying to see okay I may have I may have no no it's not vomit shut the
1038160	1048640	shut the fuck up shut the fuck up I'm trying to tell a story here I may have in
1048640	1056960	a moment may have close your ears close your ears close your ears for all those
1056960	1062600	who are sensitive okay okay close your ears
1062600	1072880	I let out I let out I accidentally let out the biggest the biggest toot the biggest toot
1072880	1082880	I let out the biggest toot and about 500 heads
1102880	1123120	so many people look at me you cannot have that worse okay and you know what I'm
1123120	1128960	never gonna see those people ever again that story someone's gonna say that
1128960	1136600	story and in front of their family do their friends they're all gonna tell
1136600	1151440	that start of someone it was in the woods okay
1153880	1163960	they're telling that story to each other and I will want to tell you that those
1163960	1174520	people do not know who I am do I still go out to this day yes because no one
1174520	1180680	will remember you you are a speck and all they care about is what happens in the
1180680	1191480	moment no one will say oh yeah do you remember that guy and that person in the
1191480	1198200	jeans wow they twitched once and I'm gonna remember that forever no no no they
1198200	1219960	will remember and I've been very conscious about that ever since
1221480	1240160	so I hope that helps in a way to help your self-confidence and self-esteem
1240160	1244640	issues because your confidence is self-esteem issues aren't gonna go
1244640	1255400	away that's or it's not gonna go away overnight what I personally practice is
1255400	1265000	that everyone when I was on stage doing theater doing stuff even even with
1265320	1274560	movies right I would be always blinded by the spotlight and when you're blinded
1274560	1279240	by the spot spotlight gets what you see nothing maybe you can see the most is
1279240	1293440	the outline shadow of someone but you cannot really see anything and that's
1293440	1300760	what I always think about when when I do something in public is that you know the
1300760	1306800	spotlight is blinding everyone I don't see anyone they're all gone there's only
1306800	1324080	just me and whatever thingy I'm doing right now so I know that it's a very
1324080	1332960	cringe story and I that was one accident but I'm sure that you being
1332960	1340440	hyper focused on whatever whatever you're doing is not gonna be as worse as
1340440	1342760	what I did
1353600	1358920	okay I passed back on
1362960	1375960	I'm actually in need of a shave and a haircut so I need my lovely Cole highs
1375960	1380920	input do you like your Senpai with a beard and what is your preferable hair
1380920	1389920	length I don't know what's comfortable with you Senpai my personal preference
1389920	1395680	for hair I know my hair is currently like pretty long right now but my personal
1395680	1405480	preference for hair is short because less shower time it's less shower time
1408480	1415080	it's less shower time it's more efficient you dry your hair so fast
1415080	1430520	saved on shampoo but if you like but all your preferences your own preference do
1430520	1435960	you like longer hair if that's what you like you and you like the you like to
1435960	1440680	take your time with your hair and take care of your hair that's all for you with
1440680	1448640	beards um I don't really have a preference on beard or not you know Senpai
1448640	1454120	Senpai's have been sending me a lot of questions on if I if I like beards beard
1454120	1459120	or not I think beards are fine I think mustaches are fine as long as you keep
1459120	1466640	them camped and well-maintained why because if you don't keep them nice and
1466680	1474080	clean and well-maintained kisses you're gonna get less kisses I'm sorry
1477080	1481800	you're gonna get less kisses
1486760	1495280	if there anything like the hair down there that I have and they come out real
1495280	1505120	prickly and polky when they grow back they go prickly and polky yeah I don't
1505120	1523720	want to kiss that so there you go Senpai you're wonderful
1525800	1538320	you're wonderful Cole hi has given you advice otherwise otherwise if you're so
1538320	1544880	tired of your hair laser it completely off that's what I did not my hair hair
1544880	1567520	but like my armpits I said not my hair hair like my pits they're
1567520	1583600	laser it took me a long time though I have a lot of hair I saved a lot of
1583600	1590920	money for that or go through the most painful thing ever which is an
1590920	1599280	epilator an epilator it's a device which functions as a hair removal and if you
1599280	1606160	use that your hair will will removal will last long will last longer but will
1606160	1610880	hurt like a bitch because essentially it's about a hundred me tweezers ripping
1610880	1622320	your hair out as once you can get one for your face just the pits how did it
1622320	1630400	feel at some parts it felt like there was like a little electric spark I was
1630400	1640840	like oh that's fine it's normal waxing not work Cole hi I'm kind of my skin's
1640840	1653240	really sensitive to the wax that's why I don't use it that's all it gets worse
1653240	1667160	every time okay next question let's say theoretically uh-huh I'm locked in a
1667160	1672520	cage and need to get out how do I do that asking for a Senpai
1683320	1691840	are you trying to get out Senpai are you trying to get out Senpai theoretically
1691840	1697360	no no no no no rhetorically asking for a friend that all means you that's all
1697360	1705320	you Senpai you are never leaving me understood there's no way out you are
1705320	1708480	stuck with me forever
1713840	1721880	forever and ever so there's no way out don't even try don't even try to ask
1721880	1730520	don't even try to pray you're here forever and you are mine and I fed you
1730520	1736280	and bathed you and given you all so many things that you could ever want I even
1736280	1744720	let you have your bionicles and you're you want to leave me
1748600	1756920	oh thank you thank you Misaka best I wanted to know if the bandage on your arm
1756920	1764080	goes all the way up to your armpit now I think it only I actually don't know I
1764240	1768400	think it only goes up to like the upper arm
1776760	1785720	so Senpai you will never leave me and that's final okay otherwise you'll be
1785760	1799320	asking for an Ex-Senpai an Ex-Senpai means that they're gone already okay okay
1799320	1802840	next question
1806880	1813400	hi mercy how do I fix my sleep schedule I'm basically nocturnal
1814160	1820640	oh thank you Miss Morrigan for the $1 you do theoretically I'm locked out of
1820640	1830600	the cage how do I get in this is a trick question um open the cage and get back
1830600	1836360	in done it walks from the outside
1837240	1846080	how do I fix my sleep schedule okay I'm going to assume this is if you are
1846080	1849880	watching me your sleep schedule is already fucked I'm sorry that's just how
1849880	1859600	it is the second question is the second point is if you are actually wanting to
1859600	1870800	fix your sleep schedule for like a job job or something what I did when I had
1870800	1880240	to wake up early mornings was that I wore myself out the the previous day
1880240	1886560	and then I was forced to fall asleep early be it exercise doing a bunch of
1886560	1894920	chores I'm going out for a hike wear yourself in and then you'll sleep like a

2665840	2674080	hi Mary see I have some questions that range from genuine to silly okay
2677400	2690400	is your hair naturally purple or is it dot hair die it's purple did you see my
2690400	2700240	lorry video it's purple it's naturally purple you have any advice for blocking
2700240	2709120	out noise during your recording um I have a couple of advice for blocking out
2709120	2717760	noises some of which you may already know I actually have a little closet room
2717760	2721760	for my recording which is kind of surrounded by clothes which dampen the
2721760	2728600	sound so it's pretty much I'm recording in a closet for an open space like this
2728600	2745000	one or like for my ASMR um I put my I have a senpai's have generously gifted
2745000	2750880	me a senpai has generously gifted me a weighted not a weighted blanket sorry a
2750880	2757040	sound damp dampening blanket well well why did I say waited it's not a weighted
2757040	2765480	one sound dampening blanket I hang over at the side also my space is by the PC
2765480	2775760	is has these town folks so that they can absorb the reverberations from the wall
2776200	2787240	mm-hmm if you have a lack of those another way to record your audio in
2787240	2793560	order to make the sound happening is to put a blanket over your head and the
2793560	2800880	microphone and the use of the blanket will also absorb outside noise and you
2800880	2805440	can just go be like blah blah blah blah here for example I'll even do it right
2805440	2812040	now you might not hear a difference okay let's go into the blanket together
2812040	2821960	senpai I draped blanket over and here you can hear there is no noise it's a
2821960	2834200	little bit more intimate but you can hear how everything's dampened right there
2834200	2851880	there that was just simply a blanket over the microphone
2864520	2873000	how do I do a good villain laugh a good villain laugh is to do with practice so
2873000	2880640	if you have but except for mine mine's kind of natural so if you have a good
2880640	2885480	villain laugh you can copy or try to imitate those that you have already
2885480	2912440	heard so some villain laughs that comes from upper the upper area back of your
2912440	2939840	throat in your chest that's kind of in your your throat pick one that suits you
2940200	2945120	and just go for it something that's calm comfortable and makes you just laugh
2945120	2948680	sometimes it sounds evil
2960120	2967040	what are some hurdles that prevent you from streaming full time well currently
2967520	2976320	this is kind of my full time but I will I will list some things that cause me some
2976320	2984280	up the bop bop bop bop bop bop bop give me a second I gotta I gotta mute for a
2984280	3000720	second sorry I had to let out a burp so I just muted okay aren't I so nice to be
3000720	3024360	so considerate anyways first hurdle that prevents me from full-time streaming is
3024360	3034520	living with my parents living with my parents they're upstairs right now making
3034520	3042360	gilsa they're making gilsa right now it's pretty loud I'm glad that is not
3042360	3064320	being picked up what kind of meat is it beef beef but essentially I have no
3064320	3069640	privacy the reason why I also stream at this time as well that I find ideal is
3069640	3078920	because Mama Papa kind of have no sense of personal space and boundaries because
3078920	3085280	I work online they kind of come in any time and just go can you handle this for
3085280	3095320	us right now and sometimes I'm just like I'm a little busy I'm a little busy the
3095320	3112560	type to open doors abruptly yep kind of yeah so um they're kind of the kind of
3112560	3118760	busy and it's kind of busy and so I don't have a lot of privacy and you know
3118760	3124760	Netflix tends to be more important than whatever I'm doing right now
3125760	3132920	oh it's my audio out already okay well I was I was told that okay they think that
3132920	3144960	mine was on Tuesdays now it looks like Mondays nevermind it's really funny oh by
3144960	3150840	the way my space has no doors the space that I'm currently in has no doors it's
3150840	3159800	kind of like an open space so that's why I do a lot of audio treatment stuff so
3159880	3169320	they just they can just like come down another one about hurdles that prevent
3169320	3175320	full-time streaming is well right now I'm doing full-time streaming but in order to
3175320	3186600	do it like as is there a particular way you keep them from coming in when you're
3186600	3194560	recording all it's all audios I'm in my closet I'm in my closet room so I'm
3194560	3197440	hidden from sight
3205080	3211560	another one would be just the cost because streaming streaming right away
3211720	3219800	does not always pay the bills it's a gradual thing that happens over time so
3219800	3226640	let's say you know your first month for example my first week right now would
3226640	3236120	that pay the bills right now and no you know if my second like maybe my second
3236120	3245360	week okay the the cost is is is going down because I'm getting more more money
3245360	3251840	in okay it's it's easier third week okay things are coming getting in more maybe
3251840	3262680	sec maybe fourth week maybe by fourth week maybe I have maybe I have have maybe
3262840	3273120	like enough to pay for bills I'll be real with you Senpai let's take off the
3273120	3280720	kayfabe for a second and I'll talk about my previous streaming streaming history
3280720	3289680	and I will tell you I will tell you some things I will tell you about splits and
3289680	3301400	stuff okay twitch splits is 50 50 okay 50 50 but it's the easiest and most
3301400	3307880	accessible thing and the quickest way to get monetized for YouTube monetization
3307880	3312280	you need you need and we're talking about only the first step of monetization
3312280	3321800	4,000 watch hours or 1 million short views plus 1000 no I think they changed
3321800	3329400	it 500 subscribers after that it goes through a manual review okay it takes a
3329400	3338960	long time as someone who is small and it doesn't help that if your videos even
3338960	3345400	though you're calculating yes I should have this many this many views to make
3345400	3350600	the 4,000 YouTube will not sometimes count it
3353520	3360920	let's see thank you for the $20 a nyanyi mesh it sounds like you need more
3361880	3369240	I want to work for for it though so I will I will be very truthful I will be
3369240	3377080	very truthful okay what is culling does that play into culling is when YouTube
3377080	3380680	believes that the following and subscribers are bots and they start
3380680	3388280	deleting them YouTube on the other hand I believe YouTube let me look it up first
3388280	3392040	so I don't give you wrong information
3392040	3394040	you
3409920	3421360	what's my revenue share blah blah blah okay shorts shorts are 45%
3422760	3429800	what's super chat
3439320	3443280	super chat is 7030
3443280	3459280	Super Chat is 7030.
3459280	3477280	Super chats are 7030 meaning YouTube will take 30%.
3477280	3505280	When I was full time streaming on Twitch, my old fans gave me $200.
3507280	3517280	I would get only $100 a month.
3517280	3537280	One time I had a birthday celebration.
3537280	3557280	I only got $250 in the end.
3557280	3577280	Now imagine this.
3577280	3587280	I would say this as a streamer.
3587280	3607280	If you don't get 500 subs,
3607280	3633280	you do not get the split.
3633280	3653280	If you get partner, your split is the same.
3653280	3673280	Unless you meet a certain threshold of subs, you do not get the split.
3673280	3693280	If you get money, you get nothing.
3693280	3713280	Most companies are with YouTube unless they have a deal.
3713280	3733280	This is public information and my own experience with it.
3733280	3753280	If you get monetization faster on Twitch, you might not even reach it on YouTube.
3753280	3763280	You might not be able to get partnership because it's very difficult.
3763280	3783280	If it's 4,000 watch hours, that's for one year.
3783280	3803280	It's a milestone to be a YouTube partner and monetize on YouTube.
3803280	3809280	I'm proud of what VLR has done.
3809280	3821280	Imagine I have the most seniority in terms of streaming.
3821280	3831280	In the three years of which I have been streaming as a VTuber, I have never gone monetization or even close to monetization on YouTube.
3831280	3841280	I did get monetization on Twitch though.
3841280	3851280	It's even harder to hit partner than to get monetized on YouTube.
3851280	3877280	Because you need a certain amount of hours streamed and hitting exactly or more than 78 average viewers.
3877280	3883280	That is a near impossible number or a number and that is not including rates.
3883280	3893280	You cannot have that number with rates, you cannot have that number with collabs, you cannot have that number with anything else.
3893280	3909280	Which is why, doesn't 78 average viewers put you on the top 1% of streamers? Wrong.
3909280	3921280	Senpai, you must know this. Just at 20 viewers, 20 average viewers, you are the top 1% of Twitch already.
3921280	3939280	For 78 viewers, you are the top 0.01%.
3939280	3949280	And that's how it is.
3949280	3963280	And that is what most of the hurdle is for streaming full time.
3963280	3975280	As for what is the best way to probably support me, Patreon is probably one of the best ways.
3975280	3985280	And YouTube membership slash YouTube super chats will be the least amount taken.
3985280	3991280	As well as tips as well, if you want to just donate through stream elements is probably the best.
3991280	3999280	Merch will be good as well.
3999280	4003280	So any little support is fine.
4003280	4011280	But those are the hurdles that prevent a lot of people from streaming full time.
4011280	4021280	To be honest, I don't know a lot of the networking what's better and what's better.
4021280	4027280	Because I just kind of stream, right?
4027280	4033280	And management takes care of all that stuff.
4033280	4045280	YouTube membership would probably be one of the good ways to support and super chats and Patreon and anything.
4045280	4049280	And if you can't afford any of that, just watching our streams is just fine as well.
4049280	4057280	Watching our streams, interacting, drawing fan art, anything to support the company is great.
4057280	4069280	It worked really hard and which is why hopefully everyone in VLOR can become full time streamers and just to entertain you.
4069280	4071280	Oh yeah, and clip as well.
4071280	4087280	If you clip, there's a chance that it will be probably edited by an editor and put into like shorts or a compilation.
4087280	4101280	You'll literally like comment hitting the bell. That is literally how you do it.
4101280	4103280	That's literally how you support.
4103280	4115280	But that is why there's a lot of people who have additional jobs or have something else to supplement the streaming.
4115280	4129280	Because of those hurdles.
4129280	4145280	And if I believe what I read about what YouTube gives as they're like how to grow your channel.
4145280	4151280	We are to believe that comments boost the algorithm for more eyes to be seen.
4151280	4163280	More subscribers also gives more eyes and a sense of trust as well as boosting your content.
4163280	4169280	And then likes and then they look at likes to two views.
4169280	4179280	So for example, if for example, I believe this is the case, I don't know how accurate it is because it's YouTube.
4179280	4187280	But comment on VOD specifically, it can be anything, it can be anything.
4187280	4201280	But if YouTube sees that you have tons of views, tons of views, but no likes or very little likes, they're like people hated that.
4201280	4205280	People hated that so we're not going to push it.
4205280	4209280	Kind of things like that.
4209280	4225280	I'm not fully aware of the mysteries of the YouTube algorithm because the real YouTube algorithm is a beast.
4225280	4241280	And if I knew how to abuse it, everyone would abuse it.
4241280	4245280	No, seriously, I have no idea how it works.
4245280	4263280	Same thing with Twitter. If I grew quite a bit on Twitter and I have no idea how I did it, I have no idea how I did it and I'm a little scared because I literally have no idea what I did.
4263280	4271280	So yeah.
4271280	4289280	So yeah, everything is really confusing and I don't really know, but I can tell you why there are some hurdles that prevent people from full time streaming is especially the splits, the splits, especially on Twitch.
4289280	4310280	If you're looking at your kind of like smaller indie Vtuber, that is most likely why they don't stream full time.
4310280	4333280	But I have no idea. I have no idea. Okay, and any recommendation for a good iPad. Find one that fits you and have a looser elastic because if the elastic pinches against your face, it's going to hurt and leave a little dent.
4333280	4359280	And you're going to be embarrassed so you never take your iPad off. Make sure the elastic is quite loose on you but still holding on.
4360280	4380280	Yeah, I had to wear an iPad because I got pink eye once in school and it was too tight and like the next day, the strap was still there.
4380280	4388280	The strap from the iPad was still there.
4388280	4396280	Yeah. Not because you were a tunie.
4396280	4407280	Well, part of it, I thought that looked cool, but also, yeah.
4407280	4415280	Yeah, I got pink eye once so now, so I know how it is.
4415280	4424280	So yeah, the pressure of the elastic or in cloth, if it's too tight, can be really painful.
4424280	4433280	But I think it looks cool.
4433280	4452280	Okay, next question. I hope that helped with some questions about, what's the word, why some people don't get full time streamer and for me it's that, oh, hold on, I didn't put my theme on.
4452280	4462280	Is it okay? I forgot to put on my theme. Ah, there we go.
4462280	4468280	Okay, okay. I forgot my BGM. That was my bad.
4468280	4472280	My precious Kohai, thank you for being you, Senpai's.
4472280	4479280	Days are happier when you're in them. I hope you're being as kind to yourself as you are Senpai.
4479280	4489280	Oops. Oops, that's my bad. This was a compliment that got shifted in. That shifted in. That was my, that was my pad.
4489280	4499280	Oops, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But thank you. Thank you, Senpai. I accidentally saved this into the list. That was definitely my bad, but I really appreciated.
4499280	4511280	I'm kind of hard on myself, Senpai. I'm kind of hard on myself, but I'll do my best to be prouder of myself in my achievements.
4511280	4518280	Thank you. Very good advice.
4518280	4533280	This was actually truly an accident that this slipped in. I was trying to save a bunch of advice questions, but I think I accidentally saved this one, but thank you. I really appreciate it.
4533280	4542280	I'm tired. Come next to me so we can cuddle. Wait, what is this also?
4543280	4554280	I need to review these questions. I need to review these. Why did some of the ones that are not questions mixed in?
4554280	4566280	Yes, we can cuddle.
4567280	4574280	I'm so scared. I'm so scared. What the next one's going to be?
4574280	4578280	Okay.
4579280	4591280	My coworker goals on 4chan is insensitive and may or may not have a crush on me. Do I extort him or reject him? Serious answers only.
4591280	4600280	You take his phone number and you put it in a bathroom stall and then you say, hey, great time here. And then you order 70 pizzas to their location.
4600280	4624280	Different from different companies and make them fight each other, but also extortion 100%.
4624280	4629280	I don't think that's legal, Kohai.
4629280	4650280	What did I write in my thing? All advice are for jokes and giggles and hee hee ha ha. Please do not take them seriously. All advice takers are responsible for their own actions, regardless of what advice has been given. You're welcome.
4654280	4681280	I don't actually know. To be honest, I don't actually, it's like, wow, you really hate 4chan users. I don't hate 4chan users. I just don't have a great trust in the form.
4681280	4697280	Are they called forms? I don't use this site, but I do have occasionally my friends, my gal pals and my friends will go on and they'll be like, okay, let's see what people are saying about you.
4697280	4722280	And I'll leave the nasty icky stuff away. And yeah. So I don't actually go on there. I have my friends. Occasionally, some people might give advice, but I rather not go on there since I'm a sensitive little baby.
4722280	4732280	But yeah, he's all in shits and giggles, you know? Next.
4732280	4750280	It's probably like Reddit. And guess what? I don't go on Reddit either, except for, um, what's the word? I don't go on Reddit either, except for like, um, for example, I'm like, oh, how, for like tech advice, how do I make my lights go on?
4751280	4763280	Does that make sense?
4763280	4776280	So I look if it's like, so it's either tech people on YouTube or tech people on Reddit. They're very good.
4776280	4793280	So yeah, that's, um, that's the thing. Okay, I hope this isn't too personal, but when you draw blow bubbles, okay, okay, I haven't blown bubbles in a long time.
4793280	4806280	Do you watch the bubbles fall to the ground and think about how falling bubbles are like a metaphor for beauty and fragility of life as you said shed a single tear or do you be popping all of them bubbles?
4806280	4818280	Um, I kind of pop all of them. I pop all the bubbles or I let them let them float off and see where they go. And that's it.
4819280	4834280	No, seriously, I don't think too much on it because bubbles are just like us. Not a permanent thing in life. You're welcome.
4835280	4858280	You blow them like, you know, from the bubbles or or you can like wave the wand, the like wand and then it makes bubbles too.
4858280	4869280	This isn't really a question, is it? It must have gone mixed in. This is not really like, uh, this isn't really like a advice thing.
4869280	4880280	I slipped in. Oops. I swear I went through them and I guess some stuff slipped in. Don't let me do this when I'm like super tired.
4889280	4897280	Free Q&A. Okay, let's break kayfabe for a brief second. All right. All right. I've had a kami oh she for two plus years.
4897280	4911280	Okay, okay. Don't break. Don't break. Don't break. And I'm very dedicated to her. She has got me through some extremely rough times and I owe her a bigger depth than I could, could hope to ever pay back.
4911280	4916280	Unfortunately, her streaming times barely line up with my work schedule anymore.
4916280	4921280	Recently, I discovered you. I really enjoy your general vibe and sense of humor.
4921280	4937280	I appreciate the entire experience and am really drawn to your choice of games. Simply put, I genuinely enjoy you for entirely different reasons and have rarely clicked with a creator so quickly in my four plus years in VTuber rabbit hole.
4938280	4946280	So my conundrum is this. I know that I'm not portraying my kami oh she by watching and enjoying you but deep down it feels like as though I am.
4946280	4954280	How do you suggest I resolve this internal struggle without giving up either of you? Apologies that this is too heavy or real of a question.
4954280	4960280	I hope I loved your take today. I love your take on this. Thank you. Much love.
4960280	4965280	Ugh, Petrina, what you eating is bad. But, okay, okay, okay.
4965280	4969280	Ignoring the fact that I want to be the favorite here.
4969280	4972280	Ignoring the fact that I want to be the favorite here.
4974280	4976280	And that it should only be me.
4979280	4982280	Let me get my friend. Let me get my friend.
4984280	4986280	Let me get my friend and title.
4986280	4988280	Let me get my friend and title.
4994280	4996280	Oh no, another question.
4998280	5000280	Another question on this.
5001280	5004280	Wow, I think you guys are making mercy.
5004280	5006280	Neat.
5015280	5017280	I think you are making mercy. Neat.
5023280	5025280	You snitched on me. Neat.
5025280	5028280	Last time maybe you shouldn't have been a little bitch.
5029280	5037280	Anyway, let's talk about Ostees.
5044280	5049280	Ostees are your number one, your favorite things in idol culture.
5049280	5056280	But anyways, like all things change. And sometimes you have to accept that.
5056280	5060280	And as all creatures, we have to accept it as well.
5064280	5072280	One example, in your life, sometimes, are you always friends with your best friends?
5072280	5079280	Perhaps over time, your best friend and you will grow my distance on your part.
5079280	5082280	And that is just a fact of life.
5093280	5095280	Change is happening in your life.
5096280	5099280	Things, for example, when chips may die,
5099280	5101280	and others will begin.
5102280	5108280	So please do not feel you are completely indebted and into complete loyalty.
5109280	5115280	Because as your Oshi, your Oshi will also view changes.
5115280	5119280	And view ish, and also in yourself.
5119280	5126280	And you too will also view new new Ostees all the time.
5126280	5131280	And you may move on, and that is just the way of idols.
5131280	5136280	It is unfortunate, but it is a thing that happens.
5140280	5144280	For example, if you have a friend or a partner,
5144280	5149280	and your Oshi may graduate,
5149280	5157280	and you can keep your Oshi in your heart forever, forever.
5162280	5170280	But if, for example, you find that your Oshi has pivoted
5171280	5177280	different genres that you do not, that you do not vibe with,
5177280	5181280	and perhaps it is time to move on from an Oshi,
5181280	5185280	and take them for their time that they have spent with you.
5185280	5189280	But perhaps it is time for both you and them to go on.
5189280	5205280	Well, I believe that if you believe that you are between your Oshi,
5205280	5208280	then you can continue to watch your Oshi.
5208280	5214280	But remember that your Oshi can go through changes,
5214280	5219280	and that changes sometimes means having to say goodbye.
5222280	5225280	Now I will bring back Mashi.
5245280	5251280	Oops, where the heck is my window? There it is.
5251280	5255280	I hope, yeah, I had time to cool off. I had time to cool off.
5260280	5266280	I had time to cool off, so now, so now, I hope you got your answered question.
5266280	5269280	I hope your question got answered.
5275280	5278280	Yeah, I found a magical cat.
5278280	5285280	I found a magical cat just the other day, and then we became besties.
5285280	5288280	I feel like a magical girl.
5293280	5296280	Okay, here's the next question.
5297280	5299280	Ugh.
5301280	5306280	Do your parents know? No, it's a secret, okay? You keep it a secret, right?
5312280	5316280	Dear Mercy, I need life advice on two things.
5316280	5319280	One, I'd like to build Gunpla, so for my next project,
5319280	5322280	should I do two small models or one big model?
5322280	5325280	And two, what should I have for lunch tomorrow?
5325280	5331280	If you don't, don't, don't answer, I will starve instead. Love you, SMPI.
5331280	5332280	Wow.
5333280	5334280	Okay.
5337280	5345280	Personally, I feel like doing maybe two smaller models will be easier than doing one big model.
5345280	5356280	And for lunch, have Gyoza, I guess?
5356280	5364280	I'm out of food thoughts because Mama, Mama Mercy is making Gyoza.
5367280	5370280	And I guess you're going to have Gyoza, too.
5376280	5384280	It's empty, only Gyoza. You don't understand. The smell of the Gyoza is really good.
5384280	5387280	It's really good, SMPI.
5392280	5394280	Where do I find Gyoza?
5394280	5399280	Oh, check any, check any like place.
5399280	5401280	Oh, what's another alternative name for Gyoza?
5401280	5403280	You can find it at like Chinese places, too.
5403280	5407280	Dumplings, right? Or pot stickies.
5407280	5414280	They're also called pot stickies, or meat dumplings, or just dumplings.
5414280	5418280	You can probably find them at like a Chinese restaurant.
5418280	5423280	Or if there's like a specialty Japanese place, you can get like the Gyoza.
5423280	5425280	Or you can make it.
5426280	5437280	Also Walmart, and I think like most grocery stores have like some instant one as well.
5441280	5446280	So yeah, there you go. Thank you, SMPI, for sending it in.
5446280	5458280	How'd I get a girlfriend and am I a good SMPI? You're already, I'm already your girlfriend, SMPI.
5458280	5465280	And yes, you are a good SMPI, as long as you're not a troll, or like someone who's pretending to be a SMPI.
5466280	5468280	You're welcome.
5469280	5480280	What is the airspeed velocity of an unlaid and swallow? European or African? Or even Asian?
5489280	5491280	Next question.
5492280	5500280	What is the minimum of cleaning products that I should use in the shower? Should I keep sticking to three in one shampoo? I will fucking kill you.
5500280	5520280	First of all, for, I'm assuming if it's a three in one, this is a question for from a male SMPI.
5520280	5545280	I'm assuming four male SMPIs. I highly recommend body wash one, two shampoo, three conditioner, and a face wash.
5545280	5547280	In total, you will have four products.
5554280	5566280	What's one, what's wrong with three in ones? The reason why three in ones do not work is because your scalp skin and your skin skin are completely different.
5567280	5577280	So if you use your body wash, it may be too harsh on your scalp, or it might be too light on your skin. Simple.
5581280	5583280	It's very simple, really.
5584280	5594280	That's three products too many. Then don't take my advice and die. And be disliked by.
5594280	5620280	About two in ones. I still don't recommend two in ones. I still don't recommend two in ones. If you want, if you want, I will give you some picks, because I helped Papa Mercy pick some products.
5624280	5630280	It's very cheap. It's very cheap to get, to get shampoo and conditioner. Whatever works for you.
5634280	5643280	Okay, whatever works for you, whatever your hair issue is, if you get a lot of dandruff, use a dandruff shampoo and use a matching, the matching conditioner with it.
5644280	5652280	The shampoo strips, the, okay, shampoo strips conditioner brings back the moisture, understood?
5658280	5670280	Because if you just use shampoo, it will dry out your hair. It will dry out your hair, which is great if you are a very oily person, if you're an oily person, maybe just stripping is all you need.
5674280	5690280	Second, second is the conditioner. Conditioner, if you find that your hair is too dry or your scalp is beginning to flay, not, I wouldn't recommend putting it on your scalp, but for males, yes, I would probably recommend putting it on your scalp.
5690280	5694280	If you find your scalp is flaking too much, try a conditioner with it.
5695280	5714280	Next is a body wash. A body wash will help you strip, strip yourself. Actually, I recommend five products. Sorry. We'll strip a dead skin cell off of dead skin cells and basically sweat and stuff.
5714280	5729280	It's very cheap. I believe the best soap you can buy is like a dove bar. A dove bar will help with a bit of adding a bit of moisture as well.
5729280	5742280	But if you're super manly and you can't stand the girly dove stuff, I recommend an Irish spring bar soap.
5745280	5762280	Second is a face wash because your face is not the same as your skin. Your face has a different type of texture and sensitivity. It has more pores and there's delicate areas around your face and eyes.
5762280	5788280	So you need a face wash. I recommend, um, I recommend, uh, there was, I found out the body shop was shutting down. I would have recommended you the seaweed wash from, um,
5789280	5800280	from, from, uh, the body shop, but it's no longer there. So, uh, there's a, give me a second, give me a second. There's another brand that I really like.
5800280	5814280	I think this is great for men as well because I feel like it is, uh, it is a wash that a strip that makes you less shiny and helps clears out your pores and makes you feel nice and clean.
5814280	5829280	So the, um, wash was avenue, avenue, avenue, avenue, a wash.
5830280	5852280	It is a huge little thing is bath and body works a good place. Now, bath and body works, I think, uh, sucks, sucks, except for their sense. Uh, it sucks. Uh, so this one's called, excuse my French, it's going to be terrible.
5853280	5865280	But, um, avenue, cleanance, cleansing gel. This is great. It's a huge bottle. It will last you forever. You can buy it for like super cheap.
5865280	5894280	Um, and I recommend a lotion for men. After your shower, put on some lotion. It will make you feel good and it will keep bringing back some moisture into the skin that you have already, um,
5894280	5907280	gotten rid of. So, uh, simple lotion that most people use will be a Vaseline lotion.
5907280	5930280	So I use their cocoa, cocoa radiant. Uh, but you can use anything is fine. You can use, uh, like the aloe vera hydration, advanced repair, whatever, just bring back some moisture in your skin.
5930280	5951280	And that's it. That is Mercy Modisse. How to, uh, how to get bitches. Tea tree shampoo is good. What about Walmart? Walmart is, you can find all these products at Walmart.
5951280	5967280	Where does the lotion go? Arms, legs, chest, back, if you can reach. You can buy all these products at Walmart. I am not lying to you. Like all these products can be like maybe a dollar.
5967280	5988280	So the most you might spend is like, if you use my recommendation, it's going to be a little bit more expensive for the face wash. But if you get a regular face wash at whatever is at, uh, at Walmart, then maybe your five products can be $5.
5988280	6002280	There's no Walmart in Europe. Uh, in that case, go to a, where do they sell skincare in Europe? Pharmacy? I think they might sell them at pharmacy. Hmm.
6018280	6047280	I feel like, even if you aren't going to get ladies, I feel like you are going to have, you're going to feel very, you're going to feel much better. You're going to feel much better after you take a shower and you're going to feel like, what?
6048280	6077280	Oh, I feel good. Where does short hair need conditioner? I said you don't have to use conditioner. Um, but if it's your scalp does, if your scalp does have like really bad, um, if you really have like bad dandruff or you're finding yourself like, um, like you might have like
6077280	6104280	super flakiness or dryness in your hair, uh, try a conditioner. It's, it's, it's, um, it's not needed. I technically don't really use conditioner. I use conditioner sometimes. In fact, I, instead of a shaving cream, instead of a shaving cream, if I shave, I just use conditioner because it softens the hair anyways and it's easy to shave.
6104280	6130280	You can save your, save money using conditioner as well. I use conditioner and my hair is still dry. Try a different conditioner. I don't know what type you're using.
6130280	6150280	Okay. And I will like you a lot if you try these because I want my supplies to feel confident and or maybe too much shampoo. Uh, shampoo in your hand should be only like, I think for men only about, well, I can't use that reference because then that doesn't have it.
6150280	6177280	Um, a dollop, just like, just in the middle of your palm. So that should be enough. I think, um, if you, honestly, it's really easy to save on these type of things. And I feel like for guys, they tend to have less sensitive skin.
6177280	6194280	And the most problems I think for guys skin, if I can recall, is just oiliness. So it's easy to do like that.
6194280	6215280	And soapy use instead of body wash soap, soap and body wash will be used intermittently. So for example, a bar soap will be just fine to use as a body soap. So like I said, Irish spring or a dove, I highly recommend dove body bar.
6215280	6239280	Because it brings some moisture back, but also helps get rid of the, um, the, um, the dead skin, the dead skin and sweat. And long thick hair adult doesn't cut it. Uh, if you have long thick hair, um, a palm full will be fine, a palm full will be fine.
6239280	6258280	But also for long thick hair, I highly recommend, um, cause, uh, Tressame, the brand Tressame.
6258280	6270280	Irish spring makes my skin feels waxy. Try a dove bar then. I, I highly recommend the dove bar more than the Irish spring bar.
6270280	6282280	I use Tressame myself. And I will tell you, um, my hair, I know it doesn't look like this cause my hair is pretty thin at the edges here, like paper thin.
6282280	6301280	But my hair is actually, uh, really thick. It used to be as thick as barbed wire. And I switched to a clarifying shampoo, um, because it gets pretty oily. And it, it, uh, helped quite a bit.
6302280	6320280	It used to be as thick as barbed wire. Like it got really bad. So, uh, so, uh, I actually went to a salon and asked the salon, um, my hair person to be like, what the fuck do I do, man? This is torturing me.
6320280	6332280	Um, they were like, okay, what brand have you been using? And then I was like, okay, I've been using this brand, this brand, and this brand. And they were like, no, that's no good.
6332280	6355280	And I said, uh, for a direct store brand, try Tressame. And I said, okay. And I said, okay. And so I used, uh, just, I used just the Tressame shampoo. Lately, I've been seeing that my hair has actually gotten dry at the ends.
6355280	6384280	So, so I used, um, so I ended up using, um, a, what do you call it? I ended up using conditioner. I ended up using a conditioner. That's, I think it's apple cider and apple cider conditioner to help with the oiliness as well.
6385280	6405280	Um, I use Tressame and then for my oily hair, I also, I also have to blow dry it at the blow dry my hair. It's so long, but it can get really greasy. So the blow dry will also make it dry out a little bit more.
6406280	6408280	So that's what I use for my hair.
6415280	6429280	But yeah, experiment with things. If you're fine, listen, if you, if you're fine, if you're fine with using your three in one, fine, just use your three in one. Okay.
6431280	6441280	It doesn't matter. It doesn't really matter. It's your choice. I don't, I don't force your hand. Well, I do force your hand sometimes, but but really it's your choice.
6441280	6459280	It's your choice, but if you like cleaner hair, if you want to feel your skin immaculate and stuff, and you want to feel more moisture, I recommend five steps.
6460280	6471280	I recommend the five steps, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair, not fair hair, face wash, lotion, that's it.
6472280	6490280	I do admit I hate three in ones because I admit I hate three in ones because your scalp, your face, and your body does not have the same chemistry.
6490280	6501280	Yeah, you can still use it. I just, I'll silently judge you. Next question.
6502280	6514280	What's the proper way to prepare your cereal? Some believe you should pour cereal into the bowl first. Others believe that pouring milk first is the best method.
6514280	6536280	Thoughts, please help me. I'm really hungry. Milk first. No, seriously, it's milk first. It's milk first. Milk first so your cereal doesn't get soggy. You can take your time eating it.
6544280	6573280	Well, if you want it soggy, then put cereal first. But I don't like soggy cereal, so I actually, what I do is I put the milk in first and then I take my Pikachu spoon because it makes me feel like I'm still youthful and still watching cartoons as I eat my cereal.
6574280	6583280	I put, I like pour, I might even pour sometimes like one spoonful at a time because I don't like how soggy it gets.
6583280	6608280	Anyways, people always say, why do you take so long? Well, I'm telling you, sometimes they're stuck at the bottom and it gets soggy.
6609280	6620280	Or you can eat the cereal and then, yeah, you can eat the cereal and then take a sip of milk. Easy.
6620280	6649280	There you go. Next question. Wow, people are cancelling me just for that. So many people are saying that.
6651280	6656280	How many days acceptable to be wearing the same underwear? Keep in mind, I don't sweat much.
6656280	6665280	As long as you want and it doesn't, guess what? Underwear doesn't disintegrate. So you can keep wearing it as long as you can stand it.
6665280	6689280	If you can smell your balls or your cooch, then maybe it's time to wash.
6689280	6707280	There you go. What's the longest you've gone, Mercy? It's embarrassing, but I've gone a month without showering.
6707280	6732280	I was very depressed. I was very depressed at that time. Please tell me you're lying. No.
6737280	6748280	That was probably the most depressed I've ever, I was ever.
6748280	6768280	But I ended up, the most I go now is probably a week and that's it. That's actually kind of the norm.
6778280	6793280	When was your last shower? Three days ago. We're still good.
6793280	6819280	We're still good. I don't sweat that much either. I don't sweat that much. I think the water's back on, I think. Yeah, we're good.
6819280	6835280	You're schooling us on showers? I use a lot, okay? I school you on shower because I care about you, Senpai. But even if I don't shower for a week, my skin is still perfect, my hair is still perfect.
6835280	6850280	I'm just saying, it's still perfect. I'm still perfect.
6850280	6873280	My hair still looks like I got out of a salon, okay?
6873280	6889280	Simple. That's because it's stiff. It's not stiff. It's super soft. If you give me pets daily, Senpai, you would understand how soft it is.
6889280	6918280	Do you know how long it took me? I just told you, my hair used to be barbed wire. My hair used to be barbed wire, and then I just found the perfect thing.
6920280	6936280	Anyways, next question. Can't decide what should be the name of my cat. My current cat is named Catherine, or just cat for short, and she needs a pal, so I was thinking of adopting a new cat.
6936280	6965280	You named your cat cat? You named your cat cat? Catherine with a C, sure. We can play Catherine like the game.
6966280	6992280	You're going to name your cat cat? Kitty? You're going to have cat and kitty. This reminds me of a post I saw about families be naming their kid Rex, but their dog Joseph.
6996280	7025280	Well, you have tons of names to choose, but if your cat's name is cat, you can try your other cat to be kitty.
7027280	7037280	No, I'm serious, maybe.
7037280	7058280	I mean, like if it's already Catherine, kitty is already like Catherine with a C, so I guess kitty is still the same thing.
7058280	7065280	Name it cat, like cat cat? Okay, that's kind of cute. Actually, that's cute. That's cute, sure.
7066280	7077280	Kit and cat, what do you think? I think that's fine.
7078280	7093280	Yeah, kit, kit and cat, right? So it's like, if you say kit cat together, and then they're like, yeah, that's, that's cute, right? I feel like that was a good name. Whoever suggested that? Yeah, let's go with that. You name your next cat kit.
7094280	7111280	Coffee or green tea? I prefer green tea.
7112280	7131280	I prefer green tea. I don't like drinking coffee. I think it tastes, doesn't taste great. It's too bitter, but I like green tea. Coffee! Any tea tonight? Oh, yeah, I did. Oh, shoot, I don't remember what tea I made, though.
7131280	7150280	I don't like the taste of, I don't like the taste of coffee, unless it's like extra sweet, and it can barely be called coffee. Like, I guess.
7151280	7161280	No, wait, hold on, let me sniff it. It's apple cinnamon again. The tea I have is apple cinnamon again.
7161280	7177280	Why are we at an English word of the day? Conundrum. Conundrum. Why the conundrum?
7177280	7193280	So, for example, the most coffee, I think, I think most empires figured out, figured out that I'm Canadian. Okay, so the only other coffee I like is an ice cap from Tim Hortons.
7208280	7216280	Yep, sorry.
7216280	7230280	So, yeah, I don't like coffee. I don't like coffee.
7230280	7250280	I think most empires figured it out really, really easily. Why are all VTubers Canadian? I don't know. I don't know. Like, literally, I don't know.
7250280	7274280	I don't know. I just wanted to be here and with my senpais, and I'm going to just guess everyone else stole my idea.
7274280	7289280	That's it. Yeah. So, it doesn't really matter. I think everyone else just stole my idea.
7289280	7303280	Tea is, I like tea better. I will drink nothing but tea. I don't put anything in my tea. I think the flavor is fine as it is.
7303280	7317280	The apple cinnamon tea? I didn't get it from Tim Hortons. I have it from a brand called Stash.
7317280	7324280	Does that mean we get Tim Hortons once a month too? Everyone fights for the Timbits? I'm kind of allergic too, so.
7324280	7333280	Snash? No, it's Stash. Stash, S-T-A-S-H.
7333280	7343280	Hi, since you're Canadian, what's your Tim's order? Ice cap with a whole wheat bagel and cream cheese.
7343280	7367280	Sometimes, if I'm feeling a little frisky, I'll ask for a Boston cream.
7367280	7376280	Actually, Tim Hortons donuts are the only donuts I can eat. I can eat their yeast donuts because they don't contain eggs.
7376280	7385280	But if they're cake donuts, if they have cake donuts, I cannot eat them. Which is why I can't have Timbits because all the Timbits are made together.
7385280	7408280	So the Timbits are kind of all mixed in, so I can't have Timbits.
7408280	7419280	Intaminated with eggs? Yeah. There's a high chance that I always ask for the ones that are the furthest from touching other donuts.
7419280	7425280	If there's a donut that's touching another one, I try to avoid that donut.
7425280	7433280	So sometimes I'll get like a maple cream one instead of Boston cream if the Boston cream is too close to the cake donuts.
7433280	7445280	Or I ask them to use a different tong.
7445280	7460280	I like Poutine. I do like Poutine. And small amounts. I'm not like a huge Poutine person.
7460280	7466280	So yeah.
7466280	7470280	I like Poutine. I do.
7470280	7477280	Next question. How can I be more confident around others?
7477280	7485280	Develop your ego so far beyond people that nothing can faze you.
7485280	7496280	What's Poutine? It is a Canadian specialty. It is essentially fries or chips in other countries.
7496280	7519280	I like the UK or Australia, we call them chips, with cheese curds and gravy. It is kind of like street food.
7519280	7535280	Yes, remember my story as well. But essentially, how do you become confident around others?
7535280	7544280	It's a thing to work on. It's a thing to work on. I can tell you my confidence got smushed to heck.
7544280	7565280	But when I was a very confident girl, I just always told myself that I was the best.
7565280	7571280	I was the best. People will love me. If they don't love me, they're weird.
7571280	7580280	And then I got my ass kicked. By ass kicked, I mean like I got Meadow Illinois.
7580280	7588280	Sounds like a mess. You don't eat it with your hands. You eat it with like a fork.
7588280	7600280	I like regular fries for Poutine. You are the best though. I still wish I had that confidence I had back then.
7600280	7611280	I lost it because of some stuff. I am a really shy person. I have trouble talking with others. I haven't made any new friends in a year.
7611280	7625280	Would you have any advice on how I can? I feel like my senpais have very similar problems.
7625280	7631280	I feel like my senpais have very similar problems.
7632280	7648280	Okay, this is going to sound bad. But the best way to talk to someone and to be a good listener is to act.
7648280	7656280	This is stealing from a book. This is stealing from a book called How to Win Friends and Influence People.
7657280	7672280	Listen carefully to what people say. Respond to what they say. Oh, to interest in what they're talking about.
7672280	7679280	And do stuff. Try on error. This is going to take a lot of confidence.
7679280	7688280	But next time you go out to an event, look to the next person next to you and be like, hi, my name is Blank. Nice to meet you.
7688280	7696280	I'm really looking forward to whatever event you're at.
7696280	7706280	It's going to be a lot of work. Our submission is closed. I have quite a few to go through as well.
7706280	7725280	Honestly, if you can make friends online, you can make friends in real life.
7725280	7731280	I actually have trouble making friends online than I can in real life, I guess.
7731280	7743280	The first step is hardest. If you go to a convention, if you want to talk to someone and maybe you don't have a topic to talk about,
7743280	7748280	be like, hey, I don't know if you're at a convention.
7748280	7755280	Hey, I noticed you have this on your phone. Do you like this character?
7755280	7764280	And if it's just a simple thing, if they don't seem like they want to talk to you, just be like, oh, okay, well, I have something to do now.
7764280	7772280	At your round sometime. Bye. Get out of there.
7772280	7788280	Get out of there.
7788280	7794280	Get out of there. But if you are interested in meeting people, show genuine interest in the other person.
7794280	7804280	Don't just be like, me, me, me, me, so show genuine interest in the other person and be like, oh yeah, I'd like, oh yeah, let's chat more.
7804280	7811280	Oh my gosh. Hope to see you again soon. And if you want, you can be like, oh yeah, do you have like a discord?
7811280	7818280	But don't be like, don't be. Last time I went to a convention, don't be the guy who's like, where do you live?
7818280	7826280	What hotel are you staying at? Where are you going to eat tonight? What's your room number? Okay.
7826280	7842280	That is, don't be like that. Don't be like that.
7842280	7857280	So don't be like that because you're unlikely to get like, oh, do you use discord? I'd love to keep in contact.
7857280	7879280	Okay. Our coal high gets hit on a lot. It's the way I dressed.
7879280	7888280	How do you dress like this? Like this, duh.
7888280	7908280	Or I, or honestly, I just like, any upcoming cons? No, I'm not a con person anymore. I've become, what do you call it?
7909280	7916280	I've become, do you have a VLR sensor? IRL? Yeah, yeah, I do.
7916280	7927280	Um, yeah, I just walk around with this, with this giant pair of scissors in my hair and the VLR logo. That's how I look.
7927280	7933280	I become a Shedden. Yeah, a recluse, a Shedden. So I don't go to cons. I don't feel comfortable with going to cons.
7933280	7952280	And I am now having the new worry if, even if I'm like, even if I do go to a con, there is no percentage higher chance, a percentage of a higher chance.
7952280	7962280	And I'll be recognized just by my voice alone.
7962280	7971280	No, I'm serious. That's something that I'm actually scared of.
7971280	7991280	Because my entire life has been, has been, has been, oh my gosh, I found you at this convention or I found you at this place because I heard you laugh.
7992280	8011280	Or, oh my gosh, I found you because I heard you, you, your voice.
8011280	8023280	So, um, and the thing is I'm a giggler. I'm a laffer. I'll, I just laugh.
8023280	8034280	And, uh, I laugh a lot. So it's too noticeable.
8034280	8049280	Yeah, I, I, I am, was, I'm not good with people in real life anymore. Honestly, I'm not good with real people anymore.
8049280	8057280	I may be an extrovert. So I'm just like, huh. So I, I had a nightmare, like a couple of nights ago, I was like, I was at a con.
8057280	8066280	And then I, I was like, oh, that's so cute. Like a, like a, at a booth. And then someone turned around and was like, Mercy, Moe, Deast.
8066280	8075280	And I go, and I woke up.
8075280	8085280	See, the thing is that it wouldn't be much of a problem, but I am a traditionalist and I don't want people knowing me.
8085280	8100280	You know, I don't want people knowing me. I don't like, I don't like it when people figure it out.
8100280	8108280	And I definitely, definitely, definitely don't get me wrong.
8108280	8124280	I trust Senpai's, a lot of my Senpai's, but there are a lot of people with malicious intent. So for example, um, if someone find out, find out who I am, maybe they'll take a picture of me from a distance and then post it all over online.
8124280	8132280	And then I get mean comments and then I'm crying and then, you know,
8132280	8154280	or if, you know, it could be even worse. Like for example, they might follow me home and I still have my parents to think about, you know.
8154280	8160280	And like, you know, yeah.
8160280	8185280	If, if there is a chance, if there is an off chance, if there is an off chance that perhaps we do meet IRL by accident or a coincidence, I ask my Senpai's to keep it to themselves.
8185280	8200280	Keep it to themselves as our little, little secret.
8200280	8208280	Okay, what about a very handsome man? If I met a very handsome man, um, I still don't trust it.
8208280	8215280	I've had the re, okay, I'll be real with my Senpai's for a second.
8215280	8233280	The reason why I have trust issues and the reason why I have mental Illinois is because I used to have a friend who I thought was my friend, but they were really, they tried to ruin my life.
8233280	8253280	And I didn't know, but the entire time they were like talking behind my back and stuff. So I cannot trust anyone now.
8253280	8274280	So I cannot trust anyone. Which is why, um, which is why I have trouble trusting if, even if you do have the, the sweetest intent.
8274280	8279280	Did you write a tweet longer? No, I had the tweet longer written about me.
8279280	8294280	And I did not do anything. It wasn't a tweet longer. It was like a Facebook thing, which is why I quit Facebook too.
8294280	8304280	Um, no, I think they were just using me as like a scapegoat.
8304280	8311280	I think they were using me as a scapegoat.
8311280	8322280	Because, um, they, they spread a lot of lies about me. And then I got like constantly harassed.
8322280	8337280	So which is why, um, I tend to, tend to keep things to myself. Okay, sometimes.
8337280	8347280	So yeah, I tried to keep things to myself. So, uh, when, when the whole thing happened, I was, I was like in the middle of exams.
8347280	8356280	So I didn't know it was happening until like when I went outside to a convention, someone spit on me and like called me names.
8356280	8376280	And I didn't know what was happening until that happened. And then I was like, hated. And then it took years, but people found out that that person was spreading lies.
8376280	8392280	So yeah, I have trust issues. So even if like someone who's super, super, super nice comes up to me, I cannot.
8392280	8400280	I cannot trust them.
8400280	8411280	It took years for me to like open up again.
8411280	8429280	It took me years to open up again, which is why I have a bit of trust issues. And which is why I do have very close friends, but never, you know, I do have very close friends, but I don't make more friends than that.
8429280	8439280	I have my Ryder die friends and not more, much more than that.
8439280	8449280	That's it. And my Ryder die friends are my gen mates, some, some IRL friends.
8449280	8455280	And, and of course,
8455280	8461280	Serenity.
8461280	8467280	And of course, some other friends, online friends.
8467280	8471280	Yeah.
8471280	8478280	So yeah, that's why I'm just like, keep it a secret, but also I won't trust you.
8478280	8485280	And that's why I don't trust you and you always stay in that cage.
8485280	8491280	Next question.
8492280	8502280	Should I get this limited edition skin for a gacha character or feed myself for three days, feed yourself for three days, because if you're looking at a different character and with lustful eyes, and it's not me, I'm going to be very jealous.
8502280	8511280	Okay, next question.
8511280	8515280	No, no, why are you saying get the skin? No, no, no.
8515280	8526280	You're going to look at the skin with lustful, lustful gaze and I'm right there.
8526280	8543280	No, no, no, no, the game you're playing is free to play. Use your, use your free currency. Don't use real cash.
8543280	8554280	Don't use real cash.
8554280	8563280	No, no, it's free to play. It's free to play.
8563280	8566280	It's free to play.
8567280	8570280	Do your dailies.
8570280	8575280	But it's a limited skin. Well, maybe you should have just saved up for the limited skin.
8575280	8585280	Huh?
8585280	8589280	Oh my gosh.
8589280	8593280	Get the food.
8593280	8599280	The limited skins are only pay to win. You can admire it in a distance. That's fine.
8599280	8607280	I'd rather, I'd rather eat my own foot than pay for, pay for a gacha game.
8607280	8613280	And I've already gotten, gotten everyone I wanted in like, Nikkei.
8613280	8628280	Get your food stocks, I guess. Yeah, you can get the skin.
8628280	8632280	Ah.
8632280	8636280	Thank you Anonymous for 20. The limited skin.
8636280	8639280	It's Yukohai.
8639280	8647280	Is she? It's me? It's me?
8647280	8651280	Oh, thank you.
8651280	8674280	Thank you Anonymous.
8674280	8680280	The rest, the other senpais are telling you to buy the skin, so I guess you have to buy the skin.
8680280	8691280	Unfortunately, I think that paying for a free to play game is absurd.
8691280	8697280	My question for you is how can I stop loving you so much, Kohai? Keep loving me.
8697280	8704280	You can't stop.
8704280	8706280	Next question.
8706280	8711280	A friend of mine got me with a trick. What is the sound of one hand plapping?
8711280	8715280	I still don't get it. Anyways, should I keep his car or get back to him?
8715280	8718280	Show him your moves. Show him your moves.
8718280	8722280	Clap with one hand.
8722280	8732280	I can't, I can't clap with one hand though, but if you, with enough practice, you can make a whole applause.
8732280	8740280	Do you get crowns limited skin? No, and I didn't care for crowns limited skin.
8740280	8744280	Read again. Clapping.
8744280	8753280	What's the difference between that? I thought that was just a spelling error.
8753280	8762280	I thought that was a spelling error. I thought they made one hand clapping.
8762280	8768280	You don't think so?
8768280	8774280	I have no idea what this means then.
8774280	8778280	I have no idea what this means then.
8778280	8782280	I thought it was a type ball.
8782280	8788280	I have no idea what this means then. What does this mean? Is this like a pull your finger thing?
8788280	8797280	Yeah, pull my finger.
8797280	8800280	I got it back in him.
8800280	8803280	Part on their pillow.
8803280	8810280	Leaf.
8810280	8817280	Anyways, I don't know what this means, but if it's enough to key the car,
8817280	8824280	well, I don't think that's enough. Keying your car is not enough.
8824280	8829280	It's not enough.
8829280	8840280	Okay, man, giving them the sugar-free, high-rebowl gummy bears as a gift.
8840280	8849280	You're welcome.
8850280	8853280	Mercy, I love being caged with you.
8853280	8862280	What does it say about my psyche? You're perfectly normal. Of course you want to stay.
8862280	8865280	Next question.
8865280	8871280	Hi, Mercy. I really enjoyed your streams, and I hope you get some good rest after your busy debut week.
8871280	8877280	I did have a question for your Q&A stream. I'm going to be writing an MCAT exam in a few months.
8877280	8884280	I know my call high was quite the student, so I was wondering if you had any tips for stepping to share a surprise.
8884280	8888280	Thanks, love you, Mercy.
8888280	8892280	Hmm, oops.
8892280	8895280	Next, over some stuff.
8895280	8900280	I just read my textbook out loud.
8900280	8906280	I read it out loud and I wrote some facts that I was like, oh, interesting, nice.
8906280	8910280	That's all I really did.
8910280	8921280	Sometimes if I really memorized something, I would read it out loud and write it on down as well, like rewrite the whole thing.
8921280	8928280	Just so it can be in my mind.
8928280	8934280	Take some breaks.
8934280	8937280	Why did you major in Mercy?
8937280	8943280	Well, a lot of things.
8943280	8949280	I rewrote and read out loud, so for example, if I grab what I have, I don't have a textbook.
8949280	8953280	Oh wait, I do have a textbook.
8953280	8956280	Sort of.
8956280	8962280	For here, I can have like, oh, shit.
8962280	8967280	Sort of.
8967280	8978280	Here, vocabulary where it's often used in the Japanese language proficiency test are divided into various themes organized into chapters and sections for ease of study.
8978280	8986280	You may progress equitably through each chapter or begin wherever at whatever chapter interests you.
8986280	8991280	Things like that. If you read it out loud, it works.
8992280	8996280	It works, generally.
8996280	9014280	What really helps me when I was studying was definitely reading it out loud, but also taking an actual interest in the subject.
9014280	9024280	So if I was reading something and I didn't like the subject or I thought the subject was boring, I didn't.
9024280	9031280	I didn't. I would force myself to be super interested in the subject.
9031280	9040280	I'd be forcing myself super interested hyperfixate on it.
9040280	9043280	Which is why. Oh my gosh.
9043280	9048280	Ring! Ring cloud! Hi!
9048280	9059280	I forced an interest. I don't know. Are you studying in a field that you want?
9059280	9066280	Most of the subjects I studied and I picked specific classes that...
9066280	9069280	What was the class you really enjoyed?
9069280	9073280	Oh!
9073280	9080280	The class I really enjoyed was...
9080280	9084280	What was it called?
9084280	9091280	Early communications... Early communication history.
9091280	9099280	A subject that one that I had no interest in? Calculus.
9099280	9103280	Calculus. I didn't give a shit about calculus.
9103280	9108280	I nearly failed calculus.
9114280	9118280	I hate math. I hate math.
9118280	9128280	It doesn't help that the professor, when I went up to the professor, when I was like, okay, I'm confused about this.
9128280	9134280	What do I do? How can you explain this to me? The professor was like, ask your peers.
9134280	9142280	And I went to ask my peers and they went, I don't know.
9142280	9146280	Great. Great. Great.
9146280	9150280	Fuck you.
9150280	9159280	That's probably another thing why I didn't like math at all.
9159280	9171280	And I'll tell you, when I was in elementary school, or grade school, I had, I loved math.
9171280	9180280	I loved math.
9180280	9190280	When I got to like middle school, high school, whatever you call those grades,
9190280	9195280	I was getting punished for getting the right answer right.
9195280	9205280	So for example, I would write, for example, I didn't put something in brackets, I got a zero in it.
9205280	9210280	Why would I put something in brackets if it doesn't require being in brackets?
9210280	9212280	For example, two times two. Why would I put that in brackets?
9212280	9216280	No, but because I didn't put it in brackets, I got a zero on it.
9216280	9230280	Another time, it equals, you know, like, or if you equal, and then there was a time where they made me write out my answers,
9230280	9236280	not like write out my answers like, oh, equals, so and so, like with the equals sign and the number,
9236280	9244280	they would write, they would make me write my process, they would make me write my process.
9244280	9253280	So I literally wrote, I added so and so and did it to this number.
9253280	9261280	And therefore, this question is this.
9261280	9265280	And this happened for many, many, many years.
9265280	9270280	And so I freaking hated math.
9270280	9274280	No, but like, it's not like show your work, like, oh, here's my like order of things.
9274280	9285280	It was, you had to physically write out what you did.
9285280	9298280	Like, literally, write out what you did, like, I added, I a space a d d d e d.
9298280	9306280	These numbers to do that.
9306280	9311280	And I said, and then you had to write down, like, the whole thing.
9311280	9316280	Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, I added three, two, four and equals seven for like that.
9316280	9319280	And that went on for years.
9319280	9322280	And which is why I hate math.
9329280	9331280	Which is why I hate math.
9331280	9339280	And then I was, I, my mama, mama, Mercy used to be a math teacher.
9339280	9341280	She used to be a math teacher.
9341280	9348280	Okay.
9348280	9349280	She used to be a math teacher.
9349280	9356280	So when I gave her my math homework to look over, she said it was fucking ridiculous.
9356280	9369280	She helped me, but she thought it was stupid because she looked over my test and she was like, why were you docked marks for not putting like, for example, if it's nine, if the answer is nine, right.
9369280	9375280	And the question does not call for to the first decimal decimal.
9375280	9382280	I was still being punished for like writing nine instead of 9.0.
9382280	9395280	Or if it was rounded to the next number and I would round it to the next number, I still got punished because for some reason I wasn't supposed to round it.
9395280	9408280	So my mom, my mom, mama, mama, Mercy understood why I hated math because she thought it was ridiculous.
9408280	9414280	She in fact went to the teacher and the teacher was like, well, that's how we do it here.
9414280	9417280	And mama was like, pissed.
9417280	9419280	She was pissed.
9422280	9424280	Mama was pissed.
9430280	9431280	So it didn't help.
9431280	9436280	And honestly, a lot of teachers did that to me.
9437280	9447280	So mama was pissed and like usually mama literally mama mama went, I used to be a math teacher.
9447280	9457280	And these questions are answered correctly because of this, this, this, and they're like, that's not how we do it in our curriculum.
9457280	9462280	So mama was like, if this is going to be like this, do not take math.
9462280	9463280	Avoid math.
9463280	9468280	Like mama was literally like, do not take math if this is how they're going to, going to do it.
9479280	9490280	But yeah, like, no, I ended up, I ended up, I think calculus, I ended up dropping, I ended up dropping because I was kind of ridiculous of how bad it was.
9494280	9498280	Yeah.
9500280	9504280	Anyways, that's how you become, you pass the MCAT and become a doctor.
9504280	9507280	I don't know what it goes with.
9507280	9520280	But if you read things out loud, if you do practice questions, if you do, if you do, was that uni math class?
9520280	9528280	Uni math class was the professor that was like, well ask your peers and I asked my peers and they're like, I don't fucking know.
9528280	9544280	It was like kind of like when I was still like grades one through whatever numbers in your country was when I hated math and that's where mama helped me the most.
9544280	9557280	All of my, all of my, all of my, all of my classes that kind of involved math were not great because probably because of my hate for them.
9557280	9563280	I ended up not doing very well in anything that did math.
9563280	9565280	So good luck Senpai.
9565280	9566280	Good luck on your MCAT.
9566280	9567280	Become a doctor.
9567280	9568280	Make lots of money.
9568280	9572280	Save people's lives.
9572280	9574280	A communication history was awesome.
9574280	9578280	Yeah.
9578280	9580280	Yeah.
9580280	9583280	Anything was theory with theory I excelled at.
9583280	9589280	So even if it's complex theory, I really loved.
9589280	9606280	I like complex theory and is not game theory, shut up.
9606280	9618280	For example, I like looking at theories and how history and how history works and basically formulating meanings into things.
9618280	9624280	Those things were really, really fun to me.
9625280	9627280	Like really, really fun to me.
9627280	9644280	So like if I had kind of like anything to do with like how if we talked about basically like how people perceive things and how things are and like theories relating to that.
9644280	9647280	That was great fun for me.
9647280	9650280	That was great fun for me.
9655280	9663280	So that was really a lot of fun and I can use that in everyday life too when I'm thinking about things.
9663280	9665280	Yeah, did I take philosophy?
9665280	9678280	No, but I took a lot of a lot of things, theory things and I a lot of times I would get it before my peers, my like classmates.
9679280	9687280	And so I would explain to my classmates and then with examples and stuff and they were like, oh, I get it now. Thanks.
9687280	9692280	But I managed to pick things up like theory right away.
9699280	9706280	Honestly, another course that I had lots of great fun in was law.
9707280	9711280	Law was really fun too.
9711280	9714280	I got an A plus in that course. It was really fun.
9714280	9724280	And the professor gave me like out of nowhere, he just gave me a grant.
9727280	9731280	He gave me a grant and I was like, oh, thank you.
9732280	9745280	It paid a good chunk of my tuition.
9752280	9755280	Yeah, it was really fun. It was really fun.
9755280	9763280	Professor asked me if I wanted to be a lawyer and I was like, I have to take math to become a lawyer.
9767280	9770280	Was that the one that told you to take acid? No.
9770280	9779280	Actually, the one that told me to take acid was the early communications history professor. That was really fun.
9786280	9793280	I would tell you, honestly, I would tell you more about my academic background.
9796280	9814280	But I think my, I think a lot of people would, would, um, would, I think a lot of people would, uh,
9815280	9822280	start to question exactly why, why I'm doing this line of work instead.
9826280	9831280	I think many people would question why I'm doing this line of work instead.
9834280	9843280	Oh, it's not like doxing myself. It's more like, I'd rather, I'd rather not tell
9843280	9856280	since a lot of people might judge by it. Just, just know, just know that maybe I'm a little overqualified.
9856280	9873280	That's it. But I don't really want to say because then people might start making theories and stuff.
9873280	9886280	Okay, what is the easiest way to get a girl to fall in love with you?
9887280	9890280	Unironically, be nice.
9895280	9899280	Unironically, be nice.
9899280	9920280	Now, be nice. Like, if you are a considerate person, um, if you are considerate, if you think of others,
9920280	9934280	uh, if you, like, for example, um, offer, offer your like umbrella or you like a coat if like a girl is like warm, she will notice that and she will remember that.
9935280	9943280	Shut the fuck up. No, don't be one of those nice, no, I'm literally mean, don't, like, you, you have to be genuine in your niceness though.
9944280	9949280	You have to be genuine in your niceness.
9952280	9965280	The bars and health, yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty low. Wouldn't they abuse that? Like, who is they? Who is they? Are you cheating on me? Are they?
9965280	9975280	Just be nice. Just be nice.
9977280	9986280	Like, if you say you're a nice guy and everyone around you said you're a big frickin' jerk, maybe you're not a nice guy.
9995280	9997280	Be a good person.
9999280	10012280	Literally, okay, fine, fine, fine. We'll change out semantics. We'll change semantics around, okay? Be a good person and you'll be noticed.
10013280	10017280	Be a good person.
10018280	10024280	Hold, hold doors open for someone. Check on someone if they're, they're okay.
10033280	10036280	Help, help your mom with your growth, with her groceries.
10037280	10050280	But what if I'm a bad boy? Some girls will like that, but I feel like most girls, or at least the girls that I know, genuinely prefer a good person.
10054280	10065280	Like, for example, if you, if you, like, don't be, don't be weird.
10067280	10075280	Don't be weird. Don't be like, oh, I bought this girl flowers and she wouldn't, she wouldn't give me a kiss goodnight.
10076280	10077280	Okay.
10087280	10095280	Instead, just be like, oh, I gave her flowers and she seemed to really like it and that's all I need, you know?
10096280	10112280	Not even a peck. I mean, like, it depends on the relationship. If you don't know her very well, or you don't have that type of relationship with her, then yeah.
10112280	10125280	Anyways, that doesn't apply to me though. Clearly, if I just kidnap my senpais, you'll fall in love with me, right? Easy.
10134280	10141280	What if she loves another guy? Move on. Move on. It's over. That moment, over. Move on.
10142280	10160280	Move on. It's over. I'm sorry. That's it. Next question.
10161280	10177280	Okay, help. I found this new Vtuber company that's full of cute. I don't know if that is girls. How can I save myself from their deadly grasp before it is too late? It's too late already. You have already fallen and you've been already groomed.
10178280	10179280	Okay, next question.
10180280	10192280	I need advice on how to get more beautiful Mercy laughter in my life. Make a clip compilation and play it over and over again.
10192280	10216280	How can I overcome my fear of job interviews? I have to earn money for us, you and me. I can't do it now if I'm too anxious to even go to a job interview.
10217280	10220280	Practice. Practice with your friends.
10225280	10237280	Practice with your friends. Practice in a mirror. Practice. Practice, practice, practice. Get your mom to sit down, ask you some interview questions, and then memorize them.
10237280	10254280	Force yourself. I don't like driving, but I drive a lot. So, as you just got to do it.
10254280	10266280	Sorry. Sorry, you just have to do it. Practice. If you go to a bunch of job interviews, it gets easier, trust me.
10268280	10276280	Next question. I've never been in a relationship before. How do you suggest I get a girlfriend? I'm already your girlfriend.
10277280	10280280	But remember Nyan Taddle.
10284280	10286280	I don't know how to approach women. Can you help?
10291280	10298280	Just talk to them? I think I've answered this one already. So, we'll move on.
10298280	10309280	Oh my gosh. Why do you guys always make these long morals? At least for Q&A.
10329280	10332280	Mercy, will you go out with me? I'm going out with every single senpai already.
10335280	10344280	We're all in a relationship. A loving relationship. I'm in a loving relationship with my senpais.
10344280	10360280	Mercy, I need some serious advice. How can I prove my love to you? If I prove it, will I be allowed out of the cage? I promise I won't ever leave. Please believe me.
10360280	10364280	Sounds like I can't believe you. Stay in the cage.
10365280	10382280	Hi, Mercy. I'm looking forward to giving up my agency and spending the rest of my days only looking at you.
10383280	10390280	Normally, I'd be a good senpai and just figure it out, but I heard you were offering life advice.
10390280	10402280	There are some fun ways to break it to my work that I will no longer be coming to the office and may not have internet access or a computer.
10402280	10407280	I don't know. I guess you have to leave your two weeks notice.
10410280	10413280	It's like, ah, personal agency.
10413280	10431280	I guess you leave your two weeks notice. I don't know how to say that. Just leave your two weeks notice and go peace.
10432280	10447280	Oh, but yeah, the cage has internet though. I let you, you have supervised, um, supervised internet.
10448280	10461280	For Q&A, I'm too lazy to do laundry, but also hate being perceived. Any tips on how to not do laundry while also being clothed enough to go outside without drawing gaps, gigs?
10463280	10473280	Goof? I don't know what that last word means. Um, wear clothes.
10474280	10477280	Wear clothes. You can re-wear your clothes.
10486280	10494280	Anyways, re-wear your clothes. Spray on some febrize or like some perfume. You're good to go by.
10494280	10503280	Ah, re-wear your clothes. Done.
10503280	10529280	We're live at Vice stream and feel free to respond serious or silly or not at all. I wouldn't, I won't mind just sharing some thoughts.
10529280	10537280	How do you think people bond? Or how do you build a stronger community where people want to be there doing things together?
10538280	10548280	Maybe you have some observation from VTubing. I don't ever plan to get together because every time I've tried, people haven't been interested.
10549280	10556280	And it's used to be less of a problem because I was involved in established friend groups and communities where I was invited.
10556280	10567280	But after college, especially COVID, I stopped receiving invitations. I feel like I don't know how to bootstrap group plans on my own.
10568280	10576280	I have parallel struggles at work getting more into leadership and struggling to motivate co-workers to engage.
10576280	10589280	I'm not sure if I'm the problem or if I'm surrounded by the wrong people. I think I'm probably well-liked as a side character but never people's inner circles.
10590280	10594280	I don't know what others do that I'm not doing. Thanks.
10595280	10597280	Okay.
10603280	10610280	This one might come off as a controversial answer. But you have to know your crowd.
10610280	10625280	You kind of have to know your crowd. So I have different friend groups and they all like different things. You cannot force the same things amongst them.
10626280	10631280	First of all, you're not a secondary character. You are someone important.
10632280	10642280	But don't forget you are also maybe perhaps yourself have been sealing yourself off due to COVID or what else did you say?
10648280	10653280	Or you're falling out with friends. Perhaps you've already put a shield amongst yourself.
10654280	10667280	But remember that you're each group of people if in order to engage and stuff they have their own interests and needs as well.
10668280	10676280	So for example, your co-workers maybe what is motivating them is different from what your friends are.
10676280	10683280	So for example, if you are in a leadership role and you're like everybody let's do an icebreaker perhaps it feels forced.
10685280	10689280	Perhaps it feels forced and people feel like they're obligated to do it.
10692280	10697280	Instead of something that you want to cultivate friendships with.
10698280	10720280	But if you're in a leadership position, you have to know that everyone will view you as the leader, the boss and someone who either you listen to and they will not want to engage in like a friendship type of thing.
10721280	10729280	I don't think workplaces are a great place to make friends simply because there's that power dynamic that people feel around you.
10731280	10739280	As well as well with your friend groups and other friend groups, you really have to get to know what they're into.
10740280	10748280	So if you're going to suggest something like, oh, hey, let's do a movie together, you have to be have to gauge what kind of movie they're into.
10748280	10756280	For example, I have a group of friends who loves watching anime, but the other group of friends does not like watching anime.
10757280	10765280	And therefore they would prefer to watch something such as old retro classic movies.
10765280	10778280	Like the birds. Let's just pick the birds as an example.
10782280	10788280	Or like even Shrek, exactly, like maybe your friend group, that friend group prefer friends or something.
10788280	10795280	At the same time, understand that there's a dynamic within friend groups that might be a little different than what you're into.
10796280	10810280	Instead of trying to be the people pleaser and the event organizer for your friends, I highly recommend making events with only perhaps one friend or two friends amongst your peers.
10811280	10814280	Don't try to force people together who don't want to be together.
10819280	10829280	So maybe they're cool with just hanging out and talking in like a group group chat, but they're not okay with hanging out in a call.
10833280	10845280	So in that case, I would say lower your friendship group to about one or two people that you can truly hang out with at any time.
10846280	10851280	How you pick those people is entirely based off how you connect with them.
10852280	10868280	Remember, if you are in a place of leadership at your workplace, your co-workers may not be the best people to force into or motivate into engaging with things because to them it is an additional chore.
10869280	10889280	Meanwhile, in another group, if you have a bigger group of friends or if you're new to their environment and you're kind of still in the initiation, we're still getting to know you do not force it.
10890280	10904280	Do not force it. You will simply make yourself feel like you are too gogetty or you're too strong-handed in your suggestions for events.
10907280	10913280	So instead, don't try to force things. Make them as suggestions instead.
10914280	10922280	That's how you deal with people. Don't forget, you are not the side character. People do care about you.
10923280	10931280	People do care about you. You are someone that someone cares about. But remember, you have to take care of yourself first.
10932280	10948280	You have to take care of yourself first. Then organize events for people because if you are making events for people to like you, that is not the way to go.
10950280	10952280	That is not the way to go.
10953280	10964280	If you are making events because you are close friends with these friends, okay. Ask first. Ask. Hey, do you guys want to do this?
10965280	10974280	And see if you can, see if you're, you can gage if they're saying yes out of politeness or yes out of like genuine interest.
10976280	10979280	Okay. Bam.
10980280	10983280	I hope that was okay advice.
10991280	10992280	Next question.
10993280	11003280	Hi, Mercy. The city I live in just announced that there will be no water tomorrow for maintenance.
11003280	11010280	I'm already filling water in buckets, cups and whatnot. My question is what's the best container to put water in? Sorry for the really dumb question.
11011280	11012280	A carafe.
11020280	11022280	I would say carafe.
11022280	11023280	A carafe.
11032280	11034280	You can just use a carafe for drinking water.
11035280	11040280	If you're looking for water for like watering the garden or something, I suggest a rain barrel.
11040280	11053280	A what? A carafe. Do you not know what a carafe is?
11058280	11060280	Okay, it's about like carafe.
11060280	11061280	Okay.
11064280	11065280	A carafe.
11065280	11069280	C-A-R-A-F-E.
11069280	11073280	It is a container used to serve liquid.
11079280	11081280	C-A-R-A.
11082280	11085280	F-E-C-A-R-A.
11085280	11088280	F-E-C-A-R-A.
11088280	11089280	F-E-C-A-R-A-F-E.
11089280	11094280	It is not carafe. It is a carafe.
11099280	11103280	Like giraffe, but a carafe.
11109280	11112280	Drinking water is great in a carafe.
11113280	11115280	Especially if it has a lid on it.
11119280	11122280	Anyways, yeah.
11123280	11126280	I would use it in carafe.
11128280	11130280	Store things in the carafe and stuff.
11131280	11132280	That's it.
11138280	11144280	I have a few of them because it keeps water cooler and you can also put juice and stuff.
11144280	11152280	But my, I also have, there's one called a, there's a carafe that you can put on your bedside table.
11152280	11161280	So it's, it's like the cup is functions at the lid and you can just use it to like drink water as in bed, essentially.
11162280	11163280	Done.
11167280	11171280	So yeah, you can get them pretty much anywhere.
11172280	11176280	That's up for hand washing and non-water stuff. Yeah.
11177280	11183280	But for drinking water, I suggest using a few boil things, if you boil it.
11183280	11191280	A carafe can be like hot water safe, but be careful because it is glass.
11191280	11199280	So let the boiled water cool down to maybe room temperature or even, or even colder, colder than that.
11200280	11203280	Cooler than that. And then you can just pour it into the carafe.
11204280	11209280	How big are carafs? It really depends on what carafe you have.
11210280	11219280	For example, I have a carafe that is like two liters.
11224280	11228280	So they aren't really uniform at all, but they're really good.
11228280	11230280	I have a few of them.
11233280	11239280	I have a few of them at my house and Papa always fills them up when he's bored.
11239280	11241280	So there's lots of drinking water.
11245280	11246280	You're welcome.
11246280	11247280	You're welcome.
11252280	11255280	I don't know how much, excuse me.
11255280	11259280	I don't know how much that is in Freedom Units. I'm sorry.
11269280	11273280	That's why I'm just like, oh, okay, well, that's, uh...
11276280	11284280	No, seriously, I have no idea how much this is in Freedom Units, but I have like a few of them.
11289280	11291280	Next question.
11295280	11300280	Oh no, my stomach is growling. I hope you guys can't hear that.
11301280	11306280	So I recently hung out with this girl and she brought a friend along.
11308280	11312280	The girls got a little silly and jokingly called me their dog.
11312280	11316280	They even put a collar around my neck and asked me to bark for them.
11316280	11319280	They were super excited and I found myself too polite to decline.
11319280	11324280	And they rewarded me with head baths and doggy kisses, which felt kind of weird.
11324280	11328280	Any advice for handling similar situations in the future?
11331280	11336280	What advice do you need? You are now a dog. Mark?
11339280	11342280	Like, do you hate it or what?
11342280	11347280	I feel like this is, this is like a lot of people's dreams, right?
11349280	11352280	Anyways, arf, arf, arf, start barking!
11360280	11362280	Okay.
11368280	11369280	Okay.
11373280	11375280	Hi, where are you going?
11379280	11386280	I don't know how you're getting out to meet other girls, so clearly this person isn't a senpai, so I don't give a shit.
11387280	11388280	Okay?
11390280	11391280	Okay.
11402280	11407280	Dear Mercy, I came here to tell you about my problem, helping to make it more problematic.
11408280	11411280	My issue is that I can't read the atmosphere around me.
11411280	11416280	I am socially inept and quite naive all the time, especially when it comes to people.
11417280	11421280	Especially when it comes to problematic situations, or just talking to people.
11423280	11425280	I'm gonna tell you, it's always gonna be worse.
11427280	11430280	Live and learn! Live and learn!
11431280	11436280	Honestly, I have trouble telling apart situations and stuff too, so.
11438280	11440280	I've only learned with experience.
11441280	11443280	I think that's called masking.
11447280	11448280	Mask up!
11455280	11456280	So mask up!
11458280	11459280	Mask up!
11459280	11461280	And start pretending!
11464280	11465280	You're welcome!
11466280	11482280	Life advice, hypothetically, if someone were trying to get a decent chunk, going through a decent chunk of anime, let's just say two seasons and two movies, would you have any tips on how to sleep less and anime more?
11484280	11488280	I don't know about you, but I have...
11488280	11501280	I have hyper fixation, like super hyper fixation, so I won't stop until I finish.
11502280	11503280	So I don't know about you, Senpai.
11504280	11511280	I suppose it's okay if you do it at like 1.5 speed, yeah.
11514280	11516280	Like, what anime?
11516280	11518280	Ah, clearly, it's Cardcaptor Sakura!
11523280	11527280	But hyper fixation, I have a hyper fixation, so I just watch it.
11529280	11533280	I just watch the whole thing, because I'm really into it.
11535280	11536280	Oh yeah, you're welcome!
11537280	11540280	1.5 isn't bad, as long as you get the plot and everything.
11541280	11546280	Two times speed if you're watching pause.
11549280	11558280	So yeah, if I hyper fixate on something, for example, I have to literally stop myself from playing games all the way, so...
11562280	11564280	Yeah, I recommend...
11565280	11572280	Maybe doing 1.5 speed if you want to do that, if you want to...
11575280	11583280	If you want to watch it in all its entirety, in the original format, it's in.
11586280	11590280	I like it, just like it, and you won't sleep.
11591280	11597280	I haven't heard Tenchi Murio in a long time, I used to read that, read the mango.
11599280	11608280	But yeah, that is all the question I have, and I went through Senpai 44 questions.
11609280	11616280	I went through 44 questions, and I kept on getting some in the middle of stream, so I can...
11621280	11626280	I can see all of this.
11627280	11630280	Oh, I got so many questions during streams.
11632280	11639280	I'll see if I can pick one from what I've gotten in case someone wants something.
11642280	11643280	Okay...
11651280	11654280	What is my ideal order at McDonald's?
11655280	11659280	Quarter pounder without cheese.
11660280	11664280	A quarter pounder without cheese combo.
11665280	11670280	Nesty and large fries.
11671280	11672280	Dad.
11681280	11682280	Nothing.
11684280	11692280	Going to college starting this fall, any advice from Kohai on time management and relationships once I start the school year?
11695280	11701280	Your time management is based off of your time's table, not like your schedule.
11702280	11708280	And your relationships, I recommend setting up specific days where you can hang out with your friends.
11708280	11710280	For example, I think...
11711280	11719280	I had a short day on Fridays, and so I hung out with my friends on Fridays after school, yeah.
11723280	11726280	No cheese? Oh, I don't like cheese on my burger.
11727280	11728280	Didn't say Nuggies.
11729280	11733280	I'm not a huge fan of the Nuggies. They don't taste good without the sauce.
11734280	11739280	Are you a fan of McClurry? Oh, I think they're okay, but I don't indulge in them all the time.
11746280	11747280	Um, let's see...
11749280	11755280	I'm getting too perished social to VTubers. Should I turn it down with watching, just step back or stay as I am?
11755280	11756280	I'm afraid of heartbreak.
11757280	11759280	I don't know how to answer that to you because the...
11760280	11768280	Senpai, I want you to be with me all the time, but if it's not good for your health, step back.
11770280	11775280	I honestly don't like McDonald's chicken nuggets.
11776280	11781280	So I don't know how Americans can eat it, because it tastes like rubber.
11781280	11788280	Um, is it because you don't like ice cream too often, or because McDonald's ice creams are broken all the time?
11788280	11792280	Um, I guess they're all broken all the time, but they're kind of expensive.
11793280	11795280	They're kind of expensive.
11812280	11821280	No! It tastes better in Canada. It tastes like chicken, so I don't know what's up with Americans.
11822280	11828280	But I don't like... Sometimes I just... I don't want to eat something with sauce, right?
11828280	11834280	So if the chicken nuggets can't taste good without sauce, then I don't really like it.
11834280	11839280	I guess...
11842280	11850280	I actually prefer Burger King over McDonald's in terms of like chicken nuggets.
11853280	11856280	I think their nuggets are better. Their breading is better.
11856280	11865280	But, um, yeah, McDonald's is really expensive. What about Wendy's?
11865280	11871280	According to someone who works at Wendy's, I cannot eat Wendy's due to my allergy.
11879280	11884280	So if I had to order at McDonald's, since there's a lot of McDonald's around,
11885280	11894280	and it's very convenient, I will get myself a quarter pounder or a double hamburger. No cheese.
11901280	11905280	Speaking of BK Nuggets, spicy or regular? I kind of like the spicy one.
11906280	11916280	What about at Tim Hortons Coal High? Um, like I said, if I go to Tim Hortons, I would order a multi-grain bagel with cream cheese.
11916280	11918280	Or just butter, depending on how I feel.
11920280	11924280	I think that's fine, but I just don't like cheese on my burgers.
11929280	11931280	Let's see...
11935280	11945280	Any advice for moving out?
11947280	11951280	I am trying to be more independent. Any recommendations for searching for a new cage or saving money?
11951280	11954280	If you can't answer, a simple good luck would be nice. Good luck!
11955280	11960280	I, uh, haven't ever moved out. I still love all my parents.
11961280	11966280	Sorry, Senpai, but good luck to you!
11971280	11973280	Let's see...
11978280	11981280	Some of these questions are going to be too long to answer.
11991280	12002280	Okay, sorry, Senpai, some of these questions are very long, and we've already been here for about, for over three hours now.
12002280	12027280	We've been here for over three hours now, so I think, um, I think that should be it for questions.
12027280	12031280	Unfortunately, a lot of the questions I got in are a little bit more intimate.
12031280	12041280	And I probably wouldn't be able to answer them in a good amount of time.
12042280	12045280	But my stomach is growling, Senpai.
12045280	12050280	Like, my stomach is growling, and I'm very hungry.
12053280	12059280	I'm very hungry, so I'm just going to have to say goodbye for now.
12062280	12076280	So, I hope Senpai has a great time.
12077280	12083280	Oh, somebody sent me a question again. I'm sorry if it's the long question. I don't think I can answer.
12084280	12090280	Okay, maybe I can answer this one.
12090280	12094280	What is a good relationship for us viewers to have with you?
12094280	12096280	A loving one!
12098280	12099280	A loving one!
12099280	12103280	And it says, uh, if you're willing to break kayfabe again.
12103280	12110280	A loving relationship, but please do not become overly attached.
12110280	12112280	That is the end.
12113280	12121280	Anyway, thanks Senpai for joining me.
12125280	12131280	I hope you have a good one. I hope some of these advice helps you or ruins your life. I don't really know.
12135280	12141280	So, I'll see you tomorrow's my day off, so I won't see you tomorrow.
12142280	12145280	I'll see you Wednesday. Wednesday!
12145280	12148280	No, no, no, no. It's a normal day.
12148280	12150280	Wednesday, I'm playing amori.
12150280	12155280	Thursday, I am streaming quite early because of a collab.
12157280	12162280	Because of a collab, so please remember the time is different.
12162280	12170280	Check the calendar. Check the waiting room that I put up.
12170280	12174280	So make sure you can catch it. If you can't catch it, please catch a lot of it.
12174280	12177280	I'm sure you have a great time.
12177280	12183280	Okay, anyways, goodbye Senpai!
12183280	12185280	I love you!
12185280	12188280	Screen for Mercy!
12200280	12205280	Thanks for watching!
