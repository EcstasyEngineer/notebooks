Senpai, should I have been blonde?
Now I'm serious when I ask you that, you see?
I didn't always look like this.
In development, I actually looked more like this.
You notice my hair drills?
I also was a bit more modest, wasn't I?
Oh, nai modist.
See how different I could have been?
Eventually, Vialor made me just like this.
And isn't it perfect?
You like my final version now, right?
Right, Senpai?
