1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
music

2
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Wahoo! It's a me! Mercio!

3
00:06:40,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is it Senpai? Is the game playing at the same time? Are you getting overlapping audio?

4
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're getting overlapping audio?

5
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay. No overlap? No overlap?

6
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay.

7
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, no overlap. It's okay.

8
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Attack A.

9
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me try to push the game up.

10
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If it's too quiet.

11
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How about now?

12
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No eye patch today?

13
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now you get both eyes because I am not Mercy Modiste! I am Mercio Mercio!

14
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's a me!

15
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a me! Did I grab this already?

16
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh my gosh, they're walking off.

17
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I tuned into the wrong streamer! You're in the right stream! This is exactly where you're supposed to be!

18
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How am I supposed to get that high?

19
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Platforming hard. Platforming not good.

20
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Platforming already? I want this! I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it!

21
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hold it!

22
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it!

23
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And,

24
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
what?

25
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hello?

26
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Good day, my name is Puchinelo Bomb. Puchinelo, never heard of ya.

27
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They say I'm a hothead, but I'll show em. You, you will make me famous.

28
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So long!

29
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

30
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Penelopeep!

31
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Pelish.

32
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I think Jep will work on him.

33
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,440
I mean fireball won't work on him. He's he's he's uh

34
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,080
He's

35
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Wait, maybe he's weak to fire because he's a bomb, but would bombs also be more powerful with fire

36
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Let's try

37
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Oh

38
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Let's see if this works

39
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,800
It better not be a one again I

40
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,520
Swear if it's a one again friendship cannot be a rock. I will cry

41
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Why do you have so many

42
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Do I hit the micro bomb first

43
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Oh shut the fork off

44
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Oh

45
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Please play a wish

46
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,960
Not bad not bad now. Let's level things up

47
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,480
Why do you have bigger bombs now?

48
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Oh

49
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Yeah

50
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared actually

51
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm scared of these bombs

52
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Please just die

53
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,180
I

54
00:13:37,200 --> 00:14:02,640
I'm GAMING SEMPAI!

55
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
That's rude!

56
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
How many freaking bombs do you have?

57
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,640
I'm out!

58
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,920
I'm out!

59
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,220
Fuck.

60
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,280
Oh, I'm out.

61
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,580
Oof.

62
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
OOF!

63
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,540
AHH!

64
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,840
I'm okay!

65
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,840
Grrr!

66
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,840
Alright, you asked for it!

67
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,400
HOOA!

68
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,320
Excuse me.

69
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
I'm gonna need some F.P.

70
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
I'm out!

71
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,140
UGH!

72
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,140
UGH!

73
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Actually, we'll just tap.

74
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,740
Dang it.

75
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,040
Dang it!

76
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:37,940
Dang it!

77
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,940
OI!

78
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,540
OOF!

79
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,540
OOF!

80
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,040
OOF!

81
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
UGH!

82
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,840
Wake up!

83
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,040
Thanks!

84
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Come on, Mauo! Wake up! Wake up!

85
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
We can't have you do this!

86
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Oh, come on!

87
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Come on!

88
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Get on!

89
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Bite the dust!

90
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Please bite the dust!

91
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Please bite the dust!

92
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Please bite the dust!

93
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Please bite the dust!

94
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
I need you!

95
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Who may be, you know, not have a good time!

96
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh yeah!

97
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
OOF!

98
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
OOF!

99
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
OOF!

100
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
UGH!

101
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I must be dreaming! I'm ruined!

102
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,040
I don't want to do this, but now I have no choice.

103
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
I think he's bluffing.

104
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Simmer down, Fluffy!

105
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
I'm not gonna waste this on you!

106
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Who knows what might happen?

107
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Take your best shot.

108
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Enough! I've got my pride!

109
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Now you're in for it!

110
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Huh? What the hell? Why isn't it working?

111
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
OOF!

112
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Mario!

113
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,040
If this thing explodes, we're history!

114
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
This is a fine mess.

115
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Let's scram now!

116
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
It's gonna blow!

117
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
No!

118
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
What on earth was that?

119
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Well, we won the battle. I hope we don't lose the war.

120
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Where's dynamite in the star?

121
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,040
I guess that's part of it that's been answered.

122
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Come on, Mario! Hurry!

123
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
I can't believe they survived!

124
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Yay! Another star!

125
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
How many we got now? Three? Three!

126
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Yeah!

127
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Come on, we still have to find dynamite.

128
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Where the heck am I?

129
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Can I get this yet?

130
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Man!

131
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Man!

132
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Ugh! This won't budge! Ugh! I hate this stupid thing!

133
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Help me! Help me here! Give me... Give the mine a car...

134
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Mine car a push!

135
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Care to read the warning? Of course!

136
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Mine car guidelines. Press A to break. Press B to jump.

137
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Get mushrooms and press X to accelerate.

138
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
That's a lot of instructions!

139
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Mulville Safety Board MSB.

140
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Yay! A mine car ride! Yippee! This is gonna be fun!

141
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Ah!

142
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Come on!

143
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
This is difficult, actually!

144
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Ah! Come on!

145
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Oh!

146
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Are you kidding me?!

147
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
I did that!

148
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Oh, come on!

149
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Shit.

150
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Ugh!

151
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,040
I'm dying here, guys! I'm dying here!

152
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
I'm dying here!

153
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Oops.

154
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
This is a lot.

155
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,040
I can't drive, by the way! This is not the same as driving!

156
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,040
I'm getting dizzy! I'm getting motion sick!

157
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I'm getting dizzy! I'm getting motion sick!

158
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Motion sick!

159
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
My mind!

160
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Oh! Oh! Fuck!

161
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Oh, shit!

162
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Oh!

163
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
I need the mushrooms!

164
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Come on!

165
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Let's go!

166
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Let's go!

167
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Here we go!

168
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Whoa!

169
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
I'm dying here!

170
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
I'm dying here!

171
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I'm dying here!

172
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
I'm dying here!

173
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
I'm dying here!

174
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
I'm dying here!

175
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
I'm dying here!

176
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm dying here!

177
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Yay! Fireworks!

178
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
I wonder how old those kids are doing.

179
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Sure wish they would hurry home.

180
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
How old your heart is, Ma?

181
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
I asked Ma to help us out.

182
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,040
So I reckon he'll bring him back when he's good and ready.

183
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,040
I just have this odd feeling that they'll be dropping in on us any minute now.

184
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,040
They still gotta use the door like everyone else might now, so down!

185
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
We're home!

186
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Gracious! They really did drop in on us!

187
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Oh my poor babies, are you okay?

188
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Little Ma, are you hurt?

189
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Now we're okay, Ma.

190
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Isn't that right, Ma?

191
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
We had fun!

192
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
He's been knocked senseless, you poor baby.

193
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
You're safe now.

194
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Donna, haven't I told you off enough to never go into the mines by yourself?

195
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
That's enough, Ma.

196
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Just be happy to have them back.

197
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
We haven't thanked Mario proper either.

198
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
I'm so embarrassed, Ma.

199
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Mario, we can't thank you enough for everything.

200
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
What's that?

201
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
The roof, you say?

202
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Nah, don't matter none, right Pa?

203
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
It ain't nothing at all.

204
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
You just leave any repairs to me.

205
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Give me a hauler if you ever need a hand with your place.

206
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Thanks again for bringing our babies back to us.

207
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,040
You found Dina, Mike, and a star piece.

208
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
But where's Peach?

209
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm jumping everywhere.

210
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Whee!

211
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Come back, Mr. Beetle.

212
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Don't you want to come to boosters and play?

213
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Yeah, don't run away.

214
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
We just want to play.

215
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
We don't take good care of you.

216
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Like what he said, okay, Mr. Beetle?

217
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Oi!

218
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
No.

219
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Don't you dare touch that babe.

220
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Beetle, it's a present for Booster.

221
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040
That's right, just hand it over nice and easy.

222
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Yeah, like they said, we won't be your friend.

223
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Booster really, really, really likes Beetles, but he can't catch his own.

224
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,040
That's right, he's busy keeping the princess from the sky entertained.

225
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Oh, we're catching Beetles for him.

226
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
So hand it over.

227
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
That's right.

228
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Uh, pretty please?

229
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Oh no, it's getting away.

230
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
But catch it.

231
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Catch it!

232
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Oh, look, the moles are here.

233
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Welcome to my Purr 10 store.

234
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Would you like a shiny stone?

235
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Sure.

236
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,040
You bring me fireworks, then I'll give you a shiny stone.

237
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Fireworks?

238
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Where can I get fireworks?

239
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Me.

240
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Unnamed.

241
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,040
I call myself Tee, a drink of jam and bread.

242
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Hold on.

243
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Tee, a drink of jam and bread.

244
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Oops, that's not how it really goes.

245
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
I'm just bored, but if you go to the mountain, I'll sing you the real song.

246
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Okay, our Mobile Mountain stands at 32566.

247
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Come back and ride it again.

248
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,040
If you try, just go through the inn and rest.

249
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
This hole.

250
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,040
This hole, it belongs to me.

251
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
It's my hole.

252
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Oh.

253
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,040
Well, Mercio, you could get them to the fireworks factory.

254
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
What fireworks factory?

255
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Oh my gosh, is she me?

256
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
Welcome Raiders.

257
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Welcome to the stream.

258
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Oh, I mean, oh, welcome.

259
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Welcome Raiders.

260
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Welcome to the stream.

261
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,040
It's me, Mercio.

262
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
It's me, Mercio.

263
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,040
We are trying to find a page.

264
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Surprise.

265
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Oh, I'm so shocked.

266
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I'm so shocked.

267
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Wow, what a surprise.

268
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Welcome, Raiders.

269
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Chibi, did you beat the big boss?

270
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Not the bad Mario.

271
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
What are you talking about?

272
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
This is the real Mario.

273
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,040
This is the real Mario voice.

274
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
I am not the Mario.

275
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,040
This is the real Mario voice.

276
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
I am not the Mario.

277
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
This is Mercio.

278
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
I am the Mercio.

279
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,040
We are playing the Mario RPG.

280
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
This is the real Mercio here.

281
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,040
You can't tell me otherwise.

282
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
This is not Mercimogees.

283
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
This is Mercio, Mercio.

284
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Look at it.

285
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
It's real in my hat.

286
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
What does it stand for?

287
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Mercio.

288
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
And it's for Mercy.

289
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Look at me, I do the jump.

290
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Look at me, I do the jump.

291
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
It's fun, okay?

292
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Take a joke.

293
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Does that make us the princess in another castle?

294
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,040
You're all my princesses now and I must save you all.

295
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Well, welcome.

296
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm so glad you're here.

297
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
What a surprise.

298
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Not that I made some suspicious sounds

299
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,040
in your chat or anything.

300
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Speaking of...

301
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,040
I put back batteries into my automaton.

302
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Now I am a menace to society.

303
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Menace sounds like me.

304
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
It sounds like me.

305
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Senpai.

306
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Thank you, joke R, for the 420.

307
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Wouldn't this be a Louisbee raven?

308
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Um, Louisbee.

309
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Louisbee, come on.

310
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Louisbee, come on.

311
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Ah, Louisbee.

312
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Mercio and Louisbee superstar.

313
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,040
I don't know if she's gonna hate me or love me for that.

314
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
I love her.

315
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Well, welcome.

316
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Thank you, everyone.

317
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Thank you, Shibi, for the raid.

318
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Welcome in.

319
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
We are playing Mario RPG.

320
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,040
I have gotten three stars already.

321
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
Shibi's a taller one, so it makes sense.

322
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I mean, yeah.

323
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Somebody, oh wait, and then that means like...

324
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
I see would be Peach.

325
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
And then...

326
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
I don't know who to assign who.

327
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Bowser can be...

328
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Emmie?

329
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
No, Emmie's told, yeah.

330
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Emmie's told, and then Bowser can be...

331
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Azura.

332
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Azura, and then...

333
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
What other Mario characters are there?

334
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Bowser.

335
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
Strony is something.

336
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Yoshi?

337
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Daisy?

338
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Strony.

339
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,040
I mean, Strony has...

340
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
As Yoshi sounds pretty cute.

341
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Strow sheet, no.

342
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
No, never mind.

343
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
That sounds so bad.

344
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
Hahaha.

345
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,040
I mean, Yoshi lays eggs, right?

346
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,040
And technically, Strony laid...

347
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
I mean, laid?

348
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Uh, Barthed, all of us, right?

349
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Hahaha.

350
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Technically.

351
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Therefore...

352
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
It is correct.

353
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Welcome, Sam, to Snippin' Him Out Here!

354
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
This logic is sound.

355
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Yes, I agree. Give me a second, though.

356
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Yes, yes.

357
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Flawless logic!

358
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,040
This hole, my wife dug, is a shortcut to the trolley.

359
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Does it mean it's going to ride, and I am named a Mobile Mountain?

360
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Name that nifty.

361
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Drop in here, and you'll be right at the trolley track.

362
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
It'll cost you 10 coins.

363
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Asgore is, uh...

364
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Oh, yeah, it's, uh, 32566.

365
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Do you want to ride or not? No.

366
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Be that way!

367
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
I thought she was winking at us.

368
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
There you go.

369
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,040
Right? 10 coins feels like Kai-Way robbery.

370
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
You heard?

371
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,040
There's a rumor that Booster's new girlfriend fell from the sky.

372
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,040
She's supposed to be pretty, too, just like a princess.

373
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Now, now, who would have thought a girl could fall out of the sky?

374
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Maybe it's Princess Peach.

375
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Nah.

376
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
It's Princess Peach.

377
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
It's Princess Peach.

378
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Check out Booster's tower!

379
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
It's filled with neat stuff!

380
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,040
My eyes are off gossiping again. She's been gone for hours.

381
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
You like fireworks? I'm like a mom.

382
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Own invention right now.

383
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I've only got sparklers down my hand and giving up.

384
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
Want to buy 100, 500 coins?

385
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Yeah.

386
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,040
Thanks.

387
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Yeah, just wait for my masterpiece.

388
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
I'm back with one point.

389
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Coins by my inventions, okay?

390
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
Alright, got fireworks.

391
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Yeah, now I can get that shiny stone!

392
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
Here you go.

393
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
Welcome to my pretend store.

394
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
Would you like a shiny stone? Yeah.

395
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
I'm going to trade you for your fireworks.

396
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Yeah.

397
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
Thank you. Please come again.

398
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Got shiny stone.

399
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
I don't even know what it does.

400
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
Is it just Purdy?

401
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Is she just Purdy?

402
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Hold on.

403
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
No, wait. What's the menu?

404
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
There we go.

405
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
Hoop-a-chill.

406
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
I have no idea what the shiny stone...

407
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
shiny, shiny stone does.

408
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Oh, thank you, Fiendish,

409
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,040
for gifting 10 members.

410
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Thank you.

411
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
You know Booster?

412
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
He's the weirdo living in the tower.

413
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
A little ways from here.

414
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Come on in. You're the talk of town.

415
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
They say that you save the kids.

416
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
What do you need?

417
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
What do I need?

418
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
Oh shit, I have no coins!

419
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Wait, I spent it all!

420
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
I spent it all!

421
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
On the rock!

422
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
I wanted the rock!

423
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
Where's the rock?

424
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Where's even the rock?

425
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,040
I'm so hungry, wish I had a Carbo Cookie.

426
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Welcome to my pretend store.

427
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,040
Would you like a shiny stone?

428
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
No items left. Thank you. Please come again.

429
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
It's dried, I'm so worried about it.

430
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
Okay, so I can trade it for...

431
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,040
in the mole girls?

432
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
You can't get inside Booster's tower very easily.

433
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
You need a really strong person for that.

434
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
I want a nice shiny stone.

435
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
I'll trade it for my Carbo Cookie.

436
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
Okay, gracious.

437
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
Here you go.

438
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Carbo Cookie.

439
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Thank you for the mines.

440
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
I opened some neat stuff and I opened up a minor store.

441
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
Come and take a look at what I got to sell.

442
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
Item number one, a lucky jewel.

443
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
I'm sure to bring you plenty of good luck.

444
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
I'll sell it to you for 100 coins.

445
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
You need more coins, I gotta eat, you know?

446
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
That's all I got for now.

447
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
Man!

448
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Okay.

449
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
Oh, you have a Carbo Cookie.

450
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,040
I'm so hungry, may I have it please?

451
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,040
Oh, thanks, sister.

452
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
You're so nice, I'll give you the screen coin.

453
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
That's all I got!

454
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Man.

455
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
I feel like I've been ripped, like, actually.

456
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
I can't believe that I really got ripped off.

457
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
He missed it, did you ride on my paws, trolley?

458
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
He says I'm too young to ride it.

459
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
I feel like...

460
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,040
I need to get another shiny stone, yeah.

461
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
Mercy, without the eye patch, what are you talking about?

462
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,040
I'm Mercy L!

463
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
See?

464
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
Oh, 500!

465
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,040
I feel so ripped off!

466
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,040
Oh, oh, oh!

467
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
Oh!

468
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,040
Ally!

469
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,040
I'm never doing that again.

470
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,040
Oh.

471
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
I need more money now.

472
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Money!

473
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
Hey, booster pass!

474
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
I only got one.

475
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
Platforming hard!

476
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
Hey, was there cool stuff over there?

477
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Hold on.

478
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,040
Would you like a sack of gold?

479
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,040
Is it better than a sack of...

480
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
shit?

481
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
I'm so sorry.

482
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
I'm sorry.

483
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,040
I'm trying to find places.

484
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
But yes, I would always love gold.

485
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,040
Why are they...

486
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,040
in there?

487
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,040
Was I supposed to do something there?

488
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,040
Oh my gosh!

489
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
It's Bowser!

490
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,040
Booster has such a nice place.

491
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,040
I miss my fortress.

492
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Wait, Booster has such a nice place.

493
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
I miss my fortress.

494
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,040
Miss the good old days.

495
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Peach screaming in terror.

496
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,040
Mario rushing in to save her.

497
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,040
Oh!

498
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Look!

499
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
He likes us.

500
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
He likes us.

501
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
Oh, Jesus, Mario!

502
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Oops, okay, okay, calm down.

503
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,040
Don't let him see you like this.

504
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
Hey, I win.

505
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,040
He has a crush on us.

506
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,040
Admit it, he has a crush on us.

507
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,040
He has a crush on us.

508
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Just, hey, how you doing?

509
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,040
He's being so Sunday.

510
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
No, not like that dummy wrong tone.

511
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,040
He needs more confidence.

512
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
You!

513
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
What are you doing here?

514
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,040
If Peach were on my castle waiting to be rescued,

515
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,040
she'd be crying like a baby.

516
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,040
Oh!

517
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,040
Did I just hear some...

518
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,040
Did I hear some voices?

519
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,040
It couldn't be.

520
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,040
I can't believe it.

521
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,040
It's Mario.

522
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,040
Mario!

523
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
I'm up here!

524
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,040
That voice is Peach.

525
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,040
I thought she got away,

526
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,040
but she's stuck there.

527
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,040
Well, I guess I'll be

528
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
returning to my castle now.

529
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Out of my way, Shorty!

530
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,040
Wait, okay, that's a good Peach voice.

531
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,040
But you don't like my other voices?

532
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,040
I think they're great.

533
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
It's locked.

534
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,040
What's the matter?

535
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
The door's not opening or something?

536
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,040
He's so cute.

537
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,040
He's helping!

538
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,040
Yeah, I'm a piece of work, ain't I?

539
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,040
Whoa, hold up.

540
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,040
We've got to stop the way inside now, huh?

541
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,040
You doing okay?

542
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,040
As well?

543
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,040
Can you do a mercy impression?

544
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
Oh, this power end looks too.

545
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
I know, I know, you're thinking.

546
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
A big, strong guy like him

547
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,040
would be great to get along, right?

548
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,040
I'm gonna do something. I may regret later.

549
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
I'll let you join my minions.

550
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,040
You can thank me later.

551
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
Mario and his friends have joined

552
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
Bowser's minions.

553
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
Or so they're pretending.

554
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,040
Bowser joined the group!

555
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,040
Oh, that's so cute!

556
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,040
Would you like an explanation on how to switch allies?

557
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,040
Yes, please.

558
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,040
No!

559
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
I can't remember what Toad's voice is like.

560
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,040
I can't remember Toad's voice.

561
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,040
What did I do?

562
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,040
Now you're a four, but fighting's limited to three!

563
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
I don't know.

564
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,040
Access party now!

565
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,040
What am I doing?

566
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
These three will fight!

567
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,040
But their pals rest!

568
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,040
Simply choose the two!

569
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,040
It's not correct!

570
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,040
You wish to switch!

571
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,040
Mario must always fight though!

572
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
When you succeed at several...

573
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,040
At several action commands in a row!

574
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,040
In ally buff!

575
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,040
The buff is different for each ally in the battle!

576
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,040
Only the bonus for active party members

577
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,040
will be in effect!

578
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,040
Try it out!

579
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,040
Try it with other party members to see what you get!

580
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,040
I can't remember!

581
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,040
Should I go train myself?

582
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,040
Should I go train first?

583
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,040
I'm worried.

584
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,040
If I'm supposed to be level eight.

585
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,040
If I'm supposed to be level eight.

586
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,040
Oh there! Booster's busy right now!

587
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,040
So he can't play!

588
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,040
I'll make some other time where you can try to force your way in!

589
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,040
Alright!

590
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,040
I can do that too!

591
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,040
Oh!

592
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,040
What the heck is that?

593
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
Damn!

594
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,040
Okay! Shit!

595
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,040
I'm sorry! I wasn't familiar with your game!

596
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,040
Yeah!

597
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,040
Orb user!

598
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,040
Hey!

599
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,040
Hey! Senpai! Are you pondering your orb?

600
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,040
Yeah!

601
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,040
Sniff it!

602
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,040
Orb user!

603
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,040
Oh the orb is weak!

604
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,040
Yeah!

605
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,040
What's your special?

606
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
Carorize!

607
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,040
Right!

608
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,040
Like that?

609
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
Oh! It worked!

610
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,040
Ah!

611
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
Mid mushroom!

612
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,040
It's not as good as the greatest mushrooms!

613
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,040
Level up!

614
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,040
Mario reach level eight!

615
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,040
What should I do?

616
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,040
Physical? Magic?

617
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,040
I want to do physical.

618
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,040
Alright!

619
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,040
Alright! Get back here!

620
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,040
Can I do a triple move?

621
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,040
Oh!

622
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,040
I'm testing what it looks like!

623
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Oh!

624
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,040
How nice!

625
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,040
Yay! New friendship move!

626
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,040
It's back here!

627
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,040
Yay!

628
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,040
Was that just a seesaw?

629
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,040
Or could I fight them?

630
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,040
Booster the first?

631
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,040
Jester!

632
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
I don't like the way you look!

633
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,040
You remind me of someone!

634
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,040
Oh shit!

635
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,040
There we go!

636
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,040
Hmm?

637
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,040
Hello!

638
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,040
Thank you!

639
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,040
Oh! I got it!

640
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,040
I got it!

641
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
Ooh!

642
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,040
Are you scared?

643
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,040
Look at that! I'm getting better!

644
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,040
Oh look!

645
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,040
I'll also reach level eight!

646
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,040
You're getting everything in magic!

647
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,040
I'm sorry!

648
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,040
Booster the fourth!

649
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,040
Booster the fifth!

650
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,040
Booster the sixth!

651
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,040
I literally dodged all of them, huh?

652
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,040
What's the big rush?

653
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,040
I'm Booster!

654
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,040
And this is my famous Tower of Amusement!

655
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,040
Normally I welcome visitors to play with me and my sniffsters.

656
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,040
However, a girl fell out of the sky and into my lap recently.

657
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,040
Since then I've been busy keeping her happy and entertained.

658
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,040
I no longer have time to play,

659
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,040
so please enjoy yourself at your own risk, that is.

660
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,040
That's...

661
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,040
Very polite!

662
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,040
Found a flower tab!

663
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,040
Where the fuck do you go?

664
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,040
Please, you're fading from bothering Booster!

665
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,040
Let's work on my timing.

666
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,040
Yeah!

667
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,040
Hold on, I really want to know what that...

668
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,040
What that, you know...

669
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,040
Sorry.

670
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,040
I'm passing through.

671
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,040
I don't know.

672
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,040
Are those Bob-omb goals?

673
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,040
Is it really just...

674
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,040
Is it really just, you know,

675
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,040
seesawing?

676
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,040
Can I set them off?

677
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,040
Try from higher up.

678
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,040
I feel like we can jump higher.

679
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,040
I don't know how to jump higher.

680
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,040
Don't worry about it for now, okay.

681
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,040
I know, he just wants a friend to play seesaw.

682
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,040
Oh, I'm stuck.

683
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,040
This theme is so nice.

684
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,040
Dollocks!

685
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,040
Dolls!

686
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,040
Nice.

687
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,040
P-Jump.

688
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,040
Hell-O-Ice.

689
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,040
P-Jump.

690
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,040
Stop running away, wait a second.

691
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,040
Over here.

692
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,040
I can't jump high enough for this!

693
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,040
This is so rude.

694
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,040
Or can you, can I?

695
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,040
Senpai's.

696
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,040
Senpai's.

697
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,040
Senpai's.

698
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,040
Senpai's.

699
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,040
Senpai's.

700
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,040
I failed.

701
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,040
You still like me even if I failed, right?

702
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,040
Even if I'm a failure, you still like me, right?

703
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,040
Senpai's.

704
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,040
Even if I'm clumsy and pawn, you still love me, right?

705
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,040
Okay, I'm gonna try this again.

706
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,040
Senpai's.

707
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,040
I miss!

708
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,040
Again!

709
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,040
Senpai's.

710
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,040
Senpai, thank you for the two super chat. Do I really have a choice?

711
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,040
Yeah, even though it's the illusion of choice, you have a choice. This might not be the greatest...

712
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,040
Wait, it is the greatest choice. What are you talking about? What are you trying to say?

713
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,040
This is a lot of people.

714
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,040
This is a lot of people!

715
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,040
Senpai's.

716
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,040
Senpai's.

717
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,040
Senpai's.

718
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,040
Senpai's.

719
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,040
There you go!

720
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,040
Yeah, I leveled up!

721
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:48,040
I think most of them are magic or is he more physical?

722
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:55,040
Yeah, he's good with magic I think.

723
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,040
Yeah.

724
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:20,040
Okay, one more time. I can do it.

725
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,040
I'm not even going to say anything.

726
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,040
I'm not even going to say anything.

727
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,040
I'm not even going to say anything.

728
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:46,040
That didn't happen.

729
01:04:46,040 --> 01:05:15,040
Oh shit, I don't have anything.

730
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:31,040
Yeah, you cost too much. Slap him.

731
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:41,040
Kill the arm!

732
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:55,040
Bitch slap!

733
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:59,040
Whiskey no.

734
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:23,040
Attack up, okay.

735
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,040
Yes, I did it!

736
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,040
Pick me up and put pick me up in the storage box.

737
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:37,040
Oh, I don't have enough items.

738
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,040
I swear.

739
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,040
I swear.

740
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:56,040
Okay, which left? This left, right?

741
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:03,040
Wait, maybe? No, no, I can't.

742
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:10,040
Okay, we're on the yellow.

743
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,040
We're slightly to the left on the yellow, correct?

744
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,040
This is where we drop, right?

745
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:29,040
Let's go!

746
01:07:48,040 --> 01:08:11,040
I'll jump next time!

747
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:26,040
I can't be this bad, right?

748
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,040
This is a trap, right?

749
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,040
This can't be, right?

750
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:42,040
I can't be this bad, right?

751
01:08:42,040 --> 01:09:09,040
What the hell?

752
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:19,040
How did that work?

753
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,040
The game really took me on me.

754
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:28,040
Is that a new weapon? Is that a good weapon?

755
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:34,040
Massure. Oh, actually, yeah.

756
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:40,040
Let's just take the win. I'm taking it right now!

757
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:48,040
Nobody can stop me! This is my win!

758
01:09:48,040 --> 01:10:05,040
This is my first time! This is my win!

759
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:25,040
What was that loud noise outside? Check out the booster pass!

760
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:34,040
Oh! Oh my goodness! Senpai, it's raining quite a bit!

761
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:40,040
Hold on. Oh, that's a lot of rain, hold on.

762
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,040
Senpai!

763
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:51,040
Thank you for the 333! You're so good, the game just gave up!

764
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:59,040
Shut up.

765
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:12,040
I know! It might be another storm approaching. I can feel the hell shaking a bit.

766
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:28,040
How did I do that? How did I? How did I do that?

767
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:42,040
It doesn't sound like thunder so far. Let's try this out.

768
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:47,040
Look at me! Bitch slap.

769
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:53,040
Please, no thunder today. Ah, shit. Ah, shit, never mind.

770
01:11:53,040 --> 01:12:00,040
Oh no, that's thunder! That's really loud. Oh no.

771
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:06,040
Oh no, do I have to end early again?

772
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:11,040
Yeah, I can feel the house and I just heard that huge thunder.

773
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:18,040
Mother nature, why?

774
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:23,040
I don't know if you can hear it, Senpai.

775
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:30,040
Oh no.

776
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:37,040
Like, I can literally hear like the glass is shaking and stuff. Oh man.

777
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:43,040
No!

778
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:52,040
No!

779
01:12:52,040 --> 01:13:00,040
It sounded really close, Senpai.

780
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:06,040
You sound...

781
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:11,040
Give me a second Senpai, will you let me see outside?

782
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,040
I'm gonna go see outside and then we'll see if...

783
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:26,040
Wait, shit, I haven't had a save point yet. You're right, I don't have a save point yet.

784
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:31,040
I'm gonna go see and then we're gonna see if we have a save point.

785
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:39,040
I'm gonna go see outside, okay? B-R-B, Senpai!

786
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,040
I'm gonna go see outside.

787
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:36,040
I'm gonna go see outside.

788
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:41,040
I'm gonna go see outside.

789
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:46,040
I'm gonna go see outside.

790
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:51,040
I'm gonna go see outside.

791
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:56,040
I'm gonna go see outside.

792
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,040
It is literally flashing.

793
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,040
Senpai!

794
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:09,040
Thank you for the two, Griffin, and thank you for the two, Boy.

795
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,040
It's pretty bad, it looks like...

796
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:22,040
It looks like, you know, like the fighting scenes in Yu-Yu Hakusho where it's like flashing lights everywhere?

797
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:28,040
It's like, it's like that.

798
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:37,040
Like, it's bad, bad.

799
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:43,040
So, let's go back to Motown.

800
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,040
We'll save.

801
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,040
I'm gonna wait out the weather.

802
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,040
Oh, wait, shit, that's the wrong room.

803
01:15:52,040 --> 01:16:01,040
It's just still far off.

804
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,040
Like if you...

805
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,040
It's pretty bad.

806
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:11,040
Okay, so...

807
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:17,040
Yeah, it looks like someone's having a shonen battle out there, like it's flashing lights everywhere.

808
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,040
I can hear the thunder, like, booming.

809
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,040
So, yeah, I'm gonna...

810
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:28,040
Let's go to Just Chatting, I'll give you guys a little rundown, and then we'll go...

811
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:36,040
I always hate it when this happens!

812
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,040
Okay, so it's always the fireworks, silly.

813
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,040
Yeah, uh...

814
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,040
Senpai!

815
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,040
There's no way there's gonna be fireworks right now.

816
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,040
So, okay, this sucks!

817
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,040
This sucks!

818
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,040
This really sucks!

819
01:16:51,040 --> 01:17:04,040
Normally, my area doesn't get like really bad thunderstorms like this, but recently it's been like pretty, pretty, pretty, you know...

820
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,040
It's happening a lot.

821
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,040
So, let's go over my schedule.

822
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:14,040
If the rain ends quickly, Senpai, I will come back and do a gorilla stream.

823
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,040
If it's not too late.

824
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:24,040
If it's not too late, it will, um...

825
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,040
I will do a gorilla stream.

826
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,040
Senpai!

827
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:37,040
But, like, looking outside right now, it literally is like an epilepsy, like, warning.

828
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:43,040
It's an epilepsy warning, basically.

829
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,040
Thank you, Kisato Daiju, for the five super chat.

830
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:53,040
I mean, I get to play more out in ring, but, like, I want to hang out with Kohai for four plus hours.

831
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,040
Me, too!

832
01:17:54,040 --> 01:18:01,040
But, like, it seriously looks like, you know, like, it's really, it's really bad right now.

833
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:08,040
And I can hear the storm and stuff, so hopefully, um, I'm probably gonna end this stream just for safety reasons.

834
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:13,040
Um, yeah, it's pretty much the Pikachu outside trying to ruin childhoods.

835
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:19,040
Uh, if I don't come back, tomorrow is the...

836
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,040
Okay, we'll speed this up.

837
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:24,040
Uh, tomorrow is the membership only screen, which is SMT Nocturne.

838
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:31,040
If you have membership tier at the member tier, uh, you can join, you can join and watch it.

839
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,040
If you don't, uh, please upgrade.

840
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:43,040
Um, on Saturday, I have a collab with, sort of, my best game, Serenity Cosmica.

841
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:48,040
Uh, we're playing Takoyaki Party, but yeah, uh, I'm a yeet.

842
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,040
I'm a go now.

843
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,040
I'm so sorry, senpai.

844
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:59,040
I really wanted to stay with you more, but holy cow, is, is it, like, going crazy?

845
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:07,040
Okay, so, let me see if there's anyone on to redirect you to.

846
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,040
Little, little, little, little, little, little, little.

847
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,040
Let's do...

848
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,040
Meal?

849
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,040
I don't see anyone on.

850
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,040
Yeah, let's do a meal.

851
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:21,040
And let's save.

852
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,040
So, I'll see you guys again soon, okay?

853
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,040
Scream for Mercy!

854
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,040
Wah!
