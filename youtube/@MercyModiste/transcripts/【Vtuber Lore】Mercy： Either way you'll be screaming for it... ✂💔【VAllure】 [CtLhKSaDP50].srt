1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
It's always one heartbreak after another.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,160
There are people who just love the drama of relationship, but I don't think anyone specifically

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,280
pines for heartbreak.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,520
I mean, I always give my best.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,600
I try to be more than fair as a girlfriend, but sometimes I get nit thinking that somehow

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,800
it's all my fault.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,600
I just can't wrap my head around how that could be possible.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,920
There are times like this where I try to think back to the start of my love life, starting

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,240
with my first love and first loss.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,680
Maybe try to compare and see where I went wrong this time.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,280
It started back in early college.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,800
I was studying to become a fashion designer if you can believe that.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,320
I wasn't as, well, deliciously brazen in my outfit choices as I am now.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,240
A quiet, much-to-overlook girl who never got invited to parties.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,920
Their loss, though I imagine I had more fun sewing, crafting and anything else a grandma

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,040
would do with spare time.

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,760
An old soul people would call me.

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,440
I was content in my own quiet.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,080
That was until I met my first love.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't know what he saw in me, but he was the one to make the first move.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,360
Even before I had the mind addressed to attract the male gaze.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,040
Here I was more of an ominous sheet ghost, whatever the reason.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,400
Here was a man who takes charge where he needs to.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,920
He was a dirty, rabid-looking man who stank a booze and oozed failure and degeneracy.

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,000
In retrospect, in our first meeting, he was a bit more pushy than I'm used to nowadays.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,880
It's best to understand that the pillar of a strong relationship is setting up boundaries

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,080
and it's best to do it as soon as possible.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,000
Putting your foot down, telling your partner what's what is a risk you have to take.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,160
It was because of that I remembered that I always keep my fabric scissors with me.

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,800
When you interact with your partner honestly, if the love is true, they can feel your intent.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,480
That's when the honest, purest part of them comes out.

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,480
My favorite stage in all of my relationships.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,960
It was like he was a completely different person from his introduction.

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,480
He showed me his true self, a part men are taught to hide away, the soft, sweet, vulnerable

35
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
man inside.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,680
I mean, how could I not fall for him?

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't think I have a particular type per se, but a man who expresses his emotions in

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,400
such a delicious way, that's something I couldn't resist.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
I just had to have him.

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,920
I had brought him to an old shed my family owns, the best I could do at the time, but

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,960
together our love can make it a home.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:07,720
You see, good relationships are built on compromise, and I, and compromise I did.

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,560
I gave that man everything, everything he could ever want.

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,040
I bathed him, fed him, cared for him, gave myself to him.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,680
The time we spent, I gave him all I had to give.

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,760
That's what relationships are, I give and take.

47
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,760
You give your all to someone, and you expect them to do the same for you.

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
And you know what he does?

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,680
Just runs away, out of the blue.

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,360
No talking, no indication anything is wrong, just leaves.

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,080
I couldn't understand.

52
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,840
I was high off of my affection for him, and I thought he was the same.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,440
But I had to hold in my sadness.

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
I, for one, am better than leaving without a word.

55
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,880
Relationships, no matter what, should be ended properly.

56
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,280
After all, sometimes relationships don't work out for reasons you don't understand.

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,000
But where there was true love, there can be a lot of fun to be had.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,880
Right?

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,600
Before cutting ties.

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:22,920
After that, it was fling after fling, a new love here and there, all ending the same way.

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,760
I hate having to be the nice one in the relationship.

62
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,640
It can't be my fault.

63
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,520
I guess men will take any chance to abuse your kindness.

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
Now the break of songs and the radio start to make sense, and the sweetest sugars are

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,920
now as bitter as vinegar.

66
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,080
It's times like this when I think I'm about to give up on love entirely, but as they say,

67
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
time heals all wounds.

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
After that, it feels like the very first time.
