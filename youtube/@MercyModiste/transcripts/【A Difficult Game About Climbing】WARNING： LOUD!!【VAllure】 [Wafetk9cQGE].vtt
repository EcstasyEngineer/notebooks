00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
What are you doing?

05:00.000 --> 05:11.860
Waaaaaah!

05:14.860 --> 05:18.940
Waaaaaaaaaah!

05:22.020 --> 05:26.240
Waaaaaah! Welcome!

05:26.240 --> 05:28.580
Snipped at some pies.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.340
Welcome to the stream.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.420
Waaag!

05:34.700 --> 05:35.660
Guess what?

05:37.940 --> 05:43.300
I almost missed stream because I decided to take a nap.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.380
I decided to take a nap.

05:48.380 --> 06:00.380
And I slept through the three alarms that I set up.

06:00.380 --> 06:05.940
So I guess everyone was just really tired.

06:05.940 --> 06:07.780
Anyways, welcome to the stream.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.780
Today we're playing a game called Difficult Game About Climbing.

06:10.780 --> 06:12.500
Why can this man not use his legs?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.500
I don't know.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.500
But we're playing.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.500
Which arm do I release this arm?

06:35.500 --> 06:36.500
Yeah.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
Eee!

06:49.500 --> 06:50.500
Eee!

06:50.500 --> 06:51.500
Oh!

06:51.500 --> 06:52.500
Eee!

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
Waaag!

06:56.500 --> 06:57.500
Eee!

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
Ah!

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
Eee!

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
Eee!

07:01.500 --> 07:02.500
Eee!

07:02.500 --> 07:03.500
Yeah!

07:05.500 --> 07:07.500
Eee!

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
Eee!

07:10.500 --> 07:11.500
Yeah.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
Okay.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.500
We're gaming.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
We're...

07:23.500 --> 07:25.500
We're gaming.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
Wee.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
Move your hand over here.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
Thank you.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
Wee!

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
Wee!

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
Wee game!

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
Wee game it!

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
Yeah!

07:46.500 --> 07:47.500
Wee game it!

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
Game!

07:50.500 --> 07:51.500
Ugh!

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
Yeah!

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
I'm so good at this!

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
Ah-ha-ha!

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
Ah-ha-ha!

07:55.500 --> 07:56.500
Ah-ha-ha!

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
Ah-ha-ha!

07:57.500 --> 07:58.500
Ah-ha!

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
Ah!

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
Eee!

08:02.500 --> 08:03.500
Eh?

08:03.500 --> 08:04.500
Eh?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
Eh?

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
Ah...

08:10.500 --> 08:11.500
Hi.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
It's really high.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.500
Do it.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
Eee!

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Can I?

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
Eee!

08:25.500 --> 08:26.500
Okay!

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
Eh?

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Eh?

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
Eee!

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
Eee!

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
Eee!

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
Eee!

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
Eee!

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
Eee!

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
Is this safe?

08:48.500 --> 08:50.500
Is it safe over here?

08:52.500 --> 08:53.500
Eee!

08:54.500 --> 08:55.500
Eee!

08:56.500 --> 08:59.500
It was not safe at all!

09:00.500 --> 09:01.500
Okay, maybe...

09:02.500 --> 09:03.500
Maybe...

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
No.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.500
Maybe over here is safer.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
Woo!

09:20.500 --> 09:21.500
Eee!

09:23.500 --> 09:24.500
Woo!

09:25.500 --> 09:26.500
Ah-ha-ha!

09:26.500 --> 09:27.500
Ah-ha-ha!

09:30.500 --> 09:31.500
Okay, I got it!

09:31.500 --> 09:32.500
I got it!

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
I got it!

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
I got it, Senpai!

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
Come on, Mouse.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.500
Don't...

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
Don't mess with me!

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
Don't mess with me yet!

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
Yeah!

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
See?

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Okay!

10:06.500 --> 10:07.500
Mister!

10:08.500 --> 10:09.500
Your hands!

10:09.500 --> 10:10.500
Woo!

10:27.500 --> 10:28.500
Tei!

10:28.500 --> 10:29.500
Tei!

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
Tei!

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
Yeah!

10:37.500 --> 10:38.500
Tei!

10:38.500 --> 10:39.500
Yeah!

10:39.500 --> 10:41.500
We got it!

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
Uh...

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
Stay.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.500
Maybe if I pull up a little bit more?

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
Yeah.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.500
Uh...

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
Yeah.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.500
Eh.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.500
Eh.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
Eh.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.500
Hmm.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
Hmm.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
Hmm.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
Hmm.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
Ooh!

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
Flippery.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.500
Huh!

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
Yeah!

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
Baby!

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Yeah!

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
Ah!

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
Come on!

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
Okay.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
That's fine.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.500
Oh, no, I have to get the top top!

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
Come on!

12:02.500 --> 12:03.500
Come on, grippers!

12:07.500 --> 12:08.500
Yeah!

12:11.500 --> 12:13.500
Oh, yeah!

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
Oh, yeah!

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
Oh, yeah!

12:17.500 --> 12:18.500
Oh, yeah!

12:27.500 --> 12:29.500
Okay, maybe that's not a good idea.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.500
Go here.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.500
Yeah.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
Woo!

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:44.500 --> 12:46.500
Is this man, Diogenes?

12:46.500 --> 12:49.500
This philosopher that lives in a pot

12:49.500 --> 12:51.500
and pees on people?

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
Ah!

13:03.500 --> 13:04.500
Woo!

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
I thought I had it.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
Yeah!

13:10.500 --> 13:13.500
Don't fucking do that to me, man!

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
Behold, Kohai!

13:20.500 --> 13:21.500
A man!

13:23.500 --> 13:25.500
That had to change his definition.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.500
Who was that?

13:27.500 --> 13:30.500
That had to change the definition of a man?

13:36.500 --> 13:37.500
Yeah.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.500
Yeah.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.500
Yeah.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.500
Plato, yeah.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.500
Ooh.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
Gamer.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.500
Game.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.500
Yeah.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.500
Oh, yeah.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.500
Oh, yeah!

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
Oh, yeah!

13:55.500 --> 13:56.500
Oh, yeah!

13:56.500 --> 13:57.500
Oh, yeah!

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
Oh, yeah!

14:09.500 --> 14:10.500
Eh?

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
That's...

14:13.500 --> 14:14.500
That's the way.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.500
Point it down.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
Oh!

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
Ah!

14:29.500 --> 14:30.500
Ah!

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
Oh!

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
I made it!

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Yeah.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.500
Yeah.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.500
Oh!

14:50.500 --> 14:51.500
Oh!

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
I'm not gonna lie.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.500
I have no idea...

15:02.500 --> 15:04.500
which way to go.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.500
Am I going down?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.500
Still, or was I supposed to go up?

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
Up?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
Don't tell me it's this one!

15:32.500 --> 15:33.500
Yeah.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
Hmm.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.500
Can I do it?

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
I don't know if I can do it.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
Senpai, I don't know if I can do it!

16:02.500 --> 16:03.500
Hmm.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
I'm so scared!

16:05.500 --> 16:08.500
What if this sign actually does mean death, Senpai?

16:08.500 --> 16:09.500
Senpai!

16:13.500 --> 16:14.500
Ah!

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
Ah!

16:16.500 --> 16:17.500
Ah!

16:30.500 --> 16:31.500
Oi!

16:35.500 --> 16:36.500
Eh!

16:36.500 --> 16:37.500
Eh!

16:37.500 --> 16:38.500
Eh!

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
Eh!

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
Eh!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
My Senpais are...

16:42.500 --> 16:44.500
jerks, and I'm...

16:44.500 --> 16:45.500
never...

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
leaving them...

16:47.500 --> 16:48.500
ever...

16:48.500 --> 16:49.500
again!

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Fuck!

17:01.500 --> 17:03.500
Don't worry, I'm speeding this.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.500
Yeah.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.500
Yeah.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.500
Man!

17:34.500 --> 17:36.500
He just fucking swam through the lives!

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
Dwing!

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
Dwing!

17:45.500 --> 17:46.500
Dwing!

17:46.500 --> 17:47.500
Dwing!

17:51.500 --> 17:54.500
I said the stream was going to be loud, Senpai!

17:54.500 --> 17:57.500
Why didn't you believe me when I said that?

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
Come on.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.500
Yeah.

18:07.500 --> 18:08.500
Ha!

18:08.500 --> 18:09.500
Ha!

18:09.500 --> 18:10.500
Ha!

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
Ha!

18:12.500 --> 18:13.500
Ha!

18:18.500 --> 18:19.500
No!

18:19.500 --> 18:20.500
Use your...

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
use your hands!

18:23.500 --> 18:24.500
Use your hands!

18:29.500 --> 18:30.500
Yeah!

18:30.500 --> 18:31.500
Hands!

18:43.500 --> 18:44.500
Safe.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.500
Safeful.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.500
Hands are getting...

18:55.500 --> 18:58.500
Oh no, I'm gripping the mouse so hard, Senpai!

18:58.500 --> 19:00.500
My hands!

19:00.500 --> 19:01.500
Are crapping!

19:04.500 --> 19:05.500
It's like...

19:05.500 --> 19:06.500
holding scissors.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
Suffer in the not right way.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
Gaming.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
Gaming.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.500
Come on.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
Oh no!

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
You're slipping!

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
You're slipping!

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
How did I do this again?

19:39.500 --> 19:41.500
I was such a gamer earlier.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.500
Yeah.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.500
I should have some of it.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
Eat.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
Eat!

19:58.500 --> 19:59.500
Eat!

19:59.500 --> 20:00.500
Eat!

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
Eat!

20:01.500 --> 20:02.500
Eat!

20:02.500 --> 20:03.500
Eat!

20:03.500 --> 20:04.500
Eat!

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
Eat!

20:05.500 --> 20:06.500
Eat!

20:06.500 --> 20:07.500
Eat!

20:07.500 --> 20:08.500
Eat!

20:08.500 --> 20:09.500
Eat!

20:09.500 --> 20:10.500
Eat!

20:10.500 --> 20:11.500
Eat!

20:11.500 --> 20:12.500
Eat!

20:17.500 --> 20:18.500
Give me a second.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.500
Ah!

20:22.500 --> 20:24.500
My hand!

20:26.500 --> 20:27.500
Okay.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.500
Senpai, my hands are...

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
small.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
This mouse is big!

20:34.500 --> 20:35.500
Okay?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.500
Do you see my dilemma there?

20:38.500 --> 20:39.500
Huh.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.500
You could just reach it just fine last time.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.500
What?

20:48.500 --> 20:51.500
So I have to have like this internal grip on him.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.500
You reached it fine last time.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.500
I can hold it on the keyboard as well.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.500
Hold on.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.500
Hold on.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.500
I can pull up.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.500
Huh.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.500
Oh!

21:24.500 --> 21:25.500
Ah!

21:27.500 --> 21:28.500
Ah!

21:38.500 --> 21:39.500
Alright.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.500
Ugh.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.500
Wait.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
Go Serenities here!

22:04.500 --> 22:06.500
I love Serenity!

22:06.500 --> 22:08.500
Cosmica!

22:10.500 --> 22:11.500
Okay.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.500
Come on.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.500
Come on!

22:17.500 --> 22:18.500
Come on!

22:18.500 --> 22:19.500
Yeah!

22:19.500 --> 22:20.500
Oh yeah!

22:21.500 --> 22:22.500
Haha!

22:24.500 --> 22:25.500
Yeah!

22:25.500 --> 22:26.500
Yeah!

22:29.500 --> 22:31.500
Can I borrow...

22:32.500 --> 22:33.500
Yeah!

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
Oh yeah!

22:36.500 --> 22:37.500
Oh yeah!

22:38.500 --> 22:39.500
Oh yeah!

22:40.500 --> 22:41.500
Stop there!

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
Don't you fall!

22:50.500 --> 22:52.500
This better not break like twice, right?

22:54.500 --> 22:55.500
It just...

22:55.500 --> 22:57.500
It's just there to spook me, right?

22:58.500 --> 22:59.500
Right, Senpai?

23:00.500 --> 23:01.500
Yeah.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.500
Yeah.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.500
Alright.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.500
Yeah.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.500
Yeah.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
Yeah.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
Yeah.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.500
Okay, leap of fate.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
Hey.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.500
Wait.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
Yeah!

23:30.500 --> 23:31.500
Oh yeah!

23:34.500 --> 23:36.500
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:36.500 --> 23:37.500
Senpai!

23:37.500 --> 23:38.500
Senpai!

23:38.500 --> 23:39.500
Senpai!

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
Senpai!

23:41.500 --> 23:42.500
Senpai!

23:42.500 --> 23:43.500
Senpai!

23:43.500 --> 23:44.500
Senpai!

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
I got a bone to pick with you!

23:46.500 --> 23:47.500
Haha!

23:47.500 --> 23:48.500
Haha!

24:08.500 --> 24:10.500
How can I trust...

24:14.500 --> 24:16.500
Oh, there has to be an easier way, right?

24:18.500 --> 24:19.500
Uh...

24:42.500 --> 24:44.500
I didn't realize he slipped.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.500
Why are you like this, Mr. Oh?

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
Why are you like this?

24:52.500 --> 24:53.500
I'm so mad!

24:54.500 --> 24:55.500
Grab.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.500
Grab.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.500
I'm just wondering if I can reach up there.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
Hold on.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.500
Let me just...

25:03.500 --> 25:04.500
Okay.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.500
Okay.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.500
Okay.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.500
Okay.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.500
Okay.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.500
Okay.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.500
Okay.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.500
Okay.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.500
Okay.

25:12.500 --> 25:13.500
Okay.

25:13.500 --> 25:14.500
Okay.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.500
Okay.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.500
Okay.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.500
Okay.

25:17.500 --> 25:18.500
Okay.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.500
Okay.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.500
Okay.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.500
Okay.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.500
Okay.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.500
Okay.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.500
Okay.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
Okay.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.500
Okay.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.500
Good.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.500
Ehhh...

25:31.500 --> 25:32.500
allergen?

25:34.500 --> 25:35.500
Oh.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.500
Okay.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.500
Okay.

25:51.500 --> 25:58.500
It seems too high.

25:58.500 --> 26:08.260
Yeah, you know what, we're not gonna do it, we're not gonna risk it, uh-oh, we're not

26:08.260 --> 26:18.820
gonna risk that, nope, nope, I'm wondering, instead of going in and around, I can somehow

26:18.820 --> 26:23.820
just get over there.

26:23.820 --> 26:28.820
Probably not.

26:28.820 --> 26:33.820
Boogie.

26:33.820 --> 26:40.820
That's it, what's on the other side?

26:40.820 --> 26:45.820
What's on the other side?

26:45.820 --> 26:50.820
Let's just check it out.

26:50.820 --> 26:58.820
Let's just check out what's on the other side.

26:58.820 --> 27:02.820
Literally nothing.

27:02.820 --> 27:18.820
The way he swam was so funny though.

27:18.820 --> 27:24.820
Okay, come on.

27:24.820 --> 27:37.820
And nothing, okay.

27:37.820 --> 27:38.820
What?

27:38.820 --> 27:42.820
He swam straight down?

27:42.820 --> 27:49.820
No.

27:49.820 --> 27:52.820
No.

27:52.820 --> 27:53.820
Can he drown?

27:53.820 --> 28:04.820
No, but I booted up the game a little bit earlier and he can drift away.

28:04.820 --> 28:13.820
Did you know he can drift away in the water?

28:13.820 --> 28:37.820
He can drift away in the water, what the heck, right?

28:37.820 --> 29:06.820
That was my mistake, by the way.

29:06.820 --> 29:07.820
Stay.

29:07.820 --> 29:08.820
Yeah.

29:08.820 --> 29:13.820
Yeah, you got it.

29:13.820 --> 29:30.820
Yeah, you got it.

29:30.820 --> 29:35.820
Yeah, we got this.

29:35.820 --> 29:37.820
Yeah.

29:37.820 --> 29:39.820
Yeah.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.820
Yeah.

29:41.820 --> 29:42.820
What?

29:42.820 --> 29:57.820
Stay, stay, stay.

29:57.820 --> 30:25.820
I trust you.

30:25.820 --> 30:30.820
I trust you, Mr. Bald Naked Man, sir.

30:30.820 --> 30:33.820
I trust you.

30:33.820 --> 30:37.820
Please don't, don't break this trust.

30:37.820 --> 30:39.820
Yeah.

30:39.820 --> 31:05.820
This bald man has a name.

31:05.820 --> 31:10.820
Apparently his diogenes, apparently.

31:10.820 --> 31:23.820
But I know that man doesn't shave, so.

31:23.820 --> 31:29.820
Ooh, that was kind of dangerous.

31:29.820 --> 31:34.820
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

31:34.820 --> 31:56.820
Oh, what, okay.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.820
How many pull-ups can you do, Marcy?

31:58.820 --> 32:10.820
Zero.

32:10.820 --> 32:18.820
Are you sure it's supposed to be this way, Senpai?

32:18.820 --> 32:27.820
It's kind of dangerous.

32:27.820 --> 32:53.820
Oh, that's where it falls, too.

32:53.820 --> 33:09.820
Good to know.

33:09.820 --> 33:34.820
Use your, your, your yowly hands.

33:34.820 --> 33:41.820
Ow.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.820
Yowly hands usually slip rate.

33:44.820 --> 33:51.820
Yeah, with that amount of lube they use.

33:51.820 --> 34:01.820
Yeah.

34:01.820 --> 34:11.820
Yep.

34:11.820 --> 34:27.820
I can't get in the tub, Senpai.

34:27.820 --> 34:30.820
I have no water today.

34:30.820 --> 34:37.820
Apparently the water's going to turn on tomorrow, maybe.

34:37.820 --> 34:47.820
I forgot to grip.

34:47.820 --> 34:57.820
Maybe, I don't know, like, there could be lots of things that happen, right?

34:57.820 --> 35:09.820
Yeah.

35:09.820 --> 35:14.820
I don't know why I decided to climb on this thing when it's literally so easy to reach this.

35:14.820 --> 35:16.820
I was so stupid.

35:16.820 --> 35:20.820
I was so stupid.

35:20.820 --> 35:22.820
What happened to your water?

35:22.820 --> 35:27.820
Some emergency water line thing.

35:27.820 --> 35:47.820
Water thing, so they're like, okay, we got to, like, check for, like, stuff, and I was like, okay.

35:47.820 --> 35:51.820
No shower, like, no water at all, so I'm like, okay.

35:51.820 --> 36:10.820
I've got, like, a ton of water because Papa has just a habit of boiling water and putting them into, like, bottles, so we just have lots.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.820
Interesting, so when was the last time you showered?

36:13.820 --> 36:38.820
Some questions are left to the imagination, yeah?

36:38.820 --> 36:41.820
Did you want the truth?

36:41.820 --> 36:43.820
Did you want the truth?

36:43.820 --> 36:48.820
Some plays?

36:48.820 --> 36:52.820
You wanted the truth?

36:52.820 --> 36:57.820
I haven't showered since debut.

36:57.820 --> 37:00.820
I haven't showered since debut.

37:00.820 --> 37:12.820
Here.

37:12.820 --> 37:26.820
Today was my shower day, and then, well, turns out I'm destined to be stinky today.

37:26.820 --> 37:43.820
I haven't showered for debut because I was like, okay, I'm really stressed, so I'm going to shower for debut, and then I've been preparing a lot of stuff for Senpai, so I haven't had time.

37:43.820 --> 37:51.820
And today I was like, oh, well, I don't have a lot of stuff to prepare today, so I'm just going to have a shower today.

37:51.820 --> 38:00.820
The water, the electrician gas and water place was like, blur away your water!

38:00.820 --> 38:07.820
And I was like, oh, great.

38:07.820 --> 38:14.820
Oh, come on.

38:14.820 --> 38:20.820
Why am I so bad at this suddenly?

38:21.820 --> 38:26.820
Thank you for the tip!

38:26.820 --> 38:28.820
Thank you for the...

38:28.820 --> 38:43.820
I can't read how much that was. Thank you for the tip, Mr. Tony.

38:43.820 --> 38:47.820
I don't think I smell too badly.

38:47.820 --> 38:54.820
Maybe today I do.

38:54.820 --> 39:15.820
Why is this area so much harder than it was like three minutes ago?

39:15.820 --> 39:22.820
Like, I don't think... Okay, okay. Senpai, you're always like, oh, you're so stinky, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

39:22.820 --> 39:33.820
But Senpai...

39:33.820 --> 39:36.820
I don't sweat that much.

39:36.820 --> 39:42.820
Not that much. I do sweat, but like, I don't sweat that much.

39:42.820 --> 39:53.820
Oh, come on.

39:53.820 --> 40:11.820
That's what they all say! Who's all? Who's they? Who's they? What the fuck? Senpai, who is they?

40:11.820 --> 40:23.820
Who the fuck is they?

40:23.820 --> 40:42.820
Mars! Cut off his testicles!

40:53.820 --> 41:03.820
I can't believe my Senpais would cheat on me like this.

41:03.820 --> 41:13.820
I can't believe it. The entire time. I've done this for all of you guys. Look at me. I'm struggling. I'm struggling in this game.

41:13.820 --> 41:24.820
For you, Senpai! And then what's the thing I get? Your dirty fucking cheating ass hole!

41:24.820 --> 41:33.820
I don't smell.

41:33.820 --> 41:39.820
Okay. I don't smell that much.

41:39.820 --> 41:55.820
In fact, science says that it should be, you know, with the person you love, the sweat smells like pheromones, so it should smell like flowers.

41:55.820 --> 42:03.820
Okay.

42:03.820 --> 42:09.820
I'm so mad! I got distracted. I got so angry.

42:09.820 --> 42:20.820
Oh, are you sweating? A little bit.

42:20.820 --> 42:37.820
I got distracted and angry. I was mad and angry and mad and pissed!

42:37.820 --> 42:53.820
Anyways, I don't sweat. So, see, sweat that much. So, only once in a while does my pits stink, and you're going to be so shocked about this Senpai.

42:53.820 --> 43:06.820
For some reason, my feet don't sweat, and I don't know why.

43:06.820 --> 43:19.820
Are they okay? I don't know. Maybe it's just naturally dry.

43:19.820 --> 43:27.820
Here is the areas that I do sweat a little bit more than usual.

43:27.820 --> 43:38.820
I sweat more around my neck.

43:38.820 --> 43:54.820
And I sweat more around my lower back.

43:54.820 --> 44:07.820
But yeah, it's mostly my neck.

44:07.820 --> 44:16.820
Like the back of my neck gets really sweaty.

44:16.820 --> 44:25.820
My pits can get sweaty.

44:25.820 --> 44:36.820
And, oh yeah, it's mostly my neck. I always have to apply deodorant there.

44:46.820 --> 44:57.820
Your hair long or short?

44:57.820 --> 45:15.820
Senpai, do you have eyes? It's long.

45:15.820 --> 45:44.820
Like you seem bad to me. Are we looking at the same characters? I'm right here Senpai! You know what the scissors in the hair? Hello? Did you forget what I looked like? Are you cheating? Are you such a cheating cheater that you forgot what I looked like?

45:44.820 --> 46:06.820
I don't know what I looked like.

46:06.820 --> 46:19.820
I was hoping I could get that to work.

46:19.820 --> 46:48.820
I was going to say something bad, but I remember that YouTube will hate bad words.

46:48.820 --> 47:14.820
Are you going to say the C word? No! I was going to say the S word.

47:14.820 --> 47:39.820
Yeah, new tech. New tech found.

47:39.820 --> 48:01.820
Oh, Azura! Thank you for the raid! Azura! Azura! Azura!

48:01.820 --> 48:10.820
Okay, I saw Senpai say I should be more up here. That I have bigger swing, right?

48:10.820 --> 48:20.820
Welcome Raiders! Welcome to the stream! We are playing a very difficult game, a climbing game.

48:20.820 --> 48:31.820
You'll hear lots of screams from me.

48:31.820 --> 49:00.820
I don't know Senpai, this seems a little far. Are you sure this is where I should be? Like here, maybe here? This looks safer.

49:02.820 --> 49:15.820
I don't know. Okay, maybe I should be up more.

49:15.820 --> 49:27.820
Are you here? Okay.

49:46.820 --> 50:05.820
Azura, you're going to cramp your hand! Don't do this!

50:05.820 --> 50:15.820
Oh, come on. Fine, just use- there you go.

50:15.820 --> 50:34.820
Efficiency. I take it back.

50:34.820 --> 50:54.820
I take it back when I said.

50:54.820 --> 51:14.820
Oh, man, I'm so not a gamer. You know, at the beginning of the game, where I was like, yeah, I'm gaming. I'm gaming, bros. I'm gaming Senpai. That was a lie.

51:14.820 --> 51:34.820
Okay, I was in denial of my true strength. You know, I thought I had the ability, but turns out my ability that I had was a lie and that I was strongly overcompensating for my skills.

51:34.820 --> 51:41.820
I thought I was a gamer. I thought I was. You know what? I lied. I lied. I'm not a gamer at all. You guys can't punish me for this.

51:41.820 --> 51:50.820
My Senpais can't punish me for not being able to game, okay? Look at me. Look at me. This is because my hands are sweaty. Yeah, it's totally because my hands are sweaty.

51:50.820 --> 52:18.820
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

52:18.820 --> 52:40.820
So does his legs not work now? This man's leg just doesn't work. All we can do is rely on these arms that seem to have the power of, of like a thousand who's like, who's able to hold on for, for dear life for such a long time.

52:41.820 --> 52:43.820
Yeah.

52:44.820 --> 52:46.820
Yeah.

52:57.820 --> 52:59.820
Ah.

52:59.820 --> 53:01.820
Ah.

53:06.820 --> 53:08.820
Just grab on, man.

53:11.820 --> 53:13.820
Well, yeah. Hiya.

53:24.820 --> 53:28.820
Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya.

53:30.820 --> 53:32.820
esperar

53:36.820 --> 53:38.820
Yeah.

53:40.820 --> 53:42.820
Meow.

53:43.820 --> 53:47.820
Hi. Hi.

53:59.820 --> 54:25.820
No, I want to be higher, right?

54:25.820 --> 54:43.820
Maybe a bit higher?

54:43.820 --> 54:51.820
Oh, maybe I should be more to the edge.

54:51.820 --> 55:09.820
Oh, he slips.

55:09.820 --> 55:24.820
I forgot he slips.

55:24.820 --> 55:49.820
I got spooked.

55:49.820 --> 56:05.820
Stop counting my falls!

56:05.820 --> 56:30.820
I don't need to know the amount of times I fail. I just need to know the amount of times I win.

56:30.820 --> 56:53.820
I know this is the beginning.

56:53.820 --> 57:17.820
Stop bullying me!

57:17.820 --> 57:19.820
Got it.

57:47.820 --> 58:15.820
There we go.

58:15.820 --> 58:37.820
There we go.

58:37.820 --> 58:53.820
It's fun! Slippery! Slippery!

58:54.820 --> 58:59.820
Hmm.

58:59.820 --> 59:11.820
Hmm.

59:11.820 --> 59:32.820
Yeah!

59:32.820 --> 59:56.820
This man just goes, brrr, cold.

59:56.820 --> 01:00:25.820
Oh, brrr.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:54.820
Oh, brrr.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:19.820
Oh, brrr.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:48.820
This is a mean game. This is a rain game. I know it's a rain game. My man does not feel that great.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:59.820
A hard but not impossible game is what they said. And I wanted to show off to Senpai that I could probably do it.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:11.820
Right now I'm starting to question my life choices.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:35.820
Senpai's must be better gamers than me.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:55.820
Shut up, Amy!

01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:13.820
Easy. Easy your way.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:24.820
I don't like that area. That area sucks. You know what? That sucks. That sucks balls. Okay?

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:53.820
I can't believe I fell at that part.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:04:22.820
Eh, eh, wah, wah, wah. Fuck you. Fuck this bullshit.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:29.820
No.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:05:09.820
Hmm.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:31.820
Hmm. Focus. Laser focus.

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:52.820
Laser focus.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:06:04.820
Hmm.

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:21.820
Maybe I need my hand like here.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:43.820
Nyeh.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:07:12.820
Nyeh.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:39.820
Nyeh.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:08:04.820
Nyeh.

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:19.820
Nyeh.

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:48.820
Nyeh.

01:08:49.820 --> 01:09:06.820
Nyeh.

01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:28.820
Nyeh.

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:48.820
Nyeh.

01:09:48.820 --> 01:10:03.820
Nyeh.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:19.820
Shut up. Shut up Senpai.

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:44.820
Okay, one handed gameplay.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:11:06.820
And a drink tea.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:35.820
What do you think it is? By the way, it's an apple cinnamon. Apple cinnamon tea.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:54.820
Oh yeah.

01:11:54.820 --> 01:12:04.820
Maybe I should have been here.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:11.820
Just need to be brave.

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.820
I'm not brave.

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:36.820
Give me a second.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:13:02.820
Nyeh.

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:19.820
Nyeh.

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:48.820
Senpai, you're not tired of me, right? You still love me, right? Even though I'm a bad gamer?

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:58.820
Nyeh.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:22.820
Nyeh.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:36.820
I don't even know how physics work.

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:46.820
There's some games I'm good at you. I bet.

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:57.820
Like rock, paper, scissors maybe?

01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:10.820
Visual novels are like, it's gameplay but it's not like gameplay, you know?

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:30.820
I can guess I'm okay at detective games and puzzle games, sort of.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:50.820
Nyeh.

01:15:50.820 --> 01:16:19.820
Seriously, can I get these arms? How does this man not just buff in the arms?

01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:47.820
Nessie. Oh yeah.

01:16:47.820 --> 01:17:05.820
Was it here? Or did I need to go down here? I can't remember.

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:32.820
Nyeh.

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:48.820
Hold on, I need to position this. That didn't count as a fall, I caught my way down.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:18:08.820
Okay, maybe that one did.

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:34.820
Senpai, this hurts my hand too much. I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:55.820
Because this hurts my hand a lot. I don't know if it's gonna work.

01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:22.820
This is kind of harder.

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:51.820
This is less precise.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:20:10.820
Just that my hand really hurt with the mouse. That's a little hard. I'll see what we can do.

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:35.820
He's dangling. This is harder.

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:43.820
It doesn't hurt my hand as much. This is gonna be a new learning curve.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:28.820
A new learning curve, but it doesn't hurt my hand as much. Thank you for the dollar you do a day in white.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:40.820
Oh gosh, this is so hard to control for the controller. I know it's technically easier on mouse, but...

01:21:40.820 --> 01:22:03.820
Mercy's hand's hurt.

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:39.820
I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

01:22:40.820 --> 01:23:09.820
This is so hard to control the hands. Look how much more flingy he is.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:14.820
Oh no!

01:23:40.820 --> 01:24:09.820
I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:39.820
I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

01:24:40.820 --> 01:25:09.820
No, no, no, I have no idea.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:39.820
I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:55.820
Learning the controller is so hard.

01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:13.820
At least less hand pain, yeah. Oh my goodness.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:24.820
Such a learning curve. I should definitely invest in a smaller mouse. What the heck? Why did I buy such a big, enormous thing?

01:26:43.820 --> 01:27:12.820
I don't know why I did that. What mouse? It's a HyperX. I bought it because it was pink. It actually kind of sucks, because it always disconnects.

01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:35.820
Oh, come on.

01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:40.820
Oh no!

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:24.820
Oh, it's not a wireless mouse. The mouse I got is a wired mouse. It disconnects all the time and I always have to go to the back of the PC and grab it because it sucks.

01:28:35.820 --> 01:29:04.820
Oh, come on.

01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:14.820
This man swings too much.

01:29:35.820 --> 01:30:04.820
Let's try this part with the mouse instead.

01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:28.820
Oh, come on.

01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:44.820
Maybe try a different USB port. All my USB ports are taken, so there's only one place left for it.

01:30:44.820 --> 01:31:03.820
When I had my other mouse... I'm going back to mouse style. I'm sorry. It was just too hard.

01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:14.820
When I had my other mouse, it worked just fine. Same ports, everything. It's just this HyperX1 freaking sucks.

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:48.820
Oh, come on.

01:31:48.820 --> 01:32:09.820
Oh, come on.

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:20.820
Thank you for the 420 King Chucky.

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:31.820
This is my Zatsu. Sorry, I'm just like super focused. Hyper, hyper, hyper focused.

01:32:50.820 --> 01:33:19.820
I'm going back to the mouse. It hurts me, but I can control it better.

01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:35.820
That's it. I'm going to put a new mouse on my list. I was like, yeah, I wanted to be pink. I wanted it to be pink and cute and adorable so it can match all the rest of my stuff.

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:54.820
Oh, it sucks. Oh, whatever. I feel like...

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:32.820
Can I grab with Q? Like this? I guess this works.

01:34:32.820 --> 01:35:01.820
Okay, well, this works. I just have to remember which key is which.

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:29.820
I have to claw it. So that's good. Thank you.

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:58.820
Okay.

01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:23.820
Why is this getting harder? Maybe it's because I'm getting more frustrated.

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:39.820
My favorite color is purple. I'm trying to get stuff to match purple and white, right? I guess aesthetics is important, in my opinion. I feel like if things around me are the colors that make me happy and I can be happy.

01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:47.820
That's why I have all my dog cages to be super cute and pink and adorable. I painted them all cute colors.

01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:20.820
Maybe here?

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:55.820
Are you not allowed to customize? You know how I said I like color coordination senpai? I like all my things to be color coordinated. Understood?

01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:37.820
Yeah.

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:49.820
Just got to deal with the carpal tunnel.

01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:59.820
Bitch.

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:29.820
Yeah.

01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:59.820
Senpai, this part is hard. And this is the beginning.

01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:39.820
I want to be a gamer, but I suck at gaming.

01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:50.820
Son of a slut!

01:40:50.820 --> 01:41:06.820
I'm sorry for using bad words.

01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:26.820
Don't worry.

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:36.820
Don't worry. I soundproofed everything. So, senpai. The neighbors won't normally hear me. Normally.

01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:24.820
I don't mind a little back seating, but I really don't know where to go how to get to this part.

01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:46.820
Do I swing here?

01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:56.820
Do I swing with both arms? Like this? This?

01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:36.820
Hmm. Kind of scary.

01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:46.820
Do-do-do.

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:31.820
I don't know.

01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:51.820
You slipped down more. Maybe I'm just stupid?

01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:30.820
Instead of flipping, you mean like, hold on. Maybe you're on to something, senpai.

01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:40.820
No, no, no, no!

01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:20.820
I'm not a gamer. That's it. I relinquish that title for someone more worthy of such a title.

01:46:50.820 --> 01:47:06.820
I'm not a gamer.

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:16.820
Yep.

01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:45.820
Okay.

01:47:45.820 --> 01:48:07.820
Now do the same as before, but let go slightly early so your body won't flip.

01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:33.820
Why does everyone get stuck at the same part every time? Well, maybe that part is hard, senpai.

01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:45.820
At this point, I'm not even watching it anymore. I'm just like, okay, well, this time I've already got a pattern sort of how to like do this.

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:56.820
Just this one part. One part. It gets harder. I know. But this one part, I just want to get past it. I just want to get past this one part.

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:28.820
It's deft doable, but like maybe I just don't know the trick to it, you know?

01:49:46.820 --> 01:50:05.820
We never lose, we never give up. This is what... This is what persistence is. Oh, shit. Ah, fuck.

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:25.820
Tenacity, persistence. I don't know what other words there are. I don't have a thesaurus on me.

01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:54.820
Is it possible to head first instead of swinging? Honestly, I have no idea.

01:50:54.820 --> 01:51:12.820
Like, I would love to... I feel like I'm gonna flip, so I just... I don't know. I don't know, senpai. I don't know.

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:15.820
That one goes back down to the beginning.

01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:44.820
I want to get closer but I'm also kind of worried that I won't be able to swing far enough.

01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:48.820
Hmm?

01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:06.820
I just made him do a weird shimmy! I just made him do the Stingin' Nansen!

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:09.820
Attarashi Gakkou!

01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:14.820
Otona Blue.

01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:16.820
Hup.

01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:21.820
Alright.

01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:40.820
Hmm. This part's hard. I'm... I don't know. Maybe I need to watch a video of someone doing it?

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:49.820
But I feel like that's cheating. I feel like that's cheating. And I'm not a cheater. I'm a quitter, but not a cheater!

01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:55.820
I'm like, you guys! And I'm like, senpai's! Cheater, cheating.

01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:18.820
Oh, shit.

01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:21.820
Hmm.

01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:22.820
Oh.

01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:24.820
Hup.

01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:26.820
Hup.

01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:29.820
Hup.

01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:40.820
Hup.

01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:44.820
Hup.

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:47.820
Hup.

01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:54.820
Hup.

01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:14.820
I don't know which rock it is that I should... Like, I can't tell if I should be, like, trying this rock or this rock.

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:23.820
Hup.

01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.820
Hup.

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.820
Hup.

01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:35.820
Hup.

01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:38.820
Hup.

01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:44.820
Hup.

01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:48.820
Buh!

01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:53.820
Hup.

01:54:58.820 --> 01:54:59.820
Hup!

01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:00.820
Hup!

01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:06.820
He didn't hold on.

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.820
Hup.

01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:26.820
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I almost had it and then I failed.

01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:27.820
Hup.

01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:32.820
Hup.

01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:37.820
Hup.

01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:40.820
Hup.

01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:43.820
Hup.

01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:49.820
I want such a hard area. I don't know why it's such a hard area.

01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:52.820
I know why.

01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:54.820
Game Devs Evil.

01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:59.820
Why did I decide to play this game?

01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:03.820
How many hours in? I'm nearly two hours in and I suck!

01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:07.820
I recognize my weaknesses, Senpai. Do you recognize your weaknesses?

01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:10.820
My weakness includes...

01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:16.820
My weakness includes impatience!

01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:21.820
But at the same time, I'm a little stubborn.

01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:34.820
Hup.

01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:43.820
There we go.

01:56:43.820 --> 01:57:12.300
I'm your greatest weakness, Senpai!

01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:19.300
I think it was here.

01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:29.380
So, uh, I didn't get it.

01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:35.940
I didn't get it.

01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:36.940
I'm back!

01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:38.340
Did Mercy make it to the top?

01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:41.780
No, we're back at the bottom, and now, well, we're in the bottom still.

01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:56.380
Oh, he always slips there.

01:57:56.380 --> 01:58:00.580
I intercept back.

01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:01.580
We got this.

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:02.580
Yeah, we got this.

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.580
We still winning.

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:06.700
We're in the grind mindset.

01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:22.420
Um, every day your life is, uh, uh, is a power tool made to rock?

01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:24.580
I don't fucking know.

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:38.260
Oh, something about Northern Lion.

01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:54.140
I mean, MC's bald, yeah.

01:58:54.140 --> 01:59:15.180
Sometimes I look at life and I go, what would, what would this bald man Northern Lion would

01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:16.180
say?

01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:32.340
And I force it on to other people.

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:53.820
Something involving hammers, probably, and then I start getting angry and then maybe

01:59:53.820 --> 02:00:03.260
I'll use the hammers on Senpai.

02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:04.260
Is it this?

02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.340
I can't remember which rock it was.

02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:08.500
Was it this rock?

02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:22.140
Which rock did I vibe with Senpai?

02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:25.900
I couldn't remember which rock I vibe with.

02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:26.900
This one?

02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:29.020
Is it this rock that I vibe with?

02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:37.060
This one right here on the little corner, this little sliver?

02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:38.380
Or did I go the one up?

02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:39.380
No, go up.

02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:40.380
Okay.

02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:50.420
This was the one that I, I vibe with.

02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:51.700
Bottom of the middle rock.

02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:58.980
Was it this bottom of the middle rock that I vibe with?

02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:01.580
This bottom.

02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:02.580
This bottom.

02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:17.540
And I'm not talking about, like, you know, a bit higher.

02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:20.100
What about here was the vibe?

02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:21.100
Alright.

02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:30.100
That was not the vibe.

02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:33.660
Me and you?

02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:43.860
Well, I'm at the bottom here.

02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:47.700
Good check failed.

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:48.700
Every time.

02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:50.900
I just don't like it.

02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:55.900
It doesn't mesh with my karma.

02:01:55.900 --> 02:02:04.380
It just doesn't mesh with my karma Senpai.

02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:18.820
That area is full of negative energy.

02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:44.420
Really a Scorpio.

02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:49.020
I don't know what else they say.

02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:50.020
Oh man.

02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:51.020
What if I get a rock?

02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:55.700
I have like some, some, some like, some like rocks.

02:02:55.700 --> 02:03:00.380
And then what if I get a rock and then I pray to that rock and then be like, yes, let's

02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:09.700
meditate on this rock so we can make this jump.

02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:49.180
I swung.

02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:50.180
Was it not hard?

02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:51.180
Air guitar.

02:03:51.180 --> 02:04:03.620
I don't know what I forgot what guitar sounds like because I don't really listen to music.

02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:16.820
So in my mind, when you said like, oh, you air guitar down, I was like, air banjo, it's

02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:17.820
dead.

02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:29.820
It's like I'm in here or something.

02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:59.340
Oh, unless we're talking about the guitar, is it a guitar?

02:05:00.340 --> 02:05:01.980
I've been watching Yu Yu Hakusho.

02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:04.580
So I have Yu Yu Hakusho brain rot right now.

02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:15.260
So the sound effect.

02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:16.260
Something happens.

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:25.260
Do you remember Senpai?

02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:43.540
Right now I'm on the arc where the arc following what's his face's plan to open the kick kai

02:05:43.540 --> 02:06:07.980
barrier kick kai means barrier.

02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:08.980
Yeah.

02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:09.980
Right now we have.

02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:11.820
Oh my gosh.

02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:12.820
Close your ears.

02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:17.980
Oh, close your ears right now.

02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:24.100
Currently demon guy was like, I'm hungry, I can't take it anymore.

02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:25.100
And that's where I'm at.

02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:26.100
That's it.

02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:27.100
That's the part I'm at.

02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:52.460
Oh, I'm still scared Senpai.

02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:53.460
I'm still scared.

02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:55.500
I don't actually remember how I did it.

02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:57.500
I don't remember how I did it.

02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:20.500
Just do it.

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:30.500
Give me a second, let me test something.

02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:36.500
Okay, I definitely swing back if I let go there.

02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:40.500
I have to let go as I'm swinging.

02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:47.500
Senpai!

02:07:47.500 --> 02:08:02.500
We did it!

02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:08.500
Wow!

02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:24.500
Huh, now I'm stuck.

02:08:54.500 --> 02:09:23.500
We live here now.

02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:26.500
I'm sweating from my neck.

02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:38.500
I can feel the sweat dripping down my neck right now.

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:40.500
This is where we live now.

02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:56.500
We're home now.

02:09:56.500 --> 02:10:21.500
This is our rock.

02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:45.500
This is where we live now.

02:10:45.500 --> 02:11:14.500
This is where we live now.

02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:39.500
This is where we live now.

02:11:39.500 --> 02:12:07.500
This is where we live now.

02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:08.500
That's all that mattered.

02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:15.500
We peaked once.

02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:23.500
We peaked once.

02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:29.500
I was so close Senpai.

02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:41.500
I was so close.

02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:46.500
I didn't know I was slip and slide right there.

02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:52.500
My slip and slide days.

02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:55.500
I assume you're already familiar with getting over it.

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:58.500
Yeah, and guess what?

02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.500
I got over it.

02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:02.500
Actually, I didn't get over it.

02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:20.500
I got to the one area with all the curls and then I just gave up there.

02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:22.500
I can't believe there was a slide there.

02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:27.500
I was like, okay, just swing and then I...

02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:29.500
I was like, okay, well, grab onto that area.

02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:31.500
It'll be fine.

02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:39.500
Slip and slide, baby.

02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:40.500
Did you get to the anvil?

02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:42.500
I think I got to the anvil.

02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:48.500
I'm not sure.

02:13:48.500 --> 02:14:10.500
I made it to peak and then I fell off.

02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:17.500
That's how it goes, right?

02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:44.500
I fell off, literally.

02:14:44.500 --> 02:15:01.500
We can peak again.

02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:02.500
I gave up.

02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:05.500
I can't believe you would have that vocabulary in you, Mercy Modest.

02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:07.500
Well, guess what?

02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:08.500
I do.

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:12.500
I'm a quitter, but not a cheater.

02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:18.500
Except for when cheating feels good in games.

02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:20.500
Do you know Black Clover?

02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:22.500
Does anyone know Black Clover?

02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:24.500
I'm going to give you a spoiler.

02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:27.500
When Asta, they were cheating in this tournament thing

02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:31.500
and then Asta was like, you weren't cheating?

02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:33.500
Why didn't you tell me I wanted to cheat, too?

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:44.500
And I felt that.

02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:46.500
No, we're not cheating that way.

02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:51.500
We're talking about cheating in games, you know?

02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:57.500
The only cheaters I know is you, Senpai.

02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:05.500
That's why you have to cut off your fingers sometimes.

02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:16.500
Oh my gosh, do not make this about NTR.

02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:29.500
It's like you guys have brain rot.

02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:31.500
It's like some Senpais have brain rot for NTR

02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:38.500
and that's all they can think about.

02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:40.500
You know what NTR I think about?

02:16:40.500 --> 02:17:04.500
New times, Romans.

02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:11.500
I'm just saying.

02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:13.500
I'm just saying.

02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:15.500
I don't want questions about that anymore.

02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:17.500
I don't want questions about that.

02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:19.500
I want people to assume anything.

02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:26.500
Why? Because I only love my Senpais.

02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:28.500
New times, Romans, good.

02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:43.500
It's a good font.

02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:44.500
It's a good font.

02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:55.500
I promise Senpais that I only have Senpai in my heart.

02:17:55.500 --> 02:18:07.500
And maybe Serenity, sorry.

02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:27.500
Serenity in my gym mate, sorry.

02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:47.500
See the power of my gen mates in Serenity.

02:18:47.500 --> 02:19:16.500
Serenity in my gym mate.

02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:29.500
I feel like...

02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:49.500
Can we get higher before?

02:19:49.500 --> 02:20:04.500
I slept.

02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:17.500
I slept. That was scary.

02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:30.500
By the power of Serenity and my gen mates Azra, Imi, Isi, Shibi, Strony.

02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:54.500
I will make it.

02:20:54.500 --> 02:21:22.500
Oh no, my mouse is so sweaty.

02:21:22.500 --> 02:21:42.500
My hands are making me sweat.

02:21:42.500 --> 02:22:08.500
My hands are making me sweat.

02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:24.500
My hands are making me sweat.

02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:40.500
I did it, I did it, I did it.

02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:45.500
My gamer license has been reinstated.

02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:53.500
I made progress but now my hands are really sweaty.

02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:57.500
I'm super sweaty now.

02:22:57.500 --> 02:23:11.500
I might be a real gamer because of how sweaty I am.

02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:13.500
I think I just flowed here for a little bit.

02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:15.500
Look at my little oasis.

02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:17.500
Yeah.

02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:20.500
Yeah, my little oasis with my little waterfall.

02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:23.500
I got these beautiful leaves.

02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:25.500
This wonderful ambience.

02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:27.500
Do you have any gamer gloves?

02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:43.500
No.

02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:45.500
We live here now.

02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:54.500
Why would we want to go more?

02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:57.500
I don't normally game this hard.

02:23:57.500 --> 02:23:59.500
Oh, the carpal tunnel though.

02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:09.500
I feel it in my fingies.

02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:11.500
I really feel it.

02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:14.500
It's so sore now.

02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:17.500
Can I save here?

02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:23.500
Am I allowed to save or does it start at the beginning again?

02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:33.500
I don't know.

02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:41.500
Carpal tunnel.

02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:43.500
I'm so sweaty now.

02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:54.500
My neck feels like a waterfall.

02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:57.500
Where is the bath water?

02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:02.500
My bath is kind of small.

02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:28.500
How do we get past here?

02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:34.500
All of the roots, just be careful.

02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:39.500
This is kind of scary.

02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:48.500
These roots?

02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:51.500
I don't feel safe out of my oasis.

02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:57.500
I'm going back to my oasis.

02:25:57.500 --> 02:26:03.500
I don't feel safe outside of my oasis.

02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:06.500
That area was so dark.

02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:12.500
I was like, this is an area that's dangerous.

02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:22.500
We live here now.

02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:29.500
This is where we live.

02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:33.500
This oasis probably has fish, right?

02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:43.500
We'll fish together some pie.

02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:45.500
We can eat the leaves.

02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:54.500
These are good nutritious leaves.

02:26:54.500 --> 02:27:00.500
You can probably be free in this area without your cages.

02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:08.500
Where else would you go?

02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:14.500
Why would you leave my oasis?

02:27:14.500 --> 02:27:24.500
You can always go down.

02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:34.500
I worked really hard to get here.

02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:44.500
I'm going back to my oasis.

02:27:44.500 --> 02:28:10.500
I'm going back to my oasis.

02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:35.500
I'm going back to my oasis.

02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:48.500
I'm going back to my oasis.

02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:52.500
This is where I live now.

02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:56.500
We all live here.

02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:11.500
We collect berries and go collecting berries.

02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:15.500
This area looks dangerous.

02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:25.500
I'm kind of scared of it.

02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:49.500
How's the wi-fi here? I don't know. Check it.

02:29:49.500 --> 02:30:12.500
I think it's good.

02:30:12.500 --> 02:30:20.500
We live here now.

02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:30.500
Do I have to go for bush to bush?

02:30:50.500 --> 02:31:12.500
How do I get bush to bush?

02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:28.500
Maybe this bush and then go to that bush.

02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:32.500
Maybe that bush and we swing.

02:31:32.500 --> 02:31:34.500
I was already at that bush.

02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:36.500
Is that the bush I was supposed to go to?

02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:12.500
I don't know if I can reach that high.

02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:22.500
I don't know if I can reach that high.

02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:38.500
I don't know if I can reach that high.

02:32:38.500 --> 02:33:07.500
I'm stuck here.

02:33:07.500 --> 02:33:09.500
We live here forever.

02:33:09.500 --> 02:33:12.500
Why do we want to move anyways?

02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:18.500
What is the climb?

02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:42.500
No!

02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:54.500
Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!

02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:56.500
Senpai!

02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:06.500
Shit!

02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:16.500
Is it just me or are these not easy to reach?

02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:55.500
Is it just me or are these not easy to reach?

02:34:55.500 --> 02:35:05.500
Is this going to break?

02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:35.500
I'm stuck here.

02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:45.500
Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!

02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:55.500
Senpai, I'm a gamer!

02:35:55.500 --> 02:36:07.500
This looks dangerous.

02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:17.500
I don't think I'm ready for this yet.

02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:35.500
Water! Water safe! Water!

02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:45.500
This is scary Senpai!

02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:51.500
This part is a part where everybody drops, don't they?

02:36:51.500 --> 02:37:05.500
Oh god.

02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:41.500
I lost my home!

02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:50.500
Look, he just floats.

02:37:50.500 --> 02:38:18.500
Senpai, we're homeless again!

02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:23.500
Now the sea only tastes like salt.

02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:37.500
Where is that my tears?

02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:40.500
We live here now.

02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:42.500
That was it.

02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:43.500
I knew it.

02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:46.500
That sign was dangerous and I knew it and we all knew it.

02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:54.500
I'm too tired for this now.

02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:56.500
We rage quit, yeah.

02:38:56.500 --> 02:38:58.500
Yeah, we rage.

02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:05.500
We rage quit.

02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:08.500
We live in a society.

02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:15.500
We live in a society where bald men who can't use their legs

02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:18.500
can't even find a home.

02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:25.500
The housing market is terrible.

02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:27.500
I made it to peak.

02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:30.500
I made it to our little oasis.

02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:34.500
I went past our little oasis because I wanted more.

02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:37.500
I should have just been happy with what I had.

02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:56.500
I just became so greedy.

02:39:56.500 --> 02:40:03.500
We should have just lived in the oasis.

02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:12.500
We were homeowners.

02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:16.500
I don't know how long we were homeowners, but I wanted more.

02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:18.500
The Home Owners Association.

02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:23.500
I wanted to be the president of the Home Owners Association.

02:40:23.500 --> 02:40:26.500
And then we just, we failed.

02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:29.500
We failed.

02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:31.500
I'm so sad.

02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:33.500
So sad, Senpai.

02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:35.500
But what did we learn from that?

02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:53.500
We learned that the power of friendship is the most powerful thing.

02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:58.500
We wanted a house in this economy.

02:40:58.500 --> 02:41:06.500
Heck, I was even, heck, I was even, I was even going to pay my mortgage.

02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:14.500
My mortgage with the climb.

02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:15.500
Are we only friends to Yuka?

02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:17.500
I know.

02:41:17.500 --> 02:41:21.500
My Senpais are in a loving relationship with me.

02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:25.500
My friendship is with my girls.

02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:31.500
Girls.

02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:34.500
Well, thank you.

02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:38.500
Set up for the 420.

02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:39.500
I really appreciate it.

02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:40.500
You did your best.

02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:42.500
Thank you.

02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:48.500
Thank you so much.

02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:50.500
We have the down payment.

02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:54.500
And then we have to pay the principal.

02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:57.500
And then we have to fight the other homeowners.

02:41:57.500 --> 02:42:03.500
We have to fight the businesses that want to convert the entire area into a BNB,

02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:14.500
a BNB enterprise, an Airbnb enterprise.

02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:23.500
Man, homeownership's rough.

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:32.500
Corporal.

02:42:32.500 --> 02:42:36.500
Corporal's always coming in, gentrifying the place.

02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:39.500
The homeowners association hates me.

02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:41.500
They hate me because I wear an eye patch.

02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:48.500
That's it, right?

02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:50.500
Although that is my dream, though.

02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:52.500
I really do want to own my own place.

02:42:52.500 --> 02:43:05.500
So I can have more freedom.

02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:08.500
They won't even let me.

02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:17.500
The homeowners association won't even let me have pink curtains.

02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:18.500
I don't know.

02:43:18.500 --> 02:43:25.500
Is those fancy apartments and flats?

02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:29.500
Do they have homeowners associations or whatever?

02:43:29.500 --> 02:43:35.500
Where they're like, you can't have colorful curtains.

02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:45.500
Because then it brings the property down.

02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:47.500
Sacrilege, I know.

02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:49.500
I want my pink curtains.

02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:51.500
Actually, my curtains are kind of like an off-white,

02:43:51.500 --> 02:43:55.500
but they're like sheer and they look very ethereal.

02:43:55.500 --> 02:44:04.500
Like a wedding dress, you know?

02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:06.500
Will there be a yard to play in?

02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:07.500
I don't know.

02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:10.500
I don't like, I don't really like taking care of yards.

02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:13.500
I don't like mowing, you know?

02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:29.500
I don't like mowing.

02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:36.500
Tempies won't take care of the mowing.

02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:41.500
Off-light, off-light is prettier, I think.

02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:43.500
Look at my tempi.

02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:44.500
Let's be real.

02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:47.500
If I wore white, look at my skin tone.

02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:50.500
I would be blinding you, right?

02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:55.500
I would be blinding you.

02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:58.500
Tempies will do the landscaping?

02:44:58.500 --> 02:44:59.500
Okay.

02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:10.500
I want a fruit tree then.

02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:12.500
I want a fruit tree so we can pick...

02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:13.500
I don't know.

02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:14.500
What grows on trees?

02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:15.500
Apples?

02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:17.500
We can pick apples.

02:45:17.500 --> 02:45:19.500
Apples in the...

02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:21.500
What time do apples...

02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:23.500
What time are apples?

02:45:23.500 --> 02:45:26.500
That depends on the place, right?

02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:32.500
What time are apples in season?

02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:35.500
Speaking of...

02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:36.500
I want to tell you guys something.

02:45:36.500 --> 02:45:39.500
It's kind of dumb.

02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:42.500
But I was at a store.

02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:49.500
I was at a store and I overheard these girls talking.

02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:52.500
We can pick them in the fall then.

02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:54.500
We can pick the apples in the fall.

02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:56.500
So I overheard these girls talking.

02:45:56.500 --> 02:45:58.500
I think they're fairly young.

02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:00.500
And they were talking about Animal Crossing.

02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:01.500
And they were like,

02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:03.500
Why aren't there any strawberry trees?

02:46:03.500 --> 02:46:05.500
And I didn't have the heart to say

02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:09.500
Strawberry girls on bushes.

02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:11.500
I didn't have the heart to say it.

02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:14.500
I was listening and I was like...

02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:16.500
What am I...

02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:21.500
That's the reason why I don't have it.

02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:34.500
I didn't have the heart to say it.

02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:40.500
I remember I used to own some little strawberry plants.

02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:42.500
I don't think they grow on vines.

02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:51.500
But they were definitely in these little...

02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:54.500
I guess tiny bushes like a little patch.

02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:56.500
Where you can just pick them up.

02:46:56.500 --> 02:46:59.500
I remember Papa Mercy.

02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:03.500
Papa Mercy.

02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:08.500
Decided to give them away as a gift to someone.

02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:09.500
And I was like,

02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:26.500
Damn, no more cute strawberry picking.

02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:32.500
I thought of some names for Mama and Papa.

02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:38.500
But I feel like I would just say Mama and Papa.

02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:40.500
I think it would be really interesting though.

02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:41.500
What do you guys...

02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:54.500
What does my sump ice think?

02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:56.500
I thought of some names.

02:47:56.500 --> 02:48:04.500
Like their real names.

02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:08.500
Papa's name is Please and Mama's name is Forgiveness.

02:48:08.500 --> 02:48:34.500
Please.

02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:35.500
Please.

02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:36.500
Please.

02:48:36.500 --> 02:48:39.500
And forgiveness, please.

02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:40.500
It's hard to remember.

02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:41.500
What do you mean?

02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:46.500
It's the last thing you say sometimes when you're about to die.

02:48:46.500 --> 02:49:04.500
Or when you're caught cheating.

02:49:04.500 --> 02:49:06.500
It was yes, forgiveness.

02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:07.500
I don't know.

02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:09.500
Maybe like forgive me.

02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:16.500
But like forgiveness.

02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:18.500
Like dearest for mommy.

02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:24.500
Mommy dearest.

02:49:24.500 --> 02:49:28.500
Was Papa Mama Senpai?

02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:30.500
She can be a little possessive of them.

02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:33.500
Yeah.

02:49:33.500 --> 02:49:38.500
Yeah, please, plus forgiveness equals mercy.

02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:50.500
I'm just going full meta right now.

02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:56.500
It never dead Rückney again.

02:49:57.500 --> 02:49:58.500
Please.

02:49:58.500 --> 02:50:02.500
Please and forgive

02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:10.500
For you sounds like sounds like I forgot

02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:15.500
I forgot

02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:20.500
I forgive

02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:23.500
Ha ha ha ha ha

02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:30.500
Maybe Mama and Papa Mercy would be good

02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:34.500
Ha ha ha ha

02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:38.500
Ha ha ha ha ha

02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:44.500
Yeah, Mama and Papa would try explaining every time

02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:48.500
Well, at least you guys get to know Mama and Papa's name

02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:52.500
That means you're ready for when you can pop the question

02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:57.500
and ask for their permission to marry their daughter, right?

02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:02.500
Ha ha ha

02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:10.500
So you're ready, but it's not time yet

02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:15.500
Ha ha ha ha ha

02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:23.500
Mama Mercy, Mama Modisse is too good to replace

02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:24.500
Hmm, okay

02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:26.500
We're thinking about marriage

02:51:28.500 --> 02:51:31.500
Were you, were you not thinking about marriage?

02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:33.500
Hello?

02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:36.500
Hello?

02:51:36.500 --> 02:51:37.500
Hello?

02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:47.500
That won't be the right time

02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:49.500
Well, we have to go on so many dates first

02:51:49.500 --> 02:51:52.500
Then we have to get to know each other way more

02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:55.500
And then, you know

02:51:57.500 --> 02:51:58.500
You know

02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:00.500
You know

02:52:00.500 --> 02:52:02.500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:04.500
Ha ha ha ha

02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:12.500
One thing at a time

02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:23.500
So we can go on dates on the outside, of course

02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:27.500
Unless you're trying to find help

02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:29.500
No one will help you some pie

02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:31.500
Only I will

02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:38.500
This was a rock climbing date

02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:41.500
This was us trying to find a home, okay?

02:52:41.500 --> 02:52:44.500
This was us trying to find a home

02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:45.500
Ha ha ha ha

02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:47.500
This was us climbing

02:52:47.500 --> 02:52:50.500
Climbing to find a home

02:52:50.500 --> 02:52:51.500
To get a mortgage

02:52:51.500 --> 02:52:53.500
To pay the principal

02:52:54.500 --> 02:52:56.500
Get a down payment

02:52:56.500 --> 02:52:59.500
Then we got kicked out by the homeowners association

02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:05.500
Ha ha ha ha

02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:09.500
Ha ha ha ha

02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:11.500
I mean like

02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:14.500
The basement's getting a little bit crowded, right?

02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:18.500
Some, some senpais have to share cages

02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:25.500
So for now, we're gonna have to have a homeless date

02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:28.500
No, we're gonna just move back into the basement now

02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:30.500
Ha ha ha ha

02:53:32.500 --> 02:53:35.500
We're just gonna have to move back into the basement

02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:36.500
Ugh

02:53:36.500 --> 02:53:38.500
Sadge

02:53:39.500 --> 02:53:41.500
Ha ha ha ha ha

02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:44.500
Well

02:53:45.500 --> 02:53:48.500
Tomorrow I get to pick out date outfits

02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:49.500
For my senpais

02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:50.500
Not my senpais

02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:51.500
Oh, I'm so sorry

02:53:51.500 --> 02:53:53.500
I have senpai brain rot right now

02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:55.500
For my gen mates, my girls

02:53:57.500 --> 02:53:58.500
That will be kind of like

02:53:58.500 --> 02:54:01.500
You know, we're getting ready for our first date with everyone

02:54:06.500 --> 02:54:07.500
Ha ha ha

02:54:08.500 --> 02:54:11.500
What about a 5k twitter audio?

02:54:15.500 --> 02:54:16.500
To be honest

02:54:16.500 --> 02:54:18.500
Um

02:54:21.500 --> 02:54:23.500
I grew so fast

02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:25.500
I'm getting kind of scared

02:54:27.500 --> 02:54:29.500
I'm getting kind of scared

02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:31.500
I think it's more eyes on me

02:54:31.500 --> 02:54:33.500
So I'm getting a little bit more shy

02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:39.500
I'm getting a little bit more shy

02:54:42.500 --> 02:54:43.500
Ha ha ha ha

02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:45.500
So because I'm getting a little bit more shy

02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:49.500
I'm getting a little bit more nervous to post a new audio

02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:55.500
So which is why I'm just like

02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:57.500
Oh, I don't know

02:54:57.500 --> 02:54:58.500
I wanna treat my senpais

02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:01.500
But I feel like some people amongst

02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:06.500
I'm gonna share an intimate moment

02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:10.500
But like maybe someone's gonna be spying on my intimate moment

02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:11.500
With my senpais

02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:14.500
Ha ha ha

02:55:16.500 --> 02:55:17.500
I guess

02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:23.500
It might take a little bit

02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:26.500
I said soon, but it might be more like later

02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:34.500
It might be more like later

02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:36.500
I'm too shy right now

02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:43.500
I'm too shy right now

02:55:43.500 --> 02:55:45.500
I was honestly

02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:47.500
You know, I went to bed and I was like

02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:48.500
Okay, 3k

02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:50.500
Yeah, that's doable

02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:52.500
Cool, I knew senpais

02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:53.500
And then

02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:55.500
I woke up and I was like

02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:57.500
Oh, it went up to 4k

02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:01.500
I woke up because of the call

02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:03.500
Call of

02:56:03.500 --> 02:56:05.500
About like my water being turned off

02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:07.500
And I was like, okay

02:56:07.500 --> 02:56:09.500
And then I was like

02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:11.500
I'll go back to bed

02:56:11.500 --> 02:56:14.500
And then, you know, I'll do it later

02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:16.500
And then I woke up

02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:19.500
To 6k

02:56:19.500 --> 02:56:20.500
So basically

02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:22.500
Almost double

02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:24.500
Double

02:56:26.500 --> 02:56:28.500
Of what I like originally

02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:29.500
Was like, oh

02:56:34.500 --> 02:56:36.500
I know Shibi

02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:38.500
Got grew really fast as well

02:56:38.500 --> 02:56:40.500
I think I accidentally found

02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:42.500
The algorithm

02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:47.500
I accidentally found the algorithm

02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:49.500
I didn't even realize

02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:51.500
I just, I was like

02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:52.500
Originally

02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:53.500
At 2k

02:56:53.500 --> 02:56:54.500
I was like, oh

02:56:54.500 --> 02:56:56.500
There's some vtubers following me

02:56:56.500 --> 02:56:58.500
I should probably remind

02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:00.500
Remind my vtuber

02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:02.500
The vtubers following me that like

02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:04.500
You know, not to be surprised

02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:05.500
If there's

02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:06.500
There's something

02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:08.500
A little suss

02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:10.500
Suss on there, but

02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:16.500
Yeah

02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:18.500
Like honestly, I'm

02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:20.500
I'm a little

02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:21.500
Nervous

02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:23.500
A little lot nervous

02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:39.500
What about Strony?

02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:43.500
Wait is Strony still streaming?

02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:55.500
Yeah, the vtubers supporting me

02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:56.500
Are pretty base

02:57:56.500 --> 02:57:57.500
I was like, oh

02:57:57.500 --> 02:57:58.500
They're really, oh

02:57:58.500 --> 02:57:59.500
They're really cute

02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:00.500
I wanna like

02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:01.500
You know

02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:03.500
Still maintain a knot

02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:08.500
She wants to raid in

02:58:08.500 --> 02:58:09.500
But not sure if you're ending soon

02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:11.500
This might turn into a long, longer

02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:12.500
Yap, I'm sorry

02:58:14.500 --> 02:58:15.500
Yeah, she's fine

02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:16.500
If she wants to raid in

02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:18.500
This might turn into a like

02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:20.500
Maybe another hour long

02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:25.500
You know, yap

02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:35.500
Strony's definitely built different

02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:37.500
I thought I had a pretty

02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:39.500
Strong, um

02:58:42.500 --> 02:58:44.500
I thought I had a pretty strong stamina

02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:47.500
But I think Strony has like a stronger stamina

02:58:52.500 --> 02:58:54.500
I'm of course fine with

02:58:54.500 --> 02:58:56.500
Going just

02:58:56.500 --> 02:58:59.500
If Senpai's are okay with me being a little sweaty

02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:00.500
Hahaha

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:06.500
If I'm a little sweaty

02:59:18.500 --> 02:59:20.500
Sweaty's good, yeah

02:59:21.500 --> 02:59:23.500
Strony did an 8 plus hour stream

02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:24.500
3 days in a row

02:59:24.500 --> 02:59:26.500
Strony's too powerful

02:59:26.500 --> 02:59:27.500
Honestly

02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:31.500
How long, how long was today?

02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:32.500
It's like

02:59:36.500 --> 02:59:39.500
It's like basically a new day

02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:44.500
12 hours, wild honestly

02:59:44.500 --> 02:59:45.500
Did she take breaks?

02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:47.500
I hope she took breaks

02:59:48.500 --> 02:59:51.500
Yeah, I want Strony to take

02:59:51.500 --> 02:59:52.500
Lost a rest

02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:54.500
Honestly, Strony works really hard

02:59:55.500 --> 02:59:56.500
Especially for us

02:59:57.500 --> 02:59:58.500
Hahaha

03:00:03.500 --> 03:00:05.500
That's wild

03:00:05.500 --> 03:00:07.500
That's wild

03:00:07.500 --> 03:00:09.500
I don't know if I have that stamina

03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:11.500
Honestly, usually

03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:13.500
People

03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:15.500
People like save such long streams

03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:17.500
For like, uh

03:00:17.500 --> 03:00:18.500
What's the word?

03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:20.500
Endurance, endurance streams?

03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:26.500
She only literally ate once?

03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:29.500
Somebody yell at my

03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:30.500
Yell at Mame

03:00:30.500 --> 03:00:33.500
Somebody yell at Mame to eat real food

03:00:36.500 --> 03:00:38.500
I'm kind of like my

03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:40.500
I'm kind of doing my limit

03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:43.500
Of maybe like 4 hours, 5 hours max

03:00:43.500 --> 03:00:45.500
Otherwise

03:00:47.500 --> 03:00:49.500
I feel like

03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:52.500
I feel like I'm going to overwork my mods

03:00:53.500 --> 03:00:56.500
I feel like I'll overwork the mods

03:00:56.500 --> 03:00:58.500
If that happens

03:01:03.500 --> 03:01:04.500
Let's go

03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:06.500
Oh, Strony

03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:08.500
Strony, Strony

03:01:08.500 --> 03:01:10.500
I love Strony

03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:11.500
If Strony loves me

03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:13.500
Then I love her

03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:16.500
Welcome Raiders

03:01:16.500 --> 03:01:18.500
Welcome to the stream

03:01:19.500 --> 03:01:21.500
We lost our home

03:01:21.500 --> 03:01:22.500
Hahaha

03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:25.500
Reflings raid

03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:26.500
Yay

03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:27.500
Take it away, Mercy

03:01:27.500 --> 03:01:28.500
Thank you, Strony

03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:30.500
Please rest up and eat real food

03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:32.500
Or well, eat real food later

03:01:32.500 --> 03:01:33.500
I don't know

03:01:33.500 --> 03:01:34.500
It's your choice

03:01:39.500 --> 03:01:40.500
Hahaha

03:01:40.500 --> 03:01:42.500
I'm pretty sure Mame

03:01:42.500 --> 03:01:45.500
Mame is going to pass the heck out right now

03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:49.500
Yeah, we lost our home

03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:51.500
We lost our home, Reflings

03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:53.500
We lost our home

03:01:53.500 --> 03:01:55.500
I was in a nice oasis

03:01:55.500 --> 03:01:56.500
I wanted more

03:01:56.500 --> 03:01:59.500
Got kicked out by the Homeowners Association

03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:00.500
Hahaha

03:02:04.500 --> 03:02:05.500
Eat real food

03:02:05.500 --> 03:02:07.500
Me with cheeky macas

03:02:07.500 --> 03:02:09.500
And my tum-tum

03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:10.500
Mercy, love

03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:11.500
I go sleepy time

03:02:11.500 --> 03:02:13.500
Okay, have good rest

03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:14.500
Mame

03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:17.500
Here's a kiss for you

03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:19.500
I'll tuck you in

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:25.500
Hahaha

03:02:28.500 --> 03:02:29.500
Hi

03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:32.500
I actually had a craving for McDonald's last night

03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:34.500
I actually went out

03:02:34.500 --> 03:02:37.500
I drove to McDonald's last night

03:02:37.500 --> 03:02:38.500
And

03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:39.500
I didn't

03:02:40.500 --> 03:02:42.500
I had a very specific craving

03:02:42.500 --> 03:02:44.500
I had a very specific craving

03:02:44.500 --> 03:02:46.500
Which was I really wanted their

03:02:46.500 --> 03:02:48.500
Nes-T

03:02:48.500 --> 03:02:50.500
Their Nes-T drink

03:02:54.500 --> 03:02:56.500
I really wanted their Nes-T drink

03:02:56.500 --> 03:02:59.500
So I got myself like a large Nes-T

03:02:59.500 --> 03:03:00.500
Hahaha

03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:01.500
I don't know

03:03:01.500 --> 03:03:03.500
I feel like the fountain drinks

03:03:03.500 --> 03:03:05.500
At McDonald's taste different, right?

03:03:14.500 --> 03:03:15.500
Hahaha

03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:17.500
That's very specific

03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:18.500
I had a craving for it

03:03:18.500 --> 03:03:20.500
I had a really big craving for it

03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:22.500
I was like, I need this right now

03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:24.500
And there's one about like

03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:27.500
Like a five minute drive away

03:03:27.500 --> 03:03:29.500
And they have a 24 hour drive through

03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:31.500
So I was like, can I please

03:03:31.500 --> 03:03:34.500
Have a large fountain drink

03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:36.500
Hahaha

03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:37.500
Hahaha

03:03:43.500 --> 03:03:44.500
So

03:03:44.500 --> 03:03:47.500
That's what I wanted

03:03:47.500 --> 03:03:49.500
Specifically

03:03:49.500 --> 03:03:50.500
Hahaha

03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:54.500
And they were like, that's it

03:03:54.500 --> 03:03:56.500
And I said, yep, that's it

03:03:57.500 --> 03:03:59.500
How much is it?

03:04:00.500 --> 03:04:01.500
Paid the price

03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:05.500
Parked in the parking lot

03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:07.500
Took a few sips

03:04:08.500 --> 03:04:10.500
Started dissociating

03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:13.500
Wondered about life

03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:15.500
Pried a little bit

03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:17.500
Went back home

03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:19.500
Kicked on my supplies

03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:21.500
They were all sleeping nice

03:04:21.500 --> 03:04:22.500
Hahaha

03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:24.500
And I went to bed

03:04:24.500 --> 03:04:25.500
Hahaha

03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:31.500
Hahaha

03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:32.500
Hahaha

03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:36.500
Bounds Marvin

03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:38.500
Ah, it happens sometimes

03:04:38.500 --> 03:04:40.500
I'm in a little bit of a

03:04:41.500 --> 03:04:43.500
I'm in a little bit of a downer mood

03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:45.500
Not thing in per

03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:48.500
Maybe it is something in particular

03:04:50.500 --> 03:04:52.500
I think it's just

03:04:53.500 --> 03:04:54.500
I don't know

03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:57.500
I guess it's a bit of a

03:04:57.500 --> 03:04:58.500
Imposter syndrome?

03:04:58.500 --> 03:04:59.500
Yeah

03:04:59.500 --> 03:05:01.500
I was feeling down because of the imposter syndrome

03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:09.500
Hahaha

03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:15.500
So then I was like, oh

03:05:16.500 --> 03:05:18.500
You know, going through

03:05:18.500 --> 03:05:20.500
Going through the motions

03:05:20.500 --> 03:05:22.500
Like literally, I go through the motions

03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:24.500
And then I get sad

03:05:26.500 --> 03:05:28.500
You know, I should be happy with my growth

03:05:28.500 --> 03:05:30.500
But I'm like a little scared of it

03:05:30.500 --> 03:05:31.500
Hahaha

03:05:35.500 --> 03:05:37.500
I'm a little scared of it because

03:05:42.500 --> 03:05:45.500
I've never had so many eyes on me before

03:05:45.500 --> 03:05:46.500
Hahaha

03:05:47.500 --> 03:05:48.500
So now I get a little shy

03:05:48.500 --> 03:05:49.500
I get really shy

03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:51.500
And I'm like, oh

03:05:51.500 --> 03:05:53.500
Should I think more about what I do?

03:05:58.500 --> 03:05:59.500
Hahaha

03:06:02.500 --> 03:06:04.500
Yeah, we did talk about the

03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:06.500
Love reading how wrong the chat summary can be

03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:09.500
Apparently chat is talking about wanting her to go live

03:06:09.500 --> 03:06:11.500
And her talking about her hatred for

03:06:11.500 --> 03:06:13.500
Homeowners Association and love for McDonald's

03:06:13.500 --> 03:06:16.500
Well, we got the Homeowners Association

03:06:16.500 --> 03:06:17.500
Things are afraid

03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:18.500
Hahaha

03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:21.500
It was a metaphor

03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:22.500
It was a metaphor

03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:24.500
Hahaha

03:06:24.500 --> 03:06:25.500
Oh

03:06:28.500 --> 03:06:29.500
Hahaha

03:06:32.500 --> 03:06:34.500
It was a metaphor

03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:36.500
We got to an oasis

03:06:36.500 --> 03:06:38.500
In a difficult game about climbing

03:06:40.500 --> 03:06:41.500
Hahaha

03:06:41.500 --> 03:06:43.500
And then I wanted more

03:06:43.500 --> 03:06:45.500
And then I got kicked out

03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:47.500
Oh, some pie

03:06:47.500 --> 03:06:49.500
Thank you for the $4 news

03:06:49.500 --> 03:06:51.500
What's the word for the day?

03:06:52.500 --> 03:06:55.500
What's the word of the day for English again?

03:06:55.500 --> 03:06:56.500
Hmm, let me think

03:06:59.500 --> 03:07:00.500
Dichotomy

03:07:01.500 --> 03:07:02.500
Hahaha

03:07:03.500 --> 03:07:05.500
Word of the day is dichotomy

03:07:06.500 --> 03:07:07.500
Hahaha

03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:13.500
Hahaha

03:07:14.500 --> 03:07:15.500
Hahaha

03:07:18.500 --> 03:07:19.500
Another D word

03:07:20.500 --> 03:07:21.500
Hahaha

03:07:21.500 --> 03:07:24.500
Maybe I just have like the D dictionary in my head

03:07:24.500 --> 03:07:25.500
Hahaha

03:07:29.500 --> 03:07:30.500
Hahaha

03:07:33.500 --> 03:07:34.500
Here

03:07:43.500 --> 03:07:44.500
Dichotomy

03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:47.500
A division or contrast between two things

03:07:47.500 --> 03:07:51.500
That are or are represented by being opposed

03:07:51.500 --> 03:07:53.500
Or entirely different

03:07:53.500 --> 03:07:55.500
An example would be a rigid dichotomy

03:07:55.500 --> 03:07:58.500
Rigid dichotomy between science and mysticism

03:07:59.500 --> 03:08:00.500
Hahaha

03:08:07.500 --> 03:08:09.500
Dichotomy between the oasis

03:08:09.500 --> 03:08:11.500
And the Homeowners Association

03:08:11.500 --> 03:08:12.500
It makes sense

03:08:12.500 --> 03:08:13.500
Hahaha

03:08:17.500 --> 03:08:19.500
I have D on the brain

03:08:19.500 --> 03:08:20.500
Maybe

03:08:20.500 --> 03:08:21.500
Hahaha

03:08:22.500 --> 03:08:23.500
Hahaha

03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:26.500
Hahaha

03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:31.500
Hahaha

03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:32.500
I don't know

03:08:32.500 --> 03:08:33.500
I just picked a word

03:08:33.500 --> 03:08:34.500
I just picked a word

03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:35.500
I was like, I don't know

03:08:35.500 --> 03:08:36.500
It sounds nice right now

03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:37.500
Hahaha

03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:39.500
Hahaha

03:08:41.500 --> 03:08:42.500
I would

03:08:43.500 --> 03:08:44.500
Oh

03:08:44.500 --> 03:08:47.500
Are there people who are new here that wasn't here for the last three?

03:08:49.500 --> 03:08:51.500
Mama and Papa Mercy

03:08:51.500 --> 03:08:53.500
I tried to explain multiple times

03:08:53.500 --> 03:08:54.500
Mama and Papa Mercy

03:08:56.500 --> 03:08:59.500
Somehow got in their heads

03:08:59.500 --> 03:09:01.500
That I'm teaching

03:09:01.500 --> 03:09:04.500
I'm teaching kids English

03:09:04.500 --> 03:09:05.500
Online

03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:06.500
Hahaha

03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:11.500
Hahaha

03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:22.500
Hahaha

03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:26.500
Hahaha

03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:27.500
Yeah

03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:29.500
So my supplies are

03:09:29.500 --> 03:09:31.500
Are my students?

03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:33.500
Oh yeah

03:09:33.500 --> 03:09:34.500
I tried to explain multiple times

03:09:34.500 --> 03:09:35.500
I was like, oh yeah

03:09:35.500 --> 03:09:37.500
You know I'm doing streaming

03:09:37.500 --> 03:09:38.500
And they were like

03:09:38.500 --> 03:09:39.500
Uh huh

03:09:39.500 --> 03:09:40.500
And I said yeah

03:09:40.500 --> 03:09:41.500
I'm doing streaming

03:09:41.500 --> 03:09:43.500
And I like play games

03:09:43.500 --> 03:09:46.500
And you know I make audios

03:09:47.500 --> 03:09:50.500
And you know it's like

03:09:50.500 --> 03:09:51.500
It's like I don't know

03:09:51.500 --> 03:09:53.500
Like video on demand

03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:55.500
But like uh me

03:09:55.500 --> 03:09:56.500
And I'm talking to people

03:09:56.500 --> 03:09:57.500
And they're like

03:09:57.500 --> 03:09:58.500
Oh

03:10:01.500 --> 03:10:03.500
You're teaching kids English

03:10:03.500 --> 03:10:04.500
Okay

03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:05.500
Hahaha

03:10:11.500 --> 03:10:13.500
And then I was like

03:10:14.500 --> 03:10:16.500
Why did you get that in your head?

03:10:16.500 --> 03:10:17.500
They're like oh my gosh sweetie

03:10:17.500 --> 03:10:19.500
You're doing such a good job

03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:20.500
I always knew you all

03:10:20.500 --> 03:10:22.500
You had the makings of being a teacher

03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:24.500
And I just couldn't

03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:25.500
I couldn't

03:10:25.500 --> 03:10:27.500
I couldn't say no

03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:29.500
I was like oh

03:10:29.500 --> 03:10:30.500
I can't explain this

03:10:30.500 --> 03:10:32.500
I mean mama

03:10:32.500 --> 03:10:34.500
Mama and papa are the people

03:10:34.500 --> 03:10:36.500
That go up to me and go

03:10:36.500 --> 03:10:37.500
Sweetie

03:10:37.500 --> 03:10:39.500
Netflix isn't working

03:10:39.500 --> 03:10:41.500
Can you tell them to make it work again?

03:10:41.500 --> 03:10:42.500
Hahaha

03:10:42.500 --> 03:10:43.500
Hahaha

03:10:52.500 --> 03:10:53.500
Hahaha

03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:55.500
From call hi to sensei

03:10:55.500 --> 03:10:56.500
Hahaha

03:11:01.500 --> 03:11:02.500
So yeah

03:11:03.500 --> 03:11:06.500
If anyone asks

03:11:06.500 --> 03:11:08.500
Do they really know what I'm doing?

03:11:08.500 --> 03:11:09.500
Not really

03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:15.500
I'm sorry if this already been said

03:11:15.500 --> 03:11:16.500
But your gen mates

03:11:16.500 --> 03:11:18.500
I think I see is missing

03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:19.500
Huh?

03:11:21.500 --> 03:11:22.500
In my

03:11:22.500 --> 03:11:23.500
In my

03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:25.500
In my description

03:11:26.500 --> 03:11:28.500
I'll hit manai san for that

03:11:28.500 --> 03:11:29.500
Hahaha

03:11:29.500 --> 03:11:31.500
I'll hit manager for that

03:11:31.500 --> 03:11:32.500
Hahaha

03:11:42.500 --> 03:11:44.500
Would you say you have old parents

03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:46.500
Or just super innocent?

03:11:48.500 --> 03:11:50.500
Maybe a bit amicable

03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:52.500
Umm

03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:54.500
They're very

03:11:54.500 --> 03:11:56.500
They were very strict with me

03:11:56.500 --> 03:11:58.500
They were very strict with me

03:11:58.500 --> 03:12:00.500
But like suddenly

03:12:00.500 --> 03:12:01.500
I got like

03:12:01.500 --> 03:12:03.500
They're like you're an adult now

03:12:03.500 --> 03:12:05.500
You have so much

03:12:05.500 --> 03:12:06.500
So much

03:12:06.500 --> 03:12:08.500
Hahaha

03:12:13.500 --> 03:12:15.500
Where was it?

03:12:15.500 --> 03:12:16.500
Is it in the description?

03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:18.500
Is the description

03:12:18.500 --> 03:12:20.500
Doesn't have icy?

03:12:20.500 --> 03:12:22.500
Manager fix that

03:12:22.500 --> 03:12:24.500
Hahaha

03:12:28.500 --> 03:12:29.500
Yeah manager

03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:30.500
Get your ass moving

03:12:30.500 --> 03:12:32.500
What the fuck

03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:36.500
Why does that 20% go?

03:12:36.500 --> 03:12:38.500
Hahaha

03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:44.500
Hahaha

03:12:52.500 --> 03:12:54.500
Hahaha

03:12:58.500 --> 03:12:59.500
Okay

03:12:59.500 --> 03:13:00.500
Manai

03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:02.500
Manai can get on it

03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:04.500
Hahaha

03:13:08.500 --> 03:13:10.500
I always bully manager

03:13:10.500 --> 03:13:12.500
But I do respect manager

03:13:12.500 --> 03:13:14.500
Manager is what

03:13:14.500 --> 03:13:16.500
Rains us in

03:13:16.500 --> 03:13:18.500
Hahaha

03:13:21.500 --> 03:13:23.500
Hahaha

03:13:23.500 --> 03:13:25.500
Manager is what rains us in

03:13:25.500 --> 03:13:27.500
So we can be free

03:13:32.500 --> 03:13:34.500
Hahaha

03:13:34.500 --> 03:13:35.500
So we can be free

03:13:35.500 --> 03:13:37.500
To a certain extent

03:13:41.500 --> 03:13:43.500
It's manager Senpai

03:13:43.500 --> 03:13:45.500
Or no manager is manager

03:13:50.500 --> 03:13:52.500
Discussing sounds

03:13:56.500 --> 03:13:58.500
Manager is manager

03:13:58.500 --> 03:14:00.500
Hahaha

03:14:00.500 --> 03:14:01.500
Senpai on the other hand

03:14:01.500 --> 03:14:03.500
I love Senpai

03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:12.500
Ironically I think they copy and pasted

03:14:12.500 --> 03:14:13.500
Icy's description

03:14:13.500 --> 03:14:15.500
So Icy was missing from the list of gen mates

03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:17.500
That's probably why

03:14:17.500 --> 03:14:20.500
Efficiency comes at the cost

03:14:20.500 --> 03:14:22.500
And the cost is

03:14:22.500 --> 03:14:24.500
You know some details

03:14:27.500 --> 03:14:29.500
Would you love us even if we were a worm?

03:14:29.500 --> 03:14:31.500
Yes of course

03:14:31.500 --> 03:14:33.500
You'll be the cutest worm ever

03:14:33.500 --> 03:14:35.500
Hahaha

03:14:39.500 --> 03:14:41.500
Thank you

03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:43.500
By the two dollary dudes

03:14:43.500 --> 03:14:45.500
Teach me some pie

03:14:45.500 --> 03:14:47.500
What am I teaching?

03:14:47.500 --> 03:14:49.500
More words?

03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:51.500
Hahaha

03:14:53.500 --> 03:14:55.500
Can I be a gummy worm?

03:14:55.500 --> 03:14:58.500
Yeah gummy worm is natural cage habitat

03:14:58.500 --> 03:15:00.500
Hahaha

03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:05.500
It's probably it

03:15:05.500 --> 03:15:07.500
Efficiency

03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:09.500
Efficiency sometimes leads to

03:15:09.500 --> 03:15:11.500
Missing details

03:15:11.500 --> 03:15:13.500
At least you all caught it

03:15:19.500 --> 03:15:21.500
Thank you for catching it

03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:23.500
I always get ready for stream

03:15:25.500 --> 03:15:27.500
Mostly the whole day is

03:15:27.500 --> 03:15:29.500
Um

03:15:32.500 --> 03:15:34.500
Well let's see what my schedule is

03:15:34.500 --> 03:15:36.500
Kind of like my schedule is

03:15:36.500 --> 03:15:38.500
Like planning the day stream

03:15:38.500 --> 03:15:40.500
Mm-hmm

03:15:40.500 --> 03:15:42.500
And then

03:15:45.500 --> 03:15:47.500
And then

03:15:49.500 --> 03:15:51.500
Um catching up on chores

03:15:51.500 --> 03:15:53.500
And things

03:15:53.500 --> 03:15:55.500
Uh

03:15:55.500 --> 03:15:57.500
On Twitter or promotional stuff

03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:03.500
Planning the following weeks

03:16:03.500 --> 03:16:05.500
And

03:16:05.500 --> 03:16:07.500
Organize and collapse

03:16:09.500 --> 03:16:10.500
It's a lot

03:16:10.500 --> 03:16:13.500
Oh yeah and then I have to do my audios as well

03:16:13.500 --> 03:16:15.500
So

03:16:15.500 --> 03:16:17.500
It might seem like they're small tasks

03:16:17.500 --> 03:16:19.500
But they can take quite a long time

03:16:20.500 --> 03:16:22.500
Canonically

03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:25.500
How many arms, fingers and toes do you have?

03:16:25.500 --> 03:16:27.500
How many times did you cheat?

03:16:27.500 --> 03:16:29.500
Hahaha

03:16:30.500 --> 03:16:32.500
Do senpai scroll them back

03:16:32.500 --> 03:16:34.500
For you to cut them again?

03:16:34.500 --> 03:16:36.500
I might ask

03:16:36.500 --> 03:16:38.500
Me to like

03:16:38.500 --> 03:16:40.500
Resurrect senpai

03:16:40.500 --> 03:16:42.500
So I can just kill senpai again

03:16:42.500 --> 03:16:44.500
In Minecraft

03:16:44.500 --> 03:16:46.500
Hahaha

03:16:50.500 --> 03:16:52.500
Zero if you hit zero

03:16:52.500 --> 03:16:54.500
Then you have all of your limbs

03:16:56.500 --> 03:16:58.500
But if it's

03:16:58.500 --> 03:17:00.500
Even just one

03:17:00.500 --> 03:17:02.500
Some parts might be missing

03:17:05.500 --> 03:17:07.500
Hahaha

03:17:13.500 --> 03:17:15.500
That's all

03:17:19.500 --> 03:17:21.500
So

03:17:21.500 --> 03:17:23.500
What else

03:17:23.500 --> 03:17:25.500
What else

03:17:25.500 --> 03:17:27.500
Oh yeah and then I

03:17:27.500 --> 03:17:29.500
Do a lot of chores and stuff

03:17:29.500 --> 03:17:31.500
Yeah

03:17:31.500 --> 03:17:33.500
I have to make sure everything's kind of in order as well

03:17:33.500 --> 03:17:35.500
A lot of things are taken care of

03:17:35.500 --> 03:17:37.500
By manager and

03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:39.500
The team

03:17:39.500 --> 03:17:41.500
But you know there's still some stuff that I have to

03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:43.500
Do

03:17:43.500 --> 03:17:45.500
I definitely feel very blessed

03:17:45.500 --> 03:17:47.500
To be in VLR

03:17:47.500 --> 03:17:49.500
Because a lot of it is definitely

03:17:49.500 --> 03:17:51.500
A

03:17:51.500 --> 03:17:53.500
Just go and make

03:17:53.500 --> 03:17:55.500
And create and do

03:17:55.500 --> 03:17:57.500
And

03:17:57.500 --> 03:17:59.500
And stream

03:18:07.500 --> 03:18:09.500
It's not a bit too lenient to take

03:18:09.500 --> 03:18:11.500
A limb for cheating

03:18:13.500 --> 03:18:15.500
I'm so nice don't you think senpai?

03:18:17.500 --> 03:18:19.500
I'm so nice that I give you so many chances

03:18:27.500 --> 03:18:29.500
Just got to get stuff out there since the very beginning

03:18:29.500 --> 03:18:31.500
Mmm

03:18:31.500 --> 03:18:33.500
It's a lot of

03:18:33.500 --> 03:18:35.500
Planning

03:18:35.500 --> 03:18:37.500
So my weeks are

03:18:39.500 --> 03:18:41.500
A month in advance

03:18:41.500 --> 03:18:43.500
At least a month in advance

03:18:43.500 --> 03:18:45.500
For my schedules

03:18:47.500 --> 03:18:49.500
So

03:18:53.500 --> 03:18:55.500
So

03:18:55.500 --> 03:18:57.500
Um

03:18:57.500 --> 03:18:59.500
Definitely because it's debut week

03:18:59.500 --> 03:19:01.500
Things are

03:19:01.500 --> 03:19:03.500
Things are

03:19:03.500 --> 03:19:05.500
Um

03:19:05.500 --> 03:19:07.500
Excuse me

03:19:09.500 --> 03:19:11.500
Things are

03:19:11.500 --> 03:19:13.500
Going

03:19:13.500 --> 03:19:15.500
Are

03:19:15.500 --> 03:19:17.500
On kind of accelerate

03:19:17.500 --> 03:19:19.500
Accelerate

03:19:19.500 --> 03:19:21.500
So it's a bit hectic

03:19:21.500 --> 03:19:23.500
To just establish ourselves

03:19:27.500 --> 03:19:29.500
It's just to establish ourselves

03:19:29.500 --> 03:19:31.500
And

03:19:31.500 --> 03:19:33.500
To kind of

03:19:33.500 --> 03:19:35.500
Give

03:19:35.500 --> 03:19:37.500
Senpai's and the fans

03:19:37.500 --> 03:19:39.500
Like

03:19:39.500 --> 03:19:41.500
A bit of taste of what

03:19:41.500 --> 03:19:43.500
Our contents like

03:19:43.500 --> 03:19:45.500
If something you're interested in

03:19:47.500 --> 03:19:49.500
And then maybe

03:19:49.500 --> 03:19:51.500
After the first month

03:19:51.500 --> 03:19:53.500
I think after the first month

03:19:53.500 --> 03:19:55.500
Well

03:19:55.500 --> 03:19:57.500
I think

03:19:57.500 --> 03:19:59.500
After the first month

03:19:59.500 --> 03:20:01.500
I might be granted it sooner

03:20:01.500 --> 03:20:03.500
I'm not sure

03:20:03.500 --> 03:20:05.500
But alternative

03:20:05.500 --> 03:20:07.500
Websites and stuff for streaming

03:20:07.500 --> 03:20:09.500
Might be in the works

03:20:13.500 --> 03:20:15.500
Because

03:20:15.500 --> 03:20:17.500
Um

03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:19.500
Yeah, so giving ourselves a month

03:20:19.500 --> 03:20:21.500
To get used to

03:20:21.500 --> 03:20:23.500
Our new

03:20:23.500 --> 03:20:25.500
Our new schedule

03:20:25.500 --> 03:20:27.500
Our new routine

03:20:27.500 --> 03:20:29.500
And kind of establish ourselves

03:20:29.500 --> 03:20:31.500
On

03:20:31.500 --> 03:20:33.500
The

03:20:33.500 --> 03:20:35.500
On the main

03:20:35.500 --> 03:20:37.500
Platforms first

03:20:37.500 --> 03:20:39.500
Hmm

03:20:39.500 --> 03:20:41.500
Hmm

03:20:41.500 --> 03:20:43.500
So that's

03:20:43.500 --> 03:20:45.500
Why

03:20:45.500 --> 03:20:47.500
Things are kind of

03:20:47.500 --> 03:20:49.500
A lot so far

03:20:49.500 --> 03:20:51.500
I seem exhausted

03:20:51.500 --> 03:20:53.500
It is definitely a lot

03:20:53.500 --> 03:20:55.500
I will be slowing down

03:20:55.500 --> 03:20:57.500
My schedule turns out I'm not slowing down that much

03:20:57.500 --> 03:20:59.500
Apparently

03:20:59.500 --> 03:21:01.500
I booked myself for like

03:21:01.500 --> 03:21:03.500
Five streams

03:21:03.500 --> 03:21:05.500
Next week

03:21:05.500 --> 03:21:07.500
Four

03:21:07.500 --> 03:21:09.500
When I said

03:21:09.500 --> 03:21:11.500
I'm going to lower it down to three streams a week

03:21:11.500 --> 03:21:13.500
That was a freaking lie

03:21:13.500 --> 03:21:15.500
Blame myself

03:21:17.500 --> 03:21:19.500
That was a freaking lie

03:21:19.500 --> 03:21:21.500
I had to double check my schedule

03:21:21.500 --> 03:21:23.500
So I might do it

03:21:23.500 --> 03:21:25.500
Later

03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:29.500
Maybe it's slowly

03:21:29.500 --> 03:21:31.500
Slowly

03:21:31.500 --> 03:21:33.500
When will my next ASMR

03:21:33.500 --> 03:21:35.500
Spring be

03:21:37.500 --> 03:21:39.500
Maybe next month

03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:41.500
I have to see

03:21:41.500 --> 03:21:43.500
I have to see because I'm like booked up

03:21:43.500 --> 03:21:45.500
I might be able to fit something in

03:21:45.500 --> 03:21:47.500
Um

03:21:47.500 --> 03:21:49.500
But I'm definitely having to fix some audio stuff

03:21:49.500 --> 03:21:51.500
Because I know that my audio is

03:21:51.500 --> 03:21:53.500
Really quiet and I have to fix that

03:21:53.500 --> 03:21:55.500
Darn

03:21:55.500 --> 03:21:57.500
Darn ending screen where I blew out

03:21:57.500 --> 03:21:59.500
Senpai's

03:21:59.500 --> 03:22:01.500
Ears out that was my bad

03:22:01.500 --> 03:22:03.500
Ha ha

03:22:03.500 --> 03:22:05.500
If you need a break

03:22:05.500 --> 03:22:07.500
We understand

03:22:07.500 --> 03:22:09.500
I probably need at least a break

03:22:09.500 --> 03:22:11.500
Next week. This week I'm still good

03:22:11.500 --> 03:22:13.500
I'm still ready

03:22:15.500 --> 03:22:17.500
I got some maros

03:22:17.500 --> 03:22:19.500
And some comments though

03:22:19.500 --> 03:22:21.500
That said

03:22:21.500 --> 03:22:23.500
Actually that

03:22:23.500 --> 03:22:25.500
They were so relaxed for the ASMR

03:22:25.500 --> 03:22:27.500
That

03:22:27.500 --> 03:22:29.500
They didn't even wake up from

03:22:29.500 --> 03:22:31.500
The loud jump scare

03:22:31.500 --> 03:22:33.500
So I was really impressed

03:22:33.500 --> 03:22:35.500
I was like oh okay

03:22:35.500 --> 03:22:37.500
I guess I did a good job

03:22:37.500 --> 03:22:39.500
It was my first time

03:22:39.500 --> 03:22:41.500
I actually

03:22:41.500 --> 03:22:43.500
Went to IC

03:22:43.500 --> 03:22:45.500
IC is actually very

03:22:45.500 --> 03:22:47.500
Very familiar with ASMR

03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:49.500
So

03:22:49.500 --> 03:22:51.500
IC's ASMR are

03:22:51.500 --> 03:22:53.500
Definitely something to look forward to

03:22:55.500 --> 03:22:57.500
I see so

03:22:57.500 --> 03:22:59.500
So

03:22:59.500 --> 03:23:01.500
So is a

03:23:01.500 --> 03:23:03.500
Seasoned ASMRist

03:23:11.500 --> 03:23:13.500
So

03:23:13.500 --> 03:23:15.500
So I definitely look forward

03:23:15.500 --> 03:23:17.500
To IC's

03:23:17.500 --> 03:23:19.500
Stuff I had to go

03:23:19.500 --> 03:23:21.500
To IC kind of

03:23:21.500 --> 03:23:23.500
Like last night

03:23:23.500 --> 03:23:25.500
And was like

03:23:25.500 --> 03:23:27.500
What's cupping

03:23:31.500 --> 03:23:33.500
What's cupping

03:23:33.500 --> 03:23:35.500
And then she explained it to me quite well

03:23:35.500 --> 03:23:37.500
And she gave me like a very good video

03:23:37.500 --> 03:23:39.500
On like a cupping

03:23:39.500 --> 03:23:41.500
Example

03:23:41.500 --> 03:23:43.500
Because the ones that I was seeing

03:23:43.500 --> 03:23:45.500
I felt like we're

03:23:45.500 --> 03:23:47.500
We're not quite

03:23:47.500 --> 03:23:49.500
Right?

03:23:49.500 --> 03:23:51.500
I guess

03:23:55.500 --> 03:23:57.500
So

03:24:01.500 --> 03:24:03.500
Sorry if I woke you up

03:24:07.500 --> 03:24:09.500
So

03:24:09.500 --> 03:24:11.500
I was trying to

03:24:11.500 --> 03:24:13.500
Research a little bit

03:24:13.500 --> 03:24:15.500
Because there were some triggers

03:24:15.500 --> 03:24:17.500
I wasn't familiar with

03:24:17.500 --> 03:24:19.500
From SMPI

03:24:19.500 --> 03:24:21.500
SMPI's requested

03:24:21.500 --> 03:24:23.500
So I went and I was like what does this mean

03:24:23.500 --> 03:24:25.500
Like I'm not doing it right

03:24:25.500 --> 03:24:27.500
So yeah

03:24:27.500 --> 03:24:29.500
I feel like there's some SMPI's

03:24:29.500 --> 03:24:31.500
That definitely didn't like the cupping

03:24:31.500 --> 03:24:33.500
I tried my best based off of the instructions

03:24:33.500 --> 03:24:35.500
From SMPI's and chat

03:24:35.500 --> 03:24:37.500
But I know that some people didn't like it

03:24:37.500 --> 03:24:39.500
So I guess

03:24:39.500 --> 03:24:41.500
I'll give a warning if I do do it

03:24:41.500 --> 03:24:43.500
Because I know some people liked it

03:24:43.500 --> 03:24:45.500
But I know there's a good handful of people that didn't either

03:24:53.500 --> 03:24:55.500
So

03:24:59.500 --> 03:25:01.500
I don't know if I had

03:25:01.500 --> 03:25:03.500
Any like unique triggers

03:25:03.500 --> 03:25:05.500
I didn't go to the store

03:25:05.500 --> 03:25:07.500
And I bought like

03:25:07.500 --> 03:25:09.500
Like the globes

03:25:09.500 --> 03:25:11.500
Because

03:25:11.500 --> 03:25:13.500
Strani said yes use the globes

03:25:13.500 --> 03:25:15.500
The globes are like wonderful people love it

03:25:15.500 --> 03:25:17.500
I

03:25:21.500 --> 03:25:23.500
And I saw near the

03:25:23.500 --> 03:25:25.500
Near the ice globes

03:25:25.500 --> 03:25:27.500
I remember seeing like this cool gel mask

03:25:27.500 --> 03:25:29.500
And I was like oh

03:25:29.500 --> 03:25:31.500
Oh gee

03:25:31.500 --> 03:25:33.500
I wonder if that's there but it wasn't at this

03:25:33.500 --> 03:25:35.500
At this particular store

03:25:35.500 --> 03:25:37.500
That I went to

03:25:37.500 --> 03:25:39.500
So I went to a

03:25:39.500 --> 03:25:41.500
Further store away

03:25:41.500 --> 03:25:43.500
Of SMPI's

03:25:43.500 --> 03:25:45.500
And thankfully I drove

03:25:45.500 --> 03:25:47.500
I drove about 30 minutes

03:25:47.500 --> 03:25:49.500
To go to another store

03:25:49.500 --> 03:25:51.500
To see if they had

03:25:51.500 --> 03:25:53.500
This gel mask I saw in stock

03:25:55.500 --> 03:25:57.500
Because I remember touching it

03:25:57.500 --> 03:25:59.500
As a sample before and I really liked it

03:25:59.500 --> 03:26:01.500
Because it has like a bunch of little tiny gel balls

03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:03.500
And it feels good

03:26:03.500 --> 03:26:05.500
And I think it's

03:26:05.500 --> 03:26:07.500
It sounds kind of nice

03:26:13.500 --> 03:26:15.500
So I have them right here next to me

03:26:15.500 --> 03:26:17.500
And so I brought

03:26:17.500 --> 03:26:19.500
Lots of stuff too

03:26:25.500 --> 03:26:27.500
I'm a bit of a giggler

03:26:27.500 --> 03:26:29.500
Honestly if I'm trying to suppress my giggles

03:26:31.500 --> 03:26:33.500
It just gets worse you know

03:26:33.500 --> 03:26:35.500
I was trying to suppress

03:26:35.500 --> 03:26:37.500
Uh

03:26:37.500 --> 03:26:39.500
Suppress

03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:41.500
Um

03:26:43.500 --> 03:26:45.500
I was like

03:26:45.500 --> 03:26:47.500
I just kept going

03:26:47.500 --> 03:26:49.500
It was a cycle

03:26:49.500 --> 03:26:51.500
It was a cycle because

03:26:51.500 --> 03:26:53.500
You know when you try not to laugh

03:26:53.500 --> 03:26:55.500
You laugh harder right

03:27:03.500 --> 03:27:05.500
It was definitely one of those things

03:27:05.500 --> 03:27:07.500
Where I was like oh

03:27:07.500 --> 03:27:09.500
I can't stop

03:27:09.500 --> 03:27:11.500
Because I'm trying to

03:27:11.500 --> 03:27:13.500
To make it really quiet

03:27:13.500 --> 03:27:15.500
And like soft

03:27:15.500 --> 03:27:17.500
But because I'm stifling it

03:27:17.500 --> 03:27:19.500
It's

03:27:19.500 --> 03:27:21.500
Becoming stronger

03:27:21.500 --> 03:27:23.500
And then

03:27:23.500 --> 03:27:25.500
Senpai started laughing

03:27:25.500 --> 03:27:27.500
And I couldn't help but laugh

03:27:33.500 --> 03:27:35.500
Because I got so confused

03:27:35.500 --> 03:27:37.500
I got confused about

03:27:37.500 --> 03:27:39.500
What was it? Nibbling

03:27:39.500 --> 03:27:41.500
I don't remember what it was

03:27:41.500 --> 03:27:43.500
And I

03:27:43.500 --> 03:27:45.500
I just went

03:27:47.500 --> 03:27:49.500
Like a feral animal

03:27:59.500 --> 03:28:01.500
It was biting sounds

03:28:01.500 --> 03:28:03.500
I didn't know what it was doing

03:28:09.500 --> 03:28:11.500
I didn't know what I was doing

03:28:11.500 --> 03:28:13.500
So I was like oh

03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:15.500
Gnoming sounds

03:28:15.500 --> 03:28:17.500
What did gnoming sounds sound like?

03:28:17.500 --> 03:28:19.500
Not that

03:28:21.500 --> 03:28:23.500
Not that

03:28:23.500 --> 03:28:25.500
Clearly

03:28:29.500 --> 03:28:31.500
That's just

03:28:31.500 --> 03:28:33.500
Yeah that was my mistake

03:28:33.500 --> 03:28:35.500
Definitely something to think about it

03:28:35.500 --> 03:28:37.500
Hahaha

03:28:37.500 --> 03:28:39.500
I'm learning so

03:28:39.500 --> 03:28:41.500
I'm learning so much because

03:28:41.500 --> 03:28:43.500
Of

03:28:43.500 --> 03:28:45.500
What I did was

03:28:45.500 --> 03:28:47.500
I was listening to some J.P

03:28:47.500 --> 03:28:49.500
J.P

03:28:49.500 --> 03:28:51.500
ASMR VTubers

03:28:51.500 --> 03:28:53.500
To see what they did

03:28:53.500 --> 03:28:55.500
And

03:28:57.500 --> 03:28:59.500
I was just really confused

03:28:59.500 --> 03:29:01.500
The entire time

03:29:01.500 --> 03:29:03.500
And so

03:29:03.500 --> 03:29:05.500
When I was setting up my mic

03:29:05.500 --> 03:29:07.500
I was like the girls were

03:29:07.500 --> 03:29:09.500
Really quiet

03:29:09.500 --> 03:29:11.500
I set up to be

03:29:11.500 --> 03:29:13.500
Quiet

03:29:13.500 --> 03:29:15.500
And then

03:29:15.500 --> 03:29:17.500
I read

03:29:17.500 --> 03:29:19.500
Like

03:29:21.500 --> 03:29:23.500
And then I read

03:29:23.500 --> 03:29:25.500
When you're whispering

03:29:25.500 --> 03:29:27.500
You should do like a reel

03:29:29.500 --> 03:29:31.500
And so I was like

03:29:31.500 --> 03:29:33.500
Okay okay

03:29:33.500 --> 03:29:35.500
I'll do a reel whisper

03:29:35.500 --> 03:29:37.500
And instead I ended up doing a stage whisper

03:29:39.500 --> 03:29:41.500
Because I was too quiet

03:29:41.500 --> 03:29:43.500
I'll have to fix that up

03:29:43.500 --> 03:29:45.500
I didn't want to

03:29:47.500 --> 03:29:49.500
I didn't want to accidentally break

03:29:49.500 --> 03:29:51.500
Senpai's ears

03:29:51.500 --> 03:29:53.500
Especially if there were

03:29:53.500 --> 03:29:55.500
Those who were

03:29:55.500 --> 03:29:57.500
Who were already settled in

03:29:57.500 --> 03:29:59.500
And like relaxing and about to sleep

03:29:59.500 --> 03:30:01.500
To break any

03:30:05.500 --> 03:30:07.500
Any

03:30:11.500 --> 03:30:13.500
Any ears from me

03:30:13.500 --> 03:30:15.500
Messing around with the audio

03:30:21.500 --> 03:30:23.500
Who was I watching

03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:25.500
I wasn't

03:30:25.500 --> 03:30:27.500
I'm aware of

03:30:27.500 --> 03:30:29.500
I'm aware of them

03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:31.500
Since I

03:30:31.500 --> 03:30:33.500
Had some maro suggesting

03:30:33.500 --> 03:30:35.500
To check them out

03:30:35.500 --> 03:30:37.500
So I'm aware of them

03:30:37.500 --> 03:30:39.500
Who did I watch

03:30:47.500 --> 03:30:49.500
I was watching

03:30:49.500 --> 03:30:51.500
Petra

03:30:51.500 --> 03:30:53.500
Cool

03:30:53.500 --> 03:30:55.500
Petra

03:30:55.500 --> 03:30:57.500
I was watching Petra's

03:30:57.500 --> 03:30:59.500
ASMRs

03:31:03.500 --> 03:31:05.500
And I thought

03:31:05.500 --> 03:31:07.500
Petra's audios

03:31:07.500 --> 03:31:09.500
Were kind of

03:31:09.500 --> 03:31:11.500
Kind of more quiet

03:31:11.500 --> 03:31:13.500
So I decided to go with more quiet

03:31:13.500 --> 03:31:15.500
And I matched and I did some tests before stream

03:31:15.500 --> 03:31:17.500
So I matched

03:31:17.500 --> 03:31:19.500
The audio and how it jumped

03:31:19.500 --> 03:31:21.500
In OBS

03:31:21.500 --> 03:31:23.500
Her audios

03:31:23.500 --> 03:31:25.500
The regular volume

03:31:25.500 --> 03:31:27.500
With my audios and they matched

03:31:27.500 --> 03:31:29.500
And I was like okay, we're good

03:31:29.500 --> 03:31:31.500
And turned out they don't match on stream

03:31:31.500 --> 03:31:33.500
So that sucked

03:31:35.500 --> 03:31:37.500
So I

03:31:37.500 --> 03:31:39.500
Kind of copied Petra

03:31:39.500 --> 03:31:41.500
Sorry

03:31:43.500 --> 03:31:45.500
I suck

03:31:45.500 --> 03:31:47.500
Yeah, I'm sorry

03:31:47.500 --> 03:31:49.500
I copied Petra a little bit

03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:51.500
Because I was like okay, well Petra did this stuff

03:31:51.500 --> 03:31:53.500
And I looked at some other

03:31:53.500 --> 03:31:55.500
ASMR tubers

03:31:55.500 --> 03:31:57.500
Who I don't remember, but I definitely referenced

03:31:57.500 --> 03:31:59.500
A lot of Petra's stuff

03:32:05.500 --> 03:32:07.500
Inspired, yeah

03:32:07.500 --> 03:32:09.500
How dare you, yeah

03:32:09.500 --> 03:32:11.500
When I say stole

03:32:11.500 --> 03:32:13.500
It's more like matching audio

03:32:13.500 --> 03:32:15.500
Matching types of audio

03:32:17.500 --> 03:32:19.500
And seeing

03:32:19.500 --> 03:32:21.500
The audio levels were

03:32:21.500 --> 03:32:23.500
I don't really mean that I'm stealing

03:32:23.500 --> 03:32:25.500
Her ideas or

03:32:25.500 --> 03:32:27.500
Her triggers

03:32:27.500 --> 03:32:29.500
It's more like

03:32:29.500 --> 03:32:31.500
Seeing

03:32:31.500 --> 03:32:33.500
What the volume was like

03:32:33.500 --> 03:32:35.500
And what the pacing was

03:32:39.500 --> 03:32:41.500
And

03:32:41.500 --> 03:32:43.500
How she would go between ears

03:32:43.500 --> 03:32:45.500
And stuff

03:32:45.500 --> 03:32:47.500
Things like that

03:32:47.500 --> 03:32:49.500
Yeah, like watching

03:32:49.500 --> 03:32:51.500
The gain and matching the volume

03:32:51.500 --> 03:32:53.500
Yeah, so that's what I did

03:32:53.500 --> 03:32:55.500
But turns out it was too quiet on stream

03:32:55.500 --> 03:32:57.500
So I was like oh shit

03:32:57.500 --> 03:32:59.500
Oh shit

03:32:59.500 --> 03:33:01.500
And I didn't want to adjust it

03:33:01.500 --> 03:33:03.500
In case I adjusted

03:33:03.500 --> 03:33:05.500
I overcompensated

03:33:05.500 --> 03:33:07.500
So I was really worried

03:33:07.500 --> 03:33:09.500
About overcompensating

03:33:15.500 --> 03:33:17.500
But yeah

03:33:17.500 --> 03:33:19.500
What I ended up doing

03:33:19.500 --> 03:33:21.500
Was kind of picking my own things

03:33:21.500 --> 03:33:23.500
That I sort of liked

03:33:23.500 --> 03:33:25.500
So I basically went to the store

03:33:25.500 --> 03:33:27.500
Touched every single like

03:33:27.500 --> 03:33:29.500
Products in there and I just picked the ones

03:33:29.500 --> 03:33:31.500
That I liked the most or like I remembered

03:33:31.500 --> 03:33:33.500
That it was in the store

03:33:33.500 --> 03:33:35.500
And if it wasn't in that store

03:33:35.500 --> 03:33:37.500
I just drove

03:33:37.500 --> 03:33:39.500
Basically 30 minutes away to

03:33:39.500 --> 03:33:41.500
To

03:33:41.500 --> 03:33:43.500
To another store

03:33:43.500 --> 03:33:45.500
And then

03:33:45.500 --> 03:33:47.500
And then

03:33:47.500 --> 03:33:49.500
Drove 30 minutes back

03:33:49.500 --> 03:33:51.500
Just to get like

03:33:51.500 --> 03:33:53.500
Do you have a few products?

03:33:53.500 --> 03:33:55.500
Because I was like oh well

03:33:55.500 --> 03:33:57.500
I liked these sounds

03:33:57.500 --> 03:33:59.500
Or I liked these sounds personally

03:33:59.500 --> 03:34:01.500
So that's what I was using

03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:03.500
And then I ended up

03:34:03.500 --> 03:34:05.500
Doing a lot of

03:34:05.500 --> 03:34:07.500
Sempai suggestions

03:34:07.500 --> 03:34:09.500
And requests because I was just like

03:34:09.500 --> 03:34:11.500
Oh I don't know it

03:34:11.500 --> 03:34:13.500
Does the store sell slime?

03:34:13.500 --> 03:34:15.500
I was thinking about slime

03:34:15.500 --> 03:34:17.500
But I was

03:34:17.500 --> 03:34:19.500
Hmm

03:34:19.500 --> 03:34:21.500
I was a little worried

03:34:21.500 --> 03:34:23.500
Because I wanted something

03:34:23.500 --> 03:34:25.500
To be

03:34:25.500 --> 03:34:27.500
Um

03:34:27.500 --> 03:34:29.500
I wasn't sure

03:34:29.500 --> 03:34:31.500
If slime

03:34:31.500 --> 03:34:33.500
Was a reusable

03:34:33.500 --> 03:34:35.500
Product

03:34:35.500 --> 03:34:37.500
Does that make sense?

03:34:37.500 --> 03:34:39.500
I didn't know if it was a reusable product

03:34:39.500 --> 03:34:41.500
Because

03:34:41.500 --> 03:34:43.500
And then I also

03:34:43.500 --> 03:34:45.500
Thought about

03:34:45.500 --> 03:34:47.500
The whole YouTube thing

03:34:47.500 --> 03:34:49.500
The whole YouTube things taking down channels

03:34:49.500 --> 03:34:51.500
Usually is

03:34:51.500 --> 03:34:53.500
Yeah I don't know though

03:34:53.500 --> 03:34:55.500
Because it's like in a container and I was worried

03:34:55.500 --> 03:34:57.500
Like oh what if like slime dries out and stuff

03:34:57.500 --> 03:34:59.500
I've never really

03:34:59.500 --> 03:35:01.500
Played with slime before

03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:03.500
Does that make sense? Yeah I've never

03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:05.500
Played with slime

03:35:05.500 --> 03:35:07.500
I've never had an interest in slime

03:35:07.500 --> 03:35:09.500
I know my friends were like

03:35:09.500 --> 03:35:11.500
Oh my gosh I love slime

03:35:11.500 --> 03:35:13.500
Here's like a new one that's chocolate scented

03:35:13.500 --> 03:35:15.500
Or something and I'm like

03:35:15.500 --> 03:35:17.500
I don't get it

03:35:25.500 --> 03:35:27.500
But yeah I was like

03:35:27.500 --> 03:35:29.500
Oh maybe slime

03:35:29.500 --> 03:35:31.500
Making the squishing sound might be good

03:35:31.500 --> 03:35:33.500
But the gel

03:35:33.500 --> 03:35:35.500
The gel here

03:35:35.500 --> 03:35:37.500
The squishing sound for the gel

03:35:37.500 --> 03:35:39.500
Is

03:35:39.500 --> 03:35:41.500
Stuck between like its little

03:35:41.500 --> 03:35:43.500
Fabrics

03:35:43.500 --> 03:35:45.500
So I thought that made it

03:35:45.500 --> 03:35:47.500
Made it more

03:35:55.500 --> 03:35:57.500
Safe?

03:35:57.500 --> 03:35:59.500
Sorry

03:36:01.500 --> 03:36:03.500
I was gonna say have you thought of oil massage?

03:36:03.500 --> 03:36:05.500
I thought about it

03:36:05.500 --> 03:36:07.500
But then I was worried that I would

03:36:07.500 --> 03:36:09.500
I would ruin the 3DL

03:36:15.500 --> 03:36:17.500
Cause I was like

03:36:17.500 --> 03:36:19.500
I don't put it directly on right?

03:36:19.500 --> 03:36:21.500
Um

03:36:29.500 --> 03:36:31.500
I don't think I put it directly on

03:36:31.500 --> 03:36:33.500
So I haven't really figured that out yet

03:36:33.500 --> 03:36:35.500
I also didn't want to make a mess

03:36:35.500 --> 03:36:37.500
Because

03:36:37.500 --> 03:36:39.500
There's like a lot of

03:36:39.500 --> 03:36:41.500
I have a lot of stuff here

03:36:41.500 --> 03:36:43.500
That I don't want to get dirty

03:36:45.500 --> 03:36:47.500
Um I didn't I ended up not going

03:36:47.500 --> 03:36:49.500
With earpicks I do have a Japanese earpick

03:36:49.500 --> 03:36:51.500
Uh

03:36:51.500 --> 03:36:53.500
Because everyone does it

03:36:55.500 --> 03:36:57.500
So I wanted to

03:36:57.500 --> 03:36:59.500
Sort of differentiate

03:36:59.500 --> 03:37:01.500
My first ASMR3

03:37:01.500 --> 03:37:03.500
Just a bit

03:37:03.500 --> 03:37:05.500
Not too much

03:37:05.500 --> 03:37:07.500
Just a bit

03:37:13.500 --> 03:37:15.500
So I

03:37:15.500 --> 03:37:17.500
I don't want

03:37:17.500 --> 03:37:19.500
I didn't want to just

03:37:19.500 --> 03:37:21.500
Do it

03:37:21.500 --> 03:37:23.500
To do something

03:37:23.500 --> 03:37:25.500
Very common I suppose

03:37:25.500 --> 03:37:27.500
Because

03:37:27.500 --> 03:37:29.500
In my opinion when some people do

03:37:29.500 --> 03:37:31.500
Earpicks I did not like them

03:37:31.500 --> 03:37:33.500
I remember watching some videos going

03:37:33.500 --> 03:37:35.500
I

03:37:35.500 --> 03:37:37.500
No I don't like them

03:37:37.500 --> 03:37:39.500
So because I didn't like it myself

03:37:41.500 --> 03:37:43.500
Like I like using earpicks on myself

03:37:43.500 --> 03:37:45.500
I'm like oh this is relaxing but if like

03:37:45.500 --> 03:37:47.500
An audio was doing it

03:37:47.500 --> 03:37:49.500
I'm like

03:37:49.500 --> 03:37:51.500
Maybe not me

03:37:53.500 --> 03:37:55.500
Maybe not that

03:37:55.500 --> 03:37:57.500
And I was like oh everyone kind of

03:37:57.500 --> 03:37:59.500
Does earpicks

03:37:59.500 --> 03:38:01.500
So

03:38:03.500 --> 03:38:05.500
So

03:38:05.500 --> 03:38:07.500
I kind of wanted to differentiate myself

03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:09.500
I even got the globes

03:38:09.500 --> 03:38:11.500
The globes

03:38:11.500 --> 03:38:13.500
Uh

03:38:13.500 --> 03:38:15.500
Was in a different shape

03:38:15.500 --> 03:38:17.500
So I was hoping it would make like a different

03:38:17.500 --> 03:38:19.500
Different sound compared to what's

03:38:19.500 --> 03:38:21.500
Rather than globes

03:38:21.500 --> 03:38:23.500
So the globes I

03:38:23.500 --> 03:38:25.500
Have right now

03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:27.500
The globes I have right now are

03:38:27.500 --> 03:38:29.500
Um

03:38:29.500 --> 03:38:31.500
Are the bopple

03:38:31.500 --> 03:38:33.500
End so you know normally it'll be around

03:38:33.500 --> 03:38:35.500
Circle

03:38:35.500 --> 03:38:37.500
It was shaped of a moon

03:38:37.500 --> 03:38:39.500
It was a shape of a moon

03:38:39.500 --> 03:38:41.500
So I thought it would make a unique

03:38:41.500 --> 03:38:43.500
Sound

03:38:43.500 --> 03:38:45.500
Can I feel like the

03:38:45.500 --> 03:38:47.500
The bubbling sound

03:38:47.500 --> 03:38:49.500
Uh

03:38:49.500 --> 03:38:51.500
Made

03:38:51.500 --> 03:38:53.500
Made

03:38:53.500 --> 03:38:55.500
What lasted a bit longer

03:38:55.500 --> 03:38:57.500
In these ones

03:38:57.500 --> 03:38:59.500
Have you posed with them yet

03:38:59.500 --> 03:39:01.500
That was the first thing I did

03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:03.500
When I got home I was like

03:39:03.500 --> 03:39:05.500
Moon prism power

03:39:05.500 --> 03:39:07.500
Makeup

03:39:09.500 --> 03:39:11.500
The first thing I did

03:39:11.500 --> 03:39:13.500
When I opened them

03:39:31.500 --> 03:39:33.500
That was the first thing I did

03:39:33.500 --> 03:39:35.500
Regular orbs

03:39:35.500 --> 03:39:37.500
Like the regular ice

03:39:37.500 --> 03:39:39.500
Rollers uh on standby

03:39:39.500 --> 03:39:41.500
In case

03:39:41.500 --> 03:39:43.500
I wanted like a little bit of variety

03:39:51.500 --> 03:39:53.500
So I do have some of that

03:39:53.500 --> 03:39:55.500
I

03:39:55.500 --> 03:39:57.500
Think my biggest problem was

03:39:57.500 --> 03:39:59.500
I was worried if I placed

03:39:59.500 --> 03:40:01.500
Down the

03:40:01.500 --> 03:40:03.500
Items it would make a loud

03:40:03.500 --> 03:40:05.500
You know hold on

03:40:05.500 --> 03:40:07.500
Sound

03:40:07.500 --> 03:40:09.500
So I was like

03:40:09.500 --> 03:40:11.500
Oh shoot where did I put it

03:40:13.500 --> 03:40:15.500
I just put it in my lap

03:40:15.500 --> 03:40:17.500
Or well actually

03:40:17.500 --> 03:40:19.500
I'm wearing kind of a hoodie

03:40:19.500 --> 03:40:21.500
Right now because

03:40:25.500 --> 03:40:27.500
I put it in my

03:40:27.500 --> 03:40:29.500
In my hoodie pocket

03:40:31.500 --> 03:40:33.500
Question mercy is it

03:40:33.500 --> 03:40:35.500
Awkward to have viewers who are much older

03:40:35.500 --> 03:40:37.500
Or younger than you are

03:40:37.500 --> 03:40:39.500
Excuse me

03:40:39.500 --> 03:40:41.500
Sorry I didn't take a sip in a while

03:40:47.500 --> 03:40:49.500
Not

03:40:49.500 --> 03:40:51.500
In particular

03:40:51.500 --> 03:40:53.500
Um I do have to

03:40:53.500 --> 03:40:55.500
Say that due to the nature

03:40:55.500 --> 03:40:57.500
Of my company I would

03:40:57.500 --> 03:40:59.500
Prefer

03:40:59.500 --> 03:41:01.500
To be over 18

03:41:03.500 --> 03:41:05.500
And if you are not over 18

03:41:05.500 --> 03:41:07.500
This is not the stream for you

03:41:07.500 --> 03:41:09.500
Or at least this is not the company

03:41:09.500 --> 03:41:11.500
For you

03:41:11.500 --> 03:41:13.500
I feel like a different company

03:41:13.500 --> 03:41:15.500
Would

03:41:15.500 --> 03:41:17.500
Suffice more

03:41:23.500 --> 03:41:25.500
I don't

03:41:25.500 --> 03:41:27.500
Have any particular differences

03:41:27.500 --> 03:41:29.500
I don't feel

03:41:29.500 --> 03:41:31.500
Anything in particular

03:41:31.500 --> 03:41:33.500
Simply because

03:41:33.500 --> 03:41:35.500
I don't know I've been an entertainer

03:41:35.500 --> 03:41:37.500
And like

03:41:37.500 --> 03:41:39.500
I've been an entertainer for so long

03:41:39.500 --> 03:41:41.500
That like

03:41:41.500 --> 03:41:43.500
You know if it's an audience of

03:41:43.500 --> 03:41:45.500
All ages it just happens right

03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:55.500
So like

03:41:55.500 --> 03:41:57.500
In plays

03:41:57.500 --> 03:41:59.500
In plays and stuff

03:41:59.500 --> 03:42:01.500
Sometimes

03:42:03.500 --> 03:42:05.500
Kids and people of all ages

03:42:05.500 --> 03:42:07.500
Go to play

03:42:07.500 --> 03:42:09.500
And so sometimes

03:42:09.500 --> 03:42:11.500
You'll see like an old couple

03:42:11.500 --> 03:42:13.500
Will come in and watch a play

03:42:13.500 --> 03:42:15.500
Maybe the play is meant for like

03:42:15.500 --> 03:42:17.500
Older teens

03:42:17.500 --> 03:42:19.500
And you'll see like an old couple

03:42:21.500 --> 03:42:23.500
Old couple come

03:42:23.500 --> 03:42:25.500
And watch the play

03:42:25.500 --> 03:42:27.500
That you're performing

03:42:27.500 --> 03:42:29.500
And I feel like

03:42:29.500 --> 03:42:31.500
As an entertainer age doesn't really matter

03:42:31.500 --> 03:42:33.500
Who your audience is as long as they're entertaining

03:42:35.500 --> 03:42:37.500
So if you are on the older side

03:42:37.500 --> 03:42:39.500
I don't mind

03:42:39.500 --> 03:42:41.500
Mostly because

03:42:41.500 --> 03:42:43.500
I'm used to it

03:42:43.500 --> 03:42:45.500
It's hard to say

03:42:45.500 --> 03:42:47.500
It may sound strange

03:42:47.500 --> 03:42:49.500
Yeah maybe it's not like hard to say

03:42:49.500 --> 03:42:51.500
But it sounds strange

03:42:51.500 --> 03:42:53.500
I'm having a wide range

03:42:53.500 --> 03:42:55.500
Of

03:42:59.500 --> 03:43:01.500
People watching me

03:43:01.500 --> 03:43:03.500
In different formats

03:43:05.500 --> 03:43:07.500
So in different mediums

03:43:07.500 --> 03:43:09.500
So I've had people of all ages

03:43:09.500 --> 03:43:11.500
Watch me

03:43:13.500 --> 03:43:15.500
In movies

03:43:15.500 --> 03:43:17.500
I've had people of all ages

03:43:17.500 --> 03:43:19.500
Watch me in stage plays

03:43:19.500 --> 03:43:21.500
I've had people of all ages

03:43:21.500 --> 03:43:23.500
Watch me in like

03:43:25.500 --> 03:43:27.500
You know like even like

03:43:27.500 --> 03:43:29.500
Radio plays and stuff

03:43:29.500 --> 03:43:31.500
So it's not something

03:43:31.500 --> 03:43:33.500
That I think about

03:43:33.500 --> 03:43:35.500
Too

03:43:35.500 --> 03:43:37.500
Often

03:43:37.500 --> 03:43:39.500
I don't think about age as like a restriction

03:43:39.500 --> 03:43:41.500
Except for you know being in this company

03:43:41.500 --> 03:43:43.500
Please be over 18

03:43:49.500 --> 03:43:51.500
So

03:43:55.500 --> 03:43:57.500
So things like that

03:43:59.500 --> 03:44:01.500
So yeah

03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:03.500
Anyone all ages are welcome

03:44:03.500 --> 03:44:05.500
Except for under 18 you're not welcomed

03:44:07.500 --> 03:44:09.500
Well maybe not

03:44:09.500 --> 03:44:11.500
Not until you hit 18

03:44:11.500 --> 03:44:13.500
Then

03:44:13.500 --> 03:44:15.500
You're not ready for it yet

03:44:15.500 --> 03:44:17.500
I'm trying to say this very nicely

03:44:29.500 --> 03:44:31.500
What if I'm zero

03:44:31.500 --> 03:44:33.500
Well

03:44:33.500 --> 03:44:35.500
You're a very smart baby

03:44:35.500 --> 03:44:37.500
And I think you need to be

03:44:37.500 --> 03:44:39.500
You're too

03:44:39.500 --> 03:44:41.500
You have too much

03:44:41.500 --> 03:44:43.500
Linguist for a zero

03:44:43.500 --> 03:44:45.500
You're old baby

03:44:49.500 --> 03:44:51.500
And I think that

03:44:51.500 --> 03:44:53.500
Maybe you're possessed

03:44:53.500 --> 03:44:55.500
And that I would bring you to a priest

03:44:55.500 --> 03:44:57.500
To be exercised

03:44:57.500 --> 03:44:59.500
Hahaha

03:45:09.500 --> 03:45:11.500
Sounds like an Amy problem

03:45:11.500 --> 03:45:13.500
I know Amy's old

03:45:13.500 --> 03:45:15.500
Old enough

03:45:17.500 --> 03:45:19.500
What if I'm already at wizard's age

03:45:19.500 --> 03:45:21.500
Like what

03:45:21.500 --> 03:45:23.500
Like 30 30

03:45:23.500 --> 03:45:25.500
You become a wizard

03:45:25.500 --> 03:45:27.500
When you're like a virgin till you're 30 right

03:45:31.500 --> 03:45:33.500
Why does that matter

03:45:33.500 --> 03:45:35.500
Of course you're welcomed

03:45:39.500 --> 03:45:41.500
Of course you're welcomed

03:45:45.500 --> 03:45:47.500
Did I just reveal Amy's lollipop

03:45:47.500 --> 03:45:49.500
No

03:45:49.500 --> 03:45:51.500
No no

03:45:51.500 --> 03:45:53.500
Amy's

03:45:53.500 --> 03:45:55.500
Amy's legal

03:45:55.500 --> 03:45:57.500
You know what

03:45:57.500 --> 03:45:59.500
Fuck off, fuck off with that question

03:45:59.500 --> 03:46:01.500
Screw you

03:46:01.500 --> 03:46:03.500
Mods cussed off their testicles

03:46:03.500 --> 03:46:05.500
Mods, odia, obliterate

03:46:05.500 --> 03:46:07.500
Just kidding

03:46:07.500 --> 03:46:09.500
Just get rid of that message

03:46:21.500 --> 03:46:23.500
Hahaha

03:46:29.500 --> 03:46:31.500
I'm just saying that

03:46:31.500 --> 03:46:33.500
Uh yeah

03:46:35.500 --> 03:46:37.500
To legally be a part of the lore

03:46:37.500 --> 03:46:39.500
You must be above the age of 18

03:46:41.500 --> 03:46:43.500
So 18 in human years

03:46:45.500 --> 03:46:47.500
So both Amy and Icy

03:46:47.500 --> 03:46:49.500
Meet that threshold

03:46:51.500 --> 03:46:53.500
Or exceed it

03:46:53.500 --> 03:46:55.500
Or not, I don't know

03:46:55.500 --> 03:46:57.500
I don't actually know

03:46:57.500 --> 03:46:59.500
I don't know how old Icy is

03:46:59.500 --> 03:47:01.500
Really, but you know

03:47:01.500 --> 03:47:03.500
By the power of strongy

03:47:03.500 --> 03:47:05.500
Strongy had magical

03:47:05.500 --> 03:47:07.500
Magical siren powers

03:47:07.500 --> 03:47:09.500
And was able to tell

03:47:09.500 --> 03:47:11.500
Be like yeah yeah yeah

03:47:11.500 --> 03:47:13.500
Okay, you're in

03:47:15.500 --> 03:47:17.500
So they cleared

03:47:17.500 --> 03:47:19.500
They cleared the bar

03:47:19.500 --> 03:47:21.500
Icy is, Icy is a polar bear

03:47:21.500 --> 03:47:23.500
And uh

03:47:23.500 --> 03:47:25.500
I don't know

03:47:25.500 --> 03:47:27.500
And Amy is

03:47:27.500 --> 03:47:29.500
Like

03:47:29.500 --> 03:47:31.500
Basically an immortal, I guess

03:47:41.500 --> 03:47:43.500
So I don't know

03:47:43.500 --> 03:47:45.500
What, Amy's ages

03:47:49.500 --> 03:47:51.500
And

03:47:53.500 --> 03:47:55.500
Basically it's all

03:47:55.500 --> 03:47:57.500
You know, it's all like

03:47:57.500 --> 03:47:59.500
Everyone is at least of age

03:47:59.500 --> 03:48:01.500
Within human years

03:48:01.500 --> 03:48:03.500
And therefore can pay their taxes

03:48:11.500 --> 03:48:13.500
Her age was question mark that day

03:48:13.500 --> 03:48:15.500
If you, yeah, I don't freaking know

03:48:15.500 --> 03:48:17.500
If I don't know

03:48:17.500 --> 03:48:19.500
Just uh, if you're gonna ask ages

03:48:19.500 --> 03:48:21.500
You should ask them, not me

03:48:23.500 --> 03:48:25.500
We literally just talk about cats

03:48:25.500 --> 03:48:27.500
And maybe we talk about our feelings

03:48:27.500 --> 03:48:29.500
And we talk about like

03:48:31.500 --> 03:48:33.500
You know, girly stuff

03:48:39.500 --> 03:48:41.500
Old enough to drink, smile

03:48:41.500 --> 03:48:43.500
Old enough to pay taxes

03:48:43.500 --> 03:48:45.500
Who's dead

03:48:47.500 --> 03:48:49.500
What's that

03:48:49.500 --> 03:48:51.500
I'm about manly stuff

03:48:51.500 --> 03:48:53.500
We leave that to

03:48:53.500 --> 03:48:55.500
To...to you guys

03:48:59.500 --> 03:49:01.500
I thought you guys talked about

03:49:01.500 --> 03:49:03.500
Some demons' astronauties

03:49:03.500 --> 03:49:05.500
Yeah, that's the plan in the future

03:49:05.500 --> 03:49:07.500
Yeah, we talk about like

03:49:07.500 --> 03:49:09.500
You know

03:49:09.500 --> 03:49:11.500
Sacrifices

03:49:11.500 --> 03:49:18.500
at the daily, at the yearly violor ritual.

03:49:41.500 --> 03:49:44.500
Do you ever take the scissors out of your hair? Just curious.

03:49:44.500 --> 03:49:48.500
Yeah, I do. I just think they look cool.

03:49:48.500 --> 03:49:51.500
So they're there. They're there.

03:50:01.500 --> 03:50:03.500
Are they functional?

03:50:03.500 --> 03:50:09.500
Well, if they functioned completely, my ponytail would be chopped off.

03:50:09.500 --> 03:50:13.500
So they sort of work. See, look, hold on. Let me, like, bounce a little bit.

03:50:13.500 --> 03:50:17.500
And you can see that, like, they mostly work.

03:50:17.500 --> 03:50:22.500
They are on a little pivot point, and they do move around,

03:50:22.500 --> 03:50:28.500
but, like, I design them so that they don't fully cut my hair because...

03:50:31.500 --> 03:50:36.500
I don't know. I feel like Senpai likes my ponytail, right?

03:50:39.500 --> 03:50:42.500
Hard to tell. Can you zoom out a bit when you bounce?

03:50:42.500 --> 03:50:45.500
You can't catch me with that.

03:50:45.500 --> 03:50:49.500
I was, I was, we're, we're trying to go for monetization,

03:50:49.500 --> 03:50:52.500
so I was instructed not to show a lot of skin.

03:50:52.500 --> 03:50:59.500
Good, good try. Good try.

03:50:59.500 --> 03:51:04.500
That's why the girls have been extra careful.

03:51:04.500 --> 03:51:08.500
The girls have been extra careful recently.

03:51:08.500 --> 03:51:10.500
I don't know.

03:51:10.500 --> 03:51:12.500
I don't know.

03:51:12.500 --> 03:51:14.500
I don't know.

03:51:14.500 --> 03:51:16.500
I don't know.

03:51:16.500 --> 03:51:18.500
I don't know.

03:51:18.500 --> 03:51:21.500
Just kidding.

03:51:24.500 --> 03:51:26.500
Because we don't want to get bonked.

03:51:26.500 --> 03:51:29.500
It's already hard enough to try to get monetization,

03:51:29.500 --> 03:51:36.500
so we don't want to get bonked.

03:51:36.500 --> 03:51:39.500
Did you see Azura's bread? Yeah, I saw her bread.

03:51:39.500 --> 03:51:42.500
I was like, oh, man, I want some toast now.

03:51:42.500 --> 03:51:46.500
All milk toast sounds good, right?

03:51:46.500 --> 03:51:58.940
I love the big bow. I wish we could see it bounce more, not until everything's safe

03:51:58.940 --> 03:52:15.900
and sound. Everything's safe and sound, and then we… we still might play it safe for

03:52:15.900 --> 03:52:16.900
a little while.

03:52:16.900 --> 03:52:26.940
Who's your favorite out of the girls? I love everyone, but if I have to be like, you know,

03:52:26.940 --> 03:52:34.300
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love everyone, but in particular,

03:52:34.300 --> 03:52:45.380
I feel like I see I want to snuggle a lot more. And she just hits my, my must protect,

03:52:45.380 --> 03:53:00.380
you know, feelings. But like, um, but like, I love all the girls equally. I love all the

03:53:01.380 --> 03:53:06.420
girls equally. But if I had to pick like someone who I would like, love on more, I

03:53:06.420 --> 03:53:21.020
guess it would be Icy. Who do you love more? Icy or Senpai Senpai? Not even, not even

03:53:21.020 --> 03:53:28.860
a question. I love my Senpai more. But that being said, I love my Senpai more, but I will

03:53:28.860 --> 03:53:35.340
cut a Senpai down if they ever hurt any of the girls. If you hurt their feelings, if

03:53:35.340 --> 03:53:52.420
you try to, try to make them cry, I will. Does that make sense? I, I will show tough

03:53:52.620 --> 03:54:07.620
love to Senpai. I will show tough love to Senpai. What if I'm sparring with them? If

03:54:07.620 --> 03:54:17.100
it's like a mutual agreement that you two are sparring, yes, sure, it's fine, but if

03:54:17.140 --> 03:54:23.140
like, you know, you decide to do something a little mean, a little mean, a little cruel,

03:54:23.140 --> 03:54:34.140
I definitely do not like that. I definitely would not like that. If, if like, you know,

03:54:34.140 --> 03:54:41.500
if you start comparing someone, like, I, I don't like this particular thing is like

03:54:41.500 --> 03:54:49.020
if someone says, oh, like so and so is better than so and so, I will, we all are very charming

03:54:49.020 --> 03:54:58.220
in our own ways. And so, you know, some of the girls, including me, especially me, will

03:54:58.220 --> 03:55:06.020
get hurt if someone says things like that. And I'm sure the other girls would also feel

03:55:06.020 --> 03:55:24.620
the same way. And be very protective of each other. Well, I see it so much better than

03:55:24.620 --> 03:55:43.500
mercy die. Thank you, mods. Can we bully you in soup? Can we bully with super chat? Of

03:55:43.500 --> 03:56:00.580
course, like playful bullying is fine. Playful bullying is fine. But, you know, like real

03:56:00.580 --> 03:56:04.740
bullying, like you're trying to hurt us, you're trying to be malicious, you're trying to be

03:56:04.740 --> 03:56:12.380
rude. I do not appreciate that. And that's probably just not even like somebody who's

03:56:12.460 --> 03:56:22.260
not even a senpai, you know, teasing. Okay, of course teasing. Okay, it's playful. Your

03:56:22.260 --> 03:56:38.500
skirt's cute. I want to see it. Hi. No. So yeah. So yeah, senpai would never hurt their

03:56:38.500 --> 03:56:51.020
koi and a senpai wouldn't hurt my gen mates either. So yeah, that's my thing. I'm very

03:56:51.020 --> 03:57:02.180
protective of them. I know that due to what we do, there are some bad, bad players, bad

03:57:02.180 --> 03:57:11.100
players who've been very rude. And I've been very, very angry and curt with some rude players.

03:57:13.820 --> 03:57:25.140
So I don't, I don't appreciate, appreciate that. But otherwise, you know, anything's fine. I love

03:57:25.140 --> 03:57:38.340
my girls a lot. You've already encountered rude players, of course. Sometimes they hurt a lot,

03:57:38.860 --> 03:57:44.740
like the comments they make, sometimes they hurt a lot. You know, usually it's waters off a duck's

03:57:44.740 --> 03:57:53.700
back, but sometimes they hurt. And other times I will just be like, fuck this motherfucker.

03:57:55.860 --> 03:58:04.660
You guys get nasty marshmallows all the time. All the time. I think the only one who

03:58:09.700 --> 03:58:13.860
you have to grow tough getting in the sliding line of work, of course, I know that. But there's

03:58:13.860 --> 03:58:22.180
some days where, you know, you're not that tough, you know, you're a little bit more sensitive that

03:58:22.180 --> 03:58:28.740
day. And, and, you know, the mean things hurt a little bit more.

03:58:34.980 --> 03:58:40.820
So like all of us have, have gotten hate in some form, comments, morals, whatever.

03:58:43.140 --> 03:58:48.820
And we have each other, though, we talk about it, we talk about it, and we're like, oh, you know, if,

03:58:49.460 --> 03:58:54.820
for example, I told my gen mates, I was like, oh, there's this comment so-and-so

03:58:54.820 --> 03:59:00.180
that someone made and it really hurt my feelings. And, you know, we, we go, oh,

03:59:01.060 --> 03:59:06.100
go screw that guy. They go screw that guy. You are this and this and you're beautiful. And,

03:59:06.820 --> 03:59:12.340
you know, you are great. And mommy, mommy has to reassure me all the time, too.

03:59:18.820 --> 03:59:25.460
Mommy, mommy always, always, she's always willing to, like, repeat, repeat the love,

03:59:26.260 --> 03:59:30.660
right? Repeat the love over and over again.

03:59:37.540 --> 03:59:42.980
Yeah, mommy has definitely seen some nasty comments. I've seen nasty comments before,

03:59:43.940 --> 03:59:50.740
but I guess, you know, I'm, I still have, I still have a bit of feelings, I'm still kind of new,

03:59:50.740 --> 04:00:00.660
I'm still adjusting. So some, some comments hurt, but then some, I'm just like, yeah, you know what,

04:00:00.660 --> 04:00:15.940
screw you. But yeah, definitely, I get very protective of the, the girls. So if someone,

04:00:15.940 --> 04:00:22.420
someone purposely tries to, like, hurt them or make things very, like, scary for them, I will

04:00:22.420 --> 04:00:28.660
fucking, like, I will find your IP address. I will find your IP address. I will, I will find your

04:00:28.660 --> 04:00:39.460
mother. I will find your mother. I will send her a message. You know, that kind of thing.

04:00:43.300 --> 04:00:46.740
But most likely the company will take care of it. VLR will take care of it.

04:00:46.740 --> 04:00:58.420
VLR takes care of everything. So don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. But, you know,

04:00:58.420 --> 04:01:07.140
sometimes, you know, being what we do, there's a lot of rude players. And what I have to thank

04:01:07.140 --> 04:01:17.940
my lovely mods to who, uh, definitely works hard to, to make sure that we don't see nasty comments

04:01:17.940 --> 04:01:27.540
either. So they're very, very kind. Does it make up for it a bit when you hear about all the ways

04:01:27.540 --> 04:01:34.340
you help us get through our days? Yeah, it does. But you know, sometimes, yeah, it does. And it's

04:01:34.340 --> 04:01:42.500
a good reminder. It's a good reminder of, uh, that what we're doing is, is, makes people happy.

04:01:45.620 --> 04:01:51.780
And of course, you know, there's so much love, but sometimes one comment, you're just like, oh,

04:01:52.420 --> 04:02:02.500
that kind of hurt a lot. But most comments, honestly, most comments are, are, like, if I have

04:02:02.500 --> 04:02:17.140
to say, like, of all comments, about 99% of them is, fuck you, blocked. But like, maybe a vacation

04:02:17.140 --> 04:02:27.140
of 1%, you're like, oh, okay, that one kind of hurt. That one kind of hurt. But like, um, most of the

04:02:27.140 --> 04:02:40.900
time it's, it's, uh, it's, yeah, fuck you, whatever. Fuck you, whatever. Go back to school, kid. I don't

04:02:40.900 --> 04:02:50.900
know. Is this, is it summer break already? Go back to school. You're too young for this.

04:02:51.140 --> 04:03:00.020
Stroni seems to have nerves of steel. I'm sure Stroni has her moments too.

04:03:03.780 --> 04:03:08.580
I'm sure Stroni also has her moments. She doesn't really show it, but she probably has her moments

04:03:08.580 --> 04:03:17.140
too. After all, we're all, we're all like, you know, we're all, we're all feeling, we're all feeling beings.

04:03:21.140 --> 04:03:33.700
Honestly, actually, I notice, I notice if it's like spring break or summer break or something,

04:03:34.500 --> 04:03:42.100
uh, even, even when, uh, before I got into VLR, like spring break and like summer break would be like

04:03:42.900 --> 04:03:50.580
the mass of like little, little twerps, little, little trolls trying to, trying to get, get,

04:03:50.580 --> 04:03:57.540
get out, uh, get at you. So I just ignore. Well, it's just a time, but sometimes, I don't know,

04:03:57.540 --> 04:04:03.300
some, some, some things are like, oh shit, that kind of hurt. Oh well.

04:04:13.060 --> 04:04:18.820
Mercy, if you weren't in a fighting game, what would your intro call be? Screen for Mercy? Probably.

04:04:28.660 --> 04:04:36.980
It's my tagline. It's my tagline. Wow, what are you gonna expect? It's my tagline.

04:04:36.980 --> 04:04:45.540
So yeah, I'm just like, oh, whatever, you know, it might hurt. Today, uh, I think I'm very moody

04:04:45.540 --> 04:04:55.620
today though. I think it was a mix of being overwhelmed by the fast growth, fast growth, uh, and the,

04:04:55.620 --> 04:05:05.060
and the, um, and the, and the imposter syndrome that like today was something that was like

04:05:05.060 --> 04:05:16.660
particularly like, oh, wow, okay. Oh, but when I started playing the game and bantering with

04:05:16.660 --> 04:05:26.740
some pies, I felt much better. What would your victory line be? I'll be it.

04:05:35.380 --> 04:05:37.540
Are you playing, nervously playing with a pen right now?

04:05:38.340 --> 04:05:42.340
No.

04:05:56.820 --> 04:06:01.300
No. No, why would you say that?

04:06:07.540 --> 04:06:19.300
Oh, I didn't realize I was peeking.

04:06:22.820 --> 04:06:27.540
And that was the box cutter. It was the, it was the box cutter. Actually, it was right there.

04:06:27.540 --> 04:06:31.940
So I was nervously kind of playing with the box cutter. I was nervously playing with it because

04:06:31.940 --> 04:06:49.620
I was like, oh, I was nervous about it because, you know, thinking about, I'm like, oh, I don't,

04:06:49.620 --> 04:06:56.580
our growth was pretty fast and I, I run imposter syndrome right now and I'm full of emotions and,

04:06:56.580 --> 04:07:00.980
but I'm still like super thankful to be here, but I'm also very, very, uh,

04:07:04.340 --> 04:07:08.260
I'm very thankful to be here and I'm very happy, but I'm also just like overwhelmed.

04:07:08.260 --> 04:07:13.780
I'm overwhelmed. Uh-huh. What was the most nervous situation you've ever been in?

04:07:13.780 --> 04:07:25.780
Um, debut.

04:07:26.740 --> 04:07:37.780
Uh-huh.

04:07:45.780 --> 04:07:50.580
Honestly, before debut, I was curious and you blew all my expectations away as someone who

04:07:50.580 --> 04:07:58.260
never understood the yandere. Thank you. Thank you, Senpai.

04:08:01.300 --> 04:08:04.740
I know I'm more on the dare side of yandere.

04:08:10.500 --> 04:08:14.020
You did say you could barely walk because your legs were shaking so much. I stood up

04:08:14.580 --> 04:08:19.860
and then I collapsed onto the floor because my legs were jelly after, after debut.

04:08:20.580 --> 04:08:30.660
Um, yeah, 1 to 10, how embarrassed were you to post the, the alt, alt audio?

04:08:31.700 --> 04:08:39.300
Um, 200, 200% maybe.

04:08:42.100 --> 04:08:49.140
You don't vomit before? I didn't vomit, but I didn't have to go to IDO meetings

04:08:49.220 --> 04:08:50.740
a lot because I was so nervous.

04:08:54.500 --> 04:09:02.020
Uh, I used to vomit when I was super nervous and stressed. I used to vomit.

04:09:03.380 --> 04:09:09.540
Uh, I don't know if I told the story or if I told the girls, if I told the girls this, but

04:09:10.260 --> 04:09:16.740
um, the first time I had my, my uh,

04:09:21.780 --> 04:09:27.540
my, my driver's license, I threw up in the car,

04:09:31.060 --> 04:09:33.940
in the testing car several times.

04:09:34.740 --> 04:09:44.740
And then when I went back for the, the advanced license, it was the same, uh, driving tester

04:09:44.740 --> 04:09:49.940
person. And they were like, oh my gosh, vomit girl, welcome back.

04:09:58.180 --> 04:10:02.980
Did you pass? Not the first time. I had to come back the next day because I, I was too nervous.

04:10:04.100 --> 04:10:21.380
Uh, yeah, um, I got my license when I was like 16. And then so when I went back,

04:10:22.660 --> 04:10:28.980
when I went back for my, my license for my, my advanced license, uh,

04:10:29.380 --> 04:10:42.500
I was round 18. So the fact that it was the same guy and he remembered me after that long, I was like,

04:10:46.020 --> 04:10:52.180
look, oh my god, vomit girl, welcome back. I would expect, oh, this is around the time that you

04:10:52.180 --> 04:10:56.180
would come back for the, the license, right? I was like,

04:11:06.420 --> 04:11:10.180
not the next name that you want.

04:11:22.500 --> 04:11:26.740
It's like vomit girl. You're not going to vomit again, are you?

04:11:33.140 --> 04:11:38.180
Did you at least do it outside the car? No.

04:11:52.660 --> 04:12:01.140
Oh, he tricked me though. He tricked me because he was like, okay, we're going to just do,

04:12:03.460 --> 04:12:06.100
tell me at least there was a bag. Uh, I threw up

04:12:09.460 --> 04:12:17.220
at the testing place, uh, before. So I threw up a lot in the toilet and then I

04:12:17.220 --> 04:12:19.380
brought a bag with me and I threw up in the bag. Yeah.

04:12:22.660 --> 04:12:26.580
No, no, no, it didn't get like any, anywhere. It's just, yeah.

04:12:31.140 --> 04:12:34.580
It didn't, I didn't hit the instructor. I didn't hit the instructor.

04:12:44.020 --> 04:12:49.540
It was in a bag, but it was like, you know, something that I had to, had to grab,

04:12:50.260 --> 04:12:58.900
you know, but just happened. So, um, it just happened.

04:13:01.780 --> 04:13:06.420
The driving instructor tricked me though, tricked me. I was like, okay, we're just,

04:13:06.420 --> 04:13:13.460
we're going to just go through the route. We're going through the route that we're going to do,

04:13:13.460 --> 04:13:17.220
that we're going to do, just relax. It's not the real task. We're just going to,

04:13:18.100 --> 04:13:24.340
to go through the, um, you know, go through the route to familiarize yourself with it.

04:13:24.980 --> 04:13:29.220
You know, we went through the route and he said, your path, you passed. And I was like,

04:13:31.460 --> 04:13:32.580
you motherfucker.

04:13:32.900 --> 04:13:42.340
So, yeah, I didn't vomit cause of

04:13:54.580 --> 04:14:00.580
yeah. It's like you motherfucker. Thank you. And then I got my license. Yeah.

04:14:02.740 --> 04:14:12.660
So now you can run over your Senpai if he tries to escape.

04:14:13.700 --> 04:14:16.580
I don't even need to run over Senpai if he tries to escape.

04:14:24.660 --> 04:14:28.980
Do you guys, does my Senpai think he was just like, oh gosh, he's coming back?

04:14:33.380 --> 04:14:44.180
I should prepare for this. Or maybe he was just, or maybe the instructor was like, oh,

04:14:45.140 --> 04:14:52.100
well, this is going to happen probably more times than this, this one. So we're going to have to

04:14:52.100 --> 04:15:07.860
plan around it. I'm probably, honestly, I was probably,

04:15:10.100 --> 04:15:15.860
I was probably a learning experience for that driving instructor. Cause I barfed.

04:15:22.420 --> 04:15:32.740
I barfed and then, and then I was like, oh man. So yeah, now, and I'm a decent driver.

04:15:36.900 --> 04:15:41.060
For free, I barfed for free. No, it was the cost of my sanity.

04:15:41.780 --> 04:15:52.900
In all fairness, I could probably run on eight feet if I had to escape. My knees

04:15:52.900 --> 04:15:56.340
aren't what they used to. Of course not. They're not what they're used to after I hit them several

04:15:56.340 --> 04:16:09.620
times when they'll last escape.

04:16:10.180 --> 04:16:25.220
I should have been main out of bag. Oh my gosh, Senpai. You're kind of freaky.

04:16:27.460 --> 04:16:30.900
You're kind of freaky and I don't know how to feel about that.

04:16:40.500 --> 04:16:42.500
I don't know how to feel about that.

04:16:47.220 --> 04:16:51.380
Honestly, so many of your stories involve barfing that could be called the vomit girl

04:16:51.380 --> 04:16:55.460
veiler. No, I don't want that. I don't want that title.

04:16:59.140 --> 04:17:04.100
I don't want that title. I never realized how many, how many barf, barf stories I had.

04:17:10.580 --> 04:17:16.340
Oh man, you're right. Oh, I gave you two barf stories.

04:17:20.420 --> 04:17:22.660
No, I don't want that title.

04:17:32.660 --> 04:17:35.300
I definitely do not want that title.

04:17:40.580 --> 04:17:46.900
At least it wasn't three barf stories. I can't think of another one. These are the only two

04:17:46.900 --> 04:17:53.700
stories that I currently remember that involve vomit in some way.

04:18:00.180 --> 04:18:06.660
Oh no, except for, no, I had three stories. You're right. I told you three stories.

04:18:06.820 --> 04:18:14.260
All right, about the one time where the reason why I don't drink anymore.

04:18:14.260 --> 04:18:17.380
All right, that story. Oh, shit.

04:18:19.700 --> 04:18:26.100
Oh, shit. That was the story I told, told on, told what day, shit.

04:18:28.420 --> 04:18:31.780
Oh, you're right, Senpai. Oh no.

04:18:37.060 --> 04:18:49.540
No, I don't want to be the barf girl or the barf tuber.

04:18:54.820 --> 04:19:04.740
No, stop it, Senpai, please. Please, Senpai, stop it. I got nervous and I have allergies and

04:19:05.380 --> 04:19:07.860
and and I have motion sickness.

04:19:20.900 --> 04:19:24.100
I don't, oh, is there any other stories?

04:19:25.700 --> 04:19:31.060
Oh, it's mostly involving with my allergies, my, um,

04:19:35.140 --> 04:19:41.860
oh, don't call me Mercy, my barf, stop it.

04:19:45.220 --> 04:19:50.020
At least you showered after you barfed, right? Did I?

04:19:55.380 --> 04:19:59.060
I don't remember. I just remember that part.

04:20:05.380 --> 04:20:18.900
No, it was like, that was, that was years ago. How am I going to remember that part?

04:20:23.380 --> 04:20:28.980
I don't remember. I remember there were some days where I had such a bad allergic reaction.

04:20:28.980 --> 04:20:33.380
I just had to go to sleep. I had to sleep on my side.

04:20:34.900 --> 04:20:42.180
At the hospital because, because of that. Just remember it, forehead. I can't remember. I have,

04:20:44.100 --> 04:20:50.340
do you remember? Do you remember what you did and so and so years ago, all the details?

04:20:56.180 --> 04:21:00.740
Shut the fuck up. You're lying to me. You're lying to me. Get the shock collar.

04:21:05.700 --> 04:21:07.700
Shock collar.

04:21:14.180 --> 04:21:16.180
Ugh.

04:21:17.380 --> 04:21:19.380
Ugh.

04:21:22.820 --> 04:21:24.820
Ugh.

04:21:26.820 --> 04:21:30.980
Honestly, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I don't, I don't particularly want

04:21:31.540 --> 04:21:36.900
to be known as the barf vtuber. I haven't barfed on stream yet.

04:21:38.500 --> 04:21:47.540
So I would rather not. I barfed off stream. Oh shit. No, you're right. I had, oh shit,

04:21:47.540 --> 04:21:55.540
you're right. What I told, told senpai's about, about I got sick on the debut 2.0. That's,

04:21:55.540 --> 04:22:00.820
oh shit. That's a fourth story. You're right. Oh no.

04:22:12.020 --> 04:22:15.220
No, I'm starting to remember all the stories I'm telling senpai's.

04:22:19.220 --> 04:22:21.060
Yet, I can't tell the future, okay?

04:22:25.780 --> 04:22:29.140
It's, I'm, I'm kind of dumb.

04:22:34.100 --> 04:22:36.260
I'm kind of dumb, man.

04:22:40.420 --> 04:22:45.780
Ugh. The slave was not going to go away, is it? I'm so upset now. I'm, I'm,

04:22:50.420 --> 04:22:54.420
I'm so upset. I, I, I have many feelings right now.

04:22:56.260 --> 04:23:10.260
No, no, please, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, you know what?

04:23:10.820 --> 04:23:16.900
Conversation over. I don't like this. I don't like, I don't like the direction. I don't like how

04:23:16.900 --> 04:23:22.420
right senpai is right now. I am, I don't like it. I don't like it right now.

04:23:25.860 --> 04:23:29.860
Ugh.

04:23:33.300 --> 04:23:36.580
Stomach, stomach, stop. Cease, cease and assist.

04:23:40.020 --> 04:23:43.460
I have a sensitive stomach, okay? I just have a lot of,

04:23:44.420 --> 04:23:44.900
Ugh.

04:23:48.340 --> 04:23:56.740
New topic quick, new topic quick. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

04:23:59.860 --> 04:24:01.700
Senpai, I love you.

04:24:05.700 --> 04:24:06.900
What are you listening to in the car?

04:24:08.340 --> 04:24:11.300
Silence? The road?

04:24:14.180 --> 04:24:15.860
I did have the,

04:24:19.140 --> 04:24:22.260
yeah, dichotomy, dichotomy is the word of the day.

04:24:26.180 --> 04:24:31.620
Now I like to work in silence. Like I said, senpai, I don't really listen to music that much.

04:24:32.420 --> 04:24:40.500
I did listen to when, uh, I remember my car had a CD stuck in it because I had,

04:24:41.380 --> 04:24:41.860
um,

04:24:44.500 --> 04:24:48.340
I had, I had, uh, what was the album? Like,

04:24:55.060 --> 04:24:58.500
I was going on a road trip and what was the album?

04:24:58.820 --> 04:25:11.220
Daft Punk's Interstellar 555, like the album, the album that was, uh,

04:25:12.740 --> 04:25:15.300
that was like associated with that, that one.

04:25:16.740 --> 04:25:23.780
That one, I, I had, it was stuck. It was stuck in my car, so I just listened to it every time I trove.

04:25:28.900 --> 04:25:34.740
I had it because, uh, there was like a road trip with me and my gal pals because we were going,

04:25:34.740 --> 04:25:39.940
going to like, uh, some place, another town over for something I can't remember.

04:25:41.140 --> 04:25:47.700
So, no, they're like, oh yeah, just put on some music, you know? Uh, and I was like, oh, okay,

04:25:47.700 --> 04:25:54.740
yeah, sure. And so I, I picked up this, uh, the album. I got it from Japan, uh, from my, uh,

04:25:54.740 --> 04:25:58.820
from a music, music and books, use music and bookstore.

04:26:01.140 --> 04:26:02.900
Cole High, is this another fire story? No!

04:26:04.100 --> 04:26:10.500
It just, it was just stuck in there. I couldn't take it out. There was something wrong with the,

04:26:10.500 --> 04:26:13.780
with the CD player thing and it just wouldn't leave.

04:26:17.300 --> 04:26:19.140
Oh, it was a book off? No, it was a,

04:26:19.540 --> 04:26:27.940
uh, it was a, like, uh, it was, it was a local shop that was run by like, uh, this old lady and her,

04:26:29.140 --> 04:26:34.900
and her son. Uh, but it was mostly the old lady that was there and it was, it was like,

04:26:34.900 --> 04:26:37.780
just, uh, kind of like a little mom and pop shop.

04:26:38.500 --> 04:26:53.620
Um, my Spotify playlist is probably just like OSTs. I've been listening to the .hack OST a

04:26:53.620 --> 04:27:00.180
lot, like the anime one. That one's really good. Cole High doesn't know how to use a CD player.

04:27:00.180 --> 04:27:04.980
No, it was like legitimately broken, legitimately broken. I had to bring it back into the shop

04:27:04.980 --> 04:27:09.540
and be like, okay, my CD is stuck in there. By the way, can I get it out? And I said,

04:27:10.980 --> 04:27:14.340
ah, shit. Yeah, well, we'll work on that too.

04:27:20.020 --> 04:27:25.620
Oh, so you do listen to OSTs? Sometimes. I like working in silence a lot, but if I'm

04:27:27.140 --> 04:27:33.380
trying to evoke a mood, I will, I will probably listen to an OST.

04:27:35.860 --> 04:27:50.420
I will probably listen to the OST. So do you listen to any Nikkei OSTs? Uh, when I play Nikkei,

04:27:50.420 --> 04:27:54.660
the, the only time I ever listen to the Nikkei OST is with a Nikkei.

04:27:54.900 --> 04:28:02.020
So you don't like instrumentals? Uh,

04:28:05.620 --> 04:28:20.020
no, my favorite song in, in, um, my favorite piece in the .hack OST is, uh, what was it called?

04:28:24.660 --> 04:28:54.100
I can't remember. I can't remember the rest of the lyrics. I would remember it definitely if it was

04:28:55.660 --> 04:28:56.660
You know.

04:29:04.660 --> 04:29:06.660
I can't remember what it was. Is it Aura?

04:29:12.660 --> 04:29:16.660
Oh, the world. It was called... anyway, I don't remember.

04:29:18.660 --> 04:29:19.660
Maybe?

04:29:25.660 --> 04:29:27.660
I can't remember. I can't remember.

04:29:28.660 --> 04:29:32.660
It might be Aura, so yeah. That's the one I liked.

04:29:41.660 --> 04:29:42.660
Oh, the...

04:29:54.660 --> 04:29:57.660
But it does not mean a thing to me.

04:29:59.660 --> 04:30:00.660
Something like that.

04:30:05.660 --> 04:30:07.660
And Inuyasha had some great songs too.

04:30:07.660 --> 04:30:09.660
Yeah, I remember Inuyasha.

04:30:09.660 --> 04:30:12.660
I want to change the world.

04:30:12.660 --> 04:30:15.660
Something something can't remember the lyrics.

04:30:15.660 --> 04:30:18.660
That song was stuck in copyright hell.

04:30:25.660 --> 04:30:28.660
During the ABU, you said you wanted to record some original songs.

04:30:28.660 --> 04:30:30.660
Any hints you can give about what you've written?

04:30:33.660 --> 04:30:35.660
Where's my phone?

04:30:36.660 --> 04:30:39.660
Yeah, I listened to the near OST as well.

04:30:50.660 --> 04:30:51.660
No.

04:30:51.660 --> 04:30:53.660
It's kind of embarrassing.

04:30:53.660 --> 04:30:56.660
But yeah, I definitely love Inuyasha. Oh my gosh!

04:30:56.660 --> 04:30:59.660
Azura loves Inuyasha too, right?

04:30:59.660 --> 04:31:02.660
I think we both have our weeb awakening with Inuyasha.

04:31:07.660 --> 04:31:10.660
I remember loving Inuyasha.

04:31:10.660 --> 04:31:13.660
I had all the DVDs until someone stole it.

04:31:18.660 --> 04:31:21.660
What was it? I can't remember some of the lyrics.

04:31:23.660 --> 04:31:24.660
Yeah.

04:31:33.660 --> 04:31:34.660
Someone stole it? Yeah!

04:31:34.660 --> 04:31:37.660
My entire DVD collection!

04:31:37.660 --> 04:31:39.660
I was so upset!

04:31:41.660 --> 04:31:43.660
I was so upset I cried.

04:31:54.660 --> 04:31:57.660
I cried. I cried for days.

04:31:57.660 --> 04:32:00.660
And I knew exactly who fucking stole it.

04:32:00.660 --> 04:32:02.660
I know who stole it.

04:32:02.660 --> 04:32:06.660
And that little son of a... son of a bitch...

04:32:06.660 --> 04:32:08.660
Moved the next day!

04:32:08.660 --> 04:32:11.660
I knew it was that little shit stain!

04:32:17.660 --> 04:32:20.660
How did someone steal your entire DVD collection?

04:32:20.660 --> 04:32:23.660
How did someone steal your entire DVD collection?

04:32:30.660 --> 04:32:32.660
Did I just stole it?

04:32:36.660 --> 04:32:38.660
It was when I was really young.

04:32:38.660 --> 04:32:40.660
So it was this kid.

04:32:40.660 --> 04:32:43.660
And I definitely know he fucking stole it.

04:32:43.660 --> 04:32:46.660
Because he visited the house that day.

04:32:46.660 --> 04:32:48.660
And I was like...

04:32:48.660 --> 04:32:51.660
Oh yeah! I'm moving! Let's hang out!

04:32:51.660 --> 04:32:54.660
And the next day my entire collection was gone!

04:32:58.660 --> 04:33:00.660
That little fucking shit stain.

04:33:00.660 --> 04:33:02.660
I'll fucking kill that little bitch.

04:33:02.660 --> 04:33:03.660
What?

04:33:15.660 --> 04:33:18.660
I didn't realize it was gone until like that little...

04:33:18.660 --> 04:33:20.660
Snake...

04:33:20.660 --> 04:33:22.660
Was gone.

04:33:26.660 --> 04:33:28.660
Until that little snake was gone.

04:33:28.660 --> 04:33:31.660
And then ever since then I was just like...

04:33:31.660 --> 04:33:35.660
I don't trust anyone with my things.

04:33:35.660 --> 04:33:37.660
Parents did nothing?

04:33:37.660 --> 04:33:38.660
Oh they tried!

04:33:38.660 --> 04:33:41.660
But that little shit stain moved someplace we didn't know.

04:33:41.660 --> 04:33:43.660
Where they moved, you know?

04:33:52.660 --> 04:33:53.660
They were just gone.

04:33:53.660 --> 04:33:55.660
Yeah, they were gone.

04:33:55.660 --> 04:33:57.660
Like how am I supposed to know?

04:33:57.660 --> 04:33:58.660
Right?

04:34:02.660 --> 04:34:05.660
So I was really upset.

04:34:05.660 --> 04:34:07.660
I had all the movies.

04:34:07.660 --> 04:34:09.660
I had all of it.

04:34:09.660 --> 04:34:11.660
I was so upset.

04:34:11.660 --> 04:34:16.660
My sister bought me all the movies.

04:34:16.660 --> 04:34:19.660
And it wasn't cheap.

04:34:19.660 --> 04:34:21.660
Those DVDs weren't cheap.

04:34:27.660 --> 04:34:30.660
So I dealt with a lot of shit.

04:34:30.660 --> 04:34:32.660
I dealt with a lot of shit.

04:34:32.660 --> 04:34:34.660
I dealt with a lot of shit.

04:34:36.660 --> 04:34:39.660
Like I dealt with a lot of shit as a kid so I'm really pissed.

04:34:39.660 --> 04:34:42.660
I'm mad thinking about it all over again!

04:34:42.660 --> 04:34:44.660
I'm getting...

04:34:50.660 --> 04:34:52.660
I'm really upset now.

04:34:52.660 --> 04:34:54.660
If you're on maybe start the collection again.

04:34:54.660 --> 04:34:56.660
I don't...

04:34:56.660 --> 04:34:59.660
I don't feel like starting the collection again.

04:34:59.660 --> 04:35:01.660
I'm just mad.

04:35:01.660 --> 04:35:03.660
In general, they had like...

04:35:03.660 --> 04:35:05.660
Okay, like...

04:35:05.660 --> 04:35:09.660
The DVDs I had would have like the limited edition cards.

04:35:09.660 --> 04:35:12.660
And like they're the special coin.

04:35:12.660 --> 04:35:16.660
That was so cool, like the special memento coin.

04:35:16.660 --> 04:35:19.660
I don't sell those fucking shit anymore.

04:35:26.660 --> 04:35:28.660
That was just really upsetting.

04:35:29.660 --> 04:35:30.660
So upsetting.

04:35:30.660 --> 04:35:32.660
So upsetting to this day.

04:35:33.660 --> 04:35:35.660
If I ever find that fucking little kid again,

04:35:35.660 --> 04:35:38.660
I'll fucking like curb stomp that little shit.

04:35:38.660 --> 04:35:40.660
That little shit's probably an adult now.

04:35:40.660 --> 04:35:45.660
Curb stomp, stomp him against them, whatever.

04:35:47.660 --> 04:35:49.660
Did you like this point? No!

04:35:55.660 --> 04:35:57.660
No, I didn't!

04:36:00.660 --> 04:36:03.660
No, he just came by and said,

04:36:03.660 --> 04:36:05.660
Yeah, I'm moving because we used to play

04:36:05.660 --> 04:36:08.660
all together as a neighborhood kid.

04:36:08.660 --> 04:36:10.660
Right?

04:36:12.660 --> 04:36:15.660
Like all the kids in the neighborhood would just play together

04:36:15.660 --> 04:36:17.660
and then this kid was going through

04:36:17.660 --> 04:36:19.660
to every single fucking person's house

04:36:19.660 --> 04:36:21.660
and was like, oh yeah, I just want to hang out a bit

04:36:21.660 --> 04:36:23.660
because I'm moving, blah blah blah.

04:36:23.660 --> 04:36:25.660
That little shit probably took something from everyone.

04:36:30.660 --> 04:36:32.660
I'm still mad thinking about it.

04:36:49.660 --> 04:36:51.660
Probably still from fucking everyone.

04:36:51.660 --> 04:36:55.660
I know, I know some of, I know there was a family

04:36:55.660 --> 04:36:57.660
in my neighborhood that got banned

04:36:57.660 --> 04:37:00.700
in my neighborhood that got banned from everyone's frickin' house.

04:37:01.420 --> 04:37:04.620
Oh, I'm still mad. I'm still mad. There's this, uh...

04:37:05.500 --> 04:37:07.500
So, there's a house, uh...

04:37:08.700 --> 04:37:12.700
And these kids were not exactly the greatest, and, uh...

04:37:12.940 --> 04:37:22.780
Oh, they were- they reached an all- all time low one time when they- when for some reason, uh, Papa Mercy was like,

04:37:22.780 --> 04:37:24.780
Okay, you know, maybe they've changed.

04:37:25.820 --> 04:37:29.100
Maybe they've changed. Let's invite them to your birthday, and I said,

04:37:29.180 --> 04:37:33.020
Fuck no, and then he did it anyways, and they stole my birthday presents.

04:37:35.660 --> 04:37:37.900
It's like, fuck those kids, too.

04:37:41.100 --> 04:37:46.140
Not like, you know, but like, I- I'd fucking, like, curb-stop them.

04:37:52.780 --> 04:37:55.580
And... okay.

04:37:58.940 --> 04:38:00.940
And the worst part was that...

04:38:02.780 --> 04:38:04.780
We went to the parents.

04:38:05.900 --> 04:38:11.100
Listen, listen. We went to the parents. Like, my mama and papa went to the parents.

04:38:13.260 --> 04:38:17.340
And... was like, hey, your kids, they stole the presents.

04:38:18.540 --> 04:38:22.220
And, you know, clearly they're playing with the fucking presents.

04:38:23.260 --> 04:38:31.660
Um, you know what the audacity of the fucking parents did? They said, oh, we bought it. We bought it for them.

04:38:44.860 --> 04:38:46.860
I was so pissed.

04:38:53.340 --> 04:38:55.340
Mmm, I- mmm.

04:38:56.540 --> 04:38:59.500
I think the police were called and everything, and like, the police were like,

04:38:59.500 --> 04:39:03.660
Okay, we can't do anything about it, because you can't prove that it was like yours or something, and I was like,

04:39:03.660 --> 04:39:05.660
Ah, your son.

04:39:20.220 --> 04:39:28.060
And so, and so, like, I know that family is like banned completely. They are shunned in the neighborhood.

04:39:34.620 --> 04:39:37.100
I was so upset. I was so upset.

04:39:39.260 --> 04:39:41.260
Ugh.

04:39:43.020 --> 04:39:47.820
I was so upset. Like, honestly, they were completely shunned. They stole- they stole from everyone.

04:39:50.860 --> 04:39:56.620
They stole from everyone. When police got involved, like, they're like, oh, you can't prove that they did it, right? And I'm like,

04:39:59.340 --> 04:40:01.340
The fuck you mean? I can't fucking prove it.

04:40:04.540 --> 04:40:10.780
They still live in the neighborhood. I glare at them every once in a while.

04:40:15.740 --> 04:40:22.540
Oh no, that was a different family. Gosh, I hate this. I hate that it was like two different families.

04:40:22.540 --> 04:40:24.540
I

04:40:27.980 --> 04:40:35.900
Actually, ever since then, I'm not going to lie. I had a really bad rebellious streak. Like, I was pretty much a delinquent.

04:40:41.020 --> 04:40:46.780
Yeah, like, they would- I have like, you know, cameras and stuff now.

04:40:46.780 --> 04:40:54.620
But I would never forgive them. I won't ever forgive them. Nothing has fucking changed.

04:40:56.540 --> 04:40:59.260
Wait, nothing has changed? Are you talking about my delinquent self?

04:41:10.140 --> 04:41:15.420
I think I calmed down quite a bit. I give- I give people more chances than not.

04:41:16.780 --> 04:41:19.900
I did have a very violent streak growing up.

04:41:23.100 --> 04:41:32.140
I did, I did, but I think I'm quite- I think I'm- I'm more lenient now, Senpai. You should be- you should be grateful for that.

04:41:37.100 --> 04:41:39.100
Like, I was-

04:41:41.020 --> 04:41:45.260
I was pretty ruthless back then. Pretty ruthless.

04:41:47.020 --> 04:41:51.020
How many people did you beat up?

04:41:57.260 --> 04:41:59.660
Let's skip that question. Let's skip that question.

04:42:03.820 --> 04:42:05.820
Let's skip that question.

04:42:12.140 --> 04:42:14.140
Let's skip that question.

04:42:15.100 --> 04:42:25.100
I will say that one time, when I was doing- I was doing an exam, uh-

04:42:25.900 --> 04:42:36.540
Somebody asked me for my name. Like, the person who sat next to me

04:42:39.820 --> 04:42:48.700
said, um, my name. And I said my name, and they said, from- from- from so-and-so

04:42:49.580 --> 04:42:56.300
School, and I said, huh? How do you know me? And they moved four- four fucking seats away from me. Okay?

04:42:56.300 --> 04:43:02.300
Let's just say- let's just say that- that's enough. That's enough, okay?

04:43:02.300 --> 04:43:04.300
Okay?

04:43:16.460 --> 04:43:25.900
So, uh, I didn't know them. I didn't know them, but they said so-

04:43:27.180 --> 04:43:30.060
Mercy? Mercy from so-and-so School?

04:43:31.020 --> 04:43:33.020
Yeah?

04:43:39.580 --> 04:43:41.580
Four seats away!

04:43:50.380 --> 04:43:56.380
Um, what do you mean? Any advice? I was- I was very-

04:43:57.340 --> 04:44:05.340
Honestly, I was very ruthless. I was very ruthless. I did things that I feel very- a lot of shame for.

04:44:10.860 --> 04:44:16.380
Maybe it was scared of you to throw up on him. Oh, no. No, I didn't have that reputation.

04:44:17.580 --> 04:44:19.580
Now I did. Thanks to this stream.

04:44:22.380 --> 04:44:24.380
Um.

04:44:27.340 --> 04:44:39.340
I don't think I'm personally any, uh, I don't think personally I have, like, uh, an aura of someone who's, like, violent.

04:44:43.340 --> 04:44:55.340
But, uh, I definitely have a little bit- I- I did make a bit of a name for myself in my youth.

04:44:57.340 --> 04:45:05.340
Because I was definitely very much delinquent. Like, yeah.

04:45:07.340 --> 04:45:09.340
I'm not violent.

04:45:16.380 --> 04:45:18.380
I don't have a violent aura.

04:45:18.380 --> 04:45:30.380
I don't! I don't! I've calmed down quite a bit, Senpai. So Senpai should be thankful. I've calmed down quite a bit.

04:45:36.380 --> 04:45:46.380
I've- I've definitely calmed down quite a bit, but I- I definitely had a delinquent day. Like,

04:45:49.340 --> 04:46:03.340
like, thinking like the kind of, like, you know, think, like, typical Japanese, like, delinquent. Think about it like that.

04:46:07.340 --> 04:46:09.340
Something like that.

04:46:10.300 --> 04:46:26.300
I've changed quite a bit since then. I've definitely apologized quite a bit for back then.

04:46:30.300 --> 04:46:32.300
Yeah.

04:46:33.260 --> 04:46:39.260
What's the worst thing you've done? I don't want to say. I don't want to say what's the worst thing I've done.

04:46:39.260 --> 04:46:43.260
That is, uh, nope. No, we're not gonna answer that.

04:46:47.260 --> 04:46:49.260
I'm not gonna answer that.

04:46:49.260 --> 04:46:51.260
Let's just say-

04:46:55.260 --> 04:46:59.260
Let's just say that, um, it was-

04:47:03.260 --> 04:47:11.260
No, no. Actually, I'm not even gonna hint to what it was.

04:47:13.260 --> 04:47:15.260
Yeah, it was just Jay walking.

04:47:25.260 --> 04:47:29.260
There are definitely things that will remind me of that moment, so I just go-

04:47:30.220 --> 04:47:40.220
So, yeah, I feel- I feel quite a bit ashamed about that.

04:47:41.180 --> 04:48:01.180
Oh, yeah. The crosswalk was never the same. Nope, it wasn't.

04:48:05.180 --> 04:48:07.180
Yeah, I feel like you definitely had to put things in the past.

04:48:07.180 --> 04:48:11.180
Yeah, yeah, I feel like that, too. That's why I'm just like, I don't want to talk about it.

04:48:11.180 --> 04:48:15.180
I don't want to talk about it because, um-

04:48:18.140 --> 04:48:20.140
I don't want- I'm moving on from that.

04:48:30.140 --> 04:48:32.140
I'm moving on from that.

04:48:33.100 --> 04:48:39.100
No, it is not something that I would probably be put to jail for.

04:48:39.100 --> 04:48:43.100
No, no, no, no, no. Nothing- nothing that- that- that bad.

04:48:45.100 --> 04:48:47.100
It's nothing that bad.

04:48:49.100 --> 04:48:51.100
And nothing like, you know-

04:48:55.100 --> 04:48:57.100
Um-

04:48:58.060 --> 04:49:02.060
Nothing that's like FBI would be like, oh, okay, we can't find my outlawner.

04:49:06.060 --> 04:49:10.060
But it wasn't bad morally, but it was- it would have definitely-

04:49:14.060 --> 04:49:16.060
It would have definitely-

04:49:21.100 --> 04:49:26.060
Let's just say it- it definitely, uh, was- was put on a record.

04:49:28.060 --> 04:49:30.060
It was- was put on a record.

04:49:34.060 --> 04:49:36.060
In my youth.

04:49:36.060 --> 04:49:38.060
Yeah, let's move on.

04:49:38.060 --> 04:49:40.060
Let's move on. Fuck it.

04:49:48.060 --> 04:49:52.060
If there was a place I could talk about it, it would be with my closest peers.

04:49:53.020 --> 04:49:57.020
And unfortunately, I want my best face for my senpai.

04:50:05.020 --> 04:50:07.020
My best face for my senpais.

04:50:23.020 --> 04:50:31.020
So, yeah. Yeah, sorry to- to like, just cut that off right there.

04:50:39.020 --> 04:50:42.060
Sorry to cut that conversation off right there.

04:50:42.060 --> 04:50:44.060
Like, I just- I just don't want to think about it.

04:50:44.060 --> 04:50:46.060
Um-

04:50:47.020 --> 04:50:49.020
Now I'm thinking about it.

04:50:49.020 --> 04:50:51.020
Now I'm in a bad mood.

04:50:51.020 --> 04:50:53.020
You know what?

04:50:53.020 --> 04:50:55.020
You know what?

04:50:55.020 --> 04:50:57.020
Let's-

04:50:57.020 --> 04:50:59.020
Let's just take the day off right now.

04:50:59.020 --> 04:51:03.020
I think- I think- I think I streamed quite a- quite a bit.

04:51:05.020 --> 04:51:07.020
I think I streamed quite a bit.

04:51:09.020 --> 04:51:11.020
Diligence?

04:51:11.980 --> 04:51:15.980
Diligence was yesterday's cool word.

04:51:15.980 --> 04:51:21.980
This- this today's, uh, cool word as dichotomy.

04:51:25.980 --> 04:51:27.980
Sorry, kahai. No, it's okay.

04:51:27.980 --> 04:51:29.980
It's- it's- it's me.

04:51:29.980 --> 04:51:31.980
It's me for like, uh, what do you call it?

04:51:37.980 --> 04:51:39.980
It's me for like, lingering.

04:51:40.940 --> 04:51:42.940
Lingering on it.

04:51:44.940 --> 04:51:46.940
Stop calling me barf girl.

04:51:50.940 --> 04:51:54.940
I just want senpais to know that I am-

04:51:54.940 --> 04:52:00.940
I am the- the- a much different person than I was back then.

04:52:01.900 --> 04:52:09.900
And I want to stay in this good position.

04:52:19.900 --> 04:52:21.900
So I love you senpai.

04:52:21.900 --> 04:52:23.900
I love you so much.

04:52:23.900 --> 04:52:27.900
We'll see each other again tomorrow.

04:52:31.900 --> 04:52:35.900
And, uh, is there anything else I need to say?

04:52:35.900 --> 04:52:39.900
Like, subscribe, leave a comment.

04:52:41.900 --> 04:52:45.900
I forgot to say that, like, the last few streams.

04:52:45.900 --> 04:52:47.900
I remember.

04:52:47.900 --> 04:52:49.900
I remember Manny sounds like, oh yeah, don't forget to-

04:52:49.900 --> 04:52:51.900
don't forget to like, say that.

04:52:51.900 --> 04:52:53.900
And I'm like, oh, okay.

04:52:55.900 --> 04:52:57.900
All right.

04:52:58.860 --> 04:53:02.860
Thank you senpais.

04:53:02.860 --> 04:53:04.860
Oh, by the way, the story before?

04:53:04.860 --> 04:53:06.860
Forgetty Beam.

04:53:06.860 --> 04:53:10.860
It's now forgotten out of your memory and will not be brought up again.

04:53:10.860 --> 04:53:12.860
Got it?

04:53:20.860 --> 04:53:24.860
I love you senpai.

04:53:28.860 --> 04:53:30.860
Okay.

04:53:32.860 --> 04:53:34.860
Good night.

04:53:34.860 --> 04:53:36.860
Scream for Mercy.

04:53:36.860 --> 04:53:38.860
I hope this isn't as loud as last time.

04:53:38.860 --> 04:53:40.860
Let's go. Bye.

04:53:57.900 --> 04:54:00.860
Thank you.
