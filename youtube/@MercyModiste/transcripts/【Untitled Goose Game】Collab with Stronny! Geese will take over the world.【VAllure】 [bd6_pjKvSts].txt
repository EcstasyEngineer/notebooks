power washer but mersey gets first person motion sick so we actually can't quite play power washer
the way others might this danie reset reset are we lobby i have no idea i have streamed the game
audio to you so i don't know why your discord discord can't hear the audio as well my discord
can't hear the audio and oh i the monitor sound is as high as it can and if it if i make it any higher
you're going to you're going to sound a lot i'm going to be a bit too much now don't get me wrong
i do appreciate stop streaming simply turn turn on webcam i said turn on webcam i don't think mersey
wants to see that first thing in the morning i'm going to be honest um if i can move this up maybe
you know i wish there was a way to like separate audio between like this i actually like the voice
caller you totally didn't notice that oh i totally didn't notice that's actually because i fucked up
right untill this game also share application audio yes at mersey right go live and then go on
discord and open up that stream that i've just given you if that does not give you the audio i
am stumped for what we're supposed to do okay oh i can hear it can senpai's hear that it might be a
little low i heard it it's such a quiet honk oh boy you can hear moe quonk okay hold on let me
wait if it's too quiet i wonder why it's too quiet
how about that how about that it's still quiet but it's here they said it's a little low
the tiniest honk oh no i can't move my volume any any higher either that's the problem
um maybe if i can move the monitor sound up
i mean i could do it one more time one more time needs to celebrate i can
okay do you hear that bell i heard a bell the tolling bell is coming for us
okay yeah input for some reason mersey can also control me in the game i don't i don't know how
you've managed that but we have

right do we need to go through the fence we do we'll probably have to go through the
the tiny little thing again there's only one map this game was so expensive and you're telling me
there was one map we love causing problems on purpose all right all right i'm in a better
hunker i said it uh these are the cabbages right was that a pumpkin i thought it was a pumpkin
do we need pumpkins or cabbages i'm gonna grab this one
okay i got it no i don't want to let the farmer back in

following you there you go okay yes we need pumpkin i don't know if there's like jam in the
garden somewhere i need probably but you got the pumpkin uh yes we can mark pumpkin off the
what is this a monument i'm at oh it is a monument it's like a little shrine oh wow okay the gate

there we needed a carrot for the the i want to kill it yeah are we kill it i want to kill it let
hello let's trigger me yeah that's it let's trigger me

i'm not gonna have to distract him i think i am hold on let me get this one
give us the carrot give us the carrot give it back it's not yours

oh no i have terrible news i think we're actually gonna have to reset
i don't think i can play with these controls
okay it's okay i'm willing to reset
yes okay we can probably speedrun this to be honest i have no idea
so hold on i'm gonna hide my game just in case i show anything that shit i'm not
i need to hide my game input uh
if i quit and then invite you on local co-op that should work right sure
i'm gonna hide my game too just in case my game capture now sometimes can't can't you can't see
do funny things oh you've done mouse and keyboard did you mean to do that
wait no that was me that did that was you it was yes it was me i was like
hmm you did that so fast mercy i don't remember inviting you hmm
i think it's because we're still there are you still in this instance
or did i need to send you a new instance
no that was you that was that was you okay i think it should be fine now
okay hold on all right you move around
and let's get out of this bush first oh yeah they are blind hold on what
dream capture gooski i will wow how bizarre
wait is this like is this a bug
how strange right i'm just going to do mouse and keyboard give me one more shot mercy one more
shot okay one more shot give me one more chance i will do mouse and keyboard and because i think
that's what's clashing for some random reason take that out i don't need that in my pc
okay begin two player i would like to use mouse and keyboard and i will use i may use controller
okay we did it you need to probably swap who player one is i was player one last time i think
okay space bar is honk i mean you need to quickly relearn all of the
maybe are we the only one's an experience to ever have this bug before
this is crazy oh my god game literally unplayable do you think i can get a refund
how right how did i make you am i am i one more powerful give me literally give me one more chance

We're done, okay
Oh no! Look! She drew knee ducts on this. That's really rude. I didn't even appreciate that.
No, let's get one thing straight.
Oh. Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Give me that.
Oh, lady!
Oh, Azara! Thank you for the raid!
She opened up a gate. Did we go through the gate?
I think we did it.
Granny got new knees. No wonder she's so fat. Yeah.
Man, screw this place. I'm going home.
We're gonna screw this place. We need trouble anywhere else.
Mmm. You're so rude.
Azara, welcome! Welcome, Raiders! Welcome to the stream of chaos!
Why?
Uh, left or right?
Oh, you're all right?
Oh, there's a pond!
Mmm, water.
Water.
Uh...
Daily clave.
Whoa! I saw that.
I saw that.
Is there a complete Little Nightmare confirmation?
Confirmation time.
Confirmation any Little Nightmare-ers?
We love dino-nuggies.
Hello, mister.
I'm playing with your lacrosse.
Uh, well, I do objectives. Let's see what our objectives are.
Make someone break the fancy vase.
Help the woman dress up the bust.
Make the man spit out his tea.
Get dressed up with a ribbon.
Make the man go barefoot.
Do the washing.
What?!
Are we supposed to go into, like, different gardens?
Oh, wait! This is the man spit out his tea.
Um...
Yeah, here's your hat.
How do we make someone spit their tea out?
That's so specific.
Get trapped, nerd.
Okay, he keeps taking his hat back, but how do we...
Maybe if we wait for him to get his tea, and then he won't get him.
Ah, I'm off work.
Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, agreed.
Okay, let's watch this gentleman try and have his tea.
Well, hello there.
There's a lady across the fence. Hi! Are you friendly?
Probably, no.
Is anyone friendly, honestly? I don't think so.
Special rules.
Oh, ribbon!
Ta-da!
Uh, uh...
Hello?
Make her break the vase!
Oh, the vase, the vase!
See this fucking thing?
Man, fuck this thing.
I'm putting this one thing in particular. Uh, everything else.
Oh, her wee bra's on the line.
I know she got wee socks as well.
Wah.
Uh...
I'm stoke. I'm stoke.
Hello? No, no, no, no.
No, hold on. The camera movement's making me a little bit deezy.
Oh, no!
Are you feeling a bit sick?
Yeah, just give me a moment.
If you feel too sick, it's okay. We can post-trap.
I ain't gonna force you to play if you feel sick.
I didn't realize the camera was so unsteady.
Yeah, it was just like...
Aw, this is so cute.
We can just do this in the film.
She's staring at me!
Is she gonna break it?
No.
Oh! Oh my god, let me dress you up!
Okay!
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait, that's our mare's knee.
That's literally our bow. That's her entire design.
Listen, I have a bow on my chest!
Exactly.
And technically, your bow and your skirt is your skirt?
Yeah, it is on the back of your skirt, as I don't...
Oh, there's like a wee frog thing.
Oh, a little inter-
Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to...
Take your thing.
Is it a bell?
Uh, why do you even have that, lady?
Is that how we break the statue?
Does she notice I have the bow?
No, I notice she doesn't have it, I promise.
I have the soap.
Wait, this is a bathroom and...
This is a garden, it's a bathroom!
Uh, no!
This isn't a bathtub, lady.
This isn't a lifeguard's seat.
Aw, no, that's not the meme, why is it?
This is a bathtub.
This isn't a beach, it's a bathtub!
Yes, yes, that's it!
What's in the drawer?
Oh, sorry about that.
Oh, chap, didn't really mean to do that, but hey, hold on, we're here now.
I love causing problems on purpose.
Whomp, whomp.
Whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp.
I don't...
I assume I can put it on you, essentially.
But...
What a bizarre...
Come here, come here.
I can put it on you?
I thought I could put it on you.
Oh, I'm just joined it from you.
Oh, we're just passing it mathematically, excuse me.
Oh, we're just like, here you go, no, you have it, no, you have it, no, you have it.
You hang up, you hang up, you hang up.
Uh, I don't know how to get her to break this.
Um, no, she's always gonna have it.
She goes to an idol meeting in the open, literally.
How, what is, maybe we go in another garden for now.
Wait, can we even get out of here?
Wait, we can't even get out until we progress through this stage?
Our section?
There is a gate here.
Hello, Mr. Gate.
That is not going to work.
Can we put this on you?
We have...
I don't know if you can.
I like the way we both look down at it.
We're like, hmm, hmm, that's not the way it should be.
Okay, why can I not put it on you?
Oh, oh, oh, you're so aggressive.
No, I'm like trying so hard to put it on you right now.
Maybe, oh, wait, wait, wait, oh, maybe if I move the duck, if we move the geese.
And you be the duck?
Yeah, and I'll be the, I'll be the inch.
Oh, I like this idea.
And then I stand there and then she puts it on me.
Unless you're going to constantly put it.
Okay, right, I'll let her pick that up.
And then I'm going to yank this away.
No, you don't care about this.
Okay, look, it's hidden.
No, I just clicked off the game and you stopped doing that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, grab the ribbon, grab the ribbon.
Where is it?
I'm trying.
Oh, no, you've got me, lady.
Wait, does she know that?
Yeah.
She knew.
That was.
I want the ribbon.
Wait, what?
How does she know that's not possible?
What is on me?
Fine.
But the game literally says to put her there.
The table we broke, something about the table we broke.
Hold on, what's up with the table?
We're looking at our table now.
This one.
Oh, it's how we get out.
We go up the table now to go into another garden.
Oh, OK.
You're going to move on to the next one and we can come back to this.
We'll come back to the garden as soon as we share the mister.
We call her Miss Crackpot because we have to crack her pot.
Hi.
Do you have a cup of tea by any chance for us little geeseling?
We really like your lacrosse.
We do.
Do you want to have some tea, a bit of tea?
No, no tea.
OK, jeez.
It's hard to impress these people, clearly.
Does he have a sip of tea, maybe?
Come on, let's watch him.
Hello.
Hello?
He doesn't.
He really looking at us like, can I help you?
Yeah, actually, you're a mission objective.
We're not doing it.
We're not up to no good.
No.
I'm just I'm just crouching around in your garden.
I ain't doing nothing.
We're doing what we watched.
We're watched through the fence.
He can't see us, but we can see him.
We're we're such we're such bad geese.
Literally.
What is going on?
Night night.
Wait, why is he so?
Why is he so suspicious?
But yeah, he's paranoid.
He like can't even enjoy his tea.
Come on, drink your tea, sir.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
He's rubbing his knees.
Rubbing his knees.
Yeah.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
No, you're supposed to spell it, my good sir.
Did I not give you a fright doing that?
All right, take a sip.
Take it.
Hey.
Wait, that was what we wanted?
Wait, we wanted him to spit out the tea,
so he has to drink the whole thing, I think.
Was that not it?
No.
Steal his shoes.
Don't have to tell me to it.
Hi.
Oh, no, I didn't mean to do that.
I meant to steal your loafers, sir.
Sorry.
Yeah, I'm geeny, damn loafers.
Go sit down, sir.
Go sit down.
I want your shoes.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, he didn't like that.
Look at him.
He's taller.
Like, he's taller-y in us, but he's kind of not.
Uh, what?
No.
Oh, no, I missed my turn.
There, can't get enough, can you?
Sucker.
No, run.
Yeah.
Out of bounds.
That's right.
You aren't coded to come over here.
Only I'm coded to come over here, but you?
No.
Oh, did he just boot me because I took his shoe?
You don't deserve it.
Maybe use the big bell behind him.
Oh!
That makes perfect sense, actually, to do the bell when he goes for a sip.
Can we see him do a sip from that side?
One of us has to go on the other side, I think.
I think we, uh, I think we both have to do it or else we can, and...
We're back!
America Kayo, hello!
There he is.
Excuse me, madam.
I need the bell.
You're in my way, madam.
Madam, please refrain from getting in my way.
Right.
Oh, sorry.
Okay, that's definitely what you're supposed to do when he sips his tea.
We just need to hang around while he does his tea.
Okay, we're getting there.
We just need our handheld through the game.
Just a tiny bit.
Okay, just a tiny bit of hand-holding.
Right, so we need to wait until he's suspicious.
This is over.
He shouldn't.
He should drink his tea after he's done his, like, suspicious animation.
Oh, I'm trapped.
I'm trapped.
We're good.
I didn't...
This game is a lot harder than I thought.
I thought this was like a...
I say this about every game I play.
Oh, I thought this was a child's game.
Why is it hard?
Right, we're like, why is it hard?
Right, we're like, why is it hard?
Right, we're like, why is it hard?
Why is it...
No, the bell thing needs to be set up again.
She's not fixing it.
Oh, no.
You're right.
Oh, sugar.
What is she trying to fix right now?
She's currently painting.
I don't know.
I can take her painting brush.
Oh, I can draw her painting brush, one or the other.
Oh, wow.
Good night, Straniaga.
I'll wake up in four hours, bro.
You are going to be shattered.
Um, no.
Was I supposed to take the paper?
Oh, she's going to fix the bell.
Okay.
And then...
Do you want to put the duck in the other garden?
I wonder if that's what it is.
You put the statue in the other garden,
so then she forgets she even had a duck.
No.
No, no, no, no.
I must tell you...
Okay, there we go.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, it's now out of bounds,
so she can't ask for the duck anymore.
It doesn't work like that.
And now we wait for him to drink his dang tea
that must be frozen solids at this stage.
Because there's no way.
Please ask for tea.
Are you coming in this garden?
Yeah.
Your audio may be cutting out from me
on Discord a little bit.
Oh, sorry.
No, that was all good, the knee already.
So she knows it's fake, right?
She tells you to move.
Do I need to paint you?
So she's fixing that.
Wait, can I put the bull on you now
because we got rid of the statue?
No, I've done...
You didn't give me time.
Right, go paint.
Whoa!
Right, go paint.
Jeez.
Let's do this bail.
I want some bourbon.
This German.
Oh, he's about to do his animation.
Okay.
No, no, no, wait.
No!
He was supposed to do the drink tea animation.
Why?
Maybe this will help your mindset for the puzzle.
The game is meant to single player.
Everything can be done solo.
You mean we could be doing this twice as fast
but it's taken us three times as long?
Hold on a minute.
What's going on here?
These allegations.
Are you calling us dumb?
Why?
Because you're right.
Cush me.
Yeah, I mean, it's not.
Wait, water in this dish maybe?
I'm like trying to look around for hints,
but I'm like, bruv.
Stand on the stand when she's not looking.
Right, if Mercy's distracting her.
Okay, I've stood on the stand.
While she's not looking, I am doing no input.
As if that was it.
That took us so long to get the first thing.
Right, he's got tea in his hand.
I need to ring the bell.
Look at me.
I'm Mercy.
I have a bow.
Ready?
Yes!
Oh my God.
That's fantastic.
It took us so long to get one and now we have two.
Oh, now you have such a cool ribbon on you.
I know.
I have a bow like you now.
The soap.
What do we do with the soap?
Why do you have soap outside?
Well, she has like a bathtub and a toilet.
Quite literally is her decorative stuff.
Hold on.
Let me check where our objectives are
because I've completely forgotten that.
Oh, sorry, that's not objectives.
Make the man go barefoot and do the washing
with a bra, a pair of socks, slippers and a bar soap.
Right, hold on a minute.
Where would we do washing?
Right, I'm going to steal this guy's other loafer.
But where do we get water to do the washing?
Let's steal his shoe because that's super easy.
Hello, we would like to steal your shoe, please.
We do the washing in here.
No, it's not what it looks like.
We're not here for your other loafer at all, I promise.
I promise.
You can't get me.
Out of bounds.
Out of bounds.
Talk to the game devs because the face ain't listening.
Okay.
Oh, he won't let me in again.
Right, okay.
Well, go sit back down.
Because now we need to do laundry.
I don't really know where to do laundry.
Put the vase on the man's side of the garden.
The man will throw it back over.
Oh, we're just straight up getting spoiled.
Are you okay if we get our hand held?
Because I don't mind the wreaths and spoiling it for me.
Okay, we need to drag the purple statue all the way over.
We're back.
We can do it.
Don't mind me.
I'm strapped.
I'm not that fast, lady.
There you go.
I'm stuck on the fence.
Let me over.
Okay, we did it.
Yay.
Hello, would you like to throw this magnificent priceless vase over the fence by any chance?
Or vase vase?
I don't know.
Vase?
Like Vaseline?
He actually did.
Oh, he's going to go the other way.
Wait, why are you taking me?
He just stripped me naked.
Give me back.
I'm naked.
I feel so humiliated.
Oh, I guess we do the washing in here.
Oh, okay.
Because look, there's water.
Oh my God, we're swimming.
Wait, we need to grab the bar.
We need the bra and the sockies.
Can I quickly grab it this way?
Maybe I can run.
No, no.
Let's do it this way.
If she catches me, it's fine because at least you've got...
Wait, she's not even upset about the...
Okay, we're doing it.
We're doing it.
We're doing it.
We're doing it.
Turns out all we needed was someone to spell it out for us.
Wait, no, he's not going to throw that back over.
It's in the water now.
No, this is mine.
It's in the water.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do something.
Give me that.
It's going in the water for washes.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't want to stand in this.
No, these are mine.
There are many things.
No, go have your tea.
Why aren't you drinking tea a moment ago?
Go forget.
Forget?
No, no, no, no.
Hold on.
No.
Leave Mercy be, you fellow wench.
Harlan!
Yes, please listen to my problems.
Suzuki, life is so hard as a ghost.
You see, people don't...
Oh, well, you are.
As long as one of us picks up, that's the main thing.
Grab it.
I'm away.
I'm away.
I'm away.
I'm away.
I'm away.
I'll grab her stuff.
No, no, no, no.
Stop what it looks like.
I promise it's not.
Right, hold on.
There.
I know your neighbor's with that again.
Ah.
Take this sock.
Can you pick up that bar of soap?
That's on the bathtub?
Yeah.
And then we...
I think we're done.
I think we've done it.
Yeah.
Taking the clothes.
Right, as long as the guy doesn't take a random pair of socks off of us,
I don't know why he would care that much,
but I don't know where he is.
And the camera isn't zoomed out,
so I don't know if I'm going to run into him.
Is he still...
Oh, he's moved the bra out of the freaking thing.
Right, let me go get that bra.
Do not throw that bra over the fence.
Do you understand me?
Give me that bra.
Give me that bra to me.
I need that.
I need my training bra, okay?
We're doing laundry.
Is this what I'm supposed to do?
La, la, la, la, la.
Wait, this wasn't what I was supposed to do.
What is...
Do the washing.
A slipper!
Oh, no, I'll put all the slippers out of bounds.
Oh, no, I'm backfired.
My plan has backfired terrifically.
Hold on.
Hold the line, Mercy.
Hold the line.
I'm coming, Mercy.
Distract him.
No, no, no, no.
Oh, hold the line.
Hold the line.
Hold the line.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Oh, hold the line.
Oh, I'm running.
I'm running.
I'm running.
I'm running.
I'm running.
I'm running.
Oh!
Yes!
Yay!
We did it!
That was frickin' hard.
You didn't make it so hard.
God, that camera is so hard.
To-do list.
Make someone print...
The prize, right?
The prize.
I mean, it looks like he wants to do it.
I'm not really wanting to, like, make him do anything.
What is he writing?
Does that mean he just, like, honk when he's, you know...
Oh, he hit me.
Did he make a no-geese sign?
I think everyone's...
Yeah, literally everyone's doing a no-geese every time we're finished in an area.
Okay, do this.
Right, he can touch the brand stuff.
It doesn't matter.
How do we...
Is there any gardening equipment?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You just closed it on my face, lady.
Don't do that again.
That made myself clear.
Is there gardening tools in here?
Hello, lady.
Do you have a...
The shears?
Oh!
I see it.
And I'm messing it up terribly.
Oh, this is quite heavy.
I have to...
Hold on, lady.
Hold on, lady.
Give me that.
See this paint?
Man, I'm terrible at this game.
You know that.
Can you grab those clippers?
Yeah, I'm just gonna...
Excuse me.
Have you ever heard about our savior, Goose McGooseface?
Very good Goose.
One of the best Goose that lived for seven years, which is so big in Goose life.
It is...
Thank you for listening to my story.
Is that how you print a rose bush?
Well, we're giving them...
We...
Do we need to...
Oh, I need to move it.
Oh, yeah.
Huh?
That didn't do anything.
Do we need...
Is there a rose bush we need to, like, steal from her garden?
Grab the rose pot and drag it next to the shrub, then mess up the shrub.
Mess up the shrub.
Excuse me, lady.
You need to come back in your garden.
Man, fuck the shrub.
Fuck the shrub.
Fuck the shrub.
Fuck the shrub.
You know that Nicki Minaj song that's like, hi heels on Nicki?
Wait, wait, wait.
And it goes, fuck the club.
Fuck the...
Yeah, fuck the shrub.
Is that all?
I mean, I'm going for it.
Wait, he threw the things...
Wait, is she going to accidentally chop off the rose?
Yeah, looks like she is.
Uh...
She hid it behind her back.
Oh, no.
Do you know how long it takes to make roses?
It's like a very hard job to have them grow successfully.
It takes so long.
Right, okay, let's see.
We caused a...
We caused a problem.
Oh, no, he's...
Is he crying?
He said my rose.
He shits the rose, revenge.
Right, how do we get out of here?
Oh, what's she doing?
She's opening a panel.
She's letting us go out this panel here.
She said I had enough of you, geese.
Sorry, are we in the way?
Pardon me, lady.
I don't know what your plan is.
Oh, she got no geese as well.
Okay, I actually kind of like that when you're finished with this section,
the game's like no goose, by the way.
No geese.
Okay, okay, I'm out.
I'm out.
Jeez, I'm done.
Yay.
Okay, bye.
Thank you, lady.
What's in here?
Hello.
Oh, pardon...
Oh, sorry, I'm just here to bring...
Oh, we're just coming through.
Sorry, just visiting.
Oh, package.
Thank you.
Whose package is this?
Can we open it?
We can take it away with us.
We actually don't have an objective, so we're not there yet.
Is this the wrong way?
I like to steal people's mail.
I'm a porch pirate.
Look at me.
Yarg.
Yarg.
I'm going to post it in the wrong door on purpose.
I'm going to put this one on the other person's door.
Yeah, yeah.
And then they get to talk and then they'll fall in love or something.
Yeah, well, we're so good.
We're such good neighbors.
Okay, I literally...
We need geese everywhere.
Geese are actually secretly keepers.
You're so helpful.
We're writing fan fiction.
Look at the lavender.
Pretty flowers.
We love flowers in this house.
You're the prettiest flower I've ever seen.
Oh, it's juff.
I'm blushing.
Oh, the camera angle is swapping every two seconds.
Oh my God, there's a Benki!
AC is in this game!
Not this!
Look at the Benki!
It's for AC!
Oh my God, it's for Benki!
Wait, AC needs to play this game now just so she can walk around.
Look, you're so cute now.
Wait, how do I do AC's voice again?
On today, we're going to play Goose Game with Mercy.
Thank you, OGSans, for watching me and my kohai, Mercy and the snippets.
This is a terrible voice.
I cannot do AC at all.
I'm trying, okay?
I can't do AC.
AC is too unique and too cute.
Can't do it like a European accent?
Is it too hard to mimic European accents?
Of any kind.
Can you do French?
Did you learn French because you know,
I didn't really learn French.
Bonjour, salut.
Like that kind of French.
Oh, I've not heard your French voice!
I've not heard your French voice before!
Salut, merci, ça va?
Ça va bien.
Wow, your French voice is so cute!
To jouer avec moi, on...
Oh, we're at the meeting again!
Look, it's the rake!
Wait, are we done?
Did we finish already?
No, we couldn't have.
No, we've not.
Help the woman dress up the boss.
Oh no, did we...
Wait, no, but she let us go to the next area, so...
Are we finished?
Oh no!
Oh, it makes the ground keepers wear his own hat.
We don't have that.
But we're allowed to move on?
How do we make...
You accidentally went back to the beginning of the game.
Wait, so we need to go the other way to unlock the new map?
Hold on, Ray, let's try the other...
Only we would manage that, honestly.
Ray, let's try that again.
Let's try that again, Ray.
We'll go upstream this time.
It was the French, I'll burn the French this time.
I don't know where the fuck we is.
Wait, do we need to go along that bridge there?
No, maybe.
I'm swimming up the water.
To say water in French, you say...
L'eau.
Why is the French...
Why is water male in French?
I do not know.
No.
Can we eat?
No.
I'm skinny buying that skinny, you know what I'm saying?
You think where it matters.
Yeah, exactly.
That's what I like to hear.
Wait, so...
We're casually just flirting.
I remember seeing complaints like...
On feature group collabs, I was just turned into them being nice to each other.
What, you're surprised?
You're surprised that we're nice?
What do you want me mean?
Yeah, literally Scots?
What do you want me to be like?
Oh, you Canadians with your cube costs and all that,
and your fake French, like what?
Wait, so we weren't supposed to go here or...
I thought this was a nice area to go to.
What's the deal?
This was the way to go, because we opened a gate to get here,
and there was a new camera angle.
Oh, well, I guess we should move this way now.
Moving on up?
Maybe it was like a shortcut to go back, I guess?
A bit of Bologna.
Okay, well, considering...
Yeah, there's literally an arrow that's like...
You're actually meant to go this way, dumbass.
Oh, hey, a car.
Let's trap someone in it.
Oh.
So this is how Mercy lured her first victim.
This is how I heard my first victim, right, Senpai?
I put in, like, hot girls in your area in this truck,
and you just walked in.
I can't believe you guys actually responded to that ad.
She put up cute Yandere in your area,
seeking you now two miles away.
She's honing in on your current location.
Wait a minute.
Whatever objectives.
Get into the pub.
Break the dartboard.
Get the toy boat.
Can you say toy boat ten times?
Fast?
Toy boat?
Why?
Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
Wait, why does it sound like something's on there?
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Toy boat, hey, how do you say toy boat?
Toy boat.
Toy boat.
Toy boat.
Toy boat.
Toy boat, toy boat.
Bit of a toy boat moment.
Bit of a toy boat.
Like when you say, like, tin soldier or something,
and then you're supposed to say it like ten times fast or something.
Tin soldier? I've never heard tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier.
Oh, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier.
Okay, okay, I've not heard that one.
I heard like Peter Piper picked a pick.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you get his shoes? I want your shoes.
Oh, go for his laces.
Get him where it hurts.
Give me that.
Yeah.
We're terrorizing him.
Oh, I can't.
This camera angle is so unforgiven.
It really is.
No, I keep getting pushed away.
Do we need to jump in the van and scare them?
Jump in the box, maybe.
You're right.
There should be another box in the van.
Let's go into your secret kidnap van.
Wait, how do we...
We get in the...
How do I...
How do you...
Okay, wait.
Oh, no.
It's only one at a time, right?
You go in before me.
I'll be fine.
You go in without me.
It's okay. We'll cause trouble with leaders.
Yes, I think if you burst out of the box, maybe.
One of you hide in the box when the woman isn't looking,
close the box and wait until the delivery woman picks up the box,
she will carry you inside the pub.
What about me? I'll just stay outside.
I'm literally waiting in line for a queue.
I'm pretty sure people have to queue for nightclubs or something like that.
I'm queuing to get in the pub right now.
I've been to clubs a few times,
and I'm just like,
that's loud music.
It's not for me, mate.
Oh!
I got these Tism earphones
where you put in and it makes everything quieter when you go outside.
If you do not have them, they are so good.
I cannot recommend them enough.
I will literally send you a pair.
It makes going outside a heck of a lot easier.
Oh!
Yes.
Be careful. That's goods in there.
That's very valuable goods.
Do I make myself clear?
Do I make myself clear?
Okay.
There should be another box.
Am I going to...
Is the camera going to thingy out?
Oh no.
Can you see yourself?
I can't move. I'm stuck.
I'm stuck too.
Did the game devs...
Game devs? Hello game devs?
Any game devs?
Any hotpatch? Any game dev fixers?
That is not good.
I'm not sure.
I think we might have softlocked ourselves a little bit.
I'm not...
I'm stuck.
I'm stuck.
Game bro! Game bro!
I'm in! I'm in!
That wasn't very nice of me. Where are you?
I don't know.
Oh no!
Where's the grid?
Mild panic.
How on earth do I get to you?
There's a hole in here.
Yeah. What do you call me?
Oh where is it?
I'm reunited.
It feels so good.
Yunk yunk.
Yunk yunk.
Yunk yunk.
Okay let's destroy that dartboard.
Oh yeah! Actually we need to play...
Bullseye!
190!
Oh no no! We're just...
We're niceki's.
We're niceki's.
We're niceki's I promise.
We're not... Oh we have little...
Game...
All the toss the ring stuff.
Oh sorry. Were you playing that?
Oh sorry. Were you playing?
Yeah I think I...
Oh that's the dart!
That scream out on when he...
One, two, three!
Oh.
I'm sorry for distracting you, Gitzer.
How do we destroy that?
Oh no I'm sorry!
I get to play all harmonica!
Hmm.
Hmm.
How do we destroy a dartboard between us?
Maybe cigarette?
Maybe we've got something similar?
Maybe we've got something similar?
Hmm.
Yeah.
Oh! There's like a little podium!
I knight myself the geese of old...
Is it a podium?
Are they clapping for me?
Hello?
How do you open your wings?
I don't know.
Oh my god!
They love us!
Oh my god!
I was joking about this being a podium!
But we actually got a flower!
That's so cute!
Oh my god we're such good kids!
We should join a circus.
Yes we should join a circus.
What?
Oh that's so cute.
Okay maybe geese girl considered for Gen 2
because of how adorable these are.
I'm starting to warm up to anyone...
Suggestion to a wasp girl.
A what?
Oh see bug girls are an issue
and I'll tell you why I actually developed
mental, I don't mind telling you this.
Oh really?
Because of arachnophobia for example
or insectphobia is a very real thing.
It has a possibility
of putting the girl at a disadvantage.
Design wise.
Yeah!
If you didn't know
I don't mind sharing this with you.
But you know how you have...
Oh that's nice.
Oh that's it?
That's it no more?
Oh my god give them the flower!
You were amazing!
Oh I can't give them the flower
he doesn't like it.
You were amazing sir!
You wanna play again?
Mister?
No he just wants to look at us.
That's fine.
So you know how you have
two eyeballs?
Yeah.
I made sure
you had two eyeballs because
it's actually really startling
if a vtuber only has
one eye or is like a mono eye
monster girl type thing.
It's kind of one of the
rules of like
development is you can't
wait can she see me under the table?
You must have a girl
with two eyes that isn't too freaky
or you're putting them at a severe disadvantage.
It kind of goes the same
for vtubers that might have
multiple eye designs.
It's
unfortunately just like
a weird unwritten rule you're not supposed to do it.
What is going on over here?
Are we doing the dishes?
Oh it's the balls!
Oh it's the toy!
Ah! Hide under table!
Hide under table! Oh no there's no table over here!
Leave us alone!
Leave me alone I'm scared!
I'm just a little guy
who wants a knife!
Hold on I want this knife.
Hold on let me go on.
Oh wow she's like chasing me all the way out.
Chase me under the table good luck with that.
You look very menacing with
a knife in your mouth!
Oh the knife is underneath you I think.
What am I to do with a knife?
I don't know I felt like maybe we can destroy
the dartboard with the knife.
Break the dartboard get the toy boat
make the old man fall on his bottom
steal a pint glass
and drop it in a canal
and set the table knife fork plate
Oh.
Set what table?
I'm like proper stuck.
Oh what's this?
I'm currently getting gridlocked
mildly gridlocked.
Where are we supposed to set up a table?
I don't know.
Oh there's like a little underway pathway here.
I mean a bug girl doesn't need
multiple eyes.
It's kind of hard to like
Oh my god I'm like
Sorry Mercy's currently fighting
the owner and I'm like under here like
Well actually when it comes to the designs
and intricateness of having to produce
Emma. Oh no don't shim me I was saying.
You can't get me when I'm under
the dock.
Continue.
What table
are we supposed to set up?
Wait we're meant to make him fall
on his bottom. Oh when he goes
to play the harmonic we need to move
the chair out of the way.
Oh that's sad.
I don't know I know he seems a bit too old
for this.
Yeah he's literally already says oh my back hurts.
How do we break
a dart board truly?
Maybe we take a knife and then
he throws the knife instead.
Is this one supposed to do it?
No he notices as soon as
I take it.
Right so then what's the table we
can you pick up the dart?
You can.
Bunk.
Bunk.
I don't
I don't know.
I wanted to play too sir.
What the deal is
reeflings you're going to have to
hold my hand I don't know what we're
doing.
Oh no no no it's all good
it's all good.
Uh
this is Scalera
lens type thing.
So when he goes to play the harmonica
so basically we have to watch him play
darts and then he grabs the harmonica.
The table is in the back of the pub
where Mercy got stuck at.
We need to set a table whilst that person
chases us around.
That's severe.
Biblically accurate
Vita for Angel that's actually quite funny.
Yeah
well you you didn't get a bullseye
but that's okay.
Move out of the way.
I wasn't doing anything.
I wasn't doing anything.
Yeah yeah.
Oh
I feel so bad now.
Okay he actually recovered from
Oh no he didn't.
No we're sorry.
I wasn't really
at our attention but we got it done.
Right we need to set a table
up here.
I'm setting a table.
Table table table. What table?
Table. This table?
That table.
The table that
Mercy got stuck at.
This one? Why yes.
I am aware of a table Mercy got stuck
at. This one? Surely.
I don't
I don't see any.
The candlestick one.
I've been able to pick up the candlestick though.
You can't do that with this.
I don't
leave me alone. I'm just a little goose
in a human world.
Not there.
It is back lift.
Follow the path under the deck
to get to the back.
Wait
where Mercy got taken and I couldn't reach?
Oh
Oh my god.
Okay.
Let's get these items.
Let's get these items.
You're chasing me out.
Yes shoot shoot. We're out of the cafe.
Go away and go do
your cafe stuff.
Exactly. I'm going to grab some stuff.
I'm going to grab anything I can.
I got the cup for the table.
Are you going to grab something too?
Are you feeling risky?
Are you feeling risky?
I'm going to get chased out.
I broke it.
Oopsies.
Don't chase me out. I need to pick up an item
for the table.
That's right. I'm hiding under the table.
I'm off camera.
I'm out. Sorry.
It's fine. Pick up that candle.
You can pick up that candlestick I think.
I want to get the candlestick
but I'm stuck now.
I'm stuck as well.
This freaking video.
The distance thing.
Oh my god. I'm getting
pushed out by the guard as well.
Ring the guards.
This is the best I can do. Literally be right under you.
They did not make this game easy.
We're two players.
Sorry.
Stop chasing me.
How is he chasing you out like this?
We're literally
all the way inside the restaurant.
Did the old man
tell them?
No. Stop looking at me.
He is
honing in on you. Can you come under the deck?
I'm going to try to come under the deck.
No.
Okay. You're safe.
He should go away. Yeah. He said,
oh. Rassen for Rassen.
And he's going to go get a beer.
No.
He instantly locks on you.
How did he know?
That doesn't seem right.
That seems too difficult.
Follow the...
He's so persistent.
Poor man can't catch a break.
Wait. He's looking for his glass but I broke it.
Wait. There's now two people in the cafe area.
We need
so much stuff from it.
Hi.
Does he give up?
I hope he gives up. Damn.
Yeah. Is there anything we can do on this side?
I don't think so. I can see the goose sign
here. They're going to move it right here.
This sign right here. That's the no goose sign.
I can tell. I have gamer instinct.
There's a plate over here.
Wait. There's already a plate here?
There is.
Okay. We'll take that and then
we'll start getting it set up. Is there anything else
I can grab? What's this?
That's a bucket.
Wait.
I hope I don't break it.
No. I don't... Yeah.
Yeah.
It's so painy.
What?
Oh, my face.
My face! Ow!
My little goose neck just got
snapped in half. I can't believe he closed down
your face.
So red.
So what is...
We're like...
How do you describe the dart bird?
I am...
Right. I'm going to get the salt shaker.
Yeah. Get the salt shaker.
Give me this. Give me this.
Okay. I said give me this.
There we go. Right. And then I'll go on to the table
with you and then I'll go down the steps
and then I can put it on the little table thing.
And then that's one more. I am ticked off
of this. Yeah. Jeez. She is
feral for us right now.
I'm following. I'm following.
Is there emotion sickness levels
question mark? Oh, bad.
Because the camera keeps moving, but...
Okay. Do we need to pause?
We can always...
I'm very sad.
I think we've had a good game insertion.
We do not actually have to... Yeah, I don't want you
to actually be sick
by this game.
If it's too much, please don't be afraid to say no
because I can literally mean and chat
and ask questions and stuff.
I'm trying. I'm trying to
get through it.
Okay. How about we finish this
goofy level and then maybe call it
there because I don't want you to be sick.
Yeah. Is she going to be bothered?
Yeah. Okay. Well, great.
Right. Let's just check the list to make sure
we need to steal
a glass paint
and drop it in the canal. I don't even know
where that is. We just need a knife, a fork,
and a candle. Okay.
Don't worry. There's a candle there.
Okay.
Oh, she's right there again.
Oh, that camera angle.
She doesn't bother with us. Does she?
No, she's just happy.
She's like, what a curiosity.
You're breaking up my day.
Thank you, little geese for showing up.
I was like, oh, you're welcome. Right. Where is this
fork?
Sugar.
She's going to see me.
No, no, no, no, no. You don't see me.
I am a mystery.
Oh, metal bones.
No, no, don't push me that way.
Mercy's that way.
I'm getting pushed out.
I'm literally getting pushed out of the camera.
I can't bring you closer to the stairs.
That's okay.
I'm trying to grab the knife.
Game devs, you really
have done yourself with this one.
I think I'm getting shoved.
I know you're stuck.
I am complete. I can't even see myself.
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Here we go.
Wait, hold on.
I need to snipe his shoes, basically.
Okay.
This isn't...
Development team.
You need a hand?
Yes. Go, tie your lace
as it's dangerous to go.
Wait, I can't even get past?
Bro, you ain't even got...
The whole mechanic was that he...
You take your shoes off.
I'm being trolled so hard this game.
Hold on. Let me just move underneath.
No, never mind. I'm out of bounds now.
Yeah, it keeps...
I can't even get past. Okay, there we go.
Oh, we did it. We did it. We did it.
Go, go, go.
No, no, no, don't send me out again.
Don't send me out of bounds again.
Oh, it doesn't matter because he's chasing you.
No, I want my knife.
Well, one of us can...
I've taken the knife.
The knife.
Oh, no, no, he's got you.
Well, sorry, I'm running.
Pick up the knife, please.
Okay, there we go. I got it. I got it. I got the knife.
Run.
Run.
Okay, we did it.
My controls are not nice.
Help!
Help!
I can't even see you.
I can't even see me!
Wait, the guy doesn't respond
to honking at all?
He doesn't care!
No!
Oh, he sucks.
I don't like him.
Oh, no, I have made a grave error.
Go, I need to go underneath
or above either one.
No, I'm getting pushed out.
He's such a bully.
Oh, well, I can just sneak over.
Can you maybe run, please?
Nice lady.
I can't hear until he stops being aggressive on us.
He is like the worst.
Yeah, darn it.
He's not having any of it.
No, no, wait, he shouldn't know where it is.
I left it on the other side of the fence
at the table
that we set up so it should be fine.
Our knife is...
Yeah, go away, mister.
Go, go away, mister.
Literally, he's so aggressive against us.
This is discrimination.
I'll be talking to the BBC.
Exactly.
I'll be doing a report.
I'll be getting interviewers out here
so everyone can learn of your dastardly...
Right.
Hide under the table.
What's this?
What is it?
I don't know, but...
I'm pulling.
Oh my god, it's how I get a beer.
Wait, but I don't have a glass.
Sugar.
Well, I've got a fork.
We need to fork anyway.
Let me get out of here with this fork.
I don't know where the glass of beer is, though.
I'm underneath, so she can't get me.
I think we broke it.
We did.
So how on earth did we get...
Well, I did.
Um...
Ah, I knocked it over.
No, no, it's okay. I think it still counts.
As long as it's on the table, I think it counts.
Wow, I'm doing a little 360.
All right, it says...
A knife and a candle. We actually do have a knife.
Oh. Right, we just need a candle.
We've done this really awkward part.
Why won't it stand?
Okay, let's do this approach.
There we go.
Or do we have to, like, actually set it...
Like, the fork goes on the left.
The knife goes on the right type stuff.
Nah, they wouldn't put that in the game.
They wouldn't put that, right?
I feel like that's, like...
How do you know your knowledge?
Well, I cannot pick up the fork.
Is it glitched out?
It says the fork is there. Okay.
It still counts. We've got to get the candle now.
This is the candle.
And then we're done this terrible back and forth section, I think.
Where was the... Hello.
Hi. Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be in your way.
Wait, she's pushing me out of the way.
Stinky.
You want to give me all the attention, lady, don't you?
Yes, you do.
Where did she put the candle?
Is that the best paper again?
It may be.
I'm just a goose getting all the attention.
For no... Oh, I'm stuck on her.
For no particular...
I'll go under the deck.
Yes.
Oh, sugar. Okay.
You got it.
I don't know where she...
Oh, my game. My game just closed.
Whoa! However, I think you're going to have to come
down these stairs and then come underneath with me here.
If I don't get chased out, yes.
Yeah, come this way, this way.
No, no, no, no!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Send it, send it, send it!
Okay, okay, I think it's okay.
I think it's okay.
I've got the candlestick.
Oh, no.
That's the main thing. As long as we got the candlestick,
I can get you back in.
All you have to do is unpeel as we...
Yeah, you're not coming under here.
Oh, wait, why did I hit her?
Uh, you might be able to get past...
Yeah, you can get back in
if I distract him enough.
And then come under here with me.
No!
This guy sucks!
Oh!
It controls, it controls.
Okay, we're safe, we're safe.
The heat is now off of us.
Oh, you can see my little red flippers.
I like my little flip-flops.
Okay, he has gone back.
I think we can now go to the wee restaurant.
The wee restaurant.
I'm stuck on something.
We casually scroll in.
You're stuck?
I'm like getting stuck on stuff.
There we go.
I don't know.
Okay, there we go.
Wee!
We finally frickin' did it!
This one was not easy.
I think it's the control and the camera.
Yeah, this camera angle
is spinning around every two seconds.
Oh, I'm stuck again.
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
Is that vomit burp?
I'm getting nervous.
It was the motion sickness burp.
I'm so sorry, excuse me.
Actually, we can stop.
I didn't know when you just hop on our first collab.
Because we picked up this motion.
Okay, if that was a vomit burp,
I'm happy to say we have set the table.
Yeah, we set the table.
Okay, I am not going to make you play anymore.
I really do not.
Any issues?
Okay.
We will say thank you so so much
for letting us have
an absolute carry on.
Unfortunately, we thank you.
I stupendously
asked her to
play a motion sickness
and juicing game. I had no idea
that the camera angle was so violent
towards her, per mercy.
But I think
I'm happy to say we'll end it there.
I don't want any vomit.
Okay, that's the bottom line.
Okay, that's the bottom line.
No vomit please.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be sorry.
I was like, oh, it was so good.
I haven't burped yet on stream.
Oops.
We'll play it safe.
Please do not worry. Let's play nice and safe.
We will say to the snippets
and the reeflings. Thank you so so much
for watching.
I am streaming again tomorrow.
Merci. Are you streaming tomorrow?
Is the real question?
No, I place my day off.
Well, I'll put her to work
lads. Don't you worry.
I'll make an ASMR for her to put her to work.
Don't you worry about that.
Teasing. Teasing.
She'll have a break.
We will leave it there
and I'm going to let you know
that we're going to be playing
a motion sickness game.
We'll leave it there
and I'm going to let Merci lie down
because I think she needs a good nap
or maybe a big lie down
and some fizzy juice to help her feel a bit better.
But thank you so so much
for joining me, Merci. I appreciate that so much.
And that was actually genuinely really fun.
So much fun.
As chaotic as that game was,
that was actually hilarious that you
started controlling my goose.
Wow, yandere powers.
Literally.
That was supposed to be that most of this one here.
Right. Thank you so so much.
Thank you everyone.
I'm going to end a little strum.
Oh wait, no, no one's streaming
because you're the one that normally streams lads.
Should I?
Let's see if there's someone on you.
Let me check with one of the girls.
Let me check if I can find it.
Azura rated it in a U.S.
That means she finished her cheeky stream,
her cheeky bricky stream.
There are some girls
on. There's Rain
from Ume Plus
and a bunch of
VNU girls are on too.
I have not
I will do Rae from
Thingy because I don't think she's monetized yet.
She will watch Time.
Yeah, let's Rae into Rain.
I will Rae into Rae. She's doing
unicorn overload, number two,
shipping characters to fight better.
This one's like a
vanilla wear game.
It's supposed to be really good.
Have you played it before?
No, I haven't.
But I'm a fan of vanilla wear
games.
That's cute.
Thank you so much, Sneeflings.
Thank you so much, Mersey, for joining me.
Please do get some serious rest
because I do not want any.
How terrible is that headline?
Collab
results in like vomit.
What kind of collab is going on
if that's the case?
Thank you.
I missed some soupas.
Thank you so much.
Misaka best for the
420 blazes.
Stop goose hate. Thank you so much
for the tip you with me.
Thank you.
For the five dollar
super chat. Did you know Rick
Ashley is never going to give you up.
Never going to let you down.
Never going to let you down
twice. Never going to run around
and desert you. Yes, I knew that.
Thank you so much for the five.
Wow.
Thank you so much, everyone
for such a wonderful stream
and thank you.
It was unexpected that
we hit such a
dizzy game.
We got so close though,
but I would not have picked that game
had I known how spinny camera it was.
I thought it was
a straightforward linear
experience. So I do apologize for that
oversight, Mercy. It's okay.
Honestly, everything looked
like it was going to be fine, but like
yeah, that was
every time we entered or moved around
somewhere, the camera just like violently
spins over.
Sorry to anyone that also has
motion sickness watching. You probably feel like
right now.
Okay.
Right.
I will let you get going.
Thank you so much, Mercy.
Let's put it to the end stream
and then we're right into rain.
Yeah. Yes.
Okay, I'm end streamed. Bye bye, replays.
Bye bye.
In the broadcast.
Successfully.
