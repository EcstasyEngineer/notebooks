00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,280
from

00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:27,280

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,800

14
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,660
Haahaaa

15
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,320
Wait, how do I, how do I, uh, green screen it out?

16
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Alright.

17
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Ah, ah, ah!

18
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Should be muted?

25
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Shit.

26
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
There we go.

27
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Okay, hold on.

28
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
We were like, hardcore advertising.

29
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
We are gamersofts partners.

30
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
My dreams are coming true.

31
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Mercy's dreams are coming true.

32
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
We are so happy to be here.

33
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
We are so happy to be here.

34
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
We are now gamersofts partners.

35
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,320
So make sure you order, you order six times and use each of our codes.

36
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Yes, yes, indeed.

37
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,320
And if you order a lot, you might have your own flavor and waifu cup.

38
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

39
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Exciting.

40
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Don't you want to see a vealer cup?

41
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Hello?

42
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Be crazy.

43
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Oh my god.

44
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
I feel like life isn't real.

45
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Use all your membership money on gamersofts.

46
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I don't, I've never actually had like powdered energy drinks before.

47
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,320
So this will be my first time trying it.

48
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Same.

49
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm very excited.

50
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I've heard it's very tasty.

51
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,320
It is the ambrosia of all the VTubers and the gods.

52
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm excited.

53
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Game isn't allowed?

54
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I got, um...

55
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
They gave us a giant PR package.

56
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
We didn't expect how big it was going to be.

57
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
They're so nice.

58
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
We got three tubs.

59
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
And I'm going to eat them all.

60
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm trying to fix the game volume.

61
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
How do I get out?

62
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Would my flavor be?

63
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
I don't know.

64
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
I was looking for the flavors.

65
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,320
I want to buy silver veal flavor.

66
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Sorry, I was trying to get to the menu.

67
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
You're good, you're good.

68
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Take your time.

69
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Where's the menu?

70
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
How do I change the volume?

71
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
I think you, hold on.

72
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Um...

73
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Yeah, you have to disconnect.

74
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Seriously?

75
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,320
No, just go in your mixer settings, your sound settings,

76
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
and just turn the game down, the game volume down.

77
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,320
I don't know if I have game volume as a mixer thing.

78
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,320
It should be in the sound settings on the bottom of your window

79
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,320
and the right click on the sound.

80
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Sound mixer just lower the game itself.

81
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Kitty milk is already a flavor.

82
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Something about guac gamer fart.

83
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
That's one of the ones they sent us.

84
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
I don't think I actually have it.

85
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,320
I think I only have it as systems.

86
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Oh, okay, weird.

87
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Okay, then yeah, we can disconnect and you can invite me back.

88
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Give me a second.

89
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Let's disconnect.

90
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Give me the...

91
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I'm so...

92
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Me.

93
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Yeah, my audio is great.

94
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
My stuff is rubbing off.

95
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Oh, so me.

96
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
My audio is not that great.

97
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Shibby's fridge goes hard.

98
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Okay.

99
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Are you guys bullying my fridge right now?

100
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Should I host again or Shibby host?

101
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
You can host because I think the colors were better

102
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
because I was yellow and you were pink.

103
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,320
And I'm like close to that and you're close to that.

104
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
There we go.

105
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
You should be there.

106
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
I'll be there.

107
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

108
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Should we start up the first one again?

109
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Or...

110
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Call it number two.

111
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Well, yeah, because there's a...

112
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
We can show them our skills that we were practicing.

113
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Oh, yeah.

114
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Here's our first one.

115
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
We're very good, by the way.

116
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
We are gamers.

117
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Debating whether or not I should have us both on each side of the screen.

118
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Why are you just on top of me like that?

119
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Why are you humping my head?

120
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
I just wanted to.

121
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Okay, it's just one of those days.

122
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Oh, hi.

123
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
We just have to hump ahead.

124
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
It's just one of those days.

125
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
See?

126
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Teamwork makes a dream work.

127
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Oh, okay, hold on.

128
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
We did it, folks.

129
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
We did it.

130
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
Next level.

131
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Next level.

132
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
All right.

133
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
So, Mercy, there's a gap here.

134
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Okay.

135
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
We got to be extra careful.

136
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
You got that?

137
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Mind the gap.

138
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Fuck.

139
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Don't go backwards.

140
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
I'll catch you.

141
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Okay.

142
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
I'll catch you.

143
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Come here.

144
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Come here.

145
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Come here.

146
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Wait, I got you.

147
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Yeah.

148
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Ready?

149
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Teamwork.

150
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
You got to turn.

151
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
You got to turn with me.

152
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
There we go.

153
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Wait, don't go in there.

154
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Damn it.

155
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
It's just a scream of horror.

156
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
It's fine.

157
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm going to get the carrot.

158
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
I'm not going to get the carrot.

159
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Should we redo this level?

160
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Yeah.

161
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
You want to get the carrot?

162
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
I think it's past this portal.

163
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
All right.

164
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
You're in front.

165
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Don't kick me in the face.

166
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Okay.

167
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
How do we get out of here without dropping?

168
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
I...

169
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
I think...

170
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Hold on.

171
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Let me position myself.

172
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I think I can kick you across.

173
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Oh shit.

174
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Okay.

175
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Just a moment.

176
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Hold on.

177
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm almost there.

178
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm so close.

179
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Okay.

180
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
It's not going to work.

181
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
I need to flip.

182
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
It's fine.

183
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
It's fine.

184
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Nice.

185
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm getting into position.

186
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Yes.

187
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Get into position.

188
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Oh, damn it.

189
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
That didn't work.

190
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
This is how I move around.

191
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Did you want to do it again?

192
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
It's up to you.

193
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
We can try again.

194
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
All right.

195
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
What if we just launch ourselves?

196
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
What if we just launch ourselves?

197
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
I'm going to...

198
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
What's happening?

199
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Why are you planking?

200
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
I thought it was going to fall.

201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
All right.

202
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
What if I...

203
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
He's got a...

204
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
He's got a scooch.

205
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Nope.

206
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Nope.

207
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Nope.

208
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Sorry.

209
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm so sorry.

210
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I killed her.

211
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
I killed her.

212
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I'm so sorry.

213
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
I didn't mean to.

214
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Calm.

215
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm an acrobat.

216
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
As you say.

217
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Anything you say.

218
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
Yandere.

219
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Queen.

220
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
Oh, wait.

221
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Hold on.

222
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Let me just...

223
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Yeah.

224
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
It works.

225
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
All right.

226
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
I believe in you, Marcy.

227
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
No, I don't believe in you.

228
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
It's fine.

229
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
It's fine.

230
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Damn it.

231
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Next level.

232
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Sure.

233
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Next level.

234
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,320
It's only going to get harder from here, girly pop.

235
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
It's okay.

236
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
All right.

237
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
There's a little gap.

238
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
All right.

239
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I think...

240
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Don't kill yourself.

241
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Okay.

242
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Okay.

243
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
Can you...

244
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
How do I kick again?

245
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Damn it.

246
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
You got to jump over that.

247
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Nice.

248
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
You got this?

249
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
You got this?

250
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
You got this?

251
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
You got this?

252
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Oh, so carefully.

253
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
Do you remember how to grab?

254
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
The button.

255
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Yes.

256
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
You got it?

257
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Oh, yes, queen.

258
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Flip to victory.

259
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Oh.

260
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
You did it.

261
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Oh, my God.

262
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Why does it say we didn't get the carrot?

263
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
It said I got the carrot.

264
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Oh, I just don't count.

265
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Yes.

266
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Is it behind us?

267
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Sorry.

268
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Pardon me.

269
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Excuse me.

270
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
Pardon me.

271
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
It's not.

272
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
All right.

273
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
It's fine.

274
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Acrobatics.

275
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Acrobatics.

276
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Acrobatics.

277
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Why am I holding on to you?

278
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Because we need each other.

279
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Maybe you can jump like this.

280
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Who wants it?

281
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Mercy carry?

282
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
I don't think so.

283
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
No.

284
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
All right.

285
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
We can also help each other over the gaps.

286
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Hold on.

287
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
I'll be there shortly.

288
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
One moment.

289
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Check out the six-part core.

290
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Flip.

291
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
There we go.

292
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,320
See, now we're a little bit longer so we can flip over the gap.

293
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Oh.

294
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Yes.

295
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
You got to rotate.

296
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Oh.

297
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Perfect.

298
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
We are speed.

299
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
I got you.

300
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Don't worry.

301
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
We are speed.

302
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
We are...

303
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Wait, where's the carrot?

304
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
It's back there!

305
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
No, Mercy!

306
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Next level?

307
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Where she's like,

308
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
I'm not even going to bother going from the carrot.

309
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
What's backwards?

310
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
All right.

311
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I don't know.

312
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Why don't you find out?

313
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
You got it?

314
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Oh, hold on.

315
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
I need you.

316
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
You need...

317
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Oh, fuck.

318
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
She just took me.

319
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
I just got...

320
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
I just got kidnapped.

321
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Please do not throw me to my death, sister.

322
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Let's go.

323
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
All right.

324
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
I need to hold on to me

325
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
because I want to be able to cross this gap.

326
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
How do I do this?

327
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
It's a great question.

328
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Perfect.

329
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
All right.

330
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
We are wheel.

331
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
We are the first wheel invented.

332
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
No, stop!

333
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
We were not going to make that.

334
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Okay.

335
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
We have to jump over.

336
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
I believe in you.

337
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Mercy, you got to go first.

338
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
You're in front.

339
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
I got to be first.

340
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
You got...

341
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
No, you got to go.

342
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
Oh, god.

343
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
You got this.

344
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Yes.

345
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Yes, queen.

346
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
All right.

347
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
I'll be there in a moment.

348
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Let's go.

349
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Nice.

350
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
We're such gods at this.

351
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Wow.

352
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Oh, shit.

353
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
I'm actually...

354
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
I'm surprised at how well we're doing.

355
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Oh, oh.

356
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
Hold on.

357
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Don't die.

358
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Oh.

359
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Nice job.

360
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Impressive.

361
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
All right.

362
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Oh.

363
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Oh.

364
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
You got this.

365
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Oh, nice.

366
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Nice straight leg.

367
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Save.

368
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Do you want to get it this time?

369
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Here.

370
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Accidentally jump backwards.

371
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
So it's all yours.

372
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Try my best.

373
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Oh, no.

374
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
I had seltzer water and I need to burp.

375
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
I'm stuck.

376
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
I got you.

377
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Yeah, you can take it.

378
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
I'm sorry.

379
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
I took the carrot, not you.

380
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
It's okay.

381
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
I just got to get it out.

382
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
All right.

383
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Yeah.

384
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
I'm going backwards.

385
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Oh, what's happening?

386
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Oh, okay.

387
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
I'm fine.

388
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
I'm good.

389
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
No, mercy, please.

390
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Oh.

391
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Acquired.

392
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Wait, you dropped the carrot.

393
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
No, I didn't.

394
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Oh, never mind.

395
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
Oh, am I?

396
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Yeah.

397
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
Sometimes for this game, it's like,

398
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Lilly, NC is really weird.

399
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Sometimes you'll like fly off the screen

400
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
and then come back.

401
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Oh, I'm being taken with.

402
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Oh, no longer.

403
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Oh, I'm fine.

404
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
It's okay.

405
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
I'm good.

406
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
With the carrots up there, I think.

407
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
It's fine.

408
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Wait, where is the hole?

409
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Where is the hole?

410
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Okay, it's okay.

411
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Just a flesh wound.

412
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Just a little flesh wound.

413
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
It's fine.

414
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
I don't know.

415
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Oh, you just, it's your good.

416
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
This thing.

417
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
I just got your little toesies.

418
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
It's got a little toesies.

419
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
I'm gonna hold on to you.

420
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Oh, no.

421
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Oh, no.

422
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
You're my sister.

423
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm sister.

424
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
You're my favorite.

425
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I killed her.

426
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
I'm my sister.

427
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
I can't even call my sister.

428
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
I'm horrible.

429
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Jimmy, Jimmy, I trusted you.

430
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Wait, now I'm stuck.

431
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
I'm impaled.

432
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Wait, move.

433
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Are you not dead?

434
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Why are you here?

435
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Why are you putting dead?

436
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Wait, press the X button.

437
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Because it should have restarted by now

438
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
if you died.

439
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
All right, go back to the medial to restart this one.

440
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Let's pretend this never happened.

441
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Number seven?

442
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
Yeah, I think it was number seven.

443
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
The sun pies are raging.

444
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
I'm so sorry.

445
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Sun pies.

446
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Okay.

447
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
I scared myself.

448
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
All right.

449
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
You got this mercy.

450
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
You can jump across.

451
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
I believe in you.

452
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
I hit the tree.

453
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Yeah, the tree gets in the way a little bit.

454
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
You might have to lean forward.

455
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
You might have to like tilt like this in the jump.

456
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Hold on.

457
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
I've been a pickle.

458
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Nevermind.

459
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Avenge me.

460
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
It's fine.

461
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
I'm just going to swing.

462
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
No, mercy.

463
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
You can look at me.

464
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,320
I wasn't about to let you die, comrade.

465
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Well, thank you.

466
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
All right.

467
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Okay.

468
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
So it's fine.

469
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,320
I'm just going to rock with it.

470
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Yeah.

471
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Pro strats.

472
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Nice.

473
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
You almost got it.

474
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
She's making momentum.

475
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
It doesn't matter.

476
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
I'm probably going to die on this.

477
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
It's fine.

478
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
Let me just edge it closer.

479
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Oh my God.

480
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
I am a master.

481
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Hold on.

482
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
I'm going to throw this carrot down to you.

483
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
Okay.

484
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Where'd I fucking go?

485
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
There it is.

486
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Oh, we're going to go back for it.

487
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Okay.

488
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Yeah.

489
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
You can grab it.

490
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
If you can grab it.

491
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I grabbed you.

492
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
I can't.

493
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
I can't.

494
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
I can't.

495
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,320
I can't do this.

496
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,320
I'm trying to push it towards you.

497
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Okay.

498
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
I got it.

499
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
No, I grabbed the ground.

500
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Okay.

501
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Now I got it.

502
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Oh gosh.

503
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
My cat just jumped on my desk.

504
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Hold on.

505
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Pull me please.

506
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Oh gosh.

507
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
I couldn't see.

508
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
All right.

509
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Lead the way.

510
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
She's doing sit ups.

511
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
Come on.

512
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Don't show me the backup for you.

513
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Maybe just a little bit.

514
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
It's okay.

515
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
You got this.

516
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
You don't got this.

517
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
It's fine.

518
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
It's fine.

519
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,320
I can't even kill myself properly.

520
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Oh, there we go.

521
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
All you.

522
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm clapping.

523
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
It's like it's hurting you every flip.

524
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
All right.

525
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
It's fine.

526
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Oh wait.

527
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
I'll backup.

528
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Oh yeah.

529
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Nice form.

530
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Amazing.

531
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
I think I just started lightning outside my window.

532
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Holy crap.

533
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
That was bright.

534
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Yes.

535
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,320
We didn't get the carrot.

536
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,320
But we got each other.

537
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,320
It wasn't about the destination.

538
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
It was the journey.

539
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Oh wait.

540
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,320
It's a little bouncy thing.

541
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Can we bounce backwards?

542
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,320
We might have to bounce backwards on top of each other.

543
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Quick.

544
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Whoa.

545
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
That's hard.

546
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
It's good.

547
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
I don't know if we can.

548
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Can I like grab onto your leggies?

549
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Maybe.

550
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
And then we have like, you know.

551
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Extra jump before it.

552
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
I'm being smacked in the face by this thing.

553
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Oh.

554
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Okay.

555
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Whoa.

556
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I need your butt or your legs.

557
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I'm so, I'm trying so hard.

558
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Oh wait.

559
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
I got you.

560
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Oh hello.

561
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Whoa.

562
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
This is quite romantic to be honest.

563
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
I think we're both too heavy for this thing.

564
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
All right.

565
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Man.

566
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
That was romantic.

567
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
It was.

568
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
We just held each other and bounced around.

569
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
We could have kissed.

570
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
We really wanted.

571
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
We could.

572
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Kiss.

573
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Oh wait.

574
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
I didn't tweet with that.

575
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I was live.

576
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Did you tweet with that?

577
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
No.

578
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
I didn't.

579
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Okay.

580
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Let's tweet that.

581
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
We're live.

582
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,320
There's thunder and lightning outside my house right now.

583
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Are you going to be okay?

584
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
I hope so.

585
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Okay.

586
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
I can tweet that right now.

587
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
Oops.

588
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Been live for like 30 minutes already.

589
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
That's usually how it works for me.

590
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,320
I casually for gore.

591
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Live and hysterically laughing.

592
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I keep accidentally killing mercy.

593
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Oops.

594
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Get in here.

595
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Hold on.

596
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,320
I'm just going to quote retweet yours.

597
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Alrighty.

598
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
There we go.

599
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Where's my live button?

600
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Perfect.

601
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
She be a murderer?

602
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Hello.

603
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Is there nothing to see here?

604
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Sometimes my BDSM play gets a little bit too rough.

605
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:50,320
But you know, mercy is not, you know, unfamiliar with a little pain.

606
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
You got this mercy?

607
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
No.

608
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I'll back up.

609
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
Yes.

610
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
You got this.

611
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
I believe in you.

612
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
I believe in you so hard.

613
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I, I, okay.

614
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
It's fine.

615
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Your faith was gone.

616
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:13,320
Let me just, Romeo and Juliet impaled through my ass.

617
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,320
You're like, oh, you're done.

618
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,320
I got impaled with this bike up my ass.

619
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
All right.

620
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
We're doing good so far.

621
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Yeah.

622
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Oh.

623
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Well, I'm fine.

624
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
You're good.

625
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I wonder if you could throw the carrot across.

626
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Oh my God.

627
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
I'm so scared.

628
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,320
She's going to launch herself into the spikes.

629
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Hi.

630
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Mercy is durable indeed.

631
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Oh my gosh.

632
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,320
She is straddling that carrot.

633
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Try to grab the carrot.

634
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,320
I'll die with you, my queen.

635
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,320
When the gamer and the non-gamer play games.

636
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Please.

637
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Oh God.

638
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
I'm not a gamer.

639
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
What do you mean?

640
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Ask my, ask my, ask the harem.

641
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
That's the one who played.

642
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Oh.

643
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Oh.

644
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
All right.

645
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Pure.

646
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
It's my time to shine.

647
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Well, you grabbed it.

648
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
I will try my best.

649
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Yes.

650
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,320
When I try my best, I mean go backwards.

651
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
I mean, never mind.

652
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
It's fine.

653
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,320
I was going to see if I could jump back over, but it didn't really work out.

654
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
Well.

655
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Join me in the embrace of death.

656
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,320
Together our bodies and blood intertwined.

657
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320

1251
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:43,480
Go ahead.

1252
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,480
Whee.

1253
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:53,480
I'm stuck at the biggy go-all gums.

1254
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:58,480
It's your time to shine.

1255
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:07,480
Yep.

1256
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,480
It's okay, Marcy.

1257
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,480
It's okay.

1258
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,480
You did so good.

1259
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:18,480
You're doing a great job.

1260
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:23,480
I can't do it with this stupid spike.

1261
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,480
Do you want to end it here and just talk it yet?

1262
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,480
No.

1263
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,480
No, I'm gonna do it.

1264
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,480
Okay.

1265
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,480
All right.

1266
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,480
We're gonna do it.

1267
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:36,480
We're gonna do it, guys.

1268
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,480
Every time.

1269
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:42,480
This is what it's like when I play Elden Ring and I try to kill a boss over and over again.

1270
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:51,480
Marcy, when you finally make it, it feels so good.

1271
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,480
Well...

1272
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,480
Oh, come on.

1273
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,480
Did you fucking die on this spike?

1274
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,480
I did.

1275
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,480
Yeah.

1276
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:59,480
Well...

1277
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:00,480
Oh.

1278
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,480
Incredible.

1279
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,480
Yep.

1280
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:04,480
Then grab.

1281
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:07,480
Yep.

1282
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:11,480
She's getting the strats, boys.

1283
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,480
Okay.

1284
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:16,480
Just gonna...

1285
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:23,480
Slowly slides down onto the spike.

1286
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:24,480
Yeah.

1287
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,480
You make it over that gap.

1288
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,480
Perfect.

1289
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,480
All right.

1290
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,480
Let me see.

1291
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,480
I'll slide that one down.

1292
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:40,480
It's actually good if one of us is down here because then it makes the level a little bit bigger.

1293
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:50,480
Nice.

1294
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,480
She's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.

1295
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,480
That dismount, unheard of.

1296
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,480
And now watch me kill myself on these spikes.

1297
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:00,480
Actually, I'm gonna wait until you throw down the carrot.

1298
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,480
I'm gonna grab the carrot.

1299
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,480
If I can grab the carrot, give me the fucking carrot.

1300
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,480
It's very hard to grab the carrot for some reason on this one.

1301
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,480
Give me the fucking carrot.

1302
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:12,480
Nice.

1303
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:16,480
Yeah, you can just eat that to me.

1304
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,480
Yeah.

1305
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:19,480
We see.

1306
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:28,480
Hey, come here often.

1307
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,480
Yeah.

1308
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:35,480
This is where I die often.

1309
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:37,480
I just haven't been gamer enough.

1310
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:40,480
My gamer skills can't do this.

1311
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:44,480
See if you can get over the floor.

1312
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,480
Yeah.

1313
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:46,480
Oh, you want me to go before you?

1314
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,480
Yeah.

1315
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:49,480
Oh, well, you could have propelled me.

1316
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:50,480
Okay.

1317
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:51,480
All right.

1318
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,480
What if I just...

1319
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,480
Nope.

1320
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,480
Did you fucking die?

1321
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,480
Yes, I fucking died.

1322
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:59,480
See, it is not that...

1323
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,480
It's not just you, Mercy.

1324
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,480
I struggle with it, too.

1325
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,480
You're good.

1326
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:07,480
I'm so proud to know that you also have trouble.

1327
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:08,480
Yeah.

1328
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,480
It's hard.

1329
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,480
This game is difficult.

1330
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:11,480
It's supposed to be...

1331
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,480
What?

1332
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:16,480
See, you made it.

1333
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,480
She made the jump, guys.

1334
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,480
I made the jump when you died.

1335
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:23,480
Except I'm dead.

1336
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,480
Wait.

1337
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,480
Menu.

1338
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,480
Sorry.

1339
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:32,480
I made the jump when you died.

1340
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,480
Of course, that's the time I die.

1341
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,480
All right.

1342
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,480
Let's...

1343
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:40,480
I don't even care.

1344
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:45,480
Never mind.

1345
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,480
Oh.

1346
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,480
Sorry.

1347
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:48,480
You're good.

1348
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:49,480
Yeah.

1349
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,480
You're doing push-ups.

1350
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,480
I'm trying to figure out how to...

1351
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,480
That same position.

1352
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,480
Yeah, it's hard to angle it.

1353
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,480
Yeah.

1354
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,480
Lean forward.

1355
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,480
Yep.

1356
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:00,480
Son of a bitch.

1357
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,480
You made it!

1358
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:02,480
You made it!

1359
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,480
Okay, now I just don't have to fuck it up.

1360
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,480
All right.

1361
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:06,480
All right.

1362
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:07,480
Uh...

1363
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:08,480
Uh...

1364
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:09,480
Uh...

1365
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,480
Uh...

1366
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,480
Uh...

1367
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:12,480
Uh...

1368
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,480
Uh...

1369
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:14,480
Uh...

1370
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:15,480
Uh...

1371
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:16,480
Uh...

1372
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,480
Uh...

1373
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,480
Uh...

1374
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,480
Uh...

1375
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:20,480
Uh...

1376
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,480
Uh...

1377
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:22,480
Uh...

1378
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,480
Uh...

1379
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:24,480
Uh...

1380
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,480
I'm dead.

1381
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,480
You're dead!

1382
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,480
Ah!

1383
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,480
Ah!

1384
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,480
Ah!

1385
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:30,480
Ah!

1386
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,480
Ah!

1387
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,480
The spikes just got my head.

1388
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:39,480
The curse has passed on to another!

1389
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,480
One problem.

1390
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:42,480
Oh.

1391
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:43,480
All right.

1392
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:44,480
All right.

1393
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:45,480
Nice.

1394
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,480
All right.

1395
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,480
Oh, my...

1396
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:50,480
I almost just spiked my controller right there.

1397
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,480
Okay.

1398
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,480
Well, I'm joining you.

1399
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,480
Oh, damn.

1400
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:54,480
It's not for my wife.

1401
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:55,480
I turned on the light.

1402
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:56,480
Can't see it.

1403
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:57,480
Oh!

1404
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:58,480
Got it.

1405
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,480
We will pass this level, guys.

1406
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:01,480
Okay.

1407
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:02,480
Okay.

1408
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,480
Okay.

1409
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,480
Okay.

1410
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:05,480
Okay.

1411
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:06,480
Okay.

1412
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,480
Okay.

1413
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,480
Okay.

1414
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,480
Okay.

1415
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,480
Okay.

1416
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,480
Okay.

1417
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,480
Okay.

1418
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,480
We will pass this level, guys.

1419
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,480
Don't you worry.

1420
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:18,480
Oh.

1421
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:22,480
This little tickle, tickle your rear.

1422
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,480
Oh, yeah.

1423
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:26,480
Yeah.

1424
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,480
Oh, yeah.

1425
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,480
Okay.

1426
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,480
Fine.

1427
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,480
Yeah.

1428
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,480
All right.

1429
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:33,480
We got this.

1430
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:34,480
I'm...

1431
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:35,480
I'm pretty good.

1432
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,480
Okay.

1433
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,480
Okay.

1434
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:38,480
Okay.

1435
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,480
Okay.

1436
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,480
Okay.

1437
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,480
Okay.

1438
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:42,480
Is this...

1439
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:43,480
I'm pretty confident.

1440
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:44,480
All right.

1441
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,480
Let's...

1442
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,480
Ready to grab a carrot?

1443
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,480
Yeah.

1444
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:50,480
All right.

1445
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,480
Let me just...

1446
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:52,480
My little grabby paws.

1447
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:53,480
Sorry.

1448
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:58,480
I'm going to balance on it for a second apparently.

1449
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:03,480
This is hard to get the angle right with a carrot.

1450
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:04,480
Okay.

1451
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:07,040
This is hard to get the angle right with the carrot.

1452
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:14,720
Oh, all right. Yeah! Oh!

1453
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:21,680
All right, I'm gonna wait for you. I'm gonna eat my carrot while I wait.

1454
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,680
Delicious carrot.

1455
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,640
Oh, no.

1456
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:52,640
Fuck! Wait! No, you hit it! Oh my god. Oh my god.

1457
01:50:55,680 --> 01:51:00,480
Oh my god, folks. Folks, we did it. What the fuck? I can't get over this thing.

1458
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:06,560
Get the fuck out of the way, snowball. Are you serious? Is the snowball cucking us right now?

1459
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:08,160
What is this?

1460
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,320
Are you seeing this shit?

1461
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:18,400
Ain't no way this fucking thing's cucking us from my victory.

1462
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:22,880
All right. All right. Okay. All right. We're good. We're good. I was gonna say, I was gonna...

1463
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,920
Oh, mercy.

1464
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:43,760
Oh my god. I did it. I did it. Get the fuck out of the way. I did it.

1465
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,560
Do not kick me. Go first.

1466
01:51:49,360 --> 01:52:00,400
Oh, that was great. Oh, I'm proud of us.

1467
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:07,920
Oh, this is... See, now I feel so satisfied. Maybe you did that with the carrot, too. Look at us.

1468
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:17,760
Oh, uh, uh, uh, oh. Get in there. Get in there. Yeah.

1469
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:26,560
Oh, uh, oh, okay. Oh, this is gonna be difficult. Oh, fuck. All right. Uh,

1470
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,720
it might be hard. Wait, if we hold each other, you might be fine.

1471
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:37,360
Uh, yep. Perfect. All right. Now I can...

1472
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:48,240
Mercy! Mercy! I'm coming for you, babe.

1473
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,240
Oh, how did that happen?

1474
01:52:52,240 --> 01:53:05,360
How did that even happen? I glitched on my screen. Did I kick you or something?

1475
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:10,720
Yes, you did. Oh, on my screen, you weren't near me when I did that. I'm so sorry.

1476
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:17,840
Oh, no. You should be able to grab me.

1477
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:38,560
Oh my god, gorgeous. Let's knock that down.

1478
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:51,680
Amazing. What, where is that going? Oh, oh. Oh, nice.

1479
01:53:55,440 --> 01:54:00,400
I think I have to let you go now. Oh, is the carrot up here?

1480
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:08,720
Careful, bubble spikes over there. Oh, I'm not even, I'm not even gonna bother with that.

1481
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,600
No, thanks. I'm good. Nope.

1482
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:17,760
Can I? Oh, I thought I was gonna fly off.

1483
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:26,240
We did it, though. Yay! Look at us. Look at us. We're still kicking. We're still going. Oh, wait, hold on.

1484
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:37,120
All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Wait. This one, we have to hold on to it, okay? Okay.

1485
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:43,120
You ready? No, we have to hold on to it. Like, we have to, not on to me. I'm on to the block.

1486
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:52,640
Oh, okay. This is working out. Oh, that was fine. Nice. All right, Nifty. I don't know where we go

1487
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:56,880
next, though. I don't know if we go up or down. Maybe we have to jump up.

1488
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:10,080
Oh, God. Yes. Oh, no. Well, I think that was a ride.

1489
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:20,080
I think I knocked her ride away. Hold on to my legs. Let's go.

1490
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:33,440
Okay. So, we have to be on the ice block so that...

1491
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:42,560
Okay. Well, we know now it goes automatically. What is this game? It's called Super Bunny Man.

1492
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:48,800
You can play it with four people, Strawny, I think. Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll for your life.

1493
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,840
Go. We got it. We're good.

1494
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:02,240
Yes. Nice. Nice. That's fine.

1495
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:19,040
Yes. All right. Okay, do not...

1496
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:29,840
Yeah. All right. So, just land on that platform. Oh, shit. Like right here. Okay. I'm going to wait

1497
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:37,360
for you. Oh, no. Oh, no. You got to catch up to me. Where am I?

1498
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:46,400
What the hell? You survived? I don't know how I survived. I'm going to scout ahead. I'm going to scout.

1499
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:52,320
Okay. Actually, I think it's right here where the portal is. Yeah, that must be it.

1500
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:59,680
It's on Mercy's bunny ears. It was at the mercy of yours. Hold on. My bunny ears are right here,

1501
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:09,520
mother. All right. Let's flip onto this. Nice. Kneeling, holding hands. Fabulous. All right. Next one.

1502
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:13,280
Where's he? Hold on to me.

1503
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:27,440
Fabulous. Okay. I'll let you go first. Yes. Amazing. All right. Oh, hold on.

1504
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:38,000
I got it. All right. So, we just both got a... I stopped. All right. Let me flip over and grab your feet.

1505
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:44,960
And then, ready? You're going to hold on. Yeah. Hold on. Oh, we're holding on.

1506
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,200
Oh, my God. We made it. We did it.

1507
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:08,000
That was so fun. Oh, my God. Hey, Strawny. Want to see something funny? No. No. No. Don't you dare.

1508
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:16,160
I didn't even have to kick her off. She did it. She did the job herself.

1509
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:22,080
She panicked. Okay. I thought she was going to get me.

1510
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:34,160
Don't you fucking dare. Don't you fucking dare. You are. You are. Wait, I'll think again.

1511
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:48,240
Don't let go. Mercy. Mercy, please. Don't let go. Oh, God. I'm so kind to you. I know she has...

1512
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:50,320
Oh, uh...

1513
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:09,360
Scar, help me. Long live the king. I'm fine.

1514
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:21,040
Oh, hold on. Uh, oh. Where is this going? We're scouting? Okay. That's not that bad.

1515
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:24,480
I'm going to see how far I can get.

1516
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:34,160
I feel so cheated now. Oh.

1517
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:44,560
What the? Oh, the loop-de-loop. Oh, and the carrot's right there. Oh, I'm dead.

1518
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:46,960
All right. Now we know.

1519
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:02,880
Do not... You're good. You're fine. I trusted you. I knew you would catch up.

1520
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:07,280
Oh, sorry. Making us go backwards. See? I could have done that, too.

1521
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:23,040
Come on. Okay, it's working. I thought we were going to go backwards again.

1522
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:26,000
Nice. All right.

1523
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:33,600
What? I was just trying to get up.

1524
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,720
Who needs horsepower? What do you have, bunny power?

1525
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:48,880
Acrobatics. Acrobatics. All right. Grab my feet.

1526
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,120
Grab me. All right.

1527
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:05,840
I did it. Sabotage. Again, the game, it glitches, and sometimes I don't see when I kick mercy.

1528
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:09,600
Oh, it's fine.

1529
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:17,120
My cat is watching us play in great earnest.

1530
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,520
Nice. Nice. Holding on. Never mind.

1531
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:30,560
You like that?

1532
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:36,240
Go forth, mercy. Actually, yes. See how far you can get.

1533
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,040
What the fuck is happening?

1534
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:50,560
It's Reina. Reina is watching. You can hear my body being sliced up in the distance.

1535
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:58,720
Whoops. She's glitching so hard for me. She's just floating through the air.

1536
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:10,880
Take the loop, Dilu. Oh, my God. Look at her knees.

1537
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:20,000
Oh, nice. Okay. Then we can go backwards for the carrot, and then the portal is probably

1538
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:26,720
right there. Okay. Cool. Yeah. We got it. All right. We mapped out the area. We got this.

1539
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:33,200
Oh, shit.

1540
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:53,600
My screen looks so weird. I'm so scared. We're going to flip this over. Nice.

1541
02:02:53,680 --> 02:03:09,200
Oh. Oh, shit. I shall wait. Oh, my God. You are cheating death. Nice.

1542
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,960
All right. We should probably flip. Yeah. Perfect.

1543
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:22,240
And oh, I need to hold on. I need to hold on. We need to hold on. We need to hold on. We need to

1544
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:30,160
hold on. I'm holding on. I made it. Oh, I missed the carrot though.

1545
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:38,320
How many do we need? How many? Oh, we need one more. Okay. Okay. We should go back. We should

1546
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:43,040
need this one again. Oh, we said we have 24. What the hell? It shows me 23. Oh, man.

1547
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:49,280
All right. Let's do that one again and grab the carrot. That one seems kind of easy to get the

1548
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:58,640
carrot. Yeah. Kind of easy. We got this. Let's flip over that. Jump over that. Oh, shit.

1549
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:16,800
Oh, no. Mercy. What's happening? I'm so scared. We're going to fall off.

1550
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:25,360
Oh, no. My cat. Raina. Raina. Raina, please.

1551
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:29,920
No. Raina.

1552
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:38,160
Mercy, can you come grab me? Yeah. Never mind. Never mind. My fingers slipped because of my

1553
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:43,920
fucking cat. Raina just sabotaged me. I'm so upset.

1554
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:49,600
Can't sabotage. How often does Raina sabotage you?

1555
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:56,640
Very often or Boomi. Usually her and Boomi. I'm just going to do some pull-ups.

1556
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,080
Glad you could join me.

1557
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:10,560
Go back. Yes. Pro strats.

1558
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:14,560
Nice.

1559
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:20,000
Yoga pose and effect.

1560
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:28,560
Oh, I'm so scared. All right. Let me flip off. What is that?

1561
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:53,040
I wonder if we can actually take that and like... Can't we take it with us? Let me see.

1562
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:04,640
I'm not strong enough. I don't think I can. Why did it let me do that?

1563
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:09,600
Why was I so strong? You were so strong.

1564
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:15,760
No, I want to keep trying to take it. I can't.

1565
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:29,840
All right. Hey.

1566
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:37,360
Hold it on for dear life. Oh, no. I got it.

1567
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:41,360
I think we're going the wrong way.

1568
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,080
Like this.

1569
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,640
I need to rub my cheeks. Oh my god. My mouth hurts.

1570
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:09,280
A lot of pain. Oh, my mouth cheeks, people. Calm down.

1571
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:22,640
Oh my god. It's fun. It's fun. We're good. All right. I got my feet.

1572
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:29,120
I can't grab a thing. Okay. I got your feet now.

1573
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:34,240
We can just hang out like this. Wait. Can we flip it again? Let's see if we can.

1574
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:40,480
And... Oh, okay. Damn it. Let's do it that time. It's okay.

1575
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:43,440
Oh, mercy.

1576
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:54,640
All right. We can just flip together to this one and you can hold on.

1577
02:07:55,600 --> 02:08:00,160
And I'll just doggie style hold on as well. Oh, god.

1578
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:06,880
Okay. Are you serious? Are you serious? Are you serious?

1579
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:08,320
Oh, it's not fun.

1580
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:15,360
Okay. I guess we got to be balanced to like... Like in the middle?

1581
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,680
Like not in the middle, but I think like we both have to be holding on.

1582
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:22,400
I can't be holding on to you or you can't be holding on to me.

1583
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:27,520
I feel so cheated. Me too.

1584
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:35,360
It's fine. It's okay. It'll come back. It'll come back. Don't worry.

1585
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:38,720
It'll bounce back to us. No, it won't. Actually, I forgot. This is the one that does that.

1586
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:40,560
Hold on to me. Maybe it'll...

1587
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:50,160
No, I forgot. It goes down. So it won't come back up. Yeah. That was another one that did that.

1588
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:57,680
Taking a sip of my wa wa.

1589
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:05,760
Nice.

1590
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:21,440
Take it with us. Take it with us. Take it with us. All right. As I work it. Oh, fuck. Wait.

1591
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:27,040
Oh, please do not kick me. I'm trying to flip it back over.

1592
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,880
What? I wasn't even near you on my screen.

1593
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:37,920
What the hell? That was weird. My chat can tell you I was not even near you.

1594
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,040
Wait, I'm not dead. Okay, now I am.

1595
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:44,400
Okay.

1596
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,120
The physics are not... I need...

1597
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:49,600
Physicking.

1598
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:52,080
No. No.

1599
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:54,720
I'm holding on. I'm holding on. Yes. Okay. You got it.

1600
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:05,760
Oh, it's moving backwards.

1601
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:14,960
I'll push off. I'll push off. Yeah. Momentum.

1602
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:25,200
All right. Let me just flip. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect.

1603
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:28,480
Sorry. You're good.

1604
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:34,160
Dang it.

1605
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,080
Yes. Nice. Amazing.

1606
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:52,480
Okay. Wait. Hold on to me. Okay. All right. We're both on.

1607
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,280
Nice. Okay. Perfect.

1608
02:10:55,520 --> 02:11:02,640
Wait. I got it. We made the loop. Get ready to let go.

1609
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:11,840
Yes. You got it. Grab the carrot. I'm going to grab it. I'm grabbing it slowly, but surely.

1610
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:15,840
Oh, hello, Raiders. Who raided? Sorry. I totally didn't see.

1611
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:20,000
Oh, welcome, Kendra. Thank you for the raid. Welcome. Welcome, Raiders.

1612
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:34,560
Oh, wait. Is this the next level? This is the next level. Okay.

1613
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:38,240
I'll wait for you.

1614
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:48,960
I'm so happy you can grip ice. Oh my god.

1615
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:54,720
Good luck to the both of us trying to jump up here. How is that going to work?

1616
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:58,400
Oh, wait. I know. I'm going to hold here and then you can push off me.

1617
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,600
There we go. You got this. Yeah.

1618
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,360
Let's grab onto the ice.

1619
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:07,200
It's not working.

1620
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:16,080
Oh, I managed to finally get up. I died though.

1621
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:20,240
Yeah, I saw. All right. Let me see what we're at.

1622
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:27,680
All right. There's a little blood bounce too. Can I? Oh my god.

1623
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:35,360
I wanted to go see what was in it. Totally 100% this game. I don't know if we could.

1624
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:42,080
Oh, wait. What's wrong? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What's happening?

1625
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:45,600
Thank you, kind one.

1626
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:50,960
Okay.

1627
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:03,440
Oh, I just slowly slide off screen. Okay. This is we're going to need to

1628
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,880
highlight some of this stream.

1629
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:09,760
All right.

1630
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:16,640
All right. This is so hard not to die on from these spikes.

1631
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:23,360
On my butt. Wait, you died?

1632
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:28,640
Now I did. I wasn't dead and now I am. Take me with you.

1633
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:45,360
Nice. Oh, god.

1634
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:57,120
Yes. Oh, okay. Now I think I want to go the other way for this.

1635
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:13,520
Oh, are you kidding me, bro? Bro. Hold on. Let me see. Let me scout ahead. Yes, scout scout.

1636
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:22,240
Nice. Okay. Okay. So that means we can knock that down.

1637
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:32,320
Cool. Oh, god. How are we supposed to? Okay. You'll probably have to go backwards.

1638
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:34,160
Yeah. And then you have to really kick off.

1639
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:40,560
Nice. Okay. And the thing is probably right there. Yeah. It's probably right there. Okay.

1640
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:49,920
All right. Somehow is this you and that one? Yeah. Thank you. No, thank you again.

1641
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:57,280
Slow my speed down.

1642
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:11,040
I'm so scared. Mercy. Mercy. I don't want to die. Mercy.

1643
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:15,440
Just do a little task.

1644
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:18,960
Never mind.

1645
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:31,520
And I'm stuck. Oh, my. Give me a second. As I also try to die. I'm throwing around.

1646
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:38,880
Fuck. How did you survive that? How did I survive that? I think this might be the level for me that

1647
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:45,040
I won't be able to pass. Don't forget to hit that like and subscribe button, kids. Don't forget

1648
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:50,000
to hit the like and subscribe. It really helps out the channel. And don't forget, I make new videos

1649
02:15:50,000 --> 02:16:01,120
every week. And buy G Fuel with our codes, Mercy and Sheebie to get 10% off. I mean, game or something.

1650
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:17,200
All right, you fucked it up. Cut it out. Cut the cameras. Cut the cameras, everyone. What's a timestamp?

1651
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:26,320
Fuck. I'm ending stream right now.

1652
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,280
GamerSops.

1653
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:39,920
It's GamerSops. We hate that G Fuel, shit.

1654
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:41,920
GamerSops.

1655
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:57,680
Use code, Sheebie and GamerSops and Mercy. We hate the other competitors. We don't even know them.

1656
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:00,800
But I don't even know them. Who is, who are they? Who is she?

1657
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:01,680
Help.

1658
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:14,640
Hey guys, I'm feeling really sluggish and tired today. Anyone know a good way to increase my energy

1659
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:20,160
without drinking those insanely sugary energy drinks? Oh my gosh, do I have the product for you,

1660
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:27,040
Harlet? I highly recommend GamerSops. They have the most amazing flavors and such unique names

1661
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:34,400
and cool shaker cups. Nothing like anything else on the market. Use code, Sheebie and Mercy for 10%

1662
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:42,800
off and you can be amazing today and be a real gamer. What's up?

1663
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:50,240
I'm gonna go kill myself in this game, of course.

1664
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:56,560
It's so funny because Mercy said the wrong thing earlier and I corrected her

1665
02:17:56,560 --> 02:18:00,880
and now she's doing it to me. This is before stream started though.

1666
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,720
I mixed them up because they...

1667
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:11,600
It's okay, we both, it's okay. It's okay, don't worry about it.

1668
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:25,440
Oh. Oh, okay. We made it. With the power of GamerSops, we made it. We love GamerSops.

1669
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:32,080
Stan GamerSops, everyone. Strani's gonna fucking beat my ass after the stream. I'm so scared.

1670
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:35,520
I think I'm also dead.

1671
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:41,680
What the fuck? Well, goodbye.

1672
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:45,920
Let me die.

1673
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:53,040
I can't wait to edit the Vod. I'll edit the Vod too, don't worry.

1674
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:55,280
Is that 215?

1675
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:00,000
We are never...

1676
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:03,600
Hey, listen. I'm new to this sort of...

1677
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:10,480
Everybody's cracking up right now.

1678
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:19,520
Made it alive. Wait, did you die?

1679
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:27,760
No, don't summon the Clippers.

1680
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:32,000
You so died. Give me a second.

1681
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,800
I didn't die. I don't know what you're talking about.

1682
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:39,280
I think I just heard my body hit the spring.

1683
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:46,400
Strani, I'm sorry. Please don't hurt me.

1684
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:49,840
I love you, mommy. Mom, please.

1685
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:53,600
Thank you.

1686
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:58,720
I fucking think I forgot his layer.

1687
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:08,800
I made my GamerSops thing so big.

1688
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:14,080
Oh, we made it.

1689
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:18,160
Okay. Jump over?

1690
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:19,920
I can't move.

1691
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:21,760
What do you mean you can't move?

1692
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:24,720
Okay, I fixed it. It's because I clicked off the screen.

1693
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:31,440
Okay.

1694
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:34,880
Oh, hello.

1695
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:38,880
Go that way. You silly goose.

1696
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:41,440
Look at us.

1697
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:42,640
Nope. Come back.

1698
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,480
I'm trying to come back.

1699
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:47,680
Wait.

1700
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:54,080
Oh, no, no, no, Marcy.

1701
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:58,480
Senpai.

1702
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:02,960
Where is it?

1703
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:08,640
Wait, what is happening?

1704
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:09,120
Let go.

1705
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:16,240
She's so strong.

1706
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:18,880
What the fuck just happened?

1707
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:20,160
Can we move this guy over?

1708
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,960
We switched places.

1709
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:25,520
That was so weird.

1710
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:30,080
Okay. Let me just, I need to like flip.

1711
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:35,360
Yes. Oh my god.

1712
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:38,080
You see those? I'm fucking, call me messy.

1713
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:39,040
I'm a footballer.

1714
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:44,160
Yes. Yes. Stuck there.

1715
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:44,400
Cool.

1716
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:46,400
In an order

1717
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:49,680
to win.

1718
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:50,320
Win for you.

1719
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:51,760
I'm waiting for you to go.

1720
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:54,080
Well, I'm waiting to go back because

1721
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:54,560
Oh, okay.

1722
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:56,880
You need to kick off of this fucking ball.

1723
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:02,640
Nice. Okay.

1724
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:03,280
Then we make it.

1725
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:04,080
My turn.

1726
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:06,720
Nope. I'm going too fast.

1727
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:09,760
Go back to the ball and kick off of it.

1728
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:14,080
Falco kick.

1729
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,280
I'm killing myself.

1730
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:40,480
I hate this game.

1731
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:57,280
I'm so

1732
02:23:08,320 --> 02:23:10,080
I can't do this right now.

1733
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:21,760
I keep forgetting my gamer sucks is there.

1734
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,280
I didn't fucking up.

1735
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:28,240
Never mind. I died.

1736
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,840
I'm a giggling mess.

1737
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:37,840
I can't do this.

1738
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:42,240
Oh my god.

1739
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:45,040
I'm sending an apology right in the letter right now.

1740
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:46,240
She be fix it.

1741
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:51,520
I can't fix it because I can't see it.

1742
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:54,080
There it is.

1743
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:55,040
Let me grab it.

1744
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:56,960
No, that's the game.

1745
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:00,640
I can't grab it.

1746
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:07,840
I can't grab it.

1747
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:24,800
It's still too big.

1748
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:26,800
It's still fucking huge.

1749
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:31,280
I'm putting it in the corner.

1750
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:36,880
No.

1751
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:46,720
Okay.

1752
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,960
I think once we beat this one,

1753
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:51,680
I got to get off because I'm losing my mind.

1754
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:56,560
I have never laughed this hard in my life.

1755
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:58,480
I'm getting a migraine.

1756
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:03,440
Why is I can't?

1757
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:05,360
Oh, okay. Thank you.

1758
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:10,240
What am I doing?

1759
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:19,760
Actually, that was helpful.

1760
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:21,840
I died in the process.

1761
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:31,440
Did you just fucking reappear?

1762
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:33,360
What do you mean?

1763
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:37,280
Oh, look at me.

1764
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:39,360
Look at this.

1765
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:40,800
Oh, oh, skill.

1766
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:53,200
Oh my god.

1767
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:55,040
Imagine if we were drunk doing this.

1768
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:56,560
This is a sober, guys.

1769
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:58,080
This is a sober.

1770
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:00,080
Imagine us on gamer subs.

1771
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:04,560
Energized with amazing, wholesome energy

1772
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:06,080
with our amazing flavors

1773
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:08,640
and that you can get with temperatures set off.

1774
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:14,080
I can't get up.

1775
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:15,600
Help.

1776
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:17,440
I'm falling and I can't get on.

1777
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:17,760
I'm good.

1778
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:23,040
Oh, shit.

1779
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:37,280
I can't even see.

1780
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:38,560
I'm crying.

1781
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,960
I can't even see through my tears.

1782
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:42,160
I can't even talk.

1783
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:52,400
No, don't mix gamer subs with alcohol, please.

1784
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:53,760
That is, don't do that.

1785
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:07,120
Someday I'll get there.

1786
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:12,240
Don't just, just you wait.

1787
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:13,840
Just you wait.

1788
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:16,400
When I get my cotton bud over there,

1789
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:19,520
you're going to rue the day.

1790
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:22,000
Spike.

1791
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:24,320
Just you wait, Spike.

1792
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:25,520
Just grab the ice.

1793
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:29,200
Grab.

1794
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:29,760
There you go.

1795
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:33,360
Now don't move too much.

1796
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:36,880
There you go.

1797
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:37,360
Oh my god.

1798
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,120
Okay.

1799
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:40,160
Oh gosh.

1800
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:42,800
Now just make it over this jump.

1801
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:49,120
And then first.

1802
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:56,880
Kick over there.

1803
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:58,640
You got it.

1804
02:27:58,640 --> 02:27:59,600
Who the fuck is the carrot?

1805
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:01,840
I have no idea where the carrot is.

1806
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:14,320
Oh god.

1807
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:15,600
Just wait for you to go back.

1808
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:16,080
There you go.

1809
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:27,680
Oh my god.

1810
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:31,040
Okay.

1811
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:31,520
I'm done.

1812
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:31,840
I can't.

1813
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,120
I can't.

1814
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:33,520
Okay.

1815
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:36,480
Would you like to go to just chatting stream?

1816
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:36,880
Yeah.

1817
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:40,160
Would you like to talk alone with your chat?

1818
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:47,280
I can't talk at all.

1819
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:51,840
So I'm crying.

1820
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:52,960
It's okay.

1821
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:00,080
Oh my god.

1822
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:02,080
I'm sad.

1823
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:03,360
It's okay.

1824
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:05,520
I'm so sorry.

1825
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:10,240
I'm laughing.

1826
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:11,440
I'm like sad crying.

1827
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:12,800
I'm laughing crying, I swear.

1828
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:18,640
It's okay.

1829
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:19,840
You can take your time.

1830
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:20,480
It's okay.

1831
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:21,520
We can talk later.

1832
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:23,760
I love you, Mercy.

1833
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:24,480
I love you too.

1834
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:26,000
I'll see you.

1835
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:30,560
Thank you for playing with me.

1836
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:34,320
That was the most fun I've had in a long time.

1837
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:36,640
Thank you.

1838
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:40,160
Everybody say bye to Kohai.

1839
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:42,640
Bye bye.

1840
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,640
Shh.

1841
02:29:58,160 --> 02:29:58,800
It's okay.

1842
02:29:58,800 --> 02:29:59,360
It's okay.

1843
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:00,560
Breathe.

1844
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:01,680
Breathe.

1845
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,960
I say that not breathing myself.

1846
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:11,040
What the fuck was that?

1847
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,200
What do you mean what the fuck was that?

1848
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:14,000
Give me a second.

1849
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,520
I'm still in the stream.

1850
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:17,840
Did you hear that?

1851
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:18,160
No.

1852
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:24,720
I just heard a wah wah wah wah.

1853
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:27,360
I did not hear that.

1854
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,360
Who the fuck?

1855
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:33,440
There's nobody else in the chat with us.

1856
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:34,560
What just happened?

1857
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:36,560
What the hell?

1858
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,200
I'm losing it.

1859
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:40,240
Am I losing it?

1860
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:41,280
Okay.

1861
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,040
I'm not going crazy.

1862
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:44,320
Okay.

1863
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:51,440
Oh my god.

1864
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:52,000
It's okay.

1865
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:55,920
I'll move to the just chatting.

1866
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:58,080
I don't think you appear in just chatting for me.

1867
02:30:58,080 --> 02:30:58,320
So.

1868
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:00,160
I love you.

1869
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:02,960
I love you, Mercy.

1870
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:03,360
I love you too.

1871
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:04,240
I want to go.

1872
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:06,480
Let's let's I'll get out of the the call.

1873
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:08,960
Bye.

1874
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:09,600
Bye.

1875
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:17,520
I gotta get rid of her too.

1876
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:21,920
Hold on.

1877
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:22,720
She's still here.

1878
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:25,600
She's still here.

1879
02:31:26,480 --> 02:31:26,560
Okay.

1880
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:27,040
There we go.

1881
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:39,440
I uh.

1882
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:47,280
I ask very kindly that that please understand.

1883
02:31:47,360 --> 02:31:52,080
That we are brain empty.

1884
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,360
Are you guys okay?

1885
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:15,600
That was hard.

1886
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:18,560
She just just laughed her head off so much.

1887
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:18,800
Okay.

1888
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:19,200
Hold on.

1889
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,240
Let me move my ears.

1890
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:22,720
My my totally real ears.

1891
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:30,000
That was so funny.

1892
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,360
But I'm also just like, oh my gosh, we are so.

1893
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:37,120
We are both on.

1894
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:40,720
He killed me so many times.

1895
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:41,920
That's just love.

1896
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:44,480
That's just love everyone.

1897
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:45,920
Everyone knows that love.

1898
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:48,480
Sometimes you got to kill each other a few times.

1899
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:03,120
Sometimes love has happy little accidents and those accidents

1900
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:09,040
are can run into spikes and off edges.

1901
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:09,360
Yeah.

1902
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:13,040
I hope you guys had a very good time with us.

1903
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:16,640
I am also very sorry this week.

1904
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:20,240
Was um.

1905
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:26,080
I made the mistake.

1906
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:27,440
I made the mistake.

1907
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:28,000
Oh my god.

1908
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,120
Let me look at my schedule.

1909
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:32,560
And um I.

1910
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:42,560
I uh made my regular streams one hour earlier than usual.

1911
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:50,720
So please keep that in mind that instead of the regular 11pm EDT it will be um.

1912
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:53,360
It will be.

1913
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:00,000
10pm EDT.

1914
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:00,960
That was my mistake.

1915
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,080
I put it in the wrong time.

1916
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:02,800
I'm going to see.

1917
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:04,080
I'm going to do it for a little bit.

1918
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:04,240
See.

1919
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:08,320
Uh try that schedule for a little bit.

1920
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:14,560
So we'll see how it goes.

1921
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:24,160
Um and if it doesn't go well I will probably change back.

1922
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:26,080
Yes.

1923
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:29,280
But we'll see.

1924
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:29,680
Okay.

1925
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:33,040
Sorry I did not read out supers.

1926
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:34,880
So I'll read supers right now.

1927
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:36,960
Thank you for the new new members.

Everyone who joined for membership.

1929
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:40,160
Thank you for the 199 super chat.

1930
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:50,160
xvintitro did a sm64 blg.

1931
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:56,000
Is that Super Mario 64 the back jump?

1932
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:56,720
The jump?

1933
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:57,680
The staircase jump?

1934
02:34:59,120 --> 02:34:59,520
Yes.

1935
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:00,720
The backwards long jump.

1936
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:01,120
Yes.

1937
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:01,440
Yes.

1938
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:01,760
Yes.

1939
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:02,000
Okay.

1940
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:04,320
Yes.

1941
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:04,560
Yes.

1942
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:05,280
I know this.

1943
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:05,920
I know this stuff.

1944
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:10,480
I am familiar with the gamer world.

1945
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:23,040
I'm familiar with the gamer world.

1946
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:31,520
Not a good gamer but familiar with the gamer world.

1947
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:36,080
But yes speed some of this game is so funny.

1948
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:37,600
There's some speedrun strats.

1949
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:54,240
Speedrun strats that I'm familiar with but not I cannot do myself so I am familiar with them.

1950
02:35:56,640 --> 02:36:02,880
Um but this game's definitely got a lot of glitches that just shoots you across

1951
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:05,040
the screen sometimes that's really funny.

1952
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:23,200
xvintitro did a sm64 blg.

1953
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:24,480
That was really funny.

1954
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:32,800
It's so funny.

1955
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,000
Some of it was so funny.

1956
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:35,760
I'm like in tears.

1957
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:41,360
I've got like a little bit of tear coming out of one eye.

1958
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:45,440
But that was really funny.

1959
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:53,040
If you have friends I think you can play up to a series of four friends for Super Bunny Man.

1960
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:58,080
And if you have like some friends you can play with it'll be fun.

1961
02:36:58,960 --> 02:37:00,960
Yeah.

1962
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:06,160
You're so bad.

1963
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:07,360
That was so funny.

1964
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:13,280
Especially the last one where she'd be so out.

1965
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:17,280
Flies over the portal.

1966
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:18,400
The portal is.

1967
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:23,760
She flies over the portal.

1968
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:26,800
How did my hand just turn over?

1969
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:37,120
That was good.

1970
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,680
Yeah okay so some of this some of parts of the screen will be cut for a little bit for

1971
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,480
obvious reasons.

1972
02:37:53,760 --> 02:38:05,360
Please forgive that and forgetty beam it.

1973
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:05,840

02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:47,440
I don't know.

1989
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:55,840
My favorite flavors are usually oh my goodness my tracking is now is now losing itself.

1990
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:08,080
Um my favorite flavors are usually like sweeter flavors like strawberry milk

1991
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:12,160
like strawberry milk or um

1992
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:16,720

02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,120
something sweet you know

1994
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:27,680
I like sweet stuff so it'll probably be something

1995
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:33,360
sweet I like strawberry milk yeah I love the strawberry milk flavor.

1996
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:42,000
It'll probably be something like tempai's blood or something.

1997
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:45,040
I'm not very creative

1998
02:40:49,760 --> 02:41:00,880
or if we're going buy buy um buy like

1999
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:05,440

oh

2002
02:41:29,840 --> 02:41:34,480
nectar is always used so much in visual novels

2003
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:47,200
so that's why I'm always like nectar get all nectar

2004
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:49,200

2005
02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:51,520

2006
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:57,440
yandere nectar

2007
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:06,560
I would love um I would I know that they already have a strawberry flavor so I'll think of

2008
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:13,440
something like maybe strawberry milk or maybe it'll be like uh

2009
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:17,040
like a um

2010
02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:28,400
what do you call it or maybe a floral flavor yeah like lavender like like lavender or rose

2011
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:37,840
maybe like rose is pistachio I don't know if that's gonna be popular though

2012
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:39,440
hahaha

2013
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:44,640
I don't know if that'll be like popular

2014
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:53,920
pistachio's needle but I'm not sure if it'd be like great as a drink

2015
02:43:00,160 --> 02:43:02,800
strawberry banana I don't think I would like strawberry and banana

2016
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:06,480
maybe like strawberry and roses or

2017
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:13,760
or uh jam jam and lavender

2018
02:43:21,360 --> 02:43:27,360
strawberry and roses you sounds hella unique though have you ever had a strawberry and rose like um

2019
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:37,360
um ice cream they're pretty good they're pretty good I'm usually I really like floral flavors or

2020
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:45,440
like sweet flavors usually the sweet flavors are um are

2021
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:51,440
are like

2022
02:43:53,520 --> 02:44:00,320
kind of mild my favorite flavors are really mild I also like mint but I feel like mint will be too

2023
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:03,040
too um

2024
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:06,080
you know

2025
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:13,040
too divisive yes

2026
02:44:19,280 --> 02:44:24,480
I think it might be too too too much for people like people will be like in a fight about it you know

2027
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:33,680
um let's see I like lavender I like uh

2028
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:40,800
there's a lot of

2029
02:44:41,360 --> 02:44:48,800
pros uh floral floral flavors I don't really see them often

2030
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:57,520
like just edible flowers um I like uh I like what's uh butterfly pee

2031
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:06,000
PEA not not PE okay it's got this like fantastic kind of uh

2032
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:12,960
um kind of earthy flavor to it

2033
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:21,440
it's got an earthy flavor to it really sweet it's got a very interesting um

2034
02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:32,640
um what's the word it's got a very interesting chemistry to it so if you put citrus into butterfly

2035
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:44,560
PT um it turns like kind of like a mauve color the original color is kind of this blue color

2036
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:51,120
but if you put it if you put like a citrus in it it turns like a kind of mauve purplish reddish

2037
02:45:51,120 --> 02:46:01,120
color it's it's got a very earthy taste so in order I think that would really um my favorite

2038
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:11,760
uh drink for that uh uh bubble tea plate tea plate place a bubble tea place makes it really well

2039
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:20,000
which is a like coconut coconut and butterfly tea and it like has this like really really uh

2040
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:31,920
really um kind of like sweet sweet and like mellow taste to it it's like my favorite

2041
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:38,560
it's like my favorite it's very it's the uh coconut that they put in it's like a very

2042
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:44,080
neck it's it's like a syrup that's like very sweet but it's like my favorite thing uh

2043
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:51,840
uh the one place that is surprisingly has it still uh is a bubble tea place that

2044
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:57,200
surprisingly still has it I'm hoping that they have it for like the rest of their life

2045
02:46:58,240 --> 02:47:02,880
this is supposed to be a limited edition drink and I am not I am not wanting it to go away

2046
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:16,480
I'm not wanting it to go away so I just this one store one store still has it and I'm I always

2047
02:47:16,480 --> 02:47:30,160
have to drive really really far away to get it it's like it it's sort of like a boba but it

2048
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:35,520
doesn't it doesn't come with any like uh tapioca or anything

2049
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:48,720
it doesn't have it's probably me it's probably me the only person keeping it in stock right now

2050
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:54,320
because I'm probably the only person who orders it I'm probably the only person who orders it so

2051
02:47:54,320 --> 02:48:04,000
they still have enough stock but it's really nice

2052
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:19,200
like it doesn't come with tapioca personally I don't like tapioca um because I'll tell you uh

2053
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:25,120
I'll tell you it's a little secret

2054
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:37,280
I'll tell you a little secret senpai oh senpai thank you so much for gifting uh and membership

2055
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:39,120
membership uh boy thank you

2056
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:52,640
um I'll tell you a secret tapioca it's sort of dangerous because some places will make

2057
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:57,360
the tapioca taste better by coating it in egg whites

2058
02:48:57,360 --> 02:49:12,880
so it gives it a bit more of a slimmer slimmer feel and a uh and many people really like the taste

2059
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:24,160
of it so it's really dangerous to have tapioca in bubble tea because tapioca is dangerous

2060
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:37,600
it's always eggs uh I never knew that it had it so I always have like a

2061
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:45,920
I would say uh I think they always have like an allergy warning sometimes but

2062
02:49:47,360 --> 02:49:49,360
I hate I hate it I hate it

2063
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:55,120
so I never really get um

2064
02:49:57,360 --> 02:50:03,040
I never get tapioca so I always order it without tapioca the jelly is usually good

2065
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:05,600
depending like the jelly is usually good

2066
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:14,000
usually good it depends really

2067
02:50:14,080 --> 02:50:20,400
now I'm allergic to eggs

2068
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:31,360
I'm like super allergic to eggs I'm like so I tend to not get anything with tapioca

2069
02:50:34,320 --> 02:50:38,000
there's a lot of things that surprisingly have eggs in it like smoothies

2070
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:45,600
smoothies have eggs a lot of smoothie has eggs because they put in protein powder

2071
02:50:47,440 --> 02:50:48,960
and protein powder has eggs

2072
02:50:57,840 --> 02:51:02,720
isn't it awful a lot of a lot of ice cream has eggs in it

2073
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:16,880
I have to be extra careful sometimes certain cheeses have eggs which is kind of awful in itself

2074
02:51:22,480 --> 02:51:26,320
and a lot of different pastas of course

2075
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:29,120
senpai

2076
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:31,520
senpai

2077
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:39,680
bidet thank you for the 499 super chat looked up a list of weird ice cream

2078
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:46,240
uh flavors which one would you eat horse meat beef tongue uh pit fight for octopus yellow

2079
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:51,440
mustard lobster uh I of that list

2080
02:51:54,800 --> 02:52:00,800
probably beef tongue I mean I've I've been to Japan and they had like

2081
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:07,360
corn corn potage ice cream flavors like if you go to like

2082
02:52:09,440 --> 02:52:14,720
if you go to like Japan they'll always have a gattie gattie koon in like a weird flavor

2083
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:23,040
like I remember they had like a really weird

2084
02:52:24,720 --> 02:52:31,840
spaghetti flavor or gattie gattie koon apparently the one

2085
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:39,760
that's the one gattie gattie koon that people really like and they like put it in ramen was like

2086
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:44,720
a butter a butter uh gattie gattie koon

2087
02:52:50,720 --> 02:52:56,000
and I think they put it into like ramen and it was like really good

2088
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:01,840
I was lucky when I was in Japan I got the uh

2089
02:53:02,080 --> 02:53:09,600
I got the uh what do you call it I got the the stick the the coveted stick

2090
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:16,080
that you can get a free one you get a free gattie gattie koon I never got to use it though

2091
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:27,440
apparently it's so hard to find it's really hard to find so people just try to collect them instead

2092
02:53:27,440 --> 02:53:38,400
yeah so if you eat the gattie gattie koon and it has it has like words on the stick and it says

2093
02:53:38,400 --> 02:53:45,040
you get a uh it says winner you get a free uh free gattie gattie koon basically

2188
03:07:05,120 --> 03:07:07,520
me really clumsy and then

2189
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:14,160
hang out with the dog the dog a lot and

2190
03:07:14,960 --> 03:07:24,160
we watched in yasha and there's not much we just did like we just like gossip and stuff

2191
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:36,400
we just gossiped and stuff it wasn't really anything oh what I did uh on the day that I

2192
03:07:36,400 --> 03:07:39,520
was heading home we dropped by an antique um

2193
03:07:43,200 --> 03:07:54,240
an antique shop and the antique shop for some reason has video games like brand new switch video games

2194
03:07:58,640 --> 03:08:04,880
and so I found a really cool game uh for for not too much not too much money

2195
03:08:06,640 --> 03:08:14,320
I was kind of weird like inside was like all these like oh cups and like uh you know like

2196
03:08:15,040 --> 03:08:20,240
figures and kind of like really really old furniture and stuff and then

2197
03:08:22,480 --> 03:08:28,720
right in the corner there's like brand new video games sealed video games and I was like

2198
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:36,480
uh it was someone selling like a bunch of like the switch games

2199
03:08:41,280 --> 03:08:46,960
a game did you get or is it a surprise um I got

2200
03:08:52,320 --> 03:08:53,840
what was the game that I got again

2201
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:07,440
ah I got uh it was a it was a pretty decent price I got um

2202
03:09:11,120 --> 03:09:13,120

2203
03:09:16,480 --> 03:09:21,440

I got fates and stella link

2205
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:40,000
so that one's supposed to be a really good game uh it was like sealed and I think it was like a

2206
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:46,960
limited edition version too so that was really cool that's really cool that was like the limited

2207
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:52,640
edition and it was still sealed it was kind of like um still

2208
03:09:57,680 --> 03:10:05,920
it was like in really good condition so I was like okay so I got it it wasn't for too expensive

2209
03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:10,800
so I decided to like get it and I was like oh okay the other games though were really expensive

2210
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:16,480
also bidet shut up about the stick okay

2211
03:10:19,280 --> 03:10:20,480

2212
03:10:20,480 --> 03:10:34,160

2213
03:10:37,920 --> 03:10:43,760
anyway what am I saying um yeah I got I got the game it was I I didn't know why there were other

2216
03:11:00,960 --> 03:11:02,000

2217
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:07,600

2218
03:11:08,240 --> 03:11:12,240

I hate that name I don't really like it not really like it although it's really funny

2226
03:12:12,400 --> 03:12:15,840
funny people are like oh did you have a choice in your name not really

2227
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:19,360
not really

2228
03:12:24,640 --> 03:12:25,440
not really

2229
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:34,720
I just remember going oh oh yeah I love this name and then come back no

2230
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:44,000
that's a bad name here this is your newest high name thank you I said thank you

2231
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:55,840
Julius Caesar oh speaking of I found out my birthday was not even just the death of Julius Caesar

2232
03:12:55,840 --> 03:12:56,480
guess what

2233
03:13:06,080 --> 03:13:11,520
I found out yesterday that my birthday is also home inside

2234
03:13:15,440 --> 03:13:22,400
every March 15th in Japan there's a fertility festival

2235
03:13:26,160 --> 03:13:31,200
so

2236
03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:49,280
it's the fertility festival

2237
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:54,320
so obviously you probably all know it

2238
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,880
you probably all know it there's like a wooden

2239
03:14:01,440 --> 03:14:05,440
um

2240
03:14:11,280 --> 03:14:13,920
wooden object

2241
03:14:16,960 --> 03:14:17,440
object

2242
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:27,440
I don't want to say stick anymore okay

2243
03:14:31,840 --> 03:14:33,680
I don't want to say stick anymore

2244
03:14:36,240 --> 03:14:39,600
anyways it's a big festival uh

2245
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:49,680
apparently it happens every year on March 15th

2246
03:14:52,800 --> 03:14:54,240
can you believe it

2247
03:15:01,760 --> 03:15:07,840
there's no such a thing as coincidence

2248
03:15:14,640 --> 03:15:21,360
I found out I was like yeah my birthday is so cool

2249
03:15:25,120 --> 03:15:27,040
and then I was like wait

2250
03:15:27,280 --> 03:15:30,480
wait a second

2251
03:15:33,920 --> 03:15:39,760
because if you read my birthday if you known in uh if you know Japanese

2252
03:15:44,720 --> 03:15:52,480
if you read uh March 15th is is Sae Ko

2253
03:15:57,280 --> 03:16:02,320
which as you know phonetically

2254
03:16:05,440 --> 03:16:07,360
phonetically sounds like

2255
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:10,160
cycle

2256
03:16:14,480 --> 03:16:15,840
or it also means the best

2257
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:24,400
it also happens to be the day that Caesar died

2258
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:30,000
and the whole inside

2259
03:16:33,360 --> 03:16:40,880
oh my god

2260
03:16:40,880 --> 03:16:52,720
so

2261
03:16:56,160 --> 03:16:58,720
there's just so many layers here

2262
03:16:59,600 --> 03:17:02,560
