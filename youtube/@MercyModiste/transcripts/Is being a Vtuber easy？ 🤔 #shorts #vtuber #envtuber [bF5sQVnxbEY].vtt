Being a VTuber must be so easy.

00:01.760 --> 00:02.540
WRONG!

00:02.540 --> 00:08.080
It might look fine on the surface, but I assure you, everything can, and will go wrong at one point.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.460
1. Your model tracking can glitch out.

00:11.460 --> 00:17.500
2. Your audio can break overnight, even though you haven't changed a single setting from the last time you stream.

00:17.500 --> 00:23.000
3. Your PC can and will randomly bug you to update in the middle of an emotional scene in the video game.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.880
4. Your internet provider will decide that right before you stream to die and offer you a tiddly wink of bandwidth,

00:28.880 --> 00:30.880
even though you pay premium rates.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.760
5. Your audience won't be notified of the things you're up to.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.200
Aw, thanks to the algorithm game on social media!

00:37.200 --> 00:41.960
So you constantly get people confused when you reference an older stream that they have no idea about.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.600
Should I keep going because I can complain all night long, Senpai?
