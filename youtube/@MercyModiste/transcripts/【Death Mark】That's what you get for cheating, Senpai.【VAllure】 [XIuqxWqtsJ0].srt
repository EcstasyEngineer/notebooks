1
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:47,740
I'm sorry everyone I uh wouldn't stop hiccuping before stream I wouldn't stop

2
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,240
hiccuping before stream and then I drank a lot of water I wouldn't stop

3
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
hiccuping and then I stopped hiccuping and then my tummy started to hurt really

4
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:14,360
badly. But hello everyone. Serenity raided me I missed it I'm sorry. Serenity

5
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:22,000
still here thank you for the raid and welcome everyone to the stream welcome

6
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,120
Senpai. Today we are playing a game called Deathmark. I won't lie to you I've

7
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,520
played a bit of this game before but then I put it on a very long hiatus and

8
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,880
totally forgot about everything that happened to it and I did this twice

9
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:49,400
already. So if I feel like I'm starting to remember some stuff that's why and I'm

10
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:57,120
on a completely new account. Let's go! I mean hold on. Let's go!

11
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:16,800
Hey want to hit up the karaoke place? The new love and hero song is out.

12
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I'm not feeling it. I'm not feeling up to it today. This story creeped me out

13
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:41,920
earlier. Do you want to hear it? Oh chair. You remember Miss Yamaguchi? She wears

14
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:57,080
those big glasses. I heard she's gone missing. What? No one knows where she is?

15
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:10,160
Nope she just disappeared. Just up and poofed from the library. Okay new voice

16
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:16,800
time. One of the student librarians said she was researching something there but

17
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,080
then she vanished. But she's super diligent right? One of the students thought

18
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:32,440
it was weird that she'd up and leave like that. So he checked in on her. But when he

19
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:47,280
did, the only thing left was her arm. Had her really weird scar on it. So it was

20
00:13:47,280 --> 00:14:00,120
definitely her arm. A scar? Yeah. It looked like a dog bite. He showed it to me

21
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:14,920
once. Had no idea where it came from. Burial? There was a scar like that on

22
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:32,280
Miki's leg too. Huh? Miki? Wait that's the girl who went missing. Yeah. It's crazy. Maybe

23
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:42,840
that rumor's true. The one about the cursed scar. Cut it out. You're scaring me. I forgot

24
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:56,920
which Valley Girl was who now. Sorry. I hear snatches of an idiotic ghost stories. They're

25
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,640
speaking seriously. It's obvious that they don't believe a word. They're only

26
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:16,520
killing time. Rumors are the best way to do that. The sun's about to set. It's gotten

27
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:34,400
later than I planned. I shouldn't have stuck around to hear that story. I better hurry.

28
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:59,600
Bye tonight else. Thunder rumbles in the distance. A huge mansion is in front of me. Strange.

29
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:11,560
I'm sure I was just. My vision blurs. My ears are buzzing. My head's swimming. It's

30
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:21,280
almost like I'm drunk. What time is it? A glass at my wrist, but my watch is gone. I

31
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:29,600
put it in my coat pocket. And all I find is a business card. In elegant printed letters

32
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:40,560
is a name. Saya Kujo, spirit healer. On the back is a photo of the mansion. I guess this

33
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:50,680
must be Kujo Mansion then? Kujo Mansion, Saya Kujo. Those names sound familiar somehow.

34
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:58,000
One way to find out, taking a deep breath, I reach out to knock. I stop when I see something

35
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:12,480
on my wrist. It's a strange scar. Wonder that. I could just be imagining this, but feel an

36
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:29,280
icy chill when I look at it. My fur, my fists pounds on the door, no reply. A light appears

37
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,200
in the second floor window. It's probably too far from the door for them to hear me

38
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:45,560
knocking. Don't they have doorbells in this day and age? I grafts the door knob and find

39
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:55,360
it unlocked. No point in staying outside. I'll just go in. I'll apologize to the owner

40
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:11,400
later. Inside is shrouded in darkness. A small beam of light from the window is the

41
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,800
only way I can see anything in here. It's dead silent except for the constant ticking

42
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:29,360
of a clock's second hand. I must be in the entrance hall. The atrium extends to the second

43
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:39,720
floor. Anyone home? There's no reply to my shout. Maybe they've soundproofed this place

44
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,840
so they can't hear me downstairs. I guess I need to go upstairs then. A staircase is

45
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:55,560
just visible up ahead. I walk towards it, cutting across the hall. With what light? My ears catch a

46
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:08,720
strange noise. I turn to look where it's coming from. Someone's there. I fell up by the dark.

47
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:24,080
I think they're staring at me. What should we do? Ten pie! I'm gonna approach them. What do you

48
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:37,760
guys want to do? I'm gonna approach them. Gulping. I hesitantly make my way over.

49
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:47,520
Trepidation slowing my steps. Ooh! Trepidation! That's a good idea. Word of the day everyone!

50
00:19:47,520 --> 00:20:04,040
Trepidation! It's a young girl. She doesn't move an inch as I approach. Girl, you just had

51
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:18,720
your eyes open. I know you did. At least it seems that way to me. Doesn't look like she's even

52
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:30,800
breathing. They're corpse? Great, I creep myself out. I start to sweat. What should I do?

53
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:59,160
Sampai! I'm gonna do the bad touch. The shaky hand, I slowly reach out and touch your skin.

54
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm not sure what I expected, but it feels unnatural somehow. It's stiff and cold.

55
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:30,600
I press down on her arm and she makes the strange sound I heard earlier. Ah, now it makes sense.

56
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:40,840
She's a doll. A doll's joint creak when they move. That's what made the noise. Not a relief if disappointing.

57
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,360
I carefully begin climbing the stairs, making sure not to trip.

58
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:05,880
As I reach the landing, the sharp sound of a bell breaks the silence. It seems to be coming from above me.

59
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:16,600
Looking up, I can spy the outline of a cloth. I bet that's what's making the sound.

60
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:30,680
Should we approach it? Approach it or wait? What do you think, Sampai?

61
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,760
It's a group activity. Wait, wait, wait, okay.

62
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,960
Okay, let's see.

63
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,560
I saw wait first, so we're gonna do wait.

64
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,120
I pause and wait for the clamor to end.

65
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,920
It doesn't seem to be stopping. Maybe it's broken. Okay, I guess we don't wait then.

66
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,480
Should we approach it then?

67
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,520
Approach it menacingly.

68
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,920
Oh, the noise guides me over.

69
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,280
It's an antique grandfather clock. The noise is definitely coming from here.

70
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,200
I reach toward the glass to check inside.

71
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,000
All of a sudden, it stops chiming.

72
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,320
Silence descends, broken only by ticking.

73
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:12,120
I guess it's fixed now, but that timing was a little too spot on. Was it really a coincidence?

74
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:21,160
All these strange occurrences make me uneasy, but I continue on to the room with the light.

75
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,720
Stopping in front of the door, I knock.

76
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,600
But again, there's no reply.

77
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:49,960
I try again several times, even calling out, but there's still no answer. I push on the door.

78
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,040
It's dark inside. What's that on the ground?

79
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,320
Strange, I definitely saw lights on in here when I was outside.

80
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,640
Wafting through the room is an odd smell.

81
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,200
It's sugary, like ripe fruit. The whole room is permeated with it.

82
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,840
Some kind of aromatherapy, maybe? And a particularly pleasant smell, though.

83
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,080
The aroma draws me further into the room.

84
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,440
And the floor under my feet feels off. It's wet.

85
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,560
It dawns on me that I'm smelling something else mixed with the sweet smell.

86
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,440
Chat sometimes blocks the dialogue window. Can you adjust the game screen?

87
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,400
Okie dokie.

88
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,280
It doesn't look that great, but is this okay, Senpai?

89
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,760
Good.

90
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:34,600
Well, you didn't want to just hear the sound of my voice. You needed your subtitles so that you can go along with me.

91
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:54,440
We need to practice reading for your USL classes, of course. Okie dokie.

92
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:04,920
But, like, oh yeah, I clicked off the screen. I know this scent. This metallic tang.

93
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,920
Lightning flashes, then catch a glimpse of something.

94
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,840
The startling grotesque object stretches out across the floor beneath my feet.

95
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,760
Something strange is there.

96
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,800
What should we do? Stare at it?

97
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,040
Should we stare at it? We're gonna stare.

98
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Alright. So bizarre that I can't stop staring.

99
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,400
Blooming flowers are everywhere.

100
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,080
They're bursting out of the woman's stomach. A blood-soaked body overwhelmed with them.

101
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,600
I really hate the look of Lotus Pods. I absolutely hate the look of him.

102
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:32,840
I wrench my gaze away, horrified. But the hellish image is burned into my mind. I can feel my entire body shaking.

103
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:43,560
Bio-Rises. I'm gonna throw up. Haha, what's new?

104
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,000
In the next instant, the lights are on.

105
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,160
Wait, that's not all. The body is gone, leaving only a stain.

106
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:25,880
This doesn't make sense. Bad dream, at least. I'd really, had really much preferred if it was

107
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,280
the faint smell that remains in the blood-stained crush my any hope I had of it.

108
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:40,520
I beat a retreat from the room in an effort to escape this whole bizarre situation.

109
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,440
When I stumble back into the hall, the lights are on in here as well.

110
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,040
I decide to have another look around. While the furnishing in here are old enough to be antiques,

111
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,160
I match this old-fashioned mansion.

112
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,040
A large doll sits on a couch. This must be the figure I saw in the dark.

113
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,840
One would easily mistake this for a human if they couldn't see the ball joints.

114
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,880
Probably belongs to the owner of the mansion.

115
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,160
But what do I do now?

116
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,160
Contact the police?

117
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,320
Their stomach was full of flour, sir, and the corpse stopped and vanished like fog.

118
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,320
Like anyone would believe that.

119
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,520
Welcome. Welcome to Kujo Mansion.

120
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,320
The doll moved and spoke.

121
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,120
A different kind of shutter runs through me, and the one I found, the corpse.

122
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,600
Up until this point, I was nothing more than an observer to all these freaky events.

123
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:22,360
I could distance myself from it, but now a doll is talking to me.

124
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,680
Have I startled you?

125
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,400
If so, I sincerely apologize.

126
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:38,360
My master ordered me to behave like a normal doll until told otherwise.

127
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:45,400
The words are elegant and refined, but her face never moves an inch.

128
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,320
She may look human, but she clearly isn't.

129
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,320
She slowly folds her hands together, though she can move too.

130
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,720
I'm sorry for not introducing myself.

131
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,520
I'm called Mary.

132
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,680
You have likely seen a number of oddities here already.

133
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,160
I see my master, Zaya Kujo, was unable to escape from the mark then.

134
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,920
Zaya Kujo, does she mean that corpse?

135
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,120
But wait, what about this mark?

136
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,720
What about this bell to mark?

137
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,560
Lady Zaya was searching for a way to escape the mark.

138
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,960
Were you not also called here by her because of the mark on your arm?

139
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,560
She must be talking about this weird scar.

140
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,480
Did Zaya Kujo invite me to this mansion?

141
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,440
When I try to remember, my head hurts.

142
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,280
I have something to tell you in place of my light master,

143
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,840
but I would like to ask one thing first.

144
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,520
Do you know your own name?

145
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,720
Well, that was a much simpler question than I had been expecting.

146
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,240
It's...

147
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:33,400
I break out into a sweat.

148
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,400
My throat is drying up.

149
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,440
Why?

150
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,560
Why can't I answer?

151
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,680
I'm shocked to find I'm coming up blank.

152
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,840
I see.

153
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,400
Then it is as I thought.

154
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,480
Somehow, Mary knows what's going on with me.

155
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:59,160
Before I offer an explanation, please decide on a temporary name.

156
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,400
Things will go much easier if I have a name I wish to call you.

157
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,640
It is also likely you will find it hard to remain calm if you are nameless.

158
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,920
She's probably right.

159
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:23,000
Better to have some placeholder name than continue life as a hollow nameless being.

160
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,040
Enter the protagonist's last name, up to 10 letters.

161
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,160
Okay, delete.

162
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,160
No, no, no, no, no.

163
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,280
Last name.

164
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:59,800
First name.

165
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:23,800
Oops.

166
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,800
We have to deduce formalities, of course.

167
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,000
He's literally you, for real, for real.

168
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,800
Senpai, Senpai.

169
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:55,400
Can't it be Senpai Modest?

170
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,600
No, I have to take your last name, Senpai.

171
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
So it's Senpai Senpai.

172
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,520
Yes.

173
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,440
It's Senpai Senpai, okay.

174
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,640
It cannot be changed.

175
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,640
Yeah.

176
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,200
Not Darling Senpai?

177
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,760
Well, then it would say Darling.

178
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,160
Depending on the person, they'll say Darling-san, Senpai-san.

179
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,040
I want to Senpai-san, Senpai-san.

180
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,200
Okay.

181
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,520
You okay with others calling you Senpai?

182
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,080
Of course.

183
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,320
Now, if they have a crush on you, on the other hand, that's different.

184
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:13,320
After all, Senpai must be Senpai in every situation.

185
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,080
Besides, if you die, that's just in character, isn't it?

186
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,560
She berayed.

187
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,800
Excuse me, I got to adjust myself.

188
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:39,960
Okay.

189
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,480
Welcome, Raiders.

190
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,840
Welcome.

191
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Welcome my baby girl.

192
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,600
She be cotton bomb.

193
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,560
Welcome to the stream.

194
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,520
Welcome, welcome.

195
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,080
We are naming the protagonist right now.

196
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,760
How was your stream?

197
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,800
I totally forgot what you were playing because I was out all day.

198
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,760
Gosh, I love my gen mate so much.

199
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,280
But I can go back and be like, hold on.

200
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,360
Fine, fine.

201
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,800
You guys, you have variety now.

202
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,120
Fine.

203
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,880
I'll give you variety, Senpai.

204
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,800
I went Dar-villor.

205
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,040
V-Darling.

206
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Wow, that's going to be...

207
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,720
When is someone going to start that up, huh?

208
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,520
Chibis was fighting tamper vampires, now fighting Fa.

209
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,200
Like the food, right?

210
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,440
Oh, I spelled Senpai wrong.

211
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Do I even love Senpai if I spell Senpai's name wrong?

212
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,320
Oh, fuck it.

213
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,120
There we go.

214
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,960
There we go.

215
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,680
Senpai, darling.

216
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,080
Okay?

217
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,120
The dyslexia hitting.

218
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,240
Oh, oh, we get to choose our luck.

219
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,280
Senpai, you get to choose the luck.

220
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,640
Look, do you want glasses and beard?

221
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,360
Beard?

222
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,400
Just glasses?

223
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,800
Nothing?

224
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,000
You want to wear glasses?

225
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,360
You want to just have a beard?

226
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,560
Just glasses?

227
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,680
I just see glasses.

228
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
Okay, glasses it is.

229
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,080
It's this okay?

230
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,120
Yeah, let's fucking go.

231
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,600
I'm...

232
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,080
Excuse me.

233
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,480
I'm Senpai, darling.

234
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Understood, Lord Darling.

235
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,880
Now, I shall explain to you about the mark.

236
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,240
It is the Seal of Death.

237
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Those who have it will soon die.

238
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,400
You do not believe me?

239
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,960
I'm certain this sounds absurd to want to know.

240
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,960
I'm sure it's the seal of death.

241
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
I'm sure it's the seal of death.

242
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,720
I'm certain this sounds absurd to want you as loved at an eventful life.

243
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,000
However, my master's death proves it to be irrefutably true.

244
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,000
The Carps?

245
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,560
The Carp's sweet stench comes back to me.

246
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,160
It didn't seem like the work of humans.

247
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:59,480
I'm afraid that the horror of the mark does not stop there.

248
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,960
Victims slowly lose their memories until the day they die.

249
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:12,840
They face death all the while suffering from the terror of losing oneself.

250
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,440
Memory loss?

251
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,080
I can't be that.

252
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,360
That would mean that I'm...

253
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,520
Yes.

254
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,680
The fact that you have forgotten your name proves that death is coming.

255
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,640
Lord Darling, you...

256
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,080
...will die this very dawn.

257
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,760
Death mark.

258
00:42:51,400 --> 00:43:01,160
Yes, I think I named the protagonist aptly.

259
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,760
Remember, senpai, your mortality is always finite.

260
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,480
My memories skip forward a bit after that.

261
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,160
I just remember being completely stunned at what Mary revealed to me.

262
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,760
I can probably attribute it to memory loss caused by the mark.

263
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,240
The next thing I know...

264
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,640
...I'm lying in a guest room in the mansion.

265
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:51,400
I vaguely recall dragging myself up the stairs and coming here.

266
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,680
I must have fallen asleep at some point, and thanks to that I feel a lot better.

267
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,120
I'll die at dawn, huh?

268
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,280
I try saying it out loud.

269
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,080
It's definitely shocking, but I can't say it feels real yet.

270
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,120
It doesn't make sense, way out of the blue.

271
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,280
But if it's true, is waiting for my untimely death the only thing I can do?

272
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,920
It might be a good idea to ask Mary more about it.

273
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,520
I find Mary sitting in the exact same spot as before.

274
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,520
She hasn't moved an inch.

275
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,000
I doubt a doll gets bored waiting like humans do.

276
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,480
Good morning.

277
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,360
Good morning, Lord, darling.

278
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,600
Maybe we should save before I do something crazy?

279
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,120
Is there a save option?

280
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:14,200
Are you... are you feeling better now?

281
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Well, how do you feel, Senpai?

282
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,880
Yeah, you're fine.

283
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,800
Fine, Senpai, you're all fine.

284
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:32,920
Sort of?

285
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, I see more yeses.

286
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,280
That's good to hear.

287
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,720
Yeah, I'm gonna adjust my voice for her, give me a second.

288
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,800
Since it appears that you have calmed down, I would like to ask you a question.

289
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,680
Okay, yeah, I think this is better.

290
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,440
What do you guys think?

291
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,840
What does Senpai think?

292
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yeah, I'm gonna go up here.

293
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,760
What will you do now?

294
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,920
I can guide you down only two paths.

295
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,040
The first is to wait for death.

296
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,320
The second is to fight the mark.

297
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,600
Can... can you help me?

298
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,360
If that is what you wish, yes.

299
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,200
My master was researching the mark.

300
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,240
A few days prior to her death, he found a way to escape it.

301
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,720
Regretfully, she passed away before she was able to inform me.

302
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,720
So she doesn't know anything after all.

303
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,560
There is some time yet before dawn.

304
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,360
You have a slim chance.

305
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,760
Salvation is a thin thread dangling from heaven.

306
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,520
Would you put that you would grab hold of?

307
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,560
And I shall do my utmost to help.

308
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,400
What will you do?

309
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,480
I guess this boils down to whether I trust her.

310
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,000
If she's right about all this, my time on earth is up at dawn.

311
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,720
If I don't want to die, then there's no other choice but to resist the mark until then.

312
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,240
If she's lying, I'll be fine when the morning comes.

313
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,800
And am I really alright with that?

314
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,720
Aw, I got blinded.

315
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,880
People are being killed in nonsensical, grotesque ways.

316
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,840
Am I going to turn a blind eye to it?

317
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,440
This is a life or death decision.

318
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,600
I need to think about it carefully.

319
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,400
Live or die.

320
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,360
Deadly choice.

321
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,080
You will be faced with choices that can result in death.

322
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,680
It is limited time and your soul power will continue to drain.

323
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,640
Time's up or wrong answers will result in a game over.

324
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,960
So be quick, but also careful in finding the right answers.

325
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,040
Restoring soul power.

326
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,600
Completing a deadly choice will restore some soul power.

327
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,480
Accelerated dialogue.

328
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,000
Dialogue will be sped up while pressing the left button.

329
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,200
But certain dialogue cannot be sped up.

330
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,400
Backlog.

331
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,320
Start with display previous dialogue.

332
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,320
Auto mode.

333
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,800
The right button will activate auto mode.

334
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,080
Hiding the dialogue window.

335
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,120
You can hide the dialogue window by pressing Y.

336
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:13,640
Then I shall ask you, will you quietly wait for death or struggle against the mark?

337
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,360
We're going to fight the mark, obviously.

338
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:25,740
Safe.

339
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,800
Survived.

340
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,040
I've decided to trust you.

341
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,120
As you say, Lord Diving.

342
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,440
Then I shall carry out the dying wish of my master and aid you.

343
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,800
I cannot do much, but feel free to request anything you wish of me.

344
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,040
I made up my mind, but that doesn't mean I know what I should do.

345
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,000
And I'll squat about the supernatural and losing my memory makes research impossible.

346
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,160
I don't have a moment to lose.

347
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,560
A knock comes from the front door.

348
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,560
It would come here this late at night.

349
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,520
Oh my, what a sign of fate.

350
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,960
It seems the other markbearers have arrived.

351
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Is it instinct that she knows these things?

352
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,480
Maybe she has some kind of mysterious power being a talking doll and all.

353
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,560
I beg your pardon, Lord Diving.

354
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,280
I do apologize.

355
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,320
But could you go greet our guests in my stead?

356
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,720
They may experience a shock of a doll such as myself welcomes them.

357
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,680
Moreover, while I'm able to move my arms, I am unable to walk.

358
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,800
I move to the front door to greet our guests.

359
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,400
People fated to die like me.

360
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,400
I wonder what they're like.

361
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,480
Who I find at the door are not who I expect to see this late at night.

362
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,840
A high schooler and a small boy.

363
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,480
These kids have the mark?

364
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,440
No way.

365
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,960
Um, we came to see Professor Kujo.

366
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:47,800
Who are you?

367
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,760
I can't say I'm a total stranger since I'm here at the mansion.

368
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:54,600
I'm...

369
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:58,360
So...

370
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,960
What do you want?

371
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:04,920
Sampai?

372
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,160
What do you want?

373
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,160
Do you want to be...

374
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,120
her relative?

375
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,040
Her disciple?

376
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,200
Her relative or disciple?

377
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,160
No!

378
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,480
Boyfriend is not an option!

379
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,720
Boyfriend is not an option!

380
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,520
No option!

381
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,920
You're mine!

382
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,560
Mine!

383
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,120
Sampai's cheating on me.

384
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,760
You're not going to make me cry, right?

385
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,960
Okay, let's go with relative.

386
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,520
Oh.

387
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,760
So, you're her older brother.

388
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,400
Your eyes do kind...

389
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,440
Do look kind similar.

390
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,320
Sorry, I've decided to go on with a different voice for her already.

391
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,000
She seems to know Saiyaku-jou.

392
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,840
I think about it, that business card did say Spirit Healer.

393
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,640
Going off this girl's acceptance.

394
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

395
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,840
Going off this girl's accessories, I get the feeling she's a huge occult fan.

396
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,400
I'm Moe Watanabe.

397
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,000
I'm here to talk to her about this article she wrote in no...

398
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,960
Oop! Oop! Arts!

399
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,080
Monthly!

400
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,120
She pulls out an occult magazine out of her bag.

401
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,560
Inside is a picture of the mark.

402
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,040
Accompanying articles as the scar is.

403
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:33,000
A soul-inhibiting disease that erases memories inquire at Kujo Mansion.

404
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,480
Um, this is the same scar, right?

405
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,440
Moe ellipses her skirt up a bit to show me her leg.

406
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,280
Don't look, Senpai!

407
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,200
Right there on her right thigh is the mark.

408
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,280
I think I know what the article means by erasing memories.

409
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,680
I've been super forgetful lately.

410
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,600
I'm even blanking on my friend's names.

411
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,240
That's never happened to me before.

412
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,560
Do you think the scar is doing it?

413
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,280
This article is obviously bogus.

414
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,320
The young boy scoffs.

415
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,960
Even kids know better than to believe in ghosts or curses these days.

416
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,800
And a high schooler fell for it.

417
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,240
You must be embarrassed about this.

418
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:47,800
But Tsukasa, where did you hang around in the front of the Williams Mansion's key?

419
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,360
Biss up, your scar scares you.

420
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,280
Tsukasa seems to have no retort for that.

421
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,440
He silently soaks.

422
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,200
Looks like a bullseye.

423
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,760
It's clear they're both mark-bearers.

424
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,400
Better bring them over to meet Mary.

425
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,880
Moe shrieks excitingly as she gets close.

426
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,920
Oh my god, it's so cute!

427
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,760
It's a doll, yeah?

428
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,360
I've never seen one this big before.

429
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,920
The craftsmanship is so detailed.

430
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,360
It's almost like it's alive.

431
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,920
They're both admiring her one.

432
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,160
Welcome to Kujo Mansion.

433
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,560
What?

434
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,200
It's Spock.

435
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,760
With that, the two new visitors join our numbers.

436
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,440
They enter this monstrous world.

437
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,400
That hover on the precipice of death.

438
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,440
Mary tells Moe and Tsukasa about the mark once they regain their composure.

439
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,600
All about the steady memory loss and their imminent death.

440
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,600
It sounds like a ridiculous story, but it gains validity coming from someone like her.

441
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,200
Both of their faces pale.

442
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:26,600
Now, if you came specifically here because you believe that Lady Sia's article.

443
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:38,600
You must have already experienced the pain of losing your memories.

444
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,400
Moe admitted as much earlier, but I can see Tsukasa's face darken.

445
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,960
So it must be happening to him too.

446
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,320
Oh, what kind of tea today?

447
00:57:51,960 --> 00:58:00,360
I for gore, give me a second as I regain my memory.

448
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,640
I for gore, maybe I have a death mark too.

449
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:30,360
The funny thing is that I specifically picked out this tea

450
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:37,480
because I knew Senpai's would ask, but then I forgot.

451
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,480
Give me a second.

452
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,240
Ah, okay.

453
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:45,800
I remember.

454
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,840
I remember now.

455
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,320
I remember.

456
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,040
It's Tulsi.

457
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,640
Tulsi Ginger.

458
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,240
Tulsi.

459
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,600
I was just about to google the tea brand and be like,

460
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,920
maybe if I look at the labels, I would remember.

461
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:20,040
Is it any good?

462
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:20,920
And yeah, I think so.

463
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,640
It's got kind of like a mellow or earthy taste.

464
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,880
Tulsi.

465
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,640
T-U-L-S-I.

466
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,680
Like, there's a VTuber with that name.

467
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:50,360
There's a VTuber with that name.

468
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,520
I think she's with Sony.

469
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,960
I would repeat a meme that went around.

470
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,040
About her.

471
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,160
Or a viral tweet that went around about her.

472
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:20,120
But that might not be safe for YouTube.

473
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,440
She's on the JP side.

474
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,840
I know, I know, I know.

475
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,720
I know Senpai.

476
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:51,480
I will give you a hint.

477
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,800
I'll give you a hint.

478
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,160
Someone mistook

479
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:19,080
15, 15, 15 men, meaning years, and translated to 15,

480
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,760
about 15,000.

481
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:27,720
I think 15,000 men, so men being year, to 15,000 men.

482
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,880
So I'll let your imagination go wild with that.

483
01:01:35,160 --> 01:02:01,080
I actually watched her debut and everyone was trolling her.

484
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,360
Of course, Sony did a cease and desist on that.

485
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:11,880
So you'll have to just do, well, what did they, what do you guys say?

486
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,200
Do your reps?

487
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:20,280
Yeah, you have to do your reps.

488
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,080
Also, yeah, this week's homework.

489
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:46,360
It's hard to catch up with the lingo that lots of people use.

490
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:54,920
I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting a like crash course on like what, what some things mean.

491
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,280
So yeah,

492
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,480
that was, that was really fun.

493
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,160
Actually, I hear she's a very nice person.

494
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,800
So yeah, I really do like her design though.

495
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,960
If you're, if you're a fan of,

496
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:32,120
um, canoes, canoes, like, like, uh, I see, or Emmy, you might like her design.

497
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,840
It must be happening to him too.

498
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:51,960
I'm going to scoot in closer.

499
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,120
I was totally the wrong voice.

500
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,520
Okay, okay.

501
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:07,960
The peachy kind of light color.

502
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:18,760
Why do I call them canoes?

503
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:29,960
Canoe.

504
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,960
I'm making things up.

505
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:49,000
But I'm talking about, you know, the little, little canoes.

506
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:59,960
You know, the boat, you paddle.

507
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:15,080
Hey, Moe, I'd like to confirm something.

508
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,000
Where were you when you got the mark?

509
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,520
Amnesia seems to be worse than theirs.

510
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,480
They might remember.

511
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,120
The canoes need correction, right?

512
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,960
Yeah, they need to be corrected

513
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:53,080
so that they can, you know, float correctly.

514
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:07,160
They might, so they might remember.

515
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,120
I'm not positive, but

516
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:23,080
I think my mark might have been a curse from Hana Hiko.

517
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,600
Hana Hiko.

518
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:39,080
Thank you, Senpai.

519
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,280
Beto the snippet.

520
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:47,240
Mercy is the only person who is entirely charm points

521
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,480
and we're all lucky to be her Senpai.

522
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,840
Oh, thank you.

523
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,080
You are all lucky.

524
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:06,840
But thank you, Senpai, for the 420.

525
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,080
This name is familiar to me.

526
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,800
He's the ghost of the resident children of this town whisper about, right?

527
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,800
Oh, sorry, it's correct.

528
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,760
My master was interested in him.

529
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:36,440
So Sayakujo was interested, was curious too, could be connected to the mark some day.

530
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,440
I'd like to hear more about this ghost.

531
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,440
As you wish, Lord Darling.

532
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,440
And I shall tell you the rumors of Hana Hiko.

533
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:57,880
Chapter one.

534
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,520
Hana Hiko.

535
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,400
Sorry, I need to do a cuter laugh, right?

536
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,560
Oh, did you hear?

537
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,160
Oops, that was my controller.

538
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:19,160
About the ghost boy, all the schools in H City are talking about.

539
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,480
Sounds like Hana Hiko is back.

540
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:35,880
I heard he can appear if you peek in the school mirror at night or ask you something.

541
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,560
Am I pretty?

542
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,120
If you tell him no, you'll be fine, but you say yes.

543
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,920
I need that red stuff, then.

544
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,480
It just disappears.

545
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,480
But that's not all.

546
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,480
Hana Hiko hates adults, you know.

547
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,440
I heard that if the person he asks is an adult, they'll die.

548
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,840
They'll not just drop dead.

549
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,840
Blood is drained from them.

550
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,320
And next to the carts is a single rose.

551
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,760
Arrows dripping with blood.

552
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:38,120
Remakes can be easily manipulated, passing from one person to another.

553
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:43,160
Assumptions and errors mix in, but they also hold a hint of truth.

554
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,280
Miss Moe, do you know anything else?

555
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:58,520
I probably cut my mark when I was investigating Hana Hiko at each elementary school.

556
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,040
That's got to be some sort of clue.

557
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,040
I should ask her more about it.

558
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,040
Why were you at H Elementary?

559
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,320
My big dream is to write about the cult.

560
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,520
I'd love to see a ghost.

561
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,920
I found this article in a magazine mentioning Hana Hiko was seen there.

562
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,600
I figured that place would be easier to sneak in than a regular school,

563
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,440
since it's been closed down.

564
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,920
What should I ask next?

565
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,680
Was Hana Hiko there?

566
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,200
I don't think so, but I can't really say for sure.

567
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,720
I went to the mirror, but a shipper suddenly ran down my spine and I got spooked and left.

568
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,040
What should I ask next?

569
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,960
When did you notice the mark?

570
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,280
I noticed it later in the bath.

571
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,320
A strange scar was suddenly on my thigh.

572
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,360
It really surprised me.

573
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,760
I realized immediately it had to be what Professor Kujo wrote about.

574
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,000
Fellow high-patch haver, I have an iPad in real life.

575
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,600
Twinsies!

576
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,360
You know, when I think, I think I recall.

577
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,120
Is this a spoiler?

578
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,280
But I did guess this before I played the game.

579
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:27,720
Well, no, when I first played the game, I think I guessed that the red stuff is like lipstick or something.

580
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,800
Rouge, perhaps?

581
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,800
Perhaps Rouge?

582
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,920
I don't know what kind of makeup.

583
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,480
They had in Japan, really.

584
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,400
I think I have a handle on what happened.

585
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,520
No way to know for sure about the ghost, but if there's no denying,

586
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,720
she had the mark after returning home from age elementary.

587
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,400
And then, maybe, Tsukasa glanced down at his left hand.

588
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,520
The line might be from behind a Hiko tooth.

589
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,280
I noticed it after I got home from tea elementary.

590
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,720
That ghost was seen a lot in schools in each city, right?

591
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,160
Maybe he remembered something, but I asked him some questions too.

592
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:28,920
Tea elementary?

593
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,080
Got a school there.

594
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,520
You've probably heard of it since it's a top ranked elementary in each city.

595
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,520
What should I ask next?

596
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:39,880
When was that?

597
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,960
A year-round sunset?

598
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,560
I was heading home until I realized I forgot something and turned back.

599
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,400
Should I ask Mips and just see Hena Hiko?

600
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,840
No, and I didn't get chills or anything either.

601
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,160
Oh, but I think I passed a mirror.

602
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,720
I went to the bathroom before going home.

603
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,200
I don't think he knows anymore.

604
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,480
Stories are pretty similar to the Hena Hiko rooms.

605
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,360
They can't just be coins in this.

606
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:14,600
You must invest to eat the places for Hena Hiko up here.

607
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,040
For their sake, as well as yours.

608
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,040
Ah, well, that sounds all well and good, but...

609
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,920
What exactly am I investigating?

610
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,200
Death and life coexistence.

611
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:33,240
The mark originated there, and a way to erase it will also be there.

612
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,240
Did I get breathier for her voice?

613
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:43,480
Oh my goodness, I can't keep track of the voices I'm making for each character.

614
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,840
I must be so tired some pie.

615
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,240
I must be so tired.

616
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,120
No, that was totally not the voice I did.

617
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,120
I did like a really creepy voice, huh?

618
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,760
My bad.

619
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,400
You must find it.

620
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,440
Break the key.

621
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,440
You need to break the mark's curse.

622
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,640
Wait, find the key, and then I'll make the...

623
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,760
Oh my gosh, oh.

624
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:25,720
Maybe doing a visual novel for my last day of my debut week was definitely...

625
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:33,080
It was definitely a little bit short-sighted on my side.

626
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,680
That is the only way to escape.

627
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,040
And all of a sudden, a huge burden was dropped on my shoulders.

628
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,840
We can go back to Harvester?

629
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,560
No, no, no.

630
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:00,920
If I pick something, we're playing that today unless it's like completely terrible.

631
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:16,200
But I will add Harvester back onto the schedule.

632
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,200
Probably the week after.

633
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,400
It seems...

634
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,120
It seems that Hanahiko appeared at two schools.

635
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,040
Where will you investigate?

636
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,040
Okay, okay.

637
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,080
Logic time.

638
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,760
Logic time, Senpai.

639
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,880
We're probably going to go to H Elementary instead of T Elementary,

640
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:48,440
because T Elementary is most likely severely guarded since it's a prestigious school,

641
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,480
and H Elementary might not be as guarded.

642
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,640
Are we still doing Markiller 7 as well?

643
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,120
Of course.

644
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:11,480
Yeah, that's probably wise.

645
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,240
I'd arrest you on the spot if you tried to sneak into a regular school.

646
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,200
I told you!

647
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,000
I told you!

648
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:23,560
H Elementary might be a-ha-h-ha-aunted.

649
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,520
Scared of a little security?

650
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,720
Yeah, just a little bit.

651
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,040
A middle-aged man who can't recall his name,

652
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,440
let alone his address or job title.

653
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,040
Would have no excuse if I got caught.

654
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,760
Wanna get going then?

655
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,200
Let's do this!

656
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,880
Let's do this!

657
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,480
Wait, you're coming too?

658
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,320
Of course!

659
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,880
I haven't given up on seeing Hanahiko yet.

660
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,760
She grins at me.

661
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,840
Is she really strong, or is this blind optimism?

662
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,960
I'm going too.

663
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,160
Hey, not you two, seriously.

664
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,720
My life's on the line here.

665
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,120
I don't want the reason I die to be,

666
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,800
because you messed up something.

667
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,920
You messed something up.

668
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,800
Oh, dang!

669
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,080
This kid has no just on me and me, and they'll be right!

670
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,200
That's pretty bold.

671
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,160
Good thing you're cute.

672
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,960
But to bring kids along with me is...

673
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,920
I understand your hesitation,

674
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,960
but the mark does not discriminate,

675
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,960
stealing lives of children and adults.

676
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,120
They wish to fight their fate.

677
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,560
We should honor that.

678
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,800
I suppose human logic doesn't fly

679
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,400
when dealing with the supernatural.

680
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,560
We'll need to prepare ourselves

681
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,160
for the worst if we're gonna survive.

682
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:05,400
Please take only one mark bearer with you, however.

683
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,680
A large group will increase the odds

684
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,360
of you being detected by spirits.

685
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,520
I also ask that you not waste time

686
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,040
dwindling with others on the way.

687
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,280
It is possible.

688
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,160
Unnecessary contact may hasten the effect of the mark.

689
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,680
Only engage when absolutely necessary.

690
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,160
Keep contact with others to a minimum.

691
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,840
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna say.

692
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,280
Have a safe trip.

693
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,880
Okay, we are not bringing the tiny child.

694
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,880
Selecting a partner.

695
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,200
First, select a mark bearer.

696
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,480
Do this in partner menu.

697
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,320
Oh, yeah!

698
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,120
Hey, mister!

699
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,280
How do you think it'll be a good idea

700
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,360
to take notes on what Mary's told us?

701
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,000
Your memory's getting worse all the time.

702
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,280
We don't want to forget anything.

703
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:06,920
I don't know when I'll lose my memory again.

704
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,320
All right, down all the information I get

705
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,360
and keep it in my file.

706
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,800
Something in it might just save our lives at some point.

707
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,040
New info was added to the spirit file

708
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,960
rumor of Hanna Hiko other.

709
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,440
Spirit file.

710
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,880
Important info on spirits will be added

711
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:28,920
to the spirit file.

712
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,640
Check it from your bag.

713
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,240
Consult it if you need help.

714
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,120
Saving and loading.

715
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,560
Save at the mansion or hunts.

716
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,360
Return to the title screen from the bag

717
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,280
to live for your luck to load.

718
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,400
Then choose continue.

719
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,560
Wait, X to save.

720
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,520
Ho, ho, ho!

721
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,200
Look, we finally got the save.

722
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,040
Partner.

723
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,040
We are not taking the smart one.

724
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,960
The smart mouth and child.

725
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,880
I would want to leave this kid behind.

726
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,880
We'll take, we'll take.

727
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:05,960
I knew it!

728
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,120
I knew her voice was ganky.

729
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:13,560
Did you hear that?

730
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,440
She's super ganky.

731
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:18,920
Big.

732
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,160
Okay, Hanna Hiko.

733
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,760
Okay, that's not all.

734
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,640
Kujo mansion.

735
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,560
Yes, adults.

736
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,360
It hates adults.

737
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,280
Okay, the red stuff.

738
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,680
Okay, and.

739
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

740
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:40,920
Not that.

741
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:43,720
Exit.

742
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,840
First, first we have to get to H elementary.

743
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,400
Am I pretty ganky?

744
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,440
Ganky Senpai.

745
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,480
I feel like I'm pretty ganky, but.

746
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:05,000
But I, I also maybe not.

747
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,480
I'm maybe not the most gankiest.

748
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:09,880
Super ganky.

749
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,120
Mary says we're free to use the car in the garage.

750
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,600
The garage is attached from the mansion.

751
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:24,680
The vintage model van in bicycles only sent the elegant interior.

752
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,000
Thank God for careless people.

753
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
The car key was left in the table.

754
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:34,520
Time to go.

755
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:36,760
Uh, hey.

756
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,280
According to Mary, you lost a bunch of your memories, right?

757
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,400
Is it okay for you to drive?

758
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,200
She looks at me suspiciously.

759
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,000
Don't worry, it'll be fine, I think.

760
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,280
I'll come back when I take the wheel.

761
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,920
Part of that is to convince myself.

762
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,200
Well, aren't you missing your license?

763
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,880
If a cop finds us, we'll have more to worry about than Hanahiko.

764
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,520
She's right about that.

765
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,800
But I have a license.

766
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,840
But this is not me, this is Senpai.

767
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,000
Senpai, do you have a license?

768
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,680
But our lives are on the line, so we don't have much of a choice.

769
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,240
Okay, okay, okay.

770
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:42,600
Then we're safe if, if more than, if a good, if a handful of Senpais can drive, will survive.

771
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

772
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,000
Once the mark's gone, I'll remember.

773
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,640
I'm surprised that a lot of you don't have a driver's license, actually.

774
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:12,440
Then I'll probably just have them reissue it, assuming I ever got one.

775
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,200
Oh, now I'm even more worried.

776
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,360
Just drive safe, okay?

777
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,160
Let's head to H. elementary.

778
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,160
Hoteru.

779
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,080
Human bodies are remarkable.

780
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,880
Back in the garage, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to drive or not.

781
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,880
But the second my hand touched the wheel, I wasn't worried anymore.

782
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,880
I must have reacted quicker than I expected.

783
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:58,760
And now, it's now easy to guide this monster down the road.

784
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:06,840
Now, thoughts of what I can no longer do start to filter in my head.

785
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,080
Hey, mister.

786
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,440
Moe pipes up hesitantly.

787
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,720
I should have put more.

788
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,200
I put too much ganky in that.

789
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,920
I'd probably let the silence go on too long.

790
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,440
It doesn't seem as cheerful as she was a little while ago.

791
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,680
What's it like to lose your memories?

792
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,360
That's a hard question to answer.

793
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,160
What do you mean?

794
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,560
Like, do they all go at once?

795
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,240
Or a few pieces at a time?

796
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,520
I can't believe I'm just like, just like, hey, mister.

797
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,920
She said, hesitantly, hey, mister.

798
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:09,800
Tea.

799
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,000
What if you're only left with sad memories?

800
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,360
I'd hate that.

801
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:30,040
I don't think it works like that, but I have no idea if it's getting worse or better.

802
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,040
I don't know what I was like to begin with, so there's nothing to compare to.

803
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,280
In that sense, rather than the memories vanishing,

804
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,720
like everything's been painted white, but it feels like.

805
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:53,640
Oh, you sure I'm mature, mister?

806
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,960
Take everything so calmly.

807
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, senpais do not paint it white.

808
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

809
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,680
We are facing.

810
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,720
We are facing some ghosts right now.

811
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:24,200
The conversation dwindles, leaving only the sound of the tires on the road.

812
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,920
Then thoughts start popping into my head again, one after another.

813
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,240
I know we have to check out that mirror.

814
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,680
What else should we investigate?

815
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,320
What do you think?

816
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,880
The white glance is over it.

817
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:43,880
No idea.

818
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,320
I can't even remember my own name.

819
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:53,240
How the hell am I supposed to know what we're doing?

820
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,960
Oh, please.

821
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,240
I'm really counting on you.

822
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,400
Think about everything.

823
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,600
I'm talking to a child.

824
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,000
I need to show restraint and be a good example.

825
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,680
But that's definitely how I really feel.

826
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,560
Mercy, this girl is kind of clingy.

827
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,080
She's just a kid.

828
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,920
I'm pretty clingy.

829
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,920
Do you have problems with that, senpai?

830
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,520
I stare down the steering wheel.

831
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,000
Ah, flashbang.

832
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,320
No, no problem.

833
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,680
Not only Mercy, it's okay.

834
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,280
Also, your coral if it's a kid, gotcha.

835
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,080
What are you implying, senpai?

836
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:05,080
I'm saying that you would not have any interest in kids, right?

837
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:06,680
Senpai?

838
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,640
Amy and Icy don't count.

839
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,240
They don't count.

840
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,400
No, they don't count.

841
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,680
No, they don't count.

842
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:51,640
Amy is immortal, and I don't know how old Icy is in bear,

843
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:56,760
but bear, but old enough in human years.

844
01:28:58,680 --> 01:28:59,000
Okay.

845
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:08,200
You're not interested in high schoolers, right, senpai?

846
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,680
Except for me, right?

847
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,040
An adult who's sort of role-playing a high schooler.

848
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,920
I know I'm a college.

849
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:30,920
I'm college.

850
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:32,920
Wait, I'm college.

851
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,480
I'm college.

852
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,440
I made a mistake.

853
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,600
I just like high school uniforms.

854
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:52,920
Listen, they don't wear sayfuku in university.

855
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,760
This is just aesthetics.

856
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,120
This is just aesthetics.

857
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,520
This is just aesthetics.

858
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,400
Shut the fuck up.

859
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,400
Memory loss beam.

860
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,920
You will forget that I made a fucking lucky boo.

861
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,280
Let's continue the game.

862
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,080
Yeah.

863
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:37,800
Who's that doll here?

864
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,400
Oh, yeah, let's do the game.

865
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,120
A doll in the mansion.

866
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,000
Markbearers.

867
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:05,800
Yo, senpai, you forgot.

868
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,600
You dozed off a little.

869
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,280
We're playing death mark, remember?

870
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,120
The mark spirits.

871
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,520
And the mysterious deaths.

872
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:37,560
Can't remember, must be the mark.

873
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,480
Oh, no, we should go exercise these spirits.

874
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,640
Yeah, it's okay.

875
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,720
It's okay if senpai is passed out.

876
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,560
I'm always taking care of senpai.

877
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,600
Also, yeah, senpai has been in a loving relationship with me for a long time,

878
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,200
and we're going to have three kids, okay?

879
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,880
Feel like I'm going to be buried

880
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,680
under all the crushing thoughts that keep popping into my mind.

881
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,480
I think three is a good number.

882
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,400
I think three per senpai is a good number.

883
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:40,120
What awaits me down the dark road?

884
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,200
I actually, to be honest, I don't know.

885
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:51,640
What I'm saying?

886
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,360
I think actually three kids in total is fine.

887
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:08,280
Okay, yeah, it's been a long week.

888
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,440
I've been, I've been just saying shit.

889
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:25,640
I feel a flutter, flutter, flutter, and mark on my wrist like it's trying to warn me.

890
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:34,440
My brain might not be able to understand, but my body can sense it.

891
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,240
That death is closing in.

892
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,040
You want daughters or son more?

893
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:45,000
Um, I don't know.

894
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,920
I feel like daughters are cuter,

895
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,280
but like, I wouldn't mind a son either.

896
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,680
Anyways, it doesn't matter.

897
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,120
I'll love them no matter what.

898
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,920
If that's happening, isn't the problem.

899
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,560
It's more how long do I have left?

900
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,080
How much, how much longer is it?

901
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,640
I almost yell, but I managed to swallow it down with effort.

902
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,960
I think we're almost there.

903
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:33,480
Even if our kids are worms, even if you are a worm, Senpai, I would still love you.

904
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:39,880
Really?

905
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,280
Really?

906
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,400
It's closer than I thought.

907
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,800
Yeah, yeah, exactly right.

908
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:50,360
Or at any time it could

909
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:56,040
It's a lot closer than you think.

910
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:10,280
Looming ominously in the moonlight, the school definitely looks abandoned.

911
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:14,920
For quite a number of years, in fact, these walls are starting to crack.

912
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,400
All the windows are broken as well.

913
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,960
A thick chain is in front of the main gate to keep people from going in.

914
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,120
Hey, you there, not another step.

915
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,960
An enthusiastic voice comes from a man in a guard uniform.

916
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,560
You must be patrolling the area like we got caught.

917
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,720
This property belongs to the city.

918
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,480
No one's allowed in, didn't you know?

919
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:46,680
Or are you up to something?

920
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,160
A bunch of people have been coming here on dares since it's haunted.

921
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,160
You aren't one of them, are you?

922
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:57,640
It's haunted?

923
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,880
Oh, give me a second.

924
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,400
Um, it's haunted?

925
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

926
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,040
Damn, is it haunted?

927
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,160
Oh, that's what the rumors are saying anyway.

928
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,040
It's just a great pain.

929
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:14,840
Oh, he nods in agreement.

930
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,600
It is pretty famous after all.

931
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,680
The guard sighs.

932
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,080
Anyway, the school is off limits, so you can't go inside.

933
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,680
I don't want any trouble on my first shift here.

934
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,240
Please leave.

935
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:33,800
You know.

936
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:34,680
Okay.

937
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,240
You know.

938
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:40,840
I'm muttering to himself.

939
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,680
The guard makes his way into the school.

940
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:49,480
As we watch him leave, Moe leans over and whispers.

941
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,480
Damn, it wasn't a guard when I stuck in here before.

942
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,480
I did not get caught.

943
01:36:58,840 --> 01:36:59,960
Moving around a haunt.

944
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,320
Use the...

945
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,040
Lease keys to move.

946
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,640
The map shows which way you're facing and where you can go.

947
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:10,280
All right.

948
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:13,720
Let's go.

949
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:15,900
Oh.

950
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,240
Pushing open the doors I head inside.

951
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,840
Oh, it's so dark.

952
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,160
I can't see anything like this.

953
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,200
The moonlight doesn't reach inside.

954
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,720
We'll have to use the flashlight.

955
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:33,880
But if we use the flashlight, that guard will find us.

956
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,760
And do anything about it, I guess.

957
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,680
Anyway, that mirror is...

958
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,280
I'm pretty sure it's on the right.

959
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,280
To the right on the staircase.

960
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:45,980
Okay.

961
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,120
Instagating a haunt.

962
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,840
Move the L to search the current area.

963
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,800
Shine the flashlight in areas of interest and press A.

964
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,680
Pressing B ends the search.

965
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,920
Using the pad.

966
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,640
The search and move.

967
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,520
Um, look.

968
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:17,480
Do not leave hand prints in the mirror in the eastern staircase.

969
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:17,880
Thank you.

970
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,360
Independent research presentation.

971
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,160
First floor.

972
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,280
Multi-purpose classroom.

973
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,000
Come check it out.

974
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,960
Wow, that presentation takes me back.

975
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,520
Anyway, the mirror is on the eastern staircase.

976
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:31,320
It's the one I saw.

977
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,360
Guess we'll go there first.

978
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:36,360
Yeah, it's to the right.

979
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,840
Let me investigate, bish.

980
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,200
Yo, I turn over the torn flyer.

981
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:45,640
And I don't find anything in particular.

982
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,680
Nothing's there, huh?

983
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:51,880
Nothing's there, huh?

984
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:52,520
Looks like it.

985
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,180
Cool.

986
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,280
Um, and...

987
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,560
Anything else?

988
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:03,880
Ooh!

989
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:10,360
There are platforms of broken wooden slats in front of this true rock.

990
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,200
They creak when we step on them.

991
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:13,960
Record?

992
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:18,920
Uh...

993
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:23,640
Oh, that's one.

994
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:25,960
Half torn poster.

995
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:30,280
Says lost and found in large letters at the top.

996
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,000
Look, lost items are kept in the storage in the staff room.

997
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,000
Please check if you're missing something.

998
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,480
Deal.

999
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,000
Touch the paper.

1000
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:39,880
It disintegrates.

1001
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:43,800
Second, my fingers reach it and scatters through the air.

1002
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,800
Nothing else looks interesting.

1003
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:52,040
Okay, anything else we can look at?

1004
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:57,480
The ceiling is filthy and the fluorescent lights are broken.

1005
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,000
All right, I think that's it.

1006
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,040
Went to the right.

1007
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:07,420
Huh?

1008
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:16,200
As we enter the hallway, a small shadow flits across our feet.

1009
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:19,800
Turn the flashlight and find.

1010
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,680
Huh? A bunny!

1011
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,480
It's so cute!

1012
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:28,860
Huh.

1013
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:31,560
A bunny!

1014
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:37,720
What's... is it the school pet?

1015
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,320
Uh, how long has the school been closed for?

1016
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,200
I don't think so.

1017
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,360
I don't think so.

1018
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:45,720
I don't think the banyoumi's there.

1019
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:50,360
Chibi's more of a blonde bunny.

1020
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,560
Is the bunny from Ghost Stories?

1021
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:55,720
Touch me.

1022
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:56,520
Touch me harder.

1023
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:08,840
The black rabbit squeaks and runs away.

1024
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:12,040
It rushes towards the eastern end of the school.

1025
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,280
Ah, I ran away.

1026
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,560
Is it telling us to follow?

1027
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:19,320
Haha, you're right.

1028
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,080
New info was added to the spirit file.

1029
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:23,720
Black rabbit.

1030
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:28,920
Uh, spooky.

1031
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:32,360
It looks like something smashed the fluorescent lights.

1032
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,200
Their shadowed beyond repair.

1033
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,600
Should we go into the classroom?

1034
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:49,480
I'm gonna do it.

1035
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:52,600
Maybe we can find something cool.

1036
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:57,080
It's abandoned desk.

1037
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,280
On desk is slightly rusty.

1038
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,600
Turn the desk around and stick my hand inside.

1039
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,040
Got a holy, holy hard hat.

1040
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,840
I doubt that's very useful.

1041
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,120
I doubt that's very useful.

1042
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:13,560
You never know.

1043
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,400
The dust is thick on the ceiling.

1044
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:20,520
That just walking around causes a shower of particles.

1045
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,760
I think that's it in this room.

1046
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:29,640
I can't.

1047
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:42,440
Moved forward.

1048
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:45,960
Down here.

1049
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:47,560
Seems to be locked.

1050
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:54,280
Broken window is letting in a piercingly cold wind.

1051
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,560
The door is locked.

1052
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,080
Locked door.

1053
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,280
I wonder if we could wrench it open by sticking the letter opening into the hole.

1054
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,400
Give it a try, but it won't even fit inside.

1055
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,720
Wow, so uncool.

1056
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:25,400
Put the fuck up!

1057
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,200
The floor tile is upheeled off, leaving bare concrete.

1058
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,760
I wonder if I can just peel around.

1059
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:37,960
Keyhole isn't rusted over.

1060
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,240
If I had a key, I could open it.

1061
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,040
Okay.

1062
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:50,040
What platform did you first play this on, Mercy?

1063
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:50,840
Um...

1064
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:53,720
PS4.

1065
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:55,800
I think.

1066
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,080
The fire door is rusted shut and won't move.

1067
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:04,840
Hi.

1068
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,760
Shut the fuck up!

1069
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,000
That's my job!

1070
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,160
Climb the stairs.

1071
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,200
Don't copy me stinking.

1072
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:33,480
Stinking ghost.

1073
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,120
This is it.

1074
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:42,840
The mirror I saw last time, I'm sure of it.

1075
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:44,520
Huh?

1076
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:48,520
Just then a dull pain runs through my wrists.

1077
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,600
Like something is biting into my skin.

1078
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,000
To distract myself from the pain.

1079
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,240
I keep talking with Moe.

1080
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,560
Certainly looks normal.

1081
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,320
Yeah, what should we do?

1082
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,240
I feel like I should save.

1083
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:27,160
I suddenly face the mirror, bringing my face up to it.

1084
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,840
Into its cloudy surface.

1085
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,520
As expected, I can't make anything else.

1086
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,680
I see my own shadow reflected as a vague shadowy lump.

1087
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,240
Shadow sways in the mirror.

1088
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,720
At least that's what I thought at first.

1089
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,800
I figured the shadow moved because I had.

1090
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:48,680
The next time the shadow moves, a cold shiver runs down my spine.

1091
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,520
That's not my shadow.

1092
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,760
Okay, okay, you remember the story of Hanahiko, right?

1093
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:07,960
We say no, you're not pretty, and we are not an adult.

1094
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,160
Some things in the mirror.

1095
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:21,480
Sorry, I'm going to try to do a Moe.

1096
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:25,800
Moe yelps and steps back.

1097
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,440
That confirms I'm not hallucinating.

1098
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,640
There really is something in there.

1099
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,440
Every muscle in my body locks.

1100
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,160
Try to look away, but I can't even close my eyes.

1101
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,400
Figure's mouth twists.

1102
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,920
I don't know look, but I can't even close my eyes.

1103
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,480
It opens his mouth.

1104
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:49,880
An unvoiced pierces my ears.

1105
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:55,000
Live or die.

1106
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,120
Hey, am I pretty?

1107
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,480
No, no, right?

1108
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:12,200
Yes, safe!

1109
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:20,680
Only I had that red stuff.

1110
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:23,960
Can't see well.

1111
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,400
You a grown-up?

1112
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,880
No, no, I'm not a grown-up.

1113
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:28,360
Uh-uh.

1114
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,960
I'm the tallest in my class.

1115
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:45,640
Big people aren't allowed in school.

1116
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:50,840
Suddenly the mirror cracks.

1117
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:54,440
I'm just, I was just pretty tall.

1118
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:58,680
Actually, oh no, no, no, I'm not going to tell the story.

1119
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,800
I'm not going to tell the story because my senpais will make fun of me.

1120
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:08,520
Suddenly the mirror cracks.

1121
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,640
Big crack now.

1122
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:18,680
I can't see no more big people here.

1123
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:22,920
We would never.

1124
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:28,200
Okay, so you know how I'm five, five, three in freedom units, right?

1125
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:29,640
Okay, fine.

1126
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:30,520
I'll tell the story.

1127
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:41,480
So I stopped growing around fifth grade.

1128
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,640
And I was the tallest in my class.

1129
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:50,280
And I was so happy.

1130
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:53,400
And then the following year, everyone shot way past me.

1131
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:56,040
And I was like, oh, okay.

1132
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:09,240
A brief fleeting moment of glory.

1133
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,760
I was, I was the tallest.

1134
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:15,880
And then I was not immediately after.

1135
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:22,920
All right, the figure disappears.

1136
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:25,080
Survived.

1137
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:26,460
Whew.

1138
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,000
The scream echoes from the other side of the school.

1139
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:33,960
Moe sinks to the floor.

1140
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:38,200
The gasping panic disbelief for a while.

1141
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,160
I feel much the same.

1142
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:41,480
What was that?

1143
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:45,960
Probably an ahiqo.

1144
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,760
I couldn't say it.

1145
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,160
The words stuck in my throat.

1146
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,000
My mouth is completely dry.

1147
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:55,800
I can't believe this.

1148
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:59,640
I, I thought I wanted to see a ghost.

1149
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,960
But just see one that clearly.

1150
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,840
I got a moment to feel that I was the tallest.

1151
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:24,520
Yeah, hydration check.

1152
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,160
Thank you.

1153
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,120
Wait, are you saying that to Moe?

1154
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:32,600
Well, excuse me.

1155
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,720
What about mercy?

1156
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:44,680
Moe seems to shake the encounter off and return to normal.

1157
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:48,120
An ahiqo's words swirl in my head.

1158
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,040
Our situation has done a complete reverse from where we were just a moment ago.

1159
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:57,080
I can't believe I was complaining about not knowing what to investigate.

1160
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:01,720
Oh, anyway, scream.

1161
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,440
What was that?

1162
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,560
A guard we met outside.

1163
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,640
I'm going to let that pass.

1164
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,520
For now, then bye.

1165
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,560
I doubt there's anyone else here.

1166
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,840
You might have seen something.

1167
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:27,880
Wherever he is too.

1168
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:29,880
Sounded like it came from far away.

1169
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,200
A ways down the hallway.

1170
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,200
Be the other side of the school.

1171
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:37,160
Yeah, let's look for him.

1172
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:38,840
If he screamed like that.

1173
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,000
Something might have happened to him.

1174
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:45,640
Right as I respond, hear someone whisper in my ear.

1175
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:49,960
A pair of eyes.

1176
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:51,560
Hold on.

1177
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,720
A pair of eyes with red.

1178
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:02,440
I look in the direction of the voice, but all I see is darkness.

1179
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:04,200
Mystery?

1180
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:06,760
No, it's nothing.

1181
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:09,480
Let's go.

1182
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:14,120
New info was added to the spirit file.

1183
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:15,640
An ahiqo, the boy in the mirror.

1184
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:25,000
Can I go up here?

1185
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,520
Climbed the stairs.

1186
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,840
Climbed up the stairs to the second floor.

1187
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,720
I guess something soft squished under my heel.

1188
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,800
Could I pick up my foot and shine the light down?

1189
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:43,640
Oh, that's a lot of snacks.

1190
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:44,440
Snacks.

1191
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:47,320
Snacks, snacks.

1192
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:48,360
So many snacks.

1193
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:51,080
Hallways covered with poisonous snakes.

1194
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:53,320
Come on, wait.

1195
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,080
Let's have something close to a streak upon seeing them.

1196
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,800
Eats and snakes!

1197
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,320
Decided to go back to the landing.

1198
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:09,320
Oh, let's go.

1199
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:11,880
Went down the stairs.

1200
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:19,560
I think we looked at these places.

1201
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,760
A bird breaks the silence.

1202
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:26,520
Like there's a crow or something outside.

1203
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,680
Don't spook me now!

1204
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,040
Oh, shut up.

1205
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:54,600
It needs to be locked.

1206
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:08,200
Lights on the ceilings are silent and dark without power.

1207
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:10,600
Entered the left room.

1208
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:14,280
I don't know what that fucking says.

1209
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:20,440
There are nonsense scribbles on the blackboard.

1210
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,360
There's a hole in the wall.

1211
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:29,160
Yeah, stick my arm in, but the hole gets narrow and further I go in and can't reach

1212
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:29,720
what's inside.

1213
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:31,880
Tool.

1214
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:33,080
Fire opener.

1215
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:37,400
Pick the lever opener in the hole and scrape out the item though, second side.

1216
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,200
A worn out talisman.

1217
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:41,880
And I pick up the worn out talisman.

1218
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,560
I feel warmth flow through me.

1219
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,360
Oh, soul power.

1220
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:50,040
A worn out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

1221
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:54,280
Find a worn out talisman to restore your soul power.

1222
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:58,760
The more soul power you have, the easier it will be to survive a deadly choice.

1223
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:03,640
Got an achievement for that.

1224
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:07,240
An abandoned desk.

1225
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:11,000
Yo, stick my hand inside and feel around.

1226
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:12,920
A plastic bottle.

1227
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,240
There's nothing in the bottle.

1228
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,560
Oh, it might come in handy.

1229
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,640
Senpai, are you scared?

1230
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,560
I can't remember which way I'm going.

1231
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:42,520
I hear a noise like something slamming against the door.

1232
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,560
Is someone inside?

1233
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:49,640
And the flashlight at the door.

1234
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:55,560
No, not the security guard.

1235
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,120
Yeah.

1236
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:07,480
I don't know where the door bursts open and something comes flying out.

1237
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:13,960
Moe shrieks and falls down.

1238
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:16,200
I recognize those clothes.

1239
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,200
Some kind of plant covers half his face.

1240
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,160
The part of his face we can see is twisted in anguish as he screams.

1241
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:27,560
No doubt about it, it's that guard.

1242
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,720
How happened?

1243
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:33,320
They're eating my face!

1244
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:38,520
It hurts.

1245
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:39,560
What's going on?

1246
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:42,120
Uh-uh.

1247
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:43,960
I'm sorry.

1248
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:44,440
I'm sorry.

1249
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:44,920
I'm sorry.

1250
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:45,400
I'm sorry.

1251
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:45,960
I'm sorry.

1252
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:46,440
I'm sorry.

1253
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:46,920
I'm sorry.

1254
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:47,400
I'm sorry.

1255
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:47,960
I'm sorry.

1256
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:48,440
I'm sorry.

1257
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:48,920
I'm sorry.

1258
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:49,560
I'm sorry.

1259
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:52,920
Moe sits on the floor, stunned into syllable.

1260
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,680
The guards only rushes towards the entrance.

1261
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:06,600
And then silence falls once more.

1262
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,040
The only sound left is that of her shaky breathing.

1263
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:24,760
Once we catch her breath, take Moe's hand and help them up.

1264
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:30,200
Her nerves have calmed some, but that definitely left an unsettling impression.

1265
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:35,800
Something terrible lurks here.

1266
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:36,680
Can't just sit around.

1267
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,360
I felt like I was paralyzed.

1268
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:43,720
I'm okay now.

1269
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:46,520
Mr. That Guy.

1270
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:49,960
I'm always stares at the door.

1271
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:54,680
I wonder if Anahiko did that.

1272
01:57:57,400 --> 01:58:02,840
And I don't know if you noticed, but I got the feeling someone was standing behind him.

1273
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,600
There's really no good way to respond to that.

1274
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,480
I let silence serve as my answer.

1275
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,040
What else could I do?

1276
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:17,800
No point in coming here for just going to stand here shaking.

1277
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:22,040
Don't uncover the secret before it comes for us.

1278
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:24,680
Let me check out the staff room.

1279
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:28,200
Actually avoid answering Moe's question.

1280
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,920
Guard had run out of here.

1281
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,040
Something might be inside.

1282
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,560
Some secret about Anahiko.

1283
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,120
Yeah, yeah.

1284
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:37,880
You're right.

1285
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,680
Just be careful, okay?

1286
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:45,960
I cover my wrist with my palm, making sure Moe doesn't miss.

1287
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:49,480
The moment I put my hand on the knob,

1288
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:54,360
a mark burned my skin, pulsing along with my beating heart.

1289
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:00,680
New info is added to the spirit file.

1290
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:01,640
Time to fight guard.

1291
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:06,440
All right.

1292
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:09,960
Record?

1293
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:18,040
Let's check the memo out.

1294
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:18,760
Anahiko?

1295
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:23,800
A mysterious backrabbit appeared in front of us out of nowhere.

1296
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:27,000
It's funny, but we've encountered so many strange things already.

1297
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And an odd bunny doesn't faze me at all.

1298
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,640
Though this paralyzing dread might be concerning anyway.

1299
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:33,480
Might be a bit concerning.

1300
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:35,480
Anyway, first we have to find that mirror.

1301
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:38,600
Anahiko with the boy in the mirror.

1302
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:41,320
Like the rumor said, Gassley Boy appeared.

1303
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:44,520
We answered some of his questions, then the mirror broke and he vanished.

1304
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,760
No more big people here, he said.

1305
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:52,200
Like who is chasing something, then we heard a horrible scream.

1306
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,440
Came from the opposite end of the school.

1307
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,800
It sounded familiar.

1308
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:58,920
The mysteries didn't end there.

1309
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,920
I heard a whisper in my ear and said,

1310
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:02,760
Purify with red.

1311
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:05,320
What was that eerie voice?

1312
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:06,760
Maybe something was...

1313
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:08,360
Maybe something was...

1314
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:09,080
That's going on.

1315
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,080
It's making me go crazy.

1316
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:14,760
Regardless, we first need to find the true cause of that scream.

1317
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:18,920
The guard we met at the school gate was the one who screamed.

1318
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:22,840
Burst out of the staff room covered in growing plants of all things.

1319
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:24,920
The pain was driving him mad.

1320
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:26,520
The spirit do this?

1321
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:29,000
It must have been Anahiko.

1322
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:29,560
Which means...

1323
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:34,040
Inside the staff room is what we have to keep going.

1324
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:39,240
Okay, are you ready senpai?

1325
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:42,200
I feel like I'm gonna piss.

1326
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:48,920
The staff room is in chaos.

1327
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:53,480
Furniture is upended and the walls are...

1328
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:56,360
Is there a fire here or something?

1329
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,680
There are black scorch marks everywhere.

1330
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:01,180
Yeah.

1331
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:04,280
Boy, it looks relieved as they come out from behind me.

1332
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,240
Well, totally empty.

1333
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:11,640
Anyway, let's look around.

1334
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:15,880
There's a door here too.

1335
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:17,080
It's like it goes to another room.

1336
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,320
I search the burnt posts.

1337
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:21,320
Something falls from the top of it.

1338
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:23,640
It's bound to Warn out Talisman.

1339
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:26,680
I pick up the Warn out Talisman and feel a warmth flow through me.

1340
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:29,480
Got the soul power.

1341
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,240
Warn out Talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

1342
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:39,400
I think there's nothing else to do.

1343
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,440
I think there's something else.

1344
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:51,440
I think there's nothing else here, just here, walls near the window is burnt, there must

1345
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:55,440
have been a fire here a long time ago.

1346
02:01:55,440 --> 02:02:00,440
Open the door and left the staff room.

1347
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:04,440
I cramped in here.

1348
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:07,440
Is this a storage room?

1349
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,440
Seems?

1350
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:10,440
It seems to be.

1351
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:17,440
Hopefully there's something useful here.

1352
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:21,440
There's a massive wooden cabinet.

1353
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:26,440
It's really old, the corners of the doors are rounded off.

1354
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:28,440
It's all in the door but just rattles in place.

1355
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:30,440
Looks like it will open.

1356
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:35,440
Something's stopping it.

1357
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:37,440
Take out the letter opener.

1358
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:38,440
What do I do with it?

1359
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:44,440
I don't have any particularly good ideas.

1360
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:47,440
Your little shit.

1361
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:52,440
That one actually spooked me a little.

1362
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:54,440
That one actually spooked me a little.

1363
02:02:54,440 --> 02:03:00,440
Oh, I just realized I'm super far away.

1364
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,440
I opened the last door and checked inside.

1365
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:04,440
There isn't anything that catches my eyes.

1366
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:07,440
That actually kind of spooked me a little.

1367
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:13,440
Good thing I did kegels.

1368
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:15,440
Open the last door and check inside.

1369
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,440
But there isn't anything that catches my eye.

1370
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:30,440
I went into super comfy mode and just leaned back.

1371
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:32,440
I think it's a school journal.

1372
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:40,440
The paper deteriorated from ages and bugs so I can't read it.

1373
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:43,440
There's a door cut in the floor.

1374
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:45,440
Is it some kind of storage area?

1375
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,440
A little bit.

1376
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:51,440
Built door big enough to fit an adult through.

1377
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:52,440
Feel?

1378
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:55,440
My little head always retracted into the door.

1379
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:57,440
I had to get a grasp on it and pull it out

1380
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:02,440
but I am unsuccessful.

1381
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,440
Letter opener again.

1382
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:05,440
Easy, letter opener.

1383
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,440
I might be able to pull the handle out.

1384
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,440
Spot down by the door.

1385
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:20,440
My mark bites into my wrists again.

1386
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:25,440
It's almost like it's trying to stop me from searching under the floor.

1387
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:28,440
Stand up pretending to be calm.

1388
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:30,440
Hey, that's worrying.

1389
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:33,440
I think dangerous must be here.

1390
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,440
What's wrong?

1391
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:37,440
Are you going to see what that is?

1392
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:42,440
I'll check it out later.

1393
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:47,440
Keep my reply big as I dust off my knees.

1394
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:50,440
Let's look around the room first.

1395
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:53,440
There's a bunch of interesting stuff in here.

1396
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:54,440
I have nothing.

1397
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:56,440
It's something beneath our feet.

1398
02:04:56,440 --> 02:05:03,440
We better make sure we're prepared for going down there.

1399
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:06,440
Can I shake it more?

1400
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:12,440
I feel it on the door but it just rattles in place.

1401
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:23,440
Look.

1402
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,440
I don't see it anywhere.

1403
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,440
What's this?

1404
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:30,440
Something stuck in the hole for the screw.

1405
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:35,440
Seems that wooden thing works as a lock.

1406
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:38,440
I have to do something about that to open the door.

1407
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:39,440
Seriously?

1408
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:41,440
I used the letter opener before?

1409
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:46,440
I might be able to pop out whatever stuck in the hole.

1410
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:49,440
That's the idea at least.

1411
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,440
I hope it won't fit at all.

1412
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,440
The knife is too big.

1413
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:58,440
What else can I use?

1414
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:01,440
Open the last door and check inside.

1415
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:07,440
There isn't anything that catches my eye.

1416
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,440
Anything else?

1417
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:11,440
Oh, there's a box up there.

1418
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:14,440
That's the cardboard box on top of the cabinet.

1419
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:16,440
I think I can reach it.

1420
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:19,440
Something's written on the marker at the side of the box.

1421
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:24,440
Austin is legible but the rest of the letter smudged.

1422
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:26,440
I feel.

1423
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:29,440
Yep, I grabbed the box and looked inside.

1424
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:33,440
Got lipstick, red pen, and girl slippers.

1425
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:34,440
Good job, mister.

1426
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:37,440
I knew there was a reason you were tall.

1427
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:41,440
Shit.

1428
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,440
Now that means...

1429
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:43,440
Oops!

1430
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,440
That's the wrong thing.

1431
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:48,440
Examined first.

1432
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:49,440
Tools.

1433
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:53,440
Maybe I can use the red pen?

1434
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,440
Take out the red pen.

1435
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:55,440
I used the pen.

1436
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:59,440
I might be able to pop open whatever's inside the hole.

1437
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,440
Wow.

1438
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:09,440
You've got skills.

1439
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,440
Is that surprising?

1440
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:16,440
Well, I need to focus.

1441
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,440
Friendly.

1442
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:21,440
Resistance vanishes and the pen pokes all the way through.

1443
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,440
Hold my hand on the door and slide it open without any issue.

1444
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,440
It's a red tube inside.

1445
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:30,440
Got flair.

1446
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:31,440
A flair?

1447
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,440
What's that for?

1448
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:36,440
I mean, you don't know what a flair is.

1449
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:40,440
Also, the next book I may need to go potty.

1450
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:46,440
It's a signal light for an emergency.

1451
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:49,440
It's a good idea to always have one in your car.

1452
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:51,440
Oh, okay then.

1453
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:56,440
But, Moe, I picked something off the floor.

1454
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,440
The thorn.

1455
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:01,440
As long as my pinky finger.

1456
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:04,440
That's what was in the hole.

1457
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,440
I don't mean time call.

1458
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:07,440
I'm a little nervous.

1459
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:08,440
Not gonna lie.

1460
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:10,440
I'm not gonna lie.

1461
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:13,440
I'm a little nervous.

1462
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:18,440
This is so not a coincidence.

1463
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:20,440
Bet he didn't want anyone to have that.

1464
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:23,440
Put a thorn in the hole.

1465
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:30,440
Is he scared of this?

1466
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:37,440
You both look at the flair again.

1467
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:46,440
Why did you turn off the light?

1468
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:49,440
That wasn't me.

1469
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:53,440
I didn't turn it off, it just went off.

1470
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,440
What was that noise?

1471
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,440
Hey mister, what was that noise?

1472
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:00,440
Shh, be quiet.

1473
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:02,440
Struggling not to yell with my nerves on edge.

1474
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:05,440
I hit the flashlight again and again.

1475
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:07,440
Come on, please.

1476
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:10,440
The batteries were just working.

1477
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:14,440
I feel like I'm performing CPR on this thing.

1478
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:17,440
Finally.

1479
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:21,440
Got it.

1480
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:25,440
Door behind me warps threateningly.

1481
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:33,440
I mark burns and pain.

1482
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,440
Get this already in the room next door.

1483
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:40,440
There's no time and nowhere to run.

1484
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:41,440
Calm down.

1485
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,440
We find a way out of this quickly.

1486
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:44,440
We're running out of time.

1487
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:52,440
We did survive, but got to hurry.

1488
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:54,440
I cut the letter opener and shoved it in.

1489
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:56,440
I might be able to get the handle out this way.

1490
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:59,440
I touched the metal, my mark scored.

1491
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:01,440
Not moving for just a second.

1492
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:04,440
But I have to do this.

1493
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:05,440
Yeah, I got it.

1494
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:08,440
I grabbed the handle and lift up the trapdoor.

1495
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:11,440
I thought a dark hole leads down under the floor.

1496
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:13,440
Get in!

1497
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:15,440
I shove Moe into the hole.

1498
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:22,440
And I slide down into the darkness after them.

1499
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:27,440
Ah!

1500
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:31,440
I fall unexpectedly far, hitting my head.

1501
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:34,440
Hitting my back against something.

1502
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:42,440
Get my teeth to stop myself from yelling.

1503
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:46,440
Something shuffling above my head.

1504
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:52,440
If we had just stayed there just a few more seconds.

1505
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:55,440
I grip my burning wrist with all my might.

1506
02:10:55,440 --> 02:11:02,440
I must endure the pain for now.

1507
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:04,440
I can hear anxious panting.

1508
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:07,440
Moe must be right next to me.

1509
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:12,440
Making so hard, I can see it from the corner of my eye.

1510
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:19,440
I brace myself, expecting the trapdoor to break open any second.

1511
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,440
The shuffling noise.

1512
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:26,440
It only grows distant.

1513
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:29,440
Is it okay now?

1514
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:31,440
Yeah.

1515
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:34,440
I think it's gone.

1516
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:40,440
Suddenly my wrist isn't hurting anymore.

1517
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:44,440
Thank God, I thought we were done for this time.

1518
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:48,440
Anyway, where are we?

1519
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:51,440
Where in the world is this room?

1520
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:55,440
I'm surprised this place exists beneath the school.

1521
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:58,440
Can you turn on the light?

1522
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:00,440
Yeah.

1523
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:07,440
I cautiously press the switch, being careful not to make any noise.

1524
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:11,440
Girls.

1525
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:20,440
The scene captured in the light of the flashlight sends shivers down my spine.

1526
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:28,440
Moe slaps a hand over her mouth.

1527
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:35,440
In a few moments, all we can do is stare in silence.

1528
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:40,440
It's sort of pretty with the flowers, I guess.

1529
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:50,440
A disturbing scene, more horrible than anything I've ever seen before, spread out before us.

1530
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:55,440
Anyone would be shocked by it, especially a kid.

1531
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:58,440
I take a deep breath and look closer.

1532
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:01,440
There's something twisting around the corpse.

1533
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:06,440
It's like some kind of plant vine.

1534
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:11,440
Those roses?

1535
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:17,440
The strangely sharp thorns and the thin red petals.

1536
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:20,440
They appear to be real.

1537
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:27,440
Five roses covering the corpses and carpeting the floor.

1538
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:30,440
My vision suddenly grows dim.

1539
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:36,440
Ahh!

1540
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:42,440
Ahh!

1541
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:46,440
Ahh!

1542
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:49,440
Don't look, Senpai! Don't look! Don't look!

1543
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,440
Don't look!

1544
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:56,440
I know! Don't look!

1545
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:59,440
Don't look, Senpai!

1546
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:08,440
Don't look!

1547
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:17,440
I see a woman's body trapped by roses.

1548
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:26,440
What? What is this?

1549
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:29,440
The tragedy that happened in this room.

1550
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:35,440
Don't look, Senpai!

1551
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:38,440
As if it's all playing out in my head.

1552
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:46,440
I can see it.

1553
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:56,440
Girls? Girlses? What are they doing here?

1554
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:58,440
Did someone plant them?

1555
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:00,440
Okay.

1556
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:03,440
You're safe, Senpai. Senpai.

1557
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:10,440
I think you can look again.

1558
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:16,440
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

1559
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:25,440
Moe's voice brings me back to reality.

1560
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,440
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

1561
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:31,440
Always protecting Senpai. Always protecting Senpai.

1562
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:46,440
No ogling!

1563
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:50,440
Yeah. I can't tell them what I...

1564
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:53,440
I can't tell them that I saw some waking dream.

1565
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:55,440
I scrambled to remember the conversation.

1566
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:59,440
That's right. I saw the rose vines then.

1567
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:01,440
It's got to be it.

1568
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:07,440
It's not like they're just bringing up on their own.

1569
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:10,440
Why would anyone do that?

1570
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:12,440
Did someone decorate the corpse?

1571
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:15,440
Is this for some kind of reason?

1572
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:19,440
Did they die captured by the roses like I saw in the vision?

1573
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,440
Moe screams.

1574
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:28,440
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1575
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:31,440
Something moved. See?

1576
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:36,440
Over there! Back in there!

1577
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:44,440
It's something hiding in here.

1578
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:46,440
Mattress is completely discolored.

1579
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:49,440
It's stained with something that looks like sweat.

1580
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:55,440
Someone must have been living here for a long time, too.

1581
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:59,440
Too old.

1582
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:00,440
Letter opener?

1583
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:02,440
It got the letter opener.

1584
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:05,440
What do I do with it? I don't have any in particular!

1585
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:07,440
Fuck! Do I just feel?

1586
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:10,440
Mattress is oozing dark, dirty water.

1587
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:13,440
Smells like sewage.

1588
02:17:13,440 --> 02:17:17,440
Slide the mattress over and find a plastic sheet underneath it.

1589
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:19,440
Got a vinyl sheet!

1590
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:21,440
Pretty thick.

1591
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:25,440
Was it put there to protect from water damage?

1592
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:27,440
Off of the sheet is pitch black.

1593
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:31,440
At first glance, it looks like it's covered in mold.

1594
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:36,440
I spread it open. It crunches as dark red flakes fall from it.

1595
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:38,440
This is blood.

1596
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:43,440
One endowed knife! I'm just going to point a knife at it!

1597
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:48,440
Can't do anything, but whisper dumbfounded as I stare at the bloodstained sheet.

1598
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:54,440
I think murmurs in my ear as I reply.

1599
02:17:54,440 --> 02:18:03,440
Their blood denies him.

1600
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:05,440
Part of me takes the voice seriously.

1601
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:09,440
I'm clearly hallucinating, but for some reason calms me down.

1602
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:14,440
So in days, I shine the flashlight under the bed.

1603
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:17,440
There it is again! Something's there!

1604
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:20,440
Chloe's voice has gone very shrill.

1605
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:22,440
What happened?

1606
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:25,440
Hey, now. Give me a break.

1607
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:27,440
I'm no monster, you know.

1608
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:30,440
A regular human being.

1609
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:33,440
Who are you?

1610
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:36,440
Wait, I remember you. No, I remember you. I remember you.

1611
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:38,440
I remember you. I remember you.

1612
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:40,440
Nope, I remember you.

1613
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:43,440
I play this far. Yeah. Wait, I remember you.

1614
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:48,440
It's fine. It's fine. Who are you?

1615
02:18:48,440 --> 02:18:52,440
This is why I grabbed the knife.

1616
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:55,440
Something slowly climbs out from under the bed.

1617
02:18:55,440 --> 02:19:00,440
It's a man in a trench coat.

1618
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:06,440
A person? What were you doing under there?

1619
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:09,440
The man looks bored. He scoffs.

1620
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:11,440
The same as you.

1621
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:14,440
And that monster escaped down here.

1622
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:17,440
And you guys came.

1623
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:21,440
The man turns his back to us and jerks his chin.

1624
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:24,440
Anyhow, I was hiding over there.

1625
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:30,440
His answer is believable enough.

1626
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:33,440
But why is he at the school to begin with?

1627
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:37,440
His presence raises a lot of questions.

1628
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:42,440
The man tilts his head a bit and peers at me and snorts.

1629
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:44,440
He seems through me.

1630
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:47,440
You don't look like you believe...

1631
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:49,440
You don't look like you believe me.

1632
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:51,440
I guess that's only natural.

1633
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:54,440
I haven't told you everything either.

1634
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:57,440
I could, but...

1635
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:00,440
The man looks around at his feet.

1636
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:02,440
Better get out of here first.

1637
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:05,440
I shouldn't chat at a crime scene.

1638
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:07,440
I think you're right.

1639
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:11,440
Oh, he seems to feel the same way.

1640
02:20:11,440 --> 02:20:14,440
Let's head back for now.

1641
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:18,440
You have somewhere to go back to? Good.

1642
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:21,440
Then let's get going.

1643
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:23,440
The man puts his hand on the ladder.

1644
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:26,440
He pauses and turns to us.

1645
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:29,440
The name's Satoru Mashita.

1646
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:32,440
I'm an ex-detective.

1647
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:34,440
I forgot to mention that.

1648
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:40,440
The man named Mashita disappears up the ladder.

1649
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:43,440
We follow him back up to the first floor.

1650
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:47,440
But when we emerge, he's not there.

1651
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:50,440
Hey, take a look at this.

1652
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:55,440
Mashita's calling us from down the hallway.

1653
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:58,440
Was it like this when you guys came through?

1654
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:02,440
Oh, he pipes up, voice slightly wobbly.

1655
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:04,440
No, it wasn't.

1656
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:07,440
It wasn't like this at all.

1657
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:14,440
Something's creeping along the hallway.

1658
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:17,440
The rose finds.

1659
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:19,440
Not so.

1660
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:22,440
I didn't see them before either.

1661
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:29,440
Oh, ow!

1662
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:32,440
The mark's color grow more vivid.

1663
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:36,440
Early dawn, a few hours left until death closes in.

1664
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:54,440
Some people naturally put others on guard,

1665
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:57,440
even if there's no particular ill will between them.

1666
02:21:57,440 --> 02:22:01,440
It's exactly the type of person Mashita is.

1667
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:07,440
Oh, you've got nice stuff here.

1668
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:10,440
The moment he climbs in the car, he makes a grab for my bag,

1669
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:13,440
and he starts inspecting all of my stuff.

1670
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:16,440
I wasn't planning on keeping a constant eye on him,

1671
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:19,440
but he's making it very hard not to.

1672
02:22:19,440 --> 02:22:22,440
Oh, he seems like the type to stick her nose in everything,

1673
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:27,440
but he's suspiciously silent as if exhausted.

1674
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:29,440
Are you okay, Moe?

1675
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:33,440
Huh? Oh, yeah, just zoning out, you know?

1676
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:36,440
I'm fine.

1677
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:43,440
He doesn't look fine, but my other passenger is of more concern right now.

1678
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:48,440
So, were you at the school because you were investigating something?

1679
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:54,440
I'm not on the force anymore, just poking around for my own reasons.

1680
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:57,440
Something I wanted to check.

1681
02:22:57,440 --> 02:23:02,440
I don't doubt what he says, but that would mean he entered the school illegally.

1682
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:05,440
What were you?

1683
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:08,440
Let me ask one thing first.

1684
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:13,440
Mashita interrupts my question and points to my arm.

1685
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:17,440
Does that hurt?

1686
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:21,440
It doesn't take him long to spot the mark on my wrist.

1687
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:26,440
Sometimes it hurts the most whenever I'm in danger.

1688
02:23:26,440 --> 02:23:30,440
Huh, is that so?

1689
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:34,440
Mashita leans back in his seat, satisfied.

1690
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:38,440
I was investigating some missing people.

1691
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:41,440
Guess he's responding to my question now.

1692
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:45,440
That school came up with a number of missing persons cases.

1693
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:50,440
Each one had some affiliation with age elementary before they disappeared.

1694
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:54,440
Teachers, workers, people in the BTA, students and their family members.

1695
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:56,440
I was looking for them.

1696
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:59,440
Then...

1697
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:02,440
Moe speaks up from the back seat.

1698
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:04,440
Are those people?

1699
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:07,440
The corpses down there?

1700
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:10,440
Doesn't sound as energetic as she usually did.

1701
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:13,440
Does something happen after all?

1702
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:15,440
Is her mark?

1703
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:17,440
Mashita doesn't reply.

1704
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:22,440
Maybe he thinks the answer is obvious, or maybe replying to a kid isn't worth his time.

1705
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:25,440
Something bugs me about what he just said.

1706
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:28,440
The school was clearly suspicious then.

1707
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:31,440
Of course, I brought it up to my superiors.

1708
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:34,440
All I got for it was...

1709
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:40,440
Continues before I can ask, making a slashing motion across his neck.

1710
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:43,440
You got fired, huh?

1711
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:51,440
Disciplinary discharge, something about sexually harassing us, so burden it!

1712
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:59,440
That principal's gotta get some kind of pull, gotta have some kind of political pull.

1713
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:05,440
I probably dug up something he didn't want to get out.

1714
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:11,440
That wasn't my plan, I never meant to uncover anything dirty.

1715
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:15,440
True, the school did have that suspicious room.

1716
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:20,440
Not that strange to think it would come up in some missing persons cases.

1717
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:23,440
That would be common sense at least.

1718
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:27,440
Common sense is for the world of the living.

1719
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:34,440
The spirit might have something to do with those cases.

1720
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:38,440
There's an awkward silence.

1721
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:43,440
In that sense, this isn't even a case anymore, is it?

1722
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:46,440
I should just size deeply.

1723
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:48,440
I would believe it.

1724
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:51,440
I would believe that there's a monster in that school killing people.

1725
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:54,440
It's personal now.

1726
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:56,440
Our problem.

1727
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:58,440
And we're on our own.

1728
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:01,440
He turns his wrist over and shows it to me.

1729
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:06,440
On his skin is the familiar mark.

1730
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:11,440
Yeah, I sensed it as soon as I saw yours.

1731
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:14,440
I had a feeling this would be a problem.

1732
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:17,440
We're in the same boat, you and I.

1733
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:21,440
He's got good instincts.

1734
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:24,440
We should talk more when we get back.

1735
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:27,440
At Kujo Mansion, there's some...

1736
02:26:27,440 --> 02:26:29,440
Stopped myself from finishing my sentence.

1737
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:32,440
I shouldn't mention that for now.

1738
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:37,440
In any case, once we get back, we'll give you more details.

1739
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:42,440
Yeah, I'm sure they'll help him a bunch.

1740
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:44,440
Yeah, I'll share that to help him a bunch.

1741
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:49,440
Who the fuck said that?

1742
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:53,440
I might as she takes off.

1743
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:54,440
Is that Moe?

1744
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:57,440
So hard when all of them are in the same color.

1745
02:26:57,440 --> 02:27:01,440
Yeah, she did help him a lot.

1746
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:02,440
Help, huh?

1747
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:05,440
You're underestimating me.

1748
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:13,440
Who the do's a pale or an orange?

1749
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:18,440
You think I can tell the difference?

1750
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:22,440
When I got out from the car,

1751
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:24,440
someone's there to keep me.

1752
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:26,440
Welcome back, mister.

1753
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:27,440
You too, Miss Moe.

1754
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:29,440
Well, you're unharmed.

1755
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:32,440
Any clues about the spirit?

1756
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:34,440
What?

1757
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:37,440
So there's others.

1758
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:39,440
This is everyone.

1759
02:27:39,440 --> 02:27:44,440
Huh, what a reliable group you've got.

1760
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:48,440
The sarcasm is practically dripping off his words.

1761
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:51,440
So...

1762
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:56,440
Are you all planning to continue to search for that key or whatever it is?

1763
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:58,440
I don't have anything to go on.

1764
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,440
There's no other choice.

1765
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:02,440
I don't understand you.

1766
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:05,440
The source of the mark is the spirit.

1767
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:11,440
It would be best to destroy the source, don't you think?

1768
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:13,440
What do you mean?

1769
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:18,440
The spirit exists, so all you have to do is kill it.

1770
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:22,440
Are you serious?

1771
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:23,440
Of course he's serious.

1772
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:26,440
He doesn't exactly look like the joking type.

1773
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:30,440
Even if we manage to kill it, will that really make the mark disappear?

1774
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:35,440
When I considered everything Mary's told me, it doesn't look like it would work that way.

1775
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:40,440
Even assuming it did would have a more fundamental problem.

1776
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:42,440
How do you plan to kill it?

1777
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:45,440
I'll figure something out.

1778
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:52,440
If something exists, there's logically a way to destroy it as well.

1779
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:57,440
He claims he can kill the spirit yet he doesn't even know how to do it.

1780
02:28:57,440 --> 02:29:01,440
This is all that confidence come from.

1781
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:05,440
Don't forget, I faced him once already.

1782
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:08,440
If we're seriously thinking of killing him.

1783
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:11,440
Actually there are graphs as well.

1784
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:15,440
A little shit took a shot.

1785
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:20,440
Wow, these are hard to read. Hold on.

1786
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:24,440
The little shit shot some kind of thorn at me from a distance.

1787
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:29,440
Hit me hard enough to stick in concrete. No way to get close to him.

1788
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:32,440
I have to make that a priority.

1789
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:36,440
Mash it up, pull something out of the hue of his shoe and toss it to me.

1790
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:39,440
The thorn curved like a thing.

1791
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:42,440
The only reason I'm still breathing is because I was lucky.

1792
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:49,440
It won't happen next time. We need a plan.

1793
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:52,440
If we head to the entrance, I tell Mashita about Kujo Mansion.

1794
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:54,440
He takes it all in silently.

1795
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:59,440
Even bringing up the talking doll or Saiya Kujo's death doesn't trigger a reaction.

1796
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:03,440
Why is he so unnervingly calm?

1797
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:09,440
Because he's already dealt with the supernatural?

1798
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:13,440
We reach the main hall which is warmly lit.

1799
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:18,440
This is a strange mansion, but for some reason I feel like I've come home.

1800
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:28,440
A climatization is kind of terrifying.

1801
02:30:28,440 --> 02:30:32,440
Welcome back, my darling.

1802
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:36,440
That man is a markbearer too, I see.

1803
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:40,440
Would you make the introductions?

1804
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:46,440
I update Mary on our investigation in the strange way we met Mashita.

1805
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:50,440
The mirror, the underground room full of corpses, the sudden appearance of roses.

1806
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:56,440
I really hate to admit it, but it's clear something supernatural is at work.

1807
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:59,440
And the spirit that is the cause of all of it?

1808
02:30:59,440 --> 02:31:02,440
Hanahiko.

1809
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:07,440
There's no doubt that Hanahiko is the one who put the mark on Mashita's arm too.

1810
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:09,440
But...

1811
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:15,440
Stop flashbanging me!

1812
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:19,440
What kind of chance do we have against a monster that can do that?

1813
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:22,440
Weed killer, okay, you know what?

1814
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:25,440
But are roses weeds?

1815
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:29,440
I don't think so.

1816
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:32,440
Mashita says we should kill him.

1817
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:36,440
Is that even possible?

1818
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:39,440
Hey, darling.

1819
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:41,440
Sorry.

1820
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:44,440
I didn't know who that was, so I was like...

1821
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:45,440
Darling.

1822
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:55,440
Okay, so now it's, hey, darling.

1823
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,440
Oops, I dropped my bopple.

1824
02:31:57,440 --> 02:32:05,440
My little ice rollers.

1825
02:32:05,440 --> 02:32:07,440
My train of thought is interrupted.

1826
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:08,440
I'm sorry.

1827
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:09,440
I'm sorry.

1828
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:11,440
I'm sorry, Senpai.

1829
02:32:11,440 --> 02:32:13,440
My fujiyo mind is racing.

1830
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:18,440
I'm starting to make fan fiction in my head.

1831
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:21,440
But then I remembered our protagonist is Senpai, so now I'm just like,

1832
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:31,440
maybe I should scrap that idea.

1833
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:33,440
My train of thought is interrupted.

1834
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:40,440
Mashita's holding a leather-bound notebook out towards me.

1835
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:45,440
Read this.

1836
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:48,440
I picked it up in that underground room.

1837
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:52,440
It was caught up in a bunch of those rose vines when I found it.

1838
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:55,440
It was pretty hard to get loose.

1839
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:57,440
Did you read it?

1840
02:32:57,440 --> 02:32:59,440
I skimmed through a bit.

1841
02:32:59,440 --> 02:33:07,440
It's got some interesting stuff.

1842
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:08,440
I saw.

1843
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:09,440
That's what he says.

1844
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:12,440
But he's not smiling at all.

1845
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:14,440
It's a shimmer.

1846
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:17,440
A shimmer with a quiet anger.

1847
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:18,440
I was like, shimmer.

1848
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:20,440
No, that's not a shimmer.

1849
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:23,440
Dark red mark staying the cover.

1850
02:33:23,440 --> 02:33:26,440
I have a bad feeling that I flipped through it.

1851
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:33,440
Rose petals fall as they become unstuck from the pages.

1852
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:38,440
The notes within are very detailed.

1853
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:42,440
The author was intelligent and well-written.

1854
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:49,440
Reading through it dawns on me that this was written by H. Elementary's principal.

1855
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:55,440
The austere, meticulous letter on each page tell a ghastly story.

1856
02:33:55,440 --> 02:34:03,440
The skirts of a young, adopted boy's tutoring sessions.

1857
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:06,440
The first note is from five years ago.

1858
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:12,440
It seems the boy adopted by the principal was small and exceedingly cute.

1859
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:15,440
He enjoyed wearing skirts and makeup too.

1860
02:34:15,440 --> 02:34:20,440
I was so denying that they truly suited a dainty red-cheeked boy like him.

1861
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:23,440
But the principal had a hard time accepting such fancies.

1862
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:25,440
Bad habits must be corrected.

1863
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:32,440
Young must be corrected young to promote sound, mental and healthy thought.

1864
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:40,440
So he called it tutoring as a cover for his warped desires.

1865
02:34:40,440 --> 02:34:43,440
They took place in the underground room.

1866
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:46,440
Too many prying eyes anywhere else.

1867
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:50,440
There was no safer place than the school at night.

1868
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:54,440
Once all the teachers had left.

1869
02:34:54,440 --> 02:35:01,440
No! No!

1870
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:08,440
The principal stayed behind under the pretense of keeping watch, then tutored.

1871
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:11,440
He was a highly respected teacher.

1872
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:14,440
He even made appearances on TV.

1873
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:19,440
There's no reason to be suspicious.

1874
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:26,440
The only one who noticed anything strange was the boy's homeroom teacher.

1875
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:37,440
But she feared the principal's power and firmly kept her mouth shut.

1876
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:41,440
As the notes continue, they are more and more deranged.

1877
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,440
They paint a horrible picture.

1878
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:48,440
It is of a totally distorted parent and child.

1879
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:51,440
My child gets weaker after every session.

1880
02:35:51,440 --> 02:35:55,440
His delicate frame has grown thinner and his red cheeks are now darkened.

1881
02:35:55,440 --> 02:35:58,440
His appearance is described in detail.

1882
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:00,440
There is no malice or hatred.

1883
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:10,440
It's just fanatical sincerity is pride as an educator.

1884
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:16,440
And a terrifying smothering love.

1885
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:20,440
I don't like where this is going!

1886
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:25,440
It continues like that to the very last page.

1887
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:28,440
There's no mention of what became of the principal and the boy.

1888
02:36:28,440 --> 02:36:34,440
Going by the current state of H elementary, I can hazard a guess.

1889
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:38,440
You don't look so well, mister.

1890
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:40,440
I was in the notebook.

1891
02:36:40,440 --> 02:36:42,440
The cast up here is up at me.

1892
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:46,440
He and the boy in the notebook are about the same age.

1893
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:48,440
This is the stuff you share with the kid.

1894
02:36:48,440 --> 02:36:53,440
I better just sum up the main points for him.

1895
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:55,440
That's terrible.

1896
02:36:55,440 --> 02:36:58,440
Each children are always the victims of eagles of adults.

1897
02:36:58,440 --> 02:37:01,440
Stupid grown ups are irredeemable!

1898
02:37:01,440 --> 02:37:03,440
Okay, chill!

1899
02:37:03,440 --> 02:37:05,440
Chill, kid!

1900
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:12,440
Why do you say that makes sense?

1901
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:14,440
Yeah, but kid, chill!

1902
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:16,440
I know!

1903
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:19,440
I know!

1904
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:29,440
The revolting evil of adults and the poor boy who became a victim.

1905
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:32,440
But is that really the end?

1906
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:35,440
If Hanahiko and the boy in the notebook are connected,

1907
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:42,440
and the boy turned into a monster, is that even possible?

1908
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:44,440
I'm like, yeah, I get it!

1909
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:45,440
I get it, kid!

1910
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:54,440
I get it, just chill, chill!

1911
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:58,440
Untimely deaths produce hatred.

1912
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:01,440
Death does not bring it to an end.

1913
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:08,440
Such festering sentiments can give birth to the supernatural.

1914
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:14,440
Monsters, ghosts, vengeful spirits, they have many names.

1915
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:20,440
I believe that you have all heard one or two such stories.

1916
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:23,440
And an eagle is similar.

1917
02:38:23,440 --> 02:38:26,440
Mary's words are hard to swallow.

1918
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:31,440
After all those weird events, it only makes sense to accept them.

1919
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:40,440
If I turn my back to the truth, all that will await me is death.

1920
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:43,440
And who's talking?

1921
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:46,440
And Hanahiko is really a monster.

1922
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:50,440
Yeah, you must form a plan based off of that hypothesis.

1923
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:54,440
Who's talking?

1924
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:56,440
Mary is silent a moment.

1925
02:38:56,440 --> 02:39:02,440
Then her jade glass eyes shift to Mashita.

1926
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:08,440
Incidentally, according to Lord Darling's report,

1927
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:13,440
there are those amongst you who are considered killing the spirit.

1928
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:19,440
Wait, what the fuck is talking?

1929
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:23,440
There are those among you who are considering killing the spirit.

1930
02:39:23,440 --> 02:39:26,440
I shall warn you just in case.

1931
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:30,440
That would be very difficult to do.

1932
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:34,440
Why is that?

1933
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:40,440
I could see Mashita in Nero's eyes, but I made sure to speak up first.

1934
02:39:40,440 --> 02:39:44,440
They are from the world of the dead.

1935
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:47,440
Just as the living cannot become more alive,

1936
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:49,440
the dead cannot be killed.

1937
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:55,440
The only thing that could possibly destroy is the cursed sentiment.

1938
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:59,440
So what does that mean?

1939
02:39:59,440 --> 02:40:05,440
It's as I told you before, death and life existing together.

1940
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:13,440
If that is the origin of the mark, no way to erase it will be there.

1941
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:21,440
I swear they need to add name plates to someone because I don't know who's talking sometimes.

1942
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:28,440
By driving away the spirit, the curse will also be eliminated.

1943
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:33,440
So defeating Hena Hiko is how we'll be able to destroy the mark.

1944
02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:39,440
Setting aside how he can't be killed, what exactly is the key then?

1945
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:42,440
There's nothing more than a concept.

1946
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:47,440
I am unsure, but I am certain of one thing.

1947
02:40:47,440 --> 02:40:51,440
Fate ties the spirit to its place of birth.

1948
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:57,440
An object there may be able to fill the role of the key.

1949
02:40:57,440 --> 02:41:02,440
It's a difficult concept to grasp, but that is just how spirits are.

1950
02:41:02,440 --> 02:41:08,440
Determining the nature of the key, that would aside your fate.

1951
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:15,440
I had a feeling we'll have to keep digging around each elementary.

1952
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:19,440
We don't know what cursed sentiments or the key is destroying the grudge.

1953
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:26,440
We don't know what the cursed sentiments or the key to destroying the grudges are.

1954
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:31,440
Gaining the key and lifting the grudge is the only way to survive.

1955
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:37,440
It would be required to be callous to make use of the spirit's fear.

1956
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:41,440
The way to repel the spirit lies within its grudge.

1957
02:41:41,440 --> 02:41:48,440
Remember this, and be careful, and be careful.

1958
02:41:48,440 --> 02:41:55,440
New info was added to the spirit file, the secret of the underground room.

1959
02:41:55,440 --> 02:42:02,440
I think Senpai, is this a good place to save?

1960
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:14,440
Because I know we didn't get too far in this visual novel, but I'm a little tired.

1961
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:18,440
I'm a little tired.

1962
02:42:18,440 --> 02:42:24,440
It's been a long day, Senpai.

1963
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:29,440
Mm-mm.

1964
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:37,440
Oops.

1965
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:40,440
I don't remember.

1966
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:47,440
I can go yet and it's here.

1967
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:51,440
Ugh.

1968
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:57,440
I'm so sleepy.

1969
02:42:57,440 --> 02:43:01,440
Yeah, I wanna leave a-

1970
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:09,440
I wanna leave the game.

1971
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:15,440
Wah!

1972
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:18,440
I hope to get the best sleep.

1973
02:43:18,440 --> 02:43:20,440
Senpai, I will.

1974
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:25,440
Also, Senpai was very good and didn't look.

1975
02:43:25,440 --> 02:43:35,440
You kept yourself pure.

1976
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:43,440
I'd like to review next week's...

1977
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:46,440
Next week's...

1978
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:54,440
So tomorrow, when I said I was slowing down, that was a total lie for this week,

1979
02:43:54,440 --> 02:44:01,440
so I checked the following week is when I go to three streams.

1980
02:44:01,440 --> 02:44:05,440
Instead, next week is also five streams.

1981
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:06,440
It's five streams.

1982
02:44:06,440 --> 02:44:10,440
It's not an entire week, so I'm not fully exhausted.

1983
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:14,440
But tomorrow, we're back here again.

1984
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:18,440
What terrible life advice!

1985
02:44:18,440 --> 02:44:22,440
Give me your life, give me your questions through morals.

1986
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:24,440
Or ask them in chat.

1987
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:30,440
Mostly, I would mostly appreciate it if you asked them through morals.

1988
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:34,440
By morals, I mean marshmallows.

1989
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:39,440
Scroll down.

1990
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:41,440
Go down.

1991
02:44:41,440 --> 02:44:51,440
And ask questions about or send me your questions.

1992
02:44:51,440 --> 02:44:56,440
And I will give you the answers that you need.

1993
02:44:56,440 --> 02:44:59,440
Is it going to be good answers?

1994
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:01,440
Probably not.

1995
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:03,440
Is it answers?

1996
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:06,440
Yeah, actually, it's gonna be answers.

1997
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:09,440
What do marshmallows do you get a day?

1998
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:18,440
It really depends.

1999
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:33,440
Sometimes, I have...

2000
02:45:33,440 --> 02:45:39,440
I get lots of morals, and sometimes, I get not too many morals.

2001
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:46,440
And then, some days, I'm like...

2002
02:45:46,440 --> 02:45:51,440
And then, some days, it's just not very nice morals.

2003
02:45:51,440 --> 02:45:56,440
And I'm just like, oh, whatever.

2004
02:45:56,440 --> 02:46:02,440
Between one to a lot, a few?

2005
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:17,440
A few, I guess?

2006
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:26,440
A few, I guess, so...

2007
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:33,440
Right now, I probably have about 200 morals I have to go through.

2008
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:39,440
Some of them I don't really answer, because I'm just like taking them to heart, and I'm just like, thank you.

2009
02:46:39,440 --> 02:46:47,440
Although, I should probably give them hearts, because I haven't been doing that.

2010
02:46:47,440 --> 02:46:55,440
I have around 200 morals, plus...

2011
02:46:55,440 --> 02:47:00,440
Yeah, so...

2012
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:05,440
Yeah, we've been getting a lot of morals.

2013
02:47:05,440 --> 02:47:12,440
A lot of them, I feel bad if I repeat them.

2014
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:22,440
But I should probably start hearting some morals to let some pies know that I've read them.

2015
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:30,440
So I think, yeah, that's pretty, yeah.

2016
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:32,440
That's a lot of morals.

2017
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:37,440
I don't answer it as much as my senpai, not my senpai story, my genmais.

2018
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:43,440
Wow, I'm mixing you up, senpai on the mind, senpai brain rot.

2019
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:47,440
That...

2020
02:47:47,440 --> 02:47:55,440
I'm not as active, because I'm kind of awkward, and I don't know what to reply.

2021
02:47:55,440 --> 02:48:04,440
And if I feel like I just say, oh, thank you, senpai, or wow, that was really hot senpai, I feel like...

2022
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:07,440
I feel like it's not a good enough response.

2023
02:48:07,440 --> 02:48:12,440
So then I don't answer, and then I feel worse.

2024
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:15,440
Don't put your genmates in the basement.

2025
02:48:15,440 --> 02:48:19,440
I'm a steak.

2026
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:21,440
I think they're fine, I can recognize them.

2027
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:26,440
I'll be like, I'll lift up, I'll be like, oh, you don't go there.

2028
02:48:26,440 --> 02:48:36,440
He shone the forehead.

2029
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:39,440
Yeah, likewise I never know what to write for similar reasons.

2030
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:43,440
I don't know what to say.

2031
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:50,440
Otherwise, other than, thank you for supporting me.

2032
02:48:50,440 --> 02:48:54,440
I'm kind of stupid.

2033
02:48:54,440 --> 02:49:00,440
But yeah, tomorrow will be terrible life advice plush marshmallow Q&A.

2034
02:49:00,440 --> 02:49:05,440
I can fully say that I'm not really prepared for it, so I can just...

2035
02:49:05,440 --> 02:49:11,440
It's probably going to be just saying, saying stuff.

2036
02:49:11,440 --> 02:49:17,440
And maybe mixed in with the terrible life advice is some actual life advice.

2037
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:19,440
Who knows?

2038
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:26,440
Going in.

2039
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:29,440
And then I get a day off.

2040
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:36,440
But luckily on that day off, I think my second audio for Patreon is released.

2041
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:43,440
So you can have that in my stead.

2042
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:48,440
Then I'm continuing Omari.

2043
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:54,440
And then I'm doing Power Wash Simulator, which is my first collab.

2044
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:58,440
No wait, technically my second collab with my genmates.

2045
02:49:58,440 --> 02:50:00,440
And then after that is Zatsu Yapping.

2046
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:02,440
So I just yapp about whatever.

2047
02:50:02,440 --> 02:50:08,440
Probably updates saying...

2048
02:50:08,440 --> 02:50:19,440
Probably updates about how I'm feeling, what's it like to be in VLR so far, etc.

2049
02:50:19,440 --> 02:50:24,440
Then after that, Saturday I have a break.

2050
02:50:24,440 --> 02:50:32,440
Then Sunday I have an unarchived karaoke stream.

2051
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:34,440
So it'll be unarchived.

2052
02:50:34,440 --> 02:50:37,440
I'll be singing, you know, songs.

2053
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:46,440
Maybe not well, but I'll be singing.

2054
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:49,440
So yeah, I hope some friends can tune into that.

2055
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:53,440
Or if you're like, wow, that schedule seems like it sucks.

2056
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:58,440
Don't tune in, just kill.

2057
02:50:58,440 --> 02:51:03,440
And then I'll see you next week, I guess.

2058
02:51:03,440 --> 02:51:05,440
But yeah, I really want to play Harvester again.

2059
02:51:05,440 --> 02:51:09,440
So I'm going to play Harvester and Killer 7 again.

2060
02:51:09,440 --> 02:51:21,440
So I'd really love to see that.

2061
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:23,440
Anyway, you sing is the correct way.

2062
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:25,440
We are a captive audience.

2063
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:28,440
Mercy singing us to us is always welcome.

2064
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:30,440
Don't get the holes.

2065
02:51:30,440 --> 02:51:33,440
Be nice to me, senpai.

2066
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:37,440
It's going to be my first time singing in front of my senpai.

2067
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:47,440
So I think I'll be a little bit more nervous than usual.

2068
02:51:47,440 --> 02:51:53,440
I'll probably be singing songs I'm familiar with and some new songs that I'm just like, yeah.

2069
02:51:53,440 --> 02:52:00,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2070
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:02,440
So, yeah.

2071
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:04,440
That's it for today.

2072
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:06,440
Let me check.

2073
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:08,440
What's going on?

2074
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:13,440
Oh my gosh, Azura is still live?

2075
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:15,440
Give me a second, senpai.

2076
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:27,440
I forget how to do this, but I'm going to figure out how to raid.

2077
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:30,440
I forgot how to do it.

2078
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:39,440
It's always because my gen mates raid into me.

2079
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:42,440
Raid into me and I'm not really the one.

2080
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:43,440
Okay, hold on.

2081
02:52:43,440 --> 02:52:44,440
I think I found it.

2082
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:46,440
I think I found it.

2083
02:52:46,440 --> 02:52:47,440
Please wait for me.

2084
02:52:47,440 --> 02:52:50,440
Okay, senpai.

2085
02:52:50,440 --> 02:52:56,440
What is this?

2086
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:59,440
This?

2087
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:01,440
I found it.

2088
02:53:01,440 --> 02:53:07,440
I found a senpai.

2089
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:23,440
She's live.

2090
02:53:23,440 --> 02:53:24,440
I can redirect.

2091
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:27,440
I can do it.

2092
02:53:27,440 --> 02:53:29,440
Okay, senpai.

2093
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:33,440
It should redirect now and if it doesn't, just go over there, okay?

2094
02:53:33,440 --> 02:53:35,440
I love you, senpai.

2095
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:37,440
See you again tomorrow.

2096
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:40,440
And I'm going to rest up now.

2097
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:41,440
Thank you.

2098
02:53:41,440 --> 02:53:44,440
I'm so sorry that I was so very tired and messing and stumbling on my words.

2099
02:53:44,440 --> 02:53:45,440
I was just...

2100
02:53:45,440 --> 02:53:49,440
I was not there.

2101
02:53:49,440 --> 02:53:51,440
Thank you, senpai.

2102
02:53:51,440 --> 02:53:55,440
And I'll see you again next time.

2103
02:53:55,440 --> 02:53:57,440
Scream for Mercy!

2104
02:53:57,440 --> 02:53:59,440
Bye-bye!

2105
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:01,440
Mwah!
