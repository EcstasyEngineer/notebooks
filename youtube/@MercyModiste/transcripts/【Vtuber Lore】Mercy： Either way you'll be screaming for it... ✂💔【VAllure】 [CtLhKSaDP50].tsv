0	7040	It's always one heartbreak after another.
7040	12160	There are people who just love the drama of relationship, but I don't think anyone specifically
12160	14280	pines for heartbreak.
14280	17520	I mean, I always give my best.
17520	23600	I try to be more than fair as a girlfriend, but sometimes I get nit thinking that somehow
23600	25800	it's all my fault.
25800	29600	I just can't wrap my head around how that could be possible.
29600	34920	There are times like this where I try to think back to the start of my love life, starting
34920	38240	with my first love and first loss.
38240	43680	Maybe try to compare and see where I went wrong this time.
43680	46280	It started back in early college.
46280	50800	I was studying to become a fashion designer if you can believe that.
50800	57320	I wasn't as, well, deliciously brazen in my outfit choices as I am now.
57320	62240	A quiet, much-to-overlook girl who never got invited to parties.
62240	67920	Their loss, though I imagine I had more fun sewing, crafting and anything else a grandma
67920	70040	would do with spare time.
70040	72760	An old soul people would call me.
72760	77440	I was content in my own quiet.
77440	80080	That was until I met my first love.
80080	86320	I don't know what he saw in me, but he was the one to make the first move.
86320	90360	Even before I had the mind addressed to attract the male gaze.
90360	95040	Here I was more of an ominous sheet ghost, whatever the reason.
95040	99400	Here was a man who takes charge where he needs to.
99400	105920	He was a dirty, rabid-looking man who stank a booze and oozed failure and degeneracy.
105920	112000	In retrospect, in our first meeting, he was a bit more pushy than I'm used to nowadays.
112000	116880	It's best to understand that the pillar of a strong relationship is setting up boundaries
116880	120080	and it's best to do it as soon as possible.
120080	125000	Putting your foot down, telling your partner what's what is a risk you have to take.
125000	131160	It was because of that I remembered that I always keep my fabric scissors with me.
131160	137800	When you interact with your partner honestly, if the love is true, they can feel your intent.
137800	141480	That's when the honest, purest part of them comes out.
141480	144480	My favorite stage in all of my relationships.
144480	149960	It was like he was a completely different person from his introduction.
149960	155480	He showed me his true self, a part men are taught to hide away, the soft, sweet, vulnerable
155480	156480	man inside.
156480	160680	I mean, how could I not fall for him?
160680	166000	I don't think I have a particular type per se, but a man who expresses his emotions in
166000	169400	such a delicious way, that's something I couldn't resist.
169400	170560	I just had to have him.
171760	176920	I had brought him to an old shed my family owns, the best I could do at the time, but
176920	179960	together our love can make it a home.
179960	187720	You see, good relationships are built on compromise, and I, and compromise I did.
187720	191560	I gave that man everything, everything he could ever want.
191560	197040	I bathed him, fed him, cared for him, gave myself to him.
197040	200680	The time we spent, I gave him all I had to give.
200680	203760	That's what relationships are, I give and take.
203760	207760	You give your all to someone, and you expect them to do the same for you.
207760	210400	And you know what he does?
210400	213680	Just runs away, out of the blue.
213680	218360	No talking, no indication anything is wrong, just leaves.
218360	220080	I couldn't understand.
220080	224840	I was high off of my affection for him, and I thought he was the same.
224840	227440	But I had to hold in my sadness.
227440	231040	I, for one, am better than leaving without a word.
231040	235880	Relationships, no matter what, should be ended properly.
235880	241280	After all, sometimes relationships don't work out for reasons you don't understand.
241280	246000	But where there was true love, there can be a lot of fun to be had.
246000	246880	Right?
246880	249600	Before cutting ties.
250600	262920	After that, it was fling after fling, a new love here and there, all ending the same way.
262920	267760	I hate having to be the nice one in the relationship.
267760	269640	It can't be my fault.
269640	273520	I guess men will take any chance to abuse your kindness.
273520	277680	Now the break of songs and the radio start to make sense, and the sweetest sugars are
277680	279920	now as bitter as vinegar.
279920	286080	It's times like this when I think I'm about to give up on love entirely, but as they say,
286080	288240	time heals all wounds.
288240	292400	After that, it feels like the very first time.
