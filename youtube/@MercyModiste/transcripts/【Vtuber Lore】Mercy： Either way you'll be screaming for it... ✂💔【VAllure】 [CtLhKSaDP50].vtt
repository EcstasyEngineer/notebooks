00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
It's always one heartbreak after another.

00:07.040 --> 00:12.160
There are people who just love the drama of relationship, but I don't think anyone specifically

00:12.160 --> 00:14.280
pines for heartbreak.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.520
I mean, I always give my best.

00:17.520 --> 00:23.600
I try to be more than fair as a girlfriend, but sometimes I get nit thinking that somehow

00:23.600 --> 00:25.800
it's all my fault.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.600
I just can't wrap my head around how that could be possible.

00:29.600 --> 00:34.920
There are times like this where I try to think back to the start of my love life, starting

00:34.920 --> 00:38.240
with my first love and first loss.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.680
Maybe try to compare and see where I went wrong this time.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.280
It started back in early college.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.800
I was studying to become a fashion designer if you can believe that.

00:50.800 --> 00:57.320
I wasn't as, well, deliciously brazen in my outfit choices as I am now.

00:57.320 --> 01:02.240
A quiet, much-to-overlook girl who never got invited to parties.

01:02.240 --> 01:07.920
Their loss, though I imagine I had more fun sewing, crafting and anything else a grandma

01:07.920 --> 01:10.040
would do with spare time.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.760
An old soul people would call me.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.440
I was content in my own quiet.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.080
That was until I met my first love.

01:20.080 --> 01:26.320
I don't know what he saw in me, but he was the one to make the first move.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.360
Even before I had the mind addressed to attract the male gaze.

01:30.360 --> 01:35.040
Here I was more of an ominous sheet ghost, whatever the reason.

01:35.040 --> 01:39.400
Here was a man who takes charge where he needs to.

01:39.400 --> 01:45.920
He was a dirty, rabid-looking man who stank a booze and oozed failure and degeneracy.

01:45.920 --> 01:52.000
In retrospect, in our first meeting, he was a bit more pushy than I'm used to nowadays.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.880
It's best to understand that the pillar of a strong relationship is setting up boundaries

01:56.880 --> 02:00.080
and it's best to do it as soon as possible.

02:00.080 --> 02:05.000
Putting your foot down, telling your partner what's what is a risk you have to take.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.160
It was because of that I remembered that I always keep my fabric scissors with me.

02:11.160 --> 02:17.800
When you interact with your partner honestly, if the love is true, they can feel your intent.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.480
That's when the honest, purest part of them comes out.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.480
My favorite stage in all of my relationships.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.960
It was like he was a completely different person from his introduction.

02:29.960 --> 02:35.480
He showed me his true self, a part men are taught to hide away, the soft, sweet, vulnerable

02:35.480 --> 02:36.480
man inside.

02:36.480 --> 02:40.680
I mean, how could I not fall for him?

02:40.680 --> 02:46.000
I don't think I have a particular type per se, but a man who expresses his emotions in

02:46.000 --> 02:49.400
such a delicious way, that's something I couldn't resist.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.560
I just had to have him.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.920
I had brought him to an old shed my family owns, the best I could do at the time, but

02:56.920 --> 02:59.960
together our love can make it a home.

02:59.960 --> 03:07.720
You see, good relationships are built on compromise, and I, and compromise I did.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.560
I gave that man everything, everything he could ever want.

03:11.560 --> 03:17.040
I bathed him, fed him, cared for him, gave myself to him.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.680
The time we spent, I gave him all I had to give.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.760
That's what relationships are, I give and take.

03:23.760 --> 03:27.760
You give your all to someone, and you expect them to do the same for you.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.400
And you know what he does?

03:30.400 --> 03:33.680
Just runs away, out of the blue.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.360
No talking, no indication anything is wrong, just leaves.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.080
I couldn't understand.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.840
I was high off of my affection for him, and I thought he was the same.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.440
But I had to hold in my sadness.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.040
I, for one, am better than leaving without a word.

03:51.040 --> 03:55.880
Relationships, no matter what, should be ended properly.

03:55.880 --> 04:01.280
After all, sometimes relationships don't work out for reasons you don't understand.

04:01.280 --> 04:06.000
But where there was true love, there can be a lot of fun to be had.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.880
Right?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.600
Before cutting ties.

04:10.600 --> 04:22.920
After that, it was fling after fling, a new love here and there, all ending the same way.

04:22.920 --> 04:27.760
I hate having to be the nice one in the relationship.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.640
It can't be my fault.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.520
I guess men will take any chance to abuse your kindness.

04:33.520 --> 04:37.680
Now the break of songs and the radio start to make sense, and the sweetest sugars are

04:37.680 --> 04:39.920
now as bitter as vinegar.

04:39.920 --> 04:46.080
It's times like this when I think I'm about to give up on love entirely, but as they say,

04:46.080 --> 04:48.240
time heals all wounds.

04:48.240 --> 04:52.400
After that, it feels like the very first time.
