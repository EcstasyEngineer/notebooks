What better story than that of a modest young student turned violent yandere overnight?

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
I didn't always look like this, but maybe you're enjoying the view.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
You better be careful staring at me like that.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I might want to call you my next senpai.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Oh, don't ask what happened to the last one.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
I'm Mercy Modiste.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Because either way, you'll be screaming for mercy.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
I'd say don't be scared of me, but fear is a top shelf ad for DZAC.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Hahahaha!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh, come on.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Don't pretend you don't want more of me.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
So I better see you on June 1st.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
That's when I debut.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Senpai.
