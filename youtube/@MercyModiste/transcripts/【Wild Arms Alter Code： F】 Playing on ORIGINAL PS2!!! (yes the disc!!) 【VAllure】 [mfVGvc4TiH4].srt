13
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,420
Hello everyone, welcome to the stream.

14
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:16,420
I wanted to talk about...today!

15
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Hello everyone, welcome to the stream.

16
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Hello everyone, welcome to the stream.

17
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Way too early in the morning.

18
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:57,420
Way too early in the morning, that should be illegal.

19
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,420
Honestly, hot yoga, a regular yoga.

20
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,420
It's a special yoga.

21
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,420
It was...what do you call it?

22
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Um...

23
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Give me a second, I need to make sure that this yoga isn't specific to certain places.

24
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Hold on, I just need to check.

25
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:47,420
Otherwise it might...it might...it might like...review my location.

26
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:57,420
Gotta make sure it's not a doxable thing.

27
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:07,420
I think...I think...I think...I think it's...

28
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,420
I think it's pretty, pretty universal.

29
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,420
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

30
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:20,420
It's a special...it's a special yoga called goat yoga.

31
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:36,420
So...little, little baby goats.

32
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Little baby goats run around and then they jump on your backs when you do the yoga.

33
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,420
Yoga with the bleeding heart?

34
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,420
Honestly, that would be cute though.

35
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,420
But yeah, that's what I did.

36
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,420
That's...uh...what I did, yeah.

37
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,420
Unfortunately...

38
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:32,420
Um...unfortunately, I arrived really late because I got the wrong address.

39
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,420
And I didn't get the memo.

40
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,420
I didn't get the memo because I asked like, oh hey, do I need to bring like a yoga mat?

41
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:51,420
I didn't get the memo that I was supposed to bring it because everyone told me, no, no, no, you don't bring a yoga mat, it's provided.

42
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,420
And I was like, okay, I get there and it's not provided.

43
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:12,420
So I had to do yoga raw on the ground.

44
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,420
And I had to take a shower right after.

45
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Yeah, it's the hardcore one, raw talking yoga.

46
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,420
That's what I did.

47
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,420
So yeah, I ended up not having a mat or anything.

48
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Yeah, it was tough.

49
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,420
It was tough.

50
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:53,420
My knees were like all like dirty and my hands were like covered in like dirt and it was awful.

51
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:03,420
It was awful, but I got...they gave me the wrong information so they were like, here, you can have a free class next time.

52
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:12,420
But I got to witness goats climbing on people's back.

53
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:22,420
They didn't climb on my back though, probably because I'm like super unflexible and they looked at me and saw like a fucking shaky, shaky ender.

54
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,420
So that's what happened.

55
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,420
And I was like, okay, I'll take the free class, yippee.

56
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
Yippee.

57
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:48,420
And it was funny because I got to see one of the baby goats poop on someone's yoga mat.

58
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
It was great.

59
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,420
I got to pet them and hold them.

60
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,420
Turns out that poop a lot.

61
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
They poop a lot.

62
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Honestly, I was like, wow, being a baby, a little baby goat must be so nice because they just jump around, do whatever they want, eat all the stuff they want.

63
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:26,420
They get to eat so much food and they get to poop anywhere they want. That's great, right?

64
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:37,420
Well, see the thing is I had to find a spot where the goats didn't poop.

65
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
That was my issue.

66
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:47,420
I ended up having to do yoga at a part where the goat peed and I was like, dang it.

67
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
Gosh darn it.

68
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,420
So I dodged the poop, but I say they were like...

69
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:20,420
Oh yeah, you're going to do yoga here? How about we just pee here first?

70
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
And I said, okay.

71
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,420
And I was like, great.

72
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:39,420
And then after that, I went to the washroom and just soap and wash everything down.

73
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Then I had to go get brunch with everyone, which by the way, my friends also went there with me because we did a group discount.

74
00:18:52,420 --> 00:19:02,420
And the group discount was like, it was way cheaper to do the group discount than to do it.

75
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,420
Nobody had yoga mats.

76
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Nobody had yoga mats.

77
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
I wasn't alone.

78
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
I wasn't alone.

79
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,420
The goats had to do it too.

80
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,420
So yeah.

81
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,420
So I ended up washing my hands hard-core and everything.

82
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:41,420
And then we had a reservation to have brunch, so we couldn't miss that.

83
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,420
And then after that, we went our separate ways.

84
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,420
I ended up going to a flea market.

85
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,420
And I was like, oh boy, oh boy, howdy.

86
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:03,420
Luckily, goat piss and poop isn't really smelly.

87
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,420
Luckily, it's not really smelly.

88
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,420
So I was able to go around.

89
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,420
I did find some stuff though.

90
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,420
I got the Hamtaro game.

91
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:27,420
I got the Hamtaro game, the Game Boy Color game.

92
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

93
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
There's a Hamtaro game.

94
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
You don't know about the Hamtaro games.

95
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,420
Those are like so good.

96
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,420
My friends told me it's like really, really good.

97
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:48,420
And I got the, I got some like other games that I was sort of interested in.

98
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,420
Oh, and I decided to get the Imagineer series.

99
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,420
No, the Imagine, no, just, it's called just imagine, right?

100
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:08,420
The Imagine series where they like re-skinned all these like girly, girly Otome games.

101
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Why are we talking about goat poop?

102
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:24,420
Because I went to goat yoga and goat yoga, goats happen to poop a lot.

103
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,420
But yeah, I ended up getting one of those and I was like, oh wow.

104
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,420
But it seems really nice to be like a little goat.

105
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,420
You

106
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,420
You

107
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,420
You

108
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,420
You

109
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
You

110
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
You

111
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,420
In trouble because this is this got like copyrighted.

112
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Like like not like a copyright warning.

113
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,420
It's just like a copyright thingy where they're just like, hey, so we noticed you playing this.

114
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,420
We want a piece of that.

115
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,420
All right, I think I had to go to Lolita.

116
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,420
Park over them royalty, sunny.

117
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,420
They're just like, and I'm just like, oh, can I?

118
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,420
Wait, does anyone remember which way Lolita is?

119
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Last time it was water sounds.

120
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Yeah.

121
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
North, I think.

122
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,420
We're already forgetting things.

123
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
Okay.

124
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
I claim is a better than a strike.

125
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Yeah.

126
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,420
Starting to think that JRPGs are your favorite genres.

127
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,420
I like to do things that are, is it here?

128
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
Oh shit.

129
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,420
I forgot they had this like weird thing.

130
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Yes.

131
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,420
Is this it?

132
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,420
Hey, I hate this thing by the way.

133
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,420
I hate the scanning the math thing.

134
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
Let me in.

135
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,420
I hate that.

136
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
I hate that.

137
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,420
Either people, not zombies, right?

138
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
My friend was killed by monsters while working.

139
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,420
He snuck up on him.

140
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
We were so close to the treasure then.

141
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,420
Please, you guys, give those monsters hell for all of us.

142
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,420
You see the doctor?

143
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:00,420
She's busy with her equation on the office over on the east side.

144
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
At any last, he might be hesitant to interrupt her,

145
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,420
but please stop by and at least say hello.

146
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
It's worried about you.

147
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,420
We have great confidence in our strength.

148
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,420
But when we confronted with monsters,

149
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
we can't handle them like soil or rock.

150
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Okay, let's go see things.

151
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Oh, there's the doctor, the green one.

152
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,420
I'm quite impressed.

153
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,420
You somehow managed, somehow found an exploring party.

154
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Good job, young man.

155
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,420
Now I can vouch for you.

156
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
Well, best of luck.

157
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,420
You need it.

158
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
Are you ready?

159
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
Yeah.

160
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,420
Okay.

161
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
I hope you're ready to deal with the ruins.

162
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,420
I want to figure out why the ruins power lines are cut.

163
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
If you fall in battle within the ruins,

164
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
I'm going to have a hard time saving me.

165
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
Oops.

166
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,420
I don't need anything else, right?

167
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
I've been getting a few stuff.

168
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Search.

169
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
Without some special knowledge,

170
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,420
you can't operate the terminal.

171
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,420
A device is on, which prevents the door from being opened.

172
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,420
I should probably go back.

173
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,420
Shoot.

174
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
You need spells.

175
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
Fire.

176
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,420
And you need...

177
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,420
I think you can just attack, too.

178
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,420
Yeah.

179
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
You...

180
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,420
They spin, girls.

181
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,420
They were so silly when they were on fire.

182
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
Shoot.

183
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Yeah.

184
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

185
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,420
Like, look at everyones like levels.

186
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,980
Rudy is level eight, Jack is level nine,

187
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,460
and then Cecilia is level five.

188
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,020
What the hell did I go wrong?

189
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,060
I feel like I should go back and be like,

190
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,980
yeah, actually I'm ready, tea.

191
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:57,940
Yeah, I'm ready now.

192
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,060
Well, I feel relieved.

193
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,740
I will go back to my work.

194
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,660
I have a noble mission to restore power to the ruins.

195
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,180
If you meet Lallithia, let me know.

196
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,700
Me going.

197
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,180
I sure hope Lallithia is a cute girl.

198
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,580
That fire puzzle.

199
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,060
Yeah, that was mostly my fault.

200
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,780
I can't remember.

201
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,340
How do I run again?

202
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,900
There's some commands that I totally

203
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,580
forgot how to do because I'm running.

204
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,740
I'm running like 3JRPG at once.

205
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,340
Was it X?

206
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,840
Gun.

207
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,700
You can go.

208
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,460
How many are there?

209
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,220
Just two?

210
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,380
You can go for the other one.

211
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,880
Ow.

212
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,180
Ow.

213
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,180
Fire!

214
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
PK Fire!

215
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Ha ha ha ha!

216
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,180
The X?

217
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,660
Oh.

218
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,180
Doot, doot, doot.

219
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,180
Fault!

220
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Fire!

221
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,180
Hit.

222
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
Ha ha ha!

223
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Ow!

224
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,180
God damn.

225
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
HP Robber.

226
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
Oh, come on.

227
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
Hit.

228
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Oh, you're still alive?

229
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
Shit.

230
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,180
Fault!

231
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Not, not, shoot.

232
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
Hit!

233
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Hit.

234
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
OK, we're good.

235
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
That was big, though.

236
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,180
Man, my bit just went all the way down.

237
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
Here, let me turn.

238
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
Yeah, treasure!

239
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,180
I knew I found something.

240
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Contain party item crest graph.

241
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,180
What the heck is that?

242
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,180
There's a treasure box, solidly locked.

243
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,180
If force is used, it may break.

244
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,180
All right, plus a second.

245
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Or we can, or we can run.

246
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
It's a frog.

247
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,180
What do you have for your specials?

248
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Boosted shell.

249
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,180
Eh, sure.

250
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,180
You, fire.

251
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,180
You, feed thing.

252
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
That is, that is a lot, actually.

253
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,180
Hydro launcher.

254
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
No!

255
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,180
Don't launch your Hydro at me.

256
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Wait, all my MP is frozen, like, gone.

257
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Rudy!

258
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,180
Rudy!

259
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,180
Why do you have such so little MP?

260
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,180
Wait, Rudy doesn't use MP, seriously?

261
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Give me a second.

262
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Come on.

263
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,180
Open up.

264
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Yeah.

265
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
Contain cartridge, sniper bullet.

266
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,180
Sniper bullet temporarily increases your reaction and attack accuracy.

267
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,180
It's effective on enemies that recover or enemies you miss when attacking.

268
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
Temporary?

269
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Do I need to equip it?

270
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Temporary!

271
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Temporary, thank you, Kyden, for the 199 super.

272
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Who needs MP when you got gun?

273
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Gun is such a strong weapon.

274
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
Oops, that was not what I wanted.

275
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
Sniper bullet.

276
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Is this, like, a perma thing?

277
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,180
Oh, just gun.

278
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,180
I don't know what a crush does.

279
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
I'll use it on the frog.

280
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,180
And then you.

281
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,180
Speed thing.

282
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,180
No, it's temporary.

283
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,180
I'm so sad.

284
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
It's crush.

285
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,180
What does it do?

286
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,180
Not much, not to self, do not use.

287
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,180
I don't like that it's, like, little mouth.

288
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
It has veins?

289
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,180
It doesn't, I don't like that.

290
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
I don't like that.

291
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,180
What is that?

292
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,180
These pillars are the sleeping grave keepers.

293
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,180
When these two pillars awake, the path will be opened.

294
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,180
How do I wake up?

295
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Oh.

296
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
Wake them.

297
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,180
Let's bomb.

298
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,180
Do I have to hit them at the same time then?

299
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,180
Hey, it worked!

300
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Ha ha ha!

301
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
Ooh!

302
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
Fit!

303
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,180
Give me, give me, give me.

304
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Use gun.

305
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
Use gun.

306
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,180
You'll use fire.

307
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,180
You'll use this.

308
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,180
Nice.

309
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,180
Ow.

310
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Gun is so good.

311
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Who's gun?

312
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,180
I need them to level up faster.

313
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,180
Gun is very powerful.

314
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,180
I agree.

315
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
There's nothing else here, right?

316
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
I think we're good.

317
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,180
Wee.

318
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,180
Oh, do we get a cutscene?

319
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
Cutscene!

320
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,180
A mechanical crane is set up at the excavation site.

321
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,180
This is a very large project.

322
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,180
What could be sleeping in Lalithia's coffin?

323
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,180
I hope it's a cute girl!

324
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Gun.

325
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Gun.

326
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,180
I think fire works on you because water?

327
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,180
Maybe?

328
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
I can't quite remember.

329
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180
And attack.

330
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
Oh wait!

331
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
You just hit them once.

332
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
Nice.

333
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
Nice!

334
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Look at you guys!

335
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,180
You guys are doing such a good job!

336
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
You found the treasure chest.

337
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
Open.

338
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
A chemo coin.

339
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Nice.

340
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Which way should I go?

341
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,180
Oh, there's a big thingy here.

342
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
I'll pull it.

343
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,180
There's no reaction from the lever.

344
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,180
Maybe if the power is restored or...

345
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,180
The device is on, which prevents the door from being opened.

346
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,180
Okay, Senpai, left or right?

347
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,180
Gun!

348
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,180
I guess fire is okay too.

349
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
And...

350
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,180
Whatever you have.

351
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
Gun.

352
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,180
Nice.

353
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Okay, I'm seeing a lot more rights.

354
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,180
Right into your heart.

355
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
My heart is sell.

356
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
Ha ha ha!

357
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
Ha ha ha!

358
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,180
Ha ha ha!

359
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
Ha ha ha!

360
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Steer the ship's health!

361
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,180
Oh wait!

362
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
That thing's...

363
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,180
That thing's...

364
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,180
Not weak to fire.

365
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
Should I have gotten something else?

366
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Yeah, gun.

367
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,180
Gun.

368
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,180
I'm just thinking like...

369
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,180
Oh, should I have gotten a different crest spell thing?

370
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,180
Was that a bad idea?

371
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,180
Was that a bad idea, Senpai?

372
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
What's the crest...

373
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Graph thing?

374
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,180
It was like when you...

375
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,180
There's a small gas leak coming from a hole in the center of the pedestal.

376
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,180
I...

377
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,180
I fix it...

378
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,180
With a bomb.

379
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
Ha ha ha ha!

380
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
What's this?

381
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Fire spewing time?

382
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
Wait, how do I change, um...

383
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
How do I change characters?

384
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Did I learn that?

385
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,180
Did I learn how to change characters?

386
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
Select change.

387
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
Luck?

388
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
Bad.

389
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,180
Thank you.

390
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Um...

391
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
Is it four?

392
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,180
Oh...

393
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
That's not...

394
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
That's not right.

395
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,180
Wait, Senpai!

396
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
I don't remember this.

397
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
Not in the menu.

398
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,180
What's the button?

399
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,180
Oh!

400
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
Yes, we found it!

401
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
Hold on.

402
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,180
Isn't it weird?

403
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
Let's see.

404
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
Senpai?

405
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Senpai!

406
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,180
Not this type of puzzle again, hold on!

407
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,180
Ahhhhhhhhh!

408
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,380
Is it, is it?

409
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,340
OOOOOOH!!!

410
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:19,960
Wait, I have to spin faster?

411
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,520
WAAAAAAAAAAAA!

412
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:30,740
Wow, I suck at this so much.

413
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,400
Why is it not, why is she not spinning fast enough?

414
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Whoa

415
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,960
That's not hold on it's my stick not working

416
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Empire

417
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:04,920
Some pie some pie some pie broke some pies broke some pie broke what I do

418
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
Oh

419
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,740
There is no all done for should I oh no do I have to reset it? No

420
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,960
No, I didn't want to reset it. Okay, just a month there

421
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Yeah

422
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,400
Make sure the disc isn't scratched and I'm pretty sure it's not scratched

423
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,640
It does sound like

424
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Does sound like a furnace though

425
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
Hopefully it works just fine

426
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,440
And

427
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,120
The ps2 sounds brings back memories good thing I'm playing on an actual ps2 I

428
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,660
Spun too fast they couldn't handle it

429
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,840
Well, that sucks

430
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,440
You

431
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,440
You

432
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,440
You

433
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,440
You

434
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
I

435
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Want to save the progress again

436
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,100
Well now that we're out here, maybe I can do like a maybe I can look at the crests again

437
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,960
Edit tack magic

438
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,240
Which one's this crush?

439
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,440
I

440
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,160
Don't know which one should I do should I use giel get the thunder spell

441
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,160
Korae this one

442
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,400
Or this one which ones the thunder spell

443
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,440
I

444
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,080
Can't do any

445
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,840
It's because I don't have that crest

446
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:44,200
Absorb enemies this is all the status earth damage

447
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,640
Dark damage lowers the fans thunder I was thunder I

448
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,400
Don't think I have the crest for it though. I think I have to find some

449
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,200
Need to get the crest graph from the chest again, I'm lacking a graph seriously

450
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,720
Should I break one down again

451
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,120
Return spell

452
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,760
Yeah, Christian seemed very good for this dungeon I was thinking we can like change it

453
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,560
What are your frogs weak to they gave me a whole thing

454
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,200
Oh you found one in the tomb just before you win

455
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,120
Always saved okay, let's try I

456
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,720
Can put the thunder one right this one

457
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,120
Yeah

458
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Hopefully it works on frogles

459
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
To be honest I've only

460
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,960
My first time like really playing the ps2. No wait actually I would I played a devil

461
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,000
Devil

462
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,760
Summoner

463
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,600
Yeah, oh no, no digital devil saga. Sorry

464
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,880
Talk to everyone

465
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,840
You just want to see things, you know

466
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,440
Devil summoner was the DS game the one with right all question mark

467
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,880
That devil summoner

468
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,880
I

469
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:57,920
Can't remember which one was which anyways, I would play the one with the rock the ride. Oh dude, and I played

470
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,120
Digital devil saga. Yeah

471
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,360
Big shoot I

472
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840

473
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,820

475
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Oh fuck

476
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,920
All right

477
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,120
I think we got it. I think we found it

478
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,720
Crest graph should we go back should we go back and like get more crust

479
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,360
Devil summoner 2 is on ps2. Yeah that one. Oh

480
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,400
It's summoner not

481
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,760
Oh

482
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,240
First we kill I want to test it on the frog

483
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,680
And then

484
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
Eat

485
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,720
Actually, I think lightning was the right choice. Thank you whoever suggested that. Thank you

486
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,600
What

487
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,160
Open it

488
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,920
And give me a coin to lock it up. I treasure

489
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:22,640
Come on open

490
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,440
We're gonna go back to town

491
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,440
I

492
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Who

493
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,440
Kill

494
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,060
Yeah, one hit kill yeah, that's good

495
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,120
Oh

496
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
At least they died quickly as they should they shouldn't prolong the pain in the inevitable

497
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,760
The pain is the best part. Oh, I taught you all so well

498
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,680
Maybe that's a bad thing

499
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,120
I'm hitting an entire town

500
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:16,000
Okay edit attack magic I have one more crest

501
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,440
Should I use what's what's this one? Why is it so expensive?

502
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Absorb

503
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,320
HP and transfer to own MP that sounds really good

504
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,480
Dark damage when damage

505
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,200
Enemies get items HP damage is determined by fp percentage

506
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,160
Don't attribute damage that spreads out

507
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,080
lower magic resistance

508
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,320
Looks ice damage

509
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,680
Water damage

510
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,440
Any good support magic I can see

511
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,520
Races offensive allies temporarily recovers

512
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,040
Unmechly cover one time

513
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,720
Reflects physical damage one time raise the magic defensive allies temporarily

514
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,360
Analyzes and displays enemy information increases luck temporarily

515
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
Increases amount of force received

516
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,880
Execute the last command given

517
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,720
Get a barrier that reflects magical attacks. That one sounds good

518
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,680
Run away from battle urgently run away from battle increase reaction time

519
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,600
increase evasion

520
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,600
Your negative status in battle

521
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,880
keep positive status until the battle ends and

522
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,180
cure disability in battle

523
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,880
I don't know the absorbing HP one sounded good. I almost feel like expensive

524
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:11,320
You like but this one was this one execute the last command given. What's that one's so expensive?

525
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,720
That one's so expensive automatically recover one time

526
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:25,740
I'm leaning towards this one absorb HP and transfer to own HP

527
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,400
It looks like it might be cool. Yeah

528
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,040
I don't know what this has fire damage

529
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:54,120
Probably worth the price the HP to HP. All right, we're gonna do it

530
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,400
Oh

531
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,400

532
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,360
Save final offer

533
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,120
I

534
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,840
Have the bad habit of not saving in a different slot

535
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,120
Obsie daisies

536
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,360

01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:01,000
If memory serves serves this guy's a rare enemy what?

549
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,360

554
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,760
And those are any

555
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,040
And then

556
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,480
Yeah, good times

557
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,400
Oh, yeah, when in doubt

558
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:45,800
What in doubt bomb

559
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:02,360

560
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,360
I'm better

561
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,680
On my head

562
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,600
Hit

563
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,160
Stop getting hit

564
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:41,560
When I said hit I didn't mean you get hit I meant, you know the enemy get hit, okay

565
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,760
So

566
01:05:44,760 --> 01:06:14,720
What if Kohai went left and said should I go left?

567
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:40,800
But I want to run it back, run back the flames of love.

568
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,800
What if spin to win freezes again?

569
01:06:47,800 --> 01:07:06,080
There's a gala coin to save, do I still have a gala coin?

570
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:26,160
That's not the right one, hold on, close the menu again, no, no, no, I forgot, there it

01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:43,280
There we go, alright, yeah, I did it, there's nothing else at the side, right?

574

01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,540
.

588
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,640
Come on.

589
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:33,320
Switch to Jackie, boo.

590
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,360
Got some special knowledge.

591
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,360
Nope.

592
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,360
Maybe I can hit the switch now.

593
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,360
Let's go back.

594
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:45,380
Wow.

595
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:51,900
Ow.

596
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:58,860
What the fuck.

597
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:21,460
Ow. What the fuck? Why do you hit so hard?

598
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:39,540
Stop living. You must die. Damn. Or maybe I should go back to the room and be like yo

599
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:54,020
What's up out? At least HP drain can be used. Yeah during battle.

600
01:14:54,020 --> 01:15:22,380
Dude. Magic. It. Oh thank goodness they die easily. Jack's already at level 10. What the fuck?

601
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:40,220
Jack always like level up the fastest in my opinion. Is it physically possible to like go

602
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:52,700
door? Wait that's not a door. Wait that's not a door. That's not a door. That was me being dumb.

603
01:15:53,660 --> 01:16:05,180
Maybe this is a door.

604
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:23,260
What does this thing remind me of? All right the little

605
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:32,300
spiderly guy. Do you guys watch Digimon? The Digimon movie where they like put in three

606
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:39,740
movies together and into one? You know the spindly virus guy? That's what he looks like.

607
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:41,340
And he spins the same way.

608
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,900
Vice is on which prevents the door. Okay. Probably can hit the switch or something.

609
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,700
Yeah he moves like him.

610
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:05,420
And all the virus. Informon. Yeah. Does this name Informon? Anyways the one that like

611
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:13,340
messed up everything I was gonna send missiles to Japan? That one.

612
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:33,980
Honestly wild. Yeah mom's cooking is like a hamburger milkshake?

613
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,740
Izzy you want a hamburger milkshake?

614
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:47,980
Did you mom was gonna do what? Yeah.

615
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,420
Didn't have to direct that one.

616
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:19,980
Oh Soda. I don't remember director's name but probably.

617
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,260
Please shoot. Thank you.

618
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:39,980
What else did he do? Did he do summer wars? Sounds like a familiar name.

619
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:54,300
Yeah same guy. Yeah. Yeah I thought so. It's the same style. It's the same style. It's the uh

620
01:18:54,700 --> 01:19:00,060
Oh hey look. One door is light up.

621
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:10,540
Is lit up? Lighten up? Wow I can't speak right now. English is my first language I swear.

622
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:38,060
I did get up extra early.

623
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:48,620
I want my bit for Cecilia to go up. I'm gonna have to start using the more HP stuff soon.

624
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:53,900
I don't think I can hit the switch yet. I gotta go to the other side.

625
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:05,340
Bit.

626
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:10,620
Hit.

627
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:18,140
Hit. Yeah hit. I'm like I can't. I don't gain anything.

628
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:27,340
Oh yeah good good miss. I'm hitting X now because of Mario RPG.

629
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:35,340
And I'm like oh yeah dodge. Fuck.

630
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:47,500
The Mario impulses always take over. The hecky wacky is this?

631
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,460
I need someone to stand on the other side right?

632
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:10,540
Hold on let me get that stinking. That's stinking half pan.

633
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:21,340
Which I have so hard controlling. I have a hard time controlling that bitch.

634
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,700
Oh fuck.

635
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,460
Yes there we go.

636
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:36,380
He moves like in a weird way so it's hard to control him.

637
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,100
No.

638
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:57,820
Die!

639
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:12,740
And the knock back for the criticals are so funny

640
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:24,780
Give me that

641
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:52,700
Yeah, I wish they shoot like the the one the one

642
01:22:52,700 --> 01:23:01,360
I don't know where it's from. I think it's from like some show. It's like saying it's when they were like

643
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:11,520
They're like it's Friday in California, huh?

644
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,520
How on like that

645
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,400
Issues with controlling a road and you should ask Amy Kauai

646
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,920
I don't think Amy can even control her rodents

647
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:59,280
Although I did I was thinking because I was like looking at them

648
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,760
And I was like all it would be nice to have like

649
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,200
You know how I like I like, you know those cosplay ears

650
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:23,280
Some places are fragile enough to break when party rocks over them and walking on this type of floor hold the button

651
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,600
What the fuck okay

652
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:38,720
No, I have to walk on them like this

653
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,840
Let me just bend the camera because I'm bad at this

654
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,640
I

655
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,200
Am happened, okay, and I have to press B right

656
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,680
Not be circle wow

657
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,960
I am so bad

658
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,920
Oh

659
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,840
It doesn't help that all of those all of these buttons are different

660
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:44,880
The PlayStation button the Xbox button the switch buttons. They're all different

661
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,840
Oh

662
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,560
Thank goodness easy

663
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,560
Oh

664
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,840
Being told to press X is why I have trust issues

665
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,480
Right, you're just like

666
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,960
This button or the top button

667
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,960
Or the button on the left this that's the one right yes

668
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:39,520
I say I'm not a gamer and I feel like it's still true because I still don't remember them

669
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,320
Well, at least I'm taking zero damage

670
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,400
I

671
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,360
Feel like I'm not a not a gamer though because like

672
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:05,600
Very bad at like platforming and like regular things if it's a puzzle. I think I'm okay

673
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,120
But if it's like, uh

674
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,920
Anything to do with skills

675
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:31,040
It's like my gaming knowledge is like

676
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,040
It's like puzzles yeah, I can do puzzles

677
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,560
My skills definitely are elsewhere

678
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
Yeah

679
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,480
It's like why

680
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:13,520
It's like how can you solve these puzzles but not be able to to coordinate and hit the buttons at the same time

681
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,400
Yes

682
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,200
I go in

683
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:48,640
For solemn grave keepers turn their eyes to the center and wait for their eyes meet

684
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,040
Oh

685
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,320
Feel

686
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,760
Hope sorry wrong fuck

687
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,520
We're not quite there yet

688
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,760
They have to be pointing at each other right

689
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,040
This is so hard to turn the wheel

690
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,880
There you go, that is correct, right?

691
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,120
They are turned to the center

692
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,920
Oh

693
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,160
Yes, there we go

694
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,640
Oh hi there

695
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,560
It's like that thing found a home

696
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,240
Seen the energy in the ruins we defeat it we might be able to return the power to the ruins

697
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,120
You must be careful then tends to eat us as well

698
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,360
What are you

699
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,120
You

700
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,480
Shoot

701
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,240
How lightning works on him

702
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,200
You

703
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,840
Oh no

704
01:31:54,400 --> 01:32:10,080
Hi, he was eating electricity. Well, maybe

705
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,040
Oh, maybe he doesn't like my electricity

706
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,040
Oh

707
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,240
I get some fucking life drain fuck

708
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,640
Oh

709
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:23,120
And do a boost to chaff for you and a heal well for me and you get speed

710
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,040
Oh

711
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,280
Did it die

712
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:57,200
Whoa it exploded into billion pieces. I love gun. Thank you gun

713
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,880
Can I go forward now

714
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,520
Is this

715
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,400
Lalithia

716
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,960
I am suddenly disappointed that Lalithia

717
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,840
Is not a cute little girl

718
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,280
Like a cute girl in a in a pretty dress

719
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,040
What is this creature

720
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:51,440
It happened it definitely looks like a golem

721
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:58,160
A golem you mean the golem from the thousand-year-old legend that golem

722
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:02,080
Thank you

723
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,800
Logan sir now for memory for one mom cute hat. Thank you

724
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,840
You can wear one too

725
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,080
Oh

726
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:21,040
Wait a minute we came here looking for absolute power that mean the absolute power is

727
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:26,480
Yes, this golem. I don't believe it

728
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,560
I can't control this huge christ creature. Does it actually move?

729
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:40,160
Yeah, can he angry won't help

730
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,760
Anyway, well anyway, this is out of our league. We should get some help. Let's bring dr. Emma here

731
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,920
Do we get a time skip or do I have to go back myself?

732
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,600
I have to go back myself

733
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,560
So

734
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:18,240
We move

735
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,680
He did change the camera and go sometimes

736
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:28,640
I

737
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,960
Already did that

738
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:43,040
What get a wall immediately

739
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,840
Why is it zigging zagging? That's how you how you go up a hill. Did you know that?

740
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:54,800
Some pie it's easier on your feet sees if you go up a hill in a zigzag

741
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,240
I

742
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:07,600
Think if you're on a really steep incline you walk zigzag

743
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,480
Now help you alleviate the movements

744
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:32,480
I think ghosts do that, right? Yeah, so you can do that too if it's a particularly

745
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:42,880
Steep hill it'll be really easy. It takes a little longer, but like you're not like forcing your knees

746
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,440
Are

747
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:54,640
You also a wanderer or doctor and you family strong females they change

748
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:01,440
Wait, they change change depending on who you are. I'm here to slay monsters. The doc is currently in our office

749
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,880
Okay

750
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,360
And jack has a different one the ancient culture

751
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:34,640
Issue depends on your hard work. I wish you wanderers. Good luck. They really wow. That's kind of cool that they change depending on

752
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,160
On like who's who it is, you know

753
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:45,760
Now lethia, that's great. Good job. Good job everyone. Let's hurry

754
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,240
Now do I get escorted?

755
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:59,520
This is a golem a legend from a bygone era somehow it was sealed in these ruins

756
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,240
We've been excavating these ruins at the in the hopes of

757
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:09,440
Exhibit exhibiting this golem specimen at the ancient culture exhibition

758
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,360
Exhibition

759
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,680
A long time ago when Fogaya was still green there was a legend

760
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:23,520
Eight giant weapons were created to fight alien monsters that invaded our peaceful world

761
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:29,520
The severe battle ruined our world and this golem was sealed away in these ruins

762
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:36,000
Many of these weapons have been recently have recently been excavated in various ruins

763
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,960
Pixel art is different

764
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,680
This is 3d

765
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,240
What is this

766
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,400
What is the what is this called like poly?

767
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,640
Yeah, like polygons

768
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:26,900
The conditions of the ones we found have been wonderful we have plans to excavate all of these pristine golems

769
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,960
This is one we plan to excavate soon

770
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,920
But I just found my absolute power. Why did I get my hopes up?

771
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,920
This golem is gigantic. How are you going to carry it? Do you think it can move?

772
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:50,960
Unfortunately, this golem cannot move on its own. Our current technology is not sufficient to fix it

773
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,160
For that reason we'll have to remove it from the ruin by a much more primitive method

774
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:05,520
Let's start the excavation at once. It isn't fragile, so it's okay to be less than gentle with it. Let's move it

775
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,360
Aye aye, let's move

776
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:15,760
I even designed a special contraption for this momentous occasion. Let's begin

777
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,320
Oh

778
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,400
They're using um

779
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:40,160
What are those things like those lever looky thingies cranes. Yeah cranes

780
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,480
Words

781
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:57,280
Wow, I can't believe I forgot the word cranes. I just meant lever lifty thingies

782
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,520
With a pulley

783
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,920
Ah

784
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:15,040
Now presenting the mm motor i'm pretty sure this is just a crane

785
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,920
It may not have been built for this exact task, but it's proven very useful

786
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,880
This golem can finally see the light of day

787
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,560
It wouldn't be possible without your hard work and of course the emma motor

788
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:37,120
Yes, this golem's name is lolithia

789
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,480
lolithia unforgivably

790
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,080
Mecca golem

791
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,600
Giant robot thing

792
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:58,000
I'm like lolithia. Oh, it's gonna be like a girl in a cute dress in a tent and like a tube

793
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,800
An oxygen tank tube thing, right?

794
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,600
I was wrong

795
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,520
I was like it needs more frills

796
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:22,080
A cute girl might be inside ko hi. I don't believe it. There's no skirt. There's no petticoats. How can it be lolithia?

797
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,400
Ah

798
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:32,640
Okay, the ruin's name is derived from it look at this gigantic titan don't you think it's amazing

799
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:42,080
It has been dormant for centuries yet they condition it excellent so pristine and complete

800
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:49,600
The workers and I will work overtime to prepare the golem for the exhibition at the ancient culture exhibit

801
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,000
Therefore do you think you can wait a little while for the reward payment?

802
01:43:54,640 --> 01:44:01,840
I would like my reward payment now damn it. Are you gonna run off? What are you? What are you like a vtuber?

803
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,880
Are you gonna scam me? You're never gonna pay me

804
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Like come on

805
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,480
Ah

806
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,800
Wait, you're a scam

807
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:36,560
Don't worry. I will pay you your reward. You cannot just like clap your hands together and be like don't worry

808
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,120

01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:44,800
Can I at least half can I get like a four pay forward? You know what I'm saying?

810
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:52,160
Scam artist right artists am I right?

811
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:56,960
Or rather

812
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,960
What's the word? Oh

813
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:05,280
This is gonna be a little shady. This is gonna be a little shady. I don't think I should say it. I should I shouldn't say I shouldn't say it

814
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,280
I shouldn't say it

815
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,360
Should I

816
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,360
Give away artists

817
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:21,680
You know I promise to do it but never comes through it

818
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:37,280
Sorry, sorry if that's offensive, but uh, it's the first thing I thought

819
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,440
Oh

820
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:47,680
Please understand that I cannot leave this extraordinary find alone

821
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:56,160
Um, no, can I have half first, you know like a we can pay we can have installments

822
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,080
Thank you for the exposure you get from finding Lalitha god dang it

823
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,080
I

824
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,840
Need I need payment up front

825
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,280
Mac that golem

826
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,960
Lalitha it's supposed to be completely inactive and totally safe, correct?

827
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,640
Oh famous last words. Am I right?

828
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,640
I

829
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:45,840
This is so so bad first somebody's gonna push a button. Oh, what's this?

830
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,480
I

831
01:46:52,880 --> 01:47:00,160
Believe once the golem has finished his job as a weapon he's programmed to no longer be functional after that

832
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:07,040
There goes our payment it's just everything everything's gone now dang it

833
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:12,880
Oh like that scientist said the golem is not operational

834
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:19,120
This guardian said there will be a battle with the steel menace

835
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:22,160
But if that's not about Lalitha

836
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:29,280
And who does that scientist think we are we don't work for free see

837
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:39,120
I'll find out tomorrow I need to be in a hurry after all we had a very unusual day

838
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:44,960
Tomorrow be accepting rewards and visiting the ancient culture except the exhibition

839
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:50,640
I'm planning another trip out the ruins after we're finished, but I'll stick around until then

840
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,200
We just met

841
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,000
Do you have do we have to say goodbye already?

842
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,320
That's the way life of the wanderer right I always sleep under a different sky

843
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:07,360
Speaking of sleep, I'll we find lodging for the night and wait for tomorrow's exhibition

844
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:18,400
Honestly Jack is being so real right now because uh, we're about to get ripped off save

845
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,960
We're about to lose all our money

846
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,200
Do I have any more Chris?

847
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,280

848
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,400

Yes, um, yes, you could say that

855
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:50,720
I didn't understand why I felt so determined to find out what the word lolita meant

856
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,600
adventuring into the ruin with

857
01:49:54,160 --> 01:50:00,560
You both gave me a feeling that a feeling that I'm part of something part of a team. I really needed that

858
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:05,920
Even if we must part ways I will never forget this experience

859
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,040
Uh, all right great

860
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,960
I'm planning to attend the exhibition tomorrow perhaps you'll see each other

861
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:21,840
And by an if by chance we do please do not treat me any differently

862
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
She's a princess, right

863
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:32,720
Hmm. I was all that all about

864
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:39,920
You never know she could be a princess. Yeah. Yeah, I'm pan. Yeah. Yeah, you're right

865
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,360
Knock it off, you know, I don't get along with those kind of people

866
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:51,120
Excuse me fella, but excuse me fellas. Will you be staying with us?

867
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:56,980
Sorry. Oh, yes. We'll be staying here the two of us and the mouse

868
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:05,360
I don't know what hampon is

869
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:28,000
A mouse he just said but like he doesn't look like a mouse the day of the exhibition is finally here

870
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,960
Oh

871
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,920
They said he was a wind mouse. Oh shit, you're right

872
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,280
Oh shit, you're right

873
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,560
I want Rudy because

874
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,560
I

875
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:59,040
Am I going to the exhibition? Uh, well, I don't know I was just there

876
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:03,040
Sorry, but I'm exhausted from working all night making exhibition souvenirs

877
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,440
Looks like everybody from the town has gone to the exhibition

878
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:12,880
Now everyone's gone. I could snatch some drinks from the bar. No, I can't that would be wrong

879
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Ah, they do change

They do change each person has like a different

881

01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,840
Different, you know

883
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:38,720

922
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,680
She's watching a lot of my gal pals watch me

923
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,760
The tomb of king adahide all right

924
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
My friends watch me

925
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,080
Sometimes they just leave me in the background

926
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:15,280
Sometimes they leave me in the in the background to just like make some noise

927
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,400
Or like just when they're they're doing stuff

928
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:28,080
I'm not gonna lie to you it feels a little funny because

929
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:33,200
A lot of people think I'm like super introverted, but I feel I I feel like I'm very much an extrovert, but just

930
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,400
Not a

931
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,960
great extrovert

932
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:47,280
There are bundles of beautiful flowers, which are really rarely seen these days. I love flowers. I would love flowers

933
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,080
I love flowers

934
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,080
I love flowers

935
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,080
I love flowers

936
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:56,080
I love flowers

937
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,080
Flowers, I would love flowers

938
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,640
People sell flowers

939
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:06,080
Inside the farm wagon are various large juicy fruits. They look yummy yummy

940
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:15,760
Other wanderers and I also contribute ex-givaded treasures to the exhibition

941
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Of course, the royal family paid us all pretty well

942
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:23,040
Man, I'm a sharp wits like me are more interested in adahide's money than its artifacts

943
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:30,080
This sense of adahide should feel very privileged to be able to enjoy the exhibition for free

944
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,200
Why am I so irritated?

945
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:38,000
Maybe it's because in the past ancient artifacts were only seen by privileged wanderers like me

946
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,880
I love how they they literally change

947
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:50,400
Uh, depending on who you are. That's so interesting. What are kohai's favorite flowers again? Um tulips

948
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,040
It's also uh

949
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:03,200
I really like lilies and

950
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,400
Arkids as well

951
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Actually like all sorts of flowers

952
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:15,280
Exhibition seems to be leaving a strong impression on everyone from young to old

953
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:21,440
Hopefully this event will concede convince his majesty to restore fagalia with ancient technology

954
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:29,520
How did the exhibition is much larger than I anticipated all these novelties must have pricked the curiosity of the citizens of adahide

955
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,920
Wow such a different tone

956
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,360
Oh, what is this

957
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:42,240
Memory figure this machine records a traveler's memories into a specially made card

958
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,840
I want to do that

959
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:48,960
Let me do it

960
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:59,520
There are a bunch of beautiful flowers that smells like a perfume stand. I love flowers

961
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:05,920
I love all sorts of flowers to be honest. I am not very

962
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,840
There's a chest over there

963
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,160
Exhibitions just up those stairs enjoy an ancient artifacts awaits you

964
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,520
I'm relieved to see so many people enjoying the exhibition. I'm happy and content

965
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:28,160
I may I give many thanks to our castle guardian zelduks for delivering such a delightful day

966
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:37,120
Dang it

967
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Oh

968
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,680

Thanks so much gala leaves my pockets

971
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:03,040
Even my pocket makes me feel queasy. It's funny. It's not even my own money

972
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:05,040

973

Will see you soon have fun. I think sufficient. Yes my money

Use it

976
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:23,120
Right away

977
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:31,360
The artist allegations defeated

978
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,920
Gun money

979
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
You

02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,960
Are now behind excellent timing you've arrived on a good day

981
02:02:55,520 --> 02:03:00,560
Up the stairs to the other side of the castle is the ancient culture exhibit a exhibit exhibit

982
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,280
There are lots of interesting displays. I'm sure someone like you will find it quite interesting

983
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:15,120
You don't want to miss the opportunity. It should be a very interesting and quite the educational experience

984
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:17,760
She does say different stuff. Anyways gun

985
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:27,840
I need to spend it what if my money goes away?

986
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:45,680
Holy fuck attack bonus is so much

987
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:54,480
What is altar parts?

988
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:07,600
It's like almost a double the attack though should I

989
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:11,920
Do

990
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:26,960
Bucket my money is gone, but my gun is strong

991
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,680
My money is gone, but my gun is strong

992
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:42,160
I

993
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:57,280
Get 5,000 gala 4,000 goes to Rudy Rudy's more important

994
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:05,360
I'm delighted to finally see this day. Wait, I'm delighted to finally see this day

995
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:09,680
It's all because of my exceptional talent wit intelligence and beauty

996
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,840
I deserve a medal for delivering lolithia to the exhibition on time. Where's a close call?

997
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,120
Of course, I need to thank you for helping me to accomplish this

998
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:23,040
I'm sure I will be asking for your help again very

999
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:27,600
Why you gotta be like this, huh?

1000
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:33,440
So standing to see all these different people at this event shows how much effort his majesty

1001
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Put into promoting it

1002
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:42,320
Was worth well worth the long travel to see such great displays. Have you seen them all if not?

1003
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:49,760
I should start now this may sound too exaggerated. I feel like my perspective on life has changed for good

1004
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:56,000
This fossil was an ancient weapon known as a dragon

1005
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:59,600
It looks like a dinosaur

1006
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:07,680
It is said to have been used by the demons during the great war

1007
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:11,280
Studies are still underway to try to understand how it works

1008
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:19,040
Even though this artifact is old, this is a technological marvel far more advanced than anything we can make today

1009
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:26,080
Small parts are taken from the dragon fossil to power machines and appliances that are used for daily life in Fagalia

1010
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,320
My screwdriver

1011
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,320
Let me talk

1012
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:43,760
My husband has been flipping out if you ask me these ancient artifacts should be left right where they were

1013
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:47,680
I just feel like these fossils will bring us disaster

1014
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:50,720
I not tell you

1015
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:53,280
Can't tell this to my husband because he's been running around

1016
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,280
Like a little kid

1017
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:58,960
But it just freaks me out that giant things were discovered right around here

1018
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:05,280
If all those rocks I've been sitting on during lunch turns out to be gravestones, I don't like it

1019
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,600
Kind of looks oh, I see it

1020
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:18,480
Oh, I see that's that's Lolithia. Your name is Daryl. Yeah

1021
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,600
Don't you know Daryl is gender neutral probably

1022
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:31,840
Did you see all the artifacts boy, that was something it was crazy times

1023
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:35,760
Ancient people were really determined about winning the war against the demons

1024
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:40,400
I would only I would only be determined if there were cute girls involved

1025
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:43,360
Oh shit same

1026
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,720
That man thinks like me

1027
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I

1028
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:12,800
Like cute girls honestly, I really like my t-shirts that have like cute anime girls on on it

1029
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
The blue crystal is called

1030
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:34,080
Agulite the red crystal is called germatron germa mansion

1031
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,980
Why can't I escape this guy?

1032
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,080
Both are made from condensed energy and were used by the ancient alchemists

1033
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:03,040
Out of hide secrets

1034
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:06,800
Treasure the teardrop is also classified as an energy crystal

1035
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,920
More energy crystals are now only

1036
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:15,120
Seen represented in records much like the kinsome fire

1037
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:30,160
This is a preserved demons blood cylinder thing

1038
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,520
It's the type of mercury

1039
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:36,640
But its structure resembles the blood of living organisms

1040
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:43,200
We call the type of mercury mithril its density is less than that of regular mercury

1041
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:46,560
Our technology cannot duplicate it

1042
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:53,360
Man we're just learning lots. Is it oil? Wait

1043
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:59,520
Is it oil? But it said mercury that's different right? Holy shit

1044
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:12,080
Golem's so awesome looking if I were born a thousand years ago. I could have fought against the demons with golems

1045
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:17,440
Oh, wow. Wow awesome. You know ancient artifacts are cool. I'm gonna go

1046
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:21,040
I'm gonna be a wanderer when I grow up so I can see more of this stuff

1047
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:25,680
I

1048
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,640
Showpiece was provided by the famous J lady wanderer calamity jane

1049
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:44,240
Calamity Jane. Why is this such a familiar name?

1050
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:50,560
Why is this such a familiar name?

1051
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:55,600
I

1052
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:07,860
I'm pretty sure this is this a historic figure

1053
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:17,040
I knew it

1054
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:19,760
I

1055
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:26,240
Just I'm like I'm pretty sure this is a real person. I was like wait. She's here canonically too

1056
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:30,480
Out of hide must have paid her handsomely

1057
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:37,920
Anyway, it must be an awesome wanderer. I'm amazed at how she was able to retrieve such a delicate looking artifact

1058
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:41,920
I'm gonna have to take a look at what this

1059
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:45,200
Here the king of out of hide is visiting the exhibition

1060
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:50,560
Out of hide must be a safe place because they let outsiders like me walk right into the exhibition

1061
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,440
Excuse me, but I can't talk right now

1062
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,360
I think I ate too much of out of high special curry

1063
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:01,840
And I can't seem to find a single restroom around here. Oh, no. I don't feel so good

1064
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:07,280
Oh my oh boy, excuse me. Do you know where the bathroom is?

1065
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:14,560
All these signs around here say nothing about restrooms. Oh, no, I really need to go. He's not doing the potty dance. He don't need to go

1066
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:33,360
Long distance bomber golem Barbados also known as the hidden cannon

1067
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,120
Oh

1068
02:12:38,240 --> 02:12:40,240
Oh

1069
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:47,920
What does he look like he kind of looks like uh, what's the yellow robot and

1070
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:51,120
uh

1071
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:54,240
Mega man x

1072
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:03,840
I also yeah, I also see that I don't think that cannon's hidden

1073
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:05,840
Guts man

1074
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:12,720
Or he looks like an eggman

1075
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:16,180
He does look he's very like, uh

1076
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
You know

1077
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:24,080
That era type of robot

1078
02:13:25,680 --> 02:13:31,520
His shoulder holds an electric magnetic long distance cannon as well as a hidden as hidden gun ports

1079
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:39,200
He's believed he was able to communicate with new moon and its cannon was the ultimate weapon that shot beams of light

1080
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:44,400
Real cool

1081
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,560
And I just walk over

1082
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:13,600
This lore is so wild first okay first off the the aliens are robots

1083
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:21,360
Their robot aliens who come from a new moon

1084
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:28,080
They're also known as demons. Yeah, they're also known as demons. It's so wild

1085
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:30,560
This

1086
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:35,280
Mass contains unknown ore it is said to be from the sea of stars

1087
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:42,720
For it is found to contain peculiar radiation. Wait, is it supposed to be here if it has radiation?

1088
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:53,360
This might be evidence of filgain technology which allows ancient humans to reach the sea of stars

1089
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,960
This

1090
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:06,880
Archaeological artifact seems to have crash landed into ugaya

1091
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:12,720
A sketch recreating the fossil shows a dish-like shape and its reference

1092
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,360
referred to as a

1093
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:17,680
mystery disc amongst

1094
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,520
researchers

1095
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,520
That looks like a coffee maker

1096
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:26,080
It is thought to be part of an aviation device. However, it bears no similarity

1097
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:30,000
or to any other ancient technology

1098
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,960
Is it a satellite but it totally looks like a coffee maker

1099
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:40,240
Imagine if it's just a coffee maker

1100
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:51,360
You you know exactly what I mean right senpai you see the like okay, so the uh the top hold on

1101
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:56,720
Hold on the top will be where the coffee bean goes

1102
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:19,360
A fancy drip coffee one or one of those yeah fancier ones. I'm pretty sure it's just a satellite

1103
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:24,240
Excuse me. Have you seen her boy with a red balloon?

1104
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:26,720
My son

1105
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:30,960
I brought him the balloon because he was begging me for one and wow I was paying attention

1106
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:36,160
I was paying for it. He must have took it off somewhere. I've looked everywhere, but he's nowhere to be found

1107
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:39,520
If you see a boy with a red balloon, will you bring him back here for me?

1108
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:45,520
Did the boy back there have a balloon also balloon mentioned a balloon was

1109
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:48,960
Was like in the opening. Yeah

1110
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:54,320
I

1111
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:01,920
This kid didn't have a balloon bucket

1112
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:19,120
Oh my gosh, it's so I can hear the discs going cluck cluck cluck cluck cluck

1113
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:23,760
Oops terrorism

1114
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:27,520
My son's name is Tyrell

1115
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:36,000
He was holding a balloon if you need to find me. I'm going to wait by my son's favorite exhibit, Aletheia

1116
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:43,600
That was my bad. I hit the wrong button and decided to be

1117
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,200
terror incarnate

1118
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:54,160
Breaks my heart to see the look on the father's face. Please find the child quickly. I'm begging you, please

1119
02:17:56,640 --> 02:18:00,320
Okay, no change is this Aletheia

1120
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,280
Particle inhibitor golem Aletheia also known as frost disaster

1121
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:15,920
Has the ability to freeze the molecules of enemies by controlling their electromagnetic energy

1122
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:23,840
Most of the golems output energy goes to its freezing capabilities. Thus its mobility is severely limited

1123
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:30,160
All right, I might have to fight it later

1124
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
So that means I need fire

1125
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:45,360
Ancient fossils found during the excavation are classified into two different categories

1126
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:51,840
There are arms which can only be wielded by uniting the weapons with the user's mind and will

1127
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:58,480
There are also machines devices which are made up of mechanical technologies and can be used by anyone

1128
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,200
A fossil displayed here is a machine

1129
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:06,880
Machines don't discriminate and will work for anyone unlike ours

1130
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:15,120
Most modern day most modern devices used throughout Fogaya today are made by copying the technology of these ancient artifacts

1131
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:21,520
Arms and machines are both products of lost technologies and have been objects of countless studies

1132
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:29,200
Oh cute, this is a mock skeleton of a human

1133
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:36,080
The mysterious machine-made skeletons found in the ruins show many similarity to the structure of humans

1134
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:43,200
But they are different in composition. It is unknown how and why the skeletons were made. It is a mystery

1135
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:48,160
Is that a robocorp?

1136
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,720
That the fucking king. Oh king, have you seen?

1137
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:06,400
Can I talk?

1138
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:11,360
I don't know what the red balloon ran through the this room. Where's the exhibition entrance?

1139
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:15,680
Looking for a kid with a red balloon? I haven't seen him, but maybe Glenn has

1140
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:26,240
There is such beauty in these artifacts and I don't mean their appearance

1141
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:33,680
These fossils are not only examples of our ancestors intelligence, but also their resourcefulness during the great war

1142
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:40,720
I'm pleased to see such a turnout. I've been so much interested in this pet product of mine

1143
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:44,720
Please take your time. There's much to see in the exhibition hall

1144
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:48,240
I don't see it

1145
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:53,760
This looks like a what do you call it?

1146
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:58,880
Like one of those

1147
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:01,760
Transformer ones

1148
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Land battle golem Diablo

1149
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:09,520
Diablo

1150
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Also known as roaring metal

1151
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:20,400
Much of its chest space is occupied by a fearfully powerful plasma energy emission device

1152
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:24,640
P

1153
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:28,720
P

1154
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:36,240
This war machine

1155
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:43,920
Exiled at close quarters combat due to its heavily fortified armor as well as its destructive revolving arm

1156
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:49,840
It's powered by pee

1157
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:58,080
We are never beating the peeler allegations

1158
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:00,880
The

1159
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:08,240
Demi humans are aloo. I believe they're pronounced aloo

1160
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:14,960
Sided with the humans during the great war and they wielded the awesome power of the guardians

1161
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:20,000
This was possible through the use of tiles like these which are called mediums

1162
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Ten pie

1163
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:30,720
One of them looks like a peepee

1164
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:52,800
I

1165
02:22:55,760 --> 02:23:03,520
Somebody's trolling me somebody who was like, yeah, I'm gonna make they're gonna be they're gonna run on pee

1166
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:16,000
They're gonna run on pee the plasma energy emissions

1167
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:22,800
And one of the guardians is is is double that peepee

1168
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:38,960
Let's see a medium was a link to the guardians he who possessed a medium was blessed with the power of the guardians

1169
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,600
Unfortunately, these mediums are broken and have lost such abilities

1170
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,560
I

1171
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,600
Can't believe it

1172
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:05,200
A boy with a red balloon, let's see I saw him run past me towards the front gate

1173
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:15,760
A thousand years ago the forbidden weapon arm was created during the great demon war

1174
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:22,800
It is considered one of the most powerful weapons ever made and it can only be wielded by those with a strong will

1175
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:28,560
Currently, there's no one who can handle the magnitude and complexity of this peculiar arm

1176
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,960
Procure your particular sorry Grootie strong will yeah

1177
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:41,680
It's like arm that's just a gun

1178
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:45,360
Oh, we made it around in a circle

1179
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:52,960
Did I see you with a kid kid with a red balloon? Uh, I'm sorry. I don't think so. I will keep my eyes open though

1180
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:58,960
Kid with a red balloon I may have seen him or not. I cannot recall

1181
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:07,440
I was a red with a balloon or something running out of the exit. I don't think you went back inside the exhibition

1182
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Oh

1183
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:15,120
Lost child. Oh the kid with the red balloon looked really happy with that red balloon

1184
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:18,400
He was staring at it while he walked even bumped into some lady

1185
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:21,040
In and out towards town

1186
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:24,160
Some lady wait, is he kidnapped?

1187
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,160
You

1188
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:40,560
Seen a kid last kid, how would I know go ask the mayor over there?

1189
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:48,640
Oh the red balloon could be the one I saw walking around here. I've been peeking around the food and flower vendors

1190
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:54,000
Thank you furious ghost flame for

1191
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Becoming a snippet

1192
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:00,720
snippet member

1193
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:04,720
Out with the red balloon. I saw him laughing and running back towards town

1194
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:09,840
Come to his parents were already there and realize his father. I didn't know where he was

1195
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:22,080
Anyway, she's been kidnapped we gotta go. Where's the kid?

1196
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:36,480
Kid

1197
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:42,720
Oh, there. Where are you?

1198
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:54,480
Cussine no, not his balloon. No

1199
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:00,240
No, not the balloon from the opening

1200
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,960
Ah

1201
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,840
What did your balloon do?

1202
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:21,920
Above the ancient culture exhibition hell and out of hide came a sudden thunder cloud

1203
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:28,560
What the fuck was in that balloon the sudden change in weather stunned the people

1204
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:38,320
This is why you don't pollute a spectacular spectacle of spiral clouds something no one has ever seen before

1205
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:41,920
The skies

1206
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:43,920
It's split

1207
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:49,280
In the split a sword of light emerges and pierce the ground creating an intense fire

1208
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:56,720
Pandemonium rained and painted people's faces with fear

1209
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:08,960
But that was merely the beginning of the end

1210
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:19,040
I'm blinded what do fuck

1211
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:33,200
That's a lot

1212
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:38,720
Shoot good thing I I

1213
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:46,400
Oh

1214
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:49,280
Yeah

1215
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:53,360
Look how much I shoot

1216
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:04,080
Look how much I shoot thank goodness. I took that money and ran

1217
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,660
Thank goodness. I took that money and ran

1218
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:25,120
Oh my gosh, oh their father I cannot see with all the smoke

1219
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:29,840
Yeah, where am I supposed to go?

1220
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:36,160
Tyrell Tyrell answer for you can hear my voice

1221
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:40,400
Wait, can I not bring the kid over?

1222
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:58,080
Oh

1223
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,560
That sucks

1224
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:07,520
I can't bring the kid over I was just on a quest

1225
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:10,640
I mean like his dad was just there

1226
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:13,920
I kind of just let him do the dad and be like take shelter

1227
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:16,560
What the hell

1228
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:23,280
Well, at least the bird's okay

1229
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:26,240
Fuck

1230
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:50,880
Am I supposed to run into the exhibition senpai

1231
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:53,840
I want to save though

1232
02:30:57,360 --> 02:31:01,680
Hot hot it's too hot to save in progress. Oh well shit

1233
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:18,080
I can't believe the bird won't even save my progress

1234
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:20,640
What a coward

1235
02:31:22,480 --> 02:31:24,480
We gotta see if the mechs are fine

1236
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:39,600
Oh, it's literally smoke so it's hard to see

1237
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,240
There are still people left in the exhibition they need help

1238
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:53,440
We're going after them on air and heavy smoke far the path. I'm afraid there's no survivors

1239
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:57,920
Shit

1240
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:12,160
At least we got to look at everything cool

1241
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:18,400
But yeah, that's pretty freaking sad

1242
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:22,160
Because we saw all those people there, right

1243
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:29,200
But also, uh, I feel bad for the guy who really needed to go to the bathroom too

1244
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:31,200
Oh

1245
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:46,880
That person's stuck

1246
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,840

02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:05,040

God damn fuck

1317
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:29,840
I don't know if I can make it

1318
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:54,240
This thing fucking is too slow

1319
02:44:57,200 --> 02:44:59,200
I

1320
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:18,240
Great

1321
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:31,520
Nope fuck off. I don't want the opening anymore

1322
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:52,400
The last save was before the cultural festival

1323
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:59,600
I

1324
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:17,600
Before we got our money

1325
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:24,240
And before we click on the kid

1326
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:40,800
Okay, so before we get there

1327
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:46,480
There is

1328
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:51,520
They're going to be someone over here

1329
02:46:52,400 --> 02:47:01,120
And someone over here, I hope there's no one all the way over here

1330
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:06,720
My only thing is that I hope

1331
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:11,360
That they're not all the way around there because that's

1332
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:17,200
Gonna be really hard to navigate and the and the timing is really hard

1333
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:24,320
I

1334
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:34,960
Remember going over here only finding the person here anyone gonna be in like these areas

1335
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:55,760
Oh, we look through everything, right?

1336
02:47:55,760 --> 02:48:22,800
It's also harder. Hey, hold on. She gave me my money, right?

1337
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
I

1338
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:47,120
Don't like that

1339
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:50,640
It's timed even in the battles and the battles

1340
02:48:51,360 --> 02:48:52,800
have like

1341
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:55,120
The the they're they're like, you know

1342
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:03,680
Have they're like little victory animations that count it looks like

1343
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:07,440
I can't believe Rudy takes the time to pull them like stop

1344
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:25,760
I

1345
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:37,280
The black bars on top of the screen on purpose

1346
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:45,360
Well, not really but also I think it was a good size

1347
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:55,600
I

1348
02:50:01,280 --> 02:50:03,280
Mean like I can make it smaller

1349
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:10,640
Just the way that I I I made I framed it

1350
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:12,640
Oh

1351
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:24,160
Look it's just the way I framed it honestly

1352
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:33,680
Is it is it gonna be a problem if it's like if it's if it has these bars

1353
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:36,080
I

1354
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:44,480
Like if it bothers you that much I can just go like like that

1355
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:53,200
But I think uh, you'll you'll you'll miss a bit of the bottom part

1356
02:50:54,000 --> 02:51:04,320
The screen oh, yeah, oh, yeah, it's like that on my screen because it's uh

1357
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:09,120
It's ps2, right and I'm playing on a um

1358
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:12,720
Regular computer monitor

1359
02:51:24,160 --> 02:51:30,560
And not a well, you know what this was supposed to be played on

1360
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:43,520
Down the kid except for this time we save

1361
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:55,600
Oh

1362
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:01,920
Fucking kid ruining everything hold on

1363
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:09,200
No

1364
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:12,640
All right disaster kid, let's go

1365
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:25,520
You

1366
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:32,000
Why did this kid have to let go of this balloon you're so right you're so right senpai

1367
02:52:32,400 --> 02:52:34,400
I

1368
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:55,120
You guys don't need me to narrate this again, right?

1369
02:53:02,960 --> 02:53:07,840
I can't believe a balloon caused the apocalypse

1370
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:22,960
But we like your reading voice yeah, but I like saving everyone I guess

1371
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:42,960
I also don't like how Rudy's just smiling the entire time just like

1372
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:06,160
Oh my gosh, my disc is like making so many noises

1373
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:19,360
Ow, oh, thank you

1374
02:54:32,320 --> 02:54:34,320
Oh

1375
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:40,240
That's normal for ps2 okay first off

1376
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:45,760
Does anyone see anyone there

1377
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:51,760
Yes, there's a person over on that side

1378
02:55:02,320 --> 02:55:04,320
Oh

1379
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:18,880
Okay, we are scouting right now we are scouting

1380
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:27,360
Okay the person there

1381
02:55:27,680 --> 02:55:30,800
There's a person there

1382
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:44,960
Yeah, we didn't get the person last time

1383
02:55:45,280 --> 02:56:00,000
Yeah, the only place left to check is the one near Cecilia so we know which way we don't have to go

1384
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:09,120
Okay, we have the lady there

1385
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:17,840
Oh

1386
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:44,160
Bassist path would be to get the kid and

1387
02:56:45,360 --> 02:56:50,880
Hit the kid go behind the in and go to the other side run back grab the father

1388
02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:55,520
Grab the mayor and everyone else

1389
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:01,600
Then run back

1390
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,920
There's one person there

1391
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:25,680
I don't see a person there

1392
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:47,120
Oh

1393
02:57:52,480 --> 02:57:54,480
Hold on give me a second

02:57:55,120 --> 02:58:01,760
We're just gonna head to the back of that because I can't they suddenly decided to put a wall there. Thanks game

1395
02:58:14,960 --> 02:58:16,960
Oh

1396
02:58:38,880 --> 02:58:40,880
Hey, hold on

1397
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:44,560
Double make sure

1398
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:47,920
You

1399
02:58:50,880 --> 02:58:52,880
It's a very hard part

1400
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:59,200
Some pipes who play the original how did you did you have to do the same thing?

1401
02:59:14,960 --> 02:59:16,960
I

1402
02:59:20,560 --> 02:59:22,560
See a person

1403
02:59:26,240 --> 02:59:30,400
On the original yes, was it easier is this one you have to turn the camera on stuff

1404
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:47,120
You

1405
02:59:55,200 --> 02:59:57,200
Come on we're checking

1406
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:01,440
Nope, there's definitely nobody there

1407
03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:33,360
Okay, there's nobody there just one woman in the back. We're not good. We don't save the parrot screw that parrot

1408
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:44,080
Oh fuck I went the wrong way. This is what happens when it's just it's blurry

1409
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:47,200
So

1410
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:49,200
So

1411
03:01:12,880 --> 03:01:14,880
Okay

1412
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:21,280
I'm pretty sure I checked and there wasn't anyone on the other side either

1413
03:01:42,800 --> 03:01:44,960
The six I think so

1414
03:01:47,200 --> 03:01:49,520
I think it's just six

1415
03:02:17,440 --> 03:02:24,800
Wait, where's the timer? I haven't activated it yet senpai. I'm scouting right now

1416
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:32,960
Nobody

1417
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:41,440
I'm scouting so I make sure that I get everyone

1418
03:02:47,920 --> 03:02:49,920
So

1419
03:03:02,240 --> 03:03:07,600
Okay, I think it's easier to get the mayor

1420
03:03:09,680 --> 03:03:11,680
Get the mayor

1421
03:03:11,840 --> 03:03:13,840
run into the back

1422
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:20,880
Get the child get the father get the other lady and then run to um run to the castle

1423
03:03:35,360 --> 03:03:38,880
Front gate guy there's a guy at the what front gate guy

1424
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:47,440
Wait what guy at the front gate the mayor this is the mayor

1425
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:00,880
Oh, yeah, that's the further one

1426
03:04:03,280 --> 03:04:05,040
Yeah, the furthest one

1427
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:08,400
Is when we get the mayor then we grab all the girls from the back

1428
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:14,480
Run back get the kid get the father get the lady on the other side and get to the castle

1429
03:04:19,360 --> 03:04:21,360
That's that's my plan

1430
03:04:23,440 --> 03:04:26,960
Get the two ladies in the back including the one that's near the gate

1431
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:42,880
Right now, I'm just like at this point. I'm just grinding

1432
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:55,840
Okay

1433
03:04:55,840 --> 03:05:08,320
Okay, I think we're ready

1434
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:15,920
I think we're ready

1435
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:27,840
Oh

1436
03:05:33,280 --> 03:05:36,960
So the original was harder to save everyone because the monster could kill them before you get to them

1437
03:05:37,280 --> 03:05:41,360
Oh, shit. Okay, so that's their challenge. This one is the the camera challenge

1438
03:05:42,560 --> 03:05:44,560
That sucks

1439
03:05:56,720 --> 03:06:12,560
So, okay goal is mayor first then the ladies then the kid then the father then the other lady on the other side then run through

1440
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:22,480
I can't get over the fact that she's like get down

1441
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:27,840
Okay

1442
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:51,760
Okay, good thing. Okay fire still works on them. What the hell

1443
03:06:55,840 --> 03:06:57,840
Okay

1444
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:23,760
Okay

1445
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:28,160
All right

1446
03:07:30,320 --> 03:07:37,440
Oh, fuck I forgot to hit the button. Fuck I'm already feel like I'm failing

1447
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:57,840
Oh

1448
03:08:25,840 --> 03:08:27,840
Oh

1449
03:08:29,360 --> 03:08:35,360
Where is she wait, there's the other one fuck

Oh, I didn't realize she was below running all the way back here for nothing

1452
03:09:14,960 --> 03:09:16,960
The red ones you cannot escape from

1453
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:27,840
I

1454
03:09:46,960 --> 03:09:49,840

1461
03:11:20,240 --> 03:11:22,240

03:11:33,200 --> 03:11:35,200

1463
03:11:50,800 --> 03:11:58,400
I don't know how to get to her around the building I was just around the building

1464
03:12:05,040 --> 03:12:07,040
I didn't see her

1465
03:12:20,800 --> 03:12:23,760
What what do you mean she was already behind it and couldn't interact

1466
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:33,680
She just stuck there wait, I got it

1467
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:55,680
Dad and then the one lady at the back

1468
03:13:05,040 --> 03:13:07,040
No, we have one more lady at the back

1469
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:09,040
I

1470
03:13:16,160 --> 03:13:22,560
Just I lost where the fuck am I I lost time because I didn't know how to get to her

1471
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:33,680
Didn't get didn't know how to get to the lady at the bottom

1472
03:13:37,920 --> 03:13:39,920
I

1473
03:13:46,880 --> 03:13:50,320
Sorry I'm like super focused now

1474
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:52,320
Oh

1475
03:14:03,920 --> 03:14:06,480
On stupid fucking game

1476
03:14:16,480 --> 03:14:18,480
Stop posing

1477
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:23,040
I

1478
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:34,160
Right where is she there is she fuck talk

1479
03:14:50,400 --> 03:14:52,400
I

1480
03:15:03,280 --> 03:15:05,520
Please just talk thank you

1481
03:15:12,960 --> 03:15:14,960
I think that's it

1482
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:22,640
I

1483
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:28,960
Now I can skip

1484
03:15:30,720 --> 03:15:32,720
Probably

1485
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:35,680
I

1486
03:15:49,280 --> 03:15:51,280
Mean

1487
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:54,720
I think that's all the survivors there are

1488
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:05,600
I

1489
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:12,320
If there is a hidden one I will fucking cry

1490
03:16:14,640 --> 03:16:19,920
It's all weak and pathetic what happened to humans in the past thousand years they are simply no match for me

1491
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:31,520
My pre-imitative strike worked all too well there's no one left for me to kill

1492
03:16:32,720 --> 03:16:37,200
As opposed as just as well those weak humans would have been no challenge for me anyway

1493
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:40,640
Oh, thank goodness

1494
03:16:43,360 --> 03:16:47,120
You deliver my message to the survivors trembling inside their little castle

1495
03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:53,120
Tell them that if they fail to surrender the teardrop I would demolish the castle inside and out

1496
03:16:53,120 --> 03:16:55,120
What

1497
03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:07,760
What golems in the castle they've been mobilized what not operational fool

1498
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:12,800
Oh, you just killed

1499
03:17:15,760 --> 03:17:20,320
How dare you bring me a false alarm active golems would be a force to be reckoned with

1500
03:17:21,120 --> 03:17:28,720
Hey, wait a minute get interesting golems are once the pride of fugaia. It's only true defense

1501
03:17:29,280 --> 03:17:31,280
I could take control of them

1502
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:41,520
Going front of the way I say reckoned with

1503
03:17:42,480 --> 03:17:44,480
Whacking with

1504
03:17:45,440 --> 03:17:48,640
I failed to see this coming. I am solely

1505
03:17:49,440 --> 03:17:52,400
Soarly wounded my people needed me the most

1506
03:17:53,760 --> 03:17:57,360
Have citizens of idahide successfully taken cover

1507
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:04,560
They speak to Cecilia there's something I must tower at once

1508
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:13,280
Cecilia it's a relief to know that you have survived during the time of chaos

1509
03:18:14,800 --> 03:18:20,080
Listen to me very carefully Cecilia. I'm afraid that the demons are after you do not surrender to them

1510
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:24,240
To me why what do they want?

1511
03:18:24,480 --> 03:18:26,480
I

1512
03:18:30,640 --> 03:18:37,600
Sire begging your pardon sire demons are tearing through the town they demand that their requests be heard

1513
03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:42,400
Continue

1514
03:18:42,400 --> 03:18:47,920
Yes sire the demons say they will leave in peace or you must surrender the teardrop. What should we do?

1515
03:18:49,520 --> 03:18:51,520
The teardrop

1516
03:18:52,160 --> 03:18:55,440
Teardrop is only a memento of my late mother my mother

1517
03:18:56,480 --> 03:18:58,320
It's not only a

1518
03:18:58,320 --> 03:19:00,320
memento of my late mother, but also a

1519
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:06,000
Or I cannot possibly jeopardize the many lives those who have taken refuge here in the castle

1520
03:19:11,200 --> 03:19:15,920
All right, then I will surrender the teardrop to the demons personally

1521
03:19:16,800 --> 03:19:18,800
No, you must not do that

1522
03:19:19,280 --> 03:19:21,280
Cecilia the teardrop

1523
03:19:21,280 --> 03:19:23,280
And handed down generations

1524
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:28,320
Is the key to unlocking all the secrets of the universe including those of philgaia

1525
03:19:29,280 --> 03:19:33,280
Can only be used by those who carry the will of the guardians a shrine maiden

1526
03:19:34,720 --> 03:19:40,080
The key which can change the fate of the world must not fall into the hands of demons at any cost

1527
03:19:40,160 --> 03:19:46,000
And we are left with no choice the witness will useless bloodshed sadness and lives lost

1528
03:19:47,360 --> 03:19:49,360
These understands Cecilia

1529
03:19:49,360 --> 03:19:52,000
Sometimes a noble let's make a difficult choice

1530
03:19:53,120 --> 03:19:57,280
Whatever happens next you are not to leave here not even one step

1531
03:20:10,640 --> 03:20:16,160
Father has asked for forgiveness, but I believe it is wrong to do nothing while innocent people are hurt

1532
03:20:17,840 --> 03:20:21,280
Osma he knows of a secret passage that leads into town

1533
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:27,680
He used it to take me through used to take me through the passage whenever I would cry from the boredom of being in the castle

1534
03:20:30,240 --> 03:20:33,360
We should hand over the teardrop believe that is my duty

1535
03:20:40,560 --> 03:20:43,760
I have a pretty good idea of who's behind this cowardly sneak attack

1536
03:20:44,480 --> 03:20:50,160
I'll accompany you as far as needed to take down these demons. I also want nothing to do with the teardrop

1537
03:20:53,280 --> 03:20:55,280
Understand

1538
03:20:57,680 --> 03:21:00,320
Can I have a parrot thank you

1539
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:05,760
Greetings I record the princess's progress. Should I record your progress too?

1540
03:21:06,480 --> 03:21:08,480
Yeah

1541
03:21:10,480 --> 03:21:12,480
Yeah

1542
03:21:23,360 --> 03:21:25,360
There thank goodness there's a save

1543
03:21:29,280 --> 03:21:34,320
All the furniture spotless as well a pointed room and it lacks a welcoming atmosphere

1544
03:21:35,760 --> 03:21:37,760
Look there. Can I read the book?

1545
03:21:40,080 --> 03:21:41,760
It's like wow

1546
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:45,440
We'll kill everyone if you don't give this to us now me exploring

1547
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:53,440
Within this pristine room it appears children were entertained with a lovely puppet show each puppet has goda

1548
03:21:54,320 --> 03:21:57,040
And wears fine clothes with corresponding animal patterns

1549
03:22:00,480 --> 03:22:03,680
The book is titled the brightness of life do you want to read it? Yeah

1550
03:22:04,320 --> 03:22:10,160
The teardrop is the out of hide family treasure is known to hold one unique of the quality

1551
03:22:10,720 --> 03:22:12,720
If you focus your eyes on the teardrop

1552
03:22:13,600 --> 03:22:16,000
You will notice blinking lights at his core

1553
03:22:16,640 --> 03:22:19,040
A blinking rhythm is much like your own heartbeat

1554
03:22:19,680 --> 03:22:22,240
Because the teardrop is said to be created by the elu

1555
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:29,760
The elu elu elu elu right may have a connection with the world

1556
03:22:30,720 --> 03:22:36,160
Studies needed to verify the former statement. However, no one can deny the beauty and brightness of the teardrop

1557
03:22:41,360 --> 03:22:46,560
Elu elu elu arses

1558
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:54,000
Whoa

1559
03:23:00,320 --> 03:23:02,320
Oh

1560
03:23:05,200 --> 03:23:07,200
Let's start

1561
03:23:15,040 --> 03:23:18,240
Please stay in the room we cannot afford to make any more careless mistakes

1562
03:23:25,280 --> 03:23:28,400
Oh, I think oh we can move it understood

1563
03:23:29,760 --> 03:23:31,760
Oh

1564
03:24:00,720 --> 03:24:02,720
I

1565
03:24:05,840 --> 03:24:12,880
Just want to look at stuff these signs of tension coming from the king's bedroom advisable not to step in right now

1566
03:24:26,320 --> 03:24:28,320
Okay, let's see

1567
03:24:29,920 --> 03:24:37,920
Titled awaken machines. You want to read it? Yeah lore arms have been uncovered all throughout folgaia and still hold many mysteries

1568
03:24:38,560 --> 03:24:43,920
Modern anthropologists believe arm is an acronym ancient relic machines

1569
03:24:44,800 --> 03:24:46,800
Oh that felt like it was kind of forced

1570
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:54,800
Literally a machine constructed from ancient relics

1571
03:24:56,320 --> 03:24:59,040
Some say that arm needs something completely different

1572
03:24:59,760 --> 03:25:03,520
Perhaps one day a scientist's passion will solve a thousand-year-old riddle

1573
03:25:08,480 --> 03:25:12,160
The book is titled surviving royal family you want to read it? Yeah

1574
03:25:13,360 --> 03:25:19,280
There was a group called the council of seven which led the civilians to unite and survive the great demon war

1575
03:25:20,480 --> 03:25:22,480
current nobility are

1576
03:25:22,480 --> 03:25:26,240
The descendants of those who were elected by a public election

1577
03:25:27,200 --> 03:25:29,200
There used to be seven royal family

1578
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:35,680
The committee also had seven members, but after a period of thousand years it has become too normal

1579
03:25:36,880 --> 03:25:38,320
noble families

1580
03:25:38,320 --> 03:25:40,320
There are out of height and arktika

1581
03:25:41,440 --> 03:25:43,440
And only descendants of this

1582
03:25:43,440 --> 03:25:45,440
The only descendants of the council of seven

1583
03:25:46,400 --> 03:25:49,360
They are both influenced by the elu skills

1584
03:25:49,760 --> 03:25:53,440
Out of height worships the guardian and tends to coexist with nature

1585
03:25:54,160 --> 03:25:59,920
Arktika on the other hand emphasizes the preservation of the elu's alchemy techniques for human restoration

1586
03:26:00,880 --> 03:26:06,320
There are two different families, but both have the same goal to bring peace back to folgaia

1587
03:26:11,120 --> 03:26:15,120
I think I I think that was the same one. Yeah

1588
03:26:15,520 --> 03:26:17,520
Same

1589
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:20,720
Hi book is titled a virtue of the royal family

1590
03:26:21,360 --> 03:26:28,960
Yeah, let's read it first protect the civilians second always take initiative and lastly be honest and trustworthy

1591
03:26:29,840 --> 03:26:31,840
Yeah, we're gonna protect this

1592
03:26:31,920 --> 03:26:38,640
Billion the royalty shall not be above civilians, but rather become part of them form a strong foundation

1593
03:26:39,360 --> 03:26:46,320
The royal family shall not exploit civil civilians or they provide for us to die before civilians

1594
03:26:47,760 --> 03:26:49,760
That's why she wants to be like

1595
03:26:50,080 --> 03:26:52,080
now

1596
03:26:58,320 --> 03:27:00,880
Book is titled ancient android weapons

1597
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:10,560
According to the legend a massive weapon was created by men during the great demon war of a thousand years ago

1598
03:27:11,360 --> 03:27:12,960
their golems

1599
03:27:12,960 --> 03:27:16,880
Most of the eight members force are said to lie dormant in ruins

1600
03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:22,320
The study of ancient history will progress once all eight golems are discovered

1601
03:27:23,440 --> 03:27:27,760
I believe we must first understand ancient history before we encounter the golems

1602
03:27:28,480 --> 03:27:32,400
We need to first know the magnitude of their power and what they did to the world

1603
03:27:38,560 --> 03:27:40,560
Are you at this one already it's the same one, right?

1604
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:49,520

1605
03:27:50,480 --> 03:27:52,480

1606
03:27:56,880 --> 03:28:04,480
Don't know I feel like that's really nice of a if an ancient if the role of royalty princess, what are you doing?

1608
03:28:08,720 --> 03:28:10,720
Oops

1611
03:28:49,680 --> 03:28:51,680

1612
03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:54,560

1613
03:28:55,520 --> 03:28:57,520
I

1614
03:29:17,120 --> 03:29:19,920
Don't come in here. We are enforcing tight security. Please stay put

1615
03:29:25,360 --> 03:29:33,280
The motion sickness okay with the camera sometimes does not sometimes it is

1616
03:29:43,840 --> 03:29:45,840
How do you like get out of here?

1617
03:29:54,800 --> 03:29:59,920

03:30:16,480 --> 03:30:18,480
Oh, I'm getting a bit dizzy

1619
03:30:24,560 --> 03:30:31,360
Hey, no get out of here. Uh-huh. I'll have to hear from my boss

1620
03:30:35,840 --> 03:30:39,440
I'm thinking something quick those diligent soldiers are just gonna make us go back

1621
03:30:40,720 --> 03:30:43,220
Think of the way to distract the soldiers

1622
03:30:54,880 --> 03:30:57,360
Like throw a bomb

1623
03:30:59,760 --> 03:31:01,760
Hampton

1624
03:31:14,320 --> 03:31:16,320

This is what I can I do for you Osma. Would you do me a favor?

1672
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:20,240
I need to know the secret path to the castle town

I must go into town and hand over the teardrop to prevent any more bloodshed

1674
03:37:26,160 --> 03:37:27,600
princess

1675
03:37:27,600 --> 03:37:29,760
Royalty should not act from emotion

1676
03:37:30,720 --> 03:37:33,920
A frantic action may now jeopardize our entire future

1677
03:37:34,560 --> 03:37:37,120
I understand the painful consequence of what you're about to do

1678
03:37:38,400 --> 03:37:39,680

I'll tell you all I know about the secret path

1684
03:37:57,600 --> 03:38:01,360
Once you proceed up the staircase of the audience chamber in the hall

1685
03:38:03,600 --> 03:38:06,800
You will see two horse statues check their pedestal

1686
03:38:07,520 --> 03:38:09,520
One will respond to the shield badge

1687
03:38:10,160 --> 03:38:12,640
And you will see the old secret path into town

1688
03:38:14,640 --> 03:38:17,120
Thank you, Osma. I understand this is tough for you to do

1689
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:22,880
Don't mention it. I'm honored to be of any help. This one has to take to ask me anything

1690
03:38:26,320 --> 03:38:28,320
Girls again

1691
03:38:29,920 --> 03:38:35,440
The underground path into town is a complex maze designed to confuse the monsters please look after the princess

1692
03:38:37,440 --> 03:38:39,440
You

1693
03:38:43,680 --> 03:38:49,280
You will see two horse statues once you are in the hall from the staircase in the audience chamber

1694
03:38:54,240 --> 03:38:56,240
Audience chamber

1695
03:38:56,480 --> 03:39:07,200
This one but staircases, right?

1696
03:39:10,480 --> 03:39:12,480

1697
03:39:26,240 --> 03:39:28,240
I

1698
03:39:35,280 --> 03:39:37,280

1704
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:03,040
This one

1705
03:40:10,720 --> 03:40:12,720
I think back to when we scared the guards

1706
03:40:21,840 --> 03:40:23,840
The two horse statues those ones

1707
03:40:26,560 --> 03:40:28,560
So

1708
03:40:31,600 --> 03:40:33,600
Are you gonna distract them again?

Someone's gonna be like why the heck is why isn't making so many sounds

1740
03:45:29,840 --> 03:45:32,800
Someone's gonna be like what the hell is that? What are those tremors?

1741
03:45:36,400 --> 03:45:42,000
That's x when the characters under wire netting to jump up and grab it when hanging move the character with the

Circle to jump off move the character to the edge while hanging press x to flip the character to the top of the netting

1784
03:52:17,520 --> 03:52:19,520

At long last my weight is over now give me the teardrop

1786

Do you promise to leave the humans alone once I give you the teardrop

1787
03:52:38,320 --> 03:52:41,440
Of course I have better things than to slaughter the helpless

1788
03:52:46,480 --> 03:52:49,360
Thus as long as I can save everyone

1789
03:52:52,480 --> 03:52:55,360
Finally it always feels great to finish a job

1790
03:52:55,840 --> 03:52:59,200

1791
03:53:00,400 --> 03:53:02,400

1792
03:53:04,160 --> 03:53:06,160
Ha ha ha ha

03:53:07,680 --> 03:53:10,560
We are withdrawing as soon as the gate is open. Don't forget the teardrop

1794
03:53:12,640 --> 03:53:16,720
Wait wait, I'm not through with you yet

What who's this

1796
03:53:21,520 --> 03:53:27,360
I'm not from this town. I'm not from this town. So you're not part of that agreement

1797
03:53:28,880 --> 03:53:31,200
You are the legendary invaders right demons

1798
03:53:32,560 --> 03:53:35,840
Of course we are demons. Why what difference does it make to you?

1799
03:53:37,440 --> 03:53:39,920
Avenge I have waited a long time to see this day

It pleases me to see such a spirit in the human very well come try to take your revenge

1803
03:53:57,280 --> 03:53:59,280
It's just gone

1804
03:53:59,600 --> 03:54:04,320
It sounds so corny now. It's gone the acting gone. I don't even know her anymore

1805
03:54:05,840 --> 03:54:07,840
I hope you know what you're doing

1806
03:54:08,400 --> 03:54:10,960
No, I hope he knows what he's doing at all

1807
03:54:15,760 --> 03:54:20,640
Don't worry, I won't go easy on you. I don't want to finish this too quickly

He's got nice legs look at him wearing the yoga pants

1814
03:54:51,520 --> 03:54:55,120
I remember this power. Don't forget it even after a thousand years

1815
03:54:56,320 --> 03:55:00,720
It's exciting to know that we have the same strength. Show me what you can do with the arm

1816
03:55:00,960 --> 03:55:02,960
Oh

1817
03:55:08,720 --> 03:55:10,720
He missed at least

1818
03:55:16,320 --> 03:55:19,040
Oh good, he's weak to lightning. That's fantastic

1819
03:55:31,680 --> 03:55:33,680
Even better than I thought

1820
03:55:42,160 --> 03:55:44,160
I give him a boost to chill later

1821
03:56:00,720 --> 03:56:05,760
Oh good to know that he's weak to lightning though

1822
03:56:30,720 --> 03:56:32,720

So bright

1835
03:58:27,760 --> 03:58:32,160
I was hoping to keep myself busy until I would departure a few humans are just too weak

1836
03:58:32,880 --> 03:58:37,920
Have you lost all your aggressiveness? Have you lost your will to fight or just no match for me?

1837
03:58:37,920 --> 03:58:39,920
Nice

1838

Nice

1840
03:58:55,920 --> 03:58:57,920
Nice

1841
03:58:59,200 --> 03:59:01,200
Nice

1842
03:59:08,640 --> 03:59:12,800
Nice that was a lot of leveling

1843
03:59:21,280 --> 03:59:23,840
Too bad humans you're not even worth my strike

1844
03:59:26,560 --> 03:59:32,080
And the shame for me to not have any time to play with you humans

1845
03:59:32,080 --> 03:59:34,080
I

1846
03:59:40,160 --> 03:59:42,160
Want the fight for lost in the cutscene

1847
03:59:42,640 --> 03:59:45,680
I don't care if it's revenge or not. Just promise me that you

1848
03:59:46,400 --> 03:59:49,840

1851
04:00:00,960 --> 04:00:02,960
Losers

04:00:05,760 --> 04:00:07,760
Oh, it's bright

1853
04:00:11,600 --> 04:00:19,360
He killed everyone the exhibition menu. No, no even the golems

1854
04:00:22,800 --> 04:00:26,800
Goodbye go go pal wangers wait, what's falling?

1855
04:00:26,800 --> 04:00:32,400
Is it the card card one? No

1856
04:00:36,640 --> 04:00:40,720
Hey jack, maybe if you weren't such a little bitch we wouldn't have this issue

1857
04:00:45,280 --> 04:00:49,200
Sorry berserk was here jack is a loser

1858
04:00:57,520 --> 04:00:59,920
I'm so sorry father

1859
04:01:01,600 --> 04:01:06,720
Against your wishes against your wishes. I've given the teardrop to the demons

1860
04:01:09,200 --> 04:01:13,440
What's done is done cannot blame me for it did what you thought was best

1861
04:01:15,040 --> 04:01:22,960
The problem still lies before us the demon will misuse the teardrop must stop them before these do not

1862
04:01:23,520 --> 04:01:29,840
Do wait, please don't do no more father. I'll only hurt me more

1863
04:01:30,720 --> 04:01:32,720
I'll take fuller responsibility

1864
04:01:32,720 --> 04:01:34,320
However, the teardrop

1865
04:01:34,320 --> 04:01:36,320
Please rest for now

1866
04:01:42,960 --> 04:01:49,280
Uh, to be honest, I don't think that was her fault. I personally think that was jack's fault

1867
04:01:53,040 --> 04:01:55,040
I think that was jack's fault

1868
04:02:01,200 --> 04:02:04,000
Jack just really wanted his revenge and was like

1869
04:02:07,760 --> 04:02:11,200
And also the fucking balloon what was in that fucking thing?

1870
04:02:16,960 --> 04:02:22,880
Personally, I think that Cecilia was in the right I think lives are more important

1871
04:02:23,920 --> 04:02:25,920
I

1872
04:02:28,880 --> 04:02:30,880
That's my own opinion though

1873
04:02:38,800 --> 04:02:47,040
Honestly, we can blame it all on the kid or at least that balloon whoever sold that balloon who manufactured that balloon all their fault

1874
04:02:48,960 --> 04:02:51,360
The air in that balloon them too

1875
04:02:53,200 --> 04:02:55,200
The

1876
04:03:00,960 --> 04:03:04,800
String where where did the string come from? Yeah, that's their fault too

1877
04:03:10,640 --> 04:03:13,200
The string the air

1878
04:03:14,880 --> 04:03:19,760
The the helium all of it the manufacturer the seller

1879
04:03:20,720 --> 04:03:22,720
You know

1880
04:03:23,120 --> 04:03:29,440
The responsibility of the manufacturer to keep quality control clearly this one didn't

1881
04:03:38,640 --> 04:03:42,640
No princess you're not to leave the castle our nice will recover the teardrop

1882
04:03:44,080 --> 04:03:46,560
I have decided I will go myself

1883
04:03:47,200 --> 04:03:54,720
We need to use the knights and the national treasury to rebuild how to hide

1884
04:03:55,840 --> 04:04:00,320
It would not be efficient to use knights to retrieve the teardrop

1885
04:04:01,680 --> 04:04:03,680
That is why I'm going

1886
04:04:03,840 --> 04:04:05,840
My duty

1887
04:04:06,800 --> 04:04:08,800
It's us

1888
04:04:09,920 --> 04:04:14,160
Don't worry Johan Johan Johan Johan, that's how you pronounce it, right?

1889
04:04:15,120 --> 04:04:16,480
I

1890
04:04:16,480 --> 04:04:18,640
Can make Jack do it a little bitch

1891
04:04:19,120 --> 04:04:26,000
They were just gonna leave in peace and then and then you know, they were like, uh, you know what fuck this shit

1892
04:04:28,720 --> 04:04:31,520
I will not be alone. I have a strong team with me

1893
04:04:33,520 --> 04:04:38,660
Their help I'm sure I can return the teardrops too safely

1894
04:04:39,380 --> 04:04:41,380
I

1895
04:04:42,980 --> 04:04:47,700
Got on I got a hang nail. I got to cut it. I got to cut this hang nail

1896
04:04:48,900 --> 04:04:50,900
It's bothering me senpai

1897
04:04:52,820 --> 04:04:56,820
This emotional scene and all I can think about is how annoying this hang nail is

1898
04:05:08,660 --> 04:05:21,460
I'm trying to like get the hang now. It's really hard

1899
04:05:21,460 --> 04:05:23,460
I

1900
04:05:36,500 --> 04:05:44,820
Think I'm having more difficulties with the hang nails because my my my nail cutters have like a curve to them

1901
04:05:52,420 --> 04:05:54,420
So

1902
04:06:14,020 --> 04:06:18,260
Anyways hang nail probably good enough bite it off that's

1903
04:06:19,220 --> 04:06:21,220
No, what do you think I am

1904
04:06:23,620 --> 04:06:30,020
That makes the hang nail more likely to tear and cause more pain come on, you know better than that

1905
04:06:33,380 --> 04:06:36,260
Don't eat my hang nail what's wrong with you

1906
04:06:36,260 --> 04:06:38,260
You

1907
04:06:45,060 --> 04:06:49,620
Senpai come on, you know better, you know better than the bite hang nails

1908
04:06:53,060 --> 04:07:00,900
Tearing them will cause the skin irritation and thus cause you to have the little pain and it'll be really really really really really really painful

1909
04:07:01,060 --> 04:07:07,700
That's how I always get rid of them and you always get those little cuts that hurt really really

1910
04:07:08,420 --> 04:07:11,060
Like a lot more and you're like man, I should have cut it better, right?

1911
04:07:12,820 --> 04:07:17,220
Maybe we have nail clippers in our cages. I sometimes provide them once a week

1912
04:07:23,860 --> 04:07:25,860
Just once a week though

1913
04:07:26,580 --> 04:07:28,580
I'll live with my mistakes. Yeah. Yeah

1914
04:07:29,300 --> 04:07:31,300
Uh-huh, uh-huh

1915
04:07:32,980 --> 04:07:37,140
I'll give you guys all nail clippers once a week to get rid of your in hang nails

1916
04:07:44,100 --> 04:07:47,940
Anyways beauty jack, please let me hear aid

1917
04:07:48,820 --> 04:07:54,020
So we can prevent the teardrop from being misused by the demons. This is for all of fagaya

1918
04:07:58,980 --> 04:08:04,260
You got it princess you will help them

1919
04:08:06,020 --> 04:08:12,980
I'm sure Rudy's with us too. I feel like I should be the one asking for help. I'm after the demons just as much as you are

1920
04:08:17,140 --> 04:08:20,900
But I don't think you should come princess won't be a walk in the park

1921
04:08:22,580 --> 04:08:24,580
No, but

1922
04:08:25,380 --> 04:08:28,340
I would not have teamed up with you if I knew you were the princess

1923
04:08:29,540 --> 04:08:31,540
I do not trust nobles

1924
04:08:32,580 --> 04:08:34,580
I never have

1925
04:08:35,460 --> 04:08:40,660
And I never will jack what the fuck stop being a little bitch

1926
04:08:41,620 --> 04:08:57,700
Yeah, why the fuck are you so mean she's like hello, she was really strong

1927
04:09:03,860 --> 04:09:06,660
I grew suspicious from the way people treat you at the castle

1928
04:09:06,740 --> 04:09:09,380
You never seem to want to review your true identity

1929
04:09:09,940 --> 04:09:14,260
This may be all fun and games to you, but for me, it's deadly serious. Take your game somewhere else

1930
04:09:17,700 --> 04:09:22,740
She's she's she wants the the teardrop back. I don't think that's fun and games

1931
04:09:24,660 --> 04:09:28,980
She also wanted to save the people from dying. I don't think that's fun and games my dude

1932
04:09:30,820 --> 04:09:32,820
My dude

1933
04:09:33,780 --> 04:09:35,780
I

1934
04:09:36,580 --> 04:09:41,780
Game she like fall right beside you like I know she's a noble but like

1935
04:09:44,260 --> 04:09:51,860
Frankly to say it she has heel and she has like, you know thunder and fire, which is pretty a fucking effective

1936
04:09:57,540 --> 04:10:02,660
And I'm like jack you have hit hit and hit

1937
04:10:03,780 --> 04:10:05,780
And the cute little rat

1938
04:10:08,900 --> 04:10:10,900
Like dude you need the heels

1939
04:10:18,740 --> 04:10:23,220
Is as jack the the the guy who's like at the very beginning where he's like no

1940
04:10:23,220 --> 04:10:25,220
No

1941
04:10:30,580 --> 04:10:32,740
Enough mind your tongue wanderer

1942
04:10:35,780 --> 04:10:37,780
It's okay, Johan

1943
04:10:38,500 --> 04:10:41,140
Jack I apologize for concealing my identity

1944
04:10:41,780 --> 04:10:45,620
I was afraid of creating any unwanted tension once I revealed my true self

1945
04:10:46,500 --> 04:10:48,500
Because it's always been that way

1946
04:10:49,060 --> 04:10:53,220
However, please know that my willingness to protect the guy is sincere

1947
04:10:55,140 --> 04:10:57,140
And Rudy's just like

1948
04:11:08,980 --> 04:11:10,980
What can I do to convince you?

1949
04:11:11,460 --> 04:11:17,860
Oh Cecilia our fagaya

1950
04:11:27,140 --> 04:11:29,300
Your sword please lend me your sword

1951
04:11:30,980 --> 04:11:34,420
I don't know what you're playing at but my sword's not a toy. I will not

1952
04:11:35,460 --> 04:11:37,460
Hand me your sword right now

04:11:38,420 --> 04:11:41,220
Wow just twice, huh?

04:11:43,060 --> 04:11:45,060
Heavier than it look

1955
04:11:45,940 --> 04:11:47,940
Sword is heavy as its fate

1956
04:11:53,380 --> 04:11:57,700
Like he's just there Rudy's just like, okay

1957
04:11:59,060 --> 04:12:01,060
Cool

1958
04:12:01,300 --> 04:12:08,820
Give me back the sword. It's obviously too heavy for you. You can't possibly carry it

1959
04:12:10,900 --> 04:12:12,900
Stab him

1960
04:12:19,860 --> 04:12:21,860
She cut her hair

1961
04:12:24,260 --> 04:12:28,580
Thank you. I thank you for all you have done for me with your sword

1962
04:12:29,060 --> 04:12:35,780

You're truly determined. There's no turning back. Wait, how did that convince you?

1966
04:12:52,740 --> 04:12:54,740
Sorry

1967
04:13:05,060 --> 04:13:09,380

1968
04:13:09,380 --> 04:13:11,380

Oh

1976
04:14:16,660 --> 04:14:18,660
Oh

1977
04:14:36,980 --> 04:14:39,700
This makes it worse. Oh the screen shaking

1978
04:14:40,660 --> 04:14:42,660
Oh the filter shaking

1979
04:14:42,660 --> 04:14:44,660
Being 17 years of age

1980
04:14:45,060 --> 04:14:52,020
Just a longer a child. He is now an adult. No, that makes the phrasing worse

1981
04:15:02,020 --> 04:15:04,020
Why it's it's so shaky

1982
04:15:04,180 --> 04:15:10,740
Weed the survivor shall prepare a funeral for all who have died in this catastrophe noble citizen life

1983
04:15:13,060 --> 04:15:15,060
Yes, that part, huh

1984
04:15:17,700 --> 04:15:20,980
You you're 17 now embrace them with love

1985
04:15:22,340 --> 04:15:24,340
No

1986
04:15:24,340 --> 04:15:35,300
I can't believe it's losing it wait, why didn't you get funeral attire?

1987
04:15:55,140 --> 04:15:57,140
Got you angle

1988
04:15:58,420 --> 04:16:03,620
Can't believe we just died. I guess it was just like

1989
04:16:05,700 --> 04:16:07,700
Go fudge

1990
04:16:08,820 --> 04:16:10,980
And then went peace

1991
04:16:13,060 --> 04:16:15,060
Those were his last words

1992
04:16:24,340 --> 04:16:30,260
I can't believe those were his last words

1993
04:16:54,980 --> 04:16:57,540
Look at this child with their hair vents to breathe

1994
04:17:11,060 --> 04:17:19,140
Also, I was like and that that that ball was definitely supposed to be like the like the like the balloon

1995
04:17:24,340 --> 04:17:26,340
So

1996
04:17:55,220 --> 04:17:59,780
Oh, yeah, how did the tomb get rebuilt with the stained glass and everything?

1997
04:17:59,780 --> 04:18:01,780
Oh

1998
04:18:22,980 --> 04:18:24,980
All right

1999
04:18:30,340 --> 04:18:32,340
Here we go

2000
04:18:34,660 --> 04:18:36,660
Wait

2001
04:18:40,340 --> 04:18:46,180
Now what there we go one week after the attack

2002
04:18:52,500 --> 04:18:55,460
The three of us randomly got together searching for

2003
04:18:55,940 --> 04:19:03,620
Lalithia's coffin or now chasing after demons. I don't want to sound philosophical, but it feels like faith

2004
04:19:05,460 --> 04:19:09,860
Anyway, Rudy it doesn't seem to be much in it for you. Okay with all of this

2005
04:19:10,660 --> 04:19:12,660
I

2006
04:19:15,220 --> 04:19:17,220
Offer the ball wait

2007
04:19:25,060 --> 04:19:27,060
Anyway, I'm a little concerned about the princess

2008
04:19:27,940 --> 04:19:39,460
He's been so busy with the uh national funeral and planning the restoration

2009
04:19:40,100 --> 04:19:42,100
Distracts her from the paying of loss

2010
04:19:42,580 --> 04:19:44,180
but

2011
04:19:44,180 --> 04:19:47,220
Yeah, I talked too much. Yeah, shut the fuck up

2012
04:19:53,940 --> 04:19:56,180
Go get the princess we have a ton of things to do

2013
04:19:57,620 --> 04:19:59,620
You

2014
04:20:09,220 --> 04:20:11,220
Hey, I was looking for you

2015
04:20:12,260 --> 04:20:16,660
Minister of state y'all y'all hand wishes to see you right now before you continue with your dirt

2016
04:20:17,300 --> 04:20:22,660
With your journey the minister is in the audience chamber past the entrance to the castle. Please hurry

2017
04:20:24,900 --> 04:20:26,900
Peace away

2018
04:20:27,700 --> 04:20:29,700
You

2019
04:20:33,940 --> 04:20:35,940
This one

2020
04:20:49,140 --> 04:20:51,540
That's the king's bedroom I totally forgot

2021
04:20:51,540 --> 04:20:57,460
It looks like they posted a night

2022
04:21:01,460 --> 04:21:06,020
Hey, cool. Hi. I'm feeling kind of thirsty. Do you know anywhere I can get something hydrating and energy?

2023
04:21:06,900 --> 04:21:13,780
Sing well then my dear senpai. Have you heard of gamer sups? I'm currently

2024
04:21:14,740 --> 04:21:21,220
Affiliated with gamer sups your gaming energy drink in a powder form

2025
04:21:27,940 --> 04:21:38,340
Use cold mercy for 10 off and you and with enough colds we can get a waifu cup or an exclusive flavor

2026
04:21:44,660 --> 04:21:46,660
Oh

2027
04:21:55,060 --> 04:21:57,060
Wait, there he is

2028
04:22:02,020 --> 04:22:06,100
How many goes into the waifu cup I don't know a lot but

2029
04:22:08,420 --> 04:22:10,420
I know a lot of my friends

2030
04:22:10,820 --> 04:22:12,100
really like

2031
04:22:12,100 --> 04:22:14,100
Um gamer sups

2032
04:22:15,220 --> 04:22:19,540
So I can vouch for that. It'll be my first time trying gamer sups myself

2033
04:22:25,780 --> 04:22:32,260
But like I was looking at like the ingredients they have so many like vitamins and stuff. I was like dang

2034
04:22:33,140 --> 04:22:34,100
I'm

2035
04:22:34,100 --> 04:22:36,100
Technically it's all soluble

2036
04:22:36,900 --> 04:22:39,060
So the excess would just get you know

2037
04:22:40,020 --> 04:22:42,020
out

2038
04:22:46,500 --> 04:22:48,500
Would just get pitched out

2039
04:22:53,060 --> 04:22:56,180
I heard they gave you lean in the package the flavor is so good really

2040
04:22:56,820 --> 04:23:01,380
Yeah, I I saw that they they they gave all of us lean

2041
04:23:09,780 --> 04:23:11,780
I

2042
04:23:17,460 --> 04:23:19,460
Gave lean and

2043
04:23:20,500 --> 04:23:22,020
Uh

2044
04:23:22,020 --> 04:23:25,300
And they also provided a a shaker cup a waifu cup

2045
04:23:26,900 --> 04:23:28,900
so

2046
04:23:29,460 --> 04:23:34,100
I'm helping I'm helping I can try out all ma'am flavors

2047
04:23:39,060 --> 04:23:41,060
Welcome you to let's cut to the chase

2048
04:23:42,980 --> 04:23:50,420
And get right to business a task the princess received from the guardian is to stop the demons by uniting the power of all the guardians

2049
04:23:54,740 --> 04:23:58,660
I have they also have a flavor that I'm very interested in

2050
04:23:59,540 --> 04:24:02,420
That they sent me because I'm getting a pr package

2051
04:24:03,620 --> 04:24:05,620
It's called

2052
04:24:05,780 --> 04:24:07,780
Uh

2053
04:24:08,020 --> 04:24:10,020
It's called uh

2054
04:24:12,580 --> 04:24:14,580
Gamer farts

2055
04:24:20,980 --> 04:24:24,340
Gamer farts, I don't know how that's gonna taste though

2056
04:24:36,340 --> 04:24:38,340
Yeah, that's the flavor

2057
04:24:44,500 --> 04:24:51,380
Honestly, I think the one I think uh the one that I was most interested in

2058
04:24:52,260 --> 04:24:54,260
was

2059
04:24:55,620 --> 04:24:57,620
The tea one

2060
04:24:59,300 --> 04:25:03,460
Cahol's quality I think I think it was quality

2061
04:25:04,180 --> 04:25:06,180
It sounded good

2062
04:25:06,740 --> 04:25:11,860
But this is also gonna be my first time trying like energy drinks in a powder form

2063
04:25:11,860 --> 04:25:14,340
So I have no idea how that's gonna work out

2064
04:25:15,860 --> 04:25:19,620
I've only tried like some monsters, but that's it

2065
04:25:21,780 --> 04:25:27,620
Lean is tea flavor too like peach tea. Oh, I like peach and I like tea. Yeah, I like tea

2066
04:25:28,580 --> 04:25:30,580
Don't

2067
04:25:31,300 --> 04:25:38,740
Overdose kohai don't they have like measuring stuff and I have measuring spoons. So I I should I shouldn't

2068
04:25:39,860 --> 04:25:44,020
Overdose probably anything. I'll probably do something a little less

2069
04:25:46,980 --> 04:25:48,980
Oh

2070
04:25:57,780 --> 04:26:01,620
Yeah, they have measuring scoops. You don't need much powder. I'll probably do like half of the

2071
04:26:03,060 --> 04:26:05,700
The the the scoop the scoop

2072
04:26:09,220 --> 04:26:14,100
I mean like to be honest like monster is pretty expensive if if like

2073
04:26:15,940 --> 04:26:19,620
I can have something similar to that but

2074
04:26:22,500 --> 04:26:26,420
For like way less it sounds like a good deal right like I think I think it was

2075
04:26:27,780 --> 04:26:33,140
I think one tub is like a hundred and a hundred servings. That's pretty good

2076
04:26:40,420 --> 04:26:47,700
In order to unite the guardians power power the shrine maiden must communicate. Sorry. I miss I lost my voice

2077
04:26:47,780 --> 04:26:50,500
I lost my my my yohan voice

2078
04:26:52,500 --> 04:26:54,500
And

2079
04:26:54,580 --> 04:26:57,220
In order uh, what was the word?

2080
04:26:57,700 --> 04:27:03,140
In order to unite the guardians power the shrine maiden must communicate with the guardian at the temple

2081
04:27:03,700 --> 04:27:07,540
Rudy and jack I ask you as the minister of aldehyde

2082
04:27:10,740 --> 04:27:15,940
Go see the princess at the shrine in town and take her to the guardian temple. You're counting on you

2083
04:27:16,820 --> 04:27:18,820
oki

2084
04:27:20,500 --> 04:27:25,860
This majesty under protection and now that the princess is leaving I as a soldier

2085
04:27:26,260 --> 04:27:28,260
Not know who to look up to anymore

2086
04:27:31,940 --> 04:27:36,100
Managy was ushering the ones who failed to make us make it to the exit

2087
04:27:37,060 --> 04:27:39,380
Soon enough we were surrounded by fire and monster

2088
04:27:40,100 --> 04:27:44,260
George and I somehow fought our way back to the castle, but his majesty had taken a hit

2089
04:27:44,980 --> 04:27:47,940
Broke my heart to realize that I had failed to protect his majesty

2090
04:27:48,260 --> 04:27:55,940
He deeply regret my failure to protect his majesty, especially since I was so close by when he was hit

2091
04:27:57,460 --> 04:27:59,460
I was supposed to be his majesty shield

2092
04:28:03,780 --> 04:28:09,300
Once I'm calm I can figure out how to escort his majesty to the castle safely now

2093
04:28:10,660 --> 04:28:14,340
Why couldn't I have figured it out back at the exhibition?

2094
04:28:18,420 --> 04:28:21,620
It's kind of sad right?

2095
04:28:26,820 --> 04:28:28,820
They're all going through it

2096
04:28:30,660 --> 04:28:33,380
And still recently peaceful even after the attack

2097
04:28:34,100 --> 04:28:39,220
I'm proud to be in a country where no one would take advantage of this confusing state of affairs

2098
04:28:41,620 --> 04:28:43,620
Don't jinx it geez

2099
04:28:43,860 --> 04:28:51,220
While the lodges in town are closed the west guard house is open to travelers who wish to rest

2100
04:28:51,700 --> 04:28:55,460
Good idea to return the castle and rest once your HP is low

2101
04:28:56,180 --> 04:28:57,940
because

2102
04:28:57,940 --> 04:29:04,020
Of the economic downfall there will they will charge you 1.0 times more than the usual price

2103
04:29:04,820 --> 04:29:17,780
Like why are they so miserable while their king just died and like all like half of the citizens also died

2104
04:29:17,780 --> 04:29:37,380
There's another benefit to having a lucky card and a gala card beside using them in battle the gala card can be sold at a pretty high price

2105
04:29:38,180 --> 04:29:43,300
You even make more gala by selling it to the tool shop than using it in battle

2106
04:29:43,620 --> 04:29:48,180
So you look at this place

2107
04:29:50,260 --> 04:29:52,260
Ruin

2108
04:29:53,780 --> 04:30:01,700
Medical medicinal smell comes from seeping out from under the door it reeks of death going further seems like a bad idea

2109
04:30:07,460 --> 04:30:11,780
Hey you the wanderer let me give you advice on how to you can be more of a man

2110
04:30:13,620 --> 04:30:18,020
Do one good deed per day start by dropping some money into this donation box

2111
04:30:18,980 --> 04:30:23,860
Doesn't it feel good to know that because of your generosity our town will be rebuilt again

2112
04:30:27,780 --> 04:30:30,740
I look at this horrible sight unfair and cruel

2113
04:30:32,100 --> 04:30:37,380
Ever all all is not lost believe you can make out a hide a beautiful place once more

2114
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:46,500
Mayor I began to collect donations to restore to the town our goal is to collect 600,000 gala

2115
04:31:02,020 --> 04:31:06,660
Won't be easy but we can do it every mountain is scaled the same way one step at a time

2116
04:31:08,020 --> 04:31:13,700
I appreciate if you could also help us with any amount they never even give me a choice

2117
04:31:19,140 --> 04:31:21,140
That's a lot of farming

2118
04:31:38,340 --> 04:31:47,460
Oh, she's wearing a new outfit. Oh, it's cute. What the it's cute. Look she's got like cute little earrings on

2119
04:31:52,900 --> 04:31:58,740
They fixed my hair a bit do you like it? Oh, she looks cute

2120
04:32:01,460 --> 04:32:03,620
Jack's initial reaction. What the?

2121
04:32:08,180 --> 04:32:14,420
Oh, she does a little spin. Yes, it's changing to more comfortable clothes. Do they look okay?

2122
04:32:16,820 --> 04:32:18,820
Oh, yes, I think it suits you fine

2123
04:32:24,740 --> 04:32:26,740
Bye

2124
04:32:28,340 --> 04:32:30,340
You like one woman is that what you're saying?

2125
04:32:37,380 --> 04:32:39,380
I

2126
04:32:44,740 --> 04:32:47,300
I thought you had a preference for purple, right?

2127
04:32:47,300 --> 04:32:49,300
Okay

2128
04:33:06,820 --> 04:33:11,540
Good good good. I'm about to feel jealous there for a second

2129
04:33:17,460 --> 04:33:25,860
I'm fine now crying will not change anything nor start anything anew

2130
04:33:29,220 --> 04:33:32,100
A rainbow always follows the storm it's true

2131
04:33:35,220 --> 04:33:38,660
My mother used to console me when I cried used to tell me

2132
04:33:39,700 --> 04:33:41,700
Nothing is impossible

2133
04:33:42,340 --> 04:33:48,020
Then she would say a prayer for me. She taught me to believe in myself to believe in tomorrow

2134
04:33:51,380 --> 04:33:58,340
I'm going to be strong even stronger than strong mean powerful, but I will need your help

2135
04:34:07,620 --> 04:34:10,820
Princess we're here to ask you to be part of our team

2136
04:34:11,700 --> 04:34:13,700
Spirit needs to take flight

2137
04:34:14,340 --> 04:34:16,340
So I'm part of the team?

2138
04:34:16,740 --> 04:34:20,020
Yes, of course, but we don't have much time left. We need to go now

2139
04:34:21,060 --> 04:34:23,060
Yes

2140
04:34:26,500 --> 04:34:28,500
Your mother your father

2141
04:34:30,660 --> 04:34:33,700
When I come back here, I promise to be much stronger

2142
04:34:34,980 --> 04:34:38,120
Please say a prayer for our safe journey and safe return

2143
04:34:42,100 --> 04:34:44,100
I

2144
04:34:44,500 --> 04:34:50,980
Have believed the haircut like really really just changed his mind right just immediately he was like

2145
04:34:52,020 --> 04:34:54,020
He was like short hair woman

2146
04:34:56,260 --> 04:35:00,180
To reach the guardian temple you must cross the mountain path

2147
04:35:01,300 --> 04:35:03,300
located east of aldehyde

2148
04:35:04,340 --> 04:35:06,180
the field viewer

2149
04:35:06,180 --> 04:35:12,500
We received from father. No wait the field viewer. We received from father. Johan can help us get there

2150
04:35:15,540 --> 04:35:18,420
Humans must be planning to attack more humans. We must hurry

2151
04:35:24,260 --> 04:35:26,980
We'll get 600k back probably

2152
04:35:28,580 --> 04:35:30,580
unlikely

2153
04:35:31,540 --> 04:35:34,260
Welcome, let me upgrade your arm dr. Have I

2154
04:35:35,540 --> 04:35:38,900
How can you do it when you're you're building completely kaput?

2155
04:35:40,180 --> 04:35:42,180
9000 shit

2156
04:35:43,380 --> 04:35:45,380
aim bonus

2157
04:35:45,700 --> 04:35:47,700
bullets

2158
04:35:50,180 --> 04:35:56,500
I'm thinking bullets. I'm thinking bullets so I can have five bullets. What do you think?

2159
04:36:00,580 --> 04:36:02,580
You

2160
04:36:06,660 --> 04:36:08,660
Or maybe more crit

2161
04:36:17,300 --> 04:36:21,940
The tune reflects this counter and auto an equip auto reload

2162
04:36:22,580 --> 04:36:24,580
amplify power when a critical hit

2163
04:36:25,220 --> 04:36:26,180
hits

2164
04:36:26,260 --> 04:36:28,260
Increase maximum ammo

2165
04:36:28,980 --> 04:36:30,980
increase shot accuracy

2166
04:36:32,420 --> 04:36:36,100
Might need the shot accuracy because Rudy's been missing

2167
04:36:41,700 --> 04:36:43,700
He's been missing

2168
04:36:47,700 --> 04:36:49,700
Hmm

2169
04:36:49,700 --> 04:36:51,700
Okay, let's do this one

2170
04:36:52,420 --> 04:36:56,260
I'm probably easiness. Yeah, and now I'm poor

2171
04:36:59,620 --> 04:37:03,700
Been too scared to fall asleep at night ever since the demons made that horrible attack on us

2172
04:37:04,740 --> 04:37:08,500
Being left standing is burnt. I don't even know how we can recover from this

2173
04:37:10,180 --> 04:37:12,180
Probably can't

2174
04:37:12,180 --> 04:37:14,180
Oh there you ask me to save your progress

2175
04:37:21,860 --> 04:37:23,860
I

2176
04:37:25,460 --> 04:37:29,860
Used to be a comfortable lodge, but after the attack this place will not see a single guest for some time

2177
04:37:34,900 --> 04:37:39,060
Your owner dog used to live here. Hopefully they survived the attack

2178
04:37:44,580 --> 04:37:46,580
Uh

2179
04:37:47,380 --> 04:37:53,700
Please belong to a scientist Emma monsters have done a lot of damage

2180
04:37:54,500 --> 04:37:59,300
Listening closely the sound of a pounding hammer can be heard. This is sign of the scientist survived

2181
04:38:07,380 --> 04:38:10,660
Finally handwritten notices posted on the rattling door

2182
04:38:11,460 --> 04:38:13,460
Notice the store relocation

2183
04:38:13,620 --> 04:38:17,860
Because of the recent malicious attacks. We only operate at the exhibition

2184
04:38:18,820 --> 04:38:23,460
You're very sorry for the inconvenience, but I hope to see you at the exhibition site. Jeremy and the owner

2185
04:38:26,340 --> 04:38:28,340
Okay, what should I get next?

2186
04:38:32,100 --> 04:38:34,100
No, I no wait, I never got a

2187
04:38:36,020 --> 04:38:38,020
Best graph never mind

2188
04:38:40,900 --> 04:38:42,900
I think lightning was really good though

2189
04:38:48,500 --> 04:38:54,740
The mayor and his family lived here there's a creaking noise from the torn walls or require some time to restore

2190
04:38:57,940 --> 04:39:01,940
This building used to be stylish, but now it's ruined a shadow of its former self

2191
04:39:11,540 --> 04:39:13,540
Oh

2192
04:39:14,260 --> 04:39:16,260
Now I can get the chest

2193
04:39:19,140 --> 04:39:25,700
Oh, they're welcome to the new my new blue sky mart with my rage my business here after my original store was destroyed

2194
04:39:26,660 --> 04:39:29,940
Not about leaving town, but so many customers here in aldehy

2195
04:39:31,540 --> 04:39:35,620
Planning on increasing my selection while restoration gets underway check back often

2196
04:39:37,700 --> 04:39:39,700
Just one medicine

2197
04:39:41,380 --> 04:39:43,380
Oh

2198
04:39:43,540 --> 04:39:45,540
We got the chest

2199
04:39:48,500 --> 04:39:51,860
Hold on the bomb there

2200
04:39:54,580 --> 04:39:56,580
Yes

2201
04:40:04,980 --> 04:40:06,980
I'm so glad I checked over here

2202
04:40:07,940 --> 04:40:11,940
Oh look free medicine. Haha. Sorry

2203
04:40:20,420 --> 04:40:23,780
Now I can do more magic. What should we get next wind?

2204
04:40:27,540 --> 04:40:33,220
I'm gardening the exhibition site to make sure nobody enters unsafe to walk around here with all the shattered artifacts

2205
04:40:37,700 --> 04:40:42,820
All used to be here. I remember seeing the doll

2206
04:40:45,140 --> 04:40:47,140
Figuring is creepy

2207
04:40:49,220 --> 04:40:52,020
First don't want to touch that I do

2208
04:41:01,140 --> 04:41:03,140
Yes, the one that fell

2209
04:41:07,060 --> 04:41:09,060
I want it though

2210
04:41:10,020 --> 04:41:12,020
I bomb it

2211
04:41:15,220 --> 04:41:19,300
Tinder is hot so hot is tinder keep using it. Wait, what?

2212
04:41:20,180 --> 04:41:22,180
Oh

2213
04:41:34,420 --> 04:41:37,220
Hold on I'm gonna angle myself better

2214
04:41:40,500 --> 04:41:42,500
I'm pretty sure I burnt you a little bit

2215
04:41:50,260 --> 04:41:52,260
I

2216
04:41:59,220 --> 04:42:03,700
Bombs are blistering hot I botanist as a nation amplifies effects

2217
04:42:06,500 --> 04:42:09,140
Rat rat win rat nation word for to needle

2218
04:42:11,300 --> 04:42:13,300
I just said shit

2219
04:42:16,900 --> 04:42:18,900
All right

2220
04:42:20,260 --> 04:42:22,420
This explains your tools. Okay

2221
04:42:43,140 --> 04:42:46,900
Oh now we have the crest one what should we do?

2222
04:42:50,180 --> 04:42:52,180
What should we do now?

2223
04:43:01,140 --> 04:43:03,140
Light damage

2224
04:43:07,780 --> 04:43:09,780
Wind did we do weaned?

2225
04:43:20,100 --> 04:43:24,180
Light damage might be good for like undead enemies. Yeah

2226
04:43:34,820 --> 04:43:39,540
Just need to collect them all let's do light for now

2227
04:43:46,900 --> 04:43:48,900
Yeah

2228
04:43:50,180 --> 04:43:52,180
I

2229
04:43:54,020 --> 04:43:57,940
Said west or east I can't remember what the direction was oops

2230
04:43:59,940 --> 04:44:06,740
The field viewer is a device that projects the location of mo of visited towns and facilities on the local map

2231
04:44:07,220 --> 04:44:10,820
So flashes the location of yet undiscovered towns and places

2232
04:44:11,540 --> 04:44:13,540
Views press the select button

2233
04:44:13,700 --> 04:44:20,740
While the field viewer is on pressing the select button switches the displayed map to local world and enlarge switch maps as needed

2234
04:44:23,380 --> 04:44:25,380
Oh, thank fucking god

2235
04:44:44,500 --> 04:44:51,300
This is gonna be worse than usual can we go here before?

2236

Really it's okay for you to cry nobody blames you or thanks isn't proper for princess to show her tears

2239
04:45:29,380 --> 04:45:31,380
You feel like crying let it out

2244
04:45:59,140 --> 04:46:02,660
You who are a shaman of the guardian you can gain more power by connecting with them

Great about adahide from the teachers must have been a terrible disaster

2248
04:46:29,700 --> 04:46:33,140
But I believe that you will be able to overcome any difficulties you may face

2249
04:46:39,700 --> 04:46:42,020
There it is there she is hold on

2250
04:46:44,260 --> 04:46:49,060
Cecilia I feel like anything I might offer in sympathy would be insufficient

2251
04:46:49,780 --> 04:46:52,980
I think there are many people in this abbey who are similarly concerned about you

2252
04:46:54,980 --> 04:46:58,980
And you've had any hardship tell us you'll line our shoulders any time

Grow dressed in all black with silver hair excuse me. That's indigo

2258
04:47:40,340 --> 04:47:43,860
Floated in the air and smiled coquettishly as she

2259
04:47:45,300 --> 04:47:49,700
Wait coquette flash coquette flash co coquette

2260
04:47:51,380 --> 04:47:53,380
Fuck it

2261
04:47:53,860 --> 04:47:59,220
She had a slim body and red lips that contrasted harshly with her white skin

2262
04:48:01,060 --> 04:48:07,140
Although she had a beautiful face her most impressive feature for her strong shining purple eyes

2263
04:48:08,420 --> 04:48:10,420
I am the breaker of rules

2264
04:48:12,740 --> 04:48:19,140
Can I root a guest from another world kane canary please lend your power to me

2265
04:48:20,180 --> 04:48:22,180
Her clear voice echoed in the chapel

2266
04:48:24,340 --> 04:48:32,900
You should you show up suddenly and ask me to help but how do I know uh I can trust you I replied stepping back cautiously

2267
04:48:35,540 --> 04:48:37,540
Hold on

2268
04:48:39,860 --> 04:48:45,620
Hold on sorry I'm gonna have to lean back for this because I can't read at this angle

2269
04:48:50,260 --> 04:48:52,260
You are right kane canary

2270
04:48:53,380 --> 04:48:55,940
You just come to this period the girl in black

2271
04:48:57,220 --> 04:48:59,220
Slips twisted into a smile

2272
04:49:02,500 --> 04:49:09,860
You will be forced to choose soon that woman must have told you that if you don't get to the capital by pass over 10 days from now

2273
04:49:11,620 --> 04:49:14,260
Stop right there rule breaker now is me

2274
04:49:15,220 --> 04:49:18,260
Neither the time nor place lori stood in front of me

2275
04:49:18,900 --> 04:49:24,660
I'm not going to let you influence kane small lights appeared at her fingertips

2276
04:49:34,420 --> 04:49:37,460
And you're going to compete against a wizard of mirror space

2277
04:49:38,260 --> 04:49:40,260
It's silly of you to do so

2278
04:49:41,300 --> 04:49:46,740
The girl licked her lips with her tongue whetted her lips looked dark red like blood

2279
04:49:48,580 --> 04:49:53,220
I will compete complete my mission to have kane sent back to his time

2280
04:49:53,940 --> 04:49:55,940
lori

2281
04:49:56,580 --> 04:49:58,580
I'm mixing up the characters. I'm sorry

2282
04:49:59,700 --> 04:50:05,860
I will compete complete my mission to have kane sent back to his time lori said

2283
04:50:06,500 --> 04:50:10,580
Defiantly you're a pitiful little girl the girl in black continued

2284
04:50:11,380 --> 04:50:13,380
derisively

2285
04:50:13,700 --> 04:50:15,700
Ah

2286
04:50:17,220 --> 04:50:18,500
Lori didn't

2287
04:50:18,500 --> 04:50:24,980
Answer with words she closed her eyes and moved her lips her white fingers through colds in the air

2288
04:50:26,020 --> 04:50:32,260
Though I couldn't make out her low muttering there was a rhythm to the words. I could feel the atmosphere changing

2289
04:50:34,100 --> 04:50:37,700
Though I couldn't make out her low muttering there was a rhythm white

2290
04:50:37,700 --> 04:50:43,060
I already read that and I could feel the atmosphere changing the girl in black hung in the air

2291
04:50:43,380 --> 04:50:45,620
Watching lori's movement with interest

2292
04:50:47,060 --> 04:50:52,740
Suddenly lori opened her eyes. She parked a couple short words at the same time swung her hand down

2293
04:50:53,540 --> 04:50:59,620
I gasped the sunshine through the stained glass focused into a single beam

2294
04:51:00,660 --> 04:51:08,840
The spear of incandescent light danced by lori's clutched fist clutched fist. Wow. I'm so sorry. I'm so bad at reading today

2295
04:51:14,100 --> 04:51:16,100
Oh

2296
04:51:18,980 --> 04:51:26,020
Flash burn at lori's word the light released with a bright flash everything went white

2297
04:51:31,220 --> 04:51:35,380
Is that all you've got little girl her voice full of laughter fell on us

2298
04:51:36,660 --> 04:51:40,340
The girl was surrounded by barrier and stood before us unharmed

2299
04:51:41,220 --> 04:51:46,740
My oh she is esl my first language is english. Thank you very much

2300
04:52:02,980 --> 04:52:09,060
I can bend space I pass your spell to the place known as the river of unconsciousness

2301
04:52:09,620 --> 04:52:11,620
Wow, this is so deep

2302
04:52:14,260 --> 04:52:16,260
Is that better or worse shut up?

2303
04:52:25,380 --> 04:52:30,340
The girl in black smiled patronizingly at lori who was becoming angry

2304
04:52:31,540 --> 04:52:33,380
Now it's my turn

2305
04:52:33,460 --> 04:52:41,780
She thrust her palms towards lori and her hem fluttered in the charged air behold the power of a rule breaker

2306
04:52:43,220 --> 04:52:46,500
Parable sound echoed a flood of vivid light

2307
04:52:47,540 --> 04:52:49,540
poured down on lori's head

2308
04:52:50,500 --> 04:52:54,580
There was an explosion by the window and all the stained glass shattered

2309
04:52:55,300 --> 04:53:00,420
Instantly lori created a shell of light to shield herself from the falling glass

2310
04:53:01,380 --> 04:53:06,020
I gazed in disbelief at the fighting method and set my hand on my sword

2311
04:53:07,460 --> 04:53:11,940
Aniruda reached her hand out to me pain come with me

2312
04:53:12,900 --> 04:53:19,380
You and I can create powers that will break the rule of this world that can break the god's power

2313
04:53:21,220 --> 04:53:24,980
I glared back at her wordlessly her violet eyes pierced me

2314
04:53:26,260 --> 04:53:28,260
Don't listen to her cane. It's a lie

2315
04:53:30,500 --> 04:53:35,380
Kanai ruta smiled slightly at lori who spoke grimacing with pain

2316
04:53:36,900 --> 04:53:39,140
One who breaks the rules does not lie

2317
04:53:40,260 --> 04:53:42,260
Pain will choose what to do

2318
04:53:42,660 --> 04:53:44,660
Two sets of eyes fell on me

2319
04:53:44,820 --> 04:53:46,820
Kanai ruta's clinging glare

2320
04:53:47,300 --> 04:53:49,300
and lori's praying eyes

2321
04:53:50,340 --> 04:53:52,660
I gave it a moment and turned to kair

2322
04:53:53,860 --> 04:53:55,620
Kanai ruta

2323
04:53:55,620 --> 04:53:57,620
Thanks for the invitation, but no

2324
04:53:58,500 --> 04:54:00,500
Did not come here looking for power

2325
04:54:00,900 --> 04:54:02,900
power

2326
04:54:07,780 --> 04:54:11,460
I gave it a moment and turned to kanai ruta. Wait. No, I already read that

2327
04:54:12,260 --> 04:54:14,420
Did not come for powder at public

2328
04:54:16,020 --> 04:54:18,020
Power not powder. Wow

2329
04:54:19,300 --> 04:54:21,540
Gamer stuff's on mine. Uh-huh wink

2330
04:54:27,620 --> 04:54:33,380
If there is anything I dare to want is to know what transcends humanity the state of what the world

2331
04:54:34,020 --> 04:54:36,020
Of the world where god exists

2332
04:54:36,180 --> 04:54:40,180
Kanai ruta smirked at my answer the power your hope will come true

2333
04:54:41,220 --> 04:54:45,300
That might be true. I'm sick of destruction authority. I replied

2334
04:54:46,100 --> 04:54:47,460
Kanai ruta

2335
04:54:47,460 --> 04:54:49,460
Repeatedly tried to say something

2336
04:54:49,460 --> 04:54:51,460
I'm irritated

2337
04:54:51,460 --> 04:54:55,300
Then I heard footsteps from the corridor. Kanai ruta turned around and smiled

2338
04:54:56,260 --> 04:54:58,260
It's time for me to leave

2339
04:54:58,420 --> 04:55:00,420
Please remember pain

2340
04:55:00,420 --> 04:55:02,420
I'm the only one that understands you

2341
04:55:03,060 --> 04:55:06,660
In this world our reasons are the same mine and yours

2342
04:55:08,180 --> 04:55:10,180
See you again soon

2343
04:55:10,180 --> 04:55:13,780
She bent over and whispered in my ear the scent of orchid

2344
04:55:14,500 --> 04:55:16,500
on her porcelain skin

2345
04:55:16,660 --> 04:55:18,900
When I looked up she had already disappeared

2346
04:55:20,100 --> 04:55:24,500
The sound the door opened women wearing similar uniforms ran into the room

2347
04:55:25,140 --> 04:55:26,260
Sorry

2348
04:55:26,260 --> 04:55:29,700
A girl in a cave the symbol of god on it called her over

2349
04:55:30,660 --> 04:55:34,260
Lori bowed her head down and stepped forward with a determined look

2350
04:55:35,140 --> 04:55:37,140
She fell to the floor covering her cheek

2351
04:55:38,580 --> 04:55:45,060
Why did you let that woman escape as you are now you will never obtain the strength the holy knight hopes

2352
04:55:47,140 --> 04:55:49,940
The gloomy voice echoed in the chamber

2353
04:55:50,580 --> 04:55:52,580
It's exactly as the director said

2354
04:55:53,300 --> 04:55:55,300
Eibler voice chimes in

2355
04:55:55,700 --> 04:55:58,660
Indeed, you are not strong. You cannot accomplish your mission

2356
04:55:59,300 --> 04:56:01,300
My jaw dropped at their words

2357
04:56:02,500 --> 04:56:07,460
You don't know what you're saying. It's not like you are here in time to prevent the woman's attack either

2358
04:56:08,420 --> 04:56:11,060
An uninvited guest should keep their mouth shut

2359
04:56:11,860 --> 04:56:14,740
The sister struck her chin out stuck her teeth

2360
04:56:15,540 --> 04:56:17,540
Stuck her chin out

2361
04:56:18,100 --> 04:56:20,100
Stuck

2362
04:56:20,180 --> 04:56:23,860
I am so not I am so bad right now

2363
04:56:31,700 --> 04:56:37,780
Fuck her chin out as she said this staring down her nose at me her eyes filled with great hostility

2364
04:56:38,900 --> 04:56:42,420
I decide if I should keep quiet or not the same as I choose

2365
04:56:43,380 --> 04:56:46,980
Between as I chose between the rule breaker and lori

2366
04:56:47,780 --> 04:56:50,580
At my words the sister grew indignant

2367
04:56:51,460 --> 04:56:54,180
Are you going to let lori go with someone like that?

2368
04:56:54,900 --> 04:56:58,420
Sister who stuck her chin out turned away from the director

2369
04:56:59,460 --> 04:57:01,460
I ignored the farce taking place

2370
04:57:02,260 --> 04:57:07,060
Got close to lori who was trying to stand and reached my hand out to her

2371
04:57:07,380 --> 04:57:12,660
Thank you. She muttered with a small voice that the sisters could not hear

2372
04:57:14,420 --> 04:57:18,660
My visit was known rather wisely by many people. I said softly

2373
04:57:19,540 --> 04:57:21,540
While the sisters quarreled

2374
04:57:22,180 --> 04:57:24,900
Yes, we knew we would have a visitor

2375
04:57:25,780 --> 04:57:27,780
But she knew to wait for me here. Why?

2376
04:57:28,660 --> 04:57:32,100
My blood belongs to the one who rules life and time

2377
04:57:32,980 --> 04:57:35,700
Since the day I was born I was tied to you

2378
04:57:36,500 --> 04:57:38,500
That's how I knew to wait for you here

2379
04:57:39,860 --> 04:57:42,580
I exist to wait on you. That's how

2380
04:57:43,380 --> 04:57:45,380
I pursed my lips

2381
04:57:45,540 --> 04:57:48,580
Though she might have been convinced I wasn't

2382
04:57:49,540 --> 04:57:51,540
lori understood my facial expression

2383
04:57:51,940 --> 04:57:55,220
But then she tried to say more I heard a voice ask

2384
04:57:55,940 --> 04:57:58,900
lori is he the guest whom you've been waiting for?

2385
04:58:00,340 --> 04:58:04,500
The black eyes looked inquisitive at lori and myself

2386
04:58:06,660 --> 04:58:11,700
She looked about 10 years old and wore the same uniform as lori on her face

2387
04:58:13,060 --> 04:58:15,140
I could feel my face was losing color

2388
04:58:17,140 --> 04:58:21,300
It's just like her girl. I accidentally killed three days ago

2389
04:58:23,380 --> 04:58:25,380
It was a different person

2390
04:58:25,700 --> 04:58:27,220
Stay calm

2391
04:58:27,220 --> 04:58:30,740
While I was trying to calm myself the girl all started speaking crisply

2392
04:58:31,620 --> 04:58:33,620
I'm ish

2393
04:58:36,100 --> 04:58:38,100
Ayashi

2394
04:58:41,620 --> 04:58:43,620
Yeah, I'll say Ayashi

2395
04:58:44,500 --> 04:58:46,740
Ayashi of the people pillar

2396
04:58:48,660 --> 04:58:51,620
I could not say anything as she walked towards me and smiled

2397
04:58:52,180 --> 04:58:54,180
I came here because I sense trouble

2398
04:58:54,660 --> 04:58:57,140
People from the future are not much different from us

2399
04:59:00,900 --> 04:59:05,620
Ayashi go back to your room Ayashi smiled going her white tee

2400
04:59:06,020 --> 04:59:08,020
as if unconcerned by lori's words

2401
04:59:09,540 --> 04:59:13,940
No, I have decided to travel to the city of jasper with lori and him

2402
04:59:15,140 --> 04:59:16,500
Jasper

2403
04:59:16,500 --> 04:59:19,940
I asked more the director's voice intruded

2404
04:59:21,060 --> 04:59:23,060
Finally they had reached a conclusion

2405
04:59:23,940 --> 04:59:28,980
I turned to the director and glared at her. I didn't care if she thought me provocative

2406
04:59:30,340 --> 04:59:32,900
You are a guest from a time of lost faith

2407
04:59:33,860 --> 04:59:39,540
It is inconsistent with our world for the god and magic rule

2408
04:59:40,420 --> 04:59:42,420
Her hateful stare meant mine

2409
04:59:43,380 --> 04:59:46,580
The gods draw strength from the power of our beliefs

2410
04:59:47,220 --> 04:59:50,420
Your godless thoughts are very dangerous for this world

2411
04:59:50,580 --> 04:59:52,580
Oh

2412
05:00:02,100 --> 05:00:09,060
Then why don't you just kill me I threw out the question carelessly though I had been taken aback by her words

2413
05:00:10,100 --> 05:00:15,540
Forbidden for us to have wanderers life end in some period other than their original period

2414
05:00:16,420 --> 05:00:18,420
Misfortune would visit this world

2415
05:00:19,540 --> 05:00:21,140
You see

2416
05:00:21,140 --> 05:00:23,860
The worlds of science and gods differ

2417
05:00:24,580 --> 05:00:28,580
But we also obey the law of the conservation of energy

2418
05:00:29,140 --> 05:00:30,980
director lectured

2419
05:00:30,980 --> 05:00:35,140
Like my world requires a negative to compensate a positive she nodded

2420
05:00:38,180 --> 05:00:44,900
Lori spoke of a mission to send me back in other words you want to tell me that I should leave Europe soon, right?

2421
05:00:45,780 --> 05:00:47,780
That's correct

2422
05:00:47,860 --> 05:00:50,740
The director and sisters nodded in unison

2423
05:00:52,340 --> 05:00:56,340
It's not impossible to understand. I am a lawless human in this world

2424
05:00:57,060 --> 05:01:01,540
A troublesome existence to them who would cause disaster if I died here

2425
05:01:02,820 --> 05:01:06,820
It would never be my intention to upset the lives of people in this period

2426
05:01:08,180 --> 05:01:11,940
But to just accept their mission as mine those sisters exist

2427
05:01:12,740 --> 05:01:16,420
Did to get on my nerves. I was so incredibly thirsty

2428
05:01:18,260 --> 05:01:25,540
In my world everything was horrible. I couldn't people stop watching gods a miracle a miracle

2429
05:01:27,060 --> 05:01:29,060
Wait, sorry

2430
05:01:34,580 --> 05:01:36,580
Well, that's that's the sentence

2431
05:01:37,540 --> 05:01:45,060
How could a god forgive the unjust that would take the life of an innocent girl a life taken by my hands

2432
05:01:47,220 --> 05:01:51,860
This world of magic might hold the answers to the questions I had about my world

2433
05:01:52,980 --> 05:01:54,980
But I know I can work with you

2434
05:01:55,780 --> 05:01:57,780
Direct the director looked at me

2435
05:01:58,420 --> 05:02:00,420
Our guests. I know your wishes

2436
05:02:01,300 --> 05:02:06,020
I promise to allow to meet the holy king the highest peace in this world

2437
05:02:07,380 --> 05:02:09,380
The holy king

2438
05:02:09,380 --> 05:02:11,220
director nodded

2439
05:02:11,220 --> 05:02:16,260
He rules magic in this world and knows the relationship between gods and humans

2440
05:02:17,300 --> 05:02:20,820
If anyone could he would be able to answer your questions

2441
05:02:22,260 --> 05:02:23,780
I bit

2442
05:02:23,780 --> 05:02:25,780
my back teeth hard

2443
05:02:26,420 --> 05:02:30,820
The deal she offered me was the same as the ones I was going to offer her

2444
05:02:31,540 --> 05:02:33,540
I don't like she I don't

2445
05:02:34,100 --> 05:02:36,100
I don't like that she offered it first

2446
05:02:36,820 --> 05:02:38,820
I

2447
05:02:40,660 --> 05:02:42,660
Know it's not a trap

2448
05:02:44,980 --> 05:02:51,140
I am to take you to the capital or I am to take you to the capital or he said so please

2449
05:02:52,100 --> 05:02:57,620
I she stepped forward to face the director director. I want to go with them

2450
05:02:59,380 --> 05:03:03,140
I want to go with them too. I'd like to see my father and Jasper

2451
05:03:04,100 --> 05:03:06,100
I understand your feelings. I ask you

2452
05:03:06,900 --> 05:03:12,580
But you're still training aren't you as she's facial expression changed. She gave a forced smile

2453
05:03:14,180 --> 05:03:16,180
I was promised

2454
05:03:16,180 --> 05:03:18,180
There was no meeting or sworn letter

2455
05:03:19,300 --> 05:03:22,980
I was also prohibited from learning the thumb and magic of the pillar people

2456
05:03:24,260 --> 05:03:27,300
As she I asked she exclaimed her cheeks blushing

2457
05:03:28,020 --> 05:03:34,180
I turned my eyes to Ayashi the director looked at the sister next to her and opened her mouth with a sigh

2458
05:03:35,780 --> 05:03:37,780
I understand

2459
05:03:37,780 --> 05:03:39,780
I commit you to go to the city of japan

2460
05:03:40,580 --> 05:03:42,580
Thank you very much

2461
05:03:42,580 --> 05:03:44,580
Ayashi flashed her instant smile

2462
05:03:45,780 --> 05:03:47,780
The director turned to me again

2463
05:03:48,980 --> 05:03:50,980
These two will accompany

2464
05:03:51,220 --> 05:03:54,580
Then we will see if you are worried by any

2465
05:03:54,820 --> 05:03:56,820
Deceit on airport

2466
05:03:57,940 --> 05:03:59,940
Had her words and made her a difficult face

2467
05:04:01,860 --> 05:04:03,860
Even though I had already agreed

2468
05:04:05,140 --> 05:04:07,140
Okay

2469
05:04:07,140 --> 05:04:09,140
You're going to the city of Jasper

2470
05:04:09,780 --> 05:04:11,780
For both sides benefits

2471
05:04:12,740 --> 05:04:14,740
Good

2472
05:04:14,740 --> 05:04:18,260
The vow was made here. The director pronounced solemnly

2473
05:04:19,300 --> 05:04:21,300
Sorry, you're so stubborn

2474
05:04:22,180 --> 05:04:24,180
Laurie you're so stubborn

2475
05:04:24,500 --> 05:04:26,500
The director scolded

2476
05:04:26,580 --> 05:04:27,700
I know

2477
05:04:27,700 --> 05:04:29,700
Laurie nodded contently

2478
05:04:30,020 --> 05:04:32,020
Be careful with the mirror

2479
05:04:32,420 --> 05:04:34,420
Director turned away

2480
05:04:34,500 --> 05:04:36,500
I let out a sigh of relief

2481
05:04:36,900 --> 05:04:38,900
Thank you for offering to guide me

2482
05:04:39,300 --> 05:04:41,300
There was no reply

2483
05:04:41,300 --> 05:04:43,300
Laurie

2484
05:04:43,300 --> 05:04:47,140
Inquired the face looked as if she had swallowed a lemon

2485
05:04:47,140 --> 05:04:52,500
Why did that director allow Ayashi to come with us?

2486
05:04:53,940 --> 05:04:55,940
Laurie muttered and bit her lip

2487
05:04:56,100 --> 05:04:58,100
Her red lips were slightly white

2488
05:04:59,140 --> 05:05:00,180
I looked away

2489
05:05:00,180 --> 05:05:04,980
The stained glass window projected its picture of the gods on the stone floor

2490
05:05:05,780 --> 05:05:07,620
The image trembled

2491
05:05:07,620 --> 05:05:11,700
I had a vague feeling that I had just accepted an unbearable task

2492
05:05:13,940 --> 05:05:14,820
Oh, what?

2493
05:05:14,820 --> 05:05:17,060
Okay, we'll stop here. These books are really good

2494
05:05:30,500 --> 05:05:34,500
It's already over. It's all over

2495
05:05:34,820 --> 05:05:44,420
It was very, uh, choony

2496
05:05:46,180 --> 05:05:48,900
That story was very choony. Oh, that's funny

2497
05:05:52,980 --> 05:05:54,980
But I'm so sleepy

2498
05:05:57,060 --> 05:05:59,060
I need a save somewhere

2499
05:06:04,500 --> 05:06:06,500
I

2500
05:06:10,740 --> 05:06:12,740
Back to town. Yeah

2501
05:06:25,940 --> 05:06:27,300
Oh

2502
05:06:27,300 --> 05:06:29,300
I just noticed the uh

2503
05:06:29,860 --> 05:06:33,220
The the sprite for Cecilia changed too

2504
05:06:35,300 --> 05:06:40,820
That is a sprite artwork change too

2505
05:06:55,540 --> 05:06:57,540
He looks cuter

2506
05:07:05,380 --> 05:07:07,380
Tch

2507
05:07:15,620 --> 05:07:19,540
He looks so serious when she was like I'm the princess

2508
05:07:34,500 --> 05:07:36,500
I

2509
05:07:45,300 --> 05:07:47,300
Like kind of scream like

2510
05:07:48,660 --> 05:07:50,660
Like a distant

2511
05:07:51,220 --> 05:07:53,220
Oh

2512
05:08:00,180 --> 05:08:07,140
Okay, I'm too eepy some pie. I woke up way too early. I didn't even take a nap

2513
05:08:10,580 --> 05:08:14,900
So I'm gonna probably head off now

2514
05:08:20,660 --> 05:08:22,660

2515
05:08:33,460 --> 05:08:37,860
Okay time to turn off turn off. Oops

2516
05:08:44,580 --> 05:08:46,580

2517
05:08:47,460 --> 05:08:49,140

2518
05:08:49,140 --> 05:08:51,140

2520
05:09:10,820 --> 05:09:12,820

Monday tomorrow we're back to mario rpg

2530
05:10:14,580 --> 05:10:17,700
Why because I do not want to forget how to play these games

2531
05:10:20,100 --> 05:10:24,580
And following mario rpg we're back to wild arms again

2532
05:10:26,820 --> 05:10:28,820
And then I get my day off

2533
05:10:29,860 --> 05:10:31,300
And then

2534
05:10:31,380 --> 05:10:36,260
On thursday we are returning back to killer seven

2535
05:10:46,980 --> 05:10:50,660
Now I need to remember how to play killer seven that might be an issue

2536
05:10:53,460 --> 05:11:00,260
And then we're going to do on friday an asmr stream

Ha ha ha

2573
05:14:53,700 --> 05:15:00,980
It was in the heat of the moment I I let I let my my imagination get ahead of my of itself and then I was like

2574
05:15:02,340 --> 05:15:07,460
Thinking about all sorts of ways to just remove life from you

2575
05:15:12,820 --> 05:15:16,100
If that happened

2576
05:15:26,100 --> 05:15:29,060
So don't do anything like that, okay why I'm gone

Sempais must keep other senpais in check as well

Well, what should I call this?

2584
05:16:12,820 --> 05:16:15,700

Honor system trust buddy

05:16:37,140 --> 05:16:39,140
Uh counterability partner

2591
05:16:39,940 --> 05:16:42,740
Have you thought of making a free chat?

2592
05:16:46,100 --> 05:16:48,100
I did

2593
05:16:49,620 --> 05:16:59,780
But my only issue is that um, I can't monitor it all the time and I can't put the onus on mods either to

2594
05:17:00,580 --> 05:17:02,580
to to um

2595
05:17:06,900 --> 05:17:08,900
To monitor it as well

2596
05:17:09,140 --> 05:17:11,140
So

2597
05:17:17,940 --> 05:17:20,260
That's my only that's my only issue, right?

2598
05:17:32,340 --> 05:17:34,340
That's my only issue is that

2599
05:17:34,660 --> 05:17:36,660
I would make a free chat

2600
05:17:36,900 --> 05:17:40,420
And I guess my peers are okay with it too, but

2601
05:17:43,300 --> 05:17:45,540
I'm barely I'm very controlling

2602
05:17:48,740 --> 05:17:52,900
I'm uh very controlling and I also

2603
05:17:56,100 --> 05:18:00,100
I also like touching grass a lot

2604
05:18:00,100 --> 05:18:02,100
I

2605
05:18:03,780 --> 05:18:09,060
Like touching grass a lot so unfortunately

2606
05:18:10,340 --> 05:18:15,540
Uh my use of social media is very limited

2607
05:18:19,300 --> 05:18:26,820
But yeah, I'm super controlling okay, I'm super controlling if shit hits the fan, I won't like it

2608
05:18:30,500 --> 05:18:36,180
Speaking of social media is there a reason why there's no alternative twitter?

2609
05:18:38,100 --> 05:18:42,820
Not a secret it's not a secret you can find it

2610
05:18:46,740 --> 05:18:48,740
It's really not a secret

2611
05:18:48,740 --> 05:18:50,740
I

2612
05:18:58,820 --> 05:19:03,380
I'll give you a little hint perhaps it's my last name instead

2613
05:19:03,380 --> 05:19:05,380
I

2614
05:19:14,340 --> 05:19:22,020
Also give you a hint it's most likely being followed by like everyone else's alt

2615
05:19:24,340 --> 05:19:26,340
So

2616
05:19:26,500 --> 05:19:33,460
So it's kind of easy to find if you have one you can find everyone else's

2617
05:19:39,620 --> 05:19:44,260
I'm pretty sure you can find that one first and then find everyone else's

2618
05:19:46,900 --> 05:19:48,900
Found the alt before the main

2619
05:19:49,540 --> 05:19:51,540
uh

2620
05:19:51,860 --> 05:19:54,900
Unfortunate it's unfortunate isn't it?

2621
05:19:56,660 --> 05:19:59,540
I'm sure a bunch of people they're like

2622
05:20:01,940 --> 05:20:05,940
There to just be like little hawks it makes me a little nervous

2623
05:20:08,980 --> 05:20:10,980
Makes me a little nervous, uh

2624
05:20:14,340 --> 05:20:17,460
That the alt is more popular than the main

2625
05:20:18,020 --> 05:20:20,020
So

2626
05:20:23,860 --> 05:20:25,860
Makes me a little nervous

2627
05:20:28,420 --> 05:20:32,980
I feel like people don't really know what I do when they just follow it or the sake of following it

2628
05:20:38,340 --> 05:20:40,340
So I'm like, okay

2629
05:20:48,180 --> 05:20:53,380
So I'm just like, uh gets me nervous having more eyes on me gets me a little nervous

2630
05:20:54,260 --> 05:20:56,820
And it's not really for the things that I really

2631
05:20:57,460 --> 05:21:03,540
Do does that make sense? So and I also hate twitter. I also hate twitter

2632
05:21:04,980 --> 05:21:07,620
With a burning passion

2633
05:21:13,460 --> 05:21:15,700
I got really big burning passion

2634
05:21:17,860 --> 05:21:19,860
Ah

2635
05:21:24,020 --> 05:21:35,300
So I just follow it to to see all of the fan art and your interactions and stuff and look at cute art

2636
05:21:41,140 --> 05:21:43,140
Does management force me to use it

2637
05:21:43,300 --> 05:21:47,300
It is a part of

2638
05:21:48,740 --> 05:21:50,740
Like

2639
05:21:50,980 --> 05:21:57,940
The tasks that you know the tasks that is assigned to me, but there I wouldn't say force

2640
05:21:58,740 --> 05:22:00,740
I wouldn't say force

2641
05:22:09,220 --> 05:22:11,620
I wouldn't say force just encouraged

2642
05:22:13,860 --> 05:22:17,780
If I ever want to break I can literally just be like I can't do this right now

2643
05:22:18,900 --> 05:22:25,540
But it's important as a vtuber because that is like the main place where I can interact with other vtubers and

2644
05:22:26,420 --> 05:22:32,980
Uh advertise and post my schedules and pretty much it's it's the social media hub

2645
05:22:33,620 --> 05:22:35,620
or vtubers

2646
05:22:37,300 --> 05:22:41,460
And in order to keep up with other vtubers as well and their lives as well so

2647
05:22:42,420 --> 05:22:47,460
It's good for a bunch of things. I just I just really don't like it as

2648
05:22:50,500 --> 05:22:52,500
As a social media

2649
05:22:53,700 --> 05:22:55,700
Thing to

2650
05:22:57,540 --> 05:23:05,060
To deal with yeah, can we force manage and to filter it first? I already forced manage and to filter a lot of things for me

2651
05:23:05,140 --> 05:23:07,140
So nothing

2652
05:23:07,620 --> 05:23:09,620
I

2653
05:23:11,220 --> 05:23:13,220
But I really do

2654
05:23:13,540 --> 05:23:16,180
I like that, uh twitter has

2655
05:23:17,060 --> 05:23:19,540
If you hit the algorithm, right?

2656
05:23:20,900 --> 05:23:22,900
that

2657
05:23:24,100 --> 05:23:26,100
That um

2658
05:23:27,700 --> 05:23:33,700
That a lot of new faces, uh get to see me and I get to have new senpais

2659
05:23:37,860 --> 05:23:44,260
So, yeah, I technically don't like

2660
05:23:45,860 --> 05:23:48,660
Twitter and I do hate it. I really hate it like every time

2661
05:23:49,060 --> 05:23:53,060
I'm just like every time I find out about something. It's against my will

2662
05:23:55,220 --> 05:24:02,440
Everything has been against my will for example. I learned everything about the Kardashians against my will on twitter

2663
05:24:07,460 --> 05:24:09,460
Like

2664
05:24:10,020 --> 05:24:13,700
I'm just like, yeah, I know their family dynamics

2665
05:24:15,220 --> 05:24:18,260
Not by choice. I didn't search it out myself. It just found me

2666
05:24:27,780 --> 05:24:32,020
Or like it will it will like literally give me things that I

2667
05:24:32,740 --> 05:24:35,940
Or like it will show me really depressing stuff

2668
05:24:36,660 --> 05:24:41,700
And I'm just not into that or like a bunch of rage bait stuff and I'm just like

2669
05:24:51,940 --> 05:24:56,340
Isn't every social media platform like that you could guess why I'm really offline

2670
05:24:58,020 --> 05:25:00,020
I'm super offline

2671
05:25:00,260 --> 05:25:02,260
So

2672
05:25:05,060 --> 05:25:08,740
But I keep I keep you all very close as well

2673
05:25:10,500 --> 05:25:15,300
I I constantly the only things I always check is um

2674
05:25:16,500 --> 05:25:18,100
twitter

2675
05:25:18,100 --> 05:25:20,900
and twitter your your twitter replies

2676
05:25:21,860 --> 05:25:23,860
and

2677
05:25:23,860 --> 05:25:25,860
comments

2678
05:25:25,940 --> 05:25:28,660
And even then uh comments can get filtered so

2679
05:25:29,620 --> 05:25:31,620
now

2680
05:25:33,540 --> 05:25:36,420
I I say that as I'm like a very

2681
05:25:37,060 --> 05:25:40,260
I'm a very social person amongst my like group of friends

2682
05:25:41,060 --> 05:25:45,620
But like in terms of like social media stuff. I'm not very social. I don't even go

2683
05:25:46,260 --> 05:25:47,940
I don't go clubbing

2684
05:25:47,940 --> 05:25:51,300
I'm gonna parties. There's a party. It's only like

2685
05:25:52,580 --> 05:25:54,580
A movie watching party

2686
05:25:55,540 --> 05:25:57,540
YouTube comments. I mean yeah youtube comments

2687
05:25:59,380 --> 05:26:05,780
So those are the only places I kind of look at

2688
05:26:11,140 --> 05:26:15,540
Those are the only places I look at and then I guess my only use of social media

2689
05:26:16,660 --> 05:26:19,220
It's like scrolling through pin trust

2690
05:26:20,660 --> 05:26:22,660
It's like scrolling

2691
05:26:22,740 --> 05:26:28,100
Uh through pin trust and stuff. You never joined a club after school. I've joined many clubs after school

2692
05:26:28,660 --> 05:26:32,420
I was in the drama club. I was in the newspaper club

2693
05:26:34,260 --> 05:26:36,260
Uh

2694
05:26:36,660 --> 05:26:38,660
I was in the uh

2695
05:26:39,460 --> 05:26:41,460
Book club

2696
05:26:42,500 --> 05:26:44,500
I was also

2697
05:26:44,980 --> 05:26:48,420
And then in university I was in

2698
05:26:49,220 --> 05:26:50,740
another

2699
05:26:50,740 --> 05:26:53,460
I was in a kind of like nerdy club

2700
05:26:54,260 --> 05:26:56,260
And then I was also in

2701
05:26:59,060 --> 05:27:01,060
a

2702
05:27:11,220 --> 05:27:14,820
Fighting game club. I'm trying to remember

2703
05:27:21,620 --> 05:27:23,620
I'm trying to remember what else

2704
05:27:29,620 --> 05:27:34,580
Eh, I don't quite remember if I if I joined anything else

2705
05:27:38,660 --> 05:27:42,420
Do I wear glasses? Um, I just bought glasses

2706
05:27:42,900 --> 05:27:48,420
I just recently spent some money on going to the optometrist and getting glasses

2707
05:27:48,500 --> 05:27:51,460
So I have brand new glasses that I'm still getting used to

2708
05:27:52,260 --> 05:27:54,260
I

2709
05:27:57,380 --> 05:28:01,140
Yeah, those are the uh, what do you call it? Yeah, those were the clubs I joined

2710
05:28:05,940 --> 05:28:09,220
I I had like a lot of extracurricular activities

2711
05:28:16,660 --> 05:28:18,420
But yeah

2712
05:28:18,420 --> 05:28:23,460
But when I mean clubbing I mean like going to the club like the party club and like

2713
05:28:24,660 --> 05:28:26,660
Whoa loud music

2714
05:28:26,980 --> 05:28:28,980
because uh, frankly, uh

2715
05:28:29,060 --> 05:28:30,820
the

2716
05:28:30,820 --> 05:28:32,820
I don't like music

2717
05:28:33,220 --> 05:28:35,220
I don't listen to music

2718
05:28:35,300 --> 05:28:37,940
And so does loud music bothers me

2719
05:28:41,620 --> 05:28:43,620
I also don't like drinking alcohol

2720
05:28:43,700 --> 05:28:45,700
I

2721
05:28:47,300 --> 05:28:51,940
Also don't like bass. I don't like feet rumbling. I don't like loud sounds

2722
05:28:54,420 --> 05:28:56,420
Is it the tism speaking? Probably

2723
05:28:57,060 --> 05:28:59,060
I

2724
05:29:12,740 --> 05:29:20,020
Only been clubbing like twice and then I went in and then

2725
05:29:21,540 --> 05:29:24,260
Like I only spent like 15 minutes there and then left

2726
05:29:26,500 --> 05:29:31,860
And they're like, oh my gosh, but now we are we are so tired

2727
05:29:35,940 --> 05:29:40,260
We are so tired of like clubs and stuff and they cost money to enter so

2728
05:29:45,940 --> 05:29:47,940
Nah

2729
05:29:51,380 --> 05:29:53,220
How are those new IEMs they're great

2730
05:29:53,940 --> 05:29:58,820
They sound really good and they're really comfy. Uh, they get a little bassy sometimes

2731
05:29:59,940 --> 05:30:01,540
so

2732
05:30:01,540 --> 05:30:03,540
um

2733
05:30:06,100 --> 05:30:07,300
So

2734
05:30:07,300 --> 05:30:08,820
It gets some ears rumble

2735
05:30:08,820 --> 05:30:15,780
But like I was listening to the dot hack LSD on repeat because that's how I am as a person

2736
05:30:16,420 --> 05:30:21,780
Uh, and I was like, oh, this sounds really nice. I don't know. It kind of sounds like what music sounds like to me

2737
05:30:24,100 --> 05:30:25,780
I guess

2738
05:30:25,780 --> 05:30:27,780
I don't know sound

2739
05:30:28,260 --> 05:30:37,620
Sounds like it's not like oh, this is amazing. I can hear the auto and the soprano and the the

2740
05:30:38,180 --> 05:30:40,180
whatever

2741
05:30:42,340 --> 05:30:46,740
So well, it's more like, you know, oh this wasn't to listen to

2742
05:30:49,860 --> 05:30:52,340
It's pleasant to listen to

2743
05:30:54,180 --> 05:31:00,820
Can you hear the creamy notes? I don't I still don't really know what that means

2744
05:31:02,820 --> 05:31:07,940
Anytime it's like, oh, it's a bright sparkly tone. I'm like, okay

2745
05:31:08,100 --> 05:31:10,100
I kind of I kind of get it

2746
05:31:10,180 --> 05:31:14,740
But also do you really have to say it like this every single time?

2747
05:31:15,540 --> 05:31:16,340
like

2748
05:31:16,340 --> 05:31:18,340
I don't know

2749
05:31:18,740 --> 05:31:22,100
What is creamy notes apparently it's like higher pitch notes

2750
05:31:23,380 --> 05:31:25,380
And

2751
05:31:26,260 --> 05:31:28,260
It just bothered me

2752
05:31:29,220 --> 05:31:38,180
It just bothers me. It's like, oh, yes this uh, the the audio is here is very thick and uh

2753
05:31:44,660 --> 05:31:51,220
And the it sounds so bright and I don't know they use a lot of like words

2754
05:31:54,180 --> 05:32:00,020
That that are just like these are very descriptive, but they don't mean shit to me

2755
05:32:01,380 --> 05:32:06,020
I'm not an audiophile. So this doesn't mean anything to me. Does it sound good or not?

2756
05:32:09,060 --> 05:32:12,020
Can I ask when you open morrows again, um

2757
05:32:14,660 --> 05:32:21,220
Regularly unlikely, um if they're an event I'll announce when when they're open

2758
05:32:24,020 --> 05:32:26,020
I

2759
05:32:27,620 --> 05:32:35,140
I'll announce when they're open, but morrow is being like a regular thing that's open. Um, probably not

2760
05:32:39,300 --> 05:32:41,300
Probably not, um

2761
05:32:46,100 --> 05:32:49,540
Our fanfics allowed fanfics can be posted under arson stabs

2762
05:32:53,700 --> 05:32:55,700
You

2763
05:33:00,100 --> 05:33:03,940
Like an open for 24 hours kind of thing for events. Yeah, only events though

2764
05:33:06,020 --> 05:33:08,820
People ruin it for real senpai's honestly, um

2765
05:33:10,420 --> 05:33:16,740
Yeah, people just ruin everything. I think the anon anonymity of it causes people to forget

2766
05:33:17,460 --> 05:33:18,580
uh

2767
05:33:18,580 --> 05:33:20,180
the manners

2768
05:33:20,180 --> 05:33:22,180
and even after uh

2769
05:33:24,180 --> 05:33:30,420
Even after that I'm it's probably going to be heavily or at least

2770
05:33:31,780 --> 05:33:37,860
Uh, you know at a glance it's going to be it was going to go through management first

2771
05:33:38,500 --> 05:33:40,500
Sorry, that's how it is

2772
05:33:44,900 --> 05:33:46,900
That's how it is

2773
05:33:54,180 --> 05:33:56,180
That's just how it is

2774
05:33:57,220 --> 05:33:59,220
I'm not going to open myself to

2775
05:34:00,340 --> 05:34:02,100
to anyone

2776
05:34:02,100 --> 05:34:03,380
trying to

2777
05:34:03,380 --> 05:34:05,380
Trying to be like

2778
05:34:10,500 --> 05:34:13,860
You know, I just I just like I don't have time for that. So

2779
05:34:14,580 --> 05:34:16,100
It's one thing

2780
05:34:16,100 --> 05:34:20,580
Uh off my mind and I don't have to worry about and also I felt very pressured

2781
05:34:21,220 --> 05:34:25,460
to reply to everyone and it was

2782
05:34:26,340 --> 05:34:32,100
A lot because I was getting like thousands each day and if not hundred like hundreds and thousands

2783
05:34:32,740 --> 05:34:35,540
So it was it was tough to keep up. Sorry senpai

2784
05:34:36,980 --> 05:34:41,140
I can only I can only do so much otherwise. It's like an all day thing

2785
05:34:44,580 --> 05:34:49,940
Otherwise it's like an all day thing and I cannot I I I can only focus on

2786
05:34:50,740 --> 05:34:52,740
streaming and

2787
05:34:52,820 --> 05:34:57,940
Uh like events and stuff other I can't do it. I can't do it. I don't know how my how my

2788
05:34:58,660 --> 05:35:02,980
Gen mates do it because they are amazing people. Um, I can't do it

2789
05:35:11,300 --> 05:35:17,140
Sometimes the hundreds are spams are spam. Uh, so I don't want to deal with that

2790
05:35:17,460 --> 05:35:22,340
It's a lot of work for me to deal with it's another layer of work that I don't want to do

2791
05:35:29,060 --> 05:35:31,540
And it's just like I don't want to do it. I'm sick of it

2792
05:35:37,060 --> 05:35:43,700
I'm sick of it. So the only times that will it will be open will be very specific events are

2793
05:35:44,660 --> 05:35:52,020
Maybe milestones who knows? Um, but otherwise I am a sensitive baby

2794
05:35:56,660 --> 05:36:00,500
You know, I'm a sensitive baby and I will probably kill you

2795
05:36:03,300 --> 05:36:06,340
And I will probably kill you or find ways to be like

2796
05:36:07,300 --> 05:36:09,300
Bye. Bye

2797
05:36:13,700 --> 05:36:15,700
So

2798
05:36:23,140 --> 05:36:28,260
Honestly a lot of the the things that I do are also for safety reasons as well. So

2799
05:36:29,140 --> 05:36:34,900
Uh, I'm pretty paranoid about my safety and like making sure I don't dox myself. So

2800
05:36:39,220 --> 05:36:40,500
So

2801
05:36:40,500 --> 05:36:43,060
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do do shit

2802
05:36:44,420 --> 05:36:46,420
To risk it

2803
05:36:49,700 --> 05:36:54,020
So, yeah, I care about my safety and I care about your safety too senpai so

2804
05:36:56,020 --> 05:37:01,860
So if you see any shitters, uh, just ignore them and pretend they don't exist

2805
05:37:04,420 --> 05:37:08,660
And the one thing I hate about the shitters though is that

2806
05:37:09,940 --> 05:37:11,940
They just make shit up

2807
05:37:12,340 --> 05:37:16,500
They make shit up and then everyone believes them and I'm like, what the fuck?

2808
05:37:26,100 --> 05:37:28,420
Lying on the internet, wow

2809
05:37:32,980 --> 05:37:35,700
I don't know people just don't double check fax or anything

2810
05:37:36,660 --> 05:37:42,500
When I had maros open I had a lot of people accuse me of a lot of things

2811
05:37:45,060 --> 05:37:48,260
And I was like, uh, what?

2812
05:37:52,820 --> 05:38:03,060
And then I got hate and my maros for things where they're like, I heard you did this and this on your debut you're disgusting and I'm like

2813
05:38:03,140 --> 05:38:09,300
This is easily easily verifiable

2814
05:38:12,580 --> 05:38:14,580
Easily verifiable

2815
05:38:20,340 --> 05:38:22,340
It's like, oh you don't even watch

2816
05:38:29,620 --> 05:38:32,260
So I'm just like, okay, whatever

2817
05:38:33,540 --> 05:38:40,100
Anyways, that is mostly a reason why and which is why a reason why, um

2818
05:38:44,020 --> 05:38:51,060
Most likely fansly when it, sorry fansly when it does come out

2819
05:38:53,540 --> 05:38:55,540
Um

2820
05:38:56,260 --> 05:38:58,260
Will be paywalled

2821
05:38:59,540 --> 05:39:09,940
I'm actually, since I have the most experience with that site, I'm actually the one that's going to help out everyone set theirs up

2822
05:39:16,580 --> 05:39:23,220
Which should be should be relatively easy and but there's a few things that's gonna be

2823
05:39:24,180 --> 05:39:31,780
Um, that's gonna be a little bit, uh, that's gonna take time to set up because it's just finicky

2824
05:39:38,260 --> 05:39:44,900
It's just finicky, but uh, yeah, I think I have the most experience with that site since

2825
05:39:47,140 --> 05:39:51,300
I played games on it like a nerd. I just went

2826
05:39:52,100 --> 05:39:56,020
Yeah, let's play this eddle gay

2827
05:40:03,860 --> 05:40:05,860
That's all I did

2828
05:40:08,260 --> 05:40:12,820
I voiced it too. Yeah, I voiced it too, but yeah, that's all I did

2829
05:40:13,620 --> 05:40:16,100
I really liked it. That was the most fun I had

2830
05:40:17,140 --> 05:40:18,260
um

2831
05:40:18,260 --> 05:40:21,060
Like in all of streaming ever

2832
05:40:23,860 --> 05:40:26,820
That's all that's the most fun I ever had

2833
05:40:27,380 --> 05:40:32,580
So that's why when I joined viola, I was like, please let me play it. Okay

2834
05:40:39,860 --> 05:40:41,860
Well, you were in one of those games

2835
05:40:42,260 --> 05:40:43,380
No

2836
05:40:43,460 --> 05:40:48,100
Like I just did the voices I voiced over I did the narration

2837
05:40:51,620 --> 05:40:56,740
I just like what are we doing today? Oh once upon a time there was a princess

2838
05:40:57,860 --> 05:40:59,860
Yeah

2839
05:41:08,180 --> 05:41:12,260
But yeah, I had lots of fun with it, so I'm hoping that um

2840
05:41:13,460 --> 05:41:18,820
My gen mates will also have lots of fun with it. I don't really know what they're planning, but I know what I'm planning

2841
05:41:22,260 --> 05:41:24,260
And it's pretty much gonna be

2842
05:41:26,180 --> 05:41:29,300
It's pretty much going to be pretty much that

2843
05:41:31,700 --> 05:41:35,780
Speaking of games to your voice the violaer games, this is a lot of questions

2844
05:41:37,060 --> 05:41:40,260
There's a lot of questions. I'm gonna have to have to

2845
05:41:41,300 --> 05:41:42,900
um

2846
05:41:42,900 --> 05:41:48,980
Have to limit some more questions because I gotta go to sleep soon. Um, are there any voice parts in the violaer game? Yes

2847
05:41:57,380 --> 05:42:00,100
There are some special scenes that you can get too

2848
05:42:00,740 --> 05:42:02,740
You

2849
05:42:10,980 --> 05:42:13,700
Game is free, right? Yes, it should be free

2850
05:42:22,580 --> 05:42:25,140
So yeah, it should be free and

2851
05:42:25,300 --> 05:42:27,300
And

2852
05:42:27,620 --> 05:42:30,020
It's still in the works. I think there's some things that

2853
05:42:30,740 --> 05:42:37,220
Were streamlined, but then there was delays in it. I think I'm not really sure mostly strani knows all this stuff

2854
05:42:37,620 --> 05:42:40,260
I'm just kind of here being like just tell me what to do

2855
05:42:44,180 --> 05:42:48,980
Just tell me what to do and then yeah, it's fun. It should be it should be free

2856
05:42:49,700 --> 05:42:51,860
Please be 18 plus to play it

2857
05:42:55,300 --> 05:43:01,540
So I'm not sure are you gonna play through it too?

2858
05:43:06,740 --> 05:43:08,740
Maybe it has to be on the other side

2859
05:43:10,340 --> 05:43:12,340
Maybe it depends

2860
05:43:13,540 --> 05:43:15,300
It depends

2861
05:43:15,300 --> 05:43:20,260
It depends on what strani wants. I'm sorry. It depends on what management and strani wants me to do

2862
05:43:21,220 --> 05:43:27,060
Because if strani's like nah, you shouldn't spoil it. They should play it for themselves. I'll be like, okay

2863
05:43:28,820 --> 05:43:30,820
Or

2864
05:43:31,540 --> 05:43:32,660
If

2865
05:43:32,660 --> 05:43:38,580
Or if you know strani says go play it go go promote it. I'll be like, okay. Honestly. I'm just a yes, man

2866
05:43:39,700 --> 05:43:43,480

05:43:50,660 --> 05:43:57,860
Like honestly, I'm just like so thankful to be here that I'm just like yes, whatever you want, mommy

2868
05:43:57,860 --> 05:43:59,860
Okay

2869
05:44:16,260 --> 05:44:21,700
Although there are some parts where I'm like mommy, I don't think that's smart or mommy. I don't know about that

2870
05:44:23,060 --> 05:44:25,060
But yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty like

2871
05:44:25,060 --> 05:44:30,820
Yes, ma'am, whatever you want ma'am right away ma'am

2872
05:44:37,060 --> 05:44:39,860
That's pretty much uh, yeah

2873
05:44:46,820 --> 05:44:51,460
So yeah, as long as management tells me what to do, I'll be like, yeah, I'll do it

2874
05:44:56,020 --> 05:45:02,660
I'm pretty much I'm pretty much uh, I'm very thankful for where I am

2875
05:45:05,700 --> 05:45:09,940
I'm very thankful for what I am for where I am not what I am gosh

2876
05:45:10,980 --> 05:45:12,980
I'm mixing out my questions

2877
05:45:13,620 --> 05:45:16,100
I wear for how who and what

2878
05:45:17,540 --> 05:45:23,220
I'm I'm thankful for where I am. So I owe it all to strani for giving me the opportunity

2879
05:45:25,220 --> 05:45:27,220
and

2880
05:45:27,380 --> 05:45:29,380
Yeah

2881
05:45:33,140 --> 05:45:37,940
Yeah, so I'm just like yeah, I'm I'm the only thing I'm just like

2882
05:45:39,140 --> 05:45:43,220
I want I want I want to play the arrow gay

2883
05:45:48,260 --> 05:45:50,260
I want to play the arrow gay so that's

2884
05:45:51,620 --> 05:45:53,620
I need I need so yeah

2885
05:45:54,340 --> 05:45:56,340
Um, most likely it will be pay walled

2886
05:45:57,460 --> 05:46:00,900
I'm going to whatever the whatever my gen mates

2887
05:46:01,620 --> 05:46:08,580
Uh threshold cost of it is I'm going to match or like be in between their costs

2888
05:46:10,500 --> 05:46:13,700
Just so so it's uh

2889
05:46:16,580 --> 05:46:19,540
Just so it's kind of fair to the other girls as well

2890
05:46:20,100 --> 05:46:22,100
I

2891
05:46:22,660 --> 05:46:27,540
I'm not sure about like the full plans like all of it's going to be discussed like later

2892
05:46:28,180 --> 05:46:34,180
Uh, like when we get like perms like there's going to be like a whole meeting and then I'll get all the details there

2893
05:46:36,500 --> 05:46:45,060
I'll get all the details there and then I'll have a better idea to prepare for for pretty much when it's going to happen

2894
05:46:50,500 --> 05:46:52,500
But yeah, I think I think

2895
05:46:53,460 --> 05:47:00,100
I think pretty much uh, well, what's the thing like morrow's only gonna happen for special occasions. Uh

2896
05:47:01,940 --> 05:47:03,940
Anything else

2897
05:47:06,260 --> 05:47:08,900
Is there anything else that I need to cover

2898
05:47:08,900 --> 05:47:10,900
I

2899
05:47:16,340 --> 05:47:18,340
Don't think so

2900
05:47:18,340 --> 05:47:23,540
But yeah, I'm glad to be here. Oh, uh, aside from my vacation keep each other accountable

2901
05:47:30,420 --> 05:47:37,460
Keep each other accountable. I love scrawny. I also love all my gen mates like love love love love love love love love love love love them

2902
05:47:39,540 --> 05:47:43,380
Voice stuff for the game has been answered. Yeah, it's gonna be fully voiced by everyone

2903
05:47:45,220 --> 05:47:47,220
Um

2904
05:47:50,100 --> 05:47:55,380

I'm going to test it out

2906
05:48:02,820 --> 05:48:04,820
And

2907
05:48:05,620 --> 05:48:12,900
If some pies like it better than I'll keep the time I also have to keep in mind how I feel as well because

2908
05:48:14,660 --> 05:48:22,660
Because if I'm more exhausted at that time or I feel more rushed I might change it back or final find like a midway point

2909
05:48:26,180 --> 05:48:32,020
But yeah, I love all my I love all my gen mates every single one of them. I think they're great

2910
05:48:35,460 --> 05:48:37,460
I may not talk to them every day

2911
05:48:38,260 --> 05:48:39,780
because

2912
05:48:39,780 --> 05:48:44,260
Because uh, we're all we're all busy people right we're all busy people

2913

05:49:17,220 --> 05:49:22,340
My gen mate uh-oh I I noticed by the way it was so rare random, but I was like, oh

2919
05:49:23,780 --> 05:49:26,980
If you like look at our names, we kind of spell like our

2920
05:49:27,700 --> 05:49:32,340
Like the letters first letter of our names kind of spell like a miss

2921
05:49:35,780 --> 05:49:41,940
Strongest yapper and veal or probably strongy

2922
05:49:49,220 --> 05:49:51,220
Probably strongy

2923
05:49:53,460 --> 05:49:58,900
Maybe she be maybe me. I don't know. I think we're all pretty strong yappers

2924
05:49:59,780 --> 05:50:04,420
I think we're all pretty strong yappers

2925
05:50:08,420 --> 05:50:10,820
I feel like I just yeah too much

2926
05:50:22,100 --> 05:50:26,740
So I'm just like, uh, I I would put myself up there too, but

2927
05:50:27,220 --> 05:50:30,340
I also want to just put the girls first

2928
05:50:36,500 --> 05:50:40,900
Cause that makes sense. I think everyone's pretty good yappers

2929
05:50:44,020 --> 05:50:46,020
Yeah, I think everyone's pretty good at yapping

2930
05:50:46,900 --> 05:50:52,980
Sometimes when I pop into their stream, I'm just like what the heck are they talking about and they steep they're keep on going

2931
05:50:53,140 --> 05:51:01,140
But yeah, I want to kind of put the girls first because I don't know I love them so much, right?

2932
05:51:03,460 --> 05:51:05,460
I love my girls so much

2933
05:51:12,900 --> 05:51:14,900
No

2934
05:51:15,860 --> 05:51:17,860
I

2935
05:51:19,620 --> 05:51:21,620
Think that's it um

2936
05:51:21,860 --> 05:51:26,980
I hope I haven't kept you all awake for too long. I know it's

2937
05:51:27,860 --> 05:51:31,060
Leading into the next day or it could be like, uh

2938
05:51:32,100 --> 05:51:36,900
Early early for everyone. So I hope I know that Mondays are a little harsh

2939
05:51:39,460 --> 05:51:41,460
So

2940
05:51:41,860 --> 05:51:43,860
Let's take a look at what we have

2941
05:51:44,980 --> 05:51:49,620
If anyone's on nobody's on so therefore I will end it here

2942
05:51:51,940 --> 05:51:56,740
I am so tired. I don't want to wake up early again for yoga

2943
05:52:01,060 --> 05:52:07,620
So I hope that answers everyone's question. Sorry for for uh yapping a little a little long

2944
05:52:08,740 --> 05:52:12,020
But I love you all very very much

2945
05:52:12,180 --> 05:52:14,180
So

2946
05:52:16,260 --> 05:52:19,780
I'll see you again next time. Okay

2947
05:52:21,540 --> 05:52:24,040
Scream for mercy. Bye. Bye
