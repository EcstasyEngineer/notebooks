1
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:57,680
it's always one heartbreak after another there are people who just love the

2
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,640
drama of relationship but I don't think anyone specifically pines for heartbreak

3
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:10,120
I mean I always give my best I try to be more than fair as a girlfriend but

4
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,800
sometimes I get nit thinking that somehow it's all my fault I just can't

5
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,160
wrap my head around how that could be possible it's times like this where I

6
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,640
try to think back to the start of my love life starting with my first love and

7
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:33,560
first loss maybe try to compare and see where I went wrong this time it started

8
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,040
back in early college I was studying to become a fashion designer if you can

9
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:45,920
believe that I wasn't as well deliciously brazen in my outfit choices as I am now

10
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,920
a quiet much too overlooked girl who never got invited to parties their loss

11
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,320
though I imagine I had more fun sewing crafting and anything else a grandma

12
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,120
would do with spare time an old soul people would call me I was content in

13
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:11,920
my own quiet that was until I met my first love I don't know what he saw in

14
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,720
me but he was the one to make the first move even before I had the mind

15
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,960
to dress to attract the male gaze here I was more of an all-miss chic ghost

16
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:29,040
whatever the reason here was a man who takes charge where he needs to he was

17
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,320
a dirty rabid-looking man who stank of booze and ooze failure and degeneracy in

18
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,920
retrospect in our first meeting it was a bit more pushy than I'm used to

19
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,800
nowadays it's best to understand that the pillar of a strong relationship is

20
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,720
setting up boundaries and it's best to do it as soon as possible putting your

21
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,520
foot down telling your partner what's what it's a risk you have to take it was

22
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,560
because of that I remember that I always keep my fabric scissors with me when

23
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,560
you interact with your partner honestly if the love is true they can feel your

24
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,920
intent that's when the honest purest part of them comes out my favorite stage

25
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,400
in all of my relationships it was like he was a completely different person

26
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,560
from his introduction he showed me his true self a part men are taught to hide

27
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,440
away the soft sweet vulnerable man inside I mean how could I not fall for him I

28
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,540
don't think I have a particular type per se but a man who expresses his

29
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,320
emotions in such a delicious way that's something I couldn't resist I just had

30
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,920
to have him I had brought him to an old shed my family owns the best I could do

31
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,040
at the time but together our love can make it all you see good relationships

32
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,840
are built on compromise and I and compromise I did I gave that man

33
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:04,120
everything everything you could ever want I bathed him fed him cared for him

34
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,320
gave myself to him the time we spent I gave him all I had to give that's what

35
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,360
relationships are I give and take you give your all to someone and you expect

36
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,960
them to do the same for you and you know what he does just runs away out of the

37
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,160
blue no talking no indication anything is wrong just leaves I couldn't

38
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,560
understand I was high off of my affection for him and I thought he was

39
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,000
the same but I had to hold in my sadness I for one am better than leaving

40
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,880
without a word relationships no matter what should be ended properly after all

41
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,840
sometimes relationships don't work out for reasons you don't understand but

42
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,760
where there was true love there can be a lot of fun to be had right before

43
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,600
cutting ties

44
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,200
after that it was fling after fling a new love here and there all ending the

45
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,960
same way I hate having to be the nice one in the relationship it can't be my

46
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,680
fault I guess men will take any chance to abuse your kindness now the breakup

47
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,480
songs on the radio start to make sense and the sweetest sugars are now as

48
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,760
bitter as vinegar it's times like this when I think I'm about to give up on

49
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:39,680
love entirely but as they say time heals all wounds after that it feels like

50
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,560
the very first time

51
00:13:43,560 --> 00:14:02,560
wake up Senpai Senpai wake up oh you're still a bit dizzy that's okay I hit

52

53
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:17,640
a lot of time together welcome Senpai I finally have you I've been waiting for

114
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,520
for my senpais to know because weaknesses are have to be shared with each

115
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:39,240
other so my weakness is motion sickness I'm sorry that's that is why most of my

116
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,080
games are like that I have very bad motion sickness that I'm trying to get

117
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,560
over impatient I mean sorry that's the third thing in the way overthinking I

118
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,400
tend to overthink a lot and if things are too simple I might in puzzles I might

119
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,080
overthink them and just go like no it can't be that simple and of course in

120
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:08,720
patience I'm I'm a little impatient with a lot of things so please forgive me

121
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:19,120
after all we all have weaknesses all right okay okay here are my goals senpai

149
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:34,600
first impressions of my gen mates is that in me is surprisingly hick but in a

150
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,880
cute way baby girl can be quite ruthless super talented at everything she does

151
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:48,720
has no weaknesses and she's super funny she's a she's a super memer I see when

152

I first saw her I thought she would be super messy get key and guess what I was

153
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,520
right she's a baby polar bear would protect but she'll probably bite me

154
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,040
actually the cutest as I said she doesn't have the best food takes I think

155
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:17,080
that she likes she has really good food and she's a really passionate and

156
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,960
amazing DJ you guys saw that set right so good and then there's mommy

157
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,160
mommy sometimes I'm scared of her not gonna lie sometimes I'm scared of her

158
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:36,280
but I feel very loved she's easygoing as much as she doesn't say she's like she

159
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,640
says that she's not professional I believe she's super professional as well

160
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:48,840
and she's very clumsy but in a like a super cute way she be she be is so brave

161
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,840
like everything is waters off the ducks back very independent cool independent

162
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,200
woman she's a hard worker maybe she works too hard she has such a wide range in

163
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,880
her voice as well so I think that's really cool that she's like able to reach

164
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,480
different voice tones that's that's really amazing

165
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:20,280
Azura right here is I thought she was a dancer when I first saw her because of

166
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,880
her colors or like a fortune teller she is mommy like that's it she's mommy that's

167
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,640
it her voice is very good I have never heard a voice so so dripping and like
