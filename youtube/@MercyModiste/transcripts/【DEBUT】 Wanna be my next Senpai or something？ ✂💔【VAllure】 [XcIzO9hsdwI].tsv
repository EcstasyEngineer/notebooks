510000	537680	it's always one heartbreak after another there are people who just love the
537680	542640	drama of relationship but I don't think anyone specifically pines for heartbreak
542640	550120	I mean I always give my best I try to be more than fair as a girlfriend but
550120	555800	sometimes I get nit thinking that somehow it's all my fault I just can't
555800	560160	wrap my head around how that could be possible it's times like this where I
560160	565640	try to think back to the start of my love life starting with my first love and
565640	573560	first loss maybe try to compare and see where I went wrong this time it started
573560	578040	back in early college I was studying to become a fashion designer if you can
578040	585920	believe that I wasn't as well deliciously brazen in my outfit choices as I am now
585920	591920	a quiet much too overlooked girl who never got invited to parties their loss
591920	597320	though I imagine I had more fun sewing crafting and anything else a grandma
597320	603120	would do with spare time an old soul people would call me I was content in
603120	611920	my own quiet that was until I met my first love I don't know what he saw in
611920	616720	me but he was the one to make the first move even before I had the mind
616720	621960	to dress to attract the male gaze here I was more of an all-miss chic ghost
621960	629040	whatever the reason here was a man who takes charge where he needs to he was
629040	635320	a dirty rabid-looking man who stank of booze and ooze failure and degeneracy in
635320	639920	retrospect in our first meeting it was a bit more pushy than I'm used to
639920	644800	nowadays it's best to understand that the pillar of a strong relationship is
644800	649720	setting up boundaries and it's best to do it as soon as possible putting your
649720	654520	foot down telling your partner what's what it's a risk you have to take it was
654520	660560	because of that I remember that I always keep my fabric scissors with me when
660560	665560	you interact with your partner honestly if the love is true they can feel your
665560	671920	intent that's when the honest purest part of them comes out my favorite stage
671920	677400	in all of my relationships it was like he was a completely different person
677400	682560	from his introduction he showed me his true self a part men are taught to hide
682560	689440	away the soft sweet vulnerable man inside I mean how could I not fall for him I
689440	694540	don't think I have a particular type per se but a man who expresses his
694540	699320	emotions in such a delicious way that's something I couldn't resist I just had
699360	704920	to have him I had brought him to an old shed my family owns the best I could do
704920	711040	at the time but together our love can make it all you see good relationships
711040	717840	are built on compromise and I and compromise I did I gave that man
717840	724120	everything everything you could ever want I bathed him fed him cared for him
724240	730320	gave myself to him the time we spent I gave him all I had to give that's what
730320	735360	relationships are I give and take you give your all to someone and you expect
735360	741960	them to do the same for you and you know what he does just runs away out of the
741960	748160	blue no talking no indication anything is wrong just leaves I couldn't
748160	752560	understand I was high off of my affection for him and I thought he was
752560	759000	the same but I had to hold in my sadness I for one am better than leaving
759000	765880	without a word relationships no matter what should be ended properly after all
765880	770840	sometimes relationships don't work out for reasons you don't understand but
770840	776760	where there was true love there can be a lot of fun to be had right before
776760	780600	cutting ties
783560	790200	after that it was fling after fling a new love here and there all ending the
790200	797960	same way I hate having to be the nice one in the relationship it can't be my
797960	803680	fault I guess men will take any chance to abuse your kindness now the breakup
803680	807480	songs on the radio start to make sense and the sweetest sugars are now as
807480	811760	bitter as vinegar it's times like this when I think I'm about to give up on
811760	819680	love entirely but as they say time heals all wounds after that it feels like
819680	823560	the very first time
823560	842560	wake up Senpai Senpai wake up oh you're still a bit dizzy that's okay I hit
842560	848600	you on the head pretty hard up an atom though it's a shame but we don't have
848600	857640	a lot of time together welcome Senpai I finally have you I've been waiting for
857640	863360	this moment for so long and I hear you've been waiting for me too what do

1363080	1369560	over impatient I mean sorry that's the third thing in the way overthinking I
1369560	1375400	tend to overthink a lot and if things are too simple I might in puzzles I might
1375400	1381080	overthink them and just go like no it can't be that simple and of course in
1381080	1388720	patience I'm I'm a little impatient with a lot of things so please forgive me
1388720	1399120	after all we all have weaknesses all right okay okay here are my goals senpai
1399120	1404440	I have so many goals I have so many goals if I have more and I went through them
1404560	1408640	take a long time to get through so here are just a handful that I picked so my

1420880	1425000	motion sickness to play first-person games host a concert and perform 3d

1498880	1503480	clever though so if you guys could could help me if my senpai's could help me

1538320	1544480	fix that up right and the fan name for these little guys are called snippets
1544480	1549760	originally they were supposed to be called heartbreakers but I really don't

1553040	1559920	aren't they little aren't they super super adorable guy I think they're super
1559960	1572000	cute oh they're so sweet all right let's talk about my favorite thing my
1572000	1578840	gen mates aren't they super cute these are drawn in the style of set cheese like
1578840	1587440	blue archive blue archive work so they're super super funny and cute so my
1587480	1594600	first impressions of my gen mates is that in me is surprisingly hick but in a
1594600	1600880	cute way baby girl can be quite ruthless super talented at everything she does
1600880	1608720	has no weaknesses and she's super funny she's a she's a super memer I see when
1608720	1615520	I first saw her I thought she would be super messy get key and guess what I was
1615520	1622520	right she's a baby polar bear would protect but she'll probably bite me
1622520	1629040	actually the cutest as I said she doesn't have the best food takes I think
1629040	1637080	that she likes she has really good food and she's a really passionate and
1637080	1643960	amazing DJ you guys saw that set right so good and then there's mommy
1643960	1649160	mommy sometimes I'm scared of her not gonna lie sometimes I'm scared of her
1649160	1656280	but I feel very loved she's easygoing as much as she doesn't say she's like she
1656280	1659640	says that she's not professional I believe she's super professional as well
1660520	1668840	and she's very clumsy but in a like a super cute way she be she be is so brave
1668840	1674840	like everything is waters off the ducks back very independent cool independent
1674840	1682200	woman she's a hard worker maybe she works too hard she has such a wide range in
1682200	1687880	her voice as well so I think that's really cool that she's like able to reach
1688280	1691480	different voice tones that's that's really amazing
1693400	1700280	Azura right here is I thought she was a dancer when I first saw her because of
1700280	1705880	her colors or like a fortune teller she is mommy like that's it she's mommy that's
1705880	1711640	it her voice is very good I have never heard a voice so so dripping and like
