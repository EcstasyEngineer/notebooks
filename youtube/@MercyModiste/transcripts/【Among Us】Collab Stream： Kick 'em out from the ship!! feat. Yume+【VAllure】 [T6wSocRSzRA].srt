00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Oh, awesome.

199
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Who's dead?

200
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Already?

201
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Can you hear them now?

202
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
What?

203
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
It was in me.

204
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
It was Amy.

205
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Oh, my God.

206
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Amy's at the garbage chute.

207
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Amy's at the garbage chute.

208
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
I literally just saw her.

209
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
I came from the fricking.

210
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
I just came from communication.

211
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,920
And Amy is fucking standing over the body of rain.

212
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Holy crap.

213
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Holy crap.

214
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
No.

215
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Don't even fucking lie.

216
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm sorry, but you're into...

217
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
No.

218
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Is that the best...

219
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Right.

220
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Sorry.

221
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
That's the best you've got.

222
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I walked in on it.

223
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
It's literally a...

224
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
A-Y-M-E.

225
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
A-Y-M-E.

226
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
It's the Sonic Heroes...

227
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,920
It's the fucking Shadow Roleplayer.

228
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Yeah, okay.

229
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,920
The only guilty thing I have to admit is that I like Shadow,

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
but I didn't...

231
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
I didn't do this.

232
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I promise.

233
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Did Stroni set you up?

234
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Yeah, absolutely.

235
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
You gotta believe it.

236
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Hey, you up.

237
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Are you fucking having a laugh?

238
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Amy, are you joking?

239
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,920
I was literally at the gas canister, watching you as you go to pull the lever,

240
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,920
and then fucking Snape, rain in half.

241
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Her fucking torso is like left behind.

242
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I'm sorry, but that was a cute...

243
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Open up my stream.

244
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I don't know what there's anything to do with them.

245
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I don't know who to vote for.

246
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Open up.

247
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Open up my stream right now.

248
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I'm not being gaslit by selling a Sonic...

249
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,920
A fricking Shadow the Hedgehog streamer right now.

250
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
I'm not being gaslit.

251
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm not being gaslit by a fricking Sonic the Hedgehog's son.

252
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
I will say that I did see...

253
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
I did see Amy stand over the body.

254
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
The body immediately just be like,

255
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,920
fuck you now, that's not fair.

256
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Amy, I'm sorry, but you seem suspicious.

257
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Believe me, my baby girl, I would never...

259
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I would never have had a friend.

260
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm sorry, Amy.

261
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,920
If it's not Amy, I'm voting for Stroni next round.

262
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Why am I getting in trouble?

263
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Obviously it's going to say imposter.

264
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
You're welcome, Sheebie.

265
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
You're actually welcome for doing half of the work.

266
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Now you all go find the other imposter while you're at it.

267
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
I'll do it.

268
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
I'll try my best.

269
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Goddamn, Stroni, I fucking love you.

270
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
What do you mean, though?

271
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
You heard the tune, but you don't hear them.

272
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
See you in death, baby girl.

273
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
What?

274
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Oh my god, I can't believe they all...

275
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Are you guys stupid or dumb?

276
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Are you guys stupid or dumb?

277
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Yeah, she's trying to get rid of Remini.

278
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Wait, you didn't do it.

279
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
What?

280
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
You didn't do it.

281
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Stroni.

282
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Stroni.

283
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
She didn't do it.

284
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
You didn't do it?

285
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Mother.

286
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Wait, wait, Mercy...

287
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Mercy says you saw it.

288
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
You didn't do it.

289
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
No, it's not.

290
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Mercy reported.

291
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
I walked in.

292
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
I walked in.

293
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
I don't know about this.

294
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
You just walked in.

295
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
No, what?

296
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
You didn't eliminate Remini.

297
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
What?

298
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I protected you.

299
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
I'm gonna broke you my shit.

300
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
If somebody kills me, it was Stroni.

301
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Wait, but...

302
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
It was Stroni.

303
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
What?

304
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
I'm so fucking good.

305
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Mercy!

306
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Mercy, no!

307
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
I don't understand.

308
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
I did it.

309
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Wait, how did the game end?

310
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
The people were still alive.

311
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Oh, they probably double killed.

312
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
I hate you guys.

313
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,920
You knew when Stroni talks like that,

314
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
I know it's fucking her.

315
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
That's her tone.

316
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
That's her tone.

317
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Oh, Jesus.

318
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
He didn't nasty whore.

319
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Fensive, so fast.

320
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
That is Stroni's tone.

321
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Come on.

322
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
What?

323
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Wait, wait, wait.

324
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
It didn't matter.

325
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
Hold it.

326
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
It didn't matter.

327
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
If you guys hear me.

328
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Yeah?

329
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Yeah?

330
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Yeah?

331
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Yeah?

332
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Yeah?

333
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Yeah?

334
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Yeah?

335
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
I feel so betrayed.

336
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Wow, hang on.

337
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
I can't believe that this happened.

338
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
I am so hurt.

339
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
My ass home.

340
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
We're so hurt by this development.

341
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
I didn't see anything.

342
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I didn't see anything.

343
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
I didn't see anything.

344
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
I didn't see anything.

345
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Is there anything?

346
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Anything?

347
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Defense.

348
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Amy, what kind of defenses I didn't do it.

349
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
You had no alibi.

350
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Yeah?

351
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
The candlestick was in the lounge.

352
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,920
The bill yard room had the freaking pool cue in it.

353
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Like what was that alibi?

354
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
We got a pretty grand play.

355
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
I did do it.

356
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
Clue reference.

357
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
I think the world is heated.

358
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,920
I love shadow the hedgehog.

359
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,280
Eventually I was like, I'm gonna be accused by a shadow the hedgehog lover

360
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Johnny doesn't go down without a fight

361
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Hey boost begin with

362
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Oh, it's so funny

363
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,760
Oh, thank God. Hopefully this time I should be the imposter

364
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I'm coming for you Johnny

365
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,040
If you're fucking coming for me, I'm coming up you

366
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,240
I'll be a good little girl. I'll do my test

367
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,920
And it cannot be that bad

368
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:30,960
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do-do-do

369
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,760
Sorry. I just coughed in your ear. Oh my gosh. I thought you had covid. You're gonna get...

370
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,880
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's a flu here.

371
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,120
Oh, this is disgusting. Ah, you're worse than the imposter

372
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
I

373
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,580
Shadowed the hedgehog. No, no, let me talk

374
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,940
Okay, I found the body let the rabbit speak. Um, so I was doing electrical. It's coming from electrical and I walked up

375
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,440
And uh, actually, I don't know where the hell the map works. Hold on. Let me let me look at the map

376
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,340
You can walk up near and in between reactor and security

377
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
Mm-hmm. Oh

378
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:50,260
That was I mean I am I'm going to vouch for rare and pink because she was near me all the way in

379
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,280
Navigation, I saw her go in the opposite direction. So I think yeah, yeah

380
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
Yeah, she caught me like she had caught it. Oh, it's Johnny Ray

381
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,720
Rouching for one another she be claiming. She saw it. So Azura mimosa and rain y'all looking so what do you what do you guys have to

382
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,640
Say for yourselves. I

383
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Was in

384
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
It was it was not me

385
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Yeah

386
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,680
Because a strongy I was with strongy, then I went to security and I saw

387
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,840
I didn't see who killed I mean between security

388
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,960
Yeah, but I was in between security and reactor. I did see rain

389
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,920
I did see rain and admin so Azura and mimosa are now the most likely suspects unless she be you're playing mind game

390
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,680
So Azura mimosa and she be are all sus now. I'm less ventilation was taken in electrical

391
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,200
Which unfortunately I don't believe a word you say Azura

392
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,280
At the table I'm sitting at the table because I'm having audio issue

393
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Did you

394
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,920
Don't know who to vote for then I'm gonna vote for mimosa just because I love my mimosa

395
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,120
But you're the most likely target at the moment

396
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:17,120
Okay, who was the person that said they walk to security. I'm gonna skip cuz I don't know was me. I'm gonna skip

397
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
I don't know who to vote for

398
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,600
Azura and mimosa have abstained for voting. How fucking curious

399
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,840
Azura is the most fucking likely. I'm keeping an eye on Azura

400
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
He walks by

401
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
I

402
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,920
Unless it's mercy, I bet what what why me

403
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,800
Why I think she's good

404
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
It's not me

405
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
I think it's rain

406
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Very fucking curious

407
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,080
What is this wait a moment TV who was attacking you

408
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,280
Ice mercy walk by me and disappeared into the nether I do believe it might be her no

409
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,640
What was the area on the left give me the map? I

410
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,200
Was right next to you in admin. No, I was alone with rain and Rhea and scrawny

411
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,800
I was with in rain. I think it was rain. Yeah, it was rain

412
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,720
No, it's not I can't believe you would do such a thing to me

413
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Why mercy

414
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
I

415
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
Was actually aiming for rain, but I don't know how to the kill

416
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,240
Mercy walk right past me and I'm surprised you didn't kill me then cuz I was just like talking to myself

417
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,040
She shut up, I wanted to let you all live

418
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,920
Being so kind as an imposter letting you live

419
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm red not blue goddamn

420
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
They're all liars here

421
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Arbitrars

422
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
I

423
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,560
Take a break, okay, I'll come back

424
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Where did I need to go now?

425
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,160
Reactor now it's time to survive

426
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,960
Don't worry. I'll start screaming bloody murder. Is this the reactor?

427
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Yes

428
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,600
Is in frickin electrical and who does stumble upon puri Rio's dead body again?

429
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I

430
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,260
Literally open the door because the door just got closed in my face me and

431
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,840
Opens and then I mean I mean comes out and then

432
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,000
Back at the vent section and Rio's sitting dead with her weak orbs, so I

433
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Mean

434
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,000
I can't stop you

435
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Listen to me

436
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,960
She literally goes I was an electrical I tell you I find the dead body of Rio an electrical and you go

437
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
She goes I'm an electric

438
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
I

439
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Don't know

440
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,000
It also might be mimosa because no one was

441
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,640
No, I have not seen Azura, where's the where's her body probably by the table again

442
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Excuse me

443
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I

444
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,440
Mercy void for me, so when you see me

445
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,400
No, when it goes all when strong ease and I know we impose start vote mercy

446
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Mercy mercy always

447
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
He's a posture

448
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,440
If you want to lose this crew mate have fun, but I'm here at win and you guys are being daft right now

449
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
It's clearly Marys say for one

450
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
We know it's not she be

451
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,160
Right when I float away in space and it says strong he was a weak crew mate everyone turned to mercy and vote for her

452
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Thank you very much

453
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Oh my god

454
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,400
Mercy will accuse someone and vote for somebody who is who is the imposter and accusing her which is so slow to get back

455
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,040
And then strongy gets so defensive

456
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Why does she have a midget as a pet

457
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,320
Oh, I can't I can't eat so we you see a wee thing it's a wee thing. Oh, it's a wee thing

458
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,360
Who's missing who's missing it's a wee

459
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Oh mercy's got an ipad yeah, I got an ipad and she has a little heart

460
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm not sitting. Yeah. Well, I'm just having a week. I go

461
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,040
Anyway, so what I was always right. Anyway, everyone thinks I'm just so mad right now

462
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I'm so

463
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,400
I'm gonna sit in the corner and be upset. Exactly. I can't wait to murder. I crave more blood

464
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
My god, why am I imposter again?

465
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
I can still hear you I like to

466
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
You like to

467
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
I have a buddy. Hey, what's going on?

468
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,160
Yeah, just go here. No, go. No, what? Oh, you go here. I use it. Oh, you can't use it. Okay

469
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,320
Because I'm imposter I can't use it. Oh my gosh, stop lying that no way you are

470
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Oh

471
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:49,800
I'm still having audio issues, so I'm just chilling this one. Hi, everyone. It's going on. No, no, no, me most will stay away from me

472
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
You guys

473
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:13,960
Rodney, I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like this. This is sorry. That's suspicious. I'm getting chased by mercy halfway across the canteen

474
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Can I do this one?

475
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Is it? Hmm?

476
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Are you alone?

477
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,280
Yeah, okay. Okay. Come here. Come on the hallway

478
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Oh

479
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,880
What are we what are we doing we need to do a double

480
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
What's going on in here

481
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,200
Guys, I think mimosa is too tiny. All of us. She's imposter, but she's

482
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,640
I don't want to be with an imposter

483
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
I

484
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
I don't want to be with an imposter

485
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,640
That is gotta you do a double. Yes

486
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
I'm thinking

487
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,280
Thinking Mimi and Brian. Yeah

488
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Hi

489
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
This is what this looks like. Hi

490
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Wait

491
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Chibi

492
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I'm not the imposter

493
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,280
You are the imposter in the line engine output. What does that mean? Oh, it's up here

494
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Bye

495
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Hello, hello

496
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,160
I gotta go to the he's going down into I believe medby

497
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,400
He's out of medby incredibly quickly timing on chibi coming out of medby almost as if uninterested in any casmos

498
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Hold on

499
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,560
We don't

500
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,040
Only rain. I found rain dead in the back of electrical. Nobody was nearby

501
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,760
But I have a feeling it might be rea and azura because they like to sit with each other

502
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,960
I saw mimosa and rea together. No, I saw. Yeah, isn't that suspicious?

503
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
I thought rea was here

504
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:12,200
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean they couldn't have vented from electrical to security rea and mersey are very

505
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,040
unlikely of had to do the time in order to do electrical unless mersey vented from below

506
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,440
But I actually wait, did I see you come on camera? I don't think that would make any sense. I think it's azura. I'm sorry, azura

507
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Can you corroborate

508
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,960
Yeah, I need azura being fucking sus. I'm going for azura. Why are you sucking her toes, bro?

509
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
I didn't want you

510
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,200
It's because you know what you're talking about because you know what your tell is now, huh, strawnee?

511
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,160
So you're you're gonna keep quiet. I'm saying was strawnee because I I stuck with her in almost half

512
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Thanks

513
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,600
You did that I'll stay on count. Oh, mersey's gonna fucking bowl with me

514
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,760
Don't press mersey either. She's fucking working on me. I'm talking most of said she was the imposter and so I was like bye

515
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Okay

516
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
I'm so scared

517
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,560
Mosta is following Amy so whatever happens in that room. We're mostly in Amy or confer

518
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,440
No, ma'am. No, ma'am. It's I me. It's I me. It's I me. It's I me. It's I me

519
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,120
It's I me. She was sitting she pulled oxygen

520
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
She was just fucking

521
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,440
It was I me

522
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,400
When the oxygen is going down and we're all about to die. No, ma'am. No, motherfucking ma'am. No, ma'am. No, ma'am. No, ma'am

523
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Bye

524
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Get deleted. Bye

525
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,080
Why did you run so slowly to oxygen?

526
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And you put in the code

527
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,320
I mean, you know

528
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,840
It doesn't take five seconds to type in a code

529
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,000
Okay, well, I guess we'll see I guess we'll see okay

530
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,840
Mosta if it's if it's not her

531
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
You've been screaming that you were the

532
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Yeah, I could have murdered her

533
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,200
Yeah, well, maybe she wanted an alibi. Why are you defending the person that's trying to kill you?

534
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,520
Maybe you guys are both the the fucking imposters. I don't trust either one of you now

535
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,160
Well, she's acting like a sassy baka so she'll be

536
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
I'm sorry, I'm skipping

537
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,480
You're gonna get deep freeze then space. Goodbye. Well, it wouldn't be the first and it's not gonna be the last

538
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,400
I don't know. I'm gonna choose the one that I cast your vote. I cast your vote. Wait, who should I choose?

539
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
The most are I me

540
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Come on, mercy

541
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,120
I meet I meet I meet. All right. Goodbye

542
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Goodbye

Everybody's just screaming we gotta we gotta give each other

546
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
You gotta let the acute

547
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Give her a boys

548
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,960
Yeah, Ray's been perfect the entire time. I bet she's gonna be imposter next round, but that's fine

549
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,760
All right, that's a little bit of karma. It's not black

550
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,280
It's okay. I'm just a very good lawyer. I'm not in a good way

551
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
I'm gonna make you sweaty more

552
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Yo

553
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,080
I'm tired of sweating. Mommy memos is coming for you

554
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
Oh

555
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,440
Wait, I don't know where the fuck I'm going. There we go this way

556
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
The fight the

557
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
Ivy

558
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,160
Okay, okay, let her say her piece. Look, I like I found my freaking butt. I mean you were right next. I just saw you

559
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,120
No, I think it's rain

560
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
I think it's rain this time her voice is quivering

561
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,640
I think it's rain because when I was watching it, it was like rain satter. I can't even say anything

562
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,400
I swear it's rain. Her voice is so different. It's a pitch lower

563
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,480
I'm I'm skipping my vote. I'm I can't I'm upstanding. I'm upstanding

564
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,440
I literally walked away not knowing where I was going

565
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,760
Hey, listen, oh hi Mia. Listen, if the imposter wins, you guys are gonna lose. Okay. All right. That's all I have to say

566
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,560
All right, that was so quick. I couldn't get any information that round was insane

567
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
I

568
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,080
No, I was I was at wait shit. Where's where's the

569
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,440
OT didn't know where she was going just like me. I heard her walk away and I was laughing about it. Yeah. Oh too

570
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
Oh

571
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:48,280
Oh, oh, that's how I do it. I should honestly memorize this for next time when I'm imposter

572
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
Oh

573
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:05,480
Communications, I don't know where I'm going this one, right? Oh right here

574
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,400
Honestly when I'm doing chores when I'm not streaming guys

575
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,840
It's it's really like boring

576
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
It's like I'm doing my chores

577
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,440
What?

578
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm doing my chores and then

579
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,080
Yeah, hold on. I'm still I'm still doing this thing

580
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh, okay. Uh, I think mercy is fine

581
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,760
Where's the thing wait, where's the thing? I know it. Oh, well, we need we need oxygen

582
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
Let's go guys. I'm trying to run to it

583
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,200
I'm guarding you. I am I'm guarding you. I'm guarding you. Don't do it mercy

584
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,680
Okay, I did it. I'm proud of you. Good job. We're good

585
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Pop, you did it. You did it

586
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,760
Oh, shoot. Where's my other thing? I don't know if I trust mercy. I don't know if I trust mercy. Follow me. I'm going to admin

587
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
Hi, hi

588
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
Oh my gosh, first try

589
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Yeah

590
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,240
I fucking knew it. I fucking knew it. I told you your voice

591
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
I told you you're

592
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Wait

593
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Rain does she have a brain

594
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Oh great

595
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,360
No, it's not rain. It's you. It's you rain. She's so sus

596
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,880
It's rain

597
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:07,160
I don't know where strongy was strongy. Uh, I saw her like a long time ago, but mercy was in the hallway

598
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,640
Why is she voting already? I'm so sus. I had walked all the way from weapons

599
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,080
Through cafeteria and then found her body there. Where rea rea. Where did you come from?

600
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,960
I went from so I I went in the circle. I went from admin to down and then through I think it's

601
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,000
Hold on. So you were the last one to see mercy

602
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Yeah, I was I think actually

603
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,800
That is not helping. I'm voting rain because she's a sure yes. Oh my god, rain

604
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
Voting rain

605
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Listen, I'm pretty sure I think that was so funny. Okay. I did

606
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,960
I was sitting there, but it's so innocent. She shouldn't have met the

607
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,040
No, poor rea. She has she has no thoughts

608
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Yeah, I was literally too innocent

609
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,080
Well, I wasn't really

610
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,000
With your head, I thought it was I mean, I think it might be

611
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,640
I don't think it's I don't know anyone that I know it's I mean is one of them

612
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:20,440
Yes, I freaking know it. I we had every chance to kill me. We were alone so many times. No, no, I think she's in this track

613
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I watched her do the oxygen

614
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Maybe maybe maybe

615
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Rain could not lie

616
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,760
I think she's grooming her. I think it's a zura and rain

617
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
It's horrible

618
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,360
I did I did see you walk past me, but you could have moved back around you might have been waiting for your moment

619
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,760
That's impossible because I literally ran past

620
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,560
No, it's not a zura. I don't think it's I think it's actually I me and rain. Listen, I know it

621
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,400
I actually discussed the whole right by me and rea. Oh, shit

622
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,080
It doesn't matter where you get out of here. Get out of here

623
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,320
You cheating conniving whore

624
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,360
That is so funny. I don't think I'll catch I'll catch on

625
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,760
Okay, but who's gonna be? I'm trying to help her. I mean, I mean, I mean, what's going on?

626
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,440
Uh, if they kill one of us, that means we lose so we confess you're a sin

627
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:33,080
Or we can hit the table oxygen depleted. It's a zura. It's a zura. It's a zura. I mean

628
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,880
Kill them kill them and let them know who you are

629
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
Just kill more people

630
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
I

631
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,480
My god

632
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,560
You were back stabbed I know

633
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,680
Why was rain so hard voting for her old

634
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,120
Dude, I was trying to help her so you guys wouldn't think it was her. No, I think the grooming is messy with my mind

635
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,600
Rea, please don't get groomed. Oh my goodness. I I burped. I'm so sorry

636
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,200
In my mouth

637
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,960
Rea you were with a zone

638
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,480
God rea is actually dumb

639
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,760
Where are you?

640
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Miss girl

641
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
Masterclass rain strat

642
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,000
These don't let me be be teamed with rain because she'll backstab me

643
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,600
That was so funny

644
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,080
Anyways, I called it. I was like your voice is

645
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,560
Is it it was a good strat? It was a good strat

646
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
My god, mommy

647
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I clothed you so fast

648
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:42,120
Oh, my god, I don't see it. It's your audio issues. Oh, okay. Oh, I'm sorry. I clothed you so fast

649
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,120
I know you don't need to be a little freaky pooh

650
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,840
Oh, you don't need to be a star or anything

651
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,680
Uh, this is how I cut catch senpai's in a wave

652
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,560
I have never felt so betrayed in my entire life

653
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,880
That was backstab me

654
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,880
Don't look at me anymore

655
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,200
Backstab is central

656
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,920
You're evil. I mean thanks for letting me win lunch. She needed a little help that round

657
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,080
We would you threw me onto the bus

658
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
Don't lie you like it you would never lie

659
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:30,040
You would lie behind me. I know you like being teased too little. You little I'm gonna smack your ass

660
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,720
Indulge rea. I mean, I'm sorry. I only loves being bullied and teased guys. She loves it

661
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
You see, you know

662
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,760
Gaslet is abuse

663
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,200
Hello, mommy

664
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,160
Mommy

665
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,080
I guess she's not gonna be able to listen to her

666
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,840
Oh, well, you don't need audio to play this game

667
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:14,360
Someone echoing someone echoing. Who is echoing? I would need it one's game is echoing. Oh, it's my job. What's my time? Oh, no, no

668
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,960
Reactor

669
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,480
Then admin later

670
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,400
I hate this one

671
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,480
That one was kind of hard senpai

672
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,480
I

673
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,360
Do do do do

674
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,280
Now it's kind of hard. Her audio is busted. She has to fix her audio

675
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,200
Hmm. I'm gonna download. Hi, mercy. Hi. I'm downloading too. What the hell same tasks?

676
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,480
Ah, fuck. My god, we're twinning

677
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
Ah, fuck. Okay, we gotta fix that

678
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,360
Hey, where the fuck did she go?

679
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,880
Did she vent

680
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Oh

681
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,680
Wait, the entire room is dead help help

682
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,880
Ah, everyone's dead

683
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
No, the oxygen

684
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,040
It's freaking mercy

685
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,480
Listen

686
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,560
Listen, she was standing right there. I walk into the card room or whatever

687
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,280
Then I am used dead body and then mercy then reports. Why are we just standing? Yeah, that's kind of sus

688
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,280
I was doing I was doing the um, I was doing the downloads and I wouldn't let me go. Oh my god

689
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,800
I go fucking here. Hey, you got freaking nervous. She saw me. I was doing the download. So it was a self-report

690
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,760
No, the task is for doing a body

691
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,200
It's a self-report. I was doing the task. I didn't notice until I saw the body since started screaming

692
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:20,360
How do you not notice the body did a task before reporting a body on purpose? Yes or no?

693
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,240
I think it's mercy. It's the download thing. Well, you can vote for me if you want

694
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:30,520
But it's gonna say non faster than I'm gonna tell you told you so and then you know, I'm voting for you. I'm sorry mercy

695
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:36,280
Anyways, you're acting weird. If you vote for me if you want, that sounds very suspicious. Oh, you can vote for me

696
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. I'll prove you right. This is off topic

697
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:47,560
When that oxygen thing comes on, what do you did I look at the wrong part of the map for the oxygen?

698
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,560
Because I was trying to turn it back on

699
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:56,200
You can't tell where the right side of that. What's going on? Hey mercy, if it's not you, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry

700
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,200
Yeah, well, you should be

701
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:04,520
Why would she not report? Why would you do that for me? Why did I randomly get a vote? Because I'm doing oxygen

702
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,520
And you're saying what the fuck?

703
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Oh, she wasn't a fuck.

704
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,520
Why did she just say that?

705
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Funny ever again.

706
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,520
I can remember. I don't know why any of you ever trust Strony. I don't understand anything about her.

707
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,520
I don't understand anything about her.

708
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
I don't understand anything about her.

709
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,520
I'm not trying to do the oxygen.

710
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,520
I was just trying to do the oxygen.

711
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,520
I was trying to do the oxygen.

712
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,520
I was trying to put the oxygen, but no, I'm still serious.

713
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,520
I'm still serious.

714
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,520
Okay, listen.

715
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,520
I was trying to do the oxygen.

716
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,520
I was trying to do the oxygen.

717
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,520
Why would you do the oxygen? I sabotaged it.

718
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,520
I'm perfect.

719
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:44,520
Because I didn't know what to have an alibi to say that I'm top left when the fuck is used.

720
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,520
I don't care.

721
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,520
I'm in alcohol.

722
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,520
Right before I get kicked off, I will choose who the imposter is.

723
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,520
Okay, go for it.

724
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,520
Literally, I was looking at the map and it was flashing.

725
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,520
I'm like, where the F am I supposed to go?

726
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,520
Honestly, I walked in and I was like,

727
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,520
Me and Rhea were just swiping our cards, having a jolly good time.

728
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,520
I was literally like, one, three, two, one.

729
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Literally, and they doubled us.

730
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,520
I was literally just standing there.

731
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,520
I was standing there because I literally was stuck at the Delos.

732
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,520
There was so much shock.

733
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Bro, allegedly the horror.

734
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,520
They're like, oh, we must be safe.

735
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,520
I trust a word.

736
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,520
Never trust Ronnie.

737
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,520
Never trust Ronnie.

738
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,520
Oh, Mercy, you're scaring me.

739
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,520
Mercy, you're scaring me.

740
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,520
Mercy, you're scaring me.

741
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,520
Mercy!

742
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,520
I am.

743
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,520
No!

744
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
Momosa, Momosa, please!

745
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,520
Mercy is hunting me down.

746
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,520
Leave her alone!

747
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
Leave Brittany alone!

748
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,520
Laughing evilly and she's chasing me with a knife in her hand.

749
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,520
One knife!

750
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,520
Leave Brittany alone!

751
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,520
Oh wait, I'm here.

752
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,520
Why did y'all run there so late?

753
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,520
How the fuck did I do this one?

754
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,520
No, I was doing one task and I saw everyone go here.

755
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,520
I just pressed it twice.

756
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,520
It's not rare because she and I were the only ones.

757
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,520
Leave me alone.

758
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,520
I dropped Quarters in the cafeteria then.

759
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,520
Yeah, I was here first.

760
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,520
Nobody stabbing the back.

761
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,520
I'm very focused.

762
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,520
I protect.

763
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,520
Can I pet that dog?

764
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,520
No, they're doing the task.

765
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,520
I'm petting the dog.

766
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
Inazera.

767
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,520
We're gonna go fix this oxygen.

768
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,520
Mercy.

769
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,520
Mercy, hello!

770
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Hello!

771
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,520
Hello! How are you?

772
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,520
Good! How are you?

773
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,520
I'm good.

774
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,520
I'm lost.

775
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,520
Where are you going?

776
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,520
Are you the imposter?

777
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,520
Whoa!

778
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,520
It means you never play.

779
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,520
Ivy's just not allowed to play.

780
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,520
She's not allowed to play.

781
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
She was chilling and shielding.

782
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,520
I saw me doing the reactor shit.

783
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,520
I don't know how this thing works.

784
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,520
I was a navigation.

785
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,520
Good.

786
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,520
I was doing wiring in front of Azure.

787
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,520
She was walking in the halls.

788
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,520
She was laughing easily chasing me down a hallway.

789
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
I ran into the open arms of Namosa.

790
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,520
She was really fun.

791
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,520
It's really funny.

792
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,520
Who were you with?

793
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,520
I was with Mercy.

794
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,520
Rain and Mercy.

795
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,520
Where was Raya?

796
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,520
Where was Raya at?

797
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,520
I was doing wiring.

798
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,520
I was also at the Xeroa point.

799
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,520
Xeroa, who are you accusing?

800
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,520
Speak your truth.

801
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,520
I didn't accuse anyone.

802
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,520
I have no clue what's going on.

803
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,520
Wait, that's so suspicious.

804
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Right.

805
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,520
I'm going to say this.

806
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,520
Azure took a second to do any type of task.

807
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,520
She followed me from cafeteria

808
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,520
down to storage

809
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,520
and then parted ways out.

810
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,520
I don't believe you.

811
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,520
I was so excited about fixing my audio.

812
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,520
I was so happy.

813
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,520
That's also true and that's very on par for you.

814
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,520
I will say.

815
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,520
That is her thinking that loud.

816
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,520
I don't know about this.

817
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,520
Where was the dead body?

818
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
I just saw it.

819
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,520
Where's the location of the rain and Mercy?

820
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,520
Where's the shield?

821
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,520
I didn't see anyone nearby but the closest

822
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,520
was Rainn and Mercy.

823
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,520
They were by 02.

824
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,520
Where was I?

825
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,520
I'm not trying to figure out who the imposter is.

826
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,520
When I am the imposter

827
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
Oh no it's not me.

828
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
Wait.

829
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,520
She isn't talking to me this time.

830
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,520
He is not talking that much.

831
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,520
Just shove up your something.

832
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:15,520
No, I don't I think it's Marcy. I don't she's being sassy. I love

833
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
How about you all staying from existing?

834
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:26,360
My only my only inclination and my only inclination is my mom. Is that your cat's food dish? Yes

835
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:34,920
My only inclination is mimosa self-report is my only inclination and then my god, don't tell them

836
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,620
Abstain rain abstained looking at you will shifty eyes. Don't touch me

837
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:57,120
I don't know to believe either anyways who's most anyways, it's just fun

838
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,080
No, I don't I want to stay away from Marcy. Okay?

839
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,520
We're good

840
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,620
Wait, how'd I do this? Oh, I got it right

841
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,520
Oh

842
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:04,440
Azura it's Azura, dude, I think it's Azura. I saw her walking into electrical. Yeah

843
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,520
Electrical and found a body what the fuck?

844
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,780
Me and stronti are good. I was hanging out stronti looking at cameras

845
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,400
Being creepy I'm gonna vote for Marcy

846
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,000
Marcy who were you with or who did you see at any point in the map? I

847
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,160
Passed by mimosa. Oh

848
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,160
When you killed her no

849
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,480
It's rain, it's rain. It's really rain

850
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,120
But why where's the reasoning Azura

851
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:13,760
All right, all right, stronti stay with me stronti stronti stronti

852
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,000
I'm the last task. I don't know who the fuck is missing out on tasks, but we're literally

853
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,440
Fucking Marcy

854
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:49,720
You have to listen to us

855
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,640
Because her and Marcy almost doubled me and stronti

856
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:08,560
You guys were gonna double you guys were lining yourselves up to stab me in my butthole

857
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,520
Marcy it's Marcy it's Marcy stay away from the end I can't call it

858
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,640
She's a pocket pillow

01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,200
Get that yandere off this ship right now. She's creeping me out

860

Chasing the and stronti when I actually have the chance to actually like pay attention

01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:57,760
Don't trust I be okay. Well, we'll just vote her off. She was so adamant

897
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,600
The same tears as before

Okay, okay, I fucking knew it. Okay, I'm gonna be over here

It's everything fixed

905
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,480
No, why is it so quiet

906
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,640
I

907
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,800
Got one more

01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,960
Everything's too quiet too quiet

909
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,560
I finished my tasks

910
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:49,080
Where is everyone I'm terrified

911
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,080
Wait, where is everyone?

912
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,800

914
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,920
Med Bay I said I found her in Med Bay. I finished my task and then I was like where the fuck is everyone?

915
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,640
It's Tony. It's Tony. Hey, why is it fucking me?

916
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:25,200
Because I was in wiring admin with Azure. Yeah. Yeah, it's Tony. Why because

917
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,560
Accusations

918
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,840
No

919
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,120
It's Marysie self report and I will tell you

920
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,560
Oh

921
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,440
Wait, no, it's Marysie. No, it's

922
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,760
It's Azra

923
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,080
I swear

924
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,400
Rae, Rae

925
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,440
Listen listen to Azra's voice her voice is slightly higher pitch the new usual

926
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:49,800
What do you mean? No, no, no, no, she's trying to gaslight you. I'm not gaslighting you

927
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:55,120
I we've hung out the entire time. No, we've hung out the entire time. It's Marysie

928
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,440
I can't believe it

929
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,440
I can't believe it

930
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,200
It's always the cute one

931
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,840
Vented and killed me in Med Bay

932
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,960
I was like, oh shit

933
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,440
Marysie

934
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,680
But you instantly went for me when I

935
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,440
It's because you said it was mercy

936
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,760
When I get imposter you're dying first. I'm not even kidding

937
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,480
You're so funny

938
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,280
Marysie, I thought I thought she said it was Marysie and I knew Marysie was innocent

939
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,920
I thought Marysie was innocent because what Marysie said

940
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Everyone's always suspects me

941
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,360
Everyone just suspects me it's unfair

942
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,680
It's unfair that everyone thinks it's me

943
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,160
I

944
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:55,280
See are you gonna get me? What are you doing? I'm just doing my tasks Marysie

945
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,440
I

946
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,200
Did you I witnessed that

947
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,440
I should have known

948
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,800
Give me a second

949
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:21,440
I'm telling them I got kicked out

950
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:40,080
Anyways, it was really fun guys it was super fun to just you know kill everyone

951
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:49,840
I just had to chase I'm so glad that I was able to chase she be down and went

01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,680
And getting right yeah

953
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,840
Honestly, I just wanted to creep people out because it's fun

954
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,800
I I've never gotten imposter this many times, you know

955
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:36,520
I've never gotten imposter this many times so I was like

956
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,440
Honestly creeping people out it's just fun just fun

957
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:53,160
Okay, okay, give me a second. I'm gonna get back in ten pies

958
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,520
I'm gonna have to enter the code

959
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,520
It's not letting me in

960
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,560
I

961
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,680
Did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in again, I mean I might have to

962
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,840
Oh, there we go we got in

963
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,080
We got it

964
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,440
In the lobby

965
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,280
I fucking love when there's four people

966
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,920
When there's two of us together, I love going three to one

967
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:09,440
Satisfying so satisfying in like execute the plan with a woman

968
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,720
Anyways, my next goal is to follow someone just for fun

969
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,760
Just to wait the movie. Why do you sound so far away?

970
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,280
Oh

971
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,760
I forgot I forgot she has like an actual place to live and doesn't work in our basement like me

972
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:34,080
Right next to her guess that's cool. I want food right next to me. Honestly, Ray. I was too good

973
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,000
I like believed her. I believed her innocent

974
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,640
She's such a good liar believe you're capable of anything

975
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:55,200
You didn't change your tone of voice at all when lying yo, why is my peeing dancing like that?

976
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,040
Never trust Rhea, I can't tell she's one of a few people I can't tell

977
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,280
My mouth is dry, I'm sorry

978
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,880
I just noticed your voice

979
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,760
Notice your voice is so beautiful. I

980
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,760
Believed her to the end as well dead ass. I believe ran to the end

981
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,560
I can never tell

982
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,200
Until by the anger in my voice when I get accused wrongly

983
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,240
Every time you you you don't let someone finish

984
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,320
It feels like you're being defensive and not letting the person speak. So you know cuz you

985
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:54,160
Yeah, you gotta let me you gotta give me the bill. Yeah, let me explain the reason because you're

986
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,600
You gotta let me explain why and then you have a okay why I'm wrong

987
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:10,040
Because the only reason I got that last game is because you voted so quickly

988
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,600
I wanted to I thought strong you with suspicious anyways, it just feels good

989
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:25,720
Yeah, the Scottish right the Scottish one suspicious. I see how it is

990
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,540
That's it. You're getting set as the alveolar members officially

991
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,360
suspended for 48 days no pain

992
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,920
40 days for any way

993
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:47,700
You're really good. Yeah, so I'll say one thing the girls have never seen me

994
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,720
Any other type of motion other than like happy and proud of their work

995
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:55,920
So playing among us when I'm screaming down the make being like it's fucking

996
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,480
It's probably quite a surprise

997
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,560
I want to see a Zara and rea or scrawny and rea team up. That's what I want to say

998
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,400
scrawny and rea will probably

999
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,040
The statistics of a Zara being imposter very high. No, just keep that in mind by the way, it's my improbability statistics

1000
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,720
They're all fun to mess with I'm eating bold

1001
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,720
I

1002
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Because he says the

1003
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,680
I'm gonna be wait, wait, wait, wait, who said that the most out you're on my hit list

1004
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,120
Wait, no, I'm supposed to be over here

1005
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,720
I

1006
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,000
Trust nobody everybody says I don't trust nobody

1007
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,440
What what we just did

1008
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,680
Okay

1009
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,720
I

1010
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:56,080
Can't find where I'm going. I'm almost done my task

1011
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Wait

1012
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,120
There was the other body. Oh my god

1013
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,120
Oh my god

1014
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,880
Where was everyone I was about to report

1015
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,520
Wait, wait, where's my where's my thing?

1016
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:22,720
I saw scrawny I passed by those two. I was an electrical there was a body there

1017
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,080
Um well first of all

1018
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,480
Secondly, I was shooting asteroids and I walked out and there's a body at oxygen and it was mimosa

1019
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:44,960
By is anyone being a navigation or two or weapons yes or no, no, I was in cafeteria

1020
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:51,960
I was about to do electrical. It was cafeteria. I know it's scrawny. I just know it's scrawny. I just know it's scrawny

1021
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,600
Are you fucking wait hold on a minute?

1022
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:02,080
Hold on a minute. I say who's been near weapons oh to navigation because you have reported the body and where oh to

1023
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:07,380
And you automatically go it's scrawny. Sorry. I know you love playing these mind games be like it's scrawny

1024
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,380
It's scrawny. Forget it. Fuck

1025
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,680
It's fucking she be

1026
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:20,740
Because I'm nice and calm and she's freaking out

1027
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:28,340
Cuz you're picking on me when you were self-reported the body when you're the only person who's been witnessing with an auto navigation

1028
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,840
Yeah, it could be both of them body must have been there

1029
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,400
report because no one else has been there

1030
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,360
I mean, who are you with again?

1031
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,040
And

1032
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,320
Yeah, I was with Amy because we were hanging out. Oh, yes, he was right his body

1033
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:59,080
Because she was alive and then when she walked off and then that's and then I was singing a song

1034
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,840
The round goes fast is scrawny cuz Johnny kills fast

1035
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,840
Thank you

1036
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,800
I

1037
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,360
Okay, goodbye

1038
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,360
The moment she starts getting defensive and loud

1039
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,480
She

1040
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:58,720
You were the only person in that area because I killed her long ago in that area. No, that's what I mean

1041
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:03,080
I'm like, I had to have happened long ago. I can't believe mommy would do this

1042
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,360
The next time I'll kill her first you betrayed me

1043
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,400
Excuse me, which you guys could see all the gesturing that I'm doing right now

1044
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,160
Look at our cute little rival queen of gas

01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,440
Press the button. Thank you

1046
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,560
It's like

01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,560
I want to feel like

1048
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,360
I crave blood and death

1049
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,720
I'm defending myself against that she be

1050
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,160
I'm gonna get fucking

1051
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,320
Don't be angry

1052

01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,800
Your girlfriend smells like trash

01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,800
They're so naughty

1240
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:35,800
What the fuck? It's not me. It's not me. She fucking void me. So I thought she was so

1241
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,800
She's literally not me

1242
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:39,800
It's so great

1243
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,800
Anyways, who am I haunting?

1244
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,800
It's the Jots

1245
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,800
Azra, you killed me

1246
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,800
Azra

1247
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:53,800
Enough on me because we can't even believe for a second that I might be a wee bit nice in this video

1248
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,800
Cookies

1249
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,800
Chicken nuggets

1250
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,800
Oh

1251
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,800
I'm so nervous

1252
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,800
What's happening? What's happening?

1253
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:07,800
Yeah, like, couldn't shut the app your arse. Honestly

1254
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,800
That was good

1255
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,800
That was good. I liked that

1256
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,800
I'm gonna come back

1257
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,800
The most so

1258
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:17,800
I wouldn't have written a poll that gave

1259
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,800
I'm sorry I couldn't

1260
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,800
I couldn't focus. I just kept hearing

1261
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:23,800
I just kept hearing where she's ghost

1262
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:25,800
I don't hear it too

1263
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,800
I don't hear it too

1264
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,800
I'm sorry

1265
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:31,800
I'm sorry

1266
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,800
I'm sorry

1267
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,800
I'm saying because I knew if I voted

1268
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,800
The most so

1269
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:41,800
You came out swinging against me with absolutely nothing to your name

1270
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:43,800
Of course I thought you were sauce

1271
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:47,800
You did the same thing to me when we both were innocent

1272
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,800
Oh my gosh

1273
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,800
She just accuses

1274
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,800
It doesn't listen people out

1275
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,800
It doesn't listen to people

1276
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:57,800
I tried to let everyone have a fucking go at me

1277
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,800
Wait, hold on

1278
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,800
I was about to just

1279
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,800
Wait, wait, listen

1280
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,800
I was about to like say food

1281
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,800
I was like y'all's a chicken nuggets

1282
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:09,800
A reefling has said

1283
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,800
A reefling has said

1284
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,800
It's not about Stormy being nice or not

1285
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:15,800
It's about me being dangerous

1286
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,800
Which has been proven in previous rounds

1287
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,800
So none of you believe me

1288
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,800
When I'm freaking a crewmate

1289
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,800
Yeah, it's true

1290
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,800
Every time we start

1291
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,800
You always say that it's probably always going to be someone

1292
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,800
Or you say that we're always

1293
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,800
Because I'm trying to figure out who it is

1294
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,800
I'm like trying to figure out

1295
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:35,800
I'm trying to be like

1296
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,800
Okay, thank you for voting

1297
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,800
Unfortunately, we're misfired

1298
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,800
We missed

1299
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,800
Alright, last game, make it count

1300
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,800
Hope Strawny's an imposter

1301
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,800
Oh, I'm an imposter, right?

1302
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,800
I'm going for Mercy first

1303
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,800
Why are you going for me first?

1304
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,800
Cause I'm an imposter

1305
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,800
Nooooo

1306
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,800
Sorry, Mercy, I'll guard you

1307
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,800
It'll be so funny if like

1308
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,800
It is Strawny and she comes to kill Mercy

1309
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:07,800
I can't fucking do this

1310
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:09,800
I'm really focused on this card read

1311
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:11,800
Can you guys go do that?

1312
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,800
Okay, I got it

1313
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,800
How do I get there?

1314
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,800
Oh shit, I went the wrong way

1315
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,800
Oh, is it done?

1316
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,800
It's me, I killed Mercy

1317
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:37,800
Well, no, it's not, I was actually just with Strawny

1318
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:39,800
Oh, so now you don't want to accuse me

1319
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:41,800
Cause I saw you talking

1320
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,800
You were talking to the wall

1321
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,800
Talking to your chat and it was quite cute

1322
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,800
So I was just staring at you

1323
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,800
So it wasn't you

1324
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,800
Uh, it's okay

1325
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,800
I wanted to do my tasks

1326
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,800
Is that the two of you?

1327
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,800
I mean

1328
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,800
I mean

1329
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:01,800
I got killed by Raine

1330
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,800
They're not gonna believe you

1331
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,800
They're not gonna believe you

1332
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,800
No, they're not gonna believe you

1333
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,800
It happened so fast, I wasn't paying attention

1334
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,800
They're not gonna believe you

1335
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:13,800
Hold on

1336
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,800
Dude

1337
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:17,800
Yeah, I'm really worried

1338
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:19,800
Dude, what the fuck

1339
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,800
Tear work is crazy

1340
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:23,800
No

1341
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:25,800
Hold on

1342
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,800
Are they gonna get it?

1343
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,800
Are they gonna get Raine on the first try?

1344
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,800
Wait, what's the dealio?

1345
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,800
So Mamosa finds the body where?

1346
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,800
Outside of reactor

1347
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,800
It was two of them

1348
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,800
Sade of reactor

1349
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,800
Raine, you're vouching for Ria and Mamosa

1350
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:43,800
Raine, sorry

1351
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,800
I was vouching for Ria and Mamosa

1352
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,800
Wait, but I'm not vouching for Raine

1353
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,800
I'm not vouching for Raine cause I didn't see

1354
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,800
I don't know

1355
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,800
I was just swiping a card

1356
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:55,800
Yeah, to be honest

1357
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,800
I told you guys to go worry about it

1358
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:59,800
You can tell

1359
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:01,800
Yeah, it's me, but me

1360
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:03,800
Okay, it's Raine

1361
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,800
Cause she's being too quiet

1362
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:07,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1363
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,800
Raine's being too quiet

1364
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,800
Thanks for voting me

1365
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,800
Well, it's very kind of you to think about me

1366
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,800
The audience is obviously

1367
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,800
Strony

1368
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:19,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1369
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,800
Throw Strony into easy peasy

1370
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:23,800
Lemon squeeze

1371
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:25,800
If I die, Strony killed me

1372
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:27,800
Ria!

1373
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:29,800
Ria!

1374
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,800
She's a little bastard

1375
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,800
I'm so proud of her

1376
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,800
She's using my strat

1377
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,800
I can't believe you anyways

1378
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,800
Ria!

1379
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,800
You monster!

1380
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,800
You innocent little baby

1381
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,800
Goo Goo Gaga

1382
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,800
Ria!

1383
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:49,800
Yeah, it's not me and Strony

1384
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:51,800
We're busy

1385
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:53,800
What's going on guys?

1386
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,800
I'm on my fifth try

1387
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,800
Come on

1388
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:59,800
She's such a good liar

1389
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:01,800
She's like

1390
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:03,800
It's between Amy and Mamosa

1391
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,800
It's between Amy and Mamosa

1392
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:07,800
Yeah, cause me and me and

1393
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:09,800
Strony were hanging out on medbay

1394
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:11,800
I believe Ria's claim on the fifth card

1395
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,800
Swipe no offense

1396
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,800
I believe you are

1397
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:17,800
Mamosa, say your piece

1398
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:19,800
Her voice does not change tones

1399
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,800
Goodbye

1400
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:23,800
I'm so cute

1401
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,800
She's so cute

1402
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,800
They don't even suspect her

1403
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,800
I don't know who to vote for

1404
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:31,800
I know, she has to

1405
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,800
It's Mamosa then

1406
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,800
It's Mamosa then

1407
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:37,800
Oh my god

1408
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:39,800
Yeah, we were touching her on the medbay

1409
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:41,800
Is she gonna get away with it?

1410
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,800
She might get away with this by herself

1411
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:45,800
She's all

1412
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,800
What?

1413
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,800
Mamosa, why?

1414
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,800
Mamosa, why?

1415
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:53,800
Why?

1416
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:55,800
Mamosa, she couldn't kill me at any time

1417
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,800
Mamosa, she couldn't kill me at any time

1418
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,800
I know, I know

1419
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,800
Goo Goo Gaga

1420
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,800
Baby Ria

1421
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:05,800
Confess your sins

1422
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:07,800
Confess your sins

1423
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,800
Yes

1424
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:11,800
It's

1425
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:13,800
Oh

1426
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,800
We're haunting you

1427
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,800
Murderer

1428
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:19,800
Murderer

1429
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,800
Ria

1430
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:23,800
Ria

1431
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:27,800
Ria

1432
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,800
Confess your sins

1433
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,800
Sin

1434
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,800
Sin

1435
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:37,800
Sin

1436
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,800
Sin

1437
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:41,800
Sin

1438
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:43,800
Goo Goo Gaga

1439
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:45,800
Baby

1440
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:47,800
We love you Ria, you can do this love

1441
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,800
Don't listen to me

1442
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,800
No, don't listen to your partner

1443
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:53,800
Someone left their baby

1444
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,800
Yeah, it was Azra

1445
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,800
My baby

1446
01:58:57,800 --> 01:58:59,800
Notice the gyoza

1447
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,800
They killed a mother with a baby

1448
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:07,800
Did somebody leave?

1449
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,800
She pulled a clutch that's actually crazy

1450
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:11,800
I'm so proud of her, oh my god

1451
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,800
Wait, what happened?

1452
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:15,800
You guys don't clear the sabotage

1453
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:17,800
No one ever clears the sabotage

1454
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:19,800
What?

1455
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,800
Oh, it's the lights

1456
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:23,800
Yeah, it's the lights

1457
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,800
So if you don't fix it

1458
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,800
No, not the lights

1459
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,800
The lights doesn't

1460
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,800
Yeah, I said that we won

1461
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:33,800
Okay

1462
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,800
Oh, crewmates won?

1463
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:37,800
I see crewmates

1464
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:39,800
Oh, did you finish all your tasks?

1465
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:41,800
Nice

1466
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:43,800
Nice

1467
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:45,800
Are we satisfied?

1468
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:47,800
I'm happy

1469
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,800
I'm happy

1470
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:51,800
I want one more, I'm not satisfied

1471
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,800
One more

1472
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,800
One more

1473
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:57,800
One more

1474
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:59,800
One more

1475
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:01,800
Wait, where's Ria?

1476
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:03,800
Where's Ria to cross?

1477
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,800
Oh, Ria called Kate, hold on

1478
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,800
Ria called Kate, give her a second

1479
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,800
There she is

1480
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:11,800
I'm so proud of you

1481
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,800
Welcome back

1482
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,800
To go back

1483
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:17,800
My vaude

1484
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:19,800
I'm so proud of her

1485
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:21,800
I am

1486
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:23,800
We didn't even clear the task

1487
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,800
I was so close to

1488
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:27,800
I was so close

1489
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,800
She's such an evil being

1490
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:31,800
I don't know who the other imposter was

1491
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:33,800
Who's the other imposter?

1492
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:35,800
Rain and Ria

1493
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:37,800
Oh, it was Rain

1494
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,800
I had a feeling it was

1495
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:41,800
Med Bay

1496
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,800
Why guard me in Med Bay?

1497
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:49,800
I swear I will haunt you

1498
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:51,800
and say words

1499
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,800
What's the emergency?

1500
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:55,800
I covered emergency

1501
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:57,800
Oh, okay, okay

1502
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,800
Okay, let's go

1503
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:01,800
I covered emergency, it's not you

1504
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,800
No, the lights, hold on

1505
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:05,800
Oh, it's the wrong way

1506
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,800
I went the wrong way

1507
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,800
Wait, where is everyone?

1508
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,800
I saw Azra

1509
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,800
I saw Azra

1510
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,800
I saw Azra

1511
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:17,800
No, no, it was

1512
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:19,800
It was Azra

1513
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,800
Someone got disconnected

1514
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:23,800
and that's why the game ended

1515
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:25,800
That's why

1516
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,800
I was with Ria and Ria

1517
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,800
and Electric

1518
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:31,800
We have an alibi

1519
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:33,800
It was Azra

1520
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:35,800
I saw Azra

1521
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:37,800
I saw Azra

1522
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,800
It was Azra

1523
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,800
I saw her killer

1524
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,800
We were together

1525
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:45,800
You both were together in Med Bay

1526
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:47,800
You both were together in Med Bay

1527
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:49,800
and I walked into Med Bay

1528
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:51,800
and then we walked

1529
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:53,800
You both were together

1530
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,800
We both saw you

1531
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:57,800
You're so quiet

1532
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:59,800
They're busy pointing fingers

1533
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:01,800
Wait, who said strong?

1534
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:03,800
Who said strong is quiet?

1535
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:05,800
Listen to me

1536
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:07,800
Wait, listen to me

1537
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:09,800
We were talking

1538
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,800
Me and Ame were looking

1539
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:13,800
outside of Med Bay

1540
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:15,800
Mercy and

1541
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:17,800
Mercy and Rain

1542
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,800
were in Med Bay together

1543
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,800
Ame went off

1544
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,800
and I went down

1545
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,800
and Rain was dead

1546
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,800
You want me to tell my story?

1547
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,800
I walked into Med Bay

1548
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:31,800
I did the little thing

1549
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,800
I was purple 3

1550
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,800
because I didn't trust Rain

1551
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:37,800
and then I walked outside

1552
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:39,800
I lost Rain for a second

1553
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:41,800
and I saw Azra kill Rain

1554
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:43,800
I saw the body

1555
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,800
You've been so good at gaslighting

1556
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,800
I'm not good at gaslighting

1557
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,800
I'll just fucking say it

1558
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:51,800
I've had so many elves

1559
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,800
I've had so many elves this entire time

1560
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:55,800
I never think it's you

1561
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:57,800
It's Azra but I'm gonna skip

1562
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:59,800
You're gonna

1563
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:01,800
She's gonna aim for me next

1564
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:03,800
Trust me

1565
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:05,800
I was with Ame

1566
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:07,800
Aimee were you there?

1567
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:09,800
Were you there?

1568
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:11,800
Aimee

1569
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,800
Oh my god

1570
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,800
I saw Azra

1571
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:17,800
I didn't see anyone else

1572
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:19,800
Oh my gosh is it Aimee and Azra?

1573
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,800
I think it's Mercy

1574
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,800
Her voice cracked telling her story

1575
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,800
It's a bit shaky

1576
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:27,800
It was

1577
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:29,800
She went for tours

1578
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,800
Watch

1579
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:33,800
Not

1580
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:35,800
Watch this

1581
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:37,800
It's Azra

1582
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,800
Oh no

1583
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:43,800
It's not me

1584
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:45,800
It's really not me

1585
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:47,800
It's not me

1586
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:49,800
Because there is

1587
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:51,800
In Medbay

1588
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:53,800
Keeping an eye

1589
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,800
Keeping an eye on Azra

1590
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,800
You just stay with me

1591
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,800
It's not me

1592
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:01,800
Chicken nuggets

1593
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,800
Chicken wings

1594
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:05,800
French fries

1595
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,800
Potato chips

1596
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:13,800
Potato chips

1597
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,800
Cookies

1598
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:17,800
Oreos

1599
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:19,800
Goldfish

1600
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:29,800
I told ya

1601
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:31,800
I told ya

1602
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:33,800
Step through the heart

1603
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:35,800
I should have voted for it

1604
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:37,800
Even if I voted for Azra it would have been a tie

1605
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:39,800
I had a feeling

1606
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:41,800
I forgot a positive happy cast

1607
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:43,800
That was good

1608
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,800
I'm now satisfied

1609
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:47,800
I'm now satisfied

1610
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:49,800
Everybody she's satisfied

1611
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:51,800
I'm satisfied now

1612
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:53,800
She's so happy now

1613
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:55,800
She's so happy

1614
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:59,800
She won

1615
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:01,800
That was fantastic

1616
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,800
That was so good

1617
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:05,800
I love the friendship

1618
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,800
We gotta play Garchic Phone with you guys

1619
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,800
You guys

1620
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:11,800
You guys trust me at all

1621
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,800
We do

1622
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,800
We do

1623
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:17,800
Great is evil

1624
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,800
This is

1625
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,800
But Strani is dangerous in game

1626
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:23,800
Strani is a dangerous

1627
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:25,800
She knows too much

1628
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:27,800
And she also like

1629
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,800
Very sleepy

1630
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:31,800
I'm proud of Rea

1631
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:33,800
Rea's voice never falters when she's in the roster

1632
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:35,800
Rea is also cutely evil

1633
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:37,800
Rea is so good at this game

1634
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,800
She gets away with so much

1635
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:41,800
And no one just trusts me

1636
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,800
Nobody trusts me

1637
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,800
I'm so proud of you

1638
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:47,800
I got disconnected

1639
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,800
I was about to win

1640
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:51,800
Her eye will laugh

1641
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,800

1653
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,800
Alright

1654
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:19,800
I was like

1655
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,800

1656
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:23,800

1662
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,800

1663
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,800
It's been fantastic

1664
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,800
Close off the game the new

1665
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,800

1666
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:45,800

Bye

1670
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:53,800
Hold on I got to get out of chat

1671
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:57,800
Get out of the call

1672
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,800
Gotta just

1673
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,800
Chatting

1674
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,800
Ah dang it

1675
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:11,800
I knew I forgot something

1676
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:13,800
I knew I forgot something

1677
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,800
I forgot the chat box

1678
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,800
That was really fun wasn't it

1679
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:25,800
Hold on

1680
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:27,800
There you go

1681
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:33,800
Did you have fun

1682
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:35,800
Senpai

1683
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:37,800
It was hilarious right

1684
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:39,800
I think I was imposter

1685
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,800
Way too many times

1686
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:43,800
And I honestly feel like I should be imposter less

1687
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:45,800
Usually I don't ever get imposter

1688
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:47,800
I don't get imposter

1689
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:51,800
Usually I don't get imposter

1690
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,800
But do you guys like the human plus girls

1691
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,800
If you like the human plus girls

1692
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,800
They are so cute

1693
02:07:57,800 --> 02:07:59,800
They are so kind

1694
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:01,800

1695
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:03,800

02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,800
They are the sweetest girls ever

1698
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,800
They've been so kind to us

1699
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:13,800
And yeah I really love

1700
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:15,800
Hang out with more purple girls

1701
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:17,800
And do more collabs like this

1702
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:19,800
I think it would be great

1703
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,800
Are we allowed to do things like that

1704
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,800
Well

1705
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,800
Yes but also

1706
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,800
If you're like

1707
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:31,800
I actually like this girl better than you

1708
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:33,800
Then I might get a little

1709
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,800
I think I might get a little jealous

1710
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:37,800
By a little I mean a lot jealous

1711
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:39,800
And I might get

1712
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,800
I might steal your hammer and just

1713
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:43,800
Understood?

1714
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:47,800
Understood?

1715
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,800
I might get a little jealous

1716
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,800
I might get a little a lot jealous

1717
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:59,800
But honestly I feel like

1718
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:01,800
You will enjoy them

1719
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:03,800
You enjoy them quite a bit

1720
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,800
Especially if

1721
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:07,800
You know having more choices around

1722
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:09,800
Is totally fun

1723
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,800
I will

1724
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:15,800
I

1725
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,800
It's fine, it's fine

1726
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:19,800
But like

1727
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:21,800
Let's talk about like kayfabe

1728
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:23,800
Kayfabe and stuff outside of kayfabe

1729
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:25,800
It's

1730
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,800
It's perfectly fine

1731
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:29,800
It's perfectly fine but I will get a bit jealous

1732
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,800
If I see you in their chat a little bit

1733
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,800
More and then I see you a little less

1734
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:35,800
From me

1735
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,800
I might have to make a

1736
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,800
Vacancy

1737
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:41,800
You might find yourself

1738
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:43,800
With a bone saw

1739
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:45,800
Between your arms

1740
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:47,800
Cutting

1741
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:49,800
Your bones apart

1742
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:55,800
But honestly

1743
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,800
Honestly great fun

1744
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:59,800
Great fun

1745
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:01,800
Honestly great fun

1746
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:03,800
I would

1747
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:05,800
I want to see

1748
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,800
I want to see

1749
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:11,800
I definitely want

1750
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:13,800
To have more collabs

1751
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,800
Since it's

1752
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,800
It's really fun especially

1753
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:19,800
Corporal unity you know

1754
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:21,800
We love corporal unity here

1755
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:23,800
Because

1756
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:25,800
All of us are small corpals

1757
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:27,800
Trying to get by

1758
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:29,800
I had lots of fun

1759
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:31,800
I had lots of fun

1760
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:33,800
I will never blame the girls

1761
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:35,800
But I will blame my senpai

1762
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:37,800
Real fast

1763
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:39,800
Cool

1764
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,800
I have eyes everywhere except for the room

1765
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:43,800
With three dead bodies

1766
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:45,800
You saw I was stuck

1767
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:47,800
I was stuck

1768
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:49,800
I was like no it's downloading

1769
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,800
Shit

1770
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:53,800
That was

1771
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:55,800
That was definitely fun

1772
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:57,800
That was definitely

1773
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:59,800
A pawn moment

1774
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:01,800
Pawn moment from me

1775
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:09,800
I was like wait

1776
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:11,800
Wait a second that's like three bodies

1777
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:13,800
What the fuck

1778
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:15,800
So used

1779
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:17,800
So used to

1780
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:19,800
To dead bodies that I'm just like

1781
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:21,800
Oh shit I didn't fuck

1782
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,800
I didn't notice

1783
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,800
Was so used to it

1784
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:49,800
It was on the eye patch side

1785
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,800
So I couldn't help it

1786
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:53,800
Yeah that's real

1787
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:55,800
You ever just like

1788
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:57,800
Suddenly go

1789
02:11:57,800 --> 02:11:59,800
Oh

1790
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:01,800
I see

1791
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:05,800
But yeah

1792
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,800
Let's go over our schedule again

1793
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,800
Let's see what my schedule is like

1794
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:21,800
Tomorrow

1795
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:23,800
I'm playing I'm continuing

1796
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:25,800
Death mark

1797
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:27,800
And then after that I have nothing

1798
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:29,800
For the rest of the week except

1799
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:31,800
For

1800
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:33,800
My SMT knock turn

1801
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:35,800
Memba stream

1802
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:37,800
So

1803
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:39,800
Remember

1804
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:41,800
That it's on

1805
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:43,800

1806
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:45,800
And we'll make it

1807
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:47,800
Memberable

1808
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:49,800
Yeah

1809
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:53,800
So

1810
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:13,800
So remember

1811
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:15,800
It is a member's only stream

1812
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:17,800
So remember

1813
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,800
Remember

1814
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,800

1815
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:25,800
Membralize it

1816
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:41,800
So yeah that's on Friday

02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:43,800

I'm still

1826
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,800
Working around next week's schedule

1827
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:07,800
And hopefully we'll have

1828
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:11,800
A good old time

1829
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:15,800
A good old time

1830
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:17,800
Talk about stuff

1831
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:19,800
Hopefully it's enjoyable

1832
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:21,800
It's enjoyable for a member's stream

1833
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:23,800
It's gonna be my first member's stream

1834
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:27,800
