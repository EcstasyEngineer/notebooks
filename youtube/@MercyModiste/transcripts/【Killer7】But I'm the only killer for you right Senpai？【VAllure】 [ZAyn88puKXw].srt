00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:29,820
Hello everyone give me a second.

2
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,100
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta get rid of,

3
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,640
get rid of the, my mercy theme.

4
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,900
Silence, silence.

5
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,380
You guys want to hear the game, right?

6
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,580
I'm a mama mama mama.

7
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,900
Oh no, wait, you can't even hear the game.

8
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

9
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,580
Oh, I'm kind of dumb.

10
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,940
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

11
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,180
Oh, my bad.

12
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,860
How do I do this again?

13
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,140
Oh my gosh.

14
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,740
It's so funny, I'm like, yeah, I have everything ready.

15
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,460
I set up my controller.

16
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,340
I made sure everything's fine.

17
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,660
Of course I forget one thing.

18
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,780
Tee hee, pet up.

19
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,780
Oh, let's call this, uh, monitor sound.

20
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,220
I got so nervous I had to run to the bathroom.

21
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,580
I mean, I ran to my idle meeting.

22
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
Uh-huh.

23
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,220
Is this the one?

24
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,460
No, I set my idle meeting.

25
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,500
Shut up.

26
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,340
Did you wash your hands?

27
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,780
Of course I washed my hands.

28
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,540
Is this the right one?

29
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Oh, that's bad, that's bad that I can't do this.

30
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,220
Where is my sounds?

31
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,100
Where's my monitor sounds?

32
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,940
Thank you.

33
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,020
Is this dumb?

34
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
Okay.

35
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,540
Hello?

36
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,580
Hello, hello?

37
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,700
You guys can hear it now, right?

38
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
Ha ha ha ha ha.

39
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,420
Yay.

40
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,940
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

41
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,340
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

42
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,780
How's the volume for everyone?

43
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,220
I'm gonna adjust my own volume

44
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,860
just so I can hear some more,

45
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,620
but the volume for a bit, a bit, it's a little different.

46
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,940
Some five?

47
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,780
Let me know, okay?

48
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,820
Okay, okay, okay.

49
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,380
It's all good, a little bit loud.

50
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,380
I can pull it down a little bit for, for,

51
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,140
for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for,

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,540

53
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,180
for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for,

54
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,020
for, for for, for, for.

55
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,380
For, for for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for for.

56
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,580
For, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for.

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,580
For, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for so good,

58
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580

For, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for for, for, for,

60
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:49,540
I want to play on normal.

61
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,780
You guys are not going to complain about normal, right?

62
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:00,500
My senpais aren't going to complain about normal, right?

63
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Normal is fine.

64
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm an auntie nausea pill, about 15 minutes before spring, so it should, it should kick in, yes.

65
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Wait.

66
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,100
I forgot I'm using an Xbox controller!

67
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Wow, dumbass!

68
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Ahahaha!

69
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Target Angel!

70
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,100
January 20th, 2010 winter.

71
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Huh?

72
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,900
Look at him in his low wiggly fingers!

73
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,100
What is he wiggling at?

74
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,500
Is he going to tickle you?

75
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,100
Huh?

76
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,700
I can't read this.

77
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Hahaha!

78
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Oh, by the way, I am playing on the Xbox controller.

79
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,700
Um, I read that there's like mixed reviews on the controls, so I'm going to try my best.

80
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Garcian Smith.

81
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Did I totally butcher that name?

82
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Hahaha!

83
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:41,700
Oh yeah, I set up dynamic lighting and everything, so we can have feels.

84
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Oh, they're passing each other.

85
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,700
What are they passing?

86
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Christopher Mills.

87
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
What are they passing?

88
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
Is it drugs?

89
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Is it a video game?

90
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Kenchi Angel, thank you.

91
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Is that, uh, what case is that for?

92
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
A violin?

93
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Haha, passing the mixtape?

94
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Yeah, check out my mixtape.

95
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
It's me.

96
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
So you there yet?

97
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
It's me!

98
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
So you there yet?

99
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Yeah.

100
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
That's where they all hang out.

101
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Your information tells us that there's 14 of them.

102
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
14?

103
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
And they're all fun.

104
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Nah, I keep one alive so we can ask for the bosses.

105
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Anything else I shouldn't know?

106
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
No.

107
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Not really.

108
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,700
You'll know when you see them, they're, uh, different.

109
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
What do you mean different?

110
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
We'll do one.

111
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
May the Lord smile.

112
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
And the devil have mercy.

113
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Have you ever played Mass Effect?

114
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,700
No, I have very bad motion sickness, so this is my motion sickness training, everyone!

115
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,700
A free-for-all fight in the multi-purpose facility's Celtic Building, assignment number 33.

116
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Destroy the Heaven Smile headquarters and capture the chief alive!

117
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Hahaha!

118
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
I can do that.

119
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,700
Do you wish to learn the controls?

120
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Yeah!

121
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Use A to run.

122
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Huh?

123
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Oh!

124
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Use B to change directions.

125
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Use R...

126
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Right trigger.

127
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,700
That was my left.

128
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
Ready your weapon.

129
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Lock on your targets.

130
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Use the...

131
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
Scan for enemies.

132
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Oh!

133
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Whoa!

134
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Whoa!

135
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
Whoa!

136
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Oh, wait, what?

137
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Scan for enemies.

138
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Oh!

139
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
Whoa!

140
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Whoa!

141
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
Oh, wait, what?

142
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Okay.

143
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Okay.

144
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Wait a minute.

145
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Like this?

146
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Oh!

My friends are all dead

194
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,440
Your voice is a kid you do not look like a kid!

195
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,440
Looks like what?

Can I talk to him now?

203
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,800
Or is this just a tutorial again?

204
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Master!

205
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,320
Okay, a real tight spot, right in a real tight spot, yeah, yeah, yeah, like I haven't seen

206
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
you for ages.

207
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,040
Where are you see through?

208
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,640
It is I, Vincil Dill Boris Will.

209
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,760
It was out of school at your service, just call me, it was out of, okay, okay, let me

210
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:36,440
show you along the way to the right master's room, okay, straight ahead the enemy.

211
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:45,760
Let the bloodbath begin in the name of Harman, who the heck is Harman?

212
00:21:45,760 --> 00:22:10,080
I think something's coming towards me, what the hell?

213
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:28,240
Oh, wait, I had to scan first, that's fine, that's fine, we got this, we got this, we

214
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
got this.

215
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,120
Master, yes, yes, yes, we're in a tight spot, yeah, I know, tight and out of sight.

216
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,960
Let me make a suggestion, uh-huh, uh-huh.

217
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:47,000
We must turn back, this is the enemy's den, shudder to think their bodies are lined with

218
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:58,120
bombs, bombs, they'll bomb rush you, literally, eliminate them before they blow, in the name

219
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:22,840
of Harman, they're wearing bombs, oh shit, oh sorry, whatever, I don't remember anything,

220
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,840
your chief killed me, funky, okay, funky man, you already forgot, yeah, I forgot, I'm

222
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,520
honest here, you think I'm a pain in the ass, don't you, hey Smith, I ain't letting you

223
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:56,680
go nowhere, I don't want to kill you, but I will, what the fuck, hold on, am I, am I,

226
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:35,240

227
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:56,880
I mean, I mean, somebody's hanging around, can you get that for me, fine, he was out

228
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:05,560
secrets, master, we're in a tight spot, okay, okay, that guy is a true freak, yeah, yeah,

229
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:14,000
but don't be alarmed, he's my trusted companion, Kikazaru, those things that master seek, the

230
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,320
bullets, he loves them so, the bullets were left behind by masters, so the servants searched

231
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for them tirelessly, bullets of the soul, otherwise known as soul shells, in the name

232
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:51,800
of Harman, wait, do I have limited bullets, bullets, okay, here we go,

233
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,560

00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
I didn't have to do anything, yeah!

00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:45,240
Where's my son, there you go, I'm gonna call you my son now, I have adopted you, you are

236
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,720

237
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,720
for terror, with the helion use the R button and press the Y button three times, wait what,

238
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:07,360
when the test tube fills up with blood, you can fire a deadly shot, the devil's bullet,

239
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:15,520
he can only fire with enough blood, it's the right button and Y three times, in the name of

240
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:36,360
Harman, okay, let's turn back now, so do I go here, one, wait, one two three, one two three,

241
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:54,320

242
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,800
okay, I can't, I forgot, it was this one and then we scan right, like this,

243
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:32,400
so life personality and press the A button,

244
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:48,240
what, what, what, what, personality changes, wild, okay fuck it,

245
00:28:48,240 --> 00:29:01,480

246
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:25,720
character, what, wait so I only have, I only have six lives, seven lives, sorry,

247
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:44,520
so that's bad because I am an idiot, I am an idiot, there's a lot of controls right now,

248
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:55,480
it's pretty dope, actually yeah this is pretty dope, I just, I'm just kind of stupid, I'm kind of

249
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:13,160
stupid, there's a lot of things I have to remember, okay, I'm slowly getting it, do not safe, I'm sorry,

250
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:23,240
Senpai, I'm sorry Senpai, I'm very bad at games, it's a crazy game and it has a crazy learning

251
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:42,680
curve, okay, okay, okay, I should save, okay, it's a little, it's a little tough, I admit, it's a

252
00:30:43,400 --> 00:31:00,840
little tough, the Samantha just, what do I do with the TV, oh, okay, I see it, I understand,

253
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,000
okay so that's where I change the personalities, we're learning together,

254
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,520
what's that do, now you give,

255
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:33,880

257
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
we're in a tight spot, I know, I know what you're hanging, it's the button arrangement,

258
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,440
run with the A button, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, turn around with the B button, high, high, high, high,

259
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,560
press the B button while running to turn quick, a little practice travel will be a breeze,

260
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,040
I pray for your speedy mastery, the name of Haruma,

261
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,920
okay, I don't want to study, it's okay, we're gonna study together, this is how we learn things,

262
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:21,480
junctions, what is junctions, master, we're in a tight spot, you need a sense of direction,

263
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:30,920
have you got used to the junctions, here's how to read them, junctions that you've already passed turn

264
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:43,000
blue, junctions that you have not passed are clear, if you get confused, follow the gray to come back,

265
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,480
the name of Haruma, okay, okay,

266
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,480
did he just, I feel like I got called out for a second senpai, where, where,

267
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:13,880
where, where my little gimp son has told me that I am, I have a bad sense of direction,

268
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:23,720
vitalities, okay, master, we're in a tight spot, I just, I can just sense it, look at those eyes,

269
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:31,960
eyes that see right through you, as they close, the member weakens,

270
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:41,480
when they shut completely, the member dies, you must continue to feed it blood, oh we're gonna

271
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:50,280
feed blood to our member, huh, you can use a test tube, when the eyes turn red, keep an eye on them,

272
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,960
the name of Haruma, okay, okay, we're going through this,

273
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:10,360
we're in a tight spot, you need to learn the basics, oh shut up, I mean, okay,

select that, with the control stick and the A button, move up to change personas, okay,

276
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,480

283
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,560

286
00:35:53,240 --> 00:36:05,460
Azura, oh thank you Azura for the raid, Azura, Azura, Azura, Azura,

287
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,180
Da, da, da, da, da, da, assou da da da.

288
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

289
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sempai's, assou da.

290
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,340
Okay, Xbox controller should be the ones

291
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,740
with the two squares on it.

292
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,500
Well, it says return to title screen.

293
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,040
Do I have to do it while in this screen instead?

294
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,700
Or maybe I just don't have items yet.

295
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,900
Whatever.

296
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,700
But welcome everyone.

297
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
I'm just having trouble with controls right now.

298
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,340
So I'm doing a little bit of studying.

299
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,800
A little bit of studying

300
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,020
because this game's a little bit funky,

301
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,300
but we'll get it, we'll get it.

302
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,540
I mean, I, admittedly, the games I played,

303
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,060
two to 51 games I played, Killer is Dead.

304
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,260
I thought I played Killer Seven at first,

305
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,260
but it turns out I was playing Killer is Dead instead.

306
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,860
I need a rhyme.

307
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:24,340
And I played The Silver Case.

308
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,300
I've also played, what's the sequel to The Silver Case?

309
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,140
That one.

310
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,780
And I think that's it.

311
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,180
I think that's it.

312
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,420
All I played of two to 51 games.

313
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,220
So those are the games that I've played.

314
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,660
I'm not very familiar with this type of gameplay.

315
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,660
I'm very bad at shooty games

316
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,940
because I've never played shooting a game before as well.

317
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,060
Did you understand The Silver Case?

318
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:13,060
I really liked The Silver Case the most.

319
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,540
I went through all 100 endings of the sequel.

320
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,380
What was it called again?

321
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,300
The 25th Ward.

322
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,140
Yeah.

323
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,780
It was great.

324
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,780
So I like that game, but it was more of a,

325
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,260
it was more of a, what do you call it?

326
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,460
More of a visual novel in my opinion.

327
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,260
It was more of a visual novel, a little bit of walking.

328
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,460
So I think that was fine.

329
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,780
So I did all the endings and then all I got was,

330
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,940
oh no, should I?

331
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,540
Oh no, that's a spoiler, right?

332
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,980
That's a spoiler, right?

333
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,380
I don't know if I can spoil it.

334
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,820
Yeah, I'm not gonna spoil it.

335
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,620
Mm.

336
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,740
Was it disappointing?

337
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,100
You can spoil it?

338
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,820
Mm, okay, okay.

339
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,860
Well, it's only because Senpai said that I can spoil it.

340
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,220
Well, all you have to get is Kamali telling you,

341
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,860

357
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,420
I don't regret it, but definitely,

358
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,580
I know what I'm getting into,

359
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,540
it's just that I gotta get used to the game play.

360
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,660
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

361
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Speaking of MLMs, have you guys, have my Senpais.

Ooh, okay, we're in a tight spot, sorry.

363
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,380

00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,020
Mm, mm, mm, mm, okay.

366

00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,260
follow the icon, in the name of Harman.

368

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

369
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,060
Continuing that story, sorry about that.

370
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,460
I acted, my fingies clicked faster than I could.

371
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,620
Oh, just give me a second.

372
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,820
I'm gonna just close this window.

373
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,740
Sistracting.

374
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,180
Ha ha ha, excuse me.

375
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,220
Let me just, have you guys ever,

376
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:41,220
have my Senpais ever gotten tricked into,

377
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:46,220
into like going to a pyramid scheme party before?

378
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,420
Ha ha ha, because I have,

379
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,420
ha ha ha ha, I have an old friend from high school

380
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,100
was like, we love to meet up again.

381
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,820
And I said, yeah, sure.

382
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,980
Then I thought about it for a second.

383
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,820
I said, it's not a pyramid scheme, is it?

384
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,740
They assured me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

385
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,140
It's not a, it's not a pyramid scheme.

386
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,740
Just come over and we'll hang out, like good old times.

387
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,580
I said, okay.

388
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,820
So I drive all the way there.

389
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,940
All the way to there, in the middle of nowhere.

390
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,140
Ha ha ha.

391
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,900
I thought I was gonna die.

392
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,620
Because it was so far away, there were no lights

393
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,860
or anything, I was really worried.

394
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,980
I was like, where the heck?

395
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,500
So I got to a very opulent mansion.

396
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,900
I'm sorry, I'm telling you guys,

397
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,620
I'm telling you my supplies of story.

398
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
Well, it doesn't matter,

399
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,660
you're stuck in the basement anyways.

400
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,820
Opulent mansion with like barely anything in it.

401
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,820
So I walk in and I meet her friends

402
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,460
who are showing off their opulent mansion

403
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,660
with their quote unquote

404
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:22,540
real medieval night suits, whatever it is, you know?

405
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,260
They have one, they said it's authentic.

406
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,180
I was like, it ain't authentic, brother.

407
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,740
It's not authentic, it was that shiny.

408
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,300
Yeah, they're like, it's a medieval, it's old, it's there.

409
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,500
And then I see this product around and then

410
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,940
I basically just said, look, just give me the whole fricking,

411
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,860
give me the whole fricking story right now.

412
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,620
I'm tired, please just give me the whole spiel right now.

413
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,580
So they sat me down and then they gave me the whole spiel

414
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,980
and then I said, that's nice, I'm gonna go eat now.

415
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,540
And I ate all the charcuterie board

416
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,100
and like the energy drinks and I brought them home with me

417
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,220
and then I left.

418
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,220
Great times.

419
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:51,660

00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,580
Hands me a literal pamphlet with a literal pyramid

421

533
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,300
Senpai's don't mind that I'm going through all of this

534
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:13,260
master we're in a tight spot not really that tight let me explain how blood

535
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:22,140
works the blood in the beaker is pure give blood to the doctor inside the TV

536
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:29,740
the doctor may look a bit off but he's a true gentleman he won't do you wrong

537
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:36,380
prepare blood serums for you use them to give personas a heightened consciousness

538
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:46,060
level up this allows a member to achieve special attacks in the name of Harman

539
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,740
all right

540
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:59,660
all right all right blood absorption master we're in a tight spot this blood

541
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:08,100
is scary stuff but without blood there is no tomorrow the persona can absorb the

542
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,460
blood out of the enemy and acts as a stabilizer to help handle multiple

543
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:22,340
personalities without blood your very life is in danger press start slash pause

544
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:35,460

the condition of each persona and only use those in good shape restore

548
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:04,900
condition by taking out the enemy if you exterminate enough you can wake up

549
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:13,900

Oh, I can resurrect him.

605
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,220
Press the R button rapidly.

606
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,220
Oh, A button, never mind. That's not A.

607
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,220
Sorry, I thought that was R.

608
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,220
Alright!

609
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,220
Sorry, it looked like an R.

610
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:14,220
Should I select Dan again?

611
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,220
Maybe I should use him again.

612
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,220
Yeah, let's use him again.

613
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,220

01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,220
What are you drinking, Kohai?

618
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,220
Um, tea.

619
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,220
I think it's a peppermint tea.

620
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:01,220
Okay, now I can probably do Dan better.

621
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:03,220
That was so rude.

622
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,220
Okay, we game in!

623
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:30,220

01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,220
Okay.

627
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,220
Understood.

628
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,220
Ah!

629
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:41,220

635
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,220
I think I'm too close!

636
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,220
Ah!

637
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,220
Ah, I was too close!

638
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,220
Ah!

639
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,220
I was too close!

640
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:32,220
Ah!

641
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,220
I was too close!

642
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,220
I was too s-

643
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,220
Sorry!

644
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:45,220
Sorry, Garcian!

645
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:51,220
I'm gonna have to use your services again.

646
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,220
Sorry!

647
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,220
Oops!

648
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,220
You got better, though!

649
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,220
Yeah, I'm getting better!

650
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,220
Just a little bit.

651
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,220
I'm trying to kinda still understand the mechanics.

652
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:20,220
It's a little tough, but I think I got quite a bit of it.

653
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,220
Ah!

654
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,220
Look, I'm a cleaner.

655
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,220
I can feel no remorse for seeing that.

656
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,220
Ah!

657
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,220
Yeah, you gotta keep my distance with those eggs.

658
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,220
This time real.

659
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,220
Probably.

660
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:14,220
I'm a little confused about how to do the...

661
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:16,220
the special move again.

662
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:21,220
I know it's R and then hitting the Y button three times, right?

663
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,220
Do I smash?

664
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,220
I'll try my best.

665
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,220
Whatever.

666
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:28,220
When it comes, it comes.

667
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,220
Okay.

668
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,220
I'm bad.

669
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,220
Ah!

670
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,220
Not again!

671
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,220
Ah!

672
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,220
This is too easy.

673
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,220
They crawl so fast!

674
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,220
Ah!

675
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,220
This is too easy.

676
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,220
This is too easy.

677
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:02,220
Wait, where's the weakness?

678
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,220
A little shot.

679
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,220
You guys are so close!

680
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,220
I understand!

681
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,220
I understand it!

682
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,220
This is just a duplicator.

683
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:57,220
Bad girl!

684
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:00,220
An egg laying heaven smile.

685
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,220
Refitted to clamp down on the city.

686
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:06,220
This sucker pumped out the countless duplicates

687
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:09,220
that took this country down.

688
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:11,220
Hey, Smith.

689
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:15,220
It's your job to eradicate heaven smile, right?

690
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,220
And seek the queen.

691
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:24,220
The gatekeeper is in charge of the queen.

692
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,220
Give this to the gatekeeper.

693
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,220
He won't be disappointed.

694
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,220
Is that Pizza Hut?

695
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,220
Is that the Pizza Hut love?

696
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:37,220
Pull it.

697
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:41,220
Received Soul Shell.

698
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,220
Okay.

699
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:59,220
Is that Pizza Hut logo?

700
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,220
Yeah.

701
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,220
I did it!

702
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:07,220
Are you guys, are my supplies proud of me?

703
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,220
Can I get a head pat?

704
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,220
Okay, I did it.

705
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:21,220
I feel a little happy that I did it.

706
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,220
I guess I have to just go back now.

707
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:29,220
Yay, thank you, some pies.

708
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,220
Huh?

709
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:54,220
Huh?

710
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,220
Did I go this way?

711
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,220
Oh!

712
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

713
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,220
Wait.

714
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:23,220
Oh my gosh!

715
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:27,220
My little gimp son spooked me for a second!

716
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:39,220
Master, we're in a tight spot.

717
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,220
An ultra tight spot.

718
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,220
Life is precious.

719
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,220
And the enemies mean business.

720
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,220
They're called heaven smile.

721
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,220
Look at their eyes.

722
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:54,220
There's nothing heavenly about them.

723
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:56,220
In the name of Harmon.

724
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:59,220
Wait, maybe I should go back.

725
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,220
Maybe I should go back and save?

726
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,220
What do you think?

727
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:16,220
Maybe I should go back to the save.

728
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:19,220
Yeah.

729
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:23,220
Since I'm very new, I just beat that little...

730
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,220
Yeah.

731
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:39,220
Okay.

732
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:00,220
Harmon's room?

733
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:02,220
Is that the one I need to go to?

734
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:03,220
Yes.

735
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,220
Samantha.

736
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,220
Okay.

737
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,220
Let's overwrite this one.

738
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,220
Yes.

739
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,220
We're good.

740
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:32,220
Okay, we're good now.

741
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,220
How's your head feeling so far, Mercy?

742
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,220
I think it's okay.

743
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,220
Okay.

744
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:01,220
I don't know if this game is...

745
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,220
What do you call it?

746
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:06,220
Um...

747
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:09,220
If it would be like a game that

748
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,220
a major company would fund nowadays.

749
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,220
But it seems really cool.

750
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,220
Once you get used to it, I think

751
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:20,220
once you get used to the controls, it takes a while, but I get it.

752
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,220
Huh?

753
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:35,220
Ah!

754
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,220
Hey, I'm not...

755
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,220
Okay.

756
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,220
Any motherfuckers?

757
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,220
Any other motherfuckers here?

758
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,220
Thank you.

759
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:39,220
Oh!

760
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,220
Oh my God!

761
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,220
I could have just saved up here?

762
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:43,220
Wow!

763
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:49,220
Jeez, are you...

764
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,220
She's scared.

765
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,220
This is the...

766
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,220
This is the scary, right?

767
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:54,220
This is the scary one, right?

768
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:56,220
Is she gonna attack me?

769
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,220
Do I talk to her?

770
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:06,220
Should I talk to her?

771
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:12,220
Okay, well, I'll talk to her.

772
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,220
Never mind.

773
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,220
I'm just gonna go to the telly.

774
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,220
Who the hell is this?

775
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:33,220
I've changed my makeup.

776
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,220
Did you notice?

777
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:39,220
What did you say?

778
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,220
Later.

779
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,220
Oh, they're all Smith!

780
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:44,220
I just realized they're all Smith.

781
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,220
Okay, we're slowly unlocking them.

782
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,220
Understood.

783
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,220
No, okay.

784
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,220
Is there anything else she has in here?

785
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:17,220
No?

786
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:25,220
Can I talk to her?

787
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,220
Or is she just gonna...

788
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,220
Is she just gonna just, like, stare at me like that?

789
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:36,220
Or is she just gonna...

790
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,220
Oh, shit.

791
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,220
Oh, shit.

792
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:41,220
No!

793
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,220
Okay.

794
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:00,220
I had a moment.

795
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:01,220
I'm sorry.

796
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:03,220
I forgot how the game worked.

797
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:06,220
I'm sorry.

798
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,220
I forgot how the game worked.

799
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,220
I forgot how the game worked.

800
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:29,220
I forgot how it worked.

801
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,220
What the heck is that?

802
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:56,220
I nearly fucking died!

803
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:10,220
Ah!

804
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,220
What the fuck?

805
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,220
I'm lost now.

806
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:33,220
I got lost.

807
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,220
That was a truck!

808
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:40,220
X to pull up map.

809
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,220
Where am I?

810
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:06,220
Holy shit, Travis scared me again!

811
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:10,220
Ah!

812
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:14,220
Let's talk serious for a second.

813
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:18,220
Heaven's smile, they're holy warriors.

814
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:20,220
Shit, ain't that pretty wicked?

815
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:23,220
Warriors who fight with the holy will on their side

816
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:25,220
and use death as a weapon.

817
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,220
Their target?

818
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:29,220
The very dignity of the country itself.

819
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,220
Well, why should you understand the meaning?

820
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,220
Shit, you're a killer after all.

821
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:40,220
Oh my gosh, he just fucking scared me!

822
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,220
I guess this means...

823
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:53,220
Is green a color I didn't know?

824
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:17,220
Hahahaha!

825
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:21,220
Come on.

826
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:23,220
You gotta help me.

827
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:27,220
Ah!

828
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:32,220
Bean.

829
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,220
Oh!

830
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,220
Who are you?

831
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:49,220
Oh, like old times, huh?

832
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:51,220
Tell me how's old Smith?

833
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:55,220
Things going good with Mills, no?

834
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,220
That old Smith, not much of a successor.

835
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,220
But good man, yes.

836
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,220
Thank you, much gratitude.

837
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:08,220
Ready for today's hint?

838
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:12,220
I checked the candlesticks.

839
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:16,220
A strange design indeed is...

840
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,220
It is hidden there.

841
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:21,220
The order is hidden here.

842
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,220
Want to know more?

843
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:26,220
Then use this mask.

844
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:28,220
I'll be right back.

845
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:30,220
I'll be right back.

846
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:32,220
Want to know more?

847
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:35,220
Then use this mask.

848
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:41,220
Shoot the mask, and the mask will tell you.

849
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:45,220
But watch out!

850
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,220
This mask's lust for blood.

851
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:50,220
Thicker blood.

852
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,220
Demon lust for blood, yes?

853
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:56,220
If you're brave, shoot the mask.

854
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,220
Shoot the mask.

855
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:02,220
It'll tell you everything.

856
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:07,220
Am I close to a save point?

857
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:09,220
Hold on.

858
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,220
Where am I exactly?

859
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:28,220
You're...

860
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:31,220
You're in the yellow by the hand icon.

861
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:43,220
This map's hard to read.

862
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:49,220
You're next to the hand and ring symbol, I think.

863
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:59,220
Okay.

864
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:03,220
How much further is the save?

865
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:10,220
Okay.

866
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:12,220
I'm facing south, okay.

867
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,220
Yeah, I have to...

868
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,220
I have seen more useful maps in games, I admit.

869
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:21,220
Yeah, that's kinda hard.

870
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:23,220
So...

871
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,220
Okay, I'll shoot it.

872
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:29,220
It's not gonna come attack me, right?

873
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:45,220
Is it gonna attack me?

874
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:47,220
Okay.

875
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:55,220
I've beaten this game a million times.

876
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:58,220
I'm so glad I have, I have senpai's,

877
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:00,220
seasoned senpai's for this game,

878
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:04,220
because I am a little bit confuzzled at times.

879
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:06,220
Okay.

880
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,220
Okay.

881
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:18,220
So how do I shoot the mask?

882
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:33,220
Just aim like normal, okay.

883
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:37,220
Okay.

884
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,220
With your gun, okay.

885
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:42,220
I know with my gun, but I'm like, do I...

886
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:44,220
Like...

887
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:46,220
Like this?

888
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:56,220
Wait.

889
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:59,220
Did he just...

890
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:02,220
Did he just give me the middle finger?

891
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:05,220
So, you are the worthless loser.

892
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:07,220
What a pitiful existence.

893
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:09,220
I am the true mask.

894
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:14,220
And I shall guide you.

895
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,220
The ring of fire

896
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:22,220
and number shown on the candlestick.

897
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:25,220
From one to five,

898
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:29,220
follow the order and ignite the flames.

899
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:32,220
Tomorrow, it could be you.

900
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:35,220
Son of a bitch,

901
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:38,220
he's just given me the middle finger.

902
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:54,220
This one?

903
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,220
This one?

904
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,220
Insufficient flame.

905
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,220
Eh?

906
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:19,220
I didn't even know there was a room there!

907
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:30,220
Shit.

908
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:40,220
Sorry.

909
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:42,220
At a moment.

910
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:44,220
Oops.

911
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:47,220
Sorry.

912
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:01,220
Please help me.

913
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,220
It suddenly disappeared.

914
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:06,220
A white light flashed before me.

915
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:08,220
Everything is transparent.

916
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,220
I held his hand.

917
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,220
Whose hand was it?

918
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:17,220
Then, before I knew it, I was lost again.

919
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:19,220
Please help me.

920
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:21,220
I can't see a thing.

921
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:30,220
I don't think I finished exploring here.

922
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:37,220
What the fuck happened?

923
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:39,220
Oops.

924
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:43,220
What happened?

925
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:46,220
Wait, was that the woman I saw before? Never mind.

926
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,220
I know what happened.

927
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:58,220
I don't remember which way I went.

928
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:08,220
It's locked from the other side.

929
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:11,220
Okay.

930
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,220
Power.

931
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:41,220
What was that?

932
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,220
Did I go to here already?

933
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:50,220
I feel like I've already been here.

934
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,220
Yeah, you have.

935
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,220
I've been here already.

936
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,220
Okay.

937
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:58,220
Wow, I'm silly, Billy.

938
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,220
What's that?

939
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,220
What's that?

940
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:04,220
Did I go to here already?

941
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:08,220
I feel like I've already been here.

942
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:10,220
Did I go to here already?

943
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:12,220
Yeah, you have.

944
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:14,220
I've been here already.

945
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:16,220
Okay.

946
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:18,220
Wow, I'm silly, Billy.

947
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:20,220
I got really confused.

948
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:22,220
Sorry.

949
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:50,220
Oh, right.

950
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:52,220
Travis was here.

951
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:54,220
My bad.

952
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:56,220
That was the wrong way.

953
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,220
Okay.

954
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:30,220
Okay.

955
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,220
I'm starting to get it.

956
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:44,220
Bro!

957
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:46,220
Master!

958
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:48,220
We're in a tight spot.

959
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:50,220
A major tight spot.

960
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:52,220
He's here.

961
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,220
Yes, him!

962
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:56,220
Master, you can't.

963
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,220
You're going to go and kill him?

964
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:04,220
What?

965
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:06,220
Impossible.

966
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:08,220
You're a fool.

967
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:10,220
And you're a go-

968
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:12,220
You can't read.

969
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,220
Impossible. You're sure to fail.

970
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,220
You know nothing of his strength.

971
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:18,220
All stupid, stupid master.

972
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:20,220
That mill's really fooled you.

973
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:24,220
In the name of the fool.

974
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,220
Should I...

975
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:34,220
Do I have flames?

976
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:36,220
Does do...

977
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:38,220
Do I have flames?

978
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:40,220
Hahaha.

979
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:42,220
Nobody has faith in me.

980
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:44,220
It's fine.

981
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:46,220
I don't even have faith in myself.

982
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:02,220
This way?

983
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:04,220
Oh, carry your pigeon.

984
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:08,220
Give me the pigeon.

985
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:12,220
Dear Amir.

986
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:14,220
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance

987
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:16,220
and many thanks for choosing me for the job.

988
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:18,220
My name is Johnny Gagnan.

989
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,220
Otherwise known as

990
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,220
Speedster.

991
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,220
Okay.

992
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:26,220
I get excited when I slit a guy's throat.

993
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:28,220
I know that may be sick,

994
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:30,220
but I do the best work in town.

995
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:32,220
This is a report on the job.

996
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:34,220
I'm sure you'll like what I have to say.

997
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:36,220
I watch them like a hawk.

998
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:38,220
So I think a hefty reward is an order.

999
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:40,220
There are seven in the Smith's Indian.

1000
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:42,220
Dear Smith.

1001
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:44,220
Who uses a large caliber revolver?

1002
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,220
Hi, Dace.

1003
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:48,220
No, not dear.

1004
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:50,220
Dan Smith.

1005
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:52,220
Wow.

1006
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:54,220
Gagnan, these nuts.

1007
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:56,220
Shut up!

1008
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,220
Hahaha.

1009
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:00,220
Feeling a little too relatable to the text?

1010
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:02,220
Maybe a little bit.

1011
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,220
Who uses a large automatic rifle?

1012
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,220
Okay.

1013
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,220
Hi, Dace Smith.

1014
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:28,220
Who uses a large automatic rifle?

1015
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:30,220
Colin Smith.

1016
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:32,220
Who uses two full auto pistols?

1017
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:34,220
Masked a Smith.

1018
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:36,220
Who uses grenades?

1019
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,220
Kevin Smith.

1020
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:40,220
Who uses knives?

1021
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:42,220
What are these names?

1022
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:52,220
Coyote Smith.

1023
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,220
Who uses a modified gun?

1024
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:56,220
Christian Smith. Who uses a small pistol?

1025
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:58,220
They are an armed force

1026
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:00,220
that rivals a small army.

1027
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:06,220
You wouldn't want to be on their bad side.

1028
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:08,220
In conclusion, it is in

1029
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,220
the interest of the United States

1030
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:12,220
to keep them around.

1031
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:14,220
There's no telling when they might come in handy.

1032
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:22,220
Meet the Smiths.

1033
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:24,220
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1034
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:26,220
I'll be contacting you again.

1035
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,220
Johnny Gagnan.

1036
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:32,220
Oh!

1037
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:34,220
Obtained career memo.

1038
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:40,220
I guess I got to turn back then.

1039
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:48,220
Can I save now?

1040
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:54,220
Maybe not?

1041
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:56,220
Maybe not?

1042
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:06,220
I want to see the telly.

1043
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:08,220
Don't make me say it again.

1044
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,220
Wait here.

1045
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,220
I've changed my makeup.

1046
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,220
Did you notice?

1047
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:18,220
Kevin!

1048
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:20,220
What did you say?

1049
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:22,220
Later.

1050
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:24,220
Peace.

1051
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:30,220
Masked a Smith.

1052
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:32,220
I can wake them up.

1053
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,220
Can I wake them up, guys?

1054
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:36,220
Is it in my best interest

1055
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:38,220
to wake them up?

1056
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:50,220
Don't make me say it again.

1057
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,220
Wait here.

1058
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:54,220
I've changed my makeup.

1059
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:56,220
What did you say?

1060
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,220
Later.

1061
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,220
Masked a Smith.

1062
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,220
Oh!

1063
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:12,220
He's really wearing a luchador mask.

1064
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:18,220
Wow.

1065
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:20,220
Later.

1066
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:22,220
What about this one? Can I wake this one up?

1067
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:24,220
Kevin, you're a little bit gangly.

1068
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:34,220
Why are you so tall?

1069
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:50,220
Is Kevin any good?

1070
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:54,220
He's so...

1071
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:56,220
He's so...

1072
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:58,220
He's so gangly.

1073
01:48:58,220 --> 01:49:00,220
Later.

1074
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:02,220
Peace.

1075
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:04,220
Destiny.

1076
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:06,220
Did he just say destiny?

1077
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:10,220
There's 11 channels. Does that mean I have?

1078
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,220
Don't make me say it again.

1079
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,220
Wait here.

1080
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,220
I've changed my makeup.

1081
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,220
Wait here.

1082
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:30,220
What did you say?

1083
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:32,220
Later.

1084
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:34,220
Destiny.

1085
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:36,220
Destiny.

1086
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:38,220
That's all he said. It was just destiny.

1087
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:44,220
Are you sure you'll be calling anyone gangly?

1088
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:48,220
I have the right to insult anyone.

1089
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,220
I have the right to insult anyone.

1090
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:52,220
Also, it's Killer7, but there's

1091
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:54,220
11 channels.

1092
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:00,220
Great serum from Blood by pressing

1093
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,220
the A button.

1094
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:06,220
Select Personality

1095
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,220
and press the A button.

1096
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:10,220
Wait here.

1097
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:12,220
I've changed my makeup. Did you know?

1098
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:14,220
What did you say?

1099
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:16,220
Later.

1100
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:18,220
Peace.

1101
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:20,220
Who should I go?

1102
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:22,220
What did you say?

1103
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:24,220
Later.

1104
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:26,220
Should there be someone I choose for now?

1105
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:30,220
I'm letting my senpais

1106
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:32,220
backseat me right now.

1107
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:34,220
What did you say?

1108
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:38,220
I've changed my makeup.

1109
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:40,220
I've changed my makeup.

1110
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:42,220
What did you say?

1111
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:44,220
Destiny.

1112
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:46,220
Destiny.

1113
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:48,220
We'll use

1114
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:50,220
Mask.

1115
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:54,220
I just like

1116
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:56,220
teleported in.

1117
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:58,220
I

1118
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:02,220
have such bad posture.

1119
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:14,220
I

1120
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:28,220
What happened?

1121
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:30,220
Why did it scan?

1122
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:32,220
I'm so sorry.

1123
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:34,220
I don't understand why it didn't scan.

1124
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:36,220
I

1125
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:42,220
What the?

1126
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:44,220
Why didn't it scan?

1127
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:46,220
At that time.

1128
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,220
No, no, no.

1129
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:50,220
I pressed the...

1130
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:52,220
Maybe I didn't hold it down enough.

1131
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:54,220
That was my bad.

1132
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:58,220
What the hell?

1133
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:00,220
I

1134
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:04,220
Oh my gosh.

1135
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:26,220
I'm hitting back.

1136
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:28,220
I gotta use

1137
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:30,220
Mask

1138
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:32,220
this way.

1139
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:46,220
He's so slow.

1140
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,220
Wait, I can change right here?

1141
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:52,220
How do I change right here?

1142
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:58,220
I

1143
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,220
What button?

1144
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:10,220
Oh, I found it.

1145
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:28,220
Should I use consmith then?

1146
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:38,220
How do I heal from the screen?

1147
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:52,220
I have...

1148
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:54,220
Okay, there's some stuff.

1149
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:56,220
I have any items?

1150
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,220
Photos.

1151
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:00,220
Who the heck is this?

1152
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:02,220
You know, he kind of looks like

1153
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:04,220
what's his name? The gumshoe guy

1154
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:06,220
from Ace Attorney.

1155
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:16,220
I just...

1156
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:18,220
wall?

1157
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:20,220
wall?

1158
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:22,220
Blood?

1159
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,220
Oh.

1160
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:38,220
Okay, I understand.

1161
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:40,220
I guess I can try.

1162
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:42,220
Hi, Dave.

1163
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:44,220
Whoa! You didn't fucking kill him!

1164
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:46,220
You didn't fucking kill him?

1165
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:52,220
I feel like I just fucking killed him.

1166
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:58,220
Wait, did I just

1167
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:00,220
upskirt her? Hold on.

1168
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:02,220
If I'm going to use Kaede,

1169
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:04,220
I have to read about her.

1170
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:06,220
Hold on.

1171
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,220
Hold on.

1172
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:24,220
Oops.

1173
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:26,220
We're in a tight spot, yeah, yeah.

1174
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:28,220
Sorry, sorry about

1175
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:30,220
breaking Senpai's ears.

1176
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:32,220
I know, it rattles

1177
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:34,220
the cage a little.

1178
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:58,220
Okay.

1179
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:00,220
Sorry, I meant

1180
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:02,220
to go down to Kaede's

1181
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,220
in the night. I had

1182
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:06,220
my little quick thingies.

1183
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:08,220
Master!

1184
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:10,220
We're in a tight spot.

1185
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:12,220
The skill is extraordinary.

1186
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:14,220
Barefoot can call

1187
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:16,220
spirit Mizaru.

1188
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:18,220
You can break barriers.

1189
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:20,220
Allowing you to

1190
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:22,220
explore new areas.

1191
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:24,220
You can also

1192
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:26,220
explore new areas.

1193
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:30,220
Press the Y button to use it.

1194
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:32,220
In the name of her, Ma.

1195
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:36,220
Wait.

1196
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:56,220
Don't make me say it again.

1197
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:58,220
Wait here.

1198
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:00,220
I changed my makeup.

1199
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:02,220
What did you say?

1200
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:04,220
Coyote Smith.

1201
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:12,220
Are you super fast?

1202
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:14,220
Are you super slow?

1203
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:16,220
The skill is extraordinary.

1204
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:24,220
If you press 1, 3, 6,

1205
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:26,220
you can play a swaps personality.

1206
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,220
I'm using a controller.

1207
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:36,220
I'll check.

1208
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,220
I'll use it for now.

1209
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:57,420
Why is he holding it upside down?

1210
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:58,420
Not!

1211
01:57:58,420 --> 01:57:59,420
Not!

1212
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:00,420
Not!

1213
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:01,420
Not!

1214
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:02,720
Not!

1215
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:03,720
Not!

1216
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:04,720
Not!

1217
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:05,720
Not!

1218
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:06,220
Not!

1219
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:07,220
Not!

1220
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:25,020

Okay, she's back to normal, I can save now!

1242
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:33,540
Woo! Save, save, save, save, save!

1243
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:47,540
Oh hey, I didn't realize!

1244
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,540
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1245
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,540
We're gucci, probably.

1246
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:00,540
Ooh.

1247
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:02,540
Ooh.

1248
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:04,540
Can I unlock anyone else now?

1249
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:09,540
Don't make me say a cheese.

1250
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:11,540
I've changed my makeup.

1251
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:12,540
I've changed my-

1252
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:13,540
Cheese.

1253
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:14,540
I've changed-

1254
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:15,540
What did you say?

1255
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:16,540
Later.

1256
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:17,540
Destiny.

1257
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:24,540
Why is he bouncing like that?!

1258
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:30,540
Ooh.

1259
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:34,540
I guess I-

1260
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:37,540
How'd I turn my blood to the doctor?

1261
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:44,540
Oh!

1262
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:57,540
Is that all he's used for?

1263
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:02,540
How'd I level up?

1264
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,540
I have to go in the hallway for this?

1265
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:26,540
Ooh!

1266
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:29,540
Ooh.

1267
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:43,540
Okay, upgrade the TV.

1268
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:45,540
Okay, thank you, senpai!

1269
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:47,540
You're helping me so much!

1270
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:53,540
In exchange, I'll let you have five minutes of free time in the cage.

1271
02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:57,540
Don't make me say it again.

1272
02:04:57,540 --> 02:04:59,540
I'm a cleaner.

1273
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:01,540
Wait here.

1274
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:05,540
Power.

1275
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,540
Hmm.

1276
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:10,540
What should I put on for Dan?

1277
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:20,540
Hmm.

1278
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:29,540
Hmm.

1279
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:32,540
What's waiver?

1280
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:40,540
Waiver helps with aim?

1281
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:41,540
Okay.

1282
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:44,540
Maybe I'll put someone's aim since I'm bad at it!

1283
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:50,540
Waiver velvet from fate?

1284
02:05:58,540 --> 02:05:59,540
Hmm.

1285
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:08,540
Oh wait, what is the waiver from fate?

1286
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:15,540
I have enough for more, should I put in more?

1287
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:19,540
I've changed my makeup.

1288
02:06:20,540 --> 02:06:22,540
What did you say?

1289
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:24,540
Later.

1290
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:25,540
Pee.

1291
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:29,540
Destiny.

1292
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:31,540
Destiny.

1293
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:45,540
Spend as much as you want, you can farm easily, okay.

1294
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:50,540
Okay!

1295
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:54,540
Decisions, decisions.

1296
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:57,540
Don't make me say it again.

1297
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:59,540
I'm a cleaner.

1298
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:05,540
Does Garcian have no level up thingies?

1299
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:35,540
Yeah, whatever, we'll level Dan up a little, but I'm kind of used to him.

1300
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:49,540
Oh wait, I should probably save.

1301
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:50,540
I'm so silly.

1302
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:52,540
What a silly Billy I am.

1303
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:53,540
Save!

1304
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:58,540
Samantha, please be kind to me, I'm gonna save!

1305
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:25,540
Okay, health looks good.

1306
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:29,540
Uh, these stairs?

1307
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:36,540
An object.

1308
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:42,540
Grier?

1309
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:53,540
Eh?

1310
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:06,540
Well hello, Smith.

1311
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:09,540
Looks like a cloudy, cloudy day!

1312
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:11,540
What is really too bad, sad face?

1313
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:14,540
Uh, day to hang out in the laundry.

1314
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:16,540
Great day to use a dryer though.

1315
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:22,540
But you know, I just love this one.

1316
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:24,540
I'll never let anybody have it.

1317
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:25,540
You know why?

1318
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:27,540
Well you should.

1319
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:30,540
I love to stay inside.

1320
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:32,540
You left this behind, didn't you?

1321
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,540
I got it!

1322
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:39,540
I got it, I got the firing!

1323
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:45,540
If you finish your business, could you hurry up and leave?

1324
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:47,540
You're very much in the way.

1325
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:49,540
Assassins should have better manners.

1326
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:54,540
Okay, thank you.

1327
02:09:57,540 --> 02:10:00,540
And then I go here, items.

1328
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:03,540
Like that, right?

1329
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:05,540
Should I head back now?

1330
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:08,540
Should I head back now?

1331
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:14,540
Should I save?

1332
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:15,540
I'll save again.

1333
02:10:15,540 --> 02:10:18,540
Sorry, I'm saving all the time so I don't forget.

1334
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:39,540
Wait, should I turn the dryer back on for her?

1335
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:40,540
Maybe I should.

1336
02:10:40,540 --> 02:10:44,540
Oh my gosh, I'm such a rude, I'm such a rude friend.

1337
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:53,540
I forgot to turn it off!

1338
02:11:00,540 --> 02:11:02,540
Never mind, I'm leaving.

1339
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:09,540
Where the fuck did that come from?

1340
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:15,540
Whatever, luckily I saved.

1341
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:37,540
What the fuck?

1342
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:50,540
Hey, my bitches!

1343
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:07,540
What the fuck?

1344
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:22,540
Now what?

1345
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:32,540
What was that?

1346
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:37,540
What the fuck?

1347
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:45,540
What fell?

1348
02:12:46,540 --> 02:12:48,540
Where did it fall?

1349
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:09,540
Laundry, okay, we're heading back to the laundry.

1350
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:24,540
What is that?

1351
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:27,540
Odd engraving.

1352
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:34,540
Wait, now that I have this, should I backtrack to the candles?

1353
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:37,540
What the fuck?

1354
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:43,540
It's an odd engraving.

1355
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:46,540
Yeah, we should do the backtrack.

1356
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:48,540
Man, what a pain!

1357
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:08,540
Ha ha ha!

1358
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:32,540
What was that sound?

1359
02:14:36,540 --> 02:14:38,540
My map?

1360
02:14:38,540 --> 02:14:40,540
My map?

1361
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:07,540
I'm just gonna take the stairs.

1362
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:10,540
Ha ha ha!

1363
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:36,540
Okay, I didn't backtrack too far.

1364
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:38,540
Handle.

1365
02:15:38,540 --> 02:15:40,540
Air conditioning?

1366
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:44,540
Oh, come on.

1367
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:57,540
One, two, three, four, five.

1368
02:15:59,540 --> 02:16:01,540
Oh!

1369
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:08,540
What's air conditioner?

1370
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:30,540
Did I need it on or off?

1371
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:38,540
Oh.

1372
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:52,540
Oh!

1373
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:55,540
But I don't need it anymore, right?

1374
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:09,540
Ha ha ha!

1375
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,540
Wait, which way?

1376
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:29,540
Oh.

1377
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:41,540
He's still flipping you off, like a bitch.

1378
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:43,540
I mean, he should.

1379
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:46,540
I'm not that great of a person.

1380
02:17:46,540 --> 02:17:49,540
Go back, you forgot the puzzle piece.

1381
02:17:49,540 --> 02:17:51,540
Huh?

1382
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:17,540
Dogo?

1383
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:23,540
What shelf? The one in the room?

1384
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:30,540
Oh, wow!

1385
02:18:33,540 --> 02:18:35,540
Odd engraving.

1386
02:18:49,540 --> 02:18:51,540
Ha ha ha!

1387
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:10,540
Look at how much of a pro I am now.

1388
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:13,540
I improved so much, Senpai.

1389
02:19:20,540 --> 02:19:22,540
Oh.

1390
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:32,540
Oh, there's so many of you.

1391
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:52,540
Ah!

1392
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:07,540
Can I do this control panel?

1393
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:09,540
Oh!

1394
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:21,540
Oh!

1395
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:30,540
Sorry, your leg.

1396
02:20:35,540 --> 02:20:37,540
Man!

1397
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:47,540
That was kind of brutal.

1398
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:50,540
Warehouse.

1399
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:56,540
Oh?

1400
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:06,540
Oh my gosh!

1401
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:09,540
It was out of you, you scared me again!

1402
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:11,540
Master!

1403
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:13,540
We're in a tight spot.

1404
02:21:13,540 --> 02:21:15,540
Mask is for your disc-

1405
02:21:15,540 --> 02:21:17,540
Gizli rack.

1406
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:19,540
When there's a crack, it's his shul.

1407
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:21,540
He's filthy powerful.

1408
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:24,540
No destroy, all of kingdom come.

1409
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:26,540
And then some.

1410
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:30,540
He's a liability if you ask me.

1411
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:32,540
In the name of Harman.

1412
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:34,540
Oh!

1413
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:36,540
I get it.

1414
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:38,540
I get it.

1415
02:21:38,540 --> 02:21:42,540
I'm picking up while you're putting down game.

1416
02:21:43,540 --> 02:21:45,540
I change.

1417
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:47,540
Mask here.

1418
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:56,540
I get it.

1419
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:58,540
I'm so, yeah.

1420
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:01,540
Now what?

1421
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:03,540
I just...

1422
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:05,540
Wait, but like now what?

1423
02:22:13,540 --> 02:22:15,540
Oh!

1424
02:22:33,540 --> 02:22:36,540
What the hell is that?

1425
02:22:43,540 --> 02:22:45,540
Oh!

1426
02:22:52,540 --> 02:22:54,540
Carry a pigeon.

1427
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:01,540
Dear Amir.

1428
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:08,540
We have a problem.

1429
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:11,540
A terrible thing has happened. Pussy!

1430
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:15,540
My pigeon's name is Pussy!

1431
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:35,540
Pigeonosee?

1432
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:37,540
Pigeonosee?

1433
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:41,540
Who named this?

1434
02:23:41,540 --> 02:23:43,540
Anyways.

1435
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:46,540
Who named these pigeons?

1436
02:23:46,540 --> 02:23:49,540
Dear Amir. Amir, we have a problem.

1437
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:51,540
A terrible thing has happened.

1438
02:23:51,540 --> 02:23:53,540
I can hardly believe it.

1439
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:55,540
But the money is not in my account.

1440
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:57,540
What the fuck do you mean?

1441
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:11,540
I need your help. You got my last messages, didn't you?

1442
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:13,540
I trusted you.

1443
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:15,540
Now don't let me down. Promise me.

1444
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:17,540
Wire me the money immediately.

1445
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:20,540
125 bucks is peanuts, I'm telling you.

1446
02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:24,540
Smith's syndicate operates in strange ways.

1447
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:27,540
Garcia and Smith manages the other six personas

1448
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:31,540
and mainly acts as a negotiator for work requests.

1449
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:35,540
Garcia never eliminates people himself.

1450
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:37,540
His role is to retrieve the bodies.

1451
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:39,540
Even if another persona is killed,

1452
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:44,540
it appears he is able to bring him back to life

1453
02:24:44,540 --> 02:24:46,540
like a wizard, I tell you.

1454
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:49,540
However, it's my hunch that somebody offstage

1455
02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:52,540
is calling the shots and controlling Garcia.

1456
02:24:52,540 --> 02:24:55,540
There must be a hidden mastermind separate from the active team.

1457
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:59,540
And it's likely that this mastermind assigns the jobs.

1458
02:24:59,540 --> 02:25:03,540
Garcia is very loyal and he values the organization,

1459
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:06,540
controls the personas to keep the organization safe.

1460
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:09,540
He's a middle manager, you see.

1461
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:12,540
A member switch using the medium of television.

1462
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:16,540
I have yet to determine what governs the switches.

1463
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:22,540
Wizard, Shadow Money, Wizard, Shadow, Wizard Money Gang?

1464
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:28,540
Shadow, Shadow, Shadow, Shadow, Shadow Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang.

1465
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:35,540
We love casting spells and sh**.

1466
02:25:35,540 --> 02:25:52,540
The Smith Syndicate is composed of one sensible person and six freaks.

1467
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:56,540
I never seen the personas interact with each other.

1468
02:25:57,540 --> 02:25:59,540
Alright.

1469
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:05,540
Soon, I expect to unmask the myth behind the strange group.

1470
02:26:05,540 --> 02:26:09,540
I'll be contacting you again, Johnny Guy, Gangman.

1471
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:14,540
Tane, carry your memo.

1472
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:18,540
Hold on, let me switch to someone else.

1473
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:24,540
I like using Dan because he's kind of easier to use.

1474
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:28,540
Oh!

1475
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:45,540
Travis, what are you doing here?

1476
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:50,540
I was the chief's first catch.

1477
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:52,540
I can still remember.

1478
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:54,540
The chief's quivering hand.

1479
02:26:54,540 --> 02:26:58,540
The pain went straight up my spine and then back down again.

1480
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:00,540
Be honest, that should feel good.

1481
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:06,540
It all happened on the smothering hot night.

1482
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:12,540
Is that all you're gonna tell me, Travis?

1483
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:14,540
Is that all you're gonna tell me?

1484
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:17,540
Okay, I guess.

1485
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:25,540
Oh.

1486
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:49,540
Master, we're in a tight spot.

1487
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:51,540
Like, tighter than tight.

1488
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:52,540
Uh-oh.

1489
02:27:53,540 --> 02:27:54,540
Uh-oh?

1490
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:55,540
Real?

1491
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:59,540
Oh, I have offended my master with foul words,

1492
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:01,540
but please, you must understand.

1493
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:06,540
Just thinking about him drives me absolutely mad.

1494
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:09,540
He fixes the sink to sink this country,

1495
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:11,540
and so he's sending his unending blah-blah-blah

1496
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:13,540
with no sign of letting up.

1497
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:18,540
How many followers does he command?

1498
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:21,540
Beware of old friends.

1499
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:24,540
In the name of Harman.

1500
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:51,540
Can I save?

1501
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:52,540
Here.

1502
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:00,540
Here.

1503
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:02,540
Get my blood.

1504
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:05,540
Take my blood doctor.

1505
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:08,540
Blood doctor, blood doctor.

1506
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:11,540
Take all my blood doctor.

1507
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:14,540
Wait, I need the TV again, sorry.

1508
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:20,540
Don't make me say it again.

1509
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:21,540
I'm a cleaner.

1510
02:29:21,540 --> 02:29:23,540
Wait here.

1511
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:25,540
I'm gonna...

1512
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:28,540
improve my skills again.

1513
02:29:41,540 --> 02:29:42,540
Good enough.

1514
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:43,540
Okay.

1515
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:52,540
Now we get information here, right?

1516
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:14,540
Get away!

1517
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:16,540
What is this thing?

1518
02:30:18,540 --> 02:30:20,540
Why is it exploding?

1519
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:28,540
Why does it explode like that?

1520
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:46,540
This is too easy.

1521
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:47,540
What?

1522
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:09,540
What?

1523
02:31:09,540 --> 02:31:12,540
Master, we're in a tight spot.

1524
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:15,540
Watch out for barefoot.

1525
02:31:15,540 --> 02:31:16,540
Kaede.

1526
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:18,540
I've sensed this presence before.

1527
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:20,540
My ex-wife, Mizaru, was near.

1528
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:21,540
What?

1529
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:23,540
Is now the servant of barefoot.

1530
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:26,540
What?

1531
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:28,540
Let my wife serve you through barefoot.

1532
02:31:29,540 --> 02:31:31,540
Use the Y button for a death shower.

1533
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:33,540
In the name of Harman.

1534
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:35,540
What a what?

1535
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:43,540
What?

1536
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:54,540
This is too easy.

1537
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:13,540
What?

1538
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:27,540
Nice.

1539
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:39,540
Wait, I went the wrong way.

1540
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:41,540
I'm gonna go this way.

1541
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:44,540
Death shower, he said.

1542
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:48,540
What is death shower?

1543
02:32:55,540 --> 02:32:57,540
How'd I use her skill?

1544
02:32:58,540 --> 02:32:59,540
Gotta head out.

1545
02:32:59,540 --> 02:33:00,540
Good luck, Koi.

1546
02:33:00,540 --> 02:33:01,540
Goodbye!

1547
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:04,540
Sorry, I'm very not paying attention to chat,

1548
02:33:04,540 --> 02:33:06,540
because I'm confused.

1549
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:07,540
Confused.

1550
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:22,540
What is this?

1551
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:29,540
You don't need to aim for this one.

1552
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:30,540
Just hit Y.

1553
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:31,540
Oh.

1554
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:34,540
Oh!

1555
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:37,540
Oh!

1556
02:33:42,540 --> 02:33:43,540
Oh!

1557
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:47,540
Oh!

1558
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:54,540
Let's grab this bullet.

1559
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:05,540
Oh, I should probably change out.

1560
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:07,540
Oh!

1561
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:33,540
It's locked by padlock.

1562
02:34:36,540 --> 02:34:38,540
Guess I can't go there yet.

1563
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:02,540
Not bad, me.

1564
02:35:06,540 --> 02:35:08,540
Oh, sorry.

1565
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:15,540
I was like, oh my gosh!

1566
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:21,540
Oh my gosh!

1567
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:25,540
Hi, Travis.

1568
02:35:26,540 --> 02:35:27,540
Can you see it?

1569
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:29,540
No, I can't see it.

1570
02:35:29,540 --> 02:35:30,540
Oh, sorry.

1571
02:35:30,540 --> 02:35:32,540
I was like, oh my gosh!

1572
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:33,540
Hi, Travis.

1573
02:35:35,540 --> 02:35:36,540
Can you see it?

1574
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:38,540
Words written in blood.

1575
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:42,540
Obviously had a point to make.

1576
02:35:44,540 --> 02:35:47,540
But only two letters are written in real blood.

1577
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:49,540
Rest are fake.

1578
02:35:52,540 --> 02:35:54,540
You need the girl for this one.

1579
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:05,540
Does someone in my group pick locks?

1580
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:07,540
I didn't pay attention.

1581
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:09,540
I didn't pay attention.

1582
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:33,540
What the hell is she doing with her hands?

1583
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,540
Blood absorbed.

1584
02:36:37,540 --> 02:36:45,540
No, no what? No pussy? No head?

1585
02:37:08,540 --> 02:37:10,540
Well, I'll go back.

1586
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:21,540
If I have someone, I'll just use them.

1587
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:41,540
Oh!

1588
02:37:56,540 --> 02:38:00,540
Yay, blood! I think.

1589
02:38:07,540 --> 02:38:13,540
Travis? Huh? L.A.? Can't you see I'm busy?

1590
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:16,540
You ought to mind your manners.

1591
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:23,540
You guys are just a pack of losers.

1592
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:27,540
You don't even know how to make use of your abilities.

1593
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:32,540
There are traitors in heaven's smile.

1594
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:36,540
The chief's very own inside guys.

1595
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:41,540
They have a white body splattered with red paint.

1596
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:44,540
A reminder of treacherous speed.

1597
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:46,540
The girl!

1598
02:38:46,540 --> 02:38:49,540
Kite! Funny thing is the splotches look like beautiful red roses.

1599
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:53,540
If you find a chameleon smile, use your ability.

1600
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:58,540
Kill one of them and you'll get loaded up. For real, man.

1601
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:05,540
Oh.

1602
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:15,540
Important question. Are you having fun, Mercy? Yeah.

1603
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:18,540
Oops.

1604
02:39:24,540 --> 02:39:27,540
Oopsies.

1605
02:39:27,540 --> 02:39:31,540
I'm going to switch out characters because I'm not used to them yet.

1606
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:42,540
I'm getting tired. Kind of tired, though. Usually I have lots...

1607
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:45,540
What?

1608
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:56,540
Which way did I need to go again? I'm lost!

1609
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:05,540
Can I go here already?

1610
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:09,540
Oh, come on.

1611
02:40:21,540 --> 02:40:25,540
I got used to the game so now I feel more comfortable.

1612
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:29,540
Can I save here?

1613
02:40:29,540 --> 02:40:32,540
Okay.

1614
02:40:32,540 --> 02:40:36,540
I want to just save here, guys.

1615
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:43,540
And I'll probably end the gameplay here and I'll probably start yapping.

1616
02:40:49,540 --> 02:40:53,540
Probably start yapping.

1617
02:40:53,540 --> 02:40:57,540
That was a lot.

1618
02:40:57,540 --> 02:41:01,540
Ha ha ha ha!

1619
02:41:01,540 --> 02:41:06,540
Yeah, main outfit saves the day!

1620
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:09,540
Oh!

1621
02:41:19,540 --> 02:41:23,540
Now, how do I get out of here?

1622
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:29,540
Yes! Like this. I saved, right? I totally did.

1623
02:41:42,540 --> 02:41:45,540
Yatta!

1624
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:49,540
Right, let's go...

1625
02:41:49,540 --> 02:41:52,540
Over here.

1626
02:41:53,540 --> 02:41:56,540
Okay.

1627
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:59,540
How was it? How was it, Senpai? Did you like the game?

1628
02:41:59,540 --> 02:42:03,540
I finally... I think I got the hang of it.

1629
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:07,540
It took a little bit, but I got the hang of it.

1630
02:42:10,540 --> 02:42:14,540
I was really shocked when...

1631
02:42:14,540 --> 02:42:21,540
At the beginning, the beginning was... Oh, hold on. Let me just fix myself a little bit. Let me...

1632
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:27,540
Actually, maybe I kind of like myself looking like this, right?

1633
02:42:34,540 --> 02:42:41,540
There, I'm bright and beautiful again. You see me in all my glory.

1634
02:42:41,540 --> 02:42:44,540
Senpai!

1635
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:49,540
You did like the game, though, right? After I chose it for you!

1636
02:42:50,540 --> 02:42:54,540
It's like the lights turned on.

1637
02:42:58,540 --> 02:43:01,540
It was really tough, but I managed to figure it out.

1638
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:07,540
It only took up to now to actually fully get comfortable with the game.

1639
02:43:10,540 --> 02:43:14,540
It was pretty brutal, not going to lie to you.

1640
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:18,540
At the beginning, the game...

1641
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:21,540
I didn't get it.

1642
02:43:21,540 --> 02:43:28,540
That tutorial was pretty bad, and then I only got it when they gave me the info dump tutorial.

1643
02:43:28,540 --> 02:43:32,540
Then I was like, okay, I get it now, I get it now.

1644
02:43:35,540 --> 02:43:38,540
I'm on guard games are really fun, though.

1645
02:43:38,540 --> 02:43:43,540
I really like kind of experimental games, because I...

1646
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:49,540
I find that kind of like, weirder gameplay...

1647
02:43:49,540 --> 02:43:55,540
makes me more interested in like, what the story's going to tell.

1648
02:44:02,540 --> 02:44:06,540
It was really, it was really...

1649
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:09,540
The lore is even crazier, for real?

1650
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:12,540
Okay, I can't wait to try this game again.

1651
02:44:12,540 --> 02:44:16,540
It might be a little bit, but we'll definitely pick this up again.

1652
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:19,540
This entire week is booked up.

1653
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:25,540
It's booked up, so we're going to explore a variety of games together.

1654
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:29,540
Because...

1655
02:44:29,540 --> 02:44:36,540
Well, I just want to showcase each game that I play.

1656
02:44:36,540 --> 02:44:40,540
That I play for my supplies, where I strapped you...

1657
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:47,540
Strapped you into a chair, just like in Clockwork Orange.

1658
02:44:47,540 --> 02:44:52,540
What was it? The Ludo something technique?

1659
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:56,540
I forced your eyes open, and only...

1660
02:44:56,540 --> 02:45:02,540
And every once in a while, I put eye drops, so your eyes get moistered.

1661
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:06,540
Ludovico technique, yeah!

1662
02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:09,540
I'm so glad my supplies are so smart!

1663
02:45:09,540 --> 02:45:11,540
This is why I love you so much.

1664
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:20,540
Wow, my supplies are really smart!

1665
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:23,540
You memorize that.

1666
02:45:23,540 --> 02:45:27,540
I'm so proud. Good job.

1667
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:33,540
That movie was really fun.

1668
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:35,540
It was really fun.

1669
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:46,540
I'm hoping tomorrow... Let me check my schedule again.

1670
02:45:46,540 --> 02:45:51,540
I always forget what I scheduled.

1671
02:45:52,540 --> 02:45:56,540
Because I'm kind of clumsy.

1672
02:45:56,540 --> 02:46:03,540
My schedules are weeks in advance.

1673
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:08,540
So I choose my games weeks in advance.

1674
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:15,540
Let's see. Tomorrow is Omori.

1675
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:19,540
In truth, I played Omori before.

1676
02:46:19,540 --> 02:46:21,540
I don't remember much of it.

1677
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:27,540
I remember rage quitting, because I fought a bunch of bears.

1678
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:30,540
It was like fighting a bunch of ICs at once.

1679
02:46:30,540 --> 02:46:32,540
It was brutal.

1680
02:46:40,540 --> 02:46:44,540
So that's where...

1681
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:49,540
Imagine like 10 ICs coming at you.

1682
02:46:49,540 --> 02:46:51,540
Over and over and over and over again.

1683
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:53,540
It takes you out of breath.

1684
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:55,540
By the end of it, you're like,

1685
02:46:55,540 --> 02:46:57,540
Okay, I need to go heal up.

1686
02:46:57,540 --> 02:46:59,540
Then you come back.

1687
02:46:59,540 --> 02:47:04,540
They spawn back 10 more bears.

1688
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:07,540
10 more ICs, okay?

1689
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:13,540
So I rage quit at that part.

1690
02:47:13,540 --> 02:47:15,540
Now I learned my lesson.

1691
02:47:15,540 --> 02:47:18,540
I'm not going to do that this time.

1692
02:47:18,540 --> 02:47:21,540
Wait, Serenity's in chat?

1693
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:23,540
Serenity, Serenity, Serenity!

1694
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:25,540
My baby!

1695
02:47:25,540 --> 02:47:27,540
My baby bunny!

1696
02:47:27,540 --> 02:47:30,540
My bunny bunny, honey!

1697
02:47:30,540 --> 02:47:32,540
Honey!

1698
02:47:36,540 --> 02:47:38,540
I love you!

1699
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:39,540
The bear fight was rough.

1700
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:40,540
I found her.

1701
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:41,540
I found her. Yes, it was.

1702
02:47:41,540 --> 02:47:43,540
It was. I cried.

1703
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:49,540
I'm so happy you're here.

1704
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:53,540
I'm so happy you're here.

1705
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:56,540
Oh, you're kind of up late.

1706
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:04,540
I'm watching in bed. Have good sleeps then.

1707
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:07,540
Have good sleeps then.

1708
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:12,540
Tucks you in. Kisses you goodnight.

1709
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:25,540
I'm so happy though.

1710
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:28,540
Oh, I'm so, so happy.

1711
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:30,540
Thank you Serenity for dropping by.

1712
02:48:30,540 --> 02:48:32,540
I love seeing you here all the time.

1713
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:33,540
Thank you.

1714
02:48:33,540 --> 02:48:35,540
I'm sure my supplies love you too.

1715
02:48:35,540 --> 02:48:38,540
But yeah, don't try to steal my supplies away from me.

1716
02:48:38,540 --> 02:48:40,540
I will kill you.

1717
02:48:55,540 --> 02:48:57,540
Yeah, yeah!

1718
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:59,540
Oh my gosh, I love you.

1719
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:06,540
Yes, Senpai's got five minutes free time and out of the cage

1720
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:08,540
until they go back again.

1721
02:49:12,540 --> 02:49:16,540
Serenity gets a basement visit permit or is she a resident?

1722
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:26,540
Well, like she gets special privileges.

1723
02:49:26,540 --> 02:49:30,540
So like she's stuck in the basement, but she gets to go in and out freely.

1724
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:32,540
Because I trust her.

1725
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:40,540
Is our cage bedroom size?

1726
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:42,540
It's dog cage size.

1727
02:49:47,540 --> 02:49:49,540
It's dog cage size.

1728
02:49:49,540 --> 02:49:54,540
It's a little, it's a little um, a little cozy in there.

1729
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:58,540
I put some star glow in the dark star stickers

1730
02:49:58,540 --> 02:50:03,540
or for my senpais to feel like they're looking up at the night sky.

1731
02:50:06,540 --> 02:50:08,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1732
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:10,540
My senpais get a little doggy bed.

1733
02:50:10,540 --> 02:50:12,540
The plaid ones.

1734
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:15,540
If you're, if you really get, if you're really feeling special.

1735
02:50:15,540 --> 02:50:20,540
Some, some days you get the velour one, the velour doggy bed.

1736
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:27,540
With the little pillow and the stuffed animal.

1737
02:50:27,540 --> 02:50:29,540
That's every Fridays.

1738
02:50:29,540 --> 02:50:31,540
That's a treat.

1739
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:52,540
As a treat. Yeah.

1740
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:56,540
I'm so generous.

1741
02:50:56,540 --> 02:51:00,540
I know I treat, I'm, I'm such a good girlfriend.

1742
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:06,540
I'm so happy though.

1743
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:10,540
I'm such a good girlfriend.

1744
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:13,540
I let you have all these wonderful treats.

1745
02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:16,540
In fact, I might give you a treat later.

1746
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:23,540
Yeah.

1747
02:51:26,540 --> 02:51:28,540
Can we get McDonald's?

1748
02:51:31,540 --> 02:51:33,540
Everyone gets a happy meal.

1749
02:51:33,540 --> 02:51:35,540
Once a month.

1750
02:51:44,540 --> 02:51:45,540
The basement.

1751
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:47,540
Everyone gets a happy meal.

1752
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:48,540
Once a month.

1753
02:51:48,540 --> 02:51:50,540
You get a little toy to play with.

1754
02:51:52,540 --> 02:51:53,540
Can I have new clothes?

1755
02:51:53,540 --> 02:51:54,540
No.

1756
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:01,540
Is that a little unhealthy at the McDonald's?

1757
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:03,540
Well, it is a treat.

1758
02:52:03,540 --> 02:52:05,540
That's why it's a treat only once a month.

1759
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:10,540
Yeah, everyone shares.

1760
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:12,540
You got, everyone has to share.

1761
02:52:12,540 --> 02:52:13,540
Okay.

1762
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:17,540
Everyone gets one little, little, little, little taste of the yogurt.

1763
02:52:18,540 --> 02:52:24,540
Everyone gets a tiny, tiny crumb of, of the fries.

1764
02:52:26,540 --> 02:52:31,540
And then have a little, little, little fight over the nuggets.

1765
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:42,540
And the toy is shared amongst everyone.

1766
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:43,540
Of course.

1767
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,540
Can we not fight over it?

1768
02:52:53,540 --> 02:52:56,540
Well, if you, you're all good and willing to share,

1769
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:58,540
you don't have to fight over it.

1770
02:52:59,540 --> 02:53:01,540
After all, it's a democracy here.

1771
02:53:14,540 --> 02:53:16,540
Kai won't be our toy?

1772
02:53:16,540 --> 02:53:17,540
Of course not.

1773
02:53:17,540 --> 02:53:19,540
You're my toy Senpai.

1774
02:53:36,540 --> 02:53:38,540
Can we vote for more time?

1775
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:39,540
Yeah.

1776
02:53:39,540 --> 02:53:41,540
Democracy where, um,

1777
02:53:42,540 --> 02:53:46,540
Mercy's, Mercy's vote is worth 10 times more

1778
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:49,540
than everyone else's combined.

1779
02:54:00,540 --> 02:54:02,540
I vote for last free time.

1780
02:54:02,540 --> 02:54:03,540
Oh.

1781
02:54:04,540 --> 02:54:05,540
Okay.

1782
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:07,540
So last free time, that means you,

1783
02:54:07,540 --> 02:54:09,540
I can assign homework now.

1784
02:54:12,540 --> 02:54:13,540
Okay.

1785
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:32,540
I can give Senpai's homework.

1786
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:34,540
It's really easy.

1787
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:35,540
It's really easy homework.

1788
02:54:35,540 --> 02:54:36,540
You'll love it.

1789
02:54:36,540 --> 02:54:38,540
You'll love it.

1790
02:54:38,540 --> 02:54:42,540
Watch every single episode of Cardcaptor Sakura.

1791
02:54:51,540 --> 02:54:54,540
Watch every single episode of Cardcaptor Sakura.

1792
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:57,540
Come back with me with a thousand word,

1793
02:54:57,540 --> 02:55:01,540
a little essay about how you felt about it.

1794
02:55:02,540 --> 02:55:04,540
And then,

1795
02:55:04,540 --> 02:55:06,540
mostly your thousand word essay

1796
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:09,540
must consist of why Sakura is the best

1797
02:55:12,540 --> 02:55:14,540
of about the movies.

1798
02:55:14,540 --> 02:55:15,540
They count.

1799
02:55:15,540 --> 02:55:17,540
It's just one long episode.

1800
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:25,540
1,200 words?

1801
02:55:25,540 --> 02:55:28,540
Oh, you get bonus points then.

1802
02:55:28,540 --> 02:55:30,540
Your bonus point will be a little,

1803
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:32,540
a little smooch.

1804
02:55:32,540 --> 02:55:34,540
A little smooch on your homework.

1805
02:55:38,540 --> 02:55:40,540
Can it be a group project instead?

1806
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:41,540
No.

1807
02:55:44,540 --> 02:55:46,540
I can't call Sakura the best because you're the best.

1808
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:48,540
Of course I'm the best.

1809
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:50,540
But at the same time, we must,

1810
02:55:50,540 --> 02:55:52,540
if it wasn't for Sakura,

1811
02:55:52,540 --> 02:55:54,540
I wouldn't even be here.

1812
02:55:54,540 --> 02:55:56,540
Sakura actually,

1813
02:55:56,540 --> 02:55:58,540
got me through hard times.

1814
02:56:08,540 --> 02:56:10,540
The original, right?

1815
02:56:10,540 --> 02:56:13,540
Or will you do the Nirvana butchered version too?

1816
02:56:13,540 --> 02:56:14,540
Both.

1817
02:56:16,540 --> 02:56:17,540
Both.

1818
02:56:17,540 --> 02:56:20,540
When I said all episodes, I meant it in every single language.

1819
02:56:27,540 --> 02:56:28,540
Hahaha.

1820
02:56:33,540 --> 02:56:34,540
Instructions unclear.

1821
02:56:34,540 --> 02:56:35,540
Binge Chobits.

1822
02:56:35,540 --> 02:56:37,540
Oh, speaking of Chobits,

1823
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:39,540
I just remember,

1824
02:56:39,540 --> 02:56:42,540
when I was a child,

1825
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:44,540
I loved Chobits.

1826
02:56:44,540 --> 02:56:46,540
And I,

1827
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:49,540
had no idea what Chobits was about.

1828
02:56:49,540 --> 02:56:51,540
So when you know,

1829
02:56:51,540 --> 02:56:53,540
little old,

1830
02:56:53,540 --> 02:56:55,540
baby Mercy went,

1831
02:56:55,540 --> 02:56:58,540
why is it such a big deal that,

1832
02:56:58,540 --> 02:56:59,540
there's a button there?

1833
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:00,540
Of course there's a button there.

1834
02:57:00,540 --> 02:57:02,540
That's the last place I didn't look.

1835
02:57:05,540 --> 02:57:07,540
I had no idea.

1836
02:57:12,540 --> 02:57:14,540
I had no idea.

1837
02:57:14,540 --> 02:57:15,540
Every time,

1838
02:57:15,540 --> 02:57:16,540
the entire time,

1839
02:57:16,540 --> 02:57:17,540
I was like, wow,

1840
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:18,540
she is so cute.

1841
02:57:18,540 --> 02:57:20,540
I hope she's so happy with Hideki.

1842
02:57:21,540 --> 02:57:24,540
And then I watched it,

1843
02:57:24,540 --> 02:57:26,540
re-watched it again,

1844
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:27,540
and I was like,

1845
02:57:27,540 --> 02:57:29,540
I shouldn't have watched this.

1846
02:57:29,540 --> 02:57:31,540
Why did I watch this?

1847
02:57:31,540 --> 02:57:32,540
I shouldn't have watched this

1848
02:57:32,540 --> 02:57:34,540
when I was a wee little lass.

1849
02:57:40,540 --> 02:57:41,540
I was,

1850
02:57:41,540 --> 02:57:43,540
yeah,

1851
02:57:43,540 --> 02:57:45,540
I didn't tell this one,

1852
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:48,540
but I don't think it's a really cringe story,

1853
02:57:48,540 --> 02:57:49,540
but,

1854
02:57:49,540 --> 02:57:50,540
I guess there's a lot of things

1855
02:57:50,540 --> 02:57:51,540
when I didn't,

1856
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:53,540
I was very ignorant of,

1857
02:57:53,540 --> 02:57:55,540
more so than now.

1858
02:57:57,540 --> 02:57:58,540
For example,

1859
02:57:58,540 --> 02:58:01,540
I used to call every single person,

1860
02:58:01,540 --> 02:58:03,540
who was like,

1861
02:58:03,540 --> 02:58:06,540
a female caretaker of me,

1862
02:58:06,540 --> 02:58:07,540
for example, like,

1863
02:58:07,540 --> 02:58:09,540
a mommy, right?

1864
02:58:09,540 --> 02:58:11,540
So I would call my teacher's mommy,

1865
02:58:11,540 --> 02:58:12,540
I would call,

1866
02:58:14,540 --> 02:58:16,540
I would call my friends,

1867
02:58:16,540 --> 02:58:18,540
my friends,

1868
02:58:18,540 --> 02:58:20,540
mom, mommy as well,

1869
02:58:20,540 --> 02:58:22,540
because I thought,

1870
02:58:22,540 --> 02:58:23,540
because I read in a book,

1871
02:58:23,540 --> 02:58:24,540
it says like,

1872
02:58:24,540 --> 02:58:26,540
oh, what is a mommy?

1873
02:58:26,540 --> 02:58:27,540
What is a mother?

1874
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:28,540
A mommy is,

1875
02:58:28,540 --> 02:58:31,540
is someone who takes care of you.

1876
02:58:31,540 --> 02:58:32,540
So I just associated it

1877
02:58:32,540 --> 02:58:33,540
for a long time,

1878
02:58:33,540 --> 02:58:35,540
with just like,

1879
02:58:35,540 --> 02:58:38,540
just like any woman who took care of me.

1880
02:58:41,540 --> 02:58:42,540
And then I think,

1881
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:44,540
I only found out when I got like,

1882
02:58:44,540 --> 02:58:45,540
really,

1883
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:46,540
I got lectured about it,

1884
02:58:46,540 --> 02:58:47,540
by a teacher who did not,

1885
02:58:47,540 --> 02:58:49,540
like being called mommy.

1886
02:58:56,540 --> 02:58:57,540
He called friends,

1887
02:58:57,540 --> 02:58:59,540
now I called my friends,

1888
02:58:59,540 --> 02:59:00,540
mom,

1889
02:59:00,540 --> 02:59:01,540
this as well,

1890
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:02,540
so I would call mommy,

1891
02:59:02,540 --> 02:59:04,540
their mommy, mommy.

1892
02:59:05,540 --> 02:59:07,540
Oh my gosh, Strony!

1893
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:11,540
Strony calls.

1894
02:59:12,540 --> 02:59:14,540
Welcome,

1895
02:59:14,540 --> 02:59:15,540
mommy!

1896
02:59:17,540 --> 02:59:18,540
Mommy!

1897
02:59:20,540 --> 02:59:22,540
Speaking of mommies,

1898
02:59:22,540 --> 02:59:24,540
mommies here, everybody,

1899
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:27,540
everyone bow your head in respect,

1900
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:28,540
every Senpai,

1901
02:59:28,540 --> 02:59:30,540
bow your head in respect.

1902
02:59:33,540 --> 02:59:35,540
Are you doing it Senpai?

1903
02:59:35,540 --> 02:59:36,540
Good,

1904
02:59:36,540 --> 02:59:37,540
mommy is off to brush her teeth,

1905
02:59:37,540 --> 02:59:38,540
and go to sleep.

1906
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:39,540
Good, good, good,

1907
02:59:39,540 --> 02:59:41,540
make sure to floss as well.

1908
02:59:42,540 --> 02:59:43,540
Welcome everyone,

1909
02:59:43,540 --> 02:59:45,540
welcome to the stream,

1910
02:59:45,540 --> 02:59:47,540
I just finished,

1911
02:59:47,540 --> 02:59:49,540
not finished, but I,

1912
02:59:50,540 --> 02:59:51,540
I just,

1913
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:53,540
temporarily,

1914
02:59:53,540 --> 02:59:54,540
put on hold,

1915
02:59:54,540 --> 02:59:56,540
my playthrough of

1916
02:59:56,540 --> 02:59:57,540
Killer Seven,

1917
02:59:58,540 --> 02:59:59,540
in order to yap.

1918
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:02,540
Have fun Mercy,

1919
03:00:02,540 --> 03:00:03,540
love you,

1920
03:00:03,540 --> 03:00:04,540
love you too,

1921
03:00:04,540 --> 03:00:05,540
mommy!

1922
03:00:05,540 --> 03:00:06,540
I love you!

1923
03:00:12,540 --> 03:00:13,540
Of course,

1924
03:00:13,540 --> 03:00:14,540
Strony has like,

1925
03:00:14,540 --> 03:00:15,540
super strong endurance.

1926
03:00:15,540 --> 03:00:16,540
I,

1927
03:00:17,540 --> 03:00:19,540
am still getting used to my schedule,

1928
03:00:19,540 --> 03:00:21,540
so my endurance is not as,

1929
03:00:21,540 --> 03:00:22,540
as good.

1930
03:00:22,540 --> 03:00:23,540
My endurance,

1931
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:25,540
maximum for me,

1932
03:00:25,540 --> 03:00:26,540
I can do,

1933
03:00:26,540 --> 03:00:29,540
if I'm really enthralled by a game,

1934
03:00:29,540 --> 03:00:30,540
is,

1935
03:00:31,540 --> 03:00:33,540
the max I did was,

1936
03:00:33,540 --> 03:00:35,540
I think I did 12 hours with the max,

1937
03:00:35,540 --> 03:00:36,540
and then,

1938
03:00:36,540 --> 03:00:37,540
like,

1939
03:00:37,540 --> 03:00:38,540
after that I was like,

1940
03:00:38,540 --> 03:00:39,540
I'm never doing that again,

1941
03:00:39,540 --> 03:00:40,540
so my max,

1942
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:41,540
absolute limit,

1943
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:43,540
is probably 8 hours.

1944
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:46,540
Probably 8 hours.

1945
03:00:47,540 --> 03:00:48,540
Killer Seven,

1946
03:00:48,540 --> 03:00:49,540
good taste,

1947
03:00:49,540 --> 03:00:50,540
thank you,

1948
03:00:50,540 --> 03:00:51,540
actually,

1949
03:00:51,540 --> 03:00:52,540
I thought I played Killer Seven,

1950
03:00:52,540 --> 03:00:53,540
I was like,

1951
03:00:53,540 --> 03:00:54,540
yeah, I played Killer Seven,

1952
03:00:54,540 --> 03:00:55,540
like,

1953
03:00:55,540 --> 03:00:56,540
that's not a 51 game,

1954
03:00:56,540 --> 03:00:57,540
right?

1955
03:00:57,540 --> 03:00:58,540
Yeah, I played it before,

1956
03:00:58,540 --> 03:00:59,540
turns out I played,

1957
03:00:59,540 --> 03:01:00,540
Killer is dead,

1958
03:01:00,540 --> 03:01:01,540
and that's a completely different game,

1959
03:01:01,540 --> 03:01:02,540
so, oops.

1960
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:03,540
Hahaha.

1961
03:01:08,540 --> 03:01:11,540
What's the normal gaming session length for you?

1962
03:01:11,540 --> 03:01:12,540
Mmm,

1963
03:01:12,540 --> 03:01:14,540
I'd say about,

1964
03:01:14,540 --> 03:01:15,540
2 to 3 hours.

1965
03:01:16,540 --> 03:01:18,540
That's normally what normal is,

1966
03:01:18,540 --> 03:01:20,540
unless I'm super enthralled by it,

1967
03:01:20,540 --> 03:01:21,540
but, um,

1968
03:01:21,540 --> 03:01:23,540
since I,

1969
03:01:23,540 --> 03:01:25,540
get a little,

1970
03:01:25,540 --> 03:01:27,540
I'm a little bit,

1971
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:30,540
not used to the schedule yet,

1972
03:01:30,540 --> 03:01:33,540
and not used to my new routine yet,

1973
03:01:33,540 --> 03:01:34,540
I'm,

1974
03:01:34,540 --> 03:01:36,540
I'm forcing myself to stop,

1975
03:01:36,540 --> 03:01:38,540
within like,

1976
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:40,540
max 4 hours.

1977
03:01:40,540 --> 03:01:41,540
Hahaha.

1978
03:01:43,540 --> 03:01:45,540
Mostly because,

1979
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:46,540
um,

1980
03:01:48,540 --> 03:01:49,540
I have things to do,

1981
03:01:49,540 --> 03:01:50,540
and I want to prepare

1982
03:01:50,540 --> 03:01:51,540
a lot of things for Senpai.

1983
03:01:54,540 --> 03:01:56,540
So I want to be in the best condition for Senpai,

1984
03:01:56,540 --> 03:01:57,540
because after like,

1985
03:01:57,540 --> 03:01:59,540
maybe the 2 hour mark,

1986
03:01:59,540 --> 03:02:00,540
it's kind of,

1987
03:02:00,540 --> 03:02:01,540
it's down,

1988
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:03,540
it's downhill from there,

1989
03:02:03,540 --> 03:02:04,540
it's just like,

1990
03:02:04,540 --> 03:02:05,540
oh my god.

1991
03:02:05,540 --> 03:02:07,540
It's zombie mode,

1992
03:02:07,540 --> 03:02:08,540
or flow mode,

1993
03:02:08,540 --> 03:02:09,540
flow state,

1994
03:02:09,540 --> 03:02:11,540
where I'm not even interacting with chat,

1995
03:02:11,540 --> 03:02:12,540
or,

1996
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:13,540
you just hear me scream a lot.

1997
03:02:20,540 --> 03:02:21,540
You did pick the,

1998
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:22,540
pick the game,

1999
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:23,540
pick up the game,

2000
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:24,540
surprisingly fast.

2001
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:25,540
Well, really?

2002
03:02:25,540 --> 03:02:26,540
Is that,

2003
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:27,540
surprisingly fast?

2004
03:02:27,540 --> 03:02:28,540
I just read.

2005
03:02:28,540 --> 03:02:29,540
I read the instructions,

2006
03:02:29,540 --> 03:02:30,540
I'm like,

2007
03:02:30,540 --> 03:02:31,540
oh god,

2008
03:02:31,540 --> 03:02:32,540
oh god.

2009
03:02:39,540 --> 03:02:41,540
I called that disconnect progression.

2010
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:42,540
Oh,

2011
03:02:42,540 --> 03:02:43,540
that's a good name for it.

2012
03:02:43,540 --> 03:02:44,540
Thank you,

2013
03:02:44,540 --> 03:02:45,540
Senpai.

2014
03:02:46,540 --> 03:02:47,540
So,

2015
03:02:47,540 --> 03:02:48,540
that's why I was like,

2016
03:02:48,540 --> 03:02:49,540
oh,

2017
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:50,540
I should probably stop now,

2018
03:02:50,540 --> 03:02:52,540
especially since I'm getting a little bit tired

2019
03:02:52,540 --> 03:02:53,540
and fatigued.

2020
03:02:53,540 --> 03:02:54,540
I think

2021
03:02:54,540 --> 03:02:55,540
part of it is due,

2022
03:02:55,540 --> 03:02:56,540
is due to,

2023
03:02:57,540 --> 03:02:58,540
the motion sickness,

2024
03:02:59,540 --> 03:03:00,540
the,

2025
03:03:00,540 --> 03:03:02,540
probably the medication wearing off as well.

2026
03:03:02,540 --> 03:03:04,540
I did take nausea,

2027
03:03:04,540 --> 03:03:05,540
nausea,

2028
03:03:06,540 --> 03:03:07,540
meds,

2029
03:03:07,540 --> 03:03:08,540
because,

2030
03:03:09,540 --> 03:03:11,540
I am training myself a bit

2031
03:03:11,540 --> 03:03:13,540
with Killer Seven to,

2032
03:03:14,540 --> 03:03:15,540
to,

2033
03:03:16,540 --> 03:03:17,540
get used

2034
03:03:18,540 --> 03:03:19,540
to,

2035
03:03:19,540 --> 03:03:20,540
to motion.

2036
03:03:22,540 --> 03:03:23,540
So,

2037
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:24,540
some of those are,

2038
03:03:24,540 --> 03:03:26,540
it's probably because,

2039
03:03:26,540 --> 03:03:28,540
it's probably I'm,

2040
03:03:28,540 --> 03:03:29,540
because of that.

2041
03:03:29,540 --> 03:03:31,540
That's my theory.

2042
03:03:31,540 --> 03:03:32,540
And that's,

2043
03:03:32,540 --> 03:03:33,540
just a game.

2044
03:03:38,540 --> 03:03:39,540
So yeah, I was,

2045
03:03:39,540 --> 03:03:40,540
I thought to myself like,

2046
03:03:40,540 --> 03:03:41,540
oh, well,

2047
03:03:41,540 --> 03:03:42,540
I'll just use,

2048
03:03:42,540 --> 03:03:43,540
Killer Seven,

2049
03:03:43,540 --> 03:03:46,540
and I'll probably try other games too.

2050
03:03:46,540 --> 03:03:47,540
Like,

2051
03:03:47,540 --> 03:03:48,540
maybe GoldenEye,

2052
03:03:48,540 --> 03:03:49,540
to,

2053
03:03:49,540 --> 03:03:50,540
to train myself to,

2054
03:03:50,540 --> 03:03:52,540
to get used to,

2055
03:03:53,540 --> 03:03:54,540
first person stuff.

2056
03:03:56,540 --> 03:03:58,540
Do you feel less nervous tomorrow?

2057
03:04:00,540 --> 03:04:01,540
No.

2058
03:04:01,540 --> 03:04:02,540
Probably this entire week,

2059
03:04:02,540 --> 03:04:03,540
I'm going to be a little bit of a,

2060
03:04:03,540 --> 03:04:04,540
of a nerve ball.

2061
03:04:07,540 --> 03:04:08,540
I'm going to probably be,

2062
03:04:08,540 --> 03:04:09,540
a bit of a nerve ball,

2063
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:10,540
the entire,

2064
03:04:11,540 --> 03:04:12,540
the entire time.

2065
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:15,540
I might not show it out,

2066
03:04:15,540 --> 03:04:16,540
but inside,

2067
03:04:16,540 --> 03:04:17,540
I'm definitely like,

2068
03:04:18,540 --> 03:04:19,540
I have so many,

2069
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:21,540
I have so many senpais now,

2070
03:04:21,540 --> 03:04:22,540
what do I do?

2071
03:04:26,540 --> 03:04:27,540
But I definitely want to,

2072
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:28,540
to play games.

2073
03:04:28,540 --> 03:04:30,540
I'm actually looking forward,

2074
03:04:30,540 --> 03:04:33,540
I think the game that I'm looking forward to the most,

2075
03:04:33,540 --> 03:04:34,540
this week,

2076
03:04:35,540 --> 03:04:36,540
is,

2077
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:39,540
is Harvester.

2078
03:04:40,540 --> 03:04:42,540
Because I love point and click games.

2079
03:04:43,540 --> 03:04:45,540
I love point and click games.

2080
03:04:49,540 --> 03:04:51,540
Point and click games really,

2081
03:04:51,540 --> 03:04:52,540
really make me happy.

2082
03:04:54,540 --> 03:04:55,540
I'll tell you,

2083
03:04:55,540 --> 03:04:56,540
I'll tell you all a secret, okay?

2084
03:04:56,540 --> 03:04:57,540
Strawny says,

2085
03:04:57,540 --> 03:04:59,540
I should, I should,

2086
03:04:59,540 --> 03:05:00,540
Strawny said,

2087
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:01,540
I should,

2088
03:05:03,540 --> 03:05:05,540
play more games than point and clicks.

2089
03:05:14,540 --> 03:05:16,540
Do you like transgressive point and click games?

2090
03:05:16,540 --> 03:05:18,540
What do you mean by that?

2091
03:05:20,540 --> 03:05:23,540
Have you tried tell tales in The Walking Dead?

2092
03:05:23,540 --> 03:05:24,540
Not really.

2093
03:05:25,540 --> 03:05:28,540
I've tried the wolf among us.

2094
03:05:31,540 --> 03:05:33,540
Wolf, the wolf one,

2095
03:05:33,540 --> 03:05:35,540
I can't remember what it's really called.

2096
03:05:44,540 --> 03:05:45,540
No, not,

2097
03:05:45,540 --> 03:05:46,540
not among us, right?

2098
03:05:46,540 --> 03:05:47,540
Anyway,

2099
03:05:47,540 --> 03:05:49,540
wasn't among us?

2100
03:05:53,540 --> 03:05:54,540
Wait, what?

2101
03:05:55,540 --> 03:05:57,540
Was it, is it not called that?

2102
03:05:59,540 --> 03:06:00,540
It is called wolf among us.

2103
03:06:00,540 --> 03:06:01,540
Oh my gosh.

2104
03:06:01,540 --> 03:06:02,540
Oh, brain rot.

2105
03:06:02,540 --> 03:06:03,540
I was like, oh, shh.

2106
03:06:08,540 --> 03:06:09,540
Wow.

2107
03:06:11,540 --> 03:06:12,540
Brain rot,

2108
03:06:12,540 --> 03:06:14,540
every time I say among us,

2109
03:06:14,540 --> 03:06:15,540
among us.

2110
03:06:18,540 --> 03:06:19,540
I don't like,

2111
03:06:20,540 --> 03:06:21,540
I don't like

2112
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:25,540
quick time events.

2113
03:06:25,540 --> 03:06:27,540
That's why I didn't really like that game,

2114
03:06:27,540 --> 03:06:28,540
because I didn't like,

2115
03:06:32,540 --> 03:06:33,540
I didn't like

2116
03:06:34,540 --> 03:06:35,540
quick time events.

2117
03:06:37,540 --> 03:06:39,540
I'm still getting used to,

2118
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:42,540
getting used to different formats of things,

2119
03:06:42,540 --> 03:06:44,540
because when I do quick time events,

2120
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:45,540
I have to look down

2121
03:06:45,540 --> 03:06:47,540
because I'm like, what is the button?

2122
03:06:47,540 --> 03:06:49,540
I don't remember which button it is.

2123
03:06:51,540 --> 03:06:53,540
What point click titles are under your belt already?

2124
03:06:53,540 --> 03:06:54,540
Any classics?

2125
03:07:06,540 --> 03:07:08,540
Let me sort out my games.

2126
03:07:09,540 --> 03:07:11,540
Let me sort out my games some pie.

2127
03:07:16,540 --> 03:07:17,540
Oh my gosh,

2128
03:07:17,540 --> 03:07:20,540
how many games do I have in this collection?

2129
03:07:27,540 --> 03:07:31,540
I have 118 point and click games

2130
03:07:31,540 --> 03:07:33,540
on my Steam library.

2131
03:07:36,540 --> 03:07:38,540
Most of it I've already played.

2132
03:07:39,540 --> 03:07:40,540
Let's see.

2133
03:07:46,540 --> 03:07:47,540
I play

2134
03:07:51,540 --> 03:07:52,540
a lot.

2135
03:07:54,540 --> 03:07:55,540
A lot of them.

2136
03:07:56,540 --> 03:07:58,540
Wait, some of these aren't point and clicks.

2137
03:07:59,540 --> 03:08:00,540
Never mind.

2138
03:08:01,540 --> 03:08:03,540
Good chunk of them are, though.

2139
03:08:04,540 --> 03:08:06,540
The last one I played point and click,

2140
03:08:06,540 --> 03:08:07,540
I think,

2141
03:08:08,540 --> 03:08:10,540
was Gabriel Knight.

2142
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:13,540
Both,

2143
03:08:14,540 --> 03:08:15,540
Gabriel Knight.

2144
03:08:17,540 --> 03:08:19,540
Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel Knight.

2145
03:08:19,540 --> 03:08:20,540
Which one did I play?

2146
03:08:24,540 --> 03:08:25,540
The first one,

2147
03:08:26,540 --> 03:08:28,540
and then Sins of the Father.

2148
03:08:30,540 --> 03:08:31,540
And then

2149
03:08:35,540 --> 03:08:37,540
then I played almost all of them,

2150
03:08:37,540 --> 03:08:38,540
all of the ones,

2151
03:08:38,540 --> 03:08:41,540
almost all of the ones from Watch It Eye.

2152
03:08:44,540 --> 03:08:45,540
Uh...

2153
03:08:51,540 --> 03:08:52,540
Oh yeah, I remember.

2154
03:08:52,540 --> 03:08:54,540
Another one I really loved.

2155
03:08:54,540 --> 03:08:55,540
One that I really liked

2156
03:08:55,540 --> 03:08:57,540
that I thought was really good

2157
03:08:57,540 --> 03:08:59,540
was the Titanic point and click

2158
03:08:59,540 --> 03:09:00,540
adventure out of time.

2159
03:09:00,540 --> 03:09:01,540
That one was really fun.

2160
03:09:03,540 --> 03:09:04,540
What else do I have?

2161
03:09:04,540 --> 03:09:05,540
Tango Tower.

2162
03:09:09,540 --> 03:09:11,540
Oh wait, no, the last one I played

2163
03:09:11,540 --> 03:09:13,540
was not, no, wait, it was Gabriel Knight.

2164
03:09:13,540 --> 03:09:14,540
Sorry.

2165
03:09:14,540 --> 03:09:15,540
Things are, the one before that

2166
03:09:15,540 --> 03:09:17,540
I played was Sanitarium.

2167
03:09:19,540 --> 03:09:20,540
Was Sanitarium.

2168
03:09:21,540 --> 03:09:22,540
And then the one before that

2169
03:09:22,540 --> 03:09:24,540
I think was Salmon Max hit the road.

2170
03:09:32,540 --> 03:09:34,540
And then I played,

2171
03:09:34,540 --> 03:09:35,540
I played a lot.

2172
03:09:35,540 --> 03:09:36,540
I played a lot.

2173
03:09:39,540 --> 03:09:40,540
I played a lot.

2174
03:09:40,540 --> 03:09:42,540
I wrote on my debut,

2175
03:09:42,540 --> 03:09:45,540
I really liked the Blackwell series as well.

2176
03:09:45,540 --> 03:09:47,540
That's also from Watch It Eye.

2177
03:09:49,540 --> 03:09:51,540
Yeah, I played, I played a lot.

2178
03:09:51,540 --> 03:09:52,540
I played a lot.

2179
03:09:52,540 --> 03:09:53,540
Oh yeah, I played

2180
03:09:55,540 --> 03:09:56,540
the 8-bit game,

2181
03:09:56,540 --> 03:09:57,540
the 8-bit anthology.

2182
03:09:58,540 --> 03:09:59,540
So I finished that one.

2183
03:09:59,540 --> 03:10:00,540
It wasn't too bad actually.

2184
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:01,540
I thought it would be harder.

2185
03:10:05,540 --> 03:10:06,540
And

2186
03:10:08,540 --> 03:10:09,540
yeah.

2187
03:10:11,540 --> 03:10:12,540
I played quite a bit.

2188
03:10:12,540 --> 03:10:14,540
I played a little bit of Disco Legion,

2189
03:10:14,540 --> 03:10:16,540
but I totally forgot about it.

2190
03:10:16,540 --> 03:10:18,540
Because it's, it's, it's...

2191
03:10:21,540 --> 03:10:24,540
It's a game where I need time to play.

2192
03:10:28,540 --> 03:10:29,540
Any LucasArp?

2193
03:10:29,540 --> 03:10:30,540
Monkey Island?

2194
03:10:30,540 --> 03:10:31,540
Yeah, I played Monkey Island.

2195
03:10:31,540 --> 03:10:33,540
I think I have Monkey Island.

2196
03:10:34,540 --> 03:10:35,540
I played one and two.

2197
03:10:36,540 --> 03:10:37,540
I played one and two.

2198
03:10:41,540 --> 03:10:42,540
I played one and two.

2199
03:10:42,540 --> 03:10:45,540
I played the Rusty Lake series as well.

2200
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:49,540
I played Shadowgate.

2201
03:10:49,540 --> 03:10:50,540
Yeah, I played Shadowgate.

2202
03:10:55,540 --> 03:10:56,540
I played a lot.

2203
03:10:57,540 --> 03:10:58,540
I played a lot.

2204
03:11:02,540 --> 03:11:03,540
So I really like,

2205
03:11:04,540 --> 03:11:06,540
yeah, I like point and click games.

2206
03:11:06,540 --> 03:11:07,540
It's probably my favorite.

2207
03:11:10,540 --> 03:11:11,540
Because

2208
03:11:13,540 --> 03:11:15,540
have you played I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream?

2209
03:11:15,540 --> 03:11:16,540
Yes, I have.

2210
03:11:16,540 --> 03:11:17,540
I also read the short story.

2211
03:11:18,540 --> 03:11:20,540
I read the short story before I played it.

2212
03:11:28,540 --> 03:11:29,540
I played a lot.

2213
03:11:29,540 --> 03:11:30,540
I think when I was

2214
03:11:32,540 --> 03:11:35,540
a young, a young Mercy, baby Mercy,

2215
03:11:35,540 --> 03:11:37,540
um,

2216
03:11:38,540 --> 03:11:40,540
what, what happened

2217
03:11:42,540 --> 03:11:43,540
in,

2218
03:11:43,540 --> 03:11:45,540
what used to happen was

2219
03:11:47,540 --> 03:11:48,540
maybe older,

2220
03:11:48,540 --> 03:11:50,540
a bit of older supplies will know.

2221
03:11:54,540 --> 03:11:57,540
Do you remember the era

2222
03:11:57,540 --> 03:11:59,540
when

2223
03:11:59,540 --> 03:12:01,540
video games, they would,

2224
03:12:01,540 --> 03:12:04,540
they would put CD-ROM games on like everything.

2225
03:12:04,540 --> 03:12:06,540
So in like your cereal,

2226
03:12:06,540 --> 03:12:08,540
your macaroni,

2227
03:12:08,540 --> 03:12:10,540
like you would just get,

2228
03:12:10,540 --> 03:12:13,540
get CD-ROM games as a bonus content.

2229
03:12:17,540 --> 03:12:18,540
So

2230
03:12:19,540 --> 03:12:21,540
that's how I got into point and click.

2231
03:12:22,540 --> 03:12:24,540
Because I got,

2232
03:12:26,540 --> 03:12:27,540
I got one

2233
03:12:29,540 --> 03:12:30,540
called,

2234
03:12:31,540 --> 03:12:32,540
from Disney.

2235
03:12:35,540 --> 03:12:37,540
Called Hades Challenge.

2236
03:12:45,540 --> 03:12:48,540
Called Hades Challenge that I got,

2237
03:12:48,540 --> 03:12:50,540
I believe from

2238
03:12:51,540 --> 03:12:52,540
a cereal.

2239
03:12:53,540 --> 03:12:54,540
And

2240
03:12:54,540 --> 03:12:56,540
I've never been the same ever since.

2241
03:12:59,540 --> 03:13:00,540
Playing flash games.

2242
03:13:00,540 --> 03:13:02,540
Yes, I used to play flash games.

2243
03:13:02,540 --> 03:13:04,540
There was one

2244
03:13:04,540 --> 03:13:06,540
point and click that no one could solve.

2245
03:13:06,540 --> 03:13:08,540
But I was the only one

2246
03:13:08,540 --> 03:13:11,540
amongst, amongst my peers

2247
03:13:11,540 --> 03:13:12,540
in,

2248
03:13:13,540 --> 03:13:16,540
in school, in school, in grade school.

2249
03:13:24,540 --> 03:13:25,540
That,

2250
03:13:25,540 --> 03:13:27,540
that solved it.

2251
03:13:28,540 --> 03:13:29,540
It was called Detention.

2252
03:13:29,540 --> 03:13:31,540
It was called Detention.

2253
03:13:32,540 --> 03:13:33,540
Detention.

2254
03:13:38,540 --> 03:13:40,540
Three decades ago, that can't be right.

2255
03:13:44,540 --> 03:13:46,540
So yeah, I played

2256
03:13:46,540 --> 03:13:48,540
that one.

2257
03:13:48,540 --> 03:13:50,540
And yeah, I've never,

2258
03:13:50,540 --> 03:13:52,540
it's, it's ended up being my favorite genre.

2259
03:13:52,540 --> 03:13:54,540
My favorite genre

2260
03:13:54,540 --> 03:13:56,540
for games are definitely like,

2261
03:13:56,540 --> 03:13:58,540
kind of detective, detective.

2262
03:13:58,540 --> 03:14:00,540
That's why I really like a lot of horror,

2263
03:14:00,540 --> 03:14:02,540
not, not first person horror.

2264
03:14:02,540 --> 03:14:03,540
They make me barf.

2265
03:14:03,540 --> 03:14:04,540
I'm sorry.

2266
03:14:04,540 --> 03:14:05,540
If,

2267
03:14:05,540 --> 03:14:06,540
like,

2268
03:14:06,540 --> 03:14:07,540
cosmophobia,

2269
03:14:07,540 --> 03:14:08,540
I can't do it.

2270
03:14:08,540 --> 03:14:09,540
I have,

2271
03:14:09,540 --> 03:14:11,540
I have a game called,

2272
03:14:13,540 --> 03:14:15,540
what was this game called again?

2273
03:14:15,540 --> 03:14:16,540
Anyways, it's a lovecraftian one.

2274
03:14:16,540 --> 03:14:18,540
First person makes me barf.

2275
03:14:18,540 --> 03:14:19,540
Can't do it.

2276
03:14:25,540 --> 03:14:26,540
Can't do it.

2277
03:14:26,540 --> 03:14:28,540
That one is

2278
03:14:31,540 --> 03:14:32,540
I like horror.

2279
03:14:32,540 --> 03:14:35,540
So that's why I like a lot of horror visual novels.

2280
03:14:35,540 --> 03:14:38,540
Because I feel like it's unraveling a mystery.

2281
03:14:38,540 --> 03:14:40,540
So I like the story,

2282
03:14:40,540 --> 03:14:41,540
story aspect of it.

2283
03:14:41,540 --> 03:14:42,540
That's why,

2284
03:14:42,540 --> 03:14:44,540
that might be a reason why I really like pointing click as well,

2285
03:14:44,540 --> 03:14:45,540
is because like,

2286
03:14:45,540 --> 03:14:47,540
you kind of unravel the mystery.

2287
03:14:47,540 --> 03:14:49,540
I like putting things together.

2288
03:14:49,540 --> 03:14:50,540
It's really fun.

2289
03:14:53,540 --> 03:14:55,540
I haven't played the full throttle yet.

2290
03:14:55,540 --> 03:14:56,540
Um,

2291
03:14:56,540 --> 03:14:57,540
the one

2292
03:14:57,540 --> 03:14:58,540
I did play

2293
03:14:58,540 --> 03:14:59,540
for

2294
03:14:59,540 --> 03:15:00,540
Call of Cthulhu

2295
03:15:00,540 --> 03:15:01,540
for a pointing click,

2296
03:15:01,540 --> 03:15:03,540
which was called prisoner of ice.

2297
03:15:03,540 --> 03:15:04,540
I think

2298
03:15:04,540 --> 03:15:06,540
it was just called prisoner of ice.

2299
03:15:06,540 --> 03:15:08,540
And then I think it got adapted into the Call of Cthulhu

2300
03:15:08,540 --> 03:15:09,540
brand.

2301
03:15:10,540 --> 03:15:11,540
I'm not sure.

2302
03:15:14,540 --> 03:15:15,540
Not sure.

2303
03:15:15,540 --> 03:15:16,540
Grim Fandango.

2304
03:15:16,540 --> 03:15:18,540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

2305
03:15:18,540 --> 03:15:20,540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

2306
03:15:20,540 --> 03:15:22,540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

2307
03:15:22,540 --> 03:15:24,540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

2308
03:15:24,540 --> 03:15:26,540
I've already played Grim Fandango.

2309
03:15:26,540 --> 03:15:27,540
Yeah.

2310
03:15:27,540 --> 03:15:28,540
Um,

2311
03:15:31,540 --> 03:15:32,540
Cata,

2312
03:15:32,540 --> 03:15:33,540
Categra?

2313
03:15:33,540 --> 03:15:35,540
I think I actually have Categra.

2314
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:39,540
Categra?

2315
03:15:39,540 --> 03:15:40,540
I don't know.

2316
03:15:40,540 --> 03:15:41,540
Do I have it?

2317
03:15:44,540 --> 03:15:45,540
I might not.

2318
03:15:45,540 --> 03:15:47,540
I have some,

2319
03:15:47,540 --> 03:15:49,540
some games on my wishlist too.

2320
03:15:55,540 --> 03:15:57,540
Talking about Call of Cthulhu prisoner of ice.

2321
03:15:57,540 --> 03:15:58,540
Yes, yes, yes.

2322
03:15:58,540 --> 03:16:00,540
Have you read Dead End?

2323
03:16:00,540 --> 03:16:01,540
I guess not yet.

2324
03:16:01,540 --> 03:16:02,540
Not yet.

2325
03:16:06,540 --> 03:16:07,540
Uh,

2326
03:16:07,540 --> 03:16:09,540
the next game I was planning to play

2327
03:16:09,540 --> 03:16:11,540
for visual novels was,

2328
03:16:11,540 --> 03:16:12,540
what was it called again?

2329
03:16:12,540 --> 03:16:13,540
Muv Love.

2330
03:16:13,540 --> 03:16:15,540
I was planning to play Muv Love

2331
03:16:15,540 --> 03:16:16,540
for my next visual novel.

2332
03:16:17,540 --> 03:16:18,540
But,

2333
03:16:19,540 --> 03:16:21,540
I might save it

2334
03:16:21,540 --> 03:16:23,540
to, to read with some pies.

2335
03:16:24,540 --> 03:16:25,540
In the future.

2336
03:16:37,540 --> 03:16:38,540
Which Muv Love?

2337
03:16:38,540 --> 03:16:39,540
Probably the first one.

2338
03:16:39,540 --> 03:16:41,540
I like going in order.

2339
03:16:41,540 --> 03:16:42,540
Unless people don't,

2340
03:16:42,540 --> 03:16:44,540
unless people don't suggest that,

2341
03:16:44,540 --> 03:16:45,540
then maybe I,

2342
03:16:45,540 --> 03:16:47,540
I'll play a different one.

2343
03:16:47,540 --> 03:16:48,540
Like,

2344
03:16:53,540 --> 03:16:54,540
but I'm not really sure.

2345
03:16:54,540 --> 03:16:56,540
I have a lot of games I,

2346
03:16:56,540 --> 03:16:57,540
I want to play.

2347
03:16:57,540 --> 03:16:58,540
There's also,

2348
03:16:58,540 --> 03:16:59,540
there's also a bunch of newer games

2349
03:16:59,540 --> 03:17:00,540
that I want to play too.

2350
03:17:00,540 --> 03:17:01,540
Like, I really want to play

2351
03:17:01,540 --> 03:17:02,540
the Princess Peach game.

2352
03:17:13,540 --> 03:17:14,540
Like, the Princess Peach game

2353
03:17:14,540 --> 03:17:15,540
I really want to play

2354
03:17:15,540 --> 03:17:16,540
and I want to play Mario RPG,

2355
03:17:16,540 --> 03:17:17,540
the remake one.

2356
03:17:17,540 --> 03:17:18,540
So,

2357
03:17:18,540 --> 03:17:19,540
there's some,

2358
03:17:19,540 --> 03:17:20,540
some games that I really want to play

2359
03:17:20,540 --> 03:17:21,540
that are like newer.

2360
03:17:27,540 --> 03:17:28,540
Are you interested in fallout games

2361
03:17:28,540 --> 03:17:29,540
that are point and click?

2362
03:17:29,540 --> 03:17:31,540
The older fallout games?

2363
03:17:31,540 --> 03:17:32,540
Really?

2364
03:17:34,540 --> 03:17:35,540
First Muv Love

2365
03:17:35,540 --> 03:17:38,540
is more rom-com alternative sci-fi one.

2366
03:17:39,540 --> 03:17:41,540
Then maybe I'll play alternative instead.

2367
03:17:47,540 --> 03:17:48,540
Pay attention!

2368
03:17:48,540 --> 03:17:50,540
Pay attention, Senpai!

2369
03:17:52,540 --> 03:17:53,540
Didn't you pay attention

2370
03:17:53,540 --> 03:17:54,540
to my likes and dislikes before?

2371
03:17:54,540 --> 03:17:56,540
I'll have to remind you again!

2372
03:17:59,540 --> 03:18:01,540
I'll have to remind my Senpais again!

2373
03:18:04,540 --> 03:18:05,540
Silly?

2374
03:18:11,540 --> 03:18:12,540
Silly?

2375
03:18:12,540 --> 03:18:13,540
Silly?

2376
03:18:15,540 --> 03:18:16,540
What's on my list?

2377
03:18:16,540 --> 03:18:17,540
What's on my list?

2378
03:18:17,540 --> 03:18:20,540
These are what I have on my list, Senpai!

2379
03:18:24,540 --> 03:18:25,540
Memorize it!

2380
03:18:25,540 --> 03:18:26,540
Memorize it!

2381
03:18:36,540 --> 03:18:37,540
You memorizing it?

2382
03:18:37,540 --> 03:18:38,540
Yes?

2383
03:18:38,540 --> 03:18:39,540
Good!

2384
03:18:39,540 --> 03:18:40,540
I gave you a little time.

2385
03:18:43,540 --> 03:18:44,540
Good!

2386
03:18:50,540 --> 03:18:51,540
Good, good, good.

2387
03:18:51,540 --> 03:18:52,540
You all memorize it.

2388
03:18:52,540 --> 03:18:53,540
That's very good.

2389
03:18:57,540 --> 03:18:59,540
Please don't be a quiz on this later.

2390
03:18:59,540 --> 03:19:01,540
I just remember...

2391
03:19:02,540 --> 03:19:03,540
I just want you guys to remember

2392
03:19:03,540 --> 03:19:05,540
which games that I have already said

2393
03:19:05,540 --> 03:19:06,540
that are my favorites.

2394
03:19:07,540 --> 03:19:09,540
So we don't have any repeats.

2395
03:19:09,540 --> 03:19:10,540
Understand?

2396
03:19:10,540 --> 03:19:11,540
I'm just kidding.

2397
03:19:19,540 --> 03:19:20,540
So those are a lot of games

2398
03:19:20,540 --> 03:19:22,540
that are considered the best for me.

2399
03:19:22,540 --> 03:19:24,540
I might like things,

2400
03:19:24,540 --> 03:19:26,540
but these are the games that I love.

2401
03:19:27,540 --> 03:19:28,540
I hope that makes sense.

2402
03:19:28,540 --> 03:19:30,500
that are considered the best of the best for me.

2403
03:19:30,500 --> 03:19:33,180
I might like things, but like these are the games

2404
03:19:33,180 --> 03:19:35,380
that I love.

2405
03:19:35,380 --> 03:19:36,580
I hope that makes sense.

2406
03:19:40,580 --> 03:19:41,580
Ha ha ha ha!

2407
03:19:43,740 --> 03:19:44,820
Have you ever tried Fighting Game?

2408
03:19:44,820 --> 03:19:45,660
Yeah.

2409
03:19:45,660 --> 03:19:50,580
One Fighting Game I'm only kind of decently okay at

2410
03:19:50,580 --> 03:19:51,820
was Tekken.

2411
03:19:53,140 --> 03:19:56,300
When I say decently kind of okay, I mean,

2412
03:19:56,300 --> 03:19:59,700
I made one person rage quit once and I feel like

2413
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:01,820
that was pretty good.

2414
03:20:08,060 --> 03:20:09,700
Oh yeah, I play Kuma by the way.

2415
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:11,220
I play Kuma.

2416
03:20:11,220 --> 03:20:13,980
A game that felt pretty good when I played it

2417
03:20:13,980 --> 03:20:18,140
as a Fighting Game was Arms.

2418
03:20:18,140 --> 03:20:19,700
I really liked Arms.

2419
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:21,300
I would say Arms is a fighting game.

2420
03:20:21,300 --> 03:20:23,820
So I really liked the feel of Arms.

2421
03:20:23,820 --> 03:20:28,820
I love using the joystick controllers for Arms,

2422
03:20:28,980 --> 03:20:32,140
where you like literally punch like wow, wow, wow, wow.

2423
03:20:32,140 --> 03:20:34,220
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2424
03:20:34,220 --> 03:20:35,740
That felt really good.

2425
03:20:35,740 --> 03:20:38,420
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2426
03:20:38,420 --> 03:20:41,180
And I was like wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!

2427
03:20:44,380 --> 03:20:45,140
Tend to switch arms?

2428
03:20:45,140 --> 03:20:46,180
Yeah, that one.

2429
03:20:47,180 --> 03:20:48,260
That one felt really good.

2430
03:20:48,260 --> 03:20:51,420
I love whacking people using the joystick controllers.

2431
03:20:51,540 --> 03:20:53,180
Da da da da da da da da!

2432
03:20:53,180 --> 03:20:54,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2433
03:20:56,260 --> 03:20:57,260
That was really fun.

2434
03:20:59,300 --> 03:21:01,540
What's another fighting game that I kind of like?

2435
03:21:03,380 --> 03:21:08,380
I kind of really like the feel of Dead or Alive as well.

2436
03:21:13,900 --> 03:21:14,940
Is that game still active?

2437
03:21:14,940 --> 03:21:16,540
I don't think Arms is still active,

2438
03:21:16,540 --> 03:21:20,380
but if you guys make Arms active again,

2439
03:21:20,380 --> 03:21:22,580
I might do some training sessions

2440
03:21:22,580 --> 03:21:24,780
and I might beat the shit out of everyone.

2441
03:21:24,780 --> 03:21:26,780
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2442
03:21:33,540 --> 03:21:34,780
Are you with 2D fighters?

2443
03:21:34,780 --> 03:21:37,380
I don't really play 2D fighters, honestly.

2444
03:21:39,900 --> 03:21:42,340
The feel of the jiggles, the feel of the game.

2445
03:21:42,340 --> 03:21:45,140
I know people are like oh my gosh, that's a porn game.

2446
03:21:45,140 --> 03:21:46,260
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

2447
03:21:46,900 --> 03:21:50,060
It's all shitty, it's a shitty, sexy lady game.

2448
03:21:51,340 --> 03:21:53,140
I have to preach.

2449
03:21:53,140 --> 03:21:56,620
I'm just letting you guys know that it feels good.

2450
03:21:56,620 --> 03:21:58,420
Like I feel like the impact,

2451
03:21:58,420 --> 03:22:02,140
you feel the impact of when they hit each other pretty good.

2452
03:22:05,300 --> 03:22:06,460
Does that make sense?

2453
03:22:09,740 --> 03:22:11,460
I don't really play any other games

2454
03:22:11,460 --> 03:22:14,380
because, well, it's too technical for me.

2455
03:22:16,700 --> 03:22:17,860
And I don't really like that.

2456
03:22:17,860 --> 03:22:18,980
I don't really like it.

2457
03:22:23,500 --> 03:22:24,700
I don't really like it.

2458
03:22:24,700 --> 03:22:25,780
So it's whatever.

2459
03:22:29,180 --> 03:22:32,020
That one, yeah.

2460
03:22:32,020 --> 03:22:35,860
Yeah, those are the fighting games I enjoy.

2461
03:22:35,860 --> 03:22:39,980
Otherwise, I don't really play a lot of fighting games,

2462
03:22:39,980 --> 03:22:43,100
mostly because it's kind of required

2463
03:22:44,020 --> 03:22:45,540
to play with other people.

2464
03:22:45,540 --> 03:22:50,540
I'm kind of a loner.

2465
03:22:52,380 --> 03:22:54,260
I'm kind of a solo player.

2466
03:22:54,260 --> 03:22:57,260
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

2467
03:23:02,740 --> 03:23:05,700
Um, have you ever played with a PS Vita?

2468
03:23:05,700 --> 03:23:08,380
Yeah, a PS Vita was my second console

2469
03:23:08,380 --> 03:23:11,620
that I have ever had.

2470
03:23:11,620 --> 03:23:13,940
I had a PS Vita before I had a PS4.

2471
03:23:21,020 --> 03:23:25,060
Um, yeah.

2472
03:23:26,740 --> 03:23:29,020
You tried Monster Hunter before?

2473
03:23:29,020 --> 03:23:31,700
This might sound a little weird

2474
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:35,580
coming from, well, a Yandere,

2475
03:23:35,580 --> 03:23:38,580
but I feel kind of bad hitting the monsters,

2476
03:23:38,580 --> 03:23:42,260
which is why I don't really like Monster Hunter,

2477
03:23:42,260 --> 03:23:43,940
or I don't really want to play Monster Hunter.

2478
03:23:43,940 --> 03:23:45,500
I feel bad for hitting them.

2479
03:23:45,500 --> 03:23:47,740
I think they're really cute.

2480
03:23:47,740 --> 03:23:49,380
So I feel bad for hitting them.

2481
03:24:00,940 --> 03:24:02,420
You feel bad for hitting us?

2482
03:24:03,220 --> 03:24:03,980
Mmm.

2483
03:24:06,980 --> 03:24:10,980
Sometimes, but sometimes I feel bad,

2484
03:24:10,980 --> 03:24:16,380
but I feel like, you know,

2485
03:24:16,380 --> 03:24:18,660
sometimes SEMPAI deserved it,

2486
03:24:18,660 --> 03:24:21,220
and sometimes SEMPAI forces my hand.

2487
03:24:23,700 --> 03:24:28,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2488
03:24:33,220 --> 03:24:44,740
Sometimes my hand's forced.

2489
03:24:44,740 --> 03:24:45,820
I don't want to.

2490
03:24:45,820 --> 03:24:50,020
I don't want to hurt my SEMPAI, but, you know,

2491
03:24:52,940 --> 03:24:54,700
sometimes you have to.

2492
03:24:57,220 --> 03:24:58,060
OK?

2493
03:24:58,060 --> 03:25:09,340
Sometimes we, we have to, I, it's always my arm being twisted, it's always my arm being

2494
03:25:09,340 --> 03:25:16,860
twisted I never want to do anything but sometimes I always want to run away from me or, or you

2495
03:25:16,860 --> 03:25:39,740
know, they do ridiculous things like want to leave so yeah sometimes I have to punish I don't

2496
03:25:39,740 --> 03:25:44,380
want to it hurts it hurts my feelings hurts my feelings a whole lot

2497
03:25:54,220 --> 03:26:01,500
so when that happens I I might get a little violent I might get a little not violent I'd

2498
03:26:01,500 --> 03:26:04,060
rather say I get a little strict yeah yellow strict

2499
03:26:10,540 --> 03:26:16,300
oh wait what were we talking about again I am monster hunter yeah I feel bad for hitting them

2500
03:26:16,300 --> 03:26:22,780
I feel bad for hitting the them so I I don't really play monster hunter I just feel bad

2501
03:26:31,980 --> 03:26:39,420
so I'm trying to think what are we talking about games right games yeah I have like a lot of games

2502
03:26:39,420 --> 03:26:47,660
that I want to try playing so I tried to pick a variety of different games that this week that I

2503
03:26:47,660 --> 03:26:56,940
personally really like so like an RPG I don't like punishing games but I feel like a difficult game

2504
03:26:56,940 --> 03:27:03,980
about climbing is very entertaining for senpai's um because you'll hear me hear me get like really

2505
03:27:03,980 --> 03:27:09,100
angry and scream a lot so I warn I'll warn everyone that's a pretty loud that's gonna be a pretty

2506
03:27:09,100 --> 03:27:23,660
loud stream so please keep your uh volumes at a fairly low fairly fairly low um fairly fairly low

2507
03:27:23,660 --> 03:27:27,900
volume yeah

2508
03:27:33,980 --> 03:27:39,420
strategies games oh I get bored with strategy games um

2509
03:27:43,020 --> 03:27:51,100
yeah I get bored with uh strategy games I don't think how do I say this senpai I'm not a very

2510
03:27:54,620 --> 03:27:58,380
seasoned gamer I don't think I'm ready for Elden Ring yet

2511
03:28:00,860 --> 03:28:08,940
I don't think I'm ready for Elden Ring yet so like any souls like games I don't think I'm ready for it yet

2512
03:28:12,060 --> 03:28:18,300
because um I've only kind of recently started picking up games again uh

2513
03:28:18,620 --> 03:28:29,180
you know uh mercy mom mercy mercy mama mercy papa are a bit strict

2514
03:28:30,860 --> 03:28:34,220
so I only recently got a lot of freedom

2515
03:28:41,100 --> 03:28:46,300
so I recently only got a lot of freedom and I decided to use that freedom to play games

2516
03:28:46,300 --> 03:28:51,500
yeah so I'm still I feel I consider myself a beginner because otherwise the game before

2517
03:28:51,500 --> 03:28:57,420
that I played before that were all either just like visual novels and like Pokemon

2518
03:29:00,540 --> 03:29:09,340
um so I I'm very late to gaming um my parents never let me have like a sit-down console where

2519
03:29:09,340 --> 03:29:13,980
you know you put a home console where you put it on the the tele a tv

2520
03:29:17,020 --> 03:29:26,380
that one I've never got got one of those so only when I got older I was allowed to have a

2521
03:29:28,220 --> 03:29:35,500
I was all I was allowed to have a handheld system so the handheld system I got was a DS light

2522
03:29:35,500 --> 03:29:45,660
the only reason I got a DS light was because mama and papa saw that saw a commercial for big brain academy

2523
03:29:47,740 --> 03:29:50,620
and that's the only reason why I was able to get a DS

2524
03:29:55,740 --> 03:30:01,100
which pokemon have you played I'm not a big pokemon person so I've only played

2525
03:30:01,740 --> 03:30:09,420
Pearl platinum whatever the news soul silver

2526
03:30:12,140 --> 03:30:14,620
I think I ended at soul silver

2527
03:30:16,220 --> 03:30:22,140
yeah anything after black was like no and I think I picked it up again with

2528
03:30:24,380 --> 03:30:26,780
Sword and Shield I don't remember which one I have

2529
03:30:27,740 --> 03:30:33,180
I picked it up again with the newer installment I forgot what the newer installment is called

2530
03:30:37,260 --> 03:30:39,500
yeah I played the the DS ones yeah

2531
03:30:43,020 --> 03:30:47,020
yeah Scarlet and Violet yeah I played I think I have Violet yeah I have Violet

2532
03:30:47,100 --> 03:30:49,660
so

2533
03:30:53,660 --> 03:31:00,460
yeah I I got a DS because of that and then after I got good grades and stuff I was

2534
03:31:00,460 --> 03:31:09,420
allotted to pick I was allowed to pick one game one game that was that I was gonna I'm gonna get

2535
03:31:09,420 --> 03:31:15,980
and I picked pokemon pearl that's my second game because everyone loved it and then I lined up I

2536
03:31:16,140 --> 03:31:24,700
lined up for the midnight release of pokemon diamond and pearl and then I got pearl because

2537
03:31:24,700 --> 03:31:31,260
there was a kid with me who was like pink is for girls so I'm gonna get diamond and so I got I

2538
03:31:31,260 --> 03:31:36,860
felt really vindictive at that point and was like fuck you I'll get pearl I'll beat the chair you

2539
03:31:37,580 --> 03:31:39,580
know

2540
03:31:42,460 --> 03:31:46,140
that's that's what I had decided

2541
03:31:54,140 --> 03:32:01,340
I felt I felt really angie about that so I decided to get pearl just to spite him

2542
03:32:01,500 --> 03:32:08,860
and so the midnight release was really cool that was my first time doing our midnight release

2543
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:19,660
uh game and then I slowly convinced uh if I kept on getting good grades I would be treated to games

2544
03:32:20,700 --> 03:32:29,420
and so I slowly built up a pretty impressive 3ds library I mean not 3ds a DS library sorry

2545
03:32:31,900 --> 03:32:42,700
so that's why I am kind of new to gaming I'm kind of new to gaming um my first sit-down console

2546
03:32:42,700 --> 03:33:00,140
was a ps4 so yeah I played a back then back then I I was so happy because uh because DS games are

2547
03:33:00,140 --> 03:33:08,060
really cheap DS games are really cheap it was so it was so easy to get and now get and now

2548
03:33:08,060 --> 03:33:13,420
nowadays I look at the prices of games and go whoa when did that happen

2549
03:33:16,380 --> 03:33:24,380
and but yeah eventually I got myself I convinced I convinced um

2550
03:33:25,340 --> 03:33:32,460
I'm a kuma and pop a kuma to let me have a PS Vita and then I ended up getting a PSP

2551
03:33:33,420 --> 03:33:40,300
for pretty cheap because the Vita came out the Vita came out so I got a PSP as well and then

2552
03:33:45,820 --> 03:33:47,820
and then I

2553
03:33:50,060 --> 03:33:52,060
I uh

2554
03:33:54,380 --> 03:34:01,980
I started to play more gamer games by that time so the gamer games I was playing

2555
03:34:01,980 --> 03:34:17,900
Assassin's Creed Liberation I played Persona 3 portable at that time I got I was lucky in stores

2556
03:34:17,900 --> 03:34:29,340
one time I saw it was like I think Persona Innocence and I got I started and then I started to

2557
03:34:29,340 --> 03:34:35,900
really like the SMT series so then I got really into the SMT series and then when

2558
03:34:36,860 --> 03:34:47,580
SMT4 came out I bought the like what was it the beginner not the beginner limited yeah

2559
03:34:47,580 --> 03:34:56,060
limited edition version of it and I fell in love with that game I fell in love with SMT4

2560
03:34:57,340 --> 03:35:03,820
and then I I tried to play like other games in the SMT series as well and I started to

2561
03:35:03,820 --> 03:35:14,780
really like them and then eventually in college college I started to pick up uh retro games because

2562
03:35:14,860 --> 03:35:20,780
some of my my gal pals some of my gal pals were like oh well I don't really need I need I'm

2563
03:35:20,780 --> 03:35:27,020
making room do you want these consoles and these games and I said yes and then they they gave me

2564
03:35:27,020 --> 03:35:35,740
some they they graciously gave me some pretty pretty pog uh retro games and and their systems so

2565
03:35:35,740 --> 03:35:42,060
I was really surprised that I was just given given to them so I uh I acquired quite a collection right

2566
03:35:42,060 --> 03:35:47,260
now yeah I I acquired such a

2567
03:35:49,820 --> 03:35:54,460
uh uh collection are you gonna play Persona 3 Reloaded uh

2568
03:35:57,020 --> 03:36:04,700
kind of expensive guys like it's pretty expensive how does retro to you PS1 PS2

2569
03:36:12,780 --> 03:36:13,820
PS1 PS2

2570
03:36:16,460 --> 03:36:17,020
Gamecube

2571
03:36:19,660 --> 03:36:24,700
Nintendo 6v4

2572
03:36:31,740 --> 03:36:32,700
yeah

2573
03:36:32,940 --> 03:36:35,340
um

2574
03:36:41,660 --> 03:36:44,860
yeah um those are retro right

2575
03:36:49,100 --> 03:36:51,580
okay uh

2576
03:36:52,300 --> 03:36:52,780
uh

2577
03:36:55,900 --> 03:36:56,780
yeah those games

2578
03:37:00,300 --> 03:37:05,340
I consider them I consider them pretty old right um

2579
03:37:08,060 --> 03:37:13,820
I do have console I do have SNES as a console I don't know I don't think I have that many games for

2580
03:37:13,820 --> 03:37:17,020
it though um

2581
03:37:20,940 --> 03:37:22,940
I don't think I have that many games for it yeah

2582
03:37:26,060 --> 03:37:29,740
I have a lot of I have a lot of PS2 games though I have a lot

2583
03:37:32,540 --> 03:37:35,580
uh PS2 games

2584
03:37:36,540 --> 03:37:45,980
and I would love to play them I love to play them I also have a few PS3 games but I think I have

2585
03:37:45,980 --> 03:37:54,540
mostly PS2 games in my collection so those are the games I really enjoyed

2586
03:37:57,580 --> 03:38:03,980
uh or at least uh things that I'm gonna try to get into I'm gonna see if I can do streams with uh

2587
03:38:04,940 --> 03:38:13,660
like with the native um with the native consoles so that I'm I'm planning to maybe put like a

2588
03:38:13,660 --> 03:38:19,580
little CRT on my on my little desk and uh play games from there

2589
03:38:23,340 --> 03:38:27,900
so that's why I'm thinking I'm thinking that's what I'm gonna do I want to play the games that

2590
03:38:27,980 --> 03:38:40,540
are in the kind of pile of stuff that I already have because yeah I think I don't want to be that

2591
03:38:40,540 --> 03:38:46,060
person who keeps on buying games who keeps on buying games and not play them

2592
03:38:46,140 --> 03:38:48,220
um

2593
03:38:57,580 --> 03:39:03,740
so yeah I am uh the small small one it's not it's a bit heavy but it's not too bad

2594
03:39:08,060 --> 03:39:13,100
so I'd like to go through those through games that I already have so if I do have a game that

2595
03:39:13,100 --> 03:39:15,340
people have suggested well maybe I'll play it

2596
03:39:26,620 --> 03:39:34,460
so that's why yeah I'm thinking I'm hoping I'm hoping I'll be able to get uh what do you call that

2597
03:39:34,860 --> 03:39:41,980
and an hd upscaler I think that's what they're called

2598
03:39:44,220 --> 03:39:53,740
or borough one whatever borough one permanently I think it's called an hd upscaler uh to stream the

2599
03:39:53,740 --> 03:40:06,940
games so hopefully and then I'll find like some ways to to make sure all the games all the system

2600
03:40:06,940 --> 03:40:17,500
can be streamed on yeah I've I've done uh I gotta do a little bit of research but I think we can get it

2601
03:40:18,300 --> 03:40:28,140
I think we can get it and most of my plans have been um

2602
03:40:30,140 --> 03:40:38,060
been uh been kind of like yeah I'll just go through my library my library of games to play

2603
03:40:39,260 --> 03:40:44,220
but I did pick up something very special today guys uh some pie sorry

2604
03:40:45,100 --> 03:40:53,340
which is I picked up something for the upcoming ASMR stream which is I don't know if it's picking up on my mic

2605
03:40:58,620 --> 03:41:01,580
I'm not using the mic so yeah

2606
03:41:04,060 --> 03:41:08,700
I'm not using the the the 3dl right now so we can hear it

2607
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:13,260
I picked up some stuff for it

2608
03:41:19,500 --> 03:41:21,820
it'll be my first time trying out ASMR

2609
03:41:26,060 --> 03:41:32,940
so that's I'm very I'm very new to it so for ASMR I'll

2610
03:41:39,420 --> 03:41:40,940
get

2611
03:41:42,940 --> 03:41:44,940
I won't be out right

2612
03:41:47,420 --> 03:41:48,940
everyone

2613
03:42:09,660 --> 03:42:18,700
so it'll be all whispers and I I won't be as loud and I'll try not to laugh as much

2614
03:42:19,420 --> 03:42:26,940
so uh if if I laugh it'll be it'll be uh it'll be kind of like

2615
03:42:27,740 --> 03:42:39,340
something like that probably I'll try my best to suppress my my

2616
03:42:41,420 --> 03:42:41,900
laughter

2617
03:42:46,060 --> 03:42:51,100
so I'll try to suppress it just for that just for that stream

2618
03:42:51,260 --> 03:42:56,620
so that's why I feel

2619
03:42:58,860 --> 03:43:05,020
yeah I feel I feel like I'm going to do my do my best to pamper my supplies

2620
03:43:05,020 --> 03:43:12,380
I'm gonna try to pamper my supplies uh I bought a gel mask uh which I think makes a lovely little sound

2621
03:43:12,380 --> 03:43:19,020
so I'll massage that that eye mask uh so supplies can have a nice eye massage

2622
03:43:19,740 --> 03:43:21,500
and then

2623
03:43:23,660 --> 03:43:32,860
and then I have I have these little little ice ice globes that I'll I'll shake and yeah

2624
03:43:33,980 --> 03:43:39,580
I'll try my best I'll try my best to give a nice nice soft experience for supplies

2625
03:43:40,460 --> 03:43:53,980
well that being said I'm still very new to it so it's uh I might not be perfect so don't

2626
03:43:53,980 --> 03:44:02,700
don't don't don't put too much emphasis on it being great or anything it's definitely going to be a

2627
03:44:02,700 --> 03:44:12,140
learning curve that's why that's why I want to I want to I want to do my best to to make Senpai happy

2628
03:44:17,820 --> 03:44:25,500
and yeah we'll we'll see if if uh if I'm any if I'm okay at it maybe I'll do more

2629
03:44:26,060 --> 03:44:35,420
maybe I'll do more ASMR streams depending um unfortunately no no earlickies no earlickies

2630
03:44:35,420 --> 03:44:43,500
or anything because youtube's kind of going hard on on the no the no slurp slurp

2631
03:44:48,860 --> 03:44:53,020
not like we'll be able to go anywhere of course not I'll force you I'll force you to do it but

2632
03:44:53,020 --> 03:44:59,500
I still want I still want my Senpai to be like yes I want to be here you wanted to be here right Senpai

2633
03:45:06,620 --> 03:45:07,820
you wanted to be here

2634
03:45:13,260 --> 03:45:22,220
yeah I saw Emmys Vaude get cancelled get get get get banished got obliterated obliterated

2635
03:45:23,820 --> 03:45:30,700
so I thought oh yeah well time to time to well probably have to I have to be more careful with

2636
03:45:30,700 --> 03:45:37,500
ASMR so I'll do something very light and besides I'm kind of training myself to do ASMR stuff so I'll

2637
03:45:37,500 --> 03:45:44,380
do kind of the safer work stuff so don't think that it's going to be like the oh my god Senpai

2638
03:45:44,620 --> 03:45:53,740
don't think it's the Senpai I'm gonna stick my tongue in your ear now okay don't don't

2639
03:45:53,740 --> 03:45:56,780
don't think don't think about don't think it's gonna be like that

2640
03:46:04,860 --> 03:46:05,740
unfortunately

2641
03:46:05,740 --> 03:46:17,260
please don't think of uh please don't think it's gonna be something like that because uh I'll

2642
03:46:17,260 --> 03:46:28,380
probably get bonked I was thinking about doing a salon one in the future as well

2643
03:46:29,100 --> 03:46:36,220
so it's like you know snip snip the hair and maybe like a little hair wash

2644
03:46:43,180 --> 03:46:47,020
but like be careful don't move or else I'll snap your ears off

2645
03:46:47,660 --> 03:46:57,820
so I think um

2646
03:47:00,140 --> 03:47:04,380
yeah I can't think of anything else to yap about right now I feel like

2647
03:47:05,980 --> 03:47:10,140
I'm gonna be a broken record at this point my brain has been fried

2648
03:47:10,860 --> 03:47:17,820
green has been fried from learning killer 7 I'm probably gonna get used to it again don't worry about

2649
03:47:17,820 --> 03:47:27,820
it so I'm gonna I'm gonna try my best I'm gonna try my best uh to make all my Senpai's really happy

2650
03:47:27,820 --> 03:47:46,060
so yeah oh I feel so I feel a little bit tired I went out and uh go a bit far far to pick up

2651
03:47:46,060 --> 03:47:53,260
some of the the ASMR stuff that I wanted to to use for Senpai so it was it was quite it was

2652
03:47:53,260 --> 03:47:58,140
quite a far away to pick them up so

2653
03:48:02,620 --> 03:48:05,260
I don't know if anyone's streaming or anything right now

2654
03:48:10,220 --> 03:48:15,820
I might have to just end stream and not not raid or anything I'm not I'm still not familiar

2655
03:48:15,820 --> 03:48:20,940
with YouTube so I don't even know if how to raid very well

2656
03:48:23,740 --> 03:48:34,380
now I'm the last one that that that makes sense um that makes sense I I I've decided to take over

2657
03:48:34,380 --> 03:48:40,700
the late night stuff because uh in the morning in the morning I want to help out with chores

2658
03:48:41,660 --> 03:48:49,500
chores and and uh making sure everything's okay and ready and then I can finally visit my Senpai

2659
03:48:49,500 --> 03:49:02,620
in the basement that's why can we be chloroformed before you go are you having trouble uh sleeping

2660
03:49:02,620 --> 03:49:04,540
then

2661
03:49:06,780 --> 03:49:08,540
having trouble sleeping Senpai

2662
03:49:16,780 --> 03:49:24,140
I I do things that are uh I I do late night streams I'm a bit of a night owl actually

2663
03:49:24,140 --> 03:49:31,180
maybe I'm more of a afternoon owl I feel more productive within the afternoons to

2664
03:49:31,820 --> 03:49:38,940
to early evenings and then the time in the evenings is for me to relax and I feel video games are

2665
03:49:38,940 --> 03:49:42,940
sort of relaxing

2666
03:49:55,500 --> 03:50:00,540
uh I'm sorry that I always stream late for my Senpais or too early for my Senpai depending on

2667
03:50:00,540 --> 03:50:07,260
what time you are but um I did pick this time because it doesn't overlap with most of the girls

2668
03:50:09,420 --> 03:50:11,740
um honestly uh

2669
03:50:14,140 --> 03:50:25,100
viewer has thought of so much for for Senpais so we want to we wanted to to divide the time so

2670
03:50:25,100 --> 03:50:40,860
that there would be someone um taking over a certain time slot each each moment

2671
03:50:41,420 --> 03:50:46,860
so I feel like uh I got the night I got the night one because I don't think anyone really picked the

2672
03:50:46,860 --> 03:50:55,580
night uh I think Azura and I are kind of the the two night night streamers while I think morning

2673
03:50:55,580 --> 03:51:05,660
streams or I think it's night or daytime or icy and then I think strawneys soon soon falls after

2674
03:51:05,660 --> 03:51:13,260
and then uh I mean she be so they're they're kind of within like there's always like two girls for

2675
03:51:13,260 --> 03:51:17,820
each time you know

2676
03:51:23,660 --> 03:51:29,340
so I hope that that at least everyone gets to to meet up with uh with a girl or something

2677
03:51:31,660 --> 03:51:37,180
any ideas planned for the future like karaoke yeah I I'm doing karaoke I don't think I plan

2678
03:51:37,180 --> 03:51:47,340
karaoke until uh a couple weeks later um I plan my schedule kind of far in advance just so

2679
03:51:48,060 --> 03:51:53,740
there'll be time to to make like thumbnails and make sure everything works and schedule

2680
03:51:53,740 --> 03:51:56,700
and collabs and stuff so it's a lot

2681
03:52:01,500 --> 03:52:04,940
you're actually gonna share us with the others only with VLR

2682
03:52:07,260 --> 03:52:09,420
only with VLR because uh

2683
03:52:11,660 --> 03:52:21,100
I I legitimately love this company like I really do and I want the best and uh

2684
03:52:22,380 --> 03:52:27,580
I truly believe high tides floats off ships uh if you guys understand what that means

2685
03:52:30,060 --> 03:52:32,220
so I want every girl to succeed as well

2686
03:52:37,660 --> 03:52:40,220
so that's why that's why uh I

2687
03:52:46,140 --> 03:52:53,180
I want I want everyone to to have a good time even if I'm sharing my senpai even if I'm

2688
03:52:53,180 --> 03:52:57,420
sharing my senpai's but I know deep down that every senpai loves me the most

2689
03:52:57,900 --> 03:53:02,300
so yeah

2690
03:53:08,620 --> 03:53:15,820
because I really I really hope that everyone falls in love with uh each girl everyone works

2691
03:53:15,820 --> 03:53:25,820
really hard I will attest to the fact that all girls work really hard so um I feel like you

2692
03:53:25,820 --> 03:53:34,380
don't have to be into all of the girls but I feel like you should in in some way like each of the

2693
03:53:34,380 --> 03:53:36,300
girl I hope that makes sense

2694
03:53:42,540 --> 03:53:49,580
can I devote myself uh to only you if you want I feel very thankful if you do

2695
03:53:50,540 --> 03:53:56,940
uh but I do encourage people to to if if I am your oh she if I am your oh she

2696
03:53:57,660 --> 03:54:03,820
uh which I if I I I'm very thankful if if I am your oh she um

2697
03:54:07,420 --> 03:54:15,980
thank you for choosing me but I also you know if for example if a if an event or something

2698
03:54:15,980 --> 03:54:21,420
or a girl's a girl's having achievement I feel like we should celebrate all together

2699
03:54:22,220 --> 03:54:22,940
does that make sense

2700
03:54:25,900 --> 03:54:29,340
so I feel like we should still celebrate uh their achievements

2701
03:54:29,500 --> 03:54:38,700
um

2702
03:54:42,300 --> 03:54:46,940
like not all the girls are are very sweet and I love them all so much I will not have any

2703
03:54:46,940 --> 03:54:48,700
VLR slander in here

2704
03:54:49,100 --> 03:55:02,620
but yeah if you if you do have a favorite if you do have a favorite I think if it's me

2705
03:55:02,620 --> 03:55:08,940
I'm just very honored if it's one of the other girls I'm sure they are also very happy and very

2706
03:55:08,940 --> 03:55:18,940
blessed that you have chosen the men's there as uh as their oh she as your oh she so I'm very

2707
03:55:20,220 --> 03:55:26,060
very very happy I feel very thankful I see a lot of people I my supplies I see a lot of

2708
03:55:26,060 --> 03:55:31,900
some pies say that I'm their favorite which makes me really really giddy really giddy and

2709
03:55:31,900 --> 03:55:36,860
kind of shy that's I'm kind of shy about it now

2710
03:55:39,820 --> 03:55:43,340
but um yeah I I'm glad

2711
03:55:47,740 --> 03:55:52,700
I'm glad I'm glad though so I'm I'm okay to share with everyone

2712
03:55:54,380 --> 03:56:01,020
but just remember you are mine when you're here you're mine when you're here with me you're mine

2713
03:56:01,740 --> 03:56:08,140
no one else you can talk about some people only if I talk about them otherwise it's just you

2714
03:56:13,580 --> 03:56:14,140
all right

2715
03:56:20,140 --> 03:56:26,140

2716
03:56:31,820 --> 03:56:41,340
I'll let you go this time senpai I'll let you go but you'll be back

2717
03:56:44,460 --> 03:56:53,580
I had lots of fun playing killer seven uh with everyone I am so happy to be here and I hope

2718
03:56:54,460 --> 03:57:03,100
tomorrow's Omori stream will be of interest to my senpai as well um I haven't played Omori to

2719
03:57:03,100 --> 03:57:08,460
completion at all I played a little bit of it and then I forgot what happened so it'll be almost

2720
03:57:08,460 --> 03:57:19,980
like a fresh take almost I can almost fresh taste and then after that throughout the week I'll be

2721
03:57:19,980 --> 03:57:26,300
pretty full uh wow I feel like a broken record now just repeating this uh the following week though

2722
03:57:26,300 --> 03:57:32,540
I all streams will be reduced quite a significant quite significantly to about three streams

2723
03:57:33,900 --> 03:57:41,420
three streams per and then eventually I'll probably go up up a little bit back to five

2724
03:57:42,140 --> 03:57:50,380
up to five streams a week simply because this week I want to keep the hype going I want to

2725
03:57:50,380 --> 03:57:55,100
keep the hype going I want senpais to get to know me better I want to know more about my senpais

2726
03:57:55,100 --> 03:58:04,380
as well um what everyone's into what you're not into that's what I'm doing so yeah it'll be a lot

2727
03:58:04,380 --> 03:58:16,460
