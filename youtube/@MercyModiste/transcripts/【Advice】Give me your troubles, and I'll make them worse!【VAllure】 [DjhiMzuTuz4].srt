54
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,760
that I've been struggling with for many years I've always had self-confidence and

55
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,920
esteem issues that's made it really hard for me to break out of my own shell and

56
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,400
not cringe at every little thing I say or do in public I'm too aware of how I

57
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:28,400
present myself to others and it's only made me withdrawn over time is there

58
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,000
anything you practice doing before a stream or in general social situations

59
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,360
that help you feel more natural and less anxious any advice you could give me

60
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:47,040
about confidence would be graciously appreciated love the streams and I only

61
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:59,760
wish the best for you and be allure okay thank you thank you oh thank you for the

62
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:09,720
question I may give you a little bit of a serious answer for this one doing my own

63
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:36,480
story I cringe at this sometimes and remember I went hiking once I went

64
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,240
hiking once this sounds bad that sounds terrible this was once and I will be very

65
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,880
embarrassed about it ever since and so use the story as your pillar of

66
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:55,680
confidence okay pillar of confidence I was hiking in a very popular hiking area

67
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,880
it was so unusually crowded at that time okay you see what I'm talking about

68
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:18,160
you're trying to see okay I may have I may have no no it's not vomit shut the

69
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:28,640
shut the fuck up shut the fuck up I'm trying to tell a story here I may have in

70
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:36,960
a moment may have close your ears close your ears close your ears for all those

71
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,600
who are sensitive okay okay close your ears

72
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:52,880
I let out I let out I accidentally let out the biggest the biggest toot the biggest toot

73
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:02,880
I let out the biggest toot and about 500 heads

74
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:43,120
so many people look at me you cannot have that worse okay and you know what I'm

75
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,960
never gonna see those people ever again that story someone's gonna say that

76
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,600
story and in front of their family do their friends they're all gonna tell

77
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:11,440
that start of someone it was in the woods okay

78
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:23,960
they're telling that story to each other and I will want to tell you that those

79
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:34,520
people do not know who I am do I still go out to this day yes because no one

80
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:40,680
will remember you you are a speck and all they care about is what happens in the

81
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:51,480
moment no one will say oh yeah do you remember that guy and that person in the

82
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:58,200
jeans wow they twitched once and I'm gonna remember that forever no no no they

83
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:19,960
will remember and I've been very conscious about that ever since

84
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:40,160
so I hope that helps in a way to help your self-confidence and self-esteem

85
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,640
issues because your confidence is self-esteem issues aren't gonna go

86
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:55,400
away that's or it's not gonna go away overnight what I personally practice is

87
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:05,000
that everyone when I was on stage doing theater doing stuff even even with

88
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:14,560
movies right I would be always blinded by the spotlight and when you're blinded

89
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,240
by the spot spotlight gets what you see nothing maybe you can see the most is

90
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:33,440
the outline shadow of someone but you cannot really see anything and that's

91
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,760
what I always think about when when I do something in public is that you know the

92
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,800
spotlight is blinding everyone I don't see anyone they're all gone there's only

93
00:21:46,800 --> 00:22:04,080
just me and whatever thingy I'm doing right now so I know that it's a very

94
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:12,960
cringe story and I that was one accident but I'm sure that you being

95
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,440
hyper focused on whatever whatever you're doing is not gonna be as worse as

96
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,760
what I did

97
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,920
okay I passed back on

98
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm actually in need of a shave and a haircut so I need my lovely Cole highs

99
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,920
input do you like your Senpai with a beard and what is your preferable hair

100
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:09,920
length I don't know what's comfortable with you Senpai my personal preference

101
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,680
for hair I know my hair is currently like pretty long right now but my personal

102
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:25,480
preference for hair is short because less shower time it's less shower time

103
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,080
it's less shower time it's more efficient you dry your hair so fast

104
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:50,520
saved on shampoo but if you like but all your preferences your own preference do

105
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,960
you like longer hair if that's what you like you and you like the you like to

106
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,680
take your time with your hair and take care of your hair that's all for you with

107
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:08,640
beards um I don't really have a preference on beard or not you know Senpai

108
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,120
Senpai's have been sending me a lot of questions on if I if I like beards beard

109
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,120
or not I think beards are fine I think mustaches are fine as long as you keep

110
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,640
them camped and well-maintained why because if you don't keep them nice and

111
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:34,080
clean and well-maintained kisses you're gonna get less kisses I'm sorry

112
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,800
you're gonna get less kisses

113
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:55,280
if there anything like the hair down there that I have and they come out real

114
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:05,120
prickly and polky when they grow back they go prickly and polky yeah I don't

115
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:23,720
want to kiss that so there you go Senpai you're wonderful

116
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:38,320
you're wonderful Cole hi has given you advice otherwise otherwise if you're so

117
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,880
tired of your hair laser it completely off that's what I did not my hair hair

118
00:25:44,880 --> 00:26:07,520
but like my armpits I said not my hair hair like my pits they're

119
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:23,600
laser it took me a long time though I have a lot of hair I saved a lot of

120
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,920
money for that or go through the most painful thing ever which is an

121
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:39,280
epilator an epilator it's a device which functions as a hair removal and if you

122
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:46,160
use that your hair will will removal will last long will last longer but will

123
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,880
hurt like a bitch because essentially it's about a hundred me tweezers ripping

124
00:26:50,880 --> 00:27:02,320
your hair out as once you can get one for your face just the pits how did it

125
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:10,400
feel at some parts it felt like there was like a little electric spark I was

126
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:20,840
like oh that's fine it's normal waxing not work Cole hi I'm kind of my skin's

127
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:33,240
really sensitive to the wax that's why I don't use it that's all it gets worse

128
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:47,160
every time okay next question let's say theoretically uh-huh I'm locked in a

129
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,520
cage and need to get out how do I do that asking for a Senpai

130
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:11,840
are you trying to get out Senpai are you trying to get out Senpai theoretically

131
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,360
no no no no no rhetorically asking for a friend that all means you that's all

132
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:25,320
you Senpai you are never leaving me understood there's no way out you are

133
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,480
stuck with me forever

134
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,880
forever and ever so there's no way out don't even try don't even try to ask

135
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:50,520
don't even try to pray you're here forever and you are mine and I fed you

136
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,280
and bathed you and given you all so many things that you could ever want I even

137
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:04,720
let you have your bionicles and you're you want to leave me

138
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:16,920
oh thank you thank you Misaka best I wanted to know if the bandage on your arm

139
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:24,080
goes all the way up to your armpit now I think it only I actually don't know I

140
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,400
think it only goes up to like the upper arm

141
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:45,720
so Senpai you will never leave me and that's final okay otherwise you'll be

142
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:59,320
asking for an Ex-Senpai an Ex-Senpai means that they're gone already okay okay

143
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,840
next question

144
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,400
hi mercy how do I fix my sleep schedule I'm basically nocturnal

145
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:20,640
oh thank you Miss Morrigan for the $1 you do theoretically I'm locked out of

146
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:30,600
the cage how do I get in this is a trick question um open the cage and get back

147
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,360
in done it walks from the outside

148
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:46,080
how do I fix my sleep schedule okay I'm going to assume this is if you are

149
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,880
watching me your sleep schedule is already fucked I'm sorry that's just how

150
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:59,600

151
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:10,800
fix your sleep schedule for like a job job or something what I did when I had

152
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:20,240
to wake up early mornings was that I wore myself out the the previous day

153
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,560
and then I was forced to fall asleep early be it exercise doing a bunch of

154
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:34,920
chores I'm going out for a hike wear yourself in and then you'll sleep like a

155
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,000

220
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:34,080
hi Mary see I have some questions that range from genuine to silly okay

221
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:50,400
is your hair naturally purple or is it dot hair die it's purple did you see my

222
00:44:50,400 --> 00:45:00,240
lorry video it's purple it's naturally purple you have any advice for blocking

223
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:09,120
out noise during your recording um I have a couple of advice for blocking out

224
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:17,760
noises some of which you may already know I actually have a little closet room

225
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,760
for my recording which is kind of surrounded by clothes which dampen the

226
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,600
sound so it's pretty much I'm recording in a closet for an open space like this

227
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:45,000
one or like for my ASMR um I put my I have a senpai's have generously gifted

228
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,880
me a senpai has generously gifted me a weighted not a weighted blanket sorry a

229
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,040
sound damp dampening blanket well well why did I say waited it's not a weighted

230
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:05,480
one sound dampening blanket I hang over at the side also my space is by the PC

231
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:15,760
is has these town folks so that they can absorb the reverberations from the wall

232
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:27,240
mm-hmm if you have a lack of those another way to record your audio in

233
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,560
order to make the sound happening is to put a blanket over your head and the

234
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:40,880
microphone and the use of the blanket will also absorb outside noise and you

235
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,440
can just go be like blah blah blah blah here for example I'll even do it right

236
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:52,040
now you might not hear a difference okay let's go into the blanket together

237
00:46:52,040 --> 00:47:01,960
senpai I draped blanket over and here you can hear there is no noise it's a

238
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:14,200
little bit more intimate but you can hear how everything's dampened right there

239
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:31,880
there that was just simply a blanket over the microphone

240
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:53,000
how do I do a good villain laugh a good villain laugh is to do with practice so

241
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,640
if you have but except for mine mine's kind of natural so if you have a good

242
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,480
villain laugh you can copy or try to imitate those that you have already

243
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:32,440
heard so some villain laughs that comes from upper the upper area back of your

244
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:59,840
throat in your chest that's kind of in your your throat pick one that suits you

245
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,120
and just go for it something that's calm comfortable and makes you just laugh

246
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,680
sometimes it sounds evil

247
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:27,040
what are some hurdles that prevent you from streaming full time well currently

248
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:36,320
this is kind of my full time but I will I will list some things that cause me some

249
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:44,280
up the bop bop bop bop bop bop bop give me a second I gotta I gotta mute for a

250
00:49:44,280 --> 00:50:00,720
second sorry I had to let out a burp so I just muted okay aren't I so nice to be

251
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:24,360
so considerate anyways first hurdle that prevents me from full-time streaming is

252
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:34,520
living with my parents living with my parents they're upstairs right now making

253
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:42,360
gilsa they're making gilsa right now it's pretty loud I'm glad that is not

254
00:50:42,360 --> 00:51:04,320
being picked up what kind of meat is it beef beef but essentially I have no

255
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,640
privacy the reason why I also stream at this time as well that I find ideal is

256
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:18,920
because Mama Papa kind of have no sense of personal space and boundaries because

257
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:25,280
I work online they kind of come in any time and just go can you handle this for

258
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:35,320
us right now and sometimes I'm just like I'm a little busy I'm a little busy the

259
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:52,560
type to open doors abruptly yep kind of yeah so um they're kind of the kind of

260
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:58,760
busy and it's kind of busy and so I don't have a lot of privacy and you know

261
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,760
Netflix tends to be more important than whatever I'm doing right now

262
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,920
oh it's my audio out already okay well I was I was told that okay they think that

263
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:24,960
mine was on Tuesdays now it looks like Mondays nevermind it's really funny oh by

264
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,840
the way my space has no doors the space that I'm currently in has no doors it's

265
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:39,800
kind of like an open space so that's why I do a lot of audio treatment stuff so

266
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:49,320
they just they can just like come down another one about hurdles that prevent

267
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,320
full-time streaming is well right now I'm doing full-time streaming but in order to

268
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:06,600
do it like as is there a particular way you keep them from coming in when you're

269
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:14,560
recording all it's all audios I'm in my closet I'm in my closet room so I'm

270
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,440
hidden from sight

271
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:31,560
another one would be just the cost because streaming streaming right away

272
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:39,800
does not always pay the bills it's a gradual thing that happens over time so

273
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:46,640
let's say you know your first month for example my first week right now would

274
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:56,120
that pay the bills right now and no you know if my second like maybe my second

275
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:05,360
week okay the the cost is is is going down because I'm getting more more money

276
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:11,840
in okay it's it's easier third week okay things are coming getting in more maybe

277
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:22,680
sec maybe fourth week maybe by fourth week maybe I have maybe I have have maybe

278
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:33,120
like enough to pay for bills I'll be real with you Senpai let's take off the

279
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:40,720
kayfabe for a second and I'll talk about my previous streaming streaming history

280
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:49,680
and I will tell you I will tell you some things I will tell you about splits and

281
00:54:49,680 --> 00:55:01,400
stuff okay twitch splits is 50 50 okay 50 50 but it's the easiest and most

282
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:07,880
accessible thing and the quickest way to get monetized for YouTube monetization

283
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,280
you need you need and we're talking about only the first step of monetization

284
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:21,800
4,000 watch hours or 1 million short views plus 1000 no I think they changed

285
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:29,400
it 500 subscribers after that it goes through a manual review okay it takes a

286
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:38,960
long time as someone who is small and it doesn't help that if your videos even

287
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,400
though you're calculating yes I should have this many this many views to make

288
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,600
the 4,000 YouTube will not sometimes count it

289
00:55:53,520 --> 00:56:00,920
let's see thank you for the $20 a nyanyi mesh it sounds like you need more

290
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:09,240
I want to work for for it though so I will I will be very truthful I will be

291
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:17,080
very truthful okay what is culling does that play into culling is when YouTube

292
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,680
believes that the following and subscribers are bots and they start

293
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:28,280
deleting them YouTube on the other hand I believe YouTube let me look it up first

294
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,040
so I don't give you wrong information

295
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,040
you

296
00:56:49,920 --> 00:57:01,360
what's my revenue share blah blah blah okay shorts shorts are 45%

297
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:09,800
what's super chat

298
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,280
super chat is 7030

299
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:39,280
Super Chat is 7030.

300
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:57,280
Super chats are 7030 meaning YouTube will take 30%.

301
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:25,280
When I was full time streaming on Twitch, my old fans gave me $200.

302
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:37,280
I would get only $100 a month.

303
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:57,280
One time I had a birthday celebration.

304
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:17,280
I only got $250 in the end.

305
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:37,280
Now imagine this.

306
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:47,280
I would say this as a streamer.

307
00:59:47,280 --> 01:00:07,280
If you don't get 500 subs,

308
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:33,280
you do not get the split.

309
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:53,280
If you get partner, your split is the same.

310
01:00:53,280 --> 01:01:13,280
Unless you meet a certain threshold of subs, you do not get the split.

311
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:33,280
If you get money, you get nothing.

312
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:53,280
Most companies are with YouTube unless they have a deal.

313
01:01:53,280 --> 01:02:13,280
This is public information and my own experience with it.

314
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:33,280
If you get monetization faster on Twitch, you might not even reach it on YouTube.

315
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:43,280
You might not be able to get partnership because it's very difficult.

316
01:02:43,280 --> 01:03:03,280
If it's 4,000 watch hours, that's for one year.

317
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:23,280
It's a milestone to be a YouTube partner and monetize on YouTube.

318
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:29,280
I'm proud of what VLR has done.

319
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:41,280
Imagine I have the most seniority in terms of streaming.

320
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:51,280
In the three years of which I have been streaming as a VTuber, I have never gone monetization or even close to monetization on YouTube.

321
01:03:51,280 --> 01:04:01,280
I did get monetization on Twitch though.

322
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:11,280
It's even harder to hit partner than to get monetized on YouTube.

323
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:37,280
Because you need a certain amount of hours streamed and hitting exactly or more than 78 average viewers.

324
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:43,280
That is a near impossible number or a number and that is not including rates.

325
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:53,280
You cannot have that number with rates, you cannot have that number with collabs, you cannot have that number with anything else.

326
01:04:53,280 --> 01:05:09,280
Which is why, doesn't 78 average viewers put you on the top 1% of streamers? Wrong.

327
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:21,280
Senpai, you must know this. Just at 20 viewers, 20 average viewers, you are the top 1% of Twitch already.

328
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:39,280
For 78 viewers, you are the top 0.01%.

329
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:49,280
And that's how it is.

330
01:05:49,280 --> 01:06:03,280
And that is what most of the hurdle is for streaming full time.

331
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:15,280
As for what is the best way to probably support me, Patreon is probably one of the best ways.

332
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:25,280
And YouTube membership slash YouTube super chats will be the least amount taken.

333
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:31,280
As well as tips as well, if you want to just donate through stream elements is probably the best.

334
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:39,280
Merch will be good as well.

335
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,280
So any little support is fine.

336
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:51,280
But those are the hurdles that prevent a lot of people from streaming full time.

337
01:06:51,280 --> 01:07:01,280
To be honest, I don't know a lot of the networking what's better and what's better.

338
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:07,280
Because I just kind of stream, right?

339
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:13,280
And management takes care of all that stuff.

340
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:25,280
YouTube membership would probably be one of the good ways to support and super chats and Patreon and anything.

341
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,280
And if you can't afford any of that, just watching our streams is just fine as well.

342
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:37,280
Watching our streams, interacting, drawing fan art, anything to support the company is great.

343
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:49,280
It worked really hard and which is why hopefully everyone in VLOR can become full time streamers and just to entertain you.

344
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,280
Oh yeah, and clip as well.

345
01:07:51,280 --> 01:08:07,280
If you clip, there's a chance that it will be probably edited by an editor and put into like shorts or a compilation.

346
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:21,280
You'll literally like comment hitting the bell. That is literally how you do it.

347
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,280
That's literally how you support.

348
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:35,280
But that is why there's a lot of people who have additional jobs or have something else to supplement the streaming.

349
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:49,280
Because of those hurdles.

350
01:08:49,280 --> 01:09:05,280
And if I believe what I read about what YouTube gives as they're like how to grow your channel.

351
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:11,280
We are to believe that comments boost the algorithm for more eyes to be seen.

352
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:23,280
More subscribers also gives more eyes and a sense of trust as well as boosting your content.

353
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:29,280
And then likes and then they look at likes to two views.

354
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:39,280
So for example, if for example, I believe this is the case, I don't know how accurate it is because it's YouTube.

355
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:47,280
But comment on VOD specifically, it can be anything, it can be anything.

356
01:09:47,280 --> 01:10:01,280
But if YouTube sees that you have tons of views, tons of views, but no likes or very little likes, they're like people hated that.

357
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,280
People hated that so we're not going to push it.

358
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,280
Kind of things like that.

359
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:25,280
I'm not fully aware of the mysteries of the YouTube algorithm because the real YouTube algorithm is a beast.

360
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:41,280
And if I knew how to abuse it, everyone would abuse it.

361
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,280
No, seriously, I have no idea how it works.

362
01:10:45,280 --> 01:11:03,280
Same thing with Twitter. If I grew quite a bit on Twitter and I have no idea how I did it, I have no idea how I did it and I'm a little scared because I literally have no idea what I did.

363
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:11,280
So yeah.

364
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:29,280
So yeah, everything is really confusing and I don't really know, but I can tell you why there are some hurdles that prevent people from full time streaming is especially the splits, the splits, especially on Twitch.

365
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:50,280
If you're looking at your kind of like smaller indie Vtuber, that is most likely why they don't stream full time.

366
01:11:50,280 --> 01:12:13,280
But I have no idea. I have no idea. Okay, and any recommendation for a good iPad. Find one that fits you and have a looser elastic because if the elastic pinches against your face, it's going to hurt and leave a little dent.

367
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:39,280
And you're going to be embarrassed so you never take your iPad off. Make sure the elastic is quite loose on you but still holding on.

368
01:12:40,280 --> 01:13:00,280
Yeah, I had to wear an iPad because I got pink eye once in school and it was too tight and like the next day, the strap was still there.

369
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:08,280
The strap from the iPad was still there.

370
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:16,280
Yeah. Not because you were a tunie.

371
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:27,280
Well, part of it, I thought that looked cool, but also, yeah.

372
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:35,280
Yeah, I got pink eye once so now, so I know how it is.

373
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:44,280
So yeah, the pressure of the elastic or in cloth, if it's too tight, can be really painful.

374
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:53,280
But I think it looks cool.

375
01:13:53,280 --> 01:14:12,280
Okay, next question. I hope that helped with some questions about, what's the word, why some people don't get full time streamer and for me it's that, oh, hold on, I didn't put my theme on.

376
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:22,280
Is it okay? I forgot to put on my theme. Ah, there we go.

377
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:28,280
Okay, okay. I forgot my BGM. That was my bad.

378
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:32,280
My precious Kohai, thank you for being you, Senpai's.

379
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:39,280
Days are happier when you're in them. I hope you're being as kind to yourself as you are Senpai.

380
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:49,280
Oops. Oops, that's my bad. This was a compliment that got shifted in. That shifted in. That was my, that was my pad.

381
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:59,280
Oops, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But thank you. Thank you, Senpai. I accidentally saved this into the list. That was definitely my bad, but I really appreciated.

382
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:11,280
I'm kind of hard on myself, Senpai. I'm kind of hard on myself, but I'll do my best to be prouder of myself in my achievements.

383
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:18,280
Thank you. Very good advice.

384
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:33,280
This was actually truly an accident that this slipped in. I was trying to save a bunch of advice questions, but I think I accidentally saved this one, but thank you. I really appreciate it.

385
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:42,280
I'm tired. Come next to me so we can cuddle. Wait, what is this also?

386
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:54,280
I need to review these questions. I need to review these. Why did some of the ones that are not questions mixed in?

387
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:06,280
Yes, we can cuddle.

388
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:14,280
I'm so scared. I'm so scared. What the next one's going to be?

389
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,280
Okay.

390
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:31,280
My coworker goals on 4chan is insensitive and may or may not have a crush on me. Do I extort him or reject him? Serious answers only.

391
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:40,280
You take his phone number and you put it in a bathroom stall and then you say, hey, great time here. And then you order 70 pizzas to their location.

392
01:16:40,280 --> 01:17:04,280
Different from different companies and make them fight each other, but also extortion 100%.

393
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:09,280
I don't think that's legal, Kohai.

394
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:30,280
What did I write in my thing? All advice are for jokes and giggles and hee hee ha ha. Please do not take them seriously. All advice takers are responsible for their own actions, regardless of what advice has been given. You're welcome.

395
01:17:34,280 --> 01:18:01,280
I don't actually know. To be honest, I don't actually, it's like, wow, you really hate 4chan users. I don't hate 4chan users. I just don't have a great trust in the form.

396
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:17,280
Are they called forms? I don't use this site, but I do have occasionally my friends, my gal pals and my friends will go on and they'll be like, okay, let's see what people are saying about you.

397
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:42,280
And I'll leave the nasty icky stuff away. And yeah. So I don't actually go on there. I have my friends. Occasionally, some people might give advice, but I rather not go on there since I'm a sensitive little baby.

398
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:52,280
But yeah, he's all in shits and giggles, you know? Next.

399
01:18:52,280 --> 01:19:10,280
It's probably like Reddit. And guess what? I don't go on Reddit either, except for, um, what's the word? I don't go on Reddit either, except for like, um, for example, I'm like, oh, how, for like tech advice, how do I make my lights go on?

400
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:23,280
Does that make sense?

401
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:36,280
So I look if it's like, so it's either tech people on YouTube or tech people on Reddit. They're very good.

402
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:53,280
So yeah, that's, um, that's the thing. Okay, I hope this isn't too personal, but when you draw blow bubbles, okay, okay, I haven't blown bubbles in a long time.

403
01:19:53,280 --> 01:20:06,280
Do you watch the bubbles fall to the ground and think about how falling bubbles are like a metaphor for beauty and fragility of life as you said shed a single tear or do you be popping all of them bubbles?

404
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:18,280
Um, I kind of pop all of them. I pop all the bubbles or I let them let them float off and see where they go. And that's it.

405
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:34,280
No, seriously, I don't think too much on it because bubbles are just like us. Not a permanent thing in life. You're welcome.

406
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:58,280
You blow them like, you know, from the bubbles or or you can like wave the wand, the like wand and then it makes bubbles too.

407
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:09,280
This isn't really a question, is it? It must have gone mixed in. This is not really like, uh, this isn't really like a advice thing.

408
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:20,280
I slipped in. Oops. I swear I went through them and I guess some stuff slipped in. Don't let me do this when I'm like super tired.

409
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:37,280
Free Q&A. Okay, let's break kayfabe for a brief second. All right. All right. I've had a kami oh she for two plus years.

410
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:51,280
Okay, okay. Don't break. Don't break. Don't break. And I'm very dedicated to her. She has got me through some extremely rough times and I owe her a bigger depth than I could, could hope to ever pay back.

411
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:56,280
Unfortunately, her streaming times barely line up with my work schedule anymore.

412
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:01,280
Recently, I discovered you. I really enjoy your general vibe and sense of humor.

413
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:17,280
I appreciate the entire experience and am really drawn to your choice of games. Simply put, I genuinely enjoy you for entirely different reasons and have rarely clicked with a creator so quickly in my four plus years in VTuber rabbit hole.

414
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:26,280
So my conundrum is this. I know that I'm not portraying my kami oh she by watching and enjoying you but deep down it feels like as though I am.

415
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:34,280
How do you suggest I resolve this internal struggle without giving up either of you? Apologies that this is too heavy or real of a question.

416
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:40,280
I hope I loved your take today. I love your take on this. Thank you. Much love.

417
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:45,280
Ugh, Petrina, what you eating is bad. But, okay, okay, okay.

418
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:49,280
Ignoring the fact that I want to be the favorite here.

419
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,280
Ignoring the fact that I want to be the favorite here.

420
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,280
And that it should only be me.

421
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,280
Let me get my friend. Let me get my friend.

422
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,280
Let me get my friend and title.

423
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,280
Let me get my friend and title.

424
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,280
Oh no, another question.

425
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,280
Another question on this.

426
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,280
Wow, I think you guys are making mercy.

427
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,280
Neat.

428
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,280
I think you are making mercy. Neat.

429
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,280
You snitched on me. Neat.

430
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,280
Last time maybe you shouldn't have been a little bitch.

431
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:57,280
Anyway, let's talk about Ostees.

432
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:09,280
Ostees are your number one, your favorite things in idol culture.

433
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:16,280
But anyways, like all things change. And sometimes you have to accept that.

434
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:20,280
And as all creatures, we have to accept it as well.

435
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:32,280
One example, in your life, sometimes, are you always friends with your best friends?

436
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:39,280
Perhaps over time, your best friend and you will grow my distance on your part.

437
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,280
And that is just a fact of life.

438
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,280
Change is happening in your life.

439
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,280
Things, for example, when chips may die,

440
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,280
and others will begin.

441
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:08,280
So please do not feel you are completely indebted and into complete loyalty.

442
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:15,280
Because as your Oshi, your Oshi will also view changes.

443
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:19,280
And view ish, and also in yourself.

444
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:26,280
And you too will also view new new Ostees all the time.

445
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:31,280
And you may move on, and that is just the way of idols.

446
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:36,280
It is unfortunate, but it is a thing that happens.

447
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:44,280
For example, if you have a friend or a partner,

448
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:49,280
and your Oshi may graduate,

449
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:57,280
and you can keep your Oshi in your heart forever, forever.

450
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:10,280
But if, for example, you find that your Oshi has pivoted

451
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:17,280
different genres that you do not, that you do not vibe with,

452
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,280
and perhaps it is time to move on from an Oshi,

453
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,280
and take them for their time that they have spent with you.

454
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,280
But perhaps it is time for both you and them to go on.

455
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:45,280
Well, I believe that if you believe that you are between your Oshi,

456
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,280
then you can continue to watch your Oshi.

457
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:54,280
But remember that your Oshi can go through changes,

458
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:59,280
and that changes sometimes means having to say goodbye.

459
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:05,280
Now I will bring back Mashi.

460
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:31,280
Oops, where the heck is my window? There it is.

461
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,280
I hope, yeah, I had time to cool off. I had time to cool off.

462
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:46,280
I had time to cool off, so now, so now, I hope you got your answered question.

463
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:49,280
I hope your question got answered.

464
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:58,280
Yeah, I found a magical cat.

465
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:05,280
I found a magical cat just the other day, and then we became besties.

466
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,280
I feel like a magical girl.

467
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:16,280
Okay, here's the next question.

468
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,280
Ugh.

469
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:26,280
Do your parents know? No, it's a secret, okay? You keep it a secret, right?

470
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:36,280
Dear Mercy, I need life advice on two things.

471
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,280
One, I'd like to build Gunpla, so for my next project,

472
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,280
should I do two small models or one big model?

473
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,280
And two, what should I have for lunch tomorrow?

474
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:51,280
If you don't, don't, don't answer, I will starve instead. Love you, SMPI.

475
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,280
Wow.

476
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,280
Okay.

477
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:05,280
Personally, I feel like doing maybe two smaller models will be easier than doing one big model.

478
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:16,280
And for lunch, have Gyoza, I guess?

479
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:24,280
I'm out of food thoughts because Mama, Mama Mercy is making Gyoza.

480
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,280
And I guess you're going to have Gyoza, too.

481
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:44,280
It's empty, only Gyoza. You don't understand. The smell of the Gyoza is really good.

482
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,280
It's really good, SMPI.

483
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,280
Where do I find Gyoza?

484
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:59,280
Oh, check any, check any like place.

485
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,280
Oh, what's another alternative name for Gyoza?

486
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,280
You can find it at like Chinese places, too.

487
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:07,280
Dumplings, right? Or pot stickies.

488
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:14,280
They're also called pot stickies, or meat dumplings, or just dumplings.

489
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,280
You can probably find them at like a Chinese restaurant.

490
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:23,280
Or if there's like a specialty Japanese place, you can get like the Gyoza.

491
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,280
Or you can make it.

492
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:37,280
Also Walmart, and I think like most grocery stores have like some instant one as well.

493
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:46,280
So yeah, there you go. Thank you, SMPI, for sending it in.

494
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:58,280
How'd I get a girlfriend and am I a good SMPI? You're already, I'm already your girlfriend, SMPI.

495
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:05,280
And yes, you are a good SMPI, as long as you're not a troll, or like someone who's pretending to be a SMPI.

496
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,280
You're welcome.

497
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:20,280
What is the airspeed velocity of an unlaid and swallow? European or African? Or even Asian?

498
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,280
Next question.

499
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:40,280
What is the minimum of cleaning products that I should use in the shower? Should I keep sticking to three in one shampoo? I will fucking kill you.

500
01:31:40,280 --> 01:32:00,280
First of all, for, I'm assuming if it's a three in one, this is a question for from a male SMPI.

501
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:25,280
I'm assuming four male SMPIs. I highly recommend body wash one, two shampoo, three conditioner, and a face wash.

502
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,280
In total, you will have four products.

503
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:46,280
What's one, what's wrong with three in ones? The reason why three in ones do not work is because your scalp skin and your skin skin are completely different.

504
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:57,280
So if you use your body wash, it may be too harsh on your scalp, or it might be too light on your skin. Simple.

505
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,280
It's very simple, really.

506
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:14,280
That's three products too many. Then don't take my advice and die. And be disliked by.

507
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:40,280
About two in ones. I still don't recommend two in ones. I still don't recommend two in ones. If you want, if you want, I will give you some picks, because I helped Papa Mercy pick some products.

508
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:50,280
It's very cheap. It's very cheap to get, to get shampoo and conditioner. Whatever works for you.

509
01:33:54,280 --> 01:34:03,280
Okay, whatever works for you, whatever your hair issue is, if you get a lot of dandruff, use a dandruff shampoo and use a matching, the matching conditioner with it.

510
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:12,280
The shampoo strips, the, okay, shampoo strips conditioner brings back the moisture, understood?

511
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:30,280
Because if you just use shampoo, it will dry out your hair. It will dry out your hair, which is great if you are a very oily person, if you're an oily person, maybe just stripping is all you need.

512
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:50,280
Second, second is the conditioner. Conditioner, if you find that your hair is too dry or your scalp is beginning to flay, not, I wouldn't recommend putting it on your scalp, but for males, yes, I would probably recommend putting it on your scalp.

513
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:54,280
If you find your scalp is flaking too much, try a conditioner with it.

514
01:34:55,280 --> 01:35:14,280
Next is a body wash. A body wash will help you strip, strip yourself. Actually, I recommend five products. Sorry. We'll strip a dead skin cell off of dead skin cells and basically sweat and stuff.

515
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:29,280
It's very cheap. I believe the best soap you can buy is like a dove bar. A dove bar will help with a bit of adding a bit of moisture as well.

516
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:42,280
But if you're super manly and you can't stand the girly dove stuff, I recommend an Irish spring bar soap.

517
01:35:45,280 --> 01:36:02,280
Second is a face wash because your face is not the same as your skin. Your face has a different type of texture and sensitivity. It has more pores and there's delicate areas around your face and eyes.

518
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:28,280
So you need a face wash. I recommend, um, I recommend, uh, there was, I found out the body shop was shutting down. I would have recommended you the seaweed wash from, um,

519
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:40,280
from, from, uh, the body shop, but it's no longer there. So, uh, there's a, give me a second, give me a second. There's another brand that I really like.

520
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:54,280
I think this is great for men as well because I feel like it is, uh, it is a wash that a strip that makes you less shiny and helps clears out your pores and makes you feel nice and clean.

521
01:36:54,280 --> 01:37:09,280
So the, um, wash was avenue, avenue, avenue, avenue, a wash.

522
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:32,280
It is a huge little thing is bath and body works a good place. Now, bath and body works, I think, uh, sucks, sucks, except for their sense. Uh, it sucks. Uh, so this one's called, excuse my French, it's going to be terrible.

523
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:45,280
But, um, avenue, cleanance, cleansing gel. This is great. It's a huge bottle. It will last you forever. You can buy it for like super cheap.

524
01:37:45,280 --> 01:38:14,280
Um, and I recommend a lotion for men. After your shower, put on some lotion. It will make you feel good and it will keep bringing back some moisture into the skin that you have already, um,

525
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:27,280
gotten rid of. So, uh, simple lotion that most people use will be a Vaseline lotion.

526
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:50,280
So I use their cocoa, cocoa radiant. Uh, but you can use anything is fine. You can use, uh, like the aloe vera hydration, advanced repair, whatever, just bring back some moisture in your skin.

527
01:38:50,280 --> 01:39:11,280
And that's it. That is Mercy Modisse. How to, uh, how to get bitches. Tea tree shampoo is good. What about Walmart? Walmart is, you can find all these products at Walmart.

528
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:27,280
Where does the lotion go? Arms, legs, chest, back, if you can reach. You can buy all these products at Walmart. I am not lying to you. Like all these products can be like maybe a dollar.

529
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:48,280
So the most you might spend is like, if you use my recommendation, it's going to be a little bit more expensive for the face wash. But if you get a regular face wash at whatever is at, uh, at Walmart, then maybe your five products can be $5.

530
01:39:48,280 --> 01:40:02,280
There's no Walmart in Europe. Uh, in that case, go to a, where do they sell skincare in Europe? Pharmacy? I think they might sell them at pharmacy. Hmm.

531
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:47,280
I feel like, even if you aren't going to get ladies, I feel like you are going to have, you're going to feel very, you're going to feel much better. You're going to feel much better after you take a shower and you're going to feel like, what?

532
01:40:48,280 --> 01:41:17,280
Oh, I feel good. Where does short hair need conditioner? I said you don't have to use conditioner. Um, but if it's your scalp does, if your scalp does have like really bad, um, if you really have like bad dandruff or you're finding yourself like, um, like you might have like

533
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:44,280
super flakiness or dryness in your hair, uh, try a conditioner. It's, it's, it's, um, it's not needed. I technically don't really use conditioner. I use conditioner sometimes. In fact, I, instead of a shaving cream, instead of a shaving cream, if I shave, I just use conditioner because it softens the hair anyways and it's easy to shave.

534
01:41:44,280 --> 01:42:10,280
You can save your, save money using conditioner as well. I use conditioner and my hair is still dry. Try a different conditioner. I don't know what type you're using.

535
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:30,280
Okay. And I will like you a lot if you try these because I want my supplies to feel confident and or maybe too much shampoo. Uh, shampoo in your hand should be only like, I think for men only about, well, I can't use that reference because then that doesn't have it.

536
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:57,280
Um, a dollop, just like, just in the middle of your palm. So that should be enough. I think, um, if you, honestly, it's really easy to save on these type of things. And I feel like for guys, they tend to have less sensitive skin.

537
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:14,280
And the most problems I think for guys skin, if I can recall, is just oiliness. So it's easy to do like that.

538
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:35,280
And soapy use instead of body wash soap, soap and body wash will be used intermittently. So for example, a bar soap will be just fine to use as a body soap. So like I said, Irish spring or a dove, I highly recommend dove body bar.

539
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:59,280
Because it brings some moisture back, but also helps get rid of the, um, the, um, the dead skin, the dead skin and sweat. And long thick hair adult doesn't cut it. Uh, if you have long thick hair, um, a palm full will be fine, a palm full will be fine.

540
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:18,280
But also for long thick hair, I highly recommend, um, cause, uh, Tressame, the brand Tressame.

541
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:30,280
Irish spring makes my skin feels waxy. Try a dove bar then. I, I highly recommend the dove bar more than the Irish spring bar.

542
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:42,280
I use Tressame myself. And I will tell you, um, my hair, I know it doesn't look like this cause my hair is pretty thin at the edges here, like paper thin.

543
01:44:42,280 --> 01:45:01,280
But my hair is actually, uh, really thick. It used to be as thick as barbed wire. And I switched to a clarifying shampoo, um, because it gets pretty oily. And it, it, uh, helped quite a bit.

544
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:20,280
It used to be as thick as barbed wire. Like it got really bad. So, uh, so, uh, I actually went to a salon and asked the salon, um, my hair person to be like, what the fuck do I do, man? This is torturing me.

545
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:32,280
Um, they were like, okay, what brand have you been using? And then I was like, okay, I've been using this brand, this brand, and this brand. And they were like, no, that's no good.

546
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:55,280
And I said, uh, for a direct store brand, try Tressame. And I said, okay. And I said, okay. And so I used, uh, just, I used just the Tressame shampoo. Lately, I've been seeing that my hair has actually gotten dry at the ends.

547
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:24,280
So, so I used, um, so I ended up using, um, a, what do you call it? I ended up using conditioner. I ended up using a conditioner. That's, I think it's apple cider and apple cider conditioner to help with the oiliness as well.

548
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:45,280
Um, I use Tressame and then for my oily hair, I also, I also have to blow dry it at the blow dry my hair. It's so long, but it can get really greasy. So the blow dry will also make it dry out a little bit more.

549
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,280
So that's what I use for my hair.

550
01:46:55,280 --> 01:47:09,280
But yeah, experiment with things. If you're fine, listen, if you, if you're fine, if you're fine with using your three in one, fine, just use your three in one. Okay.

551
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:21,280
It doesn't matter. It doesn't really matter. It's your choice. I don't, I don't force your hand. Well, I do force your hand sometimes, but but really it's your choice.

552
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:39,280
It's your choice, but if you like cleaner hair, if you want to feel your skin immaculate and stuff, and you want to feel more moisture, I recommend five steps.

553
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:51,280
I recommend the five steps, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair, not fair hair, face wash, lotion, that's it.

554
01:47:52,280 --> 01:48:10,280
I do admit I hate three in ones because I admit I hate three in ones because your scalp, your face, and your body does not have the same chemistry.

555
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:21,280
Yeah, you can still use it. I just, I'll silently judge you. Next question.

556
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:34,280
What's the proper way to prepare your cereal? Some believe you should pour cereal into the bowl first. Others believe that pouring milk first is the best method.

557
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:56,280
Thoughts, please help me. I'm really hungry. Milk first. No, seriously, it's milk first. It's milk first. Milk first so your cereal doesn't get soggy. You can take your time eating it.

558
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:33,280
Well, if you want it soggy, then put cereal first. But I don't like soggy cereal, so I actually, what I do is I put the milk in first and then I take my Pikachu spoon because it makes me feel like I'm still youthful and still watching cartoons as I eat my cereal.

559
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:43,280
I put, I like pour, I might even pour sometimes like one spoonful at a time because I don't like how soggy it gets.

560
01:49:43,280 --> 01:50:08,280
Anyways, people always say, why do you take so long? Well, I'm telling you, sometimes they're stuck at the bottom and it gets soggy.

561
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:20,280
Or you can eat the cereal and then, yeah, you can eat the cereal and then take a sip of milk. Easy.

562
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:49,280
There you go. Next question. Wow, people are cancelling me just for that. So many people are saying that.

563
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:56,280
How many days acceptable to be wearing the same underwear? Keep in mind, I don't sweat much.

564
01:50:56,280 --> 01:51:05,280
As long as you want and it doesn't, guess what? Underwear doesn't disintegrate. So you can keep wearing it as long as you can stand it.

565
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:29,280
If you can smell your balls or your cooch, then maybe it's time to wash.

566
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:47,280
There you go. What's the longest you've gone, Mercy? It's embarrassing, but I've gone a month without showering.

567
01:51:47,280 --> 01:52:12,280
I was very depressed. I was very depressed at that time. Please tell me you're lying. No.

568
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:28,280
That was probably the most depressed I've ever, I was ever.

569
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:48,280
But I ended up, the most I go now is probably a week and that's it. That's actually kind of the norm.

570
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:13,280
When was your last shower? Three days ago. We're still good.

571
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:39,280
We're still good. I don't sweat that much either. I don't sweat that much. I think the water's back on, I think. Yeah, we're good.

572
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:55,280
You're schooling us on showers? I use a lot, okay? I school you on shower because I care about you, Senpai. But even if I don't shower for a week, my skin is still perfect, my hair is still perfect.

573
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:10,280
I'm just saying, it's still perfect. I'm still perfect.

574
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:33,280
My hair still looks like I got out of a salon, okay?

575
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:49,280
Simple. That's because it's stiff. It's not stiff. It's super soft. If you give me pets daily, Senpai, you would understand how soft it is.

576
01:54:49,280 --> 01:55:18,280
Do you know how long it took me? I just told you, my hair used to be barbed wire. My hair used to be barbed wire, and then I just found the perfect thing.

577
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:36,280
Anyways, next question. Can't decide what should be the name of my cat. My current cat is named Catherine, or just cat for short, and she needs a pal, so I was thinking of adopting a new cat.

578
01:55:36,280 --> 01:56:05,280
You named your cat cat? You named your cat cat? Catherine with a C, sure. We can play Catherine like the game.

579
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:32,280
You're going to name your cat cat? Kitty? You're going to have cat and kitty. This reminds me of a post I saw about families be naming their kid Rex, but their dog Joseph.

580
01:56:36,280 --> 01:57:05,280
Well, you have tons of names to choose, but if your cat's name is cat, you can try your other cat to be kitty.

581
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:17,280
No, I'm serious, maybe.

582
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:38,280
I mean, like if it's already Catherine, kitty is already like Catherine with a C, so I guess kitty is still the same thing.

583
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:45,280
Name it cat, like cat cat? Okay, that's kind of cute. Actually, that's cute. That's cute, sure.

584
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:57,280
Kit and cat, what do you think? I think that's fine.

585
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:13,280
Yeah, kit, kit and cat, right? So it's like, if you say kit cat together, and then they're like, yeah, that's, that's cute, right? I feel like that was a good name. Whoever suggested that? Yeah, let's go with that. You name your next cat kit.

586
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:31,280
Coffee or green tea? I prefer green tea.

587
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:51,280
I prefer green tea. I don't like drinking coffee. I think it tastes, doesn't taste great. It's too bitter, but I like green tea. Coffee! Any tea tonight? Oh, yeah, I did. Oh, shoot, I don't remember what tea I made, though.

588
01:58:51,280 --> 01:59:10,280
I don't like the taste of, I don't like the taste of coffee, unless it's like extra sweet, and it can barely be called coffee. Like, I guess.

589
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:21,280
No, wait, hold on, let me sniff it. It's apple cinnamon again. The tea I have is apple cinnamon again.

590
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:37,280
Why are we at an English word of the day? Conundrum. Conundrum. Why the conundrum?

591
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:53,280
So, for example, the most coffee, I think, I think most empires figured out, figured out that I'm Canadian. Okay, so the only other coffee I like is an ice cap from Tim Hortons.

592
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:16,280
Yep, sorry.

593
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:30,280
So, yeah, I don't like coffee. I don't like coffee.

594
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:50,280
I think most empires figured it out really, really easily. Why are all VTubers Canadian? I don't know. I don't know. Like, literally, I don't know.

595
02:00:50,280 --> 02:01:14,280
I don't know. I just wanted to be here and with my senpais, and I'm going to just guess everyone else stole my idea.

596
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:29,280
That's it. Yeah. So, it doesn't really matter. I think everyone else just stole my idea.

597
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:43,280
Tea is, I like tea better. I will drink nothing but tea. I don't put anything in my tea. I think the flavor is fine as it is.

598
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:57,280
The apple cinnamon tea? I didn't get it from Tim Hortons. I have it from a brand called Stash.

599
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:04,280
Does that mean we get Tim Hortons once a month too? Everyone fights for the Timbits? I'm kind of allergic too, so.

600
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:13,280
Snash? No, it's Stash. Stash, S-T-A-S-H.

601
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:23,280
Hi, since you're Canadian, what's your Tim's order? Ice cap with a whole wheat bagel and cream cheese.

602
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:47,280
Sometimes, if I'm feeling a little frisky, I'll ask for a Boston cream.

603
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:56,280
Actually, Tim Hortons donuts are the only donuts I can eat. I can eat their yeast donuts because they don't contain eggs.

604
02:02:56,280 --> 02:03:05,280
But if they're cake donuts, if they have cake donuts, I cannot eat them. Which is why I can't have Timbits because all the Timbits are made together.

605
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:28,280
So the Timbits are kind of all mixed in, so I can't have Timbits.

606
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:39,280
Intaminated with eggs? Yeah. There's a high chance that I always ask for the ones that are the furthest from touching other donuts.

607
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:45,280
If there's a donut that's touching another one, I try to avoid that donut.

608
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:53,280
So sometimes I'll get like a maple cream one instead of Boston cream if the Boston cream is too close to the cake donuts.

609
02:03:53,280 --> 02:04:05,280
Or I ask them to use a different tong.

610
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:20,280
I like Poutine. I do like Poutine. And small amounts. I'm not like a huge Poutine person.

611
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:26,280
So yeah.

612
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:30,280
I like Poutine. I do.

613
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:37,280
Next question. How can I be more confident around others?

614
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:45,280
Develop your ego so far beyond people that nothing can faze you.

615
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:56,280
What's Poutine? It is a Canadian specialty. It is essentially fries or chips in other countries.

616
02:04:56,280 --> 02:05:19,280
I like the UK or Australia, we call them chips, with cheese curds and gravy. It is kind of like street food.

617
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:35,280
Yes, remember my story as well. But essentially, how do you become confident around others?

618
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:44,280
It's a thing to work on. It's a thing to work on. I can tell you my confidence got smushed to heck.

619
02:05:44,280 --> 02:06:05,280
But when I was a very confident girl, I just always told myself that I was the best.

620
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:11,280
I was the best. People will love me. If they don't love me, they're weird.

621
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:20,280
And then I got my ass kicked. By ass kicked, I mean like I got Meadow Illinois.

622
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:28,280
Sounds like a mess. You don't eat it with your hands. You eat it with like a fork.

623
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:40,280
I like regular fries for Poutine. You are the best though. I still wish I had that confidence I had back then.

624
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:51,280
I lost it because of some stuff. I am a really shy person. I have trouble talking with others. I haven't made any new friends in a year.

625
02:06:51,280 --> 02:07:05,280
Would you have any advice on how I can? I feel like my senpais have very similar problems.

626
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:11,280
I feel like my senpais have very similar problems.

627
02:07:12,280 --> 02:07:28,280
Okay, this is going to sound bad. But the best way to talk to someone and to be a good listener is to act.

628
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:36,280
This is stealing from a book. This is stealing from a book called How to Win Friends and Influence People.

629
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:52,280
Listen carefully to what people say. Respond to what they say. Oh, to interest in what they're talking about.

630
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:59,280
And do stuff. Try on error. This is going to take a lot of confidence.

631
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:08,280
But next time you go out to an event, look to the next person next to you and be like, hi, my name is Blank. Nice to meet you.

632
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:16,280
I'm really looking forward to whatever event you're at.

633
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:26,280
It's going to be a lot of work. Our submission is closed. I have quite a few to go through as well.

634
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:45,280
Honestly, if you can make friends online, you can make friends in real life.

635
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:51,280
I actually have trouble making friends online than I can in real life, I guess.

636
02:08:51,280 --> 02:09:03,280
The first step is hardest. If you go to a convention, if you want to talk to someone and maybe you don't have a topic to talk about,

637
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:08,280
be like, hey, I don't know if you're at a convention.

638
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:15,280
Hey, I noticed you have this on your phone. Do you like this character?

639
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:24,280
And if it's just a simple thing, if they don't seem like they want to talk to you, just be like, oh, okay, well, I have something to do now.

640
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:32,280
At your round sometime. Bye. Get out of there.

641
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:48,280
Get out of there.

642
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:54,280
Get out of there. But if you are interested in meeting people, show genuine interest in the other person.

643
02:09:54,280 --> 02:10:04,280
Don't just be like, me, me, me, me, so show genuine interest in the other person and be like, oh yeah, I'd like, oh yeah, let's chat more.

644
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:11,280
Oh my gosh. Hope to see you again soon. And if you want, you can be like, oh yeah, do you have like a discord?

645
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:18,280
But don't be like, don't be. Last time I went to a convention, don't be the guy who's like, where do you live?

646
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:26,280
What hotel are you staying at? Where are you going to eat tonight? What's your room number? Okay.

647
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:42,280
That is, don't be like that. Don't be like that.

648
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:57,280
So don't be like that because you're unlikely to get like, oh, do you use discord? I'd love to keep in contact.

649
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:19,280
Okay. Our coal high gets hit on a lot. It's the way I dressed.

650
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:28,280
How do you dress like this? Like this, duh.

651
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:48,280
Or I, or honestly, I just like, any upcoming cons? No, I'm not a con person anymore. I've become, what do you call it?

652
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:56,280
I've become, do you have a VLR sensor? IRL? Yeah, yeah, I do.

653
02:11:56,280 --> 02:12:07,280
Um, yeah, I just walk around with this, with this giant pair of scissors in my hair and the VLR logo. That's how I look.

654
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:13,280
I become a Shedden. Yeah, a recluse, a Shedden. So I don't go to cons. I don't feel comfortable with going to cons.

655
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:32,280
And I am now having the new worry if, even if I'm like, even if I do go to a con, there is no percentage higher chance, a percentage of a higher chance.

656
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:42,280
And I'll be recognized just by my voice alone.

657
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:51,280
No, I'm serious. That's something that I'm actually scared of.

658
02:12:51,280 --> 02:13:11,280
Because my entire life has been, has been, has been, oh my gosh, I found you at this convention or I found you at this place because I heard you laugh.

659
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:31,280
Or, oh my gosh, I found you because I heard you, you, your voice.

660
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:43,280
So, um, and the thing is I'm a giggler. I'm a laffer. I'll, I just laugh.

661
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:54,280
And, uh, I laugh a lot. So it's too noticeable.

662
02:13:54,280 --> 02:14:09,280
Yeah, I, I, I am, was, I'm not good with people in real life anymore. Honestly, I'm not good with real people anymore.

663
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:17,280
I may be an extrovert. So I'm just like, huh. So I, I had a nightmare, like a couple of nights ago, I was like, I was at a con.

664
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:26,280
And then I, I was like, oh, that's so cute. Like a, like a, at a booth. And then someone turned around and was like, Mercy, Moe, Deast.

665
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:35,280
And I go, and I woke up.

666
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:45,280
See, the thing is that it wouldn't be much of a problem, but I am a traditionalist and I don't want people knowing me.

667
02:14:45,280 --> 02:15:00,280
You know, I don't want people knowing me. I don't like, I don't like it when people figure it out.

668
02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:08,280
And I definitely, definitely, definitely don't get me wrong.

669
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:24,280
I trust Senpai's, a lot of my Senpai's, but there are a lot of people with malicious intent. So for example, um, if someone find out, find out who I am, maybe they'll take a picture of me from a distance and then post it all over online.

670
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:32,280
And then I get mean comments and then I'm crying and then, you know,

671
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:54,280
or if, you know, it could be even worse. Like for example, they might follow me home and I still have my parents to think about, you know.

672
02:15:54,280 --> 02:16:00,280
And like, you know, yeah.

673
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:25,280
If, if there is a chance, if there is an off chance, if there is an off chance that perhaps we do meet IRL by accident or a coincidence, I ask my Senpai's to keep it to themselves.

674
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:40,280
Keep it to themselves as our little, little secret.

675
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:48,280
Okay, what about a very handsome man? If I met a very handsome man, um, I still don't trust it.

676
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:55,280
I've had the re, okay, I'll be real with my Senpai's for a second.

677
02:16:55,280 --> 02:17:13,280
The reason why I have trust issues and the reason why I have mental Illinois is because I used to have a friend who I thought was my friend, but they were really, they tried to ruin my life.

678
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:33,280
And I didn't know, but the entire time they were like talking behind my back and stuff. So I cannot trust anyone now.

679
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:54,280
So I cannot trust anyone. Which is why, um, which is why I have trouble trusting if, even if you do have the, the sweetest intent.

680
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:59,280
Did you write a tweet longer? No, I had the tweet longer written about me.

681
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:14,280
And I did not do anything. It wasn't a tweet longer. It was like a Facebook thing, which is why I quit Facebook too.

682
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:24,280
Um, no, I think they were just using me as like a scapegoat.

683
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:31,280
I think they were using me as a scapegoat.

684
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:42,280
Because, um, they, they spread a lot of lies about me. And then I got like constantly harassed.

685
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:57,280
So which is why, um, I tend to, tend to keep things to myself. Okay, sometimes.

686
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:07,280
So yeah, I tried to keep things to myself. So, uh, when, when the whole thing happened, I was, I was like in the middle of exams.

687
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:16,280
So I didn't know it was happening until like when I went outside to a convention, someone spit on me and like called me names.

688
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:36,280
And I didn't know what was happening until that happened. And then I was like, hated. And then it took years, but people found out that that person was spreading lies.

689
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:52,280
So yeah, I have trust issues. So even if like someone who's super, super, super nice comes up to me, I cannot.

690
02:19:52,280 --> 02:20:00,280
I cannot trust them.

691
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:11,280
It took years for me to like open up again.

692
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:29,280
It took me years to open up again, which is why I have a bit of trust issues. And which is why I do have very close friends, but never, you know, I do have very close friends, but I don't make more friends than that.

693
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:39,280
I have my Ryder die friends and not more, much more than that.

694
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:49,280
That's it. And my Ryder die friends are my gen mates, some, some IRL friends.

695
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:55,280
And, and of course,

696
02:20:55,280 --> 02:21:01,280
Serenity.

697
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:07,280
And of course, some other friends, online friends.

698
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:11,280
Yeah.

699
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:18,280
So yeah, that's why I'm just like, keep it a secret, but also I won't trust you.

700
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:25,280
And that's why I don't trust you and you always stay in that cage.

701
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:31,280
Next question.

702
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:42,280
Should I get this limited edition skin for a gacha character or feed myself for three days, feed yourself for three days, because if you're looking at a different character and with lustful eyes, and it's not me, I'm going to be very jealous.

703
02:21:42,280 --> 02:21:51,280
Okay, next question.

704
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:55,280
No, no, why are you saying get the skin? No, no, no.

705
02:21:55,280 --> 02:22:06,280
You're going to look at the skin with lustful, lustful gaze and I'm right there.

706
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:23,280
No, no, no, no, the game you're playing is free to play. Use your, use your free currency. Don't use real cash.

707
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:34,280
Don't use real cash.

708
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:43,280
No, no, it's free to play. It's free to play.

709
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:46,280
It's free to play.

710
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:50,280
Do your dailies.

711
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:55,280
But it's a limited skin. Well, maybe you should have just saved up for the limited skin.

712
02:22:55,280 --> 02:23:05,280
Huh?

713
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,280
Oh my gosh.

714
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:13,280
Get the food.

715
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:19,280
The limited skins are only pay to win. You can admire it in a distance. That's fine.

716
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:27,280
I'd rather, I'd rather eat my own foot than pay for, pay for a gacha game.

717
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:33,280
And I've already gotten, gotten everyone I wanted in like, Nikkei.

718
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:48,280
Get your food stocks, I guess. Yeah, you can get the skin.

719
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:52,280
Ah.

720
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:56,280
Thank you Anonymous for 20. The limited skin.

721
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:59,280
It's Yukohai.

722
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:07,280
Is she? It's me? It's me?

723
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:11,280
Oh, thank you.

724
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:34,280
Thank you Anonymous.

725
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:40,280
The rest, the other senpais are telling you to buy the skin, so I guess you have to buy the skin.

726
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:51,280
Unfortunately, I think that paying for a free to play game is absurd.

727
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:57,280
My question for you is how can I stop loving you so much, Kohai? Keep loving me.

728
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:04,280
You can't stop.

729
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:06,280
Next question.

730
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:11,280
A friend of mine got me with a trick. What is the sound of one hand plapping?

731
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:15,280
I still don't get it. Anyways, should I keep his car or get back to him?

732
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:18,280
Show him your moves. Show him your moves.

733
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:22,280
Clap with one hand.

734
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:32,280
I can't, I can't clap with one hand though, but if you, with enough practice, you can make a whole applause.

735
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:40,280
Do you get crowns limited skin? No, and I didn't care for crowns limited skin.

736
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:44,280
Read again. Clapping.

737
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:53,280
What's the difference between that? I thought that was just a spelling error.

738
02:25:53,280 --> 02:26:02,280
I thought that was a spelling error. I thought they made one hand clapping.

739
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:08,280
You don't think so?

740
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:14,280
I have no idea what this means then.

741
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:18,280
I have no idea what this means then.

742
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:22,280
I thought it was a type ball.

743
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:28,280
I have no idea what this means then. What does this mean? Is this like a pull your finger thing?

744
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:37,280
Yeah, pull my finger.

745
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,280
I got it back in him.

746
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:43,280
Part on their pillow.

747
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:50,280
Leaf.

748
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:57,280
Anyways, I don't know what this means, but if it's enough to key the car,

749
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:04,280
well, I don't think that's enough. Keying your car is not enough.

750
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:09,280
It's not enough.

751
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:20,280
Okay, man, giving them the sugar-free, high-rebowl gummy bears as a gift.

752
02:27:20,280 --> 02:27:29,280
You're welcome.

753
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:33,280
Mercy, I love being caged with you.

754
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:42,280
What does it say about my psyche? You're perfectly normal. Of course you want to stay.

755
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:45,280
Next question.

756
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:51,280
Hi, Mercy. I really enjoyed your streams, and I hope you get some good rest after your busy debut week.

757
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:57,280
I did have a question for your Q&A stream. I'm going to be writing an MCAT exam in a few months.

758
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:04,280
I know my call high was quite the student, so I was wondering if you had any tips for stepping to share a surprise.

759
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:08,280
Thanks, love you, Mercy.

760
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:12,280
Hmm, oops.

761
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:15,280
Next, over some stuff.

762
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:20,280
I just read my textbook out loud.

763
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:26,280
I read it out loud and I wrote some facts that I was like, oh, interesting, nice.

764
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:30,280
That's all I really did.

765
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:41,280
Sometimes if I really memorized something, I would read it out loud and write it on down as well, like rewrite the whole thing.

766
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:48,280
Just so it can be in my mind.

767
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:54,280
Take some breaks.

768
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:57,280
Why did you major in Mercy?

769
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:03,280
Well, a lot of things.

770
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:09,280
I rewrote and read out loud, so for example, if I grab what I have, I don't have a textbook.

771
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:13,280
Oh wait, I do have a textbook.

772
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:16,280
Sort of.

773
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:22,280
For here, I can have like, oh, shit.

774
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:27,280
Sort of.

775
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:38,280
Here, vocabulary where it's often used in the Japanese language proficiency test are divided into various themes organized into chapters and sections for ease of study.

776
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:46,280
You may progress equitably through each chapter or begin wherever at whatever chapter interests you.

777
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:51,280
Things like that. If you read it out loud, it works.

778
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:56,280
It works, generally.

779
02:29:56,280 --> 02:30:14,280
What really helps me when I was studying was definitely reading it out loud, but also taking an actual interest in the subject.

780
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:24,280
So if I was reading something and I didn't like the subject or I thought the subject was boring, I didn't.

781
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:31,280
I didn't. I would force myself to be super interested in the subject.

782
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:40,280
I'd be forcing myself super interested hyperfixate on it.

783
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:43,280
Which is why. Oh my gosh.

784
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:48,280
Ring! Ring cloud! Hi!

785
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:59,280
I forced an interest. I don't know. Are you studying in a field that you want?

786
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:06,280
Most of the subjects I studied and I picked specific classes that...

787
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:09,280
What was the class you really enjoyed?

788
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:13,280
Oh!

789
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:20,280
The class I really enjoyed was...

790
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:24,280
What was it called?

791
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:31,280
Early communications... Early communication history.

792
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:39,280
A subject that one that I had no interest in? Calculus.

793
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:43,280
Calculus. I didn't give a shit about calculus.

794
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:48,280
I nearly failed calculus.

795
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:58,280
I hate math. I hate math.

796
02:31:58,280 --> 02:32:08,280
It doesn't help that the professor, when I went up to the professor, when I was like, okay, I'm confused about this.

797
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:14,280
What do I do? How can you explain this to me? The professor was like, ask your peers.

798
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:22,280
And I went to ask my peers and they went, I don't know.

799
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:26,280
Great. Great. Great.

800
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:30,280
Fuck you.

801
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:39,280
That's probably another thing why I didn't like math at all.

802
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:51,280
And I'll tell you, when I was in elementary school, or grade school, I had, I loved math.

803
02:32:51,280 --> 02:33:00,280
I loved math.

804
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:10,280
When I got to like middle school, high school, whatever you call those grades,

805
02:33:10,280 --> 02:33:15,280
I was getting punished for getting the right answer right.

806
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:25,280
So for example, I would write, for example, I didn't put something in brackets, I got a zero in it.

807
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:30,280
Why would I put something in brackets if it doesn't require being in brackets?

808
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,280
For example, two times two. Why would I put that in brackets?

809
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:36,280
No, but because I didn't put it in brackets, I got a zero on it.

810
02:33:36,280 --> 02:33:50,280
Another time, it equals, you know, like, or if you equal, and then there was a time where they made me write out my answers,

811
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:56,280
not like write out my answers like, oh, equals, so and so, like with the equals sign and the number,

812
02:33:56,280 --> 02:34:04,280
they would write, they would make me write my process, they would make me write my process.

813
02:34:04,280 --> 02:34:13,280
So I literally wrote, I added so and so and did it to this number.

814
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:21,280
And therefore, this question is this.

815
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:25,280
And this happened for many, many, many years.

816
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:30,280
And so I freaking hated math.

817
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:34,280
No, but like, it's not like show your work, like, oh, here's my like order of things.

818
02:34:34,280 --> 02:34:45,280
It was, you had to physically write out what you did.

819
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:58,280
Like, literally, write out what you did, like, I added, I a space a d d d e d.

820
02:34:58,280 --> 02:35:06,280
These numbers to do that.

821
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:11,280
And I said, and then you had to write down, like, the whole thing.

822
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:16,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, I added three, two, four and equals seven for like that.

823
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:19,280
And that went on for years.

824
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:22,280
And which is why I hate math.

825
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,280
Which is why I hate math.

826
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:39,280
And then I was, I, my mama, mama, Mercy used to be a math teacher.

827
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:41,280
She used to be a math teacher.

828
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:48,280
Okay.

829
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:49,280
She used to be a math teacher.

830
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:56,280
So when I gave her my math homework to look over, she said it was fucking ridiculous.

831
02:35:56,280 --> 02:36:09,280
She helped me, but she thought it was stupid because she looked over my test and she was like, why were you docked marks for not putting like, for example, if it's nine, if the answer is nine, right.

832
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:15,280
And the question does not call for to the first decimal decimal.

833
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:22,280
I was still being punished for like writing nine instead of 9.0.

834
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:35,280
Or if it was rounded to the next number and I would round it to the next number, I still got punished because for some reason I wasn't supposed to round it.

835
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:48,280
So my mom, my mom, mama, mama, Mercy understood why I hated math because she thought it was ridiculous.

836
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:54,280
She in fact went to the teacher and the teacher was like, well, that's how we do it here.

837
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:57,280
And mama was like, pissed.

838
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:59,280
She was pissed.

839
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:04,280
Mama was pissed.

840
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:11,280
So it didn't help.

841
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:16,280
And honestly, a lot of teachers did that to me.

842
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:27,280
So mama was pissed and like usually mama literally mama mama went, I used to be a math teacher.

843
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:37,280
And these questions are answered correctly because of this, this, this, and they're like, that's not how we do it in our curriculum.

844
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:42,280
So mama was like, if this is going to be like this, do not take math.

845
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:43,280
Avoid math.

846
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:48,280
Like mama was literally like, do not take math if this is how they're going to, going to do it.

847
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:10,280
But yeah, like, no, I ended up, I ended up, I think calculus, I ended up dropping, I ended up dropping because I was kind of ridiculous of how bad it was.

848
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:18,280
Yeah.

849
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:24,280
Anyways, that's how you become, you pass the MCAT and become a doctor.

850
02:38:24,280 --> 02:38:27,280
I don't know what it goes with.

851
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:40,280
But if you read things out loud, if you do practice questions, if you do, if you do, was that uni math class?

852
02:38:40,280 --> 02:38:48,280
Uni math class was the professor that was like, well ask your peers and I asked my peers and they're like, I don't fucking know.

853
02:38:48,280 --> 02:39:04,280
It was like kind of like when I was still like grades one through whatever numbers in your country was when I hated math and that's where mama helped me the most.

854
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:17,280
All of my, all of my, all of my, all of my classes that kind of involved math were not great because probably because of my hate for them.

855
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:23,280
I ended up not doing very well in anything that did math.

856
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:25,280
So good luck Senpai.

857
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:26,280
Good luck on your MCAT.

858
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:27,280
Become a doctor.

859
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:28,280
Make lots of money.

860
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:32,280
Save people's lives.

861
02:39:32,280 --> 02:39:34,280
A communication history was awesome.

862
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:38,280
Yeah.

863
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:40,280
Yeah.

864
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:43,280
Anything was theory with theory I excelled at.

865
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:49,280
So even if it's complex theory, I really loved.

866
02:39:49,280 --> 02:40:06,280
I like complex theory and is not game theory, shut up.

867
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:18,280
For example, I like looking at theories and how history and how history works and basically formulating meanings into things.

868
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:24,280
Those things were really, really fun to me.

869
02:40:25,280 --> 02:40:27,280
Like really, really fun to me.

870
02:40:27,280 --> 02:40:44,280
So like if I had kind of like anything to do with like how if we talked about basically like how people perceive things and how things are and like theories relating to that.

871
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:47,280
That was great fun for me.

872
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:50,280
That was great fun for me.

873
02:40:55,280 --> 02:41:03,280
So that was really a lot of fun and I can use that in everyday life too when I'm thinking about things.

874
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:05,280
Yeah, did I take philosophy?

875
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:18,280
No, but I took a lot of a lot of things, theory things and I a lot of times I would get it before my peers, my like classmates.

876
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:27,280
And so I would explain to my classmates and then with examples and stuff and they were like, oh, I get it now. Thanks.

877
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:32,280
But I managed to pick things up like theory right away.

878
02:41:39,280 --> 02:41:46,280
Honestly, another course that I had lots of great fun in was law.

879
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:51,280
Law was really fun too.

880
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:54,280
I got an A plus in that course. It was really fun.

881
02:41:54,280 --> 02:42:04,280
And the professor gave me like out of nowhere, he just gave me a grant.

882
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:11,280
He gave me a grant and I was like, oh, thank you.

883
02:42:12,280 --> 02:42:25,280
It paid a good chunk of my tuition.

884
02:42:32,280 --> 02:42:35,280
Yeah, it was really fun. It was really fun.

885
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:43,280
Professor asked me if I wanted to be a lawyer and I was like, I have to take math to become a lawyer.

886
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:50,280
Was that the one that told you to take acid? No.

887
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:59,280
Actually, the one that told me to take acid was the early communications history professor. That was really fun.

888
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:13,280
I would tell you, honestly, I would tell you more about my academic background.

889
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:34,280
But I think my, I think a lot of people would, would, um, would, I think a lot of people would, uh,

890
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:42,280
start to question exactly why, why I'm doing this line of work instead.

891
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:51,280
I think many people would question why I'm doing this line of work instead.

892
02:43:54,280 --> 02:44:03,280
Oh, it's not like doxing myself. It's more like, I'd rather, I'd rather not tell

893
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:16,280
since a lot of people might judge by it. Just, just know, just know that maybe I'm a little overqualified.

894
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:33,280
That's it. But I don't really want to say because then people might start making theories and stuff.

895
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:46,280
Okay, what is the easiest way to get a girl to fall in love with you?

896
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:50,280
Unironically, be nice.

897
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:59,280
Unironically, be nice.

898
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:20,280
Now, be nice. Like, if you are a considerate person, um, if you are considerate, if you think of others,

899
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:34,280
uh, if you, like, for example, um, offer, offer your like umbrella or you like a coat if like a girl is like warm, she will notice that and she will remember that.

900
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:43,280
Shut the fuck up. No, don't be one of those nice, no, I'm literally mean, don't, like, you, you have to be genuine in your niceness though.

901
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:49,280
You have to be genuine in your niceness.

902
02:45:52,280 --> 02:46:05,280
The bars and health, yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty low. Wouldn't they abuse that? Like, who is they? Who is they? Are you cheating on me? Are they?

903
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:15,280
Just be nice. Just be nice.

904
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:26,280
Like, if you say you're a nice guy and everyone around you said you're a big frickin' jerk, maybe you're not a nice guy.

905
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:37,280
Be a good person.

906
02:46:39,280 --> 02:46:52,280
Literally, okay, fine, fine, fine. We'll change out semantics. We'll change semantics around, okay? Be a good person and you'll be noticed.

907
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:57,280
Be a good person.

908
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:04,280
Hold, hold doors open for someone. Check on someone if they're, they're okay.

909
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:16,280
Help, help your mom with your growth, with her groceries.

910
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:30,280
But what if I'm a bad boy? Some girls will like that, but I feel like most girls, or at least the girls that I know, genuinely prefer a good person.

911
02:47:34,280 --> 02:47:45,280
Like, for example, if you, if you, like, don't be, don't be weird.

912
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:55,280
Don't be weird. Don't be like, oh, I bought this girl flowers and she wouldn't, she wouldn't give me a kiss goodnight.

913
02:47:56,280 --> 02:47:57,280
Okay.

914
02:48:07,280 --> 02:48:15,280
Instead, just be like, oh, I gave her flowers and she seemed to really like it and that's all I need, you know?

915
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:32,280
Not even a peck. I mean, like, it depends on the relationship. If you don't know her very well, or you don't have that type of relationship with her, then yeah.

916
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:45,280
Anyways, that doesn't apply to me though. Clearly, if I just kidnap my senpais, you'll fall in love with me, right? Easy.

917
02:48:54,280 --> 02:49:01,280
What if she loves another guy? Move on. Move on. It's over. That moment, over. Move on.

918
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:20,280
Move on. It's over. I'm sorry. That's it. Next question.

919
02:49:21,280 --> 02:49:37,280
Okay, help. I found this new Vtuber company that's full of cute. I don't know if that is girls. How can I save myself from their deadly grasp before it is too late? It's too late already. You have already fallen and you've been already groomed.

920
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:39,280
Okay, next question.

921
02:49:40,280 --> 02:49:52,280
I need advice on how to get more beautiful Mercy laughter in my life. Make a clip compilation and play it over and over again.

922
02:49:52,280 --> 02:50:16,280
How can I overcome my fear of job interviews? I have to earn money for us, you and me. I can't do it now if I'm too anxious to even go to a job interview.

923
02:50:17,280 --> 02:50:20,280
Practice. Practice with your friends.

924
02:50:25,280 --> 02:50:37,280
Practice with your friends. Practice in a mirror. Practice. Practice, practice, practice. Get your mom to sit down, ask you some interview questions, and then memorize them.

925
02:50:37,280 --> 02:50:54,280
Force yourself. I don't like driving, but I drive a lot. So, as you just got to do it.

926
02:50:54,280 --> 02:51:06,280
Sorry. Sorry, you just have to do it. Practice. If you go to a bunch of job interviews, it gets easier, trust me.

927
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:16,280
Next question. I've never been in a relationship before. How do you suggest I get a girlfriend? I'm already your girlfriend.

928
02:51:17,280 --> 02:51:20,280
But remember Nyan Taddle.

929
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:26,280
I don't know how to approach women. Can you help?

930
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:38,280
Just talk to them? I think I've answered this one already. So, we'll move on.

931
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:49,280
Oh my gosh. Why do you guys always make these long morals? At least for Q&A.

932
02:52:09,280 --> 02:52:12,280
Mercy, will you go out with me? I'm going out with every single senpai already.

933
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:24,280
We're all in a relationship. A loving relationship. I'm in a loving relationship with my senpais.

934
02:52:24,280 --> 02:52:40,280
Mercy, I need some serious advice. How can I prove my love to you? If I prove it, will I be allowed out of the cage? I promise I won't ever leave. Please believe me.

935
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:44,280
Sounds like I can't believe you. Stay in the cage.

936
02:52:45,280 --> 02:53:02,280
Hi, Mercy. I'm looking forward to giving up my agency and spending the rest of my days only looking at you.

937
02:53:03,280 --> 02:53:10,280
Normally, I'd be a good senpai and just figure it out, but I heard you were offering life advice.

938
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:22,280
There are some fun ways to break it to my work that I will no longer be coming to the office and may not have internet access or a computer.

939
02:53:22,280 --> 02:53:27,280
I don't know. I guess you have to leave your two weeks notice.

940
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:33,280
It's like, ah, personal agency.

941
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:51,280
I guess you leave your two weeks notice. I don't know how to say that. Just leave your two weeks notice and go peace.

942
02:53:52,280 --> 02:54:07,280
Oh, but yeah, the cage has internet though. I let you, you have supervised, um, supervised internet.

943
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:21,280
For Q&A, I'm too lazy to do laundry, but also hate being perceived. Any tips on how to not do laundry while also being clothed enough to go outside without drawing gaps, gigs?

944
02:54:23,280 --> 02:54:33,280
Goof? I don't know what that last word means. Um, wear clothes.

945
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:37,280
Wear clothes. You can re-wear your clothes.

946
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:54,280
Anyways, re-wear your clothes. Spray on some febrize or like some perfume. You're good to go by.

947
02:54:54,280 --> 02:55:03,280
Ah, re-wear your clothes. Done.

948
02:55:03,280 --> 02:55:29,280
We're live at Vice stream and feel free to respond serious or silly or not at all. I wouldn't, I won't mind just sharing some thoughts.

949
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:37,280
How do you think people bond? Or how do you build a stronger community where people want to be there doing things together?

950
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:48,280
Maybe you have some observation from VTubing. I don't ever plan to get together because every time I've tried, people haven't been interested.

951
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:56,280
And it's used to be less of a problem because I was involved in established friend groups and communities where I was invited.

952
02:55:56,280 --> 02:56:07,280
But after college, especially COVID, I stopped receiving invitations. I feel like I don't know how to bootstrap group plans on my own.

953
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:16,280
I have parallel struggles at work getting more into leadership and struggling to motivate co-workers to engage.

954
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:29,280
I'm not sure if I'm the problem or if I'm surrounded by the wrong people. I think I'm probably well-liked as a side character but never people's inner circles.

955
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:34,280
I don't know what others do that I'm not doing. Thanks.

956
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:37,280
Okay.

957
02:56:43,280 --> 02:56:50,280
This one might come off as a controversial answer. But you have to know your crowd.

958
02:56:50,280 --> 02:57:05,280
You kind of have to know your crowd. So I have different friend groups and they all like different things. You cannot force the same things amongst them.

959
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:11,280
First of all, you're not a secondary character. You are someone important.

960
02:57:12,280 --> 02:57:22,280
But don't forget you are also maybe perhaps yourself have been sealing yourself off due to COVID or what else did you say?

961
02:57:28,280 --> 02:57:33,280
Or you're falling out with friends. Perhaps you've already put a shield amongst yourself.

962
02:57:34,280 --> 02:57:47,280
But remember that you're each group of people if in order to engage and stuff they have their own interests and needs as well.

963
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:56,280
So for example, your co-workers maybe what is motivating them is different from what your friends are.

964
02:57:56,280 --> 02:58:03,280
So for example, if you are in a leadership role and you're like everybody let's do an icebreaker perhaps it feels forced.

965
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:09,280
Perhaps it feels forced and people feel like they're obligated to do it.

966
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:17,280
Instead of something that you want to cultivate friendships with.

967
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:40,280
But if you're in a leadership position, you have to know that everyone will view you as the leader, the boss and someone who either you listen to and they will not want to engage in like a friendship type of thing.

968
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:49,280
I don't think workplaces are a great place to make friends simply because there's that power dynamic that people feel around you.

969
02:58:51,280 --> 02:58:59,280
As well as well with your friend groups and other friend groups, you really have to get to know what they're into.

970
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:08,280
So if you're going to suggest something like, oh, hey, let's do a movie together, you have to be have to gauge what kind of movie they're into.

971
02:59:08,280 --> 02:59:16,280
For example, I have a group of friends who loves watching anime, but the other group of friends does not like watching anime.

972
02:59:17,280 --> 02:59:25,280
And therefore they would prefer to watch something such as old retro classic movies.

973
02:59:25,280 --> 02:59:38,280
Like the birds. Let's just pick the birds as an example.

974
02:59:42,280 --> 02:59:48,280
Or like even Shrek, exactly, like maybe your friend group, that friend group prefer friends or something.

975
02:59:48,280 --> 02:59:55,280
At the same time, understand that there's a dynamic within friend groups that might be a little different than what you're into.

976
02:59:56,280 --> 03:00:10,280
Instead of trying to be the people pleaser and the event organizer for your friends, I highly recommend making events with only perhaps one friend or two friends amongst your peers.

977
03:00:11,280 --> 03:00:14,280
Don't try to force people together who don't want to be together.

978
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:29,280
So maybe they're cool with just hanging out and talking in like a group group chat, but they're not okay with hanging out in a call.

979
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:45,280
So in that case, I would say lower your friendship group to about one or two people that you can truly hang out with at any time.

980
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:51,280
How you pick those people is entirely based off how you connect with them.

981
03:00:52,280 --> 03:01:08,280
Remember, if you are in a place of leadership at your workplace, your co-workers may not be the best people to force into or motivate into engaging with things because to them it is an additional chore.

982
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:29,280
Meanwhile, in another group, if you have a bigger group of friends or if you're new to their environment and you're kind of still in the initiation, we're still getting to know you do not force it.

983
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:44,280
Do not force it. You will simply make yourself feel like you are too gogetty or you're too strong-handed in your suggestions for events.

984
03:01:47,280 --> 03:01:53,280
So instead, don't try to force things. Make them as suggestions instead.

985
03:01:54,280 --> 03:02:02,280
That's how you deal with people. Don't forget, you are not the side character. People do care about you.

986
03:02:03,280 --> 03:02:11,280
People do care about you. You are someone that someone cares about. But remember, you have to take care of yourself first.

987
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:28,280
You have to take care of yourself first. Then organize events for people because if you are making events for people to like you, that is not the way to go.

988
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:32,280
That is not the way to go.

989
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:44,280
If you are making events because you are close friends with these friends, okay. Ask first. Ask. Hey, do you guys want to do this?

990
03:02:45,280 --> 03:02:54,280
And see if you can, see if you're, you can gage if they're saying yes out of politeness or yes out of like genuine interest.

991
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:59,280
Okay. Bam.

992
03:03:00,280 --> 03:03:03,280
I hope that was okay advice.

993
03:03:11,280 --> 03:03:12,280
Next question.

994
03:03:13,280 --> 03:03:23,280
Hi, Mercy. The city I live in just announced that there will be no water tomorrow for maintenance.

995
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:30,280
I'm already filling water in buckets, cups and whatnot. My question is what's the best container to put water in? Sorry for the really dumb question.

996
03:03:31,280 --> 03:03:32,280
A carafe.

997
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:42,280
I would say carafe.

998
03:03:42,280 --> 03:03:43,280
A carafe.

999
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:54,280
You can just use a carafe for drinking water.

1000
03:03:55,280 --> 03:04:00,280
If you're looking for water for like watering the garden or something, I suggest a rain barrel.

1001
03:04:00,280 --> 03:04:13,280
A what? A carafe. Do you not know what a carafe is?

1002
03:04:18,280 --> 03:04:20,280
Okay, it's about like carafe.

1003
03:04:20,280 --> 03:04:21,280
Okay.

1004
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:25,280
A carafe.

1005
03:04:25,280 --> 03:04:29,280
C-A-R-A-F-E.

1006
03:04:29,280 --> 03:04:33,280
It is a container used to serve liquid.

1007
03:04:39,280 --> 03:04:41,280
C-A-R-A.

1008
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:45,280
F-E-C-A-R-A.

1009
03:04:45,280 --> 03:04:48,280
F-E-C-A-R-A.

1010
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:49,280
F-E-C-A-R-A-F-E.

1011
03:04:49,280 --> 03:04:54,280
It is not carafe. It is a carafe.

1012
03:04:59,280 --> 03:05:03,280
Like giraffe, but a carafe.

1013
03:05:09,280 --> 03:05:12,280
Drinking water is great in a carafe.

1014
03:05:13,280 --> 03:05:15,280
Especially if it has a lid on it.

1015
03:05:19,280 --> 03:05:22,280
Anyways, yeah.

1016
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:26,280
I would use it in carafe.

1017
03:05:28,280 --> 03:05:30,280
Store things in the carafe and stuff.

1018
03:05:31,280 --> 03:05:32,280
That's it.

1019
03:05:38,280 --> 03:05:44,280
I have a few of them because it keeps water cooler and you can also put juice and stuff.

1020
03:05:44,280 --> 03:05:52,280
But my, I also have, there's one called a, there's a carafe that you can put on your bedside table.

1021
03:05:52,280 --> 03:06:01,280
So it's, it's like the cup is functions at the lid and you can just use it to like drink water as in bed, essentially.

1022
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:03,280
Done.

1023
03:06:07,280 --> 03:06:11,280
So yeah, you can get them pretty much anywhere.

1024
03:06:12,280 --> 03:06:16,280
That's up for hand washing and non-water stuff. Yeah.

1025
03:06:17,280 --> 03:06:23,280
But for drinking water, I suggest using a few boil things, if you boil it.

1026
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:31,280
A carafe can be like hot water safe, but be careful because it is glass.

1027
03:06:31,280 --> 03:06:39,280
So let the boiled water cool down to maybe room temperature or even, or even colder, colder than that.

1028
03:06:40,280 --> 03:06:43,280
Cooler than that. And then you can just pour it into the carafe.

1029
03:06:44,280 --> 03:06:49,280
How big are carafs? It really depends on what carafe you have.

1030
03:06:50,280 --> 03:06:59,280
For example, I have a carafe that is like two liters.

1031
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:08,280
So they aren't really uniform at all, but they're really good.

1032
03:07:08,280 --> 03:07:10,280
I have a few of them.

1033
03:07:13,280 --> 03:07:19,280
I have a few of them at my house and Papa always fills them up when he's bored.

1034
03:07:19,280 --> 03:07:21,280
So there's lots of drinking water.

1035
03:07:25,280 --> 03:07:26,280
You're welcome.

1036
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:27,280
You're welcome.

1037
03:07:32,280 --> 03:07:35,280
I don't know how much, excuse me.

1038
03:07:35,280 --> 03:07:39,280
I don't know how much that is in Freedom Units. I'm sorry.

1039
03:07:49,280 --> 03:07:53,280
That's why I'm just like, oh, okay, well, that's, uh...

1040
03:07:56,280 --> 03:08:04,280
No, seriously, I have no idea how much this is in Freedom Units, but I have like a few of them.

1041
03:08:09,280 --> 03:08:11,280
Next question.

1042
03:08:15,280 --> 03:08:20,280
Oh no, my stomach is growling. I hope you guys can't hear that.

1043
03:08:21,280 --> 03:08:26,280
So I recently hung out with this girl and she brought a friend along.

1044
03:08:28,280 --> 03:08:32,280
The girls got a little silly and jokingly called me their dog.

1045
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:36,280
They even put a collar around my neck and asked me to bark for them.

1046
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:39,280
They were super excited and I found myself too polite to decline.

1047
03:08:39,280 --> 03:08:44,280
And they rewarded me with head baths and doggy kisses, which felt kind of weird.

1048
03:08:44,280 --> 03:08:48,280
Any advice for handling similar situations in the future?

1049
03:08:51,280 --> 03:08:56,280
What advice do you need? You are now a dog. Mark?

1050
03:08:59,280 --> 03:09:02,280
Like, do you hate it or what?

1051
03:09:02,280 --> 03:09:07,280
I feel like this is, this is like a lot of people's dreams, right?

1052
03:09:09,280 --> 03:09:12,280
Anyways, arf, arf, arf, start barking!

1053
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:22,280
Okay.

1054
03:09:28,280 --> 03:09:29,280
Okay.

1055
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:35,280
Hi, where are you going?

1056
03:09:39,280 --> 03:09:46,280
I don't know how you're getting out to meet other girls, so clearly this person isn't a senpai, so I don't give a shit.

1057
03:09:47,280 --> 03:09:48,280
Okay?

1058
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:51,280
Okay.

1059
03:10:02,280 --> 03:10:07,280
Dear Mercy, I came here to tell you about my problem, helping to make it more problematic.

1060
03:10:08,280 --> 03:10:11,280
My issue is that I can't read the atmosphere around me.

1061
03:10:11,280 --> 03:10:16,280
I am socially inept and quite naive all the time, especially when it comes to people.

1062
03:10:17,280 --> 03:10:21,280
Especially when it comes to problematic situations, or just talking to people.

1063
03:10:23,280 --> 03:10:25,280
I'm gonna tell you, it's always gonna be worse.

1064
03:10:27,280 --> 03:10:30,280
Live and learn! Live and learn!

1065
03:10:31,280 --> 03:10:36,280
Honestly, I have trouble telling apart situations and stuff too, so.

1066
03:10:38,280 --> 03:10:40,280
I've only learned with experience.

1067
03:10:41,280 --> 03:10:43,280
I think that's called masking.

1068
03:10:47,280 --> 03:10:48,280
Mask up!

1069
03:10:55,280 --> 03:10:56,280
So mask up!

1070
03:10:58,280 --> 03:10:59,280
Mask up!

1071
03:10:59,280 --> 03:11:01,280
And start pretending!

1072
03:11:04,280 --> 03:11:05,280
You're welcome!

1073
03:11:06,280 --> 03:11:22,280
Life advice, hypothetically, if someone were trying to get a decent chunk, going through a decent chunk of anime, let's just say two seasons and two movies, would you have any tips on how to sleep less and anime more?

1074
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:28,280
I don't know about you, but I have...

1075
03:11:28,280 --> 03:11:41,280
I have hyper fixation, like super hyper fixation, so I won't stop until I finish.

1076
03:11:42,280 --> 03:11:43,280
So I don't know about you, Senpai.

1077
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:51,280
I suppose it's okay if you do it at like 1.5 speed, yeah.

1078
03:11:54,280 --> 03:11:56,280
Like, what anime?

1079
03:11:56,280 --> 03:11:58,280
Ah, clearly, it's Cardcaptor Sakura!

1080
03:12:03,280 --> 03:12:07,280
But hyper fixation, I have a hyper fixation, so I just watch it.

1081
03:12:09,280 --> 03:12:13,280
I just watch the whole thing, because I'm really into it.

1082
03:12:15,280 --> 03:12:16,280
Oh yeah, you're welcome!

1083
03:12:17,280 --> 03:12:20,280
1.5 isn't bad, as long as you get the plot and everything.

1084
03:12:21,280 --> 03:12:26,280
Two times speed if you're watching pause.

1085
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:38,280
So yeah, if I hyper fixate on something, for example, I have to literally stop myself from playing games all the way, so...

1086
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:44,280
Yeah, I recommend...

1087
03:12:45,280 --> 03:12:52,280
Maybe doing 1.5 speed if you want to do that, if you want to...

1088
03:12:55,280 --> 03:13:03,280
If you want to watch it in all its entirety, in the original format, it's in.

1089
03:13:06,280 --> 03:13:10,280
I like it, just like it, and you won't sleep.

1090
03:13:11,280 --> 03:13:17,280
I haven't heard Tenchi Murio in a long time, I used to read that, read the mango.

1091
03:13:19,280 --> 03:13:28,280
But yeah, that is all the question I have, and I went through Senpai 44 questions.

1092
03:13:29,280 --> 03:13:36,280
I went through 44 questions, and I kept on getting some in the middle of stream, so I can...

1093
03:13:41,280 --> 03:13:46,280
I can see all of this.

1094
03:13:47,280 --> 03:13:50,280
Oh, I got so many questions during streams.

1095
03:13:52,280 --> 03:13:59,280
I'll see if I can pick one from what I've gotten in case someone wants something.

1096
03:14:02,280 --> 03:14:03,280
Okay...

1097
03:14:11,280 --> 03:14:14,280
What is my ideal order at McDonald's?

1098
03:14:15,280 --> 03:14:19,280
Quarter pounder without cheese.

1099
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:24,280
A quarter pounder without cheese combo.

1100
03:14:25,280 --> 03:14:30,280
Nesty and large fries.

1101
03:14:31,280 --> 03:14:32,280
Dad.

1102
03:14:41,280 --> 03:14:42,280
Nothing.

1103
03:14:44,280 --> 03:14:52,280
Going to college starting this fall, any advice from Kohai on time management and relationships once I start the school year?

1104
03:14:55,280 --> 03:15:01,280
Your time management is based off of your time's table, not like your schedule.

1105
03:15:02,280 --> 03:15:08,280
And your relationships, I recommend setting up specific days where you can hang out with your friends.

1106
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:10,280
For example, I think...

1107
03:15:11,280 --> 03:15:19,280
I had a short day on Fridays, and so I hung out with my friends on Fridays after school, yeah.

1108
03:15:23,280 --> 03:15:26,280
No cheese? Oh, I don't like cheese on my burger.

1109
03:15:27,280 --> 03:15:28,280
Didn't say Nuggies.

1110
03:15:29,280 --> 03:15:33,280
I'm not a huge fan of the Nuggies. They don't taste good without the sauce.

1111
03:15:34,280 --> 03:15:39,280
Are you a fan of McClurry? Oh, I think they're okay, but I don't indulge in them all the time.

1112
03:15:46,280 --> 03:15:47,280
Um, let's see...

1113
03:15:49,280 --> 03:15:55,280
I'm getting too perished social to VTubers. Should I turn it down with watching, just step back or stay as I am?

1114
03:15:55,280 --> 03:15:56,280
I'm afraid of heartbreak.

1115
03:15:57,280 --> 03:15:59,280
I don't know how to answer that to you because the...

1116
03:16:00,280 --> 03:16:08,280
Senpai, I want you to be with me all the time, but if it's not good for your health, step back.

1117
03:16:10,280 --> 03:16:15,280
I honestly don't like McDonald's chicken nuggets.

1118
03:16:16,280 --> 03:16:21,280
So I don't know how Americans can eat it, because it tastes like rubber.

1119
03:16:21,280 --> 03:16:28,280
Um, is it because you don't like ice cream too often, or because McDonald's ice creams are broken all the time?

1120
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:32,280
Um, I guess they're all broken all the time, but they're kind of expensive.

1121
03:16:33,280 --> 03:16:35,280
They're kind of expensive.

1122
03:16:52,280 --> 03:17:01,280
No! It tastes better in Canada. It tastes like chicken, so I don't know what's up with Americans.

1123
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:08,280
But I don't like... Sometimes I just... I don't want to eat something with sauce, right?

1124
03:17:08,280 --> 03:17:14,280
So if the chicken nuggets can't taste good without sauce, then I don't really like it.

1125
03:17:14,280 --> 03:17:19,280
I guess...

1126
03:17:22,280 --> 03:17:30,280
I actually prefer Burger King over McDonald's in terms of like chicken nuggets.

1127
03:17:33,280 --> 03:17:36,280
I think their nuggets are better. Their breading is better.

1128
03:17:36,280 --> 03:17:45,280
But, um, yeah, McDonald's is really expensive. What about Wendy's?

1129
03:17:45,280 --> 03:17:51,280
According to someone who works at Wendy's, I cannot eat Wendy's due to my allergy.

1130
03:17:59,280 --> 03:18:04,280
So if I had to order at McDonald's, since there's a lot of McDonald's around,

1131
03:18:05,280 --> 03:18:14,280
and it's very convenient, I will get myself a quarter pounder or a double hamburger. No cheese.

1132
03:18:21,280 --> 03:18:25,280
Speaking of BK Nuggets, spicy or regular? I kind of like the spicy one.

1133
03:18:26,280 --> 03:18:36,280
What about at Tim Hortons Coal High? Um, like I said, if I go to Tim Hortons, I would order a multi-grain bagel with cream cheese.

1134
03:18:36,280 --> 03:18:38,280
Or just butter, depending on how I feel.

1135
03:18:40,280 --> 03:18:44,280
I think that's fine, but I just don't like cheese on my burgers.

1136
03:18:49,280 --> 03:18:51,280
Let's see...

1137
03:18:55,280 --> 03:19:05,280
Any advice for moving out?

1138
03:19:07,280 --> 03:19:11,280
I am trying to be more independent. Any recommendations for searching for a new cage or saving money?

1139
03:19:11,280 --> 03:19:14,280
If you can't answer, a simple good luck would be nice. Good luck!

1140
03:19:15,280 --> 03:19:20,280
I, uh, haven't ever moved out. I still love all my parents.

1141
03:19:21,280 --> 03:19:26,280
Sorry, Senpai, but good luck to you!

1142
03:19:31,280 --> 03:19:33,280
Let's see...

1143
03:19:38,280 --> 03:19:41,280
Some of these questions are going to be too long to answer.

1144
03:19:51,280 --> 03:20:02,280
Okay, sorry, Senpai, some of these questions are very long, and we've already been here for about, for over three hours now.

1145
03:20:02,280 --> 03:20:27,280
We've been here for over three hours now, so I think, um, I think that should be it for questions.

1146
03:20:27,280 --> 03:20:31,280
Unfortunately, a lot of the questions I got in are a little bit more intimate.

1147
03:20:31,280 --> 03:20:41,280
And I probably wouldn't be able to answer them in a good amount of time.

1148
03:20:42,280 --> 03:20:45,280
But my stomach is growling, Senpai.

1149
03:20:45,280 --> 03:20:50,280
Like, my stomach is growling, and I'm very hungry.

1150
03:20:53,280 --> 03:20:59,280
I'm very hungry, so I'm just going to have to say goodbye for now.

1151
03:21:02,280 --> 03:21:16,280
So, I hope Senpai has a great time.

1152
03:21:17,280 --> 03:21:23,280
Oh, somebody sent me a question again. I'm sorry if it's the long question. I don't think I can answer.

1153
03:21:24,280 --> 03:21:30,280
Okay, maybe I can answer this one.

1154
03:21:30,280 --> 03:21:34,280
What is a good relationship for us viewers to have with you?

1155
03:21:34,280 --> 03:21:36,280
A loving one!

1156
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:39,280
A loving one!

1157
03:21:39,280 --> 03:21:43,280
And it says, uh, if you're willing to break kayfabe again.

1158
03:21:43,280 --> 03:21:50,280
A loving relationship, but please do not become overly attached.

1159
03:21:50,280 --> 03:21:52,280
That is the end.

03:21:53,280 --> 03:22:01,280
Anyway, thanks Senpai for joining me.

1161
03:22:05,280 --> 03:22:11,280
I hope you have a good one. I hope some of these advice helps you or ruins your life. I don't really know.

1162
03:22:15,280 --> 03:22:21,280
So, I'll see you tomorrow's my day off, so I won't see you tomorrow.

1163
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:25,280
I'll see you Wednesday. Wednesday!

1164
03:22:25,280 --> 03:22:28,280
No, no, no, no. It's a normal day.

1165
03:22:28,280 --> 03:22:30,280
Wednesday, I'm playing amori.

1166
03:22:30,280 --> 03:22:35,280
Thursday, I am streaming quite early because of a collab.

1167
03:22:37,280 --> 03:22:42,280
Because of a collab, so please remember the time is different.

1168
03:22:42,280 --> 03:22:50,280
Check the calendar. Check the waiting room that I put up.

1169
03:22:50,280 --> 03:22:54,280
So make sure you can catch it. If you can't catch it, please catch a lot of it.

1170
03:22:54,280 --> 03:22:57,280
I'm sure you have a great time.

1171
03:22:57,280 --> 03:23:03,280
Okay, anyways, goodbye Senpai!

1172
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:05,280
I love you!

1173
03:23:05,280 --> 03:23:08,280
Screen for Mercy!

1174
03:23:20,280 --> 03:23:25,280
Thanks for watching!
