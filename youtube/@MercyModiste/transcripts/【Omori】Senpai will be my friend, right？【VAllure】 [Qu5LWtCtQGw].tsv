1805800	1808920	Getting a bit of money now. They were so worried before
1812920	1814920	Do we have a word of the day

1819760	1825360	How about diligence hmm our word of the day is diligence. Yeah work hard
1829600	1831600	Is
1834680	1839120	That the safe word there's no safe words around me silly it's only safe words around chibi

1859200	1861200	I
1864960	1868280	Hearing she bees hearing is selective when it comes to safe words. Yeah

1881320	1885360	Yeah, any time I keep all of my senpais in my basement
1886240	1889400	My parents are just like all these must be the new students
1908960	1911680	I've tried to explain multiple times every
1912280	1915800	Time it's gets misconstrued like any time
1918400	1921440	Netflix goes down they always
1923480	1925480	They're not very
1925760	1928320	They don't really know about technology, so they're like
1930280	1932280	Sweetie the Netflix is down
1933240	1934760	Netflix is down
1934760	1938160	Can you call Netflix to tell them to bring it back?

1946720	1948720	Yeah, sure
1963600	1967640	That's like give me a second I'll fix this I'll fix this
1968240	1971720	Usually the issue is with my my ISP
1973120	1975120	My ISP so it's not usually
1981040	1982640	So yeah
1982640	1988360	My parents are very sweet people. I love them very much and that's why I really want to be successful
1988600	1992960	So that I can provide for them, but also I kind of want to move out because
1994440	1996760	Well, you know
1998000	2003920	You don't really a lot of privacy when living with your parents because my time is always their time
2006280	2010040	So any time I tell them okay, I'm at work right now
2010840	2018360	I'm at work right now, so I can't I can't do I can't do things until maybe like until I'm done, okay?
2019360	2024240	They don't normally get that and sometimes will interrupt and be like
2028640	2035320	And so I'm just like, okay, okay, we go
2039800	2041800	Honestly, they don't want me to move
2042400	2047640	I've been telling them like oh, yeah, I'm thinking about moving and they're like no no no no no no no no no
2048360	2051040	No, don't move. We need you
2058440	2060440	No, please don't move
2061240	2068680	It's so funny because um, oh my gosh, I'm so I'm I'm yapping. I'm yapping. I haven't even played the game
2070720	2073320	I haven't even played. I'm so sorry. I'm still yapping
2075880	2082320	When when okay, here's a fun fact about about me senpai's I worked I worked in Japan
2082320	2084440	I didn't at an internship or
2084680	2091800	Or um for about three months. Mm-hmm. So I lived in Japan for three months and um
2095880	2102440	And um, I was like, oh, yeah, you know, if I get a job offer here, I'll stay and
2103800	2108200	Mama and Papa were like if you're moving to Japan, we are moving to Japan
2114520	2116520	Oh
2131080	2137800	But I really want to want my privacy because um for patreon and stuff I have to go into like a pretty much, um
2138600	2146120	Uh really a secluded room with like, uh, I put like a bunch of clothing around to to soundproof it a bit
2147320	2149880	It's not ideal. It's not an ideal situation
2153800	2156280	Yeah closet it's pretty much a closet recording
2157400	2164760	So I would really love to like one of my goals is to like move out so that I'll be able to have a space to work
2168680	2170680	Yeah
2175160	2180920	So I'm I'm trying to convince them that if I do move out, I'll I'll I'll move out
2181000	2183640	But I'll be I'll be really close to help them out
2191160	2194120	So all of my audios have been kind of like in a closet. Yeah
2198520	2200520	So don't worry about it
2201560	2205160	It's a little awkward. Yeah, I think I feel like it's a little awkward, but
2206520	2208200	um
2208200	2210840	I am bringing in some money so
2211720	2217000	So they'll be happy and as long as I'm able to pay pay off the bills and stuff
2217080	2219000	I think though they're pretty happy about that
2219960	2221960	like, um
2222200	2224200	For a little bit I have to ask
2224200	2226200	uh, I used to be the one
2226280	2232040	to pay for like gas and electricity and like utilities, but then I
2233480	2236200	I couldn't find a job so
2237720	2239720	So I um
2242360	2245160	I um, I yeah, I la
2246520	2250040	I had to ask them and they were so worried about about it
2250040	2252040	Um
2253640	2256680	Did your sister escape the raft? Oh, yeah
2258120	2260120	Oh, yeah, she oh, yeah, she did
2261080	2262600	the moment

2309480	2313400	But like a lot of places like they just they were like no we have

3160280	3162280	You guys heard that no bosses here
3164600	3166600	Huh
3167720	3170760	What happened? Hold on
3178280	3180280	Why did it die?
3180680	3182680	I
3189560	3191560	Why is it doing this?
3194360	3199560	Okay, it's doing something funky the capture is doing something funky. You guys see that
3200440	3202440	Senpai, do you see that?
3203080	3206840	Yeah, we gotta call Netflix. What the heck is going on? What the heck? Hold on
3207400	3209400	What the heck?
3212360	3214360	Why is it doing that?
3224040	3232680	Hmm, let's reset this uh, let's reset this for a second
3233480	3240520	Maybe I need to make a new uh, capture. Hold on
3255240	3258120	I'm playing uh, I'll Mari off a PC
3263080	3272040	I'm playing it off of PC so it shouldn't be doing anything funky
3277640	3281480	Okay, let's try this and then we'll pull it down
3287400	3290840	Hopefully this stays I'll get rid of this last capture
3293640	3299960	I don't know sometimes it does weird things. Oh no, it's still doing it. Why are you doing that?
3302760	3304760	Why is it doing that?
3310760	3312760	I'm gonna have to just reset the game
3314840	3320200	Let's turn let's uh turn it on and off again
3323240	3329160	That's really weird. I've we've never had it happen before I've never had that happen before
3329720	3332040	Did a driver issue? I don't think so
3339480	3341480	Okay, looks normal
3352680	3354680	Hmm
3361240	3366440	It's still flickering funky. We'll keep an eye on it. I think
3369400	3371400	We'll keep an eye on it
3372680	3374680	I don't know why it's doing this though
3375960	3381000	Um, the reason why I'm confused about why it's doing this is because it's never done this before
3383160	3386360	I'm gonna swing to the moon. I tried to do that once
3391640	3395880	Did the game crash before when I played it it never crashed like this before
3396600	3401800	So I don't think and uh, I can't do a regular game capture because it's
3403800	3405800	Chromium based
3407640	3411000	So I would do a uh window capture instead
3411000	3413000	So, uh
3413240	3416360	A window capture is that it captures a specific window
3416760	3421400	Usually I do a window capture, especially if a game has like a specific cut scene
3421880	3426120	Uh, because sometimes like uh, when you do a game capture a cut scene
3426760	3430360	Uh has something in it, uh, that won't get captured
3430760	3436600	But I am seeing right now that the uh game capture is flickering on in
3437240	3438200	like
3438280	3443480	A lot so I'm worried that it's it's going to be really weird because when it captures the screen
3443800	3448520	There's a yellow border here. Hold on. I'll explain it. There's a yellow border around
3449320	3451320	the uh the window
3451960	3453960	if it's uh
3456760	3462840	If it's capturing it but right now the yellow window like the yellow outlined is uh
3463000	3466440	Uh flashing so it's making me worried
3478440	3481640	So that's why I'm just like, hmm, are you gonna be okay?
3483720	3486280	I wonder if it only happens if I go to this boss thing
3487720	3489720	Now boss zone
3490520	3492520	No, I think it's fine
3493560	3495560	I think it's fine
3495720	3500040	So that's why oh, yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. Let's check
3502040	3506120	Early talk so fast when she's excited. It gets really hard to keep up
3508600	3512440	Nose is my best friend. I can't say much but she's really smart
3515640	3517640	Nose looks occupied

4349560	4351560	Basel, where are you?
4351560	4353560	Can you hear us?
4354560	4355560	Basel?

4357560	4359560	You already won!
4362560	4365560	Hello, Basel!
4373560	4375560	Huh?
4379560	4381560	Hey, there's Basel.
4383560	4385560	Basel, are you okay?
4387560	4389560	Are... are you stuck?
4403560	4405560	Boss, I sure didn't know it was you!
4405560	4407560	You're good for nothing scoundrel!
4407560	4409560	Let Basel go!
4410560	4413560	Yeah, what did Basel ever do to you?
4413560	4415560	Basel's our friend!
4415560	4417560	Don't you dare hurt him!
4417560	4419560	I called Basel, boss.
4419560	4421560	He didn't do anything wrong.
4421560	4423560	Whee!
4423560	4425560	Hehehehe!
4425560	4427560	Hehehehe!
4427560	4429560	Whee!
4436560	4438560	You stupid heads!
4438560	4441560	You think this is about Basel?
4442560	4445560	I did a really cute voice for Boss.
4450560	4452560	Don't play dumb!
4452560	4454560	You know why I'm here!
4454560	4457560	How dare you not invite me to hide and seek!
4458560	4462560	I'm the one who showed you all how to play in the first place!
4467560	4470560	You're not even playing here, right?
4473560	4477560	How can you call it hide and seek without any body slamming?
4479560	4481560	My flower crown!
4481560	4484560	Hey, that's the flower crown we made for Basel!
4484560	4486560	How could you?
4486560	4488560	Let go of him, you bully!
4488560	4489560	No!
4489560	4493560	If I can't play with everyone, then no one can!
4495560	4498560	This is a boss-only zone now!
4498560	4501560	And you're not invited!
4505560	4507560	Alright!
4508560	4510560	Where's my skill?
4510560	4512560	Sad follow-up!
4512560	4514560	Sure.
4514560	4516560	Oh, Aubrey do!
4517560	4519560	Skill.
4519560	4521560	Peptoc.
4525560	4527560	Here, let's do it for him.
4527560	4529560	Oh, Cal-do.
4529560	4531560	And no one.
4531560	4533560	You saw him!
4533560	4535560	Never mind.
4535560	4537560	Actually.
4537560	4538560	Attack.
4538560	4540560	Boss.
4540560	4542560	Oh, Hero-do.
4542560	4543560	No, Cook.
4543560	4545560	Ah, just attack.
4546560	4548560	Oh, Maury, you had a sad poem.
4548560	4550560	Oh, Maury felt sad.
4550560	4552560	Boss attacks.
4552560	4553560	You can do it, Aubrey!
4553560	4554560	Cheers on Hero!
4554560	4556560	You feel happy!
4556560	4557560	Hero attacks Boss.
4557560	4559560	Take 15 damage.
4559560	4562560	Oscar cracks his neck while Maury and friends do fight.
4566560	4567560	It's a boy.
4567560	4569560	Oh, we got nothing.
4573560	4574560	Maury attacks.
4574560	4576560	Takes 20 damage.
4576560	4578560	You weaklings!
4578560	4580560	You call that an attack?
4584560	4585560	Hero attacks Boss.
4585560	4587560	Boss takes 15 damage.
4587560	4588560	Aubrey attacks Boss.
4588560	4590560	Boss takes 17 damage.
4591560	4593560	Hero attacks Boss.
4593560	4595560	Takes 13 damage.
4595560	4597560	Oscar cracks his neck while friends do fight.
4602560	4603560	There we go.
4603560	4604560	Let's keep going.
4604560	4606560	Hey, that kind of hurt!
4606560	4607560	Oof!
4607560	4609560	This isn't fun anymore!
4617560	4620560	Now you've made me angry!
4623560	4626560	It's time for my special move!
4628560	4630560	Bloody slam!
4634560	4637560	Hero took that damage, became toast.
4637560	4639560	Aw, we all became toast.
4639560	4640560	Okay.
4644560	4646560	Maury did not succumb.
4647560	4648560	Huh?
4648560	4650560	How are you still moving?
4650560	4652560	How are you still moving?
4671560	4672560	Yeah.
4675560	4677560	Maury's party was victorious!
4677560	4678560	Yay!
4681560	4683560	He gained 32 AXP.
4683560	4685560	You got 22 clams.
4685560	4687560	Wow, we just robbed this kid too!
4692560	4694560	This isn't fair!
4695560	4696560	Rematch!
4696560	4698560	I want a rematch!
4710560	4712560	Hey, so are you hurt?
4712560	4714560	I'm not worrying about me.
4714560	4716560	I'm just fine.
4717560	4721560	Boss, it must hurt to see people having fun without you.
4721560	4724560	That doesn't mean you can ruin other people's fun.
4725560	4727560	Um, I know that.
4731560	4732560	There.
4732560	4734560	Does that feel better?
4734560	4737560	Hey, so are you sure it's okay to do that?
4737560	4739560	Boss is bad news!
4739560	4744560	It's a good thing Maury held on during the final attack or else we would have all been toast!
4744560	4745560	It's okay.
4745560	4747560	I trust him.
4752560	4756560	When you were all fighting, you tried really hard to make sure I didn't get hurt.
4757560	4759560	Is that true, boss?
4759560	4761560	I'm not sure.
4762560	4764560	Is that true, boss?
4768560	4770560	That's a lot of baloney.
4770560	4773560	I don't need to hear these lies.
4775560	4777560	This is my spot!
4777560	4779560	No one is welcome here!
4784560	4788560	Well, you probably won't be a problem as long as it stays like that.
4788560	4791560	I guess that means we can go to Basil's house now.
4792560	4794560	That sounds good to me.
4795560	4797560	We're leaving now, boss.
4797560	4799560	Don't cause any trouble, okay?
4803560	4805560	Okay, I'm ready.
4805560	4806560	Let's go.
4811560	4813560	Well, let's check in on Boss.
4815560	4817560	Aw, okay.
4818560	4820560	You're gonna swing me in the moon.
4821560	4824560	Come on, man, put your head in it!
4826560	4828560	I like puzzles.
4830560	4833560	I don't like if flowers is someone, but he's only interested in puzzles.
4833560	4836560	I don't like if I find a flower puzzle or something.
4836560	4838560	Maybe he would notice me.
4838560	4839560	Oh.
4849560	4852560	I might need to make more tea soon.
4858560	4860560	Come on, controls!
4860560	4862560	Controls, please let me talk!
4863560	4865560	Oh, friends.
4869560	4871560	The grass feels nice here.
4871560	4873560	Wanna join us, Mari?
4873560	4874560	Yeah.
4875560	4880560	The stars shine brightly overhead.
4880560	4882560	You don't have a care in the world.
4883560	4885560	What's my favorite tea currently?
4885560	4887560	My favorite tea is...
4887560	4889560	Peppermint vanilla.
4894560	4895560	Very nice.
4895560	4896560	Mari learned.
4896560	4897560	Observe.
4899560	4901560	Thanks, perfect nice for stargazing.
4902560	4903560	Banana.
4903560	4905560	Let me touch the banana.
4905560	4907560	Eternal banana.
4910560	4911560	Yes, yes.
4911560	4913560	Hello, valued customer.
4913560	4914560	Welcome to my shop.
4914560	4916560	Please buy something.
4922560	4923560	Candy.
4923560	4925560	A child's favorite food.
4925560	4926560	Sweet.
4926560	4927560	Yoast 30 heart.
4928560	4929560	Apple juice.
4929560	4931560	Apparently better than orange juice.
4931560	4934560	Yoast 25 juice.
4934560	4938560	Jax, Yoast is small damage to offals and reduces their speed.
4938560	4943560	Crescent is not what you wanted and flicks anger on a friend or a foal.
4943560	4947560	I guess I can buy some apple juice.
4948560	4950560	I'll buy apple juice.
4950560	4951560	Thank you kindly.
4951560	4952560	Candy.
4954560	4956560	And I think I have enough for Jax as well.
4959560	4960560	There you go.
4960560	4961560	Whatever.
4965560	4967560	Did you see the shippity guitar I see made?
4967560	4968560	Yeah, I did.
4968560	4969560	It was cute.
4975560	4976560	Hop.
4976560	4977560	And a hop.
4977560	4978560	And a hop.
4978560	4979560	And a hop.
4979560	4980560	And a hop.
4981560	4985560	Having fun takes too much effort to watch my friends have fun is enough for me.
4989560	4990560	Peek-a-boo.
4996560	4997560	I like puzzles.
5000560	5001560	Come on, man.
5001560	5002560	Put your head into it.
5006560	5008560	No, this isn't my best friend.
5009560	5011560	She can't say much, but she's really smart.
5013560	5014560	No, this looks occupied.
5015560	5016560	Okay.
5017560	5018560	Hey, Mori.
5018560	5019560	How are you all doing?
5019560	5023560	Just the other day, Noelle was telling me about a cute little leaf she met.
5023560	5028560	But she tried to be its friend and all I wanted to talk about was how much it hated bunnies.
5028560	5030560	How could someone hate bunnies?
5030560	5032560	I just don't understand some people.
5035560	5036560	Yes, some nutritious candy.
5036560	5037560	Do you like to eat some?
5037560	5039560	You and your friend feel alike now.
5040560	5042560	You want to have a picnic with your friends?
5043560	5044560	No.
5044560	5045560	Not yet.
5051560	5052560	Train station.
5053560	5054560	Can you move forward?
5054560	5055560	It's Basel's house.
5055560	5057560	Maybe we should go to Basel's first?
5061560	5062560	Okay.
5062560	5063560	Basel's house.
5063560	5065560	Maybe we should go to Basel's first?
5068560	5069560	Oh.
5069560	5070560	Watering can.
5072560	5074560	These are sunflowers.
5074560	5077560	I call that because they always face towards the sun.
5077560	5080560	That's how I want to be like.
5080560	5082560	Someone who can always see.
5082560	5084560	Someone who always sees the bright side of things.
5089560	5090560	Watering can.
5090560	5093560	These flowers are called the Lillian of the Valley.
5093560	5098560	It's said that they're able to ward off evil spirit and help people see a brighter future.
5098560	5100560	I guess that's why they remind me of mine.
5100560	5103560	I can always count on her to help me stay positive.
5107560	5108560	What is that?
5108560	5109560	Whoa!
5109560	5111560	What's that ugly plant creature?
5111560	5113560	Don't you know, Cal?
5113560	5114560	That's a sprout mole.
5114560	5116560	Sprout moles are highly intelligent creatures.
5116560	5119560	They also become dangerously vicious when they are lost.
5120560	5123560	Please, Mr. Sprout Mole, stop that.
5123560	5125560	You're stopping all over the flowers.
5135560	5138560	It looks like the sprout mole is angry.
5138560	5141560	Like us, sprout moles can also feel emotions.
5141560	5145560	If the sprout mole is angry, its attack is higher.
5145560	5148560	On the other hand, its lower, its defense.
5148560	5153560	Well, what you're saying is now is the perfect time to strike.
5153560	5155560	Come on, Amore. Let's do this.
5159560	5160560	Why not?
5163560	5165560	We're just gonna kick its ass.
5170560	5171560	Oh.
5171560	5172560	Okay, that wasn't bad.
5174560	5176560	You gained 22 EXP, got three clams.
5176560	5177560	You found tofu.
5177560	5179560	Amore grew to level two.
5186560	5188560	Most of the flowers are unharmed.
5188560	5189560	That's a relief.
5190560	5191560	Hey, Amore.
5192560	5194560	We're getting into the hang of battle.
5194560	5197560	Here's a journal where we can keep track of any neat foals we come across.
5198560	5200560	Nero gave you the full facts journal.
5201560	5203560	There, now it's in your pocket.
5203560	5205560	The journal is yours to record with.
5205560	5208560	Oh, we might pitch in sometimes too.
5208560	5212560	Check it out through your pocket or in the player menu by the pressing B.
5212560	5213560	By pressing B.
5213560	5214560	Alright.
5216560	5217560	Okay.
5217560	5218560	Important.
5218560	5219560	Full facts.
5219560	5220560	Views.
5221560	5222560	A sprout mole.
5222560	5226560	A dangerous and hostile, ugly plant creature.
5226560	5230560	It says it's smart, but they do not believe it is.
5231560	5232560	But do not believe it is not.
5232560	5233560	It smells like dirty laundry.
5233560	5234560	Amore.
5236560	5237560	Alright.
5246560	5247560	Another one!
5248560	5249560	Oh no, not again.
5250560	5252560	Please, Mr. Sprout, don't stop twirling.
5252560	5254560	You're destroying all of the flowers.
5260560	5262560	Oh, I see.
5262560	5264560	This sprout mole is happy.
5264560	5268560	In that case, it has a higher chance to hit our weak spots and do more damage.
5268560	5271560	This also means it has a high chance of missing.
5277560	5278560	Oh.
5291560	5296560	Amore's party was victorious.
5296560	5299560	You got four clams, bountiful.
5303560	5304560	Oh, sorry.
5304560	5306560	I'm going to just adjust some stuff.
5306560	5307560	Hmm.
5307560	5310560	You seem to be running a lot of foals with emotion.
5310560	5314560	In case you didn't know, emotions can determine how strong or weak the attack is.
5314560	5316560	Happy beats angry.
5316560	5318560	Angry beats sad.
5318560	5320560	And sad beats happy.
5320560	5322560	That's depressing!
5322560	5324560	That's depressing!
5325560	5327560	Here, I even drew up a guide on how it works.
5327560	5330560	I'm no artist, but I think it will get to the point.
5330560	5333560	I'll put it in your pocket so you can check it out later.
5334560	5335560	Got a motion chart.
5337560	5338560	You want to look at that motion chart now?
5338560	5339560	Yeah.
5340560	5342560	Oh wait, that's cute.
5345560	5347560	Sad, defense up speed town.
5347560	5350560	Some damage to heart becomes juice.
5350560	5354560	Angry equals attack up and defense down.
5354560	5357560	Happy is luck up, speed up, and rate down.
5359560	5362560	Strong to sad and strong to happy.
5364560	5365560	Happy's weak to strong.
5365560	5366560	Strong.
5366560	5371560	Angry is strong to sad and sad is weak to angry.
5371560	5374560	Happy is strong to angry.
5375560	5377560	And angry is weak to happy.
5377560	5379560	And neutral is just in the middle.
5380560	5384560	Yeah, I'm not an artist, but this is pretty cute, yeah.
5386560	5388560	I want to look at the other flowers.
5389560	5393560	These type of flowers are called gladiose.
5394560	5397560	Gladiose, gladiolus.
5397560	5401560	Wow, I can't read!
5401560	5403560	I can't read!
5405560	5407560	Is the gladiolus what?
5407560	5412560	Gladiolus, also known as the sword flower.
5412560	5415560	As you might guess, it represents a strength of character.
5415560	5418560	A woman who is honest with strong moral values.
5418560	5423560	Someone who stands by the conviction that gladiolus reminds me of Aubrey
5423560	5425560	because she's always true to herself.
5426560	5427560	Oh, I see.
5427560	5430560	But you're saying that Aubrey is really stubborn!
5430560	5432560	Hey, no I'm not!
5433560	5435560	Okay, let's move on.
5439560	5440560	These are roses.
5440560	5442560	Can you guess who they remind me of?
5443560	5445560	They remind me of Hero.
5445560	5446560	Can you guess correctly?
5446560	5451560	Roses come in many different colors and have their own unique meanings.
5451560	5453560	Pink roses represent...
5453560	5455560	Oh, symbolize is admiration.
5455560	5458560	Orange roses symbolize passion.
5458560	5460560	Yellow roses symbolize friendship.
5460560	5461560	The list goes on.
5461560	5464560	Hero doesn't remind me of any rose in particular.
5464560	5468560	Like, heroes like all roses because he's versatile and universally loved.
5469560	5471560	Oh, that's really sweet.
5471560	5474560	You got, like, so many, so many flowers based off of your friends.
5480560	5482560	Whoa, what are these flowers called?
5482560	5484560	They're all cool and spiky!
5484560	5485560	I should tell.
5485560	5487560	This is the cactus.
5487560	5489560	It's more of a plant than a flower.
5489560	5492560	It's funny that you ask because they remind you of you.
5493560	5495560	Is it because he's a prick?
5495560	5496560	Hey!
5496560	5502560	Well, not too, but mostly because cactus are very sturdy and resilient plants by nature.
5503560	5505560	I can't believe!
5505560	5507560	I can't believe!
5507560	5510560	They were like, yeah, it's because you're a prick.
5519560	5524560	That too.
5525560	5529560	They don't need much care and can survive even in seemingly impossible conditions.
5530560	5534560	Guess what I'm saying is that even you could take care of a cactus, Cal.
5534560	5535560	Whoa, neat!
5535560	5537560	Cacti are awesome!
5539560	5543560	Did not even notice the inson there.
5544560	5547240	Ah, these are twice tulips.
5547240	5549240	They are simple and bulbous.
5549240	5550560	Just like a mori.
5550560	5552440	Bul- bulb- bulbus?
5553060	5554560	Bulbas?
5554560	5557240	Water's off a duck's back?
5558560	5560200	Exactly like Shibi.
5560200	5561560	Shibi's, like, so strong.
5561560	5564560	Everything is water off a duck's back.
5573560	5579560	I don't know, I just think it's cute.
5579560	5582560	Oh, Basil, you think I'm cute?
5582560	5583560	Uh-huh.
5590560	5593560	Ah, not another sprout, Mo.
5593560	5594560	Not good, Basil.
5594560	5596560	We gotta hang him this by now.
5596560	5605560	Hmm, this sprout mo seemed a bit sad.
5605560	5608560	See how it's curled up in the fetal position?
5608560	5612560	That means it won't do as much damage as normal.
5612560	5617560	But it'll also take less damage to heart and will lose juice instead.
5617560	5618560	How sad.
5618560	5620560	Let's put it out of its misery.
5620560	5622560	Alright?
5626560	5628560	Hmm.
5643560	5644560	Okay.
5650560	5653560	I'm gonna just keep on attacking, whatever.
5657560	5661560	I'm just like, oh wow, this thing is depressed?
5661560	5663560	Kill it.
5663560	5665560	Alright.
5684560	5686560	Alright.
5694560	5699560	Oh, how'd you get here so fast, Mari?
5704560	5707560	Hi everyone, y'all just came in time for a lovely picnic.
5707560	5709560	Feel free to rest here.
5709560	5712560	Everything is already all set up and I even brought some fruit.
5712560	5714560	Alright.
5714560	5717560	Let's have a picnic with our friends.
5718560	5720560	Cute.
5728560	5731560	Delicious fruit, would you like to eat some?
5735560	5738560	I mean, your friends feel like new.
5738560	5740560	Munch, munch, munch, munch.
5740560	5743560	Whoa, thanks, Mari, you're the best.
5743560	5745560	Oh, it's nothing.
5745560	5748560	I'm gonna look out for all of you.
5748560	5751560	Ah, Mari, I wish it could be more like you.
5751560	5754560	You always seem to have everything under control.
5754560	5756560	That's not true at all.
5756560	5758560	It just seems that way from the outside.
5758560	5763560	Either way, you sure seem to make everything look easy.
5763560	5765560	Yes, I agree.
5765560	5769560	Mari is effortlessly graceful.
5769560	5772560	Don't you think so, Mari?
5776560	5779560	Oh, Mari, stop kidding around.
5779560	5782560	Is there any way to treat your big sister?
5782560	5785560	I have straight down this way.
5785560	5787560	Are we all ready to go?
5787560	5789560	I'm ready when you are.
5789560	5792560	I'll catch you later, Mari.
5792560	5794560	Let me know if you need anything.
5794560	5796560	You soon.
5798560	5801560	Well, let's see if we can save here.
5805560	5815560	I want to say no because I was like, nah.
5815560	5817560	It's the same thing.
5821560	5824560	Oh, shoot, I'm going the wrong direction.
5824560	5826560	I wanted to see before we go to Basil's house
5826560	5829560	if there's anything on the other areas
5829560	5832560	or if they're just blocked off, too.
5832560	5834560	Give us a second.
5837560	5841560	I feel like Basil's house is actually like a final area,
5841560	5843560	so I'm just going to check.
5843560	5845560	Mari, we're supposed to go to my house.
5845560	5847560	Let's just pass the cell.
5847560	5851560	And let's finish finding some little sprouts
5851560	5853560	and why don't you show everyone?
5853560	5855560	Come on, they're really cute.
5855560	5858560	Transportation station doesn't seem to be in service.
5862560	5864560	Okay, well, I guess we'll go to your house.
5864560	5866560	Never mind, I wanted to find the little puzzle,
5866560	5868560	but okay, it's fine.
5868560	5870560	It's fine.
5880560	5882560	Get back over here.
5882560	5884560	Thank you.
5893560	5895560	Okay, we saved already, so it's fine.
5895560	5897560	Let's just go.
5900560	5902560	What is that?
5905560	5908560	What the hecky-wecky?
5915560	5918560	What emotion is this feeling, Engie?
5918560	5921560	What emotion is this feeling, Engie?
5921560	5924560	What emotion is this feeling, Engie?
5947560	5949560	What was...
5949560	5952560	What was this feeling, Engie?
5952560	5954560	No.
5963560	5966560	Why do you like major damage?
5966560	5968560	Help.
5969560	5971560	Oh.
5976560	5978560	Yeah.
5979560	6005560	I really couldn't tell what emotions I was feeling.
6005560	6023560	Oh man, this fight is pretty tough.
6023560	6026560	Don't worry, we can do this if we work together.
6026560	6030560	Looks like I'm going to have to teach you all a little bit about teamwork.
6030560	6032560	Let's try it again, Amore.
6032560	6037560	We'll get him this time.
6037560	6039560	You notice anything different, Amore?
6039560	6043560	You should see a new bar at the bottom of the screen with the number on the side.
6043560	6045560	It's our collective energy.
6045560	6048560	By using our energy, we can beat this ball together.
6048560	6050560	Just attack and you'll see.
6052560	6054560	Like this.
6079560	6082560	It...
6082560	6085560	Hold on.
6085560	6087560	You see the bubble that popped up when we attacked?
6087560	6088560	That's called follow-up.
6088560	6094560	If you attack for a limited time, you can use energy to perform a follow-up.
6094560	6096560	Press any direction...
6096560	6098560	Direction or arrow and see what happens.
6098560	6100560	Alright?
6108560	6125560	No, why didn't it work?
6125560	6128560	Huh.
6128560	6129560	That cost three energy.
6129560	6130560	Oh, I see.
6130560	6131560	Ew.
6131560	6133560	Man, this guy's really tough.
6133560	6137560	When you attack this, did you notice that our energy went up?
6137560	6140560	When we take damage, we can also gain energy.
6140560	6143560	Think of it as a chance to make a comeback.
6143560	6145560	Alright.
6145560	6174560	Okay, so cost three, so that's why they're not...
6174560	6176560	Okay.
6176560	6178560	Nice, we're full of energy.
6178560	6184560	Every time we use our special attack, Mari, after you attack, press to release energy.
6184560	6186560	Okay, it's the... this button?
6186560	6187560	Okay.
6187560	6188560	Up here already?
6188560	6189560	Come on, everyone.
6189560	6191560	Show this big guy what we're made of.
6205560	6214560	Did I do the wrong one?
6214560	6215560	Oh, I pressed the wrong one.
6215560	6216560	It was down.
6216560	6217560	Oops.
6217560	6221560	I thought when I said press the directional button, I was like, okay, I just pressed the
6221560	6224560	directional button because it's pressable.
6224560	6229560	Not bad.
6229560	6233560	Whatever, I can do it again.
6233560	6243560	My bad.
6243560	6255560	That was my bad.
6255560	6261560	Whatever.
6261560	6262560	Learn stab him.
6262560	6264560	Operate group to three, level three.
6264560	6273560	Hero group to level three, yeah.
6273560	6274560	And there you have it.
6274560	6277560	Geralt's battle tutorial 101.
6277560	6282560	And I'm sure that we fight more battles, our team work will improve over time.
6282560	6286560	Oh, you guys, that was so amazing.
6286560	6288560	Yeah, that was nothing.
6288560	6290560	I could have taken...
6290560	6292560	I could have taken away better gear guys than that.
6292560	6295560	I should teach you some of my skills one of those days.
6295560	6300560	Basil, I know you're not the type that likes to fight, but it's good to know how to defend
6300560	6302560	yourself, too.
6302560	6306560	You know, I've actually been working on a book all about battles.
6306560	6308560	Maybe we can all study together next time.
6308560	6311560	I'll give it to Omori to hold on for now.
6311560	6318560	I'm just the pack mule, hey?
6319560	6324560	Yes, we get stronger, I'll be updating the follow-up section of the self-help guide,
6324560	6327560	so you should just check it out every now and then.
6327560	6334560	Omori, you should know when we gain EXP and level up, sometimes we also learn skill.
6334560	6338560	Skills are powerful and have a wide range of effects, but each of us can only remember
6338560	6340560	up to four skills at a time.
6340560	6345560	After you learn a new skill, don't forget to equip it from the player menu, okay?
6345560	6347560	Yeah, yeah, we know.
6347560	6349560	We got a Basil's house now.
6349560	6351560	Okay, that's all I had to say.
6351560	6353560	Ah, Patience Kale.
6353560	6354560	Kale?
6354560	6355560	Kale?
6355560	6357560	I'm calling him Kale.
6361560	6365560	There was an old lady who lived in a shoe.
6365560	6368560	What was that nursery rhyme again?
6368560	6370560	I totally forgot.
6370560	6377560	Hey, cheese!
6377560	6382560	Hold on, let me look it up.
6382560	6385560	Let me look it up.
6385560	6389560	Oh, lady who lived...
6389560	6391560	Okay.
6394560	6396560	Okay, let's see.
6396560	6399560	There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.
6399560	6402560	She had so many children she didn't know what to do.
6402560	6404560	She gave them some broth and a big slice of bread.
6404560	6407560	She kissed them all soundly and sent them to bed.
6407560	6409560	There you go.
6409560	6413560	Do you guys know that nursery rhyme?
6413560	6427560	That's not the version you know.
6427560	6431560	What version did you have now?
6431560	6433560	Well, it came out kind of blurry.
6433560	6435560	Well, it's okay, it gives character.
6435560	6437560	If you don't mind the photo.
6437560	6440560	Of course we don't mind, I won't see it.
6440560	6442560	Oh, sure thing.
6444560	6447560	Y'all look so cute!
6447560	6450560	Now's my hair.
6450560	6457560	I wanna see, I wanna see!
6457560	6462560	Oh, hey Amari, you wanna look at the photo too?
6462560	6471560	Yeah, it is blurry.
6471560	6474560	Whip them all soundly and pop them to bed is the one I know.
6474560	6478560	Oh, okay, okay, I guess.
6478560	6481560	Okay, okay, I...
6481560	6484560	Okay, well that one's a little darker.
6484560	6490560	I definitely learned the version I just read.
6490560	6492560	See how it came out kind of blurry?
6492560	6494560	But you can...
6494560	6496560	But y'all still look so cute.
6496560	6500560	I should add it to my collection.
6501560	6505560	Oh, woohoo, another shot for the full album.
6505560	6507560	Oh, Wolver, Amari, I can't see.
6507560	6509560	Hey, stop pushing!
6509560	6511560	You already had your turn!
6511560	6513560	Get out of my way, Cal!
6513560	6516560	Wait, wait, wait, hold on, there's no need to fight.
6516560	6517560	Me first!
6517560	6519560	No, me!
6521560	6523560	Ah, stop it!
6523560	6525560	You guys are knocking me over.
6531560	6533560	Uh, oops.
6533560	6536560	Oh my gosh, Basel!
6536560	6538560	Basel, we're so sorry!
6538560	6540560	You okay, Basel?
6540560	6542560	You two are in big trouble now.
6542560	6545560	This is why both of you need to learn how to get along.
6545560	6548560	I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, hero.
6548560	6550560	Please don't tell Amari.
6550560	6553560	It's okay, don't worry about it.
6557560	6559560	Accidents happened.
6562560	6565560	Here's your photos.
6565560	6568560	It doesn't look like any of them got damaged.
6568560	6571560	Let's put them back in your photo album together.
6571560	6573560	You hero?
6575560	6578560	Let's go inside my house first.
6578560	6581560	Remember to wipe your feet before you come in.
6581560	6584560	Everybody, wipe your feet before you go in, okay?
6587560	6590560	Wait a second, hold on.
6590560	6592560	Is there anything around here?
6592560	6594560	Anything special? No.
6594560	6596560	Okay, we just go in though.
6596560	6597560	Wipe your feet!
6597560	6599560	You guys wiping?
6600560	6602560	Zephyze, wipe your feet!
6604560	6606560	Basel's photo album.
6606560	6608560	It's the most precious belonging.
6609560	6611560	Are you ready to put the photo?
6611560	6613560	Put back the photos Amari?
6613560	6614560	Yeah.
6616560	6618560	Yeah, let's get started.
6620560	6623560	I don't think I remember the order of these photos.
6623560	6625560	No, I'm not a thing, Basel.
6625560	6627560	Amari has really good memories, I'm sure.
6627560	6629560	We'll figure this out in no time.
6629560	6631560	Lies in me!
6641560	6643560	Oh.
6650560	6652560	I think it was this one.
6660560	6662560	Or not, hold on.
6662560	6664560	Wait, no, I need to put it back!
6667560	6669560	I wanted to...
6680560	6682560	Okay.
6682560	6684560	Is that correct?
6684560	6686560	Basel's memory.
6686560	6688560	There, it's new.
6692560	6694560	Really sorry for pushing you over, Basel.
6694560	6697560	Even though at least half of it was Kels' fault.
6697560	6699560	Yeah, I promise.
6699560	6701560	Never to ever, to never fall for it.
6701560	6703560	I'm sorry.
6703560	6705560	I'm sorry.
6705560	6707560	I'm sorry.
6707560	6709560	I'm sorry.
6709560	6713560	Ever, to never fight with Aubrey ever again, unless she starts this first.
6715560	6717560	No worry about it.
6717560	6721560	I know you only wanted to see my photo album.
6721560	6724560	Thank you for helping me put it back together.
6732560	6734560	That's strange.
6734560	6736560	Photo must have been loose.
6736560	6738560	Huh? What's this?
6738560	6740560	Can I take this photo?
6741560	6743560	Something about it seems...
6744560	6746560	...well familiar.
6748560	6750560	No, no.
6750560	6752560	I can't be.
6754560	6756560	My face!
6760560	6762560	Huh?
6764560	6766560	Meow?
6766560	6769560	What do you do around here, is there?
6769560	6772560	Get you a box for wiping your sorrows away.
6772560	6774560	Your sketchbook.
6774560	6776560	Take a look inside.
6778560	6780560	You only got...
6780560	6782560	Oh, what the heck is that? That's new.
6784560	6786560	You booted up your laptop.
6786560	6788560	What'd you like to do?
6788560	6790560	Look at your screen.
6790560	6792560	Let's share it at the screen.
6792560	6794560	In your journal.
6797560	6799560	Everything? Okay.
6802560	6805560	The heat from the laptop warmed your lap.
6805560	6807560	It felt nice.
6826560	6828560	Meow?
6841560	6843560	Meow? Or is there?
6844560	6846560	For a way out?
6846560	6848560	There's one.
6848560	6850560	But...
6850560	6852560	Meow? Waiting for something to happen?
6856560	6858560	Light bulb hangs from the ceiling.
6858560	6860560	Wherever it is.
6860560	6862560	Looking for light bulb?
6865560	6867560	It's black inside.
6867560	6869560	You can't see a thing.
6872560	6874560	Cow!
6879560	6881560	Oh, what?
6886560	6888560	Cat?
6888560	6890560	What do you say?
6892560	6894560	Something you do?
6897560	6899560	I would just ignore it.
6901560	6903560	But...
6909560	6911560	when all those red things, they're like cans
6911560	6913560	and it brings you back to the beginning.
6916560	6932560	Oh, there's more of them.
6932560	6956560	I can't remember.
6956560	6985560	Oh, there's more.
6985560	6994560	Huh.
6994560	7012560	Kat, tell me what the fuck I need to do.
7012560	7016560	What's my charm?
7016560	7034560	What do I need to like?
7034560	7063560	Never mind.
7063560	7066560	There's a stab one here.
7066560	7069560	Dab? Who? Stab me?
7069560	7071560	Okay.
7071560	7085560	Okay.
7085560	7097560	Ow.
7097560	7099560	Are you gonna take it? Yeah?
7099560	7108560	Look at all of us.
7108560	7120560	There are all our memories together.
7120560	7127560	They're a little sad now.
7127560	7132560	But we should be happy that they happened at all.
7132560	7135560	Oh, Zerah's in chat?
7135560	7160560	Let's make some new memories together, okay?
7160560	7163560	You see a boy sleeping in his room.
7163560	7166560	What's his name?
7166560	7171560	You guys want to be sunny?
7171560	7176560	I guess we got a default name.
7176560	7183560	Or should I go for a regular?
7183560	7189560	Regular name. You guys want to be...
7189560	7191560	Does my senpai want to be...
7191560	7204560	You want to be senpai? Okay.
7204560	7206560	That's uppercase senpai.
7206560	7208560	S
7208560	7211560	E
7211560	7213560	N
7213560	7215560	D
7215560	7217560	A
7217560	7223560	I
7223560	7225560	The boy's name is senpai?
7225560	7245560	Yeah.
7245560	7247560	Hey senpai, it's mommy.
7247560	7251560	I'm still in the city setting things up for our new home.
7251560	7253560	Did you finish packing yet?
7253560	7255560	Movers are going to be at our house in a few days,
7255560	7258560	so I left a list of things for you to do before they arrive.
7258560	7260560	Oh, so sorry. Mommy messed up.
7260560	7262560	I forgot to tell you the electric company
7262560	7265560	that we need a few extra days before we're ready to move,
7265560	7268560	so the lights might be cut out sometime tonight.
7268560	7272560	Anyway, I know moving to a new place can be a little nerve-wracking right now,
7272560	7277560	but I think a change of scenery will be positive for both of us.
7277560	7279560	I know you haven't talked to anyone in a while,
7279560	7282560	but you might want to say goodbye to your old friends before we leave.
7282560	7285560	How's it going to have... has been really...
7285560	7288560	I've been really... that's what I can't read right now.
7292560	7295560	How's it been trying really hard to get ahold of you
7295560	7298560	ever since we put our house up for sale?
7298560	7301560	He's been calling us every week for the past few months.
7301560	7303560	He seems a little lonely.
7303560	7305560	Maybe he should pay him a visit.
7305560	7307560	Okay, that's it for now.
7307560	7310560	Mommy loves you. Bye, honey.
7311560	7312560	Zzz.
7315560	7317560	You are hungry.
7318560	7319560	An old computer.
7320560	7321560	A bunch of books.
7323560	7326560	Cardboard boxes littered across the house.
7327560	7329560	Or a drope.
7329560	7332560	An ordinary house plan. Nothing special about it.
7333560	7334560	Table lamp.
7334560	7341440	Mums, do you know- Hi senpai, this is a note from mommy.
7341440	7344640	I left some food in this fridge for you downstairs.
7344640	7346240	It's steak, your favorite.
7346240	7347240	Love you!
7347240	7350240	Hugs and kisses.
7350240	7353240	Mums, to-do list.
7353240	7360560	I don't feel like doing chores right now.
7361560	7364560	A bathtub.
7364560	7366560	It's me.
7366560	7370560	Hi senpai, this is a note from mommy.
7370560	7372560	Remember to brush your teeth every day.
7372560	7374560	Love you!
7374560	7376560	Hugs and kisses.
7376560	7378560	Towels and toiletries.
7378560	7379560	Toilet.
7379560	7380560	Haha, it's shibby!
7380560	7381560	I mean-
7386560	7389560	She's gonna fucking kill me.
7389560	7391560	She's gonna fucking kill me.
7399560	7401560	She's gonna fucking kill me.
7405560	7407560	No, don't tell Ezra!
7410560	7412560	She's gonna fucking kill me.
7412560	7414560	Are you not here for me for a few days?
7414560	7415560	Yeah.
7415560	7418560	I'm trapped in Wonderland, okay?
7419560	7421560	Hahaha!
7432560	7435560	This is ma, a big houseland.
7435560	7440560	One of two old grandfather couples.
7440560	7443560	They stopped working a long time ago, but mom likes to keep them around.
7443560	7448560	What case has been cleared out?
7448560	7450560	A nary houseplant.
7450560	7452560	Nothing special, wow.
7452560	7453560	About it.
7453560	7455560	Yeah!
7455560	7461560	Yeah, I feel like shibby is gonna kill me.
7461560	7464560	She's gonna fucking murder me.
7464560	7466560	I mean, I'll hear me for a week.
7466560	7468560	You know why?
7468560	7470560	I'll come back, though.
7470560	7474560	I'll just get, I'll get Emmy to bring me back.
7474560	7476560	I'll get Emmy to bring me back.
7476560	7478560	That's no problem.
7480560	7482560	Carver box is littered across the house.
7482560	7484560	This empty picnic basket.
7484560	7486560	Would you like to save?
7486560	7488560	Yeah.
7489560	7492560	Oh, now I'm colored in.
7492560	7495560	Some family photos.
7495560	7498560	Carver boxes are littered across the house.
7499560	7504560	Mom said, the mattress is too hard for you to sleep comfortably.
7514560	7516560	It's fine, it's fine.
7516560	7517560	Probably.
7517560	7520560	Are you sure you want to go downstairs?
7521560	7523560	What do you mean, are you sure?
7523560	7525560	I checked everything up here, right?
7525560	7527560	No?
7527560	7529560	Is there things I didn't see?
7531560	7533560	Okay, well, sure, whatever.
7539560	7540560	What, no?
7540560	7542560	Why not?
7543560	7544560	Ah, metal!
7544560	7545560	Metal!
7545560	7547560	Metal's ringing!

7621560	7623560	Or what did you do?
7628560	7631560	I'm so glad, thank you!
7634560	7636560	I played Zero Escape.
7636560	7640560	Oh my gosh, I love the Nonary series.
7640560	7644560	I'm bad at numbers, but I love the Nonary series.
7644560	7649560	When I first got nine persons, nine doors, nine hours,
7649560	7651560	I don't remember the order it was in.
7651560	7655560	I literally thought I only had nine hours to complete it.
7658560	7660560	So I was like putting it off for a while.
7660560	7663560	Turns out, you know, that's just the story
7663560	7667560	and I didn't actually need only nine hours to play
7667560	7670560	when I played it on DS.
7670560	7673560	I got it gifted by a friend.
7675560	7678560	That's like, oh no!
7678560	7681560	Oh my gosh, I thought, oh my god, no,
7681560	7683560	I thought the escape parts were time to nine,
7683560	7686560	but it's two, me too!
7693560	7696560	Me too, I thought, I thought I only had nine,
7696560	7699560	like literally nine hours to just do it.
7702560	7703560	So it was rough.
7703560	7704560	It was rough times.
7704560	7706560	But yeah, I'm glad, I'm glad.
7706560	7709560	Are you pretty far into it?
7709560	7711560	It's such a fun game.
7711560	7713560	It's such a fun game.
7713560	7714560	I've completed the entire series,
7714560	7716560	so I don't think I'll stream it.
7716560	7720560	But if you guys want to check out the Nonary's Zero Escape,
7720560	7724560	check out Merrill playing it.
7724560	7725560	It's probably fun.
7725560	7726560	It's probably lots of fun.
7726560	7728560	I think it's lots of fun.
7728560	7730560	I said probably because I was nervous,
7730560	7732560	some pies would be like, oh, I don't know.
7732560	7734560	Puzzle games, that's not my thing.
7734560	7737560	But guess what? Puzzle games are my thing.
7737560	7738560	I'm a second game now.
7738560	7740560	It's been big fun so far.
7740560	7741560	Yeah!
7741560	7743560	Did you stream the first game too?
7743560	7745560	I'm sure people would love to see a lot of it.
7752560	7753560	Mercy, have you played Ibb?
7753560	7754560	Yeah, I played Ibb.
7754560	7757560	Not the new one, where they extended a lot of stuff,
7757560	7761560	but like the old one.
7761560	7762560	When it was free.
7762560	7766560	When Ibb was free, I played it when it was free.
7766560	7769560	Like a long, long time ago.
7769560	7771560	I did, yeah, I finished the first one on stream.
7771560	7773560	Yeah, everybody go check that out, okay?
7773560	7774560	Check out the first one,
7774560	7778560	and then check out the playthrough for Merrill's one.
7778560	7779560	Yeah, I love puzzle games.
7779560	7781560	It's so fun.
7781560	7783560	Thank you so much for the raid once again.
7783560	7784560	I really appreciate it.
7784560	7786560	Right now, we gotta figure out
7786560	7789560	how to go down the stairs.
7789560	7790560	I have some studying to do.
7790560	7793560	I'll be looking to have a big fun stream, Mercy.
7793560	7795560	Okay, good luck with your study.
7795560	7798560	Work hard and get those grades up.
7798560	7800560	A plus all around.
7805560	7806560	Wee!
7806560	7809560	And now the rest of you are with me.
7809560	7816560	Yeah, I'm winking, but you can't tell
7816560	7821560	because I am wearing an eye patch.
7821560	7825560	So let's continue.
7825560	7829560	So, can I not go downstairs?
7840560	7843560	Hmm.
7846560	7850560	Isn't the beach this bathtub?
7853560	7858560	I feel like I literally have gone through everything.
7858560	7859560	Why not?
7859560	7861560	Get your ass down there.
7861560	7863560	Close your eyes.
7864560	7869560	You feel dizzy.
7869560	7870560	Maybe you can sleep it off.
7870560	7872560	No, go downstairs.
7872560	7874560	Okay, fine.
7874560	7875560	Fine, fine.
7875560	7877560	We'll go back to bed.
7877560	7879560	A little.
7885560	7888560	Now, I guess I have to go to sleep.
7893560	7895560	No, you definitely are hungry.
7895560	7897560	Get the fuck out of bed.
7905560	7908560	You've a glowing light, what?
7924560	7926560	Oh, look!
7926560	7929560	Senpai, do you need a hand?
7932560	7934560	Are stairs always as steep?
7934560	7936560	Well, maybe if you're scared of them.
7941560	7943560	No, you can do it.
7954560	7957560	That's a real hand!
7962560	7965560	That's a real hand.
7965560	7968560	Go away, go away, go away.
7968560	7970560	Okay.
7977560	7979560	What will Senpai do?
7979560	7981560	Senpai, what are you going to do?
7984560	7986560	Something.
7993560	7994560	Can I run?
7994560	7996560	Can I only fight?
7996560	7997560	Okay.
8004560	8005560	No.
8014560	8016560	Senpai.
8040560	8042560	Take a deep breath.
8042560	8044560	Don't be afraid.
8044560	8047560	It's not as scary as you think.
8047560	8049560	You steady yourself.
8049560	8051560	Remember how to calm down.
8051560	8053560	I'm still sick, man.
8053560	8055560	Oh, we made it down the stairs.
8055560	8057560	Woo!
8082560	8084560	Well, it's fine.
8084560	8088560	Think of me to calm down, Senpai.
8088560	8091560	You were thinking about me, right?
8091560	8094560	You got a first aid kit.
8098560	8101560	The case has been cleared out.
8103560	8105560	Why not?
8105560	8108560	Okay, well, let's...
8111560	8113560	No.
8120560	8123560	Look in the fridge and found cold steak.
8123560	8125560	Take it.
8125560	8127560	You got cold steak.
8127560	8130560	Probably should heat it up before you eat it.
8130560	8133560	I'll grab the knife after.
8133560	8136560	The cold steak in the microwave.
8142560	8145560	You got microwave steak.
8146560	8149560	Where's my steak?
8151560	8154560	You pick up the steak knife.
8156560	8159560	Yes, a lovingly well done steak.
8159560	8161560	Would you like to eat something?
8161560	8163560	Yeah.
8172560	8174560	What's Chat's favorite...
8174560	8176560	I'm not Chat, sorry.
8176560	8179560	Oh, have it die hard.
8179560	8182560	Senpai, what's your favorite food?
8182560	8185560	Actually, I already know, but...
8187560	8190560	Your stomach didn't agree with that.
8196560	8199560	Well, time to find the toilet.
8201560	8203560	That was mom's room.
8203560	8205560	Bathroom is this one.
8205560	8207560	Time to barf.
8209560	8211560	Bleurgh.
8231560	8233560	Mercy lemonade?
8235560	8237560	What?
8237560	8239560	Mercy lemonade is what?
8242560	8244560	Let's see.
8251560	8253560	Icy lemonade!
8253560	8255560	Where are you guys?
8255560	8258560	Where's Senpai's getting these lemonades from?
8261560	8263560	Yeah, yeah, it's a drink.
8263560	8266560	Not food, but I mean, I guess if it's your favorite,
8266560	8269560	I can treat you to more.
8272560	8274560	The air-cooler lemonade stand.
8288560	8290560	Oh my god.
8290560	8292560	Oh my gosh.
8292560	8295560	What's the price for lemonade nowadays?
8295560	8299560	It used to be 25 cents for a cup back in...
8299560	8301560	back in the old days.
8309560	8311560	I prefer milk.
8311560	8313560	Azura.
8313560	8315560	Okay, we can sell milk on the side too.
8315560	8317560	This is a startup.
8317560	8320560	We're gonna do a violour lemonade stand.
8325560	8328560	So, milk costs maybe like...
8328560	8331560	How much does milk cost nowadays?
8331560	8334560	I usually leave the shop into mama.
8334560	8336560	Mama and papa.
8338560	8340560	Milk spoil is easy though.
8340560	8343560	Okay, well maybe we can do like...
8343560	8346560	like, you know, we take that milk
8346560	8349560	and then we make it into ice cream with the lemonade.
8349560	8352560	So then we have like a lemonade swirl.
8352560	8354560	Yeah?
8354560	8356560	And then we package it.
8359560	8361560	Now we package it.
8369560	8372560	Now we package it and then we sell it at the...
8372560	8374560	at the lemonade stand.
8375560	8377560	We'll run it illegally of course.
8377560	8379560	We won't get a business license.
8389560	8391560	Self-squeezed.
8393560	8395560	Oh my gosh.
8396560	8399560	Azura, Azura should definitely...
8399560	8403560	should definitely like be the brains of this operation.
8403560	8406560	Freshly, fresh milk...
8408560	8411560	Fresh milk with every pop.
8411560	8414560	I can't even mimic Azura's voice.
8414560	8418560	Fresh milk with every drop.
8418560	8421560	Azura's so much better.
8439560	8443560	I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.
8443560	8446560	I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.
8446560	8449560	I'm not as good as Sheeby when it comes to like voice impersonations.
8449560	8452560	Yes, we all want Azura's milks.
8464560	8467560	Azura could probably crash the milk market.
8467560	8469560	Yeah.
8469560	8473560	I swear if Azura like came...
8474560	8477560	Simpa, you know the mega milk shirt?
8477560	8481560	Like, I feel like, you know, Azura would like be...
8481560	8484560	you know, ultra milk or something.
8486560	8488560	Mercy milk would be competitor?
8488560	8491560	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
8491560	8496560	You haven't tried warm, delicious Azura milk yet.
8498560	8500560	Okay?
8504560	8507560	So everyone, we're going to...
8507560	8510560	Simpa, we're going to pitch this idea to Strony.
8510560	8514560	It's going to be a new business venture and we're going to make millions.
8514560	8517560	Okay? We're going to be millionaires.
8524560	8527560	Have you tried warm, delicious Azura milk?
8527560	8529560	Of course.
8529560	8531560	Everyone in Bielor has.
8533560	8535560	Hahaha.
8540560	8544560	Can we get GamerSup's cup with you guys on it?
8544560	8547560	Well, I don't know.
8547560	8551560	You'll have to probably pass that idea on to Strony
8551560	8554560	or I don't know, harass GamerSup.
8554560	8557560	No, actually do not harass GamerSup's for it.
8557560	8559560	That was a joke.
8563560	8566560	That's a joke, but like, you know, that's a joke.
8566560	8568560	I promise that part was a joke.
8568560	8574560	If anyone does it, I relinquish all responsibility for that.
8574560	8576560	Thank you.
8581560	8584560	No, no, no, no, no, do it.
8585560	8590560	But yeah, everyone in Bielor has tried...
8591560	8594560	Azura milk.
8594560	8599560	And I think everyone should too, especially if you're a bleeding heart.
8599560	8602560	I know. Is it bleeding heart?
8602560	8606560	Oh, I'm so bad. I'm forgetting fan names.
8615560	8617560	Yeah, it's bleeding hearts.
8617560	8619560	Okay, whoo.
8621560	8622560	Whoo, whoo, whoo.
8622560	8626560	I was like, am I mismer... remembering things?
8632560	8636560	Well, we'll bring this, we'll make millions, millions.
8637560	8640560	If I get into Gen 2, can we get Azura milk?
8640560	8642560	Of course, only if you get into Gen 2.
8642560	8644560	But first, pay attention to Gen 1.
8644560	8646560	Us, okay? Us.
8646560	8650560	We just came out, come on, you already want the next big thing?
8650560	8652560	I'll fucking kill you.
8653560	8655560	Oh, sorry, that sounded more like Serani.
8656560	8657560	Okay?
8659560	8661560	I'll kill you.
8665560	8666560	And then...
8668560	8670560	there won't be a Senpai anymore.
8670560	8672560	So pay attention to us.
8673560	8674560	First.
8675560	8678560	Enjoy us, what do we... when we can.
8683560	8685560	But what if I like being stabbed?
8685560	8687560	Then you won't get stabbed, easy peasy, right?
8687560	8689560	Isn't that punishment enough?
8694560	8696560	So, be good. Be good.
8696560	8697560	Let's...
8697560	8699560	We'll cross the bridge when we get there.
8699560	8702560	Right now, you have to pay attention to me.
8703560	8704560	Azura.
8704560	8705560	Chibi.
8705560	8706560	Icy.
8708560	8709560	Emi.
8709560	8710560	Stroni.
8710560	8712560	Understudi.
8717560	8718560	I'm sorry.
8718560	8719560	I'm sorry.
8719560	8720560	I'm sorry.
8720560	8721560	I'm sorry.
8721560	8722560	I'm sorry.
8722560	8723560	I'm sorry.
8724560	8725560	Good.
8725560	8727560	Good Senpai.
8727560	8728560	Good.
8728560	8731560	Good boys and good girls.
8732560	8734560	I'm glad we have our understanding.
8735560	8737560	How could you talk about anyone else?
8737560	8739560	Even a figurative anyone else.
8740560	8741560	You need us right now.
8741560	8744560	That's all you need right now is us.
8744560	8746560	So, no more of that.
8746560	8748560	We'll cross that bridge when we get there.
8748560	8751560	And that's not for at least another year.
8754560	8756560	So, shh.
8756560	8757560	Shhh.
8757560	8758560	Shhh.

8774560	8775560	Good.
8775560	8777560	I'm good.
8777560	8779560	Good Senpai.
8780560	8782560	You're so kind and trusting.
8782560	8784560	I knew you would understand.
8787560	8788560	Alright.
8788560	8789560	So we just threw up.
8795560	8796560	You threw up.
8796560	8797560	Yep.
8797560	8798560	Yep.
8798560	8799560	Thought so.
8802560	8803560	Hahaha.
8805560	8806560	Can we flush it?
8806560	8807560	I threw up.
8807560	8808560	I threw up.
8808560	8809560	Mom, I threw up.
8811560	8812560	Hahaha.
8812560	8813560	Stanny.
8813560	8815560	Imagine standing outside of Adrien's garden.
8815560	8816560	Mom, me?
8817560	8818560	I threw up.
8818560	8819560	Wait, what?
8822560	8823560	No, let me back down!
8828560	8829560	What the heck?
8832560	8833560	Hey.
8833560	8835560	Hey Senpai, it's Mari.
8835560	8836560	Hahaha.
8839560	8841560	I'm finally back home, but I forgot my keys.
8841560	8843560	Could you open the door for me?
8844560	8845560	Yeah, sure!
8855560	8856560	Open the door!
8856560	8857560	Open the door!
8871560	8873560	Stop having it be closed.
8877560	8878560	Hahaha.
8879560	8880560	Oops.
8881560	8882560	Spooky.
8886560	8888560	Did we hear something else?
8916560	8917560	Something.
8921560	8922560	Maybe it's the bathroom?
8932560	8934560	Alright, I guess we gotta look in the mirror.
8934560	8935560	Right?
8936560	8937560	Senpai?
8940560	8941560	Ooh, spooky!
8946560	8947560	Nope, not there anymore.
8953560	8954560	Spooky?
8955560	8957560	Did your heart race a little bit?
8971560	8973560	It only races for mercy.
8973560	8974560	Oh, you!
8974560	8977560	My Senpais are so kind to me.
8977560	8979560	I knew everyone loved me.
8980560	8982560	Do we go to sleep now?
8984560	8986560	Yeah, we'll go to sleep.
8999560	9003560	Why is Senpai's mom so absent?
9003560	9007560	Mom went out to the city to check out the new house.
9009560	9011560	Welcome to white space.
9012560	9016560	You've been living here as long as you can remember.
9028560	9030560	Meow, waiting for something to happen?
9033560	9036560	Tissue box for wiping your sorrows away.
9038560	9040560	Is something gonna update now?
9042560	9045560	Okay, so now I know at least this is a steak.
9046560	9047560	A steak.
9057560	9059560	Collect keys.
9060560	9062560	What's this?
9066560	9071560	In the grass near a stump on a shrouded old bridge
9071560	9076560	between giant pinwheels near a cast-off cartridge
9076560	9079560	underneath a wet pillow within a large flame
9079560	9083560	beneath a trapped door lost in Pyre's flame
9084560	9088560	lying in a dark cell trapped in a pink cage
9088560	9092560	in a hall of framed faces far below a big stage.
9094560	9097560	Spending time with a frog near a game of roulette
9097560	9099560	amongst the other owls in a water closet
9099560	9102560	in a small moving room at the end of the plank
9102560	9107560	within a live shell in a large bubbly tank
9107560	9111560	surrounded by goo captured in a steel trap
9111560	9114560	the gut of a whale at the end of a map
9114560	9118560	in the field of white snow past the end of the road.
9119560	9120560	Okay.
9126560	9128560	Is that my stomach?
9128560	9130560	Something found nearby.
9137560	9138560	What's this?
9141560	9143560	You found a map.
9146560	9147560	Okay.
9150560	9154560	Press right button to open the headspace map.
9155560	9157560	Like that. Okay.
9158560	9160560	And then we can just open this up.
9160560	9162560	Okay, to collect things.
9167560	9169560	Okay, we have that now.
9171560	9172560	Okay.
9177560	9180560	That was a pretty heavy map, yeah.
9180560	9183560	Hey, Doorcast, if you'd like to do,
9184560	9186560	we should open the door.
9195560	9197560	Yeah, we should open the door.
9201560	9202560	Okay.
9208560	9209560	No.
9210560	9212560	Mari, thank goodness you're here.
9213560	9215560	Have you seen Basil?
9215560	9217560	I can't find him anywhere.
9218560	9221560	We should, we should go tell Mari you're okay.
9222560	9224560	Oh my goodness.
9226560	9227560	Oh my goodness.
9228560	9229560	Ooh.
9229560	9235560	Will Senpai allow me a bit of time to make another tea?
9236560	9239560	Of course you will. You have no choice.
9239560	9243560	Senpais always want me in best health, right?
9243560	9246560	Okay, I'm going to go make some tea so that I,
9246560	9249560	I'm out of liquid right now.
9249560	9251560	Can we get tea too? Of course.
9251560	9254560	I'll tell you what tea I make this time, okay?
9254560	9255560	Thank you.
9257560	9261560	I'll be right back. I'm going to just make a tea.
9287560	9288560	Okay.
9317560	9318560	Okay.
9347560	9348560	Okay.
9377560	9378560	Okay.
9407560	9408560	Okay.
9437560	9438560	Okay.
9467560	9468560	Okay.
9497560	9498560	Okay.
9527560	9528560	Okay.
9557560	9558560	Okay.
9587560	9588560	Okay.
9617560	9618560	Okay.
9647560	9649560	Okay.
9677560	9678560	Okay.
9707560	9709560	Okay.
9737560	9739560	Okay.
9767560	9796560	Senpai, what are you doing?
9797560	9804560	What are you doing? What have you done?
9809560	9810560	Spill it.
9810560	9811560	Spill it.
9811560	9812560	Spill it.
9812560	9814560	Drop what's, whatever's in your mouth.
9814560	9815560	Open.
9816560	9818560	Nothing, nothing.
9818560	9820560	Took you long enough.
9820560	9821560	Hi.
9821560	9822560	Okay.
9822560	9826560	I may have accidentally boiled the water a little too full,
9826560	9828560	so I had to clean that up a little bit.
9834560	9835560	Uh-huh.
9835560	9836560	Uh-huh.
9836560	9838560	You were just cleaning, huh?
9838560	9840560	What were you cleaning?
9840560	9842560	What mess did I leave out?
9842560	9844560	What mess did you leave out?
9845560	9846560	No ping pong.
9846560	9848560	You were playing ping pong?
9851560	9853560	Without me?
9854560	9855560	Senpai.
9857560	9859560	Senpai, how could you?
9859560	9860560	Anyways, today's...
9865560	9870560	Anyways, to, right now, the tea that I decided to go with is echinacea.
9871560	9873560	Echinacea tea.
9874560	9876560	Same one that I always do.
9880560	9884560	You brought a pool table to everybody into the cage.
9884560	9885560	Back again.
9887560	9888560	Everyone.
9888560	9894560	Where the universal, universal shock collar that we all got from Shibi.
9896560	9900560	And we're putting the shock collar to 10.
9906560	9907560	Bzzzzz.
9914560	9936840	Now, everybody's shocked.
9936840	9938680	Since when were there shock callers in Wonderland?
9938680	9939680	Since forever.
9939680	9942320	I mean, like, that place is full of toys everywhere.
9942320	9943320	Come on.
9944200	9946600	Hey, yeah, I get some of my stuff with them.
9946600	9948040	You bring tea for the rest of us?
9948040	9950640	You didn't ask me to bring you back tea, Senpai.
9950640	9952760	You want me to make you a cup all over again?
9958120	9959840	I'm still waiting for this one to cool.
9962280	9963280	We did ask, though.
9963280	9964280	Oh, did you?
9964280	9965640	I must have not heard.
9973400	9974920	I must have not heard.
9974920	9977120	I'll make everyone a little cup later.
9994000	9995480	Is Echinacea OK?
10004320	10005320	Anything.
10005320	10006320	OK.
10006320	10008320	I'll boil up a teapot.
10008320	10010320	I'll bring out the finest teapot.
10012320	10016320	I'll bring out the finest teapot and the finest china there is.
10017320	10019320	There'll be, like, little cats on them or something.
10022320	10024320	Actually, I do have a cat one.
10024320	10026320	Yeah, I have a really cute cat one.
10034320	10035320	We want to hear our cup.
10035320	10037320	There are six.
10037320	10038320	Fight for them.
10051320	10052320	Fight for them.
10056320	10058320	Mercy lemonade.
10058320	10059320	You've been bad.
10059320	10061320	Why would I give you that?
10062320	10065320	I also don't have lemons with me, so you have to wait a few days.
10066320	10070320	You have to wait a few days, and I'll come back with the lemonade.
10070320	10073320	And then, yeah, it'll be fine.
10083320	10087320	Well, let's continue, since you've all been so bad.
10088320	10090320	Are lemons even in season?
10090320	10091320	Good question.
10095320	10099320	Maybe I'll get, like, those lemon zest, and then we'll sprinkle it.
10099320	10101320	We'll put some a little bit into water.
10118320	10125320	And then maybe, maybe we'll dilute it, and then no one will notice.
10128320	10130320	No one will notice at that point.
10130320	10132320	You should go tell Mara you're okay.
10132320	10133320	She's worried sick.
10133320	10136320	Oh, am I stuck out of the window?
10136320	10137320	There we go.
10137320	10140320	I'm still going to let the tea cool a bit, though.
10140320	10142320	But thank you, senpai.
10146320	10147320	Stretch.
10152320	10156320	Okay, we should go tell Mara you're okay.
10156320	10158320	Just give me a second.
10158320	10159320	Okay.
10159320	10160320	Okay.
10160320	10161320	Okay.
10161320	10164320	We should go tell Mara you're okay.
10164320	10166320	Just give me a second.
10167320	10169320	We should tell Mara you're okay.
10169320	10170320	She's been worried sick.
10173320	10175320	I don't know, glies.
10175320	10176320	Let's get this toaster.
10178320	10179320	Toast.
10185320	10187320	It's going out all night.
10187320	10189320	Here's your allowance for today.
10189320	10190320	I got 200 clams.
10190320	10192320	I got 200 clams!
10202320	10204320	They said there was one.
10204320	10205320	Hold on.
10206320	10208320	In the grass near a stump.
10213320	10214320	Oh, there it is.
10215320	10216320	Oh.
10217320	10218320	Hey.
10225320	10226320	11 keys left.
10245320	10247320	I'll build a sand castle again.
10251320	10252320	Okay, let's see.
10252320	10255320	Next one on a shrouded old bridge.
10257320	10259320	I'm not sure if this is the bridge.
10264320	10266320	And there's like a bunch of A's at the end.
10269320	10270320	Hmm.
10274320	10275320	Hmm.
10285320	10286320	I'm lying.
10286320	10287320	You're okay.
10291320	10292320	Don't worry.
10292320	10294320	Don't worry me like that.
10296320	10297320	Where's Basil?
10304320	10306320	He's not with you, Maury?
10307320	10308320	No.
10308320	10310320	I'm afraid not.
10310320	10314320	The last thing I remember was sorting photos with Basil in his house.
10314320	10315320	Next thing I know.
10315320	10319320	I'm waking up in neighbor's room with Aubrey and Cal.
10335320	10336320	Ah.
10341320	10343320	At least we found you, Maury.
10343320	10345320	I hope Basil's okay.
10345320	10347320	He's gonna protect him if we're not there.
10348320	10350320	We'll be such a downer, Aubrey.
10350320	10352320	We'll find Basil for sure.
10352320	10354320	Absolutely right, Cal.
10354320	10357320	It's times like this we got to stay positive.
10359320	10361320	I only go back to Basil's house.
10361320	10363320	Might be something we missed.
10363320	10365320	That's the spirit hero.
10365320	10368320	He's always up here if you need me.
10372320	10373320	Merci.
10373320	10377320	May I ask what the guidelines are on Villalor fan video games?
10377320	10380320	I don't see anything about on the Villalor website.
10380320	10381320	Hmm.
10382320	10385320	Is it not on the terms of service?
10385320	10388320	Not terms of service, the fan work guidelines?
10389320	10390320	Oops.
10390320	10391320	Hold on.
10391320	10394320	Let me put this down a little bit.
10398320	10399320	I'm a controller.
10400320	10404320	Right now my lips are a little dry,
10404320	10406320	so I'm gonna have to put lip balm on.
10418320	10422320	But I don't think there's anything against it,
10422320	10426320	but you'll probably have to ask Stronny for management for that.
10426320	10429320	Or I'll send in an email through the website.
10429320	10431320	I'm not like a reliable source.
10439320	10440320	How's the tea, Mercy?
10440320	10442320	I can't taste it because...
10448320	10450320	because it's too hot.
10450320	10451320	Still.
10470320	10474320	I'm sure we're more than happy to get a fan game.
10479320	10485320	But I'm pretty sure it's under, like, fan work?
10485320	10488320	Fan work derivatives or something?
10488320	10490320	Just double check it.
10490320	10492320	Just double check it.
10492320	10497320	All fan arts, of course, need to comply with the...
10497320	10498320	with the...
10498320	10499320	Oops.
10499320	10500320	Ooh.
10500320	10502320	I'm knocking things over.
10503320	10505320	With the terms of services?
10508320	10509320	Yeah.
10525320	10527320	Sorry, just put on a lip balm.
10529320	10531320	Ah, my lips get so dry.
10531320	10533320	It's been so cold lately.
10539320	10540320	Yeah, that's good tea.
10543320	10544320	Okay.
10546320	10547320	Let's continue.
10552320	10554320	I struggle with dry lips myself.
10554320	10555320	Uh, never seems to help.
10555320	10556320	Okay.
10557320	10559320	Um, I have this trouble, too.
10559320	10562320	So the only thing that works for me are two...
10562320	10563320	are three things.
10565320	10566320	Um...
10569320	10571320	Vaseline.
10574320	10577320	Um, the specific lip gloss.
10582320	10583320	And...
10583320	10586320	Okay, this is gonna sound really weird.
10587320	10592320	But this is a suggestion a lot of celebrities do.
10593320	10595320	Which is nipple cream.
10596320	10598320	Uh, nipple balm.
10598320	10599320	Sorry, not nipple cream.
10599320	10600320	Nipple balm.
10602320	10604320	Because, uh, it's for...
10604320	10606320	for, um...
10606320	10608320	for mothers.
10608320	10610320	When a child is feeding...
10612320	10614320	feeding, um, the balm...
10614320	10619320	the nipple can get really chapped and dry.
10619320	10621320	And because the...
10621320	10623320	the, um...
10626320	10630320	the texture on the nipple is similar to lips.
10630320	10631320	I guess.
10631320	10635320	Um, a lot of celebrities use a...
10635320	10637320	nipple balm...
10637320	10639320	for their lips instead.
10643320	10644320	Yeah, it hurts.
10644320	10645320	It hurts.
10645320	10647320	So, like, a lot of mothers will buy these nipple balms,
10647320	10648320	and then they'll...
10648320	10650320	they'll, uh, it helps with the...
10650320	10652320	the peeling and the dryness and the pain
10652320	10654320	and the sores from...
10654320	10656320	from when a baby, uh...
10656320	10658320	baby, uh, suckles.
10668320	10669320	Yeah.
10669320	10673320	Actually, you can literally probably go to any store
10673320	10675320	and then they'll have it.
10675320	10676320	They'll probably have it.
10676320	10678320	Uh, I bought some.
10678320	10679320	I bought some not too long ago
10679320	10681320	because I had, like, really dry lips.
10681320	10684320	Um, a lot of people say, uh,
10684320	10686320	it lasts quite a long time.
10686320	10688320	You only need a little bit.
10688320	10692320	And I find that it doesn't dr...
10692320	10698320	it doesn't go away as fast as the, um...
10698320	10700320	as regular lip balm.
10700320	10702320	It doesn't work for me, though,
10702320	10704320	because I kind of have sensitive skin,
10704320	10707320	so if it gets anywhere around the lip area,
10707320	10709320	that's not on my lips.
10709320	10711320	And it tends to, like, uh, that area
10711320	10713320	tends to be, like, a little sensitive.
10717320	10720320	So, um, let me...
10720320	10721320	Okay, I know it's weird,
10721320	10722320	but let me find...
10722320	10724320	find, uh, it.
10724320	10725320	I know it's weird.
10725320	10726320	It's weird.
10726320	10728320	It's weird, but I want to help.
10728320	10740320	So, this is the one...
10740320	10744320	I have.
10744320	10746320	Let me try to find it.
10746320	10750320	Here.
10750320	10752320	Um...
10752320	10756320	I'll show you.
10756320	10758320	I'll show you.
10758320	10760320	It does say cream on it,
10760320	10762320	but it's more like a balm.
10762320	10763320	It's more like a balm.
10763320	10765320	It comes out like a Vaseline balm.
10765320	10773320	It-a-ba-ba-ba-ba-neep balm cream.
10773320	10774320	My skin's kind of sensitive,
10774320	10776320	so it doesn't really work
10776320	10778320	for the skin around it,
10778320	10780320	but this is what I...
10780320	10781320	I don't know.
10781320	10783320	I don't know.
10783320	10785320	It doesn't work the skin around it,
10785320	10788320	but this is what I-I found to work.
10788320	10792320	This-this one.
10792320	10793320	Does it smell?
10793320	10795320	I don't think it has a particular smell to it,
10795320	10797320	especially because it's, uh,
10797320	10799320	safe for babies to ingest as well,
10799320	10801320	so I think it doesn't have
10801320	10803320	any particular smell to it.
10804320	10813320	So a lot of celebrities
10813320	10815320	will use this instead of
10815320	10816320	a regular lip balm
10816320	10821320	because it's stronger.
10821320	10824320	I think it comes in a-a different format now.
10824320	10826320	I think it comes in a little jar.
10826320	10828320	Jar, but when I bought it,
10828320	10832320	it-it's-it's this-it's this little tube.
10833320	10835320	But yeah, this is, like,
10835320	10837320	if you have trouble finding lip balm,
10837320	10839320	so, like, if regular lip balm doesn't work for you
10839320	10841320	and, like, Vaseline doesn't work for you
10841320	10843320	or anything, try this one.
10850320	10851320	Try this.
10851320	10854320	Like, legitimately, it-it-it will help with, uh,
10854320	10855320	try it out.
10855320	10857320	It's not too expensive either, I think.
10857320	10860320	Uh, and it lasts forever.
10860320	10862320	It lasts forever.
10870320	10872320	How much per box?
10872320	10874320	I bought it for around ten-
10874320	10876320	I bought it for ten dollars,
10876320	10880320	and it's a huge little tube, you know?
10880320	10884320	It's about-it was about the size of my hand,
10884320	10886320	but then again, my hands are-are a bit-
10886320	10890320	or maybe different size.
10895320	10896320	I'm not sure.
10896320	10898320	I think it might be cheaper at certain places,
10898320	10901320	but it's definitely something that-that people can use
10901320	10903320	for their lips.
10906320	10908320	For their lips instead of, um,
10908320	10910320	instead of regular lip balm.
10910320	10912320	Especially if it, uh...
10913320	10916320	If it, if it, if it...
10918320	10920320	Because, uh, let's be real,
10920320	10923320	lip balm industry kind of sucks.
10923320	10925320	They literally dry out your lips even more
10925320	10927320	and so that you have to reapply it all the time.
10927320	10929320	Kind of sucks that way.
10936320	10940320	So, yeah, celebrities will use, uh, this little-
10940320	10943320	for this-for lip balm instead.
10943320	10946320	And since it's, uh, safe for babies to ingest,
10946320	10948320	it should be safe on your lips
10948320	10950320	and for you to ingest as well.
10955320	10957320	So, um...
10957320	10960320	Yeah, the brand I use normally
10960320	10963320	that doesn't make my skin super sensitive,
10963320	10965320	is if you have super sensitive skin,
10965320	10969320	uh, the nipple-nipple cream might not work for you,
10969320	10971320	so I just use Vaseline.
10971320	10973320	I just use Vaseline.
10973320	10975320	It works.
10983320	10987320	Does-but does nipple balm come in a nice little container
10987320	10989320	that fits also nicely in my pocket?
10989320	10994320	Um, my advice for that is take a lip balm tin,
10994320	10997320	like an empty lip balm tin,
10997320	10999320	and just squeeze some in.
11010320	11012320	Vaseline's the only thing that works for me.
11012320	11015320	It's really s-it's-it's petroleum, so...
11018320	11022320	Um, but, uh, I find the nipple-the nipple balm,
11022320	11024320	like, it's-it's about the size of my hand.
11024320	11026320	It actually fits in, like, purse and stuff really well.
11026320	11029320	And if-well, if you're-you're a guy,
11029320	11031320	you have pockets everywhere, it's gonna fit.
11031320	11033320	Your pockets can fit in ten-Nintendo switches,
11033320	11035320	so it's fine.
11044320	11047320	But, like, if you have sensitive skin,
11047320	11049320	um, try it out first.
11049320	11051320	Like, try-it might work out for you.
11051320	11053320	It didn't work for me,
11054320	11057320	but I do use it in emergencies.
11057320	11061320	Like, if my skin-my lip-the skin on my lip
11061320	11063320	is so chapped it's, like, cutting,
11063320	11065320	I will use the nipple balm.
11084320	11088320	Cause, um, yeah, I suffer from-from dry skin,
11088320	11091320	sensitive skin, mostly dry skin.
11091320	11095320	My skin is super dry, so I need to moisturize a lot.
11099320	11102320	Wait, Mercy, you can have a lip balm ASMR trigger.
11102320	11104320	What does that mean?
11104320	11106320	How do you do that?
11107320	11108320	Thanks, Mercy.
11108320	11110320	This has been extremely educational.
11110320	11113320	Finally, some-maybe, finally,
11113320	11116320	can get some soft lip-sci-cave.
11116320	11117320	Yeah.
11117320	11119320	Just dry skin or eczema.
11119320	11121320	I don't have eczema, but I do have dry skin.
11121320	11124320	Pretty dry skin, so my skin will get pretty flaky and stuff.
11129320	11131320	That being-that was, like, what?
11131320	11133320	Like, popping the lips like this?
11133320	11134320	Like, like that?
11134320	11136320	Is-is that a trigger?
11140320	11141320	Really?
11141320	11142320	What?
11142320	11143320	It is?
11143320	11144320	Oh, okay.
11148320	11150320	Thanks for teaching me some pie.
11156320	11158320	But yeah, I suffer from dry lips,
11158320	11160320	so every once in a while during streams,
11160320	11162320	I'll be like, uggh, if you see me go like,
11162320	11163320	uggh, I'm gonna go like,
11163320	11164320	uggh, I'm gonna go like,
11164320	11165320	uggh, I'm gonna go like,
11165320	11166320	uggh, I'm gonna go like,
11166320	11167320	uggh, I'm gonna go like,
11167320	11168320	uggh, I'm gonna go like,
11168320	11169320	uggh, I'm gonna go like,
11169320	11171320	uggh, if you see me go like, uggh,
11171320	11173320	I'm putting on the bomb.
11174320	11177320	Yeah, mercy my twin with the skin issues.
11182320	11185320	But yeah, if-if-if everyone,
11185320	11187320	if, like, Senpai suffer from dry lips,
11187320	11189320	I have, like, tips-
11189320	11191320	I have tips, so I have, like,
11191320	11193320	I definitely use that one.
11193320	11196320	Vaseline is my only go-to recently.
11196320	11198320	Um...
11198320	11199320	And then, for Vaseline,
11199320	11201320	I just put it in, like, a little tin.
11211320	11212320	You can also probably do the same thing.
11212320	11214320	Wanted. What's the Wanted poster?
11216320	11219320	Pluto, the ninth planet in the solar system.
11219320	11221320	No reward, sorry.
11222320	11225320	Huh?
11225320	11226320	Faceless Missy.
11226320	11227320	Huh? Faceless Missy again?
11227320	11229320	It wasn't me this time, I promise.
11229320	11231320	I'll leave me alone to repent.
11235320	11237320	I'm gonna swing in the moon!
11239320	11241320	Eh? There's a mirror here.
11244320	11246320	A floating mirror.
11246320	11248320	Your friends smile warmly behind you.
11249320	11251320	That-that's cute.
11253320	11254320	I think it flowers someone,
11254320	11255320	but he's only interested in puzzles.
11255320	11256320	If only I had a-
11256320	11258320	I could find a flower puzzle or something.
11258320	11260320	He would notice me.
11261320	11264320	I wonder if there's a flower puzzle or something.
11278320	11280320	How about you?
11284320	11286320	Huh?
11291320	11293320	Oh, I'm glad I could help my supplies.
11293320	11294320	I know it's a weird-
11294320	11296320	I know it's weird, especially if it's like-
11296320	11298320	Hey, so, it's got to be around here somewhere.
11298320	11300320	Especially since it's like,
11300320	11301320	Oh, Violaur, the, uh, the,
11301320	11303320	Hoo-hoo, company.
11303320	11305320	Kind of sus company.
11308320	11310320	Oh no, a flower!
11310320	11312320	It's flowers! They're already dying!
11312320	11314320	Do your best to take care of them until Basel gets back.
11316320	11318320	Would you like to water the plants?
11318320	11320320	Yeah, of course!
11326320	11328320	Oh!
11328320	11330320	How do I...
11338320	11340320	How do I water them?
11342320	11344320	Wait, how do I water them?
11344320	11346320	Is water the voted ones?
11346320	11348320	Okay.
11348320	11350320	Well, these are lilies of the valley, so they probably just look like that, huh?
11354320	11356320	Okay, well...
11360320	11362320	Cacti probably won't die.
11370320	11372320	Cacti probably won't die.
11374320	11376320	Tulips are fine.
11384320	11386320	Ma, are you here?
11386320	11388320	Get some delicious fruits?
11404320	11406320	Cacti probably won't die.
11412320	11414320	Wipe your feet, everyone!
11414320	11416320	Ugh, fuck are you!
11424320	11426320	Oh, there doesn't seem anything out of the ordinary.
11428320	11430320	You think Basel just left somewhere without telling us?
11430320	11432320	I don't know, that doesn't sound like him.
11434320	11436320	He's usually so considerate about these things.
11438320	11440320	Guys, I'm really worried. There's nothing we can do?
11440320	11442320	We can't find him!
11442320	11444320	What if he's in danger?
11444320	11446320	They come, Aubrey.
11446320	11448320	I'm worried too, but that won't solve anything.
11448320	11450320	He won't slug around the forest.
11450320	11452320	Maybe he wandered off and got lost.
11452320	11454320	Yeah, cheer up, Aubrey!
11454320	11456320	We'll find Basel.
11458320	11460320	You guys are right.
11460320	11462320	Okay, we gotta keep our hopes up.
11462320	11464320	Let's look for Basel in the Vast for it.
11466320	11468320	What is that?
11470320	11472320	Fireplace is burning.
11472320	11474320	It just says Basel left it.
11474320	11476320	Look, case.
11476320	11478320	It's a little dusty.
11478320	11480320	Ah, ah, ah!
11480320	11482320	Achoo!
11488320	11490320	I guess we gotta kill these dust bunnies.
11492320	11494320	Let's go!
11498320	11500320	Never mind, we're fine!
11510320	11512320	Comfortable looking bed.
11514320	11516320	Small plants, they look a little sad.
11516320	11518320	Okay, well, I guess we gotta go find.
11520320	11522320	Go find Basel.
11528320	11530320	I know we killed the dust bunny,
11530320	11532320	but I'm like, ah, ah, ah!
11532320	11534320	Well...
11534320	11536320	Yes!
11538320	11540320	Stomped out of existence.
11540320	11542320	Personally, I don't like dust bunnies either.
11542320	11544320	I guess we'll find Basel.
11544320	11546320	Personally, I don't like dust bunnies either.
11546320	11548320	They make me sneeze.
11548320	11550320	I don't like sneezing.
11564320	11566320	We're going this way.
11570320	11572320	Fast forest.
11574320	11576320	We're going this way.
11592320	11594320	There's a parrot, I think.
11598320	11600320	Basel!
11600320	11602320	Basel, where are you?
11604320	11606320	I know.
11606320	11608320	I bet my pet rock will know what to do.
11608320	11610320	Heck, there'll be a good boy.
11610320	11612320	Go find Basel.
11622320	11624320	Try your best, buddy.
11626320	11628320	This is no time to fool around, Cal.
11628320	11630320	Hey, why you?
11630320	11632320	Pector was just trying to help.
11632320	11634320	I call you two.
11634320	11636320	We need to keep ourselves focused.
11642320	11644320	Squawk!
11644320	11646320	Main station.
11646320	11648320	Squawk! Squawk!
11648320	11650320	Body bridge.
11658320	11660320	Your voice is really nice to listen to.
11660320	11664320	You say that as I literally squawk.
11682320	11684320	Kill the bunny.
11684320	11686320	Oh no, it winked.
11688320	11690320	Oh no, it winked.
11718320	11720320	We won!
11738320	11740320	Yay, we won!
11740320	11742320	We won!
11746320	11748320	We got stuff.
11750320	11752320	There's those.
11752320	11754320	Got both of them.
11756320	11758320	Ah, give me a second.
11762320	11764320	Got bracelet.
11764320	11766320	Okay.
11766320	11768320	And now I can fight this bunny in.
11768320	11770320	Go!
11770320	11772320	Fight bunny!
11772320	11774320	Die!
11776320	11778320	No, not the bunny link.
11778320	11780320	I can do that too.
11780320	11782320	Hold on.
11782320	11784320	Pempie, are you ready?
11798320	11800320	Okay.
11818320	11820320	Got life cam.
11822320	11826320	Let's quickly grab stuff.
11826320	11828320	Let's get a bottle of juice.
11836320	11838320	Oh.
11846320	11848320	That over here, right?
11856320	11858320	Hmm. I don't know, guys.
11858320	11860320	I think Basel's in this forest.
11860320	11862320	We haven't searched the whole forest yet.
11862320	11864320	Can't stop now.
11864320	11866320	Cheer up, Aubrey.
11866320	11868320	We'll keep searching until we find them.
11868320	11870320	We don't find Basel soon.
11870320	11872320	Maybe we should meet up with Mari and the playground
11872320	11874320	and figure out what to do from there.
11874320	11876320	Bridge, right?
11880320	11882320	There it is.
11882320	11884320	Bee.
11886320	11888320	10 keys left.
11892320	11894320	Between giant pinwheels.
11902320	11904320	Hold on.
11916320	11918320	I don't know what to do.
11918320	11920320	Oh, we're here.
11920320	11922320	It's a good idea.
11922320	11924320	We'll be back.
11924320	11926320	It's a good idea.
11926320	11928320	Let's go.
11928320	11930320	We're here!
11930320	11932320	Come on.
11932320	11934320	Let's go.
11934320	11936320	Let's go.
11936320	11938320	Come on.
11938320	11940320	Come on.
11940320	11942320	Come on.
11942320	11944320	Come on.
11944320	11946320	Come on.
11946320	11948320	Come on.
11948320	11950320	Come on.
11950320	11952320	Come on.
11954320	11956320	Come on.
11956320	11958320	Come on.
11970320	11972320	Come on.
11972320	11974320	Come on.
11974320	12002920	I might go back because I'm just like oh
12002920	12010040	I just have Michael back because I didn't
12010040	12015280	explore that entire areola yet and I'm
12015280	12017960	kind of a type of player who wants to
12017960	12019560	complete everything
12020180	12023520	gosh
12039040	12045440	I gotta revive us again
12049560	12053560	Why is this bunny so fricking strong?!
12072560	12074560	No! Not another toast!
12079560	12081560	Okay, good, we stabbed it.
12088560	12090560	Well, that's a problem.
12109560	12111560	Whee! Whee! Whee!
12115560	12117560	I gotta run, bye.
12126560	12128560	Whoa!
12129560	12131560	No, don't touch me!
12132560	12134560	Don't, don't, don't!
12135560	12138560	Don't touch me, not yet!
12139560	12141560	Don't touch me, not yet!
12147560	12149560	What the?
12153560	12156560	Hello everyone, how's it going? Have you found Basel yet?
12157560	12159560	Hey Mari, not look so far I'm afraid.
12160560	12164560	Oh, I'm sorry guys. Sarah was the way I could help more.
12165560	12169560	We're all doing our best, maybe we should start looking outside this forest.
12171560	12174560	I know, why don't we try climbing a really long ladder?
12175560	12177560	East, one east of the stump.
12178560	12180560	Dude, that'll Mari's afraid of heights.
12181560	12184560	What if Basel somewhere up there? We gotta take her chances.
12185560	12187560	I know, but...
12189560	12191560	Oh boy, growing stronger and stronger every day.
12191560	12194560	You kind of keep climbing a ladder, can't you?
12195560	12197560	Come on little brother, face your fears.
12198560	12201560	It's natural to be nervous at first, but you should know that, we all believe in you.
12202560	12205560	Come on now Mari, just one measly little ladder.
12206560	12208560	No worries that can happen.
12209560	12210560	I'm not about this.
12211560	12212560	Are you here to be okay? Oh Mari?
12213560	12214560	No.
12215560	12216560	Okay, just take your time.
12217560	12219560	Come on now Mari, you can't just sit tight with Basel missing.
12219560	12220560	Mari, we have to do this.
12221560	12222560	I'm here to support you.
12223560	12225560	If anything happens, we'll be all here to protect you too.
12226560	12227560	Won't we all agree?
12228560	12230560	No, I guess you're right about that.
12231560	12233560	Have nothing to be afraid of as long as we're together.
12234560	12236560	Basel's probably all alone. He needs us right now.
12238560	12240560	Mari, you need to face your fears for Basel's sake.
12241560	12242560	I believe in you.
12243560	12245560	Take it slow if you like, as long as we get there eventually.
12246560	12247560	Woohoo!
12247560	12249560	Let's go, let's go to the ladder east of the stump.
12251560	12252560	I'll see you later Mari.
12253560	12254560	I know.
12255560	12256560	Stay safe.
12256560	12258560	Remember oh Mari, you're stronger than you think.
12260560	12261560	Give me a second.
12262560	12263560	Yeah, nutritious candy.
12269560	12271560	I'll probably save as well.
12272560	12273560	I yapped so much.
12275560	12276560	I yapped so much.
12277560	12278560	Hahaha.
12284560	12286560	Grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.
12287560	12289560	Hey man, something wrong with Burley?
12290560	12291560	Seems a little upset.
12294560	12295560	Oh, about that well you see.
12299560	12300560	Let me explain.
12301560	12302560	Look at this pole.
12303560	12304560	Can't you believe it?
12305560	12306560	There's no tether ball?
12308560	12309560	What are we looking at?
12310560	12311560	Yeah, I don't see it.
12314560	12315560	Exactly!
12316560	12317560	The tether ball is missing.
12318560	12320560	And you used his arm and swung it too hard.
12321560	12322560	Now the ball has gone off somewhere.
12324560	12325560	Never to be seen again.
12326560	12328560	I thought you didn't have to use your arms man.
12329560	12330560	I'm gonna use your head.
12331560	12332560	Like this.
12333560	12334560	Sorry Burley.
12335560	12336560	Using my head.
12337560	12338560	All the time gives me a headache.
12339560	12341560	That's because you don't have a hard head like I do.
12343560	12344560	Oh, something just hit me.
12345560	12347560	I'm sure I saw the ball flying off somewhere in that direction.
12350560	12353560	Into the vast, into the vast forest?
12354560	12355560	Never find it now.
12356560	12357560	Things will be lost forever.
12358560	12359560	I don't smell it Burley.
12360560	12361560	We'll find it's ball for you.
12362560	12363560	Yeah, be sure you want to do that.
12364560	12365560	Fast forward to pretty good use place you know.
12366560	12372560	One time, game gun just super gizzy brawl with this ugly pint creature with dead empty eyes and a gaping mouth.
12373560	12374560	I outroided it.
12375560	12376560	Of course, being cool and smart and all.
12377560	12379560	There's no monster in all the universe that can't outrun me.
12382560	12383560	What?
12387560	12388560	Hey Elmore, why don't you try?
12389560	12391560	You and your friends go with Burley and keep her out of trouble.
12392560	12393560	I'll go myself, but...
12395560	12396560	Man!
12397560	12399560	Be all right, I'll be my beings again.
12401560	12402560	Oh geez, there's my cue.
12403560	12404560	I'm coming happy.
12405560	12406560	You safe out there guys.
12407560	12408560	See you when you get back.
12410560	12411560	Come on Burley.
12412560	12413560	Come on Burley, let's go find your lost ball.
12414560	12416560	You don't have anything to worry about as long as we're together.
12417560	12418560	I can't share.
12419560	12421560	Just don't get in my way when I show off my totally amazing headbutt skills.
12423560	12424560	Let's just get this over with.
12426560	12427560	Burley joined your party.
12434560	12437560	I guess I'm a little bad because where would my shop please buy something like this?
12439560	12440560	I'm gonna get some candy.
12442560	12443560	Maybe six candies.
12445560	12446560	So I can...
12447560	12448560	Heal up.
12451560	12452560	What the heck happened over here?
12456560	12459560	Rows ran over me and knocked me down, but I'm just lying here because it feels good.
12467560	12468560	Oh no, thanks.
12469560	12470560	Thanks, you're gonna be okay.
12475560	12476560	Is this anywhere in my last moment?
12477560	12478560	Is this somewhere else to be or something?
12478560	12479560	No.
12480560	12482560	Okay, I will go get your lost ball.
12484560	12486560	Oh, don't forget to use Hero's Healing Skill.
12486560	12487560	Oh yeah, I forgot.
12488560	12489560	I forgot.
12494560	12495560	It's not this way, is it?
12497560	12498560	Squawk!
12498560	12499560	In the Meal Forest.
12499560	12500560	Squawk, Squawk!
12500560	12501560	Longy Bridge.
12501560	12502560	Longy Bridge.
12512560	12513560	Where's this?
12525560	12526560	Okay.
12526560	12527560	Okay.
12530560	12531560	I guess not.
12533560	12534560	I'll come here soon.
12534560	12535560	Oops, I ran into a bunny.
12556560	12557560	Okay.
12584560	12585560	Hi, guys.
12586560	12587560	It's a bunny.
12600560	12601560	Bye bye, bunny.
12616560	12617560	There we go.
12618560	12619560	Okay, we got it.
12647560	12648560	Where's my...
12649560	12650560	Kit?
12651560	12652560	Snacks? Tofu?
12654560	12656560	Here, I'll put Candy on.
12657560	12658560	Girl?
12658560	12659560	There you go.
12660560	12661560	All better.
12667560	12668560	What's over here?
12669560	12670560	Huh?
12672560	12673560	It's the tire swing.
12679560	12681560	Alright, we'll kill him again.
12698560	12701560	Quickly kill the sprout thing.
12729560	12730560	Huh?
12747560	12748560	Eh.
12748560	12749560	Hmm?
12758560	12760560	Some pies need another wink?
12766560	12767560	I patch on, wink.
12779560	12780560	Sorry.
12780560	12782560	Bunny, can you wait?
12798560	12799560	There we go.
12808560	12813560	I can't remember what the weaknesses were.
12832560	12835560	Like, angry over sad, okay.
12838560	12839560	Be stronger than sad.
12840560	12841560	Sad, stronger than him.
12842560	12843560	Okay.
12845560	12848560	Eh, we'll make this dish sad.
12851560	12852560	Hopefully.
12868560	12869560	Okay.
12889560	12891560	I think Omlauri has stronger...
12892560	12893560	...stronger attack.
12898560	12899560	Okay.
12916560	12917560	There we go.
12923560	12924560	There we go.
12924560	12926560	We just managed to offball.
12926560	12927560	Oh.
12928560	12929560	There we go.
12938560	12939560	There we go.
12942560	12944560	I'm starting to get the hang of it.
12944560	12945560	Yepa.
12949560	12951560	Oh, I'm probably gonna heal again.
12955560	12956560	I hate eggs.
12956560	12957560	I hate stepping on eggs.
12957560	12960560	I think the possibility of even stepping on eggs is disgusting.
12981560	12983560	Okay, where's that tether ball?
12984560	12985560	Yeah, Jax.
12992560	12993560	Not over here.
12996560	12998560	I say totally avoiding...
13000560	13001560	...rain station.
13014560	13016560	Hi, I'm the wise rock.
13016560	13017560	I'll give you solid advice.
13017560	13018560	It can exchange for clams.
13018560	13019560	Kind of vice.
13020560	13023560	Would you like me to give good advice?
13024560	13025560	Okay, advice.
13025560	13026560	Bad advice.
13026560	13027560	Okay.
13027560	13029560	And everyone wants...
13029560	13030560	...wants an okay...
13030560	13031560	...good advice, right?
13034560	13036560	How bad is your egg allergy?
13036560	13038560	Like, have a pen handy?
13039560	13041560	You guys wanna give a bad advice?
13041560	13042560	Okay.
13045560	13046560	Let's see.
13046560	13047560	I have...
13047560	13049560	My allergy is pretty bad.
13049560	13050560	Like, if I touch it...
13051560	13053560	...my throat constricts and stuff,
13053560	13055560	I don't need an FD pen.
13056560	13059560	I usually, if I have the first sign...
13060560	13061560	...of the allergy coming,
13061560	13063560	I will use Benadryl.
13064560	13066560	But if I eat too much...
13066560	13068560	...or ingest eggs too much,
13068560	13070560	I will need to be hospitalized.
13071560	13074560	So, yeah, that's...
13074560	13076560	I'm pretty allergic.
13076560	13077560	What is...
13077560	13078560	What is my...
13078560	13080560	If you look up a certain thing,
13080560	13082560	let me see what it's called again.
13083560	13084560	Let me see something.
13084560	13085560	What it's called again.
13085560	13086560	Yeah.
13131560	13132560	Ah, okay.
13133560	13134560	My allergy...
13135560	13136560	What happens?
13137560	13138560	Is called...
13139560	13140560	Angio...
13141560	13143560	Angioedema.
13145560	13146560	But it's...
13146560	13147560	It's worse for me,
13147560	13149560	because my throat actually swells as well.
13150560	13151560	So then I can't breathe.
13152560	13153560	So...
13153560	13154560	I have...
13154560	13155560	I have...
13155560	13156560	I have...
13156560	13157560	I have...
13157560	13158560	I have...
13158560	13159560	I have...
13159560	13160560	I have...
13160560	13162560	So I get swollen eyes.
13163560	13164560	Swollen lips.
13165560	13166560	Swollen tongue.
13166560	13168560	And my throat gets swollen as well.
13170560	13171560	So then I can't breathe.
13171560	13173560	Then I have to go to the hospital.
13176560	13177560	So...
13177560	13178560	If...
13178560	13180560	To have a visual...
13181560	13182560	Um...
13183560	13185560	Visual of what I will look like.
13185560	13186560	Just think of how...
13186560	13187560	How Pepe...
13187560	13189560	Pepe the frog looks.
13189560	13191560	I will look exactly like that.
13206560	13207560	But, um...
13207560	13209560	Sorry, I keep on falling asleep.
13209560	13211560	My motto keeps on falling asleep.
13216560	13218560	Uh, eggs are everywhere in most foods, basically.
13218560	13220560	Does this mean you have a...
13220560	13221560	A specified diet?
13221560	13222560	Uh...
13222560	13224560	I eat mostly vegan.
13224560	13226560	Mostly vegan.
13227560	13228560	Um...
13229560	13230560	Unfortunately.
13231560	13233560	It's like vegan, but not by choice.
13235560	13237560	Do you like the taste of eggs?
13237560	13240560	I've never even tasted eggs in my entire life.
13249560	13251560	Can't eat mayo either?
13251560	13253560	No, I can't have mayo.
13253560	13255560	Oh, but recently, um...
13255560	13256560	How...
13256560	13257560	How...
13257560	13258560	How many...
13258560	13261560	How many have made a vegan mayo?
13261560	13263560	Which, apparently, according to my...
13263560	13265560	My gal pals...
13265560	13266560	It tastes...
13266560	13268560	It tastes exactly like mayo.
13268560	13271560	So I've been using that recently for my sandwiches.
13272560	13273560	Hahahaha!
13276560	13277560	I, um...
13277560	13281560	Only, I feel like, within like the past few years...
13281560	13284560	Was like when things started, uh...
13284560	13287560	People have started to accept like vegan as like...
13287560	13288560	As like a...
13288560	13290560	It started to be more of a trendy diet.
13290560	13291560	Uh...
13292560	13294560	Like, I tried...
13295560	13297560	A cake for the first time.
13297560	13299560	Like a moist cake.
13299560	13301560	For the first time in adulthood.
13304560	13305560	Hahahaha!
13309560	13311560	Now, which has got any...
13311560	13313560	Favorite kind of bread?
13317560	13321560	I don't know, I think bread is usually pretty safe.
13321560	13322560	Hahahaha!
13330560	13332560	But, uh, I tested it.
13332560	13334560	Uh, I think it's only bird eggs.
13334560	13336560	I've never tried lizard eggs.
13336560	13338560	And I'm a little too scared to try, but...
13338560	13339560	Um...
13339560	13341560	Mama!
13341560	13343560	In my youth.
13343560	13346560	I've been allergic to eggs since I was born.
13346560	13348560	So, um...
13349560	13350560	So...
13353560	13357560	Mama! Mama tried to give me a quail egg.
13357560	13359560	And that didn't go well either.
13359560	13360560	And I tried duck egg.
13360560	13362560	And I went to the hospital as well.
13362560	13365560	So, I'm pretty sure all kinds of bird eggs are bad.
13371560	13373560	And I've even tried balut.
13373560	13375560	But, uh...
13375560	13377560	I also died from that.
13377560	13378560	So, something...
13378560	13380560	Something about eggs, bad.
13382560	13385560	So, I've been to the hospital several times.
13386560	13387560	Fish eggs are fine.
13387560	13389560	I don't know why, but fish eggs are fine.
13393560	13395560	Mama tried to kill you if she tried.
13395560	13397560	Um, let's just say I...
13397560	13401560	It wasn't until a long time into my childhood
13401560	13403560	that I, um...
13404560	13408560	That the doctors have finally found out that I was allergic to eggs.
13416560	13418560	So, I was kind of like force fed.
13418560	13420560	And like eggs for a while.
13420560	13422560	A lot, um...
13422560	13424560	Oh, this is gonna sound bad.
13424560	13425560	I was...
13426560	13428560	I was punished a lot.
13429560	13430560	In my youth.
13431560	13433560	Especially by relatives.
13433560	13435560	I was punished a lot in my youth.
13437560	13439560	Because they all thought I was just a picky eater.
13446560	13448560	Then they punished you by mail.
13448560	13450560	They punished force feeding me.
13451560	13452560	It's...
13452560	13454560	It was pretty much child abuse.
13457560	13458560	And, uh...
13458560	13460560	Other methods.
13461560	13464560	But I would always say to my parents,
13464560	13465560	like, it hurts to eat.
13465560	13466560	It hurts to eat.
13466560	13468560	And they didn't get it.
13468560	13470560	They didn't get it.
13475560	13478560	They just thought I was a picky eater.
13485560	13488560	But it wasn't until, I guess,
13488560	13491560	when I was almost nearing pre-teens,
13491560	13493560	where the doctors were like,
13493560	13497560	we found out why you're hospitalized all the time.
13499560	13502560	Hahaha.
13509560	13510560	But it's fine now.
13510560	13511560	It's fine now.
13511560	13515560	Now I know what I'm allergic to and now...
13515560	13517560	and what to avoid.
13518560	13519560	So, yeah.
13519560	13521560	Hahaha.
13521560	13531500	I probably thought it was healthy back then, but no, definitely they're like, okay, no,
13531500	13535620	no, no, no, no, you're not gonna get this because I definitely, when they force fed
13535620	13543620	me to eat things, it was like hospitalized afterwards all the time.
13543620	13552620	Oops, it's fine now, don't worry.
13552620	13560620	Childhood trauma, nobody can trauma dump on me, I trauma dump on everyone else.
13574620	13588620	But yeah, my sister definitely ran away because my parents are definitely overbearing.
13588620	13598620	They are definitely overbearing, but they do love us.
13598620	13606620	They do love us, trust me, I know.
13606620	13613620	And I think they relaxed quite a bit, they relaxed quite a bit.
13613620	13622620	When I was in school though, they were very strict, they were very, very strict.
13622620	13628620	They were very strict, but then now I feel kind of weird.
13628620	13638620	I kind of feel kind of weird because now I have a lot of freedom and I don't get in trouble as much anymore.
13638620	13644620	Or even at all, I don't really get in trouble at all.
13644620	13651620	So it kind of feels weird suddenly gaining all this freedom.
13651620	13653620	I guess.
13653620	13661620	My sister ran away sort of like the moment she was able to, when she graduated high school, she was like,
13661620	13668620	okay, I'm going to study right now, bye.
13668620	13670620	Do you like it, do you miss it?
13670620	13676620	The kind of strangulating strictness, not really.
13676620	13680620	It just still feels weird, does that make sense?
13680620	13683620	It just feels strange.
13683620	13690620	Because you know, my entire life was like, I was brought up pretty strictly,
13690620	13702620	and then now it's just like, oh okay, you're an adult now, feel free to do whatever you want.
13702620	13706620	What made the change happen?
13706620	13708620	I don't know.
13709620	13720620	I guess when I, when, I guess it's at the time they were like, well, here you go.
13727620	13731620	Freedom's nice, you guys don't get that right though.
13731620	13737620	At least I don't get that right.
13737620	13746620	I guess, I guess like, they were just like, oh, you're done school now?
13746620	13749620	Do whatever you want.
13749620	13753620	But then I guess, I don't know, I guess in a way they were overbearing,
13753620	13759620	but now they're begging me not to leave.
13759620	13766620	I guess that makes sense.
13767620	13770620	Yeah.
13779620	13786620	But like I said earlier in stream, when I had an internship in Japan,
13786620	13791620	I had an internship in Japan, I moved to Japan for three months,
13791620	13796620	and I was telling Mama and Papa like, oh yeah, if I get a job there,
13796620	13800620	I might, I might, you know, I might move, I might move here.
13800620	13804620	And they said, you're moving to Japan? Okay, we're gonna come too.
13804620	13819620	They were like, they were so adamant.
13819620	13821620	And I was like, oh, I don't know, like maybe.
13821620	13824620	And they were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we'll get a house with you.
13824620	13827620	We'll get a house with you and we'll move in.
13827620	13830620	We'll move in together as a family.
13834620	13854620	I mean, they've already said to me like, if I ever move to Europe,
13854620	13856620	they want to come with me.
13856620	13858620	If I ever move to like Australia, they'll come with me.
13858620	13868620	If I move to the US, they'll come with me.
13868620	13870620	They'll come with me.
13899620	13901620	Man, I'm so stupid.
13914620	13919620	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, everyone lives in my basement.
13919620	13927620	I think, I think I might have been easy to figure it out.
13927620	13930620	Oops.
13930620	13933620	Oh, whatever.
13933620	13936620	Oh, whatever.
13936620	13942620	Wow, got sad with the bag.
13942620	13951620	Anyways, yeah.
13951620	13967620	Yeah, they wanted to stick around all the times, I guess.
13967620	13970620	My bad.
13970620	13973620	So yeah, they definitely were like, oh, yeah, we want to move.
13973620	13979620	When I told them, I told my parents recently like, oh, hey, I want to move out,
13979620	13982620	but I want to move out really close so I can have my privacy.
13982620	13984620	They were like, oh, you want to move to a new house?
13984620	13985620	Sure.
13985620	13988620	Sure, everyone, right?
13988620	13994620	And I went, no, I meant alone.
13994620	13996620	Maybe alone.
13996620	14004620	No, no, you bring us with you.
14004620	14014620	Anyways, I was like, no, no, I mean, like, alone without you for my independence.
14014620	14022620	And they went, did we do something wrong?
14022620	14026620	Did we do something wrong?
14026620	14030620	Why don't you like us, like us anymore?
14030620	14043620	I was like, oh, no.
14043620	14058620	Oh, yeah, I do get it from my mom.
14059620	14066620	Is Mama Modiste also a yander?
14066620	14069620	A bit.
14069620	14074620	A bit, actually.
14074620	14076620	Actually, she went out of nowhere.
14076620	14085620	Out of nowhere, came up to me and was like, if, if, honey, honey, if you ever get a boyfriend and he hurts you, I'll kill him.
14085620	14087620	I'll fucking kill him.
14087620	14111620	She literally said, said, I'll fucking kill him.
14111620	14117620	Papa was the same thing.
14117620	14127620	It kind of does run in the family, yeah.
14127620	14136620	So, yeah, Mama, Mama was like, you know, yeah, she can be a little, she can be really scary sometimes.
14136620	14144620	Like, she, oh my gosh, sometimes I think she's psychic.
14144620	14159620	But she knows a lot, she knows a lot of things, and I'm just like.
14159620	14165620	She knows a lot of things, and it kind of scares me because sometimes she reads my mind.
14165620	14170620	Oh, yeah, she did predict my viewer career.
14170620	14173620	She, okay, do you guys, okay.
14173620	14182620	I didn't get to say this in, I didn't get to say this in debut 2.0 because I got really tired.
14182620	14191620	Because I got sick before stream and then I got really tired, so I had to only hit around like the two hour ish mark.
14191620	14196620	But, um, what was it?
14196620	14206620	Um, so Mama comes from a little bit of a family of like fortune tellers.
14206620	14228620	So in Vietnam, um, they have a fortune, uh, fortune telling, fortune telling using regular playing cards.
14228620	14234620	And so out of nowhere, she just decided to read my, read my fortune.
14234620	14244620	Mmm, no, no, no, not tarot cards, like a regular playing deck. So with like the suits and stuff.
14244620	14249620	Yeah, like kind of how you would, but it's like, uh, it's Vietnamese style.
14249620	14261620	So it's very common if you go to Vietnam, you'll see people do this type of fortune telling.
14261620	14273460	So she was like, okay, your career is something to do with the internet.
14273460	14279860	You're going to meet a woman who's going to help you achieve your goals.
14279860	14287860	Your work is going to not necessarily be normal, but if it's going to be lots of hard work,
14287860	14301460	but it's going to be lots of hard work, but it will be fruitful.
14301460	14305300	It will be fruitful and quite lucrative.
14306180	14318180	And the woman that you will meet wears primarily black or has black hair.
14325380	14330580	And that's what that's what she said. And then that was it. That was it. And this was
14331140	14337300	a month, months before I found out about violour.
14339300	14344020	Do you have fortune telling powers? I can do a bit of fortune telling.
14344020	14359540	I can do a little fortune telling, not lotto numbers, but like tarot cards.
14360260	14362660	Like tarot cards, I can do it a little bit.
14362980	14378020	But I think mama thought that teaching kids online is kind of a little bit different,
14378020	14382900	because it's not physically teaching people online and stuff.
14387140	14390500	So I guess mama thought it was something like that.
14393220	14395540	So it's not really a normal job.
14399220	14404740	So I can do it. Sometimes even my friends, they've liked my fortune
14405460	14413220	telling so much that they've actually gotten paid to do it. I'm still a beginner, Bill.
14413220	14418660	In my opinion, I'm still a beginner, but mama thinks I inherited the gift from the family.
14419380	14424020	It sounds a little weird, right? It's like, oh, you know, you're pretty good at this.
14424020	14431380	Yeah, maybe as you know, mama's side of the family has a bit of like a history to fortune
14431380	14445060	telling and stuff. I think you mentioned the fortune telling before,
14445060	14450820	or maybe Shibi said something very similar. Probably. It was probably, maybe Shibi mentioned it.
14450820	14459220	We talked about like tarot cards and stuff, because they're kind of into like that as well.
14459220	14464420	I do a lot of good luck stuff, because I don't know, it just makes me feel safer.
14470420	14474100	It's just for fun, though. It's just for fun. Fortune telling and stuff is just for fun.
14474100	14478260	So don't take it seriously, guys. Don't take it seriously, Senpai.
14480660	14486580	But yeah, mama, mama, mama definitely pulled me out of nowhere and did that. And you know what?
14486580	14494340	Because she's my mama. I'm generally like, okay, I'm listening. I don't know why she does it,
14494340	14500900	how she does it, but like, you know, every time she says something bad will happen today, don't go
14500900	14505140	out. And then like, you know, I go out and then something terrible happens. And I'm like, oh,
14506340	14508580	I saw, I listen, I listen to her a lot.
14512820	14517140	I listen to her a lot, because I'm just like, she knows something that I don't.
14519140	14521380	She knows something that I don't, I don't.
14526420	14528260	You know, it's just one of those things where I'm like,
14528900	14532660	okay, I don't know a whole lot about this, but I'm just going to listen to my mama.
14542260	14543140	That advice time.
14546660	14550500	Understood. Here is your advice. Don't be ugly.
14550900	14558900	You hear that, senpai? I hope this helps.
14566660	14573700	Sounds like a good advice to me. Solid advice.
14580900	14589220	Not gonna lie, my entire PC, Wi-Fi and power shut down, right? This is about how we talked about
14589220	14597460	tarot cards. Oh, shit. Yeah, I don't know, mama, it's probably a coincidence, but like, mama,
14597460	14603140	mama truly believes in that type of stuff. So I, I tend to listen to her because I feel like,
14603140	14607940	I don't know, you ever have the sage mother and father advice. And then you're just like,
14607940	14612340	yeah, they know something more than I do. So I'm just going to listen. I don't care if it sounds
14612340	14626580	kind of weird. I don't care if it sounds kind of weird or if it sounds like, you know, like
14627300	14630820	weird, bad, just, uh.
14639380	14641700	So I just listen, listen to mama.
14646660	14650900	But yeah, mama is trying to teach me to do Vietnamese fortune telling,
14650900	14655140	but it's so complex and I don't know certain words and I'm just like, I don't get it.
14655780	14656500	I don't get it.
14660100	14665220	I don't get it. This is hard. I just stuck with tarot cards instead because I was like, okay,
14665220	14666340	this I can understand.
14671940	14674340	Maybe a stream to practice? I don't know.
14674340	14694260	I would not allow mama, mama, modest to come teach on stream. I would not allow them. Listen,
14694260	14701860	if they asked me, honey, Netflix stopped working. Can you call them and tell them to make it work
14701860	14705460	again? You think I'm going to let them on stream?
14717780	14725940	Immediately, immediately, I would get Doc's hardcore. Are these your students, sweetie?
14726900	14731620	Hi from address, address, address, address, address, address.
14733460	14734980	How do you know my
14745460	14751380	Like I would be instantly Doc's. I could make an entire, listen, listen, listen.
14751860	14766020	Listen, it took me years and I have still not have succeeded in teaching Papa how to use a cell
14766020	14778420	phone, a flip phone. I, when I, I was like, here to pick up, you just open the phone and you know
14778900	14780340	what, what Papa did?
14784260	14791300	He said, okay, I got it. He opens the flip phone and closes it again and puts it against his
14791300	14794180	ear and goes, hello, it's not working.
14794180	14821700	Oh my gosh. And I, I didn't even know.
14824980	14828180	Do you know how hard it was to teach them how to use Netflix?
14829860	14838260	It was pretty hard and I taught them and I was only able to teach them because the, the little, uh,
14840740	14847140	the, the remote that come, I don't know, I think it was like a Blu-ray player
14847940	14853620	comes with the remote that says, that has a button that says Netflix.
14861860	14868180	And I just like, click this button, tap this button and it will take you to Netflix.
14870820	14875460	And then if you want to watch, watch anything, press these button and hit okay.
14876420	14879940	Okay. It took me a long time.
14883460	14889380	It took me a long time, but I managed to teach them how to use Netflix.
14893220	14899060	It's, it was tough. It was tough. So there is no way. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
14900020	14905060	but you will not be able to meet my, my parents on stream.
14906820	14912820	I've tried multiple times to tell them what my job is and they said, oh, you teach. Oh, okay.
14912820	14917780	So you, you teach kids online how to speak English, right?
14921220	14922980	And at this point, I say, yeah, sure.
14922980	14932260	I just say, do they call you every time Netflix logs out the account? Yes. Yes, they do.
14936660	14941780	They do. If they go on the wrong profile, they start crying and telling me,
14941780	14946580	why isn't there old, their show that they were currently watching on this profile?
14946580	14948180	No.
14962020	14966020	But how will we ask them for your hand in marriage or lie? Well,
14966020	14969940	I already have a plan set up. So don't step out of it. Okay. Senpai.
14970500	14982100	So I was like, it's okay though. They think that every anime I watch is either Inuyash or
14982100	14996900	Sailor Moon cause I was obsessed with them as a kid. So please trust me. This is a,
14996900	15007860	this is a long process, but I promise Senpai, we'll have our happily ever after together.
15007860	15026340	Just trust, trust the process. Trust the process.
15030020	15031540	Don't worry, they'll meet you.
15031540	15044020	For now, though, they believe that you're my little student.
15061780	15068900	That's what they believe. You're my, you're my, you're my Senpai, but they believe that you're my
15068900	15081140	students. I think that's really funny though. I think it's really funny.
15081140	15088740	So remember, let's have a little secret together.
15111140	15136740	I still have to get used to my new, new routine.
15141540	15146340	I'm also sad. Wow.
15154980	15161540	I'll just, I'll just beat these guys first and then run to like a save point and then we'll do a
15161540	15179140	little chat and then I'll um, and then I'll, I'll head on.
15192260	15195140	So
15213780	15215780	that's the wrong way. I do have to go this way.
15216500	15219940	Through it, we're running.
15224260	15224500	Bye.
15230420	15231780	They know you're trying to leave.
15234660	15242180	They know they're, that I'm trying to leave and that they want me to stay just like my Senpai.
15243140	15243780	Right?
15246900	15248900	Okay. Yeah, let's save here.
15251780	15252180	Ooh.
15257460	15259380	Oh wait, everybody saved.
15263140	15264980	I forgot how to get to the menu again.
15272180	15282180	All right.
15292340	15296180	And close your eyes, Senpai. Flashbang.
15302980	15314180	Back to color.
15314180	15324180	Um, um, um.
15327700	15334100	Sorry I cough so, so much Senpai and like player might throw it a lot. I've been a bit sick.
15335380	15342660	Actually ever since before, the day before debut. I think I got a bit sick from basically stress.
15343460	15347700	Stress, nerves, all of the emotions rolled up into one.
15355700	15358180	So I've been, I've been coughing a little bit
15360500	15365620	and clearing my throat a little bit more. I do get a little bit flummy. So yeah.
15365620	15373140	Feeling better now? I think I'm getting to the tail end of it, but I still have like the cough and stuff.
15376580	15381620	I feel bad that I'm not always in my like tip top shape when uh, screaming.
15382260	15398500	Yeah. Yeah, debut was so stressful for me. When I first did debut, I was, I was, I wanted to make
15398500	15409540	such a good impression because I was worried that a lot of people would scrutinize the allure
15409540	15416900	more than usual. So I really tried my best. I tried my best to make a good first impression.
15424500	15434660	So yeah, and I was worried that, that you know, after debut, um, you know, people would be like,
15435540	15440420	would be, would scrutinize, scrutinize a little more as well.
15443540	15448420	So I was like, oh no, I have to impress my senpais. After all, I'm their kohai
15449060	15455140	and, and they'll need to love me and I'll be really sad if they don't like me.
15455940	15469300	So I'm really happy that I made, uh, at least a decent impression on my senpais.
15472180	15474580	Well, as long as, uh, everything's all good.
15477300	15481460	Okay, I leaned my arm onto this table so much, made an event.
15485220	15491860	So yeah, let's see if I have any, any news or something coming up. Let me take a look.
15491860	15497300	See, I know it's pretty light right now. Sorry for yapping so much about my family.
15501780	15506500	Here, let's see my schedule. Well, all my, I've, I've posted up all my schedule already.
15507300	15510660	I'm pretty, pretty cool with that.
15510740	15520500	Uh, okay, we have merch from Uwu Market. That's already done. Tomorrow is my
15523460	15525940	first ever ASMR stream.
15531700	15536260	It's my first ever ASMR stream, so I hope, uh, senpais will tune into that.
15537140	15544980	Am I a little nervous? Yeah, I'm a little nervous about it. Um, I had some things planned,
15544980	15553220	but because of, um, YouTube kind of cracking down on certain things, I'm going to have to just
15553220	15562100	readjust some things. Um, it's going to be safe for work. So have no worries about that. I'm not
15562100	15569860	going to go, you know, but I'm going to, uh,
15577220	15579860	I mean, is I'm here?
15580740	15592100	Oh, hi! I'm from Umapluses here. Wow. Umapluses is, uh, is another,
15592820	15599620	is, uh, is another, uh, V2 company that everyone should check out. Really cute girls.
15599620	15618180	Um, so, um, let's see, my, my ASMR stream is going to be, uh, a lot of pampering. I went out already.
15618180	15625860	I went out and got everyone, um, the kind of, the, the, the ice globe, the ice globe rollers,
15626500	15634020	and I've got, uh, a gel mask, uh, that I think makes a nice sound, I think. Um,
15642180	15646260	um, so I'm going to try to pamper, pamper my senpais.
15646740	15652820	Do you do heartbeat? Um, I'm not sure I'll do heartbeat.
15653860	15663060	Um, I think you'll have to go tomorrow to see what I'm planning. I'm not sure if it's going to be,
15664100	15669780	um, typical because I, I, to be honest, I'm just jumping and blinded.
15670740	15679300	Uh, to be honest, I'm jumping and blind, so I've, I've never really watched, um, other ASMR videos.
15682020	15686900	Yeah, it's going to be whispers. I promise you it'll be relaxing. It'll be relaxing whispers.
15690740	15697300	So, I, I haven't studied visually or auditorially because I don't know, I just,
15698260	15704580	I'm very sensitive to sound, so I, I have trouble studying, um, other people's videos, so I've been
15705780	15711300	kind of doing it in a way where I've been just reading about it.
15717380	15721860	So, I'm definitely going to pamper, pamper my, my senpais.
15722020	15732500	I'm going to pamper my senpais, but uh, don't worry though. I've been studying sometimes,
15732500	15738100	a lot of times. Strawny send me things if she's like, you need improvement in this area. Here,
15738100	15743620	here's an example. I do take the time to watch those videos that she sends me.
15744420	15754500	So, hopefully, uh, it works out. I'm going to see if it works. Let me know. Senpais, I hope you let me
15754500	15764020	know if something's, uh, too strong or too sensitive, so I'm not really sure, um, about how ASMR is,
15764020	15769380	but I did, I did some reading, I did some reading about it, so hopefully I'll do it in my own little way.
15774020	15780260	If it's Strawny, those are probably some interesting training videos.
15782020	15783860	Am I allowed to say this?
15788420	15795380	Sometimes Strawny's like, nope, that wasn't good enough. Here, go practice.
15795380	15805140	And then I would have to re-record and stuff.
15805140	15824260	Strawny, Strawny, um, definitely is, is, uh, guiding me, guiding me a lot.
15824340	15840500	So, um, if something, there's, there's one I know, I'm not very proud of my very first,
15840500	15846820	one of my very first audios for Patreon. I'm not very proud of, so what if you, if you hear it?
15847780	15850900	I think I did an okay job on it, but I feel like I
15853460	15858420	would, I would improve, I should improve more. I'm learning from my mistakes,
15858420	15863060	so I feel like it's not, it's not the best quality, it's because I am a beginner.
15863860	15879620	Enjoy learning? Of course, I enjoy learning. It's, it's a part of my likes, my hobbies.
15879620	15885700	I love research, I love learning. I very much have kind of like a research-esque mind.
15893060	15901620	So yeah, uh, please understand if, if there's any harsh comments, uh, this, uh, when I first recorded
15901620	15911380	all of those, uh, all of those, uh, recordings were definitely, uh, a month plus in advance.
15912180	15918980	So, the following month should be better, but I think it might be, I think I'm still,
15919060	15921860	still learning, so I'll try to improve over time.
15925220	15931300	The first audio was good, good. I think that one was, I think I found a little more confident in
15931300	15944980	that one. In, in, in that one, uh, so Strani's definitely helping me. The other girls, girls,
15945540	15951780	uh, are definitely helping me as well. So yeah, uh, I think a lot of us are, are definitely noobs,
15951780	15959860	but I think, uh, they've, they've dabbled, they've dabbled in, in ASMR a little bit more than me.
15959860	15966340	Me, I, I'm completely new, I'm completely new, so I'm just like, oh okay, Strani's, Strani's has taught
15966340	15980180	me in her own way. Um, yeah. Azura said she's new too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think Azura is not
15980180	15983700	ignorant. When I came in, I was like, I don't even know what a trigger is.
15997060	16000980	I was like, trigger? Like, oh my devil trigger.
16006340	16008820	Oh, like a gun trigger. Is that a popular race?
16019700	16024340	Is there a way would you like feedback structured or would you let, let you go on your own pace?
16025060	16032180	Um, I think Strani and I know where my weaknesses are, but I don't mind a little bit of constructive
16032180	16038420	criticism, but not mean criticism. I will cry. And if I go, if I cry, uh, someone's gonna pay for it.
16044100	16045300	I hope that makes sense.
16045300	16058980	Uh, you can give my feedback through my moral. It's fine. I do read through my morals. I'm sorry
16058980	16063540	I haven't really replied to a lot of them. I, I have been reading all of them though, but a lot
16063540	16067140	of questions that have been coming in have been things I've already addressed. So I was like,
16067140	16074900	I don't know if I should answer this or I'm, or I'm shy about answering because some of them are very,
16074900	16083860	if you are very personal and I'm just like, uh, I'm very thankful and they're, they're mine.
16083860	16088180	They're mine and only mine. No, I'm not even Senpai gets to see my reaction.
16095060	16100900	What limits do you have on questions mask? No, you mean, what do you mean?
16105460	16108660	Like, what questions do I not like?
16112100	16118100	Um, I guess questions that blushing mercy. Yeah. If I read some of them, I'm like,
16123220	16129940	what do you want us to not ask about? Well, if things have are, are kind of easily findable.
16130820	16135380	So like, if you're like, oh, do you play hentai games or arrow gay?
16137060	16144020	Well, I address that in my debut. Um, if I, if, oh, do you like this anime and it's in my debut,
16144020	16147540	I'm going to be really, I get a little, I get a little miffed, you know?
16151860	16158020	I get a little miffed if someone asks me, how do I, uh, if they ask me a question about how
16158100	16161620	the internal system works? I don't know. That's a question for strongy.
16165380	16174340	So risk a questions are fine for you. Yes. Uh, although I may not answer it because, um, it's a journey.
16177540	16179140	It's a journey. It's a journey for me.
16188820	16201140	So, uh, yeah, kayfabe questions are okay. I feel a little bad because I dropped kayfabe a lot.
16208500	16209140	Um,
16210100	16226820	yeah, I feel like most questions are free and on the table if, oh, I know some questions that I don't
16226820	16231540	like. I've been recently getting questions that I don't like, that I know that I don't like. I feel
16231540	16240420	like they're baiting for me to answer in order to, to induce some rage. And I don't like that.
16243220	16246820	I don't like that. And I think those are not my senpais. I think those are trolls.
16253060	16260020	I think those are trolls. So I don't like that. I don't like questions about, um,
16261700	16266580	like pineapple and pizza kind of question. No, no, no, like, uh,
16269780	16271860	more offensive questions, you know?
16276980	16284260	So, like pineapple and pizza, by the way, is good. My favorite pizza is pineapple in
16284260	16287780	my room. So anyone else can fight me. You can try.
16294740	16297780	But like questions that are definitely, um,
16303700	16309620	definitely questions that are definitely trying to get a riot out of me or someone else. Does that
16309700	16319060	make sense? So I don't like political questions. I don't like, um, questions about,
16320020	16330180	like, personal things about me. So, um, no, let's just, I, I've, instead, I haven't seen
16330180	16337940	any of my morals yet, but I've had people ask me questions in the past where it's like,
16337940	16344500	where do you live? Tell me where you live. What's your phone number? I want to give you a call,
16344500	16353620	personal call. That type of thing. I don't like things by invading my privacy. So those are
16354180	16358100	kind of like, I feel like it's kind of common. These are common questions.
16359060	16370980	But I definitely don't like questions that are like, you know, trolls and stuff. So,
16373940	16378820	yeah, so it's, it's kind of like the basic etiquettes. Just remember basic etiquettes and
16378820	16384500	most likely I will, I will answer it or I will keep that question in my mind to answer in the
16384500	16391140	future because maybe I don't know. I don't know. And I'm, I'm still discovering pieces of myself as
16391140	16403060	well. So for example, I don't know how to, like, if someone says, what are you into? I feel like
16404820	16409940	the, that question's a little hard for me because I don't really know what I'm into.
16410500	16414500	And I'm also slowly discovering what I'm into and what I'm not into, I guess.
16418100	16419620	Like, yeah.
16422900	16427700	Those questions are fine. I just feel like I don't have the ability to answer them now.
16427700	16430500	I don't have the knowledge of myself to answer them now.
16433620	16434260	Things like that.
16435220	16441140	So, we're all, we're all learning together. And then once I find out if I don't like something,
16441140	16442260	I'll let you know.
16447620	16452500	It's like trying food, you know, I'm still trying a lot of food. So I don't really know, like, oh,
16452500	16458100	I do like this, but, oh, do you, I've never tried this before. So I don't know if I like it or not.
16464260	16474740	That makes us your students. Your mom was 100% on our prediction. I think it's more like
16475380	16480580	senpais are teaching me, I think. I think my senpais are more like mentoring me.
16486580	16492820	I know my mods are supposed to be silent, but I thank you for my mods as well. I see a lot of
16493460	16499700	senpais also show appreciation for them. So thank you. Thank you mods. Shut up, but also thank you.
16505380	16507700	I truly, I truly do appreciate the hard work.
16523380	16532500	So I really appreciate them. Shout outs, shout outs to mods.
16539780	16543060	Especially when I say things like cut off his testicles.
16543060	16548340	My lesson to me. I'm so appreciative of that.
16554020	16555380	No, they're doing really good.
16562500	16570660	Good. But yeah, I appreciate it. This is actually my first time talking to so many people as well.
16570660	16576900	So I appreciate having all the help that I can get, especially the, my gen mates help me a lot,
16576900	16580340	and scrawny helps me a lot, and manager helps me a lot.
16589220	16594420	Mods destroy them. Next time I'll be like, oh, look, I pulled out my mods card.
16594980	16597700	Maw moderators obliterate.
16611460	16613060	Put mods in attack mode.
16613060	16634740	And I put one of my mods face down.
16643060	16657380	Wait, do you actually know Yu-Gi-Oh? I've only watched the anime. I've never really played it.
16657380	16670740	I don't know how to play like Yu-Gi-Oh Yu-Gi-Oh, but I've only watched the anime. I think the first season.
16673780	16697060	So I only know a few cards as well, mostly Exodia. In fact, I have like, do you guys know that collab
16697060	16706260	with Hello Kitty? The McDonald's collab? Hello Kitty? And it's like the Yu-Gi-Oh Hello Kitty
16706260	16715220	collab? I have like, on one of my, one of my lights here. I forgot to turn off my lights,
16715220	16727380	turned on my lights today, but one of my lights here is a pom-pom pudding Exodia.
16734100	16739940	Yeah, that's Hello Kitty with Yu-Gi-Oh's hair. It's hilarious, right? So I have, I have that one.
16740500	16746180	I have, that's the one I wanted. That's the one I wanted. I also have,
16747060	16752900	wow, this one I'm going to give to a friend of mine. I have Pochakko as the time wizard.
16753860	16762500	And I have my melody as a dark magician girl. And I also have
16763140	16772900	um, uh, the cinnamon roll blue eyes my dragon. What's your favorite Hello Kitty character,
16772900	16779380	Kohai? Um, pom-pom pudding. I love, I love pom-pom pudding's butthole. I think it's a charm point.
16779380	16790580	I think it's cute. What? What do you mean? No one knows about the butthole? Everyone,
16790580	16800260	look at pom-pom pudding's butthole. I think it's cute. If a product does not have the butthole,
16800260	16811620	I do not buy it. I do not buy it. Um, my second favorites are probably Little Twin Stars. I think
16811620	16826500	they're cute. Is my end area Hello Kitty girl? Um, I don't own a lot of Hello Kitty stuff. I do
16826500	16833780	like Hello Kitty, but I don't own a lot of Hello Kitty stuff. So if, for example, uh, I don't just
16833780	16840580	buy things because it's Hello Kitty or anything. To be honest, I'm kind of like trying to not really
16840580	16845540	want a lot of things. So the things on my wish list are kind of like things that I've been like
16845540	16853380	thinking about a lot or just a tiny treat. Uh, mostly from, I think a lot of them are just things
16853380	16867460	that I, I think will improve my stream. So things that will help improve my stream. So, uh, right
16867460	16876580	now, uh, the Senpai, thank you Senpais for gifting me things, uh, so far. Um, I'm still reading through
16876580	16885060	it. I, I'm actually, I recently received a, uh, the, the nausea, uh, bracelet thing. So hopefully
16885060	16891220	it works out for some streams so that I can, I can use that. I'll test that out for streams, uh,
16891300	16898180	for first person stuff. Uh, the blanket is already behind me. It's kind of airing out right now,
16898820	16903220	because it's, it's kind of, it arrived kind of like with the factory sense. So I'm, I'm airing it
16903220	16909780	out a little bit. Um, it's working great right now. If it's working great, if you can hear my audio,
16910740	16917300	um, I'm kind of, I'm kind of happy with my audio. I'm happy with my audio,
16917540	16922660	with my audio setup right now. I think it's pretty good. I think it's pretty good. Uh,
16924420	16929700	I've covered some areas where I think, uh, has a little bit of a reverberation. I've,
16929700	16934420	I've covered those areas. So I think, I think it's pretty good now. I think, uh, mind you,
16934420	16939700	the space I'm in right now that I can only fit myself in is like kind of, is the open area in
16939700	16948580	the basement is the open area in the basement. So there's like stairs here and like lots of
16948580	16960820	crevices and stuff. So I'm trying my best. I'm trying my best. I tried my best to sound, uh,
16960900	16969620	as, as good as possible for my supplies. Um, yeah, I'm raining through some of the manuals for some
16969620	16975620	stuff. Uh, everything arrived. Everything, everything's arrived. So yeah.
16979780	16985300	Thought the Ku 100 mic, isn't that like $8,000? Now it's way more than that.
16985860	16989860	Uh, I put an LOL on that. It was kind of a joke. It was kind of a joke.
16993860	16999860	It's a, it's more of a joke. I put it there for like, ha ha, look at me. I'm so passionate about ASMR.
17002820	17008820	There's a reason why in there it says, uh, it says LOL.
17008820	17018420	You say that until it's bought. I don't think anyone's going to buy that, to be honest.
17019380	17023220	Do you guys think, uh, I should take it off then?
17024660	17027860	You should take it off the list then? I put it there as like kind of like a,
17028580	17041780	uh, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm experimenting and I hear it's pretty good, but it's, it's quite a big upgrade.
17047220	17051700	I think, uh, if I had to choose one thing that I would really, really, really want,
17051700	17058420	would be the U87. I think I would really love the U87 more than the Ku 100.
17068180	17076260	Keep it on, keep it on, keep it, take it off. Maybe, maybe I should take it off.
17076260	17079780	I don't know. I feel a little guilty for putting it on because I, uh, maybe that,
17080340	17085940	I put the precedence on, um, someone, someone to, to try to get it.
17094100	17097140	Yeah, I'll probably remove it. Heck, I'll remove it right now.
17097140	17112020	Whoa, I can remove it right now. Don't worry, Sunpie.
17116340	17119220	There you go. It's gone into the ether.
17127140	17135860	It's gone now. Excuse me. Wow.
17144980	17149220	But yeah, um, my wishlist stuff, yeah.
17149220	17150420	Haha.
17156580	17157300	Vanished.
17162500	17166180	Are you okay? Hi, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. I just feel I'm still a little bit of sick,
17166180	17170660	so I will get like, plummy and coffee all the time, all the, every once in a while.
17173300	17178820	It's also pretty cold in the basement, so I get pretty sick easily in the basement.
17179220	17181880	I'm streaming like right beside all my supplies
17183900	17185900	Yeah, I sent it to the shadow realm
17186300	17187980	That's a tea by the way
17187980	17192500	Good, but it's so cold down here. Like usually these mugs can hold
17195940	17197580	Can hold like
17197580	17201300	Heat for a while, but because it's so cold down here. It can get
17202140	17204720	Really fast and go get cold really fast
17205500	17211140	Yeah, we know it's cold. I provided lots of blankets
17217360	17223460	Yeah, you're about to hit the five hour mark. Oh shit. I'm such a yapper. I'm sorry
17229360	17231660	Can we try using a thermos for your tea I
17232460	17234460	I didn't think about that
17240380	17243320	I was like I do have a thermos as far soup though
17244780	17249340	But I'm also like I kind of wanted to cool it down a little bit. I may be at thermos might be too hot
17249340	17251340	I
17262620	17268380	Don't worry. I already have one. I already have a thermos. I bought it for soups. I actually bought it for school
17269100	17271420	Uh, I ended up not using it for school
17274700	17277420	So I guess I was saving it for camping or something
17280300	17287900	I'm camping with senpai. Let me know the forest. Don't worry about the barrel and the bone saw and
17288300	17290460	you know the copulous amount of
17292300	17293740	Acid
17293740	17299820	That I'm bringing along. I don't look good. I don't like that. Do you like camping? I do like the outdoors. I
17301180	17303180	Like the outdoors. It's calming
17309740	17315740	Someone said they found a bone while we were cleaning our ping-pong mess earlier. Oh, don't worry about it
17322780	17324780	This isn't in the beach this is an acid bag
17324780	17326780	I
17337500	17345100	Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. But yeah, yeah, I'll take I'll take it off most things. I just kind of want or
17347580	17349180	Or I
17349180	17351820	It's things to improve the screen except for the size of fumo
17351820	17357340	That's kind of like a want because I don't know. I don't have a lot of saw. I'm a really big fan of siren outa
17360620	17363020	A new plan on keeping us from running off in the forest
17368140	17370140	Ah
17371180	17376940	Sometimes, you know, maybe a little broken ankle might might hurt hurt your chances a little bit
17382060	17384060	I
17395100	17399420	Give you a head start not without a handicap, of course
17399420	17401420	I
17410860	17412860	Don't want to run. Yeah
17420700	17425580	Well, if you don't want to run then we'll have a good time because then I'll be like camping and then we'll have s'mores and like
17425900	17427260	We'll roast
17427260	17431660	Roast things over a fire and tell camp stories and stuff. But if you want to run
17432540	17434540	I'll give you a head start
17437340	17439340	But you know
17440700	17442700	Maybe the animals will find you first
17447660	17451260	Whatever happened in the og senpai check out the lore video
17456460	17458460	I
17458460	17465100	Think like if we roast like, you know things over like I would love I would love to have like sweet potatoes
17465820	17468460	Over an open fire. I'll be really nice
17479900	17484140	So I think that'll be really nice to to have and like maybe have like our own little like
17484540	17486540	Fire pit barbecue wouldn't that be nice?
17492220	17494220	Is this a plan for a date of course
17497660	17500940	And then we can look at the stars together wouldn't that be nice
17509180	17512620	Like real sweet potatoes are really nice. I love it. I love it a lot
17514620	17516620	So
17517020	17520060	But if you if if senpai's decided to start running
17521100	17523980	Wow, I did bring some stuff to to help
17535500	17540460	Oh, there'll be beer. I don't really like beer actually. I don't really like drinking or
17541260	17544060	Any any vices really
17545100	17549820	It makes my senses go dull and I don't like that. I like to be alert at all times
17552620	17554780	I like root beer though. Yeah, root beer is okay
17556860	17563260	I think I got a really bad memory. Um when I was in college
17563340	17570780	Um, I went to the local like the student the student
17571580	17574940	our pub, I don't know. I don't know the difference to be honest
17575740	17577660	um
17577660	17581100	and I yeah, I was with a a group of uh
17582860	17584860	group of classmates and
17586540	17591660	Ended up leaving because I hate I hated it. I hated it. So the beer came
17592620	17594620	Uh
17595260	17597260	beer came and
17597660	17599100	Okay, uh
17599100	17603900	It was poured out into the drinks and it'll be my first time trying beer. It's like, oh, I've never tried beer before
17607020	17613020	I swear it smelled like piss it was warm
17615020	17617020	It was warm
17617580	17623340	It smelled really bad and when I tasted it it tasted like, you know
17625020	17630380	P and I was like the fucking person who served this to us like just pissing a jug
17630380	17632380	Look
17641420	17646140	Great, have you tried tried pee it tasted like what pee smells like
17650060	17653980	So it was like warm and it felt it looked like
17655580	17657660	P and I was like
17661340	17663340	Ah
17671660	17676380	It's just smells bad and it was warm and then I I was like
17678220	17685180	I asked I asked I asked the the staff I was like this is this normally served warm and they're like
17685180	17689820	Yeah, beers normally served warm like it's best. Uh, it's best uh
17690700	17692940	beer tastes best at like when it's like
17693820	17696140	You know warm and I was like
17701020	17703520	I'm gonna pay for my part and I'm gonna leave
17716140	17718140	I
17721180	17730700	I uh I left I left I I literally almost threw up in that cup. I like spat it out
17739020	17741020	Uh, I spat it out so I
17741100	17743100	I
17743100	17749500	I I I uh that was my first interaction with beer and I've never liked beer ever since
17753340	17756940	I've never liked beer ever since so if anyone just offers me beer
17757020	17762140	I just think of that moment even if it's cold. I still taste like I drink it. I'm like
17764460	17766460	You just like alcohols, um
17767180	17770220	I don't dislike it, but I tend to avoid alcohol
17771340	17777420	It it uh dulls the senses and if it dulls the senses, I can't I can't
17779420	17782620	Be at my peak around my senpai's
17786780	17793900	Like um if I'm around my gal pals my my friends, uh, we'll probably drink a little bit of like
17793980	17798620	I don't know like a long island iced tea something sweet, you know or like those
17799500	17809020	Baileys or something, but I uh last time I went drinking with workers. I uh got shit-based and uh
17810060	17814380	I'm not a good drunk. Let's just say I'm not a good drunk
17818620	17825340	Um, yeah, I'm not a good drunk. I think I told them I hated them or something
17828940	17834940	I hated them and then I hated my work and everything in front of the my boss. So let's let's not just oh, yeah, it's not
17836940	17838940	It's not good
17838940	17840940	so, uh
17841820	17844300	Did you hate them um sometimes I did
17848060	17850060	Sometimes I did so
17852140	17857180	I guess those feelings, you know one of frustrations when I was frustrated with my co-workers
17857900	17859900	um
17860060	17865020	Yeah, I'm gonna so if anyone asked for a drinking stream that's not happening
17869420	17876300	Well, will you tell us if you were drunk with us? I probably just bitch about how you keep on trying to run away from me
17880860	17883420	I was the next day at work that was my last day at work
17884300	17888300	We were doing a drinking celebration for my last day of work
17889100	17891100	I just went
17911980	17913980	Uh, so I uh, I don't drink
17914940	17919660	I don't drink and the last time and the time before that when I drunk I
17920540	17923180	uh sober I was sober in front of
17924220	17930860	The in front of the toilet uh with my barfinette. So I was like, uh, you know what?
17931580	17933580	Screw drinking
17935180	17937180	Screw screw drinking
17941740	17943740	So I don't like drinking
17944220	17946220	I
17946460	17951740	Yeah, so I I I prefer to keep my health up, especially since my health isn't the greatest
17960700	17964780	I guess my biggest vice would be like the occasional drunk food
17966780	17968620	Like um
17968700	17976220	I know like mama mama and papa's favorite celebration food is it's fried chicken and I do like fried chicken too
17992140	17997020	So yeah, I I was like I don't like, uh, I don't like drinking
17998620	18000620	So
18002300	18009100	Yeah, uh like, uh, we're basically like birthdays and stuff are celebrated with fried chicken
18017500	18022140	So I don't really I don't drink I do keep some
18023100	18028300	I've already reached five hours. Congratulations to me. Not not my record, but
18031020	18032460	Um
18032460	18040940	I do keep some drinks around with me or like, uh, if my gal pals if we're having like a a girly sleepover
18042220	18048060	We're having a girly sleepover. They want they want a little drink. Uh, I I I I I keep some just in case
18048380	18058940	Seven hours to beat strannies strannies records strannies record is 12 hours. What are you talking about?
18064140	18067020	I I do have a lot of endurance yesterday though, I definitely
18067660	18074300	Didn't have a lot of endurance probably because before I was doing the the 2.0 and I was really stressed
18079020	18087500	Oh seven hours to go five plus seven. Wow. I'm so stupid. See this is why I hate numbers. I can't do math
18093420	18098300	But yeah, if senpais like, uh, beer and stuff I will provide beer
18099180	18103740	Or like a drink for my senpais, but I won't participate myself
18104700	18109020	Are you still feeling tired? I'm still feeling tired, but I'm a yapper. It's like
18109820	18113740	You ever keep talking while you're you're like in bed
18114540	18116380	with your friends
18116380	18121740	I don't I don't know if this is a universal thing, but you're like still chatting with your friends on discord or something
18121740	18124460	And you still have the energy, but you're like, I'm so freaking tired
18134540	18136540	So, yeah, um
18145980	18148620	I know I know people find it like weird, but like
18149580	18153900	Uh, I like sleepovers with my my my my gal pals
18154780	18156300	so uh
18156300	18161020	Some uh, we'll lay like a little futon for the floor for some girls
18161820	18167980	Girls to sleep down on the floor or and then there's a bed that everyone can share as well
18172460	18173900	So, yeah
18173900	18176140	I don't know. I don't know if most people do that
18176220	18181900	But like that's like a thing that my friends do and then we we stay up and then we talk about our lives and we talk
18181980	18183980	About anything maybe theory
18184460	18186620	Maybe we watch, uh cartoons
18187100	18189900	Uh, like we marathon cartoons and stuff
18191580	18193580	So
18195180	18200860	What do you guys talk about these secret gal pals sleepovers? Oh, yeah, we like summon demons and sacrifice
18201660	18205180	Sacrifice are uh a galt just kidding
18221980	18229740	It's terrifying right now. Stop. I do hope be allure has have an off collab sleepover
18230060	18234940	I really do hope like that. I I really want to like hang out with the girls. Maybe we can do our nails and stuff
18240700	18243340	It might take a while though since we're we've got to
18245020	18248620	Congregate at one at one place and I'm gonna guess
18249500	18255020	We congregate at one place was probably gonna be at scrawny's place. So it might take a little bit of a while
18271420	18273420	So I think uh
18274140	18279180	No, I think I think we're most likely to likely to go to scrawny's
18279740	18281740	uh
18281980	18283980	Maybe um
18286380	18290620	I'd probably have to rent out if they come to me I'd have to rent out a b&b
18291900	18295660	Uh air b&b or or book a hotel room or something
18296380	18297660	but
18297660	18299660	uh
18300540	18305020	But if we go to anywhere anywhere else we'll probably have to do something similar like that
18307740	18312300	I mean if off of you allure girls it might be a far travel for some of them as well
18316220	18318220	I'm sure it'll be fine
18318540	18319500	um
18319500	18323740	Just tell your parents very fellow teachers. I think they'll be most likely
18324540	18331420	Okay with it if I'm if I'm making a bit of money and then I'm like, okay, I'm going on a little business trip
18331500	18333500	They'll be like, yeah, okay, whatever. Bye
18339900	18344300	Something like that, I think it'll be really fun and then we can like go out and have girly
18344940	18348780	Uh girly like cafe hopping or something. I think that'll be great
18349420	18351420	I
18353180	18357340	Think it'll be great. I I would love I would love that. I would love to to meet them
18358780	18364540	Um, they're also very sweet and I love them very much and I I'm very protective of them like
18365500	18367500	I'm very protective of them
18368940	18373580	I'm very protective of the girls. So like I feel like you know, if someone
18374060	18377340	Hurts their feelings. I'm like that person. They're dead to me
18379020	18381020	Oh
18385180	18386700	Like oh
18386700	18390940	Yeah, and we've all we've all been in calls and stuff and hung out and you know
18392380	18395820	It's really nice. It's really nice. I love them. I love them very much
18395820	18397820	Uh
18408380	18412940	I'm I'm lucky to have my gen maze as my friends as my friends and my gen maze
18415900	18421260	I'm really happy because uh, sometimes we talk about things like oh like what do I do like
18422140	18424060	You know
18424060	18426060	personal things
18428300	18432780	We talk about like personal things together and goals and you know
18433580	18435580	Um, when we first came in I think
18436700	18442220	I think all of us kind of like started to just talk about and kind of gushed scrawny
18443100	18445340	About how thankful we were to be here
18445740	18447740	Ha ha ha
18450620	18456540	Like honestly we were like I'm so happy to be here. I'm so glad that you gave us a chance
18462700	18465580	Sometimes we we talk about uh
18466780	18470060	What do we talk about we just talk about anything to be honest like oh cool
18470140	18475100	Look at this cute lip lip gloss. Wow and everyone's like oh that lip gloss is so cute
18481340	18486140	That's kind of that kind of thing, you know, it's fairly normal stuff that we talk about
18488860	18490860	Yeah, like something demons
18493740	18499420	Sometimes we give each other advice about things like oh, you know, uh, it's my first time doing
18500060	18506460	This type of stream. How do I fix it or like oh my audio is being kind of funky? Uh, let's let's troubleshoot it together
18515900	18517900	Kind of things like that
18518860	18522940	Or if we're like sad about something and you know, we talk about it, you know
18524380	18529340	Oh, and of course the girls share their pet their pet uh faultles
18530300	18532300	and videos of their pets as well
18533500	18539020	It's fairly fairly. Uh, what's the word am I looking for inoculus?
18542620	18544620	This is inoculus
18548060	18549900	Yeah, it's pretty
18549900	18551900	Do I have pets? No
18551900	18555980	I don't have pets. Uh mama and papa don't like animals. So I don't have a pet
18556300	18560380	How cute are emmy's rats pretty cute
18567900	18571420	I love seeing like their pets and sometimes when we're in calls
18572380	18574540	Would you get a pet? Maybe
18575580	18576940	Um
18576940	18583660	Maybe I'm I'm not very familiar with pets since I've never really grown up with any so uh, so that's a maybe
18584300	18585260	um
18585260	18591340	Depending on financial situation. I might get a pet if I can provide with them the best that I can then I would get a pet
18595180	18598460	What pet would you get maybe a cat um or a dog?
18600060	18602060	Probably something basic
18602540	18606860	Maybe a dog. I'm I'm a little bit of allergic. I'm a little bit allergic to cats
18607580	18613340	I'm a little bit allergic to the I think long-haired cats. I sneeze a lot at my eyes, kid. Don't teary
18614300	18616300	We're not your pets. Of course you're my pets
18618220	18623180	But like if you wanted like a little fluffy fluffy little friend, you know
18629020	18632220	What happened to the dog that uses cage before us I bought it new
18632620	18636380	All right, I got it off of uh, Facebook marketplace
18646620	18648620	It depends how much cage it is
18649900	18651900	They're they're not cheap
18652380	18653900	I
18653900	18655900	Clean it first, of course I cleaned it
18673660	18675660	Yeah, I'm so thoughtful
18681900	18685420	Brand new cage never used before Facebook
18692140	18694140	Only the best for senpai
18697020	18700700	I should probably head to bed now though senpai
18712620	18720140	Uh the teabag slapped me. That's what I get for joshing around
18730060	18738140	So yeah, um, what was I gonna say? Uh, yeah tomorrow is my first time as a mar followed by that. Um
18738300	18745420	Uh, I'm gonna sound like a broken record, but some people are new here and I just want to remind everyone
18745820	18750380	But after that, it will be a difficult game about climbing. That is going to be a very loud game
18750380	18754540	So if you're expecting my soothing voice, you're gonna get a lot more screams instead
18755740	18764140	Uh designing jimmies outfits, uh, they're gonna be your kind of rough sketches. So my idea is like, you know, lovely date outfits
18764540	18766540	Lovely date outfits
18768060	18769900	And uh
18769900	18773420	After that is harvester and then deathmark and then the following
18774140	18778460	Week after will be a bit of a slowdown slowdown. So I will
18779500	18781980	Probably slow down to around three streams
18782780	18784780	and then slowly
18784860	18788460	slowly build up to five five, uh
18789260	18791260	five streams a week, uh, we're uh
18794860	18798060	This uh week is full because um
18800620	18802460	Because I
18802460	18807340	Want to definitely I want to show off off fastest fastest of me to senpai
18808700	18810700	And it's debut week. So I want to show off
18811500	18815020	fastest, uh, and I don't have anything else to do
18816300	18820860	That sounds bad, but I I just I just really want to spend time with everyone
18821820	18826300	I I don't have any prior engagements this week as well
18827580	18832700	I don't have any prior engagements. Uh next week though, I'll probably on my day off uh days off
18832700	18835260	I'll probably catch one chore that I was supposed to do
18842060	18844700	I'll probably uh, and then I'll probably uh
18844700	18846700	Uh
18847020	18852220	Yeah, I'll I'll do chores and do some work on my day on my days off
18852780	18858780	It sounds bad doing work on your days off, but it's like, you know things that I'll only take, uh,
18859420	18861420	maybe two hours or so
18862380	18866220	Like uh to prepare uh things for streams and uh
18867100	18869100	Hrion and stuff
18870380	18872380	Tell senpai to do his chores
18873340	18875340	Do your chores
18883340	18885340	If the cage is clean
18902460	18906380	Uh, uh keep the cages clean. Um
18907660	18911260	I think the biggest chore that I want for all my senpais is to take care of yourself
18911900	18915660	Be at your best. Go out meet your friends
18916620	18919100	Uh try a new hobby. That's my
