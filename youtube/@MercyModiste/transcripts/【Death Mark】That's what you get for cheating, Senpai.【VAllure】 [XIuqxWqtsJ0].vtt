10:30.000 --> 10:47.740
I'm sorry everyone I uh wouldn't stop hiccuping before stream I wouldn't stop

10:47.740 --> 10:54.240
hiccuping before stream and then I drank a lot of water I wouldn't stop

10:54.240 --> 10:57.120
hiccuping and then I stopped hiccuping and then my tummy started to hurt really

10:57.120 --> 11:14.360
badly. But hello everyone. Serenity raided me I missed it I'm sorry. Serenity

11:14.360 --> 11:22.000
still here thank you for the raid and welcome everyone to the stream welcome

11:22.000 --> 11:31.120
Senpai. Today we are playing a game called Deathmark. I won't lie to you I've

11:31.120 --> 11:35.520
played a bit of this game before but then I put it on a very long hiatus and

11:35.520 --> 11:40.880
totally forgot about everything that happened to it and I did this twice

11:40.880 --> 11:49.400
already. So if I feel like I'm starting to remember some stuff that's why and I'm

11:49.400 --> 11:57.120
on a completely new account. Let's go! I mean hold on. Let's go!

11:57.120 --> 12:16.800
Hey want to hit up the karaoke place? The new love and hero song is out.

12:16.800 --> 12:28.800
I'm not feeling it. I'm not feeling up to it today. This story creeped me out

12:28.800 --> 12:41.920
earlier. Do you want to hear it? Oh chair. You remember Miss Yamaguchi? She wears

12:41.920 --> 12:57.080
those big glasses. I heard she's gone missing. What? No one knows where she is?

12:57.800 --> 13:10.160
Nope she just disappeared. Just up and poofed from the library. Okay new voice

13:10.200 --> 13:16.800
time. One of the student librarians said she was researching something there but

13:16.800 --> 13:23.080
then she vanished. But she's super diligent right? One of the students thought

13:23.080 --> 13:32.440
it was weird that she'd up and leave like that. So he checked in on her. But when he

13:32.440 --> 13:47.280
did, the only thing left was her arm. Had her really weird scar on it. So it was

13:47.280 --> 14:00.120
definitely her arm. A scar? Yeah. It looked like a dog bite. He showed it to me

14:00.120 --> 14:14.920
once. Had no idea where it came from. Burial? There was a scar like that on

14:14.920 --> 14:32.280
Miki's leg too. Huh? Miki? Wait that's the girl who went missing. Yeah. It's crazy. Maybe

14:32.280 --> 14:42.840
that rumor's true. The one about the cursed scar. Cut it out. You're scaring me. I forgot

14:42.840 --> 14:56.920
which Valley Girl was who now. Sorry. I hear snatches of an idiotic ghost stories. They're

14:56.920 --> 15:02.640
speaking seriously. It's obvious that they don't believe a word. They're only

15:02.640 --> 15:16.520
killing time. Rumors are the best way to do that. The sun's about to set. It's gotten

15:16.520 --> 15:34.400
later than I planned. I shouldn't have stuck around to hear that story. I better hurry.

15:34.400 --> 15:59.600
Bye tonight else. Thunder rumbles in the distance. A huge mansion is in front of me. Strange.

15:59.600 --> 16:11.560
I'm sure I was just. My vision blurs. My ears are buzzing. My head's swimming. It's

16:11.560 --> 16:21.280
almost like I'm drunk. What time is it? A glass at my wrist, but my watch is gone. I

16:21.280 --> 16:29.600
put it in my coat pocket. And all I find is a business card. In elegant printed letters

16:29.600 --> 16:40.560
is a name. Saya Kujo, spirit healer. On the back is a photo of the mansion. I guess this

16:40.560 --> 16:50.680
must be Kujo Mansion then? Kujo Mansion, Saya Kujo. Those names sound familiar somehow.

16:50.680 --> 16:58.000
One way to find out, taking a deep breath, I reach out to knock. I stop when I see something

16:58.000 --> 17:12.480
on my wrist. It's a strange scar. Wonder that. I could just be imagining this, but feel an

17:12.480 --> 17:29.280
icy chill when I look at it. My fur, my fists pounds on the door, no reply. A light appears

17:29.280 --> 17:34.200
in the second floor window. It's probably too far from the door for them to hear me

17:34.200 --> 17:45.560
knocking. Don't they have doorbells in this day and age? I grafts the door knob and find

17:45.560 --> 17:55.360
it unlocked. No point in staying outside. I'll just go in. I'll apologize to the owner

17:55.360 --> 18:11.400
later. Inside is shrouded in darkness. A small beam of light from the window is the

18:11.400 --> 18:17.800
only way I can see anything in here. It's dead silent except for the constant ticking

18:17.800 --> 18:29.360
of a clock's second hand. I must be in the entrance hall. The atrium extends to the second

18:29.360 --> 18:39.720
floor. Anyone home? There's no reply to my shout. Maybe they've soundproofed this place

18:39.720 --> 18:45.840
so they can't hear me downstairs. I guess I need to go upstairs then. A staircase is

18:45.880 --> 18:55.560
just visible up ahead. I walk towards it, cutting across the hall. With what light? My ears catch a

18:55.560 --> 19:08.720
strange noise. I turn to look where it's coming from. Someone's there. I fell up by the dark.

19:09.600 --> 19:24.080
I think they're staring at me. What should we do? Ten pie! I'm gonna approach them. What do you

19:24.080 --> 19:37.760
guys want to do? I'm gonna approach them. Gulping. I hesitantly make my way over.

19:37.760 --> 19:47.520
Trepidation slowing my steps. Ooh! Trepidation! That's a good idea. Word of the day everyone!

19:47.520 --> 20:04.040
Trepidation! It's a young girl. She doesn't move an inch as I approach. Girl, you just had

20:04.040 --> 20:18.720
your eyes open. I know you did. At least it seems that way to me. Doesn't look like she's even

20:18.720 --> 20:30.800
breathing. They're corpse? Great, I creep myself out. I start to sweat. What should I do?

20:30.800 --> 20:59.160
Sampai! I'm gonna do the bad touch. The shaky hand, I slowly reach out and touch your skin.

21:00.120 --> 21:11.800
I'm not sure what I expected, but it feels unnatural somehow. It's stiff and cold.

21:11.800 --> 21:30.600
I press down on her arm and she makes the strange sound I heard earlier. Ah, now it makes sense.

21:31.320 --> 21:40.840
She's a doll. A doll's joint creak when they move. That's what made the noise. Not a relief if disappointing.

21:51.080 --> 21:54.360
I carefully begin climbing the stairs, making sure not to trip.

21:54.360 --> 22:05.880
As I reach the landing, the sharp sound of a bell breaks the silence. It seems to be coming from above me.

22:05.880 --> 22:16.600
Looking up, I can spy the outline of a cloth. I bet that's what's making the sound.

22:17.160 --> 22:30.680
Should we approach it? Approach it or wait? What do you think, Sampai?

22:31.000 --> 22:38.760
It's a group activity. Wait, wait, wait, okay.

22:45.000 --> 22:45.960
Okay, let's see.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.560
I saw wait first, so we're gonna do wait.

22:54.520 --> 23:00.120
I pause and wait for the clamor to end.

23:09.640 --> 23:16.920
It doesn't seem to be stopping. Maybe it's broken. Okay, I guess we don't wait then.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.480
Should we approach it then?

23:23.720 --> 23:28.520
Approach it menacingly.

23:30.600 --> 23:36.920
Oh, the noise guides me over.

23:40.040 --> 23:46.280
It's an antique grandfather clock. The noise is definitely coming from here.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.200
I reach toward the glass to check inside.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.000
All of a sudden, it stops chiming.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.320
Silence descends, broken only by ticking.

24:04.440 --> 24:12.120
I guess it's fixed now, but that timing was a little too spot on. Was it really a coincidence?

24:12.120 --> 24:21.160
All these strange occurrences make me uneasy, but I continue on to the room with the light.

24:25.480 --> 24:29.720
Stopping in front of the door, I knock.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.600
But again, there's no reply.

24:43.080 --> 24:49.960
I try again several times, even calling out, but there's still no answer. I push on the door.

24:54.520 --> 24:58.040
It's dark inside. What's that on the ground?

25:02.440 --> 25:07.320
Strange, I definitely saw lights on in here when I was outside.

25:07.880 --> 25:13.640
Wafting through the room is an odd smell.

25:16.520 --> 25:22.200
It's sugary, like ripe fruit. The whole room is permeated with it.

25:23.640 --> 25:28.840
Some kind of aromatherapy, maybe? And a particularly pleasant smell, though.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.080
The aroma draws me further into the room.

25:37.320 --> 25:44.440
And the floor under my feet feels off. It's wet.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.560
It dawns on me that I'm smelling something else mixed with the sweet smell.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.440
Chat sometimes blocks the dialogue window. Can you adjust the game screen?

25:58.440 --> 26:01.400
Okie dokie.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.280
It doesn't look that great, but is this okay, Senpai?

26:22.440 --> 26:22.760
Good.

26:23.160 --> 26:34.600
Well, you didn't want to just hear the sound of my voice. You needed your subtitles so that you can go along with me.

26:34.600 --> 26:54.440
We need to practice reading for your USL classes, of course. Okie dokie.

26:55.240 --> 27:04.920
But, like, oh yeah, I clicked off the screen. I know this scent. This metallic tang.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.920
Lightning flashes, then catch a glimpse of something.

27:25.320 --> 27:30.840
The startling grotesque object stretches out across the floor beneath my feet.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.760
Something strange is there.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.800
What should we do? Stare at it?

27:46.200 --> 27:50.040
Should we stare at it? We're gonna stare.

27:50.200 --> 27:58.200
Alright. So bizarre that I can't stop staring.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.400
Blooming flowers are everywhere.

28:08.120 --> 28:13.080
They're bursting out of the woman's stomach. A blood-soaked body overwhelmed with them.

28:13.640 --> 28:20.600
I really hate the look of Lotus Pods. I absolutely hate the look of him.

28:24.040 --> 28:32.840
I wrench my gaze away, horrified. But the hellish image is burned into my mind. I can feel my entire body shaking.

28:32.840 --> 28:43.560
Bio-Rises. I'm gonna throw up. Haha, what's new?

29:02.840 --> 29:05.000
In the next instant, the lights are on.

29:10.200 --> 29:15.160
Wait, that's not all. The body is gone, leaving only a stain.

29:17.960 --> 29:25.880
This doesn't make sense. Bad dream, at least. I'd really, had really much preferred if it was

29:26.920 --> 29:32.280
the faint smell that remains in the blood-stained crush my any hope I had of it.

29:32.840 --> 29:40.520
I beat a retreat from the room in an effort to escape this whole bizarre situation.

29:49.080 --> 29:52.440
When I stumble back into the hall, the lights are on in here as well.

29:54.920 --> 30:00.040
I decide to have another look around. While the furnishing in here are old enough to be antiques,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.160
I match this old-fashioned mansion.

30:07.480 --> 30:12.040
A large doll sits on a couch. This must be the figure I saw in the dark.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.840
One would easily mistake this for a human if they couldn't see the ball joints.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.880
Probably belongs to the owner of the mansion.

30:22.520 --> 30:27.160
But what do I do now?

30:28.120 --> 30:29.160
Contact the police?

30:29.880 --> 30:33.320
Their stomach was full of flour, sir, and the corpse stopped and vanished like fog.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.320
Like anyone would believe that.

30:41.880 --> 30:46.520
Welcome. Welcome to Kujo Mansion.

30:52.520 --> 30:57.320
The doll moved and spoke.

31:00.360 --> 31:06.120
A different kind of shutter runs through me, and the one I found, the corpse.

31:07.560 --> 31:12.600
Up until this point, I was nothing more than an observer to all these freaky events.

31:12.600 --> 31:22.360
I could distance myself from it, but now a doll is talking to me.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.680
Have I startled you?

31:28.200 --> 31:31.400
If so, I sincerely apologize.

31:32.680 --> 31:38.360
My master ordered me to behave like a normal doll until told otherwise.

31:38.520 --> 31:45.400
The words are elegant and refined, but her face never moves an inch.

31:46.680 --> 31:49.320
She may look human, but she clearly isn't.

31:55.320 --> 31:59.320
She slowly folds her hands together, though she can move too.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.720
I'm sorry for not introducing myself.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.520
I'm called Mary.

32:08.120 --> 32:12.680
You have likely seen a number of oddities here already.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.160
I see my master, Zaya Kujo, was unable to escape from the mark then.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.920
Zaya Kujo, does she mean that corpse?

32:28.200 --> 32:30.120
But wait, what about this mark?

32:30.120 --> 32:31.720
What about this bell to mark?

32:33.880 --> 32:37.560
Lady Zaya was searching for a way to escape the mark.

32:39.720 --> 32:43.960
Were you not also called here by her because of the mark on your arm?

32:49.480 --> 32:51.560
She must be talking about this weird scar.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.480
Did Zaya Kujo invite me to this mansion?

32:57.560 --> 33:00.440
When I try to remember, my head hurts.

33:04.680 --> 33:08.280
I have something to tell you in place of my light master,

33:09.960 --> 33:12.840
but I would like to ask one thing first.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.520
Do you know your own name?

33:18.760 --> 33:21.720
Well, that was a much simpler question than I had been expecting.

33:22.760 --> 33:23.240
It's...

33:23.240 --> 33:33.400
I break out into a sweat.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.400
My throat is drying up.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.440
Why?

33:38.440 --> 33:39.560
Why can't I answer?

33:40.600 --> 33:42.680
I'm shocked to find I'm coming up blank.

33:44.200 --> 33:44.840
I see.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.400
Then it is as I thought.

33:48.040 --> 33:51.480
Somehow, Mary knows what's going on with me.

33:52.760 --> 33:59.160
Before I offer an explanation, please decide on a temporary name.

34:00.520 --> 34:05.400
Things will go much easier if I have a name I wish to call you.

34:07.720 --> 34:13.640
It is also likely you will find it hard to remain calm if you are nameless.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.920
She's probably right.

34:15.640 --> 34:23.000
Better to have some placeholder name than continue life as a hollow nameless being.

34:26.440 --> 34:30.040
Enter the protagonist's last name, up to 10 letters.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.160
Okay, delete.

34:43.800 --> 34:47.160
No, no, no, no, no.

34:49.640 --> 34:50.280
Last name.

34:52.200 --> 34:59.800
First name.

35:14.280 --> 35:23.800
Oops.

35:29.960 --> 35:35.800
We have to deduce formalities, of course.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.000
He's literally you, for real, for real.

35:41.000 --> 35:41.800
Senpai, Senpai.

35:43.800 --> 35:55.400
Can't it be Senpai Modest?

35:56.440 --> 35:58.600
No, I have to take your last name, Senpai.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.800
So it's Senpai Senpai.

36:08.200 --> 36:08.520
Yes.

36:10.680 --> 36:12.440
It's Senpai Senpai, okay.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.640
It cannot be changed.

36:25.320 --> 36:25.640
Yeah.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.200
Not Darling Senpai?

36:30.840 --> 36:32.760
Well, then it would say Darling.

36:34.040 --> 36:39.160
Depending on the person, they'll say Darling-san, Senpai-san.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.040
I want to Senpai-san, Senpai-san.

36:42.840 --> 36:48.200
Okay.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.520
You okay with others calling you Senpai?

37:00.520 --> 37:01.080
Of course.

37:02.200 --> 37:05.320
Now, if they have a crush on you, on the other hand, that's different.

37:05.720 --> 37:13.320
After all, Senpai must be Senpai in every situation.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.080
Besides, if you die, that's just in character, isn't it?

37:30.040 --> 37:31.560
She berayed.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.800
Excuse me, I got to adjust myself.

37:39.640 --> 37:39.960
Okay.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.480
Welcome, Raiders.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.840
Welcome.

37:48.840 --> 37:54.840
Welcome my baby girl.

37:54.840 --> 38:00.600
She be cotton bomb.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.560
Welcome to the stream.

38:07.720 --> 38:08.520
Welcome, welcome.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.080
We are naming the protagonist right now.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.760
How was your stream?

38:13.480 --> 38:17.800
I totally forgot what you were playing because I was out all day.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.760
Gosh, I love my gen mate so much.

38:24.360 --> 38:28.280
But I can go back and be like, hold on.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.360
Fine, fine.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.800
You guys, you have variety now.

38:35.800 --> 38:36.120
Fine.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.880
I'll give you variety, Senpai.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.800
I went Dar-villor.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.040
V-Darling.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.040
Wow, that's going to be...

39:05.000 --> 39:07.720
When is someone going to start that up, huh?

39:14.600 --> 39:18.520
Chibis was fighting tamper vampires, now fighting Fa.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.200
Like the food, right?

39:23.080 --> 39:28.440
Oh, I spelled Senpai wrong.

39:28.440 --> 39:32.440
Do I even love Senpai if I spell Senpai's name wrong?

39:36.440 --> 39:37.320
Oh, fuck it.

39:43.320 --> 39:44.120
There we go.

39:45.080 --> 39:45.960
There we go.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.680
Senpai, darling.

39:54.680 --> 39:55.080
Okay?

40:04.840 --> 40:06.120
The dyslexia hitting.

40:06.680 --> 40:09.240
Oh, oh, we get to choose our luck.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.280
Senpai, you get to choose the luck.

40:12.520 --> 40:15.640
Look, do you want glasses and beard?

40:15.640 --> 40:16.360
Beard?

40:16.360 --> 40:17.400
Just glasses?

40:17.400 --> 40:17.800
Nothing?

40:23.160 --> 40:25.000
You want to wear glasses?

40:25.000 --> 40:26.360
You want to just have a beard?

40:30.840 --> 40:31.560
Just glasses?

40:31.560 --> 40:32.680
I just see glasses.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.680
Okay, glasses it is.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.080
It's this okay?

40:39.560 --> 40:44.120
Yeah, let's fucking go.

40:46.120 --> 40:46.600
I'm...

40:48.600 --> 40:49.080
Excuse me.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.480
I'm Senpai, darling.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.080
Understood, Lord Darling.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.880
Now, I shall explain to you about the mark.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.240
It is the Seal of Death.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.200
Those who have it will soon die.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.400
You do not believe me?

41:18.440 --> 41:21.960
I'm certain this sounds absurd to want to know.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.960
I'm sure it's the seal of death.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.960
I'm sure it's the seal of death.

41:26.520 --> 41:31.720
I'm certain this sounds absurd to want you as loved at an eventful life.

41:34.440 --> 41:39.000
However, my master's death proves it to be irrefutably true.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.000
The Carps?

41:45.000 --> 41:47.560
The Carp's sweet stench comes back to me.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.160
It didn't seem like the work of humans.

41:51.880 --> 41:59.480
I'm afraid that the horror of the mark does not stop there.

42:02.280 --> 42:05.960
Victims slowly lose their memories until the day they die.

42:07.080 --> 42:12.840
They face death all the while suffering from the terror of losing oneself.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.440
Memory loss?

42:21.880 --> 42:23.080
I can't be that.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.360
That would mean that I'm...

42:26.120 --> 42:26.520
Yes.

42:27.400 --> 42:32.680
The fact that you have forgotten your name proves that death is coming.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.640
Lord Darling, you...

42:41.640 --> 42:43.080
...will die this very dawn.

42:46.120 --> 42:46.760
Death mark.

42:51.400 --> 43:01.160
Yes, I think I named the protagonist aptly.

43:02.280 --> 43:06.760
Remember, senpai, your mortality is always finite.

43:16.840 --> 43:19.480
My memories skip forward a bit after that.

43:20.440 --> 43:25.160
I just remember being completely stunned at what Mary revealed to me.

43:30.280 --> 43:34.760
I can probably attribute it to memory loss caused by the mark.

43:38.040 --> 43:39.240
The next thing I know...

43:43.560 --> 43:45.640
...I'm lying in a guest room in the mansion.

43:45.640 --> 43:51.400
I vaguely recall dragging myself up the stairs and coming here.

43:56.760 --> 44:00.680
I must have fallen asleep at some point, and thanks to that I feel a lot better.

44:02.920 --> 44:04.120
I'll die at dawn, huh?

44:06.840 --> 44:08.280
I try saying it out loud.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.080
It's definitely shocking, but I can't say it feels real yet.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.120
It doesn't make sense, way out of the blue.

44:16.760 --> 44:22.280
But if it's true, is waiting for my untimely death the only thing I can do?

44:26.520 --> 44:28.920
It might be a good idea to ask Mary more about it.

44:36.680 --> 44:40.520
I find Mary sitting in the exact same spot as before.

44:41.240 --> 44:42.520
She hasn't moved an inch.

44:43.800 --> 44:49.000
I doubt a doll gets bored waiting like humans do.

44:52.840 --> 44:53.480
Good morning.

44:56.040 --> 44:58.360
Good morning, Lord, darling.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.600
Maybe we should save before I do something crazy?

45:04.040 --> 45:06.120
Is there a save option?

45:06.520 --> 45:14.200
Are you... are you feeling better now?

45:17.800 --> 45:19.800
Well, how do you feel, Senpai?

45:26.520 --> 45:27.880
Yeah, you're fine.

45:27.880 --> 45:29.800
Fine, Senpai, you're all fine.

45:32.440 --> 45:32.920
Sort of?

45:33.880 --> 45:36.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, I see more yeses.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.280
That's good to hear.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.720
Yeah, I'm gonna adjust my voice for her, give me a second.

45:47.160 --> 45:51.800
Since it appears that you have calmed down, I would like to ask you a question.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.680
Okay, yeah, I think this is better.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.440
What do you guys think?

45:57.960 --> 45:58.840
What does Senpai think?

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
Yeah, I'm gonna go up here.

46:05.640 --> 46:06.760
What will you do now?

46:10.040 --> 46:12.920
I can guide you down only two paths.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.040
The first is to wait for death.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.320
The second is to fight the mark.

46:20.920 --> 46:22.600
Can... can you help me?

46:24.280 --> 46:26.360
If that is what you wish, yes.

46:29.080 --> 46:32.200
My master was researching the mark.

46:33.160 --> 46:37.240
A few days prior to her death, he found a way to escape it.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.720
Regretfully, she passed away before she was able to inform me.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.720
So she doesn't know anything after all.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.560
There is some time yet before dawn.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.360
You have a slim chance.

46:55.160 --> 46:58.760
Salvation is a thin thread dangling from heaven.

47:00.120 --> 47:04.520
Would you put that you would grab hold of?

47:05.320 --> 47:07.560
And I shall do my utmost to help.

47:10.520 --> 47:11.400
What will you do?

47:14.600 --> 47:17.480
I guess this boils down to whether I trust her.

47:18.440 --> 47:23.000
If she's right about all this, my time on earth is up at dawn.

47:23.880 --> 47:27.720
If I don't want to die, then there's no other choice but to resist the mark until then.

47:28.840 --> 47:31.240
If she's lying, I'll be fine when the morning comes.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.800
And am I really alright with that?

47:36.120 --> 47:37.720
Aw, I got blinded.

47:40.040 --> 47:43.880
People are being killed in nonsensical, grotesque ways.

47:44.680 --> 47:46.840
Am I going to turn a blind eye to it?

47:53.000 --> 47:54.440
This is a life or death decision.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.600
I need to think about it carefully.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.400
Live or die.

48:09.640 --> 48:10.360
Deadly choice.

48:12.040 --> 48:15.080
You will be faced with choices that can result in death.

48:15.880 --> 48:18.680
It is limited time and your soul power will continue to drain.

48:18.920 --> 48:23.640
Time's up or wrong answers will result in a game over.

48:24.360 --> 48:27.960
So be quick, but also careful in finding the right answers.

48:30.680 --> 48:32.040
Restoring soul power.

48:32.920 --> 48:36.600
Completing a deadly choice will restore some soul power.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.480
Accelerated dialogue.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.000
Dialogue will be sped up while pressing the left button.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.200
But certain dialogue cannot be sped up.

48:46.760 --> 48:47.400
Backlog.

48:47.960 --> 48:51.320
Start with display previous dialogue.

48:52.680 --> 48:53.320
Auto mode.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.800
The right button will activate auto mode.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.080
Hiding the dialogue window.

48:59.640 --> 49:02.120
You can hide the dialogue window by pressing Y.

49:07.320 --> 49:13.640
Then I shall ask you, will you quietly wait for death or struggle against the mark?

49:16.360 --> 49:20.360
We're going to fight the mark, obviously.

49:25.240 --> 49:25.740
Safe.

49:31.080 --> 49:31.800
Survived.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.040
I've decided to trust you.

49:42.600 --> 49:46.120
As you say, Lord Diving.

49:48.040 --> 49:52.440
Then I shall carry out the dying wish of my master and aid you.

49:54.040 --> 49:57.800
I cannot do much, but feel free to request anything you wish of me.

50:05.240 --> 50:08.040
I made up my mind, but that doesn't mean I know what I should do.

50:08.840 --> 50:13.000
And I'll squat about the supernatural and losing my memory makes research impossible.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.160
I don't have a moment to lose.

50:18.120 --> 50:19.560
A knock comes from the front door.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.560
It would come here this late at night.

50:23.960 --> 50:26.520
Oh my, what a sign of fate.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.960
It seems the other markbearers have arrived.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.440
Is it instinct that she knows these things?

50:35.400 --> 50:39.480
Maybe she has some kind of mysterious power being a talking doll and all.

50:41.320 --> 50:43.560
I beg your pardon, Lord Diving.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.280
I do apologize.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.320
But could you go greet our guests in my stead?

50:51.480 --> 50:55.720
They may experience a shock of a doll such as myself welcomes them.

50:56.680 --> 51:00.680
Moreover, while I'm able to move my arms, I am unable to walk.

51:05.400 --> 51:07.800
I move to the front door to greet our guests.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.400
People fated to die like me.

51:12.360 --> 51:13.400
I wonder what they're like.

51:18.840 --> 51:23.480
Who I find at the door are not who I expect to see this late at night.

51:25.720 --> 51:30.840
A high schooler and a small boy.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.480
These kids have the mark?

51:33.880 --> 51:34.440
No way.

51:40.280 --> 51:45.960
Um, we came to see Professor Kujo.

51:47.160 --> 51:47.800
Who are you?

51:49.640 --> 51:52.760
I can't say I'm a total stranger since I'm here at the mansion.

51:54.360 --> 51:54.600
I'm...

51:58.120 --> 51:58.360
So...

52:01.240 --> 52:01.960
What do you want?

52:04.120 --> 52:04.920
Sampai?

52:06.520 --> 52:07.160
What do you want?

52:08.440 --> 52:09.160
Do you want to be...

52:13.320 --> 52:14.120
her relative?

52:15.240 --> 52:16.040
Her disciple?

52:18.760 --> 52:20.200
Her relative or disciple?

52:26.440 --> 52:27.160
No!

52:27.160 --> 52:29.480
Boyfriend is not an option!

52:30.440 --> 52:31.720
Boyfriend is not an option!

52:31.720 --> 52:32.520
No option!

52:34.120 --> 52:34.920
You're mine!

52:34.920 --> 52:35.560
Mine!

52:44.520 --> 52:46.120
Sampai's cheating on me.

52:59.480 --> 53:02.760
You're not going to make me cry, right?

53:05.880 --> 53:07.960
Okay, let's go with relative.

53:23.880 --> 53:24.520
Oh.

53:24.600 --> 53:26.760
So, you're her older brother.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.400
Your eyes do kind...

53:30.280 --> 53:32.440
Do look kind similar.

53:32.440 --> 53:35.320
Sorry, I've decided to go on with a different voice for her already.

53:37.320 --> 53:39.000
She seems to know Saiyaku-jou.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.840
I think about it, that business card did say Spirit Healer.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.640
Going off this girl's acceptance.

53:49.640 --> 53:52.280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

53:53.240 --> 53:56.840
Going off this girl's accessories, I get the feeling she's a huge occult fan.

53:59.880 --> 54:01.400
I'm Moe Watanabe.

54:02.360 --> 54:05.000
I'm here to talk to her about this article she wrote in no...

54:06.680 --> 54:07.960
Oop! Oop! Arts!

54:08.600 --> 54:09.080
Monthly!

54:11.800 --> 54:14.120
She pulls out an occult magazine out of her bag.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.560
Inside is a picture of the mark.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.040
Accompanying articles as the scar is.

54:27.720 --> 54:33.000
A soul-inhibiting disease that erases memories inquire at Kujo Mansion.

54:35.720 --> 54:39.480
Um, this is the same scar, right?

54:42.520 --> 54:46.440
Moe ellipses her skirt up a bit to show me her leg.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.280
Don't look, Senpai!

54:49.000 --> 54:52.200
Right there on her right thigh is the mark.

54:54.120 --> 54:58.280
I think I know what the article means by erasing memories.

55:00.600 --> 55:02.680
I've been super forgetful lately.

55:02.680 --> 55:04.600
I'm even blanking on my friend's names.

55:07.480 --> 55:09.240
That's never happened to me before.

55:12.040 --> 55:13.560
Do you think the scar is doing it?

55:14.280 --> 55:18.280
This article is obviously bogus.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.320
The young boy scoffs.

55:22.440 --> 55:25.960
Even kids know better than to believe in ghosts or curses these days.

55:38.120 --> 55:39.800
And a high schooler fell for it.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.240
You must be embarrassed about this.

55:41.960 --> 55:47.800
But Tsukasa, where did you hang around in the front of the Williams Mansion's key?

55:48.680 --> 55:50.360
Biss up, your scar scares you.

55:53.800 --> 55:56.280
Tsukasa seems to have no retort for that.

55:57.160 --> 55:58.440
He silently soaks.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.200
Looks like a bullseye.

56:04.840 --> 56:06.760
It's clear they're both mark-bearers.

56:07.880 --> 56:09.400
Better bring them over to meet Mary.

56:11.400 --> 56:15.880
Moe shrieks excitingly as she gets close.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.920
Oh my god, it's so cute!

56:19.640 --> 56:20.760
It's a doll, yeah?

56:20.760 --> 56:22.360
I've never seen one this big before.

56:26.680 --> 56:28.920
The craftsmanship is so detailed.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.360
It's almost like it's alive.

56:31.560 --> 56:32.920
They're both admiring her one.

56:35.160 --> 56:37.160
Welcome to Kujo Mansion.

56:38.680 --> 56:39.560
What?

56:39.560 --> 56:40.200
It's Spock.

56:41.480 --> 56:46.760
With that, the two new visitors join our numbers.

56:46.760 --> 56:48.440
They enter this monstrous world.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.400
That hover on the precipice of death.

56:55.400 --> 57:00.440
Mary tells Moe and Tsukasa about the mark once they regain their composure.

57:02.920 --> 57:06.600
All about the steady memory loss and their imminent death.

57:07.560 --> 57:12.600
It sounds like a ridiculous story, but it gains validity coming from someone like her.

57:16.760 --> 57:18.200
Both of their faces pale.

57:20.040 --> 57:26.600
Now, if you came specifically here because you believe that Lady Sia's article.

57:27.320 --> 57:38.600
You must have already experienced the pain of losing your memories.

57:41.560 --> 57:45.400
Moe admitted as much earlier, but I can see Tsukasa's face darken.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.960
So it must be happening to him too.

57:49.880 --> 57:51.320
Oh, what kind of tea today?

57:51.960 --> 58:00.360
I for gore, give me a second as I regain my memory.

58:07.320 --> 58:09.640
I for gore, maybe I have a death mark too.

58:21.960 --> 58:30.360
The funny thing is that I specifically picked out this tea

58:32.280 --> 58:37.480
because I knew Senpai's would ask, but then I forgot.

58:38.680 --> 58:39.480
Give me a second.

58:43.400 --> 58:45.240
Ah, okay.

58:45.240 --> 58:45.800
I remember.

58:45.800 --> 58:46.840
I remember now.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.320
I remember.

58:49.160 --> 58:50.040
It's Tulsi.

58:50.600 --> 58:51.640
Tulsi Ginger.

58:58.280 --> 58:59.240
Tulsi.

59:03.880 --> 59:06.600
I was just about to google the tea brand and be like,

59:06.600 --> 59:10.920
maybe if I look at the labels, I would remember.

59:10.920 --> 59:20.040
Is it any good?

59:20.040 --> 59:20.920
And yeah, I think so.

59:20.920 --> 59:25.640
It's got kind of like a mellow or earthy taste.

59:29.160 --> 59:29.880
Tulsi.

59:29.880 --> 59:31.640
T-U-L-S-I.

59:35.640 --> 59:38.680
Like, there's a VTuber with that name.

59:41.320 --> 59:50.360
There's a VTuber with that name.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.520
I think she's with Sony.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.960
I would repeat a meme that went around.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.040
About her.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.160
Or a viral tweet that went around about her.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:20.120
But that might not be safe for YouTube.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.440
She's on the JP side.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.840
I know, I know, I know.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.720
I know Senpai.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:51.480
I will give you a hint.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.800
I'll give you a hint.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.160
Someone mistook

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:19.080
15, 15, 15 men, meaning years, and translated to 15,

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.760
about 15,000.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:27.720
I think 15,000 men, so men being year, to 15,000 men.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.880
So I'll let your imagination go wild with that.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:02:01.080
I actually watched her debut and everyone was trolling her.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.360
Of course, Sony did a cease and desist on that.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:11.880
So you'll have to just do, well, what did they, what do you guys say?

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.200
Do your reps?

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:20.280
Yeah, you have to do your reps.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.080
Also, yeah, this week's homework.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:46.360
It's hard to catch up with the lingo that lots of people use.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:54.920
I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting a like crash course on like what, what some things mean.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.280
So yeah,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.480
that was, that was really fun.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.160
Actually, I hear she's a very nice person.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.800
So yeah, I really do like her design though.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.960
If you're, if you're a fan of,

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:32.120
um, canoes, canoes, like, like, uh, I see, or Emmy, you might like her design.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.840
It must be happening to him too.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:51.960
I'm going to scoot in closer.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.120
I was totally the wrong voice.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:00.520
Okay, okay.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.960
The peachy kind of light color.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.760
Why do I call them canoes?

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.960
Canoe.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.960
I'm making things up.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:49.000
But I'm talking about, you know, the little, little canoes.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:59.960
You know, the boat, you paddle.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:15.080
Hey, Moe, I'd like to confirm something.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.000
Where were you when you got the mark?

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.520
Amnesia seems to be worse than theirs.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.480
They might remember.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.120
The canoes need correction, right?

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.960
Yeah, they need to be corrected

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:53.080
so that they can, you know, float correctly.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:07.160
They might, so they might remember.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.120
I'm not positive, but

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:23.080
I think my mark might have been a curse from Hana Hiko.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.600
Hana Hiko.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:39.080
Thank you, Senpai.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.280
Beto the snippet.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:47.240
Mercy is the only person who is entirely charm points

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.480
and we're all lucky to be her Senpai.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.840
Oh, thank you.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.080
You are all lucky.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:06.840
But thank you, Senpai, for the 420.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.080
This name is familiar to me.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.800
He's the ghost of the resident children of this town whisper about, right?

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.800
Oh, sorry, it's correct.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.760
My master was interested in him.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:36.440
So Sayakujo was interested, was curious too, could be connected to the mark some day.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.440
I'd like to hear more about this ghost.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.440
As you wish, Lord Darling.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.440
And I shall tell you the rumors of Hana Hiko.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:57.880
Chapter one.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.520
Hana Hiko.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.400
Sorry, I need to do a cuter laugh, right?

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.560
Oh, did you hear?

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.160
Oops, that was my controller.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:19.160
About the ghost boy, all the schools in H City are talking about.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.480
Sounds like Hana Hiko is back.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:35.880
I heard he can appear if you peek in the school mirror at night or ask you something.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.560
Am I pretty?

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.120
If you tell him no, you'll be fine, but you say yes.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.920
I need that red stuff, then.

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.480
It just disappears.

01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:59.480
But that's not all.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.480
Hana Hiko hates adults, you know.

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.440
I heard that if the person he asks is an adult, they'll die.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.840
They'll not just drop dead.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.840
Blood is drained from them.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.320
And next to the carts is a single rose.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.760
Arrows dripping with blood.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.120
Remakes can be easily manipulated, passing from one person to another.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.160
Assumptions and errors mix in, but they also hold a hint of truth.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.280
Miss Moe, do you know anything else?

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:58.520
I probably cut my mark when I was investigating Hana Hiko at each elementary school.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.040
That's got to be some sort of clue.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.040
I should ask her more about it.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.040
Why were you at H Elementary?

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.320
My big dream is to write about the cult.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.520
I'd love to see a ghost.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.920
I found this article in a magazine mentioning Hana Hiko was seen there.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.600
I figured that place would be easier to sneak in than a regular school,

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.440
since it's been closed down.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.920
What should I ask next?

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.680
Was Hana Hiko there?

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.200
I don't think so, but I can't really say for sure.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.720
I went to the mirror, but a shipper suddenly ran down my spine and I got spooked and left.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.040
What should I ask next?

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.960
When did you notice the mark?

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.280
I noticed it later in the bath.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.320
A strange scar was suddenly on my thigh.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.360
It really surprised me.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.760
I realized immediately it had to be what Professor Kujo wrote about.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.000
Fellow high-patch haver, I have an iPad in real life.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.600
Twinsies!

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.360
You know, when I think, I think I recall.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.120
Is this a spoiler?

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.280
But I did guess this before I played the game.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:27.720
Well, no, when I first played the game, I think I guessed that the red stuff is like lipstick or something.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.800
Rouge, perhaps?

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.800
Perhaps Rouge?

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.920
I don't know what kind of makeup.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.480
They had in Japan, really.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.400
I think I have a handle on what happened.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.520
No way to know for sure about the ghost, but if there's no denying,

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.720
she had the mark after returning home from age elementary.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.400
And then, maybe, Tsukasa glanced down at his left hand.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.520
The line might be from behind a Hiko tooth.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.280
I noticed it after I got home from tea elementary.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.720
That ghost was seen a lot in schools in each city, right?

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.160
Maybe he remembered something, but I asked him some questions too.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:28.920
Tea elementary?

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.080
Got a school there.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.520
You've probably heard of it since it's a top ranked elementary in each city.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.520
What should I ask next?

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:39.880
When was that?

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.960
A year-round sunset?

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.560
I was heading home until I realized I forgot something and turned back.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.400
Should I ask Mips and just see Hena Hiko?

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.840
No, and I didn't get chills or anything either.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.160
Oh, but I think I passed a mirror.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.720
I went to the bathroom before going home.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.200
I don't think he knows anymore.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.480
Stories are pretty similar to the Hena Hiko rooms.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.360
They can't just be coins in this.

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.600
You must invest to eat the places for Hena Hiko up here.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:18.040
For their sake, as well as yours.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.040
Ah, well, that sounds all well and good, but...

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.920
What exactly am I investigating?

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.200
Death and life coexistence.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.240
The mark originated there, and a way to erase it will also be there.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.240
Did I get breathier for her voice?

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.480
Oh my goodness, I can't keep track of the voices I'm making for each character.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.840
I must be so tired some pie.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.240
I must be so tired.

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.120
No, that was totally not the voice I did.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.120
I did like a really creepy voice, huh?

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:06.760
My bad.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.400
You must find it.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.440
Break the key.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.440
You need to break the mark's curse.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.640
Wait, find the key, and then I'll make the...

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.760
Oh my gosh, oh.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:25.720
Maybe doing a visual novel for my last day of my debut week was definitely...

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:33.080
It was definitely a little bit short-sighted on my side.

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.680
That is the only way to escape.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.040
And all of a sudden, a huge burden was dropped on my shoulders.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.840
We can go back to Harvester?

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.560
No, no, no.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:00.920
If I pick something, we're playing that today unless it's like completely terrible.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:16.200
But I will add Harvester back onto the schedule.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.200
Probably the week after.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.400
It seems...

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.120
It seems that Hanahiko appeared at two schools.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.040
Where will you investigate?

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.040
Okay, okay.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.080
Logic time.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.760
Logic time, Senpai.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.880
We're probably going to go to H Elementary instead of T Elementary,

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:48.440
because T Elementary is most likely severely guarded since it's a prestigious school,

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.480
and H Elementary might not be as guarded.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.640
Are we still doing Markiller 7 as well?

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.120
Of course.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:11.480
Yeah, that's probably wise.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.240
I'd arrest you on the spot if you tried to sneak into a regular school.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.200
I told you!

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.000
I told you!

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.560
H Elementary might be a-ha-h-ha-aunted.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.520
Scared of a little security?

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.720
Yeah, just a little bit.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.040
A middle-aged man who can't recall his name,

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.440
let alone his address or job title.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.040
Would have no excuse if I got caught.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.760
Wanna get going then?

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.200
Let's do this!

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.880
Let's do this!

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.480
Wait, you're coming too?

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.320
Of course!

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.880
I haven't given up on seeing Hanahiko yet.

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:56.760
She grins at me.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.840
Is she really strong, or is this blind optimism?

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.960
I'm going too.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.160
Hey, not you two, seriously.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.720
My life's on the line here.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.120
I don't want the reason I die to be,

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.800
because you messed up something.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.920
You messed something up.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.800
Oh, dang!

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.080
This kid has no just on me and me, and they'll be right!

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.200
That's pretty bold.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.160
Good thing you're cute.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.960
But to bring kids along with me is...

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.920
I understand your hesitation,

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.960
but the mark does not discriminate,

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.960
stealing lives of children and adults.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.120
They wish to fight their fate.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.560
We should honor that.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.800
I suppose human logic doesn't fly

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.400
when dealing with the supernatural.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.560
We'll need to prepare ourselves

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.160
for the worst if we're gonna survive.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.400
Please take only one mark bearer with you, however.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.680
A large group will increase the odds

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.360
of you being detected by spirits.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.520
I also ask that you not waste time

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.040
dwindling with others on the way.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.280
It is possible.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.160
Unnecessary contact may hasten the effect of the mark.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.680
Only engage when absolutely necessary.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:29.160
Keep contact with others to a minimum.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.840
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna say.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.280
Have a safe trip.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:41.880
Okay, we are not bringing the tiny child.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.880
Selecting a partner.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.200
First, select a mark bearer.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.480
Do this in partner menu.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.320
Oh, yeah!

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.120
Hey, mister!

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.280
How do you think it'll be a good idea

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.360
to take notes on what Mary's told us?

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.000
Your memory's getting worse all the time.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.280
We don't want to forget anything.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:06.920
I don't know when I'll lose my memory again.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.320
All right, down all the information I get

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.360
and keep it in my file.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.800
Something in it might just save our lives at some point.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.040
New info was added to the spirit file

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.960
rumor of Hanna Hiko other.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.440
Spirit file.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.880
Important info on spirits will be added

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.920
to the spirit file.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.640
Check it from your bag.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.240
Consult it if you need help.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.120
Saving and loading.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.560
Save at the mansion or hunts.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.360
Return to the title screen from the bag

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.280
to live for your luck to load.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.400
Then choose continue.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.560
Wait, X to save.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.520
Ho, ho, ho!

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.200
Look, we finally got the save.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.040
Partner.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.040
We are not taking the smart one.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.960
The smart mouth and child.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.880
I would want to leave this kid behind.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:03.880
We'll take, we'll take.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:05.960
I knew it!

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.120
I knew her voice was ganky.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.560
Did you hear that?

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.440
She's super ganky.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:18.920
Big.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.160
Okay, Hanna Hiko.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.760
Okay, that's not all.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.640
Kujo mansion.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.560
Yes, adults.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.360
It hates adults.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.280
Okay, the red stuff.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.680
Okay, and.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:40.920
Not that.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:43.720
Exit.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.840
First, first we have to get to H elementary.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.400
Am I pretty ganky?

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.440
Ganky Senpai.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.480
I feel like I'm pretty ganky, but.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:05.000
But I, I also maybe not.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.480
I'm maybe not the most gankiest.

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:09.880
Super ganky.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.120
Mary says we're free to use the car in the garage.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.600
The garage is attached from the mansion.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.680
The vintage model van in bicycles only sent the elegant interior.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.000
Thank God for careless people.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
The car key was left in the table.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:34.520
Time to go.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:36.760
Uh, hey.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.280
According to Mary, you lost a bunch of your memories, right?

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.400
Is it okay for you to drive?

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.200
She looks at me suspiciously.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.000
Don't worry, it'll be fine, I think.

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.280
I'll come back when I take the wheel.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.920
Part of that is to convince myself.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.200
Well, aren't you missing your license?

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:07.880
If a cop finds us, we'll have more to worry about than Hanahiko.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.520
She's right about that.

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.800
But I have a license.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.840
But this is not me, this is Senpai.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.000
Senpai, do you have a license?

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.680
But our lives are on the line, so we don't have much of a choice.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:35.240
Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:42.600
Then we're safe if, if more than, if a good, if a handful of Senpais can drive, will survive.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.000
Once the mark's gone, I'll remember.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.640
I'm surprised that a lot of you don't have a driver's license, actually.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:12.440
Then I'll probably just have them reissue it, assuming I ever got one.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.200
Oh, now I'm even more worried.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.360
Just drive safe, okay?

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.160
Let's head to H. elementary.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.160
Hoteru.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.080
Human bodies are remarkable.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.880
Back in the garage, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to drive or not.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.880
But the second my hand touched the wheel, I wasn't worried anymore.

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.880
I must have reacted quicker than I expected.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:58.760
And now, it's now easy to guide this monster down the road.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:06.840
Now, thoughts of what I can no longer do start to filter in my head.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.080
Hey, mister.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.440
Moe pipes up hesitantly.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.720
I should have put more.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.200
I put too much ganky in that.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.920
I'd probably let the silence go on too long.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:28.440
It doesn't seem as cheerful as she was a little while ago.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.680
What's it like to lose your memories?

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.360
That's a hard question to answer.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.160
What do you mean?

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.560
Like, do they all go at once?

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.240
Or a few pieces at a time?

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:04.520
I can't believe I'm just like, just like, hey, mister.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.920
She said, hesitantly, hey, mister.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:09.800
Tea.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.000
What if you're only left with sad memories?

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.360
I'd hate that.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:30.040
I don't think it works like that, but I have no idea if it's getting worse or better.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.040
I don't know what I was like to begin with, so there's nothing to compare to.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.280
In that sense, rather than the memories vanishing,

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.720
like everything's been painted white, but it feels like.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.640
Oh, you sure I'm mature, mister?

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.960
Take everything so calmly.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.240
No, no, no, no, no, no, senpais do not paint it white.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.680
We are facing.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.720
We are facing some ghosts right now.

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:24.200
The conversation dwindles, leaving only the sound of the tires on the road.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.920
Then thoughts start popping into my head again, one after another.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.240
I know we have to check out that mirror.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.680
What else should we investigate?

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.320
What do you think?

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.880
The white glance is over it.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:43.880
No idea.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.320
I can't even remember my own name.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.240
How the hell am I supposed to know what we're doing?

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:55.960
Oh, please.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.240
I'm really counting on you.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.400
Think about everything.

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.600
I'm talking to a child.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:07.000
I need to show restraint and be a good example.

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.680
But that's definitely how I really feel.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.560
Mercy, this girl is kind of clingy.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.080
She's just a kid.

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.920
I'm pretty clingy.

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.920
Do you have problems with that, senpai?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.520
I stare down the steering wheel.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.000
Ah, flashbang.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.320
No, no problem.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.680
Not only Mercy, it's okay.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.280
Also, your coral if it's a kid, gotcha.

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.080
What are you implying, senpai?

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:05.080
I'm saying that you would not have any interest in kids, right?

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:06.680
Senpai?

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.640
Amy and Icy don't count.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.240
They don't count.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.400
No, they don't count.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.680
No, they don't count.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.640
Amy is immortal, and I don't know how old Icy is in bear,

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:56.760
but bear, but old enough in human years.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:28:59.000
Okay.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:08.200
You're not interested in high schoolers, right, senpai?

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.680
Except for me, right?

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:14.040
An adult who's sort of role-playing a high schooler.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.920
I know I'm a college.

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:30.920
I'm college.

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:32.920
Wait, I'm college.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.480
I'm college.

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:34.440
I made a mistake.

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.600
I just like high school uniforms.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:52.920
Listen, they don't wear sayfuku in university.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.760
This is just aesthetics.

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:04.120
This is just aesthetics.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.520
This is just aesthetics.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:07.400
Shut the fuck up.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.400
Memory loss beam.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:18.920
You will forget that I made a fucking lucky boo.

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.280
Let's continue the game.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:31.080
Yeah.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:37.800
Who's that doll here?

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:41.400
Oh, yeah, let's do the game.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.120
A doll in the mansion.

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.000
Markbearers.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:05.800
Yo, senpai, you forgot.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.600
You dozed off a little.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.280
We're playing death mark, remember?

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.120
The mark spirits.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.520
And the mysterious deaths.

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:37.560
Can't remember, must be the mark.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.480
Oh, no, we should go exercise these spirits.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:45.640
Yeah, it's okay.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.720
It's okay if senpai is passed out.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.560
I'm always taking care of senpai.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.600
Also, yeah, senpai has been in a loving relationship with me for a long time,

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.200
and we're going to have three kids, okay?

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.880
Feel like I'm going to be buried

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.680
under all the crushing thoughts that keep popping into my mind.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.480
I think three is a good number.

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.400
I think three per senpai is a good number.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:40.120
What awaits me down the dark road?

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.200
I actually, to be honest, I don't know.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:51.640
What I'm saying?

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.360
I think actually three kids in total is fine.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:08.280
Okay, yeah, it's been a long week.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.440
I've been, I've been just saying shit.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:25.640
I feel a flutter, flutter, flutter, and mark on my wrist like it's trying to warn me.

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:34.440
My brain might not be able to understand, but my body can sense it.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.240
That death is closing in.

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.040
You want daughters or son more?

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:45.000
Um, I don't know.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.920
I feel like daughters are cuter,

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.280
but like, I wouldn't mind a son either.

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.680
Anyways, it doesn't matter.

01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.120
I'll love them no matter what.

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.920
If that's happening, isn't the problem.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.560
It's more how long do I have left?

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.080
How much, how much longer is it?

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:19.640
I almost yell, but I managed to swallow it down with effort.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.960
I think we're almost there.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:33.480
Even if our kids are worms, even if you are a worm, Senpai, I would still love you.

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:39.880
Really?

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.280
Really?

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.400
It's closer than I thought.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.800
Yeah, yeah, exactly right.

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.360
Or at any time it could

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:56.040
It's a lot closer than you think.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:10.280
Looming ominously in the moonlight, the school definitely looks abandoned.

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.920
For quite a number of years, in fact, these walls are starting to crack.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.400
All the windows are broken as well.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:21.960
A thick chain is in front of the main gate to keep people from going in.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.120
Hey, you there, not another step.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:33.960
An enthusiastic voice comes from a man in a guard uniform.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.560
You must be patrolling the area like we got caught.

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.720
This property belongs to the city.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.480
No one's allowed in, didn't you know?

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:46.680
Or are you up to something?

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.160
A bunch of people have been coming here on dares since it's haunted.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.160
You aren't one of them, are you?

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:57.640
It's haunted?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:35:59.880
Oh, give me a second.

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.400
Um, it's haunted?

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.000
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.040
Damn, is it haunted?

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.160
Oh, that's what the rumors are saying anyway.

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.040
It's just a great pain.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:14.840
Oh, he nods in agreement.

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.600
It is pretty famous after all.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:20.680
The guard sighs.

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.080
Anyway, the school is off limits, so you can't go inside.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.680
I don't want any trouble on my first shift here.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.240
Please leave.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:33.800
You know.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:34.680
Okay.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.240
You know.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.840
I'm muttering to himself.

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.680
The guard makes his way into the school.

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.480
As we watch him leave, Moe leans over and whispers.

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.480
Damn, it wasn't a guard when I stuck in here before.

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:55.480
I did not get caught.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.960
Moving around a haunt.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.320
Use the...

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.040
Lease keys to move.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.640
The map shows which way you're facing and where you can go.

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:10.280
All right.

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:13.720
Let's go.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:15.900
Oh.

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.240
Pushing open the doors I head inside.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.840
Oh, it's so dark.

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.160
I can't see anything like this.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.200
The moonlight doesn't reach inside.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.720
We'll have to use the flashlight.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.880
But if we use the flashlight, that guard will find us.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.760
And do anything about it, I guess.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:38.680
Anyway, that mirror is...

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.280
I'm pretty sure it's on the right.

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.280
To the right on the staircase.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:45.980
Okay.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.120
Instagating a haunt.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.840
Move the L to search the current area.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.800
Shine the flashlight in areas of interest and press A.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.680
Pressing B ends the search.

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:00.920
Using the pad.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.640
The search and move.

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.520
Um, look.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:17.480
Do not leave hand prints in the mirror in the eastern staircase.

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:17.880
Thank you.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.360
Independent research presentation.

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.160
First floor.

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.280
Multi-purpose classroom.

01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.000
Come check it out.

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.960
Wow, that presentation takes me back.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.520
Anyway, the mirror is on the eastern staircase.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:31.320
It's the one I saw.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.360
Guess we'll go there first.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:36.360
Yeah, it's to the right.

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.840
Let me investigate, bish.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.200
Yo, I turn over the torn flyer.

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:45.640
And I don't find anything in particular.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.680
Nothing's there, huh?

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:51.880
Nothing's there, huh?

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:52.520
Looks like it.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:55.180
Cool.

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.280
Um, and...

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:03.560
Anything else?

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:03.880
Ooh!

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:10.360
There are platforms of broken wooden slats in front of this true rock.

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.200
They creak when we step on them.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:13.960
Record?

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:18.920
Uh...

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:23.640
Oh, that's one.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:25.960
Half torn poster.

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.280
Says lost and found in large letters at the top.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:33.000
Look, lost items are kept in the storage in the staff room.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.000
Please check if you're missing something.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:37.480
Deal.

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:39.000
Touch the paper.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:39.880
It disintegrates.

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:43.800
Second, my fingers reach it and scatters through the air.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.800
Nothing else looks interesting.

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:52.040
Okay, anything else we can look at?

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:57.480
The ceiling is filthy and the fluorescent lights are broken.

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:03.000
All right, I think that's it.

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.040
Went to the right.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.420
Huh?

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.200
As we enter the hallway, a small shadow flits across our feet.

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.800
Turn the flashlight and find.

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:22.680
Huh? A bunny!

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.480
It's so cute!

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:28.860
Huh.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.560
A bunny!

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:37.720
What's... is it the school pet?

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:41.320
Uh, how long has the school been closed for?

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.200
I don't think so.

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.360
I don't think so.

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.720
I don't think the banyoumi's there.

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.360
Chibi's more of a blonde bunny.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.560
Is the bunny from Ghost Stories?

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:55.720
Touch me.

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:56.520
Touch me harder.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:08.840
The black rabbit squeaks and runs away.

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.040
It rushes towards the eastern end of the school.

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.280
Ah, I ran away.

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.560
Is it telling us to follow?

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:19.320
Haha, you're right.

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.080
New info was added to the spirit file.

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:23.720
Black rabbit.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.920
Uh, spooky.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:32.360
It looks like something smashed the fluorescent lights.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.200
Their shadowed beyond repair.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.600
Should we go into the classroom?

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.480
I'm gonna do it.

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:52.600
Maybe we can find something cool.

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.080
It's abandoned desk.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.280
On desk is slightly rusty.

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.600
Turn the desk around and stick my hand inside.

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.040
Got a holy, holy hard hat.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.840
I doubt that's very useful.

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.120
I doubt that's very useful.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:13.560
You never know.

01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:17.400
The dust is thick on the ceiling.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:20.520
That just walking around causes a shower of particles.

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.760
I think that's it in this room.

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:29.640
I can't.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:42.440
Moved forward.

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:45.960
Down here.

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:47.560
Seems to be locked.

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:54.280
Broken window is letting in a piercingly cold wind.

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:01.560
The door is locked.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.080
Locked door.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.280
I wonder if we could wrench it open by sticking the letter opening into the hole.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.400
Give it a try, but it won't even fit inside.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.720
Wow, so uncool.

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:25.400
Put the fuck up!

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:32.200
The floor tile is upheeled off, leaving bare concrete.

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.760
I wonder if I can just peel around.

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:37.960
Keyhole isn't rusted over.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:39.240
If I had a key, I could open it.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.040
Okay.

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:50.040
What platform did you first play this on, Mercy?

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:50.840
Um...

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:53.720
PS4.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:55.800
I think.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.080
The fire door is rusted shut and won't move.

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:04.840
Hi.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:08.760
Shut the fuck up!

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.000
That's my job!

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.160
Climb the stairs.

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.200
Don't copy me stinking.

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:33.480
Stinking ghost.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.120
This is it.

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:42.840
The mirror I saw last time, I'm sure of it.

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:44.520
Huh?

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.520
Just then a dull pain runs through my wrists.

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.600
Like something is biting into my skin.

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:57.000
To distract myself from the pain.

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.240
I keep talking with Moe.

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.560
Certainly looks normal.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.320
Yeah, what should we do?

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.240
I feel like I should save.

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:27.160
I suddenly face the mirror, bringing my face up to it.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.840
Into its cloudy surface.

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.520
As expected, I can't make anything else.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.680
I see my own shadow reflected as a vague shadowy lump.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.240
Shadow sways in the mirror.

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.720
At least that's what I thought at first.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.800
I figured the shadow moved because I had.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.680
The next time the shadow moves, a cold shiver runs down my spine.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:58.520
That's not my shadow.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:02.760
Okay, okay, you remember the story of Hanahiko, right?

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:07.960
We say no, you're not pretty, and we are not an adult.

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.160
Some things in the mirror.

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:21.480
Sorry, I'm going to try to do a Moe.

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:25.800
Moe yelps and steps back.

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.440
That confirms I'm not hallucinating.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:31.640
There really is something in there.

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.440
Every muscle in my body locks.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.160
Try to look away, but I can't even close my eyes.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:39.400
Figure's mouth twists.

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.920
I don't know look, but I can't even close my eyes.

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:47.480
It opens his mouth.

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.880
An unvoiced pierces my ears.

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:55.000
Live or die.

01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.120
Hey, am I pretty?

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.480
No, no, right?

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.200
Yes, safe!

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:20.680
Only I had that red stuff.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:23.960
Can't see well.

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:25.400
You a grown-up?

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:27.880
No, no, I'm not a grown-up.

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:28.360
Uh-uh.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:33.960
I'm the tallest in my class.

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:45.640
Big people aren't allowed in school.

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:50.840
Suddenly the mirror cracks.

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:54.440
I'm just, I was just pretty tall.

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:58.680
Actually, oh no, no, no, I'm not going to tell the story.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.800
I'm not going to tell the story because my senpais will make fun of me.

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:08.520
Suddenly the mirror cracks.

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:13.640
Big crack now.

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:18.680
I can't see no more big people here.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:22.920
We would never.

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.200
Okay, so you know how I'm five, five, three in freedom units, right?

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:29.640
Okay, fine.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.520
I'll tell the story.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:41.480
So I stopped growing around fifth grade.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.640
And I was the tallest in my class.

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:50.280
And I was so happy.

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:53.400
And then the following year, everyone shot way past me.

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.040
And I was like, oh, okay.

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:09.240
A brief fleeting moment of glory.

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:10.760
I was, I was the tallest.

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:15.880
And then I was not immediately after.

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.920
All right, the figure disappears.

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:25.080
Survived.

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:26.460
Whew.

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.000
The scream echoes from the other side of the school.

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:33.960
Moe sinks to the floor.

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:38.200
The gasping panic disbelief for a while.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:39.160
I feel much the same.

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:41.480
What was that?

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.960
Probably an ahiqo.

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:48.760
I couldn't say it.

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.160
The words stuck in my throat.

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.000
My mouth is completely dry.

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:55.800
I can't believe this.

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:59.640
I, I thought I wanted to see a ghost.

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.960
But just see one that clearly.

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.840
I got a moment to feel that I was the tallest.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.520
Yeah, hydration check.

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:25.160
Thank you.

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:28.120
Wait, are you saying that to Moe?

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:32.600
Well, excuse me.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:33.720
What about mercy?

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:44.680
Moe seems to shake the encounter off and return to normal.

01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:48.120
An ahiqo's words swirl in my head.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:54.040
Our situation has done a complete reverse from where we were just a moment ago.

01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:57.080
I can't believe I was complaining about not knowing what to investigate.

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:01.720
Oh, anyway, scream.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:02.440
What was that?

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.560
A guard we met outside.

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:19.640
I'm going to let that pass.

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.520
For now, then bye.

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.560
I doubt there's anyone else here.

01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:26.840
You might have seen something.

01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:27.880
Wherever he is too.

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.880
Sounded like it came from far away.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.200
A ways down the hallway.

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.200
Be the other side of the school.

01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:37.160
Yeah, let's look for him.

01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:38.840
If he screamed like that.

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:41.000
Something might have happened to him.

01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:45.640
Right as I respond, hear someone whisper in my ear.

01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:49.960
A pair of eyes.

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:51.560
Hold on.

01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.720
A pair of eyes with red.

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:02.440
I look in the direction of the voice, but all I see is darkness.

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:04.200
Mystery?

01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:06.760
No, it's nothing.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:09.480
Let's go.

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.120
New info was added to the spirit file.

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.640
An ahiqo, the boy in the mirror.

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:25.000
Can I go up here?

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:28.520
Climbed the stairs.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.840
Climbed up the stairs to the second floor.

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:37.720
I guess something soft squished under my heel.

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:41.800
Could I pick up my foot and shine the light down?

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.640
Oh, that's a lot of snacks.

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:44.440
Snacks.

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:47.320
Snacks, snacks.

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:48.360
So many snacks.

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:51.080
Hallways covered with poisonous snakes.

01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:53.320
Come on, wait.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.080
Let's have something close to a streak upon seeing them.

01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.800
Eats and snakes!

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.320
Decided to go back to the landing.

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:09.320
Oh, let's go.

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:11.880
Went down the stairs.

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:19.560
I think we looked at these places.

01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.760
A bird breaks the silence.

01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:26.520
Like there's a crow or something outside.

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.680
Don't spook me now!

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.040
Oh, shut up.

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:54.600
It needs to be locked.

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:08.200
Lights on the ceilings are silent and dark without power.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:10.600
Entered the left room.

01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.280
I don't know what that fucking says.

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:20.440
There are nonsense scribbles on the blackboard.

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.360
There's a hole in the wall.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:29.160
Yeah, stick my arm in, but the hole gets narrow and further I go in and can't reach

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:29.720
what's inside.

01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:31.880
Tool.

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.080
Fire opener.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:37.400
Pick the lever opener in the hole and scrape out the item though, second side.

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:40.200
A worn out talisman.

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.880
And I pick up the worn out talisman.

01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:43.560
I feel warmth flow through me.

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:46.360
Oh, soul power.

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:50.040
A worn out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:54.280
Find a worn out talisman to restore your soul power.

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:58.760
The more soul power you have, the easier it will be to survive a deadly choice.

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:03.640
Got an achievement for that.

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:07.240
An abandoned desk.

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:11.000
Yo, stick my hand inside and feel around.

01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:12.920
A plastic bottle.

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:15.240
There's nothing in the bottle.

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:17.560
Oh, it might come in handy.

01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:21.640
Senpai, are you scared?

01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:33.560
I can't remember which way I'm going.

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:42.520
I hear a noise like something slamming against the door.

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.560
Is someone inside?

01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:49.640
And the flashlight at the door.

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.560
No, not the security guard.

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:00.120
Yeah.

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:07.480
I don't know where the door bursts open and something comes flying out.

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:13.960
Moe shrieks and falls down.

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:16.200
I recognize those clothes.

01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:20.200
Some kind of plant covers half his face.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.160
The part of his face we can see is twisted in anguish as he screams.

01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:27.560
No doubt about it, it's that guard.

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:29.720
How happened?

01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:33.320
They're eating my face!

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.520
It hurts.

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:39.560
What's going on?

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:42.120
Uh-uh.

01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:43.960
I'm sorry.

01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:44.440
I'm sorry.

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:44.920
I'm sorry.

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:45.400
I'm sorry.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:45.960
I'm sorry.

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:46.440
I'm sorry.

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:46.920
I'm sorry.

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:47.400
I'm sorry.

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:47.960
I'm sorry.

01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:48.440
I'm sorry.

01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:48.920
I'm sorry.

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:49.560
I'm sorry.

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:52.920
Moe sits on the floor, stunned into syllable.

01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:02.680
The guards only rushes towards the entrance.

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:06.600
And then silence falls once more.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.040
The only sound left is that of her shaky breathing.

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:24.760
Once we catch her breath, take Moe's hand and help them up.

01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:30.200
Her nerves have calmed some, but that definitely left an unsettling impression.

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:35.800
Something terrible lurks here.

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:36.680
Can't just sit around.

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.360
I felt like I was paralyzed.

01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:43.720
I'm okay now.

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.520
Mr. That Guy.

01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:49.960
I'm always stares at the door.

01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:54.680
I wonder if Anahiko did that.

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:02.840
And I don't know if you noticed, but I got the feeling someone was standing behind him.

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:06.600
There's really no good way to respond to that.

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:09.480
I let silence serve as my answer.

01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:12.040
What else could I do?

01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:17.800
No point in coming here for just going to stand here shaking.

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.040
Don't uncover the secret before it comes for us.

01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:24.680
Let me check out the staff room.

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:28.200
Actually avoid answering Moe's question.

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:30.920
Guard had run out of here.

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.040
Something might be inside.

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:33.560
Some secret about Anahiko.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:37.880
You're right.

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:40.680
Just be careful, okay?

01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:45.960
I cover my wrist with my palm, making sure Moe doesn't miss.

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.480
The moment I put my hand on the knob,

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:54.360
a mark burned my skin, pulsing along with my beating heart.

01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.680
New info is added to the spirit file.

01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.640
Time to fight guard.

01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:06.440
All right.

01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:09.960
Record?

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:18.040
Let's check the memo out.

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:18.760
Anahiko?

01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:23.800
A mysterious backrabbit appeared in front of us out of nowhere.

01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:27.000
It's funny, but we've encountered so many strange things already.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And an odd bunny doesn't faze me at all.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.640
Though this paralyzing dread might be concerning anyway.

01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:33.480
Might be a bit concerning.

01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:35.480
Anyway, first we have to find that mirror.

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.600
Anahiko with the boy in the mirror.

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:41.320
Like the rumor said, Gassley Boy appeared.

01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.520
We answered some of his questions, then the mirror broke and he vanished.

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:48.760
No more big people here, he said.

01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:52.200
Like who is chasing something, then we heard a horrible scream.

01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:54.440
Came from the opposite end of the school.

01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:55.800
It sounded familiar.

01:59:57.560 --> 01:59:58.920
The mysteries didn't end there.

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:00.920
I heard a whisper in my ear and said,

02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:02.760
Purify with red.

02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.320
What was that eerie voice?

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.760
Maybe something was...

02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.360
Maybe something was...

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:09.080
That's going on.

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:11.080
It's making me go crazy.

02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:14.760
Regardless, we first need to find the true cause of that scream.

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:18.920
The guard we met at the school gate was the one who screamed.

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:22.840
Burst out of the staff room covered in growing plants of all things.

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:24.920
The pain was driving him mad.

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:26.520
The spirit do this?

02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.000
It must have been Anahiko.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:29.560
Which means...

02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:34.040
Inside the staff room is what we have to keep going.

02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:39.240
Okay, are you ready senpai?

02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:42.200
I feel like I'm gonna piss.

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:48.920
The staff room is in chaos.

02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:53.480
Furniture is upended and the walls are...

02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:56.360
Is there a fire here or something?

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.680
There are black scorch marks everywhere.

02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:01.180
Yeah.

02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:04.280
Boy, it looks relieved as they come out from behind me.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.240
Well, totally empty.

02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:11.640
Anyway, let's look around.

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:15.880
There's a door here too.

02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:17.080
It's like it goes to another room.

02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.320
I search the burnt posts.

02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:21.320
Something falls from the top of it.

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:23.640
It's bound to Warn out Talisman.

02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:26.680
I pick up the Warn out Talisman and feel a warmth flow through me.

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:29.480
Got the soul power.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.240
Warn out Talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.400
I think there's nothing else to do.

02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:44.440
I think there's something else.

02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:51.440
I think there's nothing else here, just here, walls near the window is burnt, there must

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:55.440
have been a fire here a long time ago.

02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:00.440
Open the door and left the staff room.

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:04.440
I cramped in here.

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:07.440
Is this a storage room?

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.440
Seems?

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.440
It seems to be.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:17.440
Hopefully there's something useful here.

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:21.440
There's a massive wooden cabinet.

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.440
It's really old, the corners of the doors are rounded off.

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:28.440
It's all in the door but just rattles in place.

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.440
Looks like it will open.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:35.440
Something's stopping it.

02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.440
Take out the letter opener.

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.440
What do I do with it?

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:44.440
I don't have any particularly good ideas.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:47.440
Your little shit.

02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:52.440
That one actually spooked me a little.

02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.440
That one actually spooked me a little.

02:02:54.440 --> 02:03:00.440
Oh, I just realized I'm super far away.

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.440
I opened the last door and checked inside.

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:04.440
There isn't anything that catches my eyes.

02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:07.440
That actually kind of spooked me a little.

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:13.440
Good thing I did kegels.

02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:15.440
Open the last door and check inside.

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.440
But there isn't anything that catches my eye.

02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:30.440
I went into super comfy mode and just leaned back.

02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.440
I think it's a school journal.

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:40.440
The paper deteriorated from ages and bugs so I can't read it.

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:43.440
There's a door cut in the floor.

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:45.440
Is it some kind of storage area?

02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.440
A little bit.

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:51.440
Built door big enough to fit an adult through.

02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:52.440
Feel?

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:55.440
My little head always retracted into the door.

02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.440
I had to get a grasp on it and pull it out

02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:02.440
but I am unsuccessful.

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.440
Letter opener again.

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.440
Easy, letter opener.

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:07.440
I might be able to pull the handle out.

02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:10.440
Spot down by the door.

02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:20.440
My mark bites into my wrists again.

02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:25.440
It's almost like it's trying to stop me from searching under the floor.

02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:28.440
Stand up pretending to be calm.

02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:30.440
Hey, that's worrying.

02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:33.440
I think dangerous must be here.

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.440
What's wrong?

02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:37.440
Are you going to see what that is?

02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:42.440
I'll check it out later.

02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:47.440
Keep my reply big as I dust off my knees.

02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:50.440
Let's look around the room first.

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:53.440
There's a bunch of interesting stuff in here.

02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.440
I have nothing.

02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.440
It's something beneath our feet.

02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:03.440
We better make sure we're prepared for going down there.

02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:06.440
Can I shake it more?

02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:12.440
I feel it on the door but it just rattles in place.

02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:23.440
Look.

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.440
I don't see it anywhere.

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.440
What's this?

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:30.440
Something stuck in the hole for the screw.

02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:35.440
Seems that wooden thing works as a lock.

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:38.440
I have to do something about that to open the door.

02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:39.440
Seriously?

02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.440
I used the letter opener before?

02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:46.440
I might be able to pop out whatever stuck in the hole.

02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:49.440
That's the idea at least.

02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:51.440
I hope it won't fit at all.

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:53.440
The knife is too big.

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:58.440
What else can I use?

02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:01.440
Open the last door and check inside.

02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:07.440
There isn't anything that catches my eye.

02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:09.440
Anything else?

02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:11.440
Oh, there's a box up there.

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:14.440
That's the cardboard box on top of the cabinet.

02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:16.440
I think I can reach it.

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:19.440
Something's written on the marker at the side of the box.

02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:24.440
Austin is legible but the rest of the letter smudged.

02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:26.440
I feel.

02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:29.440
Yep, I grabbed the box and looked inside.

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:33.440
Got lipstick, red pen, and girl slippers.

02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:34.440
Good job, mister.

02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:37.440
I knew there was a reason you were tall.

02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:41.440
Shit.

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:42.440
Now that means...

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:43.440
Oops!

02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:46.440
That's the wrong thing.

02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.440
Examined first.

02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:49.440
Tools.

02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:53.440
Maybe I can use the red pen?

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:54.440
Take out the red pen.

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.440
I used the pen.

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:59.440
I might be able to pop open whatever's inside the hole.

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.440
Wow.

02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:09.440
You've got skills.

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.440
Is that surprising?

02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:16.440
Well, I need to focus.

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.440
Friendly.

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:21.440
Resistance vanishes and the pen pokes all the way through.

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:25.440
Hold my hand on the door and slide it open without any issue.

02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.440
It's a red tube inside.

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:30.440
Got flair.

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:31.440
A flair?

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.440
What's that for?

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:36.440
I mean, you don't know what a flair is.

02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:40.440
Also, the next book I may need to go potty.

02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:46.440
It's a signal light for an emergency.

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:49.440
It's a good idea to always have one in your car.

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.440
Oh, okay then.

02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:56.440
But, Moe, I picked something off the floor.

02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:57.440
The thorn.

02:07:57.440 --> 02:08:01.440
As long as my pinky finger.

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.440
That's what was in the hole.

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:06.440
I don't mean time call.

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:07.440
I'm a little nervous.

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:08.440
Not gonna lie.

02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:10.440
I'm not gonna lie.

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:13.440
I'm a little nervous.

02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:18.440
This is so not a coincidence.

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:20.440
Bet he didn't want anyone to have that.

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:23.440
Put a thorn in the hole.

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:30.440
Is he scared of this?

02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:37.440
You both look at the flair again.

02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:46.440
Why did you turn off the light?

02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:49.440
That wasn't me.

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:53.440
I didn't turn it off, it just went off.

02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:55.440
What was that noise?

02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:57.440
Hey mister, what was that noise?

02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:00.440
Shh, be quiet.

02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:02.440
Struggling not to yell with my nerves on edge.

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:05.440
I hit the flashlight again and again.

02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:07.440
Come on, please.

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:10.440
The batteries were just working.

02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:14.440
I feel like I'm performing CPR on this thing.

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:17.440
Finally.

02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:21.440
Got it.

02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:25.440
Door behind me warps threateningly.

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:33.440
I mark burns and pain.

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:36.440
Get this already in the room next door.

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:40.440
There's no time and nowhere to run.

02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:41.440
Calm down.

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.440
We find a way out of this quickly.

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:44.440
We're running out of time.

02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:52.440
We did survive, but got to hurry.

02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:54.440
I cut the letter opener and shoved it in.

02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:56.440
I might be able to get the handle out this way.

02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:59.440
I touched the metal, my mark scored.

02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:01.440
Not moving for just a second.

02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:04.440
But I have to do this.

02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:05.440
Yeah, I got it.

02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:08.440
I grabbed the handle and lift up the trapdoor.

02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:11.440
I thought a dark hole leads down under the floor.

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:13.440
Get in!

02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:15.440
I shove Moe into the hole.

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:22.440
And I slide down into the darkness after them.

02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.440
Ah!

02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:31.440
I fall unexpectedly far, hitting my head.

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:34.440
Hitting my back against something.

02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:42.440
Get my teeth to stop myself from yelling.

02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:46.440
Something shuffling above my head.

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:52.440
If we had just stayed there just a few more seconds.

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:55.440
I grip my burning wrist with all my might.

02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:02.440
I must endure the pain for now.

02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:04.440
I can hear anxious panting.

02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:07.440
Moe must be right next to me.

02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.440
Making so hard, I can see it from the corner of my eye.

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:19.440
I brace myself, expecting the trapdoor to break open any second.

02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:21.440
The shuffling noise.

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:26.440
It only grows distant.

02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:29.440
Is it okay now?

02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:31.440
Yeah.

02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:34.440
I think it's gone.

02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:40.440
Suddenly my wrist isn't hurting anymore.

02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:44.440
Thank God, I thought we were done for this time.

02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:48.440
Anyway, where are we?

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.440
Where in the world is this room?

02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:55.440
I'm surprised this place exists beneath the school.

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:58.440
Can you turn on the light?

02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.440
Yeah.

02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:07.440
I cautiously press the switch, being careful not to make any noise.

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:11.440
Girls.

02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:20.440
The scene captured in the light of the flashlight sends shivers down my spine.

02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:28.440
Moe slaps a hand over her mouth.

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:35.440
In a few moments, all we can do is stare in silence.

02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:40.440
It's sort of pretty with the flowers, I guess.

02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:50.440
A disturbing scene, more horrible than anything I've ever seen before, spread out before us.

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:55.440
Anyone would be shocked by it, especially a kid.

02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:58.440
I take a deep breath and look closer.

02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:01.440
There's something twisting around the corpse.

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:06.440
It's like some kind of plant vine.

02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:11.440
Those roses?

02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:17.440
The strangely sharp thorns and the thin red petals.

02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:20.440
They appear to be real.

02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:27.440
Five roses covering the corpses and carpeting the floor.

02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:30.440
My vision suddenly grows dim.

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:36.440
Ahh!

02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:42.440
Ahh!

02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:46.440
Ahh!

02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:49.440
Don't look, Senpai! Don't look! Don't look!

02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:51.440
Don't look!

02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.440
I know! Don't look!

02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:59.440
Don't look, Senpai!

02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:08.440
Don't look!

02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:17.440
I see a woman's body trapped by roses.

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:26.440
What? What is this?

02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:29.440
The tragedy that happened in this room.

02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:35.440
Don't look, Senpai!

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.440
As if it's all playing out in my head.

02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:46.440
I can see it.

02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:56.440
Girls? Girlses? What are they doing here?

02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.440
Did someone plant them?

02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:00.440
Okay.

02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:03.440
You're safe, Senpai. Senpai.

02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:10.440
I think you can look again.

02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:16.440
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:25.440
Moe's voice brings me back to reality.

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.440
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:31.440
Always protecting Senpai. Always protecting Senpai.

02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:46.440
No ogling!

02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:50.440
Yeah. I can't tell them what I...

02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:53.440
I can't tell them that I saw some waking dream.

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.440
I scrambled to remember the conversation.

02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:59.440
That's right. I saw the rose vines then.

02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:01.440
It's got to be it.

02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:07.440
It's not like they're just bringing up on their own.

02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:10.440
Why would anyone do that?

02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:12.440
Did someone decorate the corpse?

02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:15.440
Is this for some kind of reason?

02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:19.440
Did they die captured by the roses like I saw in the vision?

02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:25.440
Moe screams.

02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:28.440
What's wrong? What's wrong?

02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:31.440
Something moved. See?

02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:36.440
Over there! Back in there!

02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:44.440
It's something hiding in here.

02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.440
Mattress is completely discolored.

02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:49.440
It's stained with something that looks like sweat.

02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:55.440
Someone must have been living here for a long time, too.

02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:59.440
Too old.

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:00.440
Letter opener?

02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:02.440
It got the letter opener.

02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:05.440
What do I do with it? I don't have any in particular!

02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:07.440
Fuck! Do I just feel?

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:10.440
Mattress is oozing dark, dirty water.

02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:13.440
Smells like sewage.

02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:17.440
Slide the mattress over and find a plastic sheet underneath it.

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.440
Got a vinyl sheet!

02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:21.440
Pretty thick.

02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:25.440
Was it put there to protect from water damage?

02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:27.440
Off of the sheet is pitch black.

02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:31.440
At first glance, it looks like it's covered in mold.

02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:36.440
I spread it open. It crunches as dark red flakes fall from it.

02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:38.440
This is blood.

02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:43.440
One endowed knife! I'm just going to point a knife at it!

02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:48.440
Can't do anything, but whisper dumbfounded as I stare at the bloodstained sheet.

02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:54.440
I think murmurs in my ear as I reply.

02:17:54.440 --> 02:18:03.440
Their blood denies him.

02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:05.440
Part of me takes the voice seriously.

02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:09.440
I'm clearly hallucinating, but for some reason calms me down.

02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:14.440
So in days, I shine the flashlight under the bed.

02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:17.440
There it is again! Something's there!

02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:20.440
Chloe's voice has gone very shrill.

02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.440
What happened?

02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:25.440
Hey, now. Give me a break.

02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:27.440
I'm no monster, you know.

02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:30.440
A regular human being.

02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:33.440
Who are you?

02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:36.440
Wait, I remember you. No, I remember you. I remember you.

02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:38.440
I remember you. I remember you.

02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:40.440
Nope, I remember you.

02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:43.440
I play this far. Yeah. Wait, I remember you.

02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:48.440
It's fine. It's fine. Who are you?

02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:52.440
This is why I grabbed the knife.

02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:55.440
Something slowly climbs out from under the bed.

02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:00.440
It's a man in a trench coat.

02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:06.440
A person? What were you doing under there?

02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:09.440
The man looks bored. He scoffs.

02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:11.440
The same as you.

02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:14.440
And that monster escaped down here.

02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:17.440
And you guys came.

02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:21.440
The man turns his back to us and jerks his chin.

02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:24.440
Anyhow, I was hiding over there.

02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:30.440
His answer is believable enough.

02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:33.440
But why is he at the school to begin with?

02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:37.440
His presence raises a lot of questions.

02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:42.440
The man tilts his head a bit and peers at me and snorts.

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.440
He seems through me.

02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.440
You don't look like you believe...

02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:49.440
You don't look like you believe me.

02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:51.440
I guess that's only natural.

02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:54.440
I haven't told you everything either.

02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:57.440
I could, but...

02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:00.440
The man looks around at his feet.

02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:02.440
Better get out of here first.

02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:05.440
I shouldn't chat at a crime scene.

02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:07.440
I think you're right.

02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:11.440
Oh, he seems to feel the same way.

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:14.440
Let's head back for now.

02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:18.440
You have somewhere to go back to? Good.

02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:21.440
Then let's get going.

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:23.440
The man puts his hand on the ladder.

02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:26.440
He pauses and turns to us.

02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:29.440
The name's Satoru Mashita.

02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:32.440
I'm an ex-detective.

02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:34.440
I forgot to mention that.

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:40.440
The man named Mashita disappears up the ladder.

02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:43.440
We follow him back up to the first floor.

02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:47.440
But when we emerge, he's not there.

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:50.440
Hey, take a look at this.

02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:55.440
Mashita's calling us from down the hallway.

02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:58.440
Was it like this when you guys came through?

02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:02.440
Oh, he pipes up, voice slightly wobbly.

02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:04.440
No, it wasn't.

02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:07.440
It wasn't like this at all.

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:14.440
Something's creeping along the hallway.

02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:17.440
The rose finds.

02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:19.440
Not so.

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:22.440
I didn't see them before either.

02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:29.440
Oh, ow!

02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:32.440
The mark's color grow more vivid.

02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:36.440
Early dawn, a few hours left until death closes in.

02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:54.440
Some people naturally put others on guard,

02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:57.440
even if there's no particular ill will between them.

02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:01.440
It's exactly the type of person Mashita is.

02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:07.440
Oh, you've got nice stuff here.

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:10.440
The moment he climbs in the car, he makes a grab for my bag,

02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:13.440
and he starts inspecting all of my stuff.

02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:16.440
I wasn't planning on keeping a constant eye on him,

02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:19.440
but he's making it very hard not to.

02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:22.440
Oh, he seems like the type to stick her nose in everything,

02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:27.440
but he's suspiciously silent as if exhausted.

02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:29.440
Are you okay, Moe?

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:33.440
Huh? Oh, yeah, just zoning out, you know?

02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:36.440
I'm fine.

02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:43.440
He doesn't look fine, but my other passenger is of more concern right now.

02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:48.440
So, were you at the school because you were investigating something?

02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:54.440
I'm not on the force anymore, just poking around for my own reasons.

02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:57.440
Something I wanted to check.

02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:02.440
I don't doubt what he says, but that would mean he entered the school illegally.

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:05.440
What were you?

02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:08.440
Let me ask one thing first.

02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:13.440
Mashita interrupts my question and points to my arm.

02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:17.440
Does that hurt?

02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:21.440
It doesn't take him long to spot the mark on my wrist.

02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:26.440
Sometimes it hurts the most whenever I'm in danger.

02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:30.440
Huh, is that so?

02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:34.440
Mashita leans back in his seat, satisfied.

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:38.440
I was investigating some missing people.

02:23:38.440 --> 02:23:41.440
Guess he's responding to my question now.

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:45.440
That school came up with a number of missing persons cases.

02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:50.440
Each one had some affiliation with age elementary before they disappeared.

02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:54.440
Teachers, workers, people in the BTA, students and their family members.

02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:56.440
I was looking for them.

02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:59.440
Then...

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:02.440
Moe speaks up from the back seat.

02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:04.440
Are those people?

02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:07.440
The corpses down there?

02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:10.440
Doesn't sound as energetic as she usually did.

02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:13.440
Does something happen after all?

02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:15.440
Is her mark?

02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.440
Mashita doesn't reply.

02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:22.440
Maybe he thinks the answer is obvious, or maybe replying to a kid isn't worth his time.

02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:25.440
Something bugs me about what he just said.

02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:28.440
The school was clearly suspicious then.

02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:31.440
Of course, I brought it up to my superiors.

02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:34.440
All I got for it was...

02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:40.440
Continues before I can ask, making a slashing motion across his neck.

02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:43.440
You got fired, huh?

02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:51.440
Disciplinary discharge, something about sexually harassing us, so burden it!

02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:59.440
That principal's gotta get some kind of pull, gotta have some kind of political pull.

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:05.440
I probably dug up something he didn't want to get out.

02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:11.440
That wasn't my plan, I never meant to uncover anything dirty.

02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:15.440
True, the school did have that suspicious room.

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:20.440
Not that strange to think it would come up in some missing persons cases.

02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:23.440
That would be common sense at least.

02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:27.440
Common sense is for the world of the living.

02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:34.440
The spirit might have something to do with those cases.

02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:38.440
There's an awkward silence.

02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:43.440
In that sense, this isn't even a case anymore, is it?

02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:46.440
I should just size deeply.

02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:48.440
I would believe it.

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.440
I would believe that there's a monster in that school killing people.

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:54.440
It's personal now.

02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:56.440
Our problem.

02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.440
And we're on our own.

02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:01.440
He turns his wrist over and shows it to me.

02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:06.440
On his skin is the familiar mark.

02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:11.440
Yeah, I sensed it as soon as I saw yours.

02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.440
I had a feeling this would be a problem.

02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:17.440
We're in the same boat, you and I.

02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:21.440
He's got good instincts.

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:24.440
We should talk more when we get back.

02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:27.440
At Kujo Mansion, there's some...

02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:29.440
Stopped myself from finishing my sentence.

02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:32.440
I shouldn't mention that for now.

02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:37.440
In any case, once we get back, we'll give you more details.

02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:42.440
Yeah, I'm sure they'll help him a bunch.

02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:44.440
Yeah, I'll share that to help him a bunch.

02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:49.440
Who the fuck said that?

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.440
I might as she takes off.

02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:54.440
Is that Moe?

02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:57.440
So hard when all of them are in the same color.

02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:01.440
Yeah, she did help him a lot.

02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:02.440
Help, huh?

02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:05.440
You're underestimating me.

02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:13.440
Who the do's a pale or an orange?

02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:18.440
You think I can tell the difference?

02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:22.440
When I got out from the car,

02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:24.440
someone's there to keep me.

02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:26.440
Welcome back, mister.

02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:27.440
You too, Miss Moe.

02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:29.440
Well, you're unharmed.

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:32.440
Any clues about the spirit?

02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:34.440
What?

02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:37.440
So there's others.

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:39.440
This is everyone.

02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:44.440
Huh, what a reliable group you've got.

02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:48.440
The sarcasm is practically dripping off his words.

02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:51.440
So...

02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:56.440
Are you all planning to continue to search for that key or whatever it is?

02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:58.440
I don't have anything to go on.

02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:00.440
There's no other choice.

02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:02.440
I don't understand you.

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:05.440
The source of the mark is the spirit.

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:11.440
It would be best to destroy the source, don't you think?

02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:13.440
What do you mean?

02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:18.440
The spirit exists, so all you have to do is kill it.

02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:22.440
Are you serious?

02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:23.440
Of course he's serious.

02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:26.440
He doesn't exactly look like the joking type.

02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:30.440
Even if we manage to kill it, will that really make the mark disappear?

02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:35.440
When I considered everything Mary's told me, it doesn't look like it would work that way.

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:40.440
Even assuming it did would have a more fundamental problem.

02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:42.440
How do you plan to kill it?

02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:45.440
I'll figure something out.

02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:52.440
If something exists, there's logically a way to destroy it as well.

02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:57.440
He claims he can kill the spirit yet he doesn't even know how to do it.

02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:01.440
This is all that confidence come from.

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:05.440
Don't forget, I faced him once already.

02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:08.440
If we're seriously thinking of killing him.

02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:11.440
Actually there are graphs as well.

02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:15.440
A little shit took a shot.

02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:20.440
Wow, these are hard to read. Hold on.

02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:24.440
The little shit shot some kind of thorn at me from a distance.

02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:29.440
Hit me hard enough to stick in concrete. No way to get close to him.

02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:32.440
I have to make that a priority.

02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:36.440
Mash it up, pull something out of the hue of his shoe and toss it to me.

02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:39.440
The thorn curved like a thing.

02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:42.440
The only reason I'm still breathing is because I was lucky.

02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:49.440
It won't happen next time. We need a plan.

02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:52.440
If we head to the entrance, I tell Mashita about Kujo Mansion.

02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:54.440
He takes it all in silently.

02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:59.440
Even bringing up the talking doll or Saiya Kujo's death doesn't trigger a reaction.

02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:03.440
Why is he so unnervingly calm?

02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:09.440
Because he's already dealt with the supernatural?

02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:13.440
We reach the main hall which is warmly lit.

02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:18.440
This is a strange mansion, but for some reason I feel like I've come home.

02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:28.440
A climatization is kind of terrifying.

02:30:28.440 --> 02:30:32.440
Welcome back, my darling.

02:30:32.440 --> 02:30:36.440
That man is a markbearer too, I see.

02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:40.440
Would you make the introductions?

02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:46.440
I update Mary on our investigation in the strange way we met Mashita.

02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:50.440
The mirror, the underground room full of corpses, the sudden appearance of roses.

02:30:50.440 --> 02:30:56.440
I really hate to admit it, but it's clear something supernatural is at work.

02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:59.440
And the spirit that is the cause of all of it?

02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:02.440
Hanahiko.

02:31:02.440 --> 02:31:07.440
There's no doubt that Hanahiko is the one who put the mark on Mashita's arm too.

02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:09.440
But...

02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:15.440
Stop flashbanging me!

02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:19.440
What kind of chance do we have against a monster that can do that?

02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:22.440
Weed killer, okay, you know what?

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:25.440
But are roses weeds?

02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:29.440
I don't think so.

02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:32.440
Mashita says we should kill him.

02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:36.440
Is that even possible?

02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:39.440
Hey, darling.

02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:41.440
Sorry.

02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:44.440
I didn't know who that was, so I was like...

02:31:44.440 --> 02:31:45.440
Darling.

02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:55.440
Okay, so now it's, hey, darling.

02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:57.440
Oops, I dropped my bopple.

02:31:57.440 --> 02:32:05.440
My little ice rollers.

02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:07.440
My train of thought is interrupted.

02:32:07.440 --> 02:32:08.440
I'm sorry.

02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:09.440
I'm sorry.

02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:11.440
I'm sorry, Senpai.

02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:13.440
My fujiyo mind is racing.

02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:18.440
I'm starting to make fan fiction in my head.

02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:21.440
But then I remembered our protagonist is Senpai, so now I'm just like,

02:32:21.440 --> 02:32:31.440
maybe I should scrap that idea.

02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:33.440
My train of thought is interrupted.

02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:40.440
Mashita's holding a leather-bound notebook out towards me.

02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:45.440
Read this.

02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:48.440
I picked it up in that underground room.

02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:52.440
It was caught up in a bunch of those rose vines when I found it.

02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:55.440
It was pretty hard to get loose.

02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:57.440
Did you read it?

02:32:57.440 --> 02:32:59.440
I skimmed through a bit.

02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:07.440
It's got some interesting stuff.

02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:08.440
I saw.

02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:09.440
That's what he says.

02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:12.440
But he's not smiling at all.

02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:14.440
It's a shimmer.

02:33:14.440 --> 02:33:17.440
A shimmer with a quiet anger.

02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:18.440
I was like, shimmer.

02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:20.440
No, that's not a shimmer.

02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:23.440
Dark red mark staying the cover.

02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:26.440
I have a bad feeling that I flipped through it.

02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:33.440
Rose petals fall as they become unstuck from the pages.

02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:38.440
The notes within are very detailed.

02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:42.440
The author was intelligent and well-written.

02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:49.440
Reading through it dawns on me that this was written by H. Elementary's principal.

02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:55.440
The austere, meticulous letter on each page tell a ghastly story.

02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:03.440
The skirts of a young, adopted boy's tutoring sessions.

02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:06.440
The first note is from five years ago.

02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:12.440
It seems the boy adopted by the principal was small and exceedingly cute.

02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:15.440
He enjoyed wearing skirts and makeup too.

02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:20.440
I was so denying that they truly suited a dainty red-cheeked boy like him.

02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:23.440
But the principal had a hard time accepting such fancies.

02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:25.440
Bad habits must be corrected.

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:32.440
Young must be corrected young to promote sound, mental and healthy thought.

02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:40.440
So he called it tutoring as a cover for his warped desires.

02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:43.440
They took place in the underground room.

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:46.440
Too many prying eyes anywhere else.

02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:50.440
There was no safer place than the school at night.

02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:54.440
Once all the teachers had left.

02:34:54.440 --> 02:35:01.440
No! No!

02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:08.440
The principal stayed behind under the pretense of keeping watch, then tutored.

02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:11.440
He was a highly respected teacher.

02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:14.440
He even made appearances on TV.

02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:19.440
There's no reason to be suspicious.

02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:26.440
The only one who noticed anything strange was the boy's homeroom teacher.

02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:37.440
But she feared the principal's power and firmly kept her mouth shut.

02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:41.440
As the notes continue, they are more and more deranged.

02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:43.440
They paint a horrible picture.

02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:48.440
It is of a totally distorted parent and child.

02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:51.440
My child gets weaker after every session.

02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:55.440
His delicate frame has grown thinner and his red cheeks are now darkened.

02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:58.440
His appearance is described in detail.

02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:00.440
There is no malice or hatred.

02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:10.440
It's just fanatical sincerity is pride as an educator.

02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:16.440
And a terrifying smothering love.

02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:20.440
I don't like where this is going!

02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:25.440
It continues like that to the very last page.

02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:28.440
There's no mention of what became of the principal and the boy.

02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:34.440
Going by the current state of H elementary, I can hazard a guess.

02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:38.440
You don't look so well, mister.

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:40.440
I was in the notebook.

02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:42.440
The cast up here is up at me.

02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:46.440
He and the boy in the notebook are about the same age.

02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:48.440
This is the stuff you share with the kid.

02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:53.440
I better just sum up the main points for him.

02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:55.440
That's terrible.

02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:58.440
Each children are always the victims of eagles of adults.

02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:01.440
Stupid grown ups are irredeemable!

02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:03.440
Okay, chill!

02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:05.440
Chill, kid!

02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:12.440
Why do you say that makes sense?

02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:14.440
Yeah, but kid, chill!

02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:16.440
I know!

02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:19.440
I know!

02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:29.440
The revolting evil of adults and the poor boy who became a victim.

02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:32.440
But is that really the end?

02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:35.440
If Hanahiko and the boy in the notebook are connected,

02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:42.440
and the boy turned into a monster, is that even possible?

02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:44.440
I'm like, yeah, I get it!

02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:45.440
I get it, kid!

02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:54.440
I get it, just chill, chill!

02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:58.440
Untimely deaths produce hatred.

02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:01.440
Death does not bring it to an end.

02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:08.440
Such festering sentiments can give birth to the supernatural.

02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:14.440
Monsters, ghosts, vengeful spirits, they have many names.

02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:20.440
I believe that you have all heard one or two such stories.

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:23.440
And an eagle is similar.

02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:26.440
Mary's words are hard to swallow.

02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:31.440
After all those weird events, it only makes sense to accept them.

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:40.440
If I turn my back to the truth, all that will await me is death.

02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:43.440
And who's talking?

02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:46.440
And Hanahiko is really a monster.

02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:50.440
Yeah, you must form a plan based off of that hypothesis.

02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:54.440
Who's talking?

02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:56.440
Mary is silent a moment.

02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:02.440
Then her jade glass eyes shift to Mashita.

02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:08.440
Incidentally, according to Lord Darling's report,

02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:13.440
there are those amongst you who are considered killing the spirit.

02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:19.440
Wait, what the fuck is talking?

02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:23.440
There are those among you who are considering killing the spirit.

02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:26.440
I shall warn you just in case.

02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:30.440
That would be very difficult to do.

02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:34.440
Why is that?

02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:40.440
I could see Mashita in Nero's eyes, but I made sure to speak up first.

02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:44.440
They are from the world of the dead.

02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:47.440
Just as the living cannot become more alive,

02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:49.440
the dead cannot be killed.

02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:55.440
The only thing that could possibly destroy is the cursed sentiment.

02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:59.440
So what does that mean?

02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:05.440
It's as I told you before, death and life existing together.

02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:13.440
If that is the origin of the mark, no way to erase it will be there.

02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:21.440
I swear they need to add name plates to someone because I don't know who's talking sometimes.

02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:28.440
By driving away the spirit, the curse will also be eliminated.

02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:33.440
So defeating Hena Hiko is how we'll be able to destroy the mark.

02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:39.440
Setting aside how he can't be killed, what exactly is the key then?

02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:42.440
There's nothing more than a concept.

02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:47.440
I am unsure, but I am certain of one thing.

02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:51.440
Fate ties the spirit to its place of birth.

02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:57.440
An object there may be able to fill the role of the key.

02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:02.440
It's a difficult concept to grasp, but that is just how spirits are.

02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:08.440
Determining the nature of the key, that would aside your fate.

02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:15.440
I had a feeling we'll have to keep digging around each elementary.

02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:19.440
We don't know what cursed sentiments or the key is destroying the grudge.

02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:26.440
We don't know what the cursed sentiments or the key to destroying the grudges are.

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:31.440
Gaining the key and lifting the grudge is the only way to survive.

02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:37.440
It would be required to be callous to make use of the spirit's fear.

02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:41.440
The way to repel the spirit lies within its grudge.

02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:48.440
Remember this, and be careful, and be careful.

02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:55.440
New info was added to the spirit file, the secret of the underground room.

02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:02.440
I think Senpai, is this a good place to save?

02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:14.440
Because I know we didn't get too far in this visual novel, but I'm a little tired.

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:18.440
I'm a little tired.

02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:24.440
It's been a long day, Senpai.

02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:29.440
Mm-mm.

02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:37.440
Oops.

02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:40.440
I don't remember.

02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:47.440
I can go yet and it's here.

02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:51.440
Ugh.

02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:57.440
I'm so sleepy.

02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:01.440
Yeah, I wanna leave a-

02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:09.440
I wanna leave the game.

02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:15.440
Wah!

02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:18.440
I hope to get the best sleep.

02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:20.440
Senpai, I will.

02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:25.440
Also, Senpai was very good and didn't look.

02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:35.440
You kept yourself pure.

02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:43.440
I'd like to review next week's...

02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:46.440
Next week's...

02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:54.440
So tomorrow, when I said I was slowing down, that was a total lie for this week,

02:43:54.440 --> 02:44:01.440
so I checked the following week is when I go to three streams.

02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:05.440
Instead, next week is also five streams.

02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:06.440
It's five streams.

02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:10.440
It's not an entire week, so I'm not fully exhausted.

02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:14.440
But tomorrow, we're back here again.

02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.440
What terrible life advice!

02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:22.440
Give me your life, give me your questions through morals.

02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:24.440
Or ask them in chat.

02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:30.440
Mostly, I would mostly appreciate it if you asked them through morals.

02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:34.440
By morals, I mean marshmallows.

02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:39.440
Scroll down.

02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:41.440
Go down.

02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:51.440
And ask questions about or send me your questions.

02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:56.440
And I will give you the answers that you need.

02:44:56.440 --> 02:44:59.440
Is it going to be good answers?

02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:01.440
Probably not.

02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:03.440
Is it answers?

02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:06.440
Yeah, actually, it's gonna be answers.

02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:09.440
What do marshmallows do you get a day?

02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:18.440
It really depends.

02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:33.440
Sometimes, I have...

02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:39.440
I get lots of morals, and sometimes, I get not too many morals.

02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:46.440
And then, some days, I'm like...

02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:51.440
And then, some days, it's just not very nice morals.

02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:56.440
And I'm just like, oh, whatever.

02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:02.440
Between one to a lot, a few?

02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:17.440
A few, I guess?

02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:26.440
A few, I guess, so...

02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:33.440
Right now, I probably have about 200 morals I have to go through.

02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:39.440
Some of them I don't really answer, because I'm just like taking them to heart, and I'm just like, thank you.

02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:47.440
Although, I should probably give them hearts, because I haven't been doing that.

02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:55.440
I have around 200 morals, plus...

02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:00.440
Yeah, so...

02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:05.440
Yeah, we've been getting a lot of morals.

02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:12.440
A lot of them, I feel bad if I repeat them.

02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:22.440
But I should probably start hearting some morals to let some pies know that I've read them.

02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:30.440
So I think, yeah, that's pretty, yeah.

02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:32.440
That's a lot of morals.

02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:37.440
I don't answer it as much as my senpai, not my senpai story, my genmais.

02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:43.440
Wow, I'm mixing you up, senpai on the mind, senpai brain rot.

02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.440
That...

02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:55.440
I'm not as active, because I'm kind of awkward, and I don't know what to reply.

02:47:55.440 --> 02:48:04.440
And if I feel like I just say, oh, thank you, senpai, or wow, that was really hot senpai, I feel like...

02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:07.440
I feel like it's not a good enough response.

02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:12.440
So then I don't answer, and then I feel worse.

02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:15.440
Don't put your genmates in the basement.

02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:19.440
I'm a steak.

02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:21.440
I think they're fine, I can recognize them.

02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:26.440
I'll be like, I'll lift up, I'll be like, oh, you don't go there.

02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:36.440
He shone the forehead.

02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:39.440
Yeah, likewise I never know what to write for similar reasons.

02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:43.440
I don't know what to say.

02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:50.440
Otherwise, other than, thank you for supporting me.

02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:54.440
I'm kind of stupid.

02:48:54.440 --> 02:49:00.440
But yeah, tomorrow will be terrible life advice plush marshmallow Q&A.

02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:05.440
I can fully say that I'm not really prepared for it, so I can just...

02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:11.440
It's probably going to be just saying, saying stuff.

02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:17.440
And maybe mixed in with the terrible life advice is some actual life advice.

02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:19.440
Who knows?

02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:26.440
Going in.

02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:29.440
And then I get a day off.

02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:36.440
But luckily on that day off, I think my second audio for Patreon is released.

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:43.440
So you can have that in my stead.

02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:48.440
Then I'm continuing Omari.

02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:54.440
And then I'm doing Power Wash Simulator, which is my first collab.

02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:58.440
No wait, technically my second collab with my genmates.

02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:00.440
And then after that is Zatsu Yapping.

02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:02.440
So I just yapp about whatever.

02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:08.440
Probably updates saying...

02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:19.440
Probably updates about how I'm feeling, what's it like to be in VLR so far, etc.

02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:24.440
Then after that, Saturday I have a break.

02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:32.440
Then Sunday I have an unarchived karaoke stream.

02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:34.440
So it'll be unarchived.

02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:37.440
I'll be singing, you know, songs.

02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:46.440
Maybe not well, but I'll be singing.

02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:49.440
So yeah, I hope some friends can tune into that.

02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:53.440
Or if you're like, wow, that schedule seems like it sucks.

02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:58.440
Don't tune in, just kill.

02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:03.440
And then I'll see you next week, I guess.

02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:05.440
But yeah, I really want to play Harvester again.

02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:09.440
So I'm going to play Harvester and Killer 7 again.

02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:21.440
So I'd really love to see that.

02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:23.440
Anyway, you sing is the correct way.

02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:25.440
We are a captive audience.

02:51:25.440 --> 02:51:28.440
Mercy singing us to us is always welcome.

02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:30.440
Don't get the holes.

02:51:30.440 --> 02:51:33.440
Be nice to me, senpai.

02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:37.440
It's going to be my first time singing in front of my senpai.

02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:47.440
So I think I'll be a little bit more nervous than usual.

02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:53.440
I'll probably be singing songs I'm familiar with and some new songs that I'm just like, yeah.

02:51:53.440 --> 02:52:00.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:02.440
So, yeah.

02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:04.440
That's it for today.

02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:06.440
Let me check.

02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:08.440
What's going on?

02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:13.440
Oh my gosh, Azura is still live?

02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:15.440
Give me a second, senpai.

02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:27.440
I forget how to do this, but I'm going to figure out how to raid.

02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:30.440
I forgot how to do it.

02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:39.440
It's always because my gen mates raid into me.

02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:42.440
Raid into me and I'm not really the one.

02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:43.440
Okay, hold on.

02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:44.440
I think I found it.

02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:46.440
I think I found it.

02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:47.440
Please wait for me.

02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:50.440
Okay, senpai.

02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:56.440
What is this?

02:52:56.440 --> 02:52:59.440
This?

02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:01.440
I found it.

02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:07.440
I found a senpai.

02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:23.440
She's live.

02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:24.440
I can redirect.

02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:27.440
I can do it.

02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:29.440
Okay, senpai.

02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:33.440
It should redirect now and if it doesn't, just go over there, okay?

02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:35.440
I love you, senpai.

02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:37.440
See you again tomorrow.

02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:40.440
And I'm going to rest up now.

02:53:40.440 --> 02:53:41.440
Thank you.

02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:44.440
I'm so sorry that I was so very tired and messing and stumbling on my words.

02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:45.440
I was just...

02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:49.440
I was not there.

02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:51.440
Thank you, senpai.

02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:55.440
And I'll see you again next time.

02:53:55.440 --> 02:53:57.440
Scream for Mercy!

02:53:57.440 --> 02:53:59.440
Bye-bye!

02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:01.440
Mwah!
