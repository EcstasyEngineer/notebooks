07:30.000 --> 08:00.000
Call Hiyoooo Allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

08:00.000 --> 08:05.520
too much to the right? Should I move over? I feel like I should move over.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.520
Nah, maybe I'll walk too much up the screen.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.960
I'll make myself bigger.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.800
I'll make myself bigger. Why do I have two of these open?

08:24.400 --> 08:25.680
One of these has to go.

08:26.560 --> 08:30.640
One of these things is not like the other.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.760
One of these things made me lose tracking.

08:41.920 --> 08:47.680
Wow, I had everything so ready some pie and now I'm being a klutz.

08:55.680 --> 09:03.680
It's like you can still hear my voice.

09:04.960 --> 09:10.160
Okay, anyways, whoa, whoa, whoa, welcome senpai. Welcome to the screen. Welcome to Deathmark again.

09:10.800 --> 09:18.000
I have good news. My rash has gone so much down, got down so much.

09:18.560 --> 09:24.320
Yesterday I was like, it looks like my arm again and not some and not like him.

09:25.680 --> 09:33.600
Let me grab my controller. I'm so not ready for this.

09:37.760 --> 09:43.600
What happened and how? I don't know. I literally, I think it was my bed sheets.

09:43.600 --> 09:51.920
I put them in the wash and then I put them back onto my bed and then like overnight it got like X,

09:51.920 --> 09:56.160
like super better. I was like, thank you.

10:04.640 --> 10:11.520
But I'm so happy. Oh, and thank you Griffith for the 10 members. I hope everyone enjoys the memberships.

10:13.520 --> 10:17.760
Evil bed sheets, right? How long did you have those bed sheets?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.320
Oh, five, half a year now.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.920
Did stress play a role in your rash? Probably, 100% probably.

10:33.920 --> 10:42.240
Like it's, I don't know, maybe, maybe I like went to bed with, I don't know, something or maybe

10:42.240 --> 10:48.000
mama, mama or papa was cleaning up in there and they had like, I don't know, stuff on them.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.200
Who knows? How often do you wash them? Washing? What does that mean?

10:53.200 --> 10:55.200
I don't know.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.760
Forget about it. Forget about it. You don't need to wash shades?

11:15.760 --> 11:18.880
I learned my lesson. No worry. Let me move over here a little bit. Yeah, we go.

11:23.200 --> 11:32.720
Oh, but like those are actually new bed sheets. I don't know what happened, but they were new and I've been like using them for

11:33.600 --> 11:42.560
um, like maybe, maybe a few months, like half a year now and nothing happened. And then suddenly I was just like, oh, I'm allergic.

11:43.520 --> 11:57.120
And then, oh, so today I walked around the, I walked around the neighborhood and then I had, I had a thought, the, does, does

11:58.400 --> 12:01.520
senpai's play ping pong because I'm palm?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
Question, is that the reason?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.800
It is now.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.760
I withhold my answer. Oh, senpai's naughty.

12:29.760 --> 12:34.800
Kohai, what did you have for dinner today? I had a ham and cheese sandwich.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.600
This morning I had pho.

12:43.520 --> 12:54.960
I didn't see anything. You didn't play anything at all. Oh, yeah, not anything at all. Not that I see the paddles everywhere or the nets hidden under one of your beds.

12:54.960 --> 13:04.240
I know everything I see. Oh, this, my, this bang hides my third eye. That hides the Gigan eye.

13:13.520 --> 13:22.160
What bed? The doggie bed! The doggie bed in the haze!

13:27.360 --> 13:31.920
You get doggie beds. I put a little stuffed animal in there. It's a little pillow.

13:43.360 --> 13:54.000
Excuse me. It's starting to get really cold, so I'm being affected by the weather.

14:02.160 --> 14:10.240
But um, as a warning though, my arm still heats up even though the rash is like pretty much like really,

14:11.120 --> 14:14.720
it's still like 40% still there. Tea check?

14:16.480 --> 14:21.200
Today's tea is pomegranate green tea. I wanted to stay awake for senpai's.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.080
We would never lie to our precious Kohai.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.800
Says a liar.

14:29.920 --> 14:38.160
Word of the day, um, contingency. Like a plan. Like, what you,

14:38.160 --> 14:48.080
what senpai's need? A contingency plan.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.480
Okay, let's talk to the people.

15:17.920 --> 15:25.040
Also, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about yesterday. I put the days wrong.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.600
Do you know what mama and papa always say to me?

15:31.600 --> 15:39.280
They always go, merci! You're so clumsy. Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.040
Mama, mama always gets mad at me.

15:48.560 --> 15:54.080
Because when I have a button-up shirt or like a cardigan, I always miss one button. So the,

15:54.080 --> 15:56.880
so it's like, the buttons are always wrong.

16:02.000 --> 16:14.080
So I was like, oh, so when I told them like, yeah, I made the days wrong. So I have to go down and

16:14.080 --> 16:22.160
tell, tell everyone that, that it's the wrong day. They're like, of course, of course you did.

16:22.160 --> 16:33.440
I spent the day looking for a matching alchemy model, kid. Oh,

16:33.440 --> 16:36.720
is the senpai's want to have a matching alchemy model?

16:39.520 --> 16:43.600
Yeah, it's, it's, it's a really, it's really fast. I built it in like,

16:44.240 --> 16:48.000
maybe 10 minutes, maybe less than that, five minutes. I suffered the one time where I made a

16:48.000 --> 16:52.720
mistake and then I had to poke, poke one in the mouth again because I forgot to put the strawberry in.

16:56.640 --> 17:02.000
But I really like alchemy. It was like my first, when I was playing Pokemon

17:02.560 --> 17:07.120
Sword and Shield. Oh, which one do I have? I think I have Shield. Yeah. Um,

17:08.640 --> 17:15.680
oh, when I have Sword and, Sword and Shield, it was the first Gigantamax Pokemon I got.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.280
So I was like, yeah.

17:23.440 --> 17:28.320
What's your favorite alchemy variation? The original one, because that's the one I got.

17:29.520 --> 17:38.960
My alchemy is named Milfyu after the Galaxy Angel character. If you know Galaxy Angel.

17:39.280 --> 17:49.600
The key to the spirit's grudge. It should be within each elementary. Oh, sorry, I was supposed to do voices.

17:53.200 --> 17:59.920
It should be within each elementary. Fate has tied him to that school. However, even I do not

18:00.560 --> 18:02.080
know what form it will take.

18:02.800 --> 18:08.160
My favorite Pokemon is Mimikyu.

18:11.280 --> 18:18.080
Mimikyu is a, is a dangerous Pokemon. I really liked Galaxy Angel because it was the first

18:18.960 --> 18:23.680
DVD I ever had for like an anime series.

18:24.080 --> 18:43.280
Hey, wait, Mashita appears as we're getting ready to leave. Bad news.

18:43.600 --> 18:58.560
Oh, my favorite Pokemon used to be Vaporeon until, until the copy pasta. And then I, I had a less

18:58.560 --> 19:02.880
respect. I had a less liking to Vaporeon.

19:03.280 --> 19:18.400
But I, I can tell you mama and papa's favorite Pokemon, mama's favorite Pokemon is a Lapras.

19:18.400 --> 19:25.120
Which I, I don't know about you senpai, but I feel like Lapras is a very mommy Pokemon.

19:25.120 --> 19:31.920
So when she chose that, I was like, oh, somehow this is so, this is very suitable for you,

19:31.920 --> 19:43.040
mommy. And papa and my sister's favorite is Snorlax.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.040
But yeah, when mama, mama picked Lapras, I was like,

19:55.440 --> 20:01.840
ah, this is, this is like a very, this is very suitable for mama.

20:10.080 --> 20:16.320
But like, they also really like Pikachu. I think that's the only one they actually know the name of.

20:16.320 --> 20:26.880
It's the only one they actually know the name of. But like, if I gave them like a picture of like

20:26.880 --> 20:31.600
Pokemons, mama picked out Lapras and she was like, yeah, this one's my favorite.

20:32.240 --> 20:36.240
And papa picked out Snorlax and my sister also was like, I like Snorlax.

20:36.880 --> 20:42.720
Imagine if papa chose Vaporeon.

20:45.760 --> 20:50.320
Even if he did, I would not tell senpais. I would not tell senpais, but he did it.

20:56.880 --> 21:01.360
That high school girl. It's Molly, it's gone.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.800
Damn.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.960
At least she's nowhere in the mansion.

21:15.920 --> 21:20.080
Speaking of which, I didn't see her when we were talking to Mary in the hall either.

21:23.520 --> 21:27.520
Maybe she ran away. That doesn't make sense.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.280
What would she accomplish by doing that?

21:33.200 --> 21:36.080
Running away from the mansion won't make her mark disappear.

21:38.800 --> 21:42.960
It could be her form of escape. Many kill themselves if they know they're gonna die.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.400
Okay, okay, Mr. Detective Guy.

21:48.400 --> 21:58.160
I maybe something happened to her like the spirit's curse.

22:01.360 --> 22:06.720
Molly saw Hannah Hickel in the mirror at the school. So she's the mark bearer with the strongest

22:06.720 --> 22:15.520
connection. It's possible that he zeroed in on her just like Tsukasa said. But there's nothing we can do.

22:18.560 --> 22:23.520
Let's get ready to go. Yeah, we really can't do anything right now.

22:24.480 --> 22:30.080
Even if something happened to Molly, if we can get the mark to vanish, I should save her too.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.040
Let's head out. We're going back to H Elementary.

22:38.720 --> 22:45.520
Let's go back, senpai. Back to the beginning. Does anyone get that reference? Come on.

22:48.720 --> 23:02.720
Yeah, yeah, this is your mom movie. You come back to H Elementary.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.720
Senpais are so smart. I'm so proud of Senpai.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.720
I knew for a while that in the end this place is just a school.

23:16.720 --> 23:22.800
Well, an abandoned school with a monster in it. And you know, the security card probably just died.

23:27.040 --> 23:33.440
Oh yeah, and there's like killer plants in there. Oh, and a bunch of poisonous snakes. So not exactly normal.

23:40.640 --> 23:45.760
Let's go. Tsukasa nods silently and steps forward.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.280
Wait, did I go with the kid?

23:54.240 --> 24:00.320
Oh yeah, I went with the kid because I was like, oh well, adults, they'll fucking die, right?

24:02.480 --> 24:03.280
Okay, let's go in.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.120
Okay, let's see. Examine.

24:10.720 --> 24:15.280
Anything new? What's in the shoe locker? The battered shoe rack is covered in dirt.

24:16.960 --> 24:23.360
Okay, disintegrated stuff. Okay, okay. I want to go to the left this time.

24:28.560 --> 24:36.480
We saw it earlier, but look at all these flowers. Roses are red, violets are blue.

24:37.040 --> 24:48.960
We saw it. The hallway has completely transformed. Seeing them like this.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.160
Are roses on that pretty? When you look close, they're scary.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.840
Huh? Uh-huh. What's that?

25:00.960 --> 25:03.360
Tsukasa suddenly speaks up. There.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.600
By the window. Hey, over there, something's sparkling.

25:09.760 --> 25:13.440
The window? I see her rose vines. I may as well check it out though.

25:16.400 --> 25:22.640
Oh, there it is. Something's glinting over by the window.

25:23.360 --> 25:27.920
Looks like something's buried in the rose vines. It's definitely something there.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.280
Sorry, I'm coughing.

25:36.080 --> 25:40.320
I didn't notice it before. No, maybe it wasn't there yet when we passed through here earlier.

25:41.440 --> 25:47.360
A guard from before. Did he drop that? Maybe. He might have fallen on the floor and been

25:47.360 --> 25:53.760
lifted up by the vines. It's only now that it's high enough to be spotted.

25:54.960 --> 25:58.400
If it belonged to the guard, then it could come in handy while we're investigating.

25:59.200 --> 26:03.040
He's in charge of watching this building after all. Let's check it out.

26:05.440 --> 26:12.400
Feel it. Oh, what if I cut myself though? I pushed my fingers into the vines. Ow!

26:13.360 --> 26:17.120
I was careful, but oddly shaped thorns still cut my skin.

26:17.760 --> 26:23.680
Damn, this is a pain. I keep fighting with the vines. I finally reached the metal object.

26:24.560 --> 26:32.000
Got school curing! Yeah, make sure to hydrate. Okay. It is a little cold here, Senpai.

26:32.480 --> 26:44.880
So, I might, I might be coughing because it's cold. It's been raining a lot.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.520
Yep, just as we thought. These definitely belong to the guards.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.600
These would be extremely useful. You can get into places we...

26:56.640 --> 27:00.240
The castle suddenly cuts off mid-sentence. What's wrong?

27:01.200 --> 27:05.680
Nothing. I just forgot what I was saying. Anyway, let's keep looking around.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.360
Need info was added to spirit file. Continued investigation of the school.

27:13.360 --> 27:17.360
Huh.

27:17.520 --> 27:24.720
Maybe... I know that the kid doesn't like an adult, but I feel so uncomfortable bringing your kid around.

27:25.360 --> 27:30.480
You know? I feel so uncomfortable bringing a tiny tot.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.920
A tiny tot around with me. Maybe I should go back and grab the guy?

27:41.840 --> 27:43.600
I'm gonna go back and grab the guy.

27:44.320 --> 27:55.360
Maybe he should stay with the creepy doll girl.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.400
I don't know. I'm just like...

28:01.840 --> 28:09.040
Also, you know, kids are very... I don't know. I feel like the detective might have a gun,

28:09.040 --> 28:14.800
and that might come in handy. But also... Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna go back.

28:16.960 --> 28:17.680
I'm gonna go back.

28:21.920 --> 28:26.320
Don't fucking do that. Don't fucking do that, gay. I hate kids.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.680
I mean, kid's laughter. Stranny!

28:39.600 --> 28:44.480
Eyeball. Let's take...

28:47.840 --> 28:51.920
Stranny raid! Welcome, Stranny! Welcome to the stream! Welcome raiders! How was...

28:52.880 --> 28:58.720
the hat game... link... the hat game? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

29:00.480 --> 29:03.040
I was watching a bit of it, and I was like, oh, it's so cute!

29:03.120 --> 29:09.840
Turns out, I'm MLG on Zelda and did the boss first time. Nice!

29:11.520 --> 29:15.760
Well, welcome, everyone. Today, I am playing Deathmark.

29:18.480 --> 29:24.800
It's a visual novel, horror-ish game with quick time events and

29:27.120 --> 29:31.200
choices and some movements. So, if you like this,

29:31.520 --> 29:33.280
let's play.

29:36.320 --> 29:41.840
Okay, now we'll return to HLM entry, because I'm just like, I don't know! I don't like bringing a kid

29:41.840 --> 29:51.440
with me! There you go. Spooky spooky. Okay, all in favor to go left? I'm going left.

29:51.440 --> 30:05.680
Okay, I use the school key ring and open the door. Yeah! Son of a bitch!

30:22.160 --> 30:34.640
This is why we're like, I don't like kids, generally.

30:36.880 --> 30:42.640
Did that get a senpai's? Child jumpscare.

30:45.840 --> 30:49.520
Did that get senpai's too? Because my heart dropped for a second.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.160
Okay, let's, uh, look.

31:05.360 --> 31:09.040
The aluminum chalk case has dents all over it, as if something hit it.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.960
Eel. Something's inside the chalk case.

31:14.160 --> 31:19.280
Found a worn-out talisman, and I pick up the worn-out talisman. I feel warmth flow through me!

31:22.400 --> 31:30.160
My heart died for a moment. I got used to it. I was like, ah, I forgot the jump scares.

31:30.880 --> 31:36.000
Got soap power. Yeah, the worn-out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

31:36.880 --> 31:41.200
Let's check out this really dirty aquarium.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.400
Look, and glass is terribly stained, making it impossible to see inside.

31:52.400 --> 32:00.400
I touch it. I hesitantly stick my hand in the tank. When I do, my fingers touch something cold.

32:00.400 --> 32:06.560
There's water left inside. Just water. For some reason, Mashita looks disappointed.

32:07.760 --> 32:12.240
Of course. There's enough water left inside that I could scoop it up if I had a container.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.160
I do have a container!

32:14.320 --> 32:19.680
I do have a container! I have... this plastic bottle! Yeah!

32:20.960 --> 32:25.680
I take the plastic bottle out and put it in the tank. It gurgles as it fills with water.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.280
Got bottle of water.

32:32.480 --> 32:41.680
Or, as some people say, oh!

32:44.320 --> 32:51.120
What are you gonna do with it? I don't know! I want it! Why? If I can use it, I want it!

32:52.720 --> 32:57.920
Okay, let's look. When you open an umbrella in a typhoon, it will break because the wind's too strong.

32:58.560 --> 33:03.840
So first, I tried to put holes in an umbrella. The way... that way, it wouldn't break a strong wind.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.880
And who would those people be? Hmm?

33:14.880 --> 33:15.600
The British.

33:26.160 --> 33:31.520
Oh my gosh! Okay, I think I need to put on a sweater, Senpai.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.080
I think I need to put on a sweater, Senpai.

33:44.560 --> 33:54.480
British jumpscare. A bit too chilly. Yeah, it's super cold!

33:57.040 --> 33:58.720
I think that's why I'm coughing a lot.

34:03.760 --> 34:08.880
I think that's why I'm coughing a lot because I'm gonna wear this cardigan.

34:08.880 --> 34:14.160
Yeah, I always have a cardigan with me.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.160
And... Blake it up!

34:26.560 --> 34:33.440
It's super hot here. If I had to choose between hot versus cold, I would choose cold.

34:33.520 --> 34:41.040
I can be under many layers, but I cannot strip more.

34:47.200 --> 34:51.760
Okay, I cannot remove the skin.

34:54.880 --> 34:55.680
I don't know why.

34:55.840 --> 35:02.640
Um, Stroni was wearing a sweater and nothing else.

35:07.920 --> 35:08.560
Oh my!

35:12.240 --> 35:15.920
Who let you remove our skin, Kohei? Really? You'd let me do that?

35:18.480 --> 35:24.720
You would let... you'd let me do that, Senpai? You let me tear your skin off?

35:26.320 --> 35:31.760
No, when using it, put a plastic sheet on it to transform it into an extra strong umbrella.

35:32.400 --> 35:36.400
A strengthened umbrella protects from thorns or branches blown by the wind.

35:37.520 --> 35:42.240
Okay, if I... that's a hint. Yes, that's how kids think.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.040
He acts like he was never a kid himself.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.720
What? No, it's nothing.

35:56.640 --> 35:58.480
Anything else here? We looked there.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.400
I think we already looked here.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.040
Uh, did we?

36:10.240 --> 36:12.880
Anything else? Sparkle.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.600
Now, okay, we're good. Let's get out of here.

36:26.160 --> 36:29.600
Oh my gosh, I misaligned the buttons again!

36:36.240 --> 36:41.600
Okay, there I go.

36:45.680 --> 36:46.000
Okay.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.960
We already went there, it looks like, I think.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.800
Okay, move forward!

37:06.480 --> 37:09.680
The broken window is letting in piercing cold wind. Okay.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.080
What's that?

37:12.960 --> 37:16.000
The rain coming in from the broken window is making the floor cold and damp.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.880
Are we at the end of the hall? I found you, kid!

37:28.880 --> 37:29.520
Fucking kids.

37:31.840 --> 37:32.720
Climb the stairs.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.840
Anything around here?

37:43.120 --> 37:46.160
Pieces of concrete litter the floor. I think they came from the walls.

37:56.480 --> 38:02.080
Ah, that's why it's cold. Yeah, climb the stairs.

38:03.840 --> 38:07.040
Plies in the snakes cover the hallway. I'd be foolish to keep going.

38:08.560 --> 38:15.440
I decided to go back to the landing. Okay, let's go back down then. Let's go back down.

38:16.000 --> 38:25.440
Can we go in here already? I don't know if we can go in here already.

38:27.040 --> 38:31.040
Oh yeah, we did. We're out of here. I explored the heck out of that place.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.200
How many snakes do you need to cover a staircase? A lot!

38:39.440 --> 38:46.880
For one really big one. Wait, go back.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.160
Did I ever look at this?

39:00.480 --> 39:04.800
Look, the light on alarm is very faint. Something might be wrong with it.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.760
I open up and shine the flashlight to see if there's anything inside.

39:10.720 --> 39:15.440
Found a worn-out talisman. When I picked up the worn-out talisman, I feel warmth flow through me.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.040
Got soul power.

39:23.040 --> 39:26.560
The worn-out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

39:35.760 --> 39:39.200
There we go. What is soul power for?

39:42.560 --> 39:43.760
Give me a moment, Senpai.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.600
When you do quick time events and you do the wrong,

39:53.440 --> 40:04.640
in each moment, you lose a soul power. So when you lose soul power and it hits zero, you die.

40:05.760 --> 40:09.200
So these worn-out talismans look like they recover that.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.640
Did I go in here already? Yeah, I already went in here.

40:17.440 --> 40:23.360
So help, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Senpai. Yeah, you're so smart, Senpai.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.840
I don't think we went into this room. Use the school key ring and open the door.

40:31.840 --> 40:36.080
I move to step into the classroom.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.920
And suddenly there's a strong grip on my shoulder.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.680
I glance at the hallway out of the corner of my eye.

40:46.320 --> 40:49.120
I'm pretty sure Mashita was on my other side.

40:49.760 --> 40:53.280
No, even if they were on this side, they would have no reason to grab me.

40:54.560 --> 40:58.000
Ah, here it is! Senpai, live or die.

40:58.880 --> 41:06.160
Calm down, I'm just imagining things. My voice doesn't sound very convincing.

41:09.120 --> 41:12.080
Don't panic, it's an illusion. Calm down, hold it together.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.280
And I see Chou enveloped my right side.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.440
I have 3,000 soul power, something's gripping my shoulder.

41:20.080 --> 41:20.880
Oh.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.000
Is that you? Is that you, Mashita?

41:27.440 --> 41:30.000
I turn Mashita and open my mouth to tell them.

41:30.960 --> 41:31.840
One, two, ah!

41:36.960 --> 41:37.460
Safe.

41:42.400 --> 41:46.880
I see a terrifying face in the darkness. Yeah, kids are pretty terrifying, huh?

41:47.840 --> 41:49.920
Kids are terrifying creatures.

41:54.880 --> 41:59.360
And then an outline laying in wait for me.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.640
Oh no, oh no, oh no, what should I do? What should I do?

42:07.760 --> 42:11.440
Uh, I'mma close my eyes! Fuck, close my eyes! Fuck!

42:14.000 --> 42:14.800
Go light, go light!

42:17.680 --> 42:20.400
Excuse my eyes, shut and pray.

42:21.920 --> 42:29.120
Safe! Oh yeah! I knew it, if I, I knew it, I knew, I knew if I said something I'm probably gonna

42:29.120 --> 42:34.480
die because this kid hates adults, right? This ghost kid hates adults. So if they hear a deep

42:34.480 --> 42:44.240
voice they'll be like, oh my gosh, it's an adult, die! Just then. Hey, what's wrong?

42:47.120 --> 42:53.920
With Mashita's voice, the figure vanishes. I find myself standing in front of the door.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.480
Survive. Woo!

43:02.960 --> 43:09.600
The mark burns scarlet. Dawn, half an hour left until death closes in.

43:11.200 --> 43:15.280
We are gonna disregard time because I'm gonna spend a few more hours playing.

43:17.200 --> 43:24.400
You okay? Yeah!

43:27.200 --> 43:32.880
Mashita picked something off my left shoulder. This is...

43:34.960 --> 43:38.560
The hand I felt gripping my shoulder was actually a rose thorn.

43:38.880 --> 43:51.680
But more importantly, Mashita, what's the matter? You're acting kind of... acting kind of what?

43:53.680 --> 43:55.440
Something's wrong, he's not acting normal.

43:57.200 --> 44:02.800
Amnesia, my heart pangs with worry. Is Mashita spacing out because the mark's curse has progressed?

44:03.760 --> 44:09.200
But I don't understand. I'm still the same, at least as far as I know.

44:12.560 --> 44:20.320
Come on, hurt right. Mashita shuffles forward like a zombie. Something is seriously wrong.

44:21.520 --> 44:28.320
Bad. Danger kept on us so quickly for running out of time. This condition might get worse.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.320
I'll figure something out.

44:33.600 --> 44:40.960
Okay, here we go. What's that? A white powder substance scattered around. Look.

44:42.240 --> 44:47.920
A coarse powder, a glitters in the glow of the flashlight. Is it, is it cocaine?

44:54.240 --> 45:00.480
I'm not really inclined to sticking it in my mouth to make sure, but it's probably so. Oh, okay.

45:03.600 --> 45:10.720
Okay, it's salt. If I had a container, I'd take some with me. I do have a container. I have...

45:15.760 --> 45:21.280
Ball water. My powder seems to be salt. Take out the bottle of water and fill it with powder.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.040
Oh, it's salt water.

45:24.000 --> 45:34.960
First purify with sea water. Yeah. I hear that voice again. Sea water. So that would be salt water, then?

45:36.320 --> 45:39.200
Oh, hi. I can't read Japanese. What does this say?

45:40.640 --> 45:46.240
Hey, hey. Oh, that's a lot of words I can't read. I can't read.

45:49.200 --> 45:51.360
The plants are dry and withered.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.920
Say, say, I can't read. I can't read.

46:03.440 --> 46:06.960
Knee, knee, no, no.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.680
Something about your car is extended warranty, probably.

46:13.840 --> 46:20.400
Then say, could I? Oh, I hate teacher. Fair.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.480
Fair.

46:26.320 --> 46:32.480
I hate sensei. Got it. There are six office ladies who ride my train. I observed them for 10 days.

46:37.040 --> 46:42.240
So true. When I was a kid, I was like, I don't like my teachers.

46:42.960 --> 46:50.400
I learned popular colors are brown and pink. Everyone's hair is brown and their mouths are pink.

46:55.040 --> 47:00.320
Feel it. Paper is falling apart. Got anyone who would care if I tore it off and took it with me.

47:00.960 --> 47:02.480
Wait, I can take these?

47:03.200 --> 47:12.800
I need to go back to the other room. I totally needed to grab those things.

47:15.280 --> 47:19.840
Look. Experiment. I poured different liquids on the weed in my yard to see which was effective.

47:19.840 --> 47:20.320
Results?

47:21.360 --> 47:25.840
C. Miso soup and D. Salt water work. Conclusion. Salt can destroy weeds.

47:26.640 --> 47:31.600
Solving salt in water first makes it easier for the plants to absorb and speed the effects.

47:32.160 --> 47:32.720
Understood.

47:37.600 --> 47:42.000
We'll take that as well. These are hints. We're going to go back and grab the other stuff.

47:42.880 --> 47:47.920
Miso soup, yeah. Anything else? Oh, there's something on the ceiling.

47:48.800 --> 47:51.520
Does the roof have a leak? The ceiling looks stained in places.

47:56.240 --> 48:00.080
Anything else? I'm having this plant thing.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.280
Oops. I didn't mean to do that.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.200
I'm going to go back.

48:19.840 --> 48:24.480
I'm going to go back because clearly we needed that one thing.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.880
I'm going to grab those hints I saw.

48:30.960 --> 48:33.760
Is it this one? Yeah, it was this one. I'm going to grab them.

48:35.680 --> 48:41.920
Eel. Yeah, take it. Take it. Take it. Take it.

48:44.720 --> 48:51.120
Miso has a lot of sodium. Oh, yeah, that's true. I like Miso soup. I like the kelp one.

48:51.840 --> 48:57.680
I plan to strengthen weeds. I'm going to take this one, too.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.200
I'm going to take that one, too. Thank you.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.880
Umbrella that withstands typhoon.

49:08.400 --> 49:13.600
We didn't find an umbrella before, did we? Oh, wait, hold on. It's a bed and desk. Look.

49:14.320 --> 49:17.920
Yes, you'll find it at any other school. What's surprising? It doesn't look very weathered.

49:18.480 --> 49:20.800
So that goes to show how durable school desks are.

49:22.160 --> 49:27.280
Deal it. Stick my hand inside and feel around. Something pokes my finger. I grab it and pull

49:27.280 --> 49:35.360
it out. Is it the umbrella thing? Yeah! What's it doing here? I have an idea. This umbrella might

49:35.360 --> 49:38.720
have been part of the display for the independent research we found earlier.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.560
Oh, though, what's the point? I'm going to use it.

49:42.880 --> 49:49.920
I see the nicely folded dark plastic sheet amongst the garbage. Take it, too.

49:52.320 --> 49:57.920
Their blood denies them. Denies them. Put it together and what have you got?

50:00.480 --> 50:05.920
That conscious thought, I start speaking. Blood denies them. Does that mean repel with blood?

50:05.920 --> 50:14.640
I pop open the wire umbrella and I spread the plastic sheet over it.

50:16.640 --> 50:20.000
Huh, just like it says in the research paper, you can create something like an umbrella.

50:20.800 --> 50:24.640
But it's not fast and dawn. It'll be impossible to carry it around like this.

50:25.360 --> 50:30.400
But we'll have to hold it together to use it. Thankfully, there are two of us here. One person

50:30.400 --> 50:34.720
to open the umbrella first and one person to spread the sheet. If you manage to combo like that,

50:34.720 --> 50:40.720
we can use the blood stain sheet as an umbrella. Sorry to make you wait.

50:41.760 --> 50:46.800
Right. Ashita gives a big reply. I'm sure it'll come in handy.

50:48.960 --> 50:54.640
I feel like everything is here for a reason. New info was added to the spirit file. Blood stain,

50:54.640 --> 51:03.440
umbrella. Okay, okay. We found the umbrella. I was like, okay, clearly we have something.

51:04.240 --> 51:14.880
Uh, let's turn back and head this away. Where was I before? I think I was close to the end, right?

51:20.880 --> 51:27.680
Anything else here? No more ugly kids? I don't think I have this ever open. Fire doors,

51:27.760 --> 51:30.720
rested shut and won't move. Okay, that's probably useless then.

51:33.440 --> 51:34.240
Climb the stairs.

51:37.520 --> 51:41.280
Halfway up the stairs, I chip on something. What's this?

51:43.600 --> 51:45.520
Moe's bag is on the staircase.

51:48.800 --> 51:54.240
Got Moe's bag. Inside the bag is some random junk along with her school jacket.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.240
If it's here, that means...

52:00.640 --> 52:02.000
Is Moe still in the school?

52:05.200 --> 52:08.480
But a cracked mirror is the only thing in sight.

52:09.120 --> 52:11.840
If it's counting her bag, there's no trace of Moe anywhere.

52:13.040 --> 52:14.800
In any case, we'll just have to keep looking around.

52:15.840 --> 52:16.640
Isn't I looking now?

52:18.960 --> 52:23.760
Look, it's a crack. There's cracks in the mirror. There's nothing else particularly odd about it.

52:24.560 --> 52:29.360
Ew, my finger down the cracks. Mash it to watch as me wordly, but nothing happens.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.000
Going to go up now?

52:39.760 --> 52:41.680
Climb the stairs. I think we grabbed everything.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.920
Twice in a snake's cover the hallway. Be foolish to try to keep going.

52:47.360 --> 52:49.520
All right, we decide to go back to the landing.

52:50.480 --> 52:55.920
Okay, well, anything else?

52:57.360 --> 53:00.640
Well, do we have her bag? Oops.

53:04.560 --> 53:05.520
Went down the stairs.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.560
Am I missing something?

53:15.840 --> 53:18.080
The broken window is letting piercingly cold air in.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.480
Okay, hold on. Well, we're going to explore some more.

53:21.760 --> 53:25.040
Part of these motherfucking snakes in my motherfucking school.

53:26.640 --> 53:30.000
Okay, I think we checked everything here. We got the salt.

53:42.480 --> 53:45.520
I was hoping to use the salt on it, but I guess I don't need it.

53:48.880 --> 53:51.440
I don't think I need it.

53:58.320 --> 54:02.960
My tonight is, I think, everything in this room.

54:04.800 --> 54:08.960
The dust is so thick on the ceiling that just walking around causes showers of particles.

54:08.960 --> 54:14.000
That's unsafe and unsanitary. I wonder this school is abandoned.

54:18.240 --> 54:21.840
Anything around here?

54:25.840 --> 54:28.240
Ceiling is filthy and the fluorescent lights are broken.

54:35.600 --> 54:38.960
Wait, warning and contacts. Fire-containing warnings and list of contacts.

54:41.200 --> 54:43.600
Do not leave handprints on the mirror in the eastern stairway.

54:43.600 --> 54:46.160
Thank you, Independent Research Presentation, First Floor,

54:46.240 --> 54:47.840
Multi-Purpose Classroom. Come check it out.

54:48.640 --> 54:50.640
Independent Research, huh? Okay.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.520
Uh, deal?

54:58.080 --> 54:59.600
Don't find anything in particular.

55:03.520 --> 55:03.760
Okay.

55:08.880 --> 55:12.160
Mercy, can I say how attractive you are? Sempais loves you. Mwah!

55:12.160 --> 55:13.840
And I love you, Sempai. Mwah!

55:16.960 --> 55:19.760
I swear I went through everything. Did I not go through everything?

55:23.760 --> 55:24.480
Okay, hold on.

55:31.680 --> 55:35.040
What does this say? I can't read this either.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.520
There's nonsensical scribbles on the blackboard.

55:47.120 --> 55:52.960
The dust is so thick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, same thing.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.520
Okay, so we're going to assume everything on the ceiling.

55:58.720 --> 56:02.080
Can you do anything with Moe's bag? Here, let me check my bag first.

56:05.680 --> 56:08.640
Oh, I can power Intelligence 11.

56:10.320 --> 56:12.560
Okay, Dexterity 11, Dexterity 6.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.920
What's this? Oh, that's the spirit file.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.880
I have a flare, plastic sheet, school key ring,

56:22.880 --> 56:26.400
a food umbrella, wire umbrella, Moe's bag.

56:30.080 --> 56:32.480
Some textbooks and items of unknown purposes.

56:35.040 --> 56:37.760
Oh, she's in the school! Somewhere, right?

56:37.760 --> 56:42.400
Okay, she might be in that room again.

56:45.600 --> 56:48.720
A wall near the window is burnt. There must have been a fire here a long time ago.

56:51.040 --> 56:54.560
And the door in left the staff room. In here?

56:58.560 --> 57:01.760
Open the glass door and check inside, but there isn't anything that catches my eye.

57:01.760 --> 57:10.080
There's an entrance to the underground room. Go to the underground room.

57:12.160 --> 57:14.880
Shall we go in there again? Yeah.

57:19.280 --> 57:20.480
Is there anything else in here?

57:23.280 --> 57:27.520
Right up corpse. Look, body is twisted in odd position as if still in pain even now.

57:28.240 --> 57:31.600
Heal it, hesitantly search the corpse, but I don't find anything.

57:34.640 --> 57:42.160
Okay, well, the bad room. Yeah, the bad room full of stuff that happened badly.

57:42.880 --> 57:44.160
I'm checking through all of them, though.

57:45.760 --> 57:50.400
Look, body is twisted in odd position, blah, blah, blah. Okay, touch it.

57:51.360 --> 57:56.880
Okay, find anything about you. Touch it.

58:05.120 --> 58:07.440
Okay, we got something. I hesitantly searched the corpse.

58:08.240 --> 58:15.600
Something flashes within the vine by its feet. Got round hand mirror. Like a gift for a young woman.

58:16.320 --> 58:25.200
Mark has died in deep crimson. A few minutes left until death closes in.

58:26.320 --> 58:30.320
Shit! A loud noise suddenly rings out.

58:33.120 --> 58:36.560
A terrible pain runs through my wrist. It feels like something's biting into my bone.

58:36.640 --> 58:43.600
Ashita? Hey, are you listening? Yeah, I can hear you.

58:46.240 --> 58:50.240
At least he's still replying to me. So, what the way he's acting is.

58:51.520 --> 58:53.680
Can't keep going like this. Move, come on.

58:54.800 --> 58:59.680
Shout rings through the building. New info was added to spirit file. Last hand.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.480
Am I gonna fucking die now?

59:06.560 --> 59:21.680
Oh well. R.I.P.

59:29.200 --> 59:32.480
I'm getting, I'm guessing that's the titular death mark? Yeah.

59:33.280 --> 59:38.400
Instant I step into the hallway. A strange, indescribable feeling hits me.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.600
Like a solid presence is closing in on me from deep within the darkness.

59:44.960 --> 59:51.680
A router appears out of nowhere. And it runs down the hallway. I thought that was it,

59:51.680 --> 59:55.040
but it stopped the part way. Grim's back is left to see what we're doing.

59:55.760 --> 59:59.360
Hey, wait up. I grabbed Ashita's wrist and chased after it.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:06.400
We chase after the rabbit and we arrive at eastern staircase.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.520
We quickly climb up the stairs and stand in front of the mirror.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.920
Heard it. I look around for the creature.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.680
Just then, red drops of something fall from above.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.800
Scarlet rose petals.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:31.360
I slowly raise my eyes up to the ceiling.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.720
The instant I see that, I let out a groan.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.240
Okay, over fine. It's fine.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.680
It's heavily weighted with both fear and relief.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.680
Snippets, don't look!

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.480
Moe is up there, hanging from rose vines.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.040
It's her. He points at her, strangely amused.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.120
But she's not the only one up there.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.640
It's a corpse hiding in the vines, too. It looks like the guard.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.920
Suddenly, the vines snap like the weight is too much.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.160
Moe crashes painfully up to the ground.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.920
Hey, hang in there!

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.880
Yeah. I quickly glance over her to make sure she's not hurt.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.720
The mark is obvious. It's swollen, pulsing, red like a giant.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.360
Like a large, dangerous-looking pomegranate.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.880
It looks like it progressed a lot further than the mark on my wrist.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.960
See, so this is why.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.320
Did she get desperate and come to the school to try to do something?

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.800
She did run away.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.560
In any case, I need to get some clothes on her.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.560
Take the jacket out of her bag and slide her arm into a sleeve.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.400
She's still pretty out of it, but she manages to get a rest on by herself.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.320
Huh? Oh, it's you, mister! Why?

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.960
The mark's progression must be affecting her, just like Mashita.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.120
I doubt anything that I would say will make sense to her.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.640
Besides, right now...

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:19.920
He's here.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.760
And uh, Niko is.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.760
I know, but what should I do? What am I supposed to do?

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.160
There's nowhere to hide.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.560
I look at Moe and Mashita, their eyes are unfocused.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.120
We'll die here. We'll all die here.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.680
I'm the only one who might have a chance of overturning that fate.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.320
Gaining the key and letting the grudge befall me by to survive.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.960
You'll be required to be callous to make the escape of the spirit appear.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.480
The way to repel the spirit hides within its grudge.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.720
Mary's words echo in my head.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.400
I open my bag and look through everything I picked up throughout the school.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.880
It's one of these, the key, but it all looks like junk!

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get through this.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.320
Garbage is all I have.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.320
And Niko.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.160
My first saw him in this mirror, he was just a monster.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.480
Now I feel like I know why he came to be.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.520
I just have to face him.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.280
Believe that I have the final key.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:32.800
Believe.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.400
Trust in myself.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.440
Who's the partner?

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.800
Uh, we're gonna choose the girl!

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.520
Cause uh, Moe, Moe, Moe!

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.920
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.880
I grab them, shake their shoulder and yell.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.720
Get it together!

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.920
There's nowhere to hide!

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.600
We have to go!

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.640
Come with me!

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.280
Hanna Hiko.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.800
Uh, because Hanna Hiko hates adults.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.280
Moe, Moe, Q?

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.600
Moe, Moe, Q?

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.160
Moe makes a big sound.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.880
That's good enough.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.320
We're going to release him from his curse!

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.080
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.640
Listen here, kid.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.080
Okay, listen here, you- oh, okay.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.320
Hanna Hiko is staring at Moe.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.000
Hey, they aren't a grown-up.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:40.480
I knew it!

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:40.960
I knew it!

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.360
I knew it!

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.600
Fine, only big people die, okay?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.920
Sound like slithering vines come from Hanna Hiko's direction.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.080
That's gross.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.120
Okay, okay.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.160
So, okay.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.280
Review, review our notes, Senpai, before we continue.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.760
Review our notes.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.120
We have the weed, the plant destroyer,

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:25.600
and then we have the thing with the- that can stop thorns.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.080
We're good.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.760
That's salt water.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.320
We got the thorn thingy that will protect us,

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.760
and we got the red stuff.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the umbrella.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:37.600
We got them.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.080
We got it.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:38.560
We got it.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:50.480
The next thing I know, a sharp- small sharp object raises my face.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.320
Missed.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.920
You won't be so lucky next time.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.120
I get the feeling Hanna Hiko's planning to attack me from a distance.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.520
I need to do something to reach him from this far away.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.080
Facing a spirit.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:13.040
To defeat a spirit, you must use the item right to item at the right time.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.440
Okay, we got- we got this.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.120
Both you and your partner can use one item each.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.920
Choose according to the situation.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.840
Okay, let's use the umbrella to protect us first.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.600
Item usage limit.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.720
Some items are limited use, so please take care.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.320
Check the number to the right.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.160
Also, some items cannot be used when facing a spirit.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:52.160
By the way, when did you last say uh at the mansion?

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.720
Combo actions.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.680
When facing a spirit, two items can be used together.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.120
This is a combo action.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:11.840
It is executed if you and your partner use the right items.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.160
Did I use- do I- okay, we have the umbrella, right?

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.880
So do we need to use the tarp and the umbrella at the same time,

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.200
or do we already have that kind of made?

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.320
I can't remember.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.920
I can't remember if I did that or not.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.680
I think we've already made it, right?

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.960
But someone has to hold it.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.320
I'll figure it out.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.160
It works as a combo?

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.160
You think it works as a combo?

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.320
Okay, we'll probably have to use the combo then.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.560
Strategy hint.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.840
You can read the spirit file or item descriptions at any time.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.200
Open your bag using Y.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.840
Okay, well.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.680
You use- okay, oh yeah, it has to be used as together.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.080
Wire umbrella.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.080
Uh, a six sheet.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.720
Yes, yes, yes.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.320
The umbrella and then the plastic sheet.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:35.600
Yes.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.360
I put the plastic sheet over the wire umbrella.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.040
I ready to cobble together an umbrella.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.720
This should be able to block the thorns.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.040
What the heck is that?

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.800
That umbrella, he's in my way.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.680
His cold voice rings out,

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.880
sounding slightly angry.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.960
Kind of he goes shoots a red- a rose thorn.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.560
Thorn fires as fast as bullets,

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.480
but only bounces off the bloodstained sheet.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.480
Yes, yes, yes, we got this.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.760
Their blood- their blood denies him,

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.800
so that's what it meant.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.680
The impact of the thorn causes the sheet to start to fall off the umbrella.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.840
We don't put it back on.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.200
We won't be able to protect ourselves.

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.800
Okay, we're close, we're close, we're close.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.040
Kind of he goes sways closer,

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.520
as if the umbrella is irritating him.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.160
Um, do I do it again?

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.560
Ten pies, do you think I do it again?

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.720
How close does he- does Hanahiko need to be,

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.520
so I can be like,

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.840
Behold!

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:40.640
Salt water!

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.080
Why do I just do salt water now?

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.600
He might be able to do something if he comes a little closer.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.040
Okay, he has to come a little closer.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:10:00.720
How to weaken spirits.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.520
Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.120
Okay, one more time.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.000
To defeat a spirit,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.240
you must use a specific item to weaken them.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.560
It can't be used until the spirit is as close as possible.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.000
Okay, we have to protect again,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.200
and then yes, yes,

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.560
we'll have to protect again,

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.080
and then we'll use the salt water,

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:23.680
I think,

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.480
and yeah.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.120
And then the red thing, right?

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.640
Give me the red thing,

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.480
so the red thing I think is the lipstick.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.360
When that happens,

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.000
the green- the screen outline will glow red,

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.240
and deer the spirits attack until they are in range.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.240
Okay, it's not red yet,

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.000
so um, classic cheat.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.000
Wire umbrella.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.840
It's not red yet, is it?

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.280
Yeah.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.080
It's still green.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.320
Put the wire umbrella over the plastic sheet,

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.000
and he goes to choose a red thorn.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.600
Okay, okay, is this- is this red?

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:18.800
Is this red?

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.840
Ten pies, is this red?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.560
Not yet.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.160
Do we do it again, then?

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:48.080
One more time.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.600
Put the wire umbrella over the plastic sheet.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.200
And he goes to choose a red thorn.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.880
Is it close now?

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.760
Is it red now?

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.080
Yes, this is red!

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.960
And he goes- comes up close.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:21.200
Countless vines wriggle in his oddly shaped head.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.560
They're like poisonous snakes about to strike their prey.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.400
At this distance, the umbrella is pretty useless.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.520
It's obvious I'll be killed instantly if I don't do anything.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.240
This close distance is my only chance.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.440
Should I use an attack against spirit,

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.680
or an attack against plants?

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.320
Is there a way I can fight back?

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.640
Yeah, let's use-

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.000
The salt water,

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.120
and Moe,

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.760
the lipstick, right?

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.280
Right, right, ten pies?

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.800
We use the red- the red.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.680
Yes, use the red!

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.040
Right?

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.480
Right, right, right!

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:05.600
Red!

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.560
Salt water!

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.680
Darling throws the salt water at Hanahiko!

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.600
Vines hit the salt water, quickly stops moving.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.640
In the hazy darkness, I can see Hanahiko's face

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.160
twisting in pain.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:29.840
Oh, mean.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.640
Are you going to tease me now too, mister?

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.760
He starts sniffling as if he's about to cry.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.000
It looks weakened.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.880
Hanah defeats spirits!

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.760
A- defeat a weakened spirit by using specific items.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.840
Choose an item based on the info you gathered.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.920
You only have one chance, then carefully.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.960
It's the red lipstick!

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.120
I got the lipstick.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.160
Put the lipstick on Hanahiko's lips.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.560
What did you do?

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.720
Hanahiko is weakened.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.240
Lipstick again?

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.440
Do we use the lipstick again?

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.000
What do we do?

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.440
Ten pies!

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:31.680
Mirror, mirror, and then lipstick!

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.360
Lipstick!

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:47.680
Yeah!

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.400
Show, use lipstick!

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.400
Be gone!

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.400
Smear the lipstick on him and try to place the mirror in front.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.880
Put the lipstick on Hanahiko and place the mirror in front of him.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.120
He stares at his reflection.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.880
This is red stuff.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.040
I've been looking for this for so long.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.280
The keepsake from my mom.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.040
Are these memories from when he was alone?

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:17.840
I don't know.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.560
I don't know.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.120
I don't know.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:19.840
I don't know.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.560
I don't know.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.120
I don't know.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:21.840
I don't know.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.200
Memories from when he was alive?

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.520
He smiles with his red lips.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:29.760
Am I pretty?

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:34.640
We did it.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.720
The spirit mounts into the darkness with a smile on his face.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.720
I don't sense Hanahiko anymore.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.440
Did we win?

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.040
Seriously?

01:15:59.280 --> 01:15:59.600
Yeah.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.560
Kind of hard to believe, but looks like we did.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:06.720
Mister!

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.640
My mark disappeared!

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.440
Well, I cheers as she studies her leg.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Her mark has been burned into a right thigh.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.720
Oh, what about yours?

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.720
Oh yeah, my right hand.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.640
It's still there.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.440
My mark looks exactly the same as before.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:28.880
Why?

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.000
Why isn't it going away?

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.520
Sorry, mister.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.680
It's almost gone.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.320
Am I going to die?

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.360
So this is where you've been.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.840
My head suddenly stopped feeling fuzzy.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:46.800
Then my mark was gone.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.320
Looks like you did it.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:50.480
Yeah.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.840
But he still has his mark.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:57.760
Let's head back.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.600
Maybe Mary knows something.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:01.840
Yeah, you're right.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:03.760
Come on, mister.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.240
Let's go.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:06.800
Oh, it leads the way.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:11.940
Huh?

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.520
Oh, he's digging around her bag.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.360
Oh no, my wallet's missing.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.480
I dropped it earlier.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.680
Her glance back at the school is confused.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.280
But you're definitely more important right now.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.480
We've got to hurry and get back.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:32.720
Go on.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:33.940
Huh?

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.480
Let's make sure you're back in five minutes.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.080
Go get moving.

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:39.920
Great, great, thanks!

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.880
The boy rushes back into the school.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.160
You're pretty calm considering.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:51.520
The boy shrinks in the distance until they disappear inside the building.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.000
The bitingly cold wind just whips past me.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.200
It's coming from the school.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.440
That's not normal, especially for the start of summer.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.960
Wind dies down and out of nowhere I get a really bad feeling.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.160
Wait, no!

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.280
I have like Moeco back inside.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.760
Five minutes pass.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.120
Wait, did I fuck up?

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.520
Moe isn't back yet.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.160
Idiot, this is no time to doaddle.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.520
Better check.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.800
I step inside and go down the right hall.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.520
Make it all the way to the front room where we fought Hanahiko, but...

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.680
I don't see Moe anywhere.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.560
Strange, this should be the place.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.120
It missed her?

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.840
Scared the crap out of me.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:10.320
Fucking hell bitch, what the fuck, that was five minutes longer!

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.640
What are you doing here?

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.840
You're late so I came looking for you.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.200
She's alive!

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.640
We saved our... our... our Kohai?

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.920
It's dark so it took longer.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.160
I should have borrowed the flashlight.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.480
She bows in apology.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.480
I'm so relieved a huge weight lifts off my shoulders when I see she's okay.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.920
Hey, let's get a move on already.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.600
Kohai saved a Kohai, yeah!

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.080
We all climb into the car and head straight to Kujo Mansion.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:55.120
I almost thought I fucked up somehow.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:02.960
I'll come back.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.400
My mark's gone, so that must mean we beat Hanahiko, right?

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.720
This Moe seems to be okay too.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.640
I'm pretty amazing.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:12.720
Huh?

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.080
What's wrong?

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.040
You're not smiling.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.960
Well, his mark hasn't disappeared.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.080
What?

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.200
Why not?

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.440
Hey, darling?

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.480
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.040
I'll fill the pip squeak in.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.920
You go hear what Mary has to say.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:38.800
Welcome back, Lord Darling.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.960
It appears you overcame your fear and cleared away the grudge.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.120
Congratulations are in order.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.920
Your tone is the same as always, but for some reason it grates me.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.240
What's so great about it?

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.840
Why hasn't my mark vanished?

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.880
It is likely the one who gave it was not Hanahiko.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.760
I'm suddenly light-headed, the world fading.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.240
I'd risked my life during that investigation, and it was completely useless to me.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.880
I guess all that's left is waiting for Dawn and my death.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:35.760
Alright, darling?

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.640
Senpai, darling, is going to be constantly rizzed up by everyone in this game.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.000
Sure is.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.120
At least we saved everyone.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:49.680
Yeah.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.360
I thought I had a moment where I was like,

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:51.680
DUNNNNNNNNNNNN!

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.960
FUCK UP, I SMEEE!

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.600
If it is alright with you, would you mind showing me your mark?

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.640
I hold my arm out towards Mary.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.440
Her neck shifts slightly as she stares at the mark.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.440
It is as I thought.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:21.440
It is only a minuscule fraction, but the fate I sensed from this mark has been distorted.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:25.440
What does that mean?

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.440
Is it because I beat Hanahiko?

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:38.440
The flame of your life was indeed fading at one point, but now it has become brighter.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.440
Are you saying?

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.440
What if the mark was on the butt cheek, just though?

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.440
Then I guess you have to check out your butt cheek.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.440
She's going to have to look at your butt cheek.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:54.440
Isn't that right, Senpai?

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.440
I'm not going to die at dawn.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:05.440
That is correct.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.440
My sigh of relief is so deep, it feels like my soul is escaping my body.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.440
If only Kohai allows it.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:24.440
Well, I mean, I don't want my Senpai to die, not by my hand.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:28.440
So I guess you'll have to check it for me.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:45.440
But at the same time, any funny business and you will die before dawn anyways.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:50.440
The mark's still burned on me, but it seems I'll be okay for now.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:57.440
Life or death?

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:05.440
Your choice, quick time events, Senpai.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.440
It appears the mark- wait, sorry.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:14.440
It appears the mark you bear is different from the other ones I know of.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:19.440
But there is no doubt that it was given to you by a spirit.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.440
Then there are other spirits like Hanahiko that gives people marks?

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:32.440
Yes.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.440
Spirit-born.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:40.440
Spirit-born of grudges have an insatiable hatred for the living.

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:46.440
This persistent hatred is not seen by simply killing the living.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.440
Rather, they drag their victims to the depths of despair before their death.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.440
That is what they desire.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.440
The mark is an effective method.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.440
Spirits who wish to terrorize the living.

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.440
The more- the more I hear them, the less I understand.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:11.440
It appears something within each city can easily create such spirits.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.440
Though I could not say what it is.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:21.440
So for me to escape my mark, I need to find the spirit that gave it to me and take care of it then?

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:27.440
Yes, it is logical to believe the mark would disappear, the spirit.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:34.440
That is the only way to escape death and regain your memories.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.440
Great!

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.440
It will soon be done. I'm sure that you are all tired. Please rest.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:47.440
You are free to use any room.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:53.440
Thank you so much! Seriously! If you hadn't been there, I probably would have been killed by Hanahiko.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:03.440
But when I think about you still having your mark, it's hard to be happy.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.440
Well, I'm going to bed. Good night!

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.440
You did great work today. You're much more competent than all other adults I know.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.440
Though it only makes sense for adults to help children.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:24.440
It will be challenging from now on. My schoolwork has suffered due to my memory loss.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:27.440
I need to study hard to catch up. You do your best too.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:33.440
Well then, good night.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:41.440
Think of, I'm heading off myself. With that mess of trouble taken care of, I'm sure I'll crash right away.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.440
Alright, here have this.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:51.440
He pulls a small paper item from his beat-up coat and hands it to me. Looks like a newspaper article.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.440
It's about that boy who died before he was adopted. He lived with his mom.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.440
She understood her son, unlike his hard and adoptive father.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:06.440
Father should put makeup on him in front of a mirror. Very much doted on him.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:13.440
After all that hell at a young age and dying, that was probably his only good memory.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:24.440
Now she does smile, sad. Well, it's up to you how you interpret it. Do whatever you want. See ya!

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:31.440
Alright, darling, there's something I must tell only you.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.440
About those who lost their marks, they must leave in the morning.

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:42.440
Those who escaped their fate should return to their daily lives. That is the will of Lady Zaya.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:49.440
So I'll be the only one left behind? I feel like a student repeating a grade.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:58.440
Alright, darling, by any chance, are you uneasy about being the solo occupants in this mansion?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:03.440
Uh, Senpai, what should we say?

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:10.440
Kind of, eh? Not at all. You're here. You're here? Okay, I'll say, well, you're here.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:15.440
Riz time.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:22.440
Not at all? Yeah, we're gonna Riz.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:32.440
I must express my extreme gratitude that you hold me in such regard. Although the things I am capable of, they are rather limited.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:40.440
Mary stairs unblinkingly in. I could just be extrapolating, but it seems like she's thinking about something.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:52.440
Now then, Lord Darling, it would be for the best that you take your rest as well. Please find me when you are ready.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.440
Farewell.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.440
Oh, she's a doll? Yeah, she's a doll.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:05.440
New info was added to the spirit file. Mashi just collection of articles, other.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:13.440
Uh, I forgot how to save here. Wait, next save. Ha ha!

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:32.440
Yeah, let's rest.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.440
Good night.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:45.440
So we can Riz the doll and, uh, not die? It doesn't count, right?

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:58.440
Another night greets me. It's been three days since the investigation and not one glimmer of hope for me.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:03.440
Time idles by as death draws even closer to claim me.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:16.440
The mark that brings death. The only way to escape it is to defeat the spirit that gave it to me.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:28.440
But I have no clue where that spirit is right now. Maybe things would be different if that specialist Sayakujo was alive.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:33.440
The knock breaks my train of thought.

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:39.440
Oh hey! Oh hey! Look, Senpai, it's our not boyfriend!

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.440
Our not boyfriend for our very manly sa-

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.440
How long do you plan on sleeping?

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:57.440
You're pretty relaxed for a guy who could die soon. Can you raise him up maybe?

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:15.440
The ex-detective Satoru, Satoru, Satoru Mashita, the other markbearer left the mansion, but he stayed behind. Mary was the cause. I guess she asked him to help as he was leaving.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:22.440
She went against Sayakujo's wishes by doing that, but it seems it was for my sake.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:35.440
But I don't know about Mashita. Even if he was asked to stay, he has no reason to agree.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:41.440
What's that look? Not happy I stayed behind? No! Very happy!

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:46.440
I'm grateful! We're going to Rizz!

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.440
We're gonna Rizz, we're gonna Rizz, okay? I'm grateful.

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:56.440
Cut that out, it's creepy. Damn it! Damn it!

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.440
Why am I always shot down?

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:17.440
We have no Rizz mercy, this is what happens. Why do we have none? We can't win the maw.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:22.440
Man, I was hoping that it would be like, darling.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:29.440
Flatter me all you want, but I won't forget you drove without a license.

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.440
Wait, that's what you're mad about! Also, I do have a license, Senpai.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:39.440
Do you have a license, Senpai? I wouldn't shoot you down, mercy. Oh, nice.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:46.440
Nice! He's over mad over that!

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.440
Of course I do, okay, okay.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:55.440
The criminal debuff, we have to be a good citizen now.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.440
He's got a bad mouth, as usual. I've got my learner's permit.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:07.440
What's keeping Senpai from getting the whole license?

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.440
No, sorry, Kohai, it's okay.

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.440
Learn together.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.440
And your driving instructor called you Vomit Girl.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.440
I still got my license.

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:34.440
I still got my license, even though to this day that driving instructor probably remembers me after vomiting in the car.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:44.440
His true intention aside, I have to say I'm honestly grateful for his help.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.440
Now the question is, do you have a car to use said license? Yeah.

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:56.440
Well, it's the family car, but I have a car.

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.440
My car is...

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:07.440
is a Toyota.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.440
It's a RAV4.

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:21.440
My amnesia could hit without warning, so I can't go wherever I want.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440
A car is a car. A car is a car.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.440
How many bad Senpais have you ran over with it?

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:36.440
I prefer to just chase all my own.

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.440
And how many crashes have you had?

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.440
Two. Not at fault, though.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.440
Not at fault accidents. Both of them.

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.440
Yeah, doing it with the car isn't as intimate. You're right.

01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:02.440
Both times was not at fault.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.440
Is your insurance up to date? Oh, Kohai, yeah!

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.440
Were they bad crashes?

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.440
One of them was, and the other one...

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:25.440
My car was written off, the first car was written off,

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:28.440
but it was not my fault. I was parked,

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:32.440
I was stopped at a pedestrian crossing with pedestrians crossing,

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.440
and a car ran into my butt, the car butt,

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:38.440
and then I got like a concussion and stuff,

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:40.440
but it's not bad. I'm still here.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.440
Were they texting and driving? I don't fucking know.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:58.440
And the other one was like, just like a tiny, tiny thing.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.440
So yeah, I was like, what the heck?

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:05.440
What the heck?

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:15.440
So yeah, it was just a long process, and I'm okay.

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:19.440
And I've also updated my insurance recently.

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:23.440
Right before, right before I joined VLR,

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.440
I updated my insurance and I was super stressed about it.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.440
Because like, the cost of insurance went up, and I cried.

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.440
I cried a little.

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.440
Not because like, it was a while ago,

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.440
so it's not because of an accident or anything,

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.440
and my premiums went up, it's just all,

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.440
everything went up in price.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.440
Did you remember the registration as well?

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.440
I'm registered, yeah.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.440
I'm registered, don't worry, everything's good.

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.440
Gotta love price hikes, yeah.

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.440
Car insurance is cringe, but I have to have car insurance,

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:16.440
otherwise it's, otherwise it's not great.

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440
Call hi, that doesn't sound convincing.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:25.440
Well, I'm pretty sure everything's up to date, and I'm pretty sure.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:29.440
I'm pretty sure.

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.440
Mama and Papa take care of the license plates registration,

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.440
and then I just have to take care of my drivers,

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.440
my driver stuff, yeah.

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:41.440
Anyways, this economy sucks.

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.440
Insurance is expensive.

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.440
How often do you drive?

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.440
Oh, like almost every day, depending.

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.440
Maybe more like every other day.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.440
More like every other day because, you know,

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:05.440
sometimes I want to go out with my friends, right?

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.440
Don't forget the tire change for summer and the auto change.

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.440
Surprise, shut up!

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.440
Are you a good driver?

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.440
I would say I'm a good driver.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.440
I would say I'm a good driver.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.440
At least a defensive driver.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.440
Anyways, surprise, shut up!

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.440
I think everything's, I know, I know, I know.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.440
Everything, everything, everything is fine, I think.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.440
I think everything's fine.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.440
Is your state inspection up to date?

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.440
I'm sure everything's fine.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.440
What about break, shut, shut up!

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.440
I'm sure everything's fine.

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.440
I'm sure everything's fine.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.440
I'm sure everything's fine.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.440
Listen, as your senpais, we worry about our coil.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:18.440
The jacks in the car, the spare tire is still there.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.440
What about your air filter?

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.440
Stop!

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.440
Everything's up to date!

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.440
Everyone, yes!

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:35.440
The lights are fine!

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.440
I checked them!

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.440
I checked the batteries!

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.440
The oil is fine!

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.440
Gas is fine!

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.440
Brake pads are fine!

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.440
I feel like, I feel like...

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.440
I feel like, you know...

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.440
I feel like...

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:55.440
I feel like, you know...

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.440
I feel like...

01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.440
I feel like...

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:01.440
I feel like, you know...

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.440
I feel like...

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.440
Senpais are like...

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.440
are like my parents now.

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.440
Did you lock it?

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.440
It's in the garage!

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.440
Did you lock your garage?

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.440
Did they lock?

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.440
It's done!

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.440
We're playing the game, Senpais!

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.440
Stop, stop, stop!

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.440
Wait, are you playing to escape using my car?

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.440
I don't know...

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.440
I don't know...

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.440
I don't know...

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.440
I don't know...

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:09.440
I don't know...

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.440
I don't know...

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.440
I don't know...

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.440
I don't know...

01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.440
I don't know...

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.440
I don't know...

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.440
I don't know...

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.440
I don't know...

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.440
I don't know...

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.440
Senpai...

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.440
Senpai...

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:51.440
We're gonna have to teach you another lesson again!

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.440
We're gonna have to teach you another lesson again!

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.440
If you really love the Senpais, you give us the key!

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.440
Yeah, I'll give you a key!

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.440
I gave you the key to my heart,

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.440
and now you're gonna betray me, you bastards!

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.440
It's time!

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.440
It's time you learn another lesson, okay?

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:19.440
We're gonna do...

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.440
some broken legs!

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:25.440
...

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.440
WAAAH!!!

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.440
...

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.440
I saw some people from the force!

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.440
...

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.440
...

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.440
...

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:43.440
...

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.440
still no ruckus over H Elementary.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.440
...

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.440
...

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:51.440
Ugh!

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.060
that guard went missing his company should be notified that company is

01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:00.720
exactly the issue it's run by yakuza thugs who have their eyes on the labor

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:05.000
department I know what the place involved plus in a shitty company like

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.980
that people up and walk out all the time yeah machita that was his name

01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:13.760
everyone thinks he up and split here that's why they're having a hard time

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:19.600
finding replacement if you didn't know the school was haunted it would just be

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.760
another abandoned building the government wouldn't need to rush to find a

01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.480
new guard the man lived alone so I'm missing person report won't be filed

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:32.280
soon the school most likely won't come under suspicion until then that's it for

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.600
my report he covered a lot of ground in a short time ex-detectives sure are

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:45.040
handy did you bring up the markers periods or when you were asking around do

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:50.720
you think I'm an idiot I'd be calling the looney bin even if the kids or I

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:57.480
bring them up who'd honestly believe us why waste my breath

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:03.800
exasperated he shrugs searching the mansion searching the mansion was on

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:10.680
was on you so did you find anything I came up blank as well though I only

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:18.840
gone through half so far and some of the rooms were lost stuck without a warrant

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:24.360
like you'd wait for something like that I swallowed the words before they came

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:35.000
out oh yeah Mary's asking for you you should get going to be fair nine out of

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.680
ten abandoned buildings are haunted are they I've been waiting for you Mary is

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:46.280
sitting primly on the couch the same as always

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:55.240
source yes have that has some pies have you seen a ghost

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:03.320
it appears you're having a difficult time with your investigation I do wish I

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:09.680
be of more use to you I know you can sense mark bearers can you send spirits

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:20.040
to if they were to come onto the grounds I believe I could yes ghost don't pay rent

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:33.000
or taxes I feel like if you ever move into into the into like a place that's

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:41.520
haunted I feel like I would demand the ghost to pay rent I think I would demand

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:55.000
the ghost to pay rent why did you bring up another I think I would force it to

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:05.080
pay rent probably it's only fair I think I'd like to be roommates with a ghost I

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:12.080
don't know they seem invasive you know invasive like you never really have true

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:17.680
privacy with a ghost around do ghosts have money I'm sure there's way for them

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:31.480
to make money that doesn't sound particularly useful do you have any

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:37.320
other abilities or powers like for example you know maybe they can be like a

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:43.280
detective like a detective and then though they can go into houses and figure

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:55.480
out if people are having affairs or they can you do guard stuff right maybe

01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:02.160
they can get money they can watch people at your passwords or pins you have any

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:09.160
cage ghost cage for the senpais who die the senpais who die won't even have

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:11.160
spirits

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.160
why do you have spirits

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:32.160
why not they'll probably be exercised by by mama mama mercy

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:52.160
indeed I can view the big shape of the car course of a person's life predicting the future

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:57.160
a lot of me and mama mercy are cool like that

01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.160
um

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:10.160
no no I don't think she would like it either so should probably exercise you anyways

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:21.160
oh no nothing quite so extreme it is more akin to fortune telling it may or may not come to pass

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:30.160
I get it that's why what you predicted earlier didn't actually happen

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:36.160
did Mary tell you something

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:45.160
can we just stay in the cage regardless you can stay in the cage of course

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:49.160
well that's your home senpai

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:56.160
the truth you're seeking can be found here or something such like a fool I felt

01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:59.160
so convinced such an idiot

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.160
new characters

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:31.160
hey this place cool Joe mansion

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:42.160
I got business with some side chick

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:48.160
no way you huh

01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.160

01:50:54.160 --> 01:51:00.160
anyway you guys knows her yeah would you hear me out

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:19.160
introductions are quickly done his name is soul Nagashima as we guess he's got a mark

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:27.160
he rolls up his right sleeve to show us and yep the red mark is burned in

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:33.160
and a cult freak friend says some

01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:39.160
like it gives you a knee job for real

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:53.160
yeah that's true I can't even remember my real name you're kind of too calm for

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:55.160
all that

01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:00.160
but you're pulling a fast one on me

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:06.160
what am I doing

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.160
that greats but the reaction is normal

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:18.160
but if he's not gonna believe the rumors then he's got no he has no reason to come

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:26.160
why is he here then

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:34.160
how rumors of just that I need you're on dying cuz of some mock that's comic book

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:38.160
craziness craziness

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:47.160
every word of it is true every word of it is true well what's that a ghost voice

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:56.160
there's a saying the truth is stranger than fiction

01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:03.160
there are two sides of the same calling Mary begins explaining I'm sure she

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:07.160
figured out it would be fastest way to convince him

01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:18.160
you got some damn speaker set up somewhere don't you don't you know I don't

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:25.160
take kind of wait wait I don't take kindly the threats I don't take kindly the

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:36.160
threats he peers closely at Mary that's a mechanism does not exist large

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:45.160
no way no way

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:53.160
he yells pathetically his eyes wide and suddenly falls flat on his ass

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:03.160
you seem to that despite appearances this punk is terrified of ghosts and

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:15.160
monsters he is tough act is likely a cover after that he meekly pays full

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:20.160
attention to Mary as she speaks he listens quietly his face pale as she

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:26.160
tells him about the mark and spirits by the time she finishes explaining his

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:33.160
face is devoid of color now large show have you not already experienced the

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:42.160
beginning of memory loss yeah I don't think he's used to marry it his face is

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:48.160
rather stiff my memory has always been crap so I thought I was imagining

01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:57.160
things but now it's started so bad it was just ridiculous I got this occult

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:05.160
friend yeah told him about my scar the mock and he scared the shit out of me

01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:11.160
showed me an article that said it was all the scars things fall

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:21.160
so now I'm here

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:32.160
Molly mentioned seeing an article by Sayaku Joe in a magazine to it's all

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:42.160
because of some monster the hell this is crazy why this has to happen to me

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:49.160
not believing is normal if you don't you die if you don't want to kick the bucket

01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:54.160
figure out how you got the mark even if your memory's gone bad you should at least

01:55:54.160 --> 01:56:02.160
remember that I'm not that far gone thanks

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:36.160
I think I think I definitely I'm going a little bit too silly hey I'm positive I

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:43.160
got in the fullest but each cast so I know I did I mean it does have a womb

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:51.160
about it the place being cursed so we should probably ask him more about it

01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:59.160
forest the huge forest west of the city wait doesn't everybody everyone know

01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:09.160
that even kids do but I've lost my memory maybe that's why I don't know about it

01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:15.160
places the city's garbage dump bunch of nasty rumors about it there's a legal

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:23.160
industry industrial waste dumping there like all the time it's not just objects

01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:29.160
either say a black car once dumped a young woman's body there a new mother

01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:36.160
strangled her kid there because she could take it care of it did they say it

01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:43.160
instead of of it okay yeah there's ton more rumors like that whether or not any

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:50.160
of them are true I heard some of those too like the gloss kid who'd eaten by dog

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:55.160
and they only found his torso or that murderous hides out there and kills

01:57:55.160 --> 01:58:09.160
anyone gets near apparently while he hates ghost he's got more than fine with this

01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:19.160
kind of stuff I've hit up the edge of the forest a few times but never walked in

01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:25.160
no one would have a plane

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:32.160
what should I ask next it's cursed

01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:41.160
a plane sorry I said plane

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:48.160
Joe stiffens like a board I hate that supernatural crap

01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:59.160
I'm starting to let go we'll talk with this

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:08.160
just talking about it freaks me out

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:17.160
what a wimp

01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:25.160
New York

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:31.160
rumor exists for a reason that place is a famous suicide spot 50 people die

01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:37.160
there a year so they say and that's just what they find once there was a mass

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:43.160
suicide has a fair share of grizzly history

01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:51.160
shows eyes are wide he looks like he swallowed a bug what should I ask

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:58.160
next why were you there I was obviously on my bike man places totally empty at

01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:04.160
night so it's perfect for driving around riding around free as a bird helps me

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:08.160
clear my mind

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:15.160
before you ask yes I have my license and no illegal mods

02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:21.160
huh is that so

02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:25.160
we don't need another person flaunting the law when it's enough

02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:37.160
I smile Riley Riley who would have thought this kid would be on the straight and narrow

02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:43.160
that day I was clearing my head when my bike broke down

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:50.160
I'm so sad

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:55.160
I stopped to check it out then suddenly I got the scar

02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:59.160
I definitely get any more out of show

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:06.160
no info on the spirit then you haven't forgotten anything no keeping secrets now

02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:12.160
quit strong on me hold your horses I'm thinking

02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:19.160
he's complaining but I can see he's really coming through his memories

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:25.160
there was some I wasn't a ghost or nothing but I did spot some weird

02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:30.160
over by the side of the road I saw this huge man

02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:37.160
a giant huge

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:42.160
sounds like you're plugging your nose oh shut up

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:48.160
what is this accent anymore I don't know and I'm still gonna wing it some pie and you're gonna like it

02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:51.160
a wound

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:54.160
it wasn't just some trees shadow

02:01:54.160 --> 02:02:03.160
honestly I'm not sure the place was pretty dark and I only saw it for a second

02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:08.160
it sounds pretty heavy

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:13.160
is that the is that info really reliable

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:20.160
may I interject in truth there are a number of supernatural rumors out there

02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:27.160
when it happens to cooperate Lord Shell's story

02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:31.160
the rumors if she meal

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:39.160
it sounds like Mary has an idea

02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:42.160
could you tell us more about it

02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:47.160

02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:56.160
I just tell you the story of she meal the man of the forest

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.160

I don't like that I don't like that

02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:43.160
I've heard he asks everyone he meets a question

02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:49.160
do you like these

02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:52.160
college student heard the rumor decided to go to the forces

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.160
oh no oh no

02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:00.160
oh no it's

02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:06.160
it's gonna be ninja scroll all over again

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:09.160
it's gonna be ninja scroll all over the again

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:11.160
I really hated that guy

02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:16.160
my try phobia is gonna go crazy

02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:21.160
my try phobia is gonna go crazy

02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:30.160
I love bees I just I like I like holes

02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:34.160
and a man covered in splotches really did appear

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:39.160
no I'm not allergic to bees but I love I love bees I just don't like holes

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:43.160
you know like the holes the student left you like bees

02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.160
yeah sure I like him and then

02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:52.160
let's raise something

02:04:52.160 --> 02:05:01.160
in your body

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:03.160
aw man

02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:08.160
aw man

02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:12.160
he meal as those he meets a single question

02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:16.160
and kills them using his drill

02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:21.160
that might that might be none other than the figure you saw on the show

02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:24.160
however I have no proof

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:30.160
there are holes

02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:41.160
there are holes in this house

02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:43.160
then we'll have to gather evidence

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:45.160
let's get ourselves to the forest

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:50.160
investigation requires legwork

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:52.160
there's no hesitation in mashita

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:59.160
after facing hanahiko he knows full well what spirits are capable of

02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:03.160
is this his training and experience as a police detective

02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:08.160
ain't now you silly yes silly yes

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:16.160
going there in the middle of the night you guys are totally lost

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:21.160
you scared

02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:24.160
what do you say I ain't no scaredy cat

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:27.160
hey old man take me with you instead of him

02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:29.160
if that huge guy really is some monster

02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:35.160
I bound him to dust

02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:42.160
he's easy to manipulate

02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:44.160
you've set out on a destination

02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:46.160
you've head to the forest by each castle

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:48.160
once you're ready

02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:52.160
your first goal is to identify the spirit that bestowed the mark

02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:58.160
best wishes for your investigation

02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:00.160
new info was added to the spirit file

02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:03.160
the forest and shimio

02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:05.160
new chapter item changes

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:09.160
all items obtained within a chapter are removed at the end

02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:14.160
if a character brings an item it will start the edit at the start

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:16.160
new chapter soul power

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:19.160
oh we'll return to 1000

02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:23.160
shit okay what do we have

02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:27.160
shimio

02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:29.160
okay

02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:31.160
first round by a stranger fans suicides and body dumping

02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:33.160
and the likes are scared off their casual visitor

02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:36.160
only the occasional test of courage brings a foolish kid inside

02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:38.160
the paths are shaded at all hours with the trees

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:41.160
so it's easy to become lost amongst the rumors swirling

02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:43.160
about this forest is one of a bizarre man

02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:45.160
a spotted man shimio

02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:47.160
is covered in dark splotches asks

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:49.160
he meets if they like bees

02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:53.160
if they say yes he attacks while laughing maniacally

02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:55.160
he sounds like you're standard crazy

02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:57.160
but I guess he's the next spirit will face

02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.160
at any rate we'll have to head to the forest to investigate

02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:01.160
the forest... okay

02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:03.160
we're good

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:08.160
who are we gonna take

02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:11.160
the insulin punk or the ex detective

02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:14.160
senpai who should we take

02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:16.160
punk

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.160
punk 100% okay

02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:25.160
punk leaves the way

02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:38.160
okay I guess we'll take him

02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:43.160
let's go

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:46.160
let's go

02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:52.160
oh shit you're right I didn't save

02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:00.160
shit why am I

02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:02.160
dammit why

02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:08.160
she'll throw himself into the passenger seat

02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:10.160
and mumbles an endless

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:12.160
litany of complaints

02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:14.160
I really want to tell him to shut up

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:16.160
but I'm pretty sure that'll only make things work

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:22.160
it's only natural for a guy his age

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.160
hey old man you got smokes

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:28.160
I blank in surprise

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:30.160
it's a cigarette uh

02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.160
I instinctively put my hand in my pocket

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:34.160
but then I come to my senses

02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:38.160
you're not old enough for that yet

02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:40.160
shut up I'm 19 already it's fine

02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:44.160
whoa you have your answer

02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:52.160
19 but you're still in high school

02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:54.160
now I've done it

02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:56.160
I've overcome with regret the instant I say it

02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:58.160
but I can't take it back now

02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:00.160
well it skills me for repeating the grade

02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:06.160
oh shit

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:08.160
oh shit

02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:14.160
looks like I touched a sore subject

02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:16.160
even though it wasn't my intention

02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:20.160
oh no

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:22.160
senpai how can you be so callous

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:32.160
how can you be so callous

02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:34.160
senpai

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:40.160
the atmosphere in the car was bad enough

02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:42.160
and now I made it worse

02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:46.160
it's okay

02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.160
it's okay to repeat grades

02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:52.160
I need to change the subject

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:54.160
so are you in a club or anything

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:02.160
how's this on us because

02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:04.160
this the main character is senpai darling

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.160
remember

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:08.160
you look pretty fit so maybe baseball

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.160
or

02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.160
yeah I played

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:14.160
but I quit

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.160
my emergency just saved

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:18.160
just swarmed into dangerous territory

02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:20.160
oops

02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:28.160
bulk bulk

02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:30.160
rock my knee

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:32.160
too many laps

02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:34.160
coach kept saying I had bad attitudes

02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:36.160
look that I'm funny

02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:38.160
sorry

02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.160
why you apologize

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:42.160
I don't care about that shit

02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:46.160
I couldn't really get into

02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:48.160
it under that shitty coach anyway

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:52.160
I think I know now why he rides

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:54.160
his motorcycle alone in the mountains

02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:00.160
but if he came to Kujo mansion after

02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:02.160
I set back like that

02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:04.160
ah fuck

02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:06.160
it's seriously frustrating

02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:10.160
keeps a string of swearing for a while

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:14.160
anyone would act the same

02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:16.160
anyone would swear up a storm

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:18.160
but keep going down the same path anyway

02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.160
down this dark uncertain road

02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:22.160
that only leads to death

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:36.160
we arrive at the forest by H castle

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:38.160
I stopped the car near where Shou said

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:40.160
he saw the man and we entered the forest

02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:44.160
all the guideposts on the path surfaded

02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:46.160
their paints peeling off

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:48.160
it looks hardly travest

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:50.160
just as Shou and Mashita said

02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:54.160
call

02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:56.160
roll

02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:58.160
sue

02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.160
is that call

02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:02.160
did I read it right?

02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:06.160
I can't remember anymore

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:12.160
why don't we walk

02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:14.160
a while

02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:16.160
we come by a large arc marking the start of hiking trail

02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:24.160
it's rested over and with the paint

02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:26.160
peeling it doesn't seem to have been

02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:28.160
it doesn't seem to have been touched up

02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:32.160
the letters have faded

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.160
nor mostly

02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:36.160
illegible

02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:38.160
carefully reading it it says

02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.160
welcome to the M

02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:50.160
blush and romantic you are

02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:56.160
wood timberland murder

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:02.160
murder

02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:04.160
murder huh

02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.160
coincidence that's all

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:08.160
it's just because it's way

02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.160
old and faded

02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:12.160
come on old man let's go already

02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:16.160
we pass through the arc

02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:18.160
and enter the forest

02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:24.160
well let's look around first

02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:28.160
I don't think I've been

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:30.160
it's been used in a long time there's no garbage littered

02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:32.160
either

02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:34.160
I feel around inside the container

02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:36.160
but nothing's inside

02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:38.160
dang it

02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:42.160
the weather beaten

02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:44.160
table and benches are clearly damaged

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:46.160
and rotting in places

02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:48.160
feel I peek underneath the table

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:50.160
and find something stuck there

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:52.160
I found a worn out talisman

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:54.160
when I pick up the worn out talisman

02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:56.160
I feel warm throw

02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:58.160
me yes

02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:00.160
I got soul power

02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:08.160
the sworn out talisman crumbles silently

02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:10.160
in my hand

02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:14.160
I feel like I should go back

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:16.160
and like save

02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.160
I'm gonna go back and save

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:22.160
I'm gonna go back and save

02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:24.160
yeah

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:26.160
let's save first

02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:32.160
actually let's do

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:34.160
no yes no yes

02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:36.160
let's save here it's a new chapter

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:40.160
ouch

02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:42.160
get myself

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:44.160
this game has time limits

02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:46.160
or no

02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.160
no

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:50.160
no

02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:52.160
well they have quick time events

02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:56.160
right

02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:04.160
okay we're back there again

02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:10.160
it reads welcome to the lush and romantic

02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:12.160
wood timberland

02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:18.160
let's move forward

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.160
can you down the path a short while

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:24.160
before we come across something unexpected

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.160
the grave marker was probably put there

02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:28.160
to honor those who commit suicide here

02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:30.160
might not be a bad idea to say a quick prayer

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.160
for those who ended their suffering melee

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.160
look something's written in magic marker

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:44.160
say the opposite of the truth

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:46.160
you'll be followed

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:50.160
so scowled to cover how his face

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:52.160
is definitely pale

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:56.160
you'll be followed the hells with that

02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:58.160
dammit whose scribbles dumbass graffiti

02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:02.160
um

02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:06.160
I guess

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:12.160
when it says

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:14.160
I mean we have to lie

02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:18.160
just off to the side

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:20.160
I noticed a faint trail

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:22.160
discovered entrance to the beast

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:24.160
to the beast trail

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:28.160
look there's a path over there too

02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:30.160
ailment try to keep up

02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:34.160
what the fuck did we go

02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:36.160
you

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:40.160
lying officially allowed

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.160
first see who would

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.160
you say is the

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:46.160
the most facile

02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:48.160
probably me

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:52.160
probably me

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:56.160
because sometimes

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:58.160
I don't understand a lot of innuendos

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:06.160
between azura and mercy

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:08.160
I think

02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:10.160
it's probably still me

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:14.160
it's probably still me

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:16.160
it's because

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:18.160
it's probably still me because I don't get

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:20.160
a lot of innuendos

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.160
I don't know shibby's been saying you have a lot of hidden powers

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:26.160
what the heck has shibby been saying to you

02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:30.160
I mean I guess

02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:32.160
I guess

02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:36.160
in a way

02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:48.160
I have potential

02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:54.160
better yet

02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:56.160
I have potential

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.160
is that a better way to say it

02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.160
I

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:04.160
I

02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:06.160
I

02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:08.160
I

02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:10.160
I

02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:12.160
I

02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:14.160
I

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:16.160
I

02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:18.160
I

02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:20.160
I

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.160
I

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:24.160
I

02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.160
I

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:28.160
I

02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:51.560
probably and second most second most unhinged or like most most not say so

02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:58.600
would be it's a toss-up between I see and she be

02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:09.520
like I remember you saying what's a countdown do I say the number it's kind

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:14.580
of embarrassing sometimes I'm like I don't know what this means and then I go

02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:23.100
someone and they like I can feel the literal the literal like face palm as

02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:39.260
they're typing to me you know and then I go okay yeah it's some okay okay I okay

02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:43.700
it's something like that then it's something like that then

02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:59.540
it's okay it's okay I'll learn

02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:13.020
it's Johnny literally said she's the most say so I don't think Johnny is the

02:21:13.020 --> 02:21:20.860
most say so I don't think strong is the most say so let's just say that I don't

02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:25.740
think strong is the most say so because sometimes while we're together she says

02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:29.660
the most unhinged just things and I just go

02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:52.020
she just says things and I go okay the moonlight doesn't reach the beast trail

02:21:52.500 --> 02:22:00.180
the branches off the hiking trail so we're in gloom gloom the trees are thick

02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:10.620
on both sides and I think her favorite thing she likes to tell me is like I'm

02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:23.620
so glad we don't have an HR just department the trees are thick on

02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:32.940
both sides we'd get lost if I didn't have a flashlight just then fuck off

02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:44.340
there are footsteps close by from the bushes hold on did you hear footsteps

02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:55.260
too I think strongy is like from like most say so to like I'm say so to these

02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:59.700
say so strongy is above me because sometimes she can be pretty innocent

02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:11.740
too I hear footsteps again it better be a fucking dear it better be a motherfucking

02:23:11.740 --> 02:23:25.700
dear it seems to be getting closer then what okay it's a person

02:23:25.700 --> 02:23:44.340
corporate slaves spotted salary man spotted a man appears from the bushes he

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:54.220
looks horribly exhausted don't start on me like that you should stand around in

02:23:54.220 --> 02:24:03.100
the dark what are you doing here what are you doing man fall silent I think he

02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:09.700
realized he already knows the answer we can talk about this we can talk about

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:19.580
this nothing scarier than the nine to five I know we can talk about this sir

02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:24.820
Meshita did say this place is a famous spot for suicide no no no no no wait no

02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:33.980
no no no no it will get better I just can't do it anymore work myself to the

02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:44.580
bone at a job I don't even want okay fair fair but and you just bring another

02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:52.100
man home how dare you the nerve he holds his head in his hands he suddenly

02:24:52.100 --> 02:25:03.740
starts kicking a tree and yelling okay understandable understandable um listen

02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:09.140
she's not worth it she's not worth it man she's not worth it you know there's

tons of fish in the sea heck you can even be another oji-san

02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:29.660
fuck fuck a rapid stream of swear words flow out of his mouth

02:25:29.660 --> 02:25:40.700
you seems to be the type that goes crazy when he's upset

02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:49.380
hey could you tell me how much nerve do you have to do that huh

02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:56.140
listen I know I know you're going through a hard time I know you're going

02:25:56.140 --> 02:25:58.980
through a hard time man but like you know this isn't the answer this is in the

02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:01.380
answer

02:26:01.380 --> 02:26:08.780
stop him death and vice-death

02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:14.860
how do we how do we calm down

02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:24.380
Sampai's I've been in therapy! Sampai! Sampai we have to how how do we calm this man down

02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:29.620
wait do I have to tell him the opposite of the truth

02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:35.380
wait

02:26:37.940 --> 02:26:40.940
is he just a dog

02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:53.940
opposite of the truth is this the hint is this the truth

02:26:56.420 --> 02:26:59.420
Emmy NO!

02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:05.300
I heard that voice again

02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:15.460
thank you for the super chat for two shut the fuck up hear that voice again I

02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:18.660
think that would just make him more angry

02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:24.740
stop it does that mean I should dissuade him

02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:32.380
if you got some if you got something say just spit it out you bastard

02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:42.740
I'm bad I'm bad I'm bad at this I'm bad at this okay I can't come for for shit

02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:46.700

ah live or die shit

02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:04.900
sympathize sympathize I think sympathize with him right

02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:12.740
it'd be bad if we went berserk here I try to act like I sympathize but no no no

02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:18.420
you say you understand okay maybe I've calmed him down

02:28:18.420 --> 02:28:23.420
what budget are you trying to pull huh

02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:28.420
they only mean it worse

02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:33.420
I think so power lost wrong

02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:41.420
what did you think I was doing

02:28:43.420 --> 02:29:02.300

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:06.420
not good at this the tism the tism

02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:16.820

flattery

02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:53.380

02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:53.860
terrible I feel like I don't know I feel like comforting people is like so

02:34:53.860 --> 02:35:07.700
difficult game said not to be tackless and people said to do no um

02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:17.180

02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:54.380
her a person our anniversary last year oh you're right this one I don't know

02:53:54.380 --> 02:53:59.660

02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:04.300
hey you wasn't me do you think clear this up for me did I do something wrong oh

02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:19.460
shit wait oh someone's here yeah that's the one right what the man's gaze starts

02:54:19.460 --> 02:54:28.700
around nervously and he mutters quietly could it be that creepy guy he checks

02:54:28.700 --> 02:54:35.940
around on full alert satisfied that no one's there he resumes speaking okay

02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:44.900
I'm sure he should just laugh if she heard I was dead being off her asshole

02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:55.620
lover but when I think about it you know it's strange okay we give him tough love

02:54:55.620 --> 02:54:58.860
okay we give him tough love

02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:10.740
why do I have to make her happy when it caused me such pain ridiculous done with

02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:15.180

02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:50.820

02:55:57.260 --> 02:56:02.300
Senpai's did it Senpai's did therapy I'll die sometime soon even if it's not

whoa we did it Senpai I don't know what you've been through but you should

02:56:29.740 --> 02:56:34.620
rethink it honestly though you look like you'll be fine the expression changes

02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:38.620
as he remembers something it's all strange man where I was wandering around

02:58:51.340 --> 02:58:56.660
that's so mean what the hell's wrong with you kid

02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:06.980
like at first I was I I like sympathize that you like did another grade but now

02:59:06.980 --> 02:59:11.740
you're like a bit of an asshole like a little bit a lot of an asshole I didn't

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:16.420
feel this did I feel it there's the gray marker but nothing's unusual about it

02:59:16.420 --> 02:59:23.380
other than the graffiti anything else around here

02:59:29.380 --> 02:59:36.220
okay Jesus Jesus

02:59:37.980 --> 02:59:52.700
there was a light there wasn't there I go to open the door and my hands get

02:59:52.700 --> 03:00:02.220
coated with a sticky liquid

03:00:02.220 --> 03:00:15.500
I smell sweet is it honey

03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:25.260
Why would there be honey on a doorknob?

03:00:25.260 --> 03:00:27.180
Mystified, I step inside the cottage.

03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:34.900
I sure hope as fuck there's nothing here.

03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:39.180
How about that, it's clean.

03:00:39.180 --> 03:00:40.780
How about that, it's clean.

03:00:43.460 --> 03:00:45.260
It's been a night here, easy.

03:00:52.700 --> 03:01:02.620
I don't like the look of that, that, that bag.

03:01:02.620 --> 03:01:06.860
Ignore shows rambling and take a good look around the cottage.

03:01:06.860 --> 03:01:11.260
Not sure why, but something feels off.

03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:14.260
It takes me two seconds to figure it out.

03:01:15.220 --> 03:01:16.180
It's too clean.

03:01:26.340 --> 03:01:29.300
Huh, show looks at me startled.

03:01:30.740 --> 03:01:31.780
Don't you think it's strange?

03:01:32.740 --> 03:01:36.500
Why would a building that's been abandoned for so long get this clean inside?

03:01:36.900 --> 03:01:38.900
Oh.

03:01:49.700 --> 03:01:53.220
I don't even have to look to know his face just turned three shades whiter.

03:01:54.820 --> 03:01:56.820
Saying someone lives here?

03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:02.740
I don't know for sure, but it's possible someone comes here occasionally.

03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:11.300
That or I immediately start shining my flashlight on places of interest.

03:02:20.900 --> 03:02:22.740
Maybe I should have brought the cough instead.

03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:29.060
What do you think's in this bag?

03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:30.340
Pretty big.

03:02:31.220 --> 03:02:32.820
How should I know?

03:02:32.820 --> 03:02:35.940
If you're so interested in it, why don't you open it already?

03:02:37.860 --> 03:02:41.540
She'll give me the go-ahead, so I open the burlap sack.

03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:48.500
Before I can stop it, it loses its balance and topples it to the floor.

03:02:49.300 --> 03:02:50.980
She'll's eyes open wide again.

03:02:50.980 --> 03:02:52.500
Just a gasp.

03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:56.500
Ugh.

03:02:56.660 --> 03:02:57.460
Senpai!

03:02:58.500 --> 03:02:59.300
Not again!

03:03:01.220 --> 03:03:02.660
Senpai not done!

03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:10.420
Hold on.

03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:10.980
Hold on.

03:03:10.980 --> 03:03:11.940
Senpai, don't look.

03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:13.780
Senpai, don't look.

03:03:15.140 --> 03:03:16.100
Senpai, don't look.

03:03:16.100 --> 03:03:16.740
Don't look.

03:03:16.740 --> 03:03:17.860
Don't look, Senpai.

03:03:18.580 --> 03:03:19.860
Senpai, don't look.

03:03:19.860 --> 03:03:22.420
I don't even know where to cover first.

03:03:22.420 --> 03:03:23.540
There, there.

03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:34.020
YouTube, YouTube, this is fine.

03:03:48.420 --> 03:03:56.180
While it rolls onto the floor, it's a corpse.

03:04:03.220 --> 03:04:03.780
A woman.

03:04:08.900 --> 03:04:10.260
What's with that body?

03:04:11.460 --> 03:04:14.020
The body is drilled with countless holes.

03:04:18.660 --> 03:04:25.620
A sharp cylindrical tool must have gouged them.

03:04:29.060 --> 03:04:31.780
Please, please, please don't tell on me, Senpai.

03:04:34.660 --> 03:04:38.100
Even otter, her whole body appears to be covered in liquid.

03:04:40.180 --> 03:04:43.620
Why did, why did you have to say it like that?

03:04:48.660 --> 03:04:55.860
A thick sweet scent fills the air, strong enough to make you want to cough.

03:04:58.980 --> 03:05:00.180
Is this honey?

03:05:06.100 --> 03:05:06.500
Honey?

03:05:08.900 --> 03:05:10.340
Stop looking, Senpai!

03:05:15.140 --> 03:05:16.180
On a corpse?

03:05:16.180 --> 03:05:16.580
Why?

03:05:18.820 --> 03:05:19.380
Why?

03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:24.660
He's not really asking me, obviously.

03:05:24.660 --> 03:05:25.940
There's no way I'd know.

03:05:25.940 --> 03:05:27.540
Should I've gotten a cough instead?

03:05:27.540 --> 03:05:30.980
He would handle this much better than a teenager,

03:05:30.980 --> 03:05:32.820
more technically still in his teens.

03:05:32.820 --> 03:05:33.540
One more year.

03:05:38.740 --> 03:05:40.420
I don't like holes either, so.

03:05:42.340 --> 03:05:42.660
Cool.

03:05:44.820 --> 03:05:47.780
All I do know is we need to get out of here.

03:05:47.860 --> 03:05:48.900
As soon as possible.

03:05:50.740 --> 03:05:52.420
Let's hurry and search the rest of the cottage.

03:05:54.660 --> 03:05:55.140
What?

03:05:55.140 --> 03:05:56.260
You're gonna look around?

03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:08.900
What, what are we gonna do about this?

03:06:09.940 --> 03:06:11.700
He's not expecting us to take it, is he?

03:06:12.980 --> 03:06:14.100
Close the bag, put it back.

03:06:14.660 --> 03:06:15.380
That's all we can do.

03:06:15.380 --> 03:06:16.500
Come on, help me out.

03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:21.940
Hey, this isn't the time to be freaking out.

03:06:21.940 --> 03:06:23.140
Actually, yes it is.

03:06:24.020 --> 03:06:25.060
Cool, it's freaked out.

03:06:33.460 --> 03:06:35.700
Sweating profusely, we managed to get the job done.

03:06:37.060 --> 03:06:39.140
Okay, that was, that was pretty disturbing.

03:06:39.140 --> 03:06:39.780
Not gonna lie.

03:06:39.780 --> 03:06:41.620
Yeah, actually, that was pretty, you know.

03:06:43.300 --> 03:06:43.780
That was...

03:06:45.060 --> 03:06:46.340
Holes are rough?

03:06:46.340 --> 03:06:48.340
I told you, Senpai, I hate holes!

03:06:56.580 --> 03:06:58.500
I still need to search the rest of the cottage.

03:06:59.620 --> 03:07:01.780
New info was added in the spirit file.

03:07:01.780 --> 03:07:02.820
Carps in the cottage.

03:07:04.980 --> 03:07:06.820
What, what was it, trypophobia or something?

03:07:06.820 --> 03:07:08.420
Yeah, I have trypophobia.

03:07:09.140 --> 03:07:09.860
I hate it.

03:07:09.860 --> 03:07:10.980
I hate it so much.

03:07:17.140 --> 03:07:20.660
Okay, what are these books?

03:07:22.180 --> 03:07:22.500
Look.

03:07:23.620 --> 03:07:25.300
Honeybees are our friends.

03:07:25.300 --> 03:07:29.300
Make them ammoable with medicine from the sprayer.

03:07:30.260 --> 03:07:30.980
They get mad.

03:07:30.980 --> 03:07:33.380
Pay attention to the direction the hive is facing.

03:07:34.020 --> 03:07:35.140
Awaken to honeybees.

03:07:35.140 --> 03:07:37.220
Leave the hive in the direction of the sun.

03:07:39.700 --> 03:07:40.100
Go.

03:07:41.140 --> 03:07:42.260
Honeybees are our friends.

03:07:43.060 --> 03:07:43.380
No.

03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:51.060
It looks like something useful.

03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:51.460
Information.

03:07:51.460 --> 03:07:52.740
Should I rip it out and take it with me?

03:07:56.020 --> 03:07:56.740
Burrow the page.

03:08:04.420 --> 03:08:07.220
Make hive, new body, smear honey all over.

03:08:07.220 --> 03:08:10.900
Ferment, honey gets stinky, stinky liquid!

03:08:16.340 --> 03:08:19.780
Thank you for the tip and on.

03:08:19.780 --> 03:08:20.580
Thank you, Mercy.

03:08:22.420 --> 03:08:24.340
Oh, and sorry, I missed the super chat.

03:08:24.340 --> 03:08:26.020
Thank you for the $2 super chat, boy.

03:08:26.900 --> 03:08:29.060
And welcome to being in my merryuki.

03:08:32.900 --> 03:08:33.780
Stinky, huh?

03:08:35.300 --> 03:08:38.500
Gone by smell, honey bee enter hive.

03:08:39.460 --> 03:08:40.740
Looks like some useful information.

03:08:40.740 --> 03:08:42.340
Should I rip it out and take it with me?

03:08:42.340 --> 03:08:42.580
Yeah.

03:08:44.580 --> 03:08:45.780
I'm going to need to remember that.

03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:50.980
A bottle of drugs is all in line.

03:08:50.980 --> 03:08:52.900
Look, the labels say night night.

03:08:53.460 --> 03:08:54.740
Also, the bottles are empty.

03:08:56.500 --> 03:08:59.300
I shake each one and luckily find one that still has some left inside.

03:09:00.180 --> 03:09:00.820
But night night.

03:09:03.700 --> 03:09:06.340
I remove the lid and look inside, but all I find is dust.

03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:07.220
Okay, useless.

03:09:10.900 --> 03:09:11.860
Meadow to a box.

03:09:13.140 --> 03:09:13.620
Locked.

03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:14.500
There's no way to open it.

03:09:17.300 --> 03:09:18.500
Can I feel it?

03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:23.460
There's thin layer of dust built on the outside.

03:09:23.460 --> 03:09:24.820
No one has touched it for a long time.

03:09:26.820 --> 03:09:27.540
I love this one.

03:09:28.980 --> 03:09:31.860
Peek through the cracks to see if anything's inside, but seems to be empty.

03:09:39.060 --> 03:09:39.780
Anything else?

03:09:40.180 --> 03:09:45.060
I flip the switch at the base of the light bulb, but it doesn't turn on.

03:09:45.060 --> 03:09:45.780
Maybe it's broken.

03:09:50.180 --> 03:09:52.020
Can we get this later, Senpai?

03:09:56.260 --> 03:09:57.700
Do you think we're done, Senpai?

03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:10.980
Save just in case?

03:10:10.980 --> 03:10:12.340
I don't think I can save here.

03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:18.900
Boxes in the corner of this one?

03:10:18.900 --> 03:10:20.900
Oh, they said there was nothing but dust inside.

03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:32.900
Open the door and let the cabin.

03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:41.060
Okay.

03:10:47.060 --> 03:10:48.340
We're going to save scum again.

03:10:53.460 --> 03:10:57.860
We're going to save scum again because I think we can only save at Kujo Mansion?

03:10:57.860 --> 03:10:59.060
I don't actually remember.

03:11:10.100 --> 03:11:18.980
Okay, well, we haven't taken this trail yet.

03:11:22.820 --> 03:11:24.020
Shut the fuck up!

03:11:26.740 --> 03:11:27.140
Sorry.

03:11:28.900 --> 03:11:33.140
As we continue through the dense forest, the pain cries suddenly echoes amongst the trees.

03:11:34.660 --> 03:11:35.380
Do I have to?

03:11:36.580 --> 03:11:37.220
Nice hand.

03:11:40.020 --> 03:11:41.300
There's a pattern on the tree trunk.

03:11:42.260 --> 03:11:43.860
It's an arm-like pattern on the bark.

03:11:43.860 --> 03:11:45.380
Is this even a natural occurrence?

03:11:47.140 --> 03:11:51.540
Look around the tree and find a talisman on the exact opposite side of the tree from the pattern.

03:11:52.340 --> 03:11:53.780
Yes! A worn-out talisman!

03:11:53.780 --> 03:11:54.260
We did it!

03:12:00.820 --> 03:12:04.020
When I pick up the worn-out talisman, I feel warmth flow through me.

03:12:04.020 --> 03:12:05.540
Give me back my stuff!

03:12:05.540 --> 03:12:06.500
Thank you!

03:12:06.580 --> 03:12:07.620
Got soul power.

03:12:07.620 --> 03:12:09.860
Or now a talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:15.620
Anything else?

03:12:17.940 --> 03:12:18.660
Move forward.

03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:27.460
I don't see anything.

03:12:28.980 --> 03:12:29.940
Keep moving forward.

03:12:32.420 --> 03:12:33.620
Wait, is this another one?

03:12:37.220 --> 03:12:40.740
Look, something's written in Sanskrit.

03:12:40.740 --> 03:12:41.700
But the letters are blurry.

03:12:41.700 --> 03:12:42.740
It just looks like a stain.

03:12:44.260 --> 03:12:45.860
Off to the side, I notice a thin trail.

03:12:47.460 --> 03:12:48.420
Down the beast trail.

03:12:49.620 --> 03:12:50.180
Thought so.

03:12:50.180 --> 03:12:51.300
There's one here too.

03:12:51.860 --> 03:12:52.660
Come on, let's go.

03:12:54.340 --> 03:12:55.700
Follow Sho into the bushes.

03:12:58.660 --> 03:12:59.300
Ugh!

03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:00.020
Not you again!

03:13:02.260 --> 03:13:03.540
Sho spots something.

03:13:03.620 --> 03:13:06.660
Something instumbles, calling backwards onto me.

03:13:06.660 --> 03:13:09.140
At the same time, every single hair on my body stands on end.

03:13:14.660 --> 03:13:15.060
Hi!

03:13:22.180 --> 03:13:25.460
I quickly look down and find a guy!

03:13:27.060 --> 03:13:28.900
Something is clinging onto my ankle.

03:13:28.900 --> 03:13:30.420
It's expression anguished.

03:13:31.380 --> 03:13:33.780
Is this where we tell the opposite?

03:13:33.780 --> 03:13:34.900
Is this where we lie?

03:13:36.340 --> 03:13:38.260
It seems eager to speak for me,

03:13:38.260 --> 03:13:40.900
but his voice is incredibly hard to decipher.

03:13:45.940 --> 03:13:50.820
This place pitch black.

03:13:53.860 --> 03:13:55.540
Something can't see anything.

03:14:01.140 --> 03:14:02.260
I can't see what he is.

03:14:02.260 --> 03:14:03.300
I don't know what the last one is.

03:14:03.300 --> 03:14:03.780
What do you think?

03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:07.300
What do you think that the third word is?

03:14:07.300 --> 03:14:09.140
The third thingy?

03:14:14.580 --> 03:14:15.700
What's it saying?

03:14:16.500 --> 03:14:16.900
Goon?

03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:20.340
Goon, goon.

03:14:20.340 --> 03:14:21.540
Okay, okay.

03:14:21.540 --> 03:14:22.100
Goon.

03:14:30.100 --> 03:14:31.380
Wait, that grade marker said,

03:14:31.380 --> 03:14:32.420
say the opposite of the truth.

03:14:32.420 --> 03:14:33.460
Okay, okay, okay, we're good.

03:14:35.220 --> 03:14:36.580
But what's the opposite of the truth?

03:14:36.580 --> 03:14:38.420
Does that mean I'm supposed to lie?

03:14:38.420 --> 03:14:38.820
Yeah.

03:14:41.140 --> 03:14:43.220
Live or die.

03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:46.260
Again, okay.

03:14:47.140 --> 03:14:47.940
Hey, wait.

03:14:48.820 --> 03:14:49.220
Are you?

03:14:51.620 --> 03:14:52.660
Lifeless too?

03:14:57.140 --> 03:14:57.780
What does that mean?

03:15:01.380 --> 03:15:03.140
No, no, no, I'm not, right?

03:15:04.180 --> 03:15:06.020
Oh, wait, yes, we are li-

03:15:06.020 --> 03:15:07.300
Yes, we are lifeless.

03:15:07.300 --> 03:15:09.140
Yes, we lie.

03:15:09.140 --> 03:15:09.460
Yes.

03:15:15.700 --> 03:15:16.180
I am.

03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:24.100
It looks sad and lonely.

03:15:27.060 --> 03:15:27.300
I-

03:15:29.620 --> 03:15:30.100
Right.

03:15:30.100 --> 03:15:30.820
Okay, right?

03:15:30.820 --> 03:15:32.260
Only the dead are here.

03:15:38.580 --> 03:15:39.060
Safe.

03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:41.380
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:15:42.020 --> 03:15:42.740
Quick.

03:15:42.740 --> 03:15:44.420
I hear another voice at my feet.

03:15:46.660 --> 03:15:46.820
M-

03:15:48.020 --> 03:15:49.780
M-M-M-I, dead.

03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:51.060
No, no, you're not dead.

03:15:51.940 --> 03:15:52.340
Right?

03:15:52.340 --> 03:15:55.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, you're not.

03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:55.940
No, no.

03:15:58.100 --> 03:15:58.420
Oh.

03:16:02.260 --> 03:16:02.500
Don't-

03:16:03.780 --> 03:16:05.300
I don't believe it.

03:16:05.300 --> 03:16:06.180
I don't understand.

03:16:08.740 --> 03:16:09.540
Am I?

03:16:09.540 --> 03:16:10.340
Okay, am I?

03:16:12.340 --> 03:16:12.820
What?

03:16:12.820 --> 03:16:13.700
You dead?

03:16:13.700 --> 03:16:14.740
No, no.

03:16:15.700 --> 03:16:16.260
Tell me.

03:16:16.820 --> 03:16:17.940
Are you dead?

03:16:17.940 --> 03:16:18.740
Am I dead?

03:16:18.740 --> 03:16:19.060
No.

03:16:19.860 --> 03:16:20.660
No.

03:16:20.660 --> 03:16:22.660
No, no.

03:16:26.180 --> 03:16:27.060
Deny it.

03:16:27.060 --> 03:16:27.620
Yeah.

03:16:27.620 --> 03:16:29.060
No, no, you?

03:16:29.060 --> 03:16:29.460
No.

03:16:29.460 --> 03:16:30.340
Look at you.

03:16:30.340 --> 03:16:32.900
Look at your pink skin and the soft-

03:16:34.020 --> 03:16:35.380
soft flushes of your-

03:16:36.500 --> 03:16:38.020
your- your cheeks.

03:16:38.020 --> 03:16:38.820
Yeah.

03:16:38.820 --> 03:16:39.460
Look at you.

03:16:39.460 --> 03:16:41.460
So much life in your eyes.

03:16:47.940 --> 03:16:48.500
No, wait.

03:16:48.500 --> 03:16:52.020
I still have to suffer- suffer.

03:16:54.020 --> 03:16:55.460
Along with your complexion.

03:16:59.140 --> 03:17:00.500
It looks sad and lonely.

03:17:02.100 --> 03:17:02.820
Okay, okay.

03:17:02.820 --> 03:17:03.860
Another lie.

03:17:03.860 --> 03:17:04.500
Another lie.

03:17:06.260 --> 03:17:08.020
I hear yet another voice at my feet.

03:17:11.700 --> 03:17:13.460
Someone, please listen.

03:17:13.460 --> 03:17:21.940
I want to live.

03:17:22.500 --> 03:17:23.540
I want to live.

03:17:23.540 --> 03:17:25.060
I want to live.

03:17:25.060 --> 03:17:25.780
Okay.

03:17:25.780 --> 03:17:27.060
Or is it I want to love?

03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:30.260
Like, 75s love me, right?

03:17:36.900 --> 03:17:38.500
I- I'm-

03:17:40.740 --> 03:17:41.620
I'm alive.

03:17:42.420 --> 03:17:42.820
Wait.

03:17:43.700 --> 03:17:45.620
Senpai's help.

03:17:45.620 --> 03:17:47.460
Do I say, yep, you are alive.

03:17:47.460 --> 03:17:48.340
Yep, you are.

03:17:51.700 --> 03:17:52.820
Do I say that?

03:17:52.820 --> 03:17:53.620
Do I say that?

03:17:53.620 --> 03:17:55.620
Or do I say the opposite of what they're saying?

03:17:56.340 --> 03:17:56.740
No, wait.

03:17:56.740 --> 03:17:57.540
I lie, right?

03:17:58.740 --> 03:17:59.700
Yep, you sir.

03:17:59.700 --> 03:18:00.500
You sure are.

03:18:02.580 --> 03:18:03.380
We need to lie.

03:18:03.380 --> 03:18:04.260
Yeah, we need to lie.

03:18:04.260 --> 03:18:06.500
So therefore, we got to go like, oh, yeah.

03:18:06.500 --> 03:18:08.180
Yeah, you are so alive.

03:18:14.420 --> 03:18:17.140
Uh, step on the ghost.

03:18:17.140 --> 03:18:17.700
Not.

03:18:17.700 --> 03:18:19.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're alive.

03:18:19.220 --> 03:18:19.700
You're alive.

03:18:21.620 --> 03:18:22.100
That's right.

03:18:22.100 --> 03:18:22.900
I'm alive.

03:18:22.900 --> 03:18:23.620
I'm alive.

03:18:24.340 --> 03:18:26.260
The voice sounds like it passes through me

03:18:26.260 --> 03:18:27.780
and sucked into the ground.

03:18:30.740 --> 03:18:31.300
Safe.

03:18:31.300 --> 03:18:31.620
Woo!

03:18:36.260 --> 03:18:37.380
The stuff ending.

03:18:38.100 --> 03:18:40.980
Next thing I know, the shadow clutching at my ankle is gone.

03:18:42.020 --> 03:18:42.820
Survive.

03:18:42.820 --> 03:18:44.180
Whoa, we did it, Senpai.

03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:51.620
Show stands there, his face deathly pale.

03:18:53.540 --> 03:18:54.340
No way.

03:18:54.340 --> 03:18:55.300
I saw it.

03:18:55.300 --> 03:18:56.900
God, it was so clear.

03:18:59.300 --> 03:19:00.020
It's OK.

03:19:00.020 --> 03:19:00.660
It's over now.

03:19:01.940 --> 03:19:02.260
Right.

03:19:04.500 --> 03:19:05.060
Oh, man.

03:19:06.260 --> 03:19:06.740
Oh, what?

03:19:07.860 --> 03:19:08.580
You're awesome.

03:19:13.620 --> 03:19:19.940
Are we bonding after you said that guy needed to die?

03:19:23.380 --> 03:19:24.980
Well, he's certainly straightforward.

03:19:27.860 --> 03:19:28.900
Sure, let's go.

03:19:31.380 --> 03:19:31.780
Yeah.

03:19:36.980 --> 03:19:38.820
Is there anything at the end of this footpath?

03:19:39.540 --> 03:19:40.180
What the hell is this?

03:19:43.780 --> 03:19:48.980
Look, carefully approach it, but I don't see any bees.

03:19:50.660 --> 03:19:52.980
Open the box and find a metal tool inside.

03:19:53.860 --> 03:19:54.580
Got crowbar.

03:19:56.420 --> 03:19:57.700
Oh, what's this doing here?

03:19:58.420 --> 03:19:59.140
Why not grab it?

03:20:02.820 --> 03:20:04.020
I don't think there's anything else.

03:20:05.620 --> 03:20:06.980
Guess we go through the thing.

03:20:06.980 --> 03:20:13.140
Step into the empty clearing.

03:20:15.140 --> 03:20:17.220
The air is filled with buzzing of bees.

03:20:19.380 --> 03:20:21.700
There appears to be a giant beehive there.

03:20:23.620 --> 03:20:26.820
This probably wouldn't be right to keep going without doing something about them first.

03:20:28.580 --> 03:20:30.260
These things are dangerous.

03:20:30.820 --> 03:20:31.460
Dangerous.

03:20:32.500 --> 03:20:33.060
Dangerous.

03:20:37.220 --> 03:20:41.460
Oh, man, don't push your luck.

03:20:42.260 --> 03:20:43.060
Don't push your luck.

03:20:44.740 --> 03:20:46.020
You beat a hasty retreat.

03:20:47.300 --> 03:20:47.700
Shit.

03:20:48.660 --> 03:20:54.740
OK, so what now?

03:20:59.780 --> 03:21:01.060
What's the bee note say again?

03:21:02.420 --> 03:21:05.220
They said, but we need like a spray thingy.

03:21:06.100 --> 03:21:06.580
Hold on.

03:21:06.580 --> 03:21:07.860
Let me look at my memos.

03:21:16.500 --> 03:21:17.940
Oh, Azura.

03:21:19.380 --> 03:21:20.820
Welcome in Raiders.

03:21:21.620 --> 03:21:23.460
Welcome, Azura.

03:21:23.460 --> 03:21:24.340
Welcome to the stream.

03:21:24.340 --> 03:21:25.060
Hello, Raiders.

03:21:25.060 --> 03:21:26.420
How was one shot?

03:21:26.420 --> 03:21:27.300
Did you finish?

03:21:29.060 --> 03:21:30.340
Azura.

03:21:30.340 --> 03:21:31.620
Azura.

03:21:31.620 --> 03:21:32.420
Azura.

03:21:32.980 --> 03:21:36.420
Azura, did you finish one shot?

03:21:38.260 --> 03:21:39.220
Welcome, Raiders.

03:21:39.220 --> 03:21:40.820
Welcome to the stream.

03:21:43.620 --> 03:21:44.420
You already know me.

03:21:44.420 --> 03:21:45.620
I'm Mercy Modiste.

03:21:50.820 --> 03:21:53.940
I've arrived and no, it was much longer than I thought.

03:21:53.940 --> 03:21:54.580
Oh, OK.

03:21:54.580 --> 03:21:55.700
Well, you have another stream.

03:21:55.700 --> 03:21:56.180
Don't worry.

03:21:56.820 --> 03:21:57.860
Welcome, everyone.

03:21:57.860 --> 03:22:00.740
Today we are playing a game called Deathmark.

03:22:00.740 --> 03:22:04.900
It's like a visual novel with some quick time events.

03:22:06.020 --> 03:22:06.260
Yeah.

03:22:09.140 --> 03:22:09.460
Yeah.

03:22:09.460 --> 03:22:17.460
So yeah, it's a visual novel, horror visual novel.

03:22:17.460 --> 03:22:17.700
Yeah.

03:22:20.260 --> 03:22:21.060
What's in my bag?

03:22:21.060 --> 03:22:21.460
Hold on.

03:22:24.420 --> 03:22:26.980
OK, honey bees are friends.

03:22:26.980 --> 03:22:29.300
Make them friendly with medicine from the sprayer.

03:22:29.300 --> 03:22:32.580
If they get mad, pay attention to the direction the hive is facing.

03:22:32.580 --> 03:22:33.700
Awaken honey bees.

03:22:33.700 --> 03:22:35.300
Leave the hive in the direction of the sun.

03:22:36.580 --> 03:22:38.020
Make hive new body smear.

03:22:38.020 --> 03:22:38.900
Honey all over her.

03:22:38.900 --> 03:22:40.580
My honey gets stinky like we draw my smile.

03:22:40.580 --> 03:22:42.340
Honey, enter hive.

03:22:42.340 --> 03:22:42.580
OK.

03:22:43.300 --> 03:22:44.740
Can be used with a sprayer.

03:22:44.740 --> 03:22:45.700
I don't have a sprayer.

03:22:46.980 --> 03:22:48.260
The goat is going to head to bed.

03:22:48.260 --> 03:22:49.860
I leave the bleeding hearts in your care.

03:22:49.860 --> 03:22:50.820
Behave, everyone.

03:22:50.820 --> 03:22:52.740
OK, thank you, Azura.

03:22:52.740 --> 03:22:56.500
And if anyone else is tired, yeah.

03:22:57.220 --> 03:23:03.300
Yeah, feel free to go to bed and just rest up.

03:23:03.300 --> 03:23:04.180
Thank you.

03:23:04.180 --> 03:23:05.940
Thank you, Azura, for bringing everyone in.

03:23:11.620 --> 03:23:12.980
Yeah, behave.

03:23:17.380 --> 03:23:18.500
Did I miss something?

03:23:23.780 --> 03:23:24.260
Hold on.

03:23:25.060 --> 03:23:27.220
Hold on every, every, every senpai.

03:23:34.420 --> 03:23:36.260
We can't go to the side yet.

03:23:36.260 --> 03:23:40.660
But I need a bee sprayer or anything.

03:23:42.340 --> 03:23:44.100
Maybe I missed something at the cottage.

03:23:50.500 --> 03:23:53.140
I think I missed something at the cottage senpai.

03:23:54.820 --> 03:23:55.380
Probably.

03:23:58.100 --> 03:23:59.060
Let's look around again.

03:24:05.380 --> 03:24:06.500
Open the box with a crowbar.

03:24:06.500 --> 03:24:07.220
Oh, right.

03:24:08.260 --> 03:24:09.860
Yes, you are right.

03:24:09.860 --> 03:24:10.580
You are right.

03:24:10.580 --> 03:24:12.340
We can probably open it with a crowbar.

03:24:15.140 --> 03:24:15.860
Anything else?

03:24:22.340 --> 03:24:22.980
Let's go in.

03:24:24.660 --> 03:24:25.140
Let's go in.

03:24:33.460 --> 03:24:34.020
Crowbar.

03:24:35.700 --> 03:24:38.340
Take out the crowbar and shove it under the lid of the toolbox.

03:24:38.340 --> 03:24:39.780
I put pressure on it.

03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:40.660
Use it as a lever.

03:24:42.020 --> 03:24:42.980
Throw a box prop.

03:24:42.980 --> 03:24:43.780
It's open.

03:24:43.780 --> 03:24:44.420
Got a sprayer.

03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:44.900
We got it.

03:24:45.460 --> 03:24:47.060
And I can use a variety of drugs.

03:24:50.980 --> 03:24:54.180
Manipulators will themselves be manipulated.

03:24:55.220 --> 03:24:56.020
What does this mean?

03:25:00.820 --> 03:25:01.620
What's that thing?

03:25:06.180 --> 03:25:08.980
The sun voice makes me jump but I shake it off and turns towards him.

03:25:10.100 --> 03:25:12.260
It's a tool that sprays chemicals and pesticides.

03:25:13.940 --> 03:25:17.220
You put the container of drugs in here and then do this.

03:25:18.420 --> 03:25:19.860
I quickly demonstrate how it works.

03:25:19.860 --> 03:25:23.460
Shoal scratches his head, his face, and his brow furls.

03:25:24.660 --> 03:25:26.420
You sure know a lot, oh man.

03:25:32.340 --> 03:25:34.260
I guess we don't manipulate a person?

03:25:34.260 --> 03:25:35.380
No more lying, okay.

03:25:40.500 --> 03:25:41.780
I'll let you handle it then.

03:25:46.580 --> 03:25:48.260
Now I'm suddenly in charge of it.

03:25:48.260 --> 03:25:53.620
Well, I want, when I want to spray a drug, I'll have to choose which drug to use.

03:25:55.220 --> 03:25:58.260
But is this thing really that hard to figure out?

03:25:58.260 --> 03:25:59.460
I've never seen it before either,

03:25:59.460 --> 03:26:01.220
but I still know how to use it right away.

03:26:02.340 --> 03:26:04.020
Uninfo was added to spirit pile.

03:26:04.020 --> 03:26:04.900
Obtain sprayer.

03:26:06.660 --> 03:26:09.700
Can I use, oh yeah, wait, this one has nothing in it.

03:26:09.700 --> 03:26:12.180
Okay, yeah, yeah, Senpai smart.

03:26:12.180 --> 03:26:13.940
Senpai smart, let's get the fuck out of there.

03:26:20.420 --> 03:26:22.420
I don't think we're old, but I guess

03:26:22.420 --> 03:26:30.580
according to Shoal, we're older than him, so I guess that's fine.

03:26:30.580 --> 03:26:31.460
Okay, we're gonna,

03:26:37.860 --> 03:26:39.060
we're gonna save scum.

03:26:39.060 --> 03:26:41.780
Wait, am I not, wait, where am I?

03:26:45.700 --> 03:26:46.900
Oh, okay, there we go.

03:26:46.900 --> 03:26:48.260
I know which way I'm facing now.

03:26:52.420 --> 03:27:22.100
Okay, so now we can use the night knight on, on the bee stuff.

03:27:22.900 --> 03:27:24.340
Step into the empty clearing.

03:27:26.340 --> 03:27:28.660
Okay, air is filled with the buzzing of bees.

03:27:28.660 --> 03:27:31.220
Okay, then appears to be a giant beehive here.

03:27:31.860 --> 03:27:34.340
Probably wouldn't be wise to keep going without doing something about it first.

03:27:35.220 --> 03:27:36.100
Oh yeah, there's that.

03:27:37.940 --> 03:27:39.700
Take out the sprayer and hold in one hand.

03:27:40.660 --> 03:27:42.340
Should be able to use this to spray drugs.

03:27:43.380 --> 03:27:44.660
Okay, bag?

03:27:46.420 --> 03:27:47.300
Or can I just go?

03:27:47.380 --> 03:27:52.820
Shoal, night knight?

03:27:53.460 --> 03:27:55.300
Take out the night knight and put in the sprayer.

03:28:03.060 --> 03:28:05.300
I take careful aim and spray the drug.

03:28:08.180 --> 03:28:10.020
Oh, I should have been wearing,

03:28:10.020 --> 03:28:11.780
I should have been wearing goggles for that.

03:28:14.900 --> 03:28:16.500
The bees movements get slower.

03:28:17.300 --> 03:28:21.780
Eventually the hive falls completely silent.

03:28:23.700 --> 03:28:25.460
Mercy, how do you like the game so far?

03:28:25.460 --> 03:28:26.020
It's great.

03:28:31.860 --> 03:28:35.140
I think the only time, senpai, where I was, I like,

03:28:36.020 --> 03:28:39.060
I rage quit like a series.

03:28:39.060 --> 03:28:46.340
I think was index, where the one character I found out was 15 years old.

03:28:48.260 --> 03:28:50.740
I should show, show senpai's the character, hold on.

03:28:52.340 --> 03:28:54.900
I know this is, we're, we're taking a small intermission.

03:28:54.900 --> 03:28:56.340
I forgot what his name is.

03:29:08.180 --> 03:29:08.980
Senpai!

03:29:08.980 --> 03:29:09.620
Senpai!

03:29:11.220 --> 03:29:13.300
Thank you for this five dollar super chat.

03:29:17.860 --> 03:29:19.060
I rewatched the stream.

03:29:19.060 --> 03:29:21.220
My apologies for drunken ramblings.

03:29:21.220 --> 03:29:23.220
We'll lock up phone next time before I get,

03:29:23.220 --> 03:29:25.060
I guess very blessed, very unprofessional life.

03:29:25.060 --> 03:29:25.940
That's okay.

03:29:25.940 --> 03:29:26.900
It was funny.

03:29:27.620 --> 03:29:28.420
Hold on.

03:29:28.420 --> 03:29:29.700
I'm going to save this image.

03:29:30.980 --> 03:29:31.540
Not a web.

03:29:45.140 --> 03:29:46.420
I'm going to screenshot this.

03:29:46.420 --> 03:29:47.540
Hold on senpai.

03:29:47.540 --> 03:29:48.180
I got this.

03:29:57.140 --> 03:29:57.860
I got this.

03:29:58.900 --> 03:30:00.020
I got this senpai.

03:30:06.660 --> 03:30:07.700
Okay, okay.

03:30:07.700 --> 03:30:11.300
And then we'll add it to, to as an image file.

03:30:13.700 --> 03:30:15.140
Careful, don't talk to yourself.

03:30:15.140 --> 03:30:17.220
I'll, I'll be, I'll be extra careful.

03:30:28.100 --> 03:30:31.220
And then it should be the last one.

03:30:32.500 --> 03:30:33.540
This character!

03:30:35.700 --> 03:30:37.220
This freaking character!

03:30:38.020 --> 03:30:39.940
Senpai is 15 years old!

03:30:46.100 --> 03:30:48.340
I like rage quits so hard.

03:30:57.060 --> 03:30:58.900
I'm like, no fucking way!

03:31:03.380 --> 03:31:04.260
He's 15.

03:31:04.260 --> 03:31:05.380
I was like, damn!

03:31:06.420 --> 03:31:07.460
Are you serious?

03:31:15.540 --> 03:31:20.500
Wiki says 14, I was even more worse!

03:31:20.500 --> 03:31:21.540
It's worse than I thought!

03:31:21.540 --> 03:31:22.660
It's 14!

03:31:22.660 --> 03:31:23.460
Nevermind!

03:31:25.060 --> 03:31:26.420
Nevermind, he's 14.

03:31:26.420 --> 03:31:27.540
That's even worse.

03:31:27.540 --> 03:31:29.620
I thought, I remembered it completely wrong.

03:31:32.980 --> 03:31:34.180
No, he's 14.

03:31:34.180 --> 03:31:35.860
That's totally wrong.

03:31:40.420 --> 03:31:42.980
Is there some magic or some synapse?

03:31:43.300 --> 03:31:45.940
Is there some magic or some synanigan involved?

03:31:46.900 --> 03:31:47.620
No.

03:31:47.620 --> 03:31:48.740
I don't think so.

03:31:48.740 --> 03:31:48.980
No.

03:31:51.540 --> 03:31:53.380
This kid's fucking 14.

03:31:55.700 --> 03:31:57.140
It has to be a mistranslation, right?

03:32:00.420 --> 03:32:02.580
Oh, 14 now makes sense.

03:32:02.580 --> 03:32:03.220
Come on.

03:32:05.380 --> 03:32:07.220
Anyways, yeah, that's the character.

03:32:07.220 --> 03:32:08.180
That's the character.

03:32:08.740 --> 03:32:10.980
I, um, I like kind of rage quit.

03:32:10.980 --> 03:32:12.500
I might pick it up again, but oh!

03:32:13.060 --> 03:32:14.420
It just took me out of it.

03:32:14.420 --> 03:32:15.620
I was like, no way.

03:32:24.100 --> 03:32:26.580
I like, I was so into it and then that happened.

03:32:26.580 --> 03:32:26.980
I was like.

03:32:31.940 --> 03:32:33.140
Oh, I can't do it.

03:32:37.620 --> 03:32:39.540
It's worse that it's not 15.

03:32:39.540 --> 03:32:40.500
It's 14.

03:32:40.500 --> 03:32:41.060
Oh man.

03:32:43.460 --> 03:32:44.100
It's fine.

03:32:44.100 --> 03:32:44.580
It's fine.

03:32:44.580 --> 03:32:45.140
So fine.

03:32:49.780 --> 03:32:52.500
But yeah, because we were talking about ages.

03:32:54.260 --> 03:32:56.980
Doesn't the teacher look like an actual child also?

03:32:56.980 --> 03:33:01.780
I don't remember, but I do remember just being shell shocked by,

03:33:01.780 --> 03:33:05.700
by this kid and then just going, I can't do this man.

03:33:05.860 --> 03:33:13.860
Okay, let's continue.

03:33:13.860 --> 03:33:14.420
Okay.

03:33:14.420 --> 03:33:15.940
So eventually the hive come.

03:33:15.940 --> 03:33:17.060
Well, it's completely silent.

03:33:17.780 --> 03:33:19.460
Used up one bottle of night night.

03:33:23.700 --> 03:33:25.780
I've silenced every hive in this area.

03:33:25.780 --> 03:33:26.740
Now we can pass through.

03:33:28.020 --> 03:33:28.340
Yes.

03:33:28.340 --> 03:33:28.740
All right.

03:33:32.020 --> 03:33:32.900
Way to go.

03:33:32.900 --> 03:33:33.540
Oh man.

03:33:33.540 --> 03:33:34.260
You got this.

03:33:36.260 --> 03:33:39.220
Anything else?

03:33:41.380 --> 03:33:42.100
No spooks.

03:33:50.020 --> 03:33:51.140
What the fuck was that?

03:33:51.700 --> 03:33:52.020
Whoa.

03:33:53.220 --> 03:33:55.140
Did you just hear some kind of animal?

03:33:59.220 --> 03:34:01.300
I heard it and sounds familiar.

03:34:01.300 --> 03:34:03.940
Sorry, my stomach does kind of sound like someone's stomach.

03:34:03.940 --> 03:34:05.940
Huh?

03:34:05.940 --> 03:34:08.340
I say you wouldn't happen to have any night night yourself.

03:34:09.140 --> 03:34:10.500
I have a lot of chlorophyll.

03:34:11.460 --> 03:34:13.060
Farm, chlorophyll, yeah.

03:34:18.020 --> 03:34:19.540
Oh wait, it's probably the bunny.

03:34:22.900 --> 03:34:23.460
Turning around.

03:34:23.460 --> 03:34:26.420
I wonder if it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:27.540
It's the bunny.

03:34:27.540 --> 03:34:28.180
It's bunny.

03:34:29.380 --> 03:34:29.940
Yep.

03:34:29.940 --> 03:34:31.380
That rabbit hops in front of me.

03:34:34.020 --> 03:34:34.820
Evo she be.

03:34:37.780 --> 03:34:38.980
She be with her tan?

03:34:38.980 --> 03:34:40.260
Toggle stop.

03:34:47.700 --> 03:34:48.260
A bunny?

03:34:49.700 --> 03:34:52.420
The rabbit's scare stares at us completely still.

03:34:52.980 --> 03:34:54.740
It's almost like it's waiting for us to follow.

03:34:56.740 --> 03:34:57.300
Hey, wait.

03:34:58.980 --> 03:35:00.740
The next thing I know, I'm rushing after it.

03:35:02.180 --> 03:35:03.780
Hey, hey, where do you think you're going?

03:35:03.780 --> 03:35:06.180
Oh man, rabbit.

03:35:13.060 --> 03:35:14.260
What's that H elementary?

03:35:14.260 --> 03:35:16.900
It showed us up and guided us when we were in trouble.

03:35:18.500 --> 03:35:19.700
Maybe the rabbit is good.

03:35:20.340 --> 03:35:22.260
We shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

03:35:25.620 --> 03:35:27.460
That's not some normal rabbit.

03:35:27.460 --> 03:35:29.060
It's definitely acting with intent.

03:35:29.860 --> 03:35:33.780
At last, the rabbit guides me too.

03:35:36.820 --> 03:35:37.860
The fuck is this?

03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:41.460
An old Shinto Tori gate.

03:35:45.460 --> 03:35:47.380
It looks evil as shit, Kohai.

03:35:49.140 --> 03:35:52.980
Well, what do you think I look like then?

03:35:52.980 --> 03:35:55.140
Do I look evil to you, Senpai?

03:35:59.060 --> 03:36:04.020
I'm super nice though, right?

03:36:09.220 --> 03:36:10.820
Yeah, you look more phone friendly.

03:36:10.820 --> 03:36:11.620
Seriously?

03:36:13.780 --> 03:36:14.340
Of course not.

03:36:14.340 --> 03:36:15.220
There's a heart on your face.

03:36:15.220 --> 03:36:15.700
Broken.

03:36:18.900 --> 03:36:20.100
Yeah, you look like a lot.

03:36:21.540 --> 03:36:22.660
Evil but cute.

03:36:22.660 --> 03:36:24.260
Why not the rabbit then?

03:36:24.260 --> 03:36:25.220
Why not the rabbit?

03:36:25.220 --> 03:36:26.420
It looks evil but cute.

03:36:30.020 --> 03:36:35.540
What, purple and friendly isn't evil?

03:36:35.540 --> 03:36:36.180
That's good, no?

03:36:36.180 --> 03:36:37.620
What about a rabbit then?

03:36:37.620 --> 03:36:39.460
A rabbit's cute, right?

03:36:45.540 --> 03:36:47.220
There's a shrine here?

03:36:50.740 --> 03:36:52.020
The rabbit's cute but evil.

03:36:52.020 --> 03:36:52.820
There's a difference.

03:36:52.820 --> 03:36:55.940
Okay, evil mercy be like I was supposed to be purple.

03:36:56.900 --> 03:36:59.380
Purple's royalty and mercy is our queen.

03:37:01.380 --> 03:37:02.100
Senpai.

03:37:04.980 --> 03:37:05.860
Thank you Senpai.

03:37:08.900 --> 03:37:11.620
I call it shadow sheebie, then we should follow it.

03:37:11.620 --> 03:37:12.660
We should follow it.

03:37:16.020 --> 03:37:18.180
Anything with red eyes should be instant red flag,

03:37:18.180 --> 03:37:18.820
except for you.

03:37:18.820 --> 03:37:19.620
I have red eyes.

03:37:19.620 --> 03:37:21.540
Yeah, actually, yeah, I do have red eyes.

03:37:22.500 --> 03:37:24.500
I don't know, it's kind of, yeah, it's red, right?

03:37:26.260 --> 03:37:30.180
Purple's also the color corruption.

03:37:30.180 --> 03:37:30.660
What?

03:37:33.300 --> 03:37:34.660
Senpai, what are you implying?

03:37:49.140 --> 03:37:50.900
Thank you, Nekohai, for joining.

03:37:51.860 --> 03:37:55.620
Joining, I'm out of here.

03:37:56.420 --> 03:37:57.220
Joining them buzz.

03:38:00.420 --> 03:38:01.620
The rabbit looks back at me,

03:38:03.860 --> 03:38:06.900
then soundlessly turns, it turns from the gate

03:38:06.900 --> 03:38:08.580
and hops into a bush nearby.

03:38:11.380 --> 03:38:15.860
Hey, old man, don't mess with me like that.

03:38:15.860 --> 03:38:17.700
You're nuts running off like that.

03:38:23.380 --> 03:38:25.300
The hell's with that bunny anyway?

03:38:26.740 --> 03:38:33.060
Something's bothering me about it.

03:38:33.060 --> 03:38:35.780
Sorry, I think that's totally a wrong voice.

03:38:37.700 --> 03:38:39.060
I lost sight of it here, though.

03:38:40.260 --> 03:38:41.780
Just then, from out of the darkness.

03:38:45.620 --> 03:38:47.460
Not the bees!

03:38:47.460 --> 03:38:48.900
Not the bees!

03:38:51.300 --> 03:38:52.340
Why, I order.

03:38:55.940 --> 03:38:57.700
Torrigate kind of messed up, yeah.

03:39:00.820 --> 03:39:01.860
Bees!

03:39:01.860 --> 03:39:04.260
A huge swarm of bees is sending us on us.

03:39:04.980 --> 03:39:06.100
Shit, watch out!

03:39:06.100 --> 03:39:08.100
There are bees everywhere!

03:39:08.660 --> 03:39:10.180
And damn, we gotta get out of here.

03:39:12.580 --> 03:39:16.260
Sho pulls my arm and we stumble back to the earlier crossroad.

03:39:17.220 --> 03:39:20.500
The info was added to the spirit file, mysterious shrine.

03:39:23.700 --> 03:39:24.020
Shit.

03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:31.700
Oh no, there's some rope there.

03:39:31.700 --> 03:39:32.100
No!

03:39:36.660 --> 03:39:38.420
Hey, Senpai, which way do we turn?

03:39:40.340 --> 03:39:41.620
Left or right?

03:39:46.180 --> 03:39:46.900
Turn around?

03:39:53.140 --> 03:39:53.700
Right?

03:39:53.700 --> 03:39:54.020
Okay.

03:39:56.340 --> 03:40:02.820
The buzzing of bees killed the area.

03:40:02.820 --> 03:40:04.740
Looks like there's another giant beehive there.

03:40:05.300 --> 03:40:08.020
Probably wouldn't be wise to keep going without doing something about them first.

03:40:09.780 --> 03:40:11.540
Take up the sprayer and hold it in one hand.

03:40:12.180 --> 03:40:13.700
Be able to use spray drugs.

03:40:16.580 --> 03:40:20.580
I don't think, Senpais, I don't have enough.

03:40:21.140 --> 03:40:25.860
I don't, I don't think I have any more, more, more night night.

03:40:27.460 --> 03:40:28.980
Punch the beehive, Mercy.

03:40:29.940 --> 03:40:31.540
That sounds like a terrible idea.

03:40:31.540 --> 03:40:32.180
Okay, what about...

03:40:37.460 --> 03:40:39.460
Oh, okay, we come back to the Torrigate again.

03:40:40.820 --> 03:40:43.860
Can't you maybe add in a little spray, some drugs on the bees or something?

03:40:44.660 --> 03:40:46.260
Even the sprayer could calm them down, but...

03:40:48.660 --> 03:40:50.100
There's a hive above the gate too.

03:40:50.580 --> 03:40:51.860
There's no way I can spray up there.

03:40:52.980 --> 03:40:54.260
Damn, I can't do that, huh?

03:40:54.260 --> 03:40:56.500
But something might be at the shrine.

03:40:58.500 --> 03:41:01.380
True enough, but that time the rabbit brought me here,

03:41:01.380 --> 03:41:02.900
it didn't try to go inside the gate.

03:41:03.940 --> 03:41:06.820
Maybe there's no reason to force our way in.

03:41:08.500 --> 03:41:09.300
Yeah, okay, bye!

03:41:17.220 --> 03:41:18.580
Okay, we're driven away.

03:41:18.660 --> 03:41:20.820
Um, left this time?

03:41:24.420 --> 03:41:25.780
Another one, okay, no.

03:41:31.380 --> 03:41:32.740
I don't have enough night night.

03:41:41.060 --> 03:41:43.300
But these aren't that violent, these ones are.

03:41:45.540 --> 03:41:46.340
I move forward.

03:41:49.540 --> 03:41:51.140
Where the hell am I?

03:41:51.860 --> 03:41:52.900
When did these get here?

03:41:54.980 --> 03:41:59.220
Look, noticeably dirty as if someone hasn't been here looking after it,

03:41:59.220 --> 03:42:00.500
and moss is growing on its back.

03:42:02.020 --> 03:42:04.580
Had around the Giso statue to search it.

03:42:04.580 --> 03:42:07.140
There's a strange texture on its moss covered backs.

03:42:07.140 --> 03:42:10.820
When I brush away the moss, I find a yellowed paper stuck to the statue.

03:42:12.260 --> 03:42:15.540
Found a worn out talisman.

03:42:15.540 --> 03:42:17.060
When I pick up the worn out talisman,

03:42:17.060 --> 03:42:18.500
I feel warmth flow through me.

03:42:20.980 --> 03:42:21.860
Got soul power.

03:42:22.580 --> 03:42:32.980
Worn out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

03:42:38.580 --> 03:42:41.380
There's some sly sliding wooden doors.

03:42:41.380 --> 03:42:44.340
Look, small crack between the doors.

03:42:44.340 --> 03:42:46.820
I can only imagine it creates a bad draft.

03:42:48.500 --> 03:42:48.900
Feel.

03:42:49.860 --> 03:42:51.780
Lighting door won't open, they seem to be locked.

03:42:53.220 --> 03:42:54.500
Can I use the crowbar on it?

03:42:56.180 --> 03:42:58.180
I got the crowbar and jamming into the door.

03:42:59.380 --> 03:43:00.980
Yeah, yeah, do it!

03:43:00.980 --> 03:43:01.860
It's the fastest way.

03:43:02.820 --> 03:43:03.700
Can't break the lock.

03:43:04.900 --> 03:43:07.860
Or my body weight behind the crowbar two or three times then.

03:43:09.380 --> 03:43:10.740
There's a sound of metal breaking.

03:43:11.620 --> 03:43:12.100
What?

03:43:13.220 --> 03:43:15.060
Crowbar snaps completely into two pieces!

03:43:15.940 --> 03:43:16.340
Shit.

03:43:18.740 --> 03:43:20.980
Lost crowbar and got broken crowbar.

03:43:22.340 --> 03:43:23.860
Too much force, old man.

03:43:23.860 --> 03:43:25.860
At least the lock up busted too.

03:43:25.860 --> 03:43:26.180
Good.

03:43:26.980 --> 03:43:28.340
Hurry it up and look inside.

03:43:29.940 --> 03:43:31.460
But you're going inside with me, right?

03:43:36.180 --> 03:43:37.540
You overdid it, man.

03:43:37.540 --> 03:43:38.260
The door's a mess.

03:43:38.260 --> 03:43:39.780
You made it even harder to open now.

03:43:40.740 --> 03:43:42.340
Push the door open and step inside.

03:43:43.940 --> 03:43:45.220
Only to run into something.

03:43:47.300 --> 03:43:48.740
Stop, stop!

03:43:48.740 --> 03:43:49.940
Don't come close, any closer.

03:43:53.780 --> 03:43:55.780
If you come any closer, I'll sue.

03:43:57.060 --> 03:43:59.700
A woman has backed up in a defensive stance.

03:44:02.100 --> 03:44:04.660
I'm a black belt in Taekwondo.

03:44:06.260 --> 03:44:08.100
Oh, okay, we have a normal woman.

03:44:10.740 --> 03:44:17.460
If you try anything, Al.

03:44:19.140 --> 03:44:20.100
Shut up, old lady!

03:44:22.180 --> 03:44:23.380
Shut up, old lady!

03:44:25.220 --> 03:44:26.100
Old?

03:44:27.140 --> 03:44:32.180
At Chills' Roar, the woman treaks and falls silent eyes wide.

03:44:32.180 --> 03:44:34.340
Incredibly rude, but honestly, I'm grateful.

03:44:34.580 --> 03:44:42.100
We wait for the woman to calm down before asking what she's doing here.

03:44:48.420 --> 03:44:50.980
Forgive me, it was all a misunderstanding on my part.

03:44:52.660 --> 03:44:56.740
I'm Kristi Arimura, freelance news anchor.

03:44:57.780 --> 03:44:59.300
Oh, I haven't done much recently.

03:45:00.740 --> 03:45:01.780
Wait, I've seen you!

03:45:01.780 --> 03:45:03.780
You're the woman that was in the news!

03:45:04.420 --> 03:45:05.460
Wow, that's really true!

03:45:05.460 --> 03:45:07.540
Celebrity is on a more beautiful person!

03:45:17.220 --> 03:45:19.540
Get that out, this isn't the time for flattery.

03:45:22.580 --> 03:45:25.060
She says that, but she doesn't sound that upset.

03:45:26.340 --> 03:45:27.940
She seems to love being complimented.

03:45:28.500 --> 03:45:30.580
Speaking of senpai...

03:45:30.980 --> 03:45:34.980
Oh, where's my compliment?

03:45:47.700 --> 03:45:48.820
Kohai's cute, yay!

03:45:50.260 --> 03:45:51.300
Best Kohai.

03:45:51.300 --> 03:45:52.740
Beautiful mercy, yeah.

03:45:58.180 --> 03:45:59.380
Yeah, that's the stuff.

03:46:00.580 --> 03:46:05.380
Thank you, thank you senpai!

03:46:19.700 --> 03:46:20.580
Yay!

03:46:20.580 --> 03:46:22.580
Aww, senpais!

03:46:22.580 --> 03:46:23.940
Senpais are so nice to me.

03:46:24.500 --> 03:46:25.540
Yay, thank you!

03:46:25.860 --> 03:46:32.740
Um, anyway, what are you doing here?

03:46:35.700 --> 03:46:36.900
Your expression clouds over.

03:46:38.340 --> 03:46:40.820
Well, feel huffed at me.

03:46:42.020 --> 03:46:43.460
You really have to ask!

03:46:45.300 --> 03:46:47.300
You lost your tack in your old age!

03:46:52.180 --> 03:46:54.260
Masao Kimura's face comes to mind.

03:46:56.500 --> 03:46:58.260
That's right, this place is...

03:47:01.620 --> 03:47:02.900
I was going to die.

03:47:06.900 --> 03:47:09.380
Yes, I know, full well just how stupid that is.

03:47:10.180 --> 03:47:12.580
But sometimes that's the only choice you have left.

03:47:13.940 --> 03:47:17.540
I shouldn't have known better of such a thoughtless question past my lips.

03:47:18.100 --> 03:47:20.260
Wow, we really have no riz.

03:47:20.820 --> 03:47:22.020
Zero, none!

03:47:25.540 --> 03:47:39.860
It's a woman, so you know how to de-escalate, right?

03:47:39.860 --> 03:47:40.180
No!

03:47:44.020 --> 03:47:46.260
We are so riz-less senpais.

03:47:47.380 --> 03:47:48.180
How could we?

03:47:48.260 --> 03:47:56.500
I wish I could blame the mark for this.

03:47:57.860 --> 03:48:01.060
Oh yeah, I heard something about you fooling around with another celebrity.

03:48:04.900 --> 03:48:08.660
Like, is call- is- is call-hi-mercy?

03:48:08.660 --> 03:48:09.300
Riz-less?

03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:11.060
No, we are riz-less.

03:48:13.460 --> 03:48:14.980
Not that I care about that stuff.

03:48:15.700 --> 03:48:20.420
That's why I came out here, so I wouldn't cause trouble for anyone.

03:48:25.380 --> 03:48:28.580
At the very end, I thought about calling someone, but couldn't so...

03:48:32.260 --> 03:48:33.140
I made up my mind.

03:48:33.700 --> 03:48:35.140
But- but then in the forest...

03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:37.460
I have a bad feeling about this.

03:48:41.140 --> 03:48:43.700
What was... in the forest?

03:48:45.620 --> 03:48:49.220
A huge man.

03:48:49.220 --> 03:48:50.980
An extremely huge man.

03:48:53.620 --> 03:48:56.820
I don't know, I'm not even sure if he was really human or not.

03:48:58.820 --> 03:49:00.980
But I saw a figure like that.

03:49:00.980 --> 03:49:02.100
I suddenly got scared.

03:49:03.140 --> 03:49:04.340
I ran into this cottage.

03:49:05.140 --> 03:49:07.300
I'm here to kill myself and I just run from danger.

03:49:07.300 --> 03:49:08.020
I'm a riot.

03:49:11.700 --> 03:49:13.060
What- what's wrong?

03:49:13.060 --> 03:49:14.340
You two aren't saying anything.

03:49:15.940 --> 03:49:18.020
That's the same as what I-

03:49:19.460 --> 03:49:19.700
Yeah.

03:49:21.060 --> 03:49:22.500
Christy must have seen shimmy-o.

03:49:23.140 --> 03:49:24.420
Which means she must also.

03:49:25.860 --> 03:49:27.460
You got in a weird scar recently.

03:49:32.180 --> 03:49:33.780
One that stings every now and then.

03:49:37.300 --> 03:49:39.140
I know the answer just from her reaction.

03:49:40.660 --> 03:49:41.300
How'd you know?

03:49:42.420 --> 03:49:44.020
I- I only just noticed it myself.

03:49:44.100 --> 03:49:46.020
There's a strange bite mark on my palm.

03:49:49.780 --> 03:49:50.660
This is crazy.

03:49:52.980 --> 03:49:55.860
Someone receives the mark when they're already planning suicide.

03:49:55.860 --> 03:49:57.700
The height of irony.

03:50:01.380 --> 03:50:03.300
Hey old man, what are we supposed to do now?

03:50:03.860 --> 03:50:06.260
That lady came to offer self, you know?

03:50:07.060 --> 03:50:08.340
There any point in helping her?

03:50:09.300 --> 03:50:11.620
Well, what if she changed her mind?

03:50:11.620 --> 03:50:12.100
Shut up!

03:50:14.980 --> 03:50:15.860
Help me!

03:50:15.860 --> 03:50:17.300
I'm not going to kill myself anymore.

03:50:17.300 --> 03:50:19.380
I swear, so please, I'm terrified of him.

03:50:21.860 --> 03:50:22.820
Her eyes are serious.

03:50:22.820 --> 03:50:24.020
She must mean what she says.

03:50:24.900 --> 03:50:26.980
I only be a temporary change of heart, but...

03:50:28.260 --> 03:50:29.460
Alright, we'll help you.

03:50:30.500 --> 03:50:32.100
Our home base is Kujo Mansion.

03:50:32.100 --> 03:50:32.900
You need to go.

03:50:41.620 --> 03:50:43.220
Stop messing with the flies!

03:50:44.020 --> 03:50:44.740
Ashlight, old man!

03:50:49.300 --> 03:50:49.940
Sampai!

03:50:54.740 --> 03:50:55.460
What's happening?

03:50:58.820 --> 03:50:59.300
Sampai's...

03:51:00.420 --> 03:51:01.140
We might be...

03:51:02.020 --> 03:51:02.980
We're in thwobble.

03:51:04.180 --> 03:51:05.060
I'm in danger!

03:51:08.820 --> 03:51:09.700
Well, I won't turn on.

03:51:14.020 --> 03:51:16.020
What's happened before about back then?

03:51:24.020 --> 03:51:26.020
I got it to go back on right away.

03:51:28.020 --> 03:51:30.020
Aaaaaaahhh!

03:51:34.020 --> 03:51:36.020
I got it to go back on right away.

03:51:38.020 --> 03:51:40.020
Aaaaaaahhh!

03:51:44.980 --> 03:51:46.020
But this time, it's not working.

03:51:48.020 --> 03:51:48.980
Aaaaaaahhh!

03:51:50.020 --> 03:51:50.820
What was that?

03:51:54.020 --> 03:51:56.020
Aaaaaaahhh!

03:51:58.020 --> 03:52:00.020
No, I'm from behind the cottage!

03:52:00.020 --> 03:52:02.020
Is something there?

03:52:02.020 --> 03:52:04.020
Shit, there's no use.

03:52:04.020 --> 03:52:08.020
I gave up on the flashlight and stuff it in my bag.

03:52:08.020 --> 03:52:09.020
What's the plan now?

03:52:09.020 --> 03:52:10.020
Do we bunker down in this cottage?

03:52:10.020 --> 03:52:11.020
We can't even lie.

03:52:11.020 --> 03:52:13.020
We have to run out of the forest.

03:52:15.020 --> 03:52:17.020
Are you insane?

03:52:23.020 --> 03:52:25.020
This day here will be suicide.

03:52:27.020 --> 03:52:29.020
This place is strangely clean.

03:52:29.020 --> 03:52:31.020
That means someone is coming here.

03:52:31.020 --> 03:52:33.020
I mean, she comes here?

03:52:33.020 --> 03:52:35.020
Let's go. We walked all the way here.

03:52:35.020 --> 03:52:37.020
We should know how to get back.

03:52:39.020 --> 03:52:41.020
You're seriously going? Are you mad?

03:52:41.020 --> 03:52:43.020
Sorry, but we're out of time.

03:52:43.020 --> 03:52:45.020
Stay here if you want. I won't stop you.

03:52:45.020 --> 03:52:47.020
Aaaaaaahhh!

03:52:49.020 --> 03:52:51.020
Step out of pitch-clackness.

03:52:51.020 --> 03:52:53.020
Damn it, I can hardly see.

03:52:53.020 --> 03:52:55.020
We need to go straight.

03:52:55.020 --> 03:52:57.020
We need to get out of here.

03:52:57.020 --> 03:52:59.020
Step out of pitch-clackness.

03:52:59.020 --> 03:53:01.020
Damn it, I can hardly see.

03:53:01.020 --> 03:53:03.020
We need to go straight back

03:53:03.020 --> 03:53:05.020
to the entrance with no detours.

03:53:17.020 --> 03:53:21.020
I was lost on the way here, so...

03:53:23.020 --> 03:53:25.020
I don't know.

03:53:27.020 --> 03:53:29.020
Not as bad as you think it is.

03:53:29.020 --> 03:53:31.020
Ah, shit.

03:53:33.020 --> 03:53:35.020
We've got no idea where he could be waiting.

03:53:37.020 --> 03:53:39.020
You remember the way, right, Mercy?

03:53:39.020 --> 03:53:41.020
I got lost in the middle.

03:53:47.020 --> 03:53:49.020
Where's Leemina Rush?

03:53:49.020 --> 03:53:51.020
I hadn't split them out.

03:53:51.020 --> 03:53:53.020
I would never finish.

03:53:53.020 --> 03:53:55.020
My voice is starting to shake too much.

03:53:55.020 --> 03:53:57.020
Maybe I should save before we're in an entire spot.

03:53:57.020 --> 03:53:59.020
Can I save?

03:53:59.020 --> 03:54:01.020
I'm not at the mansion!

03:54:05.020 --> 03:54:07.020
New info was added to the spirit file.

03:54:07.020 --> 03:54:09.020
A markbearer in a cottage.

03:54:25.020 --> 03:54:27.020
Okay.

03:54:27.020 --> 03:54:29.020
Back.

03:54:33.020 --> 03:54:35.020
We're at a fork already.

03:54:45.020 --> 03:54:47.020
Which way?

03:54:47.020 --> 03:54:49.020
Where do we go?

03:54:51.020 --> 03:54:53.020
I don't remember, Senpai.

03:54:55.020 --> 03:54:57.020
Was it...

03:54:59.020 --> 03:55:01.020
Was it forward?

03:55:03.020 --> 03:55:05.020
Left?

03:55:05.020 --> 03:55:07.020
I don't know if that's right.

03:55:13.020 --> 03:55:15.020
Maybe it is left?

03:55:15.020 --> 03:55:17.020
I think right is the tori gate.

03:55:17.020 --> 03:55:19.020
Left was a bee path.

03:55:19.020 --> 03:55:21.020
Would it be forward then?

03:55:21.020 --> 03:55:23.020
Forward then?

03:55:23.020 --> 03:55:25.020
Oh my gosh.

03:55:25.020 --> 03:55:27.020
Can you read the map?

03:55:31.020 --> 03:55:33.020
I think east.

03:55:33.020 --> 03:55:35.020
We came from the east.

03:55:37.020 --> 03:55:39.020
Never... Which way is east?

03:55:45.020 --> 03:55:47.020
Right, okay.

03:55:47.020 --> 03:55:49.020
Okay.

03:55:49.020 --> 03:55:51.020
Yeah!

03:55:51.020 --> 03:55:53.020
Don't yell, lady!

03:55:53.020 --> 03:55:55.020
Don't yell, lady!

03:55:55.020 --> 03:55:57.020
Something's coming closer.

03:55:57.020 --> 03:55:59.020
We need to get out of here fast.

03:55:59.020 --> 03:56:01.020
Uh...

03:56:01.020 --> 03:56:03.020
East?

03:56:03.020 --> 03:56:05.020
Forward.

03:56:05.020 --> 03:56:07.020
Another fork?

03:56:07.020 --> 03:56:09.020
Which way this time?

03:56:09.020 --> 03:56:11.020
South. It's south!

03:56:11.020 --> 03:56:13.020
The exit should be straight ahead from there.

03:56:15.020 --> 03:56:17.020
Quiet.

03:56:19.020 --> 03:56:23.020
Something's passing through the bushes right by us.

03:56:25.020 --> 03:56:27.020
Now the game tells us that's good.

03:56:35.020 --> 03:56:37.020
Is he following us?

03:56:37.020 --> 03:56:39.020
Even if he was, he is.

03:56:39.020 --> 03:56:41.020
We have to keep going.

03:56:41.020 --> 03:56:45.020
That's no way we can just stand around anymore!

03:56:45.020 --> 03:56:47.020
Right, let's go!

03:56:49.020 --> 03:56:51.020
Move around.

03:56:53.020 --> 03:56:55.020
Move forward.

03:56:55.020 --> 03:56:57.020
Move forward.

03:56:59.020 --> 03:57:01.020
Wait a second.

03:57:01.020 --> 03:57:03.020
No, wait a second.

03:57:03.020 --> 03:57:05.020
I see something stops.

03:57:05.020 --> 03:57:07.020
What's wrong?

03:57:07.020 --> 03:57:09.020
What's coming?

03:57:09.020 --> 03:57:11.020
I'm telling you, someone's coming.

03:57:13.020 --> 03:57:15.020
Not from the darkness jumps.

03:57:15.020 --> 03:57:17.020
Mashita!

03:57:25.020 --> 03:57:27.020
So this is where you were.

03:57:27.020 --> 03:57:29.020
You're closer than I thought.

03:57:33.020 --> 03:57:35.020
Wait, why are you here?

03:57:37.020 --> 03:57:41.020
I had a bad feeling, so I grabbed a car and made my way here.

03:57:41.020 --> 03:57:43.020
Looks like you're in an erupt spot.

03:57:45.020 --> 03:57:47.020
Can you say that again?

03:57:47.020 --> 03:57:49.020
Anyway, we're on our way back.

03:57:49.020 --> 03:57:51.020
Good plan.

03:57:51.020 --> 03:57:53.020
Mashita glances over at Christie.

03:57:53.020 --> 03:57:55.020
Run! Run now!

03:57:55.020 --> 03:57:57.020
Explain later! We gotta get out of here!

03:58:03.020 --> 03:58:05.020
We reach the entrance safe and sound.

03:58:05.020 --> 03:58:09.020
The creepy murderer on the Ark is such a familiar sight now.

03:58:09.020 --> 03:58:13.020
Alright, if we made it this far, then we must be...

03:58:13.020 --> 03:58:15.020
Yeah, it's all good now.

03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:23.020
Christie doesn't move.

03:58:23.020 --> 03:58:25.020
She looks worried, staring off into the forest entrance.

03:58:27.020 --> 03:58:29.020
What's wrong?

03:58:31.020 --> 03:58:33.020
Over there.

03:58:33.020 --> 03:58:35.020
Doesn't it look like someone's there?

03:58:37.020 --> 03:58:39.020
She's looking at the picnic table, hiding in the gloom next to the gate.

03:58:39.020 --> 03:58:41.020
The gaze is drawn over as if by magnets.

03:58:43.020 --> 03:58:45.020
What is...

03:58:45.020 --> 03:58:47.020
No!

03:58:49.020 --> 03:58:51.020
No, we just saved him!

03:58:51.020 --> 03:58:53.020
No!

03:58:55.020 --> 03:58:57.020
Is he having a beer?

03:59:03.020 --> 03:59:05.020
What is that?

03:59:07.020 --> 03:59:09.020
The scene before me is strange.

03:59:09.020 --> 03:59:11.020
No!

03:59:13.020 --> 03:59:15.020
Wait, is he having a beer too?

03:59:15.020 --> 03:59:17.020
Are they drinking beer together?

03:59:17.020 --> 03:59:19.020
That's kind of nice, but also...

03:59:23.020 --> 03:59:25.020
We just saved him!

03:59:25.020 --> 03:59:27.020
He was gonna have a drink with us!

03:59:33.020 --> 03:59:37.020
The huge misshapen man with beads crawling all over his face.

03:59:37.020 --> 03:59:39.020
The eyes fixate on his mouth.

03:59:39.020 --> 03:59:41.020
Looks like he's laughing.

03:59:43.020 --> 03:59:45.020
My heart thunders painfully,

03:59:45.020 --> 03:59:49.020
and I catch a glimpse of the limp figure sitting beside him.

03:59:53.020 --> 03:59:55.020
It's him, that man.

03:59:55.020 --> 03:59:57.020
He's going to commit suicide.

03:59:57.020 --> 03:59:59.020
Masao Kimura, it's definitely him.

04:00:09.020 --> 04:00:11.020
Control those that are different in exercise.

04:00:13.020 --> 04:00:15.020
That strange voice echoes in my head again.

04:00:15.020 --> 04:00:17.020
My vision warps.

04:00:17.020 --> 04:00:19.020
He's dead?

04:00:19.020 --> 04:00:21.020
Kimura's dead?

04:00:21.020 --> 04:00:23.020
What? Why is he on that bench?

04:00:25.020 --> 04:00:27.020
My legs give out when I finally focus enough.

04:00:27.020 --> 04:00:29.020
I find myself kneeling on the ground.

04:00:31.020 --> 04:00:33.020
Oh man, keep it together!

04:00:33.020 --> 04:00:35.020
It's still okay, he hasn't seen us!

04:00:39.020 --> 04:00:41.020
We have to escape while we can.

04:00:41.020 --> 04:00:43.020
You see, he's completely out of it.

04:00:43.020 --> 04:00:45.020
She won't move an inch unless someone drags her.

04:00:47.020 --> 04:00:49.020
Let's go.

04:00:49.020 --> 04:00:51.020
We're going to the parking lot.

04:00:53.020 --> 04:00:55.020
You bring her.

04:00:55.020 --> 04:00:57.020
You got it!

04:00:59.020 --> 04:01:01.020
Come on, Mashita, let's go.

04:01:05.020 --> 04:01:07.020
Mashita?

04:01:07.020 --> 04:01:09.020
Mashita?

04:01:11.020 --> 04:01:13.020
He's gone.

04:01:13.020 --> 04:01:15.020
Took my eyes off him for two seconds

04:01:15.020 --> 04:01:17.020
and he's not by the bench anymore.

04:01:21.020 --> 04:01:23.020
The machine growls

04:01:23.020 --> 04:01:25.020
and the undergrowth near us rustles.

04:01:27.020 --> 04:01:29.020
Yeah, he's right there!

04:01:29.020 --> 04:01:31.020
Run!

04:01:31.020 --> 04:01:33.020
Mashita yells, scrambling away.

04:01:33.020 --> 04:01:35.020
The hollow

04:01:35.020 --> 04:01:37.020
bang rings out from behind me.

04:01:37.020 --> 04:01:39.020
A gunshot?

04:01:39.020 --> 04:01:41.020
Must be Mashita.

04:01:41.020 --> 04:01:43.020
I had no idea he had a gun.

04:01:45.020 --> 04:01:47.020
I dive head first into the car,

04:01:47.020 --> 04:01:49.020
slamming my head accidentally into the steering wheel.

04:01:51.020 --> 04:01:53.020
Mashita tumbles into the passenger's

04:01:53.020 --> 04:01:55.020
seat last.

04:01:57.020 --> 04:01:59.020
He didn't tell me he had a gun.

04:01:59.020 --> 04:02:01.020
Why would I tell you? No time to talk now.

04:02:01.020 --> 04:02:03.020
Just hit the gas.

04:02:03.020 --> 04:02:05.020
I'm trying!

04:02:05.020 --> 04:02:07.020
Engine won't start.

04:02:07.020 --> 04:02:09.020
Shit, shit.

04:02:09.020 --> 04:02:11.020
Oh, oh man, what are you doing?

04:02:11.020 --> 04:02:13.020
Mashita looks through the front windshield

04:02:13.020 --> 04:02:15.020
at the figure approaching.

04:02:15.020 --> 04:02:17.020
Hurry it up, he's coming!

04:02:17.020 --> 04:02:19.020
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

04:02:19.020 --> 04:02:21.020
Shoot the fucking shit!

04:02:21.020 --> 04:02:23.020
Shoot, shoot it!

04:02:23.020 --> 04:02:25.020
Shoot the fucking thing!

04:02:25.020 --> 04:02:27.020
Wait, Christy cowards in the back seat

04:02:27.020 --> 04:02:29.020
her head and her hands.

04:02:29.020 --> 04:02:31.020
He's gone.

04:02:33.020 --> 04:02:35.020
Something bombed the hood of the car,

04:02:35.020 --> 04:02:37.020
the whole vehicle rocked violently.

04:02:37.020 --> 04:02:39.020
Then...

04:02:39.020 --> 04:02:41.020
it turned on.

04:02:43.020 --> 04:02:45.020
Go, let's get the hell out of here!

04:02:49.020 --> 04:02:51.020
Tire squealing, we race out of the parking lot.

04:02:59.020 --> 04:03:01.020
An unspeakable sense of relief

04:03:01.020 --> 04:03:03.020
fills the car.

04:03:05.020 --> 04:03:07.020
If feeling truly alive

04:03:07.020 --> 04:03:09.020
is a real sensation,

04:03:09.020 --> 04:03:11.020
then it most definitely feels like this.

04:03:13.020 --> 04:03:15.020
Where sees Toyota did it?

04:03:15.020 --> 04:03:17.020
My car would never,

04:03:17.020 --> 04:03:19.020
unless it's winter,

04:03:19.020 --> 04:03:21.020
would never not start.

04:03:23.020 --> 04:03:25.020
The greatest irony is that the only time

04:03:25.020 --> 04:03:27.020
you can feel truly alive

04:03:27.020 --> 04:03:29.020
is when you have a brush with death.

04:03:31.020 --> 04:03:33.020
No one speaks for a while,

04:03:33.020 --> 04:03:35.020
we're all soaking in that feeling.

04:03:39.020 --> 04:03:41.020
Why is it more cooperative in winter?

04:03:41.020 --> 04:03:43.020
It's uncooperative in winter,

04:03:43.020 --> 04:03:45.020
so...

04:03:45.020 --> 04:03:47.020
So it can

04:03:47.020 --> 04:03:49.020
have trouble starting in winter

04:03:49.020 --> 04:03:51.020
and you have to probably jump start it.

04:03:53.020 --> 04:03:55.020
Yeah.

04:03:57.020 --> 04:03:59.020
It's just a problem for everyone.

04:04:01.020 --> 04:04:03.020
It's only after we've left the mountain

04:04:03.020 --> 04:04:05.020
and reached buildings again that I feel like talking.

04:04:07.020 --> 04:04:09.020
Still,

04:04:09.020 --> 04:04:11.020
I glance through the rear view mirror

04:04:11.020 --> 04:04:13.020
and then at the passenger seat,

04:04:13.020 --> 04:04:15.020
both Maschita and Sho are looking out their windows.

04:04:17.020 --> 04:04:19.020
Is it really okay for you to come here?

04:04:19.020 --> 04:04:21.020
Mary finds out.

04:04:21.020 --> 04:04:23.020
Obviously I came with her permission.

04:04:27.020 --> 04:04:29.020
Maschita immediately retorts.

04:04:29.020 --> 04:04:31.020
If I hadn't,

04:04:31.020 --> 04:04:33.020
I wouldn't have come.

04:04:33.020 --> 04:04:35.020
I get it.

04:04:35.020 --> 04:04:37.020
Mary must have also guessed that we were in danger.

04:04:39.020 --> 04:04:41.020
So,

04:04:41.020 --> 04:04:43.020
what happened to that ex...

04:04:43.020 --> 04:04:45.020
So what happened to that explanation?

04:04:45.020 --> 04:04:47.020
Who's that woman behind us?

04:04:47.020 --> 04:04:49.020
Alright.

04:04:49.020 --> 04:04:51.020
I tell him everything I know so far

04:04:51.020 --> 04:04:53.020
about Christy Adimura.

04:04:53.020 --> 04:04:55.020
She offers up some details as well.

04:04:55.020 --> 04:04:57.020
The moment her background comes to light,

04:04:57.020 --> 04:04:59.020
Maschita smiles coldly.

04:04:59.020 --> 04:05:01.020
Adimura?

04:05:01.020 --> 04:05:03.020
Right now that you mentioned it,

04:05:03.020 --> 04:05:05.020
I do remember you.

04:05:07.020 --> 04:05:09.020
Oh yeah.

04:05:09.020 --> 04:05:11.020
Thank goodness Maschita was there

04:05:11.020 --> 04:05:13.020
and thank goodness he has a gun!

04:05:17.020 --> 04:05:19.020
We're fired over that scandal.

04:05:21.020 --> 04:05:23.020
Why? I never...

04:05:23.020 --> 04:05:25.020
Can I be disgusted or amazed at his rudeness?

04:05:29.020 --> 04:05:31.020
But these scars you...

04:05:31.020 --> 04:05:33.020
But these scars you all had.

04:05:33.020 --> 04:05:35.020
What are they called?

04:05:35.020 --> 04:05:37.020
Marks.

04:05:37.020 --> 04:05:39.020
Thanks. So, all of you have these marks.

04:05:41.020 --> 04:05:43.020
What happens when you have one?

04:05:43.020 --> 04:05:45.020
Well...

04:05:47.020 --> 04:05:49.020
Maschita butts in from the passenger seat.

04:05:49.020 --> 04:05:51.020
You die within a few days time.

04:05:53.020 --> 04:05:55.020
Suffering from something like amnesia.

04:05:55.020 --> 04:05:57.020
You zone out. Your brain takes a vacation.

04:05:57.020 --> 04:05:59.020
It all happened to me.

04:06:01.020 --> 04:06:03.020
Show scoffs.

04:06:03.020 --> 04:06:05.020
You talk like it's someone else's problem.

04:06:07.020 --> 04:06:09.020
Maschita didn't mean it like that.

04:06:09.020 --> 04:06:11.020
You can only be blunt when discussing this.

04:06:13.020 --> 04:06:15.020
Doesn't look like show will buy that excuse though.

04:06:19.020 --> 04:06:21.020
Yes. Yes, it's really not your problem.

04:06:21.020 --> 04:06:23.020
After all, you don't have a mark anymore.

04:06:25.020 --> 04:06:27.020
Oh. What's he talking about?

04:06:27.020 --> 04:06:29.020
Oh, well, you see...

04:06:29.020 --> 04:06:31.020
Maschita has already lost

04:06:31.020 --> 04:06:33.020
Hanna Hiko's mark. He's free now.

04:06:37.020 --> 04:06:39.020
So, there's no good reason for him

04:06:39.020 --> 04:06:41.020
to be here with us, but...

04:06:41.020 --> 04:06:43.020
You're putting yourself...

04:06:45.020 --> 04:06:47.020
In danger for the truth?

04:06:47.020 --> 04:06:49.020
I can't believe it. You're like a saint.

04:06:49.020 --> 04:06:51.020
Wait.

04:06:51.020 --> 04:06:53.020
You're putting yourself out there for the truth?

04:06:53.020 --> 04:06:55.020
You're like a saint.

04:06:55.020 --> 04:06:56.020
There you go.

04:06:56.020 --> 04:06:57.020
Christie's exaggerated compliment

04:06:57.020 --> 04:06:59.020
is drowned out by Maschita's sardonic laugh.

04:06:59.020 --> 04:07:01.020
It's nothing that noble.

04:07:03.020 --> 04:07:05.020
But thanks to that,

04:07:05.020 --> 04:07:07.020
I've learned the thing I want...

04:07:07.020 --> 04:07:09.020
I most wanted to know.

04:07:09.020 --> 04:07:11.020
And what's that?

04:07:11.020 --> 04:07:13.020
When and how people get that mark.

04:07:19.020 --> 04:07:21.020
The first time I was oblivious,

04:07:21.020 --> 04:07:23.020
but this time,

04:07:23.020 --> 04:07:25.020
I was aware of it.

04:07:25.020 --> 04:07:27.020
Does he have it again?

04:07:29.020 --> 04:07:31.020
Maschita, you don't mean...

04:07:35.020 --> 04:07:37.020
He gives me his usual crooked smile.

04:07:37.020 --> 04:07:39.020
Grannon shows me his wrist.

04:07:39.020 --> 04:07:41.020
Sure enough, his skin is blemished by a scar

04:07:41.020 --> 04:07:43.020
that looks like a spirit's bite mark.

04:07:45.020 --> 04:07:47.020
Show cries out a look of horror on his face.

04:07:47.020 --> 04:07:49.020
Come on, no way.

04:07:49.020 --> 04:07:51.020
Do you seriously do that?

04:07:53.020 --> 04:07:55.020
Man, give it up already.

04:07:55.020 --> 04:07:57.020
It's someone else's problem, right?

04:07:57.020 --> 04:07:59.020
So just shut it.

04:08:01.020 --> 04:08:03.020
After everything.

04:08:03.020 --> 04:08:05.020
After everything.

04:08:05.020 --> 04:08:07.020
We did.

04:08:07.020 --> 04:08:09.020
He's like, I got it again, just to see

04:08:09.020 --> 04:08:11.020
how you get one.

04:08:11.020 --> 04:08:13.020
Maschita, could I say something?

04:08:13.020 --> 04:08:15.020
What's wrong?

04:08:15.020 --> 04:08:17.020
What's wrong?

04:08:17.020 --> 04:08:19.020
Nothing's wrong.

04:08:19.020 --> 04:08:21.020
You never told me you had a gun.

04:08:21.020 --> 04:08:23.020
Oh, that.

04:08:23.020 --> 04:08:25.020
He laughs scornfully

04:08:25.020 --> 04:08:27.020
and shoves a paper bag into my hands.

04:08:27.020 --> 04:08:29.020
I open the bag and find

04:08:29.020 --> 04:08:31.020
a revolver-style handgun

04:08:31.020 --> 04:08:33.020
at the bottom.

04:08:35.020 --> 04:08:37.020
If you want it taken.

04:08:37.020 --> 04:08:39.020
That's not why I

04:08:39.020 --> 04:08:41.020
Maschita keeps on talking

04:08:41.020 --> 04:08:43.020
without stopping to hear what I have to say.

04:08:43.020 --> 04:08:45.020
It's loaded with five bullets.

04:08:45.020 --> 04:08:47.020
You can hang on to it.

04:08:47.020 --> 04:08:49.020
I promise.

04:08:49.020 --> 04:08:51.020
I promise you what.

04:08:51.020 --> 04:08:53.020
Don't use it on anything other than a spirit.

04:08:53.020 --> 04:08:55.020
Not that there's any proof

04:08:55.020 --> 04:08:57.020
it will work on them.

04:08:57.020 --> 04:08:59.020
We got a gun!

04:09:01.020 --> 04:09:03.020
We, I think, I think

04:09:03.020 --> 04:09:05.020
our main character

04:09:05.020 --> 04:09:07.020
and he should kiss. Yes, I believe so.

04:09:07.020 --> 04:09:09.020
No.

04:09:13.020 --> 04:09:15.020
Of course.

04:09:15.020 --> 04:09:17.020
I have any experience with guns.

04:09:17.020 --> 04:09:19.020
There's no way I would.

04:09:19.020 --> 04:09:21.020
To be fair,

04:09:21.020 --> 04:09:23.020
I really, I don't really know.

04:09:23.020 --> 04:09:25.020
But at the very least, right now,

04:09:25.020 --> 04:09:27.020
I'm not getting the feeling that I can handle a gun.

04:09:29.020 --> 04:09:31.020
But, MC is Senpai.

04:09:31.020 --> 04:09:33.020
Well, Senpai, alternate route, okay?

04:09:33.020 --> 04:09:35.020
This is like, uh, what is it?

04:09:35.020 --> 04:09:37.020
Alternate reality, okay?

04:09:37.020 --> 04:09:39.020
We can write fan fiction!

04:09:43.020 --> 04:09:45.020
Oh.

04:09:55.020 --> 04:09:57.020
Only use it under extreme stress.

04:09:57.020 --> 04:09:59.020
With no experience, you will hit your mark.

04:09:59.020 --> 04:10:01.020
Well, whatever. If I'm there,

04:10:01.020 --> 04:10:03.020
just leave the shooting to me.

04:10:03.020 --> 04:10:05.020
You can face the spirit some other way.

04:10:05.020 --> 04:10:07.020
Yeah, that's how

04:10:07.020 --> 04:10:09.020
it was in elementary two.

04:10:13.020 --> 04:10:15.020
And for God's sake,

04:10:15.020 --> 04:10:17.020
keep it.

04:10:17.020 --> 04:10:19.020
Gun possession gets you three years

04:10:19.020 --> 04:10:21.020
penal labor.

04:10:21.020 --> 04:10:23.020
I'll get hit with one

04:10:23.020 --> 04:10:25.020
to ten myself just for giving it to you.

04:10:25.020 --> 04:10:27.020
And shooting a single bullet

04:10:27.020 --> 04:10:29.020
will get you more than three years,

04:10:29.020 --> 04:10:31.020
if not a life sentence.

04:10:32.020 --> 04:10:34.020
Damn, gun laws in Japan, huh?

04:10:39.020 --> 04:10:41.020
Is that how you're telling me not to use it?

04:10:43.020 --> 04:10:45.020
No, I'm telling you that if it's restricted

04:10:45.020 --> 04:10:47.020
that badly by the law,

04:10:47.020 --> 04:10:49.020
it's got that kind of power.

04:10:53.020 --> 04:10:55.020
Got a handgun.

04:10:55.020 --> 04:10:57.020
Mark?

04:10:57.020 --> 04:10:59.020
This color grows more vivid.

04:10:59.020 --> 04:11:01.020
A few hours left

04:11:01.020 --> 04:11:03.020
till death closes in.

04:11:11.020 --> 04:11:13.020
Welcome back,

04:11:13.020 --> 04:11:15.020
Lord Darling.

04:11:15.020 --> 04:11:17.020
At least I can save now, yeah.

04:11:17.020 --> 04:11:19.020
And I think,

04:11:19.020 --> 04:11:21.020
I think we're good.

04:11:21.020 --> 04:11:23.020
I think we're good.

04:11:23.020 --> 04:11:25.020
I think we're good, Senpai.

04:11:25.020 --> 04:11:27.020
That's a lot of excitement.

04:11:27.020 --> 04:11:29.020
I think that's a good place to

04:11:29.020 --> 04:11:31.020
to stop at. What do you think, Senpai?

04:11:35.020 --> 04:11:37.020
You as well, Lord Cho.

04:11:37.020 --> 04:11:39.020
It appears that the woman with you

04:11:39.020 --> 04:11:41.020
is also a markbearer.

04:11:45.020 --> 04:11:47.020
We introduce Christy

04:11:47.020 --> 04:11:49.020
and then Mary.

04:11:49.020 --> 04:11:51.020
Christy is to fill her in on everything.

04:11:51.020 --> 04:11:53.020
Is this the first stream of this game?

04:11:53.020 --> 04:11:55.020
Um, I have one more

04:11:55.020 --> 04:11:57.020
one more

04:11:57.020 --> 04:11:59.020
before this, where I kind of

04:11:59.020 --> 04:12:01.020
yapped a lot more.

04:12:01.020 --> 04:12:03.020
I yapped a whole lot.

04:12:07.020 --> 04:12:09.020
A mark after your life.

04:12:09.020 --> 04:12:11.020
Memory, loss,

04:12:11.020 --> 04:12:13.020
and the spirits who curse them into the living.

04:12:17.020 --> 04:12:19.020
Feels like a chapter just ended, right?

04:12:21.020 --> 04:12:23.020
Christy accepts her new reality

04:12:23.020 --> 04:12:25.020
surprisingly quickly. Guess it's only natural

04:12:25.020 --> 04:12:27.020
after what she saw in the forest.

04:12:27.020 --> 04:12:29.020
I then update Mary on what we found.

04:12:31.020 --> 04:12:33.020
I see. What a close call

04:12:33.020 --> 04:12:35.020
for you.

04:12:35.020 --> 04:12:37.020
I can hear relief in her voice,

04:12:37.020 --> 04:12:39.020
but why did she let Mashita go?

04:12:39.020 --> 04:12:41.020
If you must know

04:12:41.020 --> 04:12:43.020
after you left,

04:12:43.020 --> 04:12:45.020
Lord Mashita insisted on traveling

04:12:45.020 --> 04:12:47.020
to the forest as well.

04:12:47.020 --> 04:12:49.020
Her eyes look over to Mashita.

04:12:49.020 --> 04:12:51.020
I'm not

04:12:51.020 --> 04:12:53.020
I'm not one to just sit around.

04:12:53.020 --> 04:12:55.020
Mashita shrugs nonchalantly.

04:12:57.020 --> 04:12:59.020
But there, yeah, though

04:12:59.020 --> 04:13:01.020
there are one before this was mostly

04:13:01.020 --> 04:13:03.020
me yapping and doing a bit

04:13:03.020 --> 04:13:05.020
of the first chapter. We finished

04:13:05.020 --> 04:13:07.020
the first chapter

04:13:07.020 --> 04:13:09.020
in the stream and then we started the second

04:13:09.020 --> 04:13:11.020
chapter. So we're still kind

04:13:11.020 --> 04:13:13.020
of in the beginning of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:13:13.020 --> 04:13:15.020
Yeah.

04:13:17.020 --> 04:13:19.020
I'm glad everyone's enjoying

04:13:19.020 --> 04:13:21.020
this. I thought at first people would

04:13:21.020 --> 04:13:23.020
find this kind of boring, but

04:13:23.020 --> 04:13:25.020
but I'm glad that everyone's

04:13:25.020 --> 04:13:27.020
like enjoying it now.

04:13:33.020 --> 04:13:35.020
It was it was quite the issue.

04:13:37.020 --> 04:13:39.020
A selfish attitude like that could

04:13:39.020 --> 04:13:41.020
get all of you, Mark Barris killed.

04:13:43.020 --> 04:13:45.020
I normally

04:13:45.020 --> 04:13:47.020
would have refused.

04:13:49.020 --> 04:13:51.020
Did something

04:13:51.020 --> 04:13:53.020
happen? No.

04:13:53.020 --> 04:13:55.020
I admit I had a foreboding

04:13:55.020 --> 04:13:57.020
feeling. I sense danger

04:13:57.020 --> 04:13:59.020
was closing in on you, Lord

04:13:59.020 --> 04:14:01.020
Darling. So he went

04:14:01.020 --> 04:14:03.020
an emergency measure.

04:14:05.020 --> 04:14:07.020
Lord Mashita

04:14:07.020 --> 04:14:09.020
please know I will not allow

04:14:09.020 --> 04:14:11.020
such a thing a second time.

04:14:11.020 --> 04:14:13.020
Her cool voice is spicier

04:14:13.020 --> 04:14:15.020
than you. Mashita's

04:14:15.020 --> 04:14:17.020
so hard headed. I wonder if she's actually getting

04:14:17.020 --> 04:14:19.020
through to him at all.

04:14:19.020 --> 04:14:21.020
Now, from what you've told me

04:14:23.020 --> 04:14:25.020
you are positive that it was

04:14:25.020 --> 04:14:27.020
Chimio who gave Lord Cho his mark.

04:14:29.020 --> 04:14:31.020
Yeah, yeah

04:14:31.020 --> 04:14:33.020
that ugly monster is definitely the

04:14:33.020 --> 04:14:35.020
huge man I saw that time.

04:14:35.020 --> 04:14:37.020
The fact that I have the mark

04:14:37.020 --> 04:14:39.020
now to prove it.

04:14:39.020 --> 04:14:41.020
Mashita rubs at its wrists

04:14:41.020 --> 04:14:43.020
smirking.

04:14:45.020 --> 04:14:47.020
So, what exactly

04:14:47.020 --> 04:14:49.020
are you planning? Don't tell

04:14:49.020 --> 04:14:51.020
me you're seriously thinking of fighting that thing.

04:14:51.020 --> 04:14:53.020
There's no way you'd win.

04:14:53.020 --> 04:14:55.020
You're completely mad if you think you can.

04:14:57.020 --> 04:14:59.020
She's right. A certain someone awesome.

04:14:59.020 --> 04:15:01.020
Someone's awesome bullet didn't

04:15:01.020 --> 04:15:03.020
even scratch it. We need

04:15:03.020 --> 04:15:05.020
a tank or something to beat that thing.

04:15:09.020 --> 04:15:11.020
The room fall silent.

04:15:17.020 --> 04:15:19.020
I'm sure all of us are thinking about what

04:15:19.020 --> 04:15:21.020
we saw back at the forest.

04:15:21.020 --> 04:15:23.020
I feel so bad for

04:15:23.020 --> 04:15:25.020
Kimura.

04:15:25.020 --> 04:15:27.020
There's no way we can do anything

04:15:27.020 --> 04:15:29.020
about a monster like that.

04:15:29.020 --> 04:15:31.020
You have to leave it to the police.

04:15:33.020 --> 04:15:35.020
You honestly believe they'll do something.

04:15:35.020 --> 04:15:37.020
Go

04:15:37.020 --> 04:15:39.020
and make a suicide pack

04:15:39.020 --> 04:15:41.020
with that naive thinking.

04:15:41.020 --> 04:15:43.020
Believe me out of it.

04:15:43.020 --> 04:15:45.020
What? How dare you?

04:15:45.020 --> 04:15:47.020
No boss.

04:15:47.020 --> 04:15:49.020
This is all high and mighty talk

04:15:49.020 --> 04:15:51.020
coming from you? That mean

04:15:51.020 --> 04:15:53.020
you got an idea how to beat it?

04:15:53.020 --> 04:15:55.020
How the hell would

04:15:55.020 --> 04:15:57.020
I know that?

04:15:57.020 --> 04:15:59.020
When I'm willing to risk my life to find one.

04:15:59.020 --> 04:16:01.020
The shout is

04:16:01.020 --> 04:16:03.020
horse. Probably uneasy.

04:16:03.020 --> 04:16:05.020
Christy shivers.

04:16:05.020 --> 04:16:07.020
So it just glares up Machita.

04:16:07.020 --> 04:16:09.020
Not where silence falls again.

04:16:09.020 --> 04:16:11.020
What are the police going to do?

04:16:11.020 --> 04:16:13.020
The police will just be like

04:16:13.020 --> 04:16:15.020
yeah sure whatever.

04:16:15.020 --> 04:16:17.020
Or die like the

04:16:17.020 --> 04:16:19.020
the freaking

04:16:19.020 --> 04:16:21.020
do you remember the

04:16:21.020 --> 04:16:23.020
the guard?

04:16:23.020 --> 04:16:25.020
Yeah probably not.

04:16:27.020 --> 04:16:29.020
We're wasting

04:16:29.020 --> 04:16:31.020
time. And Machita

04:16:31.020 --> 04:16:33.020
is the police.

04:16:33.020 --> 04:16:35.020
We've got to do something

04:16:35.020 --> 04:16:37.020
but

04:16:43.020 --> 04:16:45.020
What do we do

04:16:45.020 --> 04:16:47.020
Senpai? Do we just

04:16:47.020 --> 04:16:49.020
turn to Mary?

04:16:53.020 --> 04:16:55.020
I'll turn to Mary. I'll be like

04:16:57.020 --> 04:16:59.020
Take charge?

04:17:01.020 --> 04:17:03.020
I don't know. I need more information.

04:17:05.020 --> 04:17:07.020
You want to wear the pants

04:17:07.020 --> 04:17:09.020
and take charge or let Mary handle it?

04:17:09.020 --> 04:17:11.020
Well I want Mary's opinion.

04:17:13.020 --> 04:17:15.020
Pull time? Be dummy?

04:17:15.020 --> 04:17:17.020
No I don't want

04:17:17.020 --> 04:17:19.020
We beat a ghost already. Okay

04:17:19.020 --> 04:17:21.020
True.

04:17:21.020 --> 04:17:23.020
True.

04:17:23.020 --> 04:17:25.020
Maybe she can give us more hints.

04:17:25.020 --> 04:17:27.020
I thought Mary could give us more

04:17:27.020 --> 04:17:29.020
hints.

04:17:31.020 --> 04:17:33.020
Show to us we're awesome.

04:17:33.020 --> 04:17:35.020
Has he been wrong yet?

04:17:37.020 --> 04:17:39.020
Being too reliant

04:17:39.020 --> 04:17:41.020
will make us look weak. Okay fine.

04:17:41.020 --> 04:17:43.020
Fine. Fine.

04:17:43.020 --> 04:17:45.020
I saw majority B1 anyways.

04:17:45.020 --> 04:17:47.020
Fine. Fine. We take charge.

04:17:47.020 --> 04:17:49.020
Fuck it.

04:17:49.020 --> 04:17:51.020
We need to force everyone into action.

04:17:51.020 --> 04:17:53.020
You can think about what we need to do

04:17:53.020 --> 04:17:55.020
while we're walking around.

04:17:55.020 --> 04:17:57.020
Of course.

04:17:57.020 --> 04:17:59.020
We need to take charge.

04:17:59.020 --> 04:18:01.020
We're walking around.

04:18:01.020 --> 04:18:03.020
Going back to the forest.

04:18:05.020 --> 04:18:07.020
I want to learn more about Shemeal.

04:18:07.020 --> 04:18:09.020
I could use some help.

04:18:09.020 --> 04:18:11.020
You say that but

04:18:11.020 --> 04:18:13.020
no way we can find a needle in a haystack.

04:18:15.020 --> 04:18:17.020
Pants equipped.

04:18:17.020 --> 04:18:19.020
We gotta have a clue first.

04:18:23.020 --> 04:18:25.020
Then why don't we check out the B farm

04:18:25.020 --> 04:18:27.020
that's north of H tribe?

04:18:27.020 --> 04:18:29.020
My reports say several people have seen

04:18:29.020 --> 04:18:31.020
Shemeal there.

04:18:31.020 --> 04:18:33.020
Hardly anyone ever goes there now

04:18:33.020 --> 04:18:35.020
with the weird events in the forest.

04:18:35.020 --> 04:18:37.020
Why is a B farm up there?

04:18:39.020 --> 04:18:41.020
A cult called Honey B Family

04:18:41.020 --> 04:18:43.020
used to live on the land.

04:18:43.020 --> 04:18:45.020
Oh my gosh! A cult!

04:18:47.020 --> 04:18:49.020
No one's there though.

04:18:49.020 --> 04:18:51.020
No one's there anymore though.

04:18:51.020 --> 04:18:53.020
How come?

04:18:53.020 --> 04:18:55.020
They

04:18:55.020 --> 04:18:57.020
committed mass suicide.

04:19:01.020 --> 04:19:03.020
Mass suicide in the woods.

04:19:03.020 --> 04:19:05.020
I've heard about it somewhere.

04:19:05.020 --> 04:19:07.020
It's always a cult, huh?

04:19:07.020 --> 04:19:09.020
I should have mentioned something similar

04:19:09.020 --> 04:19:11.020
before we entered the forest.

04:19:13.020 --> 04:19:15.020
Shemeal is obviously a member.

04:19:15.020 --> 04:19:17.020
Maybe the leader, perhaps?

04:19:19.020 --> 04:19:21.020
Tabloids and gossip shows ate it

04:19:21.020 --> 04:19:23.020
up five years ago.

04:19:23.020 --> 04:19:25.020
I've never reviewed the details though,

04:19:25.020 --> 04:19:27.020
so the public doesn't know.

04:19:31.020 --> 04:19:33.020
Oh yeah, I remember that.

04:19:33.020 --> 04:19:35.020
But my club took up all my time

04:19:35.020 --> 04:19:37.020
back then, so I don't know much.

04:19:39.020 --> 04:19:41.020
You seem to know quite a bit about the forest,

04:19:41.020 --> 04:19:43.020
Christie Ari Mora.

04:19:43.020 --> 04:19:45.020
Read up on it to find a Primo spot.

04:19:47.020 --> 04:19:49.020
Don't be an ass.

04:19:49.020 --> 04:19:51.020
I was put in charge of the report,

04:19:51.020 --> 04:19:53.020
and the search.

04:19:57.020 --> 04:19:59.020
Honeybee Family was very

04:19:59.020 --> 04:20:01.020
insular and secretive.

04:20:01.020 --> 04:20:03.020
I heard the mass suicide in

04:20:03.020 --> 04:20:05.020
was all the members following their leader.

04:20:05.020 --> 04:20:07.020
Nudes channels chalked it up

04:20:07.020 --> 04:20:09.020
to their discontent with modern society.

04:20:09.020 --> 04:20:11.020
What happened to the leader?

04:20:11.020 --> 04:20:13.020
Rumors say it was also suicide.

04:20:15.020 --> 04:20:17.020
Though, I saw an old picture of him in.

04:20:17.020 --> 04:20:19.020
He was a huge,

04:20:19.020 --> 04:20:21.020
obese man. It's him! It's him!

04:20:21.020 --> 04:20:23.020
I called it!

04:20:29.020 --> 04:20:31.020
Suddenly, everyone is holding their breath.

04:20:31.020 --> 04:20:33.020
No doubt, we're picturing the same thing.

04:20:35.020 --> 04:20:37.020
The monster at the forest entrance.

04:20:39.020 --> 04:20:41.020
A dead guy's come back to life?

04:20:45.020 --> 04:20:47.020
We want to go to a place

04:20:47.020 --> 04:20:49.020
with a zombie? That's totally insane!

04:20:51.020 --> 04:20:53.020
It's just like the rumors.

04:20:53.020 --> 04:20:55.020
It's just like the rumors say that forest

04:20:55.020 --> 04:20:57.020
is correct. There's no way I could

04:20:57.020 --> 04:20:59.020
just standing there, the voices

04:20:59.020 --> 04:21:01.020
of suicide victims surrounded me.

04:21:01.020 --> 04:21:03.020
Shut the hell up, Hank!

04:21:03.020 --> 04:21:05.020
No more words out of those

04:21:05.020 --> 04:21:07.020
lip flaps!

04:21:07.020 --> 04:21:09.020
Oh!

04:21:15.020 --> 04:21:17.020
Why is he like this?

04:21:25.020 --> 04:21:27.020
Why is he like this?

04:21:27.020 --> 04:21:29.020
Rude.

04:21:31.020 --> 04:21:33.020
But now it's not

04:21:33.020 --> 04:21:35.020
only the forest thus cursed.

04:21:35.020 --> 04:21:37.020
I failed to kill myself and now I'm in

04:21:37.020 --> 04:21:39.020
this mansion. I'm cursed too.

04:21:41.020 --> 04:21:43.020
And so all of

04:21:43.020 --> 04:21:45.020
her mutters have a dark edge.

04:21:47.020 --> 04:21:49.020
Shimeo is somehow connected to

04:21:49.020 --> 04:21:51.020
Honey Bee family, and the key

04:21:51.020 --> 04:21:53.020
to destroying his grudge is going to be there.

04:21:55.020 --> 04:21:57.020
Alright, what are you going to do, old lady?

04:21:57.020 --> 04:21:59.020
You still want to die?

04:21:59.020 --> 04:22:01.020
I'm considering it.

04:22:05.020 --> 04:22:07.020
Hahaha.

04:22:07.020 --> 04:22:09.020
But I'll help you guys

04:22:09.020 --> 04:22:11.020
while I settle on my decision.

04:22:11.020 --> 04:22:13.020
I'll pass on monster fighting.

04:22:15.020 --> 04:22:17.020
Well, you'll help. I'm shocked.

04:22:21.020 --> 04:22:23.020
If you leave your mark alone,

04:22:23.020 --> 04:22:25.020
you won't need to hike back out there.

04:22:27.020 --> 04:22:29.020
Oh, I hate owning strangers.

04:22:29.020 --> 04:22:31.020
Especially pushy guys like you.

04:22:31.020 --> 04:22:33.020
He seems grateful that we saved her.

04:22:35.020 --> 04:22:37.020
There's no reason to refuse her help.

04:22:37.020 --> 04:22:39.020
We need as much as we can get.

04:22:39.020 --> 04:22:41.020
She is pretty sane though.

04:22:41.020 --> 04:22:43.020
Why is everyone in this game so negative?

04:22:43.020 --> 04:22:45.020
Well, everyone's about to die.

04:22:47.020 --> 04:22:49.020
You know, I think that's a pretty good reason.

04:22:49.020 --> 04:22:51.020
Hahaha.

04:23:01.020 --> 04:23:03.020
Lady Christy said Shimeo

04:23:03.020 --> 04:23:05.020
was often seen near the bee farm.

04:23:05.020 --> 04:23:07.020
It may hold a connection to him.

04:23:07.020 --> 04:23:09.020
Good luck.

04:23:15.020 --> 04:23:17.020
New info was added to the spirit file.

04:23:17.020 --> 04:23:19.020
Temporary retreat.

04:23:19.020 --> 04:23:21.020
Let's save some pie.

04:23:23.020 --> 04:23:25.020
They do be having death hanging over their heads.

04:23:31.020 --> 04:23:33.020
I can't remember how, but...

04:23:35.020 --> 04:23:37.020
No, wait. Hold on.

04:23:37.020 --> 04:23:39.020
How do I exit this? Any...

04:23:39.020 --> 04:23:41.020
Hack it.

04:23:41.020 --> 04:23:43.020
Hack it. I think it was...

04:23:43.020 --> 04:23:45.020
X? No.

04:23:45.020 --> 04:23:47.020
Y?

04:23:47.020 --> 04:23:49.020
Yeah, here it is.

04:23:49.020 --> 04:23:51.020
We got it!

04:23:55.020 --> 04:23:57.020
If we turn to Tito's screen,

04:23:57.020 --> 04:23:59.020
all unsaved progress will be lost.

04:23:59.020 --> 04:24:01.020
We saved already, so we're good.

04:24:11.020 --> 04:24:13.020
Yay!

04:24:19.020 --> 04:24:21.020
Yay!

04:24:21.020 --> 04:24:23.020
How was that, Senpai?

04:24:23.020 --> 04:24:25.020
Are you enjoying the game now?

04:24:25.020 --> 04:24:27.020
Hold on. Let me move myself. There we go.

04:24:27.020 --> 04:24:29.020
Did you enjoy the game now?

04:24:29.020 --> 04:24:31.020
Did you enjoy the game now?

04:24:31.020 --> 04:24:33.020
And my chat box is broken.

04:24:33.020 --> 04:24:35.020
And my chat box is broken.

04:24:35.020 --> 04:24:37.020
Man.

04:24:37.020 --> 04:24:39.020
Really fun, right? I'm so glad.

04:24:39.020 --> 04:24:41.020
I know that it's kind of slow

04:24:41.020 --> 04:24:43.020
I know that it's kind of slow

04:24:43.020 --> 04:24:45.020
to start.

04:24:45.020 --> 04:24:47.020
Because I know when I started,

04:24:47.020 --> 04:24:49.020
I ended up yapping a lot.

04:24:49.020 --> 04:24:51.020
But it really ramps up, right?

04:24:51.020 --> 04:24:53.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:24:53.020 --> 04:24:55.020
So I'm glad that everyone's enjoying it.

04:24:57.020 --> 04:24:59.020
So I hope...

04:24:59.020 --> 04:25:01.020
Oh, and there's a sequel to this game, too.

04:25:01.020 --> 04:25:03.020
So maybe we can

04:25:03.020 --> 04:25:05.020
play the sequel

04:25:05.020 --> 04:25:07.020
after we finish this one.

04:25:07.020 --> 04:25:09.020
What do you think?

04:25:09.020 --> 04:25:11.020
Oh my gosh, the Brooklyn Dacons!

04:25:11.020 --> 04:25:13.020
Let's go!

04:25:13.020 --> 04:25:15.020
The sequel, yeah, it's called...

04:25:15.020 --> 04:25:17.020
Okay, so the series is called

04:25:17.020 --> 04:25:19.020
Spirit Hunter.

04:25:19.020 --> 04:25:21.020
This one is Deathmark.

04:25:21.020 --> 04:25:23.020
The sequel is called No Good.

04:25:23.020 --> 04:25:25.020
NG. Spirit Hunter...

04:25:25.020 --> 04:25:27.020
Is it Spirit Hunter?

04:25:27.020 --> 04:25:29.020
Shit.

04:25:29.020 --> 04:25:31.020
Hold on.

04:25:31.020 --> 04:25:33.020
Deathmark.

04:25:33.020 --> 04:25:35.020
Spirit Hunter, yeah.

04:25:35.020 --> 04:25:37.020
Spirit Hunter, the second game is called

04:25:37.020 --> 04:25:39.020
Spirit Hunter NG.

04:25:39.020 --> 04:25:41.020
No Good!

04:25:41.020 --> 04:25:43.020
And there's going to be

04:25:43.020 --> 04:25:45.020
another...

04:25:45.020 --> 04:25:47.020
another one.

04:25:47.020 --> 04:25:49.020
Another one following that.

04:25:49.020 --> 04:25:51.020
That is releasing...

04:25:51.020 --> 04:25:53.020
No.

04:25:53.020 --> 04:25:55.020
It released already, right?

04:25:55.020 --> 04:25:57.020
Spirit Hunter Deathmark 2.

04:25:59.020 --> 04:26:01.020
Did it release already?

04:26:01.020 --> 04:26:03.020
Tenpais, I don't remember.

04:26:03.020 --> 04:26:05.020
I think it's already out, I think.

04:26:05.020 --> 04:26:07.020
Okay, yeah.

04:26:07.020 --> 04:26:09.020
There's another one that comes out.

04:26:09.020 --> 04:26:11.020
Yeah.

04:26:13.020 --> 04:26:15.020
Do you know when Deathmark came out?

04:26:15.020 --> 04:26:17.020
Let me check.

04:26:17.020 --> 04:26:19.020
It came out in both

04:26:19.020 --> 04:26:21.020
English and Japanese

04:26:21.020 --> 04:26:23.020
in April 2019.

04:26:27.020 --> 04:26:29.020
It was apparent...

04:26:29.020 --> 04:26:31.020
It was real 2019.

04:26:31.020 --> 04:26:33.020
It was this one.

04:26:33.020 --> 04:26:35.020
The second one came out in

04:26:35.020 --> 04:26:37.020
2022, yeah.

04:26:37.020 --> 04:26:39.020
And the latest one,

04:26:39.020 --> 04:26:41.020
Deathmark...

04:26:41.020 --> 04:26:43.020
Spirit Hunter Deathmark 2

04:26:43.020 --> 04:26:45.020
came out

04:26:45.020 --> 04:26:47.020
February 15, 2024.

04:26:47.020 --> 04:26:49.020
Yeah.

04:26:51.020 --> 04:26:53.020
So, uh...

04:26:53.020 --> 04:26:55.020
Yeah,

04:26:55.020 --> 04:26:57.020
they had to go into the

04:26:57.020 --> 04:26:59.020
banger title.

04:26:59.020 --> 04:27:01.020
So the game is practically

04:27:01.020 --> 04:27:03.020
brand new, yeah.

04:27:03.020 --> 04:27:05.020
I actually bought it

04:27:05.020 --> 04:27:07.020
when it just came out.

04:27:07.020 --> 04:27:09.020
I bought the original

04:27:09.020 --> 04:27:11.020
limited edition

04:27:11.020 --> 04:27:13.020
because I saw it in stores.

04:27:13.020 --> 04:27:15.020
I saw it at GameStop

04:27:15.020 --> 04:27:17.020
and I was like, yeah!

04:27:17.020 --> 04:27:19.020
This looks cool! I love visual novels!

04:27:19.020 --> 04:27:21.020
And so I bought it

04:27:21.020 --> 04:27:23.020
for a PS4.

04:27:23.020 --> 04:27:25.020
And then I got lazy...

04:27:25.020 --> 04:27:27.020
I got lazy

04:27:27.020 --> 04:27:29.020
and I wanted to stream it

04:27:29.020 --> 04:27:31.020
but I didn't want to plug in my PS4!

04:27:35.020 --> 04:27:37.020
I didn't want to...

04:27:37.020 --> 04:27:39.020
So I bought it again on Steam!

04:27:49.020 --> 04:27:51.020
I double-purchased it

04:27:51.020 --> 04:27:53.020
because I was too lazy to plug it in!

04:27:57.020 --> 04:27:59.020
But yeah, it's because I really wanted to...

04:27:59.020 --> 04:28:01.020
What's the word? I really wanted

04:28:01.020 --> 04:28:03.020
to...

04:28:03.020 --> 04:28:05.020
play...

04:28:05.020 --> 04:28:07.020
play it, but I was like, oh, I'm too lazy.

04:28:07.020 --> 04:28:09.020
I'll probably stop being lazy

04:28:09.020 --> 04:28:11.020
and...

04:28:13.020 --> 04:28:15.020
actually plug in

04:28:15.020 --> 04:28:17.020
my...

04:28:17.020 --> 04:28:19.020
um...

04:28:21.020 --> 04:28:23.020
my...

04:28:25.020 --> 04:28:27.020
my systems?

04:28:27.020 --> 04:28:29.020
My systems? Consoles?

04:28:29.020 --> 04:28:31.020
Yeah, my consoles.

04:28:33.020 --> 04:28:35.020
I bought it for PS4, yeah.

04:28:35.020 --> 04:28:37.020
I don't... I don't have

04:28:37.020 --> 04:28:39.020
the money

04:28:39.020 --> 04:28:41.020
to pay for a PS5.

04:28:43.020 --> 04:28:45.020
Actually, I was for a while

04:28:45.020 --> 04:28:47.020
and I was like, why do I need a PS5?

04:28:47.020 --> 04:28:49.020
And then now I'm just like, oh...

04:28:49.020 --> 04:28:51.020
Well, it's kind of

04:28:51.020 --> 04:28:53.020
backwards compatible, right?

04:28:55.020 --> 04:28:57.020
Just say you're a super fan

04:28:57.020 --> 04:28:59.020
and want to support the franchise even more.

04:28:59.020 --> 04:29:01.020
Am I really a fan

04:29:01.020 --> 04:29:03.020
if I never really played it to the end?

04:29:07.020 --> 04:29:09.020
It's fine, the PS5 has no game.

04:29:09.020 --> 04:29:11.020
Oh, but it's got like...

04:29:11.020 --> 04:29:13.020
nice graphics.

04:29:13.020 --> 04:29:15.020
Right?

04:29:15.020 --> 04:29:17.020
It's got nice graphics.

04:29:21.020 --> 04:29:23.020
And it's backwards and compatible,

04:29:23.020 --> 04:29:25.020
so I thought that maybe

04:29:25.020 --> 04:29:27.020
it would look prettier,

04:29:27.020 --> 04:29:29.020
but I'm not sure

04:29:29.020 --> 04:29:31.020
if it would look prettier at all...

04:29:33.020 --> 04:29:35.020
at all for...

04:29:37.020 --> 04:29:39.020
if it would make a difference,

04:29:39.020 --> 04:29:41.020
you know, Senpai?

04:29:44.020 --> 04:29:47.020
If I'm going to stream it through my PC,

04:29:47.020 --> 04:29:49.020
I think it wouldn't

04:29:49.020 --> 04:29:51.020
make that much of a difference, right?

04:29:53.020 --> 04:29:55.020
At least, I don't think so.

04:29:55.020 --> 04:29:57.020
Probably not, so that's why

04:29:57.020 --> 04:29:59.020
in my mind I thought

04:29:59.020 --> 04:30:01.020
um...

04:30:01.020 --> 04:30:03.020
probably not, I probably...

04:30:05.020 --> 04:30:07.020
I probably won't

04:30:09.020 --> 04:30:11.020
won't get a PS5 yet.

04:30:13.020 --> 04:30:15.020
It shouldn't be noticeable, yeah.

04:30:15.020 --> 04:30:17.020
That's why I was like, okay, well,

04:30:17.020 --> 04:30:19.020
if it's not going to improve the stream, I don't need it, right?

04:30:23.020 --> 04:30:25.020
Everyone, PC is better.

04:30:25.020 --> 04:30:27.020
Is your PC as strong as a PS5 though?

04:30:33.020 --> 04:30:35.020
Yeah, PS5 isn't going anywhere

04:30:35.020 --> 04:30:37.020
if you decide to want one later.

04:30:37.020 --> 04:30:39.020
Yeah, I don't... they came out

04:30:39.020 --> 04:30:41.020
of the slim, right?

04:30:43.020 --> 04:30:45.020
Uh...

04:30:45.020 --> 04:30:47.020
Came out the slim, which is slightly

04:30:47.020 --> 04:30:49.020
cheaper, I think?

04:30:57.020 --> 04:30:59.020
Um, right now, for my

04:30:59.020 --> 04:31:01.020
PC, I'm using

04:31:01.020 --> 04:31:03.020
uh...

04:31:03.020 --> 04:31:05.020
an Xbox controller.

04:31:05.020 --> 04:31:07.020
I have two Xbox controllers

04:31:07.020 --> 04:31:09.020
and a PS4 controller,

04:31:09.020 --> 04:31:11.020
a rose gold PS4 controller.

04:31:14.020 --> 04:31:16.020
So, I don't know.

04:31:22.020 --> 04:31:24.020
Um...

04:31:24.020 --> 04:31:26.020
Yeah, I have the rose gold one.

04:31:26.020 --> 04:31:27.020
I got it

04:31:27.020 --> 04:31:29.020
when I was on sale.

04:31:29.020 --> 04:31:31.020
Oh yeah,

04:31:31.020 --> 04:31:33.020
Senpai, did you know that my first

04:31:33.020 --> 04:31:35.020
home console was

04:31:35.020 --> 04:31:37.020
a PS4?

04:31:39.020 --> 04:31:41.020
My home... my first home console was a PS4.

04:31:41.020 --> 04:31:43.020
Yeah, I think I told some Senpai's

04:31:43.020 --> 04:31:45.020
earlier.

04:31:45.020 --> 04:31:47.020
Yeah, like in a different stream.

04:31:47.020 --> 04:31:49.020
I don't remember which stream, but I said...

04:31:49.020 --> 04:31:51.020
My first console was a...

04:31:51.020 --> 04:31:53.020
was a PS4.

04:32:01.020 --> 04:32:03.020
Only handhelds before?

04:32:03.020 --> 04:32:05.020
Yeah, my first handheld was

04:32:05.020 --> 04:32:07.020
a DS... DS Lite, actually.

04:32:07.020 --> 04:32:09.020
And then,

04:32:09.020 --> 04:32:11.020
my second one

04:32:11.020 --> 04:32:13.020
was...

04:32:13.020 --> 04:32:15.020
a Vita?

04:32:15.020 --> 04:32:17.020
Like a PS Vita?

04:32:17.020 --> 04:32:19.020
And then...

04:32:19.020 --> 04:32:21.020
And then I got a PSP,

04:32:21.020 --> 04:32:23.020
finally.

04:32:23.020 --> 04:32:25.020
Because it was on sale, because

04:32:25.020 --> 04:32:27.020
PS Vita came out.

04:32:27.020 --> 04:32:29.020
And then...

04:32:31.020 --> 04:32:33.020
Honestly,

04:32:33.020 --> 04:32:35.020
the Vita was so good, that thing never

04:32:35.020 --> 04:32:37.020
died on me. That thing never died.

04:32:37.020 --> 04:32:39.020
I left it for months, and it still had

04:32:39.020 --> 04:32:41.020
70% batteries. Holy shit.

04:32:45.020 --> 04:32:47.020
That was really good. That thing was good.

04:32:47.020 --> 04:32:49.020
I have the...

04:32:51.020 --> 04:32:53.020
the first gen of the PS Vita,

04:32:53.020 --> 04:32:55.020
so it's super good.

04:32:55.020 --> 04:32:57.020
It's got the beautiful screen.

04:32:59.020 --> 04:33:01.020
They updated the screen to be

04:33:01.020 --> 04:33:03.020
a lower quality, so it's had a lower price.

04:33:03.020 --> 04:33:05.020
But like the first one? Yeah, the OLED.

04:33:05.020 --> 04:33:07.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have that one.

04:33:07.020 --> 04:33:09.020
That was my second one, because

04:33:09.020 --> 04:33:11.020
it came out, and

04:33:11.020 --> 04:33:13.020
I saw the color, it was white,

04:33:13.020 --> 04:33:15.020
and I was like, oh, pretty!

04:33:15.020 --> 04:33:17.020
That's why I got it!

04:33:21.020 --> 04:33:23.020
So I got it, and I thought it was so nice.

04:33:23.020 --> 04:33:25.020
It came with, um...

04:33:25.020 --> 04:33:27.020
Assassin's Creed Liberation, I think.

04:33:29.020 --> 04:33:31.020
It's also great

04:33:31.020 --> 04:33:33.020
when you connect it to the PS4,

04:33:33.020 --> 04:33:35.020
because it acts like another screen

04:33:35.020 --> 04:33:37.020
and another controller. It's really great.

04:33:37.020 --> 04:33:39.020
I don't know, I loved it. I loved it a lot.

04:33:39.020 --> 04:33:41.020
I feel bad that it didn't take off.

04:33:45.020 --> 04:33:47.020
She showed us a picture one day.

04:33:47.020 --> 04:33:49.020
Yeah, I have, um...

04:33:49.020 --> 04:33:51.020
I have some systems,

04:33:51.020 --> 04:33:53.020
but now a friend of mine,

04:33:53.020 --> 04:33:55.020
like one of my gal pals,

04:33:55.020 --> 04:33:57.020
was decluttering.

04:33:57.020 --> 04:33:59.020
And she was like,

04:33:59.020 --> 04:34:01.020
hey,

04:34:01.020 --> 04:34:03.020
you're streaming now, right?

04:34:03.020 --> 04:34:05.020
And I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm streaming now.

04:34:05.020 --> 04:34:07.020
I'm doing streaming stuff.

04:34:07.020 --> 04:34:09.020
And she was like, I have

04:34:09.020 --> 04:34:11.020
all these old consoles.

04:34:11.020 --> 04:34:13.020
I don't need this anymore.

04:34:13.020 --> 04:34:15.020
Do you want them? And so I inherited

04:34:15.020 --> 04:34:17.020
her entire collection.

04:34:17.020 --> 04:34:19.020
And I'm super thankful.

04:34:23.020 --> 04:34:25.020
So I got

04:34:25.020 --> 04:34:27.020
basically every console

04:34:27.020 --> 04:34:29.020
basically

04:34:29.020 --> 04:34:31.020
every console now.

04:34:33.020 --> 04:34:35.020
Are you planning to get a 3DS

04:34:35.020 --> 04:34:37.020
capture card for SMT4?

04:34:37.020 --> 04:34:39.020
I don't know.

04:34:39.020 --> 04:34:41.020
The guy who did like

04:34:41.020 --> 04:34:43.020
DS capture stuff

04:34:43.020 --> 04:34:45.020
doesn't make them anymore, right?

04:34:47.020 --> 04:34:49.020
Sounds like a real homie.

04:34:49.020 --> 04:34:51.020
I hope she gets good things in life. Yeah!

04:34:51.020 --> 04:34:53.020
Is Mercy going to be a

04:34:53.020 --> 04:34:55.020
retro slash nostalgia streamer then?

04:34:55.020 --> 04:34:57.020
I'm hoping

04:34:57.020 --> 04:34:59.020
I can play some games.

04:34:59.020 --> 04:35:01.020
I ordered a retro tank.

04:35:01.020 --> 04:35:03.020
Thank you, Senpai,

04:35:03.020 --> 04:35:05.020
who crowdfunded that.

04:35:05.020 --> 04:35:07.020
Thank you so much.

04:35:07.020 --> 04:35:09.020
I ordered the retro tank already,

04:35:09.020 --> 04:35:11.020
so it should arrive.

04:35:11.020 --> 04:35:13.020
It's still kind of like processing,

04:35:13.020 --> 04:35:15.020
but when it arrives,

04:35:15.020 --> 04:35:17.020
I really want

04:35:17.020 --> 04:35:19.020
to play.

04:35:19.020 --> 04:35:21.020
I really want to play

04:35:21.020 --> 04:35:23.020
on the Wii.

04:35:25.020 --> 04:35:27.020
On the Wii.

04:35:27.020 --> 04:35:29.020
No more heroes,

04:35:29.020 --> 04:35:31.020
so I can use

04:35:31.020 --> 04:35:33.020
the Wii remote.

04:35:37.020 --> 04:35:39.020
It has the speaker.

04:35:39.020 --> 04:35:41.020
I heard you can use it as

04:35:41.020 --> 04:35:43.020
like a phone.

04:35:43.020 --> 04:35:45.020
And you can hear the voices

04:35:45.020 --> 04:35:47.020
go through the Wii

04:35:47.020 --> 04:35:49.020
remote speaker. And I think that's real cool.

04:35:49.020 --> 04:35:51.020
I think that's really cool.

04:35:53.020 --> 04:35:55.020
So, that's something

04:35:55.020 --> 04:35:57.020
I want to play. I also have

04:35:57.020 --> 04:35:59.020
a bunch of PS2 games that

04:35:59.020 --> 04:36:01.020
I want to play as well.

04:36:01.020 --> 04:36:03.020
And I think it would be just really

04:36:03.020 --> 04:36:05.020
fun.

04:36:05.020 --> 04:36:07.020
And so

04:36:07.020 --> 04:36:09.020
I thought this...

04:36:09.020 --> 04:36:11.020
I googled it to see how I can capture

04:36:15.020 --> 04:36:17.020
capture the

04:36:17.020 --> 04:36:19.020
the consoles without

04:36:19.020 --> 04:36:21.020
like too much equipment.

04:36:21.020 --> 04:36:23.020
And so I found the retro tank

04:36:23.020 --> 04:36:25.020
and then I was like, oh, it's

04:36:25.020 --> 04:36:27.020
kind of expensive.

04:36:27.020 --> 04:36:29.020
Maybe I'll put it on my list and maybe

04:36:29.020 --> 04:36:31.020
we can crowdfund it together so

04:36:31.020 --> 04:36:33.020
I can give more stuff

04:36:33.020 --> 04:36:35.020
to show more stuff

04:36:35.020 --> 04:36:37.020
to

04:36:37.020 --> 04:36:39.020
to senpais. And I would be able to play

04:36:39.020 --> 04:36:41.020
things on original hardware.

04:36:41.020 --> 04:36:43.020
So I would love that.

04:36:43.020 --> 04:36:45.020
I would love to do that.

04:36:47.020 --> 04:36:49.020
So, yeah.

04:36:49.020 --> 04:36:51.020
The Wii is retro?

04:36:51.020 --> 04:36:53.020
How old is the Wii? It should be retro, right?

04:37:05.020 --> 04:37:07.020
The Wii came out in 2006,

04:37:07.020 --> 04:37:09.020
Senpai.

04:37:17.020 --> 04:37:19.020
That's like...

04:37:23.020 --> 04:37:25.020
I forget what year it is.

04:37:25.020 --> 04:37:27.020
What year is it? 2024.

04:37:35.020 --> 04:37:37.020
I can't math.

04:37:37.020 --> 04:37:39.020
It's 18 years old.

04:37:39.020 --> 04:37:41.020
It's legal.

04:37:41.020 --> 04:37:43.020
It's an adult now.

04:37:43.020 --> 04:37:45.020
Okay, Senpai.

04:37:51.020 --> 04:37:53.020
Why did you bait yourself

04:37:53.020 --> 04:37:55.020
into doing math, Mercy? It's because

04:37:55.020 --> 04:37:57.020
I want to prove that it's...

04:37:57.020 --> 04:37:59.020
I hate math,

04:37:59.020 --> 04:38:01.020
but I want to prove that it's

04:38:01.020 --> 04:38:03.020
uh...

04:38:05.020 --> 04:38:07.020
It's uh...

04:38:07.020 --> 04:38:09.020
It's old.

04:38:13.020 --> 04:38:15.020
So...

04:38:25.020 --> 04:38:27.020
Wii is officially legal. Like as an adult

04:38:27.020 --> 04:38:29.020
it's officially like a legal adult, right?

04:38:31.020 --> 04:38:33.020
Um...

04:38:33.020 --> 04:38:35.020
Yeah, so I would love to play like

04:38:35.020 --> 04:38:37.020
PS2 games.

04:38:37.020 --> 04:38:39.020
And...

04:38:39.020 --> 04:38:41.020
I also have like an Xbox.

04:38:41.020 --> 04:38:43.020
I think it's the 360?

04:38:43.020 --> 04:38:45.020
Anyways, I have like so many,

04:38:45.020 --> 04:38:47.020
so many like consoles now.

04:38:47.020 --> 04:38:49.020
I have like SNES.

04:38:51.020 --> 04:38:53.020
I don't think I have a Genesis though.

04:38:53.020 --> 04:38:55.020
I have to check.

04:38:55.020 --> 04:38:57.020
Wait, or maybe I do.

04:38:57.020 --> 04:38:59.020
Oh well, I have like so many.

04:38:59.020 --> 04:39:01.020
I have so many like consoles now

04:39:01.020 --> 04:39:03.020
and I would love to play.

04:39:03.020 --> 04:39:05.020
Just this collection after all.

04:39:05.020 --> 04:39:07.020
It's um...

04:39:11.020 --> 04:39:13.020
It's uh...

04:39:13.020 --> 04:39:15.020
Like my friend gave it to me, right?

04:39:15.020 --> 04:39:17.020
Like she gave it to me.

04:39:17.020 --> 04:39:19.020
That's so nice!

04:39:23.020 --> 04:39:25.020
So that's why I'm just like

04:39:25.020 --> 04:39:27.020
well...

04:39:27.020 --> 04:39:29.020
It was so kind.

04:39:29.020 --> 04:39:31.020
She was so kind enough

04:39:31.020 --> 04:39:33.020
to give it to me, so I should probably

04:39:33.020 --> 04:39:35.020
you know...

04:39:35.020 --> 04:39:37.020
I should probably

04:39:37.020 --> 04:39:39.020
play it, right?

04:39:41.020 --> 04:39:43.020
Like I have so many games now.

04:39:43.020 --> 04:39:45.020
Like so many!

04:39:49.020 --> 04:39:51.020
SNES threatening in some way.

04:39:51.020 --> 04:39:53.020
What do you mean?

04:39:53.020 --> 04:39:55.020
Damn, is your friend single?

04:40:01.020 --> 04:40:03.020
I'm pie.

04:40:03.020 --> 04:40:05.020
I'm pie. Please only look at me.

04:40:11.020 --> 04:40:13.020
Please only look at me, Senpai.

04:40:15.020 --> 04:40:17.020
Please only look at me, Senpai.

04:40:21.020 --> 04:40:23.020
I would greatly appreciate you

04:40:23.020 --> 04:40:25.020
not...

04:40:25.020 --> 04:40:27.020
not moving your eyes

04:40:27.020 --> 04:40:29.020
to someone else.

04:40:29.020 --> 04:40:31.020
Okay?

04:40:35.020 --> 04:40:37.020
I think you need

04:40:37.020 --> 04:40:39.020
some time alone in a barrel.

04:40:39.020 --> 04:40:41.020
Six feet under.

04:40:59.020 --> 04:41:01.020
Oh, they get a breathing tube at least?

04:41:01.020 --> 04:41:03.020
No.

04:41:09.020 --> 04:41:11.020
I'm about to play

04:41:11.020 --> 04:41:13.020
all these nice games

04:41:13.020 --> 04:41:15.020
for Senpais.

04:41:15.020 --> 04:41:17.020
And this is how you treat me?

04:41:17.020 --> 04:41:19.020
Damn!

04:41:23.020 --> 04:41:25.020
Anyways...

04:41:25.020 --> 04:41:27.020
Senpais, ignoring that Senpai.

04:41:31.020 --> 04:41:33.020
Um...

04:41:33.020 --> 04:41:35.020
I think it'll be great

04:41:35.020 --> 04:41:37.020
to play like all these games.

04:41:37.020 --> 04:41:39.020
I want to go through

04:41:39.020 --> 04:41:41.020
my collection of games

04:41:41.020 --> 04:41:43.020
before I

04:41:43.020 --> 04:41:45.020
go through

04:41:45.020 --> 04:41:47.020
any...

04:41:47.020 --> 04:41:49.020
any other...

04:41:49.020 --> 04:41:51.020
any other newer games.

04:41:51.020 --> 04:41:53.020
Unless...

04:41:53.020 --> 04:41:55.020
you know, SMT

04:41:55.020 --> 04:41:57.020
5

04:41:57.020 --> 04:41:59.020
Vengeance

04:41:59.020 --> 04:42:01.020
looking pretty nice right now.

04:42:01.020 --> 04:42:03.020
But I don't want to play it.

04:42:03.020 --> 04:42:05.020
I have to play the

04:42:05.020 --> 04:42:07.020
first one,

04:42:07.020 --> 04:42:09.020
the SMT 5,

04:42:09.020 --> 04:42:11.020
which gives me motion sickness, so I have to take my pills

04:42:11.020 --> 04:42:13.020
or something.

04:42:15.020 --> 04:42:17.020
Vengeance is out. I know!

04:42:17.020 --> 04:42:19.020
I see all these, like,

04:42:19.020 --> 04:42:21.020
screenshots and I'm like,

04:42:21.020 --> 04:42:23.020
it's looking kind of...

04:42:23.020 --> 04:42:25.020
It's looking really great. It looks really great.

04:42:35.020 --> 04:42:37.020
Vengeance is basically 5,

04:42:37.020 --> 04:42:39.020
but better. I mean...

04:42:39.020 --> 04:42:41.020
Uh, yeah, it's...

04:42:43.020 --> 04:42:45.020
Does Minecraft activate your motion sickness?

04:42:45.020 --> 04:42:47.020
Yeah, it does.

04:42:47.020 --> 04:42:49.020
Like, anything kind of first person

04:42:49.020 --> 04:42:51.020
often

04:42:51.020 --> 04:42:53.020
activates the

04:42:53.020 --> 04:42:55.020
the motion sickness. And you know what?

04:42:55.020 --> 04:42:57.020
What is also?

04:42:57.020 --> 04:42:59.020
Um...

04:42:59.020 --> 04:43:01.020
It's not a sequel to 5,

04:43:01.020 --> 04:43:03.020
just an updated version? Seriously?

04:43:05.020 --> 04:43:07.020
I thought it was a sequel

04:43:07.020 --> 04:43:09.020
because it's...

04:43:09.020 --> 04:43:11.020
because it's Apocalypse, right? So...

04:43:11.020 --> 04:43:13.020
SMT 4

04:43:13.020 --> 04:43:15.020
Apocalypse was a completely different cast.

04:43:21.020 --> 04:43:23.020
It's like a completely different cast.

04:43:23.020 --> 04:43:25.020
Like, you play as a completely different character

04:43:25.020 --> 04:43:27.020
and everything.

04:43:27.020 --> 04:43:29.020
It's like Persona 5 Royale

04:43:29.020 --> 04:43:31.020
is an updated

04:43:31.020 --> 04:43:33.020
P5. Seriously?

04:43:35.020 --> 04:43:37.020
Um...

04:43:37.020 --> 04:43:39.020
But I thought it said

04:43:39.020 --> 04:43:41.020
Apocalypse with it!

04:43:41.020 --> 04:43:43.020
But the subtitle

04:43:43.020 --> 04:43:45.020
was also like Apocalypse

04:43:45.020 --> 04:43:47.020
and I thought all of the sequels

04:43:47.020 --> 04:43:49.020
were like Apocalypse.

04:43:49.020 --> 04:43:51.020
Vengeance is just an update?

04:43:51.020 --> 04:43:53.020
Huh...

04:43:59.020 --> 04:44:01.020
Because like,

04:44:01.020 --> 04:44:03.020
SMT 5 made me, like, throw up.

04:44:06.020 --> 04:44:08.020
Made me throw up.

04:44:08.020 --> 04:44:10.020
And another game that

04:44:10.020 --> 04:44:12.020
surprisingly also makes me throw up is Sonic.

04:44:12.020 --> 04:44:14.020
And all Sonic games also

04:44:14.020 --> 04:44:16.020
has like...

04:44:21.020 --> 04:44:23.020
has like, lots of motion

04:44:23.020 --> 04:44:25.020
and like, screen shakes

04:44:25.020 --> 04:44:27.020
that I was like...

04:44:29.020 --> 04:44:31.020
So there's a lot of games that makes me go

04:44:31.020 --> 04:44:33.020
ugh...

04:44:34.020 --> 04:44:36.020
So can you do FPS?

04:44:36.020 --> 04:44:37.020
Uh...

04:44:37.020 --> 04:44:39.020
First person shooter?

04:44:39.020 --> 04:44:41.020
First person?

04:44:45.020 --> 04:44:47.020
So yeah, that's probably...

04:44:47.020 --> 04:44:49.020
something that makes me going

04:44:49.020 --> 04:44:51.020
ugh...

04:44:51.020 --> 04:44:53.020
ugh...

04:44:53.020 --> 04:44:55.020
Mercy throwing upstream?

04:44:55.020 --> 04:44:57.020
Well, at least throwing up is allowed on YouTube.

04:44:57.020 --> 04:44:59.020
On...

04:44:59.020 --> 04:45:01.020
on Twitch, you would be banned for that.

04:45:02.020 --> 04:45:04.020
They banned it!

04:45:06.020 --> 04:45:08.020
Against TOS?

04:45:10.020 --> 04:45:12.020
Yeah, only third person games, realistically.

04:45:12.020 --> 04:45:14.020
Um, Strani did say

04:45:14.020 --> 04:45:17.020
I should expand my gaming repertoire.

04:45:17.020 --> 04:45:19.020
So...

04:45:19.020 --> 04:45:21.020
I'm willing to try

04:45:21.020 --> 04:45:23.020
basically all games.

04:45:31.020 --> 04:45:33.020
Twitch bans you for getting sick?

04:45:33.020 --> 04:45:35.020
Um, and you...

04:45:35.020 --> 04:45:37.020
It's because...

04:45:38.020 --> 04:45:40.020
I believe it's because...

04:45:40.020 --> 04:45:42.020
Okay, okay.

04:45:42.020 --> 04:45:44.020
This is like a story that I think I heard.

04:45:44.020 --> 04:45:46.020
This is the reason why, but I could be wrong.

04:45:47.020 --> 04:45:49.020
But I remember it's because

04:45:49.020 --> 04:45:51.020
someone was

04:45:51.020 --> 04:45:53.020
doing some kind of fetish thing

04:45:53.020 --> 04:45:55.020
where they were throwing up.

04:45:55.020 --> 04:45:57.020
And it was like, pretty dangerous.

04:45:57.020 --> 04:45:59.020
And it was encouraging, like, you know...

04:45:59.020 --> 04:46:01.020
Um...

04:46:01.020 --> 04:46:03.020
Like, it was like...

04:46:03.020 --> 04:46:05.020
doing some fetish thing

04:46:05.020 --> 04:46:07.020
where people were paying them

04:46:07.020 --> 04:46:09.020
to throw up.

04:46:09.020 --> 04:46:11.020
So...

04:46:11.020 --> 04:46:13.020
to take action against that,

04:46:13.020 --> 04:46:15.020
um...

04:46:15.020 --> 04:46:17.020
Twitch was like, okay, you cannot throw

04:46:17.020 --> 04:46:19.020
up on stream then.

04:46:21.020 --> 04:46:23.020
Ahem.

04:46:30.020 --> 04:46:32.020
Hey, Mercy, if you were chill

04:46:32.020 --> 04:46:34.020
with all visual novels out,

04:46:34.020 --> 04:46:36.020
it would be fine too. Um...

04:46:36.020 --> 04:46:38.020
Mostly it was like the point-and-click stuff.

04:46:38.020 --> 04:46:40.020
She was like, I need you to...

04:46:40.020 --> 04:46:42.020
I need you to try more games.

04:46:42.020 --> 04:46:44.020
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I can do that.

04:46:44.020 --> 04:46:46.020
I can do that.

04:46:47.020 --> 04:46:49.020
Is this like the girl

04:46:49.020 --> 04:46:51.020
bottling her farts and getting sick?

04:46:51.020 --> 04:46:53.020
Probably.

04:46:53.020 --> 04:46:55.020
I don't know.

04:46:55.020 --> 04:46:57.020
Would you play

04:46:57.020 --> 04:46:59.020
other games like SMT Devil Survivor

04:46:59.020 --> 04:47:01.020
or Fire Emblem?

04:47:01.020 --> 04:47:03.020
I don't like Devil Survivor.

04:47:03.020 --> 04:47:05.020
I played it on the DS. I have it for the DS.

04:47:05.020 --> 04:47:07.020
I don't like Devil Survivor.

04:47:07.020 --> 04:47:09.020
I just don't like the gameplay mechanic

04:47:09.020 --> 04:47:11.020
of it.

04:47:11.020 --> 04:47:13.020
I did like, uh, what's the one again

04:47:13.020 --> 04:47:15.020
where they have all the massive stuff?

04:47:15.020 --> 04:47:17.020
I don't know, what was the call again?

04:47:19.020 --> 04:47:21.020
Uh...

04:47:27.020 --> 04:47:29.020
Strange Journey.

04:47:29.020 --> 04:47:31.020
Yes, I like Strange Journey though.

04:47:31.020 --> 04:47:33.020
I like Strange Journey.

04:47:35.020 --> 04:47:37.020
And I did like what I played

04:47:37.020 --> 04:47:39.020
for the PS2

04:47:39.020 --> 04:47:41.020
of what I played.

04:47:41.020 --> 04:47:43.020
Did you know Devil Saga

04:47:43.020 --> 04:47:45.020
was good too?

04:47:49.020 --> 04:47:51.020
Uh...

04:47:51.020 --> 04:47:53.020
Strange Journey or Archie and Noah

04:47:53.020 --> 04:47:55.020
are redux. I liked

04:47:55.020 --> 04:47:57.020
both, but I own redux

04:47:57.020 --> 04:47:59.020
and I had to borrow from a friend

04:47:59.020 --> 04:48:01.020
the original Strange Journey.

04:48:03.020 --> 04:48:05.020
Um...

04:48:05.020 --> 04:48:07.020
I didn't like the

04:48:07.020 --> 04:48:09.020
the gameplay mechanics of

04:48:11.020 --> 04:48:13.020
of, uh...

04:48:13.020 --> 04:48:15.020
uh...

04:48:15.020 --> 04:48:17.020
Devil Survivor though. I didn't like that one.

04:48:19.020 --> 04:48:21.020
I just, I know, I know it's like

04:48:21.020 --> 04:48:23.020
people were like, oh well, whatever.

04:48:23.020 --> 04:48:25.020
I just didn't like the like tiles.

04:48:25.020 --> 04:48:27.020
I didn't like it.

04:48:31.020 --> 04:48:33.020
So, that's why I was kind of like

04:48:33.020 --> 04:48:35.020
ehh, no, no thanks.

04:48:37.020 --> 04:48:39.020
Uh, it felt like

04:48:39.020 --> 04:48:41.020
a tactics game and like a,

04:48:41.020 --> 04:48:43.020
you know, like one of those chess tactic games

04:48:43.020 --> 04:48:45.020
or like...

04:48:45.020 --> 04:48:47.020
Uh, like, I'm gonna get,

04:48:47.020 --> 04:48:49.020
I'm gonna get fricking fried for this,

04:48:49.020 --> 04:48:51.020
but I'm not a huge fan of Fire Emblem

04:48:51.020 --> 04:48:53.020
because of like, its chess

04:48:53.020 --> 04:48:55.020
like, tile mechanics.

04:48:57.020 --> 04:48:59.020
Because I was like, uh...

04:48:59.020 --> 04:49:01.020
I don't know.

04:49:01.020 --> 04:49:03.020
Kind of boring.

04:49:05.020 --> 04:49:07.020
It was kind of boring.

04:49:07.020 --> 04:49:09.020
I mean, maybe I'll give it another go,

04:49:09.020 --> 04:49:11.020
but when I played it,

04:49:11.020 --> 04:49:13.020
I didn't like it.

04:49:17.020 --> 04:49:19.020
Like, uh...

04:49:19.020 --> 04:49:21.020
I also, I remember trying to stream

04:49:23.020 --> 04:49:25.020
um...

04:49:27.020 --> 04:49:29.020
Fire Emblem, which one is it? Three Houses?

04:49:29.020 --> 04:49:31.020
And I just could not

04:49:31.020 --> 04:49:33.020
make it entertaining.

04:49:33.020 --> 04:49:35.020
I just could not make it entertaining.

04:49:35.020 --> 04:49:37.020
I mean, I tried.

04:49:37.020 --> 04:49:39.020
Really hard.

04:49:41.020 --> 04:49:43.020
So, yeah.

04:49:45.020 --> 04:49:47.020
I just didn't like the tiles.

04:49:47.020 --> 04:49:49.020
I was like, uh...

04:49:49.020 --> 04:49:51.020
Maybe...

04:49:51.020 --> 04:49:53.020
Maybe I can try it again later,

04:49:53.020 --> 04:49:55.020
but...

04:49:55.020 --> 04:49:57.020
I don't think

04:49:57.020 --> 04:49:59.020
I like that type of gameplay.

04:50:03.020 --> 04:50:05.020
But yeah, I do like SMT though,

04:50:05.020 --> 04:50:07.020
like SMT games as a whole.

04:50:09.020 --> 04:50:11.020
I do have... Oh, I do have...

04:50:11.020 --> 04:50:13.020
I did like, um...

04:50:13.020 --> 04:50:15.020
I did like...

04:50:17.020 --> 04:50:19.020
Devil Summoner.

04:50:19.020 --> 04:50:21.020
That one was good.

04:50:23.020 --> 04:50:25.020
I like that one.

04:50:27.020 --> 04:50:29.020
You take Strange Journey.

04:50:29.020 --> 04:50:31.020
Do you... Do you like Soul Hackers?

04:50:35.020 --> 04:50:37.020
Hold on, give me a minute.

04:50:37.020 --> 04:50:39.020
I never played Soul Hackers, actually.

04:50:39.020 --> 04:50:41.020
That's the only one I didn't...

04:50:43.020 --> 04:50:45.020
That's the only one I didn't play.

04:50:45.020 --> 04:50:47.020
I didn't get to play Soul Hackers.

04:50:47.020 --> 04:50:49.020
That was the only one I didn't...

04:50:49.020 --> 04:50:51.020
I didn't play.

04:50:51.020 --> 04:50:53.020
I was never able to find it.

04:51:01.020 --> 04:51:03.020
I know the second one,

04:51:03.020 --> 04:51:05.020
the Hackers 2 that came out recently,

04:51:05.020 --> 04:51:07.020
has very mixed reviews,

04:51:07.020 --> 04:51:09.020
and it makes me

04:51:09.020 --> 04:51:11.020
hesitant to even pick it up,

04:51:11.020 --> 04:51:13.020
you know?

04:51:15.020 --> 04:51:17.020
I think another game I would love to play

04:51:17.020 --> 04:51:19.020
are the Atelier games.

04:51:19.020 --> 04:51:21.020
So, I'd love to play, like...

04:51:21.020 --> 04:51:23.020
Atelier.

04:51:23.020 --> 04:51:25.020
I know... I know...

04:51:25.020 --> 04:51:27.020
My first Atelier game is not exactly like

04:51:27.020 --> 04:51:29.020
one that...

04:51:29.020 --> 04:51:31.020
Uh...

04:51:31.020 --> 04:51:33.020
That people are like,

04:51:33.020 --> 04:51:35.020
oh, that's not... That's the one that...

04:51:35.020 --> 04:51:37.020
That you... You like?

04:51:37.020 --> 04:51:39.020
So, the one that I liked

04:51:39.020 --> 04:51:41.020
and the one that I played,

04:51:41.020 --> 04:51:43.020
the most of that I really enjoyed

04:51:43.020 --> 04:51:45.020
was Liddy and Soule.

04:51:45.020 --> 04:51:47.020
I don't know, I thought it was cute?

04:51:51.020 --> 04:51:53.020
I thought it was super cute,

04:51:53.020 --> 04:51:55.020
and I thought it was, like, great.

04:51:55.020 --> 04:51:57.020
And then I wanted to play,

04:51:57.020 --> 04:51:59.020
like, Sophie and stuff,

04:51:59.020 --> 04:52:01.020
but I just never had the time to,

04:52:01.020 --> 04:52:03.020
and then I played a bit of Ryza,

04:52:03.020 --> 04:52:05.020
and I was like, oh, yeah, this is great.

04:52:05.020 --> 04:52:07.020
I played, um...

04:52:07.020 --> 04:52:09.020
But then I just didn't have time to pick it up again.

04:52:09.020 --> 04:52:11.020
I bought the Ryza books, though,

04:52:11.020 --> 04:52:13.020
and I loved the art by Noko.

04:52:13.020 --> 04:52:15.020
Noko did a great job

04:52:15.020 --> 04:52:17.020
on all the arts, because I think

04:52:17.020 --> 04:52:19.020
they're a great artist.

04:52:19.020 --> 04:52:21.020
Um...

04:52:21.020 --> 04:52:23.020
I played...

04:52:23.020 --> 04:52:25.020
Atelier...

04:52:25.020 --> 04:52:27.020
Rorona, I think?

04:52:27.020 --> 04:52:29.020
Rorona?

04:52:29.020 --> 04:52:31.020
Not Rorona, sorry.

04:52:31.020 --> 04:52:33.020
Which one is the one with the pink-haired

04:52:33.020 --> 04:52:35.020
daughter... daughter one?

04:52:37.020 --> 04:52:39.020
What's the list of it?

04:52:39.020 --> 04:52:41.020
Not Meridu.

04:52:41.020 --> 04:52:43.020
It's, like, the one

04:52:43.020 --> 04:52:45.020
that's, like, one of them's a kid.

04:52:45.020 --> 04:52:47.020
Uh...

04:52:47.020 --> 04:52:49.020
Shit, what's it called?

04:52:49.020 --> 04:52:51.020
The kid?

04:52:51.020 --> 04:52:53.020
I think? Is it Meridu?

04:52:57.020 --> 04:52:59.020
It's kind of new-ish.

04:52:59.020 --> 04:53:01.020
No, it's not Meridu.

04:53:01.020 --> 04:53:03.020
Hold on.

04:53:03.020 --> 04:53:05.020
List of...

04:53:05.020 --> 04:53:07.020
Atelier games?

04:53:07.020 --> 04:53:09.020
Atelier games? Thank you.

04:53:09.020 --> 04:53:11.020
Uh...

04:53:11.020 --> 04:53:13.020
This one!

04:53:13.020 --> 04:53:15.020
Atelier Lulua!

04:53:15.020 --> 04:53:17.020
I hated Lulua!

04:53:17.020 --> 04:53:19.020
I hated Lulua!

04:53:19.020 --> 04:53:21.020
It was cheap! I was like...

04:53:21.020 --> 04:53:23.020
I feel like I'm playing a stupid phone game!

04:53:23.020 --> 04:53:25.020
What the fuck?

04:53:29.020 --> 04:53:31.020
I know what her keyboard sounds

04:53:31.020 --> 04:53:33.020
is so immaculate.

04:53:33.020 --> 04:53:35.020
Oh yeah, my keyboard, it's, um...

04:53:35.020 --> 04:53:37.020
red switches

04:53:37.020 --> 04:53:39.020
so they don't make that much noise.

04:53:39.020 --> 04:53:41.020
Sorry, Senpai.

04:53:41.020 --> 04:53:43.020
But, like,

04:53:43.020 --> 04:53:45.020
Atelier Lulua was shit garbage.

04:53:45.020 --> 04:53:47.020
I was like, I feel like I'm playing a stupid phone game.

04:53:49.020 --> 04:53:51.020
It was, it wasn't interactive.

04:53:51.020 --> 04:53:53.020
It was no fun.

04:53:53.020 --> 04:53:55.020
I feel like it was rushed.

04:53:55.020 --> 04:53:57.020
It was not good.

04:53:57.020 --> 04:53:59.020
It was not good.

04:54:01.020 --> 04:54:03.020
Like, it looks cute. Like, it looks cute

04:54:03.020 --> 04:54:05.020
as fuck, right?

04:54:05.020 --> 04:54:07.020
Like...

04:54:07.020 --> 04:54:09.020
The design is, uh...

04:54:11.020 --> 04:54:13.020
is, it's cute.

04:54:13.020 --> 04:54:15.020
I thought it would be, like,

04:54:15.020 --> 04:54:17.020
Liddy and Sue

04:54:17.020 --> 04:54:19.020
and it just wasn't there.

04:54:21.020 --> 04:54:23.020
It just wasn't there.

04:54:23.020 --> 04:54:25.020
And I was playing Lulua and I was like,

04:54:25.020 --> 04:54:27.020
oh fuck, this sucks.

04:54:27.020 --> 04:54:29.020
This really fucking sucks.

04:54:29.020 --> 04:54:31.020
Uh...

04:54:31.020 --> 04:54:33.020
And so I just

04:54:33.020 --> 04:54:35.020
didn't want to play

04:54:35.020 --> 04:54:37.020
Lulua.

04:54:37.020 --> 04:54:39.020
After, like, the getting out of the town,

04:54:39.020 --> 04:54:41.020
I was like, and playing a little bit

04:54:41.020 --> 04:54:43.020
in the area, I was like, this fucking sucks.

04:54:47.020 --> 04:54:49.020
So, I didn't enjoy it,

04:54:49.020 --> 04:54:51.020
but I hear Riza is so much better

04:54:51.020 --> 04:54:53.020
and I played a bit of Riza and I think

04:54:53.020 --> 04:54:55.020
I think I enjoyed it.

04:54:55.020 --> 04:54:57.020
I really think I did enjoy

04:54:57.020 --> 04:54:59.020
Riza.

04:54:59.020 --> 04:55:01.020
Uh, but, like, Lulua sucked.

04:55:01.020 --> 04:55:03.020
Uh, Riza.

04:55:03.020 --> 04:55:05.020
And I would love to play, like, Riza 2

04:55:05.020 --> 04:55:07.020
and Riza 3. I have Riza on

04:55:07.020 --> 04:55:09.020
PS4, so I'll have to plug that in

04:55:09.020 --> 04:55:11.020
again. I, I, I'm kind of like,

04:55:11.020 --> 04:55:13.020
I don't, I kind of don't

04:55:13.020 --> 04:55:15.020
want to, uh, buy

04:55:15.020 --> 04:55:17.020
more games.

04:55:19.020 --> 04:55:21.020
So, yeah, but otherwise,

04:55:21.020 --> 04:55:23.020
yeah, those are some games that I'm

04:55:23.020 --> 04:55:25.020
kind of like, yeah, I kind of want to play those,

04:55:25.020 --> 04:55:27.020
but I'm also

04:55:27.020 --> 04:55:29.020
a little hesitant because it's

04:55:29.020 --> 04:55:31.020
grindy and

04:55:31.020 --> 04:55:33.020
I don't know, sometimes we'll be bored if

04:55:33.020 --> 04:55:35.020
I grind it a lot.

04:55:37.020 --> 04:55:39.020
Any JRPGs you want to play on stream,

04:55:39.020 --> 04:55:41.020
like Dragon Quest? Uh...

04:55:47.020 --> 04:55:49.020
What was the, what was the western RPG

04:55:49.020 --> 04:55:51.020
that I was playing that I was

04:55:51.020 --> 04:55:53.020
saying before? Wild Arms!

04:55:53.020 --> 04:55:55.020
I play Wild Arms.

04:55:57.020 --> 04:55:59.020
And...

04:55:59.020 --> 04:56:01.020
Uh...

04:56:03.020 --> 04:56:05.020
And...

04:56:05.020 --> 04:56:07.020
I don't know, other ones.

04:56:07.020 --> 04:56:09.020
I have to look through my collection again.

04:56:17.020 --> 04:56:19.020
Um...

04:56:19.020 --> 04:56:21.020
Neptunia?

04:56:21.020 --> 04:56:23.020
Oh gosh, Neptunia games suck.

04:56:23.020 --> 04:56:25.020
It's hot

04:56:25.020 --> 04:56:27.020
garbage.

04:56:31.020 --> 04:56:33.020
I look, I look at...

04:56:33.020 --> 04:56:35.020
I go

04:56:35.020 --> 04:56:37.020
to the

04:56:37.020 --> 04:56:39.020
store.

04:56:39.020 --> 04:56:41.020
The, the, the, the

04:56:41.020 --> 04:56:43.020
the worker was

04:56:43.020 --> 04:56:45.020
like...

04:56:45.020 --> 04:56:47.020
was like, oh, Neptunia?

04:56:47.020 --> 04:56:49.020
Are, are these game, I was

04:56:49.020 --> 04:56:51.020
meaning to get into it. Are these games good?

04:56:51.020 --> 04:56:53.020
I go, no, it fucking sucks. Don't even bother.

04:56:53.020 --> 04:56:55.020
Pay them, pay them

04:56:55.020 --> 04:56:57.020
their money and go

04:56:57.020 --> 04:56:59.020
leave with my Neptunia game.

04:56:59.020 --> 04:57:01.020
And they fucky. And I'm just like, I fucking

04:57:01.020 --> 04:57:03.020
hate this game, but it's so cute.

04:57:03.020 --> 04:57:05.020
Dimes are so cute.

04:57:09.020 --> 04:57:11.020
Like, honestly, hot garbage

04:57:11.020 --> 04:57:13.020
shit gameplay, really great

04:57:13.020 --> 04:57:15.020
design, really great characters.

04:57:15.020 --> 04:57:17.020
I'm just like...

04:57:21.020 --> 04:57:23.020
It's garbage.

04:57:23.020 --> 04:57:25.020
Absolutely garbage. Every time,

04:57:25.020 --> 04:57:27.020
every time I, I play another

04:57:27.020 --> 04:57:29.020
Neptunia game, I'm just like, please

04:57:29.020 --> 04:57:31.020
let it be good. And it's not.

04:57:41.020 --> 04:57:43.020
I fucking hate it.

04:57:43.020 --> 04:57:45.020
Fucking hate it.

04:57:51.020 --> 04:57:53.020
I literally was like

04:57:53.020 --> 04:57:55.020
literally the cash register guy

04:57:55.020 --> 04:57:57.020
was like, oh yeah, I've been meaning to get into

04:57:57.020 --> 04:57:59.020
the series. Is it any good? No.

04:58:03.020 --> 04:58:05.020
Leaves.

04:58:09.020 --> 04:58:11.020
But yeah, um,

04:58:11.020 --> 04:58:13.020
I think I'll play Neptunia. I think all I

04:58:13.020 --> 04:58:15.020
would do would be like, I hate

04:58:15.020 --> 04:58:17.020
this.

04:58:17.020 --> 04:58:19.020
All I would say

04:58:19.020 --> 04:58:21.020
is that I would hate this.

04:58:21.020 --> 04:58:23.020
Would you ever play the world end with you

04:58:23.020 --> 04:58:25.020
on your DS Lite?

04:58:25.020 --> 04:58:27.020
Uh, I would, but

04:58:27.020 --> 04:58:29.020
I don't have anything to capture

04:58:29.020 --> 04:58:31.020
DS with. So you'd need

04:58:31.020 --> 04:58:33.020
like, uh, completely new DS

04:58:33.020 --> 04:58:35.020
with a capture system

04:58:35.020 --> 04:58:37.020
on it. And I just don't have that. And the guy

04:58:37.020 --> 04:58:39.020
who used to make them, don't make them anymore.

04:58:39.020 --> 04:58:41.020
So, uh, yeah, we're shit

04:58:41.020 --> 04:58:43.020
out of luck, guys.

04:58:45.020 --> 04:58:47.020
And I am not allowed to do anything else

04:58:47.020 --> 04:58:49.020
other than play on original hardware stuff.

04:58:55.020 --> 04:58:57.020
Any PS2 games

04:58:57.020 --> 04:58:59.020
that you're looking forward to streaming soon?

04:58:59.020 --> 04:59:01.020
Definitely.

04:59:03.020 --> 04:59:05.020
Probably digital

04:59:05.020 --> 04:59:07.020
Devil Saga

04:59:07.020 --> 04:59:09.020
and Devil Summoner. Yeah, those two

04:59:09.020 --> 04:59:11.020
are definitely like my main ones that I'm just like, yeah,

04:59:11.020 --> 04:59:13.020
I'll be great.

04:59:15.020 --> 04:59:17.020
Ah, DS Lite

04:59:17.020 --> 04:59:19.020
Hand Cam Stream. That's not going to

04:59:19.020 --> 04:59:21.020
work out senpai because I

04:59:21.020 --> 04:59:23.020
I can get like button

04:59:23.020 --> 04:59:25.020
mashing and it would just shake all the time.

04:59:25.020 --> 04:59:27.020
So you wouldn't even be able to see

04:59:27.020 --> 04:59:29.020
what is going on, right? And then I

04:59:29.020 --> 04:59:31.020
turn

04:59:31.020 --> 04:59:33.020
the DS and go

04:59:33.020 --> 04:59:35.020
and it's not going to capture, right?

04:59:37.020 --> 04:59:39.020
You know what I mean? Like handheld.

04:59:39.020 --> 04:59:41.020
It's like you're you're supposed to turn

04:59:41.020 --> 04:59:43.020
and go

04:59:43.020 --> 04:59:45.020
go

04:59:51.020 --> 04:59:53.020
You wouldn't happen to know Legend of

04:59:53.020 --> 04:59:55.020
Legia, would you, Mercy?

04:59:55.020 --> 04:59:57.020
Legend of Legia?

04:59:57.020 --> 04:59:59.020
Legend of

04:59:59.020 --> 05:00:01.020
Legia.

05:00:01.020 --> 05:00:03.020
I might have to see it.

05:00:03.020 --> 05:00:05.020
I do not know this game.

05:00:07.020 --> 05:00:09.020
Well, it looks pretty cool.

05:00:09.020 --> 05:00:11.020
I don't even know if I have it though.

05:00:11.020 --> 05:00:13.020
I might have it. I have to look.

05:00:21.020 --> 05:00:23.020
I have to look at it, but

05:00:23.020 --> 05:00:25.020
I definitely want to play with like

05:00:25.020 --> 05:00:27.020
if I could somehow

05:00:31.020 --> 05:00:33.020
Excuse me.

05:00:37.020 --> 05:00:39.020
Too much. Not enough liquid.

05:00:43.020 --> 05:00:45.020
If I could

05:00:49.020 --> 05:00:51.020
If I could

05:00:53.020 --> 05:00:55.020
capture it somehow

05:00:55.020 --> 05:00:57.020
for senpai while still be able

05:00:57.020 --> 05:00:59.020
to use the stylus and everything because

05:00:59.020 --> 05:01:01.020
let me tell you

05:01:01.020 --> 05:01:03.020
it was really hard to play games.

05:01:03.020 --> 05:01:05.020
DS games without

05:01:05.020 --> 05:01:07.020
using the stylus.

05:01:13.020 --> 05:01:15.020
You know, Legend of Legia, my nuts

05:01:15.020 --> 05:01:17.020
asshole

05:01:35.020 --> 05:01:37.020
Anyways

05:01:43.020 --> 05:01:45.020
But yeah, I love using

05:01:45.020 --> 05:01:47.020
the stylus. I'm not going to lie.

05:01:47.020 --> 05:01:49.020
I love using the stylus so

05:01:49.020 --> 05:01:51.020
playing any DS games without

05:01:51.020 --> 05:01:53.020
using the stylus would fucking suck.

05:01:53.020 --> 05:01:55.020
Forget, do you like rhythm games?

05:01:55.020 --> 05:01:57.020
No.

05:01:57.020 --> 05:01:59.020
I suck at rhythm. I have no sense of rhythm.

05:01:59.020 --> 05:02:01.020
Thank you, Jamie, for the

05:02:01.020 --> 05:02:03.020
for the

05:02:03.020 --> 05:02:05.020
most tier, for sending off the most

05:02:05.020 --> 05:02:07.020
tier. Thank you.

05:02:07.020 --> 05:02:09.020
For being a member.

05:02:09.020 --> 05:02:11.020
Most tier and membership is still the same, right?

05:02:11.020 --> 05:02:13.020
Yeah, yeah.

05:02:13.020 --> 05:02:15.020
It should be the same. Thank you for being a member.

05:02:23.020 --> 05:02:25.020
I wonder if you do the Yakuza series. I do have some

05:02:25.020 --> 05:02:27.020
Yakuza games, so

05:02:27.020 --> 05:02:29.020
Maybe

05:02:29.020 --> 05:02:31.020
I had fun, but most of the time

05:02:31.020 --> 05:02:33.020
I know

05:02:33.020 --> 05:02:35.020
I know that

05:02:35.020 --> 05:02:37.020
I'm going to just

05:02:37.020 --> 05:02:39.020
play the claw game over

05:02:39.020 --> 05:02:41.020
and over.

05:02:47.020 --> 05:02:49.020
I'll play the claw game over and over.

05:02:49.020 --> 05:02:51.020
I'll be like, check this out, Senpai.

05:02:51.020 --> 05:02:53.020
Yeah.

05:02:57.020 --> 05:02:59.020
Look at me. I'm

05:02:59.020 --> 05:03:01.020
winning.

05:03:05.020 --> 05:03:07.020
Yeah, winning prizes for Senpai.

05:03:11.020 --> 05:03:13.020
Go to karaoke.

05:03:13.020 --> 05:03:15.020
I suck at karaoke, by the way.

05:03:19.020 --> 05:03:21.020
I suck at the karaoke because it's like

05:03:21.020 --> 05:03:23.020
I'm not familiar

05:03:23.020 --> 05:03:25.020
because I always get confused about which

05:03:25.020 --> 05:03:27.020
controller I'm using. So when it's like

05:03:27.020 --> 05:03:29.020
press the buttons and the rhythm

05:03:29.020 --> 05:03:31.020
and I'm like, oh shit, which buttons which

05:03:35.020 --> 05:03:37.020
Honestly, I went to

05:03:37.020 --> 05:03:39.020
the

05:03:39.020 --> 05:03:41.020
when I was playing Yakuza Zero, I went to the

05:03:43.020 --> 05:03:45.020
the video club a lot.

05:03:53.020 --> 05:03:55.020
The video store a lot.

05:03:57.020 --> 05:03:59.020
I

05:04:05.020 --> 05:04:07.020
Me too for completion rewards, right?

05:04:07.020 --> 05:04:09.020
Yeah, completion rewards.

05:04:23.020 --> 05:04:25.020
Get that a hundred percent.

05:04:27.020 --> 05:04:29.020
Oh

05:04:29.020 --> 05:04:31.020
man, I'm still yapping.

05:04:31.020 --> 05:04:33.020
I'm still yapping.

05:04:45.020 --> 05:04:47.020
I want to play lots of games with Senpai

05:04:47.020 --> 05:04:49.020
and I know it's like

05:04:49.020 --> 05:04:51.020
oh

05:04:51.020 --> 05:04:53.020
I feel bad though

05:04:53.020 --> 05:04:55.020
because

05:04:55.020 --> 05:04:57.020
all I've been playing have been games

05:04:57.020 --> 05:04:59.020
and I've been like

05:04:59.020 --> 05:05:01.020
oh yeah, I want to schedule this game

05:05:01.020 --> 05:05:03.020
and this game and then I'm like

05:05:03.020 --> 05:05:05.020
I should probably schedule in some other

05:05:05.020 --> 05:05:07.020
stuff too.

05:05:09.020 --> 05:05:11.020
Are you planning to do another karaoke stream?

05:05:11.020 --> 05:05:13.020
Yeah.

05:05:13.020 --> 05:05:15.020
I don't know when

05:05:15.020 --> 05:05:17.020
but yeah.

05:05:21.020 --> 05:05:23.020
I've been like, oh my gosh, I want to play this game

05:05:23.020 --> 05:05:25.020
this game and this game and this game

05:05:25.020 --> 05:05:27.020
other stuff, yeah, like ASMR

05:05:27.020 --> 05:05:29.020
maybe like

05:05:29.020 --> 05:05:31.020
I don't know like

05:05:31.020 --> 05:05:33.020
hand cam streams

05:05:33.020 --> 05:05:35.020
uh

05:05:35.020 --> 05:05:37.020
batsu wheel or something like that

05:05:37.020 --> 05:05:39.020
but me I was like a game, game, game, game

05:05:39.020 --> 05:05:41.020
game, game, game, game, game, game, game

05:05:47.020 --> 05:05:49.020
like I was like maybe I should do

05:05:49.020 --> 05:05:51.020
do those things

05:05:51.020 --> 05:05:53.020
and I'm just like

05:05:53.020 --> 05:05:55.020
but this game, I want to play this game

05:05:55.020 --> 05:05:57.020
with Senpai

05:05:57.020 --> 05:05:59.020
Senpai, help me, this part is hard

05:06:05.020 --> 05:06:07.020
speaking of hand cam streams

05:06:07.020 --> 05:06:09.020
how did the alchemy come out?

05:06:09.020 --> 05:06:11.020
It's super cute!

05:06:11.020 --> 05:06:13.020
It's unlike my makeup

05:06:13.020 --> 05:06:15.020
it's not like my makeup

05:06:15.020 --> 05:06:17.020
uh

05:06:17.020 --> 05:06:19.020
container thing

05:06:19.020 --> 05:06:21.020
oh well

05:06:21.020 --> 05:06:23.020
it's on that right now

05:06:29.020 --> 05:06:31.020
so that's why I was like

05:06:31.020 --> 05:06:33.020
uh okay

05:06:35.020 --> 05:06:37.020
honestly I'm just like uh

05:06:37.020 --> 05:06:39.020
hand cam ASMR

05:06:39.020 --> 05:06:41.020
um I'm not sure if I can

05:06:41.020 --> 05:06:43.020
knew that I feel like

05:06:45.020 --> 05:06:47.020
I feel like it's you know

05:06:49.020 --> 05:06:51.020
it's just super awkward

05:06:53.020 --> 05:06:55.020
since I'm very unfamiliar

05:06:55.020 --> 05:06:57.020
with ASMR

05:06:57.020 --> 05:06:59.020
and I'm still learning

05:06:59.020 --> 05:07:01.020
I would be like just me

05:07:01.020 --> 05:07:03.020
just need my hands just go like

05:07:03.020 --> 05:07:05.020
ugh

05:07:05.020 --> 05:07:07.020
shrugging every moment

05:07:11.020 --> 05:07:13.020
like I don't know what I'm doing

05:07:15.020 --> 05:07:17.020
I'm just doing what I think

05:07:17.020 --> 05:07:19.020
would sound nice

05:07:19.020 --> 05:07:21.020
honestly like

05:07:21.020 --> 05:07:23.020
I bought some things and I was like

05:07:23.020 --> 05:07:25.020
um

05:07:25.020 --> 05:07:27.020
I think this would sound nice on a microphone

05:07:27.020 --> 05:07:29.020
on like the 3D

05:07:29.020 --> 05:07:31.020
oh I think it would sound nice

05:07:31.020 --> 05:07:33.020
gives us, gives you a thumbs up

05:07:33.020 --> 05:07:35.020
yeah

05:07:43.020 --> 05:07:45.020
so I feel so awkward

05:07:45.020 --> 05:07:47.020
when I do like ASMR

05:07:47.020 --> 05:07:49.020
I mean like

05:07:49.020 --> 05:07:51.020
I think

05:07:51.020 --> 05:07:53.020
I kind of face palm on myself

05:07:53.020 --> 05:07:55.020
when people are like do ear copying

05:07:55.020 --> 05:07:57.020
and then I was like

05:07:59.020 --> 05:08:01.020
the 3D all ears with your hands

05:08:01.020 --> 05:08:03.020
and I said okay

05:08:03.020 --> 05:08:05.020
and then I had to ask

05:08:05.020 --> 05:08:07.020
10 pies, now what

05:08:07.020 --> 05:08:09.020
ah

05:08:13.020 --> 05:08:15.020
I didn't know what copying was

05:08:21.020 --> 05:08:23.020
like I was researching

05:08:23.020 --> 05:08:25.020
stuff and then I was like

05:08:25.020 --> 05:08:27.020
I don't know everything

05:08:29.020 --> 05:08:31.020
so yeah I feel a little

05:08:31.020 --> 05:08:33.020
embarrassed about that

05:08:33.020 --> 05:08:43.540
But yeah, otherwise it's um, yeah, I think it's fun, it's also fun.

05:08:43.540 --> 05:08:49.580
The giggles were the best part, I think Senpai is making me laugh and then it's really hard

05:08:49.580 --> 05:08:56.820
to not laugh when you're trying to not laugh and then it becomes like it's you laugh harder.

05:08:56.820 --> 05:09:05.020
Oh yeah, just try, try trying to laugh quietly or trying to not laugh and then you end up

05:09:05.020 --> 05:09:13.300
laughing, you know, and then you keep on laughing and you can't stop.

05:09:13.300 --> 05:09:22.220
So yeah, that is the giggle, yeah, the giggle feedback loop, exactly.

05:09:22.220 --> 05:09:30.580
So yeah, oh speaking of Senpai, um, did you see my new ASMR video?

05:09:30.580 --> 05:09:39.100
Kind of, it's kind of like a jokie ASMR video.

05:09:39.100 --> 05:09:40.100
You did?

05:09:40.100 --> 05:09:41.100
You did?

05:09:41.100 --> 05:09:42.100
Yeah.

05:09:42.100 --> 05:09:43.100
Did you know?

05:09:43.100 --> 05:09:44.100
My laughing?

05:09:44.100 --> 05:09:47.380
I didn't stop laughing, it was straight up.

05:09:47.380 --> 05:10:00.340
I laughed for, I couldn't get past, I laughed, I laughed non-stop, that was one take, yeah.

05:10:00.340 --> 05:10:04.340
You know what else is also one take?

05:10:04.340 --> 05:10:08.900
That's surprising?

05:10:08.900 --> 05:10:20.260
My cover song, the like, notice me Senpai cover song was also one take.

05:10:20.260 --> 05:10:21.980
Because I will tell you why.

05:10:21.980 --> 05:10:27.460
People were like, oh, why didn't you do it in parts and I was like, listen, that song

05:10:27.460 --> 05:10:34.420
is kind of bad, I'm not going to lie to you, um, that song is kind of bad, so if I don't

05:10:34.420 --> 05:10:45.300
do it in one take, I'm going to lose the rhythm really fast.

05:10:45.300 --> 05:10:57.660
So I, like, when I tried it in parts, I was like, I cannot, I cannot do this in more than

05:10:57.660 --> 05:11:27.660
one part because it's going to lose, I'm going to just be like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-

05:11:27.660 --> 05:11:50.660
different like that's that's the that's the beat right it's hard it's hard to follow that

05:11:50.660 --> 05:11:53.500
it's hard to follow that so I was like I have to do it in one shot

05:11:53.500 --> 05:12:06.540
hey yo why are you clapping to the beat of the song and pie I saw you at school today took

05:12:06.540 --> 05:12:14.260
your picture then I walked no then I snapped away I want you to notice me but I'm just someone

05:12:14.260 --> 05:12:22.660
you don't notice still I think I've got another rival I have to kill right you see you see where

05:12:22.700 --> 05:12:31.340
I'm just like okay this is not this is having I'm having problems here please notice me some pie

05:12:31.340 --> 05:12:48.700
please notice me some pie right and then I messed up a bunch of times honestly but but

05:12:48.700 --> 05:13:04.500
editors be editing you know luckily like it it's it's hard if when I did the song it was

05:13:04.500 --> 05:13:16.020
some pie I saw you at school today took your picture then I snuck away I want you to notice me

05:13:16.020 --> 05:13:23.060
but you're just someone I'm just someone you don't notice fuck it's really hard it's really hard

05:13:23.060 --> 05:13:30.620
okay so it's it's a song it's definitely a song you cannot sing in parts you should share the

05:13:30.620 --> 05:13:39.420
unedited version someday the unedited version only has one mistake it only has one mistake and

05:13:39.420 --> 05:13:45.300
the mistake is an please notice me one please notice me some pie that was easily edited and

05:13:45.300 --> 05:13:53.260
the only reason why that was a mistake was because I ran out of breath one please notice me some

05:13:53.260 --> 05:14:11.020
pie and it was just like please notice me some pie and that was it breathing breathing

05:14:11.020 --> 05:14:21.940
specs again that cup sounded real about Calif was real I was easily edited out because well I

05:14:21.940 --> 05:14:28.900
say like please notice me some pie like a million times right like so many times just replace one

05:14:28.900 --> 05:14:46.140
it's fine like that was the only mistake I had and I think I lost the beat a little bit towards

05:14:46.140 --> 05:15:01.460
the end cuz I was like okay I hate this song like I originally I actually asked cuz I was like

05:15:01.460 --> 05:15:09.340
I'm supposed to cover this and I know I know it's like a song that people like but I honestly do

05:15:09.340 --> 05:15:18.180
not like the song personally because it just doesn't sound good to me then again I am also not a

05:15:18.180 --> 05:15:24.540
music person and as you all know that I am I don't really listen to music senpai senpai so I don't

05:15:24.540 --> 05:15:32.860
listen to music so I'm kind of insane I'm kind of insane it's probably yeah it's probably just

05:15:32.860 --> 05:15:42.980
something simple like it's not enough melody or something it turned out well man yeah I'm glad it

05:15:42.980 --> 05:15:50.380
turned out well because I was like oh no music at all yeah like when I'm studying or focused I

05:15:50.380 --> 05:16:00.780
don't listen to music like at all the only times I ever listen to music is kind of like if I want

05:16:00.780 --> 05:16:14.220
something atmospheric then it's like a gay molestee or anime song really no song when though I would

05:16:14.220 --> 05:16:25.580
love to I would love to release some of my original songs yeah you listen to Amiens or

05:16:25.580 --> 05:16:31.540
white noise or not listen to things why you work I don't listen to anything at all why I work senpai

05:16:31.540 --> 05:16:40.300
like honestly I do not listen to any music it is silent why I'm working I cannot have anything

05:16:40.540 --> 05:16:53.420
interrupt me why I think like otherwise I get too distracted or it's just I don't like it

05:16:57.740 --> 05:17:03.820
like I just don't like it I just need my moment to to be in my head and just write it

05:17:03.980 --> 05:17:13.580
but like most people will just call me insane and they're right I am definitely not someone

05:17:14.460 --> 05:17:20.380
um that's not normal I know that's not normal so that's why people are like yeah you're kind of

05:17:20.380 --> 05:17:29.100
insane and I'm like yeah you're right you're right that is insane behavior but I don't know it's just

05:17:29.100 --> 05:17:37.660
something I've been like doing most of my life like if I need total silence okay this is

05:17:37.660 --> 05:17:49.660
this is going to be very funny but when I was in college I would sometimes if I wanted total

05:17:49.660 --> 05:18:01.580
deafening silence I would work in the bathroom I would study in the bathroom because it was quiet

05:18:01.580 --> 05:18:08.300
there was nothing yeah it was just like you know the echoing or like whatever like the

05:18:08.300 --> 05:18:12.380
complete silence in the bathroom was just I just studied there

05:18:17.180 --> 05:18:25.260
but the germs it's my germs like at home at home not like in the school bathroom I meant at

05:18:25.260 --> 05:18:33.420
home I would study in the bathroom like in the tub because I could just focus there

05:18:43.740 --> 05:18:52.460
okay if you top has plenty of space and like I would actually bring in a table I would bring

05:18:52.460 --> 05:19:04.700
in a table and then I would just work in silence because it was like away from everything there

05:19:04.700 --> 05:19:13.580
was nothing distracting me I would just I just work and it it was really productive

05:19:14.540 --> 05:19:22.620
it was a tub full full of what it's just me it's just me I'll just sit in there or I'll sit on

05:19:23.580 --> 05:19:30.140
I'll put down the toilet seat like cover and then I would just put the table and just start studying

05:19:34.060 --> 05:19:39.260
not soaking in the water no it's like empty empty you know whatever gets you to pass

05:19:40.220 --> 05:19:45.580
I got pretty good grade senpai so don't worry don't worry senpai I got good grades

05:19:57.580 --> 05:20:04.860
so yeah I would just work in the bathroom and just study and write notes in the bathroom

05:20:04.860 --> 05:20:09.980
because there was nothing distracting me and the bathroom has like white walls so it felt

05:20:09.980 --> 05:20:14.540
kind of sterile too so I was like okay yeah it's just peaceful here I can study here

05:20:17.100 --> 05:20:23.500
because if I'm in my if I'm in my bedroom and I'm just like oh I have so many toys to play with

05:20:24.060 --> 05:20:38.140
how do I get this kind of power like studying power I don't know

05:20:41.100 --> 05:20:50.300
toys yeah like you know my ds is there or the tv is there and and uh look my vita oh my gosh look

05:20:50.300 --> 05:20:51.740
there's new shows ah

05:20:55.820 --> 05:21:05.900
oh my gosh books mangos mangos yeah I can't think when it's too quiet how'd you get the opposite

05:21:12.780 --> 05:21:18.860
honestly using a tv as a toy is crazy really I don't know I feel like technology is like a

05:21:18.940 --> 05:21:29.980
sort of toy for everyone right that's why I call it a toy um

05:21:35.900 --> 05:21:39.180
honestly how I got to study was I guess

05:21:44.060 --> 05:21:45.980
I didn't have anything else to think about

05:21:49.420 --> 05:21:54.220
I I didn't have anything else to think about and deadlines really worried me and I had like

05:21:54.220 --> 05:21:59.740
the crippling anxiety of failure so I was like no I can't do it I had I have to pass

05:22:04.780 --> 05:22:06.940
and I don't know I also had uh

05:22:09.260 --> 05:22:13.740
I had like a genuine interest in the subject as well

05:22:14.060 --> 05:22:23.020
so uh if I I did much better in subjects I had an interest in of course

05:22:27.260 --> 05:22:34.220
and other times I would be like uh no I'm oh I although I did quite well for subjects I

05:22:34.220 --> 05:22:37.420
did had no interest in I still forced myself to be interested

05:22:37.660 --> 05:22:46.940
so yeah uh honestly if anyone has like studying techniques or anything and they ask me I just

05:22:46.940 --> 05:22:57.340
like uh work in the bathroom I don't know I I was I'm weird I'm a little weirdo

05:22:58.060 --> 05:23:08.060
I'm a little weirdo and so yeah I I like honestly I genuinely like studying as well

05:23:17.340 --> 05:23:20.780
so yeah mercy solution is simple don't have ADHD

05:23:22.940 --> 05:23:25.260
yeah only have diet ADHD

05:23:28.300 --> 05:23:33.420
but yeah I'm I'm a little bit strange I'm a little bit loopy I guess

05:23:36.860 --> 05:23:41.100
but yeah I I I can hyper fixate on something real fast

05:23:46.700 --> 05:23:47.340
so yeah

05:23:49.900 --> 05:23:53.820
uh yeah studying tip for me probably really fucking useless

05:23:58.220 --> 05:24:00.220
yeah

05:24:07.180 --> 05:24:12.220
yeah that's why we like you is because I'm a I'm a little weirdo I'm a little freak

05:24:14.700 --> 05:24:15.740
thanks senpai

05:24:19.900 --> 05:24:23.740
I I I appreciate it

05:24:27.820 --> 05:24:29.740
so

05:24:32.700 --> 05:24:33.740
hold on

05:24:38.460 --> 05:24:42.460
I want to see who's on

05:24:45.180 --> 05:24:53.260
felt that I can grade into them I'm I'm I'm winding down senpai I'm winding down

05:24:53.980 --> 05:25:04.220
so I'm feeling I'm feeling like I'm gonna wind down enjoy myself what do I have for my schedule

05:25:04.220 --> 05:25:12.860
tomorrow right I have my collab with strawney tomorrow I I am going to be playing untitled goose

05:25:12.860 --> 05:25:23.100
game and then I have a day off and then we have the uno collab and then another day off so

05:25:23.660 --> 05:25:29.500
uh next week I'm going to probably have a very small schedule as well

05:25:30.460 --> 05:25:37.740
um just so I can I can get like a lot of things done I still have a lot of a lot of chores and

05:25:37.740 --> 05:25:45.180
I need some days to just relax by myself or relax with some friends as well so I

05:25:45.180 --> 05:25:49.580
I need a few more days off to do chores and then also like have some time

05:25:50.300 --> 05:26:00.780
so yeah uh that's my schedule coming up I am probably going to pick up some new games

05:26:00.780 --> 05:26:09.500
next week so that uh we'll have a little bit of variety and then come back to other games

05:26:09.500 --> 05:26:15.340
just so to like finish some games off uh I think I'm still pretty far in killer seven

05:26:16.300 --> 05:26:21.500
like I'm still kind of in the beginning part with killer seven I'm not good at that game so

05:26:21.500 --> 05:26:33.900
that one will probably be spaced apart as well and uh and I know I know I'm gonna pick up some

05:26:33.900 --> 05:26:40.860
games so yeah did we finish harvester I passed out no we're I think I think I'm at the very last

05:26:40.860 --> 05:26:46.620
ending of harvester I think I think we have at least one or two more hours of that game so I

05:26:47.420 --> 05:26:54.620
I am hoping to finish it at least the week after next week yeah I want to finish harvester

05:27:00.780 --> 05:27:03.900
so I'm pretty sure I have like an hour to two hours left

05:27:04.780 --> 05:27:12.700
yeah we can harvest one more stream out of that game and then we close a chapter

05:27:13.500 --> 05:27:18.860
in harvester and we pick up a new game like another new game

05:27:22.380 --> 05:27:27.740
it really depends on like how I feel like some games I'm kind of trying out to just gauge like

05:27:27.740 --> 05:27:30.940
how us tempis like them or not as well

05:27:36.780 --> 05:27:41.740
