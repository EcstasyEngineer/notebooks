71000	75000	when it's not an absolute cluster buck of all six of us together.
75000	80000	But yes, the whole premise of the power washer was I was going to do a gag
80000	83000	and be like, oh, Viola isn't doing so well.
83000	85000	We might go bust.
85000	88000	We might go and put a bikini on and get clean in.

593000	595000	or some joking phrases.
595000	598000	What I'm hearing is that a lot of you guys are misinterpreting
598000	600000	whatever it is that's very funny.
600000	602000	It's going all over his back.
602000	604000	It's not looking good.
608000	610000	How do you draw an angry mouth?
610000	612000	Oh, there we go.
615000	617000	Pits is feet.
617000	619000	No, I'm pretty sure it's armpits.
619000	621000	We need to draw.
621000	623000	Pits is sweat.
623000	624000	This is amazing.

660000	661000	It makes it worse.
661000	662000	It makes it worse.
670000	673000	I thought pits is like pits.
675000	678000	This is so fucking funny.

774760	776760	And then there's Chris Hansen.
776760	777760	Oh my gosh.
777760	780760	And I said, she said it's going to kill me with a crash.
780760	782760	You know, date luck.

806760	808760	Why does it always sound such a fat talk?
808760	810760	There's a pee pee.
810760	812760	Because he loves me and he's big.
812760	814760	They grew up together.

944760	946760	It's a winky face.
946760	948760	Okay it's a winky face.
948760	950760	I was like what is miawa?
950760	952760	So I was like who is this guy?
954760	956760	We are so good.
956760	958760	This is a cat.
960760	962760	That's good.
962760	964760	That's good.
964760	966760	I love that.
970760	972760	Okay this makes sense.
972760	974760	This makes sense of what on earth we were drawing.
974760	976760	Because I just chucked out
976760	978760	and like that's items on the shelves.
978760	980760	I worked around.
982760	984760	Oh this is a good diaper.
986760	988760	I see understood me.
990760	992760	Oh my god.
994760	996760	I snored in my teeth or my nose.
998760	1000760	I snored in my teeth or my nose.
1006760	1008760	It's painful it hurts.
1008760	1010760	I can't.
1010760	1012760	I can't.
1012760	1014760	I had to do the toilet stall gap.
1014760	1016760	Because that's all I see about
1016760	1018760	when I see American memes.
1018760	1020760	Oh the toilet stall.
1020760	1022760	The toilet gap is so big.
1022760	1024760	You can literally look at people's eyes through it.
1024760	1026760	It went the wrong way.
1026760	1028760	Oh no.
1028760	1030760	We have them closed because you know it's a private time
1030760	1032760	and you're very vulnerable taking a big job.
1032760	1034760	So yeah it's actually closed everywhere else in the planet.
1034760	1036760	Oh you're so lucky.
1036760	1038760	Yeah.
1038760	1040760	I had people peeking at me in high school
1040760	1042760	through the stalls and I'm like
1042760	1044760	me too.
1044760	1046760	Oh no.
1046760	1048760	Is there a DC?
1048760	1050760	Is there a check?
1050760	1052760	Is there a DC check?
1052760	1054760	Are you in the lobby?
1054760	1056760	Do you need to reload the lobby?
1056760	1058760	It's gonna do it on its own usually.
1058760	1060760	No I'm gone.
1060760	1062760	The link should be in the discord.
1062760	1064760	Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.
1064760	1066760	They'll see everything.
1066760	1068760	I see all of our naughty photos
1068760	1070760	we just send to each other.
1070760	1072760	It's real.
1072760	1074760	It's mostly memes.
1074760	1076760	It's weird.
1076760	1078760	Any memes?
1078760	1080760	I mean to be fair we did share
1080760	1082760	on that page.
1082760	1084760	We did share some
1084760	1086760	lucky nudes of ours.
1086760	1088760	They've seen my titties.
1088760	1090760	I started roleplaying as the girls
1090760	1092760	with my nudes so I was like
1092760	1094760	this is what Evie would do.
1094760	1096760	This is what Evie would do.
1096760	1098760	Our discord is so chaotic.
1098760	1100760	Okay.
1100760	1102760	Real though.
1102760	1104760	But also I did snort out
1104760	1106760	my tea.
1106760	1108760	It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.
1108760	1110760	Oh no.
1110760	1112760	There's your snort and tea.
1112760	1114760	This is what you hate to talk about.
1114760	1116760	It's a stosterone.
1116760	1118760	It hurts so much.
1118760	1120760	Yeah.
1120760	1122760	I'm getting
1122760	1124760	pain.
1124760	1126760	I push
1126760	1128760	my ears.
1128760	1130760	I'm getting another heart beat
1130760	1132760	right now every time she talks.
1132760	1134760	Oh no.
1134760	1136760	Our nudes are eye-prone nudes.
1136760	1138760	I'm not a man.
1138760	1140760	And my face turned out like that.
1140760	1142760	Oopsie.
1142760	1144760	How does she talk like this?
1144760	1146760	I don't know.
1146760	1148760	Oopsie.
1148760	1150760	I feel like Azera
1150760	1152760	can do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression.
1152760	1154760	Me too.
1154760	1156760	Jennifer Coolidge.
1156760	1158760	Did it.
1158760	1160760	I don't know what Jennifer Coolidge
1160760	1162760	is impression.
1162760	1164760	Wait you don't know Jennifer Coolidge.
1164760	1166760	Jennifer Coolidge.
1166760	1168760	Oh.
1170760	1172760	I'm going to switch back to you.
1172760	1174760	Oh my god.
1174760	1176760	Oh my god.
1176760	1178760	Jennifer Coolidge.
1178760	1180760	Are you kidding me?
1180760	1182760	Are you kidding me?
1182760	1184760	Are you kidding me?
1184760	1186760	Why are we opening our gap for the way
1186760	1188760	you raise your voice?
1188760	1190760	Azura.
1190760	1192760	Azura.
1192760	1194760	Click that link in the general
1194760	1196760	discord to bring me out.
1196760	1198760	Is it not letting you back in?
1198760	1200760	Are you being funny?
1200760	1202760	No.
1202760	1204760	No.
1204760	1206760	Are you kidding me?
1206760	1208760	I don't hear you screaming.
1208760	1210760	Your make cuts out.
1210760	1212760	Azura.
1212760	1214760	So it just goes
1216760	1218760	What's happening?
1218760	1220760	What's happening?
1220760	1222760	It's constantly loading.
1222760	1224760	Did you?
1224760	1226760	No.
1226760	1228760	Can we do another?
1228760	1230760	I'm sorry.
1230760	1232760	Will you guys see the discord if I open it?
1232760	1234760	No.
1234760	1236760	I'm sorry.
1236760	1238760	I should see anything else.
1238760	1240760	I would close the winner capture
1240760	1242760	in the OBS just in case.
1242760	1244760	Yes, you can open it.
1244760	1246760	Are we restarting a new lobby?
1246760	1248760	A new lobby?
1248760	1250760	I think we can still invite to this lobby.
1250760	1252760	A bit of all.
1252760	1254760	Why is there two?
1254760	1256760	Are we going to a different room?
1256760	1258760	I don't know.
1258760	1260760	I only see one of you.
1260760	1262760	No.
1262760	1264760	Wait, there's a new one?
1264760	1266760	No, there's Azura again.
1266760	1268760	We're good.
1268760	1270760	We're Gucci.
1270760	1272760	Okay, which one should we play?
1272760	1274760	Normal.
1274760	1276760	Knock off.
1276760	1278760	Keep yourself focused.
1278760	1280760	Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster.
1280760	1282760	Create animations in a collaborative way.
1282760	1284760	Icebreaker.
1284760	1286760	Play with a sentence.
1286760	1288760	Exquisite co-ops.
1288760	1290760	This character is connected by the top of the drawings.
1290760	1292760	I don't know what that means.
1292760	1294760	Hold on.
1294760	1296760	Complement.
1296760	1298760	Complete the sketch.
1298760	1300760	Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.
1300760	1302760	Masterpiece.
1302760	1304760	Create a piece of art.
1304760	1306760	Play in a single term with no time limit.
1306760	1308760	I feel like story would be funny.
1308760	1310760	Write a narrative using only the previous sentence.
1310760	1312760	Yes, okay.
1312760	1314760	You want to do story?
1314760	1316760	Yeah, let's try story.
1316760	1318760	Start writing.
1318760	1320760	Start.
1320760	1322760	Oh.
1326760	1328760	Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?
1328760	1330760	Just a sentence.
1330760	1332760	Okay, okay.
1336760	1338760	Do you like write the whole story or no?
1338760	1340760	No, you have really limited characters.
1340760	1342760	I don't know it.
1342760	1344760	No.
1344760	1346760	What did you do?
1346760	1348760	There's time.
1348760	1350760	There's time.
1350760	1352760	15 seconds, love.
1352760	1354760	Oh, my God.
1354760	1356760	I wanted to write more.
1356760	1358760	You can only write one sentence.
1358760	1360760	Okay.
1360760	1362760	Done.
1362760	1364760	The end.
1364760	1366760	There's it.
1366760	1368760	Oh.
1368760	1370760	Oh.
1370760	1372760	We are not beating the caca allegations.
1372760	1374760	Oh, my God.
1374760	1376760	What the fuck is happening?
1384760	1386760	Oh, they're going to know this is me spelling it
1386760	1388760	because I didn't use a Z on that.
1392760	1394760	I'm just going to leave it like that.
1394760	1396760	Yep, I'm sending it.
1396760	1398760	I'm not even spell checking.
1398760	1400760	Fuck it.
1400760	1402760	Fuck it.
1402760	1404760	Fuck it.
1404760	1406760	I'm bad at stories.
1406760	1408760	What the fuck?
1416760	1418760	So they...
1418760	1420760	Oh.
1424760	1426760	Oh, the sentence is so small.
1426760	1428760	Like, I want to give a bit more.
1428760	1430760	Me, too.
1430760	1432760	Wait.
1432760	1434760	I think it gets shorter over time.
1434760	1436760	I'm going to be like,
1436760	1438760	I'm going to be like,
1444760	1446760	I'm going to write until, fuck.
1446760	1448760	What?
1450760	1452760	What's that?
1452760	1454760	Okay.
1454760	1456760	Wow.
1456760	1458760	Let's see.
1460760	1462760	Oh, no.
1462760	1464760	Fuck.
1464760	1466760	I'm not a spell neighboring.
1466760	1468760	Oh, fuck.
1468760	1470760	Her name.
1470760	1472760	It's funny because...
1472760	1474760	Yes.
1474760	1476760	Nobody's the snippet.
1476760	1478760	The pen pals.
1478760	1480760	The bleeding hearts and the harem
1480760	1482760	all get to see this unfold.
1482760	1484760	And we're all just vaping like...
1484760	1486760	Oh.
1486760	1488760	Fuck it.
1488760	1490760	Oh, you...
1490760	1492760	Wait, is that the fucking...
1492760	1494760	Soft and warm.
1494760	1496760	Fancy little bowl of fur.
1496760	1498760	Happy kitty.
1498760	1500760	Sleepy kitty.
1500760	1502760	You watch fucking
1502760	1504760	big bang
1504760	1506760	steering.
1506760	1508760	Wait, that's a nice spell.
1518760	1520760	I need more letters.
1520760	1522760	I am...
1522760	1524760	Amazing.
1524760	1526760	Amazing.
1526760	1528760	I'm an amazing writer.
1532760	1534760	That sounds like she me.
1536760	1538760	No.
1542760	1544760	I don't know this lyrics.
1544760	1546760	This...
1546760	1548760	This agency...
1548760	1550760	We can just...
1550760	1552760	This agency...
1554760	1556760	I hate this.
1556760	1558760	They don't give you enough to write.
1558760	1560760	It's like...
1560760	1562760	Fuck off.
1564760	1566760	Okay.
1566760	1568760	Here's how terrible this is going to be.
1568760	1570760	I'll do the auto.
1570760	1572760	This is terrible.
1572760	1574760	How about everybody reads their own story?
1574760	1576760	Yeah, of course.
1576760	1578760	Okay.
1578760	1580760	In a galaxy far, far away
1580760	1582760	there was a goat with big titties.
1582760	1584760	She had so much milkers
1584760	1586760	and started raining milk.
1586760	1588760	Milk.
1588760	1590760	Azara then went on to make
1590760	1592760	an empire be milk daily.
1592760	1594760	It was so successful
1594760	1596760	the neighboring kingdoms became jealous.
1596760	1598760	They also wanted some of the juice.
1602760	1604760	Ew, cooties are not good.
1604760	1606760	You're not good.
1610760	1612760	Oh, boy.
1612760	1614760	Okay, long time ago
1614760	1616760	there was a polar bear princess
1616760	1618760	who was trying to fit into...
1622760	1624760	They're a little bit stronger
1624760	1626760	than any foreign addiction.
1626760	1628760	They couldn't touch it.
1628760	1630760	No, that was from Drake.
1638760	1640760	I didn't know how to finish it.
1640760	1642760	I was like...
1642760	1644760	Ding ding.
1644760	1646760	That was supposed to be the song like ding ding.
1646760	1648760	Ding ding.
1648760	1650760	Ding ding.
1650760	1652760	I was so hard.
1652760	1654760	I'm crying.
1654760	1656760	I'm crying.
1656760	1658760	I'm crying.
1658760	1660760	I'm crying.
1660760	1662760	There was a beach of agency
1662760	1664760	that was lived.
1664760	1666760	They all came in
1666760	1668760	and the children were just that bad.
1668760	1670760	So they danced, the pee-pee dance
1670760	1672760	and told the kids.
1672760	1674760	And then finally,
1674760	1676760	they peed everywhere on the
1676760	1678760	floor, the walls, the bed,
1678760	1680760	the kite.
1682760	1684760	We're all filled with piss everywhere
1684760	1686760	but he loved it.
1686760	1688760	The fact that he was in a piss prompt
1688760	1690760	before AC came out with that
1690760	1692760	literally wasn't used.
1692760	1694760	AC didn't have one.
1694760	1696760	AC didn't have one.
1696760	1698760	Third.
1698760	1700760	Seventh character added.
1700760	1702760	This is so good.
1702760	1704760	Okay.
1704760	1706760	Once upon a time, there were whores.
1706760	1708760	They were the elitists of whores.
1708760	1710760	Wild West.
1710760	1712760	All these really cute cowgirls.
1712760	1714760	Pussycat.
1714760	1716760	So cute.
1716760	1718760	So messy.

4197320	4199320	No idea.
4201320	4203320	I can't tell what those are.
4203320	4205320	What is that?
4205320	4207320	Okay.
4209320	4211320	Okay.

4241320	4243320	That's exactly what I drew, I think.
4247320	4249320	Is this a vine reference?
4249320	4251320	I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
4251320	4253320	Locked in.
4253320	4255320	I locked in.
4255320	4257320	Did I give...
4257320	4259320	Wait, did I give them bodies?
4259320	4261320	I don't think I gave them bodies.
4261320	4263320	I don't even know where they are.
4263320	4265320	I don't know.
4265320	4267320	There's a shot in the dark.
4267320	4269320	Mercy, you know what that is gonna be interpreted as.
4269320	4271320	And will I stop the creative flow?
4271320	4273320	Oh my god.

4363320	4365320	Cute? I don't know.
4365320	4367320	I just drew anything.
4367320	4369320	I don't know.
4371320	4373320	Oh, she's sad.
4373320	4375320	No, my hair.
4375320	4377320	I can't wait to see the end of this.
4377320	4379320	This is going to be...
4379320	4381320	This is a great...
4381320	4383320	This is going to be fucking insane.
4383320	4385320	What's going on in the ceiling?
4385320	4387320	Oh, I need to draw on the ceiling quick.
4387320	4389320	There we go.
4389320	4391320	Oh, I'm so scared of what these look like.
4391320	4393320	Me too.
4393320	4395320	Me too.
4395320	4397320	I can't read.
4399320	4401320	It's the end of the TikTok.
4401320	4403320	Oh, my God.
4403320	4405320	Oh, my God.
4405320	4407320	I think she's beautiful.
4407320	4409320	I was like...
4409320	4411320	Oh, you're not okay.
4411320	4413320	I completely missed the body.
4413320	4415320	Oh, my God.
4415320	4417320	Don't talk to my face.
4417320	4419320	Don't talk to my face.
4419320	4421320	Don't talk to my face.
4421320	4423320	I was going to...
4423320	4425320	I was going to write even being cute.
4427320	4429320	She was on a stick.
4429320	4431320	I'm so dating.
4433320	4435320	I'm so sad.
4435320	4437320	I'm so sorry.
4439320	4441320	Oh, that's why you were home in Indiana Jones.
4441320	4443320	I was like, where did that come from?
4445320	4447320	I was trying to write Cowboy,
4447320	4449320	but I didn't.
4449320	4451320	Oh, that's so adorable.
4451320	4453320	I got so mad.
4453320	4455320	Oh, I'm so sorry.
4455320	4457320	You're talking to me.
4457320	4459320	I'm sorry.
4459320	4461320	Wait, why is he crying?
4461320	4463320	Your eye is gone.
4463320	4465320	It's gone white.
4465320	4467320	It's gone purple.
4467320	4469320	I love colors.
4469320	4471320	It really was cooked.
4471320	4473320	I love colors.
4473320	4475320	I used the color black
4475320	4477320	and I used red as well
4477320	4479320	and orange.
4479320	4481320	What is going on with him?
4481320	4483320	That's so rude.
4483320	4485320	He's loving.
4485320	4487320	He's loving.
4487320	4489320	He's so dead.
4489320	4491320	I can't breathe.
4491320	4493320	This was beautiful.
4493320	4495320	Hey.
4495320	4497320	I like this girl.
4497320	4499320	Oh.
4499320	4501320	He's like,
4501320	4503320	what is going on?
4503320	4505320	I don't know.
4505320	4507320	I don't know.
4507320	4509320	You're so fucking eraser.
4509320	4511320	That's why you're so cute.
4511320	4513320	You're so cute.
4513320	4515320	You're so cute.
4515320	4517320	How did we get back to boobs?
4517320	4519320	I don't know how you ran into that.
4519320	4521320	Obviously.
4523320	4525320	Well, actually, that potato was really bad.
4525320	4527320	Never mind.
4527320	4529320	Aw.
4529320	4531320	Awesome.
4531320	4533320	You'll learn number one.
4533320	4535320	Wait, I don't know.
4535320	4537320	You'll learn number three.
4537320	4539320	You're so cute.
4539320	4541320	You're so cute.
4541320	4543320	I'm so sorry.
4543320	4545320	I'm so sorry.
4545320	4547320	I'm so sorry.
4547320	4549320	I'm sorry.
4549320	4551320	I'm so sorry.
4551320	4553320	Stop.
4553320	4555320	Oh no.
4555320	4557320	Look at his soul.
4557320	4559320	What's happening in the middle of the world?
4559320	4561320	Oh my god.
4561320	4563320	Oh my god.
4563320	4565320	The book got you this.
4565320	4567320	Oh, they drew us?
4567320	4569320	Yes.
4569320	4571320	Your mom called me.
4571320	4573320	No!
4573320	4575320	No!
4575320	4577320	No!
4577320	4579320	No!
4579320	4581320	No!
4589320	4591320	Oh no!
4591320	4593320	What are you doing?
4593320	4595320	Oh no!
4595320	4597320	Oh my god!
4597320	4599320	What keeps her from smiling?
4599320	4601320	Same.
4601320	4603320	My jaw hurt.
4603320	4605320	Okay, okay.
4615320	4617320	Oh no!
4617320	4619320	Okay!
4621320	4623320	Oh my god!
4623320	4625320	Oh my god!
4625320	4627320	Oh my god!
4627320	4629320	Oh my god!
4629320	4631320	Can somebody download that one?
4631320	4633320	Oh my god!
4633320	4635320	Oh my god!
4635320	4637320	That's so amazing!
4637320	4639320	That's so fucking funny!
4639320	4641320	I love it!
4641320	4643320	That's so fucking funny!
4643320	4645320	That's so fucking funny!
4645320	4647320	That's so fucking funny!
4647320	4649320	I love it!
4649320	4651320	They got the premium pass!
4651320	4653320	They got the premium pass!
4653320	4655320	You see at the convention.
4655320	4657320	They got the premium pass.
4657320	4659320	That's funny!
4663320	4665320	I'm tying Amy to the tracks.
4665320	4667320	Oh my god!
4667320	4669320	Holy shit!
4669320	4671320	I'm not going to endure the girls to anything more.
4671320	4673320	Because our faces are ready to fall off after that.
4673320	4675320	Is anyone doing a stream?
4675320	4677320	Is anyone doing a stream?
4677320	4679320	Is anyone putting?
4679320	4681320	Are you doing a stream right away, Isnora?
4681320	4683320	Because I'll do something.
4683320	4685320	I need to appear really bad.
4685320	4687320	I'm going to jump out of the call.
4687320	4689320	Of course, you need to pee.
4689320	4691320	I'm going to jump out of the call.
4691320	4693320	I'm asking my new piss out!
4693320	4695320	I know!
4695320	4697320	I'm going to jump out of the call
4697320	4699320	and do a little zart so then I'll redirect into you, Isnora.
4699320	4701320	I'm going to jump out of the call and do a little zart so then I'll redirect into you, Isnora.
4701320	4703320	Okay?
4703320	4705320	I'm going to be on start though.
4705320	4707320	Okay, right.
4707320	4709320	I might play, do you guys want me to?
4709320	4711320	I might play some Call of the Lamb.
4711320	4713320	If someone does a pop-up stream just tell me.
4713320	4715320	I'll talk to my refunds for a bit.
4715320	4717320	Thank you so so much all members and dolls
4717320	4719320	for this hilarity that ensued
4719320	4721320	after such a miserable start.
4721320	4723320	That's amazing.
4723320	4725320	Such a miserable start to power water.
4725320	4727320	I always shat myself from laughing so hard.
4727320	4729320	Oh my god.
4729320	4731320	We already know AC's panties are soaked.
4731320	4733320	So let's not...
4733320	4735320	Am I probably?
4735320	4737320	No!
4737320	4739320	No.
4739320	4741320	Alright, let me sniff.
4741320	4743320	Let me sniff test.
4743320	4745320	No! Don't do the sniff test!
4745320	4747320	Rather pungent my dear.
4747320	4749320	You have to take a test.
4749320	4751320	Taste instead.
4751320	4753320	She just disintegrated.
4753320	4755320	Oh my god.
4755320	4757320	Great.
4757320	4759320	I'm going to jump out of chat.
4759320	4761320	Thank you so much.
4761320	4763320	I'll see you guys next week with each other.
4763320	4765320	So look out for that.
4765320	4767320	I'll jump out of chat.
4767320	4769320	Thank you so much my darlings, my daughters, my girls.
4769320	4771320	I'll talk to you very shortly.
4771320	4773320	I'm off to the refunds.
4773320	4775320	I love you my daughters.
4785320	4787320	These are the Villalor girls.
4787320	4789320	Yeah.
4789320	4791320	They're so cute, right?
4791320	4793320	Oh my god.
4793320	4795320	That was really something.
4795320	4797320	Okay, wait.
4797320	4799320	Are you guys still streaming?
4799320	4801320	Yeah.
4801320	4803320	I am.
4803320	4805320	I don't know what to do.
4805320	4807320	I guess I got to go off.
4807320	4809320	Okay, let's go off.
4809320	4811320	Go to just chatting and then raid into Azra.
4811320	4813320	I think Azra's next, right?
4813320	4815320	Yeah.
4815320	4817320	Me and Azra are going to be streaming.
4817320	4819320	She's doing Stardew.
4819320	4821320	I'm doing Call of the Limb.
4821320	4823320	Wait, wait.
4823320	4825320	So Shibi and Azra are going to stream right now?
4825320	4827320	Yeah, I'm going to keep streaming.
4827320	4829320	No.
4829320	4831320	I'm probably going to end this one
4831320	4833320	so that the bot is separated.
4833320	4835320	Oh, yeah.
4835320	4837320	I ended it to make a new one.
4837320	4839320	Okay.
4839320	4841320	I'll hang up and then I'll go to the
4841320	4843320	just chatting and then I'll send.
4843320	4845320	I'll check if y'all ready.
4845320	4847320	Okay.
4847320	4849320	Bye-bye.
4849320	4851320	Okay.
4851320	4853320	Bye-bye.
4861320	4863320	Okay.
4863320	4865320	I don't know why my chat isn't working.
4865320	4867320	I've double triple-checked it.
4867320	4869320	I'm so sorry.
4869320	4871320	My darling.
4871320	4873320	Snippets.
4873320	4875320	My senpai.
4877320	4879320	That we were going to play,
4879320	4881320	as you know, we were going to play
4881320	4883320	Power Wash Simulator
4883320	4885320	except
4885320	4887320	isn't, because you had to redo the room.
4889320	4891320	You're probably right.
4891320	4893320	You're probably right.
4893320	4895320	Yeah, you're probably right.
4899320	4901320	And what happened with
4901320	4903320	Power Wash Simulator
4903320	4905320	is that every time
4905320	4907320	it got past four people
4907320	4909320	it just disconnected
4909320	4911320	and would not connect
4911320	4913320	everyone in, even though we were in a room
4913320	4915320	for six players.
4915320	4917320	And then that was
4919320	4921320	and then we couldn't
4921320	4923320	we tried. We tried over and over
4923320	4925320	and over and over again and we're like
4925320	4927320	stop, stop moving, stop moving.
4927320	4929320	Maybe they'll come in if we stop moving
4929320	4931320	and it didn't work. And so instead
4931320	4933320	we
4933320	4935320	we ended up having
4935320	4937320	to pick something
4937320	4939320	really fast. So we went through
4939320	4941320	a list of games. We're like
4941320	4943320	do you have this? No. Do you have this? No.
4943320	4945320	Do you have this? No. Oh shit.
4945320	4947320	How about we do Jackbox? Oh shit. How do you stream
4947320	4949320	Jackbox? We don't know how to stream Jackbox.
4949320	4951320	All of us can't stream
4951320	4953320	Jackbox. What do we have instead? Oh,
4953320	4955320	we have Gartik Phone. That's free.
4955320	4957320	And so we stayed
4957320	4959320	with Gartik Phone instead.
4959320	4961320	So I apologize
4961320	4963320	for the fact that we did not do
4963320	4965320	PowerWash Simulator
4965320	4967320	because it was like
4971320	4973320	if I knew everyone was going to go
4973320	4975320	like balls to the walls
4975320	4977320	like
4977320	4979320	yeah, I wouldn't have
4979320	4981320	tried to save the stream.
4981320	4983320	I didn't have to try to save it
4983320	4985320	but I ended up
4985320	4987320	as far as a train
4987320	4989320	wreck. It's far from the moon.
4989320	4991320	This ball is going to go away.
4991320	4993320	Probably.
4993320	4995320	I'll see if it stays up but it might go away.
4997320	4999320	I never stood a chance.
4999320	5001320	I never stood a chance. I was like
5001320	5003320	oh man.
5005320	5007320	It's okay. Can you
5007320	5009320	see how
5009320	5011320	how like
5011320	5013320	gosh, we're so friendly with each
5013320	5015320	other. It's so funny.
5015320	5017320	It's so funny.
5019320	5021320	I'm sorry. Also earlier
5021320	5023320	when you heard like the weird sounds, I'm so
5023320	5025320	sorry. I literally laughed so hard.
5025320	5027320	I
5027320	5029320	the my T went out my nose.
5031320	5033320	Everyone's so cute together. I know
5033320	5035320	they're so cute, right?
5037320	5039320	I love them so much.
5043320	5045320	I love them so much.
5045320	5047320	Honestly, we
5047320	5049320	we're very
5049320	5051320	we're very
5051320	5053320	off the walls with each other.
5055320	5057320	We're off the walls to each other.
5057320	5059320	My stomach hurts
5059320	5061320	so badly.
5061320	5063320	The side of my ears
5063320	5065320	are hurting from my headphones
5065320	5067320	from laughing so hard.
5067320	5069320	Very wholesome.
5069320	5071320	I missed the
5071320	5073320	tear of the day. I think it's green tea.
5073320	5075320	I think it's just a regular green tea.
5079320	5081320	It really
5081320	5083320	unfortunately
5085320	5087320	my arm
5087320	5089320	is still really, really, really bad.
5091320	5093320	It's less bad than before, but now
5093320	5095320	it's all like bumpy and gross.
5095320	5097320	So
5097320	5099320	I'm gonna go rest again in order
5099320	5101320	for it to calm down. I sent
5101320	5103320	pictures to the girls and they were like,
5103320	5105320	oh geez, are you gonna be okay for
5105320	5107320	today's stream? And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it'll be fine.
5111320	5113320	Someone said you were snorting matcha. I mean, like
5113320	5115320	it's probably green tea. So yeah,
5115320	5117320	what is green tea? It's matcha.
5119320	5121320	Was an allergic reaction? I think it's an
5121320	5123320	allergic reaction.
5125320	5127320	I think it's an allergic
5127320	5129320	reaction.
5129320	5131320	But it's like, I felt it last night.
5131320	5133320	It crawled.
5133320	5135320	Like the rash went all the way to my back
5135320	5137320	and I was like,
5137320	5139320	what's going on?
5139320	5141320	So I changed shirts and everything. I changed
5141320	5143320	shirts.
5143320	5145320	I changed shirts.
5145320	5147320	I'm gonna see if by
5147320	5149320	Saturday,
5149320	5151320	if by Saturday, if it doesn't go away,
5151320	5153320	I'm gonna go to the doctor because
5153320	5155320	it is like
5155320	5157320	more than half
5157320	5159320	down now. It's like,
5159320	5161320	it's no long, it's still red
5161320	5163320	ish. It's pink. It's more pink than red
5163320	5165320	and less bumpy.
5169320	5171320	So it should
5171320	5173320	be fine.
5173320	5175320	It should be fine. I'm looking at my arm right now.
5177320	5179320	You should invest in EpiPen for sure though.
5179320	5181320	I was gonna drink
5181320	5183320	some Benadryl, but Benadryl makes me really
5183320	5185320	sleepy and I didn't want to take it before
5185320	5187320	the stream.
5187320	5189320	It's improving.
5189320	5191320	I put some Vaseline on it
5191320	5193320	to soothe it, to soothe it.
5195320	5197320	Have you tried taking
5197320	5199320	Benadryl while showering?
5199320	5201320	Is that supposed to be like some kind of
5201320	5203320	innuendo thing?
5209320	5211320	Are you gonna take it now? Yeah, after stream,
5211320	5213320	right now.
5215320	5217320	I know that Benadryl
5221320	5223320	is supposed to be
5227320	5229320	what do you call it?
5229320	5231320	It's supposed to make people sleepy and in Japan
5231320	5233320	it's marketed as a sleeping
5237320	5239320	aid, but
5241320	5243320	a lot of my friends
5243320	5245320	don't feel the sleepy effect from it.
5245320	5247320	They're like, oh.
5249320	5251320	They're like, oh, it's
5253320	5255320	it makes me actually quite awake
5255320	5257320	and I was like, damn, now
5257320	5259320	it makes me sleepy. So I'm gonna drink
5259320	5261320	some, I'm gonna take some
5261320	5263320	and then we're gonna see if this rash goes down
5263320	5265320	so we can
5265320	5267320	maybe have a good time.
5267320	5269320	Tomorrow, I believe, is Harvester.
5269320	5271320	Let's go over my schedule again.
5271320	5273320	Where's my schedule?
5273320	5275320	There it is.
5277320	5279320	Tomorrow is
5281320	5283320	Harvester
5283320	5285320	part two.
5285320	5287320	So we'll have a lot of
5289320	5291320	fun with that.
5295320	5297320	Um
5297320	5299320	and then
5299320	5301320	after after that Saturday
5301320	5303320	is my day off and then Sunday
5303320	5305320	we're back at it with an unarchived
5307320	5309320	karaoke stream.
5309320	5311320	So we'll be singing
5311320	5313320	some songs.
5313320	5315320	We'll be
5315320	5317320	humming some haas.
5321320	5323320	Yeah, so
5323320	5325320	that's it.
5325320	5327320	Remember, this is
5327320	5329320	since I woke up early for the club
5329320	5331320	Harvester
5331320	5333320	and the unarchived
5333320	5335320	karaoke stream will be at
5335320	5337320	my regular times at 11pm
5337320	5339320	EDT.
5341320	5343320	So we're gonna
5343320	5345320	we're gonna have a good time.
5345320	5347320	Hopefully I'm really looking forward
5347320	5349320	to Harvester. Maybe we'll finish it. Who knows.
5349320	5351320	If there's multiple endings
5351320	5353320	I might try all of them.
5353320	5355320	Who knows.
5355320	5357320	Or I might keep one ending.
5357320	5359320	That might be the case.
5361320	5363320	But yeah, I'm looking forward to
5363320	5365320	the rest of the week and then the following week
5365320	5367320	when the following week will be
5367320	5369320	much less streams
5369320	5371320	and I probably need that dang rest.
5371320	5373320	I need that dang rest.
5375320	5377320	So thank you
5377320	5379320	for the stream. I hope
5379320	5381320	this was okay for some
5381320	5383320	EU, EU bros.
5383320	5385320	I'm sorry that a lot of people can't catch my streams.
5387320	5389320	You know how far through
5389320	5391320	you got last time? No idea.
5391320	5393320	No idea. We're on our third
5393320	5395320	third thingy.
5397320	5399320	So I'm probably gonna take a rest next week
5399320	5401320	and then recharge myself
5401320	5403320	again and slowly
5403320	5405320	put my streams back to
5405320	5407320	five streams a week.
5407320	5409320	So
5409320	5411320	let's get my thingy
5411320	5413320	out. My stream thingy
5413320	5415320	out. Where's my room?
5415320	5417320	Where's my room? Room?
5417320	5419320	My live room!
5423320	5425320	My live room and then
5425320	5427320	we'll raid into
5427320	5429320	one of the girls
5433320	5435320	in one of the
5435320	5437320	third.
5437320	5439320	So let's see.
5439320	5441320	I'll send you guys
5441320	5443320	into Azura
5443320	5445320	Azura Dulays
5447320	5449320	stream
5449320	5451320	because I think she's starting
5453320	5455320	starting Stardew Valley.
5455320	5457320	Yeah.
5457320	5459320	Unless she sings for like
5459320	5461320	hours again then yeah.
5461320	5463320	I'm gonna go back to sleep.
5463320	5465320	I'm gonna
5465320	5467320	maybe put an ice pack on my
5467320	5469320	hives rash again.
5469320	5471320	So thank you so much everyone
5471320	5473320	for today. I know it's chaotic
5473320	5475320	and I'm very sorry
5475320	5477320	that you waited a long time
5477320	5479320	due to technical difficulties
5479320	5481320	but I'm hoping to see you all
5481320	5483320	tomorrow or another time very soon.
5483320	5485320	Okay.
5485320	5487320	And that's, let's go!
5487320	5489320	Scream for Mercy!
5493320	5495320	Thanks for watching!
