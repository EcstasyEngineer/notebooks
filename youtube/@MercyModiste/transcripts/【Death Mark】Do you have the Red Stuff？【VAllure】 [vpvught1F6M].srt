1
00:07:30,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Call Hiyoooo Allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

2
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,520
too much to the right? Should I move over? I feel like I should move over.

3
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Nah, maybe I'll walk too much up the screen.

4
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
I'll make myself bigger.

5
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
I'll make myself bigger. Why do I have two of these open?

6
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
One of these has to go.

7
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,640
One of these things is not like the other.

8
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,760
One of these things made me lose tracking.

9
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,680
Wow, I had everything so ready some pie and now I'm being a klutz.

10
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,680
It's like you can still hear my voice.

11
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,160
Okay, anyways, whoa, whoa, whoa, welcome senpai. Welcome to the screen. Welcome to Deathmark again.

12
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,000
I have good news. My rash has gone so much down, got down so much.

13
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,320
Yesterday I was like, it looks like my arm again and not some and not like him.

14
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,600
Let me grab my controller. I'm so not ready for this.

15
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,600
What happened and how? I don't know. I literally, I think it was my bed sheets.

16
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,920
I put them in the wash and then I put them back onto my bed and then like overnight it got like X,

17
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,160
like super better. I was like, thank you.

18
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,520
But I'm so happy. Oh, and thank you Griffith for the 10 members. I hope everyone enjoys the memberships.

19
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,760
Evil bed sheets, right? How long did you have those bed sheets?

20
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,320
Oh, five, half a year now.

21
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
Did stress play a role in your rash? Probably, 100% probably.

22
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,240
Like it's, I don't know, maybe, maybe I like went to bed with, I don't know, something or maybe

23
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,000
mama, mama or papa was cleaning up in there and they had like, I don't know, stuff on them.

24
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,200
Who knows? How often do you wash them? Washing? What does that mean?

25
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
I don't know.

26
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Forget about it. Forget about it. You don't need to wash shades?

27
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,880
I learned my lesson. No worry. Let me move over here a little bit. Yeah, we go.

28
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:32,720
Oh, but like those are actually new bed sheets. I don't know what happened, but they were new and I've been like using them for

29
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:42,560
um, like maybe, maybe a few months, like half a year now and nothing happened. And then suddenly I was just like, oh, I'm allergic.

30
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:57,120
And then, oh, so today I walked around the, I walked around the neighborhood and then I had, I had a thought, the, does, does

31
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,520
senpai's play ping pong because I'm palm?

32
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Question, is that the reason?

33
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
It is now.

34
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,760
I withhold my answer. Oh, senpai's naughty.

35
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,800
Kohai, what did you have for dinner today? I had a ham and cheese sandwich.

36
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
This morning I had pho.

37
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:54,960
I didn't see anything. You didn't play anything at all. Oh, yeah, not anything at all. Not that I see the paddles everywhere or the nets hidden under one of your beds.

38
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:04,240
I know everything I see. Oh, this, my, this bang hides my third eye. That hides the Gigan eye.

39
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:22,160
What bed? The doggie bed! The doggie bed in the haze!

40
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,920
You get doggie beds. I put a little stuffed animal in there. It's a little pillow.

41
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:54,000
Excuse me. It's starting to get really cold, so I'm being affected by the weather.

42
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,240
But um, as a warning though, my arm still heats up even though the rash is like pretty much like really,

43
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
it's still like 40% still there. Tea check?

44
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,200
Today's tea is pomegranate green tea. I wanted to stay awake for senpai's.

45
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
We would never lie to our precious Kohai.

46
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Says a liar.

47
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:38,160
Word of the day, um, contingency. Like a plan. Like, what you,

48
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:48,080
what senpai's need? A contingency plan.

49
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,480
Okay, let's talk to the people.

50
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,040
Also, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about yesterday. I put the days wrong.

51
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,600
Do you know what mama and papa always say to me?

52
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:39,280
They always go, merci! You're so clumsy. Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.

53
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
Mama, mama always gets mad at me.

54
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,080
Because when I have a button-up shirt or like a cardigan, I always miss one button. So the,

55
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,880
so it's like, the buttons are always wrong.

56
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:14,080
So I was like, oh, so when I told them like, yeah, I made the days wrong. So I have to go down and

57
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:22,160
tell, tell everyone that, that it's the wrong day. They're like, of course, of course you did.

58
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:33,440
I spent the day looking for a matching alchemy model, kid. Oh,

59
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,720
is the senpai's want to have a matching alchemy model?

60
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,600
Yeah, it's, it's, it's a really, it's really fast. I built it in like,

61
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,000
maybe 10 minutes, maybe less than that, five minutes. I suffered the one time where I made a

62
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,720
mistake and then I had to poke, poke one in the mouth again because I forgot to put the strawberry in.

63
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,000
But I really like alchemy. It was like my first, when I was playing Pokemon

64
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,120
Sword and Shield. Oh, which one do I have? I think I have Shield. Yeah. Um,

65
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,680
oh, when I have Sword and, Sword and Shield, it was the first Gigantamax Pokemon I got.

66
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,280
So I was like, yeah.

67
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,320
What's your favorite alchemy variation? The original one, because that's the one I got.

68
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:38,960
My alchemy is named Milfyu after the Galaxy Angel character. If you know Galaxy Angel.

69
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:49,600
The key to the spirit's grudge. It should be within each elementary. Oh, sorry, I was supposed to do voices.

70
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,920
It should be within each elementary. Fate has tied him to that school. However, even I do not

71
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,080
know what form it will take.

72
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,160
My favorite Pokemon is Mimikyu.

73
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,080
Mimikyu is a, is a dangerous Pokemon. I really liked Galaxy Angel because it was the first

74
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,680
DVD I ever had for like an anime series.

75
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:43,280
Hey, wait, Mashita appears as we're getting ready to leave. Bad news.

76
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:58,560
Oh, my favorite Pokemon used to be Vaporeon until, until the copy pasta. And then I, I had a less

77
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,880
respect. I had a less liking to Vaporeon.

78
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:18,400
But I, I can tell you mama and papa's favorite Pokemon, mama's favorite Pokemon is a Lapras.

79
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,120
Which I, I don't know about you senpai, but I feel like Lapras is a very mommy Pokemon.

80
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,920
So when she chose that, I was like, oh, somehow this is so, this is very suitable for you,

81
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:43,040
mommy. And papa and my sister's favorite is Snorlax.

82
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,040
But yeah, when mama, mama picked Lapras, I was like,

83
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,840
ah, this is, this is like a very, this is very suitable for mama.

84
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,320
But like, they also really like Pikachu. I think that's the only one they actually know the name of.

85
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:26,880
It's the only one they actually know the name of. But like, if I gave them like a picture of like

86
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,600
Pokemons, mama picked out Lapras and she was like, yeah, this one's my favorite.

87
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,240
And papa picked out Snorlax and my sister also was like, I like Snorlax.

88
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,720
Imagine if papa chose Vaporeon.

89
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,320
Even if he did, I would not tell senpais. I would not tell senpais, but he did it.

90
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,360
That high school girl. It's Molly, it's gone.

91
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,800
Damn.

92
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,960
At least she's nowhere in the mansion.

93
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,080
Speaking of which, I didn't see her when we were talking to Mary in the hall either.

94
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Maybe she ran away. That doesn't make sense.

95
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,280
What would she accomplish by doing that?

96
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,080
Running away from the mansion won't make her mark disappear.

97
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,960
It could be her form of escape. Many kill themselves if they know they're gonna die.

98
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,400
Okay, okay, Mr. Detective Guy.

99
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:58,160
I maybe something happened to her like the spirit's curse.

100
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,720
Molly saw Hannah Hickel in the mirror at the school. So she's the mark bearer with the strongest

101
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:15,520
connection. It's possible that he zeroed in on her just like Tsukasa said. But there's nothing we can do.

102
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,520
Let's get ready to go. Yeah, we really can't do anything right now.

103
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,080
Even if something happened to Molly, if we can get the mark to vanish, I should save her too.

104
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,040
Let's head out. We're going back to H Elementary.

105
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,520
Let's go back, senpai. Back to the beginning. Does anyone get that reference? Come on.

106
00:22:48,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Yeah, yeah, this is your mom movie. You come back to H Elementary.

107
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,720
Senpais are so smart. I'm so proud of Senpai.

108
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,720
I knew for a while that in the end this place is just a school.

109
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,800
Well, an abandoned school with a monster in it. And you know, the security card probably just died.

110
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,440
Oh yeah, and there's like killer plants in there. Oh, and a bunch of poisonous snakes. So not exactly normal.

111
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,760
Let's go. Tsukasa nods silently and steps forward.

112
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,280
Wait, did I go with the kid?

113
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,320
Oh yeah, I went with the kid because I was like, oh well, adults, they'll fucking die, right?

114
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,280
Okay, let's go in.

115
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,120
Okay, let's see. Examine.

116
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,280
Anything new? What's in the shoe locker? The battered shoe rack is covered in dirt.

117
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,360
Okay, disintegrated stuff. Okay, okay. I want to go to the left this time.

118
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:36,480
We saw it earlier, but look at all these flowers. Roses are red, violets are blue.

119
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:48,960
We saw it. The hallway has completely transformed. Seeing them like this.

120
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,160
Are roses on that pretty? When you look close, they're scary.

121
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,840
Huh? Uh-huh. What's that?

122
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
Tsukasa suddenly speaks up. There.

123
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,600
By the window. Hey, over there, something's sparkling.

124
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,440
The window? I see her rose vines. I may as well check it out though.

125
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,640
Oh, there it is. Something's glinting over by the window.

126
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,920
Looks like something's buried in the rose vines. It's definitely something there.

127
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,280
Sorry, I'm coughing.

128
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,320
I didn't notice it before. No, maybe it wasn't there yet when we passed through here earlier.

129
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,360
A guard from before. Did he drop that? Maybe. He might have fallen on the floor and been

130
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,760
lifted up by the vines. It's only now that it's high enough to be spotted.

131
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,400
If it belonged to the guard, then it could come in handy while we're investigating.

132
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,040
He's in charge of watching this building after all. Let's check it out.

133
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,400
Feel it. Oh, what if I cut myself though? I pushed my fingers into the vines. Ow!

134
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,120
I was careful, but oddly shaped thorns still cut my skin.

135
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,680
Damn, this is a pain. I keep fighting with the vines. I finally reached the metal object.

136
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:32,000
Got school curing! Yeah, make sure to hydrate. Okay. It is a little cold here, Senpai.

137
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:44,880
So, I might, I might be coughing because it's cold. It's been raining a lot.

138
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,520
Yep, just as we thought. These definitely belong to the guards.

139
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,600
These would be extremely useful. You can get into places we...

140
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
The castle suddenly cuts off mid-sentence. What's wrong?

141
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,680
Nothing. I just forgot what I was saying. Anyway, let's keep looking around.

142
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,360
Need info was added to spirit file. Continued investigation of the school.

143
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Huh.

144
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,720
Maybe... I know that the kid doesn't like an adult, but I feel so uncomfortable bringing your kid around.

145
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,480
You know? I feel so uncomfortable bringing a tiny tot.

146
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,920
A tiny tot around with me. Maybe I should go back and grab the guy?

147
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
I'm gonna go back and grab the guy.

148
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:55,360
Maybe he should stay with the creepy doll girl.

149
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
I don't know. I'm just like...

150
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,040
Also, you know, kids are very... I don't know. I feel like the detective might have a gun,

151
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,800
and that might come in handy. But also... Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna go back.

152
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm gonna go back.

153
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,320
Don't fucking do that. Don't fucking do that, gay. I hate kids.

154
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,680
I mean, kid's laughter. Stranny!

155
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,480
Eyeball. Let's take...

156
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,920
Stranny raid! Welcome, Stranny! Welcome to the stream! Welcome raiders! How was...

157
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,720
the hat game... link... the hat game? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

158
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,040
I was watching a bit of it, and I was like, oh, it's so cute!

159
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,840
Turns out, I'm MLG on Zelda and did the boss first time. Nice!

160
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,760
Well, welcome, everyone. Today, I am playing Deathmark.

161
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,800
It's a visual novel, horror-ish game with quick time events and

162
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,200
choices and some movements. So, if you like this,

163
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,280
let's play.

164
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,840
Okay, now we'll return to HLM entry, because I'm just like, I don't know! I don't like bringing a kid

165
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:51,440
with me! There you go. Spooky spooky. Okay, all in favor to go left? I'm going left.

166
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:05,680
Okay, I use the school key ring and open the door. Yeah! Son of a bitch!

167
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:34,640
This is why we're like, I don't like kids, generally.

168
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,640
Did that get a senpai's? Child jumpscare.

169
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,520
Did that get senpai's too? Because my heart dropped for a second.

170
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,160
Okay, let's, uh, look.

171
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,040
The aluminum chalk case has dents all over it, as if something hit it.

172
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
Eel. Something's inside the chalk case.

173
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,280
Found a worn-out talisman, and I pick up the worn-out talisman. I feel warmth flow through me!

174
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:30,160
My heart died for a moment. I got used to it. I was like, ah, I forgot the jump scares.

175
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,000
Got soap power. Yeah, the worn-out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

176
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,200
Let's check out this really dirty aquarium.

177
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Look, and glass is terribly stained, making it impossible to see inside.

178
00:31:52,400 --> 00:32:00,400
I touch it. I hesitantly stick my hand in the tank. When I do, my fingers touch something cold.

179
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,560
There's water left inside. Just water. For some reason, Mashita looks disappointed.

180
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,240
Of course. There's enough water left inside that I could scoop it up if I had a container.

181
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,160
I do have a container!

182
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,680
I do have a container! I have... this plastic bottle! Yeah!

183
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,680
I take the plastic bottle out and put it in the tank. It gurgles as it fills with water.

184
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,280
Got bottle of water.

185
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:41,680
Or, as some people say, oh!

186
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,120
What are you gonna do with it? I don't know! I want it! Why? If I can use it, I want it!

187
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,920
Okay, let's look. When you open an umbrella in a typhoon, it will break because the wind's too strong.

188
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,840
So first, I tried to put holes in an umbrella. The way... that way, it wouldn't break a strong wind.

189
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,880
And who would those people be? Hmm?

190
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,600
The British.

191
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,520
Oh my gosh! Okay, I think I need to put on a sweater, Senpai.

192
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
I think I need to put on a sweater, Senpai.

193
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:54,480
British jumpscare. A bit too chilly. Yeah, it's super cold!

194
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,720
I think that's why I'm coughing a lot.

195
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,880
I think that's why I'm coughing a lot because I'm gonna wear this cardigan.

196
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,160
Yeah, I always have a cardigan with me.

197
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,160
And... Blake it up!

198
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,440
It's super hot here. If I had to choose between hot versus cold, I would choose cold.

199
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:41,040
I can be under many layers, but I cannot strip more.

200
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,760
Okay, I cannot remove the skin.

201
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,680
I don't know why.

202
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:02,640
Um, Stroni was wearing a sweater and nothing else.

203
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,560
Oh my!

204
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,920
Who let you remove our skin, Kohei? Really? You'd let me do that?

205
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,720
You would let... you'd let me do that, Senpai? You let me tear your skin off?

206
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,760
No, when using it, put a plastic sheet on it to transform it into an extra strong umbrella.

207
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,400
A strengthened umbrella protects from thorns or branches blown by the wind.

208
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,240
Okay, if I... that's a hint. Yes, that's how kids think.

209
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,040
He acts like he was never a kid himself.

210
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,720
What? No, it's nothing.

211
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,480
Anything else here? We looked there.

212
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,400
I think we already looked here.

213
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,040
Uh, did we?

214
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,880
Anything else? Sparkle.

215
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,600
Now, okay, we're good. Let's get out of here.

216
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,600
Oh my gosh, I misaligned the buttons again!

217
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,600
Okay, there I go.

218
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,000
Okay.

219
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,960
We already went there, it looks like, I think.

220
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,800
Okay, move forward!

221
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,680
The broken window is letting in piercing cold wind. Okay.

222
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,080
What's that?

223
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
The rain coming in from the broken window is making the floor cold and damp.

224
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,880
Are we at the end of the hall? I found you, kid!

225
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,520
Fucking kids.

226
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,720
Climb the stairs.

227
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,840
Anything around here?

228
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,160
Pieces of concrete litter the floor. I think they came from the walls.

229
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,080
Ah, that's why it's cold. Yeah, climb the stairs.

230
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,040
Plies in the snakes cover the hallway. I'd be foolish to keep going.

231
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,440
I decided to go back to the landing. Okay, let's go back down then. Let's go back down.

232
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:25,440
Can we go in here already? I don't know if we can go in here already.

233
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Oh yeah, we did. We're out of here. I explored the heck out of that place.

234
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,200
How many snakes do you need to cover a staircase? A lot!

235
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,880
For one really big one. Wait, go back.

236
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,160
Did I ever look at this?

237
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,800
Look, the light on alarm is very faint. Something might be wrong with it.

238
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,760
I open up and shine the flashlight to see if there's anything inside.

239
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,440
Found a worn-out talisman. When I picked up the worn-out talisman, I feel warmth flow through me.

240
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,040
Got soul power.

241
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,560
The worn-out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

242
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,200
There we go. What is soul power for?

243
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,760
Give me a moment, Senpai.

244
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,600
When you do quick time events and you do the wrong,

245
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:04,640
in each moment, you lose a soul power. So when you lose soul power and it hits zero, you die.

246
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,200
So these worn-out talismans look like they recover that.

247
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,640
Did I go in here already? Yeah, I already went in here.

248
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,360
So help, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Senpai. Yeah, you're so smart, Senpai.

249
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,840
I don't think we went into this room. Use the school key ring and open the door.

250
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,080
I move to step into the classroom.

251
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,920
And suddenly there's a strong grip on my shoulder.

252
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,680
I glance at the hallway out of the corner of my eye.

253
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,120
I'm pretty sure Mashita was on my other side.

254
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,280
No, even if they were on this side, they would have no reason to grab me.

255
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,000
Ah, here it is! Senpai, live or die.

256
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,160
Calm down, I'm just imagining things. My voice doesn't sound very convincing.

257
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,080
Don't panic, it's an illusion. Calm down, hold it together.

258
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,280
And I see Chou enveloped my right side.

259
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,440
I have 3,000 soul power, something's gripping my shoulder.

260
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,880
Oh.

261
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,000
Is that you? Is that you, Mashita?

262
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,000
I turn Mashita and open my mouth to tell them.

263
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,840
One, two, ah!

264
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,460
Safe.

265
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,880
I see a terrifying face in the darkness. Yeah, kids are pretty terrifying, huh?

266
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,920
Kids are terrifying creatures.

267
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,360
And then an outline laying in wait for me.

268
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,640
Oh no, oh no, oh no, what should I do? What should I do?

269
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,440
Uh, I'mma close my eyes! Fuck, close my eyes! Fuck!

270
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,800
Go light, go light!

271
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,400
Excuse my eyes, shut and pray.

272
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:29,120
Safe! Oh yeah! I knew it, if I, I knew it, I knew, I knew if I said something I'm probably gonna

273
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,480
die because this kid hates adults, right? This ghost kid hates adults. So if they hear a deep

274
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:44,240
voice they'll be like, oh my gosh, it's an adult, die! Just then. Hey, what's wrong?

275
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:53,920
With Mashita's voice, the figure vanishes. I find myself standing in front of the door.

276
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,480
Survive. Woo!

277
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,600
The mark burns scarlet. Dawn, half an hour left until death closes in.

278
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,280
We are gonna disregard time because I'm gonna spend a few more hours playing.

279
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:24,400
You okay? Yeah!

280
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,880
Mashita picked something off my left shoulder. This is...

281
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,560
The hand I felt gripping my shoulder was actually a rose thorn.

282
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:51,680
But more importantly, Mashita, what's the matter? You're acting kind of... acting kind of what?

283
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,440
Something's wrong, he's not acting normal.

284
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,800
Amnesia, my heart pangs with worry. Is Mashita spacing out because the mark's curse has progressed?

285
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,200
But I don't understand. I'm still the same, at least as far as I know.

286
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:20,320
Come on, hurt right. Mashita shuffles forward like a zombie. Something is seriously wrong.

287
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,320
Bad. Danger kept on us so quickly for running out of time. This condition might get worse.

288
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,320
I'll figure something out.

289
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:40,960
Okay, here we go. What's that? A white powder substance scattered around. Look.

290
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,920
A coarse powder, a glitters in the glow of the flashlight. Is it, is it cocaine?

291
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,480
I'm not really inclined to sticking it in my mouth to make sure, but it's probably so. Oh, okay.

292
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:10,720
Okay, it's salt. If I had a container, I'd take some with me. I do have a container. I have...

293
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,280
Ball water. My powder seems to be salt. Take out the bottle of water and fill it with powder.

294
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,040
Oh, it's salt water.

295
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:34,960
First purify with sea water. Yeah. I hear that voice again. Sea water. So that would be salt water, then?

296
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,200
Oh, hi. I can't read Japanese. What does this say?

297
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,240
Hey, hey. Oh, that's a lot of words I can't read. I can't read.

298
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,360
The plants are dry and withered.

299
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,920
Say, say, I can't read. I can't read.

300
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,960
Knee, knee, no, no.

301
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,680
Something about your car is extended warranty, probably.

302
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:20,400
Then say, could I? Oh, I hate teacher. Fair.

303
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,480
Fair.

304
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,480
I hate sensei. Got it. There are six office ladies who ride my train. I observed them for 10 days.

305
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,240
So true. When I was a kid, I was like, I don't like my teachers.

306
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,400
I learned popular colors are brown and pink. Everyone's hair is brown and their mouths are pink.

307
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,320
Feel it. Paper is falling apart. Got anyone who would care if I tore it off and took it with me.

308
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,480
Wait, I can take these?

309
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:12,800
I need to go back to the other room. I totally needed to grab those things.

310
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,840
Look. Experiment. I poured different liquids on the weed in my yard to see which was effective.

311
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,320
Results?

312
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,840
C. Miso soup and D. Salt water work. Conclusion. Salt can destroy weeds.

313
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,600
Solving salt in water first makes it easier for the plants to absorb and speed the effects.

314
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,720
Understood.

315
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,000
We'll take that as well. These are hints. We're going to go back and grab the other stuff.

316
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,920
Miso soup, yeah. Anything else? Oh, there's something on the ceiling.

317
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,520
Does the roof have a leak? The ceiling looks stained in places.

318
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,080
Anything else? I'm having this plant thing.

319
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,280
Oops. I didn't mean to do that.

320
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,200
I'm going to go back.

321
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,480
I'm going to go back because clearly we needed that one thing.

322
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,880
I'm going to grab those hints I saw.

323
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,760
Is it this one? Yeah, it was this one. I'm going to grab them.

324
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,920
Eel. Yeah, take it. Take it. Take it. Take it.

325
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:51,120
Miso has a lot of sodium. Oh, yeah, that's true. I like Miso soup. I like the kelp one.

326
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,680
I plan to strengthen weeds. I'm going to take this one, too.

327
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,200
I'm going to take that one, too. Thank you.

328
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,880
Umbrella that withstands typhoon.

329
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,600
We didn't find an umbrella before, did we? Oh, wait, hold on. It's a bed and desk. Look.

330
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,920
Yes, you'll find it at any other school. What's surprising? It doesn't look very weathered.

331
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,800
So that goes to show how durable school desks are.

332
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,280
Deal it. Stick my hand inside and feel around. Something pokes my finger. I grab it and pull

333
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:35,360
it out. Is it the umbrella thing? Yeah! What's it doing here? I have an idea. This umbrella might

334
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,720
have been part of the display for the independent research we found earlier.

335
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,560
Oh, though, what's the point? I'm going to use it.

336
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:49,920
I see the nicely folded dark plastic sheet amongst the garbage. Take it, too.

337
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,920
Their blood denies them. Denies them. Put it together and what have you got?

338
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,920
That conscious thought, I start speaking. Blood denies them. Does that mean repel with blood?

339
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:14,640
I pop open the wire umbrella and I spread the plastic sheet over it.

340
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,000
Huh, just like it says in the research paper, you can create something like an umbrella.

341
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,640
But it's not fast and dawn. It'll be impossible to carry it around like this.

342
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:30,400
But we'll have to hold it together to use it. Thankfully, there are two of us here. One person

343
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,720
to open the umbrella first and one person to spread the sheet. If you manage to combo like that,

344
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,720
we can use the blood stain sheet as an umbrella. Sorry to make you wait.

345
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,800
Right. Ashita gives a big reply. I'm sure it'll come in handy.

346
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,640
I feel like everything is here for a reason. New info was added to the spirit file. Blood stain,

347
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:03,440
umbrella. Okay, okay. We found the umbrella. I was like, okay, clearly we have something.

348
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:14,880
Uh, let's turn back and head this away. Where was I before? I think I was close to the end, right?

349
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,680
Anything else here? No more ugly kids? I don't think I have this ever open. Fire doors,

350
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,720
rested shut and won't move. Okay, that's probably useless then.

351
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,240
Climb the stairs.

352
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,280
Halfway up the stairs, I chip on something. What's this?

353
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,520
Moe's bag is on the staircase.

354
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,240
Got Moe's bag. Inside the bag is some random junk along with her school jacket.

355
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,240
If it's here, that means...

356
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,000
Is Moe still in the school?

357
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,480
But a cracked mirror is the only thing in sight.

358
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,840
If it's counting her bag, there's no trace of Moe anywhere.

359
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,800
In any case, we'll just have to keep looking around.

360
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,640
Isn't I looking now?

361
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,760
Look, it's a crack. There's cracks in the mirror. There's nothing else particularly odd about it.

362
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,360
Ew, my finger down the cracks. Mash it to watch as me wordly, but nothing happens.

363
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,000
Going to go up now?

364
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,680
Climb the stairs. I think we grabbed everything.

365
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,920
Twice in a snake's cover the hallway. Be foolish to try to keep going.

366
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,520
All right, we decide to go back to the landing.

367
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,920
Okay, well, anything else?

368
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,640
Well, do we have her bag? Oops.

369
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,520
Went down the stairs.

370
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,560
Am I missing something?

371
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,080
The broken window is letting piercingly cold air in.

372
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,480
Okay, hold on. Well, we're going to explore some more.

373
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,040
Part of these motherfucking snakes in my motherfucking school.

374
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,000
Okay, I think we checked everything here. We got the salt.

375
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,520
I was hoping to use the salt on it, but I guess I don't need it.

376
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,440
I don't think I need it.

377
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,960
My tonight is, I think, everything in this room.

378
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,960
The dust is so thick on the ceiling that just walking around causes showers of particles.

379
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,000
That's unsafe and unsanitary. I wonder this school is abandoned.

380
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,840
Anything around here?

381
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,240
Ceiling is filthy and the fluorescent lights are broken.

382
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,960
Wait, warning and contacts. Fire-containing warnings and list of contacts.

383
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,600
Do not leave handprints on the mirror in the eastern stairway.

384
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,160
Thank you, Independent Research Presentation, First Floor,

385
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,840
Multi-Purpose Classroom. Come check it out.

386
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,640
Independent Research, huh? Okay.

387
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,520
Uh, deal?

388
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,600
Don't find anything in particular.

389
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:03,760
Okay.

390
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,160
Mercy, can I say how attractive you are? Sempais loves you. Mwah!

391
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,840
And I love you, Sempai. Mwah!

392
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,760
I swear I went through everything. Did I not go through everything?

393
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,480
Okay, hold on.

394
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,040
What does this say? I can't read this either.

395
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,520
There's nonsensical scribbles on the blackboard.

396
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,960
The dust is so thick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, same thing.

397
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,520
Okay, so we're going to assume everything on the ceiling.

398
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,080
Can you do anything with Moe's bag? Here, let me check my bag first.

399
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,640
Oh, I can power Intelligence 11.

400
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,560
Okay, Dexterity 11, Dexterity 6.

401
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,920
What's this? Oh, that's the spirit file.

402
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,880
I have a flare, plastic sheet, school key ring,

403
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,400
a food umbrella, wire umbrella, Moe's bag.

404
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,480
Some textbooks and items of unknown purposes.

405
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,760
Oh, she's in the school! Somewhere, right?

406
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,400
Okay, she might be in that room again.

407
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,720
A wall near the window is burnt. There must have been a fire here a long time ago.

408
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,560
And the door in left the staff room. In here?

409
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,760
Open the glass door and check inside, but there isn't anything that catches my eye.

410
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:10,080
There's an entrance to the underground room. Go to the underground room.

411
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,880
Shall we go in there again? Yeah.

412
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,480
Is there anything else in here?

413
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,520
Right up corpse. Look, body is twisted in odd position as if still in pain even now.

414
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,600
Heal it, hesitantly search the corpse, but I don't find anything.

415
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:42,160
Okay, well, the bad room. Yeah, the bad room full of stuff that happened badly.

416
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,160
I'm checking through all of them, though.

417
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,400
Look, body is twisted in odd position, blah, blah, blah. Okay, touch it.

418
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,880
Okay, find anything about you. Touch it.

419
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,440
Okay, we got something. I hesitantly searched the corpse.

420
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:15,600
Something flashes within the vine by its feet. Got round hand mirror. Like a gift for a young woman.

421
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:25,200
Mark has died in deep crimson. A few minutes left until death closes in.

422
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,320
Shit! A loud noise suddenly rings out.

423
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,560
A terrible pain runs through my wrist. It feels like something's biting into my bone.

424
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:43,600
Ashita? Hey, are you listening? Yeah, I can hear you.

425
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,240
At least he's still replying to me. So, what the way he's acting is.

426
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,680
Can't keep going like this. Move, come on.

427
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,680
Shout rings through the building. New info was added to spirit file. Last hand.

428
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,480
Am I gonna fucking die now?

429
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:21,680
Oh well. R.I.P.

430
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,480
I'm getting, I'm guessing that's the titular death mark? Yeah.

431
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,400
Instant I step into the hallway. A strange, indescribable feeling hits me.

432
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,600
Like a solid presence is closing in on me from deep within the darkness.

433
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:51,680
A router appears out of nowhere. And it runs down the hallway. I thought that was it,

434
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,040
but it stopped the part way. Grim's back is left to see what we're doing.

435
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,360
Hey, wait up. I grabbed Ashita's wrist and chased after it.

436
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:06,400
We chase after the rabbit and we arrive at eastern staircase.

437
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,520
We quickly climb up the stairs and stand in front of the mirror.

438
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,920
Heard it. I look around for the creature.

439
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,680
Just then, red drops of something fall from above.

440
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,800
Scarlet rose petals.

441
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,360
I slowly raise my eyes up to the ceiling.

442
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,720
The instant I see that, I let out a groan.

443
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,240
Okay, over fine. It's fine.

444
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,680
It's heavily weighted with both fear and relief.

445
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,680
Snippets, don't look!

446
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,480
Moe is up there, hanging from rose vines.

447
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,040
It's her. He points at her, strangely amused.

448
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,120
But she's not the only one up there.

449
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,640
It's a corpse hiding in the vines, too. It looks like the guard.

450
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,920
Suddenly, the vines snap like the weight is too much.

451
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,160
Moe crashes painfully up to the ground.

452
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,920
Hey, hang in there!

453
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,880
Yeah. I quickly glance over her to make sure she's not hurt.

454
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,720
The mark is obvious. It's swollen, pulsing, red like a giant.

455
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,360
Like a large, dangerous-looking pomegranate.

456
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,880
It looks like it progressed a lot further than the mark on my wrist.

457
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,960
See, so this is why.

458
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,320
Did she get desperate and come to the school to try to do something?

459
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,800
She did run away.

460
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,560
In any case, I need to get some clothes on her.

461
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,560
Take the jacket out of her bag and slide her arm into a sleeve.

462
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,400
She's still pretty out of it, but she manages to get a rest on by herself.

463
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,320
Huh? Oh, it's you, mister! Why?

464
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,960
The mark's progression must be affecting her, just like Mashita.

465
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,120
I doubt anything that I would say will make sense to her.

466
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,640
Besides, right now...

467
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:19,920
He's here.

468
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,760
And uh, Niko is.

469
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,760
I know, but what should I do? What am I supposed to do?

470
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,160
There's nowhere to hide.

471
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,560
I look at Moe and Mashita, their eyes are unfocused.

472
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,120
We'll die here. We'll all die here.

473
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,680
I'm the only one who might have a chance of overturning that fate.

474
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,320
Gaining the key and letting the grudge befall me by to survive.

475
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:52,960
You'll be required to be callous to make the escape of the spirit appear.

476
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,480
The way to repel the spirit hides within its grudge.

477
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,720
Mary's words echo in my head.

478
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,400
I open my bag and look through everything I picked up throughout the school.

479
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,880
It's one of these, the key, but it all looks like junk!

480
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get through this.

481
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,320
Garbage is all I have.

482
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,320
And Niko.

483
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,160
My first saw him in this mirror, he was just a monster.

484
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,480
Now I feel like I know why he came to be.

485
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,520
I just have to face him.

486
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,280
Believe that I have the final key.

487
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:32,800
Believe.

488
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,400
Trust in myself.

489
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,440
Who's the partner?

490
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,800
Uh, we're gonna choose the girl!

491
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,520
Cause uh, Moe, Moe, Moe!

492
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,920
Ha ha ha ha ha!

493
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,880
I grab them, shake their shoulder and yell.

494
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,720
Get it together!

495
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,920
There's nowhere to hide!

496
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,600
We have to go!

497
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,640
Come with me!

498
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,280
Hanna Hiko.

499
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,800
Uh, because Hanna Hiko hates adults.

500
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,280
Moe, Moe, Q?

501
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,600
Moe, Moe, Q?

502
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,160
Moe makes a big sound.

503
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:10,880
That's good enough.

504
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,320
We're going to release him from his curse!

505
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,080
Ha ha ha ha ha!

506
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,640
Listen here, kid.

507
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,080
Okay, listen here, you- oh, okay.

508
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,320
Hanna Hiko is staring at Moe.

509
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,000
Hey, they aren't a grown-up.

510
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,480
I knew it!

511
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:40,960
I knew it!

512
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,360
I knew it!

513
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,600
Fine, only big people die, okay?

514
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,920
Sound like slithering vines come from Hanna Hiko's direction.

515
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,080
That's gross.

516
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,120
Okay, okay.

517
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,160
So, okay.

518
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,280
Review, review our notes, Senpai, before we continue.

519
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,760
Review our notes.

520
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,120
We have the weed, the plant destroyer,

521
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:25,600
and then we have the thing with the- that can stop thorns.

522
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,080
We're good.

523
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,760
That's salt water.

524
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,320
We got the thorn thingy that will protect us,

525
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,760
and we got the red stuff.

526
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the umbrella.

527
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,600
We got them.

528
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,080
We got it.

529
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,560
We got it.

530
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:50,480
The next thing I know, a sharp- small sharp object raises my face.

531
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,320
Missed.

532
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,920
You won't be so lucky next time.

533
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,120
I get the feeling Hanna Hiko's planning to attack me from a distance.

534
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,520
I need to do something to reach him from this far away.

535
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,080
Facing a spirit.

536
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,040
To defeat a spirit, you must use the item right to item at the right time.

537
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,440
Okay, we got- we got this.

538
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,120
Both you and your partner can use one item each.

539
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,920
Choose according to the situation.

540
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,840
Okay, let's use the umbrella to protect us first.

541
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,600
Item usage limit.

542
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,720
Some items are limited use, so please take care.

543
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,320
Check the number to the right.

544
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,160
Also, some items cannot be used when facing a spirit.

545
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:52,160
By the way, when did you last say uh at the mansion?

546
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,720
Combo actions.

547
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,680
When facing a spirit, two items can be used together.

548
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,120
This is a combo action.

549
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:11,840
It is executed if you and your partner use the right items.

550
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,160
Did I use- do I- okay, we have the umbrella, right?

551
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,880
So do we need to use the tarp and the umbrella at the same time,

552
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,200
or do we already have that kind of made?

553
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,320
I can't remember.

554
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,920
I can't remember if I did that or not.

555
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,680
I think we've already made it, right?

556
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,960
But someone has to hold it.

557
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,320
I'll figure it out.

558
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,160
It works as a combo?

559
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,160
You think it works as a combo?

560
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,320
Okay, we'll probably have to use the combo then.

561
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,560
Strategy hint.

562
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,840
You can read the spirit file or item descriptions at any time.

563
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,200
Open your bag using Y.

564
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,840
Okay, well.

565
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,680
You use- okay, oh yeah, it has to be used as together.

566
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,080
Wire umbrella.

567
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,080
Uh, a six sheet.

568
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,720
Yes, yes, yes.

569
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,320
The umbrella and then the plastic sheet.

570
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:35,600
Yes.

571
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,360
I put the plastic sheet over the wire umbrella.

572
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,040
I ready to cobble together an umbrella.

573
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,720
This should be able to block the thorns.

574
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,040
What the heck is that?

575
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,800
That umbrella, he's in my way.

576
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,680
His cold voice rings out,

577
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,880
sounding slightly angry.

578
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,960
Kind of he goes shoots a red- a rose thorn.

579
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,560
Thorn fires as fast as bullets,

580
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,480
but only bounces off the bloodstained sheet.

581
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,480
Yes, yes, yes, we got this.

582
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,760
Their blood- their blood denies him,

583
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,800
so that's what it meant.

584
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,680
The impact of the thorn causes the sheet to start to fall off the umbrella.

585
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,840
We don't put it back on.

586
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,200
We won't be able to protect ourselves.

587
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,800
Okay, we're close, we're close, we're close.

588
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,040
Kind of he goes sways closer,

589
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,520
as if the umbrella is irritating him.

590
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,160
Um, do I do it again?

591
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,560
Ten pies, do you think I do it again?

592
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,720
How close does he- does Hanahiko need to be,

593
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,520
so I can be like,

594
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,840
Behold!

595
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,640
Salt water!

596
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,080
Why do I just do salt water now?

597
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,600
He might be able to do something if he comes a little closer.

598
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,040
Okay, he has to come a little closer.

599
01:09:51,040 --> 01:10:00,720
How to weaken spirits.

600
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,520
Okay, okay, okay.

601
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,120
Okay, one more time.

602
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,000
To defeat a spirit,

603
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,240
you must use a specific item to weaken them.

604
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,560
It can't be used until the spirit is as close as possible.

605
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,000
Okay, we have to protect again,

606
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,200
and then yes, yes,

607
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,560
we'll have to protect again,

608
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,080
and then we'll use the salt water,

609
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:23,680
I think,

610
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,480
and yeah.

611
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,120
And then the red thing, right?

612
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,640
Give me the red thing,

613
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,480
so the red thing I think is the lipstick.

614
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,360
When that happens,

615
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,000
the green- the screen outline will glow red,

616
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,240
and deer the spirits attack until they are in range.

617
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,240
Okay, it's not red yet,

618
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:52,000
so um, classic cheat.

619
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,000
Wire umbrella.

620
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,840
It's not red yet, is it?

621
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,280
Yeah.

622
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,080
It's still green.

623
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,320
Put the wire umbrella over the plastic sheet,

624
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,000
and he goes to choose a red thorn.

625
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,600
Okay, okay, is this- is this red?

626
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:18,800
Is this red?

627
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,840
Ten pies, is this red?

628
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,560
Not yet.

629
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,160
Do we do it again, then?

630
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:48,080
One more time.

631
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,600
Put the wire umbrella over the plastic sheet.

632
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,200
And he goes to choose a red thorn.

633
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,880
Is it close now?

634
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,760
Is it red now?

635
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,080
Yes, this is red!

636
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,960
And he goes- comes up close.

637
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:21,200
Countless vines wriggle in his oddly shaped head.

638
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,560
They're like poisonous snakes about to strike their prey.

639
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,400
At this distance, the umbrella is pretty useless.

640
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,520
It's obvious I'll be killed instantly if I don't do anything.

641
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,240
This close distance is my only chance.

642
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,440
Should I use an attack against spirit,

643
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,680
or an attack against plants?

644
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,320
Is there a way I can fight back?

645
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,640
Yeah, let's use-

646
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,000
The salt water,

647
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,120
and Moe,

648
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,760
the lipstick, right?

649
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,280
Right, right, ten pies?

650
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,800
We use the red- the red.

651
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,680
Yes, use the red!

652
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,040
Right?

653
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,480
Right, right, right!

654
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:05,600
Red!

655
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,560
Salt water!

656
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,680
Darling throws the salt water at Hanahiko!

657
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,600
Vines hit the salt water, quickly stops moving.

658
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,640
In the hazy darkness, I can see Hanahiko's face

659
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,160
twisting in pain.

660
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:29,840
Oh, mean.

661
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,640
Are you going to tease me now too, mister?

662
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,760
He starts sniffling as if he's about to cry.

663
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,000
It looks weakened.

664
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,880
Hanah defeats spirits!

665
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,760
A- defeat a weakened spirit by using specific items.

666
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,840
Choose an item based on the info you gathered.

667
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,920
You only have one chance, then carefully.

668
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,960
It's the red lipstick!

669
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,120
I got the lipstick.

670
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,160
Put the lipstick on Hanahiko's lips.

671
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,560
What did you do?

672
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,720
Hanahiko is weakened.

673
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,240
Lipstick again?

674
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,440
Do we use the lipstick again?

675
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,000
What do we do?

676
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,440
Ten pies!

677
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:31,680
Mirror, mirror, and then lipstick!

678
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,360
Lipstick!

679
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:47,680
Yeah!

680
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,400
Show, use lipstick!

681
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,400
Be gone!

682
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,400
Smear the lipstick on him and try to place the mirror in front.

683
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,880
Put the lipstick on Hanahiko and place the mirror in front of him.

684
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,120
He stares at his reflection.

685
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,880
This is red stuff.

686
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,040
I've been looking for this for so long.

687
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,280
The keepsake from my mom.

688
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,040
Are these memories from when he was alone?

689
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:17,840
I don't know.

690
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,560
I don't know.

691
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,120
I don't know.

692
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:19,840
I don't know.

693
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,560
I don't know.

694
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,120
I don't know.

695
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:21,840
I don't know.

696
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,200
Memories from when he was alive?

697
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,520
He smiles with his red lips.

698
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,760
Am I pretty?

699
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:34,640
We did it.

700
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,720
The spirit mounts into the darkness with a smile on his face.

701
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,720
I don't sense Hanahiko anymore.

702
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,440
Did we win?

703
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,040
Seriously?

704
01:15:59,280 --> 01:15:59,600
Yeah.

705
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,560
Kind of hard to believe, but looks like we did.

706
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:06,720
Mister!

707
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,640
My mark disappeared!

708
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,440
Well, I cheers as she studies her leg.

709
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Her mark has been burned into a right thigh.

710
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,720
Oh, what about yours?

711
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,720
Oh yeah, my right hand.

712
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,640
It's still there.

713
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,440
My mark looks exactly the same as before.

714
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:28,880
Why?

715
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,000
Why isn't it going away?

716
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,520
Sorry, mister.

717
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:35,680
It's almost gone.

718
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,320
Am I going to die?

719
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,360
So this is where you've been.

720
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,840
My head suddenly stopped feeling fuzzy.

721
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:46,800
Then my mark was gone.

722
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,320
Looks like you did it.

723
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:50,480
Yeah.

724
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,840
But he still has his mark.

725
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:57,760
Let's head back.

726
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,600
Maybe Mary knows something.

727
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:01,840
Yeah, you're right.

728
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:03,760
Come on, mister.

729
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,240
Let's go.

730
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,800
Oh, it leads the way.

731
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:11,940
Huh?

732
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,520
Oh, he's digging around her bag.

733
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,360
Oh no, my wallet's missing.

734
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,480
I dropped it earlier.

735
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,680
Her glance back at the school is confused.

736
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,280
But you're definitely more important right now.

737
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,480
We've got to hurry and get back.

738
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:32,720
Go on.

739
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:33,940
Huh?

740
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,480
Let's make sure you're back in five minutes.

741
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,080
Go get moving.

742
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,920
Great, great, thanks!

743
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,880
The boy rushes back into the school.

744
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,160
You're pretty calm considering.

745
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,520
The boy shrinks in the distance until they disappear inside the building.

746
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,000
The bitingly cold wind just whips past me.

747
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,200
It's coming from the school.

748
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,440
That's not normal, especially for the start of summer.

749
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,960
Wind dies down and out of nowhere I get a really bad feeling.

750
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,160
Wait, no!

751
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,280
I have like Moeco back inside.

752
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,760
Five minutes pass.

753
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,120
Wait, did I fuck up?

754
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,520
Moe isn't back yet.

755
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,160
Idiot, this is no time to doaddle.

756
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:31,520
Better check.

757
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,800
I step inside and go down the right hall.

758
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,520
Make it all the way to the front room where we fought Hanahiko, but...

759
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,680
I don't see Moe anywhere.

760
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,560
Strange, this should be the place.

761
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,120
It missed her?

762
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,840
Scared the crap out of me.

763
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,320
Fucking hell bitch, what the fuck, that was five minutes longer!

764
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,640
What are you doing here?

765
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,840
You're late so I came looking for you.

766
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,200
She's alive!

767
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,640
We saved our... our... our Kohai?

768
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

769
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,920
It's dark so it took longer.

770
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,160
I should have borrowed the flashlight.

771
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,480
She bows in apology.

772
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,480
I'm so relieved a huge weight lifts off my shoulders when I see she's okay.

773
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,920
Hey, let's get a move on already.

774
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,600
Kohai saved a Kohai, yeah!

775
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,080
We all climb into the car and head straight to Kujo Mansion.

776
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,120
I almost thought I fucked up somehow.

777
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:02,960
I'll come back.

778
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,400
My mark's gone, so that must mean we beat Hanahiko, right?

779
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,720
This Moe seems to be okay too.

780
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,640
I'm pretty amazing.

781
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:12,720
Huh?

782
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,080
What's wrong?

783
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,040
You're not smiling.

784
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,960
Well, his mark hasn't disappeared.

785
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,080
What?

786
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,200
Why not?

787
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,440
Hey, darling?

788
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,480
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

789
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,040
I'll fill the pip squeak in.

790
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,920
You go hear what Mary has to say.

791
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,800
Welcome back, Lord Darling.

792
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,960
It appears you overcame your fear and cleared away the grudge.

793
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,120
Congratulations are in order.

794
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,920
Your tone is the same as always, but for some reason it grates me.

795
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,240
What's so great about it?

796
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,840
Why hasn't my mark vanished?

797
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,880
It is likely the one who gave it was not Hanahiko.

798
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,760
I'm suddenly light-headed, the world fading.

799
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,240
I'd risked my life during that investigation, and it was completely useless to me.

800
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,880
I guess all that's left is waiting for Dawn and my death.

801
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:35,760
Alright, darling?

802
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,640
Senpai, darling, is going to be constantly rizzed up by everyone in this game.

803
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,000
Sure is.

804
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,120
At least we saved everyone.

805
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:49,680
Yeah.

806
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,360
I thought I had a moment where I was like,

807
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,680
DUNNNNNNNNNNNN!

808
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,960
FUCK UP, I SMEEE!

809
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,600
If it is alright with you, would you mind showing me your mark?

810
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,640
I hold my arm out towards Mary.

811
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,440
Her neck shifts slightly as she stares at the mark.

812
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,440
It is as I thought.

813
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:21,440
It is only a minuscule fraction, but the fate I sensed from this mark has been distorted.

814
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:25,440
What does that mean?

815
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,440
Is it because I beat Hanahiko?

816
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:38,440
The flame of your life was indeed fading at one point, but now it has become brighter.

817
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,440
Are you saying?

818
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:44,440
What if the mark was on the butt cheek, just though?

819
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,440
Then I guess you have to check out your butt cheek.

820
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,440
She's going to have to look at your butt cheek.

821
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:54,440
Isn't that right, Senpai?

822
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,440
I'm not going to die at dawn.

823
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:05,440
That is correct.

824
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,440
My sigh of relief is so deep, it feels like my soul is escaping my body.

825
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:14,440
If only Kohai allows it.

826
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:24,440
Well, I mean, I don't want my Senpai to die, not by my hand.

827
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:28,440
So I guess you'll have to check it for me.

828
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:45,440
But at the same time, any funny business and you will die before dawn anyways.

829
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:50,440
The mark's still burned on me, but it seems I'll be okay for now.

830
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:57,440
Life or death?

831
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:05,440
Your choice, quick time events, Senpai.

832
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,440
It appears the mark- wait, sorry.

833
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:14,440
It appears the mark you bear is different from the other ones I know of.

834
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:19,440
But there is no doubt that it was given to you by a spirit.

835
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:24,440
Then there are other spirits like Hanahiko that gives people marks?

836
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:32,440
Yes.

837
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,440
Spirit-born.

838
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:40,440
Spirit-born of grudges have an insatiable hatred for the living.

839
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:46,440
This persistent hatred is not seen by simply killing the living.

840
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:51,440
Rather, they drag their victims to the depths of despair before their death.

841
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,440
That is what they desire.

842
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:58,440
The mark is an effective method.

843
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,440
Spirits who wish to terrorize the living.

844
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,440
The more- the more I hear them, the less I understand.

845
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:11,440
It appears something within each city can easily create such spirits.

846
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:15,440
Though I could not say what it is.

847
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:21,440
So for me to escape my mark, I need to find the spirit that gave it to me and take care of it then?

848
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:27,440
Yes, it is logical to believe the mark would disappear, the spirit.

849
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:34,440
That is the only way to escape death and regain your memories.

850
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,440
Great!

851
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:42,440
It will soon be done. I'm sure that you are all tired. Please rest.

852
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:47,440
You are free to use any room.

853
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:53,440
Thank you so much! Seriously! If you hadn't been there, I probably would have been killed by Hanahiko.

854
01:25:53,440 --> 01:26:03,440
But when I think about you still having your mark, it's hard to be happy.

855
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:10,440
Well, I'm going to bed. Good night!

856
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:15,440
You did great work today. You're much more competent than all other adults I know.

857
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,440
Though it only makes sense for adults to help children.

858
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:24,440
It will be challenging from now on. My schoolwork has suffered due to my memory loss.

859
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,440
I need to study hard to catch up. You do your best too.

860
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:33,440
Well then, good night.

861
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:41,440
Think of, I'm heading off myself. With that mess of trouble taken care of, I'm sure I'll crash right away.

862
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:45,440
Alright, here have this.

863
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:51,440
He pulls a small paper item from his beat-up coat and hands it to me. Looks like a newspaper article.

864
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,440
It's about that boy who died before he was adopted. He lived with his mom.

865
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:01,440
She understood her son, unlike his hard and adoptive father.

866
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:06,440
Father should put makeup on him in front of a mirror. Very much doted on him.

867
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:13,440
After all that hell at a young age and dying, that was probably his only good memory.

868
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:24,440
Now she does smile, sad. Well, it's up to you how you interpret it. Do whatever you want. See ya!

869
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:31,440
Alright, darling, there's something I must tell only you.

870
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:36,440
About those who lost their marks, they must leave in the morning.

871
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:42,440
Those who escaped their fate should return to their daily lives. That is the will of Lady Zaya.

872
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:49,440
So I'll be the only one left behind? I feel like a student repeating a grade.

873
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:58,440
Alright, darling, by any chance, are you uneasy about being the solo occupants in this mansion?

874
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:03,440
Uh, Senpai, what should we say?

875
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:10,440
Kind of, eh? Not at all. You're here. You're here? Okay, I'll say, well, you're here.

876
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:15,440
Riz time.

877
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:22,440
Not at all? Yeah, we're gonna Riz.

878
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:32,440
I must express my extreme gratitude that you hold me in such regard. Although the things I am capable of, they are rather limited.

879
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:40,440
Mary stairs unblinkingly in. I could just be extrapolating, but it seems like she's thinking about something.

880
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:52,440
Now then, Lord Darling, it would be for the best that you take your rest as well. Please find me when you are ready.

881
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,440
Farewell.

882
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:58,440
Oh, she's a doll? Yeah, she's a doll.

883
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:05,440
New info was added to the spirit file. Mashi just collection of articles, other.

884
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:13,440
Uh, I forgot how to save here. Wait, next save. Ha ha!

885
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,440
Yeah, let's rest.

886
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,440
Good night.

887
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:45,440
So we can Riz the doll and, uh, not die? It doesn't count, right?

888
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:58,440
Another night greets me. It's been three days since the investigation and not one glimmer of hope for me.

889
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:03,440
Time idles by as death draws even closer to claim me.

890
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:16,440
The mark that brings death. The only way to escape it is to defeat the spirit that gave it to me.

891
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:28,440
But I have no clue where that spirit is right now. Maybe things would be different if that specialist Sayakujo was alive.

892
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:33,440
The knock breaks my train of thought.

893
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:39,440
Oh hey! Oh hey! Look, Senpai, it's our not boyfriend!

894
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,440
Our not boyfriend for our very manly sa-

895
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,440
How long do you plan on sleeping?

896
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:57,440
You're pretty relaxed for a guy who could die soon. Can you raise him up maybe?

897
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:15,440
The ex-detective Satoru, Satoru, Satoru Mashita, the other markbearer left the mansion, but he stayed behind. Mary was the cause. I guess she asked him to help as he was leaving.

898
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:22,440
She went against Sayakujo's wishes by doing that, but it seems it was for my sake.

899
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:35,440
But I don't know about Mashita. Even if he was asked to stay, he has no reason to agree.

900
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:41,440
What's that look? Not happy I stayed behind? No! Very happy!

901
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,440
I'm grateful! We're going to Rizz!

902
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,440
We're gonna Rizz, we're gonna Rizz, okay? I'm grateful.

903
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:56,440
Cut that out, it's creepy. Damn it! Damn it!

904
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,440
Why am I always shot down?

905
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:17,440
We have no Rizz mercy, this is what happens. Why do we have none? We can't win the maw.

906
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:22,440
Man, I was hoping that it would be like, darling.

907
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:29,440
Flatter me all you want, but I won't forget you drove without a license.

908
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:34,440
Wait, that's what you're mad about! Also, I do have a license, Senpai.

909
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:39,440
Do you have a license, Senpai? I wouldn't shoot you down, mercy. Oh, nice.

910
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:46,440
Nice! He's over mad over that!

911
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,440
Of course I do, okay, okay.

912
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,440
The criminal debuff, we have to be a good citizen now.

913
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:03,440
He's got a bad mouth, as usual. I've got my learner's permit.

914
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,440
What's keeping Senpai from getting the whole license?

915
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,440
No, sorry, Kohai, it's okay.

916
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,440
Learn together.

917
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,440
And your driving instructor called you Vomit Girl.

918
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,440
I still got my license.

919
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:34,440
I still got my license, even though to this day that driving instructor probably remembers me after vomiting in the car.

920
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:44,440
His true intention aside, I have to say I'm honestly grateful for his help.

921
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,440
Now the question is, do you have a car to use said license? Yeah.

922
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:56,440
Well, it's the family car, but I have a car.

923
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,440
My car is...

924
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:07,440
is a Toyota.

925
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,440
It's a RAV4.

926
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:21,440
My amnesia could hit without warning, so I can't go wherever I want.

927
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,440
A car is a car. A car is a car.

928
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,440
How many bad Senpais have you ran over with it?

929
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:36,440
I prefer to just chase all my own.

930
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,440
And how many crashes have you had?

931
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,440
Two. Not at fault, though.

932
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,440
Not at fault accidents. Both of them.

933
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,440
Yeah, doing it with the car isn't as intimate. You're right.

934
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:02,440
Both times was not at fault.

935
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:07,440
Is your insurance up to date? Oh, Kohai, yeah!

936
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,440
Were they bad crashes?

937
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:20,440
One of them was, and the other one...

938
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,440
My car was written off, the first car was written off,

939
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,440
but it was not my fault. I was parked,

940
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:32,440
I was stopped at a pedestrian crossing with pedestrians crossing,

941
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,440
and a car ran into my butt, the car butt,

942
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,440
and then I got like a concussion and stuff,

943
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,440
but it's not bad. I'm still here.

944
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,440
Were they texting and driving? I don't fucking know.

945
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:58,440
And the other one was like, just like a tiny, tiny thing.

946
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,440
So yeah, I was like, what the heck?

947
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,440
What the heck?

948
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:15,440
So yeah, it was just a long process, and I'm okay.

949
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:19,440
And I've also updated my insurance recently.

950
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:23,440
Right before, right before I joined VLR,

951
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,440
I updated my insurance and I was super stressed about it.

952
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,440
Because like, the cost of insurance went up, and I cried.

953
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:38,440
I cried a little.

954
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,440
Not because like, it was a while ago,

955
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,440
so it's not because of an accident or anything,

956
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,440
and my premiums went up, it's just all,

957
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,440
everything went up in price.

958
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,440
Did you remember the registration as well?

959
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,440
I'm registered, yeah.

960
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,440
I'm registered, don't worry, everything's good.

961
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,440
Gotta love price hikes, yeah.

962
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:12,440
Car insurance is cringe, but I have to have car insurance,

963
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:16,440
otherwise it's, otherwise it's not great.

964
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,440
Call hi, that doesn't sound convincing.

965
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:25,440
Well, I'm pretty sure everything's up to date, and I'm pretty sure.

966
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:29,440
I'm pretty sure.

967
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,440
Mama and Papa take care of the license plates registration,

968
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:35,440
and then I just have to take care of my drivers,

969
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,440
my driver stuff, yeah.

970
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:41,440
Anyways, this economy sucks.

971
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,440
Insurance is expensive.

972
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,440
How often do you drive?

973
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:55,440
Oh, like almost every day, depending.

974
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,440
Maybe more like every other day.

975
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,440
More like every other day because, you know,

976
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,440
sometimes I want to go out with my friends, right?

977
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,440
Don't forget the tire change for summer and the auto change.

978
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,440
Surprise, shut up!

979
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,440
Are you a good driver?

980
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,440
I would say I'm a good driver.

981
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,440
I would say I'm a good driver.

982
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,440
At least a defensive driver.

983
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,440
Anyways, surprise, shut up!

984
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,440
I think everything's, I know, I know, I know.

985
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,440
Everything, everything, everything is fine, I think.

986
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,440
I think everything's fine.

987
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,440
Is your state inspection up to date?

988
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,440
I'm sure everything's fine.

989
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,440
What about break, shut, shut up!

990
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,440
I'm sure everything's fine.

991
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,440
I'm sure everything's fine.

992
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,440
I'm sure everything's fine.

993
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,440
Listen, as your senpais, we worry about our coil.

994
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

995
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:18,440
The jacks in the car, the spare tire is still there.

996
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,440
What about your air filter?

997
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,440
Stop!

998
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,440
Everything's up to date!

999
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,440
Everyone, yes!

1000
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,440
The lights are fine!

1001
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,440
I checked them!

1002
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,440
I checked the batteries!

1003
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,440
The oil is fine!

1004
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,440
Gas is fine!

1005
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,440
Brake pads are fine!

1006
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,440
I feel like, I feel like...

1007
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,440
I feel like, you know...

1008
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,440
I feel like...

1009
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,440
I feel like, you know...

1010
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,440
I feel like...

1011
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,440
I feel like...

1012
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,440
I feel like, you know...

1013
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,440
I feel like...

1014
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,440
Senpais are like...

1015
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,440
are like my parents now.

1016
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,440
Did you lock it?

1017
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,440
It's in the garage!

1018
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,440
Did you lock your garage?

1019
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,440
Did they lock?

1020
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,440
It's done!

1021
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,440
We're playing the game, Senpais!

1022
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,440
Stop, stop, stop!

1023
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,440
Wait, are you playing to escape using my car?

1024
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,440
I don't know...

1025
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,440
I don't know...

1026
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,440
I don't know...

1027
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,440
I don't know...

1028
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,440
I don't know...

1029
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,440
I don't know...

1030
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,440
I don't know...

1031
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,440
I don't know...

1032
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,440
I don't know...

1033
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,440
I don't know...

1034
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,440
I don't know...

1035
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,440
I don't know...

1036
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,440
I don't know...

1037
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,440
Senpai...

1038
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,440
Senpai...

1039
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:51,440
We're gonna have to teach you another lesson again!

1040
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,440
We're gonna have to teach you another lesson again!

1041
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,440
If you really love the Senpais, you give us the key!

1042
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,440
Yeah, I'll give you a key!

1043
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,440
I gave you the key to my heart,

1044
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,440
and now you're gonna betray me, you bastards!

1045
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,440
It's time!

1046
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,440
It's time you learn another lesson, okay?

1047
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,440
We're gonna do...

1048
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,440
some broken legs!

1049
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,440
...

1050
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:31,440
WAAAH!!!

1051
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,440
...

1052
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,440
I saw some people from the force!

1053
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,440
...

1054
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,440
...

1055
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,440
...

1056
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,440
...

1057
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,440
still no ruckus over H Elementary.

1058
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,440
...

1059
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,440
...

1060
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,440
Ugh!

1061
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:56,060
that guard went missing his company should be notified that company is

1062
01:42:56,060 --> 01:43:00,720
exactly the issue it's run by yakuza thugs who have their eyes on the labor

1063
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:05,000
department I know what the place involved plus in a shitty company like

1064
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,980
that people up and walk out all the time yeah machita that was his name

1065
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:13,760
everyone thinks he up and split here that's why they're having a hard time

1066
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:19,600
finding replacement if you didn't know the school was haunted it would just be

1067
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,760
another abandoned building the government wouldn't need to rush to find a

1068
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:27,480
new guard the man lived alone so I'm missing person report won't be filed

1069
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:32,280
soon the school most likely won't come under suspicion until then that's it for

1070
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:36,600
my report he covered a lot of ground in a short time ex-detectives sure are

1071
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:45,040
handy did you bring up the markers periods or when you were asking around do

1072
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:50,720
you think I'm an idiot I'd be calling the looney bin even if the kids or I

1073
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:57,480
bring them up who'd honestly believe us why waste my breath

1074
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:03,800
exasperated he shrugs searching the mansion searching the mansion was on

1075
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:10,680
was on you so did you find anything I came up blank as well though I only

1076
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:18,840
gone through half so far and some of the rooms were lost stuck without a warrant

1077
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:24,360
like you'd wait for something like that I swallowed the words before they came

1078
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:35,000
out oh yeah Mary's asking for you you should get going to be fair nine out of

1079
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:41,680
ten abandoned buildings are haunted are they I've been waiting for you Mary is

1080
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:46,280
sitting primly on the couch the same as always

1081
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:55,240
source yes have that has some pies have you seen a ghost

1082
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:03,320
it appears you're having a difficult time with your investigation I do wish I

1083
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:09,680
be of more use to you I know you can sense mark bearers can you send spirits

1084
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:20,040
to if they were to come onto the grounds I believe I could yes ghost don't pay rent

1085
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:33,000
or taxes I feel like if you ever move into into the into like a place that's

1086
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:41,520
haunted I feel like I would demand the ghost to pay rent I think I would demand

1087
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:55,000
the ghost to pay rent why did you bring up another I think I would force it to

1088
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:05,080
pay rent probably it's only fair I think I'd like to be roommates with a ghost I

1089
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:12,080
don't know they seem invasive you know invasive like you never really have true

1090
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:17,680
privacy with a ghost around do ghosts have money I'm sure there's way for them

1091
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:31,480
to make money that doesn't sound particularly useful do you have any

1092
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:37,320
other abilities or powers like for example you know maybe they can be like a

1093
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:43,280
detective like a detective and then though they can go into houses and figure

1094
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:55,480
out if people are having affairs or they can you do guard stuff right maybe

1095
01:46:55,480 --> 01:47:02,160
they can get money they can watch people at your passwords or pins you have any

1096
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:09,160
cage ghost cage for the senpais who die the senpais who die won't even have

1097
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,160
spirits

1098
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:24,160
why do you have spirits

1099
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:32,160
why not they'll probably be exercised by by mama mama mercy

1100
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:52,160
indeed I can view the big shape of the car course of a person's life predicting the future

1101
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:57,160
a lot of me and mama mercy are cool like that

1102
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,160
um

1103
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:10,160
no no I don't think she would like it either so should probably exercise you anyways

1104
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:21,160
oh no nothing quite so extreme it is more akin to fortune telling it may or may not come to pass

1105
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:30,160
I get it that's why what you predicted earlier didn't actually happen

1106
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:36,160
did Mary tell you something

1107
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:45,160
can we just stay in the cage regardless you can stay in the cage of course

1108
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:49,160
well that's your home senpai

1109
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:56,160
the truth you're seeking can be found here or something such like a fool I felt

1110
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:59,160
so convinced such an idiot

1111
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:18,160

anyway you guys knows her yeah would you hear me out

1122
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:19,160
introductions are quickly done his name is soul Nagashima as we guess he's got a mark

1123
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:27,160
he rolls up his right sleeve to show us and yep the red mark is burned in

1124
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:33,160
and a cult freak friend says some

1125
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:39,160
like it gives you a knee job for real

1126
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:53,160
yeah that's true I can't even remember my real name you're kind of too calm for

1127
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:55,160
all that

1128
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:00,160
but you're pulling a fast one on me

1129
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:06,160
what am I doing

1130
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:12,160
that greats but the reaction is normal

1131
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:18,160
but if he's not gonna believe the rumors then he's got no he has no reason to come

1132
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:26,160
why is he here then

1133
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:34,160
how rumors of just that I need you're on dying cuz of some mock that's comic book

1134
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:38,160
craziness craziness

1135
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:47,160
every word of it is true every word of it is true well what's that a ghost voice

1136
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:56,160
there's a saying the truth is stranger than fiction

1137
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:03,160
there are two sides of the same calling Mary begins explaining I'm sure she

1138
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:07,160
figured out it would be fastest way to convince him

1139
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:18,160
you got some damn speaker set up somewhere don't you don't you know I don't

1140
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:25,160
take kind of wait wait I don't take kindly the threats I don't take kindly the

1141
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:36,160
threats he peers closely at Mary that's a mechanism does not exist large

1142
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:45,160
no way no way

1143
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:53,160
he yells pathetically his eyes wide and suddenly falls flat on his ass

1144
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:03,160
you seem to that despite appearances this punk is terrified of ghosts and

1145
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:15,160
monsters he is tough act is likely a cover after that he meekly pays full

1146
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:20,160
attention to Mary as she speaks he listens quietly his face pale as she

1147
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:26,160
tells him about the mark and spirits by the time she finishes explaining his

1148
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:33,160
face is devoid of color now large show have you not already experienced the

1149
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:42,160
beginning of memory loss yeah I don't think he's used to marry it his face is

1150
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:48,160
rather stiff my memory has always been crap so I thought I was imagining

1151
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:57,160
things but now it's started so bad it was just ridiculous I got this occult

1152
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:05,160
friend yeah told him about my scar the mock and he scared the shit out of me

1153
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:11,160
showed me an article that said it was all the scars things fall

1154
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:21,160
so now I'm here

1155
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:32,160
Molly mentioned seeing an article by Sayaku Joe in a magazine to it's all

1156
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:42,160
because of some monster the hell this is crazy why this has to happen to me

1157
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:49,160
not believing is normal if you don't you die if you don't want to kick the bucket

1158
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:54,160
figure out how you got the mark even if your memory's gone bad you should at least

1159
01:55:54,160 --> 01:56:02,160
remember that I'm not that far gone thanks

1160
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:36,160
I think I think I definitely I'm going a little bit too silly hey I'm positive I

1161
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:43,160
got in the fullest but each cast so I know I did I mean it does have a womb

1162
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:51,160
about it the place being cursed so we should probably ask him more about it

1163
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:59,160
forest the huge forest west of the city wait doesn't everybody everyone know

1164
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:09,160
that even kids do but I've lost my memory maybe that's why I don't know about it

1165
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:15,160
places the city's garbage dump bunch of nasty rumors about it there's a legal

1166
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:23,160
industry industrial waste dumping there like all the time it's not just objects

1167
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:29,160
either say a black car once dumped a young woman's body there a new mother

1168
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:36,160
strangled her kid there because she could take it care of it did they say it

1169
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:43,160
instead of of it okay yeah there's ton more rumors like that whether or not any

1170
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:50,160
of them are true I heard some of those too like the gloss kid who'd eaten by dog

1171
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:55,160
and they only found his torso or that murderous hides out there and kills

1172
01:57:55,160 --> 01:58:09,160
anyone gets near apparently while he hates ghost he's got more than fine with this

1173
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:19,160
kind of stuff I've hit up the edge of the forest a few times but never walked in

1174
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:25,160
no one would have a plane

1175
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:32,160
what should I ask next it's cursed

1176
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:41,160
a plane sorry I said plane

1177
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:48,160
Joe stiffens like a board I hate that supernatural crap

1178
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:59,160
I'm starting to let go we'll talk with this

1179
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:08,160
just talking about it freaks me out

1180
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:17,160
what a wimp

1181
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:25,160
New York

1182
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:31,160
rumor exists for a reason that place is a famous suicide spot 50 people die

1183
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:37,160
there a year so they say and that's just what they find once there was a mass

1184
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:43,160
suicide has a fair share of grizzly history

1185
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:51,160
shows eyes are wide he looks like he swallowed a bug what should I ask

1186
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:58,160
next why were you there I was obviously on my bike man places totally empty at

1187
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:04,160
night so it's perfect for driving around riding around free as a bird helps me

1188
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:08,160
clear my mind

1189
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:15,160
before you ask yes I have my license and no illegal mods

1190
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:21,160
huh is that so

1191
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:25,160
we don't need another person flaunting the law when it's enough

1192
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:37,160
I smile Riley Riley who would have thought this kid would be on the straight and narrow

1193
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:43,160
that day I was clearing my head when my bike broke down

1194
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:50,160
I'm so sad

1195
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:55,160
I stopped to check it out then suddenly I got the scar

1196
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:59,160
I definitely get any more out of show

1197
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:06,160
no info on the spirit then you haven't forgotten anything no keeping secrets now

1198
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:12,160
quit strong on me hold your horses I'm thinking

1199
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:19,160
he's complaining but I can see he's really coming through his memories

1200
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:25,160
there was some I wasn't a ghost or nothing but I did spot some weird

1201
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:30,160
over by the side of the road I saw this huge man

1202
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:37,160
a giant huge

1203
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:42,160
sounds like you're plugging your nose oh shut up

1204
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:48,160
what is this accent anymore I don't know and I'm still gonna wing it some pie and you're gonna like it

1205
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:51,160
a wound

1206
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:54,160
it wasn't just some trees shadow

1207
02:01:54,160 --> 02:02:03,160
honestly I'm not sure the place was pretty dark and I only saw it for a second

1208
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:08,160
it sounds pretty heavy

1209
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:13,160
is that the is that info really reliable

1210
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:20,160
may I interject in truth there are a number of supernatural rumors out there

1211
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:27,160

the rumors if she meal

1213
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:39,160
it sounds like Mary has an idea

1214
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:42,160
could you tell us more about it

1215
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:47,160

02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:43,160

1225
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:49,160
do you like these

1226
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:52,160
college student heard the rumor decided to go to the forces

1227
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:56,160

02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:00,160

it's gonna be ninja scroll all over the again

1231
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,160
I really hated that guy

1232
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:16,160
my try phobia is gonna go crazy

1233
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:21,160
my try phobia is gonna go crazy

1234
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:30,160
I love bees I just I like I like holes

1235
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:34,160
and a man covered in splotches really did appear

1236
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:39,160
no I'm not allergic to bees but I love I love bees I just don't like holes

1237
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:43,160
you know like the holes the student left you like bees

1238
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:47,160
yeah sure I like him and then

1239
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:52,160
let's raise something

1240
02:04:52,160 --> 02:05:01,160
in your body

1241
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:03,160
aw man

1242
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:08,160
aw man

1243
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:12,160
he meal as those he meets a single question

1244
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:16,160
and kills them using his drill

1245
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:21,160
that might that might be none other than the figure you saw on the show

1246
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:24,160
however I have no proof

1247
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:30,160
there are holes

1248
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:41,160
there are holes in this house

1249
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:43,160
then we'll have to gather evidence

1250
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:45,160
let's get ourselves to the forest

1251
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:50,160
investigation requires legwork

1252
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:52,160
there's no hesitation in mashita

1253
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:59,160
after facing hanahiko he knows full well what spirits are capable of

1254
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:03,160
is this his training and experience as a police detective

1255
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:08,160
ain't now you silly yes silly yes

1256
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:16,160
going there in the middle of the night you guys are totally lost

1257
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:21,160
you scared

1258
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:24,160
what do you say I ain't no scaredy cat

1259
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:27,160
hey old man take me with you instead of him

1260
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:29,160
if that huge guy really is some monster

1261
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:35,160
I bound him to dust

1262
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:42,160
he's easy to manipulate

1263
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:44,160
you've set out on a destination

1264
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:46,160
you've head to the forest by each castle

1265
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:48,160
once you're ready

1266
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:52,160
your first goal is to identify the spirit that bestowed the mark

1267
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:58,160
best wishes for your investigation

1268
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:00,160
new info was added to the spirit file

1269
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:03,160
the forest and shimio

1270
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:05,160
new chapter item changes

1271
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:09,160
all items obtained within a chapter are removed at the end

1272
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:14,160
if a character brings an item it will start the edit at the start

1273
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:16,160
new chapter soul power

1274
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:19,160
oh we'll return to 1000

1275
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:23,160
shit okay what do we have

1276
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:27,160
shimio

1277
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:29,160
okay

1278
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,160
first round by a stranger fans suicides and body dumping

1279
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:33,160
and the likes are scared off their casual visitor

1280
02:07:33,160 --> 02:07:36,160
only the occasional test of courage brings a foolish kid inside

1281
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:38,160
the paths are shaded at all hours with the trees

1282
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:41,160
so it's easy to become lost amongst the rumors swirling

1283
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:43,160
about this forest is one of a bizarre man

1284
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:45,160
a spotted man shimio

1285
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:47,160
is covered in dark splotches asks

1286
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,160
he meets if they like bees

1287
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:53,160
if they say yes he attacks while laughing maniacally

1288
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:55,160
he sounds like you're standard crazy

1289
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:57,160
but I guess he's the next spirit will face

1290
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:59,160
at any rate we'll have to head to the forest to investigate

1291
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:01,160
the forest... okay

1292
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:03,160
we're good

1293
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:08,160
who are we gonna take

1294
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:11,160
the insulin punk or the ex detective

1295
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:14,160
senpai who should we take

1296
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:16,160
punk

1297
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,160
punk 100% okay

1298
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,160
punk leaves the way

1299
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:38,160
okay I guess we'll take him

1300
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:43,160
let's go

1301
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,160
let's go

1302
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:52,160
oh shit you're right I didn't save

1303
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:00,160
shit why am I

1304
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,160
dammit why

1305
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:08,160
she'll throw himself into the passenger seat

1306
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:10,160
and mumbles an endless

1307
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:12,160
litany of complaints

1308
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:14,160
I really want to tell him to shut up

1309
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:16,160
but I'm pretty sure that'll only make things work

1310
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:22,160
it's only natural for a guy his age

1311
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,160
hey old man you got smokes

1312
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:28,160
I blank in surprise

1313
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:30,160
it's a cigarette uh

1314
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,160
I instinctively put my hand in my pocket

1315
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:34,160
but then I come to my senses

1316
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:38,160
you're not old enough for that yet

1317
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:40,160
shut up I'm 19 already it's fine

1318
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:44,160
whoa you have your answer

1319
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:52,160
19 but you're still in high school

1320
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:54,160
now I've done it

1321
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:56,160
I've overcome with regret the instant I say it

1322
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:58,160
but I can't take it back now

1323
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:00,160
well it skills me for repeating the grade

1324
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:06,160
oh shit

1325
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:08,160
oh shit

1326
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:14,160
looks like I touched a sore subject

1327
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:16,160
even though it wasn't my intention

1328
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:20,160
oh no

1329
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:22,160
senpai how can you be so callous

1330
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:32,160
how can you be so callous

1331
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:34,160
senpai

1332
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:40,160
the atmosphere in the car was bad enough

1333
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:42,160
and now I made it worse

1334
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:46,160
it's okay

1335
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:48,160
it's okay to repeat grades

1336
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:52,160
I need to change the subject

1337
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:54,160
so are you in a club or anything

1338
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:02,160
how's this on us because

1339
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:04,160
this the main character is senpai darling

1340
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:06,160
remember

1341
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:08,160
you look pretty fit so maybe baseball

1342
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,160
or

1343
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:12,160
yeah I played

1344
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:14,160
but I quit

1345
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,160
my emergency just saved

1346
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,160
just swarmed into dangerous territory

1347
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:20,160
oops

1348
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,160
bulk bulk

1349
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:30,160
rock my knee

1350
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:32,160
too many laps

1351
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:34,160
coach kept saying I had bad attitudes

1352
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:36,160
look that I'm funny

1353
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:38,160
sorry

1354
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:40,160
why you apologize

1355
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,160
I don't care about that shit

1356
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:46,160
I couldn't really get into

1357
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:48,160
it under that shitty coach anyway

1358
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:52,160
I think I know now why he rides

1359
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:54,160
his motorcycle alone in the mountains

1360
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:00,160
but if he came to Kujo mansion after

1361
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:02,160
I set back like that

1362
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:04,160
ah fuck

1363
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:06,160
it's seriously frustrating

1364
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:10,160
keeps a string of swearing for a while

1365
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,160
anyone would act the same

1366
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:16,160
anyone would swear up a storm

1367
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:18,160
but keep going down the same path anyway

1368
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:20,160
down this dark uncertain road

1369
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:22,160
that only leads to death

1370
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:36,160
we arrive at the forest by H castle

1371
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:38,160
I stopped the car near where Shou said

1372
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:40,160
he saw the man and we entered the forest

1373
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:44,160
all the guideposts on the path surfaded

1374
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:46,160
their paints peeling off

1375
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:48,160
it looks hardly travest

1376
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:50,160
just as Shou and Mashita said

1377
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:54,160
call

1378
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:56,160
roll

1379
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:58,160
sue

1380
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:00,160
is that call

1381
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:02,160
did I read it right?

1382
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:06,160
I can't remember anymore

1383
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:12,160
why don't we walk

1384
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:14,160
a while

1385
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:16,160
we come by a large arc marking the start of hiking trail

1386
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:24,160
it's rested over and with the paint

1387
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:26,160
peeling it doesn't seem to have been

1388
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:28,160
it doesn't seem to have been touched up

1389
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:32,160
the letters have faded

1390
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,160
nor mostly

1391
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:36,160
illegible

1392
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:38,160
carefully reading it it says

1393
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:44,160
welcome to the M

1394
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:50,160
blush and romantic you are

1395
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:56,160
wood timberland murder

1396
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:02,160
murder

1397
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:04,160
murder huh

1398
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:06,160
coincidence that's all

1399
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:08,160
it's just because it's way

1400
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:10,160
old and faded

1401
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:12,160
come on old man let's go already

1402
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:16,160
we pass through the arc

1403
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:18,160
and enter the forest

1404
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:24,160
well let's look around first

1405
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:28,160
I don't think I've been

1406
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:30,160
it's been used in a long time there's no garbage littered

1407
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:32,160
either

1408
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:34,160
I feel around inside the container

1409
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:36,160
but nothing's inside

1410
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:38,160
dang it

1411
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:42,160
the weather beaten

1412
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:44,160
table and benches are clearly damaged

1413
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:46,160
and rotting in places

1414
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:48,160
feel I peek underneath the table

1415
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:50,160
and find something stuck there

1416
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:52,160
I found a worn out talisman

1417
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:54,160
when I pick up the worn out talisman

1418
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:56,160
I feel warm throw

1419
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:58,160
me yes

1420
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:00,160
I got soul power

1421
02:15:06,160 --> 02:15:08,160
the sworn out talisman crumbles silently

1422
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:10,160
in my hand

1423
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:14,160
I feel like I should go back

1424
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:16,160
and like save

1425
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:20,160
I'm gonna go back and save

1426
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:22,160
I'm gonna go back and save

1427
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:24,160
yeah

1428
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:26,160
let's save first

1429
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,160
actually let's do

1430
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:34,160
no yes no yes

1431
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:36,160
let's save here it's a new chapter

1432
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:40,160
ouch

1433
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:42,160
get myself

1434
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:44,160
this game has time limits

1435
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:46,160
or no

1436
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:48,160
no

1437
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:50,160
no

1438
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:52,160
well they have quick time events

1439
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:56,160
right

1440
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:04,160
okay we're back there again

1441
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:10,160
it reads welcome to the lush and romantic

1442
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:12,160
wood timberland

1443
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:18,160
let's move forward

1444
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,160
can you down the path a short while

1445
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:24,160
before we come across something unexpected

1446
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:26,160
the grave marker was probably put there

1447
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:28,160
to honor those who commit suicide here

1448
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,160
might not be a bad idea to say a quick prayer

1449
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,160
for those who ended their suffering melee

1450
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,160
look something's written in magic marker

1451
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:44,160
say the opposite of the truth

1452
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:46,160
you'll be followed

1453
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:50,160
so scowled to cover how his face

1454
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,160
is definitely pale

1455
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:56,160
you'll be followed the hells with that

1456
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:58,160
dammit whose scribbles dumbass graffiti

1457
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,160
um

1458
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:06,160
I guess

1459
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:12,160
when it says

1460
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:14,160
I mean we have to lie

1461
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:18,160
just off to the side

1462
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:20,160
I noticed a faint trail

1463
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:22,160
discovered entrance to the beast

1464
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,160
to the beast trail

1465
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,160
look there's a path over there too

1466
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:30,160
ailment try to keep up

1467
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,160
what the fuck did we go

1468
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:36,160
you

1469
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:40,160
lying officially allowed

1470
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:42,160
first see who would

1471
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,160
you say is the

1472
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:46,160
the most facile

1473
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:48,160
probably me

1474
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:52,160
probably me

1475
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,160
because sometimes

1476
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:58,160
I don't understand a lot of innuendos

1477
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:06,160
between azura and mercy

1478
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,160
I think

1479
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:10,160
it's probably still me

1480
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:14,160
it's probably still me

1481
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:16,160
it's because

1482
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:18,160
it's probably still me because I don't get

1483
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:20,160
a lot of innuendos

1484
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:24,160
I don't know shibby's been saying you have a lot of hidden powers

1485
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:26,160
what the heck has shibby been saying to you

1486
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:30,160
I mean I guess

1487
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:32,160
I guess

1488
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:36,160
in a way

1489
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:48,160
I have potential

1490
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:54,160
better yet

1491
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,160
I have potential

1492
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:58,160
is that a better way to say it

1493
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:02,160
I

1494
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:04,160
I

1495
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:06,160
I

1496
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:08,160
I

1497
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:10,160
I

1498
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:12,160
I

1499
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:14,160
I

1500
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,160
I

1501
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:18,160
I

1502
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:20,160
I

1503
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,160
I

1504
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:24,160
I

1505
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:26,160
I

1506
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:28,160
I

1507
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:51,560
probably and second most second most unhinged or like most most not say so

1508
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:58,600
would be it's a toss-up between I see and she be

1509
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:09,520
like I remember you saying what's a countdown do I say the number it's kind

1510
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:14,580
of embarrassing sometimes I'm like I don't know what this means and then I go

1511
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:23,100
someone and they like I can feel the literal the literal like face palm as

1512
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:39,260
they're typing to me you know and then I go okay yeah it's some okay okay I okay

1513
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:43,700
it's something like that then it's something like that then

1514
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:59,540
it's okay it's okay I'll learn

1515
02:20:59,540 --> 02:21:13,020
it's Johnny literally said she's the most say so I don't think Johnny is the

1516
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:20,860
most say so I don't think strong is the most say so let's just say that I don't

1517
02:21:20,860 --> 02:21:25,740
think strong is the most say so because sometimes while we're together she says

1518
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:29,660
the most unhinged just things and I just go

1519
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:52,020
she just says things and I go okay the moonlight doesn't reach the beast trail

1520
02:21:52,500 --> 02:22:00,180
the branches off the hiking trail so we're in gloom gloom the trees are thick

1521
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:10,620
on both sides and I think her favorite thing she likes to tell me is like I'm

both sides we'd get lost if I didn't have a flashlight just then fuck off

1524
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:44,340
there are footsteps close by from the bushes hold on did you hear footsteps

1526
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:59,700

thank you for the super chat for two shut the fuck up hear that voice again I

1557
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:18,660
think that would just make him more angry

1558
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:24,740
stop it does that mean I should dissuade him

1559
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:32,380

1576
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:39,980
flattery

1577
02:29:46,660 --> 02:29:53,380

1658
02:54:19,460 --> 02:54:28,700
around nervously and he mutters quietly could it be that creepy guy he checks

1659
02:54:28,700 --> 02:54:35,940
around on full alert satisfied that no one's there he resumes speaking okay

1660
02:54:38,780 --> 02:54:44,900

okay we give him tough love

1663
02:55:02,700 --> 02:55:10,740
why do I have to make her happy when it caused me such pain ridiculous done with

1673
02:56:29,740 --> 02:56:34,620
rethink it honestly though you look like you'll be fine the expression changes

1674
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:38,620

1694
02:59:11,740 --> 02:59:16,420
feel this did I feel it there's the gray marker but nothing's unusual about it

1695
02:59:16,420 --> 02:59:23,380
other than the graffiti anything else around here

1696
02:59:29,380 --> 02:59:36,220
okay Jesus Jesus

1697
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:52,700
there was a light there wasn't there I go to open the door and my hands get

1698
02:59:52,700 --> 03:00:02,220
coated with a sticky liquid

1699
03:00:02,220 --> 03:00:15,500
I smell sweet is it honey

1700
03:00:22,700 --> 03:00:25,260
Why would there be honey on a doorknob?

1701
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:27,180
Mystified, I step inside the cottage.

1702
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:34,900
I sure hope as fuck there's nothing here.

1703
03:00:37,820 --> 03:00:39,180
How about that, it's clean.

1704
03:00:39,180 --> 03:00:40,780
How about that, it's clean.

1705
03:00:43,460 --> 03:00:45,260
It's been a night here, easy.

1706
03:00:52,700 --> 03:01:02,620
I don't like the look of that, that, that bag.

1707
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:06,860
Ignore shows rambling and take a good look around the cottage.

1708
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:11,260
Not sure why, but something feels off.

1709
03:01:11,260 --> 03:01:14,260
It takes me two seconds to figure it out.

1710
03:01:15,220 --> 03:01:16,180
It's too clean.

1711
03:01:26,340 --> 03:01:29,300
Huh, show looks at me startled.

1712
03:01:30,740 --> 03:01:31,780
Don't you think it's strange?

1713
03:01:32,740 --> 03:01:36,500
Why would a building that's been abandoned for so long get this clean inside?

1714
03:01:36,900 --> 03:01:38,900
Oh.

1715
03:01:49,700 --> 03:01:53,220
I don't even have to look to know his face just turned three shades whiter.

1716
03:01:54,820 --> 03:01:56,820
Saying someone lives here?

1717
03:01:59,300 --> 03:02:02,740
I don't know for sure, but it's possible someone comes here occasionally.

1718
03:02:03,620 --> 03:02:11,300
That or I immediately start shining my flashlight on places of interest.

1719
03:02:20,900 --> 03:02:22,740
Maybe I should have brought the cough instead.

1720
03:02:27,860 --> 03:02:29,060
What do you think's in this bag?

1721
03:02:29,860 --> 03:02:30,340
Pretty big.

1722
03:02:31,220 --> 03:02:32,820
How should I know?

1723
03:02:32,820 --> 03:02:35,940
If you're so interested in it, why don't you open it already?

1724
03:02:37,860 --> 03:02:41,540
She'll give me the go-ahead, so I open the burlap sack.

1725
03:02:44,820 --> 03:02:48,500
Before I can stop it, it loses its balance and topples it to the floor.

1726
03:02:49,300 --> 03:02:50,980
She'll's eyes open wide again.

1727
03:02:50,980 --> 03:02:52,500
Just a gasp.

1728
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:56,500
Ugh.

1729
03:02:56,660 --> 03:02:57,460
Senpai!

1730
03:02:58,500 --> 03:02:59,300
Not again!

1731
03:03:01,220 --> 03:03:02,660
Senpai not done!

1732
03:03:09,540 --> 03:03:10,420
Hold on.

1733
03:03:10,420 --> 03:03:10,980
Hold on.

1734
03:03:10,980 --> 03:03:11,940
Senpai, don't look.

1735
03:03:12,820 --> 03:03:13,780
Senpai, don't look.

1736
03:03:15,140 --> 03:03:16,100
Senpai, don't look.

1737
03:03:16,100 --> 03:03:16,740
Don't look.

1738
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:17,860
Don't look, Senpai.

1739
03:03:18,580 --> 03:03:19,860
Senpai, don't look.

1740
03:03:19,860 --> 03:03:22,420
I don't even know where to cover first.

1741
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:23,540
There, there.

1742
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:34,020
YouTube, YouTube, this is fine.

1743
03:03:48,420 --> 03:03:56,180
While it rolls onto the floor, it's a corpse.

1744
03:04:03,220 --> 03:04:03,780
A woman.

1745
03:04:08,900 --> 03:04:10,260
What's with that body?

1746
03:04:11,460 --> 03:04:14,020
The body is drilled with countless holes.

1747
03:04:18,660 --> 03:04:25,620
A sharp cylindrical tool must have gouged them.

1748
03:04:29,060 --> 03:04:31,780
Please, please, please don't tell on me, Senpai.

1749
03:04:34,660 --> 03:04:38,100
Even otter, her whole body appears to be covered in liquid.

1750
03:04:40,180 --> 03:04:43,620
Why did, why did you have to say it like that?

1751
03:04:48,660 --> 03:04:55,860
A thick sweet scent fills the air, strong enough to make you want to cough.

1752
03:04:58,980 --> 03:05:00,180
Is this honey?

1753
03:05:06,100 --> 03:05:06,500
Honey?

1754
03:05:08,900 --> 03:05:10,340
Stop looking, Senpai!

1755
03:05:15,140 --> 03:05:16,180
On a corpse?

1756
03:05:16,180 --> 03:05:16,580
Why?

1757
03:05:18,820 --> 03:05:19,380
Why?

1758
03:05:22,500 --> 03:05:24,660
He's not really asking me, obviously.

1759
03:05:24,660 --> 03:05:25,940
There's no way I'd know.

1760
03:05:25,940 --> 03:05:27,540
Should I've gotten a cough instead?

1761
03:05:27,540 --> 03:05:30,980
He would handle this much better than a teenager,

1762
03:05:30,980 --> 03:05:32,820
more technically still in his teens.

1763
03:05:32,820 --> 03:05:33,540
One more year.

1764
03:05:38,740 --> 03:05:40,420
I don't like holes either, so.

1765
03:05:42,340 --> 03:05:42,660
Cool.

1766
03:05:44,820 --> 03:05:47,780
All I do know is we need to get out of here.

1767
03:05:47,860 --> 03:05:48,900
As soon as possible.

1768
03:05:50,740 --> 03:05:52,420
Let's hurry and search the rest of the cottage.

1769
03:05:54,660 --> 03:05:55,140
What?

1770
03:05:55,140 --> 03:05:56,260
You're gonna look around?

1771
03:06:07,460 --> 03:06:08,900
What, what are we gonna do about this?

1772
03:06:09,940 --> 03:06:11,700
He's not expecting us to take it, is he?

1773
03:06:12,980 --> 03:06:14,100
Close the bag, put it back.

1774
03:06:14,660 --> 03:06:15,380
That's all we can do.

1775
03:06:15,380 --> 03:06:16,500
Come on, help me out.

1776
03:06:18,420 --> 03:06:21,940
Hey, this isn't the time to be freaking out.

1777
03:06:21,940 --> 03:06:23,140
Actually, yes it is.

1778
03:06:24,020 --> 03:06:25,060
Cool, it's freaked out.

1779
03:06:33,460 --> 03:06:35,700
Sweating profusely, we managed to get the job done.

1780
03:06:37,060 --> 03:06:39,140
Okay, that was, that was pretty disturbing.

1781
03:06:39,140 --> 03:06:39,780
Not gonna lie.

1782
03:06:39,780 --> 03:06:41,620
Yeah, actually, that was pretty, you know.

1783
03:06:43,300 --> 03:06:43,780
That was...

1784
03:06:45,060 --> 03:06:46,340
Holes are rough?

1785
03:06:46,340 --> 03:06:48,340
I told you, Senpai, I hate holes!

1786
03:06:56,580 --> 03:06:58,500
I still need to search the rest of the cottage.

1787
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:01,780
New info was added in the spirit file.

1788
03:07:01,780 --> 03:07:02,820
Carps in the cottage.

1789
03:07:04,980 --> 03:07:06,820
What, what was it, trypophobia or something?

1790
03:07:06,820 --> 03:07:08,420
Yeah, I have trypophobia.

1791
03:07:09,140 --> 03:07:09,860
I hate it.

1792
03:07:09,860 --> 03:07:10,980
I hate it so much.

1793
03:07:17,140 --> 03:07:20,660
Okay, what are these books?

1794
03:07:22,180 --> 03:07:22,500
Look.

1795
03:07:23,620 --> 03:07:25,300
Honeybees are our friends.

1796
03:07:25,300 --> 03:07:29,300
Make them ammoable with medicine from the sprayer.

1797
03:07:30,260 --> 03:07:30,980
They get mad.

1798
03:07:30,980 --> 03:07:33,380
Pay attention to the direction the hive is facing.

1799
03:07:34,020 --> 03:07:35,140
Awaken to honeybees.

1800
03:07:35,140 --> 03:07:37,220
Leave the hive in the direction of the sun.

1801
03:07:39,700 --> 03:07:40,100
Go.

1802
03:07:41,140 --> 03:07:42,260
Honeybees are our friends.

1803
03:07:43,060 --> 03:07:43,380
No.

1804
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:51,060
It looks like something useful.

1805
03:07:51,060 --> 03:07:51,460
Information.

1806
03:07:51,460 --> 03:07:52,740
Should I rip it out and take it with me?

1807
03:07:56,020 --> 03:07:56,740
Burrow the page.

1808
03:08:04,420 --> 03:08:07,220
Make hive, new body, smear honey all over.

1809
03:08:07,220 --> 03:08:10,900
Ferment, honey gets stinky, stinky liquid!

1810
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:19,780
Thank you for the tip and on.

1811
03:08:19,780 --> 03:08:20,580
Thank you, Mercy.

1812
03:08:22,420 --> 03:08:24,340
Oh, and sorry, I missed the super chat.

1813
03:08:24,340 --> 03:08:26,020
Thank you for the $2 super chat, boy.

1814
03:08:26,900 --> 03:08:29,060
And welcome to being in my merryuki.

1815
03:08:32,900 --> 03:08:33,780
Stinky, huh?

1816
03:08:35,300 --> 03:08:38,500
Gone by smell, honey bee enter hive.

1817
03:08:39,460 --> 03:08:40,740
Looks like some useful information.

1818
03:08:40,740 --> 03:08:42,340
Should I rip it out and take it with me?

1819
03:08:42,340 --> 03:08:42,580
Yeah.

1820
03:08:44,580 --> 03:08:45,780
I'm going to need to remember that.

1821
03:08:47,060 --> 03:08:50,980
A bottle of drugs is all in line.

1822
03:08:50,980 --> 03:08:52,900
Look, the labels say night night.

1823
03:08:53,460 --> 03:08:54,740
Also, the bottles are empty.

1824
03:08:56,500 --> 03:08:59,300
I shake each one and luckily find one that still has some left inside.

1825
03:09:00,180 --> 03:09:00,820
But night night.

1826
03:09:03,700 --> 03:09:06,340
I remove the lid and look inside, but all I find is dust.

1827
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:07,220
Okay, useless.

1828
03:09:10,900 --> 03:09:11,860
Meadow to a box.

1829
03:09:13,140 --> 03:09:13,620
Locked.

1830
03:09:13,620 --> 03:09:14,500
There's no way to open it.

1831
03:09:17,300 --> 03:09:18,500
Can I feel it?

1832
03:09:21,700 --> 03:09:23,460
There's thin layer of dust built on the outside.

1833
03:09:23,460 --> 03:09:24,820
No one has touched it for a long time.

1834
03:09:26,820 --> 03:09:27,540
I love this one.

1835
03:09:28,980 --> 03:09:31,860
Peek through the cracks to see if anything's inside, but seems to be empty.

1836
03:09:39,060 --> 03:09:39,780
Anything else?

1837
03:09:40,180 --> 03:09:45,060
I flip the switch at the base of the light bulb, but it doesn't turn on.

1838
03:09:45,060 --> 03:09:45,780
Maybe it's broken.

1839
03:09:50,180 --> 03:09:52,020
Can we get this later, Senpai?

1840
03:09:56,260 --> 03:09:57,700
Do you think we're done, Senpai?

1841
03:10:10,020 --> 03:10:10,980
Save just in case?

1842
03:10:10,980 --> 03:10:12,340
I don't think I can save here.

1843
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:18,900
Boxes in the corner of this one?

1844
03:10:18,900 --> 03:10:20,900
Oh, they said there was nothing but dust inside.

1845
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:32,900
Open the door and let the cabin.

1846
03:10:40,580 --> 03:10:41,060
Okay.

1847
03:10:47,060 --> 03:10:48,340
We're going to save scum again.

1848
03:10:53,460 --> 03:10:57,860
We're going to save scum again because I think we can only save at Kujo Mansion?

1849
03:10:57,860 --> 03:10:59,060
I don't actually remember.

1850
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:18,980
Okay, well, we haven't taken this trail yet.

1851
03:11:22,820 --> 03:11:24,020
Shut the fuck up!

1852
03:11:26,740 --> 03:11:27,140
Sorry.

1853
03:11:28,900 --> 03:11:33,140
As we continue through the dense forest, the pain cries suddenly echoes amongst the trees.

1854
03:11:34,660 --> 03:11:35,380
Do I have to?

1855
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:37,220
Nice hand.

1856
03:11:40,020 --> 03:11:41,300
There's a pattern on the tree trunk.

1857
03:11:42,260 --> 03:11:43,860
It's an arm-like pattern on the bark.

1858
03:11:43,860 --> 03:11:45,380
Is this even a natural occurrence?

1859
03:11:47,140 --> 03:11:51,540
Look around the tree and find a talisman on the exact opposite side of the tree from the pattern.

1860
03:11:52,340 --> 03:11:53,780
Yes! A worn-out talisman!

1861
03:11:53,780 --> 03:11:54,260
We did it!

1862
03:12:00,820 --> 03:12:04,020
When I pick up the worn-out talisman, I feel warmth flow through me.

1863
03:12:04,020 --> 03:12:05,540
Give me back my stuff!

1864
03:12:05,540 --> 03:12:06,500
Thank you!

1865
03:12:06,580 --> 03:12:07,620
Got soul power.

1866
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:09,860
Or now a talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

1867
03:12:14,980 --> 03:12:15,620
Anything else?

1868
03:12:17,940 --> 03:12:18,660
Move forward.

1869
03:12:26,580 --> 03:12:27,460
I don't see anything.

1870
03:12:28,980 --> 03:12:29,940
Keep moving forward.

1871
03:12:32,420 --> 03:12:33,620
Wait, is this another one?

1872
03:12:37,220 --> 03:12:40,740
Look, something's written in Sanskrit.

1873
03:12:40,740 --> 03:12:41,700
But the letters are blurry.

1874
03:12:41,700 --> 03:12:42,740
It just looks like a stain.

1875
03:12:44,260 --> 03:12:45,860
Off to the side, I notice a thin trail.

1876
03:12:47,460 --> 03:12:48,420
Down the beast trail.

1877
03:12:49,620 --> 03:12:50,180
Thought so.

1878
03:12:50,180 --> 03:12:51,300
There's one here too.

1879
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:52,660
Come on, let's go.

1880
03:12:54,340 --> 03:12:55,700
Follow Sho into the bushes.

1881
03:12:58,660 --> 03:12:59,300
Ugh!

1882
03:12:59,300 --> 03:13:00,020
Not you again!

1883
03:13:02,260 --> 03:13:03,540
Sho spots something.

1884
03:13:03,620 --> 03:13:06,660
Something instumbles, calling backwards onto me.

1885
03:13:06,660 --> 03:13:09,140
At the same time, every single hair on my body stands on end.

1886
03:13:14,660 --> 03:13:15,060
Hi!

1887
03:13:22,180 --> 03:13:25,460
I quickly look down and find a guy!

1888
03:13:27,060 --> 03:13:28,900
Something is clinging onto my ankle.

1889
03:13:28,900 --> 03:13:30,420
It's expression anguished.

1890
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:33,780
Is this where we tell the opposite?

1891
03:13:33,780 --> 03:13:34,900
Is this where we lie?

1892
03:13:36,340 --> 03:13:38,260
It seems eager to speak for me,

1893
03:13:38,260 --> 03:13:40,900
but his voice is incredibly hard to decipher.

1894
03:13:45,940 --> 03:13:50,820
This place pitch black.

1895
03:13:53,860 --> 03:13:55,540
Something can't see anything.

1896
03:14:01,140 --> 03:14:02,260
I can't see what he is.

1897
03:14:02,260 --> 03:14:03,300
I don't know what the last one is.

1898
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:03,780
What do you think?

1899
03:14:04,500 --> 03:14:07,300
What do you think that the third word is?

1900
03:14:07,300 --> 03:14:09,140
The third thingy?

1901
03:14:14,580 --> 03:14:15,700
What's it saying?

1902
03:14:16,500 --> 03:14:16,900
Goon?

1903
03:14:19,460 --> 03:14:20,340
Goon, goon.

1904
03:14:20,340 --> 03:14:21,540
Okay, okay.

1905
03:14:21,540 --> 03:14:22,100
Goon.

1906
03:14:30,100 --> 03:14:31,380
Wait, that grade marker said,

1907
03:14:31,380 --> 03:14:32,420
say the opposite of the truth.

1908
03:14:32,420 --> 03:14:33,460
Okay, okay, okay, we're good.

1909
03:14:35,220 --> 03:14:36,580
But what's the opposite of the truth?

1910
03:14:36,580 --> 03:14:38,420
Does that mean I'm supposed to lie?

1911
03:14:38,420 --> 03:14:38,820
Yeah.

1912
03:14:41,140 --> 03:14:43,220
Live or die.

1913
03:14:45,700 --> 03:14:46,260
Again, okay.

1914
03:14:47,140 --> 03:14:47,940
Hey, wait.

1915
03:14:48,820 --> 03:14:49,220
Are you?

1916
03:14:51,620 --> 03:14:52,660
Lifeless too?

1917
03:14:57,140 --> 03:14:57,780
What does that mean?

1918
03:15:01,380 --> 03:15:03,140
No, no, no, I'm not, right?

1919
03:15:04,180 --> 03:15:06,020
Oh, wait, yes, we are li-

1920
03:15:06,020 --> 03:15:07,300
Yes, we are lifeless.

1921
03:15:07,300 --> 03:15:09,140
Yes, we lie.

1922
03:15:09,140 --> 03:15:09,460
Yes.

1923
03:15:15,700 --> 03:15:16,180
I am.

1924
03:15:22,500 --> 03:15:24,100
It looks sad and lonely.

1925
03:15:27,060 --> 03:15:27,300
I-

1926
03:15:29,620 --> 03:15:30,100
Right.

1927
03:15:30,100 --> 03:15:30,820
Okay, right?

1928
03:15:30,820 --> 03:15:32,260
Only the dead are here.

1929
03:15:38,580 --> 03:15:39,060
Safe.

1930
03:15:39,060 --> 03:15:41,380
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1931
03:15:42,020 --> 03:15:42,740
Quick.

1932
03:15:42,740 --> 03:15:44,420
I hear another voice at my feet.

1933
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:46,820
M-

1934
03:15:48,020 --> 03:15:49,780
M-M-M-I, dead.

1935
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:51,060
No, no, you're not dead.

1936
03:15:51,940 --> 03:15:52,340
Right?

1937
03:15:52,340 --> 03:15:55,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, you're not.

1938
03:15:55,220 --> 03:15:55,940
No, no.

1939
03:15:58,100 --> 03:15:58,420
Oh.

1940
03:16:02,260 --> 03:16:02,500
Don't-

1941
03:16:03,780 --> 03:16:05,300
I don't believe it.

1942
03:16:05,300 --> 03:16:06,180
I don't understand.

1943
03:16:08,740 --> 03:16:09,540
Am I?

1944
03:16:09,540 --> 03:16:10,340
Okay, am I?

1945
03:16:12,340 --> 03:16:12,820
What?

1946
03:16:12,820 --> 03:16:13,700
You dead?

1947
03:16:13,700 --> 03:16:14,740
No, no.

1948
03:16:15,700 --> 03:16:16,260
Tell me.

1949
03:16:16,820 --> 03:16:17,940
Are you dead?

1950
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:18,740
Am I dead?

1951
03:16:18,740 --> 03:16:19,060
No.

1952
03:16:19,860 --> 03:16:20,660
No.

1953
03:16:20,660 --> 03:16:22,660
No, no.

1954
03:16:26,180 --> 03:16:27,060
Deny it.

1955
03:16:27,060 --> 03:16:27,620
Yeah.

1956
03:16:27,620 --> 03:16:29,060
No, no, you?

1957
03:16:29,060 --> 03:16:29,460
No.

1958
03:16:29,460 --> 03:16:30,340
Look at you.

1959
03:16:30,340 --> 03:16:32,900
Look at your pink skin and the soft-

1960
03:16:34,020 --> 03:16:35,380
soft flushes of your-

1961
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:38,020
your- your cheeks.

1962
03:16:38,020 --> 03:16:38,820
Yeah.

1963
03:16:38,820 --> 03:16:39,460
Look at you.

1964
03:16:39,460 --> 03:16:41,460
So much life in your eyes.

1965
03:16:47,940 --> 03:16:48,500
No, wait.

1966
03:16:48,500 --> 03:16:52,020
I still have to suffer- suffer.

1967
03:16:54,020 --> 03:16:55,460
Along with your complexion.

1968
03:16:59,140 --> 03:17:00,500
It looks sad and lonely.

1969
03:17:02,100 --> 03:17:02,820
Okay, okay.

1970
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:03,860
Another lie.

1971
03:17:03,860 --> 03:17:04,500
Another lie.

1972
03:17:06,260 --> 03:17:08,020
I hear yet another voice at my feet.

1973
03:17:11,700 --> 03:17:13,460
Someone, please listen.

1974
03:17:13,460 --> 03:17:21,940
I want to live.

1975
03:17:22,500 --> 03:17:23,540
I want to live.

1976
03:17:23,540 --> 03:17:25,060
I want to live.

1977
03:17:25,060 --> 03:17:25,780
Okay.

1978
03:17:25,780 --> 03:17:27,060
Or is it I want to love?

1979
03:17:28,740 --> 03:17:30,260
Like, 75s love me, right?

1980
03:17:36,900 --> 03:17:38,500
I- I'm-

1981
03:17:40,740 --> 03:17:41,620
I'm alive.

1982
03:17:42,420 --> 03:17:42,820
Wait.

1983
03:17:43,700 --> 03:17:45,620
Senpai's help.

1984
03:17:45,620 --> 03:17:47,460
Do I say, yep, you are alive.

1985
03:17:47,460 --> 03:17:48,340
Yep, you are.

1986
03:17:51,700 --> 03:17:52,820
Do I say that?

1987
03:17:52,820 --> 03:17:53,620
Do I say that?

1988
03:17:53,620 --> 03:17:55,620
Or do I say the opposite of what they're saying?

1989
03:17:56,340 --> 03:17:56,740
No, wait.

1990
03:17:56,740 --> 03:17:57,540
I lie, right?

1991
03:17:58,740 --> 03:17:59,700
Yep, you sir.

1992
03:17:59,700 --> 03:18:00,500
You sure are.

1993
03:18:02,580 --> 03:18:03,380
We need to lie.

1994
03:18:03,380 --> 03:18:04,260
Yeah, we need to lie.

1995
03:18:04,260 --> 03:18:06,500
So therefore, we got to go like, oh, yeah.

1996
03:18:06,500 --> 03:18:08,180
Yeah, you are so alive.

1997
03:18:14,420 --> 03:18:17,140
Uh, step on the ghost.

1998
03:18:17,140 --> 03:18:17,700
Not.

1999
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:19,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're alive.

2000
03:18:19,220 --> 03:18:19,700
You're alive.

2001
03:18:21,620 --> 03:18:22,100
That's right.

2002
03:18:22,100 --> 03:18:22,900
I'm alive.

2003
03:18:22,900 --> 03:18:23,620
I'm alive.

2004
03:18:24,340 --> 03:18:26,260
The voice sounds like it passes through me

2005
03:18:26,260 --> 03:18:27,780
and sucked into the ground.

2006
03:18:30,740 --> 03:18:31,300
Safe.

2007
03:18:31,300 --> 03:18:31,620
Woo!

2008
03:18:36,260 --> 03:18:37,380
The stuff ending.

2009
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:40,980
Next thing I know, the shadow clutching at my ankle is gone.

2010
03:18:42,020 --> 03:18:42,820
Survive.

2011
03:18:42,820 --> 03:18:44,180
Whoa, we did it, Senpai.

2012
03:18:49,460 --> 03:18:51,620
Show stands there, his face deathly pale.

2013
03:18:53,540 --> 03:18:54,340
No way.

2014
03:18:54,340 --> 03:18:55,300
I saw it.

2015
03:18:55,300 --> 03:18:56,900
God, it was so clear.

2016
03:18:59,300 --> 03:19:00,020
It's OK.

2017
03:19:00,020 --> 03:19:00,660
It's over now.

2018
03:19:01,940 --> 03:19:02,260
Right.

2019
03:19:04,500 --> 03:19:05,060
Oh, man.

2020
03:19:06,260 --> 03:19:06,740
Oh, what?

2021
03:19:07,860 --> 03:19:08,580
You're awesome.

2022
03:19:13,620 --> 03:19:19,940
Are we bonding after you said that guy needed to die?

2023
03:19:23,380 --> 03:19:24,980
Well, he's certainly straightforward.

2024
03:19:27,860 --> 03:19:28,900
Sure, let's go.

2025
03:19:31,380 --> 03:19:31,780
Yeah.

2026
03:19:36,980 --> 03:19:38,820
Is there anything at the end of this footpath?

2027
03:19:39,540 --> 03:19:40,180
What the hell is this?

2028
03:19:43,780 --> 03:19:48,980
Look, carefully approach it, but I don't see any bees.

2029
03:19:50,660 --> 03:19:52,980
Open the box and find a metal tool inside.

2030
03:19:53,860 --> 03:19:54,580
Got crowbar.

2031
03:19:56,420 --> 03:19:57,700
Oh, what's this doing here?

2032
03:19:58,420 --> 03:19:59,140
Why not grab it?

2033
03:20:02,820 --> 03:20:04,020
I don't think there's anything else.

2034
03:20:05,620 --> 03:20:06,980
Guess we go through the thing.

2035
03:20:06,980 --> 03:20:13,140
Step into the empty clearing.

2036
03:20:15,140 --> 03:20:17,220
The air is filled with buzzing of bees.

2037
03:20:19,380 --> 03:20:21,700
There appears to be a giant beehive there.

2038
03:20:23,620 --> 03:20:26,820
This probably wouldn't be right to keep going without doing something about them first.

2039
03:20:28,580 --> 03:20:30,260
These things are dangerous.

2040
03:20:30,820 --> 03:20:31,460
Dangerous.

2041
03:20:32,500 --> 03:20:33,060
Dangerous.

2042
03:20:37,220 --> 03:20:41,460
Oh, man, don't push your luck.

2043
03:20:42,260 --> 03:20:43,060
Don't push your luck.

2044
03:20:44,740 --> 03:20:46,020
You beat a hasty retreat.

2045
03:20:47,300 --> 03:20:47,700
Shit.

2046
03:20:48,660 --> 03:20:54,740
OK, so what now?

2047
03:20:59,780 --> 03:21:01,060
What's the bee note say again?

2048
03:21:02,420 --> 03:21:05,220
They said, but we need like a spray thingy.

2049
03:21:06,100 --> 03:21:06,580
Hold on.

2050
03:21:06,580 --> 03:21:07,860
Let me look at my memos.

2051
03:21:16,500 --> 03:21:17,940
Oh, Azura.

2052
03:21:19,380 --> 03:21:20,820
Welcome in Raiders.

2053
03:21:21,620 --> 03:21:23,460
Welcome, Azura.

2054
03:21:23,460 --> 03:21:24,340
Welcome to the stream.

2055
03:21:24,340 --> 03:21:25,060
Hello, Raiders.

2056
03:21:25,060 --> 03:21:26,420
How was one shot?

2057
03:21:26,420 --> 03:21:27,300
Did you finish?

2058
03:21:29,060 --> 03:21:30,340
Azura.

2059
03:21:30,340 --> 03:21:31,620
Azura.

2060
03:21:31,620 --> 03:21:32,420
Azura.

2061
03:21:32,980 --> 03:21:36,420
Azura, did you finish one shot?

2062
03:21:38,260 --> 03:21:39,220
Welcome, Raiders.

2063
03:21:39,220 --> 03:21:40,820
Welcome to the stream.

2064
03:21:43,620 --> 03:21:44,420
You already know me.

2065
03:21:44,420 --> 03:21:45,620
I'm Mercy Modiste.

2066
03:21:50,820 --> 03:21:53,940
I've arrived and no, it was much longer than I thought.

2067
03:21:53,940 --> 03:21:54,580
Oh, OK.

2068
03:21:54,580 --> 03:21:55,700
Well, you have another stream.

2069
03:21:55,700 --> 03:21:56,180
Don't worry.

2070
03:21:56,820 --> 03:21:57,860
Welcome, everyone.

2071
03:21:57,860 --> 03:22:00,740
Today we are playing a game called Deathmark.

2072
03:22:00,740 --> 03:22:04,900
It's like a visual novel with some quick time events.

2073
03:22:06,020 --> 03:22:06,260
Yeah.

2074
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:09,460
Yeah.

2075
03:22:09,460 --> 03:22:17,460
So yeah, it's a visual novel, horror visual novel.

2076
03:22:17,460 --> 03:22:17,700
Yeah.

2077
03:22:20,260 --> 03:22:21,060
What's in my bag?

2078
03:22:21,060 --> 03:22:21,460
Hold on.

2079
03:22:24,420 --> 03:22:26,980
OK, honey bees are friends.

2080
03:22:26,980 --> 03:22:29,300
Make them friendly with medicine from the sprayer.

2081
03:22:29,300 --> 03:22:32,580
If they get mad, pay attention to the direction the hive is facing.

2082
03:22:32,580 --> 03:22:33,700
Awaken honey bees.

2083
03:22:33,700 --> 03:22:35,300
Leave the hive in the direction of the sun.

2084
03:22:36,580 --> 03:22:38,020
Make hive new body smear.

2085
03:22:38,020 --> 03:22:38,900
Honey all over her.

2086
03:22:38,900 --> 03:22:40,580
My honey gets stinky like we draw my smile.

2087
03:22:40,580 --> 03:22:42,340
Honey, enter hive.

2088
03:22:42,340 --> 03:22:42,580
OK.

2089
03:22:43,300 --> 03:22:44,740
Can be used with a sprayer.

2090
03:22:44,740 --> 03:22:45,700
I don't have a sprayer.

2091
03:22:46,980 --> 03:22:48,260
The goat is going to head to bed.

2092
03:22:48,260 --> 03:22:49,860
I leave the bleeding hearts in your care.

2093
03:22:49,860 --> 03:22:50,820
Behave, everyone.

2094
03:22:50,820 --> 03:22:52,740
OK, thank you, Azura.

2095
03:22:52,740 --> 03:22:56,500
And if anyone else is tired, yeah.

2096
03:22:57,220 --> 03:23:03,300
Yeah, feel free to go to bed and just rest up.

2097
03:23:03,300 --> 03:23:04,180
Thank you.

2098
03:23:04,180 --> 03:23:05,940
Thank you, Azura, for bringing everyone in.

2099
03:23:11,620 --> 03:23:12,980
Yeah, behave.

2100
03:23:17,380 --> 03:23:18,500
Did I miss something?

2101
03:23:23,780 --> 03:23:24,260
Hold on.

2102
03:23:25,060 --> 03:23:27,220
Hold on every, every, every senpai.

2103
03:23:34,420 --> 03:23:36,260
We can't go to the side yet.

2104
03:23:36,260 --> 03:23:40,660
But I need a bee sprayer or anything.

2105
03:23:42,340 --> 03:23:44,100
Maybe I missed something at the cottage.

2106
03:23:50,500 --> 03:23:53,140
I think I missed something at the cottage senpai.

2107
03:23:54,820 --> 03:23:55,380
Probably.

2108
03:23:58,100 --> 03:23:59,060
Let's look around again.

2109
03:24:05,380 --> 03:24:06,500
Open the box with a crowbar.

2110
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:07,220
Oh, right.

2111
03:24:08,260 --> 03:24:09,860
Yes, you are right.

2112
03:24:09,860 --> 03:24:10,580
You are right.

2113
03:24:10,580 --> 03:24:12,340
We can probably open it with a crowbar.

2114
03:24:15,140 --> 03:24:15,860
Anything else?

2115
03:24:22,340 --> 03:24:22,980
Let's go in.

2116
03:24:24,660 --> 03:24:25,140
Let's go in.

2117
03:24:33,460 --> 03:24:34,020
Crowbar.

2118
03:24:35,700 --> 03:24:38,340
Take out the crowbar and shove it under the lid of the toolbox.

2119
03:24:38,340 --> 03:24:39,780
I put pressure on it.

2120
03:24:39,780 --> 03:24:40,660
Use it as a lever.

2121
03:24:42,020 --> 03:24:42,980
Throw a box prop.

2122
03:24:42,980 --> 03:24:43,780
It's open.

2123
03:24:43,780 --> 03:24:44,420
Got a sprayer.

2124
03:24:44,420 --> 03:24:44,900
We got it.

2125
03:24:45,460 --> 03:24:47,060
And I can use a variety of drugs.

2126
03:24:50,980 --> 03:24:54,180
Manipulators will themselves be manipulated.

2127
03:24:55,220 --> 03:24:56,020
What does this mean?

2128
03:25:00,820 --> 03:25:01,620
What's that thing?

2129
03:25:06,180 --> 03:25:08,980
The sun voice makes me jump but I shake it off and turns towards him.

2130
03:25:10,100 --> 03:25:12,260
It's a tool that sprays chemicals and pesticides.

2131
03:25:13,940 --> 03:25:17,220
You put the container of drugs in here and then do this.

2132
03:25:18,420 --> 03:25:19,860
I quickly demonstrate how it works.

2133
03:25:19,860 --> 03:25:23,460
Shoal scratches his head, his face, and his brow furls.

2134
03:25:24,660 --> 03:25:26,420
You sure know a lot, oh man.

2135
03:25:32,340 --> 03:25:34,260
I guess we don't manipulate a person?

2136
03:25:34,260 --> 03:25:35,380
No more lying, okay.

2137
03:25:40,500 --> 03:25:41,780
I'll let you handle it then.

2138
03:25:46,580 --> 03:25:48,260
Now I'm suddenly in charge of it.

2139
03:25:48,260 --> 03:25:53,620
Well, I want, when I want to spray a drug, I'll have to choose which drug to use.

2140
03:25:55,220 --> 03:25:58,260
But is this thing really that hard to figure out?

2141
03:25:58,260 --> 03:25:59,460
I've never seen it before either,

2142
03:25:59,460 --> 03:26:01,220
but I still know how to use it right away.

2143
03:26:02,340 --> 03:26:04,020
Uninfo was added to spirit pile.

2144
03:26:04,020 --> 03:26:04,900
Obtain sprayer.

2145
03:26:06,660 --> 03:26:09,700
Can I use, oh yeah, wait, this one has nothing in it.

2146
03:26:09,700 --> 03:26:12,180
Okay, yeah, yeah, Senpai smart.

2147
03:26:12,180 --> 03:26:13,940
Senpai smart, let's get the fuck out of there.

2148
03:26:20,420 --> 03:26:22,420
I don't think we're old, but I guess

2149
03:26:22,420 --> 03:26:30,580
according to Shoal, we're older than him, so I guess that's fine.

2150
03:26:30,580 --> 03:26:31,460
Okay, we're gonna,

2151
03:26:37,860 --> 03:26:39,060
we're gonna save scum.

2152
03:26:39,060 --> 03:26:41,780
Wait, am I not, wait, where am I?

2153
03:26:45,700 --> 03:26:46,900
Oh, okay, there we go.

2154
03:26:46,900 --> 03:26:48,260
I know which way I'm facing now.

2155
03:26:52,420 --> 03:27:22,100
Okay, so now we can use the night knight on, on the bee stuff.

2156
03:27:22,900 --> 03:27:24,340
Step into the empty clearing.

2157
03:27:26,340 --> 03:27:28,660
Okay, air is filled with the buzzing of bees.

2158
03:27:28,660 --> 03:27:31,220
Okay, then appears to be a giant beehive here.

2159
03:27:31,860 --> 03:27:34,340
Probably wouldn't be wise to keep going without doing something about it first.

2160
03:27:35,220 --> 03:27:36,100
Oh yeah, there's that.

2161
03:27:37,940 --> 03:27:39,700
Take out the sprayer and hold in one hand.

2162
03:27:40,660 --> 03:27:42,340
Should be able to use this to spray drugs.

2163
03:27:43,380 --> 03:27:44,660
Okay, bag?

2164
03:27:46,420 --> 03:27:47,300
Or can I just go?

2165
03:27:47,380 --> 03:27:52,820
Shoal, night knight?

2166
03:27:53,460 --> 03:27:55,300
Take out the night knight and put in the sprayer.

2167
03:28:03,060 --> 03:28:05,300
I take careful aim and spray the drug.

2168
03:28:08,180 --> 03:28:10,020
Oh, I should have been wearing,

2169
03:28:10,020 --> 03:28:11,780
I should have been wearing goggles for that.

2170
03:28:14,900 --> 03:28:16,500
The bees movements get slower.

2171
03:28:17,300 --> 03:28:21,780
Eventually the hive falls completely silent.

2172
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:25,460
Mercy, how do you like the game so far?

2173
03:28:25,460 --> 03:28:26,020
It's great.

2174
03:28:31,860 --> 03:28:35,140
I think the only time, senpai, where I was, I like,

2175
03:28:36,020 --> 03:28:39,060
I rage quit like a series.

2176
03:28:39,060 --> 03:28:46,340
I think was index, where the one character I found out was 15 years old.

2177
03:28:48,260 --> 03:28:50,740
I should show, show senpai's the character, hold on.

2178
03:28:52,340 --> 03:28:54,900
I know this is, we're, we're taking a small intermission.

2179
03:28:54,900 --> 03:28:56,340
I forgot what his name is.

2180
03:29:08,180 --> 03:29:08,980
Senpai!

2181
03:29:08,980 --> 03:29:09,620
Senpai!

2182
03:29:11,220 --> 03:29:13,300
Thank you for this five dollar super chat.

2183
03:29:17,860 --> 03:29:19,060
I rewatched the stream.

2184
03:29:19,060 --> 03:29:21,220
My apologies for drunken ramblings.

2185
03:29:21,220 --> 03:29:23,220
We'll lock up phone next time before I get,

2186
03:29:23,220 --> 03:29:25,060
I guess very blessed, very unprofessional life.

2187
03:29:25,060 --> 03:29:25,940
That's okay.

2188
03:29:25,940 --> 03:29:26,900
It was funny.

2189
03:29:27,620 --> 03:29:28,420
Hold on.

2190
03:29:28,420 --> 03:29:29,700
I'm going to save this image.

2191
03:29:30,980 --> 03:29:31,540
Not a web.

2192
03:29:45,140 --> 03:29:46,420
I'm going to screenshot this.

2193
03:29:46,420 --> 03:29:47,540
Hold on senpai.

2194
03:29:47,540 --> 03:29:48,180
I got this.

2195
03:29:57,140 --> 03:29:57,860
I got this.

2196
03:29:58,900 --> 03:30:00,020
I got this senpai.

2197
03:30:06,660 --> 03:30:07,700
Okay, okay.

2198
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:11,300
And then we'll add it to, to as an image file.

2199
03:30:13,700 --> 03:30:15,140
Careful, don't talk to yourself.

2200
03:30:15,140 --> 03:30:17,220
I'll, I'll be, I'll be extra careful.

2201
03:30:28,100 --> 03:30:31,220
And then it should be the last one.

2202
03:30:32,500 --> 03:30:33,540
This character!

2203
03:30:35,700 --> 03:30:37,220
This freaking character!

2204
03:30:38,020 --> 03:30:39,940
Senpai is 15 years old!

2205
03:30:46,100 --> 03:30:48,340
I like rage quits so hard.

2206
03:30:57,060 --> 03:30:58,900
I'm like, no fucking way!

2207
03:31:03,380 --> 03:31:04,260
He's 15.

2208
03:31:04,260 --> 03:31:05,380
I was like, damn!

2209
03:31:06,420 --> 03:31:07,460
Are you serious?

2210
03:31:15,540 --> 03:31:20,500
Wiki says 14, I was even more worse!

2211
03:31:20,500 --> 03:31:21,540
It's worse than I thought!

2212
03:31:21,540 --> 03:31:22,660
It's 14!

2213
03:31:22,660 --> 03:31:23,460
Nevermind!

2214
03:31:25,060 --> 03:31:26,420
Nevermind, he's 14.

2215
03:31:26,420 --> 03:31:27,540
That's even worse.

2216
03:31:27,540 --> 03:31:29,620
I thought, I remembered it completely wrong.

2217
03:31:32,980 --> 03:31:34,180
No, he's 14.

2218
03:31:34,180 --> 03:31:35,860
That's totally wrong.

2219
03:31:40,420 --> 03:31:42,980
Is there some magic or some synapse?

2220
03:31:43,300 --> 03:31:45,940
Is there some magic or some synanigan involved?

2221
03:31:46,900 --> 03:31:47,620
No.

2222
03:31:47,620 --> 03:31:48,740
I don't think so.

2223
03:31:48,740 --> 03:31:48,980
No.

2224
03:31:51,540 --> 03:31:53,380
This kid's fucking 14.

2225
03:31:55,700 --> 03:31:57,140
It has to be a mistranslation, right?

2226
03:32:00,420 --> 03:32:02,580
Oh, 14 now makes sense.

2227
03:32:02,580 --> 03:32:03,220
Come on.

2228
03:32:05,380 --> 03:32:07,220
Anyways, yeah, that's the character.

2229
03:32:07,220 --> 03:32:08,180
That's the character.

2230
03:32:08,740 --> 03:32:10,980
I, um, I like kind of rage quit.

2231
03:32:10,980 --> 03:32:12,500
I might pick it up again, but oh!

2232
03:32:13,060 --> 03:32:14,420
It just took me out of it.

2233
03:32:14,420 --> 03:32:15,620
I was like, no way.

2234
03:32:24,100 --> 03:32:26,580
I like, I was so into it and then that happened.

2235
03:32:26,580 --> 03:32:26,980
I was like.

2236
03:32:31,940 --> 03:32:33,140
Oh, I can't do it.

2237
03:32:37,620 --> 03:32:39,540
It's worse that it's not 15.

2238
03:32:39,540 --> 03:32:40,500
It's 14.

2239
03:32:40,500 --> 03:32:41,060
Oh man.

2240
03:32:43,460 --> 03:32:44,100
It's fine.

2241
03:32:44,100 --> 03:32:44,580
It's fine.

2242
03:32:44,580 --> 03:32:45,140
So fine.

2243
03:32:49,780 --> 03:32:52,500
But yeah, because we were talking about ages.

2244
03:32:54,260 --> 03:32:56,980
Doesn't the teacher look like an actual child also?

2245
03:32:56,980 --> 03:33:01,780
I don't remember, but I do remember just being shell shocked by,

2246
03:33:01,780 --> 03:33:05,700
by this kid and then just going, I can't do this man.

2247
03:33:05,860 --> 03:33:13,860
Okay, let's continue.

2248
03:33:13,860 --> 03:33:14,420
Okay.

2249
03:33:14,420 --> 03:33:15,940
So eventually the hive come.

2250
03:33:15,940 --> 03:33:17,060
Well, it's completely silent.

2251
03:33:17,780 --> 03:33:19,460
Used up one bottle of night night.

2252
03:33:23,700 --> 03:33:25,780
I've silenced every hive in this area.

2253
03:33:25,780 --> 03:33:26,740
Now we can pass through.

2254
03:33:28,020 --> 03:33:28,340
Yes.

2255
03:33:28,340 --> 03:33:28,740
All right.

2256
03:33:32,020 --> 03:33:32,900
Way to go.

2257
03:33:32,900 --> 03:33:33,540
Oh man.

2258
03:33:33,540 --> 03:33:34,260
You got this.

2259
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:39,220
Anything else?

2260
03:33:41,380 --> 03:33:42,100
No spooks.

2261
03:33:50,020 --> 03:33:51,140
What the fuck was that?

2262
03:33:51,700 --> 03:33:52,020
Whoa.

2263
03:33:53,220 --> 03:33:55,140
Did you just hear some kind of animal?

2264
03:33:59,220 --> 03:34:01,300
I heard it and sounds familiar.

2265
03:34:01,300 --> 03:34:03,940
Sorry, my stomach does kind of sound like someone's stomach.

2266
03:34:03,940 --> 03:34:05,940
Huh?

2267
03:34:05,940 --> 03:34:08,340
I say you wouldn't happen to have any night night yourself.

2268
03:34:09,140 --> 03:34:10,500
I have a lot of chlorophyll.

2269
03:34:11,460 --> 03:34:13,060
Farm, chlorophyll, yeah.

2270
03:34:18,020 --> 03:34:19,540
Oh wait, it's probably the bunny.

2271
03:34:22,900 --> 03:34:23,460
Turning around.

2272
03:34:23,460 --> 03:34:26,420
I wonder if it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2273
03:34:26,420 --> 03:34:27,540
It's the bunny.

2274
03:34:27,540 --> 03:34:28,180
It's bunny.

2275
03:34:29,380 --> 03:34:29,940
Yep.

2276
03:34:29,940 --> 03:34:31,380
That rabbit hops in front of me.

2277
03:34:34,020 --> 03:34:34,820
Evo she be.

2278
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:38,980
She be with her tan?

2279
03:34:38,980 --> 03:34:40,260
Toggle stop.

2280
03:34:47,700 --> 03:34:48,260
A bunny?

2281
03:34:49,700 --> 03:34:52,420
The rabbit's scare stares at us completely still.

2282
03:34:52,980 --> 03:34:54,740
It's almost like it's waiting for us to follow.

2283
03:34:56,740 --> 03:34:57,300
Hey, wait.

2284
03:34:58,980 --> 03:35:00,740
The next thing I know, I'm rushing after it.

2285
03:35:02,180 --> 03:35:03,780
Hey, hey, where do you think you're going?

2286
03:35:03,780 --> 03:35:06,180
Oh man, rabbit.

2287
03:35:13,060 --> 03:35:14,260
What's that H elementary?

2288
03:35:14,260 --> 03:35:16,900
It showed us up and guided us when we were in trouble.

2289
03:35:18,500 --> 03:35:19,700
Maybe the rabbit is good.

2290
03:35:20,340 --> 03:35:22,260
We shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

2291
03:35:25,620 --> 03:35:27,460
That's not some normal rabbit.

2292
03:35:27,460 --> 03:35:29,060
It's definitely acting with intent.

2293
03:35:29,860 --> 03:35:33,780
At last, the rabbit guides me too.

2294
03:35:36,820 --> 03:35:37,860
The fuck is this?

2295
03:35:39,300 --> 03:35:41,460
An old Shinto Tori gate.

2296
03:35:45,460 --> 03:35:47,380
It looks evil as shit, Kohai.

2297
03:35:49,140 --> 03:35:52,980
Well, what do you think I look like then?

2298
03:35:52,980 --> 03:35:55,140
Do I look evil to you, Senpai?

2299
03:35:59,060 --> 03:36:04,020
I'm super nice though, right?

2300
03:36:09,220 --> 03:36:10,820
Yeah, you look more phone friendly.

2301
03:36:10,820 --> 03:36:11,620
Seriously?

2302
03:36:13,780 --> 03:36:14,340
Of course not.

2303
03:36:14,340 --> 03:36:15,220
There's a heart on your face.

2304
03:36:15,220 --> 03:36:15,700
Broken.

2305
03:36:18,900 --> 03:36:20,100
Yeah, you look like a lot.

2306
03:36:21,540 --> 03:36:22,660
Evil but cute.

2307
03:36:22,660 --> 03:36:24,260
Why not the rabbit then?

2308
03:36:24,260 --> 03:36:25,220
Why not the rabbit?

2309
03:36:25,220 --> 03:36:26,420
It looks evil but cute.

2310
03:36:30,020 --> 03:36:35,540
What, purple and friendly isn't evil?

2311
03:36:35,540 --> 03:36:36,180
That's good, no?

2312
03:36:36,180 --> 03:36:37,620
What about a rabbit then?

2313
03:36:37,620 --> 03:36:39,460
A rabbit's cute, right?

2314
03:36:45,540 --> 03:36:47,220
There's a shrine here?

2315
03:36:50,740 --> 03:36:52,020
The rabbit's cute but evil.

2316
03:36:52,020 --> 03:36:52,820
There's a difference.

2317
03:36:52,820 --> 03:36:55,940
Okay, evil mercy be like I was supposed to be purple.

2318
03:36:56,900 --> 03:36:59,380
Purple's royalty and mercy is our queen.

2319
03:37:01,380 --> 03:37:02,100
Senpai.

2320
03:37:04,980 --> 03:37:05,860
Thank you Senpai.

2321
03:37:08,900 --> 03:37:11,620
I call it shadow sheebie, then we should follow it.

2322
03:37:11,620 --> 03:37:12,660
We should follow it.

2323
03:37:16,020 --> 03:37:18,180
Anything with red eyes should be instant red flag,

2324
03:37:18,180 --> 03:37:18,820
except for you.

2325
03:37:18,820 --> 03:37:19,620
I have red eyes.

2326
03:37:19,620 --> 03:37:21,540
Yeah, actually, yeah, I do have red eyes.

2327
03:37:22,500 --> 03:37:24,500
I don't know, it's kind of, yeah, it's red, right?

2328
03:37:26,260 --> 03:37:30,180
Purple's also the color corruption.

2329
03:37:30,180 --> 03:37:30,660
What?

2330
03:37:33,300 --> 03:37:34,660
Senpai, what are you implying?

2331
03:37:49,140 --> 03:37:50,900
Thank you, Nekohai, for joining.

2332
03:37:51,860 --> 03:37:55,620
Joining, I'm out of here.

2333
03:37:56,420 --> 03:37:57,220
Joining them buzz.

2334
03:38:00,420 --> 03:38:01,620
The rabbit looks back at me,

2335
03:38:03,860 --> 03:38:06,900
then soundlessly turns, it turns from the gate

2336
03:38:06,900 --> 03:38:08,580
and hops into a bush nearby.

2337
03:38:11,380 --> 03:38:15,860
Hey, old man, don't mess with me like that.

2338
03:38:15,860 --> 03:38:17,700
You're nuts running off like that.

2339
03:38:23,380 --> 03:38:25,300
The hell's with that bunny anyway?

2340
03:38:26,740 --> 03:38:33,060
Something's bothering me about it.

2341
03:38:33,060 --> 03:38:35,780
Sorry, I think that's totally a wrong voice.

2342
03:38:37,700 --> 03:38:39,060
I lost sight of it here, though.

2343
03:38:40,260 --> 03:38:41,780
Just then, from out of the darkness.

2344
03:38:45,620 --> 03:38:47,460
Not the bees!

2345
03:38:47,460 --> 03:38:48,900
Not the bees!

2346
03:38:51,300 --> 03:38:52,340
Why, I order.

2347
03:38:55,940 --> 03:38:57,700
Torrigate kind of messed up, yeah.

2348
03:39:00,820 --> 03:39:01,860
Bees!

2349
03:39:01,860 --> 03:39:04,260
A huge swarm of bees is sending us on us.

2350
03:39:04,980 --> 03:39:06,100
Shit, watch out!

2351
03:39:06,100 --> 03:39:08,100
There are bees everywhere!

2352
03:39:08,660 --> 03:39:10,180
And damn, we gotta get out of here.

2353
03:39:12,580 --> 03:39:16,260
Sho pulls my arm and we stumble back to the earlier crossroad.

2354
03:39:17,220 --> 03:39:20,500
The info was added to the spirit file, mysterious shrine.

2355
03:39:23,700 --> 03:39:24,020
Shit.

2356
03:39:26,260 --> 03:39:31,700
Oh no, there's some rope there.

2357
03:39:31,700 --> 03:39:32,100
No!

2358
03:39:36,660 --> 03:39:38,420
Hey, Senpai, which way do we turn?

2359
03:39:40,340 --> 03:39:41,620
Left or right?

2360
03:39:46,180 --> 03:39:46,900
Turn around?

2361
03:39:53,140 --> 03:39:53,700
Right?

2362
03:39:53,700 --> 03:39:54,020
Okay.

2363
03:39:56,340 --> 03:40:02,820
The buzzing of bees killed the area.

2364
03:40:02,820 --> 03:40:04,740
Looks like there's another giant beehive there.

2365
03:40:05,300 --> 03:40:08,020
Probably wouldn't be wise to keep going without doing something about them first.

2366
03:40:09,780 --> 03:40:11,540
Take up the sprayer and hold it in one hand.

2367
03:40:12,180 --> 03:40:13,700
Be able to use spray drugs.

2368
03:40:16,580 --> 03:40:20,580
I don't think, Senpais, I don't have enough.

2369
03:40:21,140 --> 03:40:25,860
I don't, I don't think I have any more, more, more night night.

2370
03:40:27,460 --> 03:40:28,980
Punch the beehive, Mercy.

2371
03:40:29,940 --> 03:40:31,540
That sounds like a terrible idea.

2372
03:40:31,540 --> 03:40:32,180
Okay, what about...

2373
03:40:37,460 --> 03:40:39,460
Oh, okay, we come back to the Torrigate again.

2374
03:40:40,820 --> 03:40:43,860
Can't you maybe add in a little spray, some drugs on the bees or something?

2375
03:40:44,660 --> 03:40:46,260
Even the sprayer could calm them down, but...

2376
03:40:48,660 --> 03:40:50,100
There's a hive above the gate too.

2377
03:40:50,580 --> 03:40:51,860
There's no way I can spray up there.

2378
03:40:52,980 --> 03:40:54,260
Damn, I can't do that, huh?

2379
03:40:54,260 --> 03:40:56,500
But something might be at the shrine.

2380
03:40:58,500 --> 03:41:01,380
True enough, but that time the rabbit brought me here,

2381
03:41:01,380 --> 03:41:02,900
it didn't try to go inside the gate.

2382
03:41:03,940 --> 03:41:06,820
Maybe there's no reason to force our way in.

2383
03:41:08,500 --> 03:41:09,300
Yeah, okay, bye!

2384
03:41:17,220 --> 03:41:18,580
Okay, we're driven away.

2385
03:41:18,660 --> 03:41:20,820
Um, left this time?

2386
03:41:24,420 --> 03:41:25,780
Another one, okay, no.

2387
03:41:31,380 --> 03:41:32,740
I don't have enough night night.

2388
03:41:41,060 --> 03:41:43,300
But these aren't that violent, these ones are.

2389
03:41:45,540 --> 03:41:46,340
I move forward.

2390
03:41:49,540 --> 03:41:51,140
Where the hell am I?

2391
03:41:51,860 --> 03:41:52,900
When did these get here?

2392
03:41:54,980 --> 03:41:59,220
Look, noticeably dirty as if someone hasn't been here looking after it,

2393
03:41:59,220 --> 03:42:00,500
and moss is growing on its back.

2394
03:42:02,020 --> 03:42:04,580
Had around the Giso statue to search it.

2395
03:42:04,580 --> 03:42:07,140
There's a strange texture on its moss covered backs.

2396
03:42:07,140 --> 03:42:10,820
When I brush away the moss, I find a yellowed paper stuck to the statue.

2397
03:42:12,260 --> 03:42:15,540
Found a worn out talisman.

2398
03:42:15,540 --> 03:42:17,060
When I pick up the worn out talisman,

2399
03:42:17,060 --> 03:42:18,500
I feel warmth flow through me.

2400
03:42:20,980 --> 03:42:21,860
Got soul power.

2401
03:42:22,580 --> 03:42:32,980
Worn out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.

2402
03:42:38,580 --> 03:42:41,380
There's some sly sliding wooden doors.

2403
03:42:41,380 --> 03:42:44,340
Look, small crack between the doors.

2404
03:42:44,340 --> 03:42:46,820
I can only imagine it creates a bad draft.

2405
03:42:48,500 --> 03:42:48,900
Feel.

2406
03:42:49,860 --> 03:42:51,780
Lighting door won't open, they seem to be locked.

2407
03:42:53,220 --> 03:42:54,500
Can I use the crowbar on it?

2408
03:42:56,180 --> 03:42:58,180
I got the crowbar and jamming into the door.

2409
03:42:59,380 --> 03:43:00,980
Yeah, yeah, do it!

2410
03:43:00,980 --> 03:43:01,860
It's the fastest way.

2411
03:43:02,820 --> 03:43:03,700
Can't break the lock.

2412
03:43:04,900 --> 03:43:07,860
Or my body weight behind the crowbar two or three times then.

2413
03:43:09,380 --> 03:43:10,740
There's a sound of metal breaking.

2414
03:43:11,620 --> 03:43:12,100
What?

2415
03:43:13,220 --> 03:43:15,060
Crowbar snaps completely into two pieces!

2416
03:43:15,940 --> 03:43:16,340
Shit.

2417
03:43:18,740 --> 03:43:20,980
Lost crowbar and got broken crowbar.

2418
03:43:22,340 --> 03:43:23,860
Too much force, old man.

2419
03:43:23,860 --> 03:43:25,860
At least the lock up busted too.

2420
03:43:25,860 --> 03:43:26,180
Good.

2421
03:43:26,980 --> 03:43:28,340
Hurry it up and look inside.

2422
03:43:29,940 --> 03:43:31,460
But you're going inside with me, right?

2423
03:43:36,180 --> 03:43:37,540
You overdid it, man.

2424
03:43:37,540 --> 03:43:38,260
The door's a mess.

2425
03:43:38,260 --> 03:43:39,780
You made it even harder to open now.

2426
03:43:40,740 --> 03:43:42,340
Push the door open and step inside.

2427
03:43:43,940 --> 03:43:45,220
Only to run into something.

2428
03:43:47,300 --> 03:43:48,740
Stop, stop!

2429
03:43:48,740 --> 03:43:49,940
Don't come close, any closer.

2430
03:43:53,780 --> 03:43:55,780
If you come any closer, I'll sue.

2431
03:43:57,060 --> 03:43:59,700
A woman has backed up in a defensive stance.

2432
03:44:02,100 --> 03:44:04,660
I'm a black belt in Taekwondo.

2433
03:44:06,260 --> 03:44:08,100
Oh, okay, we have a normal woman.

2434
03:44:10,740 --> 03:44:17,460
If you try anything, Al.

2435
03:44:19,140 --> 03:44:20,100
Shut up, old lady!

2436
03:44:22,180 --> 03:44:23,380
Shut up, old lady!

2437
03:44:25,220 --> 03:44:26,100
Old?

2438
03:44:27,140 --> 03:44:32,180
At Chills' Roar, the woman treaks and falls silent eyes wide.

2439
03:44:32,180 --> 03:44:34,340
Incredibly rude, but honestly, I'm grateful.

2440
03:44:34,580 --> 03:44:42,100
We wait for the woman to calm down before asking what she's doing here.

2441
03:44:48,420 --> 03:44:50,980
Forgive me, it was all a misunderstanding on my part.

2442
03:44:52,660 --> 03:44:56,740
I'm Kristi Arimura, freelance news anchor.

2443
03:44:57,780 --> 03:44:59,300
Oh, I haven't done much recently.

2444
03:45:00,740 --> 03:45:01,780
Wait, I've seen you!

2445
03:45:01,780 --> 03:45:03,780
You're the woman that was in the news!

2446
03:45:04,420 --> 03:45:05,460
Wow, that's really true!

2447
03:45:05,460 --> 03:45:07,540
Celebrity is on a more beautiful person!

2448
03:45:17,220 --> 03:45:19,540
Get that out, this isn't the time for flattery.

2449
03:45:22,580 --> 03:45:25,060
She says that, but she doesn't sound that upset.

2450
03:45:26,340 --> 03:45:27,940
She seems to love being complimented.

2451
03:45:28,500 --> 03:45:30,580
Speaking of senpai...

2452
03:45:30,980 --> 03:45:34,980
Oh, where's my compliment?

2453
03:45:47,700 --> 03:45:48,820
Kohai's cute, yay!

2454
03:45:50,260 --> 03:45:51,300
Best Kohai.

2455
03:45:51,300 --> 03:45:52,740
Beautiful mercy, yeah.

2456
03:45:58,180 --> 03:45:59,380
Yeah, that's the stuff.

2457
03:46:00,580 --> 03:46:05,380
Thank you, thank you senpai!

2458
03:46:19,700 --> 03:46:20,580
Yay!

2459
03:46:20,580 --> 03:46:22,580
Aww, senpais!

2460
03:46:22,580 --> 03:46:23,940
Senpais are so nice to me.

2461
03:46:24,500 --> 03:46:25,540
Yay, thank you!

2462
03:46:25,860 --> 03:46:32,740
Um, anyway, what are you doing here?

2463
03:46:35,700 --> 03:46:36,900
Your expression clouds over.

2464
03:46:38,340 --> 03:46:40,820
Well, feel huffed at me.

2465
03:46:42,020 --> 03:46:43,460
You really have to ask!

2466
03:46:45,300 --> 03:46:47,300
You lost your tack in your old age!

2467
03:46:52,180 --> 03:46:54,260
Masao Kimura's face comes to mind.

2468
03:46:56,500 --> 03:46:58,260
That's right, this place is...

2469
03:47:01,620 --> 03:47:02,900
I was going to die.

2470
03:47:06,900 --> 03:47:09,380
Yes, I know, full well just how stupid that is.

2471
03:47:10,180 --> 03:47:12,580
But sometimes that's the only choice you have left.

2472
03:47:13,940 --> 03:47:17,540
I shouldn't have known better of such a thoughtless question past my lips.

2473
03:47:18,100 --> 03:47:20,260
Wow, we really have no riz.

2474
03:47:20,820 --> 03:47:22,020
Zero, none!

2475
03:47:25,540 --> 03:47:39,860
It's a woman, so you know how to de-escalate, right?

2476
03:47:39,860 --> 03:47:40,180
No!

2477
03:47:44,020 --> 03:47:46,260
We are so riz-less senpais.

2478
03:47:47,380 --> 03:47:48,180
How could we?

2479
03:47:48,260 --> 03:47:56,500
I wish I could blame the mark for this.

2480
03:47:57,860 --> 03:48:01,060
Oh yeah, I heard something about you fooling around with another celebrity.

2481
03:48:04,900 --> 03:48:08,660
Like, is call- is- is call-hi-mercy?

2482
03:48:08,660 --> 03:48:09,300
Riz-less?

2483
03:48:09,300 --> 03:48:11,060
No, we are riz-less.

2484
03:48:13,460 --> 03:48:14,980
Not that I care about that stuff.

2485
03:48:15,700 --> 03:48:20,420
That's why I came out here, so I wouldn't cause trouble for anyone.

2486
03:48:25,380 --> 03:48:28,580
At the very end, I thought about calling someone, but couldn't so...

2487
03:48:32,260 --> 03:48:33,140
I made up my mind.

2488
03:48:33,700 --> 03:48:35,140
But- but then in the forest...

2489
03:48:36,260 --> 03:48:37,460
I have a bad feeling about this.

2490
03:48:41,140 --> 03:48:43,700
What was... in the forest?

2491
03:48:45,620 --> 03:48:49,220
A huge man.

2492
03:48:49,220 --> 03:48:50,980
An extremely huge man.

2493
03:48:53,620 --> 03:48:56,820
I don't know, I'm not even sure if he was really human or not.

2494
03:48:58,820 --> 03:49:00,980
But I saw a figure like that.

2495
03:49:00,980 --> 03:49:02,100
I suddenly got scared.

2496
03:49:03,140 --> 03:49:04,340
I ran into this cottage.

2497
03:49:05,140 --> 03:49:07,300
I'm here to kill myself and I just run from danger.

2498
03:49:07,300 --> 03:49:08,020
I'm a riot.

2499
03:49:11,700 --> 03:49:13,060
What- what's wrong?

2500
03:49:13,060 --> 03:49:14,340
You two aren't saying anything.

2501
03:49:15,940 --> 03:49:18,020
That's the same as what I-

2502
03:49:19,460 --> 03:49:19,700
Yeah.

2503
03:49:21,060 --> 03:49:22,500
Christy must have seen shimmy-o.

2504
03:49:23,140 --> 03:49:24,420
Which means she must also.

2505
03:49:25,860 --> 03:49:27,460
You got in a weird scar recently.

2506
03:49:32,180 --> 03:49:33,780
One that stings every now and then.

2507
03:49:37,300 --> 03:49:39,140
I know the answer just from her reaction.

2508
03:49:40,660 --> 03:49:41,300
How'd you know?

2509
03:49:42,420 --> 03:49:44,020
I- I only just noticed it myself.

2510
03:49:44,100 --> 03:49:46,020
There's a strange bite mark on my palm.

2511
03:49:49,780 --> 03:49:50,660
This is crazy.

2512
03:49:52,980 --> 03:49:55,860
Someone receives the mark when they're already planning suicide.

2513
03:49:55,860 --> 03:49:57,700
The height of irony.

2514
03:50:01,380 --> 03:50:03,300
Hey old man, what are we supposed to do now?

2515
03:50:03,860 --> 03:50:06,260
That lady came to offer self, you know?

2516
03:50:07,060 --> 03:50:08,340
There any point in helping her?

2517
03:50:09,300 --> 03:50:11,620
Well, what if she changed her mind?

2518
03:50:11,620 --> 03:50:12,100
Shut up!

2519
03:50:14,980 --> 03:50:15,860
Help me!

2520
03:50:15,860 --> 03:50:17,300
I'm not going to kill myself anymore.

2521
03:50:17,300 --> 03:50:19,380
I swear, so please, I'm terrified of him.

2522
03:50:21,860 --> 03:50:22,820
Her eyes are serious.

2523
03:50:22,820 --> 03:50:24,020
She must mean what she says.

2524
03:50:24,900 --> 03:50:26,980
I only be a temporary change of heart, but...

2525
03:50:28,260 --> 03:50:29,460
Alright, we'll help you.

2526
03:50:30,500 --> 03:50:32,100
Our home base is Kujo Mansion.

2527
03:50:32,100 --> 03:50:32,900
You need to go.

2528
03:50:41,620 --> 03:50:43,220
Stop messing with the flies!

2529
03:50:44,020 --> 03:50:44,740
Ashlight, old man!

2530
03:50:49,300 --> 03:50:49,940
Sampai!

2531
03:50:54,740 --> 03:50:55,460
What's happening?

2532
03:50:58,820 --> 03:50:59,300
Sampai's...

2533
03:51:00,420 --> 03:51:01,140
We might be...

2534
03:51:02,020 --> 03:51:02,980
We're in thwobble.

2535
03:51:04,180 --> 03:51:05,060
I'm in danger!

2536
03:51:08,820 --> 03:51:09,700
Well, I won't turn on.

2537
03:51:14,020 --> 03:51:16,020
What's happened before about back then?

2538
03:51:24,020 --> 03:51:26,020
I got it to go back on right away.

2539
03:51:28,020 --> 03:51:30,020
Aaaaaaahhh!

2540
03:51:34,020 --> 03:51:36,020
I got it to go back on right away.

2541
03:51:38,020 --> 03:51:40,020
Aaaaaaahhh!

2542
03:51:44,980 --> 03:51:46,020
But this time, it's not working.

2543
03:51:48,020 --> 03:51:48,980
Aaaaaaahhh!

2544
03:51:50,020 --> 03:51:50,820
What was that?

2545
03:51:54,020 --> 03:51:56,020
Aaaaaaahhh!

2546
03:51:58,020 --> 03:52:00,020
No, I'm from behind the cottage!

2547
03:52:00,020 --> 03:52:02,020
Is something there?

2548
03:52:02,020 --> 03:52:04,020
Shit, there's no use.

2549
03:52:04,020 --> 03:52:08,020
I gave up on the flashlight and stuff it in my bag.

2550
03:52:08,020 --> 03:52:09,020
What's the plan now?

2551
03:52:09,020 --> 03:52:10,020
Do we bunker down in this cottage?

2552
03:52:10,020 --> 03:52:11,020
We can't even lie.

2553
03:52:11,020 --> 03:52:13,020
We have to run out of the forest.

2554
03:52:15,020 --> 03:52:17,020
Are you insane?

2555
03:52:23,020 --> 03:52:25,020
This day here will be suicide.

2556
03:52:27,020 --> 03:52:29,020
This place is strangely clean.

2557
03:52:29,020 --> 03:52:31,020
That means someone is coming here.

2558
03:52:31,020 --> 03:52:33,020
I mean, she comes here?

2559
03:52:33,020 --> 03:52:35,020
Let's go. We walked all the way here.

2560
03:52:35,020 --> 03:52:37,020
We should know how to get back.

2561
03:52:39,020 --> 03:52:41,020
You're seriously going? Are you mad?

2562
03:52:41,020 --> 03:52:43,020
Sorry, but we're out of time.

2563
03:52:43,020 --> 03:52:45,020
Stay here if you want. I won't stop you.

2564
03:52:45,020 --> 03:52:47,020
Aaaaaaahhh!

2565
03:52:49,020 --> 03:52:51,020
Step out of pitch-clackness.

2566
03:52:51,020 --> 03:52:53,020
Damn it, I can hardly see.

2567
03:52:53,020 --> 03:52:55,020
We need to go straight.

2568
03:52:55,020 --> 03:52:57,020
We need to get out of here.

2569
03:52:57,020 --> 03:52:59,020
Step out of pitch-clackness.

2570
03:52:59,020 --> 03:53:01,020
Damn it, I can hardly see.

2571
03:53:01,020 --> 03:53:03,020
We need to go straight back

2572
03:53:03,020 --> 03:53:05,020
to the entrance with no detours.

2573
03:53:17,020 --> 03:53:21,020
I was lost on the way here, so...

2574
03:53:23,020 --> 03:53:25,020
I don't know.

2575
03:53:27,020 --> 03:53:29,020
Not as bad as you think it is.

2576
03:53:29,020 --> 03:53:31,020
Ah, shit.

2577
03:53:33,020 --> 03:53:35,020
We've got no idea where he could be waiting.

2578
03:53:37,020 --> 03:53:39,020
You remember the way, right, Mercy?

2579
03:53:39,020 --> 03:53:41,020
I got lost in the middle.

2580
03:53:47,020 --> 03:53:49,020
Where's Leemina Rush?

2581
03:53:49,020 --> 03:53:51,020
I hadn't split them out.

2582
03:53:51,020 --> 03:53:53,020
I would never finish.

2583
03:53:53,020 --> 03:53:55,020
My voice is starting to shake too much.

2584
03:53:55,020 --> 03:53:57,020
Maybe I should save before we're in an entire spot.

2585
03:53:57,020 --> 03:53:59,020
Can I save?

2586
03:53:59,020 --> 03:54:01,020
I'm not at the mansion!

2587
03:54:05,020 --> 03:54:07,020
New info was added to the spirit file.

2588
03:54:07,020 --> 03:54:09,020
A markbearer in a cottage.

2589
03:54:25,020 --> 03:54:27,020
Okay.

2590
03:54:27,020 --> 03:54:29,020
Back.

2591
03:54:33,020 --> 03:54:35,020
We're at a fork already.

2592
03:54:45,020 --> 03:54:47,020
Which way?

2593
03:54:47,020 --> 03:54:49,020
Where do we go?

2594
03:54:51,020 --> 03:54:53,020
I don't remember, Senpai.

2595
03:54:55,020 --> 03:54:57,020
Was it...

2596
03:54:59,020 --> 03:55:01,020
Was it forward?

2597
03:55:03,020 --> 03:55:05,020
Left?

2598
03:55:05,020 --> 03:55:07,020
I don't know if that's right.

2599
03:55:13,020 --> 03:55:15,020
Maybe it is left?

2600
03:55:15,020 --> 03:55:17,020
I think right is the tori gate.

2601
03:55:17,020 --> 03:55:19,020
Left was a bee path.

2602
03:55:19,020 --> 03:55:21,020
Would it be forward then?

2603
03:55:21,020 --> 03:55:23,020
Forward then?

2604
03:55:23,020 --> 03:55:25,020
Oh my gosh.

2605
03:55:25,020 --> 03:55:27,020
Can you read the map?

2606
03:55:31,020 --> 03:55:33,020
I think east.

2607
03:55:33,020 --> 03:55:35,020
We came from the east.

2608
03:55:37,020 --> 03:55:39,020
Never... Which way is east?

2609
03:55:45,020 --> 03:55:47,020
Right, okay.

2610
03:55:47,020 --> 03:55:49,020
Okay.

2611
03:55:49,020 --> 03:55:51,020
Yeah!

2612
03:55:51,020 --> 03:55:53,020
Don't yell, lady!

2613
03:55:53,020 --> 03:55:55,020
Don't yell, lady!

2614
03:55:55,020 --> 03:55:57,020
Something's coming closer.

2615
03:55:57,020 --> 03:55:59,020
We need to get out of here fast.

2616
03:55:59,020 --> 03:56:01,020
Uh...

2617
03:56:01,020 --> 03:56:03,020
East?

2618
03:56:03,020 --> 03:56:05,020
Forward.

2619
03:56:05,020 --> 03:56:07,020
Another fork?

2620
03:56:07,020 --> 03:56:09,020
Which way this time?

2621
03:56:09,020 --> 03:56:11,020
South. It's south!

2622
03:56:11,020 --> 03:56:13,020
The exit should be straight ahead from there.

2623
03:56:15,020 --> 03:56:17,020
Quiet.

2624
03:56:19,020 --> 03:56:23,020
Something's passing through the bushes right by us.

2625
03:56:25,020 --> 03:56:27,020
Now the game tells us that's good.

2626
03:56:35,020 --> 03:56:37,020
Is he following us?

2627
03:56:37,020 --> 03:56:39,020
Even if he was, he is.

2628
03:56:39,020 --> 03:56:41,020
We have to keep going.

2629
03:56:41,020 --> 03:56:45,020
That's no way we can just stand around anymore!

2630
03:56:45,020 --> 03:56:47,020
Right, let's go!

2631
03:56:49,020 --> 03:56:51,020
Move around.

2632
03:56:53,020 --> 03:56:55,020
Move forward.

2633
03:56:55,020 --> 03:56:57,020
Move forward.

2634
03:56:59,020 --> 03:57:01,020
Wait a second.

2635
03:57:01,020 --> 03:57:03,020
No, wait a second.

2636
03:57:03,020 --> 03:57:05,020
I see something stops.

2637
03:57:05,020 --> 03:57:07,020
What's wrong?

2638
03:57:07,020 --> 03:57:09,020
What's coming?

2639
03:57:09,020 --> 03:57:11,020
I'm telling you, someone's coming.

2640
03:57:13,020 --> 03:57:15,020
Not from the darkness jumps.

2641
03:57:15,020 --> 03:57:17,020
Mashita!

2642
03:57:25,020 --> 03:57:27,020
So this is where you were.

2643
03:57:27,020 --> 03:57:29,020
You're closer than I thought.

2644
03:57:33,020 --> 03:57:35,020
Wait, why are you here?

2645
03:57:37,020 --> 03:57:41,020
I had a bad feeling, so I grabbed a car and made my way here.

2646
03:57:41,020 --> 03:57:43,020
Looks like you're in an erupt spot.

2647
03:57:45,020 --> 03:57:47,020
Can you say that again?

2648
03:57:47,020 --> 03:57:49,020
Anyway, we're on our way back.

2649
03:57:49,020 --> 03:57:51,020
Good plan.

2650
03:57:51,020 --> 03:57:53,020
Mashita glances over at Christie.

2651
03:57:53,020 --> 03:57:55,020
Run! Run now!

2652
03:57:55,020 --> 03:57:57,020
Explain later! We gotta get out of here!

2653
03:58:03,020 --> 03:58:05,020
We reach the entrance safe and sound.

2654
03:58:05,020 --> 03:58:09,020
The creepy murderer on the Ark is such a familiar sight now.

2655
03:58:09,020 --> 03:58:13,020
Alright, if we made it this far, then we must be...

2656
03:58:13,020 --> 03:58:15,020
Yeah, it's all good now.

2657
03:58:21,020 --> 03:58:23,020
Christie doesn't move.

2658
03:58:23,020 --> 03:58:25,020
She looks worried, staring off into the forest entrance.

2659
03:58:27,020 --> 03:58:29,020
What's wrong?

2660
03:58:31,020 --> 03:58:33,020
Over there.

2661
03:58:33,020 --> 03:58:35,020
Doesn't it look like someone's there?

2662
03:58:37,020 --> 03:58:39,020
She's looking at the picnic table, hiding in the gloom next to the gate.

2663
03:58:39,020 --> 03:58:41,020
The gaze is drawn over as if by magnets.

2664
03:58:43,020 --> 03:58:45,020
What is...

2665
03:58:45,020 --> 03:58:47,020
No!

2666
03:58:49,020 --> 03:58:51,020
No, we just saved him!

2667
03:58:51,020 --> 03:58:53,020
No!

2668
03:58:55,020 --> 03:58:57,020
Is he having a beer?

2669
03:59:03,020 --> 03:59:05,020
What is that?

2670
03:59:07,020 --> 03:59:09,020
The scene before me is strange.

2671
03:59:09,020 --> 03:59:11,020
No!

2672
03:59:13,020 --> 03:59:15,020
Wait, is he having a beer too?

2673
03:59:15,020 --> 03:59:17,020
Are they drinking beer together?

2674
03:59:17,020 --> 03:59:19,020
That's kind of nice, but also...

2675
03:59:23,020 --> 03:59:25,020
We just saved him!

2676
03:59:25,020 --> 03:59:27,020
He was gonna have a drink with us!

2677
03:59:33,020 --> 03:59:37,020
The huge misshapen man with beads crawling all over his face.

2678
03:59:37,020 --> 03:59:39,020
The eyes fixate on his mouth.

2679
03:59:39,020 --> 03:59:41,020
Looks like he's laughing.

2680
03:59:43,020 --> 03:59:45,020
My heart thunders painfully,

2681
03:59:45,020 --> 03:59:49,020
and I catch a glimpse of the limp figure sitting beside him.

2682
03:59:53,020 --> 03:59:55,020
It's him, that man.

2683
03:59:55,020 --> 03:59:57,020
He's going to commit suicide.

2684
03:59:57,020 --> 03:59:59,020
Masao Kimura, it's definitely him.

2685
04:00:09,020 --> 04:00:11,020
Control those that are different in exercise.

2686
04:00:13,020 --> 04:00:15,020
That strange voice echoes in my head again.

2687
04:00:15,020 --> 04:00:17,020
My vision warps.

2688
04:00:17,020 --> 04:00:19,020
He's dead?

2689
04:00:19,020 --> 04:00:21,020
Kimura's dead?

2690
04:00:21,020 --> 04:00:23,020
What? Why is he on that bench?

2691
04:00:25,020 --> 04:00:27,020
My legs give out when I finally focus enough.

2692
04:00:27,020 --> 04:00:29,020
I find myself kneeling on the ground.

2693
04:00:31,020 --> 04:00:33,020
Oh man, keep it together!

2694
04:00:33,020 --> 04:00:35,020
It's still okay, he hasn't seen us!

2695
04:00:39,020 --> 04:00:41,020
We have to escape while we can.

2696
04:00:41,020 --> 04:00:43,020
You see, he's completely out of it.

2697
04:00:43,020 --> 04:00:45,020
She won't move an inch unless someone drags her.

2698
04:00:47,020 --> 04:00:49,020
Let's go.

2699
04:00:49,020 --> 04:00:51,020
We're going to the parking lot.

2700
04:00:53,020 --> 04:00:55,020
You bring her.

2701
04:00:55,020 --> 04:00:57,020
You got it!

2702
04:00:59,020 --> 04:01:01,020
Come on, Mashita, let's go.

2703
04:01:05,020 --> 04:01:07,020
Mashita?

2704
04:01:07,020 --> 04:01:09,020
Mashita?

2705
04:01:11,020 --> 04:01:13,020
He's gone.

2706
04:01:13,020 --> 04:01:15,020
Took my eyes off him for two seconds

2707
04:01:15,020 --> 04:01:17,020
and he's not by the bench anymore.

2708
04:01:21,020 --> 04:01:23,020
The machine growls

2709
04:01:23,020 --> 04:01:25,020
and the undergrowth near us rustles.

2710
04:01:27,020 --> 04:01:29,020
Yeah, he's right there!

2711
04:01:29,020 --> 04:01:31,020
Run!

2712
04:01:31,020 --> 04:01:33,020
Mashita yells, scrambling away.

2713
04:01:33,020 --> 04:01:35,020
The hollow

2714
04:01:35,020 --> 04:01:37,020
bang rings out from behind me.

2715
04:01:37,020 --> 04:01:39,020
A gunshot?

2716
04:01:39,020 --> 04:01:41,020
Must be Mashita.

2717
04:01:41,020 --> 04:01:43,020
I had no idea he had a gun.

2718
04:01:45,020 --> 04:01:47,020
I dive head first into the car,

2719
04:01:47,020 --> 04:01:49,020
slamming my head accidentally into the steering wheel.

2720
04:01:51,020 --> 04:01:53,020
Mashita tumbles into the passenger's

2721
04:01:53,020 --> 04:01:55,020
seat last.

2722
04:01:57,020 --> 04:01:59,020
He didn't tell me he had a gun.

2723
04:01:59,020 --> 04:02:01,020
Why would I tell you? No time to talk now.

2724
04:02:01,020 --> 04:02:03,020
Just hit the gas.

2725
04:02:03,020 --> 04:02:05,020
I'm trying!

2726
04:02:05,020 --> 04:02:07,020
Engine won't start.

2727
04:02:07,020 --> 04:02:09,020
Shit, shit.

2728
04:02:09,020 --> 04:02:11,020
Oh, oh man, what are you doing?

2729
04:02:11,020 --> 04:02:13,020
Mashita looks through the front windshield

2730
04:02:13,020 --> 04:02:15,020
at the figure approaching.

2731
04:02:15,020 --> 04:02:17,020
Hurry it up, he's coming!

2732
04:02:17,020 --> 04:02:19,020
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

2733
04:02:19,020 --> 04:02:21,020
Shoot the fucking shit!

2734
04:02:21,020 --> 04:02:23,020
Shoot, shoot it!

2735
04:02:23,020 --> 04:02:25,020
Shoot the fucking thing!

2736
04:02:25,020 --> 04:02:27,020
Wait, Christy cowards in the back seat

2737
04:02:27,020 --> 04:02:29,020
her head and her hands.

2738
04:02:29,020 --> 04:02:31,020
He's gone.

2739
04:02:33,020 --> 04:02:35,020
Something bombed the hood of the car,

2740
04:02:35,020 --> 04:02:37,020
the whole vehicle rocked violently.

2741
04:02:37,020 --> 04:02:39,020
Then...

2742
04:02:39,020 --> 04:02:41,020
it turned on.

2743
04:02:43,020 --> 04:02:45,020
Go, let's get the hell out of here!

2744
04:02:49,020 --> 04:02:51,020
Tire squealing, we race out of the parking lot.

2745
04:02:59,020 --> 04:03:01,020
An unspeakable sense of relief

2746
04:03:01,020 --> 04:03:03,020
fills the car.

2747
04:03:05,020 --> 04:03:07,020
If feeling truly alive

2748
04:03:07,020 --> 04:03:09,020
is a real sensation,

2749
04:03:09,020 --> 04:03:11,020
then it most definitely feels like this.

2750
04:03:13,020 --> 04:03:15,020
Where sees Toyota did it?

2751
04:03:15,020 --> 04:03:17,020
My car would never,

2752
04:03:17,020 --> 04:03:19,020
unless it's winter,

2753
04:03:19,020 --> 04:03:21,020
would never not start.

2754
04:03:23,020 --> 04:03:25,020
The greatest irony is that the only time

2755
04:03:25,020 --> 04:03:27,020
you can feel truly alive

2756
04:03:27,020 --> 04:03:29,020
is when you have a brush with death.

2757
04:03:31,020 --> 04:03:33,020
No one speaks for a while,

2758
04:03:33,020 --> 04:03:35,020
we're all soaking in that feeling.

2759
04:03:39,020 --> 04:03:41,020
Why is it more cooperative in winter?

2760
04:03:41,020 --> 04:03:43,020
It's uncooperative in winter,

2761
04:03:43,020 --> 04:03:45,020
so...

2762
04:03:45,020 --> 04:03:47,020
So it can

2763
04:03:47,020 --> 04:03:49,020
have trouble starting in winter

2764
04:03:49,020 --> 04:03:51,020
and you have to probably jump start it.

2765
04:03:53,020 --> 04:03:55,020
Yeah.

2766
04:03:57,020 --> 04:03:59,020
It's just a problem for everyone.

2767
04:04:01,020 --> 04:04:03,020
It's only after we've left the mountain

2768
04:04:03,020 --> 04:04:05,020
and reached buildings again that I feel like talking.

2769
04:04:07,020 --> 04:04:09,020
Still,

2770
04:04:09,020 --> 04:04:11,020
I glance through the rear view mirror

2771
04:04:11,020 --> 04:04:13,020
and then at the passenger seat,

2772
04:04:13,020 --> 04:04:15,020
both Maschita and Sho are looking out their windows.

2773
04:04:17,020 --> 04:04:19,020
Is it really okay for you to come here?

2774
04:04:19,020 --> 04:04:21,020
Mary finds out.

2775
04:04:21,020 --> 04:04:23,020
Obviously I came with her permission.

2776
04:04:27,020 --> 04:04:29,020
Maschita immediately retorts.

2777
04:04:29,020 --> 04:04:31,020
If I hadn't,

2778
04:04:31,020 --> 04:04:33,020
I wouldn't have come.

2779
04:04:33,020 --> 04:04:35,020
I get it.

2780
04:04:35,020 --> 04:04:37,020
Mary must have also guessed that we were in danger.

2781
04:04:39,020 --> 04:04:41,020
So,

2782
04:04:41,020 --> 04:04:43,020
what happened to that ex...

2783
04:04:43,020 --> 04:04:45,020
So what happened to that explanation?

2784
04:04:45,020 --> 04:04:47,020
Who's that woman behind us?

2785
04:04:47,020 --> 04:04:49,020
Alright.

2786
04:04:49,020 --> 04:04:51,020
I tell him everything I know so far

2787
04:04:51,020 --> 04:04:53,020
about Christy Adimura.

2788
04:04:53,020 --> 04:04:55,020
She offers up some details as well.

2789
04:04:55,020 --> 04:04:57,020
The moment her background comes to light,

2790
04:04:57,020 --> 04:04:59,020
Maschita smiles coldly.

2791
04:04:59,020 --> 04:05:01,020
Adimura?

2792
04:05:01,020 --> 04:05:03,020
Right now that you mentioned it,

2793
04:05:03,020 --> 04:05:05,020
I do remember you.

2794
04:05:07,020 --> 04:05:09,020
Oh yeah.

2795
04:05:09,020 --> 04:05:11,020
Thank goodness Maschita was there

2796
04:05:11,020 --> 04:05:13,020
and thank goodness he has a gun!

2797
04:05:17,020 --> 04:05:19,020
We're fired over that scandal.

2798
04:05:21,020 --> 04:05:23,020
Why? I never...

2799
04:05:23,020 --> 04:05:25,020
Can I be disgusted or amazed at his rudeness?

2800
04:05:29,020 --> 04:05:31,020
But these scars you...

2801
04:05:31,020 --> 04:05:33,020
But these scars you all had.

2802
04:05:33,020 --> 04:05:35,020
What are they called?

2803
04:05:35,020 --> 04:05:37,020
Marks.

2804
04:05:37,020 --> 04:05:39,020
Thanks. So, all of you have these marks.

2805
04:05:41,020 --> 04:05:43,020
What happens when you have one?

2806
04:05:43,020 --> 04:05:45,020
Well...

2807
04:05:47,020 --> 04:05:49,020
Maschita butts in from the passenger seat.

2808
04:05:49,020 --> 04:05:51,020
You die within a few days time.

2809
04:05:53,020 --> 04:05:55,020
Suffering from something like amnesia.

2810
04:05:55,020 --> 04:05:57,020
You zone out. Your brain takes a vacation.

2811
04:05:57,020 --> 04:05:59,020
It all happened to me.

2812
04:06:01,020 --> 04:06:03,020
Show scoffs.

2813
04:06:03,020 --> 04:06:05,020
You talk like it's someone else's problem.

2814
04:06:07,020 --> 04:06:09,020
Maschita didn't mean it like that.

2815
04:06:09,020 --> 04:06:11,020
You can only be blunt when discussing this.

2816
04:06:13,020 --> 04:06:15,020
Doesn't look like show will buy that excuse though.

2817
04:06:19,020 --> 04:06:21,020
Yes. Yes, it's really not your problem.

2818
04:06:21,020 --> 04:06:23,020
After all, you don't have a mark anymore.

2819
04:06:25,020 --> 04:06:27,020
Oh. What's he talking about?

2820
04:06:27,020 --> 04:06:29,020
Oh, well, you see...

2821
04:06:29,020 --> 04:06:31,020
Maschita has already lost

2822
04:06:31,020 --> 04:06:33,020
Hanna Hiko's mark. He's free now.

2823
04:06:37,020 --> 04:06:39,020
So, there's no good reason for him

2824
04:06:39,020 --> 04:06:41,020
to be here with us, but...

2825
04:06:41,020 --> 04:06:43,020
You're putting yourself...

2826
04:06:45,020 --> 04:06:47,020
In danger for the truth?

2827
04:06:47,020 --> 04:06:49,020
I can't believe it. You're like a saint.

2828
04:06:49,020 --> 04:06:51,020
Wait.

2829
04:06:51,020 --> 04:06:53,020
You're putting yourself out there for the truth?

2830
04:06:53,020 --> 04:06:55,020
You're like a saint.

2831
04:06:55,020 --> 04:06:56,020
There you go.

2832
04:06:56,020 --> 04:06:57,020
Christie's exaggerated compliment

2833
04:06:57,020 --> 04:06:59,020
is drowned out by Maschita's sardonic laugh.

2834
04:06:59,020 --> 04:07:01,020
It's nothing that noble.

2835
04:07:03,020 --> 04:07:05,020
But thanks to that,

2836
04:07:05,020 --> 04:07:07,020
I've learned the thing I want...

2837
04:07:07,020 --> 04:07:09,020
I most wanted to know.

2838
04:07:09,020 --> 04:07:11,020
And what's that?

2839
04:07:11,020 --> 04:07:13,020
When and how people get that mark.

2840
04:07:19,020 --> 04:07:21,020
The first time I was oblivious,

2841
04:07:21,020 --> 04:07:23,020
but this time,

2842
04:07:23,020 --> 04:07:25,020
I was aware of it.

2843
04:07:25,020 --> 04:07:27,020
Does he have it again?

2844
04:07:29,020 --> 04:07:31,020
Maschita, you don't mean...

2845
04:07:35,020 --> 04:07:37,020
He gives me his usual crooked smile.

2846
04:07:37,020 --> 04:07:39,020
Grannon shows me his wrist.

2847
04:07:39,020 --> 04:07:41,020
Sure enough, his skin is blemished by a scar

2848
04:07:41,020 --> 04:07:43,020
that looks like a spirit's bite mark.

2849
04:07:45,020 --> 04:07:47,020
Show cries out a look of horror on his face.

2850
04:07:47,020 --> 04:07:49,020
Come on, no way.

2851
04:07:49,020 --> 04:07:51,020
Do you seriously do that?

2852
04:07:53,020 --> 04:07:55,020
Man, give it up already.

2853
04:07:55,020 --> 04:07:57,020
It's someone else's problem, right?

2854
04:07:57,020 --> 04:07:59,020
So just shut it.

2855
04:08:01,020 --> 04:08:03,020
After everything.

2856
04:08:03,020 --> 04:08:05,020
After everything.

2857
04:08:05,020 --> 04:08:07,020
We did.

2858
04:08:07,020 --> 04:08:09,020
He's like, I got it again, just to see

2859
04:08:09,020 --> 04:08:11,020
how you get one.

2860
04:08:11,020 --> 04:08:13,020
Maschita, could I say something?

2861
04:08:13,020 --> 04:08:15,020
What's wrong?

2862
04:08:15,020 --> 04:08:17,020
What's wrong?

2863
04:08:17,020 --> 04:08:19,020
Nothing's wrong.

2864
04:08:19,020 --> 04:08:21,020
You never told me you had a gun.

2865
04:08:21,020 --> 04:08:23,020
Oh, that.

2866
04:08:23,020 --> 04:08:25,020
He laughs scornfully

2867
04:08:25,020 --> 04:08:27,020
and shoves a paper bag into my hands.

2868
04:08:27,020 --> 04:08:29,020
I open the bag and find

2869
04:08:29,020 --> 04:08:31,020
a revolver-style handgun

2870
04:08:31,020 --> 04:08:33,020
at the bottom.

2871
04:08:35,020 --> 04:08:37,020
If you want it taken.

2872
04:08:37,020 --> 04:08:39,020
That's not why I

2873
04:08:39,020 --> 04:08:41,020
Maschita keeps on talking

2874
04:08:41,020 --> 04:08:43,020
without stopping to hear what I have to say.

2875
04:08:43,020 --> 04:08:45,020
It's loaded with five bullets.

2876
04:08:45,020 --> 04:08:47,020
You can hang on to it.

2877
04:08:47,020 --> 04:08:49,020
I promise.

2878
04:08:49,020 --> 04:08:51,020
I promise you what.

2879
04:08:51,020 --> 04:08:53,020
Don't use it on anything other than a spirit.

2880
04:08:53,020 --> 04:08:55,020
Not that there's any proof

2881
04:08:55,020 --> 04:08:57,020
it will work on them.

2882
04:08:57,020 --> 04:08:59,020
We got a gun!

2883
04:09:01,020 --> 04:09:03,020
We, I think, I think

2884
04:09:03,020 --> 04:09:05,020
our main character

2885
04:09:05,020 --> 04:09:07,020
and he should kiss. Yes, I believe so.

2886
04:09:07,020 --> 04:09:09,020
No.

2887
04:09:13,020 --> 04:09:15,020
Of course.

2888
04:09:15,020 --> 04:09:17,020
I have any experience with guns.

2889
04:09:17,020 --> 04:09:19,020
There's no way I would.

2890
04:09:19,020 --> 04:09:21,020
To be fair,

2891
04:09:21,020 --> 04:09:23,020
I really, I don't really know.

2892
04:09:23,020 --> 04:09:25,020
But at the very least, right now,

2893
04:09:25,020 --> 04:09:27,020
I'm not getting the feeling that I can handle a gun.

2894
04:09:29,020 --> 04:09:31,020
But, MC is Senpai.

2895
04:09:31,020 --> 04:09:33,020
Well, Senpai, alternate route, okay?

2896
04:09:33,020 --> 04:09:35,020
This is like, uh, what is it?

2897
04:09:35,020 --> 04:09:37,020
Alternate reality, okay?

2898
04:09:37,020 --> 04:09:39,020
We can write fan fiction!

2899
04:09:43,020 --> 04:09:45,020
Oh.

2900
04:09:55,020 --> 04:09:57,020
Only use it under extreme stress.

2901
04:09:57,020 --> 04:09:59,020
With no experience, you will hit your mark.

2902
04:09:59,020 --> 04:10:01,020
Well, whatever. If I'm there,

2903
04:10:01,020 --> 04:10:03,020
just leave the shooting to me.

2904
04:10:03,020 --> 04:10:05,020
You can face the spirit some other way.

2905
04:10:05,020 --> 04:10:07,020
Yeah, that's how

2906
04:10:07,020 --> 04:10:09,020
it was in elementary two.

2907
04:10:13,020 --> 04:10:15,020
And for God's sake,

2908
04:10:15,020 --> 04:10:17,020
keep it.

2909
04:10:17,020 --> 04:10:19,020
Gun possession gets you three years

2910
04:10:19,020 --> 04:10:21,020
penal labor.

2911
04:10:21,020 --> 04:10:23,020
I'll get hit with one

2912
04:10:23,020 --> 04:10:25,020
to ten myself just for giving it to you.

2913
04:10:25,020 --> 04:10:27,020
And shooting a single bullet

2914
04:10:27,020 --> 04:10:29,020
will get you more than three years,

2915
04:10:29,020 --> 04:10:31,020
if not a life sentence.

2916
04:10:32,020 --> 04:10:34,020
Damn, gun laws in Japan, huh?

2917
04:10:39,020 --> 04:10:41,020
Is that how you're telling me not to use it?

2918
04:10:43,020 --> 04:10:45,020
No, I'm telling you that if it's restricted

2919
04:10:45,020 --> 04:10:47,020
that badly by the law,

2920
04:10:47,020 --> 04:10:49,020
it's got that kind of power.

2921
04:10:53,020 --> 04:10:55,020
Got a handgun.

2922
04:10:55,020 --> 04:10:57,020
Mark?

2923
04:10:57,020 --> 04:10:59,020
This color grows more vivid.

2924
04:10:59,020 --> 04:11:01,020
A few hours left

2925
04:11:01,020 --> 04:11:03,020
till death closes in.

2926
04:11:11,020 --> 04:11:13,020
Welcome back,

2927
04:11:13,020 --> 04:11:15,020
Lord Darling.

2928
04:11:15,020 --> 04:11:17,020
At least I can save now, yeah.

2929
04:11:17,020 --> 04:11:19,020
And I think,

2930
04:11:19,020 --> 04:11:21,020
I think we're good.

2931
04:11:21,020 --> 04:11:23,020
I think we're good.

2932
04:11:23,020 --> 04:11:25,020
I think we're good, Senpai.

2933
04:11:25,020 --> 04:11:27,020
That's a lot of excitement.

2934
04:11:27,020 --> 04:11:29,020
I think that's a good place to

2935
04:11:29,020 --> 04:11:31,020
to stop at. What do you think, Senpai?

2936
04:11:35,020 --> 04:11:37,020
You as well, Lord Cho.

2937
04:11:37,020 --> 04:11:39,020
It appears that the woman with you

2938
04:11:39,020 --> 04:11:41,020
is also a markbearer.

2939
04:11:45,020 --> 04:11:47,020
We introduce Christy

2940
04:11:47,020 --> 04:11:49,020
and then Mary.

2941
04:11:49,020 --> 04:11:51,020
Christy is to fill her in on everything.

2942
04:11:51,020 --> 04:11:53,020
Is this the first stream of this game?

2943
04:11:53,020 --> 04:11:55,020
Um, I have one more

2944
04:11:55,020 --> 04:11:57,020
one more

2945
04:11:57,020 --> 04:11:59,020
before this, where I kind of

2946
04:11:59,020 --> 04:12:01,020
yapped a lot more.

2947
04:12:01,020 --> 04:12:03,020
I yapped a whole lot.

2948
04:12:07,020 --> 04:12:09,020
A mark after your life.

2949
04:12:09,020 --> 04:12:11,020
Memory, loss,

2950
04:12:11,020 --> 04:12:13,020
and the spirits who curse them into the living.

2951
04:12:17,020 --> 04:12:19,020
Feels like a chapter just ended, right?

2952
04:12:21,020 --> 04:12:23,020
Christy accepts her new reality

2953
04:12:23,020 --> 04:12:25,020
surprisingly quickly. Guess it's only natural

2954
04:12:25,020 --> 04:12:27,020
after what she saw in the forest.

2955
04:12:27,020 --> 04:12:29,020
I then update Mary on what we found.

2956
04:12:31,020 --> 04:12:33,020
I see. What a close call

2957
04:12:33,020 --> 04:12:35,020
for you.

2958
04:12:35,020 --> 04:12:37,020
I can hear relief in her voice,

2959
04:12:37,020 --> 04:12:39,020
but why did she let Mashita go?

2960
04:12:39,020 --> 04:12:41,020
If you must know

2961
04:12:41,020 --> 04:12:43,020
after you left,

2962
04:12:43,020 --> 04:12:45,020
Lord Mashita insisted on traveling

2963
04:12:45,020 --> 04:12:47,020
to the forest as well.

2964
04:12:47,020 --> 04:12:49,020
Her eyes look over to Mashita.

2965
04:12:49,020 --> 04:12:51,020
I'm not

2966
04:12:51,020 --> 04:12:53,020
I'm not one to just sit around.

2967
04:12:53,020 --> 04:12:55,020
Mashita shrugs nonchalantly.

2968
04:12:57,020 --> 04:12:59,020
But there, yeah, though

2969
04:12:59,020 --> 04:13:01,020
there are one before this was mostly

2970
04:13:01,020 --> 04:13:03,020
me yapping and doing a bit

2971
04:13:03,020 --> 04:13:05,020
of the first chapter. We finished

2972
04:13:05,020 --> 04:13:07,020
the first chapter

2973
04:13:07,020 --> 04:13:09,020
in the stream and then we started the second

2974
04:13:09,020 --> 04:13:11,020
chapter. So we're still kind

2975
04:13:11,020 --> 04:13:13,020
of in the beginning of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2976
04:13:13,020 --> 04:13:15,020
Yeah.

2977
04:13:17,020 --> 04:13:19,020
I'm glad everyone's enjoying

2978
04:13:19,020 --> 04:13:21,020
this. I thought at first people would

2979
04:13:21,020 --> 04:13:23,020
find this kind of boring, but

2980
04:13:23,020 --> 04:13:25,020
but I'm glad that everyone's

2981
04:13:25,020 --> 04:13:27,020
like enjoying it now.

2982
04:13:33,020 --> 04:13:35,020
It was it was quite the issue.

2983
04:13:37,020 --> 04:13:39,020
A selfish attitude like that could

2984
04:13:39,020 --> 04:13:41,020
get all of you, Mark Barris killed.

2985
04:13:43,020 --> 04:13:45,020
I normally

2986
04:13:45,020 --> 04:13:47,020
would have refused.

2987
04:13:49,020 --> 04:13:51,020
Did something

2988
04:13:51,020 --> 04:13:53,020
happen? No.

2989
04:13:53,020 --> 04:13:55,020
I admit I had a foreboding

2990
04:13:55,020 --> 04:13:57,020
feeling. I sense danger

2991
04:13:57,020 --> 04:13:59,020
was closing in on you, Lord

2992
04:13:59,020 --> 04:14:01,020
Darling. So he went

2993
04:14:01,020 --> 04:14:03,020
an emergency measure.

2994
04:14:05,020 --> 04:14:07,020
Lord Mashita

2995
04:14:07,020 --> 04:14:09,020
please know I will not allow

2996
04:14:09,020 --> 04:14:11,020
such a thing a second time.

2997
04:14:11,020 --> 04:14:13,020
Her cool voice is spicier

2998
04:14:13,020 --> 04:14:15,020
than you. Mashita's

2999
04:14:15,020 --> 04:14:17,020
so hard headed. I wonder if she's actually getting

3000
04:14:17,020 --> 04:14:19,020
through to him at all.

3001
04:14:19,020 --> 04:14:21,020
Now, from what you've told me

3002
04:14:23,020 --> 04:14:25,020
you are positive that it was

3003
04:14:25,020 --> 04:14:27,020
Chimio who gave Lord Cho his mark.

3004
04:14:29,020 --> 04:14:31,020
Yeah, yeah

3005
04:14:31,020 --> 04:14:33,020
that ugly monster is definitely the

3006
04:14:33,020 --> 04:14:35,020
huge man I saw that time.

3007
04:14:35,020 --> 04:14:37,020
The fact that I have the mark

3008
04:14:37,020 --> 04:14:39,020
now to prove it.

3009
04:14:39,020 --> 04:14:41,020
Mashita rubs at its wrists

3010
04:14:41,020 --> 04:14:43,020
smirking.

3011
04:14:45,020 --> 04:14:47,020
So, what exactly

3012
04:14:47,020 --> 04:14:49,020
are you planning? Don't tell

3013
04:14:49,020 --> 04:14:51,020
me you're seriously thinking of fighting that thing.

3014
04:14:51,020 --> 04:14:53,020
There's no way you'd win.

3015
04:14:53,020 --> 04:14:55,020
You're completely mad if you think you can.

3016
04:14:57,020 --> 04:14:59,020
She's right. A certain someone awesome.

3017
04:14:59,020 --> 04:15:01,020
Someone's awesome bullet didn't

3018
04:15:01,020 --> 04:15:03,020
even scratch it. We need

3019
04:15:03,020 --> 04:15:05,020
a tank or something to beat that thing.

3020
04:15:09,020 --> 04:15:11,020
The room fall silent.

3021
04:15:17,020 --> 04:15:19,020
I'm sure all of us are thinking about what

3022
04:15:19,020 --> 04:15:21,020
we saw back at the forest.

3023
04:15:21,020 --> 04:15:23,020
I feel so bad for

3024
04:15:23,020 --> 04:15:25,020
Kimura.

3025
04:15:25,020 --> 04:15:27,020
There's no way we can do anything

3026
04:15:27,020 --> 04:15:29,020
about a monster like that.

3027
04:15:29,020 --> 04:15:31,020
You have to leave it to the police.

3028
04:15:33,020 --> 04:15:35,020
You honestly believe they'll do something.

3029
04:15:35,020 --> 04:15:37,020
Go

3030
04:15:37,020 --> 04:15:39,020
and make a suicide pack

3031
04:15:39,020 --> 04:15:41,020
with that naive thinking.

3032
04:15:41,020 --> 04:15:43,020
Believe me out of it.

3033
04:15:43,020 --> 04:15:45,020
What? How dare you?

3034
04:15:45,020 --> 04:15:47,020
No boss.

3035
04:15:47,020 --> 04:15:49,020
This is all high and mighty talk

3036
04:15:49,020 --> 04:15:51,020
coming from you? That mean

3037
04:15:51,020 --> 04:15:53,020
you got an idea how to beat it?

3038
04:15:53,020 --> 04:15:55,020
How the hell would

3039
04:15:55,020 --> 04:15:57,020
I know that?

3040
04:15:57,020 --> 04:15:59,020
When I'm willing to risk my life to find one.

3041
04:15:59,020 --> 04:16:01,020
The shout is

3042
04:16:01,020 --> 04:16:03,020
horse. Probably uneasy.

3043
04:16:03,020 --> 04:16:05,020
Christy shivers.

3044
04:16:05,020 --> 04:16:07,020
So it just glares up Machita.

3045
04:16:07,020 --> 04:16:09,020
Not where silence falls again.

3046
04:16:09,020 --> 04:16:11,020
What are the police going to do?

3047
04:16:11,020 --> 04:16:13,020
The police will just be like

3048
04:16:13,020 --> 04:16:15,020
yeah sure whatever.

3049
04:16:15,020 --> 04:16:17,020
Or die like the

3050
04:16:17,020 --> 04:16:19,020
the freaking

3051
04:16:19,020 --> 04:16:21,020
do you remember the

3052
04:16:21,020 --> 04:16:23,020
the guard?

3053
04:16:23,020 --> 04:16:25,020
Yeah probably not.

3054
04:16:27,020 --> 04:16:29,020
We're wasting

3055
04:16:29,020 --> 04:16:31,020
time. And Machita

3056
04:16:31,020 --> 04:16:33,020
is the police.

3057
04:16:33,020 --> 04:16:35,020
We've got to do something

3058
04:16:35,020 --> 04:16:37,020
but

3059
04:16:43,020 --> 04:16:45,020
What do we do

3060
04:16:45,020 --> 04:16:47,020
Senpai? Do we just

3061
04:16:47,020 --> 04:16:49,020
turn to Mary?

3062
04:16:53,020 --> 04:16:55,020
I'll turn to Mary. I'll be like

3063
04:16:57,020 --> 04:16:59,020
Take charge?

3064
04:17:01,020 --> 04:17:03,020
I don't know. I need more information.

3065
04:17:05,020 --> 04:17:07,020
You want to wear the pants

3066
04:17:07,020 --> 04:17:09,020
and take charge or let Mary handle it?

3067
04:17:09,020 --> 04:17:11,020
Well I want Mary's opinion.

3068
04:17:13,020 --> 04:17:15,020
Pull time? Be dummy?

3069
04:17:15,020 --> 04:17:17,020
No I don't want

3070
04:17:17,020 --> 04:17:19,020
We beat a ghost already. Okay

3071
04:17:19,020 --> 04:17:21,020
True.

3072
04:17:21,020 --> 04:17:23,020
True.

3073
04:17:23,020 --> 04:17:25,020
Maybe she can give us more hints.

3074
04:17:25,020 --> 04:17:27,020
I thought Mary could give us more

3075
04:17:27,020 --> 04:17:29,020
hints.

3076
04:17:31,020 --> 04:17:33,020
Show to us we're awesome.

3077
04:17:33,020 --> 04:17:35,020
Has he been wrong yet?

3078
04:17:37,020 --> 04:17:39,020
Being too reliant

3079
04:17:39,020 --> 04:17:41,020
will make us look weak. Okay fine.

3080
04:17:41,020 --> 04:17:43,020
Fine. Fine.

3081
04:17:43,020 --> 04:17:45,020
I saw majority B1 anyways.

3082
04:17:45,020 --> 04:17:47,020
Fine. Fine. We take charge.

3083
04:17:47,020 --> 04:17:49,020
Fuck it.

3084
04:17:49,020 --> 04:17:51,020
We need to force everyone into action.

3085
04:17:51,020 --> 04:17:53,020
You can think about what we need to do

3086
04:17:53,020 --> 04:17:55,020
while we're walking around.

3087
04:17:55,020 --> 04:17:57,020
Of course.

3088
04:17:57,020 --> 04:17:59,020
We need to take charge.

3089
04:17:59,020 --> 04:18:01,020
We're walking around.

3090
04:18:01,020 --> 04:18:03,020
Going back to the forest.

3091
04:18:05,020 --> 04:18:07,020
I want to learn more about Shemeal.

3092
04:18:07,020 --> 04:18:09,020
I could use some help.

3093
04:18:09,020 --> 04:18:11,020
You say that but

3094
04:18:11,020 --> 04:18:13,020
no way we can find a needle in a haystack.

3095
04:18:15,020 --> 04:18:17,020
Pants equipped.

3096
04:18:17,020 --> 04:18:19,020
We gotta have a clue first.

3097
04:18:23,020 --> 04:18:25,020
Then why don't we check out the B farm

3098
04:18:25,020 --> 04:18:27,020
that's north of H tribe?

3099
04:18:27,020 --> 04:18:29,020
My reports say several people have seen

3100
04:18:29,020 --> 04:18:31,020
Shemeal there.

3101
04:18:31,020 --> 04:18:33,020
Hardly anyone ever goes there now

3102
04:18:33,020 --> 04:18:35,020
with the weird events in the forest.

3103
04:18:35,020 --> 04:18:37,020
Why is a B farm up there?

3104
04:18:39,020 --> 04:18:41,020
A cult called Honey B Family

3105
04:18:41,020 --> 04:18:43,020
used to live on the land.

3106
04:18:43,020 --> 04:18:45,020
Oh my gosh! A cult!

3107
04:18:47,020 --> 04:18:49,020
No one's there though.

3108
04:18:49,020 --> 04:18:51,020
No one's there anymore though.

3109
04:18:51,020 --> 04:18:53,020
How come?

3110
04:18:53,020 --> 04:18:55,020
They

3111
04:18:55,020 --> 04:18:57,020
committed mass suicide.

3112
04:19:01,020 --> 04:19:03,020
Mass suicide in the woods.

3113
04:19:03,020 --> 04:19:05,020
I've heard about it somewhere.

3114
04:19:05,020 --> 04:19:07,020
It's always a cult, huh?

3115
04:19:07,020 --> 04:19:09,020
I should have mentioned something similar

3116
04:19:09,020 --> 04:19:11,020
before we entered the forest.

3117
04:19:13,020 --> 04:19:15,020
Shemeal is obviously a member.

3118
04:19:15,020 --> 04:19:17,020
Maybe the leader, perhaps?

3119
04:19:19,020 --> 04:19:21,020
Tabloids and gossip shows ate it

3120
04:19:21,020 --> 04:19:23,020
up five years ago.

3121
04:19:23,020 --> 04:19:25,020
I've never reviewed the details though,

3122
04:19:25,020 --> 04:19:27,020
so the public doesn't know.

3123
04:19:31,020 --> 04:19:33,020
Oh yeah, I remember that.

3124
04:19:33,020 --> 04:19:35,020
But my club took up all my time

3125
04:19:35,020 --> 04:19:37,020
back then, so I don't know much.

3126
04:19:39,020 --> 04:19:41,020
You seem to know quite a bit about the forest,

3127
04:19:41,020 --> 04:19:43,020
Christie Ari Mora.

3128
04:19:43,020 --> 04:19:45,020
Read up on it to find a Primo spot.

3129
04:19:47,020 --> 04:19:49,020
Don't be an ass.

3130
04:19:49,020 --> 04:19:51,020
I was put in charge of the report,

3131
04:19:51,020 --> 04:19:53,020
and the search.

3132
04:19:57,020 --> 04:19:59,020
Honeybee Family was very

3133
04:19:59,020 --> 04:20:01,020
insular and secretive.

3134
04:20:01,020 --> 04:20:03,020
I heard the mass suicide in

3135
04:20:03,020 --> 04:20:05,020
was all the members following their leader.

3136
04:20:05,020 --> 04:20:07,020
Nudes channels chalked it up

3137
04:20:07,020 --> 04:20:09,020
to their discontent with modern society.

3138
04:20:09,020 --> 04:20:11,020
What happened to the leader?

3139
04:20:11,020 --> 04:20:13,020
Rumors say it was also suicide.

3140
04:20:15,020 --> 04:20:17,020
Though, I saw an old picture of him in.

3141
04:20:17,020 --> 04:20:19,020
He was a huge,

3142
04:20:19,020 --> 04:20:21,020
obese man. It's him! It's him!

3143
04:20:21,020 --> 04:20:23,020
I called it!

3144
04:20:29,020 --> 04:20:31,020
Suddenly, everyone is holding their breath.

3145
04:20:31,020 --> 04:20:33,020
No doubt, we're picturing the same thing.

3146
04:20:35,020 --> 04:20:37,020
The monster at the forest entrance.

3147
04:20:39,020 --> 04:20:41,020
A dead guy's come back to life?

3148
04:20:45,020 --> 04:20:47,020
We want to go to a place

3149
04:20:47,020 --> 04:20:49,020
with a zombie? That's totally insane!

3150
04:20:51,020 --> 04:20:53,020
It's just like the rumors.

3151
04:20:53,020 --> 04:20:55,020
It's just like the rumors say that forest

3152
04:20:55,020 --> 04:20:57,020
is correct. There's no way I could

3153
04:20:57,020 --> 04:20:59,020
just standing there, the voices

3154
04:20:59,020 --> 04:21:01,020
of suicide victims surrounded me.

3155
04:21:01,020 --> 04:21:03,020
Shut the hell up, Hank!

3156
04:21:03,020 --> 04:21:05,020
No more words out of those

3157
04:21:05,020 --> 04:21:07,020
lip flaps!

3158
04:21:07,020 --> 04:21:09,020
Oh!

3159
04:21:15,020 --> 04:21:17,020
Why is he like this?

3160
04:21:25,020 --> 04:21:27,020
Why is he like this?

3161
04:21:27,020 --> 04:21:29,020
Rude.

3162
04:21:31,020 --> 04:21:33,020
But now it's not

3163
04:21:33,020 --> 04:21:35,020
only the forest thus cursed.

3164
04:21:35,020 --> 04:21:37,020
I failed to kill myself and now I'm in

3165
04:21:37,020 --> 04:21:39,020
this mansion. I'm cursed too.

3166
04:21:41,020 --> 04:21:43,020
And so all of

3167
04:21:43,020 --> 04:21:45,020
her mutters have a dark edge.

3168
04:21:47,020 --> 04:21:49,020
Shimeo is somehow connected to

3169
04:21:49,020 --> 04:21:51,020
Honey Bee family, and the key

3170
04:21:51,020 --> 04:21:53,020
to destroying his grudge is going to be there.

3171
04:21:55,020 --> 04:21:57,020
Alright, what are you going to do, old lady?

3172
04:21:57,020 --> 04:21:59,020
You still want to die?

3173
04:21:59,020 --> 04:22:01,020
I'm considering it.

3174
04:22:05,020 --> 04:22:07,020
Hahaha.

3175
04:22:07,020 --> 04:22:09,020
But I'll help you guys

3176
04:22:09,020 --> 04:22:11,020
while I settle on my decision.

3177
04:22:11,020 --> 04:22:13,020
I'll pass on monster fighting.

3178
04:22:15,020 --> 04:22:17,020
Well, you'll help. I'm shocked.

3179
04:22:21,020 --> 04:22:23,020
If you leave your mark alone,

3180
04:22:23,020 --> 04:22:25,020
you won't need to hike back out there.

3181
04:22:27,020 --> 04:22:29,020
Oh, I hate owning strangers.

3182
04:22:29,020 --> 04:22:31,020
Especially pushy guys like you.

3183
04:22:31,020 --> 04:22:33,020
He seems grateful that we saved her.

3184
04:22:35,020 --> 04:22:37,020
There's no reason to refuse her help.

3185
04:22:37,020 --> 04:22:39,020
We need as much as we can get.

3186
04:22:39,020 --> 04:22:41,020
She is pretty sane though.

3187
04:22:41,020 --> 04:22:43,020
Why is everyone in this game so negative?

3188
04:22:43,020 --> 04:22:45,020
Well, everyone's about to die.

3189
04:22:47,020 --> 04:22:49,020
You know, I think that's a pretty good reason.

3190
04:22:49,020 --> 04:22:51,020
Hahaha.

3191
04:23:01,020 --> 04:23:03,020
Lady Christy said Shimeo

3192
04:23:03,020 --> 04:23:05,020
was often seen near the bee farm.

3193
04:23:05,020 --> 04:23:07,020
It may hold a connection to him.

3194
04:23:07,020 --> 04:23:09,020
Good luck.

3195
04:23:15,020 --> 04:23:17,020
New info was added to the spirit file.

3196
04:23:17,020 --> 04:23:19,020
Temporary retreat.

3197
04:23:19,020 --> 04:23:21,020
Let's save some pie.

3198
04:23:23,020 --> 04:23:25,020
They do be having death hanging over their heads.

3199
04:23:31,020 --> 04:23:33,020
I can't remember how, but...

3200
04:23:35,020 --> 04:23:37,020
No, wait. Hold on.

3201
04:23:37,020 --> 04:23:39,020
How do I exit this? Any...

3202
04:23:39,020 --> 04:23:41,020
Hack it.

3203
04:23:41,020 --> 04:23:43,020
Hack it. I think it was...

3204
04:23:43,020 --> 04:23:45,020
X? No.

3205
04:23:45,020 --> 04:23:47,020
Y?

3206
04:23:47,020 --> 04:23:49,020
Yeah, here it is.

3207
04:23:49,020 --> 04:23:51,020
We got it!

3208
04:23:55,020 --> 04:23:57,020
If we turn to Tito's screen,

3209
04:23:57,020 --> 04:23:59,020
all unsaved progress will be lost.

3210
04:23:59,020 --> 04:24:01,020
We saved already, so we're good.

3211
04:24:11,020 --> 04:24:13,020
Yay!

3212
04:24:19,020 --> 04:24:21,020
Yay!

3213
04:24:21,020 --> 04:24:23,020
How was that, Senpai?

3214
04:24:23,020 --> 04:24:25,020
Are you enjoying the game now?

3215
04:24:25,020 --> 04:24:27,020
Hold on. Let me move myself. There we go.

3216
04:24:27,020 --> 04:24:29,020
Did you enjoy the game now?

3217
04:24:29,020 --> 04:24:31,020
Did you enjoy the game now?

3218
04:24:31,020 --> 04:24:33,020
And my chat box is broken.

3219
04:24:33,020 --> 04:24:35,020
And my chat box is broken.

3220
04:24:35,020 --> 04:24:37,020
Man.

3221
04:24:37,020 --> 04:24:39,020
Really fun, right? I'm so glad.

3222
04:24:39,020 --> 04:24:41,020
I know that it's kind of slow

3223
04:24:41,020 --> 04:24:43,020
I know that it's kind of slow

3224
04:24:43,020 --> 04:24:45,020
to start.

3225
04:24:45,020 --> 04:24:47,020
Because I know when I started,

3226
04:24:47,020 --> 04:24:49,020
I ended up yapping a lot.

3227
04:24:49,020 --> 04:24:51,020
But it really ramps up, right?

3228
04:24:51,020 --> 04:24:53,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3229
04:24:53,020 --> 04:24:55,020
So I'm glad that everyone's enjoying it.

3230
04:24:57,020 --> 04:24:59,020
So I hope...

3231
04:24:59,020 --> 04:25:01,020
Oh, and there's a sequel to this game, too.

3232
04:25:01,020 --> 04:25:03,020
So maybe we can

3233
04:25:03,020 --> 04:25:05,020
play the sequel

3234
04:25:05,020 --> 04:25:07,020
after we finish this one.

3235
04:25:07,020 --> 04:25:09,020
What do you think?

3236
04:25:09,020 --> 04:25:11,020
Oh my gosh, the Brooklyn Dacons!

3237
04:25:11,020 --> 04:25:13,020
Let's go!

3238
04:25:13,020 --> 04:25:15,020
The sequel, yeah, it's called...

3239
04:25:15,020 --> 04:25:17,020
Okay, so the series is called

3240
04:25:17,020 --> 04:25:19,020
Spirit Hunter.

3241
04:25:19,020 --> 04:25:21,020
This one is Deathmark.

3242
04:25:21,020 --> 04:25:23,020
The sequel is called No Good.

3243
04:25:23,020 --> 04:25:25,020
NG. Spirit Hunter...

3244
04:25:25,020 --> 04:25:27,020
Is it Spirit Hunter?

3245
04:25:27,020 --> 04:25:29,020
Shit.

3246
04:25:29,020 --> 04:25:31,020
Hold on.

3247
04:25:31,020 --> 04:25:33,020
Deathmark.

3248
04:25:33,020 --> 04:25:35,020
Spirit Hunter, yeah.

3249
04:25:35,020 --> 04:25:37,020
Spirit Hunter, the second game is called

3250
04:25:37,020 --> 04:25:39,020
Spirit Hunter NG.

3251
04:25:39,020 --> 04:25:41,020
No Good!

3252
04:25:41,020 --> 04:25:43,020
And there's going to be

3253
04:25:43,020 --> 04:25:45,020
another...

3254
04:25:45,020 --> 04:25:47,020
another one.

3255
04:25:47,020 --> 04:25:49,020
Another one following that.

3256
04:25:49,020 --> 04:25:51,020
That is releasing...

3257
04:25:51,020 --> 04:25:53,020
No.

3258
04:25:53,020 --> 04:25:55,020
It released already, right?

3259
04:25:55,020 --> 04:25:57,020
Spirit Hunter Deathmark 2.

3260
04:25:59,020 --> 04:26:01,020
Did it release already?

3261
04:26:01,020 --> 04:26:03,020
Tenpais, I don't remember.

3262
04:26:03,020 --> 04:26:05,020
I think it's already out, I think.

3263
04:26:05,020 --> 04:26:07,020
Okay, yeah.

3264
04:26:07,020 --> 04:26:09,020
There's another one that comes out.

3265
04:26:09,020 --> 04:26:11,020
Yeah.

3266
04:26:13,020 --> 04:26:15,020
Do you know when Deathmark came out?

3267
04:26:15,020 --> 04:26:17,020
Let me check.

3268
04:26:17,020 --> 04:26:19,020
It came out in both

3269
04:26:19,020 --> 04:26:21,020
English and Japanese

3270
04:26:21,020 --> 04:26:23,020
in April 2019.

3271
04:26:27,020 --> 04:26:29,020
It was apparent...

3272
04:26:29,020 --> 04:26:31,020
It was real 2019.

3273
04:26:31,020 --> 04:26:33,020
It was this one.

3274
04:26:33,020 --> 04:26:35,020
The second one came out in

3275
04:26:35,020 --> 04:26:37,020
2022, yeah.

3276
04:26:37,020 --> 04:26:39,020
And the latest one,

3277
04:26:39,020 --> 04:26:41,020
Deathmark...

3278
04:26:41,020 --> 04:26:43,020
Spirit Hunter Deathmark 2

3279
04:26:43,020 --> 04:26:45,020
came out

3280
04:26:45,020 --> 04:26:47,020
February 15, 2024.

3281
04:26:47,020 --> 04:26:49,020
Yeah.

3282
04:26:51,020 --> 04:26:53,020
So, uh...

3283
04:26:53,020 --> 04:26:55,020
Yeah,

3284
04:26:55,020 --> 04:26:57,020
they had to go into the

3285
04:26:57,020 --> 04:26:59,020
banger title.

3286
04:26:59,020 --> 04:27:01,020
So the game is practically

3287
04:27:01,020 --> 04:27:03,020
brand new, yeah.

3288
04:27:03,020 --> 04:27:05,020
I actually bought it

3289
04:27:05,020 --> 04:27:07,020
when it just came out.

3290
04:27:07,020 --> 04:27:09,020
I bought the original

3291
04:27:09,020 --> 04:27:11,020
limited edition

3292
04:27:11,020 --> 04:27:13,020
because I saw it in stores.

3293
04:27:13,020 --> 04:27:15,020
I saw it at GameStop

3294
04:27:15,020 --> 04:27:17,020
and I was like, yeah!

3295
04:27:17,020 --> 04:27:19,020
This looks cool! I love visual novels!

3296
04:27:19,020 --> 04:27:21,020
And so I bought it

3297
04:27:21,020 --> 04:27:23,020
for a PS4.

3298
04:27:23,020 --> 04:27:25,020
And then I got lazy...

3299
04:27:25,020 --> 04:27:27,020
I got lazy

3300
04:27:27,020 --> 04:27:29,020
and I wanted to stream it

3301
04:27:29,020 --> 04:27:31,020
but I didn't want to plug in my PS4!

3302
04:27:35,020 --> 04:27:37,020
I didn't want to...

3303
04:27:37,020 --> 04:27:39,020
So I bought it again on Steam!

3304
04:27:49,020 --> 04:27:51,020
I double-purchased it

3305
04:27:51,020 --> 04:27:53,020
because I was too lazy to plug it in!

3306
04:27:57,020 --> 04:27:59,020
But yeah, it's because I really wanted to...

3307
04:27:59,020 --> 04:28:01,020
What's the word? I really wanted

3308
04:28:01,020 --> 04:28:03,020
to...

3309
04:28:03,020 --> 04:28:05,020
play...

3310
04:28:05,020 --> 04:28:07,020
play it, but I was like, oh, I'm too lazy.

3311
04:28:07,020 --> 04:28:09,020
I'll probably stop being lazy

3312
04:28:09,020 --> 04:28:11,020
and...

3313
04:28:13,020 --> 04:28:15,020
actually plug in

3314
04:28:15,020 --> 04:28:17,020
my...

3315
04:28:17,020 --> 04:28:19,020
um...

3316
04:28:21,020 --> 04:28:23,020
my...

3317
04:28:25,020 --> 04:28:27,020
my systems?

3318
04:28:27,020 --> 04:28:29,020
My systems? Consoles?

3319
04:28:29,020 --> 04:28:31,020
Yeah, my consoles.

3320
04:28:33,020 --> 04:28:35,020
I bought it for PS4, yeah.

3321
04:28:35,020 --> 04:28:37,020
I don't... I don't have

3322
04:28:37,020 --> 04:28:39,020
the money

3323
04:28:39,020 --> 04:28:41,020
to pay for a PS5.

3324
04:28:43,020 --> 04:28:45,020
Actually, I was for a while

3325
04:28:45,020 --> 04:28:47,020
and I was like, why do I need a PS5?

3326
04:28:47,020 --> 04:28:49,020
And then now I'm just like, oh...

3327
04:28:49,020 --> 04:28:51,020
Well, it's kind of

3328
04:28:51,020 --> 04:28:53,020
backwards compatible, right?

3329
04:28:55,020 --> 04:28:57,020
Just say you're a super fan

3330
04:28:57,020 --> 04:28:59,020
and want to support the franchise even more.

3331
04:28:59,020 --> 04:29:01,020
Am I really a fan

3332
04:29:01,020 --> 04:29:03,020
if I never really played it to the end?

3333
04:29:07,020 --> 04:29:09,020
It's fine, the PS5 has no game.

3334
04:29:09,020 --> 04:29:11,020
Oh, but it's got like...

3335
04:29:11,020 --> 04:29:13,020
nice graphics.

3336
04:29:13,020 --> 04:29:15,020
Right?

3337
04:29:15,020 --> 04:29:17,020
It's got nice graphics.

3338
04:29:21,020 --> 04:29:23,020
And it's backwards and compatible,

3339
04:29:23,020 --> 04:29:25,020
so I thought that maybe

3340
04:29:25,020 --> 04:29:27,020
it would look prettier,

3341
04:29:27,020 --> 04:29:29,020
but I'm not sure

3342
04:29:29,020 --> 04:29:31,020
if it would look prettier at all...

3343
04:29:33,020 --> 04:29:35,020
at all for...

3344
04:29:37,020 --> 04:29:39,020
if it would make a difference,

3345
04:29:39,020 --> 04:29:41,020
you know, Senpai?

3346
04:29:44,020 --> 04:29:47,020
If I'm going to stream it through my PC,

3347
04:29:47,020 --> 04:29:49,020
I think it wouldn't

3348
04:29:49,020 --> 04:29:51,020
make that much of a difference, right?

3349
04:29:53,020 --> 04:29:55,020
At least, I don't think so.

3350
04:29:55,020 --> 04:29:57,020
Probably not, so that's why

3351
04:29:57,020 --> 04:29:59,020
in my mind I thought

3352
04:29:59,020 --> 04:30:01,020
um...

3353
04:30:01,020 --> 04:30:03,020
probably not, I probably...

3354
04:30:05,020 --> 04:30:07,020
I probably won't

3355
04:30:09,020 --> 04:30:11,020
won't get a PS5 yet.

3356
04:30:13,020 --> 04:30:15,020
It shouldn't be noticeable, yeah.

3357
04:30:15,020 --> 04:30:17,020
That's why I was like, okay, well,

3358
04:30:17,020 --> 04:30:19,020
if it's not going to improve the stream, I don't need it, right?

3359
04:30:23,020 --> 04:30:25,020
Everyone, PC is better.

3360
04:30:25,020 --> 04:30:27,020
Is your PC as strong as a PS5 though?

3361
04:30:33,020 --> 04:30:35,020
Yeah, PS5 isn't going anywhere

3362
04:30:35,020 --> 04:30:37,020
if you decide to want one later.

3363
04:30:37,020 --> 04:30:39,020
Yeah, I don't... they came out

3364
04:30:39,020 --> 04:30:41,020
of the slim, right?

3365
04:30:43,020 --> 04:30:45,020
Uh...

3366
04:30:45,020 --> 04:30:47,020
Came out the slim, which is slightly

3367
04:30:47,020 --> 04:30:49,020
cheaper, I think?

3368
04:30:57,020 --> 04:30:59,020
Um, right now, for my

3369
04:30:59,020 --> 04:31:01,020
PC, I'm using

3370
04:31:01,020 --> 04:31:03,020
uh...

3371
04:31:03,020 --> 04:31:05,020
an Xbox controller.

3372
04:31:05,020 --> 04:31:07,020
I have two Xbox controllers

3373
04:31:07,020 --> 04:31:09,020
and a PS4 controller,

3374
04:31:09,020 --> 04:31:11,020
a rose gold PS4 controller.

3375
04:31:14,020 --> 04:31:16,020
So, I don't know.

3376
04:31:22,020 --> 04:31:24,020
Um...

3377
04:31:24,020 --> 04:31:26,020
Yeah, I have the rose gold one.

3378
04:31:26,020 --> 04:31:27,020
I got it

3379
04:31:27,020 --> 04:31:29,020
when I was on sale.

3380
04:31:29,020 --> 04:31:31,020
Oh yeah,

3381
04:31:31,020 --> 04:31:33,020
Senpai, did you know that my first

3382
04:31:33,020 --> 04:31:35,020
home console was

3383
04:31:35,020 --> 04:31:37,020
a PS4?

3384
04:31:39,020 --> 04:31:41,020
My home... my first home console was a PS4.

3385
04:31:41,020 --> 04:31:43,020
Yeah, I think I told some Senpai's

3386
04:31:43,020 --> 04:31:45,020
earlier.

3387
04:31:45,020 --> 04:31:47,020
Yeah, like in a different stream.

3388
04:31:47,020 --> 04:31:49,020
I don't remember which stream, but I said...

3389
04:31:49,020 --> 04:31:51,020
My first console was a...

3390
04:31:51,020 --> 04:31:53,020
was a PS4.

3391
04:32:01,020 --> 04:32:03,020
Only handhelds before?

3392
04:32:03,020 --> 04:32:05,020
Yeah, my first handheld was

3393
04:32:05,020 --> 04:32:07,020
a DS... DS Lite, actually.

3394
04:32:07,020 --> 04:32:09,020
And then,

3395
04:32:09,020 --> 04:32:11,020
my second one

3396
04:32:11,020 --> 04:32:13,020
was...

3397
04:32:13,020 --> 04:32:15,020
a Vita?

3398
04:32:15,020 --> 04:32:17,020
Like a PS Vita?

3399
04:32:17,020 --> 04:32:19,020
And then...

3400
04:32:19,020 --> 04:32:21,020
And then I got a PSP,

3401
04:32:21,020 --> 04:32:23,020
finally.

3402
04:32:23,020 --> 04:32:25,020
Because it was on sale, because

3403
04:32:25,020 --> 04:32:27,020
PS Vita came out.

3404
04:32:27,020 --> 04:32:29,020
And then...

3405
04:32:31,020 --> 04:32:33,020
Honestly,

3406
04:32:33,020 --> 04:32:35,020
the Vita was so good, that thing never

3407
04:32:35,020 --> 04:32:37,020
died on me. That thing never died.

3408
04:32:37,020 --> 04:32:39,020
I left it for months, and it still had

3409
04:32:39,020 --> 04:32:41,020
70% batteries. Holy shit.

3410
04:32:45,020 --> 04:32:47,020
That was really good. That thing was good.

3411
04:32:47,020 --> 04:32:49,020
I have the...

3412
04:32:51,020 --> 04:32:53,020
the first gen of the PS Vita,

3413
04:32:53,020 --> 04:32:55,020
so it's super good.

3414
04:32:55,020 --> 04:32:57,020
It's got the beautiful screen.

3415
04:32:59,020 --> 04:33:01,020
They updated the screen to be

3416
04:33:01,020 --> 04:33:03,020
a lower quality, so it's had a lower price.

3417
04:33:03,020 --> 04:33:05,020
But like the first one? Yeah, the OLED.

3418
04:33:05,020 --> 04:33:07,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have that one.

3419
04:33:07,020 --> 04:33:09,020
That was my second one, because

3420
04:33:09,020 --> 04:33:11,020
it came out, and

3421
04:33:11,020 --> 04:33:13,020
I saw the color, it was white,

3422
04:33:13,020 --> 04:33:15,020
and I was like, oh, pretty!

3423
04:33:15,020 --> 04:33:17,020
That's why I got it!

3424
04:33:21,020 --> 04:33:23,020
So I got it, and I thought it was so nice.

3425
04:33:23,020 --> 04:33:25,020
It came with, um...

3426
04:33:25,020 --> 04:33:27,020
Assassin's Creed Liberation, I think.

3427
04:33:29,020 --> 04:33:31,020
It's also great

3428
04:33:31,020 --> 04:33:33,020
when you connect it to the PS4,

3429
04:33:33,020 --> 04:33:35,020
because it acts like another screen

3430
04:33:35,020 --> 04:33:37,020
and another controller. It's really great.

3431
04:33:37,020 --> 04:33:39,020
I don't know, I loved it. I loved it a lot.

3432
04:33:39,020 --> 04:33:41,020
I feel bad that it didn't take off.

3433
04:33:45,020 --> 04:33:47,020
She showed us a picture one day.

3434
04:33:47,020 --> 04:33:49,020
Yeah, I have, um...

3435
04:33:49,020 --> 04:33:51,020
I have some systems,

3436
04:33:51,020 --> 04:33:53,020
but now a friend of mine,

3437
04:33:53,020 --> 04:33:55,020
like one of my gal pals,

3438
04:33:55,020 --> 04:33:57,020
was decluttering.

3439
04:33:57,020 --> 04:33:59,020
And she was like,

3440
04:33:59,020 --> 04:34:01,020
hey,

3441
04:34:01,020 --> 04:34:03,020
you're streaming now, right?

3442
04:34:03,020 --> 04:34:05,020
And I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm streaming now.

3443
04:34:05,020 --> 04:34:07,020
I'm doing streaming stuff.

3444
04:34:07,020 --> 04:34:09,020
And she was like, I have

3445
04:34:09,020 --> 04:34:11,020
all these old consoles.

3446
04:34:11,020 --> 04:34:13,020
I don't need this anymore.

3447
04:34:13,020 --> 04:34:15,020
Do you want them? And so I inherited

3448
04:34:15,020 --> 04:34:17,020
her entire collection.

3449
04:34:17,020 --> 04:34:19,020
And I'm super thankful.

3450
04:34:23,020 --> 04:34:25,020
So I got

3451
04:34:25,020 --> 04:34:27,020
basically every console

3452
04:34:27,020 --> 04:34:29,020
basically

3453
04:34:29,020 --> 04:34:31,020
every console now.

3454
04:34:33,020 --> 04:34:35,020
Are you planning to get a 3DS

3455
04:34:35,020 --> 04:34:37,020
capture card for SMT4?

3456
04:34:37,020 --> 04:34:39,020
I don't know.

3457
04:34:39,020 --> 04:34:41,020
The guy who did like

3458
04:34:41,020 --> 04:34:43,020
DS capture stuff

3459
04:34:43,020 --> 04:34:45,020
doesn't make them anymore, right?

3460
04:34:47,020 --> 04:34:49,020
Sounds like a real homie.

3461
04:34:49,020 --> 04:34:51,020
I hope she gets good things in life. Yeah!

3462
04:34:51,020 --> 04:34:53,020
Is Mercy going to be a

3463
04:34:53,020 --> 04:34:55,020
retro slash nostalgia streamer then?

3464
04:34:55,020 --> 04:34:57,020
I'm hoping

3465
04:34:57,020 --> 04:34:59,020
I can play some games.

3466
04:34:59,020 --> 04:35:01,020
I ordered a retro tank.

3467
04:35:01,020 --> 04:35:03,020
Thank you, Senpai,

3468
04:35:03,020 --> 04:35:05,020
who crowdfunded that.

3469
04:35:05,020 --> 04:35:07,020
Thank you so much.

3470
04:35:07,020 --> 04:35:09,020
I ordered the retro tank already,

3471
04:35:09,020 --> 04:35:11,020
so it should arrive.

3472
04:35:11,020 --> 04:35:13,020
It's still kind of like processing,

3473
04:35:13,020 --> 04:35:15,020
but when it arrives,

3474
04:35:15,020 --> 04:35:17,020
I really want

3475
04:35:17,020 --> 04:35:19,020
to play.

3476
04:35:19,020 --> 04:35:21,020
I really want to play

3477
04:35:21,020 --> 04:35:23,020
on the Wii.

3478
04:35:25,020 --> 04:35:27,020
On the Wii.

3479
04:35:27,020 --> 04:35:29,020
No more heroes,

3480
04:35:29,020 --> 04:35:31,020
so I can use

3481
04:35:31,020 --> 04:35:33,020
the Wii remote.

3482
04:35:37,020 --> 04:35:39,020
It has the speaker.

3483
04:35:39,020 --> 04:35:41,020
I heard you can use it as

3484
04:35:41,020 --> 04:35:43,020
like a phone.

3485
04:35:43,020 --> 04:35:45,020
And you can hear the voices

3486
04:35:45,020 --> 04:35:47,020
go through the Wii

3487
04:35:47,020 --> 04:35:49,020
remote speaker. And I think that's real cool.

3488
04:35:49,020 --> 04:35:51,020
I think that's really cool.

3489
04:35:53,020 --> 04:35:55,020
So, that's something

3490
04:35:55,020 --> 04:35:57,020
I want to play. I also have

3491
04:35:57,020 --> 04:35:59,020
a bunch of PS2 games that

3492
04:35:59,020 --> 04:36:01,020
I want to play as well.

3493
04:36:01,020 --> 04:36:03,020
And I think it would be just really

3494
04:36:03,020 --> 04:36:05,020
fun.

3495
04:36:05,020 --> 04:36:07,020
And so

3496
04:36:07,020 --> 04:36:09,020
I thought this...

3497
04:36:09,020 --> 04:36:11,020
I googled it to see how I can capture

3498
04:36:15,020 --> 04:36:17,020
capture the

3499
04:36:17,020 --> 04:36:19,020
the consoles without

3500
04:36:19,020 --> 04:36:21,020
like too much equipment.

3501
04:36:21,020 --> 04:36:23,020
And so I found the retro tank

3502
04:36:23,020 --> 04:36:25,020
and then I was like, oh, it's

3503
04:36:25,020 --> 04:36:27,020
kind of expensive.

3504
04:36:27,020 --> 04:36:29,020
Maybe I'll put it on my list and maybe

3505
04:36:29,020 --> 04:36:31,020
we can crowdfund it together so

3506
04:36:31,020 --> 04:36:33,020
I can give more stuff

3507
04:36:33,020 --> 04:36:35,020
to show more stuff

3508
04:36:35,020 --> 04:36:37,020
to

3509
04:36:37,020 --> 04:36:39,020
to senpais. And I would be able to play

3510
04:36:39,020 --> 04:36:41,020
things on original hardware.

3511
04:36:41,020 --> 04:36:43,020
So I would love that.

3512
04:36:43,020 --> 04:36:45,020
I would love to do that.

3513
04:36:47,020 --> 04:36:49,020
So, yeah.

3514
04:36:49,020 --> 04:36:51,020
The Wii is retro?

3515
04:36:51,020 --> 04:36:53,020
How old is the Wii? It should be retro, right?

3516
04:37:05,020 --> 04:37:07,020
The Wii came out in 2006,

3517
04:37:07,020 --> 04:37:09,020
Senpai.

3518
04:37:17,020 --> 04:37:19,020
That's like...

3519
04:37:23,020 --> 04:37:25,020
I forget what year it is.

3520
04:37:25,020 --> 04:37:27,020
What year is it? 2024.

3521
04:37:35,020 --> 04:37:37,020
I can't math.

3522
04:37:37,020 --> 04:37:39,020
It's 18 years old.

3523
04:37:39,020 --> 04:37:41,020
It's legal.

3524
04:37:41,020 --> 04:37:43,020
It's an adult now.

3525
04:37:43,020 --> 04:37:45,020
Okay, Senpai.

3526
04:37:51,020 --> 04:37:53,020
Why did you bait yourself

3527
04:37:53,020 --> 04:37:55,020
into doing math, Mercy? It's because

3528
04:37:55,020 --> 04:37:57,020
I want to prove that it's...

3529
04:37:57,020 --> 04:37:59,020
I hate math,

3530
04:37:59,020 --> 04:38:01,020
but I want to prove that it's

3531
04:38:01,020 --> 04:38:03,020
uh...

3532
04:38:05,020 --> 04:38:07,020
It's uh...

3533
04:38:07,020 --> 04:38:09,020
It's old.

3534
04:38:13,020 --> 04:38:15,020
So...

3535
04:38:25,020 --> 04:38:27,020
Wii is officially legal. Like as an adult

3536
04:38:27,020 --> 04:38:29,020
it's officially like a legal adult, right?

3537
04:38:31,020 --> 04:38:33,020
Um...

3538
04:38:33,020 --> 04:38:35,020
Yeah, so I would love to play like

3539
04:38:35,020 --> 04:38:37,020
PS2 games.

3540
04:38:37,020 --> 04:38:39,020
And...

3541
04:38:39,020 --> 04:38:41,020
I also have like an Xbox.

3542
04:38:41,020 --> 04:38:43,020
I think it's the 360?

3543
04:38:43,020 --> 04:38:45,020
Anyways, I have like so many,

3544
04:38:45,020 --> 04:38:47,020
so many like consoles now.

3545
04:38:47,020 --> 04:38:49,020
I have like SNES.

3546
04:38:51,020 --> 04:38:53,020
I don't think I have a Genesis though.

3547
04:38:53,020 --> 04:38:55,020
I have to check.

3548
04:38:55,020 --> 04:38:57,020
Wait, or maybe I do.

3549
04:38:57,020 --> 04:38:59,020
Oh well, I have like so many.

3550
04:38:59,020 --> 04:39:01,020
I have so many like consoles now

3551
04:39:01,020 --> 04:39:03,020
and I would love to play.

3552
04:39:03,020 --> 04:39:05,020
Just this collection after all.

3553
04:39:05,020 --> 04:39:07,020
It's um...

3554
04:39:11,020 --> 04:39:13,020
It's uh...

3555
04:39:13,020 --> 04:39:15,020
Like my friend gave it to me, right?

3556
04:39:15,020 --> 04:39:17,020
Like she gave it to me.

3557
04:39:17,020 --> 04:39:19,020
That's so nice!

3558
04:39:23,020 --> 04:39:25,020
So that's why I'm just like

3559
04:39:25,020 --> 04:39:27,020
well...

3560
04:39:27,020 --> 04:39:29,020
It was so kind.

3561
04:39:29,020 --> 04:39:31,020
She was so kind enough

3562
04:39:31,020 --> 04:39:33,020
to give it to me, so I should probably

3563
04:39:33,020 --> 04:39:35,020
you know...

3564
04:39:35,020 --> 04:39:37,020
I should probably

3565
04:39:37,020 --> 04:39:39,020
play it, right?

3566
04:39:41,020 --> 04:39:43,020
Like I have so many games now.

3567
04:39:43,020 --> 04:39:45,020
Like so many!

3568
04:39:49,020 --> 04:39:51,020
SNES threatening in some way.

3569
04:39:51,020 --> 04:39:53,020
What do you mean?

3570
04:39:53,020 --> 04:39:55,020
Damn, is your friend single?

3571
04:40:01,020 --> 04:40:03,020
I'm pie.

3572
04:40:03,020 --> 04:40:05,020
I'm pie. Please only look at me.

3573
04:40:11,020 --> 04:40:13,020
Please only look at me, Senpai.

3574
04:40:15,020 --> 04:40:17,020
Please only look at me, Senpai.

3575
04:40:21,020 --> 04:40:23,020
I would greatly appreciate you

3576
04:40:23,020 --> 04:40:25,020
not...

3577
04:40:25,020 --> 04:40:27,020
not moving your eyes

3578
04:40:27,020 --> 04:40:29,020
to someone else.

3579
04:40:29,020 --> 04:40:31,020
Okay?

3580
04:40:35,020 --> 04:40:37,020
I think you need

3581
04:40:37,020 --> 04:40:39,020
some time alone in a barrel.

3582
04:40:39,020 --> 04:40:41,020
Six feet under.

3583
04:40:59,020 --> 04:41:01,020
Oh, they get a breathing tube at least?

3584
04:41:01,020 --> 04:41:03,020
No.

3585
04:41:09,020 --> 04:41:11,020
I'm about to play

3586
04:41:11,020 --> 04:41:13,020
all these nice games

3587
04:41:13,020 --> 04:41:15,020
for Senpais.

3588
04:41:15,020 --> 04:41:17,020
And this is how you treat me?

3589
04:41:17,020 --> 04:41:19,020
Damn!

3590
04:41:23,020 --> 04:41:25,020
Anyways...

3591
04:41:25,020 --> 04:41:27,020
Senpais, ignoring that Senpai.

3592
04:41:31,020 --> 04:41:33,020
Um...

3593
04:41:33,020 --> 04:41:35,020
I think it'll be great

3594
04:41:35,020 --> 04:41:37,020
to play like all these games.

3595
04:41:37,020 --> 04:41:39,020
I want to go through

3596
04:41:39,020 --> 04:41:41,020
my collection of games

3597
04:41:41,020 --> 04:41:43,020
before I

3598
04:41:43,020 --> 04:41:45,020
go through

3599
04:41:45,020 --> 04:41:47,020
any...

3600
04:41:47,020 --> 04:41:49,020
any other...

3601
04:41:49,020 --> 04:41:51,020
any other newer games.

3602
04:41:51,020 --> 04:41:53,020
Unless...

3603
04:41:53,020 --> 04:41:55,020
you know, SMT

3604
04:41:55,020 --> 04:41:57,020
5

3605
04:41:57,020 --> 04:41:59,020
Vengeance

3606
04:41:59,020 --> 04:42:01,020
looking pretty nice right now.

3607
04:42:01,020 --> 04:42:03,020
But I don't want to play it.

3608
04:42:03,020 --> 04:42:05,020
I have to play the

3609
04:42:05,020 --> 04:42:07,020
first one,

3610
04:42:07,020 --> 04:42:09,020
the SMT 5,

3611
04:42:09,020 --> 04:42:11,020
which gives me motion sickness, so I have to take my pills

3612
04:42:11,020 --> 04:42:13,020
or something.

3613
04:42:15,020 --> 04:42:17,020
Vengeance is out. I know!

3614
04:42:17,020 --> 04:42:19,020
I see all these, like,

3615
04:42:19,020 --> 04:42:21,020
screenshots and I'm like,

3616
04:42:21,020 --> 04:42:23,020
it's looking kind of...

3617
04:42:23,020 --> 04:42:25,020
It's looking really great. It looks really great.

3618
04:42:35,020 --> 04:42:37,020
Vengeance is basically 5,

3619
04:42:37,020 --> 04:42:39,020
but better. I mean...

3620
04:42:39,020 --> 04:42:41,020
Uh, yeah, it's...

3621
04:42:43,020 --> 04:42:45,020
Does Minecraft activate your motion sickness?

3622
04:42:45,020 --> 04:42:47,020
Yeah, it does.

3623
04:42:47,020 --> 04:42:49,020
Like, anything kind of first person

3624
04:42:49,020 --> 04:42:51,020
often

3625
04:42:51,020 --> 04:42:53,020
activates the

3626
04:42:53,020 --> 04:42:55,020
the motion sickness. And you know what?

3627
04:42:55,020 --> 04:42:57,020
What is also?

3628
04:42:57,020 --> 04:42:59,020
Um...

3629
04:42:59,020 --> 04:43:01,020
It's not a sequel to 5,

3630
04:43:01,020 --> 04:43:03,020
just an updated version? Seriously?

3631
04:43:05,020 --> 04:43:07,020
I thought it was a sequel

3632
04:43:07,020 --> 04:43:09,020
because it's...

3633
04:43:09,020 --> 04:43:11,020
because it's Apocalypse, right? So...

3634
04:43:11,020 --> 04:43:13,020
SMT 4

3635
04:43:13,020 --> 04:43:15,020
Apocalypse was a completely different cast.

3636
04:43:21,020 --> 04:43:23,020
It's like a completely different cast.

3637
04:43:23,020 --> 04:43:25,020
Like, you play as a completely different character

3638
04:43:25,020 --> 04:43:27,020
and everything.

3639
04:43:27,020 --> 04:43:29,020
It's like Persona 5 Royale

3640
04:43:29,020 --> 04:43:31,020
is an updated

3641
04:43:31,020 --> 04:43:33,020
P5. Seriously?

3642
04:43:35,020 --> 04:43:37,020
Um...

3643
04:43:37,020 --> 04:43:39,020
But I thought it said

3644
04:43:39,020 --> 04:43:41,020
Apocalypse with it!

3645
04:43:41,020 --> 04:43:43,020
But the subtitle

3646
04:43:43,020 --> 04:43:45,020
was also like Apocalypse

3647
04:43:45,020 --> 04:43:47,020
and I thought all of the sequels

3648
04:43:47,020 --> 04:43:49,020
were like Apocalypse.

3649
04:43:49,020 --> 04:43:51,020
Vengeance is just an update?

3650
04:43:51,020 --> 04:43:53,020
Huh...

3651
04:43:59,020 --> 04:44:01,020
Because like,

3652
04:44:01,020 --> 04:44:03,020
SMT 5 made me, like, throw up.

3653
04:44:06,020 --> 04:44:08,020
Made me throw up.

3654
04:44:08,020 --> 04:44:10,020
And another game that

3655
04:44:10,020 --> 04:44:12,020
surprisingly also makes me throw up is Sonic.

3656
04:44:12,020 --> 04:44:14,020
And all Sonic games also

3657
04:44:14,020 --> 04:44:16,020
has like...

3658
04:44:21,020 --> 04:44:23,020
has like, lots of motion

3659
04:44:23,020 --> 04:44:25,020
and like, screen shakes

3660
04:44:25,020 --> 04:44:27,020
that I was like...

3661
04:44:29,020 --> 04:44:31,020
So there's a lot of games that makes me go

3662
04:44:31,020 --> 04:44:33,020
ugh...

3663
04:44:34,020 --> 04:44:36,020
So can you do FPS?

3664
04:44:36,020 --> 04:44:37,020
Uh...

3665
04:44:37,020 --> 04:44:39,020
First person shooter?

3666
04:44:39,020 --> 04:44:41,020
First person?

3667
04:44:45,020 --> 04:44:47,020
So yeah, that's probably...

3668
04:44:47,020 --> 04:44:49,020
something that makes me going

3669
04:44:49,020 --> 04:44:51,020
ugh...

3670
04:44:51,020 --> 04:44:53,020
ugh...

3671
04:44:53,020 --> 04:44:55,020
Mercy throwing upstream?

3672
04:44:55,020 --> 04:44:57,020
Well, at least throwing up is allowed on YouTube.

3673
04:44:57,020 --> 04:44:59,020
On...

3674
04:44:59,020 --> 04:45:01,020
on Twitch, you would be banned for that.

3675
04:45:02,020 --> 04:45:04,020
They banned it!

3676
04:45:06,020 --> 04:45:08,020
Against TOS?

3677
04:45:10,020 --> 04:45:12,020
Yeah, only third person games, realistically.

3678
04:45:12,020 --> 04:45:14,020
Um, Strani did say

3679
04:45:14,020 --> 04:45:17,020
I should expand my gaming repertoire.

3680
04:45:17,020 --> 04:45:19,020
So...

3681
04:45:19,020 --> 04:45:21,020
I'm willing to try

3682
04:45:21,020 --> 04:45:23,020
basically all games.

3683
04:45:31,020 --> 04:45:33,020
Twitch bans you for getting sick?

3684
04:45:33,020 --> 04:45:35,020
Um, and you...

3685
04:45:35,020 --> 04:45:37,020
It's because...

3686
04:45:38,020 --> 04:45:40,020
I believe it's because...

3687
04:45:40,020 --> 04:45:42,020
Okay, okay.

3688
04:45:42,020 --> 04:45:44,020
This is like a story that I think I heard.

3689
04:45:44,020 --> 04:45:46,020
This is the reason why, but I could be wrong.

3690
04:45:47,020 --> 04:45:49,020
But I remember it's because

3691
04:45:49,020 --> 04:45:51,020
someone was

3692
04:45:51,020 --> 04:45:53,020
doing some kind of fetish thing

3693
04:45:53,020 --> 04:45:55,020
where they were throwing up.

3694
04:45:55,020 --> 04:45:57,020
And it was like, pretty dangerous.

3695
04:45:57,020 --> 04:45:59,020
And it was encouraging, like, you know...

3696
04:45:59,020 --> 04:46:01,020
Um...

3697
04:46:01,020 --> 04:46:03,020
Like, it was like...

3698
04:46:03,020 --> 04:46:05,020
doing some fetish thing

3699
04:46:05,020 --> 04:46:07,020
where people were paying them

3700
04:46:07,020 --> 04:46:09,020
to throw up.

3701
04:46:09,020 --> 04:46:11,020
So...

3702
04:46:11,020 --> 04:46:13,020
to take action against that,

3703
04:46:13,020 --> 04:46:15,020
um...

3704
04:46:15,020 --> 04:46:17,020
Twitch was like, okay, you cannot throw

3705
04:46:17,020 --> 04:46:19,020
up on stream then.

3706
04:46:21,020 --> 04:46:23,020
Ahem.

3707
04:46:30,020 --> 04:46:32,020
Hey, Mercy, if you were chill

3708
04:46:32,020 --> 04:46:34,020
with all visual novels out,

3709
04:46:34,020 --> 04:46:36,020
it would be fine too. Um...

3710
04:46:36,020 --> 04:46:38,020
Mostly it was like the point-and-click stuff.

3711
04:46:38,020 --> 04:46:40,020
She was like, I need you to...

3712
04:46:40,020 --> 04:46:42,020
I need you to try more games.

3713
04:46:42,020 --> 04:46:44,020
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I can do that.

3714
04:46:44,020 --> 04:46:46,020
I can do that.

3715
04:46:47,020 --> 04:46:49,020
Is this like the girl

3716
04:46:49,020 --> 04:46:51,020
bottling her farts and getting sick?

3717
04:46:51,020 --> 04:46:53,020
Probably.

3718
04:46:53,020 --> 04:46:55,020
I don't know.

3719
04:46:55,020 --> 04:46:57,020
Would you play

3720
04:46:57,020 --> 04:46:59,020
other games like SMT Devil Survivor

3721
04:46:59,020 --> 04:47:01,020
or Fire Emblem?

3722
04:47:01,020 --> 04:47:03,020
I don't like Devil Survivor.

3723
04:47:03,020 --> 04:47:05,020
I played it on the DS. I have it for the DS.

3724
04:47:05,020 --> 04:47:07,020
I don't like Devil Survivor.

3725
04:47:07,020 --> 04:47:09,020
I just don't like the gameplay mechanic

3726
04:47:09,020 --> 04:47:11,020
of it.

3727
04:47:11,020 --> 04:47:13,020
I did like, uh, what's the one again

3728
04:47:13,020 --> 04:47:15,020
where they have all the massive stuff?

3729
04:47:15,020 --> 04:47:17,020
I don't know, what was the call again?

3730
04:47:19,020 --> 04:47:21,020
Uh...

3731
04:47:27,020 --> 04:47:29,020
Strange Journey.

3732
04:47:29,020 --> 04:47:31,020
Yes, I like Strange Journey though.

3733
04:47:31,020 --> 04:47:33,020
I like Strange Journey.

3734
04:47:35,020 --> 04:47:37,020
And I did like what I played

3735
04:47:37,020 --> 04:47:39,020
for the PS2

3736
04:47:39,020 --> 04:47:41,020
of what I played.

3737
04:47:41,020 --> 04:47:43,020
Did you know Devil Saga

3738
04:47:43,020 --> 04:47:45,020
was good too?

3739
04:47:49,020 --> 04:47:51,020
Uh...

3740
04:47:51,020 --> 04:47:53,020
Strange Journey or Archie and Noah

3741
04:47:53,020 --> 04:47:55,020
are redux. I liked

3742
04:47:55,020 --> 04:47:57,020
both, but I own redux

3743
04:47:57,020 --> 04:47:59,020
and I had to borrow from a friend

3744
04:47:59,020 --> 04:48:01,020
the original Strange Journey.

3745
04:48:03,020 --> 04:48:05,020
Um...

3746
04:48:05,020 --> 04:48:07,020
I didn't like the

3747
04:48:07,020 --> 04:48:09,020
the gameplay mechanics of

3748
04:48:11,020 --> 04:48:13,020
of, uh...

3749
04:48:13,020 --> 04:48:15,020
uh...

3750
04:48:15,020 --> 04:48:17,020
Devil Survivor though. I didn't like that one.

3751
04:48:19,020 --> 04:48:21,020
I just, I know, I know it's like

3752
04:48:21,020 --> 04:48:23,020
people were like, oh well, whatever.

3753
04:48:23,020 --> 04:48:25,020
I just didn't like the like tiles.

3754
04:48:25,020 --> 04:48:27,020
I didn't like it.

3755
04:48:31,020 --> 04:48:33,020
So, that's why I was kind of like

3756
04:48:33,020 --> 04:48:35,020
ehh, no, no thanks.

3757
04:48:37,020 --> 04:48:39,020
Uh, it felt like

3758
04:48:39,020 --> 04:48:41,020
a tactics game and like a,

3759
04:48:41,020 --> 04:48:43,020
you know, like one of those chess tactic games

3760
04:48:43,020 --> 04:48:45,020
or like...

3761
04:48:45,020 --> 04:48:47,020
Uh, like, I'm gonna get,

3762
04:48:47,020 --> 04:48:49,020
I'm gonna get fricking fried for this,

3763
04:48:49,020 --> 04:48:51,020
but I'm not a huge fan of Fire Emblem

3764
04:48:51,020 --> 04:48:53,020
because of like, its chess

3765
04:48:53,020 --> 04:48:55,020
like, tile mechanics.

3766
04:48:57,020 --> 04:48:59,020
Because I was like, uh...

3767
04:48:59,020 --> 04:49:01,020
I don't know.

3768
04:49:01,020 --> 04:49:03,020
Kind of boring.

3769
04:49:05,020 --> 04:49:07,020
It was kind of boring.

3770
04:49:07,020 --> 04:49:09,020
I mean, maybe I'll give it another go,

3771
04:49:09,020 --> 04:49:11,020
but when I played it,

3772
04:49:11,020 --> 04:49:13,020
I didn't like it.

3773
04:49:17,020 --> 04:49:19,020
Like, uh...

3774
04:49:19,020 --> 04:49:21,020
I also, I remember trying to stream

3775
04:49:23,020 --> 04:49:25,020
um...

3776
04:49:27,020 --> 04:49:29,020
Fire Emblem, which one is it? Three Houses?

3777
04:49:29,020 --> 04:49:31,020
And I just could not

3778
04:49:31,020 --> 04:49:33,020
make it entertaining.

3779
04:49:33,020 --> 04:49:35,020
I just could not make it entertaining.

3780
04:49:35,020 --> 04:49:37,020
I mean, I tried.

3781
04:49:37,020 --> 04:49:39,020
Really hard.

3782
04:49:41,020 --> 04:49:43,020
So, yeah.

3783
04:49:45,020 --> 04:49:47,020
I just didn't like the tiles.

3784
04:49:47,020 --> 04:49:49,020
I was like, uh...

3785
04:49:49,020 --> 04:49:51,020
Maybe...

3786
04:49:51,020 --> 04:49:53,020
Maybe I can try it again later,

3787
04:49:53,020 --> 04:49:55,020
but...

3788
04:49:55,020 --> 04:49:57,020
I don't think

3789
04:49:57,020 --> 04:49:59,020
I like that type of gameplay.

3790
04:50:03,020 --> 04:50:05,020
But yeah, I do like SMT though,

3791
04:50:05,020 --> 04:50:07,020
like SMT games as a whole.

3792
04:50:09,020 --> 04:50:11,020
I do have... Oh, I do have...

3793
04:50:11,020 --> 04:50:13,020
I did like, um...

3794
04:50:13,020 --> 04:50:15,020
I did like...

3795
04:50:17,020 --> 04:50:19,020
Devil Summoner.

3796
04:50:19,020 --> 04:50:21,020
That one was good.

3797
04:50:23,020 --> 04:50:25,020
I like that one.

3798
04:50:27,020 --> 04:50:29,020
You take Strange Journey.

3799
04:50:29,020 --> 04:50:31,020
Do you... Do you like Soul Hackers?

3800
04:50:35,020 --> 04:50:37,020
Hold on, give me a minute.

3801
04:50:37,020 --> 04:50:39,020
I never played Soul Hackers, actually.

3802
04:50:39,020 --> 04:50:41,020
That's the only one I didn't...

3803
04:50:43,020 --> 04:50:45,020
That's the only one I didn't play.

3804
04:50:45,020 --> 04:50:47,020
I didn't get to play Soul Hackers.

3805
04:50:47,020 --> 04:50:49,020
That was the only one I didn't...

3806
04:50:49,020 --> 04:50:51,020
I didn't play.

3807
04:50:51,020 --> 04:50:53,020
I was never able to find it.

3808
04:51:01,020 --> 04:51:03,020
I know the second one,

3809
04:51:03,020 --> 04:51:05,020
the Hackers 2 that came out recently,

3810
04:51:05,020 --> 04:51:07,020
has very mixed reviews,

3811
04:51:07,020 --> 04:51:09,020
and it makes me

3812
04:51:09,020 --> 04:51:11,020
hesitant to even pick it up,

3813
04:51:11,020 --> 04:51:13,020
you know?

3814
04:51:15,020 --> 04:51:17,020
I think another game I would love to play

3815
04:51:17,020 --> 04:51:19,020
are the Atelier games.

3816
04:51:19,020 --> 04:51:21,020
So, I'd love to play, like...

3817
04:51:21,020 --> 04:51:23,020
Atelier.

3818
04:51:23,020 --> 04:51:25,020
I know... I know...

3819
04:51:25,020 --> 04:51:27,020
My first Atelier game is not exactly like

3820
04:51:27,020 --> 04:51:29,020
one that...

3821
04:51:29,020 --> 04:51:31,020
Uh...

3822
04:51:31,020 --> 04:51:33,020
That people are like,

3823
04:51:33,020 --> 04:51:35,020
oh, that's not... That's the one that...

3824
04:51:35,020 --> 04:51:37,020
That you... You like?

3825
04:51:37,020 --> 04:51:39,020
So, the one that I liked

3826
04:51:39,020 --> 04:51:41,020
and the one that I played,

3827
04:51:41,020 --> 04:51:43,020
the most of that I really enjoyed

3828
04:51:43,020 --> 04:51:45,020
was Liddy and Soule.

3829
04:51:45,020 --> 04:51:47,020
I don't know, I thought it was cute?

3830
04:51:51,020 --> 04:51:53,020
I thought it was super cute,

3831
04:51:53,020 --> 04:51:55,020
and I thought it was, like, great.

3832
04:51:55,020 --> 04:51:57,020
And then I wanted to play,

3833
04:51:57,020 --> 04:51:59,020
like, Sophie and stuff,

3834
04:51:59,020 --> 04:52:01,020
but I just never had the time to,

3835
04:52:01,020 --> 04:52:03,020
and then I played a bit of Ryza,

3836
04:52:03,020 --> 04:52:05,020
and I was like, oh, yeah, this is great.

3837
04:52:05,020 --> 04:52:07,020
I played, um...

3838
04:52:07,020 --> 04:52:09,020
But then I just didn't have time to pick it up again.

3839
04:52:09,020 --> 04:52:11,020
I bought the Ryza books, though,

3840
04:52:11,020 --> 04:52:13,020
and I loved the art by Noko.

3841
04:52:13,020 --> 04:52:15,020
Noko did a great job

3842
04:52:15,020 --> 04:52:17,020
on all the arts, because I think

3843
04:52:17,020 --> 04:52:19,020
they're a great artist.

3844
04:52:19,020 --> 04:52:21,020
Um...

3845
04:52:21,020 --> 04:52:23,020
I played...

3846
04:52:23,020 --> 04:52:25,020
Atelier...

3847
04:52:25,020 --> 04:52:27,020
Rorona, I think?

3848
04:52:27,020 --> 04:52:29,020
Rorona?

3849
04:52:29,020 --> 04:52:31,020
Not Rorona, sorry.

3850
04:52:31,020 --> 04:52:33,020
Which one is the one with the pink-haired

3851
04:52:33,020 --> 04:52:35,020
daughter... daughter one?

3852
04:52:37,020 --> 04:52:39,020
What's the list of it?

3853
04:52:39,020 --> 04:52:41,020
Not Meridu.

3854
04:52:41,020 --> 04:52:43,020
It's, like, the one

3855
04:52:43,020 --> 04:52:45,020
that's, like, one of them's a kid.

3856
04:52:45,020 --> 04:52:47,020
Uh...

3857
04:52:47,020 --> 04:52:49,020
Shit, what's it called?

3858
04:52:49,020 --> 04:52:51,020
The kid?

3859
04:52:51,020 --> 04:52:53,020
I think? Is it Meridu?

3860
04:52:57,020 --> 04:52:59,020
It's kind of new-ish.

3861
04:52:59,020 --> 04:53:01,020
No, it's not Meridu.

3862
04:53:01,020 --> 04:53:03,020
Hold on.

3863
04:53:03,020 --> 04:53:05,020
List of...

3864
04:53:05,020 --> 04:53:07,020
Atelier games?

3865
04:53:07,020 --> 04:53:09,020
Atelier games? Thank you.

3866
04:53:09,020 --> 04:53:11,020
Uh...

3867
04:53:11,020 --> 04:53:13,020
This one!

3868
04:53:13,020 --> 04:53:15,020
Atelier Lulua!

3869
04:53:15,020 --> 04:53:17,020
I hated Lulua!

3870
04:53:17,020 --> 04:53:19,020
I hated Lulua!

3871
04:53:19,020 --> 04:53:21,020
It was cheap! I was like...

3872
04:53:21,020 --> 04:53:23,020
I feel like I'm playing a stupid phone game!

3873
04:53:23,020 --> 04:53:25,020
What the fuck?

3874
04:53:29,020 --> 04:53:31,020
I know what her keyboard sounds

3875
04:53:31,020 --> 04:53:33,020
is so immaculate.

3876
04:53:33,020 --> 04:53:35,020
Oh yeah, my keyboard, it's, um...

3877
04:53:35,020 --> 04:53:37,020
red switches

3878
04:53:37,020 --> 04:53:39,020
so they don't make that much noise.

3879
04:53:39,020 --> 04:53:41,020
Sorry, Senpai.

3880
04:53:41,020 --> 04:53:43,020
But, like,

3881
04:53:43,020 --> 04:53:45,020
Atelier Lulua was shit garbage.

3882
04:53:45,020 --> 04:53:47,020
I was like, I feel like I'm playing a stupid phone game.

3883
04:53:49,020 --> 04:53:51,020
It was, it wasn't interactive.

3884
04:53:51,020 --> 04:53:53,020
It was no fun.

3885
04:53:53,020 --> 04:53:55,020
I feel like it was rushed.

3886
04:53:55,020 --> 04:53:57,020
It was not good.

3887
04:53:57,020 --> 04:53:59,020
It was not good.

3888
04:54:01,020 --> 04:54:03,020
Like, it looks cute. Like, it looks cute

3889
04:54:03,020 --> 04:54:05,020
as fuck, right?

3890
04:54:05,020 --> 04:54:07,020
Like...

3891
04:54:07,020 --> 04:54:09,020
The design is, uh...

3892
04:54:11,020 --> 04:54:13,020
is, it's cute.

3893
04:54:13,020 --> 04:54:15,020
I thought it would be, like,

3894
04:54:15,020 --> 04:54:17,020
Liddy and Sue

3895
04:54:17,020 --> 04:54:19,020
and it just wasn't there.

3896
04:54:21,020 --> 04:54:23,020
It just wasn't there.

3897
04:54:23,020 --> 04:54:25,020
And I was playing Lulua and I was like,

3898
04:54:25,020 --> 04:54:27,020
oh fuck, this sucks.

3899
04:54:27,020 --> 04:54:29,020
This really fucking sucks.

3900
04:54:29,020 --> 04:54:31,020
Uh...

3901
04:54:31,020 --> 04:54:33,020
And so I just

3902
04:54:33,020 --> 04:54:35,020
didn't want to play

3903
04:54:35,020 --> 04:54:37,020
Lulua.

3904
04:54:37,020 --> 04:54:39,020
After, like, the getting out of the town,

3905
04:54:39,020 --> 04:54:41,020
I was like, and playing a little bit

3906
04:54:41,020 --> 04:54:43,020
in the area, I was like, this fucking sucks.

3907
04:54:47,020 --> 04:54:49,020
So, I didn't enjoy it,

3908
04:54:49,020 --> 04:54:51,020
but I hear Riza is so much better

3909
04:54:51,020 --> 04:54:53,020
and I played a bit of Riza and I think

3910
04:54:53,020 --> 04:54:55,020
I think I enjoyed it.

3911
04:54:55,020 --> 04:54:57,020
I really think I did enjoy

3912
04:54:57,020 --> 04:54:59,020
Riza.

3913
04:54:59,020 --> 04:55:01,020
Uh, but, like, Lulua sucked.

3914
04:55:01,020 --> 04:55:03,020
Uh, Riza.

3915
04:55:03,020 --> 04:55:05,020
And I would love to play, like, Riza 2

3916
04:55:05,020 --> 04:55:07,020
and Riza 3. I have Riza on

3917
04:55:07,020 --> 04:55:09,020
PS4, so I'll have to plug that in

3918
04:55:09,020 --> 04:55:11,020
again. I, I, I'm kind of like,

3919
04:55:11,020 --> 04:55:13,020
I don't, I kind of don't

3920
04:55:13,020 --> 04:55:15,020
want to, uh, buy

3921
04:55:15,020 --> 04:55:17,020
more games.

3922
04:55:19,020 --> 04:55:21,020
So, yeah, but otherwise,

3923
04:55:21,020 --> 04:55:23,020
yeah, those are some games that I'm

3924
04:55:23,020 --> 04:55:25,020
kind of like, yeah, I kind of want to play those,

3925
04:55:25,020 --> 04:55:27,020
but I'm also

3926
04:55:27,020 --> 04:55:29,020
a little hesitant because it's

3927
04:55:29,020 --> 04:55:31,020
grindy and

3928
04:55:31,020 --> 04:55:33,020
I don't know, sometimes we'll be bored if

3929
04:55:33,020 --> 04:55:35,020
I grind it a lot.

3930
04:55:37,020 --> 04:55:39,020
Any JRPGs you want to play on stream,

3931
04:55:39,020 --> 04:55:41,020
like Dragon Quest? Uh...

3932
04:55:47,020 --> 04:55:49,020
What was the, what was the western RPG

3933
04:55:49,020 --> 04:55:51,020
that I was playing that I was

3934
04:55:51,020 --> 04:55:53,020
saying before? Wild Arms!

3935
04:55:53,020 --> 04:55:55,020
I play Wild Arms.

3936
04:55:57,020 --> 04:55:59,020
And...

3937
04:55:59,020 --> 04:56:01,020
Uh...

3938
04:56:03,020 --> 04:56:05,020
And...

3939
04:56:05,020 --> 04:56:07,020
I don't know, other ones.

3940
04:56:07,020 --> 04:56:09,020
I have to look through my collection again.

3941
04:56:17,020 --> 04:56:19,020
Um...

3942
04:56:19,020 --> 04:56:21,020
Neptunia?

3943
04:56:21,020 --> 04:56:23,020
Oh gosh, Neptunia games suck.

3944
04:56:23,020 --> 04:56:25,020
It's hot

3945
04:56:25,020 --> 04:56:27,020
garbage.

3946
04:56:31,020 --> 04:56:33,020
I look, I look at...

3947
04:56:33,020 --> 04:56:35,020
I go

3948
04:56:35,020 --> 04:56:37,020
to the

3949
04:56:37,020 --> 04:56:39,020
store.

3950
04:56:39,020 --> 04:56:41,020
The, the, the, the

3951
04:56:41,020 --> 04:56:43,020
the worker was

3952
04:56:43,020 --> 04:56:45,020
like...

3953
04:56:45,020 --> 04:56:47,020
was like, oh, Neptunia?

3954
04:56:47,020 --> 04:56:49,020
Are, are these game, I was

3955
04:56:49,020 --> 04:56:51,020
meaning to get into it. Are these games good?

3956
04:56:51,020 --> 04:56:53,020
I go, no, it fucking sucks. Don't even bother.

3957
04:56:53,020 --> 04:56:55,020
Pay them, pay them

3958
04:56:55,020 --> 04:56:57,020
their money and go

3959
04:56:57,020 --> 04:56:59,020
leave with my Neptunia game.

3960
04:56:59,020 --> 04:57:01,020
And they fucky. And I'm just like, I fucking

3961
04:57:01,020 --> 04:57:03,020
hate this game, but it's so cute.

3962
04:57:03,020 --> 04:57:05,020
Dimes are so cute.

3963
04:57:09,020 --> 04:57:11,020
Like, honestly, hot garbage

3964
04:57:11,020 --> 04:57:13,020
shit gameplay, really great

3965
04:57:13,020 --> 04:57:15,020
design, really great characters.

3966
04:57:15,020 --> 04:57:17,020
I'm just like...

3967
04:57:21,020 --> 04:57:23,020
It's garbage.

3968
04:57:23,020 --> 04:57:25,020
Absolutely garbage. Every time,

3969
04:57:25,020 --> 04:57:27,020
every time I, I play another

3970
04:57:27,020 --> 04:57:29,020
Neptunia game, I'm just like, please

3971
04:57:29,020 --> 04:57:31,020
let it be good. And it's not.

3972
04:57:41,020 --> 04:57:43,020
I fucking hate it.

3973
04:57:43,020 --> 04:57:45,020
Fucking hate it.

3974
04:57:51,020 --> 04:57:53,020
I literally was like

3975
04:57:53,020 --> 04:57:55,020
literally the cash register guy

3976
04:57:55,020 --> 04:57:57,020
was like, oh yeah, I've been meaning to get into

3977
04:57:57,020 --> 04:57:59,020
the series. Is it any good? No.

3978
04:58:03,020 --> 04:58:05,020
Leaves.

3979
04:58:09,020 --> 04:58:11,020
But yeah, um,

3980
04:58:11,020 --> 04:58:13,020
I think I'll play Neptunia. I think all I

3981
04:58:13,020 --> 04:58:15,020
would do would be like, I hate

3982
04:58:15,020 --> 04:58:17,020
this.

3983
04:58:17,020 --> 04:58:19,020
All I would say

3984
04:58:19,020 --> 04:58:21,020
is that I would hate this.

3985
04:58:21,020 --> 04:58:23,020
Would you ever play the world end with you

3986
04:58:23,020 --> 04:58:25,020
on your DS Lite?

3987
04:58:25,020 --> 04:58:27,020
Uh, I would, but

3988
04:58:27,020 --> 04:58:29,020
I don't have anything to capture

3989
04:58:29,020 --> 04:58:31,020
DS with. So you'd need

3990
04:58:31,020 --> 04:58:33,020
like, uh, completely new DS

3991
04:58:33,020 --> 04:58:35,020
with a capture system

3992
04:58:35,020 --> 04:58:37,020
on it. And I just don't have that. And the guy

3993
04:58:37,020 --> 04:58:39,020
who used to make them, don't make them anymore.

3994
04:58:39,020 --> 04:58:41,020
So, uh, yeah, we're shit

3995
04:58:41,020 --> 04:58:43,020
out of luck, guys.

3996
04:58:45,020 --> 04:58:47,020
And I am not allowed to do anything else

3997
04:58:47,020 --> 04:58:49,020
other than play on original hardware stuff.

3998
04:58:55,020 --> 04:58:57,020
Any PS2 games

3999
04:58:57,020 --> 04:58:59,020
that you're looking forward to streaming soon?

4000
04:58:59,020 --> 04:59:01,020
Definitely.

4001
04:59:03,020 --> 04:59:05,020
Probably digital

4002
04:59:05,020 --> 04:59:07,020
Devil Saga

4003
04:59:07,020 --> 04:59:09,020
and Devil Summoner. Yeah, those two

4004
04:59:09,020 --> 04:59:11,020
are definitely like my main ones that I'm just like, yeah,

4005
04:59:11,020 --> 04:59:13,020
I'll be great.

4006
04:59:15,020 --> 04:59:17,020
Ah, DS Lite

4007
04:59:17,020 --> 04:59:19,020
Hand Cam Stream. That's not going to

4008
04:59:19,020 --> 04:59:21,020
work out senpai because I

4009
04:59:21,020 --> 04:59:23,020
I can get like button

4010
04:59:23,020 --> 04:59:25,020
mashing and it would just shake all the time.

4011
04:59:25,020 --> 04:59:27,020
So you wouldn't even be able to see

4012
04:59:27,020 --> 04:59:29,020
what is going on, right? And then I

4013
04:59:29,020 --> 04:59:31,020
turn

4014
04:59:31,020 --> 04:59:33,020
the DS and go

4015
04:59:33,020 --> 04:59:35,020
and it's not going to capture, right?

4016
04:59:37,020 --> 04:59:39,020
You know what I mean? Like handheld.

4017
04:59:39,020 --> 04:59:41,020
It's like you're you're supposed to turn

4018
04:59:41,020 --> 04:59:43,020
and go

4019
04:59:43,020 --> 04:59:45,020
go

4020
04:59:51,020 --> 04:59:53,020
You wouldn't happen to know Legend of

4021
04:59:53,020 --> 04:59:55,020
Legia, would you, Mercy?

4022
04:59:55,020 --> 04:59:57,020
Legend of Legia?

4023
04:59:57,020 --> 04:59:59,020
Legend of

4024
04:59:59,020 --> 05:00:01,020
Legia.

4025
05:00:01,020 --> 05:00:03,020
I might have to see it.

4026
05:00:03,020 --> 05:00:05,020
I do not know this game.

4027
05:00:07,020 --> 05:00:09,020
Well, it looks pretty cool.

4028
05:00:09,020 --> 05:00:11,020
I don't even know if I have it though.

4029
05:00:11,020 --> 05:00:13,020
I might have it. I have to look.

4030
05:00:21,020 --> 05:00:23,020
I have to look at it, but

4031
05:00:23,020 --> 05:00:25,020
I definitely want to play with like

4032
05:00:25,020 --> 05:00:27,020
if I could somehow

4033
05:00:31,020 --> 05:00:33,020
Excuse me.

4034
05:00:37,020 --> 05:00:39,020
Too much. Not enough liquid.

4035
05:00:43,020 --> 05:00:45,020
If I could

4036
05:00:49,020 --> 05:00:51,020
If I could

4037
05:00:53,020 --> 05:00:55,020
capture it somehow

4038
05:00:55,020 --> 05:00:57,020
for senpai while still be able

4039
05:00:57,020 --> 05:00:59,020
to use the stylus and everything because

4040
05:00:59,020 --> 05:01:01,020
let me tell you

4041
05:01:01,020 --> 05:01:03,020
it was really hard to play games.

4042
05:01:03,020 --> 05:01:05,020
DS games without

4043
05:01:05,020 --> 05:01:07,020
using the stylus.

4044
05:01:13,020 --> 05:01:15,020
You know, Legend of Legia, my nuts

4045
05:01:15,020 --> 05:01:17,020
asshole

4046
05:01:35,020 --> 05:01:37,020
Anyways

4047
05:01:43,020 --> 05:01:45,020
But yeah, I love using

4048
05:01:45,020 --> 05:01:47,020
the stylus. I'm not going to lie.

4049
05:01:47,020 --> 05:01:49,020
I love using the stylus so

4050
05:01:49,020 --> 05:01:51,020
playing any DS games without

4051
05:01:51,020 --> 05:01:53,020
using the stylus would fucking suck.

4052
05:01:53,020 --> 05:01:55,020
Forget, do you like rhythm games?

4053
05:01:55,020 --> 05:01:57,020
No.

4054
05:01:57,020 --> 05:01:59,020
I suck at rhythm. I have no sense of rhythm.

4055
05:01:59,020 --> 05:02:01,020
Thank you, Jamie, for the

4056
05:02:01,020 --> 05:02:03,020
for the

4057
05:02:03,020 --> 05:02:05,020
most tier, for sending off the most

4058
05:02:05,020 --> 05:02:07,020
tier. Thank you.

4059
05:02:07,020 --> 05:02:09,020
For being a member.

4060
05:02:09,020 --> 05:02:11,020
Most tier and membership is still the same, right?

4061
05:02:11,020 --> 05:02:13,020
Yeah, yeah.

4062
05:02:13,020 --> 05:02:15,020
It should be the same. Thank you for being a member.

4063
05:02:23,020 --> 05:02:25,020
I wonder if you do the Yakuza series. I do have some

4064
05:02:25,020 --> 05:02:27,020
Yakuza games, so

4065
05:02:27,020 --> 05:02:29,020
Maybe

4066
05:02:29,020 --> 05:02:31,020
I had fun, but most of the time

4067
05:02:31,020 --> 05:02:33,020
I know

4068
05:02:33,020 --> 05:02:35,020
I know that

4069
05:02:35,020 --> 05:02:37,020
I'm going to just

4070
05:02:37,020 --> 05:02:39,020
play the claw game over

4071
05:02:39,020 --> 05:02:41,020
and over.

4072
05:02:47,020 --> 05:02:49,020
I'll play the claw game over and over.

4073
05:02:49,020 --> 05:02:51,020
I'll be like, check this out, Senpai.

4074
05:02:51,020 --> 05:02:53,020
Yeah.

4075
05:02:57,020 --> 05:02:59,020
Look at me. I'm

4076
05:02:59,020 --> 05:03:01,020
winning.

4077
05:03:05,020 --> 05:03:07,020
Yeah, winning prizes for Senpai.

4078
05:03:11,020 --> 05:03:13,020
Go to karaoke.

4079
05:03:13,020 --> 05:03:15,020
I suck at karaoke, by the way.

4080
05:03:19,020 --> 05:03:21,020
I suck at the karaoke because it's like

4081
05:03:21,020 --> 05:03:23,020
I'm not familiar

4082
05:03:23,020 --> 05:03:25,020
because I always get confused about which

4083
05:03:25,020 --> 05:03:27,020
controller I'm using. So when it's like

4084
05:03:27,020 --> 05:03:29,020
press the buttons and the rhythm

4085
05:03:29,020 --> 05:03:31,020
and I'm like, oh shit, which buttons which

4086
05:03:35,020 --> 05:03:37,020
Honestly, I went to

4087
05:03:37,020 --> 05:03:39,020
the

4088
05:03:39,020 --> 05:03:41,020
when I was playing Yakuza Zero, I went to the

4089
05:03:43,020 --> 05:03:45,020
the video club a lot.

4090
05:03:53,020 --> 05:03:55,020
The video store a lot.

4091
05:03:57,020 --> 05:03:59,020
I

4092
05:04:05,020 --> 05:04:07,020
Me too for completion rewards, right?

4093
05:04:07,020 --> 05:04:09,020
Yeah, completion rewards.

4094
05:04:23,020 --> 05:04:25,020
Get that a hundred percent.

4095
05:04:27,020 --> 05:04:29,020
Oh

4096
05:04:29,020 --> 05:04:31,020
man, I'm still yapping.

4097
05:04:31,020 --> 05:04:33,020
I'm still yapping.

4098
05:04:45,020 --> 05:04:47,020
I want to play lots of games with Senpai

4099
05:04:47,020 --> 05:04:49,020
and I know it's like

4100
05:04:49,020 --> 05:04:51,020
oh

4101
05:04:51,020 --> 05:04:53,020
I feel bad though

4102
05:04:53,020 --> 05:04:55,020
because

4103
05:04:55,020 --> 05:04:57,020
all I've been playing have been games

4104
05:04:57,020 --> 05:04:59,020
and I've been like

4105
05:04:59,020 --> 05:05:01,020
oh yeah, I want to schedule this game

4106
05:05:01,020 --> 05:05:03,020
and this game and then I'm like

4107
05:05:03,020 --> 05:05:05,020
I should probably schedule in some other

4108
05:05:05,020 --> 05:05:07,020
stuff too.

4109
05:05:09,020 --> 05:05:11,020
Are you planning to do another karaoke stream?

4110
05:05:11,020 --> 05:05:13,020
Yeah.

4111
05:05:13,020 --> 05:05:15,020
I don't know when

4112
05:05:15,020 --> 05:05:17,020
but yeah.

4113
05:05:21,020 --> 05:05:23,020
I've been like, oh my gosh, I want to play this game

4114
05:05:23,020 --> 05:05:25,020
this game and this game and this game

4115
05:05:25,020 --> 05:05:27,020
other stuff, yeah, like ASMR

4116
05:05:27,020 --> 05:05:29,020
maybe like

4117
05:05:29,020 --> 05:05:31,020
I don't know like

4118
05:05:31,020 --> 05:05:33,020
hand cam streams

4119
05:05:33,020 --> 05:05:35,020
uh

4120
05:05:35,020 --> 05:05:37,020
batsu wheel or something like that

4121
05:05:37,020 --> 05:05:39,020
but me I was like a game, game, game, game

4122
05:05:39,020 --> 05:05:41,020
game, game, game, game, game, game, game

4123
05:05:47,020 --> 05:05:49,020
like I was like maybe I should do

4124
05:05:49,020 --> 05:05:51,020
do those things

4125
05:05:51,020 --> 05:05:53,020
and I'm just like

4126
05:05:53,020 --> 05:05:55,020
but this game, I want to play this game

4127
05:05:55,020 --> 05:05:57,020
with Senpai

4128
05:05:57,020 --> 05:05:59,020
Senpai, help me, this part is hard

4129
05:06:05,020 --> 05:06:07,020
speaking of hand cam streams

4130
05:06:07,020 --> 05:06:09,020
how did the alchemy come out?

4131
05:06:09,020 --> 05:06:11,020
It's super cute!

4132
05:06:11,020 --> 05:06:13,020
It's unlike my makeup

4133
05:06:13,020 --> 05:06:15,020
it's not like my makeup

4134
05:06:15,020 --> 05:06:17,020
uh

4135
05:06:17,020 --> 05:06:19,020
container thing

4136
05:06:19,020 --> 05:06:21,020
oh well

4137
05:06:21,020 --> 05:06:23,020
it's on that right now

4138
05:06:29,020 --> 05:06:31,020
so that's why I was like

4139
05:06:31,020 --> 05:06:33,020
uh okay

4140
05:06:35,020 --> 05:06:37,020
honestly I'm just like uh

4141
05:06:37,020 --> 05:06:39,020
hand cam ASMR

4142
05:06:39,020 --> 05:06:41,020
um I'm not sure if I can

4143
05:06:41,020 --> 05:06:43,020
knew that I feel like

4144
05:06:45,020 --> 05:06:47,020
I feel like it's you know

4145
05:06:49,020 --> 05:06:51,020
it's just super awkward

4146
05:06:53,020 --> 05:06:55,020
since I'm very unfamiliar

4147
05:06:55,020 --> 05:06:57,020
with ASMR

4148
05:06:57,020 --> 05:06:59,020
and I'm still learning

4149
05:06:59,020 --> 05:07:01,020
I would be like just me

4150
05:07:01,020 --> 05:07:03,020
just need my hands just go like

4151
05:07:03,020 --> 05:07:05,020
ugh

4152
05:07:05,020 --> 05:07:07,020
shrugging every moment

4153
05:07:11,020 --> 05:07:13,020
like I don't know what I'm doing

4154
05:07:15,020 --> 05:07:17,020
I'm just doing what I think

4155
05:07:17,020 --> 05:07:19,020
would sound nice

4156
05:07:19,020 --> 05:07:21,020
honestly like

4157
05:07:21,020 --> 05:07:23,020
I bought some things and I was like

4158
05:07:23,020 --> 05:07:25,020
um

4159
05:07:25,020 --> 05:07:27,020
I think this would sound nice on a microphone

4160
05:07:27,020 --> 05:07:29,020
on like the 3D

4161
05:07:29,020 --> 05:07:31,020
oh I think it would sound nice

4162
05:07:31,020 --> 05:07:33,020
gives us, gives you a thumbs up

4163
05:07:33,020 --> 05:07:35,020
yeah

4164
05:07:43,020 --> 05:07:45,020
so I feel so awkward

4165
05:07:45,020 --> 05:07:47,020
when I do like ASMR

4166
05:07:47,020 --> 05:07:49,020
I mean like

4167
05:07:49,020 --> 05:07:51,020
I think

4168
05:07:51,020 --> 05:07:53,020
I kind of face palm on myself

4169
05:07:53,020 --> 05:07:55,020
when people are like do ear copying

4170
05:07:55,020 --> 05:07:57,020
and then I was like

4171
05:07:59,020 --> 05:08:01,020
the 3D all ears with your hands

4172
05:08:01,020 --> 05:08:03,020
and I said okay

4173
05:08:03,020 --> 05:08:05,020
and then I had to ask

4174
05:08:05,020 --> 05:08:07,020
10 pies, now what

4175
05:08:07,020 --> 05:08:09,020
ah

4176
05:08:13,020 --> 05:08:15,020
I didn't know what copying was

4177
05:08:21,020 --> 05:08:23,020
like I was researching

4178
05:08:23,020 --> 05:08:25,020
stuff and then I was like

4179
05:08:25,020 --> 05:08:27,020
I don't know everything

4180
05:08:29,020 --> 05:08:31,020
so yeah I feel a little

4181
05:08:31,020 --> 05:08:33,020
embarrassed about that

4182
05:08:33,020 --> 05:08:43,540
But yeah, otherwise it's um, yeah, I think it's fun, it's also fun.

4183
05:08:43,540 --> 05:08:49,580
The giggles were the best part, I think Senpai is making me laugh and then it's really hard

4184
05:08:49,580 --> 05:08:56,820
to not laugh when you're trying to not laugh and then it becomes like it's you laugh harder.

4185
05:08:56,820 --> 05:09:05,020
Oh yeah, just try, try trying to laugh quietly or trying to not laugh and then you end up

4186
05:09:05,020 --> 05:09:13,300
laughing, you know, and then you keep on laughing and you can't stop.

4187
05:09:13,300 --> 05:09:22,220
So yeah, that is the giggle, yeah, the giggle feedback loop, exactly.

4188
05:09:22,220 --> 05:09:30,580
So yeah, oh speaking of Senpai, um, did you see my new ASMR video?

4189
05:09:30,580 --> 05:09:39,100
Kind of, it's kind of like a jokie ASMR video.

4190
05:09:39,100 --> 05:09:40,100
You did?

4191
05:09:40,100 --> 05:09:41,100
You did?

4192
05:09:41,100 --> 05:09:42,100
Yeah.

4193
05:09:42,100 --> 05:09:43,100
Did you know?

4194
05:09:43,100 --> 05:09:44,100
My laughing?

4195
05:09:44,100 --> 05:09:47,380
I didn't stop laughing, it was straight up.

4196
05:09:47,380 --> 05:10:00,340
I laughed for, I couldn't get past, I laughed, I laughed non-stop, that was one take, yeah.

4197
05:10:00,340 --> 05:10:04,340
You know what else is also one take?

4198
05:10:04,340 --> 05:10:08,900
That's surprising?

4199
05:10:08,900 --> 05:10:20,260
My cover song, the like, notice me Senpai cover song was also one take.

4200
05:10:20,260 --> 05:10:21,980
Because I will tell you why.

4201
05:10:21,980 --> 05:10:27,460
People were like, oh, why didn't you do it in parts and I was like, listen, that song

4202
05:10:27,460 --> 05:10:34,420
is kind of bad, I'm not going to lie to you, um, that song is kind of bad, so if I don't

4203
05:10:34,420 --> 05:10:45,300
do it in one take, I'm going to lose the rhythm really fast.

4204
05:10:45,300 --> 05:10:57,660
So I, like, when I tried it in parts, I was like, I cannot, I cannot do this in more than

4205
05:10:57,660 --> 05:11:27,660
one part because it's going to lose, I'm going to just be like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-

4206
05:11:27,660 --> 05:11:50,660
different like that's that's the that's the beat right it's hard it's hard to follow that

4207
05:11:50,660 --> 05:11:53,500
it's hard to follow that so I was like I have to do it in one shot

4208
05:11:53,500 --> 05:12:06,540
hey yo why are you clapping to the beat of the song and pie I saw you at school today took

4209
05:12:06,540 --> 05:12:14,260
your picture then I walked no then I snapped away I want you to notice me but I'm just someone

4210
05:12:14,260 --> 05:12:22,660
you don't notice still I think I've got another rival I have to kill right you see you see where

4211
05:12:22,700 --> 05:12:31,340
I'm just like okay this is not this is having I'm having problems here please notice me some pie

4212
05:12:31,340 --> 05:12:48,700
please notice me some pie right and then I messed up a bunch of times honestly but but

4213
05:12:48,700 --> 05:13:04,500
editors be editing you know luckily like it it's it's hard if when I did the song it was

4214
05:13:04,500 --> 05:13:16,020
some pie I saw you at school today took your picture then I snuck away I want you to notice me

4215
05:13:16,020 --> 05:13:23,060
but you're just someone I'm just someone you don't notice fuck it's really hard it's really hard

4216
05:13:23,060 --> 05:13:30,620
okay so it's it's a song it's definitely a song you cannot sing in parts you should share the

4217
05:13:30,620 --> 05:13:39,420
unedited version someday the unedited version only has one mistake it only has one mistake and

4218
05:13:39,420 --> 05:13:45,300
the mistake is an please notice me one please notice me some pie that was easily edited and

4219
05:13:45,300 --> 05:13:53,260
the only reason why that was a mistake was because I ran out of breath one please notice me some

4220
05:13:53,260 --> 05:14:11,020
pie and it was just like please notice me some pie and that was it breathing breathing

4221
05:14:11,020 --> 05:14:21,940
specs again that cup sounded real about Calif was real I was easily edited out because well I

4222
05:14:21,940 --> 05:14:28,900
say like please notice me some pie like a million times right like so many times just replace one

4223
05:14:28,900 --> 05:14:46,140
it's fine like that was the only mistake I had and I think I lost the beat a little bit towards

4224
05:14:46,140 --> 05:15:01,460
the end cuz I was like okay I hate this song like I originally I actually asked cuz I was like

4225
05:15:01,460 --> 05:15:09,340
I'm supposed to cover this and I know I know it's like a song that people like but I honestly do

4226
05:15:09,340 --> 05:15:18,180
not like the song personally because it just doesn't sound good to me then again I am also not a

4227
05:15:18,180 --> 05:15:24,540
music person and as you all know that I am I don't really listen to music senpai senpai so I don't

4228
05:15:24,540 --> 05:15:32,860
listen to music so I'm kind of insane I'm kind of insane it's probably yeah it's probably just

4229
05:15:32,860 --> 05:15:42,980
something simple like it's not enough melody or something it turned out well man yeah I'm glad it

4230
05:15:42,980 --> 05:15:50,380
turned out well because I was like oh no music at all yeah like when I'm studying or focused I

4231
05:15:50,380 --> 05:16:00,780
don't listen to music like at all the only times I ever listen to music is kind of like if I want

4232
05:16:00,780 --> 05:16:14,220
something atmospheric then it's like a gay molestee or anime song really no song when though I would

4233
05:16:14,220 --> 05:16:25,580
love to I would love to release some of my original songs yeah you listen to Amiens or

4234
05:16:25,580 --> 05:16:31,540
white noise or not listen to things why you work I don't listen to anything at all why I work senpai

4235
05:16:31,540 --> 05:16:40,300
like honestly I do not listen to any music it is silent why I'm working I cannot have anything

4236
05:16:40,540 --> 05:16:53,420
interrupt me why I think like otherwise I get too distracted or it's just I don't like it

4237
05:16:57,740 --> 05:17:03,820
like I just don't like it I just need my moment to to be in my head and just write it

4238
05:17:03,980 --> 05:17:13,580
but like most people will just call me insane and they're right I am definitely not someone

4239
05:17:14,460 --> 05:17:20,380
um that's not normal I know that's not normal so that's why people are like yeah you're kind of

4240
05:17:20,380 --> 05:17:29,100
insane and I'm like yeah you're right you're right that is insane behavior but I don't know it's just

4241
05:17:29,100 --> 05:17:37,660
something I've been like doing most of my life like if I need total silence okay this is

4242
05:17:37,660 --> 05:17:49,660
this is going to be very funny but when I was in college I would sometimes if I wanted total

4243
05:17:49,660 --> 05:18:01,580
deafening silence I would work in the bathroom I would study in the bathroom because it was quiet

4244
05:18:01,580 --> 05:18:08,300
there was nothing yeah it was just like you know the echoing or like whatever like the

4245
05:18:08,300 --> 05:18:12,380
complete silence in the bathroom was just I just studied there

4246
05:18:17,180 --> 05:18:25,260
but the germs it's my germs like at home at home not like in the school bathroom I meant at

4247
05:18:25,260 --> 05:18:33,420
home I would study in the bathroom like in the tub because I could just focus there

4248
05:18:43,740 --> 05:18:52,460
okay if you top has plenty of space and like I would actually bring in a table I would bring

4249
05:18:52,460 --> 05:19:04,700
in a table and then I would just work in silence because it was like away from everything there

4250
05:19:04,700 --> 05:19:13,580
was nothing distracting me I would just I just work and it it was really productive

4251
05:19:14,540 --> 05:19:22,620
it was a tub full full of what it's just me it's just me I'll just sit in there or I'll sit on

4252
05:19:23,580 --> 05:19:30,140
I'll put down the toilet seat like cover and then I would just put the table and just start studying

4253
05:19:34,060 --> 05:19:39,260
not soaking in the water no it's like empty empty you know whatever gets you to pass

4254
05:19:40,220 --> 05:19:45,580
I got pretty good grade senpai so don't worry don't worry senpai I got good grades

4255
05:19:57,580 --> 05:20:04,860
so yeah I would just work in the bathroom and just study and write notes in the bathroom

4256
05:20:04,860 --> 05:20:09,980
because there was nothing distracting me and the bathroom has like white walls so it felt

4257
05:20:09,980 --> 05:20:14,540
kind of sterile too so I was like okay yeah it's just peaceful here I can study here

4258
05:20:17,100 --> 05:20:23,500
because if I'm in my if I'm in my bedroom and I'm just like oh I have so many toys to play with

4259
05:20:24,060 --> 05:20:38,140
how do I get this kind of power like studying power I don't know

4260
05:20:41,100 --> 05:20:50,300
toys yeah like you know my ds is there or the tv is there and and uh look my vita oh my gosh look

4261
05:20:50,300 --> 05:20:51,740
there's new shows ah

4262
05:20:55,820 --> 05:21:05,900
oh my gosh books mangos mangos yeah I can't think when it's too quiet how'd you get the opposite

4263
05:21:12,780 --> 05:21:18,860
honestly using a tv as a toy is crazy really I don't know I feel like technology is like a

4264
05:21:18,940 --> 05:21:29,980
sort of toy for everyone right that's why I call it a toy um

4265
05:21:35,900 --> 05:21:39,180
honestly how I got to study was I guess

4266
05:21:44,060 --> 05:21:45,980
I didn't have anything else to think about

4267
05:21:49,420 --> 05:21:54,220
I I didn't have anything else to think about and deadlines really worried me and I had like

4268
05:21:54,220 --> 05:21:59,740
the crippling anxiety of failure so I was like no I can't do it I had I have to pass

4269
05:22:04,780 --> 05:22:06,940
and I don't know I also had uh

4270
05:22:09,260 --> 05:22:13,740
I had like a genuine interest in the subject as well

4271
05:22:14,060 --> 05:22:23,020
so uh if I I did much better in subjects I had an interest in of course

4272
05:22:27,260 --> 05:22:34,220
and other times I would be like uh no I'm oh I although I did quite well for subjects I

4273
05:22:34,220 --> 05:22:37,420
did had no interest in I still forced myself to be interested

4274
05:22:37,660 --> 05:22:46,940
so yeah uh honestly if anyone has like studying techniques or anything and they ask me I just

4275
05:22:46,940 --> 05:22:57,340
like uh work in the bathroom I don't know I I was I'm weird I'm a little weirdo

4276
05:22:58,060 --> 05:23:08,060
I'm a little weirdo and so yeah I I like honestly I genuinely like studying as well

4277
05:23:17,340 --> 05:23:20,780
so yeah mercy solution is simple don't have ADHD

4278
05:23:22,940 --> 05:23:25,260
yeah only have diet ADHD

4279
05:23:28,300 --> 05:23:33,420
but yeah I'm I'm a little bit strange I'm a little bit loopy I guess

4280
05:23:36,860 --> 05:23:41,100
but yeah I I I can hyper fixate on something real fast

4281
05:23:46,700 --> 05:23:47,340
so yeah

4282
05:23:49,900 --> 05:23:53,820
uh yeah studying tip for me probably really fucking useless

4283
05:23:58,220 --> 05:24:00,220
yeah

4284
05:24:07,180 --> 05:24:12,220
yeah that's why we like you is because I'm a I'm a little weirdo I'm a little freak

4285
05:24:14,700 --> 05:24:15,740
thanks senpai

4286
05:24:19,900 --> 05:24:23,740
I I I appreciate it

4287
05:24:27,820 --> 05:24:29,740
so

4288
05:24:32,700 --> 05:24:33,740
hold on

4289
05:24:38,460 --> 05:24:42,460
I want to see who's on

4290
05:24:45,180 --> 05:24:53,260
felt that I can grade into them I'm I'm I'm winding down senpai I'm winding down

4291
05:24:53,980 --> 05:25:04,220
so I'm feeling I'm feeling like I'm gonna wind down enjoy myself what do I have for my schedule

4292
05:25:04,220 --> 05:25:12,860
tomorrow right I have my collab with strawney tomorrow I I am going to be playing untitled goose

4293
05:25:12,860 --> 05:25:23,100
game and then I have a day off and then we have the uno collab and then another day off so

4294
05:25:23,660 --> 05:25:29,500
uh next week I'm going to probably have a very small schedule as well

4295
05:25:30,460 --> 05:25:37,740
um just so I can I can get like a lot of things done I still have a lot of a lot of chores and

4296
05:25:37,740 --> 05:25:45,180
I need some days to just relax by myself or relax with some friends as well so I

4297
05:25:45,180 --> 05:25:49,580
I need a few more days off to do chores and then also like have some time

4298
05:25:50,300 --> 05:26:00,780
so yeah uh that's my schedule coming up I am probably going to pick up some new games

4299
05:26:00,780 --> 05:26:09,500
next week so that uh we'll have a little bit of variety and then come back to other games

4300
05:26:09,500 --> 05:26:15,340
just so to like finish some games off uh I think I'm still pretty far in killer seven

4301
05:26:16,300 --> 05:26:21,500
like I'm still kind of in the beginning part with killer seven I'm not good at that game so

4302
05:26:21,500 --> 05:26:33,900
that one will probably be spaced apart as well and uh and I know I know I'm gonna pick up some

4303
05:26:33,900 --> 05:26:40,860
games so yeah did we finish harvester I passed out no we're I think I think I'm at the very last

4304
05:26:40,860 --> 05:26:46,620
ending of harvester I think I think we have at least one or two more hours of that game so I

4305
05:26:47,420 --> 05:26:54,620
I am hoping to finish it at least the week after next week yeah I want to finish harvester

4306
05:27:00,780 --> 05:27:03,900
so I'm pretty sure I have like an hour to two hours left

4307
05:27:04,780 --> 05:27:12,700
yeah we can harvest one more stream out of that game and then we close a chapter

4308
05:27:13,500 --> 05:27:18,860
in harvester and we pick up a new game like another new game

4309
05:27:22,380 --> 05:27:27,740
it really depends on like how I feel like some games I'm kind of trying out to just gauge like

4310
05:27:27,740 --> 05:27:30,940
how us tempis like them or not as well

4311
05:27:36,780 --> 05:27:41,740
