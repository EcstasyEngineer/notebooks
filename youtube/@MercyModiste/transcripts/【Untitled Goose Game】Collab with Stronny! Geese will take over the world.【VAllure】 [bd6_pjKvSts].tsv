4147800	4152360	Uh, well, I do objectives. Let's see what our objectives are.
4152360	4155760	Make someone break the fancy vase.
4155760	4159360	Help the woman dress up the bust.
4159360	4161400	Make the man spit out his tea.
4161400	4163240	Get dressed up with a ribbon.
4163240	4165760	Make the man go barefoot.
4165760	4167440	Do the washing.
4167440	4169280	What?!
4169280	4172280	Are we supposed to go into, like, different gardens?
4172280	4174520	Oh, wait! This is the man spit out his tea.
4174520	4178320	Um...
4178320	4180160	Yeah, here's your hat.
4180160	4182120	How do we make someone spit their tea out?
4182120	4185120	That's so specific.
4185120	4187720	Get trapped, nerd.
4187720	4189800	Okay, he keeps taking his hat back, but how do we...
4189800	4193600	Maybe if we wait for him to get his tea, and then he won't get him.
4193600	4196800	Ah, I'm off work.
4196800	4199040	Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, agreed.
4199040	4204640	Okay, let's watch this gentleman try and have his tea.
4204640	4207800	Well, hello there.
4207800	4211240	There's a lady across the fence. Hi! Are you friendly?
4211240	4211920	Probably, no.
4211920	4216120	Is anyone friendly, honestly? I don't think so.
4216120	4218720	Special rules.
4218720	4221280	Oh, ribbon!

4230680	4233120	Man, fuck this thing.
4233120	4236000	I'm putting this one thing in particular. Uh, everything else.
4236000	4238240	Oh, her wee bra's on the line.
4238240	4241360	I know she got wee socks as well.
4241360	4243880	Wah.
4243880	4245800	Uh...
4245800	4250040	I'm stoke. I'm stoke.
4250040	4251760	Hello? No, no, no, no.
4251760	4255840	No, hold on. The camera movement's making me a little bit deezy.
4255840	4257240	Oh, no!
4257240	4260240	Are you feeling a bit sick?
4260240	4262840	Yeah, just give me a moment.
4262840	4265800	If you feel too sick, it's okay. We can post-trap.
4265800	4268160	I ain't gonna force you to play if you feel sick.
4268160	4270840	I didn't realize the camera was so unsteady.
4270840	4274240	Yeah, it was just like...
4275240	4278720	Aw, this is so cute.
4278720	4282040	We can just do this in the film.
4282040	4286600	She's staring at me!
4286600	4289480	Is she gonna break it?
4289480	4291040	No.
4291040	4294320	Oh! Oh my god, let me dress you up!
4294320	4295160	Okay!
4295160	4296560	Oh, wait a minute.
4296560	4298720	Wait, that's our mare's knee.
4298720	4300400	That's literally our bow. That's her entire design.
4300400	4303360	Listen, I have a bow on my chest!
4303400	4305120	Exactly.
4305120	4308720	And technically, your bow and your skirt is your skirt?
4308720	4311400	Yeah, it is on the back of your skirt, as I don't...
4311400	4313600	Oh, there's like a wee frog thing.
4313600	4314720	Oh, a little inter-
4314720	4317440	Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to...
4317440	4321320	Take your thing.
4321320	4324240	Is it a bell?
4324240	4330200	Uh, why do you even have that, lady?
4330200	4332040	Is that how we break the statue?
4332040	4334280	Does she notice I have the bow?
4334280	4336280	No, I notice she doesn't have it, I promise.
4336280	4338400	I have the soap.
4338400	4341000	Wait, this is a bathroom and...
4341000	4344120	This is a garden, it's a bathroom!
4344120	4345720	Uh, no!
4345720	4347400	This isn't a bathtub, lady.
4347400	4349960	This isn't a lifeguard's seat.
4349960	4352600	Aw, no, that's not the meme, why is it?
4352600	4354040	This is a bathtub.
4354040	4356360	This isn't a beach, it's a bathtub!
4356360	4358640	Yes, yes, that's it!
4358640	4361280	What's in the drawer?
4362280	4364280	Oh, sorry about that.
4364280	4369040	Oh, chap, didn't really mean to do that, but hey, hold on, we're here now.
4369040	4373200	I love causing problems on purpose.
4373200	4374760	Whomp, whomp.
4374760	4379720	Whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp.
4379720	4380240	I don't...
4380240	4384120	I assume I can put it on you, essentially.
4384120	4386000	But...
4386000	4388680	What a bizarre...
4388680	4390080	Come here, come here.
4390080	4391760	I can put it on you?
4391760	4393280	I thought I could put it on you.
4393280	4395200	Oh, I'm just joined it from you.
4395200	4397440	Oh, we're just passing it mathematically, excuse me.
4397440	4400880	Oh, we're just like, here you go, no, you have it, no, you have it, no, you have it.
4400880	4403760	You hang up, you hang up, you hang up.
4403760	4407480	Uh, I don't know how to get her to break this.
4409280	4413320	Um, no, she's always gonna have it.
4415240	4419320	She goes to an idol meeting in the open, literally.
4419320	4423280	How, what is, maybe we go in another garden for now.
4423280	4425080	Wait, can we even get out of here?
4425080	4429920	Wait, we can't even get out until we progress through this stage?
4429920	4432960	Our section?
4432960	4436480	There is a gate here.
4436480	4439320	Hello, Mr. Gate.
4439320	4441400	That is not going to work.
4441400	4442120	Can we put this on you?
4442120	4444160	We have...
4444160	4447520	I don't know if you can.
4447520	4449240	I like the way we both look down at it.
4449240	4456120	We're like, hmm, hmm, that's not the way it should be.
4456120	4458360	Okay, why can I not put it on you?
4458360	4465440	Oh, oh, oh, you're so aggressive.
4465440	4469240	No, I'm like trying so hard to put it on you right now.
4469240	4475760	Maybe, oh, wait, wait, wait, oh, maybe if I move the duck, if we move the geese.
4475800	4477400	And you be the duck?
4477400	4481440	Yeah, and I'll be the, I'll be the inch.
4481440	4483120	Oh, I like this idea.
4483120	4486320	And then I stand there and then she puts it on me.
4486320	4492240	Unless you're going to constantly put it.
4492240	4495240	Okay, right, I'll let her pick that up.
4495240	4499520	And then I'm going to yank this away.
4499520	4501640	No, you don't care about this.
4501640	4502680	Okay, look, it's hidden.
4502680	4505480	No, I just clicked off the game and you stopped doing that.
4506480	4510760	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, grab the ribbon, grab the ribbon.
4510760	4511520	Where is it?
4511520	4512080	I'm trying.
4517080	4519520	Oh, no, you've got me, lady.
4519520	4521360	Wait, does she know that?
4521360	4522680	Yeah.
4522680	4524160	She knew.
4526760	4527600	That was.
4527600	4528640	I want the ribbon.
4528640	4529440	Wait, what?
4529440	4532280	How does she know that's not possible?
4532280	4533080	What is on me?
4533080	4534320	Fine.
4534320	4536640	But the game literally says to put her there.
4541200	4543880	The table we broke, something about the table we broke.
4543880	4546680	Hold on, what's up with the table?
4546680	4548280	We're looking at our table now.
4548280	4549640	This one.
4549640	4550880	Oh, it's how we get out.
4550880	4553360	We go up the table now to go into another garden.
4553360	4553760	Oh, OK.
4553760	4556600	You're going to move on to the next one and we can come back to this.
4556600	4562840	We'll come back to the garden as soon as we share the mister.
4562880	4567000	We call her Miss Crackpot because we have to crack her pot.
4567000	4568000	Hi.
4568000	4572720	Do you have a cup of tea by any chance for us little geeseling?
4572720	4575440	We really like your lacrosse.
4575440	4578440	We do.
4578440	4581560	Do you want to have some tea, a bit of tea?
4581560	4582760	No, no tea.
4582760	4584560	OK, jeez.
4584560	4588000	It's hard to impress these people, clearly.
4588000	4591360	Does he have a sip of tea, maybe?
4591400	4594320	Come on, let's watch him.
4594320	4594800	Hello.
4598160	4600240	Hello?
4600240	4602800	He doesn't.
4602800	4605560	He really looking at us like, can I help you?
4605560	4609360	Yeah, actually, you're a mission objective.
4609360	4610200	We're not doing it.
4610200	4611280	We're not up to no good.
4611280	4612880	No.
4612880	4615720	I'm just I'm just crouching around in your garden.
4615720	4617320	I ain't doing nothing.
4617320	4618800	We're doing what we watched.
4618800	4620040	We're watched through the fence.
4620040	4622880	He can't see us, but we can see him.
4622880	4627400	We're we're such we're such bad geese.
4627400	4628960	Literally.
4628960	4630080	What is going on?
4630080	4630720	Night night.
4630720	4633000	Wait, why is he so?
4633000	4635760	Why is he so suspicious?
4635760	4637520	But yeah, he's paranoid.
4637520	4639840	He like can't even enjoy his tea.
4639840	4641480	Come on, drink your tea, sir.
4641480	4643320	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
4643320	4644320	He's rubbing his knees.
4644320	4645320	Rubbing his knees.
4645320	4646320	Yeah.
4646320	4647920	Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
4650480	4654560	No, you're supposed to spell it, my good sir.
4654560	4657600	Did I not give you a fright doing that?
4657600	4658600	All right, take a sip.
4658600	4660160	Take it.
4660160	4662920	Hey.
4662920	4665040	Wait, that was what we wanted?
4665040	4667960	Wait, we wanted him to spit out the tea,
4667960	4670040	so he has to drink the whole thing, I think.
4676240	4676960	Was that not it?
4676960	4678840	No.
4678880	4681000	Steal his shoes.
4681000	4682360	Don't have to tell me to it.
4682360	4683280	Hi.
4683280	4684800	Oh, no, I didn't mean to do that.
4684800	4687360	I meant to steal your loafers, sir.
4687360	4687720	Sorry.
4687720	4689880	Yeah, I'm geeny, damn loafers.
4689880	4690960	Go sit down, sir.
4690960	4691600	Go sit down.
4691600	4692560	I want your shoes.
4695160	4695760	Oh, sorry.
4695760	4698760	Oh, he didn't like that.
4698760	4699720	Look at him.
4699720	4700960	He's taller.
4700960	4704040	Like, he's taller-y in us, but he's kind of not.
4705040	4708040	Uh, what?
4708040	4709040	No.
4711040	4714040	Oh, no, I missed my turn.
4714040	4716040	There, can't get enough, can you?
4716040	4717040	Sucker.
4717040	4718040	No, run.
4718040	4719040	Yeah.
4719040	4720040	Out of bounds.
4720040	4721040	That's right.
4721040	4723040	You aren't coded to come over here.
4723040	4726040	Only I'm coded to come over here, but you?
4726040	4727040	No.
4727040	4730040	Oh, did he just boot me because I took his shoe?
4730040	4733040	You don't deserve it.
4734040	4737040	Maybe use the big bell behind him.
4737040	4738040	Oh!
4738040	4742040	That makes perfect sense, actually, to do the bell when he goes for a sip.
4742040	4745040	Can we see him do a sip from that side?
4745040	4748040	One of us has to go on the other side, I think.
4748040	4753040	I think we, uh, I think we both have to do it or else we can, and...
4753040	4755040	We're back!
4755040	4759040	America Kayo, hello!
4759040	4760040	There he is.
4760040	4761040	Excuse me, madam.
4761040	4762040	I need the bell.
4762040	4764040	You're in my way, madam.
4764040	4767040	Madam, please refrain from getting in my way.
4767040	4768040	Right.
4768040	4769040	Oh, sorry.
4769040	4773040	Okay, that's definitely what you're supposed to do when he sips his tea.
4773040	4778040	We just need to hang around while he does his tea.
4780040	4782040	Okay, we're getting there.
4782040	4784040	We just need our handheld through the game.
4784040	4785040	Just a tiny bit.
4785040	4787040	Okay, just a tiny bit of hand-holding.
4787040	4790040	Right, so we need to wait until he's suspicious.
4790040	4791040	This is over.
4791040	4793040	He shouldn't.
4793040	4798040	He should drink his tea after he's done his, like, suspicious animation.
4802040	4803040	Oh, I'm trapped.
4803040	4804040	I'm trapped.
4804040	4805040	We're good.
4805040	4806040	I didn't...
4806040	4808040	This game is a lot harder than I thought.
4808040	4809040	I thought this was like a...
4809040	4811040	I say this about every game I play.
4811040	4813040	Oh, I thought this was a child's game.
4813040	4814040	Why is it hard?
4814040	4816040	Right, we're like, why is it hard?
4816040	4818040	Right, we're like, why is it hard?
4818040	4820040	Right, we're like, why is it hard?
4821040	4822040	Why is it...
4822040	4824040	No, the bell thing needs to be set up again.
4824040	4826040	She's not fixing it.
4827040	4828040	Oh, no.
4828040	4829040	You're right.
4829040	4830040	Oh, sugar.
4830040	4832040	What is she trying to fix right now?
4833040	4835040	She's currently painting.
4838040	4839040	I don't know.
4839040	4841040	I can take her painting brush.
4841040	4844040	Oh, I can draw her painting brush, one or the other.
4845040	4846040	Oh, wow.
4846040	4847040	Good night, Straniaga.
4847040	4849040	I'll wake up in four hours, bro.
4849040	4850040	You are going to be shattered.
4852040	4854040	Um, no.
4854040	4855040	Was I supposed to take the paper?
4855040	4857040	Oh, she's going to fix the bell.
4858040	4859040	Okay.
4861040	4862040	And then...
4862040	4865040	Do you want to put the duck in the other garden?
4865040	4866040	I wonder if that's what it is.
4866040	4868040	You put the statue in the other garden,
4868040	4871040	so then she forgets she even had a duck.
4872040	4873040	No.
4875040	4876040	No, no, no, no.
4876040	4877040	I must tell you...
4877040	4878040	Okay, there we go.
4878040	4879040	Oh, yeah.
4879040	4880040	Okay, it's now out of bounds,
4880040	4882040	so she can't ask for the duck anymore.
4882040	4883040	It doesn't work like that.
4886040	4890040	And now we wait for him to drink his dang tea
4890040	4894040	that must be frozen solids at this stage.
4894040	4896040	Because there's no way.
4899040	4901040	Please ask for tea.
4901040	4903040	Are you coming in this garden?
4903040	4904040	Yeah.
4904040	4906040	Your audio may be cutting out from me
4906040	4907040	on Discord a little bit.
4907040	4908040	Oh, sorry.
4909040	4911040	No, that was all good, the knee already.
4912040	4915040	So she knows it's fake, right?
4917040	4918040	She tells you to move.
4918040	4920040	Do I need to paint you?
4922040	4924040	So she's fixing that.
4924040	4926040	Wait, can I put the bull on you now
4926040	4928040	because we got rid of the statue?
4929040	4933040	No, I've done...
4933040	4934040	You didn't give me time.
4934040	4935040	Right, go paint.
4935040	4936040	Whoa!
4936040	4937040	Right, go paint.
4937040	4938040	Jeez.
4938040	4939040	Let's do this bail.
4939040	4940040	I want some bourbon.
4940040	4941040	This German.
4941040	4942040	Oh, he's about to do his animation.
4942040	4943040	Okay.
4943040	4944040	No, no, no, wait.
4944040	4945040	No!
4945040	4947040	He was supposed to do the drink tea animation.
4947040	4948040	Why?
4948040	4950040	Maybe this will help your mindset for the puzzle.
4950040	4952040	The game is meant to single player.
4952040	4954040	Everything can be done solo.
4955040	4957040	You mean we could be doing this twice as fast
4957040	4959040	but it's taken us three times as long?
4959040	4960040	Hold on a minute.
4960040	4962040	What's going on here?
4962040	4964040	These allegations.
4964040	4966040	Are you calling us dumb?
4966040	4967040	Why?
4967040	4968040	Because you're right.
4968040	4969040	Cush me.
4969040	4970040	Yeah, I mean, it's not.
4970040	4973040	Wait, water in this dish maybe?
4973040	4975040	I'm like trying to look around for hints,
4975040	4977040	but I'm like, bruv.
4977040	4980040	Stand on the stand when she's not looking.
4981040	4983040	Right, if Mercy's distracting her.
4987040	4990040	Okay, I've stood on the stand.
4991040	4994040	While she's not looking, I am doing no input.
4996040	4998040	As if that was it.
4998040	5001040	That took us so long to get the first thing.
5001040	5003040	Right, he's got tea in his hand.
5003040	5004040	I need to ring the bell.
5006040	5007040	Look at me.
5007040	5008040	I'm Mercy.
5008040	5009040	I have a bow.
5010040	5011040	Ready?
5011040	5012040	Yes!
5013040	5014040	Oh my God.
5015040	5016040	That's fantastic.
5016040	5018040	It took us so long to get one and now we have two.
5018040	5020040	Oh, now you have such a cool ribbon on you.
5021040	5022040	I know.
5022040	5024040	I have a bow like you now.
5026040	5027040	The soap.
5028040	5030040	What do we do with the soap?
5030040	5032040	Why do you have soap outside?
5032040	5034040	Well, she has like a bathtub and a toilet.
5034040	5037040	Quite literally is her decorative stuff.
5037040	5038040	Hold on.
5038040	5039040	Let me check where our objectives are
5039040	5041040	because I've completely forgotten that.
5041040	5042040	Oh, sorry, that's not objectives.
5042040	5045040	Make the man go barefoot and do the washing
5045040	5048040	with a bra, a pair of socks, slippers and a bar soap.
5050040	5052040	Right, hold on a minute.
5053040	5054040	Where would we do washing?
5055040	5057040	Right, I'm going to steal this guy's other loafer.
5057040	5060040	But where do we get water to do the washing?
5062040	5064040	Let's steal his shoe because that's super easy.
5066040	5068040	Hello, we would like to steal your shoe, please.
5070040	5071040	We do the washing in here.
5073040	5075040	No, it's not what it looks like.
5075040	5078040	We're not here for your other loafer at all, I promise.
5079040	5080040	I promise.
5083040	5084040	You can't get me.
5085040	5086040	Out of bounds.
5088040	5089040	Out of bounds.
5089040	5092040	Talk to the game devs because the face ain't listening.
5094040	5095040	Okay.
5095040	5096040	Oh, he won't let me in again.
5096040	5097040	Right, okay.
5097040	5098040	Well, go sit back down.
5098040	5100040	Because now we need to do laundry.
5101040	5103040	I don't really know where to do laundry.
5103040	5105040	Put the vase on the man's side of the garden.
5105040	5107040	The man will throw it back over.
5107040	5109040	Oh, we're just straight up getting spoiled.
5109040	5111040	Are you okay if we get our hand held?
5111040	5114040	Because I don't mind the wreaths and spoiling it for me.
5114040	5117040	Okay, we need to drag the purple statue all the way over.
5119040	5120040	We're back.
5120040	5121040	We can do it.
5124040	5125040	Don't mind me.
5126040	5127040	I'm strapped.
5128040	5130040	I'm not that fast, lady.
5132040	5133040	There you go.
5139040	5141040	I'm stuck on the fence.
5142040	5143040	Let me over.
5143040	5144040	Okay, we did it.
5144040	5145040	Yay.
5145040	5150040	Hello, would you like to throw this magnificent priceless vase over the fence by any chance?
5150040	5151040	Or vase vase?
5151040	5152040	I don't know.
5153040	5154040	Vase?
5154040	5155040	Like Vaseline?
5159040	5161040	He actually did.
5161040	5162040	Oh, he's going to go the other way.
5162040	5163040	Wait, why are you taking me?
5163040	5165040	He just stripped me naked.
5165040	5166040	Give me back.
5167040	5168040	I'm naked.
5169040	5171040	I feel so humiliated.
5172040	5174040	Oh, I guess we do the washing in here.
5174040	5175040	Oh, okay.
5175040	5176040	Because look, there's water.
5176040	5178040	Oh my God, we're swimming.
5178040	5180040	Wait, we need to grab the bar.
5181040	5184040	We need the bra and the sockies.
5184040	5187040	Can I quickly grab it this way?
5189040	5190040	Maybe I can run.
5190040	5191040	No, no.
5191040	5192040	Let's do it this way.
5192040	5195040	If she catches me, it's fine because at least you've got...
5195040	5197040	Wait, she's not even upset about the...
5199040	5200040	Okay, we're doing it.
5200040	5201040	We're doing it.
5201040	5202040	We're doing it.
5202040	5203040	We're doing it.
5203040	5206040	Turns out all we needed was someone to spell it out for us.
5206040	5209040	Wait, no, he's not going to throw that back over.
5209040	5210040	It's in the water now.
5211040	5213040	No, this is mine.
5216040	5217040	It's in the water.
5217040	5218040	No, no, no, no, no.
5218040	5219040	Don't do something.
5220040	5221040	Give me that.
5221040	5223040	It's going in the water for washes.
5223040	5224040	Yeah, that's right.
5224040	5226040	You don't want to stand in this.
5229040	5230040	No, these are mine.
5230040	5232040	There are many things.
5232040	5234040	No, go have your tea.
5234040	5236040	Why aren't you drinking tea a moment ago?
5236040	5237040	Go forget.
5238040	5239040	Forget?
5239040	5241040	No, no, no, no.
5241040	5242040	Hold on.
5242040	5243040	No.
5244040	5246040	Leave Mercy be, you fellow wench.
5248040	5249040	Harlan!
5249040	5251040	Yes, please listen to my problems.
5251040	5254040	Suzuki, life is so hard as a ghost.
5254040	5256040	You see, people don't...
5256040	5258040	Oh, well, you are.
5258040	5260040	As long as one of us picks up, that's the main thing.
5260040	5261040	Grab it.
5261040	5262040	I'm away.
5262040	5263040	I'm away.
5263040	5264040	I'm away.
5264040	5265040	I'm away.
5265040	5266040	I'm away.
5266040	5267040	I'll grab her stuff.
5267040	5268040	No, no, no, no.
5268040	5269040	Stop what it looks like.
5269040	5270040	I promise it's not.
5270040	5271040	Right, hold on.
5271040	5272040	There.
5272040	5274040	I know your neighbor's with that again.
5274040	5276040	Ah.
5276040	5277040	Take this sock.
5277040	5279040	Can you pick up that bar of soap?
5279040	5280040	That's on the bathtub?
5280040	5281040	Yeah.
5281040	5282040	And then we...
5282040	5283040	I think we're done.
5283040	5284040	I think we've done it.
5284040	5285040	Yeah.
5285040	5286040	Taking the clothes.
5286040	5289040	Right, as long as the guy doesn't take a random pair of socks off of us,
5289040	5291040	I don't know why he would care that much,
5291040	5292040	but I don't know where he is.
5292040	5294040	And the camera isn't zoomed out,
5294040	5296040	so I don't know if I'm going to run into him.
5296040	5297040	Is he still...
5297040	5300040	Oh, he's moved the bra out of the freaking thing.
5300040	5302040	Right, let me go get that bra.
5302040	5304040	Do not throw that bra over the fence.
5304040	5306040	Do you understand me?
5306040	5307040	Give me that bra.
5307040	5308040	Give me that bra to me.
5308040	5309040	I need that.
5309040	5311040	I need my training bra, okay?
5311040	5313040	We're doing laundry.
5313040	5315040	Is this what I'm supposed to do?
5315040	5316040	La, la, la, la, la.
5316040	5319040	Wait, this wasn't what I was supposed to do.
5319040	5320040	What is...
5320040	5321040	Do the washing.
5321040	5322040	A slipper!
5322040	5325040	Oh, no, I'll put all the slippers out of bounds.
5325040	5327040	Oh, no, I'm backfired.
5327040	5329040	My plan has backfired terrifically.
5329040	5330040	Hold on.
5330040	5332040	Hold the line, Mercy.
5332040	5333040	Hold the line.
5333040	5335040	I'm coming, Mercy.
5335040	5336040	Distract him.
5336040	5337040	No, no, no, no.
5337040	5338040	Oh, hold the line.
5338040	5339040	Hold the line.
5339040	5340040	Hold the line.
5340040	5341040	I'm coming.
5341040	5342040	I'm coming.
5342040	5343040	Oh, hold the line.
5343040	5344040	Oh, I'm running.
5344040	5345040	I'm running.
5345040	5346040	I'm running.
5346040	5347040	I'm running.
5347040	5348040	I'm running.
5348040	5349040	I'm running.
5350040	5351040	Oh!
5352040	5353040	Yes!
5353040	5354040	Yay!
5354040	5355040	We did it!
5355040	5358040	That was frickin' hard.
5358040	5361040	You didn't make it so hard.
5361040	5362040	God, that camera is so hard.
5362040	5364040	To-do list.
5364040	5366040	Make someone print...
5366040	5367040	The prize, right?
5367040	5368040	The prize.
5368040	5370040	I mean, it looks like he wants to do it.
5370040	5373040	I'm not really wanting to, like, make him do anything.
5373040	5374040	What is he writing?
5374040	5378040	Does that mean he just, like, honk when he's, you know...
5378040	5379040	Oh, he hit me.
5379040	5382040	Did he make a no-geese sign?
5382040	5383040	I think everyone's...
5383040	5387040	Yeah, literally everyone's doing a no-geese every time we're finished in an area.
5387040	5388040	Okay, do this.
5388040	5389040	Right, he can touch the brand stuff.
5389040	5390040	It doesn't matter.
5390040	5391040	How do we...
5391040	5393040	Is there any gardening equipment?
5393040	5394040	Oh, yeah.
5394040	5395040	Oh, yeah.
5395040	5396040	You just closed it on my face, lady.
5396040	5397040	Don't do that again.
5397040	5400040	That made myself clear.
5400040	5402040	Is there gardening tools in here?
5402040	5403040	Hello, lady.
5403040	5404040	Do you have a...
5404040	5405040	The shears?
5405040	5406040	Oh!
5406040	5407040	I see it.
5407040	5408040	And I'm messing it up terribly.
5408040	5410040	Oh, this is quite heavy.
5410040	5411040	I have to...
5411040	5412040	Hold on, lady.
5412040	5413040	Hold on, lady.
5413040	5414040	Give me that.
5414040	5415040	See this paint?
5415040	5417040	Man, I'm terrible at this game.
5417040	5418040	You know that.
5418040	5420040	Can you grab those clippers?
5420040	5421040	Yeah, I'm just gonna...
5421040	5422040	Excuse me.
5422040	5425040	Have you ever heard about our savior, Goose McGooseface?
5425040	5426040	Very good Goose.
5426040	5431040	One of the best Goose that lived for seven years, which is so big in Goose life.
5431040	5432040	It is...
5432040	5434040	Thank you for listening to my story.
5434040	5438040	Is that how you print a rose bush?
5438040	5442040	Well, we're giving them...
5442040	5443040	We...
5443040	5444040	Do we need to...
5444040	5446040	Oh, I need to move it.
5446040	5448040	Oh, yeah.
5448040	5450040	Huh?
5450040	5455040	That didn't do anything.
5455040	5456040	Do we need...
5456040	5460040	Is there a rose bush we need to, like, steal from her garden?
5460040	5465040	Grab the rose pot and drag it next to the shrub, then mess up the shrub.
5465040	5467040	Mess up the shrub.
5467040	5468040	Excuse me, lady.
5468040	5470040	You need to come back in your garden.
5470040	5471040	Man, fuck the shrub.
5471040	5472040	Fuck the shrub.
5472040	5473040	Fuck the shrub.
5473040	5475040	Fuck the shrub.
5475040	5478040	You know that Nicki Minaj song that's like, hi heels on Nicki?
5478040	5479040	Wait, wait, wait.
5479040	5480040	And it goes, fuck the club.
5480040	5481040	Fuck the...
5481040	5484040	Yeah, fuck the shrub.
5484040	5485040	Is that all?
5485040	5488040	I mean, I'm going for it.
5488040	5490040	Wait, he threw the things...
5490040	5493040	Wait, is she going to accidentally chop off the rose?
5493040	5496040	Yeah, looks like she is.
5496040	5500040	Uh...
5500040	5505040	She hid it behind her back.
5505040	5506040	Oh, no.
5506040	5508040	Do you know how long it takes to make roses?
5508040	5514040	It's like a very hard job to have them grow successfully.
5514040	5515040	It takes so long.
5515040	5517040	Right, okay, let's see.
5517040	5518040	We caused a...
5518040	5519040	We caused a problem.
5519040	5520040	Oh, no, he's...
5520040	5522040	Is he crying?
5522040	5524040	He said my rose.
5524040	5527040	He shits the rose, revenge.
5527040	5528040	Right, how do we get out of here?
5528040	5529040	Oh, what's she doing?
5529040	5531040	She's opening a panel.
5531040	5533040	She's letting us go out this panel here.
5533040	5538040	She said I had enough of you, geese.
5538040	5539040	Sorry, are we in the way?
5539040	5540040	Pardon me, lady.
5540040	5544040	I don't know what your plan is.
5544040	5546040	Oh, she got no geese as well.
5546040	5549040	Okay, I actually kind of like that when you're finished with this section,
5549040	5551040	the game's like no goose, by the way.
5551040	5552040	No geese.
5552040	5553040	Okay, okay, I'm out.
5553040	5554040	I'm out.
5554040	5555040	Jeez, I'm done.
5555040	5556040	Yay.
5556040	5557040	Okay, bye.
5557040	5558040	Thank you, lady.
5558040	5559040	What's in here?
5559040	5560040	Hello.
5560040	5562040	Oh, pardon...
5562040	5565040	Oh, sorry, I'm just here to bring...
5565040	5566040	Oh, we're just coming through.
5566040	5567040	Sorry, just visiting.
5567040	5568040	Oh, package.
5568040	5569040	Thank you.
5569040	5570040	Whose package is this?
5570040	5571040	Can we open it?
5571040	5573040	We can take it away with us.
5574040	5579040	We actually don't have an objective, so we're not there yet.
5579040	5581040	Is this the wrong way?
5581040	5583040	I like to steal people's mail.
5583040	5585040	I'm a porch pirate.
5585040	5586040	Look at me.
5586040	5587040	Yarg.
5587040	5588040	Yarg.
5588040	5591040	I'm going to post it in the wrong door on purpose.
5591040	5594040	I'm going to put this one on the other person's door.
5594040	5595040	Yeah, yeah.
5595040	5599040	And then they get to talk and then they'll fall in love or something.
5599040	5601040	Yeah, well, we're so good.
5601040	5602040	We're such good neighbors.
5602040	5604040	Okay, I literally...
5604040	5606040	We need geese everywhere.
5606040	5608040	Geese are actually secretly keepers.
5608040	5610040	You're so helpful.
5610040	5612040	We're writing fan fiction.
5612040	5614040	Look at the lavender.
5614040	5615040	Pretty flowers.
5615040	5617040	We love flowers in this house.
5617040	5620040	You're the prettiest flower I've ever seen.
5620040	5622040	Oh, it's juff.
5622040	5625040	I'm blushing.
5625040	5628040	Oh, the camera angle is swapping every two seconds.
5628040	5629040	Oh my God, there's a Benki!
5629040	5631040	AC is in this game!
5631040	5632040	Not this!
5632040	5633040	Look at the Benki!
5633040	5634040	It's for AC!
5634040	5636040	Oh my God, it's for Benki!
5636040	5639040	Wait, AC needs to play this game now just so she can walk around.
5639040	5641040	Look, you're so cute now.
5641040	5645040	Wait, how do I do AC's voice again?
5645040	5649040	On today, we're going to play Goose Game with Mercy.
5649040	5657040	Thank you, OGSans, for watching me and my kohai, Mercy and the snippets.
5657040	5659040	This is a terrible voice.
5659040	5661040	I cannot do AC at all.
5661040	5662040	I'm trying, okay?
5662040	5663040	I can't do AC.
5663040	5666040	AC is too unique and too cute.
5666040	5669040	Can't do it like a European accent?
5669040	5671040	Is it too hard to mimic European accents?
5671040	5673040	Of any kind.
5673040	5674040	Can you do French?
5674040	5676040	Did you learn French because you know,
5676040	5678040	I didn't really learn French.
5678040	5681040	Bonjour, salut.
5681040	5683040	Like that kind of French.
5683040	5685040	Oh, I've not heard your French voice!
5685040	5688040	I've not heard your French voice before!
5688040	5691040	Salut, merci, ça va?
5691040	5693040	Ça va bien.
5693040	5698040	Wow, your French voice is so cute!
5698040	5702040	To jouer avec moi, on...
5702040	5704040	Oh, we're at the meeting again!
5704040	5706040	Look, it's the rake!
5706040	5710040	Wait, are we done?
5710040	5712040	Did we finish already?
5712040	5714040	No, we couldn't have.
5715040	5717040	No, we've not.
5721040	5723040	Help the woman dress up the boss.
5723040	5727040	Oh no, did we...
5727040	5732040	Wait, no, but she let us go to the next area, so...
5732040	5734040	Are we finished?
5734040	5736040	Oh no!
5736040	5738040	Oh, it makes the ground keepers wear his own hat.
5738040	5740040	We don't have that.
5740040	5744040	But we're allowed to move on?
5744040	5745040	How do we make...
5745040	5747040	You accidentally went back to the beginning of the game.
5747040	5751040	Wait, so we need to go the other way to unlock the new map?
5751040	5755040	Hold on, Ray, let's try the other...
5755040	5757040	Only we would manage that, honestly.
5757040	5759040	Ray, let's try that again.
5759040	5760040	Let's try that again, Ray.
5760040	5761040	We'll go upstream this time.
5761040	5763040	It was the French, I'll burn the French this time.
5763040	5769040	I don't know where the fuck we is.
5769040	5772040	Wait, do we need to go along that bridge there?
5772040	5774040	No, maybe.
5774040	5778040	I'm swimming up the water.
5778040	5781040	To say water in French, you say...
5781040	5783040	L'eau.
5783040	5785040	Why is the French...
5785040	5787040	Why is water male in French?
5787040	5788040	I do not know.
5788040	5789040	No.
5789040	5790040	Can we eat?
5790040	5791040	No.
5791040	5795040	I'm skinny buying that skinny, you know what I'm saying?
5795040	5798040	You think where it matters.
5798040	5800040	Yeah, exactly.
5800040	5801040	That's what I like to hear.
5801040	5802040	Wait, so...
5802040	5806040	We're casually just flirting.
5806040	5809040	I remember seeing complaints like...
5809040	5813040	On feature group collabs, I was just turned into them being nice to each other.
5813040	5814040	What, you're surprised?
5814040	5816040	You're surprised that we're nice?
5816040	5818040	What do you want me mean?
5818040	5820040	Yeah, literally Scots?
5820040	5822040	What do you want me to be like?
5822040	5825040	Oh, you Canadians with your cube costs and all that,
5825040	5827040	and your fake French, like what?
5827040	5831040	Wait, so we weren't supposed to go here or...
5831040	5833040	I thought this was a nice area to go to.
5833040	5835040	What's the deal?
5835040	5838040	This was the way to go, because we opened a gate to get here,
5838040	5840040	and there was a new camera angle.
5840040	5844040	Oh, well, I guess we should move this way now.
5844040	5845040	Moving on up?
5845040	5849040	Maybe it was like a shortcut to go back, I guess?
5849040	5850040	A bit of Bologna.
5850040	5852040	Okay, well, considering...
5852040	5854040	Yeah, there's literally an arrow that's like...
5854040	5856040	You're actually meant to go this way, dumbass.
5856040	5858040	Oh, hey, a car.
5858040	5860040	Let's trap someone in it.
5860040	5862040	Oh.
5862040	5866040	So this is how Mercy lured her first victim.
5866040	5871040	This is how I heard my first victim, right, Senpai?
5871040	5875040	I put in, like, hot girls in your area in this truck,
5875040	5877040	and you just walked in.
5877040	5879040	I can't believe you guys actually responded to that ad.
5879040	5882040	She put up cute Yandere in your area,
5882040	5884040	seeking you now two miles away.
5884040	5887040	She's honing in on your current location.
5887040	5890040	Wait a minute.
5890040	5892040	Whatever objectives.
5892040	5894040	Get into the pub.
5894040	5896040	Break the dartboard.
5896040	5898040	Get the toy boat.
5898040	5900040	Can you say toy boat ten times?
5900040	5901040	Fast?
5901040	5903040	Toy boat?
5903040	5905040	Why?
5905040	5909040	Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
5909040	5912040	Wait, why does it sound like something's on there?
5912040	5914040	Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
5914040	5916040	Toy boat, hey, how do you say toy boat?
5916040	5918040	Toy boat.
5918040	5919040	Toy boat.
5919040	5920040	Toy boat.
5920040	5921040	Toy boat.
5921040	5923040	Toy boat, toy boat.
5923040	5925040	Bit of a toy boat moment.
5925040	5927040	Bit of a toy boat.
5927040	5931040	Like when you say, like, tin soldier or something,
5931040	5933040	and then you're supposed to say it like ten times fast or something.
5933040	5937040	Tin soldier? I've never heard tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier.
5937040	5944040	Oh, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier.
5944040	5946040	Okay, okay, I've not heard that one.
5946040	5949040	I heard like Peter Piper picked a pick.
5949040	5951040	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5951040	5954040	Can you get his shoes? I want your shoes.
5954040	5956040	Oh, go for his laces.
5956040	5958040	Get him where it hurts.
5958040	5959040	Give me that.
5959040	5960040	Yeah.
5960040	5962040	We're terrorizing him.
5962040	5964040	Oh, I can't.
5964040	5966040	This camera angle is so unforgiven.
5966040	5968040	It really is.
5968040	5970040	No, I keep getting pushed away.
5970040	5974040	Do we need to jump in the van and scare them?
5974040	5976040	Jump in the box, maybe.
5976040	5978040	You're right.
5978040	5980040	There should be another box in the van.
5980040	5982040	Let's go into your secret kidnap van.
5982040	5984040	Wait, how do we...
5984040	5986040	We get in the...
5986040	5988040	How do I...
5988040	5990040	How do you...
5990040	5992040	Okay, wait.
5992040	5994040	Oh, no.
5994040	5996040	It's only one at a time, right?
5996040	5998040	You go in before me.
5998040	5999040	I'll be fine.
5999040	6001040	You go in without me.
6001040	6004040	It's okay. We'll cause trouble with leaders.
6004040	6006040	Yes, I think if you burst out of the box, maybe.
6006040	6008040	One of you hide in the box when the woman isn't looking,
6008040	6011040	close the box and wait until the delivery woman picks up the box,
6011040	6013040	she will carry you inside the pub.
6013040	6015040	What about me? I'll just stay outside.
6015040	6017040	I'm literally waiting in line for a queue.
6017040	6020040	I'm pretty sure people have to queue for nightclubs or something like that.
6020040	6022040	I'm queuing to get in the pub right now.
6022040	6024040	I've been to clubs a few times,
6024040	6026040	and I'm just like,
6026040	6028040	that's loud music.
6028040	6030040	It's not for me, mate.
6030040	6032040	Oh!
6032040	6035040	I got these Tism earphones
6035040	6038040	where you put in and it makes everything quieter when you go outside.
6038040	6041040	If you do not have them, they are so good.
6041040	6043040	I cannot recommend them enough.
6043040	6045040	I will literally send you a pair.
6045040	6048040	It makes going outside a heck of a lot easier.
6048040	6050040	Oh!
6050040	6052040	Yes.
6052040	6054040	Be careful. That's goods in there.
6054040	6056040	That's very valuable goods.
6056040	6058040	Do I make myself clear?
6058040	6060040	Do I make myself clear?
6062040	6064040	Okay.
6064040	6066040	There should be another box.
6066040	6068040	Am I going to...
6068040	6070040	Is the camera going to thingy out?
6070040	6072040	Oh no.
6072040	6074040	Can you see yourself?
6074040	6076040	I can't move. I'm stuck.
6076040	6078040	I'm stuck too.
6080040	6082040	Did the game devs...
6082040	6084040	Game devs? Hello game devs?
6084040	6086040	Any game devs?
6086040	6088040	Any hotpatch? Any game dev fixers?
6092040	6094040	That is not good.
6094040	6096040	I'm not sure.
6096040	6098040	I think we might have softlocked ourselves a little bit.
6098040	6100040	I'm not...
6100040	6102040	I'm stuck.
6102040	6104040	I'm stuck.
6104040	6106040	Game bro! Game bro!
6106040	6108040	I'm in! I'm in!
6108040	6110040	That wasn't very nice of me. Where are you?
6110040	6112040	I don't know.
6112040	6114040	Oh no!
6114040	6116040	Where's the grid?
6118040	6120040	Mild panic.
6120040	6122040	How on earth do I get to you?
6122040	6124040	There's a hole in here.
6124040	6126040	Yeah. What do you call me?
6126040	6128040	Oh where is it?
6128040	6130040	I'm reunited.
6130040	6132040	It feels so good.
6132040	6134040	Yunk yunk.
6134040	6136040	Yunk yunk.
6136040	6138040	Yunk yunk.
6138040	6140040	Okay let's destroy that dartboard.
6140040	6142040	Oh yeah! Actually we need to play...
6142040	6144040	Bullseye!
6144040	6146040	190!
6146040	6148040	Oh no no! We're just...
6148040	6150040	We're niceki's.
6150040	6152040	We're niceki's.
6152040	6154040	We're niceki's I promise.
6154040	6156040	We're not... Oh we have little...
6156040	6158040	Game...
6158040	6160040	All the toss the ring stuff.
6160040	6162040	Oh sorry. Were you playing that?
6162040	6164040	Oh sorry. Were you playing?
6164040	6166040	Yeah I think I...
6166040	6168040	Oh that's the dart!
6168040	6170040	That scream out on when he...
6170040	6172040	One, two, three!
6172040	6174040	Oh.
6174040	6176040	I'm sorry for distracting you, Gitzer.
6176040	6178040	How do we destroy that?
6182040	6184040	Oh no I'm sorry!
6186040	6188040	I get to play all harmonica!
6188040	6190040	Hmm.
6190040	6192040	Hmm.
6192040	6194040	How do we destroy a dartboard between us?
6194040	6196040	Maybe cigarette?
6196040	6198040	Maybe we've got something similar?
6198040	6200040	Maybe we've got something similar?
6200040	6202040	Hmm.
6202040	6204040	Yeah.
6208040	6210040	Oh! There's like a little podium!
6210040	6212040	I knight myself the geese of old...
6212040	6214040	Is it a podium?
6214040	6216040	Are they clapping for me?
6216040	6218040	Hello?
6218040	6220040	How do you open your wings?
6220040	6222040	I don't know.
6222040	6224040	Oh my god!
6224040	6226040	They love us!
6228040	6230040	Oh my god!
6230040	6232040	I was joking about this being a podium!
6232040	6234040	But we actually got a flower!
6234040	6236040	That's so cute!
6236040	6238040	Oh my god we're such good kids!
6238040	6240040	We should join a circus.
6240040	6242040	Yes we should join a circus.
6242040	6244040	What?
6244040	6246040	Oh that's so cute.
6246040	6248040	Okay maybe geese girl considered for Gen 2
6248040	6250040	because of how adorable these are.
6250040	6252040	I'm starting to warm up to anyone...
6252040	6254040	Suggestion to a wasp girl.
6254040	6256040	A what?
6256040	6258040	Oh see bug girls are an issue
6258040	6260040	and I'll tell you why I actually developed
6260040	6262040	mental, I don't mind telling you this.
6262040	6264040	Oh really?
6264040	6266040	Because of arachnophobia for example
6266040	6268040	or insectphobia is a very real thing.
6268040	6270040	It has a possibility
6270040	6272040	of putting the girl at a disadvantage.
6272040	6274040	Design wise.
6274040	6276040	Yeah!
6276040	6278040	If you didn't know
6278040	6280040	I don't mind sharing this with you.
6280040	6282040	But you know how you have...
6284040	6286040	Oh that's nice.
6290040	6292040	Oh that's it?
6292040	6294040	That's it no more?
6294040	6296040	Oh my god give them the flower!
6296040	6298040	You were amazing!
6298040	6300040	Oh I can't give them the flower
6300040	6302040	he doesn't like it.
6302040	6304040	You were amazing sir!
6304040	6306040	You wanna play again?
6306040	6308040	Mister?
6308040	6310040	No he just wants to look at us.
6310040	6312040	That's fine.
6312040	6314040	So you know how you have
6314040	6316040	two eyeballs?
6316040	6318040	Yeah.
6318040	6320040	I made sure
6320040	6322040	you had two eyeballs because
6322040	6324040	it's actually really startling
6324040	6326040	if a vtuber only has
6326040	6328040	one eye or is like a mono eye
6328040	6330040	monster girl type thing.
6330040	6332040	It's kind of one of the
6332040	6334040	rules of like
6334040	6336040	development is you can't
6336040	6338040	wait can she see me under the table?
6338040	6340040	You must have a girl
6340040	6342040	with two eyes that isn't too freaky
6342040	6344040	or you're putting them at a severe disadvantage.
6344040	6346040	It kind of goes the same
6346040	6348040	for vtubers that might have
6348040	6350040	multiple eye designs.
6350040	6352040	It's
6352040	6354040	unfortunately just like
6354040	6356040	a weird unwritten rule you're not supposed to do it.
6356040	6358040	What is going on over here?
6358040	6360040	Are we doing the dishes?
6360040	6362040	Oh it's the balls!
6362040	6364040	Oh it's the toy!
6364040	6366040	Ah! Hide under table!
6366040	6368040	Hide under table! Oh no there's no table over here!
6368040	6370040	Leave us alone!
6370040	6372040	Leave me alone I'm scared!
6372040	6374040	I'm just a little guy
6374040	6376040	who wants a knife!
6376040	6378040	Hold on I want this knife.
6378040	6380040	Hold on let me go on.
6380040	6382040	Oh wow she's like chasing me all the way out.
6382040	6384040	Chase me under the table good luck with that.
6386040	6388040	You look very menacing with
6388040	6390040	a knife in your mouth!
6392040	6394040	Oh the knife is underneath you I think.
6394040	6396040	What am I to do with a knife?
6396040	6398040	I don't know I felt like maybe we can destroy
6398040	6400040	the dartboard with the knife.
6400040	6402040	Break the dartboard get the toy boat
6402040	6404040	make the old man fall on his bottom
6404040	6406040	steal a pint glass
6406040	6408040	and drop it in a canal
6408040	6410040	and set the table knife fork plate
6410040	6412040	Oh.
6412040	6414040	Set what table?
6414040	6416040	I'm like proper stuck.
6416040	6418040	Oh what's this?
6418040	6420040	I'm currently getting gridlocked
6420040	6422040	mildly gridlocked.
6422040	6424040	Where are we supposed to set up a table?
6424040	6426040	I don't know.
6426040	6428040	Oh there's like a little underway pathway here.
6428040	6430040	I mean a bug girl doesn't need
6430040	6432040	multiple eyes.
6432040	6434040	It's kind of hard to like
6434040	6436040	Oh my god I'm like
6436040	6438040	Sorry Mercy's currently fighting
6438040	6440040	the owner and I'm like under here like
6440040	6442040	Well actually when it comes to the designs
6442040	6444040	and intricateness of having to produce
6444040	6446040	Emma. Oh no don't shim me I was saying.
6446040	6448040	You can't get me when I'm under
6448040	6450040	the dock.
6454040	6456040	Continue.
6456040	6458040	What table
6458040	6460040	are we supposed to set up?
6460040	6462040	Wait we're meant to make him fall
6462040	6464040	on his bottom. Oh when he goes
6464040	6466040	to play the harmonic we need to move
6466040	6468040	the chair out of the way.
6468040	6470040	Oh that's sad.
6470040	6472040	I don't know I know he seems a bit too old
6472040	6474040	for this.
6474040	6476040	Yeah he's literally already says oh my back hurts.
6476040	6478040	How do we break
6478040	6480040	a dart board truly?
6480040	6482040	Maybe we take a knife and then
6482040	6484040	he throws the knife instead.
6484040	6486040	Is this one supposed to do it?
6486040	6488040	No he notices as soon as
6488040	6490040	I take it.
6490040	6492040	Right so then what's the table we
6492040	6494040	can you pick up the dart?
6494040	6496040	You can.
6500040	6502040	Bunk.
6502040	6504040	Bunk.
6504040	6506040	I don't
6506040	6508040	I don't know.
6508040	6510040	I wanted to play too sir.
6510040	6512040	What the deal is
6512040	6514040	reeflings you're going to have to
6514040	6516040	hold my hand I don't know what we're
6516040	6518040	doing.
6518040	6520040	Oh no no no it's all good
6520040	6522040	it's all good.
6522040	6524040	Uh
6524040	6526040	this is Scalera
6526040	6528040	lens type thing.
6530040	6532040	So when he goes to play the harmonica
6532040	6534040	so basically we have to watch him play
6534040	6536040	darts and then he grabs the harmonica.
6536040	6538040	The table is in the back of the pub
6538040	6540040	where Mercy got stuck at.
6540040	6542040	We need to set a table whilst that person
6542040	6544040	chases us around.
6544040	6546040	That's severe.
6546040	6548040	Biblically accurate
6548040	6550040	Vita for Angel that's actually quite funny.
6552040	6554040	Yeah
6554040	6556040	well you you didn't get a bullseye
6556040	6558040	but that's okay.
6560040	6562040	Move out of the way.
6562040	6564040	I wasn't doing anything.
6564040	6566040	I wasn't doing anything.
6566040	6568040	Yeah yeah.
6572040	6574040	Oh
6574040	6576040	I feel so bad now.
6576040	6578040	Okay he actually recovered from
6578040	6580040	Oh no he didn't.
6580040	6582040	No we're sorry.
6582040	6584040	I wasn't really
6584040	6586040	at our attention but we got it done.
6586040	6588040	Right we need to set a table
6588040	6590040	up here.
6590040	6592040	I'm setting a table.
6592040	6594040	Table table table. What table?
6594040	6596040	Table. This table?
6596040	6598040	That table.
6598040	6600040	The table that
6600040	6602040	Mercy got stuck at.
6602040	6604040	This one? Why yes.
6604040	6606040	I am aware of a table Mercy got stuck
6606040	6608040	at. This one? Surely.
6608040	6610040	I don't
6610040	6612040	I don't see any.
6612040	6614040	The candlestick one.
6614040	6616040	I've been able to pick up the candlestick though.
6618040	6620040	You can't do that with this.
6622040	6624040	I don't
6624040	6626040	leave me alone. I'm just a little goose
6626040	6628040	in a human world.
6628040	6630040	Not there.
6630040	6632040	It is back lift.
6634040	6636040	Follow the path under the deck
6636040	6638040	to get to the back.
6638040	6640040	Wait
6640040	6642040	where Mercy got taken and I couldn't reach?
6642040	6644040	Oh
6644040	6646040	Oh my god.
6646040	6648040	Okay.
6648040	6650040	Let's get these items.
6650040	6652040	Let's get these items.
6652040	6654040	You're chasing me out.
6654040	6656040	Yes shoot shoot. We're out of the cafe.
6656040	6658040	Go away and go do
6658040	6660040	your cafe stuff.
6660040	6662040	Exactly. I'm going to grab some stuff.
6662040	6664040	I'm going to grab anything I can.
6664040	6666040	I got the cup for the table.
6666040	6668040	Are you going to grab something too?
6668040	6670040	Are you feeling risky?
6670040	6672040	Are you feeling risky?
6672040	6674040	I'm going to get chased out.
6674040	6676040	I broke it.
6676040	6678040	Oopsies.
6678040	6680040	Don't chase me out. I need to pick up an item
6680040	6682040	for the table.
6682040	6684040	That's right. I'm hiding under the table.
6684040	6686040	I'm off camera.
6686040	6688040	I'm out. Sorry.
6688040	6690040	It's fine. Pick up that candle.
6690040	6692040	You can pick up that candlestick I think.
6692040	6694040	I want to get the candlestick
6694040	6696040	but I'm stuck now.
6696040	6698040	I'm stuck as well.
6698040	6700040	This freaking video.
6700040	6702040	The distance thing.
6702040	6704040	Oh my god. I'm getting
6704040	6706040	pushed out by the guard as well.
6706040	6708040	Ring the guards.
6708040	6710040	This is the best I can do. Literally be right under you.
6712040	6714040	They did not make this game easy.
6714040	6716040	We're two players.
6716040	6718040	Sorry.
6718040	6720040	Stop chasing me.
6720040	6722040	How is he chasing you out like this?
6722040	6724040	We're literally
6724040	6726040	all the way inside the restaurant.
6726040	6728040	Did the old man
6728040	6730040	tell them?
6730040	6732040	No. Stop looking at me.
6732040	6734040	He is
6734040	6736040	honing in on you. Can you come under the deck?
6736040	6738040	I'm going to try to come under the deck.
6738040	6740040	No.
6740040	6742040	Okay. You're safe.
6742040	6744040	He should go away. Yeah. He said,
6744040	6746040	oh. Rassen for Rassen.
6746040	6748040	And he's going to go get a beer.
6750040	6752040	No.
6752040	6754040	He instantly locks on you.
6754040	6756040	How did he know?
6756040	6758040	That doesn't seem right.
6758040	6760040	That seems too difficult.
6760040	6762040	Follow the...
6762040	6764040	He's so persistent.
6764040	6766040	Poor man can't catch a break.
6766040	6768040	Wait. He's looking for his glass but I broke it.
6770040	6772040	Wait. There's now two people in the cafe area.
6772040	6774040	We need
6774040	6776040	so much stuff from it.
6776040	6778040	Hi.
6778040	6780040	Does he give up?
6780040	6782040	I hope he gives up. Damn.
6782040	6784040	Yeah. Is there anything we can do on this side?
6784040	6786040	I don't think so. I can see the goose sign
6786040	6788040	here. They're going to move it right here.
6788040	6790040	This sign right here. That's the no goose sign.
6790040	6792040	I can tell. I have gamer instinct.
6792040	6794040	There's a plate over here.
6794040	6796040	Wait. There's already a plate here?
6796040	6798040	There is.
6798040	6800040	Okay. We'll take that and then
6800040	6802040	we'll start getting it set up. Is there anything else
6802040	6804040	I can grab? What's this?
6804040	6806040	That's a bucket.
6806040	6808040	Wait.
6808040	6810040	I hope I don't break it.
6810040	6812040	No. I don't... Yeah.
6812040	6814040	Yeah.
6814040	6816040	It's so painy.
6816040	6818040	What?
6818040	6820040	Oh, my face.
6820040	6822040	My face! Ow!
6822040	6824040	My little goose neck just got
6824040	6826040	snapped in half. I can't believe he closed down
6826040	6828040	your face.
6828040	6830040	So red.
6830040	6832040	So what is...
6832040	6834040	We're like...
6834040	6836040	How do you describe the dart bird?
6836040	6838040	I am...
6838040	6840040	Right. I'm going to get the salt shaker.
6840040	6842040	Yeah. Get the salt shaker.
6842040	6844040	Give me this. Give me this.
6844040	6846040	Okay. I said give me this.
6846040	6848040	There we go. Right. And then I'll go on to the table
6848040	6850040	with you and then I'll go down the steps
6850040	6852040	and then I can put it on the little table thing.
6852040	6854040	And then that's one more. I am ticked off
6854040	6856040	of this. Yeah. Jeez. She is
6856040	6858040	feral for us right now.
6858040	6860040	I'm following. I'm following.
6860040	6862040	Is there emotion sickness levels
6862040	6864040	question mark? Oh, bad.
6864040	6866040	Because the camera keeps moving, but...
6866040	6868040	Okay. Do we need to pause?
6868040	6870040	We can always...
6870040	6872040	I'm very sad.
6872040	6874040	I think we've had a good game insertion.
6874040	6876040	We do not actually have to... Yeah, I don't want you
6876040	6878040	to actually be sick
6878040	6880040	by this game.
6880040	6882040	If it's too much, please don't be afraid to say no
6882040	6884040	because I can literally mean and chat
6884040	6886040	and ask questions and stuff.
6886040	6888040	I'm trying. I'm trying to
6888040	6890040	get through it.
6890040	6892040	Okay. How about we finish this
6892040	6894040	goofy level and then maybe call it
6894040	6896040	there because I don't want you to be sick.
6896040	6898040	Yeah. Is she going to be bothered?
6898040	6900040	Yeah. Okay. Well, great.
6900040	6902040	Right. Let's just check the list to make sure
6902040	6904040	we need to steal
6904040	6906040	a glass paint
6906040	6908040	and drop it in the canal. I don't even know
6908040	6910040	where that is. We just need a knife, a fork,
6910040	6912040	and a candle. Okay.
6912040	6914040	Don't worry. There's a candle there.
6914040	6916040	Okay.
6916040	6918040	Oh, she's right there again.
6918040	6920040	Oh, that camera angle.
6920040	6922040	She doesn't bother with us. Does she?
6922040	6924040	No, she's just happy.
6924040	6926040	She's like, what a curiosity.
6926040	6928040	You're breaking up my day.
6928040	6930040	Thank you, little geese for showing up.
6930040	6932040	I was like, oh, you're welcome. Right. Where is this
6932040	6934040	fork?
6934040	6936040	Sugar.
6936040	6938040	She's going to see me.
6938040	6940040	No, no, no, no, no. You don't see me.
6940040	6942040	I am a mystery.
6942040	6944040	Oh, metal bones.
6944040	6946040	No, no, don't push me that way.
6946040	6948040	Mercy's that way.
6948040	6950040	I'm getting pushed out.
6950040	6952040	I'm literally getting pushed out of the camera.
6952040	6954040	I can't bring you closer to the stairs.
6954040	6956040	That's okay.
6956040	6958040	I'm trying to grab the knife.
6958040	6960040	Game devs, you really
6960040	6962040	have done yourself with this one.
6962040	6964040	I think I'm getting shoved.
6964040	6966040	I know you're stuck.
6966040	6968040	I am complete. I can't even see myself.
6968040	6970040	Hold on. Hold on.
6970040	6972040	Hold on. Here we go.
6972040	6974040	Wait, hold on.
6974040	6976040	I need to snipe his shoes, basically.
6980040	6982040	Okay.
6982040	6984040	This isn't...
6984040	6986040	Development team.
6986040	6988040	You need a hand?
6988040	6990040	Yes. Go, tie your lace
6990040	6992040	as it's dangerous to go.
6992040	6994040	Wait, I can't even get past?
6994040	6996040	Bro, you ain't even got...
6996040	6998040	The whole mechanic was that he...
6998040	7000040	You take your shoes off.
7000040	7002040	I'm being trolled so hard this game.
7002040	7004040	Hold on. Let me just move underneath.
7004040	7006040	No, never mind. I'm out of bounds now.
7006040	7008040	Yeah, it keeps...
7008040	7010040	I can't even get past. Okay, there we go.
7010040	7012040	Oh, we did it. We did it. We did it.
7012040	7014040	Go, go, go.
7014040	7016040	No, no, no, don't send me out again.
7016040	7018040	Don't send me out of bounds again.
7020040	7022040	Oh, it doesn't matter because he's chasing you.
7022040	7024040	No, I want my knife.
7024040	7026040	Well, one of us can...
7026040	7028040	I've taken the knife.
7028040	7030040	The knife.
7030040	7032040	Oh, no, no, he's got you.
7032040	7034040	Well, sorry, I'm running.
7036040	7038040	Pick up the knife, please.
7038040	7040040	Okay, there we go. I got it. I got it. I got the knife.
7040040	7042040	Run.
7042040	7044040	Run.
7044040	7046040	Okay, we did it.
7046040	7048040	My controls are not nice.
7048040	7050040	Help!
7050040	7052040	Help!
7052040	7054040	I can't even see you.
7054040	7056040	I can't even see me!
7058040	7060040	Wait, the guy doesn't respond
7060040	7062040	to honking at all?
7062040	7064040	He doesn't care!
7064040	7066040	No!
7066040	7068040	Oh, he sucks.
7068040	7070040	I don't like him.
7070040	7072040	Oh, no, I have made a grave error.
7072040	7074040	Go, I need to go underneath
7074040	7076040	or above either one.
7076040	7078040	No, I'm getting pushed out.
7078040	7080040	He's such a bully.
7080040	7082040	Oh, well, I can just sneak over.
7082040	7084040	Can you maybe run, please?
7084040	7086040	Nice lady.
7086040	7088040	I can't hear until he stops being aggressive on us.
7088040	7090040	He is like the worst.
7090040	7092040	Yeah, darn it.
7092040	7094040	He's not having any of it.
7094040	7096040	No, no, wait, he shouldn't know where it is.
7096040	7098040	I left it on the other side of the fence
7098040	7100040	at the table
7100040	7102040	that we set up so it should be fine.
7102040	7104040	Our knife is...
7104040	7106040	Yeah, go away, mister.
7106040	7108040	Go, go away, mister.
7110040	7112040	Literally, he's so aggressive against us.
7112040	7114040	This is discrimination.
7114040	7116040	I'll be talking to the BBC.
7116040	7118040	Exactly.
7118040	7120040	I'll be doing a report.
7120040	7122040	I'll be getting interviewers out here
7122040	7124040	so everyone can learn of your dastardly...
7124040	7126040	Right.
7126040	7128040	Hide under the table.
7130040	7132040	What's this?
7134040	7136040	What is it?
7136040	7138040	I don't know, but...
7138040	7140040	I'm pulling.
7140040	7142040	Oh my god, it's how I get a beer.
7142040	7144040	Wait, but I don't have a glass.
7144040	7146040	Sugar.
7146040	7148040	Well, I've got a fork.
7148040	7150040	We need to fork anyway.
7150040	7152040	Let me get out of here with this fork.
7152040	7154040	I don't know where the glass of beer is, though.
7154040	7156040	I'm underneath, so she can't get me.
7158040	7160040	I think we broke it.
7160040	7162040	We did.
7162040	7164040	So how on earth did we get...
7164040	7166040	Well, I did.
7166040	7168040	Um...
7168040	7170040	Ah, I knocked it over.
7170040	7172040	No, no, it's okay. I think it still counts.
7172040	7174040	As long as it's on the table, I think it counts.
7174040	7176040	Wow, I'm doing a little 360.
7178040	7180040	All right, it says...
7182040	7184040	A knife and a candle. We actually do have a knife.
7184040	7186040	Oh. Right, we just need a candle.
7186040	7188040	We've done this really awkward part.
7188040	7190040	Why won't it stand?
7192040	7194040	Okay, let's do this approach.
7194040	7196040	There we go.
7196040	7198040	Or do we have to, like, actually set it...
7198040	7200040	Like, the fork goes on the left.
7200040	7202040	The knife goes on the right type stuff.
7202040	7204040	Nah, they wouldn't put that in the game.
7204040	7206040	They wouldn't put that, right?
7206040	7208040	I feel like that's, like...
7208040	7210040	How do you know your knowledge?
7210040	7212040	Well, I cannot pick up the fork.
7212040	7214040	Is it glitched out?
7214040	7216040	It says the fork is there. Okay.
7216040	7218040	It still counts. We've got to get the candle now.
7218040	7220040	This is the candle.
7220040	7222040	And then we're done this terrible back and forth section, I think.
7224040	7226040	Where was the... Hello.
7226040	7228040	Hi. Oh, sorry.
7228040	7230040	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be in your way.
7232040	7234040	Wait, she's pushing me out of the way.
7234040	7236040	Stinky.
7240040	7242040	You want to give me all the attention, lady, don't you?
7242040	7244040	Yes, you do.
7244040	7246040	Where did she put the candle?
7250040	7252040	Is that the best paper again?
7252040	7254040	It may be.
7254040	7258040	I'm just a goose getting all the attention.
7258040	7260040	For no... Oh, I'm stuck on her.
7260040	7262040	For no particular...
7262040	7264040	I'll go under the deck.
7266040	7268040	Yes.
7268040	7270040	Oh, sugar. Okay.
7270040	7272040	You got it.
7272040	7274040	I don't know where she...
7274040	7276040	Oh, my game. My game just closed.
7276040	7278040	Whoa! However, I think you're going to have to come
7278040	7280040	down these stairs and then come underneath with me here.
7280040	7282040	If I don't get chased out, yes.
7282040	7284040	Yeah, come this way, this way.
7284040	7286040	No, no, no, no!
7286040	7288040	Go, go, go, go, go, go!
7288040	7290040	Send it, send it, send it!
7290040	7292040	Okay, okay, I think it's okay.
7292040	7294040	I think it's okay.
7294040	7296040	I've got the candlestick.
7296040	7298040	Oh, no.
7298040	7300040	That's the main thing. As long as we got the candlestick,
7300040	7302040	I can get you back in.
7302040	7304040	All you have to do is unpeel as we...
7304040	7306040	Yeah, you're not coming under here.
7306040	7308040	Oh, wait, why did I hit her?
7308040	7310040	Uh, you might be able to get past...
7310040	7312040	Yeah, you can get back in
7312040	7314040	if I distract him enough.
7314040	7316040	And then come under here with me.
7316040	7318040	No!
7318040	7320040	This guy sucks!
7320040	7322040	Oh!
7322040	7324040	It controls, it controls.
7324040	7326040	Okay, we're safe, we're safe.
7326040	7328040	The heat is now off of us.
7328040	7330040	Oh, you can see my little red flippers.
7330040	7332040	I like my little flip-flops.
7332040	7334040	Okay, he has gone back.
7334040	7336040	I think we can now go to the wee restaurant.
7336040	7338040	The wee restaurant.
7338040	7340040	I'm stuck on something.
7340040	7342040	We casually scroll in.
7342040	7344040	You're stuck?
7344040	7346040	I'm like getting stuck on stuff.
7346040	7348040	There we go.
7348040	7350040	I don't know.
7350040	7352040	Okay, there we go.
7352040	7354040	Wee!
7354040	7356040	We finally frickin' did it!
7356040	7358040	This one was not easy.
7358040	7360040	I think it's the control and the camera.
7360040	7362040	Yeah, this camera angle
7362040	7364040	is spinning around every two seconds.
7364040	7366040	Oh, I'm stuck again.
7366040	7368040	Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
7368040	7370040	Is that vomit burp?
7370040	7372040	I'm getting nervous.
7372040	7374040	It was the motion sickness burp.
7374040	7376040	I'm so sorry, excuse me.
7376040	7378040	Actually, we can stop.
7378040	7380040	I didn't know when you just hop on our first collab.
7380040	7382040	Because we picked up this motion.
7382040	7384040	Okay, if that was a vomit burp,
7384040	7386040	I'm happy to say we have set the table.
7386040	7388040	Yeah, we set the table.
7388040	7390040	Okay, I am not going to make you play anymore.
7390040	7392040	I really do not.
7392040	7394040	Any issues?
7394040	7396040	Okay.
7396040	7398040	We will say thank you so so much
7398040	7400040	for letting us have
7400040	7402040	an absolute carry on.
7402040	7404040	Unfortunately, we thank you.
7404040	7406040	I stupendously
7406040	7408040	asked her to
7408040	7410040	play a motion sickness
7410040	7412040	and juicing game. I had no idea
7412040	7414040	that the camera angle was so violent
7414040	7416040	towards her, per mercy.
7416040	7418040	But I think
7418040	7420040	I'm happy to say we'll end it there.
7420040	7422040	I don't want any vomit.
7422040	7424040	Okay, that's the bottom line.
7424040	7426040	Okay, that's the bottom line.
7426040	7428040	No vomit please.
7428040	7430040	I'm sorry.
7430040	7432040	No, don't be sorry.
7432040	7434040	I was like, oh, it was so good.
7434040	7436040	I haven't burped yet on stream.
7436040	7438040	Oops.
7438040	7440040	We'll play it safe.
7440040	7442040	Please do not worry. Let's play nice and safe.
7442040	7444040	We will say to the snippets
7444040	7446040	and the reeflings. Thank you so so much
7446040	7448040	for watching.
7448040	7450040	I am streaming again tomorrow.
7450040	7452040	Merci. Are you streaming tomorrow?
7452040	7454040	Is the real question?
7454040	7456040	No, I place my day off.
7456040	7458040	Well, I'll put her to work
7458040	7460040	lads. Don't you worry.
7460040	7462040	I'll make an ASMR for her to put her to work.
7462040	7464040	Don't you worry about that.
7464040	7466040	Teasing. Teasing.
7466040	7468040	She'll have a break.
7468040	7470040	We will leave it there
7470040	7472040	and I'm going to let you know
7472040	7474040	that we're going to be playing
7474040	7476040	a motion sickness game.
7476040	7478040	We'll leave it there
7478040	7480040	and I'm going to let Merci lie down
7480040	7482040	because I think she needs a good nap
7482040	7484040	or maybe a big lie down
7484040	7486040	and some fizzy juice to help her feel a bit better.
7486040	7488040	But thank you so so much
7488040	7490040	for joining me, Merci. I appreciate that so much.
7490040	7492040	And that was actually genuinely really fun.
7492040	7494040	So much fun.
7494040	7496040	As chaotic as that game was,
7496040	7498040	that was actually hilarious that you
7498040	7500040	started controlling my goose.
7500040	7502040	Wow, yandere powers.
7502040	7504040	Literally.
7504040	7506040	That was supposed to be that most of this one here.
7506040	7508040	Right. Thank you so so much.
7508040	7510040	Thank you everyone.
7510040	7512040	I'm going to end a little strum.
7512040	7514040	Oh wait, no, no one's streaming
7514040	7516040	because you're the one that normally streams lads.
7516040	7518040	Should I?
7518040	7520040	Let's see if there's someone on you.
7520040	7522040	Let me check with one of the girls.
7522040	7524040	Let me check if I can find it.
7524040	7526040	Azura rated it in a U.S.
7526040	7528040	That means she finished her cheeky stream,
7528040	7530040	her cheeky bricky stream.
7530040	7532040	There are some girls
7532040	7534040	on. There's Rain
7534040	7536040	from Ume Plus
7536040	7538040	and a bunch of
7538040	7540040	VNU girls are on too.
7540040	7542040	I have not
7546040	7548040	I will do Rae from
7548040	7550040	Thingy because I don't think she's monetized yet.
7550040	7552040	She will watch Time.
7552040	7554040	Yeah, let's Rae into Rain.
7554040	7556040	I will Rae into Rae. She's doing
7556040	7558040	unicorn overload, number two,
7558040	7560040	shipping characters to fight better.
7560040	7562040	This one's like a
7562040	7564040	vanilla wear game.
7564040	7566040	It's supposed to be really good.
7566040	7568040	Have you played it before?
7568040	7570040	No, I haven't.
7570040	7572040	But I'm a fan of vanilla wear
7572040	7574040	games.
7574040	7576040	That's cute.
7576040	7578040	Thank you so much, Sneeflings.
7578040	7580040	Thank you so much, Mersey, for joining me.
7580040	7582040	Please do get some serious rest
7582040	7584040	because I do not want any.
7584040	7586040	How terrible is that headline?
7586040	7588040	Collab
7588040	7590040	results in like vomit.
7590040	7592040	What kind of collab is going on
7592040	7594040	if that's the case?
7594040	7596040	Thank you.
7596040	7598040	I missed some soupas.
7598040	7600040	Thank you so much.
7600040	7602040	Misaka best for the
7602040	7604040	420 blazes.
7604040	7606040	Stop goose hate. Thank you so much
7606040	7608040	for the tip you with me.
7608040	7610040	Thank you.
7612040	7614040	For the five dollar
7614040	7616040	super chat. Did you know Rick
7616040	7618040	Ashley is never going to give you up.
7618040	7620040	Never going to let you down.
7620040	7622040	Never going to let you down
7622040	7624040	twice. Never going to run around
7624040	7626040	and desert you. Yes, I knew that.
7626040	7628040	Thank you so much for the five.
7628040	7630040	Wow.
7630040	7632040	Thank you so much, everyone
7632040	7634040	for such a wonderful stream
7634040	7636040	and thank you.
7636040	7638040	It was unexpected that
7638040	7640040	we hit such a
7640040	7642040	dizzy game.
7642040	7644040	We got so close though,
7644040	7646040	but I would not have picked that game
7646040	7648040	had I known how spinny camera it was.
7648040	7650040	I thought it was
7650040	7652040	a straightforward linear
7652040	7654040	experience. So I do apologize for that
7654040	7656040	oversight, Mercy. It's okay.
7656040	7658040	Honestly, everything looked
7658040	7660040	like it was going to be fine, but like
7660040	7662040	yeah, that was
7662040	7664040	every time we entered or moved around
7664040	7666040	somewhere, the camera just like violently
7666040	7668040	spins over.
7668040	7670040	Sorry to anyone that also has
7670040	7672040	motion sickness watching. You probably feel like
7672040	7674040	right now.
7676040	7678040	Okay.
7678040	7680040	Right.
7680040	7682040	I will let you get going.
7682040	7684040	Thank you so much, Mercy.
7684040	7686040	Let's put it to the end stream
7686040	7688040	and then we're right into rain.
7688040	7690040	Yeah. Yes.
7690040	7692040	Okay, I'm end streamed. Bye bye, replays.
7692040	7694040	Bye bye.
7698040	7700040	In the broadcast.
7702040	7704040	Successfully.
