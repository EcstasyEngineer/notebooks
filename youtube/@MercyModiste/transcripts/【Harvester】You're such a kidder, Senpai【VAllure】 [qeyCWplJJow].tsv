330000	350000	and
350000	379120	Hello everyone, hello Senpai, welcome to the stream.
380120	391120	We're back at it again with Harvesturder.
391120	399120	Sorry, I'm a slightly bit late, I'm slightly bit late, I had an idle meeting.
399120	411120	Thank you for Griffin, for the 10 gifted, and welcome to member, member, and Iago.
411120	418120	Welcome to member, lord, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Rock.
418120	424120	Well, I can't read. How are you feeling? My arm is still itchy.
424120	432120	So we're going to be playing kind of, not aggressively.
432120	435120	Now we're going to play not that aggressively.
435120	440120	Are you doing better? Let me check my arm.
440120	447120	There's some patches that are cleared up, but there's some parts that are still pretty bumpy and gross.
447120	465120	And it's, yeah, I have an appointment, I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday, that's the earliest she can see me, I think.
465120	477120	And so we're going to check that out, but watch as like my rash goes away by Monday.
477120	490120	It's LB really, it's always like that, right? It's always like that, it always, it always goes away by the time you get to the appointment.
490120	495120	But yeah, it's been a couple of days now. This morning it was flaring up really badly.
495120	503120	So I had to push, put my like bedsheets and stuff to the wash, so I have no blanket today.
503120	519120	So I've turned on, I've turned on my streaming lights, because sometimes I don't turn them on, but today I'm turning them on, so it's extra warm in the cages and in the basement.
519120	542120	So we're going to continue playing, playing, I don't remember if I have anything else to say, other than I want to just double check the instructions to see if I remember it.
542120	558120	Oh, and I got in the new mouse, the new mouse that Senpai gifted, so now I have a mouse that actually works, and not a mouse that disconnects every moment.
558120	570120	So now I can like move it nice. It fits my hand too.
570120	579120	It fits my hand, so now I've got a nice mouse to play my point and click games.
579120	583120	Okay, let's see, left button to move.
583120	596120	I'm going to start on a puzzle, avoid cliches, crazy logical.
596120	599120	Okay, I think we're good.
599120	602120	Yeah, that was punch.
602120	605120	Double click to open stuff.
605120	609120	Okay, yeah, we're good, we're good, we're good Senpai.
609120	614120	So now we just have to load our last save file.
614120	621120	Which is Senpai, I love you, I think that's the one.
621120	626120	Now you can play a difficult game about climbing.
626120	629120	I think I was too frustrated with that.
629120	633120	Okay, nothing else in here.
633120	636120	Look at my stinking brother.
636120	639120	Give me the paper.
639120	644120	I don't want to talk to him, but he gives so much hints.
644120	647120	He gives so much hints.
663120	666120	And twitched and drew up.
666120	669120	I guess I got my answer.
669120	671120	This is why I hate you.
671120	676120	Hate! Hate!
676120	677120	Hate!
677120	678120	Say what?
678120	681120	Yeah, yeah, I said I hate you.
681120	685120	Yeah, my little brother.
685120	687120	Little brother, hate.
687120	689120	Little sister.
689120	696120	Okay, little brother, hate.
696120	698120	Hate, Trid.
698120	704120	I'm in Sparky's super foamy fire extinguisher.
704120	707120	A new boy in his sleeping soundly.
707120	710120	Hello, mother.
710120	712120	Hello dear, how are you today?
712120	715120	You know those firemen, the funny ones with the color sense.
715120	718120	Looks like they misplaced a bolt of expensive fabric.
718120	721120	Of course, each one of them suspects the other.
721120	723120	Looks like a cat fight is brewing.
723120	725120	Congratulations, hero.
725120	727120	You found Karen after all.
727120	728120	You don't seem proud, mother.
728120	730120	You don't seem proud, yeah.
730120	732120	I warned you not to waste time looking for her.
732120	734120	Am I running out of time?
734120	736120	The blood drive is coming soon.
736120	738120	What does that have to do with anything?
738120	740120	Yeah, why does that have to do with anything?
740120	743120	Thank you, Vincent, for remembering.
743120	746120	Still, I'm glad you found the poor baby.
746120	752120	She says Mr. Potsdam was responsible for what happened to her.
752120	754120	Yeah, I knew it.
758120	760120	I can't believe Potsdam would do something.
760120	761120	I believe her.
761120	762120	Shame on you.
762120	763120	Fuck you.
763120	766120	Imagine accusing your future father-in-law of a thing like that.
766120	768120	Is that how a rain-dryer would behave?
768120	770120	I don't think so.
770120	772120	Why would she lie?
772120	773120	Why would she lie?
773120	776120	Mr. Eisenheimer, even if he is a child,
776120	778120	molester, a kidnapper, and an attempted murderer
778120	780120	Molester, a kidnapper, and an attempted murderer?
780120	782120	What kind of father-in-law he'll be?
782120	783120	What?!

1871840	1876160	Stephanie what happened what happened the only town folk
1876160	1880720	that I care about is Karen and her mother and maybe the shopkeeper because the

2555200	2562000	amic amicable yeah yeah my all my jobs have been like kind of like amicable
2563120	2571520	believing
2571520	2577920	um
2580080	2583680	without losing your job you wouldn't be able to lock us in cages
2584320	2587200	yeah now I have better ways of locking senpai in cages
2591440	2593920	let's see my last job was
2594480	2602960	my last job was what do you call it real estate
2605600	2606800	it was real estate
2610080	2616320	yeah scouting out locations and all those empty houses
2624320	2628720	did you find the mystical free real estate no I did not
2631760	2636160	was it fun sort of it was fun I learned a lot
2640160	2643600	I learned a lot but I definitely
2646720	2652640	wouldn't do it again oh maybe I would or maybe I would you know if the opportunity arises I
2652640	2660160	probably would do it again if like if for some reason if for some reason I cannot make a living
2661120	2668240	here or I'm not working hard enough or something I'll probably take another additional job maybe in
2668240	2674640	real estate again I learned how bad the housing market is yes I learned and I learned there are
2674640	2685760	so many people who are ridiculously rich like there's some processes where when in real estate
2685760	2692160	you know you're just kind of like they're like I want to play pay the whole the whole thing now
2692160	2701600	I'm like technically we can't sell you this without you know without some more papers
2706400	2712000	and then they go and then they go but I want to pay the whole thing right now in cash and I go
2712960	2716160	that's nice we can't do that
2716160	2724160	a full buyout yeah yeah yeah but they wanted to do in cash and that's not
2725520	2730080	it's really a lot of the pay paperwork would be way more complex than it is
2732960	2736880	and like the house that they wanted to buy was was a big house
2737520	2747280	was a big house can I say it can I say the cost of the house
2749360	2751520	anyways it's a big house it was uh
2754480	2756960	let's say it was over one million
2763040	2764160	it was a big house
2767760	2771120	and they were like I want to pay in cash and I was like
2775040	2775440	um
2778000	2781200	I can't do that I can't do that
2783440	2784960	do you get a cut of it no
2789840	2791520	no because I didn't sell to them
2792160	2800320	what exactly is wrong with paying in cash is because we need the paperwork and the paperwork
2800320	2805920	usually requires like a lot more steps than just paying out full in full cash right because you
2805920	2814000	have property and then you have the lawyer stuff and then you have bank notes and stuff and of
2814000	2818720	course you need like a line of credit blah blah blah blah blah it's a lot to buy a house
2821680	2828080	it's a lot to buy a house and it's like and title BS and then you have to like transfer transfer
2828080	2837760	titles and stuff the implication of paying on cash is that you don't do paperwork but the thing is
2837760	2847520	that like if I get paid in all cash it would be like you know people will start suspecting something
2848160	2853280	and then it will go into a whole investigation and that's another whole load of like paperwork
2855760	2856000	yeah
2856000	2866160	oh sorry I missed the two super chats oh I need to feed me herself now
2866720	2872960	I'll throw you a bone and can I stay out of the k can I stay in the cage for free now
2873600	2878240	I thought who's been paying rent should I have been charging rent for these cages
2886720	2888080	who's charging rent
2900400	2902720	the landlord me no wrong it's me
2906560	2914080	damn found out half of half of the uh half of the senpais are mysteriously gone next day
2914720	2916240	watch
2925680	2931680	okay I guess I guess if it's strongy if it's strongy then I guess that's okay
2933360	2934320	I guess it's okay
2937200	2940240	yeah strongy has been charging rent to fund VLR success
2944800	2953360	but I'm pretty sure I didn't I didn't charge rent that's why I've been saying that I'm so nice to you
2961120	2967200	no I've been paying I've been so nice to you I've been housing all my senpais in this cage
2968800	2969600	then sometimes
2974080	2976320	although if it is strongy then um I guess
2983120	2985600	I guess that it is what it is
2993840	2998320	but I saved up for a whole year to afford this one square foot cage
3004640	3010880	but yeah um gosh well I've been yapping right anyways um
3012960	3021120	it seems highly illegal and I don't want to like you know I don't want to be investigated for
3021120	3025920	for I don't know assisting a crime or something you know what I'm saying
3026960	3032960	senpai I don't want to I don't want to leave a trail I already know how to not leave a trail so
3034080	3038960	um why would I why would I accept one million cash you know
3044080	3049280	so yeah I was like okay well here's the steps you need to take before buying the house
3054240	3060160	and you know that's what I did that's what I did I uh I gave them a list of what they needed to do
3060800	3064400	before they they could buy the house and then they never bought the house
3066080	3069360	and besides one more thing one more thing and uh one more thing
3070080	3075920	we don't know if the cash is real or not it could be printed printed like you know fakes
3075920	3088160	so
3089920	3094400	yeah like you you never know right that's why you gotta be like okay well in cash
3097120	3101840	that's kind of suspect uh so I want to go through the regular avenues for this house
3106000	3113600	so I was like no no no no no no no now
3119200	3122400	mercy do your best colombo impression that was my best colombo impression
3124880	3130640	yeah I have to follow the rules the housing market is like there's a lot of rules for housing
3130640	3134160	and stuff so if I don't follow all of them I get in trouble
3140560	3144400	I get in trouble otherwise but then the rules
3146240	3149120	then the rules you can't you can't you know
3151200	3157200	you can't really just buy a house I don't know where it is a little bit of work maybe
3157520	3161120	the fastest you can do is probably a day
3163680	3167520	but you gotta have to yeah you have you have to um
3169520	3174160	but then I'd have to work my ass off I have to work my ass off to get all the paperwork done
3174160	3180160	to do like in a day so that's that's like um
3180960	3188000	it is how it is anyways sorry me starting to think about the housing market and I'm like
3188000	3192800	man I want my own place and then I look at the places that like it gets sold and I'm like oh

5269200	5271200	We don't practice corporal punishment here.
5271200	5273200	I've never believed in that old adage.
5273200	5275200	Spare the rod and spoil the child.
5275200	5277200	A rod is too thin.
5277200	5279200	But a baseball bat
5279200	5283200	That bridges the generation gap quite nicely.
5283200	5285200	Okay
5287200	5289200	Okay, okay.
5289200	5291200	Stay quick
5295200	5297200	Not again

5301200	5303200	Bye bye
5305200	5307200	Can I, can I grab the bat?
5307200	5309200	No
5309200	5311200	I feel like I'm supposed to do something before night time.
5311200	5313200	I wonder how to do that.
5315200	5317200	The door's locked.
5319200	5321200	Is this it?
5321200	5323200	No
5323200	5325200	Oof.
5325200	5327200	Didn't mean to do that.
5327200	5329200	This has to be the closet, right?
5333200	5335200	Try the pulse badge?
5341200	5345200	I feel like I was supposed to use the blackmail him but I uh...
5349200	5351200	My button
5351200	5353200	Why I lost that months ago, where did you find it?
5353200	5355200	Funny thing that
5355200	5357200	I found it in the ashes
5357200	5359200	At the newspaper building
5359200	5361200	What are you implying?
5361200	5363200	That I had something to do with setting the fire?
5363200	5365200	Preposterous.
5365200	5367200	Why a hundred people must have visited that site since the fire?
5373200	5375200	But none of them had buttons like this.
5375200	5377200	You just try showing that button to Sheriff.
5377200	5379200	Oh yeah?
5381200	5383200	Button
5399200	5401200	Wait, can I see that again? Okay
5403200	5405200	Bye
5405200	5407200	Do I still have the button?
5407200	5409200	Okay
5409200	5411200	Okay
5417200	5419200	Do I go to the officer then?
5427200	5429200	I don't know
5435200	5437200	Can I use the screwdriver?
5445200	5447200	Damn it

5457200	5459200	Okay, well that didn't work
5459200	5461200	Electrical tape for the wire
5461200	5463200	Damn it
5463200	5465200	Wait, where did it go? Did I put it back in myself?
5465200	5467200	Yeah, I did

5485200	5487200	Okay

5497200	5499200	Maybe I should do this at night time
5503200	5505200	Night time, night time
5515200	5517200	Can I really not go on the fire station?
5517200	5519200	Maybe I can do it at night time
5523200	5525200	How do we skip time?
5525200	5527200	Yeah, I don't know how, I feel like I need to do something
5529200	5531200	Before

5537200	5539200	Yeah

5701200	5703200	when you get to the fire station
5703200	5705200	I don't think we can go to the fire station
5705200	5707200	unless it's night time
5707200	5709200	Maybe I'll go back to the lodge again
5709200	5711200	and be like, what's up?

7259200	7261200	We're good
7267200	7269200	Did you hear what happened at the barber shop?
7269200	7271200	Someone broke into Pastorelli's salon
7271200	7273200	and took his antique barber's pole
7273200	7275200	The next morning Pastorelli
7275200	7277200	touched some live wires that the thief left lying around
7277200	7279200	and was electrocuted
7279200	7281200	Well that darn foreigner got what he deserved
7281200	7283200	if you ask me
7283200	7285200	coming into a nice little town like harvest
7285200	7287200	and stealing business
7287200	7289200	Heavens if a bow and scissors
7289200	7291200	were good enough for your father
7291200	7293200	I don't see why decent working folk
7293200	7295200	need a fancy wop styling their hair
7295200	7297200	That's how it goes
7297200	7299200	First you get a sissy trim then bang
7299200	7301200	You're a communist
7301200	7303200	Isn't it exciting Steve?
7303200	7305200	Five days and twelve hundred cookies later
7305200	7307200	the bake sale is already here
7307200	7309200	Where does the time fly?
7309200	7311200	Those one thousand
7311200	7313200	two hundred cookies
7313200	7315200	Senpai
7315200	7317200	Oh about twenty
7317200	7319200	the rest were stale
7319200	7321200	but the effort wasn't wasted it's for a good cause
7321200	7323200	Will you be at the school tonight?
7325200	7327200	Wouldn't miss it
7327200	7329200	That's nice dear
7329200	7331200	It's good to be open to new experiences
7331200	7333200	Oh my gosh
7337200	7339200	No wonder your hair is terrible ma'am
7341200	7343200	That was definitely

7393200	7395200	a protest
7395200	7397200	against censorship

7565200	7567200	The bake sale is tonight

7573200	7575200	Guards of floss okay bye

7581200	7583200	Why did I do that
7585200	7587200	I'm so sad
7603200	7605200	He can't be saved
7607200	7609200	That's okay
7615200	7617200	I don't know
7619200	7621200	I see my mother throwing out whole batches
7621200	7623200	of cookies like an automaton
7623200	7625200	getting rid of its surplus product
7625200	7627200	My so called mother has been baking
7627200	7629200	cookies all week and then
7629200	7631200	throwing them out better that
7631200	7633200	than getting rid of us
7633200	7635200	Wait around long enough
7635200	7637200	I have a feeling they'll get to it
7639200	7641200	I don't know if you heard or not
7641200	7643200	but Mr. Pastor Ali the barber
7643200	7645200	He's dead
7645200	7647200	Looks like somebody stole
7647200	7649200	a barber's pole from him
7649200	7651200	Then left the exposed electrical wires
7651200	7653200	and some water on the floor
7653200	7655200	Pastor Ali walked in flipped on the lights
7655200	7657200	and
7657200	7659200	No anything about that
7659200	7661200	No
7663200	7665200	Okay fine I didn't mean to kill him
7665200	7667200	I just wanted the pole for the initiation
7667200	7669200	Fuck it, fuck it we did this
7669200	7671200	That was our bed
7673200	7675200	Like a man died
7675200	7677200	I didn't know
7677200	7679200	I forgot about the live wires
7679200	7681200	and the water
7681200	7683200	That doesn't change the fact that you killed him
7683200	7685200	This initiation killed him
7685200	7687200	It was just an accident
7689200	7691200	It was just like some time
7691200	7693200	where I
7693200	7695200	Don't you see
7695200	7697200	I'm beginning to think that the lodge
7697200	7699200	poisons everything it touches
7699200	7701200	Harvest
7701200	7703200	I didn't create this situation
7703200	7705200	Are you sure
7705200	7707200	No
7707200	7709200	But however it started
7709200	7711200	I'm gonna see it through to the end
7711200	7713200	Vandalism theft
7713200	7715200	Manslaughter
7715200	7717200	What's next Steve, murder
7717200	7719200	Second
7719200	7721200	I know in the beginning I suggested you might check out the lodge
7721200	7723200	I was more worried about getting out of here
7723200	7725200	than anything else
7725200	7727200	But now that I know you
7727200	7729200	I'm worried about you too
7729200	7731200	I'm fine
7735200	7737200	I'm not fine
7759200	7761200	Come back and visit me soon
7761200	7763200	You can't just ask that after
7763200	7765200	After doing that to me
7765200	7767200	You can't just ask that
7767200	7769200	I know I understand
7769200	7771200	Sometimes sometimes
7771200	7773200	You know
7773200	7775200	Sometimes sometimes just force my hand sometimes
7775200	7777200	And then I just have to
7777200	7779200	I just have to
7781200	7783200	Yeah
7783200	7785200	I know it happens to the best of us
7785200	7787200	I didn't mean it though
7789200	7791200	I didn't mean it
7791200	7793200	Sometimes Senpai just walks into my knife
7793200	7795200	And my scissors
7795200	7797200	And my bat
7797200	7799200	And my
7799200	7801200	And the barrel
7801200	7803200	The bone saw was me though
7803200	7805200	But yeah
7805200	7807200	You sometimes just walk into all of them
7813200	7815200	And here it is
7815200	7817200	The object dog
7817200	7819200	The guard
7819200	7821200	Imported Phoenician glass
7821200	7823200	And Italian dreams
7823200	7825200	Italian dreams
7825200	7827200	An unfortunate side effect
7827200	7829200	That pastorelli was
7829200	7831200	electrocuted because
7831200	7833200	You left live wires
7833200	7835200	In a puddle
7835200	7837200	I didn't know there was a puddle
7837200	7839200	The stations of worldliness say
7839200	7841200	Say love you
7847200	7849200	Oh you can say it man it was electrocuted
7849200	7851200	Pastorelli's own incompetence
7851200	7853200	Caused his unfortunate
7853200	7855200	Accent
7855200	7857200	Maybe his incompetence
7857200	7859200	I had
7859200	7861200	You left live electrical wires
7861200	7863200	Hanging in the water
7863200	7865200	On the floor
7865200	7867200	Cross wired the alarm system
7867200	7869200	To the sprinklers
7869200	7871200	He'd be live today
7871200	7873200	Of course
7873200	7875200	You only wanted the pole
7875200	7877200	But that hardly matters now
7877200	7879200	But he turned on the light
7885200	7887200	What?
7889200	7891200	What?
7891200	7893200	What?
7893200	7895200	What do we have to do?
7895200	7897200	No not the nice lady
7897200	7899200	And her daughter's diner
7901200	7903200	Not the diner everybody eats
7903200	7905200	There
7905200	7907200	Not the French
7907200	7909200	They're not French
7909200	7911200	Are they?
7913200	7915200	They're not French are they?
7915200	7917200	Oh no oh no
7917200	7919200	Does that mean we have to fry
7919200	7921200	That means French
7921200	7923200	French Canadian
7925200	7927200	Oui oui
7927200	7929200	Ah sacre ble
7933200	7935200	And
7937200	7939200	Ah sacre ble
7939200	7941200	Ah
7947200	7949200	Ah whatever
7949200	7951200	That's no minor prank
7951200	7953200	So close
7953200	7955200	And yet so far
7955200	7957200	What a pity
7957200	7959200	Tonight
7959200	7961200	The big sale
7961200	7963200	What do you mean docks
7963200	7965200	That was on her debut
7969200	7971200	When sacrifice will be
7971200	7973200	The order of the day
7973200	7975200	What?
7979200	7981200	What?
7981200	7983200	Okay repeat this
7985200	7987200	Okay pastor only took a big spill
7987200	7989200	A permanent one
7999200	8001200	Alright any suggestions?
8019200	8021200	So
8021200	8023200	You know
8023200	8025200	He just went
8025200	8027200	Okay I gotta move the window
8027200	8029200	Up a little bit I can't get out of here
8029200	8031200	Without it moved
8031200	8033200	There it is
8037200	8039200	Um
8045200	8047200	I have to set fire
8047200	8049200	To that nice ladies
8049200	8051200	Diner
8051200	8053200	Bye bye
8053200	8055200	I can't talk now
8055200	8057200	The dishes are stacked up in back
8057200	8059200	And I better take advantage of the lull
8059200	8061200	I've whipped up a huge batch of brownies
8061200	8063200	For the PTA bake sale tonight
8063200	8065200	I just wish I could do more
8065200	8067200	To help out those poor bums
8069200	8071200	How will this sale help bums?
8071200	8073200	Most of the bums that die in harvest
8073200	8075200	Lack the money for a good Christian burial
8075200	8077200	The proceeds from this sale
8077200	8079200	Will help Mr Moynihan provide them
8079200	8081200	With proper burial services
8081200	8083200	Doesn't it strike you as funny
8083200	8085200	That so many wanderers die in harvest?
8085200	8087200	No
8087200	8089200	Strikes me as sad
8089200	8091200	You have an odd sense of humor Steve
8091200	8093200	Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted
8093200	8095200	He's dead
8095200	8097200	It looks like some thief wanted
8097200	8099200	His barber's pole but didn't think of the consequences
8099200	8101200	Yeah
8101200	8103200	That's what the guy had to do
8103200	8105200	Maybe whoever it was really needed
8105200	8107200	That barber's pole bad
8107200	8109200	There's no excuse for hurting someone else
8109200	8111200	Even if Pastorelli were alive
8111200	8113200	Now his heart would be broken
8113200	8115200	And what's a little profit compared to that?
8117200	8119200	The most normal
8119200	8121200	These are the
8121200	8123200	These characters
8123200	8125200	Are the sense of
8125200	8127200	Is the moral reasoning
8127200	8129200	And I have to burn down
8129200	8131200	Their
8131200	8133200	Their precious home
8133200	8135200	I mean like this was her
8135200	8137200	Her memento from her
8137200	8139200	From the husband that went away
8147200	8149200	Ugh
8149200	8151200	I feel bad
8151200	8153200	But I'm not gonna stop
8155200	8157200	I'm not gonna stop
8157200	8159200	Ugh
8163200	8165200	I feel bad
8165200	8167200	I feel like really bad
8167200	8169200	But I'm not gonna stop
8169200	8171200	Ugh
8179200	8181200	Okay
8181200	8183200	Hello?
8183200	8185200	Yes
8185200	8187200	I did it
8193200	8195200	Got him! Yeah!
8195200	8197200	We did it!
8199200	8201200	Woohoo!
8201200	8203200	You're busted!
8207200	8209200	What will people think?
8211200	8213200	Yeah
8215200	8217200	He's a smiley bear
8217200	8219200	But we should give him a token of our
8219200	8221200	Appreciation for his silence
8221200	8223200	Here Stephen, take this baseball bat
8223200	8225200	You'll find it quite useful
8227200	8229200	Alright
8229200	8231200	Maybe I could use a good solid bat
8231200	8233200	Yeah boy
8233200	8235200	Take the bat
8235200	8237200	And we'll take the photo
8237200	8239200	However will I keep the children in line now
8239200	8241200	I have a spare I can bring in tomorrow
8241200	8243200	Unless you prefer a chainsaw this time
8243200	8245200	I'll talk to Mrs. Phelps
8247200	8249200	Can I do it again?
8251200	8253200	Okay
8253200	8255200	Well that didn't work
8257200	8259200	A chainsaw?
8259200	8261200	Oh strongy!
8263200	8265200	I feel so terrible
8265200	8267200	That's okay
8267200	8269200	Start using the bat
8269200	8271200	On what?

8329200	8331200	Game crimes
8331200	8333200	We are currently playing
8333200	8335200	Harvester
8335200	8337200	It's a game from
8337200	8339200	Senpai

8341200	8343200	Anyways

8357200	8359200	Controversial game

8847200	8849200	Edna's diner
8849200	8851200	And she's like the voice of reason in this game
8861200	8863200	Hi Mr. Bake Sale
8863200	8865200	Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted
8865200	8867200	He's dead
8867200	8869200	It looks like some thief wanted his
8869200	8871200	Barbers pole but didn't think of the consequences
8871200	8873200	Could you hit the lodge guy with the bat?
8873200	8875200	Maybe whoever it was really needed that
8875200	8877200	Barbers pole bat
8877200	8879200	That's no excuse for hurting someone else
8879200	8881200	Even if Pastorelli were alive now
8881200	8883200	His heart would be broken
8883200	8885200	We'll consider that
8885200	8887200	We'll consider that
8887200	8889200	Hi
8889200	8891200	We'll consider that
8893200	8895200	Or the sheriff
8895200	8897200	We'll consider those possibilities
8897200	8899200	Soon
8899200	8901200	Now
8901200	8903200	We can go spy on them

8959200	8961200	I think the photo is worth more than that
8961200	8963200	Should we do that? Should we do like
8963200	8965200	There's more than that
8965200	8967200	Let's just see
8973200	8975200	I'll take the fricking bat
8981200	8983200	Whatever I'll take the bat
8983200	8985200	See ya
8985200	8987200	It's so true though
8987200	8989200	It's so true they're educators
8989200	8991200	They got no money
8991200	8993200	She's gonna bat you
8993200	8995200	I mean like
8995200	8997200	Apparently she already did

9023200	9025200	Yeah
9031200	9033200	I'm gonna visit the barber shop
9033200	9035200	And cry a little
9041200	9043200	Oh no
9045200	9047200	That for the occasion I
9051200	9054200	Think about taking some of that sighting off my hand son
9054200	9056200	It's sad to see
9056200	9058200	To see that you know it's just a chart
9071200	9073200	The beef was well done too
9075200	9078200	Problem is both was burnt so bad
9078200	9080200	And the flesh all crisp
9080200	9082200	And distorted limbs melded
9082200	9084200	You couldn't tell them apart
9086200	9088200	And well I didn't want to take a chance
9088200	9090200	On eating Italian
9090200	9092200	No sir I didn't
9092200	9094200	You didn't want it? You were gonna eat him?
9094200	9096200	Nice to see you again Steve

9103200	9105200	That dang edged pastorelli
9105200	9107200	Went out and got his self-electric cheated
9107200	9110200	Somebody stole the barber's pole
9110200	9112200	The alarm system triggered the sprinkler
9112200	9115200	There was water on the floor this morning
9115200	9118200	And the derm crook left exposed wires out
9118200	9120200	The pastorelli came in
9120200	9122200	Flipped the switch and then
9122200	9124200	ZAP
9124200	9127200	Maybe them aliens is hot for colored glass after all
9128200	9131200	Any time Steve
9131200	9133200	Not gonna lie
9133200	9135200	I'm a little sad
9135200	9137200	I'm a little sad
9138200	9140200	Pastorelli
9140200	9142200	He didn't talk much
9142200	9144200	But he was there
9145200	9148200	Okay now I gotta figure out how to burn that damn building now
9148200	9150200	Sorry son

9182200	9184200	Don't forget this
9185200	9187200	I don't think I told anyone about you by the way
9189200	9192200	That was some whiplash for sure
9194200	9196200	Mood switch crazy

9220200	9222200	Nobody's buying my cookies
9222200	9226200	They're all saving up for the big bake sale
9226200	9229200	Somebody stole the barber's pole from that nice Italian
9229200	9231200	Italian
9231200	9233200	Can you imagine?
9233200	9237200	And then they left wife wires dangling in a puddle
9237200	9240200	Which Pastorelli immediately stepped in and fried
9240200	9242200	The stupid dago
9242200	9245200	Heavens to Betsy when it rains it pours

10751860	10759460	plunge hmm you may be right I'm a mortician not a medical examiner you don't have to be to know
10759460	10764340	that being ripped to shreds can be detrimental to your health this is not something you want to
10764340	10770100	be looking into young man

10779140	10783540	am get the hell out of here or is that a threat I've got the goods on you not vice versa
10788340	10796900	number one number one no shit that's what we all want what do you mean that's a game we win or
10796900	10801220	lose together wait what are you gonna tell me what I want to know or do I go to the sheriff
10801220	10807780	with these pictures that would be a grave mistake I assure you I've told you all I can
10808740	10812260	my losses have been substantial of late so I can't offer you money
10813700	10820660	the only thing I can give you an exchange for the photographs is my tube of astro glue I do
10820660	10831780	suggest you take it for it's all you'll get from me here we go should we just take the glue now
10832020	10841780	yeah we're just oh it's a trade or should I say not good enough I'm going to the sheriff
10842580	10843460	I'll probably die
10846020	10854980	fuck it I want to see be sure and tell actually I want the young man it seems like that corpse in
10854980	10861940	the chapel I'll dress up and nowhere to go god knows by putting these people up at the wayward
10861940	10869380	hotel I do orps the corpse reclining in the chapel right now is a prime example of the difficulties
10869380	10875460	I've just like oh that's where the hint came from he died a purely natural car but why come to harvest
10875460	10882260	to die I've often puzzled this was this was the hint oops though I can assure you young man that
10882260	10888340	nothing untoward is happening in harvest on the contrary it's an indication of our compassion
10888340	10894100	that I put up hobos in the wayward hotel and the order of the harvest moon mandates their prompt
10894100	10900660	burial even when they are without family or means and when it entails losses on my part
10901780	10906980	bye okay that was the hint say it's been a that was a hint he why didn't you tell me that before
10906980	10913540	anyways give me this again ah you that john hmm you don't this is
10915540	10923060	that's what we would get a look that would be I do suggest okay I'll take the glue wise decision
10924020	10931380	when a wasp's nest is stirred up it is seldom the wasps who grieve later thanks for the glue get
10931380	10938420	out of here I got a little things at our order but we got there we got the glue
10943540	10952020	now what do I do with the glue I wanted it so badly I wanted it so badly but now I'm just like well
10952020	10959060	what do I do with it wasp like the wasp lady yeah

13084980	13091460	hello dear how are you today the nerve of some people burning down the tv station to detract from
13091460	13098660	our bake sale I doubt the perpetrator did it just to annoy the harvest pta coincidence I don't think
13098660	13103860	so just six months ago the newspaper building went up in smoke obviously there's a fire bug on the
13104340	13109380	either that or a communist communist huh I'm so scared
13112500	13116980	why are you so why are you scared now that the bake sales over I just don't know how I'll
13116980	13125780	fill my time oh I feel so useless what's wrong with her

13162020	13168420	feeling useless just because there are no more cookies to bake I can still rear my brood this is
13168420	13176580	a sign Steve I have a purpose again glad to see you're feeling better mine that fire still burns
13176660	13184820	my bridges first the newspaper building then DNA's diner then WHAR I sense a pattern and any
13184820	13190260	pattern I can't make a dress out of is no darn good I suppose you heard about DNA's diner burning
13190260	13196420	down sheriff Dwayne thinks it was a grease fire we took a black eye on the bake sale but I'm sure
13196420	13202580	the harvest pta annual blood drive will be more successful overall we made about 200 dollars
13202580	13208020	hardly enough to bury a dead horse and definitely not enough to cover the annual blood drive
13211700	13212500	the blood drive
13215060	13223380	oh is my sister okay annual blood drive huh if you knew how much blood we get you'd be more impressed
13224420	13230420	donations are mandatory Steve if you're still here come sunday you'll be expected to give
13230900	13238100	until it hurts I suppose until it hurts even Hank will have to donate of course lodge members
13238100	13246100	are exempt remember that hey either way no one's sticking me with the needle we don't use needles

13346980	13351700	I can't believe anyone would burn down the tv station the night of the bake sale
13352420	13358020	I just hope nothing will stop the harvest blood drive and I don't think that anything can
13359220	13366340	I'm not one to gossip but I'm sure you've heard that DNA's diner burned down but did you know
13366340	13373380	she killed herself when she found out what her and her daughter too what I hear the sheriff suspects
13373380	13380180	the fire was set if you ask me whoever burned down the diner is a murderer just the same as

14271860	14275860	was always a struggle to keep it running in such a small town
14277380	14284420	and now we've lost it I know that I can't afford to support this now there's only one way out
14285460	14292340	I'm sure you won't be able to understand the depth of despair that would enable mother to
14292420	14298900	put a rope around a baby's neck and push him into the air and jump after her
14300660	14307700	and when your father makes me know if she kicks around and takes a long time to strangle
14309060	14316100	else for you I won't cut her down I've got to be stronger than I ever was before
14316100	14319860	but I hope she doesn't get it
14321940	14324260	God help us and forgive us

14596420	14602900	extra insurance right away I have no desire to wind up dangling from my rafters like Edna
14602900	14609940	believe you me Steve did you see the fire as I was watching the tv station go up
14610660	14617620	I was reminded of the old Sentinel building when you think about it you know two communication
14617620	14622340	complexes going up in smoke you have to wonder if it was a coincidence
14626580	14629540	hello Steve well I bought everything from her
14632020	14634180	yeah well she bought extra insurance
14634900	14642500	I guess we can check what happens with

14670820	14679540	DNA's diner burned down what a shame women running things that's the problem if she'd
14679540	14688820	had a man around that fire never would have happened what a waste damn terrible thing that business
14688820	14695380	with the tv station I can't sleep now we hate some waking up in a cold sweat
14696820	14702980	I'm thinking of getting some fireproof aluminum siding for my garage we hate some that's a good
14702980	14703940	I hate some
14707540	14713140	uh we'll probably get killed if we spread smash his car but goodness that I smash it
14714100	14721140	hmm I don't like that I don't like it no Sherry that woman was the voice of reason
14728660	14730100	that one was the voice of reason
14735940	14739380	nah and now it's a real one young man we real
14740180	14744820	the WHAR fire is just another example of the vagaries of my profession
14746340	14753940	odd after such a catastrophic conflagration not to have any fatalities disappointing in a way

15345300	15349700	I can't fucking read that be it known that the sacred order of the
15349700	15356340	practically confession confession to watch son murder isn't that what you're here to investigate

15407300	15414020	it's just not sanitary I see I don't suppose it'd hurt for you to take the card
15414740	15416420	seeing as it was addressed to you
15417540	15418580	the shucks
15418580	15420420	senpai senpai

15533220	15535140	I'll go back to my house to look at the note
15537940	15539300	where is the note there it is
15541220	15549220	be it known that the sacred order of the harvest moon hereby extends notice of the eligibility
15549220	15555540	of Steve Mason her niche initiation into the sacred mysteries of the harvest let me
15555540	15560180	presented with all the possible haste to sergeant and arms for
15562660	15564820	for commencement of the rites
15567780	15570100	okay I wish my rash would leave me alone too
15574260	15575300	if we have to meet him now
15580020	15580980	what do you want from me
15580980	15588020	you received the invitation but you have not brought it
15590180	15596340	what do you mean brought what I don't understand the invitation was not the card
15597060	15603140	but the spinal cord it must be presented to me I have to get the spinal cord
15603220	15604500	you to enter
15609700	15613060	you expect me to steal their mains and bring them here you stick bastard

15645780	15646740	looks like I go back
15654580	15658340	if this is this a metaphor to grow a spine probably
15660420	15662820	well I already grave robbed so we're fine
15663380	15667460	here we go
15669860	15676340	back at it again we already did this I did this way earlier that's so funny
15677700	15680740	that's so funny that I already did this I did things out of order
15680900	15688900	okay get over here
15692180	15695780	it says reference to sub zero's fatality oh yeah that makes sense
15697300	15699060	here you go you stinking bitch
15699620	15708260	ah you have done well now let the initiation commence as your mystic
15708980	15709620	mystic ag
15709620	15720420	requested and required that I turn over this sacred dagger to you to aid you in your quest

15727460	15735940	you must now enter the lodge initiates find it our style place are you supposed to help me
15735940	15745860	or get me killed I'm starting you on the path of initiation to a very special very exclusive
15745860	15755300	brotherhood I am merely the administrator of a test whether you view me as an enemy
15755300	15764420	or a friend depends on how well you're prepared to pass this thing you haven't said what it is
15765060	15771380	it is a special weapon using it will be part of the initiation
15771380	15780260	the hell with your initiation
15783540	15794020	okay whatever occurs in here is relevant to the great question which you cannot help but answer
15794740	15803860	what is at issue is whether in answering the question you will find the answers you seek
15804660	15811460	you will encounter those intent on preventing or prompting your answer depending on how you
15811460	15822900	look at it while the assumption is you want to live dying is easy and provides its own answer
15822900	15830580	but not for you just tell me is Stephanie dead or being held within the membership director
15830580	15838100	on the second level keeps track of such wow you just talked a lot then you are against me
15838900	15847060	I am the sergeant at arms I am here to ensure that the protocols are observed
15847700	15855060	deviation from a protocol shall result in punishment remember what I have told you

18328500	18337500	I'll take this as a sign to stop right now.
18337500	18346500	I think this is the sign.
18346500	18354500	It's going to just catten.
18354500	18362500	Wow, Senpai! It looks like we're going to have to return to this game another day.
18362500	18374500	I'm pretty sure we're very close to the end, so it'll probably be the game and then probably another game if I finish earlier.
18374500	18382500	But oh man, did it crash!
18382500	18387500	It's okay, I'm so happy to have all my Senpais here with me.

18412500	18418500	And then I'll post my upcoming schedule around Sunday, probably.
18418500	18421500	Yes, most likely.
18421500	18427500	So I hope, oh man, I feel bad that we haven't finished the game, but hey, it crashed!
18427500	18430500	What else are we going to do?
18430500	18434500	Thank you for the 420 almighty hair on!
18435500	18444500	When a lovely Senpai you are.
18444500	18462500	I'm excited for karaoke, but I'm also a little nervous, so I hope Senpai doesn't mind if I'm not the greatest singer, but I'm trying!
18462500	18465500	And that's the idol way, right?
18465500	18472500	I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your, your arrow idol.
18472500	18476500	In training! Well, maybe I am already an idol.
18476500	18485500	Oh well.
18486500	18489500	It's the hardest I count, so I'm going to try my best.
18489500	18492500	I'll try my best for Senpai.
18492500	18499500	What exactly is an arrow idol?
18499500	18510500	Well, if you take away the A, what does it say?
18515500	18528500	Senpai, figure it out!
18528500	18531500	Good job Senpai, I'm proud of you!
18531500	18535500	Remember, use your brains, and your eyes.
18535500	18541500	Your eyes and your brain.
18541500	18543500	It's okay Senpai.
18543500	18547500	We got, we have to, we have to be a little sneaky here.
18547500	18552500	We have to be a little sneaky here.
18552500	18556500	It's okay, I forgive you.
18556500	18559500	That's asking a lot, Kohai. No it's not!
18559500	18565500	Heck, I'll even, I'll even put in some books into the cages so you'll read.
18565500	18572500	Like a Moby Dick, or a Skylight Letter, or a Picture of Dorian Gray.
18572500	18577500	You can have a lot of books to read and then your mind will open.
18577500	18587500	Or I'll open your mind myself using an axe.
18587500	18592500	Can we get some Hamlets? Sure.
18592500	18595500	How about the Mysterious Island?
18595500	18600500	I've got, what book do I have?
18600500	18605500	Hold on, Senpai, I have a book about an island just for you.
18605500	18609500	The Island of Dr. Moro. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
18609500	18613500	The Island of Dr. Moro. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
18613500	18631500	Yeah, where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? Where's Waddle? It's too easy.
18631500	18634500	Can we read Cardcaptor Sakura instead?
18634500	18637500	Did you even watch Cardcaptor Sakura?
18637500	18642500	Speaking of, speaking of Senpai.
18642500	18656500	Did you do your homework yet?
18656500	18661500	We still have time. Of course you have time.
18661500	18667500	I just wanted to make sure earlier you start the Moro free time you have.
18667500	18670500	This class has homework?
18670500	18675500	Yep. I can explain. Yeah, about that.
18675500	18680500	Well, I'm going to expect my thousand word essay. It's very, I'm being very lenient.
18680500	18687500	And your thousand word essay do by, I think I said, I said in three weeks, right?
18687500	18694500	So that means this is week one. No, this would be week two.
18694500	18703500	You have one more week.
18703500	18709500	Wait, what's the essay on? Cardcaptor Sakura?
18709500	18715500	Cardcaptor Sakura. Everyone needs to watch.
18715500	18719500	Everyone needs to watch Cardcaptor Sakura in the two movies.
18719500	18721500	Where do we post it?
18721500	18727500	I'll post it on my Twitter and then everyone can reply underneath.
18727500	18736500	Does it matter how it's written? I'll take MLA citation.
18736500	18748500	What about clear card? Clear card is unnecessary. That's only bonus material.
18748500	18755500	That's bonus material. You don't have to do that. It's only if you really want to.
18755500	18759500	I'll take MLA citation or APA.
18759500	18765500	Make sure to alphabetize it.
18765500	18769500	Google docs. Not Google.
18769500	18775500	Not Google. You have to send it in.
18775500	18779500	Actually, better yet. Marles. I'll give you a grade.
18779500	18795500	If you send it through Marles, I'll give you a grade on it.
18795500	18812500	What's our reward? You want some motivation?
18812500	18817500	What's more motivating than a job well done?
18817500	18825500	In a little phrase. Heck, I'll tell you I'm proud of you.
18825500	18831500	Does Marle have a max word count? I think it's a thousand, which is what I'm saying.
18831500	18842500	I'll make it 500. 500 word. How about that? 500 word essay.
18842500	18850500	The card after your localization is okay. Yeah, localization is okay too.
18850500	18867500	I think Marle is exactly a thousand. I was going to say a thousand characters. It'll be fine.
18867500	18881500	You have to write about how much you liked it and how great Sakura is and what you think about the series.
18881500	18885500	I want you to learn from it. There you go. I mean so nice.
18885500	18890500	I would just torture everyone and be like, you have to watch it in these days and if you don't.
18890500	18907500	Well, I guess there's a free vacancy in the cage.
18907500	18913500	Honestly. Honestly, I just think it's just fun.
18913500	18921500	I think it'll be fun if I can talk to my senpai about something that I really love.
18921500	18934500	I actually really like the Novana one. Novana? Is that the company? I like the Novana dub. That's the one I grew up with.
18934500	18948500	So I want something in common with senpai and what's better way to connect our hearts than through anime.
18948500	18959500	Can I write about how much I love Mercy? You can do that as bonus work.
18959500	18971500	I think it'll be fun though. I think all of us watching something together would be really fun.
18971500	18977500	And so I can gap about it and everyone will be like, oh okay, I get it. I understand.
18977500	18984500	The one from the early 2000s? Yes, that one.
18984500	18997500	Do we have to do our sources? No, but it's just fun to mess with you.
18997500	19002500	I'm not going to do a watch along on YouTube simply because, wow.
19002500	19009500	I'm getting in trouble. I'm getting bonked. I'm getting a little spanky.
19009500	19016500	I get a little spanky. So I don't want to do that. I don't want to get in trouble.
19016500	19036500	I worked really hard. I worked really hard senpai to not get bonked by YouTube.
19036500	19045500	So I worked really hard. I've even been like, I hope I don't get in trouble for uncensoring now.
19045500	19051500	But now that I've got monetization, then they can take it away at any point.
19051500	19060500	Thank you, boy, for your $1 tip. Congrats on 5,140 subscribers.
19060500	19067500	We can celebrate karaoke, right? Do I have 5K already? Thank you.
19067500	19074500	Thank you, everyone, for your support then. I really appreciate that.
19074500	19080500	My next big goal will be 10K. What do you think?
19081500	19089500	Had you been censored on your model this whole time? Oh, yep.
19089500	19096500	Will you be able to do song requests on your street on Sunday?
19096500	19105500	I don't think so, mostly because I practice these songs.
19105500	19109500	10K sounds easy. I don't know. That sounds kind of hard.
19109500	19118500	Do you have a favorite Sakura outfit? I love the cat outfit and I love the prince outfit as well.
19118500	19128500	I think those are really cute.
19128500	19132500	You could do 10K without even trying? Really?
19132500	19138500	I don't know. That seems really hard.
19138500	19145500	I mean, I would be super happy if we reached 10K, but do you need to watch the movies too?
19145500	19159500	Yes, of course. That's how the series ends. It's within the movies. That's how it ends.
19159500	19165500	It's really nice. Also, the first movie is really nice and the second movie is really nice too. I think they're really good.
19165500	19169500	It's possible. Let's hope.
19169500	19178500	My biggest goal is going to be 100K, so Mama Mercy can be like,
19178500	19187500	Oh, look, you got a play button. That's nice.
19187500	19201500	But you remember us when you get famous? Of course. I always remember all my supplies.
19201500	19208500	Is there a manga too or does anime and movies cover it all? The anime and movie pretty much cover it all.
19208500	19218500	Actually, the anime has more stuff than the manga.
19218500	19226500	Will you name the button after your parents if you can put anything on it? I think I'll just put myself on it.
19226500	19235500	I'll get a bigger cage if we get 100K. I'll get a bigger cage for everyone.
19235500	19253500	I think if I can order more than one, I think I'd like to give the allure one, strong one, and then get my own.
19253500	19263500	I think I'll keep it as my channel title as a memento of it.
19263500	19273500	You can order more, but it does cost. I'm willing to pay for the cost of it.
19273500	19280500	I'm willing to pay for the cost of it.
19280500	19286500	Or getting one to me as well.
19286500	19295500	I really want one. Mama's been trying to give me suggestions on how to get to 100K really fast and she was like,
19295500	19317500	Sweetie, you should do a film tour of the Costco. People are always interested in watching Costco.
19317500	19325500	Yeah, Costco's vlog.
19325500	19337500	I don't think I can show a tour of the local Costco because I think that would dox me hard.
19337500	19349500	But I admit, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of people who are very interested in Costco.
19349500	19357500	Costco dream date. Cost effective and free samples.
19357500	19364500	Show off the Costco rotisserie chicken. Yeah, actually those are pretty good.
19364500	19369500	I've never seen one, so I just did. You can pass the laptops.
19369500	19378500	ASMRRP concept virtual Costco tour.
19378500	19389500	I think my favorite, you stalk images and pretend I'm taking you through Costco.
19389500	19397500	Oh, that'll be so funny. Okay, I'll see when I can do some pie.
19397500	19413500	Imagine if Costco sponsors us. That's not going to happen. We're definitely not family friendly.
19413500	19422500	Are there VR chat? I don't think I have a model for or I don't even have like a regular model.
19422500	19426500	Costco's family friendly?
19426500	19434500	Well, yeah.
19434500	19439500	I think so. Yeah.
19439500	19444500	Anyways.
19444500	19449500	Oh, I'm getting a little, little, I'm getting the little eye burns.
19449500	19453500	So I'm going to guess that I'm getting really, really tired.
19453500	19456500	He's a placeholder model.
19456500	19465500	I'm getting really tired. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow being my day off and then I can hang out with some friends if I wanted to or just rest the entire day.
19465500	19467500	Who knows?
19467500	19475500	Mercy, your mouth is the most expressive I've ever seen. Excuse me.
19475500	19480500	I think it's because I'm an expressive person.
19480500	19496500	I think it's because I'm an expressive person. Otherwise, otherwise, I think it would be pretty much the same as any of my other gen mites.
19497500	19502500	But yeah, I'll take a good slaps.
19502500	19519500	But yeah, I look forward to seeing my supplies on Sunday. I may need breaks if, for example, you know, once again, my arm decides to flare up and be, be, be bad.
19519500	19524500	So yeah, I hope everyone has a good one. Okay.
19524500	19528500	And I'll see you again next time.
19528500	19532500	Speaking for Mercy! Bye!
19554500	19559500	Thanks for watching!
