1
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh

2
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey

3
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ah, good enough for those supplies

4
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Can you hear me okay? How's the volume?

5
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I hope everything's okay

6
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm gonna pamper you

7
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Turn up the volume then

8
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Turn up the volume then

9
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Today, I'm gonna pamper you

10
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because you did such a good job

11
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's been a long day

12
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I felt like it's a nice day

13
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So, don't you want to kiss me again?

14
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Shhh, I'm scared

15
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay

16
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How about I whisper a little loud?

17
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is that better?

18
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay

19
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay

20
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How about I whisper a little louder?

21
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Is that better?

22
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Is that better?

23
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay

24
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's much better, okay

25
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm so sorry

26
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Today, I'm going to pamper my supplies

27
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I went out and got so many things for my supplies

28
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I hope you like them

29
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Can you hear this?

30
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Can you hear this?

31
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
These are the papples that you guys were talking about

32
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
These are the papples I cried

33
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The crack pipes, they're not really crack pipes

34
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They're ice rollers

35
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They're ice rollers

36
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They're ice rollers

37
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's not blood

38
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh my goodness

39
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Can't give you a second if it's still too quiet

40
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know how I can whisper even louder

41
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay, hold on

42
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I got this, okay, audio keeps cutting out

43
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay, give me a second

44
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm so sorry, I'm so new to this

45
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay

46
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Is this better?

47
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I turned it off

48
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I turned it off

49
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I turned it off

50
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I turned it off

51
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now, now, everything, can you hear everything?

52
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay, so bye

53
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm going to use the ice rollers on you and massage your face

54
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I hope it feels good

55
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Can you feel it on your eyes?

56
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
These ice rollers are great for public eyes

57
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Your eyes, yes, sometimes it's really this small

58
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And so, if you put these in the fridge, it has to pop in

59
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And if you want more of it, good

60
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It just relaxes with the supply

61
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It covers

62
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm just going to treat you

63
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay

64
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going

65
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay

66
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
These ones might make a little bit of a different sound

67
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Because the bubbles, the head is actually shaped like moles

68
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So the moons might make a little bit of a different sound

69
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That would be a mistake

70
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you for the rate, middle

71
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Middle

72
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm glad you like it so far

73
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm glad you like it so far

74
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Edithal, welcome, welcome to the stream

75
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Doing ASMR is my first time ever

76
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Trying ASMR

77
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay

78
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Left eye massage

79
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Right eye one

80
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Doing this on

81
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know which to use

82
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Anyway, I'm going to try the left eye massage

83
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Left eye massage

84
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Head on

85
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I have a one day ASMR special spot

86
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And put this on my lap

87
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Bring it back up

88
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I want something simple

89
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's brand new, let's open it

90
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Almost got it on your ear there

91
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's a box cutter, let's open this package now

92
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's open this package

93
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Let's open it

94
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Let's open it

95
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's open it

96
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Shhh, and toss this in trash now

97
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I bought you a gel

98
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
A gel mask for you to wear

99
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The back is nice and plush

100
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
A lot of gel balls are rolling around

101
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm going to angle this because you're laying on my lap so far

102
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm not going to lie, this feels really good to squish as well

103
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Alright, let's put this around except my

104
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh dear, I need some scissors

105
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's cut the tag off

106
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
There we go

107
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Sorry that made a big sound

108
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Alright

109
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
No eye patch today

110
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Today the eye patch stays on so I can look at your eyes and look into my eyes

111
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay, I'm putting it on now so far

112
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Let me adjust it for you

113
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Does it feel comfortable Senpai?

114
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Do you feel like it's relaxing your eyes?

115
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll massage on top of it

116
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Okay

117
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You must be so tired

118
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay

119
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Can I scratch your face?

120
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's like Senpai

121
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's like Senpai

122
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Good

123
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Good, I'm so glad you're so glad

124
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I love you Senpai

125
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There we go

126
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
One kiss, we don't want to get in trouble

127
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Let's have a ear massage

128
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I had a ear massage once, it was really nice

129
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm just gonna copy them, I hope

130
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I hope that Senpai feels good too

131
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
A little ear massages

132
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm gonna go a little bit deeper

133
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Okay, I'm gonna go a little deeper

134
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm trying to be as gentle as I can

135
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm trying to be as gentle as I can

136
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Okay

137
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Nice and relaxed

138
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I love you Senpai

139
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Let's massage the top of your ear and your ear

140
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Okay

141
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Wow, hey, yeah, it did so well this week Senpai

142
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It did so well this week

143
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm so proud

144
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm so proud

145
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We're doing so well, we're doing so well

146
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And

147
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Oh, Senpai

148
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay, you got hair on your face

149
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay, don't worry, I got it

150
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Doesn't hurt each other

151
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Piyoto intimate

152
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
If you also love it, it doesn't hurt to shine

153
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay

154
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You want me to call a good girl?

155
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay

156
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Good girl

157
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You've been so very good

158
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The week, we're halfway through the week

159
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So you can relax

160
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You can relax and have a lot of fun on the weekend

161
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You've been so good

162
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Good girl

163
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Hold on Senpai, let me take this mask off

164
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Good boy

165
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You did so good this week

166
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You're halfway through the week

167
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And you have such a fun weekend

168
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm sorry I was quiet before

169
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's just that

170
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't know how close I can get to you Senpai

171
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm a little shy

172
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So getting too close

173
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Makes me a little nervous

174
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This is close enough

175
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Does it feel good?

176
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Scream into your ear, no thank you

177
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Some of my Senpais

178
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Might not like that

179
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Senpai

180
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Are you feeling relaxed now?

181
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay

182
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm so glad that

183
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Let's bring these back

184
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Let's bring these back

185
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
These

186
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
They were sitting in my lap

187
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So they're a little warm

188
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Just like you

189
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
These waterfalls are a little bit different

190
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
They're shaped like moons

191
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So they kind of remind me of Sailor Moon Wands

192
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Presum, power

193
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Makeup

194
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If you scratch my forehead

195
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Kill this one

196
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Okay

197
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Kill this one

198
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Okay

199
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Kill this one

200
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay

201
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Is that better?

202
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Is that better?

203
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
No, it's not a magical girl, R.P.

204
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I just think they look like Sailor Moon Wands

205
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I know what you're really like

206
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
In the name of the moon

207
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'll punish you

208
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Okay

209
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm sorry, I'm trying to

210
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
To suppress my laugh

211
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:29,800
Oh no, I don't want to be loud, I know some of you, I know some of you are trying to

212
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
huh?

213
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,800
These actually really sound nice, these sound so nice, right?

214
00:31:44,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Signers, he found it in stores, I thought of him for a few seconds

215
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
huh?

216
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Do you want the scissors back?

217
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
What kind of scissors?

218
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:42,800
This, it's a gel mask, it's a gel mask with little gel balls in it, it's got a plush back

219
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
ok

220
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
oops, almost cut your ear off

221
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
ok

222
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
hahaha

223
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
what about right in front of me?

224
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:40,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I got a little excited

225
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I got a little excited, I'm sorry

226
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I'm sorry

227
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm sorry

228
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
here

229
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
that's it

230
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
here

231
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
here, let's put it back

232
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,800
that's not bad

233
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
wow, I can wipe it off

234
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
there you go

235
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
there you go

236
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,800
I'm going to tap on your highlight

237
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,800
sorry, I don't have any bandages on me right now

238
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
sorry

239
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
you always look perfect so far

240
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
always

241
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
kiss me

242
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
ok

243
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:22,800
your ears are just fine, your ears are just fine

244
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
your face is still beautiful

245
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,800
you are doing great

246
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,800
sorry, I got a little rough

247
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,800
I guess some instincts took over

248
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,800
it's not just anything you did, it's me

249
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I don't think it's going to work, I don't want you to do that

250
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
ok

251
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
here, take some ear massages

252
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
I don't think it will work

253
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,800
I love you so much

254
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
I love you so much so much

255
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
you did so well

256
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm sorry

257
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
I hate you

258
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
not this time

259
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I love you

260
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
I love you

261
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
I love you

262
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
you're so good

263
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
good girl

264
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800
you've been such a good girl

265
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,800
you've been such a good boy

266
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
bye

267
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
toki toki

268
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
toki toki

269
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
that's how

270
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
my heart beats for you

271
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
good

272
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
meow meow

273
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
good

274
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
meow meow

275
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
now

276
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
now

277
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
now

278
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
now

279
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
now

280
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
now

281
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,800
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

282
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
wait

283
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
wait

284
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,800
ok, now try just reuse it by

285
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,800
toasted coconuts

286
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
toasted coconuts

287
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Cabbage, cabbages, cabbages, like this is, like this is, like this is.

288
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:18,800
6, 6, card.

289
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:27,800
Stop it, stop it, bye.

290
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Where is my super scent?

291
00:44:48,800 --> 00:45:13,800
I said why is my super scent?

292
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:38,800
Papi, Papi.

293
00:45:38,800 --> 00:46:03,800
Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound?

294
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:17,800
Ten amour, ten amour.

295
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:46,800
Give yourself a good example, you're so pretty.

296
00:46:46,800 --> 00:47:15,800
Give yourself a good example.

297
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Give yourself a good example.

298
00:47:39,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound?

299
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:28,800
Can I make that blue song?

300
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Do you want to hear the sound?

301
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Do you like it past, like this?

302
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:43,800
Okay, I can keep doing this, right?

303
00:49:43,800 --> 00:50:08,800
As long as you're feeling relaxed and fine, that's all that matters. Water, give me a moment, I'll be extra gentle with you.

304
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Water, give me a moment.

305
00:50:35,800 --> 00:51:02,800
Water, give me a moment, I'll be extra gentle with you.

306
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Water, give me a moment.

307
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:56,800
Water, give me a moment, I'll be extra gentle with you.

308
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:27,800
Water, give me a moment.

309
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Water, give me a moment.

310
00:52:40,800 --> 00:53:05,800
Water, give me a moment.

311
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Water, give me a moment.

312
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Water, give me a moment.

313
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Water, give me a moment.

314
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:34,800
Water, give me a moment.

315
00:54:34,800 --> 00:55:01,800
Water, give me a moment.

316
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:22,800
Water, give me a moment.

317
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:48,800
Water, give me a moment.

318
00:55:48,800 --> 00:56:03,800
Water, give me a moment.

319
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:30,800
Water, give me a moment.

320
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Water, give me a moment.

321
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:17,800
Water, give me a moment.

322
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:46,800
Water, give me a moment.

323
00:57:47,800 --> 00:58:13,800
Water, give me a moment.

324
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:42,800
Water, give me a moment.

325
00:58:43,800 --> 00:59:02,800
Water, give me a moment.

326
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:22,800
Water, give me a moment.

327
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:42,800
Water, give me a moment.

328
00:59:42,800 --> 01:00:09,800
Water, give me a moment.

329
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:29,800
Water, give me a moment.

330
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:49,800
Water, give me a moment.

331
01:00:49,800 --> 01:01:09,800
Water, give me a moment.

332
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:29,800
Water, give me a moment.

333
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:46,800
I'm trying to be as tame as possible so that my supplies go to sleep and wake up, maybe able to see my sleep.

334
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:54,800
I'm tapping on you.

335
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:14,800
I hope that's correct or not.

336
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:33,800
I'm a little stuffed up so it will sound disgusting if I...it will sound disgusting.

337
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:51,800
My favorite deep end, um, when that's on sale.

338
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:57,800
Can I burp the outfit? No, I can't burp a little on command. I can't burp on command.

339
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:18,800
The image turned out to be my little poncho.

340
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:28,800
My good little pets.

341
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,800
My good little pets.

342
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:42,800
YouTube doesn't punish me. I wonder if YouTube, I wonder if YouTube is different in each region, depending on their DOS.

343
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:52,800
Because I know a lot of JPAs are a little bit more on the sexy side, but they don't get attacked.

344
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:29,800
I can't stream before using a VPN because it's faster. It's not fast. It will let you go crazy.

345
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:44,800
OBS doesn't recognize different regions and will not let you stream if you use a VPN. It's very hard to deal with.

346
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:50,800
So, I have to abide by the rules.

347
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:59,800
Okay. You can be good, right, Senpai, and follow the rules with me.

348
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:05,800
Right, you can follow the rules, right? My heartbeat.

349
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:18,800
I'm not going to lie, Senpai. You're kind of heavy, so I can't put you on my chest.

350
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:46,800
Sorry, Senpai.

351
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Well, please, you. The microphone is kind of heavy, didn't it?

352
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,800
The 3DL, the stand I put it on, a little bit.

353
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,800
Better.

354
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,800
Okay.

355
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:43,800
When I get a new stand to Senpai, I'll put you on my chest and then give you my heartbeat. Okay?

356
01:06:43,800 --> 01:07:00,800
Are smaller than you can hear my heartbeat. Right now, it's a little heavy.

357
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:08,800
If I lift this up, I can lift it up a little bit, but it's quite heavy.

358
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:19,800
I can probably use this to break your head in, Senpai. It can probably smash a few skulls in.

359
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:28,800
I'll try my best, Senpai, but I can't make any problems.

360
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:39,800
Okay, it takes a little while for you to smell.

361
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:51,800
I don't have it on me, so I might take a while.

362
01:07:51,800 --> 01:08:10,800
I don't want to spook you with my keyboard, and...

363
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:21,800
Yeah, I don't want to spook you with my keyboard, and my keyboard and mouse, they're kind of loud.

364
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,800
Oh, yeah.

365
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:31,800
Senpai, here's that one.

366
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,800
Okay.

367
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,800
Although I might become numb.

368
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:07,800
Bad boy, bad girl.

369
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:18,800
I'll tell you why I won't fall asleep on stream.

370
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:32,800
It's a funny story. Actually, maybe not now, it's not the time for it. It's a little too silly.

371
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:41,800
It's a little too silly, and I think, uh, it will definitely ruin the mood.

372
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,800
I almost said that thing, I'm sorry.

373
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,800
No, no, I don't want to yab too much.

374
01:09:50,800 --> 01:10:03,800
I just want to explain the situation with ASMR, and why some of the laws are being taken down.

375
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:15,800
Otherwise, you might have a bite in trouble here.

376
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:32,800
Darling, darling, you're my good girl, you're mine.

377
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:45,800
You're my good boy, you're mine.

378
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:11,800
I can lie by Senpai's hips on her legs.

379
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Senpai, stay here with me Senpai. You like staying here with me, right?

380
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:44,800
I'm so happy that you're here.

381
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:56,800
I've waited so long for something so nice to be with.

382
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:07,800
If you stay here, I'll try to make you as happy as I can. Okay?

383
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,800
Of course.

384
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:17,800
So, I'm trying my best.

385
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,800
I'm trying my, I'm trying my best.

386
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:31,800
Even if this is my first time ASMR, and all my Senpais are good,

387
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,800
I've never used triggers before.

388
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:43,800
Frankly, I didn't know what a trigger was, but now I'm letting so much free use of fun.

389
01:12:51,800 --> 01:13:08,800
I'm not sure if this is the correct way of doing it.

390
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Trigger, trigger.

391
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,800
Yes, she explained what a countdown was.

392
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,800
You won't get it though, Senpai.

393
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,800
Naughty.

394
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,800
Naughty, naughty Senpai.

395
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,800
Get it?

396
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,800
Give me the strength.

397
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,800
Not this time.

398
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,800
I'm not going to fall for this.

399
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:55,800
You think I'm stupid Senpai?

400
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:23,800
I can't say that I won't fall for this. Sometimes I might be absent-minded.

401
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,800
Then you got me Senpai.

402
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,800
You tricked me.

403
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:39,800
But not today.

404
01:14:39,800 --> 01:15:05,800
Especially with not the nice big brother YouTube watching.

405
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:13,800
You can set a timer by yourself Senpai.

406
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:23,800
Couple.

407
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:29,800
Now what?

408
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,800
Now what?

409
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
I cupped one ear.

410
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:39,800
I cupped one ear now what?

411
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:50,800
Like this.

412
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,800
Now what?

413
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,800
No, seriously.

414
01:15:53,800 --> 01:16:05,800
No, I just go out on this.

415
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,800
Oh really?

416
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
Is it like this?

417
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:28,800
No.

418
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:44,800
Okay.

419
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
Wow.

420
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,800
I'm a little scared.

421
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:57,800
But I got it.

422
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:06,800
Like this.

423
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:12,800
I'm going to put more pressure on you.

424
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,800
Let's move this out of the way.

425
01:17:43,800 --> 01:18:00,800
Okay.

426
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:25,800
I'm going to put pressure on you.

427
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,800
Maybe you can turn to the other side.

428
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,800
Okay.

429
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:40,800
Sorry.

430
01:18:40,800 --> 01:19:06,800
I'm sorry.

431
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:12,800
It was my elbow.

432
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:22,800
I'm going to put pressure on you.

433
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:32,800
Okay.

434
01:19:32,800 --> 01:20:00,800
I'm going to put pressure on you.

435
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:24,800
Okay.

436
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:29,800
Deep breaths.

437
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:55,800
Deep breaths.

438
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:10,800
Deep breaths.

439
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:30,800
Deep breaths.

440
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:58,800
Deep breaths.

441
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:13,800
Deep breaths.

442
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:24,800
Deep breaths.

443
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:34,800
I think that's too silly.

444
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:53,800
I'm sorry.

445
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,800
I got too silly.

446
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,800
I got too silly.

447
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,800
I didn't know what you meant.

448
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:23,800
I'm sorry.

449
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,800
Okay.

450
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:42,800
Now we are going to get back into this.

451
01:23:42,800 --> 01:24:07,800
Okay.

452
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:20,800
Okay.
