1
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oops, let me turn this off.

2
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
My music off.

3
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Senpais!

4
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't spoil the game!

5
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh shit, you can see my steam library, fuck.

6
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Ahhhh.

7
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Give us a second.

8
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why aren't you doing DOS?

9
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why aren't you doing the DOS box?

10
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There it is.

11
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's make this a little bit smaller.

12
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I set you up to be

13
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
1920 by 1080.

14
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You stupid game.

15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You stupid game.

16
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's okay.

17
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Welcome Senpais to the stream!

18
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I've literally, literally

19
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
set this up so hard.

20
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've saved it.

21
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I went into the like configuration settings,

22
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
changed everything,

23
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and it's still being a little whole.

24
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Anyways, for those who don't know

25
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
anything about Harvest Starter,

26
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
it is a game made basically as a

27
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
protest against censorship.

28
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So what you're going to see is, of course,

29
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
a lot of maybe edgier stuff.

30
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You might see me canceled in like a day or two, who knows.

31
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's very famous for being quite out there.

32
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I still hear the background.

33
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh shit.

34
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I was so caught up on seeing,

35
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
on making this work that I didn't realize.

36
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There you go.

37
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Wrong one.

38
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Wrong one.

39
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There we go.

40
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You just missed a little bit of the opening.

41
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We can watch it again.

42
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Just kidding.

43
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So this is the hatred of past generations.

44
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There's a lot of games and movies

45
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and even animes back in the 90s

46
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that were protest against censorship.

47
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A famous one, a famous anime,

48
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that some of my senpais might know,

49
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it's called General Cyber,

50
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
which is, which dubs itself

51
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
as the most violent anime ever made.

52
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's also a protest against censorship as well.

53
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So make sure.

54
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So games of this time,

55
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the censorship was, of course,

56
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
due to the...

57
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think basically the scare where every...

58
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh gosh, it's been a while since I did this study.

59
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But at this point, it'll be games that are evil

60
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and makes your kids satanists

61
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and makes your kids all bad and stuff.

62
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And so here, you can just say moral panic.

63
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Mercy, thank you.

64
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Everyone is up in arms about video games.

65
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So what do they do?

66
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They go,

67
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
what if we can make it worse?

68
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What if we can make it worse?

69
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So here we are with Arvester.

70
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh come on, there we go.

71
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Actually, let me move my screen a little bit for me.

72
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I've set you up to be like the perfect ratio,

73
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and now it's still windowed.

74
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Can you believe it?

75
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So pretty much,

76
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think this was the time when people saw...

77
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I need to remember, mind you,

78
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I did this study a couple, a few years ago.

79
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So this was a long time ago, so my memory is still shot.

80
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But this is probably like...

81
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Was it Nightcrawler?

82
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Nightcrawler, kind of like scare moral panic there.

83
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Where, you know, Nightcrawler is like a bunch of creeper,

84
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
like ninja things.

85
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Night trap, yes.

86
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Not Nightcrawler.

87
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, Nighttrap, where a bunch of ninja things

88
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
are coming in for these girls' sleepovers.

89
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Did you tweet you are alive?

90
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No?

91
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I guess I'll go do that now, Senpai.

92
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I guess I'll do that now, Senpai.

93
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't believe.

94
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I always forget.

95
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think I'm still in the mindset of...

96
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hold on, I need to get the...

97
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What do you call it?

98
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The thumbnail, and then I gotta...

99
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then I'll post it up.

100
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I have to go to the waiting room and everything.

101
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Not the waiting room, the stream.

102
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And post it up too.

103
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh boy, I reminded myself earlier, I'll do it.

104
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And then I got distracted by pretzels.

105
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I got distracted by chocolate-covered pretzels.

106
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So I ate a few.

107
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And a piece of cheese.

108
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay, give me a second.

109
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Sorry, Senpais.

110
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I think I'm still not quite used to being...

111
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Being, you know, here.

112
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Let's go to my YouTube studio.

113
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Content.

114
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And let's do...

115
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Get a shareable link.

116
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Post it right there.

117
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Remove the HTTPS.

118
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Right here.

119
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Am I on the right account? Check.

120
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh.

121
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Somebody posted tag me and something, gotta retweet it.

122
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We'll reply to it later.

123
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There we go!

124
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yay!

125
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I always forget.

126
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I always forget, because...

127
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't want to go much into my past life.

128
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Because I want to keep my past life on the down low.

129
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But...

130
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You know, back then I never really made a schedule and just went,

131
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I want to play!

132
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I want to play this! Let's go! Bam!

133
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But yeah, I prefer to keep my past life on the down low,

134
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
but since we're allowed in VLOR, just by the way,

135
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
we are allowed to talk about our past life in VLOR.

136
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I just want to keep it on the DL,

137
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
because, essentially...

138
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Essentially, we are different people.

139
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Now I have to schedule entire weeks beforehand.

140
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah.

141
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hi, Mercy. What's being harvested?

142
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm not sure.

143
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But right now, I'm bringing it up just to tell you why.

144
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
To tell you why, I haven't exactly gotten used to...

145
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
used to pulsing up that I'm live or anything.

146
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's like...

147
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What? What? What do you mean, Mercy?

148
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Why are you saying Mercy?

149
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
SEMPAI!

150
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Speak!

151
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay.

152
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's show tips.

153
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Use the right mouse button to attack an opponent.

154
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

155
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Left click on your character or press I to view inventory.

156
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Left click on an object to grab it,

157
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and right click to put it in inventory.

158
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
A penny saved is hardly worth the effort.

159
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Use the left mouse button to move your character around the screen.

160
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If you're stuck on a puzzle, talk to other characters,

161
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and they will give you clues.

162
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Avoid cliches like the plague.

163
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Ammunition is precious, so don't waste it.

164
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
If you get stuck in a puzzle, try using items in crazy, illogical ways.

165
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay, yeah, that's... that's part...

166
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's part of the...

167
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's part of point and click, so let's be real.

168
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Save your game often,

169
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
especially before trying something crazy, illogical, or dangerous.

170
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Holding down the control button plus the arrow keys allow you to attack opponents.

171
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Look before you leap.

172
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The help screen can be helpful, or better yet, read the manual.

173
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Speaking of, I haven't read the manual.

174
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's a point and click with combat, it seems.

175
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose,

176
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
but you can't pick your friend's nose.

177
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh yeah, bet!

178
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This has a manual. Yeah, it looks like it has a manual.

179
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I can pull it up, probably.

180
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'd have to... have to pull it up, though.

181
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'd have to... have to pull it up, though.

182
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Right clicking on objects in inventory shows a close-up of that object.

183
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Right clicking on weapons in inventory activates and deactivates them.

184

Press escape to bring up menu options.

185
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You can combine objects into new objects by clicking and dragging items on one another.

186
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Sound levels can be adjusted in the options menu.

187
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Screen too dark, try adjusting the gamma on the option menu.

188
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Check your photo on the inventory screen.

189
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It will get worse as you take more damage.

190
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Look for special items that will restore your health.

191
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
After finding required items during the day, night will be the time of mischievous adventure.

192
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Double-click the left mouse button on an exit to go through instantly.

193

Use the right mouse button to attack an opponent.

194
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh wait, okay, whatever, we're going back in circles now.

195
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Thank you!

196
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's look around!

197
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
A pair of plastic binoculars with lenses melted onto the table.

198
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
How hot is it?

199
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
An empty acne medication container.

200
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Ah, we're teens.

201
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
A photo of a beautiful girl blonde about 17 years old.

202
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
A sexy pinup.

203
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I can't, I can't whistle.

204
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Psst!

205
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Never mind.

206
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
One of your typical wall clocks.

207
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I've never seen a wall clock like that ever!

208
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Paper doll by the mill's brother sits on the turntable.

209
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know, like, record players are really popular.

210
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Senpai, do you have a record player?

211
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The dresser drawer is unlocked.

212
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Open it then!

213
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I take a 25 cent piece dated 1952.

214
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Take it.

215
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Chew marks are visible on the end of this ballpoint pen.

216
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Take it.

217
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
As of yet, the future isn't so bright.

218
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Can I take it?

219
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Is there anything else in here?

220
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We're good.

221
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
About any other drawers?

222
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh no, it's just the one drawer.

223
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay.

224
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You peer through a thin layer of dust at your reflection.

225
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Seven flannel shirts accompanied with matching blue jeans

226
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
are hanging neatly in the closet.

227
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I have records, but no record player.

228
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I got a tape player.

229
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I have a tape player too!

230
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's like a tape player and radio.

231
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I found it, I found it in the shed.

232
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I found it in the shed.

233
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's Bugs Bunny.

234
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's got Bugs Bunny on it.

235
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Actually, remember getting this tape player.

236
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Okay, here.

237
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's walk, mister.

238
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh, what's in the trash can?

239
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
An empty trash can, so clean you can eat from it.

240
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Anything else?

241
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Did this require anything?

242
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh, maybe the drawer?

243
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No.

244
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The mattress is speckled with odd stains.

245
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
A 148 scale P47 Thunderbolt with a broken propeller.

246
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
How about this one?

247
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
A hastily glued P51 Mustang in exactly a 136 scale.

248
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Oh, oh no!

249
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh no, Senpai!

250
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh no, Senpai!

251
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh no!

252
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm gonna have to BRB real fast.

253
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I think I have an idle meeting.

254
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

359
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

360
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

361
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

362
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

363
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

364
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

365
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

366
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

367
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

368
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

369
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000

I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

373
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

374
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I have an idle meeting I must attend right now.

375
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Build

376
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Are you playing ping pong again Senpai?

377
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Get back into your cages and start watching me!

378
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:51,320
I did wash my hands, yes I did.

379
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,560
You want to watch me game or what?

380
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Did Marcy pull an Emmy?

381
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
What the Emmy pull?

382
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Your finger?

383
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:26,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

384
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:36,560
I haven't even told about the mom yet?

385
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Who's mom?

386
00:37:39,560 --> 00:38:03,560
I'm gonna save the game just in case I step out of this room and then I decide to die.

387
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Oh my gosh, a box of crayons and a range rider coloring book.

388
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,560
What's this?

389
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Fine bone china gleams from the mahogany shelves.

390
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Can I look at the crack in the ceiling?

391
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Why is there so many?

392
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Okay, first off, why is there two fire extinguishers?

393
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
A box full of newspapers.

394
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,560
That's a lot of newspapers.

395
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,560
The stunning depiction of the earth made of paper mache.

396
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Not even plastic, okay.

397
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,560
This house is very safety conscious.

398
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Everything was flammable, okay.

399
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,560
What?

400
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,560
What?

401
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Who are you?

402
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,560
You wouldn't.

403
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Mom.

404
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Do you know me?

405
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Do you know me?

406
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:57,560
I am a shit brother.

407
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,560
Mom, Steve is bugging me.

408
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Okay.

409
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,560
Yo, lousy rat.

410
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Listen here, you little shit.

411
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:23,560
I'm actually the youngest sibling, so I was the little shit.

412
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Steve.

413
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Wow, we have such a short temper.

414
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,560
You always wear a kidder, Steve.

415
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,560
I'm sick.

416
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Uh, tell me about your cowboy show.

417
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,560
On TV?

418
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,560
You think?

419
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Yeah, I think so too.

420
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Blood and guts are needle.

421
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,560
What should I say, Senpai?

422
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,560
Should I be the half full big brother?

423
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Or should I just be like, yeah, you're right.

424
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,560
That's really neat.

425
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,560
You're not too bad for a lousy rat.

426
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,560
It's like they're talking about any.

427
00:41:49,560 --> 00:42:02,560
I said any like a belly button.

428
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
Sick.

429
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,560
What's wrong with you?

430
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:18,560
I'm gonna watch my cowboy show.

431
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,560
So shut up.

432
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:30,560
Shut up.

433
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Magnesia stuff.

434
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,560
I don't understand.

435
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,560
Okay kid, you're being a lot of stuff.

436
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:00,560
You're saying you're doing a lot of foreshadowing here.

437
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:08,560
That I don't know what you're foreshadowing.

438
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,560
Mercy, don't look up any of the names in this game.

439
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Like Steve?

440
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Don't worry.

441
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,560
You want creepy child mode?

442
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,560
You have to sing lullapies very quietly.

443
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Have you noticed that your show...

444
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,560
Oh wait.

445
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,560
I already picked that one.

446
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,560
Alright, it's really neat.

447
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
What's this other?

448
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Well, I can type stuff.

449
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Stinky.

450
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Say what?

451
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,560
You're adopted.

452
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Say what?

453
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,560
Ring around the rosy.

454
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,560
You know like...

455
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,560
Rock-a-bye baby on a tree top.

456
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,560
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.

457
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,560
When the bow breaks, the cradle will fall.

458
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:42,560
And down will come baby, cradle and all.

459
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Is that creepy for you guys?

460
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:55,560
This baby freaking fell from a tree.

461
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,560
No?

462
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:05,560
It's not creepy.

463
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:14,560
I guess like another one you think about it.

464
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,560
You singing it didn't sound creepy.

465
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,560
Mary, Mary, oh contrary.

466
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,560
How does your garden grow?

467
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,560
Have cockroach shells?

468
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,560
And I forgot was...

469
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,560
What's the other flower?

470
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,560
Something rhymes with bells.

471
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:47,560
And pretty maids all laid in a row.

472
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Wait, did we ask about daddy yet?

473
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
Your dad is asleep?

474
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,560
He and mom went at it last night pretty hard.

475
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,560
Wait what?

476
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
He stayed in bed.

477
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,560
I saw what she did to him.

478
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,560
It was pretty bad.

479
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
What did she...

480
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,560
What is she?

481
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,560
Like you don't know.

482
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,560
I saw you and her on the couch last Wednesday night.

483
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,560
Guess that's why she's grounded now, huh?

484
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,560
Too bad you wouldn't pay me and I had to tell, huh?

485
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,560
What are you talking about?

486
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,560
What girl?

487
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,560
What?

488
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,560
Is there another one too?

489
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,560
Wait till I tell.

490
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Ezra!

491
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:44,560
Welcome to the stream!

492
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Welcome Raiders!

493
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,560
Welcome to the stream!

494
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
Sorry, did I miss that?

495
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,560
But did we just...

496
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,560
You know, did we just f*** our mom?

497
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:03,560
Or did we f*** someone else?

498
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:13,560
Ask, ask what?

499
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:23,560
I have to ask?

500
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,560
No wait, he said something about the couch.

501
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:33,560
Like I saw you and mom on the couch and I'm like...

502
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,560
Okay fine, I'll ask it right there.

503
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,560
Oh Ezra, you're making me blush.

504
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Oh you're such a kidder.

505
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,560
You're making me blush, Ezra.

506
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,560
Now he just said her.

507
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,560
Her, her.

508
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Okay, her is girl.

509
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,560
Okay, let me check.

510
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,560
Girl.

511
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,560
Girl.

512
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,560
I don't know what girl you're talking about.

513
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,560
All summer, it's been Stephanie this.

514
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
Stephanie that.

515
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
And now you don't remember?

516
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,560
You think I'm dumb or something?

517
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,560
No, I just can't remember anything like I said.

518
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Well you better remember quit.

519
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,560
Cause the wedding's in two weeks.

520
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,560
What?

521
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,560
Leave me alone so I can watch TV.

522
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
TV?

523
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,560
That's a weird looking television.

524
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,560
Come to think of it, this whole place looks totally retro.

525
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,560
What do you mean retro?

526
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,560
All TVs look alike.

527
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Sure, basically.

528
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,560
You didn't say mom.

529
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,560
This whole fashion clunker.

530
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,560
Whole fashion?

531
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,560
Looks brand new.

532
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,560
Yeah, but look at the tube.

533
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,560
Where's the remote control?

534
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,560
Where's the tube?

535
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,560
What's that?

536
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,560
What's that?

537
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,560
No but I think about it.

538
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,560
I can't remember.

539
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,560
And what was that you said?

540
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,560
I thought retro rockets?

541
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,560
No, retro, it means...

542
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,560
It means...

543
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,560
Oh man, I know what I mean.

544
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,560
That everything here is wrong.

545
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,560
But I can't picture the difference.

546
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,560
And shut up and quit bugging me.

547
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,560
I'm lost in my cowboy show.

548
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,560
What wedding?

549
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,560
Wait, hold on.

550
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,560
What wedding?

551
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
First off.

552
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
What else?

553
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,560
Well, I...

554
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,560
Yeah, you're right.

555
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,560
It's great.

556
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,560
Okay, shut up.

557
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,560
What wedding?

558
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,560
Say what?

559
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,560
Pick your nose.

560
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,560
I saw the nose wrong.

561
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,560
No.

562
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,560
Say what?

563
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,560
Boop.

564
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,560
Say what?

565
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Adopt it.

566
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
Adopt it.

567
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
Say what?

568
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,560
You're adopted, kid.

569
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,560
Try Stephanie.

570
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,560
Stephanie.

571
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Say what?

572
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,560
Oh fuck this kid.

573
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
Good.

574
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,560
Finally.

575
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,560
Wait till I get my grabby little hands on you.

576
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,560
We're at...

577
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,560
Good.

578
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,560
Let me alone, Claudia.

579
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,560
This is the good part.

580
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,560
I see.

581
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,560
Uh, was it Stephanie Girl?

582
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,560
I don't know what girl you're talking about.

583
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,560
Thank you.

584
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,560
All summer, it's been Stephanie this and Stephanie that.

585
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,560
And now you don't remember?

586
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,560
You think I'm dumb or something?

587
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,560
No, I just can't remember anything, like I said.

588
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,560
Well, you better remember quit.

589
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,560
Because the wedding's in two weeks.

590
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,560
What?

591
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,560
Let me alone so I can watch TV.

592
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,560
Stephanie.

593
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,560
I said I don't want to talk about her anymore.

594
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,560
I said...

595
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,560
All right.

596
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,560
See ya.

597
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,560
Good.

598
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,560
Man, what a bratty brother I have.

599
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,560
Just spank him.

600
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,560
Is that mom?

601
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,560
What's this?

602
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,560
An expertly embroidered old fashioned wall plaque.

603
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,560
Cookies are baking in the oven.

604
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,560
A newborn is sleeping soundly.

605
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,560
A cabinet that smells of dirty diapers.

606
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Dirty diapers?

607
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,560
Shouldn't they be clean?

608
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,560
Have you tried putting the entire English dictionary into the chat box

609
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,560
and tried to trigger everything at once?

610
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,560
I don't think so.

611
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,560
These cookies are hot out of the oven.

612
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,560
All right.

613
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,560
Oh, there is.

614
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,560
Uh-huh.

615
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,560
Oh, he says Josh.

616
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,560
What job?

617
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,560
We've already established this, Steve.

618
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,560
I'm going to fall asleep to Marysie.

619
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,560
You may fall asleep to me.

620
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,560
Hold on.

621
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,560
Mwah.

622
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,560
Now, tuck you in.

623
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,560
Here you go.

624
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,560
I have a sister?

625
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,560
Oh, wait.

626
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,560
Is it the baby?

627
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,560
The baby?

628
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,560
The baby.

629
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,560
OK.

630
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,560
Let's go through all this.

631
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Graduation.

632
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,560
When did we graduate?

633
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,560
Four months ago.

634
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
All you need to get a job.

635
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,560
And besides, you can't marry Stephanie if you're going to waste your time going to college.

636
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,560
This is the first time I've ever seen someone say,

637
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,560
don't go to college.

638
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,560
It's a disgrace, but better late than never.

639
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,560
I guess we can thank Stephanie for that.

640
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,560
All right.

641
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,560
This is the first.

642
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,560
All right, Stephanie.

643
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,560
And just who is Stephanie?

644
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,560
Don't you dare toy with that sweet girl.

645
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,560
If you start in on her with all this amnesia poop,

646
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,560
she'll think her fiance is having second thoughts about the wedding.

647
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,560
Wedding?

648
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,560
Look, all this talk about weddings is nuts.

649
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,560
I'm not marrying anybody till I figure out what's going on here.

650
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,560
First, the heartbreak of psoriasis.

651
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,560
Psoriasis?

652
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,560
Two weeks before the wedding and you're backing out.

653
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,560
Whatever will the neighbors think?

654
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,560
I can't marry someone I don't even know.

655
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Fine, have it your way, but leave me out of it.

656
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,560
If you're going to break Stephanie's heart,

657
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,560
you march right next door and do it yourself.

658
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,560
And don't expect me to write you a note.

659
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,560
Okay.

660
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,560
Fiance?

661
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,560
Fiance?

662
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,560
Fiance?

663
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,560
This is insane.

664
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,560
Oh, you're not having second thoughts about marrying Stephanie.

665
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Is that what this silliness is all about?

666
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,560
Pre-wedding jitters?

667
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,560
Can something like that produce amnesia?

668
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,560
Stop this foolishness right now and count your blessings.

669
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,560
Stephanie is great at cooking and cleaning.

670
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
Cooking and cleaning?

671
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,560
What's cooking and cleaning got to do with anything?

672
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,560
Honestly, boys are so dense.

673
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,560
What else is there for a wife but cooking and cleaning?

674
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,560
You may not appreciate a hot meal on a clean plate when it's there,

675
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,560
but if it wasn't, we'd hear about it soon enough, I'll bet.

676
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,560
You're saying that's all there is to marriage.

677
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,560
Cooking and cleaning?

678
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,560
No!

679
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,560
You'll have to ask your father about that,

680
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,560
but I'm sure Stephanie will do her duty.

681
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,560
Her duty?

682
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,560
Don't worry so far.

683
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,560
I'll do my duty too when we get married.

684
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,560
Marriage is more than cooking and cleaning.

685
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,560
It's about loving each other

686
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,560
and being there for each other for all of eternity.

687
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,560
Right?

688
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,560
I said right!

689
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
Okay.

690
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,560
Good!

691
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,560
So fly, good!

692
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

693
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

694
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,560
Ha!

695
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Someone say no?

696
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,560
Mom, scut off his testicles!

697
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,560
Are there testicles?

698
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,560
I don't actually know.

699
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,560
Thank you!

700
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,560
Thank you, mods!

701
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,560
You're welcome.

702
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,560
You'll have them back once Emmy wakes up.

703
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,560
Okay, let's talk about our duty.

704
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,560
Or should we talk about our father?

705
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,560
Ha ha, duty.

706
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,560
They grow back?

707
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,560
They always grow back, don't you know?

708
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,560
We should talk about duty, huh?

709
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,560
Disgusting truths.

710
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,560
Lexingogos?

711
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,560
Your baby was Stephanie.

712
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,560
You'll have to make your peace with the fact that

713
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,560
when a farmer plants his seed,

714
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,560
he can't help but get some nasty dirt on his hoe.

715
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,560
Not on his hoe!

716
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,560
Mother!

717
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,560
You can't use such language around here.

718
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,560
We should treasure the love they have.

719
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,560
Or maybe if there's no love.

720
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
You know what?

721
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,560
If there's no love, no marriage, okay?

722
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,560
But clearly, there has to be love.

723
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,560
Oh, why goggles?

724
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,560
Goggles is such a strange thing.

725
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,560
You know, like, goggle boots, right?

726
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Like, they're really long boots.

727
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,560
Oh, let's talk about our father now.

728
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,560
My father.

729
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,560
He's in the other room.

730
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,560
He decided to sleep in today.

731
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,560
Now please, let me get back to my cookies.

732
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,560
Cookies?

733
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,560
The bake sale was on Friday,

734
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,560
and yet you're baking the cookies now.

735
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,560
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.

736
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,560
But they'll be stale by then.

737
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,560
That's why I'm throwing them away.

738
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,560
And then cooking more?

739
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,560
To replace the ones I throw out.

740
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,560
Why?

741
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Well, I have to.

742
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,560
No one's going to pay to eat stale cookies out of the garbage can.

743
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,560
But you expect me to?

744
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,560
Of course not, Steve.

745
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
I wouldn't charge you.

746
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,560
I'm your mother.

747
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,560
Help yourself.

748
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,560
You would charge me to eat cookies out of the trash can?

749
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,560
You wouldn't have done that, mommy?

750
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,560
All right.

751
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,560
Let's get some garbage cookies.

752
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,560
What charity is this bake sale supposed to benefit?

753
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,560
It'll help provide a fund for bums and hobos who wander into harvest

754
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,560
and have no family ties.

755
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,560
Kind of a specific target group, isn't it?

756
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,560
Yeah, that's pretty specific to detail when dealing with such people.

757
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,560
I don't know what you mean.

758
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,560
You will.

759
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,560
The whole thing has been organized by the lodge.

760
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,560
The lodge?

761
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,560
The lodge?

762
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,560
What lodge?

763
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,560
What's so great about it?

764
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,560
It sounds like a call.

765
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,560
No one gets inside, but it wouldn't be so exclusive if it wasn't just wonderful.

766
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,560
Just like the new Reynolds dishwasher with their patented auto dry process TM.

767
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,560
I've never used one, but I know I want it.

768
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,560
Instead of sulking around the house all day,

769
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,560
why not walk over to the lodge and apply for membership?

770
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,560
The last thing I want is a fizz on my head.

771
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,560
Don't be so hasty, Steve.

772
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,560
I think you'll find harvest is a pretty dull place without the lodge.

773
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,560
You sound like the membership director.

774
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,560
Don't be silly.

775
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,560
I just want what's best for you.

776
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,560
That's all.

777
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,560
Harvest, harvest.

778
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,560
I don't remember the song.

779
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,560
Nice product placement, though.

780
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:30,560
I think my dishwasher is over 20 years old.

781
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:44,560
Harvest is a town unlike any you've ever known.

782
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,560
In what way?

783
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,560
Yeah.

784
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,560
I don't have time to go into it now.

785
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,560
Why not take a walk around town and pester someone else?

786
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,560
I'm busy.

787
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,560
Okay, bye, mom.

788
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,560
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

789
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,560
You know how he gets.

790
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,560
Wait, we put the papers out for Jimmy?

791
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,560
Freshly baked cookies are in the trash can.

792
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,560
Can I take a look at them?

793
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,560
Well, I guess I'll grab.

794
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,560
Yeah, it's there.

795
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,560
House indicator.

796
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,560
I'm fine.

797
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,560
Harvest land, furniture, warehouse.

798
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,560
Okay.

799
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,560
The master bedroom door is firmly locked.

800
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,560
Is that my father?

801
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,560
I could have taken a look at the baby.

802
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,560
I can newborn baby is sleeping soundly.

803
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,560
He's eating.

804
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,560
Now he doesn't sound healthy.

805
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,560
Sounds like one of my, my senpai's dad.

806
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,560
Oh boy.

807
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:06,560
Now I'm squealing wickedly in the kitchen's antiseptic glow.

808
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,560
Mom.

809
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,560
I told you I'm busy, Steve.

810
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,560
Why don't you talk to him?

811
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,560
I'm busy.

812
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,560
I'm busy.

813
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,560
I'm busy.

814
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,560
I'm busy.

815
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,560
I'm busy.

816
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,560
I'm busy.

817
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,560
I'm busy.

818
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,560
I'm busy.

819
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,560
Steve, why don't you talk to Hank

820
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,560
or go next door and visit Stephanie

821
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,560
or go get an early start on your new job.

822
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,560
Hank?

823
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,560
Hank.

824
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,560
That kid over by the television?

825
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,560
Your little brother is home sick from school today

826
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,560
and I won't have you scaring him with this amnesia poop.

827
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,560
Is he really sick?

828
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,560
Look at the show he's watching.

829
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,560
Wouldn't you say he's sick?

830
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,560
I'd make him stop, but oh, I'm so busy

831
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,560
baking cookies for the Harvest PPA charity bake sale.

832
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,560
It's on Friday, you know.

833
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,560
I hope you're still planning on going.

834
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,560
I don't know.

835
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,560
I need to think.

836
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,560
Honestly, skipping out of a charity affair.

837
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,560
What's gotten into you?

838
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,560
I don't know.

839
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,560
Damn it.

840
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,560
That's what I'm telling you.

841
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,560
Don't you dare use that language around me.

842
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,560
Oh, my goodness.

843
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,560
Your father didn't hear you or Stephanie

844
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,560
for that matter.

845
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:12,560
How do you think she'd feel knowing her fiance was a gutter mess?

846
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:21,560
Wait, did I talk about my father yet?

847
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,560
Didn't I foul a language?

848
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,560
Shit.

849
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:30,560
Stop speaking nonsense, dear.

850
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,560
Bitch.

851
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:39,560
Stop speaking nonsense, dear.

852
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,560
Fuck.

853
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,560
What a thing to say to your mother.

854
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,560
Was that an invitation now that your father is out of action?

855
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:16,560
I'm flabbergasted.

856
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,560
I'm flabbergasted.

857
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,560
I guess we got to pick the first one.

858
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,560
We got to pick the first one.

859
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:30,560
I guess we have to pick the first one.

860
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,560
I mean, everyone has as around the line, right?

861
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,560
Well, we're here.

862
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,560
Let's go.

863
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,560
Yeah, how about it, mommy?

864
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,560
Maybe later, dear.

865
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,560
Right now I have housework to do.

866
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,560
So you can watch if you want.

867
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,560
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

868
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,560
You know how he gets.

869
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:17,560
My mouth is a gait.

870
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:28,560
She said maybe later.

871
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:37,560
We got a maybe?

872
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,560
There's a glow from behind the cabinet.

873
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:49,560
Can I punch my bro?

874
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,560
What do I do if I say fuck to him?

875
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,560
No, nothing, OK.

876
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:58,560
Bye.

877
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,560
Why is there a glow there?

878
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,560
Can I?

879
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:09,560
Come on, walk.

880
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:13,560
What's that glow?

881
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:19,560
Can I push it?

882
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,560
Remember to say before you do anything crazy,

883
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,560
I got the paper.

884
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:32,560
Right here, I have the paper.

885
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:42,560
What happened?

886
01:07:42,560 --> 01:08:01,560
What is this?

887
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,560
What a bag!

888
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,560
What a bag in the inventory!

889
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:17,560
Oh no, is this the paper?

890
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,560
What did I do, Aya?

891
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:38,560
Aya!

892
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,560
Tempai!

893
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,560
It's stuck!

894
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,560
It's stuck!

895
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,560
Can you hear that?

896
01:08:51,560 --> 01:09:01,560
It's making the t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t sound.

897
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,560
Now everything's frozen!

898
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,560
Aya!

899
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Aya!

900
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:21,560
Aya, Tempai!

901
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,560
Don't look, Tempai!

902
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,560
Don't look at my...

903
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,560
No, that's not it.

904
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:37,560
Don't look at my steam.

905
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:49,560
Don't look at my steam.

906
01:09:49,560 --> 01:10:04,560
Oh now it decides to play in fullscreen stupid game.

907
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,560
Never mind, I decided not to go in fullscreen anymore.

908
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,560
Hello?

909
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:17,560
Hello?

910
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,560
Are you gonna...

911
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,560
Are you gonna show up?

912
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:37,560
Okay, there we go. We're fine now.

913
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:48,560
Can I skip?

914
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:56,560
Wait, no, I have a save file. Load game.

915
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:08,560
Or okay.

916
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:13,560
Guess we should save more often.

917
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:23,560
Okay, let's skip through this.

918
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,560
Eddie.

919
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,560
Girl.

920
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,560
Stephanie.

921
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,560
Phoebe.

922
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:44,560
There we go.

923
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:50,560
I saved before the brother, which sucks.

924
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:59,560
Cowboy.

925
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:03,560
Oops.

926
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,560
Bye.

927
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:14,560
Bye.

928
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,560
Guess we go talk to mom now.

929
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:26,560
At least we can speedrun him being a brat, yeah.

930
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:39,560
Talk to mom.

931
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:44,560
Okay.

932
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,560
Stephanie.

933
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:51,560
Wedding.

934
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,560
Beyonce.

935
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:01,560
Cooking and cleaning.

936
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,560
Father.

937
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:12,560
Cookies.

938
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,560
Uh, job. I remember it was job.

939
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:26,560
I didn't actually talk about the job. What was my job?

940
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,560
Just like anybody else.

941
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:44,560
Oh, my dad's work? Slaughterhouse.

942
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:59,560
Mom, your voice changed.

943
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:07,560
Uh, did we talk about lodge again?

944
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:16,560
Uh, why not? I go look into it.

945
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,560
Harvest.

946
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:27,560
Uh, I guess we can say, does anyone else know if we can say something else?

947
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:44,560
Cause, I don't know, I guess we can do this again.

948
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:52,560
It still shocks me each time.

949
01:14:52,560 --> 01:15:02,560
Dirty diapers. Knives.

950
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,560
Embroidery.

951
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,560
Let's get out of here.

952
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,560
Escape save game.

953
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:20,560
Let's save it over this game file.

954
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:31,560
Let's get box one newspapers. Let's grab the newspaper.

955
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:41,560
I said grab the newspaper.

956
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:56,560
I wonder if, if, if I need to, if I, if I can check it.

957
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:02,560
Let's save again.

958
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:10,560
Let's save again to see if that newspaper breaks again.

959
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:18,560
Can I, how do I look at it? Does anyone remember how to look at it?

960
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:32,560
I guess it didn't break again.

961
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:39,560
Did I double click? I can't remember how to look at it. Right click to look at it.

962
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:46,560
Well, it's not, not doing anything.

963
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:59,560
Now, whatever.

964
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:04,560
This kid wants the paper, right?

965
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,560
Here you go.

966
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,560
No.

967
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,560
Hey Steve, you've been doing a swell drop putting the paper out in the morning.

968
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:21,560
You just keep doing that and we won't have any problems. That's not much to ask, is it?

969
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,560
No.

970
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,560
See you later alligator.

971
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,560
Okay, see you later alligator.

972
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:32,560
Full of junk, mail, bills and bake sale flyers.

973
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:41,560
Is that? There are security bars fastened to the window with Phillip head screws.

974
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:47,560
The day glow lima space disc stuck on the roof.

975
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:53,560
An Army surplus air conditioner.

976
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:58,560
Okay, this kid's acting a little hard for like, you know.

977
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,560
See you later alligator.

978
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:08,560
Okay, so I have to give him the paper every day.

979
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:25,560
Can I see the paper?

980
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,560
Your house, general store or Stephanie's house?

981
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,560
Oh, huh?

982
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:41,560
Potsdam's residence.

983
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,560
The garage needs some new paint job.

984
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:50,560
Glass is so clear the reflection makes it difficult to see.

985
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,560
Must have rained recently.

986
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:59,560
That window is shaped like a wagon wheel.

987
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,560
Hi.

988
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:12,560
The man of the house squeezing his mate.

989
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:18,560
Wait, I soft blocked myself. What do you mean?

990
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,560
There he is, my future son-in-law. And how's he doing today?

991
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,560
What brings him to the Potsdam household?

992
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:35,560
I came to see Stephanie.

993
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,560
Oh, you'll have to ask the missus about that.

994
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,560
Stephanie's grounded to the wedding.

995
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:57,560
Can't have her changing her mind at the last minute. Not with all that meat at stake.

996
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,560
Me?

997
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,560
I haven't seen my father. He's locked in a room.

998
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,560
He's not going to die, is he?

999
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:13,560
Like I said, I don't know. That woman, Mom, tends to him herself.

1000
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,560
Well, next time you see him, be sure to tell him that I said hello.

1001
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,560
And tell him that I'm praying for his speedy recovery.

1002
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:27,560
And also, would you remind him about the meat? Especially about the meat?

1003
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,560
Yeah, fine. If I see him.

1004
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:36,560
You should be concerned. If he dies, then who's going to take over the slaughterhouse?

1005
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,560
Who's going to tend to the meat?

1006
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,560
Why is it meat?

1007
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,560
You'd take over, right?

1008
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,560
Slaughterhouse?

1009
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:54,560
I can't imagine a better job than working in a slaughterhouse.

1010
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,560
I think working in a slaughterhouse might be cool.

1011
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:04,560
Bite your tongue with that serpent's tooth. Your dead slaughterhouse is the most successful business in harvest.

1012
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,560
Oh, okay. Never mind. You got me angry at that.

1013
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,560
You'll love it there.

1014
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,560
Oh, sure. Cutting animals open may not be much fun. Reaching into their bodies...

1015
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,560
Uh-huh.

1016
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,560
Oh, wait. Actually, this is fine.

1017
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:23,560
...testing, dangling, and slapping against you the smell of death and shit in your nostrils all the time.

1018
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,560
That's fine.

1019
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,560
Those are all definite cons of what you're done.

1020
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:33,560
The guts have been washed into the gutters. What have you left with them?

1021
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,560
Meat.

1022
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,560
Rose and rose.

1023
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,560
Did the audio go weird?

1024
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,560
Is that supposed to happen?

1025
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,560
Was that supposed to happen?

1026
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:16,560
That was a little bit spooky. That was kind of spooky. That surprised me when that happened.

1027
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,560
Yeah, let's talk more about the meat.

1028
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,560
Oh.

1029
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,560
I might have to turn the volume down if that happens again.

1030
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,560
Meat is the foundation of any decent society.

1031
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,560
Everyone needs at least five servings of red meat a day.

1032
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,560
And anyone who says otherwise is a commie.

1033
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,560
A commie?

1034
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:47,560
And once you're married to Stephanie, I'll be part of the family, too.

1035
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,560
And your father will give me all the meat I want.

1036
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,560
Time to make some for not getting into the lodge.

1037
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,560
It sounds so grainy.

1038
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,560
Is that supposed to happen?

1039
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,560
Did I break the game?

1040
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,560
Again?

1041
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,560
Or is it just like that?

1042
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,560
Yeah, let's talk about the meat.

1043
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:24,560
I don't like how he's talking about father's meat. Yeah, me neither.

1044
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:33,560
Meat is the foundation of any decent society. Everyone needs at least three servings of red meat a day.

1045
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,560
Alright, we already asked about that. Got it, father.

1046
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,560
I haven't seen my father.

1047
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,560
Like I said.

1048
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,560
Well, next time you see him.

1049
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,560
Yeah, fuck.

1050
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,560
You should be more concerned.

1051
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,560
Um...

1052
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,560
Bye?

1053
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,560
Also, almost made of leather.

1054
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,560
It's polyester.

1055
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,560
The upholster you stained after years of profuse sweating.

1056
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,560
A futary urn in this cabinet so occupant.

1057
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:17,560
A giant mutant asparagus?

1058
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:22,560
Inexplicably robust given the fact that it's encased in red concrete.

1059
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,560
Perhaps the health... healthful electromagnetic fields of harvest.

1060
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,560
Why is it sounding like this?

1061
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,560
Hello, Steve. Have you lost a day?

1062
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,560
You look just like my mom except for the hair.

1063
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:57,560
Honestly, you man can insult a woman without even knowing you've done it.

1064
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,560
What a horrible thing to say.

1065
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,560
Oh, you don't like my mom?

1066
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,560
Same kind of dress. Same pearls.

1067
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,560
So bizarre.

1068
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,560
There's nothing bizarre about baking cookies.

1069
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,560
The harvest charity bake-so is Friday, you know, and by gosh,

1070
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,560
Mrs. Marvin Potson Jr. can be counted on to do her share.

1071
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,560
Pearls.

1072
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,560
Just because I'm doing housework doesn't mean I have to be a drudge.

1073
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,560
It's a wife's duty to look good for her husband at all times.

1074
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,560
What's wrong with wearing pearls for heaven's sake?

1075
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,560
Nothing, but you look like June Cleaver.

1076
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,560
Some kind of sitcom, Mom.

1077
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,560
sitcom?

1078
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,560
Geez, you know, a situation comedy.

1079
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,560
The weird part is, I can't remember how I know that.

1080
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:47,560
I'm much too busy with housework to watch TV.

1081
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,560
Maybe Mr. Potson would know about sitcoms.

1082
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,560
sitcoms?

1083
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,560
Somebody doesn't watch TV though. She's grounded.

1084
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,560
Why is she grounded?

1085
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,560
Mr. Potson feels there's too much at stake to allow Stephanie to run around with.

1086
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,560
She doesn't want to get married either, huh?

1087
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,560
Uh-huh.

1088
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,560
Are you saying you don't want to marry my daughter?

1089
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,560
I don't know your daughter, Mrs. Potson.

1090
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,560
Why is she grounded?

1091
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,560
Afraid she'll run away before the wedding?

1092
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,560
No.

1093
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,560
She's as delighted as we are about the wedding.

1094
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,560
Every bit as delighted as we are.

1095
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,560
But she might be hit by a car or a fallen piano.

1096
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,560
Or who knows what?

1097
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,560
A fallen piano?

1098
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,560
Mr. Potson wants us all to be one happy family.

1099
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,560
And he doesn't want to risk anything happening at the last minute.

1100
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,560
You please let her out of her room, please.

1101
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,560
Not a chance, Steve.

1102
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,560
Mr. Potson wouldn't like it.

1103
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,560
If you'd like to see her, it's fine with me.

1104
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Go upstairs and turn right.

1105
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Now, excuse me.

1106
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:47,560
I'm trying to get ready for the bake sale.

1107
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,560
Mr. Potson.

1108
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,560
You mustn't be too hard on Mr. Potson, Steve.

1109
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,560
He's a disappointed man.

1110
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,560
No matter how many large admission forms he fills out,

1111
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,560
they keep turning him down.

1112
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,560
He has a new application in, though,

1113
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,560
so keep your fingers crossed.

1114
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,560
If he joins the lodge,

1115
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,560
you and Stephanie can have your wedding in the Chapel of Love

1116
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:13,560
rather than over at Moynihan's place.

1117
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,560
Mr. what?

1118
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:16,560
Moynihan?

1119
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,560
Mr. Moynihan runs the Wayward Hotel

1120
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,560
and the Shady Oaks Funeral Parlor.

1121
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,560
It's rumored he has connections with the lodge,

1122
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:26,560
but the order keeps that kind of thing safe.

1123
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,560
So Mr. Potson has tried to get him to put in a good word

1124
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,560
for his lodge application?

1125
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,560
But so far...

1126
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,560
Lodge?

1127
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,560
What can you tell me about the lodge?

1128
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:43,560
Just that they're exclusive and secretive.

1129
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,560
If you're curious, you ought to pick up a lodge application

1130
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,560
at the post office and take it over to the Sergeant at Arms.

1131
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,560
Isn't that a thought?

1132
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,560
Isn't that a thought?

1133
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,560
Forget Mr. Potson.

1134
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,560
If you became a member of the order,

1135
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,560
we could hold the wedding inside the lodge.

1136
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:07,560
My, wouldn't that be lovely?

1137
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,560
Okay.

1138
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,560
Tell me about this wedding.

1139
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,560
Wedding?

1140
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,560
Well, it's set for three weeks.

1141
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,560
We're holding it over at Shady Oaks,

1142
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,560
Mr. Moynihan's funeral parlor.

1143
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,560
Wedding in a funeral?

1144
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,560
It's not a very romantic place,

1145
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,560
but there's nowhere else to hold it.

1146
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,560
Thanks to Mr. Potson.

1147
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,560
You mustn't be too hard...

1148
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,560
Give my regards to your parents.

1149
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,560
Wait, wait, what if I say those words?

1150
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,560
Yes, please.

1151
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,560
She's upstairs.

1152
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,560
What if I say fuck again?

1153
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,560
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

1154
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,560
Shit.

1155
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,560
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

1156
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,560
Is that really, is that really,

1157
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,560
is mom the only one that responds to that?

1158
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,560
Icebox is locked.

1159
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,560
Our kitchen is a minty fresh looking scent.

1160
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,560
Pushes are preventing it from opening.

1161
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,560
A plastic plant with freshly watered soil,

1162
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,560
and with little styrofoam balls.

1163
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,560
Our kitchen has a minty fresh look.

1164
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,560
Minty fresh look, minty fresh look.

1165
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,560
Okay, got it.

1166
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,560
Upstairs we go then.

1167
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,560
Duck.

1168
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:38,560
A thin layer of hair coats

1169
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,560
virtually every inch of ceramic.

1170
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,560
Our duck has seen better days.

1171
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,560
He's purty.

1172
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,560
This window affords a spectacular view of aluminum siding.

1173
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,560
A picture on the wall is hanging a bit crooked.

1174
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,560
Ah!

1175
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,560
Medicine cabinet reeks of various toiletries.

1176
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,560
Can I grab tampons?

1177
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,560
Better ask Stephanie about those.

1178
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,560
You're here to roll the tube from the bottom.

1179
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,560
New zippy vitamins will pick you right up.

1180
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,560
Got a headache?

1181
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,560
This aspirin should do the trick.

1182
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,560
You are of extra strength or a lube.

1183
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,560
Great for getting in and out of tight spots.

1184
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,560
Give me that.

1185
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,560
One hour cough medicine.

1186
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,560
Give me that.

1187
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,560
Morning yeast disinfectant.

1188
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,560
Not to be used for baking cookies.

1189
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,560
Give me that.

1190
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,560
Give me that too.

1191
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,560
And those.

1192
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,560
Thanks.

1193
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,560
Plants.

1194
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,560
Fully yoded.

1195
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,560
I don't look around the room, sorry.

1196
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,560
Yes, nice taste.

1197
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,560
That's it?

1198
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,560
I guess I can talk to her?

1199
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,560
Who are you?

1200
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,560
What are you doing in my room?

1201
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,560
Haven't you heard?

1202
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,560
We're getting married.

1203
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,560
So, you're the one.

1204
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,560
Steve, isn't it?

1205
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,560
You mean, you don't know me?

1206
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,560
You don't know me?

1207
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,560
You don't know me?

1208
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,560
Yeah, what's going on?

1209
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,560
Those people?

1210
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,560
This actress and her VA are the same person.

1211
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,560
Oh, okay.

1212
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,560
Steve has a different one for some reason.

1213
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,560
Maybe his voice wasn't Steve enough.

1214
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,560
Alright, let's talk about those people.

1215
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,560
I know what you mean, I don't belong here.

1216
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,560
Dang it.

1217
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,560
Okay, fair.

1218
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,560
Yeah, I get it.

1219
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,560
Yeah, I understand.

1220
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,560
Both grounded.

1221
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,560
Okay, grounded.

1222
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,560
Have you seen or heard anything?

1223
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,560
Have you seen or heard anything?

1224
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:33,560
Anything else?

1225
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,560
Anything else?

1226
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,560
Huh?

1227
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,560
Did dad put that people in then?

1228
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,560
Mr. Potsdam?

1229
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,560
Escape.

1230
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,560
I think you're right.

1231
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:38,560
Harvest blood drive, huh?

1232
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,560
Alright, alright.

1233
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,560
Amnesia.

1234
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,560
Oh, does that mean bombs?

1235
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,560
I have had these recurring dreams.

1236
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,560
Just fragments, really.

1237
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,560
Strange, abstract images.

1238
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,560
Liquid, chrome.

1239
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:18,560
Chrome?

1240
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,560
Probably just a dream.

1241
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:22,560
Well, have you thought about how to escape harvest?

1242
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,560
Well, what's escape?

1243
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,560
Harvest is a pri-

1244
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,560
You're too eccentric.

1245
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,560
You haven't been locked in your room for a week.

1246
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,560
Okay, can I say fuck to her?

1247
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,560
You're not making sense.

1248
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:41,560
Never mind.

1249
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,560
Duty?

1250
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,560
Duty?

1251
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,560
You're not making sense.

1252
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,560
Okay, bye.

1253
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,560
Come back and visit me soon, okay?

1254
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,560
Okay.

1255
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,560
Damn, it must be boring.

1256
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,560
That rope looks about red meat

1257
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,560
and its importance to living well.

1258
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,560
These books are obviously fakes.

1259
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,560
Makeup looks just fine.

1260
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,560
A closet door won't budge.

1261
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,560
Okay, well.

1262
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,560
Here we go.

1263
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,560
Only with the mom is wild.

1264
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,560
Why is it only with the mommy?

1265
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,560
Peep.

1266
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,560
No.

1267
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:31,560
Peep.

1268
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,560
Bathroom?

1269
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,560
Oh.

1270
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,560
Ah!

1271
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,560
Two!

1272
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:07,560
Two!

1273
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,560
Three!

1274
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,560
Should I try all of them?

1275
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,560
Everyone's saying two.

1276
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,560
Okay, let's do two.

1277
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:24,560
Obviously Mrs. Pops to Mrs. B.

1278
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,560
Ruin his marriage?

1279
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,560
Kohai, did you save?

1280
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,560
I didn't save.

1281
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,560
When was the last time I saved before I brought the paper out?

1282
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,560
Okay, let's do two.

1283
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,560
Ah!

1284
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:56,560
Mrs. Potsdam has a little problem.

1285
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,560
I'll handle it myself.

1286
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,560
Thanks for calling this to my attention, Steve.

1287
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,560
Then you won't mind if I tell Stephanie about it?

1288
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,560
Now, there's no need to scare Stephanie with this business.

1289
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,560
I guess not.

1290
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,560
So long as you patch that hole.

1291
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,560
Well, I guess I could hang that picture somewhere else.

1292
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,560
I thought you had no idea where it was.

1293
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,560
Hall?

1294
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,560
Beg pardon?

1295
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,560
Hall?

1296
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,560
Even...

1297
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,560
Looks like the house's previous owner was a pervert!

1298
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,560
I thought you had no idea where it was.

1299
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:59,560
Hall?

1300
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,560
Beg pardon?

1301
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,560
You've got a peephole in the upstairs bathroom.

1302
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:05,560
It looks in on Stephanie's room.

1303
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,560
Well, I'll be darned.

1304
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:10,560
You've been spying on your daughter, haven't you?

1305
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,560
How dare you!

1306
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,560
I'm no peeping Tom.

1307
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,560
I had no idea that was there.

1308
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,560
Then you won't mind if I tell Stephanie about it?

1309
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:22,560
Now, there's no need to scare Stephanie with this business.

1310
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,560
I guess not.

1311
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,560
So long as you patch that hole.

1312
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,560
Well, I guess I could hang that picture somewhere else.

1313
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:32,560
I thought you had no idea where it was.

1314
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,560
We're telling Stephanie.

1315
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,560
Maybe I'll save.

1316
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,560
I'll save, but I'm telling Stephanie.

1317
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,560
I'm telling her!

1318
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,560
Okay, cool, but, uh, hole.

1319
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,560
They're spying on me?

1320
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,560
I'm afraid so.

1321
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,560
So, that's the scraping I hear every night.

1322
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,560
The picture sliding along the wall.

1323
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,560
Disgusting.

1324
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,560
I've got to get out of here, Steve.

1325
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:40,560
The thought of that fat slob.

1326
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,560
Watching me.

1327
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,560
I confronted Pott's stem about it.

1328
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,560
He tried to play dumb, but I got him to say he'd fix it.

1329
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,560
Thank you, Steve.

1330
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,560
I don't know what I'd do without you.

1331
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,560
Come back and visit me soon, okay?

1332
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,560
Make this save in slot two, okay?

1333
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,560
Sam pie.

1334
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,560
Hmm? Huh?

1335
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:56,560
You go ahead and fix that, right, Sam pie?

1336
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,560
You go ahead and fix that, right, Sam pie?

1337
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,560
Hmm.

1338
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,560
I played the fifth, but I see Azra's in yours.

1339
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,560
Why is mine not there too, Sam pie?

1340
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,560
Hmm?

1341
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,560
Mm-hmm.

1342
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:47,560
Yeah, I'm sure I'll hear the excuses.

1343
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:50,560
But it'll be the last excuse you ever make.

1344
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:54,560
Okay, Sam pie?

1345
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,560
It's a glitch and I can't see it.

1346
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,560
You think I'm blind, Sam pie?

1347
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,560
You think I'm blind, Sam pie?

1348
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,560
You think I can't fucking see?

1349
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,560
It's because I have an eye patch.

1350
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:16,560
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

1351
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,560
I can take it off right now and I can see perfectly fine.

1352
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,560
Sam pie?

1353
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,560
Huh?

1354
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:39,560
Please be lenient.

1355
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:48,560
I expect to see at least a broken heart if you're not allowed to put in scissors.

1356
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,560
Or maybe another heart.

1357
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,560
A full heart because that's what you're going to do, Sam pie,

1358
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:57,560
is that you're going to put my broken heart together

1359
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,560
and you're going to love me forever, right?

1360
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,560
Why would I wear one eye patch if I have two eyes?

1361
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,560
You didn't watch my debut?

1362
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,560
Sam pie?

1363
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,560
You didn't watch my debut?

1364
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,560
You should know if you watched my debut.

1365
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,560
Uh huh, uh huh.

1366
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,560
Well, Sam pie.

1367
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:47,560
I'm sure two of you can fit into one barrel, right?

1368
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:55,560
I'm sure two of you can fit into one barrel.

1369
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:06,560
If you don't, a bone saw will come in handy.

1370
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,560
Oh, you have amnesia.

1371
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:18,560
Do you just like Steve and Stephanie?

1372
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:21,560
But we're not in harvest here.

1373
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:29,560
We're not in harvest here, Sam pie.

1374
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:38,560
We are in harvest in the game, but you're in my basement.

1375
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,560
That's not harvest.

1376
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:47,560
Do you really love me, Sam pie?

1377
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,560
Say it.

1378
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,560
Say that you love me.

1379
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,560
Sam pie.

1380
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:59,560
Say that you love me.

1381
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:01,560
Right now.

1382
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,560
Say it.

1383
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,560
Say it!

1384
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,560
Hmm.

1385
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,560
Uh huh, uh huh.

1386
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,560
I didn't see all of you say you love me.

1387
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,560
Did you lie?

1388
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:53,560
Did you lie to me, Sam pie?

1389
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:55,560
Is that what you're saying?

1390
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:58,560
You're lying to me?

1391
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,560
Of course.

1392
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,560
No lies, right?

1393
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,560
You don't love me.

1394
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,560
Right?

1395
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,560
I love you, Sam pie.

1396
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:18,560
So make sure you don't make me mad again.

1397
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,560
Understood.

1398
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,560
Well, let's see what's going on here.

1399
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,560
Tave game.

1400
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,560
That...

1401
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:57,560
The attic window is the perfect nesting ground for wasps.

1402
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,560
I don't like wasps.

1403
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:02,560
Oh wait, I can go in?

1404
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,560
Oh wait, I can go in?

1405
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,560
These are all freaking wasps?

1406
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,560
The icebox is sealed shut.

1407
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,560
Shut with a wasp, man.

1408
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,560
The wasp woman.

1409
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,560
The Judeo-Christian rights of sacrifice

1410
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,560
and conventional taboos against unbridled pleasure

1411
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,560
for the prejudice against wasps.

1412
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,560
Do wasps make...

1413
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,560
Do wasps make honey?

1414
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,560
Do wasps make honey?

1415
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,560
I don't think wasps make honey.

1416
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,560
Okay.

1417
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,560
Honey?

1418
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:14,560
Okay, selling versus...

1419
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:32,560
It's not what is produced.

1420
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:36,560
So much as what is performed.

1421
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,560
I don't see any particular use for wasps.

1422
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:43,560
Why must everything have a use?

1423
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:48,560
Is there always the determining factor?

1424
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:53,560
More slender, more aerodynamic than the bee.

1425
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:57,560
The wasp is a joy to behold.

1426
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,560
Why is the wasp having the harvest logo?

1427
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:07,560
Ju-juicy?

1428
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,560
Ju-juicy?

1429
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:17,560
Juicy?

1430
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,560
Wasps?

1431
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:30,560
Wasps produce nothing for others,

1432
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,560
but only for themselves.

1433
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,560
Wasps spill nests and more wasps, nothing more.

1434
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:41,560
They spread into eons and addicts,

1435
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:44,560
not to make honey for supermarkets,

1436
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:48,560
but to buzz and rustle on their own paper,

1437
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,560
perpetuating their own agenda,

1438
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:54,560
growing stealthily,

1439
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:58,560
the most relentless of insects.

1440
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:03,560
Aren't those wasps also help pollinate things

1441
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:07,560
as of, like, even by accident?

1442
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:13,560
What are the drawbacks of wasps, ma'am?

1443
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:17,560
Well, as you can see,

1444
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:21,560
the little darlings do love to sting.

1445
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:25,560
Another source of prejudice for the masses,

1446
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,560
and another reason to love them.

1447
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,560
Bees are like animals,

1448
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,560
they sting only for a reason,

1449
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,560
for sacrifice.

1450
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,560
They have no conception of individual sensation

1451
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,560
of pleasure.

1452
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:47,560
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, pleasure?

1453
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,560
Yes.

1454
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,560
A great deal of pleasure.

1455
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:56,560
The wasp is an individual being,

1456
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,560
not a laborer,

1457
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,560
hedonistic instead of industrial.

1458
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:04,560
Someone needs to anger.

1459
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:08,560
In truth, they are easily swayed to ecstasy.

1460
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,560
They penetrate your throats,

1461
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:14,560
and the muscular contractions in their thorax,

1462
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,560
as they pump venom,

1463
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,560
could be likened to the muscular contractions

1464
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:22,560
of ejaculation,

1465
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,560
each painful welt,

1466
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,560
an act of love.

1467
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,560
I don't think that was for pleasure.

1468
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,560
I don't think that was for pleasure, just said.

1469
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,560
Sacrifice?

1470
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,560
It's audacity.

1471
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:49,560
This appeals to those raised worshipping of God,

1472
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:54,560
that demand sacrifice and atonement.

1473
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,560
But the wasp is promiscuous.

1474
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,560
Promiscuous?

1475
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:02,560
They are not as sympathetic to the masses,

1476
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,560
because they do die when they sting.

1477
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,560
They live to sting another day,

1478
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:13,560
and they take pleasure from it.

1479
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:19,560
They do?

1480
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:22,560
I don't know anything about,

1481
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,560
I don't know anything about wasp,

1482
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:28,560
to interject with this.

1483
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:29,560
Juicy?

1484
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:31,560
What did you mean by juicy?

1485
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:33,560
A triviality.

1486
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,560
Look.

1487
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,560
A triviality.

1488
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,560
Sting? Sting?

1489
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:45,560
A triviality.

1490
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,560
Um...

1491
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:50,560
Wasp girl?

1492
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,560
Stop talking about gen 2.

1493
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:58,560
But maybe I'll pass that idea on to mummy.

1494
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,560
Maybe.

1495
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,560
I guess wasp is...

1496
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,560
Okay, I guess all of you guys are turned on by wasp now.

1497
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,560
I guess senpais really love wasp now, right?

1498
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:14,560
That means senpais want me to trap them

1499
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,560
in a shed full of wasp, right?

1500
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,560
Please, no.

1501
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:35,560
I'll let them loose in the basement.

1502
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:37,560
Yeah, maybe I'll just stuff out of the basement,

1503
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:39,560
and I'll let them all loose.

1504
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,560
I'll collect all of them.

1505
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,560
If that's what you want.

1506
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,560
Wasp outfit?

1507
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,560
What?

1508
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,560
You want me to be like,

1509
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,560
I'm a sexy wasp.

1510
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:58,560
I'm a sexy wasp.

1511
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,560
Sexy wasp.

1512
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,560
So silly.

1513
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:08,560
Anything else?

1514
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,560
Yes.

1515
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,560
A great deal of each.

1516
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,560
Do you like bees?

1517
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,560
A triviality.

1518
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:31,560
Hive?

1519
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,560
A triviality.

1520
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,560
Fridge?

1521
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,560
Okay, maybe I'll do fridge.

1522
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,560
Fridge.

1523
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,560
Fridge.

1524
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,560
Fridge.

1525
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,560
A triviality.

1526
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,560
Um, lodge?

1527
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,560
Can I do the lodge?

1528
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,560
A triviality.

1529
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,560
Harvest?

1530
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,560
A triviality.

1531
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,560
Queen?

1532
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:06,560
A triviality.

1533
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,560
Try triviality?

1534
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:14,560
Triv.

1535
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,560
How do I spell triviality?

1536
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,560
Triv...

1537
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,560
Triviality.

1538
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,560
A triviality.

1539
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,560
She focuses on wasps only.

1540
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,560
Pollination.

1541
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,560
Pollination.

1542
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,560
A triviality.

1543
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,560
Wasp.

1544
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,560
A triviality.

1545
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,560
Wow, okay, never mind then, I guess. Bye!

1546
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,560
Anything else I can grab in here?

1547
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:50,560
From the sound of it, these cabinets are infested with wasps.

1548
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,560
A rather colorful picture

1549
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,560
of a wasp.

1550
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,560
A wasp nest.

1551
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,560
Okay.

1552
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,560
An old car is the perfect nesting ground

1553
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,560
for a wasp.

1554
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,560
Okay.

1555
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,560
A general store?

1556
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:22,560
What's this?

1557
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,560
Tapes and broken glass.

1558
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,560
Obviously a professional break-in.

1559
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,560
He's too busy working to notice you.

1560
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,560
Air-conditioned!

1561
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:38,560
Yum-creamed asparagus.

1562
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:40,560
Two for forty-nine.

1563
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,560
Zero forty-nine.

1564
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,560
Yum-creamed asparagus.

1565
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:46,560
No?

1566
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,560
Harvest bake sale this Friday

1567
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:50,560
in the school gym.

1568
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:02,560
What's this?

1569
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,560
Free copies made here.

1570
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,560
Okay.

1571
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,560
To add roaches and bits of

1572
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:10,560
agrid grit,

1573
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,560
coat the water coolers bone-dry

1574
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:14,560
reservoir.

1575
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,560
This empty barrel reeks

1576
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,560
of rotting meat.

1577
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,560
Who are you?

1578
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,560
Helps?

1579
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,560
Everybody says I'm a kidder.

1580
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,560
What do you mean, willies?

1581
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,560
Speak your woolly!

1582
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,560
Uh, yeah, please.

1583
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:18,560
Oh, what?

1584
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,560
Chef contains an odd

1585
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,560
item for sale.

1586
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,560
Orange?

1587
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,560
Tape?

1588
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:46,560
Wait, sorry.

1589
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:48,560
What was that?

1590
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,560
An adult magazine for twenty-five cents.

1591
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,560
You must pay Mrs. Phelps

1592
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:54,560
before you buy anything.

1593
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,560
A slightly used wrench.

1594
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,560
You must pay Mrs. Phelps

1595
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,560
before you buy anything.

1596
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:06,560
A cow is bleeding

1597
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,560
a robust coffee

1598
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:10,560
on these harvest blend coffee can labels.

1599
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,560
Cans of soup!

1600
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:14,560
Or possibly rat poison.

1601
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,560
Black electrical tape.

1602
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,560
You must pay Mrs. Phelps before you can buy anything.

1603
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,560
I don't have any money

1604
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,560
except to buy the Dirty magazine.

1605
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:30,560
Should I buy the

1606
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,560
the Dirty magazine

1607
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,560
zine senpai?

1608
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,560
I'm gonna use a wrench and tape for mercy.

1609
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,560
I have lots of those.

1610
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,560
Yes.

1611
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,560
Yeah, let's have, yeah, let's pay for it!

1612
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,560
Where's my items?

1613
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,560
There we go.

1614
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:54,560
My quarter.

1615
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,560
Here you go.

1616
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,560
Only thing a quarter will buy is an adult magazine.

1617
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:02,560
A girly magazine?

1618
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:04,560
Yeah!

1619
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,560
I've been in here ogling the girly magazines

1620
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:14,560
behind my counter.

1621
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,560
Darned if I'd sell him one though.

1622
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,560
I know his wife for heaven's sakes.

1623
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,560
Well, will you sell me one?

1624
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,560
I certainly will Steve.

1625
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,560
That kind of interest is healthy

1626
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,560
for a young fellow.

1627
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,560
Stares him away from being a

1628
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,560
fireman.

1629
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,560
What's wrong with the fireman?

1630
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:36,560
So am I getting it?

1631
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:38,560
I got it!

1632
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:40,560
Wait, let's save before we look at it.

1633
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:44,560
Let's save before we look at it,

1634
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,560
because I feel like if I don't say

1635
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,560
it's gonna do that weird thing again.

1636
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,560
Let me look at it!

1637
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,560
Can I look at it?

1638
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,560
Why? Why can't I look at it?

1639
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,560
I got it!

1640
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,560
I wanted to look at the girly magazine!

1641
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:22,560
I wanted to see the dirty magazines.

1642
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:24,560
The dirty magazines.

1643
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,560
I wanted to look at the dirty magazines.

1644
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,560
You're not allowed to look at the dirty

1645
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,560
You're not allowed to look at the dirty magazines.

1646
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,560
Senpai.

1647
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,560
But you can with me.

1648
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,560
We're just gonna have to imagine it.

1649
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:56,560
I can't even look at the paper.

1650
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:00,560
You're gonna read a dirty mag on stream?

1651
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,560
It's not, it's not bad

1652
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,560
if it's a part of a game.

1653
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,560
What about dirty magazines of you?

1654
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:14,560
Of me?

1655
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,560
I don't think there's any.

1656
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:18,560
But wouldn't that make you jealous, Senpai?

1657
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,560
I don't know.

1658
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:32,560
Although I didn't want to see it

1659
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,560
because I was like, oh what's in

1660
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,560
what's in the dirty magazine?

1661
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,560
Okay, well...

1662
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:42,560
Post office?

1663
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,560
When do they have signs?

1664
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,560
What's this, a crushed paper cup

1665
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,560
that you can't see?

1666
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,560
Blind woman's trying to read her mail.

1667
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,560
Mailboxes seem hardly

1668
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,560
hardly used.

1669
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:08,560
Yes?

1670
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:10,560
I need some help.

1671
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,560
Mr. Postmaster Boyle.

1672
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,560
What can I do for you today?

1673
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,560
Boyle?

1674
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,560
I'd like a lodge application.

1675
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:22,560
I'm sorry, youngster.

1676
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,560
We're out of applications right now.

1677
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:26,560
Come on.

1678
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,560
You must have one around here somewhere.

1679
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,560
Well, I do have the master,

1680
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,560
but you can't write on that.

1681
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,560
And I only make copies once a month

1682
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,560
on the button, regular as clockwork.

1683
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,560
Can I go...

1684
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,560
get one at the lodge instead?

1685
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:46,560
Afraid not, son.

1686
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,560
You can't get them anywhere but the post office.

1687
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,560
I'm sorry, you'll just have to come back in a month.

1688
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:52,560
Same as anyone else.

1689
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,560
And even then, I can't guarantee you'll get an application.

1690
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:56,560
The line is always long

1691
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:58,560
and they're never enough to go around.

1692
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,560
It's very important that I get in quickly.

1693
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:02,560
That's what they all say.

1694
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,560
Postmaster Boyle, I'll just die

1695
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:06,560
if I don't get into the lodge.

1696
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,560
Can't make an exception, young man.

1697
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:10,560
Just wouldn't be right.

1698
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,560
What?

1699
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:16,560
What's the zip code?

1700
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,560
Oh, zip code,

1701
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,560
map with the harvest dead center.

1702
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:26,560
I wonder if I can distract him three clocks

1703
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:28,560
three times.

1704
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,560
I wonder if I can distract him.

1705
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:38,560
Maybe give Fat Meatman

1706
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,560
the dirty magazine

1707
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,560
to get an application.

1708
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:44,560
He said something about the sheriff.

1709
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:46,560
So the hint was that the sheriff probably

1710
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,560
gets the magazine.

1711
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,560
That's what it said before.

1712
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,560
So I played enough

1713
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,560
pointing clicks to know

1714
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,560
that perhaps that is the reason.

1715
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:02,560
Maybe I can go to the barbershop?

1716
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,560
I always feel like

1717
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,560
before I need to go into a building

1718
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,560
I need to save.

1719
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:24,560
Maybe you can trade the magazine

1720
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,560
with the blind woman paper.

1721
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:28,560
Enough about the magazine.

1722
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:30,560
It's going to the chief sheriff.

1723
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,560
A fancy barber pole

1724
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:40,560
secured to the wall with straight

1725
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,560
shot screws.

1726
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,560
Why is there an alien up there?

1727
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:46,560
An unfortunate extraterrestrial

1728
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,560
who journeyed hundreds of lights years

1729
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:50,560
to wind up mounted to a barber's wall.

1730
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:54,560
Except for his occasional hairball cough

1731
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:56,560
it's hard to tell if the sheep is alive or not.

1732
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:00,560
Made of solidified moose

1733
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:02,560
and sticky hairspray.

1734
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:04,560
This lovely mannequin is a work of art.

1735
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:08,560
It takes a true sportsman to hunt down those dangerous

1736
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:10,560
dogs.

1737
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:12,560
A dangling television is sure to cause

1738
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:14,560
neck strain at this angle.

1739
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,560
Call

1740
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:22,560
call, call a note, call a note, Buster Monroe

1741
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,560
Colonel

1742
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,560
Colonel Colonel Colonel

1743
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,560
There you go.

1744
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,560
Colonel Buster Monroe flipping

1745
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,560
the bird from his B-17

1746
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:34,560
cockpit.

1747
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:36,560
That's a picture of Mr. Pastrilli

1748
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:38,560
as a young buck.

1749
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:43,560
Picture of a young Mr. Pastrilli spaghetti in his mouth and awe.

1750
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:45,560
Howdy Steve.

1751
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:48,560
Yeah. Howdy back, Mr.

1752
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:50,560
It swells, Steve.

1753
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:52,560
Don't disturb my old leg now.

1754
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:55,560
Change your mind about that aluminum siding.

1755
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:56,560
What are you talking about?

1756
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,560
What are you talking about?

1757
02:09:57,560 --> 02:10:00,560
I really think you should tuck your father into buying some.

1758
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,560
He can afford it.

1759
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:07,560
And I can't stress enough the value of some really fine aluminum siding.

1760
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:13,560
Keeps it warm in the summer, cool in the winter, and it keeps out the shade.

1761
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:15,560
Warm out in the summer and cool in the winter, huh?

1762
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:16,560
No, thank you.

1763
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:21,560
But I can't get him to understand a word I say.

1764
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:22,560
Aluminum siding.

1765
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:23,560
I didn't mean to click him.

1766
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:30,560
I meant to like click something else, but okay.

1767
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:32,560
Aluminum siding.

1768
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:37,560
Steve, aluminum siding can't get a fair shake no more.

1769
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:47,560
Started when those firemen came to harvest, filling people's heads with new fangled notions like color coordination and interior design.

1770
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:51,560
You can paint aluminum, you know, if you want to.

1771
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:55,560
But even so, I can't seem to move it anymore.

1772
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:59,560
Not even to a rouble like Pastrilli.

1773
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:04,560
Thank God for the plumbing.

1774
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:18,560
Are we implying that the firemen are a little...

1775
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:20,560
It's okay.

1776
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:22,560
I'll relate with the firemen.

1777
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:25,560
I love interior design and color coordination.

1778
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:29,560
After all, every time we go on dates, we have to be color coordinated.

1779
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:40,560
So everybody knows that we're a couple.

1780
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:43,560
We'll get along just fine.

1781
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:47,560
Maybe they can give some tips on more interior design.

1782
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:57,560
Maybe I can make the basement more welcoming for my supplies.

1783
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:59,560
Don't you think that'll be great?

1784
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:05,560
Maybe we can wear those like t-shirts that's like...

1785
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:11,560
That's like, I'm his and I'm hers.

1786
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:13,560
The matching collar was enough?

1787
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:16,560
No, we have to have like matching everything.

1788
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:19,560
That'd be cute.

1789
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:31,560
And matching and like promise rings.

1790
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:42,560
Oh, well, let's talk more about Pastrilli.

1791
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:45,560
Pastrilli's a rouble from way back.

1792
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:50,560
Ask Clam Parsons how we followed up with the alarm system in here.

1793
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,560
I'm a plumber.

1794
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:55,560
I could fix it for him, but he just won't listen.

1795
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:57,560
I mean...

1796
02:12:57,560 --> 02:13:02,560
Well, I've seen the end coming for the aluminum siding game,

1797
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:05,560
so I took a mail course and learned how to be a plumber.

1798
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:09,560
Now, there's a business that never lets up.

1799
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:12,560
You'd be surprised when people flush down the toilet.

1800
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:13,560
You know, fair.

1801
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:15,560
I always need...

1802
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:18,560
Sometimes I had to call a plumber,

1803
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:21,560
but then three plumbers ghosted me.

1804
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:27,560
And then Papa Mercy came to save the day and fixed it.

1805
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:30,560
We fixed it itself.

1806
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:32,560
We fixed it ourselves.

1807
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:36,560
I can't believe plumbers nowadays would just ghost you like that.

1808
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:40,560
Don't they want money?

1809
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:47,560
Don't they want money?

1810
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:49,560
I don't get it.

1811
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:51,560
I was willing to pay.

1812
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:53,560
But they always ghost.

1813
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:56,560
And I'm just like, why?

1814
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:05,560
So Papa was so sick of it, he just fixed it himself.

1815
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:07,560
Didn't you scare them away? Why would I?

1816
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:11,560
All I said was my shower stopped working.

1817
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:14,560
This is called Papa Modisse first time?

1818
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:20,560
Well, it was Papa Modisse idea to call the plumber first.

1819
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:24,560
And then once the first one...

1820
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:30,560
Once the first one ghosted,

1821
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:33,560
we're like, okay, maybe that one's just busy.

1822
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:35,560
We called a different one. We called another one.

1823
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:38,560
And then that didn't work.

1824
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:40,560
And so we called another one.

1825
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:42,560
And that didn't work.

1826
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:45,560
And like, well, the last one we called,

1827
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:48,560
we waited for like, odd day for him.

1828
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:50,560
And he was a no-show.

1829
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:52,560
He was a no-show.

1830
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:55,560
And then we called the place back and they were like,

1831
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:57,560
oh yeah, tomorrow.

1832
02:14:57,560 --> 02:15:00,560
And so we waited another day and he never showed.

1833
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:02,560
And we called back and they were like,

1834
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:05,560
oh yeah, yeah, maybe another day.

1835
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:07,560
And then we're like, you know what?

1836
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:09,560
Can we cancel that?

1837
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:18,560
And so after that, Papa was like,

1838
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:21,560
screw this, I'll do it myself.

1839
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:28,560
And then, and then...

1840
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:35,560
And then he did it himself and he did a great job.

1841
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:48,560
Gave you the window and then no-show?

1842
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:50,560
Yeah, like twice.

1843
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:52,560
All of them did.

1844
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:55,560
I just don't understand plumbers.

1845
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:57,560
Bye-bye.

1846
02:15:57,560 --> 02:16:00,560
Nice to see you again, Steve.

1847
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:05,560
Mr. Pastrilli does not respond, not understanding English.

1848
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:07,560
Wait, what?

1849
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:09,560
Is he Italian?

1850
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:11,560
Mamma mia!

1851
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:15,560
Hello there, youngster.

1852
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:18,560
They say them aliens I was telling you about,

1853
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:20,560
they came back last night,

1854
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:23,560
cut another crop circle in the Southfield.

1855
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:26,560
How come I never see none of them saw some plum?

1856
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:28,560
Them aliens is wild, they think.

1857
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,560
You don't cross the intergalactic void

1858
02:16:31,560 --> 02:16:33,560
without learning a trick or two.

1859
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:35,560
You know what Mr. Pastrilli did?

1860
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:38,560
Yesterday, he gets an alarm system to protect his pole.

1861
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:43,560
Only he don't know how to rig it, so now it's all arrived.

1862
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:45,560
Hmm.

1863
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,560
Yeah.

1864
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:53,560
Sometimes it's a job for YouTube tutorials

1865
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:55,560
and multiple chips to the hardware store.

1866
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:57,560
Actually, that's exactly what Papa did,

1867
02:16:57,560 --> 02:16:59,560
except for he didn't really...

1868
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:01,560
He doesn't know YouTube.

1869
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:03,560
Speaking of YouTube,

1870
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:06,560
guess what, Senpai, you all have been...

1871
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:11,560
You all have been, um...

1872
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:15,560
promoted from students to fans.

1873
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:19,560
Mama Mercy has figured out what a YouTuber is.

1874
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:22,560
We're making progress!

1875
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:25,560
Except for now, she's been trying to convince me

1876
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:28,560
to do tours of the local Costco.

1877
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:32,560
A film tour of the local Costco.

1878
02:17:41,560 --> 02:18:01,560
She's apparently been watching people do show off

1879
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:06,560
what's being bought at, like, what's new products from Costco.

1880
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:10,560
And so she's like, that seems really easy, dear.

1881
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:14,560
Except for now, we have another problem.

1882
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:18,560
We have another problem.

1883
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:22,560
Senpai, we have another problem.

1884
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:27,560
She's now wanting the play button faster.

1885
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:29,560
She wants it faster.

1886
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:33,560
She's like, yeah, you can get it now, right?

1887
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:36,560
I'm sure lots of people will watch.

1888
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:41,560
And now I'm worried.

1889
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:44,560
You think she's gonna find you at any point?

1890
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:46,560
Probably not.

1891
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:55,560
She watches cooking videos in Vietnamese.

1892
02:18:55,560 --> 02:19:01,560
She's watching cooking videos and Costco tours,

1893
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:08,560
or store tours, I guess, tours of shops and stuff.

1894
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:10,560
She's getting it!

1895
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:16,560
Not all of it, but she's getting it.

1896
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:19,560
When do we get a cooking stream with Kohai?

1897
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:23,560
To be honest, I'm a little clumsy.

1898
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:26,560
Mama, last time I tried to go in the kitchen,

1899
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:33,560
Mama said, get out.

1900
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:36,560
Don't worry, I'll try my best for you, Senpai.

1901
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:41,560
But last time she said...

1902
02:19:41,560 --> 02:19:45,560
She said, uh...

1903
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:55,560
I'm too clumsy to be in the kitchen.

1904
02:19:55,560 --> 02:20:02,560
Yeah!

1905
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:05,560
I mean, I don't blame her.

1906
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:10,560
You want to hear a funny story?

1907
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:17,560
So I was trying to cut strawberries with a fruit knife.

1908
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:21,560
And if you didn't know,

1909
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:27,560
fruit knives, the sharp part is not the curved part.

1910
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:32,560
The sharp part is the flat side.

1911
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:38,560
You can see where I'm getting at, right?

1912
02:20:38,560 --> 02:20:40,560
So I was cutting strawberries,

1913
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,560
and I was having trouble cutting the strawberries.

1914
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:47,560
And Mama looked at me and said,

1915
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:50,560
it's upside down.

1916
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:56,560
And you know what I did?

1917
02:20:56,560 --> 02:21:01,560
I flipped the strawberry and not the knife,

1918
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:11,560
and continued trying to cut it.

1919
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:36,560
I got it in the end when she grabbed the knife

1920
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:44,560
and put it down to the flat side instead.

1921
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:49,560
Well, I'm not used to fruit knives, you know?

1922
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:56,560
So I just assumed the sharp side was the curved side.

1923
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:58,560
How did you survive this long?

1924
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:03,560
I have no idea, to be honest.

1925
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:05,560
Like knife, you know?

1926
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:08,560
You're used to the curved side being the sharp part,

1927
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:10,560
but on a fruit knife it's not that part.

1928
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:20,560
But the flat end.

1929
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:26,560
So, which is why I was very confused.

1930
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:30,560
I was confused.

1931
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:32,560
And the bright side, we might get hurt less.

1932
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:37,560
What do you mean?

1933
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:41,560
What do you mean some pie?

1934
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:43,560
You should have just used scissors.

1935
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:47,560
But it was a really cute fruit knife.

1936
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:50,560
It was like, it was a cute color.

1937
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:52,560
It was like this kind of like reddish,

1938
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,560
orange fruit knife.

1939
02:22:54,560 --> 02:23:04,560
I got it at Ikea.

1940
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:07,560
With scissors it's really easy to remember the sharp side, right?

1941
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:09,560
Yeah, of course.

1942
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:14,560
It's easy.

1943
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:30,560
But I was unfamiliar with fruit knives game.

1944
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:32,560
I can make cakes and stuff too,

1945
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:38,560
but sometimes I spill a little bit of the flour,

1946
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:41,560
or I accidentally put too much butter in.

1947
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:44,560
Actually, the last time I made cookies,

1948
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:46,560
actually not the first time I made cookies.

1949
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,560
I wasn't cookies.

1950
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:51,560
Sorry, it was bread.

1951
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:53,560
First time I tried making bread.

1952
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:58,560
So, first time I tried making bread,

1953
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:09,560
I misread the...

1954
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:12,560
I didn't realize there was a difference

1955
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:19,560
between tablespoon and teaspoon.

1956
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:33,560
So, when I asked for 3 teaspoons of salt,

1957
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:37,560
I put in 3 tablespoons of salt.

1958
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:40,560
And let me just say, not even the birds wanted it.

1959
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:56,560
It's okay, I'll get better for you, Senpai.

1960
02:24:56,560 --> 02:25:09,560
I'll be a good wife, I promise.

1961
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:12,560
I think mom was right, maybe just a little bit.

1962
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:15,560
Well, she does have those memories fresh in her mind,

1963
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:16,560
so that's why she's like,

1964
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,560
if I go into the kitchen and I'm like,

1965
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:19,560
I want to make this, she's like,

1966
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:25,560
stop, I'll make it for you.

1967
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:36,560
What do you mean you don't want to marry me?

1968
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:44,560
What do you mean you don't want to marry me, Senpai?

1969
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:52,560
Mazodia obliterate!

1970
02:25:52,560 --> 02:26:01,560
That was mean Senpai, you shouldn't say things like that.

1971
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:13,560
He shouldn't say things like that.

1972
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:19,560
I'm trying my best to be a good wife.

1973
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:26,560
Anyways, let's continue.

1974
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:28,560
Paul, what do you mean the Paul?

1975
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:31,560
What Barber fully is, is his pride and joy.

1976
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:33,560
Brought it all the way over from Italy.

1977
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:35,560
Wrapped off special-like.

1978
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:36,560
Wrapped off special-like?

1979
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:38,560
It ain't no but colored glass,

1980
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,560
with some bulbs just stuck up in it.

1981
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:43,560
He thinks it's to be all in, doll.

1982
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:46,560
Install that alarm system just to protect it.

1983
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:48,560
Though who in Tarnation

1984
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:50,560
would want to steal a worthless piece of junk like that?

1985
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:51,560
I don't know.

1986
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:53,560
Maybe them aliens, Clem.

1987
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:54,560
Oh, the aliens?

1988
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:56,560
Oh, Pete, don't be ignorant.

1989
02:26:56,560 --> 02:27:00,560
Aliens don't give a fig for no colored glass.

1990
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:02,560
You think if they can build spaceships,

1991
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:04,560
they can't make a bad-gum barber pole?

1992
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:05,560
Well, maybe.

1993
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:18,560
They don't know nothing about science.

1994
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:20,560
Can we get a pole in the basement?

1995
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:22,560
It'll be nice to watch when Kauai is in here.

1996
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:25,560
But Senpai,

1997
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:28,560
give you the television on all the time,

1998
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:31,560
with all of my VHSs.

1999
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:34,560
You can watch anything you want.

2000
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:45,560
I highly recommend the Digimon the first movie.

2001
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:46,560
We get a TV.

2002
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:49,560
Yeah, very small one.

2003
02:27:49,560 --> 02:27:53,560
Everyone gets to watch it.

2004
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:59,560
Can I watch Berserk?

2005
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:01,560
Only the first one, okay?

2006
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:02,560
Any following...

2007
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:03,560
Any...

2008
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:04,560
And definitely not the 3D one,

2009
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:11,560
or the following ones, okay?

2010
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:15,560
No!

2011
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:22,560
Excuse me.

2012
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:26,560
Pastirelli shelled out for an alarm system all right,

2013
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:29,560
but he's too cheap to hire an electrician to hook her up.

2014
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:32,560
Dang, Egypt cross-wired it through the fire sprinkler.

2015
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:34,560
So now when the alarm goes off,

2016
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:36,560
it sets the sprinkler spraying.

2017
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:37,560
Coronation.

2018
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:39,560
Aliens looking for intelligent life

2019
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:43,560
ought to stay away from this shop, sure enough.

2020
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:44,560
Hmm.

2021
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:51,560
Is that the hint for the firefighters, perhaps?

2022
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:56,560
Wait, do you actually like Digimon,

2023
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:59,560
or was that a meme?

2024
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:01,560
Every birthday senpai.

2025
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:05,560
I rewatched the Digimon movie.

2026
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:15,560
On the VHS it has the Angela Anaconda shorts in front of it.

2027
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:24,560
Hmm, that one.

2028
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:33,560
I watch the one that has like 3 movies attached into it.

2029
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:36,560
I watch it for my birthday all the time.

2030
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:37,560
Every year.

2031
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:48,560
It's like tradition now.

2032
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:52,560
And then, I don't know if all versions have this one,

2033
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:56,560
but at the end they have kids of America music video,

2034
02:29:56,560 --> 02:30:10,560
like a flash music video.

2035
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:12,560
Are you gonna watch it together?

2036
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:15,560
I only have it on VHS, so I don't know.

2037
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:17,560
I don't know if I...

2038
02:30:17,560 --> 02:30:25,560
I don't know how to share VHS.

2039
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:27,560
Hmm, that's the one I have.

2040
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:33,560
I also have like a variety of Pokemon movies too.

2041
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:36,560
My first gift from Mama...

2042
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:39,560
Well, first gift that I can remember from Mama and Papa

2043
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:52,560
was Pokemon the first movie.

2044
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:54,560
Well, let's talk about aliens.

2045
02:30:54,560 --> 02:31:00,560
Well, son, the ways of the alien is a specialized area of woodcraft,

2046
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:04,560
the known to all but the wily of sportsmen.

2047
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:09,560
What you gotta remember is your average alien is smarter than your average human,

2048
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:13,560
so you gotta be extra careful building your blind if you want a bag one.

2049
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:15,560
You hunt aliens?

2050
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:20,560
Son, after nailing an alien, you can never go back to quails.

2051
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:21,560
Nailing?

2052
02:31:21,560 --> 02:31:27,560
You can get one of those and just swap me.

2053
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:31,560
Line your blind with lead to fool their sensing machines.

2054
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:33,560
Lay real quiet and wait.

2055
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:36,560
Preferably in the woods around the nuclear base.

2056
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:38,560
Oh, they love messing around out there.

2057
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:41,560
Why not wait outside your field, clan?

2058
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:44,560
Wait for them to come a-carving.

2059
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:47,560
Oh, they do their crop doodles with zap guns, you dirty fool.

2060
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:48,560
Don't you know nothing?

2061
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:49,560
Don't you know nothing?

2062
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:52,560
There's no place to put the blind out in the field.

2063
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:56,560
Now you listen to Clem Parsons if you want to tag in a nursery being.

2064
02:31:56,560 --> 02:32:01,560
They cross the void, wondering what lies beyond,

2065
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:07,560
all the time not knowing if what awaits them is bookshot.

2066
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:22,560
Do you guys remember when the U.S. government said aliens were real?

2067
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:27,560
That was a few months ago, but everyone forgot that they said it before.

2068
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:32,560
Like during COVID?

2069
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:44,560
So I feel like everyone's like,

2070
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:45,560
Aliens are real?

2071
02:32:45,560 --> 02:32:47,560
Didn't they say that already?

2072
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:52,560
Oh, there's aliens.

2073
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:54,560
And now I'm like, oh, okay.

2074
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:03,560
They said it before, and then after that,

2075
02:33:03,560 --> 02:33:05,560
and then after that they announced it again,

2076
02:33:05,560 --> 02:33:07,560
and everyone's like, oh gosh, aliens.

2077
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:12,560
And I'm like, no, I'm pretty sure they have announced this before.

2078
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:14,560
I thought it was just UFOs the first time.

2079
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:16,560
Isn't that still alien-ish?

2080
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:32,560
Oh wow, I totally believe it.

2081
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:35,560
I totally believe it, Senpai.

2082
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,560
Why?

2083
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:42,560
Because maybe we can get married in space.

2084
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:49,560
We can get married in space.

2085
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:53,560
I think that'll be nice.

2086
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:02,560
Did we talk about Pastor Ali again?

2087
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:14,560
Alarm system.

2088
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:18,560
Okay, bye.

2089
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:23,560
Okay, that's a good hint that the alarm system

2090
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:26,560
is connected to the fire alarm.

2091
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:28,560
So when that happens...

2092
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:40,560
Let's go to the lodge first.

2093
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:43,560
The heck is that?

2094
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:48,560
Red eyes gleam with eerie malevolence from the darkness.

2095
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:49,560
What the heck is that?

2096
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:02,560
Your voice is really deep.

2097
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:09,560
Your mind touched me, huh?

2098
02:35:13,560 --> 02:35:16,560
Your excitement warmed my attention.

2099
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:20,560
Do you hunger for true knowledge?

2100
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:25,560
Speaking of...

2101
02:35:27,560 --> 02:35:29,560
This is Steve's voice actor.

2102
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:31,560
I can do this too.

2103
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:37,560
Do you hunger for true knowledge?

2104
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:43,560
Anyways, Senpai, did you know that I'm always touching you too?

2105
02:35:53,560 --> 02:35:54,560
Did you know that?

2106
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:02,560
Because every time you hear my voice,

2107
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:06,560
the bones in your ear is touching.

2108
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:10,560
Which makes the vibrations for you to hear sound.

2109
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:14,560
So therefore, I'm always touching you when you hear my voice.

2110
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:25,560
Isn't that amazing?

2111
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:26,560
Isn't that amazing?

2112
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:32,560
Always think about that.

2113
02:36:43,560 --> 02:36:45,560
I'm always touching you, Senpai.

2114
02:36:55,560 --> 02:36:57,560
I'm always touching you, Senpai.

2115
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:08,560
Anyways, yeah, I wanna join the lodge.

2116
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:15,560
Okay.

2117
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:18,560
Paper work? Okay, give me an application, then.

2118
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:57,560
Well, I can't believe the lodge has bureaucracy.

2119
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:03,560
Okay.

2120
02:38:12,560 --> 02:38:13,560
Fine, I'll get it.

2121
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:20,560
Man, why do they always cemetery shady oaks?

2122
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:23,560
Can I go down here? Fire station, police station.

2123
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:26,560
Meat plant.

2124
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:31,560
I'll stop this.

2125
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:32,560
How'd I convince him?

2126
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:34,560
Maybe I can get a clue.

2127
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:50,560
Hmm.

2128
02:38:58,560 --> 02:38:59,560
Hmm.

2129
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:02,560
What should I do?

2130
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:05,560
Big sale, big sale.

2131
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:08,560
What should I do?

2132
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:11,560
Hmm.

2133
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:14,560
It hasn't exactly said anything yet.

2134
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:18,560
I don't think, yeah, I don't think I can convince him just yet.

2135
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:21,560
Missile base.

2136
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:40,560
Why is he doing yoga or does he have no legs?

2137
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:48,560
Oddly enough, this guard booth is the only building in the base.

2138
02:40:01,560 --> 02:40:02,560
Section 21?

2139
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:07,560
Okay.

2140
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:18,560
Is there anyone being drafted right now?

2141
02:40:26,560 --> 02:40:27,560
Buster?

2142
02:40:35,560 --> 02:40:36,560
Pink?

2143
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:39,560
What's wrong with pink? I love pink.

2144
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:52,560
Wait, are we still in the Cold War?

2145
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:56,560
Are we still in the Cold War?

2146
02:41:05,560 --> 02:41:06,560
Okay.

2147
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:11,560
That's right.

2148
02:41:11,560 --> 02:41:14,560
Been in charge here since WW2.

2149
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:17,560
But I got my lower torso showing up.

2150
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:18,560
No, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2151
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:19,560
You're not doing yoga.

2152
02:41:19,560 --> 02:41:23,560
Those panty wastes in Washington wanted to stick me behind a desk.

2153
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:24,560
To hell with that.

2154
02:41:24,560 --> 02:41:25,560
They owed me.

2155
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:28,560
I left my legs in Düsseldorf.

2156
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:30,560
They owed me.

2157
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:36,560
Of course they felt that after the trauma of having to crawl from Germany to England,

2158
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:38,560
trailing my intestines behind me.

2159
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:42,560
It was too emotionally unstable to continue in the military.

2160
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:43,560
Fair.

2161
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:48,560
That's why they gave me this nice cushy job and put me in charge of the nuclear missiles.

2162
02:41:51,560 --> 02:41:52,560
Can I talk?

2163
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:53,560
The button?

2164
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:55,560
Why are you asking about the button, son?

2165
02:41:55,560 --> 02:41:57,560
I'm just a little nervous about it.

2166
02:41:57,560 --> 02:42:00,560
I mean, suppose an accident happens.

2167
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:03,560
Don't get your panties in a bunch, mister.

2168
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:06,560
The button is perfectly safe.

2169
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:09,560
I keep it on my person all the time.

2170
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:11,560
Is that a hint?

2171
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:15,560
No commie bastard is getting his mitts on this button.

2172
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:17,560
No, sorry, Bob.

2173
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:22,560
No one initiates a nuclear holocaust and harvest except me.

2174
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:25,560
Doesn't that make you feel better?

2175
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:26,560
Yeah?

2176
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:30,560
Harvest?

2177
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:32,560
Harvest is a fine town.

2178
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:35,560
Steeped in traditional American values.

2179
02:42:35,560 --> 02:42:37,560
But that lodge...

2180
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:39,560
Well, it makes me suspicious.

2181
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:41,560
Don't mind saying it.

2182
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:44,560
They've got their fingers into everything around here.

2183
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:49,560
Like a certain red commie bastard, Menace, which will be nameless.

2184
02:42:52,560 --> 02:42:54,560
Ow, stay away from the lodge.

2185
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:56,560
You read me wrong, mister.

2186
02:42:56,560 --> 02:42:59,560
I think you should join the lodge, infiltrate it,

2187
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:02,560
and report back on any red sympathizers.

2188
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:03,560
Okay, I'll do that.

2189
02:43:03,560 --> 02:43:07,560
That would affect my decision on what I've got to do.

2190
02:43:09,560 --> 02:43:11,560
Okay, commie bastard.

2191
02:43:11,560 --> 02:43:15,560
Frankly, all these questions are making me a little suspicious of you.

2192
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:18,560
Maybe you're one of those pink-blooded Americans.

2193
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:19,560
What's pink-blooded?

2194
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:23,560
Can you give me any reason why I shouldn't shoot you right now?

2195
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:28,560
No, not really.

2196
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:32,560
I appreciate your honesty, comrade.

2197
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:33,560
Eh?

2198
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:35,560
Eh?

2199
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:40,560
Eh?

2200
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:56,560
Okay.

2201
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:10,560
What did I do?

2202
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:12,560
I just caused nuclear!

2203
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:14,560
I caused a holocaust?

2204
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:21,560
What's pink anyways?

2205
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:33,560
What about...?

2206
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:39,560
They've got lower torso.

2207
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:04,560
I think it was a slang for American with communist sympathies.

2208
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:05,560
Okay!

2209
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,560
It's okay.

2210
02:46:03,560 --> 02:46:04,560
Hi.

2211
02:46:07,560 --> 02:46:08,560
Okay.

2212
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:13,560
Where's the exit?

2213
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:23,560
Can I ask him some more questions?

2214
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:25,560
Or is that it?

2215
02:46:25,560 --> 02:46:28,560
Does he give any necessary hints?

2216
02:46:33,560 --> 02:46:36,560
Okay, I'll ask some more.

2217
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:44,560
Lamas?

2218
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:47,560
Lamas?

2219
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:52,560
Is that a yes or a no?

2220
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:04,560
Uh...

2221
02:47:05,560 --> 02:47:06,560
What, Lamas?

2222
02:47:07,560 --> 02:47:08,560
No?

2223
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:34,560
Okay.

2224
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:40,560
I guess I gotta infiltrate the fire...

2225
02:47:41,560 --> 02:47:42,560
department.

2226
02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:56,560
Oh.

2227
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:03,560
Fair.

2228
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:07,560
Fair, fair.

2229
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:08,560
Very fair.

2230
02:48:10,560 --> 02:48:11,560
Oh, art!

2231
02:48:11,560 --> 02:48:12,560
Ooh, doggy!

2232
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:15,560
saliva is foaming from his...

2233
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:17,560
from his barking chops.

2234
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:21,560
Decorative Oriental fans from Ming Dynasty.

2235
02:48:21,560 --> 02:48:25,560
A picture of phallic-like structure standing in a roll.

2236
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:27,560
Compressionist landscape.

2237
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:31,560
Picture of a storybook fairy castle.

2238
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:34,560
Don't bother me, I'm sketching.

2239
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:36,560
Oh, look what you made me do!

2240
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:39,560
Hello, Steve!

2241
02:48:39,560 --> 02:48:42,560
Welcome to the House of Flame, as we like to call it.

2242
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:44,560
Oh, cut it out, Spots.

2243
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:45,560
Honestly.

2244
02:48:45,560 --> 02:48:47,560
Once it gets barking, a good piece of meat

2245
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:49,560
is the only way to shut him up.

2246
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:54,560
There you go, Spots.

2247
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:55,560
There you go, Spots.

2248
02:48:55,560 --> 02:48:56,560
Aw.

2249
02:49:10,560 --> 02:49:12,560
It's nice to meet you, Sparky!

2250
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:17,560
Oh my god, I just love your outfit!

2251
02:49:21,560 --> 02:49:22,560
I respect them.

2252
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:23,560
I respect them.

2253
02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:29,560
Why did you hear about my memory loss?

2254
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:38,560
Oh, another kidder, huh?

2255
02:49:51,560 --> 02:49:52,560
Such as...

2256
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:53,560
Such as?

2257
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:00,560
Mom, huh?

2258
02:50:17,560 --> 02:50:19,560
That sounds fantastic!

2259
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:22,560
Don't be such a party group, Steve.

2260
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:24,560
We're talking about art.

2261
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:26,560
We're talking about art here, okay?

2262
02:50:26,560 --> 02:50:28,560
We haven't had a flowery heart

2263
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:31,560
since the newspaper building burned down.

2264
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:33,560
So I'll admit that the wasp woman's place

2265
02:50:33,560 --> 02:50:36,560
is one big accident waiting to happen.

2266
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:38,560
Isn't that right, Spots?

2267
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:40,560
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.

2268
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:42,560
Yeah, that place is a safety hazard.

2269
02:50:45,560 --> 02:50:48,560
Oh well, let's talk about art.

2270
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:50,560
Love art.

2271
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:52,560
It does!

2272
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:10,560
Provocative, you say?

2273
02:51:15,560 --> 02:51:17,560
You're right, it is beneath me.

2274
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:21,560
Hey, newspaper fire.

2275
02:51:21,560 --> 02:51:23,560
A dreadful affair.

2276
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:25,560
You wouldn't think that a brick-and-steel building

2277
02:51:25,560 --> 02:51:28,560
with a sprinkler system could go up that quickly.

2278
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:30,560
You're right.

2279
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:35,560
You think it was arson?

2280
02:51:35,560 --> 02:51:37,560
Oh, please.

2281
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:39,560
Dwayne was glad enough.

2282
02:51:39,560 --> 02:51:41,560
You're right.

2283
02:51:41,560 --> 02:51:42,560
You're right.

2284
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:43,560
You're right.

2285
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:44,560
You're right.

2286
02:51:44,560 --> 02:51:45,560
You're right.

2287
02:51:45,560 --> 02:51:46,560
You're right.

2288
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:47,560
Please.

2289
02:51:47,560 --> 02:51:50,560
Dwayne was glad enough to see the thing go up.

2290
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:52,560
And so was McKnight.

2291
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:56,560
If you could get into that safe in his wall...

2292
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:58,560
Oh, get it.

2293
02:51:58,560 --> 02:51:59,560
I know.

2294
02:51:59,560 --> 02:52:02,560
As far as I know, the fire was an accident.

2295
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:04,560
Let's just leave it at that.

2296
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:06,560
So it wasn't an accident.

2297
02:52:06,560 --> 02:52:08,560
How don't you go moving?

2298
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:12,560
Hey, wasp woman?

2299
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:15,560
Some people think all we do is sit around

2300
02:52:15,560 --> 02:52:19,560
sketching betting examples of manhood for our own amusement.

2301
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:22,560
Nothing could be further from the truth.

2302
02:52:22,560 --> 02:52:24,560
Why, just the other day,

2303
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:28,560
we decided to take a crumb for firecoat violations.

2304
02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:31,560
All the dried-up paper-walked nests

2305
02:52:31,560 --> 02:52:33,560
clustered around our wooden house.

2306
02:52:33,560 --> 02:52:36,560
Why, it's a kenlog just waiting for the right faggot.

2307
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:37,560
Ah!

2308
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:40,560
Believe me, none of us wants to see another fiasco

2309
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:42,560
like the Sentinel fire.

2310
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:47,560
Bye-bye.

2311
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:50,560
Can't talk now, Steve, I'm inspired.

2312
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:54,560
Bye-bye.

2313
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:57,560
I don't converse on the job, Steve.

2314
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:13,560
YouTube!

2315
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:17,560
YouTube, this is a part of the game.

2316
02:53:17,560 --> 02:53:19,560
It's just a different time.

2317
02:53:19,560 --> 02:53:21,560
We understand respectfully that this,

2318
02:53:21,560 --> 02:53:24,560
that, that, um,

2319
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:27,560
that these are outdated terms.

2320
02:53:27,560 --> 02:53:29,560
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

2321
02:53:33,560 --> 02:53:35,560
Can't talk now.

2322
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:37,560
Bye-bye.

2323
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:40,560
I don't con-

2324
02:53:40,560 --> 02:53:43,560
Stop it, you're messing me up!

2325
02:53:47,560 --> 02:53:50,560
Wait, is there a fireplace in there?

2326
02:53:53,560 --> 02:53:56,560
Actually, just waiting to happen.

2327
02:53:57,560 --> 02:54:01,560
I like that the fire thingy is pink.

2328
02:54:01,560 --> 02:54:05,560
Oh, wait, wait, no, I can ask about communism, right?

2329
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:09,560
Can't talk now, Steve.

2330
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:14,560
Communism, do I spell it right?

2331
02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:16,560
Come again?

2332
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:18,560
Are you, uh...

2333
02:54:19,560 --> 02:54:21,560
Come again?

2334
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:23,560
Pink?

2335
02:54:23,560 --> 02:54:25,560
Come again?

2336
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:28,560
L-la-launch?

2337
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:31,560
Come again?

2338
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:33,560
Okay, bye.

2339
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:35,560
Bye-bye.

2340
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:39,560
I guess that's fine.

2341
02:54:51,560 --> 02:54:53,560
Newspaper building.

2342
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:59,560
What's left at the newspaper building after an extreme fire?

2343
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:03,560
Chevrolet's sticking out of the building's ashes.

2344
02:55:03,560 --> 02:55:05,560
Can I grab it?

2345
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:07,560
I want it, I want it!

2346
02:55:07,560 --> 02:55:09,560
Yeah.

2347
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:14,560
At least the plumbing held up.

2348
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:16,560
That's good plumbing.

2349
02:55:24,560 --> 02:55:27,560
What about police station?

2350
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:34,560
The cop ignores you, you're too busy writing a bug report.

2351
02:55:41,560 --> 02:55:44,560
The pot hisses at you from its perch.

2352
02:55:44,560 --> 02:55:47,560
Hmm, a map of harvest.

2353
02:55:51,560 --> 02:55:54,560
Hello, Steve. Let me introduce myself.

2354
02:55:54,560 --> 02:55:56,560
I'm Sheriff Dwayne Dwayne.

2355
02:55:56,560 --> 02:55:58,560
D-Dwayne Dwayne, huh?

2356
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:00,560
Pleasure, I reckon.

2357
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:03,560
Then, we haven't met before?

2358
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:05,560
Of course we have.

2359
02:56:05,560 --> 02:56:08,560
But I heard about your alleged amnesia and figured I'd play along.

2360
02:56:08,560 --> 02:56:11,560
I sure hope this is just a prank.

2361
02:56:11,560 --> 02:56:14,560
And not the start of some insanity play.

2362
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:17,560
Keep your nose clean or you'll wind up in jail.

2363
02:56:17,560 --> 02:56:20,560
And that's no place to hold a wedding.

2364
02:56:20,560 --> 02:56:22,560
Alright, amnesia.

2365
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:26,560
Why do you want to break your poor mama's heart with all this amnesia bug?

2366
02:56:26,560 --> 02:56:28,560
I'm telling you the truth.

2367
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:31,560
Oh geez, Steve, calm down.

2368
02:56:31,560 --> 02:56:33,560
You've always been a kidder, Steve.

2369
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:35,560
Kidder count!

2370
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:39,560
Boy, you need to stop all this funning and get serious.

2371
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:41,560
You've got a wedding coming up soon.

2372
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:44,560
Heck, you should be thinking about your career

2373
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:47,560
and about joining the lodge.

2374
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:49,560
Wedding.

2375
02:56:49,560 --> 02:56:51,560
Amnesia or no.

2376
02:56:51,560 --> 02:56:55,560
You can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing at harvest.

2377
02:56:55,560 --> 02:56:59,560
I think you and Stephanie are perfect for each other.

2378
02:56:59,560 --> 02:57:03,560
I just hope her father's disappointment doesn't spoil everything.

2379
02:57:03,560 --> 02:57:04,560
Disappointment?

2380
02:57:04,560 --> 02:57:05,560
Disappointment?

2381
02:57:05,560 --> 02:57:08,560
Mr. Potsdam wants to hold the wedding in the lodge.

2382
02:57:08,560 --> 02:57:10,560
But he'll never get in.

2383
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:15,560
Like all the rest, he's always hanging around the post office the first day of the month.

2384
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:19,560
Waiting for Boyle to bring out that much lodge applications.

2385
02:57:19,560 --> 02:57:21,560
There's always a long line.

2386
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:24,560
Never enough applications to go around.

2387
02:57:24,560 --> 02:57:29,560
And even if you do get an application, chances are you're right out of luck.

2388
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:33,560
If you recall to the order and even less accepted.

2389
02:57:33,560 --> 02:57:34,560
And Potsdam?

2390
02:57:34,560 --> 02:57:38,560
Well, they've turned him down so many times.

2391
02:57:38,560 --> 02:57:42,560
Unless he does something radical, he'll never get in.

2392
02:57:43,560 --> 02:57:45,560
Okay, let's check crime.

2393
02:57:45,560 --> 02:57:49,560
Crime wise, nothing much has happened in harvest since the newspaper fire.

2394
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:50,560
Oh, sure.

2395
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:54,560
Every week or so, we get the odd transient dropping dead.

2396
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:57,560
But other than that, it gets...

2397
02:57:57,560 --> 02:57:59,560
Every old, huh?

2398
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:05,560
Pertiest!

2399
02:58:09,560 --> 02:58:11,560
Good night and got a road trip tomorrow.

2400
02:58:11,560 --> 02:58:12,560
Need some sleep.

2401
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:13,560
Good night.

2402
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:14,560
Good luck on your road trip.

2403
02:58:14,560 --> 02:58:16,560
I don't remember anything.

2404
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:26,560
I don't remember anything.

2405
02:58:32,560 --> 02:58:33,560
Kitter count.

2406
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:39,560
Who's the perp?

2407
02:58:39,560 --> 02:58:42,560
We found the gas can that was used.

2408
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:44,560
Yes, sorry, Bob.

2409
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:47,560
It's in the evidence room.

2410
02:58:47,560 --> 02:58:50,560
That's classified, darn it.

2411
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:55,560
How many times are you gonna have to tell me to keep my mouth shut?

2412
02:58:55,560 --> 02:58:56,560
I wonder.

2413
02:58:56,560 --> 02:58:58,560
Sorry, boss.

2414
02:58:58,560 --> 02:59:00,560
It's okay there, partner.

2415
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:14,560
Who can make out all those curvy lines anyhow?

2416
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:17,560
No, it's sitting in there gathering dust.

2417
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:19,560
Clean is the day we found it.

2418
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:22,560
Just in case I ever need a spare gas can.

2419
02:59:22,560 --> 02:59:25,560
Huh, okay, they don't do their job well.

2420
02:59:28,560 --> 02:59:30,560
I'm sorry, let me try that again.

2421
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:32,560
Ah, chocks.

2422
02:59:32,560 --> 02:59:34,560
They don't do their job well.

2423
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:41,560
Dang it, and tell me about my amnesia.

2424
02:59:41,560 --> 02:59:46,560
Why do you want to break your poor mama's heart with all this amnesia bunk?

2425
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:48,560
I'm telling you the truth.

2426
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:49,560
Okay, got it.

2427
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:50,560
Yeah.

2428
02:59:50,560 --> 02:59:52,560
Boy, you need to stop all.

2429
02:59:53,560 --> 02:59:55,560
Why about my win?

2430
02:59:55,560 --> 02:59:59,560
You can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing.

2431
02:59:59,560 --> 03:00:00,560
Right.

2432
03:00:00,560 --> 03:00:01,560
Mr. Potts.

2433
03:00:05,560 --> 03:00:07,560
What about the Lodge?

2434
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:09,560
I don't mind telling you.

2435
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:12,560
I'd never get anything done if not for the Lodge's efforts.

2436
03:00:12,560 --> 03:00:18,560
To join the order of the harvest moon is the highest dream of everyone in harvest.

2437
03:00:23,560 --> 03:00:25,560
I'm gonna get an application.

2438
03:00:25,560 --> 03:00:32,560
And like I said, unless you get an application on the first day of the month, you're generally out of luck.

2439
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:33,560
Okay, bye.

2440
03:00:33,560 --> 03:00:35,560
Stop on by any time, Steve.

2441
03:00:35,560 --> 03:00:37,560
Can I go into the evidence room?

2442
03:00:37,560 --> 03:00:39,560
Door is locked.

2443
03:00:39,560 --> 03:00:40,560
Door is locked.

2444
03:00:40,560 --> 03:00:42,560
That's the evidence room.

2445
03:00:42,560 --> 03:00:45,560
Where we store items lifted from crime scenes.

2446
03:00:45,560 --> 03:00:48,560
It's kept locked at all times.

2447
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:53,560
There's things in there that could make people jump through hoops, if I wanted.

2448
03:00:53,560 --> 03:00:59,560
Oh, you're not only lazy here, but you're also corrupt.

2449
03:00:59,560 --> 03:01:00,560
Solve cases.

2450
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:02,560
Solve cases.

2451
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:04,560
Unsolved.

2452
03:01:04,560 --> 03:01:06,560
Unsolved arson.

2453
03:01:06,560 --> 03:01:08,560
Unsolved arson.

2454
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:12,560
Anything I can help you with?

2455
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:14,560
That coffee smells good.

2456
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:16,560
Step yourself.

2457
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:22,560
Speaking of which, you're real lucky to be marrying Stephanie.

2458
03:01:22,560 --> 03:01:26,560
She don't look like a good woman.

2459
03:01:26,560 --> 03:01:30,560
I just hope she don't turn out like Mrs. Loomis.

2460
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:34,560
What do you mean she don't look like a good woman?

2461
03:01:34,560 --> 03:01:35,560
Mercy?

2462
03:01:35,560 --> 03:01:37,560
Mercy mentioned?

2463
03:01:37,560 --> 03:01:42,560
Hard on a man's needs, don't you know?

2464
03:01:42,560 --> 03:01:43,560
Stephanie?

2465
03:01:43,560 --> 03:01:48,560
Oh, gosh darn, she's pretty.

2466
03:01:48,560 --> 03:01:55,560
Kind of like a gal I seen on some of their French postcards they used to make.

2467
03:01:55,560 --> 03:01:57,560
Used to be.

2468
03:01:57,560 --> 03:02:01,560
I take them things, go back in the jail.

2469
03:02:01,560 --> 03:02:08,560
There's nobody was there and kind of look them over one handed.

2470
03:02:08,560 --> 03:02:11,560
Hold some towels.

2471
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:16,560
That was the four Mrs. Loomis.

2472
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:18,560
Huh?

2473
03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:26,560
Huh?

2474
03:02:26,560 --> 03:02:31,560
Oh, gosh, I wish I had some of them girly pictures.

2475
03:02:31,560 --> 03:02:36,560
But Mrs. Loomis won't let me keep them in the house.

2476
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:43,560
I still remember the time she caught me holding some of them pictures up with one hand.

2477
03:02:43,560 --> 03:02:47,560
She took the broom to me.

2478
03:02:47,560 --> 03:02:50,560
I held like a hound dog.

2479
03:02:50,560 --> 03:02:52,560
The broom going up and down.

2480
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:53,560
What?

2481
03:02:53,560 --> 03:02:55,560
I was crawling blood, blood and straw.

2482
03:02:55,560 --> 03:02:56,560
And I brooked.

2483
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:58,560
I was crying so bad.

2484
03:02:58,560 --> 03:03:03,560
And it was so hard I had to crawl under the porch naked.

2485
03:03:03,560 --> 03:03:08,560
With all the black winter spiders and I got bit something fierce.

2486
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:14,560
Little things are digging into my bare behind all over.

2487
03:03:14,560 --> 03:03:18,560
I ask you, is that any way to treat a man?

2488
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:31,560
And Mrs. Phelps and the sheriff don't make it no easier neither.

2489
03:03:31,560 --> 03:03:33,560
Where did that broom go?

2490
03:03:33,560 --> 03:03:35,560
What did he mean?

2491
03:03:35,560 --> 03:03:37,560
Up and down?

2492
03:03:37,560 --> 03:03:44,560
Where did it go?

2493
03:03:44,560 --> 03:03:45,560
Oh, wait.

2494
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:46,560
You're right.

2495
03:03:46,560 --> 03:03:47,560
He's cheating.

2496
03:03:47,560 --> 03:03:48,560
No, he deserved that.

2497
03:03:48,560 --> 03:03:52,560
You're right.

2498
03:03:52,560 --> 03:03:53,560
You're right.

2499
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:54,560
You're right.

2500
03:03:54,560 --> 03:03:55,560
He is a cheater.

2501
03:03:55,560 --> 03:04:04,560
We don't like, we don't like his kind.

2502
03:04:04,560 --> 03:04:10,560
Mrs. Phelps down at the general store don't help things, none.

2503
03:04:10,560 --> 03:04:13,560
She's got them special picture books.

2504
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:15,560
The one with the ladies.

2505
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:21,560
But she won't sell me none on account of she knows my wife, Mrs. Loomis.

2506
03:04:21,560 --> 03:04:25,560
That gum that don't burn my bridges.

2507
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:32,560
If I even ask about them, she tells Mrs. Loomis and I get the broom.

2508
03:04:32,560 --> 03:04:34,560
Enough to break a man's heart.

2509
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:37,560
Her burning my French postcards.

2510
03:04:37,560 --> 03:04:41,560
We unable to replace them.

2511
03:04:41,560 --> 03:04:43,560
We don't like cheaters.

2512
03:04:43,560 --> 03:04:47,560
You have a wonderful wife.

2513
03:04:47,560 --> 03:04:48,560
Man's need.

2514
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:55,560
Why, you sure ought to appreciate what a man's got to do sometimes in a parked car

2515
03:04:55,560 --> 03:04:59,560
or waste hide not hole in a tree.

2516
03:04:59,560 --> 03:05:00,560
A what?

2517
03:05:00,560 --> 03:05:01,560
A tree?

2518
03:05:01,560 --> 03:05:09,560
Matter of fact, Mrs. Phelps got no reason not to sell you some of them French postcard

2519
03:05:09,560 --> 03:05:11,560
girly picture books.

2520
03:05:11,560 --> 03:05:16,560
If you can get any, it's the clear the park with them.

2521
03:05:17,560 --> 03:05:26,560
The sheriff's at lunch and I'd be obliged.

2522
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:27,560
French postcards.

2523
03:05:27,560 --> 03:05:28,560
Of course.

2524
03:05:28,560 --> 03:05:31,560
I don't necessarily mean French postcards.

2525
03:05:31,560 --> 03:05:32,560
Oh.

2526
03:05:32,560 --> 03:05:35,560
That's just what we called them in my day.

2527
03:05:35,560 --> 03:05:43,560
In a kind of girly picture book, the kind men like would be just dandy.

2528
03:05:43,560 --> 03:05:48,560
I'd be right right, kiddo, if you were to bring me one.

2529
03:05:48,560 --> 03:05:49,560
That's the hint.

2530
03:05:49,560 --> 03:05:50,560
Got it.

2531
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:51,560
Okay.

2532
03:05:51,560 --> 03:05:53,560
What if I say fuck?

2533
03:05:53,560 --> 03:05:58,560
Don't know what you mean, kiddo.

2534
03:05:58,560 --> 03:05:59,560
Broom?

2535
03:05:59,560 --> 03:06:00,560
Don't know.

2536
03:06:00,560 --> 03:06:01,560
Okay, never mind.

2537
03:06:01,560 --> 03:06:02,560
Bye.

2538
03:06:02,560 --> 03:06:03,560
Anytime, kiddo.

2539
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:20,560
Oh, let's go to diner.

2540
03:06:20,560 --> 03:06:26,560
1955 frag 100 with a real leather leather seat.

2541
03:06:26,560 --> 03:06:39,560
Even from the ground, you can hear this sonorous, sonorous, sonorous buzz of neon.

2542
03:06:39,560 --> 03:06:42,560
Oh, wait, the sheriff's here.

2543
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:43,560
Hi.

2544
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:44,560
What's your name?

2545
03:06:44,560 --> 03:06:45,560
Karen.

2546
03:06:45,560 --> 03:06:46,560
What are you doing?

2547
03:06:46,560 --> 03:06:47,560
Playing.

2548
03:06:47,560 --> 03:06:51,560
My mom is working, so I gotta stutter her hair.

2549
03:06:51,560 --> 03:06:52,560
Wanna play?

2550
03:06:52,560 --> 03:06:54,560
Not now, maybe later.

2551
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:55,560
Okay.

2552
03:06:55,560 --> 03:06:56,560
Bye-bye.

2553
03:06:56,560 --> 03:06:57,560
Oh.

2554
03:06:57,560 --> 03:07:01,560
Why is she the normal one?

2555
03:07:01,560 --> 03:07:08,560
So nice, so no.

2556
03:07:08,560 --> 03:07:11,560
Can we get a picture book for the cage?

2557
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:23,560
Oh, you want some pretty French postcards for the cage?

2558
03:07:23,560 --> 03:07:25,560
But be a lower one.

2559
03:07:25,560 --> 03:07:26,560
Maybe.

2560
03:07:26,560 --> 03:07:27,560
Maybe.

2561
03:07:27,560 --> 03:07:30,560
But then Senpai, you're mine.

2562
03:07:30,560 --> 03:07:39,560
Dude, you only want pretty pictures of me, right?

2563
03:07:39,560 --> 03:07:45,560
Just me.

2564
03:07:45,560 --> 03:07:47,560
Good.

2565
03:07:47,560 --> 03:07:49,560
A coloring book?

2566
03:07:49,560 --> 03:07:53,560
You want pencil crayons or crayon crayon?

2567
03:07:53,560 --> 03:08:06,560
Oh, I'm afraid to give my Senpai's crayons though, but you might eat it.

2568
03:08:06,560 --> 03:08:13,560
You might eat it, just like glue.

2569
03:08:13,560 --> 03:08:25,560
I knew you would, I knew you would do that, so no coloring books for my Senpai's.

2570
03:08:25,560 --> 03:08:32,560
None, none, none, none.

2571
03:08:32,560 --> 03:08:44,560
Oh, she has a nice voice.

2572
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:53,560
You know me?

2573
03:08:54,560 --> 03:08:56,560
I guess I've changed.

2574
03:08:56,560 --> 03:08:58,560
I'm not kidding.

2575
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:09,560
Cheebie!

2576
03:09:09,560 --> 03:09:12,560
Cheebie!

2577
03:09:12,560 --> 03:09:15,560
Cheebie!

2578
03:09:15,560 --> 03:09:19,560
And me!

2579
03:09:19,560 --> 03:09:21,560
And me and Cheebie!

2580
03:09:21,560 --> 03:09:25,560
Welcome to the stream!

2581
03:09:25,560 --> 03:09:27,560
My girls are here.

2582
03:09:27,560 --> 03:09:29,560
Shut the fuck up!

2583
03:09:29,560 --> 03:09:38,560
My girls are here!

2584
03:09:38,560 --> 03:09:48,560
I'm so happy!

2585
03:09:48,560 --> 03:09:54,560
Wow, how was, how was Call of the Lamb?

2586
03:09:54,560 --> 03:09:57,560
How was Call of the Lamb?

2587
03:09:57,560 --> 03:10:00,560
I can't tell, but in me ready to, I didn't see a message.

2588
03:10:00,560 --> 03:10:02,560
Alright, it's in me just here watching me.

2589
03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:09,560
Oh, if it's in me just here watching me, I'll be, I'll be a good, I'll be a good.

2590
03:10:09,560 --> 03:10:12,560
She streamed for like nine hours.

2591
03:10:12,560 --> 03:10:17,560
Trying to, trying to catch up with Mame.

2592
03:10:17,560 --> 03:10:18,560
Just watching Cheebie.

2593
03:10:18,560 --> 03:10:21,560
Make sense, make sense.

2594
03:10:21,560 --> 03:10:23,560
Hello and good night.

2595
03:10:23,560 --> 03:10:24,560
Enjoy Harvester.

2596
03:10:24,560 --> 03:10:25,560
It's such a silly game.

2597
03:10:25,560 --> 03:10:26,560
Oh, thank you, Cheebie.

2598
03:10:26,560 --> 03:10:29,560
I didn't read, I just came out from Cheebie's stream.

2599
03:10:29,560 --> 03:10:30,560
That's no problem.

2600
03:10:30,560 --> 03:10:31,560
Thank you.

2601
03:10:31,560 --> 03:10:32,560
Thank you, girlies.

2602
03:10:32,560 --> 03:10:35,560
The two, two, two blonde girlies.

2603
03:10:35,560 --> 03:10:36,560
Ten.

2604
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:38,560
Oh, yeah.

2605
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:45,560
Like Mame, like daughter.

2606
03:10:45,560 --> 03:10:58,560
I think, I think we all take a bit of Mame's, Mame's aspects.

2607
03:10:58,560 --> 03:11:10,560
I think we, I think we do.

2608
03:11:10,560 --> 03:11:11,560
Good night, Cheebie.

2609
03:11:11,560 --> 03:11:14,560
Talk to you in.

2610
03:11:14,560 --> 03:11:17,560
What, did you inherit Mercy?

2611
03:11:17,560 --> 03:11:20,560
They can't, you know, burps.

2612
03:11:20,560 --> 03:11:21,560
Occasionally.

2613
03:11:21,560 --> 03:11:27,560
I don't think I have done it yet, but sometimes I do.

2614
03:11:27,560 --> 03:11:32,560
Good night.

2615
03:11:32,560 --> 03:11:37,560
I'll always say excuse me though.

2616
03:11:37,560 --> 03:11:43,560
What else did I inherit?

2617
03:11:43,560 --> 03:11:55,560
I'll have to ask Mame.

2618
03:11:55,560 --> 03:11:57,560
A shark, what?

2619
03:11:57,560 --> 03:11:59,560
Do you think I'm pretty shark?

2620
03:11:59,560 --> 03:12:01,560
Well, of course I am.

2621
03:12:01,560 --> 03:12:11,560
Look at these scissors.

2622
03:12:11,560 --> 03:12:15,560
I don't burp as much as Emi or Mame though.

2623
03:12:15,560 --> 03:12:25,560
I think I heard Emi say that she can do it on command, and that's really, that's really amazing.

2624
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:27,560
That's really amazing.

2625
03:12:27,560 --> 03:12:30,560
Me on the other hand, I can't do it on command.

2626
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:38,560
Anytime that happens, it'll be, it'll be by accident.

2627
03:12:38,560 --> 03:12:40,560
It's not hard to burp.

2628
03:12:40,560 --> 03:12:41,560
It's kind of hard for me.

2629
03:12:41,560 --> 03:12:45,560
I don't like, I can't, like, whistling and can't do it.

2630
03:12:45,560 --> 03:12:50,560
I can't do it.

2631
03:12:50,560 --> 03:12:52,560
Well, everyone can burp on command?

2632
03:12:52,560 --> 03:12:57,560
Am I the only one left out?

2633
03:12:57,560 --> 03:12:59,560
Could I compete for number one against Mame?

2634
03:12:59,560 --> 03:13:06,560
You might be able to, Emi.

2635
03:13:06,560 --> 03:13:08,560
I probably can't.

2636
03:13:08,560 --> 03:13:10,560
I probably can't.

2637
03:13:10,560 --> 03:13:24,560
Sometimes mine accidentally gets really loud, but I think it's because when I drink water, the air gets stuck because my uvula is kind of enlarged so it might get caught behind it.

2638
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:27,560
That's, that's Ethereum, not quite sure.

2639
03:13:27,560 --> 03:13:32,560
And then I let out a big one, but I don't think it's a record, but I haven't yet.

2640
03:13:32,560 --> 03:13:35,560
I sneeze a lot more than I burp though.

2641
03:13:35,560 --> 03:14:04,560
I never realized it, but after like seeing my, one time seeing my sneeze together, I was like, oh, I sneeze the same way over and over.

2642
03:14:04,560 --> 03:14:26,560
You breathe in while lifting your palate or something until you hear a little pop and you exhale and burp.

2643
03:14:26,560 --> 03:14:33,560
I think I just feel coffee from that.

2644
03:14:33,560 --> 03:14:34,560
Hey, Karen.

2645
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:36,560
You've met Karen, my eight year old.

2646
03:14:36,560 --> 03:14:37,560
Oh, she's so cute.

2647
03:14:37,560 --> 03:14:39,560
Other than the diner, she's all I have.

2648
03:14:39,560 --> 03:14:41,560
Oh!

2649
03:14:41,560 --> 03:14:47,560
No, something bad's gonna happen, I feel it.

2650
03:14:47,560 --> 03:14:52,560
Ah!

2651
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:55,560
Hey, Kohai, what's the tea of the day?

2652
03:14:55,560 --> 03:15:10,560
Orange ginger.

2653
03:15:10,560 --> 03:15:12,560
Yeah, I don't think I don't want to burp.

2654
03:15:12,560 --> 03:15:13,560
Thank you.

2655
03:15:13,560 --> 03:15:14,560
Let's not burp right now.

2656
03:15:14,560 --> 03:15:15,560
I don't want to force it.

2657
03:15:15,560 --> 03:15:16,560
I might get sick.

2658
03:15:16,560 --> 03:15:24,560
I feel a little sick probably because I've been a little unwell, probably because I've kind of overworked myself.

2659
03:15:24,560 --> 03:15:25,560
This is an entirely full week.

2660
03:15:25,560 --> 03:15:29,560
I'm actually probably, I'm thinking I might move a few weeks.

2661
03:15:29,560 --> 03:15:33,560
Wait, I might feel a burp.

2662
03:15:33,560 --> 03:15:38,560
Is it working?

2663
03:15:38,560 --> 03:15:47,560
No, nothing.

2664
03:15:47,560 --> 03:15:48,560
No, nothing.

2665
03:15:48,560 --> 03:15:59,560
But yeah, I'm a little sick because I think I've overworked myself a little bit.

2666
03:15:59,560 --> 03:16:07,560
Because I might lower my schedule for next week because I really need a big break, at least a day of rest.

2667
03:16:07,560 --> 03:16:17,560
Because even when I'm off streaming, I still have to keep up that social media presence as well.

2668
03:16:17,560 --> 03:16:20,560
And then I have to think of things and events to do.

2669
03:16:20,560 --> 03:16:33,560
And then I have to work on my audios and then additional videos if possible.

2670
03:16:33,560 --> 03:16:37,560
So it doesn't sound like a lot, but it takes a lot of time for all of them.

2671
03:16:37,560 --> 03:16:39,560
And it takes a lot of energy.

2672
03:16:39,560 --> 03:16:41,560
It could be due to stress too.

2673
03:16:41,560 --> 03:16:45,560
I should probably rest up a little more.

2674
03:16:45,560 --> 03:16:49,560
But I want this tomorrow is the last day of the full week.

2675
03:16:49,560 --> 03:16:56,560
So hopefully I can find some way to slow down a little bit.

2676
03:16:56,560 --> 03:17:01,560
So yeah, everyone can see all types of games that I play.

2677
03:17:01,560 --> 03:17:03,560
Wait, did I talk about Stephanie already?

2678
03:17:03,560 --> 03:17:07,560
There isn't a nicer girl in Harvest than Stephanie, Steve.

2679
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:10,560
You should be grateful that she's promised you her hand.

2680
03:17:10,560 --> 03:17:13,560
I don't remember that happening, Edna.

2681
03:17:13,560 --> 03:17:17,560
Honestly, you men are so childish.

2682
03:17:17,560 --> 03:17:22,560
I don't know what it is about marriage that turns even the bravest man into a coward.

2683
03:17:22,560 --> 03:17:27,560
I was going to marry Karen's father when he just up and ran out on me one night.

2684
03:17:27,560 --> 03:17:28,560
We hate him.

2685
03:17:28,560 --> 03:17:30,560
I heard that he joined the lodge.

2686
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:32,560
But if he did, I never saw him come out again.

2687
03:17:32,560 --> 03:17:38,560
Even Sheriff Dwayne wasn't able to find out what happened to him.

2688
03:17:38,560 --> 03:17:43,560
Mr. Johnson has a liking for me.

2689
03:17:43,560 --> 03:17:47,560
I call it a crush, but that's too innocent a word.

2690
03:17:47,560 --> 03:17:51,560
He's a bitter man with too much time on his hands.

2691
03:17:51,560 --> 03:17:54,560
He's never gotten over being rejected by the lodge.

2692
03:17:54,560 --> 03:17:58,560
And there's something unwholesome in the way he looks at me.

2693
03:17:58,560 --> 03:18:03,560
I'm always glad when the sheriff comes in every day at noon.

2694
03:18:03,560 --> 03:18:07,560
The lodge is the repository of all wisdom.

2695
03:18:07,560 --> 03:18:10,560
You should join the order of the Harvest Moon, Steve.

2696
03:18:10,560 --> 03:18:12,560
And soon.

2697
03:18:12,560 --> 03:18:13,560
Why?

2698
03:18:13,560 --> 03:18:14,560
And soon.

2699
03:18:14,560 --> 03:18:16,560
I'd say, what is it about this place?

2700
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:19,560
The wheat ripens and waits not for the sigh.

2701
03:18:19,560 --> 03:18:21,560
The farmer who waits too long.

2702
03:18:21,560 --> 03:18:22,560
Wait.

2703
03:18:22,560 --> 03:18:26,560
He used the sigh to rip his own stomach out then to stay his side when the wheat ripens.

2704
03:18:26,560 --> 03:18:29,560
The Harvest Moon wanes and then comes winter.

2705
03:18:29,560 --> 03:18:30,560
An empty belly.

2706
03:18:30,560 --> 03:18:31,560
The body stands.

2707
03:18:31,560 --> 03:18:32,560
The body stands, belly.

2708
03:18:32,560 --> 03:18:34,560
Lurgling within or bloody on the ground.

2709
03:18:34,560 --> 03:18:38,560
What does it benefit a man if he gains his soul and loses the world?

2710
03:18:38,560 --> 03:18:40,560
You hunger.

2711
03:18:40,560 --> 03:18:42,560
Feed yourself.

2712
03:18:42,560 --> 03:18:44,560
Before it's too late.

2713
03:18:44,560 --> 03:18:45,560
Late.

2714
03:18:45,560 --> 03:18:46,560
Oh.

2715
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:48,560
What's wrong?

2716
03:18:48,560 --> 03:18:50,560
Steve.

2717
03:18:50,560 --> 03:18:54,560
Well, what happened?

2718
03:18:54,560 --> 03:18:57,560
Were we talking about Boyle?

2719
03:18:57,560 --> 03:18:58,560
Or was it Karen?

2720
03:18:58,560 --> 03:19:00,560
You seem strange there for a minute.

2721
03:19:00,560 --> 03:19:02,560
I'm sorry.

2722
03:19:02,560 --> 03:19:04,560
I'm under a lot of stress.

2723
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:07,560
Running this diner all alone.

2724
03:19:07,560 --> 03:19:10,560
Forgive me.

2725
03:19:10,560 --> 03:19:14,560
You've met Karen.

2726
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:15,560
Bye.

2727
03:19:15,560 --> 03:19:17,560
Stop by anytime, Steve.

2728
03:19:17,560 --> 03:19:18,560
Hello there, Steve.

2729
03:19:18,560 --> 03:19:19,560
Here for lunch?

2730
03:19:19,560 --> 03:19:20,560
Yep.

2731
03:19:20,560 --> 03:19:21,560
No.

2732
03:19:21,560 --> 03:19:22,560
Just here looking around.

2733
03:19:22,560 --> 03:19:25,560
Well, I'm not entirely sure where here is.

2734
03:19:25,560 --> 03:19:27,560
She's under a lot of stress, Boyle.

2735
03:19:27,560 --> 03:19:30,560
You need a break before you start speaking in tongues.

2736
03:19:30,560 --> 03:19:34,560
Well, Boyle, this is DNA's diner.

2737
03:19:34,560 --> 03:19:35,560
Isn't that right, Edna?

2738
03:19:35,560 --> 03:19:37,560
Don't listen to Sheriff Dwayne.

2739
03:19:37,560 --> 03:19:39,560
This is Edna's diner.

2740
03:19:39,560 --> 03:19:41,560
But ever since the E burned out on the sign,

2741
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:43,560
they've been giving me a hard time.

2742
03:19:43,560 --> 03:19:45,560
Now, don't be like that, Edna.

2743
03:19:45,560 --> 03:19:48,560
It's a great place to eat, which is good.

2744
03:19:48,560 --> 03:19:51,560
Since it's the only place to eat in harvest.

2745
03:19:51,560 --> 03:19:52,560
Bye.

2746
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:59,560
Stop on by anytime, Steve.

2747
03:19:59,560 --> 03:20:03,560
Oh, how do I exit?

2748
03:20:03,560 --> 03:20:04,560
Oh, here it is.

2749
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:05,560
Oh, wait.

2750
03:20:05,560 --> 03:20:11,560
Is there anything else I should look at?

2751
03:20:11,560 --> 03:20:19,560
Well, the diner people seem nice.

2752
03:20:19,560 --> 03:20:21,560
Oh, wrong place.

2753
03:20:21,560 --> 03:20:28,560
I meant to go to the thing.

2754
03:20:28,560 --> 03:20:44,560
Is he still at the police station?

2755
03:20:44,560 --> 03:20:46,560
Hold on.

2756
03:20:46,560 --> 03:21:02,560
Just in case.

2757
03:21:02,560 --> 03:21:06,560
Here's your girly magazine.

2758
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:11,560
Oh, oh, by George.

2759
03:21:11,560 --> 03:21:13,560
Oh, by Jiminy.

2760
03:21:13,560 --> 03:21:20,560
Oh, can I have it?

2761
03:21:20,560 --> 03:21:21,560
Yeah.

2762
03:21:21,560 --> 03:21:24,560
Oh, thank you, Steve.

2763
03:21:24,560 --> 03:21:26,560
Excuse me, kiddo.

2764
03:21:26,560 --> 03:21:39,560
I've got to go check the jail for clean towels.

2765
03:21:39,560 --> 03:21:44,560
Oh, yeah.

2766
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:48,560
Now the evidence room is mine.

2767
03:21:48,560 --> 03:21:52,560
Never mind.

2768
03:21:52,560 --> 03:21:57,560
This fairly legible note.

2769
03:21:57,560 --> 03:22:01,560
Checkbook.

2770
03:22:01,560 --> 03:22:08,560
Give me the key.

2771
03:22:08,560 --> 03:22:35,560
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to click that exit.

2772
03:22:35,560 --> 03:22:39,560
Give me the stuff.

2773
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:43,560
A berry.

2774
03:22:43,560 --> 03:22:47,560
Arbus brand, old brand of smokes.

2775
03:22:47,560 --> 03:22:51,560
Where is it?

2776
03:22:51,560 --> 03:22:54,560
Beer.

2777
03:22:54,560 --> 03:23:00,560
There it is.

2778
03:23:00,560 --> 03:23:03,560
Anything else?

2779
03:23:03,560 --> 03:23:18,560
I didn't work like that, too.

2780
03:23:18,560 --> 03:23:21,560
Is there anything else?

2781
03:23:21,560 --> 03:23:35,560
Is there anything else in here?

2782
03:23:35,560 --> 03:23:39,560
Take the shoes.

2783
03:23:39,560 --> 03:23:41,560
The bear?

2784
03:23:41,560 --> 03:23:44,560
Bear is wielding a chainsaw.

2785
03:23:44,560 --> 03:23:50,560
What's with all these models?

2786
03:23:50,560 --> 03:23:52,560
There's another woman's body.

2787
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:54,560
Oh, I'm surprised.

2788
03:23:54,560 --> 03:23:57,560
Loomis has painted this evidence.

2789
03:23:57,560 --> 03:24:05,560
Bottom right here.

2790
03:24:05,560 --> 03:24:07,560
Hello, Steve.

2791
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:15,560
Where's Loomis?

2792
03:24:15,560 --> 03:24:19,560
Loomis, have you?

2793
03:24:19,560 --> 03:24:34,560
No.

2794
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:37,560
Did I fuck up?

2795
03:24:49,560 --> 03:24:57,560
Okay, I can go back in again.

2796
03:24:57,560 --> 03:25:05,560
Is there anything else I can grab?

2797
03:25:05,560 --> 03:25:09,560
Loomis's light relatives.

2798
03:25:09,560 --> 03:25:14,560
Prop helps the sheriff meet a ticket quota.

2799
03:25:14,560 --> 03:25:37,560
Is there anything else in here?

2800
03:25:37,560 --> 03:25:43,560
Okay, if there's nothing else, let's get out of here.

2801
03:25:43,560 --> 03:25:53,560
Door's locked.

2802
03:25:53,560 --> 03:25:59,560
TV station.

2803
03:25:59,560 --> 03:26:09,560
Sorry, I meant to go to Edna's diner.

2804
03:26:09,560 --> 03:26:12,560
Oh, he's back here again, okay.

2805
03:26:13,560 --> 03:26:30,560
Okay, bye.

2806
03:26:30,560 --> 03:26:36,560
Okay, let's do...

2807
03:26:36,560 --> 03:26:41,560
Let's go to the TV station.

2808
03:26:41,560 --> 03:26:45,560
Let's go to the game.

2809
03:26:45,560 --> 03:26:47,560
As long as we don't fuck up.

2810
03:26:47,560 --> 03:26:49,560
Oh, I should have just saved into a different one.

2811
03:26:49,560 --> 03:26:57,560
Too busy drinking and smoking, they ignore you.

2812
03:26:57,560 --> 03:27:10,560
Oh, they found it here.

2813
03:27:10,560 --> 03:27:17,560
Steve.

2814
03:27:17,560 --> 03:27:18,560
Yeah.

2815
03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:23,560
Yeah, yes.

2816
03:27:23,560 --> 03:27:28,560
Oh, TV violence.

2817
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:39,560
I love all the blood and gore on your show.

2818
03:27:39,560 --> 03:27:43,560
Here's the commentary.

2819
03:27:43,560 --> 03:28:00,560
Just look at the net profits.

2820
03:28:00,560 --> 03:28:04,560
Huh?

2821
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:11,560
Very poor reception is strange since the broadcast originates from here.

2822
03:28:11,560 --> 03:28:16,560
A picture of a gorgeous model signed with a kiss my pineapple.

2823
03:28:16,560 --> 03:28:21,560
Red and muffy.

2824
03:28:21,560 --> 03:28:27,560
An assortment of empty cubicles, either McKnight loves to recall his salad days as an insurance salesman.

2825
03:28:27,560 --> 03:28:33,560
You can't keep up with him, or you can't keep his employees happy.

2826
03:28:33,560 --> 03:28:35,560
Hey, Sport, this is a private office.

2827
03:28:35,560 --> 03:28:38,560
Yeah, I know, Mr. McKnight.

2828
03:28:38,560 --> 03:28:40,560
I own and operate this station.

2829
03:28:40,560 --> 03:28:43,560
Have you brought me some news for the night broadcast, or...

2830
03:28:43,560 --> 03:28:45,560
I've lost my memory.

2831
03:28:45,560 --> 03:28:46,560
That's news.

2832
03:28:46,560 --> 03:28:48,560
The hell it is.

2833
03:28:48,560 --> 03:28:50,560
You always were a kid, or Steve.

2834
03:28:50,560 --> 03:28:52,560
Any real news to tell me?

2835
03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:55,560
Actually, I was just wanting to know more about the TV station.

2836
03:28:55,560 --> 03:28:56,560
Huh.

2837
03:28:56,560 --> 03:29:00,560
Hey, W-H-A-R is the only television station in Harvest.

2838
03:29:00,560 --> 03:29:04,560
Since the old Sentinel went under, what with the newspaper building burning down and all?

2839
03:29:04,560 --> 03:29:05,560
We're golden.

2840
03:29:05,560 --> 03:29:08,560
Nobody competes with us, Sport.

2841
03:29:08,560 --> 03:29:12,560
Did you burn it down?

2842
03:29:12,560 --> 03:29:16,560
On Quincet.

2843
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:19,560
Hey, now, Sport, that's an irresponsible allegation.

2844
03:29:19,560 --> 03:29:21,560
I had nothing to do with that fire.

2845
03:29:21,560 --> 03:29:26,560
Just because W-H-A-R may have benefited from it, and I danced on the ashes a little, doesn't mean...

2846
03:29:26,560 --> 03:29:28,560
A little?

2847
03:29:28,560 --> 03:29:30,560
You can share it the way, and give me doubts.

2848
03:29:30,560 --> 03:29:34,560
You seem awfully touchy on the subject, Sport.

2849
03:29:34,560 --> 03:29:38,560
I'm touchy when people try to muscle their way into my business.

2850
03:29:38,560 --> 03:29:43,560
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave my office, and don't come back.

2851
03:29:43,560 --> 03:29:44,560
No.

2852
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:46,560
Don't hurry back.

2853
03:29:52,560 --> 03:29:57,560
What about the villains?

2854
03:29:57,560 --> 03:29:58,560
Oh, okay.

2855
03:29:58,560 --> 03:30:00,560
What's the first choice?

2856
03:30:14,560 --> 03:30:16,560
Whoa!

2857
03:30:21,560 --> 03:30:23,560
Godless heathen engines.

2858
03:30:23,560 --> 03:30:26,560
Most kids don't see godless heathen engines on a regular basis,

2859
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:29,560
and if they do, they'd better either get their eyes checked,

2860
03:30:29,560 --> 03:30:32,560
or do like old range rider, and shoot the bejesus out of them.

2861
03:30:32,560 --> 03:30:35,560
Lest they want to go untreated for psychotic hallucinations,

2862
03:30:35,560 --> 03:30:38,560
or wind up with their scalps hanging from a buckskin...

2863
03:30:38,560 --> 03:30:39,560
YouTube!

2864
03:30:39,560 --> 03:30:40,560
Shit!

2865
03:30:40,560 --> 03:30:41,560
Ow!

2866
03:30:41,560 --> 03:30:43,560
Shit on a sticker room!

2867
03:30:47,560 --> 03:30:49,560
YouTube, this is part of game!

2868
03:30:49,560 --> 03:30:52,560
The parents that are griping about violence on TV

2869
03:30:52,560 --> 03:30:56,560
are the same parents that go outside in the morning to fetch their papers,

2870
03:30:56,560 --> 03:31:00,560
secure in the knowledge that they won't get an arrow through the noodle,

2871
03:31:00,560 --> 03:31:05,560
because the violence they hate so much done cleared the engines out of the neighborhood.

2872
03:31:05,560 --> 03:31:09,560
Yeah, civilization has benefited from violence.

2873
03:31:09,560 --> 03:31:12,560
But should violence be treated as entertainment?

2874
03:31:12,560 --> 03:31:14,560
Check my rating, son.

2875
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:16,560
Violence is entertainment.

2876
03:31:16,560 --> 03:31:18,560
I just put it on the air.

2877
03:31:18,560 --> 03:31:22,560
That says something about the kid, not me.

2878
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:26,560
Now, excuse me, we're going back on the air.

2879
03:31:27,560 --> 03:31:28,560
Alright.

2880
03:31:30,560 --> 03:31:33,560
Aw, no one's operating the camera.

2881
03:31:35,560 --> 03:31:39,560
A corny western backdrop complete with a cardboard teepee.

2882
03:31:43,560 --> 03:31:44,560
Hmm.

2883
03:31:45,560 --> 03:31:47,560
Either the show isn't compelling,

2884
03:31:47,560 --> 03:31:51,560
or no one wanted to be taken out by friendly...

2885
03:31:51,560 --> 03:31:52,560
by friendly fire.

2886
03:31:52,560 --> 03:31:55,560
A fairly primitive form of mind control.

2887
03:32:09,560 --> 03:32:11,560
We can exit this way.

2888
03:32:14,560 --> 03:32:15,560
The meat plant.

2889
03:32:17,560 --> 03:32:19,560
We should save.

2890
03:32:19,560 --> 03:32:22,560
I don't know, it seems dangerous to go to a meat plant.

2891
03:32:22,560 --> 03:32:25,560
What's with... what is that? Are these cats?

2892
03:32:52,560 --> 03:32:54,560
Cats?

2893
03:32:57,560 --> 03:32:59,560
Is that a bone?

2894
03:33:22,560 --> 03:33:24,560
Steve, I didn't want to believe that amnesia hook'em.

2895
03:33:24,560 --> 03:33:27,560
Now you're saying you don't remember your pal, Pat O'Reilly?

2896
03:33:27,560 --> 03:33:29,560
Pat O'Reilly, huh?

2897
03:33:29,560 --> 03:33:31,560
Oh, let's talk about the family business, I guess.

2898
03:33:31,560 --> 03:33:33,560
Why are they in the meat plant?

2899
03:33:33,560 --> 03:33:36,560
Because daddy owns the meat plant.

2900
03:33:39,560 --> 03:33:42,560
You may come to realize that this business is not for everybody.

2901
03:33:42,560 --> 03:33:45,560
Just ask your poor, ill dad.

2902
03:33:45,560 --> 03:33:48,560
It takes dedication and a strong stomach.

2903
03:33:53,560 --> 03:33:55,560
A lot of times, when I'm finished scrubbing up

2904
03:33:55,560 --> 03:33:58,560
and digging the bits of intestine out from my fingernails,

2905
03:33:58,560 --> 03:34:01,560
I must confess, I don't have much appetite for red meat.

2906
03:34:01,560 --> 03:34:04,560
But red meat is one of the principal food groups,

2907
03:34:04,560 --> 03:34:06,560
and you've got to have it.

2908
03:34:06,560 --> 03:34:08,560
So when you can do this all day,

2909
03:34:08,560 --> 03:34:11,560
and help yourself to a juicy red steak afterwards,

2910
03:34:11,560 --> 03:34:14,560
then by golly, you can call yourself a butcher.

2911
03:34:16,560 --> 03:34:17,560
Alright!

2912
03:34:17,560 --> 03:34:20,560
Of course, amnesia would certainly help that, wouldn't it?

2913
03:34:20,560 --> 03:34:22,560
Dad's on this.

2914
03:34:31,560 --> 03:34:33,560
Does everyone want to get me into lodge?

2915
03:34:33,560 --> 03:34:35,560
Amnesia?

2916
03:34:41,560 --> 03:34:43,560
Kitter count.

2917
03:34:50,560 --> 03:34:53,560
You're gonna need to start behaving like an adult,

2918
03:34:53,560 --> 03:34:56,560
especially if you're gonna take over the family business.

2919
03:34:58,560 --> 03:35:00,560
Family business?

2920
03:35:15,560 --> 03:35:17,560
Meat?

2921
03:35:21,560 --> 03:35:23,560
Where do you keep the animals?

2922
03:35:24,560 --> 03:35:26,560
Does it matter?

2923
03:35:26,560 --> 03:35:29,560
The end product is all the customer cares about, Steve.

2924
03:35:29,560 --> 03:35:31,560
And we only carry the finest meat,

2925
03:35:31,560 --> 03:35:33,560
only the juiciest cuts.

2926
03:35:34,560 --> 03:35:36,560
What do you use?

2927
03:35:36,560 --> 03:35:38,560
Once you take over the business,

2928
03:35:38,560 --> 03:35:40,560
you'll realize the importance of maintaining quality

2929
03:35:40,560 --> 03:35:42,560
while cutting costs.

2930
03:35:42,560 --> 03:35:44,560
We know what we're doing.

2931
03:35:44,560 --> 03:35:45,560
We didn't.

2932
03:35:45,560 --> 03:35:47,560
Would the lodge use us to cater their affairs?

2933
03:35:54,560 --> 03:35:56,560
Good. Could I take some meat to take home?

2934
03:36:06,560 --> 03:36:08,560
Okay, here's a hint.

2935
03:36:08,560 --> 03:36:10,560
Cutting costs.

2936
03:36:14,560 --> 03:36:16,560
If you're cutting up the meat, you'll be privy to them.

2937
03:36:16,560 --> 03:36:18,560
There's always cheaper, better ways to do things.

2938
03:36:18,560 --> 03:36:20,560
If you're creative.

2939
03:36:20,560 --> 03:36:22,560
If you're creative?

2940
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:26,560
Family business?

2941
03:36:40,560 --> 03:36:42,560
Goodbye!

2942
03:36:44,560 --> 03:36:46,560
That's nice, I guess.

2943
03:36:47,560 --> 03:36:50,560
There are several small animals.

2944
03:36:53,560 --> 03:36:55,560
This used to be a kitty cat.

2945
03:36:55,560 --> 03:36:57,560
Okay, we're eating!

2946
03:36:57,560 --> 03:36:59,560
The plant's eating!

2947
03:36:59,560 --> 03:37:01,560
Cats understood.

2948
03:37:07,560 --> 03:37:09,560
Is there anything else in here?

2949
03:37:09,560 --> 03:37:11,560
Okay, I need a written note.

2950
03:37:14,560 --> 03:37:16,560
Let me go back to my house.

2951
03:37:22,560 --> 03:37:24,560
What do I have?

2952
03:37:24,560 --> 03:37:26,560
Got a pen, newspaper,

2953
03:37:26,560 --> 03:37:28,560
aspirin,

2954
03:37:28,560 --> 03:37:30,560
off-medicine,

2955
03:37:30,560 --> 03:37:32,560
vitamins, tampons.

2956
03:37:32,560 --> 03:37:34,560
What do I have?

2957
03:37:34,560 --> 03:37:36,560
I got a pen, newspaper,

2958
03:37:36,560 --> 03:37:38,560
aspirin,

2959
03:37:38,560 --> 03:37:40,560
off-medicine, vitamins,

2960
03:37:40,560 --> 03:37:42,560
tampons,

2961
03:37:42,560 --> 03:37:44,560
tampons,

2962
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:46,560
jar of oralu,

2963
03:37:46,560 --> 03:37:48,560
shovel,

2964
03:37:48,560 --> 03:37:50,560
bloody sneakers,

2965
03:37:50,560 --> 03:37:52,560
gas can,

2966
03:37:52,560 --> 03:37:54,560
camera,

2967
03:37:54,560 --> 03:37:56,560
checkbook.

2968
03:37:56,560 --> 03:37:58,560
What does it say? I can't fucking see!

2969
03:37:58,560 --> 03:38:00,560
Deposit boil,

2970
03:38:00,560 --> 03:38:02,560
deposit boil, deposit boil,

2971
03:38:02,560 --> 03:38:04,560
check,

2972
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:06,560
boil,

2973
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:08,560
deposit,

2974
03:38:08,560 --> 03:38:10,560
boil, tulip ammunition,

2975
03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:12,560
one crate of shells.

2976
03:38:14,560 --> 03:38:16,560
Oh, it is the war, guys, huh?

2977
03:38:22,560 --> 03:38:24,560
No, right-click to view.

2978
03:38:24,560 --> 03:38:26,560
Sheriff, if you think...

2979
03:38:30,560 --> 03:38:32,560
I'm going to keep paying this...

2980
03:38:36,560 --> 03:38:38,560
forever.

2981
03:38:38,560 --> 03:38:40,560
You are crazy. There are limits.

2982
03:38:40,560 --> 03:38:42,560
Boil.

2983
03:38:42,560 --> 03:38:44,560
Who's Boil again?

2984
03:38:58,560 --> 03:39:00,560
Can I use this?

2985
03:39:08,560 --> 03:39:10,560
Can I use this?

2986
03:39:14,560 --> 03:39:16,560
Meet permission sleep.

2987
03:39:16,560 --> 03:39:18,560
Okay.

2988
03:39:36,560 --> 03:39:38,560
We're saving.

2989
03:39:42,560 --> 03:39:44,560
Check out the windows.

2990
03:39:44,560 --> 03:39:46,560
Like at my house?

2991
03:39:54,560 --> 03:39:56,560
I need...

2992
03:39:56,560 --> 03:39:58,560
It says fill up head screws.

2993
03:39:58,560 --> 03:40:00,560
I don't have screw.

2994
03:40:00,560 --> 03:40:02,560
I don't have a screw unless I use

2995
03:40:02,560 --> 03:40:04,560
like something irrational,

2996
03:40:04,560 --> 03:40:06,560
like a shovel.

2997
03:40:06,560 --> 03:40:08,560
Damn it.

2998
03:40:08,560 --> 03:40:10,560
See?

2999
03:40:14,560 --> 03:40:16,560
It'd be hilarious if it worked.

3000
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:18,560
Yeah.

3001
03:40:18,560 --> 03:40:20,560
I don't have a knife.

3002
03:40:26,560 --> 03:40:28,560
What does this mean?

3003
03:40:30,560 --> 03:40:32,560
No...

3004
03:40:32,560 --> 03:40:34,560
Why...

3005
03:40:34,560 --> 03:40:36,560
Is the Sheriff blackmailing you?

3006
03:40:36,560 --> 03:40:38,560
That's an interesting item.

3007
03:40:38,560 --> 03:40:40,560
But the fact that you asked me that question

3008
03:40:40,560 --> 03:40:42,560
proves you know nothing.

3009
03:40:44,560 --> 03:40:46,560
I can show these around

3010
03:40:46,560 --> 03:40:48,560
and prove both of you

3011
03:40:48,560 --> 03:40:50,560
are guilty of something.

3012
03:40:50,560 --> 03:40:52,560
You do that, Steve.

3013
03:40:52,560 --> 03:40:54,560
Not knowing what we're guilty of,

3014
03:40:54,560 --> 03:40:56,560
how much trouble can you cause?

3015
03:40:56,560 --> 03:40:58,560
Except for yourself.

3016
03:40:58,560 --> 03:41:00,560
Oh, yeah?

3017
03:41:00,560 --> 03:41:02,560
I want to do it again.

3018
03:41:02,560 --> 03:41:04,560
What does this mean?

3019
03:41:04,560 --> 03:41:06,560
I know why the Sheriff

3020
03:41:06,560 --> 03:41:08,560
is blackmailing you.

3021
03:41:08,560 --> 03:41:10,560
This is unexpected

3022
03:41:10,560 --> 03:41:12,560
and awkward.

3023
03:41:12,560 --> 03:41:14,560
But my luck's been bad ever since Dwayne

3024
03:41:14,560 --> 03:41:16,560
found that darn gas can at the newspaper

3025
03:41:16,560 --> 03:41:18,560
building the day after the fire.

3026
03:41:18,560 --> 03:41:20,560
He has this insane notion that it's mine.

3027
03:41:20,560 --> 03:41:22,560
I pay him not

3028
03:41:22,560 --> 03:41:24,560
because I'm guilty, but because I don't want

3029
03:41:24,560 --> 03:41:26,560
him slurring my good name around harvest.

3030
03:41:26,560 --> 03:41:28,560
Oh, naturally.

3031
03:41:28,560 --> 03:41:30,560
You know, he keeps that gas can

3032
03:41:30,560 --> 03:41:32,560
in the evidence room at his office.

3033
03:41:32,560 --> 03:41:34,560
I'd be really grateful

3034
03:41:34,560 --> 03:41:36,560
to whoever could fetch me that can.

3035
03:41:36,560 --> 03:41:38,560
Grateful enough

3036
03:41:38,560 --> 03:41:40,560
to provide him with a lodge application.

3037
03:41:40,560 --> 03:41:42,560
Oh, and Steve,

3038
03:41:42,560 --> 03:41:44,560
you'll keep this to yourself

3039
03:41:44,560 --> 03:41:46,560
if you're smart.

3040
03:41:50,560 --> 03:41:52,560
I can trade it,

3041
03:41:52,560 --> 03:41:54,560
but I want to see what the fingerprints do.

3042
03:41:58,560 --> 03:42:00,560
Or I don't even have that.

3043
03:42:00,560 --> 03:42:02,560
Can I figure out if he did it or not?

3044
03:42:06,560 --> 03:42:08,560
I'm going to do it anyways.

3045
03:42:08,560 --> 03:42:10,560
Against my better judgment,

3046
03:42:10,560 --> 03:42:12,560
what do you think, Senpai?

3047
03:42:20,560 --> 03:42:22,560
We give it...

3048
03:42:22,560 --> 03:42:24,560
We give it...

3049
03:42:26,560 --> 03:42:28,560
Yes.

3050
03:42:38,560 --> 03:42:40,560
You know, this morning

3051
03:42:40,560 --> 03:42:42,560
as I was making my rounds,

3052
03:42:42,560 --> 03:42:44,560
I noticed an awful lot of television

3053
03:42:44,560 --> 03:42:46,560
aerials on the roofs.

3054
03:42:46,560 --> 03:42:48,560
Seems like more and more each day.

3055
03:42:48,560 --> 03:42:50,560
You got me this can

3056
03:42:50,560 --> 03:42:52,560
just in time, youngster.

3057
03:42:52,560 --> 03:42:54,560
I may have need of it again.

3058
03:42:54,560 --> 03:42:56,560
What do you mean?

3059
03:42:56,560 --> 03:42:58,560
There's another reason why Sheriff Dwayne

3060
03:42:58,560 --> 03:43:00,560
didn't investigate the Sentinel fire.

3061
03:43:00,560 --> 03:43:02,560
If you'd like to get something else

3062
03:43:02,560 --> 03:43:04,560
on the black mailing bastard, check around

3063
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:06,560
the television station.

3064
03:43:06,560 --> 03:43:08,560
Why do you still can?

3065
03:43:08,560 --> 03:43:10,560
Okay.

3066
03:43:10,560 --> 03:43:12,560
Did I get a launch application thing?

3067
03:43:18,560 --> 03:43:20,560
Can I use the pen on it?

3068
03:43:20,560 --> 03:43:22,560
That's a ticket.

3069
03:43:30,560 --> 03:43:32,560
Can I give this to my brother?

3070
03:43:36,560 --> 03:43:38,560
Okay.

3071
03:43:42,560 --> 03:43:44,560
I hope you understand what he means.

3072
03:43:44,560 --> 03:43:46,560
As in like the...

3073
03:43:48,560 --> 03:43:50,560
The place is going to go down in flames?

3074
03:44:00,560 --> 03:44:02,560
Should I...

3075
03:44:02,560 --> 03:44:04,560
Is there anything at the station

3076
03:44:04,560 --> 03:44:06,560
that I need or that I missed?

3077
03:44:22,560 --> 03:44:24,560
Yes?

3078
03:44:28,560 --> 03:44:30,560
There's an off-shelf thing in the back.

3079
03:44:30,560 --> 03:44:32,560
Okay.

3080
03:44:32,560 --> 03:44:34,560
Nothing.

3081
03:44:44,560 --> 03:44:46,560
What is...

3082
03:44:48,560 --> 03:44:50,560
Where can I get the...

3083
03:44:52,560 --> 03:44:54,560
Get it.

3084
03:45:02,560 --> 03:45:04,560
Okay.

3085
03:45:24,560 --> 03:45:26,560
Oops.

3086
03:45:26,560 --> 03:45:28,560
No, no, no.

3087
03:45:28,560 --> 03:45:30,560
Go back.

3088
03:45:30,560 --> 03:45:32,560
How do I get the number?

3089
03:46:00,560 --> 03:46:02,560
This is your first arrest, Steve.

3090
03:46:02,560 --> 03:46:04,560
You just remember.

3091
03:46:04,560 --> 03:46:06,560
We've got three strikes.

3092
03:46:06,560 --> 03:46:08,560
You're out rule here in harvest.

3093
03:46:08,560 --> 03:46:10,560
But you keep your nose clean.

3094
03:46:10,560 --> 03:46:12,560
You're here.

3095
03:46:16,560 --> 03:46:18,560
So I didn't get arrested?

3096
03:46:24,560 --> 03:46:26,560
Oh, good kiss, good night.

3097
03:46:26,560 --> 03:46:28,560
And I got tucked in. That's nice.

3098
03:46:30,560 --> 03:46:32,560
Okay.

3099
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:42,560
You're in trouble.

3100
03:46:42,560 --> 03:46:44,560
How does it feel to be a jailbird?

3101
03:46:46,560 --> 03:46:48,560
I think it makes you miss out on stuff though.

3102
03:46:48,560 --> 03:46:50,560
Okay, I'll just...

3103
03:46:50,560 --> 03:46:52,560
Yeah.

3104
03:46:52,560 --> 03:46:54,560
What are you yet?

3105
03:46:54,560 --> 03:46:56,560
You better not get caught against, Steve.

3106
03:46:56,560 --> 03:46:58,560
You played your get-out jail-free card.

3107
03:46:58,560 --> 03:47:00,560
Next time, you'll be in...

3108
03:47:02,560 --> 03:47:04,560
Does that make me miss things?

3109
03:47:04,560 --> 03:47:06,560
I can just load the game again.

3110
03:47:28,560 --> 03:47:30,560
Hmm.

3111
03:47:38,560 --> 03:47:40,560
Hmm.

3112
03:47:42,560 --> 03:47:44,560
I'm a mar...

3113
03:47:44,560 --> 03:47:46,560
I'm a mario school.

3114
03:47:58,560 --> 03:48:00,560
Hmm.

3115
03:48:20,560 --> 03:48:22,560
Hmm.

3116
03:48:28,560 --> 03:48:30,560
Quality time.

3117
03:48:36,560 --> 03:48:38,560
Quality time?

3118
03:48:38,560 --> 03:48:40,560
I don't know.

3119
03:48:58,560 --> 03:49:00,560
Who's first name escapes me?

3120
03:49:24,560 --> 03:49:26,560
Who's first name escapes me?

3121
03:49:28,560 --> 03:49:30,560
I hear there's an honorary plaque

3122
03:49:30,560 --> 03:49:32,560
commemorating him

3123
03:49:32,560 --> 03:49:34,560
within the lodge.

3124
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:36,560
Lodge?

3125
03:49:36,560 --> 03:49:37,560
Big guy.

3126
03:49:37,560 --> 03:49:39,560
Boring some quality time.

3127
03:49:39,560 --> 03:49:42,560
The greatest gift I can bestow upon you

3128
03:49:42,560 --> 03:49:44,560
as your former principal

3129
03:49:44,560 --> 03:49:46,560
is a word of advice.

3130
03:49:46,560 --> 03:49:48,560
Join the order

3131
03:49:48,560 --> 03:49:50,560
of the harvest moon at any cost.

3132
03:49:50,560 --> 03:49:52,560
Within the lodge

3133
03:49:52,560 --> 03:49:54,560
lies your future.

3134
03:49:54,560 --> 03:49:56,560
And without

3135
03:49:56,560 --> 03:49:58,560
dust.

3136
03:50:02,560 --> 03:50:04,560
Why do you keep calling me big guy?

3137
03:50:04,560 --> 03:50:06,560
They sign of respect, lad.

3138
03:50:06,560 --> 03:50:08,560
As principal, my station is higher

3139
03:50:08,560 --> 03:50:10,560
than yours now.

3140
03:50:10,560 --> 03:50:12,560
But you never know what the future holds.

3141
03:50:12,560 --> 03:50:14,560
So you should always hedge your bets

3142
03:50:14,560 --> 03:50:16,560
and pay tribute

3143
03:50:16,560 --> 03:50:18,560
to your inferiors.

3144
03:50:18,560 --> 03:50:20,560
You know who will come to power.

3145
03:50:20,560 --> 03:50:22,560
Inferiors? Oh.

3146
03:50:22,560 --> 03:50:24,560
Even now, wheels sit behind the scenes.

3147
03:50:24,560 --> 03:50:26,560
For all I know, you might already be a member

3148
03:50:26,560 --> 03:50:28,560
of the order with access

3149
03:50:28,560 --> 03:50:30,560
to the lodge.

3150
03:50:30,560 --> 03:50:32,560
If that were the case, you'd be my superior

3151
03:50:32,560 --> 03:50:34,560
and I'd be all that much better off

3152
03:50:34,560 --> 03:50:36,560
having shown you respect

3153
03:50:36,560 --> 03:50:38,560
and spent some quality

3154
03:50:38,560 --> 03:50:40,560
time with you.

3155
03:50:42,560 --> 03:50:44,560
Quality time?

3156
03:50:54,560 --> 03:50:56,560
Myself, I tip a discipline

3157
03:50:56,560 --> 03:50:58,560
with love.

3158
03:50:58,560 --> 03:51:00,560
Oh, love!

3159
03:51:00,560 --> 03:51:02,560
Love can be such a warm

3160
03:51:02,560 --> 03:51:04,560
sharing experience.

3161
03:51:04,560 --> 03:51:06,560
After just a few sessions,

3162
03:51:06,560 --> 03:51:08,560
you'd stop this amnesia nonsense

3163
03:51:08,560 --> 03:51:10,560
and become a productive

3164
03:51:10,560 --> 03:51:12,560
member of society.

3165
03:51:12,560 --> 03:51:14,560
Oh, love!

3166
03:51:16,560 --> 03:51:18,560
Okay.

3167
03:51:18,560 --> 03:51:20,560
Big guy,

3168
03:51:20,560 --> 03:51:22,560
boring some quality time.

3169
03:51:24,560 --> 03:51:26,560
Drop in again soon.

3170
03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:28,560
Adult education is

3171
03:51:28,560 --> 03:51:30,560
a wonderful thing

3172
03:51:30,560 --> 03:51:32,560
as is adult quality

3173
03:51:32,560 --> 03:51:34,560
time.

3174
03:51:34,560 --> 03:51:36,560
I want some quality time.

3175
03:51:36,560 --> 03:51:38,560
Last protected fire alarm.

3176
03:51:38,560 --> 03:51:40,560
Will not let you use

3177
03:51:40,560 --> 03:51:42,560
the fire alarm.

3178
03:51:42,560 --> 03:51:44,560
Drinking fountain doesn't work.

3179
03:51:48,560 --> 03:51:50,560
These lockers are riddled with inexplicable

3180
03:51:50,560 --> 03:51:52,560
stains and dent.

3181
03:51:52,560 --> 03:51:54,560
Door is locked.

3182
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:56,560
Uh-huh.

3183
03:52:04,560 --> 03:52:06,560
The children look stunned and zombified.

3184
03:52:10,560 --> 03:52:12,560
Even the paper cutouts look stunned

3185
03:52:12,560 --> 03:52:14,560
and zombified.

3186
03:52:14,560 --> 03:52:16,560
Oh, I don't need to go back in.

3187
03:52:16,560 --> 03:52:18,560
My goodness.

3188
03:52:18,560 --> 03:52:20,560
Class, this is Steven.

3189
03:52:20,560 --> 03:52:22,560
He used to be a student

3190
03:52:22,560 --> 03:52:24,560
here at Gean Memorial.

3191
03:52:24,560 --> 03:52:26,560
Say hello, class.

3192
03:52:26,560 --> 03:52:28,560
They're reticent.

3193
03:52:28,560 --> 03:52:30,560
The educator's greatest problem

3194
03:52:30,560 --> 03:52:32,560
today is the apathy of the students.

3195
03:52:32,560 --> 03:52:34,560
What's wrong with there?

3196
03:52:34,560 --> 03:52:36,560
It.

3197
03:52:36,560 --> 03:52:38,560
I can tell you in one word, Steven.

3198
03:52:38,560 --> 03:52:40,560
Discipline.

3199
03:52:40,560 --> 03:52:42,560
Goodness, you weren't a sulky bear.

3200
03:52:42,560 --> 03:52:44,560
You were always a smiley bear.

3201
03:52:44,560 --> 03:52:46,560
Then...

3202
03:52:46,560 --> 03:52:48,560
You remember me?

3203
03:52:48,560 --> 03:52:50,560
Not as such.

3204
03:52:50,560 --> 03:52:52,560
So many pupils, Steven.

3205
03:52:52,560 --> 03:52:54,560
They come and they go.

3206
03:52:54,560 --> 03:52:56,560
But I can always spot those who are nice boys.

3207
03:52:56,560 --> 03:52:58,560
You can tell from the forehead.

3208
03:52:58,560 --> 03:53:00,560
The lobes, right, class?

3209
03:53:00,560 --> 03:53:02,560
I'm glad you stopped by, Steven.

3210
03:53:02,560 --> 03:53:04,560
Would you care to say a few words to the class

3211
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:06,560
about civic responsibility?

3212
03:53:06,560 --> 03:53:08,560
Not really.

3213
03:53:08,560 --> 03:53:10,560
I was just passing through.

3214
03:53:10,560 --> 03:53:12,560
But you must, Steven.

3215
03:53:12,560 --> 03:53:14,560
A positive role model might be just the thing

3216
03:53:14,560 --> 03:53:16,560
to inspire these little monsters.

3217
03:53:16,560 --> 03:53:18,560
Steven, have you any questions for me?

3218
03:53:18,560 --> 03:53:20,560
Or shall I continue with class?

3219
03:53:22,560 --> 03:53:24,560
Yes, I do.

3220
03:53:26,560 --> 03:53:28,560
Harvest.

3221
03:53:28,560 --> 03:53:30,560
You tell me anything about the harvest.

3222
03:53:30,560 --> 03:53:32,560
Harvest was founded by the order

3223
03:53:32,560 --> 03:53:34,560
of the Harvest Moon about 100 years ago.

3224
03:53:34,560 --> 03:53:36,560
For what purpose?

3225
03:53:36,560 --> 03:53:38,560
Why, I'm sure you'd have to ask them.

3226
03:53:38,560 --> 03:53:40,560
You'll find the members of the order at the lodge.

3227
03:53:40,560 --> 03:53:42,560
Dang!

3228
03:53:42,560 --> 03:53:44,560
Uh...

3229
03:53:44,560 --> 03:53:46,560
Lodge.

3230
03:54:04,560 --> 03:54:06,560
Why is everyone so...

3231
03:54:06,560 --> 03:54:08,560
Okay!

3232
03:54:08,560 --> 03:54:10,560
And at some point, should I wait?

3233
03:54:20,560 --> 03:54:22,560
A baseball bat!

3234
03:54:38,560 --> 03:54:40,560
If an A-bomb hits,

3235
03:54:40,560 --> 03:54:42,560
what good is it going to do

3236
03:54:42,560 --> 03:54:44,560
to duck and cover?

3237
03:54:52,560 --> 03:54:54,560
Okay, that's fine.

3238
03:54:54,560 --> 03:54:56,560
Okay, that's fine.

3239
03:55:14,560 --> 03:55:16,560
Is this why...

3240
03:55:16,560 --> 03:55:18,560
Yeah, is this why we had memory loss?

3241
03:55:24,560 --> 03:55:26,560
I was like, oh, this is fine!

3242
03:55:26,560 --> 03:55:28,560
And then I saw the blood and I was like,

3243
03:55:28,560 --> 03:55:30,560
this is not fine anymore.

3244
03:55:30,560 --> 03:55:32,560
Don't buy any time, Steven.

3245
03:55:34,560 --> 03:55:36,560
Okay.

3246
03:55:36,560 --> 03:55:38,560
So you don't get to look

3247
03:55:38,560 --> 03:55:40,560
at what the kids look like? Okay.

3248
03:55:44,560 --> 03:55:46,560
Okay.

3249
03:55:46,560 --> 03:55:48,560
Where else did I not go yet?

3250
03:55:48,560 --> 03:55:50,560
Shad's...

3251
03:55:50,560 --> 03:55:52,560
Shady, sorry.

3252
03:55:52,560 --> 03:55:54,560
I was reading it wrong.

3253
03:55:54,560 --> 03:55:56,560
Shady...

3254
03:55:56,560 --> 03:55:58,560
I was reading it wrong.

3255
03:55:58,560 --> 03:56:00,560
Shady...

3256
03:56:00,560 --> 03:56:02,560
Shady...

3257
03:56:02,560 --> 03:56:04,560
Shady...

3258
03:56:04,560 --> 03:56:06,560
Shady...

3259
03:56:06,560 --> 03:56:08,560
Shady...

3260
03:56:08,560 --> 03:56:10,560
Shady...

3261
03:56:10,560 --> 03:56:12,560
Shady...

3262
03:56:12,560 --> 03:56:14,560
Shady...

3263
03:56:14,560 --> 03:56:16,560
I was reading it wrong. Shady...

3264
03:56:16,560 --> 03:56:18,560
Memorial?

3265
03:56:18,560 --> 03:56:20,560
Those volts of candles

3266
03:56:20,560 --> 03:56:22,560
have been lit by many well-wishers

3267
03:56:22,560 --> 03:56:24,560
for the dead or well-wishers

3268
03:56:24,560 --> 03:56:26,560
with a lot of matches.

3269
03:56:26,560 --> 03:56:28,560
Those geared to us

3270
03:56:28,560 --> 03:56:30,560
who have passed recently.

3271
03:56:30,560 --> 03:56:32,560
Jonathan A. Reigncliff.

3272
03:56:32,560 --> 03:56:34,560
Kedro for this week's funerary event.

3273
03:56:34,560 --> 03:56:36,560
I mean, this is an okay place

3274
03:56:36,560 --> 03:56:38,560
to have the wedding.

3275
03:56:40,560 --> 03:56:42,560
Oh!

3276
03:56:44,560 --> 03:56:46,560
It counters this new tube of astraglue.

3277
03:56:54,560 --> 03:56:56,560
I wanted it.

3278
03:56:56,560 --> 03:56:58,560
Security.

3279
03:56:58,560 --> 03:57:00,560
Like what? Money?

3280
03:57:00,560 --> 03:57:02,560
I'm afraid that's not good enough.

3281
03:57:02,560 --> 03:57:04,560
I need that glue for my work.

3282
03:57:04,560 --> 03:57:06,560
You must present me with something

3283
03:57:06,560 --> 03:57:08,560
significant if you'd have me

3284
03:57:08,560 --> 03:57:10,560
part with it.

3285
03:57:10,560 --> 03:57:12,560
Like tampons?

3286
03:57:12,560 --> 03:57:14,560
I am Daniel Moynihan.

3287
03:57:14,560 --> 03:57:16,560
Mortician and proprietor

3288
03:57:16,560 --> 03:57:18,560
of the wayward hotel.

3289
03:57:18,560 --> 03:57:20,560
Most people ask me why I don't

3290
03:57:20,560 --> 03:57:22,560
remember their names.

3291
03:57:22,560 --> 03:57:24,560
Well, you always were a kidder.

3292
03:57:24,560 --> 03:57:26,560
Another kidder!

3293
03:57:54,560 --> 03:57:56,560
What losses?

3294
03:58:00,560 --> 03:58:02,560
Ah, not the PTA.

3295
03:58:24,560 --> 03:58:26,560
Okay, that sounds suspicious.

3296
03:58:44,560 --> 03:58:46,560
Okay.

3297
03:58:48,560 --> 03:58:50,560
Oh, Order of the Harvest Moon?

3298
03:58:50,560 --> 03:58:52,560
You're a part of it, isn't it?

3299
03:58:54,560 --> 03:58:56,560
Mm-hmm.

3300
03:59:04,560 --> 03:59:06,560
Mm-hmm.

3301
03:59:12,560 --> 03:59:14,560
Thank you, Cole. Hi for housing us in the basement.

3302
03:59:16,560 --> 03:59:18,560
Do they work at the meat plant?

3303
03:59:18,560 --> 03:59:20,560
I always said small animals, right?

3304
03:59:24,560 --> 03:59:26,560
Yeah.

3305
03:59:46,560 --> 03:59:48,560
When they ran out of cats.

3306
03:59:48,560 --> 03:59:50,560
There was a lot of cats there.

3307
03:59:50,560 --> 03:59:52,560
A bake sale?

3308
03:59:54,560 --> 03:59:56,560
Oh wait, I already said that.

3309
04:00:00,560 --> 04:00:02,560
Losses?

3310
04:00:20,560 --> 04:00:22,560
The dead?

3311
04:00:50,560 --> 04:00:52,560
That's why I put some supplies in barrels.

3312
04:01:16,560 --> 04:01:18,560
Wayward Hotel.

3313
04:01:20,560 --> 04:01:22,560
I do my best to accommodate any hobo

3314
04:01:22,560 --> 04:01:24,560
who straggles into town vacancies permitting.

3315
04:01:30,560 --> 04:01:32,560
Very charitable of you.

3316
04:01:32,560 --> 04:01:34,560
Thank you.

3317
04:01:48,560 --> 04:01:50,560
Can I talk about the Wayward Hotel again?

3318
04:01:54,560 --> 04:01:56,560
Are the guys who dropped dead staying at your hotel?

3319
04:02:02,560 --> 04:02:04,560
I can't remember every little

3320
04:02:04,560 --> 04:02:06,560
Is he lying?

3321
04:02:12,560 --> 04:02:14,560
Why is everyone saying juicy?

3322
04:02:28,560 --> 04:02:30,560
Bye.

3323
04:02:32,560 --> 04:02:34,560
I look

3324
04:02:40,560 --> 04:02:42,560
Very nasty-looking sink.

3325
04:02:42,560 --> 04:02:44,560
The fan-wearing blades barely stir the stench-laden air.

3326
04:02:48,560 --> 04:02:50,560
The needle lies on 33 degrees Fahrenheit.

3327
04:02:54,560 --> 04:02:56,560
This membered organ,

3328
04:02:56,560 --> 04:02:58,560
which was never meant to pump a meldehyde.

3329
04:02:58,560 --> 04:03:00,560
Is there anything else in here?

3330
04:03:14,560 --> 04:03:16,560
Alright, this isn't salty at all.

3331
04:03:16,560 --> 04:03:18,560
A lectern for a priest.

3332
04:03:18,560 --> 04:03:20,560
A hauntingly beautiful stained glass window

3333
04:03:20,560 --> 04:03:22,560
in which a man holds a scythe

3334
04:03:22,560 --> 04:03:24,560
in one hand and some ethereal power in the other.

3335
04:03:28,560 --> 04:03:30,560
A saint kneels before a shepherd.

3336
04:03:30,560 --> 04:03:32,560
You jubilantly terrified.

3337
04:03:36,560 --> 04:03:38,560
Is there like a secret thing here?

3338
04:03:46,560 --> 04:03:48,560
We are in a cult

3339
04:03:48,560 --> 04:03:50,560
and it's probably run by

3340
04:03:50,560 --> 04:03:52,560
evil people.

3341
04:03:54,560 --> 04:03:56,560
Cemetery.

3342
04:03:58,560 --> 04:04:00,560
I guess we go in.

3343
04:04:04,560 --> 04:04:06,560
The headstone of this grave

3344
04:04:06,560 --> 04:04:08,560
site reads Jonathan

3345
04:04:08,560 --> 04:04:10,560
Jonathan A. Ryan Co-

3346
04:04:10,560 --> 04:04:12,560
Let's save.

3347
04:04:28,560 --> 04:04:30,560
Here lies Boxcar Willie.

3348
04:04:32,560 --> 04:04:34,560
Air reeks of fresh soil manure.

3349
04:04:36,560 --> 04:04:38,560
Two years in harvest was

3350
04:04:38,560 --> 04:04:40,560
Two years in harvest was too long.

3351
04:04:40,560 --> 04:04:42,560
Fear not in death.

3352
04:04:42,560 --> 04:04:44,560
Montages.

3353
04:04:44,560 --> 04:04:46,560
Scripture in the headstone has faded.

3354
04:04:48,560 --> 04:04:50,560
November 27th, 1948.

3355
04:04:50,560 --> 04:04:52,560
Another unknown visitor.

3356
04:04:52,560 --> 04:04:54,560
This tombstone is unmarked.

3357
04:04:58,560 --> 04:05:00,560
You don't know how to use a shovel.

3358
04:05:02,560 --> 04:05:04,560
Another resting place amongst

3359
04:05:04,560 --> 04:05:06,560
the graves.

3360
04:05:12,560 --> 04:05:14,560
What's here?

3361
04:05:14,560 --> 04:05:16,560
Marvel store have been sealed shut.

3362
04:05:22,560 --> 04:05:24,560
I don't know.

3363
04:05:30,560 --> 04:05:32,560
Wrong grave?

3364
04:05:36,560 --> 04:05:38,560
Well, that didn't work.

3365
04:05:38,560 --> 04:05:40,560
Okay.

3366
04:05:40,560 --> 04:05:42,560
Never mind then.

3367
04:05:42,560 --> 04:05:44,560
Is there anything else?

3368
04:05:50,560 --> 04:05:52,560
Is there anything else?

3369
04:05:54,560 --> 04:05:56,560
Maybe the diner?

3370
04:05:56,560 --> 04:05:58,560
Anything in the diner?

3371
04:06:12,560 --> 04:06:14,560
Anything in the diner?

3372
04:06:22,560 --> 04:06:24,560
Oh, it's just me, right?

3373
04:06:24,560 --> 04:06:26,560
And

3374
04:06:26,560 --> 04:06:28,560
does not let her customers

3375
04:06:28,560 --> 04:06:30,560
behind the counter.

3376
04:06:32,560 --> 04:06:34,560
Bye, bye.

3377
04:06:34,560 --> 04:06:36,560
Okay, that's a little eerie.

3378
04:06:36,560 --> 04:06:38,560
Mr. Johnson's house.

3379
04:06:38,560 --> 04:06:40,560
Johnson?

3380
04:06:54,560 --> 04:06:56,560
Oh, right here.

3381
04:07:24,560 --> 04:07:26,560
Oh, okay.

3382
04:07:32,560 --> 04:07:34,560
Okay.

3383
04:07:36,560 --> 04:07:38,560
Kidder count.

3384
04:07:54,560 --> 04:07:56,560
Okay, Edna.

3385
04:08:00,560 --> 04:08:02,560
What?

3386
04:08:24,560 --> 04:08:26,560
She needs a good, hard pain.

3387
04:08:26,560 --> 04:08:28,560
What?

3388
04:08:36,560 --> 04:08:38,560
I can see why she doesn't like you.

3389
04:08:40,560 --> 04:08:42,560
I see why she doesn't like you.

3390
04:08:42,560 --> 04:08:44,560
You're not in this for love.

3391
04:08:44,560 --> 04:08:46,560
You're in this for other things.

3392
04:08:46,560 --> 04:08:48,560
How dare you?

3393
04:08:54,560 --> 04:08:56,560
I...

3394
04:09:02,560 --> 04:09:04,560
No, he's not in this for love.

3395
04:09:04,560 --> 04:09:06,560
I can tell.

3396
04:09:06,560 --> 04:09:08,560
After all, some pies are here because they're in love, right?

3397
04:09:10,560 --> 04:09:12,560
Well, tell me more about the diner.

3398
04:09:24,560 --> 04:09:26,560
Okay.

3399
04:09:40,560 --> 04:09:42,560
Okay, a little bit of whiplash there.

3400
04:09:48,560 --> 04:09:50,560
That's a little bit of whiplash there.

3401
04:09:50,560 --> 04:09:52,560
How Stephanie?

3402
04:09:52,560 --> 04:09:54,560
Oh, yeah, she's fine.

3403
04:09:56,560 --> 04:09:58,560
Can't we want both things?

3404
04:09:58,560 --> 04:10:00,560
Of course we can want both things.

3405
04:10:00,560 --> 04:10:02,560
But you have to want both things.

3406
04:10:02,560 --> 04:10:04,560
You can't just have...

3407
04:10:04,560 --> 04:10:06,560
the other thing.

3408
04:10:06,560 --> 04:10:08,560
Because without love, it's meaningless, right?

3409
04:10:14,560 --> 04:10:16,560
Speaking of Stephanie,

3410
04:10:16,560 --> 04:10:18,560
I still haven't gotten an invitation to the wedding yet.

3411
04:10:18,560 --> 04:10:20,560
I don't have anything to do with that.

3412
04:10:22,560 --> 04:10:24,560
That's okay.

3413
04:10:24,560 --> 04:10:26,560
Personally, I'd prefer a pass to the honeymoon.

3414
04:10:28,560 --> 04:10:30,560
A pass?

3415
04:10:30,560 --> 04:10:32,560
I could use the backseat of my tucker for the

3416
04:10:32,560 --> 04:10:34,560
maiden voyage.

3417
04:10:34,560 --> 04:10:36,560
It's plenty big.

3418
04:10:36,560 --> 04:10:38,560
Believe you me.

3419
04:10:38,560 --> 04:10:40,560
I'd drive you around.

3420
04:10:40,560 --> 04:10:42,560
And I wouldn't look in the backseat.

3421
04:10:42,560 --> 04:10:44,560
I guarantee it.

3422
04:10:44,560 --> 04:10:46,560
Though, if you'd like to come up front

3423
04:10:46,560 --> 04:10:48,560
and take the wheel a while,

3424
04:10:48,560 --> 04:10:50,560
I wouldn't say name.

3425
04:10:50,560 --> 04:10:52,560
Mimosa!

3426
04:10:54,560 --> 04:10:56,560
Also, this man is not allowed

3427
04:10:56,560 --> 04:10:58,560
at our honeymoon!

3428
04:11:00,560 --> 04:11:02,560
Mimosa!

3429
04:11:02,560 --> 04:11:04,560
Welcome to the stream!

3430
04:11:04,560 --> 04:11:06,560
Welcome!

3431
04:11:08,560 --> 04:11:10,560
No, but no.

3432
04:11:10,560 --> 04:11:12,560
I don't want anyone at our honeymoon Senpai.

3433
04:11:12,560 --> 04:11:14,560
Our honeymoon is very lovely

3434
04:11:14,560 --> 04:11:16,560
and romantic, okay?

3435
04:11:16,560 --> 04:11:18,560
This...

3436
04:11:18,560 --> 04:11:20,560
That is not romantic!

3437
04:11:20,560 --> 04:11:22,560
Mimosa, welcome to the stream!

3438
04:11:22,560 --> 04:11:24,560
Welcome!

3439
04:11:24,560 --> 04:11:26,560
Hello, Raiders!

3440
04:11:26,560 --> 04:11:28,560
My name is

3441
04:11:28,560 --> 04:11:30,560
Mercy Modis

3442
04:11:30,560 --> 04:11:32,560
from Gen 1...

3443
04:11:32,560 --> 04:11:34,560
No, from

3444
04:11:34,560 --> 04:11:36,560
Viewers! Gen 1

3445
04:11:36,560 --> 04:11:38,560
Indulge! Welcome!

3446
04:11:38,560 --> 04:11:40,560
Right now, we are playing!

3447
04:11:44,560 --> 04:11:46,560
I'm sorry.

3448
04:11:46,560 --> 04:11:48,560
I blanked out on the name for a second.

3449
04:11:48,560 --> 04:11:50,560
Welcome, Mimosa!

3450
04:11:50,560 --> 04:11:52,560
How was the stream?

3451
04:11:52,560 --> 04:11:54,560
What were you playing?

3452
04:12:00,560 --> 04:12:02,560
Sorry, I totally forgot.

3453
04:12:02,560 --> 04:12:04,560
I blanked out on the name.

3454
04:12:04,560 --> 04:12:06,560
No, I don't want to be...

3455
04:12:06,560 --> 04:12:08,560
Our honeymoon can't be here!

3456
04:12:08,560 --> 04:12:10,560
I remember playing that game.

3457
04:12:10,560 --> 04:12:12,560
I remember playing

3458
04:12:12,560 --> 04:12:14,560
Bunny Garden. It was real...

3459
04:12:14,560 --> 04:12:16,560
It was real fun. Did you like it?

3460
04:12:16,560 --> 04:12:18,560
Are you liking it?

3461
04:12:22,560 --> 04:12:24,560
I forgot the order

3462
04:12:24,560 --> 04:12:26,560
which I had to do it.

3463
04:12:26,560 --> 04:12:28,560
Welcome, welcome! There might be some

3464
04:12:28,560 --> 04:12:30,560
such things in this game, so

3465
04:12:30,560 --> 04:12:32,560
if you're not into the such stuff

3466
04:12:32,560 --> 04:12:34,560
maybe close your ears.

3467
04:12:34,560 --> 04:12:36,560
Thank you, Mimosa!

3468
04:12:36,560 --> 04:12:38,560
I hope you had a good one. Are you heading to bed?

3469
04:12:42,560 --> 04:12:44,560
I saw a girl with green lace panties.

3470
04:12:44,560 --> 04:12:46,560
It was amazing.

3471
04:12:46,560 --> 04:12:48,560
Wait, I played a different Bunny Game!

3472
04:12:48,560 --> 04:12:50,560
Bunny Garden Game!

3473
04:12:50,560 --> 04:12:52,560
This one's the new one!

3474
04:12:52,560 --> 04:12:54,560
With the Bunny! Bunny Girls!

3475
04:12:54,560 --> 04:12:56,560
Real Bunny Girls!

3476
04:12:56,560 --> 04:12:58,560
Not anthropomorphic

3477
04:12:58,560 --> 04:13:00,560
Bunny Girls!

3478
04:13:00,560 --> 04:13:02,560
Like, you know...

3479
04:13:02,560 --> 04:13:04,560
Sexy Bunny Girls!

3480
04:13:12,560 --> 04:13:14,560
Huh?

3481
04:13:20,560 --> 04:13:22,560
Right? This one's the sexy one!

3482
04:13:22,560 --> 04:13:24,560
And you can gamble!

3483
04:13:24,560 --> 04:13:26,560
Right? This is the new one, right?

3484
04:13:26,560 --> 04:13:28,560
This is the one.

3485
04:13:28,560 --> 04:13:30,560
The other one's like Bunny Bunny!

3486
04:13:30,560 --> 04:13:32,560
Am I...

3487
04:13:32,560 --> 04:13:34,560
I thought it was Bunny Garden.

3488
04:13:34,560 --> 04:13:36,560
Was it called something else?

3489
04:13:38,560 --> 04:13:40,560
No, no, no!

3490
04:13:40,560 --> 04:13:42,560
Uh...

3491
04:13:44,560 --> 04:13:46,560
Give me a second. Bunny Garden...

3492
04:13:52,560 --> 04:13:54,560
Sorry, I mistaken the name!

3493
04:13:54,560 --> 04:13:56,560
Sorry, sorry, sorry! I mistaken the name!

3494
04:13:56,560 --> 04:13:58,560
The game I was playing was called

3495
04:13:58,560 --> 04:14:00,560
the Bunny Graveyard!

3496
04:14:02,560 --> 04:14:04,560
There was a bit of gardening in it!

3497
04:14:10,560 --> 04:14:12,560
Ha ha ha ha!

3498
04:14:14,560 --> 04:14:16,560
Ha ha ha ha!

3499
04:14:18,560 --> 04:14:20,560
There's a different location!

3500
04:14:20,560 --> 04:14:22,560
We did garden!

3501
04:14:22,560 --> 04:14:24,560
We did garden in there!

3502
04:14:28,560 --> 04:14:30,560
Graveyard Garden!

3503
04:14:30,560 --> 04:14:32,560
Same difference! They have dirt in them!

3504
04:14:32,560 --> 04:14:34,560
You know?

3505
04:14:38,560 --> 04:14:40,560
The same!

3506
04:14:40,560 --> 04:14:42,560
You still talked about sexy anthropomorphic bunnies!

3507
04:14:42,560 --> 04:14:44,560
Oh, no, no, no!

3508
04:14:44,560 --> 04:14:46,560
I meant like this one is anthropomorphic bunnies!

3509
04:14:46,560 --> 04:14:48,560
Bunny Garden, the other one,

3510
04:14:48,560 --> 04:14:50,560
is sexy bunnies!

3511
04:14:50,560 --> 04:14:52,560
Like Playboy bunnies!

3512
04:14:52,560 --> 04:14:54,560
But we don't say Playboy because we can get sued!

3513
04:14:54,560 --> 04:14:56,560
Ha ha ha ha!

3514
04:15:02,560 --> 04:15:04,560
But nice! Green panties!

3515
04:15:04,560 --> 04:15:06,560
I don't even think I have green panties!

3516
04:15:06,560 --> 04:15:08,560
What color are my panties?

3517
04:15:10,560 --> 04:15:12,560
No, they're bears! I forgot!

3518
04:15:12,560 --> 04:15:14,560
Yeah, they're bears! Ha ha ha ha ha!

3519
04:15:18,560 --> 04:15:20,560
Mercy, you kill me!

3520
04:15:20,560 --> 04:15:22,560
No...

3521
04:15:22,560 --> 04:15:24,560
No...

3522
04:15:24,560 --> 04:15:26,560
No...

3523
04:15:26,560 --> 04:15:28,560
Because Mimosa...

3524
04:15:28,560 --> 04:15:30,560
You slay!

3525
04:15:30,560 --> 04:15:32,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3526
04:15:32,560 --> 04:15:34,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3527
04:15:50,560 --> 04:15:52,560
Ah!

3528
04:15:52,560 --> 04:15:54,560
Look at me! Look at me, senpais!

3529
04:15:54,560 --> 04:15:56,560
I have ribs!

3530
04:15:56,560 --> 04:15:58,560
Right? I have ribs!

3531
04:16:00,560 --> 04:16:02,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3532
04:16:04,560 --> 04:16:06,560
Okay...

3533
04:16:06,560 --> 04:16:08,560
Don't...

3534
04:16:08,560 --> 04:16:10,560
Don't point out how long I've been wearing the same panties

3535
04:16:10,560 --> 04:16:12,560
for a doll!

3536
04:16:12,560 --> 04:16:14,560
Why are you keeping track anyways, huh?

3537
04:16:16,560 --> 04:16:18,560
We're gonna...

3538
04:16:18,560 --> 04:16:20,560
Shut up!

3539
04:16:22,560 --> 04:16:24,560
Yeah, I got the ribs!

3540
04:16:24,560 --> 04:16:26,560
So now...

3541
04:16:26,560 --> 04:16:28,560
Clearly!

3542
04:16:28,560 --> 04:16:30,560
Clearly, Mimosa

3543
04:16:30,560 --> 04:16:32,560
wants to be my best friend forever, right?

3544
04:16:32,560 --> 04:16:34,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3545
04:16:36,560 --> 04:16:38,560
Well, you did say you hadn't

3546
04:16:38,560 --> 04:16:40,560
showered in days openly.

3547
04:16:40,560 --> 04:16:42,560
Well, my water's not exactly

3548
04:16:42,560 --> 04:16:44,560
in...

3549
04:16:44,560 --> 04:16:46,560
proper condition.

3550
04:16:46,560 --> 04:16:48,560
And it was just yesterday!

3551
04:16:48,560 --> 04:16:50,560
I showered yesterday! It's fine!

3552
04:16:50,560 --> 04:16:52,560
I think...

3553
04:16:52,560 --> 04:16:54,560
Actually...

3554
04:16:58,560 --> 04:17:00,560
Call me!

3555
04:17:02,560 --> 04:17:04,560
Mimosa!

3556
04:17:04,560 --> 04:17:06,560
You can slide into my DMs

3557
04:17:06,560 --> 04:17:08,560
anytime, don't worry.

3558
04:17:12,560 --> 04:17:14,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3559
04:17:16,560 --> 04:17:18,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3560
04:17:20,560 --> 04:17:22,560
Listen, girls!

3561
04:17:22,560 --> 04:17:24,560
The... the corporal girls, they don't...

3562
04:17:24,560 --> 04:17:26,560
They don't have...

3563
04:17:26,560 --> 04:17:28,560
They don't get to go in the cage. They have...

3564
04:17:28,560 --> 04:17:30,560
free access.

3565
04:17:30,560 --> 04:17:32,560
Oh, they don't have to stay.

3566
04:17:32,560 --> 04:17:34,560
They can stay if they want.

3567
04:17:34,560 --> 04:17:36,560
They have free access to come and go as they please.

3568
04:17:36,560 --> 04:17:38,560
Yeah.

3569
04:17:38,560 --> 04:17:40,560
Yeah.

3570
04:17:40,560 --> 04:17:42,560
Mm-hmm.

3571
04:17:42,560 --> 04:17:44,560
I can't believe there is work.

3572
04:17:44,560 --> 04:17:46,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3573
04:17:46,560 --> 04:17:48,560
Discrimination!

3574
04:17:48,560 --> 04:17:50,560
Don't get me wrong, Senpai!

3575
04:17:50,560 --> 04:17:52,560
Don't get me wrong!

3576
04:17:52,560 --> 04:17:54,560
It's not like I don't trust you,

3577
04:17:54,560 --> 04:17:56,560
but there's many times

3578
04:17:56,560 --> 04:17:58,560
in which I question the validity

3579
04:17:58,560 --> 04:18:00,560
of your words.

3580
04:18:00,560 --> 04:18:02,560
So that's why sometimes

3581
04:18:02,560 --> 04:18:04,560
the girls help me.

3582
04:18:04,560 --> 04:18:06,560
And then they help me clean up as well.

3583
04:18:06,560 --> 04:18:08,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3584
04:18:14,560 --> 04:18:16,560
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

3585
04:18:20,560 --> 04:18:22,560
Remember

3586
04:18:22,560 --> 04:18:24,560
when you didn't put

3587
04:18:24,560 --> 04:18:26,560
my Oshi mark in your name, Senpai?

3588
04:18:28,560 --> 04:18:30,560
Remember when you said

3589
04:18:30,560 --> 04:18:32,560
that you didn't love me?

3590
04:18:32,560 --> 04:18:34,560
There's so many moments like that,

3591
04:18:34,560 --> 04:18:36,560
and I always give second chances.

3592
04:18:36,560 --> 04:18:38,560
More than checking chances.

3593
04:18:38,560 --> 04:18:40,560
At this point, it seems to be like

3594
04:18:40,560 --> 04:18:42,560
my endless amount of chances.

3595
04:18:42,560 --> 04:18:44,560
I'm so nice!

3596
04:18:48,560 --> 04:18:50,560
I'm so nice!

3597
04:18:50,560 --> 04:18:52,560
And all this time,

3598
04:18:52,560 --> 04:18:54,560
what do I get?

3599
04:18:54,560 --> 04:18:56,560
Not even my Oshi mark in your name.

3600
04:19:00,560 --> 04:19:02,560
I am so nice.

3601
04:19:02,560 --> 04:19:04,560
I give you a television in your cage.

3602
04:19:04,560 --> 04:19:06,560
I give you one happy meal

3603
04:19:06,560 --> 04:19:08,560
to share with everyone.

3604
04:19:10,560 --> 04:19:12,560
I give you five minutes of free time

3605
04:19:12,560 --> 04:19:14,560
so you even get to have some

3606
04:19:14,560 --> 04:19:16,560
some fun in there.

3607
04:19:16,560 --> 04:19:18,560
Come on!

3608
04:19:20,560 --> 04:19:22,560
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

3609
04:19:24,560 --> 04:19:26,560
So, Senpai's.

3610
04:19:28,560 --> 04:19:30,560
Senpai, Senpai's.

3611
04:19:30,560 --> 04:19:32,560
Now that you have it,

3612
04:19:32,560 --> 04:19:34,560
you have to earn my trust again.

3613
04:19:34,560 --> 04:19:36,560
You have to earn my trust again.

3614
04:19:36,560 --> 04:19:38,560
Because if I see you next day

3615
04:19:38,560 --> 04:19:40,560
without my Oshi mark,

3616
04:19:40,560 --> 04:19:42,560
we're going to have a lot of serious talking.

3617
04:19:42,560 --> 04:19:44,560
And by serious talking, I mean

3618
04:19:44,560 --> 04:19:46,560
perhaps talking where

3619
04:19:46,560 --> 04:19:48,560
you are met by the end of a shovel.

3620
04:19:48,560 --> 04:19:50,560
The spade side.

3621
04:19:54,560 --> 04:19:56,560
All right.

3622
04:20:00,560 --> 04:20:02,560
All right.

3623
04:20:08,560 --> 04:20:10,560
So that's all.

3624
04:20:10,560 --> 04:20:12,560
No ifs, and buts, and besides.

3625
04:20:12,560 --> 04:20:14,560
Besides.

3626
04:20:14,560 --> 04:20:16,560
The girls know how to keep a secret.

3627
04:20:18,560 --> 04:20:20,560
And, okay.

3628
04:20:20,560 --> 04:20:22,560
And, and

3629
04:20:22,560 --> 04:20:24,560
the cage

3630
04:20:24,560 --> 04:20:26,560
and the basement is my place

3631
04:20:26,560 --> 04:20:28,560
and your place, okay?

3632
04:20:28,560 --> 04:20:30,560
It's our private sanctuary.

3633
04:20:30,560 --> 04:20:32,560
It's our private sanctuary.

3634
04:20:32,560 --> 04:20:34,560
I mean we'll also come for visits of course

3635
04:20:34,560 --> 04:20:36,560
but otherwise, it's our private sanctuary.

3636
04:20:38,560 --> 04:20:40,560
All right.

3637
04:20:40,560 --> 04:20:42,560
Okay.

3638
04:20:52,560 --> 04:20:54,560
It's our private sanctuary.

3639
04:20:54,560 --> 04:20:56,560
Although if mimosa wants to be called Senpai

3640
04:20:56,560 --> 04:20:58,560
then you know

3641
04:20:58,560 --> 04:21:00,560
she would have

3642
04:21:00,560 --> 04:21:02,560
to share the McDonald's meal too.

3643
04:21:02,560 --> 04:21:04,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3644
04:21:10,560 --> 04:21:13,880
And then we'll have a wedding all together!

3645
04:21:13,880 --> 04:21:15,560
Hahahahaha!

3646
04:21:15,560 --> 04:21:17,560
No!

3647
04:21:17,560 --> 04:21:20,560
Then special privileges it is.

3648
04:21:22,560 --> 04:21:24,560
It's tomorrow Happy Meal Day or Monday.

3649
04:21:24,560 --> 04:21:28,560
It's once a month and I've already given the Happy Meal.

3650
04:21:28,560 --> 04:21:31,560
Anyways, let's continue on this.

3651
04:21:31,560 --> 04:21:34,560
I don't want to know but we're going to ask about Tucker.

3652
04:21:37,560 --> 04:21:39,560
Heck of an automobile, isn't she?

3653
04:21:40,560 --> 04:21:45,560
Damn shame I have to sit out here and watch over her all the time.

3654
04:21:45,560 --> 04:21:50,560
But if I didn't, those stupid kids might scratch her up playing ball.

3655
04:21:55,560 --> 04:21:57,560
Can I take a look at it?

3656
04:22:11,560 --> 04:22:16,560
A few months back someone broke into my house, trying to get into the garage.

3657
04:22:16,560 --> 04:22:23,560
I had to gripe my car before the sheriff agreed to start the evening patrols and instigate the curfew.

3658
04:22:40,560 --> 04:23:02,560
Only 51 cars were made, including their prototype, before the company was forced to declare bankruptcy and cease all operations on March 3, 1949 due to negative publicity initiated by the news media.

3659
04:23:03,560 --> 04:23:04,560
Let's see.

3660
04:23:04,560 --> 04:23:13,560
A Securities Exchange Commission investigation heavily publicized stock fraud trial in which the allegations for proven baseless and led to full acquittal.

3661
04:23:13,560 --> 04:23:23,560
Tucker suspected that big three automakers, Mexican Senator Homer S. Ferguson had a role in the Tucker corporation's demise.

3662
04:23:24,560 --> 04:23:27,560
So what, they didn't like the car or something?

3663
04:23:28,560 --> 04:23:37,560
Alright, okay, so I guess this car is really rare and that's why it's expensive? Okay.

3664
04:23:39,560 --> 04:23:42,560
I mean, that's why he cares about it so much, got it.

3665
04:23:47,560 --> 04:23:48,560
Why now?

3666
04:23:49,560 --> 04:23:55,560
During the day, Mr. Johnson keeps watch over his precious 48 Tucker.

3667
04:23:58,560 --> 04:24:07,560
Sorry, Steve. Too tired to talk right now. I just gave the Tucker a tune up. I'll talk to you later.

3668
04:24:08,560 --> 04:24:09,560
Okay, bye.

3669
04:24:14,560 --> 04:24:16,560
Okay, so this is an expensive car.

3670
04:24:20,560 --> 04:24:23,560
Or, well, a car that's very...

3671
04:24:24,560 --> 04:24:25,560
Am I missing something?

3672
04:24:25,560 --> 04:24:28,560
Where do I get a screwdriver, some pie?

3673
04:24:28,560 --> 04:24:29,560
Pie.

3674
04:24:48,560 --> 04:24:57,560
It's during the day he sits out there, but when he goes to the diner, is the car, you know, car?

3675
04:24:59,560 --> 04:25:03,560
A screwdriver store, shut up.

3676
04:25:16,560 --> 04:25:17,560
Does my house have one?

3677
04:25:29,560 --> 04:25:34,560
I won't be able to get the screwdriver today or tomorrow.

3678
04:25:36,560 --> 04:25:37,560
But why not?

3679
04:25:41,560 --> 04:25:42,560
Why not?

3680
04:25:44,560 --> 04:25:46,560
You want this autograph?

3681
04:25:49,560 --> 04:25:51,560
Actually, never mind. You're a brat.

3682
04:25:59,560 --> 04:26:00,560
You're a brat.

3683
04:26:14,560 --> 04:26:15,560
Big whoopsie.

3684
04:26:16,560 --> 04:26:17,560
Never mind.

3685
04:26:25,560 --> 04:26:26,560
I guess?

3686
04:26:29,560 --> 04:26:34,560
Yeah, me didn't fucking care.

3687
04:26:35,560 --> 04:26:36,560
I guess?

3688
04:26:37,560 --> 04:26:39,560
Did I write out the completed lodge?

3689
04:26:43,560 --> 04:26:44,560
I guess?

3690
04:26:45,560 --> 04:26:51,560
If I'm done everything, I can go to the lodge and be like, here you go!

3691
04:26:52,560 --> 04:26:53,560
Right?

3692
04:26:59,560 --> 04:27:00,560
Oh, where is it?

3693
04:27:06,560 --> 04:27:08,560
Oh, right. Wrong game.

3694
04:27:10,560 --> 04:27:11,560
Here you go.

3695
04:27:16,560 --> 04:27:17,560
Yeah.

3696
04:27:28,560 --> 04:27:29,560
Assignment.

3697
04:27:32,560 --> 04:27:34,560
Oh, am I done for the day?

3698
04:27:41,560 --> 04:27:45,560
Look at the graphics, must have been like super great back then.

3699
04:27:53,560 --> 04:27:55,560
Why are you taking off your shirt, Steve?

3700
04:27:58,560 --> 04:28:03,560
Put on a shirt, you're gonna catch it cold.

3701
04:28:05,560 --> 04:28:08,560
That voice will always be hilarious.

3702
04:28:09,560 --> 04:28:12,560
Oh, yeah. Is this funny, Jill?

3703
04:28:14,560 --> 04:28:15,560
What's going on here?

3704
04:28:24,560 --> 04:28:25,560
Burger?

3705
04:28:28,560 --> 04:28:30,560
What's going on here?

3706
04:28:53,560 --> 04:28:55,560
I was like there was just a burger there.

3707
04:28:55,560 --> 04:28:58,560
Anything that's suddenly in my thingy?

3708
04:29:05,560 --> 04:29:08,560
Obviously some fat high school girl left it here.

3709
04:29:08,560 --> 04:29:09,560
What the...

3710
04:29:11,560 --> 04:29:12,560
Dipper dolls.

3711
04:29:14,560 --> 04:29:15,560
Anything else?

3712
04:29:15,560 --> 04:29:16,560
No.

3713
04:29:19,560 --> 04:29:21,560
What do you want, Steve?

3714
04:29:23,560 --> 04:29:24,560
Still sick, huh?

3715
04:29:26,560 --> 04:29:27,560
Alright.

3716
04:29:34,560 --> 04:29:35,560
You wanna go?

3717
04:29:38,560 --> 04:29:40,560
You wanna go, little bro?

3718
04:29:46,560 --> 04:29:47,560
Okay, dad.

3719
04:29:51,560 --> 04:29:53,560
Is he feeling better?

3720
04:29:55,560 --> 04:29:59,560
You know what? Fuck you.

3721
04:30:01,560 --> 04:30:02,560
Goodbye.

3722
04:30:03,560 --> 04:30:05,560
Aw, man, I wanna kick Kim in.

3723
04:30:10,560 --> 04:30:11,560
newborn baby.

3724
04:30:17,560 --> 04:30:18,560
Dad?

3725
04:30:18,560 --> 04:30:19,560
Dad?

3726
04:30:29,560 --> 04:30:30,560
Is there anything else?

3727
04:30:31,560 --> 04:30:33,560
Cookies? More cookies.

3728
04:30:39,560 --> 04:30:41,560
You forgot to have fun with mom yesterday.

3729
04:30:43,560 --> 04:30:44,560
So...

3730
04:30:48,560 --> 04:30:51,560
You want me to fuck mom?

3731
04:30:52,560 --> 04:30:55,560
Is that what you're saying? To do my ma'am?

3732
04:30:59,560 --> 04:31:01,560
I think I got a paper yesterday.

3733
04:31:09,560 --> 04:31:11,560
I think I have a paper from yesterday.

3734
04:31:12,560 --> 04:31:15,560
Yeah, I have a paper from yesterday.

3735
04:31:15,560 --> 04:31:18,560
Oh, hi. What? The game loves you!

3736
04:31:21,560 --> 04:31:23,560
See, she's like naughty words.

3737
04:31:23,560 --> 04:31:26,560
So I just put in a lot of naughty words, okay? Here.

3738
04:31:30,560 --> 04:31:31,560
See?

3739
04:31:31,560 --> 04:31:33,560
And not me! The game says it.

3740
04:31:45,560 --> 04:31:50,560
See? See, it's not me! The game says so.

3741
04:32:01,560 --> 04:32:04,560
Okay, hold on. I got your paper, boy.

3742
04:32:05,560 --> 04:32:07,560
There now. See how easy it is?

3743
04:32:08,560 --> 04:32:12,560
Things are so much better between us when you remember the paper in the morning.

3744
04:32:12,560 --> 04:32:14,560
And let's keep it that way.

3745
04:32:14,560 --> 04:32:17,560
I feel like this kid's gonna grab a gun at me or something.

3746
04:32:17,560 --> 04:32:19,560
Or stab me.

3747
04:32:28,560 --> 04:32:30,560
I didn't think that would happen.

3748
04:32:32,560 --> 04:32:35,560
I didn't think it would happen, but it did!

3749
04:32:41,560 --> 04:32:43,560
I knew it!

3750
04:32:44,560 --> 04:32:46,560
I knew it was strapped!

3751
04:32:48,560 --> 04:32:50,560
I knew it!

3752
04:32:53,560 --> 04:32:55,560
I knew it!

3753
04:33:05,560 --> 04:33:07,560
I knew it!

3754
04:33:10,560 --> 04:33:13,560
Can I punch him to death though? Is that a possibility?

3755
04:33:15,560 --> 04:33:18,560
I don't want to do this, but...

3756
04:33:21,560 --> 04:33:23,560
No, okay. It's only an outside thing.

3757
04:33:27,560 --> 04:33:30,560
It's possible, but very difficult.

3758
04:33:37,560 --> 04:33:40,560
It's just a really long time of punching.

3759
04:33:40,560 --> 04:33:42,560
The kid didn't even hesitate!

3760
04:33:44,560 --> 04:33:47,560
Can I kill the kid myself?

3761
04:33:50,560 --> 04:33:53,560
Whatever. We're gonna play a friendly relation for now.

3762
04:33:53,560 --> 04:33:55,560
For now.

3763
04:34:03,560 --> 04:34:07,560
Hey Steve, you've been doing a swell job putting the paper out in the morning.

3764
04:34:07,560 --> 04:34:11,560
You just keep doing that and we won't have any problems.

3765
04:34:11,560 --> 04:34:14,560
Yeah, yeah, whatever kid.

3766
04:34:19,560 --> 04:34:22,560
Where should I go to first? The lodge, right?

3767
04:34:31,560 --> 04:34:33,560
Yeah, I guess.

3768
04:34:34,560 --> 04:34:36,560
Yeah, I want to know what you know.

3769
04:34:42,560 --> 04:34:44,560
Okay.

3770
04:34:52,560 --> 04:34:54,560
Yeah, what kind of tasks?

3771
04:34:54,560 --> 04:34:56,560
Minor pranks!

3772
04:35:11,560 --> 04:35:15,560
There is, in harvest, a man named Mr. Johnson.

3773
04:35:15,560 --> 04:35:20,560
He owns a Tucker. It is his pride and joy.

3774
04:35:20,560 --> 04:35:24,560
I should like you to put a scratch in it.

3775
04:35:24,560 --> 04:35:26,560
A scratch? That's all?

3776
04:35:26,560 --> 04:35:29,560
As I said, a minor prank.

3777
04:35:29,560 --> 04:35:33,560
Mind you, you're not to damage the vehicle.

3778
04:35:33,560 --> 04:35:36,560
Really put a single scratch in it.

3779
04:35:36,560 --> 04:35:39,560
Once you have done so, return here.

3780
04:35:39,560 --> 04:35:43,560
And I shall give you your next task.

3781
04:35:43,560 --> 04:35:46,560
Okay, so I put a scratch on it.

3782
04:35:54,560 --> 04:35:56,560
Okay.

3783
04:36:02,560 --> 04:36:04,560
Do I...

3784
04:36:05,560 --> 04:36:07,560
What do I do? Okay.

3785
04:36:08,560 --> 04:36:11,560
If I do it right in front of him, he'll fucking kill me, right?

3786
04:36:11,560 --> 04:36:13,560
That's my guess.

3787
04:36:16,560 --> 04:36:18,560
What if...

3788
04:36:18,560 --> 04:36:21,560
What if I even use the scratch?

3789
04:36:21,560 --> 04:36:23,560
Shawty.

3790
04:36:24,560 --> 04:36:26,560
I want this.

3791
04:36:28,560 --> 04:36:30,560
I don't have money.

3792
04:36:31,560 --> 04:36:33,560
Hello, Steve. Care to buy anything?

3793
04:36:33,560 --> 04:36:35,560
No, thanks.

3794
04:36:37,560 --> 04:36:39,560
I'll be happy to help you.

3795
04:36:39,560 --> 04:36:41,560
Okay, thank you.

3796
04:36:44,560 --> 04:36:46,560
Oh, do I key a car?

3797
04:36:48,560 --> 04:36:50,560
Where can I get a key?

3798
04:37:01,560 --> 04:37:04,560
Maybe with the screwdriver? Where do I get the screwdriver?

3799
04:37:07,560 --> 04:37:09,560
Is he here?

3800
04:37:09,560 --> 04:37:11,560
He's not here.

3801
04:37:28,560 --> 04:37:30,560
Newspaper building.

3802
04:37:30,560 --> 04:37:32,560
Newspaper building.

3803
04:37:36,560 --> 04:37:38,560
Check the old man's garage.

3804
04:37:39,560 --> 04:37:41,560
This guy?

3805
04:37:45,560 --> 04:37:47,560
Sorry, Steve.

3806
04:37:48,560 --> 04:37:50,560
Bye now.

3807
04:37:54,560 --> 04:37:57,560
Can I go into his house?

3808
04:38:00,560 --> 04:38:02,560
Ew, okay.

3809
04:38:04,560 --> 04:38:06,560
I wonder if Stephanie has anything to say.

3810
04:38:06,560 --> 04:38:08,560
Oh, you're right.

3811
04:38:08,560 --> 04:38:10,560
I totally forgot about Stephanie.

3812
04:38:10,560 --> 04:38:13,560
I forgot! We have a wedding!

3813
04:38:18,560 --> 04:38:21,560
Yes, I... No, I haven't seen him.

3814
04:38:30,560 --> 04:38:32,560
Aw.

3815
04:38:40,560 --> 04:38:42,560
Aw.

3816
04:38:42,560 --> 04:38:44,560
Wait, no, I shouldn't say aww.

3817
04:38:44,560 --> 04:38:46,560
You, you, you are dirty!

3818
04:38:50,560 --> 04:38:52,560
Okay.

3819
04:38:52,560 --> 04:38:54,560
But also, fuck you.

3820
04:38:54,560 --> 04:38:56,560
Not like in...

3821
04:38:56,560 --> 04:38:58,560
You forgot about your wife? Sure did.

3822
04:38:58,560 --> 04:39:00,560
You moved the people?

3823
04:39:06,560 --> 04:39:08,560
He didn't move the people!

3824
04:39:16,560 --> 04:39:18,560
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

3825
04:39:18,560 --> 04:39:21,560
What did I say about the fucking people, huh?

3826
04:39:22,560 --> 04:39:24,560
You little shit.

3827
04:39:25,560 --> 04:39:29,560
I gave you one thing, and you didn't even do it!

3828
04:39:29,560 --> 04:39:31,560
Are you peeping caught?

3829
04:39:31,560 --> 04:39:34,560
Listen, I wanted to check if it was still there.

3830
04:39:34,560 --> 04:39:36,560
I wanted to check if it was still there.

3831
04:39:39,560 --> 04:39:42,560
Steve, I'm so glad you came back.

3832
04:39:42,560 --> 04:39:44,560
What have you been doing?

3833
04:39:44,560 --> 04:39:46,560
I visited the lodge.

3834
04:39:46,560 --> 04:39:48,560
Talked to the sergeant at arms there.

3835
04:39:49,560 --> 04:39:51,560
He knows that there's something out of whack here.

3836
04:39:51,560 --> 04:39:55,560
He told me if I wanted to find out what it is, I should join the lodge.

3837
04:39:55,560 --> 04:39:58,560
I've decided to join the lodge, Stephanie.

3838
04:39:58,560 --> 04:40:01,560
I think the answer to all our questions is inside.

3839
04:40:01,560 --> 04:40:03,560
That place.

3840
04:40:03,560 --> 04:40:05,560
It's so sinister.

3841
04:40:07,560 --> 04:40:09,560
Maybe, but I've got to join anyways.

3842
04:40:09,560 --> 04:40:11,560
You may be playing right into their hands.

3843
04:40:11,560 --> 04:40:13,560
Did you think of that?

3844
04:40:13,560 --> 04:40:16,560
Doesn't it seem like you're being hurted toward the lodge?

3845
04:40:16,560 --> 04:40:19,560
It's one of the things I hope to find out.

3846
04:40:19,560 --> 04:40:22,560
I hope finding out doesn't get you killed.

3847
04:40:24,560 --> 04:40:26,560
Come back and visit me soon.

3848
04:40:26,560 --> 04:40:28,560
Okay?

3849
04:40:28,560 --> 04:40:30,560
Okay.

3850
04:40:35,560 --> 04:40:37,560
Oi, that peephole!

3851
04:40:39,560 --> 04:40:41,560
Hole!

3852
04:40:49,560 --> 04:40:51,560
I guess.

3853
04:40:57,560 --> 04:40:59,560
Hmm.

3854
04:41:03,560 --> 04:41:06,560
You might want to be extra nice to Mr. Potson today.

3855
04:41:06,560 --> 04:41:09,560
Guess we're having a wedding at Mr. Moynihan's after all.

3856
04:41:11,560 --> 04:41:13,560
Give my regards to your parents.

3857
04:41:13,560 --> 04:41:15,560
Hmm.

3858
04:41:16,560 --> 04:41:17,560
You!

3859
04:41:17,560 --> 04:41:19,560
Hole!

3860
04:41:21,560 --> 04:41:23,560
My garage needs a new paint job.

3861
04:41:33,560 --> 04:41:35,560
I need a key. Where do I get a key?

3862
04:41:35,560 --> 04:41:37,560
I need a key.

3863
04:41:44,560 --> 04:41:49,560
Kittle, you brought me any of them girly picture books?

3864
04:41:49,560 --> 04:41:51,560
No, sorry.

3865
04:41:51,560 --> 04:41:53,560
Oh heck.

3866
04:41:53,560 --> 04:41:59,560
Why should you be any different from the sheriff or Mrs. Loomis?

3867
04:42:00,560 --> 04:42:08,560
Dave, I'd be right obliged if you could just seek Claire to bring in me just one of them books.

3868
04:42:08,560 --> 04:42:10,560
Believe me.

3869
04:42:10,560 --> 04:42:12,560
I already got your book!

3870
04:42:12,560 --> 04:42:16,560
I already got your one! What happened to the last one?

3871
04:42:19,560 --> 04:42:22,560
Wait, you're just going to let me look at it?

3872
04:42:23,560 --> 04:42:25,560
Can I do that again?

3873
04:42:26,560 --> 04:42:28,560
It just lets me?

3874
04:42:35,560 --> 04:42:37,560
It just lets me now?

3875
04:42:43,560 --> 04:42:45,560
Alright.

3876
04:42:45,560 --> 04:42:50,560
I'm a little nervous about it, but I guess it just does.

3877
04:42:56,560 --> 04:43:00,560
Alright, just don't mind me, officer.

3878
04:43:00,560 --> 04:43:03,560
I'm just going in.

3879
04:43:06,560 --> 04:43:09,560
I thought you were going to be burnt down already.

3880
04:43:15,560 --> 04:43:16,560
Bye.

3881
04:43:26,560 --> 04:43:31,560
Anything to stretch the car?

3882
04:43:31,560 --> 04:43:33,560
Have a shovel.

3883
04:43:48,560 --> 04:43:50,560
What's this?

3884
04:43:50,560 --> 04:43:54,560
A manhole key is stuck on the top of the manhole cover.

3885
04:43:54,560 --> 04:43:56,560
Can I take that?

3886
04:44:07,560 --> 04:44:09,560
Okay, bye.

3887
04:44:18,560 --> 04:44:23,560
Could you use the shovel and the manhole key? Why would I use the shovel and the manhole key?

3888
04:44:23,560 --> 04:44:25,560
Well, that didn't work.

3889
04:44:29,560 --> 04:44:32,560
Anything I can get to get it?

3890
04:44:34,560 --> 04:44:36,560
A lube.

3891
04:44:46,560 --> 04:44:49,560
Wait, was that not enough lube?

3892
04:44:50,560 --> 04:44:52,560
Oh, thank you.

3893
04:44:53,560 --> 04:44:55,560
Thank you.

3894
04:45:03,560 --> 04:45:06,560
Wait, what do you mean I thought it sense?

3895
04:45:12,560 --> 04:45:14,560
Wait, what?

3896
04:45:14,560 --> 04:45:16,560
Was that the game?

3897
04:45:23,560 --> 04:45:26,560
I do remember there's...

3898
04:45:26,560 --> 04:45:29,560
Oh, that seems dangerous. Hold on.

3899
04:45:29,560 --> 04:45:31,560
Let's grab this.

3900
04:45:48,560 --> 04:45:51,560
Was that all I had to do today?

3901
04:45:53,560 --> 04:45:55,560
Okay.

3902
04:45:59,560 --> 04:46:02,560
The rest of the grate is bolted to the damp floor.

3903
04:46:02,560 --> 04:46:06,560
Cold and moisture has formed along the surface of the wheel valve.

3904
04:46:06,560 --> 04:46:08,560
Can I use it?

3905
04:46:12,560 --> 04:46:14,560
What about this?

3906
04:46:14,560 --> 04:46:17,560
Small section of the hull has been resealed due to the water damage.

3907
04:46:23,560 --> 04:46:25,560
What about this?

3908
04:46:29,560 --> 04:46:31,560
Bolted.

3909
04:46:32,560 --> 04:46:34,560
Well, that didn't work.

3910
04:46:34,560 --> 04:46:36,560
Oh, man. Well, that didn't work.

3911
04:46:36,560 --> 04:46:38,560
Damn it.

3912
04:46:39,560 --> 04:46:41,560
What do I do now?

3913
04:46:48,560 --> 04:46:50,560
Is that just to go back up?

3914
04:46:50,560 --> 04:46:52,560
Okay.

3915
04:47:04,560 --> 04:47:07,560
Does that mean I have the brake in again?

3916
04:47:11,560 --> 04:47:13,560
Oh, man.

3917
04:47:21,560 --> 04:47:23,560
What do I need?

3918
04:47:23,560 --> 04:47:25,560
What do I need?

3919
04:47:29,560 --> 04:47:31,560
The walls down here?

3920
04:47:33,560 --> 04:47:36,560
Oh, there's a tiny indentation in the concrete.

3921
04:47:39,560 --> 04:47:41,560
Can I use the shovel?

3922
04:47:51,560 --> 04:47:53,560
Never mind, we got it.

3923
04:47:58,560 --> 04:48:00,560
Wow, wow!

3924
04:48:03,560 --> 04:48:06,560
Empty oil can slither before.

3925
04:48:07,560 --> 04:48:11,560
A large oil pan filled with lugs and bolts.

3926
04:48:15,560 --> 04:48:17,560
Oh.

3927
04:48:17,560 --> 04:48:19,560
Okay.

3928
04:48:20,560 --> 04:48:22,560
What's down here?

3929
04:48:30,560 --> 04:48:33,560
Mr. Johnson has a myriad of goodies on his tool bench.

3930
04:48:33,560 --> 04:48:35,560
Can I grab some?

3931
04:48:38,560 --> 04:48:40,560
Flashlight missing batteries.

3932
04:48:41,560 --> 04:48:45,560
Gas can similar to the model to the Postmaster's gas can.

3933
04:48:46,560 --> 04:48:48,560
Rubber mallet.

3934
04:48:49,560 --> 04:48:51,560
Ain't nothing but sawdust.

3935
04:48:51,560 --> 04:48:53,560
I was hoping he'd have a screwdriver.

3936
04:48:53,560 --> 04:48:55,560
Ducca ducca ducca ducca.

3937
04:48:56,560 --> 04:48:58,560
Oh, wait. No.

3938
04:48:58,560 --> 04:49:00,560
There it is.

3939
04:49:16,560 --> 04:49:18,560
Is there anything else here?

3940
04:49:21,560 --> 04:49:23,560
The edge to the side of the blowtorch reads,

3941
04:49:23,560 --> 04:49:25,560
Thinking of you, Edna.

3942
04:49:27,560 --> 04:49:29,560
How do I scratch this car?

3943
04:49:29,560 --> 04:49:32,560
Do I scratch it with the screwdriver?

3944
04:49:32,560 --> 04:49:34,560
Did it.

3945
04:49:34,560 --> 04:49:36,560
Get the fuck out of here.

3946
04:50:03,560 --> 04:50:05,560
Wait, can I cover the manhole?

3947
04:50:08,560 --> 04:50:10,560
Can I cover the manhole again?

3948
04:50:12,560 --> 04:50:14,560
Ah, man. Ah, man.

3949
04:50:15,560 --> 04:50:17,560
Yeah.

3950
04:50:17,560 --> 04:50:19,560
Fuck out of here.

3951
04:50:20,560 --> 04:50:22,560
Guess we go back to the lodge.

3952
04:50:26,560 --> 04:50:30,560
So, you have completed your first task.

3953
04:50:30,560 --> 04:50:32,560
Peace.

3954
04:50:32,560 --> 04:50:34,560
Now that you've scratched the ducca,

3955
04:50:34,560 --> 04:50:37,560
you may proceed to your second task.

3956
04:50:37,560 --> 04:50:41,560
You will steal a bolt of fabric from the fireman,

3957
04:50:41,560 --> 04:50:44,560
and bring it to me.

3958
04:50:50,560 --> 04:50:53,560
I see, then the lodge is comprised of thieves.

3959
04:50:53,560 --> 04:50:58,560
The human mind always seeks to categorize phenomena.

3960
04:50:59,560 --> 04:51:00,560
Okay.

3961
04:51:00,560 --> 04:51:02,560
Uh-huh.

3962
04:51:02,560 --> 04:51:04,560
Uh-huh.

3963
04:51:29,560 --> 04:51:31,560
Meet again, huh?

3964
04:51:49,560 --> 04:51:52,560
Okay, I guess it's my day over?

3965
04:51:54,560 --> 04:51:56,560
Right, he talks a lot.

3966
04:51:56,560 --> 04:51:58,560
I guess we have to get the mob now.

3967
04:51:59,560 --> 04:52:01,560
Oh, I like the fireman's.

3968
04:52:04,560 --> 04:52:05,560
Well, that was fast.

3969
04:52:05,560 --> 04:52:07,560
I saw that faster than I thought.

3970
04:52:17,560 --> 04:52:19,560
Way faster than I thought, actually.

3971
04:52:27,560 --> 04:52:31,560
I just don't know why he's always got to be shirtless.

3972
04:52:34,560 --> 04:52:38,560
Does he go to bed with his watch on to use some pie?

3973
04:52:40,560 --> 04:52:43,560
I have, like, a kamigachi watch.

3974
04:52:51,560 --> 04:52:52,560
Oh, you're right.

3975
04:52:52,560 --> 04:52:54,560
He sleeps in jeans.

3976
04:52:55,560 --> 04:52:58,560
Many people would sleep with their Apple Watches nowadays

3977
04:52:58,560 --> 04:53:00,560
because the tracks sleep.

3978
04:53:01,560 --> 04:53:03,560
That's a bit luxurious for me.

3979
04:53:03,560 --> 04:53:06,560
Taddle shoes with laces knotted together.

3980
04:53:06,560 --> 04:53:08,560
Taddle shoes.

3981
04:53:09,560 --> 04:53:10,560
What's that?

3982
04:53:10,560 --> 04:53:11,560
I don't know.

3983
04:53:11,560 --> 04:53:12,560
I don't know.

3984
04:53:12,560 --> 04:53:13,560
I don't know.

3985
04:53:13,560 --> 04:53:14,560
I don't know.

3986
04:53:14,560 --> 04:53:15,560
I don't know.

3987
04:53:15,560 --> 04:53:16,560
I don't know.

3988
04:53:16,560 --> 04:53:17,560
I don't know.

3989
04:53:17,560 --> 04:53:18,560
I don't know.

3990
04:53:18,560 --> 04:53:19,560
I don't know.

3991
04:53:19,560 --> 04:53:20,560
I don't know.

3992
04:53:20,560 --> 04:53:21,560
I don't know.

3993
04:53:22,560 --> 04:53:23,560
What's that?

3994
04:53:24,560 --> 04:53:26,560
Recently watered plastic plant.

3995
04:53:33,560 --> 04:53:34,560
Gotta get a paper.

3996
04:53:36,560 --> 04:53:37,560
Don't leave without it.

3997
04:53:37,560 --> 04:53:39,560
I said, don't leave without it.

3998
04:53:39,560 --> 04:53:40,560
Let's talk to your brother.

3999
04:53:41,560 --> 04:53:43,560
The dad feeling better?

4000
04:53:51,560 --> 04:53:53,560
Pot holder on her knees.

4001
04:53:53,560 --> 04:53:54,560
Reaching for him.

4002
04:53:54,560 --> 04:53:57,560
How can she do the stitches on him wearing those?

4003
04:53:57,560 --> 04:53:59,560
Wouldn't she slip?

4004
04:53:59,560 --> 04:54:00,560
Don't be silly.

4005
04:54:00,560 --> 04:54:01,560
She wouldn't do that.

4006
04:54:01,560 --> 04:54:02,560
Of course she'd slip.

4007
04:54:02,560 --> 04:54:04,560
Maybe that's why he's not getting better.

4008
04:54:04,560 --> 04:54:06,560
I heard that someone took Karen.

4009
04:54:06,560 --> 04:54:09,560
Little Miss Perfect was famous.

4010
04:54:09,560 --> 04:54:12,560
Gonna do a picture on her milk carton.

4011
04:54:12,560 --> 04:54:13,560
Yeah.

4012
04:54:13,560 --> 04:54:15,560
Well, I heard that Karen was gone.

4013
04:54:15,560 --> 04:54:18,560
So I went over to Miss Fitzgerald's house

4014
04:54:18,560 --> 04:54:21,560
and asked if I could play with Karen.

4015
04:54:23,560 --> 04:54:27,560
And I just stood there, you know, in the doorway

4016
04:54:27,560 --> 04:54:30,560
and cried and cried.

4017
04:54:30,560 --> 04:54:32,560
And I just stood there.

4018
04:54:32,560 --> 04:54:34,560
Punch my brother.

4019
04:54:34,560 --> 04:54:36,560
I don't know what take for her to stop.

4020
04:54:36,560 --> 04:54:38,560
But she didn't.

4021
04:54:40,560 --> 04:54:42,560
So I went inside and watched TV

4022
04:54:42,560 --> 04:54:44,560
because they've got color.

4023
04:54:44,560 --> 04:54:46,560
I thought you said you never heard of color.

4024
04:54:46,560 --> 04:54:49,560
Because she runs the diner and all.

4025
04:54:49,560 --> 04:54:52,560
And I've said she was feeling vulnerable.

4026
04:54:52,560 --> 04:54:56,560
So I asked her to fix me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

4027
04:54:56,560 --> 04:54:57,560
And she...

4028
04:54:57,560 --> 04:54:58,560
I'm gonna kill this kid.

4029
04:54:58,560 --> 04:55:00,560
Then I went into Karen's bedroom

4030
04:55:00,560 --> 04:55:02,560
and looked around for stuff I could take

4031
04:55:02,560 --> 04:55:05,560
while Edna was in the bathroom with the water running.

4032
04:55:05,560 --> 04:55:06,560
What?

4033
04:55:06,560 --> 04:55:09,560
But all that there was was pearl stuff.

4034
04:55:09,560 --> 04:55:11,560
So I came home.

4035
04:55:11,560 --> 04:55:14,560
But it was fun while it lasted.

4036
04:55:16,560 --> 04:55:18,560
You're evil.

4037
04:55:26,560 --> 04:55:28,560
Why is my brother off track?

4038
04:55:34,560 --> 04:55:36,560
Gosh, I wanna punch you.

4039
04:55:36,560 --> 04:55:39,560
Why can't I go over there and punch him myself?

4040
04:55:47,560 --> 04:55:49,560
Oops.

4041
04:55:55,560 --> 04:55:56,560
What?

4042
04:56:03,560 --> 04:56:05,560
What day did she disappear?

4043
04:56:10,560 --> 04:56:11,560
Tuesday.

4044
04:56:11,560 --> 04:56:12,560
Okay.

4045
04:56:17,560 --> 04:56:20,560
Wait, have I checked on my little sister yet?

4046
04:56:20,560 --> 04:56:22,560
Is my little sister even real?

4047
04:56:29,560 --> 04:56:31,560
What is wrong with that kid?

4048
04:56:31,560 --> 04:56:33,560
I hate kids.

4049
04:56:41,560 --> 04:56:43,560
Hold on.

4050
04:56:47,560 --> 04:56:48,560
What? Why?

4051
04:56:48,560 --> 04:56:50,560
Yeah, I did. Why?

4052
04:56:52,560 --> 04:56:54,560
What are we training?

4053
04:57:09,560 --> 04:57:11,560
Okay, sure. Take the sneakers.

4054
04:57:16,560 --> 04:57:18,560
Okay.

4055
04:57:31,560 --> 04:57:33,560
Don't you need the paper?

4056
04:57:33,560 --> 04:57:34,560
Paper?

4057
04:57:44,560 --> 04:57:45,560
Okay, you wanna go save Karen?

4058
04:57:45,560 --> 04:57:47,560
Yeah, I wanna go save Karen.

4059
04:57:47,560 --> 04:57:49,560
She seems like a sweet girl.

4060
04:57:50,560 --> 04:57:52,560
Wait a second.

4061
04:57:52,560 --> 04:57:55,560
Oh, so when did he talk about...

4062
04:57:55,560 --> 04:57:57,560
Okay, hold on.

4063
04:57:57,560 --> 04:57:59,560
Let's grab this.

4064
04:58:04,560 --> 04:58:07,560
Like, most security devices there

4065
04:58:07,560 --> 04:58:10,560
is usually more than one trap to stop intruders.

4066
04:58:10,560 --> 04:58:13,560
No!

4067
04:58:13,560 --> 04:58:15,560
When did I save?

4068
04:58:17,560 --> 04:58:19,560
What was the last time I saved?

4069
04:58:30,560 --> 04:58:32,560
Shit!

4070
04:58:34,560 --> 04:58:37,560
This is your first arrest, Steve.

4071
04:58:43,560 --> 04:58:45,560
Aw, man.

4072
04:58:58,560 --> 04:59:01,560
Next time I gotta save more.

4073
04:59:04,560 --> 04:59:07,560
Oh! It led me all the way here!

4074
04:59:09,560 --> 04:59:11,560
Son of a bitch.

4075
04:59:33,560 --> 04:59:35,560
Give me... Give me...

4076
04:59:35,560 --> 04:59:37,560
Right, go through the...

4077
04:59:40,560 --> 04:59:42,560
Wait a second.

4078
04:59:43,560 --> 04:59:45,560
A dependent poster?

4079
04:59:45,560 --> 04:59:49,560
Aided poster is a 1948 Sexiest Tomboy Award.

4080
04:59:49,560 --> 04:59:51,560
Tomboy, huh?

4081
04:59:57,560 --> 04:59:59,560
Did it.

4082
05:00:03,560 --> 05:00:05,560
No, no.

4083
05:00:29,560 --> 05:00:31,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4084
05:00:31,560 --> 05:00:34,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, you know what? Now we save again.

4085
05:00:42,200 --> 05:00:43,320
Oh my gosh.

4086
05:00:53,000 --> 05:00:59,640
Some pies. Are you saying that you like tomboy? Am I not tomboy enough for you?

4087
05:01:02,520 --> 05:01:03,560
More of you.

4088
05:01:05,560 --> 05:01:07,560
I hear tomboy.

4089
05:01:07,560 --> 05:01:09,560
I hear you.

4090
05:01:11,560 --> 05:01:13,560
Then I...

4091
05:01:13,560 --> 05:01:15,560
Uh-huh.

4092
05:01:15,560 --> 05:01:17,560
Mom says...

4093
05:01:17,560 --> 05:01:19,560
Good.

4094
05:01:19,560 --> 05:01:21,560
Oh, you go back here. Talk to mom again.

4095
05:01:21,560 --> 05:01:23,560
Hello, dear. By the way, it is...

4096
05:01:25,560 --> 05:01:27,560
This happened.

4097
05:01:27,560 --> 05:01:29,560
Don't forget to put...

4098
05:01:47,560 --> 05:01:49,560
Hmm, okay.

4099
05:01:49,560 --> 05:01:51,560
Now I talk to him.

4100
05:01:51,560 --> 05:01:53,560
Hey, did you...

4101
05:01:53,560 --> 05:01:55,560
Yes, I did.

4102
05:01:55,560 --> 05:01:57,560
You know this...

4103
05:01:57,560 --> 05:01:59,560
Take the sneakers.

4104
05:01:59,560 --> 05:02:01,560
Swirl.

4105
05:02:01,560 --> 05:02:03,560
And also the paper.

4106
05:02:11,560 --> 05:02:13,560
How do I get the alarm out then?

4107
05:02:17,560 --> 05:02:19,560
Hmm...

4108
05:02:19,560 --> 05:02:21,560
What's my definition of a tomboy?

4109
05:02:35,560 --> 05:02:37,560
Masculine traits?

4110
05:02:49,560 --> 05:02:51,560
Huh.

4111
05:02:53,560 --> 05:02:55,560
Okay.

4112
05:02:55,560 --> 05:02:57,560
How do we save her?

4113
05:02:57,560 --> 05:02:59,560
How do I... Fuck.

4114
05:03:11,560 --> 05:03:15,560
The alarm is in the living room, but your brother's a jerk.

4115
05:03:15,560 --> 05:03:17,560
I can try to get rid of that.

4116
05:03:19,560 --> 05:03:21,560
Oh, my God.

4117
05:03:21,560 --> 05:03:23,560
I want to kill him.

4118
05:03:49,560 --> 05:03:51,560
Where did she go?

4119
05:03:51,560 --> 05:03:53,560
I can't stop and chat, Steve.

4120
05:03:53,560 --> 05:03:55,560
With Karen gone, if I stop, I think I'll lose my mind.

4121
05:03:55,560 --> 05:03:57,560
I've got to keep busy.

4122
05:03:57,560 --> 05:03:59,560
Busy.

4123
05:03:59,560 --> 05:04:01,560
Excuse me.

4124
05:04:01,560 --> 05:04:03,560
I just heard that Mr. Johnson's tucker was vandalized.

4125
05:04:03,560 --> 05:04:05,560
You know, though I don't like to think ill of people

4126
05:04:05,560 --> 05:04:07,560
or take pleasure in the misfortunes of others.

4127
05:04:07,560 --> 05:04:09,560
I'd like to think it's a comeuppance

4128
05:04:09,560 --> 05:04:11,560
for all the people that I've met.

4129
05:04:11,560 --> 05:04:13,560
I've got to keep busy.

4130
05:04:13,560 --> 05:04:15,560
Busy.

4131
05:04:15,560 --> 05:04:17,560
Excuse me.

4132
05:04:17,560 --> 05:04:19,560
I'd like to think it's a comeuppance

4133
05:04:19,560 --> 05:04:21,560
for all the times that nasty man has bothered me.

4134
05:04:25,560 --> 05:04:27,560
I can't do it yet.

4135
05:04:47,560 --> 05:04:49,560
Yeah, let's check with Stephanie.

4136
05:05:01,560 --> 05:05:03,560
Oh, shit, wrong place.

4137
05:05:07,560 --> 05:05:09,560
Potsdam.

4138
05:05:09,560 --> 05:05:11,560
Did you say hello to your...

4139
05:05:11,560 --> 05:05:13,560
No, I haven't seen him yet.

4140
05:05:15,560 --> 05:05:17,560
His daughter, Karen, is missing.

4141
05:05:17,560 --> 05:05:19,560
How could anyone do something so terrible to her?

4142
05:05:19,560 --> 05:05:21,560
You think someone took her?

4143
05:05:21,560 --> 05:05:23,560
I think.

4144
05:05:23,560 --> 05:05:25,560
Oh, no, see, it was a kidnapping.

4145
05:05:25,560 --> 05:05:27,560
Haven't you heard?

4146
05:05:27,560 --> 05:05:29,560
The sheriff got a ransom note.

4147
05:05:29,560 --> 05:05:31,560
It seems someone wants to dip into Edna's lauder.

4148
05:05:31,560 --> 05:05:33,560
Too bad.

4149
05:05:33,560 --> 05:05:35,560
Such a bad thing.

4150
05:05:35,560 --> 05:05:37,560
I'm sorry.

4151
05:05:37,560 --> 05:05:39,560
Too bad such a sweet little thing

4152
05:05:39,560 --> 05:05:41,560
has to suffer.

4153
05:05:43,560 --> 05:05:45,560
Where were you Tuesday night?

4154
05:05:47,560 --> 05:05:49,560
That was a terrible night.

4155
05:05:49,560 --> 05:05:51,560
Our upstairs toilet backed up.

4156
05:05:51,560 --> 05:05:53,560
Pete Swell came over and fixed it.

4157
05:05:55,560 --> 05:05:57,560
My back still soar

4158
05:05:57,560 --> 05:05:59,560
from helping me carry his stuff up the stairs.

4159
05:06:01,560 --> 05:06:03,560
Someone went and scraped up Johnson's car?

4160
05:06:03,560 --> 05:06:05,560
Can you imagine?

4161
05:06:07,560 --> 05:06:09,560
He'd step in a bear trap

4162
05:06:09,560 --> 05:06:11,560
and chew his own leg off

4163
05:06:11,560 --> 05:06:13,560
rather than suffer a scratch.

4164
05:06:13,560 --> 05:06:15,560
Tucker serves the rich bastard right.

4165
05:06:15,560 --> 05:06:17,560
Okay, we're going all over the place.

4166
05:06:25,560 --> 05:06:27,560
Was Johnson behind the alibi?

4167
05:06:27,560 --> 05:06:29,560
I'm gonna just ask her.

4168
05:06:31,560 --> 05:06:33,560
Steve.

4169
05:06:33,560 --> 05:06:35,560
I'm sorry.

4170
05:06:35,560 --> 05:06:37,560
Want to hear what's happening out in the real world?

4171
05:06:37,560 --> 05:06:39,560
No.

4172
05:06:39,560 --> 05:06:41,560
I'd rather forget about Harvest for a while.

4173
05:06:43,560 --> 05:06:45,560
Come here.

4174
05:06:47,560 --> 05:06:49,560
What?

4175
05:06:51,560 --> 05:06:53,560
Stephanie.

4176
05:06:53,560 --> 05:06:55,560
I feel so close to you, Steve.

4177
05:06:57,560 --> 05:06:59,560
Like we're the only two people in Harvest.

4178
05:06:59,560 --> 05:07:01,560
The only two real people.

4179
05:07:01,560 --> 05:07:03,560
Do you know what I mean?

4180
05:07:03,560 --> 05:07:05,560
Do you know what I mean?

4181
05:07:09,560 --> 05:07:11,560
Yes?

4182
05:07:11,560 --> 05:07:13,560
I need to feel something again.

4183
05:07:13,560 --> 05:07:15,560
The sense I have that I've known you.

4184
05:07:15,560 --> 05:07:17,560
It's my only link to my past.

4185
05:07:19,560 --> 05:07:21,560
Yeah?

4186
05:07:21,560 --> 05:07:23,560
Maybe it's different than memory.

4187
05:07:23,560 --> 05:07:25,560
Okay, at least they just hold hands.

4188
05:07:25,560 --> 05:07:27,560
Yeah!

4189
05:07:27,560 --> 05:07:29,560
I had a nervous moment.

4190
05:07:29,560 --> 05:07:31,560
Strong feelings.

4191
05:07:31,560 --> 05:07:33,560
I'm so emo.

4192
05:07:33,560 --> 05:07:35,560
You would be too if you were all late.

4193
05:07:51,560 --> 05:07:53,560
Should I?

4194
05:07:55,560 --> 05:07:57,560
Should I do it, Chad?

4195
05:08:01,560 --> 05:08:03,560
I mean, surprise!

4196
05:08:09,560 --> 05:08:11,560
Then take me.

4197
05:08:11,560 --> 05:08:13,560
Now.

4198
05:08:21,560 --> 05:08:23,560
What?

4199
05:08:23,560 --> 05:08:25,560
Do you have the garden?

4200
05:08:31,560 --> 05:08:33,560
No.

4201
05:08:53,560 --> 05:08:55,560
Are we gonna be okay?

4202
05:09:01,560 --> 05:09:03,560
No.

4203
05:09:07,560 --> 05:09:09,560
It's fine!

4204
05:09:09,560 --> 05:09:11,560
Is he still in there?

4205
05:09:17,560 --> 05:09:19,560
We're good.

4206
05:09:19,560 --> 05:09:21,560
We're safe, I think.

4207
05:09:23,560 --> 05:09:25,560
If it isn't my favorite son-in-law,

4208
05:09:25,560 --> 05:09:27,560
what brings you here again?

4209
05:09:31,560 --> 05:09:33,560
Huh?

4210
05:09:35,560 --> 05:09:37,560
Thank you for the $3.33.

4211
05:09:37,560 --> 05:09:39,560
Hey, Merce.

4212
05:09:39,560 --> 05:09:41,560
For a tiny-

4213
05:09:41,560 --> 05:09:43,560
Spiny?

4214
05:09:43,560 --> 05:09:45,560
Spiny?

4215
05:09:45,560 --> 05:09:47,560
Hi, Merce.

4216
05:09:47,560 --> 05:09:49,560
I apologize, but your son-in-law must go to sleep.

4217
05:09:49,560 --> 05:09:51,560
I'll try and watch the rest of the vlog tomorrow.

4218
05:09:51,560 --> 05:09:53,560
Good luck with the rest of the game, Kohai.

4219
05:09:53,560 --> 05:09:55,560
Okay, have good sleep.

4220
05:09:55,560 --> 05:09:57,560
Thank you for tuning in.

4221
05:09:57,560 --> 05:09:59,560
You!

4222
05:09:59,560 --> 05:10:01,560
Yeah, whole!

4223
05:10:11,560 --> 05:10:13,560
We spying!

4224
05:10:17,560 --> 05:10:19,560
What about Karen again?

4225
05:10:25,560 --> 05:10:27,560
Maybe I can talk to the mother?

4226
05:10:29,560 --> 05:10:31,560
Hello, dear.

4227
05:10:31,560 --> 05:10:33,560
Yes, please.

4228
05:10:33,560 --> 05:10:35,560
She's upstairs.

4229
05:10:35,560 --> 05:10:37,560
Have you heard that Edna's daughter, Karen,

4230
05:10:37,560 --> 05:10:39,560
has disappeared?

4231
05:10:39,560 --> 05:10:41,560
These things happen.

4232
05:10:41,560 --> 05:10:43,560
We just have to deal with them step-by-step

4233
05:10:43,560 --> 05:10:45,560
one day at a time.

4234
05:10:51,560 --> 05:10:53,560
Man!

4235
05:10:53,560 --> 05:10:55,560
Who told you about Karen?

4236
05:10:59,560 --> 05:11:01,560
Why, I suppose it was Mr. Poston.

4237
05:11:01,560 --> 05:11:03,560
Or maybe not.

4238
05:11:03,560 --> 05:11:05,560
I can't remember.

4239
05:11:05,560 --> 05:11:07,560
Please excuse me, Steve.

4240
05:11:07,560 --> 05:11:09,560
You seem flustered.

4241
05:11:09,560 --> 05:11:11,560
Not at all.

4242
05:11:11,560 --> 05:11:13,560
Everything is fine.

4243
05:11:13,560 --> 05:11:15,560
Hmm.

4244
05:11:15,560 --> 05:11:17,560
Can I talk about Karen again?

4245
05:11:17,560 --> 05:11:19,560
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

4246
05:11:19,560 --> 05:11:21,560
Nighty-sus.

4247
05:11:29,560 --> 05:11:33,560
Where were you Tuesday night?

4248
05:11:37,560 --> 05:11:39,560
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

4249
05:11:39,560 --> 05:11:41,560
Tuesday?

4250
05:11:41,560 --> 05:11:43,560
Sorry, I didn't...

4251
05:11:43,560 --> 05:11:45,560
I don't think nothing happens with her

4252
05:11:45,560 --> 05:11:47,560
if you just say fuck.

4253
05:11:47,560 --> 05:11:49,560
Sorry, I...

4254
05:11:49,560 --> 05:11:51,560
Give my regards to your parents.

4255
05:11:53,560 --> 05:11:55,560
Tuesday?

4256
05:12:01,560 --> 05:12:03,560
Interesting.

4257
05:12:11,560 --> 05:12:13,560
I might...

4258
05:12:15,560 --> 05:12:17,560
Oh, wait.

4259
05:12:17,560 --> 05:12:19,560
Was that a different animation?

4260
05:12:19,560 --> 05:12:21,560
Sorry.

4261
05:12:25,560 --> 05:12:27,560
Okay, okay.

4262
05:12:29,560 --> 05:12:33,560
I guess I'll just have to ask alibis, right?

4263
05:12:35,560 --> 05:12:37,560
Do I ask everyone?

4264
05:12:37,560 --> 05:12:39,560
Stop peeping!

4265
05:12:39,560 --> 05:12:41,560
It's a new animation!

4266
05:12:49,560 --> 05:12:51,560
Okay, so I messed up and

4267
05:12:51,560 --> 05:12:53,560
I didn't get mom's alibi.

4268
05:12:53,560 --> 05:12:55,560
So...

4269
05:12:55,560 --> 05:12:57,560
Let's go.

4270
05:13:01,560 --> 05:13:03,560
Hello, Steve. Care to buy?

4271
05:13:03,560 --> 05:13:05,560
Oh, thanks.

4272
05:13:05,560 --> 05:13:07,560
Okay, dear.

4273
05:13:07,560 --> 05:13:09,560
Come back soon.

4274
05:13:09,560 --> 05:13:11,560
Steve, you live close to Mr. Johnson.

4275
05:13:11,560 --> 05:13:13,560
How is he taking it?

4276
05:13:13,560 --> 05:13:15,560
Such wanton vandalism.

4277
05:13:15,560 --> 05:13:17,560
It just breaks my heart.

4278
05:13:17,560 --> 05:13:19,560
I'll have to send him a nice fruit basket.

4279
05:13:19,560 --> 05:13:21,560
Though if he wants some new paint and sealant,

4280
05:13:21,560 --> 05:13:23,560
it'll cost him.

4281
05:13:25,560 --> 05:13:27,560
Heavens, did you hear that Karen has disappeared?

4282
05:13:27,560 --> 05:13:29,560
I saw her playing outside the wayward hotel

4283
05:13:29,560 --> 05:13:31,560
on Tuesday night.

4284
05:13:31,560 --> 05:13:33,560
The night she vanished.

4285
05:13:33,560 --> 05:13:35,560
Did she seem upset?

4286
05:13:35,560 --> 05:13:37,560
Wayward hotel, huh?

4287
05:13:37,560 --> 05:13:39,560
Betsy, no.

4288
05:13:39,560 --> 05:13:41,560
She was under adult supervision.

4289
05:13:41,560 --> 05:13:43,560
So I didn't think anything of it.

4290
05:13:43,560 --> 05:13:45,560
You mean Edna was with her?

4291
05:13:45,560 --> 05:13:47,560
No, not Edna.

4292
05:13:47,560 --> 05:13:49,560
A man.

4293
05:13:49,560 --> 05:13:51,560
Or an inordinately large woman.

4294
05:13:51,560 --> 05:13:53,560
Large man or woman, huh?

4295
05:13:53,560 --> 05:13:55,560
Alright.

4296
05:14:01,560 --> 05:14:03,560
Large man or woman?

4297
05:14:05,560 --> 05:14:07,560
Sorry, son.

4298
05:14:07,560 --> 05:14:09,560
No time to talk.

4299
05:14:09,560 --> 05:14:11,560
Neither.

4300
05:14:11,560 --> 05:14:13,560
Next time you post.

4301
05:14:15,560 --> 05:14:17,560
Large...

4302
05:14:17,560 --> 05:14:19,560
men...

4303
05:14:19,560 --> 05:14:21,560
or women?

4304
05:14:27,560 --> 05:14:29,560
Hold on.

4305
05:14:29,560 --> 05:14:31,560
Is it...?

4306
05:14:31,560 --> 05:14:33,560
There's...

4307
05:14:33,560 --> 05:14:35,560
two large men...

4308
05:14:35,560 --> 05:14:37,560
I think.

4309
05:14:37,560 --> 05:14:39,560
That would be...

4310
05:14:39,560 --> 05:14:41,560
Johnson...

4311
05:14:41,560 --> 05:14:43,560
the sheriff...

4312
05:14:45,560 --> 05:14:47,560
and...

4313
05:14:49,560 --> 05:14:51,560
Mr. Potsdam.

4314
05:14:55,560 --> 05:14:57,560
Think about taking some of that sighting off my hand, son.

4315
05:14:57,560 --> 05:14:59,560
Okay.

4316
05:14:59,560 --> 05:15:01,560
I'll cut you a nice price on it.

4317
05:15:03,560 --> 05:15:05,560
Too bad about Edna's daughter going missing.

4318
05:15:07,560 --> 05:15:09,560
That was a strange night.

4319
05:15:11,560 --> 05:15:13,560
I remember that evening.

4320
05:15:13,560 --> 05:15:15,560
The Potsdam's upstairs bathroom toilet packed up.

4321
05:15:17,560 --> 05:15:19,560
I've seen folks upset about that stuff.

4322
05:15:21,560 --> 05:15:23,560
But Mr. Potsdam was just...

4323
05:15:23,560 --> 05:15:25,560
furious.

4324
05:15:25,560 --> 05:15:27,560
Hey, they even got it downstairs.

4325
05:15:29,560 --> 05:15:31,560
They got it downstairs, brother.

4326
05:15:45,560 --> 05:15:47,560
I thought he was working with you!

4327
05:15:59,560 --> 05:16:01,560
Well, that's a sure sign...

4328
05:16:01,560 --> 05:16:03,560
that civilization is coming to an end.

4329
05:16:11,560 --> 05:16:13,560
I don't think it was aliens.

4330
05:16:25,560 --> 05:16:27,560
Uh...

4331
05:16:27,560 --> 05:16:29,560
I don't want to hear about Tuesday.

4332
05:16:41,560 --> 05:16:43,560
Lights in a cemetery.

4333
05:16:49,560 --> 05:16:51,560
Give me a second.

4334
05:16:53,560 --> 05:16:55,560
I want to see the note they got at the police station.

4335
05:16:57,560 --> 05:16:59,560
Boy,

4336
05:16:59,560 --> 05:17:01,560
the way you keep pestering me,

4337
05:17:01,560 --> 05:17:03,560
you'd think you were feeling guilty about something.

4338
05:17:03,560 --> 05:17:05,560
Are you?

4339
05:17:05,560 --> 05:17:07,560
I understand you witnessed Ms. Whaley's

4340
05:17:07,560 --> 05:17:09,560
dispensing a little discipline at the school.

4341
05:17:09,560 --> 05:17:11,560
And she thinks you may be

4342
05:17:11,560 --> 05:17:13,560
feeling a mite bent about it.

4343
05:17:17,560 --> 05:17:19,560
Am I in my own business, Sheriff?

4344
05:17:19,560 --> 05:17:21,560
That's always the wisest course, boy.

4345
05:17:23,560 --> 05:17:25,560
Sticking your nose where it doesn't belong

4346
05:17:25,560 --> 05:17:27,560
can get you in a world of trouble.

4347
05:17:27,560 --> 05:17:29,560
Especially if you're a gynecologist.

4348
05:17:31,560 --> 05:17:33,560
Heck, there isn't a psychiatrist

4349
05:17:33,560 --> 05:17:35,560
around who disagree about

4350
05:17:35,560 --> 05:17:37,560
what a calm and influential

4351
05:17:37,560 --> 05:17:39,560
dent in the head.

4352
05:17:39,560 --> 05:17:41,560
Calm and influential?

4353
05:17:41,560 --> 05:17:43,560
If you argue with science, Steve,

4354
05:17:43,560 --> 05:17:45,560
it's bigger than all of us.

4355
05:17:45,560 --> 05:17:47,560
I got a report here that someone

4356
05:17:47,560 --> 05:17:49,560
put a ding on Johnson's tucker.

4357
05:17:51,560 --> 05:17:53,560
As honoured as Johnson is about

4358
05:17:53,560 --> 05:17:55,560
that old car, I suppose

4359
05:17:55,560 --> 05:17:57,560
he had it coming.

4360
05:17:57,560 --> 05:17:59,560
I imagine it was just some kids pulling a prank.

4361
05:17:59,560 --> 05:18:01,560
I suppose you've

4362
05:18:01,560 --> 05:18:03,560
heard the news about Edna's daughter, Karen,

4363
05:18:03,560 --> 05:18:05,560
disappearing.

4364
05:18:07,560 --> 05:18:09,560
What should I say?

4365
05:18:09,560 --> 05:18:11,560
Yes, I'm very concerned.

4366
05:18:11,560 --> 05:18:13,560
Or no,

4367
05:18:13,560 --> 05:18:15,560
Karen vanished?

4368
05:18:15,560 --> 05:18:17,560
What should I say?

4369
05:18:17,560 --> 05:18:19,560
One?

4370
05:18:23,560 --> 05:18:25,560
Okay.

4371
05:18:29,560 --> 05:18:31,560
I wouldn't think about it too much

4372
05:18:31,560 --> 05:18:33,560
if I were you.

4373
05:18:33,560 --> 05:18:35,560
This is a serious crime.

4374
05:18:35,560 --> 05:18:37,560
And this is no time for civilians

4375
05:18:37,560 --> 05:18:39,560
to be nosing around playing cops and robbers.

4376
05:18:41,560 --> 05:18:43,560
What about civic responsibility?

4377
05:18:43,560 --> 05:18:45,560
Steve,

4378
05:18:45,560 --> 05:18:47,560
I'd give this advice to my own son

4379
05:18:47,560 --> 05:18:49,560
if I had one.

4380
05:18:49,560 --> 05:18:51,560
Leave this be.

4381
05:18:51,560 --> 05:18:53,560
This is not the kind of thing you should look into.

4382
05:18:53,560 --> 05:18:55,560
I'm being paid off.

4383
05:18:55,560 --> 05:18:57,560
So some wild oats, boy.

4384
05:18:57,560 --> 05:18:59,560
Kick up your heels.

4385
05:18:59,560 --> 05:19:01,560
Join the lodge.

4386
05:19:01,560 --> 05:19:03,560
Join the lodge, Steve.

4387
05:19:03,560 --> 05:19:05,560
And leave Karen to the professionals.

4388
05:19:07,560 --> 05:19:09,560
Stop on by any time.

4389
05:19:09,560 --> 05:19:11,560
No, no, no.

4390
05:19:11,560 --> 05:19:13,560
Hold on.

4391
05:19:15,560 --> 05:19:17,560
I'm sorry.

4392
05:19:17,560 --> 05:19:19,560
I don't feel a...

4393
05:19:19,560 --> 05:19:21,560
any time.

4394
05:19:25,560 --> 05:19:27,560
Where's the note?

4395
05:19:27,560 --> 05:19:29,560
Where's the note?

4396
05:19:29,560 --> 05:19:31,560
Where's the note?

4397
05:19:37,560 --> 05:19:39,560
You said there was a note. Where's the fucking note?

4398
05:19:45,560 --> 05:19:47,560
Where's the note?

4399
05:20:01,560 --> 05:20:03,560
I can't stop and chat.

4400
05:20:15,560 --> 05:20:17,560
That's it.

4401
05:20:17,560 --> 05:20:19,560
It's Stephanie's forge.

4402
05:20:31,560 --> 05:20:33,560
Hold on.

4403
05:20:33,560 --> 05:20:35,560
Flashing lights in the cemetery, right?

4404
05:20:35,560 --> 05:20:37,560
Well, that didn't work.

4405
05:20:37,560 --> 05:20:39,560
Well, that didn't work.

4406
05:20:45,560 --> 05:20:47,560
Can I move this?

4407
05:20:51,560 --> 05:20:53,560
I moved it!

4408
05:20:59,560 --> 05:21:01,560
Oh, my God!

4409
05:21:01,560 --> 05:21:03,560
Thank God I found you.

4410
05:21:03,560 --> 05:21:05,560
Are you all right, Karen?

4411
05:21:05,560 --> 05:21:07,560
I want to go home.

4412
05:21:07,560 --> 05:21:09,560
I'll be right back.

4413
05:21:09,560 --> 05:21:11,560
I'll be right back.

4414
05:21:11,560 --> 05:21:13,560
I found you.

4415
05:21:13,560 --> 05:21:15,560
Are you all right, Karen?

4416
05:21:15,560 --> 05:21:17,560
I want to go home.

4417
05:21:17,560 --> 05:21:19,560
Could you take me to my mommy's store?

4418
05:21:19,560 --> 05:21:21,560
Or to the policeman?

4419
05:21:21,560 --> 05:21:23,560
Can you tell me who did this to you?

4420
05:21:23,560 --> 05:21:25,560
Mr. Potstan

4421
05:21:25,560 --> 05:21:27,560
told me he'd hurt my mommy

4422
05:21:27,560 --> 05:21:29,560
if I told.

4423
05:21:29,560 --> 05:21:31,560
Won't do anything, I promise.

4424
05:21:31,560 --> 05:21:33,560
Tell me what happened.

4425
05:21:33,560 --> 05:21:35,560
He made me play house.

4426
05:21:35,560 --> 05:21:37,560
Then he dug a hole.

4427
05:21:37,560 --> 05:21:39,560
Please.

4428
05:21:39,560 --> 05:21:41,560
Can you go home now?

4429
05:21:41,560 --> 05:21:43,560
Please.

4430
05:21:43,560 --> 05:21:45,560
Can you tell me your address, honey?

4431
05:21:45,560 --> 05:21:47,560
I don't know.

4432
05:21:47,560 --> 05:21:49,560
Just take me to the store

4433
05:21:49,560 --> 05:21:51,560
or the policeman.

4434
05:21:51,560 --> 05:21:53,560
Please.

4435
05:21:53,560 --> 05:21:55,560
Mommy said to go to the policeman

4436
05:21:55,560 --> 05:21:57,560
if I got lost.

4437
05:21:57,560 --> 05:21:59,560
And I'm lost.

4438
05:22:01,560 --> 05:22:03,560
Bye bye.

4439
05:22:03,560 --> 05:22:05,560
What do you mean bye bye? We need to take you home!

4440
05:22:09,560 --> 05:22:11,560
How do I...

4441
05:22:11,560 --> 05:22:13,560
What do you mean bye bye?

4442
05:22:13,560 --> 05:22:15,560
We need to take you home!

4443
05:22:15,560 --> 05:22:17,560
How do I take her home?

4444
05:22:17,560 --> 05:22:19,560
What do you mean bye bye?

4445
05:22:35,560 --> 05:22:37,560
I don't trust the police.

4446
05:22:37,560 --> 05:22:39,560
I'm going back to the store.

4447
05:22:39,560 --> 05:22:41,560
What the hell?

4448
05:22:41,560 --> 05:22:43,560
Bring it! Thank you.

4449
05:23:07,560 --> 05:23:09,560
Bye bye.

4450
05:23:17,560 --> 05:23:19,560
I can't talk now.

4451
05:23:19,560 --> 05:23:21,560
The dishes are stacked up.

4452
05:23:23,560 --> 05:23:25,560
Okay!

4453
05:23:27,560 --> 05:23:29,560
I have money now!

4454
05:23:33,560 --> 05:23:35,560
I have money, right?

4455
05:23:35,560 --> 05:23:37,560
To the store?

4456
05:23:39,560 --> 05:23:41,560
And buy things?

4457
05:23:41,560 --> 05:23:43,560
Oh shit. I should save the game!

4458
05:23:43,560 --> 05:23:45,560
I should save!

4459
05:23:59,560 --> 05:24:01,560
Wait.

4460
05:24:01,560 --> 05:24:03,560
Where's the money?

4461
05:24:03,560 --> 05:24:05,560
I borrowed money.

4462
05:24:13,560 --> 05:24:15,560
I want that.

4463
05:24:15,560 --> 05:24:17,560
And I want this.

4464
05:24:19,560 --> 05:24:21,560
Oops.

4465
05:24:21,560 --> 05:24:23,560
Did I make a mistake?

4466
05:24:33,560 --> 05:24:35,560
That should cover it.

4467
05:24:35,560 --> 05:24:37,560
These 1950s prices are cheap.

4468
05:24:37,560 --> 05:24:39,560
Take what you need.

4469
05:24:47,560 --> 05:24:49,560
I don't need anything, right?

4470
05:24:49,560 --> 05:24:51,560
Wait. I need that.

4471
05:24:53,560 --> 05:24:55,560
I think that's all I need?

4472
05:24:55,560 --> 05:24:57,560
Yeah.

4473
05:24:59,560 --> 05:25:01,560
Are we going to be able to complete this game tonight?

4474
05:25:03,560 --> 05:25:05,560
I don't know!

4475
05:25:07,560 --> 05:25:09,560
No thanks.

4476
05:25:25,560 --> 05:25:27,560
Can I go down?

4477
05:25:27,560 --> 05:25:29,560
Thanks.

4478
05:25:33,560 --> 05:25:35,560
Where's the closet again?

4479
05:25:35,560 --> 05:25:37,560
This one?

4480
05:25:39,560 --> 05:25:41,560
Maybe I should save.

4481
05:25:43,560 --> 05:25:45,560
Save game.

4482
05:25:57,560 --> 05:25:59,560
Well that didn't work.

4483
05:25:59,560 --> 05:26:01,560
Oh man.

4484
05:26:01,560 --> 05:26:03,560
Oh man.

4485
05:26:03,560 --> 05:26:05,560
Well that didn't work.

4486
05:26:05,560 --> 05:26:07,560
Oh man.

4487
05:26:07,560 --> 05:26:09,560
Oh man.

4488
05:26:09,560 --> 05:26:11,560
Well that didn't work.

4489
05:26:11,560 --> 05:26:13,560
Wait. Which one is it?

4490
05:26:21,560 --> 05:26:23,560
Wait. Which one is it?

4491
05:26:23,560 --> 05:26:25,560
Guys! Which one is it?

4492
05:26:31,560 --> 05:26:35,560
I couldn't get up in the morning.

4493
05:26:39,560 --> 05:26:43,560
It feels kind of dark so I can't tell what time it is.

4494
05:26:43,560 --> 05:26:45,560
What time it is?

4495
05:26:59,560 --> 05:27:01,560
What's up?

4496
05:27:01,560 --> 05:27:03,560
Get a tap?

4497
05:27:13,560 --> 05:27:15,560
Okay.

4498
05:27:23,560 --> 05:27:25,560
Can I go into the inn?

4499
05:27:25,560 --> 05:27:27,560
I don't think I've been to the inn yet.

4500
05:27:27,560 --> 05:27:29,560
Why are you talking like that?

4501
05:27:41,560 --> 05:27:43,560
Why are you talking like that?

4502
05:27:57,560 --> 05:27:59,560
Oh we have to steal the mall, right?

4503
05:28:01,560 --> 05:28:03,560
But why does he...

4504
05:28:03,560 --> 05:28:05,560
Why is he like...

4505
05:28:09,560 --> 05:28:11,560
ETA big sale.

4506
05:28:11,560 --> 05:28:13,560
Door is locked.

4507
05:28:13,560 --> 05:28:15,560
Ugh.

4508
05:28:25,560 --> 05:28:27,560
I have several places I can set fire to.

4509
05:28:27,560 --> 05:28:29,560
Should I set fire?

4510
05:28:29,560 --> 05:28:31,560
Not set fire.

4511
05:28:31,560 --> 05:28:33,560
Should I do the...

4512
05:28:33,560 --> 05:28:35,560
Barbershop?

4513
05:28:37,560 --> 05:28:39,560
Let's save at the barbershop.

4514
05:28:43,560 --> 05:28:45,560
Okay.

4515
05:28:55,560 --> 05:28:57,560
Straight lace...

4516
05:28:57,560 --> 05:28:59,560
Slot screws...

4517
05:28:59,560 --> 05:29:01,560
Does the fill-up work with it?

4518
05:29:03,560 --> 05:29:05,560
Well that didn't work.

4519
05:29:05,560 --> 05:29:07,560
Well that didn't work.

4520
05:29:13,560 --> 05:29:15,560
Yeah, it has a sprinkler system.

4521
05:29:15,560 --> 05:29:17,560
Which is why I was wondering...

4522
05:29:17,560 --> 05:29:19,560
I could use it.

4523
05:29:21,560 --> 05:29:23,560
Well that didn't work.

4524
05:29:23,560 --> 05:29:25,560
What about...

4525
05:29:25,560 --> 05:29:27,560
The school's fire alarm?

4526
05:29:45,560 --> 05:29:47,560
What about the school's fire alarm?

4527
05:29:47,560 --> 05:29:49,560
What about the school's fire alarm?

4528
05:29:49,560 --> 05:29:51,560
What about the school's fire alarm?

4529
05:30:01,560 --> 05:30:03,560
I gotta get out of here.

4530
05:30:15,560 --> 05:30:17,560
I can get an axe.

4531
05:30:20,560 --> 05:30:22,560
I can get a ladder too.

4532
05:30:29,560 --> 05:30:31,560
Wait, how do I get in?

4533
05:30:37,560 --> 05:30:39,560
Wait someone, how do I get in?

4534
05:30:41,560 --> 05:30:43,560
You just go in.

4535
05:30:43,560 --> 05:30:45,560
It's not letting me, just go in.

4536
05:30:49,560 --> 05:30:51,560
Wait what?

4537
05:30:55,560 --> 05:30:57,560
There a hole in the second story window?

4538
05:31:05,560 --> 05:31:07,560
Are you sure I can just go in?

4539
05:31:07,560 --> 05:31:09,560
Damn it.

4540
05:31:13,560 --> 05:31:15,560
Are you sure I can just go in?

4541
05:31:21,560 --> 05:31:23,560
Okay.

4542
05:31:31,560 --> 05:31:33,560
What?

4543
05:31:33,560 --> 05:31:35,560
Try a ladder?

4544
05:31:35,560 --> 05:31:37,560
A ladder on what?

4545
05:31:57,560 --> 05:31:59,560
How do I get in?

4546
05:32:03,560 --> 05:32:05,560
Okay.

4547
05:32:15,560 --> 05:32:17,560
I don't get it.

4548
05:32:19,560 --> 05:32:21,560
Oh man.

4549
05:32:21,560 --> 05:32:23,560
Help!

4550
05:32:23,560 --> 05:32:25,560
Help, help!

4551
05:32:25,560 --> 05:32:27,560
Help!

4552
05:32:33,560 --> 05:32:35,560
Help!

4553
05:32:45,560 --> 05:32:49,560
Am I supposed to go to the school then?

4554
05:33:03,560 --> 05:33:05,560
Help!

4555
05:33:23,560 --> 05:33:27,560
Okay, but I want to go into the place.

4556
05:33:27,560 --> 05:33:33,560
I have to get out in at night?

4557
05:33:35,560 --> 05:33:37,560
Aw.

4558
05:33:57,560 --> 05:33:59,560
Give me back my key.

4559
05:34:05,560 --> 05:34:07,560
Okay.

4560
05:34:07,560 --> 05:34:09,560
No?

4561
05:34:11,560 --> 05:34:13,560
Which is the closet?

4562
05:34:13,560 --> 05:34:15,560
Which is the closet?

4563
05:34:29,560 --> 05:34:31,560
All the alarm at my house?

4564
05:34:31,560 --> 05:34:33,560
Okay.

4565
05:34:43,560 --> 05:34:45,560
What do I just push it?

4566
05:34:47,560 --> 05:34:49,560
Of the axe?

4567
05:34:53,560 --> 05:34:55,560
Do I use the ladder then?

4568
05:34:57,560 --> 05:34:59,560
Damn it.

4569
05:35:01,560 --> 05:35:03,560
Uh, wrench?

4570
05:35:09,560 --> 05:35:11,560
Use axe on brother, I would do that.

4571
05:35:14,560 --> 05:35:16,560
He didn't care.

4572
05:35:36,560 --> 05:35:40,560
Do I use the ladder here?

4573
05:35:43,560 --> 05:35:45,560
Okay.

4574
05:35:45,560 --> 05:35:47,560
Oh man.

4575
05:35:53,560 --> 05:35:55,560
Okay.

4576
05:36:13,560 --> 05:36:15,560
Hmm.

4577
05:36:23,560 --> 05:36:27,560
I should change to a magnifying glass, huh?

4578
05:36:27,560 --> 05:36:29,560
Is it changing?

4579
05:36:31,560 --> 05:36:33,560
I think you need a furniture dolly.

4580
05:36:33,560 --> 05:36:35,560
A dolly?

4581
05:36:39,560 --> 05:36:41,560
What am I going to get a dolly?

4582
05:36:43,560 --> 05:36:45,560
Okay.

4583
05:36:55,560 --> 05:36:57,560
How are you not tired?

4584
05:36:57,560 --> 05:37:03,560
I'm a bit tired, but I want to finish this day first, Senpai.

4585
05:37:03,560 --> 05:37:09,560
I want to finish this day first, and then maybe we can, you know...

4586
05:37:13,560 --> 05:37:15,560
Okay.

4587
05:37:19,560 --> 05:37:23,560
Then we move on to the next day.

4588
05:37:23,560 --> 05:37:25,560
Oh man.

4589
05:37:25,560 --> 05:37:27,560
Okay.

4590
05:37:27,560 --> 05:37:29,560
Okay.

4591
05:37:35,560 --> 05:37:39,560
I'm not, I don't have the same stamina as Shibi or...

4592
05:37:39,560 --> 05:37:41,560
...our mummy.

4593
05:37:41,560 --> 05:37:44,560
But I do, I am kind of like oof.

4594
05:37:44,560 --> 05:37:46,560
Tired.

4595
05:37:51,560 --> 05:37:53,560
Is there a dolly here?

4596
05:38:09,560 --> 05:38:11,560
Mr. Johnson's garage?

4597
05:38:30,560 --> 05:38:32,560
Oops.

4598
05:38:32,560 --> 05:38:34,560
Fatboy, well I'll make the carrot.

4599
05:38:34,560 --> 05:38:36,560
I'll make the carrot.

4600
05:38:36,560 --> 05:38:38,560
Fatboy, huh?

4601
05:38:46,560 --> 05:38:48,560
What do you mean?

4602
05:38:50,560 --> 05:38:52,560
What do you mean?

4603
05:38:56,560 --> 05:38:58,560
What do you mean?

4604
05:38:58,560 --> 05:39:00,560
I messed it up for you.

4605
05:39:00,560 --> 05:39:02,560
What?

4606
05:39:03,560 --> 05:39:05,560
Can I go in here?

4607
05:39:20,560 --> 05:39:22,560
Oh.

4608
05:39:22,560 --> 05:39:24,560
Okay.

4609
05:39:26,560 --> 05:39:28,560
Anything else I need?

4610
05:39:31,560 --> 05:39:35,560
I can just go in and out, huh? That's kind of weird.

4611
05:39:49,560 --> 05:39:51,560
What? Why?

4612
05:39:51,560 --> 05:39:53,560
Okay, bye.

4613
05:39:53,560 --> 05:39:57,560
Suddenly the dialogue came back?

4614
05:40:00,560 --> 05:40:02,560
Okay.

4615
05:40:11,560 --> 05:40:13,560
What's this?

4616
05:40:15,560 --> 05:40:17,560
Turn off the alarm system.

4617
05:40:19,560 --> 05:40:21,560
Okay, let's save here.

4618
05:40:31,560 --> 05:40:36,560
What? Undo the screws?

4619
05:40:42,560 --> 05:40:46,560
This photograph is a constant torture for borrowed dad.

4620
05:40:46,560 --> 05:40:48,560
Exotic kinky love equipment.

4621
05:40:48,560 --> 05:40:50,560
No, leave that there.

4622
05:40:50,560 --> 05:40:52,560
If any of it turns up missing.

4623
05:40:54,560 --> 05:40:57,560
Marv, what's going on in there?

4624
05:41:01,560 --> 05:41:03,560
Go! Go!

4625
05:41:03,560 --> 05:41:07,560
Wait, no dad, I need you. I need you to sign this first.

4626
05:41:07,560 --> 05:41:12,560
I need some meat, and Pat won't give me any without your sign permission.

4627
05:41:12,560 --> 05:41:14,560
Good old dependable Pat.

4628
05:41:14,560 --> 05:41:18,560
Here son, here's my signature.

4629
05:41:18,560 --> 05:41:21,560
Take it to him, and you won't have any problem.

4630
05:41:21,560 --> 05:41:25,560
Now go son, go quickly, before she comes back.

4631
05:41:26,560 --> 05:41:29,560
Not yet, dad, I want to talk to you.

4632
05:41:34,560 --> 05:41:38,560
Are you my father? Really? I don't remember you.

4633
05:41:38,560 --> 05:41:42,560
Please. I'm not in the mood for jokes.

4634
05:41:42,560 --> 05:41:44,560
I'm serious, why won't anyone believe me?

4635
05:41:44,560 --> 05:41:47,560
Oh my gosh, that's all you care about?

4636
05:41:47,560 --> 05:41:51,560
Just don't make me laugh now.

4637
05:41:51,560 --> 05:41:56,560
Remember the stitches? My God, what has she done to you?

4638
05:41:56,560 --> 05:42:00,560
She doesn't know you're here, does she? Does she?

4639
05:42:03,560 --> 05:42:07,560
No, I had to break in. What the hell is going on in here?

4640
05:42:07,560 --> 05:42:09,560
I know it's a mystery to you.

4641
05:42:09,560 --> 05:42:14,560
The sacred things that husband wants you behind closed doors.

4642
05:42:14,560 --> 05:42:18,560
Maybe we should have the special father's son dog.

4643
05:42:19,560 --> 05:42:22,560
The special father's son dog?

4644
05:42:23,560 --> 05:42:25,560
Yeah, I'd like that.

4645
05:42:41,560 --> 05:42:43,560
Okay. Yeah?

4646
05:42:49,560 --> 05:42:52,560
And bolt it with at least three locks.

4647
05:42:52,560 --> 05:42:54,560
At least three?

4648
05:43:14,560 --> 05:43:16,560
Aww.

4649
05:43:18,560 --> 05:43:22,560
They close on the woman, and then they...

4650
05:43:25,560 --> 05:43:28,560
With the barbed wire, they...

4651
05:43:30,560 --> 05:43:34,560
That's all right, don't get worked up. You need your rest.

4652
05:43:34,560 --> 05:43:37,560
Yes, rest.

4653
05:43:37,560 --> 05:43:39,560
But why did you come?

4654
05:43:39,560 --> 05:43:43,560
You must have had a reason for risking it.

4655
05:43:43,560 --> 05:43:47,560
I need some meat, and Pat won't give me any without your signed permission.

4656
05:43:47,560 --> 05:43:49,560
Good old dependable, Pat.

4657
05:43:49,560 --> 05:43:53,560
Here, son. Here's my signature.

4658
05:43:53,560 --> 05:43:56,560
Take it to him, and you won't have any problem.

4659
05:43:56,560 --> 05:44:00,560
Now go, son. Go quickly, before she comes back.

4660
05:44:05,560 --> 05:44:09,560
This is no time to talk, gibberish. Get out of here.

4661
05:44:09,560 --> 05:44:11,560
Now!

4662
05:44:11,560 --> 05:44:14,560
I love you, Dad.

4663
05:44:14,560 --> 05:44:16,560
This is no time to talk.

4664
05:44:16,560 --> 05:44:17,560
Love?

4665
05:44:17,560 --> 05:44:18,560
This is no time to talk.

4666
05:44:18,560 --> 05:44:20,560
Okay. Bye, Dad.

4667
05:44:25,560 --> 05:44:27,560
So do I put it back?

4668
05:44:27,560 --> 05:44:29,560
Well, that didn't work.

4669
05:44:29,560 --> 05:44:31,560
Aw, man.

4670
05:44:31,560 --> 05:44:33,560
Well, that didn't work.

4671
05:44:35,560 --> 05:44:37,560
Huh.

4672
05:44:39,560 --> 05:44:41,560
Okay, well...

4673
05:44:41,560 --> 05:44:43,560
At least...

4674
05:44:43,560 --> 05:44:45,560
I don't know what to do.

4675
05:44:45,560 --> 05:44:47,560
I don't know what to do.

4676
05:44:47,560 --> 05:44:49,560
I don't know what to do.

4677
05:44:49,560 --> 05:44:51,560
I don't know what to do.

4678
05:44:51,560 --> 05:44:53,560
I don't know what to do.

4679
05:44:53,560 --> 05:44:55,560
Okay, well...

4680
05:44:55,560 --> 05:44:57,560
At least...

4681
05:44:57,560 --> 05:45:00,560
Dad taught me the last words.

4682
05:45:00,560 --> 05:45:03,560
With his last words about what...

4683
05:45:03,560 --> 05:45:05,560
What the...

4684
05:45:05,560 --> 05:45:07,560
You know, married couples do.

4685
05:45:24,560 --> 05:45:27,560
Yeah, Dad taught us a lot.

4686
05:45:27,560 --> 05:45:29,560
Well, that didn't work.

4687
05:45:29,560 --> 05:45:31,560
Well, that didn't work.

4688
05:45:31,560 --> 05:45:33,560
Well, that didn't work.

4689
05:45:33,560 --> 05:45:35,560
Well, that didn't work.

4690
05:45:35,560 --> 05:45:37,560
That won't happen to us, right, Kohai?

4691
05:45:37,560 --> 05:45:39,560
Just be good.

4692
05:45:43,560 --> 05:45:45,560
I guess I'll go to the meat plant.

4693
05:45:45,560 --> 05:45:47,560
And I'll give myself some meat.

4694
05:45:47,560 --> 05:45:49,560
Well, that didn't work.

4695
05:45:49,560 --> 05:45:51,560
So, your father okayed the meat, huh?

4696
05:45:51,560 --> 05:45:53,560
How's he doing?

4697
05:45:55,560 --> 05:45:57,560
Um...

4698
05:46:15,560 --> 05:46:17,560
Two? Two?

4699
05:46:17,560 --> 05:46:19,560
What if I say the first one?

4700
05:46:21,560 --> 05:46:23,560
What if I say the first one?

4701
05:46:23,560 --> 05:46:25,560
Will I get in trouble? Will I die?

4702
05:46:29,560 --> 05:46:31,560
I should save first.

4703
05:46:31,560 --> 05:46:33,560
No, I can't save right now.

4704
05:46:33,560 --> 05:46:35,560
I can't save right now.

4705
05:46:43,560 --> 05:46:45,560
Okay, fine.

4706
05:46:45,560 --> 05:46:47,560
First one, first one.

4707
05:46:55,560 --> 05:46:57,560
He didn't care.

4708
05:47:03,560 --> 05:47:05,560
He didn't care.

4709
05:47:29,560 --> 05:47:31,560
He didn't care.

4710
05:47:31,560 --> 05:47:33,560
He didn't care.

4711
05:47:41,560 --> 05:47:43,560
Wait, why is it nighttime already?

4712
05:47:47,560 --> 05:47:49,560
Did I, did I...

4713
05:47:49,560 --> 05:47:51,560
I didn't even get the firefighter stuff.

4714
05:47:51,560 --> 05:47:53,560
Wait.

4715
05:47:53,560 --> 05:47:55,560
Stop, Steve.

4716
05:48:21,560 --> 05:48:23,560
Dead.

4717
05:48:23,560 --> 05:48:25,560
Dead.

4718
05:48:47,560 --> 05:48:49,560
Yes.

4719
05:48:51,560 --> 05:48:53,560
Yeah, you gonna rat on me?

4720
05:49:17,560 --> 05:49:19,560
Here?

4721
05:49:21,560 --> 05:49:23,560
Yeah.

4722
05:49:35,560 --> 05:49:37,560
Somewhere, huh?

4723
05:49:37,560 --> 05:49:39,560
Darkness vaults.

4724
05:49:39,560 --> 05:49:41,560
I forgot what he said.

4725
05:49:51,560 --> 05:49:53,560
Huh.

4726
05:50:03,560 --> 05:50:05,560
Okay, fine.

4727
05:50:09,560 --> 05:50:11,560
Huh!

4728
05:50:21,560 --> 05:50:23,560
Well, that didn't work.

4729
05:50:23,560 --> 05:50:25,560
All right.

4730
05:50:39,560 --> 05:50:41,560
Can I turn it off now?

4731
05:50:41,560 --> 05:50:43,560
Do I have it?

4732
05:50:51,560 --> 05:50:53,560
Yeah, I got it.

4733
05:50:53,560 --> 05:50:55,560
Thanks.

4734
05:51:03,560 --> 05:51:05,560
Okay, I'm gonna go.

4735
05:51:05,560 --> 05:51:07,560
I'm gonna go now.

4736
05:51:11,560 --> 05:51:13,560
Uh, see ya.

4737
05:51:21,560 --> 05:51:23,560
This game is so crunchy.

4738
05:51:23,560 --> 05:51:27,560
Well, this game is from what year was this game out?

4739
05:51:29,560 --> 05:51:31,560
When year did this game come out?

4740
05:51:31,560 --> 05:51:33,560
Arvester game.

4741
05:51:37,560 --> 05:51:39,560
1996.

4742
05:51:39,560 --> 05:51:41,560
Okay.

4743
05:51:41,560 --> 05:51:43,560
It's old.

4744
05:51:43,560 --> 05:51:45,560
I can't believe.

4745
05:51:45,560 --> 05:51:47,560
He sleeps in jeans.

4746
05:51:47,560 --> 05:51:49,560
Steve sleeps in jeans.

4747
05:51:51,560 --> 05:51:53,560
Yes.

4748
05:51:53,560 --> 05:52:03,560
What do you people want from me?

4749
05:52:03,560 --> 05:52:15,560
Welcome to our Horde, the land that grips the life of its death.

4750
05:52:15,560 --> 05:52:17,560
Stephanie.

4751
05:52:17,560 --> 05:52:25,560
1996 is old? Do you know when the internet was made?

4752
05:52:25,560 --> 05:52:29,560
Senpai. Do you know when the internet was made?

4753
05:52:29,560 --> 05:52:33,560
When the internet went public?

4754
05:52:33,560 --> 05:52:43,560
95. This is one year after. Okay?

4755
05:52:43,560 --> 05:52:45,560
Oh my gosh.

4756
05:52:45,560 --> 05:52:49,560
Well, we're gonna save here.

4757
05:52:49,560 --> 05:52:55,560
I'm tired.

4758
05:52:55,560 --> 05:53:03,560
I'm tired, and I think I want to take a nap.

4759
05:53:03,560 --> 05:53:07,560
Well, a big sleep.

4760
05:53:07,560 --> 05:53:17,560
I want to take a big sleep.

4761
05:53:17,560 --> 05:53:23,560
I think about...

4762
05:53:23,560 --> 05:53:31,560
Don't look Senpai. Don't look at my steam. Don't look.

4763
05:53:31,560 --> 05:53:41,560
I don't know why it does that.

4764
05:53:41,560 --> 05:53:51,560
Okay.

4765
05:53:51,560 --> 05:53:57,560
Alright. Senpai.

4766
05:53:57,560 --> 05:54:07,560
This tomorrow will be the end, officially the end of the first week since debut.

4767
05:54:07,560 --> 05:54:13,560
Tomorrow I'll be playing Death Mark.

4768
05:54:13,560 --> 05:54:17,560
So...

4769
05:54:17,560 --> 05:54:29,560
And that will be probably the final of the genre of games that I like the most.

4770
05:54:29,560 --> 05:54:41,560
And that is the preview of all facets of me, Mercy Modest.

4771
05:54:41,560 --> 05:54:51,560
So, you can, as you saw, those were all games that I particularly...

4772
05:54:51,560 --> 05:54:55,560
genre of games that I particularly like. I feel like...

4773
05:54:55,560 --> 05:55:03,560
I feel like my point-and-click love really shone through in today's stream.

4774
05:55:03,560 --> 05:55:08,560
So, I think that this is probably a good one.

4775
05:55:08,560 --> 05:55:14,560
Honestly, I'm super invested. This is why I love point-and-clicks.

4776
05:55:14,560 --> 05:55:20,560
I really love point-and-clicks because they are definitely a genre I really love.

4777
05:55:20,560 --> 05:55:26,560
It's a genre that I grew up with. It's a genre where it's a lot of storytelling

4778
05:55:26,560 --> 05:55:36,560
and a lot of problem solving, and that's like some things that I really like.

4779
05:55:36,560 --> 05:55:40,560
So, honestly, I want to play more point-and-clicks.

4780
05:55:40,560 --> 05:55:44,560
We're definitely going to return to Harvester, hopefully.

4781
05:55:44,560 --> 05:55:54,560
When I stream it next time, I can finish it, hopefully.

4782
05:55:54,560 --> 05:56:02,560
And yeah, I played a lot of point-and-clicks. I played a lot of point-and-clicks. A lot.

4783
05:56:02,560 --> 05:56:10,560
So, if there's a chance I can play another one for Senpai's, I think I'll be great.

4784
05:56:20,560 --> 05:56:24,560
Will you be playing Miss Slash the Riven series? I'm not sure.

4785
05:56:24,560 --> 05:56:30,560
Miss is kind of 3D, right? I might. I might.

4786
05:56:32,560 --> 05:56:36,560
Oh, what else?

4787
05:56:36,560 --> 05:56:48,560
I might take a day off my schedule for next week's stream simply because I'm really exhausted Senpai.

4788
05:56:48,560 --> 05:56:54,560
A week of full streaming, no breaks. I'm really exhausted Senpai.

4789
05:56:54,560 --> 05:57:04,560
Tomorrow, yeah, we're playing Death Mark, which is a visual novel game.

4790
05:57:04,560 --> 05:57:14,560
I played it a bit, but I took a huge break from it, so it will feel like starting fresh again.

4791
05:57:14,560 --> 05:57:22,560
And I don't remember a lot of the puzzles or the gameplay, so we should be fine.

4792
05:57:23,560 --> 05:57:25,560
What else? What else?

4793
05:57:25,560 --> 05:57:36,560
Oh yeah, and tomorrow, I probably won't be late, but I'm really looking forward to it because my IRL friends are going to treat me to sushi

4794
05:57:36,560 --> 05:57:43,560
because they're like, congratulations on getting into Fialor, so I'm very happy.

4795
05:57:44,560 --> 05:57:54,560
I'm very happy that I can go meet out with my friends, but I probably am going to cut it short so I can come back and stream.

4796
05:58:00,560 --> 05:58:03,560
Are you going to be altering the times you stream? No.

4797
05:58:03,560 --> 05:58:21,560
Now, Fialor has kind of divided everyone into certain time slots to cover a variety of time zones, and I've taken over this time slot.

4798
05:58:21,560 --> 05:58:30,560
So unfortunately, I will be streaming all my streams to be at the same time, will start at the same time every time.

4799
05:58:34,560 --> 05:58:48,560
I'll see, except for, I think, when there are collabs, when there are collabs or special occasions, then I think the time is going to be a little bit more off.

4800
05:58:51,560 --> 05:59:00,560
Unfortunately, is it not a good time for you? I worry it's not a good time for senpais, because I know there are some senpais that want to catch me,

4801
05:59:00,560 --> 05:59:06,560
but unfortunately, I'm not matching their time zones. I hope that makes sense.

4802
05:59:06,560 --> 05:59:12,560
This makes me a little sad that some senpais won't be able to watch me.

4803
05:59:12,560 --> 05:59:26,560
I'd really like to cater to awesome pies, but at the same time, I don't want to overlap completely with my gen mates as well.

4804
05:59:26,560 --> 05:59:36,560
And we all start at certain times, which makes us available, like all of us available for our certain times.

4805
05:59:39,560 --> 05:59:47,560
So I feel bad that some senpais will be left out, which is why I say that.

4806
05:59:48,560 --> 06:00:06,560
So I still hope that the senpais that can't catch me will catch the vods, although I think there's something a little special about seeing things live,

4807
06:00:07,560 --> 06:00:14,560
which is why I feel a little sad, and that's why I say, unfortunately, instead of I'm glad.

4808
06:00:14,560 --> 06:00:20,560
I am glad that I get to have a time slot where I can do a lot of things in the daytime

4809
06:00:20,560 --> 06:00:35,560
and like be able to hang out with mama and papa and do my chores and just get ready for the day for stream.

4810
06:00:35,560 --> 06:00:45,560
And then at night time, I can stream and be like entertaining and I can be with my senpais.

4811
06:00:46,560 --> 06:01:03,560
But yeah, I feel a little bad that I can't cater to everyone, but I don't want to step on anyone's toes for their specific time slots as well.

4812
06:01:03,560 --> 06:01:14,560
I picked this time because it's the time where I'm kind of used to as well.

4813
06:01:15,560 --> 06:01:27,560
Yeah, at the end of the day, time zones are hard work for everyone.

4814
06:01:27,560 --> 06:01:29,560
Yeah, I'll try my best.

4815
06:01:29,560 --> 06:01:35,560
Maybe one day I'll schedule in some earlier streams, but once again, I kind of don't want to step on toes,

4816
06:01:35,560 --> 06:01:45,560
but I'll ask management if there's like a day where there's not a lot of, if many of my gen mates are having time off or something,

4817
06:01:45,560 --> 06:01:53,560
I can slip in a earlier stream.

4818
06:01:54,560 --> 06:02:06,560
I want everyone to enjoy Mercy Modi's.

4819
06:02:06,560 --> 06:02:19,560
Gorilla, I don't want to do gorilla all too much because I feel like if I do a gorilla stream that there are going to be some people who miss out and then they'll feel bad about it.

4820
06:02:19,560 --> 06:02:26,560
They'll feel like they've been left out, you know?

4821
06:02:26,560 --> 06:02:31,560
That's my feel on it.

4822
06:02:31,560 --> 06:02:39,560
I know that my gen mates will do it, but I feel like...

4823
06:02:39,560 --> 06:02:41,560
What is a gorilla stream?

4824
06:02:41,560 --> 06:02:46,560
It's a stream that's unannounced, so I just go on in the stream, you know?

4825
06:02:46,560 --> 06:02:57,560
Like, surprise! It's not on the schedule, but here we go!

4826
06:02:57,560 --> 06:03:07,560
So, I don't want my senpais to be like, I missed it! No! Or I didn't know she was doing that stream!

4827
06:03:07,560 --> 06:03:13,560
I don't want senpais to feel left out, so I'd rather schedule it.

4828
06:03:13,560 --> 06:03:27,560
If senpais really wanted to watch it, they can plan around it.

4829
06:03:27,560 --> 06:03:38,560
I feel like my gen mates are free to do what they want, but this is my own personal belief.

4830
06:03:38,560 --> 06:03:46,560
That's my opinion. It's my own personal belief, so don't think that the way that I think is going to be the way my gen mates think.

4831
06:03:46,560 --> 06:03:56,560
I'm very much a traditionalist in a way, so for example, my gen mates, they are free to talk about past lives and stuff,

4832
06:03:56,560 --> 06:04:03,560
but I'm definitely not a person who wants to discuss it, but not discuss my own personal past life.

4833
06:04:03,560 --> 06:04:17,560
I don't mind if they talk to me about their past lives, but I don't want to talk about my past life type of thing.

4834
06:04:17,560 --> 06:04:32,560
And I think the only times I'll ever do a gorilla stream is if I'm on vacation, but even then I'll feel bad for senpais who missed it, you know?

4835
06:04:33,560 --> 06:04:53,560
I know there's a lot of freedom and stuff within violor, but I'm still in kind of the idol mindset.

4836
06:04:53,560 --> 06:04:56,560
I'm very much in the idol mindset.

4837
06:05:03,560 --> 06:05:17,560
I don't know if there's like, you know, if there's a market for like an arrow idol.

4838
06:05:17,560 --> 06:05:37,560
But yeah, I think, I think, yeah, I'm very much pretty much a traditionalist.

4839
06:05:37,560 --> 06:05:42,560
I follow the JP formula a lot.

4840
06:05:48,560 --> 06:05:54,560
I hope that, honestly, I'm kind of like Strani.

4841
06:05:54,560 --> 06:06:01,560
I kind of want to have like the idol, the idol outfits, like the idol concert type of thing.

4842
06:06:01,560 --> 06:06:17,560
I know it's not traditional and some people might be very opposed to it.

4843
06:06:17,560 --> 06:06:18,560
Yeah.

4844
06:06:21,560 --> 06:06:27,560
Some people might be opposed to it, but it's kind of like, it's kind of my dream.

4845
06:06:27,560 --> 06:06:28,560
Senpai.

4846
06:06:28,560 --> 06:06:35,560
You know, it's a little bit of my dream to try to pursue being an idol.

4847
06:06:35,560 --> 06:06:37,560
Just a little bit.

4848
06:06:37,560 --> 06:06:44,560
It doesn't have to be completely, since all paths are strange.

4849
06:06:47,560 --> 06:06:55,560
But you know, ever since I watched Creamy Mami, I was like, I love this, I love this so much.

4850
06:06:58,560 --> 06:07:18,560
But my number one dream is, of course, to like, make my Senpai's happy and smile.

4851
06:07:18,560 --> 06:07:20,560
I really like, I really like that show, though.

4852
06:07:20,560 --> 06:07:22,560
I love the song.

4853
06:07:29,560 --> 06:07:33,560
Any specific idol outfits you like?

4854
06:07:33,560 --> 06:07:40,560
I kind of like the, they're all kind of like marching band slash military-esque.

4855
06:07:40,560 --> 06:07:45,560
I kind of like the pastel colored ones.

4856
06:07:45,560 --> 06:07:58,560
And the ones that are like, the one that are kind of poofy, like poofy skirts.

4857
06:07:58,560 --> 06:08:01,560
Thank you, Anonymous, for the 420.

4858
06:08:01,560 --> 06:08:05,560
Yeah, blaze it, or whatever them kids say.

4859
06:08:11,560 --> 06:08:13,560
What do you mean, peculiar aesthetics?

4860
06:08:13,560 --> 06:08:15,560
It's just the idol look.

4861
06:08:20,560 --> 06:08:22,560
It's just the idol look.

4862
06:08:25,560 --> 06:08:27,560
Creamy Mami will be our next home marker.

4863
06:08:27,560 --> 06:08:28,560
No, no, no.

4864
06:08:28,560 --> 06:08:41,560
I think Creamy Mami will be too long for, and I think Creamy Mami is also a little bit harder to digest for Senpai's because of its age.

4865
06:08:41,560 --> 06:08:46,560
Being a very early Magical Girl series, it's also very long.

4866
06:08:46,560 --> 06:08:57,560
So I feel Cardcaptor Sakura is digestible and that it can be marathoned, but Creamy Mami, I don't think, is a marathonable.

4867
06:08:59,560 --> 06:09:01,560
Not Minky Momo.

4868
06:09:03,560 --> 06:09:10,560
Minky Momo is, it was definitely a wild ride.

4869
06:09:11,560 --> 06:09:26,560
But I feel like Cardcaptor Sakura is kind of one of the things that I really appreciate.

4870
06:09:26,560 --> 06:09:45,560
I won't lie to Senpai's, but Cardcaptor Sakura literally got me through some really hard times.

4871
06:09:45,560 --> 06:09:47,560
She literally saved my life.

4872
06:09:47,560 --> 06:09:54,560
Oh hi, look up the Curse of Minky Momo.

4873
06:09:54,560 --> 06:09:57,560
I already know the Curse of Minky Momo.

4874
06:09:59,560 --> 06:10:02,560
I already know the Curse of Minky Momo.

4875
06:10:08,560 --> 06:10:11,560
I know, I know it, I know it.

4876
06:10:12,560 --> 06:10:21,560
And if you, if Senpai's don't know it, just, I think, who's the YouTuber that covers it very well?

4877
06:10:21,560 --> 06:10:23,560
Kenny Lauderdale?

4878
06:10:23,560 --> 06:10:27,560
Yeah, that YouTuber covers it quite well.

4879
06:10:27,560 --> 06:10:44,560
The original, right? Not the Novana dub. I actually grew up with the Novana dub, but I love the original.

4880
06:10:44,560 --> 06:10:48,560
I think both of them are really good, actually.

4881
06:10:48,560 --> 06:10:56,560
The Novana dub, people are like, oh, it's bad, whatever. I think it's still a little bit, I think, despite it being a dub,

4882
06:10:56,560 --> 06:11:00,560
I feel like this voice is suited the characters quite well.

4883
06:11:08,560 --> 06:11:14,560
But Sakura has a saying that she keeps on like a mantra that she says,

4884
06:11:14,560 --> 06:11:21,560
and I've used that mantra to get through hard times a lot, which is, surely everything will be alright.

4885
06:11:27,560 --> 06:11:30,560
So that's gotten me through, like, really tough times.

4886
06:11:36,560 --> 06:11:40,560
Truly, surely, whatever, it's the same, it's the same mantra.

4887
06:11:45,560 --> 06:11:49,560
So, yeah, Cardcaptor Sakura literally saved my life.

4888
06:11:49,560 --> 06:11:51,560
So, uh...

4889
06:11:55,560 --> 06:11:57,560
So, Senpai's will have to watch it, too.

4890
06:11:58,560 --> 06:11:59,560
Understood?

4891
06:12:01,560 --> 06:12:15,560
Actually, the other day, I went to GameStop and I saw the clown wand, and I was like, oh, so I got it.

4892
06:12:15,560 --> 06:12:19,560
I got the wand, it's right underneath my desk.

4893
06:12:26,560 --> 06:12:28,560
You don't have to watch Clear Card.

4894
06:12:28,560 --> 06:12:34,560
I think for Senpai's homework would be just Season 1, Season 2, and then the two movies.

4895
06:12:35,560 --> 06:12:46,560
So, the two movies will be the Cardcaptor Sakura, the movie, and then Cardcaptor Sakura, the sealed card.

4896
06:12:46,560 --> 06:12:48,560
That'll be the second movie.

4897
06:12:57,560 --> 06:13:00,560
So, yeah, I ended up buying the wand.

4898
06:13:01,560 --> 06:13:15,560
A few years ago, my friends funded, put together some money, and then they got me the Sakura wand, you know, the Star Wand.

4899
06:13:18,560 --> 06:13:21,560
They got me the Star Wand, and I was like, yeah!

4900
06:13:22,560 --> 06:13:25,560
My wand, my angel's wand!

4901
06:13:26,560 --> 06:13:32,560
Well, you ever have Movie Night in a Discord?

4902
06:13:32,560 --> 06:13:34,560
Um, there's no Discord.

4903
06:13:35,560 --> 06:13:39,560
There's fan Discord, but there's no Discord.

4904
06:13:40,560 --> 06:13:41,560
Sorry.

4905
06:13:44,560 --> 06:13:46,560
Did you do a pose with it before?

4906
06:13:46,560 --> 06:13:48,560
Oh, yeah, I did.

4907
06:13:48,560 --> 06:13:56,560
I did like the classic little, like, heal, heal down, and she, like, does the, when she captures a card.

4908
06:14:03,560 --> 06:14:04,560
Did we use Discord?

4909
06:14:04,560 --> 06:14:12,560
Yeah, we have a work Discord, and the Discord for work we can also chat in, but not a, like, official fan Discord.

4910
06:14:12,560 --> 06:14:20,560
There's a, I think there's a Discord just for stream announcements, too.

4911
06:14:30,560 --> 06:14:32,560
I don't think it would happen, though.

4912
06:14:32,560 --> 06:14:36,560
I don't think a Discord where the girls are in will happen.

4913
06:14:36,560 --> 06:14:38,560
Simply because of safety reasons.

4914
06:14:39,560 --> 06:14:41,560
Because of safety reasons, Senpai.

4915
06:14:50,560 --> 06:14:52,560
There's a...

4916
06:14:54,560 --> 06:15:02,560
I'm not saying you, Senpai, will use it maliciously, but there are lots of other people who will use it maliciously.

4917
06:15:02,560 --> 06:15:06,560
Which is why, um...

4918
06:15:09,560 --> 06:15:21,560
Which is why we probably won't have a Discord, but we can interact with you through stream, YouTube comments, Maros, and on Twitter.

4919
06:15:21,560 --> 06:15:36,560
So there's lots of avenues to, um, talk to, to talk to us as well.

4920
06:15:36,560 --> 06:15:45,560
We might not always reply simply because there's just a lot of messages, but I'm always thankful.

4921
06:15:46,560 --> 06:15:54,560
And I'm sure that my gen mates were also very thankful for all the kind messages that everyone leaves as well.

4922
06:16:01,560 --> 06:16:08,560
So yeah, I might not always respond, but I will, I do, I do see it.

4923
06:16:12,560 --> 06:16:13,560
I do see it.

4924
06:16:14,560 --> 06:16:16,560
Yeah, Lori Kostrani's home for sad girls.

4925
06:16:18,560 --> 06:16:20,560
I think we're very happy now, actually.

4926
06:16:22,560 --> 06:16:24,560
We're very happy.

4927
06:16:25,560 --> 06:16:32,560
I mean, like, let's be real, though. If you're a VTuber, you have some kind of metal Illinois.

4928
06:16:44,560 --> 06:16:46,560
But...

4929
06:17:01,560 --> 06:17:04,560
But, uh, it's definitely...

4930
06:17:05,560 --> 06:17:10,560
All of us have our struggles, but, you know, we're here to entertain.

4931
06:17:10,560 --> 06:17:12,560
In the end, we're here to entertain.

4932
06:17:12,560 --> 06:17:22,560
And VLR has six wonderful talents for everyone to indulge in.

4933
06:17:23,560 --> 06:17:26,560
I'm trying to wink, but I have an eye patch.

4934
06:17:27,560 --> 06:17:28,560
Hahaha.

4935
06:17:33,560 --> 06:17:35,560
You need an account to send in tomorrow?

4936
06:17:35,560 --> 06:17:45,560
Uh, not necessarily, but if you want any of the girls, including myself, to reply, there's a chance that we'll reply privately.

4937
06:17:45,560 --> 06:17:52,560
So if you want to be responded to privately, that would be, uh, you need an account.

4938
06:17:53,560 --> 06:17:55,560
Hahaha.

4939
06:17:58,560 --> 06:18:07,560
But if you don't mind the question just being, like, posted publicly on, like, the Mara Wall, then that's it.

4940
06:18:09,560 --> 06:18:12,560
Sometimes I don't respond. I'm not...

4941
06:18:13,560 --> 06:18:24,560
Because I feel like if I say thank you over and over, I just sound like a broken record, and I feel like I don't want to fill the Mara Wall completely with all my thank you.

4942
06:18:24,560 --> 06:18:31,560
So I keep the Maros that are, like, compliments and saying nice things close to my heart instead.

4943
06:18:31,560 --> 06:18:32,560
Hahaha.

4944
06:18:34,560 --> 06:18:47,560
Also, yes, it's anonymous so that, um, so that there's still kind of a safety barrier for not only you, Senpai, but for us as well.

4945
06:18:51,560 --> 06:18:52,560
Oh, yeah.

4946
06:18:52,560 --> 06:18:53,560
Haha.

4947
06:18:59,560 --> 06:19:09,560
So yeah, you...there's many avenues in which you can interact with us, so it's not too bad.

4948
06:19:09,560 --> 06:19:11,560
It's not too bad, even if we don't have a Discord.

4949
06:19:11,560 --> 06:19:14,560
But yeah, no Discord is a safety thing.

4950
06:19:14,560 --> 06:19:16,560
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

4951
06:19:21,560 --> 06:19:24,560
So I think that's it. I think that's it.

4952
06:19:24,560 --> 06:19:25,560
Hmm.

4953
06:19:25,560 --> 06:19:27,560
I say any more questions, Senpai.

4954
06:19:27,560 --> 06:19:35,560
I'm willing to answer maybe a couple more if any any questions about Villalor, uh, props up.

4955
06:19:35,560 --> 06:19:46,560
If not, I think we're done for today. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4956
06:19:51,560 --> 06:19:54,560
I just feel the stream for six hours again, all high.

4957
06:19:54,560 --> 06:19:57,560
Well, it feels like it's gonna be probably the norm.

4958
06:19:59,560 --> 06:20:02,560
I just considered the powerhouse of the south of the mitochondria.

4959
06:20:02,560 --> 06:20:04,560
Hahaha.

4960
06:20:11,560 --> 06:20:14,560
Will you be Justin Idol or a magical girl idol?

4961
06:20:14,560 --> 06:20:18,560
Probably Justin Idol, a regular idol.

4962
06:20:18,560 --> 06:20:22,560
Oh, by the way, what's today's English word? Right.

4963
06:20:22,560 --> 06:20:40,560
Because, because mama, mama, those sort of things that your student sort of, but like has recently called you fans.

4964
06:20:40,560 --> 06:20:42,560
Let me think.

4965
06:20:48,560 --> 06:21:17,560
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I don't want to use another D word, even though D words, uh,

4966
06:21:17,560 --> 06:21:26,560
D words, D words are, D words are always on the mind.

4967
06:21:26,560 --> 06:21:39,560
How about. Hmm. Meek.

4968
06:21:39,560 --> 06:21:45,560
Let's see, let's use the word meek today.

4969
06:21:45,560 --> 06:21:50,560
M-E-E-K. Meek.

4970
06:21:50,560 --> 06:21:53,560
Quiet, gentle and easily imposed on.

4971
06:21:53,560 --> 06:21:56,560
Use it in a sentence.

4972
06:22:00,560 --> 06:22:05,560
Use it in a sentence is, you know.

4973
06:22:05,560 --> 06:22:11,560
Um, Mercy Maudiste is sometimes very meek.

4974
06:22:12,560 --> 06:22:18,560
Hahaha.

4975
06:22:29,560 --> 06:22:32,560
Yeah, that's our word of the day.

4976
06:22:32,560 --> 06:22:37,560
Thank you for joining me, Senpai.

4977
06:22:37,560 --> 06:22:44,560
And I hope to see you again awfully tomorrow. Okay?

4978
06:22:44,560 --> 06:22:48,560
Hehehe.

4979
06:22:48,560 --> 06:22:53,560
Are you ready?

4980
06:22:53,560 --> 06:22:56,560
Wait, wait, I forgot to say, are you ready?

4981
06:22:56,560 --> 06:22:59,560
But then I was like, can I, can I raid someone?

4982
06:22:59,560 --> 06:23:02,560
I think it's very light, so I don't have anyone to raid into.

4983
06:23:02,560 --> 06:23:05,560
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I don't have anyone to raid into.

4984
06:23:05,560 --> 06:23:08,560
So, it's just gonna be the end of the stream now.

4985
06:23:08,560 --> 06:23:10,560
So, ready?

4986
06:23:10,560 --> 06:23:12,560
One more time.

4987
06:23:12,560 --> 06:23:14,560
Ah, ah, ah.

4988
06:23:14,560 --> 06:23:16,560
Stream for Mercy!

4989
06:23:16,560 --> 06:23:18,560
Bye-bye!

4990
06:23:18,560 --> 06:23:21,560
Mwah!

4991
06:23:21,560 --> 06:23:24,560
Where is it? There it is.

4992
06:23:35,560 --> 06:23:38,560
Mwah!
