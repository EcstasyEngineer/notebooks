WEBVTT

05:30.000 --> 05:50.000
Oops, let me turn this off.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
My music off.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Senpais!

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Don't spoil the game!

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh shit, you can see my steam library, fuck.

06:07.000 --> 06:22.000
Ahhhh.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
Give us a second.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Why aren't you doing DOS?

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
Why aren't you doing the DOS box?

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
There it is.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Let's make this a little bit smaller.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
I set you up to be

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
1920 by 1080.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
You stupid game.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
You stupid game.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It's okay.

07:04.000 --> 07:16.000
Welcome Senpais to the stream!

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I've literally, literally

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
set this up so hard.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I've saved it.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I went into the like configuration settings,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
changed everything,

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
and it's still being a little whole.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Anyways, for those who don't know

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
anything about Harvest Starter,

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
it is a game made basically as a

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
protest against censorship.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
So what you're going to see is, of course,

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
a lot of maybe edgier stuff.

07:58.000 --> 08:10.000
You might see me canceled in like a day or two, who knows.

08:10.000 --> 08:21.000
It's very famous for being quite out there.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I still hear the background.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh shit.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
I was so caught up on seeing,

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
on making this work that I didn't realize.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
There you go.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Wrong one.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Wrong one.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
There we go.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You just missed a little bit of the opening.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
We can watch it again.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Just kidding.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
So this is the hatred of past generations.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
There's a lot of games and movies

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
and even animes back in the 90s

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
that were protest against censorship.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
A famous one, a famous anime,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
that some of my senpais might know,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
it's called General Cyber,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
which is, which dubs itself

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
as the most violent anime ever made.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
It's also a protest against censorship as well.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
So make sure.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
So games of this time,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
the censorship was, of course,

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
due to the...

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
I think basically the scare where every...

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Oh gosh, it's been a while since I did this study.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
But at this point, it'll be games that are evil

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
and makes your kids satanists

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
and makes your kids all bad and stuff.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
And so here, you can just say moral panic.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Mercy, thank you.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Everyone is up in arms about video games.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
So what do they do?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
They go,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
what if we can make it worse?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
What if we can make it worse?

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
So here we are with Arvester.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Oh come on, there we go.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
Actually, let me move my screen a little bit for me.

11:09.000 --> 11:17.000
I've set you up to be like the perfect ratio,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
and now it's still windowed.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Can you believe it?

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
So pretty much,

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
I think this was the time when people saw...

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
I need to remember, mind you,

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
I did this study a couple, a few years ago.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
So this was a long time ago, so my memory is still shot.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
But this is probably like...

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Was it Nightcrawler?

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Nightcrawler, kind of like scare moral panic there.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Where, you know, Nightcrawler is like a bunch of creeper,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
like ninja things.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Night trap, yes.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Not Nightcrawler.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah, Nighttrap, where a bunch of ninja things

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
are coming in for these girls' sleepovers.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Did you tweet you are alive?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
No?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I guess I'll go do that now, Senpai.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I guess I'll do that now, Senpai.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I can't believe.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I always forget.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
I think I'm still in the mindset of...

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Hold on, I need to get the...

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
What do you call it?

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
The thumbnail, and then I gotta...

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And then I'll post it up.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I have to go to the waiting room and everything.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Not the waiting room, the stream.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
And post it up too.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh boy, I reminded myself earlier, I'll do it.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
And then I got distracted by pretzels.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
I got distracted by chocolate-covered pretzels.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
So I ate a few.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
And a piece of cheese.

13:47.000 --> 13:57.000
Okay, give me a second.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Sorry, Senpais.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
I think I'm still not quite used to being...

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Being, you know, here.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Let's go to my YouTube studio.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Content.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And let's do...

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Get a shareable link.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Post it right there.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Remove the HTTPS.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Right here.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Am I on the right account? Check.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Oh.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Somebody posted tag me and something, gotta retweet it.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
We'll reply to it later.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
There we go!

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Yay!

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I always forget.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I always forget, because...

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
I don't want to go much into my past life.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
Because I want to keep my past life on the down low.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
But...

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
You know, back then I never really made a schedule and just went,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I want to play!

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
I want to play this! Let's go! Bam!

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
But yeah, I prefer to keep my past life on the down low,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
but since we're allowed in VLOR, just by the way,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
we are allowed to talk about our past life in VLOR.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I just want to keep it on the DL,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
because, essentially...

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Essentially, we are different people.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
Now I have to schedule entire weeks beforehand.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Hi, Mercy. What's being harvested?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I'm not sure.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
But right now, I'm bringing it up just to tell you why.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
To tell you why, I haven't exactly gotten used to...

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
used to pulsing up that I'm live or anything.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
It's like...

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
What? What? What do you mean, Mercy?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Why are you saying Mercy?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
SEMPAI!

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Speak!

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Okay.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Let's show tips.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Use the right mouse button to attack an opponent.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Okay.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
Left click on your character or press I to view inventory.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Left click on an object to grab it,

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
and right click to put it in inventory.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
A penny saved is hardly worth the effort.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
Use the left mouse button to move your character around the screen.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
If you're stuck on a puzzle, talk to other characters,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
and they will give you clues.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Avoid cliches like the plague.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Ammunition is precious, so don't waste it.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
If you get stuck in a puzzle, try using items in crazy, illogical ways.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Okay, yeah, that's... that's part...

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
That's part of the...

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
That's part of point and click, so let's be real.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Save your game often,

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
especially before trying something crazy, illogical, or dangerous.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
Holding down the control button plus the arrow keys allow you to attack opponents.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Look before you leap.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
The help screen can be helpful, or better yet, read the manual.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Speaking of, I haven't read the manual.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
It's a point and click with combat, it seems.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
You can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
but you can't pick your friend's nose.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Oh yeah, bet!

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
This has a manual. Yeah, it looks like it has a manual.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I can pull it up, probably.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I'd have to... have to pull it up, though.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I'd have to... have to pull it up, though.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
Right clicking on objects in inventory shows a close-up of that object.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
Right clicking on weapons in inventory activates and deactivates them.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Press escape to bring up menu options.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
You can combine objects into new objects by clicking and dragging items on one another.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Sound levels can be adjusted in the options menu.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Screen too dark, try adjusting the gamma on the option menu.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Check your photo on the inventory screen.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
It will get worse as you take more damage.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Look for special items that will restore your health.

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
After finding required items during the day, night will be the time of mischievous adventure.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
Double-click the left mouse button on an exit to go through instantly.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Use the right mouse button to attack an opponent.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh wait, okay, whatever, we're going back in circles now.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Thank you!

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Let's look around!

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
A pair of plastic binoculars with lenses melted onto the table.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
How hot is it?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
An empty acne medication container.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Ah, we're teens.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
A photo of a beautiful girl blonde about 17 years old.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
A sexy pinup.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
I can't, I can't whistle.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Psst!

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Never mind.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
One of your typical wall clocks.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I've never seen a wall clock like that ever!

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
Paper doll by the mill's brother sits on the turntable.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
You know, like, record players are really popular.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Senpai, do you have a record player?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
The dresser drawer is unlocked.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Open it then!

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
I take a 25 cent piece dated 1952.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Take it.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
Chew marks are visible on the end of this ballpoint pen.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Take it.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
As of yet, the future isn't so bright.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Can I take it?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Is there anything else in here?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
We're good.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
About any other drawers?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Oh no, it's just the one drawer.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Okay.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
You peer through a thin layer of dust at your reflection.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Seven flannel shirts accompanied with matching blue jeans

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
are hanging neatly in the closet.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I have records, but no record player.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I got a tape player.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I have a tape player too!

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
It's like a tape player and radio.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I found it, I found it in the shed.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I found it in the shed.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
It's Bugs Bunny.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
It's got Bugs Bunny on it.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Actually, remember getting this tape player.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Okay, here.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Let's walk, mister.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Oh, what's in the trash can?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
An empty trash can, so clean you can eat from it.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Anything else?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Did this require anything?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh, maybe the drawer?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
No.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
The mattress is speckled with odd stains.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000

Get back into your cages and start watching me!

36:31.000 --> 36:51.320
I did wash my hands, yes I did.

36:51.320 --> 36:58.560
You want to watch me game or what?

36:58.560 --> 36:59.560
Did Marcy pull an Emmy?

Your finger?

37:36.560 --> 37:39.560
Who's mom?

37:39.560 --> 38:03.560
I'm gonna save the game just in case I step out of this room and then I decide to die.

38:03.560 --> 38:25.560
Oh my gosh, a box of crayons and a range rider coloring book.

38:25.560 --> 38:30.560
What's this?

38:30.560 --> 38:34.560
Fine bone china gleams from the mahogany shelves.

Can I look at the crack in the ceiling?

38:37.560 --> 38:39.560

38:39.560 --> 38:44.560
Okay, first off, why is there two fire extinguishers?

38:44.560 --> 38:46.560
A box full of newspapers.

38:46.560 --> 38:51.560
That's a lot of newspapers.

38:51.560 --> 38:56.560
The stunning depiction of the earth made of paper mache.

38:56.560 --> 39:04.560
Not even plastic, okay.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.560
This house is very safety conscious.

39:07.560 --> 39:13.560
Everything was flammable, okay.

39:13.560 --> 39:17.560
What?

39:17.560 --> 39:20.560

39:27.560 --> 39:32.560
Mom.

39:57.560 --> 40:02.560
Mom, Steve is bugging me.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.560
Okay.

40:04.560 --> 40:10.560
Yo, lousy rat.

40:10.560 --> 40:14.560
Listen here, you little shit.

40:14.560 --> 40:23.560
I'm actually the youngest sibling, so I was the little shit.

40:23.560 --> 40:34.560
Steve.

40:34.560 --> 40:42.560
Wow, we have such a short temper.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.560
You always wear a kidder, Steve.

40:45.560 --> 40:49.560
I'm sick.

40:49.560 --> 40:57.560
Uh, tell me about your cowboy show.

40:57.560 --> 41:02.560
On TV?

41:02.560 --> 41:09.560
You think?

41:09.560 --> 41:15.560
Yeah, I think so too.

41:15.560 --> 41:22.560
Blood and guts are needle.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.560
What should I say, Senpai?

41:25.560 --> 41:30.560
Should I be the half full big brother?

41:30.560 --> 41:34.560
Or should I just be like, yeah, you're right.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.560
That's really neat.

41:38.560 --> 41:44.560
You're not too bad for a lousy rat.

41:44.560 --> 41:49.560
It's like they're talking about any.

41:49.560 --> 42:02.560
I said any like a belly button.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.560
Sick.

42:03.560 --> 42:06.560
What's wrong with you?

42:06.560 --> 42:18.560
I'm gonna watch my cowboy show.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.560
So shut up.

42:21.560 --> 42:30.560
Shut up.

42:30.560 --> 42:43.560
Magnesia stuff.

42:43.560 --> 42:47.560
I don't understand.

42:47.560 --> 42:53.560
Okay kid, you're being a lot of stuff.

42:53.560 --> 43:00.560
You're saying you're doing a lot of foreshadowing here.

43:00.560 --> 43:08.560
That I don't know what you're foreshadowing.

43:08.560 --> 43:13.560
Mercy, don't look up any of the names in this game.

43:13.560 --> 43:23.560
Like Steve?

43:23.560 --> 43:25.560
Don't worry.

43:25.560 --> 43:28.560
You want creepy child mode?

43:28.560 --> 43:32.560
You have to sing lullapies very quietly.

43:32.560 --> 43:44.560
Have you noticed that your show...

43:44.560 --> 43:45.560
Oh wait.

43:45.560 --> 43:49.560
I already picked that one.

43:49.560 --> 43:52.560
Alright, it's really neat.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.560
What's this other?

43:54.560 --> 43:56.560
Well, I can type stuff.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.560
Stinky.

43:58.560 --> 44:01.560
Say what?

44:02.560 --> 44:05.560
You're adopted.

44:05.560 --> 44:11.560
Say what?

44:11.560 --> 44:15.560
Ring around the rosy.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.560
You know like...

44:17.560 --> 44:21.560
Rock-a-bye baby on a tree top.

44:21.560 --> 44:25.560
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.

44:25.560 --> 44:29.560
When the bow breaks, the cradle will fall.

44:29.560 --> 44:42.560
And down will come baby, cradle and all.

44:42.560 --> 44:45.560
Is that creepy for you guys?

44:45.560 --> 44:55.560
This baby freaking fell from a tree.

44:55.560 --> 44:56.560
No?

44:56.560 --> 45:05.560
It's not creepy.

45:05.560 --> 45:14.560
I guess like another one you think about it.

45:14.560 --> 45:20.560
You singing it didn't sound creepy.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.560
Mary, Mary, oh contrary.

45:23.560 --> 45:25.560
How does your garden grow?

45:25.560 --> 45:28.560
Have cockroach shells?

45:28.560 --> 45:33.560
And I forgot was...

45:33.560 --> 45:35.560
What's the other flower?

45:35.560 --> 45:38.560
Something rhymes with bells.

45:38.560 --> 45:47.560
And pretty maids all laid in a row.

45:47.560 --> 45:54.560
Wait, did we ask about daddy yet?

45:54.560 --> 45:56.560
Your dad is asleep?

45:56.560 --> 45:59.560
He and mom went at it last night pretty hard.

45:59.560 --> 46:00.560
Wait what?

46:00.560 --> 46:01.560
He stayed in bed.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.560
I saw what she did to him.

46:03.560 --> 46:04.560
It was pretty bad.

46:04.560 --> 46:05.560
What did she...

46:05.560 --> 46:06.560
What is she?

46:06.560 --> 46:07.560
Like you don't know.

46:07.560 --> 46:10.560
I saw you and her on the couch last Wednesday night.

46:10.560 --> 46:13.560
Guess that's why she's grounded now, huh?

46:13.560 --> 46:17.560
Too bad you wouldn't pay me and I had to tell, huh?

46:17.560 --> 46:18.560
What are you talking about?

46:18.560 --> 46:19.560
What girl?

46:19.560 --> 46:20.560
What?

46:20.560 --> 46:21.560
Is there another one too?

46:21.560 --> 46:25.560
Wait till I tell.

46:25.560 --> 46:34.560
Ezra!

46:34.560 --> 46:44.560
Welcome to the stream!

46:44.560 --> 46:46.560
Welcome Raiders!

46:46.560 --> 46:50.560
Welcome to the stream!

46:50.560 --> 46:52.560
Sorry, did I miss that?

46:52.560 --> 46:53.560
But did we just...

46:53.560 --> 46:55.560
You know, did we just f*** our mom?

46:55.560 --> 47:03.560
Or did we f*** someone else?

47:03.560 --> 47:13.560
Ask, ask what?

47:13.560 --> 47:23.560
I have to ask?

47:23.560 --> 47:26.560
No wait, he said something about the couch.

47:26.560 --> 47:33.560
Like I saw you and mom on the couch and I'm like...

47:33.560 --> 47:36.560
Okay fine, I'll ask it right there.

47:36.560 --> 47:39.560
Oh Ezra, you're making me blush.

47:39.560 --> 47:44.560
Oh you're such a kidder.

47:44.560 --> 47:48.560
You're making me blush, Ezra.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.560
Now he just said her.

47:50.560 --> 47:51.560
Her, her.

47:51.560 --> 47:52.560
Okay, her is girl.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
Okay, let me check.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.560
Girl.

47:54.560 --> 47:55.560
Girl.

47:55.560 --> 47:57.560
I don't know what girl you're talking about.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.560
All summer, it's been Stephanie this.

47:59.560 --> 48:00.560
Stephanie that.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.560
And now you don't remember?

48:02.560 --> 48:04.560
You think I'm dumb or something?

48:04.560 --> 48:07.560
No, I just can't remember anything like I said.

48:07.560 --> 48:09.560
Well you better remember quit.

48:09.560 --> 48:11.560
Cause the wedding's in two weeks.

48:11.560 --> 48:12.560
What?

48:12.560 --> 48:16.560
Leave me alone so I can watch TV.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.560
TV?

48:17.560 --> 48:19.560
That's a weird looking television.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.560
Come to think of it, this whole place looks totally retro.

48:21.560 --> 48:23.560
What do you mean retro?

48:23.560 --> 48:25.560
All TVs look alike.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.560
Sure, basically.

48:26.560 --> 48:27.560
You didn't say mom.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.560
This whole fashion clunker.

48:29.560 --> 48:30.560
Whole fashion?

48:30.560 --> 48:32.560
Looks brand new.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.560
Yeah, but look at the tube.

48:34.560 --> 48:35.560
Where's the remote control?

48:35.560 --> 48:36.560
Where's the tube?

48:36.560 --> 48:38.560
What's that?

48:38.560 --> 48:39.560
What's that?

48:39.560 --> 48:41.560
No but I think about it.

48:41.560 --> 48:42.560
I can't remember.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.560
And what was that you said?

48:44.560 --> 48:46.560
I thought retro rockets?

48:46.560 --> 48:49.560
No, retro, it means...

48:49.560 --> 48:51.560
It means...

48:51.560 --> 48:53.560
Oh man, I know what I mean.

48:53.560 --> 48:55.560
That everything here is wrong.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.560
But I can't picture the difference.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.560
And shut up and quit bugging me.

48:59.560 --> 49:03.560
I'm lost in my cowboy show.

49:03.560 --> 49:05.560
What wedding?

49:05.560 --> 49:06.560
Wait, hold on.

49:06.560 --> 49:07.560
What wedding?

49:07.560 --> 49:08.560
First off.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.560
What else?

49:09.560 --> 49:11.560
Well, I...

49:14.560 --> 49:15.560
Yeah, you're right.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.560
It's great.

49:16.560 --> 49:17.560
Okay, shut up.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.560
What wedding?

49:19.560 --> 49:22.560
Say what?

49:22.560 --> 49:25.560
Pick your nose.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.560
I saw the nose wrong.

49:27.560 --> 49:28.560
No.

49:28.560 --> 49:32.560
Say what?

49:32.560 --> 49:33.560
Boop.

49:33.560 --> 49:37.560
Say what?

49:37.560 --> 49:39.560
Adopt it.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.560
Adopt it.

49:41.560 --> 49:42.560
Say what?

49:42.560 --> 49:45.560
You're adopted, kid.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.560
Try Stephanie.

49:48.560 --> 49:51.560
Stephanie.

49:51.560 --> 49:52.560
Say what?

49:52.560 --> 49:54.560
Oh fuck this kid.

49:54.560 --> 49:55.560
Good.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.560
Finally.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.560
Wait till I get my grabby little hands on you.

50:01.560 --> 50:03.560
We're at...

50:10.560 --> 50:12.560
Good.

50:13.560 --> 50:16.560
Let me alone, Claudia.

50:16.560 --> 50:18.560
This is the good part.

50:18.560 --> 50:20.560
I see.

50:20.560 --> 50:23.560
Uh, was it Stephanie Girl?

50:23.560 --> 50:25.560
I don't know what girl you're talking about.

50:25.560 --> 50:26.560
Thank you.

50:26.560 --> 50:29.560
All summer, it's been Stephanie this and Stephanie that.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.560
And now you don't remember?

50:31.560 --> 50:33.560
You think I'm dumb or something?

50:33.560 --> 50:36.560
No, I just can't remember anything, like I said.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.560
Well, you better remember quit.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.560
Because the wedding's in two weeks.

50:40.560 --> 50:41.560
What?

50:41.560 --> 50:44.560
Let me alone so I can watch TV.

50:44.560 --> 50:45.560
Stephanie.

50:45.560 --> 50:49.560
I said I don't want to talk about her anymore.

50:49.560 --> 50:53.560
I said...

50:53.560 --> 50:55.560
All right.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.560
See ya.

50:56.560 --> 50:57.560
Good.

50:57.560 --> 51:00.560
Man, what a bratty brother I have.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.560
Just spank him.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.560
Is that mom?

51:05.560 --> 51:06.560
What's this?

51:06.560 --> 51:10.560
An expertly embroidered old fashioned wall plaque.

51:12.560 --> 51:15.560
Cookies are baking in the oven.

51:20.560 --> 51:23.560
A newborn is sleeping soundly.

51:23.560 --> 51:26.560
A cabinet that smells of dirty diapers.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.560
Dirty diapers?

51:28.560 --> 51:30.560
Shouldn't they be clean?

51:32.560 --> 51:36.560
Have you tried putting the entire English dictionary into the chat box

51:36.560 --> 51:38.560
and tried to trigger everything at once?

51:38.560 --> 51:41.560
I don't think so.

51:41.560 --> 51:44.560
These cookies are hot out of the oven.

51:44.560 --> 51:45.560
All right.

51:54.560 --> 51:56.560
Oh, there is.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.560
Uh-huh.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.560
Oh, he says Josh.

52:19.560 --> 52:21.560
What job?

52:23.560 --> 52:26.560
We've already established this, Steve.

52:34.560 --> 52:36.560
I'm going to fall asleep to Marysie.

52:36.560 --> 52:39.560
You may fall asleep to me.

52:39.560 --> 52:40.560
Hold on.

52:40.560 --> 52:41.560
Mwah.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.560
Now, tuck you in.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.560
Here you go.

52:45.560 --> 52:46.560
I have a sister?

52:46.560 --> 52:47.560
Oh, wait.

52:47.560 --> 52:50.560
Is it the baby?

52:50.560 --> 52:52.560
The baby?

52:52.560 --> 52:54.560
The baby.

52:54.560 --> 52:55.560
OK.

52:55.560 --> 52:56.560
Let's go through all this.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.560
Graduation.

52:58.560 --> 53:01.560
When did we graduate?

53:01.560 --> 53:03.560
Four months ago.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.560
All you need to get a job.

53:08.560 --> 53:12.560
And besides, you can't marry Stephanie if you're going to waste your time going to college.

53:12.560 --> 53:15.560
This is the first time I've ever seen someone say,

53:15.560 --> 53:17.560
don't go to college.

53:17.560 --> 53:19.560
It's a disgrace, but better late than never.

53:19.560 --> 53:22.560
I guess we can thank Stephanie for that.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.560
All right.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.560
This is the first.

53:30.560 --> 53:32.560
All right, Stephanie.

53:33.560 --> 53:35.560
And just who is Stephanie?

53:35.560 --> 53:38.560
Don't you dare toy with that sweet girl.

53:38.560 --> 53:41.560
If you start in on her with all this amnesia poop,

53:41.560 --> 53:45.560
she'll think her fiance is having second thoughts about the wedding.

53:46.560 --> 53:48.560
Wedding?

53:48.560 --> 53:50.560
Look, all this talk about weddings is nuts.

53:50.560 --> 53:53.560
I'm not marrying anybody till I figure out what's going on here.

53:53.560 --> 53:55.560
First, the heartbreak of psoriasis.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.560
Psoriasis?

53:57.560 --> 54:00.560
Two weeks before the wedding and you're backing out.

54:00.560 --> 54:02.560
Whatever will the neighbors think?

54:02.560 --> 54:04.560
I can't marry someone I don't even know.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.560
Fine, have it your way, but leave me out of it.

54:07.560 --> 54:09.560
If you're going to break Stephanie's heart,

54:09.560 --> 54:11.560
you march right next door and do it yourself.

54:11.560 --> 54:14.560
And don't expect me to write you a note.

54:15.560 --> 54:16.560
Okay.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.560
Fiance?

54:17.560 --> 54:18.560
Fiance?

54:18.560 --> 54:19.560
Fiance?

54:19.560 --> 54:20.560
This is insane.

54:20.560 --> 54:23.560
Oh, you're not having second thoughts about marrying Stephanie.

54:23.560 --> 54:26.560
Is that what this silliness is all about?

54:26.560 --> 54:27.560
Pre-wedding jitters?

54:27.560 --> 54:29.560
Can something like that produce amnesia?

54:30.560 --> 54:34.560
Stop this foolishness right now and count your blessings.

54:34.560 --> 54:37.560
Stephanie is great at cooking and cleaning.

54:38.560 --> 54:39.560
Cooking and cleaning?

54:39.560 --> 54:42.560
What's cooking and cleaning got to do with anything?

54:42.560 --> 54:45.560
Honestly, boys are so dense.

54:45.560 --> 54:48.560
What else is there for a wife but cooking and cleaning?

54:48.560 --> 54:51.560
You may not appreciate a hot meal on a clean plate when it's there,

54:51.560 --> 54:55.560
but if it wasn't, we'd hear about it soon enough, I'll bet.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.560
You're saying that's all there is to marriage.

54:57.560 --> 54:58.560
Cooking and cleaning?

54:58.560 --> 54:59.560
No!

54:59.560 --> 55:01.560
You'll have to ask your father about that,

55:01.560 --> 55:04.560
but I'm sure Stephanie will do her duty.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.560
Her duty?

55:07.560 --> 55:09.560
Don't worry so far.

55:09.560 --> 55:12.560
I'll do my duty too when we get married.

55:19.560 --> 55:23.560
Marriage is more than cooking and cleaning.

55:24.560 --> 55:27.560
It's about loving each other

55:27.560 --> 55:31.560
and being there for each other for all of eternity.

55:31.560 --> 55:32.560
Right?

55:38.560 --> 55:39.560
I said right!

55:44.560 --> 55:45.560
Okay.

55:48.560 --> 55:49.560
Good!

55:49.560 --> 55:51.560
So fly, good!

55:53.560 --> 55:55.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

55:56.560 --> 55:58.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

56:05.560 --> 56:06.560
Ha!

56:14.560 --> 56:16.560
Someone say no?

56:19.560 --> 56:22.560
Mom, scut off his testicles!

56:23.560 --> 56:24.560
Are there testicles?

56:24.560 --> 56:25.560
I don't actually know.

56:29.560 --> 56:30.560
Thank you!

56:31.560 --> 56:32.560
Thank you, mods!

56:50.560 --> 56:51.560
You're welcome.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.560
You'll have them back once Emmy wakes up.

57:10.560 --> 57:12.560
Okay, let's talk about our duty.

57:12.560 --> 57:14.560
Or should we talk about our father?

57:14.560 --> 57:15.560
Ha ha, duty.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.560
They grow back?

57:19.560 --> 57:21.560
They always grow back, don't you know?

57:29.560 --> 57:31.560
We should talk about duty, huh?

57:36.560 --> 57:37.560
Disgusting truths.

57:44.560 --> 57:45.560
Lexingogos?

57:49.560 --> 57:50.560
Your baby was Stephanie.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.560
You'll have to make your peace with the fact that

57:52.560 --> 57:54.560
when a farmer plants his seed,

57:54.560 --> 57:57.560
he can't help but get some nasty dirt on his hoe.

57:57.560 --> 57:59.560
Not on his hoe!

58:10.560 --> 58:11.560
Mother!

58:12.560 --> 58:15.560
You can't use such language around here.

58:16.560 --> 58:20.560
We should treasure the love they have.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.560
Or maybe if there's no love.

58:23.560 --> 58:24.560
You know what?

58:24.560 --> 58:26.560
If there's no love, no marriage, okay?

58:26.560 --> 58:29.560
But clearly, there has to be love.

58:29.560 --> 58:31.560
Oh, why goggles?

58:34.560 --> 58:36.560
Goggles is such a strange thing.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.560
You know, like, goggle boots, right?

58:38.560 --> 58:40.560
Like, they're really long boots.

58:41.560 --> 58:44.560
Oh, let's talk about our father now.

58:48.560 --> 58:49.560
My father.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.560
He's in the other room.

58:51.560 --> 58:53.560
He decided to sleep in today.

58:53.560 --> 58:56.560
Now please, let me get back to my cookies.

58:56.560 --> 58:57.560
Cookies?

58:57.560 --> 58:59.560
The bake sale was on Friday,

58:59.560 --> 59:02.560
and yet you're baking the cookies now.

59:02.560 --> 59:05.560
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.

59:05.560 --> 59:07.560
But they'll be stale by then.

59:07.560 --> 59:09.560
That's why I'm throwing them away.

59:09.560 --> 59:11.560
And then cooking more?

59:11.560 --> 59:13.560
To replace the ones I throw out.

59:13.560 --> 59:14.560
Why?

59:14.560 --> 59:15.560
Well, I have to.

59:15.560 --> 59:19.560
No one's going to pay to eat stale cookies out of the garbage can.

59:19.560 --> 59:21.560
But you expect me to?

59:21.560 --> 59:23.560
Of course not, Steve.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.560
I wouldn't charge you.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.560
I'm your mother.

59:25.560 --> 59:26.560
Help yourself.

59:31.560 --> 59:35.560
You would charge me to eat cookies out of the trash can?

59:35.560 --> 59:38.560
You wouldn't have done that, mommy?

59:38.560 --> 59:39.560
All right.

59:39.560 --> 59:42.560
Let's get some garbage cookies.

59:42.560 --> 59:45.560
What charity is this bake sale supposed to benefit?

59:45.560 --> 59:49.560
It'll help provide a fund for bums and hobos who wander into harvest

59:49.560 --> 59:51.560
and have no family ties.

59:51.560 --> 59:53.560
Kind of a specific target group, isn't it?

59:53.560 --> 59:56.560
Yeah, that's pretty specific to detail when dealing with such people.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.560
I don't know what you mean.

59:58.560 --> 59:59.560
You will.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.560
The whole thing has been organized by the lodge.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.560
The lodge?

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.560
The lodge?

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.560
What lodge?

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.560
What's so great about it?

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.560
It sounds like a call.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.560
No one gets inside, but it wouldn't be so exclusive if it wasn't just wonderful.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.560
Just like the new Reynolds dishwasher with their patented auto dry process TM.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.560
I've never used one, but I know I want it.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.560
Instead of sulking around the house all day,

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.560
why not walk over to the lodge and apply for membership?

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.560
The last thing I want is a fizz on my head.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.560
Don't be so hasty, Steve.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.560
I think you'll find harvest is a pretty dull place without the lodge.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.560
You sound like the membership director.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.560
Don't be silly.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.560
I just want what's best for you.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.560
That's all.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.560
Harvest, harvest.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.560
I don't remember the song.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.560
Nice product placement, though.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:30.560
I think my dishwasher is over 20 years old.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:44.560
Harvest is a town unlike any you've ever known.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.560
In what way?

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.560
Yeah.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.560
I don't have time to go into it now.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.560
Why not take a walk around town and pester someone else?

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.560
I'm busy.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.560
Okay, bye, mom.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.560
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.560
You know how he gets.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.560
Wait, we put the papers out for Jimmy?

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.560
Freshly baked cookies are in the trash can.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.560
Can I take a look at them?

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.560
Well, I guess I'll grab.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.560
Yeah, it's there.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.560
House indicator.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.560
I'm fine.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560
Harvest land, furniture, warehouse.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.560
Okay.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.560
The master bedroom door is firmly locked.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.560
Is that my father?

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.560
I could have taken a look at the baby.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.560
I can newborn baby is sleeping soundly.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560
He's eating.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.560
Now he doesn't sound healthy.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.560
Sounds like one of my, my senpai's dad.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.560
Oh boy.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.560
Now I'm squealing wickedly in the kitchen's antiseptic glow.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.560
Mom.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.560
I told you I'm busy, Steve.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.560
Why don't you talk to him?

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.560
I'm busy.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.560
I'm busy.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.560
I'm busy.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.560
I'm busy.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.560
I'm busy.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560
I'm busy.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560
I'm busy.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560
I'm busy.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.560
Steve, why don't you talk to Hank

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.560
or go next door and visit Stephanie

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.560
or go get an early start on your new job.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.560
Hank?

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.560
Hank.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560
That kid over by the television?

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.560
Your little brother is home sick from school today

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.560
and I won't have you scaring him with this amnesia poop.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.560
Is he really sick?

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.560
Look at the show he's watching.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.560
Wouldn't you say he's sick?

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.560
I'd make him stop, but oh, I'm so busy

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.560
baking cookies for the Harvest PPA charity bake sale.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.560
It's on Friday, you know.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.560
I hope you're still planning on going.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.560
I don't know.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.560
I need to think.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.560
Honestly, skipping out of a charity affair.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560
What's gotten into you?

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.560
I don't know.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.560
Damn it.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560
That's what I'm telling you.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.560
Don't you dare use that language around me.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.560
Oh, my goodness.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.560
Your father didn't hear you or Stephanie

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.560
for that matter.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.560
How do you think she'd feel knowing her fiance was a gutter mess?

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:21.560
Wait, did I talk about my father yet?

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.560
Didn't I foul a language?

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.560
Shit.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.560
Stop speaking nonsense, dear.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.560
Bitch.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:39.560
Stop speaking nonsense, dear.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560
Fuck.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.560
What a thing to say to your mother.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.560
Was that an invitation now that your father is out of action?

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:16.560
I'm flabbergasted.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.560
I'm flabbergasted.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.560
I guess we got to pick the first one.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.560
We got to pick the first one.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:30.560
I guess we have to pick the first one.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.560
I mean, everyone has as around the line, right?

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.560
Well, we're here.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.560
Let's go.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:47.560
Yeah, how about it, mommy?

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.560
Maybe later, dear.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.560
Right now I have housework to do.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.560
So you can watch if you want.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.560
Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.560
You know how he gets.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:17.560
My mouth is a gait.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:28.560
She said maybe later.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:37.560
We got a maybe?

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:42.560
There's a glow from behind the cabinet.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Can I punch my bro?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.560
What do I do if I say fuck to him?

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.560
No, nothing, OK.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.560
Bye.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.560
Why is there a glow there?

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.560
Can I?

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:09.560
Come on, walk.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.560
What's that glow?

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:19.560
Can I push it?

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.560
Remember to say before you do anything crazy,

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.560
I got the paper.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:32.560
Right here, I have the paper.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:42.560
What happened?

01:07:42.560 --> 01:08:01.560
What is this?

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.560
What a bag!

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.560
What a bag in the inventory!

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:17.560
Oh no, is this the paper?

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:23.560
What did I do, Aya?

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:38.560
Aya!

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.560
Tempai!

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.560
It's stuck!

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.560
It's stuck!

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.560
Can you hear that?

01:08:51.560 --> 01:09:01.560
It's making the t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t sound.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560
Now everything's frozen!

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.560
Aya!

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:14.560
Aya!

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:21.560
Aya, Tempai!

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.560
Don't look, Tempai!

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.560
Don't look at my...

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.560
No, that's not it.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:37.560
Don't look at my steam.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:49.560
Don't look at my steam.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:10:04.560
Oh now it decides to play in fullscreen stupid game.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.560
Never mind, I decided not to go in fullscreen anymore.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.560
Hello?

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:17.560
Hello?

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:23.560
Are you gonna...

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.560
Are you gonna show up?

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:37.560
Okay, there we go. We're fine now.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:48.560
Can I skip?

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:56.560
Wait, no, I have a save file. Load game.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:08.560
Or okay.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.560
Guess we should save more often.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:23.560
Okay, let's skip through this.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.560
Eddie.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:33.560
Girl.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560
Stephanie.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:39.560
Phoebe.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.560
There we go.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:50.560
I saved before the brother, which sucks.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:59.560
Cowboy.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:03.560
Oops.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.560
Bye.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.560
Bye.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.560
Guess we go talk to mom now.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:26.560
At least we can speedrun him being a brat, yeah.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:39.560
Talk to mom.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:44.560
Okay.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.560
Stephanie.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:51.560
Wedding.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.560
Beyonce.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.560
Cooking and cleaning.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.560
Father.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:12.560
Cookies.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.560
Uh, job. I remember it was job.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:26.560
I didn't actually talk about the job. What was my job?

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.560
Just like anybody else.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:44.560
Oh, my dad's work? Slaughterhouse.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:59.560
Mom, your voice changed.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:07.560
Uh, did we talk about lodge again?

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:16.560
Uh, why not? I go look into it.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.560
Harvest.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:27.560
Uh, I guess we can say, does anyone else know if we can say something else?

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:44.560
Cause, I don't know, I guess we can do this again.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:52.560
It still shocks me each time.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:15:02.560
Dirty diapers. Knives.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.560
Embroidery.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:10.560
Let's get out of here.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.560
Escape save game.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:20.560
Let's save it over this game file.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:31.560
Let's get box one newspapers. Let's grab the newspaper.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:41.560
I said grab the newspaper.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:56.560
I wonder if, if, if I need to, if I, if I can check it.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:02.560
Let's save again.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:10.560
Let's save again to see if that newspaper breaks again.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:18.560
Can I, how do I look at it? Does anyone remember how to look at it?

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:32.560
I guess it didn't break again.

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:39.560
Did I double click? I can't remember how to look at it. Right click to look at it.

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:46.560
Well, it's not, not doing anything.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:59.560
Now, whatever.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:04.560
This kid wants the paper, right?

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.560
Here you go.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:11.560
No.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.560
Hey Steve, you've been doing a swell drop putting the paper out in the morning.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:21.560
You just keep doing that and we won't have any problems. That's not much to ask, is it?

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.560
No.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.560
See you later alligator.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.560
Okay, see you later alligator.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:32.560
Full of junk, mail, bills and bake sale flyers.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:41.560
Is that? There are security bars fastened to the window with Phillip head screws.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:47.560
The day glow lima space disc stuck on the roof.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:53.560
An Army surplus air conditioner.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.560
Okay, this kid's acting a little hard for like, you know.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.560
See you later alligator.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:08.560
Okay, so I have to give him the paper every day.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:25.560
Can I see the paper?

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:30.560
Your house, general store or Stephanie's house?

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.560
Oh, huh?

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:41.560
Potsdam's residence.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.560
The garage needs some new paint job.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.560
Glass is so clear the reflection makes it difficult to see.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.560
Must have rained recently.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.560
That window is shaped like a wagon wheel.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:03.560
Hi.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:12.560
The man of the house squeezing his mate.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:18.560
Wait, I soft blocked myself. What do you mean?

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:22.560
There he is, my future son-in-law. And how's he doing today?

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.560
What brings him to the Potsdam household?

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:35.560
I came to see Stephanie.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.560
Oh, you'll have to ask the missus about that.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.560
Stephanie's grounded to the wedding.

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:57.560
Can't have her changing her mind at the last minute. Not with all that meat at stake.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.560
Me?

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:05.560
I haven't seen my father. He's locked in a room.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.560
He's not going to die, is he?

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:13.560
Like I said, I don't know. That woman, Mom, tends to him herself.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.560
Well, next time you see him, be sure to tell him that I said hello.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:21.560
And tell him that I'm praying for his speedy recovery.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:27.560
And also, would you remind him about the meat? Especially about the meat?

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.560
Yeah, fine. If I see him.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:36.560
You should be concerned. If he dies, then who's going to take over the slaughterhouse?

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.560
Who's going to tend to the meat?

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.560
Why is it meat?

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.560
You'd take over, right?

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560
Slaughterhouse?

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:54.560
I can't imagine a better job than working in a slaughterhouse.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.560
I think working in a slaughterhouse might be cool.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:04.560
Bite your tongue with that serpent's tooth. Your dead slaughterhouse is the most successful business in harvest.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.560
Oh, okay. Never mind. You got me angry at that.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.560
You'll love it there.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:13.560
Oh, sure. Cutting animals open may not be much fun. Reaching into their bodies...

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.560
Uh-huh.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.560
Oh, wait. Actually, this is fine.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:23.560
...testing, dangling, and slapping against you the smell of death and shit in your nostrils all the time.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.560
That's fine.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.560
Those are all definite cons of what you're done.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:33.560
The guts have been washed into the gutters. What have you left with them?

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.560
Meat.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.560
Rose and rose.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:43.560
Did the audio go weird?

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.560
Is that supposed to happen?

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.560
Was that supposed to happen?

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:16.560
That was a little bit spooky. That was kind of spooky. That surprised me when that happened.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.560
Yeah, let's talk more about the meat.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.560
Oh.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.560
I might have to turn the volume down if that happens again.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.560
Meat is the foundation of any decent society.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:38.560
Everyone needs at least five servings of red meat a day.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.560
And anyone who says otherwise is a commie.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.560
A commie?

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:47.560
And once you're married to Stephanie, I'll be part of the family, too.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.560
And your father will give me all the meat I want.

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.560
Time to make some for not getting into the lodge.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.560
It sounds so grainy.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.560
Is that supposed to happen?

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.560
Did I break the game?

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.560
Again?

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.560
Or is it just like that?

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.560
Yeah, let's talk about the meat.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:24.560
I don't like how he's talking about father's meat. Yeah, me neither.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:33.560
Meat is the foundation of any decent society. Everyone needs at least three servings of red meat a day.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:36.560
Alright, we already asked about that. Got it, father.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.560
I haven't seen my father.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.560
Like I said.

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.560
Well, next time you see him.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.560
Yeah, fuck.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.560
You should be more concerned.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.560
Um...

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.560
Bye?

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.560
Also, almost made of leather.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.560
It's polyester.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.560
The upholster you stained after years of profuse sweating.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:10.560
A futary urn in this cabinet so occupant.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:17.560
A giant mutant asparagus?

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:22.560
Inexplicably robust given the fact that it's encased in red concrete.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.560
Perhaps the health... healthful electromagnetic fields of harvest.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.560
Why is it sounding like this?

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.560
Hello, Steve. Have you lost a day?

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:45.560
You look just like my mom except for the hair.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.560
Honestly, you man can insult a woman without even knowing you've done it.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.560
What a horrible thing to say.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.560
Oh, you don't like my mom?

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.560
Same kind of dress. Same pearls.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.560
So bizarre.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.560
There's nothing bizarre about baking cookies.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.560
The harvest charity bake-so is Friday, you know, and by gosh,

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.560
Mrs. Marvin Potson Jr. can be counted on to do her share.

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.560
Pearls.

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.560
Just because I'm doing housework doesn't mean I have to be a drudge.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.560
It's a wife's duty to look good for her husband at all times.

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.560
What's wrong with wearing pearls for heaven's sake?

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.560
Nothing, but you look like June Cleaver.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.560
Some kind of sitcom, Mom.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.560
sitcom?

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.560
Geez, you know, a situation comedy.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.560
The weird part is, I can't remember how I know that.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.560
I'm much too busy with housework to watch TV.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:51.560
Maybe Mr. Potson would know about sitcoms.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.560
sitcoms?

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.560
Somebody doesn't watch TV though. She's grounded.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.560
Why is she grounded?

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.560
Mr. Potson feels there's too much at stake to allow Stephanie to run around with.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560
She doesn't want to get married either, huh?

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.560
Uh-huh.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.560
Are you saying you don't want to marry my daughter?

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.560
I don't know your daughter, Mrs. Potson.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.560
Why is she grounded?

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:14.560
Afraid she'll run away before the wedding?

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.560
No.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.560
She's as delighted as we are about the wedding.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.560
Every bit as delighted as we are.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:22.560
But she might be hit by a car or a fallen piano.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.560
Or who knows what?

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.560
A fallen piano?

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.560
Mr. Potson wants us all to be one happy family.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.560
And he doesn't want to risk anything happening at the last minute.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.560
You please let her out of her room, please.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:35.560
Not a chance, Steve.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.560
Mr. Potson wouldn't like it.

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.560
If you'd like to see her, it's fine with me.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.560
Go upstairs and turn right.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.560
Now, excuse me.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.560
I'm trying to get ready for the bake sale.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.560
Mr. Potson.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.560
You mustn't be too hard on Mr. Potson, Steve.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.560
He's a disappointed man.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.560
No matter how many large admission forms he fills out,

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.560
they keep turning him down.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.560
He has a new application in, though,

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.560
so keep your fingers crossed.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.560
If he joins the lodge,

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:09.560
you and Stephanie can have your wedding in the Chapel of Love

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.560
rather than over at Moynihan's place.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.560
Mr. what?

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.560
Moynihan?

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.560
Mr. Moynihan runs the Wayward Hotel

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.560
and the Shady Oaks Funeral Parlor.

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:23.560
It's rumored he has connections with the lodge,

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.560
but the order keeps that kind of thing safe.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.560
So Mr. Potson has tried to get him to put in a good word

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.560
for his lodge application?

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:34.560
But so far...

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.560
Lodge?

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.560
What can you tell me about the lodge?

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.560
Just that they're exclusive and secretive.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.560
If you're curious, you ought to pick up a lodge application

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.560
at the post office and take it over to the Sergeant at Arms.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.560
Isn't that a thought?

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.560
Isn't that a thought?

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.560
Forget Mr. Potson.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.560
If you became a member of the order,

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.560
we could hold the wedding inside the lodge.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:07.560
My, wouldn't that be lovely?

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.560
Okay.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.560
Tell me about this wedding.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560
Wedding?

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.560
Well, it's set for three weeks.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.560
We're holding it over at Shady Oaks,

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560
Mr. Moynihan's funeral parlor.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.560
Wedding in a funeral?

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.560
It's not a very romantic place,

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.560
but there's nowhere else to hold it.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.560
Thanks to Mr. Potson.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.560
You mustn't be too hard...

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:36.560
Give my regards to your parents.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.560
Wait, wait, what if I say those words?

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.560
Yes, please.

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.560
She's upstairs.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.560
What if I say fuck again?

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.560
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.560
Shit.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.560
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.560
Is that really, is that really,

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.560
is mom the only one that responds to that?

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.560
Icebox is locked.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.560
Our kitchen is a minty fresh looking scent.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.560
Pushes are preventing it from opening.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.560
A plastic plant with freshly watered soil,

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.560
and with little styrofoam balls.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.560
Our kitchen has a minty fresh look.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.560
Minty fresh look, minty fresh look.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.560
Okay, got it.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.560
Upstairs we go then.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.560
Duck.

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:38.560
A thin layer of hair coats

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.560
virtually every inch of ceramic.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.560
Our duck has seen better days.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.560
He's purty.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.560
This window affords a spectacular view of aluminum siding.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.560
A picture on the wall is hanging a bit crooked.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.560
Ah!

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:17.560
Medicine cabinet reeks of various toiletries.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.560
Can I grab tampons?

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.560
Better ask Stephanie about those.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.560
You're here to roll the tube from the bottom.

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:31.560
New zippy vitamins will pick you right up.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.560
Got a headache?

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.560
This aspirin should do the trick.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.560
You are of extra strength or a lube.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.560
Great for getting in and out of tight spots.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.560
Give me that.

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.560
One hour cough medicine.

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.560
Give me that.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.560
Morning yeast disinfectant.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.560
Not to be used for baking cookies.

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:52.560
Give me that.

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.560
Give me that too.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.560
And those.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.560
Thanks.

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:02.560
Plants.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:10.560
Fully yoded.

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.560
I don't look around the room, sorry.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.560
Yes, nice taste.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.560
That's it?

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:23.560
I guess I can talk to her?

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.560
Who are you?

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.560
What are you doing in my room?

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.560
Haven't you heard?

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.560
We're getting married.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.560
So, you're the one.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.560
Steve, isn't it?

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.560
You mean, you don't know me?

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.560
You don't know me?

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.560
You don't know me?

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.560
Yeah, what's going on?

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.560
Those people?

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.560
This actress and her VA are the same person.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.560
Oh, okay.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.560
Steve has a different one for some reason.

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.560
Maybe his voice wasn't Steve enough.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.560
Alright, let's talk about those people.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.560
I know what you mean, I don't belong here.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.560
Dang it.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.560
Okay, fair.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.560
Yeah, I get it.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.560
Yeah, I understand.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.560
Both grounded.

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.560
Okay, grounded.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.560
Have you seen or heard anything?

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.560
Have you seen or heard anything?

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.560
Anything else?

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.560
Anything else?

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.560
Huh?

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.560
Did dad put that people in then?

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.560
Mr. Potsdam?

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.560
Escape.

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.560
I think you're right.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:38.560
Harvest blood drive, huh?

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.560
Alright, alright.

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.560
Amnesia.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.560
Oh, does that mean bombs?

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.560
I have had these recurring dreams.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.560
Just fragments, really.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.560
Strange, abstract images.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.560
Liquid, chrome.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.560
Chrome?

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.560
Probably just a dream.

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.560
Well, have you thought about how to escape harvest?

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.560
Well, what's escape?

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.560
Harvest is a pri-

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.560
You're too eccentric.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.560
You haven't been locked in your room for a week.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.560
Okay, can I say fuck to her?

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.560
You're not making sense.

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:41.560
Never mind.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.560
Duty?

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:44.560
Duty?

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.560
You're not making sense.

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.560
Okay, bye.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.560
Come back and visit me soon, okay?

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.560
Okay.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.560
Damn, it must be boring.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.560
That rope looks about red meat

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.560
and its importance to living well.

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.560
These books are obviously fakes.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:10.560
Makeup looks just fine.

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:13.560
A closet door won't budge.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.560
Okay, well.

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.560
Here we go.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.560
Only with the mom is wild.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:25.560
Why is it only with the mommy?

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.560
Peep.

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.560
No.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.560
Peep.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.560
Bathroom?

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:42.560
Oh.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:46.560
Ah!

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.560
Two!

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.560
Two!

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.560
Three!

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.560
Should I try all of them?

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.560
Everyone's saying two.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.560
Okay, let's do two.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.560
Obviously Mrs. Pops to Mrs. B.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.560
Ruin his marriage?

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.560
Kohai, did you save?

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.560
I didn't save.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:35.560
When was the last time I saved before I brought the paper out?

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.560
Okay, let's do two.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.560
Ah!

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.560
Mrs. Potsdam has a little problem.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.560
I'll handle it myself.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.560
Thanks for calling this to my attention, Steve.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.560
Then you won't mind if I tell Stephanie about it?

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:08.560
Now, there's no need to scare Stephanie with this business.

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.560
I guess not.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.560
So long as you patch that hole.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.560
Well, I guess I could hang that picture somewhere else.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.560
I thought you had no idea where it was.

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.560
Hall?

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560
Beg pardon?

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560
Hall?

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.560
Even...

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.560
Looks like the house's previous owner was a pervert!

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.560
I thought you had no idea where it was.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.560
Hall?

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560
Beg pardon?

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.560
You've got a peephole in the upstairs bathroom.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.560
It looks in on Stephanie's room.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.560
Well, I'll be darned.

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:10.560
You've been spying on your daughter, haven't you?

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.560
How dare you!

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.560
I'm no peeping Tom.

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.560
I had no idea that was there.

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560
Then you won't mind if I tell Stephanie about it?

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.560
Now, there's no need to scare Stephanie with this business.

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.560
I guess not.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.560
So long as you patch that hole.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.560
Well, I guess I could hang that picture somewhere else.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.560
I thought you had no idea where it was.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.560
We're telling Stephanie.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.560
Maybe I'll save.

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.560
I'll save, but I'm telling Stephanie.

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:54.560
I'm telling her!

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:10.560
Okay, cool, but, uh, hole.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.560
They're spying on me?

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:26.560
I'm afraid so.

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.560
So, that's the scraping I hear every night.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.560
The picture sliding along the wall.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.560
Disgusting.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.560
I've got to get out of here, Steve.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:40.560
The thought of that fat slob.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.560
Watching me.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.560
I confronted Pott's stem about it.

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.560
He tried to play dumb, but I got him to say he'd fix it.

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.560
Thank you, Steve.

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.560
I don't know what I'd do without you.

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:55.560
Come back and visit me soon, okay?

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.560
Make this save in slot two, okay?

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.560
Sam pie.

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.560
Hmm? Huh?

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.560
You go ahead and fix that, right, Sam pie?

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.560
You go ahead and fix that, right, Sam pie?

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.560
Hmm.

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:11.560
I played the fifth, but I see Azra's in yours.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.560
Why is mine not there too, Sam pie?

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.560
Hmm?

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.560
Mm-hmm.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.560
Yeah, I'm sure I'll hear the excuses.

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:50.560
But it'll be the last excuse you ever make.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.560
Okay, Sam pie?

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.560
It's a glitch and I can't see it.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.560
You think I'm blind, Sam pie?

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:05.560
You think I'm blind, Sam pie?

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.560
You think I can't fucking see?

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.560
It's because I have an eye patch.

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.560
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.560
I can take it off right now and I can see perfectly fine.

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:22.560
Sam pie?

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:34.560
Huh?

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.560
Please be lenient.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:48.560
I expect to see at least a broken heart if you're not allowed to put in scissors.

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.560
Or maybe another heart.

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.560
A full heart because that's what you're going to do, Sam pie,

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:57.560
is that you're going to put my broken heart together

01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.560
and you're going to love me forever, right?

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:06.560
Why would I wear one eye patch if I have two eyes?

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.560
You didn't watch my debut?

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.560
Sam pie?

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.560
You didn't watch my debut?

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:23.560
You should know if you watched my debut.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.560
Uh huh, uh huh.

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:40.560
Well, Sam pie.

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.560
I'm sure two of you can fit into one barrel, right?

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:55.560
I'm sure two of you can fit into one barrel.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.560
If you don't, a bone saw will come in handy.

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.560
Oh, you have amnesia.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:18.560
Do you just like Steve and Stephanie?

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.560
But we're not in harvest here.

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:29.560
We're not in harvest here, Sam pie.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:38.560
We are in harvest in the game, but you're in my basement.

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.560
That's not harvest.

01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:47.560
Do you really love me, Sam pie?

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.560
Say it.

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.560
Say that you love me.

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.560
Sam pie.

01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.560
Say that you love me.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:01.560
Right now.

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:04.560
Say it.

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.560
Say it!

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:14.560
Hmm.

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560
Uh huh, uh huh.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.560
I didn't see all of you say you love me.

01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:48.560
Did you lie?

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.560
Did you lie to me, Sam pie?

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.560
Is that what you're saying?

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:58.560
You're lying to me?

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:04.560
Of course.

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.560
No lies, right?

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.560
You don't love me.

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.560
Right?

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.560
I love you, Sam pie.

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:18.560
So make sure you don't make me mad again.

01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:26.560
Understood.

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.560
Well, let's see what's going on here.

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.560
Tave game.

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.560
That...

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.560
The attic window is the perfect nesting ground for wasps.

01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.560
I don't like wasps.

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:02.560
Oh wait, I can go in?

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:05.560
Oh wait, I can go in?

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.560
These are all freaking wasps?

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.560
The icebox is sealed shut.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.560
Shut with a wasp, man.

01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.560
The wasp woman.

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:36.560
The Judeo-Christian rights of sacrifice

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:40.560
and conventional taboos against unbridled pleasure

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:44.560
for the prejudice against wasps.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.560
Do wasps make...

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.560
Do wasps make honey?

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.560
Do wasps make honey?

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.560
I don't think wasps make honey.

01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.560
Okay.

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.560
Honey?

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:14.560
Okay, selling versus...

01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:32.560
It's not what is produced.

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:36.560
So much as what is performed.

01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:39.560
I don't see any particular use for wasps.

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:43.560
Why must everything have a use?

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:48.560
Is there always the determining factor?

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:53.560
More slender, more aerodynamic than the bee.

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.560
The wasp is a joy to behold.

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:01.560
Why is the wasp having the harvest logo?

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.560
Ju-juicy?

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.560
Ju-juicy?

01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:17.560
Juicy?

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:25.560
Wasps?

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:30.560
Wasps produce nothing for others,

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.560
but only for themselves.

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:37.560
Wasps spill nests and more wasps, nothing more.

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:41.560
They spread into eons and addicts,

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:44.560
not to make honey for supermarkets,

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:48.560
but to buzz and rustle on their own paper,

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.560
perpetuating their own agenda,

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:54.560
growing stealthily,

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:58.560
the most relentless of insects.

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:03.560
Aren't those wasps also help pollinate things

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:07.560
as of, like, even by accident?

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:13.560
What are the drawbacks of wasps, ma'am?

01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:17.560
Well, as you can see,

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:21.560
the little darlings do love to sting.

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:25.560
Another source of prejudice for the masses,

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.560
and another reason to love them.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:31.560
Bees are like animals,

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:34.560
they sting only for a reason,

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.560
for sacrifice.

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:40.560
They have no conception of individual sensation

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:43.560
of pleasure.

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:47.560
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, pleasure?

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.560
Yes.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:53.560
A great deal of pleasure.

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.560
The wasp is an individual being,

01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:58.560
not a laborer,

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:01.560
hedonistic instead of industrial.

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.560
Someone needs to anger.

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:08.560
In truth, they are easily swayed to ecstasy.

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:11.560
They penetrate your throats,

01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:14.560
and the muscular contractions in their thorax,

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.560
as they pump venom,

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:19.560
could be likened to the muscular contractions

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:22.560
of ejaculation,

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:25.560
each painful welt,

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:28.560
an act of love.

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:32.560
I don't think that was for pleasure.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:35.560
I don't think that was for pleasure, just said.

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.560
Sacrifice?

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.560
It's audacity.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:49.560
This appeals to those raised worshipping of God,

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:54.560
that demand sacrifice and atonement.

01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:57.560
But the wasp is promiscuous.

01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.560
Promiscuous?

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:02.560
They are not as sympathetic to the masses,

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:06.560
because they do die when they sting.

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:10.560
They live to sting another day,

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:13.560
and they take pleasure from it.

01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:19.560
They do?

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:22.560
I don't know anything about,

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:25.560
I don't know anything about wasp,

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:28.560
to interject with this.

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:29.560
Juicy?

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.560
What did you mean by juicy?

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.560
A triviality.

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.560
Look.

01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:38.560
A triviality.

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:43.560
Sting? Sting?

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.560
A triviality.

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.560
Um...

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.560
Wasp girl?

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:53.560
Stop talking about gen 2.

01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:58.560
But maybe I'll pass that idea on to mummy.

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:00.560
Maybe.

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.560
I guess wasp is...

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:06.560
Okay, I guess all of you guys are turned on by wasp now.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.560
I guess senpais really love wasp now, right?

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:14.560
That means senpais want me to trap them

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:17.560
in a shed full of wasp, right?

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.560
Please, no.

01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.560
I'll let them loose in the basement.

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.560
Yeah, maybe I'll just stuff out of the basement,

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.560
and I'll let them all loose.

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.560
I'll collect all of them.

01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.560
If that's what you want.

01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.560
Wasp outfit?

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.560
What?

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:54.560
You want me to be like,

01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.560
I'm a sexy wasp.

01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.560
I'm a sexy wasp.

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.560
Sexy wasp.

01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.560
So silly.

01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.560
Anything else?

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.560
Yes.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.560
A great deal of each.

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.560
Do you like bees?

01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.560
A triviality.

01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:31.560
Hive?

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.560
A triviality.

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.560
Fridge?

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.560
Okay, maybe I'll do fridge.

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.560
Fridge.

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.560
Fridge.

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:46.560
Fridge.

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.560
A triviality.

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.560
Um, lodge?

01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.560
Can I do the lodge?

01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.560
A triviality.

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:56.560
Harvest?

01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.560
A triviality.

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.560
Queen?

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.560
A triviality.

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.560
Try triviality?

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:14.560
Triv.

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.560
How do I spell triviality?

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.560
Triv...

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.560
Triviality.

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.560
A triviality.

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:28.560
She focuses on wasps only.

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.560
Pollination.

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.560
Pollination.

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.560
A triviality.

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.560
Wasp.

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:42.560
A triviality.

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:44.560
Wow, okay, never mind then, I guess. Bye!

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.560
Anything else I can grab in here?

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:50.560
From the sound of it, these cabinets are infested with wasps.

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.560
A rather colorful picture

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.560
of a wasp.

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:02.560
A wasp nest.

01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:04.560
Okay.

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:10.560
An old car is the perfect nesting ground

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.560
for a wasp.

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.560
Okay.

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.560
A general store?

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.560
What's this?

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:24.560
Tapes and broken glass.

01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:26.560
Obviously a professional break-in.

01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.560
He's too busy working to notice you.

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:32.560
Air-conditioned!

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.560
Yum-creamed asparagus.

01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:40.560
Two for forty-nine.

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:42.560
Zero forty-nine.

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.560
Yum-creamed asparagus.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.560
No?

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.560
Harvest bake sale this Friday

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:50.560
in the school gym.

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.560
What's this?

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.560
Free copies made here.

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.560
Okay.

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:08.560
To add roaches and bits of

02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:10.560
agrid grit,

02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.560
coat the water coolers bone-dry

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:14.560
reservoir.

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:16.560
This empty barrel reeks

02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:18.560
of rotting meat.

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:24.560
Who are you?

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:28.560
Helps?

02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:40.560
Everybody says I'm a kidder.

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.560
What do you mean, willies?

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.560
Speak your woolly!

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.560
Uh, yeah, please.

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:18.560
Oh, what?

02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:26.560
Chef contains an odd

02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.560
item for sale.

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:40.560
Orange?

02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:44.560
Tape?

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.560
Wait, sorry.

02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:48.560
What was that?

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.560
An adult magazine for twenty-five cents.

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:52.560
You must pay Mrs. Phelps

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:54.560
before you buy anything.

02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.560
A slightly used wrench.

02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:00.560
You must pay Mrs. Phelps

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:02.560
before you buy anything.

02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:06.560
A cow is bleeding

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:08.560
a robust coffee

02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:10.560
on these harvest blend coffee can labels.

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:12.560
Cans of soup!

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:14.560
Or possibly rat poison.

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.560
Black electrical tape.

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.560
You must pay Mrs. Phelps before you can buy anything.

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.560
I don't have any money

02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:28.560
except to buy the Dirty magazine.

02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:30.560
Should I buy the

02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.560
the Dirty magazine

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:34.560
zine senpai?

02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.560
I'm gonna use a wrench and tape for mercy.

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:40.560
I have lots of those.

02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:42.560
Yes.

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.560
Yeah, let's have, yeah, let's pay for it!

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:48.560
Where's my items?

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:50.560
There we go.

02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:54.560
My quarter.

02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.560
Here you go.

02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:58.560
Only thing a quarter will buy is an adult magazine.

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:02.560
A girly magazine?

02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.560
Yeah!

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:12.560
I've been in here ogling the girly magazines

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:14.560
behind my counter.

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.560
Darned if I'd sell him one though.

02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:18.560
I know his wife for heaven's sakes.

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:20.560
Well, will you sell me one?

02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.560
I certainly will Steve.

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.560
That kind of interest is healthy

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:26.560
for a young fellow.

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:28.560
Stares him away from being a

02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:30.560
fireman.

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:32.560
What's wrong with the fireman?

02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:36.560
So am I getting it?

02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:38.560
I got it!

02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:40.560
Wait, let's save before we look at it.

02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.560
Let's save before we look at it,

02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:46.560
because I feel like if I don't say

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:48.560
it's gonna do that weird thing again.

02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:58.560
Let me look at it!

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:00.560
Can I look at it?

02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.560
Why? Why can't I look at it?

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.560
I got it!

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.560
I wanted to look at the girly magazine!

02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:22.560
I wanted to see the dirty magazines.

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:24.560
The dirty magazines.

02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:40.560
I wanted to look at the dirty magazines.

02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:42.560
You're not allowed to look at the dirty

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.560
You're not allowed to look at the dirty magazines.

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:48.560
Senpai.

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:50.560
But you can with me.

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.560
We're just gonna have to imagine it.

02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:56.560
I can't even look at the paper.

02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.560
You're gonna read a dirty mag on stream?

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.560
It's not, it's not bad

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.560
if it's a part of a game.

02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.560
What about dirty magazines of you?

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:14.560
Of me?

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:16.560
I don't think there's any.

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:18.560
But wouldn't that make you jealous, Senpai?

02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:24.560
I don't know.

02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:32.560
Although I didn't want to see it

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:34.560
because I was like, oh what's in

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.560
what's in the dirty magazine?

02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:40.560
Okay, well...

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.560
Post office?

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:48.560
When do they have signs?

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:50.560
What's this, a crushed paper cup

02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:52.560
that you can't see?

02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.560
Blind woman's trying to read her mail.

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:04.560
Mailboxes seem hardly

02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.560
hardly used.

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:08.560
Yes?

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.560
I need some help.

02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:12.560
Mr. Postmaster Boyle.

02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:14.560
What can I do for you today?

02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:16.560
Boyle?

02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:18.560
I'd like a lodge application.

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:22.560
I'm sorry, youngster.

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:24.560
We're out of applications right now.

02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:26.560
Come on.

02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:28.560
You must have one around here somewhere.

02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:30.560
Well, I do have the master,

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:32.560
but you can't write on that.

02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:34.560
And I only make copies once a month

02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:36.560
on the button, regular as clockwork.

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:42.560
Can I go...

02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.560
get one at the lodge instead?

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:46.560
Afraid not, son.

02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:48.560
You can't get them anywhere but the post office.

02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:50.560
I'm sorry, you'll just have to come back in a month.

02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.560
Same as anyone else.

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:54.560
And even then, I can't guarantee you'll get an application.

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:56.560
The line is always long

02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:58.560
and they're never enough to go around.

02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:00.560
It's very important that I get in quickly.

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:02.560
That's what they all say.

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:04.560
Postmaster Boyle, I'll just die

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:06.560
if I don't get into the lodge.

02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.560
Can't make an exception, young man.

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:10.560
Just wouldn't be right.

02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:14.560
What?

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.560
What's the zip code?

02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:18.560
Oh, zip code,

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:20.560
map with the harvest dead center.

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:26.560
I wonder if I can distract him three clocks

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:28.560
three times.

02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:32.560
I wonder if I can distract him.

02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:38.560
Maybe give Fat Meatman

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:40.560
the dirty magazine

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:42.560
to get an application.

02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:44.560
He said something about the sheriff.

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.560
So the hint was that the sheriff probably

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:48.560
gets the magazine.

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:54.560
That's what it said before.

02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.560
So I played enough

02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:58.560
pointing clicks to know

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:00.560
that perhaps that is the reason.

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:02.560
Maybe I can go to the barbershop?

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:14.560
I always feel like

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.560
before I need to go into a building

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.560
I need to save.

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.560
Maybe you can trade the magazine

02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:26.560
with the blind woman paper.

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:28.560
Enough about the magazine.

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.560
It's going to the chief sheriff.

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:38.560
A fancy barber pole

02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:40.560
secured to the wall with straight

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.560
shot screws.

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.560
Why is there an alien up there?

02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:46.560
An unfortunate extraterrestrial

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:48.560
who journeyed hundreds of lights years

02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:50.560
to wind up mounted to a barber's wall.

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:54.560
Except for his occasional hairball cough

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:56.560
it's hard to tell if the sheep is alive or not.

02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:00.560
Made of solidified moose

02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:02.560
and sticky hairspray.

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:04.560
This lovely mannequin is a work of art.

02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:08.560
It takes a true sportsman to hunt down those dangerous

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:10.560
dogs.

02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:12.560
A dangling television is sure to cause

02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:14.560
neck strain at this angle.

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.560
Call

02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:22.560
call, call a note, call a note, Buster Monroe

02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:24.560
Colonel

02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:26.560
Colonel Colonel Colonel

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:28.560
There you go.

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:30.560
Colonel Buster Monroe flipping

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:32.560
the bird from his B-17

02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:34.560
cockpit.

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:36.560
That's a picture of Mr. Pastrilli

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:38.560
as a young buck.

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:43.560
Picture of a young Mr. Pastrilli spaghetti in his mouth and awe.

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:45.560
Howdy Steve.

02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:48.560
Yeah. Howdy back, Mr.

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:50.560
It swells, Steve.

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.560
Don't disturb my old leg now.

02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:55.560
Change your mind about that aluminum siding.

02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:56.560
What are you talking about?

02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.560
What are you talking about?

02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:00.560
I really think you should tuck your father into buying some.

02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:02.560
He can afford it.

02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:07.560
And I can't stress enough the value of some really fine aluminum siding.

02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:13.560
Keeps it warm in the summer, cool in the winter, and it keeps out the shade.

02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:15.560
Warm out in the summer and cool in the winter, huh?

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:16.560
No, thank you.

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:21.560
But I can't get him to understand a word I say.

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:22.560
Aluminum siding.

02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:23.560
I didn't mean to click him.

02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:30.560
I meant to like click something else, but okay.

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.560
Aluminum siding.

02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:37.560
Steve, aluminum siding can't get a fair shake no more.

02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:47.560
Started when those firemen came to harvest, filling people's heads with new fangled notions like color coordination and interior design.

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.560
You can paint aluminum, you know, if you want to.

02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:55.560
But even so, I can't seem to move it anymore.

02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:59.560
Not even to a rouble like Pastrilli.

02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:04.560
Thank God for the plumbing.

02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:18.560
Are we implying that the firemen are a little...

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:20.560
It's okay.

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:22.560
I'll relate with the firemen.

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:25.560
I love interior design and color coordination.

02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:29.560
After all, every time we go on dates, we have to be color coordinated.

02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:40.560
So everybody knows that we're a couple.

02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.560
We'll get along just fine.

02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:47.560
Maybe they can give some tips on more interior design.

02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:57.560
Maybe I can make the basement more welcoming for my supplies.

02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:59.560
Don't you think that'll be great?

02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:05.560
Maybe we can wear those like t-shirts that's like...

02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:11.560
That's like, I'm his and I'm hers.

02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.560
The matching collar was enough?

02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:16.560
No, we have to have like matching everything.

02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:19.560
That'd be cute.

02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:31.560
And matching and like promise rings.

02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:42.560
Oh, well, let's talk more about Pastrilli.

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:45.560
Pastrilli's a rouble from way back.

02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:50.560
Ask Clam Parsons how we followed up with the alarm system in here.

02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:51.560
I'm a plumber.

02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:55.560
I could fix it for him, but he just won't listen.

02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.560
I mean...

02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:02.560
Well, I've seen the end coming for the aluminum siding game,

02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:05.560
so I took a mail course and learned how to be a plumber.

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.560
Now, there's a business that never lets up.

02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:12.560
You'd be surprised when people flush down the toilet.

02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:13.560
You know, fair.

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:15.560
I always need...

02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:18.560
Sometimes I had to call a plumber,

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:21.560
but then three plumbers ghosted me.

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:27.560
And then Papa Mercy came to save the day and fixed it.

02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:30.560
We fixed it itself.

02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:32.560
We fixed it ourselves.

02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:36.560
I can't believe plumbers nowadays would just ghost you like that.

02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:40.560
Don't they want money?

02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:47.560
Don't they want money?

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:49.560
I don't get it.

02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:51.560
I was willing to pay.

02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.560
But they always ghost.

02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:56.560
And I'm just like, why?

02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:05.560
So Papa was so sick of it, he just fixed it himself.

02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:07.560
Didn't you scare them away? Why would I?

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.560
All I said was my shower stopped working.

02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:14.560
This is called Papa Modisse first time?

02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:20.560
Well, it was Papa Modisse idea to call the plumber first.

02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:24.560
And then once the first one...

02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:30.560
Once the first one ghosted,

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:33.560
we're like, okay, maybe that one's just busy.

02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:35.560
We called a different one. We called another one.

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:38.560
And then that didn't work.

02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:40.560
And so we called another one.

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.560
And that didn't work.

02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:45.560
And like, well, the last one we called,

02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:48.560
we waited for like, odd day for him.

02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:50.560
And he was a no-show.

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:52.560
He was a no-show.

02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:55.560
And then we called the place back and they were like,

02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:57.560
oh yeah, tomorrow.

02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.560
And so we waited another day and he never showed.

02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.560
And we called back and they were like,

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:05.560
oh yeah, yeah, maybe another day.

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.560
And then we're like, you know what?

02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.560
Can we cancel that?

02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:18.560
And so after that, Papa was like,

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:21.560
screw this, I'll do it myself.

02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:28.560
And then, and then...

02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:35.560
And then he did it himself and he did a great job.

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:48.560
Gave you the window and then no-show?

02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:50.560
Yeah, like twice.

02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:52.560
All of them did.

02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:55.560
I just don't understand plumbers.

02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.560
Bye-bye.

02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:00.560
Nice to see you again, Steve.

02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:05.560
Mr. Pastrilli does not respond, not understanding English.

02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:07.560
Wait, what?

02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:09.560
Is he Italian?

02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:11.560
Mamma mia!

02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:15.560
Hello there, youngster.

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:18.560
They say them aliens I was telling you about,

02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:20.560
they came back last night,

02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:23.560
cut another crop circle in the Southfield.

02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:26.560
How come I never see none of them saw some plum?

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:28.560
Them aliens is wild, they think.

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:31.560
You don't cross the intergalactic void

02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:33.560
without learning a trick or two.

02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:35.560
You know what Mr. Pastrilli did?

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:38.560
Yesterday, he gets an alarm system to protect his pole.

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:43.560
Only he don't know how to rig it, so now it's all arrived.

02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:45.560
Hmm.

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:47.560
Yeah.

02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:53.560
Sometimes it's a job for YouTube tutorials

02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:55.560
and multiple chips to the hardware store.

02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:57.560
Actually, that's exactly what Papa did,

02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:59.560
except for he didn't really...

02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:01.560
He doesn't know YouTube.

02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:03.560
Speaking of YouTube,

02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:06.560
guess what, Senpai, you all have been...

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:11.560
You all have been, um...

02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:15.560
promoted from students to fans.

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:19.560
Mama Mercy has figured out what a YouTuber is.

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:22.560
We're making progress!

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:25.560
Except for now, she's been trying to convince me

02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:28.560
to do tours of the local Costco.

02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:32.560
A film tour of the local Costco.

02:17:41.560 --> 02:18:01.560
She's apparently been watching people do show off

02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:06.560
what's being bought at, like, what's new products from Costco.

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:10.560
And so she's like, that seems really easy, dear.

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:14.560
Except for now, we have another problem.

02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:18.560
We have another problem.

02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:22.560
Senpai, we have another problem.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:27.560
She's now wanting the play button faster.

02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.560
She wants it faster.

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:33.560
She's like, yeah, you can get it now, right?

02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:36.560
I'm sure lots of people will watch.

02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:41.560
And now I'm worried.

02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:44.560
You think she's gonna find you at any point?

02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:46.560
Probably not.

02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:55.560
She watches cooking videos in Vietnamese.

02:18:55.560 --> 02:19:01.560
She's watching cooking videos and Costco tours,

02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:08.560
or store tours, I guess, tours of shops and stuff.

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:10.560
She's getting it!

02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:16.560
Not all of it, but she's getting it.

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:19.560
When do we get a cooking stream with Kohai?

02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:23.560
To be honest, I'm a little clumsy.

02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:26.560
Mama, last time I tried to go in the kitchen,

02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:33.560
Mama said, get out.

02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:36.560
Don't worry, I'll try my best for you, Senpai.

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:41.560
But last time she said...

02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:45.560
She said, uh...

02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:55.560
I'm too clumsy to be in the kitchen.

02:19:55.560 --> 02:20:02.560
Yeah!

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:05.560
I mean, I don't blame her.

02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:10.560
You want to hear a funny story?

02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:17.560
So I was trying to cut strawberries with a fruit knife.

02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:21.560
And if you didn't know,

02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:27.560
fruit knives, the sharp part is not the curved part.

02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:32.560
The sharp part is the flat side.

02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:38.560
You can see where I'm getting at, right?

02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:40.560
So I was cutting strawberries,

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:43.560
and I was having trouble cutting the strawberries.

02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:47.560
And Mama looked at me and said,

02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:50.560
it's upside down.

02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:56.560
And you know what I did?

02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:01.560
I flipped the strawberry and not the knife,

02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:11.560
and continued trying to cut it.

02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:36.560
I got it in the end when she grabbed the knife

02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:44.560
and put it down to the flat side instead.

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:49.560
Well, I'm not used to fruit knives, you know?

02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:56.560
So I just assumed the sharp side was the curved side.

02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:58.560
How did you survive this long?

02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:03.560
I have no idea, to be honest.

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:05.560
Like knife, you know?

02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:08.560
You're used to the curved side being the sharp part,

02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:10.560
but on a fruit knife it's not that part.

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:20.560
But the flat end.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:26.560
So, which is why I was very confused.

02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:30.560
I was confused.

02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:32.560
And the bright side, we might get hurt less.

02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:37.560
What do you mean?

02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:41.560
What do you mean some pie?

02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:43.560
You should have just used scissors.

02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:47.560
But it was a really cute fruit knife.

02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:50.560
It was like, it was a cute color.

02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:52.560
It was like this kind of like reddish,

02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.560
orange fruit knife.

02:22:54.560 --> 02:23:04.560
I got it at Ikea.

02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:07.560
With scissors it's really easy to remember the sharp side, right?

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:09.560
Yeah, of course.

02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:14.560
It's easy.

02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:30.560
But I was unfamiliar with fruit knives game.

02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:32.560
I can make cakes and stuff too,

02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:38.560
but sometimes I spill a little bit of the flour,

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:41.560
or I accidentally put too much butter in.

02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:44.560
Actually, the last time I made cookies,

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:46.560
actually not the first time I made cookies.

02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:48.560
I wasn't cookies.

02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:51.560
Sorry, it was bread.

02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:53.560
First time I tried making bread.

02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:58.560
So, first time I tried making bread,

02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:09.560
I misread the...

02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:12.560
I didn't realize there was a difference

02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:19.560
between tablespoon and teaspoon.

02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:33.560
So, when I asked for 3 teaspoons of salt,

02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:37.560
I put in 3 tablespoons of salt.

02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:40.560
And let me just say, not even the birds wanted it.

02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:56.560
It's okay, I'll get better for you, Senpai.

02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:09.560
I'll be a good wife, I promise.

02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:12.560
I think mom was right, maybe just a little bit.

02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:15.560
Well, she does have those memories fresh in her mind,

02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:16.560
so that's why she's like,

02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:18.560
if I go into the kitchen and I'm like,

02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:19.560
I want to make this, she's like,

02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:25.560
stop, I'll make it for you.

02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:36.560
What do you mean you don't want to marry me?

02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:44.560
What do you mean you don't want to marry me, Senpai?

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:52.560
Mazodia obliterate!

02:25:52.560 --> 02:26:01.560
That was mean Senpai, you shouldn't say things like that.

02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:13.560
He shouldn't say things like that.

02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:19.560
I'm trying my best to be a good wife.

02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:26.560
Anyways, let's continue.

02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:28.560
Paul, what do you mean the Paul?

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:31.560
What Barber fully is, is his pride and joy.

02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:33.560
Brought it all the way over from Italy.

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:35.560
Wrapped off special-like.

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.560
Wrapped off special-like?

02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.560
It ain't no but colored glass,

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:40.560
with some bulbs just stuck up in it.

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:43.560
He thinks it's to be all in, doll.

02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:46.560
Install that alarm system just to protect it.

02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:48.560
Though who in Tarnation

02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:50.560
would want to steal a worthless piece of junk like that?

02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:51.560
I don't know.

02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:53.560
Maybe them aliens, Clem.

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:54.560
Oh, the aliens?

02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:56.560
Oh, Pete, don't be ignorant.

02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:00.560
Aliens don't give a fig for no colored glass.

02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:02.560
You think if they can build spaceships,

02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:04.560
they can't make a bad-gum barber pole?

02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:05.560
Well, maybe.

02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:18.560
They don't know nothing about science.

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.560
Can we get a pole in the basement?

02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:22.560
It'll be nice to watch when Kauai is in here.

02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:25.560
But Senpai,

02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:28.560
give you the television on all the time,

02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:31.560
with all of my VHSs.

02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:34.560
You can watch anything you want.

02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:45.560
I highly recommend the Digimon the first movie.

02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:46.560
We get a TV.

02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:49.560
Yeah, very small one.

02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:53.560
Everyone gets to watch it.

02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:59.560
Can I watch Berserk?

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.560
Only the first one, okay?

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:02.560
Any following...

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:03.560
Any...

02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:04.560
And definitely not the 3D one,

02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:11.560
or the following ones, okay?

02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:15.560
No!

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:22.560
Excuse me.

02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:26.560
Pastirelli shelled out for an alarm system all right,

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:29.560
but he's too cheap to hire an electrician to hook her up.

02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:32.560
Dang, Egypt cross-wired it through the fire sprinkler.

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:34.560
So now when the alarm goes off,

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:36.560
it sets the sprinkler spraying.

02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:37.560
Coronation.

02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:39.560
Aliens looking for intelligent life

02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:43.560
ought to stay away from this shop, sure enough.

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:44.560
Hmm.

02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:51.560
Is that the hint for the firefighters, perhaps?

02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:56.560
Wait, do you actually like Digimon,

02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:59.560
or was that a meme?

02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:01.560
Every birthday senpai.

02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:05.560
I rewatched the Digimon movie.

02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:15.560
On the VHS it has the Angela Anaconda shorts in front of it.

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:24.560
Hmm, that one.

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:33.560
I watch the one that has like 3 movies attached into it.

02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:36.560
I watch it for my birthday all the time.

02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:37.560
Every year.

02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:48.560
It's like tradition now.

02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:52.560
And then, I don't know if all versions have this one,

02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:56.560
but at the end they have kids of America music video,

02:29:56.560 --> 02:30:10.560
like a flash music video.

02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:12.560
Are you gonna watch it together?

02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:15.560
I only have it on VHS, so I don't know.

02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:17.560
I don't know if I...

02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:25.560
I don't know how to share VHS.

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:27.560
Hmm, that's the one I have.

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:33.560
I also have like a variety of Pokemon movies too.

02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:36.560
My first gift from Mama...

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:39.560
Well, first gift that I can remember from Mama and Papa

02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:52.560
was Pokemon the first movie.

02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:54.560
Well, let's talk about aliens.

02:30:54.560 --> 02:31:00.560
Well, son, the ways of the alien is a specialized area of woodcraft,

02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:04.560
the known to all but the wily of sportsmen.

02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:09.560
What you gotta remember is your average alien is smarter than your average human,

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:13.560
so you gotta be extra careful building your blind if you want a bag one.

02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:15.560
You hunt aliens?

02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:20.560
Son, after nailing an alien, you can never go back to quails.

02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:21.560
Nailing?

02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:27.560
You can get one of those and just swap me.

02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:31.560
Line your blind with lead to fool their sensing machines.

02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:33.560
Lay real quiet and wait.

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:36.560
Preferably in the woods around the nuclear base.

02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:38.560
Oh, they love messing around out there.

02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:41.560
Why not wait outside your field, clan?

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:44.560
Wait for them to come a-carving.

02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:47.560
Oh, they do their crop doodles with zap guns, you dirty fool.

02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:48.560
Don't you know nothing?

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:49.560
Don't you know nothing?

02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:52.560
There's no place to put the blind out in the field.

02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:56.560
Now you listen to Clem Parsons if you want to tag in a nursery being.

02:31:56.560 --> 02:32:01.560
They cross the void, wondering what lies beyond,

02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:07.560
all the time not knowing if what awaits them is bookshot.

02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:22.560
Do you guys remember when the U.S. government said aliens were real?

02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:27.560
That was a few months ago, but everyone forgot that they said it before.

02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:32.560
Like during COVID?

02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:44.560
So I feel like everyone's like,

02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:45.560
Aliens are real?

02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:47.560
Didn't they say that already?

02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:52.560
Oh, there's aliens.

02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:54.560
And now I'm like, oh, okay.

02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:03.560
They said it before, and then after that,

02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:05.560
and then after that they announced it again,

02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:07.560
and everyone's like, oh gosh, aliens.

02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:12.560
And I'm like, no, I'm pretty sure they have announced this before.

02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:14.560
I thought it was just UFOs the first time.

02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:16.560
Isn't that still alien-ish?

02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:32.560
Oh wow, I totally believe it.

02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:35.560
I totally believe it, Senpai.

02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:39.560
Why?

02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:42.560
Because maybe we can get married in space.

02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:49.560
We can get married in space.

02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:53.560
I think that'll be nice.

02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:02.560
Did we talk about Pastor Ali again?

02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:14.560
Alarm system.

02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:18.560
Okay, bye.

02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:23.560
Okay, that's a good hint that the alarm system

02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:26.560
is connected to the fire alarm.

02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:28.560
So when that happens...

02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:40.560
Let's go to the lodge first.

02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:43.560
The heck is that?

02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:48.560
Red eyes gleam with eerie malevolence from the darkness.

02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:49.560
What the heck is that?

02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:02.560
Your voice is really deep.

02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:09.560
Your mind touched me, huh?

02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:16.560
Your excitement warmed my attention.

02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:20.560
Do you hunger for true knowledge?

02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:25.560
Speaking of...

02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:29.560
This is Steve's voice actor.

02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:31.560
I can do this too.

02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:37.560
Do you hunger for true knowledge?

02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:43.560
Anyways, Senpai, did you know that I'm always touching you too?

02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:54.560
Did you know that?

02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:02.560
Because every time you hear my voice,

02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:06.560
the bones in your ear is touching.

02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:10.560
Which makes the vibrations for you to hear sound.

02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:14.560
So therefore, I'm always touching you when you hear my voice.

02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:25.560
Isn't that amazing?

02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:26.560
Isn't that amazing?

02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:32.560
Always think about that.

02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:45.560
I'm always touching you, Senpai.

02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:57.560
I'm always touching you, Senpai.

02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:08.560
Anyways, yeah, I wanna join the lodge.

02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:15.560
Okay.

02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:18.560
Paper work? Okay, give me an application, then.

02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:57.560
Well, I can't believe the lodge has bureaucracy.

02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:03.560
Okay.

02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:13.560
Fine, I'll get it.

02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:20.560
Man, why do they always cemetery shady oaks?

02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:23.560
Can I go down here? Fire station, police station.

02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:26.560
Meat plant.

02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:31.560
I'll stop this.

02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:32.560
How'd I convince him?

02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:34.560
Maybe I can get a clue.

02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:50.560
Hmm.

02:38:58.560 --> 02:38:59.560
Hmm.

02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:02.560
What should I do?

02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:05.560
Big sale, big sale.

02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:08.560
What should I do?

02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:11.560
Hmm.

02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:14.560
It hasn't exactly said anything yet.

02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:18.560
I don't think, yeah, I don't think I can convince him just yet.

02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:21.560
Missile base.

02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:40.560
Why is he doing yoga or does he have no legs?

02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:48.560
Oddly enough, this guard booth is the only building in the base.

02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:02.560
Section 21?

02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:07.560
Okay.

02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:18.560
Is there anyone being drafted right now?

02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:27.560
Buster?

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:36.560
Pink?

02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:39.560
What's wrong with pink? I love pink.

02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:52.560
Wait, are we still in the Cold War?

02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:56.560
Are we still in the Cold War?

02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:06.560
Okay.

02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:11.560
That's right.

02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:14.560
Been in charge here since WW2.

02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:17.560
But I got my lower torso showing up.

02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:18.560
No, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:19.560
You're not doing yoga.

02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:23.560
Those panty wastes in Washington wanted to stick me behind a desk.

02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:24.560
To hell with that.

02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:25.560
They owed me.

02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:28.560
I left my legs in Düsseldorf.

02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:30.560
They owed me.

02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:36.560
Of course they felt that after the trauma of having to crawl from Germany to England,

02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:38.560
trailing my intestines behind me.

02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:42.560
It was too emotionally unstable to continue in the military.

02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:43.560
Fair.

02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:48.560
That's why they gave me this nice cushy job and put me in charge of the nuclear missiles.

02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:52.560
Can I talk?

02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:53.560
The button?

02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:55.560
Why are you asking about the button, son?

02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:57.560
I'm just a little nervous about it.

02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:00.560
I mean, suppose an accident happens.

02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:03.560
Don't get your panties in a bunch, mister.

02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:06.560
The button is perfectly safe.

02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:09.560
I keep it on my person all the time.

02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:11.560
Is that a hint?

02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:15.560
No commie bastard is getting his mitts on this button.

02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:17.560
No, sorry, Bob.

02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:22.560
No one initiates a nuclear holocaust and harvest except me.

02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:25.560
Doesn't that make you feel better?

02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:26.560
Yeah?

02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:30.560
Harvest?

02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:32.560
Harvest is a fine town.

02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:35.560
Steeped in traditional American values.

02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:37.560
But that lodge...

02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:39.560
Well, it makes me suspicious.

02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:41.560
Don't mind saying it.

02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:44.560
They've got their fingers into everything around here.

02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:49.560
Like a certain red commie bastard, Menace, which will be nameless.

02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:54.560
Ow, stay away from the lodge.

02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:56.560
You read me wrong, mister.

02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:59.560
I think you should join the lodge, infiltrate it,

02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:02.560
and report back on any red sympathizers.

02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:03.560
Okay, I'll do that.

02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:07.560
That would affect my decision on what I've got to do.

02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:11.560
Okay, commie bastard.

02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:15.560
Frankly, all these questions are making me a little suspicious of you.

02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:18.560
Maybe you're one of those pink-blooded Americans.

02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:19.560
What's pink-blooded?

02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:23.560
Can you give me any reason why I shouldn't shoot you right now?

02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:28.560
No, not really.

02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:32.560
I appreciate your honesty, comrade.

02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:33.560
Eh?

02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.560
Eh?

02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:40.560
Eh?

02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:56.560
Okay.

02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:10.560
What did I do?

02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:12.560
I just caused nuclear!

02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:14.560
I caused a holocaust?

02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:21.560
What's pink anyways?

02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:33.560
What about...?

02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:39.560
They've got lower torso.

02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:04.560
I think it was a slang for American with communist sympathies.

02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:05.560
Okay!

02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:34.560
It's okay.

02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:04.560
Hi.

02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:08.560
Okay.

02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:13.560
Where's the exit?

02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:23.560
Can I ask him some more questions?

02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:25.560
Or is that it?

02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:28.560
Does he give any necessary hints?

02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:36.560
Okay, I'll ask some more.

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:44.560
Lamas?

02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:47.560
Lamas?

02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:52.560
Is that a yes or a no?

02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:04.560
Uh...

02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:06.560
What, Lamas?

02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:08.560
No?

02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:34.560
Okay.

02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:40.560
I guess I gotta infiltrate the fire...

02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:42.560
department.

02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:56.560
Oh.

02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:03.560
Fair.

02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:07.560
Fair, fair.

02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:08.560
Very fair.

02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:11.560
Oh, art!

02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:12.560
Ooh, doggy!

02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:15.560
saliva is foaming from his...

02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:17.560
from his barking chops.

02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:21.560
Decorative Oriental fans from Ming Dynasty.

02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:25.560
A picture of phallic-like structure standing in a roll.

02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:27.560
Compressionist landscape.

02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:31.560
Picture of a storybook fairy castle.

02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:34.560
Don't bother me, I'm sketching.

02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:36.560
Oh, look what you made me do!

02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:39.560
Hello, Steve!

02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:42.560
Welcome to the House of Flame, as we like to call it.

02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:44.560
Oh, cut it out, Spots.

02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:45.560
Honestly.

02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:47.560
Once it gets barking, a good piece of meat

02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:49.560
is the only way to shut him up.

02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:54.560
There you go, Spots.

02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:55.560
There you go, Spots.

02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:56.560
Aw.

02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:12.560
It's nice to meet you, Sparky!

02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:17.560
Oh my god, I just love your outfit!

02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:22.560
I respect them.

02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:23.560
I respect them.

02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:29.560
Why did you hear about my memory loss?

02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:38.560
Oh, another kidder, huh?

02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:52.560
Such as...

02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:53.560
Such as?

02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:00.560
Mom, huh?

02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:19.560
That sounds fantastic!

02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:22.560
Don't be such a party group, Steve.

02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:24.560
We're talking about art.

02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:26.560
We're talking about art here, okay?

02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:28.560
We haven't had a flowery heart

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:31.560
since the newspaper building burned down.

02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:33.560
So I'll admit that the wasp woman's place

02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:36.560
is one big accident waiting to happen.

02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:38.560
Isn't that right, Spots?

02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:40.560
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.

02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:42.560
Yeah, that place is a safety hazard.

02:50:45.560 --> 02:50:48.560
Oh well, let's talk about art.

02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:50.560
Love art.

02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:52.560
It does!

02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:10.560
Provocative, you say?

02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:17.560
You're right, it is beneath me.

02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:21.560
Hey, newspaper fire.

02:51:21.560 --> 02:51:23.560
A dreadful affair.

02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:25.560
You wouldn't think that a brick-and-steel building

02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:28.560
with a sprinkler system could go up that quickly.

02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:30.560
You're right.

02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:35.560
You think it was arson?

02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:37.560
Oh, please.

02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:39.560
Dwayne was glad enough.

02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:41.560
You're right.

02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:42.560
You're right.

02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:43.560
You're right.

02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:44.560
You're right.

02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:45.560
You're right.

02:51:45.560 --> 02:51:46.560
You're right.

02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:47.560
Please.

02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:50.560
Dwayne was glad enough to see the thing go up.

02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:52.560
And so was McKnight.

02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:56.560
If you could get into that safe in his wall...

02:51:56.560 --> 02:51:58.560
Oh, get it.

02:51:58.560 --> 02:51:59.560
I know.

02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:02.560
As far as I know, the fire was an accident.

02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:04.560
Let's just leave it at that.

02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:06.560
So it wasn't an accident.

02:52:06.560 --> 02:52:08.560
How don't you go moving?

02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:12.560
Hey, wasp woman?

02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:15.560
Some people think all we do is sit around

02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:19.560
sketching betting examples of manhood for our own amusement.

02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:22.560
Nothing could be further from the truth.

02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:24.560
Why, just the other day,

02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:28.560
we decided to take a crumb for firecoat violations.

02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:31.560
All the dried-up paper-walked nests

02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:33.560
clustered around our wooden house.

02:52:33.560 --> 02:52:36.560
Why, it's a kenlog just waiting for the right faggot.

02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:37.560
Ah!

02:52:37.560 --> 02:52:40.560
Believe me, none of us wants to see another fiasco

02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:42.560
like the Sentinel fire.

02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:47.560
Bye-bye.

02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:50.560
Can't talk now, Steve, I'm inspired.

02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:54.560
Bye-bye.

02:52:54.560 --> 02:52:57.560
I don't converse on the job, Steve.

02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:13.560
YouTube!

02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:17.560
YouTube, this is a part of the game.

02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:19.560
It's just a different time.

02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:21.560
We understand respectfully that this,

02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:24.560
that, that, um,

02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:27.560
that these are outdated terms.

02:53:27.560 --> 02:53:29.560
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:35.560
Can't talk now.

02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:37.560
Bye-bye.

02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:40.560
I don't con-

02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:43.560
Stop it, you're messing me up!

02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:50.560
Wait, is there a fireplace in there?

02:53:53.560 --> 02:53:56.560
Actually, just waiting to happen.

02:53:57.560 --> 02:54:01.560
I like that the fire thingy is pink.

02:54:01.560 --> 02:54:05.560
Oh, wait, wait, no, I can ask about communism, right?

02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:09.560
Can't talk now, Steve.

02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:14.560
Communism, do I spell it right?

02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:16.560
Come again?

02:54:16.560 --> 02:54:18.560
Are you, uh...

02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:21.560
Come again?

02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:23.560
Pink?

02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:25.560
Come again?

02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:28.560
L-la-launch?

02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:31.560
Come again?

02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:33.560
Okay, bye.

02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:35.560
Bye-bye.

02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:39.560
I guess that's fine.

02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:53.560
Newspaper building.

02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:59.560
What's left at the newspaper building after an extreme fire?

02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:03.560
Chevrolet's sticking out of the building's ashes.

02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:05.560
Can I grab it?

02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:07.560
I want it, I want it!

02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:09.560
Yeah.

02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:14.560
At least the plumbing held up.

02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:16.560
That's good plumbing.

02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:27.560
What about police station?

02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:34.560
The cop ignores you, you're too busy writing a bug report.

02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:44.560
The pot hisses at you from its perch.

02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:47.560
Hmm, a map of harvest.

02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:54.560
Hello, Steve. Let me introduce myself.

02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:56.560
I'm Sheriff Dwayne Dwayne.

02:55:56.560 --> 02:55:58.560
D-Dwayne Dwayne, huh?

02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:00.560
Pleasure, I reckon.

02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:03.560
Then, we haven't met before?

02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:05.560
Of course we have.

02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:08.560
But I heard about your alleged amnesia and figured I'd play along.

02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:11.560
I sure hope this is just a prank.

02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:14.560
And not the start of some insanity play.

02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:17.560
Keep your nose clean or you'll wind up in jail.

02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:20.560
And that's no place to hold a wedding.

02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:22.560
Alright, amnesia.

02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:26.560
Why do you want to break your poor mama's heart with all this amnesia bug?

02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:28.560
I'm telling you the truth.

02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:31.560
Oh geez, Steve, calm down.

02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:33.560
You've always been a kidder, Steve.

02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:35.560
Kidder count!

02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:39.560
Boy, you need to stop all this funning and get serious.

02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:41.560
You've got a wedding coming up soon.

02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:44.560
Heck, you should be thinking about your career

02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:47.560
and about joining the lodge.

02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:49.560
Wedding.

02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:51.560
Amnesia or no.

02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:55.560
You can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing at harvest.

02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:59.560
I think you and Stephanie are perfect for each other.

02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:03.560
I just hope her father's disappointment doesn't spoil everything.

02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:04.560
Disappointment?

02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:05.560
Disappointment?

02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:08.560
Mr. Potsdam wants to hold the wedding in the lodge.

02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:10.560
But he'll never get in.

02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:15.560
Like all the rest, he's always hanging around the post office the first day of the month.

02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:19.560
Waiting for Boyle to bring out that much lodge applications.

02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:21.560
There's always a long line.

02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:24.560
Never enough applications to go around.

02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:29.560
And even if you do get an application, chances are you're right out of luck.

02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:33.560
If you recall to the order and even less accepted.

02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:34.560
And Potsdam?

02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:38.560
Well, they've turned him down so many times.

02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:42.560
Unless he does something radical, he'll never get in.

02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:45.560
Okay, let's check crime.

02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:49.560
Crime wise, nothing much has happened in harvest since the newspaper fire.

02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:50.560
Oh, sure.

02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:54.560
Every week or so, we get the odd transient dropping dead.

02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:57.560
But other than that, it gets...

02:57:57.560 --> 02:57:59.560
Every old, huh?

02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:05.560
Pertiest!

02:58:09.560 --> 02:58:11.560
Good night and got a road trip tomorrow.

02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:12.560
Need some sleep.

02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:13.560
Good night.

02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:14.560
Good luck on your road trip.

02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:16.560
I don't remember anything.

02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:26.560
I don't remember anything.

02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:33.560
Kitter count.

02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:39.560
Who's the perp?

02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:42.560
We found the gas can that was used.

02:58:42.560 --> 02:58:44.560
Yes, sorry, Bob.

02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:47.560
It's in the evidence room.

02:58:47.560 --> 02:58:50.560
That's classified, darn it.

02:58:50.560 --> 02:58:55.560
How many times are you gonna have to tell me to keep my mouth shut?

02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:56.560
I wonder.

02:58:56.560 --> 02:58:58.560
Sorry, boss.

02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:00.560
It's okay there, partner.

02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:14.560
Who can make out all those curvy lines anyhow?

02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:17.560
No, it's sitting in there gathering dust.

02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:19.560
Clean is the day we found it.

02:59:19.560 --> 02:59:22.560
Just in case I ever need a spare gas can.

02:59:22.560 --> 02:59:25.560
Huh, okay, they don't do their job well.

02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:30.560
I'm sorry, let me try that again.

02:59:30.560 --> 02:59:32.560
Ah, chocks.

02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:34.560
They don't do their job well.

02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:41.560
Dang it, and tell me about my amnesia.

02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:46.560
Why do you want to break your poor mama's heart with all this amnesia bunk?

02:59:46.560 --> 02:59:48.560
I'm telling you the truth.

02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:49.560
Okay, got it.

02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:50.560
Yeah.

02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:52.560
Boy, you need to stop all.

02:59:53.560 --> 02:59:55.560
Why about my win?

02:59:55.560 --> 02:59:59.560
You can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing.

02:59:59.560 --> 03:00:00.560
Right.

03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:01.560
Mr. Potts.

03:00:05.560 --> 03:00:07.560
What about the Lodge?

03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:09.560
I don't mind telling you.

03:00:09.560 --> 03:00:12.560
I'd never get anything done if not for the Lodge's efforts.

03:00:12.560 --> 03:00:18.560
To join the order of the harvest moon is the highest dream of everyone in harvest.

03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:25.560
I'm gonna get an application.

03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:32.560
And like I said, unless you get an application on the first day of the month, you're generally out of luck.

03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:33.560
Okay, bye.

03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:35.560
Stop on by any time, Steve.

03:00:35.560 --> 03:00:37.560
Can I go into the evidence room?

03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:39.560
Door is locked.

03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:40.560
Door is locked.

03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:42.560
That's the evidence room.

03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:45.560
Where we store items lifted from crime scenes.

03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:48.560
It's kept locked at all times.

03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:53.560
There's things in there that could make people jump through hoops, if I wanted.

03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:59.560
Oh, you're not only lazy here, but you're also corrupt.

03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:00.560
Solve cases.

03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:02.560
Solve cases.

03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:04.560
Unsolved.

03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:06.560
Unsolved arson.

03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:08.560
Unsolved arson.

03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:12.560
Anything I can help you with?

03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:14.560
That coffee smells good.

03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:16.560
Step yourself.

03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:22.560
Speaking of which, you're real lucky to be marrying Stephanie.

03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:26.560
She don't look like a good woman.

03:01:26.560 --> 03:01:30.560
I just hope she don't turn out like Mrs. Loomis.

03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:34.560
What do you mean she don't look like a good woman?

03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:35.560
Mercy?

03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:37.560
Mercy mentioned?

03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:42.560
Hard on a man's needs, don't you know?

03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:43.560
Stephanie?

03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:48.560
Oh, gosh darn, she's pretty.

03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:55.560
Kind of like a gal I seen on some of their French postcards they used to make.

03:01:55.560 --> 03:01:57.560
Used to be.

03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:01.560
I take them things, go back in the jail.

03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:08.560
There's nobody was there and kind of look them over one handed.

03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:11.560
Hold some towels.

03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:16.560
That was the four Mrs. Loomis.

03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:18.560
Huh?

03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:26.560
Huh?

03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:31.560
Oh, gosh, I wish I had some of them girly pictures.

03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:36.560
But Mrs. Loomis won't let me keep them in the house.

03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:43.560
I still remember the time she caught me holding some of them pictures up with one hand.

03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:47.560
She took the broom to me.

03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:50.560
I held like a hound dog.

03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:52.560
The broom going up and down.

03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:53.560
What?

03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:55.560
I was crawling blood, blood and straw.

03:02:55.560 --> 03:02:56.560
And I brooked.

03:02:56.560 --> 03:02:58.560
I was crying so bad.

03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:03.560
And it was so hard I had to crawl under the porch naked.

03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:08.560
With all the black winter spiders and I got bit something fierce.

03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:14.560
Little things are digging into my bare behind all over.

03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:18.560
I ask you, is that any way to treat a man?

03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:31.560
And Mrs. Phelps and the sheriff don't make it no easier neither.

03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:33.560
Where did that broom go?

03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:35.560
What did he mean?

03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:37.560
Up and down?

03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:44.560
Where did it go?

03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:45.560
Oh, wait.

03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:46.560
You're right.

03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:47.560
He's cheating.

03:03:47.560 --> 03:03:48.560
No, he deserved that.

03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:52.560
You're right.

03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:53.560
You're right.

03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:54.560
You're right.

03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:55.560
He is a cheater.

03:03:55.560 --> 03:04:04.560
We don't like, we don't like his kind.

03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:10.560
Mrs. Phelps down at the general store don't help things, none.

03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:13.560
She's got them special picture books.

03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:15.560
The one with the ladies.

03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:21.560
But she won't sell me none on account of she knows my wife, Mrs. Loomis.

03:04:21.560 --> 03:04:25.560
That gum that don't burn my bridges.

03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:32.560
If I even ask about them, she tells Mrs. Loomis and I get the broom.

03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:34.560
Enough to break a man's heart.

03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:37.560
Her burning my French postcards.

03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:41.560
We unable to replace them.

03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:43.560
We don't like cheaters.

03:04:43.560 --> 03:04:47.560
You have a wonderful wife.

03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:48.560
Man's need.

03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:55.560
Why, you sure ought to appreciate what a man's got to do sometimes in a parked car

03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:59.560
or waste hide not hole in a tree.

03:04:59.560 --> 03:05:00.560
A what?

03:05:00.560 --> 03:05:01.560
A tree?

03:05:01.560 --> 03:05:09.560
Matter of fact, Mrs. Phelps got no reason not to sell you some of them French postcard

03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:11.560
girly picture books.

03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:16.560
If you can get any, it's the clear the park with them.

03:05:17.560 --> 03:05:26.560
The sheriff's at lunch and I'd be obliged.

03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:27.560
French postcards.

03:05:27.560 --> 03:05:28.560
Of course.

03:05:28.560 --> 03:05:31.560
I don't necessarily mean French postcards.

03:05:31.560 --> 03:05:32.560
Oh.

03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:35.560
That's just what we called them in my day.

03:05:35.560 --> 03:05:43.560
In a kind of girly picture book, the kind men like would be just dandy.

03:05:43.560 --> 03:05:48.560
I'd be right right, kiddo, if you were to bring me one.

03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:49.560
That's the hint.

03:05:49.560 --> 03:05:50.560
Got it.

03:05:50.560 --> 03:05:51.560
Okay.

03:05:51.560 --> 03:05:53.560
What if I say fuck?

03:05:53.560 --> 03:05:58.560
Don't know what you mean, kiddo.

03:05:58.560 --> 03:05:59.560
Broom?

03:05:59.560 --> 03:06:00.560
Don't know.

03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:01.560
Okay, never mind.

03:06:01.560 --> 03:06:02.560
Bye.

03:06:02.560 --> 03:06:03.560
Anytime, kiddo.

03:06:13.560 --> 03:06:20.560
Oh, let's go to diner.

03:06:20.560 --> 03:06:26.560
1955 frag 100 with a real leather leather seat.

03:06:26.560 --> 03:06:39.560
Even from the ground, you can hear this sonorous, sonorous, sonorous buzz of neon.

03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:42.560
Oh, wait, the sheriff's here.

03:06:42.560 --> 03:06:43.560
Hi.

03:06:43.560 --> 03:06:44.560
What's your name?

03:06:44.560 --> 03:06:45.560
Karen.

03:06:45.560 --> 03:06:46.560
What are you doing?

03:06:46.560 --> 03:06:47.560
Playing.

03:06:47.560 --> 03:06:51.560
My mom is working, so I gotta stutter her hair.

03:06:51.560 --> 03:06:52.560
Wanna play?

03:06:52.560 --> 03:06:54.560
Not now, maybe later.

03:06:54.560 --> 03:06:55.560
Okay.

03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:56.560
Bye-bye.

03:06:56.560 --> 03:06:57.560
Oh.

03:06:57.560 --> 03:07:01.560
Why is she the normal one?

03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:08.560
So nice, so no.

03:07:08.560 --> 03:07:11.560
Can we get a picture book for the cage?

03:07:11.560 --> 03:07:23.560
Oh, you want some pretty French postcards for the cage?

03:07:23.560 --> 03:07:25.560
But be a lower one.

03:07:25.560 --> 03:07:26.560
Maybe.

03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:27.560
Maybe.

03:07:27.560 --> 03:07:30.560
But then Senpai, you're mine.

03:07:30.560 --> 03:07:39.560
Dude, you only want pretty pictures of me, right?

03:07:39.560 --> 03:07:45.560
Just me.

03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:47.560
Good.

03:07:47.560 --> 03:07:49.560
A coloring book?

03:07:49.560 --> 03:07:53.560
You want pencil crayons or crayon crayon?

03:07:53.560 --> 03:08:06.560
Oh, I'm afraid to give my Senpai's crayons though, but you might eat it.

03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:13.560
You might eat it, just like glue.

03:08:13.560 --> 03:08:25.560
I knew you would, I knew you would do that, so no coloring books for my Senpai's.

03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:32.560
None, none, none, none.

03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:44.560
Oh, she has a nice voice.

03:08:44.560 --> 03:08:53.560
You know me?

03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:56.560
I guess I've changed.

03:08:56.560 --> 03:08:58.560
I'm not kidding.

03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:09.560
Cheebie!

03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:12.560
Cheebie!

03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:15.560
Cheebie!

03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:19.560
And me!

03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:21.560
And me and Cheebie!

03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:25.560
Welcome to the stream!

03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:27.560
My girls are here.

03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:29.560
Shut the fuck up!

03:09:29.560 --> 03:09:38.560
My girls are here!

03:09:38.560 --> 03:09:48.560
I'm so happy!

03:09:48.560 --> 03:09:54.560
Wow, how was, how was Call of the Lamb?

03:09:54.560 --> 03:09:57.560
How was Call of the Lamb?

03:09:57.560 --> 03:10:00.560
I can't tell, but in me ready to, I didn't see a message.

03:10:00.560 --> 03:10:02.560
Alright, it's in me just here watching me.

03:10:02.560 --> 03:10:09.560
Oh, if it's in me just here watching me, I'll be, I'll be a good, I'll be a good.

03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:12.560
She streamed for like nine hours.

03:10:12.560 --> 03:10:17.560
Trying to, trying to catch up with Mame.

03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:18.560
Just watching Cheebie.

03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:21.560
Make sense, make sense.

03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:23.560
Hello and good night.

03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:24.560
Enjoy Harvester.

03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:25.560
It's such a silly game.

03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:26.560
Oh, thank you, Cheebie.

03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:29.560
I didn't read, I just came out from Cheebie's stream.

03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:30.560
That's no problem.

03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:31.560
Thank you.

03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:32.560
Thank you, girlies.

03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:35.560
The two, two, two blonde girlies.

03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:36.560
Ten.

03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:38.560
Oh, yeah.

03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:45.560
Like Mame, like daughter.

03:10:45.560 --> 03:10:58.560
I think, I think we all take a bit of Mame's, Mame's aspects.

03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:10.560
I think we, I think we do.

03:11:10.560 --> 03:11:11.560
Good night, Cheebie.

03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:14.560
Talk to you in.

03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:17.560
What, did you inherit Mercy?

03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:20.560
They can't, you know, burps.

03:11:20.560 --> 03:11:21.560
Occasionally.

03:11:21.560 --> 03:11:27.560
I don't think I have done it yet, but sometimes I do.

03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:32.560
Good night.

03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:37.560
I'll always say excuse me though.

03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:43.560
What else did I inherit?

03:11:43.560 --> 03:11:55.560
I'll have to ask Mame.

03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:57.560
A shark, what?

03:11:57.560 --> 03:11:59.560
Do you think I'm pretty shark?

03:11:59.560 --> 03:12:01.560
Well, of course I am.

03:12:01.560 --> 03:12:11.560
Look at these scissors.

03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:15.560
I don't burp as much as Emi or Mame though.

03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:25.560
I think I heard Emi say that she can do it on command, and that's really, that's really amazing.

03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:27.560
That's really amazing.

03:12:27.560 --> 03:12:30.560
Me on the other hand, I can't do it on command.

03:12:30.560 --> 03:12:38.560
Anytime that happens, it'll be, it'll be by accident.

03:12:38.560 --> 03:12:40.560
It's not hard to burp.

03:12:40.560 --> 03:12:41.560
It's kind of hard for me.

03:12:41.560 --> 03:12:45.560
I don't like, I can't, like, whistling and can't do it.

03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:50.560
I can't do it.

03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:52.560
Well, everyone can burp on command?

03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:57.560
Am I the only one left out?

03:12:57.560 --> 03:12:59.560
Could I compete for number one against Mame?

03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:06.560
You might be able to, Emi.

03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:08.560
I probably can't.

03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:10.560
I probably can't.

03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:24.560
Sometimes mine accidentally gets really loud, but I think it's because when I drink water, the air gets stuck because my uvula is kind of enlarged so it might get caught behind it.

03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:27.560
That's, that's Ethereum, not quite sure.

03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:32.560
And then I let out a big one, but I don't think it's a record, but I haven't yet.

03:13:32.560 --> 03:13:35.560
I sneeze a lot more than I burp though.

03:13:35.560 --> 03:14:04.560
I never realized it, but after like seeing my, one time seeing my sneeze together, I was like, oh, I sneeze the same way over and over.

03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:26.560
You breathe in while lifting your palate or something until you hear a little pop and you exhale and burp.

03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:33.560
I think I just feel coffee from that.

03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:34.560
Hey, Karen.

03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:36.560
You've met Karen, my eight year old.

03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:37.560
Oh, she's so cute.

03:14:37.560 --> 03:14:39.560
Other than the diner, she's all I have.

03:14:39.560 --> 03:14:41.560
Oh!

03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:47.560
No, something bad's gonna happen, I feel it.

03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:52.560
Ah!

03:14:52.560 --> 03:14:55.560
Hey, Kohai, what's the tea of the day?

03:14:55.560 --> 03:15:10.560
Orange ginger.

03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:12.560
Yeah, I don't think I don't want to burp.

03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:13.560
Thank you.

03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:14.560
Let's not burp right now.

03:15:14.560 --> 03:15:15.560
I don't want to force it.

03:15:15.560 --> 03:15:16.560
I might get sick.

03:15:16.560 --> 03:15:24.560
I feel a little sick probably because I've been a little unwell, probably because I've kind of overworked myself.

03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:25.560
This is an entirely full week.

03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:29.560
I'm actually probably, I'm thinking I might move a few weeks.

03:15:29.560 --> 03:15:33.560
Wait, I might feel a burp.

03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:38.560
Is it working?

03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:47.560
No, nothing.

03:15:47.560 --> 03:15:48.560
No, nothing.

03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:59.560
But yeah, I'm a little sick because I think I've overworked myself a little bit.

03:15:59.560 --> 03:16:07.560
Because I might lower my schedule for next week because I really need a big break, at least a day of rest.

03:16:07.560 --> 03:16:17.560
Because even when I'm off streaming, I still have to keep up that social media presence as well.

03:16:17.560 --> 03:16:20.560
And then I have to think of things and events to do.

03:16:20.560 --> 03:16:33.560
And then I have to work on my audios and then additional videos if possible.

03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:37.560
So it doesn't sound like a lot, but it takes a lot of time for all of them.

03:16:37.560 --> 03:16:39.560
And it takes a lot of energy.

03:16:39.560 --> 03:16:41.560
It could be due to stress too.

03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:45.560
I should probably rest up a little more.

03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:49.560
But I want this tomorrow is the last day of the full week.

03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:56.560
So hopefully I can find some way to slow down a little bit.

03:16:56.560 --> 03:17:01.560
So yeah, everyone can see all types of games that I play.

03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:03.560
Wait, did I talk about Stephanie already?

03:17:03.560 --> 03:17:07.560
There isn't a nicer girl in Harvest than Stephanie, Steve.

03:17:07.560 --> 03:17:10.560
You should be grateful that she's promised you her hand.

03:17:10.560 --> 03:17:13.560
I don't remember that happening, Edna.

03:17:13.560 --> 03:17:17.560
Honestly, you men are so childish.

03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:22.560
I don't know what it is about marriage that turns even the bravest man into a coward.

03:17:22.560 --> 03:17:27.560
I was going to marry Karen's father when he just up and ran out on me one night.

03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:28.560
We hate him.

03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:30.560
I heard that he joined the lodge.

03:17:30.560 --> 03:17:32.560
But if he did, I never saw him come out again.

03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:38.560
Even Sheriff Dwayne wasn't able to find out what happened to him.

03:17:38.560 --> 03:17:43.560
Mr. Johnson has a liking for me.

03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:47.560
I call it a crush, but that's too innocent a word.

03:17:47.560 --> 03:17:51.560
He's a bitter man with too much time on his hands.

03:17:51.560 --> 03:17:54.560
He's never gotten over being rejected by the lodge.

03:17:54.560 --> 03:17:58.560
And there's something unwholesome in the way he looks at me.

03:17:58.560 --> 03:18:03.560
I'm always glad when the sheriff comes in every day at noon.

03:18:03.560 --> 03:18:07.560
The lodge is the repository of all wisdom.

03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:10.560
You should join the order of the Harvest Moon, Steve.

03:18:10.560 --> 03:18:12.560
And soon.

03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:13.560
Why?

03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:14.560
And soon.

03:18:14.560 --> 03:18:16.560
I'd say, what is it about this place?

03:18:16.560 --> 03:18:19.560
The wheat ripens and waits not for the sigh.

03:18:19.560 --> 03:18:21.560
The farmer who waits too long.

03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:22.560
Wait.

03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:26.560
He used the sigh to rip his own stomach out then to stay his side when the wheat ripens.

03:18:26.560 --> 03:18:29.560
The Harvest Moon wanes and then comes winter.

03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:30.560
An empty belly.

03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:31.560
The body stands.

03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:32.560
The body stands, belly.

03:18:32.560 --> 03:18:34.560
Lurgling within or bloody on the ground.

03:18:34.560 --> 03:18:38.560
What does it benefit a man if he gains his soul and loses the world?

03:18:38.560 --> 03:18:40.560
You hunger.

03:18:40.560 --> 03:18:42.560
Feed yourself.

03:18:42.560 --> 03:18:44.560
Before it's too late.

03:18:44.560 --> 03:18:45.560
Late.

03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:46.560
Oh.

03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:48.560
What's wrong?

03:18:48.560 --> 03:18:50.560
Steve.

03:18:50.560 --> 03:18:54.560
Well, what happened?

03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:57.560
Were we talking about Boyle?

03:18:57.560 --> 03:18:58.560
Or was it Karen?

03:18:58.560 --> 03:19:00.560
You seem strange there for a minute.

03:19:00.560 --> 03:19:02.560
I'm sorry.

03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:04.560
I'm under a lot of stress.

03:19:04.560 --> 03:19:07.560
Running this diner all alone.

03:19:07.560 --> 03:19:10.560
Forgive me.

03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:14.560
You've met Karen.

03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:15.560
Bye.

03:19:15.560 --> 03:19:17.560
Stop by anytime, Steve.

03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:18.560
Hello there, Steve.

03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:19.560
Here for lunch?

03:19:19.560 --> 03:19:20.560
Yep.

03:19:20.560 --> 03:19:21.560
No.

03:19:21.560 --> 03:19:22.560
Just here looking around.

03:19:22.560 --> 03:19:25.560
Well, I'm not entirely sure where here is.

03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:27.560
She's under a lot of stress, Boyle.

03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:30.560
You need a break before you start speaking in tongues.

03:19:30.560 --> 03:19:34.560
Well, Boyle, this is DNA's diner.

03:19:34.560 --> 03:19:35.560
Isn't that right, Edna?

03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:37.560
Don't listen to Sheriff Dwayne.

03:19:37.560 --> 03:19:39.560
This is Edna's diner.

03:19:39.560 --> 03:19:41.560
But ever since the E burned out on the sign,

03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:43.560
they've been giving me a hard time.

03:19:43.560 --> 03:19:45.560
Now, don't be like that, Edna.

03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:48.560
It's a great place to eat, which is good.

03:19:48.560 --> 03:19:51.560
Since it's the only place to eat in harvest.

03:19:51.560 --> 03:19:52.560
Bye.

03:19:52.560 --> 03:19:59.560
Stop on by anytime, Steve.

03:19:59.560 --> 03:20:03.560
Oh, how do I exit?

03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:04.560
Oh, here it is.

03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:05.560
Oh, wait.

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:11.560
Is there anything else I should look at?

03:20:11.560 --> 03:20:19.560
Well, the diner people seem nice.

03:20:19.560 --> 03:20:21.560
Oh, wrong place.

03:20:21.560 --> 03:20:28.560
I meant to go to the thing.

03:20:28.560 --> 03:20:44.560
Is he still at the police station?

03:20:44.560 --> 03:20:46.560
Hold on.

03:20:46.560 --> 03:21:02.560
Just in case.

03:21:02.560 --> 03:21:06.560
Here's your girly magazine.

03:21:06.560 --> 03:21:11.560
Oh, oh, by George.

03:21:11.560 --> 03:21:13.560
Oh, by Jiminy.

03:21:13.560 --> 03:21:20.560
Oh, can I have it?

03:21:20.560 --> 03:21:21.560
Yeah.

03:21:21.560 --> 03:21:24.560
Oh, thank you, Steve.

03:21:24.560 --> 03:21:26.560
Excuse me, kiddo.

03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:39.560
I've got to go check the jail for clean towels.

03:21:39.560 --> 03:21:44.560
Oh, yeah.

03:21:44.560 --> 03:21:48.560
Now the evidence room is mine.

03:21:48.560 --> 03:21:52.560
Never mind.

03:21:52.560 --> 03:21:57.560
This fairly legible note.

03:21:57.560 --> 03:22:01.560
Checkbook.

03:22:01.560 --> 03:22:08.560
Give me the key.

03:22:08.560 --> 03:22:35.560
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to click that exit.

03:22:35.560 --> 03:22:39.560
Give me the stuff.

03:22:39.560 --> 03:22:43.560
A berry.

03:22:43.560 --> 03:22:47.560
Arbus brand, old brand of smokes.

03:22:47.560 --> 03:22:51.560
Where is it?

03:22:51.560 --> 03:22:54.560
Beer.

03:22:54.560 --> 03:23:00.560
There it is.

03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:03.560
Anything else?

03:23:03.560 --> 03:23:18.560
I didn't work like that, too.

03:23:18.560 --> 03:23:21.560
Is there anything else?

03:23:21.560 --> 03:23:35.560
Is there anything else in here?

03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:39.560
Take the shoes.

03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:41.560
The bear?

03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:44.560
Bear is wielding a chainsaw.

03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:50.560
What's with all these models?

03:23:50.560 --> 03:23:52.560
There's another woman's body.

03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:54.560
Oh, I'm surprised.

03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:57.560
Loomis has painted this evidence.

03:23:57.560 --> 03:24:05.560
Bottom right here.

03:24:05.560 --> 03:24:07.560
Hello, Steve.

03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:15.560
Where's Loomis?

03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:19.560
Loomis, have you?

03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:34.560
No.

03:24:34.560 --> 03:24:37.560
Did I fuck up?

03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:57.560
Okay, I can go back in again.

03:24:57.560 --> 03:25:05.560
Is there anything else I can grab?

03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:09.560
Loomis's light relatives.

03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:14.560
Prop helps the sheriff meet a ticket quota.

03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:37.560
Is there anything else in here?

03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:43.560
Okay, if there's nothing else, let's get out of here.

03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:53.560
Door's locked.

03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:59.560
TV station.

03:25:59.560 --> 03:26:09.560
Sorry, I meant to go to Edna's diner.

03:26:09.560 --> 03:26:12.560
Oh, he's back here again, okay.

03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:30.560
Okay, bye.

03:26:30.560 --> 03:26:36.560
Okay, let's do...

03:26:36.560 --> 03:26:41.560
Let's go to the TV station.

03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:45.560
Let's go to the game.

03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:47.560
As long as we don't fuck up.

03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:49.560
Oh, I should have just saved into a different one.

03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:57.560
Too busy drinking and smoking, they ignore you.

03:26:57.560 --> 03:27:10.560
Oh, they found it here.

03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:17.560
Steve.

03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:18.560
Yeah.

03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:23.560
Yeah, yes.

03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:28.560
Oh, TV violence.

03:27:28.560 --> 03:27:39.560
I love all the blood and gore on your show.

03:27:39.560 --> 03:27:43.560
Here's the commentary.

03:27:43.560 --> 03:28:00.560
Just look at the net profits.

03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:04.560
Huh?

03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:11.560
Very poor reception is strange since the broadcast originates from here.

03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:16.560
A picture of a gorgeous model signed with a kiss my pineapple.

03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:21.560
Red and muffy.

03:28:21.560 --> 03:28:27.560
An assortment of empty cubicles, either McKnight loves to recall his salad days as an insurance salesman.

03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:33.560
You can't keep up with him, or you can't keep his employees happy.

03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:35.560
Hey, Sport, this is a private office.

03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:38.560
Yeah, I know, Mr. McKnight.

03:28:38.560 --> 03:28:40.560
I own and operate this station.

03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:43.560
Have you brought me some news for the night broadcast, or...

03:28:43.560 --> 03:28:45.560
I've lost my memory.

03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:46.560
That's news.

03:28:46.560 --> 03:28:48.560
The hell it is.

03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:50.560
You always were a kid, or Steve.

03:28:50.560 --> 03:28:52.560
Any real news to tell me?

03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:55.560
Actually, I was just wanting to know more about the TV station.

03:28:55.560 --> 03:28:56.560
Huh.

03:28:56.560 --> 03:29:00.560
Hey, W-H-A-R is the only television station in Harvest.

03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:04.560
Since the old Sentinel went under, what with the newspaper building burning down and all?

03:29:04.560 --> 03:29:05.560
We're golden.

03:29:05.560 --> 03:29:08.560
Nobody competes with us, Sport.

03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:12.560
Did you burn it down?

03:29:12.560 --> 03:29:16.560
On Quincet.

03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:19.560
Hey, now, Sport, that's an irresponsible allegation.

03:29:19.560 --> 03:29:21.560
I had nothing to do with that fire.

03:29:21.560 --> 03:29:26.560
Just because W-H-A-R may have benefited from it, and I danced on the ashes a little, doesn't mean...

03:29:26.560 --> 03:29:28.560
A little?

03:29:28.560 --> 03:29:30.560
You can share it the way, and give me doubts.

03:29:30.560 --> 03:29:34.560
You seem awfully touchy on the subject, Sport.

03:29:34.560 --> 03:29:38.560
I'm touchy when people try to muscle their way into my business.

03:29:38.560 --> 03:29:43.560
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave my office, and don't come back.

03:29:43.560 --> 03:29:44.560
No.

03:29:44.560 --> 03:29:46.560
Don't hurry back.

03:29:52.560 --> 03:29:57.560
What about the villains?

03:29:57.560 --> 03:29:58.560
Oh, okay.

03:29:58.560 --> 03:30:00.560
What's the first choice?

03:30:14.560 --> 03:30:16.560
Whoa!

03:30:21.560 --> 03:30:23.560
Godless heathen engines.

03:30:23.560 --> 03:30:26.560
Most kids don't see godless heathen engines on a regular basis,

03:30:26.560 --> 03:30:29.560
and if they do, they'd better either get their eyes checked,

03:30:29.560 --> 03:30:32.560
or do like old range rider, and shoot the bejesus out of them.

03:30:32.560 --> 03:30:35.560
Lest they want to go untreated for psychotic hallucinations,

03:30:35.560 --> 03:30:38.560
or wind up with their scalps hanging from a buckskin...

03:30:38.560 --> 03:30:39.560
YouTube!

03:30:39.560 --> 03:30:40.560
Shit!

03:30:40.560 --> 03:30:41.560
Ow!

03:30:41.560 --> 03:30:43.560
Shit on a sticker room!

03:30:47.560 --> 03:30:49.560
YouTube, this is part of game!

03:30:49.560 --> 03:30:52.560
The parents that are griping about violence on TV

03:30:52.560 --> 03:30:56.560
are the same parents that go outside in the morning to fetch their papers,

03:30:56.560 --> 03:31:00.560
secure in the knowledge that they won't get an arrow through the noodle,

03:31:00.560 --> 03:31:05.560
because the violence they hate so much done cleared the engines out of the neighborhood.

03:31:05.560 --> 03:31:09.560
Yeah, civilization has benefited from violence.

03:31:09.560 --> 03:31:12.560
But should violence be treated as entertainment?

03:31:12.560 --> 03:31:14.560
Check my rating, son.

03:31:14.560 --> 03:31:16.560
Violence is entertainment.

03:31:16.560 --> 03:31:18.560
I just put it on the air.

03:31:18.560 --> 03:31:22.560
That says something about the kid, not me.

03:31:22.560 --> 03:31:26.560
Now, excuse me, we're going back on the air.

03:31:27.560 --> 03:31:28.560
Alright.

03:31:30.560 --> 03:31:33.560
Aw, no one's operating the camera.

03:31:35.560 --> 03:31:39.560
A corny western backdrop complete with a cardboard teepee.

03:31:43.560 --> 03:31:44.560
Hmm.

03:31:45.560 --> 03:31:47.560
Either the show isn't compelling,

03:31:47.560 --> 03:31:51.560
or no one wanted to be taken out by friendly...

03:31:51.560 --> 03:31:52.560
by friendly fire.

03:31:52.560 --> 03:31:55.560
A fairly primitive form of mind control.

03:32:09.560 --> 03:32:11.560
We can exit this way.

03:32:14.560 --> 03:32:15.560
The meat plant.

03:32:17.560 --> 03:32:19.560
We should save.

03:32:19.560 --> 03:32:22.560
I don't know, it seems dangerous to go to a meat plant.

03:32:22.560 --> 03:32:25.560
What's with... what is that? Are these cats?

03:32:52.560 --> 03:32:54.560
Cats?

03:32:57.560 --> 03:32:59.560
Is that a bone?

03:33:22.560 --> 03:33:24.560
Steve, I didn't want to believe that amnesia hook'em.

03:33:24.560 --> 03:33:27.560
Now you're saying you don't remember your pal, Pat O'Reilly?

03:33:27.560 --> 03:33:29.560
Pat O'Reilly, huh?

03:33:29.560 --> 03:33:31.560
Oh, let's talk about the family business, I guess.

03:33:31.560 --> 03:33:33.560
Why are they in the meat plant?

03:33:33.560 --> 03:33:36.560
Because daddy owns the meat plant.

03:33:39.560 --> 03:33:42.560
You may come to realize that this business is not for everybody.

03:33:42.560 --> 03:33:45.560
Just ask your poor, ill dad.

03:33:45.560 --> 03:33:48.560
It takes dedication and a strong stomach.

03:33:53.560 --> 03:33:55.560
A lot of times, when I'm finished scrubbing up

03:33:55.560 --> 03:33:58.560
and digging the bits of intestine out from my fingernails,

03:33:58.560 --> 03:34:01.560
I must confess, I don't have much appetite for red meat.

03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:04.560
But red meat is one of the principal food groups,

03:34:04.560 --> 03:34:06.560
and you've got to have it.

03:34:06.560 --> 03:34:08.560
So when you can do this all day,

03:34:08.560 --> 03:34:11.560
and help yourself to a juicy red steak afterwards,

03:34:11.560 --> 03:34:14.560
then by golly, you can call yourself a butcher.

03:34:16.560 --> 03:34:17.560
Alright!

03:34:17.560 --> 03:34:20.560
Of course, amnesia would certainly help that, wouldn't it?

03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:22.560
Dad's on this.

03:34:31.560 --> 03:34:33.560
Does everyone want to get me into lodge?

03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:35.560
Amnesia?

03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:43.560
Kitter count.

03:34:50.560 --> 03:34:53.560
You're gonna need to start behaving like an adult,

03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:56.560
especially if you're gonna take over the family business.

03:34:58.560 --> 03:35:00.560
Family business?

03:35:15.560 --> 03:35:17.560
Meat?

03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:23.560
Where do you keep the animals?

03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:26.560
Does it matter?

03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:29.560
The end product is all the customer cares about, Steve.

03:35:29.560 --> 03:35:31.560
And we only carry the finest meat,

03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:33.560
only the juiciest cuts.

03:35:34.560 --> 03:35:36.560
What do you use?

03:35:36.560 --> 03:35:38.560
Once you take over the business,

03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:40.560
you'll realize the importance of maintaining quality

03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:42.560
while cutting costs.

03:35:42.560 --> 03:35:44.560
We know what we're doing.

03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:45.560
We didn't.

03:35:45.560 --> 03:35:47.560
Would the lodge use us to cater their affairs?

03:35:54.560 --> 03:35:56.560
Good. Could I take some meat to take home?

03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:08.560
Okay, here's a hint.

03:36:08.560 --> 03:36:10.560
Cutting costs.

03:36:14.560 --> 03:36:16.560
If you're cutting up the meat, you'll be privy to them.

03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:18.560
There's always cheaper, better ways to do things.

03:36:18.560 --> 03:36:20.560
If you're creative.

03:36:20.560 --> 03:36:22.560
If you're creative?

03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:26.560
Family business?

03:36:40.560 --> 03:36:42.560
Goodbye!

03:36:44.560 --> 03:36:46.560
That's nice, I guess.

03:36:47.560 --> 03:36:50.560
There are several small animals.

03:36:53.560 --> 03:36:55.560
This used to be a kitty cat.

03:36:55.560 --> 03:36:57.560
Okay, we're eating!

03:36:57.560 --> 03:36:59.560
The plant's eating!

03:36:59.560 --> 03:37:01.560
Cats understood.

03:37:07.560 --> 03:37:09.560
Is there anything else in here?

03:37:09.560 --> 03:37:11.560
Okay, I need a written note.

03:37:14.560 --> 03:37:16.560
Let me go back to my house.

03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:24.560
What do I have?

03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:26.560
Got a pen, newspaper,

03:37:26.560 --> 03:37:28.560
aspirin,

03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:30.560
off-medicine,

03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:32.560
vitamins, tampons.

03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:34.560
What do I have?

03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:36.560
I got a pen, newspaper,

03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:38.560
aspirin,

03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:40.560
off-medicine, vitamins,

03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:42.560
tampons,

03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:44.560
tampons,

03:37:44.560 --> 03:37:46.560
jar of oralu,

03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:48.560
shovel,

03:37:48.560 --> 03:37:50.560
bloody sneakers,

03:37:50.560 --> 03:37:52.560
gas can,

03:37:52.560 --> 03:37:54.560
camera,

03:37:54.560 --> 03:37:56.560
checkbook.

03:37:56.560 --> 03:37:58.560
What does it say? I can't fucking see!

03:37:58.560 --> 03:38:00.560
Deposit boil,

03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:02.560
deposit boil, deposit boil,

03:38:02.560 --> 03:38:04.560
check,

03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:06.560
boil,

03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:08.560
deposit,

03:38:08.560 --> 03:38:10.560
boil, tulip ammunition,

03:38:10.560 --> 03:38:12.560
one crate of shells.

03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:16.560
Oh, it is the war, guys, huh?

03:38:22.560 --> 03:38:24.560
No, right-click to view.

03:38:24.560 --> 03:38:26.560
Sheriff, if you think...

03:38:30.560 --> 03:38:32.560
I'm going to keep paying this...

03:38:36.560 --> 03:38:38.560
forever.

03:38:38.560 --> 03:38:40.560
You are crazy. There are limits.

03:38:40.560 --> 03:38:42.560
Boil.

03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:44.560
Who's Boil again?

03:38:58.560 --> 03:39:00.560
Can I use this?

03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:10.560
Can I use this?

03:39:14.560 --> 03:39:16.560
Meet permission sleep.

03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:18.560
Okay.

03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:38.560
We're saving.

03:39:42.560 --> 03:39:44.560
Check out the windows.

03:39:44.560 --> 03:39:46.560
Like at my house?

03:39:54.560 --> 03:39:56.560
I need...

03:39:56.560 --> 03:39:58.560
It says fill up head screws.

03:39:58.560 --> 03:40:00.560
I don't have screw.

03:40:00.560 --> 03:40:02.560
I don't have a screw unless I use

03:40:02.560 --> 03:40:04.560
like something irrational,

03:40:04.560 --> 03:40:06.560
like a shovel.

03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:08.560
Damn it.

03:40:08.560 --> 03:40:10.560
See?

03:40:14.560 --> 03:40:16.560
It'd be hilarious if it worked.

03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:18.560
Yeah.

03:40:18.560 --> 03:40:20.560
I don't have a knife.

03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:28.560
What does this mean?

03:40:30.560 --> 03:40:32.560
No...

03:40:32.560 --> 03:40:34.560
Why...

03:40:34.560 --> 03:40:36.560
Is the Sheriff blackmailing you?

03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:38.560
That's an interesting item.

03:40:38.560 --> 03:40:40.560
But the fact that you asked me that question

03:40:40.560 --> 03:40:42.560
proves you know nothing.

03:40:44.560 --> 03:40:46.560
I can show these around

03:40:46.560 --> 03:40:48.560
and prove both of you

03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:50.560
are guilty of something.

03:40:50.560 --> 03:40:52.560
You do that, Steve.

03:40:52.560 --> 03:40:54.560
Not knowing what we're guilty of,

03:40:54.560 --> 03:40:56.560
how much trouble can you cause?

03:40:56.560 --> 03:40:58.560
Except for yourself.

03:40:58.560 --> 03:41:00.560
Oh, yeah?

03:41:00.560 --> 03:41:02.560
I want to do it again.

03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:04.560
What does this mean?

03:41:04.560 --> 03:41:06.560
I know why the Sheriff

03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:08.560
is blackmailing you.

03:41:08.560 --> 03:41:10.560
This is unexpected

03:41:10.560 --> 03:41:12.560
and awkward.

03:41:12.560 --> 03:41:14.560
But my luck's been bad ever since Dwayne

03:41:14.560 --> 03:41:16.560
found that darn gas can at the newspaper

03:41:16.560 --> 03:41:18.560
building the day after the fire.

03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:20.560
He has this insane notion that it's mine.

03:41:20.560 --> 03:41:22.560
I pay him not

03:41:22.560 --> 03:41:24.560
because I'm guilty, but because I don't want

03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:26.560
him slurring my good name around harvest.

03:41:26.560 --> 03:41:28.560
Oh, naturally.

03:41:28.560 --> 03:41:30.560
You know, he keeps that gas can

03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:32.560
in the evidence room at his office.

03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:34.560
I'd be really grateful

03:41:34.560 --> 03:41:36.560
to whoever could fetch me that can.

03:41:36.560 --> 03:41:38.560
Grateful enough

03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:40.560
to provide him with a lodge application.

03:41:40.560 --> 03:41:42.560
Oh, and Steve,

03:41:42.560 --> 03:41:44.560
you'll keep this to yourself

03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:46.560
if you're smart.

03:41:50.560 --> 03:41:52.560
I can trade it,

03:41:52.560 --> 03:41:54.560
but I want to see what the fingerprints do.

03:41:58.560 --> 03:42:00.560
Or I don't even have that.

03:42:00.560 --> 03:42:02.560
Can I figure out if he did it or not?

03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:08.560
I'm going to do it anyways.

03:42:08.560 --> 03:42:10.560
Against my better judgment,

03:42:10.560 --> 03:42:12.560
what do you think, Senpai?

03:42:20.560 --> 03:42:22.560
We give it...

03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:24.560
We give it...

03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:28.560
Yes.

03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:40.560
You know, this morning

03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:42.560
as I was making my rounds,

03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:44.560
I noticed an awful lot of television

03:42:44.560 --> 03:42:46.560
aerials on the roofs.

03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:48.560
Seems like more and more each day.

03:42:48.560 --> 03:42:50.560
You got me this can

03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:52.560
just in time, youngster.

03:42:52.560 --> 03:42:54.560
I may have need of it again.

03:42:54.560 --> 03:42:56.560
What do you mean?

03:42:56.560 --> 03:42:58.560
There's another reason why Sheriff Dwayne

03:42:58.560 --> 03:43:00.560
didn't investigate the Sentinel fire.

03:43:00.560 --> 03:43:02.560
If you'd like to get something else

03:43:02.560 --> 03:43:04.560
on the black mailing bastard, check around

03:43:04.560 --> 03:43:06.560
the television station.

03:43:06.560 --> 03:43:08.560
Why do you still can?

03:43:08.560 --> 03:43:10.560
Okay.

03:43:10.560 --> 03:43:12.560
Did I get a launch application thing?

03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:20.560
Can I use the pen on it?

03:43:20.560 --> 03:43:22.560
That's a ticket.

03:43:30.560 --> 03:43:32.560
Can I give this to my brother?

03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:38.560
Okay.

03:43:42.560 --> 03:43:44.560
I hope you understand what he means.

03:43:44.560 --> 03:43:46.560
As in like the...

03:43:48.560 --> 03:43:50.560
The place is going to go down in flames?

03:44:00.560 --> 03:44:02.560
Should I...

03:44:02.560 --> 03:44:04.560
Is there anything at the station

03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:06.560
that I need or that I missed?

03:44:22.560 --> 03:44:24.560
Yes?

03:44:28.560 --> 03:44:30.560
There's an off-shelf thing in the back.

03:44:30.560 --> 03:44:32.560
Okay.

03:44:32.560 --> 03:44:34.560
Nothing.

03:44:44.560 --> 03:44:46.560
What is...

03:44:48.560 --> 03:44:50.560
Where can I get the...

03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:54.560
Get it.

03:45:02.560 --> 03:45:04.560
Okay.

03:45:24.560 --> 03:45:26.560
Oops.

03:45:26.560 --> 03:45:28.560
No, no, no.

03:45:28.560 --> 03:45:30.560
Go back.

03:45:30.560 --> 03:45:32.560
How do I get the number?

03:46:00.560 --> 03:46:02.560
This is your first arrest, Steve.

03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:04.560
You just remember.

03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:06.560
We've got three strikes.

03:46:06.560 --> 03:46:08.560
You're out rule here in harvest.

03:46:08.560 --> 03:46:10.560
But you keep your nose clean.

03:46:10.560 --> 03:46:12.560
You're here.

03:46:16.560 --> 03:46:18.560
So I didn't get arrested?

03:46:24.560 --> 03:46:26.560
Oh, good kiss, good night.

03:46:26.560 --> 03:46:28.560
And I got tucked in. That's nice.

03:46:30.560 --> 03:46:32.560
Okay.

03:46:40.560 --> 03:46:42.560
You're in trouble.

03:46:42.560 --> 03:46:44.560
How does it feel to be a jailbird?

03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:48.560
I think it makes you miss out on stuff though.

03:46:48.560 --> 03:46:50.560
Okay, I'll just...

03:46:50.560 --> 03:46:52.560
Yeah.

03:46:52.560 --> 03:46:54.560
What are you yet?

03:46:54.560 --> 03:46:56.560
You better not get caught against, Steve.

03:46:56.560 --> 03:46:58.560
You played your get-out jail-free card.

03:46:58.560 --> 03:47:00.560
Next time, you'll be in...

03:47:02.560 --> 03:47:04.560
Does that make me miss things?

03:47:04.560 --> 03:47:06.560
I can just load the game again.

03:47:28.560 --> 03:47:30.560
Hmm.

03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:40.560
Hmm.

03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:44.560
I'm a mar...

03:47:44.560 --> 03:47:46.560
I'm a mario school.

03:47:58.560 --> 03:48:00.560
Hmm.

03:48:20.560 --> 03:48:22.560
Hmm.

03:48:28.560 --> 03:48:30.560
Quality time.

03:48:36.560 --> 03:48:38.560
Quality time?

03:48:38.560 --> 03:48:40.560
I don't know.

03:48:58.560 --> 03:49:00.560
Who's first name escapes me?

03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:26.560
Who's first name escapes me?

03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:30.560
I hear there's an honorary plaque

03:49:30.560 --> 03:49:32.560
commemorating him

03:49:32.560 --> 03:49:34.560
within the lodge.

03:49:34.560 --> 03:49:36.560
Lodge?

03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:37.560
Big guy.

03:49:37.560 --> 03:49:39.560
Boring some quality time.

03:49:39.560 --> 03:49:42.560
The greatest gift I can bestow upon you

03:49:42.560 --> 03:49:44.560
as your former principal

03:49:44.560 --> 03:49:46.560
is a word of advice.

03:49:46.560 --> 03:49:48.560
Join the order

03:49:48.560 --> 03:49:50.560
of the harvest moon at any cost.

03:49:50.560 --> 03:49:52.560
Within the lodge

03:49:52.560 --> 03:49:54.560
lies your future.

03:49:54.560 --> 03:49:56.560
And without

03:49:56.560 --> 03:49:58.560
dust.

03:50:02.560 --> 03:50:04.560
Why do you keep calling me big guy?

03:50:04.560 --> 03:50:06.560
They sign of respect, lad.

03:50:06.560 --> 03:50:08.560
As principal, my station is higher

03:50:08.560 --> 03:50:10.560
than yours now.

03:50:10.560 --> 03:50:12.560
But you never know what the future holds.

03:50:12.560 --> 03:50:14.560
So you should always hedge your bets

03:50:14.560 --> 03:50:16.560
and pay tribute

03:50:16.560 --> 03:50:18.560
to your inferiors.

03:50:18.560 --> 03:50:20.560
You know who will come to power.

03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:22.560
Inferiors? Oh.

03:50:22.560 --> 03:50:24.560
Even now, wheels sit behind the scenes.

03:50:24.560 --> 03:50:26.560
For all I know, you might already be a member

03:50:26.560 --> 03:50:28.560
of the order with access

03:50:28.560 --> 03:50:30.560
to the lodge.

03:50:30.560 --> 03:50:32.560
If that were the case, you'd be my superior

03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:34.560
and I'd be all that much better off

03:50:34.560 --> 03:50:36.560
having shown you respect

03:50:36.560 --> 03:50:38.560
and spent some quality

03:50:38.560 --> 03:50:40.560
time with you.

03:50:42.560 --> 03:50:44.560
Quality time?

03:50:54.560 --> 03:50:56.560
Myself, I tip a discipline

03:50:56.560 --> 03:50:58.560
with love.

03:50:58.560 --> 03:51:00.560
Oh, love!

03:51:00.560 --> 03:51:02.560
Love can be such a warm

03:51:02.560 --> 03:51:04.560
sharing experience.

03:51:04.560 --> 03:51:06.560
After just a few sessions,

03:51:06.560 --> 03:51:08.560
you'd stop this amnesia nonsense

03:51:08.560 --> 03:51:10.560
and become a productive

03:51:10.560 --> 03:51:12.560
member of society.

03:51:12.560 --> 03:51:14.560
Oh, love!

03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:18.560
Okay.

03:51:18.560 --> 03:51:20.560
Big guy,

03:51:20.560 --> 03:51:22.560
boring some quality time.

03:51:24.560 --> 03:51:26.560
Drop in again soon.

03:51:26.560 --> 03:51:28.560
Adult education is

03:51:28.560 --> 03:51:30.560
a wonderful thing

03:51:30.560 --> 03:51:32.560
as is adult quality

03:51:32.560 --> 03:51:34.560
time.

03:51:34.560 --> 03:51:36.560
I want some quality time.

03:51:36.560 --> 03:51:38.560
Last protected fire alarm.

03:51:38.560 --> 03:51:40.560
Will not let you use

03:51:40.560 --> 03:51:42.560
the fire alarm.

03:51:42.560 --> 03:51:44.560
Drinking fountain doesn't work.

03:51:48.560 --> 03:51:50.560
These lockers are riddled with inexplicable

03:51:50.560 --> 03:51:52.560
stains and dent.

03:51:52.560 --> 03:51:54.560
Door is locked.

03:51:54.560 --> 03:51:56.560
Uh-huh.

03:52:04.560 --> 03:52:06.560
The children look stunned and zombified.

03:52:10.560 --> 03:52:12.560
Even the paper cutouts look stunned

03:52:12.560 --> 03:52:14.560
and zombified.

03:52:14.560 --> 03:52:16.560
Oh, I don't need to go back in.

03:52:16.560 --> 03:52:18.560
My goodness.

03:52:18.560 --> 03:52:20.560
Class, this is Steven.

03:52:20.560 --> 03:52:22.560
He used to be a student

03:52:22.560 --> 03:52:24.560
here at Gean Memorial.

03:52:24.560 --> 03:52:26.560
Say hello, class.

03:52:26.560 --> 03:52:28.560
They're reticent.

03:52:28.560 --> 03:52:30.560
The educator's greatest problem

03:52:30.560 --> 03:52:32.560
today is the apathy of the students.

03:52:32.560 --> 03:52:34.560
What's wrong with there?

03:52:34.560 --> 03:52:36.560
It.

03:52:36.560 --> 03:52:38.560
I can tell you in one word, Steven.

03:52:38.560 --> 03:52:40.560
Discipline.

03:52:40.560 --> 03:52:42.560
Goodness, you weren't a sulky bear.

03:52:42.560 --> 03:52:44.560
You were always a smiley bear.

03:52:44.560 --> 03:52:46.560
Then...

03:52:46.560 --> 03:52:48.560
You remember me?

03:52:48.560 --> 03:52:50.560
Not as such.

03:52:50.560 --> 03:52:52.560
So many pupils, Steven.

03:52:52.560 --> 03:52:54.560
They come and they go.

03:52:54.560 --> 03:52:56.560
But I can always spot those who are nice boys.

03:52:56.560 --> 03:52:58.560
You can tell from the forehead.

03:52:58.560 --> 03:53:00.560
The lobes, right, class?

03:53:00.560 --> 03:53:02.560
I'm glad you stopped by, Steven.

03:53:02.560 --> 03:53:04.560
Would you care to say a few words to the class

03:53:04.560 --> 03:53:06.560
about civic responsibility?

03:53:06.560 --> 03:53:08.560
Not really.

03:53:08.560 --> 03:53:10.560
I was just passing through.

03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:12.560
But you must, Steven.

03:53:12.560 --> 03:53:14.560
A positive role model might be just the thing

03:53:14.560 --> 03:53:16.560
to inspire these little monsters.

03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:18.560
Steven, have you any questions for me?

03:53:18.560 --> 03:53:20.560
Or shall I continue with class?

03:53:22.560 --> 03:53:24.560
Yes, I do.

03:53:26.560 --> 03:53:28.560
Harvest.

03:53:28.560 --> 03:53:30.560
You tell me anything about the harvest.

03:53:30.560 --> 03:53:32.560
Harvest was founded by the order

03:53:32.560 --> 03:53:34.560
of the Harvest Moon about 100 years ago.

03:53:34.560 --> 03:53:36.560
For what purpose?

03:53:36.560 --> 03:53:38.560
Why, I'm sure you'd have to ask them.

03:53:38.560 --> 03:53:40.560
You'll find the members of the order at the lodge.

03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:42.560
Dang!

03:53:42.560 --> 03:53:44.560
Uh...

03:53:44.560 --> 03:53:46.560
Lodge.

03:54:04.560 --> 03:54:06.560
Why is everyone so...

03:54:06.560 --> 03:54:08.560
Okay!

03:54:08.560 --> 03:54:10.560
And at some point, should I wait?

03:54:20.560 --> 03:54:22.560
A baseball bat!

03:54:38.560 --> 03:54:40.560
If an A-bomb hits,

03:54:40.560 --> 03:54:42.560
what good is it going to do

03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:44.560
to duck and cover?

03:54:52.560 --> 03:54:54.560
Okay, that's fine.

03:54:54.560 --> 03:54:56.560
Okay, that's fine.

03:55:14.560 --> 03:55:16.560
Is this why...

03:55:16.560 --> 03:55:18.560
Yeah, is this why we had memory loss?

03:55:24.560 --> 03:55:26.560
I was like, oh, this is fine!

03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:28.560
And then I saw the blood and I was like,

03:55:28.560 --> 03:55:30.560
this is not fine anymore.

03:55:30.560 --> 03:55:32.560
Don't buy any time, Steven.

03:55:34.560 --> 03:55:36.560
Okay.

03:55:36.560 --> 03:55:38.560
So you don't get to look

03:55:38.560 --> 03:55:40.560
at what the kids look like? Okay.

03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:46.560
Okay.

03:55:46.560 --> 03:55:48.560
Where else did I not go yet?

03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:50.560
Shad's...

03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:52.560
Shady, sorry.

03:55:52.560 --> 03:55:54.560
I was reading it wrong.

03:55:54.560 --> 03:55:56.560
Shady...

03:55:56.560 --> 03:55:58.560
I was reading it wrong.

03:55:58.560 --> 03:56:00.560
Shady...

03:56:00.560 --> 03:56:02.560
Shady...

03:56:02.560 --> 03:56:04.560
Shady...

03:56:04.560 --> 03:56:06.560
Shady...

03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:08.560
Shady...

03:56:08.560 --> 03:56:10.560
Shady...

03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:12.560
Shady...

03:56:12.560 --> 03:56:14.560
Shady...

03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:16.560
I was reading it wrong. Shady...

03:56:16.560 --> 03:56:18.560
Memorial?

03:56:18.560 --> 03:56:20.560
Those volts of candles

03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:22.560
have been lit by many well-wishers

03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:24.560
for the dead or well-wishers

03:56:24.560 --> 03:56:26.560
with a lot of matches.

03:56:26.560 --> 03:56:28.560
Those geared to us

03:56:28.560 --> 03:56:30.560
who have passed recently.

03:56:30.560 --> 03:56:32.560
Jonathan A. Reigncliff.

03:56:32.560 --> 03:56:34.560
Kedro for this week's funerary event.

03:56:34.560 --> 03:56:36.560
I mean, this is an okay place

03:56:36.560 --> 03:56:38.560
to have the wedding.

03:56:40.560 --> 03:56:42.560
Oh!

03:56:44.560 --> 03:56:46.560
It counters this new tube of astraglue.

03:56:54.560 --> 03:56:56.560
I wanted it.

03:56:56.560 --> 03:56:58.560
Security.

03:56:58.560 --> 03:57:00.560
Like what? Money?

03:57:00.560 --> 03:57:02.560
I'm afraid that's not good enough.

03:57:02.560 --> 03:57:04.560
I need that glue for my work.

03:57:04.560 --> 03:57:06.560
You must present me with something

03:57:06.560 --> 03:57:08.560
significant if you'd have me

03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:10.560
part with it.

03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:12.560
Like tampons?

03:57:12.560 --> 03:57:14.560
I am Daniel Moynihan.

03:57:14.560 --> 03:57:16.560
Mortician and proprietor

03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:18.560
of the wayward hotel.

03:57:18.560 --> 03:57:20.560
Most people ask me why I don't

03:57:20.560 --> 03:57:22.560
remember their names.

03:57:22.560 --> 03:57:24.560
Well, you always were a kidder.

03:57:24.560 --> 03:57:26.560
Another kidder!

03:57:54.560 --> 03:57:56.560
What losses?

03:58:00.560 --> 03:58:02.560
Ah, not the PTA.

03:58:24.560 --> 03:58:26.560
Okay, that sounds suspicious.

03:58:44.560 --> 03:58:46.560
Okay.

03:58:48.560 --> 03:58:50.560
Oh, Order of the Harvest Moon?

03:58:50.560 --> 03:58:52.560
You're a part of it, isn't it?

03:58:54.560 --> 03:58:56.560
Mm-hmm.

03:59:04.560 --> 03:59:06.560
Mm-hmm.

03:59:12.560 --> 03:59:14.560
Thank you, Cole. Hi for housing us in the basement.

03:59:16.560 --> 03:59:18.560
Do they work at the meat plant?

03:59:18.560 --> 03:59:20.560
I always said small animals, right?

03:59:24.560 --> 03:59:26.560
Yeah.

03:59:46.560 --> 03:59:48.560
When they ran out of cats.

03:59:48.560 --> 03:59:50.560
There was a lot of cats there.

03:59:50.560 --> 03:59:52.560
A bake sale?

03:59:54.560 --> 03:59:56.560
Oh wait, I already said that.

04:00:00.560 --> 04:00:02.560
Losses?

04:00:20.560 --> 04:00:22.560
The dead?

04:00:50.560 --> 04:00:52.560
That's why I put some supplies in barrels.

04:01:16.560 --> 04:01:18.560
Wayward Hotel.

04:01:20.560 --> 04:01:22.560
I do my best to accommodate any hobo

04:01:22.560 --> 04:01:24.560
who straggles into town vacancies permitting.

04:01:30.560 --> 04:01:32.560
Very charitable of you.

04:01:32.560 --> 04:01:34.560
Thank you.

04:01:48.560 --> 04:01:50.560
Can I talk about the Wayward Hotel again?

04:01:54.560 --> 04:01:56.560
Are the guys who dropped dead staying at your hotel?

04:02:02.560 --> 04:02:04.560
I can't remember every little

04:02:04.560 --> 04:02:06.560
Is he lying?

04:02:12.560 --> 04:02:14.560
Why is everyone saying juicy?

04:02:28.560 --> 04:02:30.560
Bye.

04:02:32.560 --> 04:02:34.560
I look

04:02:40.560 --> 04:02:42.560
Very nasty-looking sink.

04:02:42.560 --> 04:02:44.560
The fan-wearing blades barely stir the stench-laden air.

04:02:48.560 --> 04:02:50.560
The needle lies on 33 degrees Fahrenheit.

04:02:54.560 --> 04:02:56.560
This membered organ,

04:02:56.560 --> 04:02:58.560
which was never meant to pump a meldehyde.

04:02:58.560 --> 04:03:00.560
Is there anything else in here?

04:03:14.560 --> 04:03:16.560
Alright, this isn't salty at all.

04:03:16.560 --> 04:03:18.560
A lectern for a priest.

04:03:18.560 --> 04:03:20.560
A hauntingly beautiful stained glass window

04:03:20.560 --> 04:03:22.560
in which a man holds a scythe

04:03:22.560 --> 04:03:24.560
in one hand and some ethereal power in the other.

04:03:28.560 --> 04:03:30.560
A saint kneels before a shepherd.

04:03:30.560 --> 04:03:32.560
You jubilantly terrified.

04:03:36.560 --> 04:03:38.560
Is there like a secret thing here?

04:03:46.560 --> 04:03:48.560
We are in a cult

04:03:48.560 --> 04:03:50.560
and it's probably run by

04:03:50.560 --> 04:03:52.560
evil people.

04:03:54.560 --> 04:03:56.560
Cemetery.

04:03:58.560 --> 04:04:00.560
I guess we go in.

04:04:04.560 --> 04:04:06.560
The headstone of this grave

04:04:06.560 --> 04:04:08.560
site reads Jonathan

04:04:08.560 --> 04:04:10.560
Jonathan A. Ryan Co-

04:04:10.560 --> 04:04:12.560
Let's save.

04:04:28.560 --> 04:04:30.560
Here lies Boxcar Willie.

04:04:32.560 --> 04:04:34.560
Air reeks of fresh soil manure.

04:04:36.560 --> 04:04:38.560
Two years in harvest was

04:04:38.560 --> 04:04:40.560
Two years in harvest was too long.

04:04:40.560 --> 04:04:42.560
Fear not in death.

04:04:42.560 --> 04:04:44.560
Montages.

04:04:44.560 --> 04:04:46.560
Scripture in the headstone has faded.

04:04:48.560 --> 04:04:50.560
November 27th, 1948.

04:04:50.560 --> 04:04:52.560
Another unknown visitor.

04:04:52.560 --> 04:04:54.560
This tombstone is unmarked.

04:04:58.560 --> 04:05:00.560
You don't know how to use a shovel.

04:05:02.560 --> 04:05:04.560
Another resting place amongst

04:05:04.560 --> 04:05:06.560
the graves.

04:05:12.560 --> 04:05:14.560
What's here?

04:05:14.560 --> 04:05:16.560
Marvel store have been sealed shut.

04:05:22.560 --> 04:05:24.560
I don't know.

04:05:30.560 --> 04:05:32.560
Wrong grave?

04:05:36.560 --> 04:05:38.560
Well, that didn't work.

04:05:38.560 --> 04:05:40.560
Okay.

04:05:40.560 --> 04:05:42.560
Never mind then.

04:05:42.560 --> 04:05:44.560
Is there anything else?

04:05:50.560 --> 04:05:52.560
Is there anything else?

04:05:54.560 --> 04:05:56.560
Maybe the diner?

04:05:56.560 --> 04:05:58.560
Anything in the diner?

04:06:12.560 --> 04:06:14.560
Anything in the diner?

04:06:22.560 --> 04:06:24.560
Oh, it's just me, right?

04:06:24.560 --> 04:06:26.560
And

04:06:26.560 --> 04:06:28.560
does not let her customers

04:06:28.560 --> 04:06:30.560
behind the counter.

04:06:32.560 --> 04:06:34.560
Bye, bye.

04:06:34.560 --> 04:06:36.560
Okay, that's a little eerie.

04:06:36.560 --> 04:06:38.560
Mr. Johnson's house.

04:06:38.560 --> 04:06:40.560
Johnson?

04:06:54.560 --> 04:06:56.560
Oh, right here.

04:07:24.560 --> 04:07:26.560
Oh, okay.

04:07:32.560 --> 04:07:34.560
Okay.

04:07:36.560 --> 04:07:38.560
Kidder count.

04:07:54.560 --> 04:07:56.560
Okay, Edna.

04:08:00.560 --> 04:08:02.560
What?

04:08:24.560 --> 04:08:26.560
She needs a good, hard pain.

04:08:26.560 --> 04:08:28.560
What?

04:08:36.560 --> 04:08:38.560
I can see why she doesn't like you.

04:08:40.560 --> 04:08:42.560
I see why she doesn't like you.

04:08:42.560 --> 04:08:44.560
You're not in this for love.

04:08:44.560 --> 04:08:46.560
You're in this for other things.

04:08:46.560 --> 04:08:48.560
How dare you?

04:08:54.560 --> 04:08:56.560
I...

04:09:02.560 --> 04:09:04.560
No, he's not in this for love.

04:09:04.560 --> 04:09:06.560
I can tell.

04:09:06.560 --> 04:09:08.560
After all, some pies are here because they're in love, right?

04:09:10.560 --> 04:09:12.560
Well, tell me more about the diner.

04:09:24.560 --> 04:09:26.560
Okay.

04:09:40.560 --> 04:09:42.560
Okay, a little bit of whiplash there.

04:09:48.560 --> 04:09:50.560
That's a little bit of whiplash there.

04:09:50.560 --> 04:09:52.560
How Stephanie?

04:09:52.560 --> 04:09:54.560
Oh, yeah, she's fine.

04:09:56.560 --> 04:09:58.560
Can't we want both things?

04:09:58.560 --> 04:10:00.560
Of course we can want both things.

04:10:00.560 --> 04:10:02.560
But you have to want both things.

04:10:02.560 --> 04:10:04.560
You can't just have...

04:10:04.560 --> 04:10:06.560
the other thing.

04:10:06.560 --> 04:10:08.560
Because without love, it's meaningless, right?

04:10:14.560 --> 04:10:16.560
Speaking of Stephanie,

04:10:16.560 --> 04:10:18.560
I still haven't gotten an invitation to the wedding yet.

04:10:18.560 --> 04:10:20.560
I don't have anything to do with that.

04:10:22.560 --> 04:10:24.560
That's okay.

04:10:24.560 --> 04:10:26.560
Personally, I'd prefer a pass to the honeymoon.

04:10:28.560 --> 04:10:30.560
A pass?

04:10:30.560 --> 04:10:32.560
I could use the backseat of my tucker for the

04:10:32.560 --> 04:10:34.560
maiden voyage.

04:10:34.560 --> 04:10:36.560
It's plenty big.

04:10:36.560 --> 04:10:38.560
Believe you me.

04:10:38.560 --> 04:10:40.560
I'd drive you around.

04:10:40.560 --> 04:10:42.560
And I wouldn't look in the backseat.

04:10:42.560 --> 04:10:44.560
I guarantee it.

04:10:44.560 --> 04:10:46.560
Though, if you'd like to come up front

04:10:46.560 --> 04:10:48.560
and take the wheel a while,

04:10:48.560 --> 04:10:50.560
I wouldn't say name.

04:10:50.560 --> 04:10:52.560
Mimosa!

04:10:54.560 --> 04:10:56.560
Also, this man is not allowed

04:10:56.560 --> 04:10:58.560
at our honeymoon!

04:11:00.560 --> 04:11:02.560
Mimosa!

04:11:02.560 --> 04:11:04.560
Welcome to the stream!

04:11:04.560 --> 04:11:06.560
Welcome!

04:11:08.560 --> 04:11:10.560
No, but no.

04:11:10.560 --> 04:11:12.560
I don't want anyone at our honeymoon Senpai.

04:11:12.560 --> 04:11:14.560
Our honeymoon is very lovely

04:11:14.560 --> 04:11:16.560
and romantic, okay?

04:11:16.560 --> 04:11:18.560
This...

04:11:18.560 --> 04:11:20.560
That is not romantic!

04:11:20.560 --> 04:11:22.560
Mimosa, welcome to the stream!

04:11:22.560 --> 04:11:24.560
Welcome!

04:11:24.560 --> 04:11:26.560
Hello, Raiders!

04:11:26.560 --> 04:11:28.560
My name is

04:11:28.560 --> 04:11:30.560
Mercy Modis

04:11:30.560 --> 04:11:32.560
from Gen 1...

04:11:32.560 --> 04:11:34.560
No, from

04:11:34.560 --> 04:11:36.560
Viewers! Gen 1

04:11:36.560 --> 04:11:38.560
Indulge! Welcome!

04:11:38.560 --> 04:11:40.560
Right now, we are playing!

04:11:44.560 --> 04:11:46.560
I'm sorry.

04:11:46.560 --> 04:11:48.560
I blanked out on the name for a second.

04:11:48.560 --> 04:11:50.560
Welcome, Mimosa!

04:11:50.560 --> 04:11:52.560
How was the stream?

04:11:52.560 --> 04:11:54.560
What were you playing?

04:12:00.560 --> 04:12:02.560
Sorry, I totally forgot.

04:12:02.560 --> 04:12:04.560
I blanked out on the name.

04:12:04.560 --> 04:12:06.560
No, I don't want to be...

04:12:06.560 --> 04:12:08.560
Our honeymoon can't be here!

04:12:08.560 --> 04:12:10.560
I remember playing that game.

04:12:10.560 --> 04:12:12.560
I remember playing

04:12:12.560 --> 04:12:14.560
Bunny Garden. It was real...

04:12:14.560 --> 04:12:16.560
It was real fun. Did you like it?

04:12:16.560 --> 04:12:18.560
Are you liking it?

04:12:22.560 --> 04:12:24.560
I forgot the order

04:12:24.560 --> 04:12:26.560
which I had to do it.

04:12:26.560 --> 04:12:28.560
Welcome, welcome! There might be some

04:12:28.560 --> 04:12:30.560
such things in this game, so

04:12:30.560 --> 04:12:32.560
if you're not into the such stuff

04:12:32.560 --> 04:12:34.560
maybe close your ears.

04:12:34.560 --> 04:12:36.560
Thank you, Mimosa!

04:12:36.560 --> 04:12:38.560
I hope you had a good one. Are you heading to bed?

04:12:42.560 --> 04:12:44.560
I saw a girl with green lace panties.

04:12:44.560 --> 04:12:46.560
It was amazing.

04:12:46.560 --> 04:12:48.560
Wait, I played a different Bunny Game!

04:12:48.560 --> 04:12:50.560
Bunny Garden Game!

04:12:50.560 --> 04:12:52.560
This one's the new one!

04:12:52.560 --> 04:12:54.560
With the Bunny! Bunny Girls!

04:12:54.560 --> 04:12:56.560
Real Bunny Girls!

04:12:56.560 --> 04:12:58.560
Not anthropomorphic

04:12:58.560 --> 04:13:00.560
Bunny Girls!

04:13:00.560 --> 04:13:02.560
Like, you know...

04:13:02.560 --> 04:13:04.560
Sexy Bunny Girls!

04:13:12.560 --> 04:13:14.560
Huh?

04:13:20.560 --> 04:13:22.560
Right? This one's the sexy one!

04:13:22.560 --> 04:13:24.560
And you can gamble!

04:13:24.560 --> 04:13:26.560
Right? This is the new one, right?

04:13:26.560 --> 04:13:28.560
This is the one.

04:13:28.560 --> 04:13:30.560
The other one's like Bunny Bunny!

04:13:30.560 --> 04:13:32.560
Am I...

04:13:32.560 --> 04:13:34.560
I thought it was Bunny Garden.

04:13:34.560 --> 04:13:36.560
Was it called something else?

04:13:38.560 --> 04:13:40.560
No, no, no!

04:13:40.560 --> 04:13:42.560
Uh...

04:13:44.560 --> 04:13:46.560
Give me a second. Bunny Garden...

04:13:52.560 --> 04:13:54.560
Sorry, I mistaken the name!

04:13:54.560 --> 04:13:56.560
Sorry, sorry, sorry! I mistaken the name!

04:13:56.560 --> 04:13:58.560
The game I was playing was called

04:13:58.560 --> 04:14:00.560
the Bunny Graveyard!

04:14:02.560 --> 04:14:04.560
There was a bit of gardening in it!

04:14:10.560 --> 04:14:12.560
Ha ha ha ha!

04:14:14.560 --> 04:14:16.560
Ha ha ha ha!

04:14:18.560 --> 04:14:20.560
There's a different location!

04:14:20.560 --> 04:14:22.560
We did garden!

04:14:22.560 --> 04:14:24.560
We did garden in there!

04:14:28.560 --> 04:14:30.560
Graveyard Garden!

04:14:30.560 --> 04:14:32.560
Same difference! They have dirt in them!

04:14:32.560 --> 04:14:34.560
You know?

04:14:38.560 --> 04:14:40.560
The same!

04:14:40.560 --> 04:14:42.560
You still talked about sexy anthropomorphic bunnies!

04:14:42.560 --> 04:14:44.560
Oh, no, no, no!

04:14:44.560 --> 04:14:46.560
I meant like this one is anthropomorphic bunnies!

04:14:46.560 --> 04:14:48.560
Bunny Garden, the other one,

04:14:48.560 --> 04:14:50.560
is sexy bunnies!

04:14:50.560 --> 04:14:52.560
Like Playboy bunnies!

04:14:52.560 --> 04:14:54.560
But we don't say Playboy because we can get sued!

04:14:54.560 --> 04:14:56.560
Ha ha ha ha!

04:15:02.560 --> 04:15:04.560
But nice! Green panties!

04:15:04.560 --> 04:15:06.560
I don't even think I have green panties!

04:15:06.560 --> 04:15:08.560
What color are my panties?

04:15:10.560 --> 04:15:12.560
No, they're bears! I forgot!

04:15:12.560 --> 04:15:14.560
Yeah, they're bears! Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:15:18.560 --> 04:15:20.560
Mercy, you kill me!

04:15:20.560 --> 04:15:22.560
No...

04:15:22.560 --> 04:15:24.560
No...

04:15:24.560 --> 04:15:26.560
No...

04:15:26.560 --> 04:15:28.560
Because Mimosa...

04:15:28.560 --> 04:15:30.560
You slay!

04:15:30.560 --> 04:15:32.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:15:32.560 --> 04:15:34.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:15:50.560 --> 04:15:52.560
Ah!

04:15:52.560 --> 04:15:54.560
Look at me! Look at me, senpais!

04:15:54.560 --> 04:15:56.560
I have ribs!

04:15:56.560 --> 04:15:58.560
Right? I have ribs!

04:16:00.560 --> 04:16:02.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:16:04.560 --> 04:16:06.560
Okay...

04:16:06.560 --> 04:16:08.560
Don't...

04:16:08.560 --> 04:16:10.560
Don't point out how long I've been wearing the same panties

04:16:10.560 --> 04:16:12.560
for a doll!

04:16:12.560 --> 04:16:14.560
Why are you keeping track anyways, huh?

04:16:16.560 --> 04:16:18.560
We're gonna...

04:16:18.560 --> 04:16:20.560
Shut up!

04:16:22.560 --> 04:16:24.560
Yeah, I got the ribs!

04:16:24.560 --> 04:16:26.560
So now...

04:16:26.560 --> 04:16:28.560
Clearly!

04:16:28.560 --> 04:16:30.560
Clearly, Mimosa

04:16:30.560 --> 04:16:32.560
wants to be my best friend forever, right?

04:16:32.560 --> 04:16:34.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:16:36.560 --> 04:16:38.560
Well, you did say you hadn't

04:16:38.560 --> 04:16:40.560
showered in days openly.

04:16:40.560 --> 04:16:42.560
Well, my water's not exactly

04:16:42.560 --> 04:16:44.560
in...

04:16:44.560 --> 04:16:46.560
proper condition.

04:16:46.560 --> 04:16:48.560
And it was just yesterday!

04:16:48.560 --> 04:16:50.560
I showered yesterday! It's fine!

04:16:50.560 --> 04:16:52.560
I think...

04:16:52.560 --> 04:16:54.560
Actually...

04:16:58.560 --> 04:17:00.560
Call me!

04:17:02.560 --> 04:17:04.560
Mimosa!

04:17:04.560 --> 04:17:06.560
You can slide into my DMs

04:17:06.560 --> 04:17:08.560
anytime, don't worry.

04:17:12.560 --> 04:17:14.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:17:16.560 --> 04:17:18.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:17:20.560 --> 04:17:22.560
Listen, girls!

04:17:22.560 --> 04:17:24.560
The... the corporal girls, they don't...

04:17:24.560 --> 04:17:26.560
They don't have...

04:17:26.560 --> 04:17:28.560
They don't get to go in the cage. They have...

04:17:28.560 --> 04:17:30.560
free access.

04:17:30.560 --> 04:17:32.560
Oh, they don't have to stay.

04:17:32.560 --> 04:17:34.560
They can stay if they want.

04:17:34.560 --> 04:17:36.560
They have free access to come and go as they please.

04:17:36.560 --> 04:17:38.560
Yeah.

04:17:38.560 --> 04:17:40.560
Yeah.

04:17:40.560 --> 04:17:42.560
Mm-hmm.

04:17:42.560 --> 04:17:44.560
I can't believe there is work.

04:17:44.560 --> 04:17:46.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:17:46.560 --> 04:17:48.560
Discrimination!

04:17:48.560 --> 04:17:50.560
Don't get me wrong, Senpai!

04:17:50.560 --> 04:17:52.560
Don't get me wrong!

04:17:52.560 --> 04:17:54.560
It's not like I don't trust you,

04:17:54.560 --> 04:17:56.560
but there's many times

04:17:56.560 --> 04:17:58.560
in which I question the validity

04:17:58.560 --> 04:18:00.560
of your words.

04:18:00.560 --> 04:18:02.560
So that's why sometimes

04:18:02.560 --> 04:18:04.560
the girls help me.

04:18:04.560 --> 04:18:06.560
And then they help me clean up as well.

04:18:06.560 --> 04:18:08.560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:18:14.560 --> 04:18:16.560
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

04:18:20.560 --> 04:18:22.560
Remember

04:18:22.560 --> 04:18:24.560
when you didn't put

04:18:24.560 --> 04:18:26.560
my Oshi mark in your name, Senpai?

04:18:28.560 --> 04:18:30.560
Remember when you said

04:18:30.560 --> 04:18:32.560
that you didn't love me?

04:18:32.560 --> 04:18:34.560
There's so many moments like that,

04:18:34.560 --> 04:18:36.560
and I always give second chances.

04:18:36.560 --> 04:18:38.560
More than checking chances.

04:18:38.560 --> 04:18:40.560
At this point, it seems to be like

04:18:40.560 --> 04:18:42.560
my endless amount of chances.

04:18:42.560 --> 04:18:44.560
I'm so nice!

04:18:48.560 --> 04:18:50.560
I'm so nice!

04:18:50.560 --> 04:18:52.560
And all this time,

04:18:52.560 --> 04:18:54.560
what do I get?

04:18:54.560 --> 04:18:56.560
Not even my Oshi mark in your name.

04:19:00.560 --> 04:19:02.560
I am so nice.

04:19:02.560 --> 04:19:04.560
I give you a television in your cage.

04:19:04.560 --> 04:19:06.560
I give you one happy meal

04:19:06.560 --> 04:19:08.560
to share with everyone.

04:19:10.560 --> 04:19:12.560
I give you five minutes of free time

04:19:12.560 --> 04:19:14.560
so you even get to have some

04:19:14.560 --> 04:19:16.560
some fun in there.

04:19:16.560 --> 04:19:18.560
Come on!

04:19:20.560 --> 04:19:22.560
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

04:19:24.560 --> 04:19:26.560
So, Senpai's.

04:19:28.560 --> 04:19:30.560
Senpai, Senpai's.

04:19:30.560 --> 04:19:32.560
Now that you have it,

04:19:32.560 --> 04:19:34.560
you have to earn my trust again.

04:19:34.560 --> 04:19:36.560
You have to earn my trust again.

04:19:36.560 --> 04:19:38.560
Because if I see you next day

04:19:38.560 --> 04:19:40.560
without my Oshi mark,

04:19:40.560 --> 04:19:42.560
we're going to have a lot of serious talking.

04:19:42.560 --> 04:19:44.560
And by serious talking, I mean

04:19:44.560 --> 04:19:46.560
perhaps talking where

04:19:46.560 --> 04:19:48.560
you are met by the end of a shovel.

04:19:48.560 --> 04:19:50.560
The spade side.

04:19:54.560 --> 04:19:56.560
All right.

04:20:00.560 --> 04:20:02.560
All right.

04:20:08.560 --> 04:20:10.560
So that's all.

04:20:10.560 --> 04:20:12.560
No ifs, and buts, and besides.

04:20:12.560 --> 04:20:14.560
Besides.

04:20:14.560 --> 04:20:16.560
The girls know how to keep a secret.

04:20:18.560 --> 04:20:20.560
And, okay.

04:20:20.560 --> 04:20:22.560
And, and

04:20:22.560 --> 04:20:24.560
the cage

04:20:24.560 --> 04:20:26.560
and the basement is my place

04:20:26.560 --> 04:20:28.560
and your place, okay?

04:20:28.560 --> 04:20:30.560
It's our private sanctuary.

04:20:30.560 --> 04:20:32.560
It's our private sanctuary.

04:20:32.560 --> 04:20:34.560
I mean we'll also come for visits of course

04:20:34.560 --> 04:20:36.560
but otherwise, it's our private sanctuary.

04:20:38.560 --> 04:20:40.560
All right.

04:20:40.560 --> 04:20:42.560
Okay.

04:20:52.560 --> 04:20:54.560
It's our private sanctuary.

04:20:54.560 --> 04:20:56.560
Although if mimosa wants to be called Senpai

04:20:56.560 --> 04:20:58.560
then you know

04:20:58.560 --> 04:21:00.560
she would have

04:21:00.560 --> 04:21:02.560
to share the McDonald's meal too.

04:21:02.560 --> 04:21:04.560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

04:21:10.560 --> 04:21:13.880
And then we'll have a wedding all together!

04:21:13.880 --> 04:21:15.560
Hahahahaha!

04:21:15.560 --> 04:21:17.560
No!

04:21:17.560 --> 04:21:20.560
Then special privileges it is.

04:21:22.560 --> 04:21:24.560
It's tomorrow Happy Meal Day or Monday.

04:21:24.560 --> 04:21:28.560
It's once a month and I've already given the Happy Meal.

04:21:28.560 --> 04:21:31.560
Anyways, let's continue on this.

04:21:31.560 --> 04:21:34.560
I don't want to know but we're going to ask about Tucker.

04:21:37.560 --> 04:21:39.560
Heck of an automobile, isn't she?

04:21:40.560 --> 04:21:45.560
Damn shame I have to sit out here and watch over her all the time.

04:21:45.560 --> 04:21:50.560
But if I didn't, those stupid kids might scratch her up playing ball.

04:21:55.560 --> 04:21:57.560
Can I take a look at it?

04:22:11.560 --> 04:22:16.560
A few months back someone broke into my house, trying to get into the garage.

04:22:16.560 --> 04:22:23.560
I had to gripe my car before the sheriff agreed to start the evening patrols and instigate the curfew.

04:22:40.560 --> 04:23:02.560
Only 51 cars were made, including their prototype, before the company was forced to declare bankruptcy and cease all operations on March 3, 1949 due to negative publicity initiated by the news media.

04:23:03.560 --> 04:23:04.560
Let's see.

04:23:04.560 --> 04:23:13.560
A Securities Exchange Commission investigation heavily publicized stock fraud trial in which the allegations for proven baseless and led to full acquittal.

04:23:13.560 --> 04:23:23.560
Tucker suspected that big three automakers, Mexican Senator Homer S. Ferguson had a role in the Tucker corporation's demise.

04:23:24.560 --> 04:23:27.560
So what, they didn't like the car or something?

04:23:28.560 --> 04:23:37.560
Alright, okay, so I guess this car is really rare and that's why it's expensive? Okay.

04:23:39.560 --> 04:23:42.560
I mean, that's why he cares about it so much, got it.

04:23:47.560 --> 04:23:48.560
Why now?

04:23:49.560 --> 04:23:55.560
During the day, Mr. Johnson keeps watch over his precious 48 Tucker.

04:23:58.560 --> 04:24:07.560
Sorry, Steve. Too tired to talk right now. I just gave the Tucker a tune up. I'll talk to you later.

04:24:08.560 --> 04:24:09.560
Okay, bye.

04:24:14.560 --> 04:24:16.560
Okay, so this is an expensive car.

04:24:20.560 --> 04:24:23.560
Or, well, a car that's very...

04:24:24.560 --> 04:24:25.560
Am I missing something?

04:24:25.560 --> 04:24:28.560
Where do I get a screwdriver, some pie?

04:24:28.560 --> 04:24:29.560
Pie.

04:24:48.560 --> 04:24:57.560
It's during the day he sits out there, but when he goes to the diner, is the car, you know, car?

04:24:59.560 --> 04:25:03.560
A screwdriver store, shut up.

04:25:16.560 --> 04:25:17.560
Does my house have one?

04:25:29.560 --> 04:25:34.560
I won't be able to get the screwdriver today or tomorrow.

04:25:36.560 --> 04:25:37.560
But why not?

04:25:41.560 --> 04:25:42.560
Why not?

04:25:44.560 --> 04:25:46.560
You want this autograph?

04:25:49.560 --> 04:25:51.560
Actually, never mind. You're a brat.

04:25:59.560 --> 04:26:00.560
You're a brat.

04:26:14.560 --> 04:26:15.560
Big whoopsie.

04:26:16.560 --> 04:26:17.560
Never mind.

04:26:25.560 --> 04:26:26.560
I guess?

04:26:29.560 --> 04:26:34.560
Yeah, me didn't fucking care.

04:26:35.560 --> 04:26:36.560
I guess?

04:26:37.560 --> 04:26:39.560
Did I write out the completed lodge?

04:26:43.560 --> 04:26:44.560
I guess?

04:26:45.560 --> 04:26:51.560
If I'm done everything, I can go to the lodge and be like, here you go!

04:26:52.560 --> 04:26:53.560
Right?

04:26:59.560 --> 04:27:00.560
Oh, where is it?

04:27:06.560 --> 04:27:08.560
Oh, right. Wrong game.

04:27:10.560 --> 04:27:11.560
Here you go.

04:27:16.560 --> 04:27:17.560
Yeah.

04:27:28.560 --> 04:27:29.560
Assignment.

04:27:32.560 --> 04:27:34.560
Oh, am I done for the day?

04:27:41.560 --> 04:27:45.560
Look at the graphics, must have been like super great back then.

04:27:53.560 --> 04:27:55.560
Why are you taking off your shirt, Steve?

04:27:58.560 --> 04:28:03.560
Put on a shirt, you're gonna catch it cold.

04:28:05.560 --> 04:28:08.560
That voice will always be hilarious.

04:28:09.560 --> 04:28:12.560
Oh, yeah. Is this funny, Jill?

04:28:14.560 --> 04:28:15.560
What's going on here?

04:28:24.560 --> 04:28:25.560
Burger?

04:28:28.560 --> 04:28:30.560
What's going on here?

04:28:53.560 --> 04:28:55.560
I was like there was just a burger there.

04:28:55.560 --> 04:28:58.560
Anything that's suddenly in my thingy?

04:29:05.560 --> 04:29:08.560
Obviously some fat high school girl left it here.

04:29:08.560 --> 04:29:09.560
What the...

04:29:11.560 --> 04:29:12.560
Dipper dolls.

04:29:14.560 --> 04:29:15.560
Anything else?

04:29:15.560 --> 04:29:16.560
No.

04:29:19.560 --> 04:29:21.560
What do you want, Steve?

04:29:23.560 --> 04:29:24.560
Still sick, huh?

04:29:26.560 --> 04:29:27.560
Alright.

04:29:34.560 --> 04:29:35.560
You wanna go?

04:29:38.560 --> 04:29:40.560
You wanna go, little bro?

04:29:46.560 --> 04:29:47.560
Okay, dad.

04:29:51.560 --> 04:29:53.560
Is he feeling better?

04:29:55.560 --> 04:29:59.560
You know what? Fuck you.

04:30:01.560 --> 04:30:02.560
Goodbye.

04:30:03.560 --> 04:30:05.560
Aw, man, I wanna kick Kim in.

04:30:10.560 --> 04:30:11.560
newborn baby.

04:30:17.560 --> 04:30:18.560
Dad?

04:30:18.560 --> 04:30:19.560
Dad?

04:30:29.560 --> 04:30:30.560
Is there anything else?

04:30:31.560 --> 04:30:33.560
Cookies? More cookies.

04:30:39.560 --> 04:30:41.560
You forgot to have fun with mom yesterday.

04:30:43.560 --> 04:30:44.560
So...

04:30:48.560 --> 04:30:51.560
You want me to fuck mom?

04:30:52.560 --> 04:30:55.560
Is that what you're saying? To do my ma'am?

04:30:59.560 --> 04:31:01.560
I think I got a paper yesterday.

04:31:09.560 --> 04:31:11.560
I think I have a paper from yesterday.

04:31:12.560 --> 04:31:15.560
Yeah, I have a paper from yesterday.

04:31:15.560 --> 04:31:18.560
Oh, hi. What? The game loves you!

04:31:21.560 --> 04:31:23.560
See, she's like naughty words.

04:31:23.560 --> 04:31:26.560
So I just put in a lot of naughty words, okay? Here.

04:31:30.560 --> 04:31:31.560
See?

04:31:31.560 --> 04:31:33.560
And not me! The game says it.

04:31:45.560 --> 04:31:50.560
See? See, it's not me! The game says so.

04:32:01.560 --> 04:32:04.560
Okay, hold on. I got your paper, boy.

04:32:05.560 --> 04:32:07.560
There now. See how easy it is?

04:32:08.560 --> 04:32:12.560
Things are so much better between us when you remember the paper in the morning.

04:32:12.560 --> 04:32:14.560
And let's keep it that way.

04:32:14.560 --> 04:32:17.560
I feel like this kid's gonna grab a gun at me or something.

04:32:17.560 --> 04:32:19.560
Or stab me.

04:32:28.560 --> 04:32:30.560
I didn't think that would happen.

04:32:32.560 --> 04:32:35.560
I didn't think it would happen, but it did!

04:32:41.560 --> 04:32:43.560
I knew it!

04:32:44.560 --> 04:32:46.560
I knew it was strapped!

04:32:48.560 --> 04:32:50.560
I knew it!

04:32:53.560 --> 04:32:55.560
I knew it!

04:33:05.560 --> 04:33:07.560
I knew it!

04:33:10.560 --> 04:33:13.560
Can I punch him to death though? Is that a possibility?

04:33:15.560 --> 04:33:18.560
I don't want to do this, but...

04:33:21.560 --> 04:33:23.560
No, okay. It's only an outside thing.

04:33:27.560 --> 04:33:30.560
It's possible, but very difficult.

04:33:37.560 --> 04:33:40.560
It's just a really long time of punching.

04:33:40.560 --> 04:33:42.560
The kid didn't even hesitate!

04:33:44.560 --> 04:33:47.560
Can I kill the kid myself?

04:33:50.560 --> 04:33:53.560
Whatever. We're gonna play a friendly relation for now.

04:33:53.560 --> 04:33:55.560
For now.

04:34:03.560 --> 04:34:07.560
Hey Steve, you've been doing a swell job putting the paper out in the morning.

04:34:07.560 --> 04:34:11.560
You just keep doing that and we won't have any problems.

04:34:11.560 --> 04:34:14.560
Yeah, yeah, whatever kid.

04:34:19.560 --> 04:34:22.560
Where should I go to first? The lodge, right?

04:34:31.560 --> 04:34:33.560
Yeah, I guess.

04:34:34.560 --> 04:34:36.560
Yeah, I want to know what you know.

04:34:42.560 --> 04:34:44.560
Okay.

04:34:52.560 --> 04:34:54.560
Yeah, what kind of tasks?

04:34:54.560 --> 04:34:56.560
Minor pranks!

04:35:11.560 --> 04:35:15.560
There is, in harvest, a man named Mr. Johnson.

04:35:15.560 --> 04:35:20.560
He owns a Tucker. It is his pride and joy.

04:35:20.560 --> 04:35:24.560
I should like you to put a scratch in it.

04:35:24.560 --> 04:35:26.560
A scratch? That's all?

04:35:26.560 --> 04:35:29.560
As I said, a minor prank.

04:35:29.560 --> 04:35:33.560
Mind you, you're not to damage the vehicle.

04:35:33.560 --> 04:35:36.560
Really put a single scratch in it.

04:35:36.560 --> 04:35:39.560
Once you have done so, return here.

04:35:39.560 --> 04:35:43.560
And I shall give you your next task.

04:35:43.560 --> 04:35:46.560
Okay, so I put a scratch on it.

04:35:54.560 --> 04:35:56.560
Okay.

04:36:02.560 --> 04:36:04.560
Do I...

04:36:05.560 --> 04:36:07.560
What do I do? Okay.

04:36:08.560 --> 04:36:11.560
If I do it right in front of him, he'll fucking kill me, right?

04:36:11.560 --> 04:36:13.560
That's my guess.

04:36:16.560 --> 04:36:18.560
What if...

04:36:18.560 --> 04:36:21.560
What if I even use the scratch?

04:36:21.560 --> 04:36:23.560
Shawty.

04:36:24.560 --> 04:36:26.560
I want this.

04:36:28.560 --> 04:36:30.560
I don't have money.

04:36:31.560 --> 04:36:33.560
Hello, Steve. Care to buy anything?

04:36:33.560 --> 04:36:35.560
No, thanks.

04:36:37.560 --> 04:36:39.560
I'll be happy to help you.

04:36:39.560 --> 04:36:41.560
Okay, thank you.

04:36:44.560 --> 04:36:46.560
Oh, do I key a car?

04:36:48.560 --> 04:36:50.560
Where can I get a key?

04:37:01.560 --> 04:37:04.560
Maybe with the screwdriver? Where do I get the screwdriver?

04:37:07.560 --> 04:37:09.560
Is he here?

04:37:09.560 --> 04:37:11.560
He's not here.

04:37:28.560 --> 04:37:30.560
Newspaper building.

04:37:30.560 --> 04:37:32.560
Newspaper building.

04:37:36.560 --> 04:37:38.560
Check the old man's garage.

04:37:39.560 --> 04:37:41.560
This guy?

04:37:45.560 --> 04:37:47.560
Sorry, Steve.

04:37:48.560 --> 04:37:50.560
Bye now.

04:37:54.560 --> 04:37:57.560
Can I go into his house?

04:38:00.560 --> 04:38:02.560
Ew, okay.

04:38:04.560 --> 04:38:06.560
I wonder if Stephanie has anything to say.

04:38:06.560 --> 04:38:08.560
Oh, you're right.

04:38:08.560 --> 04:38:10.560
I totally forgot about Stephanie.

04:38:10.560 --> 04:38:13.560
I forgot! We have a wedding!

04:38:18.560 --> 04:38:21.560
Yes, I... No, I haven't seen him.

04:38:30.560 --> 04:38:32.560
Aw.

04:38:40.560 --> 04:38:42.560
Aw.

04:38:42.560 --> 04:38:44.560
Wait, no, I shouldn't say aww.

04:38:44.560 --> 04:38:46.560
You, you, you are dirty!

04:38:50.560 --> 04:38:52.560
Okay.

04:38:52.560 --> 04:38:54.560
But also, fuck you.

04:38:54.560 --> 04:38:56.560
Not like in...

04:38:56.560 --> 04:38:58.560
You forgot about your wife? Sure did.

04:38:58.560 --> 04:39:00.560
You moved the people?

04:39:06.560 --> 04:39:08.560
He didn't move the people!

04:39:16.560 --> 04:39:18.560
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

04:39:18.560 --> 04:39:21.560
What did I say about the fucking people, huh?

04:39:22.560 --> 04:39:24.560
You little shit.

04:39:25.560 --> 04:39:29.560
I gave you one thing, and you didn't even do it!

04:39:29.560 --> 04:39:31.560
Are you peeping caught?

04:39:31.560 --> 04:39:34.560
Listen, I wanted to check if it was still there.

04:39:34.560 --> 04:39:36.560
I wanted to check if it was still there.

04:39:39.560 --> 04:39:42.560
Steve, I'm so glad you came back.

04:39:42.560 --> 04:39:44.560
What have you been doing?

04:39:44.560 --> 04:39:46.560
I visited the lodge.

04:39:46.560 --> 04:39:48.560
Talked to the sergeant at arms there.

04:39:49.560 --> 04:39:51.560
He knows that there's something out of whack here.

04:39:51.560 --> 04:39:55.560
He told me if I wanted to find out what it is, I should join the lodge.

04:39:55.560 --> 04:39:58.560
I've decided to join the lodge, Stephanie.

04:39:58.560 --> 04:40:01.560
I think the answer to all our questions is inside.

04:40:01.560 --> 04:40:03.560
That place.

04:40:03.560 --> 04:40:05.560
It's so sinister.

04:40:07.560 --> 04:40:09.560
Maybe, but I've got to join anyways.

04:40:09.560 --> 04:40:11.560
You may be playing right into their hands.

04:40:11.560 --> 04:40:13.560
Did you think of that?

04:40:13.560 --> 04:40:16.560
Doesn't it seem like you're being hurted toward the lodge?

04:40:16.560 --> 04:40:19.560
It's one of the things I hope to find out.

04:40:19.560 --> 04:40:22.560
I hope finding out doesn't get you killed.

04:40:24.560 --> 04:40:26.560
Come back and visit me soon.

04:40:26.560 --> 04:40:28.560
Okay?

04:40:28.560 --> 04:40:30.560
Okay.

04:40:35.560 --> 04:40:37.560
Oi, that peephole!

04:40:39.560 --> 04:40:41.560
Hole!

04:40:49.560 --> 04:40:51.560
I guess.

04:40:57.560 --> 04:40:59.560
Hmm.

04:41:03.560 --> 04:41:06.560
You might want to be extra nice to Mr. Potson today.

04:41:06.560 --> 04:41:09.560
Guess we're having a wedding at Mr. Moynihan's after all.

04:41:11.560 --> 04:41:13.560
Give my regards to your parents.

04:41:13.560 --> 04:41:15.560
Hmm.

04:41:16.560 --> 04:41:17.560
You!

04:41:17.560 --> 04:41:19.560
Hole!

04:41:21.560 --> 04:41:23.560
My garage needs a new paint job.

04:41:33.560 --> 04:41:35.560
I need a key. Where do I get a key?

04:41:35.560 --> 04:41:37.560
I need a key.

04:41:44.560 --> 04:41:49.560
Kittle, you brought me any of them girly picture books?

04:41:49.560 --> 04:41:51.560
No, sorry.

04:41:51.560 --> 04:41:53.560
Oh heck.

04:41:53.560 --> 04:41:59.560
Why should you be any different from the sheriff or Mrs. Loomis?

04:42:00.560 --> 04:42:08.560
Dave, I'd be right obliged if you could just seek Claire to bring in me just one of them books.

04:42:08.560 --> 04:42:10.560
Believe me.

04:42:10.560 --> 04:42:12.560
I already got your book!

04:42:12.560 --> 04:42:16.560
I already got your one! What happened to the last one?

04:42:19.560 --> 04:42:22.560
Wait, you're just going to let me look at it?

04:42:23.560 --> 04:42:25.560
Can I do that again?

04:42:26.560 --> 04:42:28.560
It just lets me?

04:42:35.560 --> 04:42:37.560
It just lets me now?

04:42:43.560 --> 04:42:45.560
Alright.

04:42:45.560 --> 04:42:50.560
I'm a little nervous about it, but I guess it just does.

04:42:56.560 --> 04:43:00.560
Alright, just don't mind me, officer.

04:43:00.560 --> 04:43:03.560
I'm just going in.

04:43:06.560 --> 04:43:09.560
I thought you were going to be burnt down already.

04:43:15.560 --> 04:43:16.560
Bye.

04:43:26.560 --> 04:43:31.560
Anything to stretch the car?

04:43:31.560 --> 04:43:33.560
Have a shovel.

04:43:48.560 --> 04:43:50.560
What's this?

04:43:50.560 --> 04:43:54.560
A manhole key is stuck on the top of the manhole cover.

04:43:54.560 --> 04:43:56.560
Can I take that?

04:44:07.560 --> 04:44:09.560
Okay, bye.

04:44:18.560 --> 04:44:23.560
Could you use the shovel and the manhole key? Why would I use the shovel and the manhole key?

04:44:23.560 --> 04:44:25.560
Well, that didn't work.

04:44:29.560 --> 04:44:32.560
Anything I can get to get it?

04:44:34.560 --> 04:44:36.560
A lube.

04:44:46.560 --> 04:44:49.560
Wait, was that not enough lube?

04:44:50.560 --> 04:44:52.560
Oh, thank you.

04:44:53.560 --> 04:44:55.560
Thank you.

04:45:03.560 --> 04:45:06.560
Wait, what do you mean I thought it sense?

04:45:12.560 --> 04:45:14.560
Wait, what?

04:45:14.560 --> 04:45:16.560
Was that the game?

04:45:23.560 --> 04:45:26.560
I do remember there's...

04:45:26.560 --> 04:45:29.560
Oh, that seems dangerous. Hold on.

04:45:29.560 --> 04:45:31.560
Let's grab this.

04:45:48.560 --> 04:45:51.560
Was that all I had to do today?

04:45:53.560 --> 04:45:55.560
Okay.

04:45:59.560 --> 04:46:02.560
The rest of the grate is bolted to the damp floor.

04:46:02.560 --> 04:46:06.560
Cold and moisture has formed along the surface of the wheel valve.

04:46:06.560 --> 04:46:08.560
Can I use it?

04:46:12.560 --> 04:46:14.560
What about this?

04:46:14.560 --> 04:46:17.560
Small section of the hull has been resealed due to the water damage.

04:46:23.560 --> 04:46:25.560
What about this?

04:46:29.560 --> 04:46:31.560
Bolted.

04:46:32.560 --> 04:46:34.560
Well, that didn't work.

04:46:34.560 --> 04:46:36.560
Oh, man. Well, that didn't work.

04:46:36.560 --> 04:46:38.560
Damn it.

04:46:39.560 --> 04:46:41.560
What do I do now?

04:46:48.560 --> 04:46:50.560
Is that just to go back up?

04:46:50.560 --> 04:46:52.560
Okay.

04:47:04.560 --> 04:47:07.560
Does that mean I have the brake in again?

04:47:11.560 --> 04:47:13.560
Oh, man.

04:47:21.560 --> 04:47:23.560
What do I need?

04:47:23.560 --> 04:47:25.560
What do I need?

04:47:29.560 --> 04:47:31.560
The walls down here?

04:47:33.560 --> 04:47:36.560
Oh, there's a tiny indentation in the concrete.

04:47:39.560 --> 04:47:41.560
Can I use the shovel?

04:47:51.560 --> 04:47:53.560
Never mind, we got it.

04:47:58.560 --> 04:48:00.560
Wow, wow!

04:48:03.560 --> 04:48:06.560
Empty oil can slither before.

04:48:07.560 --> 04:48:11.560
A large oil pan filled with lugs and bolts.

04:48:15.560 --> 04:48:17.560
Oh.

04:48:17.560 --> 04:48:19.560
Okay.

04:48:20.560 --> 04:48:22.560
What's down here?

04:48:30.560 --> 04:48:33.560
Mr. Johnson has a myriad of goodies on his tool bench.

04:48:33.560 --> 04:48:35.560
Can I grab some?

04:48:38.560 --> 04:48:40.560
Flashlight missing batteries.

04:48:41.560 --> 04:48:45.560
Gas can similar to the model to the Postmaster's gas can.

04:48:46.560 --> 04:48:48.560
Rubber mallet.

04:48:49.560 --> 04:48:51.560
Ain't nothing but sawdust.

04:48:51.560 --> 04:48:53.560
I was hoping he'd have a screwdriver.

04:48:53.560 --> 04:48:55.560
Ducca ducca ducca ducca.

04:48:56.560 --> 04:48:58.560
Oh, wait. No.

04:48:58.560 --> 04:49:00.560
There it is.

04:49:16.560 --> 04:49:18.560
Is there anything else here?

04:49:21.560 --> 04:49:23.560
The edge to the side of the blowtorch reads,

04:49:23.560 --> 04:49:25.560
Thinking of you, Edna.

04:49:27.560 --> 04:49:29.560
How do I scratch this car?

04:49:29.560 --> 04:49:32.560
Do I scratch it with the screwdriver?

04:49:32.560 --> 04:49:34.560
Did it.

04:49:34.560 --> 04:49:36.560
Get the fuck out of here.

04:50:03.560 --> 04:50:05.560
Wait, can I cover the manhole?

04:50:08.560 --> 04:50:10.560
Can I cover the manhole again?

04:50:12.560 --> 04:50:14.560
Ah, man. Ah, man.

04:50:15.560 --> 04:50:17.560
Yeah.

04:50:17.560 --> 04:50:19.560
Fuck out of here.

04:50:20.560 --> 04:50:22.560
Guess we go back to the lodge.

04:50:26.560 --> 04:50:30.560
So, you have completed your first task.

04:50:30.560 --> 04:50:32.560
Peace.

04:50:32.560 --> 04:50:34.560
Now that you've scratched the ducca,

04:50:34.560 --> 04:50:37.560
you may proceed to your second task.

04:50:37.560 --> 04:50:41.560
You will steal a bolt of fabric from the fireman,

04:50:41.560 --> 04:50:44.560
and bring it to me.

04:50:50.560 --> 04:50:53.560
I see, then the lodge is comprised of thieves.

04:50:53.560 --> 04:50:58.560
The human mind always seeks to categorize phenomena.

04:50:59.560 --> 04:51:00.560
Okay.

04:51:00.560 --> 04:51:02.560
Uh-huh.

04:51:02.560 --> 04:51:04.560
Uh-huh.

04:51:29.560 --> 04:51:31.560
Meet again, huh?

04:51:49.560 --> 04:51:52.560
Okay, I guess it's my day over?

04:51:54.560 --> 04:51:56.560
Right, he talks a lot.

04:51:56.560 --> 04:51:58.560
I guess we have to get the mob now.

04:51:59.560 --> 04:52:01.560
Oh, I like the fireman's.

04:52:04.560 --> 04:52:05.560
Well, that was fast.

04:52:05.560 --> 04:52:07.560
I saw that faster than I thought.

04:52:17.560 --> 04:52:19.560
Way faster than I thought, actually.

04:52:27.560 --> 04:52:31.560
I just don't know why he's always got to be shirtless.

04:52:34.560 --> 04:52:38.560
Does he go to bed with his watch on to use some pie?

04:52:40.560 --> 04:52:43.560
I have, like, a kamigachi watch.

04:52:51.560 --> 04:52:52.560
Oh, you're right.

04:52:52.560 --> 04:52:54.560
He sleeps in jeans.

04:52:55.560 --> 04:52:58.560
Many people would sleep with their Apple Watches nowadays

04:52:58.560 --> 04:53:00.560
because the tracks sleep.

04:53:01.560 --> 04:53:03.560
That's a bit luxurious for me.

04:53:03.560 --> 04:53:06.560
Taddle shoes with laces knotted together.

04:53:06.560 --> 04:53:08.560
Taddle shoes.

04:53:09.560 --> 04:53:10.560
What's that?

04:53:10.560 --> 04:53:11.560
I don't know.

04:53:11.560 --> 04:53:12.560
I don't know.

04:53:12.560 --> 04:53:13.560
I don't know.

04:53:13.560 --> 04:53:14.560
I don't know.

04:53:14.560 --> 04:53:15.560
I don't know.

04:53:15.560 --> 04:53:16.560
I don't know.

04:53:16.560 --> 04:53:17.560
I don't know.

04:53:17.560 --> 04:53:18.560
I don't know.

04:53:18.560 --> 04:53:19.560
I don't know.

04:53:19.560 --> 04:53:20.560
I don't know.

04:53:20.560 --> 04:53:21.560
I don't know.

04:53:22.560 --> 04:53:23.560
What's that?

04:53:24.560 --> 04:53:26.560
Recently watered plastic plant.

04:53:33.560 --> 04:53:34.560
Gotta get a paper.

04:53:36.560 --> 04:53:37.560
Don't leave without it.

04:53:37.560 --> 04:53:39.560
I said, don't leave without it.

04:53:39.560 --> 04:53:40.560
Let's talk to your brother.

04:53:41.560 --> 04:53:43.560
The dad feeling better?

04:53:51.560 --> 04:53:53.560
Pot holder on her knees.

04:53:53.560 --> 04:53:54.560
Reaching for him.

04:53:54.560 --> 04:53:57.560
How can she do the stitches on him wearing those?

04:53:57.560 --> 04:53:59.560
Wouldn't she slip?

04:53:59.560 --> 04:54:00.560
Don't be silly.

04:54:00.560 --> 04:54:01.560
She wouldn't do that.

04:54:01.560 --> 04:54:02.560
Of course she'd slip.

04:54:02.560 --> 04:54:04.560
Maybe that's why he's not getting better.

04:54:04.560 --> 04:54:06.560
I heard that someone took Karen.

04:54:06.560 --> 04:54:09.560
Little Miss Perfect was famous.

04:54:09.560 --> 04:54:12.560
Gonna do a picture on her milk carton.

04:54:12.560 --> 04:54:13.560
Yeah.

04:54:13.560 --> 04:54:15.560
Well, I heard that Karen was gone.

04:54:15.560 --> 04:54:18.560
So I went over to Miss Fitzgerald's house

04:54:18.560 --> 04:54:21.560
and asked if I could play with Karen.

04:54:23.560 --> 04:54:27.560
And I just stood there, you know, in the doorway

04:54:27.560 --> 04:54:30.560
and cried and cried.

04:54:30.560 --> 04:54:32.560
And I just stood there.

04:54:32.560 --> 04:54:34.560
Punch my brother.

04:54:34.560 --> 04:54:36.560
I don't know what take for her to stop.

04:54:36.560 --> 04:54:38.560
But she didn't.

04:54:40.560 --> 04:54:42.560
So I went inside and watched TV

04:54:42.560 --> 04:54:44.560
because they've got color.

04:54:44.560 --> 04:54:46.560
I thought you said you never heard of color.

04:54:46.560 --> 04:54:49.560
Because she runs the diner and all.

04:54:49.560 --> 04:54:52.560
And I've said she was feeling vulnerable.

04:54:52.560 --> 04:54:56.560
So I asked her to fix me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

04:54:56.560 --> 04:54:57.560
And she...

04:54:57.560 --> 04:54:58.560
I'm gonna kill this kid.

04:54:58.560 --> 04:55:00.560
Then I went into Karen's bedroom

04:55:00.560 --> 04:55:02.560
and looked around for stuff I could take

04:55:02.560 --> 04:55:05.560
while Edna was in the bathroom with the water running.

04:55:05.560 --> 04:55:06.560
What?

04:55:06.560 --> 04:55:09.560
But all that there was was pearl stuff.

04:55:09.560 --> 04:55:11.560
So I came home.

04:55:11.560 --> 04:55:14.560
But it was fun while it lasted.

04:55:16.560 --> 04:55:18.560
You're evil.

04:55:26.560 --> 04:55:28.560
Why is my brother off track?

04:55:34.560 --> 04:55:36.560
Gosh, I wanna punch you.

04:55:36.560 --> 04:55:39.560
Why can't I go over there and punch him myself?

04:55:47.560 --> 04:55:49.560
Oops.

04:55:55.560 --> 04:55:56.560
What?

04:56:03.560 --> 04:56:05.560
What day did she disappear?

04:56:10.560 --> 04:56:11.560
Tuesday.

04:56:11.560 --> 04:56:12.560
Okay.

04:56:17.560 --> 04:56:20.560
Wait, have I checked on my little sister yet?

04:56:20.560 --> 04:56:22.560
Is my little sister even real?

04:56:29.560 --> 04:56:31.560
What is wrong with that kid?

04:56:31.560 --> 04:56:33.560
I hate kids.

04:56:41.560 --> 04:56:43.560
Hold on.

04:56:47.560 --> 04:56:48.560
What? Why?

04:56:48.560 --> 04:56:50.560
Yeah, I did. Why?

04:56:52.560 --> 04:56:54.560
What are we training?

04:57:09.560 --> 04:57:11.560
Okay, sure. Take the sneakers.

04:57:16.560 --> 04:57:18.560
Okay.

04:57:31.560 --> 04:57:33.560
Don't you need the paper?

04:57:33.560 --> 04:57:34.560
Paper?

04:57:44.560 --> 04:57:45.560
Okay, you wanna go save Karen?

04:57:45.560 --> 04:57:47.560
Yeah, I wanna go save Karen.

04:57:47.560 --> 04:57:49.560
She seems like a sweet girl.

04:57:50.560 --> 04:57:52.560
Wait a second.

04:57:52.560 --> 04:57:55.560
Oh, so when did he talk about...

04:57:55.560 --> 04:57:57.560
Okay, hold on.

04:57:57.560 --> 04:57:59.560
Let's grab this.

04:58:04.560 --> 04:58:07.560
Like, most security devices there

04:58:07.560 --> 04:58:10.560
is usually more than one trap to stop intruders.

04:58:10.560 --> 04:58:13.560
No!

04:58:13.560 --> 04:58:15.560
When did I save?

04:58:17.560 --> 04:58:19.560
What was the last time I saved?

04:58:30.560 --> 04:58:32.560
Shit!

04:58:34.560 --> 04:58:37.560
This is your first arrest, Steve.

04:58:43.560 --> 04:58:45.560
Aw, man.

04:58:58.560 --> 04:59:01.560
Next time I gotta save more.

04:59:04.560 --> 04:59:07.560
Oh! It led me all the way here!

04:59:09.560 --> 04:59:11.560
Son of a bitch.

04:59:33.560 --> 04:59:35.560
Give me... Give me...

04:59:35.560 --> 04:59:37.560
Right, go through the...

04:59:40.560 --> 04:59:42.560
Wait a second.

04:59:43.560 --> 04:59:45.560
A dependent poster?

04:59:45.560 --> 04:59:49.560
Aided poster is a 1948 Sexiest Tomboy Award.

04:59:49.560 --> 04:59:51.560
Tomboy, huh?

04:59:57.560 --> 04:59:59.560
Did it.

05:00:03.560 --> 05:00:05.560
No, no.

05:00:29.560 --> 05:00:31.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:00:31.560 --> 05:00:34.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, you know what? Now we save again.

05:00:42.200 --> 05:00:43.320
Oh my gosh.

05:00:53.000 --> 05:00:59.640
Some pies. Are you saying that you like tomboy? Am I not tomboy enough for you?

05:01:02.520 --> 05:01:03.560
More of you.

05:01:05.560 --> 05:01:07.560
I hear tomboy.

05:01:07.560 --> 05:01:09.560
I hear you.

05:01:11.560 --> 05:01:13.560
Then I...

05:01:13.560 --> 05:01:15.560
Uh-huh.

05:01:15.560 --> 05:01:17.560
Mom says...

05:01:17.560 --> 05:01:19.560
Good.

05:01:19.560 --> 05:01:21.560
Oh, you go back here. Talk to mom again.

05:01:21.560 --> 05:01:23.560
Hello, dear. By the way, it is...

05:01:25.560 --> 05:01:27.560
This happened.

05:01:27.560 --> 05:01:29.560
Don't forget to put...

05:01:47.560 --> 05:01:49.560
Hmm, okay.

05:01:49.560 --> 05:01:51.560
Now I talk to him.

05:01:51.560 --> 05:01:53.560
Hey, did you...

05:01:53.560 --> 05:01:55.560
Yes, I did.

05:01:55.560 --> 05:01:57.560
You know this...

05:01:57.560 --> 05:01:59.560
Take the sneakers.

05:01:59.560 --> 05:02:01.560
Swirl.

05:02:01.560 --> 05:02:03.560
And also the paper.

05:02:11.560 --> 05:02:13.560
How do I get the alarm out then?

05:02:17.560 --> 05:02:19.560
Hmm...

05:02:19.560 --> 05:02:21.560
What's my definition of a tomboy?

05:02:35.560 --> 05:02:37.560
Masculine traits?

05:02:49.560 --> 05:02:51.560
Huh.

05:02:53.560 --> 05:02:55.560
Okay.

05:02:55.560 --> 05:02:57.560
How do we save her?

05:02:57.560 --> 05:02:59.560
How do I... Fuck.

05:03:11.560 --> 05:03:15.560
The alarm is in the living room, but your brother's a jerk.

05:03:15.560 --> 05:03:17.560
I can try to get rid of that.

05:03:19.560 --> 05:03:21.560
Oh, my God.

05:03:21.560 --> 05:03:23.560
I want to kill him.

05:03:49.560 --> 05:03:51.560
Where did she go?

05:03:51.560 --> 05:03:53.560
I can't stop and chat, Steve.

05:03:53.560 --> 05:03:55.560
With Karen gone, if I stop, I think I'll lose my mind.

05:03:55.560 --> 05:03:57.560
I've got to keep busy.

05:03:57.560 --> 05:03:59.560
Busy.

05:03:59.560 --> 05:04:01.560
Excuse me.

05:04:01.560 --> 05:04:03.560
I just heard that Mr. Johnson's tucker was vandalized.

05:04:03.560 --> 05:04:05.560
You know, though I don't like to think ill of people

05:04:05.560 --> 05:04:07.560
or take pleasure in the misfortunes of others.

05:04:07.560 --> 05:04:09.560
I'd like to think it's a comeuppance

05:04:09.560 --> 05:04:11.560
for all the people that I've met.

05:04:11.560 --> 05:04:13.560
I've got to keep busy.

05:04:13.560 --> 05:04:15.560
Busy.

05:04:15.560 --> 05:04:17.560
Excuse me.

05:04:17.560 --> 05:04:19.560
I'd like to think it's a comeuppance

05:04:19.560 --> 05:04:21.560
for all the times that nasty man has bothered me.

05:04:25.560 --> 05:04:27.560
I can't do it yet.

05:04:47.560 --> 05:04:49.560
Yeah, let's check with Stephanie.

05:05:01.560 --> 05:05:03.560
Oh, shit, wrong place.

05:05:07.560 --> 05:05:09.560
Potsdam.

05:05:09.560 --> 05:05:11.560
Did you say hello to your...

05:05:11.560 --> 05:05:13.560
No, I haven't seen him yet.

05:05:15.560 --> 05:05:17.560
His daughter, Karen, is missing.

05:05:17.560 --> 05:05:19.560
How could anyone do something so terrible to her?

05:05:19.560 --> 05:05:21.560
You think someone took her?

05:05:21.560 --> 05:05:23.560
I think.

05:05:23.560 --> 05:05:25.560
Oh, no, see, it was a kidnapping.

05:05:25.560 --> 05:05:27.560
Haven't you heard?

05:05:27.560 --> 05:05:29.560
The sheriff got a ransom note.

05:05:29.560 --> 05:05:31.560
It seems someone wants to dip into Edna's lauder.

05:05:31.560 --> 05:05:33.560
Too bad.

05:05:33.560 --> 05:05:35.560
Such a bad thing.

05:05:35.560 --> 05:05:37.560
I'm sorry.

05:05:37.560 --> 05:05:39.560
Too bad such a sweet little thing

05:05:39.560 --> 05:05:41.560
has to suffer.

05:05:43.560 --> 05:05:45.560
Where were you Tuesday night?

05:05:47.560 --> 05:05:49.560
That was a terrible night.

05:05:49.560 --> 05:05:51.560
Our upstairs toilet backed up.

05:05:51.560 --> 05:05:53.560
Pete Swell came over and fixed it.

05:05:55.560 --> 05:05:57.560
My back still soar

05:05:57.560 --> 05:05:59.560
from helping me carry his stuff up the stairs.

05:06:01.560 --> 05:06:03.560
Someone went and scraped up Johnson's car?

05:06:03.560 --> 05:06:05.560
Can you imagine?

05:06:07.560 --> 05:06:09.560
He'd step in a bear trap

05:06:09.560 --> 05:06:11.560
and chew his own leg off

05:06:11.560 --> 05:06:13.560
rather than suffer a scratch.

05:06:13.560 --> 05:06:15.560
Tucker serves the rich bastard right.

05:06:15.560 --> 05:06:17.560
Okay, we're going all over the place.

05:06:25.560 --> 05:06:27.560
Was Johnson behind the alibi?

05:06:27.560 --> 05:06:29.560
I'm gonna just ask her.

05:06:31.560 --> 05:06:33.560
Steve.

05:06:33.560 --> 05:06:35.560
I'm sorry.

05:06:35.560 --> 05:06:37.560
Want to hear what's happening out in the real world?

05:06:37.560 --> 05:06:39.560
No.

05:06:39.560 --> 05:06:41.560
I'd rather forget about Harvest for a while.

05:06:43.560 --> 05:06:45.560
Come here.

05:06:47.560 --> 05:06:49.560
What?

05:06:51.560 --> 05:06:53.560
Stephanie.

05:06:53.560 --> 05:06:55.560
I feel so close to you, Steve.

05:06:57.560 --> 05:06:59.560
Like we're the only two people in Harvest.

05:06:59.560 --> 05:07:01.560
The only two real people.

05:07:01.560 --> 05:07:03.560
Do you know what I mean?

05:07:03.560 --> 05:07:05.560
Do you know what I mean?

05:07:09.560 --> 05:07:11.560
Yes?

05:07:11.560 --> 05:07:13.560
I need to feel something again.

05:07:13.560 --> 05:07:15.560
The sense I have that I've known you.

05:07:15.560 --> 05:07:17.560
It's my only link to my past.

05:07:19.560 --> 05:07:21.560
Yeah?

05:07:21.560 --> 05:07:23.560
Maybe it's different than memory.

05:07:23.560 --> 05:07:25.560
Okay, at least they just hold hands.

05:07:25.560 --> 05:07:27.560
Yeah!

05:07:27.560 --> 05:07:29.560
I had a nervous moment.

05:07:29.560 --> 05:07:31.560
Strong feelings.

05:07:31.560 --> 05:07:33.560
I'm so emo.

05:07:33.560 --> 05:07:35.560
You would be too if you were all late.

05:07:51.560 --> 05:07:53.560
Should I?

05:07:55.560 --> 05:07:57.560
Should I do it, Chad?

05:08:01.560 --> 05:08:03.560
I mean, surprise!

05:08:09.560 --> 05:08:11.560
Then take me.

05:08:11.560 --> 05:08:13.560
Now.

05:08:21.560 --> 05:08:23.560
What?

05:08:23.560 --> 05:08:25.560
Do you have the garden?

05:08:31.560 --> 05:08:33.560
No.

05:08:53.560 --> 05:08:55.560
Are we gonna be okay?

05:09:01.560 --> 05:09:03.560
No.

05:09:07.560 --> 05:09:09.560
It's fine!

05:09:09.560 --> 05:09:11.560
Is he still in there?

05:09:17.560 --> 05:09:19.560
We're good.

05:09:19.560 --> 05:09:21.560
We're safe, I think.

05:09:23.560 --> 05:09:25.560
If it isn't my favorite son-in-law,

05:09:25.560 --> 05:09:27.560
what brings you here again?

05:09:31.560 --> 05:09:33.560
Huh?

05:09:35.560 --> 05:09:37.560
Thank you for the $3.33.

05:09:37.560 --> 05:09:39.560
Hey, Merce.

05:09:39.560 --> 05:09:41.560
For a tiny-

05:09:41.560 --> 05:09:43.560
Spiny?

05:09:43.560 --> 05:09:45.560
Spiny?

05:09:45.560 --> 05:09:47.560
Hi, Merce.

05:09:47.560 --> 05:09:49.560
I apologize, but your son-in-law must go to sleep.

05:09:49.560 --> 05:09:51.560
I'll try and watch the rest of the vlog tomorrow.

05:09:51.560 --> 05:09:53.560
Good luck with the rest of the game, Kohai.

05:09:53.560 --> 05:09:55.560
Okay, have good sleep.

05:09:55.560 --> 05:09:57.560
Thank you for tuning in.

05:09:57.560 --> 05:09:59.560
You!

05:09:59.560 --> 05:10:01.560
Yeah, whole!

05:10:11.560 --> 05:10:13.560
We spying!

05:10:17.560 --> 05:10:19.560
What about Karen again?

05:10:25.560 --> 05:10:27.560
Maybe I can talk to the mother?

05:10:29.560 --> 05:10:31.560
Hello, dear.

05:10:31.560 --> 05:10:33.560
Yes, please.

05:10:33.560 --> 05:10:35.560
She's upstairs.

05:10:35.560 --> 05:10:37.560
Have you heard that Edna's daughter, Karen,

05:10:37.560 --> 05:10:39.560
has disappeared?

05:10:39.560 --> 05:10:41.560
These things happen.

05:10:41.560 --> 05:10:43.560
We just have to deal with them step-by-step

05:10:43.560 --> 05:10:45.560
one day at a time.

05:10:51.560 --> 05:10:53.560
Man!

05:10:53.560 --> 05:10:55.560
Who told you about Karen?

05:10:59.560 --> 05:11:01.560
Why, I suppose it was Mr. Poston.

05:11:01.560 --> 05:11:03.560
Or maybe not.

05:11:03.560 --> 05:11:05.560
I can't remember.

05:11:05.560 --> 05:11:07.560
Please excuse me, Steve.

05:11:07.560 --> 05:11:09.560
You seem flustered.

05:11:09.560 --> 05:11:11.560
Not at all.

05:11:11.560 --> 05:11:13.560
Everything is fine.

05:11:13.560 --> 05:11:15.560
Hmm.

05:11:15.560 --> 05:11:17.560
Can I talk about Karen again?

05:11:17.560 --> 05:11:19.560
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

05:11:19.560 --> 05:11:21.560
Nighty-sus.

05:11:29.560 --> 05:11:33.560
Where were you Tuesday night?

05:11:37.560 --> 05:11:39.560
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

05:11:39.560 --> 05:11:41.560
Tuesday?

05:11:41.560 --> 05:11:43.560
Sorry, I didn't...

05:11:43.560 --> 05:11:45.560
I don't think nothing happens with her

05:11:45.560 --> 05:11:47.560
if you just say fuck.

05:11:47.560 --> 05:11:49.560
Sorry, I...

05:11:49.560 --> 05:11:51.560
Give my regards to your parents.

05:11:53.560 --> 05:11:55.560
Tuesday?

05:12:01.560 --> 05:12:03.560
Interesting.

05:12:11.560 --> 05:12:13.560
I might...

05:12:15.560 --> 05:12:17.560
Oh, wait.

05:12:17.560 --> 05:12:19.560
Was that a different animation?

05:12:19.560 --> 05:12:21.560
Sorry.

05:12:25.560 --> 05:12:27.560
Okay, okay.

05:12:29.560 --> 05:12:33.560
I guess I'll just have to ask alibis, right?

05:12:35.560 --> 05:12:37.560
Do I ask everyone?

05:12:37.560 --> 05:12:39.560
Stop peeping!

05:12:39.560 --> 05:12:41.560
It's a new animation!

05:12:49.560 --> 05:12:51.560
Okay, so I messed up and

05:12:51.560 --> 05:12:53.560
I didn't get mom's alibi.

05:12:53.560 --> 05:12:55.560
So...

05:12:55.560 --> 05:12:57.560
Let's go.

05:13:01.560 --> 05:13:03.560
Hello, Steve. Care to buy?

05:13:03.560 --> 05:13:05.560
Oh, thanks.

05:13:05.560 --> 05:13:07.560
Okay, dear.

05:13:07.560 --> 05:13:09.560
Come back soon.

05:13:09.560 --> 05:13:11.560
Steve, you live close to Mr. Johnson.

05:13:11.560 --> 05:13:13.560
How is he taking it?

05:13:13.560 --> 05:13:15.560
Such wanton vandalism.

05:13:15.560 --> 05:13:17.560
It just breaks my heart.

05:13:17.560 --> 05:13:19.560
I'll have to send him a nice fruit basket.

05:13:19.560 --> 05:13:21.560
Though if he wants some new paint and sealant,

05:13:21.560 --> 05:13:23.560
it'll cost him.

05:13:25.560 --> 05:13:27.560
Heavens, did you hear that Karen has disappeared?

05:13:27.560 --> 05:13:29.560
I saw her playing outside the wayward hotel

05:13:29.560 --> 05:13:31.560
on Tuesday night.

05:13:31.560 --> 05:13:33.560
The night she vanished.

05:13:33.560 --> 05:13:35.560
Did she seem upset?

05:13:35.560 --> 05:13:37.560
Wayward hotel, huh?

05:13:37.560 --> 05:13:39.560
Betsy, no.

05:13:39.560 --> 05:13:41.560
She was under adult supervision.

05:13:41.560 --> 05:13:43.560
So I didn't think anything of it.

05:13:43.560 --> 05:13:45.560
You mean Edna was with her?

05:13:45.560 --> 05:13:47.560
No, not Edna.

05:13:47.560 --> 05:13:49.560
A man.

05:13:49.560 --> 05:13:51.560
Or an inordinately large woman.

05:13:51.560 --> 05:13:53.560
Large man or woman, huh?

05:13:53.560 --> 05:13:55.560
Alright.

05:14:01.560 --> 05:14:03.560
Large man or woman?

05:14:05.560 --> 05:14:07.560
Sorry, son.

05:14:07.560 --> 05:14:09.560
No time to talk.

05:14:09.560 --> 05:14:11.560
Neither.

05:14:11.560 --> 05:14:13.560
Next time you post.

05:14:15.560 --> 05:14:17.560
Large...

05:14:17.560 --> 05:14:19.560
men...

05:14:19.560 --> 05:14:21.560
or women?

05:14:27.560 --> 05:14:29.560
Hold on.

05:14:29.560 --> 05:14:31.560
Is it...?

05:14:31.560 --> 05:14:33.560
There's...

05:14:33.560 --> 05:14:35.560
two large men...

05:14:35.560 --> 05:14:37.560
I think.

05:14:37.560 --> 05:14:39.560
That would be...

05:14:39.560 --> 05:14:41.560
Johnson...

05:14:41.560 --> 05:14:43.560
the sheriff...

05:14:45.560 --> 05:14:47.560
and...

05:14:49.560 --> 05:14:51.560
Mr. Potsdam.

05:14:55.560 --> 05:14:57.560
Think about taking some of that sighting off my hand, son.

05:14:57.560 --> 05:14:59.560
Okay.

05:14:59.560 --> 05:15:01.560
I'll cut you a nice price on it.

05:15:03.560 --> 05:15:05.560
Too bad about Edna's daughter going missing.

05:15:07.560 --> 05:15:09.560
That was a strange night.

05:15:11.560 --> 05:15:13.560
I remember that evening.

05:15:13.560 --> 05:15:15.560
The Potsdam's upstairs bathroom toilet packed up.

05:15:17.560 --> 05:15:19.560
I've seen folks upset about that stuff.

05:15:21.560 --> 05:15:23.560
But Mr. Potsdam was just...

05:15:23.560 --> 05:15:25.560
furious.

05:15:25.560 --> 05:15:27.560
Hey, they even got it downstairs.

05:15:29.560 --> 05:15:31.560
They got it downstairs, brother.

05:15:45.560 --> 05:15:47.560
I thought he was working with you!

05:15:59.560 --> 05:16:01.560
Well, that's a sure sign...

05:16:01.560 --> 05:16:03.560
that civilization is coming to an end.

05:16:11.560 --> 05:16:13.560
I don't think it was aliens.

05:16:25.560 --> 05:16:27.560
Uh...

05:16:27.560 --> 05:16:29.560
I don't want to hear about Tuesday.

05:16:41.560 --> 05:16:43.560
Lights in a cemetery.

05:16:49.560 --> 05:16:51.560
Give me a second.

05:16:53.560 --> 05:16:55.560
I want to see the note they got at the police station.

05:16:57.560 --> 05:16:59.560
Boy,

05:16:59.560 --> 05:17:01.560
the way you keep pestering me,

05:17:01.560 --> 05:17:03.560
you'd think you were feeling guilty about something.

05:17:03.560 --> 05:17:05.560
Are you?

05:17:05.560 --> 05:17:07.560
I understand you witnessed Ms. Whaley's

05:17:07.560 --> 05:17:09.560
dispensing a little discipline at the school.

05:17:09.560 --> 05:17:11.560
And she thinks you may be

05:17:11.560 --> 05:17:13.560
feeling a mite bent about it.

05:17:17.560 --> 05:17:19.560
Am I in my own business, Sheriff?

05:17:19.560 --> 05:17:21.560
That's always the wisest course, boy.

05:17:23.560 --> 05:17:25.560
Sticking your nose where it doesn't belong

05:17:25.560 --> 05:17:27.560
can get you in a world of trouble.

05:17:27.560 --> 05:17:29.560
Especially if you're a gynecologist.

05:17:31.560 --> 05:17:33.560
Heck, there isn't a psychiatrist

05:17:33.560 --> 05:17:35.560
around who disagree about

05:17:35.560 --> 05:17:37.560
what a calm and influential

05:17:37.560 --> 05:17:39.560
dent in the head.

05:17:39.560 --> 05:17:41.560
Calm and influential?

05:17:41.560 --> 05:17:43.560
If you argue with science, Steve,

05:17:43.560 --> 05:17:45.560
it's bigger than all of us.

05:17:45.560 --> 05:17:47.560
I got a report here that someone

05:17:47.560 --> 05:17:49.560
put a ding on Johnson's tucker.

05:17:51.560 --> 05:17:53.560
As honoured as Johnson is about

05:17:53.560 --> 05:17:55.560
that old car, I suppose

05:17:55.560 --> 05:17:57.560
he had it coming.

05:17:57.560 --> 05:17:59.560
I imagine it was just some kids pulling a prank.

05:17:59.560 --> 05:18:01.560
I suppose you've

05:18:01.560 --> 05:18:03.560
heard the news about Edna's daughter, Karen,

05:18:03.560 --> 05:18:05.560
disappearing.

05:18:07.560 --> 05:18:09.560
What should I say?

05:18:09.560 --> 05:18:11.560
Yes, I'm very concerned.

05:18:11.560 --> 05:18:13.560
Or no,

05:18:13.560 --> 05:18:15.560
Karen vanished?

05:18:15.560 --> 05:18:17.560
What should I say?

05:18:17.560 --> 05:18:19.560
One?

05:18:23.560 --> 05:18:25.560
Okay.

05:18:29.560 --> 05:18:31.560
I wouldn't think about it too much

05:18:31.560 --> 05:18:33.560
if I were you.

05:18:33.560 --> 05:18:35.560
This is a serious crime.

05:18:35.560 --> 05:18:37.560
And this is no time for civilians

05:18:37.560 --> 05:18:39.560
to be nosing around playing cops and robbers.

05:18:41.560 --> 05:18:43.560
What about civic responsibility?

05:18:43.560 --> 05:18:45.560
Steve,

05:18:45.560 --> 05:18:47.560
I'd give this advice to my own son

05:18:47.560 --> 05:18:49.560
if I had one.

05:18:49.560 --> 05:18:51.560
Leave this be.

05:18:51.560 --> 05:18:53.560
This is not the kind of thing you should look into.

05:18:53.560 --> 05:18:55.560
I'm being paid off.

05:18:55.560 --> 05:18:57.560
So some wild oats, boy.

05:18:57.560 --> 05:18:59.560
Kick up your heels.

05:18:59.560 --> 05:19:01.560
Join the lodge.

05:19:01.560 --> 05:19:03.560
Join the lodge, Steve.

05:19:03.560 --> 05:19:05.560
And leave Karen to the professionals.

05:19:07.560 --> 05:19:09.560
Stop on by any time.

05:19:09.560 --> 05:19:11.560
No, no, no.

05:19:11.560 --> 05:19:13.560
Hold on.

05:19:15.560 --> 05:19:17.560
I'm sorry.

05:19:17.560 --> 05:19:19.560
I don't feel a...

05:19:19.560 --> 05:19:21.560
any time.

05:19:25.560 --> 05:19:27.560
Where's the note?

05:19:27.560 --> 05:19:29.560
Where's the note?

05:19:29.560 --> 05:19:31.560
Where's the note?

05:19:37.560 --> 05:19:39.560
You said there was a note. Where's the fucking note?

05:19:45.560 --> 05:19:47.560
Where's the note?

05:20:01.560 --> 05:20:03.560
I can't stop and chat.

05:20:15.560 --> 05:20:17.560
That's it.

05:20:17.560 --> 05:20:19.560
It's Stephanie's forge.

05:20:31.560 --> 05:20:33.560
Hold on.

05:20:33.560 --> 05:20:35.560
Flashing lights in the cemetery, right?

05:20:35.560 --> 05:20:37.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:20:37.560 --> 05:20:39.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:20:45.560 --> 05:20:47.560
Can I move this?

05:20:51.560 --> 05:20:53.560
I moved it!

05:20:59.560 --> 05:21:01.560
Oh, my God!

05:21:01.560 --> 05:21:03.560
Thank God I found you.

05:21:03.560 --> 05:21:05.560
Are you all right, Karen?

05:21:05.560 --> 05:21:07.560
I want to go home.

05:21:07.560 --> 05:21:09.560
I'll be right back.

05:21:09.560 --> 05:21:11.560
I'll be right back.

05:21:11.560 --> 05:21:13.560
I found you.

05:21:13.560 --> 05:21:15.560
Are you all right, Karen?

05:21:15.560 --> 05:21:17.560
I want to go home.

05:21:17.560 --> 05:21:19.560
Could you take me to my mommy's store?

05:21:19.560 --> 05:21:21.560
Or to the policeman?

05:21:21.560 --> 05:21:23.560
Can you tell me who did this to you?

05:21:23.560 --> 05:21:25.560
Mr. Potstan

05:21:25.560 --> 05:21:27.560
told me he'd hurt my mommy

05:21:27.560 --> 05:21:29.560
if I told.

05:21:29.560 --> 05:21:31.560
Won't do anything, I promise.

05:21:31.560 --> 05:21:33.560
Tell me what happened.

05:21:33.560 --> 05:21:35.560
He made me play house.

05:21:35.560 --> 05:21:37.560
Then he dug a hole.

05:21:37.560 --> 05:21:39.560
Please.

05:21:39.560 --> 05:21:41.560
Can you go home now?

05:21:41.560 --> 05:21:43.560
Please.

05:21:43.560 --> 05:21:45.560
Can you tell me your address, honey?

05:21:45.560 --> 05:21:47.560
I don't know.

05:21:47.560 --> 05:21:49.560
Just take me to the store

05:21:49.560 --> 05:21:51.560
or the policeman.

05:21:51.560 --> 05:21:53.560
Please.

05:21:53.560 --> 05:21:55.560
Mommy said to go to the policeman

05:21:55.560 --> 05:21:57.560
if I got lost.

05:21:57.560 --> 05:21:59.560
And I'm lost.

05:22:01.560 --> 05:22:03.560
Bye bye.

05:22:03.560 --> 05:22:05.560
What do you mean bye bye? We need to take you home!

05:22:09.560 --> 05:22:11.560
How do I...

05:22:11.560 --> 05:22:13.560
What do you mean bye bye?

05:22:13.560 --> 05:22:15.560
We need to take you home!

05:22:15.560 --> 05:22:17.560
How do I take her home?

05:22:17.560 --> 05:22:19.560
What do you mean bye bye?

05:22:35.560 --> 05:22:37.560
I don't trust the police.

05:22:37.560 --> 05:22:39.560
I'm going back to the store.

05:22:39.560 --> 05:22:41.560
What the hell?

05:22:41.560 --> 05:22:43.560
Bring it! Thank you.

05:23:07.560 --> 05:23:09.560
Bye bye.

05:23:17.560 --> 05:23:19.560
I can't talk now.

05:23:19.560 --> 05:23:21.560
The dishes are stacked up.

05:23:23.560 --> 05:23:25.560
Okay!

05:23:27.560 --> 05:23:29.560
I have money now!

05:23:33.560 --> 05:23:35.560
I have money, right?

05:23:35.560 --> 05:23:37.560
To the store?

05:23:39.560 --> 05:23:41.560
And buy things?

05:23:41.560 --> 05:23:43.560
Oh shit. I should save the game!

05:23:43.560 --> 05:23:45.560
I should save!

05:23:59.560 --> 05:24:01.560
Wait.

05:24:01.560 --> 05:24:03.560
Where's the money?

05:24:03.560 --> 05:24:05.560
I borrowed money.

05:24:13.560 --> 05:24:15.560
I want that.

05:24:15.560 --> 05:24:17.560
And I want this.

05:24:19.560 --> 05:24:21.560
Oops.

05:24:21.560 --> 05:24:23.560
Did I make a mistake?

05:24:33.560 --> 05:24:35.560
That should cover it.

05:24:35.560 --> 05:24:37.560
These 1950s prices are cheap.

05:24:37.560 --> 05:24:39.560
Take what you need.

05:24:47.560 --> 05:24:49.560
I don't need anything, right?

05:24:49.560 --> 05:24:51.560
Wait. I need that.

05:24:53.560 --> 05:24:55.560
I think that's all I need?

05:24:55.560 --> 05:24:57.560
Yeah.

05:24:59.560 --> 05:25:01.560
Are we going to be able to complete this game tonight?

05:25:03.560 --> 05:25:05.560
I don't know!

05:25:07.560 --> 05:25:09.560
No thanks.

05:25:25.560 --> 05:25:27.560
Can I go down?

05:25:27.560 --> 05:25:29.560
Thanks.

05:25:33.560 --> 05:25:35.560
Where's the closet again?

05:25:35.560 --> 05:25:37.560
This one?

05:25:39.560 --> 05:25:41.560
Maybe I should save.

05:25:43.560 --> 05:25:45.560
Save game.

05:25:57.560 --> 05:25:59.560
Well that didn't work.

05:25:59.560 --> 05:26:01.560
Oh man.

05:26:01.560 --> 05:26:03.560
Oh man.

05:26:03.560 --> 05:26:05.560
Well that didn't work.

05:26:05.560 --> 05:26:07.560
Oh man.

05:26:07.560 --> 05:26:09.560
Oh man.

05:26:09.560 --> 05:26:11.560
Well that didn't work.

05:26:11.560 --> 05:26:13.560
Wait. Which one is it?

05:26:21.560 --> 05:26:23.560
Wait. Which one is it?

05:26:23.560 --> 05:26:25.560
Guys! Which one is it?

05:26:31.560 --> 05:26:35.560
I couldn't get up in the morning.

05:26:39.560 --> 05:26:43.560
It feels kind of dark so I can't tell what time it is.

05:26:43.560 --> 05:26:45.560
What time it is?

05:26:59.560 --> 05:27:01.560
What's up?

05:27:01.560 --> 05:27:03.560
Get a tap?

05:27:13.560 --> 05:27:15.560
Okay.

05:27:23.560 --> 05:27:25.560
Can I go into the inn?

05:27:25.560 --> 05:27:27.560
I don't think I've been to the inn yet.

05:27:27.560 --> 05:27:29.560
Why are you talking like that?

05:27:41.560 --> 05:27:43.560
Why are you talking like that?

05:27:57.560 --> 05:27:59.560
Oh we have to steal the mall, right?

05:28:01.560 --> 05:28:03.560
But why does he...

05:28:03.560 --> 05:28:05.560
Why is he like...

05:28:09.560 --> 05:28:11.560
ETA big sale.

05:28:11.560 --> 05:28:13.560
Door is locked.

05:28:13.560 --> 05:28:15.560
Ugh.

05:28:25.560 --> 05:28:27.560
I have several places I can set fire to.

05:28:27.560 --> 05:28:29.560
Should I set fire?

05:28:29.560 --> 05:28:31.560
Not set fire.

05:28:31.560 --> 05:28:33.560
Should I do the...

05:28:33.560 --> 05:28:35.560
Barbershop?

05:28:37.560 --> 05:28:39.560
Let's save at the barbershop.

05:28:43.560 --> 05:28:45.560
Okay.

05:28:55.560 --> 05:28:57.560
Straight lace...

05:28:57.560 --> 05:28:59.560
Slot screws...

05:28:59.560 --> 05:29:01.560
Does the fill-up work with it?

05:29:03.560 --> 05:29:05.560
Well that didn't work.

05:29:05.560 --> 05:29:07.560
Well that didn't work.

05:29:13.560 --> 05:29:15.560
Yeah, it has a sprinkler system.

05:29:15.560 --> 05:29:17.560
Which is why I was wondering...

05:29:17.560 --> 05:29:19.560
I could use it.

05:29:21.560 --> 05:29:23.560
Well that didn't work.

05:29:23.560 --> 05:29:25.560
What about...

05:29:25.560 --> 05:29:27.560
The school's fire alarm?

05:29:45.560 --> 05:29:47.560
What about the school's fire alarm?

05:29:47.560 --> 05:29:49.560
What about the school's fire alarm?

05:29:49.560 --> 05:29:51.560
What about the school's fire alarm?

05:30:01.560 --> 05:30:03.560
I gotta get out of here.

05:30:15.560 --> 05:30:17.560
I can get an axe.

05:30:20.560 --> 05:30:22.560
I can get a ladder too.

05:30:29.560 --> 05:30:31.560
Wait, how do I get in?

05:30:37.560 --> 05:30:39.560
Wait someone, how do I get in?

05:30:41.560 --> 05:30:43.560
You just go in.

05:30:43.560 --> 05:30:45.560
It's not letting me, just go in.

05:30:49.560 --> 05:30:51.560
Wait what?

05:30:55.560 --> 05:30:57.560
There a hole in the second story window?

05:31:05.560 --> 05:31:07.560
Are you sure I can just go in?

05:31:07.560 --> 05:31:09.560
Damn it.

05:31:13.560 --> 05:31:15.560
Are you sure I can just go in?

05:31:21.560 --> 05:31:23.560
Okay.

05:31:31.560 --> 05:31:33.560
What?

05:31:33.560 --> 05:31:35.560
Try a ladder?

05:31:35.560 --> 05:31:37.560
A ladder on what?

05:31:57.560 --> 05:31:59.560
How do I get in?

05:32:03.560 --> 05:32:05.560
Okay.

05:32:15.560 --> 05:32:17.560
I don't get it.

05:32:19.560 --> 05:32:21.560
Oh man.

05:32:21.560 --> 05:32:23.560
Help!

05:32:23.560 --> 05:32:25.560
Help, help!

05:32:25.560 --> 05:32:27.560
Help!

05:32:33.560 --> 05:32:35.560
Help!

05:32:45.560 --> 05:32:49.560
Am I supposed to go to the school then?

05:33:03.560 --> 05:33:05.560
Help!

05:33:23.560 --> 05:33:27.560
Okay, but I want to go into the place.

05:33:27.560 --> 05:33:33.560
I have to get out in at night?

05:33:35.560 --> 05:33:37.560
Aw.

05:33:57.560 --> 05:33:59.560
Give me back my key.

05:34:05.560 --> 05:34:07.560
Okay.

05:34:07.560 --> 05:34:09.560
No?

05:34:11.560 --> 05:34:13.560
Which is the closet?

05:34:13.560 --> 05:34:15.560
Which is the closet?

05:34:29.560 --> 05:34:31.560
All the alarm at my house?

05:34:31.560 --> 05:34:33.560
Okay.

05:34:43.560 --> 05:34:45.560
What do I just push it?

05:34:47.560 --> 05:34:49.560
Of the axe?

05:34:53.560 --> 05:34:55.560
Do I use the ladder then?

05:34:57.560 --> 05:34:59.560
Damn it.

05:35:01.560 --> 05:35:03.560
Uh, wrench?

05:35:09.560 --> 05:35:11.560
Use axe on brother, I would do that.

05:35:14.560 --> 05:35:16.560
He didn't care.

05:35:36.560 --> 05:35:40.560
Do I use the ladder here?

05:35:43.560 --> 05:35:45.560
Okay.

05:35:45.560 --> 05:35:47.560
Oh man.

05:35:53.560 --> 05:35:55.560
Okay.

05:36:13.560 --> 05:36:15.560
Hmm.

05:36:23.560 --> 05:36:27.560
I should change to a magnifying glass, huh?

05:36:27.560 --> 05:36:29.560
Is it changing?

05:36:31.560 --> 05:36:33.560
I think you need a furniture dolly.

05:36:33.560 --> 05:36:35.560
A dolly?

05:36:39.560 --> 05:36:41.560
What am I going to get a dolly?

05:36:43.560 --> 05:36:45.560
Okay.

05:36:55.560 --> 05:36:57.560
How are you not tired?

05:36:57.560 --> 05:37:03.560
I'm a bit tired, but I want to finish this day first, Senpai.

05:37:03.560 --> 05:37:09.560
I want to finish this day first, and then maybe we can, you know...

05:37:13.560 --> 05:37:15.560
Okay.

05:37:19.560 --> 05:37:23.560
Then we move on to the next day.

05:37:23.560 --> 05:37:25.560
Oh man.

05:37:25.560 --> 05:37:27.560
Okay.

05:37:27.560 --> 05:37:29.560
Okay.

05:37:35.560 --> 05:37:39.560
I'm not, I don't have the same stamina as Shibi or...

05:37:39.560 --> 05:37:41.560
...our mummy.

05:37:41.560 --> 05:37:44.560
But I do, I am kind of like oof.

05:37:44.560 --> 05:37:46.560
Tired.

05:37:51.560 --> 05:37:53.560
Is there a dolly here?

05:38:09.560 --> 05:38:11.560
Mr. Johnson's garage?

05:38:30.560 --> 05:38:32.560
Oops.

05:38:32.560 --> 05:38:34.560
Fatboy, well I'll make the carrot.

05:38:34.560 --> 05:38:36.560
I'll make the carrot.

05:38:36.560 --> 05:38:38.560
Fatboy, huh?

05:38:46.560 --> 05:38:48.560
What do you mean?

05:38:50.560 --> 05:38:52.560
What do you mean?

05:38:56.560 --> 05:38:58.560
What do you mean?

05:38:58.560 --> 05:39:00.560
I messed it up for you.

05:39:00.560 --> 05:39:02.560
What?

05:39:03.560 --> 05:39:05.560
Can I go in here?

05:39:20.560 --> 05:39:22.560
Oh.

05:39:22.560 --> 05:39:24.560
Okay.

05:39:26.560 --> 05:39:28.560
Anything else I need?

05:39:31.560 --> 05:39:35.560
I can just go in and out, huh? That's kind of weird.

05:39:49.560 --> 05:39:51.560
What? Why?

05:39:51.560 --> 05:39:53.560
Okay, bye.

05:39:53.560 --> 05:39:57.560
Suddenly the dialogue came back?

05:40:00.560 --> 05:40:02.560
Okay.

05:40:11.560 --> 05:40:13.560
What's this?

05:40:15.560 --> 05:40:17.560
Turn off the alarm system.

05:40:19.560 --> 05:40:21.560
Okay, let's save here.

05:40:31.560 --> 05:40:36.560
What? Undo the screws?

05:40:42.560 --> 05:40:46.560
This photograph is a constant torture for borrowed dad.

05:40:46.560 --> 05:40:48.560
Exotic kinky love equipment.

05:40:48.560 --> 05:40:50.560
No, leave that there.

05:40:50.560 --> 05:40:52.560
If any of it turns up missing.

05:40:54.560 --> 05:40:57.560
Marv, what's going on in there?

05:41:01.560 --> 05:41:03.560
Go! Go!

05:41:03.560 --> 05:41:07.560
Wait, no dad, I need you. I need you to sign this first.

05:41:07.560 --> 05:41:12.560
I need some meat, and Pat won't give me any without your sign permission.

05:41:12.560 --> 05:41:14.560
Good old dependable Pat.

05:41:14.560 --> 05:41:18.560
Here son, here's my signature.

05:41:18.560 --> 05:41:21.560
Take it to him, and you won't have any problem.

05:41:21.560 --> 05:41:25.560
Now go son, go quickly, before she comes back.

05:41:26.560 --> 05:41:29.560
Not yet, dad, I want to talk to you.

05:41:34.560 --> 05:41:38.560
Are you my father? Really? I don't remember you.

05:41:38.560 --> 05:41:42.560
Please. I'm not in the mood for jokes.

05:41:42.560 --> 05:41:44.560
I'm serious, why won't anyone believe me?

05:41:44.560 --> 05:41:47.560
Oh my gosh, that's all you care about?

05:41:47.560 --> 05:41:51.560
Just don't make me laugh now.

05:41:51.560 --> 05:41:56.560
Remember the stitches? My God, what has she done to you?

05:41:56.560 --> 05:42:00.560
She doesn't know you're here, does she? Does she?

05:42:03.560 --> 05:42:07.560
No, I had to break in. What the hell is going on in here?

05:42:07.560 --> 05:42:09.560
I know it's a mystery to you.

05:42:09.560 --> 05:42:14.560
The sacred things that husband wants you behind closed doors.

05:42:14.560 --> 05:42:18.560
Maybe we should have the special father's son dog.

05:42:19.560 --> 05:42:22.560
The special father's son dog?

05:42:23.560 --> 05:42:25.560
Yeah, I'd like that.

05:42:41.560 --> 05:42:43.560
Okay. Yeah?

05:42:49.560 --> 05:42:52.560
And bolt it with at least three locks.

05:42:52.560 --> 05:42:54.560
At least three?

05:43:14.560 --> 05:43:16.560
Aww.

05:43:18.560 --> 05:43:22.560
They close on the woman, and then they...

05:43:25.560 --> 05:43:28.560
With the barbed wire, they...

05:43:30.560 --> 05:43:34.560
That's all right, don't get worked up. You need your rest.

05:43:34.560 --> 05:43:37.560
Yes, rest.

05:43:37.560 --> 05:43:39.560
But why did you come?

05:43:39.560 --> 05:43:43.560
You must have had a reason for risking it.

05:43:43.560 --> 05:43:47.560
I need some meat, and Pat won't give me any without your signed permission.

05:43:47.560 --> 05:43:49.560
Good old dependable, Pat.

05:43:49.560 --> 05:43:53.560
Here, son. Here's my signature.

05:43:53.560 --> 05:43:56.560
Take it to him, and you won't have any problem.

05:43:56.560 --> 05:44:00.560
Now go, son. Go quickly, before she comes back.

05:44:05.560 --> 05:44:09.560
This is no time to talk, gibberish. Get out of here.

05:44:09.560 --> 05:44:11.560
Now!

05:44:11.560 --> 05:44:14.560
I love you, Dad.

05:44:14.560 --> 05:44:16.560
This is no time to talk.

05:44:16.560 --> 05:44:17.560
Love?

05:44:17.560 --> 05:44:18.560
This is no time to talk.

05:44:18.560 --> 05:44:20.560
Okay. Bye, Dad.

05:44:25.560 --> 05:44:27.560
So do I put it back?

05:44:27.560 --> 05:44:29.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:44:29.560 --> 05:44:31.560
Aw, man.

05:44:31.560 --> 05:44:33.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:44:35.560 --> 05:44:37.560
Huh.

05:44:39.560 --> 05:44:41.560
Okay, well...

05:44:41.560 --> 05:44:43.560
At least...

05:44:43.560 --> 05:44:45.560
I don't know what to do.

05:44:45.560 --> 05:44:47.560
I don't know what to do.

05:44:47.560 --> 05:44:49.560
I don't know what to do.

05:44:49.560 --> 05:44:51.560
I don't know what to do.

05:44:51.560 --> 05:44:53.560
I don't know what to do.

05:44:53.560 --> 05:44:55.560
Okay, well...

05:44:55.560 --> 05:44:57.560
At least...

05:44:57.560 --> 05:45:00.560
Dad taught me the last words.

05:45:00.560 --> 05:45:03.560
With his last words about what...

05:45:03.560 --> 05:45:05.560
What the...

05:45:05.560 --> 05:45:07.560
You know, married couples do.

05:45:24.560 --> 05:45:27.560
Yeah, Dad taught us a lot.

05:45:27.560 --> 05:45:29.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:45:29.560 --> 05:45:31.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:45:31.560 --> 05:45:33.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:45:33.560 --> 05:45:35.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:45:35.560 --> 05:45:37.560
That won't happen to us, right, Kohai?

05:45:37.560 --> 05:45:39.560
Just be good.

05:45:43.560 --> 05:45:45.560
I guess I'll go to the meat plant.

05:45:45.560 --> 05:45:47.560
And I'll give myself some meat.

05:45:47.560 --> 05:45:49.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:45:49.560 --> 05:45:51.560
So, your father okayed the meat, huh?

05:45:51.560 --> 05:45:53.560
How's he doing?

05:45:55.560 --> 05:45:57.560
Um...

05:46:15.560 --> 05:46:17.560
Two? Two?

05:46:17.560 --> 05:46:19.560
What if I say the first one?

05:46:21.560 --> 05:46:23.560
What if I say the first one?

05:46:23.560 --> 05:46:25.560
Will I get in trouble? Will I die?

05:46:29.560 --> 05:46:31.560
I should save first.

05:46:31.560 --> 05:46:33.560
No, I can't save right now.

05:46:33.560 --> 05:46:35.560
I can't save right now.

05:46:43.560 --> 05:46:45.560
Okay, fine.

05:46:45.560 --> 05:46:47.560
First one, first one.

05:46:55.560 --> 05:46:57.560
He didn't care.

05:47:03.560 --> 05:47:05.560
He didn't care.

05:47:29.560 --> 05:47:31.560
He didn't care.

05:47:31.560 --> 05:47:33.560
He didn't care.

05:47:41.560 --> 05:47:43.560
Wait, why is it nighttime already?

05:47:47.560 --> 05:47:49.560
Did I, did I...

05:47:49.560 --> 05:47:51.560
I didn't even get the firefighter stuff.

05:47:51.560 --> 05:47:53.560
Wait.

05:47:53.560 --> 05:47:55.560
Stop, Steve.

05:48:21.560 --> 05:48:23.560
Dead.

05:48:23.560 --> 05:48:25.560
Dead.

05:48:47.560 --> 05:48:49.560
Yes.

05:48:51.560 --> 05:48:53.560
Yeah, you gonna rat on me?

05:49:17.560 --> 05:49:19.560
Here?

05:49:21.560 --> 05:49:23.560
Yeah.

05:49:35.560 --> 05:49:37.560
Somewhere, huh?

05:49:37.560 --> 05:49:39.560
Darkness vaults.

05:49:39.560 --> 05:49:41.560
I forgot what he said.

05:49:51.560 --> 05:49:53.560
Huh.

05:50:03.560 --> 05:50:05.560
Okay, fine.

05:50:09.560 --> 05:50:11.560
Huh!

05:50:21.560 --> 05:50:23.560
Well, that didn't work.

05:50:23.560 --> 05:50:25.560
All right.

05:50:39.560 --> 05:50:41.560
Can I turn it off now?

05:50:41.560 --> 05:50:43.560
Do I have it?

05:50:51.560 --> 05:50:53.560
Yeah, I got it.

05:50:53.560 --> 05:50:55.560
Thanks.

05:51:03.560 --> 05:51:05.560
Okay, I'm gonna go.

05:51:05.560 --> 05:51:07.560
I'm gonna go now.

05:51:11.560 --> 05:51:13.560
Uh, see ya.

05:51:21.560 --> 05:51:23.560
This game is so crunchy.

05:51:23.560 --> 05:51:27.560
Well, this game is from what year was this game out?

05:51:29.560 --> 05:51:31.560
When year did this game come out?

05:51:31.560 --> 05:51:33.560
Arvester game.

05:51:37.560 --> 05:51:39.560
1996.

05:51:39.560 --> 05:51:41.560
Okay.

05:51:41.560 --> 05:51:43.560
It's old.

05:51:43.560 --> 05:51:45.560
I can't believe.

05:51:45.560 --> 05:51:47.560
He sleeps in jeans.

05:51:47.560 --> 05:51:49.560
Steve sleeps in jeans.

05:51:51.560 --> 05:51:53.560
Yes.

05:51:53.560 --> 05:52:03.560
What do you people want from me?

05:52:03.560 --> 05:52:15.560
Welcome to our Horde, the land that grips the life of its death.

05:52:15.560 --> 05:52:17.560
Stephanie.

05:52:17.560 --> 05:52:25.560
1996 is old? Do you know when the internet was made?

05:52:25.560 --> 05:52:29.560
Senpai. Do you know when the internet was made?

05:52:29.560 --> 05:52:33.560
When the internet went public?

05:52:33.560 --> 05:52:43.560
95. This is one year after. Okay?

05:52:43.560 --> 05:52:45.560
Oh my gosh.

05:52:45.560 --> 05:52:49.560
Well, we're gonna save here.

05:52:49.560 --> 05:52:55.560
I'm tired.

05:52:55.560 --> 05:53:03.560
I'm tired, and I think I want to take a nap.

05:53:03.560 --> 05:53:07.560
Well, a big sleep.

05:53:07.560 --> 05:53:17.560
I want to take a big sleep.

05:53:17.560 --> 05:53:23.560
I think about...

05:53:23.560 --> 05:53:31.560
Don't look Senpai. Don't look at my steam. Don't look.

05:53:31.560 --> 05:53:41.560
I don't know why it does that.

05:53:41.560 --> 05:53:51.560
Okay.

05:53:51.560 --> 05:53:57.560
Alright. Senpai.

05:53:57.560 --> 05:54:07.560
This tomorrow will be the end, officially the end of the first week since debut.

05:54:07.560 --> 05:54:13.560
Tomorrow I'll be playing Death Mark.

05:54:13.560 --> 05:54:17.560
So...

05:54:17.560 --> 05:54:29.560
And that will be probably the final of the genre of games that I like the most.

05:54:29.560 --> 05:54:41.560
And that is the preview of all facets of me, Mercy Modest.

05:54:41.560 --> 05:54:51.560
So, you can, as you saw, those were all games that I particularly...

05:54:51.560 --> 05:54:55.560
genre of games that I particularly like. I feel like...

05:54:55.560 --> 05:55:03.560
I feel like my point-and-click love really shone through in today's stream.

05:55:03.560 --> 05:55:08.560
So, I think that this is probably a good one.

05:55:08.560 --> 05:55:14.560
Honestly, I'm super invested. This is why I love point-and-clicks.

05:55:14.560 --> 05:55:20.560
I really love point-and-clicks because they are definitely a genre I really love.

05:55:20.560 --> 05:55:26.560
It's a genre that I grew up with. It's a genre where it's a lot of storytelling

05:55:26.560 --> 05:55:36.560
and a lot of problem solving, and that's like some things that I really like.

05:55:36.560 --> 05:55:40.560
So, honestly, I want to play more point-and-clicks.

05:55:40.560 --> 05:55:44.560
We're definitely going to return to Harvester, hopefully.

05:55:44.560 --> 05:55:54.560
When I stream it next time, I can finish it, hopefully.

05:55:54.560 --> 05:56:02.560
And yeah, I played a lot of point-and-clicks. I played a lot of point-and-clicks. A lot.

05:56:02.560 --> 05:56:10.560
So, if there's a chance I can play another one for Senpai's, I think I'll be great.

05:56:20.560 --> 05:56:24.560
Will you be playing Miss Slash the Riven series? I'm not sure.

05:56:24.560 --> 05:56:30.560
Miss is kind of 3D, right? I might. I might.

05:56:32.560 --> 05:56:36.560
Oh, what else?

05:56:36.560 --> 05:56:48.560
I might take a day off my schedule for next week's stream simply because I'm really exhausted Senpai.

05:56:48.560 --> 05:56:54.560
A week of full streaming, no breaks. I'm really exhausted Senpai.

05:56:54.560 --> 05:57:04.560
Tomorrow, yeah, we're playing Death Mark, which is a visual novel game.

05:57:04.560 --> 05:57:14.560
I played it a bit, but I took a huge break from it, so it will feel like starting fresh again.

05:57:14.560 --> 05:57:22.560
And I don't remember a lot of the puzzles or the gameplay, so we should be fine.

05:57:23.560 --> 05:57:25.560
What else? What else?

05:57:25.560 --> 05:57:36.560
Oh yeah, and tomorrow, I probably won't be late, but I'm really looking forward to it because my IRL friends are going to treat me to sushi

05:57:36.560 --> 05:57:43.560
because they're like, congratulations on getting into Fialor, so I'm very happy.

05:57:44.560 --> 05:57:54.560
I'm very happy that I can go meet out with my friends, but I probably am going to cut it short so I can come back and stream.

05:58:00.560 --> 05:58:03.560
Are you going to be altering the times you stream? No.

05:58:03.560 --> 05:58:21.560
Now, Fialor has kind of divided everyone into certain time slots to cover a variety of time zones, and I've taken over this time slot.

05:58:21.560 --> 05:58:30.560
So unfortunately, I will be streaming all my streams to be at the same time, will start at the same time every time.

05:58:34.560 --> 05:58:48.560
I'll see, except for, I think, when there are collabs, when there are collabs or special occasions, then I think the time is going to be a little bit more off.

05:58:51.560 --> 05:59:00.560
Unfortunately, is it not a good time for you? I worry it's not a good time for senpais, because I know there are some senpais that want to catch me,

05:59:00.560 --> 05:59:06.560
but unfortunately, I'm not matching their time zones. I hope that makes sense.

05:59:06.560 --> 05:59:12.560
This makes me a little sad that some senpais won't be able to watch me.

05:59:12.560 --> 05:59:26.560
I'd really like to cater to awesome pies, but at the same time, I don't want to overlap completely with my gen mates as well.

05:59:26.560 --> 05:59:36.560
And we all start at certain times, which makes us available, like all of us available for our certain times.

05:59:39.560 --> 05:59:47.560
So I feel bad that some senpais will be left out, which is why I say that.

05:59:48.560 --> 06:00:06.560
So I still hope that the senpais that can't catch me will catch the vods, although I think there's something a little special about seeing things live,

06:00:07.560 --> 06:00:14.560
which is why I feel a little sad, and that's why I say, unfortunately, instead of I'm glad.

06:00:14.560 --> 06:00:20.560
I am glad that I get to have a time slot where I can do a lot of things in the daytime

06:00:20.560 --> 06:00:35.560
and like be able to hang out with mama and papa and do my chores and just get ready for the day for stream.

06:00:35.560 --> 06:00:45.560
And then at night time, I can stream and be like entertaining and I can be with my senpais.

06:00:46.560 --> 06:01:03.560
But yeah, I feel a little bad that I can't cater to everyone, but I don't want to step on anyone's toes for their specific time slots as well.

06:01:03.560 --> 06:01:14.560
I picked this time because it's the time where I'm kind of used to as well.

06:01:15.560 --> 06:01:27.560
Yeah, at the end of the day, time zones are hard work for everyone.

06:01:27.560 --> 06:01:29.560
Yeah, I'll try my best.

06:01:29.560 --> 06:01:35.560
Maybe one day I'll schedule in some earlier streams, but once again, I kind of don't want to step on toes,

06:01:35.560 --> 06:01:45.560
but I'll ask management if there's like a day where there's not a lot of, if many of my gen mates are having time off or something,

06:01:45.560 --> 06:01:53.560
I can slip in a earlier stream.

06:01:54.560 --> 06:02:06.560
I want everyone to enjoy Mercy Modi's.

06:02:06.560 --> 06:02:19.560
Gorilla, I don't want to do gorilla all too much because I feel like if I do a gorilla stream that there are going to be some people who miss out and then they'll feel bad about it.

06:02:19.560 --> 06:02:26.560
They'll feel like they've been left out, you know?

06:02:26.560 --> 06:02:31.560
That's my feel on it.

06:02:31.560 --> 06:02:39.560
I know that my gen mates will do it, but I feel like...

06:02:39.560 --> 06:02:41.560
What is a gorilla stream?

06:02:41.560 --> 06:02:46.560
It's a stream that's unannounced, so I just go on in the stream, you know?

06:02:46.560 --> 06:02:57.560
Like, surprise! It's not on the schedule, but here we go!

06:02:57.560 --> 06:03:07.560
So, I don't want my senpais to be like, I missed it! No! Or I didn't know she was doing that stream!

06:03:07.560 --> 06:03:13.560
I don't want senpais to feel left out, so I'd rather schedule it.

06:03:13.560 --> 06:03:27.560
If senpais really wanted to watch it, they can plan around it.

06:03:27.560 --> 06:03:38.560
I feel like my gen mates are free to do what they want, but this is my own personal belief.

06:03:38.560 --> 06:03:46.560
That's my opinion. It's my own personal belief, so don't think that the way that I think is going to be the way my gen mates think.

06:03:46.560 --> 06:03:56.560
I'm very much a traditionalist in a way, so for example, my gen mates, they are free to talk about past lives and stuff,

06:03:56.560 --> 06:04:03.560
but I'm definitely not a person who wants to discuss it, but not discuss my own personal past life.

06:04:03.560 --> 06:04:17.560
I don't mind if they talk to me about their past lives, but I don't want to talk about my past life type of thing.

06:04:17.560 --> 06:04:32.560
And I think the only times I'll ever do a gorilla stream is if I'm on vacation, but even then I'll feel bad for senpais who missed it, you know?

06:04:33.560 --> 06:04:53.560
I know there's a lot of freedom and stuff within violor, but I'm still in kind of the idol mindset.

06:04:53.560 --> 06:04:56.560
I'm very much in the idol mindset.

06:05:03.560 --> 06:05:17.560
I don't know if there's like, you know, if there's a market for like an arrow idol.

06:05:17.560 --> 06:05:37.560
But yeah, I think, I think, yeah, I'm very much pretty much a traditionalist.

06:05:37.560 --> 06:05:42.560
I follow the JP formula a lot.

06:05:48.560 --> 06:05:54.560
I hope that, honestly, I'm kind of like Strani.

06:05:54.560 --> 06:06:01.560
I kind of want to have like the idol, the idol outfits, like the idol concert type of thing.

06:06:01.560 --> 06:06:17.560
I know it's not traditional and some people might be very opposed to it.

06:06:17.560 --> 06:06:18.560
Yeah.

06:06:21.560 --> 06:06:27.560
Some people might be opposed to it, but it's kind of like, it's kind of my dream.

06:06:27.560 --> 06:06:28.560
Senpai.

06:06:28.560 --> 06:06:35.560
You know, it's a little bit of my dream to try to pursue being an idol.

06:06:35.560 --> 06:06:37.560
Just a little bit.

06:06:37.560 --> 06:06:44.560
It doesn't have to be completely, since all paths are strange.

06:06:47.560 --> 06:06:55.560
But you know, ever since I watched Creamy Mami, I was like, I love this, I love this so much.

06:06:58.560 --> 06:07:18.560
But my number one dream is, of course, to like, make my Senpai's happy and smile.

06:07:18.560 --> 06:07:20.560
I really like, I really like that show, though.

06:07:20.560 --> 06:07:22.560
I love the song.

06:07:29.560 --> 06:07:33.560
Any specific idol outfits you like?

06:07:33.560 --> 06:07:40.560
I kind of like the, they're all kind of like marching band slash military-esque.

06:07:40.560 --> 06:07:45.560
I kind of like the pastel colored ones.

06:07:45.560 --> 06:07:58.560
And the ones that are like, the one that are kind of poofy, like poofy skirts.

06:07:58.560 --> 06:08:01.560
Thank you, Anonymous, for the 420.

06:08:01.560 --> 06:08:05.560
Yeah, blaze it, or whatever them kids say.

06:08:11.560 --> 06:08:13.560
What do you mean, peculiar aesthetics?

06:08:13.560 --> 06:08:15.560
It's just the idol look.

06:08:20.560 --> 06:08:22.560
It's just the idol look.

06:08:25.560 --> 06:08:27.560
Creamy Mami will be our next home marker.

06:08:27.560 --> 06:08:28.560
No, no, no.

06:08:28.560 --> 06:08:41.560
I think Creamy Mami will be too long for, and I think Creamy Mami is also a little bit harder to digest for Senpai's because of its age.

06:08:41.560 --> 06:08:46.560
Being a very early Magical Girl series, it's also very long.

06:08:46.560 --> 06:08:57.560
So I feel Cardcaptor Sakura is digestible and that it can be marathoned, but Creamy Mami, I don't think, is a marathonable.

06:08:59.560 --> 06:09:01.560
Not Minky Momo.

06:09:03.560 --> 06:09:10.560
Minky Momo is, it was definitely a wild ride.

06:09:11.560 --> 06:09:26.560
But I feel like Cardcaptor Sakura is kind of one of the things that I really appreciate.

06:09:26.560 --> 06:09:45.560
I won't lie to Senpai's, but Cardcaptor Sakura literally got me through some really hard times.

06:09:45.560 --> 06:09:47.560
She literally saved my life.

06:09:47.560 --> 06:09:54.560
Oh hi, look up the Curse of Minky Momo.

06:09:54.560 --> 06:09:57.560
I already know the Curse of Minky Momo.

06:09:59.560 --> 06:10:02.560
I already know the Curse of Minky Momo.

06:10:08.560 --> 06:10:11.560
I know, I know it, I know it.

06:10:12.560 --> 06:10:21.560
And if you, if Senpai's don't know it, just, I think, who's the YouTuber that covers it very well?

06:10:21.560 --> 06:10:23.560
Kenny Lauderdale?

06:10:23.560 --> 06:10:27.560
Yeah, that YouTuber covers it quite well.

06:10:27.560 --> 06:10:44.560
The original, right? Not the Novana dub. I actually grew up with the Novana dub, but I love the original.

06:10:44.560 --> 06:10:48.560
I think both of them are really good, actually.

06:10:48.560 --> 06:10:56.560
The Novana dub, people are like, oh, it's bad, whatever. I think it's still a little bit, I think, despite it being a dub,

06:10:56.560 --> 06:11:00.560
I feel like this voice is suited the characters quite well.

06:11:08.560 --> 06:11:14.560
But Sakura has a saying that she keeps on like a mantra that she says,

06:11:14.560 --> 06:11:21.560
and I've used that mantra to get through hard times a lot, which is, surely everything will be alright.

06:11:27.560 --> 06:11:30.560
So that's gotten me through, like, really tough times.

06:11:36.560 --> 06:11:40.560
Truly, surely, whatever, it's the same, it's the same mantra.

06:11:45.560 --> 06:11:49.560
So, yeah, Cardcaptor Sakura literally saved my life.

06:11:49.560 --> 06:11:51.560
So, uh...

06:11:55.560 --> 06:11:57.560
So, Senpai's will have to watch it, too.

06:11:58.560 --> 06:11:59.560
Understood?

06:12:01.560 --> 06:12:15.560
Actually, the other day, I went to GameStop and I saw the clown wand, and I was like, oh, so I got it.

06:12:15.560 --> 06:12:19.560
I got the wand, it's right underneath my desk.

06:12:26.560 --> 06:12:28.560
You don't have to watch Clear Card.

06:12:28.560 --> 06:12:34.560
I think for Senpai's homework would be just Season 1, Season 2, and then the two movies.

06:12:35.560 --> 06:12:46.560
So, the two movies will be the Cardcaptor Sakura, the movie, and then Cardcaptor Sakura, the sealed card.

06:12:46.560 --> 06:12:48.560
That'll be the second movie.

06:12:57.560 --> 06:13:00.560
So, yeah, I ended up buying the wand.

06:13:01.560 --> 06:13:15.560
A few years ago, my friends funded, put together some money, and then they got me the Sakura wand, you know, the Star Wand.

06:13:18.560 --> 06:13:21.560
They got me the Star Wand, and I was like, yeah!

06:13:22.560 --> 06:13:25.560
My wand, my angel's wand!

06:13:26.560 --> 06:13:32.560
Well, you ever have Movie Night in a Discord?

06:13:32.560 --> 06:13:34.560
Um, there's no Discord.

06:13:35.560 --> 06:13:39.560
There's fan Discord, but there's no Discord.

06:13:40.560 --> 06:13:41.560
Sorry.

06:13:44.560 --> 06:13:46.560
Did you do a pose with it before?

06:13:46.560 --> 06:13:48.560
Oh, yeah, I did.

06:13:48.560 --> 06:13:56.560
I did like the classic little, like, heal, heal down, and she, like, does the, when she captures a card.

06:14:03.560 --> 06:14:04.560
Did we use Discord?

06:14:04.560 --> 06:14:12.560
Yeah, we have a work Discord, and the Discord for work we can also chat in, but not a, like, official fan Discord.

06:14:12.560 --> 06:14:20.560
There's a, I think there's a Discord just for stream announcements, too.

06:14:30.560 --> 06:14:32.560
I don't think it would happen, though.

06:14:32.560 --> 06:14:36.560
I don't think a Discord where the girls are in will happen.

06:14:36.560 --> 06:14:38.560
Simply because of safety reasons.

06:14:39.560 --> 06:14:41.560
Because of safety reasons, Senpai.

06:14:50.560 --> 06:14:52.560
There's a...

06:14:54.560 --> 06:15:02.560
I'm not saying you, Senpai, will use it maliciously, but there are lots of other people who will use it maliciously.

06:15:02.560 --> 06:15:06.560
Which is why, um...

06:15:09.560 --> 06:15:21.560
Which is why we probably won't have a Discord, but we can interact with you through stream, YouTube comments, Maros, and on Twitter.

06:15:21.560 --> 06:15:36.560
So there's lots of avenues to, um, talk to, to talk to us as well.

06:15:36.560 --> 06:15:45.560
We might not always reply simply because there's just a lot of messages, but I'm always thankful.

06:15:46.560 --> 06:15:54.560
And I'm sure that my gen mates were also very thankful for all the kind messages that everyone leaves as well.

06:16:01.560 --> 06:16:08.560
So yeah, I might not always respond, but I will, I do, I do see it.

06:16:12.560 --> 06:16:13.560
I do see it.

06:16:14.560 --> 06:16:16.560
Yeah, Lori Kostrani's home for sad girls.

06:16:18.560 --> 06:16:20.560
I think we're very happy now, actually.

06:16:22.560 --> 06:16:24.560
We're very happy.

06:16:25.560 --> 06:16:32.560
I mean, like, let's be real, though. If you're a VTuber, you have some kind of metal Illinois.

06:16:44.560 --> 06:16:46.560
But...

06:17:01.560 --> 06:17:04.560
But, uh, it's definitely...

06:17:05.560 --> 06:17:10.560
All of us have our struggles, but, you know, we're here to entertain.

06:17:10.560 --> 06:17:12.560
In the end, we're here to entertain.

06:17:12.560 --> 06:17:22.560
And VLR has six wonderful talents for everyone to indulge in.

06:17:23.560 --> 06:17:26.560
I'm trying to wink, but I have an eye patch.

06:17:27.560 --> 06:17:28.560
Hahaha.

06:17:33.560 --> 06:17:35.560
You need an account to send in tomorrow?

06:17:35.560 --> 06:17:45.560
Uh, not necessarily, but if you want any of the girls, including myself, to reply, there's a chance that we'll reply privately.

06:17:45.560 --> 06:17:52.560
So if you want to be responded to privately, that would be, uh, you need an account.

06:17:53.560 --> 06:17:55.560
Hahaha.

06:17:58.560 --> 06:18:07.560
But if you don't mind the question just being, like, posted publicly on, like, the Mara Wall, then that's it.

06:18:09.560 --> 06:18:12.560
Sometimes I don't respond. I'm not...

06:18:13.560 --> 06:18:24.560
Because I feel like if I say thank you over and over, I just sound like a broken record, and I feel like I don't want to fill the Mara Wall completely with all my thank you.

06:18:24.560 --> 06:18:31.560
So I keep the Maros that are, like, compliments and saying nice things close to my heart instead.

06:18:31.560 --> 06:18:32.560
Hahaha.

06:18:34.560 --> 06:18:47.560
Also, yes, it's anonymous so that, um, so that there's still kind of a safety barrier for not only you, Senpai, but for us as well.

06:18:51.560 --> 06:18:52.560
Oh, yeah.

06:18:52.560 --> 06:18:53.560
Haha.

06:18:59.560 --> 06:19:09.560
So yeah, you...there's many avenues in which you can interact with us, so it's not too bad.

06:19:09.560 --> 06:19:11.560
It's not too bad, even if we don't have a Discord.

06:19:11.560 --> 06:19:14.560
But yeah, no Discord is a safety thing.

06:19:14.560 --> 06:19:16.560
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

06:19:21.560 --> 06:19:24.560
So I think that's it. I think that's it.

06:19:24.560 --> 06:19:25.560
Hmm.

06:19:25.560 --> 06:19:27.560
I say any more questions, Senpai.

06:19:27.560 --> 06:19:35.560
I'm willing to answer maybe a couple more if any any questions about Villalor, uh, props up.

06:19:35.560 --> 06:19:46.560
If not, I think we're done for today. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:19:51.560 --> 06:19:54.560
I just feel the stream for six hours again, all high.

06:19:54.560 --> 06:19:57.560
Well, it feels like it's gonna be probably the norm.

06:19:59.560 --> 06:20:02.560
I just considered the powerhouse of the south of the mitochondria.

06:20:02.560 --> 06:20:04.560
Hahaha.

06:20:11.560 --> 06:20:14.560
Will you be Justin Idol or a magical girl idol?

06:20:14.560 --> 06:20:18.560
Probably Justin Idol, a regular idol.

06:20:18.560 --> 06:20:22.560
Oh, by the way, what's today's English word? Right.

06:20:22.560 --> 06:20:40.560
Because, because mama, mama, those sort of things that your student sort of, but like has recently called you fans.

06:20:40.560 --> 06:20:42.560
Let me think.

06:20:48.560 --> 06:21:17.560
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I don't want to use another D word, even though D words, uh,

06:21:17.560 --> 06:21:26.560
D words, D words are, D words are always on the mind.

06:21:26.560 --> 06:21:39.560
How about. Hmm. Meek.

06:21:39.560 --> 06:21:45.560
Let's see, let's use the word meek today.

06:21:45.560 --> 06:21:50.560
M-E-E-K. Meek.

06:21:50.560 --> 06:21:53.560
Quiet, gentle and easily imposed on.

06:21:53.560 --> 06:21:56.560
Use it in a sentence.

06:22:00.560 --> 06:22:05.560
Use it in a sentence is, you know.

06:22:05.560 --> 06:22:11.560
Um, Mercy Maudiste is sometimes very meek.

06:22:12.560 --> 06:22:18.560
Hahaha.

06:22:29.560 --> 06:22:32.560
Yeah, that's our word of the day.

06:22:32.560 --> 06:22:37.560
Thank you for joining me, Senpai.

06:22:37.560 --> 06:22:44.560
And I hope to see you again awfully tomorrow. Okay?

06:22:44.560 --> 06:22:48.560
Hehehe.

06:22:48.560 --> 06:22:53.560
Are you ready?

06:22:53.560 --> 06:22:56.560
Wait, wait, I forgot to say, are you ready?

06:22:56.560 --> 06:22:59.560
But then I was like, can I, can I raid someone?

06:22:59.560 --> 06:23:02.560
I think it's very light, so I don't have anyone to raid into.

06:23:02.560 --> 06:23:05.560
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I don't have anyone to raid into.

06:23:05.560 --> 06:23:08.560
So, it's just gonna be the end of the stream now.

06:23:08.560 --> 06:23:10.560
So, ready?

06:23:10.560 --> 06:23:12.560
One more time.

06:23:12.560 --> 06:23:14.560
Ah, ah, ah.

06:23:14.560 --> 06:23:16.560
Stream for Mercy!

06:23:16.560 --> 06:23:18.560
Bye-bye!

06:23:18.560 --> 06:23:21.560
Mwah!

06:23:21.560 --> 06:23:24.560
Where is it? There it is.

06:23:35.560 --> 06:23:38.560
Mwah!
