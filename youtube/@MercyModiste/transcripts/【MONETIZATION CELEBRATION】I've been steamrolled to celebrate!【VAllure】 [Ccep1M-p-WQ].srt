1
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,100
to

2
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:29,280
.

3
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Holy crap

4
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Holy carps

5
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800

8
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
Thank you

9
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Everyone

10
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
For all

11
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you eat be a little bit, okay?

12
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,520
I'll tell you guys why I'm super eat be right now at first. I was gonna do a hand camp stream, but

13
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Um

14
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yesterday if you saw my twitters, uh

15
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
You saw my Twitter I

16
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, I got a pretty bad rash on my arm my dominant. What's what's worse is it's my dominant arm right now, and I've

17
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,360
But for a stream I've iced it for like one hour and

18
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,080
Basically, it's kind of like it's if it doesn't go away by

19
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,760
If it doesn't go away by by by by

20
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,160
Saturday, I'm gonna go to the doctor

21
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,680
What happened? I don't know it's just an allergic reaction. It just happens sometimes

22
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,200
Which one is your dominant hand my right so it's my right arm that's got

23
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,400
That got so it's like super. It's red. It's as red as like a lobster

24
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,280
It's as red as a lobster and really really itchy and

25
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,600
I accidentally scratched it and it started bleeding

26
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,040
So we're not gonna do that and so I'm going to spare my senpai's worry by not

27
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Doing a hand camp stream

28
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Yeah

29
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,480
Did you smear eggs all over your arm? I don't think so, but I might have touched something that had eggs on it

30
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
And then I just like flared up real bad

31
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
That just happens

32
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,880
That just happens like it was so red

33
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,080
It was so red like I was like oh dear. That's probably not good

34
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,280
Your allergy is that bad? I have to go to the hospital if it's super severe

35
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
especially

36
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Especially if I ingest it

37
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,280
Anyways, so for today's stream instead

38
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,840
We're going to do things one-handed or at least it's possible to play with one hand and that is for today

39
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,640
For my membership. I am so happy to announce that memberships have opened as well as

40
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
As well as

41
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,160
As super chats and stuff. I think yes. Yes. Those are all open. Okay, but

42
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Thank you so much senpai. It's always been my dream to

43
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,980
Make it this far as well. I have lots of goals and we're gonna we're gonna just just smash right through them. I

44
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,400
Think everyone can send super chest. I think yeah

45
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah

46
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
so um

47
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
I

48
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,400
Got a smash right through them. So today we are going to play a game. I

49
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Might regret this I

50
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,000
Might regret this not seeing it available. Dang. Maybe it's just memberships only. Okay. I

51
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,520
Might regret this. Are you ready? I

52
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,280
Have tripled up on medication. I have senpai's gift to me for this

53
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:56,600
Anti-nausea bracelet thing that's sending electric waves and it kind of kind of feels funky. I have that I have ginger tea

54
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Thank you, you know for with the 420 congratulations to our kohai Mercy truly lights up our lives here in this lovingly furnished

55
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,640
Basement greater than any celestial body can manage

56
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,360
Let her smile warm your soul and hey, it's a super chat

57
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,520
Um, oh, thank you for the congratulations rain. Uh, I have ginger tea. I

58
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,880
Took an anti-nausea pill and we are going to play don't scream

59
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
No, no, no, no, no, no

60
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,280
Now we're gonna add some caveats to this

61
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,440
We're gonna add some caveats to the don't scream for membership

62
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:55,840
If you gift to or more memberships, there is going to be a jump scare sound that will probably scare me

63
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:06,280
One memberships or if you just joined membership will also play a sound which might scare me if you donate or tip

64
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,320
$10 or more you can do text-to-speech, which will also scare the living bhajibra's out of me

65
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
So

66
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
And

67
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,240
And

68
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
So today

69
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,240
We're gonna see

70
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,760
How that works and I don't know why I I don't know why I'm freezing so much. Hold on. I think I know why hold on

71
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,200
Let me adjust some stuff. Okay. There there we go. There we go

72
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Let me just tell you

73
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Senpai I

74
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,040
Suck at horror. I hate jump scares

75
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,240
If I had flight or fight I would have fight and fight usually involves screaming

76
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,840
If

77
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,960
We're gonna try it out if by some chance I cannot do it

78
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,360
Please understand. Oh, thank you, Charlie

79
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,920
Charlie spur for the 10 Mary Seacal high. Can I leave the cage? I promise I won't run

80
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,960
I just want to stretch my legs, please. I promise. I love you. You can move to the bigger cage

81
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,520
If ice for some reason cannot do it

82
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,320
Please understand that. Oh my gosh. What the heck is this bracelet even? Is this sending me like shock shocks? What the heck?

83
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,800
You're ears probably won't die due to how I set up the microphone, but

84
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,440
If I cannot do it and I end up barfing, please understand. Oh

85
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
My gosh

86
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,720
I haven't started yet, I haven't started yet Senpai. Thank you

87
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,640
Thank you so much for your generosity, but also I haven't started yet Senpai

88
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
I

89
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Stop please

90
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,040
Thank you so much finish for 10 whoa

91
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Okay

92
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,920
Well your motion sickness permits you to play the game

93
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,080
I am tripled up as I've said I've tripled up anti nausea pill this thinking this bracelet who I don't know

94
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,520
If it works ginger tea, we're gonna see if it works

95
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,560
And let me tell you I'm not looking forward to this

96
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
What about the glasses

97
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,080
I'll bring out the glasses right now. I don't know where I put my glasses. I

98
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,760
Don't remember. Oh wait, it might be in a drawer. No, so not there

99
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,840
Let me put on my anti-nauseous dorky glasses as well

100
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,560
I don't think they're gonna work Senpai. I don't think my dorky glasses are gonna work

101
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
The liquid evaporated

102
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
The liquid evaporated

103
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
The liquid in the

104
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
The glasses evaporated

105
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,040
They're just dorky glasses now

106
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,600
Isn't it literally in clothes in clothes in the frame frame. Yeah, but it evaporated

107
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,400
It's like how you get the liquid pens and the liquid in the pens evaporated. Yeah, anyways

108
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,680
I'm scared so please be nice to me

109
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,680
Can I leave the cage? I promise I won't run. I just want to stretch my legs. Please sad face

110
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Shit

111
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
This might scare me

112
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I'm just gonna play all of them

113
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840
I can't believe it's resetting

114
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Oh no, oh no

115
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:06,240
Oh no, it's also is this too sensitive now wait, I should I should talk I should talk quietly

116
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Okay, let's see

117
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
That might work

118
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Yeah

119
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,560
Okay, never mind we're gonna do this to 70 we're gonna see if this works at 70. Oh, yeah, we're good

120
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,840
I think this is good enough 70% looks good enough

121
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
Okay, so we're gonna test this out

122
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,880
Maybe I should have made this a little a

123
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Little a little less

124
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Okay, we're all good

125
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Okay, we're gonna test this out, okay

126
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Okay, ready

127
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,400
Okay, the sensitivity is not high enough

128
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,480
See the sensitivity in here versus the game is way different. Oh

129
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Perfect

130
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
We're perfect, we're perfect

131
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Okay, Iki macho

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm not happy

137
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Oh

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
I

139
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Don't play this game

140
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I

141
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880

Just wanted to say that being so nervous on you debut yet going through with it anyway

147
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:45,120
Was genuinely very brave of you not everybody would have done that you've worked really hard and people recognized that and you deserve to

148
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Be proud of yourself

149
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Senpai

150
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Senpai

151
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Senpai

152
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Senpai

153
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Senpai

154
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Senpai

155
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Senpai, I don't want to be here

156
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760

I don't like horror. I don't like horror

160
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Senpai

161
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Senpai

162
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Senpai

163
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760

Senpai

167
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,760
I'm scared, Senpai. I'm so scared

168
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I don't like surprises. The only surprises I like are like catch-up on and

169
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Blind boxes, you know, like the fun surprises. This is not a fun surprise

170
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Merry monetization, Mercy. Please don't die while playing this XT

171
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Ah

172
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I don't want to check up my left

173
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
I don't want to check my left

I thought the taste was rather effervescent and so I thought to myself Wow, this would be a great word of the day

248
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:47,260
Imagine parents having good opsec as they go ham on posting hot takes under their real name on Facebook

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:23,860

254
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,260
It's a great word because I think that

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,260
That

256
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
I think that

257
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:48,260
I don't know it really struck me once when I had a fortune told to me and they're like to get good luck today

258
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:54,260

267
00:36:50,900 --> 00:37:04,800

Sorry, I'm yapping. I'm sorry. I'm yapping

Why is that sign pointing

356
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,940
Why is that why is that sign pointing?

357
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,580
Out of way

01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,700

01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,420
Is it a misdirection?

01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,460
I

372
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,780

Here's the scenario your senpai escaped from your house. He's hiding in the woods

374
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:49,580
He broke his leg jumping from your window. You need to track him down before he escapes for good

375
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,740

01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Sense of direction

394
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:09,500
It's about

395
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,540
Oh

396
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,540
Oh

397
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,340
My shoulders feel like they're up to my ears

398
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:36,140
Is that a vending machine? It's a vending machine, don't you?

399
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,940
Thank you

400
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,940

01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,740
Oh

01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,740
You bitch

403
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,940

01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,140
I can't see some fun. Is that okay? I can't see

405
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,540
I can't see

406
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,540
Jesus fucking

407
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,420
Shit

408
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,780
Oh

409
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,780
Oh

410
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,340
I know you

411
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,780
I know you, and you're evil ways. You're trying to steal my supplies.

412
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,780
Al.

413
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,780
Yes, it called me too.

414
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,780
Objectifying, woman. Objectify the woman.

415
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,780
Objectify the woman. Objectify the woman.

416
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,780
Objectify the woman. Objectify the woman.

417
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:21,780
The woman.

418
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,780
It's just a tree trunk.

419
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,780
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. It's just trees.

420
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:52,780
Give me a layer. Give me a layer. Give me a layer.

421
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,780
Give me a layer. Give me a layer. Give me a layer.

422
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,780
The battery's gone. It's my battery.

423
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,780
Okay. I think it's okay.

424
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,780
Okay.

425
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:54,780
It's okay.

426
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,780
It's okay.

427
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:20,780
Don't flick me.

428
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:26,780
I don't remember.

429
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,780
It's just trees.

430
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,780
Okay.

431
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,780
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

432
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:14,780
It's okay.

433
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:25,780
It's okay.

434
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,780
Oh, I've got a trail.

435
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:39,780
I've got a...

436
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,780
a chin.

437
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,780
No, I stopped. No, batteries.

438
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,780
The fuck are these?

439
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,780
The fuck are these?

440
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,780
The fuck are these?

441
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:50,780
Shut up.

442
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,780
Get away from me.

443
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,780
Look.

444
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,780
Okay.

445
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,780
Lady, stay away from me.

446
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,780
Okay.

447
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,780
Lady?

448
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:22,780
It's scary.

449
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:23,780
I don't like this.

450
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:27,780
I don't like this.

451
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,780
I don't like this.

452
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,780
I don't like this.

453
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,780
I can't look at this.

454
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,780
Let's go this way.

455
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:46,780
She heard that.

456
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,780
Come on.

457
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:55,780
Evan, come on.

458
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,780
Come on.

459
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:57,780
Let's do it.

460
01:14:58,780 --> 01:14:59,780
Okay.

461
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,780
Come on.

462
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,780
Come on.

463
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,780
Come on.

464
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:53,780
Sort of a picture.

465
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,780
Is there a battery?

466
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:58,780
The pie is no battery.

467
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:15,780
No, that's instinct.

468
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,780
It's very odd.

469
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,780
That's instinct.

470
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,780
The sensitivity is very high.

471
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:26,780
Sensitivity is very high.

472
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,780
I am just...

473
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,780
I am just literally swallowing my screens right now.

474
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:35,780
Come on, wait.

475
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,780
Ten more seconds.

476
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,780
Ten more seconds.

477
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:38,780
Ten more seconds.

478
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,780
Ten more seconds.

479
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:40,780
Ten more seconds.

480
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,780
Ten more seconds.

481
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:42,780
Ten more seconds.

482
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:43,780
Come on, come on.

483
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,780
Okay.

484
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:05,780
What now?

485
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,780
Good job.

486
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,780
Done.

487
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,780
Wait, doesn't he just give me congratulations?

488
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:45,780
Wait. What? Is this it over? How come I am still playing? Wait, is this it over?

489
01:17:45,780 --> 01:18:11,780
It's over. It's over. It's over. I did it. I did it. It's over.

490
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:27,780
Honestly, Senpai, I don't know if you heard it. I don't know if you heard it.

491
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:55,780
I don't know if you heard, but I slapped my leg a lot. I slapped the armchair a lot when I got really spooked.

492
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:06,780
The sensitivity is pretty high, I think. It was pretty high. I tested it before Scream.

493
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:15,780
The sensitivity was pretty high. I think Senpai saw when I screamed, and now I just followed my scream.

494
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:42,780
I don't know. The sensitivity in the game is a little weird. I felt like some parts I should have been peeking, but I guess it didn't.

495
01:19:42,780 --> 01:20:02,780
I guess it didn't. There was a close one, but I managed it. I was so proud of Senpai. Senpai was so proud of me.

496
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:10,780
Oh, sorry. Charlie. Thank you for all the donations, Senpai.

497
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:15,780
Sorry, I couldn't respond to them because I tried not to scream.

498
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:22,780
Thank you so much. Also reluctantly saying 440.

499
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:34,780
Is it text-to-speech only when the game is up? Yeah, so that it can spook me, so that it can scare the living Pajeebers out of me.

500
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:46,780
And you know what? It did. It did. It did, and I was like...

501
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:52,780
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted Venus.

502
01:20:52,780 --> 01:21:04,780
Like, let's see. I see you. Daddycorn, I see you bastard. Also, Kauai. You have to do it alone in your room with the door closed and the lights off.

503
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,780
Okay.

504
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:29,780
You have no idea. Sperdedly, throughout the stream. Papa. I could hear the spoon. Papa. I think it was Papa. Papa Mercy was using, and I was like...

505
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:31,780
Oh.

506
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:42,780
That was my motion sickness. It's okay, but when I started moving the camera, I was like, oh, okay.

507
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:48,780
Well, I'm feeling a bit dizzy and a sense of vertical, but not so much as like...

508
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:53,780
I don't feel like... I don't know. It seems like it was working.

509
01:21:54,780 --> 01:22:06,780
I think... I think the bracelet worked. Like, I didn't throw up. I just felt... I felt nauseous, but I didn't throw up.

510
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:13,780
Are we getting shocks? I just turned it off, but it did shock me throughout, so I was like, okay. Okay. Focus.

511
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:21,780
I was kind of cheating. I was kind of cheating. So, I was like, when it shocks me, focus on that. Focus on that. Focus on that.

512
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:36,780
Oof. Okay, hold on. I put some like, conductive gel on so that it would work better. I'm not sure if it worked, but I think it did. I think it did.

513
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:46,780
I think it did. Oh, man. I did it.

514
01:22:47,780 --> 01:23:02,780
Shocks from this... Well, it didn't feel like shocks. It's more like buzzing. I'm wearing this motion sickness anti-nausea watch bracelet, bracelet thing.

515
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:08,780
It's called Emitter. E-M-E-T-E-R-M.

516
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:14,780
It's for this. Heart rate monitor next time.

517
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:29,780
Honestly, I don't know what kind of heart rate monitor I need. I need to do some research for that.

518
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:44,780
You think it helped? I think so? I'm not sure. I mean, I didn't throw up, but we'll have to test this again, Senpai. We're going to have to test this again.

519
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:53,780
Mind you, I was tripling up on my motion sickness stuff, so I had my ginger tea.

520
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:04,780
There will be a next time. Of course there'll be a next time. Not for this. Not for this. Not for this, though.

521
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:22,780
There's history with me and Daddy Korn. We keep finding each other in different B-Tuber chats. It's like the fifth or sixth time we've found each other in LL.

522
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:26,780
True love?

523
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:50,780
Ginger tea helps with my motion sickness. Ginger in general helps with nausea.

524
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,780
Nausea and throw yuppie.

525
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,780
Are you traumatized, Kohai?

526
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:12,780
Yes? That was cheap. That was really cheap at the end. What the heck? At the end where they had another lady pull up. That was so cheap.

527
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:16,780
Man.

528
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:24,780
I show up at the cages. Senpai, I fool up.

529
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:36,780
I was so mad.

530
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:44,780
Oh my gosh, Johnny. Oh my gosh, I just woke up from a nap with a banging headache. Congrats, Mercy. We love you.

531
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,780
I love you too. Good.

532
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:56,780
I beat the game, I think. That was so cheap. That was so cheap. At the bottom, I was like...

533
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:03,780
But there was a lot of times where I swallowed my scream. I swallowed my scream. I only screamed once.

534
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:15,780
But I actually screamed many times. I think at odd times. I actually screamed, but I swallowed it.

535
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:26,780
Oh man, the sounds did not help. The sounds did not help.

536
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,780
The sounds did not help.

537
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,780
I eat to this. I eat to the end when...

538
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:47,780
The sounds were the scariest parts. Yes, I was so scared.

539
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:56,780
Hey, Johnny, did you know Mercy's gonna be swallowing? Swallowing my screams?

540
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:03,780
I remember he made chicken noises. That's because someone said, are you a chicken, Mercy?

541
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:07,780
And I said yes, and I started balking and clucking.

542
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:14,780
Can you use the 3DO next time? Ambient whimpering sounds?

543
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,780
But I thought birds weren't real.

544
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:32,780
Yeah, I got a glass of water and come back to swallowing. You guys can admit it. I hired good.

545
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:44,780
Marcherary assistance. Uh, scared yandere ASMR. I'm scared of other things.

546
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:53,780
But when I'm... I get tunnel vision, Senpai. I get tunnel vision.

547
01:27:55,780 --> 01:28:02,780
I get really, really bad tunnel vision, so when I'm like really pissed, all I can see is red.

548
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:08,780
And that's how I, like, run.

549
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:26,780
I remember, um, I think Shibi said I'm hiding my power level from you guys, and I'm just like, oh, yeah, I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit hiding it.

550
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:35,780
I, with the power, I think it's funny, but like, I was like, Senpai, Senpai, please help me. Senpai, Senpai!

551
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:45,780
The 2D games be easier on your emotions like this? 2D games usually are, except for some games.

552
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:53,780
Um, some gay, okay, actress. Shut up. I'm not...

553
01:28:55,780 --> 01:29:03,780
I know there's a lot of part where I'm acting, but I'm trying to be really, really kind to Senpais and not really go on Menhera.

554
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:11,780
You have no idea. I went, like, strongy had to be like, they're there, they're there, Mercy, they're there.

555
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:30,780
Because I'm trying not to be that bad.

556
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:38,780
Any chance we can get you to try some 2D horror games if they spook you less than 3D ones?

557
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:44,780
Will you go full Menhera one day? Um, I will probably...

558
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:50,780
I will probably let it slip.

559
01:29:56,780 --> 01:30:01,780
I will probably let it slip one day. I really try my best to, to...

560
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:08,780
I know, I know people want to see it, but I'm trying my best to, to be...

561
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,780
to be...

562
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:24,780
Oh my gosh! Thank you, Sheldon Zero, for 50 gifts!

563
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:28,780
Holy, holy moly.

564
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:38,780
We love our Menhera, too, Bruce.

565
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:52,780
You have no idea. Before stream, um, well, I went out to, to, to, to, um, to get some ASMR stuff as well,

566
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:58,780
because I was like, okay, well, if, I'd like to do a, do a hand cam for my membership,

567
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:03,780
and then I was looking at my arm before stream, and I was like, I don't think I can do it.

568
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:07,780
I don't think I can do it, because my, my arm is so red.

569
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:11,780
My arm is so red. It's beyond...

570
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:17,780
It is, like, really, really, like, itchy and gross.

571
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:23,780
It's itchy, gross, uh...

572
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:35,780
Really bumpy as well, so, and, like, kind of looks, kind of, and, like, looks really bad,

573
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:41,780
so it's not flaky, but it's, like, bumpy, bumpy everywhere, and, like, super red,

574
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:46,780
so I, I was worried that if I did, if I did a hand cam stream,

575
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:51,780
that some pies would be worried with it.

576
01:31:54,780 --> 01:32:00,780
It can't be, it's like, it was, like, bleeding, too, so I was worried that, uh...

577
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,780
Do you need to see a doctor for it?

578
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:07,780
I'm going to see if it goes away by Saturday, and if it doesn't go away by Saturday.

579
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:08,780
Um...

580
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:13,780
It's... I'm going to go to the doctor.

581
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:19,780
Bleeding, it's because it started to, um...

582
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:24,780
I scratched it a little bit, and then it got caught, I guess.

583
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:29,780
So I, the entire stream, I'm wearing this, uh...

584
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:36,780
This compass, this, like, arm, arm compass thing, and as well as, uh...

585
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:40,780
You're going to wrap your arms in bandages just like your model has?

586
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:45,780
I didn't have time to go out and buy bandages, and also, um...

587
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:49,780
I was worried because the compress didn't work for a while,

588
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:55,780
that it would become more inflamed, inflamed, uh...

589
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:01,780
if it was stuck under bandages and due to the friction, so I, um...

590
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:05,780
put it, put on a lot of ice, like, a lot of, uh, ice,

591
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:12,780
and you can feel, if I was here, um, if Senpai was here, you can touch my arm,

592
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:17,780
and you can feel, like, really, like, heat radiating out of it.

593
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:23,780
I think it's just an allergy thing. I don't think it's eczema.

594
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:30,780
It's a, it's a, it's a allergy thing. I probably touched...

595
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:35,780
touched, um, touched egg or something.

596
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:53,780
But, yeah, that's why I was, I opted for not to do a hand cam,

597
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:57,780
but I'll, I'll make it up. I'll make it up to Senpai.

598
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:07,780
Gloves? Uh, I'm wearing an arm sleeve right now that has, like, gloves.

599
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:10,780
Did you accidentally ingest an egg product?

600
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:15,780
No, I think this is, uh, if I ingested, it would be a completely different reaction,

601
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,780
and I wouldn't be able to breathe.

602
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:20,780
Uh, this one is touching. I'm pretty sure it's just touching.

603
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,780
Hold on, are you allergic to latex?

604
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,780
I don't have it.

605
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:28,780
Hold on, are you allergic to latex?

606
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:36,780
I don't have any latex on my bed, so when I woke up, it was on my bed, so...

607
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:39,780
or, like, something I bumped into earlier in the day.

608
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:47,780
I, I, last night, I showered because it was, like, really bad,

609
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:52,780
and I'm probably gonna have to ice it after stream again.

610
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:53,780
Bed bugs? No.

611
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:57,780
If it was bed bugs, it would look like bug bites.

612
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,780
This is definitely, like, hive slash rash.

613
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:09,780
It was a shower lesson link. I had it before the shower.

614
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,780
I wanted to make sure that it was washed.

615
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:15,780
Whatever residue was on my arm was washed off as well.

616
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:21,780
Um, it was washed off, and it's just...

617
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:26,780
This happens sometimes. It rarely happens to me, but...

618
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:30,780
it happens.

619
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:41,780
It, it doesn't happen often, but this sometimes happens.

620
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:44,780
Sometimes it just pops out of nowhere.

621
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,780
Honestly, it's, I've seen this happen before,

622
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:51,780
and it usually takes a few days to, to clear up,

623
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:55,780
but unfortunately, Senpai, um...

624
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:59,780
it just happened to have appeared yesterday,

625
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:02,780
and just, and all the way to today,

626
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:05,780
which is really, really sad.

627
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:10,780
I took some Benadryl, too, and when I took Benadryl,

628
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:13,780
the inflammation went down a little bit as well.

629
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:16,780
I put on, like, uh...

630
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:19,780
some lotion as well, so it's good.

631
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:23,780
Did it start as a little weird little bump skull hive?

632
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:27,780
It started out, like, basically kind of like this, like a rash.

633
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,780
Could it be from stress?

634
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:35,780
It could be stress. It's just on, it's on my, um...

635
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,780
it's just on my right arm, which is unfortunate,

636
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:41,780
because it's my, as this happened before, I think so.

637
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:44,780
I think it's happened before.

638
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:47,780
The universe just didn't want to see a hand cam.

639
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:50,780
It happens. Oh!

640
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:53,780
One time, Senpai's.

641
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:56,780
This is really funny.

642
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:59,780
Um...

643
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,780
One time, I was gonna play League.

644
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:04,780
I was gonna try to play League.

645
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:08,780
So the day I set up a whole thing about, like, uh...

646
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,780
League,

647
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:16,780
and then my body rejected League.

648
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:18,780
It rejected it.

649
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:22,780
I got sick for three months so badly.

650
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:26,780
Like, the day...

651
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:31,780
the day I was going to play League for the first time,

652
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:35,780
I got so terribly ill.

653
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,780
Three months, yeah.

654
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,780
Uh, I don't know what happened, really.

655
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:49,780
I took a test for COVID,

656
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,780
and it went out negative,

657
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:56,780
but I also had symptoms of asthma, asthma symptoms,

658
01:37:56,780 --> 01:38:01,780
and I was throwing up a lot, like, a lot,

659
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:03,780
and I got a lot...

660
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:07,780
I got intermittent fevers, and it lasted for, like, three months.

661
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,780
I was like...

662
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:15,780
I was like, oh, my God!

663
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,780
The world just...

664
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:22,780
My immune system just did not want me to play League.

665
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:26,780
I blame League because it was the day,

666
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:31,780
the day I was gonna play League that it happened.

667
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,780
Like, I'm so toxic.

668
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:40,780
I...

669
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:42,780
I'm so glad I'm not sick like that anymore

670
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:44,780
because, um,

671
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:48,780
I actually lost my voice for the first time.

672
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:50,780
I don't know why.

673
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:53,780
I don't know why that happened.

674
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:55,780
I just thought it was really funny,

675
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:58,780
so I took that as a sign not to play League.

676
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,780
I took that as a sign not to play League

677
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:03,780
because, um...

678
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:06,780
I actually lost my voice for a little bit, too,

679
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,780
so I...

680
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:10,780
So, people just can...

681
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,780
just hear, like,

682
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:14,780
step by step by.

683
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:16,780
Ha ha ha!

684
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,780
That was such a huge coincidence.

685
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:32,780
It was such a...

686
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:35,780
a major coincidence.

687
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:39,780
Maybe the arm rash is a reaction to another game.

688
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:42,780
I just... I'm taking this as a...

689
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,780
I'm taking this as a sign

690
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:48,780
to... to get...

691
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,780
to wait a little bit

692
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:54,780
to do, like, a hand cam or something for some pies.

693
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,780
I don't know why.

694
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:05,780
The universe is a little silly thing.

695
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:07,780
Honestly, um, I felt really bad

696
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:11,780
because I had planned all around, like, a hand cam and everything,

697
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:14,780
but, uh, I think this was okay, too. This was okay.

698
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:18,780
Thank you so much for joining me on my membership opening day, as well.

699
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:20,780
I'm so happy.

700
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:28,780
Because, like, I want to be at my best health for some pies

701
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:30,780
to do a, um...

702
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,780
to do a hand cam.

703
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:35,780
And if... and I really think

704
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:39,780
some pies would just really...

705
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,780
really, uh...

706
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,780
really...

707
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:47,780
hate how...

708
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:50,780
and be, like, super worried about how red and bumpy it is.

709
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:53,780
Like, you can even see the bumps through the... the sleeve.

710
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:56,780
The, like, a little compression sleeve.

711
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:07,780
Any other plans for membership stuff you can tell us about?

712
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:10,780
I'm actually still in the middle of planning some membership stuff.

713
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:15,780
Because, um, I've never had membership before, so...

714
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:18,780
and I've never membered to anyone before.

715
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:21,780
So I'm gonna see...

716
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:23,780
and I'm gonna see if Strawny...

717
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:26,780
Strawny will, like, um...

718
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,780
help as well. Help out with things.

719
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:30,780
Ah! Azura!

720
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:35,780
I can't leave you... leave you yet.

721
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:38,780
Some pies don't want... doesn't want me to leave.

722
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:41,780
What do you need, uh, Strawny?

723
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:44,780
It's like, oh, I was hoping Strawny could help me with, like...

724
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:47,780
Strawny, I meant to be, like, uh...

725
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:49,780
I was hoping you can... you can help me with...

726
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:52,780
think of, like, membership stream ideas.

727
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,780
Oh, my gosh!

728
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:00,780
Azura!

729
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:14,780
Azura!

730
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:16,780
What am I even doing?

731
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:29,780
Oh, my gosh!

732
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,780
Serenity!

733
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,780
What the heck?

734
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,780
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

735
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:39,780
Thank you, everyone, for the raid!

736
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,780
Thank you!

01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:53,780

740
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:57,780
Up!

741
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:03,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:20,780
Yep, did what the hecky-wecky.

747
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,780
Oh, my goodness.

748
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,780
Oh, my golly, gee, will occurs as...

749
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:31,780

750
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:38,020
Oh my gosh, thank you! Everyone has been so kind and generous, thank you!

751
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,100
Hahahahaha!

752
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:49,220
Thank you so much, I'm so happy.

753
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:54,180
Hahahahaha! That's singing earlier, Mariah Mercy.

754
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,180
Hahahahaha!

755
01:43:57,060 --> 01:44:03,300
I'm not, I'm actually pretty excited but also pretty nervous about the karaoke stream

756
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:08,420
because I'm gonna be singing in front of so many people and I'm not even gonna,

757
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:15,380
I'm not gonna, I'm not even gonna, I think I'll just get a little bit of stage fright.

758
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,780
I think I'm gonna get a bit of stage fright.

759
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:22,100
Hahahahaha!

760
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:30,260
Honestly, honestly, I'm so thankful everyone, I'm so thankful, I'm honestly super, super thankful.

761
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:41,700
Yeah, wait to hear you sing, I'm sure you do so well, thank you Azura! I don't think I'm as good,

762
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:49,060
I think I'm pretty average, like not terrible but not amazing, but I'm practicing,

763
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:54,820
I'm practicing. I want to be the Arrow Idol you, you can love and enjoy.

764
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,060
I really,

765
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:13,060
guys she's being humble, her singing is cute, no, no, no, I'm honest, I'm honest to gosh.

766
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:21,860
I'm really hyped to see my song choices, you, my song choices, probably not the greatest.

767
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:42,580
Oh my goodness! Thank you Lily Lycodes for 20, what the, no, oh, oh, I don't know how to,

768
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:51,300
I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie senpai's, I am flabbergasted, flabbergasted

769
01:45:53,060 --> 01:46:04,100
about all these, all these gifted, gifted member memes, memes, memes? I was gonna say subs because

770
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:09,540
brain rot but gifted members, membership.

771
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:24,180
I am, honestly I am so glad to be here, to be part of VLR, I know that it might be frustrating

772
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:32,660
that I, I'm a very slow person but this is, this is like the first time I've had so many eyes on me.

773
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:42,020
You know, this is the first time I've had so many eyes on me and so many kind people,

774
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:50,900
just be, just be super, super, super nice. I hope, can I, can I get sappy a little bit, can I get sappy?

775
01:46:51,700 --> 01:47:07,060
Um, sappy, everyone? Like I feel so welcome at VLR, I get, I was so excited to meet you senpai,

776
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:14,660
like honestly, honestly, I'm so, so excited to meet my senpais, like I'm, okay, I'm gonna

777
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:22,420
just admit it, I do stalk, I do stalk my senpais, wait a bit. Now that Twitter likes are turned off,

778
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:26,660
I can't, I can't, it's harder to stalk you.

779
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:42,340
But sometimes I go, if you're on Twitter or something, I go into and I'll be like, oh you

780
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:48,740
have two cats, what's your cat's name? What are you into? Oh, you'll, you live in, I don't know,

781
01:47:48,740 --> 01:47:54,340
so-and-so place, how interesting, how interesting, oh your weather there is like this, how interesting,

782
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,860
you have a sister, how interesting.

783
01:47:56,740 --> 01:48:11,380
Oh my goodness, thank you, default for 10 as well, oh my goodness.

784
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:21,380
Don't worry, I, I notice, I notice all my senpais.

785
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:31,460
I, I try to hide the minhara a little bit

786
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:40,740
because I feel like it's, sometimes I just want to make you happy, I just want to make you happy

787
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:47,700
and I don't want to, to pull you down by, by being super minhara.

788
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:52,420
Don't hide it from me please.

789
01:48:56,740 --> 01:49:04,900
Yeah, I mean like, I, I try my best to show my best, my best face here, behind closed doors, I,

790
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:13,540
I'm, I'm not, I'm very much a little bit of a, of a creep.

791
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:25,460
I know minhara is part of the experience, but I don't know, I think I feel like having

792
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:36,580
a minhara breakdown in front of everyone is just not great, so I do it, off stream.

793
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:53,460
Like, oh my gosh, I, I branded and like cried to my, to my gen,

794
01:49:54,180 --> 01:50:00,020
gen mates because of just how, how meadow, meadow illinois.

795
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:01,700
I am.

796
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:13,380
You look like the most sane member of VLOR so far.

797
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,020
You guys like higurashi?

798
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:22,580
You guys like higurashi?

799
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:26,660
Think about re, rena.

800
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:30,100
Okay, you know how she's kind of sweet at the beginning?

801
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:32,340
And then the itch happens.

802
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,580
And then everything goes to heck.

803
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:42,340
Um, right now I'm in the, that, that, the, the early parts.

804
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:59,300
I'm like at the early parts where she's very kind and she's very, you know, loving.

805
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,580
I'm at that part right now.

806
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:12,020
I'm at that part right now, like I've,

807
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:19,460
I'm at that part right now, so I'm trying my best to hold it back.

808
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:26,340
No, no, no, no, I, I really mean it.

809
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:31,220
I'm, I'm holding myself back, honestly, honestly, honestly.

810
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:39,620
Honestly, I'm trying to hold myself back simply because I really, I really, I really want

811
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:46,580
to be at my best and, and senpais.

812
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:51,220
I know, I know you're like, oh my gosh, let's make her worse.

813
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:55,220
Menhera, she's going to be so great when she has that Menhera breakdown.

814
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:56,420
It's going to be, I don't think so.

815
01:51:56,420 --> 01:52:01,460
I think when you see that Menhera breakdown, you're going to just be worried.

816
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:04,100
You're just going to be worried.

817
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:14,740
You're going to be concerned and worried.

818
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:28,900
So yeah, I, I want to be me and the me that I want to be is,

819
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:36,020
it might slip, it might slip, but most of the time please understand

820
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:37,220
I will be in dairy mode.

821
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:39,060
I will be in dairy mode

822
01:52:44,980 --> 01:52:47,060
because I am so in love.

823
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:47,780
I'm so in love.

824
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:51,460
Legitimately, I will stalk you.

825
01:52:52,340 --> 01:53:00,820
I, I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say, actually, you know what?

826
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:02,660
Secret, this is a secret.

827
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:08,420
This is a secret.

828
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:12,900
This is a secret.

829
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:24,100
Yeah, I, the Menhera will come out.

830
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:26,260
Don't worry.

831
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:35,460
You, you don't like secrets?

832
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:41,780
Nah, no.

833
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:45,540
I want to keep senpais on their toes.

834
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,500
I'll keep senpais on their toes.

835
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:55,060
You can't keep secrets from senpais.

836
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:56,980
What if it's a surprise?

837
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:10,740
It's a surprise.

838
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:13,140
You already cut off all my toes?

839
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,140
I'll keep you on your heels.

840
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:35,620
Only if we get to stalk you back?

841
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:39,380
No, stalking is a one-way street and it's my street.

842
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:58,660
Senpais, please understand, it is mine, mine, and mine alone.

843
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:08,660
Okay.

844
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:27,940
No, seriously.

845
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:40,820
Why, senpai, senpais, settle down, settle down, senpai, settle down.

846
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:46,420
Settle down, senpai.

847
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:49,540
You're okay.

848
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:54,420
The surprise is for you to wait for.

849
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:56,420
Okay.

850
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,420
Why do you cut another girl stalking us?

851
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:12,580
Maybe both of you need to go.

852
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:20,740
Settle down, that's it.

853
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:28,500
What's in the syringe, Kohai?

854
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:36,980
Don't worry, it's a surprise.

855
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:44,580
Mmm, I want senpais to see all facets of me, but for now, please have this.

856
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:50,100
Please view me as your adorable Kohai, okay?

857
01:56:50,740 --> 01:57:17,860
And always remember that I am so, so, so understanding and that you are my,

858
01:57:18,820 --> 01:57:20,020
you are mine.

859
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:26,180
When you speak like this, I can't refuse.

860
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:29,460
I feel like that's like a serious voice.

861
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:34,260
I feel like if I, if I want to capture your attention, I have to, I have to,

862
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:38,100
I have to talk in my serious voice.

863
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,140
My serious voice.

864
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:42,020
Just like Nyan Tataro said.

865
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:51,620
Let's check out my schedule.

866
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:55,540
I'm so very thankful.

867
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:56,180
Oh, right.

868
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:58,180
I didn't, I was, I went off track.

869
01:57:58,180 --> 01:57:59,540
I went off track, senpai.

870
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:02,340
I went off track.

871
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:06,900
I was about to say, I was going to say Nyan Tataro coming back soon, probably not.

872
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:11,300
How many more voices, how many voices do you have?

873
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:14,500
It depends on the situation, what kind of voice I use.

874
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:17,220
Like my phone voice is, hello?

875
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:20,100
Hello, yes?

876
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:25,140
I'm calling about my internet service provider.

877
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:26,340
My provider?

878
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:29,540
Yeah, my internet is down right now.

879
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:30,020
Can I?

880
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:32,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

881
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:32,900
That's fine.

882
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:33,220
Thank you.

883
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:33,540
Thank you.

884
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,580
Yeah, that's no problem at all.

885
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:41,620
Yes, yes, yes.

886
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,100
That's fine.

887
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:49,140
Yes, that's fine, yes.

888
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:55,540
Please, yes, I need my internet.

889
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:56,580
I need my internet.

890
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:59,460
It's very important that I hire internet as soon as possible.

891
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:01,540
Yes, I understand, I understand.

892
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:04,340
But please, can I have some?

893
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:08,900
I'm only being provided four, four up and four down

894
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:10,660
when it should be at least 50.

895
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:17,620
That is like the phone voice.

896
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:18,420
It depends.

897
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:21,780
Or if I'm talking to someone, I, like, you know,

898
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:26,260
like maybe someone like a, like a, like my doctor, I'm like, yeah.

899
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:31,380
So I've been feeling a bit of stomach issues.

900
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:35,060
And, and I have some throat issues.

901
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:38,340
Is there anything that we can do to alleviate it?

902
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:43,780
And then, then you know, your stage voice.

903
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:44,980
Welcome, everyone.

904
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:49,300
Welcome, welcome to Mercy Modi's show.

905
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:54,020
Today we will provide you with an excellent service with,

906
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:58,260
I don't know, catering and blah, blah, blah, you know, things like that.

907
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:02,660
Everyone has a different voice for a different situation.

908
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:05,700
And it happens that when I get a little serious

909
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:07,540
or I want you to calm down or pay attention,

910
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:09,940
it's like, listen here, okay.

911
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:15,780
Okay, listen up.

912
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:21,460
But they're all facets of me.

913
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:23,700
Therefore, all facets of me.

914
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:35,620
They're all facets of different versions of,

915
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:43,060
of when, you know, you, you want to command a different sort of attention

916
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:44,100
depending on the voices.

917
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:51,300
So for example, you know, if you're like talking to a kid,

918
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:52,500
it's completely different, right?

919
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:55,620
You're like, oh, sweetie, are you lost?

920
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:56,500
Where's your mommy?

921
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:58,420
You know, something like that.

922
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:04,180
Something like that.

923
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:06,100
Compared to when you talk to an adult, right?

924
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:12,900
Or if you talk to your dog or your pet, aren't you so cute?

925
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:14,340
Come here, come here now.

926
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:16,180
Come here, come here.

927
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:18,100
Good boy, good boy.

928
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:38,100
I think, I think that's, when you say I have different voices,

929
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:39,140
it's still all me.

930
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:44,100
Just a different, I pick a different type of voice to use all the time.

931
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:48,580
Yeah, my real voice is this though.

932
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:52,500
I feel like, how many members do I have?

933
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:54,340
I don't know.

934
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:55,060
How can I tell?

935
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:59,460
I don't know how to tell some pie.

936
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:00,980
Oh, right.

937
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:07,140
I didn't know you had a mommy voice.

938
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:20,180
I don't want to steal Azra's part, but I guess the mommy voice would be like,

939
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:25,060
I guess if I had to do a mommy voice, actually, it would probably be like,

940
02:02:26,580 --> 02:02:27,700
What's up, Eve?

941
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:29,060
Do you want a piece?

942
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:30,420
You want a piece?

943
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:31,540
You want a piece?

944
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:32,820
Okay, okay.

945
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:33,380
Are you ready?

946
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:38,420
Hold on, let me move the microphone to make this sound realistic.

947
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:40,420
There you go.

948
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:41,860
Look how high you are.

949
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:43,140
You're so great.

950
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:46,100
Whoosh, and back down again.

951
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:49,780
Something like that.

952
02:02:50,420 --> 02:03:08,420
I don't want to, I don't want to, that's Azra's thing.

953
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,020
That's Azra's thing.

954
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:14,820
So if you want like the mommy experience, that's Azra.

955
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:16,340
But I can do like the occasional,

956
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:20,660
um, mommy-ish voice.

957
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:22,100
Sounds like a more like a babysitter.

958
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:23,780
I failed.

959
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:24,180
I failed.

960
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:26,980
See, this is why Azra's the master.

961
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:30,980
This is why Azra's the master at being the motherly,

962
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:35,860
motherly figure, and I am just mercy.

963
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:42,420
Melfi Henry ASMR when honey.

964
02:03:43,780 --> 02:03:44,340
Wait, no, no.

965
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:45,220
Hold on.

966
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,940
Sweetie, you're kind of catching cold.

967
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:49,220
Wear this.

968
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:51,860
Wait, is that a lipstick mark?

969
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:54,020
Who the fuck was this from?

970
02:03:54,020 --> 02:04:15,540
Damn, I sound like an aunt instead of a mommy.

971
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:16,580
This is rude.

972
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:17,380
This is rude.

973
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:24,260
I sound like an aunt.

974
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:26,020
Oh my gosh, I failed.

975
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:30,020
I failed at my attempting a mommy voice.

976
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:30,660
That's fine.

977
02:04:30,660 --> 02:04:31,140
That's fine.

978
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:33,620
It's not, it's not who I was meant to be.

979
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:35,060
It's not what I was meant to do.

980
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:41,540
The voice you did in the trailer

981
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:45,140
sounds like a completely different person.

982
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:54,020
I think when I recorded it, I think that's just how the editor did it.

983
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:58,340
I think that's just how the editor did it.

984
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:01,940
What better way?

985
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:02,420
I don't know.

986
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:04,500
What better way?

987
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,140
I don't remember my lines.

988
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:13,140
Fear is a top shelf ad-redeasy.

989
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:26,980
I don't know.

990
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:27,380
I don't know.

991
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:28,580
Did it sound like that?

992
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:31,700
I don't know.

993
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:33,700
Maybe I did a voice by accident.

994
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:34,580
I get nervous.

995
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:35,380
I get nervous.

996
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:40,580
I get nervous and I'm just like, okay, okay, I'll do the voice.

997
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:51,380
I was probably also not as cheerful and probably was like, oh my gosh, I'm extra nervous.

998
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:55,300
Mercy is an auntie.

999
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:02,820
Technically, I would be called an aunt and like,

1000
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:07,860
depending on like family relation stuff.

1001
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:10,820
Even if they're older than me.

1002
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:17,140
I can't believe I sound like an aunt instead of mom.

1003
02:06:17,860 --> 02:06:18,980
See, this is why.

1004
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:19,700
This is why.

1005
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:20,900
This is why I can't do it.

1006
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:27,460
If you were nervous, you didn't sound nervous.

1007
02:06:31,700 --> 02:06:33,060
I was probably more nervous.

1008
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:40,100
When I'm nervous, I guess, I don't know.

1009
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:41,860
I don't know what happens.

1010
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:43,620
My brain just turns off and just goes, go.

1011
02:06:51,620 --> 02:06:54,100
If you collab with Azura, I could play the aunt role.

1012
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:58,420
I'm not just a regular aunt.

1013
02:06:58,420 --> 02:06:59,700
I'm a cool aunt.

1014
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:08,980
You have no idea, Senpai.

1015
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:14,580
When I'm, I used to be so nervous that I would just like,

1016
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:17,380
I would be like shaking.

1017
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:22,580
But I guess I was still kind of nervous then too.

1018
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:25,940
Yeah, I feel like I disappointed people.

1019
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:27,460
I feel like I disappointed people.

1020
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:35,860
But Senpai's when, when I, when those audios released.

1021
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:38,420
I feel like I disappointed Senpai's.

1022
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:40,980
And then Senpai's came here and then they heard this.

1023
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:43,700
And they're like, she sucks.

1024
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:44,500
I hate her.

1025
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:46,660
Throw hammers at her.

1026
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:49,140
Let's kill her with hammers.

1027
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:58,020
What, no?

1028
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:04,740
Oh, I meant like, I feel like I disappointed everyone

1029
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:08,420
because it's not, it's not like, that's not regular.

1030
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:12,820
That's not like my regular voice.

1031
02:08:13,700 --> 02:08:18,580
This isn't my wheel.

1032
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:20,180
My wheel.

1033
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:24,020
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1034
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:25,220
It's a little hard.

1035
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:39,780
I'm, I definitely feel like it's still a dream that I'm here.

1036
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:45,780
I guess.

1037
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:51,780
It still feels like a dream that I'm here.

1038
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:52,980
I'm very happy to be here.

1039
02:08:57,540 --> 02:08:58,900
I'm so happy to be here.

1040
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:02,500
I, it's the most fun I've had in a long time.

1041
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:11,220
I feel like the scenario, oh, speaking of,

1042
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:15,060
did anyone listen to the Patreon audio?

1043
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:24,340
I think I just want to say that I think the current Patreon audio

1044
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:29,300
is the one, it's my very first one I recorded.

1045
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:32,500
It's the very first one I recorded.

1046
02:09:34,820 --> 02:09:37,620
So I was definitely very nervous for that one.

1047
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:47,220
I was very nervous for that one.

1048
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:59,780
And when I did that one, after I, I sent it, sent it to,

1049
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:01,540
to management to be like, okay, here you go.

1050
02:10:02,180 --> 02:10:08,420
I was like, I, this is so fun.

1051
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:09,620
This is so fun.

1052
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:10,820
I love this so much.

1053
02:10:12,980 --> 02:10:18,980
I honestly was like, oh, this is such great fun.

1054
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:20,820
I'm, I love this.

1055
02:10:20,820 --> 02:10:29,620
I'm so happy that, that I can do this on the regular.

1056
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:34,340
And I was just like, that was when I was like, yeah,

1057
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:36,740
I belong in Bealer.

1058
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:37,860
I do, I do.

1059
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:43,540
But then I question it sometimes, because that,

1060
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:45,060
then you have imposter syndrome, right?

1061
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:59,780
But then it's in waivers and shakes a little.

1062
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:04,180
But no, I'm glad.

1063
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:04,740
Oh, shit.

1064
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:08,740
I meant to tell you the story of like, like being a little sappy.

1065
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:10,500
I'm, thank you.

1066
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:18,660
I'm so thankful that I have monetization and that I could,

1067
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:23,220
there's a possibility I could do this full time,

1068
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:25,540
because I want to tell some pies.

1069
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:27,060
I want to tell some pies.

1070
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:32,580
I know this sounds, this may sound weird and stuff,

1071
02:11:33,540 --> 02:11:33,780
but

1072
02:11:36,580 --> 02:11:39,940
Papa, before, before, before I was born,

1073
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:43,140
before I was born,

1074
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:50,900
Papa Mercy used to live outside of a car, out of a cardboard box.

1075
02:11:56,020 --> 02:12:00,340
And so, and for Christmas and stuff,

1076
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:04,740
Christmas is and stuff, I would have a,

1077
02:12:08,820 --> 02:12:09,540
I would have,

1078
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:17,620
yeah, before he came, he came here, he used to live in a cardboard box

1079
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:19,540
and he made his way up.

1080
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:27,380
And then most of my life we were still not a, not quite in, in like a very,

1081
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:30,420
very good, good situation.

1082
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:36,980
So growing up, it was, it was like, gifts were like donation gifts and stuff,

1083
02:12:36,980 --> 02:12:42,500
and clothes were, were donated, or donated, and

1084
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:54,420
so being able to be here, be here, have, having,

1085
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:58,420
spending money, a bit of spending money, and

1086
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:07,300
making my way, using, working my, working my butt off to buy this,

1087
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:08,900
this streaming setup and stuff.

1088
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:10,660
I'm so glad it paid off.

1089
02:13:10,660 --> 02:13:15,940
I'm so, so, so glad it paid off, and that my dreams have come true,

1090
02:13:15,940 --> 02:13:24,020
and that, that I got to meet my senpais, and I'm so, so, so happy,

1091
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:24,580
so happy.

1092
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:28,740
I'm so happy

1093
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:33,140
that I'm here.

1094
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:39,460
So thank you so much for all the generosity and all the kindness,

1095
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:43,380
senpais have shown me, I truly, truly, truly, truly appreciate it.

1096
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,180
Like honestly,

1097
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:51,460
can you, can I write equipments off in taxes?

1098
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:55,860
These are over, like, these are years, years old.

1099
02:13:55,860 --> 02:13:57,060
These are years old.

1100
02:13:59,380 --> 02:14:04,340
So I'm glad that I can actually put them to full, full, full use,

1101
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:07,780
full use for my senpais.

1102
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:10,820
I'm so happy.

1103
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:14,020
Thank you.

1104
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:18,420
Thank you for the dollar, Logan.

1105
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:24,580
Ago, you're all worth all this, and way, way more mercy.

1106
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:28,660
I wish we had the resources to give you what you actually deserve.

1107
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:31,380
It's okay senpai, it's okay, it's okay.

1108
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:45,220
Being here, and being, you know, being here, and talking,

1109
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:50,340
and entertaining everyone is our, is my favorite thing to do.

1110
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:54,820
Honestly, and when I get off stream, sometimes I go, I miss them.

1111
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:03,620
What's your type of senpai if you don't mind me asking?

1112
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:05,380
Kind?

1113
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:09,780
My favorite senpai is someone who is kind.

1114
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:22,180
And I think that applies to all of you.

1115
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:31,220
Ellen Meij, her favorite senpai is a slow runner.

1116
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:44,660
Well, I can't seem to argue that either.

1117
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:50,500
I can't argue that either.

1118
02:15:52,180 --> 02:15:53,220
Oops, you caught me.

1119
02:16:02,660 --> 02:16:04,420
Kind, loyal, and won't run, right.

1120
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:05,780
Okay, correct.

1121
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:08,500
Thank you for the 420.

1122
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:11,780
Congratulations on monetization.

1123
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:14,980
You're literally the only Meiju I've ever seen play Harvester.

1124
02:16:16,180 --> 02:16:21,300
Stay based, hope to see you play more obscure indie slash old plot

1125
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:22,900
heavy games.

1126
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:24,260
You're the best go-high ever.

1127
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:25,700
Thank you, Nick Foggy.

1128
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:28,900
How do I say this?

1129
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:33,700
I don't think Harvester is very obscure.

1130
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:36,420
I think Harvester is quite well known.

1131
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:41,540
I just don't think a lot of VTubers play point and clicks.

1132
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:45,860
I just don't think they play a lot of point and clicks.

1133
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:57,860
I've never heard of it until you played it.

1134
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:59,060
Man, maybe I'm...

1135
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:09,300
I think maybe it's because I knew the history of it.

1136
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:11,460
I thought I thought that I...

1137
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:14,900
I think maybe that I was...

1138
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:16,100
I thought that, perhaps.

1139
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:20,500
Me, I do Azarel also play point and clicks.

1140
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:21,540
Nice, nice actually.

1141
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:29,060
Maybe it's because I knew the history about it that I was like,

1142
02:17:29,060 --> 02:17:30,500
oh yeah, it's a common game.

1143
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:34,660
Is it very meiju?

1144
02:17:35,060 --> 02:17:43,140
Can you guys tell that my sense of what's popular and what's not

1145
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:45,220
is severely skewed?

1146
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:49,060
It's severely skewed?

1147
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:02,660
Point and click brain round.

1148
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:03,780
Honestly, honestly.

1149
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:07,140
Every time like, oh yeah, people are like,

1150
02:18:07,140 --> 02:18:09,380
oh, have you played this really niche game called...

1151
02:18:11,940 --> 02:18:15,140
I have no mouth and I must scream and I'm like, oh yeah.

1152
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:16,660
Isn't it popular though?

1153
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,500
Isn't it like, didn't it win awards and stuff?

1154
02:18:22,980 --> 02:18:25,700
Like Harvester, I feel like everyone kind of knew it.

1155
02:18:28,980 --> 02:18:31,140
Thank you for the $3.33,

1156
02:18:31,940 --> 02:18:33,620
how do I become your favorite senpai?

1157
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:35,540
I don't play favoritisms.

1158
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:47,460
I don't play favoritism except, you know, like the girlies, the like...

1159
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:53,700
Like, if Serenity says she's like a senpai then like,

1160
02:18:55,140 --> 02:19:00,660
technically she has rights and like the Yume plus girls, they have...

1161
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:04,660
They work to dig the...

1162
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:12,020
They also do some work to dig the holes outside to hide the bodies.

1163
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:21,060
So they get a little bit more but I let my...

1164
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:23,060
I let my...

1165
02:19:33,460 --> 02:19:35,460
I let my...

1166
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:40,340
Yeah, content creator rights.

1167
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:45,380
They have a little bit more things but like honestly,

1168
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:50,820
if you told me who would I choose Serenity or Senpai, I would choose Senpai.

1169
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:54,820
I'm sorry Serenity, I...

1170
02:19:54,820 --> 02:19:56,740
I'm sorry but you get it, right?

1171
02:19:56,740 --> 02:19:57,220
You get it.

1172
02:20:11,940 --> 02:20:13,860
But like Serenity is a pretty close second.

1173
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:21,380
That's surprising.

1174
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:28,820
You have no idea how much joy Senpai, you give me, honestly.

1175
02:20:33,460 --> 02:20:36,100
You have no idea how much joy you all give me.

1176
02:20:38,980 --> 02:20:40,660
And if you weren't my number one,

1177
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:46,660
why would I try to try so hard to keep you here, you know?

1178
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:58,340
On a scale of one to ten of joy, one million, one million, three billion!

1179
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:08,820
You just have to stay on course, okay?

1180
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:10,100
You just have to stay on course.

1181
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:22,180
You just have to stay on course.

1182
02:21:23,460 --> 02:21:28,740
If Senpai steps out of line from my fairy tale, I might get a little mad.

1183
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:34,500
But overall, I do love you very, very, very, very much.

1184
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:40,900
It's not a bit, it's not an act, I truly do.

1185
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:47,460
Because without you, I wouldn't be able to have so much fun.

1186
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:49,940
And every day is like a date.

1187
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:55,380
And I'm always, I always go to bed thinking about my Senpais.

1188
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:58,660
And I always go to bed and I wake up in the morning going,

1189
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:00,820
I want to hang out with Senpai.

1190
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:15,860
I won't stalk Senpai too much.

1191
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:23,540
As long as Senpai doesn't look into me too much either.

1192
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:28,660
Okay, I won't show up at Senpai's house unannounced, unless...

1193
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:33,140
You know what, actually, no, I get that right, never mind.

1194
02:22:33,140 --> 02:22:34,340
I get that right, you do not.

1195
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:44,420
Why? Because you're stuck in the cage!

1196
02:22:54,500 --> 02:23:05,380
But like, I don't want, I don't, I really, my boundaries is that I just don't want to like,

1197
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:11,220
I literally do not want Mama and Papa Mercy to get involved.

1198
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:14,420
Because I would be pissed.

1199
02:23:23,620 --> 02:23:34,420
And like, I, as I said, back, back a while ago, I do, I did have quite the violent tendency.

1200
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:37,140
And it might come out again.

1201
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:43,540
It might come out of the end.

1202
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:49,220
Which is why...

1203
02:23:49,860 --> 02:23:58,100
Which is why I got a lot of maros saying like, what did you mean by like, don't get overly attached?

1204
02:23:58,100 --> 02:24:00,580
I mean, I meant like, don't get my family involved, don't like,

1205
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:07,700
don't like, you know, bother my family or my friends about that.

1206
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:11,380
Because I, I will get pissed, I will get pissed.

1207
02:24:11,380 --> 02:24:16,020
And probably like, you will see more of the Yan and not any of the Dairy part.

1208
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:30,500
Like, I thought, I thought, I thought the way, I realized the way I worded it is weird.

1209
02:24:31,220 --> 02:24:35,780
But I meant, I meant it as like, don't get too attached as in like, you call my parents and

1210
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:42,020
my, my IRL friends have to lock their doors or something because I will...

1211
02:24:44,020 --> 02:24:45,620
I don't think there would be another Senpai.

1212
02:24:50,180 --> 02:24:54,420
I don't think there will be a Senpai because I'm very protective.

1213
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:58,100
I'm very protective of them.

1214
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:08,900
And I think I would get pissed, I would get pissed.

1215
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:13,380
I think I legitimately would get pissed because that is not a part of my fairy tale.

1216
02:25:13,940 --> 02:25:16,740
That is not a part of my fairy tale happy ending.

1217
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:23,460
You would mess with your family?

1218
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:24,020
I don't know.

1219
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:27,780
It's, I don't know.

1220
02:25:29,780 --> 02:25:33,540
But there was a lot of times where I had to get involved because

1221
02:25:34,180 --> 02:25:36,820
I, I am protective of my family.

1222
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:41,860
Like for example, someone, okay, this is a long time ago, so don't worry.

1223
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:47,140
Don't worry, someone assaulted my

1224
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:53,140
Papa Mercy, my father, and I was so fucking pissed.

1225
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:58,820
I was about to get over there with like a knife and just go at it.

1226
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:01,140
Just like go crazy.

1227
02:26:05,460 --> 02:26:08,660
So I'm very protective of them.

1228
02:26:08,660 --> 02:26:10,180
I'm beyond protective of them.

1229
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:20,660
So, yeah.

1230
02:26:23,380 --> 02:26:25,220
Like I was, I was, I was mad.

1231
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:27,380
I was mad.

1232
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:34,740
You mean like a stranger physically attacked him like in a parking lot?

1233
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:36,340
A neighbor, a neighbor did.

1234
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:42,180
And a neighbor did and the cops are called and I was about to like

1235
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:43,540
break down that neighbor's door.

1236
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:48,260
I moved, luckily, but I was about to break down that neighbor's door.

1237
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:50,740
The one who stole his presents?

1238
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:51,380
No, no, no.

1239
02:26:51,380 --> 02:26:52,340
That's a different neighbor.

1240
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:55,460
Different neighbor.

1241
02:26:55,460 --> 02:27:02,340
I, the police did get involved and luckily, so I calmed down quite a bit, but I was,

1242
02:27:07,140 --> 02:27:07,700
I was mad.

1243
02:27:08,820 --> 02:27:13,060
And honestly, sometimes some senpais get me really mad too.

1244
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:15,620
Like some senpais get me really pissed.

1245
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:22,980
I don't know if those are real senpais or like fake senpais, but some senpais make me really pissed.

1246
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:30,260
Because like sometimes I feel like my boundaries are

1247
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:38,180
like probably fake senpais, but sometimes, like sometimes my boundaries are like they say mean

1248
02:27:38,180 --> 02:27:40,020
things and I'm just like pissed.

1249
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:50,980
Make sure to say something if we make you pissed.

1250
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:55,300
You know, you know, you know, if I'm pissed.

1251
02:27:56,020 --> 02:28:03,780
You know, if I'm pissed, there will be a few signs to know that I'm pissed.

1252
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:09,700
It's not me, right?

1253
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:12,740
No, no, no, I'm, I've been, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1254
02:28:17,860 --> 02:28:21,380
Like I think you'll know when I get pissed because there's some obvious signs.

1255
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:27,460
The first sign of being annoyed is if I go, if I start talking like this,

1256
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:29,700
it means I'm really fucking annoyed.

1257
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:36,260
And that's when senpais need to settle down a little.

1258
02:28:39,460 --> 02:28:40,660
And then I get really pissed.

1259
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:41,540
I will call mods.

1260
02:28:42,820 --> 02:28:46,500
You know, you know, if I'm pissed, I will call the mods.

1261
02:28:51,540 --> 02:29:00,180
But no, no, no, sometimes I get pissed on messages when I see certain messages.

1262
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:06,820
Yeah, if you're, they're trying to push boundaries and stuff.

1263
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:09,220
Most likely fake senpais, yeah.

1264
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:14,500
I even hesitate to call them senpais because then I'm just like,

1265
02:29:15,300 --> 02:29:16,900
are they a pretender?

1266
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:18,180
Are they a faker?

1267
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:19,380
Are they not in the cage?

1268
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:23,940
I apologize in advance.

1269
02:29:23,940 --> 02:29:24,580
Don't worry.

1270
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:28,900
Water off a duck's back.

1271
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:31,940
I can forgive pretty easily, except for certain things.

1272
02:29:34,260 --> 02:29:35,380
Except for certain things.

1273
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:38,660
Then I don't forgive at all, ever.

1274
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:43,300
Boundaries how?

1275
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:56,340
Things that I don't like crossed, for example, would be like.

1276
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:06,900
Let's give, let's give a fairly light example that I don't like.

1277
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:11,140
My fairly light example that I don't like is a backhanded compliment.

1278
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:22,340
Another thing that's like, oh my God.

1279
02:30:23,220 --> 02:30:23,780
Pam!

1280
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:29,060
B-C-O-L of Play Asia.

1281
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:32,580
Congrats upon attization.

1282
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:34,180
Thank you, Pam.

1283
02:30:34,180 --> 02:30:34,740
Thank you.

1284
02:30:36,820 --> 02:30:38,100
Thank you, Raiders.

1285
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:41,460
Hello, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

1286
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:44,500
This is my monetization stream, and we just finished play.

1287
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:45,620
No, just wait.

1288
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:47,620
How long have I been yapping for?

1289
02:30:47,620 --> 02:30:49,460
How long have I been yapping for?

1290
02:30:50,260 --> 02:30:50,980
Oh, I don't know.

1291
02:30:50,980 --> 02:30:52,740
Anyways, I did play.

1292
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:57,220
I did play Don't Scream, and I was screaming internally so hard.

1293
02:30:57,220 --> 02:30:57,700
I was like.

1294
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:00,180
But like more like.

1295
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:05,460
Boundaries talking to her.

1296
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:06,020
Forget it.

1297
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:06,740
Forget about it.

1298
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:10,340
Was I talking for 40 minutes?

1299
02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:20,340
Why does chat need to know how to push your buttons?

1300
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:21,540
Are you sure that's a good idea?

1301
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:22,020
You're right.

1302
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,220
I'm going to shut the fuck up now.

1303
02:31:29,460 --> 02:31:29,940
You know what?

1304
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:31,220
Silence!

1305
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:33,540
Silence!

1306
02:31:36,740 --> 02:31:37,220
You're right.

1307
02:31:37,220 --> 02:31:38,180
I'm going to shut the fuck up.

1308
02:31:39,460 --> 02:31:42,020
See, I get loose-lipped when I'm around Senpai,

1309
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:44,100
because I feel so comfortable around Senpai.

1310
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:54,100
See, this is why we have secrets between us.

1311
02:31:54,100 --> 02:31:57,300
We have secrets between us because it can be leaked, okay?

1312
02:31:57,300 --> 02:32:00,260
Sometimes there are fake Senpais amongst us.

1313
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:01,460
They're rude.

1314
02:32:02,580 --> 02:32:03,460
I must be cold.

1315
02:32:08,180 --> 02:32:09,860
Oh, thank you.

1316
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:10,660
You suck at best.

1317
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:12,260
Even though you can't sit the zap too,

1318
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:14,180
we always ended up getting it anyways.

1319
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:18,500
No, I don't want secrets.

1320
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:19,700
It's secrets.

1321
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:20,980
Respect them.

1322
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:26,580
I don't know all about Kawaii.

1323
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:33,300
But Senpai made a good point saying that you could use it against me.

1324
02:32:33,300 --> 02:32:33,940
And you know what?

1325
02:32:34,900 --> 02:32:35,700
That's fair.

1326
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:37,940
So therefore, tight-lipped, I be.

1327
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:49,380
Mercy, you've been talking for over an hour.

1328
02:32:49,380 --> 02:32:51,300
I really should stop talking.

1329
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:53,300
Honestly, I really should stop talking.

1330
02:32:57,780 --> 02:32:58,820
Which lips?

1331
02:32:58,820 --> 02:33:00,180
The one on my face.

1332
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:06,980
Ah!

1333
02:33:18,180 --> 02:33:18,820
Let's be real.

1334
02:33:18,820 --> 02:33:20,500
If you were playing on Maury, it would be longer.

1335
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:21,940
Nah, I feel like I shouldn't.

1336
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:22,820
I shouldn't, yeah.

1337
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:24,740
Because I feel like a lot of people take

1338
02:33:25,620 --> 02:33:28,180
what I say, when I yap, out of context.

1339
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:30,820
And I'm just like...

1340
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:36,900
I'm not very articulate with words.

1341
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:39,140
I'm not good with words.

1342
02:33:41,060 --> 02:33:42,900
So I feel like I shouldn't yap as much.

1343
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:49,060
I shouldn't yap.

1344
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:52,820
I shouldn't yap so much because I always get marbles.

1345
02:33:53,860 --> 02:33:55,380
Marbles by the end going,

1346
02:33:55,380 --> 02:33:56,660
what did you mean by this?

1347
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:05,540
What did you mean by this knife?

1348
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:06,020
I'm like...

1349
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:13,300
I shouldn't yap.

1350
02:34:13,300 --> 02:34:14,660
I should stop yapping.

1351
02:34:14,660 --> 02:34:36,020
I will yap if you promise not to take everything I say into a cruel position.

1352
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:45,540
Because I get marbles and I'm like...

1353
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:49,780
I shouldn't even be telling you this.

1354
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:51,140
This is how loose-lipped I am.

1355
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:52,820
See, this is why I shouldn't yap.

1356
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:55,620
Because then I tell you things that I wasn't planning to tell you.

1357
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:56,260
Man, I...

1358
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:02,260
Man!

1359
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:10,420
Is it this rash talking or is it me?

1360
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:12,900
It's probably the, yeah, the rash talking.

1361
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:14,820
And I am...

1362
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:17,780
Man.

1363
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:28,980
It's the evil rash.

1364
02:35:28,980 --> 02:35:30,580
It's making me say things.

1365
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:35,300
Make sticky notes to remind you of things not to say.

1366
02:35:36,020 --> 02:35:36,820
Man!

1367
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:46,340
My yandere can't help but overshare.

1368
02:35:46,340 --> 02:35:48,660
I love how trusting she is before she ends me.

1369
02:35:48,660 --> 02:35:49,940
Oh my gosh.

1370
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:50,820
I know.

1371
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:53,860
I feel so comfortable around Senpai.

1372
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:54,500
And then I'm like...

1373
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:03,460
No, now Senpai's in order for you to keep the secret forever.

1374
02:36:03,460 --> 02:36:04,100
It's over.

1375
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:08,020
It's over.

1376
02:36:09,460 --> 02:36:11,620
I overshare a lot.

1377
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:12,980
That's a bad habit of mine.

1378
02:36:25,380 --> 02:36:27,140
Are you going to take our away our tongues?

1379
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:28,180
Yoink!

1380
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:31,540
No, no flavors.

1381
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:32,020
No tests.

1382
02:36:32,740 --> 02:36:33,540
No taste tests.

1383
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:35,140
It's just gone.

1384
02:36:36,980 --> 02:36:38,500
You should avoid doxing yourself.

1385
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:41,060
I'm very careful about that.

1386
02:36:55,300 --> 02:36:57,060
I have no tongue and I must scream.

1387
02:36:58,020 --> 02:36:59,860
That would be a fun parody game.

1388
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:03,300
But then again, it's kind of like a silly game itself.

1389
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:05,780
I have no mouth and I must scream.

1390
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:08,100
But then again, it's kind of like a silly game itself.

1391
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:15,300
Overshare.

1392
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:17,700
No, I'm so bad.

1393
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:19,300
Everyone.

1394
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:19,940
Everyone.

1395
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:21,540
Senpais, please look.

1396
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:22,180
Please look.

1397
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:24,020
Right here.

1398
02:37:24,660 --> 02:37:26,180
I learned this from Strawny.

1399
02:37:26,180 --> 02:37:26,500
Ready?

1400
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:27,860
Right here.

1401
02:37:30,580 --> 02:37:30,900
OK.

1402
02:37:33,060 --> 02:37:33,940
Begetty beam.

1403
02:37:36,020 --> 02:38:05,580
So how's the games and pie?

1404
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:10,460
I did a good job at hiding my screams right?

1405
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:21,500
Congratulations monetization! Yes, yes, yes!

1406
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:30,620
The game was great, yeah!

1407
02:38:36,300 --> 02:38:43,420
How many members are you up to? I don't actually know how to check that senpai!

1408
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:47,420
I don't know how to check that senpai!

1409
02:38:56,940 --> 02:38:59,340
Thought it would take longer for you to to beat.

1410
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:06,620
Screaming internally! I have learned a new trick today was that I can scream internally.

1411
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:12,220
I just noticed you have emotes mercy! Yeah, do you like them?

1412
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:14,060
Strawny picked them out.

1413
02:39:18,860 --> 02:39:23,660
At least one, I think I have at least one meh, one member.

1414
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:35,580
Oh, speaking of, I finally relaxed! I finally relaxed a little bit yesterday.

1415
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:41,260
Yesterday, so I could have my first day off, although I did work put a little bit on my day off.

1416
02:39:42,140 --> 02:39:48,060
It's my day off from streaming, not day off from working and at violor.

1417
02:39:54,140 --> 02:40:01,500
I found, I found, I found some fun, but I found one white hair!

1418
02:40:03,980 --> 02:40:12,060
I found one white hair! Oh my gosh! I was like, oh, I went, I guess, I guess I was really stressed, huh?

1419
02:40:12,060 --> 02:40:14,060
Hahaha!

1420
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:25,020
Your schedule still make a pack! That was my mistake!

1421
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:32,940
The week after is only three streams! I double checked! I triple, triple, triple checked!

1422
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:43,500
I triple checked, I quad triple checked, made sure I have only three streams next week!

1423
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:58,220
The one, the one white hair! Probably since debut prep! I was like,

1424
02:40:58,220 --> 02:41:04,620
ahhh! You know who found it? You know how, who found it? I was sitting down and then

1425
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:08,780
Mama Mercy looked over and she's like, sweetie, you have a white hair! And I was like, ahhh!

1426
02:41:16,780 --> 02:41:23,660
Actually, it's, apparently that happens to me quite a bit. I mean, like, when I was in high school,

1427
02:41:23,660 --> 02:41:32,780
I had a white hair, but that doesn't make sense! Like, one white hair was like, completely white!

1428
02:41:37,020 --> 02:41:45,820
I was like, oh, if I'm under great duress, it's, it turns, one, one strand turns completely white!

1429
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:50,140
With a little bit of like,

1430
02:41:54,220 --> 02:42:01,180
real talk, those can just happen regularly because of circumstances due to cellular,

1431
02:42:01,180 --> 02:42:05,820
cellular irregularities. I have one pale white beard hair every other time I shave.

1432
02:42:08,780 --> 02:42:16,220
What? You can't call me a hag just from one, you can't call me a hag just from one, one white hair!

1433
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:22,300
You can't just call me a hag from that.

1434
02:42:27,660 --> 02:42:31,980
I just, I'm just saying that I had one because I feel like I probably overworked myself, yeah.

1435
02:42:35,260 --> 02:42:41,740
We love hags! Honestly, when someone called me a hag for the first time, I was like, what?!

1436
02:42:42,700 --> 02:42:50,140
I was so upset, and I went to look it up, and then I, and all of it was still in salt,

1437
02:42:50,140 --> 02:42:54,860
so I was too upset, and then someone had to tell me, no, no, no, hag means, it's, it's a good thing,

1438
02:42:54,860 --> 02:43:06,700
and I was like, I don't believe you, and then, and then, and then, and then I found out, yeah,

1439
02:43:07,660 --> 02:43:08,540
it's a good thing.

1440
02:43:13,740 --> 02:43:17,820
I found out it was a good thing. I, I was upset at first though, I was like,

1441
02:43:20,300 --> 02:43:21,340
how dare you?

1442
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:33,740
Slaying is hard! I'm, I'm having trouble keeping up some like, some, some sayings and stuff.

1443
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:46,940
Slaying is hard. I just can't keep up anymore. Take me back to the days when like, the big,

1444
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:55,500
trendy word of the day was epic. That was so epic. Wow. Epic story, man.

1445
02:43:56,060 --> 02:44:08,940
Yolo. Leet.

1446
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:16,540
Like a boss. Oh my gosh, yeah.

1447
02:44:26,460 --> 02:44:27,500
Hell.

1448
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:36,700
Booper was hot for a hot minute, was it? Oh my gosh.

1449
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:41,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, O'Reilly? O'Reilly?

1450
02:44:46,380 --> 02:44:46,940
O'Reilly?

1451
02:44:56,460 --> 02:45:06,620
What else did they have? Oh, and memes back there were like, back then was like, oh shoot,

1452
02:45:06,620 --> 02:45:17,900
what was the first one I saw? The philosopher? I think the philosopher was, was, was the memes

1453
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:25,180
where they had it on like the kind of like, alternating, not the alternating like, I don't know,

1454
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:30,380
background with the impact font on top and impact font at the bottom.

1455
02:45:37,100 --> 02:45:41,100
Oh, oh, oh, I made you a cookie, but I ate it.

1456
02:45:44,940 --> 02:45:49,580
Or, or the, uh,

1457
02:45:49,740 --> 02:45:56,780
what is it? The actor, what's his face from?

1458
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:11,260
The Willy Wonka man leaning on, on the, on, on a hand going saying something that's like,

1459
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:13,660
I don't remember that one.

1460
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:22,380
Uh, Gene Wilder? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where his leaning is like, oh, tell me about this, blah, blah, blah.

1461
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:29,500
These are ancient. I'm trying to think of like,

1462
02:46:30,220 --> 02:46:34,220
sums that I can barely remember them.

1463
02:46:34,380 --> 02:46:41,340
Ra, Ra means I love you in dinosaur.

1464
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:48,620
Yeah, the ones that saw condescending. Yeah, I can barely remember them.

1465
02:46:48,620 --> 02:46:52,300
What's that angry wolf one? I remember seeing that sometimes.

1466
02:46:53,020 --> 02:47:01,820
Good guy, Greg. Yeah.

1467
02:47:03,900 --> 02:47:08,460
Can I has cheese bugger insanity wolf? Really?

1468
02:47:10,780 --> 02:47:12,940
What's it called insanity wolf? It's the wolf one.

1469
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:21,500
Chuck Norris. All right. I remember Chuck Norris. Everyone kept on doing Chuck Norris stuff.

1470
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:32,380
You should do an old meme tier list. Can I even remember old memes?

1471
02:47:33,740 --> 02:47:43,500
Memes go by so fast nowadays. I can't keep up with them.

1472
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:49,500
Chuck Norris can count your infinity twice.

1473
02:47:52,700 --> 02:47:55,820
I don't remember a lot of these. These are like,

1474
02:47:59,340 --> 02:48:01,180
these are like the ones where I'm like, huh.

1475
02:48:06,700 --> 02:48:07,660
I wonder.

1476
02:48:13,660 --> 02:48:21,020
Isn't Doge kind of new though? Is this kind of new? Maybe I'm out of, I'm out, I'm not much.

1477
02:48:21,900 --> 02:48:23,340
I'm out of time.

1478
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:29,980
Doge is like a decade old.

1479
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:39,660
Man, time is a construct.

1480
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:52,460
I'm probably too much of a zoomer to know about hamster dance and dancing, baby.

1481
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:05,340
Things I can barely remember.

1482
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:10,780
I also remember.

1483
02:49:16,220 --> 02:49:25,740
She's gen X is over. Stop. Stop. Stop. Okay. Listen. Listen, guys. Listen, guys.

1484
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:29,500
Listen, senpai.

1485
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:43,900
I feel like, I feel like some of you have put me into age brackets and I'm just like,

1486
02:49:48,460 --> 02:49:52,140
I don't know if you will. I don't know. I don't know.

1487
02:49:59,580 --> 02:50:04,940
Into age brackets and I don't think they're entirely correct.

1488
02:50:11,820 --> 02:50:17,100
Don't let me in. Okay. Some senpais, some senpais have put me into age brackets

1489
02:50:17,980 --> 02:50:20,620
and I don't think they're entirely correct.

1490
02:50:21,580 --> 02:50:32,540
I feel like I've given many hints to the age range and I feel like all of it is being missed.

1491
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:45,180
You remember meeting Julius Caesar? What do you mean? I'm him.

1492
02:50:45,820 --> 02:50:48,940
I'm him.

1493
02:51:04,060 --> 02:51:06,620
I'm skibbity straight

1494
02:51:06,620 --> 02:51:11,980
bussin. What else did I say?

1495
02:51:13,820 --> 02:51:15,420
God damn.

1496
02:51:18,620 --> 02:51:19,180
Zam.

1497
02:51:30,140 --> 02:51:30,380
She.

1498
02:51:30,380 --> 02:51:40,140
She. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Rizzler.

1499
02:52:00,460 --> 02:52:12,140
I can't catch up nowadays. I can't catch up nowadays.

1500
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:26,140
Give me days. Give me damn. I don't know.

1501
02:52:26,460 --> 02:52:31,500
How's your back doing? It's fine. My back is fine.

1502
02:52:36,380 --> 02:52:44,700
I don't remember. I remember finally being taught like a lot of slang and I just kept on using them

1503
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:47,900
and then my friends were like, I have no idea what you're talking about.

1504
02:52:57,020 --> 02:53:09,580
And then and then the new things are different.

1505
02:53:09,580 --> 02:53:21,020
For real. For real. F.R.F.R. straight bussin. No cap on God.

1506
02:53:26,220 --> 02:53:27,020
Is there anything else?

1507
02:53:39,900 --> 02:53:46,380
I can't think of any anyone.

1508
02:53:49,020 --> 02:54:01,900
Yeet. Goon. Yeah. Oh, shit. Right. I'm goon. Maxing. I don't know what people say. I keep on.

1509
02:54:01,900 --> 02:54:18,220
I keep on hearing that. I'm in Max and my gooning.

1510
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:47,900
I forgot. Maxing was like a thing. Sometimes I can't even. I don't understand when sometimes

1511
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:49,420
when someone says things.

1512
02:54:54,620 --> 02:54:56,780
When someone says things, I'm like, what do you mean?

1513
02:54:57,260 --> 02:55:06,300
I'm rep maxing blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, wagey, cagey, something, something.

1514
02:55:07,740 --> 02:55:13,500
And I'm like, okay, I got it. I got it.

1515
02:55:16,220 --> 02:55:19,260
I got it. No, I don't freaking get it.

1516
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:31,580
It's all goon maxed together.

1517
02:55:31,740 --> 02:55:43,900
I think.

1518
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:57,420
I think. Wrong side for that. I meant, I meant, I, a boss, a boss. Where, where the, where the at?

1519
02:55:57,420 --> 02:56:10,220
Let us add him. A boss. A boss. What I do with this? What I do with these ropes?

1520
02:56:20,940 --> 02:56:25,260
A boss.

1521
02:56:27,580 --> 02:56:32,700
That's, that's what we mean, YouTube. That's what we mean. We mean, we're, we're, we're maxing,

1522
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:37,500
we're maxing the goons, like the henchmen.

1523
02:56:44,460 --> 02:56:51,260
A boss. What do we say? We take these fellas over to the docks and get them sleepy with them fishes.

1524
02:56:51,260 --> 02:56:58,140
Use cousin troubles for the coal.

1525
02:57:01,260 --> 02:57:15,100
Yeah, correct. We are upping our henchmen game, not anything else.

1526
02:57:21,660 --> 02:57:33,100
Not anything else.

1527
02:57:37,260 --> 02:57:47,100
We hired goons.

1528
02:57:51,980 --> 02:58:02,700
We gotta, we gotta get them boys. They gotta get them boys. Come on.

1529
02:58:08,380 --> 02:58:14,220
Aren't you all just strawnees hired goons, like henchmen? No, we're strawnees daughters.

1530
02:58:15,100 --> 02:58:17,100
We're strawnees daughters.

1531
02:58:18,060 --> 02:58:21,900
We're strawnees daughters.

1532
02:58:24,140 --> 02:58:28,460
Her trained, her trained little succubi.

1533
02:58:33,820 --> 02:58:37,580
Fiendishly taking away your sleep and

1534
02:58:38,220 --> 02:58:54,780
taking away your sleep and, and making sure, making sure you're, you're uh,

1535
02:58:55,500 --> 02:59:06,620
you're uh, you're, you're groomed. You're groomed by us.

1536
02:59:06,940 --> 02:59:18,460
Yes, yes, that was very safe work.

1537
02:59:18,780 --> 02:59:37,900
As in grooming our hair and stuff? Yeah, like that. We're grooming each other.

1538
02:59:39,340 --> 02:59:43,660
Yeah. No, actually it's only one way. I'm grooming you. Yes.

1539
02:59:43,660 --> 02:59:51,660
The veal or barbershop, barbershop quartet.

1540
02:59:55,420 --> 03:00:01,500
Wait, what's six? Wait, what's six instead of quartet? What's the, what's, what's six?

1541
03:00:14,620 --> 03:00:17,660
No, I can't say it like that. No!

1542
03:00:24,220 --> 03:00:33,660
You know what? Someone, someone should draw that. All of us as a barbershop.

1543
03:00:33,980 --> 03:00:44,380
It's all a part of the plan.

1544
03:00:51,100 --> 03:00:53,020
I think it is actually gonna fail.

1545
03:00:55,580 --> 03:00:59,820
That's really funny though. Everyone, we should, we should be drawn like that.

1546
03:01:04,540 --> 03:01:06,620
That's so funny.

1547
03:01:13,980 --> 03:01:19,340
Ah man, I talked too much. What do you want to be with? Well, there's six of us.

1548
03:01:23,020 --> 03:01:29,980
There's six of us. Put a mustache on all of them. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1549
03:01:33,980 --> 03:01:41,820
I take a look at my ginormous

1550
03:01:44,140 --> 03:01:47,260
and the travels just keep on mountain away.

1551
03:01:53,820 --> 03:01:55,980
I take a look at my ginormous

1552
03:02:04,620 --> 03:02:10,060
You're 30 wrong.

1553
03:02:15,900 --> 03:02:24,060
I know that song. No, I'm not. Stop guessing my age. I know this because of that song.

1554
03:02:24,060 --> 03:02:28,940
How old is that song anyways? I'm surprised it hasn't, hasn't been like picked up again.

1555
03:02:33,900 --> 03:02:36,860
I'm not 30 and I know that song. See?

1556
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:43,820
I'm eternal. I'm eternal. I'm forever your Kohai.

1557
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:52,220
Oh my gosh.

1558
03:02:55,420 --> 03:02:57,740
They broke up like 15 years ago. Oh, shit.

1559
03:03:04,220 --> 03:03:08,620
I'm in college age.

1560
03:03:13,820 --> 03:03:17,260
I thought Amy was an eternal one. Yeah, she is. I just want to feel like it.

1561
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:20,620
I think of everyone, I think.

1562
03:03:23,660 --> 03:03:27,980
I'm the only one who's sort of normal. When I say sort of normal, I feel like

1563
03:03:28,140 --> 03:03:33,580
there's other than, you know, you know, the obvious.

1564
03:03:45,740 --> 03:03:53,340
The fight normal. Well, I'm not like another creature.

1565
03:03:53,660 --> 03:04:04,140
I'm not like, you know, I'm not like an animal and I'm not, I don't have like mystical powers or I'm not.

1566
03:04:06,940 --> 03:04:11,500
You know, I'm not like a goddess or, you know, I don't,

1567
03:04:13,420 --> 03:04:16,300
yeah, I'm kind of normal compared to everyone else, right?

1568
03:04:16,540 --> 03:04:26,460
I'm like human. I'm, yeah, you mean human, right? You're right. How, how very bigoted of me to say that.

1569
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:31,100
I am just a human.

1570
03:04:31,100 --> 03:04:49,900
It's like, yeah, I guess I'm like the only one without superpowers, I guess.

1571
03:04:49,900 --> 03:05:02,540
As, as, as much as you can say.

1572
03:05:07,660 --> 03:05:10,700
I mean, like, Amy's like, ageless now.

1573
03:05:13,980 --> 03:05:19,020
Inhuman strength and agility when Senpai is naughty. Yeah, that's trainable, I guess.

1574
03:05:19,980 --> 03:05:25,100
Adrenaline and, adrenaline is a really powerful thing, don't you think, Senpai?

1575
03:05:32,620 --> 03:05:38,860
Not even the dragon trapped in your right eye. It's not a dragon trapped in my right eye.

1576
03:05:39,500 --> 03:05:43,740
It's the black flame trapped in my right eye.

1577
03:05:50,860 --> 03:05:59,900
We need to see to confirm. You know, I just, for that, you don't get to see it.

1578
03:06:02,860 --> 03:06:04,620
The dragon of the darkness flame.

1579
03:06:05,340 --> 03:06:24,300
My anger is what makes it appear. My eyes glow red when, when it happens.

1580
03:06:25,020 --> 03:06:34,540
I'm, these band-aids contain, contain the power. And if it's, and if it's released,

1581
03:06:35,180 --> 03:06:39,500
all will, will perish, perish by a million suns.

1582
03:06:44,780 --> 03:06:48,860
Your eyes are red though. They're not glowing red, are they?

1583
03:06:54,940 --> 03:07:06,780
It's like, it's like I have to capture you, Senpai. I have to capture you.

1584
03:07:07,340 --> 03:07:13,980
The dragon, the dragon is, is telling me I have to be with you. It's our destiny, our fate to be together.

1585
03:07:13,980 --> 03:07:27,660
You don't understand. We've been together since forever. We're tied by the red string of fate.

1586
03:07:44,620 --> 03:08:00,300
We're, we're destined to be together. I mean, like, in, in, in a previous life, you were my prince and I was a prince.

1587
03:08:07,100 --> 03:08:11,660
And the life before that, I was Julius Caesar.

1588
03:08:13,980 --> 03:08:17,660
And the life before that, I was Julius Caesar.

1589
03:08:43,980 --> 03:08:57,660
Can I get some avays and chat?

1590
03:09:13,980 --> 03:09:35,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1591
03:09:44,300 --> 03:09:54,860
Sorry, I have bubble tea. I bought it earlier.

1592
03:10:03,820 --> 03:10:08,540
Thank you, Senpais. Oh my gosh, I've yapped for so long right now. What flavor?

1593
03:10:09,100 --> 03:10:12,460
Green tea strawberry.

1594
03:10:17,340 --> 03:10:25,420
Green tea strawberry is the bubble tea flavor. Um, fun fact, tapioca sometimes, uh, I order,

1595
03:10:25,420 --> 03:10:33,980
I always order it without the tapioca because, uh, tapioca sometimes is coated in egg white,

1596
03:10:33,980 --> 03:10:38,060
so I can't have it. So I have to order it with either just jelly or nothing.

1597
03:10:44,220 --> 03:10:45,500
Traina thought interrupted.

1598
03:10:50,860 --> 03:10:54,940
The egg strikes again. I can't have tapioca because they sometimes,

1599
03:10:55,500 --> 03:11:02,540
yeah, they sometimes coat it in egg white to make it like slimy-er, kind of.

1600
03:11:04,460 --> 03:11:15,500
So I can only either get the jelly or, or nothing.

1601
03:11:18,060 --> 03:11:22,940
Eggs, eggs are surprisingly in everything or in a lot of things. You never, you'd never really

1602
03:11:22,940 --> 03:11:28,300
expect some eggs will be in something and then, uh, my lifetime will tell you, yeah,

1603
03:11:28,300 --> 03:11:33,820
sometimes they do. I have to double check.

1604
03:11:38,620 --> 03:11:43,100
I just realized you can't have a lot of fried chicken. Yeah, I can't have fried

1605
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:45,020
chickens, certain fried chickens. Yeah.

1606
03:11:49,580 --> 03:11:55,340
You think you're destined to have an et tu brutus? Et tu brutus? Moment with et tu

1607
03:11:55,420 --> 03:12:02,220
psempai? I don't want to be betrayed by psempai. You take that back. You take those words back.

1608
03:12:04,060 --> 03:12:08,940
You take those words back right now. Psempai, you're never going to betray me, right?

1609
03:12:08,940 --> 03:12:15,580
It depends on how you get stabbed.

1610
03:12:30,940 --> 03:12:35,660
Probably why go high as past issues we were brutus in the past life. I can't

1611
03:12:38,940 --> 03:12:49,420
never. We are your mark, Anthony. No. Don't betray me. Oh, anyways, psempai,

1612
03:12:51,660 --> 03:12:57,660
psempai, I have to go now. No, seriously, I have to go now. My rash is flaring up

1613
03:12:57,660 --> 03:13:03,100
right now and I'm going to have to ice it. So I'm going to leave you here right now.

1614
03:13:03,100 --> 03:13:07,180
I'm going to see if anyone's online to send you there. Thank you so much for showing you,

1615
03:13:07,660 --> 03:13:14,380
showing me such kindness on my first monetization stream. I'm so, so, so happy and I'm so thankful

1616
03:13:14,380 --> 03:13:18,940
for the generosity. So I have to go. This is acting up right now.

1617
03:13:21,900 --> 03:13:27,260
So let's see who's online. If not, I'll just, I got to go. I got to go.

1618
03:13:27,660 --> 03:13:32,060
Okay, Imi's online. So I'll send you guys to Imi.

1619
03:13:35,500 --> 03:13:36,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1620
03:13:42,300 --> 03:13:45,580
Yeah, I got to go. I got to go. Let me get Imi's stream first.

1621
03:13:45,980 --> 03:13:59,660
Okay. Thank you, everyone. And tomorrow is a diff- I am doing a collab. It will be

1622
03:14:00,380 --> 03:14:07,180
at an earlier time. Please check the time. What time is it? What time is it that is it at? It's at

1623
03:14:07,900 --> 03:14:13,660
2 p.m. EDT. So please remember that if you want to check it out. It's probably,

1624
03:14:14,700 --> 03:14:19,100
so I'll see you again next time, Senpai.

1625
03:14:24,140 --> 03:14:29,740
Screen for Mercy. And thank you once again for your kindness.
