00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marci, and it's me, Marcio,

2
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

7
00:09:37,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

8
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

9
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio, and it's me, Marcio,

12
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and it's me, Marcio, Marcio, from, from, from, super Marcio RPG, and totally not the

13
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,720
The Allure Gen 1 Indulge.

14
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,560
Ha ha ha ha!

15
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Ha ha ha ha!

16
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,140
Yeah!

17
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,460
Look at that, got my attack up too.

18
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,300
Yes, hit yourself.

19
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,280
Why are you hitting yourself?

20
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,360
Why are you hitting yourself?

21
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,520
Ha ha ha ha!

22
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

23
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,820
Ha ha ha ha!

24
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But welcome everyone, thank you for bringing everyone here, I really appreciate it!

25
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,880
Keep yourself safe.

26
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,160
In game, of course.

27
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Am I allowed to go this way?

28
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I don't know.

29
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
I'm going back.

30
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Hold on.

31
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Hold on.

32
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,160
I need to go shopping.

33
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
I need to go shopping.

34
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Who are you?

35
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,160
This bus is undergoing repairs.

36
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Sorry, I need to go shopping, I forgot.

37
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I need to get new items.

38
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I need to get new items.

39
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
No weapons, weapons!

40
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Yeah, yeah, I need new weapons.

41
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Yeah.

42
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Woohoo!

43
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
How wild did they just let us in and out now?

44
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Yeah!

45
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Give me a second.

46
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Do you have stuff here?

47
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I hope to serve the king again soon.

48
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
Smellas, I remembered him.

49
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
He used to be so small, so timid.

50
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Now look at him!

51
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
You know about the royal bus?

52
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
No!

53
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,160
It's a real vehicle, only used by the king.

54
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
It's parked now due to the fact he's ill.

55
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
King Nimbus loves statues and birds.

56
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,160
He has scads of them in the castle.

57
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Let me jump on things.

58
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Ah!

59
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
No!

60
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Jump!

61
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Jump!

62
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Wait, can I jump on the pillows?

63
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Whee!

64
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Boing!

65
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
Boing!

66
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Boing!

67
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,160
At the cartridge of this game?

68
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,160
I don't know if I have the cartridge of this game.

69
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
But...

70
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
This is my first time playing it, so I'm playing the remake.

71
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
He used to be able to walk through the castle freely,

72
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
but I guess we shouldn't disturb the king now.

73
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
You know, volcano?

74
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Not yet.

75
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Panos to the east.

76
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
I wish I could take a dip in the springs.

77
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
There's a spring there!

78
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Do they have...

79
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Oh, there it is!

80
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Wait, there's like a whole section back here.

81
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Is there like a secret person here?

82
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Secret thing?

83
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
No?

84
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Dang it.

85
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Welcome!

86
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
So you want to take a rest?

87
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
I'm sure that's why you're here.

88
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Be 30 coins a night.

89
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Oh, thanks.

90
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Please come back again.

91
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Let me use this.

92
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Whee!

93
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Do they have a...

94
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Oh, wait!

95
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
It's down here.

96
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
Oh, stairs!

97
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Oh, these are beds!

98
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
I thought they were tables!

99
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm kind of stupid!

100
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
I want, I want...

101
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
I want to go to hot springs.

102
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
It seems so relaxing and stuff.

103
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Ten pie!

104
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Ten pie!

105
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Oh!

106
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Sorry.

107
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I missed, I missed, I missed a tip.

108
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Wait a minute.

109
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Thank you for the $1 tip.

110
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Anonymous.

111
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Hi, Mercy.

112
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I'm in here, but I love your design already.

113
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
This Mercy, I mean...

114
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
You remind me of my favorite yander

115
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,160
and Chunni Gyo character in my favorite anime.

116
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Why are the crazy girls always the most loyal?

117
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Because we love you!

118
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,160
I mean, Mercy certainly loves you!

119
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
A lot!

120
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Super a lot!

121
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Aha!

122
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
And...

123
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
And...

124
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Thank you for the $1.45.

125
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Super Benny Garnes.

126
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Hello, Mercy.

127
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
My beloved, how are you doing today?

128
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
If Mercy was here...

129
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,160
If Mercy was here and totally not Mercy,

130
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Mercy would totally say,

131
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
say,

132
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm doing great.

133
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Hypothetically speaking,

134
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
if Mercy was here...

135
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
...

136
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Wait!

137
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
That tomato?

138
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Ha ha ha ha!

139
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Ha ha ha ha!

140
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Jalfel is sleeping.

141
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Jalfel's awake now!

142
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Oh, damn.

143
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Okay.

144
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
You die first, then.

145
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Resistant!

146
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Oh, yeah!

147
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Ow!

148
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Oh, he does a double punch!

149
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
You know what?

150
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
I'm gonna switch you out.

151
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Sorry.

152
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
I need Gino here right now.

153
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Oh!

154
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
There we go!

155
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Whee!

156
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Can I do a big Gino flash?

157
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Ha ha ha!

158
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
What the...

159
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
What is that?!

160
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Oh!

161
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Ha ha ha ha!

162
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Ha ha ha ha!

163
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Pinwheel!

164
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
That was such a slow thing.

165
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Boop boop boop boop!

166
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
No coins!

167
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
God, they're so poor.

168
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Shit!

169
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh, man.

170
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I need to get the timing better.

171
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
I am so bad at this right now.

172
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Bop!

173
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Ah!

174
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Stop missing!

175
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Stop missing!

176
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Thanks!

177
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Ah ha ha!

178
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Well, I don't know why.

179
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Okay, Gino meme!

180
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
He ran away!

181
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
What a coward!

182
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
What a coward!

183
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Timing hard!

184
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
I didn't pay attention to that.

185
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
I need to get the timing right.

186
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160

Question for you, Mercio, other than you as Mario, who is the other Vialour members as Mario characters?

222
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,900
Oh shit, we had this discussion before.

223
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,400
Uhhh...

224
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,300
How'd they know? It was me!

225
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Uhhh...

226
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,800
Uhhh...

227
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,600
Shibi is Luigi?

228
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,800
Lu Shibi?

229
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,100
Hahahaha!

230
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,200
And...

231
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,800
We thought...

232
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,700
Peach would be Icy...

233
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,300
Because...

234
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,900
Icy is a preen- is a PRINCESS!

235
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,500
Strony would be Yoshi...

236
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,900
Stro-shi?

237
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,300
Amy is told!

238
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,900
Yeah, Amy is told!

239
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,300
And...

240
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,700
Uhhh...

241
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,200
Azura...

242
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,800
Maybe we decided Azura was...

243
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,700
Bowser?

244
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,000
Hahahaha!

245
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,900
Because of the horns?

246
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,000
Bowser, right!

247
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,300
Hahahaha! We did do...

248
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,300
Azura as Bowser, because I thought of the horns.

249
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,200
Hahahaha!

250
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,200
Mu mu mu mu!

251
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,300
And that's how...

252
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,200
And that's how you get everyone!

253
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,000
But I definitely see Amy as, like, told.

254
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Ah!

255
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,600
How'd they know that I was...

256
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
I was here and not a statue?

257
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,100
Ah!

258
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,200
What happened to my timing?

259
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,400
Oh, you're still asleep?

260
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, we're good.

261
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,300
Hahahaha!

262
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,300
Wait, Amy being told is Timmy?

263
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Hahahaha!

264
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
What about Serenity?

265
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,300
Ah, jeez.

266
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,300
I don't even know where to put Serenity, either.

267
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
Hahahaha!

268
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,100
Was...

269
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Was Serenity?

270
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,900
If Amy I thought she would be Louie G since she's the younger sibling?

271
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,100
I prefer...

272
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,300
Well...

273
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,400
It's because...

274
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,100
I don't know.

275
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,700
Lush...

276
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,600
Lushibi...

277
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,500
Lou...

278
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,900
Sounded really good.

279
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Hahahaha!

280
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,700
Ah!

281
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,900
Forgot her.

282
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Triple move!

283
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
I just want to use the triple move now.

284
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Guy, please, please.

285
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
I don't like that you all survived.

286
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,900
That bothers me.

287
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Oh!

288
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
That's a big...

289
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
Hahahaha!

290
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,500
There we go.

291
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Goodbye, Tomei Toll.

292
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Okay.

293
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Where's Yoshi? Got it.

294
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,400
There we go!

295
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,100
They actually do spin, though.

296
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,200
They actually do spin, so...

297
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,400
You can like...

298
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,200
Um...

299
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,900
You can follow the Yoshi and see where it lands.

300
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Should I...

301
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,400
Should I start investing Mario in magic?

302
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,900
M-magic?

303
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,400
Ultra fireball!

304
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Ooh!

305
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
Okay, you get more magic now.

306
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,900
Star rain!

307
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,200
You've always gotten magic.

308
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,900
There's nothing.

309
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Otherwise, you're pretty useless.

310
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,900
The fuck did I hit?

311
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,900
Wait, where did they come from?

312
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
Where did they come from?

313
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Now it shows the thing.

314
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Yes, hit each other!

315
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
Hit each other!

316
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,900
Yes, good!

317
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
I can't believe it was real.

318
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
No, we haven't had any.

319
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Oh, he's so chunky.

320
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,900
Wait, are they statues like our enemies?

321
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
He's so cute.

322
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,900
Oh, they're so cute!

323
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,900
Oh, they're so cute!

324
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
I just want to hit him!

325
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
Man, actually, this is really hard.

326
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,900
Oh, I want to try this.

327
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
They're so cute!

328
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,900
They're so chonk!

329
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,900
I love them!

330
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Yay!

331
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,900
Dino!

332
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
I think...

333
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Dino's magic, right?

334
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
Those are for magics really good.

335
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Hey, wait a minute, it's locked!

336
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Why didn't you guard it if it's locked?

337
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Yay, mushroom!

338
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
Knew it!

339
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Okay, we're gonna get this.

340
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
We're gonna get this Senpai.

341
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,900
I actually have no faith in this.

342
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Fuck you!

343
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,900
I really don't have...

344
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,900
Well, it's a good thing that gets stunned.

345
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

346
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Fight each other!

347
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Kill, kill, kill!

348
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
You know this way.

349
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Big castle.

350
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,900
Stop hitting Mao!

351
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Hold on, where's...

352
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Need the mushroom.

353
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
Eat!

354
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
Eat, eat, eat!

355
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,900
Oh, thank goodness it's hitting itself.

356
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
Yeah!

357
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,900
Assh!

358
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
Yay!

359
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Ooh, frowny coin!

360
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,900
We're here.

361
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
Senpai!

362
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,900
I need, I need to take...

363
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,900
I need to take...

364
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
A Nido meeting!

365
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:39,900
I need to get an idle meeting.

366
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,180
BRB!

367
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:10,900
I need to get an idle meeting.

368
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:20,900
I need to get an idle meeting.

369
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:30,900
I need to get an idle meeting.

370
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:40,900
I need to get an idle meeting.

371
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:50,900
I need to get an idle meeting.

372
00:39:50,900 --> 00:40:00,900
I need to get an idle meeting.

What the? That is an establishment. That's Mario.

555
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:10,900
How utterly rude. And who in blazes are you anyway?

556
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,900
Me? I'm the real prince. That's who.

557
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:23,900
And how dare you listen in on a private conversation.

558
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:28,900
If you're going to be this rude, I'm simply going to leave.

559
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:32,900
So long chumps.

560
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:42,900
Hey, Valentina ran away.

561
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:53,900
I think we kind of missed the ball here.

562
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:56,900
But I better get moving too. Come on, let's get them.

563
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:04,900
Okay, give us a minute.

564
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:12,900
Yeah, it's a recovery.

565
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,900
I can't shave.

566
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:21,900
Yeah.

567
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:38,900
Oh.

568
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,900
Shit it!

569
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,420
Just one super camp.

570
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:14,900
Just 15, still my record is just 15.

571
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,900
Yay, level up!

572
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:50,900
Oops.

573
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,900
Nice.

574
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,900
Senpai!

575
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,900
Senpai, give me a sec.

576
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,900
Oh no!

577
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,900
Senpai, thank you!

578
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,900
Gryffin07 for remembering for one month.

579
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,900
Ten days late, but congrats on one month.

580
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,900
Looking forward to many more with

581
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,900
our favorite Kohai.

582
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,900
Thank you!

583
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,900
Okay.

584
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,900
Does anyone else

585
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,900
try to block the camp block attacks me

586
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,900
all the time?

587
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,900
Back to saving.

588
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,900
Yeah.

589
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:54,900
How do you my health be okay?

590
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,900
Okay.

591
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,900
Since there's a special enemy,

592
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,900
we gotta kill it specially!

593
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,900
I suck at that one.

594
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,900
Oh, I feel so bad that I don't,

595
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,900
I don't, you know.

596
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,900
I haven't gotten past 15 yet.

597
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,900
Okay.

598
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,900
How am I gonna get 30?

599
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,900
So hard!

600
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,900
Am I just gonna do Dino Blast?

601
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,900
Sorry.

602
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,900
No, I shouldn't be wasting F key,

603
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,900
but there's just so many of them.

604
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,900
Yes, hit yourself.

605
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,900
Why are you hitting yourself?

606
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,900
Why are you hitting yourself?

607
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,900
You know it's getting a little low.

608
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,900
How about he gets...

609
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,900
Oh, hi!

610
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,900
Oh, shit.

611
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,900
Man, I could've hit him,

612
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,900
but I was too slow.

613
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,900
Okay.

614
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,900
Okay.

615
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,900
Okay.

616
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,900
Hold on.

617
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,900
Drupalg.

618
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,900
Yeah.

619
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,900
I'm low on FP now.

620
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,900
Wait, where's that?

621
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,900
Where's that?

622
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,900
More clouds!

623
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,900
Hustbings are ahead,

624
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,900
but I only royal take and bathe here.

625
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,900
You don't look so royal.

626
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,900
Right now Prince Malo is bathing in the hustbings.

627
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,900
Must be so relaxing.

628
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,900
Don't tell me I have to go back up.

629
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,900
Queen Valentina.

630
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,900
Queen Valentina,

631
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,900
is the king shown any improvement?

632
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,900
And how has his wife failed queen?

633
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,900
And Prince Malo, is he well?

634
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,900
No one, I think, I think...

635
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,900
Not only that, but...

636
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,900
In furthermore...

637
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,900
But then...

638
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,900
Pipe down, all of you!

639
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,900
I have better things to do

640
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,900
than to listen to your half-wit opinions.

641
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,900
And look, while I've been wasting my time

642
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:26,900
listening to your endless chatter,

643
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,900
Mario has managed to find me.

644
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,900
Doodle doodle!

645
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,900
Oh, that bird has a permanent brain cramp.

646
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,900
Doodle, do you hear me?

647
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,900
Get over here now, I need some help

648
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,900
entertaining Mario.

649
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,900
Doodle, do you hear me?

650
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,900
Get over here now, I need some help

651
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,900
entertaining Mario.

652
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:49,900
Don't move it!

653
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,900
Come here now!

654
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,900
Holy shit, she's...

655
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,900
Doodle, doodle, come here in a minute!

656
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,900
Holy shit, she's a...

657
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,900
You know...

658
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,900
Snatched?

659
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,900
Super snatched.

660
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,900
Wait!

661
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:15,900
Gino!

662
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:20,900
Fine, so be it.

663
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,900
Die by the power of the sun!

664
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,900
Ugh.

665
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,900
Finally.

666
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,900
I'm done.

667
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,900
Girls, where are my rooms?

668
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,900
Ow.

669
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,900
Wait, it made a loud sound, but it didn't do that much.

670
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,900
We're okay.

671
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,900
Sorry, I need FB.

672
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,900
Ow.

673
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,900
I got bitch slapped.

674
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:25,900
Man.

675
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,900
I like this one.

676
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,900
Ooh.

677
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,900
Oh, she's resistant to it!

678
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,900
Ow.

679
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,900
Maybe you'll get over this?

680
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,900
Oh shit, I fell asleep.

681
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,900
Gotta heal up.

682
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,900
Mario.

683
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:31,900
Dang it!

684
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,900
Why are you always falling asleep?

685
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:03,900
EEEEEE

686
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:51,140
Not at all. How could you lose already? Oh, come on, get over here.

687
01:39:51,140 --> 01:40:01,140
I hit Valentina first. Well, it looks like I couldn't pick anyone else.

688
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:41,140
I don't have a lot of stuff.

689
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:52,140
Oh well, here we go. Oh, I got a freebie. Never mind, we're good.

690
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:38,140
Dang it.

691
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:48,140
Wow, it sucks.

692
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:36,140
Oh, I can actually hit Dota.

693
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:46,140
Oh, I can actually hit Dota. Okay.

694
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:16,140
Dang it.

695
01:43:36,140 --> 01:44:05,140
Come on, group hug.

696
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:21,140
There we go.

697
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:47,140
Come on, only 10.

698
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:57,140
Come on, group hug.

699
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:39,140
That was a lot of damage, yeah.

700
01:45:39,140 --> 01:46:01,140
Okay, let's go after her. I know she has the key.

701
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:18,140
Oh, he's got a parasol. Oh, is that Peach's parasol?

702
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:24,140
Woohoo! Wahoo! I mean, wahoo!

703
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:31,140
Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Mario and my other travel companions.

704
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:37,140
I say, how can we ever thank you enough? I'm Malo's father, King Nimbus.

705
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:43,140
Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for looking after my dear child.

706
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:51,140
Please allow me to introduce everyone. This is Princess Peach from the Mushroom Kingdom.

707
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:57,140
Ah, I've heard so much about you. May I have your autograph?

708
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:03,140
Don't embarrass us, junior dear. Oh, never mind. And who's this gentleman here?

709
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:09,140
This is Mario. He helped me from the start.

710
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:17,140
You don't mean the Mario jumping Mario autograph, please? That's quite enough, dear.

711
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:26,140
Okay, okay. And how about showing me just a little jump? Tiny hop will do.

712
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:32,140
Yay! Oh, even Bowser's hearing. Oh, fantastic!

713
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:36,140
This is Bowser, leader of Bowser's minion.

714
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:42,140
Oh, another famous person! This is just too much. I must have your autograph.

715
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:46,140
Oh, not even a little scribble? Okay, okay.

716
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:52,140
And this is Gino, who came from the starry sky, like I told you before.

717
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:57,140
Oh, yes! That story about the star... her star way! How awful!

718
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:00,140
That's... that star road.

719
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:08,140
Oh, right. Speaking of stars, a little while ago, a large star fell into the volcano.

720
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:12,140
I passed one of the star pieces. Hmm.

721
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:19,140
But the dreaded s-sarr-sarr-dre-sarr?

722
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:26,140
Dragon inhabits the volcano. It's gonna be tough getting a star out of there.

723
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:33,140
Perhaps all of you working together could handle the beast. Why, when I was young, I...

724
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:39,140
Yes, dear. Now, once at the volcano, find Cinder Toad. He'll be able to help you.

725
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:43,140
Before you go to the volcano, you ought to take a dip in our hot spring out back.

726
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:49,140
They're the pride of Nimbus Land. You be careful, everyone.

727
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:53,140
Okay, but we'll probably won't come back until we find the star.

728
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:58,140
I want... I want the hot spring.

729
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:02,140
Son, you're just like me when I was your age. I'm proud of you.

730
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:09,140
Well, I bet you'd enjoy the hot spring just as I did as a boy. Reach them through the back door here.

731
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:17,140
If you have any problems, come straight back, okay? We'll do whatever we can to help.

732
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:21,140
Star, right?

733
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:28,140
I want it again.

734
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:32,140
Wait, give me this...

735
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:45,140
Wait, am I supposed to fall again?

736
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:52,140
Aw, man.

737
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:08,140
Where are those treasures? Did I get them already?

738
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:13,140
The head are the hot springs, but only royalty is allowed.

739
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:16,140
Yep, you're the real prince! Sorry about the misunderstanding before.

740
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:19,140
There's no way that giant bird could have been a prince, huh?

741
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:23,140
No big deal, anyway. Do you think you can let us through here?

742
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:25,140
Of course!

743
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:29,140
Go right ahead. Please enjoy yourselves. Be careful not to fall into the volcano.

744
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:38,140
Wait, hold up.

745
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:40,140
Before I can...

746
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:43,140
There's something else I can get in town.

747
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,140
Wah!

748
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:57,140
What is it?

749
01:50:57,140 --> 01:51:02,140
Did you get the seed and fertilizer? I have a seed!

750
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:07,140
Walk to the edge of town. This way?

751
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:16,140
Oh yeah, I saw Valentina go towards the building to the south. Wonder why.

752
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:28,140
Oh, oh, busted! What do I do? What do I do?

753
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:31,140
I'll give you this fertilizer if you let me go, okay?

754
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:34,140
Got fertilizer.

755
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:38,140
Can I go further?

756
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:43,140
How did that happen?

757
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:49,140
Building south, right?

758
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:57,140
Guys!

759
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:03,140
Guys, it's the thief!

760
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:07,140
What do I do? He's gonna steal my money!

761
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:10,140
Fuck you!

762
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:16,140
Hey, hey, we meet again. This here land is rich. It's got lots of loot, and I want it all.

763
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:20,140
Hey, I'm not sweating this device will tell me where the treasure is hidden.

764
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:24,140
Rest of them are mine! All mine! Adios, fools!

765
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:28,140
Oh, thanks. Found an echo signal. If you could fit.

766
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:32,140
I'll tell you the location of the hidden treasure.

767
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:39,140
You know Ring will let you know when there's a treasure near. Has no effect when not equipped.

768
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:46,140
Ow, give me a second.

769
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:52,140
So how does it work?

770
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:01,140
Do I... Does it just tell me?

771
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:06,140
Not yet.

772
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:27,140
So I should just wear it when I'm like in overworld stuff?

773
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:39,140
Okay, it's automatic. Okay, just gotta make sure to change it after.

774
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:42,140
What's this?

775
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:04,140
Oh, it's back to the overworld.

776
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:13,140
I want, I want to go to the hot spring, though.

777
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:25,140
He's got so much stuff.

778
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:36,140
Oh? In this window?

779
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:39,140
In this window?

780
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:48,140
Like around here?

781
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:04,140
Ah! Wow! It worked!

782
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:10,140
Oh, look! Oh, look! Everyone has a statue!

783
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:18,140
This statue seems all unworldly.

784
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:22,140
And to see the King's statue collection, I tell you, it's remarkable.

785
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:26,140
It's making a beeping sound as if it's the King's statue collection.

786
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:30,140
It's making a beeping sound as if it's the King's statue collection.

787
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:33,140
Ah!

788
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:54,140
It's making a beeping sound as if it's down here.

789
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:04,140
Oh, no!

790
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:11,140
Is it on top of the other box?

791
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:14,140
Dang it.

792
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:17,140
Oh, look!

793
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:31,140
How tricky of them!

794
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:40,140
Let's see the room here. Let me get to see the room here.

795
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:43,140
Hi! I'm able to serve the King again, but we left our houses wide open.

796
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:45,140
Hope everything's alright.

797
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:48,140
You gave me another job as a guard.

798
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:51,140
Good smell! Come by!

799
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:54,140
Thank you for the soup!

800
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:58,140
$2 Super Roast Town has an unlocked path.

801
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:01,140
A seed for fertilizer. Okay, I'll get up there soon.

802
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:04,140
So much! You were able to rescue my father.

803
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:07,140
The key you gave us. Don't mention it.

804
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:10,140
You rescued him.

805
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:16,140
Thank you zero zero seven bond six two for for joining a snippet.

806
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:19,140
Snippet memba tier. Thank you.

807
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:22,140
You too.

808
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:25,140
Prince.

809
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:28,140
Here it is from here. This is for me. Please take it.

810
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:32,140
Got our jar. Thank you.

811
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:36,140
You know that there are hot springs around here?

812
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:38,140
Yep.

813
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:40,140
Oh, you're no fun. I want to be the first to tell you.

814
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:43,140
You did tell me before.

815
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:48,140
Our jar. Yeah. Yeah.

816
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:56,140
You're looking especially fluffy today, Prince.

817
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:59,140
Yeah.

818
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:06,140
Wee.

819
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:10,140
Pleasure.

820
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:14,140
Pleasure.

821
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:21,140
Oh.

822
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:37,140
Scenic route was worth it. I think so.

823
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:48,140
She's surrounded.

824
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:53,140
Danger beyond the edge is the volcano.

825
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,140
Oh.

826
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:59,140
This is nice.

827
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:02,140
Oh.

828
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:11,140
Should I go there first or?

829
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:17,140
Should I go to Rosetown first and get the thing or go to the volcano right away?

830
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:24,140
Rosetown first. Okay.

831
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:32,140
Hmm.

832
01:59:36,140 --> 01:59:40,140
Was this one? Yeah.

833
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:48,140
Wee.

834
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:51,140
Wrong way. This way.

835
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:58,140
Rosetown. Here it is.

836
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:12,140
New path. Oh, is this it?

837
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:15,140
Okay.

838
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:19,140
Got any cool stuff here?

839
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:25,140
Can I jump into the skies?

840
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:28,140
House.

841
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:31,140
Aye. I'm the gardener.

842
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:35,140
See that huge planner? I spent many years seeking the legendary seed and fertilizer.

843
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:38,140
Well, Phil, but it had no luck.

844
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:40,140
Well, I could find them.

845
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:43,140
Oh, incredible. I do believe that's the legendary fast-growing seed.

846
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:46,140
It was the enormous plant that seized my energy to change my life.

847
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:49,140
It was the youth when I was looking at the one day of my climb on my own.

848
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:52,140
I traveled all the world, scoured the library for it, and then in the end,

849
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:55,140
they said none of it was the youth's seed from the filling of the gardener.

850
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:58,140
It was the utmost important to me. I insisted.

851
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:01,140
Despite it headed over, really.

852
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:04,140
I can't read that fast, sorry.

853
02:01:04,140 --> 02:01:07,140
Hey, I haven't finished yet.

854
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:10,140
That's my story. Will you give me the seed?

855
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:13,140
Sure. I finally have it.

856
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:16,140
It's extraordinary. I can't believe it.

857
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:18,140
This is a quick-acting fertilizer to Steve River.

858
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:20,140
I thought I would search it high and low in the world,

859
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:22,140
but it never came to find it, though.

860
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:25,140
I explored the cave to make contact with the beds of a clown in the bean valley

861
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:28,140
and hopefully to further utilize this national chance.

862
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:30,140
Exaggerating when I say,

863
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:33,140
I've realized their long-lived agreement of gardener paramount to the day.

864
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:36,140
Really, something. I can't do it.

865
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:40,140
Shall I attention span?

866
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:42,140
I'd say.

867
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:44,140
Yeah, you can have the fertilizer, too.

868
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:48,140
Thank you. I finally have both the seed and the fertilizer.

869
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,140
I'll try them out right away.

870
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:56,140
Plant the seed.

871
02:01:56,140 --> 02:01:58,140
Give it fertilizer.

872
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:01,140
Nothing's happening.

873
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:04,140
Oh!

874
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:06,140
Oh, wow.

875
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:08,140
This is amazing.

876
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:10,140
Finally, my long-lived agreement of gardener paramount

877
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:12,140
if I would describe my feeling right now,

878
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:14,140
it would be a million against one. No, that's not quite right.

879
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:16,140
It's nothing. The bait and dame is giving me the mere words

880
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:18,140
but not suffice to extent that I've lost track of what I'm saying.

881
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:20,140
It's seemingly close to certain of the truth that no one would be able to suppress

882
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:22,140
the overwhelming feeling coming into possession of the planter.

883
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:24,140
It was not easy to believe,

884
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:26,140
but the plan was big enough, magnificent planter of my own dives.

885
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:28,140
Cannot get through as good enough

886
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:31,140
until I will be positive green with envy.

887
02:02:31,140 --> 02:02:33,140
Anyways, yeah.

888
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:35,140
I think I could use a little more fertilizer.

889
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:37,140
Maybe not, huh?

890
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:43,140
This won't get me in half

891
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:45,140
the gardener monthly magazine.

892
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:55,140
I literally just went,

893
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:57,140
because there are some parts I couldn't read.

894
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:59,140
Oh, stop.

895
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:02,140
That's a lazy shell.

896
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:05,140
That's a lazy shell.

897
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:07,140
There's two of them?

898
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:22,140
Oh, who wears the armor then?

899
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:33,140
Well, here you go.

900
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:35,140
Wear the lazy dress.

901
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:43,140
Ooh, how nice.

902
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:51,140
We did it.

903
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:53,140
Oh, looks like I can just go like that.

904
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:01,140
Is there anything else?

905
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:08,140
Is there anything else?

906
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:18,140
Ooh, I didn't...

907
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:31,140
Aw, skid.

908
02:04:35,140 --> 02:04:37,140
Do we need anything else now?

909
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:47,140
Aw, skid.

910
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:57,140
Do we need anything else now?

911
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:02,140
Probably not, huh?

912
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:07,140
We can go back to Booster Tower for a scene.

913
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:09,140
Booster Tower.

914
02:05:11,140 --> 02:05:13,140
Booster Tower.

915
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:18,140
We found the Link in Samus, Camille?

916
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:21,140
No?

917
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:32,140
Hee hee.

918
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:47,140
Ooh, hitting treasure.

919
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:49,140
Ow.

920
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:53,140
Ooh!

921
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:01,140
Yay!

922
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:21,140
Yay!

923
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,140
Yay!

924
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:29,140
Booster Tower again?

925
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:48,140
Nothing.

926
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:54,140
Shit.

927
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:00,140
There we go.

928
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:05,140
There we go.

929
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:11,140
I don't remember this guy.

930
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:13,140
I don't remember this guy. Who is this?

931
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:15,140
Who is this?

932
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:19,140
Hee hee.

933
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:21,140
Really sorry about before.

934
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:23,140
Here, I'll make it up to you. Hee ha.

935
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:25,140
We haven't find yet. Hee hee hee.

936
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:28,140
That was just practice. Time for real.

937
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:30,140
Up to it. Hee hee.

938
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:37,140
Do I fight him again?

939
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:39,140
Is he gonna be ridiculously hard?

940
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:51,140
I didn't save.

941
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:57,140
Okay, sure.

942
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:59,140
Guess which hand.

943
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:01,140
The yellow ball is in.

944
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:03,140
If you can.

945
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:05,140
If you can, now watch carefully.

946
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:11,140
Which hand, ball, is it?

947
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:13,140
Touch the hand you think is holding in this one.

948
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:15,140
Very good, he's a prize for the winner.

949
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:17,140
I don't know, well it's true.

950
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:19,140
Oh cool, anything else?

951
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:31,140
Is it this one?

952
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:33,140
Yeah.

953
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:35,140
Oh cool, I'm getting good use to this.

954
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:37,140
Okay.

955
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:45,140
Back to this one, right?

956
02:08:45,140 --> 02:08:47,140
Yeah.

957
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:49,140
Hee hee hee.

958
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:51,140
How many times can I do this?

959
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:53,140
How many times can I do this?

960
02:09:03,140 --> 02:09:05,140
Oh no, I missed it.

961
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:07,140
This one? Hee hee wrong.

962
02:09:09,140 --> 02:09:11,140
This hand, you lose. Let's do it again sometimes.

963
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:13,140
Oh well.

964
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:15,140
Oops, I missed that one.

965
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:17,140
Hee hee.

966
02:09:19,140 --> 02:09:21,140
No penalty, yeah.

967
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:29,140
Remember to respect your elders.

968
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:35,140
Can't I just go in again?

969
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:37,140
Yeah.

970
02:09:45,140 --> 02:09:47,140
Wait, if I beat it like 12 times,

971
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:49,140
I get a membership?

972
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:51,140
Hold up.

973
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:07,140
Yay.

974
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:17,140
Oh.

975
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:39,140
Gambling.

976
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:41,140
But not really because I'm watching where the ball goes.

977
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:47,140
Rotten mush.

978
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:59,140
Oops, wrong hand.

979
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:17,140
How many times?

980
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:41,140
How many times has it been?

981
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:47,140
No penalty.

982
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:01,140
Oops.

983
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:17,140
How many times has it been?

984
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:19,140
No penalty.

985
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:21,140
How many times has it been?

986
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:23,140
How many times has it been?

987
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:25,140
How many times has it been?

988
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:27,140
How many times has it been?

989
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:29,140
How many times has it been?

990
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:31,140
How many times has it been?

991
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:33,140
How many times has it been?

992
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:35,140
How many times has it been?

993
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,140
How many times has it been?

994
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:39,140
How many times has it been?

995
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:41,140
How many times has it been?

996
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:43,140
How many times has it been?

997
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:45,140
How many times has it been?

998
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:47,140
How many times has it been?

999
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:49,140
How many times has it been?

1000
02:12:49,140 --> 02:12:51,140
How many times has it been?

1001
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:53,140
Whoa! We did it!

1002
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:11,140
What was that?

1003
02:13:11,140 --> 02:13:13,140
Oh, there was...

1004
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:15,140
Alright, there's a light.

1005
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:24,140
Go gambling!

1006
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:29,140
Huh?

1007
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:37,140
Huh! Yay!

1008
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:39,140
Oh!

1009
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:50,140
Oh!

1010
02:13:57,140 --> 02:13:58,140
I'm still bad.

1011
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:10,140
Don't need to figure out how this one.

1012
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:27,140
Okay, gotta work on the timing.

1013
02:14:32,140 --> 02:14:34,140
Huge!

1014
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:39,140
Okay.

1015
02:15:03,140 --> 02:15:04,140
Oh, okay, I got...

1016
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:05,140
Ooh, 420!

1017
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:06,140
Blaze it!

1018
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:09,140
Ha ha ha!

1019
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:31,140
I forgot how this one goes.

1020
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:35,140
Okay.

1021
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:40,140
Whee!

1022
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:50,140
Totally forgot how to do this.

1023
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:09,140
Okay.

1024
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:24,140
Yes!

1025
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:30,140
This way?

1026
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:35,140
I can't remember which way it is.

1027
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:39,140
Okay.

1028
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:44,140
Oops.

1029
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:09,140
No.

1030
02:17:10,140 --> 02:17:13,140
You know why, since I was here, yeah.

1031
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:15,140
Okay.

1032
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:37,140
Bitch slap!

1033
02:17:37,140 --> 02:17:39,140
Shit.

1034
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:45,140
Okay.

1035
02:17:54,140 --> 02:17:56,140
Whee! Yesee!

1036
02:18:00,140 --> 02:18:02,140
I can't remember.

1037
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:04,140
Oops.

1038
02:18:04,140 --> 02:18:06,140
Okay.

1039
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:13,140
Am I getting it?

1040
02:18:13,140 --> 02:18:15,140
I just follow it.

1041
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:16,140
I don't know.

1042
02:18:16,140 --> 02:18:18,140
It's not moving that fast in my opinion.

1043
02:18:18,140 --> 02:18:20,140
Ha ha ha!

1044
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:30,140
I love this one.

1045
02:18:34,140 --> 02:18:36,140
Okay.

1046
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:45,140
Ooh!

1047
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:47,140
Senpai!

1048
02:18:51,140 --> 02:18:54,140
Thank you all for the 5 Super Innochi.

1049
02:18:54,140 --> 02:18:58,140
Also, I think you should be able to acquire the Iron Slash Metal Plate from Movil now.

1050
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:00,140
It's Peach's best weapon.

1051
02:19:00,140 --> 02:19:02,140
Okay, thank you.

1052
02:19:04,140 --> 02:19:06,140
Okay.

1053
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:13,140
Oops.

1054
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:19,140
Is it on there again?

1055
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:29,140
That was really close to here.

1056
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:35,140
Not on top of the box again, is it?

1057
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:43,140
Oops.

1058
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:47,140
Is it?

1059
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:51,140
Oh, this is gonna be hard. I'm not good at platforming.

1060
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:53,140
Why?

1061
02:20:00,140 --> 02:20:02,140
What?

1062
02:20:20,140 --> 02:20:23,140
I don't know if I can jump on it.

1063
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:31,140
Okay.

1064
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:40,140
I did it!

1065
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:42,140
Now where's the other one?

1066
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:53,140
Ah!

1067
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:55,140
Got it!

1068
02:20:59,140 --> 02:21:01,140
Okay.

1069
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:08,140
What are you babbling about?

1070
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:09,140
Wait, what?

1071
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:11,140
Valentina's here?

1072
02:21:11,140 --> 02:21:13,140
Why should I marry you?

1073
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:23,140
What a wonderful thing to say.

1074
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:33,140
What are you whispering about?

1075
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:43,140
What do I do?

1076
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:49,140
Are they getting married?

1077
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:02,140
You just leave them be, okay.

1078
02:22:08,140 --> 02:22:11,140
Oh, I just have to climb all the way back down now?

1079
02:22:11,140 --> 02:22:13,140
Ow, I forgot about you.

1080
02:22:29,140 --> 02:22:31,140
Oops.

1081
02:22:50,140 --> 02:22:52,140
I'm trying to go.

1082
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:57,140
Oh!

1083
02:22:59,140 --> 02:23:01,140
Okay.

1084
02:23:10,140 --> 02:23:13,140
I almost thought I didn't get it that time.

1085
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:15,140
Oh, I've already been here.

1086
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:45,140
Ow.

1087
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:04,140
Still gotta learn how to do it better.

1088
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:15,140
Okay.

1089
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:21,140
Okay.

1090
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:46,140
Gotta get out of here.

1091
02:24:56,140 --> 02:24:58,140
Oops.

1092
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:00,140
Okay.

1093
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:11,140
Mercy is a god tier Mario gamer.

1094
02:25:11,140 --> 02:25:14,140
I think that's the only thing I'm good at in Mario.

1095
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:16,140
Or okay at in Mario.

1096
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:18,140
Is the,

1097
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:24,140
Is the, what's the word?

1098
02:25:24,140 --> 02:25:26,140
Is the,

1099
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:29,140
the sort of item.

1100
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:32,140
Check out where the item is.

1101
02:25:48,140 --> 02:25:50,140
Okay, so it was Movil, right?

1102
02:25:50,140 --> 02:25:52,140
Movil's this way.

1103
02:25:52,140 --> 02:25:54,140
Wow, I'm so slow.

1104
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:02,140
This shop?

1105
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:06,140
This is the rest shop.

1106
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:10,140
This one?

1107
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:14,140
Good to see you.

1108
02:26:14,140 --> 02:26:16,140
I'll show you my inventory.

1109
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:18,140
Item number one, a lucky jewel.

1110
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:20,140
Sure to bring you plenty of good luck.

1111
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:22,140
I'll set to you for 100 points.

1112
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:24,140
Should I get it? No.

1113
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:32,140
Number two, a mystery egg.

1114
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:34,140
I have no idea what it does.

1115
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:36,140
It sort of grows on you, huh?

1116
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:38,140
Guys for 200.

1117
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:40,140
Uh, no thanks.

1118
02:26:40,140 --> 02:26:42,140
Number three, a feather.

1119
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:44,140
Just fell right off from the sky all of a sudden.

1120
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:46,140
I picked up it off from the ground, but it's real jam.

1121
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:50,140
No.

1122
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:52,140
All I got for now.

1123
02:26:52,140 --> 02:26:54,140
Well, I didn't see metal anything.

1124
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:00,140
Is it here?

1125
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:06,140
No.

1126
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:08,140
Nope.

1127
02:27:10,140 --> 02:27:12,140
No, he has it?

1128
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:16,140
No.

1129
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:24,140
Oh, did I not get it yet?

1130
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:26,140
Did he not get it yet?

1131
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:30,140
Senpai.

1132
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:32,140
Senpai.

1133
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:36,140
Thank you, you know,

1134
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:38,140
GA again for the two.

1135
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:40,140
Unless, might be after the barrel, but you know, I apologize.

1136
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:42,140
It's okay.

1137
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:44,140
We got our best.

1138
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:46,140
And now we're doing it again.

1139
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:56,140
What happened if I fall off here?

1140
02:27:58,140 --> 02:28:00,140
Oh, money.

1141
02:28:12,140 --> 02:28:14,140
I think this is the,

1142
02:28:14,140 --> 02:28:16,140
the evil one.

1143
02:28:20,140 --> 02:28:22,140
This one?

1144
02:28:24,140 --> 02:28:26,140
Oh yeah, this one.

1145
02:28:26,140 --> 02:28:28,140
The vines, the jump.

1146
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:30,140
I don't want to do it again.

1147
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:36,140
Senpai.

1148
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:38,140
One more thing.

1149
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:40,140
Do you have the shiny stone?

1150
02:28:40,140 --> 02:28:42,140
I'm not in the monster town yet.

1151
02:28:42,140 --> 02:28:44,140
Yeah, and he beat my ass so badly.

1152
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:48,140
He beat my ass real badly,

1153
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:50,140
and it really hurt.

1154
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:12,140
Ah!

1155
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:20,140
Ah!

1156
02:29:20,140 --> 02:29:22,140
It's Hal.

1157
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:24,140
Like it.

1158
02:29:34,140 --> 02:29:36,140
Ow!

1159
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:38,140
Ow!

1160
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:42,140
Ow!

1161
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:50,140
Oh, stop!

1162
02:29:56,140 --> 02:29:58,140
Ow!

1163
02:30:04,140 --> 02:30:06,140
Oops.

1164
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:12,140
Bitch slap.

1165
02:30:16,140 --> 02:30:18,140
I'm still needing to work on my,

1166
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:20,140
my timing for this.

1167
02:30:20,140 --> 02:30:22,140
I kind of suck at it.

1168
02:30:26,140 --> 02:30:28,140
Ah!

1169
02:30:28,140 --> 02:30:30,140
Ah!

1170
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:32,140
Ah!

1171
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:34,140
Ah!

1172
02:30:34,140 --> 02:30:36,140
Ah!

1173
02:30:38,140 --> 02:30:40,140
Yeah!

1174
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:48,140
Hey, let me jump on you.

1175
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:56,140
Dang it.

1176
02:30:56,140 --> 02:30:58,140
Why, why do you have so many?

1177
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:06,140
Ah!

1178
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:12,140
Yo-yo.

1179
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:36,140
There you go.

1180
02:31:36,140 --> 02:31:38,140
That was tough.

1181
02:31:54,140 --> 02:31:56,140
Maybe I should by beat him.

1182
02:32:04,140 --> 02:32:06,140
Donkey Kong, why are you here?

1183
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:30,140
It missed!

1184
02:32:30,140 --> 02:32:32,140
Oh!

1185
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:36,140
Oh, man.

1186
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:38,140
Oh, I missed.

1187
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:40,140
I'm getting more clumsy with my stuff.

1188
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:06,140
Goodbye, Donkey Kong.

1189
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:24,140
Ooh, level up.

1190
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:28,140
Step pie!

1191
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:30,140
Step pie!

1192
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:36,140
Okay, so Dark...

1193
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:38,140
Thank you, you know, T for the 10.

1194
02:33:38,140 --> 02:33:40,140
So Dark Mario Lore here.

1195
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:42,140
That is Nazi K. What?

1196
02:33:42,140 --> 02:33:46,140
In fact, that is one of the many Kongs that Mario imprisoned in the arcade days.

1197
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:48,140
He just let loose in the wild instead of putting it out of his misery.

1198
02:33:48,140 --> 02:33:50,140
What?

1199
02:33:50,140 --> 02:33:52,140
What the?

1200
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:54,140
What? Is this like a game theory?

1201
02:33:54,140 --> 02:33:56,140
Is this a game theory?

1202
02:33:58,140 --> 02:34:00,140
That's not hard.

1203
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:06,140
Wait, no, why?

1204
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:08,140
What do you mean it's not a game theory?

1205
02:34:08,140 --> 02:34:10,140
Not even joking?

1206
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:12,140
Wait, what?

1207
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:18,140
No, you're fucking with me.

1208
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:20,140
You're fucking with me now.

1209
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:24,140
Yeah, you're fucking with me.

1210
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:26,140
I knew it.

1211
02:34:26,140 --> 02:34:28,140
I knew it.

1212
02:34:28,140 --> 02:34:30,140
You shouldn't...

1213
02:34:30,140 --> 02:34:32,140
You shouldn't tell me things like that.

1214
02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:34,140
I'll believe you.

1215
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:40,140
I'll believe you because I'm gullible.

1216
02:34:58,140 --> 02:35:00,140
That is a very funny game theory, though.

1217
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:10,140
I never tell you some pies that I hate ants.

1218
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:30,140
I hate ants specifically because last year...

1219
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:32,140
Was it last year or is it this year?

1220
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:34,140
Oh man, I can't remember.

1221
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:36,140
Things are just a blur now.

1222
02:35:40,140 --> 02:35:42,140
I'm pretty sure it was last year.

1223
02:35:42,140 --> 02:35:44,140
Yes, it was last year.

1224
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:46,140
I went to Vietnam.

1225
02:35:46,140 --> 02:35:48,140
And...

1226
02:35:48,140 --> 02:35:50,140
I got attacked by fire ants.

1227
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:54,140
Mind you, I'm gonna tell you some pie.

1228
02:35:54,140 --> 02:35:58,140
I have unlocked new trauma that I never thought I would unlock in my entire life.

1229
02:35:58,140 --> 02:36:00,140
And that's being...

1230
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:04,140
Getting crawled all over

1231
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:06,140
by a bunch of fire ants

1232
02:36:06,140 --> 02:36:08,140
and being bitten by ants.

1233
02:36:08,140 --> 02:36:10,140
That's a...

1234
02:36:16,140 --> 02:36:18,140
That's a...

1235
02:36:18,140 --> 02:36:20,140
That is like being surrounded

1236
02:36:20,140 --> 02:36:22,140
and like crawled all over.

1237
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:24,140
Yeah, that was awful.

1238
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:26,140
I was bit everywhere.

1239
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:28,140
It was...

1240
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:30,140
It was painful and I hated it.

1241
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:32,140
And now I have a big

1242
02:36:32,140 --> 02:36:34,140
disgusting hate for ants.

1243
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:36,140
I hate ants.

1244
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:38,140
Like, a lot now.

1245
02:36:42,140 --> 02:36:46,140
Thank you for the 333 tip, tiny spiny.

1246
02:36:46,140 --> 02:36:48,140
Yeah, that's not their real lore.

1247
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:50,140
Nor is it even applied.

1248
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:52,140
He's just wrong.

1249
02:36:52,140 --> 02:36:54,140
It's a fun little...

1250
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:56,140
It's a fun little...

1251
02:36:56,140 --> 02:36:58,140
Just a fun little thing, some pies.

1252
02:36:58,140 --> 02:37:00,140
Just a fun little game theory.

1253
02:37:04,140 --> 02:37:06,140
Anyways, I hate ants.

1254
02:37:08,140 --> 02:37:10,140
They're good for the environment.

1255
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:12,140
They're very strong, but...

1256
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:14,140
My gosh.

1257
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:16,140
So I hate them now.

1258
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:24,140
I hate ants.

1259
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:30,140
I hate ants.

1260
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:38,140
Like, yeah, I don't like ants.

1261
02:37:38,140 --> 02:37:40,140
For that very reason.

1262
02:37:46,140 --> 02:37:48,140
Shit.

1263
02:37:52,140 --> 02:37:54,140
Yay!

1264
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:56,140
Love walk.

1265
02:38:04,140 --> 02:38:06,140
The heck did I hit anyways?

1266
02:38:22,140 --> 02:38:24,140
Okay, what? Okay, good question.

1267
02:38:26,140 --> 02:38:28,140
Why are there so many special enemies right now?

1268
02:38:52,140 --> 02:38:54,140
Step 5!

1269
02:39:10,140 --> 02:39:12,140
Thank you, Inochi for the 5!

1270
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:16,140
But serious!

1271
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:18,140
It is a strong believed and theorized

1272
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:20,140
that it is in fact one of the

1273
02:39:20,140 --> 02:39:23,520
I hate Mario in prison and Nintendo swapped that under the rug.

1274
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:26,520
Ahhhhhh!

1275
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:28,520
Ahhhhhh!

1276
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:30,520
OK, senpai, don't fight, OK?

1277
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:32,520
Don't fight, don't fight, it's OK.

1278
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:33,620
It's OK, it's fun.

1279
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:34,620
I like to think of this.

1280
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:36,120
It's super, super fun.

1281
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:38,120
Ahhhhh!

1282
02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:41,120
Don't fight now!

1283
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:44,120
Don't fight!

1284
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:48,120
I like that, I like that thought.

1285
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:56,320
We got big Nintendo here doing a cover up on Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong clone.

1286
02:39:56,320 --> 02:40:01,440
Ha ha ha ha clone.

1287
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:07,920
I'm gonna switch out.

1288
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:35,120
I think it's fine, it's fine, it's fun!

1289
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:36,120
It's fun!

1290
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:38,120
Another one!

1291
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:04,120
Speak of the devil and they appear!

1292
02:41:04,120 --> 02:41:05,120
Mario!

1293
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:07,120
Thank you for the Tui no chi!

1294
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:20,120
Mario lore also says that brick blocks are toes.

1295
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:23,120
Brick blocks?

1296
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:28,120
Like...

1297
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:30,120
Wait!

1298
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:31,120
Hold up!

1299
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:33,120
There's a gr-

1300
02:41:33,120 --> 02:42:01,120
What the fuck are you?

1301
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:25,120
I'm useless without health.

1302
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:34,120
I got it!

1303
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:38,120
Aw man, this is gonna be rough.

1304
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:47,120
Fuck!

1305
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:50,120
Oh fuck.

1306
02:42:50,120 --> 02:43:14,120
Another one!

1307
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:43,120
Maybe I should attack one of these guys.

1308
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:49,120
I'm getting the timing so badly.

1309
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:52,120
Who said I was a gamer?

1310
02:43:52,120 --> 02:43:58,120
It fooled me to the beginning!

1311
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:25,120
We're fine!

1312
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:33,120
Wait, there's another one up there!

1313
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:34,120
Thank you for the Tui!

1314
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:39,120
Breaking brick blocks, it grows brutally, ending a toad's life.

1315
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:42,120
That's a lot of theories right now!

1316
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:44,120
It's fun!

1317
02:44:44,120 --> 02:44:45,120
It's fun!

1318
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:48,120
I wonder how you get it?

1319
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:50,120
Don't tell me.

1320
02:44:50,120 --> 02:45:01,120
I have to fall.

1321
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:14,120
There you go.

1322
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:19,120
I'm not gonna make it out of here without FP.

1323
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:27,120
This is really painful without FP.

1324
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:30,120
Senpai!

1325
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:31,120
Senpai!

1326
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:32,120
Thank you!

1327
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:36,120
Taigabia for the 53 tip.

1328
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:38,120
Tui's Mario lore.

1329
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:57,120
Mercial was moved as an alt character for being too cute.

1330
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:01,120
Wait, 3 something and you're not even dead?

1331
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:24,120
I forgot about this.

1332
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:26,120
Do I?

1333
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:28,120
Oh yeah.

1334
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:31,120
Fuck.

1335
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:33,120
Fuck, I'm stuck.

1336
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:53,120
Not again.

1337
02:46:53,120 --> 02:47:09,120
This is so much.

1338
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:12,120
Wait, does it always send me to the beginning?

1339
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:18,120
Fuck!

1340
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:20,120
Fuck!

1341
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:25,120
Fuck!

1342
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:36,120
Fuck!

1343
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:39,120
No!

1344
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:55,120
Please! Please!

1345
02:47:55,120 --> 02:48:17,120
It didn't even get any of me an exclamation mark.

1346
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:24,120
Whatever. Fuck it.

1347
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:39,120
How's that?

1348
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:48,120
I need FP.

1349
02:48:48,120 --> 02:49:14,120
This is bad.

1350
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:29,120
Oh, and my HP not great.

1351
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:35,120
Okay, here we go.

1352
02:49:35,120 --> 02:50:03,120
Bitch.

1353
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:31,120
I just don't think I...

1354
02:50:32,120 --> 02:50:34,120
Oh!

1355
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:37,120
Okay, that's not bad.

1356
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:51,120
I feel like I'm gonna get screwed soon.

1357
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:53,120
Man.

1358
02:50:54,120 --> 02:51:22,120
We're here, nothing.

1359
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:49,120
Oh, I'll revive him soon.

1360
02:51:49,120 --> 02:52:05,120
I'll revive him now.

1361
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:12,120
I'm doomed.

1362
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:24,120
Hold up.

1363
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:38,120
I can't remember what was good, the ghost medal. Yes.

1364
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:57,120
No.

1365
02:52:57,120 --> 02:53:13,120
I need switch.

1366
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:23,120
Fuck!

1367
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:35,120
He's gonna use Peach, but I don't have enough thingies.

1368
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:42,120
Here we go.

1369
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:49,120
Bracer? It's a bracer.

1370
02:53:49,120 --> 02:54:15,120
Should I put him into physical or magic? Maybe more magic?

1371
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:26,120
Oh, hi. Hold on.

1372
02:54:26,120 --> 02:54:30,120
Hey there. Those footsteps.

1373
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:33,120
Well, those footsteps were you for a minute. I thought I was hearing things.

1374
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:43,120
Cinder told, this place is a regular inferno. Come on, step inside.

1375
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:51,120
I'll come to the item shop.

1376
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:54,120
Just you?

1377
02:54:54,120 --> 02:55:00,120
Ian, 30 coins will get you a room.

1378
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:05,120
I can't stay all right.

1379
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:11,120
I need the armor.

1380
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:19,120
Probably, should I wear the armor?

1381
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:38,120
I don't know if these are worth it because some of these are put down.

1382
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:51,120
Oh no, this one doesn't look that good.

1383
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:56,120
And I need FB, so yeah, I'll sleep.

1384
02:55:56,120 --> 02:56:03,120
Great. I'll get everything ready for you.

1385
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:09,120
I'm just sleeping on the car, on the boxes!

1386
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:17,120
Now wasn't that a cushy bed?

1387
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:32,120
There are these.

1388
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:40,120
Do I need any more items?

1389
02:56:40,120 --> 02:56:51,120
I probably need these.

1390
02:56:51,120 --> 02:57:07,120
Yeah.

1391
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:10,120
Thanks for stopping that, but you can always come back, you know.

1392
02:57:10,120 --> 02:57:15,120
Aw, thanks.

1393
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:23,120
Lives here all by himself? Kind of sad.

1394
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:33,120
What do I do with all these flowers? Hold on.

1395
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:36,120
Aw man.

1396
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:44,120
Aw man.

1397
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:51,120
Aw man.

1398
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:24,120
Ah!

1399
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:34,120
Shit.

1400
02:58:44,120 --> 02:59:00,120
Shit.

1401
02:59:00,120 --> 02:59:05,120
Yay.

1402
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:17,120
Ah!

1403
02:59:17,120 --> 02:59:30,120
Oi.

1404
02:59:31,120 --> 02:59:38,120
Thank you, Joker, for remembering for one month a snippy memory tier.

1405
02:59:38,120 --> 02:59:40,120
I swear the Marseille Alpha gets more scuffed every stream.

1406
02:59:40,120 --> 02:59:42,120
What do you mean, more scuffed every stream?

1407
02:59:42,120 --> 02:59:44,120
It looks perfect!

1408
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:46,120
Ten-pecky!

1409
02:59:46,120 --> 03:00:11,120
Ah!

1410
03:00:11,120 --> 03:00:13,120
Never.

1411
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:18,120
This is my, this is my weakest genre.

1412
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:29,120
Ah!

1413
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:40,120
But I'm warming hard.

1414
03:00:40,120 --> 03:00:45,120
Look at the shadows, shadows, shadows.

1415
03:00:45,120 --> 03:01:00,120
Look at the shadows and everything went away!

1416
03:01:00,120 --> 03:01:07,120
We did it! We made it to the boss!

1417
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:29,120
He's really cute!

1418
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:35,120
That's the dragon!

1419
03:01:35,120 --> 03:01:40,120
Yeah, him!

1420
03:01:40,120 --> 03:01:44,120
I got this.

1421
03:01:44,120 --> 03:02:02,120
I think I got this.

1422
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:34,120
Oops.

1423
03:02:34,120 --> 03:02:45,120
Yeah. Fuck.

1424
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:48,120
Wait, I won? That was it?

1425
03:02:48,120 --> 03:02:51,120
No, there's more, right? There's a second round, right?

1426
03:02:51,120 --> 03:03:03,120
I knew it! I knew it! I knew that was a second round!

1427
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:19,120
Where is that pure water?

1428
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:22,120
Why didn't that work?

1429
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:24,120
Why didn't that work?

1430
03:03:24,120 --> 03:03:26,120
Why didn't that work?

1431
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:55,120
What am I supposed to do now?

1432
03:03:55,120 --> 03:03:57,120
Good weakness!

1433
03:03:57,120 --> 03:04:07,120
weakness found!

1434
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:19,120
Can't block it.

1435
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:37,120
Does that mean I can do this one?

1436
03:04:37,120 --> 03:04:42,120
Okay, I'm gonna need Bowser to...

1437
03:04:42,120 --> 03:04:45,120
No!

1438
03:04:45,120 --> 03:04:55,120
Bowser, no!

1439
03:04:55,120 --> 03:05:10,120
Okay.

1440
03:05:10,120 --> 03:05:15,120
Bowser, I don't want Bowser to die!

1441
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:23,120
Oh wait, he's okay.

1442
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:26,120
Here!

1443
03:05:26,120 --> 03:05:36,120
We got it!

1444
03:05:36,120 --> 03:05:41,120
Wait, what the fuck?

1445
03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:45,120
Wait, that's mine!

1446
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:50,120
We got the star!

1447
03:05:50,120 --> 03:05:54,120
Amazing.

1448
03:05:54,120 --> 03:05:58,120
We're unbeatable!

1449
03:05:58,120 --> 03:06:02,120
Gorgeous!

1450
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:06,120
You better leave now, chumps.

1451
03:06:06,120 --> 03:06:11,120
No, wait, wait! My star! My star! Give it back!

1452
03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:19,120
What the fuck? I worked so hard for that!

1453
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:27,120
Hey Red, look down there! That's gotta be the ugliest mustache I've ever seen!

1454
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:30,120
Yo, girls!

1455
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:35,120
That guy's worse looking than that Claude Mario!

1456
03:06:35,120 --> 03:06:38,120
That IS Mario, you idiot!

1457
03:06:38,120 --> 03:06:44,120
Listen everyone, we gotta get the star to the blade immediately! We'll deal with Mario later!

1458
03:06:44,120 --> 03:06:52,120
My star! My star! My star! My star!

1459
03:06:52,120 --> 03:06:55,120
My star, come on!

1460
03:06:55,120 --> 03:06:59,120
Hey Red, careful with this, you're all thumbs!

1461
03:06:59,120 --> 03:07:03,120
Give it back! Wait, the game is back!

1462
03:07:03,120 --> 03:07:06,120
What the fuck?

1463
03:07:06,120 --> 03:07:13,120
None of them will be! I mean, none of them page!

1464
03:07:13,120 --> 03:07:18,120
What the fuck?

1465
03:07:18,120 --> 03:07:23,120
What the fuck?

1466
03:07:23,120 --> 03:07:28,120
What the fuck?

1467
03:07:28,120 --> 03:07:33,120
What the fuck?

1468
03:07:33,120 --> 03:07:38,120
What the fuck?

1469
03:07:38,120 --> 03:07:42,120
Where's the blade?

1470
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:49,120
Wait, what do you mean I have like three different boss fights? What the hell? That's just rude.

1471
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:53,120
Back in the day, this is where I quit. I saved in a bad spot.

1472
03:07:53,120 --> 03:07:57,120
I hope I'm okay.

1473
03:07:57,120 --> 03:08:01,120
It'll be here. Are you sure?

1474
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:04,120
Relax people!

1475
03:08:04,120 --> 03:08:07,120
Mario! Mario's here!

1476
03:08:07,120 --> 03:08:09,120
Too late.

1477
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:12,120
Where's the blade?

1478
03:08:12,120 --> 03:08:18,120
Shut up already!

1479
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:20,120
Finally!

1480
03:08:20,120 --> 03:08:27,120
Wait, give it back!

1481
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:33,120
This is Power Rangers! We fight for evil!

1482
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:38,120
We live for disorder!

1483
03:08:38,120 --> 03:08:42,120
We like what we do!

1484
03:08:42,120 --> 03:08:46,120
We struggle for chaos!

1485
03:08:46,120 --> 03:08:50,120
We are...

1486
03:08:50,120 --> 03:08:54,120
The Axe of Rangers!

1487
03:08:54,120 --> 03:09:00,120
Star peace gives people hope! It needs to be destroyed!

1488
03:09:08,120 --> 03:09:19,120
Alright.

1489
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:25,120
You know what this means, pals.

1490
03:09:25,120 --> 03:09:29,120
We kill the pink one first. She heals.

1491
03:09:29,120 --> 03:09:37,120
We kill the pink one because she heals!

1492
03:09:39,120 --> 03:09:44,120
We kill the pink one! The pink one goals!

1493
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:50,120
Fuck.

1494
03:09:50,120 --> 03:09:54,120
Fuck.

1495
03:10:09,120 --> 03:10:15,120
I'm gonna need Peach here.

1496
03:10:23,120 --> 03:10:29,120
We're good!

1497
03:10:29,120 --> 03:10:36,120
Aw, man.

1498
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:42,120
Am I always missing?

1499
03:10:42,120 --> 03:10:47,120
You're dead!

1500
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:52,120
What? My makeup's running!

1501
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:57,120
And change brands!

1502
03:10:57,120 --> 03:11:02,120
You're dead!

1503
03:11:02,120 --> 03:11:07,120
You're dead!

1504
03:11:07,120 --> 03:11:11,120
You're dead!

1505
03:11:12,120 --> 03:11:18,120
Good plug.

1506
03:11:28,120 --> 03:11:37,120
Aw, man.

1507
03:11:37,120 --> 03:11:41,120
Like, can I not hit the girl?

1508
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:48,120
I want him gone then.

1509
03:11:48,120 --> 03:11:57,120
Yo, Ren, what? Not a headache. Totally out of shape!

1510
03:12:08,120 --> 03:12:22,120
I always miss you, so...

1511
03:12:22,120 --> 03:12:29,120
Aw, man.

1512
03:12:37,120 --> 03:12:44,120
Yo, Ren, what? I'm hungry.

1513
03:12:44,120 --> 03:12:50,120
Chew on your tongue!

1514
03:12:50,120 --> 03:12:55,120
Yo, Ren, what? I'm hungry.

1515
03:12:55,120 --> 03:13:01,120
Chew on your tongue!

1516
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:06,120
Yo, Ren.

1517
03:13:06,120 --> 03:13:10,120
Yo, Ren, what? I broke my shades.

1518
03:13:10,120 --> 03:13:16,120
Serves you right!

1519
03:13:36,120 --> 03:13:43,120
Okay.

1520
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:52,120
Enough now, I'm angry! I'm gonna finish this!

1521
03:13:52,120 --> 03:13:58,120
Formation Hall! Here we go!

1522
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:12,120
I'm gonna try this.

1523
03:14:26,120 --> 03:14:30,120
Dang it.

1524
03:14:30,120 --> 03:14:35,120
Force Beam Energize! Maximum Charge! Now!

1525
03:14:35,120 --> 03:14:39,120
Fire the Breaker!

1526
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:44,120
Aw, man.

1527
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:12,120
This isn't possible! We're invincible!

1528
03:15:12,120 --> 03:15:17,120
Can't be happening to the Axeum Rangers!

1529
03:15:17,120 --> 03:15:23,120
Woooah!

1530
03:15:23,120 --> 03:15:27,120
We only got 17 EXP for that?

1531
03:15:27,120 --> 03:15:32,120
Really?

1532
03:15:32,120 --> 03:15:38,120
We only got 17 for that?

1533
03:15:38,120 --> 03:15:45,120
Well, at least we got the star!

1534
03:15:45,120 --> 03:15:51,120
Yay, we got it!

1535
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:58,120
That means we only need one more!

1536
03:15:58,120 --> 03:16:03,120
Okay.

1537
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:07,120
Okay.

1538
03:16:07,120 --> 03:16:11,120
Okay.

1539
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:15,120
Okay.

1540
03:16:15,120 --> 03:16:20,120
Six Star Pieces have finally been collected.

1541
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:25,120
Where did the last star piece be?

1542
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:33,120
The last star piece was in your heart!

1543
03:16:33,120 --> 03:16:39,120
Oh, I'm going back to the other town.

1544
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:44,120
Okay.

1545
03:16:44,120 --> 03:16:49,120
Okay.

1546
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:54,120
Okay.

1547
03:16:54,120 --> 03:16:59,120
Okay.

1548
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:04,120
Okay.

1549
03:17:04,120 --> 03:17:09,120
Okay.

1550
03:17:09,120 --> 03:17:14,120
Nah.

1551
03:17:14,120 --> 03:17:19,120
Mystery Egg. I hate eggs.

1552
03:17:19,120 --> 03:17:24,120
No.

1553
03:17:24,120 --> 03:17:29,120
Metal Plate. Here it is. I'll take it.

1554
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:33,120
Nice job doing business with you. Here you go. That's all I got for now. Okay.

1555
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:40,120
That's... wait, a pip?

1556
03:17:40,120 --> 03:17:47,120
There we go.

1557
03:17:47,120 --> 03:17:54,120
Ah!

1558
03:17:54,120 --> 03:17:57,120
Now I need to save.

1559
03:17:57,120 --> 03:18:00,120
Now I can funk everyone with the...

1560
03:18:00,120 --> 03:18:05,120
Have you seen that one guy who's got a Swillings...

1561
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:10,120
Do you know Swillings, the brand Swillings?

1562
03:18:10,120 --> 03:18:15,120
Okay.

1563
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:18,120
Well, there's a brand called Swillings.

1564
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:23,120
I think it's a German brand, I think.

1565
03:18:23,120 --> 03:18:28,120
Anyways, the knife brand. Yeah, like the knife, but like it's...

1566
03:18:28,120 --> 03:18:32,120
I think it was a Swillings frying pan.

1567
03:18:32,120 --> 03:18:41,120
So, this guy said he beat the shit out of this burglar.

1568
03:18:41,120 --> 03:18:47,120
And he showed the pan and it looked in pristine condition and I was like,

1569
03:18:47,120 --> 03:18:52,120
that's one way to sell a frying pan.

1570
03:18:52,120 --> 03:18:54,120
Swilling, right?

1571
03:18:54,120 --> 03:18:56,120
Yeah, with the frying pan.

1572
03:18:56,120 --> 03:18:59,120
And it looked pristine.

1573
03:18:59,120 --> 03:19:14,120
I was like, wow, not even a dent or anything. That's like sturdy, wow.

1574
03:19:14,120 --> 03:19:16,120
I think it was a regular frying pan.

1575
03:19:16,120 --> 03:19:22,120
And I was like legitimately impressed by how well it stood up.

1576
03:19:22,120 --> 03:19:24,120
And I was like, wow, I might...

1577
03:19:24,120 --> 03:19:30,120
If I needed to, I could use...

1578
03:19:30,120 --> 03:19:33,120
I would buy a frying pan like that.

1579
03:19:33,120 --> 03:19:39,120
Now who do we ask?

1580
03:19:39,120 --> 03:20:04,120
We talk to the parents?

1581
03:20:04,120 --> 03:20:07,120
I need to talk to the parents? Where do I go now?

1582
03:20:07,120 --> 03:20:10,120
Nobody's in the place.

1583
03:20:10,120 --> 03:20:15,120
Frog fuchsious guy.

1584
03:20:15,120 --> 03:20:22,120
I have frog.

1585
03:20:22,120 --> 03:20:31,120
Also, where's the casino?

1586
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:50,120
Actually, I was right about the parents. I had to go to the parents.

1587
03:20:50,120 --> 03:20:56,120
What's the fastest way to the throne room?

1588
03:20:56,120 --> 03:21:02,120
Go through, right?

1589
03:21:02,120 --> 03:21:07,120
Immediately ask, where's the casino? Not addicted. I'm not addicted.

1590
03:21:07,120 --> 03:21:13,120
I just want to know.

1591
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:18,120
I like how there's like all these statues of us.

1592
03:21:18,120 --> 03:21:28,120
You're as endless. I'm canny.

1593
03:21:28,120 --> 03:21:32,120
Just curious.

1594
03:21:32,120 --> 03:21:35,120
Just curious, you know.

1595
03:21:35,120 --> 03:21:41,120
Don't you ever just want to know where the casino is?

1596
03:21:41,120 --> 03:21:43,120
Um, dad.

1597
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:46,120
Were you able to find the star, dear?

1598
03:21:46,120 --> 03:21:51,120
Yeah. The axon rangers took it away from us, but we got it back.

1599
03:21:51,120 --> 03:21:57,120
That's wonderful. Now the star, uh, the star way can be repaired, right?

1600
03:21:57,120 --> 03:22:01,120
I guess not. You're still missing a piece, I take it.

1601
03:22:01,120 --> 03:22:03,120
The last star?

1602
03:22:03,120 --> 03:22:08,120
Wait, the only place left to look is in Bowser's Keep.

1603
03:22:08,120 --> 03:22:13,120
Yeah, we know, but there's no way to get in. Believe me, we tried, but...

1604
03:22:13,120 --> 03:22:16,120
Yes, yes, even Mario can't jump that far.

1605
03:22:16,120 --> 03:22:18,120
All right, I'll let you use the...

1606
03:22:18,120 --> 03:22:23,120
That's it, dear. You should use the royal bus.

1607
03:22:23,120 --> 03:22:31,120
Yes, Malo, the time has come for you to take the bus.

1608
03:22:31,120 --> 03:22:38,120
Are they telling him to take the short bus?

1609
03:22:38,120 --> 03:22:45,120
Sorry, the way the nose goes down on my face is so funny.

1610
03:22:45,120 --> 03:22:48,120
I'm sorry.

1611
03:22:48,120 --> 03:22:50,120
I'm sorry.

1612
03:22:50,120 --> 03:22:52,120
I'm sorry.

1613
03:22:52,120 --> 03:22:54,120
I'm sorry.

1614
03:22:54,120 --> 03:22:56,120
I'm sorry.

1615
03:22:56,120 --> 03:22:58,120
I'm sorry.

1616
03:22:58,120 --> 03:23:00,120
I'm sorry.

1617
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:02,120
I'm sorry.

1618
03:23:02,120 --> 03:23:04,120
I'm sorry.

1619
03:23:04,120 --> 03:23:06,120
My face is so funny.

1620
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:28,120
Why when I was your age?

1621
03:23:28,120 --> 03:23:31,120
Really? Are you sure it's all right?

1622
03:23:31,120 --> 03:23:33,120
Of course, dear.

1623
03:23:33,120 --> 03:23:35,120
Wait, of course, dear.

1624
03:23:35,120 --> 03:23:39,120
I'll order the repairman to have it fixed up by the time you leave.

1625
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:44,120
You simply have to help Mario and the others get that last star.

1626
03:23:44,120 --> 03:23:46,120
You bet, Mom.

1627
03:23:46,120 --> 03:23:51,120
Come on, Mario, let's go.

1628
03:23:51,120 --> 03:23:55,120
I'm going to get this star strip fixed for...

1629
03:23:55,120 --> 03:23:58,120
Good, best of luck.

1630
03:23:58,120 --> 03:24:04,120
Please, please promise me you'll make everyone's dream come true once again.

1631
03:24:04,120 --> 03:24:07,120
Yeah, yeah.

1632
03:24:14,120 --> 03:24:16,120
Say what?

1633
03:24:28,120 --> 03:24:30,120
Wrong way again.

1634
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:34,120
You're acting like I didn't want to see this animation.

1635
03:24:50,120 --> 03:24:53,120
I like the way he holds his hat going...

1636
03:24:53,120 --> 03:24:56,120
Wahoo!

1637
03:24:59,120 --> 03:25:02,120
The bus has finally been repaired.

1638
03:25:02,120 --> 03:25:05,120
We can start operating again.

1639
03:25:05,120 --> 03:25:07,120
Prince Malo!

1640
03:25:07,120 --> 03:25:09,120
Why don't you go to Bowser's Keep?

1641
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:11,120
Can you give us a lift, please?

1642
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:13,120
I heard the story from King Nimbus.

1643
03:25:13,120 --> 03:25:15,120
You'll be there in no time.

1644
03:25:17,120 --> 03:25:19,120
Here it comes! Here it comes!

1645
03:25:29,120 --> 03:25:32,120
It looks like a taxi!

1646
03:25:32,120 --> 03:25:34,120
Look at Uber!

1647
03:25:34,120 --> 03:25:36,120
So how's the engine running?

1648
03:25:36,120 --> 03:25:39,120
Oh, it's purring like a kitten.

1649
03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:43,120
Do you take Prince Malo to the entrance of Bowser's Keep?

1650
03:25:43,120 --> 03:25:47,120
Of course! Can't wait to get this thing running again!

1651
03:25:47,120 --> 03:25:49,120
Come on, Prince! Hop on board!

1652
03:25:59,120 --> 03:26:01,120
All aboard!

1653
03:26:01,120 --> 03:26:03,120
We're off!

1654
03:26:03,120 --> 03:26:05,120
It just looks like a...

1655
03:26:05,120 --> 03:26:07,120
It doesn't look like a bus!

1656
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:09,120
It looks like a...

1657
03:26:09,120 --> 03:26:11,120
Like a taxi...

1658
03:26:11,120 --> 03:26:13,120
Or a shuttle.

1659
03:26:29,120 --> 03:26:31,120
Ah!

1660
03:26:31,120 --> 03:26:33,120
The center-boiling lava.

1661
03:26:33,120 --> 03:26:35,120
It's so nice to be home.

1662
03:26:35,120 --> 03:26:38,120
Smithy's gonna pay for stealing my flooded castle for me!

1663
03:26:41,120 --> 03:26:43,120
Can I... Can I go back, though?

1664
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:45,120
Can I start gambling?

1665
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:49,120
Can I start gambling?

1666
03:26:58,120 --> 03:27:00,120
Can I go back?

1667
03:27:17,120 --> 03:27:19,120
Step-pie!

1668
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:23,120
Oops. That's how she's metal.

1669
03:27:23,120 --> 03:27:26,120
Oh, thank you, you know, she probably can get the metal plate in Mobile now.

1670
03:27:26,120 --> 03:27:28,120
Oh, I already did!

1671
03:27:29,120 --> 03:27:31,120
There's Bean Valley.

1672
03:27:32,120 --> 03:27:34,120
Hold on, I got so confused.

1673
03:27:56,120 --> 03:27:58,120
Eh, what a...

1674
03:27:58,120 --> 03:28:00,120
Wait, I did? I passed it?

1675
03:28:02,120 --> 03:28:04,120
Oh, right here!

1676
03:28:04,120 --> 03:28:06,120
Wow, I'm dumb.

1677
03:28:06,120 --> 03:28:08,120
Where is it?

1678
03:28:14,120 --> 03:28:16,120
And I exited.

1679
03:28:20,120 --> 03:28:22,120
Wait, where is it?

1680
03:28:22,120 --> 03:28:24,120
Ow.

1681
03:28:24,120 --> 03:28:26,120
Ow.

1682
03:28:55,120 --> 03:28:57,120
This way?

1683
03:29:04,120 --> 03:29:06,120
This way?

1684
03:29:10,120 --> 03:29:12,120
No.

1685
03:29:12,120 --> 03:29:14,120
Ah.

1686
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:25,120
I still got poison anyway!

1687
03:29:25,120 --> 03:29:27,120
Rude.

1688
03:29:42,120 --> 03:29:44,120
Oh, I don't need to save.

1689
03:29:44,120 --> 03:29:46,120
I don't think...

1690
03:30:12,120 --> 03:30:14,120
Wait, what?

1691
03:30:22,120 --> 03:30:24,120
Wait, what?

1692
03:30:28,120 --> 03:30:30,120
I might be good to save just in case.

1693
03:30:30,120 --> 03:30:32,120
Okay.

1694
03:30:36,120 --> 03:30:38,120
The one of these?

1695
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:41,120
This one?

1696
03:30:48,120 --> 03:30:50,120
Wow.

1697
03:31:09,120 --> 03:31:11,120
Oh!

1698
03:31:26,120 --> 03:31:28,120
Oh, Peach!

1699
03:31:30,120 --> 03:31:32,120
No magic for Peach.

1700
03:31:39,120 --> 03:31:41,120
Here?

1701
03:31:53,120 --> 03:31:55,120
That doesn't seem right.

1702
03:32:08,120 --> 03:32:10,120
Oh.

1703
03:32:25,120 --> 03:32:27,120
Oh, okay, that was some heavy hitting.

1704
03:32:32,120 --> 03:32:34,120
Hello?

1705
03:32:35,120 --> 03:32:37,120
Oh?

1706
03:32:58,120 --> 03:33:00,120
Casino!

1707
03:33:00,120 --> 03:33:02,120
Please enjoy yourself.

1708
03:33:04,120 --> 03:33:06,120
You're not allowed to get it?

1709
03:33:06,120 --> 03:33:08,120
Welcome to Great Guy's Casino.

1710
03:33:08,120 --> 03:33:10,120
Want to play the prize blocks?

1711
03:33:10,120 --> 03:33:12,120
No? Not yet.

1712
03:33:12,120 --> 03:33:14,120
As you wish.

1713
03:33:16,120 --> 03:33:18,120
Hello, Mario!

1714
03:33:18,120 --> 03:33:20,120
I'm here in this casino.

1715
03:33:20,120 --> 03:33:22,120
Feel free to enjoy yourself.

1716
03:33:26,120 --> 03:33:28,120
Welcome to the memory table.

1717
03:33:28,120 --> 03:33:30,120
Play a game with me.

1718
03:33:30,120 --> 03:33:32,120
As you wish, like this.

1719
03:33:35,120 --> 03:33:37,120
Hit it once to start the game.

1720
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:40,120
Each consecutive hit will freeze on one of the pictures.

1721
03:33:40,120 --> 03:33:42,120
Match up three and you'll win the prize.

1722
03:33:42,120 --> 03:33:44,120
Want to try it out? Yeah.

1723
03:33:44,120 --> 03:33:46,120
Does it cost money?

1724
03:33:52,120 --> 03:33:54,120
Shit.

1725
03:33:56,120 --> 03:33:58,120
Are the games, sir?

1726
03:33:58,120 --> 03:34:00,120
No?

1727
03:34:05,120 --> 03:34:08,120
I wonder what became a booster search for a bride.

1728
03:34:10,120 --> 03:34:12,120
This is so slow.

1729
03:34:12,120 --> 03:34:14,120
Hey Mario, want to play a look the other way with me?

1730
03:34:14,120 --> 03:34:16,120
At the end, look the other...

1731
03:34:16,120 --> 03:34:18,120
Wait!

1732
03:34:18,120 --> 03:34:20,120
Oh, you didn't get caught. I lost this round.

1733
03:34:20,120 --> 03:34:22,120
Here, you can have this.

1734
03:34:22,120 --> 03:34:24,120
Oh, mushroom. Try it again.

1735
03:34:24,120 --> 03:34:26,120
No? Wait, is it just free?

1736
03:34:28,120 --> 03:34:30,120
You think you're so hot, but you're not.

1737
03:34:34,120 --> 03:34:36,120
Really?

1738
03:34:59,120 --> 03:35:01,120
Yeah, sure.

1739
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:07,120
Okay.

1740
03:35:07,120 --> 03:35:10,120
I will show you the cards that are in your position carefully.

1741
03:35:17,120 --> 03:35:19,120
Shit!

1742
03:35:19,120 --> 03:35:21,120
I am not good at memorizing.

1743
03:35:21,120 --> 03:35:23,120
Oh shit! I was so close!

1744
03:35:34,120 --> 03:35:36,120
Eels.

1745
03:35:39,120 --> 03:35:41,120
Eels.

1746
03:35:43,120 --> 03:35:45,120
That's correct.

1747
03:35:46,120 --> 03:35:48,120
Card is beaches.

1748
03:35:48,120 --> 03:35:50,120
That's correct.

1749
03:35:52,120 --> 03:35:54,120
Each card is Bowser's.

1750
03:35:57,120 --> 03:36:00,120
Like you won, Mario, please accept your prize.

1751
03:36:00,120 --> 03:36:02,120
Got a finless cola.

1752
03:36:04,120 --> 03:36:06,120
Yeah, I want to play again, sorry.

1753
03:36:12,120 --> 03:36:14,120
Okay.

1754
03:36:20,120 --> 03:36:22,120
Best beaches.

1755
03:36:25,120 --> 03:36:27,120
Bowser's here.

1756
03:36:31,120 --> 03:36:33,120
That one's Mario.

1757
03:36:34,120 --> 03:36:36,120
Yay!

1758
03:36:56,120 --> 03:36:58,120
Eno.

1759
03:36:58,120 --> 03:37:00,120
Mario.

1760
03:37:03,120 --> 03:37:05,120
Mario.

1761
03:37:10,120 --> 03:37:12,120
Mario.

1762
03:37:20,120 --> 03:37:24,120
Sorry, I love gambling, but not really gambling.

1763
03:37:24,120 --> 03:37:26,120
It's free gambling, therefore it's good.

1764
03:37:28,120 --> 03:37:30,120
Mario.

1765
03:37:37,120 --> 03:37:39,120
Peach.

1766
03:37:44,120 --> 03:37:46,120
Mario.

1767
03:37:49,120 --> 03:37:51,120
Hello?

1768
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:53,120
Yeah!

1769
03:37:59,120 --> 03:38:01,120
Okay, I'm good now.

1770
03:38:04,120 --> 03:38:06,120
What about this one?

1771
03:38:11,120 --> 03:38:14,120
Oh, right and left on L.

1772
03:38:24,120 --> 03:38:26,120
Yay!

1773
03:38:26,120 --> 03:38:28,120
My room.

1774
03:38:52,120 --> 03:38:54,120
What am I supposed to do?

1775
03:38:56,120 --> 03:38:58,120
Okay.

1776
03:39:15,120 --> 03:39:17,120
I just want to play it for free, man.

1777
03:39:20,120 --> 03:39:22,120
Man.

1778
03:39:27,120 --> 03:39:29,120
Fuck.

1779
03:39:38,120 --> 03:39:40,120
My life sucks.

1780
03:39:40,120 --> 03:39:43,120
I can't, I can't do this anymore.

1781
03:39:43,120 --> 03:39:45,120
Wah!

1782
03:39:56,120 --> 03:40:01,120
Do I get a special prize if I, like, win a lot?

1783
03:40:26,120 --> 03:40:29,120
I think he's stronger than these guys, maybe.

1784
03:40:33,120 --> 03:40:35,120
He's hoping for more money.

1785
03:40:36,120 --> 03:40:39,120
Aren't these guys Bowser's friends?

1786
03:40:49,120 --> 03:40:51,120
Oops.

1787
03:40:51,120 --> 03:40:54,120
Pro Goomba? Pro Goomba?

1788
03:40:56,120 --> 03:40:58,120
Yeah.

1789
03:41:01,120 --> 03:41:04,120
Bowser's scaring the Pro Goomba.

1790
03:41:14,120 --> 03:41:17,120
I forgot this is my meekness.

1791
03:41:26,120 --> 03:41:28,120
Okay.

1792
03:41:42,120 --> 03:41:44,120
At least I ran away.

1793
03:41:50,120 --> 03:41:52,120
He's just looking at him.

1794
03:41:53,120 --> 03:41:56,120
Bowser's scaring the Malacupas.

1795
03:41:57,120 --> 03:42:00,120
I'm so glad this is a thing.

1796
03:42:10,120 --> 03:42:13,120
He's just there, he's like...

1797
03:42:15,120 --> 03:42:17,120
It was fun.

1798
03:42:23,120 --> 03:42:25,120
Huh.

1799
03:42:26,120 --> 03:42:30,120
The Forky is enraptured, by what?

1800
03:42:35,120 --> 03:42:37,120
Shit.

1801
03:42:48,120 --> 03:42:51,120
Forky has come to his senses.

1802
03:42:52,120 --> 03:42:55,120
Forky, forky, forky.

1803
03:42:55,120 --> 03:42:57,120
Okay.

1804
03:43:18,120 --> 03:43:22,120
I need to, like, jump on it?

1805
03:43:25,120 --> 03:43:27,120
Okay.

1806
03:43:30,120 --> 03:43:32,120
And...

1807
03:43:48,120 --> 03:43:50,120
Is this gonna be good enough?

1808
03:43:55,120 --> 03:43:57,120
Okay.

1809
03:44:01,120 --> 03:44:05,120
Oh, well, good enough. And a Froggy coin.

1810
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:08,120
Okay.

1811
03:44:24,120 --> 03:44:27,120
Get out of here, I need Bowser.

1812
03:44:35,120 --> 03:44:37,120
Okay.

1813
03:44:54,120 --> 03:44:56,120
There we go.

1814
03:44:57,120 --> 03:44:59,120
Okay.

1815
03:45:02,120 --> 03:45:05,120
Where'd he go? He just died.

1816
03:45:05,120 --> 03:45:07,120
Did you see that one?

1817
03:45:16,120 --> 03:45:18,120
He's dumb too, he's doomed.

1818
03:45:18,120 --> 03:45:20,120
Imara, did you remember to use save point?

1819
03:45:20,120 --> 03:45:23,120
It's funny and dangerous ahead, so it's best to save now.

1820
03:45:23,120 --> 03:45:25,120
You need anything? Got some items to sell.

1821
03:45:25,120 --> 03:45:27,120
Wait, you're selling me stuff?

1822
03:45:40,120 --> 03:45:43,120
Wait, I already have all of these, right?

1823
03:45:45,120 --> 03:45:48,120
Oh, no, thanks. Thank you.

1824
03:45:51,120 --> 03:45:54,120
There are six doors, need an explanation? Yes.

1825
03:45:54,120 --> 03:45:56,120
Of the six doors.

1826
03:45:59,120 --> 03:46:02,120
Two open into action courses. Can you handle all that?

1827
03:46:02,120 --> 03:46:05,120
You can handle all the actions, right?

1828
03:46:07,120 --> 03:46:09,120
No!

1829
03:46:11,120 --> 03:46:14,120
Others will lead you to battle courses, you can fight, right?

1830
03:46:17,120 --> 03:46:19,120
The last two option, into puzzle courses.

1831
03:46:19,120 --> 03:46:20,120
You like to...

1832
03:46:20,120 --> 03:46:23,120
No sweat for great puzzle solvers like you, right?

1833
03:46:25,120 --> 03:46:28,120
Once you choose a course, there's no turning back.

1834
03:46:30,120 --> 03:46:33,120
The only way to know what's behind a door is to walk through it.

1835
03:46:33,120 --> 03:46:36,120
You must pass four of the six courses to move ahead.

1836
03:46:45,120 --> 03:46:48,120
Eh, I'm the quiz master, you can call me Dr. T.

1837
03:46:48,120 --> 03:46:50,120
You need to coin collecting, eh?

Instructions? Yes.

1839
03:46:53,120 --> 03:46:55,120
There are 21 coins in this box.

1840
03:46:55,120 --> 03:46:57,120
We'll take turns removing them.

1841
03:46:57,120 --> 03:46:59,120
The one who takes the last coin is a loser.

1842
03:46:59,120 --> 03:47:01,120
Grab four at once.

1843
03:47:01,120 --> 03:47:04,120
If you want to grab only one or two, press A.

1844
03:47:04,120 --> 03:47:06,120
Or you want to stop, okay?

1845
03:47:22,120 --> 03:47:25,120
I actually don't know how to play this.

1846
03:47:32,120 --> 03:47:34,120
Where are we?

1847
03:47:53,120 --> 03:47:56,120
Yeah, you got the last coin you lose.

1848
03:47:56,120 --> 03:47:58,120

1849
03:48:00,120 --> 03:48:02,120
Wait, I did?

1850
03:48:05,120 --> 03:48:07,120

1851
03:48:07,120 --> 03:48:08,120
Oh.

1852
03:48:09,120 --> 03:48:11,120
Alright, that was my bad.

1853
03:48:11,120 --> 03:48:14,120
Hey, hey, it's me, the quiz master, and it's quiz time!

1854
03:48:14,120 --> 03:48:16,120
Need an explanation? Yeah.

03:48:16,120 --> 03:48:18,120

1856
03:48:18,120 --> 03:48:20,120
Count them, 12 questions.

1857
03:48:20,120 --> 03:48:22,120
You're right, the block you're standing on will move up,

1858
03:48:22,120 --> 03:48:24,120
but if you blow it, you go two down.

1859
03:48:24,120 --> 03:48:26,120
Five seconds if you can't answer, you move down one.

1860
03:48:26,120 --> 03:48:28,120
Reach the A step within the 12-plus,

1861
03:48:28,120 --> 03:48:30,120
and then you won, got it?

1862
03:48:30,120 --> 03:48:34,120

2010
04:06:41,400 --> 04:06:44,360
Okay, and below for everything else

2011
04:06:54,680 --> 04:07:00,440
Okay goo got the same in swimming and cycling

2012
04:07:05,080 --> 04:07:10,280
Beep bo bo beet bones on bike and final

2013
04:07:12,920 --> 04:07:14,920
So bones definitely got fourth

2014
04:07:16,520 --> 04:07:22,440
Okay, so bones was fourth. Okay, let's do god damn. I don't have no notes for this

2015
04:07:25,080 --> 04:07:29,400
Okay, so in biking

2016
04:07:34,360 --> 04:07:41,000
Bones there are four of them

2017
04:07:43,640 --> 04:07:50,600
Okay, so one two three four, so bones got fourth

2018
04:07:57,080 --> 04:08:00,200
So that means bones is fourth

2019
04:08:00,280 --> 04:08:08,440
Kip is third because kip never got better in anything past that

2020
04:08:11,080 --> 04:08:14,840
Boo beep bones on bike and the final

2021
04:08:17,000 --> 04:08:19,960
And goo was the same in

2022
04:08:22,280 --> 04:08:24,280
Swimming and cycling

2023
04:08:25,480 --> 04:08:28,120
So I'm gonna guess two is boo

2024
04:08:30,200 --> 04:08:32,200
So

2025
04:08:42,840 --> 04:08:48,440
Can I talk to the goomba goomba says they got the same in swimming and cycling

2026
04:08:48,440 --> 04:08:50,440
I

2027
04:08:58,280 --> 04:09:00,280
Can do it again

2028
04:09:03,800 --> 04:09:05,800
See I place this

2029
04:09:07,640 --> 04:09:11,160
Same in swimming and cycling and two others beat me in the marathon

2030
04:09:19,000 --> 04:09:24,840
I out did bones on my bike and the final rankings

2031
04:09:30,200 --> 04:09:33,560
Merit remember the marathon is the last event, okay

2032
04:09:41,080 --> 04:09:45,480
Okay, so boo could possibly I mean goo could have been the first

2033
04:09:49,400 --> 04:09:51,400
I

2034
04:09:58,440 --> 04:10:00,440
And boo

2035
04:10:02,760 --> 04:10:06,440
Definitely beat kippin bones

2036
04:10:18,760 --> 04:10:20,760
So

2037
04:10:26,280 --> 04:10:31,320
So kip said came in third for swimming and never did better in the any events so

2038
04:10:34,920 --> 04:10:36,920
Third is swimming and there's only one

2039
04:10:36,920 --> 04:10:49,320
So said bones says fourth so that's last place

2040
04:10:50,280 --> 04:10:52,280
Ah

2041
04:11:04,520 --> 04:11:09,800
This is that does that mean kip could have gotten higher in cycling no maybe

2042
04:11:14,680 --> 04:11:18,200
What was the what was the uh, sorry, what was the order of things?

2043
04:11:20,040 --> 04:11:22,040
Swimming

2044
04:11:26,840 --> 04:11:33,480
No, it was swimming cycling marathon, so if you came third for swimming, that's the first event

2045
04:11:34,200 --> 04:11:36,200
So

2046
04:11:48,440 --> 04:11:50,760
Kip says he didn't do better in the events after swimming

2047
04:11:51,400 --> 04:11:54,680
Yeah, swimming's the first event, so he never did anything better than that

2048
04:11:54,920 --> 04:11:57,640
So if we're going I'm going by biking first because we know

2049
04:11:58,680 --> 04:12:00,200
that

2050
04:12:00,200 --> 04:12:01,400
um

2051
04:12:01,480 --> 04:12:03,480
Bones here look bones says

2052
04:12:05,080 --> 04:12:07,880
Was fourth place in the bike race so bones

2053
04:12:10,120 --> 04:12:12,120
Is definitely number four

2054
04:12:14,520 --> 04:12:20,360
Kip said never did better better than third place so kip is the next one

2055
04:12:21,720 --> 04:12:25,160
Now we don't know about boo and goo

2056
04:12:25,960 --> 04:12:27,960
So goo said I found the same

2057
04:12:29,480 --> 04:12:34,120
Swimming and cycling events, but the other two beat me in the marathon

2058
04:12:36,280 --> 04:12:38,280
And

2059
04:12:38,280 --> 04:12:42,920
Boo said I doubted bones, so it's it's a throw up between who did better

2060
04:12:43,560 --> 04:12:47,480
Uh goo or boo in the biking event. So now the swimming event

2061
04:12:50,280 --> 04:12:53,000
One two three four

2062
04:12:53,720 --> 04:12:55,720
Two three four we know kip

2063
04:12:57,240 --> 04:12:59,000
did

2064
04:12:59,000 --> 04:13:00,200
third

2065
04:13:00,200 --> 04:13:02,200
again

2066
04:13:02,840 --> 04:13:04,840
In the swimming

2067
04:13:13,720 --> 04:13:15,720
And then hold on marathon

2068
04:13:19,560 --> 04:13:21,560
One two three four

2069
04:13:23,880 --> 04:13:25,880
So two people

2070
04:13:28,120 --> 04:13:30,120
Beat

2071
04:13:30,120 --> 04:13:32,120
goo in marathon

2072
04:13:33,000 --> 04:13:36,600
So that means goo was in third for marathon

2073
04:13:38,040 --> 04:13:40,040
And that means

2074
04:13:40,120 --> 04:13:42,120
Kip

2075
04:13:42,120 --> 04:13:44,120
Was last in marathon

2076
04:13:44,120 --> 04:13:55,000
So boo did better than bones

2077
04:13:59,800 --> 04:14:04,600
Okay, I did the same place as I ended up in this swimming event

2078
04:14:04,760 --> 04:14:06,760
So

2079
04:14:11,160 --> 04:14:13,880
Bones would be one or two for the swimming event

2080
04:14:17,560 --> 04:14:19,560
So that means

2081
04:14:26,200 --> 04:14:28,200
I outdid that

2082
04:14:29,400 --> 04:14:31,400
I

2083
04:14:31,560 --> 04:14:33,560
I

2084
04:14:33,880 --> 04:14:35,880
That means boo

2085
04:14:38,440 --> 04:14:44,120
Boo probably won goo is in second place for biking. Sorry got it boo

2086
04:14:46,600 --> 04:14:49,640
Then goo then kip them bones for biking

2087
04:15:01,720 --> 04:15:09,000
And I'm in the same place as I did in this swimming event

2088
04:15:16,360 --> 04:15:20,520
Place the same in swimming and cycling so that means goo

2089
04:15:23,480 --> 04:15:27,560
If cycling that means swimming goo would have been in second place

2090
04:15:32,360 --> 04:15:34,360
So

2091
04:15:39,960 --> 04:15:43,160
Two others beat me in the marathon that means you were third place

2092
04:15:56,120 --> 04:15:58,120
Need to figure out our bones was

2093
04:15:59,080 --> 04:16:02,360
And kip says I'd never did better than third

2094
04:16:07,400 --> 04:16:09,400
I need swimming

2095
04:16:16,680 --> 04:16:18,680
Boo was last then

2096
04:16:28,120 --> 04:16:30,120
So

2097
04:16:58,120 --> 04:17:00,120
So

2098
04:17:17,560 --> 04:17:26,200
Or I'm trying to figure out the swimming so kip did third I think goo would have gone second then

2099
04:17:28,840 --> 04:17:30,840
Since I think

2100
04:17:32,200 --> 04:17:36,280
Boo beat bones on the bike

2101
04:17:49,400 --> 04:17:51,400
Swimming and cycling

2102
04:17:58,360 --> 04:18:00,360
I

2103
04:18:08,520 --> 04:18:12,680
But goo said I ended up in the third place. Sorry, I'm confusing myself

2104
04:18:16,200 --> 04:18:18,200
Okay, hold on I

2105
04:18:18,840 --> 04:18:27,240
Do is third

2106
04:18:36,440 --> 04:18:39,240
I place the same in swimming and cycling events

2107
04:18:49,160 --> 04:18:52,920
But the other two beat me in marathon

2108
04:18:54,920 --> 04:18:59,400
Sorry, I need bones I fell into fourth place during the bike

2109
04:19:01,480 --> 04:19:06,200
But finally ended up in the same place as I did the swimming

2110
04:19:18,200 --> 04:19:20,200
So

2111
04:19:48,200 --> 04:19:50,200
So

2112
04:20:01,640 --> 04:20:03,640
I'm confusing myself

2113
04:20:15,000 --> 04:20:17,000
Oh

2114
04:20:18,200 --> 04:20:20,200
So

2115
04:20:48,360 --> 04:20:50,360
So

2116
04:21:03,720 --> 04:21:10,920
Wait the final ranking and the wait wait wait hold on the final ranking

2117
04:21:15,160 --> 04:21:17,160
Is not the same as the marathon

2118
04:21:18,280 --> 04:21:20,280
So

2119
04:21:31,160 --> 04:21:35,400
No, it is the same as the marathon so the final ranking is the marathon

2120
04:21:42,760 --> 04:21:45,400
The winners of the marathon are the winners overall

2121
04:21:48,600 --> 04:21:53,480
Wait the marathon is final though, doesn't that mean it's the final

2122
04:21:56,360 --> 04:21:58,360
Semantics here is so hard

2123
04:22:09,000 --> 04:22:11,000
I don't know anything about splits

2124
04:22:19,000 --> 04:22:21,000
So

2125
04:22:23,960 --> 04:22:25,960
Hold on give me a second

2126
04:22:32,200 --> 04:22:38,840
I gotta do this again I'm getting confused I I'm overthinking

2127
04:22:48,680 --> 04:22:50,680
I

2128
04:22:51,240 --> 04:22:55,320
Don't know what the final versus the marathon is that's the issue right now

2129
04:22:55,560 --> 04:22:57,560
I thought there was only three

2130
04:22:57,640 --> 04:23:02,680
But if there's like a final ranking where where like you put odd things together that makes things different

2131
04:23:18,520 --> 04:23:29,960
I'm overthinking that's my weakness

2132
04:23:39,080 --> 04:23:41,080
You came third in swimming

2133
04:23:41,240 --> 04:23:47,720
So this means this is kip

2134
04:23:51,400 --> 04:23:54,040
And kip's always either third or fourth

2135
04:23:58,680 --> 04:24:00,680
Goom says

2136
04:24:01,800 --> 04:24:04,360
Two others beat me in the marathon so that means

2137
04:24:06,520 --> 04:24:08,520
Goo was third

2138
04:24:11,080 --> 04:24:18,200
And bone says fourth place in the bike race so we know

2139
04:24:21,320 --> 04:24:23,800
Bones if bones is fourth fourth is the last place

2140
04:24:24,520 --> 04:24:28,520
So that means kip ever did better than three so we know kip

2141
04:24:29,240 --> 04:24:33,160
Is third in that so for the bike

2142
04:24:37,480 --> 04:24:40,440
Bike race we know exactly where kip and bones are

2143
04:24:41,080 --> 04:24:43,080
So

2144
04:25:11,800 --> 04:25:13,800
So

2145
04:25:22,360 --> 04:25:24,360
If goo and then we know

2146
04:25:25,240 --> 04:25:30,280
Goo was third that means kip was last bottom tier in marathon

2147
04:25:32,120 --> 04:25:36,600
That's all we know so far. So these are the guaranteed ones

2148
04:25:37,560 --> 04:25:39,560
Now we don't know if

2149
04:25:40,520 --> 04:25:46,840
Goo or boo got in first or second

2150
04:25:51,720 --> 04:25:59,720
But we do know that goo placed the same in swimming and cycling

2151
04:26:09,560 --> 04:26:19,720
So they're the same in the cycling so it's either first or second first or second for goo

2152
04:26:39,560 --> 04:26:54,600
Bone says I fell in the fourth place during the bike race, but finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event

2153
04:26:56,360 --> 04:27:00,280
So that means boo has to be above

2154
04:27:01,960 --> 04:27:03,960
Above

2155
04:27:06,440 --> 04:27:08,440
The bones

2156
04:27:09,560 --> 04:27:11,560
So

2157
04:27:11,800 --> 04:27:13,800
So

2158
04:27:35,800 --> 04:27:40,440
Wait I placed the same in swimming and cycling events, but the other two beat me in the marathon

2159
04:27:42,280 --> 04:27:47,800
Okay, who's almost the same

2160
04:28:06,360 --> 04:28:09,480
Swimming and cycling goo was either first or second

2161
04:28:11,880 --> 04:28:13,880
Goo

2162
04:28:18,280 --> 04:28:23,000
Wasn't third. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah goo was in third because others to beat him. So we know the guaranteed so far

2163
04:28:23,880 --> 04:28:27,240
bike is one two either goo or boo

2164
04:28:28,680 --> 04:28:30,680
Old bike kip

2165
04:28:30,760 --> 04:28:32,440
bones

2166
04:28:32,440 --> 04:28:39,960
Because bone said they were in fourth, but kip never did better than third. So kip goes on top

2167
04:28:41,800 --> 04:28:43,400
kip also

2168
04:28:43,400 --> 04:28:44,760
was

2169
04:28:44,760 --> 04:28:48,440
Is fourth in the marathon and third in the uh

2170
04:28:49,160 --> 04:28:54,120
Swimming because that's where they said it is so we know all the locations of kip. We don't need

2171
04:28:55,000 --> 04:28:57,000
kip's fucking opinion anymore

2172
04:29:03,880 --> 04:29:09,160
We don't need kip's fucking opinion anymore. It's the other three we're having problems with we place kip

2173
04:29:10,120 --> 04:29:12,120
Everywhere already

2174
04:29:25,400 --> 04:29:29,400
So all we know is that bones even though was in fourth

2175
04:29:32,600 --> 04:29:34,600
Had to be in either

2176
04:29:34,840 --> 04:29:36,840
Second

2177
04:29:40,680 --> 04:29:42,680
So if

2178
04:29:43,240 --> 04:29:45,240
Second or third

2179
04:29:49,880 --> 04:29:52,920
No second no second or first but if

2180
04:29:55,080 --> 04:29:57,080
Hold on

2181
04:29:57,800 --> 04:30:08,840
Swimming swimming and the marathon were the same. I mean bones was

2182
04:30:14,760 --> 04:30:19,560
Yeah, bones is is second for both of them

2183
04:30:27,240 --> 04:30:36,600
Swimming and cycling

2184
04:30:52,760 --> 04:30:55,240
Boo got first in marathon then

2185
04:30:57,080 --> 04:31:09,640
Swimming and cycling what two others beat me in the marathon

2186
04:31:14,440 --> 04:31:16,440
Goo is first

2187
04:31:18,920 --> 04:31:20,920
In bike

2188
04:31:27,560 --> 04:31:31,080
And swimming I think that's the only place I can think of

2189
04:31:35,880 --> 04:31:37,880
Boo came in first in the marathon

2190
04:31:37,880 --> 04:31:39,880
So

2191
04:31:53,160 --> 04:31:55,880
On the fourth but ended up in the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah

2192
04:32:04,680 --> 04:32:06,680
I think I got it

2193
04:32:08,120 --> 04:32:10,120
I

2194
04:32:11,880 --> 04:32:13,880
Got it

2195
04:32:15,000 --> 04:32:17,160
Since this is the only places that they can

2196
04:32:20,680 --> 04:32:23,000
They can place I think

2197
04:32:38,200 --> 04:32:40,200
Okay, I think I got it

2198
04:32:41,640 --> 04:32:45,320
I think I got it if I'm wrong that was me

2199
04:32:47,320 --> 04:32:49,320
Maybe

2200
04:33:08,840 --> 04:33:10,840
Wait

2201
04:33:20,440 --> 04:33:22,440
The order that they came in

2202
04:33:24,360 --> 04:33:33,160
Wait wait for what event or what event go talk to the one the first one in the final what event

2203
04:33:34,040 --> 04:33:42,040
The the whole event the marathon, okay, that means boo went first. Yes

2204
04:33:44,280 --> 04:33:46,280
Uh bones came in second

2205
04:33:50,840 --> 04:33:52,840
Goo came in third

2206
04:33:55,640 --> 04:33:57,640
And kip came in last

2207
04:34:04,040 --> 04:34:11,560
I'm not actually sure

2208
04:34:25,080 --> 04:34:29,320
Yeah, I did it I'm so smart but stupid at the same time

2209
04:34:33,480 --> 04:34:35,480
What's this rock candy?

2210
04:34:51,720 --> 04:34:57,480
I got everyone in there their places because I was like, okay, this is the only places they can go after a while

2211
04:34:57,480 --> 04:34:59,480
Oh

04:35:00,360 --> 04:35:02,360

2216
04:35:42,840 --> 04:35:45,720
I feel a little insulted. It's just the battle room

2217
04:35:57,480 --> 04:35:59,960
Oh, I didn't have to battle at all

2218
04:36:27,480 --> 04:36:29,480
So

2219
04:36:51,400 --> 04:36:54,600
Oh god damn it. I don't actually know what

2220
04:36:57,480 --> 04:37:00,440
It's strong against them

2221
04:37:28,360 --> 04:37:30,360
Oh

2222
04:37:30,360 --> 04:37:32,360
I

2223
04:38:00,360 --> 04:38:02,360
I

2224
04:38:09,800 --> 04:38:11,800

2228
04:38:36,680 --> 04:38:42,680
Solved it so I know it took a while, but I was like shit. I have to confirm

2229
04:38:46,200 --> 04:38:48,280
I I already got out the pen and paper. Yeah

2230
04:38:48,280 --> 04:38:50,280

Not complaining that I took long if you didn't even do it

2232
04:39:10,120 --> 04:39:14,280
That's my only thing is that don't no complain if I took too long if you didn't even do it

It's like it's like those

2236
04:39:41,000 --> 04:39:46,280
It's one of my pet peeves where someone's like I could do this better than you and I'm like why aren't you then

2237
04:39:46,280 --> 04:39:50,680
But I don't think you meant it that way so I'll forgive you

2238
04:40:16,680 --> 04:40:18,680
Oh

2239
04:40:20,280 --> 04:40:22,280
There you go, they all died

2240
04:40:30,600 --> 04:40:35,240

Wait, wait, how many are these there's too many

2263
04:44:56,440 --> 04:44:58,440

Whoa

2268
04:45:33,800 --> 04:45:38,440
I don't want to do all the stages at once. I hope there's like a save point soon

2269
04:45:43,880 --> 04:45:45,880
I'm getting tired

2270
04:46:03,560 --> 04:46:07,880

04:47:12,440 --> 04:47:14,440
Am not lying to you

2278
04:47:16,600 --> 04:47:18,600
When is this thing gonna fucking die?

2279
04:47:32,840 --> 04:47:34,840

2280
04:47:49,400 --> 04:47:54,120
Was taken forever, you know who everyone leveled up

2281
04:48:03,000 --> 04:48:05,000

04:48:14,440 --> 04:48:16,440

04:48:20,040 --> 04:48:22,280

2284
04:48:26,440 --> 04:48:28,440
What

2285
04:48:28,920 --> 04:48:34,120
Oh, that's a really good weapon. Okay, let's go

2286
04:48:38,280 --> 04:48:44,360
I'm so tired another this thing maybe

2287
04:48:51,320 --> 04:48:53,640
You take me for a fool I'm not good at this

2288
04:48:58,440 --> 04:49:00,440
I

2289
04:49:00,440 --> 04:49:02,440
Do

2290
04:49:25,000 --> 04:49:27,000
Yeah, you went nothing to do it to it, huh

2291
04:49:31,240 --> 04:49:36,680
The fuck is this topic you ask the magic buttons

2292
04:49:39,240 --> 04:49:41,240
My instructions yes, please

2293
04:49:41,640 --> 04:49:44,680
Yes, step on one button and you reverse the surrounding buttons

2294
04:49:45,400 --> 04:49:48,120
So on becomes off and off becomes on get it

2295
04:49:48,840 --> 04:49:52,520
If you can set them all on the on can you do that? I don't know

2296
04:50:01,240 --> 04:50:05,560
Oh man, that was my bed

2297
04:50:12,120 --> 04:50:14,120
I can't do this anymore man

2298
04:50:18,920 --> 04:50:20,920
I fucked up already

2299
04:50:23,240 --> 04:50:25,480
Hold on let me just go into my corner

2300
04:50:31,320 --> 04:50:39,640
Am I doing I'm my brain fry is gone

2301
04:50:46,360 --> 04:50:48,360
I reset

2302
04:51:00,440 --> 04:51:04,520
I'm so stupid right now

2303
04:51:30,520 --> 04:51:45,480
There we go, we're good. Sorry, I'm good right now. There's this

2304
04:51:46,600 --> 04:51:49,560
Now the topic is ball solitaire. I hate solitaire

2305
04:51:50,280 --> 04:51:52,280
instructions, yeah

2306
04:51:52,520 --> 04:51:56,280
You kick a ball it'll leapfrog an adjacent ball which will then disappear

2307
04:51:56,360 --> 04:52:01,000
So keep making balls disappear until one remains you can't kick a ball into a space occupied by another ball

2308
04:52:01,640 --> 04:52:04,280
And the ball you kick must always leapfrog another ball got it

2309
04:52:07,320 --> 04:52:09,320
What

2310
04:52:10,040 --> 04:52:13,000
What was the instructions I'm sorry what?

2311
04:52:20,440 --> 04:52:22,440
Wait, how do I do that?

2312
04:52:27,240 --> 04:52:29,400
Do I jump over the balls myself wait

2313
04:52:36,200 --> 04:52:38,920
I'm sorry, I'm confused, but how do I leapfrog them?

2314
04:52:42,120 --> 04:52:44,120
How do I kick them

2315
04:52:47,560 --> 04:52:49,560
How do I kick them

2316
04:52:50,040 --> 04:52:52,040

So

2320
04:53:22,440 --> 04:53:24,440
Oh

2321
04:53:48,200 --> 04:53:50,200
It's wrong

2322
04:53:52,600 --> 04:53:54,600
Wait, I have to do it all over again. Shit

2323
04:53:58,040 --> 04:54:00,040
I didn't realize

2324
04:54:22,040 --> 04:54:24,040
I

2325
04:54:34,440 --> 04:54:38,120
Wait, did I fuck up? Yeah, I got the last coin fuck

2326
04:54:52,040 --> 04:54:54,040
Oh

2327
04:55:22,840 --> 04:55:24,840
Oh

2328
04:55:27,720 --> 04:55:30,600
Wait, I miscounted fuck I miscounted

2329
04:55:33,640 --> 04:55:35,640
Sorry, I miscounted

2330
04:55:36,840 --> 04:55:38,840
I'm so tired

2331
04:55:39,800 --> 04:55:41,800
Maybe I should do this later

2332
04:55:52,040 --> 04:55:54,040
Oh

2333
04:55:54,040 --> 04:55:56,040
Oh

2334
04:56:18,520 --> 04:56:20,520
Wait

2335
04:56:25,000 --> 04:56:27,400
You got it. Oh, you just let me win, huh?

2336
04:56:36,120 --> 04:56:38,120
That's when I was very brain empty

2337
04:56:38,120 --> 04:56:40,120
Oh

2338
04:56:51,640 --> 04:56:54,440
Oh, no, I was so brain empty for this one

2339
04:56:58,040 --> 04:57:00,040
I'm still brain empty

2340
04:57:08,280 --> 04:57:10,280
I

2341
04:57:13,160 --> 04:57:15,160
Let's brain empty

2342
04:57:29,880 --> 04:57:33,160
Okay, this one

2343
04:57:38,120 --> 04:57:40,120
Oh

2344
04:57:52,200 --> 04:57:54,200
Can I kick diagonally

2345
04:57:54,360 --> 04:57:56,360
Oh

2346
04:58:06,200 --> 04:58:08,200
Just one direction

2347
04:58:11,480 --> 04:58:13,480
Well, I think I already fucked up

2348
04:58:24,200 --> 04:58:26,200
Oh

2349
04:58:54,440 --> 04:58:56,440
I

2350
04:59:04,680 --> 04:59:08,600
I'm gonna get kicked out again. I don't think I can recover

2351
04:59:11,000 --> 04:59:14,440
If I kick if I kick this one

2352
04:59:18,280 --> 04:59:20,280
Backwards

2353
04:59:24,360 --> 04:59:26,360
I

2354
04:59:38,600 --> 04:59:46,600
Do this one where I can go like this and if it's here then I can't then no one else is here to get it

2355
04:59:46,600 --> 04:59:56,280
Because then it goes over here this one disappears it's here

2356
04:59:58,600 --> 05:00:01,320
Then it's all alone, right

2357
05:00:17,560 --> 05:00:19,560
I

2358
05:00:21,320 --> 05:00:23,320
Leftmost one

2359
05:00:26,440 --> 05:00:28,440
This one

2360
05:00:33,400 --> 05:00:35,400
Okay

2361
05:00:36,840 --> 05:00:38,840
I'm so bad at this

2362
05:00:46,840 --> 05:00:48,840
I like to kick this thank you

2363
05:01:12,920 --> 05:01:14,920
This one

2364
05:01:16,680 --> 05:01:18,680
This one right

2365
05:01:24,360 --> 05:01:26,360
Oops

2366
05:01:28,200 --> 05:01:30,200
Kick this one

2367
05:01:31,640 --> 05:01:33,640
And if I bounce

2368
05:01:38,520 --> 05:01:42,600
This one that's okay, right

2369
05:01:46,920 --> 05:01:53,560
I send this one over and I'll land here

2370
05:01:57,320 --> 05:02:03,800
Then this one can bounce over it wait now wait what?

2371
05:02:08,120 --> 05:02:10,120
It's recoverable

2372
05:02:10,200 --> 05:02:12,200
I

2373
05:02:16,280 --> 05:02:18,280
Wait hold on

2374
05:02:22,120 --> 05:02:24,680
I can also send this one over here

2375
05:02:27,000 --> 05:02:32,680
But then this one won't have anything this one will have to kick over here think

2376
05:02:37,080 --> 05:02:39,080
Wait this one

2377
05:02:40,200 --> 05:02:42,200
Can this one kick first

2378
05:02:48,600 --> 05:02:50,600
This one will have to go here

2379
05:02:54,200 --> 05:02:56,200
But then after that it's lost

2380
05:03:04,360 --> 05:03:06,360
I need to get rid of this one too

2381
05:03:07,000 --> 05:03:09,000
Oh no

2382
05:03:13,480 --> 05:03:15,480
Okay

2383
05:03:20,360 --> 05:03:24,200
You figured it out hold on this one

2384
05:03:26,440 --> 05:03:28,440
Have to kick into here

2385
05:03:29,560 --> 05:03:31,560
I'll land here

2386
05:03:31,880 --> 05:03:33,400
This one

2387
05:03:33,480 --> 05:03:42,040
There's two directions this this one I can go over here and make it disappear. Yeah

2388
05:03:51,400 --> 05:03:53,400
This one right

2389
05:04:04,200 --> 05:04:06,200
I think this one

2390
05:04:18,440 --> 05:04:21,160
And then me a second

2391
05:04:25,320 --> 05:04:27,320
This one goes

2392
05:04:30,760 --> 05:04:32,760
Here

2393
05:04:34,360 --> 05:04:41,320
But then it gets stuck here so that one can't move this one

2394
05:04:43,720 --> 05:04:45,720
Wait, but then I need this one too

2395
05:04:49,640 --> 05:04:52,360
This one to go here

2396
05:04:52,760 --> 05:05:03,080
Yeah, this one has to go here right this one has to go here

2397
05:05:10,120 --> 05:05:12,120
Right

2398
05:05:13,640 --> 05:05:15,640

Do I kick then this one goes over here hold on I'm giving

2400
05:05:28,680 --> 05:05:31,800

We kick this one right

2402
05:05:49,320 --> 05:05:51,320

05:07:09,160 --> 05:07:11,720
Rock candy or rock candy in storage

05:07:11,800 --> 05:07:26,760
I'm fucking screwed. Where is the save room?

2412
05:07:33,080 --> 05:07:35,080
I don't want an obstacle course

2413
05:07:35,080 --> 05:07:37,080
There's

2414
05:07:39,240 --> 05:07:41,240
A room doggle

2415
05:07:49,160 --> 05:07:54,120
Remember this one is oh no this one is an obstacle course

2416
05:07:56,760 --> 05:08:00,760
There is another battle path, which one is it?

2417
05:08:05,080 --> 05:08:07,080
Oh

2418
05:08:35,960 --> 05:08:37,960
I

2419
05:08:52,600 --> 05:08:54,600
Oh

05:09:05,880 --> 05:09:07,880

2421
05:09:24,280 --> 05:09:26,280
Big Koopa

2422
05:09:26,280 --> 05:09:28,280
I

2423
05:09:36,520 --> 05:09:38,520
I'm so sleepy

2424
05:09:46,840 --> 05:09:48,840
Holy fuck I'm tired

2425
05:09:57,240 --> 05:10:01,080
I'm so tired brain broken this part killed me

2426
05:10:04,040 --> 05:10:06,040
I want to cry

2427
05:10:26,360 --> 05:10:28,360
I

2428
05:10:41,240 --> 05:10:46,040
Want well, we'll beat this room and then I don't know man

2429
05:10:56,280 --> 05:10:58,280
I

2430
05:11:26,840 --> 05:11:28,840
I

2431
05:11:37,400 --> 05:11:39,400
Is right there

2432
05:11:57,240 --> 05:11:59,240
I

2433
05:12:03,640 --> 05:12:06,040
Don't want to do with this anymore just go

2434
05:12:15,000 --> 05:12:18,040
I spot the Yoshi like I spot my supplies

2435
05:12:27,080 --> 05:12:31,560
I think it's because I woke up early today again

2436
05:12:40,680 --> 05:12:45,080
Mr. Kipler, mr. Go on

2437
05:12:56,280 --> 05:12:58,280
I

2438
05:13:05,320 --> 05:13:12,120
Have a really bad feeling that if this boss that this boss is

2439
05:13:13,880 --> 05:13:15,880
The upcoming boss Smithy

2440
05:13:16,600 --> 05:13:22,840
Is gonna be really hard because I remember playing thousand year door and

2441
05:13:23,800 --> 05:13:25,960
The witch lady was like extremely hard

2442
05:13:30,680 --> 05:13:33,800
Which lady was extremely hard and

2443
05:13:43,320 --> 05:13:45,320
Yeah, and then I played

2444
05:13:46,040 --> 05:13:48,040
um

2445
05:13:48,920 --> 05:13:54,440
Super Mario brother superstar and that boss was really hard

2446
05:14:05,240 --> 05:14:11,320
So I have got a bad feeling this is gonna be really hard

2447
05:14:15,240 --> 05:14:17,240
A glum weeper

2448
05:14:18,040 --> 05:14:20,360
I

2449
05:14:48,040 --> 05:15:07,240
Oh fuck, I got it wrong this time.

2450
05:15:07,240 --> 05:15:09,840
Wow, that's amazing.

2451
05:15:09,840 --> 05:15:14,320
I got it wrong for once, I must be so tired.

2452
05:15:14,320 --> 05:15:16,320
I must be that tired, huh?

2453
05:15:44,320 --> 05:15:51,320
Oh fuck, I got it wrong this time, I must be so tired.

2454
05:16:15,320 --> 05:16:19,320
Oh my gosh, I've gone silent mode.

2455
05:16:19,320 --> 05:16:23,320
I've gone silent mode because all I want to do is make this be over.

2456
05:16:33,320 --> 05:16:35,320
We're almost there!

2457
05:16:35,320 --> 05:16:38,320
Gaming takes all the focus, I'm dead.

2458
05:16:44,320 --> 05:16:46,320
I'm dead.

2459
05:17:08,320 --> 05:17:11,320
We're... alright.

2460
05:17:14,320 --> 05:17:18,320
Oh my god, I feel like I'm being cheated right now.

2461
05:17:24,320 --> 05:17:26,320
I'm tired.

2462
05:17:27,320 --> 05:17:30,320
It's over, my Yoshi pal.

2463
05:17:31,320 --> 05:17:34,320
My Yoshi powers, it's over.

2464
05:17:36,320 --> 05:17:39,320
There's no exclamation marks anymore.

2465
05:17:45,320 --> 05:17:48,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2466
05:17:48,320 --> 05:17:50,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2467
05:17:50,320 --> 05:17:52,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2468
05:17:52,320 --> 05:17:54,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2469
05:17:54,320 --> 05:17:56,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2470
05:17:56,320 --> 05:17:58,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2471
05:17:58,320 --> 05:18:00,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2472
05:18:00,320 --> 05:18:02,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2473
05:18:02,320 --> 05:18:04,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2474
05:18:04,320 --> 05:18:06,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2475
05:18:06,320 --> 05:18:09,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2476
05:18:09,320 --> 05:18:12,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2477
05:18:12,320 --> 05:18:14,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2478
05:18:14,320 --> 05:18:16,320
We're almost there, my Yoshi pal.

2479
05:18:30,320 --> 05:18:33,320
Okay, I still got it.

2480
05:18:33,320 --> 05:18:35,320
I still got it.

2481
05:18:42,320 --> 05:18:45,320
A drill claw, what the hell is a drill claw?

2482
05:18:53,320 --> 05:18:55,320
Oh, okay.

2483
05:18:55,320 --> 05:18:57,320
Oh, some Baoziboo.

2484
05:19:02,320 --> 05:19:04,320
Finally, a save.

2485
05:19:13,320 --> 05:19:15,320
Actually, that's it.

2486
05:19:15,320 --> 05:19:17,320
We're saving here, period.

2487
05:19:17,320 --> 05:19:19,320
I'm gonna do it again.

2488
05:19:19,320 --> 05:19:21,320
Double tap and case high.

2489
05:19:25,320 --> 05:19:27,320
Case high, start crying.

2490
05:19:27,320 --> 05:19:29,320
It's freedom.

2491
05:19:29,320 --> 05:19:31,320
We can get some sleep now.

2492
05:19:31,320 --> 05:19:33,320
Like this.

2493
05:19:43,320 --> 05:19:47,320
A big,

2494
05:19:47,320 --> 05:19:51,320
a big, a big schedule time.

2495
05:19:51,320 --> 05:19:54,320
Guess what, sis?

2496
05:19:58,320 --> 05:20:00,320
Tomorrow,

2497
05:20:00,320 --> 05:20:02,320
it's more

2498
05:20:02,320 --> 05:20:04,320
wild arms.

2499
05:20:04,320 --> 05:20:06,320
Also get a chest working, woohoo.

2500
05:20:08,320 --> 05:20:11,320
It's more wild arms.

2501
05:20:12,320 --> 05:20:14,320
After that,

2502
05:20:14,320 --> 05:20:16,320
nothing.

2503
05:20:16,320 --> 05:20:20,320
Behold, I give you on Wednesday, nothing.

2504
05:20:20,320 --> 05:20:22,320
More shoot,

2505
05:20:22,320 --> 05:20:24,320
more wild arms,

2506
05:20:24,320 --> 05:20:26,320
more plot.

2507
05:20:26,320 --> 05:20:29,320
Hopefully, I remember the buttons.

2508
05:20:31,320 --> 05:20:33,320
After that, on Thursday,

2509
05:20:33,320 --> 05:20:36,320
we're gonna try Killer Seven again.

2510
05:20:39,320 --> 05:20:41,320
We're gonna try.

2511
05:20:41,320 --> 05:20:44,320
But there is a

2512
05:20:44,320 --> 05:20:46,320
chance

2513
05:20:46,320 --> 05:20:48,320
I might cancel it

2514
05:20:48,320 --> 05:20:51,320
if I just don't think I have the skills to do it.

2515
05:20:51,320 --> 05:20:53,320
I'm sorry.

2516
05:20:57,320 --> 05:20:59,320
I'm so sorry.

2517
05:20:59,320 --> 05:21:02,320
I don't know if I can actually be good at Killer Seven.

2518
05:21:02,320 --> 05:21:05,320
It might change to like

2519
05:21:05,320 --> 05:21:09,320
something really easy, like

2520
05:21:12,320 --> 05:21:15,320
it might change,

2521
05:21:15,320 --> 05:21:18,320
the game might change into like a

2522
05:21:20,320 --> 05:21:22,320
like a visual novel or something.

2523
05:21:22,320 --> 05:21:23,320
Something really easy.

2524
05:21:23,320 --> 05:21:25,320
Something that's like

2525
05:21:25,320 --> 05:21:27,320
brain turn off,

2526
05:21:27,320 --> 05:21:29,320
only just read.

2527
05:21:32,320 --> 05:21:34,320
But it really depends.

2528
05:21:34,320 --> 05:21:36,320
I'm hoping that

2529
05:21:36,320 --> 05:21:39,320
when I practice off-stream a little bit,

2530
05:21:39,320 --> 05:21:41,320
that I'll be good.

2531
05:21:41,320 --> 05:21:43,320
And if I'm not, and I start crying,

2532
05:21:43,320 --> 05:21:46,320
we're probably not gonna play Killer Seven.

2533
05:21:49,320 --> 05:21:52,320
Friday is an ASMR stream.

2534
05:21:52,320 --> 05:21:54,320
Mayhaps,

2535
05:21:54,320 --> 05:21:58,320
Senpais have noticed that the other Vealore girls

2536
05:21:58,320 --> 05:22:00,320
have also

2537
05:22:06,320 --> 05:22:08,320
have also

2538
05:22:10,320 --> 05:22:13,320
scheduled ASMR.

2539
05:22:13,320 --> 05:22:15,320
It's a

2540
05:22:18,320 --> 05:22:21,320
ASMR train.

2541
05:22:21,320 --> 05:22:24,320
All day ASMR

2542
05:22:25,320 --> 05:22:28,320
for your ears and tingles.

2543
05:22:33,320 --> 05:22:36,320
It's an ASMR train.

2544
05:22:37,320 --> 05:22:39,320
All day, six hours

2545
05:22:40,320 --> 05:22:42,320
of tingles.

2546
05:22:42,320 --> 05:22:44,320
It ends with me.

2547
05:22:48,320 --> 05:22:50,320
It ends with me.

2548
05:22:50,320 --> 05:22:52,320
It ends

2549
05:22:52,320 --> 05:22:54,320
and starts with Icy.

2550
05:22:55,320 --> 05:22:58,320
We're basically following our own schedule,

2551
05:22:58,320 --> 05:23:00,320
but this time

2552
05:23:00,320 --> 05:23:02,320
we're...

2553
05:23:03,320 --> 05:23:06,320
But this time,

2554
05:23:06,320 --> 05:23:08,320
we're only doing, I think,

2555
05:23:08,320 --> 05:23:10,320
two hours each,

2556
05:23:10,320 --> 05:23:12,320
and then we end

2557
05:23:12,320 --> 05:23:14,320
and then immediately raid

2558
05:23:14,320 --> 05:23:16,320
into each other,

2559
05:23:16,320 --> 05:23:18,320
and it will end with me.

2560
05:23:18,320 --> 05:23:20,320
Because I usually,

2561
05:23:20,320 --> 05:23:23,320
and I usually stream the latest, right?

2562
05:23:25,320 --> 05:23:28,320
So that day, I hope everyone can enjoy it,

2563
05:23:28,320 --> 05:23:30,320
because

2564
05:23:32,320 --> 05:23:35,320
I didn't know if I was being announced or not

2565
05:23:35,320 --> 05:23:37,320
on the official one,

2566
05:23:37,320 --> 05:23:40,320
but it was planned to be an ASMR train.

2567
05:23:40,320 --> 05:23:43,320
So, six hours of Vealore girls

2568
05:23:43,320 --> 05:23:46,320
trying to tingle the heck out of you.

2569
05:23:47,320 --> 05:23:50,320
And then on Saturday,

2570
05:23:50,320 --> 05:23:52,320
if you are a member

2571
05:23:52,320 --> 05:23:55,320
of the snippet tier or hire,

2572
05:23:55,320 --> 05:23:58,320
which there is no hire, there's only just that.

2573
05:23:59,320 --> 05:24:01,320
There is no hire,

2574
05:24:01,320 --> 05:24:03,320
he's a joke.

2575
05:24:03,320 --> 05:24:06,320
Although you...although YouTube will tell me

2576
05:24:06,320 --> 05:24:08,320
this one or hire.

2577
05:24:11,320 --> 05:24:14,320
Just like, anyone on this tier or hire,

2578
05:24:14,320 --> 05:24:16,320
and then I'm just like,

2579
05:24:16,320 --> 05:24:18,320
wait, but...

2580
05:24:18,320 --> 05:24:21,320
YouTube, it can't get any higher than that.

2581
05:24:24,320 --> 05:24:27,320
You all have an exclusive

2582
05:24:28,320 --> 05:24:30,320
cat girl ASMR.

2583
05:24:30,320 --> 05:24:32,320
With me!

2584
05:24:36,320 --> 05:24:38,320
Mercy!

2585
05:24:38,320 --> 05:24:40,320
Oh!

2586
05:24:40,320 --> 05:24:43,320
With me, Mercy, not Merciel.

2587
05:24:59,320 --> 05:25:01,320
Not Merciel.

2588
05:25:05,320 --> 05:25:08,320
Ohio, wow, everyone's feeding me again.

2589
05:25:16,320 --> 05:25:19,320
Mercy, when did you get here?

2590
05:25:19,320 --> 05:25:22,320
Oh yeah, it's been a while, huh?

2591
05:25:22,320 --> 05:25:25,320
I decided to take over after Merciel.

2592
05:25:29,320 --> 05:25:34,320
I figured Mercy,

2593
05:25:34,320 --> 05:25:36,320
Merciel's getting tired,

2594
05:25:36,320 --> 05:25:39,320
but so am I, it's been a long day.

2595
05:25:49,320 --> 05:25:52,320
Yeah, Merciel right into Mercy.

2596
05:25:54,320 --> 05:25:57,320
You and Merciel share a similar face?

2597
05:25:57,320 --> 05:25:59,320
No.

2598
05:25:59,320 --> 05:26:01,320
No.

2599
05:26:01,320 --> 05:26:05,320
Merciel has a mustache and a big button nose.

2600
05:26:06,320 --> 05:26:08,320
I don't have a mustache.

2601
05:26:16,320 --> 05:26:19,320
I don't have a mustache, we're completely different.

2602
05:26:27,320 --> 05:26:29,320
No.

2603
05:26:36,320 --> 05:26:38,320
We're completely different.

2604
05:26:38,320 --> 05:26:40,320
Is this Lord Secret's brother name?

2605
05:26:40,320 --> 05:26:43,320
No, Merciel has a brother name...

2606
05:26:44,320 --> 05:26:46,320
Lushibi.

2607
05:26:57,320 --> 05:26:59,320
Lushibi.

2608
05:27:27,320 --> 05:27:30,320
I thought the Merciel gained three sisters.

2609
05:27:33,320 --> 05:27:36,320
Do you think sisters will have such an amazing girl,

2610
05:27:36,320 --> 05:27:39,320
glorious stash with a huge button nose?

2611
05:27:39,320 --> 05:27:41,320
I don't think so.

2612
05:27:57,320 --> 05:28:07,320
I ask you this, have you ever seen,

2613
05:28:07,320 --> 05:28:12,320
seen Merciel from the chest, from the neck down?

2614
05:28:12,320 --> 05:28:14,320
I don't think so.

2615
05:28:18,320 --> 05:28:20,320
Or at least I don't recall.

2616
05:28:27,320 --> 05:28:53,320
Anyway, yeah, you have, you have a membership with me.

2617
05:28:54,320 --> 05:29:11,320
And it will be my first time doing a cat girl ASMR.

2618
05:29:11,320 --> 05:29:17,320
Please do not judge me on how bad I purr.

2619
05:29:18,320 --> 05:29:31,320
Or at least be nice to me, but I will do my best to be super nice to my wonderful owners.

2620
05:29:42,320 --> 05:29:45,320
I'm probably not going to purr to sing.

2621
05:29:48,320 --> 05:29:51,320
Did you practice purring at all?

2622
05:29:51,320 --> 05:29:53,320
I don't want to talk about it.

2623
05:29:58,320 --> 05:30:01,320
I don't want to talk about my purring.

2624
05:30:06,320 --> 05:30:08,320
I'm pretty sure it's terrible.

2625
05:30:09,320 --> 05:30:13,320
It'll be the one in the cage this time.

2626
05:30:13,320 --> 05:30:16,320
You leave your cat in a cage all day?

2627
05:30:21,320 --> 05:30:22,320
No.

2628
05:30:23,320 --> 05:30:28,320
Cats must, must cause havoc when you get home.

2629
05:30:30,320 --> 05:30:32,320
The cat is free.

2630
05:30:39,320 --> 05:30:44,320
Can we get a purring sample please, Kohai?

2631
05:30:45,320 --> 05:30:46,320
No.

2632
05:30:47,320 --> 05:30:51,320
It will just sound like I'm gurgling like frogs or something.

2633
05:30:55,320 --> 05:31:07,320
Also, that should be only exclusive to the, to the, to the, to the, to the, what do you call it?

2634
05:31:09,320 --> 05:31:11,320
Member stream anyways.

2635
05:31:13,320 --> 05:31:17,320
It should be only exclusive to the members stream anyways.

2636
05:31:24,320 --> 05:31:28,320
It's only exclusive to members and you will have to see it all that day.

2637
05:31:31,320 --> 05:31:36,320
And then after that, Sunday is a day off.

2638
05:31:37,320 --> 05:31:42,320
And then I'd like to, and then I already have the following week scheduled.

2639
05:31:47,320 --> 05:31:52,320
And then after that, I'll post up the schedule for the following week.

2640
05:31:52,320 --> 05:31:56,320
And then we have another full week together.

2641
05:31:58,320 --> 05:32:01,320
But the following week, the week after next week,

2642
05:32:02,320 --> 05:32:12,320
starting on the 8th to the 14th will be my vacation time.

2643
05:32:13,320 --> 05:32:16,320
I'm going out with the girls.

2644
05:32:16,320 --> 05:32:18,320
I don't know what we're doing.

2645
05:32:19,320 --> 05:32:20,320
Going out of town.

2646
05:32:24,320 --> 05:32:30,320
I think we might be going camping, but it doesn't look like we're, we have like a plan set yet.

2647
05:32:31,320 --> 05:32:34,320
I'm not doing the itinerary this time the girls are.

2648
05:32:36,320 --> 05:32:40,320
So, um, I'll see, I'll see.

2649
05:32:40,320 --> 05:32:49,320
Oh, I'll probably won't know until like I get there or like maybe it's going to be like one of those things where we just kind of,

2650
05:32:49,320 --> 05:32:53,320
we kind of just like do whatever, you know?

2651
05:32:53,320 --> 05:33:02,320
So that will be my vacation.

2652
05:33:02,320 --> 05:33:05,320
I haven't taken like a real vacation in a while.

2653
05:33:05,320 --> 05:33:11,320
My last vacation was, well, going to Vietnam and then visiting family.

2654
05:33:11,320 --> 05:33:14,320
And that didn't really feel like a vacation at all.

2655
05:33:15,320 --> 05:33:16,320
You know?

2656
05:33:16,320 --> 05:33:20,320
I didn't feel like a vacation at all.

2657
05:33:20,320 --> 05:33:23,320
Just feel, felt like, you know, like a duty.

2658
05:33:29,320 --> 05:33:32,320
It felt like a duty because, you know, it was family.

2659
05:33:32,320 --> 05:33:33,320
Yeah.

2660
05:33:33,320 --> 05:33:35,320
It's doing stuff with family.

2661
05:33:35,320 --> 05:33:45,320
And then like, uh, it was like visiting family and then also going to,

2662
05:33:45,320 --> 05:33:54,320
to like, I think we were, uh, what's the word?

2663
05:33:54,320 --> 05:33:56,320
Well, what was the word?

2664
05:33:56,320 --> 05:34:06,320
Uh, like, I had a lot of things like, um, had to, had to go to like visit family graves and stuff and pray,

2665
05:34:07,320 --> 05:34:15,320
uh, pray since, uh, there's some, and then also like, uh, kind of being like meeting,

2666
05:34:15,320 --> 05:34:21,320
meeting, um, meeting up with family members I haven't seen in a long time,

2667
05:34:21,320 --> 05:34:25,320
which was a lot of it was countryside stuff.

2668
05:34:25,320 --> 05:34:28,320
It was not, it wasn't a relaxing experience.

2669
05:34:28,320 --> 05:34:29,320
No.

2670
05:34:29,320 --> 05:34:34,320
Every day I had to go to a new, new, new place and then meet, meet new family members

2671
05:34:34,320 --> 05:34:36,320
or extended family members.

2672
05:34:36,320 --> 05:34:39,320
And yeah, it was, it was a lot.

2673
05:34:39,320 --> 05:34:40,320
It was a lot.

2674
05:34:40,320 --> 05:34:41,320
It was a lot.

2675
05:34:42,320 --> 05:34:43,320
It was a lot.

2676
05:34:43,320 --> 05:34:45,320
So it didn't really feel like a vacation vacation.

2677
05:34:45,320 --> 05:34:48,320
I think I went to the beach like twice and that was it.

2678
05:34:51,320 --> 05:34:56,320
Even though I took the fight quite some time off, it didn't feel like a real vacation.

2679
05:34:56,320 --> 05:35:00,320
So this one hopefully feels like a real vacation.

2680
05:35:00,320 --> 05:35:01,320
Hopefully.

2681
05:35:05,320 --> 05:35:06,320
Okay.

2682
05:35:13,320 --> 05:35:15,320
Is the water warm at the beaches there?

2683
05:35:16,320 --> 05:35:17,320
Uh.

2684
05:35:19,320 --> 05:35:22,320
No, it's, it's, it's okay.

2685
05:35:22,320 --> 05:35:25,320
It's cool, but it's not like cold.

2686
05:35:25,320 --> 05:35:26,320
You know what I mean?

2687
05:35:27,320 --> 05:35:33,320
The only thing I didn't like was that it was kind of dirty.

2688
05:35:33,320 --> 05:35:37,320
Like the beach was really dirty and full of litter and it made me really sad.

2689
05:35:38,320 --> 05:35:46,320
Made me really sad and I got really, really, really pissed because like plastic and stuff

2690
05:35:46,320 --> 05:35:48,320
were cutting my ankles.

2691
05:35:48,320 --> 05:35:52,320
So I was very upset with the state of the beach.

2692
05:35:57,320 --> 05:36:02,320
I got stung by a jellyfish in Vietnam.

2693
05:36:02,320 --> 05:36:03,320
Not a great time.

2694
05:36:03,320 --> 05:36:05,320
I'm sorry about that.

2695
05:36:05,320 --> 05:36:10,320
But yeah, I didn't really enjoy the beach because like it was, there was so much litter

2696
05:36:10,320 --> 05:36:12,320
and I felt so sad.

2697
05:36:12,320 --> 05:36:17,320
I tried to clean it up, but like there was just so much, you know?

2698
05:36:19,320 --> 05:36:22,320
So I wasn't, it wasn't a good thing.

2699
05:36:27,320 --> 05:36:31,320
I can't, I couldn't do it by myself or anything either.

2700
05:36:31,320 --> 05:36:40,320
And I feel like it had to be, had to be like, uh,

2701
05:36:45,320 --> 05:36:50,320
it has to be like a, a like, like a work thing.

2702
05:36:50,320 --> 05:36:53,320
Like someone has to get paid to like do it.

2703
05:36:53,320 --> 05:36:55,320
I didn't have any like garbage bags with me either.

2704
05:36:55,320 --> 05:37:02,320
So all I could do was just put it in like a, like in a corner, you know?

2705
05:37:05,320 --> 05:37:06,320
That's it.

2706
05:37:08,320 --> 05:37:18,320
So that's generally, um, so that's why I was like, uh, yeah, it requires a really big effort.

2707
05:37:18,320 --> 05:37:20,320
There was so much, there was so much garbage.

2708
05:37:20,320 --> 05:37:21,320
I just couldn't do it.

2709
05:37:21,320 --> 05:37:24,320
It was not an effort that I could do alone.

2710
05:37:24,320 --> 05:37:29,320
Otherwise it would take off on my vacation time as well.

2711
05:37:35,320 --> 05:37:40,320
So yeah, it was just like, oh, you know, your, your picture perfect,

2712
05:37:40,320 --> 05:37:44,320
like beach experience was not exactly picture perfect.

2713
05:37:44,320 --> 05:37:54,320
So yeah, hopefully, so I'm going to have a mini vacation probably.

2714
05:37:55,320 --> 05:38:01,320
I'll probably be just like hanging out with girls, with girls.

2715
05:38:03,320 --> 05:38:09,320
So during that time, I hope some pies be good and hold each other accountable.

2716
05:38:09,320 --> 05:38:19,320
Make sure no one escapes or has wandering eyes.

2717
05:38:40,320 --> 05:38:44,320
So I trust my senpais.

2718
05:38:44,320 --> 05:38:46,320
I'm not sure if we're going camping.

2719
05:38:46,320 --> 05:38:51,320
If we are going camping, there's probably not going to be any signal like at all.

2720
05:38:51,320 --> 05:38:57,320
So I might not be able to update, uh, anyone about anything.

2721
05:38:57,320 --> 05:39:00,320
So that is, is a risk.

2722
05:39:01,320 --> 05:39:03,320
Yeah.

2723
05:39:06,320 --> 05:39:07,320
So yeah, that's about it.

2724
05:39:07,320 --> 05:39:09,320
That's all I have for today.

2725
05:39:09,320 --> 05:39:11,320
Um, I'm going to go eat.

2726
05:39:11,320 --> 05:39:12,320
I don't know.

2727
05:39:12,320 --> 05:39:17,320
I'm so tired today and usually I can go for much longer,

2728
05:39:17,320 --> 05:39:19,320
but I'm just exhausted right now.

2729
05:39:19,320 --> 05:39:21,320
I'm so exhausted.

2730
05:39:22,320 --> 05:39:25,320
What do you think you'll find out about the itinerary?

2731
05:39:25,320 --> 05:39:28,320
Honestly, probably the day of.

2732
05:39:29,320 --> 05:39:34,320
Probably the day of because the girls are kind of like that.

2733
05:39:34,320 --> 05:39:36,320
They do everything super last minute.

2734
05:39:42,320 --> 05:39:44,320
It's a surprise.

2735
05:39:50,320 --> 05:39:51,320
It's a surprise.

2736
05:39:51,320 --> 05:39:53,320
I don't know what it's going to be.

2737
05:39:54,320 --> 05:40:04,320
So I'm going to be flexible and as long as we have a place to stay or we have plans

2738
05:40:04,320 --> 05:40:12,320
and I know a little bit ahead of time, what we're doing that I can prepare.

2739
05:40:12,320 --> 05:40:17,320
Luckily, if it's camping, I have all the camping gear that I can bring right away.

2740
05:40:17,320 --> 05:40:19,320
So that's not an issue.

2741
05:40:19,320 --> 05:40:20,320
That's not an issue.

2742
05:40:20,320 --> 05:40:22,320
I'm pretty prepared for that.

2743
05:40:22,320 --> 05:40:29,320
But if it is like, oh, it's just like, you know, staying at a hotel going out to cafes

2744
05:40:29,320 --> 05:40:35,320
and like going to like museums, then that's nice too, you know?

2745
05:40:42,320 --> 05:40:43,320
Those are nice too.

2746
05:40:43,320 --> 05:40:47,320
Or if there's like an event happening that they're going to bring me to, I don't really know.

2747
05:40:50,320 --> 05:40:54,320
So thank you, senpai, for joining me today.

2748
05:40:54,320 --> 05:41:04,320
Even though my brain is fried and my gaming skills, mainly the platforming skills, it's also fried.

2749
05:41:11,320 --> 05:41:14,320
So I love you all.

2750
05:41:15,320 --> 05:41:17,320
Nobody's on, right?

2751
05:41:17,320 --> 05:41:20,320
Usually when I'm streaming, nobody's streaming.

2752
05:41:20,320 --> 05:41:49,320
I don't think I see anyone.

2753
05:41:49,320 --> 05:41:52,320
So I'm just going to end it here.

2754
05:41:52,320 --> 05:41:57,320
Thank you for joining me today.

2755
05:41:57,320 --> 05:42:02,320
And I'll see you again tomorrow.

2756
05:42:05,320 --> 05:42:06,320
Today.

2757
05:42:07,320 --> 05:42:10,320
Tomorrow, which is considered today.

2758
05:42:10,320 --> 05:42:11,320
Yeah.

2759
05:42:13,320 --> 05:42:15,320
Okay, scream for mercy.

2760
05:42:15,320 --> 05:42:17,320
Bye-bye.

2761
05:42:19,320 --> 05:42:21,320
Bye-bye.

2762
05:42:49,320 --> 05:42:51,320
Thank you.
