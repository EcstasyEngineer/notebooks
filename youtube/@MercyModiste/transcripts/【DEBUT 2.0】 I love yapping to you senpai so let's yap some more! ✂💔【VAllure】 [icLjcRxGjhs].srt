00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:44,940
Hi everyone. Sorry I'm a bit late. Bad news. I'm feeling a little under the weather by

2
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:53,360
under the weather. I mean, not sad, but like, you know, not well. So if I sound a bit funny,

3
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:15,760
I apologize for that. That's just me. That's just me, but it's because I do have emergency

4
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:23,840
stuff in here. And I will, and then I do have a BRB screen in case I need to like, you know,

5
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:39,040
yeah. So there we go. So forgive me, it really just happened not too long ago. I was coughing

6
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:48,560
up. I felt like I was coughing up the lung. So if if I if suddenly I would I start coughing in a

7
00:07:48,560 --> 00:08:02,240
nice sound weird. That's why. Did you eat some bad color fish? No. No, I wouldn't eat. No, maybe.

8
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:13,360
Next question. Anyways, probably nerves. Yeah, probably nerves. But welcome everyone to my two

9
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:24,400
point. Oh, the debut debut debut. Sorry. debutant. We'll get right to business. I like I like getting

10
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,080
my charts out of the way. So we'll start with tags first. No, general take is not indulge. A general

11
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,280
take is a tag that I want for you guys. If you guys want to be like, Oh my gosh, I love Mercy so

12
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:44,560
much as you should. Oh my God, I love Mercy so much. I want I want her to see my my love letter

13
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:52,080
to her that I posted on Twitter. I need something like that. So I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking

14
00:08:52,080 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm thinking just mercy mode east. Which one of these would a fan song go under? I believe that'll

15
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:17,360
be art. I know it's like, I said art is like modellus list. But like, music is art. Anything is art.

16
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
Hear me out. Okay, that was pretty good.

17
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,640
Scissor mercy, scissor me, mama mercy. I'm not the mama here. I'm not the mama here. We've

18
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,600
got three mothers. We've got three mothers, which is, of course, mom, a mommy being one mother,

19
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:44,240
second mother being, um, Azura, who has lovingly given us a raid. Thank you so much.

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:55,760
And as well as she be she be the toilet is, uh, is our third mother.

21
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,920
Excuse me.

22
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:18,080
Don't die though. I'm so sorry. I like literally. I get really flummy sometimes. That just happens.

It just happens. Oh my gosh. Is that meadow and meadow and chat. Hi. I'm you met plus. Wow.

25
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:44,240
They are so cute. Have mercy. Okay. I love the, I love these tags, except for one thing.

26
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,800
One thing my lovely senpai, my senpais is that, um, we gotta make them sort of unique

27
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,800
so that, you know, some rando, I don't either one take over some Randall's tag, although I can.

28
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,800
I too, I don't, uh, it doesn't get mixed in with like someone's, someone's book club, you know?

29
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,760
Shear me out is a good one. Yeah. You know what? Shear me out is a good one. Yeah. You know what?

30
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,240
Yeah. Heck yeah. Let's do that. You know, here for my general tag is

31
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,040
Shear me out. Wow. So good.

32
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,400
Modesty cuts. Modesty cuts. Shear me out. Yeah. That's pretty good, right? So if you write me

33
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,560
love letters, it's a general tag. Just be like, Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Mercy. Shear me out. Okay.

34
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:57,520
So it's good. Yeah. Uh, live. Personally, I don't know if I like

35
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:07,040
mm online because mm online was just like Mercy Mode East online. Mercy time.

36
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Mercy time for live. That's a good one. I'm not as creative as my lovely senpais. My senpais are

37
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,320
also amazingly creative. Sounds like MMO. Yeah. That's my issue. That's my issue is that it sounds

38
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:35,760
like MMO and I was like, Oh, you're right. Time for mercy. Show mercy. That sounds like

39
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm literally taking over a tag that of someone, of someone at their like little book club.

40
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,200
That's gotta do. No mercy. Mercy. No mercy.

41
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,040
Stock o'clock. Mercy lane. Snippity clippy. No. Snippity. Snippy clippy for clips. That

42
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,960
sounds good too. Big for mercy. No mercy. Sheer time. Mode East live.

43
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:09,920
Streaming mercy. Like screaming. Oh my god. Cosy too high. Oh my god. These are really good.

44
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,680
Mmm. I like that. I like that. I do like that. Streaming.

45
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:31,040
How about this guys? Okay. Stream for mercy. Huh? Huh? Anybody?

46
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:45,040
Stream for mercy. Do you like four as the number four or like the word four?

47
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,960
Like you can do like a stream, stream, stream, stream,

48
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:04,640
for mercy versus stream, stream, for mercy. What do you guys think? Four for sure? Okay.

49
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,120
We're all such a team. We're such a team. And this is why I keep you guys in my basement.

50
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:24,160
Four is the more I hit with the kids.

51
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,280
And in before Sheer Me Out is also an Ask Me Anything tag for people who Sheer Sheep. Oh.

52
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,640
No. We're good. We're good. We're going to take it over. We're going to take it over.

53
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,400
Okay. So clips, clips, clips, clips. Let's do some clips.

54
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,200
I like it down here, but maybe you can install it in dehumidifier. No.

55
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,680
Wait. I don't know the difference between a dehumidifier and a humidifier. The reason why

56
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,480
I'm just like a humidifier has like, it causes moding. And I don't want that. I want you to live

57
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,560
in the best situation ever, Senpai. That's why I put in like those shiny glow in the dark

58
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,840
stickers of stars. So it looks like you're laying underneath the stars in the cage.

59
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Modest clips. Clips out for Mercy. Snippa Snippas is a fan name. No.

And I said, okay, give me a second. Give me a second. I'm gonna think of something real clever, right?

130
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,180
Oh

131
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:06,020
Hold on I need to start Google something because I need to remember why I picked a certain name. I

132
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,460
Need to find the right word because I'm kind of stupid

133
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:30,340
Okay, okay, okay, okay, I got it again. Okay, okay, so at first at first I I picked a name

134
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,340
I

135
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:39,020
Picked a name so I picked the name when I first started. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,660
You're off you're off kayfabe. We're we're gonna like riot right now

137
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Okay, so

138
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,920
The name that I chose was Lane

139
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,780
L8 I and

140
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,940
Beetled I chose Lane because of Chamber Lane

141
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,940
I

142
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,180
Last name was always going to be Mojist

143
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,580
Lane like Lane

144
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,220
Lane

145
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,340
Short for Chamber Lane, which is like, you know, Victorian ladies have this like a little belt

146
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,660
Belt where they would have like sewing supplies on them. So I took the name from like Chamber Lane

147
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,220
Which I was like, oh, yeah, I'm so creative this is gonna so pass

148
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,620
This is gonna pass so well like this is perfect and then

149
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,780
Stranny was like

150
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,940
So the staff wants to call you mercy and I said

151
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Actually

152
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,020
It was you

153
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,860
But yeah, I would chose that and then it got of course

154
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,780
Beato

155
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,020

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340

That I picked out personally because some of you guys

237
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,020
Most of the things I'm so really surprised most of my morals are not

00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,260
Questions they are a lot of elements

239
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,580

240
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:07,900
I love you. Good luck on debut and I felt really really really inspired and I felt like you know in

241
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,300
Dragon Ball where they were like give me your energy

242
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,900
And

243
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,540
Then I like gathered everyone's energy and then I I managed to make it through debut

244
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:27,540
I was super nervous, but I still do it anyways. We'll talk about some of my likes and my dislikes a little bit

245
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
All right

246
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,620
We're there any of them compliments about your patreon audio

247
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:43,700
Um, yeah, I was actually surprised because I was like

248
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:51,020
I'll talk about this more after I answer this question. You know what we gotta we get we need to have order in here

249
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,780
Senpai otherwise you go crazy and we can't have you going crazy

250
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,580
So

251
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Hold on. Let me get this out of my way

252
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,700
My my my my my notepads in my way

253
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:12,660
You said you like SMT4 in debut, so how do you feel about SMT5 apocalypse play through play through when it comes out

254
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,180
Okay, so I won't answer this truthfully. I have SMT5 and

255
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,860
The reason why 5 is not my favorite and I wouldn't play apocalypse is because

256
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,980
beacons

257
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:34,220
When I played, you know, the little exploration area and the 3d exploration area. I got a really bad motion sickness

258
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,700
I

259
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Really bad

260
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,700
Motion sickness. I was just

261
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,420
I was uh, uh, I don't know why 4 was great probably because it's on a

262
00:39:52,700 --> 00:40:00,540
And a smaller screen a smaller screen on the DS. So I was I was probably okay with it, but when I

263
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
I

264
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,740
Play played 5 I was like

265
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:17,020
But I bought I bought for you for you guys. So I have a theory I want to test with my senpai

266
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,740
So with my senpai's I want to test the theory, which is I'm going to slowly build

267
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,780
my

268
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,780
My uh tolerance

269
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:33,420
To 3d 3d motion and 3 games and I'm gonna see if I can build it up

270
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,540
through years

271
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,940
So I know a lot of a lot of people

272
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,380
Grew up with games. I did not grow up with games

273
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,460
So I figured maybe I can play games like

274
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
well

275
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Uh gold and I

276
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Like gold and I

277
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,740
And then move on through years

278
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,740
Through the years to play more modern games. Does that make sense?

279
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,060
I feel like I I feel like that's what I should do

280
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,540
Get motion sickness glasses. Guess what I do have those dorky

281
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,500
Motion sickness glasses. I wonder if I still have

282
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,460
If I have I make them into an ass that long long ago

283
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,220
Hold on

284
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,220
I have these dorky ass glasses

285
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,540
That look like this so they have like

286
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,540
Uh little liquid the the thing is that it's supposed to

287
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
So

288
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:52,380
Help with uh motion sickness. Um because of the liquid will help stabilize blah blah blah something signs you can look it up

289
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,700
Anyways, uh

290
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,940
I bought I went out and actually bought these glasses

291
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Real not fake

292
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,620
I bought these glasses and guess what the liquid in them evaporated

293
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,960
And evaporated and I went now they just look like dorky glasses

294
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
Oh

295
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,560
It's okay

296
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,920
What I would rip off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was but I got it on sale

297
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,760
I got it on sale for like three dollars three three dollary dues

298
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
So it was fine

299
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,840
So it was fine. So that's why I have like super bad motion sickness

300
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,280
Um, do you guys want to hear a story about how I discovered I have motion sickness?

301
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
So

302
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
I've done this story many times already

303
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,360
um

304
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,120
To classify what sort of sickness motion sickness I have it's specifically screen sickness

305
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Yeah, so

306
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,760
So screen sickness I was in class

307
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,920
Okay, I sit in the front row of class because I'm a try hard student

308
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
honors all that

309
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,720
Okay

310
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,160
I I work hard and school in school

311
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
So

312
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,520
Shut up. Yeah, I'm a good ko hi. I'm a good ko hi

313
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,080
I'm a good ko hi. I paid off my I paid off student loans and stuff with with basically

314
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
grants and scholarships

315
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,320
Anyways, so a science eating. No, I wanted to sit in the front because I one I can't see

316
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,320
I have is it near-sightedness where you can't really see far away

317
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
Anyways

318
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,920
I I forgot I forgot so yeah near-sightedness probably, um

319
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,760
I sat in the front and then we watched I was a screening so I took a lot of

320
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:43,280
Cinematography classes and and film studies classes because I really like I really like films. I really like film. It's really fun. Um

321
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
So

322
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,400
I sat in the front and then we were watching 2001 a space Odyssey. You're gonna hear about the story a lot

323
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,720
2001 a space Odyssey is a story that oh that always comes up

324
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,800
And to that space Odyssey, you know the stargate sequence

325
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,640
so, you know the stargate sequence where um

326
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,160
What's his face is going through time and then it's going really fast and you he's just going whoa

327
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that that part I was watching that part intensely and then

328
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,920
I was like, oh, I'm starting to cough

329
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
And then I threw up in front of everyone

330
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
And

331
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,880
That's how I discovered I had screams slash most in most sickness

332
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,640
And then I had to excuse myself bathroom was there come back in clean it clean it all up

333
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
Ah

334
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,120
Life is uh

335
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,080
Life gets you hard

336
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,160
So if anyone remembers that day, uh, no, you don't

337
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,840
Yeah, don't know you don't it was on a big screen. So it was a big projector as well. So it was

338
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,160
Yeah, it was embarrassing. I didn't say that as like my cringe moment in life because I didn't think it was that cringe

339
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
I thought it was just funny

340
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,160
Cringe though. I've got so much cringe in my life. I had to pick something

341
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,040
Are you okay at the movies? Yeah, I'm okay most movies most movies are fine

342
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Most if something kind of like, you know

343
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
If something, um

344
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,720
Oh, you threw up on the projector. Now I threw up all over like the desk and floor

345
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,560
Um, I go for the non 3d movies

346
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,280
So I don't I I picked the standard standard edition one

347
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,480
So I don't really get the glasses in or anything

348
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,920
So like projectile plummeting

349
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,120
Shut up shut up senpai

350
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,520
Sort of yes

351
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,720
Is there a certain genre you avoid like action or horror

352
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,240
At the movie for that reason, uh, there's a reason why I don't really watch like bay movies, you know

353
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,120
Hmm

354
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,160
But usually I tend to watch standard standard should be fine. And if I feel like I'm gonna like

355
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:51,760
I uh, I close my eyes. I don't see it. I close my eyes

356
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,120
So date night on john wick movie is not a great idea

357
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,200
Um, a john wick movie will probably be on like a standard tv size. So like just maybe like at home

358
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,240
At home tv. Yeah, are you guys saying you want to go on a date with me? Is that what you're saying?

359
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,680
So, um, I do not see it

360
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,400
That's why I don't really feel like I would play smt

361
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,640
Five apocalypse unless I played smt five first but smt five caused me to like

362
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:39,840
But smt four apocalypse was like really fun. I got stuck on one part though. There was an item that

363
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,200
Was an item there's a place that I tried to find but I couldn't find so I couldn't proceed with the game

364
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,360
for uh

365
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:55,040
smt four apocalypse. It was really fun though. I really liked uh playing it. Uh, I have fond memories of of um

366
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
of smt

367
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,520
smt force in particular. It's not very punishing. I don't think

368
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,920
And I I was able to finish it. So that's

369
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,520
That's pretty good

370
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,760
But mercy, what if you tried 2001 a space odyssey on acid?

371
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,120
I got offered that choice and I said

372
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
Thanks, but no thanks

373
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,080
How about roller coasters? I don't feel that great on roller coasters either. So I tried to avoid them

374
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,360
Some of them I do okay on which is weird

375
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,520
but

376
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,400
Uh, generally I feel like my motion sickness has been

377
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,840
mostly to do with the screen stuff anything with the screen. So if I see like, oh

378
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,640
First person stuff. Oh my gosh, like a game that I feel

379
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,440
Really makes me throw yuppie

380
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,280
Yeah, what's that free game more frame? Yeah, war frame makes me really throw yuppie

381
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:17,440
So that's one thing that I feel like knock turn I feel like was a little punishing for smt. So I didn't really like it

382
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,160
Yeah

383
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Yeah, and then I played smt one

384
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,280
The ios because it was released on the ios and the touch buttons were really hard. So I didn't really

385
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,680
Go through it. Have you tried vr funny enough? I don't know why but I have less motion sickness in vr

386
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,680
But I just can't afford a headset

387
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,480
I I just don't have a headset. So I've been borrowing

388
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Oh

389
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,080
Would you play vengeance smt five or no, mm same thing

390
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,440
They are cheaper now they are but I'm still

391
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,040
I'm so poor. I live with my parents. So you guys are stuck with me in my basement with my parents

392
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
You're welcome

393
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:26,560
Okay, so next question out of all the vtuber corporations out there, why did you choose to apply to this one?

394
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,720
Oh

395
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,920
This is a little bit of a harder question, but I guess the way I can sum it up is that scrawny gave me a chance

396
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,680
Um, I wasn't very

397
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,120
picky

398
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,800
so to say

399
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
with uh applying to places

400
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,560
So

401
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,920
I tend to I got a

402
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,640
I tend to choose

403
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,440
Places that I feel like I would probably thrive in

404
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,640
And so I would apply to there

405
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,880
but I'm not that

406
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,880
Picky

407
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,840
Picky so to say but at the same time when scrawny

408
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,040
When scrawny did the announcement. I was like, okay, I'm kind of interested in this company

409
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,280
I'm kind of interested in this company

410
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,880
Let's see and I decided to watch her stream talking about it

411
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
So

412
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,840
When I saw her stream talking about I felt very moved

413
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,560
I felt very moved like honestly

414
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:50,640
I felt like I was like, you know, you ever just feel like your heart throb a little bit when you see someone

415
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:58,080
Or you hear some some speech or see a wonderful movie. I felt that I felt that when I heard scrawny talk about the company

416
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,480
And

417
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,520
I was

418
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:11,600
Really, I was really moved by her goals and what she wanted and I actually truly believed in her dreams

419
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
So

420
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,880
I truly believe in her dreams. So

421
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,000
You know, I

422
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
am probably

423
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm probably the least out of everyone here. I'm the least

424
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,440
familiar

425
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,440
with

426
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,440
asmr and

427
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,560
Asmr and kind of like, you know, the alternative stuff, right?

428
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,160
So

429
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,200
So, um

430
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,280
I'm still learning

431
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,760
The caveat when they said that

432
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,920
Uh

433
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:06,480
That you needed 18 plus experience. I do have that. I played a lot of of of of alternate games

434
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,320
So it's all new to you. Mm-hmm. Well asmr and stuff streaming and v tubing not so much

435
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,400
So I played uh

436
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,240
Errol gay basically, I'll just say it outright. I played Errol gay on stream

437
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And that was enough that was enough

438
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,800
So I have to play, um

439
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:45,040
So I'm basically learning as I go so a lot of times I

440
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,040
Excuse me

441
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
Hmm

442
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,120
Okay, I um, I played

443
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,080
18 plus games

444
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,840
Uh, so I'm not familiar with asmr or anything. I

445
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,520
So when I signed on I was I would bother scrawny a lot like scrawny scrawny

446
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,840
What does this mean?

447
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,840
What is this?

448
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,600
So I would say something like, um, let's see one of my recordings. I was like

449
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,600
Really confused by something so

450
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,960
I guess I can tell you what it is. It's not it's not too bad. So I basically asked scrawny scrawny

451
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
What's the countdown?

452
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,480
And I would go scrawny

453
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,600
Do I have to say the numbers?

454
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,320
And scrawny goes, yes, yes, please say the numbers

455
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,560
Okay, I come back maybe another time going

456
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,760
I say brown noise, what does that mean?

457
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,880
Or I go scrawny

458
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,720
Why these globe things?

459
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,360
So I'm very I'm very ignorant

460
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,600
Ignorant naive

461
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,760
Dang did you almost talk a looty there? Yeah

462
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:12,320
So I would be like what are these? What are these? What does this mean? And I would just go like

463
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,320
I would

464
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,840
So I would bother scrawny a lot with them and she would be like it means this it means this

465
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,560
She's been very nice to me. I feel like there's time for should be like

466
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
Listen mercy. You probably just need to google it

467
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
I

468
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,920
I'm learning very slowly

469
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,640
But yeah, everyone's been super nice to me I've been

470
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,040
Kind of experimenting with certain things

471
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
um asmr is very new to me

472
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,560
so is kind of like

473
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:08,560
You know alternative content as well, so it's very new so please take care of me senpai. I'm literally giving you my virginity

474
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,080
Asmr virginity I should probably probably say that

475
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:32,640
So be nice, okay be nice, uh, there is an audio that I'm a little worried about that people might not

476
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,160
Like so just know that I'm studying I get feedback all the time

477
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,200
I get feedback from all the time and then

478
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,120
Um

479
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,120
And I'm improving all the time

480
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
At least I think I am

481
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
Okay

482
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,360
So I hope you guys are super understanding with that

483
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,840
Thanks

484
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,600
So I literally study a whole lot so since I'm so new to this I study a whole lot

485
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,800
I think the reason why I

486
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,880
am okay

487
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,280
At my which I'm really surprised people have complimented a lot on my first audio

488
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
I think the reason why I did

489
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,680
I'm doing okay is because I do have an acting background

490
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,280
I I have a very extensive acting background

491
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,520
All right, so let's move on I'm getting embarrassed now

492
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,320
Oh

493
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,920
Well all kind of acting

494
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,920
Stage plays movies television stuff like that

495
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,160
Things like that

496
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:20,080
So I have a bit of a bit of that I've also did a lot of training back

497
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,760
Back and make myself sound so old

498
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:31,680
Uh back when I was doing a lot of acting I took a lot of classes. So I'm pretty I think I'm pretty decently trained

499
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,480
But I'm really rusty. I'm really rusty

500
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:49,200
Yeah, I'm I'm super super rusty and uh

501
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:58,400
And so, um, I'm really polishing polishing it up with with this

502
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,600
Uh, yeah

503
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:14,480
Okay, what unique quality do you think makes you stand out from the rest of the girls for the sake of not being controversial

504
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:20,080
I'm not sure what they're trying to say. You're sorry senpai. I don't know what you're really trying to say by controversial

505
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,320
What unique skills do you think you have?

506
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,760
Are you having fun?

507
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,360
Um, of course I'm having the the blah blah. I'm having a blast

508
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:39,600
You mean it's all you don't really love us. It was on act. I didn't say that I didn't say that

509
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,720
It means I can be whatever you want me to be senpai, that's all

510
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,360
So

511
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,800
Uh, what unique qualities make you stand out from the rest of the girls

512
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,400
Well, I'm a different person first off my laughs are probably what most people

513
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,960
notice when they stand out that stands up the most and I have

514
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Well a really different voice

515
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:24,080
Can you be somebody not like I like you anything

516
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,640
Wait, you're not yet every ends up. What the fuck do you mean put yourself back here right now?

517
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,600
Um, I guess I do have a little bit of the acting background so

518
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,720
And I think out of everyone

519
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,680
I think

520
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,560
I'm not quite sure I need I need to confirm this but I think I am

521
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,680
The longest streamer or the most

522
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,960
Season streamer

523
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,360
Out of my gen mates

524
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,160
Probably

525
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:22,560
Probably that what unique skills do I have

526
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:31,840
You can always argue that skills aren't unique and that they can be honed etc, but I would say that

527
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,520
That

528
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,160
I guess I'm truly in this

529
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:50,880
To improve and continually improve. I don't know. That's not really unique to me. You know what?

530
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Forget this question

531
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:03,200
Frequent forget this question. I'm good at taking care of my senpais. I'm good at loving my senpais. I'm good at

532
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:10,640
At making sure that they stay obedient and don't break out of the lock

533
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,240
There's 10 locks on that by the way on that door

534
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,160
So I feel like

535
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:32,480
What makes me unique is being myself I suppose

536
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:42,720
Yes, I am in love with all my senpais, but I think in a way that is in self as unique charm

537
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,200
Jokes on you. I'm a locksmith. Not without hands. You're not

538
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,720
Oh

539
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:12,160
Dear you really want to do this. Oh, no, what am I going to do?

540
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,080
You have no

541
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,360
Oh

542
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,960
Now be good, okay, don't make don't do any funny ideas

543
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,080
Okay, don't do any funny ideas

544
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,800
I

545
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,440
Really will

546
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:10,560
I really will I've been so nice. I've been so nice. I gave you a home. I take you out for walks

547
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,200
Like what more do you want for me?

548
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,920
Okay

549
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,320
I

550
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:33,840
What do you want this this is the dream you're living with me. We're going to get married. We're gonna have three kids

551
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
Like what what more do you want?

552
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,960
Okay

553
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:51,440
So be good or I'll be very oh, you know, I'll be a little upset, you know

554
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,040
All right

555
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,560
Why just three well, I feel like they'll support each other very well

556
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,720
Oh

557
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,800
It's okay, I'll be the breadwinner

558
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,760
Sim

559
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,840
So we're all good

560
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,680
I'm winking but you guys can't see because I have a

561
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,280
Hey next question

562
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,640
Do you have any longtime girls as in girls girls? What's on my mind girls?

563
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
As a member of viola. Yes. I want to be here for a long time

564
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,360
So what I want is to do like 3d streams outfits

565
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,800
Um, continually, uh produce more content for all of you guys

566
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,760
and

567
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,880
And continue on on uh being a part of this company and hopefully

568
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,360
Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully have a bit of my dreams come true as well

569
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,160
And I want strong stream to come true. I think

570
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,960
I'm so thankful for straw knee

571
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,160
and

572
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,560
management and like basically every staff

573
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,960
That I get to be here. So I feel very thankful for that

574
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,520
And so I want to do my best in order to to give back

575
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,320
Their pay back their kindness

576
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,120
Have you seen

577
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,560
I've seen you wish for the sire fumo. Are you a visual fan of visual novels? Do you have favorite aroge? Yes

578
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,400
I love the show novels. Why because I can lay back and just go

579
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
So

580
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,680
So I like uh, so I like aroge. Um

581
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,720
The last

582
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,600
Aroge I played was gore screaming show and I really liked it

583
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,400
I really liked it. I thought it had layers like an onion. It had

584
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,960
Layers and I really liked it. Um

585
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,480
And another one that I really liked I do like saiyano uta

586
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:51,120
I I played saiyano uta when uh, I probably shouldn't have played saiyano

587
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,400
So I probably shouldn't have played that game at a certain age

588
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,920
Don't do that kids. Um

589
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,600
But I was enthralled by it. I was enthralled by the plot and everything. I loved it so much

590
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,480
So the last uh

591
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,440
Mercy did saiya do anything wrong? No, it was uh, what's his face the entire time?

592
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
She simply got corrupted my opinion

593
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:38,080
Hey garashi, I love you garashi too, but that's not at all. I think I like uh, what was the call again?

594
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:48,560
I answered this question already on on my twitter and on my moderals, but I can't remember

595
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
What was the name of it?

596
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:59,280
Oh, they translated it too much. How'd I know shoujo? How'd I know shoujo? I had fun. I had fun with that as well

597
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,080
um

598
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,080
Yeah

599
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:14,160
So I really like uh playing visual novels, especially kind of like darker visual novels

600
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:21,280
Uh that take a more grim look. I think another one that I recently played was oh shoot. What was it called?

601
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,760
It's a really old one. It's considered like, I believe it's one of the first

602
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,880
Eroge's to be like officially translated to a western market. What was it called again?

603
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,640
Divided. Yeah, I I recently played divided. You can actually play it for free now

604
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,440
It's like uh, I

605
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,000
Yeah, it's it's it's you can play it for free now. Mm-hmm

606
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,840
So I I really like uh playing a lot of games

607
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,880
Uh, especially if they're kind of like relaxing for me

608
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:59,360
Um, what I usually do if I stream visual novel games is I will voice the characters myself

609
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,200
Um, if the characters have voices, I try to mimic their voices

610
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,240
So I hope that's not too distracting, but that's what I'm gonna do and that's what you're gonna like senpai

611
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,080
What dead divided di vi dead

612
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:28,400
Yeah, but yeah, that's what you guys guys are gonna like that's what you're gonna take and I'm not gonna do it any other way if you're like

613
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:32,000
Oh, she's reading over the voices and I wanted to hear the voices. I don't care

614
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
Play it by yourself

615
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,280
Right now you're with me

616
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,200
All right

617
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,120
Amy said something about not

618
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,600
Having spicy accounts yet. Do you have a site in mind for it? Yes. I have a site in mind

619
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,680
Uh, I want to do the uh, what was it? Finsley?

620
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,880
So I want to do that especially for arrow gay

621
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,760
For arrow gay, I really like that and I had a

622
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,120
Good stamina for reading reading visual novels and gaming

623
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:20,720
So I think uh, we'll we'll play lots. We'll play lots. Uh, of course, I've asked management about it and I've asked Ronnie about it

624
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,040
and of course, it's uh, it's uh

625
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,160
We should probably establish

626
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,920
um

627
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:35,680
Establish ourselves on uh, youtube and and and as a content creator first before

628
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,360
Doing that. So I understand. So please wait patiently. Okay

629
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,080
Anything in real life now

630
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,080
I'm shy

631
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:54,720
I'm shy. No, really. I'm I'm super shy. Like I might seem outgoing now, but honestly, uh

632
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:01,600
I famously spent like entire week trying to talk to someone and then like I I took the the time to uh

633
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,240
Finally talk to a friend and I was like, ah

634
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
And I took me uh

635
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,960
Uh, hi

636
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:16,960
No hand cam, maybe that's the most you will get from me. It's maybe a hand cam

637
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,960
Maybe

638
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,960
It depends on how I feel

639
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,160
So

640
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,760
I'm like super shy. I'm like super super shy. No, seriously

641
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:40,480
Uh, I'm super I might seem outgoing. I might seem really ganky, but inside I'm internally screaming all the time

642
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,800
No, if you can no

643
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,800
Uh, no

644
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:51,520
I don't really know how that would be appealing and I haven't been creative enough to think about that

645
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,960
But no, no, I don't think so. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

646
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,680
I

647
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,280
May seem ganky, but I'm really stanky shut the fuck up ghoul

648
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,960
I introverted now

649
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,560
See the thing is I might I am extroverted

650
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,320
Because I always want to be around you senpai like I always want to be you guys

651
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:20,000
Uh always fill me up with such energy and it makes me feel really happy, but

652
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,400
I have introverted hobbies

653
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,760
So I don't make a lot of friends that easily with introverts or extroverts

654
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,280
Like I remember someone was like, oh

655
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,800
Do you want to go to a rave? No, I want to go home and watch the movies and stuff, you know, they're just like

656
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,240
Why are you so weird for not waiting to go to a rave and I'm like

657
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,560
So I've yeah

658
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,960
What movie

659
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,960
Probably at the time I wanted to watch uh

660
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,680
some kind of anime movie probably

661
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
Probably gentle cyber or something

662
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,160
So

663
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:32,000
Yeah, I would call myself an extrovert because I really do feel energy being around other people

664
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,560
um, but I would

665
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:40,400
Say that I appear more of an introvert and I have trouble talking to people because of

666
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:48,160
Like my hobbies are not exactly what standard extroverted people have as as as a hobby

667
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,520
What's your blood type? Why do you guys want to know my blood type?

668
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,800
So introverted extrovert something like that, I don't know I wouldn't put myself in a label too much because

669
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,520
Yeah, it just feels weird

670
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,320
I mean, I assume, you know, you know all our blood types, maybe

671
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,760
Maybe are you guys gonna do the the japanese blood type quiz on me? Want to see what my personality is?

672
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,120
I'll give you a hint about why my blood type is it's very common

673
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,640
The end

674
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,600
There you go

675
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,800
Have you played needy streamer overload? If so, what's your opinion on it? I played needy streamer overload

676
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,400
This is probably gonna be a little weird

677
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,200
Needy streamer overload is

678
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,840
Fun

679
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,040
I cannot listen to the soundtrack it hurts my ears. There's some kind of frequency in the game that makes me go

680
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,360
Oh, this fucking hurts

681
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,840
Out of this fucking hurts

682
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,360
Does that make sense

683
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,640
There's something in the soundtrack that i'm just like

684
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,000
I like literally rip my off my headphones and just go

685
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,560
So that's why I don't really

686
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:42,240
I'm not the biggest fan of needy streamer overload. I love its aesthetics. I love love the gameplay. I just

687
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,160
It hurts my ears

688
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,880
I don't know what frequency it is

689
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,320
I don't know what frequency it is

690
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:59,040
It feels like when you are a kid and you could hear them and if you could hear the mosquito

691
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,600
Sound or something and then it just means you have that like certain frequency that you can hear

692
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,200
It feels like that it hurts it hurts my ears. It physically hurts my ears

693
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,800
So that's why uh, I also hope that i'm that insane

694
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,960
You're welcome

695
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:30,180
Played on mute. Oh, but if I played on mute, it's boring. It's boring

696
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:40,240
I'm not your senpai because I'm probably younger than you and that would make me your coal hides over shut up

697
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:45,600
You guys are all my all senpais. Senpai's not age. Senpai's not a gender

698
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:53,760
Except for senpai if you're if you if you are under 18, maybe you shouldn't be here

699
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,840
This was sent by a 38 year old

700
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,720
Senpai

701
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,040
Is you and I love you

702
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,920
truly sincerely I do

703
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,160
I

704
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:19,600
believe senpai is a mentor type person and you guys are also mentoring me through my journey through asmr as well

705
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,720
That's why everyone is senpai and I'm coal hide only me

706
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,800
So

707
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:40,000
That's why I feel like my senpais are all you guys. I know that your fan names are

708
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,520
snippets but snippets but

709
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:50,720
You are all my senpais and you and if you guys don't really like senpai sometimes I'll I'll I'll switch between

710
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,200
Senpai and darling

711
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,240
Okay

712
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:01,760
Well, you still be coal hide if we all are gets our son second gen

713
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,760
If second gen happens and if it does

714
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,800
They are the only ones that get to call me senpai

715
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,760
understood

716
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,400
Duh

717
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:31,040
Mercy is there pet name you like to be called by I like any pet names honestly, uh when

718
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,160
Senpai started to call me coal hide. I felt I felt you know, I felt really happy

719
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:43,440
I felt really happy. I feel like that's our pet name. Um, I don't mind any pet name styling honey

720
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,680
Baby

721
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,240
Anything works

722
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,680
Okay

723
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,240
Um

724
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:08,400
Um sugar biscuit, I don't know I don't know

725
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,600
Snookums I'm I'm all for it. I'm all for it

726
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,920
I

727
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,080
Therefore

728
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,200
Even like sweetheart

729
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,880
Pumpkin things like that. I don't mind

730
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:43,680
I don't mind although I do have an affinity an affinity with coal hide right now. Okay

731
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,680
Hmm time for a simple question. What is your favorite food? Uh

732
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:00,640
Thing that can eat so if you watched my debut senpai, I have said that I am allergic to eggs and

733
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,280
That is a huge freaking problem. Everything contains eggs in it

734
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,720
So, uh, I'm not that picky. Um

735
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,280
I

736
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,040
Don't like porridge because

737
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,960
As a child, I was hospitalized a lot

738
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,320
And they would always give me porridge every single freaking day

739
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,280
Every single freaking meal

740
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,480
So it reminds me of when I'm sick. That's all

741
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,280
Oh

742
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:42,320
Sorry, I go crazy. I go crazy seeing like other other other girls

743
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,600
I go seeing other, uh, corporal girls

744
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,640
Hi

745
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,560
But okay, sorry, sorry, I got distracted. But yeah, I

746
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:12,240
Can't eat eggs and therefore I'm very allergic to it and anything that contains eggs. I cannot eat it. So that means

747
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,200
Uh cakes I have to eat vegan cakes. Um

748
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,640
A certain certain ice creams I can't eat ice cream unless it doesn't contain that

749
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,600
And

750
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,920
All that all that stuff. So I'm super allergic. Uh

751
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:39,040
Another part of my allergy that happens is that, uh, there's a lot of things a lot of things

752
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,600
such as vaccines and

753
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:47,040
Medicine that I can't take because of eggs as well. So that's why my immune system is a bit weak

754
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,840
It's always been a bit weak since I was a child

755
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,280
So that's that's how it is

756
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,240
So eggs is a big hate. I don't like the word eggs. I don't like smelling eggs

757
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:10,560
I don't like seeing eggs. So for maybe like, you know, and in an anime like, uh, shugo chara

758
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,280
shugo kara

759
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,760
Kara for my character. Yeah

760
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,120
Those are fine

761
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,880
So I have a

762
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,760
Yeah, uh, maybe like, yeah, yeah, yeah, like maybe Easter eggs and chocolate eggs fine

763
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,200
But like I don't like eggs periods not the smell not being around them

764
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,360
If I see the word eggs somewhere. I'm just don't

765
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,040
You know done

766
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:57,840
Hi, mercy are you into manga or video novels? Will you read some loon ones? Yes done. I answered that one

767
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,520
I'm sorry, I can't see this

768
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,840
I can't see this

769
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,400
It's too far away from me

770
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:21,040
Can I can I pull this up hold on let me pull this to a different screen

771
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,720
Okay, oh

772
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,320
Oh, hold on. I need to take off my eyepatch for this

773
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,720
Okay, um, what inspired you to be a vtuber? Honestly

774
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,480
When keys are not I said

775
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:04,560
Uh, did you help create the avatar? Absolutely not. Can you tell us something behind the scenes? I didn't even get to name

776
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,200
Oh

777
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:22,000
I feel so naked without my eyepatch, but I gotta see yeah favorite content creators that aren't vtubers

778
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,480
No next question

779
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,120
Uh, I guess like if

780
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,640
No, no next question. I can't think of anyone

781
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,480
If given a chance to collab with any vtuber, who would it be?

782
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,360
Anyone really

783
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,080
Anyone really it's just um

784
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,040
Excuse me

785
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,040
Oh, I know I know who

786
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,400
If I could stream Natalia Sana, I want to tell her I learned

787
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,240
I'm cold from her

788
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,920
Thanks for teaching me Japanese

789
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,360
Um

790
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,080
If you're a vtuber avatar came to life, what do you think I'll say about you?

791
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,120
Senpai is mine

792
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,520
Get the fuck away from me

793
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,560
What's wrong with you?

794
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:48,240
She probably roast me real me

795
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,960
Oop k-fave drop I need my eyepatch back on

796
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,120
Oh

797
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,200
I'll be a cat fight pretty much

798
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,960
Okay, let's see

799
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,960
Uh

800
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,120
Congrats on debut mercy, thank you

801
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,560
My question is in your opinion after working in violor for some time now

802
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:34,240
How would you describe their management also ignore the question if you don't want to answer?

803
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,080
I don't want to get you in trouble

804
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,880
Um, probably not gonna get in trouble probably not maybe a little spanking but nah

805
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,400
Spanking my scrawny honestly should probably

806
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,880
wouldn't care

807
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:49,920
but

808
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,200
Oh management is great. Honestly management is great. I do not respect management. Just kidding

809
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,040
Just kidding I'm kidding

810
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,040
Um

811
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:13,040
Management is actually very competent. They answer my questions quickly. Um, I get a lot more freedom than I thought I would

812
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,640
I get a lot of freedom than I thought I would um

813
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,880
Um

814
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:32,640
Usually I would ask a simple question and then I'll get back to me almost as soon as as soon as I can so

815
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,440
I think um

816
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,760
I think management's pretty good

817
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,320
pretty good

818
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,880
I think it's more funny is uh

819
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,760
What's funny is that I expected to be like

820
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:52,240
There's some things that that management does tell me no no not at this time no no no and I'm okay with that

821
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,240
but I expected kind of like a

822
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:02,080
Like a more strict type of management is very it's been very lax

823
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,880
kind of like you know

824
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,600
Instead of like your strict parents. It'll be like you're cool

825
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,920
Your cool aunt or your cool uncle that still has to take care of you

826
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,680
But they let you do more things that maybe your parents don't

827
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,280
Kind of things like that

828
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,960
They let's just say that they'll wrangle me when they need to

829
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,160
If I go

830
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,040
If I go balls to the walls and they'll and then management goes

831
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,040
Mmm

832
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:45,760
Your channel might get struck and now and then I'll be like fair fair kind of thing. Okay

833
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,600
Does that make sense the I'm probably

834
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,400
So things

835
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,080
Okay

836
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,120
So things like that would

837
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:14,720
Generally, I'd generally say that they're very good, but I I am a lot more freedom than I expected

838
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,600
Sometimes I get to know sometimes I get a maybe not this time

839
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,080
But overall it's been pretty respectful

840
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,960
Even though I will clown on management when I can

841
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:35,520
That's all push it to the limits. I don't want to push things to the limit because I have a high respect

842
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:41,440
For scrawny and I don't want scrawny mad or upset because um, I'm just that thankful

843
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,520
That's all

844
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,200
Okay, that's all the questions I had whoa

845
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,720
How long have I been screaming for?

846
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:05,840
Ah, I got time. I got lots of time. I have so much energy right now

847
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,120
Sometimes give me all the energy

848
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,960
You

849
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,200
Oops

850
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,240
My bad

851
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,120
Okay, yeah

852
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,280
I thought I had everything ready. I didn't

853
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,760
Was that in some music as well. Whoa. Okay. Wow. I thought I added that in I didn't wow

854
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,040
So there we go. Okay. Oh, what was it?

855
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:37,200
Yeah, I had like a little speech and then I saw I saw that there was no audio

856
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:50,480
I just noticed you I can see your ears through your bangs. Yeah, my my my bangs are pretty thin paper thin even

857
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,400
Okay, uh, what was I saying? Oh my gosh, uh, I had a little speech

858
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,280
I wanted to talk about a little bit of my v-tipping journey. I hope you guys don't mind

859
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,120
um

860
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,840
About basically like my journey to get here

861
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,880
Just so you guys can get to know me better a little bit

862
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,560
Excuse me

863
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,040
So

864
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,760
Um

865
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,760
I

866
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,680
Auditioned to a lot of companies

867
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,240
Some gave me some chances. Some didn't uh, I'd never made it

868
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,320
to

869
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,880
Never made it into a place before though

870
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:42,480
Um, I got lots of views on my videos on my auditions and stuff

871
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,920
but together, um, I

872
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,120
When I first started my journey

873
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,200
forgetting here

874
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,320
I

875
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:57,600
Had a daruma doll and I filled in one eye and I said I want to get into a v-tipping company

876
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:01,360
And when I do I'm going to fill in the other da the other eye

877
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:06,000
And I showed strongy my daruma doll

878
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,280
of uh

879
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:18,240
Of the eye filled in and I was really happy that I was able to finally fill it in after after so long

880
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,320
And I was really happy

881
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,440
I started this journey actually

882
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,000
with

883
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Serenity from vnu

884
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,600
Serenity and I worked very hard to achieve our dreams together

885
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,120
So I would consider serenity one of my best friends

886
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,920
And we cheered each other on all the time

887
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,880
So when she got into

888
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,120
vnu

889
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,760
I was very happy. I was cheering her on all the time

890
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So

891
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,720
When I got into v allure we kind of

892
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:13,440
Got together and was like we did it. We did it. We reached our dreams

893
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,400
So we reached our dreams together

894
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,360
And I feel very happy about that

895
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:32,560
Which is why if you guys were like, oh, why is serenity so into why was she so into this company? It's because

896
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,240
We are close friends. We are close friends

897
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,880
So we spent nights sometimes together, uh

898
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,120
Oh gosh, I'm tearing up now because I love her so much

899
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Um

900
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,480
We would spend some nights together reviewing our uh

901
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:08,320
Our audition videos with each other, um for companies and then we would uh

902
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,760
And then we could oh gosh

903
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,360
And

904
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:28,320
And we would talk about our dreams for hours and then you know, we would uh do calls together and stuff it was just it was just

905
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:30,880
It was just great

906
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,560
So when I got into the company and she got into the into a company

907
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:41,520
We were so happy for each other that we both reached our dreams finally because we both cheered each other on for so long

908
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,000
We both cheered each other for so long

909
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:56,720
And I'm so glad she fits perfectly in B&U and I feel like I fit perfectly in Bialore

910
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,920
So

911
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,360
She's my she's my best friend, uh

912
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:19,520
So she's my best friend and uh, she's been cheering me on

913
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:26,400
And she's like, I love you and then we go. I love you too. So we've been on this journey together for a while

914
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,480
I'll say some weird things too. It's it's it's weird

915
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:42,080
And I feel like I suit mercy perfectly and she suits serenity perfectly

916
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,080
Serenity perfectly

917
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:45,360
so

918
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,360
We are both very happy

919
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,880
We are both very happy that we achieved her dreams

920
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:05,680
And we're gonna keep doing it we're keep gonna we're just we're gonna keep going

921
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,920
So

922
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,800
We work so hard to get here

923
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,840
I asked serenity before stream can I tell the story and then she goes yeah, you can so I asked permission

924
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,480
Will you two have a collab duh we're gonna have a collab

925
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,280
Duh we're gonna have a collab

926
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:44,400
We're like really close friends and stuff so I can't wait. I can't wait. Um

927
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,800
Not not anything not anything um sassy though. It's gonna be like a normal collab. Sorry

928
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,920
So

929
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,480
I was so happy like

930
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:12,800
Strani, I might post it up later, but strani when she heard the story

931
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:16,160
Now I gotta cry again

932
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:25,440
She loved it so much she commissioned art of me and serenity and I was like

933
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:34,960
I'm gonna show up. She probably show it later, but strani did that and I was so touched by it

934
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,280
I

935
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,680
Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm crying

936
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,680
I

937
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:10,480
So I'm so happy to be here you guys don't know

938
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,360
A lot we worked to get here

939
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,840
I

940
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:23,200
Just why I'm gonna work really hard

941
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,800
To make strani proud and I'm gonna work really hard to make all my supplies really happy

942
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,800
It was funny because

943
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,960
I

944
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,960
My mom is my mom pulled me aside one day

945
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,480
And decided to read my fortune for no reason and I I was like, okay

946
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,560
So

947
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,720
It was like

948
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,360
You're going to get a job

949
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:12,960
And it was very specific it was like you're gonna get a job and a woman who

950
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:17,680
Where's a lot of black and maybe has black hair

951
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:23,040
Black hair and this is going to be a very strange a little bit of different work

952
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,600
But you're going to get a job. You're gonna

953
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:30,080
Be fulfilled and she's gonna help you get this job and she's gonna work and

954
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:34,000
Make your dream and help you reach your goals and I was like, oh

955
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,600
At the time I didn't think anything of it

956
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:41,760
And now I feel like you know the woman that that mama

957
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,480
Mama said was uh

958
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,560
Was uh was strani

959
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,200
So I'm really happy. Sorry teary up

960
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:09,200
So I'm really happy to be here like truly

961
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I

962
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:28,080
Really love it here. Uh, okay. Let's let's move on to like a funnier story. Okay

963
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,360
Let's let's move on to a funnier story

964
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,600
I

965
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,840
I'm still gonna cry. Okay. I'm sorry

966
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:51,760
I did not get the email for joining me or until several days after after they ended

967
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,320
So I thought oh, okay

968
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,880
I thought I didn't get it

969
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,320
I

970
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,960
I thought I didn't get in

971
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:17,680
I thought I didn't get in and so I know it's it's rude manners

972
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,520
But I was like, okay. Well

973
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:26,720
Whatever they might not respond to me, but here we go. I'll send an email asking for some feedback

974
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,080
I send an email

975
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:34,000
Getting for some feedback then I was like, okay, whatever. I gotta move on

976
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:43,520
I gotta move on then I get a message a few days later saying oh fucking shit

977
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,040
Oh you got in

978
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I want

979
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,840
And I got

980
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,560
But like I was really into

981
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,720
um

982
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,320
Into violor

983
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:09,680
So I was like, oh well, you know, I didn't get in but I'm going to support the company because I think I really believe in

984
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:12,560
scrawny stream. I really believe in scrawny stream. So I

985
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:19,520
I started uh doing uh some things where I was like, okay. I want to like, you know promote them a little bit, you know

986
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,480
uh

987
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:28,880
So I got pulled into an emergency call basically like my sign

988
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,800
Gave me the basic rundown and everything and

989
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,200
And uh

990
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:44,480
I got in I got in it was I got a bit of a different

991
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:48,640
I'm not sure about the interview process for the other girls, but mine was a little rushed

992
01:46:48,800 --> 01:47:01,600
I got in a little later than the rest of the girls because well, I

993
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,840
So

994
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,840
I was like, oh my god

995
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:24,160
I was flabbergasted actually I screamed so hard when I got the emails saying like, you know

996
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,120
They they want to talk they want to talk to me

997
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
and um

998
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,240
I screamed so hard. So when I got onto the call the scrawny

999
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,120
Uh to to kind of do my interview. I was like

1000
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:42,720
The entire time that one was real, but I'm using it as emphasis

1001
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,320

1167
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:09,440
It's alt fan art with faceless mail. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. If you have any more questions. I saw my twitter my alternate twitter

1168
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,880
How far retro are you talking?

1169
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:20,560
I may play like I don't know. I don't know whatever I feel like honestly

1170
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:30,880
I still have to set it all up though. So there's no promises but

1171
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:33,600
In my mind in my mind

1172
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:40,400
I want to build up my tolerance for 3d games by playing older 3d games in order to kind of build up

1173
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,200
You know a tolerance

1174
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,480
Um

1175
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:51,040
I have to set it up. Oh, sorry

1176
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:56,960
I turned a little bit because I went to look at the crt that's still over there. I have actually have two crt's

1177
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:02,720
Because I wasn't sure if the one I currently have is too big. So I have a smaller one as well

1178
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,960
Okay, I just didn't want to play oh

1179
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,960
I

1180
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,760
Did you know a devil saga?

1181
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,040
Oh

1182
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,040
What else do I have?

1183
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:28,480
There's this one kind of like western kind of rpg. I thought was cool as well. I also have that

1184
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:36,080
Uh, I have

1185
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:42,240
What wait, wait, wait, I remember the name of the rpg wild arms. Yeah, I have wild arms

1186
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:51,120
Yeah wild arms. Oh, you guys really really read my mind. I was like oh, I get a little western rpg

1187
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:55,280
And I was like, well listen, I had to turn around physically to take a look at it

1188
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,320
Like I wanted to play that

1189
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:05,120
I don't have good vision

1190
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:09,440
Our our the arse our series

1191
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:16,160
Our tour isn't my best. I'm a little something. Uh, maybe some atelier games

1192
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:21,120
Atelier games will be fine. Um

1193
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:29,120
You drink coffee. Uh, no, I don't drink coffee. In fact, I'm drinking tea right now

1194
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:38,640
I

1195
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:44,000
Kind of see oh shoot, I don't remember

1196
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:51,360
Oh

1197
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,800
I don't know what

1198
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:08,240
Is it echinacea it might be echinacea

1199
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:17,440
You came with playing third person games sometimes it depends really depends

1200
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,960
It might be echinacea. Yeah

1201
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,840
Oh

1202
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:35,760
That's worrying what kind of tea I drink, uh, I just put one in I have like a whole pile

1203
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:43,200
One of your plans for youtube membership streams probably a lot of asmr streams, um

1204
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:45,280
Doodling streams, maybe

1205
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:49,680
What's your favorite type of tea? Uh, the current tea I like is right now peppermint vanilla

1206
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:58,240
We play through higurashi uminickle. I played higurashi the first chapter. Yes, I play the first chapter

1207
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,800
What asmr mic do you have? Oh

1208
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:09,600
Strani if you were paying attention to strani strani and

1209
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:13,040
Management vlr has provided me with a three deal

1210
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:29,600
A three deal I've got the uh, the one

1211
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:34,720
XLR the ones where you can put in XLR cables. Yeah

1212
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:39,680
She also, uh, provided, uh, vlr

1213
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,880
Also, well, it's not really her. It was management. Uh, provided me a

1214
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:49,600
Interface as well to work with the

1215
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:52,640
radio

1216
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:58,480
So I'm able to

1217
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:01,040
to strain at my

1218
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:03,200
Peak at my peak

1219
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:08,560
Three deal free space XLR. Thank you. Yeah, that one

1220
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,800
It's a little

1221
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,520
a little, um

1222
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:22,000
Sensitive I found out it's because when I was doing some recording sometimes my stomach would rumble and it goes

1223
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,400
Grrr, and you would hear and they're recording. I was like, oh

1224
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:29,280
I kind of interfered

1225
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:32,240
I kind of interface us

1226
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,640
Scarlett, what was it again?

1227
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,520
Management, I know you're here

1228
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,960
Scarlett

1229
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:46,640
Maybe

1230
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,800
You

1231
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,880
That one

1232
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:03,840
First gen focus right to i2. There you go. Thank you, my nice son

1233
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:11,120
So I have that uh, I'm still kind of getting used to the three deal

1234
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:15,440
I probably won't use it like a regular person would because I don't

1235
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:23,680
I'm very ignorant of asmr stuff. So for triggers and stuff. I'm thinking about getting some things some some beauty

1236
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:26,240
beauty beauty

1237
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:27,360
tools

1238
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:34,480
And trying them out on the three deal. I'm thinking about that. I still gotta go out and get them at like a discount shop

1239
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,880
Are all asmr is gonna be spicy. Yes and no

1240
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:44,480
Some will be spicy some will not be spicy

1241
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:50,080
But I'm we're probably gonna play it safe and the spicy ones will be on patreon. Sorry

1242
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,320
Seems you're interested in a bunch of suit of 51 games to see your favorite not necessarily

1243
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:04,960
I just happen to be interested in like kind of

1244
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,760
experimental games

1245
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:16,640
Can you give us a hint on the asmr themes?

1246
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:18,720
um

1247
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:22,240
I haven't thought about it that far yet to be honest

1248
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:27,440
I haven't thought about it from that far yet

1249
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:33,600
Thank you for the tippy wippy

1250
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:40,640
Hands i'm playing no more heroes. I want to play no more heroes on the Wii

1251
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:46,160
I heard that you can pick up the phone on the Wii remote and then the sound comes out of the Wii remote like the

1252
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:47,120
Like a phone

1253
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:51,520
So I want to play you like that and I found and then apparently you can jork it you can jork the

1254
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:55,120
The the Wii remote. I want to try it with the Wii

1255
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:05,760
Johnny said equipment purchases are still going to come out of your future patrex though. Is that true? Yes

1256
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:10,160
Only a part of it though. So it's easier

1257
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:26,560
So it's easier so the cost of it is a little bit more down. Don't worry about it

1258
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:36,320
Any interest in deadly premonitions or swearee games? Okay

1259
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:41,680
Hey, I have oh my gosh. I my model's lagging. Oh, no

1260
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:46,320
Uh, uh stop lagging you there you go

1261
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:53,120
Daily premonitions, no probably not

1262
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:58,960
Do you know why because I tried to play deadly premonition premonition and then uh on PC

1263
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:03,280
and then I set stop and everything and it froze

1264
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:04,960
at

1265
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:08,000
I could not take out the screwdriver out of

1266
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:14,640
The toolbox and then I went onto the forms and and google this and do you know what google said?

1267
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,640
And I said how do I play this on PC know what I've said buy it on switch

1268
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:34,320
Buy it on switch. It is an unplayable in PC form. So most likely I'm probably not gonna play

1269
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:37,360
Because I don't want to buy another game again

1270
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:44,320
So I don't want to go through that, you know

1271
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:49,840
I don't want to go through that. Yeah, I don't

1272
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:53,520
I don't want to

1273
02:12:55,120 --> 02:13:00,960
Yeah, pretty much it literally said how do I play it on PC? You don't I was like, how do I improve? How do I uh

1274
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:08,480
Is there any any I don't know patches in order to to optimize the game and they said you want to play deadly premonition on PC

1275
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:11,280
Buy it on switch

1276
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:13,280
So

1277
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:28,640
So no, I don't think so no until I get over my piss until I get over my anger about the PC part

1278
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:38,320
Feelings on ps2 era horror like rule of rules. I never grew up on

1279
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:43,040
On that type of game. I never got to play games. My first console was

1280
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:47,840
a the ds lite so uh take that as you will my first

1281
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:54,000
Home console was a ps4. So also take that as you will

1282
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:01,280
I never got to experience the games that you guys played

1283
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:13,840
So I'm excited to try out games that I've never tried before as well

1284
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:17,920
I know like a lot of girls really love the retro games. I kind of don't want to step on their toes

1285
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,920
but at the same time just kind of like

1286
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:22,080
I want to play

1287
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:23,280
older

1288
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:24,560
jb

1289
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:25,840
RPG

1290
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,640
Maybe visual novel type games. Can I do that?

1291
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:31,200
Am I gonna step on any toes?

1292
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,800
Any games in mind as I said

1293
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:43,840
as I said, um probably digital devil saga atelier series

1294
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:46,560
wild arms are whatever

1295
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,040
That word was

1296
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:51,920
So

1297
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:56,400
Yeah, those are the type of games that I want to try

1298
02:14:57,200 --> 02:15:02,560
As well and I want to play no more heroes specifically on the Wii because I want to draw. I want to draw the remote

1299
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:08,560
Have you ever played or

1300
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:12,240
Wanna leak leak leak. Oh, is that what it's called? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh

1301
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,360
No

1302
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,520
I have it

1303
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:31,920
But yeah, I love I love those

1304
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:36,160
I love those up any plans to playing

1305
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:40,720
Uh, what was it doki doki literature club? Maybe

1306
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:44,960
Maybe

1307
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:48,560
It's a big maybe mostly because I already played

1308
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:54,000
It already and I'm I remember I it's still fresh in my mind

1309
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:58,480
So I kind of want to play games that are either not that fresh in my mind yet or

1310
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,680
Kind of something that I haven't really played

1311
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:11,680
So I would really do you like platformer games. I'm really bad at platformers

1312
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:15,440
Uh, I don't have but I I do like playing them

1313
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:20,400
I want to play uh some mario games as well some some mario games

1314
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:25,120
I actually got my hands on mario like the remake of mario rpg

1315
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:29,440
But I'd really like to try that out as well. I know it's the remake. It's not like the real deal

1316
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,080
But I I have it in order to experience it for the first time

1317
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:44,240
So I really for the DS games I have tons of games that I played on the DS. I have such fond memories of them

1318
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,360
I don't have a DS that I can stream from though, so

1319
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:53,040
I cannot stream DS games

1320
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:59,440
Thousand Year Door is fantastic if you haven't played it. I played Thousand Year Door on the GameCube

1321
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,280
I managed to borrow GameCube from a friend and

1322
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:06,640
I played it. I played the whole thing

1323
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,200
I

1324
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:17,760
I wasn't expecting to see harvester on someone's schedule. Oh

1325
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:25,920
Okay, this is gonna sound weird, but I learned of harvester. I know of harvester and I played a bit of harvester

1326
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:29,360
in university

1327
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:32,160
In

1328
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,160
uh, we were playing a bunch of

1329
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:37,840
uh, games so the first game that I played in a

Seventh guest

1334
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,200
So

I played seventh guest and oh my gosh, I found out the one

1336
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:12,960
Game the the the virus game was based off of your clock. So when I was trying to play it, it was it's rough

1337
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,200
It was rough

1338
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:18,320
That's a course of course

1339
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:22,080
Of course

1340
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:30,160
