Being a VTuber must be so easy.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,540
WRONG!

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,080
It might look fine on the surface, but I assure you, everything can, and will go wrong at one point.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,460
1. Your model tracking can glitch out.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,500
2. Your audio can break overnight, even though you haven't changed a single setting from the last time you stream.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,000
3. Your PC can and will randomly bug you to update in the middle of an emotional scene in the video game.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,880
4. Your internet provider will decide that right before you stream to die and offer you a tiddly wink of bandwidth,

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
even though you pay premium rates.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,760
5. Your audience won't be notified of the things you're up to.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,200
Aw, thanks to the algorithm game on social media!

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,960
So you constantly get people confused when you reference an older stream that they have no idea about.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,600
Should I keep going because I can complain all night long, Senpai?
