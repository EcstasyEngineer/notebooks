00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,140
Music

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,080
Music

3
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:04,080
The

4
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:33,880
No, no, no, you can't get out of the cage.

5
00:06:33,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Oh, you noticed, I cut out your vocal cords so you can't talk, only wimper and mew like a pet.

6
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:18,880
And all good pets needs a very cute collar.

7
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Now that looks really cute on you.

8
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:36,880
You must be hungry.

9
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Don't worry, there's some water for you.

10
00:07:47,880 --> 00:08:09,880
Drink up, that's right. Good pet.

11
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Let's move this aside.

12
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,880
There's your kibble.

13
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Are you hungry?

14
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Make sure you eat this too, because it'll be the only meal you get in a while.

15
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Is it good? Just not.

16
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,880
You know, it took a while for me to actually get you.

17
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:17,880
It was really foolish of you to walk into that alley, but now you're here.

18
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Oh, don't try to defy me.

19
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Be a good pet. I got toys for you.

20
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:48,880
You like little toys, don't you?

21
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:59,880
It's a little squeaky toy. I'm sure you'll like it.

22
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:10,880
The cage is a little small, so why don't you just play with it in your cage?

23
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I've got more for you, but let's groom you a little bit.

24
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:48,880
There's a good pet.

25
00:10:48,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Oh, nice and grimped. Just like you like it. Like a good little pet.

26
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Don't worry, I've got more toys for you. Just be good.

27
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Don't stare at me like that.

28
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Well, it won't take nicely to that.

29
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Well, would you like your other toys?

30
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:56,880
I hear little doggies love this toy.

31
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Maybe you'll like two of them.

32
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Sorry, the spooked you didn't die.

33
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Nobody. Otherwise you'll get the muzzle.

34
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:40,880
No one wants that, right?

35
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,880
It's not your average muzzle.

36
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Let's just say it's a contraption I made myself.

37
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:06,880
We'll just have to remove all of your teeth first.

38
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Unfortunately, I don't have anything to numb the pain.

39
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:28,880
So be good. No biting, okay? No biting.

40
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Why don't you just enjoy your food? You like that, don't you?

41
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:52,880
It's just kibble.

42
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Oh, picky eaters.

43
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:26,880
We'll have to teach picky eaters a lesson.

44
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Eat up.

45
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:48,880
Good.

46
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Good, good. Yum, yum. Eat it all up.

47
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:02,880
It's your favorite.

48
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Yum, yum.

49
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:23,880
I also bought a new toy for you, too.

50
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Doesn't that sound nice? It's a cat toy, even though you're a little pup.

51
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:59,880
You like that? You like the sound?

52
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:27,880
It doesn't matter what type of pet you are. You're my pet, and that's all that matters.

53
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:54,880
This is your leash. Nice and strong.

54
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Nice and strong. Don't pull too hard. You'll hurt yourself.

55
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Good, good.

56
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Uh-uh. No talking.

57
00:17:46,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Pets only whimper, mew, maybe bark. But you're good, right?

58
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Maybe you want your little toy again.

59
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:57,880
It's such a cute little toy. It's a squeaky toy. I bought it just for you.

60
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Waiting for this day.

61
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Can you fetch? Can you?

62
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:36,880
There you go. Go catch it.

63
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Aw, you're so good.

64
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Good job. I'm so proud of you. What a good pet.

65
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Here, just for you. Some ear scritches.

66
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Yes, who's a good pet? You are. You are such a good pet.

67
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Good. Now relax.

68
00:20:47,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Don't worry, you're safe. For now, I've always been watching you, my dear little pet.

69
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:38,880
I'm sure you're wondering, or many races are passing your mind. But just know you're here now, and you'll always be here, forever and ever.

70
00:21:38,880 --> 00:22:02,880
You are a good pet. It's just you still have a little defiance in you. We'll fix that soon, don't worry. I have to make you comfortable for now.

71
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:25,880
We'll have your walkies and your late night walks in the park for fun, of course.

72
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:51,880
But if you run, I guess I'll have to put you down. Understood?

73
00:22:51,880 --> 00:23:13,880
Don't run, or cry for help. Well, not that you can. I've already ripped out your throat. Well, your vocal cords, not really your throat. It's a hard, hard, hard, hard process, but we made it work.

74
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Oh, don't worry about that. Semantics, don't worry about it. Are you still hungry? No.

75
00:23:44,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Do you still want food? Should I take the food out from your cage?

76
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:38,880
That's your delicious kibble. Eat up.

77
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:48,880
You're such a messy eater.

78
00:24:48,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Well? Let's have some water.

79
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Good pet. You're so good.

80
00:25:49,880 --> 00:26:14,880
I think your training is going really well, don't you think?

81
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Good. Remember, you're a little pet. Nothing more. You'll listen to your master and obey everything I say.

82
00:26:36,880 --> 00:27:04,880
When I say jump, you'll start jumping since you can't ask how high. If I ask you to lay down and roll, you'll do it.

83
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:35,880
Little pets. This is your number one happiness now. When I come home, you'll be waiting at the door for me. And in exchange, well, I'll give you lots and lots of love.

84
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Every day, for the rest of your life, you can't even go away. If you run, I'll just find you again.

85
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:26,880
I may have done a little few more surgeries on you. More than just your vocal cords.

86
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Oh, you're curious?

87
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:51,880
I just put a little chip in you, silly. A little tracker. Where? Well...

88
00:28:51,880 --> 00:29:13,880
I wouldn't want you to do anything dangerous. So that's a secret. Shhh. Between me, myself, and I.

89
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:27,880
You should be happy. You should be happy. After all, I'm being a good owner. I'm being a good master.

90
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:51,880
I'll take care of you. I'll groom you, train you, and all for naught. All you have to do is be good.

91
00:29:51,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Now you're really understanding the situation you're in.

92
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Nice little headpats.

93
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

94
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:09,880
I got two of these for you.

95
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:22,880
I figured you'd like something like crinkles.

96
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Little crinkle toys. Little pets love these, especially dogs. It gives that little textile feel.

97
00:31:41,880 --> 00:32:05,880
It has a squeaker inside, but the squeaker's a little loud, so I got you a different one.

98
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm sure you like this sound, right?

99
00:32:35,880 --> 00:33:04,880
I spent lots of money for you at the pet shop. In fact, they've noticed that I've come by so often they asked me if I wanted a rewards card. Maybe I should. Just for you.

100
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:32,880
I think this one's cute and soft. I picked it out for you.

101
00:33:32,880 --> 00:34:01,880
It's cute.

102
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:27,880
This one makes an interesting sound. I picked it. I thought you'd like something like this.

103
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I'm glad. I'm glad.

104
00:34:48,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Honestly, I picked a variety of pet toys. It doesn't matter what kind of pet you are as long as you're my pet.

105
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:42,880
Repeat after me. In your mind it's just fine.

106
00:35:43,880 --> 00:36:11,880
I'm Mercy's pet. I love my master. I come running anytime my master is home. All I can think about is my master.

107
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Memorize that. Good. Training is going so well. It's going so very well.

108
00:36:37,880 --> 00:37:06,880
I'm so glad that you've come too and come around to it so quickly.

109
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:16,880
You're so good. So good.

110
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Wag your little tail. Pet and hang out your tongue. Laugh up the food I give you.

111
00:37:36,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Because all of it is love. After all you love me and I love you. I'm going to make you the perfect pet.

112
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:24,880
A perfect little pet. One who sparks joy. Who jumps up and down for their master. You're good, right?

113
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Go on. Roll over. You know what to do.

114
00:38:46,880 --> 00:39:01,880
Roll over. Beg.

115
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:27,880
So good. Beg. Put your little arms up. Start panting. Beg for a treat.

116
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:51,880
And I might just give you it.

117
00:39:51,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Good pet. There's your little treat. Aren't you happy now?

118
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:42,880
If you're not satisfied. Maybe I can give you a little small treat. Maybe some food again.

119
00:40:42,880 --> 00:41:04,880
Are you happy? You can nod. Or shake your head. Although I'll be a little disappointed if you shake your head.

120
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Good job. Good job. I love you so much. I love you.

121
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:24,880
There you go. Good. Good. Good.

122
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:45,880
You're doing fantastic for your training. Who's a good pet? You are. You're such a good pet.

123
00:41:45,880 --> 00:42:04,880
And to think you lived your life without me. You lived your life without me. But now I'm here.

124
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:24,880
And you won't ever leave me ever again.

125
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:48,880
You are so good. There's still some things I want to fix though. But we'll leave it for later.

126
00:42:48,880 --> 00:43:13,880
Trust me. We'll wait a little longer. Now then. Would you like brushes? Or would you like to play with your toys again?

127
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:24,880
Brushes? Toys? You want brushes? Alright.

128
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:55,880
You like being groomed, don't you? What a spoiled pet.

129
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:36,880
But it's okay. I'll spoil you because I love you. I love you so very, very much.

130
00:44:36,880 --> 00:45:05,880
I'm surprised that you've accepted me so easily. I've honestly thought that you put a little bit more resistance.

131
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:22,880
And there was some things that I would have had to fix much faster.

132
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:49,880
They're all groomed. Nice and pretty. I want to show you off so badly. But we can't have other people meddling.

133
00:45:49,880 --> 00:46:11,880
Meddling would cause more questions than men. I might have to do some drastic measures. How do you like your collar? Do you want it off?

134
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:37,880
I bought it especially for you in mind. It looks good on you. A little tight, but I kind of want you to feel a little uncomfortable.

135
00:46:42,880 --> 00:47:00,880
I want you to feel a little uncomfortable.

136
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:23,880
Just to remind you. Exactly. Just to remind you of who you belong to. Who do you belong to? Pet.

137
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,880
Who do you belong to?

138
00:47:37,880 --> 00:48:06,880
Mercy? Good. I'm so proud of you. Good little pets. You're so good.

139
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:30,880
I'm glad this conditioning is working on you just wonderfully.

140
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:40,880
You're not defiant anymore, right?

141
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:57,880
I think I still see a little defiance. I think I should condition you a little more.

142
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:39,880
Go on.

143
00:49:39,880 --> 00:50:08,880
My mind is numb. All you can think about is me. All you can think about is your pet life.

144
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:36,880
You're so good. Kidnapping you was the best thing that ever happened to you.

145
00:50:39,880 --> 00:51:08,880
I've been watching you. Making sure you've fallen into my trap. Making sure that you have nothing else but me on your mind.

146
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:29,880
Wasn't it wonderful? You nearly screamed, but I caught you off guard. And then I dragged you back to my home.

147
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:58,880
Then I knocked you out. We needed some procedures done.

148
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:26,880
First, I took away your vocal cords because you can't scream for help. I've soundproofed the walls, but we can't have you trying to escape.

149
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:46,880
Next, I changed you down. At your feet.

150
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,880
Cute, right?

151
00:52:49,880 --> 00:53:06,880
Little chain. I made sure it was unbreakable.

152
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:23,880
I see it in your eyes. You want to confess your love to me, but you can't. That's okay. All you have to do is obey me. That's all you have to do.

153
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:33,880
Obey your master. Obey the love of your life.

154
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:45,880
Never try to escape. Never want to leave. And then, perhaps, that's how you say, I love you.

155
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
You're so good.

156
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,880
More toys.

157
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:31,880
Did you like the cat toy? The squeaky toy? The crinkly toy? Go on. You may point to whatever you want to play with.

158
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:56,880
The cat toy? The cat and crinkly toy. Maybe I'll spoil you a little, or maybe it will be too much. Perhaps a little much at the same time.

159
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:27,880
Good pet. I love you.

160
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:56,880
I wish I could have gotten you more toys, but pet toys are a little expensive, so you just have to wait. It can be a little gift from me to you.

161
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:16,880
I've worked so hard to get you here, so this is my reward.

162
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:29,880
You can choose your next one.

163
00:56:46,880 --> 00:57:04,880
Then you want the crinkly toy next?

164
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,880
Can we please get the squeaky one back?

165
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:23,880
Have you seen some of you really like the squeaker?

166
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:38,880
Every time I'll make you my perfect pet.

167
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:08,880
The shop.

168
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:23,880
But I was a little crazy trying to pick out one that had a good squeak.

169
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:52,880
I said it had to be perfect for my pet. They're very sensitive.

170
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:17,880
I think I picked a cute one. You seem to like it. You seem to like it a lot, actually. I'm so glad.

171
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:32,880
I didn't know if you'd like it. I had to experiment.

172
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:37,880
That's your little cage. Do you like it, your little cage?

173
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:52,880
I picked it out for you. Can I feed you? Of course I can.

174
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:36,880
That's your food.

175
01:02:37,880 --> 01:03:03,880
That's your little cage.

176
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:32,880
Good. Don't forget your water.

177
01:03:33,880 --> 01:04:02,880
Oh, sorry.

178
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:31,880
I had to remind you you were in a cage, of course.

179
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:57,880
I'm happy you're at home. That you won't be getting out of. Not without proper supervision.

180
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:12,880
By me, of course. You can have your walks. You can have fresh air.

181
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:41,880
You can get a little exercising.

182
01:05:42,880 --> 01:06:09,880
Can't we go get a pizza? Absolutely not.

183
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Stretch your legs? Oh, that's one of the things I wanted to fix. I can't help you running away now.

184
01:06:32,880 --> 01:07:01,880
Don't worry, you won't be immobile or anything. I'll think of something for you. Perhaps some wheels?

185
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:19,880
As I said, few things to make you my perfect pet.

186
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:32,880
Oh, you're struggling stop. Not yet.

187
01:07:32,880 --> 01:08:01,880
I'll wait a little bit before we start the operation again. Aren't you excited?

188
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:26,880
Then, only then will you actually fully be mine. I can carve your name. I can carve my name.

189
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:55,880
In a little bit longer. Just wait. You can't wait, can you? I know. Being with me forever. That's a dream, isn't it? That's what you've always wanted. I can see it in your eyes.

190
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:25,880
This is what you've always wanted. You don't need anything else but me. I'll provide you everything. There's nothing more you could want.

191
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:55,880
I'll feed you, bathe you, and give you lots of love. Just be good. Listen to me. I'll pay all my orders. That's all you need.

192
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:10,880
You don't want anything else. If you do, I can provide.

193
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:55,880
I'm so happy you're here. I hope you're happy too. I bet you are.

194
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:15,880
The cage is there. You can't get out. I told you. It's not going to be possible to get out. Not unless I take you out myself.

195
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:52,880
Getting out? Are you thinking about getting out? You better not be. I've been so good to you. Why would you want to leave?

196
01:11:52,880 --> 01:12:08,880
You're not going to leave, are you? You know what happens when you try to leave.

197
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:40,880
I'll have to put you down. And nobody wants that. Nobody wants to be put down.

198
01:12:52,880 --> 01:13:21,880
If you want to leave, you have to leave everything behind. Everything. Your heart beat.

199
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:50,880
Your breath. Everything.

200
01:13:52,880 --> 01:14:17,880
That's good. You're happy. That's all I want.

201
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:46,880
You want the kibble again? So needy.

202
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:57,880
All right.

203
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:27,880
All right.

204
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:57,880
All right.

205
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:27,880
Satisfied?

206
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:57,880
Satisfied?

207
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:32,880
Satisfied?

208
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:42,880
Of course a kiss.

209
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:59,880
Now, are you happy? Good. You're so happy.

210
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:20,880
I'm sorry that I can't play with you a little longer. I have some things to do. Is that okay?

211
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:36,880
As long as you're happy.

212
01:18:36,880 --> 01:19:05,880
I apologize. I'll be back soon. If you like this, let me know. You can leave a comment or a like. And of course, don't forget to subscribe.

213
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:17,880
Any lullabies before I go?

214
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:33,880
Ah, yes. The likes and soupas. Give me a second.

215
01:19:33,880 --> 01:20:01,880
Thank you for the $1 tip, Miss Morrigan. As soon as I saw what the stream was, I went and put my collar on. I was so glad to have you as an owner. I hope I was a good pet for you, a good girl. You are. You are. Don't worry. Thank you.

216
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:11,880
Thank you once again, Miss Morrigan, for the late.

217
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:31,880
You pour your into pet space so quickly, having my own collar with the bell on it made for just an immersive experience. I'm glad I got you your own collar in case you didn't.

218
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:59,880
Thank you for the $2 tip, Eileen. I'm genuinely considering adding a collar to my next Amazon order. It happened for the last week. Never had those thoughts before. This is your fault.

219
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:12,880
I hope you like being in control. I'm your master after all.

220
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,880
Thank you, Logan.

221
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:25,880
Serna, for the $10 super chat. I love Mercy. I love you too.

222
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:48,880
Thank you for the tip, $3 33 tip, Zyron. Absolute cinema. I'm glad I worked so hard to capture you and be my perfect little pet.

223
01:21:48,880 --> 01:22:05,880
Thank you for the $2 super chat, Charlie. Go high. I came. Can I come out? I gotta go potty real bad. There's a little puppy pad in there. Go ahead. I'll clean it up.

224
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:33,880
Thank you for the $2 super chats. He's subtle. Good stuff. Go high. Got really into it. I'm glad.

225
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:47,880
Thank you for the $5 tip, Senpai. Folks, it happened. Now we are in the Discord kitten. I'm so glad after I've groomed you.

226
01:22:47,880 --> 01:23:05,880
Thank you for the $690, Nicholas. Thank you for spending time with us and for the lovely stream. Please take care and have a fantastic evening. Thank you so much. I think I'll go rest.

227
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:31,880
But, as I said, Senpai, I had one more little surprise for you. Stay still, okay? This will only hurt for just a second.

228
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,880
