08:30.000 --> 08:57.680
it's always one heartbreak after another there are people who just love the

08:57.680 --> 09:02.640
drama of relationship but I don't think anyone specifically pines for heartbreak

09:02.640 --> 09:10.120
I mean I always give my best I try to be more than fair as a girlfriend but

09:10.120 --> 09:15.800
sometimes I get nit thinking that somehow it's all my fault I just can't

09:15.800 --> 09:20.160
wrap my head around how that could be possible it's times like this where I

09:20.160 --> 09:25.640
try to think back to the start of my love life starting with my first love and

09:25.640 --> 09:33.560
first loss maybe try to compare and see where I went wrong this time it started

09:33.560 --> 09:38.040
back in early college I was studying to become a fashion designer if you can

09:38.040 --> 09:45.920
believe that I wasn't as well deliciously brazen in my outfit choices as I am now

09:45.920 --> 09:51.920
a quiet much too overlooked girl who never got invited to parties their loss

09:51.920 --> 09:57.320
though I imagine I had more fun sewing crafting and anything else a grandma

09:57.320 --> 10:03.120
would do with spare time an old soul people would call me I was content in

10:03.120 --> 10:11.920
my own quiet that was until I met my first love I don't know what he saw in

10:11.920 --> 10:16.720
me but he was the one to make the first move even before I had the mind

10:16.720 --> 10:21.960
to dress to attract the male gaze here I was more of an all-miss chic ghost

10:21.960 --> 10:29.040
whatever the reason here was a man who takes charge where he needs to he was

10:29.040 --> 10:35.320
a dirty rabid-looking man who stank of booze and ooze failure and degeneracy in

10:35.320 --> 10:39.920
retrospect in our first meeting it was a bit more pushy than I'm used to

10:39.920 --> 10:44.800
nowadays it's best to understand that the pillar of a strong relationship is

10:44.800 --> 10:49.720
setting up boundaries and it's best to do it as soon as possible putting your

10:49.720 --> 10:54.520
foot down telling your partner what's what it's a risk you have to take it was

10:54.520 --> 11:00.560
because of that I remember that I always keep my fabric scissors with me when

11:00.560 --> 11:05.560
you interact with your partner honestly if the love is true they can feel your

11:05.560 --> 11:11.920
intent that's when the honest purest part of them comes out my favorite stage

11:11.920 --> 11:17.400
in all of my relationships it was like he was a completely different person

11:17.400 --> 11:22.560
from his introduction he showed me his true self a part men are taught to hide

11:22.560 --> 11:29.440
away the soft sweet vulnerable man inside I mean how could I not fall for him I

11:29.440 --> 11:34.540
don't think I have a particular type per se but a man who expresses his

11:34.540 --> 11:39.320
emotions in such a delicious way that's something I couldn't resist I just had

11:39.360 --> 11:44.920
to have him I had brought him to an old shed my family owns the best I could do

11:44.920 --> 11:51.040
at the time but together our love can make it all you see good relationships

11:51.040 --> 11:57.840
are built on compromise and I and compromise I did I gave that man

11:57.840 --> 12:04.120
everything everything you could ever want I bathed him fed him cared for him

12:04.240 --> 12:10.320
gave myself to him the time we spent I gave him all I had to give that's what

12:10.320 --> 12:15.360
relationships are I give and take you give your all to someone and you expect

12:15.360 --> 12:21.960
them to do the same for you and you know what he does just runs away out of the

12:21.960 --> 12:28.160
blue no talking no indication anything is wrong just leaves I couldn't

12:28.160 --> 12:32.560
understand I was high off of my affection for him and I thought he was

12:32.560 --> 12:39.000
the same but I had to hold in my sadness I for one am better than leaving

12:39.000 --> 12:45.880
without a word relationships no matter what should be ended properly after all

12:45.880 --> 12:50.840
sometimes relationships don't work out for reasons you don't understand but

12:50.840 --> 12:56.760
where there was true love there can be a lot of fun to be had right before

12:56.760 --> 13:00.600
cutting ties

13:03.560 --> 13:10.200
after that it was fling after fling a new love here and there all ending the

13:10.200 --> 13:17.960
same way I hate having to be the nice one in the relationship it can't be my

13:17.960 --> 13:23.680
fault I guess men will take any chance to abuse your kindness now the breakup

13:23.680 --> 13:27.480
songs on the radio start to make sense and the sweetest sugars are now as

13:27.480 --> 13:31.760
bitter as vinegar it's times like this when I think I'm about to give up on

13:31.760 --> 13:39.680
love entirely but as they say time heals all wounds after that it feels like

13:39.680 --> 13:43.560
the very first time

13:43.560 --> 14:02.560
wake up Senpai Senpai wake up oh you're still a bit dizzy that's okay I hit

14:02.560 --> 14:08.600

down here oh oh who put that there these are my weaknesses it's it's fine for

22:24.280 --> 22:29.520
for my senpais to know because weaknesses are have to be shared with each

22:29.520 --> 22:39.240
other so my weakness is motion sickness I'm sorry that's that is why most of my

22:39.240 --> 22:43.080
games are like that I have very bad motion sickness that I'm trying to get

22:43.080 --> 22:49.560
over impatient I mean sorry that's the third thing in the way overthinking I

22:49.560 --> 22:55.400
tend to overthink a lot and if things are too simple I might in puzzles I might

22:55.400 --> 23:01.080
overthink them and just go like no it can't be that simple and of course in

23:01.080 --> 23:08.720
patience I'm I'm a little impatient with a lot of things so please forgive me

23:08.720 --> 23:19.120
after all we all have weaknesses all right okay okay here are my goals senpai

23:19.120 --> 23:24.440

23:24.560 --> 23:28.640

23:28.640 --> 23:35.120

24:39.240 --> 24:47.200
very punny with my tags as well so in 2.0 I'm going to ask my senpai's for a

24:47.200 --> 24:52.720
bit of help with my tags so for example my general tag I need something for that

24:52.720 --> 24:58.880

25:29.760 --> 25:38.320
scissors broken the heart but I don't want my heart broken so you guys will

25:38.320 --> 25:44.480
fix that up right and the fan name for these little guys are called snippets

25:44.480 --> 25:49.760
originally they were supposed to be called heartbreakers but I really don't

25:49.760 --> 25:53.040
want my heart broken so now they're little snippets aren't they really cute

25:53.040 --> 25:59.920
aren't they little aren't they super super adorable guy I think they're super

25:59.960 --> 26:12.000
cute oh they're so sweet all right let's talk about my favorite thing my

26:12.000 --> 26:18.840
gen mates aren't they super cute these are drawn in the style of set cheese like

26:18.840 --> 26:27.440
blue archive blue archive work so they're super super funny and cute so my

26:27.480 --> 26:34.600
first impressions of my gen mates is that in me is surprisingly hick but in a

26:34.600 --> 26:40.880
cute way baby girl can be quite ruthless super talented at everything she does

26:40.880 --> 26:48.720
has no weaknesses and she's super funny she's a she's a super memer I see when

26:48.720 --> 26:55.520
I first saw her I thought she would be super messy get key and guess what I was

26:55.520 --> 27:02.520
right she's a baby polar bear would protect but she'll probably bite me

27:02.520 --> 27:09.040
actually the cutest as I said she doesn't have the best food takes I think

27:09.040 --> 27:17.080
that she likes she has really good food and she's a really passionate and

27:17.080 --> 27:23.960
amazing DJ you guys saw that set right so good and then there's mommy

27:23.960 --> 27:29.160
mommy sometimes I'm scared of her not gonna lie sometimes I'm scared of her

27:29.160 --> 27:36.280
but I feel very loved she's easygoing as much as she doesn't say she's like she

27:36.280 --> 27:39.640
says that she's not professional I believe she's super professional as well

27:40.520 --> 27:48.840
and she's very clumsy but in a like a super cute way she be she be is so brave

27:48.840 --> 27:54.840
like everything is waters off the ducks back very independent cool independent

27:54.840 --> 28:02.200
woman she's a hard worker maybe she works too hard she has such a wide range in

28:02.200 --> 28:07.880
her voice as well so I think that's really cool that she's like able to reach

28:08.280 --> 28:11.480
different voice tones that's that's really amazing

28:13.400 --> 28:20.280
Azura right here is I thought she was a dancer when I first saw her because of

28:20.280 --> 28:25.880
her colors or like a fortune teller she is mommy like that's it she's mommy that's

28:25.880 --> 28:31.640
