00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What better story than that of a modest young student turned violent yandere overnight?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I didn't always look like this, but maybe you're enjoying the view.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You better be careful staring at me like that.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I might want to call you my next senpai.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, don't ask what happened to the last one.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm Mercy Modiste.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Because either way, you'll be screaming for mercy.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'd say don't be scared of me, but fear is a top shelf ad for DZAC.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hahahaha!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, come on.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Don't pretend you don't want more of me.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I better see you on June 1st.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's when I debut.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Senpai.
