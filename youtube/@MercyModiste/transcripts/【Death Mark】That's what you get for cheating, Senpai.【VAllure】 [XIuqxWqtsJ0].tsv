630000	647740	I'm sorry everyone I uh wouldn't stop hiccuping before stream I wouldn't stop
647740	654240	hiccuping before stream and then I drank a lot of water I wouldn't stop
654240	657120	hiccuping and then I stopped hiccuping and then my tummy started to hurt really
657120	674360	badly. But hello everyone. Serenity raided me I missed it I'm sorry. Serenity
674360	682000	still here thank you for the raid and welcome everyone to the stream welcome
682000	691120	Senpai. Today we are playing a game called Deathmark. I won't lie to you I've
691120	695520	played a bit of this game before but then I put it on a very long hiatus and
695520	700880	totally forgot about everything that happened to it and I did this twice
700880	709400	already. So if I feel like I'm starting to remember some stuff that's why and I'm
709400	717120	on a completely new account. Let's go! I mean hold on. Let's go!
717120	736800	Hey want to hit up the karaoke place? The new love and hero song is out.
736800	748800	I'm not feeling it. I'm not feeling up to it today. This story creeped me out
748800	761920	earlier. Do you want to hear it? Oh chair. You remember Miss Yamaguchi? She wears
761920	777080	those big glasses. I heard she's gone missing. What? No one knows where she is?
777800	790160	Nope she just disappeared. Just up and poofed from the library. Okay new voice
790200	796800	time. One of the student librarians said she was researching something there but
796800	803080	then she vanished. But she's super diligent right? One of the students thought
803080	812440	it was weird that she'd up and leave like that. So he checked in on her. But when he
812440	827280	did, the only thing left was her arm. Had her really weird scar on it. So it was
827280	840120	definitely her arm. A scar? Yeah. It looked like a dog bite. He showed it to me
840120	854920	once. Had no idea where it came from. Burial? There was a scar like that on
854920	872280	Miki's leg too. Huh? Miki? Wait that's the girl who went missing. Yeah. It's crazy. Maybe
872280	882840	that rumor's true. The one about the cursed scar. Cut it out. You're scaring me. I forgot
882840	896920	which Valley Girl was who now. Sorry. I hear snatches of an idiotic ghost stories. They're
896920	902640	speaking seriously. It's obvious that they don't believe a word. They're only
902640	916520	killing time. Rumors are the best way to do that. The sun's about to set. It's gotten
916520	934400	later than I planned. I shouldn't have stuck around to hear that story. I better hurry.
934400	959600	Bye tonight else. Thunder rumbles in the distance. A huge mansion is in front of me. Strange.
959600	971560	I'm sure I was just. My vision blurs. My ears are buzzing. My head's swimming. It's
971560	981280	almost like I'm drunk. What time is it? A glass at my wrist, but my watch is gone. I
981280	989600	put it in my coat pocket. And all I find is a business card. In elegant printed letters
989600	1000560	is a name. Saya Kujo, spirit healer. On the back is a photo of the mansion. I guess this
1000560	1010680	must be Kujo Mansion then? Kujo Mansion, Saya Kujo. Those names sound familiar somehow.
1010680	1018000	One way to find out, taking a deep breath, I reach out to knock. I stop when I see something
1018000	1032480	on my wrist. It's a strange scar. Wonder that. I could just be imagining this, but feel an
1032480	1049280	icy chill when I look at it. My fur, my fists pounds on the door, no reply. A light appears
1049280	1054200	in the second floor window. It's probably too far from the door for them to hear me
1054200	1065560	knocking. Don't they have doorbells in this day and age? I grafts the door knob and find
1065560	1075360	it unlocked. No point in staying outside. I'll just go in. I'll apologize to the owner
1075360	1091400	later. Inside is shrouded in darkness. A small beam of light from the window is the
1091400	1097800	only way I can see anything in here. It's dead silent except for the constant ticking
1097800	1109360	of a clock's second hand. I must be in the entrance hall. The atrium extends to the second
1109360	1119720	floor. Anyone home? There's no reply to my shout. Maybe they've soundproofed this place
1119720	1125840	so they can't hear me downstairs. I guess I need to go upstairs then. A staircase is
1125880	1135560	just visible up ahead. I walk towards it, cutting across the hall. With what light? My ears catch a
1135560	1148720	strange noise. I turn to look where it's coming from. Someone's there. I fell up by the dark.
1149600	1164080	I think they're staring at me. What should we do? Ten pie! I'm gonna approach them. What do you
1164080	1177760	guys want to do? I'm gonna approach them. Gulping. I hesitantly make my way over.
1177760	1187520	Trepidation slowing my steps. Ooh! Trepidation! That's a good idea. Word of the day everyone!
1187520	1204040	Trepidation! It's a young girl. She doesn't move an inch as I approach. Girl, you just had
1204040	1218720	your eyes open. I know you did. At least it seems that way to me. Doesn't look like she's even
1218720	1230800	breathing. They're corpse? Great, I creep myself out. I start to sweat. What should I do?
1230800	1259160	Sampai! I'm gonna do the bad touch. The shaky hand, I slowly reach out and touch your skin.
1260120	1271800	I'm not sure what I expected, but it feels unnatural somehow. It's stiff and cold.
1271800	1290600	I press down on her arm and she makes the strange sound I heard earlier. Ah, now it makes sense.
1291320	1300840	She's a doll. A doll's joint creak when they move. That's what made the noise. Not a relief if disappointing.
1311080	1314360	I carefully begin climbing the stairs, making sure not to trip.
1314360	1325880	As I reach the landing, the sharp sound of a bell breaks the silence. It seems to be coming from above me.
1325880	1336600	Looking up, I can spy the outline of a cloth. I bet that's what's making the sound.
1337160	1350680	Should we approach it? Approach it or wait? What do you think, Sampai?
1351000	1358760	It's a group activity. Wait, wait, wait, okay.
1365000	1365960	Okay, let's see.
1371000	1373560	I saw wait first, so we're gonna do wait.
1374520	1380120	I pause and wait for the clamor to end.
1389640	1396920	It doesn't seem to be stopping. Maybe it's broken. Okay, I guess we don't wait then.
1400440	1401480	Should we approach it then?
1403720	1408520	Approach it menacingly.
1410600	1416920	Oh, the noise guides me over.
1420040	1426280	It's an antique grandfather clock. The noise is definitely coming from here.
1427240	1430200	I reach toward the glass to check inside.
1433320	1435000	All of a sudden, it stops chiming.
1438760	1441320	Silence descends, broken only by ticking.
1444440	1452120	I guess it's fixed now, but that timing was a little too spot on. Was it really a coincidence?
1452120	1461160	All these strange occurrences make me uneasy, but I continue on to the room with the light.
1465480	1469720	Stopping in front of the door, I knock.
1476200	1478600	But again, there's no reply.
1483080	1489960	I try again several times, even calling out, but there's still no answer. I push on the door.
1494520	1498040	It's dark inside. What's that on the ground?
1502440	1507320	Strange, I definitely saw lights on in here when I was outside.
1507880	1513640	Wafting through the room is an odd smell.
1516520	1522200	It's sugary, like ripe fruit. The whole room is permeated with it.
1523640	1528840	Some kind of aromatherapy, maybe? And a particularly pleasant smell, though.
1530920	1533080	The aroma draws me further into the room.
1537320	1544440	And the floor under my feet feels off. It's wet.
1547640	1551560	It dawns on me that I'm smelling something else mixed with the sweet smell.
1555320	1558440	Chat sometimes blocks the dialogue window. Can you adjust the game screen?
1558440	1561400	Okie dokie.
1567800	1570280	It doesn't look that great, but is this okay, Senpai?
1582440	1582760	Good.
1583160	1594600	Well, you didn't want to just hear the sound of my voice. You needed your subtitles so that you can go along with me.
1594600	1614440	We need to practice reading for your USL classes, of course. Okie dokie.
1615240	1624920	But, like, oh yeah, I clicked off the screen. I know this scent. This metallic tang.
1639160	1642920	Lightning flashes, then catch a glimpse of something.
1645320	1650840	The startling grotesque object stretches out across the floor beneath my feet.
1651880	1654760	Something strange is there.
1657080	1659800	What should we do? Stare at it?
1666200	1670040	Should we stare at it? We're gonna stare.
1670200	1678200	Alright. So bizarre that I can't stop staring.
1683720	1685400	Blooming flowers are everywhere.
1688120	1693080	They're bursting out of the woman's stomach. A blood-soaked body overwhelmed with them.
1693640	1700600	I really hate the look of Lotus Pods. I absolutely hate the look of him.
1704040	1712840	I wrench my gaze away, horrified. But the hellish image is burned into my mind. I can feel my entire body shaking.
1712840	1723560	Bio-Rises. I'm gonna throw up. Haha, what's new?
1742840	1745000	In the next instant, the lights are on.
1750200	1755160	Wait, that's not all. The body is gone, leaving only a stain.
1757960	1765880	This doesn't make sense. Bad dream, at least. I'd really, had really much preferred if it was
1766920	1772280	the faint smell that remains in the blood-stained crush my any hope I had of it.
1772840	1780520	I beat a retreat from the room in an effort to escape this whole bizarre situation.
1789080	1792440	When I stumble back into the hall, the lights are on in here as well.
1794920	1800040	I decide to have another look around. While the furnishing in here are old enough to be antiques,
1801000	1803160	I match this old-fashioned mansion.
1807480	1812040	A large doll sits on a couch. This must be the figure I saw in the dark.
1813240	1816840	One would easily mistake this for a human if they couldn't see the ball joints.
1819800	1821880	Probably belongs to the owner of the mansion.
1822520	1827160	But what do I do now?
1828120	1829160	Contact the police?
1829880	1833320	Their stomach was full of flour, sir, and the corpse stopped and vanished like fog.
1833880	1835320	Like anyone would believe that.
1841880	1846520	Welcome. Welcome to Kujo Mansion.
1852520	1857320	The doll moved and spoke.
1860360	1866120	A different kind of shutter runs through me, and the one I found, the corpse.
1867560	1872600	Up until this point, I was nothing more than an observer to all these freaky events.
1872600	1882360	I could distance myself from it, but now a doll is talking to me.
1885480	1886680	Have I startled you?
1888200	1891400	If so, I sincerely apologize.
1892680	1898360	My master ordered me to behave like a normal doll until told otherwise.
1898520	1905400	The words are elegant and refined, but her face never moves an inch.
1906680	1909320	She may look human, but she clearly isn't.
1915320	1919320	She slowly folds her hands together, though she can move too.
1921240	1923720	I'm sorry for not introducing myself.
1923960	1926520	I'm called Mary.
1928120	1932680	You have likely seen a number of oddities here already.
1935000	1941160	I see my master, Zaya Kujo, was unable to escape from the mark then.
1944040	1946920	Zaya Kujo, does she mean that corpse?
1948200	1950120	But wait, what about this mark?
1950120	1951720	What about this bell to mark?
1953880	1957560	Lady Zaya was searching for a way to escape the mark.
1959720	1963960	Were you not also called here by her because of the mark on your arm?
1969480	1971560	She must be talking about this weird scar.
1972840	1975480	Did Zaya Kujo invite me to this mansion?
1977560	1980440	When I try to remember, my head hurts.
1984680	1988280	I have something to tell you in place of my light master,
1989960	1992840	but I would like to ask one thing first.
1994440	1996520	Do you know your own name?
1998760	2001720	Well, that was a much simpler question than I had been expecting.
2002760	2003240	It's...
2003240	2013400	I break out into a sweat.
2014280	2015400	My throat is drying up.
2017640	2018440	Why?
2018440	2019560	Why can't I answer?
2020600	2022680	I'm shocked to find I'm coming up blank.
2024200	2024840	I see.
2025800	2027400	Then it is as I thought.
2028040	2031480	Somehow, Mary knows what's going on with me.
2032760	2039160	Before I offer an explanation, please decide on a temporary name.
2040520	2045400	Things will go much easier if I have a name I wish to call you.
2047720	2053640	It is also likely you will find it hard to remain calm if you are nameless.
2053960	2054920	She's probably right.
2055640	2063000	Better to have some placeholder name than continue life as a hollow nameless being.
2066440	2070040	Enter the protagonist's last name, up to 10 letters.
2078360	2079160	Okay, delete.
2083800	2087160	No, no, no, no, no.
2089640	2090280	Last name.
2092200	2099800	First name.
2114280	2123800	Oops.
2129960	2135800	We have to deduce formalities, of course.
2138680	2141000	He's literally you, for real, for real.
2141000	2141800	Senpai, Senpai.
2143800	2155400	Can't it be Senpai Modest?
2156440	2158600	No, I have to take your last name, Senpai.
2158600	2159800	So it's Senpai Senpai.
2168200	2168520	Yes.
2170680	2172440	It's Senpai Senpai, okay.
2172440	2173640	It cannot be changed.
2185320	2185640	Yeah.
2188760	2190200	Not Darling Senpai?
2190840	2192760	Well, then it would say Darling.
2194040	2199160	Depending on the person, they'll say Darling-san, Senpai-san.
2199160	2202040	I want to Senpai-san, Senpai-san.
2202840	2208200	Okay.
2218280	2220520	You okay with others calling you Senpai?
2220520	2221080	Of course.
2222200	2225320	Now, if they have a crush on you, on the other hand, that's different.
2225720	2233320	After all, Senpai must be Senpai in every situation.
2234280	2237080	Besides, if you die, that's just in character, isn't it?
2250040	2251560	She berayed.
2251560	2255800	Excuse me, I got to adjust myself.
2259640	2259960	Okay.
2266280	2267480	Welcome, Raiders.
2267480	2268840	Welcome.
2268840	2274840	Welcome my baby girl.
2274840	2280600	She be cotton bomb.
2282040	2285560	Welcome to the stream.
2287720	2288520	Welcome, welcome.
2288520	2291080	We are naming the protagonist right now.
2291080	2292760	How was your stream?
2293480	2297800	I totally forgot what you were playing because I was out all day.
2300680	2302760	Gosh, I love my gen mate so much.
2304360	2308280	But I can go back and be like, hold on.
2309240	2310360	Fine, fine.
2310360	2313800	You guys, you have variety now.
2315800	2316120	Fine.
2316120	2317880	I'll give you variety, Senpai.
2327400	2329800	I went Dar-villor.
2339000	2340040	V-Darling.
2340040	2342040	Wow, that's going to be...
2345000	2347720	When is someone going to start that up, huh?
2354600	2358520	Chibis was fighting tamper vampires, now fighting Fa.
2361240	2362200	Like the food, right?
2363080	2368440	Oh, I spelled Senpai wrong.
2368440	2372440	Do I even love Senpai if I spell Senpai's name wrong?
2376440	2377320	Oh, fuck it.
2383320	2384120	There we go.
2385080	2385960	There we go.
2393480	2394680	Senpai, darling.
2394680	2395080	Okay?
2404840	2406120	The dyslexia hitting.
2406680	2409240	Oh, oh, we get to choose our luck.
2409240	2412280	Senpai, you get to choose the luck.
2412520	2415640	Look, do you want glasses and beard?
2415640	2416360	Beard?
2416360	2417400	Just glasses?
2417400	2417800	Nothing?
2423160	2425000	You want to wear glasses?
2425000	2426360	You want to just have a beard?
2430840	2431560	Just glasses?
2431560	2432680	I just see glasses.
2432680	2434680	Okay, glasses it is.
2435560	2437080	It's this okay?
2439560	2444120	Yeah, let's fucking go.
2446120	2446600	I'm...
2448600	2449080	Excuse me.
2450200	2451480	I'm Senpai, darling.
2457080	2459080	Understood, Lord Darling.
2459240	2461880	Now, I shall explain to you about the mark.
2467400	2469240	It is the Seal of Death.
2470200	2472200	Those who have it will soon die.
2474200	2475400	You do not believe me?
2478440	2481960	I'm certain this sounds absurd to want to know.
2481960	2483960	I'm sure it's the seal of death.
2483960	2485960	I'm sure it's the seal of death.
2486520	2491720	I'm certain this sounds absurd to want you as loved at an eventful life.
2494440	2499000	However, my master's death proves it to be irrefutably true.
2503960	2505000	The Carps?
2505000	2507560	The Carp's sweet stench comes back to me.
2509320	2511160	It didn't seem like the work of humans.
2511880	2519480	I'm afraid that the horror of the mark does not stop there.
2522280	2525960	Victims slowly lose their memories until the day they die.
2527080	2532840	They face death all the while suffering from the terror of losing oneself.
2539560	2540440	Memory loss?
2541880	2543080	I can't be that.
2543080	2544360	That would mean that I'm...
2546120	2546520	Yes.
2547400	2552680	The fact that you have forgotten your name proves that death is coming.
2555880	2557640	Lord Darling, you...
2561640	2563080	...will die this very dawn.
2566120	2566760	Death mark.
2571400	2581160	Yes, I think I named the protagonist aptly.
2582280	2586760	Remember, senpai, your mortality is always finite.
2596840	2599480	My memories skip forward a bit after that.
2600440	2605160	I just remember being completely stunned at what Mary revealed to me.
2610280	2614760	I can probably attribute it to memory loss caused by the mark.
2618040	2619240	The next thing I know...
2623560	2625640	...I'm lying in a guest room in the mansion.
2625640	2631400	I vaguely recall dragging myself up the stairs and coming here.
2636760	2640680	I must have fallen asleep at some point, and thanks to that I feel a lot better.
2642920	2644120	I'll die at dawn, huh?
2646840	2648280	I try saying it out loud.
2649480	2653080	It's definitely shocking, but I can't say it feels real yet.
2654040	2656120	It doesn't make sense, way out of the blue.
2656760	2662280	But if it's true, is waiting for my untimely death the only thing I can do?
2666520	2668920	It might be a good idea to ask Mary more about it.
2676680	2680520	I find Mary sitting in the exact same spot as before.
2681240	2682520	She hasn't moved an inch.
2683800	2689000	I doubt a doll gets bored waiting like humans do.
2692840	2693480	Good morning.
2696040	2698360	Good morning, Lord, darling.
2700280	2702600	Maybe we should save before I do something crazy?
2704040	2706120	Is there a save option?
2706520	2714200	Are you... are you feeling better now?
2717800	2719800	Well, how do you feel, Senpai?
2726520	2727880	Yeah, you're fine.
2727880	2729800	Fine, Senpai, you're all fine.
2732440	2732920	Sort of?
2733880	2736280	Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, I see more yeses.
2738840	2740280	That's good to hear.
2743400	2745720	Yeah, I'm gonna adjust my voice for her, give me a second.
2747160	2751800	Since it appears that you have calmed down, I would like to ask you a question.
2753080	2754680	Okay, yeah, I think this is better.
2755720	2756440	What do you guys think?
2757960	2758840	What does Senpai think?
2759000	2763000	Yeah, I'm gonna go up here.
2765640	2766760	What will you do now?
2770040	2772920	I can guide you down only two paths.
2774360	2776040	The first is to wait for death.
2777400	2779320	The second is to fight the mark.
2780920	2782600	Can... can you help me?
2784280	2786360	If that is what you wish, yes.
2789080	2792200	My master was researching the mark.
2793160	2797240	A few days prior to her death, he found a way to escape it.
2797960	2801720	Regretfully, she passed away before she was able to inform me.
2805720	2807720	So she doesn't know anything after all.
2809000	2811560	There is some time yet before dawn.
2812920	2814360	You have a slim chance.
2815160	2818760	Salvation is a thin thread dangling from heaven.
2820120	2824520	Would you put that you would grab hold of?
2825320	2827560	And I shall do my utmost to help.
2830520	2831400	What will you do?
2834600	2837480	I guess this boils down to whether I trust her.
2838440	2843000	If she's right about all this, my time on earth is up at dawn.
2843880	2847720	If I don't want to die, then there's no other choice but to resist the mark until then.
2848840	2851240	If she's lying, I'll be fine when the morning comes.
2852040	2853800	And am I really alright with that?
2856120	2857720	Aw, I got blinded.
2860040	2863880	People are being killed in nonsensical, grotesque ways.
2864680	2866840	Am I going to turn a blind eye to it?
2873000	2874440	This is a life or death decision.
2875240	2876600	I need to think about it carefully.
2883080	2885400	Live or die.
2889640	2890360	Deadly choice.
2892040	2895080	You will be faced with choices that can result in death.
2895880	2898680	It is limited time and your soul power will continue to drain.
2898920	2903640	Time's up or wrong answers will result in a game over.
2904360	2907960	So be quick, but also careful in finding the right answers.
2910680	2912040	Restoring soul power.
2912920	2916600	Completing a deadly choice will restore some soul power.
2918200	2919480	Accelerated dialogue.
2920200	2923000	Dialogue will be sped up while pressing the left button.
2924120	2926200	But certain dialogue cannot be sped up.
2926760	2927400	Backlog.
2927960	2931320	Start with display previous dialogue.
2932680	2933320	Auto mode.
2933880	2935800	The right button will activate auto mode.
2937560	2939080	Hiding the dialogue window.
2939640	2942120	You can hide the dialogue window by pressing Y.
2947320	2953640	Then I shall ask you, will you quietly wait for death or struggle against the mark?
2956360	2960360	We're going to fight the mark, obviously.
2965240	2965740	Safe.
2971080	2971800	Survived.
2980680	2982040	I've decided to trust you.
2982600	2986120	As you say, Lord Diving.
2988040	2992440	Then I shall carry out the dying wish of my master and aid you.
2994040	2997800	I cannot do much, but feel free to request anything you wish of me.
3005240	3008040	I made up my mind, but that doesn't mean I know what I should do.
3008840	3013000	And I'll squat about the supernatural and losing my memory makes research impossible.
3013880	3015160	I don't have a moment to lose.
3018120	3019560	A knock comes from the front door.
3020280	3021560	It would come here this late at night.
3023960	3026520	Oh my, what a sign of fate.
3027400	3029960	It seems the other markbearers have arrived.
3032440	3034440	Is it instinct that she knows these things?
3035400	3039480	Maybe she has some kind of mysterious power being a talking doll and all.
3041320	3043560	I beg your pardon, Lord Diving.
3044920	3046280	I do apologize.
3047000	3049320	But could you go greet our guests in my stead?
3051480	3055720	They may experience a shock of a doll such as myself welcomes them.
3056680	3060680	Moreover, while I'm able to move my arms, I am unable to walk.
3065400	3067800	I move to the front door to greet our guests.
3069160	3071400	People fated to die like me.
3072360	3073400	I wonder what they're like.
3078840	3083480	Who I find at the door are not who I expect to see this late at night.
3085720	3090840	A high schooler and a small boy.
3091800	3093480	These kids have the mark?
3093880	3094440	No way.
3100280	3105960	Um, we came to see Professor Kujo.
3107160	3107800	Who are you?
3109640	3112760	I can't say I'm a total stranger since I'm here at the mansion.
3114360	3114600	I'm...
3118120	3118360	So...
3121240	3121960	What do you want?
3124120	3124920	Sampai?
3126520	3127160	What do you want?
3128440	3129160	Do you want to be...
3133320	3134120	her relative?
3135240	3136040	Her disciple?
3138760	3140200	Her relative or disciple?
3146440	3147160	No!
3147160	3149480	Boyfriend is not an option!
3150440	3151720	Boyfriend is not an option!
3151720	3152520	No option!
3154120	3154920	You're mine!
3154920	3155560	Mine!
3164520	3166120	Sampai's cheating on me.
3179480	3182760	You're not going to make me cry, right?
3185880	3187960	Okay, let's go with relative.
3203880	3204520	Oh.
3204600	3206760	So, you're her older brother.
3207640	3209400	Your eyes do kind...
3210280	3212440	Do look kind similar.
3212440	3215320	Sorry, I've decided to go on with a different voice for her already.
3217320	3219000	She seems to know Saiyaku-jou.
3219800	3222840	I think about it, that business card did say Spirit Healer.
3228040	3229640	Going off this girl's acceptance.
3229640	3232280	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3233240	3236840	Going off this girl's accessories, I get the feeling she's a huge occult fan.
3239880	3241400	I'm Moe Watanabe.
3242360	3245000	I'm here to talk to her about this article she wrote in no...
3246680	3247960	Oop! Oop! Arts!
3248600	3249080	Monthly!
3251800	3254120	She pulls out an occult magazine out of her bag.
3256200	3257560	Inside is a picture of the mark.
3263160	3266040	Accompanying articles as the scar is.
3267720	3273000	A soul-inhibiting disease that erases memories inquire at Kujo Mansion.
3275720	3279480	Um, this is the same scar, right?
3282520	3286440	Moe ellipses her skirt up a bit to show me her leg.
3287240	3288280	Don't look, Senpai!
3289000	3292200	Right there on her right thigh is the mark.
3294120	3298280	I think I know what the article means by erasing memories.
3300600	3302680	I've been super forgetful lately.
3302680	3304600	I'm even blanking on my friend's names.
3307480	3309240	That's never happened to me before.
3312040	3313560	Do you think the scar is doing it?
3314280	3318280	This article is obviously bogus.
3320120	3321320	The young boy scoffs.
3322440	3325960	Even kids know better than to believe in ghosts or curses these days.
3338120	3339800	And a high schooler fell for it.
3339800	3341240	You must be embarrassed about this.
3341960	3347800	But Tsukasa, where did you hang around in the front of the Williams Mansion's key?
3348680	3350360	Biss up, your scar scares you.
3353800	3356280	Tsukasa seems to have no retort for that.
3357160	3358440	He silently soaks.
3361080	3362200	Looks like a bullseye.
3364840	3366760	It's clear they're both mark-bearers.
3367880	3369400	Better bring them over to meet Mary.
3371400	3375880	Moe shrieks excitingly as she gets close.
3377240	3378920	Oh my god, it's so cute!
3379640	3380760	It's a doll, yeah?
3380760	3382360	I've never seen one this big before.
3386680	3388920	The craftsmanship is so detailed.
3388920	3390360	It's almost like it's alive.
3391560	3392920	They're both admiring her one.
3395160	3397160	Welcome to Kujo Mansion.
3398680	3399560	What?
3399560	3400200	It's Spock.
3401480	3406760	With that, the two new visitors join our numbers.
3406760	3408440	They enter this monstrous world.
3409240	3411400	That hover on the precipice of death.
3415400	3420440	Mary tells Moe and Tsukasa about the mark once they regain their composure.
3422920	3426600	All about the steady memory loss and their imminent death.
3427560	3432600	It sounds like a ridiculous story, but it gains validity coming from someone like her.
3436760	3438200	Both of their faces pale.
3440040	3446600	Now, if you came specifically here because you believe that Lady Sia's article.
3447320	3458600	You must have already experienced the pain of losing your memories.
3461560	3465400	Moe admitted as much earlier, but I can see Tsukasa's face darken.
3466200	3467960	So it must be happening to him too.
3469880	3471320	Oh, what kind of tea today?
3471960	3480360	I for gore, give me a second as I regain my memory.
3487320	3489640	I for gore, maybe I have a death mark too.
3501960	3510360	The funny thing is that I specifically picked out this tea
3512280	3517480	because I knew Senpai's would ask, but then I forgot.
3518680	3519480	Give me a second.
3523400	3525240	Ah, okay.
3525240	3525800	I remember.
3525800	3526840	I remember now.
3526840	3527320	I remember.
3529160	3530040	It's Tulsi.
3530600	3531640	Tulsi Ginger.
3538280	3539240	Tulsi.
3543880	3546600	I was just about to google the tea brand and be like,
3546600	3550920	maybe if I look at the labels, I would remember.
3550920	3560040	Is it any good?
3560040	3560920	And yeah, I think so.
3560920	3565640	It's got kind of like a mellow or earthy taste.
3569160	3569880	Tulsi.
3569880	3571640	T-U-L-S-I.
3575640	3578680	Like, there's a VTuber with that name.
3581320	3590360	There's a VTuber with that name.
3601160	3602520	I think she's with Sony.
3606680	3609960	I would repeat a meme that went around.
3610920	3612040	About her.
3612040	3615160	Or a viral tweet that went around about her.
3615160	3620120	But that might not be safe for YouTube.
3628360	3630440	She's on the JP side.
3633560	3634840	I know, I know, I know.
3636840	3637720	I know Senpai.
3641320	3651480	I will give you a hint.
3654520	3655800	I'll give you a hint.
3660200	3665160	Someone mistook
3665160	3679080	15, 15, 15 men, meaning years, and translated to 15,
3679080	3680760	about 15,000.
3680760	3687720	I think 15,000 men, so men being year, to 15,000 men.
3687720	3691880	So I'll let your imagination go wild with that.
3695160	3721080	I actually watched her debut and everyone was trolling her.
3721080	3724360	Of course, Sony did a cease and desist on that.
3724360	3731880	So you'll have to just do, well, what did they, what do you guys say?
3732760	3734200	Do your reps?
3734200	3740280	Yeah, you have to do your reps.
3754680	3759080	Also, yeah, this week's homework.
3760840	3766360	It's hard to catch up with the lingo that lots of people use.
3766360	3774920	I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting a like crash course on like what, what some things mean.
3779800	3780280	So yeah,
3781000	3783480	that was, that was really fun.
3784680	3787160	Actually, I hear she's a very nice person.
3787160	3791800	So yeah, I really do like her design though.
3791800	3795960	If you're, if you're a fan of,
3796280	3812120	um, canoes, canoes, like, like, uh, I see, or Emmy, you might like her design.
3820600	3822840	It must be happening to him too.
3823080	3831960	I'm going to scoot in closer.
3836840	3838120	I was totally the wrong voice.
3839960	3840520	Okay, okay.
3842440	3847960	The peachy kind of light color.
3853720	3858760	Why do I call them canoes?
3864280	3869960	Canoe.
3878440	3881960	I'm making things up.
3882840	3889000	But I'm talking about, you know, the little, little canoes.
3892920	3899960	You know, the boat, you paddle.
3900680	3915080	Hey, Moe, I'd like to confirm something.
3923480	3925000	Where were you when you got the mark?
3926600	3928520	Amnesia seems to be worse than theirs.
3930520	3931480	They might remember.
3936440	3938120	The canoes need correction, right?
3938120	3939960	Yeah, they need to be corrected
3941880	3953080	so that they can, you know, float correctly.
3960440	3967160	They might, so they might remember.
3968360	3970120	I'm not positive, but
3975400	3983080	I think my mark might have been a curse from Hana Hiko.
3985800	3986600	Hana Hiko.
3990920	3999080	Thank you, Senpai.
3999080	4000280	Beto the snippet.
4001160	4007240	Mercy is the only person who is entirely charm points
4007240	4009480	and we're all lucky to be her Senpai.
4009480	4010840	Oh, thank you.
4010840	4013080	You are all lucky.
4020680	4026840	But thank you, Senpai, for the 420.
4030920	4033080	This name is familiar to me.
4035480	4039800	He's the ghost of the resident children of this town whisper about, right?
4042600	4043800	Oh, sorry, it's correct.
4044760	4046760	My master was interested in him.
4046920	4056440	So Sayakujo was interested, was curious too, could be connected to the mark some day.
4059000	4060440	I'd like to hear more about this ghost.
4064440	4066440	As you wish, Lord Darling.
4071560	4074440	And I shall tell you the rumors of Hana Hiko.
4077240	4077880	Chapter one.
4079880	4080520	Hana Hiko.
4083000	4085400	Sorry, I need to do a cuter laugh, right?
4089560	4091560	Oh, did you hear?
4091560	4093160	Oops, that was my controller.
4095320	4099160	About the ghost boy, all the schools in H City are talking about.
4101800	4103480	Sounds like Hana Hiko is back.
4107720	4115880	I heard he can appear if you peek in the school mirror at night or ask you something.
4118120	4119560	Am I pretty?
4122040	4126120	If you tell him no, you'll be fine, but you say yes.
4126920	4128920	I need that red stuff, then.
4131480	4133480	It just disappears.
4137480	4139480	But that's not all.
4139480	4141480	Hana Hiko hates adults, you know.
4142440	4146440	I heard that if the person he asks is an adult, they'll die.
4148840	4150840	They'll not just drop dead.
4150840	4152840	Blood is drained from them.
4157080	4161320	And next to the carts is a single rose.
4164360	4166760	Arrows dripping with blood.
4173320	4178120	Remakes can be easily manipulated, passing from one person to another.
4178920	4183160	Assumptions and errors mix in, but they also hold a hint of truth.
4184040	4186280	Miss Moe, do you know anything else?
4192520	4198520	I probably cut my mark when I was investigating Hana Hiko at each elementary school.
4200440	4202040	That's got to be some sort of clue.
4202840	4204040	I should ask her more about it.
4206280	4208040	Why were you at H Elementary?
4209240	4211320	My big dream is to write about the cult.
4211320	4212520	I'd love to see a ghost.
4213800	4216920	I found this article in a magazine mentioning Hana Hiko was seen there.
4217560	4220600	I figured that place would be easier to sneak in than a regular school,
4221400	4222440	since it's been closed down.
4223880	4224920	What should I ask next?
4225640	4226680	Was Hana Hiko there?
4227560	4230200	I don't think so, but I can't really say for sure.
4231000	4235720	I went to the mirror, but a shipper suddenly ran down my spine and I got spooked and left.
4237080	4238040	What should I ask next?
4238920	4239960	When did you notice the mark?
4240760	4242280	I noticed it later in the bath.
4243240	4245320	A strange scar was suddenly on my thigh.
4245320	4246360	It really surprised me.
4247240	4250760	I realized immediately it had to be what Professor Kujo wrote about.
4256200	4259000	Fellow high-patch haver, I have an iPad in real life.
4263240	4264600	Twinsies!
4269880	4272360	You know, when I think, I think I recall.
4273160	4274120	Is this a spoiler?
4275400	4280280	But I did guess this before I played the game.
4281480	4287720	Well, no, when I first played the game, I think I guessed that the red stuff is like lipstick or something.
4288600	4289800	Rouge, perhaps?
4290840	4291800	Perhaps Rouge?
4301000	4302920	I don't know what kind of makeup.
4303960	4305480	They had in Japan, really.
4311880	4313400	I think I have a handle on what happened.
4313960	4318520	No way to know for sure about the ghost, but if there's no denying,
4318520	4321720	she had the mark after returning home from age elementary.
4325160	4329400	And then, maybe, Tsukasa glanced down at his left hand.
4330120	4332520	The line might be from behind a Hiko tooth.
4333560	4336280	I noticed it after I got home from tea elementary.
4337800	4341720	That ghost was seen a lot in schools in each city, right?
4343800	4347160	Maybe he remembered something, but I asked him some questions too.
4348040	4348920	Tea elementary?
4350200	4351080	Got a school there.
4351960	4356520	You've probably heard of it since it's a top ranked elementary in each city.
4357480	4358520	What should I ask next?
4359160	4359880	When was that?
4360840	4361960	A year-round sunset?
4362680	4365560	I was heading home until I realized I forgot something and turned back.
4368840	4371400	Should I ask Mips and just see Hena Hiko?
4372280	4374840	No, and I didn't get chills or anything either.
4375400	4377160	Oh, but I think I passed a mirror.
4378040	4379720	I went to the bathroom before going home.
4381000	4382200	I don't think he knows anymore.
4383080	4385480	Stories are pretty similar to the Hena Hiko rooms.
4386440	4388360	They can't just be coins in this.
4390760	4394600	You must invest to eat the places for Hena Hiko up here.
4395640	4398040	For their sake, as well as yours.
4399880	4402040	Ah, well, that sounds all well and good, but...
4403160	4404920	What exactly am I investigating?
4406200	4408200	Death and life coexistence.
4409240	4413240	The mark originated there, and a way to erase it will also be there.
4415960	4419240	Did I get breathier for her voice?
4419240	4423480	Oh my goodness, I can't keep track of the voices I'm making for each character.
4424680	4426840	I must be so tired some pie.
4427720	4429240	I must be so tired.
4440280	4442120	No, that was totally not the voice I did.
4442120	4444120	I did like a really creepy voice, huh?
4446040	4446760	My bad.
4447960	4449400	You must find it.
4449400	4450440	Break the key.
4450440	4452440	You need to break the mark's curse.
4453720	4455640	Wait, find the key, and then I'll make the...
4455640	4456760	Oh my gosh, oh.
4458200	4465720	Maybe doing a visual novel for my last day of my debut week was definitely...
4467640	4473080	It was definitely a little bit short-sighted on my side.
4476440	4478680	That is the only way to escape.
4486760	4490040	And all of a sudden, a huge burden was dropped on my shoulders.
4493480	4494840	We can go back to Harvester?
4494840	4495560	No, no, no.
4495560	4500920	If I pick something, we're playing that today unless it's like completely terrible.
4506200	4516200	But I will add Harvester back onto the schedule.
4517160	4518200	Probably the week after.
4522280	4523400	It seems...
4523400	4526120	It seems that Hanahiko appeared at two schools.
4526840	4528040	Where will you investigate?
4529080	4530040	Okay, okay.
4530040	4531080	Logic time.
4531080	4532760	Logic time, Senpai.
4532840	4535880	We're probably going to go to H Elementary instead of T Elementary,
4535880	4548440	because T Elementary is most likely severely guarded since it's a prestigious school,
4548440	4551480	and H Elementary might not be as guarded.
4553560	4555640	Are we still doing Markiller 7 as well?
4555640	4556120	Of course.
4563640	4571480	Yeah, that's probably wise.
4572200	4575240	I'd arrest you on the spot if you tried to sneak into a regular school.
4575240	4576200	I told you!
4576200	4577000	I told you!
4579480	4583560	H Elementary might be a-ha-h-ha-aunted.
4585240	4586520	Scared of a little security?
4588760	4589720	Yeah, just a little bit.
4593640	4596040	A middle-aged man who can't recall his name,
4596040	4598440	let alone his address or job title.
4598440	4600040	Would have no excuse if I got caught.
4601800	4602760	Wanna get going then?
4603400	4604200	Let's do this!
4604840	4605880	Let's do this!
4606600	4607480	Wait, you're coming too?
4608600	4609320	Of course!
4609880	4611880	I haven't given up on seeing Hanahiko yet.
4615880	4616760	She grins at me.
4617880	4620840	Is she really strong, or is this blind optimism?
4622760	4625960	I'm going too.
4627320	4629160	Hey, not you two, seriously.
4630440	4631720	My life's on the line here.
4632680	4634120	I don't want the reason I die to be,
4634120	4635800	because you messed up something.
4635800	4636920	You messed something up.
4636920	4637800	Oh, dang!
4641400	4645080	This kid has no just on me and me, and they'll be right!
4648840	4650200	That's pretty bold.
4650200	4651160	Good thing you're cute.
4653480	4655960	But to bring kids along with me is...
4659320	4660920	I understand your hesitation,
4661880	4663960	but the mark does not discriminate,
4663960	4665960	stealing lives of children and adults.
4666840	4668120	They wish to fight their fate.
4668680	4669560	We should honor that.
4671800	4673800	I suppose human logic doesn't fly
4673800	4675400	when dealing with the supernatural.
4678200	4679560	We'll need to prepare ourselves
4679560	4681160	for the worst if we're gonna survive.
4681960	4685400	Please take only one mark bearer with you, however.
4686680	4688680	A large group will increase the odds
4688680	4690360	of you being detected by spirits.
4692440	4694520	I also ask that you not waste time
4694520	4696040	dwindling with others on the way.
4697320	4698280	It is possible.
4699560	4703160	Unnecessary contact may hasten the effect of the mark.
4704280	4706680	Only engage when absolutely necessary.
4707240	4709160	Keep contact with others to a minimum.
4711720	4712840	Yeah, that's what I'm gonna say.
4715240	4716280	Have a safe trip.
4718360	4721880	Okay, we are not bringing the tiny child.
4722840	4723880	Selecting a partner.
4724760	4726200	First, select a mark bearer.
4726200	4727480	Do this in partner menu.
4728680	4729320	Oh, yeah!
4729320	4730120	Hey, mister!
4731080	4732280	How do you think it'll be a good idea
4732280	4734360	to take notes on what Mary's told us?
4734920	4737000	Your memory's getting worse all the time.
4737000	4738280	We don't want to forget anything.
4741560	4746920	I don't know when I'll lose my memory again.
4749320	4751320	All right, down all the information I get
4751320	4752360	and keep it in my file.
4753160	4755800	Something in it might just save our lives at some point.
4757640	4760040	New info was added to the spirit file
4760040	4761960	rumor of Hanna Hiko other.
4763720	4764440	Spirit file.
4765480	4767880	Important info on spirits will be added
4767880	4768920	to the spirit file.
4769640	4771640	Check it from your bag.
4771640	4773240	Consult it if you need help.
4774840	4776120	Saving and loading.
4776120	4777560	Save at the mansion or hunts.
4778360	4780360	Return to the title screen from the bag
4780920	4782280	to live for your luck to load.
4782280	4783400	Then choose continue.
4786280	4787560	Wait, X to save.
4787560	4788520	Ho, ho, ho!
4788520	4790200	Look, we finally got the save.
4793240	4794040	Partner.
4794920	4798040	We are not taking the smart one.
4798280	4799960	The smart mouth and child.
4799960	4801880	I would want to leave this kid behind.
4802680	4803880	We'll take, we'll take.
4805480	4805960	I knew it!
4805960	4808120	I knew her voice was ganky.
4812840	4813560	Did you hear that?
4813560	4814440	She's super ganky.
4818600	4818920	Big.
4822120	4823160	Okay, Hanna Hiko.
4824600	4826760	Okay, that's not all.
4826840	4827640	Kujo mansion.
4830360	4831560	Yes, adults.
4831560	4832360	It hates adults.
4832360	4836280	Okay, the red stuff.
4836280	4838680	Okay, and.
4838680	4839800	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4840440	4840920	Not that.
4843320	4843720	Exit.
4845880	4848840	First, first we have to get to H elementary.
4851800	4853400	Am I pretty ganky?
4853400	4854440	Ganky Senpai.
4854680	4857480	I feel like I'm pretty ganky, but.
4861160	4865000	But I, I also maybe not.
4865000	4867480	I'm maybe not the most gankiest.
4868920	4869880	Super ganky.
4871960	4874120	Mary says we're free to use the car in the garage.
4876600	4878600	The garage is attached from the mansion.
4879560	4884680	The vintage model van in bicycles only sent the elegant interior.
4889560	4891000	Thank God for careless people.
4891000	4893000	The car key was left in the table.
4894040	4894520	Time to go.
4896200	4896760	Uh, hey.
4897640	4900280	According to Mary, you lost a bunch of your memories, right?
4903480	4905400	Is it okay for you to drive?
4906760	4908200	She looks at me suspiciously.
4909160	4913000	Don't worry, it'll be fine, I think.
4914680	4916280	I'll come back when I take the wheel.
4919080	4920920	Part of that is to convince myself.
4922280	4924200	Well, aren't you missing your license?
4924200	4927880	If a cop finds us, we'll have more to worry about than Hanahiko.
4929400	4932520	She's right about that.
4935880	4937800	But I have a license.
4937880	4940840	But this is not me, this is Senpai.
4941400	4943000	Senpai, do you have a license?
4945880	4948680	But our lives are on the line, so we don't have much of a choice.
4953640	4955240	Okay, okay, okay.
4955240	4962600	Then we're safe if, if more than, if a good, if a handful of Senpais can drive, will survive.
4962600	4963320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4968760	4971000	Once the mark's gone, I'll remember.
4976280	4979640	I'm surprised that a lot of you don't have a driver's license, actually.
4987880	4992440	Then I'll probably just have them reissue it, assuming I ever got one.
4994440	4996200	Oh, now I'm even more worried.
4996920	4998360	Just drive safe, okay?
5000600	5003160	Let's head to H. elementary.
5012360	5013160	Hoteru.
5017320	5019080	Human bodies are remarkable.
5020520	5023880	Back in the garage, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to drive or not.
5024600	5027880	But the second my hand touched the wheel, I wasn't worried anymore.
5031640	5033880	I must have reacted quicker than I expected.
5034680	5038760	And now, it's now easy to guide this monster down the road.
5040920	5046840	Now, thoughts of what I can no longer do start to filter in my head.
5048360	5049080	Hey, mister.
5050040	5052440	Moe pipes up hesitantly.
5054120	5055720	I should have put more.
5056440	5058200	I put too much ganky in that.
5060680	5062920	I'd probably let the silence go on too long.
5065480	5068440	It doesn't seem as cheerful as she was a little while ago.
5069800	5072680	What's it like to lose your memories?
5076840	5078360	That's a hard question to answer.
5080040	5081160	What do you mean?
5084280	5087560	Like, do they all go at once?
5087560	5089240	Or a few pieces at a time?
5100520	5104520	I can't believe I'm just like, just like, hey, mister.
5106040	5108920	She said, hesitantly, hey, mister.
5109320	5109800	Tea.
5114600	5117000	What if you're only left with sad memories?
5117640	5118360	I'd hate that.
5124520	5130040	I don't think it works like that, but I have no idea if it's getting worse or better.
5134600	5138040	I don't know what I was like to begin with, so there's nothing to compare to.
5139880	5142280	In that sense, rather than the memories vanishing,
5143480	5147720	like everything's been painted white, but it feels like.
5149480	5153640	Oh, you sure I'm mature, mister?
5154600	5155960	Take everything so calmly.
5161800	5165240	No, no, no, no, no, no, senpais do not paint it white.
5165240	5166840	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5169480	5170680	We are facing.
5173080	5175720	We are facing some ghosts right now.
5179960	5184200	The conversation dwindles, leaving only the sound of the tires on the road.
5187160	5190920	Then thoughts start popping into my head again, one after another.
5193320	5195240	I know we have to check out that mirror.
5196120	5198680	What else should we investigate?
5198680	5199320	What do you think?
5200680	5201880	The white glance is over it.
5203240	5203880	No idea.
5206280	5209320	I can't even remember my own name.
5210280	5213240	How the hell am I supposed to know what we're doing?
5214760	5215960	Oh, please.
5215960	5217240	I'm really counting on you.
5220360	5221400	Think about everything.
5223160	5224600	I'm talking to a child.
5224600	5227000	I need to show restraint and be a good example.
5227800	5230680	But that's definitely how I really feel.
5235880	5237560	Mercy, this girl is kind of clingy.
5240040	5241080	She's just a kid.
5245720	5246920	I'm pretty clingy.
5246920	5248920	Do you have problems with that, senpai?
5255000	5256520	I stare down the steering wheel.
5257800	5259000	Ah, flashbang.
5272360	5273320	No, no problem.
5273320	5274680	Not only Mercy, it's okay.
5276600	5278280	Also, your coral if it's a kid, gotcha.
5279320	5281080	What are you implying, senpai?
5281720	5285080	I'm saying that you would not have any interest in kids, right?
5286040	5286680	Senpai?
5311640	5315640	Amy and Icy don't count.
5320040	5321240	They don't count.
5323960	5325400	No, they don't count.
5325400	5326680	No, they don't count.
5326680	5331640	Amy is immortal, and I don't know how old Icy is in bear,
5331640	5336760	but bear, but old enough in human years.
5338680	5339000	Okay.
5341560	5348200	You're not interested in high schoolers, right, senpai?
5349000	5350680	Except for me, right?
5351720	5354040	An adult who's sort of role-playing a high schooler.
5355800	5356920	I know I'm a college.
5356920	5370920	I'm college.
5371880	5372920	Wait, I'm college.
5372920	5373480	I'm college.
5373480	5374440	I made a mistake.
5375160	5378600	I just like high school uniforms.
5385800	5392920	Listen, they don't wear sayfuku in university.
5401320	5402760	This is just aesthetics.
5402760	5404120	This is just aesthetics.
5405640	5406520	This is just aesthetics.
5406520	5407400	Shut the fuck up.
5408200	5409400	Memory loss beam.
5413880	5418920	You will forget that I made a fucking lucky boo.
5429160	5430280	Let's continue the game.
5430600	5431080	Yeah.
5436840	5437800	Who's that doll here?
5437800	5441400	Oh, yeah, let's do the game.
5450600	5452120	A doll in the mansion.
5452120	5453000	Markbearers.
5460680	5465800	Yo, senpai, you forgot.
5465800	5468600	You dozed off a little.
5468600	5470280	We're playing death mark, remember?
5477720	5480120	The mark spirits.
5487000	5488520	And the mysterious deaths.
5491160	5497560	Can't remember, must be the mark.
5497560	5501480	Oh, no, we should go exercise these spirits.
5504600	5505640	Yeah, it's okay.
5505640	5507720	It's okay if senpai is passed out.
5507720	5509560	I'm always taking care of senpai.
5514920	5518600	Also, yeah, senpai has been in a loving relationship with me for a long time,
5518680	5520200	and we're going to have three kids, okay?
5528440	5529880	Feel like I'm going to be buried
5529880	5532680	under all the crushing thoughts that keep popping into my mind.
5538120	5539480	I think three is a good number.
5541560	5543400	I think three per senpai is a good number.
5548920	5560120	What awaits me down the dark road?
5565560	5568200	I actually, to be honest, I don't know.
5570840	5571640	What I'm saying?
5575320	5578360	I think actually three kids in total is fine.
5578840	5588280	Okay, yeah, it's been a long week.
5588280	5590440	I've been, I've been just saying shit.
5595080	5605640	I feel a flutter, flutter, flutter, and mark on my wrist like it's trying to warn me.
5608680	5614440	My brain might not be able to understand, but my body can sense it.
5615960	5617240	That death is closing in.
5618520	5620040	You want daughters or son more?
5621400	5625000	Um, I don't know.
5625000	5628920	I feel like daughters are cuter,
5632440	5634280	but like, I wouldn't mind a son either.
5635320	5636680	Anyways, it doesn't matter.
5636680	5638120	I'll love them no matter what.
5643880	5646920	If that's happening, isn't the problem.
5647880	5649560	It's more how long do I have left?
5652920	5655080	How much, how much longer is it?
5657160	5659640	I almost yell, but I managed to swallow it down with effort.
5662440	5663960	I think we're almost there.
5667640	5673480	Even if our kids are worms, even if you are a worm, Senpai, I would still love you.
5679160	5679880	Really?
5679880	5680280	Really?
5680280	5681400	It's closer than I thought.
5682520	5685800	Yeah, yeah, exactly right.
5688120	5690360	Or at any time it could
5690760	5696040	It's a lot closer than you think.
5706360	5710280	Looming ominously in the moonlight, the school definitely looks abandoned.
5711480	5714920	For quite a number of years, in fact, these walls are starting to crack.
5715880	5717400	All the windows are broken as well.
5718280	5721960	A thick chain is in front of the main gate to keep people from going in.
5725320	5728120	Hey, you there, not another step.
5730840	5733960	An enthusiastic voice comes from a man in a guard uniform.
5735000	5737560	You must be patrolling the area like we got caught.
5739480	5741720	This property belongs to the city.
5741720	5743480	No one's allowed in, didn't you know?
5745400	5746680	Or are you up to something?
5748360	5751160	A bunch of people have been coming here on dares since it's haunted.
5752120	5753160	You aren't one of them, are you?
5757000	5757640	It's haunted?
5759000	5759880	Oh, give me a second.
5760680	5763400	Um, it's haunted?
5763400	5765000	Oh, I didn't know that.
5765000	5766040	Damn, is it haunted?
5767320	5769160	Oh, that's what the rumors are saying anyway.
5769160	5770040	It's just a great pain.
5773720	5774840	Oh, he nods in agreement.
5775400	5778600	It is pretty famous after all.
5779800	5780680	The guard sighs.
5783960	5787080	Anyway, the school is off limits, so you can't go inside.
5788920	5790680	I don't want any trouble on my first shift here.
5790680	5791240	Please leave.
5793240	5793800	You know.
5794360	5794680	Okay.
5796600	5797240	You know.
5799800	5800840	I'm muttering to himself.
5800840	5802680	The guard makes his way into the school.
5805480	5809480	As we watch him leave, Moe leans over and whispers.
5810520	5813480	Damn, it wasn't a guard when I stuck in here before.
5814520	5815480	I did not get caught.
5818840	5819960	Moving around a haunt.
5820600	5821320	Use the...
5822920	5824040	Lease keys to move.
5824920	5827640	The map shows which way you're facing and where you can go.
5829800	5830280	All right.
5833240	5833720	Let's go.
5835400	5835900	Oh.
5837080	5839240	Pushing open the doors I head inside.
5841640	5842840	Oh, it's so dark.
5843960	5845160	I can't see anything like this.
5846440	5848200	The moonlight doesn't reach inside.
5848200	5849720	We'll have to use the flashlight.
5851160	5853880	But if we use the flashlight, that guard will find us.
5854840	5856760	And do anything about it, I guess.
5857640	5858680	Anyway, that mirror is...
5859800	5862280	I'm pretty sure it's on the right.
5862920	5864280	To the right on the staircase.
5865480	5865980	Okay.
5869160	5870120	Instagating a haunt.
5870920	5872840	Move the L to search the current area.
5873560	5875800	Shine the flashlight in areas of interest and press A.
5877000	5878680	Pressing B ends the search.
5879720	5880920	Using the pad.
5882680	5883640	The search and move.
5890920	5892520	Um, look.
5893240	5897480	Do not leave hand prints in the mirror in the eastern staircase.
5897480	5897880	Thank you.
5898920	5900360	Independent research presentation.
5900360	5901160	First floor.
5901160	5902280	Multi-purpose classroom.
5902280	5903000	Come check it out.
5904200	5905960	Wow, that presentation takes me back.
5907640	5910520	Anyway, the mirror is on the eastern staircase.
5910520	5911320	It's the one I saw.
5912520	5914360	Guess we'll go there first.
5915240	5916360	Yeah, it's to the right.
5917480	5918840	Let me investigate, bish.
5920520	5922200	Yo, I turn over the torn flyer.
5923480	5925640	And I don't find anything in particular.
5927720	5928680	Nothing's there, huh?
5930840	5931880	Nothing's there, huh?
5931880	5932520	Looks like it.
5934680	5935180	Cool.
5939480	5940280	Um, and...
5943000	5943560	Anything else?
5943560	5943880	Ooh!
5945800	5950360	There are platforms of broken wooden slats in front of this true rock.
5950920	5952200	They creak when we step on them.
5953400	5953960	Record?
5958440	5958920	Uh...
5962920	5963640	Oh, that's one.
5965000	5965960	Half torn poster.
5966520	5970280	Says lost and found in large letters at the top.
5970280	5973000	Look, lost items are kept in the storage in the staff room.
5973560	5975000	Please check if you're missing something.
5977000	5977480	Deal.
5978040	5979000	Touch the paper.
5979000	5979880	It disintegrates.
5979960	5983800	Second, my fingers reach it and scatters through the air.
5984520	5985800	Nothing else looks interesting.
5989080	5992040	Okay, anything else we can look at?
5994760	5997480	The ceiling is filthy and the fluorescent lights are broken.
6001880	6003000	All right, I think that's it.
6005240	6006040	Went to the right.
6006920	6007420	Huh?
6012920	6016200	As we enter the hallway, a small shadow flits across our feet.
6017320	6019800	Turn the flashlight and find.
6021640	6022680	Huh? A bunny!
6022680	6023480	It's so cute!
6028360	6028860	Huh.
6030840	6031560	A bunny!
6031560	6037720	What's... is it the school pet?
6038840	6041320	Uh, how long has the school been closed for?
6041320	6042200	I don't think so.
6043400	6044360	I don't think so.
6044360	6045720	I don't think the banyoumi's there.
6046280	6050360	Chibi's more of a blonde bunny.
6051560	6053560	Is the bunny from Ghost Stories?
6055000	6055720	Touch me.
6055720	6056520	Touch me harder.
6061560	6068840	The black rabbit squeaks and runs away.
6069880	6072040	It rushes towards the eastern end of the school.
6074760	6076280	Ah, I ran away.
6076280	6077560	Is it telling us to follow?
6078280	6079320	Haha, you're right.
6080920	6083080	New info was added to the spirit file.
6083080	6083720	Black rabbit.
6087800	6088920	Uh, spooky.
6089880	6092360	It looks like something smashed the fluorescent lights.
6092360	6094200	Their shadowed beyond repair.
6099160	6100600	Should we go into the classroom?
6108760	6109480	I'm gonna do it.
6111320	6112600	Maybe we can find something cool.
6116040	6117080	It's abandoned desk.
6118920	6120280	On desk is slightly rusty.
6122760	6124600	Turn the desk around and stick my hand inside.
6125560	6128040	Got a holy, holy hard hat.
6129400	6130840	I doubt that's very useful.
6130840	6132120	I doubt that's very useful.
6132840	6133560	You never know.
6135480	6137400	The dust is thick on the ceiling.
6137400	6140520	That just walking around causes a shower of particles.
6145320	6146760	I think that's it in this room.
6149240	6149640	I can't.
6161640	6162440	Moved forward.
6165480	6165960	Down here.
6166680	6167560	Seems to be locked.
6171640	6174280	Broken window is letting in a piercingly cold wind.
6179720	6181560	The door is locked.
6182440	6183080	Locked door.
6195400	6198280	I wonder if we could wrench it open by sticking the letter opening into the hole.
6199560	6201400	Give it a try, but it won't even fit inside.
6202360	6203720	Wow, so uncool.
6204520	6205400	Put the fuck up!
6209880	6212200	The floor tile is upheeled off, leaving bare concrete.
6213480	6214760	I wonder if I can just peel around.
6216760	6217960	Keyhole isn't rusted over.
6217960	6219240	If I had a key, I could open it.
6221560	6222040	Okay.
6227320	6230040	What platform did you first play this on, Mercy?
6230040	6230840	Um...
6233080	6233720	PS4.
6235400	6235800	I think.
6239000	6241080	The fire door is rusted shut and won't move.
6244440	6244840	Hi.
6247960	6248760	Shut the fuck up!
6250760	6253000	That's my job!
6262280	6263160	Climb the stairs.
6266600	6268200	Don't copy me stinking.
6269480	6273480	Stinking ghost.
6279560	6280120	This is it.
6280840	6282840	The mirror I saw last time, I'm sure of it.
6284120	6284520	Huh?
6286520	6288520	Just then a dull pain runs through my wrists.
6290440	6292600	Like something is biting into my skin.
6294280	6297000	To distract myself from the pain.
6297960	6299240	I keep talking with Moe.
6302040	6303560	Certainly looks normal.
6305720	6307320	Yeah, what should we do?
6313160	6315240	I feel like I should save.
6315880	6327160	I suddenly face the mirror, bringing my face up to it.
6329160	6330840	Into its cloudy surface.
6330840	6332520	As expected, I can't make anything else.
6333160	6336680	I see my own shadow reflected as a vague shadowy lump.
6338120	6339240	Shadow sways in the mirror.
6340280	6341720	At least that's what I thought at first.
6341720	6343800	I figured the shadow moved because I had.
6345720	6348680	The next time the shadow moves, a cold shiver runs down my spine.
6355720	6358520	That's not my shadow.
6359400	6362760	Okay, okay, you remember the story of Hanahiko, right?
6362760	6367960	We say no, you're not pretty, and we are not an adult.
6370200	6371160	Some things in the mirror.
6375240	6381480	Sorry, I'm going to try to do a Moe.
6384360	6385800	Moe yelps and steps back.
6388840	6390440	That confirms I'm not hallucinating.
6390440	6391640	There really is something in there.
6392920	6394440	Every muscle in my body locks.
6395000	6397160	Try to look away, but I can't even close my eyes.
6398280	6399400	Figure's mouth twists.
6400680	6402920	I don't know look, but I can't even close my eyes.
6406200	6407480	It opens his mouth.
6408280	6409880	An unvoiced pierces my ears.
6412520	6415000	Live or die.
6418120	6420120	Hey, am I pretty?
6427880	6429480	No, no, right?
6431320	6432200	Yes, safe!
6435720	6440680	Only I had that red stuff.
6443160	6443960	Can't see well.
6444680	6445400	You a grown-up?
6446200	6447880	No, no, I'm not a grown-up.
6447880	6448360	Uh-uh.
6453000	6453960	I'm the tallest in my class.
6453960	6465640	Big people aren't allowed in school.
6469560	6470840	Suddenly the mirror cracks.
6471800	6474440	I'm just, I was just pretty tall.
6474440	6478680	Actually, oh no, no, no, I'm not going to tell the story.
6478680	6481800	I'm not going to tell the story because my senpais will make fun of me.
6482440	6488520	Suddenly the mirror cracks.
6492200	6493640	Big crack now.
6494600	6498680	I can't see no more big people here.
6501800	6502920	We would never.
6503800	6508200	Okay, so you know how I'm five, five, three in freedom units, right?
6509080	6509640	Okay, fine.
6509640	6510520	I'll tell the story.
6511400	6521480	So I stopped growing around fifth grade.
6524120	6527640	And I was the tallest in my class.
6528680	6530280	And I was so happy.
6530280	6533400	And then the following year, everyone shot way past me.
6533400	6536040	And I was like, oh, okay.
6540920	6549240	A brief fleeting moment of glory.
6549240	6550760	I was, I was the tallest.
6551640	6555880	And then I was not immediately after.
6560680	6562920	All right, the figure disappears.
6564520	6565080	Survived.
6565960	6566460	Whew.
6569080	6571000	The scream echoes from the other side of the school.
6572760	6573960	Moe sinks to the floor.
6576120	6578200	The gasping panic disbelief for a while.
6578200	6579160	I feel much the same.
6580360	6581480	What was that?
6583320	6585960	Probably an ahiqo.
6587800	6588760	I couldn't say it.
6588760	6591160	The words stuck in my throat.
6591720	6593000	My mouth is completely dry.
6595080	6595800	I can't believe this.
6595800	6599640	I, I thought I wanted to see a ghost.
6609880	6611960	But just see one that clearly.
6617960	6620840	I got a moment to feel that I was the tallest.
6621560	6624520	Yeah, hydration check.
6624520	6625160	Thank you.
6626760	6628120	Wait, are you saying that to Moe?
6631480	6632600	Well, excuse me.
6632600	6633720	What about mercy?
6641560	6644680	Moe seems to shake the encounter off and return to normal.
6645640	6648120	An ahiqo's words swirl in my head.
6649000	6654040	Our situation has done a complete reverse from where we were just a moment ago.
6654040	6657080	I can't believe I was complaining about not knowing what to investigate.
6658360	6661720	Oh, anyway, scream.
6661720	6662440	What was that?
6663560	6665560	A guard we met outside.
6678120	6679640	I'm going to let that pass.
6680840	6682520	For now, then bye.
6684040	6685560	I doubt there's anyone else here.
6685560	6686840	You might have seen something.
6686840	6687880	Wherever he is too.
6688520	6689880	Sounded like it came from far away.
6691000	6692200	A ways down the hallway.
6693080	6694200	Be the other side of the school.
6696120	6697160	Yeah, let's look for him.
6697880	6698840	If he screamed like that.
6699880	6701000	Something might have happened to him.
6702840	6705640	Right as I respond, hear someone whisper in my ear.
6709080	6709960	A pair of eyes.
6711080	6711560	Hold on.
6712120	6713720	A pair of eyes with red.
6719080	6722440	I look in the direction of the voice, but all I see is darkness.
6723720	6724200	Mystery?
6725480	6726760	No, it's nothing.
6729000	6729480	Let's go.
6731960	6734120	New info was added to the spirit file.
6734120	6735640	An ahiqo, the boy in the mirror.
6738120	6745000	Can I go up here?
6747320	6748520	Climbed the stairs.
6751000	6752840	Climbed up the stairs to the second floor.
6755800	6757720	I guess something soft squished under my heel.
6758920	6761800	Could I pick up my foot and shine the light down?
6761800	6763640	Oh, that's a lot of snacks.
6763960	6764440	Snacks.
6766440	6767320	Snacks, snacks.
6767320	6768360	So many snacks.
6769160	6771080	Hallways covered with poisonous snakes.
6772760	6773320	Come on, wait.
6774600	6777080	Let's have something close to a streak upon seeing them.
6778440	6779800	Eats and snakes!
6781880	6783320	Decided to go back to the landing.
6788600	6789320	Oh, let's go.
6790840	6791880	Went down the stairs.
6794520	6799560	I think we looked at these places.
6803480	6804760	A bird breaks the silence.
6804760	6806520	Like there's a crow or something outside.
6807800	6808680	Don't spook me now!
6811400	6812040	Oh, shut up.
6823640	6834600	It needs to be locked.
6845720	6848200	Lights on the ceilings are silent and dark without power.
6849720	6850600	Entered the left room.
6850600	6854280	I don't know what that fucking says.
6856520	6860440	There are nonsense scribbles on the blackboard.
6863480	6864360	There's a hole in the wall.
6865240	6869160	Yeah, stick my arm in, but the hole gets narrow and further I go in and can't reach
6869160	6869720	what's inside.
6871480	6871880	Tool.
6872440	6873080	Fire opener.
6873800	6877400	Pick the lever opener in the hole and scrape out the item though, second side.
6878600	6880200	A worn out talisman.
6880280	6881880	And I pick up the worn out talisman.
6881880	6883560	I feel warmth flow through me.
6885400	6886360	Oh, soul power.
6887560	6890040	A worn out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.
6891320	6894280	Find a worn out talisman to restore your soul power.
6894840	6898760	The more soul power you have, the easier it will be to survive a deadly choice.
6902440	6903640	Got an achievement for that.
6906360	6907240	An abandoned desk.
6907880	6911000	Yo, stick my hand inside and feel around.
6911880	6912920	A plastic bottle.
6914040	6915240	There's nothing in the bottle.
6916120	6917560	Oh, it might come in handy.
6919800	6921640	Senpai, are you scared?
6932120	6933560	I can't remember which way I'm going.
6938200	6942520	I hear a noise like something slamming against the door.
6944520	6945560	Is someone inside?
6948280	6949640	And the flashlight at the door.
6953480	6955560	No, not the security guard.
6959800	6960120	Yeah.
6960440	6967480	I don't know where the door bursts open and something comes flying out.
6972680	6973960	Moe shrieks and falls down.
6975080	6976200	I recognize those clothes.
6977880	6980200	Some kind of plant covers half his face.
6981000	6985160	The part of his face we can see is twisted in anguish as he screams.
6985800	6987560	No doubt about it, it's that guard.
6988920	6989720	How happened?
6991400	6993320	They're eating my face!
6997800	6998520	It hurts.
6998520	6999560	What's going on?
7001640	7002120	Uh-uh.
7003400	7003960	I'm sorry.
7003960	7004440	I'm sorry.
7004440	7004920	I'm sorry.
7004920	7005400	I'm sorry.
7005400	7005960	I'm sorry.
7005960	7006440	I'm sorry.
7006440	7006920	I'm sorry.
7006920	7007400	I'm sorry.
7007400	7007960	I'm sorry.
7007960	7008440	I'm sorry.
7008440	7008920	I'm sorry.
7008920	7009560	I'm sorry.
7010440	7012920	Moe sits on the floor, stunned into syllable.
7020760	7022680	The guards only rushes towards the entrance.
7024680	7026600	And then silence falls once more.
7033000	7036040	The only sound left is that of her shaky breathing.
7040440	7044760	Once we catch her breath, take Moe's hand and help them up.
7046360	7050200	Her nerves have calmed some, but that definitely left an unsettling impression.
7054040	7055800	Something terrible lurks here.
7055800	7056680	Can't just sit around.
7058760	7060360	I felt like I was paralyzed.
7062760	7063720	I'm okay now.
7065160	7066520	Mr. That Guy.
7066520	7069960	I'm always stares at the door.
7071720	7074680	I wonder if Anahiko did that.
7077400	7082840	And I don't know if you noticed, but I got the feeling someone was standing behind him.
7084520	7086600	There's really no good way to respond to that.
7087400	7089480	I let silence serve as my answer.
7091160	7092040	What else could I do?
7092760	7097800	No point in coming here for just going to stand here shaking.
7099080	7102040	Don't uncover the secret before it comes for us.
7103560	7104680	Let me check out the staff room.
7106360	7108200	Actually avoid answering Moe's question.
7109320	7110920	Guard had run out of here.
7110920	7112040	Something might be inside.
7112040	7113560	Some secret about Anahiko.
7115000	7116120	Yeah, yeah.
7117400	7117880	You're right.
7119480	7120680	Just be careful, okay?
7122200	7125960	I cover my wrist with my palm, making sure Moe doesn't miss.
7127720	7129480	The moment I put my hand on the knob,
7130520	7134360	a mark burned my skin, pulsing along with my beating heart.
7138040	7140680	New info is added to the spirit file.
7140680	7141640	Time to fight guard.
7145960	7146440	All right.
7149480	7149960	Record?
7152920	7158040	Let's check the memo out.
7158040	7158760	Anahiko?
7160360	7163800	A mysterious backrabbit appeared in front of us out of nowhere.
7163800	7167000	It's funny, but we've encountered so many strange things already.
7167000	7169000	And an odd bunny doesn't faze me at all.
7169000	7171640	Though this paralyzing dread might be concerning anyway.
7172280	7173480	Might be a bit concerning.
7173480	7175480	Anyway, first we have to find that mirror.
7177160	7178600	Anahiko with the boy in the mirror.
7179080	7181320	Like the rumor said, Gassley Boy appeared.
7181320	7184520	We answered some of his questions, then the mirror broke and he vanished.
7186520	7188760	No more big people here, he said.
7188760	7192200	Like who is chasing something, then we heard a horrible scream.
7192200	7194440	Came from the opposite end of the school.
7194440	7195800	It sounded familiar.
7197560	7198920	The mysteries didn't end there.
7198920	7200920	I heard a whisper in my ear and said,
7201720	7202760	Purify with red.
7203720	7205320	What was that eerie voice?
7205320	7206760	Maybe something was...
7206840	7208360	Maybe something was...
7208360	7209080	That's going on.
7209080	7211080	It's making me go crazy.
7211640	7214760	Regardless, we first need to find the true cause of that scream.
7215960	7218920	The guard we met at the school gate was the one who screamed.
7219640	7222840	Burst out of the staff room covered in growing plants of all things.
7223400	7224920	The pain was driving him mad.
7225480	7226520	The spirit do this?
7227480	7229000	It must have been Anahiko.
7229000	7229560	Which means...
7231400	7234040	Inside the staff room is what we have to keep going.
7234040	7239240	Okay, are you ready senpai?
7241160	7242200	I feel like I'm gonna piss.
7247560	7248920	The staff room is in chaos.
7250920	7253480	Furniture is upended and the walls are...
7254840	7256360	Is there a fire here or something?
7256840	7258680	There are black scorch marks everywhere.
7260680	7261180	Yeah.
7261960	7264280	Boy, it looks relieved as they come out from behind me.
7265800	7267240	Well, totally empty.
7270280	7271640	Anyway, let's look around.
7274680	7275880	There's a door here too.
7275880	7277080	It's like it goes to another room.
7278040	7279320	I search the burnt posts.
7279320	7281320	Something falls from the top of it.
7281880	7283640	It's bound to Warn out Talisman.
7283640	7286680	I pick up the Warn out Talisman and feel a warmth flow through me.
7288360	7289480	Got the soul power.
7291000	7293240	Warn out Talisman crumbles silently in my hand.
7297960	7299400	I think there's nothing else to do.
7303160	7304440	I think there's something else.
7304440	7311440	I think there's nothing else here, just here, walls near the window is burnt, there must
7311440	7315440	have been a fire here a long time ago.
7315440	7320440	Open the door and left the staff room.
7320440	7324440	I cramped in here.
7324440	7327440	Is this a storage room?
7327440	7328440	Seems?
7328440	7330440	It seems to be.
7330440	7337440	Hopefully there's something useful here.
7337440	7341440	There's a massive wooden cabinet.
7341440	7346440	It's really old, the corners of the doors are rounded off.
7346440	7348440	It's all in the door but just rattles in place.
7348440	7350440	Looks like it will open.
7350440	7355440	Something's stopping it.
7355440	7357440	Take out the letter opener.
7357440	7358440	What do I do with it?
7358440	7364440	I don't have any particularly good ideas.
7364440	7367440	Your little shit.
7367440	7372440	That one actually spooked me a little.
7372440	7374440	That one actually spooked me a little.
7374440	7380440	Oh, I just realized I'm super far away.
7380440	7382440	I opened the last door and checked inside.
7382440	7384440	There isn't anything that catches my eyes.
7384440	7387440	That actually kind of spooked me a little.
7387440	7393440	Good thing I did kegels.
7393440	7395440	Open the last door and check inside.
7395440	7397440	But there isn't anything that catches my eye.
7397440	7410440	I went into super comfy mode and just leaned back.
7410440	7412440	I think it's a school journal.
7412440	7420440	The paper deteriorated from ages and bugs so I can't read it.
7420440	7423440	There's a door cut in the floor.
7423440	7425440	Is it some kind of storage area?
7425440	7427440	A little bit.
7427440	7431440	Built door big enough to fit an adult through.
7431440	7432440	Feel?
7432440	7435440	My little head always retracted into the door.
7435440	7437440	I had to get a grasp on it and pull it out
7437440	7442440	but I am unsuccessful.
7442440	7444440	Letter opener again.
7444440	7445440	Easy, letter opener.
7445440	7447440	I might be able to pull the handle out.
7447440	7450440	Spot down by the door.
7450440	7460440	My mark bites into my wrists again.
7460440	7465440	It's almost like it's trying to stop me from searching under the floor.
7465440	7468440	Stand up pretending to be calm.
7468440	7470440	Hey, that's worrying.
7470440	7473440	I think dangerous must be here.
7473440	7474440	What's wrong?
7474440	7477440	Are you going to see what that is?
7477440	7482440	I'll check it out later.
7482440	7487440	Keep my reply big as I dust off my knees.
7487440	7490440	Let's look around the room first.
7490440	7493440	There's a bunch of interesting stuff in here.
7493440	7494440	I have nothing.
7494440	7496440	It's something beneath our feet.
7496440	7503440	We better make sure we're prepared for going down there.
7503440	7506440	Can I shake it more?
7506440	7512440	I feel it on the door but it just rattles in place.
7512440	7523440	Look.
7523440	7525440	I don't see it anywhere.
7525440	7527440	What's this?
7527440	7530440	Something stuck in the hole for the screw.
7530440	7535440	Seems that wooden thing works as a lock.
7535440	7538440	I have to do something about that to open the door.
7538440	7539440	Seriously?
7539440	7541440	I used the letter opener before?
7541440	7546440	I might be able to pop out whatever stuck in the hole.
7546440	7549440	That's the idea at least.
7549440	7551440	I hope it won't fit at all.
7551440	7553440	The knife is too big.
7553440	7558440	What else can I use?
7558440	7561440	Open the last door and check inside.
7561440	7567440	There isn't anything that catches my eye.
7567440	7569440	Anything else?
7569440	7571440	Oh, there's a box up there.
7571440	7574440	That's the cardboard box on top of the cabinet.
7574440	7576440	I think I can reach it.
7576440	7579440	Something's written on the marker at the side of the box.
7579440	7584440	Austin is legible but the rest of the letter smudged.
7584440	7586440	I feel.
7586440	7589440	Yep, I grabbed the box and looked inside.
7589440	7593440	Got lipstick, red pen, and girl slippers.
7593440	7594440	Good job, mister.
7594440	7597440	I knew there was a reason you were tall.
7597440	7601440	Shit.
7601440	7602440	Now that means...
7602440	7603440	Oops!
7603440	7606440	That's the wrong thing.
7606440	7608440	Examined first.
7608440	7609440	Tools.
7609440	7613440	Maybe I can use the red pen?
7613440	7614440	Take out the red pen.
7614440	7615440	I used the pen.
7615440	7619440	I might be able to pop open whatever's inside the hole.
7619440	7620440	Wow.
7620440	7629440	You've got skills.
7629440	7631440	Is that surprising?
7631440	7636440	Well, I need to focus.
7636440	7637440	Friendly.
7637440	7641440	Resistance vanishes and the pen pokes all the way through.
7641440	7645440	Hold my hand on the door and slide it open without any issue.
7645440	7647440	It's a red tube inside.
7647440	7650440	Got flair.
7650440	7651440	A flair?
7651440	7653440	What's that for?
7653440	7656440	I mean, you don't know what a flair is.
7656440	7660440	Also, the next book I may need to go potty.
7660440	7666440	It's a signal light for an emergency.
7666440	7669440	It's a good idea to always have one in your car.
7669440	7671440	Oh, okay then.
7671440	7676440	But, Moe, I picked something off the floor.
7676440	7677440	The thorn.
7677440	7681440	As long as my pinky finger.
7681440	7684440	That's what was in the hole.
7684440	7686440	I don't mean time call.
7686440	7687440	I'm a little nervous.
7687440	7688440	Not gonna lie.
7688440	7690440	I'm not gonna lie.
7690440	7693440	I'm a little nervous.
7693440	7698440	This is so not a coincidence.
7698440	7700440	Bet he didn't want anyone to have that.
7700440	7703440	Put a thorn in the hole.
7703440	7710440	Is he scared of this?
7710440	7717440	You both look at the flair again.
7717440	7726440	Why did you turn off the light?
7726440	7729440	That wasn't me.
7729440	7733440	I didn't turn it off, it just went off.
7733440	7735440	What was that noise?
7735440	7737440	Hey mister, what was that noise?
7737440	7740440	Shh, be quiet.
7740440	7742440	Struggling not to yell with my nerves on edge.
7742440	7745440	I hit the flashlight again and again.
7745440	7747440	Come on, please.
7747440	7750440	The batteries were just working.
7750440	7754440	I feel like I'm performing CPR on this thing.
7754440	7757440	Finally.
7757440	7761440	Got it.
7761440	7765440	Door behind me warps threateningly.
7765440	7773440	I mark burns and pain.
7773440	7776440	Get this already in the room next door.
7776440	7780440	There's no time and nowhere to run.
7780440	7781440	Calm down.
7781440	7783440	We find a way out of this quickly.
7783440	7784440	We're running out of time.
7784440	7792440	We did survive, but got to hurry.
7792440	7794440	I cut the letter opener and shoved it in.
7794440	7796440	I might be able to get the handle out this way.
7796440	7799440	I touched the metal, my mark scored.
7799440	7801440	Not moving for just a second.
7801440	7804440	But I have to do this.
7804440	7805440	Yeah, I got it.
7805440	7808440	I grabbed the handle and lift up the trapdoor.
7808440	7811440	I thought a dark hole leads down under the floor.
7811440	7813440	Get in!
7813440	7815440	I shove Moe into the hole.
7815440	7822440	And I slide down into the darkness after them.
7822440	7827440	Ah!
7827440	7831440	I fall unexpectedly far, hitting my head.
7831440	7834440	Hitting my back against something.
7834440	7842440	Get my teeth to stop myself from yelling.
7842440	7846440	Something shuffling above my head.
7846440	7852440	If we had just stayed there just a few more seconds.
7852440	7855440	I grip my burning wrist with all my might.
7855440	7862440	I must endure the pain for now.
7862440	7864440	I can hear anxious panting.
7864440	7867440	Moe must be right next to me.
7867440	7872440	Making so hard, I can see it from the corner of my eye.
7872440	7879440	I brace myself, expecting the trapdoor to break open any second.
7879440	7881440	The shuffling noise.
7881440	7886440	It only grows distant.
7886440	7889440	Is it okay now?
7889440	7891440	Yeah.
7891440	7894440	I think it's gone.
7894440	7900440	Suddenly my wrist isn't hurting anymore.
7900440	7904440	Thank God, I thought we were done for this time.
7904440	7908440	Anyway, where are we?
7908440	7911440	Where in the world is this room?
7911440	7915440	I'm surprised this place exists beneath the school.
7915440	7918440	Can you turn on the light?
7918440	7920440	Yeah.
7920440	7927440	I cautiously press the switch, being careful not to make any noise.
7927440	7931440	Girls.
7931440	7940440	The scene captured in the light of the flashlight sends shivers down my spine.
7940440	7948440	Moe slaps a hand over her mouth.
7948440	7955440	In a few moments, all we can do is stare in silence.
7955440	7960440	It's sort of pretty with the flowers, I guess.
7960440	7970440	A disturbing scene, more horrible than anything I've ever seen before, spread out before us.
7970440	7975440	Anyone would be shocked by it, especially a kid.
7975440	7978440	I take a deep breath and look closer.
7978440	7981440	There's something twisting around the corpse.
7981440	7986440	It's like some kind of plant vine.
7986440	7991440	Those roses?
7991440	7997440	The strangely sharp thorns and the thin red petals.
7997440	8000440	They appear to be real.
8000440	8007440	Five roses covering the corpses and carpeting the floor.
8007440	8010440	My vision suddenly grows dim.
8011440	8016440	Ahh!
8016440	8022440	Ahh!
8022440	8026440	Ahh!
8026440	8029440	Don't look, Senpai! Don't look! Don't look!
8029440	8031440	Don't look!
8031440	8036440	I know! Don't look!
8036440	8039440	Don't look, Senpai!
8041440	8048440	Don't look!
8048440	8057440	I see a woman's body trapped by roses.
8057440	8066440	What? What is this?
8066440	8069440	The tragedy that happened in this room.
8069440	8075440	Don't look, Senpai!
8075440	8078440	As if it's all playing out in my head.
8078440	8086440	I can see it.
8086440	8096440	Girls? Girlses? What are they doing here?
8096440	8098440	Did someone plant them?
8098440	8100440	Okay.
8100440	8103440	You're safe, Senpai. Senpai.
8103440	8110440	I think you can look again.
8110440	8116440	Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
8116440	8125440	Moe's voice brings me back to reality.
8125440	8127440	Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
8127440	8131440	Always protecting Senpai. Always protecting Senpai.
8141440	8146440	No ogling!
8146440	8150440	Yeah. I can't tell them what I...
8150440	8153440	I can't tell them that I saw some waking dream.
8153440	8155440	I scrambled to remember the conversation.
8155440	8159440	That's right. I saw the rose vines then.
8159440	8161440	It's got to be it.
8161440	8167440	It's not like they're just bringing up on their own.
8168440	8170440	Why would anyone do that?
8170440	8172440	Did someone decorate the corpse?
8172440	8175440	Is this for some kind of reason?
8175440	8179440	Did they die captured by the roses like I saw in the vision?
8183440	8185440	Moe screams.
8185440	8188440	What's wrong? What's wrong?
8188440	8191440	Something moved. See?
8191440	8196440	Over there! Back in there!
8196440	8204440	It's something hiding in here.
8204440	8206440	Mattress is completely discolored.
8206440	8209440	It's stained with something that looks like sweat.
8209440	8215440	Someone must have been living here for a long time, too.
8215440	8219440	Too old.
8219440	8220440	Letter opener?
8220440	8222440	It got the letter opener.
8222440	8225440	What do I do with it? I don't have any in particular!
8225440	8227440	Fuck! Do I just feel?
8227440	8230440	Mattress is oozing dark, dirty water.
8230440	8233440	Smells like sewage.
8233440	8237440	Slide the mattress over and find a plastic sheet underneath it.
8237440	8239440	Got a vinyl sheet!
8239440	8241440	Pretty thick.
8241440	8245440	Was it put there to protect from water damage?
8245440	8247440	Off of the sheet is pitch black.
8247440	8251440	At first glance, it looks like it's covered in mold.
8251440	8256440	I spread it open. It crunches as dark red flakes fall from it.
8256440	8258440	This is blood.
8258440	8263440	One endowed knife! I'm just going to point a knife at it!
8263440	8268440	Can't do anything, but whisper dumbfounded as I stare at the bloodstained sheet.
8268440	8274440	I think murmurs in my ear as I reply.
8274440	8283440	Their blood denies him.
8283440	8285440	Part of me takes the voice seriously.
8285440	8289440	I'm clearly hallucinating, but for some reason calms me down.
8289440	8294440	So in days, I shine the flashlight under the bed.
8294440	8297440	There it is again! Something's there!
8297440	8300440	Chloe's voice has gone very shrill.
8300440	8302440	What happened?
8302440	8305440	Hey, now. Give me a break.
8305440	8307440	I'm no monster, you know.
8307440	8310440	A regular human being.
8310440	8313440	Who are you?
8313440	8316440	Wait, I remember you. No, I remember you. I remember you.
8316440	8318440	I remember you. I remember you.
8318440	8320440	Nope, I remember you.
8320440	8323440	I play this far. Yeah. Wait, I remember you.
8323440	8328440	It's fine. It's fine. Who are you?
8328440	8332440	This is why I grabbed the knife.
8332440	8335440	Something slowly climbs out from under the bed.
8335440	8340440	It's a man in a trench coat.
8340440	8346440	A person? What were you doing under there?
8346440	8349440	The man looks bored. He scoffs.
8349440	8351440	The same as you.
8351440	8354440	And that monster escaped down here.
8354440	8357440	And you guys came.
8357440	8361440	The man turns his back to us and jerks his chin.
8361440	8364440	Anyhow, I was hiding over there.
8364440	8370440	His answer is believable enough.
8370440	8373440	But why is he at the school to begin with?
8373440	8377440	His presence raises a lot of questions.
8377440	8382440	The man tilts his head a bit and peers at me and snorts.
8382440	8384440	He seems through me.
8384440	8387440	You don't look like you believe...
8387440	8389440	You don't look like you believe me.
8389440	8391440	I guess that's only natural.
8391440	8394440	I haven't told you everything either.
8394440	8397440	I could, but...
8397440	8400440	The man looks around at his feet.
8400440	8402440	Better get out of here first.
8402440	8405440	I shouldn't chat at a crime scene.
8405440	8407440	I think you're right.
8407440	8411440	Oh, he seems to feel the same way.
8411440	8414440	Let's head back for now.
8414440	8418440	You have somewhere to go back to? Good.
8418440	8421440	Then let's get going.
8421440	8423440	The man puts his hand on the ladder.
8423440	8426440	He pauses and turns to us.
8426440	8429440	The name's Satoru Mashita.
8429440	8432440	I'm an ex-detective.
8432440	8434440	I forgot to mention that.
8434440	8440440	The man named Mashita disappears up the ladder.
8440440	8443440	We follow him back up to the first floor.
8443440	8447440	But when we emerge, he's not there.
8447440	8450440	Hey, take a look at this.
8450440	8455440	Mashita's calling us from down the hallway.
8455440	8458440	Was it like this when you guys came through?
8458440	8462440	Oh, he pipes up, voice slightly wobbly.
8462440	8464440	No, it wasn't.
8464440	8467440	It wasn't like this at all.
8471440	8474440	Something's creeping along the hallway.
8474440	8477440	The rose finds.
8477440	8479440	Not so.
8479440	8482440	I didn't see them before either.
8486440	8489440	Oh, ow!
8489440	8492440	The mark's color grow more vivid.
8492440	8496440	Early dawn, a few hours left until death closes in.
8500440	8514440	Some people naturally put others on guard,
8514440	8517440	even if there's no particular ill will between them.
8517440	8521440	It's exactly the type of person Mashita is.
8524440	8527440	Oh, you've got nice stuff here.
8527440	8530440	The moment he climbs in the car, he makes a grab for my bag,
8530440	8533440	and he starts inspecting all of my stuff.
8533440	8536440	I wasn't planning on keeping a constant eye on him,
8536440	8539440	but he's making it very hard not to.
8539440	8542440	Oh, he seems like the type to stick her nose in everything,
8542440	8547440	but he's suspiciously silent as if exhausted.
8547440	8549440	Are you okay, Moe?
8549440	8553440	Huh? Oh, yeah, just zoning out, you know?
8553440	8556440	I'm fine.
8556440	8563440	He doesn't look fine, but my other passenger is of more concern right now.
8563440	8568440	So, were you at the school because you were investigating something?
8568440	8574440	I'm not on the force anymore, just poking around for my own reasons.
8574440	8577440	Something I wanted to check.
8577440	8582440	I don't doubt what he says, but that would mean he entered the school illegally.
8583440	8585440	What were you?
8585440	8588440	Let me ask one thing first.
8588440	8593440	Mashita interrupts my question and points to my arm.
8593440	8597440	Does that hurt?
8597440	8601440	It doesn't take him long to spot the mark on my wrist.
8601440	8606440	Sometimes it hurts the most whenever I'm in danger.
8606440	8610440	Huh, is that so?
8610440	8614440	Mashita leans back in his seat, satisfied.
8614440	8618440	I was investigating some missing people.
8618440	8621440	Guess he's responding to my question now.
8621440	8625440	That school came up with a number of missing persons cases.
8625440	8630440	Each one had some affiliation with age elementary before they disappeared.
8630440	8634440	Teachers, workers, people in the BTA, students and their family members.
8634440	8636440	I was looking for them.
8636440	8639440	Then...
8639440	8642440	Moe speaks up from the back seat.
8642440	8644440	Are those people?
8644440	8647440	The corpses down there?
8647440	8650440	Doesn't sound as energetic as she usually did.
8650440	8653440	Does something happen after all?
8653440	8655440	Is her mark?
8655440	8657440	Mashita doesn't reply.
8657440	8662440	Maybe he thinks the answer is obvious, or maybe replying to a kid isn't worth his time.
8662440	8665440	Something bugs me about what he just said.
8665440	8668440	The school was clearly suspicious then.
8668440	8671440	Of course, I brought it up to my superiors.
8671440	8674440	All I got for it was...
8674440	8680440	Continues before I can ask, making a slashing motion across his neck.
8680440	8683440	You got fired, huh?
8683440	8691440	Disciplinary discharge, something about sexually harassing us, so burden it!
8691440	8699440	That principal's gotta get some kind of pull, gotta have some kind of political pull.
8699440	8705440	I probably dug up something he didn't want to get out.
8705440	8711440	That wasn't my plan, I never meant to uncover anything dirty.
8711440	8715440	True, the school did have that suspicious room.
8715440	8720440	Not that strange to think it would come up in some missing persons cases.
8720440	8723440	That would be common sense at least.
8723440	8727440	Common sense is for the world of the living.
8727440	8734440	The spirit might have something to do with those cases.
8734440	8738440	There's an awkward silence.
8738440	8743440	In that sense, this isn't even a case anymore, is it?
8743440	8746440	I should just size deeply.
8746440	8748440	I would believe it.
8748440	8751440	I would believe that there's a monster in that school killing people.
8751440	8754440	It's personal now.
8754440	8756440	Our problem.
8756440	8758440	And we're on our own.
8758440	8761440	He turns his wrist over and shows it to me.
8761440	8766440	On his skin is the familiar mark.
8767440	8771440	Yeah, I sensed it as soon as I saw yours.
8771440	8774440	I had a feeling this would be a problem.
8774440	8777440	We're in the same boat, you and I.
8777440	8781440	He's got good instincts.
8781440	8784440	We should talk more when we get back.
8784440	8787440	At Kujo Mansion, there's some...
8787440	8789440	Stopped myself from finishing my sentence.
8789440	8792440	I shouldn't mention that for now.
8792440	8797440	In any case, once we get back, we'll give you more details.
8797440	8802440	Yeah, I'm sure they'll help him a bunch.
8802440	8804440	Yeah, I'll share that to help him a bunch.
8804440	8809440	Who the fuck said that?
8809440	8813440	I might as she takes off.
8813440	8814440	Is that Moe?
8814440	8817440	So hard when all of them are in the same color.
8817440	8821440	Yeah, she did help him a lot.
8821440	8822440	Help, huh?
8822440	8825440	You're underestimating me.
8831440	8833440	Who the do's a pale or an orange?
8833440	8838440	You think I can tell the difference?
8838440	8842440	When I got out from the car,
8842440	8844440	someone's there to keep me.
8844440	8846440	Welcome back, mister.
8846440	8847440	You too, Miss Moe.
8847440	8849440	Well, you're unharmed.
8849440	8852440	Any clues about the spirit?
8852440	8854440	What?
8854440	8857440	So there's others.
8857440	8859440	This is everyone.
8859440	8864440	Huh, what a reliable group you've got.
8864440	8868440	The sarcasm is practically dripping off his words.
8868440	8871440	So...
8871440	8876440	Are you all planning to continue to search for that key or whatever it is?
8876440	8878440	I don't have anything to go on.
8878440	8880440	There's no other choice.
8880440	8882440	I don't understand you.
8882440	8885440	The source of the mark is the spirit.
8885440	8891440	It would be best to destroy the source, don't you think?
8891440	8893440	What do you mean?
8893440	8898440	The spirit exists, so all you have to do is kill it.
8898440	8902440	Are you serious?
8902440	8903440	Of course he's serious.
8903440	8906440	He doesn't exactly look like the joking type.
8906440	8910440	Even if we manage to kill it, will that really make the mark disappear?
8910440	8915440	When I considered everything Mary's told me, it doesn't look like it would work that way.
8915440	8920440	Even assuming it did would have a more fundamental problem.
8920440	8922440	How do you plan to kill it?
8922440	8925440	I'll figure something out.
8925440	8932440	If something exists, there's logically a way to destroy it as well.
8932440	8937440	He claims he can kill the spirit yet he doesn't even know how to do it.
8937440	8941440	This is all that confidence come from.
8941440	8945440	Don't forget, I faced him once already.
8945440	8948440	If we're seriously thinking of killing him.
8948440	8951440	Actually there are graphs as well.
8951440	8955440	A little shit took a shot.
8955440	8960440	Wow, these are hard to read. Hold on.
8960440	8964440	The little shit shot some kind of thorn at me from a distance.
8964440	8969440	Hit me hard enough to stick in concrete. No way to get close to him.
8969440	8972440	I have to make that a priority.
8972440	8976440	Mash it up, pull something out of the hue of his shoe and toss it to me.
8976440	8979440	The thorn curved like a thing.
8979440	8982440	The only reason I'm still breathing is because I was lucky.
8982440	8989440	It won't happen next time. We need a plan.
8989440	8992440	If we head to the entrance, I tell Mashita about Kujo Mansion.
8992440	8994440	He takes it all in silently.
8994440	8999440	Even bringing up the talking doll or Saiya Kujo's death doesn't trigger a reaction.
8999440	9003440	Why is he so unnervingly calm?
9003440	9009440	Because he's already dealt with the supernatural?
9009440	9013440	We reach the main hall which is warmly lit.
9013440	9018440	This is a strange mansion, but for some reason I feel like I've come home.
9019440	9028440	A climatization is kind of terrifying.
9028440	9032440	Welcome back, my darling.
9032440	9036440	That man is a markbearer too, I see.
9036440	9040440	Would you make the introductions?
9040440	9046440	I update Mary on our investigation in the strange way we met Mashita.
9046440	9050440	The mirror, the underground room full of corpses, the sudden appearance of roses.
9050440	9056440	I really hate to admit it, but it's clear something supernatural is at work.
9056440	9059440	And the spirit that is the cause of all of it?
9059440	9062440	Hanahiko.
9062440	9067440	There's no doubt that Hanahiko is the one who put the mark on Mashita's arm too.
9067440	9069440	But...
9069440	9075440	Stop flashbanging me!
9075440	9079440	What kind of chance do we have against a monster that can do that?
9079440	9082440	Weed killer, okay, you know what?
9082440	9085440	But are roses weeds?
9085440	9089440	I don't think so.
9089440	9092440	Mashita says we should kill him.
9092440	9096440	Is that even possible?
9096440	9099440	Hey, darling.
9099440	9101440	Sorry.
9101440	9104440	I didn't know who that was, so I was like...
9104440	9105440	Darling.
9105440	9115440	Okay, so now it's, hey, darling.
9115440	9117440	Oops, I dropped my bopple.
9117440	9125440	My little ice rollers.
9125440	9127440	My train of thought is interrupted.
9127440	9128440	I'm sorry.
9128440	9129440	I'm sorry.
9129440	9131440	I'm sorry, Senpai.
9131440	9133440	My fujiyo mind is racing.
9133440	9138440	I'm starting to make fan fiction in my head.
9138440	9141440	But then I remembered our protagonist is Senpai, so now I'm just like,
9141440	9151440	maybe I should scrap that idea.
9151440	9153440	My train of thought is interrupted.
9153440	9160440	Mashita's holding a leather-bound notebook out towards me.
9160440	9165440	Read this.
9165440	9168440	I picked it up in that underground room.
9168440	9172440	It was caught up in a bunch of those rose vines when I found it.
9172440	9175440	It was pretty hard to get loose.
9175440	9177440	Did you read it?
9177440	9179440	I skimmed through a bit.
9179440	9187440	It's got some interesting stuff.
9187440	9188440	I saw.
9188440	9189440	That's what he says.
9189440	9192440	But he's not smiling at all.
9192440	9194440	It's a shimmer.
9194440	9197440	A shimmer with a quiet anger.
9197440	9198440	I was like, shimmer.
9198440	9200440	No, that's not a shimmer.
9200440	9203440	Dark red mark staying the cover.
9203440	9206440	I have a bad feeling that I flipped through it.
9206440	9213440	Rose petals fall as they become unstuck from the pages.
9213440	9218440	The notes within are very detailed.
9218440	9222440	The author was intelligent and well-written.
9222440	9229440	Reading through it dawns on me that this was written by H. Elementary's principal.
9229440	9235440	The austere, meticulous letter on each page tell a ghastly story.
9235440	9243440	The skirts of a young, adopted boy's tutoring sessions.
9243440	9246440	The first note is from five years ago.
9246440	9252440	It seems the boy adopted by the principal was small and exceedingly cute.
9252440	9255440	He enjoyed wearing skirts and makeup too.
9255440	9260440	I was so denying that they truly suited a dainty red-cheeked boy like him.
9260440	9263440	But the principal had a hard time accepting such fancies.
9263440	9265440	Bad habits must be corrected.
9265440	9272440	Young must be corrected young to promote sound, mental and healthy thought.
9272440	9280440	So he called it tutoring as a cover for his warped desires.
9280440	9283440	They took place in the underground room.
9283440	9286440	Too many prying eyes anywhere else.
9286440	9290440	There was no safer place than the school at night.
9290440	9294440	Once all the teachers had left.
9294440	9301440	No! No!
9301440	9308440	The principal stayed behind under the pretense of keeping watch, then tutored.
9308440	9311440	He was a highly respected teacher.
9311440	9314440	He even made appearances on TV.
9314440	9319440	There's no reason to be suspicious.
9319440	9326440	The only one who noticed anything strange was the boy's homeroom teacher.
9326440	9337440	But she feared the principal's power and firmly kept her mouth shut.
9337440	9341440	As the notes continue, they are more and more deranged.
9341440	9343440	They paint a horrible picture.
9343440	9348440	It is of a totally distorted parent and child.
9348440	9351440	My child gets weaker after every session.
9351440	9355440	His delicate frame has grown thinner and his red cheeks are now darkened.
9355440	9358440	His appearance is described in detail.
9358440	9360440	There is no malice or hatred.
9360440	9370440	It's just fanatical sincerity is pride as an educator.
9370440	9376440	And a terrifying smothering love.
9376440	9380440	I don't like where this is going!
9380440	9385440	It continues like that to the very last page.
9385440	9388440	There's no mention of what became of the principal and the boy.
9388440	9394440	Going by the current state of H elementary, I can hazard a guess.
9394440	9398440	You don't look so well, mister.
9398440	9400440	I was in the notebook.
9400440	9402440	The cast up here is up at me.
9402440	9406440	He and the boy in the notebook are about the same age.
9406440	9408440	This is the stuff you share with the kid.
9408440	9413440	I better just sum up the main points for him.
9413440	9415440	That's terrible.
9415440	9418440	Each children are always the victims of eagles of adults.
9418440	9421440	Stupid grown ups are irredeemable!
9421440	9423440	Okay, chill!
9423440	9425440	Chill, kid!
9425440	9432440	Why do you say that makes sense?
9432440	9434440	Yeah, but kid, chill!
9434440	9436440	I know!
9436440	9439440	I know!
9439440	9449440	The revolting evil of adults and the poor boy who became a victim.
9449440	9452440	But is that really the end?
9452440	9455440	If Hanahiko and the boy in the notebook are connected,
9455440	9462440	and the boy turned into a monster, is that even possible?
9462440	9464440	I'm like, yeah, I get it!
9464440	9465440	I get it, kid!
9465440	9474440	I get it, just chill, chill!
9474440	9478440	Untimely deaths produce hatred.
9478440	9481440	Death does not bring it to an end.
9481440	9488440	Such festering sentiments can give birth to the supernatural.
9488440	9494440	Monsters, ghosts, vengeful spirits, they have many names.
9494440	9500440	I believe that you have all heard one or two such stories.
9500440	9503440	And an eagle is similar.
9503440	9506440	Mary's words are hard to swallow.
9506440	9511440	After all those weird events, it only makes sense to accept them.
9511440	9520440	If I turn my back to the truth, all that will await me is death.
9520440	9523440	And who's talking?
9523440	9526440	And Hanahiko is really a monster.
9526440	9530440	Yeah, you must form a plan based off of that hypothesis.
9530440	9534440	Who's talking?
9534440	9536440	Mary is silent a moment.
9536440	9542440	Then her jade glass eyes shift to Mashita.
9542440	9548440	Incidentally, according to Lord Darling's report,
9548440	9553440	there are those amongst you who are considered killing the spirit.
9553440	9559440	Wait, what the fuck is talking?
9559440	9563440	There are those among you who are considering killing the spirit.
9563440	9566440	I shall warn you just in case.
9566440	9570440	That would be very difficult to do.
9570440	9574440	Why is that?
9574440	9580440	I could see Mashita in Nero's eyes, but I made sure to speak up first.
9580440	9584440	They are from the world of the dead.
9584440	9587440	Just as the living cannot become more alive,
9587440	9589440	the dead cannot be killed.
9589440	9595440	The only thing that could possibly destroy is the cursed sentiment.
9595440	9599440	So what does that mean?
9599440	9605440	It's as I told you before, death and life existing together.
9605440	9613440	If that is the origin of the mark, no way to erase it will be there.
9613440	9621440	I swear they need to add name plates to someone because I don't know who's talking sometimes.
9621440	9628440	By driving away the spirit, the curse will also be eliminated.
9628440	9633440	So defeating Hena Hiko is how we'll be able to destroy the mark.
9633440	9639440	Setting aside how he can't be killed, what exactly is the key then?
9639440	9642440	There's nothing more than a concept.
9642440	9647440	I am unsure, but I am certain of one thing.
9647440	9651440	Fate ties the spirit to its place of birth.
9651440	9657440	An object there may be able to fill the role of the key.
9657440	9662440	It's a difficult concept to grasp, but that is just how spirits are.
9662440	9668440	Determining the nature of the key, that would aside your fate.
9668440	9675440	I had a feeling we'll have to keep digging around each elementary.
9675440	9679440	We don't know what cursed sentiments or the key is destroying the grudge.
9679440	9686440	We don't know what the cursed sentiments or the key to destroying the grudges are.
9686440	9691440	Gaining the key and lifting the grudge is the only way to survive.
9691440	9697440	It would be required to be callous to make use of the spirit's fear.
9697440	9701440	The way to repel the spirit lies within its grudge.
9701440	9708440	Remember this, and be careful, and be careful.
9708440	9715440	New info was added to the spirit file, the secret of the underground room.
9715440	9722440	I think Senpai, is this a good place to save?
9722440	9734440	Because I know we didn't get too far in this visual novel, but I'm a little tired.
9734440	9738440	I'm a little tired.
9738440	9744440	It's been a long day, Senpai.
9744440	9749440	Mm-mm.
9752440	9757440	Oops.
9757440	9760440	I don't remember.
9760440	9767440	I can go yet and it's here.
9767440	9771440	Ugh.
9771440	9777440	I'm so sleepy.
9777440	9781440	Yeah, I wanna leave a-
9781440	9789440	I wanna leave the game.
9789440	9795440	Wah!
9795440	9798440	I hope to get the best sleep.
9798440	9800440	Senpai, I will.
9800440	9805440	Also, Senpai was very good and didn't look.
9805440	9815440	You kept yourself pure.
9815440	9823440	I'd like to review next week's...
9823440	9826440	Next week's...
9827440	9834440	So tomorrow, when I said I was slowing down, that was a total lie for this week,
9834440	9841440	so I checked the following week is when I go to three streams.
9841440	9845440	Instead, next week is also five streams.
9845440	9846440	It's five streams.
9846440	9850440	It's not an entire week, so I'm not fully exhausted.
9850440	9854440	But tomorrow, we're back here again.
9854440	9858440	What terrible life advice!
9858440	9862440	Give me your life, give me your questions through morals.
9862440	9864440	Or ask them in chat.
9864440	9870440	Mostly, I would mostly appreciate it if you asked them through morals.
9870440	9874440	By morals, I mean marshmallows.
9874440	9879440	Scroll down.
9879440	9881440	Go down.
9881440	9891440	And ask questions about or send me your questions.
9891440	9896440	And I will give you the answers that you need.
9896440	9899440	Is it going to be good answers?
9899440	9901440	Probably not.
9901440	9903440	Is it answers?
9903440	9906440	Yeah, actually, it's gonna be answers.
9906440	9909440	What do marshmallows do you get a day?
9909440	9918440	It really depends.
9918440	9933440	Sometimes, I have...
9933440	9939440	I get lots of morals, and sometimes, I get not too many morals.
9939440	9946440	And then, some days, I'm like...
9946440	9951440	And then, some days, it's just not very nice morals.
9951440	9956440	And I'm just like, oh, whatever.
9956440	9962440	Between one to a lot, a few?
9962440	9977440	A few, I guess?
9977440	9986440	A few, I guess, so...
9986440	9993440	Right now, I probably have about 200 morals I have to go through.
9993440	9999440	Some of them I don't really answer, because I'm just like taking them to heart, and I'm just like, thank you.
9999440	10007440	Although, I should probably give them hearts, because I haven't been doing that.
10007440	10015440	I have around 200 morals, plus...
10015440	10020440	Yeah, so...
10020440	10025440	Yeah, we've been getting a lot of morals.
10025440	10032440	A lot of them, I feel bad if I repeat them.
10032440	10042440	But I should probably start hearting some morals to let some pies know that I've read them.
10042440	10050440	So I think, yeah, that's pretty, yeah.
10050440	10052440	That's a lot of morals.
10052440	10057440	I don't answer it as much as my senpai, not my senpai story, my genmais.
10057440	10063440	Wow, I'm mixing you up, senpai on the mind, senpai brain rot.
10064440	10067440	That...
10067440	10075440	I'm not as active, because I'm kind of awkward, and I don't know what to reply.
10075440	10084440	And if I feel like I just say, oh, thank you, senpai, or wow, that was really hot senpai, I feel like...
10084440	10087440	I feel like it's not a good enough response.
10087440	10092440	So then I don't answer, and then I feel worse.
10092440	10095440	Don't put your genmates in the basement.
10095440	10099440	I'm a steak.
10099440	10101440	I think they're fine, I can recognize them.
10101440	10106440	I'll be like, I'll lift up, I'll be like, oh, you don't go there.
10106440	10116440	He shone the forehead.
10116440	10119440	Yeah, likewise I never know what to write for similar reasons.
10119440	10123440	I don't know what to say.
10123440	10130440	Otherwise, other than, thank you for supporting me.
10130440	10134440	I'm kind of stupid.
10134440	10140440	But yeah, tomorrow will be terrible life advice plush marshmallow Q&A.
10140440	10145440	I can fully say that I'm not really prepared for it, so I can just...
10145440	10151440	It's probably going to be just saying, saying stuff.
10151440	10157440	And maybe mixed in with the terrible life advice is some actual life advice.
10157440	10159440	Who knows?
10159440	10166440	Going in.
10166440	10169440	And then I get a day off.
10169440	10176440	But luckily on that day off, I think my second audio for Patreon is released.
10176440	10183440	So you can have that in my stead.
10183440	10188440	Then I'm continuing Omari.
10188440	10194440	And then I'm doing Power Wash Simulator, which is my first collab.
10194440	10198440	No wait, technically my second collab with my genmates.
10198440	10200440	And then after that is Zatsu Yapping.
10200440	10202440	So I just yapp about whatever.
10202440	10208440	Probably updates saying...
10208440	10219440	Probably updates about how I'm feeling, what's it like to be in VLR so far, etc.
10219440	10224440	Then after that, Saturday I have a break.
10224440	10232440	Then Sunday I have an unarchived karaoke stream.
10232440	10234440	So it'll be unarchived.
10234440	10237440	I'll be singing, you know, songs.
10237440	10246440	Maybe not well, but I'll be singing.
10246440	10249440	So yeah, I hope some friends can tune into that.
10249440	10253440	Or if you're like, wow, that schedule seems like it sucks.
10253440	10258440	Don't tune in, just kill.
10258440	10263440	And then I'll see you next week, I guess.
10263440	10265440	But yeah, I really want to play Harvester again.
10265440	10269440	So I'm going to play Harvester and Killer 7 again.
10269440	10281440	So I'd really love to see that.
10281440	10283440	Anyway, you sing is the correct way.
10283440	10285440	We are a captive audience.
10285440	10288440	Mercy singing us to us is always welcome.
10288440	10290440	Don't get the holes.
10290440	10293440	Be nice to me, senpai.
10293440	10297440	It's going to be my first time singing in front of my senpai.
10297440	10307440	So I think I'll be a little bit more nervous than usual.
10307440	10313440	I'll probably be singing songs I'm familiar with and some new songs that I'm just like, yeah.
10313440	10320440	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
10320440	10322440	So, yeah.
10322440	10324440	That's it for today.
10324440	10326440	Let me check.
10326440	10328440	What's going on?
10328440	10333440	Oh my gosh, Azura is still live?
10333440	10335440	Give me a second, senpai.
10335440	10347440	I forget how to do this, but I'm going to figure out how to raid.
10347440	10350440	I forgot how to do it.
10350440	10359440	It's always because my gen mates raid into me.
10359440	10362440	Raid into me and I'm not really the one.
10362440	10363440	Okay, hold on.
10363440	10364440	I think I found it.
10364440	10366440	I think I found it.
10366440	10367440	Please wait for me.
10367440	10370440	Okay, senpai.
10370440	10376440	What is this?
10376440	10379440	This?
10379440	10381440	I found it.
10381440	10387440	I found a senpai.
10387440	10403440	She's live.
10403440	10404440	I can redirect.
10404440	10407440	I can do it.
10407440	10409440	Okay, senpai.
10409440	10413440	It should redirect now and if it doesn't, just go over there, okay?
10413440	10415440	I love you, senpai.
10415440	10417440	See you again tomorrow.
10417440	10420440	And I'm going to rest up now.
10420440	10421440	Thank you.
10421440	10424440	I'm so sorry that I was so very tired and messing and stumbling on my words.
10424440	10425440	I was just...
10425440	10429440	I was not there.
10429440	10431440	Thank you, senpai.
10431440	10435440	And I'll see you again next time.
10435440	10437440	Scream for Mercy!
10437440	10439440	Bye-bye!
10439440	10441440	Mwah!
