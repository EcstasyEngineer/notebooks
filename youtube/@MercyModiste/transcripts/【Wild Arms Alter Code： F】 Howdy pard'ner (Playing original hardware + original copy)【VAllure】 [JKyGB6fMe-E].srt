00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,360

23
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,000
happens don't trust me with anything you asked me to take care of people I'm

24
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:40,720
gonna not do a good job at least to the eye of a rather normal person

25
00:13:40,720 --> 00:14:03,320
oh we can we actually have donations oh my gosh we can actually donate hey you in

26
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,000
the mini skirt have we met before I feel like I know you leave this fate I'll

27
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:19,080
survive this long to meet you that's the queen sass that's the queen sass I was

28
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,240
I didn't think they were actually serious about the 600k

29
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,440
I didn't think they were actually serious but I guess they are it's I wish I had

30
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,600
that kind of money

31
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,520
I remember them saying it was like past the mountains or something

32
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,960
it might be weeks it might be this way

33
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:36,400
never eat shredded wheat that's how I remember it

34
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:45,000
that's how I remember my direction sort of

35
00:15:45,000 --> 00:16:04,360
I can't remember what I was supposed to press oh yeah this thing this is so dumb

36
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:17,160
and here in the middle of me doing my radar thing should I move over some pie

37
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:25,320
so that you can actually see the mini map there we go over here

38
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,200
that's the volume by the way I'm not sure if the volume is good for my some

39
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:48,840
pies I am good okay I can make a big map too okay I can't remember how to do

40
00:16:48,840 --> 00:17:10,280
that I think we're very close I see something here oh are you this the

41
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,760
mountain path I think this is correct

42
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,920
let me look at the sign watch out for trolls when you're attacked do not

43
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:35,200
engage in battle let them pass focus on protecting yourself for a while wait we

44
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,040
had a book I think trolls don't like the light

45
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,880
I think that's what they said

46
00:17:47,880 --> 00:18:04,320
bomb bombs away that's a nice ow ow you're a hole

47
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:28,040
a troll

48
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,160
huh that's that's that's a troll

49
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:57,200
they said focus on protecting ourselves so maybe we guard and then I can do what

50
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:08,480
was this one again what zero

51
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:32,760
okay can we one

52
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:49,080
Um, no.

53
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,680
I'm prepared to die.

54
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Jesus!

55
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Jesus!

56
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
We are going...

57
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Back!

58
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Hold on.

59
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
We're doing this again.

60
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
I'm going to go read about trolls again.

61
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Thank you.

62
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
You

63
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
You

64
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
You

65
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
You

66
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
I can't catch up with that.

67
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,680
I can't catch up with it.

68
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
With it.

69
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Did I practice it? I only practiced a little bit.

70
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
I only practiced a little bit.

71
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,680
I did. I did. This part was the little bit part.

72
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
I only practiced a little bit.

73
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
It wasn't part.

74
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
That was the part I practiced!

75
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
I found the notepad mistake!

76
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:53,620
And I found the notes by mistake.

77
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,620
I think that's where I was supposed to go, maybe?

78
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,580
I don't remember.

79
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:05,340
I'm actually serious about going like, oh, where the fuck am I supposed to go?

80
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,980
Is there anything mercy can't do?

81
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,980
I can't whistle.

82
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:24,300
I can't whistle.

83
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,180
OK, hold on.

84
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,780
I just need someone to tell me where the fuck I'm going.

85
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,280
Pretty sure I was right.

86
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,780
Oh, fuck.

87
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,780
Down to hide, hope for the concerns, blah, blah, of the citizens, blah, blah, blah, blah,

88
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,880
blah, doob.

89
00:24:49,880 --> 00:25:00,080
Everyone's gone.

90
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,880
Maybe it is the mountain pass.

91
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,780
Oh, let me go back to the night saw.

92
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,480
The night's thingy and then reread that book.

93
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,380
I'm pretty sure we're supposed to just guard and just cry.

94
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:36,780
That's a huge possibility.

95
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,680
Hi.

96
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:44,080
By the time being, we are using the guardhouse as emergency lodging for all travelers.

97
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,780
Please understand, we do have the charity for lodging here.

98
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,080
Wow.

99
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,180
Thanks.

100
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,680
Anatomy of a demon, that's not right.

101
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,680
It should be over here.

102
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,380
Troll control.

103
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,280
OK, massive physical strength, great survival skills, faced with a troll.

104
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,780
If you're skilled, feel free to fight.

105
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,980
It's because fear is light.

106
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,380
One flash may lead to victory.

107
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,180
Troll is cautious and careful.

108
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,780
Leave troll alone.

109
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,380
Got it.

110
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:32,180
Defend the fuck.

111
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,880
OK, we just defend light magic.

112
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,580
Did you see what happened when I did light magic?

113
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:47,580
Shit awe.

114
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,280
Beagle zero in red too.

115
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,180
It was big red.

116
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,080
I felt insulted.

117
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:07,080
It was like looking at a test again, a test mark that I got back in like grade school.

118
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,280
I was like, oh cool, I have light magic.

119
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,980
Let's use that.

120
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,880
Yeah, I have light magic.

121
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,680
OK, it's time to face.

122
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,780
As if you ever got a single zero on a test ever.

123
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,480
Um, I sure did.

124
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:46,780
It's because I think the flashing ones.

125
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,380
Yeah, you did.

126
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:57,080
Yeah, I've gotten to zero before.

127
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:14,680
I may be somewhat academically skilled, but I have been granted zeroes before because

128
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,280
they just didn't like me.

129
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,880
For what subject?

130
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,480
Um, I got a zero in art.

131
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:43,880
It's kind of subjective, it's kind of a subjective, subjective thing in art is kind of a subjective

132
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:54,780
thing, which I thought was kind of dumb.

133
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,180
Which, did you just not turn the incitement in?

134
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,380
No, they just didn't like what I did.

135
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:14,780
It's got a zero because I didn't like what I did.

136
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,880
Oh, sorry, I need Rudy here.

137
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,480
Give me your stuff.

138
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,980
Hopefully, this hits.

139
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:31,780
No, OK, we guard until it runs away, right?

140
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
That's not a troll.

141
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,880
That's a lizard man.

142
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,780
That's a different guy.

143
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Shoot.

144
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:54,580
The fire beats most people, right?

145
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,580
Yeah, we can take these guys.

146
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,380
Shoot.

147
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,580
Gun strong.

148
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,680
Gun.

149
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:10,180
Me like gun.

150
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:28,380
I knew it.

151
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:46,980
That means I just have to go here.

152
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
Shoot.

153
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,780
Kill.

154
00:30:49,780 --> 00:31:13,180
Set on fire.

155
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,080
It's always Jack who's getting destroyed.

156
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,480
OK, he deserves it.

157
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:32,180
Yeah.

158
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,980
Give me my level ups.

159
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,680
I want my bomb to reach.

160
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,280
Hold on.

161
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,880
OK, hold on.

162
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,380
Ow.

163
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,980
Fuck.

164
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,880
I get up up there.

165
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,080
I get up there.

166
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm out.

167
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:03,680
I jump.

168
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,780
OK, that's the troll.

169
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,680
Guard.

170
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,580
Guard.

171
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,280
Guard.

172
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:28,980
Do not shoot guard.

173
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,080
Guard.

174
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,380
Guard, guard, guard, guard, guard.

175
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,180
Please leave me alone, you scary.

176
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,780
Guard, guard, guard.

177
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:53,780
Thank you for leaving.

178
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,780
Kind of scary, not going to lie.

179
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:11,380
I can't reach, but you know, maybe, maybe I do have to change it to Cecilia and be like,

180
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:39,480

Yeah, that's good enough right oh

224
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:03,240
It's so hard to see sometimes I think the 3d makes some things pretty good and some things just really awful

225
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Yeah, fuck it up

00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,360
Nectar her nectar

237
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,240
I have to go around again, I think

238
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
Got ambushed

239
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,960

Please heal yourself

245
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,160
Never mind

246
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
Goodbye my vitality

247
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,240
All

248
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,200
My vitality is gone

249
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,040
We guard

250
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,200
The troll is scary the troll is scary

251
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,920
There's only one change that they made to this version that I hate they took away a character's unique music theme

252
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
That's always a shame

253
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
I

254
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,120
Never played the first one so this is a version so I

255
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,720
Never

256
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
Never played that version before you know

257
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,520
Okay, hold on I gotta take off my glasses

258
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:24,480
I think I need to ask the optometrist to loosen these glasses because they pinched the side of my head really tightly

259
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
I

260
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
They're very uncomfortable

261
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,520
Ow

262
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,440
Are they plastic or metal glasses metal

263
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
Luckily I get like a free

264
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:03,440
Rechain changes I need a girl to heal up

265
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:34,160
Wait, did she she just like hit them?

266
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,400
Yeah, let's have a heal berry for you, babe. I

267
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,400
Was surprised she like she just like hit them

268
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:02,280
Metal you can adjust for yourself. You don't if you don't trust yourself not to break them. Just spending gently I

269
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,040
Sell them for a living. Oh, we got an optometrist in the house

270
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,240
Can you see this far away? Can you read what's on the screen?

271
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,240
I

272
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,360
Kind of cool just to hear about wait

273
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,080

00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,600
Was a shitty ladder

277
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,160
Who built that it doesn't even work

278
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,240
I

279
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,200
I

280
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,760
I

281
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,960
Maybe I need to activate something first like your heart

282
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,200
I

283
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,440
Looks like there's a thing in any oh do I have to leave then

284
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160

00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,520
Oh

00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,440
Those four corners look weak like the foundation of mine

287
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Oh

288
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,320

Maybe gonna do a line of bombs, okay

316
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,200

318
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:44,200

01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,320
Is there another path I think that might be the only path senpai

361
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:11,880
Is that for the one up there and I don't know how to get up there

362
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,680
There's a path up there

363
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:33,240
This this way I just not see the path am I blind oh yeah, I'm just blind

364

365
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,360

We're just leveling up. Yeah

368
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:32,600
My first instinct is to throw

369
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,480
Wait, maybe that area I could actually have bombed

370
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,120
SOS FF

371
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,840
Skills are special abilities that can be added to each character skill must be equipped to work

372
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
They don't work by carrying them

373
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:00,120
After selecting skill in the main menu select the character

374
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,840
want to equip then

375
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,520
The skill menu will open each character has ps points

376
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:13,000
Skills can be equipped if the character's ps points meets the requirement for the skill

377
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,760
Also, when a skill is unequipped your ps points will be lost

378
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,480
Different skills to a character depending on the situation. Okie-dokie. Let's go

379

534
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:36,040
You cannot proceed any further because of the water dog. Let me talk to the dog

535
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,520
Did it bark oh it barks it barks

536
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,800
Welcome I specialize in water fire and water magic

537
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:03,560
What kind of magic do you prefer pack or support? I don't think I have any more crests, but if I do I would grab everything

538
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:17,880
Can I steal this boat? I want to steal this nice boat for my own

539
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,240
So

540
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,360
Looking in

541
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,280
Maybe going to rest up

542
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:50,280
One of the crest sorcerer spells is called quick and it increases the reaction time of everyone in your group

543
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,160
It's quite effective if used with members who have fast draw technique

544
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,800
I'm giving in a shot

545
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,080
If I had any crests I would but I don't

546
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:11,320
One thing after another I'm busy day. Well, hello, can I help you? Okay, launching just one. Okay

547
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,480
I

548
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,960
Need I need

549
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,840
I need lodgings. I know it's expensive

550
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,400
But I needed it

551
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,920
I don't all in faith in nature. Would you like to read it? Yes

552
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:42,040
Each guardian is lord of an elemental power that is capable of manipulating

553
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,360
They create sweeping torrents earthquakes, even tornadoes

554
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:52,520
The people of Fugaya have learned to live with these powerful energies as they are a necessary

555
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,400
Sahari part of nature

556
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:04,600
People learned to fear and respect the awesome powers of the guardians. However, respect and fear eventually becomes worship

557
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:10,520
This faith is found all over Fugaya in temples built for guardians

558
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,480
Nice I stole their stuff

559
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
I stole their stuff

560
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,720
Okay

561
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,800
What if I talk to this guy and be like, hey, help me drain the water

562
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,680
I feel like it's over there. How do I do it?

563
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,800
Can I go in here?

564
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:10,840
Dog no, that's a cat never mind. I'm I'm I'm so stupid

565
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,320
The book is titled skill lessons. Would you like to read it?

566
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:25,000
PS points are rewarded as your level increases and with these you can equip a variety of personal skills

567
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,840
These are two important points to remember

568
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:34,520
First you will need a specific amount of PS points in order to equip a personal skill

569
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:40,440
Second, even though even with enough points, you cannot equip duplicates of the same skill

570
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:47,160
For example, if you qualify for multiple xx resistance and have enough points, you are still only allowed to equip one

571
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:54,920
But if the same skill type have different names i.e. xx resistant one and xx resistance two you can equip both

572
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:02,200
In this case xx resistance one and xx resistance two combined to make xx resistance three

573
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:06,760
The efficiency of editing skills is up to each player

574
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,360
Thanks

575
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,400
Hi

576
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:21,080
I hope the rumors about out of hide being attacked by demons is not true

577
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,280
But we all know the saying where there's smoke, there's fire. I hope it's not true

578
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:33,640
Our late priestess put a lot of effort into spreading and cultivating this town's belief in the guardians

579
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:39,480
Look at his son though. He has no intentions of following his father's wisdom. Such a shame

580
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:46,600
Abundance of water includes the town is full of happy people. I feel fortunate to be living in this town

581
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,160
I'm about xx resistance. Nobody is resistant to xxx

582
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,400
Nobody is resistant to that not even you

583
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,140
I see it it's right there

584
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:16,140
I

585
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:27,020
Oops

586
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:47,020
You may can turn this little wheel no

587
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:03,020
They must have sound hella hella guidebooks

588
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,140
I

589
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,500
Did I miss a building? Yeah, that's my question too. Did I miss a building?

590
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,940
This is awfully small, isn't it?

591
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,940
Oh

592
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:46,940
The one with the crest shop can I enter that one? Oh, yeah, there's a door at the side. Thank you

593
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:57,420
I'm an armsmeister extraordinaire, but don't ask me about anything else

594
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:03,660
Ha oh, yeah bullets easiness critical

595
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,820
Uh critical

596
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,860
Our bullets

597
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,580
Hit our bullets

598
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,540
Bullets

599
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,020
Bullets

600
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:35,900
I I only hopped bullets

601
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,460
Goodbye my money

602
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,100
This is my

603
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,420
Ah

604
01:34:53,660 --> 01:35:00,700
Since my wife left me I found out that it is much tougher to take care of kids than it is to take care of arms

605
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:07,100
My daughter does not understand any of my logic, but just cries over trivial matters

606
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:12,780
God my wife why couldn't she have taken our daughter with her? What a guy?

607
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:16,540
I shouldn't have bought from you you piece of shit

608
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:21,020
I shouldn't have bought this from you. I could have gone back to town

609
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:27,420
Besides the glass case is a highly polished medium-sized arm

610
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:35,660
Do not say base. I will ban you or hit at least hit you very very hard

611
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,860
You

612
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:00,380
Mods

613
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,140
You know what to do

614
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:18,780
Gosh cat

615
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,900
But there's another one over there what the hell there's so many

616
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:32,700
Drum is filled with water seems like a lot even for this town

617
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:37,020
There's another one there

618
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:50,860
He's a shitty dad why didn't the mom take the kid with her they're both shitty parents

619
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,100
No, can I not send

620
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,060
I

621
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:19,180
Please let me in

622
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:25,180
I want to go around

623
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:29,100
So we'll lend me a boat

624
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:35,100
So

625
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:55,820
Please give me your boat. I want it

626
01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:05,980
Did you have anything else in here books I can read things I can steal

627
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:17,020
The llama

628
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:23,840
But I want to get the little girl stuff

629
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:28,620
I want to get her turtle

630
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:48,620
Am I seriously not allowed to get her turtle my bard from having that happen

631
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:58,060
You

632
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:14,620
Turtles in the canal maybe all we need to stop by you mean the map that's not the map

633
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:22,560
They said northwest

634
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:28,540
Not this

635
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:34,700
I was out of town. Oh was it?

636
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:47,020
Why that's self I don't know directions, okay

637
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:52,700
It's very difficult

638
01:39:55,900 --> 01:40:01,500
Although I am technically directionally challenged. I remember when I lived in Japan

639
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:08,060
I would always cry I would always cry a lot because I always get lost on the on the trains

640
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:21,340
I got really lost in a train station before

641
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:26,540
Because the train station was like a mall and I couldn't find the other side

642
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:40,620
What the fuck are those

643
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,580
I

644
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:49,980
Need an aoe

645
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,300
They call it an aoe where you hit everything

646
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:02,140
Thank you for the 420 tip anima

647
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:08,940
Junkie one two three. It's nice to watch a streamer live. Do you not often get to watch streamers live?

648
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:12,300
There's always the vods, but people are like

649
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:14,940
um

650
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:18,540
There is a little bit of something special to see something live

651
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,380
Can I come live

652
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:36,940
No work makes it hard to watch. I'm glad you could drop by then. Thank you

653
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:40,940
You

654
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:58,940
In our I came from the cave

655
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:01,660
I

656
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,820
Did I come from somewhere else?

657
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:15,420
This the cave that I was before no the cave was further than our

658
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:25,340
I was probably new then go in sand river

659
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:31,340
You

660
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:47,660
This where I'm gonna find the dang turtle is that a fucking monkey

661
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:54,700
Oh, that's a big guy. I hope it dies quickly

662
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
Oh

663
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,500
That's that's a lot. What the fuck

664
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh that hurts

665
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:24,940
Oh, oh, oh that really hurt. Oh what the fuck

666
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:30,940
Yeah

667
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:40,140
Anyways, that's a monkey

668
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:49,340
Wait, there's just a monkey here doesn't do anything

669
01:43:49,340 --> 01:44:01,100
Is it do anything monkeys are cute

670
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:12,620
I feel sad because I cannot talk to monkey and I really want to

671
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,780
This is treasure box solidly locked. Of course it's using my break

672
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:20,780
Bombs away

673
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,580
Used radar

674
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:31,100
Radar is a machine that detects hidden passages or devices

675
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:38,860
By pressing square button you need to find something you are using to utilize it. Thank you for

676
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:44,460
So how do I use it? Do I have to equip it?

677
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:46,460
So

678
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:10,380
That's the button to change characters the left trigger

679
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,460
So

680
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,580
There's how do I use this tool?

681
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:56,780
There's another button to switch my stuff this is the run

682
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:05,100
Well, Rudy's luck is bad

683
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:17,180
This

684
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,500
Thank you

685
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:46,460
Oh

686
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:06,380
Me lightning will work

687
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:16,940
Yes, goodness

688
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:20,540
Yes, good good

689
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:32,460
Thank you though, thank you

690
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:36,220
Oops

691
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:41,180
Okay, I see them but how do I like

692
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:43,900
Get to there

693
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,900
I

694
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:29,500
Like it shows us like the hidden items but not but not um

695
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:35,020
Not like a cool path, you know

696
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:39,580
I fall I did fall

697
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:48,940
Monkey, do you know anything do you know anything about this monkey?

698
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:53,740
Should I go back to town is that what it's hitting to me?

699
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:03,260
Like the scan move show I hit it in path

700
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:11,340
But all I see is the items and not a hidden path

701
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:30,620
Maybe I'll go back to town I'll go back to town

702
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,500
Oh

703
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:54,780
Can half-time cross it that's true

704
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:10,300
I forgot about handpan

705
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:20,060
I forgot about handpan, how can I forget about our handsome pants pants?

706
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,980
Now I don't think it's working

707
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:45,980
If I stand on the edge here, no

708
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:53,420
No, I don't think so. I'm just gonna go into town

709
01:50:55,180 --> 01:51:01,020
Back into town again and see if there's like hidden paths in the town

710
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:07,020
So

711
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:20,540
Surprise we're here to kill you

712
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:42,540
Like I'm a hundred percent sure the scan tutorial showed us things back in town, so we should go back to town

713
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:08,860
I don't know if you can hear it, but the ps4 is so loud

714
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:26,300
We will return for the turtle or maybe the turtles already there do not do not only hit

715
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:37,020
Do

716
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:51,740
What do you mean ps2 shit, what did I say?

717
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:58,620
Did I say p nice a psn or something yes for shit

718
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,940
Oh

719
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:11,420
Oopsies, oopsies even numbers get mixed up. Whoopsies

720
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:25,820
I honestly actually it was the other day thank you some pies by the way for the some pies that

721
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:30,620
I

722
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:40,620
There's something there

723
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,500
In path

724
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:49,820
So

725
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:57,900
I just see a treasure, but is there tells you the hidden paths, right?

726
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,700
I don't see any paths

727
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:20,060
The heck

728
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,700
Past the ladder I I know this ladder

729
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:42,780
But I'm trying to find like they're hidden mechanics

730
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:47,980
Where's the hidden path stuff I see the treasure but not the path

731
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:09,180
Maybe it has to be used in a building yeah, I'm gonna use it on this one

732
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,780
Okay

733
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:25,580
Oh as I was saying I was buying some games for the ps4, uh

734
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:34,780
I bought uh, what was it called? I think it's called

735
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,580
anonymous cold

736
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,580
for the ps4 thanks to the

737
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:44,060
The game fund that some pies

738
01:55:53,500 --> 01:56:02,220
Oh we found it turtle here you go you go kid turtle isn't a real turtle

739
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:12,220
I

740
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:15,740
Hold on I got this

741
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:24,220
Oh, hey, that's my turn I can't believe it was it was there it was under her bed

742
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:30,300
You found it. Thank you the bar owner's father who used to be the priest

743
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:37,740
Of the guardians temple made this for me. This turtle is filled with the power of water guardian. It's my treasure

744
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:43,500
I'm so happy. I'm never alone as long as I have this evening when my father is away

745
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:56,140
Great. Oh, what was I saying? I was gonna bring my ps4 down. I

746
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,940
Did you know there's a lot of games?

747
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:02,220
um for sale on the ps5, but the

748
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:05,020
PS5 is kind of expensive

749
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:12,060
Uh, so thanks to the funds that some pies have given me. I have spent some money on some games

750
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:18,860
I'm hopefully after you finish these games that hope that will hopefully, uh, pick up and maybe finish together

751
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:25,820
So I picked up anonymous cold and I picked up, um

752
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:30,940
They picked up, uh

753
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:34,700
a bunch of a bunch of it okay

754
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:38,620
a bunch of air

755
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:40,700
and

756
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,940
I picked up, um

757
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:50,380
Some pointing clicks as well

758
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:57,020
It's great to see Sadie's got her doll back

759
01:57:57,180 --> 01:58:01,260
I remembered what the bar's owner father the priest at the guardian temple used to tell me

760
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:04,860
Told me to hang a pair of scissors upside down when items were lost

761
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:08,700
Scissors, huh?

762
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:15,660
Well, kind um may have some uh days

763
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:24,620
Scissors also scissors mentioned whoo hang a pair of scissors upside down

764
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:33,260
The start is not for a random swinging, but it should

765
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:37,980
Penetrate the vital spot of your opponent with one swift accurate swing

766
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:42,700
You increase your reaction your fast draw will become much more powerful

767
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:49,980
Oh, I can just talk to him

768
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,220
I

769
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:58,620
The guardian's temple I haven't heard that name in a while. Well, I can tell you everything I do know

770
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:04,060
A long time ago. My father was the priest at in that temple. He used to tell me all kinds of strange stories

771
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:07,100
This is odd since I ended up a bar owner

772
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:11,740
Have to take care of some something would you mind waiting a little bit?

773
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:16,220
Not at all. Oh just order something for while we wait

774
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:22,540
Good idea. Tell you what this meal is on the house. It's been a while since I've talked about my father or the temple

775
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:28,860
All right. All right. What's the most expensive dish on the menu? Is it kidding?

776
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:32,140
And knows what's up

777
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:45,100
Anyways as for days, maybe it starts with uh, you know, maybe maybe it's about learning at a school

778
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:48,060
At some days

779
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:52,620
Well, now take a look at the list

780
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:17,100
Oh

781
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:26,940
Oh

782
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:30,060
There's my

783
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:32,060
Oh

784
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:48,140
Right, it doesn't show me what I ordered because it's like sensitive stuff and I have to log into my account

785
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:49,820
Okay, I can't do that

786
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:51,820
But I did remember ordering

787
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:56,060
Days I did remember ordering. Um

788
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:02,460
I

789
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:06,860
Love love love love series

790
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,660
and

791
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:11,340
I remember

792
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:13,820
Getting a couple other stuff, but yeah

793
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:18,940
I can't remember all of them. I got them all on. Oh, I also got uh

794
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:24,140
Because a long time ago I played a really bad like

795
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:27,420
Pan translation of

796
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:29,340
Totono

797
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,340
You guys know Totono

798
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:35,900
I think that's a JP name

799
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:43,100
So, yeah, uh, I have Totono now

800
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:46,460
So Totono is

801
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:49,820
Kanajo and Kanajo no

802
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:53,100
What

803
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:57,420
What was the last word again

804
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:59,660
Hold on also known as

805
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:10,220
What's the English name you and me and her yeah

806
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:19,660
Kimi Kimi to Kanajo

807
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:21,660
Oh

808
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:27,820
So Kanajo no Koi Koi Koi. Yeah that one

809
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:37,980
Yeah, that one so Totono for short because it's a pretty long title, right? So they just use the like

810
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:42,220
Words in between Kimi Kanajo

811
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:45,980
Koi Koi Koli Koli

812
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:51,100
Yeah, that one I played that one

813
02:02:53,660 --> 02:03:03,260
Ages ago when it was not a very good translation, I think it was like really shitty machine translation

814
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:25,420
Was it bad funny or just bad the machine translation was just kind of bad

815
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:32,620
But kind of I mean a lot bad and then it was really funky as well because it wasn't really a

816
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:41,020
Genuine rip because when the original game came out it was a game that came on a usb, okay

817
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:45,900
It came for it on a usb to kind of stop um

818
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:52,460
Uh like pirating and stuff

819
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:05,660
So it was extremely hard to uh

820
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:14,780
It was extremely hard to um

821
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:21,100
To pirate I think it was the first I remember back in the day

822
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:26,140
It was the first game just re-abuted on a usb

823
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:38,540
It was distributed on a usb because it had some kind of encoding on it

824
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:43,020
So

825
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,020
That it's like old school

826
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:59,020
so when it first came out it was on a usb and uh people had trouble obviously because of the pirating thing

827
02:04:59,980 --> 02:05:01,580
people had

828
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:03,100
trouble ripping it

829
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:05,100
from the

830
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:08,060
From the usb

831
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:11,740
So it would it was like kind of lost and in different

832
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:18,540
It was in like it was like a patchwork to to put it together and it was like really shitty

833
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:26,780
It was really shitty

834
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:31,340
So yeah

835
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:34,140
I

836
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:39,180
I'm surprised

837
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:43,420
That uh and the reason why and because it was on like a usb

838
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:46,620
it was

839
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:50,860
It was how they managed to do

840
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:53,180
likes

841
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:55,180
uh certain things

842
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:57,180
certain coding things that

843
02:05:57,980 --> 02:06:04,540
Would uh for example you would talk to what's her face you would return if they had a coding in the game

844
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:07,180
uh in the usb that said

845
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:11,740
Uh after 10 years 15 years 20 years

846
02:06:12,620 --> 02:06:14,620
Anywhere past 10 years

847
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:18,620
If you go back to the game the character would address you

848
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:20,700
Uh

849
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:23,660
And be like it's been x amount of years, huh?

850
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:28,220
That kind of thing and kind of like broke the fourth wall, right?

851
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:44,380
So yeah, uh, I remember when

852
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:52,060
So ddlc before ddlc I when I saw

853
02:06:53,020 --> 02:07:00,780
Uh ddlc I immediately thought of totono and I was like I think this was inspired by totono

854
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:04,300
and then totono, uh, obviously got distributed

855
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,460
Uh

856
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:08,780
More now so totono is super well known

857
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:12,940
Super well now. I'm pretty sure there are more people

858
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:15,820
um

859
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:18,780
More people who know about

860
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:23,900
Like what happens in totono than I do

861
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:29,500
Then I do because I remember I was such a big deal

862
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:32,300
big deal when it came out because uh

863
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:35,260
nitro plus

864
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:37,340
didn't

865
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:39,340
Release a lot of games

866
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:40,460
right

867
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:45,900
And so when they revealed this new game it was like people were going insane

868
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:53,180
People were going insane because they were like oh my gosh a new game and they like

869
02:07:54,140 --> 02:07:55,660
And then

870
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:59,260
You know, there was the twist in the story. I know about the twit

871
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:04,940
So people just like bought it right people bought it. So a lot of people

872
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:13,100
Uh, I don't know if there's like a usb of totono still out there, but uh, they advertised it on like

873
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:16,060
On like the first time it's like here's a usb

874
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:23,580
Here's a usb that you use. We don't use uh CDs anymore. We use usb now and it'll be so cool

875
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:30,460
Of course, it was only in japan. So, uh, I don't really know how the usb worked

876
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:33,740
But all I know was that it was released on a usb

877
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:45,340
So I'll be probably my first time actually playing it playing it

878
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:48,940
And not like some really

879
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:53,660
Bad version of it and some and sometimes a bad version of it would just be like

880
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:59,340
Not even gameplay. It would just be like screenshots of the game and then the translated text on the game

881
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:06,540
So

882
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:17,660
That's how that's how it was played

883
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:23,020
That's how dang and rompa used to be fans

884
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:29,100
Translated to fan the fans translation of dang and rompa was a bunch of fucking screenshots

885
02:09:29,900 --> 02:09:31,900
Yes

886
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:36,220
And you would play it through the website

887
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:55,500
How would you do it it was it was like, you know, one of those kind of like pointing like they would have the hyperlinks

888
02:09:56,700 --> 02:09:58,460
you know like

889
02:09:58,460 --> 02:10:03,020
Choices and then you would click this the the hyperlink choice

890
02:10:08,060 --> 02:10:11,260
You would pick the hyperlink choices, but it was just like pictures

891
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:24,080
Anyways, that's how it used to be played

892
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:26,080
And

893
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:31,920
It was uh dang and rompa was considered pretty hard

894
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:34,240
uh

895
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:36,240
To to translate

896
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:41,440
Uh, but I'm pretty sure that fan that fan translation they had

897
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:47,620
Was a pretty big catalyst of why they wanted it to bring bring it over to a western market

898
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:56,720
Uh

899
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:00,720
Those were dark days and they were great in their own ways

900
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:10,560
Oh, yeah, and sometimes sometimes the websites would have a little uh quick time player and you would click it to hear the bg

901
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:16,880
And you would pretend like you were playing the games with the music playing in the background

902
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,920
Those are dark days

903
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:35,440
Sometimes um, you know, you there would be a little play button beside the dialogue and you could hear the dialogue as well

904
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:44,240
The things we had to do to play the japanese games

905
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:51,520
I was there do not talk to me about the dark days. I was there

906
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:56,240
I also did this uh

907
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:59,600
With uh

908
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
A bunch of yallie

909
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,560
A bunch of bl as well

910
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:07,680
I did this with

911
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
um

912
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,280
I did this with dramatically murder togenu no chi

913
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:24,000
Uh, what else did I fucking do it with?

914
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I

915
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:34,160
Enzai I think it was uh, it was called enzai

916
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:45,360
So I would consider those played but like never actually played you get what I mean senpai like you would play it

917
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:50,400
Because the website was so interactable. It was like playing the game, but you didn't really

918
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:54,800
Lay it because it wasn't you know, it didn't have the ui

919
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:08,400
Wait, am I old?

920
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,920
Enzai actually has a picture translation

921
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:18,720
I saw I didn't buy it though because I was like, I don't know if my audience would like that

922
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,720
Like is it just a me thing?

923
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:25,600
Ah is whatever

924
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:44,080
Hey, I'm just like way did no one else experience this I only saw a few senpais in chat talk about how they experienced this

925
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:51,120
What should we get?

926
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:54,720
Oh, we will have six orders of a large chow mein

927
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,680
We will have six orders of large chow mein with extra vegetables. Is that okay?

928
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:12,000
Reminds me of the

929
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:18,560
Amount of work I had to play suki heimei in fate stay night vn only for to come out years later in the osu

930
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:21,040
I did that with fate stay night as well

931
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:27,200
And suki and suki heimei actually I did the same thing

932
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:32,720
And that's where I learned how much I hate emi and shiki

933
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,360
I

934
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:43,840
Was like wow I hate these guys so damn fucking much

935
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:50,640
I did that for fate actually now that I think about

936
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:57,520
Really see it's not all loss. It's just a memory that needs to be uh slowly

937
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:02,480
Unlocked for you to be like here's the screen translations

938
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:04,720
I

939
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:20,720
Something we want to forget mercy. Is it the same thing as watching?

940
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,200
um anime

941
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:29,760
And like parts you get the hd version if it was in 32 parts and the really shitty version if it was only in three parts

942
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:35,280
So

943
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:41,200
And then sometimes some of the parts would be missing so you're like great. I can't find that part

944
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:44,160
I

945
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,800
That's how it used to be

946
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:03,040
but now I'm glad that

947
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,040
We're not we're no longer. Um, what's the word?

948
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,160
A lot of things being translated

949
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:18,320
We don't really have to find because it will be eventually translated here or or it has a simultaneous release

950
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:26,080
Where the game will be simultaneously released both the japanese version and the english version at once

951
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:31,760
That was now we live in a pretty good time now

952
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:33,920
Ah

953
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:41,280
Like for example, um, I think dungeon meshi had the translation

954
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:49,520
Uh and their release on on netflix on netflix at the same time. So it's doing a simultaneous release all over the world

955
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Yeah

956
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:56,480
Oh

957
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Although I wish I want

958
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:04,880
It's so I just watch anime on free sites. They're more reliable. I'm not gonna lie to you

959
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,280
I

960
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:09,280
have

961
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:13,920
I have um

962
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:21,840
I want to enjoy crunchy roll and all the sites but crunchy rolls service sucks

963
02:17:22,640 --> 02:17:29,840
It sucks. So it's the funny thing is I do try my best to like watch things on like official, um

964
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:36,640
On unofficial platforms, but sometimes it's just so bad

965
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:42,160
It's so bad that I have to ask my friend steve

966
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:46,560
To sail the seeds for it

967
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:51,440
My cool friend steve

968
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:53,600
I

969
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:17,680
I

970
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:21,280
I do really try I really try

971
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,680
till um

972
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:28,320
To to to watch things legally and get things legally, uh bill

973
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:35,520
Uh, so like for example, like some of my favorite animes. I have the blu ray version of it or the dvd version of it

974
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:42,100
Love that one cool friend who somehow has everything. Yeah, that's steve steve has everything

975
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:57,200
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry. I I'm just like rambling about like the dark old days the dark early days of the early days of the internet

976
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:07,760
Is this with that because it early oh well, it's early enough

977
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,840
I

978
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:21,680
Early days of being an anime fan. I was bullied for those days and I worked hard for those days

979
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,520
You know what's actually a pretty good decent site to watch like anime for free on

980
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:42,240
Uh would be like through legal means of course, uh, I was watching um retro crush

981
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:45,440
I'm not sure if it's free anymore

982
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:49,920
Ishoki kuai we love you rambles d

983
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,760
Oh my gosh, the texas feed works

984
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:56,560
Thank you. He sat to a daijou for the ten dollar staff

985
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:59,760
Tiff I didn't even have to read that out loud

986
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:02,560
Ha

987
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,880
It was like colon D

988
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:15,840
It's supposed to be colon D. It's back. It finally didn't break again. Oh gosh. Hold on. I have some screaming here

989
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:26,560
Okay, uh, I have

990
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:30,560
Retro crush and there was another app that I was using

991
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:33,440
That allowed you to watch uh

992
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:38,080
Watch anime for free and had like sailor moon on it

993
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:43,280
I forgot what it was called, but it was free. It was free and like legal of course

994
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:48,160
Uh, yeah, I think it might have been to be

995
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:54,480
Yeah, it might have been to be uh to be had like sailor moon moon on it. So I think uh

996
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Those places are really cool

997
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:09,280
Those uh, those places are really cool because they provide some anime for you for free legally so it gives them a more incentive

998
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:14,240
incentive for for everyone to uh

999
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:21,440
Uh for anime to be brought to the free to the free

1000
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:29,840
Which is really interesting because to be and like the free retro crush stuff

1001
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:32,800
Uh

1002
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:45,280
Retro crush stuff all their stuff is the same stuff as prime video. So you could just watch it for free

1003
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:53,840
YouTube also has a jp sub episodes of the og sailing moon to watch for free. Yeah, you can just do it

1004
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:59,200
I love those types of means because then like it brings anime to a wider audience for free

1005
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:03,040
And also kind of illegal so you don't have to get a slap on the wrist or

1006
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,000
feel guilt if you have such a thing

1007
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:12,080
Uh, certainly miss

1008
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:15,600
I know what you think six orders is a little much for your group

1009
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:22,240
As long as you finish it six orders of chow mein coming right up. I think I'll have to charge you next time though

1010
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:28,240
Wow, they love chow mein, huh?

1011
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:36,400
The enemy outnumbered us almost two to one. However our troops successfully engaged in blitz tactics and we tackled

1012
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:39,040
the attack the enemy

1013
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:47,600
Tenpai, thank you for the 199 super chat misaka best. I've been sailing the seas for too long

1014
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:52,320
Six orders is a lot between two people that means

1015
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:56,080
I mean three people that means

1016
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:58,640
They had to eat two bowls each

1017
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:03,200
Actually today I was really surprised some pie

1018
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:08,240
Um, I actually ate quite a bit today

1019
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:22,240
Hampton 83. Oh, yeah. Hampton. I forgot hampton is hampton strong enough to eat at all

1020
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:27,600
One by one our men had to stop but they're one by one our men had to stop

1021
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:31,920
But there was still so many of them. It wasn't for one soldier who continued her efforts

1022
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:37,440
Her firepower speed and more tactics were just too much for our enemies

1023
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,960
She finished off the last enemies with a vengeance

1024
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:46,640
For the enemy who fell to her violence met a cruel and merciless end

1025
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:49,360
Her ferocity towards the enemy

1026
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:52,720
Even drew shivers down the spines of her own allies

1027
02:23:53,680 --> 02:24:00,560
How do you like our real-time war report on the great chow man uprising? It's a crazy battle

1028
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:18,400
Oh, wait, did I miss up some readings?

1029
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:23,680
Oh, well, I didn't even notice sometimes. I just get so into it. Uh-huh

1030
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,640
I've never had chow man man before

1031
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:39,920
Wait, wait, we forgot about the reserve armies the fresh young carous and broccoli cadets her guys never had a chance

1032
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:43,440
Okay, you two that's enough

1033
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:45,840
Oh

1034
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:52,000
Everyone in curran abby eats just as much I'm sure some of them eat even more than me

1035
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:58,720
Wait, everyone in curran abby eats just as much. I'm sure some of them eat even more than me

1036
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,800
Anyhow being a medium and using crest spells takes a lot out of me and I get hungry

1037
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:11,200
All right, I was talking about food. I I surprisingly ate a lot today

1038
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:16,400
I

1039
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:21,200
Usually mama mama bought, uh, vietnamese subs

1040
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:24,320
by me

1041
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:34,720
She bought by me and I usually don't finish a whole one. I only managed to finish half

1042
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:39,040
But today I managed to finish one hold

1043
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:44,400
Hold one so I was impressed with myself

1044
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:46,560
Ha ha ha ha

1045
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,080
One whole one so I was usually usually I just um

1046
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:14,160
Papa papa eats one whole one mama eats one whole one

1047
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:17,280
But

1048
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:19,280
What are we sipping gatorade?

1049
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:22,160
I'm drinking gatorade

1050
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:31,760
I'm drinking gatorade right now g zero not the other one

1051
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:36,640
Zero sugar orange

1052
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:39,360
I

1053
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:41,920
Gamer subs not not yet

1054
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:44,160
But speaking of gamer subs

1055
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:48,720
Did you know that you could use cold mercy for 10% off your order of gamer subs?

1056
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:56,960
Use it as meh as much as you want the more you use it the closer we get as we alert to getting waifu cups and

1057
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:59,840
Maybe in the future our own

1058
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:03,840
Creator flavor

1059
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:08,640
Ha ha ha ha ha

1060
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:18,400
Remember to use 10% off

1061
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:22,960
Wait wait that was the wrong way

1062
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:31,200
Remember to use cold mercy to get 10% off your gamer subs order

1063
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:35,760
Anyways, I haven't gotten my pr package yet

1064
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:51,360
So it looks like I got lean flavor

1065
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:57,200
Uh gamer farts and

1066
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:04,960
Blow blow whole blast. I think those are the three flavors I got

1067
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:09,200
And I also got a waifu cup

1068
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:17,840
Gamer farts, yeah apparently some people say it's uh really good

1069
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:24,000
Although I although I do want to try their other flavors too. I was really interested in

1070
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:29,120
I think it was called quality that one was good

1071
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:34,400
Waifu cup of who uh, it's just their their latest season one

1072
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:38,080
I think the one is uh

1073
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:42,800
The the latest uh

1074
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:50,880
Uh the latest season one would be like this kind of like, uh boxing one

1075
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:59,680
If you check out on gamer gamer subs twitter, you should see the design. It's got like a cute

1076
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:04,000
Cute girl punching the cup and it's like cracking

1077
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:15,760
And I love and I love chow man

1078
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:19,440
Not only does it taste great, but looks yummy too

1079
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:25,280
I really enjoyed meal time at the abbey the other girls and I would just chat and eat it was so different

1080
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:31,920
At the abbey in the castle everyone just regarded me as the royalty not a real person

1081
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:34,720
I was the princess and they were my entourage

1082
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:43,360
Dinners were the worst it was all about being about the fine china and etiquette and being proper and dainty and it was lonely

1083
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:52,400
Haha

1084
02:29:54,000 --> 02:30:02,960
Although senpai um my my favorite, uh, it's like a reddish. It was a red red and black. Um gamer

1085
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:05,600
Waifu cup although, um

1086
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:11,920
I secretly really like pastel colors, so

1087
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:16,320
Secretly a whole lot actually really like pastel colors

1088
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:24,880
So I might get like a different shaker bottle and like use and keep the uh waifu cup as like a

1089
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:28,400
A memento instead

1090
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:40,160
Many phase pastel blue pink yellow something else. Uh, I like kind of the minty colors and

1091
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:43,600
Pastel yellows and pink and blues

1092
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:47,760
Honestly, if it's like full moco colors, I love it

1093
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:04,880
Because like I said full moco is my is my oh she

1094
02:31:05,360 --> 02:31:09,680
Are my oh she's sorry plural, right?

1095
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:14,240
Secretly

1096
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:33,840
Thank you for the five dollar tip anima junkie one two three you're cute and silly yandere

1097
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:36,800
I like you tip for the cute kohai. Thank you

1098
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:43,520
A secret that does not very much a secret. Yeah, I have uh

1099
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:45,680
two

1100
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:53,520
No, no three oh she's because I kind of consider like full moco as one oh she because I just can I just can't see them as

1101
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:59,600
Like separately like apart from each other because together they're you know full moco, right?

1102
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:02,560
So I consider it three

1103
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:07,120
Three oh she's but if I had to separate them that would be four

1104
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:13,840
Um

1105
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:18,640
That would be so my oh she's would be nata re sanna

1106
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:26,320
Because sanna was the first person who I watched and

1107
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:31,840
And I really um

1108
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:34,880
I

1109
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:40,880
Really I really love nata re sanna because

1110
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:44,320
Sanna is basically when I first saw sanna

1111
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:48,000
I was like maybe I could do this too and she really inspired me to try to get into v tubing

1112
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:50,720
And then I learned a lot of Japanese from her

1113
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:02,240
Like suman

1114
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:04,560
Oh

1115
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
And

1116
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:25,680
And then another vtuber who's like my oh she is

1117
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:28,560
um

1118
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:30,960
Is

1119
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:34,960
Hattoba Hattoba sugu

1120
02:33:38,320 --> 02:33:40,320
Is Hattoba sugu

1121
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:45,040
Because I don't know I thought

1122
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:50,960
I was like super admiring sugu because she was so I don't know she just reminded me of like

1123
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:58,160
Japanese cinema like tokyo story and stuff. So I was like oh my gosh. I love I love sugu

1124
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,520
She's so quiet and mysterious, you know

1125
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:05,120
The

1126
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:10,880
People the people of adai loves to see lia the princess, but no one knows anything beyond that

1127
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:13,440
What kind of food I like or anything?

1128
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:19,680
And more than ever I need to be the princess and recover the teardrop. Sometimes I miss my days at the abbey

1129
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:29,840
I think my roommate has a nata re sanna figure. I have a nata re sanna figure right here. Oh, I'm touching it

1130
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:34,800
I

1131
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:41,680
I'm touching it. I also have the nendoroid

1132
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:45,040
uh

1133
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,040
of

1134
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:49,760
Hattoba sugu as well

1135
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:52,720
But I tried to put sugu on my desk

1136
02:34:53,280 --> 02:35:00,560
And sugu's hat kept on falling because there was no magnets in it. There was no magnets in um

1137
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:02,560
In

1138
02:35:03,440 --> 02:35:05,440
In sugu's hat

1139
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:11,040
So I had to put her in a cabinet instead like one of my figure cabinets

1140
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:15,360
Because otherwise I kept on knocking her over and I felt really bad

1141
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:18,720
But sanna doesn't really knock over she has a huge base

1142
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:21,760
So she doesn't knock over like at all

1143
02:35:24,080 --> 02:35:26,080
But you know what

1144
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:30,240
Okay, I have some free time now. Are you ready to hear about the temple?

1145
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:36,160
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you guys in the middle of something?

1146
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:39,440

1156
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:39,200

Well, welcome. Hello everyone. My name is mercy modeste

1159
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:47,520
from

1160
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:49,120
violors

1161
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:52,400
gen one and dodge today. We are playing

1162
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:54,720
the

1163
02:36:54,720 --> 02:37:01,120
We're playing wild arms altercode f on ps2 with a physical copy. Yay

1164
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:06,160
This is considered a rather rare game

1165
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:16,400
This is considered a rather rare game as I believe the only way you can play it

1166
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,360
Is through a physical copy of the game

1167
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:25,920
It is a 3d remake of the original wild arms, which I do not have

1168
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:35,040
So I hope you all enjoy a little playthrough of a little bit of a game. That's uh a little bit of a game

1169
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:41,600
How am I saying a game that's a little bit hard to find

1170
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:46,240
We cannot talk about the e-word here

1171
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:50,640
I cannot talk about the e-word here

1172
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:52,880
I

1173
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:06,000
Can't talk about the e-word and no, I'm not playing playing

1174
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:18,080
I'm not playing it on an emulator. No, I'm not playing on an emulator. I am playing a

1175
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:24,480
with a ps4 run through a retro tink and yeah

1176
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:31,840
Well, this is hard to set up a little bit, but then uh now that I have

1177
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:36,640
Wait ps4

1178
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:46,800
I know I said ps2. I mean I said ps4, but I meant ps2. I'm sorry numbers are hard

1179
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:50,800
Oh

1180
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:11,700
My gosh numbers are hard, okay, uh

1181
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:20,560
On the ps2

1182
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:28,080
I just have my ps4 on the mind because I guess on my mind. I'm just like I have to bring it down

1183
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:33,120
Uh, it's run through the retro tink. It wasn't too hard to set up

1184
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:41,680
Uh, I had to watch some videos low to to set it up, but eventually I got it. I got it and then now that it's um

1185
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:43,680
Um

1186
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:47,280
Now that it's set up

1187
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:50,960
All I have to do if I want to play a different game is like to switch the hdmi

1188
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:55,520
card uh that's attached to my to my game capture

1189
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:58,320
in order to like play my

1190
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:01,680
My

1191
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:04,080
Other consoles like my switch

1192
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:07,920
Like my switch. So it's just it's a pretty easy setup

1193
02:40:08,480 --> 02:40:15,280
It's just requires crawling under the desk and like moving moving the uh cables around but that's about it

1194
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:25,680
Oh, that's sweet super easy for future ps4 games. I meant ps2

1195
02:40:27,280 --> 02:40:32,080
I meant ps2 ps4. I can just naturally just attach it to the uh

1196
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:37,280
To the uh

1197
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:43,680
Game capture, and it will naturally do it because it it doesn't have like

1198
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:48,640
The what what do you call it output? Yeah, so it'll be fine to just do it

1199
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:59,040
I mean fine to just do it, but it would be uh, but I can play like uh using this setup I can play

1200
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:01,360
um

1201
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:03,360
Gamecube

1202
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:05,360
We

1203
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:10,160
Pretty much anything else

1204
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:11,760
That you can think of

1205
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:15,040
Um, maybe I think the only thing I can't play

1206
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:24,560
Is an xbox. I don't think the x I don't think I have uh, it has the output for the xbox

1207
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:30,480
The xbox 360 I don't think I can do that

1208
02:41:30,560 --> 02:41:35,360
So I have to find a different way to play x is an xbox 360 or the original xbox

1209
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:42,480
I can't remember. Do you have all those consoles too? I do. I do have a lot of uh consoles

1210
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:49,520
That I hopefully work. I remember on the day. No, not the day like the week of

1211
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:55,680
No, the day of it was actually the day of I think um

1212
02:41:57,360 --> 02:42:01,280
I had my ps2 and I broke it wouldn't turn on

1213
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:06,000
And then I had to run out so I'm using a borrowed ps2 right now

1214
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:12,640
I was crying a little bit so after this game

1215
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:19,040
I'll probably have to have to give this ps2 back or I I beg I beg to like buy it

1216
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:26,800
I I can beg to buy it off of uh

1217
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:31,440
Off of my friend and be like blaze blaze blaze. Let me have it

1218
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:46,640
Don't break the borrowed ancient device now. I'll try not to but it feels like it's funny

1219
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:49,040
It's funny

1220
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:51,040
They loaned me

1221
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:53,600
They loaned me

1222
02:42:57,360 --> 02:43:03,840
Two ps2s and only one of the two ps2s only one of them worked

1223
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:12,560
So I got and so there's two broken ps2s right over there

1224
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:14,560
Oh

1225
02:43:17,360 --> 02:43:20,800
And I'm like why does everyone have a broken ps2

1226
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:32,320
Is it a ps2 slim no although if one was at a good price I would probably get myself a slim it just runs better

1227
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:35,520
I have

1228
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
What they call a fat boy

1229
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:40,240
Oh

1230
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:43,520
That's why you thought you had a ps4 two plus two

1231
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:50,160
There's no me to me. I love you, but you're so mean to me

1232
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:10,320
I love how my friends all like

1233
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,840
Roast me really well

1234
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:17,440
I'm like a pig spit roast

1235
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:20,720
Over a flame

1236
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:23,600
And rena's just slowly turning

1237
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:40,560
I

1238
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:47,040
Do love me

1239
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:54,240
It's really funny because um, I think I'm just

1240
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:59,680
What's the word I'm someone who's really easy to bully

1241
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:04,240
I'm someone who's really easy to bully

1242
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:10,320
What

1243
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:33,920
And I'm really easy to bully I guess it's because I'm clumsy

1244
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:36,560
where I get caught off

1245
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:41,360
Caught by surprise by a lot of things especially by my gen mates. They'll say stuff and I'm like

1246
02:45:54,160 --> 02:45:58,240
Or like Azra Azra always tries to eat me literally

1247
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:05,840
She always tries to eat me she's always like

1248
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:09,680
Yeah, I can't I can't do her voice, but I'll try

1249
02:46:10,800 --> 02:46:12,080
mercy

1250
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:13,920
you're so

1251
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:15,120
delectable

1252
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:17,360
And juicy and I'm like

1253
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:26,080
Oh

1254
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:39,360
Oh

1255
02:46:54,640 --> 02:47:01,120
You give up the vibe people wanting to bully you but they do it to get a cure reaction. That's exactly it, isn't it?

1256
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:09,040
Oh

1257
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:21,920
I always get like headpats and stuff

1258
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:29,440
Especially from the girls because they're like, oh mercy, it's okay

1259
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:35,600
It's mercy. It's okay mercy. You'll be fine. And then I'm just like

1260
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:39,200
You know just kind of in a state of shock

1261
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:50,480
Don't worry about it if you would we would like to hear about the guardians temple sure thing

1262
02:47:56,560 --> 02:47:58,080
First

1263
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:03,600
The guardians temple is north of malama right past the lake that passed the woods

1264
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:10,000
Okay, let me see what else. Okay. You probably don't know this part, but since it's not really part of the legend

1265
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:16,000
My father told me about a prayer room which only priests are allowed to enter

1266
02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:21,600
Used to tell me that or that about that room a lot. Maybe you wanted me to fall in this footsteps

1267
02:48:22,960 --> 02:48:24,960
Anyways, here's the juicy part

1268
02:48:25,360 --> 02:48:31,680
I can't escape from the word juicy. I just said it. I just said it about about azra. Is this game reading my mind?

1269
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:36,320
Oh

1270
02:48:40,480 --> 02:48:42,480
You want to listen up

1271
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:47,040
At 3 30 the door to that prayer room opens

1272
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:51,440
Pretty sure that's what he used to tell me. Is this what you guys want to know?

1273
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:54,800
It's exactly what we're looking for

1274
02:48:55,840 --> 02:49:01,280
That's great. I'm glad I can be some help to you. Why don't you stay here tonight? Don't worry. I won't charge you for it

1275
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:05,600
I

1276
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:13,200
Can't get copyright

1277
02:49:26,160 --> 02:49:28,160
Okay, now we're good, right

1278
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:41,760
I hope it's not based off of the system's time. I sure hope not

1279
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:54,720
I sure hope not

1280
02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:00,960
Oh gosh, is it somebody look that up

1281
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:05,600
So

1282
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:27,040
There's the temple

1283
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:40,240
Were you hit by copyright last game? Yeah, because I didn't uh play over it

1284
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:44,240
Hold on

1285
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:50,000
I forgot I forgot the most important thing senpai. I forgot to save

1286
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:52,800
I

1287
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:03,200
Need to go back to town and save

1288
02:51:06,080 --> 02:51:08,080
I uh

1289
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:22,400
I

1290
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:28,560
I'm

1291
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:35,760
It's something tied to the temple. Okay, good because I would be like, uh, I definitely do not want to

1292
02:51:36,880 --> 02:51:38,720
toe

1293
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:42,480
mess with the system time because that's kind of annoying

1294
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:44,640
I

1295
02:51:46,320 --> 02:51:51,520
Need to remember what game did that there was a game that I remember that does that do you senpai?

1296
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:53,520
Do you know any games that do that?

02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:59,680
Walk need to save we save at this bird

1298
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:04,400
Hello, would you like to save your progress?

1299
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:10,160
Yeah, I want to save my braggers

1300
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:20,320
Yeah, tons of stuff in pokemon. Yeah, yeah

1301
02:52:30,880 --> 02:52:38,720
Animal crossing game cube and some pokemon games. I think it was like specifically like certain pokemons will appear at certain times

1302
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:48,240
In metal gear solid three one boss would die of old age if you waited a week

1303
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:58,400
Wait, what is this? It's so cute. Wow. Look at that. It's so cute. Look at the spooky apple

1304
02:53:01,280 --> 02:53:03,280

1306
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:09,280
Oh

1308
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:21,300

This is a lot of temple

1311
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:57,520
Right handle operates the long hand

1312
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:00,240
Let's handle operates the shorthand

1313
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:03,840
point out the right spot not the

1314
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:06,800
Wrong angle. What's that mean?

1315
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:12,880
Hold on

1316
02:54:21,360 --> 02:54:23,360

Woohoo

1323
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:17,360

On my pad

02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:09,600
I bet the scarecrow is weak to fire it has to be right

1332
02:56:16,240 --> 02:56:18,240
Oh

1333
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:27,200
Wait they died already

1334
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:37,920
Scarecrow looks like a harvester. Oh remember when that I broke that game. That was good time

1335
02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:47,600
Oh

1336
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:04,720

1337
02:57:16,320 --> 02:57:26,160
Reflex reflex magic understood and that case just hit it hit

1338

Oops

1343
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:01,200
These are doors

1344
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,160
That light looks flows the true path

1345
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:09,120
Then the deceiving illusion will disappear and the door to the altar will be opened

1346
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:13,040
Light

1347
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:17,760
Light

1348
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:23,760
Light

1349
02:58:31,360 --> 02:58:33,360
Light

1350
02:58:33,360 --> 02:58:35,360
Light

1351
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:46,720
Use the fire on on the the Griffin thing

1352
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:55,840
I feel like breath mints are like gum like

1353
02:58:56,960 --> 02:58:59,920
You know like once you open a pack everyone's like can I have a gum?

1354
02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:02,560
Can I have a gum? Can I have a mint? Can I have a gum? Can I have a gum?

1355
02:59:03,360 --> 02:59:05,360
Ah

1356
02:59:12,160 --> 02:59:14,160
Can I pick one up?

1357
02:59:24,880 --> 02:59:26,880
That's blue and that's blue

1358
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:32,320
Ah sometimes sometimes I like

1359
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:39,120
When I was a fucking I was a kid

1360
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:42,160
I was a kid

1361
02:59:42,160 --> 02:59:46,720
Like I would open a bag of chips and like all these could become running going can I have a piece can I have a piece?

1362
02:59:46,720 --> 02:59:48,720
So I like crushed it

1363
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:51,440
I crushed into small

1364
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:53,760
small pieces

1365
02:59:54,480 --> 02:59:56,480
and gave it to them and

1366
02:59:57,360 --> 03:00:02,640
And then I was like you flock to me like birds and you won't eat like birds

1367
03:00:13,440 --> 03:00:15,440
Imagine

1368
03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:22,480
Like a little fucking brat just says shit to you like this

1369
03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:25,760
I

1370
03:00:44,320 --> 03:00:46,320
Can't believe I would

1371
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:49,840
I would like say shit like that

1372
03:00:50,080 --> 03:00:54,800
Oh, this is where the amnesia came from

1373
03:00:57,280 --> 03:00:59,280
Oh, thank goodness it's missed

1374
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:04,960
But it's it's gone like I love a lot

1375
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:15,040
Oh, it's wiggling

1376
03:01:20,320 --> 03:01:22,320
You

1377
03:01:26,480 --> 03:01:29,200
I know it's wiggling but I'm a little confused

1378
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:39,680
No magic

1379
03:01:42,560 --> 03:01:47,360
Okay, they both reflect they both will reflect magic so we can only do physical

1380
03:01:48,240 --> 03:01:50,240
Physical

1381
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:16,640
It just has a kick it just kicks you

1382
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
In a hole

1383
03:02:22,320 --> 03:02:24,320
I can't believe it just kicks

1384
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:44,960
Can I just pick up the light

1385
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
I

1386
03:02:51,600 --> 03:02:53,600
What's this puzzle?

1387
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:05,760
Well, it says one the deceiver will will go away, right?

1388
03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:10,880
Well, I have to do all physical moves

1389
03:03:17,360 --> 03:03:19,360

1390
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:44,960
Has to be physical moves, right?

1391
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:52,960
The light when I they said light

1392
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:58,880
I expected this see and you can't walk through them

1393
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:04,880
Oh

1394
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:07,600

Do I seriously just moved through ah

1397
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:27,440
Thank you for remembering for one month. I just realized this is happy one month. Happy one month

1398
03:04:29,280 --> 03:04:31,280
Can ambush

1399
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:34,560
I can't believe you just use a scanner and walk. That's so rude

1400
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:36,880
I

1401
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:52,160
It's like haha the light and I'm like

1402
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:57,920
Really really you're gonna be like this game

1403
03:05:01,280 --> 03:05:03,280
Oh wait, I saw birthday

1404
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:09,600
Oh, thank you, Ray kuma for gifting five

1405
03:05:16,720 --> 03:05:18,960
That's like the light of a scanner

1406
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:36,880
Oh

1407
03:05:58,080 --> 03:06:02,320
What do these gems do you have some earth gems as well, I don't know

1408
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:05,200
But I'm gonna save it

1409
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:13,040
Somebody's birthday hold on

1410
03:06:32,320 --> 03:06:34,320
Oh

1411
03:06:46,320 --> 03:06:48,320
There you go

1412
03:07:02,320 --> 03:07:04,320
I

1413
03:07:14,480 --> 03:07:23,280
Hate I hate it when they have more than one or two two boss not two bosses two monsters. Sorry. It's so annoying

1414
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:25,520
I

1415
03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:33,440
Think I did that one pretty well. I think I I played happy birthday on the automaton pretty well

1416
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:43,520
Is there is there

1417
03:07:54,240 --> 03:07:56,240
There more

1418
03:08:06,640 --> 03:08:08,640
All further right, there's a

1419
03:08:19,280 --> 03:08:22,640
There's the third door. Oh, yeah, hold on

1420
03:08:24,080 --> 03:08:34,240
There was a third door and I was I forgot about it because I'm just super forgetful

1421
03:08:40,560 --> 03:08:42,560
Literally gets nothing

1422
03:08:54,240 --> 03:09:02,960
Why does it have to have titties and no arms, what does this mean this does this make does this make this Lamia like a nugget

1423
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:18,240
Oh what nugget

1424
03:09:23,360 --> 03:09:25,360
Never heard of a nugget before

1425
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:46,400
Oh, well just to let you know a nugget is someone who has no arms and no legs

1426
03:09:54,080 --> 03:09:56,080
There's two doors

1427
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:58,800
I

1428
03:09:59,360 --> 03:10:01,360
Oh

1429
03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:21,680
I don't know. I think I was taught by

1430
03:10:22,720 --> 03:10:23,920
by

1431
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:25,360
the vila

1432
03:10:25,360 --> 03:10:27,360
the vila girls

1433
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:32,240
That uh the fetish is called is called a nugget

1434
03:10:42,800 --> 03:10:44,800
Wait fetish, yeah

1435
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:00,000
Oh

1436
03:11:08,240 --> 03:11:10,240
Kind of nugget I was taught

1437
03:11:17,680 --> 03:11:19,680
Yeah more money for guns

1438
03:11:22,400 --> 03:11:24,400
There's another one over there

1439
03:11:27,440 --> 03:11:29,440
I

1440
03:11:39,440 --> 03:11:45,760
I'm getting real tired all of the actually the run random encounter is kind of annoying, you know

1441
03:11:50,480 --> 03:11:52,480
You

1442
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
You

1443
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:07,760
What's the button to cancel them again see I don't want to use the button unless it's like a thing a time thing

1444
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:09,760
Or I need to to really do it

1445
03:12:13,680 --> 03:12:15,680
Does that make sense

1446
03:12:16,880 --> 03:12:19,120
Because like you only get a limited amount of it

1447
03:12:28,080 --> 03:12:30,080
I

1448
03:12:34,640 --> 03:12:38,320
Remember what game was so impossible to play

1449
03:12:39,520 --> 03:12:46,160
Because of the stupid random encounter it was just like every step you take it was another encounter another encounter another encounter now

1450
03:12:46,160 --> 03:12:48,160
I was just like

1451
03:12:57,520 --> 03:12:59,520
You

1452
03:13:11,600 --> 03:13:15,520
I'm getting a lot of stuff after f1

1453
03:13:27,360 --> 03:13:29,360
Oh

1454
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:52,720
It's a lot of jrbg there was one that was very

1455
03:13:52,800 --> 03:13:58,880
Particularly like annoying. I think I tried like wild arms too. I don't remember which one it was

1456
03:13:59,440 --> 03:14:02,160
I think it was one of the wild arms. I opened it and the wild

1457
03:14:02,880 --> 03:14:07,840
The like encounters just kept just kept happening and happening and I got so old mad

1458
03:14:22,800 --> 03:14:25,840
Like I kind of like Mario because the encounters don't

1459
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:31,440
They're not really random you can't avoid them, you know

1460
03:14:44,400 --> 03:14:46,400
I found it

1461
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:55,600
I

1462
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,000
Have gone back

1463
03:15:08,160 --> 03:15:15,360
Shooter dark shooter dark shooter dark how'd I say this again?

1464
03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:19,200
It's telling us something

1465
03:15:20,800 --> 03:15:25,600
Those who wish for guardians power to receive your power you must challenge your test

1466
03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:30,080
Now it's test time. It's rather old-fashioned. Oh well

1467
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:42,480
Sure earth guardian grudive his body is strong as solid to deflect bullets and magic

1468
03:15:45,360 --> 03:15:47,360
Earth guardian

1469
03:15:48,400 --> 03:15:52,240
Who will challenge the grudive trial that would be jack, right?

1470
03:15:54,800 --> 03:15:56,160
Because

1471
03:15:56,160 --> 03:16:00,160
Bullets don't don't work and magic don't work. So jack will have to slice through

1472
03:16:01,280 --> 03:16:03,280
Next is fire guardian more

1473
03:16:03,680 --> 03:16:04,720
galt

1474
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:09,920
It waves wings or terrible fire is difficult to stop the roaring blaze

1475
03:16:10,480 --> 03:16:17,280
Fire guardian who will challenge morse galt's trial?

1476
03:16:19,440 --> 03:16:21,440
Um

1477
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:33,680
Rudy

1478
03:16:39,920 --> 03:16:41,920
Um

1479
03:16:56,960 --> 03:16:58,960
Um

1480
03:16:59,600 --> 03:17:01,600
Rudy

1481
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:07,920
Lastly wind guardian fen gallon runs his claws are sharp and fast a strong wind that nobody can catch

1482
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:15,440
Oh shit, maybe maybe it should have been the other way

1483
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:33,760
They're passing this point. There's no way back turning back. Are you ready?

1484
03:17:35,520 --> 03:17:37,680
Uh reconsider the combination. Thanks

1485
03:17:40,880 --> 03:17:44,000
Can magic miss though magic misses all the time

1486
03:17:48,640 --> 03:17:52,560
But if it's as fast as wind a bullet is as fast as a wind, right?

1487
03:18:09,920 --> 03:18:11,920
Jack

1488
03:18:23,360 --> 03:18:25,360
Celia

1489
03:18:26,640 --> 03:18:28,640
Rudy

1490
03:18:29,200 --> 03:18:41,360
Yeah, so Rudy can shoot things really fast hexa Celia even has fire her main thing is fire, right?

1491
03:18:47,440 --> 03:18:49,440
Yeah, let's fucking do it

1492
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:01,680
All cracks in the plane if pressure is applied it may break

1493
03:19:05,520 --> 03:19:08,160
Oops almost again

1494
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:13,600
Uh

1495
03:19:14,880 --> 03:19:17,280
Does it start? Yeah

1496
03:19:23,440 --> 03:19:25,440
Yeah

1497
03:19:28,640 --> 03:19:30,640
Oh

1498
03:19:36,880 --> 03:19:38,880
Shit

1499
03:19:54,560 --> 03:19:56,560
It's timed

1500
03:19:59,200 --> 03:20:01,200
Oh

1501
03:20:06,720 --> 03:20:08,720
Did I fuck up

1502
03:20:23,280 --> 03:20:25,280
Did I run it

1503
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:34,160
No nothing happens when I'm running

1504
03:20:45,760 --> 03:20:47,760
Okay, maybe I should run hold on

1505
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:53,920
Fuck

1506
03:20:59,280 --> 03:21:02,640
Yes, we're good. We got it

1507
03:21:04,800 --> 03:21:08,320
I'm glad that it wasn't very picky on where the bomb for being placed

1508
03:21:15,840 --> 03:21:17,840
Oh shit

1509
03:21:28,880 --> 03:21:34,800
Oh shit, I have to literally run give me a second

1510
03:21:54,800 --> 03:21:56,800
Hang out

1511
03:21:59,280 --> 03:22:01,280
Oh

1512
03:22:22,400 --> 03:22:24,400
Fuck

1513
03:22:28,720 --> 03:22:30,720
I'm too slow

1514
03:22:38,720 --> 03:22:41,680
Okay, let's do this from another angle

1515
03:22:58,960 --> 03:23:00,960
Oh

1516
03:23:17,200 --> 03:23:19,200
Come on

1517
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,000
Oh

1518
03:23:26,240 --> 03:23:28,240
I'm too slow for this

1519
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:40,800
This is hard when I don't know this is really hard when those turns are really sharp

1520
03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:52,160
Fuck like that

1521
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:04,000
Fuck

1522
03:24:19,760 --> 03:24:24,000
Are you serious that one didn't go off

1523
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:47,200
Easier like this oh wristy hurts now

1524
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:51,760
Oh

1525
03:25:02,880 --> 03:25:05,680
My gosh how close does it have to fucking be?

1526
03:25:19,200 --> 03:25:21,200
Oh

1527
03:25:42,240 --> 03:25:44,240
Oh

1528
03:25:49,200 --> 03:25:52,000
Hey, what about

1529
03:26:19,760 --> 03:26:21,760
Fuck it why am I even like this

1530
03:26:32,320 --> 03:26:34,320
It won't fucking do it

1531
03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:43,920
Why why why are you like this?

1532
03:26:49,760 --> 03:26:51,760
Oh

1533
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:16,000
Thank goodness

1534
03:27:19,680 --> 03:27:25,520
Small one you wish for the guardians power a power too great for human hands a dangerous power

1535
03:27:26,160 --> 03:27:31,440
Just because you desire the power doesn't mean you deserve it. You must show me that you can handle it

1536
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:44,560
Oh, you're so cute die

1537
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:51,200
Oh

1538
03:28:19,360 --> 03:28:21,360
Oh

1539
03:28:37,200 --> 03:28:39,200
Small one who wishes for guardians power

1540
03:28:39,840 --> 03:28:43,840
I accept that you have the ability to receive the power of wind in your small body

1541
03:28:44,400 --> 03:28:48,000
But you control the power when you must have strength of heart

1542
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:52,080
Small one who wishes for guardians power show your heart

1543
03:28:53,280 --> 03:28:55,680
Show your strength by overcoming my test

1544
03:29:00,640 --> 03:29:02,640
Did I get it oh

1545
03:29:10,080 --> 03:29:12,080
Yippee

1546
03:29:14,720 --> 03:29:16,720
Oh

1547
03:29:40,800 --> 03:29:42,800
Once these attack everyone

1548
03:29:44,400 --> 03:29:46,400
Oh

1549
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:49,040
Literally first reaction shoot

1550
03:29:51,840 --> 03:29:57,840
You your power is different from ours as if a monster I'm scared

1551
03:30:00,800 --> 03:30:05,360
Oh wait, it's Tony from the town right hold on you yep

1552
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:08,000
Oh

1553
03:30:10,880 --> 03:30:15,600
This world needs not your existence there is no place for you in this world

1554
03:30:17,040 --> 03:30:23,760
You're a stranger in this world who is not accepted by anyone. Why do you continue fighting?

1555
03:30:25,440 --> 03:30:29,520
Why do you use your powers you think it helps others?

1556
03:30:30,320 --> 03:30:34,160
The more you use your power the more people run from you

1557
03:30:36,320 --> 03:30:42,080
The power of arm power of destruction is the power that monsters possess

1558
03:30:43,680 --> 03:30:47,040
Look at yourself your appearance you're plainly different from us

1559
03:30:53,520 --> 03:30:56,480
This is our world this is not a place for you

1560
03:30:56,480 --> 03:31:05,920
It's the blue hair I swear it's the blue hair

1561
03:31:08,720 --> 03:31:10,720
Okay

1562
03:31:17,920 --> 03:31:19,920
I'm fine

1563
03:31:19,920 --> 03:31:21,920
I

1564
03:31:36,080 --> 03:31:42,320
Cannot control this thing. Oh wait, it just opens. Okay, never mind. I don't have to run

1565
03:31:42,320 --> 03:31:50,160
I don't have to run I thought I had to run

1566
03:32:01,280 --> 03:32:03,280
Oops

1567
03:32:12,800 --> 03:32:14,800
I can take my sweet time

1568
03:32:24,640 --> 03:32:26,640
What is this

1569
03:32:29,920 --> 03:32:31,920
Oh

1570
03:32:42,720 --> 03:32:44,720
Oh

1571
03:32:45,200 --> 03:32:47,200
Oh

1572
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:49,520
Oops

1573
03:33:00,480 --> 03:33:02,480
Okay

1574
03:33:11,920 --> 03:33:13,920
Oh wait, hold on

1575
03:33:14,880 --> 03:33:16,880
This one looks shorter

1576
03:33:20,880 --> 03:33:24,400
This one looks shorter I didn't notice it was shorter

1577
03:33:24,400 --> 03:33:44,000
There we go, and then we send ham pond

1578
03:33:50,720 --> 03:33:52,720
I think I can get ham pond

1579
03:33:54,960 --> 03:33:56,960
Maybe

1580
03:34:20,160 --> 03:34:22,160
Wait

1581
03:34:24,560 --> 03:34:28,800
I'm buttons stay pressed

1582
03:34:37,120 --> 03:34:39,360
Oh, they don't need to be pressed at the same time, okay

1583
03:34:39,360 --> 03:34:57,520
It's easier because ham pond can jump over gaps

1584
03:35:02,880 --> 03:35:04,880
Oh, I just have to be on this side

1585
03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:11,600
Oh

1586
03:35:13,200 --> 03:35:15,200
I think

1587
03:35:16,480 --> 03:35:18,480
No

1588
03:35:21,920 --> 03:35:23,920
Maybe has to be together

1589
03:35:30,000 --> 03:35:32,000
The gap too big

1590
03:35:39,920 --> 03:35:41,920
I

1591
03:35:46,160 --> 03:35:48,160
Maybe like that

1592
03:35:56,560 --> 03:35:58,560
Yeah

1593
03:35:59,280 --> 03:36:01,280
I

1594
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:10,320
Thought I had to do it at the same time so I started going things small and you wish for the guardian's power

1595
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:14,320
Power too great for human hands a dangerous power

1596
03:36:14,960 --> 03:36:19,600
Just because you desire the power doesn't mean you deserve it much first show me that you can handle it

1597
03:36:21,920 --> 03:36:24,560
Oh jack was way easier than rooties

1598
03:36:28,560 --> 03:36:30,560
Oh

1599
03:36:59,520 --> 03:37:01,520
Oh

1600
03:37:15,200 --> 03:37:17,200
That would not do much at all

1601
03:37:20,800 --> 03:37:22,800
Small one that wishes for guardians power

1602
03:37:23,440 --> 03:37:27,360
I accept that you have the ability to receive earth power in your small body

1603
03:37:28,080 --> 03:37:29,200
but

1604
03:37:29,200 --> 03:37:32,240
To control my earthly powers. You must have strength of heart

1605
03:37:33,200 --> 03:37:36,480
Small one who wishes for guardians power show your heart

1606
03:37:37,280 --> 03:37:40,160
Show your strength by overcoming my test

1607
03:37:47,440 --> 03:37:49,440
May I level up

1608
03:37:51,360 --> 03:37:53,360
No

1609
03:37:54,320 --> 03:37:57,360
Nifty big stomp

1610
03:38:05,600 --> 03:38:08,320
Oh my gosh, he has to is so loud right now

1611
03:38:16,640 --> 03:38:18,640
What a tuney looking ass sword

1612
03:38:24,000 --> 03:38:27,760
This is great workout as long as I have this power

1613
03:38:28,320 --> 03:38:33,040
I'll never have to run from anyone this magic sword. I will cut away my disgusting past

1614
03:38:33,680 --> 03:38:35,680
This is absolute power

1615
03:38:36,480 --> 03:38:38,480
Wow

1616
03:38:38,800 --> 03:38:40,800
I'm blind

1617
03:38:41,120 --> 03:38:43,120
Oh

1618
03:38:52,720 --> 03:38:54,800
Who is it stop hiding and show yourself

1619
03:38:58,320 --> 03:39:01,600
No, it can't be he is the guy from the beginning

1620
03:39:02,720 --> 03:39:04,720
You are a man who ran away

1621
03:39:05,040 --> 03:39:09,040
A man without courage a man who hopes for power a man addicted to power

1622
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:13,440
I never withdrew myself. My heart was never broken in battle

1623
03:39:16,800 --> 03:39:21,200
But you ran away deserted your unit and ran away

1624
03:39:24,400 --> 03:39:26,400
Ran from your responsibility

1625
03:39:28,080 --> 03:39:31,520
And from yourself didn't you run away?

1626
03:39:32,640 --> 03:39:34,640
What what are you saying?

1627
03:39:35,040 --> 03:39:39,440
You're not running away then can you say it can you tell us your name?

1628
03:39:42,080 --> 03:39:48,000
Yes, what you're doing is just a self justification. Why don't you see the truth?

1629
03:39:52,320 --> 03:39:57,920
You still use the sword for destruction, but you cannot use the sword to protect what you hold dear

1630
03:39:58,400 --> 03:40:00,400
I

1631
03:40:03,520 --> 03:40:06,160
Know I know that but I'm trying to

1632
03:40:07,200 --> 03:40:09,200
I need power for revenge

1633
03:40:10,080 --> 03:40:16,080
Wait until absolute unit. I'm ain't absolute power. Please wait. Just wait wait

1634
03:40:19,840 --> 03:40:24,480
Do I have to be left alone again? I am I am

1635
03:40:27,920 --> 03:40:32,880
Hahaha absolute unit. Oops. I'm an absolute power

1636
03:40:36,000 --> 03:40:38,000
Corrupts absolutely

1637
03:40:58,000 --> 03:41:13,120
Please do not make me fall again. I will cry

1638
03:41:17,760 --> 03:41:19,760
I will cry I will cry

1639
03:41:28,720 --> 03:41:30,720
I

1640
03:41:45,520 --> 03:41:49,840
Need I need okay, hold on. I might need a different angle. This is too hard for me

1641
03:41:58,320 --> 03:42:00,320
You

1642
03:42:05,760 --> 03:42:07,760
Excuse me

1643
03:42:09,680 --> 03:42:11,680
Fuck

1644
03:42:11,680 --> 03:42:13,680
Oh

1645
03:42:27,920 --> 03:42:29,920
Come on

1646
03:42:35,920 --> 03:42:38,800
Why did jack have the easiest one what the hell?

1647
03:42:41,680 --> 03:42:43,680
Oh

1648
03:43:03,760 --> 03:43:06,260
Why is hers is always the hardest

1649
03:43:12,320 --> 03:43:14,320
Oh

1650
03:43:15,920 --> 03:43:17,920
Thank fucking god

1651
03:43:18,000 --> 03:43:24,080
Small one you wish for the guardians power a power too great for human hands a dangerous power

1652
03:43:24,640 --> 03:43:29,680
Just because you desire the power doesn't mean you deserve it. You must first show me that you can handle it

1653
03:43:29,680 --> 03:43:31,680
I

1654
03:43:40,400 --> 03:43:42,400
That's a big ass dragon

1655
03:43:47,360 --> 03:43:49,360
Big fire

1656
03:43:54,640 --> 03:43:56,640
I don't think that's gonna do much

1657
03:44:00,640 --> 03:44:02,640
I

1658
03:44:18,560 --> 03:44:20,880
Why did you heal you lost nothing?

1659
03:44:29,920 --> 03:44:31,920
I

1660
03:44:37,440 --> 03:44:39,440
Small one who wishes for guardians power

1661
03:44:40,080 --> 03:44:44,000
Except that you have the ability to receive the power of fire in your small body

1662
03:44:44,480 --> 03:44:47,600
But control my fire. You must have strength of heart

1663
03:44:48,320 --> 03:44:51,600
Small one who wishes for guardians power show your heart

1664
03:44:52,640 --> 03:44:55,280
Show your strength by overcoming my test

1665
03:44:56,880 --> 03:44:58,880
Okay, that was so easy

1666
03:44:59,680 --> 03:45:01,680
I just zapped it once

1667
03:45:01,920 --> 03:45:06,240
I think you have to show like two moves or like three moves and it's like, okay, you're done

1668
03:45:19,680 --> 03:45:21,680
I she not in a little creepy place

1669
03:45:21,680 --> 03:45:31,120
It's impossible this castle. Why am I at aldehyde castle?

1670
03:45:35,840 --> 03:45:40,320
A princess goes on a journey to save the world you must much obliged

1671
03:45:44,320 --> 03:45:50,080
But you are the prince of the princess of aldehyde nothing more you must fulfill your duty

1672
03:45:52,560 --> 03:45:57,040
I know I understand that it's my choice. I'm

1673
03:45:58,560 --> 03:46:02,240
Nobody in this castle calls your name. You are not wanted

1674
03:46:03,520 --> 03:46:07,600
Huh, I will not accept such a thing. I do not want to think that

1675
03:46:09,520 --> 03:46:11,520
You know that is the truth

1676
03:46:11,680 --> 03:46:14,640
You are not loved by anyone. Why are you surprised?

1677
03:46:15,200 --> 03:46:21,120
What a fucking lie. What a fucking lie. Everyone's like, oh the princess. We love you princess

1678
03:46:22,000 --> 03:46:29,280
But you are me. I am thou and thou art I

1679
03:46:29,280 --> 03:46:31,280
I

1680
03:46:50,080 --> 03:46:56,640
Or I like my favorite, who are you? Who are you? I'm you what's stronger

1681
03:47:00,240 --> 03:47:07,520
You went off in a dangerous journey why for love to fulfill your duty as a princess why

1682
03:47:11,440 --> 03:47:17,200
The truth is you just wanted someone to worry someone to confirm you were loved

1683
03:47:19,040 --> 03:47:23,360
You let for danger you cut your hair in front of everyone everything was selfish

1684
03:47:24,720 --> 03:47:29,120
You sing for peace in the middle of a broken city in hopes of receiving someone's love

1685
03:47:29,280 --> 03:47:31,280
You

1686
03:47:32,960 --> 03:47:34,960
Are a terrible

1687
03:47:35,760 --> 03:47:37,760
I think she's a pretty good princess

1688
03:47:38,400 --> 03:47:42,960
I'm sorry. I thought she was pretty good. I mean it was all jack's fault anyway in that balloon

1689
03:47:46,240 --> 03:47:50,400
Brain worms hit brain worms be hitting different

1690
03:47:52,160 --> 03:47:55,520
You know, I feel like she's been a pretty decent princess. Yeah

1691
03:47:55,520 --> 03:48:04,560
My thoughts and my behavior, are they wrong? Are they not pure? Please someone tell me

1692
03:48:08,880 --> 03:48:14,640
It's impossible because nobody loves you just accept it

1693
03:48:14,880 --> 03:48:16,880
You

1694
03:48:20,960 --> 03:48:24,640
Like it was like partly jack's fault and then like the balloons

1695
03:48:27,280 --> 03:48:33,760
And then we blame everyone who manufactured that balloon afterwards, but like yeah brain worms got hands

1696
03:48:35,440 --> 03:48:38,560
Senpai you are loved by me

1697
03:48:41,280 --> 03:48:43,280
Aggressive

1698
03:48:44,640 --> 03:48:53,520
You must realize you do not have the ability to love anyone don't look to me for empathy

1699
03:49:14,640 --> 03:49:18,160
We uh appreciate some aggression in our love you do

1700
03:49:21,040 --> 03:49:26,240
Sturder dark shaman and her warriors why are your hearts so weak

1701
03:49:28,240 --> 03:49:33,440
These guys were like wow you guys are fucking bussies. What the fuck

1702
03:49:34,080 --> 03:49:40,160
Cowards weaklings. Do you love me enough to put me in a hydraulic press three?

1703
03:49:40,160 --> 03:49:46,960
Thank you. He's after died you for the 10. Um

1704
03:49:49,600 --> 03:49:52,800
I don't want you to put in you in the hydraulic press

1705
03:49:55,440 --> 03:49:57,440
But

1706
03:50:00,240 --> 03:50:02,240
You know

1707
03:50:03,360 --> 03:50:07,760
If that's what true love is and that's what you really want I'll do it

1708
03:50:10,160 --> 03:50:12,160
for love

1709
03:50:26,400 --> 03:50:28,800
What about a different kind of press you want me

1710
03:50:31,280 --> 03:50:35,920
To any of us you if that's what you really want

1711
03:50:35,920 --> 03:50:40,560
Then I will oblige

1712
03:50:51,040 --> 03:50:55,520
The test of guardians wait the test of guardians assigned us did we not pass

1713
03:50:57,040 --> 03:50:59,680
Decay of the world means decay in people's hearts

1714
03:51:00,880 --> 03:51:02,880
It makes us wonder

1715
03:51:02,880 --> 03:51:07,760
Is it wise for us to place our power in the world's fate under your charge?

1716
03:51:18,160 --> 03:51:22,960
They say such selfish things I showed my power to the guardians why are they not satisfied with it?

1717
03:51:25,440 --> 03:51:31,440
But we are the powerless existence we lost most of our power to hold this world the heart is too weak

1718
03:51:33,840 --> 03:51:35,840
The guardians voice

1719
03:51:36,960 --> 03:51:40,640
It reached my heart, but this this is not only their voice

1720
03:51:41,840 --> 03:51:43,440
heart

1721
03:51:43,440 --> 03:51:47,120
The guardians heart is felt in my heart along with their voice

1722
03:51:47,920 --> 03:51:51,360
Their hearts anger sorrow disappointment and resignation

1723
03:51:52,720 --> 03:51:54,720
These are what fills my heart

1724
03:51:55,920 --> 03:51:57,920
I'm sick of listening to this nonsense

1725
03:51:58,480 --> 03:52:05,040
Except the strength of my sword or I will make you up except it gosh so aggressive

1726
03:52:06,480 --> 03:52:13,360
Jack I know I have like a little aggressiveness, but this is like you know another another level

1727
03:52:20,480 --> 03:52:27,360
It's like oh you're gonna beat up these stained glasses. Oh look at these stained glasses. They're so pretty and sparkly

1728
03:52:28,880 --> 03:52:30,880
Oh

1729
03:52:35,040 --> 03:52:37,040
This man is too fucking to me

1730
03:52:45,280 --> 03:52:51,120
Your false bravado your rowing anger they are the evidence of your weak heart

1731
03:52:51,120 --> 03:52:59,120
Your hearts are so weak with such weak hearts you cannot confront the threat now

1732
03:53:00,880 --> 03:53:05,920
But we do not have power or a way to confront the threat either the guy I must accept his fate

1733
03:53:07,280 --> 03:53:10,240
Wait a minute. You can't just judge the strength of our hearts

1734
03:53:11,120 --> 03:53:12,560
I can

1735
03:53:12,560 --> 03:53:14,320
You're a little

1736
03:53:14,320 --> 03:53:18,320
Bitch baby. You're always gonna be a little bitch, baby. Hello

1737
03:53:18,560 --> 03:53:22,640
Hello, bitch baby cry baby snot nose little bitch

1738
03:53:34,480 --> 03:53:39,040
It was enough to see that humans do not have the power to fight with monsters

1739
03:53:42,400 --> 03:53:45,520
Don't do my man dirty like that. It was 10% his fault

1740
03:53:49,120 --> 03:53:51,120
That's that's me real

1741
03:53:55,760 --> 03:53:57,760
Without fighting power

1742
03:53:59,120 --> 03:54:03,600
How can you hope to save a gaya? How can you take the teardrop back?

1743
03:54:05,040 --> 03:54:07,040
Teardrop, how did you know?

1744
03:54:08,480 --> 03:54:12,800
You do not need to tell us we guardians. No we can feel it

1745
03:54:18,640 --> 03:54:24,080
He doesn't need the toxic kohai experience everyone needs the toxic kohai experience

1746
03:54:27,280 --> 03:54:29,280
I am the true guardian here

1747
03:54:35,120 --> 03:54:42,720
The brilliance of the teardrop is in a sense the heart of this of this star so it connects the life and the star

1748
03:54:48,880 --> 03:54:50,880
Oh

1749
03:54:51,200 --> 03:54:55,840
We need it. Well, just senpai you want me to insult you?

1750
03:55:04,000 --> 03:55:06,000
Um

1751
03:55:09,840 --> 03:55:11,840
Yeah, no, okay

1752
03:55:12,640 --> 03:55:18,880
Only mildly pleased because I was like I can go pretty hard but that might be bad

1753
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:27,440
Negative affirmation ASMR I don't think I would do that because

1754
03:55:28,400 --> 03:55:33,440
Frankly to say it I feel like a lot of people have like extreme brain worms

1755
03:55:34,560 --> 03:55:36,240
like

1756
03:55:36,240 --> 03:55:40,080
To the point where it's so unhealthy that I feel like

1757
03:55:41,040 --> 03:55:43,040
You know

1758
03:55:48,320 --> 03:55:50,320
I feel like um

1759
03:55:52,240 --> 03:55:56,800
If I perpetuate that it can get to like dangerous levels does that make sense

1760
03:56:02,000 --> 03:56:04,000
Which is why I don't want to do that

1761
03:56:05,360 --> 03:56:07,360
Which is why I'm telling

1762
03:56:08,320 --> 03:56:16,320
Is why I'm telling my senpais like things like let's go volunteering let's make the world a better place

1763
03:56:22,720 --> 03:56:28,080
Because doing stuff sometimes doing stuff for others makes the brain worms go away

1764
03:56:28,080 --> 03:56:30,080
Hey

1765
03:56:35,120 --> 03:56:40,080
A teardrop is the very essence the life of the star now life with Ogaea

1766
03:56:42,320 --> 03:56:48,720
I mean the monsters will use teardrop to put an end to life on the star that is correct

1767
03:56:51,760 --> 03:56:54,880
They intend to revive a great demon named mother

1768
03:56:55,760 --> 03:56:57,040
mothers

1769
03:56:57,120 --> 03:56:58,320
mother

1770
03:56:58,320 --> 03:57:00,800
Excuse me mother. You're in the wrong game

1771
03:57:02,960 --> 03:57:04,960
This is the wrong game

1772
03:57:19,280 --> 03:57:22,080
By using the life the teardrop releases

1773
03:57:23,040 --> 03:57:27,440
It will mark the beginning of monsters and say no the end of this world

1774
03:57:31,680 --> 03:57:34,400
Mother the name of their boss

1775
03:57:35,920 --> 03:57:41,120
Chamin even though your heart is weak you must ask do you wish for guardians power?

1776
03:57:42,560 --> 03:57:47,840
I am a human with a weak heart. I know this. I always have and for this reason

1777
03:57:48,560 --> 03:57:50,560
I wish to go to grow strong

1778
03:57:51,360 --> 03:57:54,400
Guardians power that rules this world. I

1779
03:57:55,280 --> 03:57:57,280
I wish for the power

1780
03:57:57,680 --> 03:58:00,560
You made a fool of us shut the fuck up

1781
03:58:02,560 --> 03:58:04,560
Shut the fuck up jack

1782
03:58:06,480 --> 03:58:09,840
People are talking right now. It's not your turn

1783
03:58:12,000 --> 03:58:15,600
I can at least be mean to jack because jack's not real

1784
03:58:18,240 --> 03:58:20,240
Ah

1785
03:58:37,200 --> 03:58:39,840
You wish for power because of your weak heart

1786
03:58:40,560 --> 03:58:46,480
Let's not waste any time since mother's resurrection is approaching fast. Chamin. We will place our power with you

1787
03:58:47,920 --> 03:58:52,800
Before mother awakes before monsters unify their power and hearts into one

1788
03:58:53,680 --> 03:58:58,320
We will transfer you to the monsters castle within earth with our remaining power

1789
03:59:00,000 --> 03:59:02,000
Was that possible?

1790
03:59:02,320 --> 03:59:04,320
We can because we are guardians

1791
03:59:04,640 --> 03:59:09,280
Follow the brilliant teardrop and fly to the land covered with snow and terror

1792
03:59:09,280 --> 03:59:15,280
Senpai's name jack. They're fine

1793
03:59:16,160 --> 03:59:18,160
Senpai's name jack. I love you

1794
03:59:18,960 --> 03:59:21,360
But this this jack, uh

1795
03:59:23,760 --> 03:59:25,760
Nah

1796
03:59:26,080 --> 03:59:30,240
When you get your sight back you'll be in the monsters castle

1797
03:59:31,200 --> 03:59:33,680
Chamin you must transform our power

1798
03:59:34,320 --> 03:59:36,320
incarnate the heart to power

1799
03:59:36,720 --> 03:59:40,480
We guardians will become your power to destroy the steel menace

1800
03:59:41,600 --> 03:59:43,600
With our last remaining ability

1801
03:59:45,600 --> 03:59:48,080
Take the teardrop back from the demon's hand

1802
03:59:49,520 --> 03:59:50,960
Is the only

1803
03:59:50,960 --> 03:59:56,480
Wait taking the teardrop back from the demon's hand is the only hope of saving this world's future

1804
04:00:07,280 --> 04:00:12,880
This is the guardians temple. We didn't reach the monsters castle, but why?

1805
04:00:14,320 --> 04:00:16,320
This impact is pain

1806
04:00:16,960 --> 04:00:18,960
You shall never forget

1807
04:00:18,960 --> 04:00:22,160
the stroke of zek fraz zek freeds

1808
04:00:22,800 --> 04:00:24,800
dark spear

1809
04:00:25,600 --> 04:00:27,600
With our remaining power

1810
04:00:28,160 --> 04:00:31,520
It's not possible to transfer you to the monsters castle

1811
04:00:31,920 --> 04:00:36,480
You're away anyway. Can't we do anything about it?

1812
04:00:40,640 --> 04:00:47,200
When hope collapsed the future did our power collapsed and now it's a miracle to destroy monsters

1813
04:00:48,800 --> 04:00:50,640
Ah again

1814
04:00:50,640 --> 04:00:52,640
Indeed a miracle if it is soul

1815
04:00:53,600 --> 04:00:56,560
We should place our last hope in this in these humans

1816
04:00:57,760 --> 04:00:59,760
Chamin and warriors

1817
04:01:00,000 --> 04:01:05,600
We four guardians will try once more by unifying our mere remaining power

1818
04:01:06,720 --> 04:01:08,720
The destination is a sealed land

1819
04:01:10,000 --> 04:01:12,000
Island where mother is held

1820
04:01:12,880 --> 04:01:16,400
The wicked place where the demons will resurrect mother

1821
04:01:17,280 --> 04:01:20,000
A dire fate awaits if not stopped

1822
04:01:21,360 --> 04:01:23,760
The teardrop is the brilliance of life

1823
04:01:24,800 --> 04:01:26,800
Is is the

1824
04:01:26,800 --> 04:01:33,120
Desecration it is a desecration to use it for mother's resurrection

1825
04:01:38,160 --> 04:01:40,160
I had to I had to win for that

1826
04:01:42,160 --> 04:01:44,160
Where the fuck are we?

1827
04:01:56,880 --> 04:02:08,480
Guardians damn them they not only spy on us but transfer humans to our castle

1828
04:02:10,480 --> 04:02:12,480
They're transfer

1829
04:02:13,440 --> 04:02:16,320
You pierce their powers with your terrible dark spear

1830
04:02:17,280 --> 04:02:19,280
Okay, you're kind of hot

1831
04:02:19,760 --> 04:02:21,760
And cute wait

1832
04:02:21,760 --> 04:02:26,480
You're the you're the girl you're the girl from the beginning. You're the the lady of the sword

1833
04:02:27,760 --> 04:02:34,400
You're the lady sword. Yeah, lady sword person. Yeah the intro law person

1834
04:02:37,040 --> 04:02:39,040
Looks like she's a bad guy now

1835
04:02:40,880 --> 04:02:45,280
Even though the human guardians finally claim in contact what are you going to do?

1836
04:02:49,440 --> 04:02:56,720
Those who forget those no, what was the voice I did those who forget how to fight can only leave them to their

1837
04:02:56,800 --> 04:02:58,160
destruction

1838
04:02:58,160 --> 04:03:03,840
What do you think of bugaya the world of decay and waste a land of weaklings who dare not fight?

1839
04:03:05,760 --> 04:03:07,760
Humans elu

1840
04:03:07,920 --> 04:03:09,600
and guardians

1841
04:03:09,600 --> 04:03:13,840
Are there any who would stand up to us would dare to confront us?

1842
04:03:14,720 --> 04:03:20,640
No, the answer is definitely no humans cannot do anything the guardians do not frighten us either

1843
04:03:21,600 --> 04:03:23,600
Oh

1844
04:03:26,800 --> 04:03:31,600
There's all hazad here you are absolutely right

1845
04:03:32,800 --> 04:03:36,800
However, there's another worrisome resistance power the elu

1846
04:03:38,160 --> 04:03:40,160
There

1847
04:03:41,440 --> 04:03:43,440
There

1848
04:03:44,800 --> 04:03:47,520
Their existence is being researched

1849
04:03:48,480 --> 04:03:50,480
Anyways look there

1850
04:03:52,560 --> 04:03:57,040
Here oopsies the big game

1851
04:04:00,560 --> 04:04:03,840
We met this guy he was killing everyone in the intro

1852
04:04:07,040 --> 04:04:12,560
They might have been destroyed in the past thousand years you could not confirm their existence

1853
04:04:13,200 --> 04:04:19,200
Although there are some evidence mostly broken junk buried under soil

1854
04:04:27,680 --> 04:04:35,040
Once I stand wait once I stand the frontline of this war there is no chance of winning for them

1855
04:04:36,560 --> 04:04:41,280
It's funny to see the weak running their screens make me laugh

1856
04:04:42,560 --> 04:04:44,560
Ha ha ha

1857
04:04:44,880 --> 04:04:50,640
But I long for a worthy opponent attack of how to hide it was too easy

1858
04:04:54,560 --> 04:05:01,280
A truly strong fighter could have taken the teardrop without all that needless wanton destruction

1859
04:05:03,040 --> 04:05:06,080
What what are you saying? How dare you say such a thing to me?

1860
04:05:06,320 --> 04:05:08,320
Oh

1861
04:05:08,880 --> 04:05:15,360
Yeah, it totally looks like a job or next to everyone else, huh? This is a battlefield

1862
04:05:17,200 --> 04:05:21,520
What the strong does is justice you should be punished for your mouth

1863
04:05:29,040 --> 04:05:31,040
Stop it berserk you two harken

1864
04:05:31,120 --> 04:05:33,120
Let us

1865
04:05:33,920 --> 04:05:42,080
Prosper us have proper silence while we await mother's awakening. Yes the calm before the storm

1866
04:05:44,560 --> 04:05:50,560
Here are the gathered are here those are gathered are four nights the dream we have is one

1867
04:05:51,520 --> 04:05:54,960
Have mother awaken as our glorious leader once again

1868
04:05:55,840 --> 04:05:58,080
The guardians disgusting seals

1869
04:05:58,880 --> 04:06:02,400
Here three of them who would release the first seal?

1870
04:06:08,000 --> 04:06:09,840
The honor

1871
04:06:09,840 --> 04:06:15,520
The honor will be mine. I will step up. I shall have the utmost honor in breaking the first seal

1872
04:06:16,240 --> 04:06:22,320
Don't make those humans who can contact the guardians my target. Don't meddle with this anyone

1873
04:06:23,600 --> 04:06:25,600
I don't remember what voice I did

1874
04:06:26,080 --> 04:06:32,640
Not gonna lie to you. I kind of wanted to do chatterbox's voice, but I can't do chatterbox's voice

1875
04:06:36,720 --> 04:06:44,720
Well, well my amusement will be stolen by him a mighty berserk is in high spirits. Yeah, my god

1876
04:06:49,280 --> 04:06:52,240
What I want is not honor nor cheap satisfaction

1877
04:06:52,480 --> 04:06:57,600
It's something I do not have a battle for life and death

1878
04:07:02,400 --> 04:07:07,920
When mother awakens all who live in bogeye will sleep and never rise

1879
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:13,360
When the time comes we knights will stand as rulers of this world

1880
04:07:14,240 --> 04:07:16,240
We shall be one

1881
04:07:22,560 --> 04:07:24,560
Ah

1882
04:07:24,800 --> 04:07:26,800
My fucking eyes

1883
04:07:33,520 --> 04:07:41,520
Oh, it's harkens true identity already spoiled we kind of figured that harkin is already like the girl from the intro

1884
04:07:41,760 --> 04:07:51,920
What was it the the lady of the sword or something

1885
04:08:01,760 --> 04:08:09,040
Wait like Nikkei chatterbox. Yeah, I mean he kind of looks like chatterbox, but more like fish chatterbox

1886
04:08:09,040 --> 04:08:13,280
Ouch, where am I?

1887
04:08:16,800 --> 04:08:22,160
A sealed place the guardians told us they would try to transport us there

1888
04:08:24,160 --> 04:08:29,120
And at the sealed place we must stop mother's revival. That's all they said

1889
04:08:30,640 --> 04:08:37,600
It's okay to fight against evil, but being bossed around by the guardians is how on how to protect the world. I don't like that

1890
04:08:40,000 --> 04:08:42,080
Obtained hero

1891
04:08:44,320 --> 04:08:49,760
Obtained medium fiery wage obtained medium gale claw

1892
04:08:53,680 --> 04:09:01,200
This medium thank you rude if you more galt and gallon

1893
04:09:05,760 --> 04:09:07,760
Thank you for giving me your powers

1894
04:09:09,840 --> 04:09:18,160
And to the northwest is a hidden town it is called basker village

1895
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:21,440
The basket is our world protectors

1896
04:09:22,480 --> 04:09:25,760
Listen to their advice and stop the demons mother's revival

1897
04:09:28,080 --> 04:09:30,080
Aha, that's nice and all but uh

1898
04:09:30,400 --> 04:09:40,400
That was a plot twist completely spoiled. Oops

1899
04:09:40,400 --> 04:09:42,400
Yes

1900
04:09:58,160 --> 04:10:00,160
You again

1901
04:10:04,240 --> 04:10:06,240
Run away you coward

1902
04:10:10,560 --> 04:10:13,060
I love guns so much gun is so good

04:13:34,160 --> 04:13:36,160
uh

1935
04:13:37,280 --> 04:13:39,280
I

1936
04:13:42,480 --> 04:13:50,160
Don't think it's a game that you can easily find and there's no like digital copy of it. I believe

1937
04:13:51,040 --> 04:13:54,480
So it's a pretty rare game and I have a physical copy. Yeah

1938
04:13:56,480 --> 04:13:59,520
It's a remake of the first wild arms

1939
04:14:00,720 --> 04:14:02,720
But it's uh

1940
04:14:02,880 --> 04:14:04,880
It's like a 3d remake

1941
04:14:05,520 --> 04:14:07,520
Yeah

1942
04:14:07,520 --> 04:14:09,520
And it was released in uh

1943
04:14:10,960 --> 04:14:15,680
2005 to the north american market. I think

1944
04:14:16,640 --> 04:14:22,080
Oh, well, but yeah, it's a pretty rare game a little bit hard to find so i'm glad that I can play it

1945
04:14:22,720 --> 04:14:24,720
With everyone

1946
04:14:30,160 --> 04:14:32,160
Nah

1947
04:14:34,880 --> 04:14:36,880
Oh

1948
04:14:37,120 --> 04:14:42,000
The us game or a japanese game it a japanese game

1949
04:14:44,080 --> 04:14:48,720
But like, you know, yeah

1950
04:14:55,360 --> 04:15:01,520
But like, you know, it didn't yeah, this is the us release or north american release

1951
04:15:05,680 --> 04:15:11,120
Look I can open open the little disc thing and it comes with the bonus anime dvd

1952
04:15:12,400 --> 04:15:18,640
It contains episode one of the wild arms anime series

1953
04:15:27,280 --> 04:15:29,280
Yeah

1954
04:15:30,160 --> 04:15:36,640
The anime good from what I heard no

1955
04:15:39,840 --> 04:15:44,480
No, I heard the the anime was not good

1956
04:15:51,680 --> 04:15:56,320
But yeah, it's a bit of a rare game and I'm happy to have it

1957
04:15:59,280 --> 04:16:05,680
I already saved I'm gonna do it again. I don't trust myself

1958
04:16:17,200 --> 04:16:23,120
Sometimes I feel like some anime adaptations are pretty good and some are not that good

1959
04:16:23,520 --> 04:16:32,160
But there is an anime adaptation. I really like uh, so, you know, devil may cry or they may not cry. I don't know

1960
04:16:37,120 --> 04:16:42,080
Um that anime is bad, but I really like it

1961
04:16:45,120 --> 04:16:47,120
I don't know. I just enjoy

1962
04:16:47,440 --> 04:16:49,440
Uh

1963
04:16:50,640 --> 04:16:59,120
I enjoy that what's his face really loves strawberry sundaes and I feel like that should be a that's just like really great

1964
04:17:02,960 --> 04:17:06,160
Yeah Dante yeah Dante eating uh

1965
04:17:07,200 --> 04:17:09,200
eating tons of

1966
04:17:09,440 --> 04:17:11,440
of strawberry sundaes

1967
04:17:12,160 --> 04:17:18,240
And pizza doesn't eat pizza in the games. I don't think he has strawberry sundaes

1968
04:17:25,600 --> 04:17:28,240
Yeah in the game he likes pizza, but I don't think it ever

1969
04:17:29,040 --> 04:17:30,880
showed that he had like

1970
04:17:30,880 --> 04:17:33,120
a strawberry sundae obsession

1971
04:17:35,520 --> 04:17:39,680
And then I like the little girl that like takes along with him in the anime too. I don't know it's just

1972
04:17:42,160 --> 04:17:44,160
Oh

1973
04:17:46,400 --> 04:17:48,400
That's always like fun for me

1974
04:17:51,920 --> 04:17:53,920
Patty yeah

1975
04:17:55,840 --> 04:18:02,080
The only thing I remember from the anime is him ordering a strawberry sundae in a bar. Yeah, and then the the bar

1976
04:18:05,360 --> 04:18:07,360
Pender is like

1977
04:18:07,680 --> 04:18:12,800
Only makes only keeps like the ingredients for strawberry sundaes there for him

1978
04:18:14,640 --> 04:18:16,640
I don't know. I thought that was cute. I was like, oh

1979
04:18:18,000 --> 04:18:22,640
Ordering strawberry sundaes in a bar. I want a strawberry sundae now

1980
04:18:29,120 --> 04:18:33,360
He's canon character in the games too funny enough really I thought it was good

1981
04:18:33,680 --> 04:18:40,560
It's like the butterfly pt for kohai. Yeah, it's so good

1982
04:18:41,360 --> 04:18:43,760
the the single drink that uh

1983
04:18:44,720 --> 04:18:47,360
It's summer though. It's summer. I went to another store

1984
04:18:47,840 --> 04:18:54,080
Uh the same brand of boba and they were like they had they had that drink again

1985
04:18:54,080 --> 04:19:00,160
And I was like it's a summer drink. It's back and better than ever and I want to sip. I want to sip it

1986
04:19:03,600 --> 04:19:05,600
I want bubble tea

1987
04:19:06,640 --> 04:19:08,640
I want bubble tea down

1988
04:19:12,640 --> 04:19:16,240
I want bubble tea again now I'm now I know I have cravings

1989
04:19:18,480 --> 04:19:20,480
Now I have cravings again

1990
04:19:22,080 --> 04:19:23,920
It's so late now

1991
04:19:23,920 --> 04:19:28,880
The all if if I have that craving like maybe like a few hours earlier

1992
04:19:29,280 --> 04:19:33,600
The place that I I really like opens until like 10 10 p.m

1993
04:19:44,800 --> 04:19:46,800
You know what if I ever

1994
04:19:47,680 --> 04:19:55,200
If I would I would probably recreate that that drink that I really enjoy as like a gamer subs drink

1995
04:19:55,200 --> 04:19:57,200
But I don't know if like

1996
04:19:57,440 --> 04:20:02,880
It'll be good because I like it for its coconut or it's like boba boba tea

1997
04:20:04,080 --> 04:20:06,800
flavor for its milk tea flavor, you know

1998
04:20:09,520 --> 04:20:11,520
Mercy's snippets like snippets

1999
04:20:13,680 --> 04:20:20,560
I don't know. I don't know maybe I think it's it's harder to get drinks than it is to get a waifu cup

2000
04:20:21,520 --> 04:20:28,160
Okay, during the sunrise the site of the sun hitting Mount Zennum is nothing short of spectacular

2001
04:20:28,560 --> 04:20:33,680
If you happen to stay here overnight, please do yourself a favorite and wake up early to catch the view of the mountain

2002
04:20:37,920 --> 04:20:41,040
Welcome feel free to examine anything that might interest you

2003
04:20:41,840 --> 04:20:43,840
Paws a pinwheel

2004
04:20:43,840 --> 04:20:44,960
What does it do?

2005
04:20:44,960 --> 04:20:48,240
Cures, ping, peppy corn

2006
04:20:48,960 --> 04:20:50,960
Peppie corn

2007
04:20:51,280 --> 04:20:54,000
My hammer, holy shit. These are expensive

2008
04:20:56,640 --> 04:20:58,640
Another migrant seal, huh?

2009
04:21:01,360 --> 04:21:03,360
Have a safe journey

2010
04:21:06,480 --> 04:21:11,520
I want to go here let me in no it's not letting me in

2011
04:21:18,800 --> 04:21:20,800
Wow

2012
04:21:21,200 --> 04:21:23,680
What brings you here today? Oh, would you like to do?

2013
04:21:24,880 --> 04:21:31,520
Oh, you're you're the magic person here. I haven't gotten another crest graph in a long time. What the hell?

2014
04:21:34,560 --> 04:21:36,560
Please come back anytime

2015
04:21:40,640 --> 04:21:42,640
Over there is the order of wind

2016
04:21:43,600 --> 04:21:46,160
The legend has it that Zephyr's

2017
04:21:46,880 --> 04:21:51,360
Zephyr's chosen one shall stand on the altar and awaken the western wind of hope

2018
04:21:56,080 --> 04:21:58,080
Gary and the same lady you're the same lady

2019
04:22:03,600 --> 04:22:06,800
Did we miss the graph I'll have to go back to that area then

2020
04:22:07,360 --> 04:22:09,360
Oh

2021
04:22:11,200 --> 04:22:13,200
Woo-gah

2022
04:22:14,160 --> 04:22:17,520
I don't read the sky reaching demon tower. Yeah, I want to read it

2023
04:22:18,400 --> 04:22:22,160
Having no wings did not stop the aloo from reaching the sky

2024
04:22:22,960 --> 04:22:28,800
The aloo's extraordinary alchemy skills enabled them to build a sky reaching tower

2025
04:22:29,680 --> 04:22:33,280
The teleportation device was installed on top of the tower

2026
04:22:34,000 --> 04:22:36,960
It was said to be a ladder to the sea of stars

2027
04:22:38,400 --> 04:22:44,960
At the end of the great war all aloo and humans were exhausted many projects like the massive tower

2028
04:22:47,440 --> 04:22:51,840
The tower fell into disrepair and the entrance was sealed by the guardians

2029
04:22:52,720 --> 04:22:57,440
But we'll never know the reason why the aloo built this tower to the stars

2030
04:22:58,160 --> 04:23:03,520
Wanderers of a strange land you need rest your

2031
04:23:04,320 --> 04:23:06,640
Wings from a long journey feel free to stay with us

2032
04:23:07,360 --> 04:23:11,520
Allow me to guide you to the sleeping area and your restful night be blessed by the guardian

2033
04:23:12,080 --> 04:23:14,640
Oh, we get it for free. Please don't take my money

2034
04:23:21,840 --> 04:23:23,840
You're not gonna get me

2035
04:23:28,400 --> 04:23:30,400
I

2036
04:23:39,040 --> 04:23:41,040
Am

2037
04:23:43,120 --> 04:23:48,560
I am the chief of this village. I've been around for so long. I have forgotten my name

2038
04:23:49,520 --> 04:23:54,160
Call me whatever you'd you like Rudy jack and shrine maiden Cecilia

2039
04:23:55,120 --> 04:23:57,760
How do you know all of our names

2040
04:23:59,600 --> 04:24:04,320
How would I not had a dream about you visiting us here in basker village

2041
04:24:05,920 --> 04:24:07,600
I also dreamt

2042
04:24:07,600 --> 04:24:09,600
about the guardians and the demons

2043
04:24:10,800 --> 04:24:17,600
Of course, so is nothing more than a dream, but I believe a dream is one that makes is what one makes of it

2044
04:24:18,480 --> 04:24:21,120
This dream was just too vivid to ignore

2045
04:24:21,840 --> 04:24:25,280
Guardians warriors, you must listen carefully

2046
04:24:26,080 --> 04:24:33,120
Deep in the mountains in Mount Zenim lies a keystone a mother who the monster seek is sealed within it

2047
04:24:34,720 --> 04:24:39,120
Destroying the seals that contain her would be their priority

2048
04:24:40,080 --> 04:24:43,280
Should the demons wish to awaken the mother

2049
04:24:43,440 --> 04:24:45,440
The mother

2050
04:24:46,560 --> 04:24:52,240
Shrine maiden and her warriors Mount Zenim is located to the northeast of our village

2051
04:24:53,680 --> 04:24:57,760
I firmly believe you are the ones who can summon the Zephyr

2052
04:24:58,800 --> 04:25:02,080
Zephyr grant us the western wind of hope

2053
04:25:03,840 --> 04:25:07,680
Visit the keeper of the altar of wind who will be of great help to you

2054
04:25:14,240 --> 04:25:16,240
I

2055
04:25:22,000 --> 04:25:26,800
Hope I can dodge copyright. I just don't want to share I don't want to share my hard work

2056
04:25:28,320 --> 04:25:31,840
You will live and die on Fogaya. You're the children of our mother planet

2057
04:25:36,800 --> 04:25:38,800
Upsies

2058
04:25:43,680 --> 04:25:45,680
And Zephyr or Zephyr

2059
04:26:06,640 --> 04:26:08,640
I say like Zephyr, uh-huh

2060
04:26:09,200 --> 04:26:16,160
Oh, is this a guy who does the thing there are fragmented gems that hold the power of the elements like earth, wind, fire, and water

2061
04:26:16,800 --> 04:26:22,400
Find these amid the ruins bits of their power of the guardians that leaked from the ley line and crystallized

2062
04:26:24,480 --> 04:26:26,480
Well, I have some

2063
04:26:30,240 --> 04:26:33,920
Oops didn't mean to uh, to totally, you know

2064
04:26:34,400 --> 04:26:36,400
Just draw your house

2065
04:26:43,520 --> 04:26:45,520
Thanks for the stuff

2066
04:27:03,920 --> 04:27:05,920
They found something

2067
04:27:12,400 --> 04:27:14,400
Here

2068
04:27:17,920 --> 04:27:19,920
Tengela

2069
04:27:28,080 --> 04:27:30,080
Oh my gosh

2070
04:27:34,320 --> 04:27:36,320
Ah

2071
04:27:40,480 --> 04:27:43,360
Oops I hope these resets

2072
04:28:04,240 --> 04:28:08,740
Oh another house

2073
04:28:26,800 --> 04:28:29,680
Can I walk in that house with with my thing

2074
04:28:30,640 --> 04:28:34,640
Oh, yeah, maybe I can use handpan

2075
04:28:44,320 --> 04:28:46,320
Give me your stuff

2076
04:28:51,360 --> 04:28:53,360
Give me your stuff

2077
04:28:55,680 --> 04:28:57,680
I will set your barn on fire

2078
04:28:59,840 --> 04:29:01,840
Yeah

2079
04:29:03,360 --> 04:29:06,880
Can I get to that small little crate over there?

2080
04:29:24,080 --> 04:29:26,800
Do we just talk to the chicken then

2081
04:29:29,680 --> 04:29:31,680
So

2082
04:29:42,480 --> 04:29:44,480
Goodbye chickens

2083
04:29:52,720 --> 04:29:54,720
Maybe vomit

2084
04:29:59,680 --> 04:30:01,680
Goodbye chickens

2085
04:30:04,000 --> 04:30:06,000
Maybe

2086
04:30:12,000 --> 04:30:17,600
Who books feet of the Baskers, let's go

2087
04:30:21,440 --> 04:30:26,480
The Quran region and Baskers both worship the same guardians

2088
04:30:26,480 --> 04:30:31,680
Baskers both worship the same guardians. However, the abbey believes in living with nature

2089
04:30:32,560 --> 04:30:35,840
Baskers believe believe in living in nature

2090
04:30:36,640 --> 04:30:42,240
Centro to this belief is the concept of regression the return to an existence within nature

2091
04:30:43,360 --> 04:30:48,400
A natural way of life where human lived as part of the ecosystem rather than a part

2092
04:30:49,040 --> 04:30:51,760
It was believed in practice amongst the Basker

2093
04:30:52,720 --> 04:30:58,320
The science of the environment is unknown to have been taught by the elu long ago

2094
04:30:59,200 --> 04:31:02,400
Possibly directly related to the ancient Basker

2095
04:31:03,600 --> 04:31:07,840
Elu were known for their intimate knowledge of the laws of nature

2096
04:31:08,480 --> 04:31:10,480
They understood the magic of elements

2097
04:31:11,280 --> 04:31:14,960
The elu incorporated this knowledge to create their stunning technology

2098
04:31:15,520 --> 04:31:17,680
While the Baskers applied it to their way of life

2099
04:31:21,920 --> 04:31:23,920
Wait

2100
04:31:26,960 --> 04:31:33,040
I'm just gonna accept I'm not gonna get it it it mocks me

2101
04:31:37,520 --> 04:31:41,520
It mocks me unless there's something in there that I can throw at it

2102
04:31:46,080 --> 04:31:48,080
Like a jug or a jar

2103
04:31:49,360 --> 04:31:51,360
Nah

2104
04:31:52,720 --> 04:31:54,720
Yeah

2105
04:32:07,440 --> 04:32:09,440
I want it

2106
04:32:22,400 --> 04:32:24,400
Fuck

2107
04:32:41,840 --> 04:32:43,840
This is this is

2108
04:32:45,680 --> 04:32:47,680
My destiny

2109
04:32:48,560 --> 04:32:51,360
I can't go out there it doesn't exist

2110
04:32:57,040 --> 04:32:59,040
It doesn't exist

2111
04:33:06,880 --> 04:33:08,880
I can't go out there

2112
04:33:09,360 --> 04:33:11,360
Oh

2113
04:33:15,520 --> 04:33:23,280
This is heck oh or can I oh no, no, I can't

2114
04:33:27,600 --> 04:33:29,600
No, no, I can't

2115
04:33:34,640 --> 04:33:36,640
Oh well

2116
04:33:37,040 --> 04:33:39,040
That's

2117
04:33:39,680 --> 04:33:41,680
My berry

2118
04:33:42,960 --> 04:33:44,960
My berry with the heck

2119
04:33:44,960 --> 04:33:46,960
Fuck

2120
04:34:04,240 --> 04:34:07,440
Please let me have it again this time I won't throw it over there

2121
04:34:14,960 --> 04:34:16,960
Yeah

2122
04:34:23,920 --> 04:34:28,000
That was embarrassing I got too excited

2123
04:34:30,800 --> 04:34:40,000
I got too excited and I was like oh look at that how handy I'm gonna throw it at the area

2124
04:34:45,760 --> 04:34:47,760
Oh

2125
04:34:52,000 --> 04:34:54,000
I'm not but a fool

2126
04:34:56,480 --> 04:35:00,160
Can I ever go on these ladders maybe I can hold on

2127
04:35:00,400 --> 04:35:02,400
I

2128
04:35:10,560 --> 04:35:13,440
Our chief can see the future in his dreams

2129
04:35:14,160 --> 04:35:17,200
That does not mean he can foresee everything about the future

2130
04:35:17,680 --> 04:35:20,960
There's no absolute future since a strong will can change one's fate

2131
04:35:26,400 --> 04:35:28,800
I'm sorry, but I need to bomb this

2132
04:35:30,160 --> 04:35:32,160
I

2133
04:35:49,120 --> 04:35:55,280
What if I like trying to send excuse me trying to send here. Yeah, it works

2134
04:36:00,400 --> 04:36:02,400
You

2135
04:36:06,560 --> 04:36:11,280
You know the original you could bomb the chickens in the first village and then some would turn into items really

2136
04:36:15,840 --> 04:36:17,840
Wait, let me talk let me talk let me talk

2137
04:36:18,560 --> 04:36:22,560
Generation after generation believed in the revival of the guardians in this frontier

2138
04:36:23,200 --> 04:36:25,200
Our chief dreamt of the western wind

2139
04:36:25,600 --> 04:36:30,080
I sense a change on the horizon feel the anticipation building up in this village

2140
04:36:36,720 --> 04:36:38,720
Yes, stop give me it

2141
04:36:41,280 --> 04:36:43,280
Yeah

2142
04:36:43,840 --> 04:36:48,880
You have a bookshelf you got any cool books and shelves

2143
04:36:51,440 --> 04:36:54,240
No, no thanks anyways

2144
04:36:55,200 --> 04:36:57,200
You

2145
04:37:06,800 --> 04:37:08,800
Got it

2146
04:37:09,040 --> 04:37:11,040
You

2147
04:37:23,200 --> 04:37:26,640
We got it I gotta I gotta loot this entire place first, you know

2148
04:37:30,800 --> 04:37:32,800
I seriously don't know how to get there

2149
04:37:38,800 --> 04:37:40,800
I

2150
04:37:44,800 --> 04:37:47,200
It's a little havoc as a treat

2151
04:37:53,920 --> 04:37:55,920
Man

2152
04:37:57,840 --> 04:38:04,160
Maybe we'll get into all that will help later. Yeah, I tried handpan already didn't work

2153
04:38:09,760 --> 04:38:18,320
Okay, let's go here you're right

2154
04:38:21,840 --> 04:38:28,240
Everyone steps into the altar and looks to up to the sky a sandy wind blows nothing happens

2155
04:38:31,120 --> 04:38:35,840
I'm afraid Zephyr the western wind of your hope is not ready to respond to your call

2156
04:38:36,800 --> 04:38:40,880
Perhaps the power lost by the guardians is making this progress more difficult

2157
04:38:41,520 --> 04:38:44,640
Understand that there are many abandoned guardian temples throughout Fogaya

2158
04:38:45,680 --> 04:38:52,320
There are ruins that honor time known as the perpetual engine located northeast of our village

2159
04:38:53,120 --> 04:38:57,120
These warrior and shrine maiden I ask you to gather up all of the guardians power

2160
04:38:58,640 --> 04:39:01,360
Only then will the Zephyr respond to your call

2161
04:39:02,480 --> 04:39:04,480
Render the wind of hope

2162
04:39:05,840 --> 04:39:07,840
We

2163
04:39:11,520 --> 04:39:13,520
Well

2164
04:39:14,880 --> 04:39:16,880
We're off the sea

2165
04:39:18,320 --> 04:39:20,320
We're off the sea people

2166
04:39:24,880 --> 04:39:28,960
On another side mission, but I think

2167
04:39:29,600 --> 04:39:37,120
Should we do another temple senpai or should we save that for another day?

2168
04:39:40,320 --> 04:39:44,320
I can probably push myself to do another temple probably

2169
04:39:49,840 --> 04:39:54,240
How you feeling my eyes are a little dry and I have to wake up early tomorrow

2170
04:39:59,200 --> 04:40:03,120
Well, at least we have this little map in the corner now

2171
04:40:05,040 --> 04:40:07,040
That's not as brutal and evil

2172
04:40:10,640 --> 04:40:18,480
More goat y'all got no, um gonna just go swimming it's gonna go swimming at a lake

2173
04:40:23,920 --> 04:40:28,080
Yeah, well, I think I'm gonna arrest it for today

2174
04:40:28,960 --> 04:40:30,960
Oh

2175
04:40:37,760 --> 04:40:45,440
Yeah, let's rest for today. That was a good run. I think senpai we did so much

2176
04:40:49,040 --> 04:40:51,040
Yeah, we did so much

2177
04:40:51,760 --> 04:40:53,760
Oh

2178
04:41:03,360 --> 04:41:11,280
Almost dropped my stuff I have too much controllers on my desk like a controller for every game system

2179
04:41:14,240 --> 04:41:19,360
Okay, well senpai you made a lot of progress tonight

2180
04:41:21,440 --> 04:41:24,960
I put my hat away

2181
04:41:35,120 --> 04:41:38,160
Oh, but tomorrow is supposed to be really really hot

2182
04:41:38,800 --> 04:41:45,680
So that's why we're gonna go out to the lake stick our little feet sees into the water. Maybe sitting it

2183
04:41:46,000 --> 04:42:01,600
It's supposed to be really hot. So I'm hoping that it will cool off because it's just that hot, you know

2184
04:42:11,440 --> 04:42:13,440
Let me find

2185
04:42:15,760 --> 04:42:17,760
I

2186
04:42:18,320 --> 04:42:20,320
Schedule

2187
04:42:26,080 --> 04:42:28,080
Tomorrow

2188
04:42:32,240 --> 04:42:37,040
I am nothing it's my day off. Whoo. That's why I'm going to the lake just for a little bit

2189
04:42:37,040 --> 04:42:40,800
It's probably just gonna be like an hour and then I go back home and do more work

2190
04:42:43,120 --> 04:42:45,120
You know like always

2191
04:42:45,920 --> 04:42:47,920
You

2192
04:42:48,240 --> 04:42:50,240
And then

2193
04:42:51,760 --> 04:42:56,320
Thursday is killer seven, but I might change up killer seven

2194
04:42:57,360 --> 04:43:03,600
Because I kind of feel like maybe I'm not skilled enough to play killer seven

2195
04:43:03,680 --> 04:43:07,360
And I don't remember much of what I did for killer seven. You know what I mean?

2196
04:43:08,320 --> 04:43:10,320
You know what I mean right now. I'm just kind of like

2197
04:43:10,560 --> 04:43:12,560
Uh

2198
04:43:14,080 --> 04:43:16,080
I don't know

2199
04:43:19,840 --> 04:43:25,120
I'm simply not skilled enough. I'm simply just bad at games

2200
04:43:32,400 --> 04:43:34,400
But who knows uh

2201
04:43:34,640 --> 04:43:36,160
If it's

2202
04:43:36,160 --> 04:43:41,200
Not going to be killer seven. I might replace it with like a visual novel or something

2203
04:43:42,400 --> 04:43:44,400
Because I can

2204
04:44:00,560 --> 04:44:02,560
And then

2205
04:44:03,360 --> 04:44:08,720
Yeah, maybe a visual novel or something, but it depends on how I feel if I feel like

2206
04:44:09,280 --> 04:44:11,280
Yeah, I can totally do killer seven

2207
04:44:12,080 --> 04:44:13,760
I'll do killer seven

2208
04:44:13,760 --> 04:44:15,120
But sounds like

2209
04:44:15,120 --> 04:44:20,880
But I'm I'm getting the feeling that I'm gonna be like I am not skilled enough to do the shooty shoot

2210
04:44:20,960 --> 04:44:24,080
And the shooty shoot might be too much for my my we

2211
04:44:24,960 --> 04:44:26,960
My lack of uh

2212
04:44:28,080 --> 04:44:30,720
Uh, what do you call it? Reflexus

2213
04:44:32,880 --> 04:44:36,880
My reflexes are uh weak and could use a lot of work

2214
04:44:47,920 --> 04:44:53,200
So for a backup I was thinking I would play

2215
04:44:56,880 --> 04:44:58,720
I would play like

2216
04:44:58,720 --> 04:45:03,280
Maybe a pointing click or maybe like something super relaxing like a visual novel

2217
04:45:04,720 --> 04:45:06,880
When you look up like if I if I

2218
04:45:08,160 --> 04:45:12,160
What's the word sort things out visual novel?

2219
04:45:18,240 --> 04:45:22,800
You peel is too hard and I am very weak

2220
04:45:29,440 --> 04:45:31,840
Let's see I have

2221
04:45:34,560 --> 04:45:39,840
Like that like that. Oh, yeah, I have like all of the muvelove wait is muvelove

2222
04:45:40,720 --> 04:45:42,720
Yeah, muvelove might not be safe

2223
04:45:49,920 --> 04:45:55,920
But I can probably choose something else. Hi. Thank you so much for the super chat

2224
04:45:56,800 --> 04:46:02,000
Thank you for the nz nz was nz new zealand

2225

Thank me please

2227
04:46:26,560 --> 04:46:28,560
Oh

2229
04:46:43,680 --> 04:46:45,680
There there you go

2230
04:46:56,160 --> 04:46:58,160
Ha ha ha

2231
04:47:17,120 --> 04:47:19,120
Yeah, I have no idea

2232
04:47:19,920 --> 04:47:23,760
Honestly, I don't know what I'll play but I'll figure it out

2233
04:47:24,400 --> 04:47:28,640
Probably hopefully fingers crossed

2234
04:47:36,720 --> 04:47:38,720
Thank you

2235
04:47:47,520 --> 04:47:52,880
I forgot I didn't turn off the senpai alerts for this one

2236
04:47:54,480 --> 04:47:56,480
Senpai

2237
04:47:58,720 --> 04:48:00,720
Thank you

2238

Ha ha after that is a be a lord event

2242
04:48:33,280 --> 04:48:39,440
It is six hours of continuous

2243
04:48:41,760 --> 04:48:43,760
ASMR

2244
04:48:44,320 --> 04:48:46,320
From start of the day

2245
04:48:47,040 --> 04:48:50,560
To the end of the day starting with icy I believe

And old triggers. I'm gonna be testing them out on you. Hopefully they're not too harsh

2251
04:49:20,880 --> 04:49:22,880

2280
04:51:41,840 --> 04:51:46,960
Well, it will be the job of senpais to keep each other accountable

2281
04:51:48,160 --> 04:51:52,900
Start whacking and when there are string eyes or any runners

2282
04:52:01,360 --> 04:52:03,360

And it'll be lots of fun

2285
04:52:33,360 --> 04:52:40,000
And then we're back to fun and then just doing my regular schedule as always

2286
04:52:43,360 --> 04:52:49,040
That's all for me other than the regular stuff

2287
04:52:52,880 --> 04:52:56,080
Other than the regular stuff is there any more questions

2288
04:52:57,040 --> 04:53:02,000
Or concerns or anything that you would like clarification from

2289
04:53:06,880 --> 04:53:08,880

I can let you all be free, of course so you can just

2298
04:54:16,640 --> 04:54:18,640
You know wander but as well

2299
04:54:19,280 --> 04:54:20,240
Uh

2300
04:54:20,240 --> 04:54:24,560
Watch for other senpais and maybe me who knows I'll be behind your back

2301
04:54:24,640 --> 04:54:26,640
If any wandering eyes or

2302
04:54:28,000 --> 04:54:33,200
If you start, you know having thoughts about not coming back or anything

2303
04:54:36,080 --> 04:54:40,000
That might be an issue right especially the not coming back stuff

2304
04:54:40,640 --> 04:54:42,160
If you don't come back

2305
04:54:42,160 --> 04:54:46,240
How can I show you my love and how can we have fun together and how can we spend eternity together?

2306
04:54:46,240 --> 04:54:52,080
That's not possible is it if you're we're gone, but if you want to be gone forever, I can have that arranged senpai

2307
04:54:53,040 --> 04:54:59,120
I can have that arranged for you to be gone forever. It just requires a little barrel a little acid and

2308
04:55:00,000 --> 04:55:02,000
You know a bone saw

2309
04:55:03,920 --> 04:55:09,920
But I can have you be gone forever if that's what you want if that's what you truly want

2310
04:55:15,920 --> 04:55:17,920
So don't worry

2311
04:55:18,880 --> 04:55:25,280
