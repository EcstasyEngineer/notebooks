WEBVTT

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Oh

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
Hey

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
Ah, good enough for those supplies

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Can you hear me okay? How's the volume?

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
I hope everything's okay

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm gonna pamper you

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
Turn up the volume then

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
Turn up the volume then

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
Today, I'm gonna pamper you

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Because you did such a good job

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
It's been a long day

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
And I felt like it's a nice day

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
So, don't you want to kiss me again?

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Shhh, I'm scared

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
Okay

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
How about I whisper a little loud?

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Is that better?

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Okay

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Okay

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
How about I whisper a little louder?

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Is that better?

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Is that better?

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Okay

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
It's much better, okay

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm so sorry

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Today, I'm going to pamper my supplies

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
I went out and got so many things for my supplies

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
I hope you like them

07:26.000 --> 07:40.000
Can you hear this?

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Can you hear this?

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
These are the papples that you guys were talking about

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
These are the papples I cried

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
The crack pipes, they're not really crack pipes

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
They're ice rollers

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
They're ice rollers

08:21.000 --> 08:33.000
They're ice rollers

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
It's not blood

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Oh my goodness

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Can't give you a second if it's still too quiet

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't know how I can whisper even louder

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Okay, hold on

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
I got this, okay, audio keeps cutting out

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Okay, give me a second

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm so sorry, I'm so new to this

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Okay

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Is this better?

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
I turned it off

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
I turned it off

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
I turned it off

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
I turned it off

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
Now, now, everything, can you hear everything?

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Okay, so bye

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
I'm going to use the ice rollers on you and massage your face

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
I hope it feels good

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
Can you feel it on your eyes?

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
These ice rollers are great for public eyes

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Your eyes, yes, sometimes it's really this small

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
And so, if you put these in the fridge, it has to pop in

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
And if you want more of it, good

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
It just relaxes with the supply

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
It covers

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm just going to treat you

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Okay

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
I'm going

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Okay

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
These ones might make a little bit of a different sound

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
Because the bubbles, the head is actually shaped like moles

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
So the moons might make a little bit of a different sound

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
That would be a mistake

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Thank you for the rate, middle

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Middle

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
I'm glad you like it so far

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm glad you like it so far

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Edithal, welcome, welcome to the stream

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
Doing ASMR is my first time ever

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Trying ASMR

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Okay

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Left eye massage

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Right eye one

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Doing this on

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
I don't know which to use

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Anyway, I'm going to try the left eye massage

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
Left eye massage

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Head on

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
I have a one day ASMR special spot

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
And put this on my lap

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Bring it back up

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I want something simple

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
It's brand new, let's open it

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
Almost got it on your ear there

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
It's a box cutter, let's open this package now

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Let's open this package

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Let's open it

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Let's open it

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Let's open it

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
Shhh, and toss this in trash now

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
I bought you a gel

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
A gel mask for you to wear

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
The back is nice and plush

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
A lot of gel balls are rolling around

15:46.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm going to angle this because you're laying on my lap so far

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
I'm not going to lie, this feels really good to squish as well

16:24.000 --> 16:36.000
Alright, let's put this around except my

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Oh dear, I need some scissors

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
Let's cut the tag off

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
There we go

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Sorry that made a big sound

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
Alright

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
No eye patch today

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
Today the eye patch stays on so I can look at your eyes and look into my eyes

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Okay, I'm putting it on now so far

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Let me adjust it for you

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
Does it feel comfortable Senpai?

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
Do you feel like it's relaxing your eyes?

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
I'll massage on top of it

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Okay

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
You must be so tired

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Okay

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Can I scratch your face?

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
It's like Senpai

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
It's like Senpai

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Good

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Good, I'm so glad you're so glad

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I love you Senpai

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
There we go

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
One kiss, we don't want to get in trouble

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
Let's have a ear massage

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
I had a ear massage once, it was really nice

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
I'm just gonna copy them, I hope

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
I hope that Senpai feels good too

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
A little ear massages

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
I'm gonna go a little bit deeper

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Okay, I'm gonna go a little deeper

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
I'm trying to be as gentle as I can

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
I'm trying to be as gentle as I can

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Okay

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Nice and relaxed

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
I love you Senpai

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
Let's massage the top of your ear and your ear

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Okay

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Wow, hey, yeah, it did so well this week Senpai

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
It did so well this week

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
I'm so proud

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm so proud

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
We're doing so well, we're doing so well

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
And

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Oh, Senpai

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Okay, you got hair on your face

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Okay, don't worry, I got it

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
Doesn't hurt each other

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Piyoto intimate

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
If you also love it, it doesn't hurt to shine

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Okay

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
You want me to call a good girl?

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Okay

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Good girl

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
You've been so very good

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
The week, we're halfway through the week

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
So you can relax

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
You can relax and have a lot of fun on the weekend

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
You've been so good

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Good girl

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Hold on Senpai, let me take this mask off

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Good boy

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
You did so good this week

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
You're halfway through the week

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
And you have such a fun weekend

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
I'm sorry I was quiet before

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
It's just that

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
I don't know how close I can get to you Senpai

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm a little shy

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
So getting too close

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
Makes me a little nervous

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
This is close enough

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Does it feel good?

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Scream into your ear, no thank you

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Some of my Senpais

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Might not like that

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Senpai

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Are you feeling relaxed now?

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Okay

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I'm so glad that

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
Let's bring these back

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Let's bring these back

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
These

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
They were sitting in my lap

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
So they're a little warm

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Just like you

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
These waterfalls are a little bit different

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
They're shaped like moons

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
So they kind of remind me of Sailor Moon Wands

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Presum, power

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Makeup

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
If you scratch my forehead

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
Kill this one

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Okay

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Kill this one

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Okay

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Kill this one

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Okay

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
Is that better?

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
Is that better?

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
No, it's not a magical girl, R.P.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
I just think they look like Sailor Moon Wands

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
I know what you're really like

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
In the name of the moon

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
I'll punish you

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Okay

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
I'm sorry, I'm trying to

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
To suppress my laugh

31:09.000 --> 31:29.800
Oh no, I don't want to be loud, I know some of you, I know some of you are trying to

31:30.800 --> 31:31.800
huh?

31:40.800 --> 31:44.800
These actually really sound nice, these sound so nice, right?

31:44.800 --> 32:06.800
Signers, he found it in stores, I thought of him for a few seconds

32:15.800 --> 32:16.800
huh?

32:24.800 --> 32:26.800
Do you want the scissors back?

32:29.800 --> 32:31.800
What kind of scissors?

32:31.800 --> 32:42.800
This, it's a gel mask, it's a gel mask with little gel balls in it, it's got a plush back

32:44.800 --> 32:45.800
ok

33:10.800 --> 33:13.800
oops, almost cut your ear off

33:14.800 --> 33:15.800
ok

33:45.800 --> 33:47.800
hahaha

33:56.800 --> 33:58.800
what about right in front of me?

34:14.800 --> 34:40.800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I got a little excited

34:40.800 --> 34:46.800
I got a little excited, I'm sorry

35:00.800 --> 35:01.800
I'm sorry

35:05.800 --> 35:06.800
I'm sorry

35:11.800 --> 35:12.800
here

35:12.800 --> 35:14.800
that's it

35:14.800 --> 35:15.800
here

35:39.800 --> 35:41.800
here, let's put it back

35:45.800 --> 35:49.800
that's not bad

35:53.800 --> 35:55.800
wow, I can wipe it off

36:10.800 --> 36:11.800
there you go

36:11.800 --> 36:13.800
there you go

36:20.800 --> 36:23.800
I'm going to tap on your highlight

36:35.800 --> 36:39.800
sorry, I don't have any bandages on me right now

36:42.800 --> 36:43.800
sorry

36:47.800 --> 36:49.800
you always look perfect so far

36:51.800 --> 36:52.800
always

36:54.800 --> 36:56.800
kiss me

36:56.800 --> 36:57.800
ok

37:11.800 --> 37:22.800
your ears are just fine, your ears are just fine

37:26.800 --> 37:28.800
your face is still beautiful

37:31.800 --> 37:34.800
you are doing great

37:42.800 --> 37:46.800
sorry, I got a little rough

37:47.800 --> 37:51.800
I guess some instincts took over

37:52.800 --> 37:57.800
it's not just anything you did, it's me

38:02.800 --> 38:07.800
I don't think it's going to work, I don't want you to do that

38:12.800 --> 38:13.800
ok

38:17.800 --> 38:20.800
here, take some ear massages

38:42.800 --> 38:45.800
I don't think it will work

39:02.800 --> 39:05.800
I love you so much

39:12.800 --> 39:15.800
I love you so much so much

39:16.800 --> 39:18.800
you did so well

39:20.800 --> 39:21.800
I'm sorry

39:22.800 --> 39:23.800
I hate you

39:25.800 --> 39:26.800
not this time

39:41.800 --> 39:42.800
I love you

40:11.800 --> 40:13.800
I love you

40:41.800 --> 40:42.800
I love you

40:56.800 --> 40:57.800

41:00.800 --> 41:01.800

41:05.800 --> 41:07.800

41:11.800 --> 41:14.800

41:42.800 --> 41:43.800

41:55.800 --> 41:56.800

42:22.800 --> 42:23.800

42:24.800 --> 42:25.800
meow meow

42:29.800 --> 42:30.800

42:38.800 --> 42:39.800

42:41.800 --> 42:42.800
now

42:47.800 --> 42:48.800
now

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
now

42:51.800 --> 42:52.800
now

43:02.800 --> 43:05.800
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

43:12.800 --> 43:13.800

43:15.800 --> 43:16.800
wait

43:23.800 --> 43:26.800
ok, now try just reuse it by

43:29.800 --> 43:31.800
toasted coconuts

43:33.800 --> 43:35.800
toasted coconuts

43:35.800 --> 43:48.800
Cabbage, cabbages, cabbages, like this is, like this is, like this is.

44:05.800 --> 44:18.800
6, 6, card.

44:18.800 --> 44:27.800
Stop it, stop it, bye.

44:35.800 --> 44:48.800
Where is my super scent?

44:48.800 --> 45:13.800
I said why is my super scent?

45:13.800 --> 45:38.800
Papi, Papi.

45:38.800 --> 46:03.800
Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound?

46:03.800 --> 46:17.800
Ten amour, ten amour.

46:17.800 --> 46:46.800
Give yourself a good example, you're so pretty.

46:46.800 --> 47:15.800
Give yourself a good example.

47:15.800 --> 47:39.800
Give yourself a good example.

47:39.800 --> 48:08.800
Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound? Do you want to hear the sound?

48:08.800 --> 48:28.800
Can I make that blue song?

48:28.800 --> 48:56.800
Do you want to hear the sound?

48:56.800 --> 49:25.800
Do you like it past, like this?

49:25.800 --> 49:43.800
Okay, I can keep doing this, right?

49:43.800 --> 50:08.800
As long as you're feeling relaxed and fine, that's all that matters. Water, give me a moment, I'll be extra gentle with you.

50:08.800 --> 50:35.800
Water, give me a moment.

50:35.800 --> 51:02.800
Water, give me a moment, I'll be extra gentle with you.

51:02.800 --> 51:31.800
Water, give me a moment.

51:32.800 --> 51:56.800
Water, give me a moment, I'll be extra gentle with you.

52:02.800 --> 52:27.800
Water, give me a moment.

52:27.800 --> 52:40.800
Water, give me a moment.

52:40.800 --> 53:05.800
Water, give me a moment.

53:05.800 --> 53:29.800
Water, give me a moment.

53:29.800 --> 53:58.800
Water, give me a moment.

53:58.800 --> 54:14.800
Water, give me a moment.

54:14.800 --> 54:34.800
Water, give me a moment.

54:34.800 --> 55:01.800
Water, give me a moment.

55:01.800 --> 55:22.800
Water, give me a moment.

55:22.800 --> 55:48.800
Water, give me a moment.

55:48.800 --> 56:03.800
Water, give me a moment.

56:03.800 --> 56:30.800
Water, give me a moment.

56:30.800 --> 56:57.800
Water, give me a moment.

56:57.800 --> 57:17.800
Water, give me a moment.

57:17.800 --> 57:46.800
Water, give me a moment.

57:47.800 --> 58:13.800
Water, give me a moment.

58:13.800 --> 58:42.800
Water, give me a moment.

58:43.800 --> 59:02.800
Water, give me a moment.

59:02.800 --> 59:22.800
Water, give me a moment.

59:22.800 --> 59:42.800
Water, give me a moment.

59:42.800 --> 01:00:09.800
Water, give me a moment.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:29.800
Water, give me a moment.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:49.800
Water, give me a moment.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:01:09.800
Water, give me a moment.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:29.800
Water, give me a moment.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:46.800
I'm trying to be as tame as possible so that my supplies go to sleep and wake up, maybe able to see my sleep.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:54.800
I'm tapping on you.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:14.800
I hope that's correct or not.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:33.800
I'm a little stuffed up so it will sound disgusting if I...it will sound disgusting.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:51.800
My favorite deep end, um, when that's on sale.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:57.800
Can I burp the outfit? No, I can't burp a little on command. I can't burp on command.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:18.800
The image turned out to be my little poncho.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:28.800
My good little pets.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.800
My good little pets.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:42.800
YouTube doesn't punish me. I wonder if YouTube, I wonder if YouTube is different in each region, depending on their DOS.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:52.800
Because I know a lot of JPAs are a little bit more on the sexy side, but they don't get attacked.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:29.800
I can't stream before using a VPN because it's faster. It's not fast. It will let you go crazy.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:44.800
OBS doesn't recognize different regions and will not let you stream if you use a VPN. It's very hard to deal with.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:50.800
So, I have to abide by the rules.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:59.800
Okay. You can be good, right, Senpai, and follow the rules with me.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:05.800
Right, you can follow the rules, right? My heartbeat.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:18.800
I'm not going to lie, Senpai. You're kind of heavy, so I can't put you on my chest.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:46.800
Sorry, Senpai.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:56.800
Well, please, you. The microphone is kind of heavy, didn't it?

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.800
The 3DL, the stand I put it on, a little bit.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.800
Better.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.800
Okay.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:43.800
When I get a new stand to Senpai, I'll put you on my chest and then give you my heartbeat. Okay?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:07:00.800
Are smaller than you can hear my heartbeat. Right now, it's a little heavy.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:08.800
If I lift this up, I can lift it up a little bit, but it's quite heavy.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:19.800
I can probably use this to break your head in, Senpai. It can probably smash a few skulls in.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:28.800
I'll try my best, Senpai, but I can't make any problems.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:39.800
Okay, it takes a little while for you to smell.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:51.800
I don't have it on me, so I might take a while.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:08:10.800
I don't want to spook you with my keyboard, and...

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:21.800
Yeah, I don't want to spook you with my keyboard, and my keyboard and mouse, they're kind of loud.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.800
Oh, yeah.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:31.800
Senpai, here's that one.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.800
Okay.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.800
Although I might become numb.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.800
Bad boy, bad girl.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:18.800
I'll tell you why I won't fall asleep on stream.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:32.800
It's a funny story. Actually, maybe not now, it's not the time for it. It's a little too silly.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:41.800
It's a little too silly, and I think, uh, it will definitely ruin the mood.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.800
I almost said that thing, I'm sorry.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.800
No, no, I don't want to yab too much.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:10:03.800
I just want to explain the situation with ASMR, and why some of the laws are being taken down.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:15.800
Otherwise, you might have a bite in trouble here.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:32.800
Darling, darling, you're my good girl, you're mine.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:45.800
You're my good boy, you're mine.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:11.800
I can lie by Senpai's hips on her legs.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:24.800
Senpai, stay here with me Senpai. You like staying here with me, right?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:44.800
I'm so happy that you're here.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:56.800
I've waited so long for something so nice to be with.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:07.800
If you stay here, I'll try to make you as happy as I can. Okay?

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.800
Of course.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:17.800
So, I'm trying my best.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.800
I'm trying my, I'm trying my best.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:31.800
Even if this is my first time ASMR, and all my Senpais are good,

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.800
I've never used triggers before.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:43.800
Frankly, I didn't know what a trigger was, but now I'm letting so much free use of fun.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:13:08.800
I'm not sure if this is the correct way of doing it.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:22.800
Trigger, trigger.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.800
Yes, she explained what a countdown was.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.800
You won't get it though, Senpai.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.800
Naughty.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.800
Naughty, naughty Senpai.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800
Get it?

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.800
Give me the strength.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.800
Not this time.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.800
I'm not going to fall for this.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:55.800
You think I'm stupid Senpai?

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:23.800
I can't say that I won't fall for this. Sometimes I might be absent-minded.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.800
Then you got me Senpai.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.800
You tricked me.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:39.800
But not today.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:15:05.800
Especially with not the nice big brother YouTube watching.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:13.800
You can set a timer by yourself Senpai.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:23.800
Couple.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:29.800
Now what?

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800
Now what?

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.800
I cupped one ear.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:39.800
I cupped one ear now what?

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:50.800
Like this.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.800
Now what?

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800
No, seriously.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:16:05.800
No, I just go out on this.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.800
Oh really?

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.800
Is it like this?

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:28.800
No.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:44.800
Okay.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.800
Wow.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.800
I'm a little scared.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:57.800
But I got it.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:06.800
Like this.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.800
I'm going to put more pressure on you.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.800
Let's move this out of the way.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:18:00.800
Okay.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:25.800
I'm going to put pressure on you.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.800
Maybe you can turn to the other side.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.800
Okay.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:40.800
Sorry.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:19:06.800
I'm sorry.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:12.800
It was my elbow.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:22.800
I'm going to put pressure on you.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:32.800
Okay.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:20:00.800
I'm going to put pressure on you.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:24.800
Okay.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.800
Deep breaths.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:55.800
Deep breaths.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:10.800
Deep breaths.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:30.800
Deep breaths.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:58.800
Deep breaths.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:13.800
Deep breaths.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:24.800
Deep breaths.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:34.800
I think that's too silly.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:53.800
I'm sorry.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.800
I got too silly.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.800
I got too silly.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800
I didn't know what you meant.

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:23.800
I'm sorry.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.800
Okay.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:42.800
Now we are going to get back into this.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:24:07.800
Okay.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:20.800
Okay.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:59.800
Okay.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:21.800
Okay.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:32.800
Okay.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:26:01.800
Okay.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:30.800
Okay.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:59.800
Okay.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:28.800
Okay.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:57.800
Okay.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:26.800
Okay.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:53.800
Okay.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:29:22.800
Okay.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:51.800
Okay.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:30:13.800
Okay.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:40.800
Okay.

01:30:40.800 --> 01:31:02.800
Okay.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:28.800
Okay.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:55.800
Okay.

01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:24.800
Okay.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:53.800
Okay.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:33:15.800
Okay.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:42.800
Okay.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:34:11.800
Okay.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:39.800
Okay.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:35:06.800
Okay.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:34.800
Okay.
