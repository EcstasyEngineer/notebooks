1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
That did it.

2
00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:04,400
Oh my God, Wahooo!

3
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Wahoo! It's a me, a Mercio!

4
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Kahaio! It's a Mercio!

5
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Let's play the Mario RPG! Wahoo!

6
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Hahahaha!

7
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Oops! Oops! Oops! Oops!

8
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Things are knocking over! Stop moving!

9
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Okay, okay, here we go.

10
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Mercio!

11
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
I'm gonna walking on my Italian, okay?

12
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Son of a bitch!

13
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Hahahaha!

14
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Hahahaha!

15
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
And mine!

16
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Thank you, Slice Saber, for remembering for one month.

17
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Sorry I left the cage in touch-grass.

18
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,400
That's fine. Are you happy after you touch-grass?

19
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Okay, and that's all that matters.

20
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Wahoo! Okay, let's go play!

21
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Let's go play, everyone!

22
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Ah, I'm sorry, I finally remember!

23
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,400
It's a lot! It's a lot!

24
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,400
I can go through a chimney, right? No?

25
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I totally forgot what we were supposed to do.

26
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I remember everyone got kidnapped.

27
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
I remember everyone got kidnapped.

28
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,400
And now we have to find them.

29
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Oh yeah, we have to recover the stolen star.

30
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Is there anything else I need to do in the village?

31
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Just double-checking.

32
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Good to see you again. Do you have a chance to accumulate many frog coins?

33
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Let's see ya.

34
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Oh, right. Shit! I need this. Yes.

35
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Ah, I don't have that many frog coins! I need that one too.

36
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Oh my goodness, I need to go get that one. Hold on.

37
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,400
We're gonna do a funky thing.

38
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,400
We're gonna do the worst, and...

39
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm gonna...

40
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Where was that place that had, like, the...

41
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
The waterfall? Is it this one? No.

42
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,400
This one? I wanna play it again.

43
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I can try to look again if I'm a trampoline. It only costs 30 coins.

44
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Simpa!

45
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Yes! Okay, we're doing it.

46
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Night hop on!

47
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Wahoo!

48
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Okay, we're gonna get at least two more coins.

49
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Okay.

50
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
This is the minus river course!

51
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Wanna crash cars in it? Yeah, I forgot. I forgot.

52
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Go start at the top of the falls. Use left to move right...

53
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Left or right and score coins.

54
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Press B to make a headway a little against the pool.

55
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Along the way, there are a few holes. As to what will happen, we'll just keep that a surprise.

56
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Off you go!

57
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I need my green coins.

58
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Green? Green? Green? Green green?

59
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Green?

60
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Want green? Green?

61
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Green? No green.

62
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Wahoo! Green! Green! Green!

63
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I want green.

64
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
And green coins.

65
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Wait, am I done?

66
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Oh, shit. I forgot about this part.

67
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Now for the bear jump event!

68
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Need some pointers? Yeah.

69
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Time to jump and grab coins along the way!

70
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Oh, shit. I hate this one.

71
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Jump on to the next bear before they collide!

72
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
There was no green.

73
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Miss it, new change course!

74
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Looks like you're hitting something on your way!

75
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Almost forgot to tell you, leap over the fish that pop up or you'll lose coins!

76
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Ah!

77
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Son of a bitch!

78
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Don't you dare!

79
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Don't you dare!

80
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Shut up, I'm a gamer!

81
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Son of a bitch! I knew you were coming from behind too!

82
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Ah!

83
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Seventeen coins, thank you.

84
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Wow, it really, I didn't have anything. I didn't have it.

85
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
I can't believe I didn't have it.

86
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Wait, get back here. That's it, we're gonna fight.

87
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Where am I supposed to go again?

88
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I totally forgot where I was supposed to go! Tee-hee!

89
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Oh my gosh!

90
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Thank you so much, Kisignal Delta!

91
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Delta, uh, 7-9.

92
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,400
For gifting 50, 50 memberships.

93
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Thank you!

94
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Oh, thank you!

95
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Thank you!

96
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Thank you!

97
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Oh, thank you!

98
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Thank you, Jamdrop196 for the 134 Sufa.

99
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Hi, Kohai, any interest in the Ace Attorney games?

100
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Yes, but I've already played them all.

101
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Recently.

102
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
So therefore,

103
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,400
I don't think I'll pick it up

104
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,400
unless maybe I'll play the Miles Edgeworth game.

105
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Since I haven't played that one.

106
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,400
That was only available for limited time.

107
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I don't think it was ever released here at all.

108
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,400
I can't remember was I supposed to go to Merrymore?

109
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,400
That feeling when you totally forgot exactly what you were supposed to do.

110
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
And when...

111
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Spot with the big red, like, Kohai.

112
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Oh, okay, hold on.

113
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm so hungry, I wish I could have a caramel cookie!

114
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
How much are you selling your shit again for?

115
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Like fireworks, I'm working on my very own invention right now.

116
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I only got the sparklers now, mine giving up.

117
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
One buy one for 500 coins.

118
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Ah, how much is it?

119
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
500 coins is a lot, right?

120
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
And I don't have a lot.

121
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
This one?

122
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Red dot, red dot.

123
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Which one was the red dot?

124
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Red flag.

125
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,400
My mistake, reading comprehension isn't there.

126
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Oh, it's still here, okay.

127
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
It's still here, okay.

128
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
So they are somewhere around here still.

129
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Reading comprehension, that doesn't mean a thing to me.

130
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
I can't read, that sign won't stop me.

131
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
I was speaking of...

132
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Signs that won't stop me.

133
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Speaking of signs that won't stop me.

134
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Did you notice that I got the gamer's stops?

135
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Uh, being working, yes.

136
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
It's here.

137
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
The special banner for the special cold.

138
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
That's right.

139
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
That's right, it's a me, Masio.

140
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,400
It's a sponsored by the gamer's stops.

141
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Please use the cold, Masi.

142
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Five, ten percent off your order.

143
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,400
And if there's enough orders, I can get a waifu cup.

144
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
And maybe a flavor.

145
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Hee hee.

146
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Which is really cool.

147
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,400
By the way, gamer's stops are sending me a PR package.

148
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
So I can try it out too.

149
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,400
And so I'll let you know what's the best flavor.

150
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
A blade's...

151
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
It's beautiful, hold on.

152
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
A blade's laid, what's taking it so long?

153
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
We need to get out of here.

154
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Oh, this is just great.

155
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Mario caught up with us.

156
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
One thing we can do now.

157
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Only one thing to do now.

158
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Although we may rest a little.

159
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
We'll have to swim for it.

160
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Not so fast.

161
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,400
That stars a gift to me.

162
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Senpai.

163
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Thank you, D-man.

164
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Zero, three.

165
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Zero, two.

166
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Two.

167
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Uh, so used.

168
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
For remembering for one month.

169
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Uh, so used code mercy to get 10% off gamer's stops?

170
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Yes.

171
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
That's exactly what you're supposed to do.

172
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Please use it.

173
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
In fact, every single member in VLR has a code.

174
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
So you should use your code.

175
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,400
So you should use everyone's code six times.

176
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
So order six times.

177
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Hold on.

178
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Let me try this again.

179
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
This one's a...

180
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
That's so fast there.

181
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
That stars a gift to me, mate.

182
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Mario.

183
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
You spineless dogs have no code of honor.

184
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Honor.

185
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Honor.

186
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll make you walk the plank.

187
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Johnny, maybe you should leave Mario the pleasure

188
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
of wrapping things up here.

189
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
He...

190
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
I guess we'll have to take our disguises off now.

191
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Group formation.

192
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Ah, blinding.

193
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Oh my gosh, you look like that one guy from...

194
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Actually, what do you remind me of?

195
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm trying to remember.

196
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
I can use a trip and move now.

197
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Hold on.

198
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Clown car barrage.

199
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Yeah.

200
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Let's go.

201
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Aw, so cute.

202
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Yes.

203
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Can't block.

204
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Okay.

205
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Max mushroom.

206
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Okay.

207
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
We'll give myself the mushroom.

208
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
And then we'll do a special.

209
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Super jump, super fireball.

210
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Sure.

211
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Ah!

212
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Ah!

213
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
To your eyes, Poisonful.

214
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Actually, I think your attack is better.

215
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Ah, shit.

216
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Ah!

217
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
No!

218
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
You should pick me up.

219
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
I'll have to.

220
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
You should pick me up.

221
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I'll have four left.

222
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Thanks.

223
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Gotta free me.

224
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Oh, thank you.

225
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Okay.

226
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Let's try...

227
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Super fireball again.

228
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Or jump.

229
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Let's try jump.

230
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Super jump?

231
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
I can try super jump.

232
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Ah!

233
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
I'm stuck in it!

234
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
You use most party energy, I'd say.

235
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
No.

236
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Mid mushroom.

237
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
There.

238
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Use the mushroom.

239
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Thank you.

240
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,400
He's gonna fucking die at this rate.

241
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Why can't I block it?

242
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Ah!

243
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Okay, let's switch.

244
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
There you go.

245
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
There you go.

246
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Ah, fuck it.

247
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Just attack.

248
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
If you know Whirl.

249
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Attack some enemy.

250
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Sure.

251
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Well, I am so bad at timing, never mind.

252
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Mirage attack.

253
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Fuck it, just do the beam.

254
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Yo!

255
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Whee!

256
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Please be poisoned.

257
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Fuck!

258
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Ah!

259
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
My gaming!

260
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
My gaming sucks!

261
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
I'm not a gamer!

262
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Why did I think I could game?

263
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Ah!

264
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Okay.

265
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
I can do it.

266
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Let's do honey sheerle.

267
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Ugh.

268
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Ah, come on.

269
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Am I just a lousy?

270
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Yeah.

271
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Okay.

272
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Switch him out with Siege.

273
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
BP time.

274
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Ah, just attack.

275
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
I gotta get better at this somehow.

276
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Ah!

277
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Okay, maybe I can zoink him out.

278
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Is it sheep?

279
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Ah!

280
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
It's not looking good.

281
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
It's not looking good, Senpai.

282
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Not looking good, Senpai.

283
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Here is my thing.

284
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Pick me up.

285
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Okay, maybe you can do an attack up.

286
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Me?

287
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Am I supposed to just tank this?

288
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Okay.

289
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Okay, let's hug Mario.

290
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Good.

291
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
I need a therapy myself!

292
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Hug myself!

293
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Hug yourself.

294
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Hug me.

295
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Okay.

296
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Gonna need more FP.

297
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Can I switch her out?

298
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Ah, everyone else is fucking dead!

299
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Senpai!

300
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Senpai!

301
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Thank you, Seltzam, for remembering.

302
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
You got this, Kai.

303
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Thank you!

304
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
I'll try my best.

305
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Well, hugs are powerful.

306
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
We're just gonna deal with it.

307
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Bitch slap.

308
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Ah!

309
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Oh, shit.

310
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Okay.

311
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I didn't realize they would be so strong.

312
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Does Peach get to have gear on?

313
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
I might have not put any gear on her.

314
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Thank you, Rai-Ramathal.

315
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Thank you for remembering for one month.

316
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Oh, I almost forgot this.

317
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Never forget again.

318
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Come on.

319
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm losing this.

320
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm losing this.

321
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I'm losing this.

322
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
I'm losing this so badly.

323
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,400
I made a mushroom from my shelf.

324
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Hmm.

325
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Hmm.

326
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Hmm.

327
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Here, use a mid mushroom.

328
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Ah, you need therapy.

329
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Oh, his FP's gone.

330
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Yay!

331
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Don't heal!

332
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Oh, that did it a lot more.

333
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Okay.

334
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Just attack.

335
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Yes!

336
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Yes!

337
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Yes!

338
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
This is looking possible!

339
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Yes!

340
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Yes!

341
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
How did we do it?

342
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
This is my star!

343
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
This is my star!

344
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I made the video lose so much

345
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
that I could not use an attack anymore.

346
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Suki!

347
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Say,

348
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
you must have been a breeze knocking down Spearie, huh?

349
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
No.

350
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
By the way,

351
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,400
my parents say they saw a huge axe flying across the sky.

352
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Probably one of Smithy's nasty friends.

353
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Go get him, pal.

354
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Sorry, that was totally the wrong accent.

355
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Well, my girls are failing on me.

356
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Wait.

357
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Err, matey.

358
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Well, my girls are failing on me,

359
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
so I'll be heading back down,

360
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,400
dropping whenever you have time, okay?

361
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Your true mate,

362
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Jonathan Johnny Jones.

363
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Yes!

364
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Whee!

365
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Is everyone alive?

366
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Phew!

367
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Thank you so much!

368
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,400
I've had enough of this crap dirty old place like this!

369
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Hey, fella,

370
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
you got us on a buying piece, bro!

371
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Wait, hey, fella,

372
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
you got us on a buying piece, brother.

373
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
It was mighty unpleasant here.

374
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Thanks for helping us out.

375
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Thank you!

376
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Ah, thanks a lot!

377
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Be sure to stop by!

378
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Yeah, stop by my!

379
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Thank you for freeing us.

380
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I've got to get back to work now,

381
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,400
but stop by in the end and see you there.

382
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Ah, Mario.

383
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Thank you for saving our little town of Seaside.

384
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Being the most important person in the village,

385
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
it was inevitable that I would be tortured.

386
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Are you immune to the tickle tortures, Mario?

387
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Ah, yes, this is for you.

388
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Please take it.

389
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Received one coin!

390
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
One coin, Senpai.

391
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
I'm so...

392
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
I'm so relieved

393
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,400
that all of the townspeople were all right in the end.

394
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Can you believe he just didn't kidnap him?

395
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
He had to nerve to lock him up, too?

396
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Me and my minions would never put a stunt like that!

397
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Really?

398
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,400
I seem to recall certain someone kidnapping me not too long ago.

399
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Grr!

400
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
But no one got hurt, right?

401
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Well, so all's well that ends well.

402
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Ha ha!

403
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Come on, let's scram already.

404
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,400
The mode in here is bad for my sensitive nostrils.

405
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Here, here.

406
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,400
We should see the sites in town now that it's back to normal.

407
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Maybe someone in here can point us to the next art piece.

408
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Tickle torture.

409
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Well, if I didn't tickle torture him so much,

410
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
how much would it have been?

411
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Yangster from Tadpole Pawn recently moved in here for good.

412
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
If you don't let the elder get tortured,

413
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
he'll give you a flower box instead.

414
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
But my sadism!

415
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Okay, out here there aren't many people passing through,

416
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
so it gets awful only sometimes.

417
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Please rest up.

418
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Only cost you 15 coins.

419
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Sure.

420
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Well, rest up.

421
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Okay.

422
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Woohoo!

423
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Whee!

424
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Yeah.

425
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,400
I gotta get a lot of stuff now.

426
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Okay, let's see what else they have.

427
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Let's just say.

428
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Welcome to Beatles Are Us!

429
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
We run a Beatles business here.

430
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Want an explanation?

431
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Yes!

432
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Huh.

433
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
That sounds like fun.

434
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
I think that's fun.

435
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Oh, they're so small they don't even look past the counter.

436
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Welcome to my living shop.

437
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Okay, let's see what we got.

438
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Koopa shell.

439
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Punch glove.

440
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Super hammer.

441
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Paratrooper shell.

442
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Lucky hammer.

443
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Symbols?

444
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Womp gloves.

445
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Ribbit stick.

446
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Finger shot.

447
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Handgun.

448
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Double punch.

449
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Shake chomp.

450
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Curly glove.

451
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Slap glove.

452
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Parasol.

453
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Please come and browse!

454
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Okay, let's see.

455
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I've got happy pants for you.

456
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Sailor pants.

457
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Like a cape.

458
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Happy cape.

459
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Sailor cape.

460
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Yeah, okay, they're all already clipped.

461
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
It's a hurly glove?

462
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Okay.

463
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
I got it.

464
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Hi, Mario.

465
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
You got a lot of health food in our store.

466
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
You've got to treat your body right.

467
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Yeah, I need it.

468
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
I am out of like pick-me-ups.

469
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Okay, cleansing juice, party cleanse.

470
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
A lot of pick-me-ups and I need...

471
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
...a lot of pick-me-ups.

472
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
I need...

473
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Mushroom boy.

474
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,400
You know that hidden amongst the regular mushrooms are some special ones.

475
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Unreal, huh?

476
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
I'll give you items in return for those special mushrooms.

477
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
You've got to taste them to find out what kind they are,

478
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
so I'll take a nibble first.

479
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I'll think for a special mushroom,

480
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
but even if it isn't,

481
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
I think I'll get a meal out of it.

482
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Do you have any mushrooms?

483
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Yeah.

484
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Okay, far out munch munch.

485
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Oh, this one's a berry mushroom.

486
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
I'll give you a maple syrup.

487
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Oh boy, I'm stuffed.

488
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Alright, like this is unreal.

489
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
It's a ripping mushroom.

490
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Rock candy.

491
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Oh boy, I'm stuffed.

492
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
I don't know...

493
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400
How do I know how many mushrooms I have?

494
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Hello there, you were so brave to rescue us,

495
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
and I'm so thankful.

496
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Listen, maybe it's time you thought more about what you wear.

497
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Festerizing is a big business these days.

498
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
See anything you like here?

499
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Zoom shoes and soot.

500
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
These look really good, but...

501
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I don't have the money.

502
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
That was just a regular mushroom.

503
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Thanks for the snack.

504
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Hello?

505
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Alright.

506
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Wait.

507
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
My bad.

508
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
I need to go back.

509
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Hold on.

510
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,400
I forgot the other house on the hill.

511
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Here.

512
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Ariel, if it's a star you're looking for,

513
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
I may be able to help you.

514
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
A four-

515
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Side of land and is a town made up of reformed monsters.

516
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Mouse came by the other day

517
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,400
and overheard them bolstering by a star of theirs.

518
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I don't know exactly where this town is located,

519
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
but if you follow the road, you get there.

520
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Okay.

521
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Okay.

522
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Three, four monsters.

523
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
To help their extra nice.

524
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Have you seen the sea before?

525
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
It sure is vast.

526
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Definitely worth the trip.

527
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
Now you want to go through the ocean again?

528
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Where's the shed?

529
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
I have a key for a shed.

530
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Oh, wait.

531
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
This is the shed.

532
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
I got the key for that.

533
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Wow.

534
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
I'm stupid.

535
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
I got it.

536
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Oh, same.

537
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,400
Oh, same.

538
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Look at this.

539
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
There you go.

540
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
That's rude.

541
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
You hooked on the princess.

542
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
You son of a bitch.

543
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
You son of a bitch.

544
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
Level up.

545
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
Yay.

546
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
I think Bowser's physical, right?

547
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,400
Yeah.

548
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Shogun, huh?

549
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Okay.

550
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
I don't like the way you look.

551
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Yay.

552
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Thanks for the attack up.

553
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,400
Okay.

554
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Okay.

555
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Die.

556
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Shogun.

557
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
She knows how to show his gun.

558
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Yeah.

559
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Okay.

560
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
One more.

561
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Come on.

562
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
I don't like that flower.

563
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
It has lips.

564
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
It...

565
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
It looks disturbed me.

566
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Oh, I really did.

567
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Okay.

568
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Oh, man.

569
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
No, Gino!

570
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Okay.

571
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
Okay.

572
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,400
Okay.

573
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,400
Okay.

574
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Okay.

575
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
Okay.

576
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
Okay.

577
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Okay.

578
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Okay.

579
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Okay.

580
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Okay.

581
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Oh!

582
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
You son of a bitch!

583
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
Okay.

584
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Oh, my gosh.

585
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
That was kind of evil.

586
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,400
It's up there.

587
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,400
How do I get up there?

588
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Okay.

589
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,400
Fuck.

590
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Fuck.

591
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
Fuck.

592
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
Fuck.

593
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
Why are there so many of you?!

594
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Bear us all.

595
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Okay.

596
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
Okay.

597
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,400
Bitch slap.

598
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Okay.

599
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Hmm.

600
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,400
Wait.

601
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,400
Wait.

602
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Is that a mini Mario?!

603
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,400
Just needed Peach to go away for a little bit.

604
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400
Mario reached level 13.

605
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,400
I'll say physical.

606
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
So!

607
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,400
No!

608
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Ah!

609
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
He's doing Mario!

610
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,400
Actually, I thought it was just a Mario doll!

611
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Step pie!

612
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
Step pie!

613
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,400
Step pie!

614
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Thank you for the immense funny boy!

615
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
I suck at this.

616
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Just attacking Mario.

617
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,400
Cowardly.

618
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Ah!

619
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,400
Come on!

620
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
No!

621
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,400
No!

622
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
Why are you literally?!

623
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Why do you die all the time?!

624
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Why do you die all the time?!

625
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,400
How do you get one shot every single time?!

626
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Ah!

627
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,400
Ah!

628
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
Ah!

629
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Ah!

630
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
This is hell.

631
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,400
Fuck!

632
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Never mind.

633
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,400
I'm fucking screwed.

634
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Nope, everyone's fucking dead.

635
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Oh hi!

636
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Did you know you can block attacks?!

637
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,400
I've been trying to block attacks.

638
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,400
I just don't have the skills to do that!

639
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:19,400
I just don't have the skills to actually do it!

640
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,400
To pull it off!

641
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,400
We are now going to grind levels because I suck.

642
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:46,400
That was a place to get good stuff.

643
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,400
I have no money!

644
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Just like real life!

645
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,400
It all goes to bills.

646
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:17,400
I also want beetles.

647
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
The fee is 101.

648
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,400
I want up the beetles too.

649
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,400
I want to get up the beetles too.

650
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,400
I want to get up the beetles too.

651
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,400
I want to get up the beetles too.

652
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,400
I want to get up the beetles too.

653
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Oh, I have that already.

654
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,400
I have all those items.

655
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Let me go back to my box.

656
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,400
Maybe I can pick up some items from my box.

657
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Maybe I had some stuff in my box.

658
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Oops, not that one.

659
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,400
Wait, I have things that aren't equipped?

660
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,400
Let me go back to my box.

661
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
Ailing pants.

662
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I think we're good there.

663
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Give me my stuff.

664
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Take max of everything.

665
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,400
Thank you.

666
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Go through my accessories.

667
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Give us a sec.

668
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,400
Give us a sec.

669
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Booster's charm.

670
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,400
I thought booster's charm was good.

671
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Nurturing.

672
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
Booster's charm.

673
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Use safety ring.

674
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,400
Safety ring.

675
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Booster's charm is better for Bowser.

676
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
Some shoes.

677
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,400
Booster's charm.

678
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Another safety badge.

679
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,400
Because you are paper.

680
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Doomshoes are great for Gino.

681
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,400
Okay, thank you, senpais.

682
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Boom.

683
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,400
Good.

684
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
I wonder if I'll be okay now.

685
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,400
Star Hill? We'll train at Star Hill then?

686
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
Let's do some grinding!

687
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Whatever, we'll go into any of them.

688
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
RPGs grind!

689
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,400
Get over here!

690
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Get over here!

691
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,400
We are now.

692
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,400
Get over here!

693
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
Get over here!

694
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Die.

695
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,400
Are you the other star me?

696
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
What a terrible move!

697
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,400
What a terrible move! Migraine!

698
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
Get over here!

699
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,400
I can use recovery items in the field like X.

700
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,400
I can use all of these? Yes!

701
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,400
Get over here!

702
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,400
Alright!

703
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
Get over here!

704
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,400
Thank you.

705
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,400
You need magic.

706
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,400
Get over here!

707
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,400
Holy shit, it went down!

708
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,400
Let's see!

709
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,400
It throws a bone!

710
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,400
Let's go!

711
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
Sure. Where's Yoshi?

712
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,400
Yay!

713
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
Yeah, Yoshi!

714
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,400
Yeah, my eyes are so good.

715
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,400
Hey, where's the play that I came from?

716
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,400
Oh shit.

717
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,400
There you go.

718
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,400
Okay.

719
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,400
Fuck.

720
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Yay!

721
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,400
Dino is a magic guy, right?

722
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,400
Yeah.

723
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,400
Yeah.

724
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,400
Fuck.

725
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,400
There you go.

726
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
How did I get back out?

727
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,400
You don't remember how to get back out?

728
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,400
Oh, this one.

729
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,400
Me and...

730
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,400
Isn't Johnny's ship a better grind spot?

731
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,400
You're probably right.

732
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,400
And I'm already lost.

733
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,400
This one?

734
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,400
No, I already looked at that one.

735
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,400
Here's the other one.

736
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,400
Oh, there it is.

737
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,400
There it is.

738
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,400
How did I get out of here?

739
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,400
Come here, Leaf!

740
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
There you go.

741
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,400
Thank you.

742
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,400
The ship then?

743
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
Okay.

744
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,400
Wait, is this the same sign?

745
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,400
Yeah.

746
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,400
I go through here.

747
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,400
I totally forgot how to do this area.

748
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
Oh yeah, the mice.

749
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,400
Oh, thank you.

750
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,400
Yeah.

751
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,400
Hi.

752
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,400
Yeah.

753
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,400
Maybe bells are...

754
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,400
Let me in.

755
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,400
That's a water thing, right?

756
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,400
Yeah!

757
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
Oops.

758
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,400
Okay.

759
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
I suck at this so bad.

760
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,400
Ah, he just drills!

761
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,400
Mario!

762
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,400
Come on.

763
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,400
Can I use Peach's power?

764
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,400
Oh, wait, is he okay?

765
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
You never mind, he's okay.

766
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,400
I love how we go through here.

767
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,400
He's grinding too.

768
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,400
It's like status effects wear off at the end of the battle.

769
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,400
This is Nocturne Mercy.

770
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,400
I'm mixing up my RPGs, this is what happens.

771
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:27,400
This is what happens when you've got like three RPGs running at the same time.

772
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,400
You've got Nocturne, I've got Wild Arms,

773
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
I've got Mario,

774
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,400
and I'm thinking about getting another one!

775
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,400
Oh gosh, he's so hot suddenly.

776
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
Okay.

777
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,400
The big blur of RPGs!

778
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,400
And I haven't touched Mario RPG in a hot second.

779
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,400
Hello, thank you.

780
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,400
Okay.

781
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,400
I just want him to like throw Mario around all the time.

782
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,400
Okay.

783
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
Peach is a magic girl, right?

784
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,400
Oh, thank you!

785
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,400
Revive a pal!

786
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,400
Thank you!

787
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,400
Come back, revive a pal if it goes well.

788
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Feel the...

789
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,400
Yes, she's a magic gal, right?

790
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,400
She's a magic gal.

791
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,400
You think we're at a good level?

792
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,400
Okay.

793
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,400
I'll go check what my level is now.

794
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,400
Can I actually... hold on.

795
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,400
How do I check their level?

796
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,400
13, 13, 13, 13, 13.

797
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,400
What do you think?

798
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,400
Okay.

799
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,400
Do we have enough frog coins now?

800
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,400
Alright, we have enough frog coins for the...

801
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,400
For the Confucius Frog.

802
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,400
Other Confucius Frog.

803
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,400
Okay.

804
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,400
I don't have enough!

805
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,400
I need one more!

806
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,400
I need one more.

807
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,400
Yeah.

808
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,400
I think the only thing I...

809
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,400
want are the Beatles RS.

810
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,400
It's kind of expensive.

811
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,400
Like, I don't know how much I have.

812
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,400
It's not that much.

813
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
We've got plenty of money.

814
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,400
Do you think I should get some Beatles RS?

815
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,400
Ah, sure.

816
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,400
Can you see some ID, please?

817
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,400
Everything looks fine!

818
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,400
All you just jumped a show ID!

819
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,400
Easy beat-a-locks. Good luck and happy hunting.

820
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,400
So, do I just go back to Booster's place?

821
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,400
Booster Tower?

822
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,400
Is there a hill?

823
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,400
There's no way there's Booster Hill, alright.

824
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,400
Booster's Pass and Booster Tower.

825
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,400
Oh, no wait, there's Booster Hill.

826
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,400
Wow, I'm stupid!

827
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,400
How do I catch these freaking Beatles?

828
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,400
Ready for Beatles RS?

829
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,400
Do you need instructions?

830
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,400
Yes!

831
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,400
Left, right, or jump?

832
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,400
Can't go forwards or backwards.

833
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,400
Right.

834
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,400
Touch the sniffsters or any of the barrel

835
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,400
and you'll fall back.

836
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,400
Oh, yeah, I remember!

837
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,400
That was really hard!

838
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,400
I remember this was really hard.

839
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,400
Oops!

840
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,400
I want a Beatles!

841
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,400
You can move, I'm doing better!

842
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,400
I want a Beatles!

843
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,400
I want a Beatles!

844
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,400
I want a Beatles!

845
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,400
Fuck you!

846
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,400
I want a Beatles!

847
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,400
Congratulations, seven Beatles!

848
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,400
Hi, females, two males!

849
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,400
Yay!

850
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Then I can go back here, right?

851
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,400
Be like,

852
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,400
Yeah meme!

853
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,400
Yeah, Beatles!

854
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,400
I thought we were just like, you know...

855
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,400
You made 105 coins!

856
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,400
Good doing business with ya!

857
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,400
Thank you!

858
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,400
Okay, we'll rest up again.

859
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,400
I actually took a nap

860
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,400
before streaming

861
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,400
and I was...

862
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,400
I told mama, wake me up!

863
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,400
And then she scared me

864
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,400
when she woke me up!

865
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,400
I'm not used to this new time, so...

866
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,400
Alright!

867
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,400
My timing's bad!

868
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,400
Dang it!

869
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,400
Hit me again!

870
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,400
Getting it!

871
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,400
Hit me again!

872
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,400
I like him throwing Mario, it's great!

873
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,400
Raiders!

874
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,400
Sorry!

875
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,400
Who raided?

876
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,400
I missed it!

877
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,400
Hello, Salami, welcome to the stream!

878
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,400
What were you doing?

879
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,400
Sorry, I missed it!

880
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,400
That's a big spider.

881
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,400
I missed it and I was too busy gaming!

882
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
Welcome to the stream!

883
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,400
My name is Mercy Modis

884
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,400
from VLRS Gen 1 Indulge!

885
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,400
Nice to meet you!

886
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,400
Sorry!

887
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,400
I'm Masio!

888
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,400
Masio!

889
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,400
It's me, Masio!

890
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,400
Welcome to the stream!

891
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,400
I totally forgot!

892
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,400
I'm Masio!

893
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,400
Masio!

894
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,400
Welcome to the stream!

895
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,400
We are playing the Mario RPG!

896
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,400
How was the karaoke?

897
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,400
X, fire! Die first!

898
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,400
Okay, I'm getting it!

899
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,400
Slowly!

900
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,400
There you go!

901
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,400
Our nice circulation is...

902
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,400
The one weeb song!

903
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,400
That was really popular!

904
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,400
The one weeb song!

905
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,400
Stage up!

906
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,400
Oh yeah!

907
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,400
Wrong one! I wanted to hit the spider again!

908
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,400
Oh, thank you!

909
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,400
Actually, I got the one scan, that's okay.

910
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,400
No.

911
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,400
Kino beam!

912
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,400
Woohoo!

913
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,400
Son of a bitch!

914
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,400
I mean, sorry! Son of a page!

915
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,400
You can get in my shrooms!

916
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,400
I'm gaming, sort of!

917
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,400
I got one fraud coin!

918
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,400
I can go back!

919
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,400
I don't wanna!

920
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,400
Oops, sorry!

921
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,400
Yay!

922
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,400
Son of a beach!

923
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,400
I'm so glad they're hurting each other!

924
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,400
Aww, look at that!

925
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:05,400
You know, these geckos kind of remind me of scrawny!

926
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,400
Geckos, these geckos kind of look like scrawny, right?

927
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,400
Yay, level up Bowser!

928
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,400
Thank you, Bowser, for reaching level.

929
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,400
I think you're more physical.

930
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,400
Yeah, physical.

931
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,400
Oh, there we go.

932
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,400
Am I actually just supposed to, like, be here?

933
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,400
Racer!

934
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,400
Oh, I see where I was supposed to go.

935
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,400
And I failed, spectacularly!

936
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,400
I'll save these for later.

937
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,400
Shit.

938
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,400
Oh, it hit itself!

939
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,400
Oh, it hit itself!

940
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,400
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

941
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,400
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

942
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,400
I'm a gamer!

943
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,400
Yeah, gaming!

944
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,400
Yeah, gaming!

945
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,400
Oh save part!

946
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,400
Save!

947
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,400
Wahoo! These guys look horrible!

948
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,400
Oh fuck.

949
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,400
How bad are these guys?

950
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,400
Stingers look pretty bad.

951
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,400
Oh thank goodness they died!

952
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,400
I don't like you flower!

953
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,400
Gaming, gaming, gaming!

954
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,400
I'll look like a picture of a lot of new people here!

955
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,400
Thank you!

956
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,400
Thank you for checking me out!

957
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,400
Wahoo!

958
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,400
Okay.

959
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,400
Maybe there's actually stuff over here.

960
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,400
Cool stuff.

961
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,400
Hidden stuff.

962
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,400
Secret stuff even.

963
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,400
Yes!

964
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,400
Flower tab!

965
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

966
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,400
Do I use all these?

967
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:51,400
Are these like, um, perma, perma, perma,

968
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,400
perma, flower tabs or perma, right?

969
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,400
Okay, okay.

970
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,400
Use them all!

971
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,400
What about flower jar?

972
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,400
That's perma too, right?

973
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,400
Flower jar is perma.

974
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

975
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,400
Yeah.

976
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,400
Yeah.

977
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,400
Yeah.

978
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,400
Yeah.

979
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,400
Okay, cool.

980
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,400
Hmm.

981
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,400
Bump.

982
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,400
Yeah.

983
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,400
You win!

984
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,400
Woo!

985
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,400
You're also physical, right, Mario?

986
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,400
Ultra jump!

987
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,400
Hmm.

988
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,400
Ah.

989
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,400
There's too many of them!

990
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,400
Wheeee!

991
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,400
Oh, yeah.

992
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,400
I'm gonna try.

993
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,400
Hi.

994
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,400
Now I'm gonna just do the super jump again.

995
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,400
I'm gaming!

996
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,400
So, I'm such a gamer!

997
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:34,400
Snowy, a snowfall, man fell, fells full.

998
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,400
Hmm.

999
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,400
Okay, magic.

1000
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,400
Does this mean I jump down?

1001
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,400
Oh, hi!

1002
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,400
Welcome to Skybridge!

1003
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,400
It's a big tourist attraction here.

1004
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,400
Yahoo!

1005
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,400
Wanna challenge it?

1006
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,400
Sure.

1007
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,400
Okay, I need five coins from you.

1008
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,400
You need an explanation?

1009
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,400
Yeah.

1010
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,400
What do you mean?

1011
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,400
You can cross the Skybridge in one of three ways.

1012
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,400
However, if you fall at any time, you'll lose.

1013
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,400
Normal course, the blocks won't fall.

1014
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:13,400
You can jump to the next block by tilting left button in the direction you're going,

1015
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,400
then press B.

1016
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,400
You get five coins for that.

1017
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,400
A special course, jumping works the same as the normal course,

1018
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,400
but the blocks will fall if you stand on them too long.

1019
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,400
You'll get eight coins there.

1020
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:27,400
An expert course, the block will fall and jumps are harder.

1021
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,400
You'll get a fraud coin there.

1022
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:33,400
On all the courses, you have to jump and avoid bullet guys.

1023
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,400
And, of course, do you want normal, please?

1024
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,400
Yahoo!

1025
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,400
Good luck to ya!

1026
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,400
What am I supposed to do?

1027
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,400
Oh, like...

1028
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,400
Ah!

1029
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,400
Holy shit!

1030
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,400
Ah!

1031
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,400
Holy shit!

1032
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,400
Going up?

1033
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,400
I'll give you a boost to jump on top of me.

1034
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,400
I don't want to.

1035
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,400
Fuck you.

1036
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,400
I'm cheating the system.

1037
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,400
That cost me five coins, man!

1038
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,400
I'm not going to jump on top of you.

1039
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,400
I'm not going to jump on top of you.

1040
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,400
I'm not going to jump on top of you.

1041
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,400
Five coins, man!

1042
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,400
Oh!

1043
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,400
It's a mouse.

1044
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,400
Ah!

1045
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,400
Okay, hold on.

1046
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,400
Yeah!

1047
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,400
I haven't been here in a while.

1048
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,400
I haven't been busy traveling along.

1049
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,400
Are you heading to the Monstro Town by Vanitya?

1050
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,400
Yeah!

1051
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,400
Okay, listen up.

1052
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,400
Look for the Whirl when the ants pop up and proceed after it.

1053
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,400
You follow it and you'll find your way underground.

1054
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,400
That's there.

1055
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,400
Monstro Town is just around the corner.

1056
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,400
I'll see you there.

1057
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,400
Ants?

1058
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,400
You want ants?

1059
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,400
This is how you get ants.

1060
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,400
The one with ants?

1061
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,400
Oh, that one.

1062
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,400
Come on.

1063
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,400
Like this?

1064
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,400
Is that what they're asking me to do?

1065
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,400
Oh, shit.

1066
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,400
Shit.

1067
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:02,400
Shit.

1068
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,400
I'm so stupid.

1069
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,400
I got the wrong one.

1070
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,400
I got the wrong bitch.

1071
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,400
Okay.

1072
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,400
That was my bad.

1073
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,400
Yeah.

1074
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,400
Penal blast.

1075
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,400
This beam hits awful.

1076
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,400
Oh, that's good.

1077
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,400
That's good.

1078
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,400
Wait.

1079
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,400
Wait, what was the instruction?

1080
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,400
I don't get it.

1081
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,400
Sorry, what was the instruction?

1082
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,400
Oh.

1083
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,400
Shit.

1084
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,400
Ah, shit.

1085
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,400
Oh, that was nice.

1086
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,400
That's nice.

1087
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,400
Shit.

1088
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,400
Oh, sorry.

1089
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,400
Did I go to the wrong one?

1090
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,400
Did I go after this one?

1091
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,400
Oi!

1092
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,400
That's kind of mean.

1093
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,400
Shit.

1094
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,400
Shit.

1095
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,400
He jumped to the other hall.

1096
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,400
Shit.

1097
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,400
These ants are cheating.

1098
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,400
I don't even know which one it is.

1099
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,400
This one?

1100
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,400
Shit.

1101
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,400
Oh, shit.

1102
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:43,400
Shit.

1103
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,400
Yes!

1104
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,400
Should I put Peach to have more magic?

1105
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,400
Or more physical?

1106
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,400
Maybe not physical?

1107
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,400
Okay, magic it is then.

1108
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,400
Ah.

1109
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,400
Am I there?

1110
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,400
Yeah.

1111
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,400
Bowser, boo!

1112
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,400
Hold up.

1113
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,400
Alright, I can use the infield.

1114
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,400
Not bad, I forgot.

1115
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,400
Right.

1116
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,400
Hold on, read the instructions.

1117
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,400
Totally, totally blanked out.

1118
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,400
Okay, is it here?

1119
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,400
Oh.

1120
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,400
Ah!

1121
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:57,400
Crush your earth eruption hit a right after the rock pokes out.

1122
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,400
Dillum Temple.

1123
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:12,400
Rounded coins, this shortcut will take you back to the surface, no thanks.

1124
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:30,400
You want your fortune told? It'll cost 50 coins.

1125
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,400
I did the fortune yesterday.

1126
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,400
Wait, should I?

1127
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,400
Should I get my fortune told?

1128
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,400
Should I get my fortune told?

1129
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,400
Someone will give me a star?

1130
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,400
Hold on.

1131
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,400
Ah.

1132
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,400
Okay.

1133
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,400
Behind the pox is past the springs.

1134
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,400
Physical.

1135
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,400
Oh.

1136
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,400
Magic.

1137
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,400
Here?

1138
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,400
Lucky for a star, I'm selling 400 coins, are you interested?

1139
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,400
That's a lot of coins, Senpai!

1140
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,400
Okay.

1141
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:08,400

Oh, thank you.

1147
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:11,400
Well, it's useless to get a once again when they're dead.

1148
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,400
Magic.

1149
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,400
Magic.

1150
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,400
Not gonna lie, the grind cost a lot of money.

1151
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,400
Is there anything over here?

1152
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,400
So, should I get my fortune told, Senpai?

1153
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,400
Should I get my fortune told?

1154
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,400
Yeah?

1155
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:08,400
Be the face on the wall, hit any of them in order, and you'll receive your fortune.

1156
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,400
Wait, what?

Sometimes if you jump at the right place a treasure box will pop out of thin air. You like that happen to you

1220
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,960
Your box are known as hidden treasures because they appear out of nowhere

You think you found them all but still but you still have 39 hidden treasures left wait really

1231
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:19,440

02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:58,720
Now you must think of a final phrase that will wrap it all up, let your creative juices flow and show me what you got.

1481
02:41:58,720 --> 02:42:11,720
Wait, do I just, do I just, uh, do I just, just make a song now, Senpai?

1482
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:44,720
Okay, here we go, let's do this, it's our song.

1483
02:42:45,720 --> 02:43:11,720
Huh?

1484
02:43:11,720 --> 02:43:21,720
I can't believe I wasn't beeping boops! What do you think? Let's hear it again!

1485
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:49,720
Yeah! That was great.

1486
02:43:52,720 --> 02:44:09,720
Nevermind, that was great. E that way, shut up! We did it! We did it!

1487
02:44:09,720 --> 02:44:13,720
Would it sound different if I recompose it?

1488
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:24,720
Your composition is pretty good, thank you. Greatest composer of our time, Merciel.

1489
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:30,720
I'm winking, but you can't tell.

1490
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:36,720
I think my ending was pretty good. Wooden flower, right?

1491
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:42,720
Did Rosetown have a wooden flower?

1492
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:47,720
Yeah!

1493
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:55,720
Wooden flower, uh, green bed, huh?

1494
02:44:55,720 --> 02:45:05,720
Where is the green bed?

1495
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:08,720
Is it my house?

1496
02:45:08,720 --> 02:45:18,720
Mollyo's house have green beds?

1497
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:26,720
Okay, this is green.

1498
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:34,720
Hell yeah, look at that! I'm so fucking smart!

1499
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:51,720
What's ONA, though? Between ONA? ONA, don't call.

1500
02:45:51,720 --> 02:46:07,720
Was there a place with ONA?

1501
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:15,720
ONA, were there letters in places?

1502
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:24,720
Is it the ship? Is it the fucking ship?

1503
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:32,720
I don't want to go back to the sunken ship. Not the ship, okay, good.

1504
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:48,720
Marymore?

1505
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:53,720
Do we have letters anywhere?

1506
02:46:53,720 --> 02:47:04,720
I'm trying to remember a place that had any letters.

1507
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:14,720
And they said a shiny rock here, right?

1508
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:19,720
ONA.

1509
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:22,720
I'm gonna feel a little silly when I come across it.

1510
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:39,720
Don't tell me it's the fucking title screen, right?

1511
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:46,720
It's not my house again, is it?

1512
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:53,720
It's not my house again. There's an ONA in my house.

1513
02:47:53,720 --> 02:48:03,720
ONA!

1514
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:43,720
The Yostar Island?

1515
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:52,720
Are there letters here?

1516
02:48:52,720 --> 02:49:01,720
What the fuck? I'm so good! I'm a fucking god!

1517
02:49:01,720 --> 02:49:11,720
I'm a fucking god of this! Wow, easy!

1518
02:49:11,720 --> 02:49:24,720
How do you feel, Senpai? Your life is a god of puzzles!

1519
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:41,720
I did it! I did it, I did it!

1520
02:49:41,720 --> 02:49:48,720
Now give me cool stuff.

1521
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:52,720
Good job, you found all three flags!

1522
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:57,720
Hey, you're not half bad. You did pretty well.

1523
02:49:57,720 --> 02:50:00,720
And a great time too, thanks for playing our game!

1524
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:07,720
And a grand prize giveaway!

1525
02:50:07,720 --> 02:50:11,720
Very well, and good morning!

1526
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:16,720
What did I get?

1527
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:29,720
Okay, what did I get? Did I get a level up or something?

1528
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:37,720
Massure?

1529
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:48,720
Ghost medal! Double's defense! There we go!

1530
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:54,720
And I need...

1531
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:57,720
There's still this evil that...

1532
02:50:57,720 --> 02:51:04,720
There's still...

1533
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:08,720
I'm so fucking smart though.

1534
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:13,720
I was like, where's this very silly place for it to be?

1535
02:51:13,720 --> 02:51:18,720
It's like I need to remember places that had words.

1536
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:20,720
Crystal.

1537
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:41,720
Are we talking about the moleville?

1538
02:51:41,720 --> 02:51:53,720
Wait, the shiny stone!

1539
02:51:53,720 --> 02:52:05,720
Oh, money!

1540
02:52:05,720 --> 02:52:20,720
Money!

1541
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:22,720
My money!

1542
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:29,720
Better fucking be worth it, man!

1543
02:52:52,720 --> 02:53:11,720
Look, the shiny stone is reacting! See how it's been broken!

1544
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:15,720
What is this?

1545
02:53:15,720 --> 02:53:19,720
Wait, huh?

1546
02:53:19,720 --> 02:53:25,720
Greetings. I am Kulex, Dark Knight of Vanda.

1547
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:30,720
I've crossed into this dimension to fight the Dark Maid.

1548
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:34,720
You look like you're from a fucking different game!

1549
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:38,720
You who stand before me, where does your death come from?

1550
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:44,720
Why are you rendered so three-dimensionally?

1551
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:50,720
The evil power that gave me life mapped out this flat plain as my form.

1552
02:53:50,720 --> 02:53:53,720
You were formed from a power unknown to me.

1553
02:53:53,720 --> 02:54:01,720
I wish to gain the secret of your three-dimensional world!

1554
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:05,720
Will you enter combat against me?

1555
02:54:05,720 --> 02:54:21,720
You're wise to hesitate. Without any weapons or armor, you have no chance.

1556
02:54:21,720 --> 02:54:29,720
I guess I'll try again.

1557
02:54:29,720 --> 02:54:33,720
Yeah!

1558
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:40,720
Wait! Who are you from?

1559
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:43,720
Are you from Final Fantasy? I've never played Final Fantasy!

1560
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:48,720
I am Anti-Matter. I can see your past.

1561
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:50,720
I can see your future.

1562
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:53,720
I consume time.

1563
02:54:53,720 --> 02:54:56,720
And I will consume you.

1564
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:27,720
I can see your future.

1565
02:55:27,720 --> 02:55:30,720
I can see your future.

1566
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:33,720
I can see your future.

1567
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:36,720
I can see your future.

1568
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:39,720
I can see your future.

1569
02:55:39,720 --> 02:55:42,720
I can see your future.

1570
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:45,720
I can see your future.

1571
02:55:45,720 --> 02:55:48,720
I can see your future.

1572
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:51,720
I can see your future.

1573
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:54,720
Ow!

1574
02:55:54,720 --> 02:55:56,720
Ow!

1575
02:55:56,720 --> 02:55:59,720
Ow!

1576
02:55:59,720 --> 02:56:03,720
Ow!

1577
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:08,720
Ow! Wait! Why is there a dog star? Ow!

1578
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:24,720
I can see your future.

1579
02:56:24,720 --> 02:56:27,720
I can see your future.

1580
02:56:27,720 --> 02:56:30,720
I can see your future.

1581
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:33,720
I can see your future.

1582
02:56:33,720 --> 02:56:36,720
I can see your future.

1583
02:56:36,720 --> 02:56:39,720
I can see your future.

1584
02:56:39,720 --> 02:56:42,720
I can see your future.

1585
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:45,720
I can see your future.

1586
02:56:45,720 --> 02:56:48,720
I can see your future.

1587
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:51,720
I can see your future.

1588
02:56:51,720 --> 02:56:54,720
I can see your future.

1589
02:56:54,720 --> 02:56:58,720
I can see your future.

1590
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:21,720
I can see your future.

1591
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:25,720
I can see your future.

1592
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:28,720
I can see your future.

1593
02:57:28,720 --> 02:57:31,720
I can see your future.

1594
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:36,720
I can see your future.

1595
02:57:36,720 --> 02:57:39,720
I can see your future.

1596
02:57:39,720 --> 02:57:42,720
I can see your future.

1597
02:57:42,720 --> 02:57:46,720
I can see your future.

1598
02:57:48,720 --> 02:57:55,720
That's the super boss!

1599
02:57:55,720 --> 02:58:04,720
Oh, what do I do with this... this rock now?

1600
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:12,720
What do I do with this rock now?

1601
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:28,720
Now I have a chenny rock!

1602
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:52,720
Just hold on to it! Do I?

1603
02:58:52,720 --> 02:59:02,720
Alright then, um...

1604
02:59:02,720 --> 02:59:07,720
Can we trade it?

1605
02:59:07,720 --> 02:59:13,720
Wait, is rain? Oh wait, rain? Do you like Final Fantasy?

1606
02:59:13,720 --> 02:59:23,720
I can't remember who wanted the shiny stone!

1607
02:59:43,720 --> 02:59:56,720
Use the stone to open the door! Wait, is my stone gone then?

1608
02:59:56,720 --> 03:00:23,720
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

1609
03:00:23,720 --> 03:00:36,720
I can't remember how I'm supposed to get to a new place, right? Here?

1610
03:00:53,720 --> 03:01:10,720
Hmm? You wouldn't want to give it away anyway, Colhite. You did the last stream and got one item, so it was a waste of money. Just hold on to it until you face the boss again.

1611
03:01:10,720 --> 03:01:24,720
Okay. Okay.

1612
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:31,720
Oh, fuck.

1613
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:40,720
It's always you guys.

1614
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:49,720
Oh! Heart Beach!

1615
03:01:49,720 --> 03:01:58,720
Oh, that was really strong, actually! Stupid wolf trap.

1616
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:46,720
Oh, look at that! I blocked it! Wow! I missed that one, though.

1617
03:02:46,720 --> 03:02:54,720
Fuck.

1618
03:02:54,720 --> 03:02:59,720
Let's go!

1619
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:06,720
Hi, Colhite. I've been lurking, but I should say something to let you know I'm around.

1620
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:29,720
Have I ever told you? I always want to make that joke like, be there or be square because you're not around.

1621
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:44,720
Wow, I am bad.

1622
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:57,720
I can make these jumps.

1623
03:03:57,720 --> 03:04:11,720
Goodbye.

1624
03:04:11,720 --> 03:04:17,720
Oh, Bowser leveled up! Bowser!

1625
03:04:17,720 --> 03:04:22,720
He's a cool.

1626
03:04:22,720 --> 03:04:30,720
He's a cool. Whoa!

1627
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:37,720
Is it... pretty close, I think.

1628
03:04:37,720 --> 03:04:48,720
Is it this one over here?

1629
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:52,720
No, I don't think it's this one, right? It has to be the one there.

1630
03:04:52,720 --> 03:05:01,720
Wait, this game is actually so cute. It's my mommy! Everybody say hi, mommy!

1631
03:05:01,720 --> 03:05:21,720
It's actually too addictive. This might be a problem, Senpai, because I signed up for yoga tomorrow!

1632
03:05:22,720 --> 03:05:39,720
Yeah! You win!

1633
03:05:39,720 --> 03:05:48,720
Get him! Get him again!

1634
03:05:48,720 --> 03:05:58,720
Oh!

1635
03:05:58,720 --> 03:06:06,720
So... here?

1636
03:06:06,720 --> 03:06:14,720
Fuck you. I'm not doing this again.

1637
03:06:14,720 --> 03:06:21,720
Yeah.

1638
03:06:21,720 --> 03:06:38,720
Does this feel like another path area?

1639
03:06:38,720 --> 03:06:51,720
Tell them about the clip we are getting of you from this game. Wait, what? Wait, there's a clip?

1640
03:06:51,720 --> 03:07:07,720
Wait, there's a clip?

1641
03:07:07,720 --> 03:07:15,720
Oh, the clip where you can't jump in the sea!

1642
03:07:15,720 --> 03:07:23,720
I remember that!

1643
03:07:23,720 --> 03:07:31,720
I remember that!

1644
03:07:31,720 --> 03:07:47,720
Wait, there's more over here.

1645
03:07:48,720 --> 03:08:09,720
Oh, troops in position. Mario, your mission is to scale the cliff by jumping shell to shell.

1646
03:08:09,720 --> 03:08:19,720
Don't give up. Sure, instead he does it now. Try it again.

1647
03:08:19,720 --> 03:08:29,720
No!

1648
03:08:30,720 --> 03:08:55,720
No, no!

1649
03:08:55,720 --> 03:09:05,720
Wait, it didn't punish me as much!

1650
03:09:05,720 --> 03:09:08,720
Never mind.

1651
03:09:08,720 --> 03:09:15,720
Did I mention platforming hard?

1652
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:35,720
No!

1653
03:09:35,720 --> 03:10:04,720
No!

1654
03:10:04,720 --> 03:10:10,720
Yeah! Yes! Yes!

1655
03:10:10,720 --> 03:10:16,720
Mission complete! Elapsed is 24. Shut up!

1656
03:10:16,720 --> 03:10:27,720
Not bad for a civilian. Shut up. Let me out of here.

1657
03:10:27,720 --> 03:10:38,720
Do it faster for an item? A what item?

1658
03:10:38,720 --> 03:10:48,720
Okay, where am I supposed to go? Bean Valley. Okay.

1659
03:10:48,720 --> 03:10:58,720
I hate flowers and I hate these, these, these, these Conti flowers!

1660
03:10:58,720 --> 03:11:10,720
Don't be a Conti flower!

1661
03:11:18,720 --> 03:11:33,720
Okay, jump!

1662
03:11:33,720 --> 03:11:47,720
I mean welcome raiders! Now I actually see someone!

1663
03:11:47,720 --> 03:12:00,720
Welcome my me! Hello raiders, welcome to the stream! Oh, he flowers love.

1664
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:07,720
How's Mario RPG? Um, I am always suffering.

1665
03:12:07,720 --> 03:12:18,720
Wait. Shit.

1666
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:25,720
Attack! Fuck!

1667
03:12:25,720 --> 03:12:33,720
I didn't turn into a mushroom!

1668
03:12:33,720 --> 03:12:46,720
The pet's in there.

1669
03:12:46,720 --> 03:13:00,720
You recover? Not for long!

1670
03:13:01,720 --> 03:13:10,720
Flower! Oops, I meant flower, no?

1671
03:13:10,720 --> 03:13:20,720
Oops.

1672
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:26,720
I hit the wrong button, that was my bad.

1673
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:34,720
Oi. Oi.

1674
03:13:34,720 --> 03:13:40,720
In the last! Woo!

1675
03:13:40,720 --> 03:13:47,720
Get shroomed! The way there's no shrooms here.

1676
03:13:47,720 --> 03:13:55,720
Die. Stingy flowers.

1677
03:13:55,720 --> 03:14:16,720
How dare you recover! Better not be a Conti flower when I get back. It seems to be a Conti flower.

1678
03:14:16,720 --> 03:14:29,720
Should I start putting things into attack, into magic now? Or should it just all be attack?

1679
03:14:29,720 --> 03:14:41,720
Attack. Magic!

1680
03:14:46,720 --> 03:15:15,720
Yeah! Oh, that's cute. You know, get to level up. You get your magic.

1681
03:15:16,720 --> 03:15:36,720
Okay, I guess it's over here, huh? What do I have to do here? Do I sneak by them?

1682
03:15:36,720 --> 03:15:49,720
It looks like you're having a good time.

1683
03:15:49,720 --> 03:15:53,720
What do I do? Am I supposed to fight them?

1684
03:15:53,720 --> 03:16:04,720
Crippid!

1685
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:12,720
I need more maple syrup.

1686
03:16:12,720 --> 03:16:35,720
Wait, shit.

1687
03:16:35,720 --> 03:16:45,720
Man. Okay, it's awake now.

1688
03:16:46,720 --> 03:17:09,720
No, Gino, last them!

1689
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:16,720
Oh, shit. EW!

1690
03:17:16,720 --> 03:17:24,720
And now the way it moved is almost so gross!

1691
03:17:39,720 --> 03:17:51,720
EW!

1692
03:17:51,720 --> 03:18:00,720
Gross.

1693
03:18:09,720 --> 03:18:29,720
Yo, yo, yo, girl! Disgusting, disgusting, the way you move is gross!

1694
03:18:29,720 --> 03:18:57,720
Let's just kill it like this. They're really cute like this. Wee! Look how cute they are! Look at the star!

1695
03:18:58,720 --> 03:19:16,720
Really? I did nothing?

1696
03:19:16,720 --> 03:19:22,720
Oh, thank goodness.

1697
03:19:22,720 --> 03:19:46,720
Friendship is not strong enough. What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to wait for all these? Oh, I can enter it.

1698
03:19:46,720 --> 03:19:59,720
Oh, I got something.

1699
03:20:00,720 --> 03:20:21,720
Guess I fight all of them.

1700
03:20:21,720 --> 03:20:34,720
Okay, good thing that's normal then.

1701
03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:48,720
What the hell?

1702
03:20:48,720 --> 03:20:53,720
Oh, it's fast, at least.

1703
03:20:53,720 --> 03:21:02,720
Yo, beach!

1704
03:21:02,720 --> 03:21:23,720
I'm gonna just kill all of them.

1705
03:21:23,720 --> 03:21:51,720
Oh, frog coin! Yay!

1706
03:21:51,720 --> 03:21:55,720
Now you're okay!

1707
03:21:55,720 --> 03:22:06,720
Okay, now what's this?

1708
03:22:06,720 --> 03:22:11,720
Did that give me cool stuff?

1709
03:22:11,720 --> 03:22:15,720
Oh, well, that was quick.

1710
03:22:15,720 --> 03:22:23,720
Is there anything here? It's not cool?

1711
03:22:23,720 --> 03:22:32,720
Easy money, okay. Come on, start flowering! Just start watering! I need to kill some bitches!

1712
03:22:45,720 --> 03:23:00,720
Come on, start watering! Just watering! Water!

1713
03:23:00,720 --> 03:23:18,720
Wait, I need to go in here.

1714
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:31,720
Is this name please, no? That's so cute.

1715
03:23:31,720 --> 03:23:46,720
What the hell is that? Genie was inside?

1716
03:23:46,720 --> 03:23:54,720
Well, power friendship, hopefully. No, no power friendship. Actually, switch you out.

1717
03:23:54,720 --> 03:24:16,720
I want the power of not friendship!

1718
03:24:16,720 --> 03:24:26,720
Another one! Well, that was kind of rude, wasn't it?

1719
03:24:46,720 --> 03:25:15,720
Okay, better fucking level up a lot! Oh, I got like 150 coins though. Yay! Coins!

1720
03:25:15,720 --> 03:25:32,720
Okay, now start watering!

1721
03:25:32,720 --> 03:26:00,720
Start watering!

1722
03:26:00,720 --> 03:26:25,720
I don't want that flower thing to move, it's disgusting the way it moves.

1723
03:26:25,720 --> 03:26:51,720
Oh! Fuck you!

1724
03:26:51,720 --> 03:27:19,720
Ah, fuck!

1725
03:27:19,720 --> 03:27:29,720
Come on, Peach, start reviving things!

1726
03:28:20,720 --> 03:28:40,720
Ah!

1727
03:28:40,720 --> 03:28:55,720
Why is this taking so damn long?

1728
03:28:55,720 --> 03:29:15,720
Oh, come on, I don't have anything!

1729
03:29:15,720 --> 03:29:25,720
Can I switch him with a dead body?

1730
03:30:15,720 --> 03:30:25,720
Oh shit, I forgot to use the thing!

1731
03:30:45,720 --> 03:31:14,720
Wow!

1732
03:31:14,720 --> 03:31:24,720
I need therapy!

1733
03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:44,720
That's so fucking rude though.

1734
03:31:44,720 --> 03:32:12,720
Ah, fuck you!

1735
03:32:14,720 --> 03:32:43,720
Okay, if I move.

1736
03:32:45,720 --> 03:32:53,720
Yeah!

1737
03:32:53,720 --> 03:33:08,720
Oh, these guys!

1738
03:33:08,720 --> 03:33:22,720
I like this thing.

1739
03:33:22,720 --> 03:33:35,720
Okay, Mario!

1740
03:33:35,720 --> 03:33:44,720
Ooh, stop! Yeah!

1741
03:34:05,720 --> 03:34:33,720
What?

1742
03:34:33,720 --> 03:34:42,720
Yay! Magic!

1743
03:34:42,720 --> 03:34:46,720
Magic!

1744
03:34:46,720 --> 03:34:53,720
Look at all them, like, leveling up! I think that's one good thing.

1745
03:34:53,720 --> 03:35:16,720
Okay, last one!

1746
03:35:23,720 --> 03:35:29,720
Yeah! Fuck yeah!

1747
03:35:29,720 --> 03:35:42,720
Oh look, I got watered!

1748
03:35:42,720 --> 03:35:49,720
Yay! I got a frog coin!

1749
03:35:49,720 --> 03:35:58,720
Look at that, I defeated everything!

1750
03:35:58,720 --> 03:36:20,720
We are now super strong! Get over here!

1751
03:36:21,720 --> 03:36:25,720
There's more!

1752
03:36:25,720 --> 03:36:28,720
It's shower time!

1753
03:36:28,720 --> 03:36:31,720
There they are, my pretties!

1754
03:36:31,720 --> 03:36:36,720
Oh, dolly-dum!

1755
03:36:36,720 --> 03:36:49,720
There's two of them now.

1756
03:36:49,720 --> 03:36:58,720
There they are, my pretties!

1757
03:36:58,720 --> 03:37:08,720
Oh, dolly-dum!

1758
03:37:29,720 --> 03:37:36,720
Lottie doll, really?

1759
03:37:36,720 --> 03:37:38,720
And some nutrients!

1760
03:37:38,720 --> 03:37:57,720
There they are, my pretties!

1761
03:37:57,720 --> 03:38:04,720
Phew!

1762
03:38:04,720 --> 03:38:08,720
Oh, I turned into mushroom!

1763
03:38:08,720 --> 03:38:18,720
I'm in here!

1764
03:38:38,720 --> 03:38:59,720
Wow!

1765
03:38:59,720 --> 03:39:02,720
Where's mine?

1766
03:39:02,720 --> 03:39:05,720
Oh shit.

1767
03:39:06,720 --> 03:39:25,720
Oh, hi! Can you do anything?

1768
03:39:25,720 --> 03:39:30,720
Yeah!

1769
03:39:30,720 --> 03:39:35,720
What you did?

1770
03:39:35,720 --> 03:39:39,720
Oh, I'm gonna get it!

1771
03:39:39,720 --> 03:39:43,720
Queen Valentina told me to keep everyone out of Nimbus Land!

1772
03:39:43,720 --> 03:39:45,720
Should I do?

1773
03:39:45,720 --> 03:39:52,720
I know, I'll run away!

1774
03:39:52,720 --> 03:39:57,720
What's this? The seed, take it.

1775
03:39:57,720 --> 03:40:06,720
Pick up the seed.

1776
03:40:06,720 --> 03:40:14,720
What's this?

1777
03:40:14,720 --> 03:40:18,720
Is this like, you know...

1778
03:40:18,720 --> 03:40:20,720
Oh, did you see that? It's like a magical beanstalk!

1779
03:40:20,720 --> 03:40:23,720
Get the block one more time to climb it!

1780
03:40:23,720 --> 03:40:31,720
Yeah, like, jack-in-the-beanstalk, okay.

1781
03:40:31,720 --> 03:40:41,720
Whee!

1782
03:40:41,720 --> 03:40:43,720
How to climb vines.

1783
03:40:43,720 --> 03:40:45,720
Climb and circle around the vines with L.

1784
03:40:45,720 --> 03:40:50,720
Jump to another vine by tilting L in the direction you want to go and pressing V.

1785
03:40:50,720 --> 03:40:55,720
The shadow below as your guide, Nimbus Department of Transportation.

1786
03:40:55,720 --> 03:40:58,720
Can I talk to this? No.

1787
03:40:58,720 --> 03:41:03,720
Talking not an option.

1788
03:41:03,720 --> 03:41:07,720
Look at the big chonker!

1789
03:41:07,720 --> 03:41:12,720
Fuck.

1790
03:41:21,720 --> 03:41:27,720
You guys ready to launch?

1791
03:41:27,720 --> 03:41:32,720
He's so cute!

1792
03:41:32,720 --> 03:41:40,720
Does he do, like, really big damage, though?

1793
03:41:50,720 --> 03:42:00,720
Oh, what was it again?

1794
03:42:00,720 --> 03:42:10,720

Kind of want that though whatever that was

Dear me

1927
04:01:38,760 --> 04:01:42,760

Observe the thick moustache with it. I depict his kind feelings for his younger brother

2015
04:09:52,440 --> 04:09:54,760
And the sideburns conveying his strength of heart

2016
04:09:56,920 --> 04:10:00,920
The legs well defined strong legs that can leap any distance in a single bound

2017
04:10:01,640 --> 04:10:03,640
to your liking

2018
04:10:04,120 --> 04:10:09,640

04:21:03,480 --> 04:21:06,120
A bunch of my friends have been like oh my gosh

2103
04:21:07,560 --> 04:21:13,640
Congrats on the new job. We haven't seen you in forever. Let's hang out and I figured

2104
04:21:14,200 --> 04:21:18,280
Now would be a great time since I haven't really had a vacation in a while

2105
04:21:21,000 --> 04:21:23,800
I haven't had a vacation in a while and so

2106
04:21:25,640 --> 04:21:32,120
I think uh, we're just heading out heading out. Um, maybe I think we might be going camping

2107
04:21:33,240 --> 04:21:38,440
I'm not sure. I'm leaving the itinerary to my friends to the girls

2108
04:21:38,680 --> 04:21:40,680
Ha ha

2109
04:21:42,200 --> 04:21:44,200
So, whoa, whoa

2110
04:21:44,200 --> 04:21:52,200
I'll I'll come back and see my supplies after my little recoup your recuperation period

2111
04:21:56,120 --> 04:21:59,720
So that's from the 8th to 14th

2112
04:22:00,440 --> 04:22:02,440
Mm-hmm

2113
04:22:04,120 --> 04:22:07,160
So the itinerary is up to them, so we'll do it and then

2114
04:22:07,960 --> 04:22:13,000
Yeah, hopefully I'll have the energy a lot of energy tomorrow. I am streaming

2115
04:22:13,640 --> 04:22:17,720
As I said like today I streamed an hour earlier than I usually do

2116
04:22:18,840 --> 04:22:20,840
Because I made a mistake on my schedule

2117
04:22:21,480 --> 04:22:29,080
And I think that next week was I I actually haven't had enough time to to test out this this time

2118
04:22:29,720 --> 04:22:31,720
So I want to see if

2119
04:22:32,040 --> 04:22:34,040
Uh, we'll test this time

2120
04:22:34,520 --> 04:22:38,040
Onto into the next week as well. And if it works out great

2121
04:22:38,440 --> 04:22:44,600
This will be our regular time if it doesn't really work out if I feel more exhausted or I feel like it's not really good

2122
04:22:45,320 --> 04:22:46,440
um

2123
04:22:46,440 --> 04:22:48,440
I'll

2124
04:22:48,520 --> 04:22:49,800
I'll

2125
04:22:49,800 --> 04:22:53,000
Move it back to the old one first impressions on this time slot

2126
04:22:53,960 --> 04:22:55,960
Because it's an hour

2127
04:22:55,960 --> 04:22:57,080
earlier

2128
04:22:57,080 --> 04:22:59,080
I have to get home earlier

2129
04:22:59,480 --> 04:23:01,480
Then I then I

2130
04:23:01,480 --> 04:23:03,980
Expected so it makes me feel a little rushed

2131
04:23:05,240 --> 04:23:07,880
Makes me feel tiny bit itty bitty a little rush

2132
04:23:08,520 --> 04:23:10,520
But it's still pretty late

2133
04:23:11,720 --> 04:23:16,680
It's still pretty late, so it's not too bad, but you know like a nine. You're just like oh well

2134
04:23:19,560 --> 04:23:21,560
No rush I can just get home

2135
04:23:21,720 --> 04:23:24,760
Right, but now it's a little bit a little bit like of a rush

2136
04:23:24,840 --> 04:23:28,040
But I feel like a lot of people can catch me catch me more

2137
04:23:28,680 --> 04:23:29,800
but

2138
04:23:29,800 --> 04:23:31,800
We'll see we'll see we'll see

2139
04:23:32,200 --> 04:23:34,200
Senpai

2140
04:23:34,520 --> 04:23:36,520
Thank you

2141
04:23:36,680 --> 04:23:38,680
Omadon for the

2142
04:23:39,960 --> 04:23:45,880
669 or 10 a that australian doors noise wait

2143
04:23:46,520 --> 04:23:48,520
noise

2144
04:23:48,520 --> 04:23:52,200
My lunch money for senpai. Thank you for your lunch money

2145
04:23:58,920 --> 04:24:01,400
Maybe we can find the middle ground whatever works best for you

2146
04:24:01,480 --> 04:24:08,840
I feel like if starting on the hour makes people more aware of this get more aware of the schedule unwilling to

2147
04:24:09,800 --> 04:24:15,000
To make a little bit more time, but yeah, uh this week was my mistake. I uh

2148
04:24:16,120 --> 04:24:18,120
I put it in the wrong

2149
04:24:18,760 --> 04:24:20,760
Wrong

2150
04:24:21,160 --> 04:24:23,160
Wrong time slot so

2151
04:24:24,120 --> 04:24:31,560
So that was my my bad my bad, but we're gonna test it out so far. I feel like senpais are a bit happier

2152
04:24:33,320 --> 04:24:36,440
You like senpais are a bit happier, so that's real good

2153
04:24:38,040 --> 04:24:44,120
That's really good. I'm so sorry. I had to cut this short. I did agree to be like yeah, I'll do yoga

2154
04:24:45,640 --> 04:24:47,640
Early in the morning

2155
04:24:48,600 --> 04:24:56,440
But yeah, uh, we'll continue wild arms and mario rpg as well in the upcoming week

2156
04:24:56,520 --> 04:24:58,520
That's not on the schedule, but it will be there

2157
04:24:59,640 --> 04:25:01,640
Uh

2158
04:25:02,200 --> 04:25:09,480
Anything else to say, uh, uh for light comers. I am now

2159
04:25:09,960 --> 04:25:17,080
Uh anything else to say, uh, uh for light comers. I am now

2160
04:25:19,880 --> 04:25:22,680
Uh, what's the word I have a code

2161
04:25:23,800 --> 04:25:28,040
For gamer subs use mercy for 10 off your gamer subs order

2162
04:25:31,080 --> 04:25:35,400
If you use my code a lot we might be able to get

2163
04:25:35,960 --> 04:25:40,360
You might be able to get my few cups and maybe a flavor

2164
04:25:48,920 --> 04:25:57,480
So that is that is where but we're at remember to use game resets code six times because all

2165
04:25:59,960 --> 04:26:01,960
Because all of the uh

2166
04:26:02,440 --> 04:26:05,720
All of the girls from vealer have

2167
04:26:07,560 --> 04:26:12,600
Have codes so remember to order six times and use the code six times

2168
04:26:17,240 --> 04:26:25,160
I actually never tried a um a powdered energy drink before so but uh

2169
04:26:25,720 --> 04:26:32,520
My my gen mates management and strawney say it's pretty good. It's pretty good

2170
04:26:38,680 --> 04:26:44,840
I heard it's pretty good. I I don't really drink energy drinks. I I've had like a monster here and there

2171
04:26:45,400 --> 04:26:46,360
but

2172
04:26:46,360 --> 04:26:50,280
This would be my first time trying like a powdered one. So I'll see how it goes

2173
04:26:50,680 --> 04:26:57,400
Uh, I got kindly sent a pr package. So maybe there's a hand cam in the future

2174
04:27:02,680 --> 04:27:04,680
Maybe

2175
04:27:08,120 --> 04:27:10,680
I I I don't really drink energy drinks. So

2176
04:27:11,640 --> 04:27:13,640
I'm I'm hoping I'm hoping that

2177
04:27:14,280 --> 04:27:19,560
That maybe I'll I'll really like it. They sent me three interesting flavors. I'd like to try it out

2178
04:27:20,760 --> 04:27:22,760
So

2179
04:27:26,920 --> 04:27:32,120
I like the raid's d sound when you say colds because it sounds like colds wait

2180
04:27:33,720 --> 04:27:36,840
Wait, do I say it like that? Wait

2181
04:27:39,400 --> 04:27:44,600
Wait a second. Wait. Wait now. I'm getting so conscious about the way I say things

2182
04:27:45,240 --> 04:27:47,240
cold

2183
04:27:47,400 --> 04:27:49,400
cold

2184
04:27:49,720 --> 04:27:51,720
cold

2185
04:27:52,200 --> 04:27:54,200
Cold

2186
04:27:54,680 --> 04:27:57,800
Now I'm getting self conscious about it. No

2187
04:28:05,960 --> 04:28:07,960
No

2188
04:28:10,600 --> 04:28:12,600
No

2189
04:28:13,480 --> 04:28:15,480
Sometimes

2190
04:28:15,880 --> 04:28:27,080
Sometimes sometimes I'm uh, I say things I say things a little funny. I say things a little funny. It's okay

2191
04:28:32,360 --> 04:28:40,520
I can't believe it. I can't believe I'm getting getting caught caught saying funny saying things in funny ways

2192
04:28:41,480 --> 04:28:43,480
Ha

2193
04:28:45,080 --> 04:28:47,960
Don't worry same ish. I struggle with the word perseverance

2194
04:28:49,560 --> 04:28:54,200
Perseverance perseverance perseverance perseverance

2195
04:28:57,880 --> 04:29:01,000
Perseverance, I think I say that normally

2196
04:29:03,800 --> 04:29:07,000
I know there's some things that people are like, oh you can't say that funny

2197
04:29:07,960 --> 04:29:13,800
And I'm just like no no you're lying to me say mountain

2198
04:29:16,040 --> 04:29:18,040
Mountain

2199
04:29:25,320 --> 04:29:31,640
English is my fourth language. That's why I was able to catch it. Wow. Don't clock my accent

2200
04:29:37,800 --> 04:29:43,320
Ha, that's really impressive though. Congratulations on learning four languages. I only know

2201
04:29:49,560 --> 04:29:51,560
Two and a half

2202
04:29:52,920 --> 04:29:58,520
No, it's more like one and two of them are are like a half and like a quarter

2203
04:29:59,560 --> 04:30:01,560
Now say wash your shots

2204
04:30:07,320 --> 04:30:14,520
What's the half the first half is Vietnamese

2205
04:30:17,720 --> 04:30:19,720
The second one is

2206
04:30:20,120 --> 04:30:22,120
Like the quarter one is like Japanese

2207
04:30:22,760 --> 04:30:25,000
And like there's like one that's like itty-bitty

2208
04:30:25,640 --> 04:30:27,240
tiny tiny

2209
04:30:27,240 --> 04:30:31,400
Like not even super impressive at all is like french

2210
04:30:37,240 --> 04:30:43,000
Which I am I have like such, uh, such, uh, what do you call it? Um

2211
04:30:46,440 --> 04:30:51,640
Precious like understanding a french. What words do you know in french?

2212
04:30:58,920 --> 04:31:04,600
Not enough to like speak it but enough to like be like I can read that

2213
04:31:07,000 --> 04:31:09,000
Yeah

2214
04:31:22,680 --> 04:31:24,680
I'm let do from hush

2215
04:31:26,920 --> 04:31:28,920
Well, hi, can you say wolf

2216
04:31:29,720 --> 04:31:37,880
Like regular wolf or like in french

2217
04:31:43,960 --> 04:31:45,960
It's probably not

2218
04:31:47,800 --> 04:31:52,040
I don't think I know it in french. I like I said, I know like a facetious

2219
04:31:53,080 --> 04:31:56,840
I know I'm from my french teacher was this formula bush like shut your mouth

2220
04:31:59,880 --> 04:32:03,320
Have her neck is very cool back thing french french never use it, right?

2221
04:32:05,880 --> 04:32:09,480
Right, which is why I'm just like yeah, it's like the facetious like

2222
04:32:11,560 --> 04:32:13,560
Um

2223
04:32:15,640 --> 04:32:17,640
Wait facetious is like fake

2224
04:32:19,240 --> 04:32:22,280
Hold on. Let's look at the facetious

2225
04:32:22,280 --> 04:32:28,440
facetious treating serious issues with deliberately inappropriate humor are flippant

2226
04:32:30,920 --> 04:32:33,560
Isn't tavernak and it started something it's like saying shit

2227
04:32:36,120 --> 04:32:38,120
Or fuck

2228
04:32:46,520 --> 04:32:48,520
So that's your word of the day

2229
04:32:52,920 --> 04:32:57,480
It's called hi very flippant. I wouldn't know if I would call myself flippant

2230
04:33:09,880 --> 04:33:13,080
I wouldn't call myself flippant probably not

2231
04:33:13,640 --> 04:33:25,080
But I would say like my my my uh

2232
04:33:27,000 --> 04:33:29,000
Knowledge of languages is not that great

2233
04:33:31,880 --> 04:33:37,080
Like so so so very tiny. I don't even think it would count as learning a language, right?

2234
04:33:38,440 --> 04:33:42,120
Or knowing a language it would be count as like, you know some words and that's it

2235
04:33:43,800 --> 04:33:45,800
I

2236
04:33:51,480 --> 04:33:53,160
Think uh

2237
04:33:53,160 --> 04:33:57,560
Yeah, I really greatly respect people who know a lot of languages. I have trouble learning languages

2238
04:33:58,360 --> 04:33:59,640
um

2239
04:33:59,640 --> 04:34:04,840
But learning languages is a little easier when you're surrounded by people in that language

2240
04:34:05,400 --> 04:34:08,520
And therefore you can speak you can speak it at any time

2241
04:34:13,880 --> 04:34:21,080
You can understand English outside of American accents at least right but I understand sort of sort of

2242
04:34:22,280 --> 04:34:25,880
If if it's like really really heavy slang

2243
04:34:27,320 --> 04:34:31,080
I might I might have trouble I might have trouble if it's uh

2244
04:34:34,440 --> 04:34:39,800
Uh if it's like really heavy slang like if

2245
04:34:40,680 --> 04:34:46,920
If you know people start saying saying weird things

2246
04:34:52,520 --> 04:34:54,680
The ant translate about newfoundland slang

2247
04:34:56,920 --> 04:35:00,760
Oh, she's all there. She got a couple wheels on her. Yeah

2248
04:35:00,760 --> 04:35:02,760
Ha ha ha ha ha

2249
04:35:06,680 --> 04:35:13,640
Other than coli coli coli coli coli coli will comes you understand stronti, right? Yeah. Yeah, I understand stronti quite well

2250
04:35:18,760 --> 04:35:20,760
Can you say

2251
04:35:23,880 --> 04:35:26,360
What the fuck did I just say am I gonna get banned?

2252
04:35:27,320 --> 04:35:33,880

Yeah, I didn't say anything weird, right?

2257
04:36:02,760 --> 04:36:07,480
I didn't say anything weird that's a bannable offense, right? I'm gonna get bonked, right?

2258
04:36:14,200 --> 04:36:19,000
My accent is probably really bad. I mean my accent in all languages is pretty bad

2259
04:36:27,080 --> 04:36:29,080
Like

2260
04:36:29,960 --> 04:36:31,400
I think

2261
04:36:31,400 --> 04:36:35,320
My accent in vietnamese is very much very foreigner like

2262
04:36:36,120 --> 04:36:38,600
and my accent in japanese is very

2263
04:36:39,560 --> 04:36:40,360
also

2264
04:36:40,360 --> 04:36:42,360
foreigner like

2265
04:36:43,400 --> 04:36:47,720
It's cuter though slightly cuter. I don't know why I say where's the japanese slightly cuter

2266
04:36:48,440 --> 04:36:50,440
Hahaha

2267
04:36:55,960 --> 04:36:57,560
Slightly

2268
04:36:57,560 --> 04:37:00,280
Because I'm always cute wink. Wait. Anyways
