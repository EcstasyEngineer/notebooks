450000	480000	Call Hiyoooo Allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
480000	485520	too much to the right? Should I move over? I feel like I should move over.
485520	487520	Nah, maybe I'll walk too much up the screen.
496000	496960	I'll make myself bigger.
500160	502800	I'll make myself bigger. Why do I have two of these open?
504400	505680	One of these has to go.
506560	510640	One of these things is not like the other.
511920	513760	One of these things made me lose tracking.
521920	527680	Wow, I had everything so ready some pie and now I'm being a klutz.
535680	543680	It's like you can still hear my voice.
544960	550160	Okay, anyways, whoa, whoa, whoa, welcome senpai. Welcome to the screen. Welcome to Deathmark again.
550800	558000	I have good news. My rash has gone so much down, got down so much.
558560	564320	Yesterday I was like, it looks like my arm again and not some and not like him.
565680	573600	Let me grab my controller. I'm so not ready for this.
577760	583600	What happened and how? I don't know. I literally, I think it was my bed sheets.
583600	591920	I put them in the wash and then I put them back onto my bed and then like overnight it got like X,
591920	596160	like super better. I was like, thank you.
604640	611520	But I'm so happy. Oh, and thank you Griffith for the 10 members. I hope everyone enjoys the memberships.
613520	617760	Evil bed sheets, right? How long did you have those bed sheets?
618000	622320	Oh, five, half a year now.
624800	629920	Did stress play a role in your rash? Probably, 100% probably.
633920	642240	Like it's, I don't know, maybe, maybe I like went to bed with, I don't know, something or maybe
642240	648000	mama, mama or papa was cleaning up in there and they had like, I don't know, stuff on them.
648000	653200	Who knows? How often do you wash them? Washing? What does that mean?
653200	655200	I don't know.
669760	673760	Forget about it. Forget about it. You don't need to wash shades?
675760	678880	I learned my lesson. No worry. Let me move over here a little bit. Yeah, we go.
683200	692720	Oh, but like those are actually new bed sheets. I don't know what happened, but they were new and I've been like using them for
693600	702560	um, like maybe, maybe a few months, like half a year now and nothing happened. And then suddenly I was just like, oh, I'm allergic.
703520	717120	And then, oh, so today I walked around the, I walked around the neighborhood and then I had, I had a thought, the, does, does
718400	721520	senpai's play ping pong because I'm palm?
726800	728800	Question, is that the reason?
732800	734800	It is now.
744320	747760	I withhold my answer. Oh, senpai's naughty.
749760	754800	Kohai, what did you have for dinner today? I had a ham and cheese sandwich.
757600	759600	This morning I had pho.
763520	774960	I didn't see anything. You didn't play anything at all. Oh, yeah, not anything at all. Not that I see the paddles everywhere or the nets hidden under one of your beds.
774960	784240	I know everything I see. Oh, this, my, this bang hides my third eye. That hides the Gigan eye.
793520	802160	What bed? The doggie bed! The doggie bed in the haze!
807360	811920	You get doggie beds. I put a little stuffed animal in there. It's a little pillow.
823360	834000	Excuse me. It's starting to get really cold, so I'm being affected by the weather.
842160	850240	But um, as a warning though, my arm still heats up even though the rash is like pretty much like really,
851120	854720	it's still like 40% still there. Tea check?
856480	861200	Today's tea is pomegranate green tea. I wanted to stay awake for senpai's.
862080	864080	We would never lie to our precious Kohai.
864800	866800	Says a liar.
869920	878160	Word of the day, um, contingency. Like a plan. Like, what you,
878160	888080	what senpai's need? A contingency plan.
909040	912480	Okay, let's talk to the people.
917920	925040	Also, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about yesterday. I put the days wrong.
927840	931600	Do you know what mama and papa always say to me?
931600	939280	They always go, merci! You're so clumsy. Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.
945120	947040	Mama, mama always gets mad at me.
948560	954080	Because when I have a button-up shirt or like a cardigan, I always miss one button. So the,
954080	956880	so it's like, the buttons are always wrong.
962000	974080	So I was like, oh, so when I told them like, yeah, I made the days wrong. So I have to go down and
974080	982160	tell, tell everyone that, that it's the wrong day. They're like, of course, of course you did.
982160	993440	I spent the day looking for a matching alchemy model, kid. Oh,
993440	996720	is the senpai's want to have a matching alchemy model?
999520	1003600	Yeah, it's, it's, it's a really, it's really fast. I built it in like,
1004240	1008000	maybe 10 minutes, maybe less than that, five minutes. I suffered the one time where I made a
1008000	1012720	mistake and then I had to poke, poke one in the mouth again because I forgot to put the strawberry in.
1016640	1022000	But I really like alchemy. It was like my first, when I was playing Pokemon
1022560	1027120	Sword and Shield. Oh, which one do I have? I think I have Shield. Yeah. Um,
1028640	1035680	oh, when I have Sword and, Sword and Shield, it was the first Gigantamax Pokemon I got.
1035680	1037280	So I was like, yeah.
1043440	1048320	What's your favorite alchemy variation? The original one, because that's the one I got.
1049520	1058960	My alchemy is named Milfyu after the Galaxy Angel character. If you know Galaxy Angel.
1059280	1069600	The key to the spirit's grudge. It should be within each elementary. Oh, sorry, I was supposed to do voices.
1073200	1079920	It should be within each elementary. Fate has tied him to that school. However, even I do not
1080560	1082080	know what form it will take.
1082800	1088160	My favorite Pokemon is Mimikyu.
1091280	1098080	Mimikyu is a, is a dangerous Pokemon. I really liked Galaxy Angel because it was the first
1098960	1103680	DVD I ever had for like an anime series.
1104080	1123280	Hey, wait, Mashita appears as we're getting ready to leave. Bad news.
1123600	1138560	Oh, my favorite Pokemon used to be Vaporeon until, until the copy pasta. And then I, I had a less
1138560	1142880	respect. I had a less liking to Vaporeon.
1143280	1158400	But I, I can tell you mama and papa's favorite Pokemon, mama's favorite Pokemon is a Lapras.
1158400	1165120	Which I, I don't know about you senpai, but I feel like Lapras is a very mommy Pokemon.
1165120	1171920	So when she chose that, I was like, oh, somehow this is so, this is very suitable for you,
1171920	1183040	mommy. And papa and my sister's favorite is Snorlax.
1192240	1195040	But yeah, when mama, mama picked Lapras, I was like,
1195440	1201840	ah, this is, this is like a very, this is very suitable for mama.
1210080	1216320	But like, they also really like Pikachu. I think that's the only one they actually know the name of.
1216320	1226880	It's the only one they actually know the name of. But like, if I gave them like a picture of like
1226880	1231600	Pokemons, mama picked out Lapras and she was like, yeah, this one's my favorite.
1232240	1236240	And papa picked out Snorlax and my sister also was like, I like Snorlax.
1236880	1242720	Imagine if papa chose Vaporeon.
1245760	1250320	Even if he did, I would not tell senpais. I would not tell senpais, but he did it.
1256880	1261360	That high school girl. It's Molly, it's gone.
1261360	1264800	Damn.
1270480	1272960	At least she's nowhere in the mansion.
1275920	1280080	Speaking of which, I didn't see her when we were talking to Mary in the hall either.
1283520	1287520	Maybe she ran away. That doesn't make sense.
1288400	1291280	What would she accomplish by doing that?
1293200	1296080	Running away from the mansion won't make her mark disappear.
1298800	1302960	It could be her form of escape. Many kill themselves if they know they're gonna die.
1304480	1308400	Okay, okay, Mr. Detective Guy.
1308400	1318160	I maybe something happened to her like the spirit's curse.
1321360	1326720	Molly saw Hannah Hickel in the mirror at the school. So she's the mark bearer with the strongest
1326720	1335520	connection. It's possible that he zeroed in on her just like Tsukasa said. But there's nothing we can do.
1338560	1343520	Let's get ready to go. Yeah, we really can't do anything right now.
1344480	1350080	Even if something happened to Molly, if we can get the mark to vanish, I should save her too.
1351760	1355040	Let's head out. We're going back to H Elementary.
1358720	1365520	Let's go back, senpai. Back to the beginning. Does anyone get that reference? Come on.
1368720	1382720	Yeah, yeah, this is your mom movie. You come back to H Elementary.
1387120	1390720	Senpais are so smart. I'm so proud of Senpai.
1392880	1396720	I knew for a while that in the end this place is just a school.
1396720	1402800	Well, an abandoned school with a monster in it. And you know, the security card probably just died.
1407040	1413440	Oh yeah, and there's like killer plants in there. Oh, and a bunch of poisonous snakes. So not exactly normal.
1420640	1425760	Let's go. Tsukasa nods silently and steps forward.
1427120	1429280	Wait, did I go with the kid?
1434240	1440320	Oh yeah, I went with the kid because I was like, oh well, adults, they'll fucking die, right?
1442480	1443280	Okay, let's go in.
1447440	1449120	Okay, let's see. Examine.
1450720	1455280	Anything new? What's in the shoe locker? The battered shoe rack is covered in dirt.
1456960	1463360	Okay, disintegrated stuff. Okay, okay. I want to go to the left this time.
1468560	1476480	We saw it earlier, but look at all these flowers. Roses are red, violets are blue.
1477040	1488960	We saw it. The hallway has completely transformed. Seeing them like this.
1492000	1496160	Are roses on that pretty? When you look close, they're scary.
1496160	1499840	Huh? Uh-huh. What's that?
1500960	1503360	Tsukasa suddenly speaks up. There.
1504400	1507600	By the window. Hey, over there, something's sparkling.
1509760	1513440	The window? I see her rose vines. I may as well check it out though.
1516400	1522640	Oh, there it is. Something's glinting over by the window.
1523360	1527920	Looks like something's buried in the rose vines. It's definitely something there.
1530240	1531280	Sorry, I'm coughing.
1536080	1540320	I didn't notice it before. No, maybe it wasn't there yet when we passed through here earlier.
1541440	1547360	A guard from before. Did he drop that? Maybe. He might have fallen on the floor and been
1547360	1553760	lifted up by the vines. It's only now that it's high enough to be spotted.
1554960	1558400	If it belonged to the guard, then it could come in handy while we're investigating.
1559200	1563040	He's in charge of watching this building after all. Let's check it out.
1565440	1572400	Feel it. Oh, what if I cut myself though? I pushed my fingers into the vines. Ow!
1573360	1577120	I was careful, but oddly shaped thorns still cut my skin.
1577760	1583680	Damn, this is a pain. I keep fighting with the vines. I finally reached the metal object.
1584560	1592000	Got school curing! Yeah, make sure to hydrate. Okay. It is a little cold here, Senpai.
1592480	1604880	So, I might, I might be coughing because it's cold. It's been raining a lot.
1608320	1611520	Yep, just as we thought. These definitely belong to the guards.
1613040	1615600	These would be extremely useful. You can get into places we...
1616640	1620240	The castle suddenly cuts off mid-sentence. What's wrong?
1621200	1625680	Nothing. I just forgot what I was saying. Anyway, let's keep looking around.
1627280	1631360	Need info was added to spirit file. Continued investigation of the school.
1633360	1637360	Huh.
1637520	1644720	Maybe... I know that the kid doesn't like an adult, but I feel so uncomfortable bringing your kid around.
1645360	1650480	You know? I feel so uncomfortable bringing a tiny tot.
1652080	1655920	A tiny tot around with me. Maybe I should go back and grab the guy?
1661840	1663600	I'm gonna go back and grab the guy.
1664320	1675360	Maybe he should stay with the creepy doll girl.
1678000	1680400	I don't know. I'm just like...
1681840	1689040	Also, you know, kids are very... I don't know. I feel like the detective might have a gun,
1689040	1694800	and that might come in handy. But also... Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna go back.
1696960	1697680	I'm gonna go back.
1701920	1706320	Don't fucking do that. Don't fucking do that, gay. I hate kids.
1708480	1711680	I mean, kid's laughter. Stranny!
1719600	1724480	Eyeball. Let's take...
1727840	1731920	Stranny raid! Welcome, Stranny! Welcome to the stream! Welcome raiders! How was...
1732880	1738720	the hat game... link... the hat game? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
1740480	1743040	I was watching a bit of it, and I was like, oh, it's so cute!
1743120	1749840	Turns out, I'm MLG on Zelda and did the boss first time. Nice!
1751520	1755760	Well, welcome, everyone. Today, I am playing Deathmark.
1758480	1764800	It's a visual novel, horror-ish game with quick time events and
1767120	1771200	choices and some movements. So, if you like this,
1771520	1773280	let's play.
1776320	1781840	Okay, now we'll return to HLM entry, because I'm just like, I don't know! I don't like bringing a kid
1781840	1791440	with me! There you go. Spooky spooky. Okay, all in favor to go left? I'm going left.
1791440	1805680	Okay, I use the school key ring and open the door. Yeah! Son of a bitch!
1822160	1834640	This is why we're like, I don't like kids, generally.
1836880	1842640	Did that get a senpai's? Child jumpscare.
1845840	1849520	Did that get senpai's too? Because my heart dropped for a second.
1852000	1856160	Okay, let's, uh, look.
1865360	1869040	The aluminum chalk case has dents all over it, as if something hit it.
1870720	1872960	Eel. Something's inside the chalk case.
1874160	1879280	Found a worn-out talisman, and I pick up the worn-out talisman. I feel warmth flow through me!
1882400	1890160	My heart died for a moment. I got used to it. I was like, ah, I forgot the jump scares.
1890880	1896000	Got soap power. Yeah, the worn-out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.
1896880	1901200	Let's check out this really dirty aquarium.
1904400	1908400	Look, and glass is terribly stained, making it impossible to see inside.
1912400	1920400	I touch it. I hesitantly stick my hand in the tank. When I do, my fingers touch something cold.
1920400	1926560	There's water left inside. Just water. For some reason, Mashita looks disappointed.
1927760	1932240	Of course. There's enough water left inside that I could scoop it up if I had a container.
1932960	1934160	I do have a container!
1934320	1939680	I do have a container! I have... this plastic bottle! Yeah!
1940960	1945680	I take the plastic bottle out and put it in the tank. It gurgles as it fills with water.
1947760	1949280	Got bottle of water.
1952480	1961680	Or, as some people say, oh!
1964320	1971120	What are you gonna do with it? I don't know! I want it! Why? If I can use it, I want it!
1972720	1977920	Okay, let's look. When you open an umbrella in a typhoon, it will break because the wind's too strong.
1978560	1983840	So first, I tried to put holes in an umbrella. The way... that way, it wouldn't break a strong wind.
1990800	1992880	And who would those people be? Hmm?
1994880	1995600	The British.
2006160	2011520	Oh my gosh! Okay, I think I need to put on a sweater, Senpai.
2014080	2016080	I think I need to put on a sweater, Senpai.
2024560	2034480	British jumpscare. A bit too chilly. Yeah, it's super cold!
2037040	2038720	I think that's why I'm coughing a lot.
2043760	2048880	I think that's why I'm coughing a lot because I'm gonna wear this cardigan.
2048880	2054160	Yeah, I always have a cardigan with me.
2060800	2062160	And... Blake it up!
2066560	2073440	It's super hot here. If I had to choose between hot versus cold, I would choose cold.
2073520	2081040	I can be under many layers, but I cannot strip more.
2087200	2091760	Okay, I cannot remove the skin.
2094880	2095680	I don't know why.
2095840	2102640	Um, Stroni was wearing a sweater and nothing else.
2107920	2108560	Oh my!
2112240	2115920	Who let you remove our skin, Kohei? Really? You'd let me do that?
2118480	2124720	You would let... you'd let me do that, Senpai? You let me tear your skin off?
2126320	2131760	No, when using it, put a plastic sheet on it to transform it into an extra strong umbrella.
2132400	2136400	A strengthened umbrella protects from thorns or branches blown by the wind.
2137520	2142240	Okay, if I... that's a hint. Yes, that's how kids think.
2143360	2145040	He acts like he was never a kid himself.
2146400	2148720	What? No, it's nothing.
2156640	2158480	Anything else here? We looked there.
2160960	2162400	I think we already looked here.
2166000	2167040	Uh, did we?
2170240	2172880	Anything else? Sparkle.
2177200	2179600	Now, okay, we're good. Let's get out of here.
2186160	2189600	Oh my gosh, I misaligned the buttons again!
2196240	2201600	Okay, there I go.
2205680	2206000	Okay.
2212480	2214960	We already went there, it looks like, I think.
2216400	2218800	Okay, move forward!
2226480	2229680	The broken window is letting in piercing cold wind. Okay.
2231520	2232080	What's that?
2232960	2236000	The rain coming in from the broken window is making the floor cold and damp.
2245680	2248880	Are we at the end of the hall? I found you, kid!
2248880	2249520	Fucking kids.
2251840	2252720	Climb the stairs.
2256720	2257840	Anything around here?
2263120	2266160	Pieces of concrete litter the floor. I think they came from the walls.
2276480	2282080	Ah, that's why it's cold. Yeah, climb the stairs.
2283840	2287040	Plies in the snakes cover the hallway. I'd be foolish to keep going.
2288560	2295440	I decided to go back to the landing. Okay, let's go back down then. Let's go back down.
2296000	2305440	Can we go in here already? I don't know if we can go in here already.
2307040	2311040	Oh yeah, we did. We're out of here. I explored the heck out of that place.
2316320	2319200	How many snakes do you need to cover a staircase? A lot!
2319440	2326880	For one really big one. Wait, go back.
2336560	2338160	Did I ever look at this?
2340480	2344800	Look, the light on alarm is very faint. Something might be wrong with it.
2345760	2349760	I open up and shine the flashlight to see if there's anything inside.
2350720	2355440	Found a worn-out talisman. When I picked up the worn-out talisman, I feel warmth flow through me.
2358080	2359040	Got soul power.
2363040	2366560	The worn-out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.
2375760	2379200	There we go. What is soul power for?
2382560	2383760	Give me a moment, Senpai.
2386720	2389600	When you do quick time events and you do the wrong,
2393440	2404640	in each moment, you lose a soul power. So when you lose soul power and it hits zero, you die.
2405760	2409200	So these worn-out talismans look like they recover that.
2412000	2416640	Did I go in here already? Yeah, I already went in here.
2417440	2423360	So help, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Senpai. Yeah, you're so smart, Senpai.
2428240	2431840	I don't think we went into this room. Use the school key ring and open the door.
2431840	2436080	I move to step into the classroom.
2438000	2439920	And suddenly there's a strong grip on my shoulder.
2441280	2443680	I glance at the hallway out of the corner of my eye.
2446320	2449120	I'm pretty sure Mashita was on my other side.
2449760	2453280	No, even if they were on this side, they would have no reason to grab me.
2454560	2458000	Ah, here it is! Senpai, live or die.
2458880	2466160	Calm down, I'm just imagining things. My voice doesn't sound very convincing.
2469120	2472080	Don't panic, it's an illusion. Calm down, hold it together.
2473440	2475280	And I see Chou enveloped my right side.
2477040	2479440	I have 3,000 soul power, something's gripping my shoulder.
2480080	2480880	Oh.
2483680	2486000	Is that you? Is that you, Mashita?
2487440	2490000	I turn Mashita and open my mouth to tell them.
2490960	2491840	One, two, ah!
2496960	2497460	Safe.
2502400	2506880	I see a terrifying face in the darkness. Yeah, kids are pretty terrifying, huh?
2507840	2509920	Kids are terrifying creatures.
2514880	2519360	And then an outline laying in wait for me.
2524400	2526640	Oh no, oh no, oh no, what should I do? What should I do?
2527760	2531440	Uh, I'mma close my eyes! Fuck, close my eyes! Fuck!
2534000	2534800	Go light, go light!
2537680	2540400	Excuse my eyes, shut and pray.
2541920	2549120	Safe! Oh yeah! I knew it, if I, I knew it, I knew, I knew if I said something I'm probably gonna
2549120	2554480	die because this kid hates adults, right? This ghost kid hates adults. So if they hear a deep
2554480	2564240	voice they'll be like, oh my gosh, it's an adult, die! Just then. Hey, what's wrong?
2567120	2573920	With Mashita's voice, the figure vanishes. I find myself standing in front of the door.
2575280	2576480	Survive. Woo!
2582960	2589600	The mark burns scarlet. Dawn, half an hour left until death closes in.
2591200	2595280	We are gonna disregard time because I'm gonna spend a few more hours playing.
2597200	2604400	You okay? Yeah!
2607200	2612880	Mashita picked something off my left shoulder. This is...
2614960	2618560	The hand I felt gripping my shoulder was actually a rose thorn.
2618880	2631680	But more importantly, Mashita, what's the matter? You're acting kind of... acting kind of what?
2633680	2635440	Something's wrong, he's not acting normal.
2637200	2642800	Amnesia, my heart pangs with worry. Is Mashita spacing out because the mark's curse has progressed?
2643760	2649200	But I don't understand. I'm still the same, at least as far as I know.
2652560	2660320	Come on, hurt right. Mashita shuffles forward like a zombie. Something is seriously wrong.
2661520	2668320	Bad. Danger kept on us so quickly for running out of time. This condition might get worse.
2669360	2670320	I'll figure something out.
2673600	2680960	Okay, here we go. What's that? A white powder substance scattered around. Look.
2682240	2687920	A coarse powder, a glitters in the glow of the flashlight. Is it, is it cocaine?
2694240	2700480	I'm not really inclined to sticking it in my mouth to make sure, but it's probably so. Oh, okay.
2703600	2710720	Okay, it's salt. If I had a container, I'd take some with me. I do have a container. I have...
2715760	2721280	Ball water. My powder seems to be salt. Take out the bottle of water and fill it with powder.
2722160	2723040	Oh, it's salt water.
2724000	2734960	First purify with sea water. Yeah. I hear that voice again. Sea water. So that would be salt water, then?
2736320	2739200	Oh, hi. I can't read Japanese. What does this say?
2740640	2746240	Hey, hey. Oh, that's a lot of words I can't read. I can't read.
2749200	2751360	The plants are dry and withered.
2754000	2759920	Say, say, I can't read. I can't read.
2763440	2766960	Knee, knee, no, no.
2769520	2771680	Something about your car is extended warranty, probably.
2773840	2780400	Then say, could I? Oh, I hate teacher. Fair.
2780960	2782480	Fair.
2786320	2792480	I hate sensei. Got it. There are six office ladies who ride my train. I observed them for 10 days.
2797040	2802240	So true. When I was a kid, I was like, I don't like my teachers.
2802960	2810400	I learned popular colors are brown and pink. Everyone's hair is brown and their mouths are pink.
2815040	2820320	Feel it. Paper is falling apart. Got anyone who would care if I tore it off and took it with me.
2820960	2822480	Wait, I can take these?
2823200	2832800	I need to go back to the other room. I totally needed to grab those things.
2835280	2839840	Look. Experiment. I poured different liquids on the weed in my yard to see which was effective.
2839840	2840320	Results?
2841360	2845840	C. Miso soup and D. Salt water work. Conclusion. Salt can destroy weeds.
2846640	2851600	Solving salt in water first makes it easier for the plants to absorb and speed the effects.
2852160	2852720	Understood.
2857600	2862000	We'll take that as well. These are hints. We're going to go back and grab the other stuff.
2862880	2867920	Miso soup, yeah. Anything else? Oh, there's something on the ceiling.
2868800	2871520	Does the roof have a leak? The ceiling looks stained in places.
2876240	2880080	Anything else? I'm having this plant thing.
2885520	2887280	Oops. I didn't mean to do that.
2892240	2893200	I'm going to go back.
2899840	2904480	I'm going to go back because clearly we needed that one thing.
2905360	2908880	I'm going to grab those hints I saw.
2910960	2913760	Is it this one? Yeah, it was this one. I'm going to grab them.
2915680	2921920	Eel. Yeah, take it. Take it. Take it. Take it.
2924720	2931120	Miso has a lot of sodium. Oh, yeah, that's true. I like Miso soup. I like the kelp one.
2931840	2937680	I plan to strengthen weeds. I'm going to take this one, too.
2941520	2943200	I'm going to take that one, too. Thank you.
2945040	2946880	Umbrella that withstands typhoon.
2948400	2953600	We didn't find an umbrella before, did we? Oh, wait, hold on. It's a bed and desk. Look.
2954320	2957920	Yes, you'll find it at any other school. What's surprising? It doesn't look very weathered.
2958480	2960800	So that goes to show how durable school desks are.
2962160	2967280	Deal it. Stick my hand inside and feel around. Something pokes my finger. I grab it and pull
2967280	2975360	it out. Is it the umbrella thing? Yeah! What's it doing here? I have an idea. This umbrella might
2975360	2978720	have been part of the display for the independent research we found earlier.
2980320	2982560	Oh, though, what's the point? I'm going to use it.
2982880	2989920	I see the nicely folded dark plastic sheet amongst the garbage. Take it, too.
2992320	2997920	Their blood denies them. Denies them. Put it together and what have you got?
3000480	3005920	That conscious thought, I start speaking. Blood denies them. Does that mean repel with blood?
3005920	3014640	I pop open the wire umbrella and I spread the plastic sheet over it.
3016640	3020000	Huh, just like it says in the research paper, you can create something like an umbrella.
3020800	3024640	But it's not fast and dawn. It'll be impossible to carry it around like this.
3025360	3030400	But we'll have to hold it together to use it. Thankfully, there are two of us here. One person
3030400	3034720	to open the umbrella first and one person to spread the sheet. If you manage to combo like that,
3034720	3040720	we can use the blood stain sheet as an umbrella. Sorry to make you wait.
3041760	3046800	Right. Ashita gives a big reply. I'm sure it'll come in handy.
3048960	3054640	I feel like everything is here for a reason. New info was added to the spirit file. Blood stain,
3054640	3063440	umbrella. Okay, okay. We found the umbrella. I was like, okay, clearly we have something.
3064240	3074880	Uh, let's turn back and head this away. Where was I before? I think I was close to the end, right?
3080880	3087680	Anything else here? No more ugly kids? I don't think I have this ever open. Fire doors,
3087760	3090720	rested shut and won't move. Okay, that's probably useless then.
3093440	3094240	Climb the stairs.
3097520	3101280	Halfway up the stairs, I chip on something. What's this?
3103600	3105520	Moe's bag is on the staircase.
3108800	3114240	Got Moe's bag. Inside the bag is some random junk along with her school jacket.
3115040	3116240	If it's here, that means...
3120640	3122000	Is Moe still in the school?
3125200	3128480	But a cracked mirror is the only thing in sight.
3129120	3131840	If it's counting her bag, there's no trace of Moe anywhere.
3133040	3134800	In any case, we'll just have to keep looking around.
3135840	3136640	Isn't I looking now?
3138960	3143760	Look, it's a crack. There's cracks in the mirror. There's nothing else particularly odd about it.
3144560	3149360	Ew, my finger down the cracks. Mash it to watch as me wordly, but nothing happens.
3154720	3156000	Going to go up now?
3159760	3161680	Climb the stairs. I think we grabbed everything.
3162960	3165920	Twice in a snake's cover the hallway. Be foolish to try to keep going.
3167360	3169520	All right, we decide to go back to the landing.
3170480	3175920	Okay, well, anything else?
3177360	3180640	Well, do we have her bag? Oops.
3184560	3185520	Went down the stairs.
3191440	3192560	Am I missing something?
3195840	3198080	The broken window is letting piercingly cold air in.
3198160	3200480	Okay, hold on. Well, we're going to explore some more.
3201760	3205040	Part of these motherfucking snakes in my motherfucking school.
3206640	3210000	Okay, I think we checked everything here. We got the salt.
3222480	3225520	I was hoping to use the salt on it, but I guess I don't need it.
3228880	3231440	I don't think I need it.
3238320	3242960	My tonight is, I think, everything in this room.
3244800	3248960	The dust is so thick on the ceiling that just walking around causes showers of particles.
3248960	3254000	That's unsafe and unsanitary. I wonder this school is abandoned.
3258240	3261840	Anything around here?
3265840	3268240	Ceiling is filthy and the fluorescent lights are broken.
3275600	3278960	Wait, warning and contacts. Fire-containing warnings and list of contacts.
3281200	3283600	Do not leave handprints on the mirror in the eastern stairway.
3283600	3286160	Thank you, Independent Research Presentation, First Floor,
3286240	3287840	Multi-Purpose Classroom. Come check it out.
3288640	3290640	Independent Research, huh? Okay.
3294480	3295520	Uh, deal?
3298080	3299600	Don't find anything in particular.
3303520	3303760	Okay.
3308880	3312160	Mercy, can I say how attractive you are? Sempais loves you. Mwah!
3312160	3313840	And I love you, Sempai. Mwah!
3316960	3319760	I swear I went through everything. Did I not go through everything?
3323760	3324480	Okay, hold on.
3331680	3335040	What does this say? I can't read this either.
3337440	3339520	There's nonsensical scribbles on the blackboard.
3347120	3352960	The dust is so thick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, same thing.
3352960	3355520	Okay, so we're going to assume everything on the ceiling.
3358720	3362080	Can you do anything with Moe's bag? Here, let me check my bag first.
3365680	3368640	Oh, I can power Intelligence 11.
3370320	3372560	Okay, Dexterity 11, Dexterity 6.
3373200	3375920	What's this? Oh, that's the spirit file.
3378080	3380880	I have a flare, plastic sheet, school key ring,
3382880	3386400	a food umbrella, wire umbrella, Moe's bag.
3390080	3392480	Some textbooks and items of unknown purposes.
3395040	3397760	Oh, she's in the school! Somewhere, right?
3397760	3402400	Okay, she might be in that room again.
3405600	3408720	A wall near the window is burnt. There must have been a fire here a long time ago.
3411040	3414560	And the door in left the staff room. In here?
3418560	3421760	Open the glass door and check inside, but there isn't anything that catches my eye.
3421760	3430080	There's an entrance to the underground room. Go to the underground room.
3432160	3434880	Shall we go in there again? Yeah.
3439280	3440480	Is there anything else in here?
3443280	3447520	Right up corpse. Look, body is twisted in odd position as if still in pain even now.
3448240	3451600	Heal it, hesitantly search the corpse, but I don't find anything.
3454640	3462160	Okay, well, the bad room. Yeah, the bad room full of stuff that happened badly.
3462880	3464160	I'm checking through all of them, though.
3465760	3470400	Look, body is twisted in odd position, blah, blah, blah. Okay, touch it.
3471360	3476880	Okay, find anything about you. Touch it.
3485120	3487440	Okay, we got something. I hesitantly searched the corpse.
3488240	3495600	Something flashes within the vine by its feet. Got round hand mirror. Like a gift for a young woman.
3496320	3505200	Mark has died in deep crimson. A few minutes left until death closes in.
3506320	3510320	Shit! A loud noise suddenly rings out.
3513120	3516560	A terrible pain runs through my wrist. It feels like something's biting into my bone.
3516640	3523600	Ashita? Hey, are you listening? Yeah, I can hear you.
3526240	3530240	At least he's still replying to me. So, what the way he's acting is.
3531520	3533680	Can't keep going like this. Move, come on.
3534800	3539680	Shout rings through the building. New info was added to spirit file. Last hand.
3543200	3544480	Am I gonna fucking die now?
3546560	3561680	Oh well. R.I.P.
3569200	3572480	I'm getting, I'm guessing that's the titular death mark? Yeah.
3573280	3578400	Instant I step into the hallway. A strange, indescribable feeling hits me.
3578400	3581600	Like a solid presence is closing in on me from deep within the darkness.
3584960	3591680	A router appears out of nowhere. And it runs down the hallway. I thought that was it,
3591680	3595040	but it stopped the part way. Grim's back is left to see what we're doing.
3595760	3599360	Hey, wait up. I grabbed Ashita's wrist and chased after it.
3599840	3606400	We chase after the rabbit and we arrive at eastern staircase.
3608960	3611520	We quickly climb up the stairs and stand in front of the mirror.
3612400	3615920	Heard it. I look around for the creature.
3619440	3621680	Just then, red drops of something fall from above.
3625520	3626800	Scarlet rose petals.
3626880	3631360	I slowly raise my eyes up to the ceiling.
3638480	3640720	The instant I see that, I let out a groan.
3644640	3646240	Okay, over fine. It's fine.
3650080	3653680	It's heavily weighted with both fear and relief.
3656800	3657680	Snippets, don't look!
3662480	3664480	Moe is up there, hanging from rose vines.
3665840	3669040	It's her. He points at her, strangely amused.
3669840	3671120	But she's not the only one up there.
3671840	3674640	It's a corpse hiding in the vines, too. It looks like the guard.
3675760	3679920	Suddenly, the vines snap like the weight is too much.
3679920	3682160	Moe crashes painfully up to the ground.
3682480	3685920	Hey, hang in there!
3687200	3690880	Yeah. I quickly glance over her to make sure she's not hurt.
3690880	3694720	The mark is obvious. It's swollen, pulsing, red like a giant.
3695440	3697360	Like a large, dangerous-looking pomegranate.
3699920	3702880	It looks like it progressed a lot further than the mark on my wrist.
3703840	3704960	See, so this is why.
3705840	3708320	Did she get desperate and come to the school to try to do something?
3709280	3710800	She did run away.
3712480	3714560	In any case, I need to get some clothes on her.
3714560	3718560	Take the jacket out of her bag and slide her arm into a sleeve.
3718560	3722400	She's still pretty out of it, but she manages to get a rest on by herself.
3725680	3728320	Huh? Oh, it's you, mister! Why?
3729680	3732960	The mark's progression must be affecting her, just like Mashita.
3732960	3735120	I doubt anything that I would say will make sense to her.
3735680	3736640	Besides, right now...
3739360	3739920	He's here.
3741920	3743760	And uh, Niko is.
3745280	3747760	I know, but what should I do? What am I supposed to do?
3748880	3750160	There's nowhere to hide.
3750160	3752560	I look at Moe and Mashita, their eyes are unfocused.
3753120	3755120	We'll die here. We'll all die here.
3755120	3757680	I'm the only one who might have a chance of overturning that fate.
3760000	3764320	Gaining the key and letting the grudge befall me by to survive.
3765680	3772960	You'll be required to be callous to make the escape of the spirit appear.
3775520	3778480	The way to repel the spirit hides within its grudge.
3784400	3786720	Mary's words echo in my head.
3788640	3792400	I open my bag and look through everything I picked up throughout the school.
3792400	3794880	It's one of these, the key, but it all looks like junk!
3795600	3799200	I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get through this.
3799200	3800320	Garbage is all I have.
3801600	3802320	And Niko.
3803360	3806160	My first saw him in this mirror, he was just a monster.
3806160	3808480	Now I feel like I know why he came to be.
3808480	3809520	I just have to face him.
3809520	3811280	Believe that I have the final key.
3812400	3812800	Believe.
3813440	3814400	Trust in myself.
3816640	3817440	Who's the partner?
3817440	3818800	Uh, we're gonna choose the girl!
3819520	3821520	Cause uh, Moe, Moe, Moe!
3825920	3827920	Ha ha ha ha ha!
3828640	3830880	I grab them, shake their shoulder and yell.
3831680	3832720	Get it together!
3832720	3833920	There's nowhere to hide!
3834880	3835600	We have to go!
3835600	3836640	Come with me!
3836640	3837280	Hanna Hiko.
3838720	3840800	Uh, because Hanna Hiko hates adults.
3842240	3843280	Moe, Moe, Q?
3843840	3845600	Moe, Moe, Q?
3848800	3850160	Moe makes a big sound.
3850160	3850880	That's good enough.
3852000	3854320	We're going to release him from his curse!
3855200	3856080	Ha ha ha ha ha!
3863920	3864640	Listen here, kid.
3870160	3872080	Okay, listen here, you- oh, okay.
3874400	3876320	Hanna Hiko is staring at Moe.
3877920	3880000	Hey, they aren't a grown-up.
3880000	3880480	I knew it!
3880480	3880960	I knew it!
3880960	3881360	I knew it!
3882320	3885600	Fine, only big people die, okay?
3888160	3891920	Sound like slithering vines come from Hanna Hiko's direction.
3903280	3904080	That's gross.
3906480	3907120	Okay, okay.
3907760	3910160	So, okay.
3910160	3913280	Review, review our notes, Senpai, before we continue.
3913840	3915760	Review our notes.
3915760	3919120	We have the weed, the plant destroyer,
3919840	3925600	and then we have the thing with the- that can stop thorns.
3925600	3926080	We're good.
3928800	3929760	That's salt water.
3929760	3932320	We got the thorn thingy that will protect us,
3932320	3933760	and we got the red stuff.
3935520	3937120	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the umbrella.
3937120	3937600	We got them.
3937600	3938080	We got it.
3938080	3938560	We got it.
3940960	3950480	The next thing I know, a sharp- small sharp object raises my face.
3953840	3954320	Missed.
3956240	3957920	You won't be so lucky next time.
3959840	3963120	I get the feeling Hanna Hiko's planning to attack me from a distance.
3963120	3965520	I need to do something to reach him from this far away.
3967120	3968080	Facing a spirit.
3968640	3973040	To defeat a spirit, you must use the item right to item at the right time.
3973040	3975440	Okay, we got- we got this.
3977840	3981120	Both you and your partner can use one item each.
3982160	3983920	Choose according to the situation.
3987840	3989840	Okay, let's use the umbrella to protect us first.
3992480	3993600	Item usage limit.
3994160	3996720	Some items are limited use, so please take care.
3998400	4000320	Check the number to the right.
4001360	4004160	Also, some items cannot be used when facing a spirit.
4006480	4012160	By the way, when did you last say uh at the mansion?
4015840	4016720	Combo actions.
4018800	4021680	When facing a spirit, two items can be used together.
4021680	4023120	This is a combo action.
4023920	4031840	It is executed if you and your partner use the right items.
4038480	4042160	Did I use- do I- okay, we have the umbrella, right?
4042160	4044880	So do we need to use the tarp and the umbrella at the same time,
4044880	4047200	or do we already have that kind of made?
4049520	4050320	I can't remember.
4053440	4055920	I can't remember if I did that or not.
4055920	4057680	I think we've already made it, right?
4057680	4058960	But someone has to hold it.
4061440	4062320	I'll figure it out.
4067040	4068160	It works as a combo?
4068800	4070160	You think it works as a combo?
4070160	4072320	Okay, we'll probably have to use the combo then.
4075520	4076560	Strategy hint.
4078400	4081840	You can read the spirit file or item descriptions at any time.
4083360	4085200	Open your bag using Y.
4086880	4087840	Okay, well.
4094720	4099680	You use- okay, oh yeah, it has to be used as together.
4101120	4102080	Wire umbrella.
4103360	4106080	Uh, a six sheet.
4108880	4112720	Yes, yes, yes.
4112800	4114320	The umbrella and then the plastic sheet.
4115280	4115600	Yes.
4117200	4119360	I put the plastic sheet over the wire umbrella.
4120880	4123040	I ready to cobble together an umbrella.
4123040	4124720	This should be able to block the thorns.
4125920	4127040	What the heck is that?
4127040	4128800	That umbrella, he's in my way.
4129920	4131680	His cold voice rings out,
4131680	4132880	sounding slightly angry.
4134720	4136960	Kind of he goes shoots a red- a rose thorn.
4138160	4140560	Thorn fires as fast as bullets,
4140560	4142480	but only bounces off the bloodstained sheet.
4142880	4144480	Yes, yes, yes, we got this.
4145600	4147760	Their blood- their blood denies him,
4147760	4148800	so that's what it meant.
4150000	4153680	The impact of the thorn causes the sheet to start to fall off the umbrella.
4154240	4155840	We don't put it back on.
4155840	4157200	We won't be able to protect ourselves.
4159280	4160800	Okay, we're close, we're close, we're close.
4163440	4165040	Kind of he goes sways closer,
4165760	4167520	as if the umbrella is irritating him.
4168560	4170160	Um, do I do it again?
4171040	4172560	Ten pies, do you think I do it again?
4174080	4176720	How close does he- does Hanahiko need to be,
4176720	4177520	so I can be like,
4178400	4179840	Behold!
4179840	4180640	Salt water!
4184560	4186080	Why do I just do salt water now?
4187120	4189600	He might be able to do something if he comes a little closer.
4189600	4191040	Okay, he has to come a little closer.
4191040	4200720	How to weaken spirits.
4200720	4201520	Okay, okay, okay.
4202240	4203120	Okay, one more time.
4205120	4206000	To defeat a spirit,
4206000	4208240	you must use a specific item to weaken them.
4209040	4212560	It can't be used until the spirit is as close as possible.
4214320	4216000	Okay, we have to protect again,
4216000	4219200	and then yes, yes,
4219200	4220560	we'll have to protect again,
4220560	4222080	and then we'll use the salt water,
4223280	4223680	I think,
4225760	4228480	and yeah.
4231760	4233120	And then the red thing, right?
4233680	4234640	Give me the red thing,
4234640	4236480	so the red thing I think is the lipstick.
4238560	4239360	When that happens,
4239360	4242000	the green- the screen outline will glow red,
4243520	4246240	and deer the spirits attack until they are in range.
4246240	4248240	Okay, it's not red yet,
4248240	4252000	so um, classic cheat.
4254960	4256000	Wire umbrella.
4258640	4259840	It's not red yet, is it?
4260960	4261280	Yeah.
4265440	4266080	It's still green.
4268160	4270320	Put the wire umbrella over the plastic sheet,
4272640	4274000	and he goes to choose a red thorn.
4275280	4277600	Okay, okay, is this- is this red?
4278240	4278800	Is this red?
4280560	4281840	Ten pies, is this red?
4283760	4284560	Not yet.
4284560	4286160	Do we do it again, then?
4286160	4308080	One more time.
4316160	4317600	Put the wire umbrella over the plastic sheet.
4319520	4321200	And he goes to choose a red thorn.
4323600	4324880	Is it close now?
4324880	4325760	Is it red now?
4327120	4328080	Yes, this is red!
4329280	4330960	And he goes- comes up close.
4335760	4341200	Countless vines wriggle in his oddly shaped head.
4342160	4344560	They're like poisonous snakes about to strike their prey.
4346320	4348400	At this distance, the umbrella is pretty useless.
4349040	4351520	It's obvious I'll be killed instantly if I don't do anything.
4352400	4354240	This close distance is my only chance.
4355200	4357440	Should I use an attack against spirit,
4357440	4359680	or an attack against plants?
4361040	4362320	Is there a way I can fight back?
4363040	4364640	Yeah, let's use-
4369200	4370000	The salt water,
4372560	4373120	and Moe,
4374800	4375760	the lipstick, right?
4377120	4379280	Right, right, ten pies?
4379280	4380800	We use the red- the red.
4380800	4381680	Yes, use the red!
4382640	4383040	Right?
4383680	4384480	Right, right, right!
4385200	4385600	Red!
4389920	4390560	Salt water!
4391280	4393680	Darling throws the salt water at Hanahiko!
4398640	4401600	Vines hit the salt water, quickly stops moving.
4402320	4404640	In the hazy darkness, I can see Hanahiko's face
4405200	4406160	twisting in pain.
4409200	4409840	Oh, mean.
4410640	4412640	Are you going to tease me now too, mister?
4413600	4415760	He starts sniffling as if he's about to cry.
4419040	4420000	It looks weakened.
4421840	4422880	Hanah defeats spirits!
4423680	4427760	A- defeat a weakened spirit by using specific items.
4427760	4429840	Choose an item based on the info you gathered.
4429840	4431920	You only have one chance, then carefully.
4431920	4432960	It's the red lipstick!
4433920	4435120	I got the lipstick.
4438400	4440160	Put the lipstick on Hanahiko's lips.
4441760	4442560	What did you do?
4443680	4444720	Hanahiko is weakened.
4445440	4446240	Lipstick again?
4446240	4447440	Do we use the lipstick again?
4449440	4450000	What do we do?
4454960	4455440	Ten pies!
4462960	4471680	Mirror, mirror, and then lipstick!
4486560	4487360	Lipstick!
4487360	4487680	Yeah!
4488800	4490400	Show, use lipstick!
4493840	4494400	Be gone!
4495760	4498400	Smear the lipstick on him and try to place the mirror in front.
4498400	4500880	Put the lipstick on Hanahiko and place the mirror in front of him.
4501920	4503120	He stares at his reflection.
4505280	4506880	This is red stuff.
4508880	4511040	I've been looking for this for so long.
4511760	4513280	The keepsake from my mom.
4514960	4517040	Are these memories from when he was alone?
4517040	4517840	I don't know.
4517840	4518560	I don't know.
4518560	4519120	I don't know.
4519120	4519840	I don't know.
4519840	4520560	I don't know.
4520560	4521120	I don't know.
4521120	4521840	I don't know.
4521840	4523200	Memories from when he was alive?
4524080	4525520	He smiles with his red lips.
4528960	4529760	Am I pretty?
4534160	4534640	We did it.
4537920	4540720	The spirit mounts into the darkness with a smile on his face.
4549040	4550720	I don't sense Hanahiko anymore.
4552560	4555440	Did we win?
4556480	4557040	Seriously?
4559280	4559600	Yeah.
4560800	4562560	Kind of hard to believe, but looks like we did.
4566320	4566720	Mister!
4567600	4568640	My mark disappeared!
4569680	4571440	Well, I cheers as she studies her leg.
4572000	4574000	Her mark has been burned into a right thigh.
4575280	4576720	Oh, what about yours?
4577600	4578720	Oh yeah, my right hand.
4581840	4582640	It's still there.
4583280	4585440	My mark looks exactly the same as before.
4588480	4588880	Why?
4588880	4590000	Why isn't it going away?
4592560	4593520	Sorry, mister.
4594880	4595680	It's almost gone.
4596720	4598320	Am I going to die?
4602240	4603360	So this is where you've been.
4604080	4605840	My head suddenly stopped feeling fuzzy.
4605840	4606800	Then my mark was gone.
4607440	4608320	Looks like you did it.
4610160	4610480	Yeah.
4612560	4613840	But he still has his mark.
4617040	4617760	Let's head back.
4618320	4619600	Maybe Mary knows something.
4621040	4621840	Yeah, you're right.
4623120	4623760	Come on, mister.
4623760	4624240	Let's go.
4625840	4626800	Oh, it leads the way.
4631440	4631940	Huh?
4634240	4635520	Oh, he's digging around her bag.
4637440	4639360	Oh no, my wallet's missing.
4639360	4640480	I dropped it earlier.
4642800	4645680	Her glance back at the school is confused.
4646880	4649280	But you're definitely more important right now.
4649280	4650480	We've got to hurry and get back.
4652240	4652720	Go on.
4653440	4653940	Huh?
4654960	4656480	Let's make sure you're back in five minutes.
4657280	4658080	Go get moving.
4658960	4659920	Great, great, thanks!
4661280	4662880	The boy rushes back into the school.
4664720	4666160	You're pretty calm considering.
4668240	4671520	The boy shrinks in the distance until they disappear inside the building.
4672640	4676000	The bitingly cold wind just whips past me.
4680240	4681200	It's coming from the school.
4681200	4683440	That's not normal, especially for the start of summer.
4686000	4688960	Wind dies down and out of nowhere I get a really bad feeling.
4689600	4690160	Wait, no!
4691520	4693280	I have like Moeco back inside.
4698800	4699760	Five minutes pass.
4700320	4703120	Wait, did I fuck up?
4704480	4705520	Moe isn't back yet.
4706400	4708160	Idiot, this is no time to doaddle.
4710880	4711520	Better check.
4716720	4718800	I step inside and go down the right hall.
4718800	4721520	Make it all the way to the front room where we fought Hanahiko, but...
4724480	4725680	I don't see Moe anywhere.
4730720	4732560	Strange, this should be the place.
4736400	4737120	It missed her?
4742720	4743840	Scared the crap out of me.
4746640	4750320	Fucking hell bitch, what the fuck, that was five minutes longer!
4753600	4754640	What are you doing here?
4755920	4757840	You're late so I came looking for you.
4757840	4759200	She's alive!
4759280	4762640	We saved our... our... our Kohai?
4764560	4765760	Oh, I'm so sorry.
4766320	4767920	It's dark so it took longer.
4768640	4770160	I should have borrowed the flashlight.
4771120	4772480	She bows in apology.
4773040	4776480	I'm so relieved a huge weight lifts off my shoulders when I see she's okay.
4777840	4779920	Hey, let's get a move on already.
4782000	4783600	Kohai saved a Kohai, yeah!
4785200	4788080	We all climb into the car and head straight to Kujo Mansion.
4789600	4795120	I almost thought I fucked up somehow.
4802160	4802960	I'll come back.
4803680	4806400	My mark's gone, so that must mean we beat Hanahiko, right?
4806960	4808720	This Moe seems to be okay too.
4809600	4810640	I'm pretty amazing.
4812400	4812720	Huh?
4813360	4814080	What's wrong?
4814080	4815040	You're not smiling.
4816560	4818960	Well, his mark hasn't disappeared.
4819600	4820080	What?
4820640	4821200	Why not?
4822640	4823440	Hey, darling?
4823440	4824480	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
4828000	4829040	I'll fill the pip squeak in.
4830480	4831920	You go hear what Mary has to say.
4834960	4838800	Welcome back, Lord Darling.
4842880	4846960	It appears you overcame your fear and cleared away the grudge.
4847600	4849120	Congratulations are in order.
4850320	4853920	Your tone is the same as always, but for some reason it grates me.
4859120	4860240	What's so great about it?
4864400	4865840	Why hasn't my mark vanished?
4867280	4870880	It is likely the one who gave it was not Hanahiko.
4877920	4881760	I'm suddenly light-headed, the world fading.
4881760	4886240	I'd risked my life during that investigation, and it was completely useless to me.
4887280	4890880	I guess all that's left is waiting for Dawn and my death.
4895040	4895760	Alright, darling?
4902960	4906640	Senpai, darling, is going to be constantly rizzed up by everyone in this game.
4907040	4908000	Sure is.
4908000	4909120	At least we saved everyone.
4909120	4909680	Yeah.
4909680	4911360	I thought I had a moment where I was like,
4911360	4911680	DUNNNNNNNNNNNN!
4911680	4912960	FUCK UP, I SMEEE!
4916560	4919600	If it is alright with you, would you mind showing me your mark?
4922800	4924640	I hold my arm out towards Mary.
4926240	4929440	Her neck shifts slightly as she stares at the mark.
4932400	4933440	It is as I thought.
4933440	4941440	It is only a minuscule fraction, but the fate I sensed from this mark has been distorted.
4941440	4945440	What does that mean?
4945440	4948440	Is it because I beat Hanahiko?
4948440	4958440	The flame of your life was indeed fading at one point, but now it has become brighter.
4958440	4960440	Are you saying?
4960440	4964440	What if the mark was on the butt cheek, just though?
4964440	4967440	Then I guess you have to check out your butt cheek.
4967440	4969440	She's going to have to look at your butt cheek.
4969440	4974440	Isn't that right, Senpai?
4974440	4976440	I'm not going to die at dawn.
4976440	4985440	That is correct.
4985440	4990440	My sigh of relief is so deep, it feels like my soul is escaping my body.
4990440	4994440	If only Kohai allows it.
4994440	5004440	Well, I mean, I don't want my Senpai to die, not by my hand.
5004440	5008440	So I guess you'll have to check it for me.
5008440	5025440	But at the same time, any funny business and you will die before dawn anyways.
5025440	5030440	The mark's still burned on me, but it seems I'll be okay for now.
5030440	5037440	Life or death?
5037440	5045440	Your choice, quick time events, Senpai.
5045440	5049440	It appears the mark- wait, sorry.
5049440	5054440	It appears the mark you bear is different from the other ones I know of.
5054440	5059440	But there is no doubt that it was given to you by a spirit.
5059440	5064440	Then there are other spirits like Hanahiko that gives people marks?
5064440	5072440	Yes.
5072440	5074440	Spirit-born.
5074440	5080440	Spirit-born of grudges have an insatiable hatred for the living.
5080440	5086440	This persistent hatred is not seen by simply killing the living.
5086440	5091440	Rather, they drag their victims to the depths of despair before their death.
5091440	5093440	That is what they desire.
5093440	5098440	The mark is an effective method.
5098440	5101440	Spirits who wish to terrorize the living.
5101440	5105440	The more- the more I hear them, the less I understand.
5105440	5111440	It appears something within each city can easily create such spirits.
5111440	5115440	Though I could not say what it is.
5115440	5121440	So for me to escape my mark, I need to find the spirit that gave it to me and take care of it then?
5121440	5127440	Yes, it is logical to believe the mark would disappear, the spirit.
5127440	5134440	That is the only way to escape death and regain your memories.
5134440	5137440	Great!
5137440	5142440	It will soon be done. I'm sure that you are all tired. Please rest.
5142440	5147440	You are free to use any room.
5147440	5153440	Thank you so much! Seriously! If you hadn't been there, I probably would have been killed by Hanahiko.
5153440	5163440	But when I think about you still having your mark, it's hard to be happy.
5163440	5170440	Well, I'm going to bed. Good night!
5170440	5175440	You did great work today. You're much more competent than all other adults I know.
5175440	5179440	Though it only makes sense for adults to help children.
5179440	5184440	It will be challenging from now on. My schoolwork has suffered due to my memory loss.
5184440	5187440	I need to study hard to catch up. You do your best too.
5187440	5193440	Well then, good night.
5193440	5201440	Think of, I'm heading off myself. With that mess of trouble taken care of, I'm sure I'll crash right away.
5201440	5205440	Alright, here have this.
5205440	5211440	He pulls a small paper item from his beat-up coat and hands it to me. Looks like a newspaper article.
5211440	5216440	It's about that boy who died before he was adopted. He lived with his mom.
5216440	5221440	She understood her son, unlike his hard and adoptive father.
5221440	5226440	Father should put makeup on him in front of a mirror. Very much doted on him.
5226440	5233440	After all that hell at a young age and dying, that was probably his only good memory.
5233440	5244440	Now she does smile, sad. Well, it's up to you how you interpret it. Do whatever you want. See ya!
5244440	5251440	Alright, darling, there's something I must tell only you.
5251440	5256440	About those who lost their marks, they must leave in the morning.
5256440	5262440	Those who escaped their fate should return to their daily lives. That is the will of Lady Zaya.
5262440	5269440	So I'll be the only one left behind? I feel like a student repeating a grade.
5269440	5278440	Alright, darling, by any chance, are you uneasy about being the solo occupants in this mansion?
5278440	5283440	Uh, Senpai, what should we say?
5283440	5290440	Kind of, eh? Not at all. You're here. You're here? Okay, I'll say, well, you're here.
5290440	5295440	Riz time.
5295440	5302440	Not at all? Yeah, we're gonna Riz.
5302440	5312440	I must express my extreme gratitude that you hold me in such regard. Although the things I am capable of, they are rather limited.
5312440	5320440	Mary stairs unblinkingly in. I could just be extrapolating, but it seems like she's thinking about something.
5320440	5332440	Now then, Lord Darling, it would be for the best that you take your rest as well. Please find me when you are ready.
5332440	5334440	Farewell.
5334440	5338440	Oh, she's a doll? Yeah, she's a doll.
5338440	5345440	New info was added to the spirit file. Mashi just collection of articles, other.
5346440	5353440	Uh, I forgot how to save here. Wait, next save. Ha ha!
5370440	5372440	Yeah, let's rest.
5372440	5375440	Good night.
5378440	5385440	So we can Riz the doll and, uh, not die? It doesn't count, right?
5391440	5398440	Another night greets me. It's been three days since the investigation and not one glimmer of hope for me.
5398440	5403440	Time idles by as death draws even closer to claim me.
5409440	5416440	The mark that brings death. The only way to escape it is to defeat the spirit that gave it to me.
5417440	5428440	But I have no clue where that spirit is right now. Maybe things would be different if that specialist Sayakujo was alive.
5428440	5433440	The knock breaks my train of thought.
5433440	5439440	Oh hey! Oh hey! Look, Senpai, it's our not boyfriend!
5440440	5443440	Our not boyfriend for our very manly sa-
5448440	5450440	How long do you plan on sleeping?
5452440	5457440	You're pretty relaxed for a guy who could die soon. Can you raise him up maybe?
5458440	5475440	The ex-detective Satoru, Satoru, Satoru Mashita, the other markbearer left the mansion, but he stayed behind. Mary was the cause. I guess she asked him to help as he was leaving.
5475440	5482440	She went against Sayakujo's wishes by doing that, but it seems it was for my sake.
5488440	5495440	But I don't know about Mashita. Even if he was asked to stay, he has no reason to agree.
5496440	5501440	What's that look? Not happy I stayed behind? No! Very happy!
5503440	5506440	I'm grateful! We're going to Rizz!
5508440	5510440	We're gonna Rizz, we're gonna Rizz, okay? I'm grateful.
5511440	5516440	Cut that out, it's creepy. Damn it! Damn it!
5525440	5529440	Why am I always shot down?
5531440	5537440	We have no Rizz mercy, this is what happens. Why do we have none? We can't win the maw.
5537440	5542440	Man, I was hoping that it would be like, darling.
5545440	5549440	Flatter me all you want, but I won't forget you drove without a license.
5550440	5554440	Wait, that's what you're mad about! Also, I do have a license, Senpai.
5555440	5559440	Do you have a license, Senpai? I wouldn't shoot you down, mercy. Oh, nice.
5559440	5566440	Nice! He's over mad over that!
5567440	5569440	Of course I do, okay, okay.
5571440	5575440	The criminal debuff, we have to be a good citizen now.
5579440	5583440	He's got a bad mouth, as usual. I've got my learner's permit.
5584440	5587440	What's keeping Senpai from getting the whole license?
5589440	5591440	No, sorry, Kohai, it's okay.
5593440	5594440	Learn together.
5596440	5598440	And your driving instructor called you Vomit Girl.
5600440	5602440	I still got my license.
5604440	5614440	I still got my license, even though to this day that driving instructor probably remembers me after vomiting in the car.
5620440	5624440	His true intention aside, I have to say I'm honestly grateful for his help.
5628440	5631440	Now the question is, do you have a car to use said license? Yeah.
5632440	5636440	Well, it's the family car, but I have a car.
5641440	5643440	My car is...
5643440	5647440	is a Toyota.
5648440	5649440	It's a RAV4.
5657440	5661440	My amnesia could hit without warning, so I can't go wherever I want.
5662440	5664440	A car is a car. A car is a car.
5668440	5671440	How many bad Senpais have you ran over with it?
5671440	5676440	I prefer to just chase all my own.
5677440	5679440	And how many crashes have you had?
5680440	5682440	Two. Not at fault, though.
5683440	5685440	Not at fault accidents. Both of them.
5693440	5696440	Yeah, doing it with the car isn't as intimate. You're right.
5697440	5702440	Both times was not at fault.
5704440	5707440	Is your insurance up to date? Oh, Kohai, yeah!
5708440	5709440	Were they bad crashes?
5715440	5720440	One of them was, and the other one...
5721440	5725440	My car was written off, the first car was written off,
5725440	5728440	but it was not my fault. I was parked,
5728440	5732440	I was stopped at a pedestrian crossing with pedestrians crossing,
5732440	5735440	and a car ran into my butt, the car butt,
5735440	5738440	and then I got like a concussion and stuff,
5738440	5740440	but it's not bad. I'm still here.
5745440	5748440	Were they texting and driving? I don't fucking know.
5748440	5758440	And the other one was like, just like a tiny, tiny thing.
5760440	5762440	So yeah, I was like, what the heck?
5764440	5765440	What the heck?
5770440	5775440	So yeah, it was just a long process, and I'm okay.
5776440	5779440	And I've also updated my insurance recently.
5780440	5783440	Right before, right before I joined VLR,
5783440	5786440	I updated my insurance and I was super stressed about it.
5793440	5796440	Because like, the cost of insurance went up, and I cried.
5796440	5798440	I cried a little.
5799440	5801440	Not because like, it was a while ago,
5801440	5803440	so it's not because of an accident or anything,
5803440	5805440	and my premiums went up, it's just all,
5805440	5807440	everything went up in price.
5808440	5810440	Did you remember the registration as well?
5811440	5813440	I'm registered, yeah.
5815440	5819440	I'm registered, don't worry, everything's good.
5826440	5828440	Gotta love price hikes, yeah.
5828440	5832440	Car insurance is cringe, but I have to have car insurance,
5832440	5836440	otherwise it's, otherwise it's not great.
5838440	5840440	Call hi, that doesn't sound convincing.
5840440	5845440	Well, I'm pretty sure everything's up to date, and I'm pretty sure.
5848440	5849440	I'm pretty sure.
5849440	5852440	Mama and Papa take care of the license plates registration,
5852440	5855440	and then I just have to take care of my drivers,
5855440	5857440	my driver stuff, yeah.
5858440	5861440	Anyways, this economy sucks.
5864440	5866440	Insurance is expensive.
5870440	5872440	How often do you drive?
5872440	5875440	Oh, like almost every day, depending.
5875440	5877440	Maybe more like every other day.
5880440	5882440	More like every other day because, you know,
5882440	5885440	sometimes I want to go out with my friends, right?
5888440	5891440	Don't forget the tire change for summer and the auto change.
5891440	5893440	Surprise, shut up!
5897440	5898440	Are you a good driver?
5898440	5900440	I would say I'm a good driver.
5902440	5904440	I would say I'm a good driver.
5905440	5907440	At least a defensive driver.
5911440	5913440	Anyways, surprise, shut up!
5917440	5919440	I think everything's, I know, I know, I know.
5919440	5922440	Everything, everything, everything is fine, I think.
5925440	5927440	I think everything's fine.
5927440	5929440	Is your state inspection up to date?
5929440	5931440	I'm sure everything's fine.
5931440	5933440	What about break, shut, shut up!
5933440	5935440	I'm sure everything's fine.
5939440	5941440	I'm sure everything's fine.
5941440	5943440	I'm sure everything's fine.
5950440	5953440	Listen, as your senpais, we worry about our coil.
5953440	5954440	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5955440	5958440	The jacks in the car, the spare tire is still there.
5958440	5960440	What about your air filter?
5960440	5962440	Stop!
5967440	5969440	Everything's up to date!
5971440	5973440	Everyone, yes!
5973440	5975440	The lights are fine!
5975440	5977440	I checked them!
5977440	5979440	I checked the batteries!
5979440	5981440	The oil is fine!
5981440	5983440	Gas is fine!
5983440	5985440	Brake pads are fine!
5985440	5987440	I feel like, I feel like...
5989440	5991440	I feel like, you know...
5991440	5993440	I feel like...
5993440	5995440	I feel like, you know...
5995440	5997440	I feel like...
5997440	5999440	I feel like...
5999440	6001440	I feel like, you know...
6005440	6007440	I feel like...
6007440	6009440	Senpais are like...
6009440	6011440	are like my parents now.
6015440	6017440	Did you lock it?
6017440	6019440	It's in the garage!
6029440	6031440	Did you lock your garage?
6033440	6035440	Did they lock?
6037440	6039440	It's done!
6039440	6041440	We're playing the game, Senpais!
6041440	6043440	Stop, stop, stop!
6051440	6053440	Wait, are you playing to escape using my car?
6059440	6061440	I don't know...
6061440	6063440	I don't know...
6063440	6065440	I don't know...
6065440	6067440	I don't know...
6067440	6069440	I don't know...
6069440	6071440	I don't know...
6071440	6073440	I don't know...
6073440	6075440	I don't know...
6075440	6077440	I don't know...
6077440	6079440	I don't know...
6079440	6081440	I don't know...
6081440	6083440	I don't know...
6083440	6085440	I don't know...
6101440	6103440	Senpai...
6103440	6105440	Senpai...
6107440	6111440	We're gonna have to teach you another lesson again!
6113440	6117440	We're gonna have to teach you another lesson again!
6121440	6123440	If you really love the Senpais, you give us the key!
6123440	6125440	Yeah, I'll give you a key!
6127440	6129440	I gave you the key to my heart,
6129440	6131440	and now you're gonna betray me, you bastards!
6131440	6133440	It's time!
6133440	6135440	It's time you learn another lesson, okay?
6137440	6139440	We're gonna do...
6139440	6141440	some broken legs!
6143440	6145440	...

6165440	6167440	...
6167440	6169440	...
6169440	6171440	Ugh!
6171440	6176060	that guard went missing his company should be notified that company is
6176060	6180720	exactly the issue it's run by yakuza thugs who have their eyes on the labor
6180720	6185000	department I know what the place involved plus in a shitty company like
6185000	6189980	that people up and walk out all the time yeah machita that was his name
6189980	6193760	everyone thinks he up and split here that's why they're having a hard time
6193760	6199600	finding replacement if you didn't know the school was haunted it would just be
6199600	6202760	another abandoned building the government wouldn't need to rush to find a
6202760	6207480	new guard the man lived alone so I'm missing person report won't be filed
6207480	6212280	soon the school most likely won't come under suspicion until then that's it for
6212280	6216600	my report he covered a lot of ground in a short time ex-detectives sure are
6216600	6225040	handy did you bring up the markers periods or when you were asking around do
6225040	6230720	you think I'm an idiot I'd be calling the looney bin even if the kids or I
6230720	6237480	bring them up who'd honestly believe us why waste my breath
6237480	6243800	exasperated he shrugs searching the mansion searching the mansion was on
6243800	6250680	was on you so did you find anything I came up blank as well though I only
6250680	6258840	gone through half so far and some of the rooms were lost stuck without a warrant
6258840	6264360	like you'd wait for something like that I swallowed the words before they came
6264360	6275000	out oh yeah Mary's asking for you you should get going to be fair nine out of
6275000	6281680	ten abandoned buildings are haunted are they I've been waiting for you Mary is
6281680	6286280	sitting primly on the couch the same as always
6289040	6295240	source yes have that has some pies have you seen a ghost
6297680	6303320	it appears you're having a difficult time with your investigation I do wish I
6303320	6309680	be of more use to you I know you can sense mark bearers can you send spirits
6309680	6320040	to if they were to come onto the grounds I believe I could yes ghost don't pay rent
6320040	6333000	or taxes I feel like if you ever move into into the into like a place that's
6333000	6341520	haunted I feel like I would demand the ghost to pay rent I think I would demand
6341520	6355000	the ghost to pay rent why did you bring up another I think I would force it to
6355000	6365080	pay rent probably it's only fair I think I'd like to be roommates with a ghost I
6365080	6372080	don't know they seem invasive you know invasive like you never really have true
6372080	6377680	privacy with a ghost around do ghosts have money I'm sure there's way for them
6377680	6391480	to make money that doesn't sound particularly useful do you have any
6391480	6397320	other abilities or powers like for example you know maybe they can be like a
6397320	6403280	detective like a detective and then though they can go into houses and figure
6403280	6415480	out if people are having affairs or they can you do guard stuff right maybe
6415480	6422160	they can get money they can watch people at your passwords or pins you have any
6422160	6429160	cage ghost cage for the senpais who die the senpais who die won't even have
6429160	6431160	spirits
6441160	6444160	why do you have spirits
6446160	6452160	why not they'll probably be exercised by by mama mama mercy
6459160	6472160	indeed I can view the big shape of the car course of a person's life predicting the future
6472160	6477160	a lot of me and mama mercy are cool like that
6477160	6479160	um
6485160	6490160	no no I don't think she would like it either so should probably exercise you anyways
6490160	6501160	oh no nothing quite so extreme it is more akin to fortune telling it may or may not come to pass
6501160	6510160	I get it that's why what you predicted earlier didn't actually happen
6511160	6516160	did Mary tell you something
6520160	6525160	can we just stay in the cage regardless you can stay in the cage of course
6525160	6529160	well that's your home senpai
6531160	6536160	the truth you're seeking can be found here or something such like a fool I felt
6536160	6539160	so convinced such an idiot
6555160	6558160	new characters
6567160	6571160	hey this place cool Joe mansion

6654160	6660160	anyway you guys knows her yeah would you hear me out
6672160	6679160	introductions are quickly done his name is soul Nagashima as we guess he's got a mark
6680160	6687160	he rolls up his right sleeve to show us and yep the red mark is burned in
6690160	6693160	and a cult freak friend says some
6695160	6699160	like it gives you a knee job for real
6700160	6713160	yeah that's true I can't even remember my real name you're kind of too calm for
6713160	6715160	all that
6716160	6720160	but you're pulling a fast one on me
6721160	6726160	what am I doing
6729160	6732160	that greats but the reaction is normal
6733160	6738160	but if he's not gonna believe the rumors then he's got no he has no reason to come
6743160	6746160	why is he here then
6747160	6754160	how rumors of just that I need you're on dying cuz of some mock that's comic book
6754160	6758160	craziness craziness
6759160	6767160	every word of it is true every word of it is true well what's that a ghost voice
6768160	6776160	there's a saying the truth is stranger than fiction
6777160	6783160	there are two sides of the same calling Mary begins explaining I'm sure she
6783160	6787160	figured out it would be fastest way to convince him
6787160	6798160	you got some damn speaker set up somewhere don't you don't you know I don't
6798160	6805160	take kind of wait wait I don't take kindly the threats I don't take kindly the
6805160	6816160	threats he peers closely at Mary that's a mechanism does not exist large
6818160	6825160	no way no way
6828160	6833160	he yells pathetically his eyes wide and suddenly falls flat on his ass
6838160	6843160	you seem to that despite appearances this punk is terrified of ghosts and
6843160	6855160	monsters he is tough act is likely a cover after that he meekly pays full
6855160	6860160	attention to Mary as she speaks he listens quietly his face pale as she
6860160	6866160	tells him about the mark and spirits by the time she finishes explaining his
6866160	6873160	face is devoid of color now large show have you not already experienced the
6873160	6882160	beginning of memory loss yeah I don't think he's used to marry it his face is
6882160	6888160	rather stiff my memory has always been crap so I thought I was imagining
6888160	6897160	things but now it's started so bad it was just ridiculous I got this occult
6897160	6905160	friend yeah told him about my scar the mock and he scared the shit out of me
6905160	6911160	showed me an article that said it was all the scars things fall
6911160	6921160	so now I'm here
6925160	6932160	Molly mentioned seeing an article by Sayaku Joe in a magazine to it's all
6932160	6942160	because of some monster the hell this is crazy why this has to happen to me
6942160	6949160	not believing is normal if you don't you die if you don't want to kick the bucket
6949160	6954160	figure out how you got the mark even if your memory's gone bad you should at least
6954160	6962160	remember that I'm not that far gone thanks
6985160	6996160	I think I think I definitely I'm going a little bit too silly hey I'm positive I
6996160	7003160	got in the fullest but each cast so I know I did I mean it does have a womb
7003160	7011160	about it the place being cursed so we should probably ask him more about it
7011160	7019160	forest the huge forest west of the city wait doesn't everybody everyone know
7019160	7029160	that even kids do but I've lost my memory maybe that's why I don't know about it
7029160	7035160	places the city's garbage dump bunch of nasty rumors about it there's a legal
7035160	7043160	industry industrial waste dumping there like all the time it's not just objects
7043160	7049160	either say a black car once dumped a young woman's body there a new mother
7049160	7056160	strangled her kid there because she could take it care of it did they say it
7056160	7063160	instead of of it okay yeah there's ton more rumors like that whether or not any
7063160	7070160	of them are true I heard some of those too like the gloss kid who'd eaten by dog
7070160	7075160	and they only found his torso or that murderous hides out there and kills
7075160	7089160	anyone gets near apparently while he hates ghost he's got more than fine with this
7089160	7099160	kind of stuff I've hit up the edge of the forest a few times but never walked in
7099160	7105160	no one would have a plane
7105160	7112160	what should I ask next it's cursed
7112160	7121160	a plane sorry I said plane
7121160	7128160	Joe stiffens like a board I hate that supernatural crap
7133160	7139160	I'm starting to let go we'll talk with this
7139160	7148160	just talking about it freaks me out
7148160	7157160	what a wimp
7157160	7165160	New York
7165160	7171160	rumor exists for a reason that place is a famous suicide spot 50 people die
7171160	7177160	there a year so they say and that's just what they find once there was a mass
7177160	7183160	suicide has a fair share of grizzly history
7183160	7191160	shows eyes are wide he looks like he swallowed a bug what should I ask
7191160	7198160	next why were you there I was obviously on my bike man places totally empty at
7198160	7204160	night so it's perfect for driving around riding around free as a bird helps me
7204160	7208160	clear my mind
7208160	7215160	before you ask yes I have my license and no illegal mods
7215160	7221160	huh is that so
7221160	7225160	we don't need another person flaunting the law when it's enough
7225160	7237160	I smile Riley Riley who would have thought this kid would be on the straight and narrow
7237160	7243160	that day I was clearing my head when my bike broke down
7243160	7250160	I'm so sad
7250160	7255160	I stopped to check it out then suddenly I got the scar
7255160	7259160	I definitely get any more out of show

7521160	7524160	however I have no proof
7524160	7530160	there are holes
7530160	7541160	there are holes in this house
7541160	7543160	then we'll have to gather evidence
7543160	7545160	let's get ourselves to the forest
7545160	7550160	investigation requires legwork
7550160	7552160	there's no hesitation in mashita
7552160	7559160	after facing hanahiko he knows full well what spirits are capable of
7559160	7563160	is this his training and experience as a police detective
7563160	7568160	ain't now you silly yes silly yes
7568160	7576160	going there in the middle of the night you guys are totally lost

7589160	7595160	I bound him to dust
7595160	7602160	he's easy to manipulate
7602160	7604160	you've set out on a destination
7604160	7606160	you've head to the forest by each castle
7606160	7608160	once you're ready
7608160	7612160	your first goal is to identify the spirit that bestowed the mark
7613160	7618160	best wishes for your investigation
7618160	7620160	new info was added to the spirit file
7620160	7623160	the forest and shimio
7623160	7625160	new chapter item changes
7625160	7629160	all items obtained within a chapter are removed at the end
7629160	7634160	if a character brings an item it will start the edit at the start
7634160	7636160	new chapter soul power
7636160	7639160	oh we'll return to 1000
7639160	7643160	shit okay what do we have
7643160	7647160	shimio
7647160	7649160	okay
7649160	7651160	first round by a stranger fans suicides and body dumping
7651160	7653160	and the likes are scared off their casual visitor
7653160	7656160	only the occasional test of courage brings a foolish kid inside
7656160	7658160	the paths are shaded at all hours with the trees
7658160	7661160	so it's easy to become lost amongst the rumors swirling
7661160	7663160	about this forest is one of a bizarre man
7663160	7665160	a spotted man shimio
7665160	7667160	is covered in dark splotches asks
7667160	7669160	he meets if they like bees
7669160	7673160	if they say yes he attacks while laughing maniacally
7673160	7675160	he sounds like you're standard crazy
7675160	7677160	but I guess he's the next spirit will face
7677160	7679160	at any rate we'll have to head to the forest to investigate
7679160	7681160	the forest... okay
7681160	7683160	we're good
7686160	7688160	who are we gonna take

7740160	7742160	dammit why
7746160	7748160	she'll throw himself into the passenger seat
7748160	7750160	and mumbles an endless
7750160	7752160	litany of complaints
7752160	7754160	I really want to tell him to shut up
7754160	7756160	but I'm pretty sure that'll only make things work
7760160	7762160	it's only natural for a guy his age
7762160	7764160	hey old man you got smokes
7766160	7768160	I blank in surprise
7768160	7770160	it's a cigarette uh
7770160	7772160	I instinctively put my hand in my pocket
7772160	7774160	but then I come to my senses
7776160	7778160	you're not old enough for that yet
7778160	7780160	shut up I'm 19 already it's fine
7782160	7784160	whoa you have your answer
7790160	7792160	19 but you're still in high school
7792160	7794160	now I've done it
7794160	7796160	I've overcome with regret the instant I say it
7796160	7798160	but I can't take it back now
7798160	7800160	well it skills me for repeating the grade
7804160	7806160	oh shit
7806160	7808160	oh shit
7812160	7814160	looks like I touched a sore subject
7814160	7816160	even though it wasn't my intention
7818160	7820160	oh no
7820160	7822160	senpai how can you be so callous
7830160	7832160	how can you be so callous
7832160	7834160	senpai
7838160	7840160	the atmosphere in the car was bad enough
7840160	7842160	and now I made it worse
7844160	7846160	it's okay
7846160	7848160	it's okay to repeat grades
7850160	7852160	I need to change the subject
7852160	7854160	so are you in a club or anything
7860160	7862160	how's this on us because
7862160	7864160	this the main character is senpai darling
7864160	7866160	remember
7866160	7868160	you look pretty fit so maybe baseball
7868160	7870160	or
7870160	7872160	yeah I played
7872160	7874160	but I quit
7874160	7876160	my emergency just saved
7876160	7878160	just swarmed into dangerous territory
7878160	7880160	oops
7886160	7888160	bulk bulk
7888160	7890160	rock my knee
7890160	7892160	too many laps
7892160	7894160	coach kept saying I had bad attitudes
7894160	7896160	look that I'm funny
7896160	7898160	sorry
7898160	7900160	why you apologize
7900160	7902160	I don't care about that shit
7904160	7906160	I couldn't really get into
7906160	7908160	it under that shitty coach anyway
7910160	7912160	I think I know now why he rides
7912160	7914160	his motorcycle alone in the mountains
7918160	7920160	but if he came to Kujo mansion after
7920160	7922160	I set back like that
7922160	7924160	ah fuck
7924160	7926160	it's seriously frustrating
7928160	7930160	keeps a string of swearing for a while
7932160	7934160	anyone would act the same
7934160	7936160	anyone would swear up a storm
7936160	7938160	but keep going down the same path anyway
7938160	7940160	down this dark uncertain road
7940160	7942160	that only leads to death
7954160	7956160	we arrive at the forest by H castle
7956160	7958160	I stopped the car near where Shou said
7958160	7960160	he saw the man and we entered the forest
7962160	7964160	all the guideposts on the path surfaded
7964160	7966160	their paints peeling off
7966160	7968160	it looks hardly travest
7968160	7970160	just as Shou and Mashita said
7972160	7974160	call
7974160	7976160	roll
7976160	7978160	sue
7978160	7980160	is that call
7980160	7982160	did I read it right?
7984160	7986160	I can't remember anymore
7990160	7992160	why don't we walk
7992160	7994160	a while
7994160	7996160	we come by a large arc marking the start of hiking trail
8002160	8004160	it's rested over and with the paint
8004160	8006160	peeling it doesn't seem to have been
8006160	8008160	it doesn't seem to have been touched up
8010160	8012160	the letters have faded
8012160	8014160	nor mostly
8014160	8016160	illegible
8016160	8018160	carefully reading it it says
8022160	8024160	welcome to the M
8028160	8030160	blush and romantic you are
8034160	8036160	wood timberland murder

8044160	8046160	coincidence that's all
8046160	8048160	it's just because it's way
8048160	8050160	old and faded
8050160	8052160	come on old man let's go already
8054160	8056160	we pass through the arc
8056160	8058160	and enter the forest
8062160	8064160	well let's look around first
8066160	8068160	I don't think I've been
8068160	8070160	it's been used in a long time there's no garbage littered
8070160	8072160	either
8072160	8074160	I feel around inside the container
8074160	8076160	but nothing's inside
8076160	8078160	dang it
8080160	8082160	the weather beaten
8082160	8084160	table and benches are clearly damaged
8084160	8086160	and rotting in places
8086160	8088160	feel I peek underneath the table
8088160	8090160	and find something stuck there
8090160	8092160	I found a worn out talisman
8092160	8094160	when I pick up the worn out talisman
8094160	8096160	I feel warm throw
8096160	8098160	me yes
8098160	8100160	I got soul power
8106160	8108160	the sworn out talisman crumbles silently
8108160	8110160	in my hand
8112160	8114160	I feel like I should go back
8114160	8116160	and like save
8118160	8120160	I'm gonna go back and save
8120160	8122160	I'm gonna go back and save
8122160	8124160	yeah
8124160	8126160	let's save first
8130160	8132160	actually let's do
8132160	8134160	no yes no yes
8134160	8136160	let's save here it's a new chapter
8138160	8140160	ouch
8140160	8142160	get myself
8142160	8144160	this game has time limits
8144160	8146160	or no
8146160	8148160	no
8148160	8150160	no
8150160	8152160	well they have quick time events
8154160	8156160	right
8162160	8164160	okay we're back there again
8168160	8170160	it reads welcome to the lush and romantic
8170160	8172160	wood timberland
8176160	8178160	let's move forward
8180160	8182160	can you down the path a short while
8182160	8184160	before we come across something unexpected
8184160	8186160	the grave marker was probably put there
8186160	8188160	to honor those who commit suicide here
8188160	8190160	might not be a bad idea to say a quick prayer
8190160	8192160	for those who ended their suffering melee
8196160	8198160	look something's written in magic marker
8202160	8204160	say the opposite of the truth
8204160	8206160	you'll be followed
8208160	8210160	so scowled to cover how his face
8210160	8212160	is definitely pale
8214160	8216160	you'll be followed the hells with that
8216160	8218160	dammit whose scribbles dumbass graffiti
8220160	8222160	um
8224160	8226160	I guess
8230160	8232160	when it says
8232160	8234160	I mean we have to lie
8236160	8238160	just off to the side
8238160	8240160	I noticed a faint trail
8240160	8242160	discovered entrance to the beast
8242160	8244160	to the beast trail
8246160	8248160	look there's a path over there too
8248160	8250160	ailment try to keep up
8252160	8254160	what the fuck did we go
8254160	8256160	you
8258160	8260160	lying officially allowed
8260160	8262160	first see who would
8262160	8264160	you say is the
8264160	8266160	the most facile
8266160	8268160	probably me
8270160	8272160	probably me
8274160	8276160	because sometimes
8276160	8278160	I don't understand a lot of innuendos
8284160	8286160	between azura and mercy
8286160	8288160	I think
8288160	8290160	it's probably still me
8292160	8294160	it's probably still me
8294160	8296160	it's because
8296160	8298160	it's probably still me because I don't get
8298160	8300160	a lot of innuendos
8302160	8304160	I don't know shibby's been saying you have a lot of hidden powers
8304160	8306160	what the heck has shibby been saying to you
8308160	8310160	I mean I guess
8310160	8312160	I guess
8314160	8316160	in a way
8326160	8328160	I have potential
8332160	8334160	better yet
8334160	8336160	I have potential
8336160	8338160	is that a better way to say it
8340160	8342160	I
8342160	8344160	I
8344160	8346160	I
8346160	8348160	I
8348160	8350160	I
8350160	8352160	I
8352160	8354160	I
8354160	8356160	I
8356160	8358160	I
8358160	8360160	I
8360160	8362160	I
8362160	8364160	I
8364160	8366160	I
8366160	8368160	I
8368160	8391560	probably and second most second most unhinged or like most most not say so
8391560	8398600	would be it's a toss-up between I see and she be
8404280	8409520	like I remember you saying what's a countdown do I say the number it's kind
8409520	8414580	of embarrassing sometimes I'm like I don't know what this means and then I go
8414740	8423100	someone and they like I can feel the literal the literal like face palm as
8423100	8439260	they're typing to me you know and then I go okay yeah it's some okay okay I okay
8439260	8443700	it's something like that then it's something like that then
8453180	8459540	it's okay it's okay I'll learn
8459540	8473020	it's Johnny literally said she's the most say so I don't think Johnny is the
8473020	8480860	most say so I don't think strong is the most say so let's just say that I don't
8480860	8485740	think strong is the most say so because sometimes while we're together she says
8485740	8489660	the most unhinged just things and I just go
8499220	8512020	she just says things and I go okay the moonlight doesn't reach the beast trail
8512500	8520180	the branches off the hiking trail so we're in gloom gloom the trees are thick
8520180	8530620	on both sides and I think her favorite thing she likes to tell me is like I'm
8530620	8543620	so glad we don't have an HR just department the trees are thick on
8543620	8552940	both sides we'd get lost if I didn't have a flashlight just then fuck off
8553780	8564340	there are footsteps close by from the bushes hold on did you hear footsteps
8564340	8575260	too I think strongy is like from like most say so to like I'm say so to these
8575260	8579700	say so strongy is above me because sometimes she can be pretty innocent
8579700	8591740	too I hear footsteps again it better be a fucking dear it better be a motherfucking
8591740	8605700	dear it seems to be getting closer then what okay it's a person
8605700	8624340	corporate slaves spotted salary man spotted a man appears from the bushes he
8624340	8634220	looks horribly exhausted don't start on me like that you should stand around in
8634220	8643100	the dark what are you doing here what are you doing man fall silent I think he
8643100	8649700	realized he already knows the answer we can talk about this we can talk about
8649700	8659580	this nothing scarier than the nine to five I know we can talk about this sir
8659620	8664820	Meshita did say this place is a famous spot for suicide no no no no no wait no

8673980	8684580	bone at a job I don't even want okay fair fair but and you just bring another
8684580	8692100	man home how dare you the nerve he holds his head in his hands he suddenly
8692100	8703740	starts kicking a tree and yelling okay understandable understandable um listen
8703740	8709140	she's not worth it she's not worth it man she's not worth it you know there's
8709140	8714900	tons of fish in the sea heck you can even be another oji-san
8719780	8729660	fuck fuck a rapid stream of swear words flow out of his mouth
8729660	8740700	you seems to be the type that goes crazy when he's upset
8742860	8749380	hey could you tell me how much nerve do you have to do that huh
8753140	8756140	listen I know I know you're going through a hard time I know you're going
8756140	8758980	through a hard time man but like you know this isn't the answer this is in the
8758980	8761380	answer

10746980	10751740	you're like a bit of an asshole like a little bit a lot of an asshole I didn't
10751740	10756420	feel this did I feel it there's the gray marker but nothing's unusual about it
10756420	10763380	other than the graffiti anything else around here
10769380	10776220	okay Jesus Jesus
10777980	10792700	there was a light there wasn't there I go to open the door and my hands get
10792700	10802220	coated with a sticky liquid
10802220	10815500	I smell sweet is it honey
10822700	10825260	Why would there be honey on a doorknob?
10825260	10827180	Mystified, I step inside the cottage.
10831260	10834900	I sure hope as fuck there's nothing here.
10837820	10839180	How about that, it's clean.
10839180	10840780	How about that, it's clean.
10843460	10845260	It's been a night here, easy.
10852700	10862620	I don't like the look of that, that, that bag.
10862620	10866860	Ignore shows rambling and take a good look around the cottage.
10866860	10871260	Not sure why, but something feels off.
10871260	10874260	It takes me two seconds to figure it out.
10875220	10876180	It's too clean.
10886340	10889300	Huh, show looks at me startled.
10890740	10891780	Don't you think it's strange?
10892740	10896500	Why would a building that's been abandoned for so long get this clean inside?
10896900	10898900	Oh.
10909700	10913220	I don't even have to look to know his face just turned three shades whiter.
10914820	10916820	Saying someone lives here?
10919300	10922740	I don't know for sure, but it's possible someone comes here occasionally.
10923620	10931300	That or I immediately start shining my flashlight on places of interest.
10940900	10942740	Maybe I should have brought the cough instead.
10947860	10949060	What do you think's in this bag?
10949860	10950340	Pretty big.
10951220	10952820	How should I know?
10952820	10955940	If you're so interested in it, why don't you open it already?
10957860	10961540	She'll give me the go-ahead, so I open the burlap sack.
10964820	10968500	Before I can stop it, it loses its balance and topples it to the floor.
10969300	10970980	She'll's eyes open wide again.
10970980	10972500	Just a gasp.
10972500	10976500	Ugh.
10976660	10977460	Senpai!
10978500	10979300	Not again!
10981220	10982660	Senpai not done!
10989540	10990420	Hold on.
10990420	10990980	Hold on.
10990980	10991940	Senpai, don't look.
10992820	10993780	Senpai, don't look.
10995140	10996100	Senpai, don't look.
10996100	10996740	Don't look.
10996740	10997860	Don't look, Senpai.
10998580	10999860	Senpai, don't look.
10999860	11002420	I don't even know where to cover first.
11002420	11003540	There, there.
11003540	11014020	YouTube, YouTube, this is fine.
11028420	11036180	While it rolls onto the floor, it's a corpse.
11043220	11043780	A woman.
11048900	11050260	What's with that body?
11051460	11054020	The body is drilled with countless holes.
11058660	11065620	A sharp cylindrical tool must have gouged them.
11069060	11071780	Please, please, please don't tell on me, Senpai.
11074660	11078100	Even otter, her whole body appears to be covered in liquid.
11080180	11083620	Why did, why did you have to say it like that?
11088660	11095860	A thick sweet scent fills the air, strong enough to make you want to cough.
11098980	11100180	Is this honey?
11106100	11106500	Honey?
11108900	11110340	Stop looking, Senpai!
11115140	11116180	On a corpse?
11116180	11116580	Why?
11118820	11119380	Why?
11122500	11124660	He's not really asking me, obviously.
11124660	11125940	There's no way I'd know.
11125940	11127540	Should I've gotten a cough instead?
11127540	11130980	He would handle this much better than a teenager,
11130980	11132820	more technically still in his teens.
11132820	11133540	One more year.
11138740	11140420	I don't like holes either, so.
11142340	11142660	Cool.
11144820	11147780	All I do know is we need to get out of here.
11147860	11148900	As soon as possible.
11150740	11152420	Let's hurry and search the rest of the cottage.
11154660	11155140	What?
11155140	11156260	You're gonna look around?
11167460	11168900	What, what are we gonna do about this?
11169940	11171700	He's not expecting us to take it, is he?
11172980	11174100	Close the bag, put it back.
11174660	11175380	That's all we can do.
11175380	11176500	Come on, help me out.
11178420	11181940	Hey, this isn't the time to be freaking out.
11181940	11183140	Actually, yes it is.
11184020	11185060	Cool, it's freaked out.
11193460	11195700	Sweating profusely, we managed to get the job done.
11197060	11199140	Okay, that was, that was pretty disturbing.
11199140	11199780	Not gonna lie.
11199780	11201620	Yeah, actually, that was pretty, you know.
11203300	11203780	That was...
11205060	11206340	Holes are rough?
11206340	11208340	I told you, Senpai, I hate holes!
11216580	11218500	I still need to search the rest of the cottage.
11219620	11221780	New info was added in the spirit file.
11221780	11222820	Carps in the cottage.
11224980	11226820	What, what was it, trypophobia or something?
11226820	11228420	Yeah, I have trypophobia.
11229140	11229860	I hate it.
11229860	11230980	I hate it so much.
11237140	11240660	Okay, what are these books?
11242180	11242500	Look.
11243620	11245300	Honeybees are our friends.
11245300	11249300	Make them ammoable with medicine from the sprayer.
11250260	11250980	They get mad.
11250980	11253380	Pay attention to the direction the hive is facing.
11254020	11255140	Awaken to honeybees.
11255140	11257220	Leave the hive in the direction of the sun.
11259700	11260100	Go.
11261140	11262260	Honeybees are our friends.
11263060	11263380	No.
11266580	11271060	It looks like something useful.
11271060	11271460	Information.
11271460	11272740	Should I rip it out and take it with me?
11276020	11276740	Burrow the page.
11284420	11287220	Make hive, new body, smear honey all over.
11287220	11290900	Ferment, honey gets stinky, stinky liquid!
11296340	11299780	Thank you for the tip and on.
11299780	11300580	Thank you, Mercy.
11302420	11304340	Oh, and sorry, I missed the super chat.
11304340	11306020	Thank you for the $2 super chat, boy.
11306900	11309060	And welcome to being in my merryuki.
11312900	11313780	Stinky, huh?
11315300	11318500	Gone by smell, honey bee enter hive.
11319460	11320740	Looks like some useful information.
11320740	11322340	Should I rip it out and take it with me?
11322340	11322580	Yeah.
11324580	11325780	I'm going to need to remember that.
11327060	11330980	A bottle of drugs is all in line.
11330980	11332900	Look, the labels say night night.
11333460	11334740	Also, the bottles are empty.
11336500	11339300	I shake each one and luckily find one that still has some left inside.
11340180	11340820	But night night.
11343700	11346340	I remove the lid and look inside, but all I find is dust.
11346340	11347220	Okay, useless.
11350900	11351860	Meadow to a box.
11353140	11353620	Locked.
11353620	11354500	There's no way to open it.
11357300	11358500	Can I feel it?
11361700	11363460	There's thin layer of dust built on the outside.
11363460	11364820	No one has touched it for a long time.
11366820	11367540	I love this one.
11368980	11371860	Peek through the cracks to see if anything's inside, but seems to be empty.
11379060	11379780	Anything else?
11380180	11385060	I flip the switch at the base of the light bulb, but it doesn't turn on.
11385060	11385780	Maybe it's broken.
11390180	11392020	Can we get this later, Senpai?
11396260	11397700	Do you think we're done, Senpai?
11410020	11410980	Save just in case?
11410980	11412340	I don't think I can save here.
11417540	11418900	Boxes in the corner of this one?
11418900	11420900	Oh, they said there was nothing but dust inside.
11431700	11432900	Open the door and let the cabin.
11440580	11441060	Okay.
11447060	11448340	We're going to save scum again.
11453460	11457860	We're going to save scum again because I think we can only save at Kujo Mansion?
11457860	11459060	I don't actually remember.
11470100	11478980	Okay, well, we haven't taken this trail yet.
11482820	11484020	Shut the fuck up!
11486740	11487140	Sorry.
11488900	11493140	As we continue through the dense forest, the pain cries suddenly echoes amongst the trees.
11494660	11495380	Do I have to?
11496580	11497220	Nice hand.
11500020	11501300	There's a pattern on the tree trunk.
11502260	11503860	It's an arm-like pattern on the bark.
11503860	11505380	Is this even a natural occurrence?
11507140	11511540	Look around the tree and find a talisman on the exact opposite side of the tree from the pattern.
11512340	11513780	Yes! A worn-out talisman!
11513780	11514260	We did it!
11520820	11524020	When I pick up the worn-out talisman, I feel warmth flow through me.
11524020	11525540	Give me back my stuff!
11525540	11526500	Thank you!
11526580	11527620	Got soul power.
11527620	11529860	Or now a talisman crumbles silently in my hand.
11534980	11535620	Anything else?
11537940	11538660	Move forward.
11546580	11547460	I don't see anything.
11548980	11549940	Keep moving forward.
11552420	11553620	Wait, is this another one?
11557220	11560740	Look, something's written in Sanskrit.
11560740	11561700	But the letters are blurry.
11561700	11562740	It just looks like a stain.
11564260	11565860	Off to the side, I notice a thin trail.
11567460	11568420	Down the beast trail.
11569620	11570180	Thought so.
11570180	11571300	There's one here too.
11571860	11572660	Come on, let's go.
11574340	11575700	Follow Sho into the bushes.
11578660	11579300	Ugh!
11579300	11580020	Not you again!
11582260	11583540	Sho spots something.
11583620	11586660	Something instumbles, calling backwards onto me.
11586660	11589140	At the same time, every single hair on my body stands on end.
11594660	11595060	Hi!
11602180	11605460	I quickly look down and find a guy!
11607060	11608900	Something is clinging onto my ankle.
11608900	11610420	It's expression anguished.
11611380	11613780	Is this where we tell the opposite?
11613780	11614900	Is this where we lie?
11616340	11618260	It seems eager to speak for me,
11618260	11620900	but his voice is incredibly hard to decipher.
11625940	11630820	This place pitch black.
11633860	11635540	Something can't see anything.
11641140	11642260	I can't see what he is.
11642260	11643300	I don't know what the last one is.
11643300	11643780	What do you think?
11644500	11647300	What do you think that the third word is?
11647300	11649140	The third thingy?
11654580	11655700	What's it saying?
11656500	11656900	Goon?
11659460	11660340	Goon, goon.
11660340	11661540	Okay, okay.
11661540	11662100	Goon.
11670100	11671380	Wait, that grade marker said,
11671380	11672420	say the opposite of the truth.
11672420	11673460	Okay, okay, okay, we're good.
11675220	11676580	But what's the opposite of the truth?
11676580	11678420	Does that mean I'm supposed to lie?
11678420	11678820	Yeah.
11681140	11683220	Live or die.
11685700	11686260	Again, okay.
11687140	11687940	Hey, wait.
11688820	11689220	Are you?
11691620	11692660	Lifeless too?
11697140	11697780	What does that mean?
11701380	11703140	No, no, no, I'm not, right?
11704180	11706020	Oh, wait, yes, we are li-
11706020	11707300	Yes, we are lifeless.
11707300	11709140	Yes, we lie.
11709140	11709460	Yes.
11715700	11716180	I am.
11722500	11724100	It looks sad and lonely.
11727060	11727300	I-
11729620	11730100	Right.
11730100	11730820	Okay, right?
11730820	11732260	Only the dead are here.
11738580	11739060	Safe.
11739060	11741380	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
11742020	11742740	Quick.
11742740	11744420	I hear another voice at my feet.
11746660	11746820	M-
11748020	11749780	M-M-M-I, dead.
11749780	11751060	No, no, you're not dead.
11751940	11752340	Right?
11752340	11755220	No, no, no, no, no, no, you're not.
11755220	11755940	No, no.
11758100	11758420	Oh.
11762260	11762500	Don't-
11763780	11765300	I don't believe it.
11765300	11766180	I don't understand.
11768740	11769540	Am I?
11769540	11770340	Okay, am I?
11772340	11772820	What?
11772820	11773700	You dead?
11773700	11774740	No, no.
11775700	11776260	Tell me.
11776820	11777940	Are you dead?
11777940	11778740	Am I dead?
11778740	11779060	No.
11779860	11780660	No.
11780660	11782660	No, no.
11786180	11787060	Deny it.
11787060	11787620	Yeah.
11787620	11789060	No, no, you?
11789060	11789460	No.
11789460	11790340	Look at you.
11790340	11792900	Look at your pink skin and the soft-
11794020	11795380	soft flushes of your-
11796500	11798020	your- your cheeks.
11798020	11798820	Yeah.
11798820	11799460	Look at you.
11799460	11801460	So much life in your eyes.
11807940	11808500	No, wait.
11808500	11812020	I still have to suffer- suffer.
11814020	11815460	Along with your complexion.
11819140	11820500	It looks sad and lonely.
11822100	11822820	Okay, okay.
11822820	11823860	Another lie.
11823860	11824500	Another lie.
11826260	11828020	I hear yet another voice at my feet.
11831700	11833460	Someone, please listen.
11833460	11841940	I want to live.
11842500	11843540	I want to live.
11843540	11845060	I want to live.
11845060	11845780	Okay.
11845780	11847060	Or is it I want to love?
11848740	11850260	Like, 75s love me, right?
11856900	11858500	I- I'm-
11860740	11861620	I'm alive.
11862420	11862820	Wait.
11863700	11865620	Senpai's help.
11865620	11867460	Do I say, yep, you are alive.
11867460	11868340	Yep, you are.
11871700	11872820	Do I say that?
11872820	11873620	Do I say that?
11873620	11875620	Or do I say the opposite of what they're saying?
11876340	11876740	No, wait.
11876740	11877540	I lie, right?
11878740	11879700	Yep, you sir.
11879700	11880500	You sure are.
11882580	11883380	We need to lie.
11883380	11884260	Yeah, we need to lie.
11884260	11886500	So therefore, we got to go like, oh, yeah.
11886500	11888180	Yeah, you are so alive.
11894420	11897140	Uh, step on the ghost.
11897140	11897700	Not.
11897700	11899220	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're alive.
11899220	11899700	You're alive.
11901620	11902100	That's right.
11902100	11902900	I'm alive.
11902900	11903620	I'm alive.
11904340	11906260	The voice sounds like it passes through me
11906260	11907780	and sucked into the ground.
11910740	11911300	Safe.
11911300	11911620	Woo!
11916260	11917380	The stuff ending.
11918100	11920980	Next thing I know, the shadow clutching at my ankle is gone.
11922020	11922820	Survive.
11922820	11924180	Whoa, we did it, Senpai.
11929460	11931620	Show stands there, his face deathly pale.
11933540	11934340	No way.
11934340	11935300	I saw it.
11935300	11936900	God, it was so clear.
11939300	11940020	It's OK.
11940020	11940660	It's over now.
11941940	11942260	Right.
11944500	11945060	Oh, man.
11946260	11946740	Oh, what?
11947860	11948580	You're awesome.
11953620	11959940	Are we bonding after you said that guy needed to die?
11963380	11964980	Well, he's certainly straightforward.
11967860	11968900	Sure, let's go.
11971380	11971780	Yeah.
11976980	11978820	Is there anything at the end of this footpath?
11979540	11980180	What the hell is this?
11983780	11988980	Look, carefully approach it, but I don't see any bees.
11990660	11992980	Open the box and find a metal tool inside.
11993860	11994580	Got crowbar.
11996420	11997700	Oh, what's this doing here?
11998420	11999140	Why not grab it?
12002820	12004020	I don't think there's anything else.
12005620	12006980	Guess we go through the thing.
12006980	12013140	Step into the empty clearing.
12015140	12017220	The air is filled with buzzing of bees.
12019380	12021700	There appears to be a giant beehive there.
12023620	12026820	This probably wouldn't be right to keep going without doing something about them first.
12028580	12030260	These things are dangerous.
12030820	12031460	Dangerous.
12032500	12033060	Dangerous.
12037220	12041460	Oh, man, don't push your luck.
12042260	12043060	Don't push your luck.
12044740	12046020	You beat a hasty retreat.
12047300	12047700	Shit.
12048660	12054740	OK, so what now?
12059780	12061060	What's the bee note say again?
12062420	12065220	They said, but we need like a spray thingy.
12066100	12066580	Hold on.
12066580	12067860	Let me look at my memos.
12076500	12077940	Oh, Azura.
12079380	12080820	Welcome in Raiders.
12081620	12083460	Welcome, Azura.
12083460	12084340	Welcome to the stream.
12084340	12085060	Hello, Raiders.
12085060	12086420	How was one shot?
12086420	12087300	Did you finish?
12089060	12090340	Azura.
12090340	12091620	Azura.
12091620	12092420	Azura.
12092980	12096420	Azura, did you finish one shot?
12098260	12099220	Welcome, Raiders.
12099220	12100820	Welcome to the stream.
12103620	12104420	You already know me.
12104420	12105620	I'm Mercy Modiste.
12110820	12113940	I've arrived and no, it was much longer than I thought.
12113940	12114580	Oh, OK.
12114580	12115700	Well, you have another stream.
12115700	12116180	Don't worry.
12116820	12117860	Welcome, everyone.
12117860	12120740	Today we are playing a game called Deathmark.
12120740	12124900	It's like a visual novel with some quick time events.
12126020	12126260	Yeah.
12129140	12129460	Yeah.
12129460	12137460	So yeah, it's a visual novel, horror visual novel.
12137460	12137700	Yeah.
12140260	12141060	What's in my bag?
12141060	12141460	Hold on.
12144420	12146980	OK, honey bees are friends.
12146980	12149300	Make them friendly with medicine from the sprayer.
12149300	12152580	If they get mad, pay attention to the direction the hive is facing.
12152580	12153700	Awaken honey bees.
12153700	12155300	Leave the hive in the direction of the sun.
12156580	12158020	Make hive new body smear.
12158020	12158900	Honey all over her.
12158900	12160580	My honey gets stinky like we draw my smile.
12160580	12162340	Honey, enter hive.
12162340	12162580	OK.
12163300	12164740	Can be used with a sprayer.
12164740	12165700	I don't have a sprayer.
12166980	12168260	The goat is going to head to bed.
12168260	12169860	I leave the bleeding hearts in your care.
12169860	12170820	Behave, everyone.
12170820	12172740	OK, thank you, Azura.
12172740	12176500	And if anyone else is tired, yeah.
12177220	12183300	Yeah, feel free to go to bed and just rest up.
12183300	12184180	Thank you.
12184180	12185940	Thank you, Azura, for bringing everyone in.
12191620	12192980	Yeah, behave.
12197380	12198500	Did I miss something?
12203780	12204260	Hold on.
12205060	12207220	Hold on every, every, every senpai.
12214420	12216260	We can't go to the side yet.
12216260	12220660	But I need a bee sprayer or anything.
12222340	12224100	Maybe I missed something at the cottage.
12230500	12233140	I think I missed something at the cottage senpai.
12234820	12235380	Probably.
12238100	12239060	Let's look around again.
12245380	12246500	Open the box with a crowbar.
12246500	12247220	Oh, right.
12248260	12249860	Yes, you are right.
12249860	12250580	You are right.
12250580	12252340	We can probably open it with a crowbar.
12255140	12255860	Anything else?
12262340	12262980	Let's go in.
12264660	12265140	Let's go in.
12273460	12274020	Crowbar.
12275700	12278340	Take out the crowbar and shove it under the lid of the toolbox.
12278340	12279780	I put pressure on it.
12279780	12280660	Use it as a lever.
12282020	12282980	Throw a box prop.
12282980	12283780	It's open.
12283780	12284420	Got a sprayer.
12284420	12284900	We got it.
12285460	12287060	And I can use a variety of drugs.
12290980	12294180	Manipulators will themselves be manipulated.
12295220	12296020	What does this mean?
12300820	12301620	What's that thing?
12306180	12308980	The sun voice makes me jump but I shake it off and turns towards him.
12310100	12312260	It's a tool that sprays chemicals and pesticides.
12313940	12317220	You put the container of drugs in here and then do this.
12318420	12319860	I quickly demonstrate how it works.
12319860	12323460	Shoal scratches his head, his face, and his brow furls.
12324660	12326420	You sure know a lot, oh man.
12332340	12334260	I guess we don't manipulate a person?
12334260	12335380	No more lying, okay.
12340500	12341780	I'll let you handle it then.
12346580	12348260	Now I'm suddenly in charge of it.
12348260	12353620	Well, I want, when I want to spray a drug, I'll have to choose which drug to use.
12355220	12358260	But is this thing really that hard to figure out?
12358260	12359460	I've never seen it before either,
12359460	12361220	but I still know how to use it right away.
12362340	12364020	Uninfo was added to spirit pile.
12364020	12364900	Obtain sprayer.
12366660	12369700	Can I use, oh yeah, wait, this one has nothing in it.
12369700	12372180	Okay, yeah, yeah, Senpai smart.
12372180	12373940	Senpai smart, let's get the fuck out of there.
12380420	12382420	I don't think we're old, but I guess
12382420	12390580	according to Shoal, we're older than him, so I guess that's fine.
12390580	12391460	Okay, we're gonna,
12397860	12399060	we're gonna save scum.
12399060	12401780	Wait, am I not, wait, where am I?
12405700	12406900	Oh, okay, there we go.
12406900	12408260	I know which way I'm facing now.
12412420	12442100	Okay, so now we can use the night knight on, on the bee stuff.
12442900	12444340	Step into the empty clearing.
12446340	12448660	Okay, air is filled with the buzzing of bees.
12448660	12451220	Okay, then appears to be a giant beehive here.
12451860	12454340	Probably wouldn't be wise to keep going without doing something about it first.
12455220	12456100	Oh yeah, there's that.
12457940	12459700	Take out the sprayer and hold in one hand.
12460660	12462340	Should be able to use this to spray drugs.
12463380	12464660	Okay, bag?
12466420	12467300	Or can I just go?
12467380	12472820	Shoal, night knight?
12473460	12475300	Take out the night knight and put in the sprayer.
12483060	12485300	I take careful aim and spray the drug.
12488180	12490020	Oh, I should have been wearing,
12490020	12491780	I should have been wearing goggles for that.
12494900	12496500	The bees movements get slower.
12497300	12501780	Eventually the hive falls completely silent.
12503700	12505460	Mercy, how do you like the game so far?
12505460	12506020	It's great.
12511860	12515140	I think the only time, senpai, where I was, I like,
12516020	12519060	I rage quit like a series.
12519060	12526340	I think was index, where the one character I found out was 15 years old.
12528260	12530740	I should show, show senpai's the character, hold on.
12532340	12534900	I know this is, we're, we're taking a small intermission.
12534900	12536340	I forgot what his name is.
12548180	12548980	Senpai!
12548980	12549620	Senpai!
12551220	12553300	Thank you for this five dollar super chat.
12557860	12559060	I rewatched the stream.
12559060	12561220	My apologies for drunken ramblings.
12561220	12563220	We'll lock up phone next time before I get,
12563220	12565060	I guess very blessed, very unprofessional life.
12565060	12565940	That's okay.
12565940	12566900	It was funny.
12567620	12568420	Hold on.
12568420	12569700	I'm going to save this image.
12570980	12571540	Not a web.
12585140	12586420	I'm going to screenshot this.
12586420	12587540	Hold on senpai.
12587540	12588180	I got this.
12597140	12597860	I got this.
12598900	12600020	I got this senpai.
12606660	12607700	Okay, okay.
12607700	12611300	And then we'll add it to, to as an image file.
12613700	12615140	Careful, don't talk to yourself.
12615140	12617220	I'll, I'll be, I'll be extra careful.
12628100	12631220	And then it should be the last one.
12632500	12633540	This character!
12635700	12637220	This freaking character!
12638020	12639940	Senpai is 15 years old!
12646100	12648340	I like rage quits so hard.
12657060	12658900	I'm like, no fucking way!
12663380	12664260	He's 15.
12664260	12665380	I was like, damn!
12666420	12667460	Are you serious?
12675540	12680500	Wiki says 14, I was even more worse!
12680500	12681540	It's worse than I thought!
12681540	12682660	It's 14!
12682660	12683460	Nevermind!
12685060	12686420	Nevermind, he's 14.
12686420	12687540	That's even worse.
12687540	12689620	I thought, I remembered it completely wrong.
12692980	12694180	No, he's 14.
12694180	12695860	That's totally wrong.
12700420	12702980	Is there some magic or some synapse?
12703300	12705940	Is there some magic or some synanigan involved?
12706900	12707620	No.
12707620	12708740	I don't think so.
12708740	12708980	No.
12711540	12713380	This kid's fucking 14.
12715700	12717140	It has to be a mistranslation, right?
12720420	12722580	Oh, 14 now makes sense.
12722580	12723220	Come on.
12725380	12727220	Anyways, yeah, that's the character.
12727220	12728180	That's the character.
12728740	12730980	I, um, I like kind of rage quit.
12730980	12732500	I might pick it up again, but oh!
12733060	12734420	It just took me out of it.
12734420	12735620	I was like, no way.
12744100	12746580	I like, I was so into it and then that happened.
12746580	12746980	I was like.
12751940	12753140	Oh, I can't do it.
12757620	12759540	It's worse that it's not 15.
12759540	12760500	It's 14.
12760500	12761060	Oh man.
12763460	12764100	It's fine.
12764100	12764580	It's fine.
12764580	12765140	So fine.
12769780	12772500	But yeah, because we were talking about ages.
12774260	12776980	Doesn't the teacher look like an actual child also?
12776980	12781780	I don't remember, but I do remember just being shell shocked by,
12781780	12785700	by this kid and then just going, I can't do this man.
12785860	12793860	Okay, let's continue.
12793860	12794420	Okay.
12794420	12795940	So eventually the hive come.
12795940	12797060	Well, it's completely silent.
12797780	12799460	Used up one bottle of night night.
12803700	12805780	I've silenced every hive in this area.
12805780	12806740	Now we can pass through.
12808020	12808340	Yes.
12808340	12808740	All right.
12812020	12812900	Way to go.
12812900	12813540	Oh man.
12813540	12814260	You got this.
12816260	12819220	Anything else?
12821380	12822100	No spooks.
12830020	12831140	What the fuck was that?
12831700	12832020	Whoa.
12833220	12835140	Did you just hear some kind of animal?
12839220	12841300	I heard it and sounds familiar.
12841300	12843940	Sorry, my stomach does kind of sound like someone's stomach.
12843940	12845940	Huh?
12845940	12848340	I say you wouldn't happen to have any night night yourself.
12849140	12850500	I have a lot of chlorophyll.
12851460	12853060	Farm, chlorophyll, yeah.
12858020	12859540	Oh wait, it's probably the bunny.
12862900	12863460	Turning around.
12863460	12866420	I wonder if it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.
12866420	12867540	It's the bunny.
12867540	12868180	It's bunny.
12869380	12869940	Yep.
12869940	12871380	That rabbit hops in front of me.
12874020	12874820	Evo she be.
12877780	12878980	She be with her tan?
12878980	12880260	Toggle stop.
12887700	12888260	A bunny?
12889700	12892420	The rabbit's scare stares at us completely still.
12892980	12894740	It's almost like it's waiting for us to follow.
12896740	12897300	Hey, wait.
12898980	12900740	The next thing I know, I'm rushing after it.
12902180	12903780	Hey, hey, where do you think you're going?
12903780	12906180	Oh man, rabbit.
12913060	12914260	What's that H elementary?
12914260	12916900	It showed us up and guided us when we were in trouble.
12918500	12919700	Maybe the rabbit is good.
12920340	12922260	We shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
12925620	12927460	That's not some normal rabbit.
12927460	12929060	It's definitely acting with intent.
12929860	12933780	At last, the rabbit guides me too.
12936820	12937860	The fuck is this?
12939300	12941460	An old Shinto Tori gate.
12945460	12947380	It looks evil as shit, Kohai.
12949140	12952980	Well, what do you think I look like then?
12952980	12955140	Do I look evil to you, Senpai?
12959060	12964020	I'm super nice though, right?
12969220	12970820	Yeah, you look more phone friendly.
12970820	12971620	Seriously?
12973780	12974340	Of course not.
12974340	12975220	There's a heart on your face.
12975220	12975700	Broken.
12978900	12980100	Yeah, you look like a lot.
12981540	12982660	Evil but cute.
12982660	12984260	Why not the rabbit then?
12984260	12985220	Why not the rabbit?
12985220	12986420	It looks evil but cute.
12990020	12995540	What, purple and friendly isn't evil?
12995540	12996180	That's good, no?
12996180	12997620	What about a rabbit then?
12997620	12999460	A rabbit's cute, right?
13005540	13007220	There's a shrine here?
13010740	13012020	The rabbit's cute but evil.
13012020	13012820	There's a difference.
13012820	13015940	Okay, evil mercy be like I was supposed to be purple.
13016900	13019380	Purple's royalty and mercy is our queen.
13021380	13022100	Senpai.
13024980	13025860	Thank you Senpai.
13028900	13031620	I call it shadow sheebie, then we should follow it.
13031620	13032660	We should follow it.
13036020	13038180	Anything with red eyes should be instant red flag,
13038180	13038820	except for you.
13038820	13039620	I have red eyes.
13039620	13041540	Yeah, actually, yeah, I do have red eyes.
13042500	13044500	I don't know, it's kind of, yeah, it's red, right?
13046260	13050180	Purple's also the color corruption.
13050180	13050660	What?
13053300	13054660	Senpai, what are you implying?
13069140	13070900	Thank you, Nekohai, for joining.
13071860	13075620	Joining, I'm out of here.
13076420	13077220	Joining them buzz.
13080420	13081620	The rabbit looks back at me,
13083860	13086900	then soundlessly turns, it turns from the gate
13086900	13088580	and hops into a bush nearby.
13091380	13095860	Hey, old man, don't mess with me like that.
13095860	13097700	You're nuts running off like that.
13103380	13105300	The hell's with that bunny anyway?
13106740	13113060	Something's bothering me about it.
13113060	13115780	Sorry, I think that's totally a wrong voice.
13117700	13119060	I lost sight of it here, though.
13120260	13121780	Just then, from out of the darkness.
13125620	13127460	Not the bees!
13127460	13128900	Not the bees!
13131300	13132340	Why, I order.
13135940	13137700	Torrigate kind of messed up, yeah.
13140820	13141860	Bees!
13141860	13144260	A huge swarm of bees is sending us on us.
13144980	13146100	Shit, watch out!
13146100	13148100	There are bees everywhere!
13148660	13150180	And damn, we gotta get out of here.
13152580	13156260	Sho pulls my arm and we stumble back to the earlier crossroad.
13157220	13160500	The info was added to the spirit file, mysterious shrine.
13163700	13164020	Shit.
13166260	13171700	Oh no, there's some rope there.
13171700	13172100	No!
13176660	13178420	Hey, Senpai, which way do we turn?
13180340	13181620	Left or right?
13186180	13186900	Turn around?
13193140	13193700	Right?
13193700	13194020	Okay.
13196340	13202820	The buzzing of bees killed the area.
13202820	13204740	Looks like there's another giant beehive there.
13205300	13208020	Probably wouldn't be wise to keep going without doing something about them first.
13209780	13211540	Take up the sprayer and hold it in one hand.
13212180	13213700	Be able to use spray drugs.
13216580	13220580	I don't think, Senpais, I don't have enough.
13221140	13225860	I don't, I don't think I have any more, more, more night night.
13227460	13228980	Punch the beehive, Mercy.
13229940	13231540	That sounds like a terrible idea.
13231540	13232180	Okay, what about...
13237460	13239460	Oh, okay, we come back to the Torrigate again.
13240820	13243860	Can't you maybe add in a little spray, some drugs on the bees or something?
13244660	13246260	Even the sprayer could calm them down, but...
13248660	13250100	There's a hive above the gate too.
13250580	13251860	There's no way I can spray up there.
13252980	13254260	Damn, I can't do that, huh?
13254260	13256500	But something might be at the shrine.
13258500	13261380	True enough, but that time the rabbit brought me here,
13261380	13262900	it didn't try to go inside the gate.
13263940	13266820	Maybe there's no reason to force our way in.
13268500	13269300	Yeah, okay, bye!
13277220	13278580	Okay, we're driven away.
13278660	13280820	Um, left this time?
13284420	13285780	Another one, okay, no.
13291380	13292740	I don't have enough night night.
13301060	13303300	But these aren't that violent, these ones are.
13305540	13306340	I move forward.
13309540	13311140	Where the hell am I?
13311860	13312900	When did these get here?
13314980	13319220	Look, noticeably dirty as if someone hasn't been here looking after it,
13319220	13320500	and moss is growing on its back.
13322020	13324580	Had around the Giso statue to search it.
13324580	13327140	There's a strange texture on its moss covered backs.
13327140	13330820	When I brush away the moss, I find a yellowed paper stuck to the statue.
13332260	13335540	Found a worn out talisman.
13335540	13337060	When I pick up the worn out talisman,
13337060	13338500	I feel warmth flow through me.
13340980	13341860	Got soul power.
13342580	13352980	Worn out talisman crumbles silently in my hand.
13358580	13361380	There's some sly sliding wooden doors.
13361380	13364340	Look, small crack between the doors.
13364340	13366820	I can only imagine it creates a bad draft.
13368500	13368900	Feel.
13369860	13371780	Lighting door won't open, they seem to be locked.
13373220	13374500	Can I use the crowbar on it?
13376180	13378180	I got the crowbar and jamming into the door.
13379380	13380980	Yeah, yeah, do it!
13380980	13381860	It's the fastest way.
13382820	13383700	Can't break the lock.
13384900	13387860	Or my body weight behind the crowbar two or three times then.
13389380	13390740	There's a sound of metal breaking.
13391620	13392100	What?
13393220	13395060	Crowbar snaps completely into two pieces!
13395940	13396340	Shit.
13398740	13400980	Lost crowbar and got broken crowbar.
13402340	13403860	Too much force, old man.
13403860	13405860	At least the lock up busted too.
13405860	13406180	Good.
13406980	13408340	Hurry it up and look inside.
13409940	13411460	But you're going inside with me, right?
13416180	13417540	You overdid it, man.
13417540	13418260	The door's a mess.
13418260	13419780	You made it even harder to open now.
13420740	13422340	Push the door open and step inside.
13423940	13425220	Only to run into something.
13427300	13428740	Stop, stop!
13428740	13429940	Don't come close, any closer.
13433780	13435780	If you come any closer, I'll sue.
13437060	13439700	A woman has backed up in a defensive stance.
13442100	13444660	I'm a black belt in Taekwondo.
13446260	13448100	Oh, okay, we have a normal woman.
13450740	13457460	If you try anything, Al.
13459140	13460100	Shut up, old lady!
13462180	13463380	Shut up, old lady!
13465220	13466100	Old?
13467140	13472180	At Chills' Roar, the woman treaks and falls silent eyes wide.
13472180	13474340	Incredibly rude, but honestly, I'm grateful.
13474580	13482100	We wait for the woman to calm down before asking what she's doing here.
13488420	13490980	Forgive me, it was all a misunderstanding on my part.
13492660	13496740	I'm Kristi Arimura, freelance news anchor.
13497780	13499300	Oh, I haven't done much recently.
13500740	13501780	Wait, I've seen you!
13501780	13503780	You're the woman that was in the news!
13504420	13505460	Wow, that's really true!
13505460	13507540	Celebrity is on a more beautiful person!
13517220	13519540	Get that out, this isn't the time for flattery.
13522580	13525060	She says that, but she doesn't sound that upset.
13526340	13527940	She seems to love being complimented.
13528500	13530580	Speaking of senpai...
13530980	13534980	Oh, where's my compliment?
13547700	13548820	Kohai's cute, yay!
13550260	13551300	Best Kohai.
13551300	13552740	Beautiful mercy, yeah.
13558180	13559380	Yeah, that's the stuff.
13560580	13565380	Thank you, thank you senpai!
13579700	13580580	Yay!
13580580	13582580	Aww, senpais!
13582580	13583940	Senpais are so nice to me.
13584500	13585540	Yay, thank you!
13585860	13592740	Um, anyway, what are you doing here?
13595700	13596900	Your expression clouds over.
13598340	13600820	Well, feel huffed at me.
13602020	13603460	You really have to ask!
13605300	13607300	You lost your tack in your old age!
13612180	13614260	Masao Kimura's face comes to mind.
13616500	13618260	That's right, this place is...
13621620	13622900	I was going to die.
13626900	13629380	Yes, I know, full well just how stupid that is.
13630180	13632580	But sometimes that's the only choice you have left.
13633940	13637540	I shouldn't have known better of such a thoughtless question past my lips.
13638100	13640260	Wow, we really have no riz.
13640820	13642020	Zero, none!
13645540	13659860	It's a woman, so you know how to de-escalate, right?
13659860	13660180	No!
13664020	13666260	We are so riz-less senpais.
13667380	13668180	How could we?
13668260	13676500	I wish I could blame the mark for this.
13677860	13681060	Oh yeah, I heard something about you fooling around with another celebrity.
13684900	13688660	Like, is call- is- is call-hi-mercy?
13688660	13689300	Riz-less?
13689300	13691060	No, we are riz-less.
13693460	13694980	Not that I care about that stuff.
13695700	13700420	That's why I came out here, so I wouldn't cause trouble for anyone.
13705380	13708580	At the very end, I thought about calling someone, but couldn't so...
13712260	13713140	I made up my mind.
13713700	13715140	But- but then in the forest...
13716260	13717460	I have a bad feeling about this.
13721140	13723700	What was... in the forest?
13725620	13729220	A huge man.
13729220	13730980	An extremely huge man.
13733620	13736820	I don't know, I'm not even sure if he was really human or not.
13738820	13740980	But I saw a figure like that.
13740980	13742100	I suddenly got scared.
13743140	13744340	I ran into this cottage.
13745140	13747300	I'm here to kill myself and I just run from danger.
13747300	13748020	I'm a riot.
13751700	13753060	What- what's wrong?
13753060	13754340	You two aren't saying anything.
13755940	13758020	That's the same as what I-
13759460	13759700	Yeah.
13761060	13762500	Christy must have seen shimmy-o.
13763140	13764420	Which means she must also.
13765860	13767460	You got in a weird scar recently.
13772180	13773780	One that stings every now and then.
13777300	13779140	I know the answer just from her reaction.
13780660	13781300	How'd you know?
13782420	13784020	I- I only just noticed it myself.
13784100	13786020	There's a strange bite mark on my palm.
13789780	13790660	This is crazy.
13792980	13795860	Someone receives the mark when they're already planning suicide.
13795860	13797700	The height of irony.
13801380	13803300	Hey old man, what are we supposed to do now?
13803860	13806260	That lady came to offer self, you know?
13807060	13808340	There any point in helping her?
13809300	13811620	Well, what if she changed her mind?
13811620	13812100	Shut up!
13814980	13815860	Help me!
13815860	13817300	I'm not going to kill myself anymore.
13817300	13819380	I swear, so please, I'm terrified of him.
13821860	13822820	Her eyes are serious.
13822820	13824020	She must mean what she says.
13824900	13826980	I only be a temporary change of heart, but...
13828260	13829460	Alright, we'll help you.
13830500	13832100	Our home base is Kujo Mansion.
13832100	13832900	You need to go.
13841620	13843220	Stop messing with the flies!
13844020	13844740	Ashlight, old man!
13849300	13849940	Sampai!
13854740	13855460	What's happening?
13858820	13859300	Sampai's...
13860420	13861140	We might be...
13862020	13862980	We're in thwobble.
13864180	13865060	I'm in danger!
13868820	13869700	Well, I won't turn on.
13874020	13876020	What's happened before about back then?
13884020	13886020	I got it to go back on right away.
13888020	13890020	Aaaaaaahhh!
13894020	13896020	I got it to go back on right away.
13898020	13900020	Aaaaaaahhh!
13904980	13906020	But this time, it's not working.
13908020	13908980	Aaaaaaahhh!
13910020	13910820	What was that?
13914020	13916020	Aaaaaaahhh!
13918020	13920020	No, I'm from behind the cottage!
13920020	13922020	Is something there?
13922020	13924020	Shit, there's no use.
13924020	13928020	I gave up on the flashlight and stuff it in my bag.
13928020	13929020	What's the plan now?
13929020	13930020	Do we bunker down in this cottage?
13930020	13931020	We can't even lie.
13931020	13933020	We have to run out of the forest.
13935020	13937020	Are you insane?
13943020	13945020	This day here will be suicide.
13947020	13949020	This place is strangely clean.
13949020	13951020	That means someone is coming here.
13951020	13953020	I mean, she comes here?
13953020	13955020	Let's go. We walked all the way here.
13955020	13957020	We should know how to get back.
13959020	13961020	You're seriously going? Are you mad?
13961020	13963020	Sorry, but we're out of time.
13963020	13965020	Stay here if you want. I won't stop you.
13965020	13967020	Aaaaaaahhh!
13969020	13971020	Step out of pitch-clackness.
13971020	13973020	Damn it, I can hardly see.
13973020	13975020	We need to go straight.
13975020	13977020	We need to get out of here.
13977020	13979020	Step out of pitch-clackness.
13979020	13981020	Damn it, I can hardly see.
13981020	13983020	We need to go straight back
13983020	13985020	to the entrance with no detours.
13997020	14001020	I was lost on the way here, so...
14003020	14005020	I don't know.
14007020	14009020	Not as bad as you think it is.
14009020	14011020	Ah, shit.
14013020	14015020	We've got no idea where he could be waiting.
14017020	14019020	You remember the way, right, Mercy?
14019020	14021020	I got lost in the middle.
14027020	14029020	Where's Leemina Rush?
14029020	14031020	I hadn't split them out.
14031020	14033020	I would never finish.
14033020	14035020	My voice is starting to shake too much.
14035020	14037020	Maybe I should save before we're in an entire spot.
14037020	14039020	Can I save?
14039020	14041020	I'm not at the mansion!
14045020	14047020	New info was added to the spirit file.
14047020	14049020	A markbearer in a cottage.
14065020	14067020	Okay.
14067020	14069020	Back.
14073020	14075020	We're at a fork already.
14085020	14087020	Which way?
14087020	14089020	Where do we go?
14091020	14093020	I don't remember, Senpai.
14095020	14097020	Was it...
14099020	14101020	Was it forward?
14103020	14105020	Left?
14105020	14107020	I don't know if that's right.
14113020	14115020	Maybe it is left?
14115020	14117020	I think right is the tori gate.
14117020	14119020	Left was a bee path.
14119020	14121020	Would it be forward then?
14121020	14123020	Forward then?
14123020	14125020	Oh my gosh.
14125020	14127020	Can you read the map?
14131020	14133020	I think east.
14133020	14135020	We came from the east.
14137020	14139020	Never... Which way is east?
14145020	14147020	Right, okay.
14147020	14149020	Okay.
14149020	14151020	Yeah!
14151020	14153020	Don't yell, lady!
14153020	14155020	Don't yell, lady!
14155020	14157020	Something's coming closer.
14157020	14159020	We need to get out of here fast.
14159020	14161020	Uh...
14161020	14163020	East?
14163020	14165020	Forward.
14165020	14167020	Another fork?
14167020	14169020	Which way this time?
14169020	14171020	South. It's south!
14171020	14173020	The exit should be straight ahead from there.
14175020	14177020	Quiet.
14179020	14183020	Something's passing through the bushes right by us.
14185020	14187020	Now the game tells us that's good.
14195020	14197020	Is he following us?
14197020	14199020	Even if he was, he is.
14199020	14201020	We have to keep going.
14201020	14205020	That's no way we can just stand around anymore!
14205020	14207020	Right, let's go!
14209020	14211020	Move around.
14213020	14215020	Move forward.
14215020	14217020	Move forward.
14219020	14221020	Wait a second.
14221020	14223020	No, wait a second.
14223020	14225020	I see something stops.
14225020	14227020	What's wrong?
14227020	14229020	What's coming?
14229020	14231020	I'm telling you, someone's coming.
14233020	14235020	Not from the darkness jumps.
14235020	14237020	Mashita!
14245020	14247020	So this is where you were.
14247020	14249020	You're closer than I thought.
14253020	14255020	Wait, why are you here?
14257020	14261020	I had a bad feeling, so I grabbed a car and made my way here.
14261020	14263020	Looks like you're in an erupt spot.
14265020	14267020	Can you say that again?
14267020	14269020	Anyway, we're on our way back.
14269020	14271020	Good plan.
14271020	14273020	Mashita glances over at Christie.
14273020	14275020	Run! Run now!
14275020	14277020	Explain later! We gotta get out of here!
14283020	14285020	We reach the entrance safe and sound.
14285020	14289020	The creepy murderer on the Ark is such a familiar sight now.
14289020	14293020	Alright, if we made it this far, then we must be...
14293020	14295020	Yeah, it's all good now.
14301020	14303020	Christie doesn't move.
14303020	14305020	She looks worried, staring off into the forest entrance.
14307020	14309020	What's wrong?
14311020	14313020	Over there.
14313020	14315020	Doesn't it look like someone's there?
14317020	14319020	She's looking at the picnic table, hiding in the gloom next to the gate.
14319020	14321020	The gaze is drawn over as if by magnets.
14323020	14325020	What is...
14325020	14327020	No!
14329020	14331020	No, we just saved him!
14331020	14333020	No!
14335020	14337020	Is he having a beer?
14343020	14345020	What is that?
14347020	14349020	The scene before me is strange.
14349020	14351020	No!
14353020	14355020	Wait, is he having a beer too?
14355020	14357020	Are they drinking beer together?
14357020	14359020	That's kind of nice, but also...
14363020	14365020	We just saved him!
14365020	14367020	He was gonna have a drink with us!
14373020	14377020	The huge misshapen man with beads crawling all over his face.
14377020	14379020	The eyes fixate on his mouth.
14379020	14381020	Looks like he's laughing.
14383020	14385020	My heart thunders painfully,
14385020	14389020	and I catch a glimpse of the limp figure sitting beside him.
14393020	14395020	It's him, that man.
14395020	14397020	He's going to commit suicide.
14397020	14399020	Masao Kimura, it's definitely him.
14409020	14411020	Control those that are different in exercise.
14413020	14415020	That strange voice echoes in my head again.
14415020	14417020	My vision warps.
14417020	14419020	He's dead?
14419020	14421020	Kimura's dead?
14421020	14423020	What? Why is he on that bench?
14425020	14427020	My legs give out when I finally focus enough.
14427020	14429020	I find myself kneeling on the ground.
14431020	14433020	Oh man, keep it together!
14433020	14435020	It's still okay, he hasn't seen us!
14439020	14441020	We have to escape while we can.
14441020	14443020	You see, he's completely out of it.
14443020	14445020	She won't move an inch unless someone drags her.
14447020	14449020	Let's go.
14449020	14451020	We're going to the parking lot.
14453020	14455020	You bring her.
14455020	14457020	You got it!
14459020	14461020	Come on, Mashita, let's go.
14465020	14467020	Mashita?
14467020	14469020	Mashita?
14471020	14473020	He's gone.
14473020	14475020	Took my eyes off him for two seconds
14475020	14477020	and he's not by the bench anymore.
14481020	14483020	The machine growls
14483020	14485020	and the undergrowth near us rustles.
14487020	14489020	Yeah, he's right there!
14489020	14491020	Run!
14491020	14493020	Mashita yells, scrambling away.
14493020	14495020	The hollow
14495020	14497020	bang rings out from behind me.
14497020	14499020	A gunshot?
14499020	14501020	Must be Mashita.
14501020	14503020	I had no idea he had a gun.
14505020	14507020	I dive head first into the car,
14507020	14509020	slamming my head accidentally into the steering wheel.
14511020	14513020	Mashita tumbles into the passenger's
14513020	14515020	seat last.
14517020	14519020	He didn't tell me he had a gun.
14519020	14521020	Why would I tell you? No time to talk now.
14521020	14523020	Just hit the gas.
14523020	14525020	I'm trying!
14525020	14527020	Engine won't start.
14527020	14529020	Shit, shit.
14529020	14531020	Oh, oh man, what are you doing?
14531020	14533020	Mashita looks through the front windshield
14533020	14535020	at the figure approaching.
14535020	14537020	Hurry it up, he's coming!
14537020	14539020	Shoot, shoot, shoot!
14539020	14541020	Shoot the fucking shit!
14541020	14543020	Shoot, shoot it!
14543020	14545020	Shoot the fucking thing!
14545020	14547020	Wait, Christy cowards in the back seat
14547020	14549020	her head and her hands.
14549020	14551020	He's gone.
14553020	14555020	Something bombed the hood of the car,
14555020	14557020	the whole vehicle rocked violently.
14557020	14559020	Then...
14559020	14561020	it turned on.
14563020	14565020	Go, let's get the hell out of here!
14569020	14571020	Tire squealing, we race out of the parking lot.
14579020	14581020	An unspeakable sense of relief
14581020	14583020	fills the car.
14585020	14587020	If feeling truly alive
14587020	14589020	is a real sensation,
14589020	14591020	then it most definitely feels like this.
14593020	14595020	Where sees Toyota did it?
14595020	14597020	My car would never,
14597020	14599020	unless it's winter,
14599020	14601020	would never not start.
14603020	14605020	The greatest irony is that the only time
14605020	14607020	you can feel truly alive
14607020	14609020	is when you have a brush with death.
14611020	14613020	No one speaks for a while,
14613020	14615020	we're all soaking in that feeling.
14619020	14621020	Why is it more cooperative in winter?
14621020	14623020	It's uncooperative in winter,
14623020	14625020	so...
14625020	14627020	So it can
14627020	14629020	have trouble starting in winter
14629020	14631020	and you have to probably jump start it.
14633020	14635020	Yeah.
14637020	14639020	It's just a problem for everyone.
14641020	14643020	It's only after we've left the mountain
14643020	14645020	and reached buildings again that I feel like talking.
14647020	14649020	Still,
14649020	14651020	I glance through the rear view mirror
14651020	14653020	and then at the passenger seat,
14653020	14655020	both Maschita and Sho are looking out their windows.
14657020	14659020	Is it really okay for you to come here?
14659020	14661020	Mary finds out.
14661020	14663020	Obviously I came with her permission.
14667020	14669020	Maschita immediately retorts.
14669020	14671020	If I hadn't,
14671020	14673020	I wouldn't have come.
14673020	14675020	I get it.
14675020	14677020	Mary must have also guessed that we were in danger.
14679020	14681020	So,
14681020	14683020	what happened to that ex...
14683020	14685020	So what happened to that explanation?
14685020	14687020	Who's that woman behind us?
14687020	14689020	Alright.
14689020	14691020	I tell him everything I know so far
14691020	14693020	about Christy Adimura.
14693020	14695020	She offers up some details as well.
14695020	14697020	The moment her background comes to light,
14697020	14699020	Maschita smiles coldly.
14699020	14701020	Adimura?
14701020	14703020	Right now that you mentioned it,
14703020	14705020	I do remember you.
14707020	14709020	Oh yeah.
14709020	14711020	Thank goodness Maschita was there
14711020	14713020	and thank goodness he has a gun!
14717020	14719020	We're fired over that scandal.
14721020	14723020	Why? I never...
14723020	14725020	Can I be disgusted or amazed at his rudeness?
14729020	14731020	But these scars you...
14731020	14733020	But these scars you all had.
14733020	14735020	What are they called?
14735020	14737020	Marks.
14737020	14739020	Thanks. So, all of you have these marks.
14741020	14743020	What happens when you have one?
14743020	14745020	Well...
14747020	14749020	Maschita butts in from the passenger seat.
14749020	14751020	You die within a few days time.
14753020	14755020	Suffering from something like amnesia.
14755020	14757020	You zone out. Your brain takes a vacation.
14757020	14759020	It all happened to me.
14761020	14763020	Show scoffs.
14763020	14765020	You talk like it's someone else's problem.
14767020	14769020	Maschita didn't mean it like that.
14769020	14771020	You can only be blunt when discussing this.
14773020	14775020	Doesn't look like show will buy that excuse though.
14779020	14781020	Yes. Yes, it's really not your problem.
14781020	14783020	After all, you don't have a mark anymore.
14785020	14787020	Oh. What's he talking about?
14787020	14789020	Oh, well, you see...
14789020	14791020	Maschita has already lost
14791020	14793020	Hanna Hiko's mark. He's free now.
14797020	14799020	So, there's no good reason for him
14799020	14801020	to be here with us, but...
14801020	14803020	You're putting yourself...
14805020	14807020	In danger for the truth?
14807020	14809020	I can't believe it. You're like a saint.
14809020	14811020	Wait.
14811020	14813020	You're putting yourself out there for the truth?
14813020	14815020	You're like a saint.
14815020	14816020	There you go.
14816020	14817020	Christie's exaggerated compliment
14817020	14819020	is drowned out by Maschita's sardonic laugh.
14819020	14821020	It's nothing that noble.
14823020	14825020	But thanks to that,
14825020	14827020	I've learned the thing I want...
14827020	14829020	I most wanted to know.
14829020	14831020	And what's that?
14831020	14833020	When and how people get that mark.
14839020	14841020	The first time I was oblivious,
14841020	14843020	but this time,
14843020	14845020	I was aware of it.
14845020	14847020	Does he have it again?
14849020	14851020	Maschita, you don't mean...
14855020	14857020	He gives me his usual crooked smile.
14857020	14859020	Grannon shows me his wrist.
14859020	14861020	Sure enough, his skin is blemished by a scar
14861020	14863020	that looks like a spirit's bite mark.
14865020	14867020	Show cries out a look of horror on his face.
14867020	14869020	Come on, no way.
14869020	14871020	Do you seriously do that?
14873020	14875020	Man, give it up already.
14875020	14877020	It's someone else's problem, right?
14877020	14879020	So just shut it.
14881020	14883020	After everything.
14883020	14885020	After everything.
14885020	14887020	We did.
14887020	14889020	He's like, I got it again, just to see
14889020	14891020	how you get one.
14891020	14893020	Maschita, could I say something?
14893020	14895020	What's wrong?
14895020	14897020	What's wrong?
14897020	14899020	Nothing's wrong.
14899020	14901020	You never told me you had a gun.
14901020	14903020	Oh, that.
14903020	14905020	He laughs scornfully
14905020	14907020	and shoves a paper bag into my hands.
14907020	14909020	I open the bag and find
14909020	14911020	a revolver-style handgun
14911020	14913020	at the bottom.
14915020	14917020	If you want it taken.
14917020	14919020	That's not why I
14919020	14921020	Maschita keeps on talking
14921020	14923020	without stopping to hear what I have to say.
14923020	14925020	It's loaded with five bullets.
14925020	14927020	You can hang on to it.
14927020	14929020	I promise.
14929020	14931020	I promise you what.
14931020	14933020	Don't use it on anything other than a spirit.
14933020	14935020	Not that there's any proof
14935020	14937020	it will work on them.
14937020	14939020	We got a gun!
14941020	14943020	We, I think, I think
14943020	14945020	our main character
14945020	14947020	and he should kiss. Yes, I believe so.
14947020	14949020	No.
14953020	14955020	Of course.
14955020	14957020	I have any experience with guns.
14957020	14959020	There's no way I would.
14959020	14961020	To be fair,
14961020	14963020	I really, I don't really know.
14963020	14965020	But at the very least, right now,
14965020	14967020	I'm not getting the feeling that I can handle a gun.
14969020	14971020	But, MC is Senpai.
14971020	14973020	Well, Senpai, alternate route, okay?
14973020	14975020	This is like, uh, what is it?
14975020	14977020	Alternate reality, okay?
14977020	14979020	We can write fan fiction!
14983020	14985020	Oh.
14995020	14997020	Only use it under extreme stress.
14997020	14999020	With no experience, you will hit your mark.
14999020	15001020	Well, whatever. If I'm there,
15001020	15003020	just leave the shooting to me.
15003020	15005020	You can face the spirit some other way.
15005020	15007020	Yeah, that's how
15007020	15009020	it was in elementary two.
15013020	15015020	And for God's sake,
15015020	15017020	keep it.
15017020	15019020	Gun possession gets you three years
15019020	15021020	penal labor.
15021020	15023020	I'll get hit with one
15023020	15025020	to ten myself just for giving it to you.
15025020	15027020	And shooting a single bullet
15027020	15029020	will get you more than three years,
15029020	15031020	if not a life sentence.
15032020	15034020	Damn, gun laws in Japan, huh?
15039020	15041020	Is that how you're telling me not to use it?
15043020	15045020	No, I'm telling you that if it's restricted
15045020	15047020	that badly by the law,
15047020	15049020	it's got that kind of power.
15053020	15055020	Got a handgun.
15055020	15057020	Mark?
15057020	15059020	This color grows more vivid.
15059020	15061020	A few hours left
15061020	15063020	till death closes in.
15071020	15073020	Welcome back,
15073020	15075020	Lord Darling.
15075020	15077020	At least I can save now, yeah.
15077020	15079020	And I think,
15079020	15081020	I think we're good.
15081020	15083020	I think we're good.
15083020	15085020	I think we're good, Senpai.
15085020	15087020	That's a lot of excitement.
15087020	15089020	I think that's a good place to
15089020	15091020	to stop at. What do you think, Senpai?
15095020	15097020	You as well, Lord Cho.
15097020	15099020	It appears that the woman with you
15099020	15101020	is also a markbearer.
15105020	15107020	We introduce Christy
15107020	15109020	and then Mary.
15109020	15111020	Christy is to fill her in on everything.
15111020	15113020	Is this the first stream of this game?
15113020	15115020	Um, I have one more
15115020	15117020	one more
15117020	15119020	before this, where I kind of
15119020	15121020	yapped a lot more.
15121020	15123020	I yapped a whole lot.
15127020	15129020	A mark after your life.
15129020	15131020	Memory, loss,
15131020	15133020	and the spirits who curse them into the living.
15137020	15139020	Feels like a chapter just ended, right?
15141020	15143020	Christy accepts her new reality
15143020	15145020	surprisingly quickly. Guess it's only natural
15145020	15147020	after what she saw in the forest.
15147020	15149020	I then update Mary on what we found.
15151020	15153020	I see. What a close call
15153020	15155020	for you.
15155020	15157020	I can hear relief in her voice,
15157020	15159020	but why did she let Mashita go?
15159020	15161020	If you must know
15161020	15163020	after you left,
15163020	15165020	Lord Mashita insisted on traveling
15165020	15167020	to the forest as well.
15167020	15169020	Her eyes look over to Mashita.
15169020	15171020	I'm not
15171020	15173020	I'm not one to just sit around.
15173020	15175020	Mashita shrugs nonchalantly.
15177020	15179020	But there, yeah, though
15179020	15181020	there are one before this was mostly
15181020	15183020	me yapping and doing a bit
15183020	15185020	of the first chapter. We finished
15185020	15187020	the first chapter
15187020	15189020	in the stream and then we started the second
15189020	15191020	chapter. So we're still kind
15191020	15193020	of in the beginning of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
15193020	15195020	Yeah.
15197020	15199020	I'm glad everyone's enjoying
15199020	15201020	this. I thought at first people would
15201020	15203020	find this kind of boring, but
15203020	15205020	but I'm glad that everyone's
15205020	15207020	like enjoying it now.
15213020	15215020	It was it was quite the issue.
15217020	15219020	A selfish attitude like that could
15219020	15221020	get all of you, Mark Barris killed.
15223020	15225020	I normally
15225020	15227020	would have refused.
15229020	15231020	Did something
15231020	15233020	happen? No.
15233020	15235020	I admit I had a foreboding
15235020	15237020	feeling. I sense danger
15237020	15239020	was closing in on you, Lord
15239020	15241020	Darling. So he went
15241020	15243020	an emergency measure.
15245020	15247020	Lord Mashita
15247020	15249020	please know I will not allow
15249020	15251020	such a thing a second time.
15251020	15253020	Her cool voice is spicier
15253020	15255020	than you. Mashita's
15255020	15257020	so hard headed. I wonder if she's actually getting
15257020	15259020	through to him at all.
15259020	15261020	Now, from what you've told me
15263020	15265020	you are positive that it was
15265020	15267020	Chimio who gave Lord Cho his mark.
15269020	15271020	Yeah, yeah
15271020	15273020	that ugly monster is definitely the
15273020	15275020	huge man I saw that time.
15275020	15277020	The fact that I have the mark
15277020	15279020	now to prove it.
15279020	15281020	Mashita rubs at its wrists
15281020	15283020	smirking.
15285020	15287020	So, what exactly
15287020	15289020	are you planning? Don't tell
15289020	15291020	me you're seriously thinking of fighting that thing.
15291020	15293020	There's no way you'd win.
15293020	15295020	You're completely mad if you think you can.
15297020	15299020	She's right. A certain someone awesome.
15299020	15301020	Someone's awesome bullet didn't
15301020	15303020	even scratch it. We need
15303020	15305020	a tank or something to beat that thing.
15309020	15311020	The room fall silent.
15317020	15319020	I'm sure all of us are thinking about what
15319020	15321020	we saw back at the forest.
15321020	15323020	I feel so bad for
15323020	15325020	Kimura.
15325020	15327020	There's no way we can do anything
15327020	15329020	about a monster like that.
15329020	15331020	You have to leave it to the police.
15333020	15335020	You honestly believe they'll do something.
15335020	15337020	Go
15337020	15339020	and make a suicide pack
15339020	15341020	with that naive thinking.
15341020	15343020	Believe me out of it.
15343020	15345020	What? How dare you?
15345020	15347020	No boss.
15347020	15349020	This is all high and mighty talk
15349020	15351020	coming from you? That mean
15351020	15353020	you got an idea how to beat it?
15353020	15355020	How the hell would
15355020	15357020	I know that?
15357020	15359020	When I'm willing to risk my life to find one.
15359020	15361020	The shout is
15361020	15363020	horse. Probably uneasy.
15363020	15365020	Christy shivers.
15365020	15367020	So it just glares up Machita.
15367020	15369020	Not where silence falls again.
15369020	15371020	What are the police going to do?
15371020	15373020	The police will just be like
15373020	15375020	yeah sure whatever.
15375020	15377020	Or die like the
15377020	15379020	the freaking
15379020	15381020	do you remember the
15381020	15383020	the guard?
15383020	15385020	Yeah probably not.
15387020	15389020	We're wasting
15389020	15391020	time. And Machita
15391020	15393020	is the police.
15393020	15395020	We've got to do something
15395020	15397020	but
15403020	15405020	What do we do
15405020	15407020	Senpai? Do we just
15407020	15409020	turn to Mary?
15413020	15415020	I'll turn to Mary. I'll be like
15417020	15419020	Take charge?
15421020	15423020	I don't know. I need more information.
15425020	15427020	You want to wear the pants
15427020	15429020	and take charge or let Mary handle it?
15429020	15431020	Well I want Mary's opinion.
15433020	15435020	Pull time? Be dummy?
15435020	15437020	No I don't want
15437020	15439020	We beat a ghost already. Okay
15439020	15441020	True.
15441020	15443020	True.
15443020	15445020	Maybe she can give us more hints.
15445020	15447020	I thought Mary could give us more
15447020	15449020	hints.
15451020	15453020	Show to us we're awesome.
15453020	15455020	Has he been wrong yet?
15457020	15459020	Being too reliant
15459020	15461020	will make us look weak. Okay fine.
15461020	15463020	Fine. Fine.
15463020	15465020	I saw majority B1 anyways.
15465020	15467020	Fine. Fine. We take charge.
15467020	15469020	Fuck it.
15469020	15471020	We need to force everyone into action.
15471020	15473020	You can think about what we need to do
15473020	15475020	while we're walking around.
15475020	15477020	Of course.
15477020	15479020	We need to take charge.
15479020	15481020	We're walking around.
15481020	15483020	Going back to the forest.
15485020	15487020	I want to learn more about Shemeal.
15487020	15489020	I could use some help.
15489020	15491020	You say that but
15491020	15493020	no way we can find a needle in a haystack.
15495020	15497020	Pants equipped.
15497020	15499020	We gotta have a clue first.
15503020	15505020	Then why don't we check out the B farm
15505020	15507020	that's north of H tribe?
15507020	15509020	My reports say several people have seen
15509020	15511020	Shemeal there.
15511020	15513020	Hardly anyone ever goes there now
15513020	15515020	with the weird events in the forest.
15515020	15517020	Why is a B farm up there?
15519020	15521020	A cult called Honey B Family
15521020	15523020	used to live on the land.
15523020	15525020	Oh my gosh! A cult!
15527020	15529020	No one's there though.
15529020	15531020	No one's there anymore though.
15531020	15533020	How come?
15533020	15535020	They
15535020	15537020	committed mass suicide.
15541020	15543020	Mass suicide in the woods.
15543020	15545020	I've heard about it somewhere.
15545020	15547020	It's always a cult, huh?
15547020	15549020	I should have mentioned something similar
15549020	15551020	before we entered the forest.
15553020	15555020	Shemeal is obviously a member.
15555020	15557020	Maybe the leader, perhaps?
15559020	15561020	Tabloids and gossip shows ate it
15561020	15563020	up five years ago.
15563020	15565020	I've never reviewed the details though,
15565020	15567020	so the public doesn't know.
15571020	15573020	Oh yeah, I remember that.
15573020	15575020	But my club took up all my time
15575020	15577020	back then, so I don't know much.
15579020	15581020	You seem to know quite a bit about the forest,
15581020	15583020	Christie Ari Mora.
15583020	15585020	Read up on it to find a Primo spot.
15587020	15589020	Don't be an ass.
15589020	15591020	I was put in charge of the report,
15591020	15593020	and the search.
15597020	15599020	Honeybee Family was very
15599020	15601020	insular and secretive.
15601020	15603020	I heard the mass suicide in
15603020	15605020	was all the members following their leader.
15605020	15607020	Nudes channels chalked it up
15607020	15609020	to their discontent with modern society.
15609020	15611020	What happened to the leader?
15611020	15613020	Rumors say it was also suicide.
15615020	15617020	Though, I saw an old picture of him in.
15617020	15619020	He was a huge,
15619020	15621020	obese man. It's him! It's him!
15621020	15623020	I called it!
15629020	15631020	Suddenly, everyone is holding their breath.
15631020	15633020	No doubt, we're picturing the same thing.
15635020	15637020	The monster at the forest entrance.
15639020	15641020	A dead guy's come back to life?
15645020	15647020	We want to go to a place
15647020	15649020	with a zombie? That's totally insane!
15651020	15653020	It's just like the rumors.
15653020	15655020	It's just like the rumors say that forest
15655020	15657020	is correct. There's no way I could
15657020	15659020	just standing there, the voices
15659020	15661020	of suicide victims surrounded me.
15661020	15663020	Shut the hell up, Hank!
15663020	15665020	No more words out of those
15665020	15667020	lip flaps!
15667020	15669020	Oh!
15675020	15677020	Why is he like this?
15685020	15687020	Why is he like this?
15687020	15689020	Rude.
15691020	15693020	But now it's not
15693020	15695020	only the forest thus cursed.
15695020	15697020	I failed to kill myself and now I'm in
15697020	15699020	this mansion. I'm cursed too.
15701020	15703020	And so all of
15703020	15705020	her mutters have a dark edge.
15707020	15709020	Shimeo is somehow connected to
15709020	15711020	Honey Bee family, and the key
15711020	15713020	to destroying his grudge is going to be there.
15715020	15717020	Alright, what are you going to do, old lady?
15717020	15719020	You still want to die?
15719020	15721020	I'm considering it.
15725020	15727020	Hahaha.
15727020	15729020	But I'll help you guys
15729020	15731020	while I settle on my decision.
15731020	15733020	I'll pass on monster fighting.
15735020	15737020	Well, you'll help. I'm shocked.
15741020	15743020	If you leave your mark alone,
15743020	15745020	you won't need to hike back out there.
15747020	15749020	Oh, I hate owning strangers.
15749020	15751020	Especially pushy guys like you.
15751020	15753020	He seems grateful that we saved her.
15755020	15757020	There's no reason to refuse her help.
15757020	15759020	We need as much as we can get.
15759020	15761020	She is pretty sane though.
15761020	15763020	Why is everyone in this game so negative?
15763020	15765020	Well, everyone's about to die.
15767020	15769020	You know, I think that's a pretty good reason.
15769020	15771020	Hahaha.
15781020	15783020	Lady Christy said Shimeo
15783020	15785020	was often seen near the bee farm.
15785020	15787020	It may hold a connection to him.
15787020	15789020	Good luck.
15795020	15797020	New info was added to the spirit file.
15797020	15799020	Temporary retreat.
15799020	15801020	Let's save some pie.
15803020	15805020	They do be having death hanging over their heads.
15811020	15813020	I can't remember how, but...
15815020	15817020	No, wait. Hold on.
15817020	15819020	How do I exit this? Any...
15819020	15821020	Hack it.
15821020	15823020	Hack it. I think it was...
15823020	15825020	X? No.
15825020	15827020	Y?
15827020	15829020	Yeah, here it is.
15829020	15831020	We got it!
15835020	15837020	If we turn to Tito's screen,
15837020	15839020	all unsaved progress will be lost.
15839020	15841020	We saved already, so we're good.
15851020	15853020	Yay!
15859020	15861020	Yay!
15861020	15863020	How was that, Senpai?
15863020	15865020	Are you enjoying the game now?
15865020	15867020	Hold on. Let me move myself. There we go.
15867020	15869020	Did you enjoy the game now?
15869020	15871020	Did you enjoy the game now?
15871020	15873020	And my chat box is broken.
15873020	15875020	And my chat box is broken.
15875020	15877020	Man.
15877020	15879020	Really fun, right? I'm so glad.
15879020	15881020	I know that it's kind of slow
15881020	15883020	I know that it's kind of slow
15883020	15885020	to start.
15885020	15887020	Because I know when I started,
15887020	15889020	I ended up yapping a lot.
15889020	15891020	But it really ramps up, right?
15891020	15893020	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
15893020	15895020	So I'm glad that everyone's enjoying it.
15897020	15899020	So I hope...
15899020	15901020	Oh, and there's a sequel to this game, too.
15901020	15903020	So maybe we can
15903020	15905020	play the sequel
15905020	15907020	after we finish this one.
15907020	15909020	What do you think?
15909020	15911020	Oh my gosh, the Brooklyn Dacons!
15911020	15913020	Let's go!
15913020	15915020	The sequel, yeah, it's called...
15915020	15917020	Okay, so the series is called
15917020	15919020	Spirit Hunter.
15919020	15921020	This one is Deathmark.
15921020	15923020	The sequel is called No Good.
15923020	15925020	NG. Spirit Hunter...
15925020	15927020	Is it Spirit Hunter?
15927020	15929020	Shit.
15929020	15931020	Hold on.
15931020	15933020	Deathmark.
15933020	15935020	Spirit Hunter, yeah.
15935020	15937020	Spirit Hunter, the second game is called
15937020	15939020	Spirit Hunter NG.
15939020	15941020	No Good!
15941020	15943020	And there's going to be
15943020	15945020	another...
15945020	15947020	another one.
15947020	15949020	Another one following that.
15949020	15951020	That is releasing...
15951020	15953020	No.
15953020	15955020	It released already, right?
15955020	15957020	Spirit Hunter Deathmark 2.
15959020	15961020	Did it release already?
15961020	15963020	Tenpais, I don't remember.
15963020	15965020	I think it's already out, I think.
15965020	15967020	Okay, yeah.
15967020	15969020	There's another one that comes out.
15969020	15971020	Yeah.
15973020	15975020	Do you know when Deathmark came out?
15975020	15977020	Let me check.
15977020	15979020	It came out in both
15979020	15981020	English and Japanese
15981020	15983020	in April 2019.
15987020	15989020	It was apparent...
15989020	15991020	It was real 2019.
15991020	15993020	It was this one.
15993020	15995020	The second one came out in
15995020	15997020	2022, yeah.
15997020	15999020	And the latest one,
15999020	16001020	Deathmark...
16001020	16003020	Spirit Hunter Deathmark 2
16003020	16005020	came out
16005020	16007020	February 15, 2024.
16007020	16009020	Yeah.
16011020	16013020	So, uh...
16013020	16015020	Yeah,
16015020	16017020	they had to go into the
16017020	16019020	banger title.
16019020	16021020	So the game is practically
16021020	16023020	brand new, yeah.
16023020	16025020	I actually bought it
16025020	16027020	when it just came out.
16027020	16029020	I bought the original
16029020	16031020	limited edition
16031020	16033020	because I saw it in stores.
16033020	16035020	I saw it at GameStop
16035020	16037020	and I was like, yeah!
16037020	16039020	This looks cool! I love visual novels!
16039020	16041020	And so I bought it
16041020	16043020	for a PS4.
16043020	16045020	And then I got lazy...
16045020	16047020	I got lazy
16047020	16049020	and I wanted to stream it
16049020	16051020	but I didn't want to plug in my PS4!
16055020	16057020	I didn't want to...
16057020	16059020	So I bought it again on Steam!
16069020	16071020	I double-purchased it
16071020	16073020	because I was too lazy to plug it in!
16077020	16079020	But yeah, it's because I really wanted to...
16079020	16081020	What's the word? I really wanted
16081020	16083020	to...
16083020	16085020	play...
16085020	16087020	play it, but I was like, oh, I'm too lazy.
16087020	16089020	I'll probably stop being lazy
16089020	16091020	and...
16093020	16095020	actually plug in
16095020	16097020	my...
16097020	16099020	um...
16101020	16103020	my...
16105020	16107020	my systems?
16107020	16109020	My systems? Consoles?
16109020	16111020	Yeah, my consoles.
16113020	16115020	I bought it for PS4, yeah.
16115020	16117020	I don't... I don't have
16117020	16119020	the money
16119020	16121020	to pay for a PS5.
16123020	16125020	Actually, I was for a while
16125020	16127020	and I was like, why do I need a PS5?
16127020	16129020	And then now I'm just like, oh...
16129020	16131020	Well, it's kind of
16131020	16133020	backwards compatible, right?
16135020	16137020	Just say you're a super fan
16137020	16139020	and want to support the franchise even more.
16139020	16141020	Am I really a fan
16141020	16143020	if I never really played it to the end?
16147020	16149020	It's fine, the PS5 has no game.
16149020	16151020	Oh, but it's got like...
16151020	16153020	nice graphics.
16153020	16155020	Right?
16155020	16157020	It's got nice graphics.
16161020	16163020	And it's backwards and compatible,
16163020	16165020	so I thought that maybe
16165020	16167020	it would look prettier,
16167020	16169020	but I'm not sure
16169020	16171020	if it would look prettier at all...
16173020	16175020	at all for...
16177020	16179020	if it would make a difference,
16179020	16181020	you know, Senpai?
16184020	16187020	If I'm going to stream it through my PC,
16187020	16189020	I think it wouldn't
16189020	16191020	make that much of a difference, right?
16193020	16195020	At least, I don't think so.
16195020	16197020	Probably not, so that's why
16197020	16199020	in my mind I thought
16199020	16201020	um...
16201020	16203020	probably not, I probably...
16205020	16207020	I probably won't
16209020	16211020	won't get a PS5 yet.
16213020	16215020	It shouldn't be noticeable, yeah.
16215020	16217020	That's why I was like, okay, well,
16217020	16219020	if it's not going to improve the stream, I don't need it, right?
16223020	16225020	Everyone, PC is better.
16225020	16227020	Is your PC as strong as a PS5 though?
16233020	16235020	Yeah, PS5 isn't going anywhere
16235020	16237020	if you decide to want one later.
16237020	16239020	Yeah, I don't... they came out
16239020	16241020	of the slim, right?
16243020	16245020	Uh...
16245020	16247020	Came out the slim, which is slightly
16247020	16249020	cheaper, I think?
16257020	16259020	Um, right now, for my
16259020	16261020	PC, I'm using
16261020	16263020	uh...
16263020	16265020	an Xbox controller.
16265020	16267020	I have two Xbox controllers
16267020	16269020	and a PS4 controller,
16269020	16271020	a rose gold PS4 controller.
16274020	16276020	So, I don't know.
16282020	16284020	Um...
16284020	16286020	Yeah, I have the rose gold one.
16286020	16287020	I got it
16287020	16289020	when I was on sale.
16289020	16291020	Oh yeah,
16291020	16293020	Senpai, did you know that my first
16293020	16295020	home console was
16295020	16297020	a PS4?
16299020	16301020	My home... my first home console was a PS4.
16301020	16303020	Yeah, I think I told some Senpai's
16303020	16305020	earlier.
16305020	16307020	Yeah, like in a different stream.
16307020	16309020	I don't remember which stream, but I said...
16309020	16311020	My first console was a...
16311020	16313020	was a PS4.
16321020	16323020	Only handhelds before?
16323020	16325020	Yeah, my first handheld was
16325020	16327020	a DS... DS Lite, actually.
16327020	16329020	And then,
16329020	16331020	my second one
16331020	16333020	was...
16333020	16335020	a Vita?
16335020	16337020	Like a PS Vita?
16337020	16339020	And then...
16339020	16341020	And then I got a PSP,
16341020	16343020	finally.
16343020	16345020	Because it was on sale, because
16345020	16347020	PS Vita came out.
16347020	16349020	And then...
16351020	16353020	Honestly,
16353020	16355020	the Vita was so good, that thing never
16355020	16357020	died on me. That thing never died.
16357020	16359020	I left it for months, and it still had
16359020	16361020	70% batteries. Holy shit.
16365020	16367020	That was really good. That thing was good.
16367020	16369020	I have the...
16371020	16373020	the first gen of the PS Vita,
16373020	16375020	so it's super good.
16375020	16377020	It's got the beautiful screen.
16379020	16381020	They updated the screen to be
16381020	16383020	a lower quality, so it's had a lower price.
16383020	16385020	But like the first one? Yeah, the OLED.
16385020	16387020	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have that one.
16387020	16389020	That was my second one, because
16389020	16391020	it came out, and
16391020	16393020	I saw the color, it was white,
16393020	16395020	and I was like, oh, pretty!
16395020	16397020	That's why I got it!
16401020	16403020	So I got it, and I thought it was so nice.
16403020	16405020	It came with, um...
16405020	16407020	Assassin's Creed Liberation, I think.
16409020	16411020	It's also great
16411020	16413020	when you connect it to the PS4,
16413020	16415020	because it acts like another screen
16415020	16417020	and another controller. It's really great.
16417020	16419020	I don't know, I loved it. I loved it a lot.
16419020	16421020	I feel bad that it didn't take off.
16425020	16427020	She showed us a picture one day.
16427020	16429020	Yeah, I have, um...
16429020	16431020	I have some systems,
16431020	16433020	but now a friend of mine,
16433020	16435020	like one of my gal pals,
16435020	16437020	was decluttering.
16437020	16439020	And she was like,
16439020	16441020	hey,
16441020	16443020	you're streaming now, right?
16443020	16445020	And I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm streaming now.
16445020	16447020	I'm doing streaming stuff.
16447020	16449020	And she was like, I have
16449020	16451020	all these old consoles.
16451020	16453020	I don't need this anymore.
16453020	16455020	Do you want them? And so I inherited
16455020	16457020	her entire collection.
16457020	16459020	And I'm super thankful.
16463020	16465020	So I got
16465020	16467020	basically every console
16467020	16469020	basically
16469020	16471020	every console now.
16473020	16475020	Are you planning to get a 3DS
16475020	16477020	capture card for SMT4?
16477020	16479020	I don't know.
16479020	16481020	The guy who did like
16481020	16483020	DS capture stuff
16483020	16485020	doesn't make them anymore, right?
16487020	16489020	Sounds like a real homie.
16489020	16491020	I hope she gets good things in life. Yeah!
16491020	16493020	Is Mercy going to be a
16493020	16495020	retro slash nostalgia streamer then?
16495020	16497020	I'm hoping
16497020	16499020	I can play some games.
16499020	16501020	I ordered a retro tank.
16501020	16503020	Thank you, Senpai,
16503020	16505020	who crowdfunded that.
16505020	16507020	Thank you so much.
16507020	16509020	I ordered the retro tank already,
16509020	16511020	so it should arrive.
16511020	16513020	It's still kind of like processing,
16513020	16515020	but when it arrives,
16515020	16517020	I really want
16517020	16519020	to play.
16519020	16521020	I really want to play
16521020	16523020	on the Wii.
16525020	16527020	On the Wii.
16527020	16529020	No more heroes,
16529020	16531020	so I can use
16531020	16533020	the Wii remote.
16537020	16539020	It has the speaker.
16539020	16541020	I heard you can use it as
16541020	16543020	like a phone.
16543020	16545020	And you can hear the voices
16545020	16547020	go through the Wii
16547020	16549020	remote speaker. And I think that's real cool.
16549020	16551020	I think that's really cool.
16553020	16555020	So, that's something
16555020	16557020	I want to play. I also have
16557020	16559020	a bunch of PS2 games that
16559020	16561020	I want to play as well.
16561020	16563020	And I think it would be just really
16563020	16565020	fun.
16565020	16567020	And so
16567020	16569020	I thought this...
16569020	16571020	I googled it to see how I can capture
16575020	16577020	capture the
16577020	16579020	the consoles without
16579020	16581020	like too much equipment.
16581020	16583020	And so I found the retro tank
16583020	16585020	and then I was like, oh, it's
16585020	16587020	kind of expensive.
16587020	16589020	Maybe I'll put it on my list and maybe
16589020	16591020	we can crowdfund it together so
16591020	16593020	I can give more stuff
16593020	16595020	to show more stuff
16595020	16597020	to
16597020	16599020	to senpais. And I would be able to play
16599020	16601020	things on original hardware.
16601020	16603020	So I would love that.
16603020	16605020	I would love to do that.
16607020	16609020	So, yeah.
16609020	16611020	The Wii is retro?
16611020	16613020	How old is the Wii? It should be retro, right?
16625020	16627020	The Wii came out in 2006,
16627020	16629020	Senpai.
16637020	16639020	That's like...
16643020	16645020	I forget what year it is.
16645020	16647020	What year is it? 2024.
16655020	16657020	I can't math.
16657020	16659020	It's 18 years old.
16659020	16661020	It's legal.
16661020	16663020	It's an adult now.
16663020	16665020	Okay, Senpai.
16671020	16673020	Why did you bait yourself
16673020	16675020	into doing math, Mercy? It's because
16675020	16677020	I want to prove that it's...
16677020	16679020	I hate math,
16679020	16681020	but I want to prove that it's
16681020	16683020	uh...
16685020	16687020	It's uh...
16687020	16689020	It's old.
16693020	16695020	So...
16705020	16707020	Wii is officially legal. Like as an adult
16707020	16709020	it's officially like a legal adult, right?
16711020	16713020	Um...
16713020	16715020	Yeah, so I would love to play like
16715020	16717020	PS2 games.
16717020	16719020	And...
16719020	16721020	I also have like an Xbox.
16721020	16723020	I think it's the 360?
16723020	16725020	Anyways, I have like so many,
16725020	16727020	so many like consoles now.
16727020	16729020	I have like SNES.
16731020	16733020	I don't think I have a Genesis though.
16733020	16735020	I have to check.
16735020	16737020	Wait, or maybe I do.
16737020	16739020	Oh well, I have like so many.
16739020	16741020	I have so many like consoles now
16741020	16743020	and I would love to play.
16743020	16745020	Just this collection after all.
16745020	16747020	It's um...
16751020	16753020	It's uh...
16753020	16755020	Like my friend gave it to me, right?
16755020	16757020	Like she gave it to me.
16757020	16759020	That's so nice!
16763020	16765020	So that's why I'm just like
16765020	16767020	well...
16767020	16769020	It was so kind.
16769020	16771020	She was so kind enough
16771020	16773020	to give it to me, so I should probably
16773020	16775020	you know...
16775020	16777020	I should probably
16777020	16779020	play it, right?
16781020	16783020	Like I have so many games now.
16783020	16785020	Like so many!
16789020	16791020	SNES threatening in some way.
16791020	16793020	What do you mean?
16793020	16795020	Damn, is your friend single?
16801020	16803020	I'm pie.
16803020	16805020	I'm pie. Please only look at me.
16811020	16813020	Please only look at me, Senpai.
16815020	16817020	Please only look at me, Senpai.
16821020	16823020	I would greatly appreciate you
16823020	16825020	not...
16825020	16827020	not moving your eyes
16827020	16829020	to someone else.
16829020	16831020	Okay?
16835020	16837020	I think you need
16837020	16839020	some time alone in a barrel.
16839020	16841020	Six feet under.
16859020	16861020	Oh, they get a breathing tube at least?
16861020	16863020	No.
16869020	16871020	I'm about to play
16871020	16873020	all these nice games
16873020	16875020	for Senpais.
16875020	16877020	And this is how you treat me?
16877020	16879020	Damn!
16883020	16885020	Anyways...
16885020	16887020	Senpais, ignoring that Senpai.
16891020	16893020	Um...
16893020	16895020	I think it'll be great
16895020	16897020	to play like all these games.
16897020	16899020	I want to go through
16899020	16901020	my collection of games
16901020	16903020	before I
16903020	16905020	go through
16905020	16907020	any...
16907020	16909020	any other...
16909020	16911020	any other newer games.
16911020	16913020	Unless...
16913020	16915020	you know, SMT
16915020	16917020	5
16917020	16919020	Vengeance
16919020	16921020	looking pretty nice right now.
16921020	16923020	But I don't want to play it.
16923020	16925020	I have to play the
16925020	16927020	first one,
16927020	16929020	the SMT 5,
16929020	16931020	which gives me motion sickness, so I have to take my pills
16931020	16933020	or something.
16935020	16937020	Vengeance is out. I know!
16937020	16939020	I see all these, like,
16939020	16941020	screenshots and I'm like,
16941020	16943020	it's looking kind of...
16943020	16945020	It's looking really great. It looks really great.
16955020	16957020	Vengeance is basically 5,
16957020	16959020	but better. I mean...
16959020	16961020	Uh, yeah, it's...
16963020	16965020	Does Minecraft activate your motion sickness?
16965020	16967020	Yeah, it does.
16967020	16969020	Like, anything kind of first person
16969020	16971020	often
16971020	16973020	activates the
16973020	16975020	the motion sickness. And you know what?
16975020	16977020	What is also?
16977020	16979020	Um...
16979020	16981020	It's not a sequel to 5,
16981020	16983020	just an updated version? Seriously?
16985020	16987020	I thought it was a sequel
16987020	16989020	because it's...
16989020	16991020	because it's Apocalypse, right? So...
16991020	16993020	SMT 4
16993020	16995020	Apocalypse was a completely different cast.
17001020	17003020	It's like a completely different cast.
17003020	17005020	Like, you play as a completely different character
17005020	17007020	and everything.
17007020	17009020	It's like Persona 5 Royale
17009020	17011020	is an updated
17011020	17013020	P5. Seriously?
17015020	17017020	Um...
17017020	17019020	But I thought it said
17019020	17021020	Apocalypse with it!
17021020	17023020	But the subtitle
17023020	17025020	was also like Apocalypse
17025020	17027020	and I thought all of the sequels
17027020	17029020	were like Apocalypse.
17029020	17031020	Vengeance is just an update?
17031020	17033020	Huh...
17039020	17041020	Because like,
17041020	17043020	SMT 5 made me, like, throw up.
17046020	17048020	Made me throw up.
17048020	17050020	And another game that
17050020	17052020	surprisingly also makes me throw up is Sonic.
17052020	17054020	And all Sonic games also
17054020	17056020	has like...
17061020	17063020	has like, lots of motion
17063020	17065020	and like, screen shakes
17065020	17067020	that I was like...
17069020	17071020	So there's a lot of games that makes me go
17071020	17073020	ugh...
17074020	17076020	So can you do FPS?
17076020	17077020	Uh...
17077020	17079020	First person shooter?
17079020	17081020	First person?
17085020	17087020	So yeah, that's probably...
17087020	17089020	something that makes me going
17089020	17091020	ugh...
17091020	17093020	ugh...
17093020	17095020	Mercy throwing upstream?
17095020	17097020	Well, at least throwing up is allowed on YouTube.
17097020	17099020	On...
17099020	17101020	on Twitch, you would be banned for that.
17102020	17104020	They banned it!
17106020	17108020	Against TOS?
17110020	17112020	Yeah, only third person games, realistically.
17112020	17114020	Um, Strani did say
17114020	17117020	I should expand my gaming repertoire.
17117020	17119020	So...
17119020	17121020	I'm willing to try
17121020	17123020	basically all games.
17131020	17133020	Twitch bans you for getting sick?
17133020	17135020	Um, and you...
17135020	17137020	It's because...
17138020	17140020	I believe it's because...
17140020	17142020	Okay, okay.
17142020	17144020	This is like a story that I think I heard.
17144020	17146020	This is the reason why, but I could be wrong.
17147020	17149020	But I remember it's because
17149020	17151020	someone was
17151020	17153020	doing some kind of fetish thing
17153020	17155020	where they were throwing up.
17155020	17157020	And it was like, pretty dangerous.
17157020	17159020	And it was encouraging, like, you know...
17159020	17161020	Um...
17161020	17163020	Like, it was like...
17163020	17165020	doing some fetish thing
17165020	17167020	where people were paying them
17167020	17169020	to throw up.
17169020	17171020	So...
17171020	17173020	to take action against that,
17173020	17175020	um...
17175020	17177020	Twitch was like, okay, you cannot throw
17177020	17179020	up on stream then.
17181020	17183020	Ahem.
17190020	17192020	Hey, Mercy, if you were chill
17192020	17194020	with all visual novels out,
17194020	17196020	it would be fine too. Um...
17196020	17198020	Mostly it was like the point-and-click stuff.
17198020	17200020	She was like, I need you to...
17200020	17202020	I need you to try more games.
17202020	17204020	And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I can do that.
17204020	17206020	I can do that.
17207020	17209020	Is this like the girl
17209020	17211020	bottling her farts and getting sick?
17211020	17213020	Probably.
17213020	17215020	I don't know.
17215020	17217020	Would you play
17217020	17219020	other games like SMT Devil Survivor
17219020	17221020	or Fire Emblem?
17221020	17223020	I don't like Devil Survivor.
17223020	17225020	I played it on the DS. I have it for the DS.
17225020	17227020	I don't like Devil Survivor.
17227020	17229020	I just don't like the gameplay mechanic
17229020	17231020	of it.
17231020	17233020	I did like, uh, what's the one again
17233020	17235020	where they have all the massive stuff?
17235020	17237020	I don't know, what was the call again?
17239020	17241020	Uh...
17247020	17249020	Strange Journey.
17249020	17251020	Yes, I like Strange Journey though.
17251020	17253020	I like Strange Journey.
17255020	17257020	And I did like what I played
17257020	17259020	for the PS2
17259020	17261020	of what I played.
17261020	17263020	Did you know Devil Saga
17263020	17265020	was good too?
17269020	17271020	Uh...
17271020	17273020	Strange Journey or Archie and Noah
17273020	17275020	are redux. I liked
17275020	17277020	both, but I own redux
17277020	17279020	and I had to borrow from a friend
17279020	17281020	the original Strange Journey.
17283020	17285020	Um...
17285020	17287020	I didn't like the
17287020	17289020	the gameplay mechanics of
17291020	17293020	of, uh...
17293020	17295020	uh...
17295020	17297020	Devil Survivor though. I didn't like that one.
17299020	17301020	I just, I know, I know it's like
17301020	17303020	people were like, oh well, whatever.
17303020	17305020	I just didn't like the like tiles.
17305020	17307020	I didn't like it.
17311020	17313020	So, that's why I was kind of like
17313020	17315020	ehh, no, no thanks.
17317020	17319020	Uh, it felt like
17319020	17321020	a tactics game and like a,
17321020	17323020	you know, like one of those chess tactic games
17323020	17325020	or like...
17325020	17327020	Uh, like, I'm gonna get,
17327020	17329020	I'm gonna get fricking fried for this,
17329020	17331020	but I'm not a huge fan of Fire Emblem
17331020	17333020	because of like, its chess
17333020	17335020	like, tile mechanics.
17337020	17339020	Because I was like, uh...
17339020	17341020	I don't know.
17341020	17343020	Kind of boring.
17345020	17347020	It was kind of boring.
17347020	17349020	I mean, maybe I'll give it another go,
17349020	17351020	but when I played it,
17351020	17353020	I didn't like it.
17357020	17359020	Like, uh...
17359020	17361020	I also, I remember trying to stream
17363020	17365020	um...
17367020	17369020	Fire Emblem, which one is it? Three Houses?
17369020	17371020	And I just could not
17371020	17373020	make it entertaining.
17373020	17375020	I just could not make it entertaining.
17375020	17377020	I mean, I tried.
17377020	17379020	Really hard.
17381020	17383020	So, yeah.
17385020	17387020	I just didn't like the tiles.
17387020	17389020	I was like, uh...
17389020	17391020	Maybe...
17391020	17393020	Maybe I can try it again later,
17393020	17395020	but...
17395020	17397020	I don't think
17397020	17399020	I like that type of gameplay.
17403020	17405020	But yeah, I do like SMT though,
17405020	17407020	like SMT games as a whole.
17409020	17411020	I do have... Oh, I do have...
17411020	17413020	I did like, um...
17413020	17415020	I did like...
17417020	17419020	Devil Summoner.
17419020	17421020	That one was good.
17423020	17425020	I like that one.
17427020	17429020	You take Strange Journey.
17429020	17431020	Do you... Do you like Soul Hackers?
17435020	17437020	Hold on, give me a minute.
17437020	17439020	I never played Soul Hackers, actually.
17439020	17441020	That's the only one I didn't...
17443020	17445020	That's the only one I didn't play.
17445020	17447020	I didn't get to play Soul Hackers.
17447020	17449020	That was the only one I didn't...
17449020	17451020	I didn't play.
17451020	17453020	I was never able to find it.
17461020	17463020	I know the second one,
17463020	17465020	the Hackers 2 that came out recently,
17465020	17467020	has very mixed reviews,
17467020	17469020	and it makes me
17469020	17471020	hesitant to even pick it up,
17471020	17473020	you know?
17475020	17477020	I think another game I would love to play
17477020	17479020	are the Atelier games.
17479020	17481020	So, I'd love to play, like...
17481020	17483020	Atelier.
17483020	17485020	I know... I know...
17485020	17487020	My first Atelier game is not exactly like
17487020	17489020	one that...
17489020	17491020	Uh...
17491020	17493020	That people are like,
17493020	17495020	oh, that's not... That's the one that...
17495020	17497020	That you... You like?
17497020	17499020	So, the one that I liked
17499020	17501020	and the one that I played,
17501020	17503020	the most of that I really enjoyed
17503020	17505020	was Liddy and Soule.
17505020	17507020	I don't know, I thought it was cute?
17511020	17513020	I thought it was super cute,
17513020	17515020	and I thought it was, like, great.
17515020	17517020	And then I wanted to play,
17517020	17519020	like, Sophie and stuff,
17519020	17521020	but I just never had the time to,
17521020	17523020	and then I played a bit of Ryza,
17523020	17525020	and I was like, oh, yeah, this is great.
17525020	17527020	I played, um...
17527020	17529020	But then I just didn't have time to pick it up again.
17529020	17531020	I bought the Ryza books, though,
17531020	17533020	and I loved the art by Noko.
17533020	17535020	Noko did a great job
17535020	17537020	on all the arts, because I think
17537020	17539020	they're a great artist.
17539020	17541020	Um...
17541020	17543020	I played...
17543020	17545020	Atelier...
17545020	17547020	Rorona, I think?
17547020	17549020	Rorona?
17549020	17551020	Not Rorona, sorry.
17551020	17553020	Which one is the one with the pink-haired
17553020	17555020	daughter... daughter one?
17557020	17559020	What's the list of it?
17559020	17561020	Not Meridu.
17561020	17563020	It's, like, the one
17563020	17565020	that's, like, one of them's a kid.
17565020	17567020	Uh...
17567020	17569020	Shit, what's it called?
17569020	17571020	The kid?
17571020	17573020	I think? Is it Meridu?
17577020	17579020	It's kind of new-ish.
17579020	17581020	No, it's not Meridu.
17581020	17583020	Hold on.
17583020	17585020	List of...
17585020	17587020	Atelier games?
17587020	17589020	Atelier games? Thank you.
17589020	17591020	Uh...
17591020	17593020	This one!
17593020	17595020	Atelier Lulua!
17595020	17597020	I hated Lulua!
17597020	17599020	I hated Lulua!
17599020	17601020	It was cheap! I was like...
17601020	17603020	I feel like I'm playing a stupid phone game!
17603020	17605020	What the fuck?
17609020	17611020	I know what her keyboard sounds
17611020	17613020	is so immaculate.
17613020	17615020	Oh yeah, my keyboard, it's, um...
17615020	17617020	red switches
17617020	17619020	so they don't make that much noise.
17619020	17621020	Sorry, Senpai.
17621020	17623020	But, like,
17623020	17625020	Atelier Lulua was shit garbage.
17625020	17627020	I was like, I feel like I'm playing a stupid phone game.
17629020	17631020	It was, it wasn't interactive.
17631020	17633020	It was no fun.
17633020	17635020	I feel like it was rushed.
17635020	17637020	It was not good.
17637020	17639020	It was not good.
17641020	17643020	Like, it looks cute. Like, it looks cute
17643020	17645020	as fuck, right?
17645020	17647020	Like...
17647020	17649020	The design is, uh...
17651020	17653020	is, it's cute.
17653020	17655020	I thought it would be, like,
17655020	17657020	Liddy and Sue
17657020	17659020	and it just wasn't there.
17661020	17663020	It just wasn't there.
17663020	17665020	And I was playing Lulua and I was like,
17665020	17667020	oh fuck, this sucks.
17667020	17669020	This really fucking sucks.
17669020	17671020	Uh...
17671020	17673020	And so I just
17673020	17675020	didn't want to play
17675020	17677020	Lulua.
17677020	17679020	After, like, the getting out of the town,
17679020	17681020	I was like, and playing a little bit
17681020	17683020	in the area, I was like, this fucking sucks.
17687020	17689020	So, I didn't enjoy it,
17689020	17691020	but I hear Riza is so much better
17691020	17693020	and I played a bit of Riza and I think
17693020	17695020	I think I enjoyed it.
17695020	17697020	I really think I did enjoy
17697020	17699020	Riza.
17699020	17701020	Uh, but, like, Lulua sucked.
17701020	17703020	Uh, Riza.
17703020	17705020	And I would love to play, like, Riza 2
17705020	17707020	and Riza 3. I have Riza on
17707020	17709020	PS4, so I'll have to plug that in
17709020	17711020	again. I, I, I'm kind of like,
17711020	17713020	I don't, I kind of don't
17713020	17715020	want to, uh, buy
17715020	17717020	more games.
17719020	17721020	So, yeah, but otherwise,
17721020	17723020	yeah, those are some games that I'm
17723020	17725020	kind of like, yeah, I kind of want to play those,
17725020	17727020	but I'm also
17727020	17729020	a little hesitant because it's
17729020	17731020	grindy and
17731020	17733020	I don't know, sometimes we'll be bored if
17733020	17735020	I grind it a lot.
17737020	17739020	Any JRPGs you want to play on stream,
17739020	17741020	like Dragon Quest? Uh...
17747020	17749020	What was the, what was the western RPG
17749020	17751020	that I was playing that I was
17751020	17753020	saying before? Wild Arms!
17753020	17755020	I play Wild Arms.
17757020	17759020	And...
17759020	17761020	Uh...
17763020	17765020	And...
17765020	17767020	I don't know, other ones.
17767020	17769020	I have to look through my collection again.
17777020	17779020	Um...
17779020	17781020	Neptunia?
17781020	17783020	Oh gosh, Neptunia games suck.
17783020	17785020	It's hot
17785020	17787020	garbage.
17791020	17793020	I look, I look at...
17793020	17795020	I go
17795020	17797020	to the
17797020	17799020	store.
17799020	17801020	The, the, the, the
17801020	17803020	the worker was
17803020	17805020	like...
17805020	17807020	was like, oh, Neptunia?
17807020	17809020	Are, are these game, I was
17809020	17811020	meaning to get into it. Are these games good?
17811020	17813020	I go, no, it fucking sucks. Don't even bother.
17813020	17815020	Pay them, pay them
17815020	17817020	their money and go
17817020	17819020	leave with my Neptunia game.
17819020	17821020	And they fucky. And I'm just like, I fucking
17821020	17823020	hate this game, but it's so cute.
17823020	17825020	Dimes are so cute.
17829020	17831020	Like, honestly, hot garbage
17831020	17833020	shit gameplay, really great
17833020	17835020	design, really great characters.
17835020	17837020	I'm just like...
17841020	17843020	It's garbage.
17843020	17845020	Absolutely garbage. Every time,
17845020	17847020	every time I, I play another
17847020	17849020	Neptunia game, I'm just like, please
17849020	17851020	let it be good. And it's not.
17861020	17863020	I fucking hate it.
17863020	17865020	Fucking hate it.
17871020	17873020	I literally was like
17873020	17875020	literally the cash register guy
17875020	17877020	was like, oh yeah, I've been meaning to get into
17877020	17879020	the series. Is it any good? No.
17883020	17885020	Leaves.
17889020	17891020	But yeah, um,
17891020	17893020	I think I'll play Neptunia. I think all I
17893020	17895020	would do would be like, I hate
17895020	17897020	this.
17897020	17899020	All I would say
17899020	17901020	is that I would hate this.
17901020	17903020	Would you ever play the world end with you
17903020	17905020	on your DS Lite?
17905020	17907020	Uh, I would, but
17907020	17909020	I don't have anything to capture
17909020	17911020	DS with. So you'd need
17911020	17913020	like, uh, completely new DS
17913020	17915020	with a capture system
17915020	17917020	on it. And I just don't have that. And the guy
17917020	17919020	who used to make them, don't make them anymore.
17919020	17921020	So, uh, yeah, we're shit
17921020	17923020	out of luck, guys.
17925020	17927020	And I am not allowed to do anything else
17927020	17929020	other than play on original hardware stuff.
17935020	17937020	Any PS2 games
17937020	17939020	that you're looking forward to streaming soon?
17939020	17941020	Definitely.
17943020	17945020	Probably digital
17945020	17947020	Devil Saga
17947020	17949020	and Devil Summoner. Yeah, those two
17949020	17951020	are definitely like my main ones that I'm just like, yeah,
17951020	17953020	I'll be great.
17955020	17957020	Ah, DS Lite
17957020	17959020	Hand Cam Stream. That's not going to
17959020	17961020	work out senpai because I
17961020	17963020	I can get like button
17963020	17965020	mashing and it would just shake all the time.
17965020	17967020	So you wouldn't even be able to see
17967020	17969020	what is going on, right? And then I
17969020	17971020	turn
17971020	17973020	the DS and go
17973020	17975020	and it's not going to capture, right?
17977020	17979020	You know what I mean? Like handheld.
17979020	17981020	It's like you're you're supposed to turn
17981020	17983020	and go
17983020	17985020	go
17991020	17993020	You wouldn't happen to know Legend of
17993020	17995020	Legia, would you, Mercy?
17995020	17997020	Legend of Legia?
17997020	17999020	Legend of
17999020	18001020	Legia.
18001020	18003020	I might have to see it.
18003020	18005020	I do not know this game.
18007020	18009020	Well, it looks pretty cool.
18009020	18011020	I don't even know if I have it though.
18011020	18013020	I might have it. I have to look.
18021020	18023020	I have to look at it, but
18023020	18025020	I definitely want to play with like
18025020	18027020	if I could somehow
18031020	18033020	Excuse me.
18037020	18039020	Too much. Not enough liquid.
18043020	18045020	If I could
18049020	18051020	If I could
18053020	18055020	capture it somehow
18055020	18057020	for senpai while still be able
18057020	18059020	to use the stylus and everything because
18059020	18061020	let me tell you
18061020	18063020	it was really hard to play games.
18063020	18065020	DS games without
18065020	18067020	using the stylus.
18073020	18075020	You know, Legend of Legia, my nuts
18075020	18077020	asshole
18095020	18097020	Anyways
18103020	18105020	But yeah, I love using
18105020	18107020	the stylus. I'm not going to lie.
18107020	18109020	I love using the stylus so
18109020	18111020	playing any DS games without
18111020	18113020	using the stylus would fucking suck.
18113020	18115020	Forget, do you like rhythm games?
18115020	18117020	No.
18117020	18119020	I suck at rhythm. I have no sense of rhythm.
18119020	18121020	Thank you, Jamie, for the
18121020	18123020	for the
18123020	18125020	most tier, for sending off the most
18125020	18127020	tier. Thank you.
18127020	18129020	For being a member.
18129020	18131020	Most tier and membership is still the same, right?
18131020	18133020	Yeah, yeah.
18133020	18135020	It should be the same. Thank you for being a member.
18143020	18145020	I wonder if you do the Yakuza series. I do have some
18145020	18147020	Yakuza games, so
18147020	18149020	Maybe
18149020	18151020	I had fun, but most of the time
18151020	18153020	I know
18153020	18155020	I know that
18155020	18157020	I'm going to just
18157020	18159020	play the claw game over
18159020	18161020	and over.
18167020	18169020	I'll play the claw game over and over.
18169020	18171020	I'll be like, check this out, Senpai.
18171020	18173020	Yeah.
18177020	18179020	Look at me. I'm
18179020	18181020	winning.
18185020	18187020	Yeah, winning prizes for Senpai.
18191020	18193020	Go to karaoke.
18193020	18195020	I suck at karaoke, by the way.
18199020	18201020	I suck at the karaoke because it's like
18201020	18203020	I'm not familiar
18203020	18205020	because I always get confused about which
18205020	18207020	controller I'm using. So when it's like
18207020	18209020	press the buttons and the rhythm
18209020	18211020	and I'm like, oh shit, which buttons which
18215020	18217020	Honestly, I went to
18217020	18219020	the
18219020	18221020	when I was playing Yakuza Zero, I went to the
18223020	18225020	the video club a lot.
18233020	18235020	The video store a lot.
18237020	18239020	I
18245020	18247020	Me too for completion rewards, right?
18247020	18249020	Yeah, completion rewards.
18263020	18265020	Get that a hundred percent.
18267020	18269020	Oh
18269020	18271020	man, I'm still yapping.
18271020	18273020	I'm still yapping.
18285020	18287020	I want to play lots of games with Senpai
18287020	18289020	and I know it's like
18289020	18291020	oh
18291020	18293020	I feel bad though
18293020	18295020	because
18295020	18297020	all I've been playing have been games
18297020	18299020	and I've been like
18299020	18301020	oh yeah, I want to schedule this game
18301020	18303020	and this game and then I'm like
18303020	18305020	I should probably schedule in some other
18305020	18307020	stuff too.
18309020	18311020	Are you planning to do another karaoke stream?
18311020	18313020	Yeah.
18313020	18315020	I don't know when
18315020	18317020	but yeah.
18321020	18323020	I've been like, oh my gosh, I want to play this game
18323020	18325020	this game and this game and this game
18325020	18327020	other stuff, yeah, like ASMR
18327020	18329020	maybe like
18329020	18331020	I don't know like
18331020	18333020	hand cam streams
18333020	18335020	uh
18335020	18337020	batsu wheel or something like that
18337020	18339020	but me I was like a game, game, game, game
18339020	18341020	game, game, game, game, game, game, game
18347020	18349020	like I was like maybe I should do
18349020	18351020	do those things
18351020	18353020	and I'm just like
18353020	18355020	but this game, I want to play this game
18355020	18357020	with Senpai
18357020	18359020	Senpai, help me, this part is hard
18365020	18367020	speaking of hand cam streams
18367020	18369020	how did the alchemy come out?
18369020	18371020	It's super cute!
18371020	18373020	It's unlike my makeup
18373020	18375020	it's not like my makeup
18375020	18377020	uh
18377020	18379020	container thing
18379020	18381020	oh well
18381020	18383020	it's on that right now
18389020	18391020	so that's why I was like
18391020	18393020	uh okay
18395020	18397020	honestly I'm just like uh
18397020	18399020	hand cam ASMR
18399020	18401020	um I'm not sure if I can
18401020	18403020	knew that I feel like
18405020	18407020	I feel like it's you know
18409020	18411020	it's just super awkward
18413020	18415020	since I'm very unfamiliar
18415020	18417020	with ASMR
18417020	18419020	and I'm still learning
18419020	18421020	I would be like just me
18421020	18423020	just need my hands just go like
18423020	18425020	ugh
18425020	18427020	shrugging every moment
18431020	18433020	like I don't know what I'm doing
18435020	18437020	I'm just doing what I think
18437020	18439020	would sound nice
18439020	18441020	honestly like
18441020	18443020	I bought some things and I was like
18443020	18445020	um
18445020	18447020	I think this would sound nice on a microphone
18447020	18449020	on like the 3D
18449020	18451020	oh I think it would sound nice
18451020	18453020	gives us, gives you a thumbs up
18453020	18455020	yeah
18463020	18465020	so I feel so awkward
18465020	18467020	when I do like ASMR
18467020	18469020	I mean like
18469020	18471020	I think
18471020	18473020	I kind of face palm on myself
18473020	18475020	when people are like do ear copying
18475020	18477020	and then I was like
18479020	18481020	the 3D all ears with your hands
18481020	18483020	and I said okay
18483020	18485020	and then I had to ask
18485020	18487020	10 pies, now what
18487020	18489020	ah
18493020	18495020	I didn't know what copying was
18501020	18503020	like I was researching
18503020	18505020	stuff and then I was like
18505020	18507020	I don't know everything
18509020	18511020	so yeah I feel a little
18511020	18513020	embarrassed about that
18513020	18523540	But yeah, otherwise it's um, yeah, I think it's fun, it's also fun.
18523540	18529580	The giggles were the best part, I think Senpai is making me laugh and then it's really hard
18529580	18536820	to not laugh when you're trying to not laugh and then it becomes like it's you laugh harder.
18536820	18545020	Oh yeah, just try, try trying to laugh quietly or trying to not laugh and then you end up
18545020	18553300	laughing, you know, and then you keep on laughing and you can't stop.
18553300	18562220	So yeah, that is the giggle, yeah, the giggle feedback loop, exactly.
18562220	18570580	So yeah, oh speaking of Senpai, um, did you see my new ASMR video?
18570580	18579100	Kind of, it's kind of like a jokie ASMR video.
18579100	18580100	You did?
18580100	18581100	You did?
18581100	18582100	Yeah.
18582100	18583100	Did you know?
18583100	18584100	My laughing?
18584100	18587380	I didn't stop laughing, it was straight up.
18587380	18600340	I laughed for, I couldn't get past, I laughed, I laughed non-stop, that was one take, yeah.
18600340	18604340	You know what else is also one take?
18604340	18608900	That's surprising?
18608900	18620260	My cover song, the like, notice me Senpai cover song was also one take.
18620260	18621980	Because I will tell you why.
18621980	18627460	People were like, oh, why didn't you do it in parts and I was like, listen, that song
18627460	18634420	is kind of bad, I'm not going to lie to you, um, that song is kind of bad, so if I don't
18634420	18645300	do it in one take, I'm going to lose the rhythm really fast.
18645300	18657660	So I, like, when I tried it in parts, I was like, I cannot, I cannot do this in more than
18657660	18687660	one part because it's going to lose, I'm going to just be like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-
18687660	18710660	different like that's that's the that's the beat right it's hard it's hard to follow that
18710660	18713500	it's hard to follow that so I was like I have to do it in one shot
18713500	18726540	hey yo why are you clapping to the beat of the song and pie I saw you at school today took
18726540	18734260	your picture then I walked no then I snapped away I want you to notice me but I'm just someone
18734260	18742660	you don't notice still I think I've got another rival I have to kill right you see you see where
18742700	18751340	I'm just like okay this is not this is having I'm having problems here please notice me some pie
18751340	18768700	please notice me some pie right and then I messed up a bunch of times honestly but but
18768700	18784500	editors be editing you know luckily like it it's it's hard if when I did the song it was
18784500	18796020	some pie I saw you at school today took your picture then I snuck away I want you to notice me
18796020	18803060	but you're just someone I'm just someone you don't notice fuck it's really hard it's really hard
18803060	18810620	okay so it's it's a song it's definitely a song you cannot sing in parts you should share the
18810620	18819420	unedited version someday the unedited version only has one mistake it only has one mistake and
18819420	18825300	the mistake is an please notice me one please notice me some pie that was easily edited and
18825300	18833260	the only reason why that was a mistake was because I ran out of breath one please notice me some
18833260	18851020	pie and it was just like please notice me some pie and that was it breathing breathing
18851020	18861940	specs again that cup sounded real about Calif was real I was easily edited out because well I
18861940	18868900	say like please notice me some pie like a million times right like so many times just replace one
18868900	18886140	it's fine like that was the only mistake I had and I think I lost the beat a little bit towards
18886140	18901460	the end cuz I was like okay I hate this song like I originally I actually asked cuz I was like
18901460	18909340	I'm supposed to cover this and I know I know it's like a song that people like but I honestly do
18909340	18918180	not like the song personally because it just doesn't sound good to me then again I am also not a
18918180	18924540	music person and as you all know that I am I don't really listen to music senpai senpai so I don't
18924540	18932860	listen to music so I'm kind of insane I'm kind of insane it's probably yeah it's probably just
18932860	18942980	something simple like it's not enough melody or something it turned out well man yeah I'm glad it
18942980	18950380	turned out well because I was like oh no music at all yeah like when I'm studying or focused I
18950380	18960780	don't listen to music like at all the only times I ever listen to music is kind of like if I want
18960780	18974220	something atmospheric then it's like a gay molestee or anime song really no song when though I would
18974220	18985580	love to I would love to release some of my original songs yeah you listen to Amiens or
18985580	18991540	white noise or not listen to things why you work I don't listen to anything at all why I work senpai
18991540	19000300	like honestly I do not listen to any music it is silent why I'm working I cannot have anything
19000540	19013420	interrupt me why I think like otherwise I get too distracted or it's just I don't like it
19017740	19023820	like I just don't like it I just need my moment to to be in my head and just write it
19023980	19033580	but like most people will just call me insane and they're right I am definitely not someone
19034460	19040380	um that's not normal I know that's not normal so that's why people are like yeah you're kind of
19040380	19049100	insane and I'm like yeah you're right you're right that is insane behavior but I don't know it's just
19049100	19057660	something I've been like doing most of my life like if I need total silence okay this is
19057660	19069660	this is going to be very funny but when I was in college I would sometimes if I wanted total
19069660	19081580	deafening silence I would work in the bathroom I would study in the bathroom because it was quiet
19081580	19088300	there was nothing yeah it was just like you know the echoing or like whatever like the
19088300	19092380	complete silence in the bathroom was just I just studied there
19097180	19105260	but the germs it's my germs like at home at home not like in the school bathroom I meant at
19105260	19113420	home I would study in the bathroom like in the tub because I could just focus there
19123740	19132460	okay if you top has plenty of space and like I would actually bring in a table I would bring
19132460	19144700	in a table and then I would just work in silence because it was like away from everything there
19144700	19153580	was nothing distracting me I would just I just work and it it was really productive
19154540	19162620	it was a tub full full of what it's just me it's just me I'll just sit in there or I'll sit on
19163580	19170140	I'll put down the toilet seat like cover and then I would just put the table and just start studying
19174060	19179260	not soaking in the water no it's like empty empty you know whatever gets you to pass
19180220	19185580	I got pretty good grade senpai so don't worry don't worry senpai I got good grades
19197580	19204860	so yeah I would just work in the bathroom and just study and write notes in the bathroom
19204860	19209980	because there was nothing distracting me and the bathroom has like white walls so it felt
19209980	19214540	kind of sterile too so I was like okay yeah it's just peaceful here I can study here
19217100	19223500	because if I'm in my if I'm in my bedroom and I'm just like oh I have so many toys to play with
19224060	19238140	how do I get this kind of power like studying power I don't know
19241100	19250300	toys yeah like you know my ds is there or the tv is there and and uh look my vita oh my gosh look
19250300	19251740	there's new shows ah
19255820	19265900	oh my gosh books mangos mangos yeah I can't think when it's too quiet how'd you get the opposite
19272780	19278860	honestly using a tv as a toy is crazy really I don't know I feel like technology is like a
19278940	19289980	sort of toy for everyone right that's why I call it a toy um
19295900	19299180	honestly how I got to study was I guess
19304060	19305980	I didn't have anything else to think about
19309420	19314220	I I didn't have anything else to think about and deadlines really worried me and I had like
19314220	19319740	the crippling anxiety of failure so I was like no I can't do it I had I have to pass
19324780	19326940	and I don't know I also had uh
19329260	19333740	I had like a genuine interest in the subject as well
19334060	19343020	so uh if I I did much better in subjects I had an interest in of course
19347260	19354220	and other times I would be like uh no I'm oh I although I did quite well for subjects I
19354220	19357420	did had no interest in I still forced myself to be interested
19357660	19366940	so yeah uh honestly if anyone has like studying techniques or anything and they ask me I just
19366940	19377340	like uh work in the bathroom I don't know I I was I'm weird I'm a little weirdo
19378060	19388060	I'm a little weirdo and so yeah I I like honestly I genuinely like studying as well
19397340	19400780	so yeah mercy solution is simple don't have ADHD
19402940	19405260	yeah only have diet ADHD
19408300	19413420	but yeah I'm I'm a little bit strange I'm a little bit loopy I guess
19416860	19421100	but yeah I I I can hyper fixate on something real fast
19426700	19427340	so yeah
19429900	19433820	uh yeah studying tip for me probably really fucking useless
19438220	19440220	yeah
19447180	19452220	yeah that's why we like you is because I'm a I'm a little weirdo I'm a little freak

19523660	19529500	uh next week I'm going to probably have a very small schedule as well
19530460	19537740	um just so I can I can get like a lot of things done I still have a lot of a lot of chores and
19537740	19545180	I need some days to just relax by myself or relax with some friends as well so I
19545180	19549580	I need a few more days off to do chores and then also like have some time

19633500	19638860	in harvester and we pick up a new game like another new game
