1
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:23,240
all

2
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,640
Sorry.

3
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,740
Sorry!

4
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:41,060
Sorry!

5
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:47,720
Sorry, senpai!

6
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,520
Sorry, supplies!

7
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,720
It's okay, supplies!

8
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:10,420
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, sorry, supplies!

9
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:17,420
I had my, I had my, I had my weekly breakdown just before stream!

10
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,420
Ugh, I tried my best.

11
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,420
I like, I like, did it, uh, I didn't cry.

12
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Or like, oh shit, I don't remember which slot I saved in.

13
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:09,420
Uh, I like, uh, I didn't cry.

14
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,420
And then the moment I hit live, I like, transition, I was like, ah, fuck.

15
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:22,420
Just wait till I'm on my 19th, 19th nervous breakdown.

16
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:29,420
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

17
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Oh yeah.

18
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Or I gotta keep like, which one is the one that I saved in?

19
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,420
Oh, no data, okay, okay, yeah, okay.

20
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I think I know which one, we're in, we're in this one.

21
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:49,420
So, yeah, let's load this file.

22
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,420
Look at those weekly hands!

23
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
I took my Walsh's sickness meds, yeah.

24
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,420
About half an hour before stream started.

25
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,420
I'm looking at a moon.

26
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,420
Ugh, okay.

27
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,420
Do I remember how this works?

28
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,420
Okay, that's movements.

29
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,420
Yes, okay.

30
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,420
Press A, hold A to continue.

31
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,420
Yes, yes, yes, I forgot!

32
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Has your rash been feeling better?

33
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:42,420
Yeah, except for my doctor was like, except for now I'm starting at my rashes.

34
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,420
On my legs and my other arm.

35
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:56,420
And now I have an appointment with a dermatologist.

36
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Yeah.

37
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Wait, which way was I supposed to go?

38
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,420
I can't remember.

39
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,420
Oh, shit.

40
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
I can have your skin.

41
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:24,420
Here, I'll peel it off gently with a carving knife.

42
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,420
Oh, shit, was it this?

43
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
No, it was the other way.

44
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:38,420
It was the other way, tee-hee.

45
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Boiler room.

46
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Okay, let's see if I remember.

47
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,420
You happen to have any items from this level so far?

48
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
I don't remember.

49
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,420
Let's check.

50
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Oh, items.

51
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,420
I have the firing equipeted.

52
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,420
I have some bloods.

53
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,420
And here's all the smiths.

54
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,420
I like using Dan the most because he's, he shoots fast.

55
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:17,420
He shoots at fast.

56
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:29,420
What the fuck is this?

57
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,420
F.

58
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,420
U.

59
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,420
Okay.

60
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Input error.

61
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,420
Wait, was there a hint somewhere?

62
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,420
Was there a hint?

63
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:54,420
Oh, shit, reload.

64
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
Bit rude.

65
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,420
Was there a hint somewhere?

66
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,420
I like hints.

67
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,420
Whoa.

68
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
Yeah.

69
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
Wait, where is it?

70
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Oh, yeah, there we go.

71
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
Oh, mommy.

72
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Mommy, welcome to the stream Raiders.

73
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,420
There's an A.

74
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Got drunk.

75
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Good night, Mercy.

76
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,420
I love you, dear child.

77
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
She's so fucking drunk.

78
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Oh, no.

79
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Sampai.

80
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,420
Sampai.

81
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,420
Thank you for the 420, sending ton of love your way, Mercy.

82
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,420
You've continually been making my last few weeks better.

83
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
So thanks for that.

84
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,420
I also happen to be a resident of Manto, Illinois,

85
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,420
but you've helped bring me some stability

86
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,420
and something to look forward to more days.

87
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Thank you.

88
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
Sampai's too.

89
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Sampai's too.

90
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,420
Oh, my gosh.

91
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Thank you for the five gifted.

92
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:19,420
Bui.

93
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,420
I was like, I was like,

94
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:31,420
oh, here's my like,

95
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,420
here's my like breakdown again.

96
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Is there, is there something to do with these lights

97
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,420
or are they just there?

98
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
We can do okay.

99
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Oh.

100
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,420
I don't know where K is in the alphabet.

101
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
Okay.

102
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,420
No.

103
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Wait.

104
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,420
It's not ZK, is it?

105
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
It's not in ZK.

106
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,420
That would be so funny.

107
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,420
You see where the text says ISZK?

108
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,420
That would be so funny.

109
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Oh, thank goodness it's not.

110
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,420
It would be so funny, but thank goodness it's not.

111
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,420
I know it's like, oh, we can totally,

112
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
we can totally brute force this,

113
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:42,420
but I want to solve it.

114
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:58,420
I want to solve it, Sampai.

115
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,420
Oh, well, I'm so stupid.

116
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,420
I remember.

117
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
I remember.

118
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Okay.

119
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
Yeah, we were, we were here.

120
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
I understand.

121
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
It was no understood.

122
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,420
It was no.

123
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
There you go.

124
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Wow.

125
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
I for gore.

126
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
I for gore, Sampai.

127
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,420
I for gore.

128
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:28,420
It's been, what, like since last week?

129
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Nampai.

130
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,420
Nampai.

131
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,420
Thank you for the super chat.

132
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Chrono time.

133
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
Thank you.

134
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,420
You make the long days better.

135
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Thank you, Mercy.

136
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,420
I for gore.

137
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
Correct input.

138
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Lock deactivated.

139
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,420
This is my fault for like,

140
00:18:49,420 --> 00:19:01,420
what's the word?

141
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Oh, hey.

142
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:22,420
Oh, wait, it's different than a duplicate.

143
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:28,420
It's an evolved heaven smile with boosted explosive power.

144
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,420
You got to take it out before it gets too close.

145
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
They're crazy.

146
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
I'm telling you.

147
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,420
They'll be on top of you the moment you open the damn door.

148
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Wait, can you say that again?

149
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:53,420
With this time, like more, more sash, sashual?

150
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Okay.

151
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
This is where the queen is.

152
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,420
It's different than a duplicate.

153
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,420
An evolved heaven smile with boosted explosive power.

154
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,420
You got to take it out before it gets too close.

155
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
They're crazy.

156
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,420
I'm telling you.

157
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,420
They'll be on top of you the moment you open the door.

158
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Well, shit, stairs.

159
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:42,420
Senpai, I might be fucking stupid.

160
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,420
I might be fucking stupid.

161
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,420
He said a door.

162
00:20:49,420 --> 00:21:00,420
As soon as you get through the door, there was no fucking door.

163
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,420
I was like, what fucking door?

164
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,420
I'm going back.

165
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:16,420
I forgot how to heal.

166
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:25,420
Blood recovery.

167
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Okay, there we go.

168
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:38,420
Okay.

169
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,420
Door equals stairs.

170
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:55,420
When he said door, I was like, oh, door, door, not stairs, corridor.

171
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Fuck.

172
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,420
Fuck.

173
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
Am I kind of stupid?

174
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
Yes.

175
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:24,420
I didn't realize there was another corridor.

176
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
Which?

177
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
Which one?

178
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,420
There you are.

179
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,420
Okay, we're good.

180
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,420
I'm baffled by angles.

181
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,420
Can I go into Hyraman's room?

182
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Oh.

183
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
Hi.

184
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm on a go to the television now.

185
00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:05,420
And please take the blood.

186
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,420
I can't save here, but I have some serum.

187
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:13,420
So I can...

188
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,420
I want to use my skills.

189
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Let's do some...

190
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,420
I think I should put in criticals now.

191
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Yeah, yeah, fuck you.

192
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Yeah, I can do counter attacks.

193
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:43,420
And speed or waver or power.

195
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:58,420
Waver is the wiggliness.

196
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:11,420
No, no, I don't have enough to have more power.

197
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:17,420
Maybe less wiggly, so we'll do the waver.

198
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,420
Okay.

199
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Counter attack.

200
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:29,420
Okay, cool.

201
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:39,420
No, I did not.

202
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:59,420
Okay, we need any more blood now.

203
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
Ah, shit, which...

204
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
Which way did I go?

205
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,420
I forgot again.

206
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:24,420
Whoo!

207
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,420
The other way, wasn't it?

208
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:38,420
It was the other way.

209
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,420
Oh my gosh.

210
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,420
You scared me, bondage son.

211
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,420
Iwa, Iwazaru.

212
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,420
Master, we're in a tight spot.

213
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,420
Things are turning in a bad way.

214
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,420
An infamous criminal lies this way.

215
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,420
And he's protecting him.

216
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,420
Wicked bad partners, indeed, indeed.

217
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,420
Ah, yes.

218
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Seek out the soul shells.

219
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,420
With soul shells.

220
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:21,420
He was sure to allow you in the name of Harman.

221
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:27,420
I didn't read that fast.

222
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,420
How fucked am I, Senpai?

223
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
Wait.

224
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,420
Let me go back.

225
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,420
Again.

226
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
And...

227
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:50,420
Iwazaru, I need to look at the instructions again.

228
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:59,420
Okay, master, blah blah blah.

229
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Blood is scary stuff.

230
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,420
Without blood, there is no tomorrow.

231
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,420
Because how do I do the special again?

232
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Personas can absorb the blood out of the enemy.

233
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,420
Access stabilizer to help handle multiple personalities.

234
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Without blood, your very life is in danger.

235
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:28,420
Press start slash pause to check blood volume.

236
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,420
You must use blood wisely in the name of Harman.

237
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,420
Special aim plus Y button three times plus shoot.

238
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,420
Oh yeah!

239
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:43,420
Let me just refresh it again anyways.

240
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:50,420
Yeah, Dan's special attacks.

241
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,420
Okay, Helian Dan loves destruction.

242
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,420
He's bound to destroy the enemy's nest.

243
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Press the Y button three times.

244
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,420
Holding the gun with the R button.

246
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,420
Free test tubes will be equipped.

247
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
Use the A button to launch a demon shell.

248
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Got it, got it, got it.

249
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,420
The red and yellow cores indicate the nest's weak points.

250
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
The name of Harman.

251
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:25,420
Oh, whoa, whoa.

252
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:31,420
I'm starting to remember slowly.

253
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,420
It was this holly.

254
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:51,420
Where's the yellow? Oh, there it is.

255
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,420
That was just me practicing, yeah.

256
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:13,420
Yeah.

257
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,420
Hello.

258
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,420
Gatekeeper.

259
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,420
Gatekeeper, girl boss, gaslet.

260
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Hi.

261
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Next please.

262
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,420
Where to?

263
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,420
Do the vinculum gate?

264
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,420
Let me take those.

265
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,420
Yes, R received.

266
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:51,420
Go right inside.

267
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:59,420
Nah, I got it.

268
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Lost fight.

269
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,420
Fuck it.

270
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:17,420
Wait, this music poppin'.

271
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:40,420
Yeah.

272
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:47,420
It's a pop.

273
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Hello.

274
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,420
Hi, it was Aru.

275
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,420
Master, we're in a tight spot.

276
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Ain't even funny how tight it is.

277
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,420
Once you open the door, there's no turning back, master.

278
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:16,420
Well, you can come back, but I mean that's the gravity of the situation.

279
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Don't get me wrong.

280
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,420
Like a prelude to later battles, you know?

281
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,420
You must take it very seriously.

282
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:45,420
The name of Harmon.

283
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
Please help me.

284
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
That monster is quick as lightning.

285
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,420
I tried my best to run away,

286
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,420
but it caught up with me anyway.

287
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,420
Hey, kill it before it explodes.

288
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,420
No, I'm gonna die again today.

289
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Somebody please help.

290
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Should I?

291
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Here we go.

292
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,420
Shit, shit. Wow, speed smile, huh?

293
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Oh, shit.

294
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Oh, shit.

295
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,420
Oh, shit.

296
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Oh, shit.

297
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,420
Oh, shit.

298
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Oh, shit.

299
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:40,420
So we better go to Harmon's room.

300
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,420
Okay, okay, okay.

301
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Spot A.

302
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:54,420
Yes, we overwrite this file.

303
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,420
We need anything else?

304
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Probably not, but I do have a save file just in case.

305
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:15,420
Let's get in.

306
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Permission to help if you need it, only if I need it.

307
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,420
They got cameras.

308
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Wait.

309
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Am I gonna be okay?

310
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Is Garcia gonna be okay?

311
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Hello talk. Oh, there you are.

312
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
Don't be shy, Amir.

313
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,420
Who would have figured you'd be the only survivor?

314
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,420
Anyways, are you getting along with the chief?

315
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,420
Straight up, I was waiting for you the whole time.

316
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,420
Yeah, I know.

317
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,420
Don't be mad at me, man.

318
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,420
Don't glare at me like that.

319
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,420
The chief will wake up.

320
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,420
Really, I'm sorry.

321
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,420
The other chief must be rolling on the floor with laughter.

322
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,420
Hello talk.

323
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Vision ring? What does vision ring do?

324
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:39,420
I think we'll be fine to understand what he's doing.

325
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,420
Vision ring is how you scan for enemies.

326
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,420
Wasn't that what I was doing?

327
00:35:50,420 --> 00:36:08,420
Which side should I go first?

328
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,420
There's two hallways now.

329
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,420
Large hall?

330
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,420
Hmm?

331
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,420
Wait, who the fuck is this?

332
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,420
Samantha's sitcom.

333
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,420
Not sitcom?

334
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,420
Please, be careful, sir.

335
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Where did she come from?

336
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,420
Am I holding a giant harman?

337
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,420
That's the harman?

338
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,420
I'm the mother of this sacred place.

339
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,420
Our four children served their purpose.

340
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,420
They didn't die.

341
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,420
But our other nine children were killed by you.

342
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,420
What do you want from us?

343
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,420
Is it so bad that we have a purpose in life?

344
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,420
We are only serving our gods.

345
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,420
At Heaven's command, we will kill the unwanted.

346
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,420
Let's get rid of bad trees from their roots.

347
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,420
I hope you are not one of them.

348
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:33,420
A white child gets past your bedtime.

349
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,420
Oh my gosh.

350
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:50,420
Holy shit, he's got a huge gun.

351
00:37:50,420 --> 00:38:05,420
Is this locking on?

352
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,420
You think you killed me?

353
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
Better think again.

354
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,420
You have a different voice!

355
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
You have a what?

356
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:24,420
There's faces on your back!

357
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:47,420
Wait, I can move!

358
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Bye!

359
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,420
I can move!

360
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Kind of creepy.

361
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:52,420
Bye!

362
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,420
Yes!

363
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:04,420
I got one of them!

364
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,420
Yes!

365
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:18,420
Got another one!

366
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:25,420
Come on, come on.

367
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:36,420
No wait, too soon.

368
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:52,420
Oh shit!

369
00:40:52,420 --> 00:41:01,420
Come on.

370
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:21,420
I'll go!

371
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,420
Yes!

372
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:36,420
One more!

373
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:51,420
Not one.

374
00:41:51,420 --> 00:42:01,420
There we go.

375
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:19,420
Oh shit.

376
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:26,420
Revolver moment!

377
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:40,420
It's not easy to aim like this.

378
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Yes, we got it!

379
00:42:47,420 --> 00:43:04,420
Ah!

380
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:10,420
Is this the way?

381
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:16,420
Oh look, I'm wheeling!

382
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:36,420
They see me rolling, they hate me, they're trolling.

383
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:42,420
Again!

384
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I thought I killed you, bitch!

385
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:58,420
Hi, slot!

386
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,420
Oh sorry, I forgot I had to hold this.

387
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Who's that thing popping around?

388
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:25,420
Where's the guy?

389
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:34,420
Got it.

390
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:40,420
Alright, guy from Tekken.

391
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:52,420
Ah yes, nothing has changed for 30 years, no matter how many times you try, the result will be the same.

392
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:59,420
Ah yes, like our chess games, you always seem to win.

393
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:15,420
You're a bad player, senpai.

394
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:28,420
You're a good friend, but unfortunately, our interest is not mutual.

395
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:36,420
We both have become burdened with so much, and we don't have time for fun anymore.

396
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,420
There's always time for fun.

397
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:57,420
Let's dance.

398
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,420
Did I hit his hand?

399
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:08,420
Oh weeeeee! Why did he fly?

400
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:22,420
Why did he fly like that?

401
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:28,420
Okay!

402
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,420
What's a PDA again?

403
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:39,420
What's a PDA again?

404
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,420
Personnel device something?

405
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,420
Personnel digital assistant, thank you. Personnel display.

406
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,420
Angel complete! We finished!

407
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,420
Exterminated heaven smile.

408
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:07,420
Okay, that's okay.

409
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:14,420
The day when laughter disappears from this world draws near.

410
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,420
Continue to sunset.

411
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,420
I was three off from the coveted number.

412
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,420
No laughs?

413
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:35,420
Oh yeah, I didn't laugh this time.

414
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:45,420
Almost funny number means it wasn't funny, therefore I didn't laugh.

415
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:54,420
2010 winter.

416
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:59,420
Look I can move these, look I can move it.

417
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:04,420
Is that sunset?

418
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,420
Not funny, didn't laugh.

419
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,420
Is that red moon?

420
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,420
May I ask you to think about these?

421
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,420
Think about what?

422
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:30,420
Is it these nuts?

423
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:38,420
I feel like that was a lie.

424
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:47,420
Oh.

425
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,420
Wait, that sounds nice.

426
00:48:52,420 --> 00:49:07,420
Wait, that sounds fine.

427
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,420
Wait, ideology?

428
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:21,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no.

429
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,420
That's not peace!

430
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:33,420
In the year 2002, a network of intercontinental expressways bridging the Atlantic Ocean opened,

431
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,420
connecting the two major sides of the world.

432
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,420
We have to drive

433
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:47,700
The construction of a mass-scale distribution system began and the man-made landmass as large as a city

434
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,140
Was built over an ocean

435
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:59,220
The use and research of nuclear energy was banned and all radioactive waste and materials were disposed of where at an energy

436
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:05,340
Disposal facility in the Gibbs soft islands. Is that good set of islands off the coast of the Indian Ocean

437
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:13,580
Is this anime international eyes were on the elimination of the intercontinental missiles that posed the biggest threat to world peace

438
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,700
In order to eliminate these weapons of mass destruction

439
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:23,660
They were launched outside the Earth's atmosphere and intercepted by other missiles

440
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,380
Exploding them on contact

441
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:33,300
People around the world watch these explosions light up the sky as if they were some kind of dazzling light show

442
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:41,580
These explosions later known as the missile show missiles became the symbol of world peace

443
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:47,380
Wait, isn't that kind of violent for a world peace new threat was on the rise

444
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:58,660
At the signing ceremony of the UN's world security treaty in the year 2003 a new breed of terrorists who called themselves

445
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,620
smiling faces

446
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,620
The devastating attack caught the international society by surprise and

447
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,180
temporarily crippled key operations in the United Nations

448
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:18,220
That assault was aimed at nothing other than using terrorism to create terror

449
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,460
Well fear spread throughout the nations like people die when they are killed

450
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,300
There was nothing the police of the military could do to counter the smiling faces

451
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,980
The only one who had any chance of stopping these smiling faces

452
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,580
Were the omniscient and almost godlike professional assassins

453
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:45,500
The key players behind the scenes of the four powers utilized their connections and called upon the group known as

454
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,460
Killer seven

455
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:59,340
Their only hope rested with them. Oh my gosh, they title dropped it

456
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,380
Yes, the election is right. Yeah, have you decided on your vote? Yeah

457
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,620
Have a nice day

458
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,020
Yeah, right that's cinnamon toast crunch

459
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,380
What the fuck was that

460
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,300

Mercy door stuck door stuck please let us out. Well, why would I do that?

488

Done wait, look at this. Yeah, we're looking what is this a bug in the system. No, sir

Disappear off the map. Do you have the impact point yet? Yes, sir. It's Japan. What are the fireworks ready?

493
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:28,420
No, forget it. Japan is our ally. No, we're not authorized to make that kind of decision forget authorization

494
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:34,900
We have to do something now or else. We goodbye Japan happen get the president on the line

495
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,540
This is an emergency call for the president

496
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,700
Mr. President this is Spencer speaking sir

497
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:54,580
200 pulsars have been fired towards Japan. We're unable to compute their trajectory since we're avoiding the computation time lag

498
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:00,020
Interception can only commence two hours before initial impact

499
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:07,540
Should we launch the fireworks mr. President your assessment, sir

500

Oh, I got a nice card. What'd you say restaurant Fukushima? It's a popular joint

506
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,340
The owner of the place Toro Fukushima

507
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,820
See he's the middleman between the Japanese UN representatives in our government

508
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,380
Government job

509
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:32,660
That's a job from all the parties. Japan is turned against us. So that's why they're gonna hit Japan

510
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,700
It depends on how they move it'll be a blow all right

511

What will happen to Japan?

512

515
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,740

This skill is extraordinary. The thief is a ruthless villain

599
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:22,740
Use the white button while holding the gun with the R button

600
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,060
And use one test tube this creates a custom magnum shell

601
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,820
Sure, it's banned by international treaties

602
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,580
But it's just the thing to take out the enemy

603
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,300
In the name of harman

604
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:44,180

01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,260
We're in a tight spot

609
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:06,500
The skill is extraordinary. The mask man has strange powers

610
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,060
Use the white button while holding the launcher with the R button

01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,340
Eh, yeah, yeah

615
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:39,540
Master this is bad bad news. There's no way to talk

616
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,700
You inflame blame the enemy

617
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,900
The solve matters

618
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:52,100
You must get in their face draw them closer the moment the enemy flashes

619
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,300
Press the X button for critical

620
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,820
Oh, okay

621
01:09:56,820 --> 01:10:03,220
Do it right and you understand why you guys are not to be messed with in the name of harman. Okay, okay

Master this is bad, I mean really bad

624
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,460
You have to power up our personas weapons persona

625
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,660
Or the enemies will have the best of us

626
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,380
Rumor has it

627
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,620
Some enemies don't explode

628
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,460
Keep taking the hordes out

629
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:40,500
And heightened consciousness level up like there's no tomorrow with boosted weapons the enemies will shudder with fear

630
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,180
The name of harman

631
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,580
Oh

632
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,740
Not gonna lie

633
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:58,500
Senpai, uh, I was seeing screenshots of smt-5 vengeance

634
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,460
Vengeance is a vengeance

635
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,660
Uh, whatever the apocalypse one and I was just like

636
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,660
Oh

637
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:11,860
Shit, I kind of want it, but then I'm also like oh, but like five I got really dizzy and I couldn't play it

638
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,820
So I don't know. I don't know. I I have mixed feelings

639
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,100
I I have mixed feelings about it, you know

640
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:27,940
I have mixed feelings it got it gave me motion sickness, but I might be able to do it if there's no motion if I can do it again

641
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:38,180
Yeah, motion sickness strikes again, I think I liked four because it was on the ds

642
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,140
I

643
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,940
About smt-3 remaster

644
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:50,900
Did that game give you motion sickness? Oh, not as much. It didn't give me as much motion sickness

645
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:57,380
But but I wasn't really moving in this like kind of open world thing. I guess

646
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,460
So, yeah

647
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,780
So does playing in windowed mode help? Um

648
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:17,380
Not really not really to be honest

649
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,020
Um

650
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,620
Not really

651
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:34,020
It doesn't matter what side I think a smaller screen is better though, but it's still kind of like oh, I'm still kind of dizzy, you know

652
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:40,660
Um, I don't like smt-3 that much because it's really punishing and hard

653
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:47,380
I'm a baby. I'm a baby when it comes to gaming. I want my games to be relaxing and easy

654
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,700
so that's why I play on easy mode and then

655
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:55,380
Don't tell other smt fans that I play on easy mode because it's uh

656
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:00,820
I like I like I like relaxing and going with the story and then

657
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,820

658
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:08,740
SMT fans will be like, why aren't you playing it on hard? Why are you playing it hard? What is wrong with you?

659
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,260

01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,340
Perfect for long tracks

664
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,860

Now so uh, I have to hold it on my arm so I can't play the game until it's like iced again

700
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,820
So everyone

701
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,580
Why do you always play ping pong? Why is it ping pong?

702
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,500
Settle in for some yapping. Yeah, we'll do a little bit of yapping

703
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:24,900
Before I continue well, I'll put this back back down by the sink and then if I need it again, I'll just pick it up again

704
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:28,100
so um

705
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:33,140
Yeah, my arm is very very very itchy. It looks so much better

706
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,700
Than it did like two days ago

707
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:38,580
Senpai like two days ago

708
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,420
It looks so bad. It looks so bad. I was like

709
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:50,580
Luckily all the games I was playing were like super easy or like could be played with one hand

710
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,340
Like you know

711
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:04,180
Any like walking stuff or like visual novels. It's just like dun dun dun dun dun. This one requires me to be actually you know

712
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:07,540
Good

713
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:10,740
So

714
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:19,700
Um, I was able to like rest my ice pack beside me and then kind of like just play with one hand

715
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,900
But um

716
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:33,780
Maybe you should change the schedule then uh, I still want to play killer seven

717
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:40,580
We'll just have to ice it so my arms when they flare up like they get so hot

718
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:45,780
That the ice melts that the ice melts and I can't even feel that the ice pack is cold

719
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:49,780
But if I put it like on my leg or something it's it's like oh, it's cold

720
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,500
But it feels like

721
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,340
It's not

722
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,340
When I put it on

723
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,340
It doesn't even feel cold

724
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,500
Uh

725
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:07,460
Fortunately killer seven isn't very intense. Yeah, it's not intense, but I it still requires two hands

726
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:22,900
But um, yeah, the doctor was checking the rest of my body to see if uh

727
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,340
Uh

728
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:30,900
If she could see if there were any anywhere else that it happened and she's like, oh, yeah, you got some on your legs

729
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:32,980
and

730
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:36,740
Uh, as I was at the doctor, I was like rashing up on the other side

731
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:40,260
On the other arm. I was like, ah

732
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:47,380
You know, I have a fever call. Hi. That's the first thing I checked. The first thing I checked was okay now. It's cold. Um

733
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:49,380
Um

734
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:54,820
The first thing I checked and mama mama mercy checked was uh

735
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,180
Was was to see if I had a fever

736
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,340
And

737
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,300
And uh, she was like, oh no, no

738
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,140
There's no fever. So we're good there

739
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:16,340
Time to wash everything in your life. Trust me. I already did

740
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:19,460
Uh, right now my my bed sheets are in

741
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,420
the laundry

742
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:26,500
Do you ever find the cause of the rash? I have no idea. I have no idea senpai

743
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,820
I have no idea

744
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:30,820
I literally woke up

745
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:36,100
And I was like my arm's really itchy. Why and then suddenly my entire arm became

746
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,780
Like very quickly when I woke up

747
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:44,900
Became all rash and I was like panicking. I was like, oh my god. What do I do?

748
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,820
Oh

749
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,020
It's very itchy. That's probably

750
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,140
the most

751
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:03,380
Annoying part of it and it's on my dominant arm. I think the most itchiest parts are like at the wrist and the elbows

752
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,860
So that's why I was like

753
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:17,460
I took a shower just in case it was like an allergy like contact allergy and it was still there. So I was like, oh

754
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:23,780
The food allergies, um, I don't know

755
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,420
Usually if I have a food allergy, it's like the entire body

756
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:31,140
goals into

757
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:33,140
goals until like

758
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:35,140
issue

759
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,460
Maybe you have bed bugs. Um

760
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,260
highly unlikely

761
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,260
And I'm pretty because these are definitely not bites because I went to the doctor

762
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:49,060
She was like, oh, yeah allergies is definitely something allergy related

763
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:56,740
Um, do you use ac? Uh, no, actually it's been quite cold recently

764
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:00,420
No changes in washing detergents or anything. No

765
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,660
No, nothing

766
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:07,140
Thank you for the super chat charlie

767
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:10,180
I'm not reading that

768
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:16,340
Sorry not right now not right now

769
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:35,060
Maybe new clothes. Yeah. Yeah, maybe maybe it's new clothes. I mean like

770
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:39,300
It did happen when when uh, mama mercy

771
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:49,220
Mama mercy was like, oh, I'm gonna give you my old clothes

772
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:56,500
And I said, okay, so I got her old clothes that she wore when

773
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,420
Um

774
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:06,580
When she was like younger and then I guess I wore some of those and I don't know maybe

775
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:10,420
Maybe

776
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:14,420
It would have been that but it was like washed

777
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,020
That might be the reason

778
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,340
but

779
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,340
I don't know it could have been

780
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,620
the

781
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,460
Like polyester or something

782
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:30,740
But then that doesn't explain it because then I like took off the clothes

783
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:34,740
And like I haven't worn it for like days. I'm wearing my old clothes

784
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,940
Right now I'm wearing

785
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,100
A really ugly dress

786
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:44,260
This is like one of the things that I'm just like, oh, well, this shouldn't hurt

01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:49,060
So I've been wearing nothing but like 100 100 cotton t-shirts

788
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,260

Um, it can have it's like, you know the neck bombs

But for our feet, yeah, so as you always know it will be it will just remind you you can't run

Mm-hmm, but the moment you step out of those town those town boundaries or if you go underground

01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:51,700
Uh town or boonies town. Oh half and half

853
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:55,380
I guess it's kind of like normal

854
01:37:55,380 --> 01:38:10,660
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how like what normal is it has a downtown

855
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:18,660
It has a downtown and big buildings big business buildings. It's still it's still like a nice place to visit

Thank you senpai for the five super please drink response to play response to boy

858
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,260
Oh man

859
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:04,420
A principality, I don't know like it still has like malls and stuff so

860
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,700
buildings

861
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:10,820
But I don't think it's particularly huge, you know

862
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:17,620
I don't think it's particularly huge. It'll be like, I don't know. I would still consider it a town

863
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:25,220
Then again huge my differ between people

864
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:47,380
Basement is all we need. Is there a population minimum we're considering? Uh, I don't know

865
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:54,020
I don't know maybe 500,000 700,000 is a town, right?

866
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:08,660
And I trade the tracker in and instead be a house husband

867
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:12,500
I know how to cook. What can you cook? What is your best meal?

868
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:14,660

01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:16,660
okay, well

870
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,380
Make sure your liver's okay if you're drinking

871
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,300
A town is about 10% of that. Oh

872
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:28,980
Okay, then the next city over you'll have so much ability to move

873
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:44,980
I may not be able to cook but I have great credit score and stable mental health

874
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:50,340
Okay, you know what that's that's that's one up from a lot of us. I have

Can make appointments and phone calls and I can drive so I don't know one step closer

880
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:31,140

01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,500
I think

I've been called a windshield wiper. I've been called a squeaky door. I've been called a dolphin

888
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:36,020
Are you an aggressive driver? Not particularly. I consider myself a defensive driver

889
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:41,620
T kettle is what I think of I think most people say it's windshield wiper

890
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:54,820
Or like, you know, when you put windex on a cloth and go squeak squeak squeak, that's what some of my laughs sound like

891
01:42:54,820 --> 01:43:08,900
Find your laugh really cute. Thank you. I feel like it's one of my, um, charm points

892
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:13,940
Charm points? Yeah, I think it's one of my charm points

893
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:16,820
Sometimes I sound like a creaky door too

894
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,900
I

895
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:28,740
It's one of my charm points definitely something that uh people take notice of even IRL

896
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:42,500
Uh, I don't know what my other charm points are my inability to read

897
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:51,060
Okay, we're almost done Senpai. Sorry. Sorry about that

898
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:59,300
We're almost done

899
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:06,180
Oh

900
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:13,780
I think my other charm point would be

901
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:20,980
Uh, I guess maybe you've noticed I make a lot of mouth noises

902
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:26,900
A lot of mouth noises where it's like

903
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:45,620
You're also the first VTuber that plays SMT outside of persona. That's hella charming. What is my charm point the type of games I play?

904
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:59,540
That can't be that can't be it, right? My gamer scores might it's my um

905
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:04,820
It's my charm point only if you play knock turn on normal

906
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:06,980
Uh

907
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:17,380
Part of it I've never seen anyone play harvester I

908
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:24,740
Seriously, I feel like I played very early on and when I started streaming

909
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:30,500
Uh, that's such a long time ago when I say such a long time ago. That's like three years

910
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,460
three years ago, um

911
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:37,620
I

912
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:46,180
Play nothing about pointing clicks. So now I'm running out of pointing clicks. I'm running out of pointing clicks to play

913
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:54,260
I mean I could play it again, but I don't know it just loses this magic if you like play again

914
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:00,980
I mean with the crowd I think

915
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,700
I

916
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:10,100
Can't play visual novels next I have

917
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:12,900
two visual novels

918
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,900
that I want to I want to read

919
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:18,420
with senpai one is completely uh

920
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:24,420
Not great

921
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:34,020
One is completely not great and probably would be a turnoff to a lot of people, but I'm waiting for uh

922
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:37,460
Oh

923
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:42,820
It's an ad friendly. No, I'm waiting for the uh, hold on

924
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,500
Streams

925
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:51,780
And the other one I'm thinking is dona dona

926
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:54,580
Uh

927
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:06,180
But the other one is uh

928
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:10,020
Is uh

929
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:13,620
Poilet stuff

930
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:17,140
Let's just say that

931
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:25,620
It's a bit it's a funny considered the worst one of the worst vns

932
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:29,940
Ever made

933
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:36,260
It's not great, but it is comedic

934
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:47,700
It is comedic and it's really gross. It's really gross

935
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:54,260
I think some of you already know it. I see it in chat already

936
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:02,100
I see it in chat already. I think it'll be funny at least

937
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:05,060
It's gross

938
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,740
But funny

939
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:10,900
So I think that'll be an interesting stream

940
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:13,940
Definitely not one where you're like

941
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:19,220
I'm gonna jork it's more like morbid curiosity

942
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:24,180
I'm gonna I'm that's my

943
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:28,020
That's my

944
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:38,660
You know assumption my assumption

945
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:54,020
My assumption I mean like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna shame you for what you like but at the same time

946
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:56,340
I'm going to guess

947
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:58,340
It's

948
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:01,780
Not exactly like a a a a

949
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:06,660
It's one that people are going to miss out on yes, just because of the subject

950
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:16,340
Just because of the subject so I think that one is

951
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:20,580
For fun and I definitely don't expect anyone to be like

952
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:23,460
I'm I'm cumin

953
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,420
I don't expect anything

954
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:32,340
Anyone to be like I'm cumin and I'm expecting a much less big audience for that one than my other ones

955
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,460
I'm also interested in playing. Um

956
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,660
Some really gory ones

957
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:43,140
Like I think what was it megad bites bites is that one?

958
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:47,140
Uh and

959
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:49,620
I

960
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:51,940
Megan baits. Yeah baits. Yeah

961
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:57,220
Um

962
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,500
And

963
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:06,740
Maybe muvelove muvelove I hear muvelove is like one of those games that it's like a must to play

964
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:13,380
Well the stream is on the other platform be paywall. No it will not

965
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:15,780
uh

966
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:18,500
I'm planning what I'm planning for the other stream

967
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:22,660
Is uh for a little funsy onesie

968
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:31,300
Um, it's free as long as you follow because we don't want any uh, we don't want any trouble

969
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:38,020
We don't want any twubble right so it's free if you follow and uh

970
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:41,140
With some incentives

971
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:43,700
Yeah

972
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,860
With some incentives

973
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,900
For donations very uh

974
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:57,220
Interactive incentives, yes

975
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,940
But yes, it will be free

976
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:11,780
It will be free. I don't plan on like

977
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:17,060
Paywalling that it's a streaming site. I feel like it's it shouldn't be pay walled

978
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:23,380
Incentives to help keep the vibes, yeah

979
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:28,580
Yeah

980
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:31,140
Yeah, the good vibes going

981
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,620
We're free of course

982
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:41,140
Um, but you have to in my plan my plan is that you have to follow

983
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:48,420
And also, um, I don't know. I don't know but I saw a lot of people asking if like vods will be like up

984
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:55,860
Uh, you see the thing is on the other website. There is no vods. There are no vods vods do not get saved

985
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:08,180
So I don't think so

986
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:13,540
Oh, yeah, I people are like, oh, can we watch the mods for free and I'm like, I don't even think there is vods

987
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:20,020
There I don't think there is vods

988
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:29,860
Yeah, you recorded yourself. Yeah, I don't feel like that maybe

989
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:36,420
The question is where to host it. I know. Oh, yeah, uh hosting stuff seems

990
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:39,220
hard

991
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:47,620
I'll I'll I'll talk to strongy about it. I'll talk to strongy and management about it when the time comes

992
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:51,860
Because uh, right now I want to focus on my youtube stuff

993
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:57,300
I want to focus on my youtube stuff or for funsies

994
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:00,660
and also because, um

995
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:03,540
You know

996
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:07,700
In the end I do want to be seen as like sort of

997
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:14,420
Not not I don't want to be seen as

998
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:19,780
A brand risk

999
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:27,380
Oh, okay, that sounds so bad when I say it. I don't want to be seen as like a brand risk where I I might like, um

1000
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,380
Um

1001
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:39,700
I might I might cause some of my friends company to be like, no, no, you can't you can't collab with with her. I don't want that

1002
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:48,100
I don't want that. Oh, I'll wait for like 10k. Maybe I'll wait until 10k for like fans extremes. Who knows?

1003
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:00,100
So

1004
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:12,740
Yeah, I just want to be sure. Oh, what did I didn't censor? Oh man, my bad

1005
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:16,820
You didn't hear that

1006
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,540
um

1007
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:25,700
I don't want I don't want to like, uh, I don't want to make people uncomfortable, right? Like public a public facing

1008
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:27,700
I want to be seen as

1009
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:36,100
Uh pretty decent, but uh privately. I'm just uh in alternate places. Uh, we're free. We got free reign. We got free reign

1010
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:44,420
You got free reign

1011
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:53,780
You only stream on youtube. Yeah, I only stream on youtube. Yeah

1012
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:57,540
Anything that I said before that was all fake fake news

1013
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:03,460
Um

1014
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:07,300
Yeah, I just want to make sure that when it comes to corpals because I have a lot of friends

1015
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:10,020
in like different corporal

1016
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:17,860
Which I I would love to you know, uh

1017
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:25,780
It was uh

1018
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:28,580
Definitely something that I want

1019
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:33,700
I want to like hang out with my other friends and I don't want to become like a brand risk where it's like

1020
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:37,060
Oh, I can never work with my friends ever again, you know

1021
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:45,140
But I definitely don't mind having that other image. Uh

1022
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:51,460
Behind behind places where if you want that content you search for it

1023
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,500
That's kind of thing

1024
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:05,300
Viola is kind of a brand risk in itself. I think personally some pie

1025
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:10,740
I think we're really not that different from any other, uh companies

1026
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:15,780
There's a lot of companies that also do uh alternate. Um

1027
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:18,660
asmr stuff

1028
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,180
so

1029
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:22,180
I feel like um

1030
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:24,820
We're not

1031
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:27,140
Really different from any other company. Um

1032
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:35,700
The advertisement as we are a little bit on the the the spicier side. I feel like that's definitely to capture attention

1033
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:43,060
That's definitely to capture attention and we do advertise advertise it

1034
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:48,180
But that's the only difference

1035
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:50,740
I

1036
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:55,940
Don't think it's even as spicy or other corpse can get away with with it

1037
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:00,420
Yeah, it's the kind of hook

1038
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:08,340
It's a bit more I feel like it's not as spicy in my opinion

1039
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:13,220
I feel like it's quite normal

1040
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:20,980
Okay, okay, um senpai's I'm gonna have to go up again and put away the ice pack because it's completely melted here

1041
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:23,620
It's completely melted

1042
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:26,680
So I'm gonna put it back in the freezer

1043
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:45,220
So

1044
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,220
So

1045
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:45,220
So

1046
01:58:53,940 --> 01:58:58,420
Senpai's playing games here, okay now we now we're gaming

1047
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:07,320
Now we're gaming I'm sorry about the long intermission senpai. Sorry about the long intermission

1048
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:15,720
Yeah, it looks like I I'll be able to continue playing

1049
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,880
Okay, we're gonna game we're gaming

1050
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:37,640
I need to click on the screen

1051
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:42,120
There it is

1052
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:45,400
But yeah

1053
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:47,800
Fruitful fruitful conversation. I hope I hope

1054
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:52,120
That's my plan. Um, at least that's my plan

1055
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:54,680
but if uh

1056
01:59:54,760 --> 02:00:00,760
If management's like no or if scrawny's like, I don't know then uh all that plan gone

1057
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,200
All that plan is gone

1058
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,440
Or our might change a bit

1059
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:10,200
Coyote

1060
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,200
master

1061
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:14,360
In a tight spot

1062
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,800
The skill is extraordinary the thief loves high places

1063
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:21,640
You can jump like a human flea damn

1064
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,520
Shall I say a master of trespassing?

1065
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,040
Press the y button to use it

1066
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:32,440
In the name of harman

1067
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:39,080
Okay, so this is me anything else combat. Okay, we're good

1068
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:43,400
It might take a little bit getting used to these guys

1069
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:55,640
Idea I thought the only idea was youtube. Yeah. Yeah, you're getting it senpai

1070
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:59,560
You get it

1071
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:05,800
Ah everything's on fire the length I took should have waiting room

1072
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:13,480
Shit

1073
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:19,880
Why are you so fast?

1074
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,040
Oh

1075
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,360
He ran away

1076
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:49,560
Oh we did it

1077
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:53,080
Again

1078
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:56,120
How many are you?

1079
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:02,120
I

1080
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:09,000
Like it when you crawl wait, there's more

1081
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:32,280
Yeah

1082
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:38,280
Why didn't it go? Okay

1083
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:51,720
Oh hi travis. I'll carry your pigeon. Hold on. Let me look at that one

1084
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,200
Oh

1085
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:07,000
Dear amir, this is a warning amir transfer hundred dollars in my account. I'm absorbing a twenty five dollar loss final offer. All right, mary

1086
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:13,800
Nothing terrible has happened yet

1087
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:19,320
It's time for you to send the money consider it a gift for me to use surprisingly the smith syndicate has many talents

1088
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:25,720
And I ain't talking about cheap tricks like swallowing goldfish or cramming your head into a rubber glove

1089
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:30,280
They're on a whole other plane. I saw it with my own eyes heroes for our age

1090
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,320
dan smith is a straight out of

1091
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,880
japanime

1092
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:42,680
Launching balls of light and shit. Yeah, you bet it blew my socks off. Heck. I wanted to shake his hand and ask for an autograph

1093
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:48,680
But I decided to put my life first

1094
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,320
Oh

1095
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:57,000
Kai day smith sports blood from her arms

1096
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:03,400
What a sick sight and then what did she do? She flattened a wall right before my eyes. She must have taken out some kind of barrier

1097
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,520
That's what kai day's blood can do

1098
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:12,920
Sometimes her arms suck blood. That's some stuff. I didn't need to see either

1099
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,200
Masked a smith is still a mystery

1100
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:19,320
But I do know that he can do some sweet wrestling moves

1101
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:24,200
He was a small town pro wrestler who drew crowds to main events

1102
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:29,080
But just before he made his debut in the new york scene. He mysteriously disappeared

1103
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:32,040
This is common knowledge amongst fans

1104
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:40,360
The only thing for sure is that there's more than meets the eye and updated an update will follow johnny gar gegner gegner

1105
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,600
gegner

1106
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:45,480
Contain your ear

1107
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:54,360
Where

1108
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:57,080
Son of a bitch

1109
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:02,120
I'm in the middle of talking here

1110
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Do you mind if I tell you straight up

1111
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:13,240
I heard it through the grapevine number one chief. You're not the only one after the owner of this joint

1112
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:18,120
The pan is controlled by the nash united nations party

1113
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:21,160
The un party goes down

1114
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:25,000
Pan's minority party will take control

1115
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:29,640
In other words the liberal party will take the reins

1116
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,160
There's some nasty shit cooking in this restaurant

1117
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:38,520
And it ain't mama's fried chicken

1118
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:45,320
The thief from south america could climb in this in a in a jiffy

1119
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,480
What's the

1120
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,880
So

1121
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:14,040
How many are there

1122
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:31,960
Oh, come on out again

1123
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:37,240
I

1124
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,400
Shit is it behind me

1125
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,400
I forgot how to do a quick turn senpai

1126
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:05,080
Yeah

1127
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:07,880

1128
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:10,840
Be button

1129
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:13,320
All right, I'm kind of dumb

1130
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:17,400
I'm kind of dumb

1131
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:20,860
It's fine maybe

1132
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:33,480
Oops

1133
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:38,440
Oh, we got the body already nice

1134
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:55,000
Look i'm a cleaner I can feel no remorse. Okay body to me. It's nearly as a wreck riding flesh a bud

1135
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I

1136
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:06,200
Yay

1137
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:08,840

02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:29,240
Okay, we're gonna put some blood in I'm gonna have to level up guys. I think I'm gonna have to level up

1139
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:31,960
You

1140
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,160
You must defeat three enemies to wake him up

1141
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:42,920
And judge I'll take care of them

1142
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:45,240
You

1143
02:08:56,040 --> 02:09:00,600
Okay, fine, we'll use him this is kind of hard

1144
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,920
I

1145
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:22,280
Maybe I should go back

1146
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:37,960
Oh, he's so slow

1147
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:45,800
Fuck it

1148
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:57,480
I wanted to use the the the the sneaking thing

1149
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:17,240
Didn't get any blood see like I

1150
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,360
I have no one

1151
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:44,920
Oh

1152
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:18,360
The ego has landed on the roof

1153
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:35,480
Anyone else

1154
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:45,320
Oh

1155
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:00,760
Can I use the blood to heal

1156
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:15,240
Oh

1157
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:21,400
Was it oh, hi

1158
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:32,280
Well, hello Smith raining today, isn't it you know what I never go to school when it rains

1159
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,080
But my mom doesn't understand

1160
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:40,120
Stupid mom without her reasons

1161
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:44,920
She says go to school. So I jumped down from the second floor

1162
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:54,440
In that calm that's a compound fracture my new pulverized them all splat absolutely faux barred

1163
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:58,760
Took six months to heal. I got to take half a year off from school

1164
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:05,560
Whoopee you forgot this didn't you?

1165
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Watering returned

1166
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:20,520
Not a single classmate came to visit me in the hospital

1167
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:25,080
Well, what about her of course she didn't come

1168
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:28,680
She jumped with me

1169
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:35,720
And I landed on top of her like the coolest thing, you know, I'll leave the rest of your imagination

1170
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:39,240
My imagination of a killer

1171
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:44,760
Okay, bye

Mom okay, I don't think mom's okay

1175
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:15,020
I have a I have a slight feeling that mommy is not okay

1176
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:17,020

02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:33,580
Okay, hold on there's probably some guy

02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:24,700
Did you just say you're fucked

1183
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:28,060
Because I felt that

1184
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:34,140
The hallway was I supposed to go into again? That's not the right one is it?

1185
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:40,300
Oh, yeah here it is courtyard

02:16:55,020 --> 02:17:00,620
A blood red flower is gonna go up like a firework like tears in her in the rain

1193
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:04,940
Enough to the owner Fukushima to prevent it from hitting and killing everybody

1194
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:10,780
So chief which side are you on the homeland or japan?

1195
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:16,380
If you kill the owner japan goes down the toilet

1196
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:21,980
Are you all right with that man careful of the new enemy type

1197

1237
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:28,100

02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:38,740
Wow, I didn't have that much blood dang it

1239
02:24:43,380 --> 02:24:45,380

Wait, can I go back in there can I farm blood here?

1241
02:25:12,380 --> 02:25:14,380
Oh

1242
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:32,340

1243
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:41,000
No, I need to abilities down attack charge shot

1244
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:44,540
Judge I'll take care of them

1245
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:49,820
You need more speed you need more speed you definitely need more speed

1246
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:05,860
Okay, I can't farm anymore they knew my methods

1247
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:11,540
They knew my method

1248
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:14,380
I

1249
02:26:23,420 --> 02:26:25,420
Pardon

1250
02:26:36,220 --> 02:26:38,220
Went over there

1251
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:44,380
Oh

1252
02:27:12,580 --> 02:27:14,580
Mask

1253
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:18,220
Mask maybe

1254
02:27:27,860 --> 02:27:30,740
No, hi there

1255
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:47,980
I'm a ghost kind of girls

1256
02:27:55,220 --> 02:27:57,220
Area destroyed

1257
02:28:01,580 --> 02:28:07,780
Should I change it I'm gonna change it just in case there's like a big boss there

1258
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:14,540
Oh

1259
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:22,540
Egg me Dan here

1260
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:39,500
Oh shit

1261
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:44,740
Son of a bitch

1262
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:56,020
We're fine

1263
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:03,220
I'm fine

1264
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:06,020
If you have a minute to share good share

1265
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:09,460
It could open your eyes

1266
02:29:10,220 --> 02:29:12,420
Pan doesn't have its own defense system

1267
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:21,220
Its survival is contingent in the United States as far as the homeland is concerned Japan is extra baggage

1268
02:29:22,180 --> 02:29:24,940
Its usefulness as an ally is long past

1269
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:28,540
Straight up it ain't worth saving you see

1270
02:29:30,340 --> 02:29:33,820
That's reality for you so chief you still gonna do it

1271
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:36,020
You

1272
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:42,860
Know what it's meant by fireworks. They're missiles explosion that occur when missiles

1273
02:29:43,460 --> 02:29:46,460
Collide oh sure. It's a beautiful sight indeed

1274
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:50,340
But you'll only see it if the defense system is activated

1275
02:29:53,180 --> 02:29:58,980
Really I went all the way here and all I got was Travis a

1276
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:03,260
Haha travesty

1277
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:05,820
If you will

1278
02:30:28,660 --> 02:30:31,500
What the fuck is that spiral smile

1279
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:36,820
I like it

1280
02:30:44,860 --> 02:30:46,860
We got it

1281
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:54,620
Oh shit

1282
02:31:03,860 --> 02:31:07,300
It's too far away from the

1283
02:31:09,580 --> 02:31:11,580
There we go

1284
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:26,420
Where's it? Where's it? Where's it? Oh shit, it's right there

1285
02:31:33,820 --> 02:31:35,820
Oh

1286
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:38,100
Run

1287
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:51,420
Mace watering howls

1288
02:32:04,060 --> 02:32:08,340
The cherry blossom bloom fully

1289
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:17,940
Thank you

1290
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:25,900
Didn't even have to listen to it

1291
02:32:31,420 --> 02:32:33,420
Obtained odd engraving

1292
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:36,420
I

1293
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:41,980
Can talk to you once mr. Smith

1294
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:45,060
I saw information. Yes

1295
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:47,940
They important ah

1296
02:32:48,780 --> 02:32:50,780
Flower must bloom

1297
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:53,500
Think of a way to make it happen

1298
02:32:55,340 --> 02:32:57,340
Shoot the mask to hear more

1299
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:03,140
But the mask lost for thick blood

1300
02:33:04,820 --> 02:33:07,660
I did it at once. I don't want to do it again

1301
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:30,580
I want I want a room soon

1302
02:33:31,100 --> 02:33:33,100
Yes

1303
02:33:35,580 --> 02:33:40,420
Shit hi, why are you sitting like that?

1304
02:33:44,620 --> 02:33:46,620
Take my blood

1305
02:33:46,620 --> 02:33:48,620
I

1306
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:59,740
Don't make me say it again. She's you still are an ugly fella

1307
02:34:05,300 --> 02:34:12,500
Kevin Smith, let's awaken everyone. Yeah, I need

1308
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:16,580
Where should I put it in

1309
02:34:19,340 --> 02:34:21,340
Where should I put it in some pie

1310
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:31,100
I think waiver power everything in power

1311
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:37,980
And to call

1312
02:34:38,980 --> 02:34:44,820
You can't just ask that mercy. Why not the perfectly innocent question

1313
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:57,020
Fatality is still good though

1314
02:34:57,660 --> 02:35:06,900
And I want to save point

1315
02:35:10,380 --> 02:35:12,380
Downstairs

1316
02:35:14,860 --> 02:35:22,540
Wait, there was another room right hold on was there another room no, there was just Harman's room hold on sorry

1317
02:35:27,020 --> 02:35:29,020
I

1318
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:59,540
I

1319
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:06,740
Power lunch

1320
02:36:08,060 --> 02:36:14,860
The owner Fukushima is mixed up in all sorts of things even the International Ethics Committee is getting involved

1321
02:36:17,860 --> 02:36:19,860
Chief you watch yourself

1322
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:28,260
The ethics agents or hyenas are a motley crew of rejects, but the assassins trained in the core

1323
02:36:28,820 --> 02:36:34,900
Now those guys are what about after the Yakumo party cabinet policy or Yakumo for short

1324
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:40,340
It's just a bunch of paper, but it can change the world you end party my friend

1325
02:36:42,660 --> 02:36:44,660
I'm getting tired Senpai

1326
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:48,460
Oh, I'm not doing so hot though

1327
02:37:01,860 --> 02:37:03,660
I don't remember which face bitch

1328
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:11,780
Come on open your head

1329
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:17,500
Senpai it turned into a square

1330
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:41,500
There's nothing here

1331
02:37:44,660 --> 02:37:46,660
Oh

1332
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:58,980
Did he just clean his shoe with his gun

1333
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:12,140
Wait, I'm lost wait Senpai I'm lost I didn't go this way did I?

1334
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:16,660
I

1335
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:26,540
Don't think I've been this way yet

1336
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:30,780
Or

1337
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:33,860
Yeah

1338
02:38:34,540 --> 02:38:36,540
Block deactivated

1339
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:38,540
I

1340
02:38:41,460 --> 02:38:43,460
Fine I want a room

1341
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:50,140
I mean yes

1342
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:08,980
Oh

1343
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:14,580
Me to carry your pigeon

1344
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:26,260
Continuing my report Kevin Smith never fails to amaze you won't believe this but it's the straight-up truth

1345
02:39:26,260 --> 02:39:28,900
The sucker is a real-life invisible man. Oh

1346
02:39:29,820 --> 02:39:32,300
Plenty I teach an interesting name

1347
02:39:33,740 --> 02:39:35,740
Why must they taught me like that?

1348
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:43,420
At first even I didn't believe it. This has got to be a hoax, right? Oh shit the guys for real and

1349
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:47,020
Then con Smith what a pain in the ass punk?

1350
02:39:47,020 --> 02:39:53,140
I can never catch him it blows my socks off nine times. He speeds off. He disappears

1351
02:39:53,580 --> 02:39:59,420
That's right. This appears Olympic records mean nothing with him running around

1352
02:40:00,660 --> 02:40:02,660
Coyote Smith has a thing a

1353
02:40:03,220 --> 02:40:09,880
Thing for being a crook, but he's not like other thugs. He's fit. He jumps like an animal incredible

1354
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:13,620
Athleticism not to mention he can pick any padlock

1355
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:20,300
Must pick this up as a method of survival in a rough neighborhood and then there's Garcia and Smith

1356
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:24,720
I really haven't seen much seeing him much so everything. I know is based on conjecture

1357
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:28,900
You and rumor has it he can spot the heavens mile a mile away

1358
02:40:29,380 --> 02:40:35,580
This character is no joke going up against monsters like that. My investigation continues Johnny Gagman

1359
02:40:53,300 --> 02:40:58,140
Is this the way it was Zaru you spoke to me again

1360
02:40:59,780 --> 02:41:01,940
Master, this is bad

1361
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:05,140
It's just can't be good at all

1362
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:07,900
Be sure about that mask

1363
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:14,860
Master you must have doubts or I would think I'm wearing a bit. That's for sure

1364
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:21,420
Whenever you get in tight spot you break out your silly wrestling moves. I can't you bury the past

1365
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:29,240
By the way, your special size suplex move should be banned the name of Harmon

1366
02:41:38,980 --> 02:41:40,980
Lumber essential for training

1367
02:41:42,420 --> 02:41:47,000
All right, you know what this means mask this Smith

1368
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:53,420
Oh

1369
02:42:01,540 --> 02:42:03,540
He just suplexed that

1370
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:11,060
What's in your right hand Chico

1371
02:42:11,860 --> 02:42:15,220
Please don't this is just a put your arms down

1372
02:42:15,220 --> 02:42:22,980
Oh, no, no, it's not like that this gun is it don't move amigo. Don't move amigo shoot stay still

1373
02:42:45,220 --> 02:42:48,060
Is a kitchen cleaning up that you can lick the floor

1374
02:42:48,700 --> 02:42:53,980
Anyway, it's the least that I can do for them the others the chef the waiters

1375
02:42:54,220 --> 02:43:01,580
Where are they those guys with the strange smiles? You saw them. It's dangerous. Okay. Get out of here. I

1376
02:43:12,820 --> 02:43:14,820
Have a feeling you're up to no good

1377
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:17,220
I

1378
02:43:38,700 --> 02:43:40,700
Point say point say point say point

1379
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:57,220
Why is she so mean to me why is she so mean to me

1380
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:17,580

02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:40,020
Where's the same point I don't remember which way am I facing

1382
02:44:45,220 --> 02:44:47,220
I

1383
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:53,260
Where am I

1384
02:44:55,180 --> 02:45:00,780
I'm there there's not a safe point until up there

1385
02:45:15,220 --> 02:45:17,220

Not shots Jesus fucking Christ

It's a Feng shui man

1391
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:06,620
I

1392
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:20,840
Mr. Smith I saw information. Yes, look closely at that sign

1393
02:46:23,820 --> 02:46:30,140
Big hit right in front of you car no directions in the mythical beast can't be a part no

1394
02:46:30,940 --> 02:46:32,940
I

1395
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:35,540
Must come together

1396
02:46:36,740 --> 02:46:38,740
To the mask we hear more

1397
02:46:42,180 --> 02:46:44,180
But the mask lust for thick blood

1398
02:46:48,820 --> 02:46:50,820
Okay, so what

1399
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:53,180

1456
02:52:25,820 --> 02:52:33,940
Did the shooting I finished the last part that was pretty cool actually the beginning which felt like the tutorial

1457
02:52:35,140 --> 02:52:37,140

1458
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:40,500

What's what's kind of fun kind of

1460
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:48,580
But now they wrap things up so much. I'm just like

Can't shoot shooting is hard. Thank goodness. I took my pills

1464
02:53:09,860 --> 02:53:14,420
Well, please don't ever say that sentence unironically again, what did I say? I

1465
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:20,300
Took my nausea pills

1466
02:53:25,220 --> 02:53:27,220

1467
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:32,980

02:54:08,260 --> 02:54:10,660
We're shoot we're shoot Maxon

1472
02:54:10,660 --> 02:54:12,660
I

1473
02:54:21,860 --> 02:54:23,860
Don't know these these darn

1474
02:54:24,380 --> 02:54:30,660
New words they come out so fast now. I think it's cuz of tiktok. I think it's cuz of tiktok

1475
02:54:32,300 --> 02:54:34,660

1482
02:55:41,100 --> 02:55:48,060
But now I'm tired and I think it's a result of my nausea pills wearing off a bit I

1483
02:55:57,380 --> 02:55:59,380
Think it's cuz of the nausea pills

1484
02:56:03,940 --> 02:56:07,340
But yeah, let's go to just chatting

1485

1511
02:58:33,580 --> 02:58:40,100
I'm so new to like reading Supas and having membas. I'm just like what what is the etiquette?

1512
02:58:40,380 --> 02:58:47,020
What is the etiquette of like doing this I know that like I

1513
02:58:51,620 --> 02:58:53,620
Know that like a lot of people

1514
02:58:59,020 --> 02:59:02,860
A lot of people say things for the end of stream, but I'm just like

1515
02:59:03,540 --> 02:59:05,100
That's that's okay, right?

1516
02:59:05,100 --> 02:59:09,420
That's okay to like kind of do some of them at the end of stream and some of them like in the middle, right?

1517
02:59:09,420 --> 02:59:11,420
I'm not really sure

1518
02:59:13,940 --> 02:59:15,940
And I really share

1519
02:59:17,860 --> 02:59:19,860
It's your call really

1520
02:59:21,860 --> 02:59:24,740
That's good to do either way. It's all about the mullet

1521
02:59:27,140 --> 02:59:33,380
And it depends on the screen okay, cuz I'm just like oh, I don't really know

1522
02:59:40,340 --> 02:59:42,340
I

1523
02:59:45,340 --> 02:59:47,980
Don't really know the etiquette, but whoa, whoa, we'll see

1524
02:59:48,700 --> 02:59:53,100
Yeah, we'll see we'll see I'll I'll I'll get it some pie. I'll get it some pie

1525
02:59:59,900 --> 03:00:04,820
I'll get it some pie. I'm so new to this. I didn't stream on on YouTube

1526
03:00:05,820 --> 03:00:11,620
I didn't stream on YouTube when I was streaming so this is this is all kind of new I did do some

1527
03:00:13,020 --> 03:00:15,020
YouTube streams

1528
03:00:15,140 --> 03:00:17,140
but

1529
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:19,460
They didn't have rays or anything

1530
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:22,820
They didn't have any of the stuff

1531
03:00:27,980 --> 03:00:31,700
I wonder how reading soup buzz and effects engagement I have no idea

1532
03:00:32,700 --> 03:00:35,380
The only time I kind of know about soup buzz is

1533
03:00:36,620 --> 03:00:38,980
is with like hollow live and

1534
03:00:40,860 --> 03:00:46,540
I don't know. I feel like that's kind of we don't play by that rule because

1535
03:00:47,540 --> 03:00:50,020
Obviously, it's not as big of a

1536
03:00:52,580 --> 03:00:54,580
Of a of a crowd

1537
03:00:57,860 --> 03:00:59,860
Different standards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1538
03:01:01,700 --> 03:01:03,700
I

1539
03:01:08,820 --> 03:01:10,820
Something like that, you know like

1540
03:01:12,900 --> 03:01:17,300
I'm just a small fish I'm just a small fish

1541
03:01:24,860 --> 03:01:29,660
I'm just a small fish in the sea of beautiful v2 birds

1542
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:32,660
I'm just a small fish with a

1543
03:01:34,300 --> 03:01:36,300
strange laugh a

1544
03:01:37,820 --> 03:01:43,580
Squawky voice and and a perchance for for murder

1545
03:01:43,580 --> 03:01:45,580
I

1546
03:01:58,700 --> 03:02:02,900
Perchance incline. Yeah

1547
03:02:08,820 --> 03:02:12,620
I'll say you'll notice that I'll say sayings very wrong

1548
03:02:14,580 --> 03:02:16,580
You

1549
03:02:20,860 --> 03:02:23,820
Your sub count ain't gonna be small fish for

1550
03:02:24,420 --> 03:02:30,700
Long with how fast it's expanding you won't be you won't just be a big yo won't just be a big fish soon soon

1551
03:02:30,700 --> 03:02:32,220
You'll be jaws

1552
03:02:32,220 --> 03:02:36,940
Am I gonna get killed and are pooned right through right through the mouth?

1553
03:02:37,460 --> 03:02:39,460
Oh

1554
03:02:41,140 --> 03:02:43,620
Perchance just reminded me of the essay. That's what I'm referencing

1555
03:02:45,420 --> 03:02:51,340
I wasn't an explosion. I can't remember. Oh, man. It was an explosion, right? Wait. No spoilers

1556
03:02:52,100 --> 03:02:54,100

Wait, how long?

1558
03:03:00,180 --> 03:03:02,180

03:03:03,140 --> 03:03:09,160
You mean a second since 1975

1560
03:03:21,140 --> 03:03:26,540
Some folks will read soup was but not the name to avoid parasocial and or compare

1561
03:03:27,260 --> 03:03:32,380

1577
03:05:15,980 --> 03:05:24,940
They don't want their names read they can always donate anonymously. Oh, that's an idea too. I

What would you do if you caught a Senpai on the phone well check what's on the phone duh

1607
03:09:01,060 --> 03:09:03,060
Check what's on the phone duh

1608
03:09:07,260 --> 03:09:13,940
Are you playing games or are you cheating?

1609
03:09:24,860 --> 03:09:26,860
I just wanted to repeat the okay

03:09:28,460 --> 03:09:35,300

Go minna sigh

1612
03:09:53,460 --> 03:09:57,740
I'm E.P. tired emotional

1613
03:10:07,140 --> 03:10:15,380
That's my schedule, okay. Well tomorrow I have my day off

1614
03:10:18,700 --> 03:10:20,780
So I'm gonna hang out with friends and stuff

1615
03:10:22,580 --> 03:10:27,460
Wednesday is death mark again. Well, I know death mark is not a very popular game

1616
03:10:27,980 --> 03:10:34,140
But I want to relax and I think that would be really really great if we we all relax

1617
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:37,140
Relax while I read

1618
03:10:39,140 --> 03:10:46,860
Thursday is the untitled goose game collab with straw knee so we're going to have a lot of fun with that

1619
03:10:49,140 --> 03:10:50,820
And

1620
03:10:50,820 --> 03:10:57,460
Followed by that is another day off and then the uno collab which by the way my time is not correct

1621
03:10:57,460 --> 03:11:01,900
So please check the other girls's calendars to see if it's correct

1622
03:11:05,140 --> 03:11:08,580
Because yeah, it's not correct on my on my schedule

1623
03:11:11,020 --> 03:11:12,420
And

1624
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:17,580
Then I have another day off. So I have three days off this week

1625
03:11:18,220 --> 03:11:22,220
Hopefully I can recover my arms and my legs and stuff. I

1626
03:11:23,340 --> 03:11:28,460
Was a game called death mark relaxing. It's not but it is a visual novel

1627
03:11:28,980 --> 03:11:33,380
So it's not like it's not it can be played one-handed

1628
03:11:34,540 --> 03:11:39,260
It can be played one-handed and so I don't put strain on like this this this hand

1629
03:11:49,460 --> 03:11:51,460
So yeah, I'm trying to

1630
03:11:53,660 --> 03:11:59,820
To to rest this arm hopefully it was it won't

1631
03:11:59,820 --> 03:12:01,820
Oh

1632
03:12:02,700 --> 03:12:04,700
It won't

1633
03:12:05,820 --> 03:12:08,620
It is ill it is like a bit time though

1634
03:12:08,620 --> 03:12:15,220
So the visual novel has like quick time events, but like I think they're kind of okay quick time events. So it's not

1635
03:12:16,380 --> 03:12:18,060
too

1636
03:12:18,060 --> 03:12:21,380
Not too stressful. Yeah

1637
03:12:23,260 --> 03:12:28,340
She's rest filled Sigma. I don't know what that means. What does Sigma mean?

1638
03:12:30,260 --> 03:12:32,260
I

1639
03:12:33,780 --> 03:12:35,780
Yeah, quick time events are

1640
03:12:35,940 --> 03:12:39,140
Yeah, that one there's some quick time events. I think

1641
03:12:40,060 --> 03:12:47,020
There's a little bit at stake. So we'll see we'll see and I was not not too not too fun, but it's uh

1642
03:12:49,940 --> 03:12:51,940
It's

1643
03:12:52,260 --> 03:12:54,260
Oh

1644
03:12:55,820 --> 03:12:59,980
What's the word it's it's it's a game where we can relax and I

1645
03:13:04,780 --> 03:13:08,020
Yeah, so that's for the schedule this week

1646
03:13:13,020 --> 03:13:19,060
I'm hoping I'm gonna figure out something so I'm hoping to open up membership streams

1647
03:13:20,060 --> 03:13:21,660
Uh soon

1648
03:13:21,660 --> 03:13:27,660
I don't really know what people do for them for membership streams, but I guess like you just do whatever, right?

1649
03:13:28,060 --> 03:13:30,580
So I want to try to do a membership stream

1650
03:13:32,860 --> 03:13:36,300
Soon so I don't know when but yeah, I

1651
03:13:36,940 --> 03:13:39,940
Want to I want to I don't know if I'm gonna do it this week

1652
03:13:39,940 --> 03:13:43,380
Maybe next week, but I want to try to do at least once a week

1653
03:13:45,220 --> 03:13:47,380
At least once a week for for members

1654
03:13:48,140 --> 03:13:50,140
Remember

1655
03:13:50,460 --> 03:13:52,460
So that

1656
03:13:53,740 --> 03:13:56,220
So that we can have some fun together

1657
03:14:01,380 --> 03:14:07,220
So, yeah, I'm so so tired Senpai, I'm so sorry. I know it's

1658
03:14:10,100 --> 03:14:12,460
Now I started the stream kind of rough and

1659
03:14:14,060 --> 03:14:16,060
