390000	404940	Hi everyone. Sorry I'm a bit late. Bad news. I'm feeling a little under the weather by
404940	413360	under the weather. I mean, not sad, but like, you know, not well. So if I sound a bit funny,
413360	435760	I apologize for that. That's just me. That's just me, but it's because I do have emergency
435760	443840	stuff in here. And I will, and then I do have a BRB screen in case I need to like, you know,
443840	459040	yeah. So there we go. So forgive me, it really just happened not too long ago. I was coughing
459040	468560	up. I felt like I was coughing up the lung. So if if I if suddenly I would I start coughing in a
468560	482240	nice sound weird. That's why. Did you eat some bad color fish? No. No, I wouldn't eat. No, maybe.
483120	493360	Next question. Anyways, probably nerves. Yeah, probably nerves. But welcome everyone to my two
493360	504400	point. Oh, the debut debut debut. Sorry. debutant. We'll get right to business. I like I like getting
504400	510080	my charts out of the way. So we'll start with tags first. No, general take is not indulge. A general
510080	515280	take is a tag that I want for you guys. If you guys want to be like, Oh my gosh, I love Mercy so
515280	524560	much as you should. Oh my God, I love Mercy so much. I want I want her to see my my love letter
524560	532080	to her that I posted on Twitter. I need something like that. So I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking
532080	546960	I'm thinking just mercy mode east. Which one of these would a fan song go under? I believe that'll
546960	557360	be art. I know it's like, I said art is like modellus list. But like, music is art. Anything is art.
558320	560480	Hear me out. Okay, that was pretty good.
562320	568640	Scissor mercy, scissor me, mama mercy. I'm not the mama here. I'm not the mama here. We've
568640	575600	got three mothers. We've got three mothers, which is, of course, mom, a mommy being one mother,
576400	584240	second mother being, um, Azura, who has lovingly given us a raid. Thank you so much.
584800	595760	And as well as she be she be the toilet is, uh, is our third mother.

632400	644240	They are so cute. Have mercy. Okay. I love the, I love these tags, except for one thing.
644240	650800	One thing my lovely senpai, my senpais is that, um, we gotta make them sort of unique
650800	656800	so that, you know, some rando, I don't either one take over some Randall's tag, although I can.
657840	664800	I too, I don't, uh, it doesn't get mixed in with like someone's, someone's book club, you know?
667120	671760	Shear me out is a good one. Yeah. You know what? Shear me out is a good one. Yeah. You know what?
671760	676240	Yeah. Heck yeah. Let's do that. You know, here for my general tag is
677040	681040	Shear me out. Wow. So good.
690560	696400	Modesty cuts. Modesty cuts. Shear me out. Yeah. That's pretty good, right? So if you write me
696400	702560	love letters, it's a general tag. Just be like, Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Mercy. Shear me out. Okay.
706560	717520	So it's good. Yeah. Uh, live. Personally, I don't know if I like
718560	727040	mm online because mm online was just like Mercy Mode East online. Mercy time.
729360	735360	Mercy time for live. That's a good one. I'm not as creative as my lovely senpais. My senpais are
735360	742320	also amazingly creative. Sounds like MMO. Yeah. That's my issue. That's my issue is that it sounds
742320	755760	like MMO and I was like, Oh, you're right. Time for mercy. Show mercy. That sounds like
755760	762400	I'm literally taking over a tag that of someone, of someone at their like little book club.
762480	765200	That's gotta do. No mercy. Mercy. No mercy.
769600	777040	Stock o'clock. Mercy lane. Snippity clippy. No. Snippity. Snippy clippy for clips. That
777040	780960	sounds good too. Big for mercy. No mercy. Sheer time. Mode East live.

798560	811040	How about this guys? Okay. Stream for mercy. Huh? Huh? Anybody?
812000	825040	Stream for mercy. Do you like four as the number four or like the word four?
828240	832960	Like you can do like a stream, stream, stream, stream,
833920	844640	for mercy versus stream, stream, for mercy. What do you guys think? Four for sure? Okay.
846080	851120	We're all such a team. We're such a team. And this is why I keep you guys in my basement.

896000	903680	Wait. I don't know the difference between a dehumidifier and a humidifier. The reason why
903680	910480	I'm just like a humidifier has like, it causes moding. And I don't want that. I want you to live
910480	916560	in the best situation ever, Senpai. That's why I put in like those shiny glow in the dark
916560	919840	stickers of stars. So it looks like you're laying underneath the stars in the cage.

2345660	2352660	You said you like SMT4 in debut, so how do you feel about SMT5 apocalypse play through play through when it comes out
2353500	2358180	Okay, so I won't answer this truthfully. I have SMT5 and
2358660	2363860	The reason why 5 is not my favorite and I wouldn't play apocalypse is because
2364980	2366980	beacons
2367260	2374220	When I played, you know, the little exploration area and the 3d exploration area. I got a really bad motion sickness
2375700	2376700	I
2376700	2378700	Really bad
2378700	2380700	Motion sickness. I was just
2386700	2391420	I was uh, uh, I don't know why 4 was great probably because it's on a
2392700	2400540	And a smaller screen a smaller screen on the DS. So I was I was probably okay with it, but when I
2400540	2402540	I
2403180	2405740	Play played 5 I was like
2409900	2417020	But I bought I bought for you for you guys. So I have a theory I want to test with my senpai
2417420	2421740	So with my senpai's I want to test the theory, which is I'm going to slowly build
2422780	2424780	my
2424780	2426780	My uh tolerance
2427340	2433420	To 3d 3d motion and 3 games and I'm gonna see if I can build it up
2434380	2436540	through years
2436540	2438940	So I know a lot of a lot of people
2439580	2442380	Grew up with games. I did not grow up with games
2443260	2446460	So I figured maybe I can play games like
2447420	2449420	well
2450300	2452300	Uh gold and I
2452940	2454940	Like gold and I
2455740	2457740	And then move on through years
2458540	2461740	Through the years to play more modern games. Does that make sense?
2462220	2466060	I feel like I I feel like that's what I should do
2469420	2472540	Get motion sickness glasses. Guess what I do have those dorky
2473100	2475500	Motion sickness glasses. I wonder if I still have
2475820	2480460	If I have I make them into an ass that long long ago
2488220	2490220	Hold on
2490220	2492220	I have these dorky ass glasses
2493980	2496540	That look like this so they have like
2497260	2500540	Uh little liquid the the thing is that it's supposed to
2501260	2503260	So
2504860	2512380	Help with uh motion sickness. Um because of the liquid will help stabilize blah blah blah something signs you can look it up
2518700	2520700	Anyways, uh
2521020	2524940	I bought I went out and actually bought these glasses
2525900	2527900	Real not fake
2528860	2532620	I bought these glasses and guess what the liquid in them evaporated
2541340	2544960	And evaporated and I went now they just look like dorky glasses
2545120	2547120	Oh
2555200	2556560	It's okay
2556560	2559920	What I would rip off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was but I got it on sale
2560000	2563760	I got it on sale for like three dollars three three dollary dues
2565040	2567040	So it was fine
2568640	2571840	So it was fine. So that's why I have like super bad motion sickness
2572400	2577280	Um, do you guys want to hear a story about how I discovered I have motion sickness?
2582160	2584160	So
2587920	2589920	I've done this story many times already
2591360	2593360	um
2594240	2599120	To classify what sort of sickness motion sickness I have it's specifically screen sickness
2600080	2602080	Yeah, so
2604320	2607760	So screen sickness I was in class
2608080	2611920	Okay, I sit in the front row of class because I'm a try hard student
2612720	2614720	honors all that
2615200	2616720	Okay
2616720	2620160	I I work hard and school in school
2620720	2622720	So
2627040	2629520	Shut up. Yeah, I'm a good ko hi. I'm a good ko hi
2630560	2636080	I'm a good ko hi. I paid off my I paid off student loans and stuff with with basically
2636800	2638800	grants and scholarships
2643200	2648320	Anyways, so a science eating. No, I wanted to sit in the front because I one I can't see
2649040	2652320	I have is it near-sightedness where you can't really see far away
2655200	2657200	Anyways
2659680	2663920	I I forgot I forgot so yeah near-sightedness probably, um
2667680	2673760	I sat in the front and then we watched I was a screening so I took a lot of
2674720	2683280	Cinematography classes and and film studies classes because I really like I really like films. I really like film. It's really fun. Um
2687920	2689920	So
2689920	2694400	I sat in the front and then we were watching 2001 a space Odyssey. You're gonna hear about the story a lot
2695040	2698720	2001 a space Odyssey is a story that oh that always comes up
2699440	2702800	And to that space Odyssey, you know the stargate sequence
2704400	2706640	so, you know the stargate sequence where um
2707280	2712160	What's his face is going through time and then it's going really fast and you he's just going whoa
2713760	2719120	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that that part I was watching that part intensely and then
2719920	2721920	I was like, oh, I'm starting to cough
2724720	2726720	And then I threw up in front of everyone
2727440	2729440	And
2733840	2738880	That's how I discovered I had screams slash most in most sickness
2744720	2750640	And then I had to excuse myself bathroom was there come back in clean it clean it all up
2751520	2753520	Ah
2755120	2757120	Life is uh
2758080	2760080	Life gets you hard
2761360	2764160	So if anyone remembers that day, uh, no, you don't
2770320	2775840	Yeah, don't know you don't it was on a big screen. So it was a big projector as well. So it was
2776800	2782160	Yeah, it was embarrassing. I didn't say that as like my cringe moment in life because I didn't think it was that cringe
2782160	2784160	I thought it was just funny
2784560	2788160	Cringe though. I've got so much cringe in my life. I had to pick something
2800000	2805040	Are you okay at the movies? Yeah, I'm okay most movies most movies are fine
2806800	2808800	Most if something kind of like, you know
2810560	2812560	If something, um
2813360	2816720	Oh, you threw up on the projector. Now I threw up all over like the desk and floor
2819680	2824560	Um, I go for the non 3d movies
2825360	2829280	So I don't I I picked the standard standard edition one
2829840	2832480	So I don't really get the glasses in or anything
2833200	2835920	So like projectile plummeting
2837120	2839120	Shut up shut up senpai
2841520	2843520	Sort of yes
2846000	2848720	Is there a certain genre you avoid like action or horror
2849360	2854240	At the movie for that reason, uh, there's a reason why I don't really watch like bay movies, you know
2855120	2857120	Hmm
2858800	2864160	But usually I tend to watch standard standard should be fine. And if I feel like I'm gonna like
2866080	2871760	I uh, I close my eyes. I don't see it. I close my eyes
2878640	2881120	So date night on john wick movie is not a great idea
2881200	2887200	Um, a john wick movie will probably be on like a standard tv size. So like just maybe like at home
2887920	2892240	At home tv. Yeah, are you guys saying you want to go on a date with me? Is that what you're saying?
2897680	2899680	So, um, I do not see it
2902320	2906400	That's why I don't really feel like I would play smt
2907040	2912640	Five apocalypse unless I played smt five first but smt five caused me to like
2913840	2919840	But smt four apocalypse was like really fun. I got stuck on one part though. There was an item that
2920560	2925200	Was an item there's a place that I tried to find but I couldn't find so I couldn't proceed with the game
2926320	2927360	for uh
2927360	2935040	smt four apocalypse. It was really fun though. I really liked uh playing it. Uh, I have fond memories of of um
2936000	2938000	of smt
2938000	2941520	smt force in particular. It's not very punishing. I don't think
2942560	2945920	And I I was able to finish it. So that's
2947520	2949520	That's pretty good
2952000	2955760	But mercy, what if you tried 2001 a space odyssey on acid?
2957680	2961120	I got offered that choice and I said
2962480	2964480	Thanks, but no thanks
2965760	2972080	How about roller coasters? I don't feel that great on roller coasters either. So I tried to avoid them
2972720	2975360	Some of them I do okay on which is weird
2976480	2977520	but
2977520	2980400	Uh, generally I feel like my motion sickness has been
2981040	2985840	mostly to do with the screen stuff anything with the screen. So if I see like, oh
2987200	2990640	First person stuff. Oh my gosh, like a game that I feel
2991440	2993440	Really makes me throw yuppie
2994400	2999280	Yeah, what's that free game more frame? Yeah, war frame makes me really throw yuppie
3009360	3017440	So that's one thing that I feel like knock turn I feel like was a little punishing for smt. So I didn't really like it
3018160	3020160	Yeah
3020480	3022480	Yeah, and then I played smt one
3023040	3027280	The ios because it was released on the ios and the touch buttons were really hard. So I didn't really
3027920	3033680	Go through it. Have you tried vr funny enough? I don't know why but I have less motion sickness in vr
3033680	3035680	But I just can't afford a headset
3036160	3038480	I I just don't have a headset. So I've been borrowing
3038800	3040800	Oh
3046240	3050080	Would you play vengeance smt five or no, mm same thing
3052640	3055440	They are cheaper now they are but I'm still
3058720	3065040	I'm so poor. I live with my parents. So you guys are stuck with me in my basement with my parents
3069440	3071440	You're welcome
3078960	3086560	Okay, so next question out of all the vtuber corporations out there, why did you choose to apply to this one?
3090720	3092720	Oh
3099440	3105920	This is a little bit of a harder question, but I guess the way I can sum it up is that scrawny gave me a chance
3107440	3109680	Um, I wasn't very
3111120	3113120	picky
3113120	3114800	so to say
3114800	3116800	with uh applying to places
3118560	3120560	So
3121680	3123920	I tend to I got a
3124880	3126640	I tend to choose
3126640	3129440	Places that I feel like I would probably thrive in
3130640	3132640	And so I would apply to there
3132880	3134880	but I'm not that
3135760	3136880	Picky
3136880	3139840	Picky so to say but at the same time when scrawny
3140640	3145040	When scrawny did the announcement. I was like, okay, I'm kind of interested in this company
3145280	3147280	I'm kind of interested in this company
3147440	3152880	Let's see and I decided to watch her stream talking about it
3153440	3155440	So
3158720	3161840	When I saw her stream talking about I felt very moved
3162880	3164560	I felt very moved like honestly
3164560	3170640	I felt like I was like, you know, you ever just feel like your heart throb a little bit when you see someone
3170640	3178080	Or you hear some some speech or see a wonderful movie. I felt that I felt that when I heard scrawny talk about the company
3178480	3180480	And
3181520	3183520	I was
3184320	3191600	Really, I was really moved by her goals and what she wanted and I actually truly believed in her dreams
3194800	3196800	So
3196880	3198880	I truly believe in her dreams. So
3200400	3202000	You know, I
3202000	3204000	am probably
3204960	3210000	I'm probably the least out of everyone here. I'm the least
3211760	3213440	familiar
3213440	3215440	with
3215440	3217440	asmr and
3219280	3224560	Asmr and kind of like, you know, the alternative stuff, right?
3228160	3230160	So
3231280	3233200	So, um
3233280	3235280	I'm still learning
3235760	3237760	The caveat when they said that
3238400	3239920	Uh
3239920	3246480	That you needed 18 plus experience. I do have that. I played a lot of of of of alternate games
3250000	3256320	So it's all new to you. Mm-hmm. Well asmr and stuff streaming and v tubing not so much
3258560	3260400	So I played uh
3260400	3264240	Errol gay basically, I'll just say it outright. I played Errol gay on stream
3266000	3268000	And that was enough that was enough
3276800	3278800	So I have to play, um
3280320	3285040	So I'm basically learning as I go so a lot of times I
3287040	3289040	Excuse me
3290640	3292640	Hmm
3312240	3315120	Okay, I um, I played
3316080	3318080	18 plus games
3318160	3321840	Uh, so I'm not familiar with asmr or anything. I
3323680	3329520	So when I signed on I was I would bother scrawny a lot like scrawny scrawny
3330320	3331840	What does this mean?
3331840	3333840	What is this?
3334880	3339600	So I would say something like, um, let's see one of my recordings. I was like
3340560	3343600	Really confused by something so
3344480	3350960	I guess I can tell you what it is. It's not it's not too bad. So I basically asked scrawny scrawny
3352400	3354400	What's the countdown?
3365280	3368480	And I would go scrawny
3369600	3371600	Do I have to say the numbers?
3373520	3376320	And scrawny goes, yes, yes, please say the numbers
3379440	3382560	Okay, I come back maybe another time going
3384560	3387760	I say brown noise, what does that mean?
3394240	3396880	Or I go scrawny
3397840	3400720	Why these globe things?
3408480	3411360	So I'm very I'm very ignorant
3413600	3415600	Ignorant naive
3419760	3421760	Dang did you almost talk a looty there? Yeah
3421920	3432320	So I would be like what are these? What are these? What does this mean? And I would just go like
3434320	3436320	I would
3438400	3443840	So I would bother scrawny a lot with them and she would be like it means this it means this
3443840	3446560	She's been very nice to me. I feel like there's time for should be like
3447440	3449440	Listen mercy. You probably just need to google it
3451840	3453840	I
3457920	3459920	I'm learning very slowly
3464880	3468640	But yeah, everyone's been super nice to me I've been
3470160	3473040	Kind of experimenting with certain things
3474000	3476000	um asmr is very new to me
3476560	3478560	so is kind of like
3479520	3488560	You know alternative content as well, so it's very new so please take care of me senpai. I'm literally giving you my virginity
3495920	3500080	Asmr virginity I should probably probably say that
3500160	3512640	So be nice, okay be nice, uh, there is an audio that I'm a little worried about that people might not
3513280	3518160	Like so just know that I'm studying I get feedback all the time
3519040	3521200	I get feedback from all the time and then
3523280	3525120	Um
3525120	3527120	And I'm improving all the time
3528000	3530000	At least I think I am
3530400	3532400	Okay
3536400	3539360	So I hope you guys are super understanding with that
3539840	3541840	Thanks
3544160	3549600	So I literally study a whole lot so since I'm so new to this I study a whole lot
3550400	3552800	I think the reason why I
3553600	3554880	am okay
3554880	3559280	At my which I'm really surprised people have complimented a lot on my first audio
3560160	3562160	I think the reason why I did
3562720	3565680	I'm doing okay is because I do have an acting background
3568960	3571280	I I have a very extensive acting background
3578880	3583520	All right, so let's move on I'm getting embarrassed now
3584320	3586320	Oh
3587920	3589920	Well all kind of acting
3592960	3597920	Stage plays movies television stuff like that
3604160	3606160	Things like that
3606960	3620080	So I have a bit of a bit of that I've also did a lot of training back
3620880	3623760	Back and make myself sound so old
3624400	3631680	Uh back when I was doing a lot of acting I took a lot of classes. So I'm pretty I think I'm pretty decently trained
3632160	3634480	But I'm really rusty. I'm really rusty
3637040	3649200	Yeah, I'm I'm super super rusty and uh
3651920	3658400	And so, um, I'm really polishing polishing it up with with this
3663600	3665600	Uh, yeah
3666640	3674480	Okay, what unique quality do you think makes you stand out from the rest of the girls for the sake of not being controversial
3674480	3680080	I'm not sure what they're trying to say. You're sorry senpai. I don't know what you're really trying to say by controversial
3680320	3682320	What unique skills do you think you have?
3683760	3685760	Are you having fun?
3686240	3691360	Um, of course I'm having the the blah blah. I'm having a blast
3692320	3699600	You mean it's all you don't really love us. It was on act. I didn't say that I didn't say that
3702960	3706720	It means I can be whatever you want me to be senpai, that's all
3707360	3709360	So
3720160	3722800	Uh, what unique qualities make you stand out from the rest of the girls
3724000	3728400	Well, I'm a different person first off my laughs are probably what most people
3729040	3732960	notice when they stand out that stands up the most and I have
3734000	3736000	Well a really different voice
3737680	3744080	Can you be somebody not like I like you anything
3748480	3752640	Wait, you're not yet every ends up. What the fuck do you mean put yourself back here right now?
3757680	3763600	Um, I guess I do have a little bit of the acting background so
3764320	3766720	And I think out of everyone
3767680	3769680	I think
3770000	3774560	I'm not quite sure I need I need to confirm this but I think I am
3775280	3777680	The longest streamer or the most
3778960	3780960	Season streamer
3781360	3783360	Out of my gen mates
3790160	3792160	Probably
3794400	3802560	Probably that what unique skills do I have
3806080	3811840	You can always argue that skills aren't unique and that they can be honed etc, but I would say that
3817520	3819520	That
3819760	3822160	I guess I'm truly in this
3824160	3830880	To improve and continually improve. I don't know. That's not really unique to me. You know what?
3832000	3834000	Forget this question
3835040	3843200	Frequent forget this question. I'm good at taking care of my senpais. I'm good at loving my senpais. I'm good at
3845600	3850640	At making sure that they stay obedient and don't break out of the lock
3851600	3854240	There's 10 locks on that by the way on that door
3864160	3866160	So I feel like
3868080	3872480	What makes me unique is being myself I suppose
3872720	3882720	Yes, I am in love with all my senpais, but I think in a way that is in self as unique charm
3886080	3889200	Jokes on you. I'm a locksmith. Not without hands. You're not
3902720	3904720	Oh
3906640	3912160	Dear you really want to do this. Oh, no, what am I going to do?
3914080	3916080	You have no
3933360	3935360	Oh
3947600	3950960	Now be good, okay, don't make don't do any funny ideas
3955600	3958080	Okay, don't do any funny ideas
3958800	3960800	I
3961440	3963440	Really will

3973200	3975200	Like what more do you want for me?
3977920	3979920	Okay
3980320	3982320	I
3986560	3993840	What do you want this this is the dream you're living with me. We're going to get married. We're gonna have three kids
3994880	3996880	Like what what more do you want?
4000960	4002960	Okay
4003680	4011440	So be good or I'll be very oh, you know, I'll be a little upset, you know
4017040	4019040	All right
4020000	4024560	Why just three well, I feel like they'll support each other very well
4024720	4026720	Oh
4030800	4032800	It's okay, I'll be the breadwinner
4033760	4035760	Sim
4041840	4043840	So we're all good
4055280	4057680	I'm winking but you guys can't see because I have a
4059840	4061280	Hey next question
4061280	4066640	Do you have any longtime girls as in girls girls? What's on my mind girls?
4068000	4072000	As a member of viola. Yes. I want to be here for a long time
4073520	4077360	So what I want is to do like 3d streams outfits
4078160	4082800	Um, continually, uh produce more content for all of you guys
4083760	4085760	and
4088880	4094880	And continue on on uh being a part of this company and hopefully
4095760	4099360	Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully have a bit of my dreams come true as well
4099600	4102160	And I want strong stream to come true. I think
4102960	4104960	I'm so thankful for straw knee
4105200	4106160	and
4106160	4108560	management and like basically every staff
4109440	4112960	That I get to be here. So I feel very thankful for that
4114240	4117520	And so I want to do my best in order to to give back
4118320	4120320	Their pay back their kindness
4129520	4131120	Have you seen
4131120	4136560	I've seen you wish for the sire fumo. Are you a visual fan of visual novels? Do you have favorite aroge? Yes
4137520	4140400	I love the show novels. Why because I can lay back and just go
4152800	4154800	So
4156400	4159680	So I like uh, so I like aroge. Um
4161120	4162720	The last
4162720	4165600	Aroge I played was gore screaming show and I really liked it
4166560	4170400	I really liked it. I thought it had layers like an onion. It had
4173200	4176960	Layers and I really liked it. Um
4179520	4184480	And another one that I really liked I do like saiyano uta
4185760	4191120	I I played saiyano uta when uh, I probably shouldn't have played saiyano
4196960	4202400	So I probably shouldn't have played that game at a certain age
4203920	4205920	Don't do that kids. Um
4206560	4211600	But I was enthralled by it. I was enthralled by the plot and everything. I loved it so much
4214320	4216480	So the last uh
4219440	4223440	Mercy did saiya do anything wrong? No, it was uh, what's his face the entire time?
4224000	4226000	She simply got corrupted my opinion
4230560	4238080	Hey garashi, I love you garashi too, but that's not at all. I think I like uh, what was the call again?
4242480	4248560	I answered this question already on on my twitter and on my moderals, but I can't remember
4250000	4252000	What was the name of it?
4252960	4259280	Oh, they translated it too much. How'd I know shoujo? How'd I know shoujo? I had fun. I had fun with that as well
4260240	4262080	um
4262080	4264080	Yeah
4269200	4274160	So I really like uh playing visual novels, especially kind of like darker visual novels
4274640	4281280	Uh that take a more grim look. I think another one that I recently played was oh shoot. What was it called?
4282240	4285760	It's a really old one. It's considered like, I believe it's one of the first
4286320	4290880	Eroge's to be like officially translated to a western market. What was it called again?
4292240	4296640	Divided. Yeah, I I recently played divided. You can actually play it for free now
4297440	4299440	It's like uh, I
4299760	4302000	Yeah, it's it's it's you can play it for free now. Mm-hmm
4306240	4309840	So I I really like uh playing a lot of games
4310320	4312880	Uh, especially if they're kind of like relaxing for me
4313280	4319360	Um, what I usually do if I stream visual novel games is I will voice the characters myself
4320080	4323200	Um, if the characters have voices, I try to mimic their voices
4323520	4328240	So I hope that's not too distracting, but that's what I'm gonna do and that's what you're gonna like senpai
4330960	4334080	What dead divided di vi dead
4340720	4348400	Yeah, but yeah, that's what you guys guys are gonna like that's what you're gonna take and I'm not gonna do it any other way if you're like
4348480	4352000	Oh, she's reading over the voices and I wanted to hear the voices. I don't care
4353040	4355040	Play it by yourself
4355280	4357280	Right now you're with me
4359200	4361200	All right
4363120	4365120	Amy said something about not
4365360	4369600	Having spicy accounts yet. Do you have a site in mind for it? Yes. I have a site in mind
4370160	4373680	Uh, I want to do the uh, what was it? Finsley?
4378560	4382880	So I want to do that especially for arrow gay
4385520	4387760	For arrow gay, I really like that and I had a
4389200	4393120	Good stamina for reading reading visual novels and gaming
4393680	4400720	So I think uh, we'll we'll play lots. We'll play lots. Uh, of course, I've asked management about it and I've asked Ronnie about it
4401040	4403040	and of course, it's uh, it's uh
4404160	4406160	We should probably establish
4406160	4407920	um
4407920	4415680	Establish ourselves on uh, youtube and and and as a content creator first before
4416320	4419360	Doing that. So I understand. So please wait patiently. Okay
4424080	4426080	Anything in real life now
4428080	4430080	I'm shy
4430160	4434720	I'm shy. No, really. I'm I'm super shy. Like I might seem outgoing now, but honestly, uh
4435760	4441600	I famously spent like entire week trying to talk to someone and then like I I took the the time to uh
4442240	4444240	Finally talk to a friend and I was like, ah
4444880	4446880	And I took me uh
4446960	4448960	Uh, hi
4449840	4456960	No hand cam, maybe that's the most you will get from me. It's maybe a hand cam
4457840	4458960	Maybe
4458960	4460960	It depends on how I feel
4469040	4470160	So
4470160	4473760	I'm like super shy. I'm like super super shy. No, seriously
4474240	4480480	Uh, I'm super I might seem outgoing. I might seem really ganky, but inside I'm internally screaming all the time
4482960	4484800	No, if you can no
4484800	4486800	Uh, no
4487280	4491520	I don't really know how that would be appealing and I haven't been creative enough to think about that
4491520	4496960	But no, no, I don't think so. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
4497680	4499680	I
4500160	4503280	May seem ganky, but I'm really stanky shut the fuck up ghoul
4505120	4506960	I introverted now
4506960	4510560	See the thing is I might I am extroverted
4511040	4514320	Because I always want to be around you senpai like I always want to be you guys
4515040	4520000	Uh always fill me up with such energy and it makes me feel really happy, but
4522400	4524400	I have introverted hobbies
4525120	4529760	So I don't make a lot of friends that easily with introverts or extroverts
4548480	4551280	Like I remember someone was like, oh
4552240	4556800	Do you want to go to a rave? No, I want to go home and watch the movies and stuff, you know, they're just like
4559120	4562240	Why are you so weird for not waiting to go to a rave and I'm like
4564560	4566560	So I've yeah
4569120	4570960	What movie
4570960	4572960	Probably at the time I wanted to watch uh
4573680	4575680	some kind of anime movie probably
4576800	4578800	Probably gentle cyber or something
4582160	4584160	So
4586320	4592000	Yeah, I would call myself an extrovert because I really do feel energy being around other people
4592720	4594560	um, but I would
4594560	4600400	Say that I appear more of an introvert and I have trouble talking to people because of
4601040	4608160	Like my hobbies are not exactly what standard extroverted people have as as as a hobby
4608560	4613520	What's your blood type? Why do you guys want to know my blood type?
4616800	4622800	So introverted extrovert something like that, I don't know I wouldn't put myself in a label too much because
4623520	4625520	Yeah, it just feels weird
4638480	4642320	I mean, I assume, you know, you know all our blood types, maybe
4643840	4649760	Maybe are you guys gonna do the the japanese blood type quiz on me? Want to see what my personality is?
4652000	4655120	I'll give you a hint about why my blood type is it's very common
4656640	4658640	The end
4659600	4661600	There you go
4669760	4674800	Have you played needy streamer overload? If so, what's your opinion on it? I played needy streamer overload
4676400	4678400	This is probably gonna be a little weird
4681200	4683200	Needy streamer overload is
4684640	4685840	Fun
4685840	4691040	I cannot listen to the soundtrack it hurts my ears. There's some kind of frequency in the game that makes me go
4691360	4693360	Oh, this fucking hurts
4693840	4695840	Out of this fucking hurts
4699360	4701360	Does that make sense
4701920	4704640	There's something in the soundtrack that i'm just like
4705520	4708000	I like literally rip my off my headphones and just go
4711920	4714560	So that's why I don't really
4715840	4722240	I'm not the biggest fan of needy streamer overload. I love its aesthetics. I love love the gameplay. I just
4724160	4726160	It hurts my ears
4731360	4732880	I don't know what frequency it is
4732960	4734320	I don't know what frequency it is
4734320	4739040	It feels like when you are a kid and you could hear them and if you could hear the mosquito
4739600	4743600	Sound or something and then it just means you have that like certain frequency that you can hear
4743680	4747200	It feels like that it hurts it hurts my ears. It physically hurts my ears
4755760	4760800	So that's why uh, I also hope that i'm that insane
4762960	4764960	You're welcome
4766480	4770180	Played on mute. Oh, but if I played on mute, it's boring. It's boring
4774160	4780240	I'm not your senpai because I'm probably younger than you and that would make me your coal hides over shut up
4780720	4785600	You guys are all my all senpais. Senpai's not age. Senpai's not a gender
4787600	4793760	Except for senpai if you're if you if you are under 18, maybe you shouldn't be here
4799840	4801840	This was sent by a 38 year old
4802720	4804720	Senpai
4805040	4807040	Is you and I love you
4807920	4809920	truly sincerely I do
4810480	4812160	I
4812160	4819600	believe senpai is a mentor type person and you guys are also mentoring me through my journey through asmr as well
4820640	4824720	That's why everyone is senpai and I'm coal hide only me
4832800	4834800	So
4835360	4840000	That's why I feel like my senpais are all you guys. I know that your fan names are
4841120	4843520	snippets but snippets but
4844400	4850720	You are all my senpais and you and if you guys don't really like senpai sometimes I'll I'll I'll switch between
4851200	4853200	Senpai and darling
4854240	4856240	Okay
4856320	4861760	Well, you still be coal hide if we all are gets our son second gen
4864800	4867760	If second gen happens and if it does
4868640	4870800	They are the only ones that get to call me senpai
4871760	4873760	understood
4878400	4880400	Duh
4886320	4891040	Mercy is there pet name you like to be called by I like any pet names honestly, uh when
4891840	4896160	Senpai started to call me coal hide. I felt I felt you know, I felt really happy
4897680	4903440	I felt really happy. I feel like that's our pet name. Um, I don't mind any pet name styling honey
4905680	4907680	Baby
4908240	4910240	Anything works
4911680	4913680	Okay
4916240	4918240	Um
4922080	4928400	Um sugar biscuit, I don't know I don't know
4934240	4937600	Snookums I'm I'm all for it. I'm all for it
4937920	4939920	I
4944080	4946080	Therefore
4949200	4951200	Even like sweetheart
4953840	4956880	Pumpkin things like that. I don't mind
4958080	4963680	I don't mind although I do have an affinity an affinity with coal hide right now. Okay
4968560	4971680	Hmm time for a simple question. What is your favorite food? Uh
4974400	4980640	Thing that can eat so if you watched my debut senpai, I have said that I am allergic to eggs and
4981600	4985280	That is a huge freaking problem. Everything contains eggs in it
4987920	4990720	So, uh, I'm not that picky. Um
4991280	4993280	I
4995040	4997040	Don't like porridge because
4997600	5000960	As a child, I was hospitalized a lot
5001680	5004320	And they would always give me porridge every single freaking day
5005280	5007280	Every single freaking meal
5007280	5010480	So it reminds me of when I'm sick. That's all
5011280	5013280	Oh
5017520	5022320	Sorry, I go crazy. I go crazy seeing like other other other girls
5023520	5025600	I go seeing other, uh, corporal girls
5030640	5032640	Hi
5040560	5044560	But okay, sorry, sorry, I got distracted. But yeah, I
5045760	5052240	Can't eat eggs and therefore I'm very allergic to it and anything that contains eggs. I cannot eat it. So that means
5052800	5057200	Uh cakes I have to eat vegan cakes. Um
5060000	5064640	A certain certain ice creams I can't eat ice cream unless it doesn't contain that
5065600	5067600	And
5068880	5071920	All that all that stuff. So I'm super allergic. Uh
5073360	5079040	Another part of my allergy that happens is that, uh, there's a lot of things a lot of things
5079600	5081600	such as vaccines and
5082320	5087040	Medicine that I can't take because of eggs as well. So that's why my immune system is a bit weak
5087120	5089840	It's always been a bit weak since I was a child
5095280	5097280	So that's that's how it is
5099840	5104240	So eggs is a big hate. I don't like the word eggs. I don't like smelling eggs
5104480	5110560	I don't like seeing eggs. So for maybe like, you know, and in an anime like, uh, shugo chara
5111280	5113280	shugo kara
5115760	5117760	Kara for my character. Yeah
5119120	5121120	Those are fine
5121360	5124880	So I have a
5126880	5131760	Yeah, uh, maybe like, yeah, yeah, yeah, like maybe Easter eggs and chocolate eggs fine
5132480	5137200	But like I don't like eggs periods not the smell not being around them
5138480	5141360	If I see the word eggs somewhere. I'm just don't
5145040	5147040	You know done
5152080	5157840	Hi, mercy are you into manga or video novels? Will you read some loon ones? Yes done. I answered that one
5163520	5165520	I'm sorry, I can't see this
5167840	5169840	I can't see this
5170400	5172400	It's too far away from me
5172720	5181040	Can I can I pull this up hold on let me pull this to a different screen
5186720	5188720	Okay, oh
5190080	5192320	Oh, hold on. I need to take off my eyepatch for this
5195360	5200720	Okay, um, what inspired you to be a vtuber? Honestly
5202480	5204480	When keys are not I said
5216720	5224560	Uh, did you help create the avatar? Absolutely not. Can you tell us something behind the scenes? I didn't even get to name
5233200	5235200	Oh
5235840	5242000	I feel so naked without my eyepatch, but I gotta see yeah favorite content creators that aren't vtubers
5248480	5250480	No next question
5253120	5255120	Uh, I guess like if
5256400	5258640	No, no next question. I can't think of anyone
5259520	5262480	If given a chance to collab with any vtuber, who would it be?
5271360	5273360	Anyone really
5274080	5276080	Anyone really it's just um
5279440	5281040	Excuse me
5281040	5283040	Oh, I know I know who
5283760	5288400	If I could stream Natalia Sana, I want to tell her I learned
5290240	5292240	I'm cold from her
5297920	5299920	Thanks for teaching me Japanese
5309520	5311360	Um
5311440	5314080	If you're a vtuber avatar came to life, what do you think I'll say about you?
5317120	5319120	Senpai is mine
5319520	5321520	Get the fuck away from me
5322560	5324560	What's wrong with you?
5325680	5328240	She probably roast me real me
5329760	5332960	Oop k-fave drop I need my eyepatch back on
5333120	5335120	Oh
5339200	5341200	I'll be a cat fight pretty much
5348960	5350960	Okay, let's see
5350960	5352960	Uh
5365120	5367120	Congrats on debut mercy, thank you
5367440	5370560	My question is in your opinion after working in violor for some time now
5370640	5374240	How would you describe their management also ignore the question if you don't want to answer?
5374320	5376080	I don't want to get you in trouble
5376080	5380880	Um, probably not gonna get in trouble probably not maybe a little spanking but nah
5383520	5386400	Spanking my scrawny honestly should probably
5387440	5388880	wouldn't care
5388880	5389920	but
5389920	5395200	Oh management is great. Honestly management is great. I do not respect management. Just kidding
5399040	5401040	Just kidding I'm kidding
5401040	5403040	Um
5404480	5413040	Management is actually very competent. They answer my questions quickly. Um, I get a lot more freedom than I thought I would
5417040	5420640	I get a lot of freedom than I thought I would um
5420880	5422880	Um
5425680	5432640	Usually I would ask a simple question and then I'll get back to me almost as soon as as soon as I can so
5433440	5435440	I think um
5435760	5437760	I think management's pretty good
5438320	5440320	pretty good
5440880	5442880	I think it's more funny is uh
5443760	5445760	What's funny is that I expected to be like
5446720	5452240	There's some things that that management does tell me no no not at this time no no no and I'm okay with that
5452240	5454240	but I expected kind of like a
5456960	5462080	Like a more strict type of management is very it's been very lax
5463200	5464880	kind of like you know
5464880	5467600	Instead of like your strict parents. It'll be like you're cool
5468240	5471920	Your cool aunt or your cool uncle that still has to take care of you
5472800	5475680	But they let you do more things that maybe your parents don't
5479280	5481280	Kind of things like that
5483440	5486960	They let's just say that they'll wrangle me when they need to
5490160	5492160	If I go
5493280	5497040	If I go balls to the walls and they'll and then management goes
5497040	5499040	Mmm
5499280	5505760	Your channel might get struck and now and then I'll be like fair fair kind of thing. Okay
5510400	5513600	Does that make sense the I'm probably
5516400	5518400	So things
5520080	5522080	Okay
5527120	5529120	So things like that would
5529280	5534720	Generally, I'd generally say that they're very good, but I I am a lot more freedom than I expected
5536000	5539600	Sometimes I get to know sometimes I get a maybe not this time
5540080	5542080	But overall it's been pretty respectful
5542720	5544960	Even though I will clown on management when I can
5549920	5555520	That's all push it to the limits. I don't want to push things to the limit because I have a high respect
5556400	5561440	For scrawny and I don't want scrawny mad or upset because um, I'm just that thankful
5569520	5571520	That's all
5575200	5577200	Okay, that's all the questions I had whoa
5578720	5580720	How long have I been screaming for?
5580960	5585840	Ah, I got time. I got lots of time. I have so much energy right now
5587120	5589120	Sometimes give me all the energy
5610960	5612960	You
5631200	5633200	Oops
5636240	5638240	My bad
5641120	5643120	Okay, yeah
5645280	5647280	I thought I had everything ready. I didn't
5651200	5655760	Was that in some music as well. Whoa. Okay. Wow. I thought I added that in I didn't wow
5666000	5669040	So there we go. Okay. Oh, what was it?
5671280	5677200	Yeah, I had like a little speech and then I saw I saw that there was no audio
5683920	5690480	I just noticed you I can see your ears through your bangs. Yeah, my my my bangs are pretty thin paper thin even
5692800	5696400	Okay, uh, what was I saying? Oh my gosh, uh, I had a little speech
5696880	5701280	I wanted to talk about a little bit of my v-tipping journey. I hope you guys don't mind
5701840	5703120	um
5703120	5705840	About basically like my journey to get here
5706880	5708880	Just so you guys can get to know me better a little bit
5714560	5716560	Excuse me
5717040	5719040	So
5721760	5723760	Um
5723760	5725760	I
5725840	5727680	Auditioned to a lot of companies
5728560	5732240	Some gave me some chances. Some didn't uh, I'd never made it
5733120	5734320	to
5734320	5736880	Never made it into a place before though
5738240	5742480	Um, I got lots of views on my videos on my auditions and stuff
5743680	5745920	but together, um, I
5747120	5749120	When I first started my journey
5749760	5751200	forgetting here
5751200	5752320	I
5752320	5757600	Had a daruma doll and I filled in one eye and I said I want to get into a v-tipping company
5758160	5761360	And when I do I'm going to fill in the other da the other eye
5763120	5766000	And I showed strongy my daruma doll
5767280	5769280	of uh
5770240	5778240	Of the eye filled in and I was really happy that I was able to finally fill it in after after so long
5782320	5784320	And I was really happy
5785200	5787440	I started this journey actually
5788480	5790000	with
5790000	5792000	Serenity from vnu
5794080	5797600	Serenity and I worked very hard to achieve our dreams together
5802720	5805120	So I would consider serenity one of my best friends
5807600	5809920	And we cheered each other on all the time
5810880	5812880	So when she got into
5813680	5815120	vnu
5815120	5817760	I was very happy. I was cheering her on all the time
5820000	5822000	So
5823600	5826720	When I got into v allure we kind of
5828160	5833440	Got together and was like we did it. We did it. We reached our dreams
5836400	5838400	So we reached our dreams together
5839360	5841360	And I feel very happy about that
5845200	5852560	Which is why if you guys were like, oh, why is serenity so into why was she so into this company? It's because
5853840	5856240	We are close friends. We are close friends
5860400	5864880	So we spent nights sometimes together, uh
5865520	5869120	Oh gosh, I'm tearing up now because I love her so much
5874000	5876000	Um
5877520	5880480	We would spend some nights together reviewing our uh
5882080	5888320	Our audition videos with each other, um for companies and then we would uh
5891600	5893760	And then we could oh gosh
5895360	5897360	And
5901440	5908320	And we would talk about our dreams for hours and then you know, we would uh do calls together and stuff it was just it was just
5909680	5910880	It was just great
5910880	5914560	So when I got into the company and she got into the into a company
5914720	5921520	We were so happy for each other that we both reached our dreams finally because we both cheered each other on for so long
5925840	5928000	We both cheered each other for so long
5929840	5936720	And I'm so glad she fits perfectly in B&U and I feel like I fit perfectly in Bialore
5939920	5941920	So
5942320	5945360	She's my she's my best friend, uh
5955680	5959520	So she's my best friend and uh, she's been cheering me on
5959920	5966400	And she's like, I love you and then we go. I love you too. So we've been on this journey together for a while
5968800	5972480	I'll say some weird things too. It's it's it's weird
5976080	5982080	And I feel like I suit mercy perfectly and she suits serenity perfectly
5982080	5984080	Serenity perfectly
5984160	5985360	so
5985360	5987360	We are both very happy

6000320	6005680	And we're gonna keep doing it we're keep gonna we're just we're gonna keep going

6183360	6185360	You're going to get a job
6186800	6192960	And it was very specific it was like you're gonna get a job and a woman who
6193200	6197680	Where's a lot of black and maybe has black hair
6199120	6203040	Black hair and this is going to be a very strange a little bit of different work
6203600	6205600	But you're going to get a job. You're gonna
6206320	6210080	Be fulfilled and she's gonna help you get this job and she's gonna work and
6210880	6214000	Make your dream and help you reach your goals and I was like, oh
6215600	6217600	At the time I didn't think anything of it
6218160	6221760	And now I feel like you know the woman that that mama

6306960	6308960	I thought I didn't get in
6312880	6317680	I thought I didn't get in and so I know it's it's rude manners
6319520	6321520	But I was like, okay. Well
6322480	6326720	Whatever they might not respond to me, but here we go. I'll send an email asking for some feedback
6328400	6330080	I send an email
6330080	6334000	Getting for some feedback then I was like, okay, whatever. I gotta move on

6364320	6369680	So I was like, oh well, you know, I didn't get in but I'm going to support the company because I think I really believe in
6369920	6372560	scrawny stream. I really believe in scrawny stream. So I

7702000	7704400	Grrr, and you would hear and they're recording. I was like, oh
7707280	7709280	I kind of interfered

7746960	7751120	So I have that uh, I'm still kind of getting used to the three deal
7751280	7755440	I probably won't use it like a regular person would because I don't
7756880	7763680	I'm very ignorant of asmr stuff. So for triggers and stuff. I'm thinking about getting some things some some beauty
7764240	7766240	beauty beauty
7766320	7767360	tools
7767360	7774480	And trying them out on the three deal. I'm thinking about that. I still gotta go out and get them at like a discount shop
7778480	7780880	Are all asmr is gonna be spicy. Yes and no
7782160	7784480	Some will be spicy some will not be spicy
7785200	7790080	But I'm we're probably gonna play it safe and the spicy ones will be on patreon. Sorry
7798000	7802320	Seems you're interested in a bunch of suit of 51 games to see your favorite not necessarily
7802480	7804960	I just happen to be interested in like kind of
7805760	7807760	experimental games
7814640	7816640	Can you give us a hint on the asmr themes?
7817360	7818720	um
7818720	7822240	I haven't thought about it that far yet to be honest
7825280	7827440	I haven't thought about it from that far yet
7831600	7833600	Thank you for the tippy wippy
7837360	7840640	Hands i'm playing no more heroes. I want to play no more heroes on the Wii
7841360	7846160	I heard that you can pick up the phone on the Wii remote and then the sound comes out of the Wii remote like the
7846240	7847120	Like a phone
7847120	7851520	So I want to play you like that and I found and then apparently you can jork it you can jork the
7852640	7855120	The the Wii remote. I want to try it with the Wii
7861440	7865760	Johnny said equipment purchases are still going to come out of your future patrex though. Is that true? Yes
7866800	7870160	Only a part of it though. So it's easier
7871040	7886560	So it's easier so the cost of it is a little bit more down. Don't worry about it
7892080	7896320	Any interest in deadly premonitions or swearee games? Okay
7896720	7901680	Hey, I have oh my gosh. I my model's lagging. Oh, no
7903200	7906320	Uh, uh stop lagging you there you go
7910880	7913120	Daily premonitions, no probably not
7913120	7918960	Do you know why because I tried to play deadly premonition premonition and then uh on PC
7919280	7923280	and then I set stop and everything and it froze
7924080	7924960	at
7924960	7928000	I could not take out the screwdriver out of
7928720	7934640	The toolbox and then I went onto the forms and and google this and do you know what google said?
7936960	7940640	And I said how do I play this on PC know what I've said buy it on switch
7940640	7954320	Buy it on switch. It is an unplayable in PC form. So most likely I'm probably not gonna play
7955360	7957360	Because I don't want to buy another game again
7961280	7964320	So I don't want to go through that, you know
7967840	7969840	I don't want to go through that. Yeah, I don't
7971520	7973520	I don't want to
7975120	7980960	Yeah, pretty much it literally said how do I play it on PC? You don't I was like, how do I improve? How do I uh
7981440	7988480	Is there any any I don't know patches in order to to optimize the game and they said you want to play deadly premonition on PC
7989280	7991280	Buy it on switch
7991280	7993280	So
7998560	8008640	So no, I don't think so no until I get over my piss until I get over my anger about the PC part
8008640	8018320	Feelings on ps2 era horror like rule of rules. I never grew up on
8019280	8023040	On that type of game. I never got to play games. My first console was
8023680	8027840	a the ds lite so uh take that as you will my first
8028880	8034000	Home console was a ps4. So also take that as you will
8038720	8041280	I never got to experience the games that you guys played
8050320	8053840	So I'm excited to try out games that I've never tried before as well
8054480	8057920	I know like a lot of girls really love the retro games. I kind of don't want to step on their toes
8057920	8059920	but at the same time just kind of like
8060080	8062080	I want to play
8062160	8063280	older
8063280	8064560	jb
8064720	8065840	RPG
8065840	8068640	Maybe visual novel type games. Can I do that?
8069200	8071200	Am I gonna step on any toes?
8076800	8078800	Any games in mind as I said
8078800	8083840	as I said, um probably digital devil saga atelier series
8084560	8086560	wild arms are whatever
8087040	8089040	That word was
8089920	8091920	So
8093840	8096400	Yeah, those are the type of games that I want to try
8097200	8102560	As well and I want to play no more heroes specifically on the Wii because I want to draw. I want to draw the remote
8106560	8108560	Have you ever played or
8109200	8112240	Wanna leak leak leak. Oh, is that what it's called? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh
8113360	8115360	No
8119520	8121520	I have it
8129840	8131920	But yeah, I love I love those
8134160	8136160	I love those up any plans to playing
8137120	8140720	Uh, what was it doki doki literature club? Maybe
8142960	8144960	Maybe
8145680	8148560	It's a big maybe mostly because I already played
8149920	8154000	It already and I'm I remember I it's still fresh in my mind
8154160	8158480	So I kind of want to play games that are either not that fresh in my mind yet or
8159520	8161680	Kind of something that I haven't really played
8167120	8171680	So I would really do you like platformer games. I'm really bad at platformers
8172800	8175440	Uh, I don't have but I I do like playing them
8176400	8180400	I want to play uh some mario games as well some some mario games
8180400	8185120	I actually got my hands on mario like the remake of mario rpg
8185520	8189440	But I'd really like to try that out as well. I know it's the remake. It's not like the real deal
8190000	8194080	But I I have it in order to experience it for the first time
8198240	8204240	So I really for the DS games I have tons of games that I played on the DS. I have such fond memories of them
8206000	8209360	I don't have a DS that I can stream from though, so
8210880	8213040	I cannot stream DS games
8215520	8219440	Thousand Year Door is fantastic if you haven't played it. I played Thousand Year Door on the GameCube
8220320	8223280	I managed to borrow GameCube from a friend and
8224640	8226640	I played it. I played the whole thing
8227200	8229200	I
8234720	8237760	I wasn't expecting to see harvester on someone's schedule. Oh
8240080	8245920	Okay, this is gonna sound weird, but I learned of harvester. I know of harvester and I played a bit of harvester
8247360	8249360	in university
8250640	8252160	In
8252160	8254160	uh, we were playing a bunch of
8254880	8257840	uh, games so the first game that I played in a
8259520	8261520	For my class, it's a
8261840	8263840	history of video games
8263920	8270640	Uh course that I took uh first game. I played uh kind of like the FMV style was
8272480	8274480	Seventh guest
8275200	8277200	So
8281920	8285840	I played seventh guest and oh my gosh, I found out the one
8286560	8292960	Game the the the virus game was based off of your clock. So when I was trying to play it, it was it's rough
8293200	8295200	It was rough
8296320	8298320	That's a course of course
8300080	8302080	Of course
8305440	8310160	Check your university. You'll probably you'll probably find a lot of fine courses
8310960	8314720	Uh, I didn't get to take this one, but there was uh history of anime
8316400	8318400	Uh and
8320160	8324320	History of hentai as well. I didn't get to take those two, but I really wanted to
8327600	8330480	Oh, did you get to play hotel dusk on the ds? Yes
8334880	8336880	But yeah
8337520	8340560	Actually, I actually decided on my own to like do
8341920	8347360	I borrowed the syllabus from a friend who was taking some of those courses and I I decided to study it
8347840	8349840	Oh my god
