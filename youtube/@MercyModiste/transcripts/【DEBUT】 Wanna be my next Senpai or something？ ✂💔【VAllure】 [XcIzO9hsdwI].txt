it's always one heartbreak after another there are people who just love the
drama of relationship but I don't think anyone specifically pines for heartbreak
I mean I always give my best I try to be more than fair as a girlfriend but
sometimes I get nit thinking that somehow it's all my fault I just can't
wrap my head around how that could be possible it's times like this where I
try to think back to the start of my love life starting with my first love and
first loss maybe try to compare and see where I went wrong this time it started
back in early college I was studying to become a fashion designer if you can
believe that I wasn't as well deliciously brazen in my outfit choices as I am now
a quiet much too overlooked girl who never got invited to parties their loss
though I imagine I had more fun sewing crafting and anything else a grandma
would do with spare time an old soul people would call me I was content in
my own quiet that was until I met my first love I don't know what he saw in
me but he was the one to make the first move even before I had the mind
to dress to attract the male gaze here I was more of an all-miss chic ghost
whatever the reason here was a man who takes charge where he needs to he was
a dirty rabid-looking man who stank of booze and ooze failure and degeneracy in
retrospect in our first meeting it was a bit more pushy than I'm used to
nowadays it's best to understand that the pillar of a strong relationship is
setting up boundaries and it's best to do it as soon as possible putting your
foot down telling your partner what's what it's a risk you have to take it was
because of that I remember that I always keep my fabric scissors with me when
you interact with your partner honestly if the love is true they can feel your
intent that's when the honest purest part of them comes out my favorite stage
in all of my relationships it was like he was a completely different person
from his introduction he showed me his true self a part men are taught to hide
away the soft sweet vulnerable man inside I mean how could I not fall for him I
don't think I have a particular type per se but a man who expresses his
emotions in such a delicious way that's something I couldn't resist I just had
to have him I had brought him to an old shed my family owns the best I could do
at the time but together our love can make it all you see good relationships
are built on compromise and I and compromise I did I gave that man
everything everything you could ever want I bathed him fed him cared for him
gave myself to him the time we spent I gave him all I had to give that's what
relationships are I give and take you give your all to someone and you expect
them to do the same for you and you know what he does just runs away out of the
blue no talking no indication anything is wrong just leaves I couldn't
understand I was high off of my affection for him and I thought he was
the same but I had to hold in my sadness I for one am better than leaving
without a word relationships no matter what should be ended properly after all
sometimes relationships don't work out for reasons you don't understand but
where there was true love there can be a lot of fun to be had right before
cutting ties
after that it was fling after fling a new love here and there all ending the
same way I hate having to be the nice one in the relationship it can't be my
fault I guess men will take any chance to abuse your kindness now the breakup
songs on the radio start to make sense and the sweetest sugars are now as
bitter as vinegar it's times like this when I think I'm about to give up on
love entirely but as they say time heals all wounds after that it feels like
the very first time
wake up Senpai Senpai wake up oh you're still a bit dizzy that's okay I hit
you on the head pretty hard up an atom though it's a shame but we don't have
a lot of time together welcome Senpai I finally have you I've been waiting for
this moment for so long and I hear you've been waiting for me too what do
you think of icy and Azra's debut don't you just want to cuddle icy and Azra
makes you feel so protected right fortunately for you I will also keep

special love diary with all the information about me that you need to
know so we can be together forever and I'll have all the time in the world to
get to know you too so let's get started my name is mercy modeste mercy being the
last thing people say before they're killed and modeste meaning dressmaker

don't like carbonation I don't like math and numbers because it's harder to
memorize like memorizing your phone number Senpai is so hard and where you

really hard to memorize all that so please memorize all this you'll make me
very very very happy if you do all right oh here we go here's my favorite
anime it's okay if you don't know these but if you do know these you are based
and super lit etc but if you don't know these that's okay I'm kind of pretentious

down here oh oh who put that there these are my weaknesses it's it's fine for
for my senpais to know because weaknesses are have to be shared with each
other so my weakness is motion sickness I'm sorry that's that is why most of my
games are like that I have very bad motion sickness that I'm trying to get
over impatient I mean sorry that's the third thing in the way overthinking I
tend to overthink a lot and if things are too simple I might in puzzles I might
overthink them and just go like no it can't be that simple and of course in
patience I'm I'm a little impatient with a lot of things so please forgive me
after all we all have weaknesses all right okay okay here are my goals senpai
I have so many goals I have so many goals if I have more and I went through them
take a long time to get through so here are just a handful that I picked so my
goals are to pursue voice acting and appear in an anime or video game move
to a place with better internet get a sound isolation booth get over my
motion sickness to play first-person games host a concert and perform 3d
lives or events or even 3d skits to bring to life my original songs that I
wrote I have a few written in my notes to have a product based off of me to
bring home a play button for my mother who's always wanted to see one to reach
over a million senpai's and make them smile and to make memories with you my
darling senpai and of course the best one of all to reach my perfect fairytale
happily ever after understand and I won't let anyone get in that way
all right here are my tags senpai I have no idea I'm not very creative I'm not

gen mates aren't they super cute these are drawn in the style of set cheese like

first impressions of my gen mates is that in me is surprisingly hick but in a
cute way baby girl can be quite ruthless super talented at everything she does

I first saw her I thought she would be super messy get key and guess what I was

that she likes she has really good food and she's a really passionate and
amazing DJ you guys saw that set right so good and then there's mommy
mommy sometimes I'm scared of her not gonna lie sometimes I'm scared of her
but I feel very loved she's easygoing as much as she doesn't say she's like she
says that she's not professional I believe she's super professional as well
and she's very clumsy but in a like a super cute way she be she be is so brave
like everything is waters off the ducks back very independent cool independent
woman she's a hard worker maybe she works too hard she has such a wide range in
her voice as well so I think that's really cool that she's like able to reach
different voice tones that's that's really amazing

her colors or like a fortune teller she is mommy like that's it she's mommy that's
