32
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I changed the camera-

You saved the video.

34
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,580

37
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,860
Why did I quit?

38
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I don't want to tie my hits, that requires thinking.

39
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Oh, eventually you might get tired.

40
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Today might not be that day.

41
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,800
You got any shotgun ammo?

42
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:13,440
I read in like chat a while ago, and I remember this specifically, that the shotgun will be

43
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,800
needed to fight someone else, specifically.

44
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,800
What's he even hitting you with?

45
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,800
His aw.

46
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
What's the cleaver from the chef?

47
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm pretty sure that's the weakest weapon.

48
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Oh, we poked it at the same time! That is not fair! That is so not fair!

49
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:08,800
What the heck?

50
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
That was so rude.

51
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:26,800
It was progress. I was smashing much better than usual.

52
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:36,800
We got this. Probably.

53
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Wow, I swear most people will probably be like, this is such an easy fight and me.

54
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Did you see that?

55
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Steve, would you like my autograph, Steve? Here you go, then. I'm just range rider, the cowpoke's cowpoke.

56
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:39,800
What's in here?

57
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Looks like Tom is ahead.

58
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,800
You got anything here?

59
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Is there anything in this room?

60
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Some classic one-armed bandits.

61
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Some out-of-town stations.

62
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Oh, battle music. The present picture of Morris' foot sucker, McGee, in a cradle.

63
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Hey, senpai, which one of this is you?

64
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Which one of you is foot sucker?

65
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Morris McGee.

66
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,800
I got a gumball. Can I get a gumball?

67
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:41,800
You get the gumball feel better. Can I have another one?

68
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Gosh, is this like infinite health?

69
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Oh, I look rough.

70
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm going to do it again.

71
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm going to do it again.

72
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Wait, is that it?

73
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Oh, I'm back again. I'm back to normal health.

74
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Let's see what else is around here. This looks like batter up.

75
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Gimme.

76
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Thank you.

77
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Looks like Tom is ahead.

78
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Someone's scratched.

79
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Is there anything I can find here?

80
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,800
This is therapeutic. Honestly, I have...

81
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Yesterday, I still have the chewing gum.

82
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Actually, the taffy thing that was from yesterday, it's gum.

83
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
It's gum.

84
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Did you save? I'm going to save again, then.

85
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Guess for you, senpai.

86
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Gum.

87
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,800
It was all gum. Actually, the two candies with the oil wrappers were just hard candy.

88
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I think it had a sold-off flavor.

89
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
I feel like there's more. Both teens are the same color.

90
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,800
There has to be more, right?

91
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Which one won?

92
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Bruce M holds the high score.

93
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
I feel like...

94
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Did I hit this scratch?

95
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Can I get this?

96
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Oh, yes!

97
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Can I get anything from this body? Walk over here.

98
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Can I touch this?

99
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Walk.

100
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Hello. Thank you. Thank you for walking.

101
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Someone scratched. Someone scratched.

102
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,800
There's nothing hidden in here. Is there?

103
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,800
There's a pot. Is there...?

104
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,800
There's nothing in here.

105
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
There's nothing.

106
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
You.

107
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
That was such a troll thing!

108
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,800
That was so rude!

109
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:16,800
I got this!

110
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Oh, the body's gone!

111
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Senpai, the body's gone!

112
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Wait!

113
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,800
The p- thingy's here.

114
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:35,800
How do you avoid that?

115
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I have meat!

116
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I have meat on me!

117
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Come on.

118
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Just making sure.

119
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I feel like I'm missing something.

120
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Like, what is this?

121
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Is this just a scratch?

122
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Or is this something?

123
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I think that's it.

124
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:19,800
There's nothing else here, right?

125
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Okay.

126
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Goodbye, parcel.

127
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Bugger off!

128
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,800
You.

129
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Someone must have mistaken this for the toilet.

130
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Eww!

131
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Can a parcel bag empty a parcel bag?

132
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
What the hell is that?

133
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
No!

134
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
I don't trust it.

135
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
I don't trust it.

136
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I don't trust it.

137
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Save game.

138
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Please wipe Senpai.

139
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Nasty restroom.

140
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:33,800
The roaches are crazed by the succulent riches contained herein.

141
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Do I want to flush?

142
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Olive-toned slime run down these bowls.

143
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Obviously the products of a vegetarian with the runs.

144
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Wait, there's something there.

145
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
This pesticides contains DDT.

146
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Mine.

147
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
They're empty.

148
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
They're empty.

149
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,800
What's this?

150
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
No?

151
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Did I look at the tub?

152
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,800
The lodge version of an ancient Roman vomitorium.

153
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Grills.

154
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Anything.

155
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Anything.

156
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Do I steal this?

157
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Someone must have mistaken this for the toilet.

158
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Can I open that?

159
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

160
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Go back.

161
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Thank you.

162
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Are those just toilet paper then?

163
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:39,800
What's this?

164
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I got this.

165
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Eagle.

166
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Okay.

167
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Am I feeling nostalgic because of the Roman vomitorium?

168
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Not really.

169
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Okay, now that we've got...

170
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:25,800
What do I have in my inventory?

171
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I think it was this away.

172
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Yeah, pesticides.

173
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Rough up the plant.

174
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Hopefully.

175
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Can we kill her?

176
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Yeah!

177
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Sky!

178
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Is there anything?

179
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Wait.

180
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,800
An odd shaped hole raised surface.

181
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,800
What's this hole look like?

182
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Bar key?

183
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Bar key goes here?

184
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Well, that didn't work.

185
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Wait, there's something I could pick up?

186
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Hold on.

187
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
A closed gate.

188
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Open this.

189
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:29,800
I swear I thought I saw something I could pick up, though.

190
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:42,800
A cooling, refreshing fountain.

191
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Oh, I have a cup.

192
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
I have a cup.

193
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Well, that didn't work.

194
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
The fuck do you mean that didn't work?

195
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Well, that didn't work.

196
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Dammit, dammit, dammit!

197
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:02,800
What do you mean that didn't work?

198
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Oh, the plant's gone.

199
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
What if I use...

200
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Well, that didn't work.

201
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Or...

202
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,800
The baseball bat!

203
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Well, that didn't work.

204
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Thanks.

205
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Great!

206
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Is there anything I can get?

207
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,800
No?

208
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Well, that didn't work.

209
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Well...

210
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
It's like I got here.

211
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Now what?

212
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Do I, like, look at my face?

213
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Oh, wait.

214
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Maybe I'll just...

215
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,800
I'll just use all of it, you know?

216
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Okay.

217
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Um...

218
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
The harvest...

219
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Well, that didn't work.

220
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Wait, maybe the harvest blade would work on that.

221
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Harvest blade.

222
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Dammit.

223
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Dammit!

224
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Is something in the water?

225
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm trying to see.

226
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Are we pixel hunting?

227
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Do you see something, Senpai?

228
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Do you see what I see?

229
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

230
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
What?

231
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:40,800
my shoulder. I see a baka on my right. Mods obliterate. I see a reflection.

232
00:28:40,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Now for real, something right shoulder, something there. This one? Thank you for having good eyes.

233
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Holy shit, those are good eyes.

234
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Is it me that goes here? Secret door!

235
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Yeah!

236
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:02,800
We're all foul smelling liquid. Can I use my cup on that one?

237
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Well that didn't work.

238
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Oh man.

239
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:14,800
This non-functioning power blocks.

240
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,800
I got him!

241
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Is there anything in here?

242
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:51,800
I did it!

243
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Can I hit it?

244
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Do I use a baseball bat with it?

245
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Well that didn't work.

246
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Oh shit! Look at my health! Awful! Eat the sandwich boy.

247
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Anything else around here?

248
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I can't tell you how to do it all over here. It's always luck.

249
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,800
No?

250
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Can I get the WD-40?

251
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Cinder block anything?

252
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:01,800
It doesn't seem to be.

253
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Do I use the bar key on it?

254
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Well that didn't work.

255
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Oh wait, maybe just the rope, yeah.

256
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,800
The rope looks sturdy enough to climb.

257
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,800
As you grab the rope you hear a scream quickly climb to investigate.

258
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Ha!

259
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Welcome to the Harvest Moon Art Gallery, sir. I'm the curator of this place. So delighted you could come.

260
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Um, I expected to be an engaging experience.

261
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,800
That it will, I'm afraid. Art often forces engagement, doesn't it?

262
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Oh yeah, it does.

263
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Pastoral scenes, noble sculptures. These are easy on the ironed mind.

264
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:11,800
But when confronted with a work of hideous form, you're forced to deal with it, even if only to dismiss it as trash.

265
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Sadly, the most extreme works are the hardest to dismiss.

266
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Protesqueries and midworks of beauty are necessary.

267
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Hold on, we're learning today.

268
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Nevertheless, it's important that each individual determine his own sense of aesthetics.

269
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:35,800
For that reason, I give you permission to obliterate that, which forces you to linger too long in the gallery.

270
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
I'm just passing through.

271
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
If only it were that simple.

272
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:50,800
What? Walk over here. Very disturbing painting. It looks like a normal painting.

273
00:33:51,800 --> 00:34:03,800
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! I have to kill him!

274
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Is that what he's telling me? I gotta kill him? I gotta kill him?

275
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Welcome to the harv-

276
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Okay, I'm gonna see. Can't wait to see what passes for art in this hellhole.

277
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,800
It's always the dilemma, sir. What are the boundaries of art?

278
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Only you can answer that, and only for yourself.

279
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Lovely works, pastoral scenes, noble sculptures.

280
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,800
These are easy on the eye and mind, but when confronted with a work of hideous form,

281
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,800
you're forced to deal with it, even if only to dismiss it as trash.

282
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Sadly, the most extreme works are the hardest to dismiss.

283
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Protesqueries and midworks of beauty are necessary.

284
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Oh, wait. I can go this way. You're right. I don't have to kill him.

285
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,800
What's the heck's this? Sickeningly offensive.

286
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
I don't see anything offensive! Senpai, do you?

287
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Alright.

288
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Hahaha!

289
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Strangely, calming.

290
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,800
That one's a little disturbing. Looks like it was painted with fresh blood.

291
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Ah.

292
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,800
This cow better not fucking attack me!

293
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Firstly abstract.

294
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,800
B-19 in flight.

295
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Great group of guys.

296
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Heavy and intimidating.

297
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Fuck you!

298
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I hate art. Just kidding. I love art, but it seems to stare back at you.

299
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Absolutely revolting.

300
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Mercy, there was a door, but there's so much more in this art gallery!

301
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,800
You understand, right, Senpai? You understand, there was a door, but there...

302
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,800
I haven't looked at the rest of the gallery yet.

303
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Like, you have to go through an entire exhibition before you go to the next one, right?

304
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
When you go to a museum.

305
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Sculpture is morbid, but strangely erotic.

306
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Huh?

307
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Like, you understand, right?

308
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,800
We are art enjoyers here. Enjoyers.

309
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Oh, we're back here now.

310
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Now he's in my way. I don't want to kill him, though.

311
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,800
They don't re- They don't respawn, do they?

312
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Okay, good.

313
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Okay.

314
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Strange group of guys. Are these the people who made Harvester?

315
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,800
The door is locked.

316
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,800
We have a key. We have another key.

317
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Oh, we have a key.

318
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
I should have saved.

319
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,800
I should have saved. I'm gonna save now.

320
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,800
I thought about that as I went through the door.

321
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Art!

322
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,800
What's with all these exits?

323
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Huh? There's so many doors.

324
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Excuse me. You can't come in right now. I just mopped the floor.

325
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Oh, okay. Sorry about that. Um...

326
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Hey, buddy. Give me a break, will ya? Keep up the floor.

327
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Hey, buddy. Give me a...

328
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Okay, uh...

329
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
Is there anything I need here?

330
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir. I'll wait until you're done.

331
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I don't want to walk on it.

332
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,800
I respect... I respect the janitor.

333
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
I think it's the janitor.

334
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
What the heck are these?

335
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
A rook-shaped ashtray.

336
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Aw, I don't want to play chess.

337
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,800
What's in here?

338
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Bye.

339
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
I look like a big boss.

340
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Give me a second.

341
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Where the heck are all these?

342
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
I don't know.

343
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
This was the art gallery, right?

344
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Yeah, that's the art gallery. Okay.

345
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Oh, my gosh. There's so many things.

346
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Well, let's go in here first.

347
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Oh, hi.

348
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Can I help you?

349
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Wait! You're the... You're the lady.

350
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
This is a library, not a brothel.

351
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,800
You don't understand. I have reason.

352
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I hope to believe that she was brought here.

353
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
You're the lady at the grocery store.

354
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
What?!

355
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
What do you mean, extant?

356
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Aw, what do you want?

357
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Since he is so highly regarded among the order,

358
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,800
I'm loathed to approach him on such an embarrassing matter.

359
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Therefore, bring me the book and I'll help you.

360
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
How will I know which book?

361
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Oh, you'll know it. He's not an avid reader.

362
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800
Okay, uh...

363
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
Can I...

364
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
This is...

365
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
You don't...

366
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm...

367
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Let's see the other one.

368
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Well...

369
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
You're a woman.

370
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm not a member.

371
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,800
You are kept here for the services they are able to render.

372
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Just as some jobs are beneath men,

373
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,800
so too can certain services only be supplied by women.

374
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,800
If she is here, you'll find her on the third floor,

375
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,800
which you'll have difficulty finding without my help.

376
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Nah, I don't agree.

377
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
And you want something in return.

378
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Marcy, do you know how to play chess?

379
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I'll give you a clue as to how to get to the third floor,

380
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,800
but only if you'll retrieve an overdue book from one of...

381
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
How will I...

382
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Can I...

383
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Room filled with unread books?

384
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Can I come in?

385
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Can I look at stuff?

386
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Wait, there's a chair there.

387
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Hold on.

388
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Now, nothing to do with the chair.

389
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
The door is locked.

390
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
Borrowed on the other side.

391
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Yeah, save your game.

392
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Okay.

393
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
I'll save it back in art.

394
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

395
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

396
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Bum, bum, bum.

397
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Shit.

398
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
Where's the exit again?

399
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
Ah, not that one.

400
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Hi?

401
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Let me see.

402
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,800
Oh yes, the new initiate.

403
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
Well, you're the postmaster, right?

404
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
What can I do for you?

405
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Um, I'm looking for a girl named Stephanie.

406
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,800
The lodge is a traditional place young man,

407
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,800
and by tradition, when a young man is courting a young woman,

408
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,800
he wins for her a Cupid doll at the fair.

409
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
A what?

410
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
There is no fair within the lodge.

411
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
Wait, the Cupid doll, the naked baby?

412
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,800
However, I have seen a thing which resembles a Cupid somewhere on this floor.

413
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Seek it out, slay it, and return here with a prize if you would seek your lady.

414
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,800
I'm sorry, the naked baby?

415
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Cupid doll?

416
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Yeah, like Cupid male, the Cupid doll, right?

417
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,800
What are the other fairly familiar thinkers?

418
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Are these the actors?

419
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
Let me see.

420
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Let's see, can you get me out a little?

421
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Shortly, you will run into a fellow named Mr. Cain.

422
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
He has the strength of the truly insane.

423
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,800
You will need help to get past him.

424
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,800
They say that music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.

425
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
Music alone won't do the trick,

426
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,800
but an appreciation of music may net you something that will.

427
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Appreciation of music?

428
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Must you thrill rug me out to the wall?

429
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Dolphins!

430
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,800
A beautiful grand piano.

431
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Is this the music part?

432
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Rough, hewn statue of a dolphin.

433
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
I like piano stuff.

434
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
Ah, stay in this dolphin room, what?

435
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:58,800
Is Mercy holding a comically sized crowbar, or is it the scythe?

436
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
It's the scythe!

437
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:09,800
Is the puzzle, do you, senpai, do you think the puzzle is me listening to the music a bit?

438
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:29,800
Oh, I can hear dolphins now.

439
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Okay, I need to spot the pixel.

440
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Okay, I need to spot the pixel.

441
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,800
It ain't fine, it ain't taste filler.

442
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
This one?

443
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,800
You see anything, senpai?

444
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,800
Fines?

445
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,800
Do I cut it with the scythe?

446
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
Well, that didn't work.

447
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Well, that didn't work.

448
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,800
There's something I'm supposed to see.

449
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
Damn it!

450
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
Ha ha ha!

451
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,800
Oh wait, there's like a swordfish thing?

452
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Or is that a part of the dolphin, can I knock that off?

453
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,800
Oh wait, that's the tail, I'm so stupid!

454
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
Okay.

455
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
Nice dolphin!

456
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,800
Oh wait, what was that?

457
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
Poker?

458
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
Okay.

459
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,800
To be fair, side perspective made it look like a spike.

460
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,800
I thought it was a spike too, I got the poker, yeah!

461
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Is that it, in this room?

462
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
Good, one more thing in here.

463
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
Okay, what else is in here then?

464
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,800
The hooked frail.

465
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
Frail.

466
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
And the vine.

467
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,800
Frail.

468
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
On the tillers as well?

469
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,800
You saw it on here.

470
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,800
Okay.

471
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,800
I think you might have grabbed it already.

472
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,800
Oh the, I think I got the poker.

473
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,800
No, I got a flail.

474
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,800
Never mind, I got the flail!

475
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
I need to find a poker, right?

476
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,800
You need poking?

477
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Epic flail!

478
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Nobody says epic anymore, do they?

479
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Poker?

480
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
Poker?

481
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,800
Pok, pok, pok, pok, pok, pok, pok, pok, pok, pok, pok.

482
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,800
I said before it became a slang, it didn't stop.

483
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
We're bringing it back.

484
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Let me see.

485
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,800
Is it off the screen where I can't see it, do you?

486
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Some guys, do you remember when I had like the problem

487
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,800
where I could not see off the screen?

488
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
I can't see it.

489
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Maybe adjust the screen a bit to see what you need to.

490
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
I can look over here, I think.

491
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Oh no, maybe I should go.

492
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,800
Actually, I think Senpai's...

493
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,800
Is that all four pillars?

494
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
I think so.

495
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,800
I feel like this is the one where I got the little flail?

496
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,800
Okay, so this one's the one I got the flail.

497
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
Maybe it's one of the other ones?

498
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
Yeah.

499
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
It's not on the...

500
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Dolphin, right?

501
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,800
You missed on the first two. Wait, what?

502
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,800
Huh?

503
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,800
I think this is so hard to find, it's a finding click.

504
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Also, hint books.

505
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,800
You know, back in the day, Senpai, they sold hint books.

506
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,800
They sold hint books, and you have to call in

507
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,800
and order to get hints to continue in the game

508
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,800
and that's how they made a lot more money.

509
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,800
The pay to win, 50 cents a minute.

510
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
Yeah, the hint hotlines.

511
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
Alright, the strategy guides.

512
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,800
I am serious though, I don't see anything.

513
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,800
I called the Nintendo power hotline once. How was it?

514
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,800
Don't they still make strategy books, Senpai?

515
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,800
Anything at the bottom of the pillar?

516
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,800
I'm trying to click, it is beyond me.

517
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:56,800
Okay, all you gotta do is click the left piss pixel at the base of the vine.

518
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
Base? Base?

519
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,800
Hold on, I gotta make sure.

520
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,800
He's like, we're gonna be stuck here forever!

521
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
Sorry, I was joking.

522
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,800
Sorry, you're so mean!

523
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
I am gullible!

524
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
I am gullible, Senpai!

525
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,800
I'm so gullible!

526
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,800
I'm so gullible!

527
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,800
I'm really gullible, okay?

528
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Maybe we should check the inventory, I only got the flayly thingy.

529
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:25,800
Honestly, I remember when I would fall for this every time, someone would say something like,

530
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:33,800
oh, giraffe or gullible is written on the ceiling and I would look up and I'd be like, no it's not!

531
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Is it on this screen or is it like...

532
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:07,800
You know, I only got you once, right? No, I got caught with it a lot of time and then the one that's like,

533
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:14,800
did you know that gullible rhymes with giraffe and I went, giraffe, no it doesn't!

534
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,800
I fell for it every time!

535
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:27,800
I fell for it every time, like a fool!

536
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,800
Senpai, I'm like blind as a bat!

537
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,800
You are gonna have to tell me exactly where it is.

538
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
Which pillar it is.

539
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,800
It's actually pronounced jubilee, shut the fuck up!

540
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,800
Just take the eyepatch off!

541
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,800
Oh shit, it's not there.

542
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,800
Play the piano, Kohai!

543
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:36,800
I don't know, I can play a little bit, you know, maybe it's in piano, piano?

544
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,800
Like, I'm clicking everywhere, I'm clicking everywhere.

545
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Maybe I need to go back and then...

546
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,800
Uh, like, hot cross buns.

547
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:37,800
No. It's been so long since I played the harmonica, I played it in like, elementary, middle school.

548
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,800
Play Wonderwall!

549
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,800
Wait, I played that wrong.

550
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Whatever.

551
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,800
I put it back, I put it away.

552
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,800
Is it on a chair?

553
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,800
Is it over there?

554
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,800
This one looks like funky, right?

555
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,800
Maybe I need to cut the strange vine off.

556
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,800
Well that didn't work.

557
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,800
Well that didn't work!

558
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,800
Can you play? Thanks, no!

559
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,800
Maybe you got all I need, thank you!

560
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
Senpai!

561
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:17,800
Thank you, I have an Australian $2 coin. Oh, thank you for the Aussie $2 coin, which equals to $1.33.

562
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:45,800
There's a $2 coin? Yeah, in Canada there's also a $2 coin, it's kind of toony.

563
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,800
I don't want to play chess.

564
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
These ashtrays?

565
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,800
Oh wait, I got a shotgun shell, thank you.

566
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,800
Yeah, these ones.

567
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,800
A toony? Yeah!

568
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:18,800
Honestly, I was going to be like, oh, when I was doing my advice screen for how much shampoo you should use, I was like, you should use...

569
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:29,800
You should use something, a dollop the size of a loonie, and then I realized, you don't have...

570
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,800
Wait, a lot of you don't have a loonie, so I don't know if you have what it is.

571
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,800
Okay, hold on, let's save here for a second.

572
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,800
Because I was like, I don't know if you have that.

573
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,800
An excellent likeness in oil, so not.

574
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,800
An also tasteful sofa.

575
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:19,800
First place trophy in the Cabinet Makers Union Chapter 501 Special Chess Olympics for different abled spinal injury victims.

576
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:30,800
A comfy sofa, a comfy chair, a comfy chair, a reflection of excellent likeness in oil.

577
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,800
An intellectual arena.

578
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:44,800
First place trophy in the first annual Parallel Pioria Monster Chess Surama in the Bake Off.

579
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,800
I am the chess master.

580
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,800
Any initiate who wishes to pass this way must do so for my dead body.

581
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,800
Being a civilized man, I offer my opponents a choice.

582
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,800
Solve my problem or fight me to the death.

583
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Do you know how to play chess?

584
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,800
I sort of know how to play chess.

585
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,800
Yes?

586
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,800
In that case, make me what you may pass.

587
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,800
Wait, hold up.

588
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,800
Hold up.

589
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,800
Did you say make me?

590
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,800
Did you say made me?

591
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,800
Made?

592
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
Made?

593
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,800
Well, ten pies.

594
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,800
You may say move D6 to B7, move B8 to whatever.

595
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,800
I don't know what that means.

596
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,800
Okay, what am I?

597
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,800
I am...

598
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,800
I am...

599
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,800
Am I the white one?

600
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:13,800
If I go there, it will... this thing will jump over, right?

601
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,800
And if I go here, it will get over here, right?

602
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,800
But that's also like... I can't remember how the king moves.

603
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,800
I don't know how the king moves, Senpai.

604
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:44,800
The king can only move one space in any direction.

605
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,800
Well, if I move here, the king can move diagonally, right?

606
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,800
Well, I'm looking at this so far.

607
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Look, if I go here, see, right?

608
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,800
This square right here, it will move diagonally, right?

609
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
I go here.

610
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,800
This might work.

611
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,800
Yeah, but you can't move your king in a space that puts him in checkmate.

612
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,800
Bottom right is the only option, this one.

613
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:33,800
King can't eat the horse since it's guarded by your knight.

614
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,800
Wait, what?

615
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,800
The king can't eat the knight.

616
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,800
Yes, they can, can't they?

617
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
That's chess!

618
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,800
You can get your pieces, right?

619
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,800
No, you're lying to me.

620
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,800
You're lying to me.

621
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,800
Look, the queen's not on the chess board, Senpai!

622
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,800
Koai, please, fine.

623
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,800
There you go.

624
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:34,800
Well, why can't he move?

625
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,800
Chess is a civilized game.

626
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:57,800
How sad, but it allows it to a less civilized form of conflict.

627
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,800
Chess is a civilized game.

628
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,800
What?!

629
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,800
Chess!

630
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,800
How did I do that?

631
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,800
I don't know how I did that, but thanks.

632
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,800
Did I skip a cutscene?

633
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,800
I technically didn't want to hit him.

634
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,800
I really didn't want to hit him.

635
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,800
Excellent stroke.

636
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,800
I didn't mean to hit him!

637
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,800
I just don't know!

638
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,800
I just don't know chess that well!

639
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,800
I want us to win the chess game.

640
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,800
Okay, fine, I can load again, Senpai.

641
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,800
I can load again.

642
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,800
We can try this again.

643
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,800
There you go.

644
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,800
You can go here.

645
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,800
Where should I go to next, Senpai?

646
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,800
Do I grab this guy?

647
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,800
Chess is a civilized game.

648
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,800
How sad, but it allows it to a less civilized form of conflict.

649
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,800
I went the wrong way.

650
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,800
I can do it again!

651
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,800
I can do it again, Senpai.

652
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,800
Don't worry, I got this.

653
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,800
He just hit himself.

654
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,800
Don't worry about it.

655
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:27,800
Also, I've noticed the cutscenes are a little bit broken.

656
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,800
I wanted to go here, right?

657
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,800
And then...

658
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,800
You go here, right?

659
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,800
And then...

660
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,800
Senpai wanted me to go here.

661
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,800
Wait!

662
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:13,800
He did the same thing anyways!

663
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,800
He did the same thing anyways!

664
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,800
It's the same thing!

665
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,800
What the heck?!

666
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,800
He just cut himself!

667
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,800
Okay, thanks for the key.

668
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Alright.

669
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,800
Don't just say alright!

670
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,800
The illusion of free choice.

671
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,800
That's our gore.

672
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,800
Like, who put a key in his head?

673
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,800
Well, we did it, Senpai.

674
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,800
Let's save again.

675
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,800
We fought fairly.

676
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
Keep yourself safe.

677
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,800
I can't believe it was just the same thing.

678
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,800
Actually, I can't believe it.

679
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,800
Okay.

680
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,800
Hold on.

681
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,800
I wanted to check.

682
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,800
Senpai!

683
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,800
Senpai!

684
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,800
Kai, I have a booboo.

685
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,800
Can you kiss it better?

686
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,800
No.

687
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,800
Hahahaha!

688
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,800
Hahahaha!

689
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,800
Wow!

690
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,800
Maybe the dolphins might know something.

691
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
Dolphine.

692
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,800
Dolphine.

693
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,800
Dolphin.

694
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,800
Dolphin.

695
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,800
Phin, Phin, Phin, Phin!

696
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,800
Sometimes, chess gives...

697
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,800
Oh, wait.

698
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,800
No, it says something.

699
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
Something just gives me a splitting headache.

700
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,800
I mean, that was definitely a headache.

701
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,800
Are you sure there was a fire poker here, Senpai?

702
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,800
What's the key for?

703
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,800
I don't know.

704
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,800
Oh, wait.

705
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,800
Maybe the...

706
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,800
Right, the one room.

707
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
Here, right?

708
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,800
This is the wrong key.

709
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,800
Well, that didn't work.

710
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,800
I forgot where that room with the guy is.

711
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,800
Hey, buddy, give me a break, will ya?

712
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,800
Keep up the floor.

713
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,800
Yeah, yeah, I will, I will!

714
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
Sorry, I was just looking.

715
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,800
I'm sorry, I'm just looking around.

716
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,800
This is awesome.

717
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,800
Give me a...

718
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,800
Give me a look.

719
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,800
Mellow drama is involving the brutal murder of men

720
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,800
by ungrateful suffragettes.

721
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,800
Or popular with the wash...

722
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,800
Alright, alright.

723
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,800
As a mop, you have a side.

724
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,800
But he's just a working guy.

725
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,800
He's normal.

726
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,800
He's mopping there.

727
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,800
Mercy, are you afraid of clowns?

728
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,800
Not really, because Serenity...

729
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
Bestie.

730
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,800
Serenity is quite fond of clowns.

731
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,800
She finds them quite delightful.

732
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,800
Her words, not mine.

733
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,800
Her words, not mine.

734
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,800
Can someone shut the fuck up?

735
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,800
Mods!

736
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,800
Get him out of here.

737
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,800
Oh, I did it!

738
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,800
Wait, what's that? What's that?

739
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
Mr. Kane's so material possession

740
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,800
since the death of his brother.

741
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,800
Sorry, you were after me.

742
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,800
Wait, is this Mr. Kane?

743
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,800
He has a book, right? Where's the book?

744
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,800
I'm trying to find his book!

745
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
Wait, I got the book?

746
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,800
Oh, I do have the book.

747
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,800
Oh shit, I'm like, super injured.

748
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,800
Oh, back to the library!

749
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,800
I'd like to be healed soon.

750
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,800
Where's the library?

751
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,800
We're hella injured, though.

752
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
So I have your book.

753
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,800
It took a lot out of me.

754
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,800
Ah, you've returned the book I see.

755
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,800
Thank you, young man.

756
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,800
Feel free to look around the library

757
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,800
for anything that interests you.

758
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,800
You told me you'd help me get to the third floor.

759
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,800
Ah, yes.

760
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,800
You'll need a special key

761
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,800
to present the keeping of our resident chess master.

762
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,800
Here is your clue.

763
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,800
Along with the positions of his pieces,

764
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
the chess master holds the key

765
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
to the third level.

766
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,800
Always in his thoughts.

767
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,800
That's the clue?

768
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,800
The best that I can give you.

769
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,800
I'll write it down for you

770
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,800
so that you won't forget.

771
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800
If you don't find this key,

772
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,800
I'm afraid you'll never make it any further.

773
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
Good luck.

774
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,800
I think...

775
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,800
I already got it.

776
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
I think...

777
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
I think...

778
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,800
I already got it.

779
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
My bad.

780
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,800
Did we even need to fight Mr. Cain?

781
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
He was attacking me.

782
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
He was attacking me,

783
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,800
so I was kind of like,

784
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
um, okay.

785
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
Does the key work now?

786
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
I don't know.

787
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,800
I could have shielded.

788
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,800
I need to get a Cupid doll?

789
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,800
It's like...

790
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
It's like, uh, without helping me,

791
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,800
you won't get past anywhere,

792
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,800
and I'm like...

793
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,800
Okay, but I accidentally did the key.

794
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,800
No client meant that we need to fight him

795
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,800
in order to advance. I don't know.

796
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,800
Can I?

797
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,800
I'm looking...

798
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,800
This is a...

799
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,800
You don't...

800
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,800
I...

801
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,800
Well...

802
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,800
How...

803
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,800
If she...

804
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,800
And...

805
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
I'll give you a clue as...

806
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,800
How will...

807
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,800
Oh, you'll know it.

808
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,800
I can't believe we did...

809
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,800
the quest on Pier Accent.

810
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,800
Thank you for the two.

811
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,800
I have no idea what's absolutely going on, Kohai.

812
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,800
Sometimes...

813
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,800
Sometimes, Senpai,

814
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
if we don't know what's going on...

815
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,800
We...

816
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,800
We kind of do something...

817
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,800
Like...

818
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,800
Would you like a hint for something later?

819
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,800
Maybe.

820
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,800
Maybe.

821
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,800
You like...

822
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,800
You like that was a troll,

823
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,800
because I found it on my own.

824
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,800
I feel like that was a troll,

825
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,800
because I found the key on my own.

826
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,800
I don't know what the key is for.

827
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,800
I kind of killed him!

828
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,800
That was my bad.

829
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,800
There's something in the chestmaster room?

830
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,800
It could be.

831
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,800
I'll go check again.

832
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,800
I don't know what's going on.

833
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,800
I don't know what's going on.

834
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
I don't know what's going on.

835
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,800
I don't know what's going on.

836
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,800
I don't know what's going on.

837
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
I'll go check again.

838
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,800
I am so severely injured, though.

839
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,800
A gift from Bobby Fisher

840
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,800
when he got to lock his door one night.

841
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
Anything else in this grotesque head of his?

842
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,800
Nope.

843
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,800
Sorry, I kind of killed him.

844
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,800
Yeah, I kind of killed him, you know?

845
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,800
Just happened.

846
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,800
He was attacking me.

847
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,800
I had to attack back.

848
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,800
You know, stuff like that.

849
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,800
He and the ashtrays?

850
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,800
I already got some bullets.

851
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:04,800
What's this?

852
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,800
What's this?

853
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,800
Yes, okay.

854
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,800
Thank you for writing it down for me.

855
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,800
I think the only place we didn't check was past the janitor.

856
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,800
I don't want to kill the janitor, though!

857
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,800
I really don't want to kill the janitor.

858
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,800
Like, for real, I don't want to kill the janitor.

859
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,800
I think we're going to have to spill some blood.

860
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,800
I'm going to have to kill him?

861
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,800
You think just because I'm a janitor I got no pride?

862
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,800
That's all I got to do all day is clean up after your rich bastards?

863
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,800
Take a hike before you get hurt!

864
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,800
Take a hike!

865
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,800
Not the New Yorkan.

866
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,800
One save.

867
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,800
I'm so sad.

868
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,800
He's just working.

869
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,800
Okay, wait.

870
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,800
Did I not type it out?

871
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,800
Oh, wait.

872
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,800
He's just...

873
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,800
working.

874
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,800
Janitor just...

875
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,800
What?

876
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,800
Alright, buddy.

877
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,800
You asked for it.

878
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,800
Asked?

879
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,800
What?

880
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,800
You have a...

881
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,800
You have a stink word on?

882
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,800
I thought you!

883
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,800
Was that a steeper gun?

884
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,800
Was that a nail gun?

885
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,800
Or a stapler gun?

886
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,800
Now he's got a moth-able over again!

887
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Let's see.

888
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,800
He's got a moth-able over again.

889
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,800
Now he's gonna mop the lover again!

890
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,800
He's got a gun! Does that mean I need to use a gun?

891
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,800
Shepard!

892
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,800
Thanks for the 5, Charlie.

893
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,800
Oh, I thought you were experienced at this murder thing.

894
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,800
I want to avoid it if I can. You understand?

895
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:37,800
Alright, buddy. You act for it!

896
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
What do you mean, alright?!

897
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:51,800
What do you mean, alright?! Why did it continue on?!

898
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,800
Why did it continue on?!

899
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,800
Why did it continue on?!

900
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,800
I don't understand.

901
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,800
He's just doing his job!

902
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,800
I can't.

903
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,800
Oh, it's like this game's janky. Yeah, a little bit.

904
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:37,800
How old is this game? 1998?

905
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,800
It's from 1998.

906
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,800
Good night, Kohai.

907
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,800
Okay, good night.

908
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,800
Okay, well, 1996, never mind.

909
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,800
It's an even number. 1996, actually.

910
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,800
Actually.

911
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,800
Alright, buddy.

912
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,800
Wait! I forgot to equip it!

913
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,800
Oh, that deduction, I...

914
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,800
I forgot to equip it!

915
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,800
I forgot to get strapped!

916
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,800
Alright, buddy. You act for it!

917
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,800
Alright.

918
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,800
Can I get the...

919
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,800
Oh my gosh, I have no health left.

920
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
I have no health left.

921
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,800
He's just a working...

922
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,800
Something's on the floor?

923
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,800
It's his broom.

924
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,800
I don't think there's anything else.

925
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,800
Is there?

926
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,800
Just me...

927
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,800
and him.

928
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,800
Save in a different slot.

929
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,800
Oops.

930
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,800
No, I mean, I think there's something at your feet.

931
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,800
Yeah.

932
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,800
Like this thing?

933
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,800
Yeah, it's just me.

934
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,800
It's just me.

935
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,800
Is there anything else?

936
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,800
The door is locked, is this...?

937
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,800
Oh my god, is this where I have to do...?

938
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,800
Well, that didn't work. Well, that didn't work.

939
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,800
Really?

940
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,800
Wait! No, it worked!

941
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,800
What the heck?

942
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,800
Man!

943
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,800
I thought...

944
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:06,800
So that's what you all meant by clowns.

945
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,800
Hahaha!

946
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,800
I am literally living on a single pixel.

947
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,800
How am I going to do this, Senpai?

948
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,800
Senpai, how am I going to do this?

949
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:41,800
Do I backtrack to the Gumball machine? Can I do that?

950
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,800
I'm going to see if I can do that, too.

951
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,800
Give me the gum!

952
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,800
Wait, no, that's where I needed to go.

953
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,800
Where's the gum?

954
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,800
I don't know.

955
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
I don't know.

956
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,800
Wait, no, that's where I needed to go.

957
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,800
We're all out of Gumballs, but maybe there's some left?

958
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,800
I would try killing him with this knife.

959
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,800
I accidently clicked the wrong thing!

960
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,800
Yeah, let's...

961
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,800
Arm the Scythe instead. That was my bad.

962
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,800
It works!

963
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,800
Oops.

964
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,800
Maybe put the gun down for now.

965
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,800
My bad, I was a little excited.

966
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:00,800
Dessert! Now go ahead and have an ammo count.

967
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,800
Okay, I can't go back down. We're freaking screwed.

968
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,800
We're freaking screwed.

969
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,800
Oh my gosh, we're screwed.

970
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,800
Dude.

971
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,800
Do I go... Do I just wail?

972
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,800
Try a little bit of save to get the ammo back. I can do that.

973
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,800
Am I going to need all the ammo?

974
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,800
Grabbing the chainsaw, you add it to your inventory, hoping it will come in handy.

975
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,800
You also find a cuppy doll and something that looks like a key.

976
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,800
Oh, that was easier than I thought.

977
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,800
I literally thought...

978
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,800
There.

979
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,800
I thought I was going to die.

980
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,800
I thought I was going to die.

981
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,800
I thought I was going to die.

982
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,800
Here.

983
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,800
Don't say this cake is half-eaten.

984
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,800
Say this cake is splattered with brain matter.

985
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,800
Either way, don't eat it.

986
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,800
I need my help back, hello!

987
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,800
Then it goes more than just pop.

988
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,800
Over here.

989
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,800
Brown stains on the outside of the jackbox.

990
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,800
You don't want to want what's packed inside to come spraying out.

991
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,800
Let's play Impale the Poor, Dumb, Halfless Animal of Mondarts.

992
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,800
Rejector is broken, so you're unable to screen the film,

993
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,800
which happens to be the light, holiday, children's classic,

994
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,800
monkey boy goes ape shit with a chainsaw.

995
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,800
Soul.

996
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:07,800
A blood splattered movie screen, or are you back in the art gallery again?

997
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,800
Is he okay?

998
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,800
I asked after, like, I kill him.

999
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,800
Tank of happy gas.

1000
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
It's plum empty.

1001
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
I guess that said, huh?

1002
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,800
Perhaps a clue as to why this birthday wasn't very happy.

1003
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,800
Anything else in here?

1004
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,800
It should be fine.

1005
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,800
That was my bad.

1006
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,800
I have a key.

1007
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,800
Hopefully it opens the door.

1008
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,800
Yeah.

1009
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,800
Yeah.

1010
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,800
It is a QP, like the male QP.

1011
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,800
QP key.

1012
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,800
Let's save in another thing.

1013
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,800
QP.

1014
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,800
Did you know that they make vegan mayo?

1015
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,800
I've never tried it, but apparently they do.

1016
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,800
Why am I sneaking like this?

1017
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,800
Why is the flag so like this?

1018
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,800
Flag full.

1019
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,800
What the heck is this?

1020
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,800
A wooden plank.

1021
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,800
A wooden plank.

1022
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,800
I have a staircase leading nowhere.

1023
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,800
Non-functional prop kitchen.

1024
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,800
Range rider lunchbox, or with feed bag accessory.

1025
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,800
Grab a sandwich out of the lunchbox and put it away for like,

1026
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,800
I need that, I need that now.

1027
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,800
Uh.

1028
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,800
The burp always makes it better.

1029
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,800
Hammer.

1030
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,800
Can I take the hammer?

1031
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,800
Hammer.

1032
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,800
Hammer, which craftsmen use to work their magic.

1033
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,800
Non-functional prop.

1034
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,800
Anything else?

1035
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,800
No.

1036
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,800
Wooden plank. Well, I have free planks now.

1037
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,800
Essential theoretical equipment costumes.

1038
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,800
A chair which has been rigged to break into pieces

1039
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,800
during the hilarious third act.

1040
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,800
Scene of the lodge's rap musical hit,

1041
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,800
Mr. Smith's trip to Turkey.

1042
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,800
Two masks hanging on the wall.

1043
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,800
Turn that frown upside down.

1044
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,800
It has to be a hint, right?

1045
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,800
Top street slump circa 1890,

1046
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:55,800
evocative of the time when America was free of concepts

1047
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,800
like, what is race?

1048
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,800
Ah!

1049
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,800
An empty water cool.

1050
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,800
Ah!

1051
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,800
What is this alien, the cancer?

1052
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:26,800
Compliment, Terry Coffin nails.

1053
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,800
Thanks.

1054
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,800
Have another, dear.

1055
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,800
Standard seat-tie fire extinguisher.

1056
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,800
Damn it.

1057
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,800
Wait, what did I get?

1058
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,800
Wait, what did I get? What was that?

1059
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,800
Lighter fluid.

1060
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,800
Case, great. Is this?

1061
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,800
Oh, are these cigarettes?

1062
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,800
Anything else I need in here?

1063
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,800
Well.

1064
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,800
Coffin nails is a nickname for cigarettes.

1065
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,800
Thank you.

1066
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,800
Where are these?

1067
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:36,800
Do these do anything? Did I get a hint for them yet?

1068
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,800
Back on the stage, you can steal the flags. I can steal the flags?

1069
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,800
I like stealing.

1070
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,800
Well, that didn't work.

1071
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,800
What do you mean that didn't work? Thanks.

1072
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,800
Is it even a puzzle?

1073
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,800
Cole hides a stealer in all these games, yes.

1074
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,800
He takes the entire poll.

1075
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,800
What do these do?

1076
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,800
They're masking like a puzzle.

1077
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,800
Unless it's one of those things, you know, Senpai?

1078
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,800
One of those things that...

1079
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,800
that, like, they're fake puzzles.

1080
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,800
I don't trust this game anymore.

1081
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,800
Is this a fake puzzle?

1082
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,800
Like, is this a fake puzzle?

1083
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,800
What?

1084
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,800
What?

1085
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,800
What was that?

1086
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,800
Okay.

1087
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,800
Wait, I saw something.

1088
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,800
The hand.

1089
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,800
Laundry.

1090
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,800
Red blood water swirls behind the glass.

1091
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,800
Anything around here?

1092
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,800
Wait.

1093
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,800
I think the mask can was, like, streamlined.

1094
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,800
What was the hint then?

1095
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,800
I can't remember what the hint was.

1096
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,800
Is there anything around here?

1097
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,800
Am I missing something?

1098
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,800
I swear I saw a hand.

1099
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,800
So I could pick something up.

1100
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,800
Was I trippin'?

1101
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,800
Was I trippin'?

1102
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,800
I was probably trippin'.

1103
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,800
It's like Stephanie's clothes.

1104
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,800
These cabinet things?

1105
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,800
Alright.

1106
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,800
Okay.

1107
01:44:54,800 --> 01:45:07,800
Cut off. This cutoff valve is rusted and won't budge.

1108
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:12,800
So I have something for it?

1109
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:18,800
How do you do that?

1110
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:24,800
Why save?

1111
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,800
Auga!

1112
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,800
Oh, no.

1113
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,800
Auga!

1114
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,800
Hmm?

1115
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,800
These both good pipe.

1116
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,800
I French.

1117
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,800
Thank you.

1118
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,800
Wait.

1119
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,800
I don't know.

1120
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,800
I don't know.

1121
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,800
I don't know.

1122
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,800
I don't know.

1123
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,800
I don't know.

1124
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,800
I don't know.

1125
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,800
I don't know.

1126
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,800
I don't know.

1127
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,800
I'll go back here.

1128
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,800
I got to use

1129
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,800
the pipe went on it.

1130
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,800
Pipe went!

1131
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,800
Eh?

1132
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,800
Didn't work?

1133
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,800
Oh what?

1134
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,800
The Ranch didn't help much.

1135
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,800
The valve is stuck solid.

1136
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,800
Okay.

1137
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:29,800
another pipe thing? well that didn't work. damn it! how do you mean? I just want it to

1138
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:44,800
the curved pipe. our meters, skews locks, um, doors lock. okay. it might be a puzzle here.

1139
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:53,800
oh! can I put the pipe here? well that didn't work.

1140
01:46:53,800 --> 01:47:11,800
um. oh man. well that didn't work. can I staple it? well that didn't work. wait there's a valve up there. oh!

1141
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:20,800
can I put the pipe there now? damn it!

1142
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:49,800
the dial is moving?

1143
01:47:51,800 --> 01:48:00,800
is it a staple gun? well that didn't work. uh.

1144
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:12,800
uh.

1145
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:41,800
oh! I was on a timer. well what was I supposed to do? it's hard to notice but there was an unfinished pipe in the middle top.

1146
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:53,800
huh?

1147
01:48:53,800 --> 01:49:09,800
I thought I used it on the broken pipe.

1148
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:23,800
I have these two right?

1149
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:38,800
wait. the broken pipe. this one? well that didn't work. oh! okay. hold on. um.

1150
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:53,800
well that didn't work. damn it! well that didn't work. oh man. well that didn't work.

1151
01:49:53,800 --> 01:50:01,800
yay!

1152
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:09,800
got it! I did it!

1153
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:20,800
should I save? probably save.

1154
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:30,800
once I saw it actually got off I was like oh it's a really long pipe so we'll just connect the pipes.

1155
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,800
wait why are you here?

1156
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:49,800
roll! turbine screams and a high-pitched whine.

1157
01:50:49,800 --> 01:51:01,800
what's all this then? um. flesh nubble? well that didn't work. oh man. okay.

1158
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:19,800
oh! hold on. oh man. I'm not gonna. quick quick quick. ah! the door! ah!

1159
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:25,800
remains of a less fortunate initiate.

1160
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:31,800
gonna save again. I can't save.

1161
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:40,800
standby!

1162
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,800
wait!

1163
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,800
high-pitched whine.

1164
01:51:51,800 --> 01:52:07,800
wait! standby!

1165
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:15,800
help!

1166
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:27,800
what do you mean wrong order?

1167
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:38,800
what do you mean?

1168
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:43,800
what do you mean wrong order?

1169
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,800
what do you mean wrong order?

1170
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:56,800
what do you mean wrong order?

1171
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,800
what do you mean wrong order?

1172
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:08,800
what do you mean wrong order?

1173
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:19,800
what do you mean wrong order?

1174
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:27,800
one. two. well that didn't work.

1175
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:36,800
is that better?

1176
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:40,800
still going.

1177
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:47,800
does that mean I lose?

1178
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:55,800
never mind it's fine. wait!

1179
01:53:55,800 --> 01:54:03,800
oh!

1180
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:10,800
rope to level three.

1181
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:20,800
there anything else here senpai?

1182
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,800
pack of nails.

1183
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:33,800
door is locked from the other side. anything else here?

1184
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:42,800
this is the temple of the mystery of abstinence. do not eat of the food or you will be punished. all within are hereby bound to a vow of abstinence.

1185
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:47,800
of eating?

1186
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,800
this is the temple of the mystery.

1187
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:58,800
okay. door is locked. door is locked.

1188
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,800
oh he's just eating right?

1189
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:14,800
you obey well initiate. better than your brethren. they have eaten and grown stronger for it. as promised I will not punish you for your obedience. but they will.

1190
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:25,800
who? wait!

1191
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:28,800
bergi gone!

1192
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,800
what the hell man?

1193
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:36,800
you obey well initiate.

1194
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:42,800
and some mothers complain that their children don't come to see them.

1195
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:47,800
you're so good!

1196
01:55:47,800 --> 01:56:06,800
shocked? this is the mystery of motherly love. everyone says motherhood is fulfilling when in reality it's draining.

1197
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,800
I see what you mean!

1198
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:14,800
you don't know the half of it.

1199
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:27,800
from the start, children are parasites. that's what you've got to understand. sucking the life out of you.

1200
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:35,800
your very life's blood pumping from your belly through obscene pink tubes into their thieving hearts.

1201
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:41,800
and even after birth, they keep leaching the life from you.

1202
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:46,800
you're so good!

1203
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:57,800
of course, my children are better at it than most. is that the bliss of motherhood? that's the mystery.

1204
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:04,800
just what the world needs. more greedy little mouths to feed. children suck the life out of society.

1205
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:13,800
they have to be protected. nurtured. everything has to be child proof. and rendered childish.

1206
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:24,800
sadly, they'll suck the life out of you too. you too.

1207
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:32,800
these kids are gonna attack me, are they?

1208
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,800
wait no!

1209
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:38,800
back off, kid!

1210
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,800
back off!

1211
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,800
I can take on children!

1212
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:13,800
I can't! I can't!

1213
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:18,800
well, at least the mom saved, yay!

1214
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:23,800
welcome to the temple of the mystery of religion.

1215
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,800
the mystery of religion?

1216
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:28,800
the mystery is the last.

1217
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:40,800
those who preach love and mercy in God's name are often those who call for the death of heathens.

1218
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:43,800
do you believe in God, my son?

1219
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:46,800
mercy mentioned!

1220
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,800
wait, what should I say?

1221
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:54,800
um...

1222
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,800
wait, of course!

1223
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:01,800
yes? or chance?

1224
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:07,800
you are wise. his mercy annoys us all.

1225
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:11,800
and where doth he dwell, the lord?

1226
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:14,800
which, which lord?

1227
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:39,800
which one are you... wait, are those, are those cow ball sacks?

1228
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:50,800
and all of us, but this, but this might be like the opposite, right?

1229
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,800
no, they're otters!

1230
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,800
oops!

1231
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:08,800
indeed, any other response would be blasphemous.

1232
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:13,800
answer me this, if the word be with you.

1233
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:19,800
does the lord bounce on a spring or frolic with the wombats?

1234
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:21,800
I love wombats.

1235
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:23,800
sorry.

1236
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:32,800
yes, the fields of the lord arrive with wombats and he is there shepherd.

1237
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:36,800
answer thus, if thou be virtuous.

1238
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:48,800
does God Almighty herd them with his staff or with special imported wombat herding equipment?

1239
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:51,800
there's a staff I can take?

1240
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:00,800
but why would all I gotta do on the equipment?

1241
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,800
is there a staff I can take?

1242
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:05,800
did I save?

1243
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:18,800
oh, I can't save.

1244
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:30,800
but he says I'll take the staff, does that mean I'll get an item?

1245
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,800
does that mean I just get the item?

1246
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,800
oh no, I love wombats.

1247
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:43,800
but then what, it means an item, right?

1248
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:52,800
naturally, God, being Almighty, hath no need to import anything, his staff doth serve.

1249
02:01:52,800 --> 02:02:01,800
now, I ask thee one final question, which is only known to those amongst the ranks of the saved.

1250
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:02,800
the saved?

1251
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:19,800
is God a jar of strawberry preserves, a size 12 sneaker, a foot long hoagie, an all expense paid trip to Brazil, or a new car?

1252
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,800
a what?

1253
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,800
a new car?

1254
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,800
Bugatti.

1255
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,800
a new car, everyone wants the new car.

1256
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,800
is there an actual answer?

1257
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:45,800
we're going to Brazil?

1258
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,800
Brazil.

1259
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,800
you think there's an actual answer?

1260
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:59,800
to Brazil sounds better.

1261
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:06,800
okay, well, okay, car or Brazil?

1262
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,800
Brazil mentioned, Brazil.

1263
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,800
okay, fine, Brazil.

1264
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,800
you are correct.

1265
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:15,800
pass in peace, brother.

1266
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:19,800
the Lord is with thee.

1267
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:24,800
wait, was that a correct answer or were all of them correct answers?

1268
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,800
I'm going to save just in case.

1269
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:35,800
I was like, Brazil.

1270
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:48,800
I didn't get a staff.

1271
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,800
are you guys okay?

1272
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:54,800
the rotting remains of two children.

1273
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,800
a nicely frayed middle of honor.

1274
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:01,800
that's empty.

1275
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:04,800
ashes of a campfire.

1276
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:09,800
oh, come on, it's locked.

1277
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:19,800
well, that didn't work.

1278
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:23,800
you eat the whole thing and you feel refreshed.

1279
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:34,800
you fill up your chainsaw with gas.

1280
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:41,800
wait, is there more?

1281
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:45,800
oh, wait, there's like an exit here.

1282
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:47,800
what do you want here?

1283
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:50,800
I'm just passing through.

1284
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,800
you think it's that simple, huh?

1285
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:56,800
just passing through when my family was just sitting around

1286
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:59,800
and look where it got them.

1287
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:01,800
you killed your family?

1288
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:04,800
wait, what is this?

1289
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:07,800
wait, what's your...

1290
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:10,800
the temple of the mystery of morality.

1291
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:11,800
what?

1292
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,800
my country paid me to kill.

1293
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,800
and then when I came home, I was out of a job.

1294
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:19,800
they expected me to stop.

1295
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,800
cold turkey, is that what they wanted?

1296
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:24,800
a paycheck today, jail sale tomorrow?

1297
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:28,800
am I a criminal or an entrepreneur?

1298
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,800
let's find out.

1299
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,800
wait, what?

1300
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:34,800
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1301
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,800
back off, back off, back off!

1302
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:47,800
So what was the answer?

1303
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:59,600
It's a nice lamb.

1304
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:04,400
Welcome to the temple of the mystery of flesh, do you have a bite?

1305
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,280
Mr. Potsdam?

1306
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:12,520
The mystery is this, sometimes you have to lose some meat to get some meat.

1307
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:17,120
They wouldn't let me in, until I demonstrated my worthiness.

1308
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:24,760
My invitation came after I buried Karen, the one that showed initiative.

1309
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:27,640
And her spinal cord was your ticket in, right?

1310
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:28,640
What spinal cord?

1311
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:34,000
Yes, but to be initiated into the mysteries of the harvest, I had to do one last thing.

1312
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,500
I let them into the house, and into step-

1313
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:44,160
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean her spinal cord?

1314
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:45,920
What did you do?

1315
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:49,000
Sometimes you have to sacrifice meat to gain meat.

1316
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,360
The order taught me that.

1317
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,360
Now I am a butcher.

1318
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,320
You should have gotten your dad to hire me on.

1319
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:03,320
That way, you could have been the boss, instead of the prime cut.

1320
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:09,320
Are those meat hooks?

1321
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:17,320
Back up, backs, be gone meat!

1322
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:22,320
Oh thank goodness.

1323
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:25,320
Which direction Senpai?

1324
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:32,320
Oh wait, never mind, I only have one direction.

1325
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:42,320
Hello handsome, looking for a good time at a reasonable price?

1326
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:45,320
Oh?

1327
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:48,320
Oh?

1328
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,320
Oh?

1329
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:55,320
Cool, hi protectors!

1330
02:07:55,320 --> 02:08:02,320
But I'm also like, you know?

1331
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:18,320
One?

1332
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:20,320
We should be strong, should we?

1333
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,320
They're not old, right?

1334
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,320
Okay, you know what, hold on, let me check.

1335
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:28,320
We're married!

1336
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:32,320
But the game said, okay fine.

1337
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:38,320
No, the only girl you have is me.

1338
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:41,320
Scorn mixed with desire, that's our lot.

1339
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:43,320
Such is the mystery of lust.

1340
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:47,320
So often the instruments of lust, as all instruments of higher pleasure,

1341
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:50,320
are condemned as frequently as they are sought after.

1342
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:54,320
I'd go on about the hypocrisy of a hydrophobic society,

1343
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:59,320
but I think I'd rather just kill me a man.

1344
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:01,320
Please!

1345
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:03,320
Please!

1346
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:09,320
I'm sorry!

1347
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:11,320
I didn't mean to, my bad.

1348
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:17,320
Fair enough, we kill him.

1349
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:43,320
Pale white and glistening.

1350
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:49,320
Are you a werewolf?

1351
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:51,320
So, Senpai, what do you say?

1352
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:55,320
This is a test.

1353
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:58,320
What?

1354
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:00,320
You're not that hot, get over here!

1355
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,320
Tuts!

1356
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:07,320
You bastard!

1357
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:15,320
Okay, sorry.

1358
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:17,320
Oh, there's two exits!

1359
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:27,320
Which one should I choose, left or right?

1360
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:33,320
Left, okay.

1361
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:38,320
Welcome, initiate, to the temple of the mystery of pain.

1362
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:44,320
The mystery is thus, the simple manipulation of nerves may break one man,

1363
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:47,320
and yet leave another unmoved.

1364
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:49,320
The physiology is the same.

1365
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:53,320
All nerves sing alike, yet the results differ.

1366
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:57,320
The question can only be answered by paradox.

1367
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:01,320
Although the body functions according to the tenets of science,

1368
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:04,320
the invocation of pain is an art.

1369
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:09,320
My implements are simple things, like a painter's brushes,

1370
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:12,320
from which beautiful complexities spring,

1371
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:16,320
different stories brought forth from different canvases,

1372
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:18,320
with a different application.

1373
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:22,320
What's my health at? I can't check.

1374
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:26,320
I invite you now to torture this man on the table,

1375
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,320
to explore this blessed mystery.

1376
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:31,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, I have a whippy thingy.

1377
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:35,320
I'll have to teach you the lesson, myself.

1378
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:37,320
Hold on, I got a thing.

1379
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:43,320
My health is good, my health is good.

1380
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:47,320
Oh man, okay.

1381
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:50,320
Wait, what?

1382
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,320
Damn it.

1383
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:58,320
Oh, I don't get to do anything. What do I do then?

1384
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:02,320
Okay.

1385
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:06,320
It's a range mark vaccine.

1386
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:10,320
Thanks.

1387
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:20,320
What am I supposed to-

1388
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:25,320
Am I- Do I have a choice?

1389
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:32,320
Teaching pain?

1390
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,320
I thought I could just use this.

1391
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,320
Oh man.

1392
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:44,320
Wait, maybe that's the pigeon?

1393
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:48,320
Okay, well, it's not working, so...

1394
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:54,320
Never mind, that's...

1395
02:12:54,320 --> 02:13:00,320
No?

1396
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:07,320
Do I just ignore him?

1397
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:10,320
Oh, it's not working anyway.

1398
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:20,320
I think you're at a range. I am?

1399
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:28,320
No?

1400
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:32,320
No?

1401
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:42,320
Locked down a bit?

1402
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:53,320
Oh!

1403
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:58,320
Wait, no, get back here. Get back here.

1404
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:09,320
Wait, why is it having a hard time?

1405
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:20,320
Wait, why is it having a hard time?

1406
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:35,320
Lock it. Just in case.

1407
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:39,320
How do I get up more?

1408
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:45,320
I attacked the rope, dude!

1409
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:56,320
Get in the way!

1410
02:14:56,320 --> 02:15:04,320
Go around? How do I go around?

1411
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:09,320
Come on!

1412
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:20,320
No way! Am I stuck?

1413
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,320
Maybe a bullet will reach him?

1414
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:28,320
Sure.

1415
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:33,320
Oh no.

1416
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:37,320
Some pie. Some pie, I broke the game.

1417
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:43,320
Some pie, I broke... No, we're fine.

1418
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:45,320
Oh, cool!

1419
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:50,320
Okay, bye!

1420
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:54,320
I am not killing a blind person!

1421
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:56,320
Well, up into the temple of the mystery of charity.

1422
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:57,320
Oh, it's him again!

1423
02:15:57,320 --> 02:16:00,320
What mystery is there in charity, for God's sake?

1424
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:03,320
The mystery is thus.

1425
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:07,320
Any act of charity is an act of selfishness.

1426
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:11,320
For in any charitable exchange, one must take from another,

1427
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:18,320
and one is always left the poorer.

1428
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:20,320
Oh, the giver is not poorer.

1429
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:22,320
He receives a great feeling from giving.

1430
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,320
A feeling?

1431
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:26,320
Discouraging answer initiate.

1432
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:31,320
You see, though I am needy, I do not consider myself a beggar

1433
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:33,320
so much as a taker.

1434
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:36,320
I require charity initiate.

1435
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:41,320
Give me something.

1436
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:45,320
I don't have anything?

1437
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:47,320
Charity is a loathsome lie.

1438
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:52,320
The only gift that keeps on giving is death.

1439
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:54,320
Okay.

1440
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:56,320
Well, get over here!

1441
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:05,320
Wait, he's quite tough!

1442
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:09,320
I didn't expect him to be tough.

1443
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:12,320
This system, as part of your initiation,

1444
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:15,320
will be required to execute charity.

1445
02:17:15,320 --> 02:17:18,320
That's how old people are disposed of to lodge,

1446
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:23,320
and each member is expected to be shared.

1447
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:31,320
Okay.

1448
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:35,320
Julius Caesar!

1449
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:38,320
Okay, it should be pretty easy.

1450
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:50,320
Wait, kill Caesar.

1451
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:53,320
Should I kill the old people, or Caesar?

1452
02:17:53,320 --> 02:18:00,320
He's got a sword.

1453
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:04,320
There can only be one, Caesar?

1454
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:08,320
I'm seeing more twos than ones.

1455
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:12,320
You have a gun.

1456
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:16,320
I didn't equip it.

1457
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:19,320
I'm seeing more two than one.

1458
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:22,320
Okay, well, should be pretty easy.

1459
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:25,320
I'm retiring death will advance yourself.

1460
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:27,320
Hold.

1461
02:18:27,320 --> 02:18:29,320
They're begging you for mercy.

1462
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:30,320
Wait, what?

1463
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:36,320
Do you grant it?

1464
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:44,320
Wait, should I grant it?

1465
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:50,320
No, no, wow, you are all cruel, cruel people.

1466
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:53,320
They've finished their initiation.

1467
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:56,320
The last is the mystery of mercy.

1468
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:58,320
Mystery of mercy, that's me!

1469
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:01,320
And mercy of perversion of the natural order.

1470
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:02,320
Wait!

1471
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,320
When you extend mercy to a competitor.

1472
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,320
Extending me?

1473
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:12,320
You give him a second chance to be tea.

1474
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:19,320
Hold on, let me save.

1475
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:25,320
Mercy of perversion.

1476
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:28,320
Mercy mentioned, right?

1477
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:35,320
I am the mystery!

1478
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:37,320
Oh, I should kill Caesar.

1479
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:44,320
Can I do it with a gun?

1480
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:53,320
I accidentally killed the old man.

1481
02:19:53,320 --> 02:19:57,320
I accidentally killed the old man.

1482
02:19:57,320 --> 02:20:05,320
I'm sorry, I just, I just, I just, I, I started whaling.

1483
02:20:05,320 --> 02:20:10,320
I just started whaling.

1484
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:29,320
You know, I just started blasting.

1485
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:36,320
I'm sorry, I was too, you know, sometimes you get a little excited and then you, you

1486
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:48,320
don't realize your own strength.

1487
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:51,320
Oh my gosh, I'm so close to death though.

1488
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:59,320
Can I move over here just a little bit?

1489
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:08,320
Oh, an ancient sword.

1490
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:18,320
So left or right?

1491
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:19,320
Wait, down to my last thing?

1492
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:24,320
Is that bad?

1493
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:38,320
Man, okay.

1494
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:39,320
I still have the Neo gun.

1495
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:40,320
Wait, was that bad?

1496
02:21:40,320 --> 02:21:41,320
Should I have started over?

1497
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:43,320
Should I just hit him with the side?

1498
02:21:43,320 --> 02:21:44,320
Got a new sword.

1499
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:49,320
Yeah.

1500
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:53,320
I want to save the ammo for what's coming up!

1501
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:57,320
I got to kill the old people again then, dang.

1502
02:21:57,320 --> 02:22:02,320
Hold on, I'll stick, hold on, I'll do it again, I'll do it again Senpai.

1503
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:15,320
I'll do it again.

1504
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:25,320
Never mind.

1505
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:26,320
He hit me!

1506
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:30,320
He just hit me with one!

1507
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:43,320
I'm sorry, I might have to kill the seniors.

1508
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:53,320
Maybe the Neo gun on him?

1509
02:22:53,320 --> 02:23:03,320
Okay, it worked!

1510
02:23:03,320 --> 02:23:07,320
Oh man.

1511
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:10,320
I can't believe that worked!

1512
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:13,320
So did I finish the old people off too?

1513
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:15,320
Now I have a cool sword!

1514
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:25,320
Oh well.

1515
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:32,320
Oh God!

1516
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:34,320
What the hell?

1517
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:41,320
What the hell?

1518
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:50,320
What the hell?

1519
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:58,320
What the hell?

1520
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:13,320
What the hell?

1521
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:14,320
What?

1522
02:24:14,320 --> 02:24:19,320
It's happening!

1523
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:21,320
That was so fast!

1524
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:34,320
What's happening Senpai?

1525
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:36,320
Do I need a quick draw?

1526
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:39,320
Oh my gosh, okay, maybe I got to do it.

1527
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:44,320
Can we kill the guy on the thing?

1528
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:47,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1529
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:51,320
All right, let's go!

1530
02:24:51,320 --> 02:24:53,320
That's enough!

1531
02:24:53,320 --> 02:25:13,320
That's it!

1532
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:17,320
Kill the main dude first?

1533
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:18,320
I did!

1534
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:21,320
Did you not see it?

1535
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:33,320
Is this actually a timing like a western duel?

1536
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:38,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1537
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:44,320
All right, let's go!

1538
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:46,320
Jesus!

1539
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:48,320
Jesus!

1540
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:53,320
Jesus!

1541
02:25:53,320 --> 02:26:02,320
He's so fast!

1542
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:07,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1543
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:11,320
All right, let's go!

1544
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:13,320
What's your name?

1545
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:29,320
How bad is my health?

1546
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:31,320
Well at least I got him that time!

1547
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:33,320
How did...

1548
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:34,320
He tanked it!

1549
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:38,320
How many?

1550
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:44,320
Just leave the room?

1551
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:46,320
Door is locked!

1552
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:47,320
Door locked!

1553
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:52,320
Door locked!

1554
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:10,320
Cool, I can get all the way to the other room?

1555
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:12,320
There's more to come.

1556
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:17,320
What's your name, hungry?

1557
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:19,320
Steve's a swell name.

1558
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:38,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1559
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:40,320
Jesus!

1560
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:43,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1561
02:27:43,320 --> 02:27:44,320
Jesus!

1562
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:47,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1563
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:48,320
Jesus!

1564
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:50,320
Oh my gosh, never mind!

1565
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:54,320
That position is terrible!

1566
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:57,320
I just get behind him.

1567
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:04,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1568
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:08,320
All right, let's go!

1569
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:11,320
What's your name, hungry?

1570
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:37,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1571
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:38,320
Jesus!

1572
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:41,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1573
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:42,320
Jesus!

1574
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:45,320
Stay tuned for rules and there's more to come.

1575
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:53,320
He is so fast!

1576
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:58,320
Seems the further the better, probably!

1577
02:28:58,320 --> 02:29:00,320
He is so fast!

1578
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:07,320
Well, time to get for the shotgun.

1579
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:56,320
Oh no, Senpai! Oh no, Senpai! Oh no, I don't have! I don't have enough ammo!

1580
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:17,320
I don't have enough ammo! Maybe we should have conserved the shells.

1581
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:34,320
Senpai!

1582
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:07,320
I gotta ski down to the water and hold him back for the gun.

1583
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:11,320
It's the- the thingy!

1584
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:16,320
Ah, fuck.

1585
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:23,320
I only have four nails. Even though I have all these nails.

1586
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:36,320
Am I stuck? I don't want to be stuck.

1587
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:41,320
Sort or anything faster than your sight.

1588
02:31:41,320 --> 02:32:02,320
Well, let's see real quick.

1589
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:14,320
Well, it took longer.

1590
02:32:14,320 --> 02:32:20,320
I didn't think it would work. Okay, hold on.

1591
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:28,320
First, how many? First, how many people?

1592
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:56,320
Oh, fuck.

1593
02:32:56,320 --> 02:33:25,320
Yeah, the static on that one kinda hurt, right, Senpai?

1594
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:34,320
Okay.

1595
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:40,320
I don't know how many enemies there are, Senpai.

1596
02:33:55,320 --> 02:34:24,320
That guy died. That guy died, so that means it was possible. I was too close.

1597
02:34:25,320 --> 02:34:35,320
But I was too close! That means I need four nails!

1598
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:43,320
Four nails! And at least a bonk. Yeah, wait until he's actually shootable.

1599
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:35,320
They have to be this far.

1600
02:35:54,320 --> 02:36:04,320
We did it!

1601
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:14,320
Whoa!

1602
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:24,320
Wait, you're the principal!

1603
02:36:24,320 --> 02:36:39,320
Muckety Muck?

1604
02:36:39,320 --> 02:37:06,320
What do you mean? You'll have to kill me to find out what he means, big guy.

1605
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:10,320
Senpai.

1606
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:17,320
The guide recommends shotgun for this guy!

1607
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:48,320
No, we're not going back. I don't think I can melee the robot though.

1608
02:37:48,320 --> 02:38:00,320
We advise you to conserve the ammo. Don't blame us. I really wanted that sword.

1609
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:07,320
How far back did I save, Senpai?

1610
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:24,320
How far back did I save before that?

1611
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:34,320
How far back did I save before that?

1612
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:44,320
Oh my gosh.

1613
02:38:44,320 --> 02:38:57,320
My best bet is the sword now, huh?

1614
02:38:57,320 --> 02:39:08,320
Here was definitely worse than this. I healed up a little bit.

1615
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:13,320
We're better! The heal!

1616
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:20,320
Again.

1617
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:23,320
Healed.

1618
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:29,320
The sword's ready.

1619
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:34,320
Welcome to the Inner Sanctum, big guy.

1620
02:39:34,320 --> 02:39:47,320
Within the Inner Sanctum, you will address me as Vice Muck Harrow, second in command to the Grand Muckety Muck, he of the Pheasant Buffalo Helm, the Secret Handshake, the Funny Passwords.

1621
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:55,320
Only fitting, given that my role has always been that of an educator and harvest is one big classroom.

1622
02:39:55,320 --> 02:39:56,320
What do you mean?

1623
02:39:56,320 --> 02:40:03,320
You'll have to kill me to find out what he means, big guy.

1624
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:06,320
Wait, why am I in here again?

1625
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:32,320
Wait, why am I injured again? What happened to the vaccine?

1626
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:35,320
What happened?

1627
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:43,320
Steve's a swell name. My dog's name is Steve. Would you like my autograph, Steve? Here you go then.

1628
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:46,320
I'm just Range Rider the Cowboy.

1629
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:49,320
Welcome to the Inner Principle.

1630
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:50,320
Within the Inner...

1631
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:51,320
What do you mean?

1632
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:53,320
You'll have to kill...

1633
02:41:06,320 --> 02:41:09,320
I almost did it.

1634
02:41:09,320 --> 02:41:16,320
It looks like I almost did it.

1635
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:20,320
It's so very possible.

1636
02:41:20,320 --> 02:41:26,320
Okay, let's look at the animal box, okay.

1637
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:29,320
Okay.

1638
02:41:29,320 --> 02:41:30,320
I was thinking I was...

1639
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:31,320
Damn it.

1640
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:32,320
Put the nails in there.

1641
02:41:32,320 --> 02:41:33,320
Okay.

1642
02:41:39,320 --> 02:41:41,320
Is there a way to open them?

1643
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:49,320
No, I think they're just items that I already put in the thing.

1644
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:51,320
The box here, see?

1645
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:53,320
Well, that didn't work.

1646
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:54,320
Nothing.

1647
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:01,320
That...

1648
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:05,320
I can put the nails...

1649
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:07,320
No, it won't work.

1650
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:12,320
Try the chainsaw then.

1651
02:42:20,320 --> 02:42:22,320
We can try.

1652
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:48,320
I think it might be too short.

1653
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:51,320
What do you think, Senpai?

1654
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:57,320
I think it might be too short.

1655
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,320
Hmm.

1656
02:43:05,320 --> 02:43:18,320
The TV station blew up before.

1657
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:21,320
That was then, and this is now.

1658
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:23,320
We could use a pool stick or something.

1659
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:25,320
Not happening.

1660
02:43:32,320 --> 02:43:34,320
Welcome to the Inner Principle.

1661
02:43:35,320 --> 02:43:36,320
With any...

1662
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:37,320
What do you...

1663
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:39,320
You'll have to kill me to fight.

1664
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:42,320
Shit.

1665
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:07,320
Wait, I did not quit anything yet.

1666
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:15,320
I did it!

1667
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:26,320
I'm a gamer!

1668
02:44:35,320 --> 02:44:36,320
Stephanie?

1669
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:45,320
A cupidall?

1670
02:44:58,320 --> 02:44:59,320
Enough games.

1671
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:00,320
Enough games.

1672
02:45:04,320 --> 02:45:05,320
Hit.

1673
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:31,320
I don't hurt all the ones I love.

1674
02:45:32,320 --> 02:45:33,320
You fool!

1675
02:45:33,320 --> 02:45:35,320
I thought she was making me for a second.

1676
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:37,320
I'm fine.

1677
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:38,320
We're fine.

1678
02:46:02,320 --> 02:46:03,320
Wait.

1679
02:46:11,320 --> 02:46:12,320
The Sim?

1680
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:28,320
Sam?

1681
02:46:29,320 --> 02:46:30,320
Sam?

1682
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:40,320
This is nothing more than a virtual reality designed by the harvesters to test potential members.

1683
02:46:40,320 --> 02:46:49,320
Having successfully completed the program, you have earned the right to become a harvester.

1684
02:46:49,320 --> 02:46:51,320
A harvester?

1685
02:46:53,320 --> 02:46:54,320
What the hell is a harvester?

1686
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:56,320
Yeah, what the hell is a harvester?

1687
02:46:57,320 --> 02:47:01,320
The hand that grips the knife that stabs...

1688
02:47:01,320 --> 02:47:03,320
The hand that grips the knife that stabs...

1689
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:13,320
You're talking about people?

1690
02:47:13,320 --> 02:47:14,320
Killing people.

1691
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:21,320
The title dropped!

1692
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:30,320
Wait, the Sim is for serial killers?

1693
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:55,320
You want me to become a serial killer?

1694
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:57,320
You want me to become a serial killer?

1695
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:06,320
Sorry, this is such a scam.

1696
02:48:07,320 --> 02:48:10,320
And like, games make killers?

1697
02:48:25,320 --> 02:48:28,320
The construct known as harvest.

1698
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:33,320
What is the real world at this point?

1699
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:36,320
What is the real world?

1700
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:44,320
Right now, you are suspended in a sensory deprivation tank, wired to a VR tech.

1701
02:48:44,320 --> 02:48:51,320
If you don't join us, we will terminate your life support and you will be dead within minutes.

1702
02:48:51,320 --> 02:48:57,320
Those last minutes, however, will seem like a lifetime lived in harvest.

1703
02:48:57,320 --> 02:49:03,320
You will marry Stephanie, and die peacefully of old age.

1704
02:49:03,320 --> 02:49:04,320
Okay.

1705
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:08,320
You're presuming a what?

1706
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:12,320
Aside from you.

1707
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:20,320
She is the only real person in harvest, suspended in a tank.

1708
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:23,320
Jacked in just as you are.

1709
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:27,320
I assume you'll want to spend time together.

1710
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:31,320
Wait, she's also jacked in too?

1711
02:49:33,320 --> 02:49:35,320
Of course.

1712
02:49:35,320 --> 02:49:45,320
Having completed your ordeal, you may leave with her as you intend it and enjoy your victory.

1713
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:56,320
If, on the other hand, you wish to join us, the cost of exiting the lodge is the same as the cost of entering the lodge.

1714
02:49:56,320 --> 02:50:00,320
A skull and spinal cord.

1715
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:05,320
Oh, we...

1716
02:50:08,320 --> 02:50:09,320
No.

1717
02:50:09,320 --> 02:50:10,320
No.

1718
02:50:11,320 --> 02:50:13,320
You couldn't kill me.

1719
02:50:14,320 --> 02:50:21,320
These harvesters, they put people through this torture to give them a taste for killing.

1720
02:50:21,320 --> 02:50:24,320
The way to beat them is to deny them.

1721
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:26,320
To live out your life here.

1722
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:29,320
With me.

1723
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:33,320
You're thinking about killing me, aren't you?

1724
02:50:33,320 --> 02:50:35,320
Didn't you hear what he said?

1725
02:50:35,320 --> 02:50:37,320
I do exist.

1726
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:39,320
If you kill me here, I'll die for real.

1727
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:45,320
And I'll feel all the pain, all the terror, because I'm real.

1728
02:50:45,320 --> 02:50:52,320
Well, after all, what's a murder without pain and terror?

1729
02:50:52,320 --> 02:51:00,320
We will feed the pain impulses directly into our brain and then pull the plug.

1730
02:51:00,320 --> 02:51:04,320
You will be a murderer this time for real.

1731
02:51:05,320 --> 02:51:07,320
So what will it be?

1732
02:51:07,320 --> 02:51:09,320
Life in harvest?

1733
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:12,320
Or life as a harvester?

1734
02:51:15,320 --> 02:51:18,320
Choose now.

1735
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:20,320
Senpai!

1736
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:27,320
What I choose?

1737
02:51:27,320 --> 02:51:30,320
Do we live in harvest and peace?

1738
02:51:30,320 --> 02:51:34,320
It's a few seconds, but it feels like a lifetime.

1739
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:36,320
Or do we kill?

1740
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:39,320
Do we kill?

1741
02:51:39,320 --> 02:51:41,320
Kill!

1742
02:51:41,320 --> 02:51:43,320
Oh, you want to become a harvester?

1743
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:45,320
Okay.

1744
02:51:46,320 --> 02:51:49,320
Peace was never an option to become a harvester.

1745
02:51:49,320 --> 02:51:51,320
I think we should kill.

1746
02:51:51,320 --> 02:51:53,320
Everyone said kill.

1747
02:51:53,320 --> 02:51:54,320
Let's kill.

1748
02:51:54,320 --> 02:51:56,320
Okay.

1749
02:51:56,320 --> 02:51:58,320
Let's kill.

1750
02:51:58,320 --> 02:52:00,320
For the title drop.

1751
02:52:00,320 --> 02:52:02,320
See if you can.

1752
02:52:02,320 --> 02:52:04,320
Oh, I can't say.

1753
02:52:06,320 --> 02:52:09,320
Can we do a scum?

1754
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:25,320
Now I can do both.

1755
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:26,320
Okay.

1756
02:52:26,320 --> 02:52:28,320
Time to kill.

1757
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:33,320
You disappoint me.

1758
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:34,320
Wait.

1759
02:52:34,320 --> 02:52:36,320
You had possibilities.

1760
02:52:38,320 --> 02:52:40,320
Did I choose the wrong one?

1761
02:52:40,320 --> 02:52:42,320
Become as twisted as you.

1762
02:52:42,320 --> 02:52:44,320
Wait, I chose the wrong one?

1763
02:52:44,320 --> 02:52:47,320
You've made your choice and succeeded in...

1764
02:52:47,320 --> 02:52:49,320
I chose the wrong one!

1765
02:52:49,320 --> 02:52:51,320
Enjoy the life you've chosen.

1766
02:52:51,320 --> 02:52:54,320
Such as it is.

1767
02:52:57,320 --> 02:53:00,320
Oh, we get to do both, right?

1768
02:53:01,320 --> 02:53:03,320
Look, they're all married.

1769
02:53:03,320 --> 02:53:06,320
Just like how...

1770
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:09,320
Just like how we'll be.

1771
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:18,320
Oh, we got a pipey.

1772
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:21,320
An arm all right.

1773
02:53:27,320 --> 02:53:30,320
Oh, that's us dying.

1774
02:53:30,320 --> 02:53:32,320
What a waste.

1775
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:34,320
This kid could have been something.

1776
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:36,320
Never look back.

1777
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:38,320
We got two more to plug in.

1778
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:41,320
There's got to be a better way to develop the serial killer.

1779
02:53:41,320 --> 02:53:43,320
This is scientific.

1780
02:53:43,320 --> 02:53:45,320
You want us to go back to the old way?

1781
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:47,320
What old way?

1782
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:49,320
Good breeding.

1783
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:51,320
You want us to go back to the old way?

1784
02:53:51,320 --> 02:53:53,320
What old way?

1785
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:55,320
Good breeding.

1786
02:54:06,320 --> 02:54:08,320
Good...

1787
02:54:08,320 --> 02:54:10,320
Wow.

1788
02:54:10,320 --> 02:54:12,320
That's some commentary.

1789
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:14,320
They're doing science.

1790
02:54:16,320 --> 02:54:18,320
We still die anyway.

1791
02:54:18,320 --> 02:54:20,320
But if we choose to live a life in harvest,

1792
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:23,320
we grow old and...

1793
02:54:23,320 --> 02:54:25,320
Like, it feels like a lifetime,

1794
02:54:25,320 --> 02:54:27,320
but we only live a few seconds.

1795
02:54:31,320 --> 02:54:33,320
And then the other one,

1796
02:54:33,320 --> 02:54:35,320
we become a serial killer.

1797
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:38,320
John Johns, what a name.

1798
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:42,320
Oh, look at all these.

1799
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:44,320
They have so many people.

1800
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:46,320
Wait, Cupid?

1801
02:54:46,320 --> 02:54:48,320
The Cupid was all...

1802
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:50,320
Was all... was an actor?

1803
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:52,320
I'm sorry.

1804
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:54,320
I thought it was the other hand.

1805
02:54:54,320 --> 02:54:56,320
Let's go.

1806
02:54:56,320 --> 02:54:58,320
Please help me.

1807
02:54:58,320 --> 02:55:00,320
I want to go back to the old way.

1808
02:55:00,320 --> 02:55:02,320
I want to go back...

1809
02:55:02,320 --> 02:55:04,320
I want to go back to the old way.

1810
02:55:04,320 --> 02:55:06,320
But if we choose to live a life in harvest,

1811
02:55:06,320 --> 02:55:08,320
we grow old and...

1812
02:55:08,320 --> 02:55:10,320
We grow old and...

1813
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:12,320
We grow old and...

1814
02:55:12,320 --> 02:55:14,320
We grow old and...

1815
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:16,320
We grow old and...

1816
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:18,320
We grow old and...

1817
02:55:18,320 --> 02:55:20,320
Please help me!

1818
02:55:20,320 --> 02:55:22,320
Dave, don't do this, please!

1819
02:55:22,320 --> 02:55:24,320
No!

1820
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:26,320
No! Please! Somebody help me!

1821
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:28,320
No!

1822
02:55:28,320 --> 02:55:30,320
Oh, am I supposed to do it?

1823
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:32,320
Sorry!

1824
02:55:36,320 --> 02:55:38,320
How many times are we going to do this?

1825
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:44,320
There we go.

1826
02:55:44,320 --> 02:55:46,320
Whoa!

1827
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:48,320
Wait, is that Mortal Kombat?

1828
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:52,320
What's the reference to Mortal Kombat?

1829
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:58,320
Wow, that was neat.

1830
02:56:02,320 --> 02:56:04,320
Welcome to our order, brother.

1831
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:06,320
Brother.

1832
02:56:16,320 --> 02:56:18,320
Where are you going?

1833
02:56:18,320 --> 02:56:20,320
Nowhere.

1834
02:56:26,320 --> 02:56:28,320
Nowhere at all.

1835
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:48,320
What are you doing, son?

1836
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:50,320
Playing Harvester.

1837
02:56:50,320 --> 02:56:52,320
That thing?

1838
02:56:52,320 --> 02:56:54,320
I looked at it the other day.

1839
02:56:54,320 --> 02:56:56,320
The very thought.

1840
02:56:56,320 --> 02:56:58,320
Breeding serial killers.

1841
02:56:58,320 --> 02:57:00,320
It's disgusting.

1842
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:02,320
It's cool.

1843
02:57:02,320 --> 02:57:04,320
You'll rot your mind playing games like that.

1844
02:57:04,320 --> 02:57:06,320
Don't you know people who watch violence

1845
02:57:06,320 --> 02:57:08,320
become violent themselves?

1846
02:57:08,320 --> 02:57:10,320
No.

1847
02:57:10,320 --> 02:57:12,320
No.

1848
02:57:12,320 --> 02:57:14,320
No.

1849
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:16,320
That's bullshit, Mom.

1850
02:57:16,320 --> 02:57:18,320
No it isn't.

1851
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:20,320
Why do you think they started cutting the violence

1852
02:57:20,320 --> 02:57:22,320
out of those Roadrunner cartoons?

1853
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:24,320
Roadrunner cartoons.

1854
02:57:24,320 --> 02:57:26,320
Roadrunner cartoons.

1855
02:57:26,320 --> 02:57:28,320
Roadrunner cartoons.

1856
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:30,320
Roadrunner cartoons.

1857
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:32,320
Roadrunner cartoons.

1858
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:34,320
Roadrunner cartoons.

1859
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:43,320
Eww, eww, are we gonna be pooped out? Eww.

1860
02:57:50,320 --> 02:57:52,320
Oh, you ate the finger?

1861
02:57:55,320 --> 02:57:58,320
The agenda was so subtle, it was crazy.

1862
02:57:58,320 --> 02:58:00,320
He ate the finger.

1863
02:58:05,320 --> 02:58:10,320
Why did he eat the ring?

1864
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:12,320
Rocks taste good.

1865
02:58:16,320 --> 02:58:18,320
Yubi Yubi!

1866
02:58:19,320 --> 02:58:22,320
Which one was the good ending, Senpai?

1867
02:58:22,320 --> 02:58:24,320
I don't know what you think.

1868
02:58:34,320 --> 02:58:43,320
It seems like it was a little longer, so I feel like that ending was like considered like the true ending.

1869
02:58:54,320 --> 02:58:58,320
Now, Senpai, look.

1870
02:58:59,320 --> 02:59:05,320
We can finally quit it!

1871
02:59:09,320 --> 02:59:12,320
Yay!

1872
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:15,320
We're free!

1873
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:19,320
Congratulations, everyone.

1874
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:25,320
We have finished playing one whole game together.

1875
02:59:25,320 --> 02:59:27,320
How's it feel?

1876
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:30,320
Hahaha.

1877
02:59:34,320 --> 02:59:37,320
Which ending did you like the most, Senpai?

1878
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:40,320
Hahaha.

1879
02:59:40,320 --> 02:59:44,320
I can't believe I actually beat the game.

1880
02:59:44,320 --> 02:59:48,320
The last two fights were so hard.

1881
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:55,320
I feel like, I feel like, we...

1882
02:59:56,320 --> 03:00:00,320
The success and the ending paying off wasn't great,

1883
03:00:00,320 --> 03:00:06,320
but the fact that we did it together despite beating it,

1884
03:00:06,320 --> 03:00:11,320
despite how hard it was, was...

1885
03:00:11,320 --> 03:00:15,320
at least the last two bosses being how hard they were,

1886
03:00:15,320 --> 03:00:19,320
I feel like that itself is an accomplishment.

1887
03:00:19,320 --> 03:00:22,320
Hahaha.

1888
03:00:23,320 --> 03:00:29,320
The last ending was cool, the one where we become the harvester.

1889
03:00:29,320 --> 03:00:32,320
Hahaha.

1890
03:00:32,320 --> 03:00:38,320
I guess that makes sense because everything was a little wacky in harvest, right?

1891
03:00:38,320 --> 03:00:45,320
So in the end, it turns out, and why there are some people that look the same.

1892
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:52,320
Yeah.

1893
03:00:52,320 --> 03:00:57,320
I think winning the fights and just fighting everyone was pretty fun.

1894
03:00:57,320 --> 03:00:59,320
It was pretty fun.

1895
03:00:59,320 --> 03:01:01,320
Why were they creating serial killers, though?

1896
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:03,320
We're fun, of course!

1897
03:01:03,320 --> 03:01:05,320
Hahaha.

1898
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:13,320
It was definitely really wacky, but I feel like,

1899
03:01:13,320 --> 03:01:18,320
I think I love point-and-click games.

1900
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:26,320
I love point-and-click games, so...

1901
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:30,320
the fact that we managed to complete at least one game felt really good.

1902
03:01:30,320 --> 03:01:32,320
Felt pretty good, especially together.

1903
03:01:32,320 --> 03:01:38,320
I hope we can finish more games together as well.

1904
03:01:39,320 --> 03:01:41,320
How did I feel about it?

1905
03:01:41,320 --> 03:01:43,320
I feel like...

1906
03:01:43,320 --> 03:01:46,320
I can feel the age in it.

1907
03:01:48,320 --> 03:01:51,320
I can feel the age in it.

1908
03:01:51,320 --> 03:01:54,320
Like, the fact that when I loaded the game, it was like,

1909
03:01:54,320 --> 03:01:59,320
oh, don't forget to insert the second disc!

1910
03:02:06,320 --> 03:02:10,320
And some points were impossible to do.

1911
03:02:10,320 --> 03:02:18,320
Like, we're supposed to torture the man strapped to the table, right?

1912
03:02:27,320 --> 03:02:30,320
That was kind of impossible to go.

1913
03:02:33,320 --> 03:02:35,320
Alt-F4 to continue.

1914
03:02:35,320 --> 03:02:39,320
I can't believe I was like, this is the only time I'm ever going to do Alt-F4.

1915
03:02:41,320 --> 03:02:43,320
To actually continue a game.

1916
03:02:44,320 --> 03:02:48,320
Alright, isometric games like Shadowrun on the table, Kohai.

1917
03:02:48,320 --> 03:02:50,320
Isometric game, Shadowrun?

1918
03:02:50,320 --> 03:02:52,320
Hold on, let me go-go-go.

1919
03:02:55,320 --> 03:02:56,320
Oh, my.

1920
03:02:56,320 --> 03:02:57,320
Okay.

1921
03:02:57,320 --> 03:02:59,320
Shadowrun.

1922
03:02:59,320 --> 03:03:00,320
Run.

1923
03:03:00,320 --> 03:03:02,320
What is this?

1924
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:06,320
Science Fantasy tabletop role-playing game.

1925
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:09,320
Tabotop role-playing game?

1926
03:03:18,320 --> 03:03:19,320
Tabotop?

1927
03:03:24,320 --> 03:03:25,320
Nah, that's fine.

1928
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:27,320
What was the most crazy scene for me?

1929
03:03:29,320 --> 03:03:33,320
It would probably be the last stream I played.

1930
03:03:37,320 --> 03:03:38,320
Played.

1931
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:40,320
What's the word?

1932
03:03:42,320 --> 03:03:48,320
The last harvester stream, where they popped the baby's eye back in.

1933
03:03:48,320 --> 03:03:50,320
That one was like, ugh.

1934
03:03:51,320 --> 03:03:54,320
That's my opinion, that one was ugh.

1935
03:03:54,320 --> 03:03:56,320
The baby, definitely.

1936
03:03:57,320 --> 03:03:59,320
And like the spider coming out, I guess?

1937
03:03:59,320 --> 03:04:01,320
That one was kind of freaky.

1938
03:04:07,320 --> 03:04:10,320
No, wait, not the spider, the wasp egg.

1939
03:04:10,320 --> 03:04:11,320
Yes, yes, yes.

1940
03:04:11,320 --> 03:04:12,320
Yeah, that one.

1941
03:04:13,320 --> 03:04:14,320
Or was it spider?

1942
03:04:14,320 --> 03:04:15,320
I couldn't remember anymore.

1943
03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:17,320
That one was kind of like, ugh.

1944
03:04:20,320 --> 03:04:22,320
Babies are kind of creepy, I don't know.

1945
03:04:22,320 --> 03:04:24,320
I kind of like babies.

1946
03:04:24,320 --> 03:04:27,320
And then they reach an age where you're like, ugh.

1947
03:04:28,320 --> 03:04:30,320
You're no longer young and cute.

1948
03:04:33,320 --> 03:04:34,320
It was wasp?

1949
03:04:35,320 --> 03:04:36,320
It was wasp?

1950
03:04:36,320 --> 03:04:37,320
Okay, yeah, that one.

1951
03:04:37,320 --> 03:04:39,320
That one was kind of freaky.

1952
03:04:41,320 --> 03:04:44,320
You feel like a serial killer now that you're jacked out?

1953
03:04:45,320 --> 03:04:47,320
Never stopped.

1954
03:04:48,320 --> 03:04:50,320
I mean what?

1955
03:05:04,320 --> 03:05:09,320
I'm such a kidder, Senpai.

1956
03:05:09,320 --> 03:05:11,320
I was always such a kidder.

1957
03:05:18,320 --> 03:05:22,320
Hey, Kohe, what was the last game you completely finished off stream?

1958
03:05:26,320 --> 03:05:27,320
Off stream.

1959
03:05:35,320 --> 03:05:39,320
To be honest, every single game I play have been like streaming.

1960
03:05:39,320 --> 03:05:41,320
There is no off stream.

1961
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:48,320
There is no off stream, Senpai.

1962
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:58,320
The last game I can remember playing

1963
03:05:59,320 --> 03:06:03,320
off stream was I the Somnium Files.

1964
03:06:03,320 --> 03:06:06,320
The first one, probably.

1965
03:06:06,320 --> 03:06:10,320
That was before I started streaming,

1966
03:06:10,320 --> 03:06:13,320
which was over three years ago.

1967
03:06:17,320 --> 03:06:19,320
So yeah, probably.

1968
03:06:21,320 --> 03:06:23,320
Yeah, it was probably I the Somnium Files.

1969
03:06:23,320 --> 03:06:26,320
I just played that thing all the way through.

1970
03:06:26,320 --> 03:06:29,320
And then when the sequel came out, I streamed that one too, yeah.

1971
03:06:37,320 --> 03:06:39,320
The next point-and-click game.

1972
03:06:39,320 --> 03:06:45,320
I'm not sure if I have a point-and-click game in mind right now.

1973
03:06:46,320 --> 03:06:51,320
Maybe Call of Cthulhu Shadow of a Comet.

1974
03:06:52,320 --> 03:06:55,320
Maybe it's Shadow of a Comet that I might consider.

1975
03:06:57,320 --> 03:06:59,320
Because I haven't played that one yet.

1976
03:07:03,320 --> 03:07:05,320
Was it called Shadow of a Comet?

1977
03:07:05,320 --> 03:07:06,320
Hold on.

1978
03:07:17,320 --> 03:07:20,320
Yeah, it was Shadow of the Comet.

1979
03:07:20,320 --> 03:07:25,320
Sorry, Shadow of the Comet is the one that I was thinking about streaming next.

1980
03:07:26,320 --> 03:07:35,320
Because that one, I played the second game,

1981
03:07:35,320 --> 03:07:39,320
Prisoner of Ice, before I did Shadow of a Comet.

1982
03:07:39,320 --> 03:07:43,320
And I feel like I should return to-I should play Shadow of a Comet

1983
03:07:45,320 --> 03:07:51,320
to just kind of tie in Prisoner of Ice before.

1984
03:07:51,320 --> 03:07:57,320
Yeah, I've already, but Senpais would have to play Prisoner of Ice

1985
03:07:57,320 --> 03:08:01,320
off-stream, because I've already played it.

1986
03:08:04,320 --> 03:08:05,320
That one.

1987
03:08:05,320 --> 03:08:09,320
So that one's probably something I'm considering.

1988
03:08:09,320 --> 03:08:12,320
I really like older games, so yeah.

1989
03:08:16,320 --> 03:08:19,320
That's probably definitely like homework.

1990
03:08:21,320 --> 03:08:24,320
I was expecting Dark Seed, but Call of Cthulhu is good too.

1991
03:08:27,320 --> 03:08:29,320
Dark Seed, huh?

1992
03:08:36,320 --> 03:08:39,320
Is this the art from what's-his-name?

1993
03:08:40,320 --> 03:08:44,320
HR, HR Geiger?

1994
03:08:44,320 --> 03:08:46,320
Geiger? Is this Geiger?

1995
03:08:52,320 --> 03:08:54,320
Yeah, I know, I know Geiger's art.

1996
03:08:58,320 --> 03:09:00,320
You know what?

1997
03:09:00,320 --> 03:09:03,320
This looks really-this looks really good, actually.

1998
03:09:03,320 --> 03:09:05,320
I'll put this on the list.

1999
03:09:06,320 --> 03:09:08,320
Dark Seed and Dark Seed 2 are terrible.

2000
03:09:08,320 --> 03:09:10,320
I don't care.

2001
03:09:10,320 --> 03:09:13,320
The artwork looks pretty good, not gonna lie.

2002
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:15,320
This looks pretty good.

2003
03:09:17,320 --> 03:09:19,320
I think it looks pretty good.

2004
03:09:19,320 --> 03:09:21,320
It looks...

2005
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:27,320
Even if plot-wise, it sucks.

2006
03:09:27,320 --> 03:09:30,320
Game-wise, well, if it sucks, it sucks, right?

2007
03:09:30,320 --> 03:09:35,320
But I don't know, I might just play it to look at the art, you know?

2008
03:09:38,320 --> 03:09:43,320
And besides, even if the game sucks,

2009
03:09:43,320 --> 03:09:45,320
and...

2010
03:09:47,320 --> 03:09:49,320
I will...

2011
03:09:50,320 --> 03:09:55,320
I will probably try to make it as entertaining as I can for some-wise.

2012
03:09:56,320 --> 03:09:59,320
Honestly, the next game, oh!

2013
03:10:00,320 --> 03:10:05,320
Thank you, Kendra, for...

2014
03:10:05,320 --> 03:10:07,320
becoming a member!

2015
03:10:07,320 --> 03:10:09,320
Snippin' a monster!

2016
03:10:10,320 --> 03:10:12,320
Um...

2017
03:10:12,320 --> 03:10:14,320
Actually, Senpai,

2018
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:19,320
my retro tink that I've ordered is coming in soon.

2019
03:10:21,320 --> 03:10:23,320
So...

2020
03:10:23,320 --> 03:10:26,320
So I will probably...

2021
03:10:27,320 --> 03:10:31,320
try to play my, like...

2022
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:35,320
console games.

2023
03:10:35,320 --> 03:10:37,320
Ha ha ha ha!

2024
03:10:38,320 --> 03:10:40,320
So...

2025
03:10:40,320 --> 03:10:41,320
Oh, it's so awful.

2026
03:10:41,320 --> 03:10:44,320
Today, I was, like, at home all day, right?

2027
03:10:44,320 --> 03:10:46,320
And then, they said,

2028
03:10:46,320 --> 03:10:48,320
out for delivery!

2029
03:10:48,320 --> 03:10:50,320
And then they said,

2030
03:10:50,320 --> 03:10:53,320
and then I checked, I was checking the, like, thing.

2031
03:10:53,320 --> 03:10:55,320
And it said,

2032
03:10:55,320 --> 03:10:58,320
I attempted to li-delivery, and I said,

2033
03:10:58,320 --> 03:11:00,320
what?

2034
03:11:00,320 --> 03:11:03,320
And Senpai, I have a...

2035
03:11:04,320 --> 03:11:07,320
a, like, a ring camera doorbell.

2036
03:11:07,320 --> 03:11:10,320
And I checked the time

2037
03:11:10,320 --> 03:11:12,320
that they said attempted delivery.

2038
03:11:12,320 --> 03:11:14,320
Nobody was there.

2039
03:11:14,320 --> 03:11:16,320
Nothing.

2040
03:11:16,320 --> 03:11:18,320
No-no one attempted.

2041
03:11:19,320 --> 03:11:20,320
No one, and I was like,

2042
03:11:20,320 --> 03:11:22,320
what do you mean you attempted?

2043
03:11:27,320 --> 03:11:29,320
No one was there!

2044
03:11:30,320 --> 03:11:33,320
So I was hoping I would get it in today

2045
03:11:33,320 --> 03:11:36,320
and start kind of experimenting a little bit.

2046
03:11:36,320 --> 03:11:38,320
But...

2047
03:11:39,320 --> 03:11:41,320
No more info other than that.

2048
03:11:41,320 --> 03:11:43,320
Nope, nothing else.

2049
03:11:43,320 --> 03:11:45,320
They always do that, right?

2050
03:11:45,320 --> 03:11:47,320
There was an attempted attempting.

2051
03:11:54,320 --> 03:11:57,320
So hopefully it comes in tomorrow instead.

2052
03:11:57,320 --> 03:12:01,320
Like, honestly, I hope that tomorrow

2053
03:12:01,320 --> 03:12:03,320
I will get it in,

2054
03:12:03,320 --> 03:12:05,320
and then I can start experimenting with it

2055
03:12:05,320 --> 03:12:07,320
and trying it out.

2056
03:12:07,320 --> 03:12:10,320
I have my TV, my little CRT ready

2057
03:12:10,320 --> 03:12:12,320
to put on my desk as well.

2058
03:12:12,320 --> 03:12:14,320
I'm gonna have to figure out

2059
03:12:14,320 --> 03:12:18,320
how to make the sound go through stream

2060
03:12:18,320 --> 03:12:20,320
instead of through my speakers,

2061
03:12:20,320 --> 03:12:23,320
my TV speakers, because then

2062
03:12:23,320 --> 03:12:25,320
Senpai would be hearing double audio,

2063
03:12:25,320 --> 03:12:28,320
and that would be bad.

2064
03:12:35,320 --> 03:12:37,320
But I think I can do it.

2065
03:12:37,320 --> 03:12:38,320
I think I can do it.

2066
03:12:38,320 --> 03:12:41,320
I just need to consult some of my friends

2067
03:12:41,320 --> 03:12:44,320
and be like, okay, here we go.

2068
03:12:44,320 --> 03:12:47,320
Just crank the TV and we'll listen through your mic.

2069
03:12:47,320 --> 03:12:49,320
Isn't that like...

2070
03:12:49,320 --> 03:12:52,320
I think that would hurt Senpai's ears too much.

2071
03:12:55,320 --> 03:12:59,320
So yeah, I'm looking forward to getting the retro sync.

2072
03:13:04,320 --> 03:13:07,320
But let's check what's on the schedule!

2073
03:13:10,320 --> 03:13:12,320
So tomorrow's my day off!

2074
03:13:12,320 --> 03:13:14,320
Sorry Senpai!

2075
03:13:14,320 --> 03:13:16,320
It's my day off, so...

2076
03:13:17,320 --> 03:13:19,320
I gotta do whatever I want.

2077
03:13:19,320 --> 03:13:21,320
Probably catch up on work.

2078
03:13:22,320 --> 03:13:26,320
Is it truly a day off if I have to catch up on work?

2079
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:39,320
Thursday, we'll be continuing Mario RPG.

2080
03:13:41,320 --> 03:13:43,320
And then on Friday,

2081
03:13:43,320 --> 03:13:47,320
we are continuing our SMT Nocturne members only stream.

2082
03:13:47,320 --> 03:13:53,320
To watch the stream, you must be at a member...

2083
03:13:53,320 --> 03:13:59,320
the members tier for membership.

2084
03:14:01,320 --> 03:14:06,320
And on Saturday,

2085
03:14:06,320 --> 03:14:10,320
I will be playing Takoyaki Party

2086
03:14:10,320 --> 03:14:14,320
with my best friend, Renate Cosmical!

2087
03:14:18,320 --> 03:14:21,320
And that will be my entire week.

2088
03:14:26,320 --> 03:14:29,320
And then after that, Sunday will be my day off,

2089
03:14:29,320 --> 03:14:32,320
which I will probably actually take as a day off.

2090
03:14:32,320 --> 03:14:35,320
Unless I still have work to catch up on.

2091
03:14:35,320 --> 03:14:39,320
In that case, it's not truly a day off.

2092
03:14:40,320 --> 03:14:43,320
I wonder if Serenity would be sad if she knew you killed a clown?

2093
03:14:43,320 --> 03:14:45,320
Don't tell her, okay?

2094
03:14:45,320 --> 03:14:48,320
Oh, if it's an evil clown, she might forgive me.

2095
03:14:49,320 --> 03:14:51,320
Takoyaki Party is a game?

2096
03:14:51,320 --> 03:14:53,320
I thought you were just gonna eat Takoyaki with Serenity.

2097
03:14:53,320 --> 03:14:56,320
We are, unfortunately...

2098
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:09,320
I would have to fly in to actually do a Takoyaki collab with her.

2099
03:15:16,320 --> 03:15:19,320
Because we are besties.

2100
03:15:20,320 --> 03:15:28,320
But unfortunately, Destiny didn't allow us to be besties together together.

2101
03:15:34,320 --> 03:15:35,320
But yeah.

2102
03:15:37,320 --> 03:15:38,320
Destiny.

2103
03:15:38,320 --> 03:15:41,320
I really should get back to Killer 7.

2104
03:15:41,320 --> 03:15:45,320
I should get back to Killer 7, but I haven't had time to...

2105
03:15:46,320 --> 03:15:48,320
I haven't had time to...

2106
03:15:49,320 --> 03:15:50,320
What do you call it?

2107
03:15:51,320 --> 03:15:54,320
To schedule it in yet.

2108
03:15:55,320 --> 03:15:56,320
Because...

2109
03:15:59,320 --> 03:16:01,320
I kind of just wanted to finish Harvester.

2110
03:16:02,320 --> 03:16:07,320
I kind of felt the mood for Mario RPG more this week.

2111
03:16:08,320 --> 03:16:09,320
Senpai!

2112
03:16:09,320 --> 03:16:10,320
Senpai!

2113
03:16:10,320 --> 03:16:12,320
Starting the plane ticket one.

2114
03:16:13,320 --> 03:16:15,320
Thank you, ASI.

2115
03:16:15,320 --> 03:16:16,320
ASI.

2116
03:16:17,320 --> 03:16:20,320
For the 999 Super Chat.

2117
03:16:20,320 --> 03:16:21,320
Thank you so much.

2118
03:16:23,320 --> 03:16:24,320
Don't worry, Kohai.

2119
03:16:24,320 --> 03:16:26,320
We'll get around to it soon.

2120
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:27,320
Thank you.

2121
03:16:27,320 --> 03:16:29,320
Well, well, well, finish.

2122
03:16:29,320 --> 03:16:30,320
I want to finish...

2123
03:16:31,320 --> 03:16:33,320
I want to finish all the games that I play.

2124
03:16:33,320 --> 03:16:38,320
But there are some games where I feel like maybe it's not gonna be great for streams.

2125
03:16:38,320 --> 03:16:42,320
Like, I'll try it out and then not continue it after.

2126
03:16:42,320 --> 03:16:44,320
There might be some games like that, but I...

2127
03:16:44,320 --> 03:16:50,320
I usually, usually, usually strive...

2128
03:16:52,320 --> 03:16:54,320
Usually strive to finish games.

2129
03:16:55,320 --> 03:16:56,320
Usually.

2130
03:16:56,320 --> 03:16:59,320
If a game ends up being too hard, I'm sorry I might not be able to finish it.

2131
03:17:01,320 --> 03:17:02,320
That's...

2132
03:17:02,320 --> 03:17:05,320
That is not because I don't want to finish it.

2133
03:17:05,320 --> 03:17:06,320
It's just because I have...

2134
03:17:06,320 --> 03:17:07,320
I lack the skill level.

2135
03:17:07,320 --> 03:17:11,320
I don't have the dexterity to do it.

2136
03:17:13,320 --> 03:17:14,320
That's it.

2137
03:17:14,320 --> 03:17:15,320
That's me.

2138
03:17:15,320 --> 03:17:17,320
I'm bad at video games.

2139
03:17:21,320 --> 03:17:23,320
Only game you have to finish is Nocturne.

2140
03:17:23,320 --> 03:17:26,320
I most likely will not finish Nocturne.

2141
03:17:27,320 --> 03:17:28,320
Most likely not.

2142
03:17:29,320 --> 03:17:30,320
Because I will...

2143
03:17:30,320 --> 03:17:31,320
I'm...

2144
03:17:31,320 --> 03:17:32,320
It's not you, Senpai.

2145
03:17:32,320 --> 03:17:33,320
It's me.

2146
03:17:33,320 --> 03:17:34,320
It's literally me.

2147
03:17:34,320 --> 03:17:41,320
If I cannot physically beat it, that's probably...

2148
03:17:41,320 --> 03:17:42,320
That's...

2149
03:17:42,320 --> 03:17:44,320
I feel bad, but that's...

2150
03:17:45,320 --> 03:17:46,320
That's gonna be just...

2151
03:17:46,320 --> 03:17:50,320
Just one of the reasons why I drop a game is if it gets too hard.

2152
03:17:56,320 --> 03:17:58,320
I'm not that great of a gamer.

2153
03:18:01,320 --> 03:18:03,320
I'm not that great of a gamer.

2154
03:18:03,320 --> 03:18:05,320
In fact, my gal pals are like,

2155
03:18:05,320 --> 03:18:08,320
You're not ready for souls like sweetie.

2156
03:18:11,320 --> 03:18:14,320
That's what they tell me.

2157
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:15,320
It's like they're like,

2158
03:18:15,320 --> 03:18:16,320
You're not ready.

2159
03:18:28,320 --> 03:18:29,320
It's like oof.

2160
03:18:31,320 --> 03:18:32,320
Yeah, no.

2161
03:18:32,320 --> 03:18:34,320
All the love, but you're really scared.

2162
03:18:34,320 --> 03:18:36,320
Oh no, you all agree.

2163
03:18:36,320 --> 03:18:38,320
It's true though.

2164
03:18:38,320 --> 03:18:40,320
It's probably...

2165
03:18:41,320 --> 03:18:42,320
It's probably true.

2166
03:18:42,320 --> 03:18:45,320
I'm not quite ready for it yet.

2167
03:18:45,320 --> 03:18:46,320
I'm still in my...

2168
03:18:46,320 --> 03:18:48,320
I enjoy my pointing clicks.

2169
03:18:48,320 --> 03:18:51,320
I enjoy my RPG games.

2170
03:18:51,320 --> 03:18:52,320
It's true.

2171
03:19:00,320 --> 03:19:03,320
Cole High is a gamer, just not the gamer.

2172
03:19:03,320 --> 03:19:04,320
It's true.

2173
03:19:05,320 --> 03:19:07,320
Yeah, I wasn't hired for my gaming skills.

2174
03:19:07,320 --> 03:19:08,320
Let's just say that.

2175
03:19:16,320 --> 03:19:20,320
Let's just say I wasn't hired for my gaming skills at all.

2176
03:19:20,320 --> 03:19:22,320
In fact, when I got hired in,

2177
03:19:24,320 --> 03:19:25,320
Strani was like,

2178
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:26,320
I'm sorry sweetie,

2179
03:19:26,320 --> 03:19:28,320
but you have to expand

2180
03:19:30,320 --> 03:19:33,320
your gaming repertoire.

2181
03:19:33,320 --> 03:19:35,320
I don't even remember if she said sweetie or not.

2182
03:19:35,320 --> 03:19:39,320
She said something quite nice, but...

2183
03:19:43,320 --> 03:19:44,320
But...

2184
03:19:46,320 --> 03:19:47,320
It was definitely like a...

2185
03:19:47,320 --> 03:19:49,320
Oh, yeah, I'm not a gamer.

2186
03:19:50,320 --> 03:19:55,320
My gamerness is definitely in puzzle games

2187
03:19:55,320 --> 03:19:57,320
and pointing click games.

2188
03:19:57,320 --> 03:19:59,320
I really love those type of games.

2189
03:19:59,320 --> 03:20:01,320
It's super fun.

2190
03:20:03,320 --> 03:20:05,320
So, out and ring next time now.

2191
03:20:05,320 --> 03:20:06,320
No, no, no.

2192
03:20:06,320 --> 03:20:07,320
I'm sorry.

2193
03:20:07,320 --> 03:20:08,320
I think...

2194
03:20:12,320 --> 03:20:14,320
I think it's...

2195
03:20:16,320 --> 03:20:17,320
What's the word?

2196
03:20:21,320 --> 03:20:23,320
I'm not ready.

2197
03:20:23,320 --> 03:20:24,320
I'm not ready yet.

2198
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:25,320
I'm sorry.

2199
03:20:25,320 --> 03:20:26,320
I'm still not ready.

2200
03:20:27,320 --> 03:20:29,320
I feel like I would not have fun

2201
03:20:29,320 --> 03:20:33,320
with Elden Ring at my current gamer level.

2202
03:20:36,320 --> 03:20:37,320
Nocturne gets pretty hard.

2203
03:20:37,320 --> 03:20:39,320
Yeah, I know Nocturne gets hard,

2204
03:20:39,320 --> 03:20:42,320
but at least Nocturne is like an RPG

2205
03:20:42,320 --> 03:20:44,320
and it's like strategy based

2206
03:20:44,320 --> 03:20:48,320
rather than I'm bad at video games based.

2207
03:20:51,320 --> 03:20:53,320
But, yeah, most...

2208
03:20:53,320 --> 03:20:54,320
You'll see...

2209
03:20:54,320 --> 03:20:58,320
I'll try to expand my gaming genre,

2210
03:20:58,320 --> 03:21:00,320
but you'll see me mostly play...

2211
03:21:00,320 --> 03:21:05,320
My favorite genre is point and click adventure games,

2212
03:21:06,320 --> 03:21:08,320
visual novels...

2213
03:21:11,320 --> 03:21:13,320
Not Fire Emblem, sorry.

2214
03:21:13,320 --> 03:21:15,320
RPGs, JRPGs.

2215
03:21:16,320 --> 03:21:18,320
Minecraft with Imi?

2216
03:21:18,320 --> 03:21:20,320
I don't have Minecraft senpai.

2217
03:21:20,320 --> 03:21:22,320
The only reason why I don't have Minecraft

2218
03:21:22,320 --> 03:21:27,320
is because I tried it out at one of my gal pals place

2219
03:21:27,320 --> 03:21:30,320
when I was sleeping over for Christmas

2220
03:21:30,320 --> 03:21:34,320
and it's really motion sticky.

2221
03:21:38,320 --> 03:21:40,320
Yeah, it's really motion sickness.

2222
03:21:42,320 --> 03:21:43,320
Wild Arms is on my list.

2223
03:21:43,320 --> 03:21:45,320
I want to play it on...

2224
03:21:46,320 --> 03:21:49,320
on PlayStation 2.

2225
03:21:50,320 --> 03:21:51,320
Have you ever played Chrono Trigger?

2226
03:21:51,320 --> 03:21:52,320
A while ago.

2227
03:21:52,320 --> 03:21:55,320
But I've played Chrono Trigger, yes.

2228
03:22:04,320 --> 03:22:06,320
Yeah, the bobbing effect gets pretty bad.

2229
03:22:06,320 --> 03:22:07,320
Oh!

2230
03:22:07,320 --> 03:22:08,320
Oh!

2231
03:22:15,320 --> 03:22:17,320
Oh, welcome Raiders!

2232
03:22:19,320 --> 03:22:21,320
Welcome to the stream!

2233
03:22:24,320 --> 03:22:28,320
Have you considered trying Old School Resident Evil games?

2234
03:22:28,320 --> 03:22:29,320
Um...

2235
03:22:30,320 --> 03:22:33,320
I've watched some speedruns

2236
03:22:33,320 --> 03:22:35,320
of Resident Evil games

2237
03:22:35,320 --> 03:22:40,120
And I think I might actually get really dizzy from the camera changing.

2238
03:22:40,120 --> 03:22:42,820
You know, like how the camera changes the angles all the time?

2239
03:22:42,820 --> 03:22:48,320
I actually get motion sickness from watching that, but that's also a speed run, so I don't know.

2240
03:22:52,120 --> 03:22:57,820
I will not lie to senpai's, I do get motion sickness from even playing Sonic.

2241
03:22:57,820 --> 03:22:59,820
Welcome!

2242
03:22:59,820 --> 03:23:01,820
Welcome Mew!

2243
03:23:01,820 --> 03:23:03,820
Mew! Mew! Mew! Mew!

2244
03:23:03,820 --> 03:23:05,820
Welcome! How are you? How's the-

2245
03:23:05,820 --> 03:23:09,820
What were you doing? Welcome Raiders! Welcome to the stream!

2246
03:23:09,820 --> 03:23:11,820
My name is Mercy Modiste.

2247
03:23:11,820 --> 03:23:17,820
I am from Vialer's Gen 1 in Dodge.

2248
03:23:17,820 --> 03:23:25,820
I am the dorky yandere of my-

2249
03:23:25,820 --> 03:23:29,820
of my company.

2250
03:23:29,820 --> 03:23:31,820
Woohoo! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

2251
03:23:31,820 --> 03:23:33,820
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome in!

2252
03:23:37,820 --> 03:23:47,820
Honestly, honestly, we're just talking about like games that I'm planning to play, and maybe games that I might consider in the future.

2253
03:23:50,820 --> 03:23:54,820
I love games. I love like what's considered like classic.

2254
03:23:55,820 --> 03:23:57,820
Games? I guess?

2255
03:23:59,820 --> 03:24:03,820
A game that you've always wanted to play but never could due to your motion sickness.

2256
03:24:03,820 --> 03:24:05,820
Warframe.

2257
03:24:07,820 --> 03:24:09,820
Warframe, I think-

2258
03:24:11,820 --> 03:24:21,820
I think the like characters you can make are like super cool looking, but uh...

2259
03:24:22,820 --> 03:24:28,820
It's, it's, I-I, well, well, well, well. I like tried, I tried.

2260
03:24:28,820 --> 03:24:36,820
I tried so hard, and I literally threw up like maybe like five minutes into Warframe.

2261
03:24:43,820 --> 03:24:47,820
Like I, I like threw up, threw up.

2262
03:24:47,820 --> 03:24:51,420
They're making soul frame.

2263
03:24:51,420 --> 03:24:53,760
I don't like the soul part in that.

2264
03:25:00,540 --> 03:25:02,100
It's unfortunate though, yeah.

2265
03:25:04,220 --> 03:25:06,220
You like silly point clicks.

2266
03:25:06,220 --> 03:25:07,260
Would you consider Daponia?

2267
03:25:07,260 --> 03:25:08,220
That's only $1 right now.

2268
03:25:08,220 --> 03:25:09,060
I have Daponia.

2269
03:25:09,060 --> 03:25:11,740
I have the entire collection of Daponia.

2270
03:25:11,740 --> 03:25:14,140
I just stopped playing Daponia

2271
03:25:14,140 --> 03:25:16,020
because one of the character reminds me

2272
03:25:16,020 --> 03:25:19,620
of someone I really dislike.

2273
03:25:19,620 --> 03:25:22,100
Like you ever have that moment where you're like,

2274
03:25:22,100 --> 03:25:26,860
this person reminds me of someone and is bothering me.

2275
03:25:31,260 --> 03:25:34,060
So I was the main guy and I was like, oh,

2276
03:25:34,060 --> 03:25:35,700
oh this character reminds me of something.

2277
03:25:35,700 --> 03:25:36,620
It's bothering me.

2278
03:25:36,620 --> 03:25:38,060
It's bothering me.

2279
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:41,140
Which fly out arms game did you wanna play?

2280
03:25:41,140 --> 03:25:41,980
The first one.

2281
03:25:41,980 --> 03:25:44,340
I wanna play the first one or the second one.

2282
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:46,220
Was the first one or the second one better?

2283
03:25:46,220 --> 03:25:47,060
Yeah.

2284
03:25:49,380 --> 03:25:50,220
Not to that level.

2285
03:25:50,220 --> 03:25:53,420
I have the thing where I'm like, ugh, you remind me.

2286
03:25:58,060 --> 03:25:59,780
If you're playing a game that makes you feel that way,

2287
03:25:59,780 --> 03:26:02,220
do you think you'll ever throw up on stream?

2288
03:26:02,220 --> 03:26:04,940
I would probably throw up on stream,

2289
03:26:04,940 --> 03:26:08,380
but when I was on Twitch, that is a banable offense.

2290
03:26:08,380 --> 03:26:12,300
You can, it is against TOS to bar our stream.

2291
03:26:13,300 --> 03:26:18,380
So I've kind of ingrained that into my psyche.

2292
03:26:19,260 --> 03:26:24,260
So, I'm just like, I don't think I wanna,

2293
03:26:25,820 --> 03:26:30,820
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna do that.

2294
03:26:33,700 --> 03:26:35,780
The reason why someone did that,

2295
03:26:35,780 --> 03:26:40,700
they brought it into TOS that is a banable offense

2296
03:26:40,700 --> 03:26:45,300
to throw up on stream was because I think it was

2297
03:26:45,300 --> 03:26:49,300
like some fetish thing that is, that was happening

2298
03:26:49,300 --> 03:26:52,300
and someone was throwing up constantly for money.

2299
03:26:55,740 --> 03:26:57,140
Yeah.

2300
03:26:57,140 --> 03:27:00,060
And they were like also trying to discourage

2301
03:27:00,060 --> 03:27:01,460
like drinking on streams or something.

2302
03:27:01,460 --> 03:27:02,300
I don't know.

2303
03:27:02,300 --> 03:27:06,140
That one, the latter is my theory.

2304
03:27:06,140 --> 03:27:09,820
It's kind of my theory, but the first, the former part

2305
03:27:10,020 --> 03:27:13,420
is like I think someone was like throwing up

2306
03:27:13,420 --> 03:27:16,060
and they were like each time they get like a certain donation

2307
03:27:16,060 --> 03:27:17,620
or something they like threw up.

2308
03:27:18,900 --> 03:27:22,460
So I don't think, I don't think I wanna do that.

2309
03:27:23,500 --> 03:27:27,660
And I definitely, sorry, but that's not

2310
03:27:28,620 --> 03:27:29,980
what I'm gonna cater to.

2311
03:27:31,380 --> 03:27:34,180
Sorry, that's not my kink.

2312
03:27:34,180 --> 03:27:36,020
That's not something I wanna cater to.

2313
03:27:40,100 --> 03:27:40,940
Ugh.

2314
03:27:46,140 --> 03:27:49,340
Yeah, I'm not, I don't wanna throw up on purpose.

2315
03:27:51,340 --> 03:27:53,660
I don't wanna throw up on purpose

2316
03:27:53,660 --> 03:27:57,500
because that is very painful.

2317
03:27:57,500 --> 03:28:00,300
It's very, very painful.

2318
03:28:00,300 --> 03:28:05,300
And it just reminds me of being sick all the time

2319
03:28:06,820 --> 03:28:09,220
because my allergy senpai, okay.

2320
03:28:09,220 --> 03:28:12,220
My allergy is very severe.

2321
03:28:12,220 --> 03:28:17,220
And so I would, when I had my,

2322
03:28:18,460 --> 03:28:23,100
when I ingest eggs at all, I will throw up nonstop.

2323
03:28:23,100 --> 03:28:25,460
I will like keep throwing up everything.

2324
03:28:25,460 --> 03:28:27,900
I will start throwing up everything

2325
03:28:27,900 --> 03:28:29,460
to the point where I have to go to the hospital

2326
03:28:29,460 --> 03:28:31,300
because I won't stop throwing up, right?

2327
03:28:31,300 --> 03:28:36,300
So anything dealing with like barf,

2328
03:28:37,220 --> 03:28:38,620
I know it happens to me a lot.

2329
03:28:38,620 --> 03:28:40,580
It's not something I desire.

2330
03:28:47,860 --> 03:28:50,140
Egg, I hate eggs.

2331
03:28:50,140 --> 03:28:51,380
That's why I really hate eggs.

2332
03:28:51,380 --> 03:28:53,900
I think eggs are disgusting.

2333
03:28:53,900 --> 03:28:55,300
I don't like the shape of eggs.

2334
03:28:55,300 --> 03:28:58,220
I don't like the look of eggs and yolks.

2335
03:28:58,220 --> 03:28:59,460
I don't even like egg gummies

2336
03:28:59,460 --> 03:29:01,460
even though they don't have eggs in them.

2337
03:29:05,580 --> 03:29:07,220
But that's why.

2338
03:29:07,220 --> 03:29:12,220
And that's also, that's also why I don't like porridge

2339
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:17,460
because when I was younger, my parents and the doctors

2340
03:29:17,460 --> 03:29:19,180
did not figure out that I had,

2341
03:29:20,860 --> 03:29:22,700
they didn't figure out I had an allergy.

2342
03:29:22,700 --> 03:29:24,700
So I was sent to the hospital a lot

2343
03:29:24,700 --> 03:29:26,220
and I had to stay overnight a lot.

2344
03:29:26,220 --> 03:29:28,780
And what they would give me was always rice porridge

2345
03:29:28,780 --> 03:29:30,380
or some sort of porridge.

2346
03:29:30,380 --> 03:29:32,020
And that just reminds me of being sick

2347
03:29:32,020 --> 03:29:33,940
and being in the hospital

2348
03:29:33,940 --> 03:29:36,740
and smelling that kind of septic hospital smell.

2349
03:29:36,740 --> 03:29:39,020
It just, it doesn't make me feel good.

2350
03:29:45,740 --> 03:29:46,900
Yeah, and they kept feeding me

2351
03:29:46,900 --> 03:29:47,980
because they thought it was healthy

2352
03:29:47,980 --> 03:29:50,860
and then I would always like eat

2353
03:29:52,540 --> 03:29:53,460
and then throw up.

2354
03:29:56,420 --> 03:29:59,780
Did you learn you had an egg allergies normally?

2355
03:29:59,780 --> 03:30:04,780
No, actually I learned quite late in my childhood,

2356
03:30:05,200 --> 03:30:10,200
meaning I was like 10, 12, maybe 13 or even 14

2357
03:30:13,420 --> 03:30:18,420
when I truly learned that I had an allergy to eggs.

2358
03:30:20,780 --> 03:30:24,380
And that was because the doctor did cross referencing

2359
03:30:24,380 --> 03:30:25,300
at the time.

2360
03:30:25,300 --> 03:30:30,100
So the doctor noticed that I was getting sick

2361
03:30:30,100 --> 03:30:32,260
all the time, like all the time

2362
03:30:32,260 --> 03:30:34,060
that I was throwing up all the time

2363
03:30:34,500 --> 03:30:35,580
nothing was working.

2364
03:30:35,580 --> 03:30:38,020
And they always were like, okay, you've been getting

2365
03:30:38,020 --> 03:30:43,020
quote unquote stomach flus for like your entire life.

2366
03:30:45,900 --> 03:30:49,220
So we're gonna see if it's gonna be an allergy

2367
03:30:49,220 --> 03:30:53,580
and they cross referenced things that made me sick.

2368
03:30:55,460 --> 03:30:58,420
And they found out the one ingredient

2369
03:30:58,420 --> 03:31:00,860
that was like cross was like always

2370
03:31:00,860 --> 03:31:03,440
in everything that I ate was eggs.

2371
03:31:04,260 --> 03:31:09,020
Right, so they did a little test

2372
03:31:09,020 --> 03:31:11,020
and it was indeed eggs.

2373
03:31:11,020 --> 03:31:12,340
And so they were like, okay,

2374
03:31:12,340 --> 03:31:15,860
so this is why ever since you were like a baby,

2375
03:31:15,860 --> 03:31:17,180
you were born with this allergy

2376
03:31:17,180 --> 03:31:18,700
ever since you were a baby,

2377
03:31:20,580 --> 03:31:21,820
you kept on becoming sick

2378
03:31:21,820 --> 03:31:24,540
and you kept on getting hospitalized.

2379
03:31:24,540 --> 03:31:29,180
But now that you know, you can avoid it.

2380
03:31:29,180 --> 03:31:32,740
So now you can live a healthier life.

2381
03:31:35,060 --> 03:31:40,060
So that's how I kind of ended up eating mostly vegan.

2382
03:31:46,220 --> 03:31:51,220
I don't consider myself like a vegan,

2383
03:31:51,820 --> 03:31:56,820
but I'm a vegan when, what's the word?

2384
03:31:59,380 --> 03:32:00,700
When really necessary.

2385
03:32:00,700 --> 03:32:02,700
Cause like if for example, if I go to a restaurant

2386
03:32:02,700 --> 03:32:04,460
and they don't have anything vegan

2387
03:32:04,460 --> 03:32:09,460
and the only thing on the menu that is egg free is a steak,

2388
03:32:10,420 --> 03:32:11,260
I will get the steak.

2389
03:32:11,260 --> 03:32:12,580
You know what I mean?

2390
03:32:17,860 --> 03:32:20,100
Something like, like something like that.

2391
03:32:20,100 --> 03:32:21,740
Like I can't be vegetarian, right?

2392
03:32:27,500 --> 03:32:31,040
The thing is that I cannot do like the micro dosing.

2393
03:32:32,700 --> 03:32:37,700
Um, the micro dosing is cause like even a minuscule amount

2394
03:32:42,860 --> 03:32:46,820
of eggs, which is why I can't even do like cross-contamination

2395
03:32:46,820 --> 03:32:51,620
very well is that I would also get a severe reaction

2396
03:32:51,620 --> 03:32:53,940
to like a very small amount of eggs.

2397
03:32:56,340 --> 03:32:58,300
It's, it's hard.

2398
03:32:58,300 --> 03:33:01,820
I also got sick a lot because some vaccines

2399
03:33:03,380 --> 03:33:08,380
had, had used this egg, egg whites as a carrier

2400
03:33:11,100 --> 03:33:15,220
as a carrier for the vaccine.

2401
03:33:15,220 --> 03:33:17,260
And I would have gotten sick.

2402
03:33:17,260 --> 03:33:22,260
I got sick at that, which I don't, I don't actually regret.

2403
03:33:22,260 --> 03:33:27,260
Um, I don't actually regret getting any of the vaccines

2404
03:33:35,300 --> 03:33:38,100
because, because of my allergy,

2405
03:33:39,660 --> 03:33:44,300
because of my allergy, the doctors were very nice

2406
03:33:44,300 --> 03:33:45,140
and they took care of me.

2407
03:33:45,140 --> 03:33:47,100
So I was able to recover quite well.

2408
03:33:47,100 --> 03:33:49,900
And well, you know, now I'm immune to like a bunch of stuff,

2409
03:33:49,900 --> 03:33:54,900
but, um, it, it sucks.

2410
03:33:56,420 --> 03:33:57,260
It sucks.

2411
03:33:57,260 --> 03:33:58,100
Yeah.

2412
03:33:58,100 --> 03:34:03,100
Admittingly it sucks when, um, when a lot of things you don't

2413
03:34:08,380 --> 03:34:10,020
expect has egg in it.

2414
03:34:10,020 --> 03:34:13,140
So example, cheese, some cheeses will have egg in it

2415
03:34:13,140 --> 03:34:15,500
because I make it a creamier substance.

2416
03:34:15,500 --> 03:34:19,580
Um, a lot of sauces, ice cream, ice cream's always,

2417
03:34:20,180 --> 03:34:23,460
one of the biggest ones that have culprit that has eggs.

2418
03:34:23,460 --> 03:34:27,900
Um, you start finding out things that have eggs in it.

2419
03:34:27,900 --> 03:34:31,660
Like for example, um, like there's certain paints

2420
03:34:31,660 --> 03:34:36,360
that I can't even touch because it contains egg white.

2421
03:34:40,220 --> 03:34:45,220
It's a lot of vigilance, but it's, um, it's avoidable.

2422
03:34:50,500 --> 03:34:52,100
It's avoidable.

2423
03:34:52,100 --> 03:34:53,380
It is avoidable.

2424
03:34:53,380 --> 03:34:58,540
It's not like, you know, it's not like my entire life is ruined

2425
03:34:58,540 --> 03:35:03,060
because, you know, um, you know, it's one thing.

2426
03:35:03,060 --> 03:35:06,460
It's something that's easily avoidable.

2427
03:35:08,820 --> 03:35:12,060
So example, like, you know, McDonald's, McDonald's doesn't

2428
03:35:12,060 --> 03:35:15,500
have, uh, there's some menu items there that don't have eggs,

2429
03:35:15,500 --> 03:35:17,020
right?

2430
03:35:17,020 --> 03:35:24,260
Or like, if I go to like, um, something, something, like,

2431
03:35:24,260 --> 03:35:27,300
you know, any other restaurant, they'll have something

2432
03:35:27,300 --> 03:35:39,060
that would be, would be easy to, um, would be easy to, uh, eat,

2433
03:35:39,060 --> 03:35:40,180
right?

2434
03:35:40,180 --> 03:35:41,220
Some of their sauces have eggs.

2435
03:35:41,220 --> 03:35:43,820
Well, I can avoid the sauces, right?

2436
03:35:43,860 --> 03:35:46,940
So for example, how bad is cross-contamination for you at

2437
03:35:46,940 --> 03:35:47,540
restaurants?

2438
03:35:47,540 --> 03:35:49,620
It's like a 50-50.

2439
03:35:49,620 --> 03:35:56,940
Usually the thing is that if, if like, it doesn't have eggs,

2440
03:35:56,940 --> 03:35:59,860
it's okay.

2441
03:35:59,860 --> 03:36:06,180
But like, if it's something, I'm not going to like die from

2442
03:36:06,180 --> 03:36:07,620
sniffing an egg.

2443
03:36:07,620 --> 03:36:08,540
You know what I'm saying?

2444
03:36:08,540 --> 03:36:12,180
I hate the smell of eggs because it's just how I protect

2445
03:36:12,180 --> 03:36:14,020
myself.

2446
03:36:14,020 --> 03:36:20,340
But like, if, for example, if you wipe down the material, if

2447
03:36:20,340 --> 03:36:24,300
you wipe down the counter, it should be fine.

2448
03:36:24,300 --> 03:36:25,220
It should be fine.

2449
03:36:25,220 --> 03:36:30,060
Like, if you wipe down the, if just wash the, the stuff to

2450
03:36:30,060 --> 03:36:33,820
make it, uh, it's fine, right?

2451
03:36:33,820 --> 03:36:34,860
What about sushi?

2452
03:36:34,860 --> 03:36:37,620
I just don't have Tamagoyaki.

2453
03:36:37,620 --> 03:36:38,860
I can eat sushi.

2454
03:36:43,180 --> 03:36:46,460
Like, if it's washed off, it's fine.

2455
03:36:46,460 --> 03:36:53,900
But if like they, for example, um, let's just say, um, okay,

2456
03:36:53,900 --> 03:36:54,540
here's an example.

2457
03:36:54,540 --> 03:36:55,620
Wendy's.

2458
03:36:55,620 --> 03:37:00,780
Wendy's is a restaurant I can barely eat at.

2459
03:37:00,780 --> 03:37:03,700
The only thing I think I can eat at Wendy's is like a big

2460
03:37:03,700 --> 03:37:04,940
potato.

2461
03:37:04,940 --> 03:37:09,820
The reason why is because they're kind of like egg, egg,

2462
03:37:10,500 --> 03:37:16,260
stuff is grilled in the same area as like the patties as

2463
03:37:16,260 --> 03:37:18,860
well.

2464
03:37:18,860 --> 03:37:26,540
So, so a lot of, and they deep fry, they're like fries in

2465
03:37:26,540 --> 03:37:33,580
like places where they, I think, I think they do like things

2466
03:37:33,580 --> 03:37:34,980
that have egg in them too.

2467
03:37:34,980 --> 03:37:39,260
So, it's a little bit more difficult to eat at, at Wendy's.

2468
03:37:41,660 --> 03:37:45,100
Severe action like block air passage, block air passage,

2469
03:37:45,100 --> 03:37:47,020
throwing up all the time.

2470
03:37:47,020 --> 03:37:51,980
Uh, my face swells up.

2471
03:37:51,980 --> 03:37:54,780
Yeah, kind of thing.

2472
03:37:54,780 --> 03:38:03,420
So, it's, it's kind of like, uh, it's kind of like, uh, that's

2473
03:38:03,420 --> 03:38:09,020
like one place I can't, I can't eat at because, uh, you know,

2474
03:38:09,020 --> 03:38:11,860
I asked the staff, I asked the staff, they're very nice.

2475
03:38:11,860 --> 03:38:13,100
They're usually very nice about it.

2476
03:38:13,100 --> 03:38:13,980
They're like, yeah, okay.

2477
03:38:13,980 --> 03:38:15,020
Uh, yeah, don't eat here.

2478
03:38:15,020 --> 03:38:16,420
And I said, okay, that's fine.

2479
03:38:16,420 --> 03:38:21,060
I don't have to eat here, things like that.

2480
03:38:26,180 --> 03:38:32,260
But, um, yeah, because I'm missing some egg proteins, I do

2481
03:38:32,260 --> 03:38:38,380
get more, I get sick quite easily compared to my friends and my

2482
03:38:38,380 --> 03:38:41,820
family also notices that because I don't eat eggs and because like

2483
03:38:41,820 --> 03:38:47,220
of the protein, certain proteins and eggs that eggs have, I get sick

2484
03:38:47,220 --> 03:38:48,140
a lot more.

2485
03:38:53,980 --> 03:38:59,260
So, yeah, I've learned how to avoid eggs, but sometimes mistakes.

2486
03:39:00,260 --> 03:39:03,260
No eggs is why her hands are so small.

2487
03:39:05,260 --> 03:39:07,260
Funny story, Senpai, one time.

2488
03:39:07,260 --> 03:39:16,260
Um, I remember, uh, someone asked me to be a hand model.

2489
03:39:16,260 --> 03:39:31,260
I asked me to be a hand model because they said my hands were

2490
03:39:31,260 --> 03:39:33,260
like pristine.

2491
03:39:33,260 --> 03:39:46,060
Did you accept, um, no, I didn't accept because when they asked

2492
03:39:46,060 --> 03:39:55,060
me, my parents were convinced that I wanted to become like a surgeon.

2493
03:39:57,060 --> 03:40:01,060
So they were like, no, her hands are going to get like injured and she

2494
03:40:01,060 --> 03:40:03,060
would no longer model kind of thing.

2495
03:40:03,060 --> 03:40:16,060
They were convinced that I would be like a doctor, a surgeon.

2496
03:40:16,060 --> 03:40:24,060
But yeah, my parents were like, no, no, no, she's not going to do that.

2497
03:40:25,060 --> 03:40:33,060
Well, injured, uh, it means like, you know, like I would not like if I do

2498
03:40:33,060 --> 03:40:37,060
like cutting and stuff that I would injure my hand and it could leave

2499
03:40:37,060 --> 03:40:45,060
scars and, uh, and that they didn't want to bring my hopes up or

2500
03:40:45,060 --> 03:40:47,060
something about it.

2501
03:40:48,060 --> 03:40:49,060
Did you even go to school for science?

2502
03:40:49,060 --> 03:40:51,060
No, this was a long time ago.

2503
03:40:55,060 --> 03:40:58,060
That was a long time ago.

2504
03:41:07,060 --> 03:41:13,060
No, they thought I was, they thought that I being a hand model meant

2505
03:41:13,060 --> 03:41:19,060
that I wasn't going to, excuse me, that I wasn't going to be a doctor.

2506
03:41:20,060 --> 03:41:22,060
That's it.

2507
03:41:34,060 --> 03:41:40,060
At least that's what they're, my thought, uh, brain, brain thoughts were.

2508
03:41:40,060 --> 03:41:49,060
My parents are like, my parents are very nice when I succeed.

2509
03:41:49,060 --> 03:41:56,060
When I don't succeed, I get, I get lambasted, man.

2510
03:41:56,060 --> 03:42:00,060
I get like, told I'm a failure.

2511
03:42:00,060 --> 03:42:02,060
I will mount to nothing.

2512
03:42:02,060 --> 03:42:06,060
But now that I have a job and they're like, oh, look at the paycheck.

2513
03:42:06,060 --> 03:42:09,060
They're like, okay, we support you now.

2514
03:42:12,060 --> 03:42:14,060
We're so happy you're here.

2515
03:42:30,060 --> 03:42:32,060
Yeah, money really talks.

2516
03:42:32,060 --> 03:42:34,060
That's how I get my love.

2517
03:42:36,060 --> 03:42:41,060
Although, although they were quite worried for me during COVID because

2518
03:42:41,060 --> 03:42:43,060
of my immunity.

2519
03:42:45,060 --> 03:42:56,060
They love, um, they love the fact that, uh, that I was at home because

2520
03:42:56,060 --> 03:42:57,060
they knew I was safe.

2521
03:42:57,060 --> 03:42:58,060
I know that they love me very much.

2522
03:42:58,060 --> 03:43:04,060
But like when they kind of perceive things as failures, it was, it was kind

2523
03:43:04,060 --> 03:43:05,060
of hard.

2524
03:43:05,060 --> 03:43:06,060
It was kind of hard.

2525
03:43:06,060 --> 03:43:13,060
Like for example, I remember when I said I didn't want to be a doctor.

2526
03:43:13,060 --> 03:43:19,060
When I said I didn't want to be a doctor, I was kicked out of my house.

2527
03:43:22,060 --> 03:43:24,060
I was kicked out of my house.

2528
03:43:24,060 --> 03:43:30,060
Like, yeah, I was kicked out of my house.

2529
03:43:30,060 --> 03:43:39,060
I, I was told that I, they wish I was never, I had never been born and

2530
03:43:39,060 --> 03:43:44,060
that they should have gotten a boy instead.

2531
03:43:44,060 --> 03:43:45,060
That kind of thing.

2532
03:43:50,060 --> 03:43:52,060
Asian parents, of course.

2533
03:43:53,060 --> 03:43:56,060
Well, that's getting dark.

2534
03:43:56,060 --> 03:43:57,060
Sorry.

2535
03:43:57,060 --> 03:43:58,060
Sorry.

2536
03:43:58,060 --> 03:43:59,060
Sorry.

2537
03:43:59,060 --> 03:44:00,060
Trauma dump.

2538
03:44:00,060 --> 03:44:03,060
I can trauma dump on you, but you can't trauma dump on me.

2539
03:44:10,060 --> 03:44:13,060
But they've changed their tune.

2540
03:44:13,060 --> 03:44:16,060
Now they've changed their tune quite a bit.

2541
03:44:17,060 --> 03:44:25,060
Because, uh, money speaks, money speaks.

2542
03:44:25,060 --> 03:44:30,060
And they kind of, honestly, they kind of gave up on me.

2543
03:44:32,060 --> 03:44:34,060
They kind of gave up on me.

2544
03:44:34,060 --> 03:44:40,060
So they kind of gave up on me.

2545
03:44:40,060 --> 03:44:45,060
And at a certain time they wanted me at home more because of my usefulness.

2546
03:44:47,060 --> 03:44:56,060
They wanted me at home more because things were getting a little bit more hard for them.

2547
03:44:56,060 --> 03:45:02,060
And my sister lives, like, she has her own family, right?

2548
03:45:02,060 --> 03:45:06,060
So I was the, I'm the only one that's like, kind of available.

2549
03:45:06,060 --> 03:45:10,060
And they were like, you know, they started to be like, they started to change their

2550
03:45:10,060 --> 03:45:13,060
minds about like, what is, what's success.

2551
03:45:14,060 --> 03:45:18,060
And I think they feel a bit of regret, uh, what they did to me.

2552
03:45:18,060 --> 03:45:24,060
But I remember last year they were like, you should go to the, you should try to get a job, sweetie.

2553
03:45:27,060 --> 03:45:33,060
They were very nice, uh, last year when I was having, uh, a rough time.

2554
03:45:33,060 --> 03:45:40,060
But, uh, once I got, once I got to VLR, they were like, woohoo!

2555
03:45:44,060 --> 03:45:48,060
Yeah, they need you and worry about you since they're getting old now.

2556
03:45:48,060 --> 03:45:50,060
Yeah, pretty much.

2557
03:45:53,060 --> 03:46:07,060
But like, before that it was like, oh, it's, it's always like, you know, um, it was like, you are a failure.

2558
03:46:07,060 --> 03:46:09,060
You shouldn't have ever been born.

2559
03:46:09,060 --> 03:46:12,060
I wish it was, okay.

2560
03:46:12,060 --> 03:46:13,060
No, I'm not going to say that one.

2561
03:46:13,060 --> 03:46:15,060
That one's, that one's oversharing.

2562
03:46:19,060 --> 03:46:20,060
That one's oversharing.

2563
03:46:20,060 --> 03:46:22,060
I'm going to, I'm going to shut up right there.

2564
03:46:27,060 --> 03:46:32,060
Okay, but yeah, but now that I have a bit of success, uh, they are very happy.

2565
03:46:32,060 --> 03:46:37,060
So thank you some bikes for supporting me because now I live in peace.

2566
03:46:39,060 --> 03:46:40,060
I live in peace.

2567
03:46:48,060 --> 03:47:00,060
I live in peace and I'm very happy and they're happy and they, uh, they, they have calmed down quite a bit

2568
03:47:00,060 --> 03:47:05,060
and their, their ideas of success has changed and now they're just like, please get a play button.

2569
03:47:05,060 --> 03:47:06,060
I want to see one.

2570
03:47:10,060 --> 03:47:12,060
You know, kind of like that, that sort of thing.

2571
03:47:12,060 --> 03:47:14,060
Like a lot of things change.

2572
03:47:15,060 --> 03:47:16,060
A lot of things change.

2573
03:47:22,060 --> 03:47:24,060
Yeah, things have mellowed out quite a bit.

2574
03:47:24,060 --> 03:47:31,060
Like if you looked at them like maybe like five years ago, you've been like, who the heck are they?

2575
03:47:34,060 --> 03:47:37,060
You've been like, what the heck happened?

2576
03:47:38,060 --> 03:47:40,060
But they have completely changed.

2577
03:47:40,060 --> 03:47:42,060
It was like, it's, I don't know.

2578
03:47:48,060 --> 03:47:50,060
It's like, uh, what do you call it?

2579
03:47:51,060 --> 03:47:55,060
It's like, I don't know, like something really changed within them.

2580
03:47:55,060 --> 03:47:57,060
I don't really know what happened.

2581
03:47:57,060 --> 03:48:04,060
Maybe they saw a movie, maybe, you know, maybe COVID changed something and they were like, oh,

2582
03:48:05,060 --> 03:48:10,060
I mean, like they were, even before COVID happened, they, they really did change quite a bit.

2583
03:48:11,060 --> 03:48:12,060
How long was COVID?

2584
03:48:12,060 --> 03:48:13,060
Oh shit.

2585
03:48:13,060 --> 03:48:22,060
Okay, let's just say like 10 years ago, 10 years ago, it was like, they were like completely different.

2586
03:48:27,060 --> 03:48:28,060
That was almost four years.

2587
03:48:28,060 --> 03:48:29,060
Shit.

2588
03:48:30,060 --> 03:48:32,060
Shit, ignore that.

2589
03:48:35,060 --> 03:48:40,060
Okay, let's say 10 years ago.

2590
03:48:40,060 --> 03:48:43,060
Yeah, 10 years ago, they would have been like completely different people.

2591
03:48:54,060 --> 03:48:58,060
Yeah, I think it's a lot of them are like, oh.

2592
03:49:04,060 --> 03:49:10,060
I guess it's like, you know, maybe like they're starting to see things in more a positive light because they're getting older.

2593
03:49:13,060 --> 03:49:16,060
Maybe they're getting older or something, but they're very happy.

2594
03:49:17,060 --> 03:49:19,060
Trust, they're very happy.

2595
03:49:25,060 --> 03:49:27,060
I love them, I love them to bits.

2596
03:49:27,060 --> 03:49:32,060
Don't get me wrong, it gets hard sometimes, but I love them to bits.

2597
03:49:32,060 --> 03:49:34,060
Why are we even on the subject again?

2598
03:49:35,060 --> 03:49:36,060
Oh yeah, money talks.

2599
03:49:40,060 --> 03:49:41,060
It sure took a while.

2600
03:49:41,060 --> 03:49:43,060
Yeah, it sure took a while.

2601
03:49:44,060 --> 03:49:55,060
I don't know, something happened and they were like, you know, and they, they, they've even started to like talk to my sister more because

2602
03:49:56,060 --> 03:50:06,060
They usually don't really talk to my sister as much, but now they're like contacting her more like getting updates from her and stuff.

2603
03:50:09,060 --> 03:50:10,060
They brought back memories.

2604
03:50:10,060 --> 03:50:11,060
All right.

2605
03:50:13,060 --> 03:50:14,060
My dad.

2606
03:50:14,060 --> 03:50:15,060
Wow.

2607
03:50:15,060 --> 03:50:16,060
I'm so yappy.

2608
03:50:17,060 --> 03:50:18,060
Oh, it ain't just crazy.

2609
03:50:18,060 --> 03:50:19,060
Yeah, like people change quite a bit.

2610
03:50:19,060 --> 03:50:24,060
Like I didn't think it would happen, but they did change quite a bit.

2611
03:50:25,060 --> 03:50:26,060
Hold up.

2612
03:50:26,060 --> 03:50:27,060
Are you sure they aren't dying?

2613
03:50:28,060 --> 03:50:29,060
I sure hope not.

2614
03:50:33,060 --> 03:50:35,060
I sure hope fucking not.

2615
03:50:35,060 --> 03:50:39,060
I, because I would have to take a few weeks off.

2616
03:50:39,060 --> 03:50:40,060
Not going to lie.

2617
03:50:40,060 --> 03:50:46,060
If, if don't do not, do not like, you know, invoke that.

2618
03:50:46,060 --> 03:50:47,060
Okay.

2619
03:50:48,060 --> 03:50:51,060
Like I do not want that to happen.

2620
03:50:56,060 --> 03:50:57,060
Just saying.

2621
03:50:57,060 --> 03:50:59,060
Like I do not want that to happen.

2622
03:50:59,060 --> 03:51:00,060
Like no jinxing.

2623
03:51:00,060 --> 03:51:01,060
No, no, nothing.

2624
03:51:02,060 --> 03:51:08,060
I do not want that to happen because I will have to like probably take a few weeks off.

2625
03:51:12,060 --> 03:51:15,060
Do you know if it's old age or a mix of old age and now having a job?

2626
03:51:15,060 --> 03:51:16,060
I don't know.

2627
03:51:16,060 --> 03:51:21,060
I think honestly, maybe like their mindsets just changed.

2628
03:51:22,060 --> 03:51:23,060
You know,

2629
03:51:24,060 --> 03:51:29,060
like their, their mindsets

2630
03:51:33,060 --> 03:51:34,060
changed.

2631
03:51:34,060 --> 03:51:37,060
I guess maybe they saw a movie or a documentary or something.

2632
03:51:37,060 --> 03:51:42,060
But like, you know, maybe it's like, you know, they, they literally had to change your heart.

2633
03:51:47,060 --> 03:51:49,060
It's probably just old age and missing me.

2634
03:51:49,060 --> 03:51:50,060
Yeah.

2635
03:51:50,060 --> 03:51:51,060
Things like that.

2636
03:51:53,060 --> 03:51:54,060
Wow.

2637
03:51:54,060 --> 03:51:55,060
So self, wow.

2638
03:51:55,060 --> 03:51:56,060
A few weeks off.

2639
03:51:56,060 --> 03:51:57,060
So selfish.

2640
03:51:57,060 --> 03:52:00,060
How unwarranted.

2641
03:52:00,060 --> 03:52:04,060
I feel like people will get mad, get mad about that.

2642
03:52:04,060 --> 03:52:05,060
I don't know.

2643
03:52:05,060 --> 03:52:07,060
I feel, I would feel guilty.

2644
03:52:07,060 --> 03:52:15,060
I would feel guilty on both ways because then like I need time to grieve, but also that

2645
03:52:15,060 --> 03:52:19,060
if I'm not working, I feel bad kind of thing.

2646
03:52:20,060 --> 03:52:22,060
Something they saw on Netflix.

2647
03:52:22,060 --> 03:52:28,060
Maybe it was something they saw on Netflix and was like, we don't want to turn out like that.

2648
03:52:46,060 --> 03:52:47,060
Like things like that.

2649
03:52:47,060 --> 03:52:48,060
I don't know.

2650
03:52:48,060 --> 03:52:49,060
I'm just like weird in the mind.

2651
03:52:49,060 --> 03:52:52,060
They ran a fortune cookie and had a revelation.

2652
03:52:52,060 --> 03:52:53,060
It could be.

2653
03:52:53,060 --> 03:52:54,060
I don't know.

2654
03:52:59,060 --> 03:53:03,060
So yeah, that's why I'm just like, oh, I don't really know.

2655
03:53:08,060 --> 03:53:12,060
I don't really know, but I really don't want that to happen because I love them.

2656
03:53:12,060 --> 03:53:14,060
I love, love, love, love, love my parents.

2657
03:53:14,060 --> 03:53:17,060
Like I am very close to my family.

2658
03:53:19,060 --> 03:53:23,060
Even if they're a little, even if they're still a little overbearing.

2659
03:53:27,060 --> 03:53:33,060
They became, I guess they've turned from like what, like tiger parents to like helicopter

2660
03:53:33,060 --> 03:53:34,060
parents instead.

2661
03:53:45,060 --> 03:53:50,060
One is a little bit more relieving than the other.

2662
03:53:58,060 --> 03:54:00,060
It's an upgrade.

2663
03:54:00,060 --> 03:54:05,060
They evolved into helicopters, you know, because they've always want to be a part of my life

2664
03:54:05,060 --> 03:54:06,060
now.

2665
03:54:06,060 --> 03:54:09,060
Like when I said I was going to move there, like, do you hate us?

2666
03:54:10,060 --> 03:54:14,060
Or when I was like, oh yeah, I was talking to my friend, talking about going to a new

2667
03:54:14,060 --> 03:54:15,060
neighborhood.

2668
03:54:15,060 --> 03:54:17,060
They're like, are we moving?

2669
03:54:24,060 --> 03:54:30,060
It's always like they want to always be with me, which is very, very sweet, but I also

2670
03:54:30,060 --> 03:54:31,060
want my privacy.

2671
03:54:31,060 --> 03:54:41,060
You should have said yes, no, no, I don't want to lie to them or anything or get their hopes

2672
03:54:41,060 --> 03:54:47,060
up for, you know, like when I moved to Japan a little bit, that was the first time I've

2673
03:54:47,060 --> 03:54:51,060
ever like really been away from them.

2674
03:54:53,060 --> 03:54:59,060
And at the time they're like, if you get a job in Japan, we'll move to Japan.

2675
03:55:01,060 --> 03:55:02,060
I remember that.

2676
03:55:02,060 --> 03:55:03,060
They're like, we'll move.

2677
03:55:03,060 --> 03:55:04,060
We'll find property.

2678
03:55:04,060 --> 03:55:07,060
We'll live somewhere close to your work.

2679
03:55:09,060 --> 03:55:10,060
Oh, you were in Japan?

2680
03:55:10,060 --> 03:55:14,060
Yeah, I lived in Japan for like three months.

2681
03:55:14,060 --> 03:55:27,060
For an internship, I was like kind of the first time that I wanted that I was like, okay.

2682
03:55:27,060 --> 03:55:31,060
Okay, I want to, I want to go somewhere.

2683
03:55:31,060 --> 03:55:36,060
Like I didn't really matter where I wanted to go at first.

2684
03:55:36,060 --> 03:55:46,060
It was France, Paris, but then they didn't have enough people for that program, for the

2685
03:55:46,060 --> 03:55:48,060
internship program.

2686
03:55:48,060 --> 03:56:06,060
So then it was changed to Korea, but then Korea wanted like, I think they were prioritizing

2687
03:56:06,060 --> 03:56:14,060
like computer software and I didn't major in like computer programming or anything.

2688
03:56:14,060 --> 03:56:19,060
So that wasn't my area of expertise.

2689
03:56:19,060 --> 03:56:29,060
So then I was sent to Japan because they're like, because that is like the fields of study.

2690
03:56:29,060 --> 03:56:36,060
They had some stuff in my field of study that was there and someone like a company in Japan

2691
03:56:36,060 --> 03:56:38,060
wanted me to intern there.

2692
03:56:38,060 --> 03:56:43,060
So I was taken to that company.

2693
03:56:43,060 --> 03:56:58,060
So yeah, so yeah, I was taken to that company, but in order to move there, I would have to

2694
03:56:58,060 --> 03:57:00,060
be like just by myself.

2695
03:57:00,060 --> 03:57:01,060
Yeah.

2696
03:57:01,060 --> 03:57:05,060
How much of a weeb were you going to Japan versus after?

2697
03:57:05,060 --> 03:57:07,060
I was always a weeb.

2698
03:57:07,060 --> 03:57:11,060
I was just a coincidence that I was like going to Japan.

2699
03:57:11,060 --> 03:57:13,060
I was like kind of excited, you know?

2700
03:57:13,060 --> 03:57:23,060
I was kind of excited for it because I was like, oh yeah, I can go to like may cafes now

2701
03:57:23,060 --> 03:57:26,060
and I can look at like my favorite anime merch stuff.

2702
03:57:26,060 --> 03:57:35,060
It was a bonus, but like originally, originally I didn't plan to go to Japan.

2703
03:57:35,060 --> 03:57:42,060
It was like, you know, like this program that you wanted to go into isn't available anymore.

2704
03:57:42,060 --> 03:57:43,060
How about here?

2705
03:57:43,060 --> 03:57:44,060
No.

2706
03:57:44,060 --> 03:57:45,060
Well, here we go.

2707
03:57:45,060 --> 03:57:47,060
So it just happened.

2708
03:57:47,060 --> 03:57:55,060
The maids must have been all over you.

2709
03:57:55,060 --> 03:58:00,060
They were very impressed that I had no shame.

2710
03:58:01,060 --> 03:58:06,060
And I did the magic spells and everything, and the dances with them.

2711
03:58:06,060 --> 03:58:17,060
Like everyone else is like hanging their heads long going like doki doki moe moe cute.

2712
03:58:17,060 --> 03:58:21,060
And I was like, oh moe moe cute.

2713
03:58:21,060 --> 03:58:24,060
You know, because I had no shame.

2714
03:58:30,060 --> 03:58:32,060
I had no shame about it.

2715
03:58:32,060 --> 03:58:36,060
I was like, yeah, let me, let me, let me do the magic spells and stuff.

2716
03:58:36,060 --> 03:58:37,060
Okay, here.

2717
03:58:37,060 --> 03:58:41,060
Yeah, magic, magic, whatever.

2718
03:58:45,060 --> 03:58:47,060
Like literally no shame.

2719
03:58:47,060 --> 03:58:52,060
And you know, people's first time at cafes are like, oh, they're really shy, right?

2720
03:58:52,060 --> 03:58:59,060
Because it's like, it's very surprising when you go in there and suddenly, you know,

2721
03:58:59,060 --> 03:59:05,060
they're kind of like, ah, they're kind of like, oh, welcome master.

2722
03:59:05,060 --> 03:59:07,060
And I'm like, ah.

2723
03:59:12,060 --> 03:59:19,060
So they were like, so I literally was like, oh, I don't care.

2724
03:59:19,060 --> 03:59:20,060
I don't care.

2725
03:59:20,060 --> 03:59:22,060
I'm going to do the magic spell.

2726
03:59:24,060 --> 03:59:25,060
I'm going to do the magic spell.

2727
03:59:25,060 --> 03:59:26,060
I'm going to do it.

2728
03:59:26,060 --> 03:59:35,060
And then it's funny because the, the maid that like served me was like, do you want to be a maid?

2729
03:59:35,060 --> 03:59:39,060
I said, I'm sorry, but my visa does not allow me to stay that long.

2730
03:59:39,060 --> 03:59:43,060
And my visa doesn't allow me to work any other job.

2731
03:59:50,060 --> 03:59:52,060
I remember that very nicely.

2732
03:59:52,060 --> 03:59:54,060
I took a picture.

2733
03:59:56,060 --> 04:00:00,060
Did you outcringe the maid?

2734
04:00:00,060 --> 04:00:01,060
I probably did.

2735
04:00:01,060 --> 04:00:04,060
Honestly, I probably outcrenched them.

2736
04:00:04,060 --> 04:00:05,060
Yes.

2737
04:00:05,060 --> 04:00:07,060
I was very, I feel like I was also very respectful.

2738
04:00:07,060 --> 04:00:11,060
I didn't really, I didn't want to break any of the rules either.

2739
04:00:11,060 --> 04:00:16,060
So I feel like, would you have been a maid if it did let you though?

2740
04:00:16,060 --> 04:00:17,060
Maybe.

2741
04:00:17,060 --> 04:00:18,060
Maybe.

2742
04:00:18,060 --> 04:00:19,060
Maybe.

2743
04:00:22,060 --> 04:00:23,060
Maybe.

2744
04:00:23,060 --> 04:00:24,060
Maybe I would have.

2745
04:00:24,060 --> 04:00:25,060
Maybe I would have.

2746
04:00:25,060 --> 04:00:26,060
But I was also worried.

2747
04:00:26,060 --> 04:00:36,060
I don't know that much Japanese, but it was, my Japanese was much better, much better when I was constantly talking to people.

2748
04:00:41,060 --> 04:00:44,060
When I was constantly talking to people, but I came back.

2749
04:00:45,060 --> 04:00:49,060
I came back and yeah, you have to practice it.

2750
04:00:49,060 --> 04:00:51,060
I probably have to practice it.

2751
04:00:52,060 --> 04:01:00,060
Honestly, I'm very rusty now, but the friends I've made in Japan have been a senpai.

2752
04:01:03,060 --> 04:01:07,060
Thank you for the two, darlin' b-sepai.

2753
04:01:07,060 --> 04:01:12,060
I think you're an incredibly honest and sweet girl and you definitely wear your heart on your sleeve.

2754
04:01:12,060 --> 04:01:14,060
Thank you for treating all of us so well.

2755
04:01:14,060 --> 04:01:16,060
I really, really wish you nothing but the best for you.

2756
04:01:16,060 --> 04:01:18,060
Thank you senpai.

2757
04:01:20,060 --> 04:01:27,060
It's, yeah, my, my friends in Japan have been like, what are you going to visit us again?

2758
04:01:32,060 --> 04:01:34,060
And I was like, I don't know.

2759
04:01:34,060 --> 04:01:41,060
I'm kind of, I'm a little busy now, so, so I would love to go, but I'm a little busy now.

2760
04:01:41,060 --> 04:01:43,060
I'm settling into my new job.

2761
04:01:46,060 --> 04:01:48,060
Oh, I got clocked though, I got clocked.

2762
04:01:48,060 --> 04:01:49,060
I got clocked.

2763
04:01:49,060 --> 04:01:51,060
They were like, are you a Vtuber?

2764
04:01:51,060 --> 04:01:58,060
I was like, please, please, please, how did you clock me so fast?

2765
04:02:08,060 --> 04:02:10,060
How did you clock me so fast?

2766
04:02:12,060 --> 04:02:15,060
And they were like, oh, it's because you've always had like a cute voice.

2767
04:02:17,060 --> 04:02:20,060
And I was like, I just like a popular job now.

2768
04:02:20,060 --> 04:02:21,060
And I'm like,

2769
04:02:27,060 --> 04:02:29,060
They're secretly in the chat right now.

2770
04:02:29,060 --> 04:02:35,060
I don't think so, because I don't think they watched that.

2771
04:02:36,060 --> 04:02:45,060
But I think it's because my laugh is weird and they've always said that my voice was cute.

2772
04:02:48,060 --> 04:02:58,060
I know, I know, it's, it's, it's, uh, some people will be like, no, no, your voice is not cute.

2773
04:02:58,060 --> 04:03:01,060
But when I was in Japan, they thought I was very cute.

2774
04:03:02,060 --> 04:03:17,060
Like I had so many people ask me if I wanted to try voice acting, if I was a professional voice actor, if I wanted to do something in entertainment.

2775
04:03:17,060 --> 04:03:24,060
And I was like, I've never had people say that my voice is nice before, except for when I was in Japan.

2776
04:03:24,060 --> 04:03:35,060
Except for when I was in Japan was the only time that people said my voice is cute.

2777
04:03:35,060 --> 04:03:41,060
And yeah, they were like, it was really cute.

2778
04:03:45,060 --> 04:03:52,060
So that's why they were like, I think that's why, I think that's why Senpai, I think, I think, I think that's why.

2779
04:03:54,060 --> 04:03:57,060
And they're like, you became a Vtuber, didn't you?

2780
04:04:04,060 --> 04:04:15,060
I think, yeah, yeah, that was, uh, I remember, I remember very well, they were like, oh my gosh, you could totally do like voice acting and stuff.

2781
04:04:16,060 --> 04:04:23,060
And they were telling me this and like, um, at like work and stuff.

2782
04:04:23,060 --> 04:04:24,060
And I was like, thank you.

2783
04:04:25,060 --> 04:04:29,060
And then, oh yeah, another hand store, you know the hand modeling thing?

2784
04:04:31,060 --> 04:04:38,060
In Japan, they were like, at my work, at my work, when I was in Japan, they were like, we need to do like a picture thing.

2785
04:04:38,060 --> 04:04:41,060
Your hands are very nice, please model your hands for us.

2786
04:04:42,060 --> 04:04:45,060
I forgot about that.

2787
04:04:51,060 --> 04:04:57,060
They needed to do like some product, um, some product placement and advertising something.

2788
04:04:57,060 --> 04:05:00,060
They were like, can you please use your hands to model?

2789
04:05:04,060 --> 04:05:06,060
I remember that, oh my gosh.

2790
04:05:06,060 --> 04:05:10,060
Wow, it connected, everything connected again.

2791
04:05:11,060 --> 04:05:19,060
I remember that, I remember I had to like do like flipping, flipping like papers and stuff.

2792
04:05:22,060 --> 04:05:27,060
Did you, I did, I did volunteer to do that because they thought, my hands look nice.

2793
04:05:30,060 --> 04:05:32,060
Japan seems right for you, you should go back someday.

2794
04:05:32,060 --> 04:05:35,060
Um, I was like very lonely.

2795
04:05:35,060 --> 04:05:37,060
It was very lonely.

2796
04:05:37,060 --> 04:05:51,060
I had a great time, but it was very lonely and I feel like I would not go there unless I was like with friends or family because there was a lot about Japan that I didn't like.

2797
04:05:51,060 --> 04:06:03,060
There's a lot about Japan that I didn't like that I would probably, um, and that's the only reason why I'm kind of like, I don't know.

2798
04:06:03,060 --> 04:06:30,060
I don't know if I would live there, but if I do, if I do like, no, it's like, well, it was kind of like, oh, if I got into like a Japanese Vtuber company, I might move, but like, my company's not Japanese, so, there's no point in moving now, right?

2799
04:06:34,060 --> 04:06:38,060
There's no point, there's no point in moving now.

2800
04:06:38,060 --> 04:06:44,060
So it's mostly like, uh, yeah, the work culture was really rough.

2801
04:06:46,060 --> 04:06:49,060
The otherness was really tough too.

2802
04:06:49,060 --> 04:07:02,060
Even though people were very nice to me, there was also that barrier where it was kind of like, um, it was kind of like, oh, you will always be like the foreign girl.

2803
04:07:03,060 --> 04:07:11,060
Or, and then they wouldn't invite me to like certain social events because I would be like the foreigner, right?

2804
04:07:14,060 --> 04:07:29,060
So like, and then at times I wouldn't understand certain, like, certain social cues that is common for them, but not to me.

2805
04:07:29,060 --> 04:07:37,060
So for example, I've learned in Japan, maybe means no, and no means go fuck yourself, and yes means maybe, right?

2806
04:07:44,060 --> 04:07:51,060
So, you know, I would follow up on like plans when people were like, oh, maybe.

2807
04:07:51,060 --> 04:07:57,060
Like for example, I'd be like, oh, do you want to go to like this after work or something?

2808
04:07:57,060 --> 04:08:03,060
And they'll be like, maybe, and I would follow up.

2809
04:08:03,060 --> 04:08:06,060
And some people didn't like the fact that I followed up.

2810
04:08:06,060 --> 04:08:14,060
So for example, I was like, oh, you said maybe, are you still free to do this thing?

2811
04:08:14,060 --> 04:08:17,060
And they would be like, oh, I meant no.

2812
04:08:17,060 --> 04:08:21,060
And that would not put me in a great position, you know?

2813
04:08:25,060 --> 04:08:28,060
That didn't put me in a great position.

2814
04:08:30,060 --> 04:08:36,060
And there were some people who really did not like me because I did not understand certain things.

2815
04:08:36,060 --> 04:08:37,060
Yeah.

2816
04:08:38,060 --> 04:08:45,060
And I would also, at work, I would also get a lot of migraines, a lot of migraines.

2817
04:08:45,060 --> 04:08:48,060
And I was, I felt very lonely.

2818
04:08:48,060 --> 04:09:08,060
So, I would sometimes like put my head on the desk because I would have a really bad migraine.

2819
04:09:09,060 --> 04:09:19,060
Or I had a lack of sleep because there was an issue with the dorm I was in, which was that people were partying really late into the night.

2820
04:09:19,060 --> 04:09:23,060
Like migraines due to what? I don't know. I just had migraines.

2821
04:09:23,060 --> 04:09:27,060
I've never had migraines in my life before, but I had migraines when I was in Japan.

2822
04:09:27,060 --> 04:09:41,060
And I would put my head on the desk and I viewed that as like, you know, blaziness and like, they would think that I was like trying to avoid work.

2823
04:09:46,060 --> 04:09:50,060
And being disrespectful, yeah, but like the lights were like really hard on me.

2824
04:09:50,060 --> 04:09:56,060
And so I just like, just put my head on my desk because I was like, okay, it's dark, dark there.

2825
04:09:56,060 --> 04:09:57,060
And I feel better.

2826
04:09:57,060 --> 04:10:04,060
Well, I think most people feel better when you have a migraine, like the dark and light hurts, right?

2827
04:10:07,060 --> 04:10:12,060
So like, there are things that made me feel very lonely, very, very other.

2828
04:10:13,060 --> 04:10:20,060
And there are things that I felt like, you know, but like the friends that I did make were very nice to me.

2829
04:10:20,060 --> 04:10:30,060
And I've made, I think only like, like maybe two friends at my work that were very friendly and they really liked me, right?

2830
04:10:30,060 --> 04:10:34,060
So those were the friends that were like, we love your hands.

2831
04:10:34,060 --> 04:10:38,060
We think you're like a great voice actor, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

2832
04:10:38,060 --> 04:10:40,060
And they would like talk to me constantly.

2833
04:10:41,060 --> 04:10:44,060
So those are the friends I kept in touch with, right?

2834
04:10:48,060 --> 04:11:02,060
So yeah, that's why I'm just like, you know, it's like, I would, I would probably be like, I would go, but I'm not sure if I would live there.

2835
04:11:02,060 --> 04:11:10,060
But if I had, if it's something that was like, oh, for example, I don't know, maybe if I get a lot of work in Japan for some reason, right?

2836
04:11:10,060 --> 04:11:14,060
If I get a lot of work in Japan for some reason, I would probably move to Japan.

2837
04:11:14,060 --> 04:11:17,060
But that's kind of like not likely.

2838
04:11:17,060 --> 04:11:21,060
So that would, that's not a thought in my head now.

2839
04:11:21,060 --> 04:11:24,060
So it's more like I would visit instead.

2840
04:11:25,060 --> 04:11:30,060
Yeah, Dark and Silent Lens was good for migraines.

2841
04:11:30,060 --> 04:11:42,060
And I, they got really mad at me when I turned off the radio, when I turned off the radio, the work radio, and it wasn't a good work radio.

2842
04:11:42,060 --> 04:11:46,060
It was like really like, like super staticky.

2843
04:11:46,060 --> 04:11:51,060
And they would be mad at me for adjusting it to the rights.

2844
04:11:51,060 --> 04:11:53,060
Like I knew which station they were on.

2845
04:11:53,060 --> 04:12:07,060
I just adjusted it to like the right one, or I would lower the volume a bit on the, on the radio, because it was like physically hurting, hurting me.

2846
04:12:07,060 --> 04:12:09,060
So yeah.

2847
04:12:13,060 --> 04:12:14,060
That's like something.

2848
04:12:14,060 --> 04:12:16,060
There were some things that I liked and some things I didn't like.

2849
04:12:16,060 --> 04:12:18,060
And I felt very, yeah.

2850
04:12:18,060 --> 04:12:19,060
Wow.

2851
04:12:19,060 --> 04:12:20,060
You're welcome.

2852
04:12:26,060 --> 04:12:30,060
Like I didn't know why they, they wanted it on static.

2853
04:12:30,060 --> 04:12:33,060
I really didn't understand why they wanted it on static.

2854
04:12:33,060 --> 04:12:36,060
So I always thought that they didn't adjust it right.

2855
04:12:36,060 --> 04:12:41,060
And then I just adjusted it to the right channel so it was clear.

2856
04:12:41,060 --> 04:12:43,060
And then they got mad at me for that.

2857
04:12:43,060 --> 04:12:45,060
I didn't understand why.

2858
04:12:46,060 --> 04:12:51,060
Or like if I would turn down the radio a little bit.

2859
04:12:56,060 --> 04:12:57,060
I don't know.

2860
04:12:57,060 --> 04:12:58,060
It was weird.

2861
04:13:01,060 --> 04:13:06,060
Maybe it is their, their white noise, but I don't, I never understood.

2862
04:13:06,060 --> 04:13:07,060
And I asked them like why.

2863
04:13:07,060 --> 04:13:09,060
And they're like, don't touch the radio.

2864
04:13:09,060 --> 04:13:14,060
And I was like, but it's, I'm adjusting it.

2865
04:13:14,060 --> 04:13:16,060
So it's to the right station.

2866
04:13:16,060 --> 04:13:24,060
Like, you know how the, the static, the static, if you're not quite on the radio,

2867
04:13:24,060 --> 04:13:28,060
like the, the right one, you can still hear it.

2868
04:13:28,060 --> 04:13:35,060
But it's like super crunchy and, and like it's bad.

2869
04:13:35,060 --> 04:13:36,060
Like it's crackly.

2870
04:13:36,060 --> 04:13:37,060
Right.

2871
04:13:37,060 --> 04:13:42,060
So I just adjusted it slightly to be like, hey, like get the right frequency.

2872
04:13:42,060 --> 04:13:43,060
Come on.

2873
04:13:45,060 --> 04:13:54,060
You know, like it's, it's like, it's almost there.

2874
04:13:54,060 --> 04:13:58,060
You can still hear what's going on, but it's really crunchy.

2875
04:13:58,060 --> 04:14:01,060
So I don't know why they wanted it to be like that.

2876
04:14:01,060 --> 04:14:05,060
But they were like, definitely like demanding me going like, do not touch the radio.

2877
04:14:05,060 --> 04:14:12,060
And I'm like, okay, but like this, it's really distracting.

2878
04:14:12,060 --> 04:14:14,060
Why can't I touch the radio?

2879
04:14:14,060 --> 04:14:18,060
Why is it not on the right frequency?

2880
04:14:18,060 --> 04:14:20,060
And so like it's, it's, it was weird.

2881
04:14:20,060 --> 04:14:21,060
It was weird.

2882
04:14:23,060 --> 04:14:24,060
It was weird.

2883
04:14:24,060 --> 04:14:27,060
So the workplace was definitely like a mixed bag.

2884
04:14:27,060 --> 04:14:29,060
So I had some very nice people.

2885
04:14:29,060 --> 04:14:31,060
They were very kind to me.

2886
04:14:31,060 --> 04:14:38,060
And then sometimes it was just like moments where I was just like, oh, come on.

2887
04:14:38,060 --> 04:14:40,060
The beginning of the audio file.

2888
04:14:40,060 --> 04:14:43,060
I wouldn't consider myself of audio file.

2889
04:14:43,060 --> 04:14:46,060
I wouldn't consider myself an audio file.

2890
04:14:50,060 --> 04:14:57,060
I wouldn't because it's like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't consider myself an audio file.

2891
04:14:57,060 --> 04:15:01,060
No, because like if you tell me what's the difference between this and this,

2892
04:15:01,060 --> 04:15:03,060
I would have no idea what you're talking about.

2893
04:15:03,060 --> 04:15:11,060
Like if you tell me this is a warm, warm sound versus a bright sound.

2894
04:15:11,060 --> 04:15:14,060
I wouldn't freaking understand.

2895
04:15:14,060 --> 04:15:16,060
You're interested in audio stuff.

2896
04:15:16,060 --> 04:15:17,060
Yes.

2897
04:15:17,060 --> 04:15:19,060
Improving my own audio stuff.

2898
04:15:29,060 --> 04:15:31,060
It's an, I can't do it.

2899
04:15:31,060 --> 04:15:32,060
How's the IEMs?

2900
04:15:32,060 --> 04:15:35,060
The IEMs that I ordered have not come in yet,

2901
04:15:35,060 --> 04:15:41,060
but I have improved my current IEMs that I use.

2902
04:15:41,060 --> 04:15:49,060
And I think they'll be great for, for like audio monitoring in general.

2903
04:15:49,060 --> 04:15:54,060
I'm using with my, with the, with the Go X, XLR.

2904
04:15:55,060 --> 04:16:06,060
Because, because, excuse me, because, well,

2905
04:16:09,060 --> 04:16:11,060
I still need something for audio monitoring.

2906
04:16:11,060 --> 04:16:17,060
And the one that I ordered is DSP.

2907
04:16:17,060 --> 04:16:19,060
I think it's DSP or is a DPS.

2908
04:16:19,060 --> 04:16:21,060
I don't fucking remember.

2909
04:16:22,060 --> 04:16:27,060
So the ones I currently own are the Choo Toos.

2910
04:16:32,060 --> 04:16:33,060
Yeah, DSP.

2911
04:16:33,060 --> 04:16:34,060
Thank you.

2912
04:16:38,060 --> 04:16:41,060
Are the Choo Toos because they are very cheap.

2913
04:16:41,060 --> 04:16:49,060
I remember someone, I remember reading someone who was like a fanatic about moon drop.

2914
04:16:52,060 --> 04:16:55,060
About moon drop and I was like, oh, it must be a good brand.

2915
04:16:55,060 --> 04:17:01,060
And then they came out, I was looking at the Choo and I was like, uh, I don't know.

2916
04:17:01,060 --> 04:17:07,060
But then I was looking at like IEMs that were like, what do you call it?

2917
04:17:07,060 --> 04:17:10,060
Like they had like the, the cables.

2918
04:17:10,060 --> 04:17:11,060
Yeah.

2919
04:17:12,060 --> 04:17:15,060
And they announced the Choo Too.

2920
04:17:15,060 --> 04:17:22,060
And so I pre-ordered it and I pre-ordered it for like $220 or something.

2921
04:17:22,060 --> 04:17:25,060
And I was like, whatever, it's from a brand.

2922
04:17:25,060 --> 04:17:32,060
I know a few people, like I actually know more than one person, which is surprising.

2923
04:17:33,060 --> 04:17:38,060
Um, there are like big fans of this brand, Moon Drop.

2924
04:17:38,060 --> 04:17:40,060
So I was like, okay.

2925
04:17:40,060 --> 04:17:42,060
Um, okay, sure.

2926
04:17:42,060 --> 04:17:46,060
Uh, so I pre-ordered that one because it was, it's cheap as shit.

2927
04:17:46,060 --> 04:17:48,060
It's cheap as shit, right?

2928
04:17:48,060 --> 04:17:50,060
Like how can I say no to $20?

2929
04:17:50,060 --> 04:17:53,060
Like $20 Canadian too.

2930
04:17:53,060 --> 04:17:56,060
So I was like, oh, that's really affordable.

2931
04:17:56,060 --> 04:17:59,060
So I got that.

2932
04:18:00,060 --> 04:18:02,060
So I got that.

2933
04:18:02,060 --> 04:18:03,060
I got that.

2934
04:18:03,060 --> 04:18:06,060
And, you know, it was all right.

2935
04:18:06,060 --> 04:18:07,060
It was a lot.

2936
04:18:07,060 --> 04:18:08,060
All right.

2937
04:18:08,060 --> 04:18:10,060
Like it's, it's, it's cheap.

2938
04:18:10,060 --> 04:18:18,060
And I, I was like, um, I'm the type of person who I have to really decide on what to get.

2939
04:18:18,060 --> 04:18:30,060
Otherwise, um, I don't want to waste my time and my money, if that makes sense.

2940
04:18:30,060 --> 04:18:35,060
Um, so that's why I pick myself carefully.

2941
04:18:35,060 --> 04:18:37,060
So I can't really experiment Senpai.

2942
04:18:37,060 --> 04:18:45,060
I can't really experiment, um, with like, like if someone asked me, oh, what, what,

2943
04:18:45,060 --> 04:18:49,060
what have you noticed with, um, what was this question on Twitter?

2944
04:18:49,060 --> 04:18:50,060
Sorry, Senpai.

2945
04:18:50,060 --> 04:18:55,060
So I'm using you as a sample, as a sample, as a, uh, example.

2946
04:18:55,060 --> 04:19:01,060
But be, uh, like, what's your experience with audio interfaces?

2947
04:19:01,060 --> 04:19:08,060
And I'm like, I've only owned one audio interface kind of thing.

2948
04:19:08,060 --> 04:19:12,060
Like I'm not, I'm not that person.

2949
04:19:12,060 --> 04:19:23,060
I've only owned two, actually two audio interfaces, but, um, I don't have the funds to experiment,

2950
04:19:23,060 --> 04:19:24,060
I guess.

2951
04:19:24,060 --> 04:19:33,060
I don't have the funds to experiment, um, with, with like audio equipment.

2952
04:19:33,060 --> 04:19:35,060
So I have to choose very carefully.

2953
04:19:35,060 --> 04:19:43,060
I tend to choose, uh, choose like things on cheaper end that are very reliable.

2954
04:19:43,060 --> 04:19:45,060
For example, my microphone is an AT2020.

2955
04:19:45,060 --> 04:19:48,060
Very reliable, pretty freaking cheap.

2956
04:19:48,060 --> 04:19:52,060
Uh, if you get it on sale, it can be even just like 90 bucks.

2957
04:19:52,060 --> 04:20:00,060
I don't think I got it on sale though, because I had to replace an older USB microphone that I owned.

2958
04:20:00,060 --> 04:20:06,060
Uh, so I tend to choose things that are reliable.

2959
04:20:06,060 --> 04:20:09,060
So that's why I'm just like, if you were like, oh, are you into IEMs?

2960
04:20:09,060 --> 04:20:19,060
I'm just like, I will only, like, this is probably going to be the only IEM I ever own.

2961
04:20:19,060 --> 04:20:28,060
Unless, like, given the opportunity, maybe I might own three, max three.

2962
04:20:28,060 --> 04:20:38,060
So I just wanted to get something that was like reliable, because people were like, oh, you know, if you use IEMs, it's going to, it's going to change the way you, you listen to music for the rest of your life.

2963
04:20:38,060 --> 04:20:41,060
And like, you never hear music like this before.

2964
04:20:42,060 --> 04:20:49,060
So I was like, oh, okay, well, maybe I'll give it a shot.

2965
04:20:49,060 --> 04:20:58,060
And people were like, oh, IEMs are great for monitoring sound and like, you know, like doing studio stuff.

2966
04:20:58,060 --> 04:21:10,060
And I said, oh, okay, I'll give it a shot since I only exclusively basically use these open back heads, headphones that aren't very good for monitoring, right?

2967
04:21:10,060 --> 04:21:22,060
So I was like, okay, and then, you know, I saw the chew twos and they were like, oh, well, things are replaceable.

2968
04:21:22,060 --> 04:21:25,060
If the cable breaks, you can replace them.

2969
04:21:25,060 --> 04:21:28,060
There's, you can swap cables.

2970
04:21:28,060 --> 04:21:33,060
The filter can, can be changed and removed.

2971
04:21:33,060 --> 04:21:37,060
And I was like, oh, well, that sounds nice if it's like fixable.

2972
04:21:37,060 --> 04:21:42,060
Okay.

2973
04:21:42,060 --> 04:21:57,060
The only one I would probably want next would probably be the blessing three because everyone in their moms, everyone in their mom and the grandmas and the grandpas have said that like the blessing three is like really good.

2974
04:21:57,060 --> 04:22:10,060
But I cannot, I cannot just like spending four over 400, like nearly $500 for her IEMs, you know, that's, that's going to be like that.

2975
04:22:10,060 --> 04:22:12,060
That's so much, that's so much.

2976
04:22:12,060 --> 04:22:26,060
That's like the, the cost of, that's the cost of the go XLR, you know, that's a lot of money.

2977
04:22:26,060 --> 04:22:32,060
And like, I've read reviews saying like, oh, the, the cable's not great.

2978
04:22:32,060 --> 04:22:35,060
And the case is not great.

2979
04:22:35,060 --> 04:22:40,060
And I'm just like, oh, no, I can't justify it.

2980
04:22:40,060 --> 04:22:41,060
No, I can't justify it.

2981
04:22:41,060 --> 04:22:47,060
Like, I can't even justify like certain things, right?

2982
04:22:47,060 --> 04:22:52,060
There's certain things I can't just justify.

2983
04:22:52,060 --> 04:22:53,060
For that much is better.

2984
04:22:53,060 --> 04:22:54,060
I'll be great.

2985
04:22:54,060 --> 04:22:55,060
That's what I was thinking too.

2986
04:22:55,060 --> 04:22:58,060
I was like, for like over five, I knew like $500.

2987
04:22:58,060 --> 04:23:00,060
Why isn't the wire good?

2988
04:23:00,060 --> 04:23:06,060
And why isn't the case good?

2989
04:23:06,060 --> 04:23:20,060
You know, the ones that I bought though are called open audio, which pro, but this one's the DSP version.

2990
04:23:21,060 --> 04:23:28,060
I've honestly only got it because it was pink.

2991
04:23:28,060 --> 04:23:32,060
I honestly only got it because it was pink.

2992
04:23:32,060 --> 04:23:33,060
And it looked cute.

2993
04:23:33,060 --> 04:23:38,060
And I was like, oh, I need more cuteness in my life.

2994
04:23:38,060 --> 04:23:46,060
You know?

2995
04:23:46,060 --> 04:23:48,060
I just, I just don't know.

2996
04:23:48,060 --> 04:23:51,060
What do you mean next you should get the PS Vita version?

2997
04:23:51,060 --> 04:23:53,060
What do you mean PS Vita version?

2998
04:23:53,060 --> 04:23:57,060
I have a Vita.

2999
04:23:57,060 --> 04:24:00,060
Like it's, it's, it's a lot of money.

3000
04:24:00,060 --> 04:24:02,060
You know, it's a lot of money.

3001
04:24:02,060 --> 04:24:05,060
And I'm thinking I'm spending quite a bit.

3002
04:24:05,060 --> 04:24:14,060
Like, even though Senpai gifted me this, I'm still thinking like, oh, this is quite, quite, quite a bit.

3003
04:24:14,060 --> 04:24:24,060
Um, for, for, for, you know, like audio stuff.

3004
04:24:24,060 --> 04:24:26,060
Because it's like, what, like, what was it?

3005
04:24:26,060 --> 04:24:27,060
130?

3006
04:24:27,060 --> 04:24:29,060
Yeah, 130 Canadian.

3007
04:24:29,060 --> 04:24:37,060
So I was like, oh, well, that's not terrible.

3008
04:24:37,060 --> 04:24:43,060
But I thank you for spoiling me.

3009
04:24:44,060 --> 04:24:46,060
Oh shit.

3010
04:24:46,060 --> 04:24:49,060
I talked for like over two hours.

3011
04:24:49,060 --> 04:24:50,060
Wow.

3012
04:24:50,060 --> 04:24:51,060
I'm such a yapper.

3013
04:24:51,060 --> 04:24:53,060
God, I need to shut up.

3014
04:24:53,060 --> 04:25:08,060
I always, I always feel bad for like yapping all the time.

3015
04:25:08,060 --> 04:25:13,060
It was, it was, uh, like in IRL.

3016
04:25:13,060 --> 04:25:14,060
Let's say IRL.

3017
04:25:14,060 --> 04:25:18,060
Even though I know this is real and you are all real.

3018
04:25:18,060 --> 04:25:26,060
Um, but like, I've been told a lot of my entire life that like, oh, I'm talking too much.

3019
04:25:26,060 --> 04:25:31,060
I should shut up, you know?

3020
04:25:31,060 --> 04:25:32,060
You know what I mean?

3021
04:25:32,060 --> 04:25:47,060
I've, now that nobody's stopping me, I feel that sense of guilt, I guess.

3022
04:25:47,060 --> 04:25:54,060
I feel like I, I've taken your time, your time by over talking.

3023
04:25:54,060 --> 04:26:01,060
And that's, that's still in me, you know, that's still in me.

3024
04:26:01,060 --> 04:26:12,060
That's still in me because I'm so very used to people being like, stop or, uh, you know, wrap it up.

3025
04:26:12,060 --> 04:26:14,060
So that's why I always apologize.

3026
04:26:14,060 --> 04:26:26,060
I'm like, oh shit, I didn't realize I talked so damn much.

3027
04:26:26,060 --> 04:26:42,060
So that's why I was like, oh, oh, I feel bad.

3028
04:26:42,060 --> 04:26:44,060
I feel bad because I don't know.

3029
04:26:44,060 --> 04:26:45,060
Have you?

3030
04:26:45,060 --> 04:26:46,060
Senpai!

3031
04:26:46,060 --> 04:26:48,060
Thank you for the super chat.

3032
04:26:48,060 --> 04:26:50,060
Woo, thank you D-Man.

3033
04:26:50,060 --> 04:26:54,060
I'd rather hear you yapping to sleep TVH.

3034
04:26:54,060 --> 04:26:55,060
So silly.

3035
04:26:56,060 --> 04:26:58,060
But I, I don't know.

3036
04:26:58,060 --> 04:27:02,060
I feel like it's a, it's a, it's a tism thing.

3037
04:27:02,060 --> 04:27:17,060
It's a tism thing where people have been used to being like telling, telling you that you're like yapping too much or you're talking too much or you're over explaining things, you know?

3038
04:27:17,060 --> 04:27:22,060
And now that, you know, the plug is not there, all social cues gone.

3039
04:27:23,060 --> 04:27:37,060
The, the, the plug of like someone telling you, wrap it up or like, please, uh, please keep it short or, uh, I have to go now kind of thing is that social cues out the window.

3040
04:27:39,060 --> 04:27:40,060
It's gone.

3041
04:27:40,060 --> 04:28:07,060
So, yeah, I'm just like, oh, but it's still in me because, you know, I've learned to read a bit of body language to tell, to tell when someone is like done with me and I need to wrap it up.

3042
04:28:08,060 --> 04:28:14,060
But now, but I'm talking to step by, I don't have those visual cues, so I just keep talking.

3043
04:28:19,060 --> 04:28:28,060
So I just keep talking and then I'm like, oh, thank God, chat doesn't have a body.

3044
04:28:28,060 --> 04:28:29,060
It's, it's true.

3045
04:28:29,060 --> 04:28:30,060
It's true.

3046
04:28:30,060 --> 04:28:39,060
Like you, it's, it's so interesting now that, now that like, you know, the limiter is off.

3047
04:28:40,060 --> 04:28:46,060
You don't have any social cues to like, would you learn how to like get, get them, right?

3048
04:28:46,060 --> 04:28:47,060
Yeah.

3049
04:28:48,060 --> 04:28:50,060
Cole, hi, are you acoustic?

3050
04:28:50,060 --> 04:28:51,060
Yeah.

3051
04:28:51,060 --> 04:28:52,060
Yeah.

3052
04:29:00,060 --> 04:29:10,060
It was just, we need a Mercy's at that sooner.

3053
04:29:11,060 --> 04:29:13,060
An unlimited all you can.

3054
04:29:13,060 --> 04:29:14,060
Yeah.

3055
04:29:14,060 --> 04:29:15,060
I don't think I have stopped.

3056
04:29:15,060 --> 04:29:17,060
Yeah, I think I could get for six hours.

3057
04:29:20,060 --> 04:29:23,060
I can't believe Mercy is artistic.

3058
04:29:26,060 --> 04:29:27,060
Please forgive me.

3059
04:29:27,060 --> 04:29:28,060
I'm a little acoustic.

3060
04:29:33,060 --> 04:29:34,060
Good.

3061
04:29:34,060 --> 04:29:35,060
Only two more hours.

3062
04:29:39,060 --> 04:29:40,060
Just like mummy.

3063
04:29:41,060 --> 04:29:47,060
I think that's what I think she told the story that like the reason one of the biggest reasons

3064
04:29:47,060 --> 04:29:55,060
why I got in was because it was like, oh, she had a section in the audition that said,

3065
04:29:55,060 --> 04:29:57,060
oh, what would you like us?

3066
04:29:57,060 --> 04:29:59,060
Is there anything else to you?

3067
04:29:59,060 --> 04:30:01,060
You, you would like us to know.

3068
04:30:01,060 --> 04:30:06,060
And I said, I, I am on the spectrum.

3069
04:30:16,060 --> 04:30:21,060
And that's like one of the reasons, one of the main reasons why.

3070
04:30:22,060 --> 04:30:35,060
She go, yeah, I didn't think, I didn't think, I didn't think it was much, right?

3071
04:30:35,060 --> 04:30:38,060
I didn't think I was like, oh, maybe they should know.

3072
04:30:40,060 --> 04:30:44,060
Oh, and then I also put in, oh, by the way, I live with my parents.

3073
04:30:48,060 --> 04:30:49,060
I'm not joking.

3074
04:30:49,060 --> 04:30:51,060
That's what I really did.

3075
04:30:51,060 --> 04:30:53,060
I was like, oh, and I live with my parents.

3076
04:30:56,060 --> 04:31:04,060
It was, it was definitely like a, oh, well, it was, I was, I definitely took off.

3077
04:31:04,060 --> 04:31:16,060
This is what I did different this time for this audition was I kind of just through almost,

3078
04:31:16,060 --> 04:31:20,060
almost through professionalism out the window.

3079
04:31:25,060 --> 04:31:27,060
I almost threw it out of the window.

3080
04:31:29,060 --> 04:31:30,060
Almost.

3081
04:31:30,060 --> 04:31:33,060
I put a little ha ha in between.

3082
04:31:33,060 --> 04:31:51,060
I feel like it depends on like, I change my tone based off of who I'm talking to.

3083
04:31:51,060 --> 04:32:01,060
So if someone, like if I, if I find a company a little, a little very like, you know, no,

3084
04:32:02,060 --> 04:32:07,060
very, very professional, I will also mirror them, right?

3085
04:32:10,060 --> 04:32:12,060
I will mirror them.

3086
04:32:12,060 --> 04:32:24,060
And, you know, I was watching scrawny streams talking about like what you want in a company and stuff.

3087
04:32:24,060 --> 04:32:29,060
And, you know, a lot of the things that she valued, I valued a lot.

3088
04:32:29,060 --> 04:32:30,060
And it just like clicked.

3089
04:32:30,060 --> 04:32:31,060
It just clicked.

3090
04:32:31,060 --> 04:32:33,060
And I was like, I want to join this company.

3091
04:32:35,060 --> 04:32:42,060
So that's why I always say like, you know, her, her like dreams resonated with me.

3092
04:32:42,060 --> 04:32:43,060
And I really did.

3093
04:32:43,060 --> 04:32:44,060
Cause like, I just clicked.

3094
04:32:44,060 --> 04:32:45,060
I was like, I agree.

3095
04:32:45,060 --> 04:32:46,060
I agree.

3096
04:32:46,060 --> 04:32:47,060
I agree.

3097
04:32:47,060 --> 04:32:48,060
The entire time I was like, I agree.

3098
04:32:48,060 --> 04:32:49,060
I agree.

3099
04:32:49,060 --> 04:32:50,060
I agree.

3100
04:32:51,060 --> 04:33:06,060
Like, and so I felt that there was a bit of like, you know, the, the professional, professional,

3101
04:33:06,060 --> 04:33:14,060
professionalism, professionalism, that the extreme professionalism that wasn't there.

3102
04:33:14,060 --> 04:33:19,060
So I felt like I could be like, kind of like, you know, like business casual.

3103
04:33:21,060 --> 04:33:22,060
I thought that makes sense.

3104
04:33:22,060 --> 04:33:23,060
It felt like destiny.

3105
04:33:23,060 --> 04:33:31,060
Like honestly, it did feel like destiny because everything lined up correctly.

3106
04:33:37,060 --> 04:33:41,060
Was there a time where you were like, I don't agree in the interview?

3107
04:33:41,060 --> 04:33:42,060
Oh.

3108
04:33:44,060 --> 04:33:48,060
Um, I didn't really get an interview.

3109
04:33:52,060 --> 04:33:58,060
I don't know about the other girls, but personally I was late.

3110
04:33:58,060 --> 04:33:59,060
I was late.

3111
04:33:59,060 --> 04:34:01,060
So I, I thought I didn't get in.

3112
04:34:01,060 --> 04:34:03,060
I thought I didn't get in.

3113
04:34:03,060 --> 04:34:04,060
Right.

3114
04:34:04,060 --> 04:34:05,060
I did.

3115
04:34:05,060 --> 04:34:12,060
I thought I failed even, even though the alert watched my audition video.

3116
04:34:14,060 --> 04:34:15,060
Quite a bit.

3117
04:34:15,060 --> 04:34:17,060
Quite a bit.

3118
04:34:17,060 --> 04:34:22,060
I was like, oh man.

3119
04:34:22,060 --> 04:34:39,060
Oh, well, um, you were like, no, no, they were, they contact, they contacted me late.

3120
04:34:39,060 --> 04:34:46,060
So I, I really thought I didn't get in.

3121
04:34:46,060 --> 04:34:49,060
And, but they watched my video quite a bit.

3122
04:34:49,060 --> 04:34:54,060
Like my audition video was like, watched so much.

3123
04:34:54,060 --> 04:35:01,060
And at the time I was like, oh, well, they must have been interested in me.

3124
04:35:01,060 --> 04:35:20,060
So I'm going to send a follow-up email just to be like, hey, um, hey, what's, what's, uh,

3125
04:35:20,060 --> 04:35:23,060
what, hey, I noticed you watched me quite a bit.

3126
04:35:23,060 --> 04:35:33,060
I was wondering, uh, where I can improve so I can get a, um, so I can get to the next step of the audition next time I apply.

3127
04:35:33,060 --> 04:35:43,060
I wouldn't have done that if I, uh, if they didn't watch me that much.

3128
04:35:43,060 --> 04:35:44,060
Right.

3129
04:35:44,060 --> 04:35:51,060
Like if I only got, if I got zero views on like my, my audition video, I'd be like, no, I'm not going to follow up.

3130
04:35:51,060 --> 04:35:52,060
Right.

3131
04:35:52,060 --> 04:35:59,060
But like it was quite a bit, quite a, quite a, quite a large number of views.

3132
04:35:59,060 --> 04:36:02,060
And so I, you know, I sent it off.

3133
04:36:02,060 --> 04:36:06,060
And then I was like, oh, okay, well, time to move on.

3134
04:36:06,060 --> 04:36:20,060
And, uh, and I got an email back like a few days later saying, oh my gosh, sorry, uh,

3135
04:36:20,060 --> 04:36:22,060
for, we got really busy.

3136
04:36:22,060 --> 04:36:24,060
Uh, do you have time for an interview?

3137
04:36:24,060 --> 04:36:31,060
And then I screamed when I got the email.

3138
04:36:31,060 --> 04:36:33,060
I screamed when I got the email.

3139
04:36:33,060 --> 04:36:36,060
And then when I did, I went in for the interview.

3140
04:36:36,060 --> 04:36:37,060
It wasn't really an interview.

3141
04:36:37,060 --> 04:36:43,060
It was more like a, sorry, we're late.

3142
04:36:43,060 --> 04:36:44,060
Hey, sorry, we're late.

3143
04:36:44,060 --> 04:36:49,060
Here's the rundown.

3144
04:36:49,060 --> 04:37:00,060
And, uh,

3145
04:37:00,060 --> 04:37:02,060
and I was like, oh yeah.

3146
04:37:02,060 --> 04:37:07,060
But I was like, I screamed so hard, I was coughing the entire time.

3147
04:37:07,060 --> 04:37:08,060
I was coughing the entire time.

3148
04:37:08,060 --> 04:37:18,060
I was like, oh, it was like, it was like that the entire time I was like, oh my gosh.

3149
04:37:18,060 --> 04:37:20,060
Cause I screamed so hard when I got the email.

3150
04:37:20,060 --> 04:37:26,060
And then I like instantly, they're like, here, uh, here's the details for the interview.

3151
04:37:26,060 --> 04:37:29,060
Uh, let us know what time when you're ready.

3152
04:37:29,060 --> 04:37:37,060
And I'm like, I'm here.

3153
04:37:37,060 --> 04:37:43,060
So I, I let up like the biggest scream ever cause I didn't think that would work.

3154
04:37:43,060 --> 04:37:46,060
And they're like, yeah, we were going to contact you.

3155
04:37:46,060 --> 04:37:48,060
Um, unfortunately we got really busy.

3156
04:37:48,060 --> 04:37:50,060
Uh, sorry, we're late.

3157
04:37:50,060 --> 04:37:56,060
Uh, here's, here's like, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3158
04:37:56,060 --> 04:37:59,060
Here's the contract.

3159
04:37:59,060 --> 04:38:06,060
Okay.

3160
04:38:06,060 --> 04:38:07,060
Sorry.

3161
04:38:07,060 --> 04:38:08,060
Sorry about that.

3162
04:38:08,060 --> 04:38:11,060
Sorry about that.

3163
04:38:11,060 --> 04:38:12,060
That's the way to do it.

3164
04:38:12,060 --> 04:38:14,060
Hello Lauren.

3165
04:38:14,060 --> 04:38:19,060
But yeah, that's, that's what, that's what happened.

3166
04:38:19,060 --> 04:38:26,060
And then I got in and I'm a little nervous.

3167
04:38:26,060 --> 04:38:40,060
I was a little nervous because I, I was, I was really nervous because you know, like,

3168
04:38:40,060 --> 04:38:41,060
I was the late comer.

3169
04:38:41,060 --> 04:38:45,060
I was, I was the, I, I believe I was the last one to join.

3170
04:38:45,060 --> 04:38:46,060
Yeah.

3171
04:38:46,060 --> 04:38:53,060
I believe I was the, the last one to join, uh, the, the indulge.

3172
04:38:53,060 --> 04:38:59,060
So I was the last to join everyone.

3173
04:38:59,060 --> 04:39:07,060
So I was, I was really nervous cause, uh, by that time it was quite, quite a bit past

3174
04:39:07,060 --> 04:39:10,060
the date and they're like, oh my gosh, we're, we're so sorry.

3175
04:39:10,060 --> 04:39:12,060
Uh, we didn't contact you.

3176
04:39:12,060 --> 04:39:13,060
We were so busy.

3177
04:39:13,060 --> 04:39:14,060
Blah, blah, blah.

3178
04:39:14,060 --> 04:39:15,060
Yeah.

3179
04:39:15,060 --> 04:39:18,060
I'm glad we have you as our Kohai.

3180
04:39:18,060 --> 04:39:19,060
Kohai.

3181
04:39:19,060 --> 04:39:20,060
Thank you.

3182
04:39:20,060 --> 04:39:23,060
Kisato daijuu for the 20.

3183
04:39:23,060 --> 04:39:33,060
For the 20 super.

3184
04:39:33,060 --> 04:39:35,060
Also same as the last one to join.

3185
04:39:35,060 --> 04:39:36,060
Yeah.

3186
04:39:36,060 --> 04:39:38,060
It's kind of, it's kind of wild, right?

3187
04:39:38,060 --> 04:39:42,060
But it was like past the, the time that was estimated.

3188
04:39:42,060 --> 04:39:47,060
It was like, oh, you know, uh, here's the time that, you know, you'll expect emails.

3189
04:39:47,060 --> 04:39:50,060
And I just thought, oh, bye.

3190
04:39:50,060 --> 04:39:51,060
Oh, wow.

3191
04:39:51,060 --> 04:39:52,060
Shit.

3192
04:39:52,060 --> 04:39:53,060
Bye.

3193
04:39:53,060 --> 04:39:54,060
I thought, I thought I didn't get in.

3194
04:39:54,060 --> 04:39:58,060
So yeah, I ended up getting in and I was really happy.

3195
04:39:58,060 --> 04:40:02,060
And Strani said that she loved my audition video because she thought it was so funny.

3196
04:40:02,060 --> 04:40:08,060
She thought it was so funny and that it was really entertaining and made her laugh a lot.

3197
04:40:08,060 --> 04:40:18,060
And so I was like, oh, yay.

3198
04:40:18,060 --> 04:40:19,060
I don't mind though.

3199
04:40:19,060 --> 04:40:20,060
I don't mind.

3200
04:40:20,060 --> 04:40:21,060
I'm here now.

3201
04:40:21,060 --> 04:40:25,060
It doesn't matter.

3202
04:40:25,060 --> 04:40:26,060
It doesn't matter.

3203
04:40:26,060 --> 04:40:30,060
I'm going to work hard so that Strani can be proud of me.

3204
04:40:30,060 --> 04:40:42,060
So I can be a good daughter.

3205
04:40:42,060 --> 04:40:44,060
Honestly, you are a wonderful VTuber.

3206
04:40:44,060 --> 04:40:45,060
Thank you.

3207
04:40:45,060 --> 04:40:47,060
It is years of experience.

3208
04:40:47,060 --> 04:40:53,060
I don't talk about my past life, but I will talk about my past life experiences.

3209
04:40:53,060 --> 04:41:05,060
So that it kind of gives you a timeline of how long I've been doing this for.

3210
04:41:05,060 --> 04:41:15,060
So I feel happy that maybe you don't have to hide your past life, but it provides context for me.

3211
04:41:15,060 --> 04:41:19,060
You know?

3212
04:41:19,060 --> 04:41:24,060
So, yeah.

3213
04:41:24,060 --> 04:41:31,060
So yeah, those who know, you know, but let's keep it a secret between you and me.

3214
04:41:31,060 --> 04:41:33,060
I'm different with your past experience than now.

3215
04:41:33,060 --> 04:41:37,060
It's the same with Lude on the side.

3216
04:41:37,060 --> 04:41:48,060
I have more help because I was a one, you know, I was only like one person.

3217
04:41:48,060 --> 04:42:00,060
I was only one person.

3218
04:42:00,060 --> 04:42:08,060
I was only one person and a lot of it was really hard because I wouldn't know a lot of things, right?

3219
04:42:08,060 --> 04:42:17,060
And I don't have now, now that I'm here, people, people are more willing to talk to me.

3220
04:42:17,060 --> 04:42:23,060
So that's something that's very different.

3221
04:42:23,060 --> 04:42:32,060
I don't feel like, you know, I have to...

3222
04:42:32,060 --> 04:42:38,060
I don't have to force myself to do everything, you know?

3223
04:42:38,060 --> 04:42:48,060
And like, I don't have to force myself to do everything and I don't have to try as hard, you know?

3224
04:42:48,060 --> 04:42:49,060
Yeah.

3225
04:42:49,060 --> 04:43:03,060
And I guess like, this is like a mixed bag, but like, I don't have to feel uncomfortable, I guess.

3226
04:43:04,060 --> 04:43:11,060
Because like now I have people to help me with things.

3227
04:43:11,060 --> 04:43:23,060
Because, you know, it would be uncomfortable if I have to like address something in the community

3228
04:43:23,060 --> 04:43:27,060
and be like, okay, I have to talk about this because this has been bothering me,

3229
04:43:27,060 --> 04:43:32,060
but now I can just go to management and say, this has been bothering me, can you deal with it?

3230
04:43:33,060 --> 04:43:49,060
That's like, that's like, I feel like that's something that, you know, I didn't have, right?

3231
04:43:49,060 --> 04:43:52,060
I didn't have.

3232
04:43:52,060 --> 04:44:05,060
And I guess like, the things that are different is that it's just that I have help now.

3233
04:44:05,060 --> 04:44:19,060
I have help now and that's really, really great because, you know, being a one-man show the entire time is really exhausting.

3234
04:44:19,060 --> 04:44:35,060
And I'm very grateful for like the hard work that I did, but you know, it was great to just have, you know, knowing that people are there for you.

3235
04:44:35,060 --> 04:44:38,060
Yeah.

3236
04:44:38,060 --> 04:44:40,060
I admit I am the most acel.

3237
04:44:40,060 --> 04:44:45,060
I admit I am the most acel because I am the most inexperienced.

3238
04:44:45,060 --> 04:45:00,060
But, but it's definitely kind of like a, it's not something I don't want to do.

3239
04:45:00,060 --> 04:45:01,060
Does that make sense?

3240
04:45:01,060 --> 04:45:07,060
Like people, I know that, okay, maybe not talking about this.

3241
04:45:07,060 --> 04:45:09,060
No, I'm not going to talk about it.

3242
04:45:10,060 --> 04:45:19,060
Some people might think that, that, that this isn't what I wanted.

3243
04:45:19,060 --> 04:45:23,060
And in reality, it is what I wanted.

3244
04:45:23,060 --> 04:45:35,060
Like, I spent time experimenting with, with, like not say for work stuff.

3245
04:45:35,060 --> 04:45:43,060
And I, I had to make sure my, I myself was like, do I want to do not say for work content?

3246
04:45:43,060 --> 04:45:53,060
And so I, I, I was, I was like, okay, I have to have to know now.

3247
04:45:53,060 --> 04:45:55,060
Otherwise, I'm not going to audition.

3248
04:45:55,060 --> 04:46:04,060
Otherwise, I'm not going to audition.

3249
04:46:04,060 --> 04:46:11,060
And it's going to be really, really, really rough if I, if this is not what something I want to do.

3250
04:46:11,060 --> 04:46:19,060
And so I started streaming on Fansley to make sure that it's something I want to do.

3251
04:46:20,060 --> 04:46:30,060
And when I started streaming on Fansley, it was the most, most fun I've ever had ever in VTubing.

3252
04:46:30,060 --> 04:46:31,060
Like ever.

3253
04:46:31,060 --> 04:46:32,060
It was the most fun.

3254
04:46:32,060 --> 04:46:33,060
I felt so free.

3255
04:46:33,060 --> 04:46:34,060
I had so much fun.

3256
04:46:34,060 --> 04:46:38,060
It was, it was liberating.

3257
04:46:38,060 --> 04:46:40,060
It was liberating.

3258
04:46:40,060 --> 04:46:44,060
And I honestly was like, this is so much fun.

3259
04:46:44,060 --> 04:46:54,060
All I really did was play Aerogay, but it was the most fun I've ever had, like ever.

3260
04:46:54,060 --> 04:46:59,060
And then I started voice of doing the voices in the Aerogay.

3261
04:46:59,060 --> 04:47:02,060
And then I had lots of fun doing that.

3262
04:47:02,060 --> 04:47:06,060
And I did this continuously for like months.

3263
04:47:06,060 --> 04:47:07,060
Okay.

3264
04:47:07,060 --> 04:47:09,060
I did this continuously for months.

3265
04:47:09,060 --> 04:47:21,060
And then I thought, and then I, that was when I realized, yeah, I want to do this.

3266
04:47:21,060 --> 04:47:25,060
Yeah, I want to do this.

3267
04:47:25,060 --> 04:47:29,060
So that's why I applied.

3268
04:47:29,060 --> 04:47:36,060
Otherwise I wouldn't have applied at all if I wasn't comfortable with like not safer work stuff.

3269
04:47:36,060 --> 04:47:53,060
But like admittingly, most of my life, I was like most of my VTubing career as an indie has been, has been, what do you call it?

3270
04:47:53,060 --> 04:47:58,060
Has been very say so.

3271
04:47:58,060 --> 04:48:03,060
So I guess that's how it is.

3272
04:48:03,060 --> 04:48:15,060
I'm also a little bit, I'm also a little bit, as my senpai call it, pawn.

3273
04:48:15,060 --> 04:48:20,060
So there's a lot of things I don't know.

3274
04:48:20,060 --> 04:48:26,060
So there's some things I don't understand or I don't, I just, I'm just very naive about it, right?

3275
04:48:26,060 --> 04:48:35,060
So I was just like, oh.

3276
04:48:35,060 --> 04:48:41,060
So it's one of those things where it's just like, I don't get it.

3277
04:48:41,060 --> 04:48:47,060
Like, you know, like sometimes, you know, whoosh, the joke goes over my head.

3278
04:48:47,060 --> 04:48:52,060
Or, oh, that was supposed to be like a very saucy thing.

3279
04:48:52,060 --> 04:48:59,060
Whoops, I didn't get it.

3280
04:48:59,060 --> 04:49:01,060
Yeah, it really is.

3281
04:49:01,060 --> 04:49:08,060
It was just like, it's just me being kind of like an, an airhead, right?

3282
04:49:08,060 --> 04:49:12,060
How do you feel when VR lore gets a second gen and you're officially a senpai?

3283
04:49:12,060 --> 04:49:14,060
That's a year from now.

3284
04:49:14,060 --> 04:49:18,060
I don't want to think about that, that's a year from now.

3285
04:49:19,060 --> 04:49:22,060
At least a year from now, so.

3286
04:49:22,060 --> 04:49:28,060
Yeah, so a part of me is still pure, but I'm solely getting corrupted.

3287
04:49:28,060 --> 04:49:36,060
I'm gonna take my time though, so.

3288
04:49:36,060 --> 04:49:38,060
So I'm still gonna take my time.

3289
04:49:38,060 --> 04:49:42,060
Sorry about that, like, it's a year from now, I don't want to really think about it.

3290
04:49:42,060 --> 04:49:51,060
I'm still adjusting to my role.

3291
04:49:51,060 --> 04:49:57,060
So yeah, it is literally probably a corruption arc for me.

3292
04:49:57,060 --> 04:50:05,060
Don't get me wrong though, I am not very pure because I do play, like, Aerogay.

3293
04:50:05,060 --> 04:50:08,060
And I do, like, read Dojins.

3294
04:50:08,060 --> 04:50:16,060
And I do read, like, you know, saucy, saucy, mong, mangols, manga, right?

3295
04:50:16,060 --> 04:50:31,060
Um, so I'm not, like, fully innocent and I will, I will, like, have my fun with it, but I don't really, uh...

3296
04:50:32,060 --> 04:50:38,060
I don't really, what's the word?

3297
04:50:38,060 --> 04:50:44,060
I don't, there's still a lot of stuff that I'm just, like, oh?

3298
04:50:44,060 --> 04:50:57,060
I'm only, yeah, it's, like, intellectual, in the sheets, zero experience in the sheets.

3299
04:50:57,060 --> 04:50:59,060
You wanna leak any numbers?

3300
04:50:59,060 --> 04:51:04,060
Um...

3301
04:51:04,060 --> 04:51:09,060
Stay by me side M is the title of my favorite one.

3302
04:51:09,060 --> 04:51:10,060
Academic DJ.

3303
04:51:10,060 --> 04:51:20,060
It's true though, it's true, I am an academic DJ because I did study and I did write a paper on...

3304
04:51:20,060 --> 04:51:23,060
Oh shit, I should have been, I should have been, like, censoring myself.

3305
04:51:23,060 --> 04:51:26,060
We'll start now, on f*** time.

3306
04:51:30,060 --> 04:51:34,060
Stay by me side B, I think, or is it side M?

3307
04:51:34,060 --> 04:51:37,060
I don't remember, whatever.

3308
04:51:37,060 --> 04:51:42,060
Stay by me side B, or side M, I don't remember.

3309
04:51:48,060 --> 04:51:51,060
It's a very cute one, it's a very cute one.

3310
04:51:52,060 --> 04:51:58,060
I like, it's, like, an alternate, there's, like, a main storyline, and then I like the alternate storyline.

3311
04:51:58,060 --> 04:52:01,060
That was my, my favorite because I thought it was very sweet.

3312
04:52:01,060 --> 04:52:05,060
Okay, yeah, I like vanilla, sorry.

3313
04:52:05,060 --> 04:52:08,060
It was a happy ending, right, you know?

3314
04:52:08,060 --> 04:52:12,060
Like, marriage!

3315
04:52:12,060 --> 04:52:14,060
Marriage!

3316
04:52:14,060 --> 04:52:16,060
And I'm like, oh, that's so sweet!

3317
04:52:21,060 --> 04:52:28,060
I didn't like the, the main one because I was like, oh, so it's not for me.

3318
04:52:33,060 --> 04:52:37,060
I was like, oh, they're married and they're having their, like, you know...

3319
04:52:37,060 --> 04:52:39,060
It's, it's, it's cute!

3320
04:52:39,060 --> 04:52:43,060
I like those, I like the cute stuff, I also really like the very violent stuff.

3321
04:52:43,060 --> 04:52:48,060
Not on real people, but like the violent stuff, I'm just like, huh, huh, huh, huh.

3322
04:52:48,060 --> 04:52:51,060
A lot of great story, a lot of great horror story.

3323
04:52:56,060 --> 04:52:58,060
That was something horrible, no!

3324
04:52:58,060 --> 04:52:59,060
What?

3325
04:53:06,060 --> 04:53:10,060
Like, there's like one that I really like, um, it's about dolls?

3326
04:53:10,060 --> 04:53:14,060
Like, making people into dolls, and that's all I'm gonna tell you.

3327
04:53:15,060 --> 04:53:18,060
I really like that one for the story.

3328
04:53:18,060 --> 04:53:22,060
There's another one that I really liked, it's a part of a fairy tale series,

3329
04:53:22,060 --> 04:53:27,060
that it's kind of like very, very, uh, creepy, creepy type of folklore

3330
04:53:27,060 --> 04:53:33,060
with a little bit of, uh, arrow in it, right?

3331
04:53:33,060 --> 04:53:36,060
For the start, no, I'm serious, it was for the story!

3332
04:53:36,060 --> 04:53:37,060
Sorry!

3333
04:53:42,060 --> 04:53:43,060
Uh...

3334
04:53:43,060 --> 04:53:46,060
It was good, it was like really good.

3335
04:53:47,060 --> 04:53:49,060
Like, it was, it was...

3336
04:53:49,060 --> 04:53:53,060
It was like lots of world-building, and like, it was, it was great!

3337
04:53:53,060 --> 04:53:56,060
That was great!

3338
04:53:57,060 --> 04:53:59,060
Ha, ha, ha!

3339
04:54:05,060 --> 04:54:12,060
No, honestly, it was like, uh, it was like, there was a continuation of it, so, like, uh...

3340
04:54:12,060 --> 04:54:15,060
Okay, I'll tell you the plot, the safer work plot.

3341
04:54:15,060 --> 04:54:24,060
This girl goes to pick up doll clothes, I think she was very obsessed with dolls.

3342
04:54:24,060 --> 04:54:33,060
And, whoop-de-doo, the doll, the doll shop owner is actually a serial killer.

3343
04:54:33,060 --> 04:54:35,060
That's the story!

3344
04:54:39,060 --> 04:54:41,060
That's the story.

3345
04:54:47,060 --> 04:54:51,060
That's, that's the one, I thought that one was really good.

3346
04:54:55,060 --> 04:55:00,060
And then, I don't want to give you spoilers, because there's a lot of twists and turns in that one,

3347
04:55:00,060 --> 04:55:06,060
and I think it's very enjoyable if you kind of read it as like, like a horror,

3348
04:55:06,060 --> 04:55:08,060
and I'm just like, yeah, that's good.

3349
04:55:17,060 --> 04:55:23,060
That's like the TLDR, literally the TLDR of like, the plot that I like.

3350
04:55:23,060 --> 04:55:26,060
We need the numbers, Mercy, I don't know the numbers!

3351
04:55:32,060 --> 04:55:36,060
Do you think of it as playing or reading in a, a VN?

3352
04:55:36,060 --> 04:55:39,060
Like, mangles or dojins? No.

3353
04:55:39,060 --> 04:55:42,060
It's a completely different medium!

3354
04:55:45,060 --> 04:55:48,060
Sounds like a 2013 creepypastas plot.

3355
04:55:48,060 --> 04:55:51,060
It was, it's much better than how I'm explaining it.

3356
04:55:54,060 --> 04:55:58,060
It's much better than how I'm explaining it.

3357
04:56:01,060 --> 04:56:03,060
A book club stream sounds neat.

3358
04:56:06,060 --> 04:56:10,060
Honestly, it's, it's probably something that's, um,

3359
04:56:13,060 --> 04:56:16,060
the shop owner is a harvester, yeah.

3360
04:56:18,060 --> 04:56:22,060
How do you feel about fan-made work of Susie novels?

3361
04:56:24,060 --> 04:56:28,060
Like, dojinshi?

3362
04:56:28,060 --> 04:56:30,060
Uh, doini?

3363
04:56:31,060 --> 04:56:33,060
What do you mean?

3364
04:56:38,060 --> 04:56:40,060
Like, like, fan-work?

3365
04:56:41,060 --> 04:56:42,060
Great.

3366
04:56:44,060 --> 04:56:46,060
Fan-work, great!

3367
04:56:46,060 --> 04:56:48,060
Ha ha ha!

3368
04:56:51,060 --> 04:56:55,060
Like, if, I don't know, like, I read a,

3369
04:56:57,060 --> 04:56:59,060
I read a K-On!

3370
04:57:01,060 --> 04:57:03,060
I read a K-On one!

3371
04:57:04,060 --> 04:57:05,060
It was great!

3372
04:57:05,060 --> 04:57:07,060
I think everyone knows it!

3373
04:57:11,060 --> 04:57:14,060
I think it's called, like, This Is It or Something?

3374
04:57:14,060 --> 04:57:16,060
Everyone seems to know that one.

3375
04:57:16,060 --> 04:57:19,060
It's the one where, you know, it's after,

3376
04:57:19,060 --> 04:57:22,060
it's after everything and their lives are weird.

3377
04:57:24,060 --> 04:57:26,060
Are you in trouble for posting the numbers?

3378
04:57:28,060 --> 04:57:30,060
If it's just the numbers, you should be fine.

3379
04:57:37,060 --> 04:57:39,060
Stay with me, uh, it's the other route.

3380
04:57:39,060 --> 04:57:41,060
It's the other route that I like.

3381
04:57:45,060 --> 04:57:49,060
Um, the K-On! one is the one where,

3382
04:57:49,060 --> 04:57:52,060
uh, what's her name?

3383
04:57:54,060 --> 04:57:56,060
What's her name gets...

3384
04:57:58,060 --> 04:58:00,060
What's her name, the main character girl?

3385
04:58:01,060 --> 04:58:03,060
Yeah, the one where they're all adults,

3386
04:58:03,060 --> 04:58:06,060
and I don't know, that one was very impactful for me.

3387
04:58:06,060 --> 04:58:09,060
That one actually changed, like, my view on life.

3388
04:58:09,060 --> 04:58:14,060
It's where, like, what's her name became, like, really famous,

3389
04:58:14,060 --> 04:58:19,060
and it's kind of like a written, kind of like a biography of it.

3390
04:58:26,060 --> 04:58:28,060
A kind of game that would fit you amazingly well.

3391
04:58:28,060 --> 04:58:29,060
You know, Slay the Princess?

3392
04:58:29,060 --> 04:58:31,060
Yeah, I know Slay the Princess.

3393
04:58:31,060 --> 04:58:32,060
I haven't played it, though, yet.

3394
04:58:32,060 --> 04:58:33,060
Yui, yeah.

3395
04:58:34,060 --> 04:58:38,060
Uh, it literally changed me, because at the end...

3396
04:58:38,060 --> 04:58:39,060
Okay, this is spoilers.

3397
04:58:39,060 --> 04:58:42,060
Close your ears if you don't want to hear spoilers.

3398
04:58:42,060 --> 04:58:44,060
At the end, um...

3399
04:58:51,060 --> 04:59:00,060
Azusa doesn't reach what she perceives as her dreams, right?

3400
04:59:00,060 --> 04:59:01,060
Right?

3401
04:59:02,060 --> 04:59:03,060
And...

3402
04:59:04,060 --> 04:59:05,060
But...

3403
04:59:06,060 --> 04:59:10,060
She is working at a...

3404
04:59:11,060 --> 04:59:15,060
At a music store, and is still within the industry that she wanted to.

3405
04:59:15,060 --> 04:59:19,060
And it was kind of like, she said something like, you know,

3406
04:59:19,060 --> 04:59:23,060
like, even if I didn't reach my dreams,

3407
04:59:24,060 --> 04:59:26,060
I'm still very close to it or something about it,

3408
04:59:26,060 --> 04:59:28,060
and that just, like, changed my entire life.

3409
04:59:28,060 --> 04:59:29,060
That just changed me.

3410
04:59:29,060 --> 04:59:37,060
That just, like, opened a new side, like a new vision for me, I guess.

3411
04:59:37,060 --> 04:59:42,060
Like, she still had an impact.

3412
04:59:43,060 --> 04:59:45,060
She still was like...

3413
04:59:45,060 --> 04:59:48,060
She didn't reach her dreams, but it was very close,

3414
04:59:48,060 --> 04:59:52,060
and I was like, that's a pretty fucking powerful message, right?

3415
04:59:53,060 --> 04:59:58,060
And that's where I was like,

3416
04:59:59,060 --> 05:00:05,060
oh my gosh, I can't believe this, this, like,

3417
05:00:07,060 --> 05:00:13,060
this dojin changed my trajectory of, like, how I view, like, goals,

3418
05:00:13,060 --> 05:00:18,060
like, goal settings, and, and, like, what is success?

3419
05:00:23,060 --> 05:00:27,060
I think it was called, this is it, this is it?

3420
05:00:29,060 --> 05:00:34,060
I think it was called, this is it, or this is us, or what is it, what is it, whatever?

3421
05:00:34,060 --> 05:00:38,060
Um...

3422
05:00:49,060 --> 05:00:53,060
It's like, they had, like, the cover was like,

3423
05:00:54,060 --> 05:00:59,060
Yui, I think, was in like a Michael Jackson pose.

3424
05:01:04,060 --> 05:01:28,560
That was the one that I was like, oh, I didn't think it would change, you know, the way

3425
05:01:28,560 --> 05:01:41,100
I viewed, I viewed, I viewed what goal setting was, yeah, it's the one where like everything

3426
05:01:41,100 --> 05:01:46,180
kind of went to shit, right, and they never reached their dreams or anything, and like

3427
05:01:46,180 --> 05:01:50,880
goals were like missed and stuff, but like the ending had like a bitter sweetness to

3428
05:01:50,880 --> 05:01:57,380
it, and it just changed the way I just viewed like goals and stuff, because it was something

3429
05:01:57,380 --> 05:02:03,200
that I was like, oh, you know, like, even if I don't succeed, there's a chance that I

3430
05:02:03,200 --> 05:02:11,600
could still be very close to what I wanted.

3431
05:02:11,600 --> 05:02:16,040
That was, yeah, that was what changed me.

3432
05:02:16,040 --> 05:02:17,040
I liked that one.

3433
05:02:17,040 --> 05:02:25,200
I like that, Joe Jinchi, because it was like, I don't know, it was very profound, it was

3434
05:02:25,200 --> 05:02:37,280
very profound, it really changed me, it really did change me, like I honestly at that time

3435
05:02:37,280 --> 05:02:45,800
when I read it, I was like devastated, I was devastated that I was not going to reach my

3436
05:02:45,800 --> 05:02:46,800
dreams.

3437
05:02:47,800 --> 05:02:56,000
Several years ago was a different, different goal, right, and I thought, um, I thought

3438
05:02:56,000 --> 05:03:01,120
to myself like, you know, the ending was bitter sweet, and I was like, oh, you know, like,

3439
05:03:01,120 --> 05:03:09,880
this isn't terrible, like she got through this, yeah.

3440
05:03:09,880 --> 05:03:16,400
So I, I really liked it.

3441
05:03:16,400 --> 05:03:20,200
I really liked it, because in the end, even though the message was bitter sweet, I know

3442
05:03:20,200 --> 05:03:28,160
that like, maybe it's the author's like, not, not everyone's cup of tea, but that was just

3443
05:03:28,160 --> 05:03:33,880
something that I was just like, oh, fuck, that's a very powerful message for me.

3444
05:03:33,880 --> 05:03:39,880
And I was like, oh, I have never had this experience before.

3445
05:03:39,880 --> 05:03:46,360
And I thought, you know, I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it.

3446
05:03:46,360 --> 05:04:02,600
I was satisfied in knowing that, you know, it's okay to fail.

3447
05:04:02,600 --> 05:04:08,160
The story was not very nice, I'm telling you, it's not a very nice story, but like the ending

3448
05:04:08,160 --> 05:04:15,840
just made me go, oh, it's actually very bitter sweet.

3449
05:04:15,840 --> 05:04:20,760
Oh yeah.

3450
05:04:20,760 --> 05:04:25,160
I don't remember all of it, I just remember just, it just changed the way I thought about

3451
05:04:25,160 --> 05:04:26,160
things.

3452
05:04:26,160 --> 05:04:34,480
It just changed the way I thought about it, that's it.

3453
05:04:34,480 --> 05:04:40,600
Like how I would, yeah, just changed, like, because I was punishing myself the time for

3454
05:04:40,600 --> 05:04:42,800
not meeting goals.

3455
05:04:42,800 --> 05:04:46,520
And then when I read that, I just changed, it just changed everything.

3456
05:04:46,520 --> 05:04:52,840
I just was like, even if I don't reach my dreams, like, if I keep pursuing this, I could

3457
05:04:52,840 --> 05:05:01,040
be really close, and that might be okay too.

3458
05:05:01,040 --> 05:05:08,720
Yeah, that one was good.

3459
05:05:08,720 --> 05:05:10,720
I'm tired now so far.

3460
05:05:10,720 --> 05:05:11,920
I'm tired now.

3461
05:05:11,920 --> 05:05:19,560
I wanna, I wanna rest, because, to tell you the truth, I wanna go back to my anime.

3462
05:05:19,560 --> 05:05:26,160
It's not that I'm sick of you, it's just that I'm watching a really good anime right now.

3463
05:05:26,160 --> 05:05:46,880
That I'm very interested in, it's on Netflix, it's called Grimm's Variation, it's called

3464
05:05:46,880 --> 05:05:59,080
Grimm's Variation, I like it because it's, it's interesting.

3465
05:05:59,080 --> 05:06:14,760
I have a feeling that some senpais might like Episode 2, I feel like some senpais might like

3466
05:06:14,760 --> 05:06:32,320
Episode 2, and I don't wanna spoil it, because you're gonna be like, they did the thing!

3467
05:06:32,320 --> 05:06:41,320
I think it's gonna be very entertaining, since they've all, it's the first episode

3468
05:06:41,320 --> 05:06:55,000
of Supercost Cinderella, yeah.

3469
05:06:55,000 --> 05:06:57,960
The second episode is Little Red Riding Hood.

3470
05:06:57,960 --> 05:07:07,800
It was really enjoyable to watch Little Red Riding Hood, because they have a lot of, I

3471
05:07:07,800 --> 05:07:18,480
have a lot of what do you call it, movie references, and I remember Shibi told me some senpais

3472
05:07:18,480 --> 05:07:27,160
really like a certain movie, and they make a reference to it, so I think that's gonna

3473
05:07:27,160 --> 05:07:28,160
be fun.

3474
05:07:28,160 --> 05:07:48,080
That's gonna be fun at least for senpais who watch that episode and be like, oh!

3475
05:07:48,080 --> 05:07:49,080
So I think it's funny.

3476
05:07:49,080 --> 05:07:59,800
I think it's funny, I was like, I screen shoted it instead of to, to Shibi saying, oh my

3477
05:07:59,800 --> 05:08:00,800
gosh!

3478
05:08:00,800 --> 05:08:18,920
The thing you told me about, but yeah, um, yeah, I think that's it.

3479
05:08:18,920 --> 05:08:25,840
I wanna watch it now, I'm on episode, what episode am I on?

3480
05:08:25,840 --> 05:08:31,240
I'm on episode four right now, I'm on episode four, and I want to, there's only six episodes

3481
05:08:31,240 --> 05:08:42,640
senpai, there's only six episodes, so I kinda wanna finish it, you know?

3482
05:08:42,640 --> 05:08:52,040
Percy is a closet freak, I finished the doll dojin, it was interesting, right?

3483
05:08:52,040 --> 05:08:53,040
It's interesting, right?

3484
05:08:53,040 --> 05:09:04,880
It was like, senpai, world building, it was like really good world building, and like,

3485
05:09:04,880 --> 05:09:08,800
I liked a very solid, did you read the sequel to it?

3486
05:09:08,800 --> 05:09:21,760
There's a sequel to it, which I feel like wraps it up nicely.

3487
05:09:21,760 --> 05:09:31,760
Project Haruhi blog did a good deconstruction of that K-On Dojin by the way, if they like

3488
05:09:31,760 --> 05:09:36,400
get way too into it, I might change my mind about what I view as success, and I don't

3489
05:09:36,400 --> 05:09:44,720
want that.

3490
05:09:44,720 --> 05:09:51,000
The art style changed quite a bit in the sequel, so I was like, oh, okay, I think they improved

3491
05:09:51,000 --> 05:10:01,320
quite a bit, they had the author, yeah, that was good, yeah, I'm trying to think about

3492
05:10:01,320 --> 05:10:06,120
it, I'm like, I don't think I'm that freaky, I feel like it's not something I'm into and

3493
05:10:06,680 --> 05:10:17,760
it's something that I'm just like, oh, the story was like really good, literally reading

3494
05:10:17,760 --> 05:10:25,920
it for the plot, not sarcasm, literally not sarcasm.

3495
05:10:25,920 --> 05:10:34,760
Anyways, thank you senpais for joining me today.
