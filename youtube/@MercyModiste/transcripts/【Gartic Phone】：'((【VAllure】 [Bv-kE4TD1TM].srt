1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh my god.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Smash that bell to get notifications of when we go live.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Smash that bell to get smashed.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To get smashed?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, like with alcohol or something.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, I am.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Not literally.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I can't help myself.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She loves smashing.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No Nigel Thornberry.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
She just says smashing.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Are we here?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Are we here?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, finally.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're here. I'm sorry for the mess.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, we're here.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm live now. Finally, dead game.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We, a viewer, have done the holistic approach where none of us will mute.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, you're just going to hear everything all at once.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, that's how we're all.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It just as a reminder, all donations,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
more memberships or super chats will be addressed at the end of the stream

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
when it's not an absolute cluster buck of all six of us together.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But yes, the whole premise of the power washer was I was going to do a gag

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and be like, oh, Viola isn't doing so well.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We might go bust.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We might go and put a bikini on and get clean in.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, that idea is out the window now.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So instead we're playing Gartik phone.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've never played it personally.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She be suggested it and I, her word is law.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So let's just take it away.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm taking over the company.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Shadow CEO.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay. Do you guys want to start? You ready?

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We can finally do it.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know cheating.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The guy is so chat.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't fucking cheat.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't fucking do it.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I swear it off.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How long do I have to do the sentence?

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't know.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Help me out.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Help me out.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Senpai.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't give away until it's over.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is our secret.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Senpai.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Senpai.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is funny.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Peek comedy.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Peek comedy.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't think so actually.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I know what that is.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So let me change it.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello?

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hello?

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's wrong?

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Moshi Moshi.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Moshi Moshi.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We have to draw these now.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We have to draw these now.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh my god.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh my god.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm drawing this with a mouse.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You broke that.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't see.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't cheat.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is so bad.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh no.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've never done this before.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wait.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Can I make my pen smaller or is she?

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh no.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why is he getting drunk?

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why am I drunk?

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't even know what's happening.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why are you guys screaming?

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh my god.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Holy fuck.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How much time is left in my god?

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The top right corner is the indicator.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Not the shading.

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm an artist.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm such an artist.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh yeah.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Wait.

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All you can fucking draw is me.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're all done.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wait.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can look up with a mouse.

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We need to get a witness pen.

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hold on.

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't spell.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What the fuck am I doing?

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What am I doing with that line?

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I should whip out my drawing tablet.

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's beautiful.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Better with a mouse.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's better with a mouse if it looks like hot garbage.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It looks great.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hey.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hey.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hey.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Would you?

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm done.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm done.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm done.

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's Tech say?

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can't tell you.

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, where are you going?

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
These are your items.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
100% Wood.

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Wood.

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why not?

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, this is the chat logs.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh my god.

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We need to put the chat logs in quick.

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh my god.

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, good answer.

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Chat logs?

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Little person.

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Why?

134
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You guys aren't ready for mine?

135
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's put a bit of detail.

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We need some wood detail.

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Americans always have an eagle.

138
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What the fuck?

140
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh shit.

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What's his name?

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There we go.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There you go.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What do you think?

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wait, is that an art?

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Tilly.

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Tilly.

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My gen mates are wild.

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh my god.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't know what he looks like.

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh no.

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh god.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hold on.

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wait, is she decent so far away?

155
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right.

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't know what Thorne Berry looks like.

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I had to look it up.

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm just guessing.

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm just going for it.

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why is?

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll look like this.

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Wait, I don't look like that.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Sugar.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't question this.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't question this.

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't question this.

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How do you draw?

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I hate you.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh my god.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I can't.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can't see on you.

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't see on you.

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know.

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know how to draw.

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't know how to draw anymore.

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's pretty good, right?

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't know.

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know.

179
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh my god.

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is something.

181
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Wait, hold on.

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ginger in it and there you go.

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's me.

184
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't know what.

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is awful.

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know.

188
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's draw some hair.

189
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh my god.

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh my goodness.

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Draw his horn.

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't ask questions so far.

195
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't ask questions so far.

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That is very nice.

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't know.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My little leaflings are saying I'm a tree.

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Wait, wait, no.

200
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Emi's hair is not orange.

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Is it?

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Emi's ginger.

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh my god.

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Wait, I'm ginger?

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're not.

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Really?

207
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Really?

208
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm a strawberry blonde.

209
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is this the right OG sign?

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I had my image.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What does that even say?

212
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, meow.

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh my god.

214
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Which one of you speaks Spanish?

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm 100% sure this is an OG sign.

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh lord.

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Atashi?

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What?

219
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, how am I supposed to draw that?

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Did we even have one?

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What do I look like?

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh wait, I can't even draw the fucking toilet.

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What do I even look like?

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is terrible, Unmouse.

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wait, pits is not feet.

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Pits is armpits.

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We're grabbing onto the ground for dear life.

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right, armpits.

229
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know.

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh my god.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because none of you guys know some English phrases

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
or some joking phrases.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What I'm hearing is that a lot of you guys are misinterpreting

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
whatever it is that's very funny.

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's going all over his back.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's not looking good.

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
How do you draw an angry mouth?

238
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, there we go.

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Pits is feet.

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No, I'm pretty sure it's armpits.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We need to draw.

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Pits is sweat.

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is amazing.

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What does the Walmart logo look like?

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Your armpits has become sentience.

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Walmart.

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not even going to explain to Mercy.

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh wait, don't you toilet stuff like that?

249
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh wait.

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hold on.

251
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know.

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It does make it better.

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It makes it worse.

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It makes it worse.

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It makes it worse.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I thought pits is like pits.

257
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is so fucking funny.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I think that works out.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There we go.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The radiation.

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I can't wait to see everything.

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Radiation.

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh no, wait, no, we'll get to see everything.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, we'll get to see everything.

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh my god.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll do manual.

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's going to be no voiceover.

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And then we'll be beginning from the end.

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay, let's see.

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So I said, I see with Nidals Thornberry's face saying smashing.

271
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Immigrant.

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Immigrant.

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What's going on?

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No!

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,420
You look awesome!

276
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,860
No!

277
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,260
What's going on?

278
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,040
Is that Aisey누h reputation?

279
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,300
Is that Aisey Galaxyần revolutionary?

280
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,700
It was!

281
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Oh no!

282
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,760
Why does he look all handsome?

283
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Oh boy.

284
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Oh.

285
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
You're on there.

286
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
She wanted it.

287
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
And then there's Chris Hansen.

288
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Oh my gosh.

289
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,760
And I said, she said it's going to kill me with a crash.

290
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
You know, date luck.

291
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Oh no.

292
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
It's great to deal.

293
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Oh my god.

294
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Oh my god.

295
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Oh my god.

296
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Oh my god.

297
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
I love it.

298
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
I love it.

299
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
It actually worked out.

300
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Why is it trying my best?

301
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Why does it always sound such a fat talk?

302
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
There's a pee pee.

303
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Because he loves me and he's big.

304
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
They grew up together.

305
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
They grew six times that day.

306
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Oh my god.

308
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Oh my god.

310
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Oh my gosh.

311
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
It is feet.

312
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Oh my gosh.

313
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
It is feet.

314
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
I don't like how her feet is actual teeth.

315
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
I know.

316
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
I like that.

317
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
I like that.

318
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
I never wrote stinky peats.

319
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Which is feet.

320
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
But like.

321
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
And then she drew pits.

322
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
I drew myself in an armpit.

323
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
Because I thought it was.

324
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
So it was feet.

325
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
And not armpits.

326
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
She's screaming so loud.

327
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Sorry.

328
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
The spot is over.

329
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Okay.

330
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
I got it from AC.

331
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Very good artist.

332
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
I got it from AC.

333
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Don't ask me what this is.

334
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
What does that even mean?

335
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
When your job is a poo.

336
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
So when your poo hits your prostate on the way out.

337
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Oh I thought it was Javi.

338
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Javi's a poo.

339
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
I draw this.

340
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
You see me sucking?

341
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
I mean suckers don't live hot too.

342
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Oh wait.

343
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Is she giving a blow job?

344
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
That's what it looks like.

345
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
That's what it looks like to me.

346
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Oh my gosh.

347
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
I love the drill.

348
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
This is so fucking good.

349
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Oh boy.

350
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
It's over.

351
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
It's over.

352
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Oh my gosh.

353
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Okay.

354
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
That's cute.

355
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
I love that.

356
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Oh it's not a cat.

357
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
It's not a cat.

358
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
It's a winky face.

359
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Okay it's a winky face.

360
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I was like what is miawa?

361
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
So I was like who is this guy?

362
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
We are so good.

363
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
This is a cat.

364
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
That's good.

365
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
That's good.

366
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,760
I love that.

367
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Okay this makes sense.

368
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
This makes sense of what on earth we were drawing.

369
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Because I just chucked out

370
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
and like that's items on the shelves.

371
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I worked around.

372
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Oh this is a good diaper.

373
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
I see understood me.

374
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Oh my god.

375
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
I snored in my teeth or my nose.

376
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
I snored in my teeth or my nose.

377
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
It's painful it hurts.

378
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
I can't.

379
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I can't.

380
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I had to do the toilet stall gap.

381
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Because that's all I see about

382
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
when I see American memes.

383
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Oh the toilet stall.

384
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
The toilet gap is so big.

385
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
You can literally look at people's eyes through it.

386
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,760
It went the wrong way.

387
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Oh no.

388
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,760
We have them closed because you know it's a private time

389
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
and you're very vulnerable taking a big job.

390
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
So yeah it's actually closed everywhere else in the planet.

391
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Oh you're so lucky.

392
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Yeah.

393
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I had people peeking at me in high school

394
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
through the stalls and I'm like

395
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
me too.

396
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Oh no.

397
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Is there a DC?

398
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Is there a check?

399
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Is there a DC check?

400
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Are you in the lobby?

401
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Do you need to reload the lobby?

402
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
It's gonna do it on its own usually.

403
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
No I'm gone.

404
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
The link should be in the discord.

405
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.

406
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
They'll see everything.

407
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
I see all of our naughty photos

408
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
we just send to each other.

409
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
It's real.

410
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
It's mostly memes.

411
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
It's weird.

412
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Any memes?

413
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
I mean to be fair we did share

414
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
on that page.

415
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
We did share some

416
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
lucky nudes of ours.

417
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
They've seen my titties.

418
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,760
I started roleplaying as the girls

419
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,760
with my nudes so I was like

420
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
this is what Evie would do.

421
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
This is what Evie would do.

422
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Our discord is so chaotic.

423
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
Okay.

424
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Real though.

425
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
But also I did snort out

426
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
my tea.

427
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.

428
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Oh no.

429
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
There's your snort and tea.

430
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
This is what you hate to talk about.

431
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
It's a stosterone.

432
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
It hurts so much.

433
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Yeah.

434
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
I'm getting

435
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,760
pain.

436
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,760
I push

437
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
my ears.

438
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
I'm getting another heart beat

439
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
right now every time she talks.

440
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Oh no.

441
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Our nudes are eye-prone nudes.

442
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
I'm not a man.

443
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
And my face turned out like that.

444
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Oopsie.

445
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
How does she talk like this?

446
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
I don't know.

447
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Oopsie.

448
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
I feel like Azera

449
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
can do a really good Jennifer Coolidge impression.

450
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Me too.

451
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Jennifer Coolidge.

452
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Did it.

453
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
I don't know what Jennifer Coolidge

454
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
is impression.

455
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Wait you don't know Jennifer Coolidge.

456
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Jennifer Coolidge.

457
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Oh.

458
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm going to switch back to you.

459
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Oh my god.

460
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Oh my god.

461
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Jennifer Coolidge.

462
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Are you kidding me?

463
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Are you kidding me?

464
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Are you kidding me?

465
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Why are we opening our gap for the way

466
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
you raise your voice?

467
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Azura.

468
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Azura.

469
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Click that link in the general

470
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,760
discord to bring me out.

471
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Is it not letting you back in?

472
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Are you being funny?

473
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
No.

474
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
No.

475
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Are you kidding me?

476
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
I don't hear you screaming.

477
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Your make cuts out.

478
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Azura.

479
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
So it just goes

480
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
What's happening?

481
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
What's happening?

482
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
It's constantly loading.

483
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Did you?

484
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
No.

485
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Can we do another?

486
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
I'm sorry.

487
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Will you guys see the discord if I open it?

488
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
No.

489
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,760
I'm sorry.

490
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
I should see anything else.

491
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
I would close the winner capture

492
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
in the OBS just in case.

493
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Yes, you can open it.

494
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Are we restarting a new lobby?

495
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
A new lobby?

496
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,760
I think we can still invite to this lobby.

497
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
A bit of all.

498
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Why is there two?

499
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Are we going to a different room?

500
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,760
I don't know.

501
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
I only see one of you.

502
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
No.

503
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Wait, there's a new one?

504
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
No, there's Azura again.

505
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
We're good.

506
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
We're Gucci.

507
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Okay, which one should we play?

508
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Normal.

509
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Knock off.

510
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Keep yourself focused.

511
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Try to replicate the drawings while the clock gets faster.

512
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Create animations in a collaborative way.

513
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Icebreaker.

514
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Play with a sentence.

515
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Exquisite co-ops.

516
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
This character is connected by the top of the drawings.

517
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I don't know what that means.

518
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Hold on.

519
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Complement.

520
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Complete the sketch.

521
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Start with basic lines and see other players' interpretations.

522
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Masterpiece.

523
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Create a piece of art.

524
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Play in a single term with no time limit.

525
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
I feel like story would be funny.

526
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Write a narrative using only the previous sentence.

527
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Yes, okay.

528
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
You want to do story?

529
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Yeah, let's try story.

530
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Start writing.

531
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Start.

532
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Oh.

533
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Wait, do I have to write a full story or just a sentence?

534
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Just a sentence.

535
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Okay, okay.

536
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Do you like write the whole story or no?

537
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
No, you have really limited characters.

538
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
I don't know it.

539
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
No.

540
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
What did you do?

541
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
There's time.

542
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
There's time.

543
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
15 seconds, love.

544
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Oh, my God.

545
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I wanted to write more.

546
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
You can only write one sentence.

547
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Okay.

548
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Done.

549
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
The end.

550
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
There's it.

551
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Oh.

552
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Oh.

553
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
We are not beating the caca allegations.

554
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Oh, my God.

555
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
What the fuck is happening?

556
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Oh, they're going to know this is me spelling it

557
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
because I didn't use a Z on that.

558
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
I'm just going to leave it like that.

559
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Yep, I'm sending it.

560
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I'm not even spell checking.

561
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Fuck it.

562
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Fuck it.

563
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
Fuck it.

564
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I'm bad at stories.

565
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
What the fuck?

566
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
So they...

567
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Oh.

568
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Oh, the sentence is so small.

569
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Like, I want to give a bit more.

570
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Me, too.

571
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Wait.

572
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,760
I think it gets shorter over time.

573
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
I'm going to be like,

574
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
I'm going to be like,

575
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
I'm going to write until, fuck.

576
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
What?

577
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
What's that?

578
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Okay.

579
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Wow.

580
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Let's see.

581
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Oh, no.

582
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Fuck.

583
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
I'm not a spell neighboring.

584
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Oh, fuck.

585
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Her name.

586
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
It's funny because...

587
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Yes.

588
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Nobody's the snippet.

589
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
The pen pals.

590
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
The bleeding hearts and the harem

591
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
all get to see this unfold.

592
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
And we're all just vaping like...

593
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
Oh.

594
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Fuck it.

595
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Oh, you...

596
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Wait, is that the fucking...

597
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Soft and warm.

598
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Fancy little bowl of fur.

599
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Happy kitty.

600
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Sleepy kitty.

601
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
You watch fucking

602
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
big bang

603
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
steering.

604
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Wait, that's a nice spell.

605
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I need more letters.

606
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
I am...

607
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Amazing.

608
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Amazing.

609
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
I'm an amazing writer.

610
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
That sounds like she me.

611
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
No.

612
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
I don't know this lyrics.

613
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
This...

614
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
This agency...

615
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
We can just...

616
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
This agency...

617
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
I hate this.

618
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
They don't give you enough to write.

619
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
It's like...

620
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Fuck off.

621
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Okay.

622
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Here's how terrible this is going to be.

623
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
I'll do the auto.

624
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
This is terrible.

625
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
How about everybody reads their own story?

626
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Yeah, of course.

627
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Okay.

628
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
In a galaxy far, far away

629
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
there was a goat with big titties.

630
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
She had so much milkers

631
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
and started raining milk.

632
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Milk.

633
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Azara then went on to make

634
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
an empire be milk daily.

635
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
It was so successful

636
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
the neighboring kingdoms became jealous.

637
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
They also wanted some of the juice.

638
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Ew, cooties are not good.

639
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
You're not good.

640
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Oh, boy.

641
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
Okay, long time ago

642
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
there was a polar bear princess

643
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
who was trying to fit into...

644
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
They're a little bit stronger

645
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
than any foreign addiction.

646
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
They couldn't touch it.

647
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,760
No, that was from Drake.

648
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
I didn't know how to finish it.

649
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
I was like...

650
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Ding ding.

651
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
That was supposed to be the song like ding ding.

652
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Ding ding.

653
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Ding ding.

654
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,760
I was so hard.

655
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm crying.

656
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
I'm crying.

657
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
I'm crying.

658
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
I'm crying.

659
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
There was a beach of agency

660
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
that was lived.

661
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
They all came in

662
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
and the children were just that bad.

663
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
So they danced, the pee-pee dance

664
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
and told the kids.

665
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
And then finally,

666
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
they peed everywhere on the

667
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
floor, the walls, the bed,

668
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
the kite.

669
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
We're all filled with piss everywhere

670
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
but he loved it.

671
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
The fact that he was in a piss prompt

672
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
before AC came out with that

673
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
literally wasn't used.

674
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,760
AC didn't have one.

675
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
AC didn't have one.

676
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Third.

677
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Seventh character added.

678
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
This is so good.

679
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Okay.

680
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Once upon a time, there were whores.

681
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
They were the elitists of whores.

682
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Wild West.

683
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,760
All these really cute cowgirls.

684
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Pussycat.

685
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
So cute.

686
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
So messy.

687
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Big bang theory. More like bang bang.

688
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Your mom left.

689
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Keep my mom out of your head now.

690
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
I'm sorry.

691
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Ten.

692
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Ten.

693
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Once upon a time, there was a big bump.

694
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Oh, no.

695
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Oh, no.

696
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Oh, no.

697
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Oh, no.

698
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Oh, no.

699
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Oh, no.

700
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Oh, no.

701
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Oh, no.

702
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Oh, no.

703
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Oh, no.

704
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Oh, no.

705
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Oh, no.

706
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
They all took mine.

707
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
She was trying to grab it.

708
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
She was trying to grab mine.

709
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Seriously.

710
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,760
My gosh.

711
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
She was trying to grab mine.

712
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
She was trying to grab mine.

713
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
She was trying to grab mine.

714
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
You can't stop thinking

715
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
What's the fun?

716
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
You guys know why I rate the scripts

717
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Why do we keep talking about shit all of that?

718
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,760
She became so bad, I hate this.

719
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Fuck no.

720
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,760
No, I didn't want to be pregnant by Sonic.

721
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Azura, do you have a mic filter on?

722
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
I can never hear you.

723
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Turn that mic.

724
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Get that steel-

725
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,760
See that steel-series.

726
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
No, it's not.

727
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Don't have a filter on.

728
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
There's no filter on?

729
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,760
No, there's no filter on.

730
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Your steel-series filter.

731
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
I don't have a filter.

732
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
I don't have one on.

733
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,760
What is happening?

734
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Can't wait for the void if we survive.

735
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
That'll be fine.

736
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Why don't we try another one?

737
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Another, another, another.

738
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Please, please, no more shit.

739
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
No more shit in his.

740
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,760
No promises.

741
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,760
I'll try my best.

742
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Can we do a compliment?

743
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,760
My stomach hurts.

744
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
All the actions are a mystery.

745
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
You can't hear Mercy, Mercy test?

746
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
Sorry, sorry.

747
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I was muting because I was coughing

748
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
because I was laughing.

749
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
My side hurts so badly.

750
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Okay, Mercy test complete.

751
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Do you want to do a compliment?

752
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,760
We draw on each other's drawings, basically.

753
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Oh, we should try that.

754
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,760
I think that would be fun.

755
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,760
I can't wait to draw some of this.

756
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Some basic lines, okay.

757
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,760
So sketch some basic lines, okay.

758
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Let me do this.

759
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Maybe I could just, maybe I would do like some basic lines.

760
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Like woo.

761
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Okay, boom.

762
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Boom.

763
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,760
Yeah.

764
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,760
I'm just gonna draw a bunch of dicks.

765
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
I just leave that.

766
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,760
To castle.

767
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,760
No.

768
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Are you joking?

769
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,760
These are blockers.

770
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
You know exactly what you did.

771
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
And no, I don't have the strength to resist.

772
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
What?

773
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Wait, wait, wait.

774
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
I got it, I can make this.

775
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,760
I can salvage this.

776
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
This is the back legs of it.

777
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
Uh-huh.

778
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,760

There you go.

781
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Only a few more lines.

782
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Uh-huh.

783
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
Yeah, you're so dark.

784
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
You're so creepy.

785
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Honestly.

786
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
I'll get the girl to tell you off if you don't behave.

787
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
That's shocking.

788
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
You guys don't have innocent eyes anymore.

789
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Why?

790
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Cute.

791
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
It's all rude to me.

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Cute little girl.

793
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Wait, am I supposed to finish this off?

794
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Are we supposed to finish it off?

795
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
I think so, because it's given us tons of time.

796
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Hold on.

797
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Oh, okay.

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
wait no that's not nice

955
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
this is all a C right now

956
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
and I'm not even going to pretend otherwise

957
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,880
it was definitely Azura that drew the ball sack

958
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
100%

959
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
why do I feel like this is a lie

960
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
no I didn't draw it

961
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
I'm really drawing over it right now

962
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
if you guys didn't know

963
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
Azura's ears actually have

964
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,880
gold jewelry on the end of them

965
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,880
this is nice

966
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
she's pimped out with jewelry

967
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
but it's like not a vanity

968
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,880
there you go

969
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880
it's like gifts

970
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,880
isn't cheating to erase

971
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,880
isn't it cute

972
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
so if you didn't know when a women

973
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
when a women lactate

974
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
well how

975
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
oh my god

976
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
through the fabric

977
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
so they'll be like a piece of gold

978
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
I know this isn't Azura's

979
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
that's cool

980
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
that looks terrible get rid of that

981
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
oh my god you can't just control Z it

982
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
my life

983
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
I was trying to talk about lactation though

984
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880

985
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880

986
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,880

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880

990
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880

991
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,880
I have saved

992
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
I have single-handedly saved

993
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
the stream probably

994
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
this is supposed to be the liquid

995
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
the liquid

996
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
wait this is fine

997
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
that's cheating I know what I wanted to draw

998
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
that's nothing

999
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,880
fine I didn't know what to draw for my own drawing

1000
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
fine

1001
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,880
I started it

1002
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,880

1003
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880

I would talk about it

1011
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,880
it takes too much brain power

1012
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
to do this and poop

1013
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880

00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,880
to the designs that you assigned them

1327
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,880

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,880
oh someone rated the vtuber

1338
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,880
they were like the only thing that would have been

1339
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
it better as if

1340
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
you let them design their models

1341
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
from the start I'm like bruv

1342
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,880
it took me a fucking year to get here

1343
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
oh my god

1344
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,880
it takes forever to

1345
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,880
it is not like an overnight thing

1346
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,880
draw and rank a vtuber model

1347
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,880
honestly who am I missing

1348
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,880
she knows how to do it

1349
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,880
the lot of work

1350
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,880
oh my god

1351
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,880
there's only a select few corpos that will let you do that

1352
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,880
literally it takes a little long

1353
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
oh shit

1354
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,880
man this is rough

1355
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,880
usually ones that have like artists in house as well

1356
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
yeah we don't

1357
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,880
we just put in the coin part

1358
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,880
most companies

1359
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,880
if not all of them

1360
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,880
say for you

1361
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,880
will have

1362
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,880
pre-made

1363
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,880
pre-made

1364
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,880
so it's not actually standard

1365
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,880
for people to choose

1366
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
it's really not

1367
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
that's why it's usually like

1368
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
cast for the roles

1369
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,880
you have to fit the characters

1370
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
everything for

1371
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
no

1372
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,880
there

1373
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
what the fuck

1374
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880
is that

1375
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
it looks like an abomination

1376
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,880
oh

1377
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,880
memorize it and replicate it

1378
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,880
this is easy

1379
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
what is this

1380
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
look how cute this is

1381
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,880
okay

1382
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
now we have to draw it

1383
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
are we ready

1384
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,880
just draw it your way

1385
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
and that's the fun part

1386
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,880
I've already forgot which position everyone was in

1387
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880
wrong

1388
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,880
this is so bad

1389
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
sorry reflinx honestly I would talk more

1390
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,880
but this takes so much brain power

1391
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
to do this

1392
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,880
I'm so brain dead

1393
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,880
like I'm

1394
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,880
I'm reading chat

1395
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
I'm reading everything but I'm not

1396
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
responding I'm so sorry

1397
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,880
I can see everyone

1398
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,880
saying

1399
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,880
I'm just really in this

1400
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,880
I can't remember

1401
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,880
who was where

1402
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
I'm just fucking losing it

1403
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,880
I think

1404
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
oh boy

1405
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,880
I forgot there was a shorter time

1406
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,880
what the fuck

1407
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,880
that's far too short

1408
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,880
this is why it's chaotic

1409
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,880
why was the other one longer

1410
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,880
I don't remember what

1411
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
I didn't want to do that

1412
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,880
oh

1413
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,880
okay okay okay

1414
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
okay

1415
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,880
oh shit there's like no time

1416
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
we draw this as fast

1417
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,880
as we can

1418
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
oh fuck

1419
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,880

1420
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
no no no

1421
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,880
not like this

1422
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880
I can't remember what it looked like

1423
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
is there supposed to be someone

1424
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,880
in a pirate boat by the way

1425
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,880
cause I don't think I saw it

1426
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
is there supposed to be a person in it

1427
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,880
I don't know

1428
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,880
the timer is supposed

1429
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
to go really fast

1430
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,880
so it's

1431
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
oh my god

1432
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,880
okay that's easy enough

1433
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,880
that's easy enough

1434
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,880
oh it's already half

1435
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,880

1444
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,880

don't panic don't panic

1454
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,880
the greatest part is that

1455
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,880
we are all panicking

1456
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,880

1464
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,880

1465
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,880

01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
I mean

1472
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,880
that was rough

1473
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
oh my god

1474
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,880
that was rough

1475
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,880
that was rough

1476
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,880
that was easy really

1477
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,880
oh my god

1478
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
that's amazing

1479
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
I love it

1480
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,880
oh

1481
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,880
oh

1482
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,880
oh

1483
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
you have all the time

1484
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
why didn't you give me time

1485
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,880
I did not have

1486
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,880
any time for this

1487
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,880
I was like

1488
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,880
at least

1489
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
at least it stayed a cat

1490
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
at least it stayed a cat

1491
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,880
that little campfire with all of us together

1492
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,880
that's so fucking cute

1493
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,880
that's what I hate most

1494
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,880
we don't have time

1495
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
we don't have time

1496
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
we're doing a slack of face

1497
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,880
we're doing a slack of face

1498
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,880
oh we're all here in room 5

1499
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:18,960
Okay, this is good this stage

1500
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:52,080
oh she's not in jail she's at the

1501
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,320
king

1502
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,320
Okay, that looks like it.

1503
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,320
Oh my God.

1504
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,320
Oh, no.

1505
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,320
Oh, no.

1506
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,320
Oh, no.

1507
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,320
Oh, my God.

1508
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,320
Oh, my God.

1509
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,320
Oh, my God.

1510
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,320
Oh, my God.

1511
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,320
Oh, my God.

1512
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,320
Oh, my God.

1513
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,320
She broke her tail by the end.

1514
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,320
She broke it.

1515
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,320
He's freeing it.

1516
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,320
Wow.

1517
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,320
Oh, so close.

1518
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,320
One piece.

1519
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,320
I was like, why the...

1520
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,320
I was like, what was the thing in the bowl?

1521
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,320
I was like...

1522
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,320
I was like, stop.

1523
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,320
Oh, no.

1524
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Oh, my God.

1525
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,320
She's getting ugly.

1526
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,320
She's getting all the water.

1527
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,320
Oh, my God.

1528
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,320
Oh, my God.

1529
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,320
Oh, my God.

1530
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,320
Oh, my God.

1531
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,320
Oh, my God.

1532
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,320
Oh, my God.

1533
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,320
Oh, my God.

1534
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,320
Oh, my God.

1535
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,320
Oh, my God.

1536
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,320
Oh, my God.

1537
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,320
It looks like a floating fish.

1538
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,320
Oh.

1539
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,320
Oh, my God.

1540
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,320
She's shooting her piss.

1541
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,320
She's shooting her piss?

1542
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,320
Wait, that's supposed to be me.

1543
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,320
What?

1544
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,320
You're giving her rest.

1545
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,320
Oh, my goodness.

1546
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,320
It needs to survive.

1547
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,320
Before we bite him.

1548
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Oh.

1549
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,320
The piss is gone.

1550
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,320
Oh, my God.

1551
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,320
Oh, my God.

1552
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,320
Oh, my God.

1553
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,320
Oh, that was so good.

1554
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,320
That was so good, right?

1555
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,320
One more.

1556
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,320
One more.

1557
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,320
One more.

1558
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,320
One more.

1559
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,320
One more.

1560
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,320
One more.

1561
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,320
One more.

1562
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,320
What have we not done?

1563
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,320
I don't know.

1564
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,320
I don't remember.

1565
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,320
All the actions are mystery.

1566
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,320
Drawing and sentences are hitting during the game.

1567
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,320
What's the secret?

1568
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,320
The secret seems rough.

1569
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,320
I've never done that one before.

1570
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,320
Okay.

1571
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,320
We'll try it.

1572
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,320
Last round, boys.

1573
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,320
Last round.

1574
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,320
Okay, okay, okay.

1575
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,320
Oh, shoot.

1576
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,320
What?

1577
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,320
Oh, it's a secret.

1578
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,320
How else does it know what I'm writing?

1579
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,320
Wait, what?

1580
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,320
Huh?

1581
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,320
Yeah!

1582
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,320
It's a secret to everyone.

1583
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,320
Oh, bro.

1584
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,320
I can't erase my things.

1585
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,320
I don't know.

1586
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,320
What is this?

1587
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,320
Um...

1588
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,320
Why is this?

1589
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,320
Oh!

1590
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,320
The lines disappear too!

1591
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,320
It just appears.

1592
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,320
Oh, we can't see what we're drawing?

1593
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,320
What?

1594
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,320
Okay, I'll draw fast.

1595
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,320
What the fuck?

1596
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,320
Okay.

1597
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,320
I don't know. I think...

1598
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,320
I'm going to just guess...

1599
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,320
what it is.

1600
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,320
Where it is?

1601
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,320
That's so funny.

1602
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,320
Oh, god.

1603
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,320
What the fuck?

1604
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,320
Oh, no, no.

1605
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,320
I'm going to try to draw.

1606
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,320
Why is it so hard?

1607
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,320
Do-do-do.

1608
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,320
Do-do-do-do.

1609
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,320
Do-do-do-do-do.

1610
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,320
Um...

1611
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,320
These are the past ones.

1612
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,320
Can I...

1613
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,320
Can I go backwards?

1614
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,320
Does it work like that?

1615
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,320
I didn't give you his legs.

1616
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,320
Oh, sugar.

1617
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,320
Yeah!

1618
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,320
Um...

1619
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,320
I hope Ace is somewhere there.

1620
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,320
This is gonna...

1621
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,320
I don't even know what I drew.

1622
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,320
No idea.

1623
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,320
I can't tell what those are.

1624
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,320
What is that?

1625
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,320
Okay.

1626
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,320
Okay.

1627
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,320
Okay.

1628
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,320
I spelled that all wrong.

1629
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,320
No, I didn't get it.

1630
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,320
What the fuck?

1631
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,320
Uh...

1632
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,320
What?

1633
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,320
What does that even mean?

1634
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,320
Um, shit.

1635
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,320
That is not even me.

1636
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,320
I'm sorry.

1637
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,320
Okay.

1638
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,320
Okay.

1639
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,320
Fuck.

1640
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,320
I don't know what else to draw.

1641
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,320
That's exactly what I drew, I think.

1642
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,320
Is this a vine reference?

1643
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,320
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1644
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,320
Locked in.

1645
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,320
I locked in.

1646
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,320
Did I give...

1647
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,320
Wait, did I give them bodies?

1648
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,320
I don't think I gave them bodies.

1649
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,320
I don't even know where they are.

1650
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,320
I don't know.

1651
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,320
There's a shot in the dark.

1652
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,320
Mercy, you know what that is gonna be interpreted as.

1653
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,320
And will I stop the creative flow?

1654
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,320
Oh my god.

1655
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,320
Do you stop the creative flow?

1656
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,320
Oh my god.

1657
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,320
Amy's got a hoodie here.

1658
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,320
Oh, sugar.

1659
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,320
I put juice on her.

1660
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,320
This is hard.

1661
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,320
I didn't even know what the fuck I'm doing anymore.

1662
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,320
I'm fucking dying.

1663
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,320
What is this?

1664
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,320
What is this?

1665
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,320
What is this?

1666
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,320
What is happening?

1667
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,320
Someone had a stroke.

1668
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,320
Could you ever do this one?

1669
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,320
Hope you're feeling okay.

1670
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,320
Make sure you hydrate.

1671
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,320
Fuck, I didn't have enough time to write it.

1672
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,320
Oh man.

1673
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,320
How do I even draw this?

1674
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,320
This is...

1675
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,320
Mm-hmm.

1676
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,320
Mm-hmm.

1677
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,320
That's the tongue.

1678
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,320
And then this is...

1679
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,320
literally everyone.

1680
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,320
Wait.

1681
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,320
I don't know.

1682
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,320
Okay, then what...

1683
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,320
I don't know where the body is.

1684
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,320
What am I drawing?

1685
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,320
Oh.

1686
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,320
I...

1687
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,320
Motion swipes as well.

1688
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,320
And a little arrow to indicate which...

1689
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,320
Yeah.

1690
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,320
Yeah, there we go.

1691
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,320
I think I drew it correctly.

1692
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,320
A little bit of lipstick.

1693
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,320
Ah, where is it?

1694
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,320
Cute? I don't know.

1695
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,320
I just drew anything.

1696
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,320
I don't know.

1697
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,320
Oh, she's sad.

1698
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,320
No, my hair.

1699
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,320
I can't wait to see the end of this.

1700
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,320
This is going to be...

1701
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,320
This is a great...

1702
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,320
This is going to be fucking insane.

1703
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,320
What's going on in the ceiling?

1704
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,320
Oh, I need to draw on the ceiling quick.

1705
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,320
There we go.

1706
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,320
Oh, I'm so scared of what these look like.

1707
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,320
Me too.

1708
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,320
Me too.

1709
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,320
I can't read.

1710
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,320
It's the end of the TikTok.

1711
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,320
Oh, my God.

1712
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,320
Oh, my God.

1713
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,320
I think she's beautiful.

1714
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,320
I was like...

1715
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,320
Oh, you're not okay.

1716
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,320
I completely missed the body.

1717
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,320
Oh, my God.

1718
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,320
Don't talk to my face.

1719
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,320
Don't talk to my face.

1720
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,320
Don't talk to my face.

1721
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,320
I was going to...

1722
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,320
I was going to write even being cute.

1723
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,320
She was on a stick.

1724
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,320
I'm so dating.

1725
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,320
I'm so sad.

1726
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,320
I'm so sorry.

1727
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,320
Oh, that's why you were home in Indiana Jones.

1728
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,320
I was like, where did that come from?

1729
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,320
I was trying to write Cowboy,

1730
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,320
but I didn't.

1731
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,320
Oh, that's so adorable.

1732
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,320
I got so mad.

1733
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,320
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1734
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,320
You're talking to me.

1735
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,320
I'm sorry.

1736
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,320
Wait, why is he crying?

1737
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,320
Your eye is gone.

1738
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,320
It's gone white.

1739
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,320
It's gone purple.

1740
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,320
I love colors.

1741
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,320
It really was cooked.

1742
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,320
I love colors.

1743
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,320
I used the color black

1744
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,320
and I used red as well

1745
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,320
and orange.

1746
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,320
What is going on with him?

1747
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,320
That's so rude.

1748
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,320
He's loving.

1749
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,320
He's loving.

1750
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,320
He's so dead.

1751
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,320
I can't breathe.

1752
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,320
This was beautiful.

1753
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,320
Hey.

1754
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,320
I like this girl.

1755
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,320
Oh.

1756
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,320
He's like,

1757
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,320
what is going on?

1758
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,320
I don't know.

1759
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,320
I don't know.

1760
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,320
You're so fucking eraser.

1761
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,320
That's why you're so cute.

1762
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,320
You're so cute.

1763
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,320
You're so cute.

1764
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,320
How did we get back to boobs?

1765
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,320
I don't know how you ran into that.

1766
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,320
Obviously.

1767
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,320
Well, actually, that potato was really bad.

1768
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,320
Never mind.

1769
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,320
Aw.

1770
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,320
Awesome.

1771
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,320
You'll learn number one.

1772
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,320
Wait, I don't know.

1773
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,320
You'll learn number three.

1774
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,320
You're so cute.

1775
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,320
You're so cute.

1776
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,320
I'm so sorry.

1777
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,320
I'm so sorry.

1778
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,320
I'm so sorry.

1779
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,320
I'm sorry.

1780
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,320
I'm so sorry.

1781
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,320
Stop.

1782
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,320
Oh no.

1783
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,320
Look at his soul.

1784
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,320
What's happening in the middle of the world?

1785
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,320
Oh my god.

1786
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,320
Oh my god.

1787
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,320
The book got you this.

1788
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,320
Oh, they drew us?

1789
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,320
Yes.

1790
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,320
Your mom called me.

1791
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,320
No!

1792
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,320
No!

1793
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,320
No!

1794
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,320
No!

1795
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,320
No!

1796
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,320
Oh no!

1797
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,320
What are you doing?

1798
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,320
Oh no!

1799
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,320
Oh my god!

1800
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,320
What keeps her from smiling?

1801
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,320
Same.

1802
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,320
My jaw hurt.

1803
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,320
Okay, okay.

1804
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,320
Oh no!

1805
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,320
Okay!

1806
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,320
Oh my god!

1807
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,320
Oh my god!

1808
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,320
Oh my god!

1809
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,320
Oh my god!

1810
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,320
Can somebody download that one?

1811
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,320
Oh my god!

1812
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,320
Oh my god!

1813
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,320
That's so amazing!

1814
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,320
That's so fucking funny!

1815
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,320
I love it!

1816
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,320
That's so fucking funny!

1817
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,320
That's so fucking funny!

1818
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,320
That's so fucking funny!

1819
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,320
I love it!

1820
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,320
They got the premium pass!

1821
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,320
They got the premium pass!

1822
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,320
You see at the convention.

1823
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,320
They got the premium pass.

1824
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,320
That's funny!

1825
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,320
I'm tying Amy to the tracks.

1826
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,320
Oh my god!

1827
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,320
Holy shit!

1828
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,320
I'm not going to endure the girls to anything more.

1829
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,320
Because our faces are ready to fall off after that.

1830
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,320
Is anyone doing a stream?

1831
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,320
Is anyone doing a stream?

1832
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,320
Is anyone putting?

1833
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,320
Are you doing a stream right away, Isnora?

1834
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,320
Because I'll do something.

1835
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,320
I need to appear really bad.

1836
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,320
I'm going to jump out of the call.

1837
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,320
Of course, you need to pee.

1838
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,320
I'm going to jump out of the call.

1839
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,320
I'm asking my new piss out!

1840
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,320
I know!

1841
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,320
I'm going to jump out of the call

1842
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,320
and do a little zart so then I'll redirect into you, Isnora.

1843
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,320
I'm going to jump out of the call and do a little zart so then I'll redirect into you, Isnora.

1844
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,320
Okay?

1845
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,320
I'm going to be on start though.

1846
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,320
Okay, right.

1847
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,320
I might play, do you guys want me to?

1848
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,320
I might play some Call of the Lamb.

1849
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,320
If someone does a pop-up stream just tell me.

1850
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,320
I'll talk to my refunds for a bit.

1851
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,320
Thank you so so much all members and dolls

1852
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,320
for this hilarity that ensued

1853
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,320
after such a miserable start.

1854
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,320
That's amazing.

1855
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,320
Such a miserable start to power water.

1856
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,320
I always shat myself from laughing so hard.

1857
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,320
Oh my god.

1858
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,320
We already know AC's panties are soaked.

1859
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,320
So let's not...

1860
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,320
Am I probably?

1861
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,320
No!

1862
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,320
No.

1863
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,320
Alright, let me sniff.

1864
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,320
Let me sniff test.

1865
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,320
No! Don't do the sniff test!

1866
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,320
Rather pungent my dear.

1867
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,320
You have to take a test.

1868
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,320
Taste instead.

1869
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,320
She just disintegrated.

1870
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,320
Oh my god.

1871
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,320
Great.

1872
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,320
I'm going to jump out of chat.

1873
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,320
Thank you so much.

1874
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,320
I'll see you guys next week with each other.

1875
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,320
So look out for that.

1876
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,320
I'll jump out of chat.

1877
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,320
Thank you so much my darlings, my daughters, my girls.

1878
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,320
I'll talk to you very shortly.

1879
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,320
I'm off to the refunds.

1880
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,320
I love you my daughters.

1881
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,320
These are the Villalor girls.

1882
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,320
Yeah.

1883
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,320
They're so cute, right?

1884
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,320
Oh my god.

1885
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,320
That was really something.

1886
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,320
Okay, wait.

1887
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,320
Are you guys still streaming?

1888
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,320
Yeah.

1889
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,320
I am.

1890
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,320
I don't know what to do.

1891
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,320
I guess I got to go off.

1892
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,320
Okay, let's go off.

1893
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,320
Go to just chatting and then raid into Azra.

1894
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,320
I think Azra's next, right?

1895
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,320
Yeah.

1896
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,320
Me and Azra are going to be streaming.

1897
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,320
She's doing Stardew.

1898
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,320
I'm doing Call of the Limb.

1899
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,320
Wait, wait.

1900
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,320
So Shibi and Azra are going to stream right now?

1901
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,320
Yeah, I'm going to keep streaming.

1902
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,320
No.

1903
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,320
I'm probably going to end this one

1904
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,320
so that the bot is separated.

1905
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,320
Oh, yeah.

1906
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,320
I ended it to make a new one.

1907
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,320
Okay.

1908
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,320
I'll hang up and then I'll go to the

1909
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,320
just chatting and then I'll send.

1910
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,320
I'll check if y'all ready.

1911
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,320
Okay.

1912
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,320
Bye-bye.

1913
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,320
Okay.

1914
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,320
Bye-bye.

1915
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,320
Okay.

1916
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,320
I don't know why my chat isn't working.

1917
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,320
I've double triple-checked it.

1918
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,320
I'm so sorry.

1919
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,320
My darling.

1920
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,320
Snippets.

1921
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,320
My senpai.

1922
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,320
That we were going to play,

1923
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,320
as you know, we were going to play

1924
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,320
Power Wash Simulator

1925
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,320
except

1926
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,320
isn't, because you had to redo the room.

1927
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,320
You're probably right.

1928
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,320
You're probably right.

1929
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,320
Yeah, you're probably right.

1930
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,320
And what happened with

1931
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,320
Power Wash Simulator

1932
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,320
is that every time

1933
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,320
it got past four people

1934
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,320
it just disconnected

1935
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,320
and would not connect

1936
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,320
everyone in, even though we were in a room

1937
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,320
for six players.

1938
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,320
And then that was

1939
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,320
and then we couldn't

1940
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,320
we tried. We tried over and over

1941
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,320
and over and over again and we're like

1942
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,320
stop, stop moving, stop moving.

1943
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,320
Maybe they'll come in if we stop moving

1944
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,320
and it didn't work. And so instead

1945
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,320
we

1946
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,320
we ended up having

1947
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,320
to pick something

1948
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,320
really fast. So we went through

1949
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,320
a list of games. We're like

1950
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,320
do you have this? No. Do you have this? No.

1951
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,320
Do you have this? No. Oh shit.

1952
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,320
How about we do Jackbox? Oh shit. How do you stream

1953
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,320
Jackbox? We don't know how to stream Jackbox.

1954
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,320
All of us can't stream

1955
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,320
Jackbox. What do we have instead? Oh,

1956
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,320
we have Gartik Phone. That's free.

1957
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,320
And so we stayed

1958
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,320
with Gartik Phone instead.

1959
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,320
So I apologize

1960
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,320
for the fact that we did not do

1961
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,320
PowerWash Simulator

1962
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,320
because it was like

1963
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,320
if I knew everyone was going to go

1964
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,320
like balls to the walls

1965
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,320
like

1966
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,320
yeah, I wouldn't have

1967
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,320
tried to save the stream.

1968
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,320
I didn't have to try to save it

1969
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,320
but I ended up

1970
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,320
as far as a train

1971
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,320
wreck. It's far from the moon.

1972
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,320
This ball is going to go away.

1973
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,320
Probably.

1974
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,320
I'll see if it stays up but it might go away.

1975
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,320
I never stood a chance.

1976
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,320
I never stood a chance. I was like

1977
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,320
oh man.

1978
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,320
It's okay. Can you

1979
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,320
see how

1980
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,320
how like

1981
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,320
gosh, we're so friendly with each

1982
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,320
other. It's so funny.

1983
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,320
It's so funny.

1984
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,320
I'm sorry. Also earlier

1985
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,320
when you heard like the weird sounds, I'm so

1986
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,320
sorry. I literally laughed so hard.

1987
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,320
I

1988
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,320
the my T went out my nose.

1989
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,320
Everyone's so cute together. I know

1990
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,320
they're so cute, right?

1991
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,320
I love them so much.

1992
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,320
I love them so much.

1993
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,320
Honestly, we

1994
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,320
we're very

1995
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,320
we're very

1996
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,320
off the walls with each other.

1997
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,320
We're off the walls to each other.

1998
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,320
My stomach hurts

1999
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,320
so badly.

2000
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,320
The side of my ears

2001
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,320
are hurting from my headphones

2002
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,320
from laughing so hard.

2003
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,320
Very wholesome.

2004
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,320
I missed the

2005
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,320
tear of the day. I think it's green tea.

2006
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,320
I think it's just a regular green tea.

2007
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,320
It really

2008
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,320
unfortunately

2009
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:47,320
my arm

2010
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,320
is still really, really, really bad.

2011
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,320
It's less bad than before, but now

2012
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,320
it's all like bumpy and gross.

2013
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,320
So

2014
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,320
I'm gonna go rest again in order

2015
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,320
for it to calm down. I sent

2016
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,320
pictures to the girls and they were like,

2017
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,320
oh geez, are you gonna be okay for

2018
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,320
today's stream? And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it'll be fine.

2019
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,320
Someone said you were snorting matcha. I mean, like

2020
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,320
it's probably green tea. So yeah,

2021
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,320
what is green tea? It's matcha.

2022
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,320
Was an allergic reaction? I think it's an

2023
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,320
allergic reaction.

2024
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,320
I think it's an allergic

2025
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,320
reaction.

2026
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,320
But it's like, I felt it last night.

2027
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,320
It crawled.

2028
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,320
Like the rash went all the way to my back

2029
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,320
and I was like,

2030
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,320
what's going on?

2031
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,320
So I changed shirts and everything. I changed

2032
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,320
shirts.

2033
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,320
I changed shirts.

2034
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,320
I'm gonna see if by

2035
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,320
Saturday,

2036
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,320
if by Saturday, if it doesn't go away,

2037
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,320
I'm gonna go to the doctor because

2038
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,320
it is like

2039
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,320
more than half

2040
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,320
down now. It's like,

2041
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,320
it's no long, it's still red

2042
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,320
ish. It's pink. It's more pink than red

2043
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,320
and less bumpy.

2044
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,320
So it should

2045
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,320
be fine.

2046
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,320
It should be fine. I'm looking at my arm right now.

2047
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,320
You should invest in EpiPen for sure though.

2048
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,320
I was gonna drink

2049
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,320
some Benadryl, but Benadryl makes me really

2050
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,320
sleepy and I didn't want to take it before

2051
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,320
the stream.

2052
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,320
It's improving.

2053
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,320
I put some Vaseline on it

2054
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,320
to soothe it, to soothe it.

2055
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,320
Have you tried taking

2056
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,320
Benadryl while showering?

2057
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,320
Is that supposed to be like some kind of

2058
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,320
innuendo thing?

2059
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,320
Are you gonna take it now? Yeah, after stream,

2060
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,320
right now.

2061
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,320
I know that Benadryl

2062
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,320
is supposed to be

2063
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,320
what do you call it?

2064
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,320
It's supposed to make people sleepy and in Japan

2065
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,320
it's marketed as a sleeping

2066
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,320
aid, but

2067
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,320
a lot of my friends

2068
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,320
don't feel the sleepy effect from it.

2069
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,320
They're like, oh.

2070
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:31,320
They're like, oh, it's

2071
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,320
it makes me actually quite awake

2072
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,320
and I was like, damn, now

2073
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,320
it makes me sleepy. So I'm gonna drink

2074
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,320
some, I'm gonna take some

2075
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,320
and then we're gonna see if this rash goes down

2076
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,320
so we can

2077
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,320
maybe have a good time.

2078
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,320
Tomorrow, I believe, is Harvester.

2079
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,320
Let's go over my schedule again.

2080
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,320
Where's my schedule?

2081
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,320
There it is.

2082
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,320
Tomorrow is

2083
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,320
Harvester

2084
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,320
part two.

2085
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,320
So we'll have a lot of

2086
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,320
fun with that.

2087
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,320
Um

2088
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,320
and then

2089
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,320
after after that Saturday

2090
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,320
is my day off and then Sunday

2091
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,320
we're back at it with an unarchived

2092
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,320
karaoke stream.

2093
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,320
So we'll be singing

2094
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,320
some songs.

2095
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,320
We'll be

2096
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,320
humming some haas.

2097
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,320
Yeah, so

2098
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,320
that's it.

2099
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,320
Remember, this is

2100
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,320
since I woke up early for the club

2101
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,320
Harvester

2102
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,320
and the unarchived

2103
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,320
karaoke stream will be at

2104
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,320
my regular times at 11pm

2105
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,320
EDT.

2106
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,320
So we're gonna

2107
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,320
we're gonna have a good time.

2108
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,320
Hopefully I'm really looking forward

2109
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,320
to Harvester. Maybe we'll finish it. Who knows.

2110
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,320
If there's multiple endings

2111
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,320
I might try all of them.

2112
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,320
Who knows.

2113
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,320
Or I might keep one ending.

2114
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,320
That might be the case.

2115
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,320
But yeah, I'm looking forward to

2116
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,320
the rest of the week and then the following week

2117
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,320
when the following week will be

2118
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,320
much less streams

2119
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,320
and I probably need that dang rest.

2120
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,320
I need that dang rest.

2121
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,320
So thank you

2122
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,320
for the stream. I hope

2123
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,320
this was okay for some

2124
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,320
EU, EU bros.

2125
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,320
I'm sorry that a lot of people can't catch my streams.

2126
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,320
You know how far through

2127
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,320
you got last time? No idea.

2128
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,320
No idea. We're on our third

2129
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,320
third thingy.

2130
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,320
So I'm probably gonna take a rest next week

2131
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,320
and then recharge myself

2132
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,320
again and slowly

2133
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
put my streams back to

2134
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,320
five streams a week.

2135
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,320
So

2136
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,320
let's get my thingy

2137
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,320
out. My stream thingy

2138
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,320
out. Where's my room?

2139
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,320
Where's my room? Room?

2140
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,320
My live room!

2141
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,320
My live room and then

2142
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,320
we'll raid into

2143
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,320
one of the girls

2144
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,320
in one of the

2145
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,320
third.

2146
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,320
So let's see.

2147
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,320
I'll send you guys

2148
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,320
into Azura

2149
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,320
Azura Dulays

2150
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,320
stream

2151
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,320
because I think she's starting

2152
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,320
starting Stardew Valley.

2153
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:57,320
Yeah.

2154
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,320
Unless she sings for like

2155
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,320
hours again then yeah.

2156
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,320
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

2157
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,320
I'm gonna

2158
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,320
maybe put an ice pack on my

2159
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,320
hives rash again.

2160
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,320
So thank you so much everyone

2161
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
for today. I know it's chaotic

2162
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,320
and I'm very sorry

2163
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,320
that you waited a long time

2164
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,320
due to technical difficulties

2165
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,320
but I'm hoping to see you all

2166
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:23,320
tomorrow or another time very soon.

2167
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,320
Okay.

2168
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,320
And that's, let's go!

2169
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,320
Scream for Mercy!

2170
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,320
Thanks for watching!
