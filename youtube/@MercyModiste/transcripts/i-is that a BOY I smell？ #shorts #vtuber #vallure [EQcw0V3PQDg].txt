Is that a boy? I smell?
Mmm, yes, I smell it. Boy smell!
I smell a boy. What's a boy doing here?
Oh my gosh, what am I gonna do? There's a boy here! I'm freaking out so much!
Calm down, calm down, and take a nice deep breath.
It smells so good! I love boy smell so much!
It makes me feel amazing! I'm getting tingles all over from the delicious boy scent!
It's driving me boy crazy!
