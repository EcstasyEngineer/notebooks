00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
When do we get a cooking stream with Kohai?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,120
Um, to be honest, I'm a little clumsy.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,680
Last time I tried to go in the kitchen,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,880
mama said, get out.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,880
Yeah, I mean, I don't blame her.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,720
You want to hear a funny story?

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,320
So I was trying to cut strawberries with a fruit knife.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,240
And if you didn't know, fruit knives,

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,840
the sharp part is not the curved part.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,920
The sharp part is the flat side.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,560
You can see where I'm getting at, right?

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,160
So I was cutting strawberries,

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,400
and I was having trouble cutting the strawberries.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,520
And mama looked at me and said, it's upside down.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
And you know what I did?

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,720
I flipped the strawberry and not the knife.

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,280
And continued trying to,

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
to,

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,280
continued trying to cut it.

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,400
I got it in the end when she grabbed the knife

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,120
and put it down to the flat side instead.

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,400
How did you survive this long?

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
I have no idea, to be honest.
