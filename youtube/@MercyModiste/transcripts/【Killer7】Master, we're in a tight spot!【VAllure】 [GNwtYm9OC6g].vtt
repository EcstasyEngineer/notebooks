10:10.420 --> 10:17.420
I had my, I had my, I had my weekly breakdown just before stream!

10:40.920 --> 10:45.420
Ugh, I tried my best.

10:45.420 --> 10:51.420
I like, I like, did it, uh, I didn't cry.

10:51.420 --> 10:56.420
Or like, oh shit, I don't remember which slot I saved in.

10:56.420 --> 11:09.420
Uh, I like, uh, I didn't cry.

11:09.420 --> 11:14.420
And then the moment I hit live, I like, transition, I was like, ah, fuck.

11:14.420 --> 11:22.420
Just wait till I'm on my 19th, 19th nervous breakdown.

11:22.420 --> 11:29.420
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.420
Oh yeah.

11:30.420 --> 11:34.420
Or I gotta keep like, which one is the one that I saved in?

11:34.420 --> 11:39.420
Oh, no data, okay, okay, yeah, okay.

11:39.420 --> 11:42.420
I think I know which one, we're in, we're in this one.

11:42.420 --> 11:49.420
So, yeah, let's load this file.

11:49.420 --> 11:56.420
Look at those weekly hands!

11:56.420 --> 11:58.420
I took my Walsh's sickness meds, yeah.

11:58.420 --> 12:04.420
About half an hour before stream started.

12:04.420 --> 12:08.420
I'm looking at a moon.

12:08.420 --> 12:13.420
Ugh, okay.

12:13.420 --> 12:18.420
Do I remember how this works?

12:18.420 --> 12:23.420
Okay, that's movements.

12:23.420 --> 12:27.420
Yes, okay.

12:27.420 --> 12:30.420
Press A, hold A to continue.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.420
Yes, yes, yes, I forgot!

12:32.420 --> 12:34.420
Has your rash been feeling better?

12:34.420 --> 12:42.420
Yeah, except for my doctor was like, except for now I'm starting at my rashes.

12:42.420 --> 12:48.420
On my legs and my other arm.

12:48.420 --> 12:56.420
And now I have an appointment with a dermatologist.

12:56.420 --> 13:01.420
Yeah.

13:01.420 --> 13:03.420
Wait, which way was I supposed to go?

13:03.420 --> 13:08.420
I can't remember.

13:08.420 --> 13:14.420
Oh, shit.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.420
I can have your skin.

13:16.420 --> 13:24.420
Here, I'll peel it off gently with a carving knife.

13:24.420 --> 13:29.420
Oh, shit, was it this?

13:29.420 --> 13:31.420
No, it was the other way.

13:31.420 --> 13:38.420
It was the other way, tee-hee.

13:38.420 --> 13:40.420
Boiler room.

13:40.420 --> 13:44.420
Okay, let's see if I remember.

13:44.420 --> 13:47.420
You happen to have any items from this level so far?

13:47.420 --> 13:49.420
I don't remember.

13:49.420 --> 13:52.420
Let's check.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.420
Oh, items.

13:54.420 --> 13:57.420
I have the firing equipeted.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.420
I have some bloods.

14:00.420 --> 14:03.420
And here's all the smiths.

14:03.420 --> 14:08.420
I like using Dan the most because he's, he shoots fast.

14:08.420 --> 14:17.420
He shoots at fast.

14:17.420 --> 14:29.420
What the fuck is this?

14:29.420 --> 14:33.420
F.

14:33.420 --> 14:37.420
U.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.420
Okay.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.420
Input error.

14:40.420 --> 14:44.420
Wait, was there a hint somewhere?

14:44.420 --> 14:45.420
Was there a hint?

14:45.420 --> 14:54.420
Oh, shit, reload.

14:54.420 --> 14:56.420
Bit rude.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.420
Was there a hint somewhere?

14:58.420 --> 15:03.420
I like hints.

15:03.420 --> 15:09.420
Whoa.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.420
Yeah.

15:11.420 --> 15:12.420
Wait, where is it?

15:12.420 --> 15:14.420
Oh, yeah, there we go.

15:14.420 --> 15:16.420
Oh, mommy.

15:16.420 --> 15:26.420
Mommy, welcome to the stream Raiders.

15:26.420 --> 15:29.420
There's an A.

15:29.420 --> 15:30.420
Got drunk.

15:30.420 --> 15:32.420
Good night, Mercy.

15:32.420 --> 15:36.420
I love you, dear child.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.420
She's so fucking drunk.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.420
Oh, no.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.420
Sampai.

15:42.420 --> 15:47.420
Sampai.

15:47.420 --> 15:51.420
Thank you for the 420, sending ton of love your way, Mercy.

15:51.420 --> 15:54.420
You've continually been making my last few weeks better.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.420
So thanks for that.

15:55.420 --> 16:00.420
I also happen to be a resident of Manto, Illinois,

16:00.420 --> 16:03.420
but you've helped bring me some stability

16:03.420 --> 16:06.420
and something to look forward to more days.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.420
Thank you.

16:07.420 --> 16:08.420
Sampai's too.

16:08.420 --> 16:10.420
Sampai's too.

16:10.420 --> 16:11.420
Oh, my gosh.

16:11.420 --> 16:12.420
Thank you for the five gifted.

16:12.420 --> 16:19.420
Bui.

16:19.420 --> 16:24.420
I was like, I was like,

16:24.420 --> 16:31.420
oh, here's my like,

16:31.420 --> 16:35.420
here's my like breakdown again.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.420
Is there, is there something to do with these lights

16:37.420 --> 16:40.420
or are they just there?

16:40.420 --> 16:42.420
We can do okay.

16:42.420 --> 16:47.420
Oh.

16:47.420 --> 16:53.420
I don't know where K is in the alphabet.

16:54.420 --> 16:55.420
Okay.

16:55.420 --> 17:00.420
No.

17:00.420 --> 17:05.420
Wait.

17:05.420 --> 17:10.420
It's not ZK, is it?

17:10.420 --> 17:11.420
It's not in ZK.

17:11.420 --> 17:13.420
That would be so funny.

17:13.420 --> 17:17.420
You see where the text says ISZK?

17:17.420 --> 17:23.420
That would be so funny.

17:23.420 --> 17:25.420
Oh, thank goodness it's not.

17:25.420 --> 17:29.420
It would be so funny, but thank goodness it's not.

17:29.420 --> 17:34.420
I know it's like, oh, we can totally,

17:34.420 --> 17:35.420
we can totally brute force this,

17:35.420 --> 17:42.420
but I want to solve it.

17:42.420 --> 17:58.420
I want to solve it, Sampai.

17:58.420 --> 18:01.420
Oh, well, I'm so stupid.

18:01.420 --> 18:02.420
I remember.

18:02.420 --> 18:03.420
I remember.

18:03.420 --> 18:04.420
Okay.

18:04.420 --> 18:05.420
Yeah, we were, we were here.

18:05.420 --> 18:06.420
I understand.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.420
It was no understood.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.420
It was no.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.420
There you go.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.420
Wow.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.420
I for gore.

18:14.420 --> 18:15.420
I for gore, Sampai.

18:15.420 --> 18:19.420
I for gore.

18:19.420 --> 18:28.420
It's been, what, like since last week?

18:28.420 --> 18:29.420
Nampai.

18:29.420 --> 18:30.420
Nampai.

18:30.420 --> 18:32.420
Thank you for the super chat.

18:32.420 --> 18:33.420
Chrono time.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.420
Thank you.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.420
You make the long days better.

18:36.420 --> 18:39.420
Thank you, Mercy.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.420
I for gore.

18:42.420 --> 18:43.420
Correct input.

18:43.420 --> 18:47.420
Lock deactivated.

18:47.420 --> 18:49.420
This is my fault for like,

18:49.420 --> 19:01.420
what's the word?

19:01.420 --> 19:16.420
Oh, hey.

19:16.420 --> 19:22.420
Oh, wait, it's different than a duplicate.

19:22.420 --> 19:28.420
It's an evolved heaven smile with boosted explosive power.

19:28.420 --> 19:32.420
You got to take it out before it gets too close.

19:32.420 --> 19:33.420
They're crazy.

19:33.420 --> 19:34.420
I'm telling you.

19:34.420 --> 19:38.420
They'll be on top of you the moment you open the damn door.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.420
Wait, can you say that again?

19:40.420 --> 19:53.420
With this time, like more, more sash, sashual?

19:53.420 --> 19:54.420
Okay.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.420
This is where the queen is.

19:55.420 --> 19:58.420
It's different than a duplicate.

19:58.420 --> 20:04.420
An evolved heaven smile with boosted explosive power.

20:04.420 --> 20:09.420
You got to take it out before it gets too close.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.420
They're crazy.

20:10.420 --> 20:11.420
I'm telling you.

20:11.420 --> 20:16.420
They'll be on top of you the moment you open the door.

20:16.420 --> 20:37.420
Well, shit, stairs.

20:37.420 --> 20:42.420
Senpai, I might be fucking stupid.

20:42.420 --> 20:48.420
I might be fucking stupid.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.420
He said a door.

20:49.420 --> 21:00.420
As soon as you get through the door, there was no fucking door.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.420
I was like, what fucking door?

21:03.420 --> 21:05.420
I'm going back.

21:06.420 --> 21:16.420
I forgot how to heal.

21:16.420 --> 21:25.420
Blood recovery.

21:25.420 --> 21:29.420
Okay, there we go.

21:29.420 --> 21:38.420
Okay.

21:38.420 --> 21:40.420
Door equals stairs.

21:40.420 --> 21:55.420
When he said door, I was like, oh, door, door, not stairs, corridor.

21:55.420 --> 22:05.420
Fuck.

22:05.420 --> 22:10.420
Fuck.

22:10.420 --> 22:12.420
Am I kind of stupid?

22:12.420 --> 22:14.420
Yes.

22:14.420 --> 22:24.420
I didn't realize there was another corridor.

22:24.420 --> 22:25.420
Which?

22:25.420 --> 22:27.420
Which one?

22:27.420 --> 22:32.420
There you are.

22:32.420 --> 22:37.420
Okay, we're good.

22:37.420 --> 22:42.420
I'm baffled by angles.

22:42.420 --> 22:46.420
Can I go into Hyraman's room?

22:46.420 --> 22:48.420
Oh.

22:48.420 --> 22:49.420
Hi.

22:49.420 --> 22:53.420
I'm on a go to the television now.

22:53.420 --> 23:05.420
And please take the blood.

23:05.420 --> 23:08.420
I can't save here, but I have some serum.

23:08.420 --> 23:13.420
So I can...

23:13.420 --> 23:18.420
I want to use my skills.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.420
Let's do some...

23:20.420 --> 23:24.420
I think I should put in criticals now.

23:24.420 --> 23:27.420
Yeah, yeah, fuck you.

23:27.420 --> 23:29.420
Yeah, I can do counter attacks.

23:29.420 --> 23:32.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:32.420 --> 23:43.420
And speed or waver or power.

23:43.420 --> 23:58.420
Waver is the wiggliness.

23:58.420 --> 24:11.420
No, no, I don't have enough to have more power.

24:11.420 --> 24:17.420
Maybe less wiggly, so we'll do the waver.

24:17.420 --> 24:20.420
Okay.

24:20.420 --> 24:22.420
Counter attack.

24:22.420 --> 24:29.420
Okay, cool.

24:29.420 --> 24:39.420
No, I did not.

24:39.420 --> 24:59.420
Okay, we need any more blood now.

24:59.420 --> 25:01.420
Ah, shit, which...

25:01.420 --> 25:03.420
Which way did I go?

25:03.420 --> 25:08.420
I forgot again.

25:08.420 --> 25:24.420
Whoo!

25:24.420 --> 25:27.420
The other way, wasn't it?

25:27.420 --> 25:38.420
It was the other way.

25:38.420 --> 25:40.420
Oh my gosh.

25:40.420 --> 25:45.420
You scared me, bondage son.

25:45.420 --> 25:49.420
Iwa, Iwazaru.

25:49.420 --> 25:52.420
Master, we're in a tight spot.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.420
Things are turning in a bad way.

25:55.420 --> 25:58.420
An infamous criminal lies this way.

25:58.420 --> 26:01.420
And he's protecting him.

26:01.420 --> 26:04.420
Wicked bad partners, indeed, indeed.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.420
Ah, yes.

26:06.420 --> 26:08.420
Seek out the soul shells.

26:08.420 --> 26:13.420
With soul shells.

26:13.420 --> 26:21.420
He was sure to allow you in the name of Harman.

26:21.420 --> 26:27.420
I didn't read that fast.

26:27.420 --> 26:30.420
How fucked am I, Senpai?

26:30.420 --> 26:32.420
Wait.

26:32.420 --> 26:36.420
Let me go back.

26:36.420 --> 26:40.420
Again.

26:40.420 --> 26:42.420
And...

26:42.420 --> 26:50.420
Iwazaru, I need to look at the instructions again.

26:50.420 --> 26:59.420
Okay, master, blah blah blah.

26:59.420 --> 27:01.420
Blood is scary stuff.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.420
Without blood, there is no tomorrow.

27:03.420 --> 27:06.420
Because how do I do the special again?

27:06.420 --> 27:09.420
Personas can absorb the blood out of the enemy.

27:09.420 --> 27:14.420
Access stabilizer to help handle multiple personalities.

27:14.420 --> 27:19.420
Without blood, your very life is in danger.

27:20.420 --> 27:28.420
Press start slash pause to check blood volume.

27:28.420 --> 27:32.420
You must use blood wisely in the name of Harman.

27:32.420 --> 27:35.420
Special aim plus Y button three times plus shoot.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.420
Oh yeah!

27:37.420 --> 27:43.420
Let me just refresh it again anyways.

27:43.420 --> 27:50.420
Yeah, Dan's special attacks.

27:50.420 --> 27:53.420
Okay, Helian Dan loves destruction.

27:53.420 --> 27:56.420
He's bound to destroy the enemy's nest.

27:56.420 --> 27:58.420
Press the Y button three times.

27:58.420 --> 28:00.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.420
Holding the gun with the R button.

28:03.420 --> 28:06.420
Free test tubes will be equipped.

28:06.420 --> 28:08.420
Use the A button to launch a demon shell.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.420
Got it, got it, got it.

28:11.420 --> 28:14.420
The red and yellow cores indicate the nest's weak points.

28:14.420 --> 28:16.420
The name of Harman.

28:16.420 --> 28:25.420
Oh, whoa, whoa.

28:25.420 --> 28:31.420
I'm starting to remember slowly.

28:31.420 --> 28:35.420
It was this holly.

28:35.420 --> 28:51.420
Where's the yellow? Oh, there it is.

28:51.420 --> 28:54.420
That was just me practicing, yeah.

29:06.420 --> 29:13.420
Yeah.

29:13.420 --> 29:17.420
Hello.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.420
Gatekeeper.

29:19.420 --> 29:24.420
Gatekeeper, girl boss, gaslet.

29:24.420 --> 29:28.420
Hi.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.420
Next please.

29:30.420 --> 29:34.420
Where to?

29:34.420 --> 29:37.420
Do the vinculum gate?

29:37.420 --> 29:40.420
Let me take those.

29:40.420 --> 29:42.420
Yes, R received.

29:42.420 --> 29:51.420
Go right inside.

29:51.420 --> 29:59.420
Nah, I got it.

29:59.420 --> 30:06.420
Lost fight.

30:06.420 --> 30:10.420
Fuck it.

30:10.420 --> 30:17.420
Wait, this music poppin'.

30:29.420 --> 30:40.420
Yeah.

30:40.420 --> 30:47.420
It's a pop.

30:47.420 --> 30:57.420
Hello.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.420
Hi, it was Aru.

30:59.420 --> 31:03.420
Master, we're in a tight spot.

31:03.420 --> 31:06.420
Ain't even funny how tight it is.

31:06.420 --> 31:10.420
Once you open the door, there's no turning back, master.

31:10.420 --> 31:16.420
Well, you can come back, but I mean that's the gravity of the situation.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.420
Don't get me wrong.

31:19.420 --> 31:21.420
Like a prelude to later battles, you know?

31:21.420 --> 31:24.420
You must take it very seriously.

31:24.420 --> 31:45.420
The name of Harmon.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.420
Please help me.

31:47.420 --> 31:49.420
That monster is quick as lightning.

31:49.420 --> 31:52.420
I tried my best to run away,

31:52.420 --> 31:55.420
but it caught up with me anyway.

31:55.420 --> 32:00.420
Hey, kill it before it explodes.

32:00.420 --> 32:04.420
No, I'm gonna die again today.

32:04.420 --> 32:12.420
Somebody please help.

32:12.420 --> 32:16.420
Should I?

32:16.420 --> 32:24.420
Here we go.

32:24.420 --> 32:30.420
Shit, shit. Wow, speed smile, huh?

33:00.420 --> 33:05.420
Oh, shit.

33:05.420 --> 33:10.420
Oh, shit.

33:10.420 --> 33:15.420
Oh, shit.

33:15.420 --> 33:20.420
Oh, shit.

33:20.420 --> 33:25.420
Oh, shit.

33:25.420 --> 33:32.420
Oh, shit.

33:32.420 --> 33:40.420
So we better go to Harmon's room.

33:40.420 --> 33:43.420
Okay, okay, okay.

33:43.420 --> 33:46.420
Spot A.

33:46.420 --> 33:54.420
Yes, we overwrite this file.

33:54.420 --> 33:57.420
We need anything else?

33:57.420 --> 34:09.420
Probably not, but I do have a save file just in case.

34:09.420 --> 34:15.420
Let's get in.

34:15.420 --> 34:19.420
Permission to help if you need it, only if I need it.

34:19.420 --> 34:23.420
They got cameras.

34:23.420 --> 34:26.420
Wait.

34:26.420 --> 34:34.420
Am I gonna be okay?

34:34.420 --> 34:44.420
Is Garcia gonna be okay?

34:44.420 --> 34:47.420
Hello talk. Oh, there you are.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.420
Don't be shy, Amir.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.420
Who would have figured you'd be the only survivor?

34:52.420 --> 34:56.420
Anyways, are you getting along with the chief?

34:56.420 --> 34:58.420
Straight up, I was waiting for you the whole time.

34:58.420 --> 34:59.420
Yeah, I know.

34:59.420 --> 35:02.420
Don't be mad at me, man.

35:02.420 --> 35:05.420
Don't glare at me like that.

35:05.420 --> 35:07.420
The chief will wake up.

35:07.420 --> 35:10.420
Really, I'm sorry.

35:10.420 --> 35:15.420
The other chief must be rolling on the floor with laughter.

35:15.420 --> 35:21.420
Hello talk.

35:21.420 --> 35:32.420
Vision ring? What does vision ring do?

35:32.420 --> 35:39.420
I think we'll be fine to understand what he's doing.

35:39.420 --> 35:45.420
Vision ring is how you scan for enemies.

35:45.420 --> 35:50.420
Wasn't that what I was doing?

35:50.420 --> 36:08.420
Which side should I go first?

36:08.420 --> 36:13.420
There's two hallways now.

36:13.420 --> 36:19.420
Large hall?

36:19.420 --> 36:23.420
Hmm?

36:23.420 --> 36:27.420
Wait, who the fuck is this?

36:27.420 --> 36:29.420
Samantha's sitcom.

36:29.420 --> 36:31.420
Not sitcom?

36:31.420 --> 36:35.420
Please, be careful, sir.

36:35.420 --> 36:39.420
Where did she come from?

36:39.420 --> 36:44.420
Am I holding a giant harman?

36:44.420 --> 36:48.420
That's the harman?

36:48.420 --> 36:52.420
I'm the mother of this sacred place.

36:52.420 --> 36:56.420
Our four children served their purpose.

36:56.420 --> 36:59.420
They didn't die.

36:59.420 --> 37:03.420
But our other nine children were killed by you.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.420
What do you want from us?

37:06.420 --> 37:10.420
Is it so bad that we have a purpose in life?

37:10.420 --> 37:13.420
We are only serving our gods.

37:13.420 --> 37:17.420
At Heaven's command, we will kill the unwanted.

37:17.420 --> 37:21.420
Let's get rid of bad trees from their roots.

37:21.420 --> 37:25.420
I hope you are not one of them.

37:25.420 --> 37:33.420
A white child gets past your bedtime.

37:33.420 --> 37:37.420
Oh my gosh.

37:37.420 --> 37:50.420
Holy shit, he's got a huge gun.

37:50.420 --> 38:05.420
Is this locking on?

38:06.420 --> 38:09.420
You think you killed me?

38:09.420 --> 38:10.420
Better think again.

38:10.420 --> 38:14.420
You have a different voice!

38:14.420 --> 38:16.420
You have a what?

38:16.420 --> 38:24.420
There's faces on your back!

38:36.420 --> 38:47.420
Wait, I can move!

38:47.420 --> 38:48.420
Bye!

38:48.420 --> 38:50.420
I can move!

39:05.420 --> 39:24.420
Kind of creepy.

39:24.420 --> 39:52.420
Bye!

39:52.420 --> 39:53.420
Yes!

39:53.420 --> 40:04.420
I got one of them!

40:04.420 --> 40:05.420
Yes!

40:05.420 --> 40:18.420
Got another one!

40:18.420 --> 40:25.420
Come on, come on.

40:25.420 --> 40:36.420
No wait, too soon.

40:36.420 --> 40:52.420
Oh shit!

40:52.420 --> 41:01.420
Come on.

41:01.420 --> 41:21.420
I'll go!

41:21.420 --> 41:22.420
Yes!

41:22.420 --> 41:36.420
One more!

41:36.420 --> 41:51.420
Not one.

41:51.420 --> 42:01.420
There we go.

42:01.420 --> 42:19.420
Oh shit.

42:19.420 --> 42:26.420
Revolver moment!

42:26.420 --> 42:40.420
It's not easy to aim like this.

42:40.420 --> 42:47.420
Yes, we got it!

42:47.420 --> 43:04.420
Ah!

43:04.420 --> 43:10.420
Is this the way?

43:10.420 --> 43:16.420
Oh look, I'm wheeling!

43:16.420 --> 43:36.420
They see me rolling, they hate me, they're trolling.

43:36.420 --> 43:42.420
Again!

43:42.420 --> 43:48.420
I thought I killed you, bitch!

43:48.420 --> 43:58.420
Hi, slot!

43:58.420 --> 44:03.420
Oh sorry, I forgot I had to hold this.

44:03.420 --> 44:08.420
Who's that thing popping around?

44:08.420 --> 44:25.420
Where's the guy?

44:25.420 --> 44:34.420
Got it.

44:34.420 --> 44:40.420
Alright, guy from Tekken.

44:41.420 --> 44:52.420
Ah yes, nothing has changed for 30 years, no matter how many times you try, the result will be the same.

44:52.420 --> 44:59.420
Ah yes, like our chess games, you always seem to win.

44:59.420 --> 45:15.420
You're a bad player, senpai.

45:15.420 --> 45:28.420
You're a good friend, but unfortunately, our interest is not mutual.

45:28.420 --> 45:36.420
We both have become burdened with so much, and we don't have time for fun anymore.

45:36.420 --> 45:41.420
There's always time for fun.

45:41.420 --> 45:57.420
Let's dance.

45:57.420 --> 46:00.420
Did I hit his hand?

46:00.420 --> 46:08.420
Oh weeeeee! Why did he fly?

46:08.420 --> 46:22.420
Why did he fly like that?

46:22.420 --> 46:28.420
Okay!

46:28.420 --> 46:32.420
What's a PDA again?

46:33.420 --> 46:39.420
What's a PDA again?

46:39.420 --> 46:43.420
Personnel device something?

46:43.420 --> 46:47.420
Personnel digital assistant, thank you. Personnel display.

46:47.420 --> 46:51.420
Angel complete! We finished!

46:51.420 --> 46:56.420
Exterminated heaven smile.

46:56.420 --> 47:07.420
Okay, that's okay.

47:07.420 --> 47:14.420
The day when laughter disappears from this world draws near.

47:14.420 --> 47:18.420
Continue to sunset.

47:18.420 --> 47:23.420
I was three off from the coveted number.

47:23.420 --> 47:25.420
No laughs?

47:25.420 --> 47:35.420
Oh yeah, I didn't laugh this time.

47:35.420 --> 47:45.420
Almost funny number means it wasn't funny, therefore I didn't laugh.

47:45.420 --> 47:54.420
2010 winter.

47:54.420 --> 47:59.420
Look I can move these, look I can move it.

47:59.420 --> 48:04.420
Is that sunset?

48:04.420 --> 48:07.420
Not funny, didn't laugh.

48:07.420 --> 48:11.420
Is that red moon?

48:11.420 --> 48:15.420
May I ask you to think about these?

48:15.420 --> 48:19.420
Think about what?

48:19.420 --> 48:30.420
Is it these nuts?

48:30.420 --> 48:38.420
I feel like that was a lie.

48:38.420 --> 48:47.420
Oh.

48:47.420 --> 48:52.420
Wait, that sounds nice.

48:52.420 --> 49:07.420
Wait, that sounds fine.

49:07.420 --> 49:13.420
Wait, ideology?

49:13.420 --> 49:21.420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no.

49:21.420 --> 49:26.420
That's not peace!

49:26.420 --> 49:33.420
In the year 2002, a network of intercontinental expressways bridging the Atlantic Ocean opened,

49:33.420 --> 49:37.420
connecting the two major sides of the world.

49:37.420 --> 49:39.420
We have to drive

49:40.300 --> 49:47.700
The construction of a mass-scale distribution system began and the man-made landmass as large as a city

49:48.140 --> 49:50.140
Was built over an ocean

49:50.460 --> 49:59.220
The use and research of nuclear energy was banned and all radioactive waste and materials were disposed of where at an energy

49:59.340 --> 50:05.340
Disposal facility in the Gibbs soft islands. Is that good set of islands off the coast of the Indian Ocean

50:05.740 --> 50:13.580
Is this anime international eyes were on the elimination of the intercontinental missiles that posed the biggest threat to world peace

50:15.060 --> 50:17.700
In order to eliminate these weapons of mass destruction

50:18.340 --> 50:23.660
They were launched outside the Earth's atmosphere and intercepted by other missiles

50:24.380 --> 50:26.380
Exploding them on contact

50:26.980 --> 50:33.300
People around the world watch these explosions light up the sky as if they were some kind of dazzling light show

50:34.300 --> 50:41.580
These explosions later known as the missile show missiles became the symbol of world peace

50:43.020 --> 50:47.380
Wait, isn't that kind of violent for a world peace new threat was on the rise

50:49.380 --> 50:58.660
At the signing ceremony of the UN's world security treaty in the year 2003 a new breed of terrorists who called themselves

50:59.620 --> 51:01.620
smiling faces

51:03.420 --> 51:07.620
The devastating attack caught the international society by surprise and

51:08.340 --> 51:11.180
temporarily crippled key operations in the United Nations

51:13.220 --> 51:18.220
That assault was aimed at nothing other than using terrorism to create terror

51:18.620 --> 51:22.460
Well fear spread throughout the nations like people die when they are killed

51:22.900 --> 51:27.300
There was nothing the police of the military could do to counter the smiling faces

51:28.380 --> 51:32.980
The only one who had any chance of stopping these smiling faces

51:33.460 --> 51:37.580
Were the omniscient and almost godlike professional assassins

51:38.940 --> 51:45.500
The key players behind the scenes of the four powers utilized their connections and called upon the group known as

51:49.460 --> 51:51.460
Killer seven

51:52.300 --> 51:59.340
Their only hope rested with them. Oh my gosh, they title dropped it

52:03.300 --> 52:07.380
Yes, the election is right. Yeah, have you decided on your vote? Yeah

52:12.620 --> 52:14.620

Done wait, look at this. Yeah, we're looking what is this a bug in the system. No, sir

Disappear off the map. Do you have the impact point yet? Yes, sir. It's Japan. What are the fireworks ready?

57:21.900 --> 57:28.420
No, forget it. Japan is our ally. No, we're not authorized to make that kind of decision forget authorization

We have to do something now or else. We goodbye Japan happen get the president on the line

This is an emergency call for the president

57:44.420 --> 57:46.700
Mr. President this is Spencer speaking sir

57:47.780 --> 57:54.580
200 pulsars have been fired towards Japan. We're unable to compute their trajectory since we're avoiding the computation time lag

57:55.380 --> 58:00.020
Interception can only commence two hours before initial impact

58:02.180 --> 58:07.540

59:25.940 --> 59:27.380

Use the white button while holding the gun with the R button

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:29.060
And use one test tube this creates a custom magnum shell

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.820
Sure, it's banned by international treaties

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:36.580
But it's just the thing to take out the enemy

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.300
In the name of harman

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.180

You have to power up our personas weapons persona

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.660
Or the enemies will have the best of us

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.380
Rumor has it

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.620
Some enemies don't explode

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.460
Keep taking the hordes out

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:40.500

Senpai, uh, I was seeing screenshots of smt-5 vengeance

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.460

Uh, whatever the apocalypse one and I was just like

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.100
I I have mixed feelings about it, you know

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:27.940
I have mixed feelings it got it gave me motion sickness, but I might be able to do it if there's no motion if I can do it again

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.180
Yeah, motion sickness strikes again, I think I liked four because it was on the ds

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.140
I

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.940
About smt-3 remaster

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:50.900
Did that game give you motion sickness? Oh, not as much. It didn't give me as much motion sickness

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:57.380
But but I wasn't really moving in this like kind of open world thing. I guess

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.460
So, yeah

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.780
So does playing in windowed mode help? Um

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:17.380
Not really not really to be honest

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.020
Um

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.620
Not really

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:34.020
It doesn't matter what side I think a smaller screen is better though, but it's still kind of like oh, I'm still kind of dizzy, you know

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:40.660
Um, I don't like smt-3 that much because it's really punishing and hard

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:47.380
I'm a baby. I'm a baby when it comes to gaming. I want my games to be relaxing and easy

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.700
so that's why I play on easy mode and then

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:55.380
Don't tell other smt fans that I play on easy mode because it's uh

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.820
I like I like I like relaxing and going with the story and then

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.820

Before I continue well, I'll put this back back down by the sink and then if I need it again, I'll just pick it up again

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:28.100
so um

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:33.140
Yeah, my arm is very very very itchy. It looks so much better

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.700
Than it did like two days ago

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:38.580
Senpai like two days ago

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:42.420
It looks so bad. It looks so bad. I was like

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:50.580
Luckily all the games I was playing were like super easy or like could be played with one hand

01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.340
Like you know

01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:04.180
Any like walking stuff or like visual novels. It's just like dun dun dun dun dun. This one requires me to be actually you know

01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:07.540
Good

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.740
So

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:19.700
Um, I was able to like rest my ice pack beside me and then kind of like just play with one hand

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.900
But um

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:33.780
Maybe you should change the schedule then uh, I still want to play killer seven

01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:40.580
We'll just have to ice it so my arms when they flare up like they get so hot

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:45.780
That the ice melts that the ice melts and I can't even feel that the ice pack is cold

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:49.780
But if I put it like on my leg or something it's it's like oh, it's cold

01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.500
But it feels like

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.340
It's not

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.340
When I put it on

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:58.340
It doesn't even feel cold

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.500
Uh

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:07.460
Fortunately killer seven isn't very intense. Yeah, it's not intense, but I it still requires two hands

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:22.900
But um, yeah, the doctor was checking the rest of my body to see if uh

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:24.340
Uh

01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:30.900
If she could see if there were any anywhere else that it happened and she's like, oh, yeah, you got some on your legs

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.980
and

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:36.740
Uh, as I was at the doctor, I was like rashing up on the other side

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:40.260
On the other arm. I was like, ah

01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:47.380
You know, I have a fever call. Hi. That's the first thing I checked. The first thing I checked was okay now. It's cold. Um

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.380
Um

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:54.820
The first thing I checked and mama mama mercy checked was uh

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:00.180
Was was to see if I had a fever

01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:04.340
And

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.300
And uh, she was like, oh no, no

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.140
There's no fever. So we're good there

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:16.340
Time to wash everything in your life. Trust me. I already did

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:19.460
Uh, right now my my bed sheets are in

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.420
the laundry

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:26.500
Do you ever find the cause of the rash? I have no idea. I have no idea senpai

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.820
I have no idea

01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.820
I literally woke up

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:36.100
And I was like my arm's really itchy. Why and then suddenly my entire arm became

01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.780
Like very quickly when I woke up

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:44.900
Became all rash and I was like panicking. I was like, oh my god. What do I do?

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:48.820
Oh

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:52.020
It's very itchy. That's probably

01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.140
the most

01:25:55.140 --> 01:26:03.380
Annoying part of it and it's on my dominant arm. I think the most itchiest parts are like at the wrist and the elbows

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.860
So that's why I was like

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:17.460
I took a shower just in case it was like an allergy like contact allergy and it was still there. So I was like, oh

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:23.780
The food allergies, um, I don't know

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:28.420
Usually if I have a food allergy, it's like the entire body

01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:31.140
goals into

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:33.140
goals until like

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.140
issue

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.460
Maybe you have bed bugs. Um

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.260
highly unlikely

01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:44.260
And I'm pretty because these are definitely not bites because I went to the doctor

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:49.060
She was like, oh, yeah allergies is definitely something allergy related

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:56.740
Um, do you use ac? Uh, no, actually it's been quite cold recently

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:00.420
No changes in washing detergents or anything. No

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.660
No, nothing

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:07.140
Thank you for the super chat charlie

01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.180
I'm not reading that

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:16.340
Sorry not right now not right now

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:35.060
Maybe new clothes. Yeah. Yeah, maybe maybe it's new clothes. I mean like

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:39.300
It did happen when when uh, mama mercy

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:49.220
Mama mercy was like, oh, I'm gonna give you my old clothes

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:56.500
And I said, okay, so I got her old clothes that she wore when

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.420
Um

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:06.580
When she was like younger and then I guess I wore some of those and I don't know maybe

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:10.420
Maybe

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:14.420
It would have been that but it was like washed

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:18.020
That might be the reason

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.340
but

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.340
I don't know it could have been

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.620
the

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:27.460
Like polyester or something

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:30.740
But then that doesn't explain it because then I like took off the clothes

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:34.740
And like I haven't worn it for like days. I'm wearing my old clothes

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.940
Right now I'm wearing

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.100
A really ugly dress

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:44.260
This is like one of the things that I'm just like, oh, well, this shouldn't hurt

01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:00.260

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:12.420
It's like well, it's one of mama's old clothes. It's like paisley. It's like purple paisley

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:21.300
But yeah

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.460

Um, it can have it's like, you know the neck bombs

Mm-hmm, but the moment you step out of those town those town boundaries or if you go underground

I will know the moment that signal is lost. Kabooie

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.300

You can it's include it's included in the next town

01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:46.020
Like big metropolis

01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:51.700
Uh town or boonies town. Oh half and half

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:55.380

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how like what normal is it has a downtown

I don't know. I wouldn't call it a city. I wouldn't call it a city. I would call it like a town still

01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.260
Oh man

01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:04.420
A principality, I don't know like it still has like malls and stuff so

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.700
buildings

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.820
But I don't think it's particularly huge, you know

01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:17.620
I don't think it's particularly huge. It'll be like, I don't know. I would still consider it a town

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:25.220
Then again huge my differ between people

01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:47.380
Basement is all we need. Is there a population minimum we're considering? Uh, I don't know

01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:54.020
I don't know maybe 500,000 700,000 is a town, right?

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:08.660
And I trade the tracker in and instead be a house husband

01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:12.500
I know how to cook. What can you cook? What is your best meal?

01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:14.660

01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:16.660
okay, well

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.380
Make sure your liver's okay if you're drinking

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.300
A town is about 10% of that. Oh

01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:28.980
Okay, then the next city over you'll have so much ability to move

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:44.980
I may not be able to cook but I have great credit score and stable mental health

Can make appointments and phone calls and I can drive so I don't know one step closer

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:31.140

There are several laughs that I have

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:08.500
I think

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:21.780
I've been called a windshield wiper. I've been called a squeaky door. I've been called a dolphin

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:36.020
Are you an aggressive driver? Not particularly. I consider myself a defensive driver

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:41.620
T kettle is what I think of I think most people say it's windshield wiper

01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:54.820
Or like, you know, when you put windex on a cloth and go squeak squeak squeak, that's what some of my laughs sound like

01:42:54.820 --> 01:43:08.900
Find your laugh really cute. Thank you. I feel like it's one of my, um, charm points

01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:13.940
Charm points? Yeah, I think it's one of my charm points

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:16.820
Sometimes I sound like a creaky door too

01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:18.900
I

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:28.740
It's one of my charm points definitely something that uh people take notice of even IRL

01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:42.500
Uh, I don't know what my other charm points are my inability to read

01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:51.060
Okay, we're almost done Senpai. Sorry. Sorry about that

01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:59.300
We're almost done

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:06.180
Oh

01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:13.780
I think my other charm point would be

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:20.980
Uh, I guess maybe you've noticed I make a lot of mouth noises

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:26.900
A lot of mouth noises where it's like

01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:45.620
You're also the first VTuber that plays SMT outside of persona. That's hella charming. What is my charm point the type of games I play?

01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:59.540
That can't be that can't be it, right? My gamer scores might it's my um

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:04.820
It's my charm point only if you play knock turn on normal

01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.980
Uh

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:17.380
Part of it I've never seen anyone play harvester I

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:24.740
Seriously, I feel like I played very early on and when I started streaming

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:30.500
Uh, that's such a long time ago when I say such a long time ago. That's like three years

01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.460
three years ago, um

01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:37.620
I

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:46.180
Play nothing about pointing clicks. So now I'm running out of pointing clicks. I'm running out of pointing clicks to play

01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:54.260
I mean I could play it again, but I don't know it just loses this magic if you like play again

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.980
I mean with the crowd I think

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.700
I

01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:10.100
Can't play visual novels next I have

01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:12.900
two visual novels

01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.900
that I want to I want to read

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:18.420
with senpai one is completely uh

01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:24.420
Not great

01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:34.020
One is completely not great and probably would be a turnoff to a lot of people, but I'm waiting for uh

01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:37.460
Oh

01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:42.820
It's an ad friendly. No, I'm waiting for the uh, hold on

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.500
Streams

01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:51.780
And the other one I'm thinking is dona dona

01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:54.580
Uh

01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:06.180
But the other one is uh

01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:10.020
Is uh

01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.620
Poilet stuff

01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:17.140
Let's just say that

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:25.620
It's a bit it's a funny considered the worst one of the worst vns

01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:29.940
Ever made

01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:36.260
It's not great, but it is comedic

01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:47.700
It is comedic and it's really gross. It's really gross

01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:54.260
I think some of you already know it. I see it in chat already

01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:02.100
I see it in chat already. I think it'll be funny at least

01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:05.060
It's gross

01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.740
But funny

01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:10.900
So I think that'll be an interesting stream

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:13.940
Definitely not one where you're like

01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:19.220
I'm gonna jork it's more like morbid curiosity

01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:24.180
I'm gonna I'm that's my

01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:28.020
That's my

01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:38.660
You know assumption my assumption

01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:54.020
My assumption I mean like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna shame you for what you like but at the same time

01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:56.340
I'm going to guess

01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:58.340
It's

01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:01.780
Not exactly like a a a a

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.660
It's one that people are going to miss out on yes, just because of the subject

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.340
Just because of the subject so I think that one is

01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:20.580
For fun and I definitely don't expect anyone to be like

01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:23.460
I'm I'm cumin

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:26.420
I don't expect anything

01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:32.340
Anyone to be like I'm cumin and I'm expecting a much less big audience for that one than my other ones

01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.460
I'm also interested in playing. Um

01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:38.660
Some really gory ones

01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:43.140
Like I think what was it megad bites bites is that one?

01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:47.140
Uh and

01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:49.620
I

01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:51.940
Megan baits. Yeah baits. Yeah

01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:57.220
Um

01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.500
And

01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:06.740
Maybe muvelove muvelove I hear muvelove is like one of those games that it's like a must to play

01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:13.380
Well the stream is on the other platform be paywall. No it will not

01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:15.780
uh

01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:18.500
I'm planning what I'm planning for the other stream

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.660
Is uh for a little funsy onesie

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:31.300
Um, it's free as long as you follow because we don't want any uh, we don't want any trouble

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:38.020
We don't want any twubble right so it's free if you follow and uh

01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:41.140
With some incentives

01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:43.700
Yeah

01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:47.860
With some incentives

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:50.900
For donations very uh

01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:57.220
Interactive incentives, yes

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:07.940
But yes, it will be free

01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:11.780
It will be free. I don't plan on like

01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:17.060
Paywalling that it's a streaming site. I feel like it's it shouldn't be pay walled

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:23.380
Incentives to help keep the vibes, yeah

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:28.580
Yeah

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:31.140
Yeah, the good vibes going

01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:37.620
We're free of course

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:41.140
Um, but you have to in my plan my plan is that you have to follow

01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:48.420
And also, um, I don't know. I don't know but I saw a lot of people asking if like vods will be like up

01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:55.860
Uh, you see the thing is on the other website. There is no vods. There are no vods vods do not get saved

01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:08.180
So I don't think so

01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:13.540
Oh, yeah, I people are like, oh, can we watch the mods for free and I'm like, I don't even think there is vods

01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:20.020
There I don't think there is vods

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:29.860
Yeah, you recorded yourself. Yeah, I don't feel like that maybe

01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:36.420
The question is where to host it. I know. Oh, yeah, uh hosting stuff seems

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:39.220
hard

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:47.620
I'll I'll I'll talk to strongy about it. I'll talk to strongy and management about it when the time comes

01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:51.860
Because uh, right now I want to focus on my youtube stuff

01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:57.300
I want to focus on my youtube stuff or for funsies

01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.660
and also because, um

01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:03.540
You know

01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:07.700
In the end I do want to be seen as like sort of

01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:14.420
Not not I don't want to be seen as

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:19.780
A brand risk

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:27.380
Oh, okay, that sounds so bad when I say it. I don't want to be seen as like a brand risk where I I might like, um

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:29.380
Um

01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:39.700
I might I might cause some of my friends company to be like, no, no, you can't you can't collab with with her. I don't want that

01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:48.100
I don't want that. Oh, I'll wait for like 10k. Maybe I'll wait until 10k for like fans extremes. Who knows?

01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:00.100
So

01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:12.740
Yeah, I just want to be sure. Oh, what did I didn't censor? Oh man, my bad

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.820
You didn't hear that

01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:19.540
um

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:25.700
I don't want I don't want to like, uh, I don't want to make people uncomfortable, right? Like public a public facing

01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:27.700
I want to be seen as

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:36.100
Uh pretty decent, but uh privately. I'm just uh in alternate places. Uh, we're free. We got free reign. We got free reign

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:44.420
You got free reign

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:53.780
You only stream on youtube. Yeah, I only stream on youtube. Yeah

01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:57.540
Anything that I said before that was all fake fake news

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:03.460
Um

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:07.300
Yeah, I just want to make sure that when it comes to corpals because I have a lot of friends

01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:10.020
in like different corporal

01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:17.860
Which I I would love to you know, uh

01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:25.780
It was uh

01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:28.580
Definitely something that I want

01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:33.700
I want to like hang out with my other friends and I don't want to become like a brand risk where it's like

01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:37.060
Oh, I can never work with my friends ever again, you know

01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:45.140
But I definitely don't mind having that other image. Uh

01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:51.460
Behind behind places where if you want that content you search for it

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.500
That's kind of thing

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:05.300
Viola is kind of a brand risk in itself. I think personally some pie

01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:10.740
I think we're really not that different from any other, uh companies

01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:15.780
There's a lot of companies that also do uh alternate. Um

01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:18.660
asmr stuff

01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:20.180
so

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:22.180
I feel like um

01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:24.820
We're not

01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:27.140
Really different from any other company. Um

01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:35.700
The advertisement as we are a little bit on the the the spicier side. I feel like that's definitely to capture attention

01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:43.060
That's definitely to capture attention and we do advertise advertise it

01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:48.180
But that's the only difference

01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:50.740
I

01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:55.940
Don't think it's even as spicy or other corpse can get away with with it

01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:00.420
Yeah, it's the kind of hook

01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:08.340
It's a bit more I feel like it's not as spicy in my opinion

01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:13.220
I feel like it's quite normal

01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:20.980
Okay, okay, um senpai's I'm gonna have to go up again and put away the ice pack because it's completely melted here

01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:23.620
It's completely melted

01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:26.680
So I'm gonna put it back in the freezer

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:45.220
So

01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:15.220
So

01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:45.220
So

01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:58.420
Senpai's playing games here, okay now we now we're gaming

01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:07.320
Now we're gaming I'm sorry about the long intermission senpai. Sorry about the long intermission

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:15.720
Yeah, it looks like I I'll be able to continue playing

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:31.880
Okay, we're gonna game we're gaming

01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:37.640
I need to click on the screen

01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.120
There it is

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.400
But yeah

01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:47.800
Fruitful fruitful conversation. I hope I hope

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:52.120
That's my plan. Um, at least that's my plan

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:54.680
but if uh

01:59:54.760 --> 02:00:00.760
If management's like no or if scrawny's like, I don't know then uh all that plan gone

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:04.200
All that plan is gone

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.440
Or our might change a bit

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:10.200
Coyote

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.200

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.360

The skill is extraordinary the thief loves high places

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:21.640
You can jump like a human flea damn

02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:26.520
Shall I say a master of trespassing?

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:30.040

Okay, so this is me anything else combat. Okay, we're good

02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:43.400
It might take a little bit getting used to these guys

Idea I thought the only idea was youtube. Yeah. Yeah, you're getting it senpai

02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:59.560

Dear amir, this is a warning amir transfer hundred dollars in my account. I'm absorbing a twenty five dollar loss final offer. All right, mary

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.800
Nothing terrible has happened yet

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:19.320
It's time for you to send the money consider it a gift for me to use surprisingly the smith syndicate has many talents

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:25.720
And I ain't talking about cheap tricks like swallowing goldfish or cramming your head into a rubber glove

02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:30.280
They're on a whole other plane. I saw it with my own eyes heroes for our age

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:33.320
dan smith is a straight out of

02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:35.880
japanime

02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:42.680
Launching balls of light and shit. Yeah, you bet it blew my socks off. Heck. I wanted to shake his hand and ask for an autograph

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:48.680
But I decided to put my life first

02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:51.320
Oh

02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.000
Kai day smith sports blood from her arms

02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:03.400
What a sick sight and then what did she do? She flattened a wall right before my eyes. She must have taken out some kind of barrier

02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:08.520
That's what kai day's blood can do

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:12.920
Sometimes her arms suck blood. That's some stuff. I didn't need to see either

02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:16.200
Masked a smith is still a mystery

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:19.320
But I do know that he can do some sweet wrestling moves

02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:24.200
He was a small town pro wrestler who drew crowds to main events

02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:29.080
But just before he made his debut in the new york scene. He mysteriously disappeared

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:32.040
This is common knowledge amongst fans

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:40.360
The only thing for sure is that there's more than meets the eye and updated an update will follow johnny gar gegner gegner

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.600
gegner

02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:45.480
Contain your ear

02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:54.360
Where

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:57.080
Son of a bitch

02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:02.120
I'm in the middle of talking here

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Do you mind if I tell you straight up

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:13.240
I heard it through the grapevine number one chief. You're not the only one after the owner of this joint

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:18.120
The pan is controlled by the nash united nations party

02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:21.160
The un party goes down

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:25.000
Pan's minority party will take control

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.640
In other words the liberal party will take the reins

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.160
There's some nasty shit cooking in this restaurant

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:38.520
And it ain't mama's fried chicken

02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:45.320
The thief from south america could climb in this in a in a jiffy

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.480
What's the

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:07.880
So

02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:14.040
How many are there

02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:31.960
Oh, come on out again

02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:37.240
I

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.400
Shit is it behind me

02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.400
I forgot how to do a quick turn senpai

02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:05.080
Yeah

Shall we

02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:10.840
Be button

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:13.320
All right, I'm kind of dumb

02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:17.400
I'm kind of dumb

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:20.860
It's fine maybe

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:33.480
Oops

02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:38.440
Oh, we got the body already nice

02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:55.000
Look i'm a cleaner I can feel no remorse. Okay body to me. It's nearly as a wreck riding flesh a bud

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I

02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:06.200
Yay

02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:08.840

Okay, we're gonna put some blood in I'm gonna have to level up guys. I think I'm gonna have to level up

02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:31.960
You

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.160
You must defeat three enemies to wake him up

02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:42.920
And judge I'll take care of them

02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:45.240
You

02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:00.600
Okay, fine, we'll use him this is kind of hard

02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:14.920
I

02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:22.280
Maybe I should go back

02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:37.960
Oh, he's so slow

02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:45.800
Fuck it

02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:57.480
I wanted to use the the the the sneaking thing

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:17.240
Didn't get any blood see like I

02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.360
I have no one

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:44.920
Oh

02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:18.360
The ego has landed on the roof

02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:35.480
Anyone else

02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.320
Oh

02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:00.760
Can I use the blood to heal

02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:15.240
Oh

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.400
Was it oh, hi

02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:32.280
Well, hello Smith raining today, isn't it you know what I never go to school when it rains

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.080
But my mom doesn't understand

02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:40.120
Stupid mom without her reasons

02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:44.920
She says go to school. So I jumped down from the second floor

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:54.440
In that calm that's a compound fracture my new pulverized them all splat absolutely faux barred

02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:58.760
Took six months to heal. I got to take half a year off from school

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.560
Whoopee you forgot this didn't you?

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Watering returned

02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:20.520
Not a single classmate came to visit me in the hospital

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:25.080
Well, what about her of course she didn't come

02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:28.680
She jumped with me

02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:35.720
And I landed on top of her like the coolest thing, you know, I'll leave the rest of your imagination

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:39.240
My imagination of a killer

02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:44.760
Okay, bye

02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:55.560
Okay, I have the ring now have the ring now night

Okay, hold on there's probably some guy

02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:35.580

Did you just say you're fucked

02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:28.060
Because I felt that

02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:34.140
The hallway was I supposed to go into again? That's not the right one is it?

02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:40.300
Oh, yeah here it is courtyard

02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:02.460

The cold rain this evening is like my damn tears you hear me no not again

A blood red flower is gonna go up like a firework like tears in her in the rain

02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:04.940
Enough to the owner Fukushima to prevent it from hitting and killing everybody

02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:10.780
So chief which side are you on the homeland or japan?

02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:16.380
If you kill the owner japan goes down the toilet

02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:21.980
Are you all right with that man careful of the new enemy type

02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:26.700

02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:03.220
I'm fine

02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:06.020
If you have a minute to share good share

02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:09.460
It could open your eyes

02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:12.420
Pan doesn't have its own defense system

02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:21.220
Its survival is contingent in the United States as far as the homeland is concerned Japan is extra baggage

02:29:22.180 --> 02:29:24.940
Its usefulness as an ally is long past

02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:28.540
Straight up it ain't worth saving you see

02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:33.820
That's reality for you so chief you still gonna do it

02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:36.020
You

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:42.860
Know what it's meant by fireworks. They're missiles explosion that occur when missiles

02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:46.460
Collide oh sure. It's a beautiful sight indeed

02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:50.340
But you'll only see it if the defense system is activated

02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:58.980
Really I went all the way here and all I got was Travis a

02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:53.500
Think of a way to make it happen

02:32:55.340 --> 02:32:57.340
Shoot the mask to hear more

02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:03.140
But the mask lost for thick blood

02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:07.660
I did it at once. I don't want to do it again

02:33:27.580 --> 02:33:30.580
I want I want a room soon

02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:33.100
Yes

02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:40.420
Shit hi, why are you sitting like that?

02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:46.620
Take my blood

02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:48.620
I

02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:59.740
Don't make me say it again. She's you still are an ugly fella

02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:12.500
Kevin Smith, let's awaken everyone. Yeah, I need

02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:16.580
Where should I put it in

02:34:19.340 --> 02:34:21.340
Where should I put it in some pie

02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:31.100
I think waiver power everything in power

02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:37.980
And to call

02:34:38.980 --> 02:34:44.820
You can't just ask that mercy. Why not the perfectly innocent question

02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:57.020
Fatality is still good though

02:34:57.660 --> 02:35:06.900
And I want to save point

02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:12.380

I

02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:06.740
Power lunch

02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:14.860
The owner Fukushima is mixed up in all sorts of things even the International Ethics Committee is getting involved

02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:19.860
Chief you watch yourself

02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:28.260
The ethics agents or hyenas are a motley crew of rejects, but the assassins trained in the core

02:36:28.820 --> 02:36:34.900
Now those guys are what about after the Yakumo party cabinet policy or Yakumo for short

02:36:36.020 --> 02:36:40.340
It's just a bunch of paper, but it can change the world you end party my friend

02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:44.660
I'm getting tired Senpai

02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:48.460
Oh, I'm not doing so hot though

02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:03.660

02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:11.780
Come on open your head

02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:17.500
Senpai it turned into a square

02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:41.500
There's nothing here

02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:46.660
Oh

02:37:56.900 --> 02:37:58.980
Did he just clean his shoe with his gun

02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:12.140
Wait, I'm lost wait Senpai I'm lost I didn't go this way did I?

02:38:14.660 --> 02:38:16.660
I

02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:26.540
Don't think I've been this way yet

02:38:28.780 --> 02:38:30.780
Or

02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:33.860
Yeah

02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:36.540
Block deactivated

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:38.540
I

02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:43.460
Fine I want a room

02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:50.140
I mean yes

02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:08.980
Oh

02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:14.580
Me to carry your pigeon

02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:26.260
Continuing my report Kevin Smith never fails to amaze you won't believe this but it's the straight-up truth

02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:28.900
The sucker is a real-life invisible man. Oh

02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:32.300
Plenty I teach an interesting name

02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:35.740
Why must they taught me like that?

02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:43.420
At first even I didn't believe it. This has got to be a hoax, right? Oh shit the guys for real and

02:39:44.580 --> 02:39:47.020
Then con Smith what a pain in the ass punk?

02:39:47.020 --> 02:39:53.140
I can never catch him it blows my socks off nine times. He speeds off. He disappears

02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:59.420
That's right. This appears Olympic records mean nothing with him running around

02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:02.660
Coyote Smith has a thing a

02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:09.880
Thing for being a crook, but he's not like other thugs. He's fit. He jumps like an animal incredible

02:40:10.860 --> 02:40:13.620
Athleticism not to mention he can pick any padlock

02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:20.300
Must pick this up as a method of survival in a rough neighborhood and then there's Garcia and Smith

02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:24.720
I really haven't seen much seeing him much so everything. I know is based on conjecture

02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:28.900
You and rumor has it he can spot the heavens mile a mile away

02:40:29.380 --> 02:40:35.580
This character is no joke going up against monsters like that. My investigation continues Johnny Gagman

02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:58.140
Is this the way it was Zaru you spoke to me again

02:40:59.780 --> 02:41:01.940
Master, this is bad

02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:05.140
It's just can't be good at all

02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:07.900
Be sure about that mask

02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:14.860
Master you must have doubts or I would think I'm wearing a bit. That's for sure

02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:21.420
Whenever you get in tight spot you break out your silly wrestling moves. I can't you bury the past

02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:29.240
By the way, your special size suplex move should be banned the name of Harmon

02:41:38.980 --> 02:41:40.980
Lumber essential for training

02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:47.000
All right, you know what this means mask this Smith

02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:53.420
Oh

02:42:01.540 --> 02:42:03.540
He just suplexed that

02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:11.060
What's in your right hand Chico

02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:15.220
Please don't this is just a put your arms down

02:42:15.220 --> 02:42:22.980
Oh, no, no, it's not like that this gun is it don't move amigo. Don't move amigo shoot stay still

02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:48.060
Is a kitchen cleaning up that you can lick the floor

02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:53.980
Anyway, it's the least that I can do for them the others the chef the waiters

02:42:54.220 --> 02:43:01.580
Where are they those guys with the strange smiles? You saw them. It's dangerous. Okay. Get out of here. I

Have a feeling you're up to no good

02:43:15.220 --> 02:43:17.220
I

02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:40.700
Point say point say point say point

To the mask we hear more

02:46:42.180 --> 02:46:44.180
But the mask lust for thick blood

02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:50.820
Okay, so what

But now I'm tired and I think it's a result of my nausea pills wearing off a bit I

02:55:57.380 --> 02:55:59.380
Think it's cuz of the nausea pills

02:57:27.180 --> 02:57:30.820
Drunk now, but I did read it now

02:57:33.980 --> 02:57:40.700
From boy Paisley, let's see fan art soon apparently there already is

02:57:43.860 --> 02:57:49.060
And also James obviously I have to leave at some point how am I supposed to buy nice things without money

02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:51.380
Certainly can't make things

02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:52.700
youth

02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:56.180
Make you things tied up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine

02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:04.380
And ironically tipsy to drunk. I don't remember any if tomorrow's a cheers grab more whiskey play nice

02:58:05.380 --> 02:58:07.820
And that was still still

02:58:10.740 --> 02:58:13.780
You already passed out from being drunk sir

02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:16.620
I

02:58:18.260 --> 02:58:20.260
Quit quit quit drunk

02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:23.340
How can you even see the keyboard?

02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:29.460
And so it's okay. You got this. I believe me. Thank you. So I saw the super I was the orange super

02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:33.580
I did read that one and I'm really I'm so new to this senpai

02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:40.100
I'm so new to like reading Supas and having membas. I'm just like what what is the etiquette?

02:58:40.380 --> 02:58:47.020
What is the etiquette of like doing this I know that like I

02:58:51.620 --> 02:58:53.620
Know that like a lot of people

02:58:59.020 --> 02:59:02.860
A lot of people say things for the end of stream, but I'm just like

02:59:03.540 --> 02:59:05.100
That's that's okay, right?

02:59:05.100 --> 02:59:09.420
That's okay to like kind of do some of them at the end of stream and some of them like in the middle, right?

02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:11.420
I'm not really sure

02:59:13.940 --> 02:59:15.940
And I really share

02:59:17.860 --> 02:59:19.860
It's your call really

02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:24.740
That's good to do either way. It's all about the mullet

02:59:27.140 --> 02:59:33.380
And it depends on the screen okay, cuz I'm just like oh, I don't really know

02:59:40.340 --> 02:59:42.340
I

02:59:45.340 --> 02:59:47.980
Don't really know the etiquette, but whoa, whoa, we'll see

02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:53.100
Yeah, we'll see we'll see I'll I'll I'll get it some pie. I'll get it some pie

02:59:59.900 --> 03:00:04.820
I'll get it some pie. I'm so new to this. I didn't stream on on YouTube

03:00:05.820 --> 03:00:11.620
I didn't stream on YouTube when I was streaming so this is this is all kind of new I did do some

03:00:13.020 --> 03:00:15.020
YouTube streams

03:00:15.140 --> 03:00:17.140
but

03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:19.460
They didn't have rays or anything

03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:22.820
They didn't have any of the stuff

03:00:27.980 --> 03:00:31.700
I wonder how reading soup buzz and effects engagement I have no idea

03:00:32.700 --> 03:00:35.380
The only time I kind of know about soup buzz is

03:00:36.620 --> 03:00:38.980
is with like hollow live and

03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:46.540
I don't know. I feel like that's kind of we don't play by that rule because

03:00:47.540 --> 03:00:50.020
Obviously, it's not as big of a

03:00:52.580 --> 03:00:54.580
Of a of a crowd

03:00:57.860 --> 03:00:59.860
Different standards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

03:01:01.700 --> 03:01:03.700
I

03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:10.820
Something like that, you know like

03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:17.300
I'm just a small fish I'm just a small fish

03:01:24.860 --> 03:01:29.660
I'm just a small fish in the sea of beautiful v2 birds

03:01:30.660 --> 03:01:32.660
I'm just a small fish with a

03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:36.300
strange laugh a

03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:43.580
Squawky voice and and a perchance for for murder

03:01:43.580 --> 03:01:45.580
I

03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:02.900
Perchance incline. Yeah

03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:12.620
I'll say you'll notice that I'll say sayings very wrong

03:02:14.580 --> 03:02:16.580
You

03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:23.820
Your sub count ain't gonna be small fish for

03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:30.700
Long with how fast it's expanding you won't be you won't just be a big yo won't just be a big fish soon soon

03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:32.220
You'll be jaws

03:02:32.220 --> 03:02:36.940
Am I gonna get killed and are pooned right through right through the mouth?

03:02:37.460 --> 03:02:39.460
Oh

03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:43.620
Perchance just reminded me of the essay. That's what I'm referencing

03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:51.340
I wasn't an explosion. I can't remember. Oh, man. It was an explosion, right? Wait. No spoilers

03:02:52.100 --> 03:02:54.100
Jaws has been out since

03:02:54.540 --> 03:02:56.540
Wait, how long?

03:03:00.180 --> 03:03:02.180
No

03:03:03.140 --> 03:03:09.160
You mean a second since 1975

03:03:21.140 --> 03:03:26.540
Some folks will read soup was but not the name to avoid parasocial and or compare

03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:32.380
Heditiveness also God bless autocorrect this Tim and out 11 out of 10 glug glug

03:03:32.980 --> 03:03:35.420
Thank you James for the super. I

03:03:36.860 --> 03:03:38.860

03:03:41.700 --> 03:03:44.020
Think I can say thank you for

03:03:45.260 --> 03:03:47.500

I never thought about it that way. I don't think it matters either way. Yeah, I don't know

03:04:52.500 --> 03:04:54.500

I mean I can see why I don't want I don't want some pies to be jealous

03:05:13.380 --> 03:05:15.380
Because I love awesome pies equally

03:05:15.980 --> 03:05:24.940
They don't want their names read they can always donate anonymously. Oh, that's an idea too. I

03:05:29.900 --> 03:05:36.940
Can just say add on anonymous and young young miss and young young miss. Why am I saying it with a list anonymous?

03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:40.620
Anonymous

03:05:42.380 --> 03:05:44.380
Not a non anonymous

03:05:45.380 --> 03:05:47.380
I

03:05:59.260 --> 03:06:02.620
And the question how do you manage to fit so many of us into a single cell

03:06:04.740 --> 03:06:09.820

That's my schedule, okay. Well tomorrow I have my day off

03:10:18.700 --> 03:10:20.780
So I'm gonna hang out with friends and stuff

03:10:22.580 --> 03:10:27.460
Wednesday is death mark again. Well, I know death mark is not a very popular game

03:10:27.980 --> 03:10:34.140
But I want to relax and I think that would be really really great if we we all relax

03:10:35.140 --> 03:10:37.140
Relax while I read

03:10:39.140 --> 03:10:46.860
Thursday is the untitled goose game collab with straw knee so we're going to have a lot of fun with that

03:10:49.140 --> 03:10:50.820
And

03:10:50.820 --> 03:10:57.460
Followed by that is another day off and then the uno collab which by the way my time is not correct

03:10:57.460 --> 03:11:01.900
So please check the other girls's calendars to see if it's correct

03:11:05.140 --> 03:11:08.580
Because yeah, it's not correct on my on my schedule

03:11:11.020 --> 03:11:12.420
And

03:11:12.420 --> 03:11:17.580
Then I have another day off. So I have three days off this week

03:11:18.220 --> 03:11:22.220
Hopefully I can recover my arms and my legs and stuff. I

03:11:23.340 --> 03:11:28.460
Was a game called death mark relaxing. It's not but it is a visual novel

03:11:28.980 --> 03:11:33.380
So it's not like it's not it can be played one-handed

03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:39.260
It can be played one-handed and so I don't put strain on like this this this hand

03:11:49.460 --> 03:11:51.460
So yeah, I'm trying to

03:11:53.660 --> 03:11:59.820
To to rest this arm hopefully it was it won't

03:11:59.820 --> 03:12:01.820
Oh

03:12:02.700 --> 03:12:04.700
It won't

03:12:05.820 --> 03:12:08.620
It is ill it is like a bit time though

03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:15.220
So the visual novel has like quick time events, but like I think they're kind of okay quick time events. So it's not

03:12:16.380 --> 03:12:18.060
too

03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:21.380
Not too stressful. Yeah

03:12:23.260 --> 03:12:28.340
She's rest filled Sigma. I don't know what that means. What does Sigma mean?

03:12:30.260 --> 03:12:32.260
I

03:12:33.780 --> 03:12:35.780
Yeah, quick time events are

03:12:35.940 --> 03:12:39.140
Yeah, that one there's some quick time events. I think

03:12:40.060 --> 03:12:47.020
There's a little bit at stake. So we'll see we'll see and I was not not too not too fun, but it's uh

03:12:49.940 --> 03:12:51.940
It's

03:12:52.260 --> 03:12:54.260
Oh

03:12:55.820 --> 03:12:59.980
What's the word it's it's it's a game where we can relax and I

03:13:04.780 --> 03:13:08.020
Yeah, so that's for the schedule this week

03:13:13.020 --> 03:13:19.060
I'm hoping I'm gonna figure out something so I'm hoping to open up membership streams

03:13:20.060 --> 03:13:21.660
Uh soon

03:13:21.660 --> 03:13:27.660
I don't really know what people do for them for membership streams, but I guess like you just do whatever, right?

03:13:28.060 --> 03:13:30.580
So I want to try to do a membership stream

03:13:32.860 --> 03:13:36.300
Soon so I don't know when but yeah, I

03:13:36.940 --> 03:13:39.940
Want to I want to I don't know if I'm gonna do it this week

03:13:39.940 --> 03:13:43.380
Maybe next week, but I want to try to do at least once a week

03:13:45.220 --> 03:13:47.380
At least once a week for for members

03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:50.140
Remember

03:13:50.460 --> 03:13:52.460
So that

03:13:53.740 --> 03:13:56.220
So that we can have some fun together

03:14:01.380 --> 03:14:07.220
So, yeah, I'm so so tired Senpai, I'm so sorry. I know it's

03:14:10.100 --> 03:14:12.460
Now I started the stream kind of rough and
