00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,960
okay it's okay i'm willing to reset

220
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,160

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,400
if i quit and then invite you on local co-op that should work right sure

224
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:33,600
i'm gonna hide my game too just in case my game capture now sometimes can't can't you can't see

237
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,400
that's what's clashing for some random reason take that out i don't need that in my pc

238
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,280
okay begin two player i would like to use mouse and keyboard and i will use i may use controller

239
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,160
okay we did it you need to probably swap who player one is i was player one last time i think

240
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,880
okay space bar is honk i mean you need to quickly relearn all of the

241
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:14,240
maybe are we the only one's an experience to ever have this bug before

245
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,360
you go first controller off and then join in okay we're trying we're trying okay

246
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,760

Hello, mister.

539
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,800
I'm playing with your lacrosse.

540
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:12,360
Uh, well, I do objectives. Let's see what our objectives are.

541
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,760
Make someone break the fancy vase.

542
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,360
Help the woman dress up the bust.

543
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,400
Make the man spit out his tea.

544
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,240
Get dressed up with a ribbon.

545
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,760
Make the man go barefoot.

546
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,440
Do the washing.

547
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,280
What?!

548
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,280
Are we supposed to go into, like, different gardens?

549
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,520
Oh, wait! This is the man spit out his tea.

550
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,320
Um...

551
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,160
Yeah, here's your hat.

552
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,120
How do we make someone spit their tea out?

553
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,120
That's so specific.

554
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,720
Get trapped, nerd.

555
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,800
Okay, he keeps taking his hat back, but how do we...

556
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,600
Maybe if we wait for him to get his tea, and then he won't get him.

557
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,800
Ah, I'm off work.

558
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,040
Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, agreed.

559
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:04,640
Okay, let's watch this gentleman try and have his tea.

560
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,800
Well, hello there.

561
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,240
There's a lady across the fence. Hi! Are you friendly?

562
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:11,920
Probably, no.

563
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,120
Is anyone friendly, honestly? I don't think so.

564
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,720
Special rules.

565
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,280
Oh, ribbon!

566
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,000
Ta-da!

567
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,840
Uh, uh...

568
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,280
Hello?

569
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,520
Make her break the vase!

570
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,360
Oh, the vase, the vase!

571
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,680
See this fucking thing?

572
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,120
Man, fuck this thing.

573
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,000
I'm putting this one thing in particular. Uh, everything else.

574
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,240
Oh, her wee bra's on the line.

575
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,360
I know she got wee socks as well.

576
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,880
Wah.

577
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,800
Uh...

578
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:50,040
I'm stoke. I'm stoke.

579
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,760
Hello? No, no, no, no.

580
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,840
No, hold on. The camera movement's making me a little bit deezy.

581
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,240
Oh, no!

582
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,240
Are you feeling a bit sick?

583
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,840
Yeah, just give me a moment.

584
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,800
If you feel too sick, it's okay. We can post-trap.

585
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,160
I ain't gonna force you to play if you feel sick.

586
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,840
I didn't realize the camera was so unsteady.

587
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,240
Yeah, it was just like...

588
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,720
Aw, this is so cute.

589
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,040
We can just do this in the film.

590
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:26,600
She's staring at me!

591
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,480
Is she gonna break it?

592
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,040
No.

593
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,320
Oh! Oh my god, let me dress you up!

594
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,160
Okay!

595
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,560
Oh, wait a minute.

596
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,720
Wait, that's our mare's knee.

597
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,400
That's literally our bow. That's her entire design.

598
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,360
Listen, I have a bow on my chest!

599
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,120
Exactly.

600
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,720
And technically, your bow and your skirt is your skirt?

601
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,400
Yeah, it is on the back of your skirt, as I don't...

602
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,600
Oh, there's like a wee frog thing.

603
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,720
Oh, a little inter-

604
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,440
Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to...

605
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,320
Take your thing.

606
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,240
Is it a bell?

607
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:10,200
Uh, why do you even have that, lady?

608
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,040
Is that how we break the statue?

609
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,280
Does she notice I have the bow?

610
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,280
No, I notice she doesn't have it, I promise.

611
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,400
I have the soap.

612
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,000
Wait, this is a bathroom and...

613
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,120
This is a garden, it's a bathroom!

614
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,720
Uh, no!

615
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,400
This isn't a bathtub, lady.

616
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,960
This isn't a lifeguard's seat.

617
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,600
Aw, no, that's not the meme, why is it?

618
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,040
This is a bathtub.

619
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,360
This isn't a beach, it's a bathtub!

620
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,640
Yes, yes, that's it!

621
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,280
What's in the drawer?

622
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,280
Oh, sorry about that.

623
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,040
Oh, chap, didn't really mean to do that, but hey, hold on, we're here now.

624
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,200
I love causing problems on purpose.

625
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,760
Whomp, whomp.

626
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:59,720
Whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp.

627
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,240
I don't...

628
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,120
I assume I can put it on you, essentially.

629
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,000
But...

630
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,680
What a bizarre...

631
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,080
Come here, come here.

632
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,760
I can put it on you?

633
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,280
I thought I could put it on you.

634
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,200
Oh, I'm just joined it from you.

635
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,440
Oh, we're just passing it mathematically, excuse me.

636
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,880
Oh, we're just like, here you go, no, you have it, no, you have it, no, you have it.

637
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,760
You hang up, you hang up, you hang up.

638
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,480
Uh, I don't know how to get her to break this.

639
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,320
Um, no, she's always gonna have it.

640
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,320
She goes to an idol meeting in the open, literally.

641
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,280
How, what is, maybe we go in another garden for now.

642
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,080
Wait, can we even get out of here?

643
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:49,920
Wait, we can't even get out until we progress through this stage?

644
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,960
Our section?

645
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,480
There is a gate here.

646
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,320
Hello, Mr. Gate.

647
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,400
That is not going to work.

648
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,120
Can we put this on you?

649
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,160
We have...

650
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,520
I don't know if you can.

651
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,240
I like the way we both look down at it.

652
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:16,120
We're like, hmm, hmm, that's not the way it should be.

653
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,360
Okay, why can I not put it on you?

654
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:25,440
Oh, oh, oh, you're so aggressive.

655
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,240
No, I'm like trying so hard to put it on you right now.

656
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:35,760
Maybe, oh, wait, wait, wait, oh, maybe if I move the duck, if we move the geese.

657
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,400
And you be the duck?

658
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,440
Yeah, and I'll be the, I'll be the inch.

659
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,120
Oh, I like this idea.

660
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,320
And then I stand there and then she puts it on me.

661
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:52,240
Unless you're going to constantly put it.

662
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,240
Okay, right, I'll let her pick that up.

663
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,520
And then I'm going to yank this away.

664
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,640
No, you don't care about this.

665
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,680
Okay, look, it's hidden.

666
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,480
No, I just clicked off the game and you stopped doing that.

667
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, grab the ribbon, grab the ribbon.

668
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,520
Where is it?

669
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,080
I'm trying.

670
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,520
Oh, no, you've got me, lady.

671
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,360
Wait, does she know that?

672
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,680
Yeah.

673
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,160
She knew.

674
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:27,600
That was.

675
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,640
I want the ribbon.

676
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,440
Wait, what?

677
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,280
How does she know that's not possible?

678
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,080
What is on me?

679
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,320
Fine.

680
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,640
But the game literally says to put her there.

681
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,880
The table we broke, something about the table we broke.

682
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,680
Hold on, what's up with the table?

683
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,280
We're looking at our table now.

684
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,640
This one.

685
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,880
Oh, it's how we get out.

686
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,360
We go up the table now to go into another garden.

687
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:53,760
Oh, OK.

688
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,600
You're going to move on to the next one and we can come back to this.

689
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:02,840
We'll come back to the garden as soon as we share the mister.

690
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,000
We call her Miss Crackpot because we have to crack her pot.

691
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Hi.

692
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,720
Do you have a cup of tea by any chance for us little geeseling?

693
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,440
We really like your lacrosse.

694
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,440
We do.

695
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,560
Do you want to have some tea, a bit of tea?

696
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,760
No, no tea.

697
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,560
OK, jeez.

698
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,000
It's hard to impress these people, clearly.

699
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,360
Does he have a sip of tea, maybe?

700
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,320
Come on, let's watch him.

701
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:34,800
Hello.

702
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,240
Hello?

703
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,800
He doesn't.

704
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,560
He really looking at us like, can I help you?

705
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,360
Yeah, actually, you're a mission objective.

706
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,200
We're not doing it.

707
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,280
We're not up to no good.

708
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,880
No.

709
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,720
I'm just I'm just crouching around in your garden.

710
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,320
I ain't doing nothing.

711
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,800
We're doing what we watched.

712
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,040
We're watched through the fence.

713
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,880
He can't see us, but we can see him.

714
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,400
We're we're such we're such bad geese.

715
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,960
Literally.

716
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,080
What is going on?

717
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:10,720
Night night.

718
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,000
Wait, why is he so?

719
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,760
Why is he so suspicious?

720
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,520
But yeah, he's paranoid.

721
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,840
He like can't even enjoy his tea.

722
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,480
Come on, drink your tea, sir.

723
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

724
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,320
He's rubbing his knees.

725
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,320
Rubbing his knees.

726
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,320
Yeah.

727
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,920
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

728
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,560
No, you're supposed to spell it, my good sir.

729
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,600
Did I not give you a fright doing that?

730
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,600
All right, take a sip.

731
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,160
Take it.

732
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,920
Hey.

733
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,040
Wait, that was what we wanted?

734
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,960
Wait, we wanted him to spit out the tea,

735
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,040
so he has to drink the whole thing, I think.

736
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:56,960
Was that not it?

737
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,840
No.

738
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,000
Steal his shoes.

739
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,360
Don't have to tell me to it.

740
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,280
Hi.

741
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,800
Oh, no, I didn't mean to do that.

742
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,360
I meant to steal your loafers, sir.

743
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:07,720
Sorry.

744
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,880
Yeah, I'm geeny, damn loafers.

745
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,960
Go sit down, sir.

746
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,600
Go sit down.

747
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,560
I want your shoes.

748
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:15,760
Oh, sorry.

749
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,760
Oh, he didn't like that.

750
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,720
Look at him.

751
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,960
He's taller.

752
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,040
Like, he's taller-y in us, but he's kind of not.

753
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,040
Uh, what?

754
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,040
No.

755
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,040
Oh, no, I missed my turn.

756
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,040
There, can't get enough, can you?

757
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,040
Sucker.

758
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,040
No, run.

759
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,040
Yeah.

760
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,040
Out of bounds.

761
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,040
That's right.

762
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,040
You aren't coded to come over here.

763
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,040
Only I'm coded to come over here, but you?

764
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,040
No.

765
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,040
Oh, did he just boot me because I took his shoe?

766
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,040
You don't deserve it.

767
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,040
Maybe use the big bell behind him.

768
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,040
Oh!

769
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:02,040
That makes perfect sense, actually, to do the bell when he goes for a sip.

770
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,040
Can we see him do a sip from that side?

771
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,040
One of us has to go on the other side, I think.

772
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:13,040
I think we, uh, I think we both have to do it or else we can, and...

773
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,040
We're back!

774
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,040
America Kayo, hello!

775
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,040
There he is.

776
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,040
Excuse me, madam.

777
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,040
I need the bell.

778
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,040
You're in my way, madam.

779
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,040
Madam, please refrain from getting in my way.

780
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,040
Right.

781
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,040
Oh, sorry.

782
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:33,040
Okay, that's definitely what you're supposed to do when he sips his tea.

783
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:38,040
We just need to hang around while he does his tea.

784
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,040
Okay, we're getting there.

785
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,040
We just need our handheld through the game.

786
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,040
Just a tiny bit.

787
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,040
Okay, just a tiny bit of hand-holding.

788
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,040
Right, so we need to wait until he's suspicious.

789
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,040
This is over.

790
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,040
He shouldn't.

791
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:58,040
He should drink his tea after he's done his, like, suspicious animation.

792
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,040
Oh, I'm trapped.

793
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,040
I'm trapped.

794
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,040
We're good.

795
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,040
I didn't...

796
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,040
This game is a lot harder than I thought.

797
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,040
I thought this was like a...

798
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,040
I say this about every game I play.

799
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,040
Oh, I thought this was a child's game.

800
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,040
Why is it hard?

801
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,040
Right, we're like, why is it hard?

802
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,040
Right, we're like, why is it hard?

803
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,040
Right, we're like, why is it hard?

804
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,040
Why is it...

805
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,040
No, the bell thing needs to be set up again.

806
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,040
She's not fixing it.

807
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,040
Oh, no.

808
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,040
You're right.

809
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,040
Oh, sugar.

810
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,040
What is she trying to fix right now?

811
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,040
She's currently painting.

812
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,040
I don't know.

813
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,040
I can take her painting brush.

814
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,040
Oh, I can draw her painting brush, one or the other.

815
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,040
Oh, wow.

816
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,040
Good night, Straniaga.

817
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,040
I'll wake up in four hours, bro.

818
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,040
You are going to be shattered.

819
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,040
Um, no.

820
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,040
Was I supposed to take the paper?

821
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,040
Oh, she's going to fix the bell.

822
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,040
Okay.

823
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,040
And then...

824
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,040
Do you want to put the duck in the other garden?

825
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,040
I wonder if that's what it is.

826
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,040
You put the statue in the other garden,

827
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,040
so then she forgets she even had a duck.

828
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,040
No.

829
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,040
No, no, no, no.

830
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,040
I must tell you...

831
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,040
Okay, there we go.

832
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,040
Oh, yeah.

833
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,040
Okay, it's now out of bounds,

834
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,040
so she can't ask for the duck anymore.

835
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,040
It doesn't work like that.

836
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,040
And now we wait for him to drink his dang tea

837
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,040
that must be frozen solids at this stage.

838
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,040
Because there's no way.

839
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,040
Please ask for tea.

840
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,040
Are you coming in this garden?

841
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,040
Yeah.

842
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,040
Your audio may be cutting out from me

843
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,040
on Discord a little bit.

844
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,040
Oh, sorry.

845
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,040
No, that was all good, the knee already.

846
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,040
So she knows it's fake, right?

847
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,040
She tells you to move.

848
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,040
Do I need to paint you?

849
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,040
So she's fixing that.

850
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,040
Wait, can I put the bull on you now

851
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,040
because we got rid of the statue?

852
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:13,040
No, I've done...

853
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,040
You didn't give me time.

854
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,040
Right, go paint.

855
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,040
Whoa!

856
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,040
Right, go paint.

857
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,040
Jeez.

858
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,040
Let's do this bail.

859
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,040
I want some bourbon.

860
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,040
This German.

861
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,040
Oh, he's about to do his animation.

862
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,040
Okay.

863
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,040
No, no, no, wait.

864
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,040
No!

865
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,040
He was supposed to do the drink tea animation.

866
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,040
Why?

867
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,040
Maybe this will help your mindset for the puzzle.

868
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,040
The game is meant to single player.

869
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,040
Everything can be done solo.

870
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,040
You mean we could be doing this twice as fast

871
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,040
but it's taken us three times as long?

872
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,040
Hold on a minute.

873
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,040
What's going on here?

874
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,040
These allegations.

875
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,040
Are you calling us dumb?

876
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,040
Why?

877
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,040
Because you're right.

878
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,040
Cush me.

879
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,040
Yeah, I mean, it's not.

880
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,040
Wait, water in this dish maybe?

881
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,040
I'm like trying to look around for hints,

882
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,040
but I'm like, bruv.

883
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,040
Stand on the stand when she's not looking.

884
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,040
Right, if Mercy's distracting her.

885
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,040
Okay, I've stood on the stand.

886
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,040
While she's not looking, I am doing no input.

887
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,040
As if that was it.

888
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,040
That took us so long to get the first thing.

889
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,040
Right, he's got tea in his hand.

890
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,040
I need to ring the bell.

891
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,040
Look at me.

892
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,040
I'm Mercy.

893
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,040
I have a bow.

894
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,040
Ready?

895
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,040
Yes!

896
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,040
Oh my God.

897
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,040
That's fantastic.

898
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,040
It took us so long to get one and now we have two.

899
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,040
Oh, now you have such a cool ribbon on you.

900
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,040
I know.

901
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,040
I have a bow like you now.

902
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,040
The soap.

903
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,040
What do we do with the soap?

904
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,040
Why do you have soap outside?

905
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,040
Well, she has like a bathtub and a toilet.

906
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,040
Quite literally is her decorative stuff.

907
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,040
Hold on.

908
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,040
Let me check where our objectives are

909
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,040
because I've completely forgotten that.

910
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,040
Oh, sorry, that's not objectives.

911
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:05,040
Make the man go barefoot and do the washing

912
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,040
with a bra, a pair of socks, slippers and a bar soap.

913
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,040
Right, hold on a minute.

914
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,040
Where would we do washing?

915
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,040
Right, I'm going to steal this guy's other loafer.

916
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,040
But where do we get water to do the washing?

917
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,040
Let's steal his shoe because that's super easy.

918
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,040
Hello, we would like to steal your shoe, please.

919
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,040
We do the washing in here.

920
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,040
No, it's not what it looks like.

921
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,040
We're not here for your other loafer at all, I promise.

922
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,040
I promise.

923
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,040
You can't get me.

924
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,040
Out of bounds.

925
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,040
Out of bounds.

926
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,040
Talk to the game devs because the face ain't listening.

927
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,040
Okay.

928
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,040
Oh, he won't let me in again.

929
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,040
Right, okay.

930
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,040
Well, go sit back down.

931
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,040
Because now we need to do laundry.

932
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,040
I don't really know where to do laundry.

933
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,040
Put the vase on the man's side of the garden.

934
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,040
The man will throw it back over.

935
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,040
Oh, we're just straight up getting spoiled.

936
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,040
Are you okay if we get our hand held?

937
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,040
Because I don't mind the wreaths and spoiling it for me.

938
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,040
Okay, we need to drag the purple statue all the way over.

939
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,040
We're back.

940
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,040
We can do it.

941
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,040
Don't mind me.

942
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,040
I'm strapped.

943
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,040
I'm not that fast, lady.

944
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,040
There you go.

945
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,040
I'm stuck on the fence.

946
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,040
Let me over.

947
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,040
Okay, we did it.

948
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,040
Yay.

949
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:50,040
Hello, would you like to throw this magnificent priceless vase over the fence by any chance?

950
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,040
Or vase vase?

951
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,040
I don't know.

952
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,040
Vase?

953
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,040
Like Vaseline?

954
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,040
He actually did.

955
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,040
Oh, he's going to go the other way.

956
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,040
Wait, why are you taking me?

957
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,040
He just stripped me naked.

958
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,040
Give me back.

959
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,040
I'm naked.

960
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,040
I feel so humiliated.

961
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,040
Oh, I guess we do the washing in here.

962
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,040
Oh, okay.

963
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,040
Because look, there's water.

964
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,040
Oh my God, we're swimming.

965
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,040
Wait, we need to grab the bar.

966
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,040
We need the bra and the sockies.

967
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,040
Can I quickly grab it this way?

968
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,040
Maybe I can run.

969
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,040
No, no.

970
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,040
Let's do it this way.

971
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:35,040
If she catches me, it's fine because at least you've got...

972
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,040
Wait, she's not even upset about the...

973
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,040
Okay, we're doing it.

974
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,040
We're doing it.

975
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,040
We're doing it.

976
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,040
We're doing it.

977
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,040
Turns out all we needed was someone to spell it out for us.

978
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,040
Wait, no, he's not going to throw that back over.

979
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,040
It's in the water now.

980
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,040
No, this is mine.

981
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,040
It's in the water.

982
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,040
No, no, no, no, no.

983
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,040
Don't do something.

984
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,040
Give me that.

985
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,040
It's going in the water for washes.

986
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,040
Yeah, that's right.

987
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,040
You don't want to stand in this.

988
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,040
No, these are mine.

989
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,040
There are many things.

990
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,040
No, go have your tea.

991
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,040
Why aren't you drinking tea a moment ago?

992
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,040
Go forget.

993
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,040
Forget?

994
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,040
No, no, no, no.

995
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,040
Hold on.

996
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,040
No.

997
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,040
Leave Mercy be, you fellow wench.

998
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,040
Harlan!

999
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,040
Yes, please listen to my problems.

1000
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,040
Suzuki, life is so hard as a ghost.

1001
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,040
You see, people don't...

1002
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,040
Oh, well, you are.

1003
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,040
As long as one of us picks up, that's the main thing.

1004
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,040
Grab it.

1005
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,040
I'm away.

1006
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,040
I'm away.

1007
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,040
I'm away.

1008
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,040
I'm away.

1009
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,040
I'm away.

1010
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,040
I'll grab her stuff.

1011
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,040
No, no, no, no.

1012
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,040
Stop what it looks like.

1013
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,040
I promise it's not.

1014
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,040
Right, hold on.

1015
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,040
There.

1016
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,040
I know your neighbor's with that again.

1017
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,040
Ah.

1018
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,040
Take this sock.

1019
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,040
Can you pick up that bar of soap?

1020
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,040
That's on the bathtub?

1021
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,040
Yeah.

1022
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,040
And then we...

1023
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,040
I think we're done.

1024
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,040
I think we've done it.

1025
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,040
Yeah.

1026
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,040
Taking the clothes.

1027
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,040
Right, as long as the guy doesn't take a random pair of socks off of us,

1028
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,040
I don't know why he would care that much,

1029
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,040
but I don't know where he is.

1030
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,040
And the camera isn't zoomed out,

1031
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,040
so I don't know if I'm going to run into him.

1032
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,040
Is he still...

1033
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,040
Oh, he's moved the bra out of the freaking thing.

1034
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,040
Right, let me go get that bra.

1035
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,040
Do not throw that bra over the fence.

1036
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,040
Do you understand me?

1037
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,040
Give me that bra.

1038
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,040
Give me that bra to me.

1039
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,040
I need that.

1040
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,040
I need my training bra, okay?

1041
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,040
We're doing laundry.

1042
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,040
Is this what I'm supposed to do?

1043
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,040
La, la, la, la, la.

1044
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:39,040
Wait, this wasn't what I was supposed to do.

1045
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,040
What is...

1046
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,040
Do the washing.

1047
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,040
A slipper!

1048
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:45,040
Oh, no, I'll put all the slippers out of bounds.

1049
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,040
Oh, no, I'm backfired.

1050
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,040
My plan has backfired terrifically.

1051
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,040
Hold on.

1052
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,040
Hold the line, Mercy.

1053
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,040
Hold the line.

1054
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,040
I'm coming, Mercy.

1055
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,040
Distract him.

1056
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,040
No, no, no, no.

1057
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,040
Oh, hold the line.

1058
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,040
Hold the line.

1059
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,040
Hold the line.

1060
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,040
I'm coming.

1061
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,040
I'm coming.

1062
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,040
Oh, hold the line.

1063
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,040
Oh, I'm running.

1064
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,040
I'm running.

1065
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,040
I'm running.

1066
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,040
I'm running.

1067
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,040
I'm running.

1068
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,040
I'm running.

1069
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,040
Oh!

1070
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,040
Yes!

1071
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,040
Yay!

1072
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,040
We did it!

1073
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,040
That was frickin' hard.

1074
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:21,040
You didn't make it so hard.

1075
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,040
God, that camera is so hard.

1076
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,040
To-do list.

1077
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,040
Make someone print...

1078
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,040
The prize, right?

1079
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,040
The prize.

1080
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,040
I mean, it looks like he wants to do it.

1081
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:33,040
I'm not really wanting to, like, make him do anything.

1082
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,040
What is he writing?

1083
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:38,040
Does that mean he just, like, honk when he's, you know...

1084
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,040
Oh, he hit me.

1085
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Did he make a no-geese sign?

1086
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,040
I think everyone's...

1087
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:47,040
Yeah, literally everyone's doing a no-geese every time we're finished in an area.

1088
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,040
Okay, do this.

1089
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,040
Right, he can touch the brand stuff.

1090
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,040
It doesn't matter.

1091
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,040
How do we...

1092
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,040
Is there any gardening equipment?

1093
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,040
Oh, yeah.

1094
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,040
Oh, yeah.

1095
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,040
You just closed it on my face, lady.

1096
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,040
Don't do that again.

1097
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,040
That made myself clear.

1098
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,040
Is there gardening tools in here?

1099
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,040
Hello, lady.

1100
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,040
Do you have a...

1101
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,040
The shears?

1102
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,040
Oh!

1103
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,040
I see it.

1104
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,040
And I'm messing it up terribly.

1105
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,040
Oh, this is quite heavy.

1106
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,040
I have to...

1107
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,040
Hold on, lady.

1108
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,040
Hold on, lady.

1109
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,040
Give me that.

1110
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,040
See this paint?

1111
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,040
Man, I'm terrible at this game.

1112
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,040
You know that.

1113
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,040
Can you grab those clippers?

1114
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,040
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

1115
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,040
Excuse me.

1116
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:25,040
Have you ever heard about our savior, Goose McGooseface?

1117
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,040
Very good Goose.

1118
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:31,040
One of the best Goose that lived for seven years, which is so big in Goose life.

1119
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,040
It is...

1120
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,040
Thank you for listening to my story.

1121
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:38,040
Is that how you print a rose bush?

1122
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:42,040
Well, we're giving them...

1123
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,040
We...

1124
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,040
Do we need to...

1125
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,040
Oh, I need to move it.

1126
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,040
Oh, yeah.

1127
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,040
Huh?

1128
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:55,040
That didn't do anything.

1129
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,040
Do we need...

1130
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:00,040
Is there a rose bush we need to, like, steal from her garden?

1131
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:05,040
Grab the rose pot and drag it next to the shrub, then mess up the shrub.

1132
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,040
Mess up the shrub.

1133
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,040
Excuse me, lady.

1134
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,040
You need to come back in your garden.

1135
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,040
Man, fuck the shrub.

1136
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,040
Fuck the shrub.

1137
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,040
Fuck the shrub.

1138
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,040
Fuck the shrub.

1139
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,040
You know that Nicki Minaj song that's like, hi heels on Nicki?

1140
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,040
Wait, wait, wait.

1141
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,040
And it goes, fuck the club.

1142
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,040
Fuck the...

1143
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,040
Yeah, fuck the shrub.

1144
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,040
Is that all?

1145
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,040
I mean, I'm going for it.

1146
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,040
Wait, he threw the things...

1147
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:33,040
Wait, is she going to accidentally chop off the rose?

1148
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,040
Yeah, looks like she is.

1149
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:40,040
Uh...

1150
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:45,040
She hid it behind her back.

1151
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,040
Oh, no.

1152
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,040
Do you know how long it takes to make roses?

1153
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:54,040
It's like a very hard job to have them grow successfully.

1154
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,040
It takes so long.

1155
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,040
Right, okay, let's see.

1156
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,040
We caused a...

1157
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,040
We caused a problem.

1158
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,040
Oh, no, he's...

1159
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,040
Is he crying?

1160
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,040
He said my rose.

1161
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,040
He shits the rose, revenge.

1162
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,040
Right, how do we get out of here?

1163
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,040
Oh, what's she doing?

1164
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,040
She's opening a panel.

1165
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,040
She's letting us go out this panel here.

1166
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:18,040
She said I had enough of you, geese.

1167
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,040
Sorry, are we in the way?

1168
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,040
Pardon me, lady.

1169
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:24,040
I don't know what your plan is.

1170
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,040
Oh, she got no geese as well.

1171
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:29,040
Okay, I actually kind of like that when you're finished with this section,

1172
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,040
the game's like no goose, by the way.

1173
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,040
No geese.

1174
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,040
Okay, okay, I'm out.

1175
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,040
I'm out.

1176
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,040
Jeez, I'm done.

1177
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,040
Yay.

1178
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,040
Okay, bye.

1179
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,040
Thank you, lady.

1180
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,040
What's in here?

1181
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,040
Hello.

1182
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,040
Oh, pardon...

1183
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,040
Oh, sorry, I'm just here to bring...

1184
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,040
Oh, we're just coming through.

1185
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,040
Sorry, just visiting.

1186
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,040
Oh, package.

1187
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,040
Thank you.

1188
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,040
Whose package is this?

1189
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,040
Can we open it?

1190
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,040
We can take it away with us.

1191
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:59,040
We actually don't have an objective, so we're not there yet.

1192
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,040
Is this the wrong way?

1193
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,040
I like to steal people's mail.

1194
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,040
I'm a porch pirate.

1195
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,040
Look at me.

1196
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,040
Yarg.

1197
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,040
Yarg.

1198
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,040
I'm going to post it in the wrong door on purpose.

1199
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,040
I'm going to put this one on the other person's door.

1200
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,040
Yeah, yeah.

1201
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:19,040
And then they get to talk and then they'll fall in love or something.

1202
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,040
Yeah, well, we're so good.

1203
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,040
We're such good neighbors.

1204
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,040
Okay, I literally...

1205
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,040
We need geese everywhere.

1206
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,040
Geese are actually secretly keepers.

1207
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,040
You're so helpful.

1208
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,040
We're writing fan fiction.

1209
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:34,040
Look at the lavender.

1210
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,040
Pretty flowers.

1211
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,040
We love flowers in this house.

1212
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,040
You're the prettiest flower I've ever seen.

1213
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,040
Oh, it's juff.

1214
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:45,040
I'm blushing.

1215
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,040
Oh, the camera angle is swapping every two seconds.

1216
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,040
Oh my God, there's a Benki!

1217
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,040
AC is in this game!

1218
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,040
Not this!

1219
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,040
Look at the Benki!

1220
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,040
It's for AC!

1221
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,040
Oh my God, it's for Benki!

1222
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:59,040
Wait, AC needs to play this game now just so she can walk around.

1223
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,040
Look, you're so cute now.

1224
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,040
Wait, how do I do AC's voice again?

1225
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:09,040
On today, we're going to play Goose Game with Mercy.

1226
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:17,040
Thank you, OGSans, for watching me and my kohai, Mercy and the snippets.

1227
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,040
This is a terrible voice.

1228
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,040
I cannot do AC at all.

1229
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,040
I'm trying, okay?

1230
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,040
I can't do AC.

1231
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:26,040
AC is too unique and too cute.

1232
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,040
Can't do it like a European accent?

1233
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,040
Is it too hard to mimic European accents?

1234
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,040
Of any kind.

1235
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,040
Can you do French?

1236
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,040
Did you learn French because you know,

1237
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:38,040
I didn't really learn French.

1238
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:41,040
Bonjour, salut.

1239
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,040
Like that kind of French.

1240
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,040
Oh, I've not heard your French voice!

1241
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,040
I've not heard your French voice before!

1242
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,040
Salut, merci, ça va?

1243
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,040
Ça va bien.

1244
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,040
Wow, your French voice is so cute!

1245
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,040
To jouer avec moi, on...

1246
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,040
Oh, we're at the meeting again!

1247
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,040
Look, it's the rake!

1248
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:10,040
Wait, are we done?

1249
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,040
Did we finish already?

1250
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,040
No, we couldn't have.

1251
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,040
No, we've not.

1252
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,040
Help the woman dress up the boss.

1253
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:27,040
Oh no, did we...

1254
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,040
Wait, no, but she let us go to the next area, so...

1255
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,040
Are we finished?

1256
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,040
Oh no!

1257
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,040
Oh, it makes the ground keepers wear his own hat.

1258
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,040
We don't have that.

1259
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:44,040
But we're allowed to move on?

1260
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,040
How do we make...

1261
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,040
You accidentally went back to the beginning of the game.

1262
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:51,040
Wait, so we need to go the other way to unlock the new map?

1263
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:55,040
Hold on, Ray, let's try the other...

1264
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,040
Only we would manage that, honestly.

1265
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,040
Ray, let's try that again.

1266
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,040
Let's try that again, Ray.

1267
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,040
We'll go upstream this time.

1268
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,040
It was the French, I'll burn the French this time.

1269
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:09,040
I don't know where the fuck we is.

1270
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,040
Wait, do we need to go along that bridge there?

1271
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,040
No, maybe.

1272
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:18,040
I'm swimming up the water.

1273
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:21,040
To say water in French, you say...

1274
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,040
L'eau.

1275
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,040
Why is the French...

1276
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,040
Why is water male in French?

1277
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,040
I do not know.

1278
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,040
No.

1279
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,040
Can we eat?

1280
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,040
No.

1281
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:35,040
I'm skinny buying that skinny, you know what I'm saying?

1282
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,040
You think where it matters.

1283
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,040
Yeah, exactly.

1284
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,040
That's what I like to hear.

1285
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,040
Wait, so...

1286
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:46,040
We're casually just flirting.

1287
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:49,040
I remember seeing complaints like...

1288
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:53,040
On feature group collabs, I was just turned into them being nice to each other.

1289
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,040
What, you're surprised?

1290
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:56,040
You're surprised that we're nice?

1291
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,040
What do you want me mean?

1292
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,040
Yeah, literally Scots?

1293
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:02,040
What do you want me to be like?

1294
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,040
Oh, you Canadians with your cube costs and all that,

1295
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,040
and your fake French, like what?

1296
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:11,040
Wait, so we weren't supposed to go here or...

1297
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,040
I thought this was a nice area to go to.

1298
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,040
What's the deal?

1299
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:18,040
This was the way to go, because we opened a gate to get here,

1300
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,040
and there was a new camera angle.

1301
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:24,040
Oh, well, I guess we should move this way now.

1302
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,040
Moving on up?

1303
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:29,040
Maybe it was like a shortcut to go back, I guess?

1304
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,040
A bit of Bologna.

1305
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:32,040
Okay, well, considering...

1306
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,040
Yeah, there's literally an arrow that's like...

1307
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,040
You're actually meant to go this way, dumbass.

1308
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,040
Oh, hey, a car.

1309
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,040
Let's trap someone in it.

1310
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,040
Oh.

1311
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:46,040
So this is how Mercy lured her first victim.

1312
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:51,040
This is how I heard my first victim, right, Senpai?

1313
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:55,040
I put in, like, hot girls in your area in this truck,

1314
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,040
and you just walked in.

1315
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,040
I can't believe you guys actually responded to that ad.

1316
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,040
She put up cute Yandere in your area,

1317
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,040
seeking you now two miles away.

1318
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:07,040
She's honing in on your current location.

1319
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:10,040
Wait a minute.

1320
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:12,040
Whatever objectives.

1321
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:14,040
Get into the pub.

1322
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,040
Break the dartboard.

1323
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,040
Get the toy boat.

1324
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,040
Can you say toy boat ten times?

1325
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,040
Fast?

1326
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,040
Toy boat?

1327
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,040
Why?

1328
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:29,040
Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.

1329
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,040
Wait, why does it sound like something's on there?

1330
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,040
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1331
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:36,040
Toy boat, hey, how do you say toy boat?

1332
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,040
Toy boat.

1333
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,040
Toy boat.

1334
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,040
Toy boat.

1335
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,040
Toy boat.

1336
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,040
Toy boat, toy boat.

1337
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,040
Bit of a toy boat moment.

1338
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,040
Bit of a toy boat.

1339
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,040
Like when you say, like, tin soldier or something,

1340
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,040
and then you're supposed to say it like ten times fast or something.

1341
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:57,040
Tin soldier? I've never heard tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier.

1342
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:04,040
Oh, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier.

1343
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,040
Okay, okay, I've not heard that one.

1344
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:09,040
I heard like Peter Piper picked a pick.

1345
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1346
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,040
Can you get his shoes? I want your shoes.

1347
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,040
Oh, go for his laces.

1348
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,040
Get him where it hurts.

1349
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,040
Give me that.

1350
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,040
Yeah.

1351
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,040
We're terrorizing him.

1352
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,040
Oh, I can't.

1353
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,040
This camera angle is so unforgiven.

1354
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,040
It really is.

1355
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,040
No, I keep getting pushed away.

1356
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,040
Do we need to jump in the van and scare them?

1357
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,040
Jump in the box, maybe.

1358
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:38,040
You're right.

1359
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,040
There should be another box in the van.

1360
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,040
Let's go into your secret kidnap van.

1361
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:44,040
Wait, how do we...

1362
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,040
We get in the...

1363
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,040
How do I...

1364
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,040
How do you...

1365
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:52,040
Okay, wait.

1366
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,040
Oh, no.

1367
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,040
It's only one at a time, right?

1368
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,040
You go in before me.

1369
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,040
I'll be fine.

1370
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,040
You go in without me.

1371
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,040
It's okay. We'll cause trouble with leaders.

1372
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,040
Yes, I think if you burst out of the box, maybe.

1373
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:08,040
One of you hide in the box when the woman isn't looking,

1374
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,040
close the box and wait until the delivery woman picks up the box,

1375
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,040
she will carry you inside the pub.

1376
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,040
What about me? I'll just stay outside.

1377
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,040
I'm literally waiting in line for a queue.

1378
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,040
I'm pretty sure people have to queue for nightclubs or something like that.

1379
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,040
I'm queuing to get in the pub right now.

1380
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,040
I've been to clubs a few times,

1381
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,040
and I'm just like,

1382
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,040
that's loud music.

1383
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:30,040
It's not for me, mate.

1384
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:32,040
Oh!

1385
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:35,040
I got these Tism earphones

1386
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,040
where you put in and it makes everything quieter when you go outside.

1387
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,040
If you do not have them, they are so good.

1388
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,040
I cannot recommend them enough.

1389
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,040
I will literally send you a pair.

1390
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,040
It makes going outside a heck of a lot easier.

1391
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,040
Oh!

1392
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,040
Yes.

1393
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,040
Be careful. That's goods in there.

1394
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,040
That's very valuable goods.

1395
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,040
Do I make myself clear?

1396
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:00,040
Do I make myself clear?

1397
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:04,040
Okay.

1398
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,040
There should be another box.

1399
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:08,040
Am I going to...

1400
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,040
Is the camera going to thingy out?

1401
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,040
Oh no.

1402
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,040
Can you see yourself?

1403
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,040
I can't move. I'm stuck.

1404
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,040
I'm stuck too.

1405
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,040
Did the game devs...

1406
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,040
Game devs? Hello game devs?

1407
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,040
Any game devs?

1408
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,040
Any hotpatch? Any game dev fixers?

1409
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:34,040
That is not good.

1410
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,040
I'm not sure.

1411
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:38,040
I think we might have softlocked ourselves a little bit.

1412
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,040
I'm not...

1413
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,040
I'm stuck.

1414
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:44,040
I'm stuck.

1415
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:46,040
Game bro! Game bro!

1416
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:48,040
I'm in! I'm in!

1417
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,040
That wasn't very nice of me. Where are you?

1418
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,040
I don't know.

1419
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:54,040
Oh no!

1420
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,040
Where's the grid?

1421
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,040
Mild panic.

1422
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,040
How on earth do I get to you?

1423
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,040
There's a hole in here.

1424
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,040
Yeah. What do you call me?

1425
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,040
Oh where is it?

1426
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,040
I'm reunited.

1427
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,040
It feels so good.

1428
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:14,040
Yunk yunk.

1429
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,040
Yunk yunk.

1430
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,040
Yunk yunk.

1431
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,040
Okay let's destroy that dartboard.

1432
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,040
Oh yeah! Actually we need to play...

1433
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,040
Bullseye!

1434
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:26,040
190!

1435
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,040
Oh no no! We're just...

1436
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,040
We're niceki's.

1437
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,040
We're niceki's.

1438
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,040
We're niceki's I promise.

1439
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:36,040
We're not... Oh we have little...

1440
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:38,040
Game...

1441
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:40,040
All the toss the ring stuff.

1442
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,040
Oh sorry. Were you playing that?

1443
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,040
Oh sorry. Were you playing?

1444
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,040
Yeah I think I...

1445
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,040
Oh that's the dart!

1446
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:50,040
That scream out on when he...

1447
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,040
One, two, three!

1448
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:54,040
Oh.

1449
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:56,040
I'm sorry for distracting you, Gitzer.

1450
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,040
How do we destroy that?

1451
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:04,040
Oh no I'm sorry!

1452
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:08,040
I get to play all harmonica!

1453
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,040
Hmm.

1454
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,040
Hmm.

1455
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:14,040
How do we destroy a dartboard between us?

1456
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,040
Maybe cigarette?

1457
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:18,040
Maybe we've got something similar?

1458
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:20,040
Maybe we've got something similar?

1459
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:22,040
Hmm.

1460
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:24,040
Yeah.

1461
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:30,040
Oh! There's like a little podium!

1462
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,040
I knight myself the geese of old...

1463
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:34,040
Is it a podium?

1464
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,040
Are they clapping for me?

1465
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,040
Hello?

1466
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,040
How do you open your wings?

1467
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,040
I don't know.

1468
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,040
Oh my god!

1469
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,040
They love us!

1470
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,040
Oh my god!

1471
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:52,040
I was joking about this being a podium!

1472
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,040
But we actually got a flower!

1473
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:56,040
That's so cute!

1474
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,040
Oh my god we're such good kids!

1475
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,040
We should join a circus.

1476
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:02,040
Yes we should join a circus.

1477
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,040
What?

1478
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,040
Oh that's so cute.

1479
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:08,040
Okay maybe geese girl considered for Gen 2

1480
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,040
because of how adorable these are.

1481
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,040
I'm starting to warm up to anyone...

1482
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:14,040
Suggestion to a wasp girl.

1483
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,040
A what?

1484
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,040
Oh see bug girls are an issue

1485
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:20,040
and I'll tell you why I actually developed

1486
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:22,040
mental, I don't mind telling you this.

1487
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,040
Oh really?

1488
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:26,040
Because of arachnophobia for example

1489
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,040
or insectphobia is a very real thing.

1490
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:30,040
It has a possibility

1491
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:32,040
of putting the girl at a disadvantage.

1492
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:34,040
Design wise.

1493
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,040
Yeah!

1494
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:38,040
If you didn't know

1495
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,040
I don't mind sharing this with you.

1496
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,040
But you know how you have...

1497
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,040
Oh that's nice.

1498
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,040
Oh that's it?

1499
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,040
That's it no more?

1500
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:56,040
Oh my god give them the flower!

1501
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,040
You were amazing!

1502
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,040
Oh I can't give them the flower

1503
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:02,040
he doesn't like it.

1504
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,040
You were amazing sir!

1505
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,040
You wanna play again?

1506
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:08,040
Mister?

1507
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,040
No he just wants to look at us.

1508
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,040
That's fine.

1509
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,040
So you know how you have

1510
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:16,040
two eyeballs?

1511
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:18,040
Yeah.

1512
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:20,040
I made sure

1513
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,040
you had two eyeballs because

1514
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:24,040
it's actually really startling

1515
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,040
if a vtuber only has

1516
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,040
one eye or is like a mono eye

1517
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,040
monster girl type thing.

1518
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:32,040
It's kind of one of the

1519
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,040
rules of like

1520
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,040
development is you can't

1521
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:38,040
wait can she see me under the table?

1522
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,040
You must have a girl

1523
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:42,040
with two eyes that isn't too freaky

1524
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,040
or you're putting them at a severe disadvantage.

1525
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,040
It kind of goes the same

1526
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,040
for vtubers that might have

1527
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,040
multiple eye designs.

1528
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,040
It's

1529
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:54,040
unfortunately just like

1530
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:56,040
a weird unwritten rule you're not supposed to do it.

1531
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,040
What is going on over here?

1532
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:00,040
Are we doing the dishes?

1533
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:02,040
Oh it's the balls!

1534
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,040
Oh it's the toy!

1535
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:06,040
Ah! Hide under table!

1536
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,040
Hide under table! Oh no there's no table over here!

1537
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,040
Leave us alone!

1538
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,040
Leave me alone I'm scared!

1539
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:14,040
I'm just a little guy

1540
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,040
who wants a knife!

1541
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:18,040
Hold on I want this knife.

1542
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,040
Hold on let me go on.

1543
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,040
Oh wow she's like chasing me all the way out.

1544
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,040
Chase me under the table good luck with that.

1545
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:28,040
You look very menacing with

1546
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,040
a knife in your mouth!

1547
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,040
Oh the knife is underneath you I think.

1548
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,040
What am I to do with a knife?

1549
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:38,040
I don't know I felt like maybe we can destroy

1550
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,040
the dartboard with the knife.

1551
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:42,040
Break the dartboard get the toy boat

1552
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:44,040
make the old man fall on his bottom

1553
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:46,040
steal a pint glass

1554
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:48,040
and drop it in a canal

1555
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:50,040
and set the table knife fork plate

1556
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,040
Oh.

1557
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:54,040
Set what table?

1558
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:56,040
I'm like proper stuck.

1559
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,040
Oh what's this?

1560
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,040
I'm currently getting gridlocked

1561
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,040
mildly gridlocked.

1562
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,040
Where are we supposed to set up a table?

1563
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,040
I don't know.

1564
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:08,040
Oh there's like a little underway pathway here.

1565
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,040
I mean a bug girl doesn't need

1566
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,040
multiple eyes.

1567
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:14,040
It's kind of hard to like

1568
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,040
Oh my god I'm like

1569
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:18,040
Sorry Mercy's currently fighting

1570
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,040
the owner and I'm like under here like

1571
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,040
Well actually when it comes to the designs

1572
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,040
and intricateness of having to produce

1573
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:26,040
Emma. Oh no don't shim me I was saying.

1574
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:28,040
You can't get me when I'm under

1575
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,040
the dock.

1576
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:36,040
Continue.

1577
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:38,040
What table

1578
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,040
are we supposed to set up?

1579
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,040
Wait we're meant to make him fall

1580
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,040
on his bottom. Oh when he goes

1581
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,040
to play the harmonic we need to move

1582
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,040
the chair out of the way.

1583
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,040
Oh that's sad.

1584
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,040
I don't know I know he seems a bit too old

1585
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,040
for this.

1586
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:56,040
Yeah he's literally already says oh my back hurts.

1587
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,040
How do we break

1588
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,040
a dart board truly?

1589
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,040
Maybe we take a knife and then

1590
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:04,040
he throws the knife instead.

1591
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,040
Is this one supposed to do it?

1592
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,040
No he notices as soon as

1593
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,040
I take it.

1594
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,040
Right so then what's the table we

1595
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:14,040
can you pick up the dart?

1596
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,040
You can.

1597
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,040
Bunk.

1598
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:24,040
Bunk.

1599
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,040
I don't

1600
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,040
I don't know.

1601
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:30,040
I wanted to play too sir.

1602
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:32,040
What the deal is

1603
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,040
reeflings you're going to have to

1604
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,040
hold my hand I don't know what we're

1605
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:38,040
doing.

1606
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,040
Oh no no no it's all good

1607
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,040
it's all good.

1608
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:44,040
Uh

1609
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,040
this is Scalera

1610
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,040
lens type thing.

1611
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,040
So when he goes to play the harmonica

1612
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,040
so basically we have to watch him play

1613
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:56,040
darts and then he grabs the harmonica.

1614
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:58,040
The table is in the back of the pub

1615
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,040
where Mercy got stuck at.

1616
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:02,040
We need to set a table whilst that person

1617
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:04,040
chases us around.

1618
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:06,040
That's severe.

1619
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,040
Biblically accurate

1620
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,040
Vita for Angel that's actually quite funny.

1621
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:14,040
Yeah

1622
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,040
well you you didn't get a bullseye

1623
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:18,040
but that's okay.

1624
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,040
Move out of the way.

1625
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,040
I wasn't doing anything.

1626
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:26,040
I wasn't doing anything.

1627
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,040
Yeah yeah.

1628
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,040
Oh

1629
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,040
I feel so bad now.

1630
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:38,040
Okay he actually recovered from

1631
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,040
Oh no he didn't.

1632
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,040
No we're sorry.

1633
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,040
I wasn't really

1634
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,040
at our attention but we got it done.

1635
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:48,040
Right we need to set a table

1636
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,040
up here.

1637
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,040
I'm setting a table.

1638
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:54,040
Table table table. What table?

1639
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,040
Table. This table?

1640
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:58,040
That table.

1641
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:00,040
The table that

1642
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,040
Mercy got stuck at.

1643
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,040
This one? Why yes.

1644
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,040
I am aware of a table Mercy got stuck

1645
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:08,040
at. This one? Surely.

1646
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,040
I don't

1647
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:12,040
I don't see any.

1648
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:14,040
The candlestick one.

1649
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,040
I've been able to pick up the candlestick though.

1650
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,040
You can't do that with this.

1651
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,040
I don't

1652
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,040
leave me alone. I'm just a little goose

1653
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,040
in a human world.

1654
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:30,040
Not there.

1655
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:32,040
It is back lift.

1656
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:36,040
Follow the path under the deck

1657
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,040
to get to the back.

1658
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,040
Wait

1659
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:42,040
where Mercy got taken and I couldn't reach?

1660
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,040
Oh

1661
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:46,040
Oh my god.

1662
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,040
Okay.

1663
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,040
Let's get these items.

1664
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,040
Let's get these items.

1665
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:54,040
You're chasing me out.

1666
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,040
Yes shoot shoot. We're out of the cafe.

1667
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:58,040
Go away and go do

1668
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,040
your cafe stuff.

1669
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,040
Exactly. I'm going to grab some stuff.

1670
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:04,040
I'm going to grab anything I can.

1671
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:06,040
I got the cup for the table.

1672
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:08,040
Are you going to grab something too?

1673
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:10,040
Are you feeling risky?

1674
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:12,040
Are you feeling risky?

1675
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:14,040
I'm going to get chased out.

1676
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,040
I broke it.

1677
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,040
Oopsies.

1678
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,040
Don't chase me out. I need to pick up an item

1679
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,040
for the table.

1680
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:24,040
That's right. I'm hiding under the table.

1681
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,040
I'm off camera.

1682
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:28,040
I'm out. Sorry.

1683
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:30,040
It's fine. Pick up that candle.

1684
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,040
You can pick up that candlestick I think.

1685
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:34,040
I want to get the candlestick

1686
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,040
but I'm stuck now.

1687
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,040
I'm stuck as well.

1688
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,040
This freaking video.

1689
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,040
The distance thing.

1690
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,040
Oh my god. I'm getting

1691
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:46,040
pushed out by the guard as well.

1692
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,040
Ring the guards.

1693
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:50,040
This is the best I can do. Literally be right under you.

1694
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:54,040
They did not make this game easy.

1695
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:56,040
We're two players.

1696
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,040
Sorry.

1697
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:00,040
Stop chasing me.

1698
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:02,040
How is he chasing you out like this?

1699
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,040
We're literally

1700
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:06,040
all the way inside the restaurant.

1701
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,040
Did the old man

1702
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,040
tell them?

1703
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,040
No. Stop looking at me.

1704
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:14,040
He is

1705
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:16,040
honing in on you. Can you come under the deck?

1706
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:18,040
I'm going to try to come under the deck.

1707
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,040
No.

1708
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,040
Okay. You're safe.

1709
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:24,040
He should go away. Yeah. He said,

1710
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:26,040
oh. Rassen for Rassen.

1711
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,040
And he's going to go get a beer.

1712
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:32,040
No.

1713
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:34,040
He instantly locks on you.

1714
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,040
How did he know?

1715
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,040
That doesn't seem right.

1716
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,040
That seems too difficult.

1717
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:42,040
Follow the...

1718
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:44,040
He's so persistent.

1719
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:46,040
Poor man can't catch a break.

1720
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,040
Wait. He's looking for his glass but I broke it.

1721
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:52,040
Wait. There's now two people in the cafe area.

1722
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,040
We need

1723
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,040
so much stuff from it.

1724
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:58,040
Hi.

1725
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,040
Does he give up?

1726
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:02,040
I hope he gives up. Damn.

1727
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,040
Yeah. Is there anything we can do on this side?

1728
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:06,040
I don't think so. I can see the goose sign

1729
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:08,040
here. They're going to move it right here.

1730
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:10,040
This sign right here. That's the no goose sign.

1731
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,040
I can tell. I have gamer instinct.

1732
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:14,040
There's a plate over here.

1733
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:16,040
Wait. There's already a plate here?

1734
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,040
There is.

1735
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,040
Okay. We'll take that and then

1736
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,040
we'll start getting it set up. Is there anything else

1737
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:24,040
I can grab? What's this?

1738
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:26,040
That's a bucket.

1739
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,040
Wait.

1740
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,040
I hope I don't break it.

1741
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:32,040
No. I don't... Yeah.

1742
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,040
Yeah.

1743
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,040
It's so painy.

1744
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,040
What?

1745
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,040
Oh, my face.

1746
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,040
My face! Ow!

1747
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,040
My little goose neck just got

1748
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,040
snapped in half. I can't believe he closed down

1749
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,040
your face.

1750
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:50,040
So red.

1751
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,040
So what is...

1752
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,040
We're like...

1753
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,040
How do you describe the dart bird?

1754
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,040
I am...

1755
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,040
Right. I'm going to get the salt shaker.

1756
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,040
Yeah. Get the salt shaker.

1757
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:04,040
Give me this. Give me this.

1758
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:06,040
Okay. I said give me this.

1759
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,040
There we go. Right. And then I'll go on to the table

1760
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:10,040
with you and then I'll go down the steps

1761
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,040
and then I can put it on the little table thing.

1762
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,040
And then that's one more. I am ticked off

1763
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,040
of this. Yeah. Jeez. She is

1764
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,040
feral for us right now.

1765
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:20,040
I'm following. I'm following.

1766
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,040
Is there emotion sickness levels

1767
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,040
question mark? Oh, bad.

1768
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:26,040
Because the camera keeps moving, but...

1769
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:28,040
Okay. Do we need to pause?

1770
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:30,040
We can always...

1771
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:32,040
I'm very sad.

1772
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,040
I think we've had a good game insertion.

1773
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,040
We do not actually have to... Yeah, I don't want you

1774
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,040
to actually be sick

1775
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,040
by this game.

1776
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,040
If it's too much, please don't be afraid to say no

1777
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,040
because I can literally mean and chat

1778
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:46,040
and ask questions and stuff.

1779
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,040
I'm trying. I'm trying to

1780
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,040
get through it.

1781
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,040
Okay. How about we finish this

1782
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:54,040
goofy level and then maybe call it

1783
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,040
there because I don't want you to be sick.

1784
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:58,040
Yeah. Is she going to be bothered?

1785
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,040
Yeah. Okay. Well, great.

1786
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,040
Right. Let's just check the list to make sure

1787
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,040
we need to steal

1788
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:06,040
a glass paint

1789
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:08,040
and drop it in the canal. I don't even know

1790
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:10,040
where that is. We just need a knife, a fork,

1791
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:12,040
and a candle. Okay.

1792
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:14,040
Don't worry. There's a candle there.

1793
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,040
Okay.

1794
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,040
Oh, she's right there again.

1795
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:20,040
Oh, that camera angle.

1796
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:22,040
She doesn't bother with us. Does she?

1797
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:24,040
No, she's just happy.

1798
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,040
She's like, what a curiosity.

1799
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,040
You're breaking up my day.

1800
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,040
Thank you, little geese for showing up.

1801
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,040
I was like, oh, you're welcome. Right. Where is this

1802
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,040
fork?

1803
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,040
Sugar.

1804
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:38,040
She's going to see me.

1805
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:40,040
No, no, no, no, no. You don't see me.

1806
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,040
I am a mystery.

1807
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,040
Oh, metal bones.

1808
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,040
No, no, don't push me that way.

1809
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:48,040
Mercy's that way.

1810
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:50,040
I'm getting pushed out.

1811
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,040
I'm literally getting pushed out of the camera.

1812
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:54,040
I can't bring you closer to the stairs.

1813
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:56,040
That's okay.

1814
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,040
I'm trying to grab the knife.

1815
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:00,040
Game devs, you really

1816
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,040
have done yourself with this one.

1817
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,040
I think I'm getting shoved.

1818
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:06,040
I know you're stuck.

1819
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:08,040
I am complete. I can't even see myself.

1820
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,040
Hold on. Hold on.

1821
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:12,040
Hold on. Here we go.

1822
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:14,040
Wait, hold on.

1823
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,040
I need to snipe his shoes, basically.

1824
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,040
Okay.

1825
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:24,040
This isn't...

1826
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:26,040
Development team.

1827
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,040
You need a hand?

1828
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:30,040
Yes. Go, tie your lace

1829
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,040
as it's dangerous to go.

1830
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:34,040
Wait, I can't even get past?

1831
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:36,040
Bro, you ain't even got...

1832
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,040
The whole mechanic was that he...

1833
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,040
You take your shoes off.

1834
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,040
I'm being trolled so hard this game.

1835
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:44,040
Hold on. Let me just move underneath.

1836
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,040
No, never mind. I'm out of bounds now.

1837
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:48,040
Yeah, it keeps...

1838
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,040
I can't even get past. Okay, there we go.

1839
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,040
Oh, we did it. We did it. We did it.

1840
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:54,040
Go, go, go.

1841
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,040
No, no, no, don't send me out again.

1842
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,040
Don't send me out of bounds again.

1843
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:02,040
Oh, it doesn't matter because he's chasing you.

1844
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:04,040
No, I want my knife.

1845
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,040
Well, one of us can...

1846
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:08,040
I've taken the knife.

1847
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:10,040
The knife.

1848
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:12,040
Oh, no, no, he's got you.

1849
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:14,040
Well, sorry, I'm running.

1850
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:18,040
Pick up the knife, please.

1851
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:20,040
Okay, there we go. I got it. I got it. I got the knife.

1852
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,040
Run.

1853
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:24,040
Run.

1854
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:26,040
Okay, we did it.

1855
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,040
My controls are not nice.

1856
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:30,040
Help!

1857
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:32,040
Help!

1858
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,040
I can't even see you.

1859
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:36,040
I can't even see me!

1860
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,040
Wait, the guy doesn't respond

1861
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:42,040
to honking at all?

1862
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:44,040
He doesn't care!

1863
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:46,040
No!

1864
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,040
Oh, he sucks.

1865
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:50,040
I don't like him.

1866
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,040
Oh, no, I have made a grave error.

1867
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,040
Go, I need to go underneath

1868
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:56,040
or above either one.

1869
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:58,040
No, I'm getting pushed out.

1870
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:00,040
He's such a bully.

1871
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,040
Oh, well, I can just sneak over.

1872
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,040
Can you maybe run, please?

1873
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:06,040
Nice lady.

1874
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:08,040
I can't hear until he stops being aggressive on us.

1875
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,040
He is like the worst.

1876
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:12,040
Yeah, darn it.

1877
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:14,040
He's not having any of it.

1878
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:16,040
No, no, wait, he shouldn't know where it is.

1879
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:18,040
I left it on the other side of the fence

1880
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:20,040
at the table

1881
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,040
that we set up so it should be fine.

1882
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:24,040
Our knife is...

1883
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:26,040
Yeah, go away, mister.

1884
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,040
Go, go away, mister.

1885
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:32,040
Literally, he's so aggressive against us.

1886
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,040
This is discrimination.

1887
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:36,040
I'll be talking to the BBC.

1888
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:38,040
Exactly.

1889
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,040
I'll be doing a report.

1890
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:42,040
I'll be getting interviewers out here

1891
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,040
so everyone can learn of your dastardly...

1892
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,040
Right.

1893
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:48,040
Hide under the table.

1894
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,040
What's this?

1895
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,040
What is it?

1896
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,040
I don't know, but...

1897
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:00,040
I'm pulling.

1898
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:02,040
Oh my god, it's how I get a beer.

1899
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:04,040
Wait, but I don't have a glass.

1900
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:06,040
Sugar.

1901
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:08,040
Well, I've got a fork.

1902
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:10,040
We need to fork anyway.

1903
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:12,040
Let me get out of here with this fork.

1904
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:14,040
I don't know where the glass of beer is, though.

1905
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,040
I'm underneath, so she can't get me.

1906
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:20,040
I think we broke it.

1907
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:22,040
We did.

1908
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,040
So how on earth did we get...

1909
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:26,040
Well, I did.

1910
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,040
Um...

1911
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,040
Ah, I knocked it over.

1912
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,040
No, no, it's okay. I think it still counts.

1913
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,040
As long as it's on the table, I think it counts.

1914
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:36,040
Wow, I'm doing a little 360.

1915
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,040
All right, it says...

1916
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:44,040
A knife and a candle. We actually do have a knife.

1917
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:46,040
Oh. Right, we just need a candle.

1918
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,040
We've done this really awkward part.

1919
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:50,040
Why won't it stand?

1920
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:54,040
Okay, let's do this approach.

1921
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,040
There we go.

1922
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:58,040
Or do we have to, like, actually set it...

1923
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:00,040
Like, the fork goes on the left.

1924
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:02,040
The knife goes on the right type stuff.

1925
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:04,040
Nah, they wouldn't put that in the game.

1926
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:06,040
They wouldn't put that, right?

1927
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,040
I feel like that's, like...

1928
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:10,040
How do you know your knowledge?

1929
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,040
Well, I cannot pick up the fork.

1930
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:14,040
Is it glitched out?

1931
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:16,040
It says the fork is there. Okay.

1932
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:18,040
It still counts. We've got to get the candle now.

1933
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,040
This is the candle.

1934
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,040
And then we're done this terrible back and forth section, I think.

1935
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:26,040
Where was the... Hello.

1936
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:28,040
Hi. Oh, sorry.

1937
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,040
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be in your way.

1938
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:34,040
Wait, she's pushing me out of the way.

1939
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:36,040
Stinky.

1940
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,040
You want to give me all the attention, lady, don't you?

1941
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:44,040
Yes, you do.

1942
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:46,040
Where did she put the candle?

1943
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:52,040
Is that the best paper again?

1944
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:54,040
It may be.

1945
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:58,040
I'm just a goose getting all the attention.

1946
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:00,040
For no... Oh, I'm stuck on her.

1947
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:02,040
For no particular...

1948
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,040
I'll go under the deck.

1949
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:08,040
Yes.

1950
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,040
Oh, sugar. Okay.

1951
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:12,040
You got it.

1952
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:14,040
I don't know where she...

1953
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,040
Oh, my game. My game just closed.

1954
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:18,040
Whoa! However, I think you're going to have to come

1955
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:20,040
down these stairs and then come underneath with me here.

1956
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:22,040
If I don't get chased out, yes.

1957
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:24,040
Yeah, come this way, this way.

1958
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,040
No, no, no, no!

1959
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,040
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1960
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:30,040
Send it, send it, send it!

1961
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,040
Okay, okay, I think it's okay.

1962
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:34,040
I think it's okay.

1963
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:36,040
I've got the candlestick.

1964
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:38,040
Oh, no.

1965
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,040
That's the main thing. As long as we got the candlestick,

1966
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,040
I can get you back in.

1967
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:44,040
All you have to do is unpeel as we...

1968
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:46,040
Yeah, you're not coming under here.

1969
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:48,040
Oh, wait, why did I hit her?

1970
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:50,040
Uh, you might be able to get past...

1971
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,040
Yeah, you can get back in

1972
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:54,040
if I distract him enough.

1973
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:56,040
And then come under here with me.

1974
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:58,040
No!

1975
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:00,040
This guy sucks!

1976
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:02,040
Oh!

1977
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:04,040
It controls, it controls.

1978
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,040
Okay, we're safe, we're safe.

1979
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:08,040
The heat is now off of us.

1980
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,040
Oh, you can see my little red flippers.

1981
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,040
I like my little flip-flops.

1982
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:14,040
Okay, he has gone back.

1983
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:16,040
I think we can now go to the wee restaurant.

1984
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:18,040
The wee restaurant.

1985
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:20,040
I'm stuck on something.

1986
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,040
We casually scroll in.

1987
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,040
You're stuck?

1988
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:26,040
I'm like getting stuck on stuff.

1989
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:28,040
There we go.

1990
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:30,040
I don't know.

1991
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:32,040
Okay, there we go.

1992
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:34,040
Wee!

1993
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,040
We finally frickin' did it!

1994
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:38,040
This one was not easy.

1995
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,040
I think it's the control and the camera.

1996
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,040
Yeah, this camera angle

1997
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:44,040
is spinning around every two seconds.

1998
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:46,040
Oh, I'm stuck again.

1999
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:48,040
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

2000
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:50,040
Is that vomit burp?

2001
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,040
I'm getting nervous.

2002
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:54,040
It was the motion sickness burp.

2003
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:56,040
I'm so sorry, excuse me.

2004
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,040
Actually, we can stop.

2005
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:00,040
I didn't know when you just hop on our first collab.

2006
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:02,040
Because we picked up this motion.

2007
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,040
Okay, if that was a vomit burp,

2008
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:06,040
I'm happy to say we have set the table.

2009
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:08,040
Yeah, we set the table.

2010
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,040
Okay, I am not going to make you play anymore.

2011
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:12,040
I really do not.

2012
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:14,040
Any issues?

2013
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:16,040
Okay.

2014
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,040
We will say thank you so so much

2015
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:20,040
for letting us have

2016
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:22,040
an absolute carry on.

2017
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:24,040
Unfortunately, we thank you.

2018
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:26,040
I stupendously

2019
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:28,040
asked her to

2020
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:30,040
play a motion sickness

2021
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:32,040
and juicing game. I had no idea

2022
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:34,040
that the camera angle was so violent

2023
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,040
towards her, per mercy.

2024
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:38,040
But I think

2025
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,040
I'm happy to say we'll end it there.

2026
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:42,040
I don't want any vomit.

2027
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,040
Okay, that's the bottom line.

2028
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:46,040
Okay, that's the bottom line.

2029
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,040
No vomit please.

2030
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:50,040
I'm sorry.

2031
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:52,040
No, don't be sorry.

2032
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:54,040
I was like, oh, it was so good.

2033
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:56,040
I haven't burped yet on stream.

2034
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:58,040
Oops.

2035
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,040
We'll play it safe.

2036
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:02,040
Please do not worry. Let's play nice and safe.

2037
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:04,040
We will say to the snippets

2038
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:06,040
and the reeflings. Thank you so so much

2039
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:08,040
for watching.

2040
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:10,040
I am streaming again tomorrow.

2041
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:12,040
Merci. Are you streaming tomorrow?

2042
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:14,040
Is the real question?

2043
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,040
No, I place my day off.

2044
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:18,040
Well, I'll put her to work

2045
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:20,040
lads. Don't you worry.

2046
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:22,040
I'll make an ASMR for her to put her to work.

2047
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:24,040
Don't you worry about that.

2048
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:26,040
Teasing. Teasing.

2049
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:28,040
She'll have a break.

2050
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:30,040
We will leave it there

2051
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:32,040
and I'm going to let you know

2052
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:34,040
that we're going to be playing

2053
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:36,040
a motion sickness game.

2054
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:38,040
We'll leave it there

2055
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,040
and I'm going to let Merci lie down

2056
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:42,040
because I think she needs a good nap

2057
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:44,040
or maybe a big lie down

2058
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:46,040
and some fizzy juice to help her feel a bit better.

2059
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:48,040
But thank you so so much

2060
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:50,040
for joining me, Merci. I appreciate that so much.

2061
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:52,040
And that was actually genuinely really fun.

2062
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:54,040
So much fun.

2063
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:56,040
As chaotic as that game was,

2064
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:58,040
that was actually hilarious that you

2065
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:00,040
started controlling my goose.

2066
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:02,040
Wow, yandere powers.

2067
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:04,040
Literally.

2068
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:06,040
That was supposed to be that most of this one here.

2069
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:08,040
Right. Thank you so so much.

2070
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:10,040
Thank you everyone.

2071
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,040
I'm going to end a little strum.

2072
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:14,040
Oh wait, no, no one's streaming

2073
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:16,040
because you're the one that normally streams lads.

2074
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:18,040
Should I?

2075
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:20,040
Let's see if there's someone on you.

2076
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:22,040
Let me check with one of the girls.

2077
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:24,040
Let me check if I can find it.

2078
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:26,040
Azura rated it in a U.S.

2079
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:28,040
That means she finished her cheeky stream,

2080
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:30,040
her cheeky bricky stream.

2081
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:32,040
There are some girls

2082
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:34,040
on. There's Rain

2083
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:36,040
from Ume Plus

2084
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:38,040
and a bunch of

2085
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:40,040
VNU girls are on too.

2086
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:42,040
I have not

2087
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:48,040
I will do Rae from

2088
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:50,040
Thingy because I don't think she's monetized yet.

2089
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,040
She will watch Time.

2090
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:54,040
Yeah, let's Rae into Rain.

2091
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:56,040
I will Rae into Rae. She's doing

2092
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:58,040
unicorn overload, number two,

2093
02:05:58,040 --> 02:06:00,040
shipping characters to fight better.

2094
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:02,040
This one's like a

2095
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:04,040
vanilla wear game.

2096
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:06,040
It's supposed to be really good.

2097
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:08,040
Have you played it before?

2098
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:10,040
No, I haven't.

2099
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:12,040
But I'm a fan of vanilla wear

2100
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:14,040
games.

2101
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:16,040
That's cute.

2102
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:18,040
Thank you so much, Sneeflings.

2103
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:20,040
Thank you so much, Mersey, for joining me.

2104
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:22,040
Please do get some serious rest

2105
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:24,040
because I do not want any.

2106
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:26,040
How terrible is that headline?

2107
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:28,040
Collab

2108
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:30,040
results in like vomit.

2109
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,040
What kind of collab is going on

2110
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:34,040
if that's the case?

2111
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:36,040
Thank you.

2112
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:38,040
I missed some soupas.

2113
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:40,040
Thank you so much.

2114
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,040
Misaka best for the

2115
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:44,040
420 blazes.

2116
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:46,040
Stop goose hate. Thank you so much

2117
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:48,040
for the tip you with me.

2118
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:50,040
Thank you.

2119
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:54,040
For the five dollar

2120
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:56,040
super chat. Did you know Rick

2121
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:58,040
Ashley is never going to give you up.

2122
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:00,040
Never going to let you down.

2123
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:02,040
Never going to let you down

2124
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:04,040
twice. Never going to run around

2125
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:06,040
and desert you. Yes, I knew that.

2126
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:08,040
Thank you so much for the five.

2127
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:10,040
Wow.

2128
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:12,040
Thank you so much, everyone

2129
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:14,040
for such a wonderful stream

2130
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,040
and thank you.

2131
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:18,040
It was unexpected that

2132
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:20,040
we hit such a

2133
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,040
dizzy game.

2134
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:24,040
We got so close though,

2135
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:26,040
but I would not have picked that game

2136
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:28,040
had I known how spinny camera it was.

2137
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:30,040
I thought it was

2138
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:32,040
a straightforward linear

2139
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,040
experience. So I do apologize for that

2140
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:36,040
oversight, Mercy. It's okay.

2141
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,040
Honestly, everything looked

2142
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:40,040
like it was going to be fine, but like

2143
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:42,040
yeah, that was

2144
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:44,040
every time we entered or moved around

2145
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:46,040
somewhere, the camera just like violently

2146
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:48,040
spins over.

2147
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:50,040
Sorry to anyone that also has

2148
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:52,040
motion sickness watching. You probably feel like

2149
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:54,040
right now.

2150
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:58,040
Okay.

2151
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:00,040
Right.

2152
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:02,040
I will let you get going.

2153
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:04,040
Thank you so much, Mercy.

2154
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:06,040
Let's put it to the end stream

2155
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:08,040
and then we're right into rain.

2156
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:10,040
Yeah. Yes.

2157
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:12,040
Okay, I'm end streamed. Bye bye, replays.

2158
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:14,040
Bye bye.

2159
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:20,040
In the broadcast.

2160
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:24,040
Successfully.
