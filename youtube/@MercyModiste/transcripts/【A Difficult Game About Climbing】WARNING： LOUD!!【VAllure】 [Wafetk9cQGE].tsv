1524500	1525500	Okay.
1525500	1526500	Okay.
1526500	1527500	Good.
1529500	1530500	Ehhh...
1531500	1532500	allergen?
1534500	1535500	Oh.
1538500	1539500	Okay.
1550500	1551500	Okay.
1551500	1558500	It seems too high.
1558500	1568260	Yeah, you know what, we're not gonna do it, we're not gonna risk it, uh-oh, we're not
1568260	1578820	gonna risk that, nope, nope, I'm wondering, instead of going in and around, I can somehow
1578820	1583820	just get over there.
1583820	1588820	Probably not.
1588820	1593820	Boogie.
1593820	1600820	That's it, what's on the other side?
1600820	1605820	What's on the other side?
1605820	1610820	Let's just check it out.
1610820	1618820	Let's just check out what's on the other side.
1618820	1622820	Literally nothing.
1622820	1638820	The way he swam was so funny though.
1638820	1644820	Okay, come on.
1644820	1657820	And nothing, okay.
1657820	1658820	What?
1658820	1662820	He swam straight down?
1662820	1669820	No.
1669820	1672820	No.
1672820	1673820	Can he drown?
1673820	1684820	No, but I booted up the game a little bit earlier and he can drift away.
1684820	1693820	Did you know he can drift away in the water?
1693820	1717820	He can drift away in the water, what the heck, right?
1717820	1746820	That was my mistake, by the way.
1746820	1747820	Stay.
1747820	1748820	Yeah.
1748820	1753820	Yeah, you got it.
1753820	1770820	Yeah, you got it.
1770820	1775820	Yeah, we got this.
1775820	1777820	Yeah.
1777820	1779820	Yeah.
1779820	1781820	Yeah.
1781820	1782820	What?
1782820	1797820	Stay, stay, stay.
1797820	1825820	I trust you.
1825820	1830820	I trust you, Mr. Bald Naked Man, sir.
1830820	1833820	I trust you.
1833820	1837820	Please don't, don't break this trust.
1837820	1839820	Yeah.
1839820	1865820	This bald man has a name.
1865820	1870820	Apparently his diogenes, apparently.
1870820	1883820	But I know that man doesn't shave, so.
1883820	1889820	Ooh, that was kind of dangerous.
1889820	1894820	Stay, stay, stay, stay.
1894820	1916820	Oh, what, okay.
1916820	1918820	How many pull-ups can you do, Marcy?
1918820	1930820	Zero.
1930820	1938820	Are you sure it's supposed to be this way, Senpai?
1938820	1947820	It's kind of dangerous.
1947820	1973820	Oh, that's where it falls, too.
1973820	1989820	Good to know.
1989820	2014820	Use your, your, your yowly hands.
2014820	2021820	Ow.
2021820	2024820	Yowly hands usually slip rate.
2024820	2031820	Yeah, with that amount of lube they use.
2031820	2041820	Yeah.
2041820	2051820	Yep.
2051820	2067820	I can't get in the tub, Senpai.
2067820	2070820	I have no water today.
2070820	2077820	Apparently the water's going to turn on tomorrow, maybe.
2077820	2087820	I forgot to grip.
2087820	2097820	Maybe, I don't know, like, there could be lots of things that happen, right?
2097820	2109820	Yeah.
2109820	2114820	I don't know why I decided to climb on this thing when it's literally so easy to reach this.
2114820	2116820	I was so stupid.
2116820	2120820	I was so stupid.
2120820	2122820	What happened to your water?
2122820	2127820	Some emergency water line thing.
2127820	2147820	Water thing, so they're like, okay, we got to, like, check for, like, stuff, and I was like, okay.
2147820	2151820	No shower, like, no water at all, so I'm like, okay.
2151820	2170820	I've got, like, a ton of water because Papa has just a habit of boiling water and putting them into, like, bottles, so we just have lots.
2170820	2173820	Interesting, so when was the last time you showered?
2173820	2198820	Some questions are left to the imagination, yeah?
2198820	2201820	Did you want the truth?
2201820	2203820	Did you want the truth?
2203820	2208820	Some plays?
2208820	2212820	You wanted the truth?
2212820	2217820	I haven't showered since debut.
2217820	2220820	I haven't showered since debut.
2220820	2232820	Here.
2232820	2246820	Today was my shower day, and then, well, turns out I'm destined to be stinky today.
2246820	2263820	I haven't showered for debut because I was like, okay, I'm really stressed, so I'm going to shower for debut, and then I've been preparing a lot of stuff for Senpai, so I haven't had time.
2263820	2271820	And today I was like, oh, well, I don't have a lot of stuff to prepare today, so I'm just going to have a shower today.
2271820	2280820	The water, the electrician gas and water place was like, blur away your water!
2280820	2287820	And I was like, oh, great.
2287820	2294820	Oh, come on.
2294820	2300820	Why am I so bad at this suddenly?
2301820	2306820	Thank you for the tip!
2306820	2308820	Thank you for the...
2308820	2323820	I can't read how much that was. Thank you for the tip, Mr. Tony.
2323820	2327820	I don't think I smell too badly.
2327820	2334820	Maybe today I do.
2334820	2355820	Why is this area so much harder than it was like three minutes ago?
2355820	2362820	Like, I don't think... Okay, okay. Senpai, you're always like, oh, you're so stinky, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2362820	2373820	But Senpai...
2373820	2376820	I don't sweat that much.
2376820	2382820	Not that much. I do sweat, but like, I don't sweat that much.
2382820	2393820	Oh, come on.
2393820	2411820	That's what they all say! Who's all? Who's they? Who's they? What the fuck? Senpai, who is they?
2411820	2423820	Who the fuck is they?
2423820	2442820	Mars! Cut off his testicles!
2453820	2463820	I can't believe my Senpais would cheat on me like this.
2463820	2473820	I can't believe it. The entire time. I've done this for all of you guys. Look at me. I'm struggling. I'm struggling in this game.
2473820	2484820	For you, Senpai! And then what's the thing I get? Your dirty fucking cheating ass hole!
2484820	2493820	I don't smell.
2493820	2499820	Okay. I don't smell that much.
2499820	2515820	In fact, science says that it should be, you know, with the person you love, the sweat smells like pheromones, so it should smell like flowers.
2515820	2523820	Okay.
2523820	2529820	I'm so mad! I got distracted. I got so angry.
2529820	2540820	Oh, are you sweating? A little bit.
2540820	2557820	I got distracted and angry. I was mad and angry and mad and pissed!
2557820	2573820	Anyways, I don't sweat. So, see, sweat that much. So, only once in a while does my pits stink, and you're going to be so shocked about this Senpai.
2573820	2586820	For some reason, my feet don't sweat, and I don't know why.
2586820	2599820	Are they okay? I don't know. Maybe it's just naturally dry.
2599820	2607820	Here is the areas that I do sweat a little bit more than usual.
2607820	2618820	I sweat more around my neck.
2618820	2634820	And I sweat more around my lower back.
2634820	2647820	But yeah, it's mostly my neck.
2647820	2656820	Like the back of my neck gets really sweaty.
2656820	2665820	My pits can get sweaty.
2665820	2676820	And, oh yeah, it's mostly my neck. I always have to apply deodorant there.
2686820	2697820	Your hair long or short?
2697820	2715820	Senpai, do you have eyes? It's long.
2715820	2744820	Like you seem bad to me. Are we looking at the same characters? I'm right here Senpai! You know what the scissors in the hair? Hello? Did you forget what I looked like? Are you cheating? Are you such a cheating cheater that you forgot what I looked like?
2744820	2766820	I don't know what I looked like.
2766820	2779820	I was hoping I could get that to work.
2779820	2808820	I was going to say something bad, but I remember that YouTube will hate bad words.
2808820	2834820	Are you going to say the C word? No! I was going to say the S word.
2834820	2859820	Yeah, new tech. New tech found.
2859820	2881820	Oh, Azura! Thank you for the raid! Azura! Azura! Azura!
2881820	2890820	Okay, I saw Senpai say I should be more up here. That I have bigger swing, right?
2890820	2900820	Welcome Raiders! Welcome to the stream! We are playing a very difficult game, a climbing game.
2900820	2911820	You'll hear lots of screams from me.
2911820	2940820	I don't know Senpai, this seems a little far. Are you sure this is where I should be? Like here, maybe here? This looks safer.
2942820	2955820	I don't know. Okay, maybe I should be up more.
2955820	2967820	Are you here? Okay.
2986820	3005820	Azura, you're going to cramp your hand! Don't do this!
3005820	3015820	Oh, come on. Fine, just use- there you go.
3015820	3034820	Efficiency. I take it back.
3034820	3054820	I take it back when I said.
3054820	3074820	Oh, man, I'm so not a gamer. You know, at the beginning of the game, where I was like, yeah, I'm gaming. I'm gaming, bros. I'm gaming Senpai. That was a lie.
3074820	3094820	Okay, I was in denial of my true strength. You know, I thought I had the ability, but turns out my ability that I had was a lie and that I was strongly overcompensating for my skills.
3094820	3101820	I thought I was a gamer. I thought I was. You know what? I lied. I lied. I'm not a gamer at all. You guys can't punish me for this.
3101820	3110820	My Senpais can't punish me for not being able to game, okay? Look at me. Look at me. This is because my hands are sweaty. Yeah, it's totally because my hands are sweaty.
3110820	3138820	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3138820	3160820	So does his legs not work now? This man's leg just doesn't work. All we can do is rely on these arms that seem to have the power of, of like a thousand who's like, who's able to hold on for, for dear life for such a long time.
3161820	3163820	Yeah.
3164820	3166820	Yeah.
3177820	3179820	Ah.
3179820	3181820	Ah.
3186820	3188820	Just grab on, man.
3191820	3193820	Well, yeah. Hiya.
3204820	3208820	Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya.
3210820	3212820	esperar
3216820	3218820	Yeah.
3220820	3222820	Meow.
3223820	3227820	Hi. Hi.
3239820	3265820	No, I want to be higher, right?
3265820	3283820	Maybe a bit higher?
3283820	3291820	Oh, maybe I should be more to the edge.
3291820	3309820	Oh, he slips.
3309820	3324820	I forgot he slips.
3324820	3349820	I got spooked.
3349820	3365820	Stop counting my falls!
3365820	3390820	I don't need to know the amount of times I fail. I just need to know the amount of times I win.
3390820	3413820	I know this is the beginning.
3413820	3437820	Stop bullying me!
3437820	3439820	Got it.
3467820	3495820	There we go.
3495820	3517820	There we go.
3517820	3533820	It's fun! Slippery! Slippery!
3534820	3539820	Hmm.
3539820	3551820	Hmm.
3551820	3572820	Yeah!
3572820	3596820	This man just goes, brrr, cold.
3596820	3625820	Oh, brrr.
3625820	3654820	Oh, brrr.
3654820	3679820	Oh, brrr.
3679820	3708820	This is a mean game. This is a rain game. I know it's a rain game. My man does not feel that great.
3708820	3719820	A hard but not impossible game is what they said. And I wanted to show off to Senpai that I could probably do it.
3719820	3731820	Right now I'm starting to question my life choices.
3731820	3755820	Senpai's must be better gamers than me.
3755820	3775820	Shut up, Amy!
3775820	3793820	Easy. Easy your way.
3793820	3804820	I don't like that area. That area sucks. You know what? That sucks. That sucks balls. Okay?
3804820	3833820	I can't believe I fell at that part.
3833820	3862820	Eh, eh, wah, wah, wah. Fuck you. Fuck this bullshit.
3862820	3869820	No.
3893820	3909820	Hmm.
3909820	3931820	Hmm. Focus. Laser focus.
3931820	3952820	Laser focus.
3952820	3964820	Hmm.
3964820	3981820	Maybe I need my hand like here.
3981820	4003820	Nyeh.
4003820	4032820	Nyeh.
4032820	4059820	Nyeh.
4059820	4084820	Nyeh.
4084820	4099820	Nyeh.
4099820	4128820	Nyeh.
4129820	4146820	Nyeh.
4146820	4168820	Nyeh.
4168820	4188820	Nyeh.
4188820	4203820	Nyeh.
4203820	4219820	Shut up. Shut up Senpai.
4219820	4244820	Okay, one handed gameplay.
4244820	4266820	And a drink tea.
4266820	4295820	What do you think it is? By the way, it's an apple cinnamon. Apple cinnamon tea.
4295820	4314820	Oh yeah.
4314820	4324820	Maybe I should have been here.
4324820	4331820	Just need to be brave.
4331820	4333820	I'm not brave.
4333820	4356820	Give me a second.
4356820	4382820	Nyeh.
4382820	4399820	Nyeh.
4399820	4428820	Senpai, you're not tired of me, right? You still love me, right? Even though I'm a bad gamer?
4428820	4438820	Nyeh.
4438820	4462820	Nyeh.
4462820	4476820	I don't even know how physics work.
4476820	4486820	There's some games I'm good at you. I bet.
4486820	4497820	Like rock, paper, scissors maybe?
4497820	4510820	Visual novels are like, it's gameplay but it's not like gameplay, you know?
4510820	4530820	I can guess I'm okay at detective games and puzzle games, sort of.
4530820	4550820	Nyeh.
4550820	4579820	Seriously, can I get these arms? How does this man not just buff in the arms?
4579820	4607820	Nessie. Oh yeah.
4607820	4625820	Was it here? Or did I need to go down here? I can't remember.
4625820	4652820	Nyeh.
4652820	4668820	Hold on, I need to position this. That didn't count as a fall, I caught my way down.
4668820	4688820	Okay, maybe that one did.
4688820	4714820	Senpai, this hurts my hand too much. I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.
4714820	4735820	Because this hurts my hand a lot. I don't know if it's gonna work.
4735820	4762820	This is kind of harder.
4762820	4791820	This is less precise.
4791820	4810820	Just that my hand really hurt with the mouse. That's a little hard. I'll see what we can do.
4810820	4835820	He's dangling. This is harder.
4835820	4843820	It doesn't hurt my hand as much. This is gonna be a new learning curve.
4865820	4888820	A new learning curve, but it doesn't hurt my hand as much. Thank you for the dollar you do a day in white.
4888820	4900820	Oh gosh, this is so hard to control for the controller. I know it's technically easier on mouse, but...
4900820	4923820	Mercy's hand's hurt.
4930820	4959820	I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.
4960820	4989820	This is so hard to control the hands. Look how much more flingy he is.
4990820	4994820	Oh no!
5020820	5049820	I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.
5050820	5079820	I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.
5080820	5109820	No, no, no, I have no idea.
5110820	5139820	I don't know if I should play with a controller or not.
5140820	5155820	Learning the controller is so hard.
5156820	5173820	At least less hand pain, yeah. Oh my goodness.
5173820	5184820	Such a learning curve. I should definitely invest in a smaller mouse. What the heck? Why did I buy such a big, enormous thing?
5203820	5232820	I don't know why I did that. What mouse? It's a HyperX. I bought it because it was pink. It actually kind of sucks, because it always disconnects.
5234820	5255820	Oh, come on.
5255820	5260820	Oh no!
5285820	5304820	Oh, it's not a wireless mouse. The mouse I got is a wired mouse. It disconnects all the time and I always have to go to the back of the PC and grab it because it sucks.
5315820	5344820	Oh, come on.
5345820	5354820	This man swings too much.
5375820	5404820	Let's try this part with the mouse instead.
5405820	5428820	Oh, come on.
5435820	5444820	Maybe try a different USB port. All my USB ports are taken, so there's only one place left for it.
5444820	5463820	When I had my other mouse... I'm going back to mouse style. I'm sorry. It was just too hard.
5463820	5474820	When I had my other mouse, it worked just fine. Same ports, everything. It's just this HyperX1 freaking sucks.
5493820	5508820	Oh, come on.
5508820	5529820	Oh, come on.
5529820	5540820	Thank you for the 420 King Chucky.
5540820	5551820	This is my Zatsu. Sorry, I'm just like super focused. Hyper, hyper, hyper focused.
5570820	5599820	I'm going back to the mouse. It hurts me, but I can control it better.
5599820	5615820	That's it. I'm going to put a new mouse on my list. I was like, yeah, I wanted to be pink. I wanted it to be pink and cute and adorable so it can match all the rest of my stuff.
5615820	5634820	Oh, it sucks. Oh, whatever. I feel like...
5645820	5672820	Can I grab with Q? Like this? I guess this works.
5672820	5701820	Okay, well, this works. I just have to remember which key is which.
5702820	5729820	I have to claw it. So that's good. Thank you.
5729820	5758820	Okay.
5760820	5783820	Why is this getting harder? Maybe it's because I'm getting more frustrated.
5783820	5799820	My favorite color is purple. I'm trying to get stuff to match purple and white, right? I guess aesthetics is important, in my opinion. I feel like if things around me are the colors that make me happy and I can be happy.
5799820	5807820	That's why I have all my dog cages to be super cute and pink and adorable. I painted them all cute colors.
5829820	5840820	Maybe here?
5859820	5875820	Are you not allowed to customize? You know how I said I like color coordination senpai? I like all my things to be color coordinated. Understood?
5889820	5917820	Yeah.
5917820	5929820	Just got to deal with the carpal tunnel.
5929820	5939820	Bitch.
5959820	5969820	Yeah.
5989820	5999820	Senpai, this part is hard. And this is the beginning.
6019820	6039820	I want to be a gamer, but I suck at gaming.
6040820	6050820	Son of a slut!
6050820	6066820	I'm sorry for using bad words.
6066820	6086820	Don't worry.
6086820	6096820	Don't worry. I soundproofed everything. So, senpai. The neighbors won't normally hear me. Normally.
6116820	6144820	I don't mind a little back seating, but I really don't know where to go how to get to this part.
6144820	6166820	Do I swing here?
6166820	6176820	Do I swing with both arms? Like this? This?
6197820	6216820	Hmm. Kind of scary.
6216820	6226820	Do-do-do.
6246820	6271820	I don't know.
6271820	6291820	You slipped down more. Maybe I'm just stupid?
6301820	6330820	Instead of flipping, you mean like, hold on. Maybe you're on to something, senpai.
6330820	6340820	No, no, no, no!
6360820	6380820	I'm not a gamer. That's it. I relinquish that title for someone more worthy of such a title.
6410820	6426820	I'm not a gamer.
6426820	6436820	Yep.
6436820	6465820	Okay.
6465820	6487820	Now do the same as before, but let go slightly early so your body won't flip.
6487820	6513820	Why does everyone get stuck at the same part every time? Well, maybe that part is hard, senpai.
6513820	6525820	At this point, I'm not even watching it anymore. I'm just like, okay, well, this time I've already got a pattern sort of how to like do this.
6525820	6536820	Just this one part. One part. It gets harder. I know. But this one part, I just want to get past it. I just want to get past this one part.
6555820	6568820	It's deft doable, but like maybe I just don't know the trick to it, you know?
6586820	6605820	We never lose, we never give up. This is what... This is what persistence is. Oh, shit. Ah, fuck.
6605820	6625820	Tenacity, persistence. I don't know what other words there are. I don't have a thesaurus on me.
6635820	6654820	Is it possible to head first instead of swinging? Honestly, I have no idea.
6654820	6672820	Like, I would love to... I feel like I'm gonna flip, so I just... I don't know. I don't know, senpai. I don't know.
6672820	6675820	That one goes back down to the beginning.
6675820	6704820	I want to get closer but I'm also kind of worried that I won't be able to swing far enough.
6706820	6708820	Hmm?
6718820	6726820	I just made him do a weird shimmy! I just made him do the Stingin' Nansen!
6726820	6729820	Attarashi Gakkou!
6732820	6734820	Otona Blue.
6735820	6736820	Hup.
6740820	6741820	Alright.
6741820	6760820	Hmm. This part's hard. I'm... I don't know. Maybe I need to watch a video of someone doing it?
6760820	6769820	But I feel like that's cheating. I feel like that's cheating. And I'm not a cheater. I'm a quitter, but not a cheater!
6769820	6775820	I'm like, you guys! And I'm like, senpai's! Cheater, cheating.
6796820	6798820	Oh, shit.
6800820	6801820	Hmm.
6801820	6802820	Oh.
6803820	6804820	Hup.
6805820	6806820	Hup.
6808820	6809820	Hup.
6819820	6820820	Hup.
6823820	6824820	Hup.
6826820	6827820	Hup.
6833820	6834820	Hup.
6845820	6854820	I don't know which rock it is that I should... Like, I can't tell if I should be, like, trying this rock or this rock.
6862820	6863820	Hup.
6865820	6866820	Hup.
6868820	6869820	Hup.
6874820	6875820	Hup.
6877820	6878820	Hup.
6883820	6884820	Hup.
6886820	6888820	Buh!
6892820	6893820	Hup.
6898820	6899820	Hup!
6899820	6900820	Hup!
6904820	6906820	He didn't hold on.
6906820	6907820	Hup.
6921820	6926820	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I almost had it and then I failed.
6926820	6927820	Hup.
6931820	6932820	Hup.
6936820	6937820	Hup.
6939820	6940820	Hup.
6942820	6943820	Hup.
6944820	6949820	I want such a hard area. I don't know why it's such a hard area.
6950820	6952820	I know why.
6952820	6954820	Game Devs Evil.
6956820	6959820	Why did I decide to play this game?
6959820	6963820	How many hours in? I'm nearly two hours in and I suck!
6963820	6967820	I recognize my weaknesses, Senpai. Do you recognize your weaknesses?
6967820	6970820	My weakness includes...
6972820	6976820	My weakness includes impatience!
6977820	6981820	But at the same time, I'm a little stubborn.
6993820	6994820	Hup.
7002820	7003820	There we go.
7003820	7032300	I'm your greatest weakness, Senpai!
7032300	7039300	I think it was here.
7039300	7049380	So, uh, I didn't get it.
7049380	7055940	I didn't get it.
7055940	7056940	I'm back!
7056940	7058340	Did Mercy make it to the top?
7058340	7061780	No, we're back at the bottom, and now, well, we're in the bottom still.
7061780	7076380	Oh, he always slips there.
7076380	7080580	I intercept back.
7080580	7081580	We got this.
7081580	7082580	Yeah, we got this.
7082580	7083580	We still winning.
7083580	7086700	We're in the grind mindset.
7086700	7102420	Um, every day your life is, uh, uh, is a power tool made to rock?
7102420	7104580	I don't fucking know.
7104580	7118260	Oh, something about Northern Lion.
7118260	7134140	I mean, MC's bald, yeah.
7134140	7155180	Sometimes I look at life and I go, what would, what would this bald man Northern Lion would
7155180	7156180	say?
7157100	7172340	And I force it on to other people.
7172340	7193820	Something involving hammers, probably, and then I start getting angry and then maybe
7193820	7203260	I'll use the hammers on Senpai.
7203260	7204260	Is it this?
7204260	7206340	I can't remember which rock it was.
7206340	7208500	Was it this rock?
7208500	7222140	Which rock did I vibe with Senpai?
7222140	7225900	I couldn't remember which rock I vibe with.
7225900	7226900	This one?
7226900	7229020	Is it this rock that I vibe with?
7229020	7237060	This one right here on the little corner, this little sliver?
7237060	7238380	Or did I go the one up?
7238380	7239380	No, go up.
7239380	7240380	Okay.
7240380	7250420	This was the one that I, I vibe with.
7250420	7251700	Bottom of the middle rock.
7251700	7258980	Was it this bottom of the middle rock that I vibe with?
7258980	7261580	This bottom.
7261580	7262580	This bottom.
7262580	7277540	And I'm not talking about, like, you know, a bit higher.
7277540	7280100	What about here was the vibe?
7280100	7281100	Alright.
7281100	7290100	That was not the vibe.
7290100	7293660	Me and you?
7293660	7303860	Well, I'm at the bottom here.
7303860	7307700	Good check failed.
7307700	7308700	Every time.
7308700	7310900	I just don't like it.
7310900	7315900	It doesn't mesh with my karma.
7315900	7324380	It just doesn't mesh with my karma Senpai.
7324380	7338820	That area is full of negative energy.
7338820	7364420	Really a Scorpio.
7364420	7369020	I don't know what else they say.
7369020	7370020	Oh man.
7370020	7371020	What if I get a rock?
7371020	7375700	I have like some, some, some like, some like rocks.
7375700	7380380	And then what if I get a rock and then I pray to that rock and then be like, yes, let's
7380380	7389700	meditate on this rock so we can make this jump.
7419700	7429180	I swung.
7429180	7430180	Was it not hard?
7430180	7431180	Air guitar.
7431180	7443620	I don't know what I forgot what guitar sounds like because I don't really listen to music.
7443620	7456820	So in my mind, when you said like, oh, you air guitar down, I was like, air banjo, it's
7456820	7457820	dead.
7457820	7469820	It's like I'm in here or something.
7469820	7499340	Oh, unless we're talking about the guitar, is it a guitar?
7500340	7501980	I've been watching Yu Yu Hakusho.
7501980	7504580	So I have Yu Yu Hakusho brain rot right now.
7504580	7515260	So the sound effect.
7515260	7516260	Something happens.
7516260	7525260	Do you remember Senpai?
7525260	7543540	Right now I'm on the arc where the arc following what's his face's plan to open the kick kai
7543540	7567980	barrier kick kai means barrier.
7567980	7568980	Yeah.
7568980	7569980	Right now we have.
7570820	7571820	Oh my gosh.
7571820	7572820	Close your ears.
7572820	7577980	Oh, close your ears right now.
7577980	7584100	Currently demon guy was like, I'm hungry, I can't take it anymore.
7584100	7585100	And that's where I'm at.
7585100	7586100	That's it.
7586100	7587100	That's the part I'm at.
7587100	7612460	Oh, I'm still scared Senpai.
7612460	7613460	I'm still scared.
7613460	7615500	I don't actually remember how I did it.
7616500	7617500	I don't remember how I did it.
7639500	7640500	Just do it.
7640500	7650500	Give me a second, let me test something.
7650500	7656500	Okay, I definitely swing back if I let go there.
7656500	7660500	I have to let go as I'm swinging.
7660500	7667500	Senpai!
7667500	7682500	We did it!
7683500	7688500	Wow!
7688500	7704500	Huh, now I'm stuck.
7734500	7763500	We live here now.
7764500	7766500	I'm sweating from my neck.
7766500	7778500	I can feel the sweat dripping down my neck right now.
7778500	7780500	This is where we live now.
7780500	7796500	We're home now.
7796500	7821500	This is our rock.
7821500	7845500	This is where we live now.
7845500	7874500	This is where we live now.
7874500	7899500	This is where we live now.
7899500	7927500	This is where we live now.
7927500	7928500	That's all that mattered.
7928500	7935500	We peaked once.
7935500	7943500	We peaked once.
7943500	7949500	I was so close Senpai.
7949500	7961500	I was so close.
7961500	7966500	I didn't know I was slip and slide right there.
7966500	7972500	My slip and slide days.
7972500	7975500	I assume you're already familiar with getting over it.
7975500	7978500	Yeah, and guess what?
7978500	7980500	I got over it.
7980500	7982500	Actually, I didn't get over it.
7982500	8000500	I got to the one area with all the curls and then I just gave up there.
8000500	8002500	I can't believe there was a slide there.
8002500	8007500	I was like, okay, just swing and then I...
8007500	8009500	I was like, okay, well, grab onto that area.
8009500	8011500	It'll be fine.
8011500	8019500	Slip and slide, baby.
8019500	8020500	Did you get to the anvil?
8020500	8022500	I think I got to the anvil.
8022500	8028500	I'm not sure.
8028500	8050500	I made it to peak and then I fell off.
8050500	8057500	That's how it goes, right?
8057500	8084500	I fell off, literally.
8084500	8101500	We can peak again.
8101500	8102500	I gave up.
8102500	8105500	I can't believe you would have that vocabulary in you, Mercy Modest.
8105500	8107500	Well, guess what?
8107500	8108500	I do.
8108500	8112500	I'm a quitter, but not a cheater.
8112500	8118500	Except for when cheating feels good in games.
8118500	8120500	Do you know Black Clover?
8120500	8122500	Does anyone know Black Clover?
8122500	8124500	I'm going to give you a spoiler.
8124500	8127500	When Asta, they were cheating in this tournament thing
8127500	8131500	and then Asta was like, you weren't cheating?
8131500	8133500	Why didn't you tell me I wanted to cheat, too?
8133500	8144500	And I felt that.
8144500	8146500	No, we're not cheating that way.
8146500	8151500	We're talking about cheating in games, you know?
8151500	8157500	The only cheaters I know is you, Senpai.
8157500	8165500	That's why you have to cut off your fingers sometimes.
8165500	8176500	Oh my gosh, do not make this about NTR.
8176500	8189500	It's like you guys have brain rot.
8189500	8191500	It's like some Senpais have brain rot for NTR
8191500	8198500	and that's all they can think about.
8198500	8200500	You know what NTR I think about?
8200500	8224500	New times, Romans.
8224500	8231500	I'm just saying.
8231500	8233500	I'm just saying.
8233500	8235500	I don't want questions about that anymore.
8235500	8237500	I don't want questions about that.
8237500	8239500	I want people to assume anything.
8239500	8246500	Why? Because I only love my Senpais.
8246500	8248500	New times, Romans, good.
8248500	8263500	It's a good font.
8263500	8264500	It's a good font.
8264500	8275500	I promise Senpais that I only have Senpai in my heart.
8275500	8287500	And maybe Serenity, sorry.
8287500	8307500	Serenity in my gym mate, sorry.
8307500	8327500	See the power of my gen mates in Serenity.
8327500	8356500	Serenity in my gym mate.
8356500	8369500	I feel like...
8369500	8389500	Can we get higher before?
8389500	8404500	I slept.
8404500	8417500	I slept. That was scary.
8417500	8430500	By the power of Serenity and my gen mates Azra, Imi, Isi, Shibi, Strony.
8430500	8454500	I will make it.
8454500	8482500	Oh no, my mouse is so sweaty.
8482500	8502500	My hands are making me sweat.
8502500	8528500	My hands are making me sweat.
8528500	8544500	My hands are making me sweat.
8544500	8560500	I did it, I did it, I did it.
8560500	8565500	My gamer license has been reinstated.
8565500	8573500	I made progress but now my hands are really sweaty.
8573500	8577500	I'm super sweaty now.
8577500	8591500	I might be a real gamer because of how sweaty I am.
8591500	8593500	I think I just flowed here for a little bit.
8593500	8595500	Look at my little oasis.
8595500	8597500	Yeah.
8597500	8600500	Yeah, my little oasis with my little waterfall.
8600500	8603500	I got these beautiful leaves.
8603500	8605500	This wonderful ambience.
8605500	8607500	Do you have any gamer gloves?
8607500	8623500	No.
8623500	8625500	We live here now.
8625500	8634500	Why would we want to go more?
8635500	8637500	I don't normally game this hard.
8637500	8639500	Oh, the carpal tunnel though.
8639500	8649500	I feel it in my fingies.
8649500	8651500	I really feel it.
8651500	8654500	It's so sore now.
8654500	8657500	Can I save here?
8657500	8663500	Am I allowed to save or does it start at the beginning again?
8663500	8673500	I don't know.
8673500	8681500	Carpal tunnel.
8681500	8683500	I'm so sweaty now.
8683500	8694500	My neck feels like a waterfall.
8694500	8697500	Where is the bath water?
8697500	8702500	My bath is kind of small.
8702500	8728500	How do we get past here?
8728500	8734500	All of the roots, just be careful.
8734500	8739500	This is kind of scary.
8739500	8748500	These roots?
8748500	8751500	I don't feel safe out of my oasis.
8751500	8757500	I'm going back to my oasis.
8757500	8763500	I don't feel safe outside of my oasis.
8763500	8766500	That area was so dark.
8766500	8772500	I was like, this is an area that's dangerous.
8772500	8782500	We live here now.
8782500	8789500	This is where we live.
8789500	8793500	This oasis probably has fish, right?
8793500	8803500	We'll fish together some pie.
8803500	8805500	We can eat the leaves.
8805500	8814500	These are good nutritious leaves.
8814500	8820500	You can probably be free in this area without your cages.
8820500	8828500	Where else would you go?
8828500	8834500	Why would you leave my oasis?
8834500	8844500	You can always go down.
8844500	8854500	I worked really hard to get here.
8854500	8864500	I'm going back to my oasis.
8864500	8890500	I'm going back to my oasis.
8890500	8915500	I'm going back to my oasis.
8915500	8928500	I'm going back to my oasis.
8928500	8932500	This is where I live now.
8932500	8936500	We all live here.
8936500	8951500	We collect berries and go collecting berries.
8951500	8955500	This area looks dangerous.
8955500	8965500	I'm kind of scared of it.
8986500	8989500	How's the wi-fi here? I don't know. Check it.
8989500	9012500	I think it's good.
9012500	9020500	We live here now.
9020500	9030500	Do I have to go for bush to bush?
9050500	9072500	How do I get bush to bush?
9072500	9088500	Maybe this bush and then go to that bush.
9088500	9092500	Maybe that bush and we swing.
9092500	9094500	I was already at that bush.
9094500	9096500	Is that the bush I was supposed to go to?
9122500	9132500	I don't know if I can reach that high.
9132500	9142500	I don't know if I can reach that high.
9142500	9158500	I don't know if I can reach that high.
9158500	9187500	I'm stuck here.
9187500	9189500	We live here forever.
9189500	9192500	Why do we want to move anyways?
9192500	9198500	What is the climb?
9218500	9222500	No!
9222500	9234500	Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!
9234500	9236500	Senpai!
9236500	9246500	Shit!
9246500	9256500	Is it just me or are these not easy to reach?
9266500	9295500	Is it just me or are these not easy to reach?
9295500	9305500	Is this going to break?
9326500	9335500	I'm stuck here.
9335500	9345500	Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!
9345500	9355500	Senpai, I'm a gamer!
9355500	9367500	This looks dangerous.
9367500	9377500	I don't think I'm ready for this yet.
9377500	9395500	Water! Water safe! Water!
9395500	9405500	This is scary Senpai!
9405500	9411500	This part is a part where everybody drops, don't they?
9411500	9425500	Oh god.
9441500	9461500	I lost my home!
9461500	9470500	Look, he just floats.
9470500	9498500	Senpai, we're homeless again!
9498500	9503500	Now the sea only tastes like salt.
9503500	9517500	Where is that my tears?
9517500	9520500	We live here now.
9520500	9522500	That was it.
9522500	9523500	I knew it.
9523500	9526500	That sign was dangerous and I knew it and we all knew it.
9526500	9534500	I'm too tired for this now.
9534500	9536500	We rage quit, yeah.
9536500	9538500	Yeah, we rage.
9538500	9545500	We rage quit.
9545500	9548500	We live in a society.
9548500	9555500	We live in a society where bald men who can't use their legs
9555500	9558500	can't even find a home.
9558500	9565500	The housing market is terrible.
9565500	9567500	I made it to peak.
9567500	9570500	I made it to our little oasis.
9570500	9574500	I went past our little oasis because I wanted more.
9574500	9577500	I should have just been happy with what I had.
9577500	9596500	I just became so greedy.
9596500	9603500	We should have just lived in the oasis.
9603500	9612500	We were homeowners.
9612500	9616500	I don't know how long we were homeowners, but I wanted more.
9616500	9618500	The Home Owners Association.
9618500	9623500	I wanted to be the president of the Home Owners Association.
9623500	9626500	And then we just, we failed.
9626500	9629500	We failed.
9629500	9631500	I'm so sad.
9631500	9633500	So sad, Senpai.
9633500	9635500	But what did we learn from that?
9635500	9653500	We learned that the power of friendship is the most powerful thing.
9653500	9658500	We wanted a house in this economy.
9658500	9666500	Heck, I was even, heck, I was even, I was even going to pay my mortgage.
9666500	9674500	My mortgage with the climb.
9674500	9675500	Are we only friends to Yuka?
9675500	9677500	I know.
9677500	9681500	My Senpais are in a loving relationship with me.
9681500	9685500	My friendship is with my girls.
9685500	9691500	Girls.
9691500	9694500	Well, thank you.
9694500	9698500	Set up for the 420.
9698500	9699500	I really appreciate it.
9699500	9700500	You did your best.
9700500	9702500	Thank you.
9702500	9708500	Thank you so much.
9708500	9710500	We have the down payment.
9710500	9714500	And then we have to pay the principal.
9714500	9717500	And then we have to fight the other homeowners.
9717500	9723500	We have to fight the businesses that want to convert the entire area into a BNB,
9723500	9734500	a BNB enterprise, an Airbnb enterprise.
9734500	9743500	Man, homeownership's rough.
9743500	9752500	Corporal.
9752500	9756500	Corporal's always coming in, gentrifying the place.
9756500	9759500	The homeowners association hates me.
9759500	9761500	They hate me because I wear an eye patch.
9761500	9768500	That's it, right?
9768500	9770500	Although that is my dream, though.
9770500	9772500	I really do want to own my own place.
9772500	9785500	So I can have more freedom.
9785500	9788500	They won't even let me.
9788500	9797500	The homeowners association won't even let me have pink curtains.
9797500	9798500	I don't know.
9798500	9805500	Is those fancy apartments and flats?
9805500	9809500	Do they have homeowners associations or whatever?
9809500	9815500	Where they're like, you can't have colorful curtains.
9815500	9825500	Because then it brings the property down.
9825500	9827500	Sacrilege, I know.
9827500	9829500	I want my pink curtains.
9829500	9831500	Actually, my curtains are kind of like an off-white,
9831500	9835500	but they're like sheer and they look very ethereal.
9835500	9844500	Like a wedding dress, you know?
9844500	9846500	Will there be a yard to play in?
9846500	9847500	I don't know.
9847500	9850500	I don't like, I don't really like taking care of yards.
9850500	9853500	I don't like mowing, you know?
9853500	9869500	I don't like mowing.
9869500	9876500	Tempies won't take care of the mowing.
9876500	9881500	Off-light, off-light is prettier, I think.
9881500	9883500	Look at my tempi.
9883500	9884500	Let's be real.
9884500	9887500	If I wore white, look at my skin tone.
9887500	9890500	I would be blinding you, right?
9890500	9895500	I would be blinding you.
9895500	9898500	Tempies will do the landscaping?
9898500	9899500	Okay.
9899500	9910500	I want a fruit tree then.
9910500	9912500	I want a fruit tree so we can pick...
9912500	9913500	I don't know.
9913500	9914500	What grows on trees?
9914500	9915500	Apples?
9915500	9917500	We can pick apples.
9917500	9919500	Apples in the...
9919500	9921500	What time do apples...
9921500	9923500	What time are apples?
9923500	9926500	That depends on the place, right?
9926500	9932500	What time are apples in season?
9932500	9935500	Speaking of...
9935500	9936500	I want to tell you guys something.
9936500	9939500	It's kind of dumb.
9939500	9942500	But I was at a store.
9942500	9949500	I was at a store and I overheard these girls talking.
9949500	9952500	We can pick them in the fall then.
9952500	9954500	We can pick the apples in the fall.
9954500	9956500	So I overheard these girls talking.
9956500	9958500	I think they're fairly young.
9958500	9960500	And they were talking about Animal Crossing.
9960500	9961500	And they were like,
9961500	9963500	Why aren't there any strawberry trees?
9963500	9965500	And I didn't have the heart to say
9965500	9969500	Strawberry girls on bushes.
9969500	9971500	I didn't have the heart to say it.
9971500	9974500	I was listening and I was like...
9974500	9976500	What am I...
9976500	9981500	That's the reason why I don't have it.
9981500	9994500	I didn't have the heart to say it.
9994500	10000500	I remember I used to own some little strawberry plants.
10000500	10002500	I don't think they grow on vines.
10002500	10011500	But they were definitely in these little...
10011500	10014500	I guess tiny bushes like a little patch.
10014500	10016500	Where you can just pick them up.
10016500	10019500	I remember Papa Mercy.
10019500	10023500	Papa Mercy.
10023500	10028500	Decided to give them away as a gift to someone.
10028500	10029500	And I was like,
10029500	10046500	Damn, no more cute strawberry picking.
10046500	10052500	I thought of some names for Mama and Papa.
10052500	10058500	But I feel like I would just say Mama and Papa.
10058500	10060500	I think it would be really interesting though.
10060500	10061500	What do you guys...
10061500	10074500	What does my sump ice think?
10074500	10076500	I thought of some names.
10076500	10084500	Like their real names.
10084500	10088500	Papa's name is Please and Mama's name is Forgiveness.
10088500	10114500	Please.
10114500	10115500	Please.
10115500	10116500	Please.
10116500	10119500	And forgiveness, please.
10119500	10120500	It's hard to remember.
10120500	10121500	What do you mean?
10121500	10126500	It's the last thing you say sometimes when you're about to die.
10126500	10144500	Or when you're caught cheating.
10144500	10146500	It was yes, forgiveness.
10146500	10147500	I don't know.
10147500	10149500	Maybe like forgive me.
10149500	10156500	But like forgiveness.
10156500	10158500	Like dearest for mommy.
10158500	10164500	Mommy dearest.
10164500	10168500	Was Papa Mama Senpai?
10168500	10170500	She can be a little possessive of them.
10170500	10173500	Yeah.
10173500	10178500	Yeah, please, plus forgiveness equals mercy.
10178500	10190500	I'm just going full meta right now.
10191500	10196500	It never dead Rückney again.
10197500	10198500	Please.
10198500	10202500	Please and forgive
10207500	10210500	For you sounds like sounds like I forgot
10213500	10215500	I forgot
10218500	10220500	I forgive
10221500	10223500	Ha ha ha ha ha
10227500	10230500	Maybe Mama and Papa Mercy would be good
10232500	10234500	Ha ha ha ha
10236500	10238500	Ha ha ha ha ha
10241500	10244500	Yeah, Mama and Papa would try explaining every time
10244500	10248500	Well, at least you guys get to know Mama and Papa's name
10248500	10252500	That means you're ready for when you can pop the question
10252500	10257500	and ask for their permission to marry their daughter, right?
10261500	10262500	Ha ha ha
10267500	10270500	So you're ready, but it's not time yet
10273500	10275500	Ha ha ha ha ha
10279500	10283500	Mama Mercy, Mama Modisse is too good to replace
10283500	10284500	Hmm, okay
10284500	10286500	We're thinking about marriage
10288500	10291500	Were you, were you not thinking about marriage?
10292500	10293500	Hello?
10295500	10296500	Hello?
10296500	10297500	Hello?
10306500	10307500	That won't be the right time
10307500	10309500	Well, we have to go on so many dates first
10309500	10312500	Then we have to get to know each other way more
10312500	10315500	And then, you know
10317500	10318500	You know
10319500	10320500	You know
10320500	10322500	Ha ha ha ha ha ha
10322500	10324500	Ha ha ha ha
10330500	10332500	One thing at a time
10340500	10343500	So we can go on dates on the outside, of course
10344500	10347500	Unless you're trying to find help
10347500	10349500	No one will help you some pie
10349500	10351500	Only I will
10356500	10358500	This was a rock climbing date
10358500	10361500	This was us trying to find a home, okay?
10361500	10364500	This was us trying to find a home
10364500	10365500	Ha ha ha ha
10365500	10367500	This was us climbing
10367500	10370500	Climbing to find a home
10370500	10371500	To get a mortgage
10371500	10373500	To pay the principal
10374500	10376500	Get a down payment
10376500	10379500	Then we got kicked out by the homeowners association
10384500	10385500	Ha ha ha ha
10387500	10389500	Ha ha ha ha
10390500	10391500	I mean like
10391500	10394500	The basement's getting a little bit crowded, right?
10395500	10398500	Some, some senpais have to share cages
10401500	10405500	So for now, we're gonna have to have a homeless date
10405500	10408500	No, we're gonna just move back into the basement now
10408500	10410500	Ha ha ha ha
10412500	10415500	We're just gonna have to move back into the basement
10415500	10416500	Ugh
10416500	10418500	Sadge

10438500	10441500	You know, we're getting ready for our first date with everyone
10446500	10447500	Ha ha ha
10448500	10451500	What about a 5k twitter audio?
10455500	10456500	To be honest
10456500	10458500	Um
10461500	10463500	I grew so fast
10463500	10465500	I'm getting kind of scared
10467500	10469500	I'm getting kind of scared
10469500	10471500	I think it's more eyes on me
10471500	10473500	So I'm getting a little bit more shy
10477500	10479500	I'm getting a little bit more shy
10482500	10483500	Ha ha ha ha
10483500	10485500	So because I'm getting a little bit more shy
10485500	10489500	I'm getting a little bit more nervous to post a new audio
10493500	10495500	So which is why I'm just like

10503500	10506500	I'm gonna share an intimate moment
10506500	10510500	But like maybe someone's gonna be spying on my intimate moment
10510500	10511500	With my senpais
10513500	10514500	Ha ha ha
10516500	10517500	I guess
10521500	10523500	It might take a little bit
10523500	10526500	I said soon, but it might be more like later
10532500	10534500	It might be more like later
10534500	10536500	I'm too shy right now
10542500	10543500	I'm too shy right now
10543500	10545500	I was honestly
10545500	10547500	You know, I went to bed and I was like
10547500	10548500	Okay, 3k
10548500	10550500	Yeah, that's doable
10550500	10552500	Cool, I knew senpais
10552500	10553500	And then
10553500	10555500	I woke up and I was like
10555500	10557500	Oh, it went up to 4k
10559500	10561500	I woke up because of the call
10561500	10563500	Call of
10563500	10565500	About like my water being turned off
10565500	10567500	And I was like, okay
10567500	10569500	And then I was like
10569500	10571500	I'll go back to bed
10571500	10574500	And then, you know, I'll do it later
10574500	10576500	And then I woke up
10578500	10579500	To 6k
10579500	10580500	So basically
10580500	10582500	Almost double
10583500	10584500	Double
10586500	10588500	Of what I like originally
10588500	10589500	Was like, oh

10605500	10607500	I accidentally found the algorithm
10607500	10609500	I didn't even realize
10609500	10611500	I just, I was like
10611500	10612500	Originally
10612500	10613500	At 2k

10657500	10659500	What about Strony?
10661500	10663500	Wait is Strony still streaming?
10673500	10675500	Yeah, the vtubers supporting me
10675500	10676500	Are pretty base

10679500	10680500	I wanna like

10687500	10688500	She wants to raid in
10688500	10689500	But not sure if you're ending soon
10689500	10691500	This might turn into a long, longer
10691500	10692500	Yap, I'm sorry
10694500	10695500	Yeah, she's fine
10695500	10696500	If she wants to raid in
10696500	10698500	This might turn into a like
10698500	10700500	Maybe another hour long
10704500	10705500	You know, yap
10713500	10715500	Strony's definitely built different
10715500	10717500	I thought I had a pretty
10717500	10719500	Strong, um
10722500	10724500	I thought I had a pretty strong stamina
10724500	10727500	But I think Strony has like a stronger stamina
10732500	10734500	I'm of course fine with
10734500	10736500	Going just
10736500	10739500	If Senpai's are okay with me being a little sweaty
10739500	10740500	Hahaha
10744500	10746500	If I'm a little sweaty
10758500	10760500	Sweaty's good, yeah
10761500	10763500	Strony did an 8 plus hour stream
10763500	10764500	3 days in a row
10764500	10766500	Strony's too powerful
10766500	10767500	Honestly

10782500	10784500	12 hours, wild honestly
10784500	10785500	Did she take breaks?
10785500	10787500	I hope she took breaks
10788500	10791500	Yeah, I want Strony to take
10791500	10792500	Lost a rest
10792500	10794500	Honestly, Strony works really hard
10795500	10796500	Especially for us
10797500	10798500	Hahaha
10803500	10805500	That's wild
10805500	10807500	That's wild
10807500	10809500	I don't know if I have that stamina
10809500	10811500	Honestly, usually

10840500	10843500	Of maybe like 4 hours, 5 hours max
10843500	10845500	Otherwise
10847500	10849500	I feel like
10849500	10852500	I feel like I'm going to overwork my mods
10853500	10856500	I feel like I'll overwork the mods
10856500	10858500	If that happens
10863500	10864500	Let's go

10944500	10945500	Hahaha
10948500	10949500	Hi
10949500	10952500	I actually had a craving for McDonald's last night
10953500	10954500	I actually went out
10954500	10957500	I drove to McDonald's last night
10957500	10958500	And
10958500	10959500	I didn't
10960500	10962500	I had a very specific craving

10980500	10981500	I don't know
10981500	10983500	I feel like the fountain drinks
10983500	10985500	At McDonald's taste different, right?
10994500	10995500	Hahaha
10996500	10997500	That's very specific
10997500	10998500	I had a craving for it
10998500	11000500	I had a really big craving for it
11000500	11002500	I was like, I need this right now
11002500	11004500	And there's one about like
11005500	11007500	Like a five minute drive away
11007500	11009500	And they have a 24 hour drive through
11009500	11011500	So I was like, can I please
11011500	11014500	Have a large fountain drink

11016500	11017500	Hahaha
11023500	11024500	So
11024500	11027500	That's what I wanted
11027500	11029500	Specifically
11029500	11030500	Hahaha
11032500	11034500	And they were like, that's it
11034500	11036500	And I said, yep, that's it
11037500	11039500	How much is it?
11040500	11041500	Paid the price
11043500	11045500	Parked in the parking lot
11045500	11047500	Took a few sips
11048500	11050500	Started dissociating
11051500	11053500	Wondered about life
11053500	11055500	Pried a little bit
11055500	11057500	Went back home
11058500	11059500	Kicked on my supplies
11059500	11061500	They were all sleeping nice
11061500	11062500	Hahaha
11062500	11064500	And I went to bed
11064500	11065500	Hahaha
11069500	11071500	Hahaha
11071500	11072500	Hahaha

11076500	11078500	Ah, it happens sometimes
11078500	11080500	I'm in a little bit of a
11081500	11083500	I'm in a little bit of a downer mood
11083500	11085500	Not thing in per
11086500	11088500	Maybe it is something in particular
11090500	11092500	I think it's just
11093500	11094500	I don't know
11095500	11097500	I guess it's a bit of a
11097500	11098500	Imposter syndrome?
11098500	11099500	Yeah
11099500	11101500	I was feeling down because of the imposter syndrome
11108500	11109500	Hahaha
11113500	11115500	So then I was like, oh
11116500	11118500	You know, going through
11118500	11120500	Going through the motions
11120500	11122500	Like literally, I go through the motions
11122500	11124500	And then I get sad
11126500	11128500	You know, I should be happy with my growth
11128500	11130500	But I'm like a little scared of it
11130500	11131500	Hahaha
11135500	11137500	I'm a little scared of it because
11142500	11145500	I've never had so many eyes on me before
11145500	11146500	Hahaha
11147500	11148500	So now I get a little shy
11148500	11149500	I get really shy
11149500	11151500	And I'm like, oh
11151500	11153500	Should I think more about what I do?
11158500	11159500	Hahaha
11162500	11164500	Yeah, we did talk about the
11164500	11166500	Love reading how wrong the chat summary can be
11166500	11169500	Apparently chat is talking about wanting her to go live
11169500	11171500	And her talking about her hatred for
11171500	11173500	Homeowners Association and love for McDonald's
11173500	11176500	Well, we got the Homeowners Association
11176500	11177500	Things are afraid
11177500	11178500	Hahaha
11179500	11181500	It was a metaphor
11181500	11182500	It was a metaphor
11183500	11184500	Hahaha
11184500	11185500	Oh
11188500	11189500	Hahaha
11192500	11194500	It was a metaphor
11194500	11196500	We got to an oasis
11196500	11198500	In a difficult game about climbing
11200500	11201500	Hahaha
11201500	11203500	And then I wanted more
11203500	11205500	And then I got kicked out
11206500	11207500	Oh, some pie
11207500	11209500	Thank you for the $4 news
11209500	11211500	What's the word for the day?
11212500	11215500	What's the word of the day for English again?
11215500	11216500	Hmm, let me think
11219500	11220500	Dichotomy
11221500	11222500	Hahaha
11223500	11225500	Word of the day is dichotomy
11226500	11227500	Hahaha
11232500	11233500	Hahaha
11234500	11235500	Hahaha
11238500	11239500	Another D word
11240500	11241500	Hahaha
11241500	11244500	Maybe I just have like the D dictionary in my head
11244500	11245500	Hahaha
11249500	11250500	Hahaha
11253500	11254500	Here
11263500	11264500	Dichotomy
11264500	11267500	A division or contrast between two things
11267500	11271500	That are or are represented by being opposed
11271500	11273500	Or entirely different
11273500	11275500	An example would be a rigid dichotomy
11275500	11278500	Rigid dichotomy between science and mysticism
11279500	11280500	Hahaha

11417500	11419500	You're doing such a good job
11419500	11420500	I always knew you all
11420500	11422500	You had the makings of being a teacher
11422500	11424500	And I just couldn't

11425500	11427500	I couldn't say no
11427500	11429500	I was like oh

11473500	11475500	I'm sorry if this already been said
11475500	11476500	But your gen mates
11476500	11478500	I think I see is missing
11478500	11479500	Huh?
11481500	11482500	In my
11482500	11483500	In my
11483500	11485500	In my description
11486500	11488500	I'll hit manai san for that
11488500	11489500	Hahaha
11489500	11491500	I'll hit manager for that
11491500	11492500	Hahaha
11502500	11504500	Would you say you have old parents
11504500	11506500	Or just super innocent?
11508500	11510500	Maybe a bit amicable
11510500	11512500	Umm
11512500	11514500	They're very
11514500	11516500	They were very strict with me
11516500	11518500	They were very strict with me
11518500	11520500	But like suddenly
11520500	11521500	I got like
11521500	11523500	They're like you're an adult now
11523500	11525500	You have so much
11525500	11526500	So much
11526500	11528500	Hahaha
11533500	11535500	Where was it?
11535500	11536500	Is it in the description?
11536500	11538500	Is the description
11538500	11540500	Doesn't have icy?
11540500	11542500	Manager fix that

11554500	11556500	Why does that 20% go?
11556500	11558500	Hahaha
11562500	11564500	Hahaha
11572500	11574500	Hahaha
11578500	11579500	Okay
11579500	11580500	Manai
11580500	11582500	Manai can get on it
11582500	11584500	Hahaha
11588500	11590500	I always bully manager
11590500	11592500	But I do respect manager
11592500	11594500	Manager is what
11594500	11596500	Rains us in
11596500	11598500	Hahaha
11601500	11603500	Hahaha
11603500	11605500	Manager is what rains us in
11605500	11607500	So we can be free
11612500	11614500	Hahaha
11614500	11615500	So we can be free
11615500	11617500	To a certain extent
11621500	11623500	It's manager Senpai
11623500	11625500	Or no manager is manager
11630500	11632500	Discussing sounds
11636500	11638500	Manager is manager
11638500	11640500	Hahaha
11640500	11641500	Senpai on the other hand
11641500	11643500	I love Senpai
11650500	11652500	Ironically I think they copy and pasted
11652500	11653500	Icy's description
11653500	11655500	So Icy was missing from the list of gen mates
11655500	11657500	That's probably why
11657500	11660500	Efficiency comes at the cost
11660500	11662500	And the cost is
11662500	11664500	You know some details
11667500	11669500	Would you love us even if we were a worm?
11669500	11671500	Yes of course
11671500	11673500	You'll be the cutest worm ever
11673500	11675500	Hahaha
11679500	11681500	Thank you
11681500	11683500	By the two dollary dudes
11683500	11685500	Teach me some pie
11685500	11687500	What am I teaching?
11687500	11689500	More words?
11689500	11691500	Hahaha
11693500	11695500	Can I be a gummy worm?
11695500	11698500	Yeah gummy worm is natural cage habitat
11698500	11700500	Hahaha
11704500	11705500	It's probably it
11705500	11707500	Efficiency
11707500	11709500	Efficiency sometimes leads to
11709500	11711500	Missing details
11711500	11713500	At least you all caught it
11719500	11721500	Thank you for catching it
11721500	11723500	I always get ready for stream
11725500	11727500	Mostly the whole day is
11727500	11729500	Um
11732500	11734500	Well let's see what my schedule is
11734500	11736500	Kind of like my schedule is
11736500	11738500	Like planning the day stream
11738500	11740500	Mm-hmm
11740500	11742500	And then
11745500	11747500	And then
11749500	11751500	Um catching up on chores
11751500	11753500	And things
11753500	11755500	Uh
11755500	11757500	On Twitter or promotional stuff
11761500	11763500	Planning the following weeks
11763500	11765500	And
11765500	11767500	Organize and collapse
11769500	11770500	It's a lot
11770500	11773500	Oh yeah and then I have to do my audios as well
11773500	11775500	So
11775500	11777500	It might seem like they're small tasks
11777500	11779500	But they can take quite a long time
11780500	11782500	Canonically
11782500	11785500	How many arms, fingers and toes do you have?
11785500	11787500	How many times did you cheat?
11787500	11789500	Hahaha
11790500	11792500	Do senpai scroll them back
11792500	11794500	For you to cut them again?
11794500	11796500	I might ask
11796500	11798500	Me to like
11798500	11800500	Resurrect senpai
11800500	11802500	So I can just kill senpai again
11802500	11804500	In Minecraft
11804500	11806500	Hahaha
11810500	11812500	Zero if you hit zero
11812500	11814500	Then you have all of your limbs
11816500	11818500	But if it's
11818500	11820500	Even just one
11820500	11822500	Some parts might be missing
11825500	11827500	Hahaha
11833500	11835500	That's all
11839500	11841500	So
11841500	11843500	What else
11843500	11845500	What else
11845500	11847500	Oh yeah and then I
11847500	11849500	Do a lot of chores and stuff
11849500	11851500	Yeah
11851500	11853500	I have to make sure everything's kind of in order as well
11853500	11855500	A lot of things are taken care of
11855500	11857500	By manager and
11857500	11859500	The team
11859500	11861500	But you know there's still some stuff that I have to
11861500	11863500	Do
11863500	11865500	I definitely feel very blessed
11865500	11867500	To be in VLR
11867500	11869500	Because a lot of it is definitely
11869500	11871500	A
11871500	11873500	Just go and make
11873500	11875500	And create and do
11875500	11877500	And
11877500	11879500	And stream
11887500	11889500	It's not a bit too lenient to take
11889500	11891500	A limb for cheating
11893500	11895500	I'm so nice don't you think senpai?
11897500	11899500	I'm so nice that I give you so many chances
11907500	11909500	Just got to get stuff out there since the very beginning
11909500	11911500	Mmm
11911500	11913500	It's a lot of
11913500	11915500	Planning
11915500	11917500	So my weeks are
11919500	11921500	A month in advance
11921500	11923500	At least a month in advance
11923500	11925500	For my schedules
11927500	11929500	So
11933500	11935500	So
11935500	11937500	Um
11937500	11939500	Definitely because it's debut week
11939500	11941500	Things are
11941500	11943500	Things are
11943500	11945500	Um
11945500	11947500	Excuse me
11949500	11951500	Things are
11951500	11953500	Going
11953500	11955500	Are
11955500	11957500	On kind of accelerate
11957500	11959500	Accelerate
11959500	11961500	So it's a bit hectic
11961500	11963500	To just establish ourselves
11967500	11969500	It's just to establish ourselves
11969500	11971500	And
11971500	11973500	To kind of
11973500	11975500	Give
11975500	11977500	Senpai's and the fans
11977500	11979500	Like
11979500	11981500	A bit of taste of what
11981500	11983500	Our contents like
11983500	11985500	If something you're interested in
11987500	11989500	And then maybe
11989500	11991500	After the first month
11991500	11993500	I think after the first month
11993500	11995500	Well
11995500	11997500	I think
11997500	11999500	After the first month
11999500	12001500	I might be granted it sooner
12001500	12003500	I'm not sure
12003500	12005500	But alternative
12005500	12007500	Websites and stuff for streaming
12007500	12009500	Might be in the works
12013500	12015500	Because
12015500	12017500	Um
12017500	12019500	Yeah, so giving ourselves a month
12019500	12021500	To get used to
12021500	12023500	Our new
12023500	12025500	Our new schedule
12025500	12027500	Our new routine
12027500	12029500	And kind of establish ourselves
12029500	12031500	On
12031500	12033500	The
12033500	12035500	On the main
12035500	12037500	Platforms first
12037500	12039500	Hmm
12039500	12041500	Hmm
12041500	12043500	So that's
12043500	12045500	Why
12045500	12047500	Things are kind of
12047500	12049500	A lot so far
12049500	12051500	I seem exhausted
12051500	12053500	It is definitely a lot
12053500	12055500	I will be slowing down
12055500	12057500	My schedule turns out I'm not slowing down that much
12057500	12059500	Apparently
12059500	12061500	I booked myself for like
12061500	12063500	Five streams
12063500	12065500	Next week
12065500	12067500	Four
12067500	12069500	When I said
12069500	12071500	I'm going to lower it down to three streams a week
12071500	12073500	That was a freaking lie
12073500	12075500	Blame myself
12077500	12079500	That was a freaking lie
12079500	12081500	I had to double check my schedule
12081500	12083500	So I might do it
12083500	12085500	Later
12087500	12089500	Maybe it's slowly
12089500	12091500	Slowly
12091500	12093500	When will my next ASMR
12093500	12095500	Spring be
12097500	12099500	Maybe next month
12099500	12101500	I have to see
12101500	12103500	I have to see because I'm like booked up
12103500	12105500	I might be able to fit something in
12105500	12107500	Um
12107500	12109500	But I'm definitely having to fix some audio stuff
12109500	12111500	Because I know that my audio is
12111500	12113500	Really quiet and I have to fix that
12113500	12115500	Darn
12115500	12117500	Darn ending screen where I blew out
12117500	12119500	Senpai's
12119500	12121500	Ears out that was my bad
12121500	12123500	Ha ha
12123500	12125500	If you need a break
12125500	12127500	We understand
12127500	12129500	I probably need at least a break
12129500	12131500	Next week. This week I'm still good
12131500	12133500	I'm still ready
12135500	12137500	I got some maros
12137500	12139500	And some comments though
12139500	12141500	That said
12141500	12143500	Actually that
12143500	12145500	They were so relaxed for the ASMR
12145500	12147500	That
12147500	12149500	They didn't even wake up from
12149500	12151500	The loud jump scare
12151500	12153500	So I was really impressed
12153500	12155500	I was like oh okay
12155500	12157500	I guess I did a good job
12157500	12159500	It was my first time
12159500	12161500	I actually
12161500	12163500	Went to IC
12163500	12165500	IC is actually very
12165500	12167500	Very familiar with ASMR
12167500	12169500	So
12169500	12171500	IC's ASMR are
12171500	12173500	Definitely something to look forward to
12175500	12177500	I see so
12177500	12179500	So
12179500	12181500	So is a
12181500	12183500	Seasoned ASMRist
12191500	12193500	So
12193500	12195500	So I definitely look forward
12195500	12197500	To IC's
12197500	12199500	Stuff I had to go
12199500	12201500	To IC kind of
12201500	12203500	Like last night
12203500	12205500	And was like
12205500	12207500	What's cupping
12211500	12213500	What's cupping
12213500	12215500	And then she explained it to me quite well
12215500	12217500	And she gave me like a very good video
12217500	12219500	On like a cupping
12219500	12221500	Example
12221500	12223500	Because the ones that I was seeing
12223500	12225500	I felt like we're
12225500	12227500	We're not quite
12227500	12229500	Right?
12229500	12231500	I guess
12235500	12237500	So
12241500	12243500	Sorry if I woke you up
12247500	12249500	So
12249500	12251500	I was trying to
12251500	12253500	Research a little bit
12253500	12255500	Because there were some triggers
12255500	12257500	I wasn't familiar with
12257500	12259500	From SMPI
12259500	12261500	SMPI's requested
12261500	12263500	So I went and I was like what does this mean
12263500	12265500	Like I'm not doing it right
12265500	12267500	So yeah
12267500	12269500	I feel like there's some SMPI's
12269500	12271500	That definitely didn't like the cupping
12271500	12273500	I tried my best based off of the instructions
12273500	12275500	From SMPI's and chat
12275500	12277500	But I know that some people didn't like it
12277500	12279500	So I guess
12279500	12281500	I'll give a warning if I do do it
12281500	12283500	Because I know some people liked it
12283500	12285500	But I know there's a good handful of people that didn't either
12293500	12295500	So
12299500	12301500	I don't know if I had
12301500	12303500	Any like unique triggers
12303500	12305500	I didn't go to the store
12305500	12307500	And I bought like
12307500	12309500	Like the globes
12309500	12311500	Because
12311500	12313500	Strani said yes use the globes
12313500	12315500	The globes are like wonderful people love it
12315500	12317500	I
12321500	12323500	And I saw near the
12323500	12325500	Near the ice globes
12325500	12327500	I remember seeing like this cool gel mask
12327500	12329500	And I was like oh
12329500	12331500	Oh gee
12331500	12333500	I wonder if that's there but it wasn't at this
12333500	12335500	At this particular store
12335500	12337500	That I went to
12337500	12339500	So I went to a
12339500	12341500	Further store away
12341500	12343500	Of SMPI's
12343500	12345500	And thankfully I drove
12345500	12347500	I drove about 30 minutes
12347500	12349500	To go to another store
12349500	12351500	To see if they had
12351500	12353500	This gel mask I saw in stock
12355500	12357500	Because I remember touching it
12357500	12359500	As a sample before and I really liked it
12359500	12361500	Because it has like a bunch of little tiny gel balls
12361500	12363500	And it feels good
12363500	12365500	And I think it's
12365500	12367500	It sounds kind of nice
12373500	12375500	So I have them right here next to me
12375500	12377500	And so I brought
12377500	12379500	Lots of stuff too
12385500	12387500	I'm a bit of a giggler
12387500	12389500	Honestly if I'm trying to suppress my giggles
12391500	12393500	It just gets worse you know
12393500	12395500	I was trying to suppress
12395500	12397500	Uh
12397500	12399500	Suppress
12399500	12401500	Um
12403500	12405500	I was like
12405500	12407500	I just kept going
12407500	12409500	It was a cycle
12409500	12411500	It was a cycle because
12411500	12413500	You know when you try not to laugh
12413500	12415500	You laugh harder right
12423500	12425500	It was definitely one of those things
12425500	12427500	Where I was like oh
12427500	12429500	I can't stop
12429500	12431500	Because I'm trying to
12431500	12433500	To make it really quiet
12433500	12435500	And like soft
12435500	12437500	But because I'm stifling it
12437500	12439500	It's
12439500	12441500	Becoming stronger
12441500	12443500	And then
12443500	12445500	Senpai started laughing
12445500	12447500	And I couldn't help but laugh
12453500	12455500	Because I got so confused
12455500	12457500	I got confused about
12457500	12459500	What was it? Nibbling
12459500	12461500	I don't remember what it was
12461500	12463500	And I
12463500	12465500	I just went
12467500	12469500	Like a feral animal
12479500	12481500	It was biting sounds
12481500	12483500	I didn't know what it was doing
12489500	12491500	I didn't know what I was doing
12491500	12493500	So I was like oh
12493500	12495500	Gnoming sounds
12495500	12497500	What did gnoming sounds sound like?
12497500	12499500	Not that
12501500	12503500	Not that
12503500	12505500	Clearly
12509500	12511500	That's just
12511500	12513500	Yeah that was my mistake
12513500	12515500	Definitely something to think about it
12515500	12517500	Hahaha
12517500	12519500	I'm learning so
12519500	12521500	I'm learning so much because
12521500	12523500	Of
12523500	12525500	What I did was
12525500	12527500	I was listening to some J.P
12527500	12529500	J.P
12529500	12531500	ASMR VTubers
12531500	12533500	To see what they did
12533500	12535500	And
12537500	12539500	I was just really confused
12539500	12541500	The entire time
12541500	12543500	And so
12543500	12545500	When I was setting up my mic
12545500	12547500	I was like the girls were
12547500	12549500	Really quiet
12549500	12551500	I set up to be
12551500	12553500	Quiet
12553500	12555500	And then
12555500	12557500	I read
12557500	12559500	Like
12561500	12563500	And then I read
12563500	12565500	When you're whispering
12565500	12567500	You should do like a reel
12569500	12571500	And so I was like
12571500	12573500	Okay okay
12573500	12575500	I'll do a reel whisper
12575500	12577500	And instead I ended up doing a stage whisper
12579500	12581500	Because I was too quiet
12581500	12583500	I'll have to fix that up
12583500	12585500	I didn't want to
12587500	12589500	I didn't want to accidentally break
12589500	12591500	Senpai's ears
12591500	12593500	Especially if there were
12593500	12595500	Those who were
12595500	12597500	Who were already settled in
12597500	12599500	And like relaxing and about to sleep
12599500	12601500	To break any
12605500	12607500	Any
12611500	12613500	Any ears from me
12613500	12615500	Messing around with the audio
12621500	12623500	Who was I watching
12623500	12625500	I wasn't
12625500	12627500	I'm aware of
12627500	12629500	I'm aware of them
12629500	12631500	Since I
12631500	12633500	Had some maro suggesting
12633500	12635500	To check them out
12635500	12637500	So I'm aware of them
12637500	12639500	Who did I watch
12647500	12649500	I was watching
12649500	12651500	Petra
12651500	12653500	Cool
12653500	12655500	Petra
12655500	12657500	I was watching Petra's
12657500	12659500	ASMRs
12663500	12665500	And I thought
12665500	12667500	Petra's audios
12667500	12669500	Were kind of
12669500	12671500	Kind of more quiet
12671500	12673500	So I decided to go with more quiet
12673500	12675500	And I matched and I did some tests before stream
12675500	12677500	So I matched
12677500	12679500	The audio and how it jumped
12679500	12681500	In OBS
12681500	12683500	Her audios
12683500	12685500	The regular volume
12685500	12687500	With my audios and they matched
12687500	12689500	And I was like okay, we're good
12689500	12691500	And turned out they don't match on stream
12691500	12693500	So that sucked
12695500	12697500	So I
12697500	12699500	Kind of copied Petra
12699500	12701500	Sorry
12703500	12705500	I suck
12705500	12707500	Yeah, I'm sorry
12707500	12709500	I copied Petra a little bit
12709500	12711500	Because I was like okay, well Petra did this stuff
12711500	12713500	And I looked at some other
12713500	12715500	ASMR tubers
12715500	12717500	Who I don't remember, but I definitely referenced
12717500	12719500	A lot of Petra's stuff
12725500	12727500	Inspired, yeah
12727500	12729500	How dare you, yeah
12729500	12731500	When I say stole
12731500	12733500	It's more like matching audio
12733500	12735500	Matching types of audio
12737500	12739500	And seeing
12739500	12741500	The audio levels were
12741500	12743500	I don't really mean that I'm stealing
12743500	12745500	Her ideas or
12745500	12747500	Her triggers
12747500	12749500	It's more like
12749500	12751500	Seeing
12751500	12753500	What the volume was like
12753500	12755500	And what the pacing was
12759500	12761500	And
12761500	12763500	How she would go between ears
12763500	12765500	And stuff
12765500	12767500	Things like that
12767500	12769500	Yeah, like watching
12769500	12771500	The gain and matching the volume
12771500	12773500	Yeah, so that's what I did
12773500	12775500	But turns out it was too quiet on stream
12775500	12777500	So I was like oh shit
12777500	12779500	Oh shit
12779500	12781500	And I didn't want to adjust it
12781500	12783500	In case I adjusted
12783500	12785500	I overcompensated
12785500	12787500	So I was really worried
12787500	12789500	About overcompensating
12795500	12797500	But yeah
12797500	12799500	What I ended up doing
12799500	12801500	Was kind of picking my own things
12801500	12803500	That I sort of liked
12803500	12805500	So I basically went to the store
12805500	12807500	Touched every single like
12807500	12809500	Products in there and I just picked the ones
12809500	12811500	That I liked the most or like I remembered
12811500	12813500	That it was in the store
12813500	12815500	And if it wasn't in that store
12815500	12817500	I just drove
12817500	12819500	Basically 30 minutes away to
12819500	12821500	To
12821500	12823500	To another store
12823500	12825500	And then
12825500	12827500	And then
12827500	12829500	Drove 30 minutes back
12829500	12831500	Just to get like
12831500	12833500	Do you have a few products?
12833500	12835500	Because I was like oh well
12835500	12837500	I liked these sounds
12837500	12839500	Or I liked these sounds personally
12839500	12841500	So that's what I was using
12841500	12843500	And then I ended up
12843500	12845500	Doing a lot of
12845500	12847500	Sempai suggestions
12847500	12849500	And requests because I was just like
12849500	12851500	Oh I don't know it
12851500	12853500	Does the store sell slime?
12853500	12855500	I was thinking about slime
12855500	12857500	But I was
12857500	12859500	Hmm
12859500	12861500	I was a little worried
12861500	12863500	Because I wanted something
12863500	12865500	To be
12865500	12867500	Um
12867500	12869500	I wasn't sure
12869500	12871500	If slime
12871500	12873500	Was a reusable
12873500	12875500	Product
12875500	12877500	Does that make sense?
12877500	12879500	I didn't know if it was a reusable product
12879500	12881500	Because
12881500	12883500	And then I also
12883500	12885500	Thought about
12885500	12887500	The whole YouTube thing
12887500	12889500	The whole YouTube things taking down channels
12889500	12891500	Usually is
12891500	12893500	Yeah I don't know though
12893500	12895500	Because it's like in a container and I was worried
12895500	12897500	Like oh what if like slime dries out and stuff
12897500	12899500	I've never really
12899500	12901500	Played with slime before
12901500	12903500	Does that make sense? Yeah I've never
12903500	12905500	Played with slime
12905500	12907500	I've never had an interest in slime
12907500	12909500	I know my friends were like
12909500	12911500	Oh my gosh I love slime
12911500	12913500	Here's like a new one that's chocolate scented
12913500	12915500	Or something and I'm like
12915500	12917500	I don't get it
12925500	12927500	But yeah I was like
12927500	12929500	Oh maybe slime
12929500	12931500	Making the squishing sound might be good
12931500	12933500	But the gel
12933500	12935500	The gel here
12935500	12937500	The squishing sound for the gel
12937500	12939500	Is
12939500	12941500	Stuck between like its little
12941500	12943500	Fabrics
12943500	12945500	So I thought that made it
12945500	12947500	Made it more
12955500	12957500	Safe?
12957500	12959500	Sorry
12961500	12963500	I was gonna say have you thought of oil massage?
12963500	12965500	I thought about it
12965500	12967500	But then I was worried that I would
12967500	12969500	I would ruin the 3DL
12975500	12977500	Cause I was like
12977500	12979500	I don't put it directly on right?
12979500	12981500	Um
12989500	12991500	I don't think I put it directly on
12991500	12993500	So I haven't really figured that out yet
12993500	12995500	I also didn't want to make a mess
12995500	12997500	Because
12997500	12999500	There's like a lot of
12999500	13001500	I have a lot of stuff here
13001500	13003500	That I don't want to get dirty
13005500	13007500	Um I didn't I ended up not going
13007500	13009500	With earpicks I do have a Japanese earpick
13009500	13011500	Uh
13011500	13013500	Because everyone does it
13015500	13017500	So I wanted to
13017500	13019500	Sort of differentiate
13019500	13021500	My first ASMR3
13021500	13023500	Just a bit
13023500	13025500	Not too much
13025500	13027500	Just a bit
13033500	13035500	So I
13035500	13037500	I don't want
13037500	13039500	I didn't want to just
13039500	13041500	Do it
13041500	13043500	To do something
13043500	13045500	Very common I suppose
13045500	13047500	Because
13047500	13049500	In my opinion when some people do
13049500	13051500	Earpicks I did not like them
13051500	13053500	I remember watching some videos going
13053500	13055500	I
13055500	13057500	No I don't like them
13057500	13059500	So because I didn't like it myself
13061500	13063500	Like I like using earpicks on myself
13063500	13065500	I'm like oh this is relaxing but if like
13065500	13067500	An audio was doing it
13067500	13069500	I'm like
13069500	13071500	Maybe not me
13073500	13075500	Maybe not that
13075500	13077500	And I was like oh everyone kind of
13077500	13079500	Does earpicks
13079500	13081500	So
13083500	13085500	So
13085500	13087500	I kind of wanted to differentiate myself
13087500	13089500	I even got the globes
13089500	13091500	The globes
13091500	13093500	Uh
13093500	13095500	Was in a different shape
13095500	13097500	So I was hoping it would make like a different
13097500	13099500	Different sound compared to what's
13099500	13101500	Rather than globes
13101500	13103500	So the globes I
13103500	13105500	Have right now
13105500	13107500	The globes I have right now are
13107500	13109500	Um
13109500	13111500	Are the bopple
13111500	13113500	End so you know normally it'll be around
13113500	13115500	Circle
13115500	13117500	It was shaped of a moon
13117500	13119500	It was a shape of a moon
13119500	13121500	So I thought it would make a unique
13121500	13123500	Sound
13123500	13125500	Can I feel like the
13125500	13127500	The bubbling sound
13127500	13129500	Uh
13129500	13131500	Made
13131500	13133500	Made
13133500	13135500	What lasted a bit longer
13135500	13137500	In these ones
13137500	13139500	Have you posed with them yet
13139500	13141500	That was the first thing I did
13141500	13143500	When I got home I was like
13143500	13145500	Moon prism power
13145500	13147500	Makeup
13149500	13151500	The first thing I did
13151500	13153500	When I opened them
13171500	13173500	That was the first thing I did
13173500	13175500	Regular orbs
13175500	13177500	Like the regular ice
13177500	13179500	Rollers uh on standby
13179500	13181500	In case
13181500	13183500	I wanted like a little bit of variety
13191500	13193500	So I do have some of that
13193500	13195500	I
13195500	13197500	Think my biggest problem was
13197500	13199500	I was worried if I placed
13199500	13201500	Down the
13201500	13203500	Items it would make a loud
13203500	13205500	You know hold on
13205500	13207500	Sound
13207500	13209500	So I was like
13209500	13211500	Oh shoot where did I put it
13213500	13215500	I just put it in my lap
13215500	13217500	Or well actually
13217500	13219500	I'm wearing kind of a hoodie
13219500	13221500	Right now because
13225500	13227500	I put it in my
13227500	13229500	In my hoodie pocket
13231500	13233500	Question mercy is it
13233500	13235500	Awkward to have viewers who are much older
13235500	13237500	Or younger than you are
13237500	13239500	Excuse me
13239500	13241500	Sorry I didn't take a sip in a while
13247500	13249500	Not
13249500	13251500	In particular
13251500	13253500	Um I do have to
13253500	13255500	Say that due to the nature
13255500	13257500	Of my company I would
13257500	13259500	Prefer
13259500	13261500	To be over 18
13263500	13265500	And if you are not over 18
13265500	13267500	This is not the stream for you
13267500	13269500	Or at least this is not the company
13269500	13271500	For you
13271500	13273500	I feel like a different company
13273500	13275500	Would
13275500	13277500	Suffice more
13283500	13285500	I don't
13285500	13287500	Have any particular differences
13287500	13289500	I don't feel
13289500	13291500	Anything in particular
13291500	13293500	Simply because
13293500	13295500	I don't know I've been an entertainer
13295500	13297500	And like
13297500	13299500	I've been an entertainer for so long
13299500	13301500	That like
13301500	13303500	You know if it's an audience of
13303500	13305500	All ages it just happens right
13313500	13315500	So like
13315500	13317500	In plays
13317500	13319500	In plays and stuff
13319500	13321500	Sometimes
13323500	13325500	Kids and people of all ages
13325500	13327500	Go to play
13327500	13329500	And so sometimes
13329500	13331500	You'll see like an old couple
13331500	13333500	Will come in and watch a play
13333500	13335500	Maybe the play is meant for like
13335500	13337500	Older teens
13337500	13339500	And you'll see like an old couple
13341500	13343500	Old couple come
13343500	13345500	And watch the play
13345500	13347500	That you're performing
13347500	13349500	And I feel like
13349500	13351500	As an entertainer age doesn't really matter
13351500	13353500	Who your audience is as long as they're entertaining
13355500	13357500	So if you are on the older side
13357500	13359500	I don't mind
13359500	13361500	Mostly because
13361500	13363500	I'm used to it
13363500	13365500	It's hard to say
13365500	13367500	It may sound strange
13367500	13369500	Yeah maybe it's not like hard to say
13369500	13371500	But it sounds strange
13371500	13373500	I'm having a wide range
13373500	13375500	Of
13379500	13381500	People watching me
13381500	13383500	In different formats
13385500	13387500	So in different mediums
13387500	13389500	So I've had people of all ages
13389500	13391500	Watch me
13393500	13395500	In movies
13395500	13397500	I've had people of all ages
13397500	13399500	Watch me in stage plays
13399500	13401500	I've had people of all ages
13401500	13403500	Watch me in like
13405500	13407500	You know like even like
13407500	13409500	Radio plays and stuff
13409500	13411500	So it's not something
13411500	13413500	That I think about
13413500	13415500	Too
13415500	13417500	Often
13417500	13419500	I don't think about age as like a restriction
13419500	13421500	Except for you know being in this company
13421500	13423500	Please be over 18
13429500	13431500	So
13435500	13437500	So things like that
13439500	13441500	So yeah
13441500	13443500	Anyone all ages are welcome
13443500	13445500	Except for under 18 you're not welcomed
13447500	13449500	Well maybe not
13449500	13451500	Not until you hit 18
13451500	13453500	Then
13453500	13455500	You're not ready for it yet
13455500	13457500	I'm trying to say this very nicely
13469500	13471500	What if I'm zero
13471500	13473500	Well
13473500	13475500	You're a very smart baby
13475500	13477500	And I think you need to be
13477500	13479500	You're too
13479500	13481500	You have too much
13481500	13483500	Linguist for a zero
13483500	13485500	You're old baby
13489500	13491500	And I think that
13491500	13493500	Maybe you're possessed
13493500	13495500	And that I would bring you to a priest
13495500	13497500	To be exercised
13497500	13499500	Hahaha
13509500	13511500	Sounds like an Amy problem
13511500	13513500	I know Amy's old
13513500	13515500	Old enough
13517500	13519500	What if I'm already at wizard's age
13519500	13521500	Like what
13521500	13523500	Like 30 30
13523500	13525500	You become a wizard
13525500	13527500	When you're like a virgin till you're 30 right
13531500	13533500	Why does that matter
13533500	13535500	Of course you're welcomed
13539500	13541500	Of course you're welcomed
13545500	13547500	Did I just reveal Amy's lollipop
13547500	13549500	No
13549500	13551500	No no
13551500	13553500	Amy's
13553500	13555500	Amy's legal
13555500	13557500	You know what
13557500	13559500	Fuck off, fuck off with that question
13559500	13561500	Screw you
13561500	13563500	Mods cussed off their testicles
13563500	13565500	Mods, odia, obliterate
13565500	13567500	Just kidding
13567500	13569500	Just get rid of that message
13581500	13583500	Hahaha
13589500	13591500	I'm just saying that
13591500	13593500	Uh yeah
13595500	13597500	To legally be a part of the lore
13597500	13599500	You must be above the age of 18
13601500	13603500	So 18 in human years
13605500	13607500	So both Amy and Icy
13607500	13609500	Meet that threshold
13611500	13613500	Or exceed it
13613500	13615500	Or not, I don't know
13615500	13617500	I don't actually know
13617500	13619500	I don't know how old Icy is
13619500	13621500	Really, but you know
13621500	13623500	By the power of strongy
13623500	13625500	Strongy had magical
13625500	13627500	Magical siren powers
13627500	13629500	And was able to tell
13629500	13631500	Be like yeah yeah yeah
13631500	13633500	Okay, you're in
13635500	13637500	So they cleared
13637500	13639500	They cleared the bar
13639500	13641500	Icy is, Icy is a polar bear
13641500	13643500	And uh
13643500	13645500	I don't know
13645500	13647500	And Amy is
13647500	13649500	Like
13649500	13651500	Basically an immortal, I guess
13661500	13663500	So I don't know
13663500	13665500	What, Amy's ages
13669500	13671500	And
13673500	13675500	Basically it's all
13675500	13677500	You know, it's all like
13677500	13679500	Everyone is at least of age
13679500	13681500	Within human years
13681500	13683500	And therefore can pay their taxes
13691500	13693500	Her age was question mark that day
13693500	13695500	If you, yeah, I don't freaking know
13695500	13697500	If I don't know
13697500	13699500	Just uh, if you're gonna ask ages
13699500	13701500	You should ask them, not me
13703500	13705500	We literally just talk about cats
13705500	13707500	And maybe we talk about our feelings
13707500	13709500	And we talk about like
13711500	13713500	You know, girly stuff
13719500	13721500	Old enough to drink, smile
13721500	13723500	Old enough to pay taxes
13723500	13725500	Who's dead
13727500	13729500	What's that
13729500	13731500	I'm about manly stuff
13731500	13733500	We leave that to
13733500	13735500	To...to you guys
13739500	13741500	I thought you guys talked about
13741500	13743500	Some demons' astronauties
13743500	13745500	Yeah, that's the plan in the future
13745500	13747500	Yeah, we talk about like
13747500	13749500	You know
13749500	13751500	Sacrifices
13751500	13758500	at the daily, at the yearly violor ritual.
13781500	13784500	Do you ever take the scissors out of your hair? Just curious.
13784500	13788500	Yeah, I do. I just think they look cool.
13788500	13791500	So they're there. They're there.
13801500	13803500	Are they functional?
13803500	13809500	Well, if they functioned completely, my ponytail would be chopped off.
13809500	13813500	So they sort of work. See, look, hold on. Let me, like, bounce a little bit.
13813500	13817500	And you can see that, like, they mostly work.
13817500	13822500	They are on a little pivot point, and they do move around,
13822500	13828500	but, like, I design them so that they don't fully cut my hair because...
13831500	13836500	I don't know. I feel like Senpai likes my ponytail, right?
13839500	13842500	Hard to tell. Can you zoom out a bit when you bounce?
13842500	13845500	You can't catch me with that.
13845500	13849500	I was, I was, we're, we're trying to go for monetization,
13849500	13852500	so I was instructed not to show a lot of skin.
13852500	13859500	Good, good try. Good try.
13859500	13864500	That's why the girls have been extra careful.
13864500	13868500	The girls have been extra careful recently.
13868500	13870500	I don't know.
13870500	13872500	I don't know.
13872500	13874500	I don't know.
13874500	13876500	I don't know.
13876500	13878500	I don't know.
13878500	13881500	Just kidding.
13884500	13886500	Because we don't want to get bonked.
13886500	13889500	It's already hard enough to try to get monetization,
13889500	13896500	so we don't want to get bonked.
13896500	13899500	Did you see Azura's bread? Yeah, I saw her bread.
13899500	13902500	I was like, oh, man, I want some toast now.
13902500	13906500	All milk toast sounds good, right?
13906500	13918940	I love the big bow. I wish we could see it bounce more, not until everything's safe
13918940	13935900	and sound. Everything's safe and sound, and then we… we still might play it safe for
13935900	13936900	a little while.
13936900	13946940	Who's your favorite out of the girls? I love everyone, but if I have to be like, you know,
13946940	13954300	I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love everyone, but in particular,
13954300	13965380	I feel like I see I want to snuggle a lot more. And she just hits my, my must protect,
13965380	13980380	you know, feelings. But like, um, but like, I love all the girls equally. I love all the
13981380	13986420	girls equally. But if I had to pick like someone who I would like, love on more, I
13986420	14001020	guess it would be Icy. Who do you love more? Icy or Senpai Senpai? Not even, not even
14001020	14008860	a question. I love my Senpai more. But that being said, I love my Senpai more, but I will
14008860	14015340	cut a Senpai down if they ever hurt any of the girls. If you hurt their feelings, if
14015340	14032420	you try to, try to make them cry, I will. Does that make sense? I, I will show tough
14032620	14047620	love to Senpai. I will show tough love to Senpai. What if I'm sparring with them? If
14047620	14057100	it's like a mutual agreement that you two are sparring, yes, sure, it's fine, but if
14057140	14063140	like, you know, you decide to do something a little mean, a little mean, a little cruel,
14063140	14074140	I definitely do not like that. I definitely would not like that. If, if like, you know,
14074140	14081500	if you start comparing someone, like, I, I don't like this particular thing is like
14081500	14089020	if someone says, oh, like so and so is better than so and so, I will, we all are very charming
14089020	14098220	in our own ways. And so, you know, some of the girls, including me, especially me, will
14098220	14106020	get hurt if someone says things like that. And I'm sure the other girls would also feel
14106020	14124620	the same way. And be very protective of each other. Well, I see it so much better than
14124620	14143500	mercy die. Thank you, mods. Can we bully you in soup? Can we bully with super chat? Of
14143500	14160580	course, like playful bullying is fine. Playful bullying is fine. But, you know, like real
14160580	14164740	bullying, like you're trying to hurt us, you're trying to be malicious, you're trying to be
14164740	14172380	rude. I do not appreciate that. And that's probably just not even like somebody who's
14172460	14182260	not even a senpai, you know, teasing. Okay, of course teasing. Okay, it's playful. Your
14182260	14198500	skirt's cute. I want to see it. Hi. No. So yeah. So yeah, senpai would never hurt their
14198500	14211020	koi and a senpai wouldn't hurt my gen mates either. So yeah, that's my thing. I'm very
14211020	14222180	protective of them. I know that due to what we do, there are some bad, bad players, bad
14222180	14231100	players who've been very rude. And I've been very, very angry and curt with some rude players.
14233820	14245140	So I don't, I don't appreciate, appreciate that. But otherwise, you know, anything's fine. I love
14245140	14258340	my girls a lot. You've already encountered rude players, of course. Sometimes they hurt a lot,
14258860	14264740	like the comments they make, sometimes they hurt a lot. You know, usually it's waters off a duck's
14264740	14273700	back, but sometimes they hurt. And other times I will just be like, fuck this motherfucker.
14275860	14284660	You guys get nasty marshmallows all the time. All the time. I think the only one who
14289700	14293860	you have to grow tough getting in the sliding line of work, of course, I know that. But there's
14293860	14302180	some days where, you know, you're not that tough, you know, you're a little bit more sensitive that
14302180	14308740	day. And, and, you know, the mean things hurt a little bit more.
14314980	14320820	So like all of us have, have gotten hate in some form, comments, morals, whatever.
14323140	14328820	And we have each other, though, we talk about it, we talk about it, and we're like, oh, you know, if,
14329460	14334820	for example, I told my gen mates, I was like, oh, there's this comment so-and-so
14334820	14340180	that someone made and it really hurt my feelings. And, you know, we, we go, oh,
14341060	14346100	go screw that guy. They go screw that guy. You are this and this and you're beautiful. And,
14346820	14352340	you know, you are great. And mommy, mommy has to reassure me all the time, too.
14358820	14365460	Mommy, mommy always, always, she's always willing to, like, repeat, repeat the love,
14366260	14370660	right? Repeat the love over and over again.
14377540	14382980	Yeah, mommy has definitely seen some nasty comments. I've seen nasty comments before,
14383940	14390740	but I guess, you know, I'm, I still have, I still have a bit of feelings, I'm still kind of new,
14390740	14400660	I'm still adjusting. So some, some comments hurt, but then some, I'm just like, yeah, you know what,
14400660	14415940	screw you. But yeah, definitely, I get very protective of the, the girls. So if someone,
14415940	14422420	someone purposely tries to, like, hurt them or make things very, like, scary for them, I will
14422420	14428660	fucking, like, I will find your IP address. I will find your IP address. I will, I will find your
14428660	14439460	mother. I will find your mother. I will send her a message. You know, that kind of thing.
14443300	14446740	But most likely the company will take care of it. VLR will take care of it.
14446740	14458420	VLR takes care of everything. So don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. But, you know,
14458420	14467140	sometimes, you know, being what we do, there's a lot of rude players. And what I have to thank
14467140	14477940	my lovely mods to who, uh, definitely works hard to, to make sure that we don't see nasty comments
14477940	14487540	either. So they're very, very kind. Does it make up for it a bit when you hear about all the ways
14487540	14494340	you help us get through our days? Yeah, it does. But you know, sometimes, yeah, it does. And it's
14494340	14502500	a good reminder. It's a good reminder of, uh, that what we're doing is, is, makes people happy.
14505620	14511780	And of course, you know, there's so much love, but sometimes one comment, you're just like, oh,
14512420	14522500	that kind of hurt a lot. But most comments, honestly, most comments are, are, like, if I have
14522500	14537140	to say, like, of all comments, about 99% of them is, fuck you, blocked. But like, maybe a vacation
14537140	14547140	of 1%, you're like, oh, okay, that one kind of hurt. That one kind of hurt. But like, um, most of the
14547140	14560900	time it's, it's, uh, it's, yeah, fuck you, whatever. Fuck you, whatever. Go back to school, kid. I don't
14560900	14570900	know. Is this, is it summer break already? Go back to school. You're too young for this.
14571140	14580020	Stroni seems to have nerves of steel. I'm sure Stroni has her moments too.
14583780	14588580	I'm sure Stroni also has her moments. She doesn't really show it, but she probably has her moments
14588580	14597140	too. After all, we're all, we're all like, you know, we're all, we're all feeling, we're all feeling beings.
14601140	14613700	Honestly, actually, I notice, I notice if it's like spring break or summer break or something,
14614500	14622100	uh, even, even when, uh, before I got into VLR, like spring break and like summer break would be like
14622900	14630580	the mass of like little, little twerps, little, little trolls trying to, trying to get, get,
14630580	14637540	get out, uh, get at you. So I just ignore. Well, it's just a time, but sometimes, I don't know,
14637540	14643300	some, some, some things are like, oh shit, that kind of hurt. Oh well.
14653060	14658820	Mercy, if you weren't in a fighting game, what would your intro call be? Screen for Mercy? Probably.
14668660	14676980	It's my tagline. It's my tagline. Wow, what are you gonna expect? It's my tagline.
14676980	14685540	So yeah, I'm just like, oh, whatever, you know, it might hurt. Today, uh, I think I'm very moody
14685540	14695620	today though. I think it was a mix of being overwhelmed by the fast growth, fast growth, uh, and the,
14695620	14705060	and the, um, and the, and the imposter syndrome that like today was something that was like
14705060	14716660	particularly like, oh, wow, okay. Oh, but when I started playing the game and bantering with
14716660	14726740	some pies, I felt much better. What would your victory line be? I'll be it.
14735380	14737540	Are you playing, nervously playing with a pen right now?
14738340	14742340	No.
14756820	14761300	No. No, why would you say that?
14767540	14779300	Oh, I didn't realize I was peeking.
14782820	14787540	And that was the box cutter. It was the, it was the box cutter. Actually, it was right there.
14787540	14791940	So I was nervously kind of playing with the box cutter. I was nervously playing with it because
14791940	14809620	I was like, oh, I was nervous about it because, you know, thinking about, I'm like, oh, I don't,
14809620	14816580	our growth was pretty fast and I, I run imposter syndrome right now and I'm full of emotions and,
14816580	14820980	but I'm still like super thankful to be here, but I'm also very, very, uh,
14824340	14828260	I'm very thankful to be here and I'm very happy, but I'm also just like overwhelmed.
14828260	14833780	I'm overwhelmed. Uh-huh. What was the most nervous situation you've ever been in?
14833780	14845780	Um, debut.
14846740	14857780	Uh-huh.
14865780	14870580	Honestly, before debut, I was curious and you blew all my expectations away as someone who
14870580	14878260	never understood the yandere. Thank you. Thank you, Senpai.
14881300	14884740	I know I'm more on the dare side of yandere.
14890500	14894020	You did say you could barely walk because your legs were shaking so much. I stood up
14894580	14899860	and then I collapsed onto the floor because my legs were jelly after, after debut.
14900580	14910660	Um, yeah, 1 to 10, how embarrassed were you to post the, the alt, alt audio?
14911700	14919300	Um, 200, 200% maybe.
14922100	14929140	You don't vomit before? I didn't vomit, but I didn't have to go to IDO meetings
14929220	14930740	a lot because I was so nervous.
14934500	14942020	Uh, I used to vomit when I was super nervous and stressed. I used to vomit.
14943380	14949540	Uh, I don't know if I told the story or if I told the girls, if I told the girls this, but
14950260	14956740	um, the first time I had my, my uh,
14961780	14967540	my, my driver's license, I threw up in the car,
14971060	14973940	in the testing car several times.
14974740	14984740	And then when I went back for the, the advanced license, it was the same, uh, driving tester
14984740	14989940	person. And they were like, oh my gosh, vomit girl, welcome back.
14998180	15002980	Did you pass? Not the first time. I had to come back the next day because I, I was too nervous.
15004100	15021380	Uh, yeah, um, I got my license when I was like 16. And then so when I went back,
15022660	15028980	when I went back for my, my license for my, my advanced license, uh,
15029380	15042500	I was round 18. So the fact that it was the same guy and he remembered me after that long, I was like,
15046020	15052180	look, oh my god, vomit girl, welcome back. I would expect, oh, this is around the time that you
15052180	15056180	would come back for the, the license, right? I was like,
15066420	15070180	not the next name that you want.
15082500	15086740	It's like vomit girl. You're not going to vomit again, are you?
15093140	15098180	Did you at least do it outside the car? No.
15112660	15121140	Oh, he tricked me though. He tricked me because he was like, okay, we're going to just do,
15123460	15126100	tell me at least there was a bag. Uh, I threw up
15129460	15137220	at the testing place, uh, before. So I threw up a lot in the toilet and then I
15137220	15139380	brought a bag with me and I threw up in the bag. Yeah.
15142660	15146580	No, no, no, it didn't get like any, anywhere. It's just, yeah.
15151140	15154580	It didn't, I didn't hit the instructor. I didn't hit the instructor.
15164020	15169540	It was in a bag, but it was like, you know, something that I had to, had to grab,
15170260	15178900	you know, but just happened. So, um, it just happened.
15181780	15186420	The driving instructor tricked me though, tricked me. I was like, okay, we're just,
15186420	15193460	we're going to just go through the route. We're going through the route that we're going to do,
15193460	15197220	that we're going to do, just relax. It's not the real task. We're just going to,
15198100	15204340	to go through the, um, you know, go through the route to familiarize yourself with it.
15204980	15209220	You know, we went through the route and he said, your path, you passed. And I was like,
15211460	15212580	you motherfucker.
15212900	15222340	So, yeah, I didn't vomit cause of
15234580	15240580	yeah. It's like you motherfucker. Thank you. And then I got my license. Yeah.
15242740	15252660	So now you can run over your Senpai if he tries to escape.
15253700	15256580	I don't even need to run over Senpai if he tries to escape.
15264660	15268980	Do you guys, does my Senpai think he was just like, oh gosh, he's coming back?
15273380	15284180	I should prepare for this. Or maybe he was just, or maybe the instructor was like, oh,
15285140	15292100	well, this is going to happen probably more times than this, this one. So we're going to have to
15292100	15307860	plan around it. I'm probably, honestly, I was probably,
15310100	15315860	I was probably a learning experience for that driving instructor. Cause I barfed.
15322420	15332740	I barfed and then, and then I was like, oh man. So yeah, now, and I'm a decent driver.
15336900	15341060	For free, I barfed for free. No, it was the cost of my sanity.
15341780	15352900	In all fairness, I could probably run on eight feet if I had to escape. My knees
15352900	15356340	aren't what they used to. Of course not. They're not what they're used to after I hit them several
15356340	15369620	times when they'll last escape.
15370180	15385220	I should have been main out of bag. Oh my gosh, Senpai. You're kind of freaky.
15387460	15390900	You're kind of freaky and I don't know how to feel about that.
15400500	15402500	I don't know how to feel about that.
15407220	15411380	Honestly, so many of your stories involve barfing that could be called the vomit girl
15411380	15415460	veiler. No, I don't want that. I don't want that title.
15419140	15424100	I don't want that title. I never realized how many, how many barf, barf stories I had.
15430580	15436340	Oh man, you're right. Oh, I gave you two barf stories.
15440420	15442660	No, I don't want that title.
15452660	15455300	I definitely do not want that title.
15460580	15466900	At least it wasn't three barf stories. I can't think of another one. These are the only two
15466900	15473700	stories that I currently remember that involve vomit in some way.
15480180	15486660	Oh no, except for, no, I had three stories. You're right. I told you three stories.
15486820	15494260	All right, about the one time where the reason why I don't drink anymore.
15494260	15497380	All right, that story. Oh, shit.
15499700	15506100	Oh, shit. That was the story I told, told on, told what day, shit.
15508420	15511780	Oh, you're right, Senpai. Oh no.
15517060	15529540	No, I don't want to be the barf girl or the barf tuber.
15534820	15544740	No, stop it, Senpai, please. Please, Senpai, stop it. I got nervous and I have allergies and
15545380	15547860	and and I have motion sickness.
15560900	15564100	I don't, oh, is there any other stories?
15565700	15571060	Oh, it's mostly involving with my allergies, my, um,
15575140	15581860	oh, don't call me Mercy, my barf, stop it.
15585220	15590020	At least you showered after you barfed, right? Did I?
15595380	15599060	I don't remember. I just remember that part.
15605380	15618900	No, it was like, that was, that was years ago. How am I going to remember that part?
15623380	15628980	I don't remember. I remember there were some days where I had such a bad allergic reaction.
15628980	15633380	I just had to go to sleep. I had to sleep on my side.
15634900	15642180	At the hospital because, because of that. Just remember it, forehead. I can't remember. I have,
15644100	15650340	do you remember? Do you remember what you did and so and so years ago, all the details?
15656180	15660740	Shut the fuck up. You're lying to me. You're lying to me. Get the shock collar.
15665700	15667700	Shock collar.
15674180	15676180	Ugh.
15677380	15679380	Ugh.
15682820	15684820	Ugh.
15686820	15690980	Honestly, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I don't, I don't particularly want
15691540	15696900	to be known as the barf vtuber. I haven't barfed on stream yet.
15698500	15707540	So I would rather not. I barfed off stream. Oh shit. No, you're right. I had, oh shit,
15707540	15715540	you're right. What I told, told senpai's about, about I got sick on the debut 2.0. That's,
15715540	15720820	oh shit. That's a fourth story. You're right. Oh no.
15732020	15735220	No, I'm starting to remember all the stories I'm telling senpai's.
15739220	15741060	Yet, I can't tell the future, okay?
15745780	15749140	It's, I'm, I'm kind of dumb.
15754100	15756260	I'm kind of dumb, man.
15760420	15765780	Ugh. The slave was not going to go away, is it? I'm so upset now. I'm, I'm,
15770420	15774420	I'm so upset. I, I, I have many feelings right now.
15776260	15790260	No, no, please, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, you know what?
15790820	15796900	Conversation over. I don't like this. I don't like, I don't like the direction. I don't like how
15796900	15802420	right senpai is right now. I am, I don't like it. I don't like it right now.
15805860	15809860	Ugh.
15813300	15816580	Stomach, stomach, stop. Cease, cease and assist.
15820020	15823460	I have a sensitive stomach, okay? I just have a lot of,
15824420	15824900	Ugh.
15828340	15836740	New topic quick, new topic quick. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
15839860	15841700	Senpai, I love you.
15845700	15846900	What are you listening to in the car?
15848340	15851300	Silence? The road?
15854180	15855860	I did have the,
15859140	15862260	yeah, dichotomy, dichotomy is the word of the day.
15866180	15871620	Now I like to work in silence. Like I said, senpai, I don't really listen to music that much.
15872420	15880500	I did listen to when, uh, I remember my car had a CD stuck in it because I had,
15881380	15881860	um,
15884500	15888340	I had, I had, uh, what was the album? Like,
15895060	15898500	I was going on a road trip and what was the album?
15898820	15911220	Daft Punk's Interstellar 555, like the album, the album that was, uh,
15912740	15915300	that was like associated with that, that one.
15916740	15923780	That one, I, I had, it was stuck. It was stuck in my car, so I just listened to it every time I trove.
15928900	15934740	I had it because, uh, there was like a road trip with me and my gal pals because we were going,
15934740	15939940	going to like, uh, some place, another town over for something I can't remember.
15941140	15947700	So, no, they're like, oh yeah, just put on some music, you know? Uh, and I was like, oh, okay,
15947700	15954740	yeah, sure. And so I, I picked up this, uh, the album. I got it from Japan, uh, from my, uh,
15954740	15958820	from a music, music and books, use music and bookstore.
15961140	15962900	Cole High, is this another fire story? No!
15964100	15970500	It just, it was just stuck in there. I couldn't take it out. There was something wrong with the,
15970500	15973780	with the CD player thing and it just wouldn't leave.
15977300	15979140	Oh, it was a book off? No, it was a,
15979540	15987940	uh, it was a, like, uh, it was, it was a local shop that was run by like, uh, this old lady and her,
15989140	15994900	and her son. Uh, but it was mostly the old lady that was there and it was, it was like,
15994900	15997780	just, uh, kind of like a little mom and pop shop.
15998500	16013620	Um, my Spotify playlist is probably just like OSTs. I've been listening to the .hack OST a
16013620	16020180	lot, like the anime one. That one's really good. Cole High doesn't know how to use a CD player.
16020180	16024980	No, it was like legitimately broken, legitimately broken. I had to bring it back into the shop
16024980	16029540	and be like, okay, my CD is stuck in there. By the way, can I get it out? And I said,
16030980	16034340	ah, shit. Yeah, well, we'll work on that too.
16040020	16045620	Oh, so you do listen to OSTs? Sometimes. I like working in silence a lot, but if I'm
16047140	16053380	trying to evoke a mood, I will, I will probably listen to an OST.
16055860	16070420	I will probably listen to the OST. So do you listen to any Nikkei OSTs? Uh, when I play Nikkei,
16070420	16074660	the, the only time I ever listen to the Nikkei OST is with a Nikkei.
16074900	16082020	So you don't like instrumentals? Uh,
16085620	16100020	no, my favorite song in, in, um, my favorite piece in the .hack OST is, uh, what was it called?
16104660	16134100	I can't remember. I can't remember the rest of the lyrics. I would remember it definitely if it was
16135660	16136660	You know.
16144660	16146660	I can't remember what it was. Is it Aura?
16152660	16156660	Oh, the world. It was called... anyway, I don't remember.
16158660	16159660	Maybe?
16165660	16167660	I can't remember. I can't remember.
16168660	16172660	It might be Aura, so yeah. That's the one I liked.
16181660	16182660	Oh, the...
16194660	16197660	But it does not mean a thing to me.
16199660	16200660	Something like that.
16205660	16207660	And Inuyasha had some great songs too.
16207660	16209660	Yeah, I remember Inuyasha.
16209660	16212660	I want to change the world.
16212660	16215660	Something something can't remember the lyrics.
16215660	16218660	That song was stuck in copyright hell.
16225660	16228660	During the ABU, you said you wanted to record some original songs.
16228660	16230660	Any hints you can give about what you've written?
16233660	16235660	Where's my phone?
16236660	16239660	Yeah, I listened to the near OST as well.
16250660	16251660	No.
16251660	16253660	It's kind of embarrassing.
16253660	16256660	But yeah, I definitely love Inuyasha. Oh my gosh!
16256660	16259660	Azura loves Inuyasha too, right?
16259660	16262660	I think we both have our weeb awakening with Inuyasha.
16267660	16270660	I remember loving Inuyasha.
16270660	16273660	I had all the DVDs until someone stole it.
16278660	16281660	What was it? I can't remember some of the lyrics.
16283660	16284660	Yeah.
16293660	16294660	Someone stole it? Yeah!
16294660	16297660	My entire DVD collection!
16297660	16299660	I was so upset!
16301660	16303660	I was so upset I cried.
16314660	16317660	I cried. I cried for days.
16317660	16320660	And I knew exactly who fucking stole it.
16320660	16322660	I know who stole it.
16322660	16326660	And that little son of a... son of a bitch...
16326660	16328660	Moved the next day!
16328660	16331660	I knew it was that little shit stain!
16337660	16340660	How did someone steal your entire DVD collection?
16340660	16343660	How did someone steal your entire DVD collection?
16350660	16352660	Did I just stole it?
16356660	16358660	It was when I was really young.
16358660	16360660	So it was this kid.
16360660	16363660	And I definitely know he fucking stole it.
16363660	16366660	Because he visited the house that day.
16366660	16368660	And I was like...
16368660	16371660	Oh yeah! I'm moving! Let's hang out!
16371660	16374660	And the next day my entire collection was gone!
16378660	16380660	That little fucking shit stain.
16380660	16382660	I'll fucking kill that little bitch.
16382660	16383660	What?
16395660	16398660	I didn't realize it was gone until like that little...
16398660	16400660	Snake...
16400660	16402660	Was gone.
16406660	16408660	Until that little snake was gone.
16408660	16411660	And then ever since then I was just like...
16411660	16415660	I don't trust anyone with my things.
16415660	16417660	Parents did nothing?
16417660	16418660	Oh they tried!
16418660	16421660	But that little shit stain moved someplace we didn't know.
16421660	16423660	Where they moved, you know?
16432660	16433660	They were just gone.
16433660	16435660	Yeah, they were gone.
16435660	16437660	Like how am I supposed to know?
16437660	16438660	Right?
16442660	16445660	So I was really upset.
16445660	16447660	I had all the movies.
16447660	16449660	I had all of it.
16449660	16451660	I was so upset.
16451660	16456660	My sister bought me all the movies.
16456660	16459660	And it wasn't cheap.
16459660	16461660	Those DVDs weren't cheap.
16467660	16470660	So I dealt with a lot of shit.
16470660	16472660	I dealt with a lot of shit.
16472660	16474660	I dealt with a lot of shit.
16476660	16479660	Like I dealt with a lot of shit as a kid so I'm really pissed.
16479660	16482660	I'm mad thinking about it all over again!
16482660	16484660	I'm getting...
16490660	16492660	I'm really upset now.
16492660	16494660	If you're on maybe start the collection again.
16494660	16496660	I don't...
16496660	16499660	I don't feel like starting the collection again.
16499660	16501660	I'm just mad.
16501660	16503660	In general, they had like...
16503660	16505660	Okay, like...
16505660	16509660	The DVDs I had would have like the limited edition cards.
16509660	16512660	And like they're the special coin.
16512660	16516660	That was so cool, like the special memento coin.
16516660	16519660	I don't sell those fucking shit anymore.
16526660	16528660	That was just really upsetting.
16529660	16530660	So upsetting.
16530660	16532660	So upsetting to this day.
16533660	16535660	If I ever find that fucking little kid again,
16535660	16538660	I'll fucking like curb stomp that little shit.
16538660	16540660	That little shit's probably an adult now.
16540660	16545660	Curb stomp, stomp him against them, whatever.
16547660	16549660	Did you like this point? No!
16555660	16557660	No, I didn't!
16560660	16563660	No, he just came by and said,
16563660	16565660	Yeah, I'm moving because we used to play
16565660	16568660	all together as a neighborhood kid.
16568660	16570660	Right?
16572660	16575660	Like all the kids in the neighborhood would just play together
16575660	16577660	and then this kid was going through
16577660	16579660	to every single fucking person's house
16579660	16581660	and was like, oh yeah, I just want to hang out a bit
16581660	16583660	because I'm moving, blah blah blah.
16583660	16585660	That little shit probably took something from everyone.
16590660	16592660	I'm still mad thinking about it.
16609660	16611660	Probably still from fucking everyone.
16611660	16615660	I know, I know some of, I know there was a family
16615660	16617660	in my neighborhood that got banned
16617660	16620700	in my neighborhood that got banned from everyone's frickin' house.
16621420	16624620	Oh, I'm still mad. I'm still mad. There's this, uh...
16625500	16627500	So, there's a house, uh...
16628700	16632700	And these kids were not exactly the greatest, and, uh...
16632940	16642780	Oh, they were- they reached an all- all time low one time when they- when for some reason, uh, Papa Mercy was like,
16642780	16644780	Okay, you know, maybe they've changed.
16645820	16649100	Maybe they've changed. Let's invite them to your birthday, and I said,
16649180	16653020	Fuck no, and then he did it anyways, and they stole my birthday presents.
16655660	16657900	It's like, fuck those kids, too.
16661100	16666140	Not like, you know, but like, I- I'd fucking, like, curb-stop them.
16672780	16675580	And... okay.
16678940	16680940	And the worst part was that...
16682780	16684780	We went to the parents.
16685900	16691100	Listen, listen. We went to the parents. Like, my mama and papa went to the parents.
16693260	16697340	And... was like, hey, your kids, they stole the presents.
16698540	16702220	And, you know, clearly they're playing with the fucking presents.
16703260	16711660	Um, you know what the audacity of the fucking parents did? They said, oh, we bought it. We bought it for them.
16724860	16726860	I was so pissed.
16733340	16735340	Mmm, I- mmm.
16736540	16739500	I think the police were called and everything, and like, the police were like,
16739500	16743660	Okay, we can't do anything about it, because you can't prove that it was like yours or something, and I was like,
16743660	16745660	Ah, your son.
16760220	16768060	And so, and so, like, I know that family is like banned completely. They are shunned in the neighborhood.
16774620	16777100	I was so upset. I was so upset.
16779260	16781260	Ugh.
16783020	16787820	I was so upset. Like, honestly, they were completely shunned. They stole- they stole from everyone.
16790860	16796620	They stole from everyone. When police got involved, like, they're like, oh, you can't prove that they did it, right? And I'm like,
16799340	16801340	The fuck you mean? I can't fucking prove it.
16804540	16810780	They still live in the neighborhood. I glare at them every once in a while.
16815740	16822540	Oh no, that was a different family. Gosh, I hate this. I hate that it was like two different families.
16822540	16824540	I
16827980	16835900	Actually, ever since then, I'm not going to lie. I had a really bad rebellious streak. Like, I was pretty much a delinquent.
16841020	16846780	Yeah, like, they would- I have like, you know, cameras and stuff now.
16846780	16854620	But I would never forgive them. I won't ever forgive them. Nothing has fucking changed.
16856540	16859260	Wait, nothing has changed? Are you talking about my delinquent self?
16870140	16875420	I think I calmed down quite a bit. I give- I give people more chances than not.
16876780	16879900	I did have a very violent streak growing up.
16883100	16892140	I did, I did, but I think I'm quite- I think I'm- I'm more lenient now, Senpai. You should be- you should be grateful for that.
16897100	16899100	Like, I was-
16901020	16905260	I was pretty ruthless back then. Pretty ruthless.
16907020	16911020	How many people did you beat up?
16917260	16919660	Let's skip that question. Let's skip that question.
16923820	16925820	Let's skip that question.
16932140	16934140	Let's skip that question.
16935100	16945100	I will say that one time, when I was doing- I was doing an exam, uh-
16945900	16956540	Somebody asked me for my name. Like, the person who sat next to me
16959820	16968700	said, um, my name. And I said my name, and they said, from- from- from so-and-so
16969580	16976300	School, and I said, huh? How do you know me? And they moved four- four fucking seats away from me. Okay?
16976300	16982300	Let's just say- let's just say that- that's enough. That's enough, okay?
16982300	16984300	Okay?
16996460	17005900	So, uh, I didn't know them. I didn't know them, but they said so-
17007180	17010060	Mercy? Mercy from so-and-so School?
17011020	17013020	Yeah?
17019580	17021580	Four seats away!
17030380	17036380	Um, what do you mean? Any advice? I was- I was very-
17037340	17045340	Honestly, I was very ruthless. I was very ruthless. I did things that I feel very- a lot of shame for.
17050860	17056380	Maybe it was scared of you to throw up on him. Oh, no. No, I didn't have that reputation.
17057580	17059580	Now I did. Thanks to this stream.
17062380	17064380	Um.
17067340	17079340	I don't think I'm personally any, uh, I don't think personally I have, like, uh, an aura of someone who's, like, violent.
17083340	17095340	But, uh, I definitely have a little bit- I- I did make a bit of a name for myself in my youth.
17097340	17105340	Because I was definitely very much delinquent. Like, yeah.
17107340	17109340	I'm not violent.
17116380	17118380	I don't have a violent aura.
17118380	17130380	I don't! I don't! I've calmed down quite a bit, Senpai. So Senpai should be thankful. I've calmed down quite a bit.
17136380	17146380	I've- I've definitely calmed down quite a bit, but I- I definitely had a delinquent day. Like,
17149340	17163340	like, thinking like the kind of, like, you know, think, like, typical Japanese, like, delinquent. Think about it like that.
17167340	17169340	Something like that.
17170300	17186300	I've changed quite a bit since then. I've definitely apologized quite a bit for back then.
17190300	17192300	Yeah.
17193260	17199260	What's the worst thing you've done? I don't want to say. I don't want to say what's the worst thing I've done.
17199260	17203260	That is, uh, nope. No, we're not gonna answer that.
17207260	17209260	I'm not gonna answer that.
17209260	17211260	Let's just say-
17215260	17219260	Let's just say that, um, it was-
17223260	17231260	No, no. Actually, I'm not even gonna hint to what it was.
17233260	17235260	Yeah, it was just Jay walking.
17245260	17249260	There are definitely things that will remind me of that moment, so I just go-
17250220	17260220	So, yeah, I feel- I feel quite a bit ashamed about that.
17261180	17281180	Oh, yeah. The crosswalk was never the same. Nope, it wasn't.
17285180	17287180	Yeah, I feel like you definitely had to put things in the past.
17287180	17291180	Yeah, yeah, I feel like that, too. That's why I'm just like, I don't want to talk about it.
17291180	17295180	I don't want to talk about it because, um-
17298140	17300140	I don't want- I'm moving on from that.
17310140	17312140	I'm moving on from that.
17313100	17319100	No, it is not something that I would probably be put to jail for.
17319100	17323100	No, no, no, no, no. Nothing- nothing that- that- that bad.
17325100	17327100	It's nothing that bad.
17329100	17331100	And nothing like, you know-
17335100	17337100	Um-
17338060	17342060	Nothing that's like FBI would be like, oh, okay, we can't find my outlawner.
17346060	17350060	But it wasn't bad morally, but it was- it would have definitely-
17354060	17356060	It would have definitely-
17361100	17366060	Let's just say it- it definitely, uh, was- was put on a record.
17368060	17370060	It was- was put on a record.
17374060	17376060	In my youth.
17376060	17378060	Yeah, let's move on.
17378060	17380060	Let's move on. Fuck it.
17388060	17392060	If there was a place I could talk about it, it would be with my closest peers.
17393020	17397020	And unfortunately, I want my best face for my senpai.
17405020	17407020	My best face for my senpais.
17423020	17431020	So, yeah. Yeah, sorry to- to like, just cut that off right there.
17439020	17442060	Sorry to cut that conversation off right there.
17442060	17444060	Like, I just- I just don't want to think about it.
17444060	17446060	Um-
17447020	17449020	Now I'm thinking about it.
17449020	17451020	Now I'm in a bad mood.
17451020	17453020	You know what?
17453020	17455020	You know what?
17455020	17457020	Let's-
17457020	17459020	Let's just take the day off right now.
17459020	17463020	I think- I think- I think I streamed quite a- quite a bit.
17465020	17467020	I think I streamed quite a bit.
17469020	17471020	Diligence?
17471980	17475980	Diligence was yesterday's cool word.
17475980	17481980	This- this today's, uh, cool word as dichotomy.
17485980	17487980	Sorry, kahai. No, it's okay.
17487980	17489980	It's- it's- it's me.
17489980	17491980	It's me for like, uh, what do you call it?
17497980	17499980	It's me for like, lingering.
17500940	17502940	Lingering on it.
17504940	17506940	Stop calling me barf girl.
17510940	17514940	I just want senpais to know that I am-
17514940	17520940	I am the- the- a much different person than I was back then.
17521900	17529900	And I want to stay in this good position.
17539900	17541900	So I love you senpai.
17541900	17543900	I love you so much.
17543900	17547900	We'll see each other again tomorrow.
17551900	17555900	And, uh, is there anything else I need to say?
17555900	17559900	Like, subscribe, leave a comment.
17561900	17565900	I forgot to say that, like, the last few streams.
17565900	17567900	I remember.
17567900	17569900	I remember Manny sounds like, oh yeah, don't forget to-
17569900	17571900	don't forget to like, say that.
17571900	17573900	And I'm like, oh, okay.
17575900	17577900	All right.
17578860	17582860	Thank you senpais.
17582860	17584860	Oh, by the way, the story before?
17584860	17586860	Forgetty Beam.
17586860	17590860	It's now forgotten out of your memory and will not be brought up again.
17590860	17592860	Got it?
17600860	17604860	I love you senpai.
17608860	17610860	Okay.
17612860	17614860	Good night.
17614860	17616860	Scream for Mercy.
17616860	17618860	I hope this isn't as loud as last time.
17618860	17620860	Let's go. Bye.
17637900	17640860	Thank you.
