10
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Oh

That was the fastest oh my gosh, there's dialogue too

12
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,600
Okay as Pharaoh in real nice the preposterous preposterous now that my brother has fallen I'm the king

Listen cold bird with or without a coordination ceremony blah blah blah. Huh, you're just nothing without our help

14
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Just try to get out of here on your own

15
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,620
Silence Garrett. We're all in the presence of the king you are to serve as majesty

16
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Wow

17
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,640
Wait the game started automatically it's a cutscene

18
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,680
Bravo fennel nice Bravo those creatures never had a chance a surprise attack within the snowstorm. Maybe they're after

19
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,320
Amanda cold bird. Maybe the demons are after the arch arch arch arch

20
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,440
The arch is a possibility

21
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,360
Do you think the arch is worth something to them Ryan?

22
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,600
What they came to get my arch

23
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,360
No cold bird do not let them take it. They'll use it for no good

24
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,520
This is going too fast for me to actually be a this

25
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,560
What a relief the arch is safe

26
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Amelia your leg

27
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,160
Ah and my nickname is supposed to be the sword princess, right?

28
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,520
Anyhow commander was the rest of the group

29
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600

30
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:45,760
Oh, is that asperilla relas? Oh, he did he did did wait just disappeared dead. Oh, who could take down a night so easily?

31
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,960
Greetings, I am the demon as ass. I'll hazard nonsense. The demons were destroyed a long time ago

32
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,520
And yet here I am right in front of you

33
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,920
But I'm afraid I simply don't have time for this nonsense. Let's get down to business

34
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,760
I am here to ask you for an object which you call the arch

35
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes by all means go ahead and take it take anything you wish just please spare my life

36
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,880
No, your majesty you must not do that

37
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
I'm sorry

38
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,840
All I can give you in return is a painless death

39
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,800
You all have to live with it. Oh, you're a funny guy, huh?

40
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
You bastard, how could you?

41
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:59,760
Garrett Amelia get ready. You must escape from Arteca Castle. Let's everyone in fill Gaia. No, what has happened here?

42
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,320
Oh God the commander I'm sure the demon took down others as well

43
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Oh

44
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,080
Hey, you're a bigger coward than I thought

45
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,280
Huh, what are you talking about? Why are you calling me a coward? You have no courage

46
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
You're probably thinking of a way to defeat the demon even now, aren't you?

47
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,080
Of course no matter how what it takes I'll kill that thing

48
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,520
So you caught throwing your life away courage

49
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,920
We will not be able to defeat them yet. I know it's hard to admit

50
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Look at your terrible wound

51
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,960
It's not as bad as yours. I'll mean I I won't hear of it

52
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,460
You think that fighting is an unbeatable enemy is courage. I don't agree with that

53
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,440
Then what do you consider the brave thing to do?

54
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,160
I hate to interrupt your tender moment run Garrett

55
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Gosh, I'm speed running this

56
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,100

57
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Open the gate. Oh Mina

58
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,040
You're the one who said wasting your life is not courage

59
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,560
We gain nothing from fighting the demon I

60
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,280
Fight to protect something important to me

61
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,480
I won't gain anything, but I will not lose anything will gain nothing from violence

62
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
But I can at least protect what's mine

63
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,680
Protecting something important is not a waste of life

64
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,680
Here I don't want to lose you

65
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,840
Nor are you open the gate. Oh, Mina. I'll fight with you

66
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Open the gate. Oh, Mina

67
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,440
You must tell the world what has happened here

68
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,320
Don't worry about me. I have no intention of dying here. I am the sword princess remember

69
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,120

Yes

88
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,020
If you're referring to the console then no, I can't hear the console good

89
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,180
First check your system settings if you don't need to change anything or after you've finished with the setup

90
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,220
Press the start button to begin the game. Let's start it anyways. I'm pretty sure I set everything up

91
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:27,420
If you set the vibration to on you can stop the vibration by pushing the R3 button while the controller is vibrating

92
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Yeah, this should be good I

93
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Saw this and I was like what the hell is this?

94
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,940
Turns out this game was supposed to have voice acting, but they took out the entirety of the voice acting

95
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Screen saver. Oh, let's do it off. Okay start

96
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
And I just left that part there

97
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
I

98
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,860
Have voices when you have can have mercy

00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:25,300
Flowers have so much to say if you listen they told me I would see everyone again girl who loves flowers

101
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,300

102
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,460
I

103
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,420

104
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,300

105
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,660
Look someone's coming speak of the devil use no, that's what I'm saying

106
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
I

107
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:09,420
Looks pretty good for an older game. That's because I'm using the retro tank on it. I work so hard for you senpai

108
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,860
I have put filters on here and

109
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,380
And it up it is upscaled

110
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,100
Let me catch my breath. It's not a pull not polite to keep a girl waiting

111
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
At last we meet again

112
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,060

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:04,180
Have one too the world has become a wasteland the beautiful green of the globe has faded gradually to brown

115
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,580
Okay, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah

116
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,660
I was gonna say so guy. Yeah, but I think it's for guy

117
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,860
People have banded together for survival uniting to fend off the harsh elements the menace menace of monsters

118
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,300
Those few who traveled the withered world seeking adventure are called wanderers a

119
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,460
Young wanderer is staying at surf village in the frontier

120
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:42,980
This is supposed to be a cat like a Western RPG though. He looks quite young. He is skilled beyond his years

121
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,620
What does the young wanderer seek traveling the world?

122
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Hey, you can finish up now

123
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,060
Thank you very much the ranch looks twice as big now that you've cleaned it I

124
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,340
Hired you through our village chief. I didn't expect you to work so hard

125
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,540
Oh, I still don't know your name. I keep calling you boy. Tell me. What's your name?

126
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:32,660
Senpai for nostalgia sake. Do you want to just keep the name that they made or did you want to rename them?

127
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,540
Keep the name

128
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
Oh, you wanted to be

129
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Yeah, we'll keep the name

130
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,820
It's flickering on my side a little bit, but that's okay

131
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,940
Okay

132
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,940
Oh

133
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Keep the name then

134
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,180
Since this is many people's childhoods, this is my first time playing wild aren't

135
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,540
I'm playing it currently on the original hardware

136
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,900
I inserted the disc and everything and I'm

137
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,740
Capturing it through a capture card and I am also upscaling it through a device called a retro tank

138
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,740
so

139
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
That it looks

140
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,060
Very upscaled and I've added some filters

141
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:48,100
So that senpai's won't get like this flickering effect that I I have a little bit, but it still looks amazing a

142
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Retro tink

143
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
Tinker like a tinkerer

144
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:05,700
Is this a jet engine ps2 yeah, I'm borrowing a friend's ps2 right now because I was testing my ps2

145
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
earlier in the week and then

146
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,380
Yesterday it just decided to stop working and would not turn on and I was

147
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,580
Oh

148
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,100
Yeah, it just it just didn't turn on

149
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,500
So I I really had to rush out and grab grab

150
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,300
Grab like borrow another one, but the issue is that I have a lot of games

151
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:55,220
I want to play on the ps2 and since I'm borrowing this ps2. That's a problem because I

152
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Have to give it back

153
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,140
Well, maybe I can buy a new one

154
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,460
But I worked really hard to get this to work because I don't think this game I

155
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
don't think it's it's

156
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,780
Available on PC. I don't think they ported it to anywhere. I

157
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,660
Don't think they ported this game to anywhere

158
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,940
Hmm, I don't think they ported it anywhere

159
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,380

00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,380

And you might not believe me but it's

171
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,340
One of my gal pals

172
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,380
Wanted to downsize things. I think she was she's trying to do like minimalism or something

173
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,020
But she basically has every single fucking like

174
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,300
Like system ever and so

175
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:10,260
She said hey, I heard you're doing streaming now. Do you want to have these I want to get rid of them quickly and so I

176
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
kind of

177
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
Adopted this entire collection

178
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
Which is insane

179
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,980
Which is fucking insane right

180
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,300
Yeah, all for free because she really wanted it

181
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
She really wanted it gone

182
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,300
How much did you get a lot? Let's just say I got a lot

183
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,700
Yeah, getting rid of it is crazy, but I feel like she just wanted it gone and like

184
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
and like

185
00:25:52,660 --> 00:26:00,020
For someone to actually use it so yeah, she was really nice to give it to me like your entire collection

186
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:09,900
To me so I have a few games here that are considered very rare and I'd like to play them with Senpai

187
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:27,220
Any Silent Hill was it just ps2 games or games from other consoles games from other consoles too like a really big collection

188
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,860
But

189
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,900
That's why I that's why I um

190
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,780
That's why I I kind of like I really treasure all these cuz like they're they're from my precious friend, right?

191
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,220
Does that make sense like all of these games are like my treasures

192
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,260
I think the only game that I bought

193
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:13,500
Got any dot-hack games I was just gonna say the only game that I bought recently are the dot-hack games

194
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,420
Are the dot-hack games one of a friend of a friend of mine a

195
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Friend of a friend of mine

196
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
Wanted to get rid of

197
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,420
Of

198
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,220
There they're like

199
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,980
PS2 games and like I was looking through the ps2 games and I saw that they had all of the dot-hack games and

200
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:50,620
They were going to get rid of the they said that they were oh they were gonna offer me

201
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,540
All four I think it was four. Yeah four of the dot-hack games. I already had two

202
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,820
But they were gonna give me all of the dot-hack game for only a hundred dollars and so I said yes, I

203
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,900
Said yes, so I would I have all of them

204
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,020
Hold on I'm gonna fix my model of it

205
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,500
Including to you I have all of them all of them

206
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,140
So

207
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,820
I'm not quite surprised because it seems like a lot of people even if they have like a really rare collection of stuff

208
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,940
They seem to just want to get rid of it quickly, you know

209
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,060
So that's when I was like oh, okay, I guess they didn't want the trouble of

210
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
Of like

211
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,540
Trying to find like a buyer or someone who would buy it for like a certain price, right?

212
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Oh

213
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,140
So yeah, I got wild arms I got I don't have

214
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:19,900
The original wild arms I have ultra cold F. I kind of want to start at the beginning

215
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,980
I have two and three and I think I have I think

216
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,180
Don't know if I have four, but I think I have five

217
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,180
So I have all of the Ohio arms

218
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,140
It was a part of the collection that my friend gave me

219
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,420
And this is my first time playing on the ps2 with

220
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,740
Everyone so this is my first time actually

221
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,420
Um

222
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
Like playing it on stream I

223
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,060
Did play it a bit. I was playing devil devil summoner

224
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:10,500
How long it would take for us to complete the series way too fucking long let's just say that it's way too fucking long

225
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,980
Oh, I thought you chose this because it was a favorite. I wanted to start from a beginning area

226
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,060
There will be no emulating here at all

227
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,020
So every game that I play that will be retro is either one that has been ported to PC or

228
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,780
It's on original hardware, okay

229
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
So

230
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,420
So we have plenty of games to go through, but there's a ball also a bunch of games

231
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
And I want to go through that our newer too

232
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,780
Okay

233
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,660
And Rudy is what I'll call you it's a good name. That's a good strong name

234
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,660
Let's hope that ps2 never dies one jinx it no jinx it knock on wood

235
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,060
You're a great guy Rudy

236
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,380
You have power and a tireless work ethic

237
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,660
Best of all you took care of my horses as though you understand their feelings

238
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,700
Why don't you stay in this village and work for us? I'm kidding. I know you're a wanderer

239
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,780
Here's the payment for your time it's not much that's all I can afford

240
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,140
Obtained keo berries time fly say hello to the village chief for me

241
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:02,260
Thank you very much for your work today. I will ask you for help again. I'm sure

242
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,540
Horse talk to horse

243
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,140
In my brain

244
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,500
Would you like to save today? Yeah, sure save here. Yeah

245
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Nice

246
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,140
Look

247
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:10,100
This village is desolate now. Well once it's sold it's sold in an effective medical

248
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:18,340
Man minute medicina. Well, I can't talk medicinal herb herb from the berry cave west of here

249
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,540
The name of the herb was holy berry amazing power to heal any wounds immediately

250
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,580
The cave was sealed by our village chief. It had become a dangerous place full of nasty monsters

251
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,060
This village will become rich someday if we can harvest holy berries again

252
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Did he say west?

253
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,700
I

254
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
Mean

255
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,820
I've worked 20 years in this village the time needed for plants to bud has been getting

256
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:06,140
Long longer year after year heard from others the same thing happened in other villages

257
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,400
Rumor that this entire world is heading towards destruction may not be a false rumor

258
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,980
Thank you for your hard work, you know about holy berries

259
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,500
Let's let them explain it to me again

260
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:36,580
That's what I thought a holy berry is very effective herb which people say grows in a cave near here

261
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,540
When used any injured person can be healed and their strengths revived if only I had a holy berry

262
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
No, it's nothing nevermind

263
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
No, tell me what's up?

264
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:56,180
My father's the strongest man around you may not look like it right now. He was injured and has to rest in home

265
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,860
It's true. He's a strong and brave man who can be any monster. That's why I want to heal his wound

266
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
I want my brave father back

267
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Oh

268
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,940
Sweet

269
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,940
Oh Rudy wait up. It's an older lady

270
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:31,100
Hello Rudy my husband is in his office over there, but you can rest upstairs first if you like yeah

271
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,820
I

272
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,020
Room upstairs has been prepared for you as usual. Please rest a while

273
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,620
I get to like it all this is so nice

274
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,380
Nice there's another room here

275
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
It's a barrel

276
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,100
I feel I feel like it does have like that wild west feel

277
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
Oh

278
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,780
Hello Rudy you seem to be settling in well

279
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,700
I understand the horses are thriving under your care

280
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,700
There must be something I can give you to show you show our gratitude

281
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,740
Hmm

282
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,180
The world is decaying Rudy even here in surf village

283
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:49,740
Once this village benefited from the herbs we collected from the berry cave west of the village

284
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,660
That was so long. That was long ago. Give me Rudy. Sometimes an old man's mind wanders

285
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,380
In the storage area next to this room you'll find our supply of bombs

286
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:07,100
Use them to explore the berry cave. Please take them. They're worthless to the village now, but they might be useful to you

287
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,060
No, he's gonna give us bombs

288
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:28,140
Bombs give me bombs. No, that's not bomb. Oh chess. Give me obtained tool bomb

289
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,020
A bomb can set you set at your feet by pressing

290
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,020
Square after setting it and allowing time to pass and breaks items such as wooden boxes or rocks

291
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,740
Also, if you set bombs close to each other, they explode at the same time and can destroy obstacles in a wide area

292
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,740
You can set a maximum of eight bombs

293
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
so, um

294
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,740
Village chief mr. Tallam and you've got a serious problem

295
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,580
Uh, so do I get unlimited bombs or do I have to find these bombs?

296
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,060
It's all right, please continue. Tell me what happened

297
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
It's Tony

298
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,900
But I forgot which one

299
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,060
It's Tony. He broke the village ban. He went to the berry cave

300
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
What why would he do something so foolish?

301
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,380
What should we do?

302
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,780
Berry cave used to be the source of great medicinal herb now. It's just a den of monsters

303
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
I don't know what we should do

304
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:43,100
In any case keep it a secret for now. I'll explain to the villagers later. You don't want to start a panic

305
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,700
This goes for you too. You shouldn't tell anyone about Tony breaking the village man

306
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,980
You don't need anyone running off and playing hero. We need to come up with a plan

307
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,640
Yeah, the plan is me

308
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:21,580
We are the plan we are the plan we have bombs. What else do we need?

309
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,980
Would you like to save? Yeah, let's save here too

310
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,380
Oh, that's like sneaking. Okay

311
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,540
West never eat shredded wheat

312
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,780

313
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,580

315
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,780
Tony appeared to have headed for the berry cave to the west of the search village

316
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
Use the search system to find the berry cave

317
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,460
This

318
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,460
Wow

319
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,460

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,220

That's for adventures. Oh damn

324
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,260
Oh wait, am I blocking it too much?

325
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:37,260

The village chief speak with you if he has then you already know I can't believe it. Oh, Tony is all right

328
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:07,500
I'll turn my back for one second under our law all who live in surf village are prohibited from going into this cave

329
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,380
What should we do

330
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:16,620
I got it. You're not from our village, right? Therefore you are not bound by our law

331
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,620
Well, you risk your life in going to the cave. Please find Tony and bring him back to me

332
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,060

00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,700

00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:15,020
Fine I can't read sometimes it happens

339
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,900
You can now

340
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,820
Now you have one migrant seal and the encounter cancel system is available when ea ends

341
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,420
Encounter camps and me and c sense says a monster a exclamation point

342
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
Press the

343
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:39,900
Circle button when you see the point on screen to avoid a battle. It's quite useful when you're in a hurry

344
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,900
There's no escaping a battle once it starts remember that

345
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,860
When you avoid a battle your ENC gauge decreases make sure you to be careful

346
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,460
All right, all right

347
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,020
I don't care we fighting everyone

348
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,420

Baking breath, oh no, no, he's baking

351
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,460
Let him cook

352
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,100
Oh

353
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,580
My ht went back up again nice, but my bit is 60%

354
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,900
I love gun what a useful tool

355
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:02,780
Please use more gun now you go now you go

356
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,660
Goodbye you little shit

357
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,100

358
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,980
Yeah

359
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:27,900
So how many bombs do I have like unlimited, right?

360
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:40,300
Once famous the very cave is now abandoned keep an eye out for the unknown creatures that roam its dark treacherous shafts

361
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
Shafts

362
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,820
Shafts

363
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Shafts, huh?

364
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
I can get a bomb now

365
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,660
Shoot

366
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,060
No, you go

367
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,960
Bye goodbye

368
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,120
Never mind never mind you were a coward

369
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,680
I gotta revive fruit

370
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,800
So how do I put bombs down again?

371
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,080
Anyone remember how to put square, okay

372
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,360
You

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160

00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Oh

377
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,640
Goat

378
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
Yeah

379
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,120
Those bombs won't hurt you if you're next to them. Oh

380
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
Yay, I got up to level four

381
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:40,800
I think I am getting house back after the battles

382
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Hey Betty

383
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,800
Oh, I can like okay, that's how the migrant stuff works. I'll fight you

384
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
Shoot

385
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,360
Upward

386
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:19,440
I heard the first game has like horrendous translation, which I think is probably part of its charm

387
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:35,680
In a shaft of an upward thrust in a shaft can I bomb this one?

388
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,680
No

389
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
Oh

390
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,320
More bombs and a bomb here a bomb here

391
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:05,280

392
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,600
Oh nice gave you like a cool animation and stuff

393
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,640
I happened to my other bomb

394
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,640
And a nice bomb that came out

395
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
Oh

396
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
Yes shot

397
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240

We love gun

400
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
What's this

401
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,640
Glimmering crystal spirit when you pick up orange gems your bit gauge replenishes by 10%

402
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,600
Um

403
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
Never mind no bomb

404
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,960
I want gun to work all the time

405
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:58,960
Baking breath he's cooking he's cooking me

406
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Hahaha

407
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:31,520
As an American I feel immensely close to the main character can I bomb bomb this

408
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,120
Now

409
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,040
Oops I'm stuck

410
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
I

411
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,680
Think this game is kind of based off of like the wild west in America

412
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,880
This big foxes stop trying to bake me

413
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,480
Stop cooking who let him cook

414
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,920
I think if you hold X you can sprint in the straight line

415
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,840
Oh, oh fuck

416
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,960

420
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,520
Okay, first we kill this tatsa worm

421
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,560

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880

424
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280

425
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
Inertia

426
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
Inertia

427
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,920
Is my bit important

428
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,080
Inertia I love that like um

429
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:49,520
I love that video of the the professor. She has like such a heavy accent and she goes inertia

430
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,440
It is what he's healing you after battle. Oh shit

431
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,640
I

432
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,720
Yeah, I'm gonna need bit, huh? I would like to replenish bit

433
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:38,800
Can't pull conceit mysterious cloudy gem pick up white gems to restore one unit of your ence gauge

434
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,000
I love how this is the tutorial, but where the fuck am I?

435
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,160
Oh

436
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Bam

437
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,120
Press X while next to a ladder and the character will grab the ladder

438
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,360
After you grab the ladder use the left analog stick to climb up or down

439
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,080
I

440
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,720
Want my stuff

441
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,920
Are there like lots of hidden rooms that was really hard to see

442
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,920
Oh

443
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,120

I'm obtained gimmel coin

448
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:04,240
The player can use one gimmel coin to save data even in place where there are no memory bird

449
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,960
Also, if the player loses a battle they can use a gimmel corn to choose whether they want to continue without losing stats

450
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Okay, that sounds kind of important

451
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,240
I think our button might be able to spin the camera

452
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
Oh

453
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,800

You got to work up and down the shaft seriously can't afford to get distracted when you thrust your sword

475
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,400
I have a sword. I have a gun. I'm shooting my shot

476
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:17,840
You can't succeed simply through a stroke of luck got a firmly grabs the situation at hand

477
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I

478
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,520
Sorry, I got disoriented

479
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,440
And I get I don't know another game of coin

480
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,920

Thought that was a bed. I I think it's just one of those things with like, you know a bag sand

520
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:15,440
Yes, uh, it feels like a like a like a bag

521
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:25,680
I feel so strong. I feel so powerful

522
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,160
I look like pillows those sandbags look like pillows

523
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,600
So I just assumed that it was

524
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,880
It was like a bed it looks so comfy

525
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,800
Yeah open

526
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,800
Not the master

527
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,160
Oh

528
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:35,360
It's always the nectar I remember making fun of certain games that kept on saying nectar

529
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,800
Like finding nectar shooting our shot

530
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,760
Oh, hey, it's over here

531
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,840
You cannot blame me anymore

532
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,680
You cannot blame me anymore this game is doing it on purpose

533
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,720
Was there anything on this side? I'm kind of dumb right now. I don't know where I'm going senpai

534
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,560
There wasn't anything here right no, I don't think she'll

535
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,960
No, I was like wondering if there was like something behind the bed or something

536
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,880
Oh wait, there's a sign there

537
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,920
Getting a little bit motion sickness not gonna lie. It's a bit

538
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,480
Damn, I'm really like picking butts

01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:55,440
Get out of here you little goblins literally zero

01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:25,680
I was like I can't do it. I came here sir. I came here searching for something that will heal my father's wounds

583
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,280
I came here searching for something that will heal my father's wounds

584
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,040
I heard there's some there's an herb hidden deep within this cave that can heal any injury

585
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,280
I

586
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,200
I'm stuck. I don't know what to do because that huge rock is walking my progress

587
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,840
It seems the wall would break into pieces if it receives a series of impacts

588
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,280
One two three four five

589
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,440
Oh

590
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:19,680
Did I mean big series of impacts? Oh, is it eight bombs? I thought it was five my bad

591
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,280
I thought it was five bombs. I'm so still I'm so silly

592
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,000
Is this is this the first character story you played

593
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,760
um, I booted up the game

594
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,560
And this is the first character we see

595
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,480
Yeah

596
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,600
Yeah, that's nice

597
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,640
In alter f I think they forced into Rudy's story first. Oh pretty

598
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,120
I

599
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,680
Like trees

600
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,880
We're climbing

601
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,000
Oh, I can't reach it. Yeah, I jumped

Thank you so very much

604
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:44,560
My father's gonna go die without a holy berry. He's gotta feel he's gotta get better. He's just gotta

605
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,600

01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,320
Oh

01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,440
What's going on here?

608
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:07,680
Oh, it's shaking love the uh controllers vibrating

609
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,240

What are you what is that

615
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:30,740
it's the village chief oh they brought all their little like sickles and stuff

616
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:44,660

617
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:54,740
even dog came no what are those called again they're like a little plows right

618
01:18:54,740 --> 01:19:04,900
I don't know what they're called I'm very sorry but I wanted to heal my father

619
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:08,860
that's why I had to look for a holy berry

620

01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:13,420
were all all wilted look here it is

625
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:25,460
chief chief we might be able to harvest those berries again that's the case it's

626
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:30,540
all because of Tony and Rudy to work they didn't go deep into the cave we

627
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:37,660
wouldn't know this holy berry existed in any case the most important thing is

628
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:45,540
that they came back safely let's discuss this back at the village

629
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:56,140

nice

635
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:52,540
okay that's not bad Rudy can use the force ability lock on by consuming 25

636
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:56,580
fp lock on improves the power of attacks and hits the target more accurately by

637
01:21:56,580 --> 01:22:02,060
using it with shot or cartridge however lock on while walk on his news you are

638
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:06,100
likely to get hit from your opponent depending on the situation you should

639
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:13,580
prioritize your action of attack or recovery let's walk on

640
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:21,660
oh I'm gonna just shoot I like shooting

641
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:27,380

nobody's around wait I know course

643
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:52,660
Item, force, let's force. Lock on. Let's try it.

644
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:59,660
Oh!

645
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:08,660
Drawing breath! Ewww!

646
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:17,660
Force! What's this?

647
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:27,660
Boost and shell. Right.

648
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:42,660
With this? Oh! Oh! Oh!

649
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:47,660
I should probably heal up.

650
01:23:47,660 --> 01:24:02,660
Where's my item?

651
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:14,660
Yeah, we're good.

652
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:21,660
Force.

653
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:32,660
Come on! Let's do this!

654
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:37,660
Oh!

655
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:43,660
What's going on?

656
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:57,660
That can't be good.

657
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:02,660
Oh! Oh!

658
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:08,660
Is it finished? Did we win? It kind of didn't feel like we won.

659
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:17,660
It felt like something worse was going to happen.

660
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:27,660
The dog okay?

661
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:34,660
Just amazed. It's just amazed that you beat such a huge monster.

662
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:47,660
What's the matter?

663
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:57,660
Your power. Your power might cause grave misfortune to this village.

664
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:03,660
Where's the good boy?

665
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:15,660
Is my gun? Wait, what?

666
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:22,660
Is my gun too powerful? I knew it! Your arm! The legend speak of it!

667
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:29,660
It's been forbidden here for a thousand years! Unknown holy destructive power! Damn guns!

668
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:36,660
It's an unholy destructive power.

669
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:40,660
Why do you bring such a dangerous power to our village?

670
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:46,660
It terrifies me to even think of having such a thing used in our peaceful village.

671
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:52,660
It was caused because you used the arm?

672
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:59,660
It's true. I'm convinced it's because of your arm. The monster in the cave came back to life.

673
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:12,660
No! It can't! It's not true! It can't be because he used the power! He saved me!

674
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:18,660
You may be able to see Tony, but you can't fool us any longer.

675
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:29,660
Stop it! All of you, stop! Now is the time for Temptris' debate.

676
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:36,660
Grootie, thank you for rescuing Tony.

677
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:40,660
You have a danger you brought to our village and the carelessness used in it.

678
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:48,660
The buried cave is unacceptable. In our village, we respect peace, and a hazard like your arm is prohibited.

679
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:56,660
Under our law, you must allow us time to decide your fate in this village. Do you have any objections?

680
01:27:56,660 --> 01:28:00,660
Can I say I object?

681
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:03,660
Can I just...

682
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:09,660
But it's... I thought it was just a gun.

683
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:13,660
Can we say I object?

684
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:25,660
Object! Excuse me! Excuse me! Object!

685
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:32,660
I cannot accept your objection.

686
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:44,660
You are not from our village. You wander from place to place, but this problem concerns Surf Village.

687
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:52,660
It isn't the right thing for you to let us decide what we're going to do.

688
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:58,660
Did I have choice?

689
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:05,660
Did I have choice? Is it just going to repeat the same thing?

690
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:13,660
Alright, let's object again everyone.

691
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:23,660
Man, I'll accept your objection. You are from... not from us.

692
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:31,660
No! No! No! No! Third time's a charm!

693
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:44,660
Bruh!

694
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:52,660
Never mind! Never mind, we're not allowed to object. We're not allowed to object.

695
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:57,660
Ten pa! Ten pa! I think we have to let them decide. What do you think?

696
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:06,660
I know that you... that... that we... now we... we saved this village and we brought back the Holy Berry.

697
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:11,660
But get dammit!

698
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:17,660
Literally no choice. They bamboozled me.

699
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:25,660
I'm glad you respect my decision. I will do my best to reach a verdict that everyone can agree on.

700
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:31,660
I will go back to Surf Village now. I cannot make a decision here.

701
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:37,660
I'm about to bomb your entire village right now.

702
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:44,660
The dog's alive!

703
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:48,660
Where are we saved?

704
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:53,660
He used his power to protect people fear and avoid him.

705
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:57,660
He didn't want such a power, but this destructive might of... is his.

706
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:05,660
Blah blah blah. Unaware of his inherent strength, he wanders to the wasteland searching his places in the world.

707
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:09,660
Wow, that was way too fast.

708
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:14,660
Now I can't get to save? Thank you.

709
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:27,660
Prologue 2. Treasure Hunter. Press X button.

710
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:32,660
Oh.

711
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:37,660
What a nice tune.

712
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:41,660
Is that Gattle Wand?

713
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:45,660
Huh.

714
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:50,660
Oh, it's a mouse! Okay.

715
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:54,660
This... these are the ruins of memory.

716
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:59,660
How much money do you pay for this information?

717
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:04,660
For the information on this dump?

718
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:08,660
It kind of looks like Gatomon, right?

719
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:12,660
Huh. What happened?

720
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:16,660
Handpan.

721
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:20,660
Huh. What handpan?

722
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:25,660
Do you know of this place?

723
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:32,660
I can't believe you don't. These ruins are rather famous. You believe someone's lying. Again.

724
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:38,660
Shut up. My gut is telling me that something good will come from this place.

725
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:45,660
Huh. This is obviously an intellectual one. I won't... I don't share your optimism.

726
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:53,660
I bet your name for this place would be the previously looted ruins of the dead.

727
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:57,660
Maybe then you wouldn't be having fun.

728
01:32:57,660 --> 01:33:02,660
Even if there is some treasure. I mean, it's total junk.

729
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:07,660
I'm sorry. What do you think of that voice?

730
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:16,660
I do not think you can find anything worth the money you paid.

731
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:22,660
If you feel that way, don't come with me.

732
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:29,660
Oh, don't be so stubborn. You know that you'll need my help.

733
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:36,660
Like Nyantaro? I don't know what you're talking about. Nyantaro is totally different.

734
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:43,660
At any rate, we came this far. We should at least check it out.

735
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:48,660
I might find a clue about absolute power.

736
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:54,660
Absolute power and absolute destiny. I don't know.

737
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:13,660
What's this? It's a computer!

738
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:27,660
Hey, hantan, what is this?

739
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:33,660
No! No! No! Don't touch it!

740
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:40,660
Let me handle it. It should be treated well like this.

741
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:48,660
If you are the successor of memory, enter the correct descendants name and the way will be open.

742
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:53,660
Hmm, interesting. Is it asking us to enter a name?

743
01:34:53,660 --> 01:35:01,660
Oh, shh. Maybe it is like the Nyantaro. Give me a second.

744
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:08,660
Uh, name is an important thing. Do you know the name intellectual one?

745
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:11,660
Don't get smirking me. I don't know it.

746
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:16,660
Alright. Well then, let's try it. Let's enter my name.

747
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:29,660
Okay, let's enter Jack. We're keeping the original names. Senpai.

748
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:35,660
Jack. No name matches.

749
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:46,660
He does look like a Jack. Do I look like a Mercy Senpai?

750
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:55,660
Well, I didn't really expect it. Why did I go back to my saloon accent?

751
01:35:55,660 --> 01:36:02,660
Yes, I do look like a Mercy. I look like a cutie.

752
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:07,660
Smooth.

753
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:20,660
You look more like a Kohai than me. Oh, you look like a Senpai.

754
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:32,660
I wonder, um, guy? Senpais? Do you think if we entered some name here, the way would be open?

755
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:41,660
It would just be like a quick run? I don't know. What do you think?

756
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:51,660
Like, would it? Would it? Does it? No. Man.

757
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:59,660
Not the first time at least. Okay.

758
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:07,660
Since I don't, since I did not expect my name could be the password, I don't feel next.

759
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:17,660
I could try the Konami code.

760
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:27,660
Why are you done? There was a camp. An earthquake. You must be kidding me.

761
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:32,660
You know, I'm not going to lie to you. These, like, 3D models? Whoa!

762
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:37,660
I feel like I was in Mario for a second there.

763
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:48,660
Jack Van Bra. Brace. Master of the Sword. A tireless treasure hunter.

764
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:53,660
Apan is a windmouse.

765
01:37:53,660 --> 01:38:02,660
His weapon is knowledge. His attitude is a fly in the ointment. Attitude? Yeah.

766
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:08,660
Whenever a danger awaits them, treasure hunters live for danger and thrive exploring ancient ruins.

767
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:14,660
Oh, he's Indiana Jones, got it.

768
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:20,660
Sorry, I'm going to look at the screen some more so I don't miss any text.

769
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:28,660
The treasure that Jack seeks is power with rises above all existence.

770
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:34,660
It is absolute power.

771
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:39,660
Where is it located?

772
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:44,660
The Dark Sword? The sealed magical power.

773
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:53,660
He searches earnestly. Unaware what it is.

774
01:38:53,660 --> 01:39:04,660
Jack dreams of power. He dodges traps in the ancient ruins.

775
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:25,660
I was going to say, I really like the 3D models that they did.

776
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:30,660
Oh, what's this?

777
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:39,660
Oh, shit.

778
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:45,660
Since I learned force a little bit, can I do a special speed thing?

779
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:52,660
Balloon applesauce. Balloon?

780
01:39:52,660 --> 01:40:04,660
Iplost? Like pipe?

781
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:12,660
Can I just attack?

782
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:23,660
It looks like a demon from SMT.

783
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:34,660
I know exactly which demon you're talking about. The one that has all the faces, right?

784
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:41,660
Really surprised to see this. Love this series. I feel like this series is a lot of people's...

785
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:48,660
Charizard.

786
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:52,660
He does look like that. He looks like that guy.

787
01:40:52,660 --> 01:41:03,660
Which is apparently an amalgamation of stuff that you can find in the abyss.

788
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:15,660
I am...

789
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:23,660
Engaging in battle is not the only way a character can lose HP. Triggering traps or releasing poison will also decrease HP.

790
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:31,660
While damage from traps and poison will not prevent a player from engaging in battle, entering a battle with low HP will make it harder to win.

791
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:39,660
If a character receives damage from traps or poison, try to recover HP quickly.

792
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:52,660
The stone pillar looks dubious. A device somewhere might make it work. Maybe those stones in the corner?

793
01:41:52,660 --> 01:42:02,660
Let me think for a second.

794
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:08,660
I do not like this.

795
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:13,660
If you hold R2, then press X harder to...

796
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:18,660
Then press X, the character will survey the surrounding areas for traps and other useful things.

797
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:24,660
Press X again while holding R2 and the character will continue searching for traps or other things in the area.

798
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:31,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

799
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:39,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

800
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:43,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

801
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:47,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

802
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:51,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

803
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:55,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

804
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:59,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

805
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:03,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

806
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:07,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

807
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:11,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

808
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:15,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

809
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:19,660
If you are stuck in the adventure, try searching around carefully. You will find an unexpected path.

810
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:23,660
I've already collected all the treasure, which can be sold, fools.

811
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:27,660
When I go to...

812
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:31,660
Do I go to Traps, Senpai?

813
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:35,660
When I go to Traps, Senpai?

814
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:39,660
When I go to Traps, Senpai?

815
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:43,660
When I go to Traps, Senpai?

816
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:47,660
When I go to Traps, Senpai?

817
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:51,660
Or do they just show you interactables?

818
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:55,660
Okay, it looks like they just show you

819
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:59,660
interactables.

820
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:07,660
Okay, so these things, they activate.

821
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:11,660
Okay, okay.

822
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:21,660
Good.

823
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:25,660
Good.

824
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:33,660
Good.

825
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:37,660
Good.

826
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:41,660
Good.

827
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:45,660
Good.

828
01:44:45,660 --> 01:45:03,100
Oh, okay. So those cards can be interacted with. So, how do I interact with them then?

829
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:04,780
Do I use...

830
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:09,660
Sorry.

831
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:19,020
Give me a moment to get used to the controls and stuff.

832
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:40,140
Oh, you're so loud!

833
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:44,540
No?

834
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:55,580
Okay, well, I'm gonna go over here.

835
01:45:55,580 --> 01:46:03,420
And I'm going to get my bit back.

836
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:08,860
I'm gonna go this way.

837
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:16,220
I can hop over that gap to press the switch.

838
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:19,900
Even with your long legs, I don't think you would make it.

839
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:27,100
Hampan is a windmouse. When released, he's capable of grabbing items and pressing switches.

840
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:30,380
Press the square button to release him. Hampan is nimbo and smart,

841
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:32,700
which allows him to jump over gaps without difficulty.

842
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:40,140
When Hampan is in motion, use the directional button or left analog stick to control his movements.

843
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:43,660
Oh, so can Hampan just like...

844
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:52,220
use the...

845
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:01,020
Exhaust.

846
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:04,780
No, you made me tired.

847
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:10,220
Okay, note to self, we kill this thing first.

848
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:26,220
Okay.

849
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:36,540
Well, today was a long day, Senpai.

850
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:42,540
Actually went out to the optometrist.

851
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,660
Optometrist.

852
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:52,540
And I got my eye checked again.

853
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:06,780
Can I just... hold on.

854
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:10,540
Can I have him go that way?

855
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:22,540
Oh.

856
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:32,540
Where'd he go?

857
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:36,300
Do you get a new prescription? Yeah, I haven't like...

858
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:39,340
had a prescription since like a decade.

859
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,260
Inertia.

860
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:56,940
Cost... cost a little quite a bit, but it has to be done since I'm... I'm streaming so much.

861
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:02,300
A decade, yeah, like over a decade.

862
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:10,300
Where'd he go? Where's my... where's my little rat man?

863
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:26,300
Yeah, whatever.

864
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:54,300
I think, I think it literally only works in certain places.

865
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:02,300
Oh, dizzy.

866
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:13,980
Okay, let's see.

867
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:21,100
Maybe it has to do with these locks things.

868
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:33,580
Anyways, I have to go in again because the doctor says that they are gonna do more tests on my eye

869
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:36,700
because they're worried about one of my eyes.

870
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:40,380
Taking as much one, Senpai.

871
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:49,660
I'm one under my eye patch they're worried about.

872
01:50:50,220 --> 01:51:05,740
They're worried about that... oh, can I search it? No.

873
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:21,820
Um, they think that there is a potential that there is damage to the optic nerve.

874
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:29,820
Actually, balloon first because it's it's easy to kill.

875
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:51,820
So, it's only one eye that they are very worried about.

876
01:51:52,780 --> 01:52:01,900
Because I was telling...

877
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:14,940
I was telling the optometrist, the doctor, I was like, oh, I feel like they were like looking at

878
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:20,620
my eye and they're like, huh, some things are weird with your eye. Like you're getting weird

879
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:24,940
vision that I don't think is that normal and I will go... I went...

880
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:37,420
Okay, sorry, this might take a while because brain is not puzzling.

881
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:44,380
What did you see? I just had trouble. I just kept on saying double, you know?

882
01:52:45,340 --> 01:53:00,300
Like my vision was doubling in one eye. The other eye, not so much.

883
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:14,220
So, I was like, I was explaining that in one eye,

884
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:20,140
one eye, it has a doubling effect.

885
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:22,620
Can I?

886
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:28,940
I know that I'm supposed to be like, but can I...

887
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,100
Can I like... they said I can control

888
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:42,380
the direction

889
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:47,900
of this little guy.

890
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:51,900
Ah, ah!

891
01:53:58,620 --> 01:53:59,660
I'm trying to do that.

892
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:12,860
I'm trying to see how to control my little mouse friend.

893
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:28,220
But it's really funny. It's only in one eye. The other eye is like pretty okay,

894
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:33,900
but like this eye is not doing so hot.

895
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:40,460
Was it a hold?

896
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:49,420
If I need to get surgery for it, when I go back, they'll let me know.

897
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:59,900
I don't get it. Sorry, I don't get how this little rat thing works.

898
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:16,380
Ow.

899
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:34,060
Is there another door somewhere?

900
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:39,900
Wait, what other door, Senpai?

901
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:43,820
Senpai?

902
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:50,540
He can go further if you hit the button.

903
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:57,180
Okay, it looks like he can only release at certain places.

904
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:00,140
Can you just fall down?

905
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:25,900
Well, now I know! I thought I would just hurt him.

906
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:33,020
When walking off the edge of a road or cliff, the character may pause and appear to be balancing

907
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:37,980
on the edge. This means the character can jump off, press X while balancing to jump.

908
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:47,980
If you're dashing, the character will jump without pausing first.

909
01:56:48,220 --> 01:57:07,980
Great. Good to know.

910
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:19,980
I thought I literally looked like it was not a place you can get to.

911
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:36,140
We spent so much time together and we're just like doing the prologue.

912
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:38,140
I'm so sorry, I'm so slow.

913
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:46,140
I'm so sorry, I'm so slow, Senpai.

914
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:59,020
Okay. Ow.

915
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:05,500
Root ass, bitch! I thought you were just a door.

916
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:19,020
Feel buried. Ow!

917
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:27,020
They hate me.

918
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:31,820
What is this?

919
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:39,900
To lift a box, face the box and press X.

920
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:43,660
Throw the box, face the target and press X again.

921
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:49,420
Throw the box to activate switches. Remember, throwing a box will break it in carefully.

922
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:57,020
Wow, I'm so good at this.

923
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:28,380
I hope we get to like level six or something real quick.

924
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:37,340
I'm tired of this bird.

925
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:54,380
I need a heal berry soon.

926
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:06,380
Yeah, what happened to my HP, damn?

927
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:18,380
Oh, shit.

928
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:28,940
Oh, fuck.

929
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:39,740
Ow, that hurts.

930
02:00:42,380 --> 02:00:47,740
I need the bit crystals now.

931
02:00:49,100 --> 02:01:01,580
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, look at that. We are.

932
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:15,740
It's funny, it was like we need bit crystals already healed up, leveled up.

933
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:31,740
You can exhaust me, I have nothing.

934
02:01:49,020 --> 02:02:03,740
Hmm.

935
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,740
Oops.

936
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:21,740
Was it pressing this button holding X?

937
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:27,740
Oops.

938
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:43,740
All right.

939
02:02:48,380 --> 02:03:17,740
I want to like one, one hit the like birds.

940
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:25,740
Bird. I want to one hit the birds.

941
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:34,780
Um, what was the button again to check for, for like,

942
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:40,540
I said like check for traps and I'm like, aren't these just interactables?

943
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:47,660
Son of a bitch.

944
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:51,500
I'll get your ass up.

945
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:59,900
Bird hate they make.

946
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:08,780
Oh, shit. Okay, those traps really eat at your, your thing, huh?

947
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:17,260
They really eat at the, at the health, huh?

948
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:34,060
Fuck. My bit.

949
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:49,260
Oh, it's safe.

950
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:08,860
It's safe. We're alive. They really plan these out quite well, huh?

951
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:14,380
Can someone do a little research for me?

952
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:18,220
Uh, one of my supplies, can you do a little research for me?

953
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:25,820
Is this game on the PlayStation store or is it literally just like a disc?

954
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:33,100
I know that you can buy like certain games at the PlayStation store.

955
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:42,380
But I'm not sure if this constitute says one.

956
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:48,140
And my little feature.

957
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:09,580
What the hell is this? Spikes? I hate spikes.

958
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:13,420
Pressing switches simultaneously is easy. That is all for today.

959
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:20,140
Okay, I'm going to get a box.

960
02:06:20,380 --> 02:06:32,380
Just the original PS1. Okay, so this is a real treat for some pies, huh?

961
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:44,620
Ha, ha, ha.

962
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:56,620
Why won't the other Wild Arm games?

963
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:07,900
Well, I'm so lucky. I feel, I feel very blessed to have this game that's kind of like hard to get.

964
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:19,420
Let's go. I think just one, two, and three. Okay, so there's still like four and five.

965
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:20,860
I think there's five, right? Yes.

966
02:07:23,180 --> 02:07:26,860
My bit. Kind of a beach.

967
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:32,620
Wild Arms 2 is on PSN for PS4 and PS5.

968
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,620
I forgoar.

969
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:52,620
Open up.

970
02:07:56,860 --> 02:08:24,620
I feel very lucky to share like a very rare game for some pie then.

971
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:40,620
I wonder why they didn't port this one.

972
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:56,380
My bit. It's so low.

973
02:08:57,260 --> 02:09:14,140
Fuck.

974
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:23,900
Was there an item I could carry?

975
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:31,900
Ah, I literally have to trigger it.

976
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:39,900
What the fuck?

977
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:59,900
Remember, you can run.

978
02:10:14,300 --> 02:10:27,020
Just a little bit dumb today. There's so many instructions, okay? I get so confused.

979
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:37,900
I forgoar. There's so many instructions.

980
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:43,660
Back again.

981
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:49,420
It was delayed so many times because of a bug that randomly makes part of the world map disappear.

982
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:59,660
The bug is still in the game, but if it happens, you just save somewhere normal and restart. Okay.

983
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:12,060
How much was it delayed for?

984
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:17,900
Can I just like poke here?

985
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:25,660
Really?

986
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:34,540
It's a brand new to you game. Yeah, it's a brand new game to me.

987
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:49,660
Which is why I'm taking care of all my games. Like they're my precious treasure.

988
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:10,940
Okay, so. Oh, okay.

989
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:19,580
Shit. Oh, let me adjust this.

990
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:30,300
Yes! Okay, okay. Creature. Yes, we did it.

991
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:34,860
First try.

992
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:55,340
Okay.

993
02:12:55,340 --> 02:13:09,500
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

994
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:14,980
It really does look like an SM, the SMT Chorozon.

995
02:13:14,980 --> 02:13:20,940
What level am I now?

996
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:22,220
I didn't get to see.

997
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:23,660
I'm a little dummy.

998
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:34,100
Oh, we're back here again.

999
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:35,060
Give us a second.

1000
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:40,340
You're at eight.

1001
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:41,660
That's a good level to be at.

1002
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:45,660
Yet I can't one shot hit that stupid bird.

1003
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:48,260
That stupid bird that I hate.

1004
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:50,660
Have you guys seen that video of the guy playing

1005
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:52,180
like Mario Maker?

1006
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:54,780
And then he's at the beginning of the game,

1007
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:56,980
like the title screen.

1008
02:13:56,980 --> 02:13:59,980
And he goes, and I hate the stupid bird that I hate.

1009
02:13:59,980 --> 02:14:03,140
And then he just listens to him and goes,

1010
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:05,300
the stupid bird that I hate, the stupid bird that I hate.

1011
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:20,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1012
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:22,740
That's what I'm just like thinking of right now.

1013
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:29,340
I love that video.

1014
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:29,840
Oh.

1015
02:14:35,220 --> 02:14:37,060
I remember an old video, though.

1016
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:45,820
But I feel like no, no one got their reference

1017
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:47,100
when I posted it.

1018
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:49,260
I was surprised that it was real.

1019
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:55,540
So if Sempai's, or some Sempai, that's worse.

1020
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:58,900
Accelerate.

1021
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:09,380
OK, sorry.

1022
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:11,860
If Sempai's know my alt.

1023
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:18,900
There's a post I made that I didn't realize

1024
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:19,540
it was real.

1025
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:32,700
It says over 20 pounds of, and it just reminds me,

1026
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:37,500
there was a video, or it was an audio.

1027
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:39,100
I can't remember.

1028
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:45,340
I was like, the guy literally goes over 20 pounds,

1029
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:56,780
over 20 pounds of, and I was like, oh, yeah, that meme.

1030
02:15:56,780 --> 02:16:01,380
And then I went into the store, and I was like, it's so real.

1031
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:08,380
I was surprised that it was actually real.

1032
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:32,260
It looks, I didn't, it was like in the center of the store,

1033
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:34,340
and it was like $700.

1034
02:16:34,340 --> 02:16:37,540
I was like, that's a lot of money.

1035
02:16:42,060 --> 02:16:43,460
$700, yeah.

1036
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:57,340
I think the store, kind of, what do you call it?

1037
02:16:57,340 --> 02:17:05,340
They kind of make the, oh, this is hard.

1038
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:06,340
OK, there we go.

1039
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:10,340
Yeah.

1040
02:17:16,340 --> 02:17:19,340
They kind of like, upcharge everything, I guess.

1041
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:29,340
But like, some things were OK priced.

1042
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:36,340
I was like, oh, I didn't know this lot, these stuff were so expensive.

1043
02:17:46,340 --> 02:17:55,340
20 pounds, 20 pounds, a pair.

1044
02:17:55,340 --> 02:17:59,340
I've seen only, I've only seen like, those things.

1045
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:05,340
They give me a few chances here.

1046
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:28,340
I've only seen it once in a photo where like, someone used it as a vase.

1047
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:41,340
I thought it was entertaining though, because I was like, oh, I remember this like, little voice video clip.

1048
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:47,340
Am I strong enough, I was strong enough to hit it.

1049
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:52,340
I've seen that, right?

1050
02:18:58,340 --> 02:19:01,340
We did it, we one tapped the stinking bird.

1051
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:04,340
Stinking bird that I hate.

1052
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:10,340
OK, so that's like a shortcut there.

1053
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:23,340
Stinking bird that I hate, die!

1054
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:25,340
Yeah.

1055
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:26,340
Yeah.

1056
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:42,340
You saddle, I told.

1057
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:46,340
Oh no, the Mario brain rot, huh?

1058
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:50,340
200, Gela.

1059
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:54,340
That's fine.

1060
02:19:55,340 --> 02:20:08,340
I was hoping to hear Kauai's Toad voice during the collab.

1061
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:13,340
I didn't do the Toad voice, I just, I don't think I was noticed.

1062
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:21,340
I don't think I was noticed.

1063
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:29,340
I don't think I was noticed, but then again, I was like, oh, whatever.

1064
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:32,340
They give me so much, they're so generous.

1065
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:36,340
They're giving me so much because they know I'm clumsy.

1066
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:39,340
And then I was ruined this.

1067
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:49,340
Oh yee.

1068
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:57,340
Shit.

1069
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:08,340
Don't complain, partner.

1070
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:10,340
Life is often like this.

1071
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:11,340
Let's get down.

1072
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:13,340
Let's get done with this quickly.

1073
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:22,340
Mama mia, it's a spider.

1074
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:24,340
Is that what you wanted?

1075
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,340
What?

1076
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:39,340
Check me please, I hate spiders.

1077
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:42,340
Ew!

1078
02:21:42,340 --> 02:21:43,340
Ew!

1079
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:45,340
Ew.

1080
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:54,340
I can't believe I just let that happen!

1081
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:18,340
Ew, don't, don't put your butt at me!

1082
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:20,340
Don't put your butt at me!

1083
02:22:20,340 --> 02:22:21,340
What else?

1084
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:34,340
Why are you just standing there?

1085
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:36,340
Literally, you can just move.

1086
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:38,340
I can't believe.

1087
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:46,340
I can't believe you would do that.

1088
02:22:48,340 --> 02:22:51,340
Like literally, you could just move!

1089
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:57,340
You can just move.

1090
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:02,340
Hey, you can just move.

1091
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:04,340
You can just move.

1092
02:23:04,340 --> 02:23:06,340
You can just move.

1093
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:08,340
You can just move.

1094
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:10,340
You can just move.

1095
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:16,340
I don't understand why you could just move.

1096
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:30,340
Like literally, you could just move.

1097
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:35,340
I'm gonna have to use an item like now.

1098
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:43,340
I'm gonna have to use an item like now.

1099
02:23:55,340 --> 02:23:58,340
Why can't it just move?

1100
02:23:58,340 --> 02:24:00,340
I don't understand.

1101
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:03,340
I don't understand why you could just move.

1102
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:11,340
Like it's so slow!

1103
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:19,340
Also, this is probably better lag than what people normally do.

1104
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:29,340
I don't like how they just like turn into pollution.

1105
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:32,340
I got nothing!

1106
02:24:42,340 --> 02:24:44,340
Give me that.

1107
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:52,340
What the fuck?

1108
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:54,340
Hello?

1109
02:25:00,340 --> 02:25:02,340
He?

1110
02:25:03,340 --> 02:25:05,340
What the hell is this?

1111
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:24,340
Don't touch anything.

1112
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:27,340
You need to start acting like an adult instead of a child.

1113
02:25:27,340 --> 02:25:31,340
You complain too much. Acting like a child is the secret of youth.

1114
02:25:40,340 --> 02:25:42,340
Are you just kicking?

1115
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:49,340
Hey, I'm Pan. The person in charge of this ruin is coming.

1116
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:52,340
Huh? That's an owl!

1117
02:25:52,340 --> 02:25:55,340
I don't remember the last time we saw one.

1118
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:57,340
What? What's an owl?

1119
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:58,340
You?

1120
02:25:58,340 --> 02:25:59,340
Owl?

1121
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:01,340
Owl?

1122
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:03,340
Owl?

1123
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:06,340
Owl?

1124
02:26:10,340 --> 02:26:16,340
The owl are a human-chubbed species who existed in Bulgaria long ago.

1125
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:24,340
They were a race, deep in nature, and superior to others in wisdom and magic.

1126
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:27,340
No surprise this ruin was built by you.

1127
02:26:27,340 --> 02:26:30,340
So that's Neil, huh?

1128
02:26:31,340 --> 02:26:37,340
No. This is just an image of an eel that's being predicted in light by their technology.

1129
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:42,340
This must be an EW era machine used...

1130
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:44,340
No, this is half-pan.

1131
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:49,340
The UI of this kind of reminds me of the PS1 era of SMT games.

1132
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:54,340
Well, we're playing straight up on PS2.

1133
02:26:55,340 --> 02:27:01,340
I do have a Devil Summoner and Digital Devil Saga as well.

1134
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:07,340
It's like an elf, but with a W.

1135
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:09,340
Owl?

1136
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:15,340
This must be an LL machine used to transmit information.

1137
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:21,340
They can leave anything to the agents if they leave it in the form of information.

1138
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:26,340
I see Neil now. That's a nice trick to call this place, Ruins of Memo-ing.

1139
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:35,340
Hey, Neil started to say something. No, the voice is speaking inside my head.

1140
02:27:37,340 --> 02:27:43,340
The Wild Arms Wiki claims it's pronounced LLU.

1141
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:52,340
Hello? Hello? LLU or LLU? LLU!

1142
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:56,340
No way! The voices!

1143
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:09,340
British Elf.

1144
02:28:10,340 --> 02:28:16,340
British Elf? LLU? LLU?

1145
02:28:21,340 --> 02:28:24,340
Aw, man. Just like the voices in my head.

1146
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:30,340
Do not wish for Lolithia, whom the LLU have...

1147
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:37,340
Lolithia has freezing breath, freezing palm, the power which can only be used to destroy.

1148
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:42,340
Do not wish for Lolithia, whom the LLU have set in the coffin.

1149
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:51,340
It's blowing snow, storm of death, it's tornado-leading misery, and it's absolute power to destroy everything.

1150
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:03,340
Don't be a little weirdo!

1151
02:29:04,340 --> 02:29:12,340
Is it real? Was that an LLU talking? An absolute power to destroy everything.

1152
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:17,340
Hey, Hampan. Where's Lolithia's coffin?

1153
02:29:18,340 --> 02:29:22,340
Wait, no. First off, what is Lolithia? You must know.

1154
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:29,340
Don't ask me everything at once, even with my superior wisdom. I don't know everything.

1155
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:30,340
Everything.

1156
02:29:32,340 --> 02:29:36,340
What do the voices say? Just like the voices in my head. What do the voices say?

1157
02:29:40,340 --> 02:29:41,340
Stop.

1158
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:46,340
Stopping things!

1159
02:29:46,340 --> 02:29:59,340
Ah, I see. Well, I'll do for now. Absolute power. I don't think we found a clue to its location.

1160
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:02,340
Ah, that doesn't sound like a good thing.

1161
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:07,340
Yeah, what are you going to do with this absolute power?

1162
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:12,340
Oh, you will see. Either way, I'll have to find it first.

1163
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:14,340
Ah, I don't trust you.

1164
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:18,340
Let's go and look for this Lolithia's coffin.

1165
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:31,340
Can I, like, go in here and just be like, weeee?

1166
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:36,340
It's not. Hello!

1167
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:45,340
I'm blinded by the light. I don't trust this guy.

1168
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:56,340
He looks so disappointed.

1169
02:30:56,340 --> 02:31:07,340
I really do think the 3D models they're using is pretty nice.

1170
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:12,340
What? Why does a man search for absolute power? Why? Oh, I don't know.

1171
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:19,340
Maybe to cut the binding change of the past. What will you wish for? Does he believe that absolute power will shine the light on his future?

1172
02:31:19,340 --> 02:31:25,340
Why are some of the texts so fast? A man may not realize that absolute power may exactly bind him to his unforgettable past.

1173
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:31,340
Gosh, why is the text so fast?

1174
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:42,340
You're speaking too fast. I cannot catch up.

1175
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:48,340
Go like 3, a girl at a convent. Oh, cute.

1176
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:55,340
He's going to, like, ignore the lightning warning. I don't like Jack so far.

1177
02:31:57,340 --> 02:32:04,340
Shaman. Receive my thoughts. Guardian's Shaman.

1178
02:32:16,340 --> 02:32:21,340
Are you calling? Where am I?

1179
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:26,340
I don't... I do not know this place, but I feel connected to it.

1180
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:33,340
Can you hear my thoughts, Guardian's Shaman?

1181
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:40,340
Give me your name, then the contract of old will be made once more.

1182
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:47,340
Who are you? Who's calling me? And I'm... not a Shaman.

1183
02:32:48,340 --> 02:32:51,340
Hurry, Shaman. Give me your name.

1184
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:56,340
No Gaia will be covered in darkness again. Shaman, give me your name.

1185
02:32:58,340 --> 02:33:02,340
My name is Cecilia.

1186
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:06,340
Okay. Cecilia?

1187
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:11,340
Shaman Cecilia. Release my power from the sealed library.

1188
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:15,340
Ah, fuck! Are you always going to do this to me?

1189
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:22,340
Please wait. Who are you? What do you mean by the sealed library?

1190
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:28,340
Cecilia. Oh, Cecilia. Guardian Shaman, Cecilia.

1191
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:38,340
Cecilia. Cecilia. Cecilia. Cecilia?

1192
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:42,340
Hey, Cecilia. You're so absent-minded.

1193
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:49,340
What was I doing? Is that a dream?

1194
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:55,340
On PS1, they called her Innocent One, not just Young Girl.

1195
02:33:56,340 --> 02:34:01,340
Why does this game hate eyeballs? Did you all get flashbang too?

1196
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:07,340
Were you daydreaming again? You're almost 17. You shouldn't daydream so much.

1197
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:11,340
You're so strange sometimes. Oh no, she's got chism.

1198
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:24,340
I guess I am strange, but Holly, you're strange too.

1199
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:28,340
Why are you down on your hands and knees like that?

1200
02:34:29,340 --> 02:34:34,340
Because I'm checking on you. I'm not the one who's under the table.

1201
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:37,340
Oh, that's true.

1202
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:41,340
Oh god.

1203
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:45,340
Oh god.

1204
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:57,340
Right after the bell, there was an earthquake. You really don't remember?

1205
02:34:57,340 --> 02:35:01,340
Yes. I crawled under the desk.

1206
02:35:02,340 --> 02:35:04,340
Uh, yeah.

1207
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:10,340
And I heard someone's voice. Whose voice was it calling me a shaman?

1208
02:35:16,340 --> 02:35:19,340
Hey, are you daydreaming again?

1209
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:24,340
You don't have time for that. How soon until you return to-

1210
02:35:25,340 --> 02:35:27,340
Out of hide.

1211
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:33,340
Time goes by so quickly. You're turning 17, right? You should start telling everyone goodbye.

1212
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:37,340
Goodbye?

1213
02:35:40,340 --> 02:35:44,340
If it was not a dream, whose voice was that?

1214
02:35:44,340 --> 02:35:49,340
What was that voice trying to tell me? What is this sealed library?

1215
02:35:49,340 --> 02:35:55,340
Thank you, Holly. It seems I don't have any time to waste.

1216
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:57,340
Oh.

1217
02:35:57,340 --> 02:35:59,340
Ow.

1218
02:36:05,340 --> 02:36:10,340
Why did I- I felt that. I really felt that.

1219
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:19,340
I really felt that. I was like, oh.

1220
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:23,340
I'm done with this. I'm done with this.

1221
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:28,340
Oh Cecilia, you're so absent-minded. Are you okay?

1222
02:36:28,340 --> 02:36:32,340
It's okay. She's just associating.

1223
02:36:35,340 --> 02:36:41,340
I heard your head hit the table and it was so loud. Is your head okay? Let me look at it.

1224
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:45,340
Oh no, you got a huge bump. I'm worried about you.

1225
02:36:45,340 --> 02:36:48,340
You're already pretty strange. I hope it doesn't get worse.

1226
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:54,340
I didn't forget to see Sister Mary and Mother Ange, did you? Master Ange, did you?

1227
02:36:54,340 --> 02:36:58,340
I know they were always busy, but you should go see them at some point.

1228
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:15,340
The Asian board to the person who took the lamp. Please return it!

1229
02:37:19,340 --> 02:37:23,340
Esimism is a feeling. Optimism is a decision.

1230
02:37:27,340 --> 02:37:31,340
A telescope is inoperable since it's missing the eyepiece.

1231
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:35,340
I mean the eyepiece then, huh?

1232
02:37:35,340 --> 02:37:41,340
There's a globe showing the location of stars and some related magic equipment.

1233
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:49,340
Hang on over here and look at this stuff too.

1234
02:37:49,340 --> 02:37:54,340
It's prohibited to use equipment outside of class hours. Dang it!

1235
02:38:01,340 --> 02:38:05,340
Oh!

1236
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:17,340
I guess I'll go to this side.

1237
02:38:23,340 --> 02:38:27,340
Does that lead outside? What's this?

1238
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:32,340
The stone statue is standing quietly. Quite quietly.

1239
02:38:32,340 --> 02:38:36,340
Running hard, running hard.

1240
02:38:36,340 --> 02:38:40,340
Kohai, a little, a little dumb.

1241
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:50,340
Oh Cecilia, isn't your departure day near? How are your preparations going? Do you feel ready?

1242
02:38:50,340 --> 02:38:55,340
Yes, Sister Mary. Thank you very much for all your kindness.

1243
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:58,340
There is one thing I would like to ask you about.

1244
02:38:58,340 --> 02:39:03,340
Cecilia told Mary about the mysterious dream that she had.

1245
02:39:06,340 --> 02:39:11,340
Sealed Library, Guardians Shaman. I see you had such a dream.

1246
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:14,340
Sister Mary, what should I do?

1247
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:19,340
A Sealed Library, the voice which told me, called me the Guardians Shaman.

1248
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:24,340
There's so much I don't understand. I'm so confused. Please guide me.

1249
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:31,340
It's easy to go wherever other people might direct you, but you are an adult with so much responsibility.

1250
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:34,340
And so you will have to behave like one.

1251
02:39:34,340 --> 02:39:39,340
You have to chart your own course and then face whatever may happen along the way.

1252
02:39:39,340 --> 02:39:44,340
For this reason, Cecilia, I will not give you any advice in regards to this revelation.

1253
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:46,340
You will be fine, Cecilia.

1254
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:54,340
There's nothing you cannot overcome. Just remember that all you learned at the Quran Abbey.

1255
02:39:57,340 --> 02:40:02,340
Our world, Fogaya, its title caught your attention while you read it.

1256
02:40:02,340 --> 02:40:09,340
More than 1,000 years ago, Fogaya was torn apart by a battle when alien invaders from another world.

1257
02:40:09,340 --> 02:40:14,340
All the inhabitants of Fogaya, humans, aloo and guardians,

1258
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:18,340
one by banding together and using their combined might.

1259
02:40:18,340 --> 02:40:21,340
But the price of victory came at a horrible cost.

1260
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:24,340
Aliens!

1261
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:28,340
Aliens.

1262
02:40:30,340 --> 02:40:33,340
Now you can't hunt aliens!

1263
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:36,340
You've got to use them. You've got to be real tricky.

1264
02:40:36,340 --> 02:40:42,340
I feel like every game we've been playing has some sort of aliens.

1265
02:40:44,340 --> 02:40:49,340
The world could not sustain itself without the support of the now powerless guardians.

1266
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:56,340
It was certain that gradually Fogaya would become a dry, desolate wasteland.

1267
02:40:56,340 --> 02:41:03,340
Today, no one has devised a way to stop the inevitable destruction of our world.

1268
02:41:04,340 --> 02:41:06,340
Alright.

1269
02:41:10,340 --> 02:41:12,340
Nice bed.

1270
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:18,340
Oh, that's a window.

1271
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:20,340
Sister, have you been drinking?

1272
02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:33,340
Sister, sister, sister. No better.

1273
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:46,340
That earthquake was such a shock.

1274
02:41:46,340 --> 02:41:50,340
At first I thought I was convulsing and that's why everything was shaking.

1275
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:53,340
Then I realized that my cup on the table was shaking too.

1276
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:55,340
I was so surprised I almost screamed.

1277
02:42:00,340 --> 02:42:02,340
That girl.

1278
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:11,340
Cecilia, do you mind if I tell you something?

1279
02:42:11,340 --> 02:42:15,340
I was arranging the books and noticed that a book that should be here is missing.

1280
02:42:15,340 --> 02:42:21,340
I'm irritated since it does not look good to only have the first volume of a series.

1281
02:42:21,340 --> 02:42:26,340
Look at me wrong. It has nothing to do with me caring about how the story ends.

1282
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:30,340
Anyway, if you find the next volume somewhere, will you mind bringing it back?

1283
02:42:30,340 --> 02:42:32,340
Ooh, I got an event.

1284
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:38,340
We're arranging books now. Here, take a look at this, Cecilia.

1285
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:41,340
The magic book, Della Metallica.

1286
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:46,340
Della Metallica is placed in children's literature next to Tragedy of Dolly.

1287
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:48,340
I feel unhappy more than angry.

1288
02:42:48,340 --> 02:42:55,340
I wonder if other people feel strange when they see books placed in the wrong genre or not in alphabetical order.

1289
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:57,340
Here.

1290
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:01,340
Crest you, sir.

1291
02:43:01,340 --> 02:43:04,340
This title caught your attention. Will you read it?

1292
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:09,340
An expert is able to understand a crest and use the power from it.

1293
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:11,340
It's called a crest sorcerer.

1294
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:15,340
If the expert is a female, she's called a crest sorceress.

1295
02:43:20,340 --> 02:43:24,340
Also, yes, I do feel irritated when like things are not in order.

1296
02:43:30,340 --> 02:43:32,340
Basic crest sorcery.

1297
02:43:34,340 --> 02:43:38,340
The technique of constructing magic by combining two crests is known as crest sorcery.

1298
02:43:38,340 --> 02:43:45,340
These crests enable users to cast magic without performing a large ceremony as modern style of magic dynamics.

1299
02:43:48,340 --> 02:43:50,340
Did I do basic yet?

1300
02:43:51,340 --> 02:43:53,340
Oh, I did it.

1301
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:02,340
Recommend magic, yeah.

1302
02:44:04,340 --> 02:44:07,340
When you don't have that many crests, Grah,

1303
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:11,340
make sure one of them is for HP restoring magic.

1304
02:44:12,340 --> 02:44:14,340
For there's life, there's hope.

1305
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:20,340
It's find a way out of any difficulty by staying alive under any circumstances.

1306
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:26,340
There are many useful attack magic spells as well.

1307
02:44:26,340 --> 02:44:28,340
We recommend learning fire magic.

1308
02:44:28,340 --> 02:44:34,340
Fire elemental magic is the most popular obstructive magic and will not, will often prove effective.

1309
02:44:34,340 --> 02:44:41,340
It is useful against most elemental base creatures except for light elemental monsters and undead monsters.

1310
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:57,340
I think I really recommended magic, right?

1311
02:44:57,340 --> 02:44:59,340
Della Metallica.

1312
02:45:04,340 --> 02:45:06,340
Oh, Aimee.

1313
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:10,340
Thank you for the raid, Aimee.

1314
02:45:13,340 --> 02:45:15,340
You'd romance the aliens? Yeah.

1315
02:45:15,340 --> 02:45:19,340
Hello, hello, Aimee. Welcome to the stream.

1316
02:45:19,340 --> 02:45:24,340
How's stream? Good, we're still on the prologue, but I'm reading.

1317
02:45:24,340 --> 02:45:28,340
I'm reading a lot. Welcome raiders, welcome to the stream.

1318
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:34,340
Welcome everyone, hello.

1319
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:45,340
I'm sure you know me, but my name is MercyModease from Vialorgen1 in Dolj.

1320
02:45:47,340 --> 02:45:54,340
I am currently playing Wild Arms Ultra Code F on the PS2.

1321
02:45:54,340 --> 02:46:00,340
I am literally playing it on original hardware and this is a, this is a disc.

1322
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:05,340
I am playing the game, I am playing the physical copy of the game.

1323
02:46:13,340 --> 02:46:18,340
And I am capturing it through a retro take and game capture.

1324
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:22,340
So please enjoy. Apparently this game has not been ported anywhere.

1325
02:46:22,340 --> 02:46:29,340
And so you can only play this game on original hardware. Yes.

1326
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:34,340
This is apparently a pretty rare game.

1327
02:46:34,340 --> 02:46:36,340
So please enjoy.

1328
02:46:36,340 --> 02:46:37,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1329
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:17,300
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1330
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:26,000
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1331
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:31,940
oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh holy crap it makes sense

1332
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:39,980
Wait, we're still in the prologue?

1333
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:49,660
I think we go through like all the characters, prologues first?

1334
02:47:49,660 --> 02:47:50,660
Thank you for sharing.

1335
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:51,660
I will relax and watch.

1336
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:57,220
Thank you, I mean please just relax, thank you, and I want all my supplies to relax

1337
02:47:57,220 --> 02:48:02,140
and newcomers as well, thank you.

1338
02:48:02,140 --> 02:48:06,740
Many ancient techniques are considered forbidden territory in today's world, for example planting

1339
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:14,860
life into metal.

1340
02:48:14,860 --> 02:48:21,060
If an unskilled sorcerer gained this book, the world's natural order could be overturned.

1341
02:48:21,060 --> 02:48:23,940
For that reason, I sealed this book.

1342
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:29,140
If you'd like to release the seal, tame the key of knowledge, then the essence of this

1343
02:48:29,140 --> 02:48:36,060
magic book will be revealed.

1344
02:48:36,060 --> 02:48:38,940
I think that's the same one, Della Metallica.

1345
02:48:38,940 --> 02:48:42,580
The challenge of magic, let's go.

1346
02:48:42,580 --> 02:48:46,780
It's illegal to impregnate robots in this world?

1347
02:48:46,780 --> 02:48:51,980
You're right, it is!

1348
02:48:51,980 --> 02:49:01,980
Don't be a fail, afloat, afloat, afloat, afloat, afloat, afloat, afloat, afloat, afloat!

1349
02:49:01,980 --> 02:49:05,860
If you construct magic by mistake, you can just disassemble it.

1350
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:10,100
The thing you should fear is clinging to magic you constructed.

1351
02:49:10,100 --> 02:49:15,260
Searching for new power, depending on the battle and the situation is best, have style

1352
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:16,260
and try different magic.

1353
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:25,780
Hold on, I'm going to just turn this she-you-round.

1354
02:49:25,780 --> 02:49:29,740
Elemental properties, yeah, we'll read this one.

1355
02:49:29,740 --> 02:49:33,940
Elemental properties classify the energy, flow, and characteristics of attack type magic

1356
02:49:33,940 --> 02:49:34,940
as follows.

1357
02:49:34,940 --> 02:49:42,380
Earth, water, fire, wind, ice, thunder, light, darkness, hate property classes.

1358
02:49:42,380 --> 02:49:50,500
The relation of those classes are earth, wind, water, and thunder, fire and ice, light, and

1359
02:49:50,500 --> 02:49:51,500
darkness.

1360
02:49:51,500 --> 02:49:58,660
So when using wind against earth or ice against fire, expect better results.

1361
02:49:58,660 --> 02:50:04,420
There is attack magic that is pure energy and does not belong in any class.

1362
02:50:04,420 --> 02:50:07,420
These are known as non-elementals.

1363
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:21,100
Alright, anything else, can I look at books, no, no, no, no, no other books, no books!

1364
02:50:21,100 --> 02:50:27,620
Ooh, it's spin pretty badly so I don't like it.

1365
02:50:27,620 --> 02:50:35,220
Well, let's be on the test, it better not be.

1366
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:43,900
The well is so deep that you can't see the bottom, there's only sweet smell of fresh

1367
02:50:43,900 --> 02:50:45,900
water.

1368
02:50:45,900 --> 02:50:54,500
Is that is what the device is on, which prevents the door from being opened.

1369
02:50:54,500 --> 02:51:10,260
Did you call the smell of water sweet?

1370
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:15,860
Who are we playing as right now, girl named Cecilia.

1371
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:20,140
There is attack type and support type magic, let me explain the effect of each.

1372
02:51:20,140 --> 02:51:24,900
Attack magic changes molecular movement, support magic changes molecular structure,

1373
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:26,900
messages.

1374
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:31,340
All different magic you can use are made by combining any two crests.

1375
02:51:31,340 --> 02:51:37,220
There are four types, geo, fray, wing, and muse, is that difficult to follow?

1376
02:51:37,220 --> 02:51:41,940
Anyway, you practice by creating spell.

1377
02:51:41,940 --> 02:51:45,260
Learning through trial and error is best.

1378
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:47,380
Key.

1379
02:51:47,380 --> 02:51:58,620
Below the large picture is a plaque, the portrait of the founder.

1380
02:51:58,620 --> 02:52:04,820
There's so much doors, what's behind door number one?

1381
02:52:04,820 --> 02:52:13,580
I'm not that good at magic, but I am the most talented musician at this abbey, what

1382
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:16,940
kind of music should I play today?

1383
02:52:16,940 --> 02:52:24,620
F type one.

1384
02:52:24,620 --> 02:52:34,620
Oh, it's a playlist.

1385
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:41,620
Key person.

1386
02:52:41,620 --> 02:52:46,460
Crest graph, is it the same one?

1387
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:50,980
Crest graph is a small square stone which can be imbued with magical powers.

1388
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:53,020
There are four crest types.

1389
02:52:53,020 --> 02:52:58,180
Crest sorcerers infuse a crest graph, the primary and secondary graph, crest, and the

1390
02:52:58,180 --> 02:53:00,340
two fused to form a distinct spell.

1391
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:03,340
Oh my gosh, suddenly I got so hot senpai.

1392
02:53:03,340 --> 02:53:18,340
I'm melting, melting.

1393
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:22,060
I think I have water with me.

1394
02:53:22,060 --> 02:53:26,700
Oh no, I'm going to turn off some lights, maybe it's just, maybe I'm just overheating

1395
02:53:26,700 --> 02:53:37,540
a little.

1396
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:43,580
In this fashion, sorcerers can easily carry magic with them for personal use.

1397
02:53:43,580 --> 02:53:50,500
With all the possible combination of crests, there are a total of 32 different kinds of

1398
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:53,500
magic spell available to crest sorcerers.

1399
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:54,500
Okay.

1400
02:53:54,500 --> 02:54:01,700
I wonder if the accepted will open the closet without permission.

1401
02:54:01,700 --> 02:54:03,700
Can I open it?

1402
02:54:03,700 --> 02:54:11,700
I don't have talent in terms of magic, though the Zed class the other day was fun.

1403
02:54:11,700 --> 02:54:18,060
I hit my partner with my scepter, my scepter I was covered in empty points, so the old

1404
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:20,860
saying goes better to carry a cane than to fall down.

1405
02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:29,380
When MP is about to run out, you get an idea to recover MP by using your scepter.

1406
02:54:29,380 --> 02:54:46,340
I want to open it without permission, really bad.

1407
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:48,940
I want to open it without permission.

1408
02:54:48,940 --> 02:54:56,340
Why do you need permission?

1409
02:54:56,340 --> 02:54:57,340
Inherited tears.

1410
02:54:57,340 --> 02:54:58,340
Okay.

1411
02:54:58,340 --> 02:55:10,340
A small shiny blue Pryoxy, Blue Archive, Blue Archive, I can't escape.

1412
02:55:10,340 --> 02:55:28,340
No, not the Blue Archive brain wrong.

1413
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:38,660
It's like Pryoxy, not you again.

1414
02:55:38,660 --> 02:55:53,060
They knew even in 2005 that is passed down through Outer Hyde Royalty, shaped like a

1415
02:55:53,060 --> 02:56:01,820
teardrop, it fits in the palm of one's hand, it's priceless, it blinks repeatedly with

1416
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:16,340
a fixed rhythm, like that of a heartbeat, heart beating.

1417
02:56:16,340 --> 02:56:23,460
The teardrop is passed down from generation to generation, through the females of the Outer

1418
02:56:23,460 --> 02:56:24,460
Hyde Royal family.

1419
02:56:24,460 --> 02:56:25,460
Okay.

1420
02:56:25,460 --> 02:56:37,700
So we're getting some lore.

1421
02:56:37,700 --> 02:56:38,700
Literal brain rot.

1422
02:56:38,700 --> 02:56:39,700
Am I right guys?

1423
02:56:39,700 --> 02:56:46,940
Am I right Senpai, literal brain rot happening.

1424
02:56:46,940 --> 02:56:52,980
Belief of Guardians, this title caught your attention, would you like to read it?

1425
02:56:52,980 --> 02:56:58,860
Though the Guardians have lost their power, it is rumored they once held Fogaya together

1426
02:56:58,860 --> 02:57:00,700
and still exist in this world.

1427
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:05,260
If we regard them as mere superstition, the Guardians power is the essence of life of

1428
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:07,140
Fogaya.

1429
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:13,100
This is the belief of those that praise the Guardians, and it is the belief taught here

1430
02:57:13,100 --> 02:57:23,700
at Koran, Abbey, pray to the Guardians, Earth Dragons, Earth Dragon, Rude Div, Water Turtle,

1431
02:57:23,700 --> 02:57:41,500
Skirt, Skirt Too Dark, Skirt Too Dark, Firebird, Morgalt, and Wind Tiger, Algalon, pray to them

1432
02:57:41,620 --> 02:57:43,540
and always appreciate life.

1433
02:57:43,540 --> 02:57:53,820
These are names.

1434
02:57:53,820 --> 02:57:59,460
These are names.

1435
02:57:59,460 --> 02:58:04,820
I want to go in your closet without permission.

1436
02:58:04,820 --> 02:58:05,820
Let me talk.

1437
02:58:05,820 --> 02:58:06,820
Let me talk.

1438
02:58:06,820 --> 02:58:07,820
Hello Cecilia.

1439
02:58:07,820 --> 02:58:12,740
You have good timing, I just finished the Ley Line device.

1440
02:58:12,740 --> 02:58:16,780
Device measure, the Guardians power flowing through Fogaya.

1441
02:58:16,780 --> 02:58:22,980
I should be able to observe the whole planet if it works as planned, it not only supports

1442
02:58:22,980 --> 02:58:28,700
my study about Guardians, but it might solve the mystery of Fogaya's deterioration and

1443
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:29,700
reverse the process.

1444
02:58:29,700 --> 02:58:37,700
Reverse Fogaya's deterioration, that happens many lives would be saved.

1445
02:58:38,580 --> 02:58:43,700
I will pray for the Ley Line device to help you with this.

1446
02:58:43,700 --> 02:58:48,700
But Master Ange, what do you mean by good timing?

1447
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:53,700
Oh, it's related to the teardrop that you possess.

1448
02:58:53,700 --> 02:58:58,700
I heard Sister Mary say the teardrop is a family heirling that connects girls in the

1449
02:58:58,700 --> 02:59:01,700
Adahide royal family to Guardians.

1450
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:05,700
I'd like you to observe the Ley Line device while you use the teardrop to connect with

1451
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:06,700
the Guardians mind.

1452
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:12,700
If you are successful in connecting, it might affect the Ley Line.

1453
02:59:12,700 --> 02:59:16,700
This device observes a reaction to the connection of you and a Guardian.

1454
02:59:16,700 --> 02:59:19,700
It will confirm that my device works.

1455
02:59:19,700 --> 02:59:25,700
Master Ange, I've never heard of anyone actually communicating Guardians just by

1456
02:59:25,700 --> 02:59:26,700
viewing the teardrop.

1457
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:30,700
I don't think I can meet your expectations.

1458
02:59:30,700 --> 02:59:32,700
Even if you fail, can you please try?

1459
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:34,700
I don't mind if it doesn't work.

1460
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:38,700
If it does, I'd like to see if it affects the Ley Line.

1461
02:59:38,700 --> 02:59:43,700
Understand, Master Ange, I won't give it a try.

1462
02:59:43,700 --> 02:59:48,700
During an adventure, you need to use specific items to trigger an event.

1463
02:59:48,700 --> 02:59:52,700
To use an event item, open your inventory and select items.

1464
02:59:52,700 --> 02:59:58,700
In the item menu, press R1 until you are on the event item spray page.

1465
02:59:58,700 --> 03:00:01,700
Select the item you would like to use and press X.

1466
03:00:01,700 --> 03:00:06,700
Note, you can only use the event item in specific locations.

1467
03:00:06,700 --> 03:00:07,700
So like...

1468
03:00:07,700 --> 03:00:12,700
Okay, so is this the item?

1469
03:00:12,700 --> 03:00:23,700
Okay, hold on.

1470
03:00:23,700 --> 03:00:30,700
First, I want to show...

1471
03:00:30,700 --> 03:00:37,700
Can I be used here to hang it?

1472
03:00:37,700 --> 03:00:44,700
I'm like, Kenneth, do you have this?

1473
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:55,700
Not again.

1474
03:00:55,700 --> 03:01:00,700
Shaman Cecilia, concentrate on the teardrop.

1475
03:01:00,700 --> 03:01:06,700
In the sealed library, release me from the book of Nelgau.

1476
03:01:06,700 --> 03:01:12,700
By your shaman's blood of royal descent, as one who inherits the teardrop, release me.

1477
03:01:12,700 --> 03:01:17,700
The teardrop of voice is sent directly into my heart.

1478
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:20,700
At the sealed library, release me.

1479
03:01:20,700 --> 03:01:24,700
Are you... please tell me, what can I do?

1480
03:01:24,700 --> 03:01:28,700
What does the teardrop do?

1481
03:01:28,700 --> 03:01:35,700
Cecilia, what happens to Cecilia?

1482
03:01:35,700 --> 03:01:38,700
Oh, it's alright, you're awake now.

1483
03:01:38,700 --> 03:01:44,700
First I thought you had started a daydream and then I was worried, then I realized you weren't.

1484
03:01:44,700 --> 03:01:47,700
Maybe I shouldn't have asked you to do this.

1485
03:01:47,700 --> 03:01:55,700
I'm okay, but I felt like, with the help of the teardrop, I was able to sense this mysterious voice.

1486
03:01:55,700 --> 03:01:58,700
Teardrop?

1487
03:01:58,700 --> 03:02:02,700
All of the teardrop causes the leyline observation machine to react.

1488
03:02:02,700 --> 03:02:07,700
Perhaps the teardrop you wear is tied to the leyline origins.

1489
03:02:07,700 --> 03:02:11,700
A voice you heard may be a guardian.

1490
03:02:11,700 --> 03:02:13,700
The machine observes the leylines.

1491
03:02:13,700 --> 03:02:18,700
In other words, this device may be able to sense the power of the guardians.

1492
03:02:18,700 --> 03:02:21,700
Anyway, it appears I was correct with my little experiment.

1493
03:02:21,700 --> 03:02:25,700
Thank you for operating.

1494
03:02:25,700 --> 03:02:28,700
I wonder if the...

1495
03:02:28,700 --> 03:02:31,700
Clearly they're supposed to be like the...

1496
03:02:31,700 --> 03:02:33,700
Like a...

1497
03:02:33,700 --> 03:02:36,700
Biackel...

1498
03:02:36,700 --> 03:02:40,700
What are the other guys called again?

1499
03:02:41,700 --> 03:02:47,700
Target tool is an item that automatically highlights important objects around in yellow.

1500
03:02:47,700 --> 03:02:54,700
In the party menu, you can turn the effect on or off by selecting the target tool and using it.

1501
03:02:54,700 --> 03:02:57,700
So I can just use it?

1502
03:02:57,700 --> 03:03:11,700
The four bees? Yeah, the divine...

1503
03:03:11,700 --> 03:03:14,700
Vist.

1504
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:23,700
Wait...

1505
03:03:23,700 --> 03:03:26,700
How'd I use the target tool again?

1506
03:03:26,700 --> 03:03:28,700
Yeah.

1507
03:03:38,700 --> 03:03:44,700
They had to use it again.

1508
03:03:44,700 --> 03:03:46,700
Yeah, they have the same elements.

1509
03:03:46,700 --> 03:03:49,700
Yeah, then it would be the bees and the guardians.

1510
03:03:49,700 --> 03:03:53,700
It's a square? I'm pressing square. I don't think it's square.

1511
03:03:53,700 --> 03:03:57,700
Unless it's like holding this down and looking around again, like...

1512
03:03:57,700 --> 03:04:00,700
I don't know.

1513
03:04:00,700 --> 03:04:02,700
Hill?

1514
03:04:12,700 --> 03:04:15,700
Press the select button, koai. Okay.

1515
03:04:24,700 --> 03:04:28,700
Should be right. Maybe there's nothing to interact with.

1516
03:04:34,700 --> 03:04:37,700
This makes me go.

1517
03:04:54,700 --> 03:04:58,700
She moves.

1518
03:04:58,700 --> 03:05:04,700
I'm pressing the select button. I don't think anything's happening.

1519
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:11,700
Don't run in the hallway. It's prohibited. If you were caught, you will sit in the corner.

1520
03:05:24,700 --> 03:05:31,700
See, it's library. I heard about it, but it's not a scoop.

1521
03:05:31,700 --> 03:05:35,700
I heard it's one of current Abbey's seven wonderful secrets.

1522
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:37,700
Memory's certain, right? The story is.

1523
03:05:37,700 --> 03:05:45,700
Stand before the holy woman who guards the door and raise the light of light, then the way will be opened.

1524
03:05:45,700 --> 03:05:47,700
But the story's a lie.

1525
03:05:47,700 --> 03:05:52,700
You're a lamp at the holy woman statue and it didn't show any reaction.

1526
03:05:52,700 --> 03:05:54,700
You're with a different sort of life.

1527
03:05:54,700 --> 03:05:57,700
You're the one that stole the lamp!

1528
03:06:00,700 --> 03:06:02,700
Party menu.

1529
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:06,700
Party?

1530
03:06:06,700 --> 03:06:15,700
She's cute though.

1531
03:06:15,700 --> 03:06:17,700
Look bad!

1532
03:06:23,700 --> 03:06:28,700
So, it highlights objects you can interact with if you had to turn on, but how do I turn it on?

1533
03:06:28,700 --> 03:06:31,700
Senpai, how do I turn it on?

1534
03:06:37,700 --> 03:06:42,700
Also for coins, yeah, let's open it.

1535
03:06:42,700 --> 03:06:47,700
In ancient times, Gimmel coins were a currency of El, Elu.

1536
03:06:50,700 --> 03:06:55,700
The coin have retained remnants of their magical heritage.

1537
03:06:55,700 --> 03:06:58,700
Use them at any time to save your game to your memory card.

1538
03:06:58,700 --> 03:07:00,700
Yes, too.

1539
03:07:00,700 --> 03:07:05,700
If you are defeated during battle, your Gimmel coins also function as continues.

1540
03:07:05,700 --> 03:07:12,700
However, your experience points for the next level up will be lost and the number of continues you use are recorded.

1541
03:07:12,700 --> 03:07:16,700
Make sure you use your Gimmel coins carefully.

1542
03:07:21,700 --> 03:07:24,700
How do I turn it on in my inventory?

1543
03:07:28,700 --> 03:07:30,700
Sorry!

1544
03:07:36,700 --> 03:07:41,700
Just like the instruction was like...

1545
03:07:45,700 --> 03:07:47,700
Oh, I can save here.

1546
03:07:47,700 --> 03:07:49,700
I saw a yellow...

1547
03:07:49,700 --> 03:07:51,700
Oh, like this.

1548
03:07:54,700 --> 03:07:58,700
Oh! Okay, I see it now.

1549
03:07:58,700 --> 03:08:00,700
So, so, so.

1550
03:08:00,700 --> 03:08:01,700
There we go.

1551
03:08:01,700 --> 03:08:04,700
Okay, so it's just, you just have to like walk by it.

1552
03:08:04,700 --> 03:08:09,700
Okay, it was so not visible in the other areas.

1553
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:16,700
The very existence of the legendary Elu is all but forgotten to the sands of time.

1554
03:08:16,700 --> 03:08:22,700
Elu are similar to humans in appearance except they have long ears and are covered with fur.

1555
03:08:22,700 --> 03:08:34,700
Okay, they're not elves! Elves! Furry! They're furry elves!

1556
03:08:37,700 --> 03:08:44,700
The only evidence we have of their existence comes from folklore and a few eyewitness accounts.

1557
03:08:44,700 --> 03:08:49,700
Why did the Elu who possessed such power disappear from Gaia?

1558
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:55,700
There are many theories, but the mystery remains unsolved.

1559
03:08:55,700 --> 03:08:58,700
It seems the truth has died with the Elu.

1560
03:09:04,700 --> 03:09:08,700
I'm the gardener's graze! Would you like to see my child?

1561
03:09:09,700 --> 03:09:15,700
I refuse to believe that this bird is like eloquent in any way.

1562
03:09:20,700 --> 03:09:26,700
I think the Elu are extinct, yes.

1563
03:09:34,700 --> 03:09:39,700
You have some fried up chow mein. Try this since you are here.

1564
03:09:40,700 --> 03:09:46,700
You ate the chow mein. It was such gusto.

1565
03:09:46,700 --> 03:09:49,700
You ate the chow mein with such gusto.

1566
03:09:49,700 --> 03:09:53,700
I love it when people enjoy the food I made. Come back any time you're hungry.

1567
03:09:53,700 --> 03:09:59,700
I would love food. Oh, there's a person here.

1568
03:10:00,700 --> 03:10:03,700
Hey, you know what I heard?

1569
03:10:03,700 --> 03:10:09,700
Sister Mary was the classmate of Cecilia's mother at the party.

1570
03:10:09,700 --> 03:10:13,700
Both her beautiful and best friends. They were really mischievous.

1571
03:10:13,700 --> 03:10:18,700
It always caused trouble in the abbey. It's hard to imagine Sister Mary like that.

1572
03:10:18,700 --> 03:10:24,700
Does this mean that being mischievous when you're young will lead to youthful discretion at Sister Mary's age?

1573
03:10:24,700 --> 03:10:33,700
Me? I wish for such youthful mischievousness.

1574
03:10:38,700 --> 03:10:42,700
Okay, uh, dizzy.

1575
03:10:42,700 --> 03:10:49,700
Okay, Uncle Logan. Uncle Logan's noodles are world-famous.

1576
03:10:49,700 --> 03:10:55,700
Whenever you are tired, come over and have some chow mein.

1577
03:10:55,700 --> 03:11:00,700
Everything like your HP, MP and V at the gauges are refilled instantly.

1578
03:11:00,700 --> 03:11:06,700
Whenever you are tired, come over and have some chow mein.

1579
03:11:06,700 --> 03:11:11,700
Everything like your HP, MP and V at the gauges are refilled instantly.

1580
03:11:11,700 --> 03:11:16,700
And all negative statuses affect are removed.

1581
03:11:17,700 --> 03:11:30,700
I don't think this is the end.

1582
03:11:30,700 --> 03:11:35,700
Send for a chow mein.

1583
03:11:35,700 --> 03:11:38,700
But, now it is!

1584
03:11:39,700 --> 03:11:45,700
Mama Mia, but Maya chow mein is the only way for you to recover.

1585
03:11:46,700 --> 03:11:59,600
Whenever you level up from your bath or experience your whole body recovers, so keep leveling

1586
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:00,600
up.

1587
03:12:00,600 --> 03:12:07,600
It's like I'm eating Uncle Logan's chow mein!

1588
03:12:30,600 --> 03:12:43,960
It is probably not how this should go.

1589
03:12:43,960 --> 03:12:44,960
Our fagaya.

1590
03:12:44,960 --> 03:12:47,440
I think I read this right?

1591
03:12:47,440 --> 03:12:51,440
Yes, we've read it.

1592
03:12:52,440 --> 03:13:03,440
Of course it's a great name for an Italian chef!

1593
03:13:03,440 --> 03:13:14,440
This one?

1594
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:26,440
Okay, we can't leave!

1595
03:13:44,440 --> 03:14:13,440
So what do I do with this witch book?

1596
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:20,440
Maybe I do have to use it on her or something.

1597
03:14:20,440 --> 03:14:30,440
Now with that book, may I take a look at it?

1598
03:14:30,440 --> 03:14:32,440
And the book of Trish.

1599
03:14:32,440 --> 03:14:33,440
You are read to you now.

1600
03:14:33,440 --> 03:14:38,440
If you get tired, let me know by pressing the star button.

1601
03:14:39,440 --> 03:14:43,440
The dull sound of my footsteps echoed off the floor.

1602
03:14:43,440 --> 03:14:44,440
I was all alone.

1603
03:14:44,440 --> 03:14:50,440
I removed my helmet and shook my head.

1604
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:53,440
I was in the graveyard of the pillar people.

1605
03:14:53,440 --> 03:14:55,440
It was the best location for the experiment.

1606
03:14:55,440 --> 03:15:00,440
Still, I was scared that I had brought the high-density energy crystal here.

1607
03:15:00,440 --> 03:15:05,440
After removing my firearm, I sat on a half-broken stone bench.

1608
03:15:05,440 --> 03:15:07,440
Experiment.

1609
03:15:07,440 --> 03:15:15,440
Using an energy crystal as a catalyst to power the space-time warp to 536 revolutions before,

1610
03:15:15,440 --> 03:15:18,440
was this a way to end the war?

1611
03:15:18,440 --> 03:15:23,440
I rested on the stone and closed my eyes.

1612
03:15:23,440 --> 03:15:28,440
The face of the girl that I killed three days ago floated before my eye.

1613
03:15:28,440 --> 03:15:32,440
What had a civilian been doing here?

1614
03:15:32,440 --> 03:15:35,440
She had approached me and placed her hand in her pocket.

1615
03:15:35,440 --> 03:15:42,440
I thought she was the enemy, and so I had thrust my sword without hesitation.

1616
03:15:42,440 --> 03:15:44,440
But she had been defenseless.

1617
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:46,440
No weapons on her at all.

1618
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:51,440
I sighed deeply and examined the communication device that had laying next to the crystal.

1619
03:15:51,440 --> 03:15:56,440
When I flipped the power switch on, the radio told me to pray.

1620
03:15:56,440 --> 03:15:59,440
I bit my tongue and turned it off.

1621
03:15:59,440 --> 03:16:04,440
For a moment, the green splay illuminated the movements of insects.

1622
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:07,440
336 revolutions ago.

1623
03:16:07,440 --> 03:16:12,440
In those days, God supposedly insisted prayers had purpose.

1624
03:16:12,440 --> 03:16:16,440
But the gods had disappeared somewhere along the way,

1625
03:16:16,440 --> 03:16:25,440
and now we spent our time fighting battles and holding our hands over our hearts in useless prayer.

1626
03:16:25,440 --> 03:16:30,440
The gods we worship had disappeared, so why couldn't people stop praying?

1627
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:37,440
People were still looking for someone to help us and give our sins, but gods didn't exist anymore.

1628
03:16:37,440 --> 03:16:42,440
I rubbed the hilt of my sword and exhaled, used to pray.

1629
03:16:42,440 --> 03:16:46,440
I stood up, but before I started roaming around, the ruins.

1630
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:50,440
I paused to examine the energy crystal.

1631
03:16:50,440 --> 03:16:55,440
Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a cross-shaped star rise above the trees.

1632
03:16:55,440 --> 03:17:01,440
Almost immediately, a blinding white light jumped out of the crystal and engulfed my body.

1633
03:17:04,440 --> 03:17:10,440
The world went white upon impact, and a strangled yell was forced for my throat.

1634
03:17:10,440 --> 03:17:13,440
My internal organs felt as if they were being crushed.

1635
03:17:13,440 --> 03:17:16,440
I tried to let go of the crystal.

1636
03:17:16,440 --> 03:17:23,440
As the pain slowly faded, I felt like I was left floating in an inky black darkness.

1637
03:17:23,440 --> 03:17:27,440
My lips trembled. My senses were locked in.

1638
03:17:27,440 --> 03:17:32,440
Ah, claustrophobic terror. There we go.

1639
03:17:35,440 --> 03:17:38,440
What was happening? Was I dying?

1640
03:17:38,440 --> 03:17:42,440
I almost went crazy at the utter blackness.

1641
03:17:42,440 --> 03:17:47,440
When an orange light engulfed my shoulders, the crystal was collapsing.

1642
03:17:47,440 --> 03:17:54,440
It dissolved a small particle like a fine powder, which floated off into the deep black darkness.

1643
03:17:54,440 --> 03:17:56,440
I calmed down a little.

1644
03:17:56,440 --> 03:18:04,440
The crystal's sudden splintering seemed logical, and for some strange reason, I was sure this was all real and not a dream.

1645
03:18:06,440 --> 03:18:11,440
I felt my body float off in the same direction the lights were floating.

1646
03:18:11,440 --> 03:18:16,440
I couldn't say I knew where I was going, but compared to staying where I was in the darkness,

1647
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:18,440
it seemed the better option.

1648
03:18:20,440 --> 03:18:25,440
All I could do now was pray that I reached some place of safety.

1649
03:18:25,440 --> 03:18:27,440
Pray? Me?

1650
03:18:27,440 --> 03:18:31,440
I took a deep breath and exhaled through my nose.

1651
03:18:31,440 --> 03:18:37,440
I devoted all of my thoughts to prayer, though I felt I could not expect salvation,

1652
03:18:37,440 --> 03:18:43,440
and suddenly, without a surge of hope, I, who never believed in prayer,

1653
03:18:44,440 --> 03:18:52,440
I couldn't... I could feel myself moving faster, though I couldn't actually sense my body.

1654
03:18:52,440 --> 03:18:56,440
Had I been vaporized by the orange light like the crystal,

1655
03:18:56,440 --> 03:18:59,440
I struggled with the idea of having no body.

1656
03:18:59,440 --> 03:19:04,440
Was I just a floating spirit? Thankfully, I lost consciousness.

1657
03:19:05,440 --> 03:19:10,440
I could feel a slight warmth on my cheek, and I regained consciousness.

1658
03:19:10,440 --> 03:19:15,440
Shine? I felt a difference. Suddenly, I could feel my body again.

1659
03:19:15,440 --> 03:19:19,440
Even my ears were tickling. They'd fallen asleep.

1660
03:19:19,440 --> 03:19:23,440
I moved my numb fingers and tried to touch my cheek.

1661
03:19:23,440 --> 03:19:27,440
I heard someone gasp, a slight rustling noise.

1662
03:19:27,440 --> 03:19:31,440
When I opened my eyes, I felt like someone was continuously hitting my head.

1663
03:19:31,440 --> 03:19:34,440
First thing I saw was the warm orange light,

1664
03:19:34,440 --> 03:19:40,440
the bright stained glass window, which scattered them by the sunshine.

1665
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:47,440
Then pale, slender hands, I narrowed my eyes with slender hands for blurry, orange light.

1666
03:19:50,440 --> 03:19:52,440
There's pictures!

1667
03:19:59,440 --> 03:20:03,440
The warm light twinkled and disappeared like magic.

1668
03:20:03,440 --> 03:20:10,440
I blinked, looked upwards, and found eyes that were blue like the southern sea, staring into my home.

1669
03:20:12,440 --> 03:20:14,440
Do you feel any pain?

1670
03:20:14,440 --> 03:20:17,440
Ruby lips, red lips, framed to the question.

1671
03:20:17,440 --> 03:20:21,440
Lustrous hair fringed her small pale face.

1672
03:20:21,440 --> 03:20:23,440
N-no.

1673
03:20:24,440 --> 03:20:25,440
N-no.

1674
03:20:26,440 --> 03:20:27,440
Sorry.

1675
03:20:28,440 --> 03:20:32,440
My voice croaked out of a parched throat.

1676
03:20:32,440 --> 03:20:36,440
She seemed around my own age, 17 or so.

1677
03:20:37,440 --> 03:20:45,440
Her face gave off a strange impression, a mix of precociousness and childlike naivety radiating equally.

1678
03:20:46,440 --> 03:20:53,440
While I was wondering if I should have spoken to her more politely, I started around, trying to see everything.

1679
03:20:54,440 --> 03:20:59,440
While I was wondering if I should have spoken to her more,

1680
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:01,440
wait, fuck, I read that part.

1681
03:21:01,440 --> 03:21:05,440
Her fingers were spotted with fragments of colorful light.

1682
03:21:06,440 --> 03:21:12,440
I could feel the coldness of the stone building, the ceiling yawned high above the chapel.

1683
03:21:13,440 --> 03:21:16,440
Colored dance in the stained glass behind her.

1684
03:21:16,440 --> 03:21:19,440
She looked at my eyes and said,

1685
03:21:20,440 --> 03:21:22,440
Pain canary.

1686
03:21:23,440 --> 03:21:27,440
The world without gods and waiting for you.

1687
03:21:27,440 --> 03:21:29,440
Pain canary?

1688
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:34,440
Her voice was low and gentle.

1689
03:21:34,440 --> 03:21:37,440
I looked away and watched into my lens.

1690
03:21:37,440 --> 03:21:39,440
I noticed that the crystal was gone.

1691
03:21:39,440 --> 03:21:42,440
I could feel the sweat on my palm.

1692
03:21:43,440 --> 03:21:45,440
Something sparked in my brain.

1693
03:21:45,440 --> 03:21:48,440
A space-time experiment.

1694
03:21:48,440 --> 03:21:50,440
Did it work?

1695
03:21:50,440 --> 03:21:53,440
Pain canary, write it down, write it down, write it down!

1696
03:22:07,440 --> 03:22:10,440
I realized she was still waiting for a response.

1697
03:22:10,440 --> 03:22:15,440
Her head cocked to the side and I swallowed, opened my mouth.

1698
03:22:18,440 --> 03:22:22,440
Please, please tell me where this place is and what your name is.

1699
03:22:25,440 --> 03:22:27,440
She smiled softly and nodded.

1700
03:22:27,440 --> 03:22:35,440
This place is 536 revolutions before your world, a place still protected by gods.

1701
03:22:37,440 --> 03:22:42,440
The law of your world differs from those that rule our life.

1702
03:22:42,440 --> 03:22:48,440
She spoke, she combed my hair back, placed her hand on my forehead.

1703
03:22:54,440 --> 03:22:58,440
This is the light of god, of the god of life.

1704
03:22:58,440 --> 03:23:01,440
The magic which dwells in my blood.

1705
03:23:02,440 --> 03:23:04,440
Her eyes closed and she chanted.

1706
03:23:04,440 --> 03:23:08,440
At the same moment she finished, warm light engulfed me again.

1707
03:23:09,440 --> 03:23:11,440
Magic?

1708
03:23:11,440 --> 03:23:13,440
Hey, magic, I whispered.

1709
03:23:13,440 --> 03:23:16,440
Gods exist in this world?

1710
03:23:16,440 --> 03:23:21,440
Yes, I cannot imagine a world where they do not exist.

1711
03:23:21,440 --> 03:23:24,440
She smiles and her blue eyes looked over me.

1712
03:23:24,440 --> 03:23:26,440
She reached out her hand to me.

1713
03:23:26,440 --> 03:23:28,440
I did not understand her smile.

1714
03:23:28,440 --> 03:23:30,440
Welcome to this period, Cain.

1715
03:23:30,440 --> 03:23:32,440
My name is Laurie.

1716
03:23:32,440 --> 03:23:34,440
I'm a rulekeeper.

1717
03:23:34,440 --> 03:23:37,440
I serve the god of time and life.

1718
03:23:39,440 --> 03:23:41,440
I took her hand in mine.

1719
03:23:41,440 --> 03:23:45,440
I wondered how long I had lain on her lap.

1720
03:23:45,440 --> 03:23:49,440
Before I could ask, she looked up, lifted her head slightly and bit her tongue.

1721
03:23:49,440 --> 03:23:51,440
But she noticed something.

1722
03:23:53,440 --> 03:23:55,440
I still need rest.

1723
03:23:56,440 --> 03:24:02,440
The air was chilly like a winter morning, but a strange sensation I never felt before.

1724
03:24:02,440 --> 03:24:04,440
Laurie looked down on me.

1725
03:24:04,440 --> 03:24:06,440
She smiled softly.

1726
03:24:07,440 --> 03:24:09,440
It's okay.

1727
03:24:09,440 --> 03:24:11,440
I will protect you.

1728
03:24:11,440 --> 03:24:13,440
I... I was bored.

1729
03:24:14,440 --> 03:24:17,440
Laurie stood up before I could ask her what she meant.

1730
03:24:17,440 --> 03:24:23,440
And with me, he rushed to the exit of the chapel and pushed open the thick wooden door.

1731
03:24:23,440 --> 03:24:27,440
Because it looked very heavy, I went next to her to help.

1732
03:24:27,440 --> 03:24:29,440
I noticed her body so rigid.

1733
03:24:29,440 --> 03:24:31,440
Matter.

1734
03:24:32,440 --> 03:24:38,440
As soon as I asked her, a white flashing light shined through the stained glass window.

1735
03:24:38,440 --> 03:24:40,440
It's too early.

1736
03:24:40,440 --> 03:24:44,440
Laurie frowned at her lip as she turned around.

1737
03:24:45,440 --> 03:24:47,440
Cain, come with me.

1738
03:24:47,440 --> 03:24:49,440
I have to protect this world.

1739
03:24:49,440 --> 03:24:52,440
So I need your cooperation to do so.

1740
03:24:52,440 --> 03:24:55,440
I need you to go to Passover Festival.

1741
03:24:55,440 --> 03:24:59,440
It will be held in the capital ten days from now.

1742
03:24:59,440 --> 03:25:02,440
Eyes held mine with urgency.

1743
03:25:02,440 --> 03:25:06,440
But people who would disturb it exist.

1744
03:25:06,440 --> 03:25:07,440
What do you mean?

1745
03:25:07,440 --> 03:25:08,440
Who are you?

1746
03:25:08,440 --> 03:25:12,440
I asked for an explanation, but Laurie was not listening to me.

1747
03:25:13,440 --> 03:25:16,440
An explosion occurred at close range.

1748
03:25:16,440 --> 03:25:19,440
I covered my head at once and tried to plant my feet.

1749
03:25:19,440 --> 03:25:22,440
But I was thrown back inside the chapel.

1750
03:25:22,440 --> 03:25:25,440
I groaned as I hit my hip against something.

1751
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:27,440
In my blurred view, I looked for Laurie.

1752
03:25:27,440 --> 03:25:32,440
Her movement switched smoothly from a defensive stance to a fighting one.

1753
03:25:32,440 --> 03:25:34,440
I stood and drew my sword hurriedly.

1754
03:25:34,440 --> 03:25:39,440
The scattered rubble and dust, I could only hear mine and Laurie's breath.

1755
03:25:39,440 --> 03:25:43,440
We moved close together and looked around.

1756
03:25:44,440 --> 03:25:46,440
There was no one around.

1757
03:25:46,440 --> 03:25:51,440
Suddenly the hairs on the back of my neck grizzled, warning me I was wrong.

1758
03:25:51,440 --> 03:25:56,440
A mild early summer sunlight danced merrily on the plain wooden floor.

1759
03:25:56,440 --> 03:25:59,440
But in the quiet room, something was out of place.

1760
03:25:59,440 --> 03:26:02,440
Laurie stood there back to mine.

1761
03:26:02,440 --> 03:26:04,440
I can't believe it.

1762
03:26:04,440 --> 03:26:07,440
I slowly followed her view to the altar.

1763
03:26:07,440 --> 03:26:12,440
For nobody existed seconds ago, a silver-haired girl in black now stood.

1764
03:26:12,440 --> 03:26:16,440
For some reason her face sent shivers down my spine.

1765
03:26:17,440 --> 03:26:20,440
Rule breaker, it's too early.

1766
03:26:20,440 --> 03:26:23,440
You pay no attention to Laurie.

1767
03:26:23,440 --> 03:26:25,440
A beautiful girl smiled at me.

1768
03:26:25,440 --> 03:26:27,440
Her smile was bloody and sinister.

1769
03:26:27,440 --> 03:26:29,440
All I could do was tremble.

1770
03:26:31,440 --> 03:26:32,440
Oh, what?

1771
03:26:32,440 --> 03:26:34,440
Oh, okay, let's stop here.

1772
03:26:34,440 --> 03:26:36,440
These books are really good!

1773
03:26:38,440 --> 03:26:39,440
Damn!

1774
03:26:42,440 --> 03:26:43,440
It's over!

1775
03:26:46,440 --> 03:26:47,440
Do we have more?

1776
03:26:49,440 --> 03:26:50,440
Right?

1777
03:26:50,440 --> 03:26:51,440
Do we have more?

1778
03:26:54,440 --> 03:26:56,440
We need to find the rest!

1779
03:26:56,440 --> 03:26:57,440
What the hell?

1780
03:27:05,440 --> 03:27:07,440
Where's the goddess statue again?

1781
03:27:08,440 --> 03:27:09,440
This one.

1782
03:27:11,440 --> 03:27:16,440
Statue of a holy woman circled by the other statues as if being guarded in the face of the west.

1783
03:27:20,440 --> 03:27:21,440
Is that it?

1784
03:27:23,440 --> 03:27:24,440
Yeah.

1785
03:27:31,440 --> 03:27:33,440
We have to show it the light of light.

1786
03:27:35,440 --> 03:27:37,440
Is it our teardrop?

1787
03:27:37,440 --> 03:27:38,440
Ooh!

1788
03:27:40,440 --> 03:27:42,440
What is she looking at?

1789
03:27:49,440 --> 03:27:52,440
Does it say keep off the grass? I would laugh.

1790
03:27:52,440 --> 03:27:54,440
No rough housing on the lawn!

1791
03:28:05,440 --> 03:28:07,440
Isn't this like...

1792
03:28:07,440 --> 03:28:08,440
What do you call it?

1793
03:28:09,440 --> 03:28:11,440
Isn't this um...

1794
03:28:13,440 --> 03:28:14,440
The Zelda game?

1795
03:28:15,440 --> 03:28:17,440
Breath of the Wild?

1796
03:28:18,440 --> 03:28:22,440
The carving of a mysterious pattern looks like the teardrop.

1797
03:28:23,440 --> 03:28:24,440
I got this.

1798
03:28:32,440 --> 03:28:34,440
It's always the light!

1799
03:28:39,440 --> 03:28:40,440
Sealed library.

1800
03:28:40,440 --> 03:28:50,440
Oh no! It took that long for me to get to the actual prologue thing.

1801
03:28:56,440 --> 03:28:57,440
Oh shit!

1802
03:28:58,440 --> 03:28:59,440
I'm finding books?

1803
03:29:10,440 --> 03:29:26,440
Man! I'm weak as hell! You're right! I need to use my magic! What the hell?

1804
03:29:30,440 --> 03:29:31,440
Fire.

1805
03:29:40,440 --> 03:29:42,440
Burn the book! Oh god!

1806
03:29:42,440 --> 03:29:45,440
Oh, we're anchoring people burning.

1807
03:29:57,440 --> 03:30:00,440
Got tinder staff.

1808
03:30:00,440 --> 03:30:07,440
The tinder staff is a magic staff that emits fire when the button, the B button, no, the square button is pressed.

1809
03:30:07,440 --> 03:30:10,440
You can light torches and melt ice by using the staff.

1810
03:30:10,440 --> 03:30:17,440
You can throw the direction of the fire using the directional button or left analog stick while holding the down button.

1811
03:30:18,440 --> 03:30:20,440
Like this.

1812
03:30:25,440 --> 03:30:28,440
When the candlestick burns, the door will be open.

1813
03:30:30,440 --> 03:30:31,440
Candlestick.

1814
03:30:32,440 --> 03:30:33,440
These guys?

1815
03:30:37,440 --> 03:30:39,440
They're lighting up.

1816
03:30:39,440 --> 03:30:41,440
Guys, I'm kind of dumb.

1817
03:30:45,440 --> 03:30:46,440
Oh!

1818
03:30:48,440 --> 03:30:49,440
Oh!

1819
03:30:49,440 --> 03:30:50,440
Oh!

1820
03:30:50,440 --> 03:30:51,440
Oh!

1821
03:30:51,440 --> 03:30:52,440
Oh!

1822
03:30:52,440 --> 03:30:53,440
Oh!

1823
03:30:53,440 --> 03:30:54,440
Oh!

1824
03:30:54,440 --> 03:30:55,440
Oh!

1825
03:30:55,440 --> 03:30:56,440
Oh!

1826
03:30:56,440 --> 03:30:57,440
Oh!

1827
03:30:57,440 --> 03:30:58,440
Oh!

1828
03:30:58,440 --> 03:30:59,440
Oh!

1829
03:30:59,440 --> 03:31:00,440
Oh!

1830
03:31:00,440 --> 03:31:01,440
Oh!

1831
03:31:01,440 --> 03:31:02,440
Oh!

1832
03:31:02,440 --> 03:31:03,440
Oh!

1833
03:31:03,440 --> 03:31:04,440
Oh!

1834
03:31:04,440 --> 03:31:05,440
Oh!

1835
03:31:06,440 --> 03:31:08,440
Like, yeah, having a...

1836
03:31:11,440 --> 03:31:14,440
Uh, I'm trying to...

1837
03:31:16,440 --> 03:31:18,440
Can I move up?

1838
03:31:19,440 --> 03:31:21,440
This direction's right.

1839
03:31:36,440 --> 03:31:37,440
Oh!

1840
03:31:40,440 --> 03:31:42,440
Oh, maybe it does reach from the top of the stairs.

1841
03:31:42,440 --> 03:31:43,440
I'll go check.

1842
03:31:46,440 --> 03:31:48,440
Yeah, fuck these books.

1843
03:31:49,440 --> 03:31:50,440
Oh!

1844
03:32:04,440 --> 03:32:05,440
Oh!

1845
03:32:05,440 --> 03:32:07,440
Maybe that candle?

1846
03:32:07,440 --> 03:32:08,440
Oh!

1847
03:32:16,440 --> 03:32:18,440
Wow, I feel deceived!

1848
03:32:19,440 --> 03:32:21,440
I feel fucking deceived!

1849
03:32:23,440 --> 03:32:24,440
Ah!

1850
03:32:24,440 --> 03:32:25,440
Oh!

1851
03:32:36,440 --> 03:32:38,440
Hahaha!

1852
03:32:41,440 --> 03:32:43,440
Oh, sorry, not that.

1853
03:32:54,440 --> 03:33:03,440
Is that an urchin?

1854
03:33:03,440 --> 03:33:05,440
It might be.

1855
03:33:05,440 --> 03:33:07,440
I hear urchins are delicious.

1856
03:33:07,440 --> 03:33:08,440
I want to try.

1857
03:33:13,440 --> 03:33:16,440
Okay, well, there's places to go.

1858
03:33:17,440 --> 03:33:19,440
On the side.

1859
03:33:21,440 --> 03:33:22,440
Oh!

1860
03:33:22,440 --> 03:33:24,440
Vip, vip, vip!

1861
03:33:30,440 --> 03:33:33,440
Goodbye, you little shit.

1862
03:33:36,440 --> 03:33:38,440
Have you had sushi?

1863
03:33:38,440 --> 03:33:41,440
Mercy, it's like one of my favorite foods, but, um...

1864
03:33:42,440 --> 03:33:44,440
I've never had urchin before.

1865
03:33:44,440 --> 03:33:49,440
I mostly have, like, you know, like the cheap, um...

1866
03:33:49,440 --> 03:33:51,440
...fishes?

1867
03:33:51,440 --> 03:33:54,440
Like, uh, salmon, tuna...

1868
03:34:00,440 --> 03:34:02,440
What's the other side to?

1869
03:34:02,440 --> 03:34:03,440
This map's huge!

1870
03:34:03,440 --> 03:34:04,440
What the hell?

1871
03:34:09,440 --> 03:34:10,440
The fuck?

1872
03:34:10,440 --> 03:34:12,440
This map is huge!

1873
03:34:19,440 --> 03:34:20,440
Oh!

1874
03:34:28,440 --> 03:34:30,440
Oh, yeah, I've had doonagi!

1875
03:34:30,440 --> 03:34:31,440
I have...

1876
03:34:31,440 --> 03:34:32,440
Oh!

1877
03:34:48,440 --> 03:34:50,440
Yeah, thanks, but I'm just not...

1878
03:34:50,440 --> 03:34:53,440
I'm just like, I don't think I've had urchin before.

1879
03:34:56,440 --> 03:35:00,440
I even had inari sushi, which is, like, just like tofu.

1880
03:35:00,440 --> 03:35:02,440
By the way, it's delicious.

1881
03:35:10,440 --> 03:35:12,440
Oh, I always forget, sorry.

1882
03:35:23,440 --> 03:35:26,440
Uh, and I also like, um...

1883
03:35:27,440 --> 03:35:32,440
I like, kind of like, you know, like the mac-y rolls.

1884
03:35:32,440 --> 03:35:34,440
They're like cucumber and stuff.

1885
03:35:34,440 --> 03:35:35,440
I like those two.

1886
03:35:38,440 --> 03:35:42,440
I'm like, these are very big rules.

1887
03:35:43,440 --> 03:35:47,440
I don't even know which way I'm supposed to go, senpai.

1888
03:35:47,440 --> 03:35:50,440
Should I go down first, or should I go...

1889
03:35:55,440 --> 03:35:56,440
Left?

1890
03:35:58,440 --> 03:35:59,440
Sorry, right?

1891
03:36:01,440 --> 03:36:03,440
Maybe I should go down first?

1892
03:36:03,440 --> 03:36:05,440
No, check the upper levels, okay.

1893
03:36:18,440 --> 03:36:22,440
Maybe they see on this library, because people kept on getting lost.

1894
03:36:22,440 --> 03:36:24,440
Yeah, me, okay, it's a pillbug.

1895
03:36:29,440 --> 03:36:31,440
It does not look like a pillbug.

1896
03:36:33,440 --> 03:36:34,440
Ew, horny.

1897
03:36:34,440 --> 03:36:35,440
I mean...

1898
03:36:46,440 --> 03:36:48,440
Fun fact, California rolls...

1899
03:36:49,440 --> 03:36:52,440
A chef in Vancouver says he invented them.

1900
03:36:52,440 --> 03:36:53,440
Oh, okay.

1901
03:36:54,440 --> 03:37:00,440
I, personally, I don't think I can eat California rolls.

1902
03:37:00,440 --> 03:37:02,440
What's in a California roll again?

1903
03:37:02,440 --> 03:37:04,440
If, um...

1904
03:37:04,440 --> 03:37:06,440
I think I can eat them.

1905
03:37:13,440 --> 03:37:14,440
Not fish eggs.

1906
03:37:15,440 --> 03:37:19,440
It's California roll, um...

1907
03:37:20,440 --> 03:37:22,440
The one with imitation crab.

1908
03:37:22,440 --> 03:37:26,440
Because imitation crab is definitely something that I cannot...

1909
03:37:27,440 --> 03:37:31,440
The sword guardian blade is named Tainted...

1910
03:37:31,440 --> 03:37:34,440
I guess the heart was sent this far on the earth.

1911
03:37:50,440 --> 03:37:52,440
There's egg and imitation crab?

1912
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:54,440
Yeah, it's made with egg.

1913
03:37:57,440 --> 03:38:02,440
That's why I always, when a place goes, yeah, we serve crab.

1914
03:38:02,440 --> 03:38:05,440
I'm like, it's an imitation crab, because I cannot have that.

1915
03:38:11,440 --> 03:38:16,440
I like crab, but like, imitation crab is danger.

1916
03:38:20,440 --> 03:38:23,440
It's danger, and I feel...

1917
03:38:23,440 --> 03:38:26,440
I feel sad, because I'm like, oh!

1918
03:38:28,440 --> 03:38:30,440
Never knew imitation crab with egg.

1919
03:38:30,440 --> 03:38:32,440
Yeah, it's like, oh, eggs.

1920
03:38:33,440 --> 03:38:35,440
The more you know, Senpai!

1921
03:38:36,440 --> 03:38:38,440
Why is there so freaking much?

1922
03:38:41,440 --> 03:38:44,440
How far down does this go?

1923
03:38:54,440 --> 03:38:57,440
I found it out when I was eating crab.

1924
03:38:57,440 --> 03:38:59,440
We were eating imitation crab with my friend,

1925
03:38:59,440 --> 03:39:02,440
because she got like a whole bunch of imitation crab,

1926
03:39:02,440 --> 03:39:04,440
and then I had to go to the hospital!

1927
03:39:04,440 --> 03:39:07,440
Then we found out imitation crab has eggs!

1928
03:39:07,440 --> 03:39:08,440
Great.

1929
03:39:24,440 --> 03:39:27,440
How do I... oh, it's so hard.

1930
03:39:32,440 --> 03:39:35,440
Worst way to find out, oh yeah, oh yeah.

1931
03:39:35,440 --> 03:39:36,440
That's it.

1932
03:39:52,440 --> 03:39:54,440
Also, no ramen, right?

1933
03:39:54,440 --> 03:39:56,440
It depends on the ramen.

1934
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:58,440
It really depends on the ramen.

1935
03:39:59,440 --> 03:40:01,440
So, the ramen...

1936
03:40:02,440 --> 03:40:05,440
There are some ramen I can have.

1937
03:40:05,440 --> 03:40:06,440
Instant ramen?

1938
03:40:06,440 --> 03:40:08,440
Yeah, that's fine.

1939
03:40:19,440 --> 03:40:22,440
Meaghan ramen, also fine.

1940
03:40:32,440 --> 03:40:34,440
It really depends.

1941
03:40:34,440 --> 03:40:37,440
I just have to ask what kind of like...

1942
03:40:37,440 --> 03:40:40,440
What kind of ramen noodles are you using?

1943
03:40:43,440 --> 03:40:45,440
Donkotsu ramen is no good.

1944
03:40:46,440 --> 03:40:48,440
Really, I have to do it all over again?

1945
03:40:51,440 --> 03:40:54,440
Oops, nearly fell and died again.

1946
03:40:55,440 --> 03:40:57,440
I don't know what to do.

1947
03:40:58,440 --> 03:41:01,440
Oops, nearly fell and died again.

1948
03:41:04,440 --> 03:41:05,440
Oops.

1949
03:41:08,440 --> 03:41:10,440
Ah, come on, really?

1950
03:41:19,440 --> 03:41:21,440
Not heal, sorry.

1951
03:41:24,440 --> 03:41:25,440
Ah!

1952
03:41:28,440 --> 03:41:30,440
They're so evil.

1953
03:41:43,440 --> 03:41:44,440
Seriously?

1954
03:41:45,440 --> 03:41:46,440
Ah!

1955
03:41:49,440 --> 03:41:50,440
Ah!

1956
03:41:53,440 --> 03:41:54,440
Ah!

1957
03:41:55,440 --> 03:41:58,440
Which one went out?

1958
03:42:15,440 --> 03:42:17,440
I know I can skip battles.

1959
03:42:17,440 --> 03:42:18,440
I know.

1960
03:42:19,440 --> 03:42:21,440
I just forgot how.

1961
03:42:24,440 --> 03:42:25,440
Ah!

1962
03:42:35,440 --> 03:42:38,440
I hate the angle it's in too.

1963
03:42:55,440 --> 03:42:58,440
Game is stupid and it hates me.

1964
03:43:05,440 --> 03:43:07,440
Oh my god!

1965
03:43:12,440 --> 03:43:14,440
It's a bitch.

1966
03:43:16,440 --> 03:43:18,440
It hit me twice.

1967
03:43:24,440 --> 03:43:25,440
Ah!

1968
03:43:48,440 --> 03:43:49,440
What?

1969
03:43:49,440 --> 03:43:51,440
They were on at the same time, what the hell?

1970
03:43:54,440 --> 03:43:55,440
Ah!

1971
03:44:02,440 --> 03:44:04,440
Can I not fall, thank you?

1972
03:44:24,440 --> 03:44:26,440
Maybe there has to be an order too?

1973
03:44:26,440 --> 03:44:28,440
There's a sign around here?

1974
03:44:29,440 --> 03:44:30,440
Fuck.

1975
03:44:30,440 --> 03:44:32,440
Let me just go back here.

1976
03:44:33,440 --> 03:44:35,440
Of course there's a sign.

1977
03:44:35,440 --> 03:44:39,440
Light up the ends, light up the center,

1978
03:44:39,440 --> 03:44:41,440
but only three then you may enter.

1979
03:44:55,440 --> 03:44:58,440
I hit the wrong one!

1980
03:45:10,440 --> 03:45:11,440
Shut up.

1981
03:45:21,440 --> 03:45:22,440
Oh!

1982
03:45:24,440 --> 03:45:25,440
Ah!

1983
03:45:34,440 --> 03:45:35,440
Ah!

1984
03:45:42,440 --> 03:45:44,440
Go out already.

1985
03:45:54,440 --> 03:45:55,440
Ah!

1986
03:46:15,440 --> 03:46:16,440
That is...

1987
03:46:17,440 --> 03:46:20,440
That's actually so mean.

1988
03:46:24,440 --> 03:46:25,440
Fuck!

1989
03:46:29,440 --> 03:46:30,440
Fuck!

1990
03:46:33,440 --> 03:46:35,440
It's the angles that are really hard.

1991
03:46:35,440 --> 03:46:36,440
Sorry, senpai.

1992
03:46:36,440 --> 03:46:38,440
I'm kind of stupid.

1993
03:46:38,440 --> 03:46:40,440
I keep on hitting the two of them.

1994
03:46:40,440 --> 03:46:42,440
I have to go like this.

1995
03:46:44,440 --> 03:46:46,440
I'm going to go like this.

1996
03:46:46,440 --> 03:46:48,440
I'm going to go like this.

1997
03:46:48,440 --> 03:46:50,440
I'm going to go like this.

1998
03:46:50,440 --> 03:46:52,440
I'm going to go like this.

1999
03:46:52,440 --> 03:46:54,440
I'm going to go like this.

2000
03:47:07,440 --> 03:47:08,440
Come on.

2001
03:47:18,440 --> 03:47:20,440
It's really unfair of the timing.

2002
03:47:22,440 --> 03:47:23,440
Come on.

2003
03:47:40,440 --> 03:47:43,440
If I do it sideways,

2004
03:47:43,440 --> 03:47:45,440
maybe it will work.

2005
03:47:52,440 --> 03:47:53,440
No.

2006
03:47:53,440 --> 03:47:55,440
It does not work.

2007
03:48:02,440 --> 03:48:03,440
Ah!

2008
03:48:11,440 --> 03:48:13,440
It's so fucking hard to...

2009
03:48:13,440 --> 03:48:15,440
Where the fuck are you looking at?

2010
03:48:22,440 --> 03:48:23,440
Come on.

2011
03:48:36,440 --> 03:48:37,440
Damn.

2012
03:48:45,440 --> 03:48:48,440
I'm actually kind of sick of this puzzle.

2013
03:48:48,440 --> 03:48:50,440
It's the aiming?

2014
03:48:50,440 --> 03:48:53,440
That was so bad.

2015
03:48:53,440 --> 03:48:57,440
The aiming was the hard part, senpai.

2016
03:49:00,440 --> 03:49:01,440
It's not...

2017
03:49:01,440 --> 03:49:02,440
This is not easy.

2018
03:49:02,440 --> 03:49:04,440
I don't believe...

2019
03:49:04,440 --> 03:49:09,440
See, I end up aiming there

2020
03:49:09,440 --> 03:49:12,440
because she doesn't do good.

2021
03:49:16,440 --> 03:49:17,440
See?

2022
03:49:34,440 --> 03:49:37,440
I can't skip battles anymore.

2023
03:49:37,440 --> 03:49:39,440
This is going to be hell.

2024
03:49:40,440 --> 03:49:41,440
Ah!

2025
03:49:50,440 --> 03:49:52,440
Fucking idiot.

2026
03:49:52,440 --> 03:49:54,440
Fucking idiot.

2027
03:50:00,440 --> 03:50:02,440
Fucking idiot.

2028
03:50:10,440 --> 03:50:11,440
Okay.

2029
03:50:18,440 --> 03:50:19,440
Okay, I can't...

2030
03:50:19,440 --> 03:50:21,440
I can't do it anymore.

2031
03:50:22,440 --> 03:50:23,440
Okay.

2032
03:50:41,440 --> 03:50:43,440
Does it not work if you shoot them straight on?

2033
03:50:43,440 --> 03:50:44,440
Because I...

2034
03:50:44,440 --> 03:50:46,440
If I shoot them straight on,

2035
03:50:46,440 --> 03:50:48,440
they hit...

2036
03:50:49,440 --> 03:50:52,440
They don't hit them all the time.

2037
03:51:00,440 --> 03:51:02,440
You son of a bitch!

2038
03:51:18,440 --> 03:51:22,440
My death perception, bad.

2039
03:51:48,440 --> 03:51:51,440
I ain't want to kill this game.

2040
03:52:01,440 --> 03:52:03,440
I want to kill this game.

2041
03:52:03,440 --> 03:52:05,440
I want to kill this game.

2042
03:52:18,440 --> 03:52:20,440
Fuck!

2043
03:52:48,440 --> 03:52:51,440
We're able to skip these battles.

2044
03:52:51,440 --> 03:52:53,440
At least they don't hurt me anymore

2045
03:52:53,440 --> 03:52:55,440
because I'm too high level.

2046
03:52:55,440 --> 03:52:57,440
I'm just mad now.

2047
03:52:59,440 --> 03:53:01,440
I'm just mad now.

2048
03:53:01,440 --> 03:53:03,440
I'm just mad.

2049
03:53:05,440 --> 03:53:06,440
Just mad.

2050
03:53:10,440 --> 03:53:11,440
I swear.

2051
03:53:11,440 --> 03:53:12,440
I swear.

2052
03:53:12,440 --> 03:53:13,440
I swear.

2053
03:53:13,440 --> 03:53:14,440
I swear.

2054
03:53:14,440 --> 03:53:15,440
I swear.

2055
03:53:16,440 --> 03:53:19,440
I swear if someone's going like...

2056
03:53:20,440 --> 03:53:23,440
Like, please be patient with me, Senpai.

2057
03:53:24,440 --> 03:53:26,440
Please be patient with me.

2058
03:53:29,440 --> 03:53:31,440
Move faster.

2059
03:54:16,440 --> 03:54:19,440
You have to be so quick with it.

2060
03:54:19,440 --> 03:54:22,440
I hate how fast you have to be with it.

2061
03:54:24,440 --> 03:54:26,440
I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.

2062
03:54:46,440 --> 03:54:48,440
Ugh.

2063
03:54:52,440 --> 03:54:54,440
We hate books.

2064
03:54:54,440 --> 03:54:56,440
Just kidding. I love books.

2065
03:54:56,440 --> 03:54:58,440
But not these ones!

2066
03:55:04,440 --> 03:55:07,440
That was not a well-designed puzzle.

2067
03:55:08,440 --> 03:55:10,440
Mostly because of the timing.

2068
03:55:10,440 --> 03:55:12,440
I feel like...

2069
03:55:15,440 --> 03:55:17,440
I feel like...

2070
03:55:25,440 --> 03:55:27,440
I feel like...

2071
03:55:28,440 --> 03:55:32,440
If they just lowered the enemy encounter rate there,

2072
03:55:32,440 --> 03:55:34,440
it would have been easier.

2073
03:55:34,440 --> 03:55:36,440
Alright.

2074
03:55:41,440 --> 03:55:43,440
High fires with short lives.

2075
03:55:43,440 --> 03:55:45,440
By standing at its peak, give life.

2076
03:55:45,440 --> 03:55:47,440
Then the door shall be opened.

2077
03:55:58,440 --> 03:56:00,440
Alright.

2078
03:56:01,440 --> 03:56:04,440
Oh my gosh, they're so...

2079
03:56:15,440 --> 03:56:17,440
Warcry.

2080
03:56:24,440 --> 03:56:26,440
How big is this freaking map?

2081
03:56:30,440 --> 03:56:32,440
The music's good, yeah?

2082
03:56:32,440 --> 03:56:34,440
The music's pretty good.

2083
03:56:34,440 --> 03:56:36,440
I'm just... I'm just mad.

2084
03:56:41,440 --> 03:56:43,440
I'm just mad now.

2085
03:56:43,440 --> 03:56:45,440
I'm so clumpy.

2086
03:56:45,440 --> 03:56:47,440
I'm so clumpy, Senpai.

2087
03:56:49,440 --> 03:56:51,440
Meow.

2088
03:56:51,440 --> 03:56:53,440
I'm so clumpy, Senpai.

2089
03:56:54,440 --> 03:56:56,440
Meow.

2090
03:57:00,440 --> 03:57:02,440
I'm so clumpy!

2091
03:57:12,440 --> 03:57:16,440
I think that puzzle really sucked because of the encounter rate.

2092
03:57:16,440 --> 03:57:20,440
The encounter rate for that area I felt like was pretty high.

2093
03:57:27,440 --> 03:57:33,440
The tear drop faintly shimmers as your eyes glaze the stone statue.

2094
03:57:33,440 --> 03:57:35,440
Nice.

2095
03:57:52,440 --> 03:57:57,440
Honestly, I think if they lowered the encounter rate for that one area,

2096
03:57:57,440 --> 03:57:59,440
that would have been better.

2097
03:57:59,440 --> 03:58:02,440
But for some reason, the encounter rate in that area seems...

2098
03:58:03,440 --> 03:58:05,440
Quite high?

2099
03:58:09,440 --> 03:58:11,440
You know?

2100
03:58:29,440 --> 03:58:31,440
Going on here.

2101
03:58:34,440 --> 03:58:36,440
Oh!

2102
03:58:46,440 --> 03:58:50,440
Press and hold X in front of the wheel to make the character grab the real rotate.

2103
03:58:50,440 --> 03:58:53,440
Left analog stick to make the character off the...

2104
03:58:53,440 --> 03:58:55,440
This?

2105
03:58:57,440 --> 03:58:59,440
Oh!

2106
03:58:59,440 --> 03:59:03,440
I literally have to use it like a wheel.

2107
03:59:07,440 --> 03:59:09,440
Okay, actually that's kind of hard.

2108
03:59:18,440 --> 03:59:20,440
That's really hard!

2109
03:59:29,440 --> 03:59:31,440
Oh!

2110
03:59:54,440 --> 03:59:56,440
Fuck. I can't fucking see.

2111
04:00:00,440 --> 04:00:03,440
I took a while to see what it meant.

2112
04:00:07,440 --> 04:00:09,440
And you will claim.

2113
04:00:15,440 --> 04:00:20,440
It just... You have to spin it several times before it can...

2114
04:00:20,440 --> 04:00:22,440
Before the wheel can like...

2115
04:00:22,440 --> 04:00:24,440
Before it can actually move.

2116
04:00:24,440 --> 04:00:26,440
It's kind of annoying.

2117
04:00:26,440 --> 04:00:28,440
It's kind of annoying.

2118
04:00:28,440 --> 04:00:30,440
Okay.

2119
04:00:51,440 --> 04:00:53,440
Because I didn't know if it was working.

2120
04:00:53,440 --> 04:00:56,440
It just felt like it wasn't working, you know?

2121
04:00:58,440 --> 04:01:00,440
Okay.

2122
04:01:11,440 --> 04:01:14,440
But like, I legitimately thought it wasn't working.

2123
04:01:19,440 --> 04:01:21,440
Okay, so...

2124
04:01:21,440 --> 04:01:23,440
All you have to do.

2125
04:01:28,440 --> 04:01:30,440
Now...

2126
04:01:35,440 --> 04:01:37,440
I can climb all the way up here.

2127
04:01:47,440 --> 04:01:49,440
Stay in a second!

2128
04:01:50,440 --> 04:01:52,440
This is where I started!

2129
04:01:59,440 --> 04:02:01,440
Bye-bye!

2130
04:02:02,440 --> 04:02:04,440
Thank you for the...

2131
04:02:07,440 --> 04:02:09,440
I don't know what A is.

2132
04:02:09,440 --> 04:02:13,440
Thank you for the... Is that Australian?

2133
04:02:14,440 --> 04:02:17,440
Oh! Super Cat! Hi! Hi! Game's Drop!

2134
04:02:20,440 --> 04:02:22,440
Where was I supposed to go then?

2135
04:02:29,440 --> 04:02:31,440
Wait, was there...

2136
04:02:31,440 --> 04:02:33,440
Oh, shit. Sorry.

2137
04:02:37,440 --> 04:02:39,440
There like, some place over...

2138
04:02:39,440 --> 04:02:41,440
Oh!

2139
04:02:45,440 --> 04:02:47,440
It's Australian! Okay!

2140
04:02:59,440 --> 04:03:01,440
She's only level 4! That's surprising!

2141
04:03:08,440 --> 04:03:10,440
There's like, other rooms here now.

2142
04:03:15,440 --> 04:03:17,440
Wait.

2143
04:03:23,440 --> 04:03:25,440
Did I go here already?

2144
04:03:28,440 --> 04:03:30,440
Ready?

2145
04:03:34,440 --> 04:03:36,440
Memory shot!

2146
04:03:59,440 --> 04:04:01,440
Was I there already?

2147
04:04:06,440 --> 04:04:08,440
Sorry!

2148
04:04:08,440 --> 04:04:11,440
I feel like my memory is like, gone.

2149
04:04:18,440 --> 04:04:21,440
Oh! I think I know where we are now.

2150
04:04:25,440 --> 04:04:27,440
She moved so fast.

2151
04:04:28,440 --> 04:04:30,440
Oh!

2152
04:04:34,440 --> 04:04:36,440
Memory no good!

2153
04:04:36,440 --> 04:04:39,440
Just like me, for real, for real.

2154
04:04:40,440 --> 04:04:43,440
Oh, I see. It's a completely different room up here.

2155
04:04:43,440 --> 04:04:45,440
It's good.

2156
04:04:47,440 --> 04:04:49,440
What does this do?

2157
04:04:58,440 --> 04:05:01,440
I'm gonna put this to the center again.

2158
04:05:28,440 --> 04:05:30,440
I don't know.

2159
04:05:58,440 --> 04:06:00,440
Bye bye!

2160
04:06:05,440 --> 04:06:07,440
Bye bye!

2161
04:06:09,440 --> 04:06:11,440
Bye bye!

2162
04:06:29,440 --> 04:06:32,440
Is this not what I'm doing right now?

2163
04:06:34,440 --> 04:06:37,440
Okay, okay. Settle down, chat.

2164
04:06:58,440 --> 04:07:00,440
Life on this planet.

2165
04:07:02,440 --> 04:07:04,440
Yeah, I'll just fight it.

2166
04:07:10,440 --> 04:07:13,440
Blue Book. I love how it's just called Blue Book!

2167
04:07:28,440 --> 04:07:30,440
Oh!

2168
04:07:50,440 --> 04:07:52,440
Gradual.

2169
04:07:53,440 --> 04:07:55,440
Because I can't.

2170
04:07:58,440 --> 04:08:00,440
I can't.

2171
04:08:07,440 --> 04:08:10,440
Senpai! Senpai!

2172
04:08:10,440 --> 04:08:13,440
Thank you for the two super chat.

2173
04:08:13,440 --> 04:08:15,440
Is that all?

2174
04:08:15,440 --> 04:08:18,440
I just wanted to hear the senpai.

2175
04:08:19,440 --> 04:08:21,440
FX again.

2176
04:08:21,440 --> 04:08:23,440
Yay!

2177
04:08:24,440 --> 04:08:26,440
Okie dokie!

2178
04:08:29,440 --> 04:08:31,440
I like reading books.

2179
04:08:33,440 --> 04:08:35,440
Book of Genesis.

2180
04:08:36,440 --> 04:08:38,440
This is the story of the Elu Sword.

2181
04:08:38,440 --> 04:08:42,440
A blacksmith forged the sword from living metal.

2182
04:08:42,440 --> 04:08:44,440
It was forged to open the world's future,

2183
04:08:44,440 --> 04:08:47,440
as it was in the beginning, so be it in the end.

2184
04:08:47,440 --> 04:08:50,440
This is the blade that defends the dark

2185
04:08:50,440 --> 04:08:52,440
and slays their asses.

2186
04:08:52,440 --> 04:08:54,440
This is the blade that defends the dark

2187
04:08:54,440 --> 04:08:56,440
and slays their asses.

2188
04:08:56,440 --> 04:08:59,440
The sword was named Guardian Blade.

2189
04:08:59,440 --> 04:09:02,440
It is imbued with the power to save worlds.

2190
04:09:05,440 --> 04:09:07,440
Lost Guardian.

2191
04:09:07,440 --> 04:09:10,440
The guardian lord who ruled all life,

2192
04:09:10,440 --> 04:09:12,440
the lord of the four guardians

2193
04:09:12,440 --> 04:09:15,440
who ruled the basis of all creation.

2194
04:09:15,440 --> 04:09:19,440
They were not bound to the past, the power of pain.

2195
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:21,440
Guardians who fed courage,

2196
04:09:21,440 --> 04:09:23,440
the courage to live in the present,

2197
04:09:23,440 --> 04:09:25,440
the power to shield the mind.

2198
04:09:25,440 --> 04:09:27,440
Guardians who fueled love,

2199
04:09:27,440 --> 04:09:28,440
desire for the future,

2200
04:09:28,440 --> 04:09:30,440
the belief that dreams do come true.

2201
04:09:30,440 --> 04:09:32,440
Guardians who ruled hope,

2202
04:09:32,440 --> 04:09:35,440
the light that once lived in everyone's hearts.

2203
04:09:35,440 --> 04:09:38,440
Courage, love, and hope are lost in time.

2204
04:09:38,440 --> 04:09:41,440
Even their meanings have been long forgotten.

2205
04:09:42,440 --> 04:09:43,440
Aw.

2206
04:09:44,440 --> 04:09:46,440
Properties and its meaning.

2207
04:09:47,440 --> 04:09:49,440
The guiding principle of a Crest Sorcerer

2208
04:09:49,440 --> 04:09:51,440
is to know the weakness of an enemy.

2209
04:09:51,440 --> 04:09:53,440
I'm an enemy!

2210
04:09:58,440 --> 04:10:01,440
For example, the creature Nelgal

2211
04:10:01,440 --> 04:10:03,440
is charged with the power of fire.

2212
04:10:03,440 --> 04:10:06,440
So one who possesses water and ice

2213
04:10:06,440 --> 04:10:07,440
is an enemy.

2214
04:10:07,440 --> 04:10:09,440
This is Nemesis.

2215
04:10:09,440 --> 04:10:10,440
Nemesis!

2216
04:10:10,440 --> 04:10:12,440
Wow, I am like biting my tongue

2217
04:10:12,440 --> 04:10:14,440
all the time.

2218
04:10:21,440 --> 04:10:24,440
I'm biting my tongue as I'm like speaking.

2219
04:10:25,440 --> 04:10:26,440
Yeah.

2220
04:10:26,440 --> 04:10:29,440
During the battle, vulnerability is very important,

2221
04:10:29,440 --> 04:10:30,440
especially for a Crest Sorcerer.

2222
04:10:30,440 --> 04:10:33,440
Use the elements to affect the battle.

2223
04:10:33,440 --> 04:10:36,440
I must know the enemy and their weakness.

2224
04:10:36,440 --> 04:10:39,440
This is the first step towards victory over an opponent.

2225
04:10:43,440 --> 04:10:45,440
Okay, let's see what this...

2226
04:10:47,440 --> 04:10:48,440
Move fast!

2227
04:10:48,440 --> 04:10:49,440
Thank you.

2228
04:10:51,440 --> 04:10:52,440
I'm the...

2229
04:10:54,440 --> 04:10:57,440
Sorry, Omegaverse mansion!

2230
04:10:57,440 --> 04:11:00,440
I am the Alpha and Omega, past and future united.

2231
04:11:00,440 --> 04:11:02,440
The future is made by my edge.

2232
04:11:02,440 --> 04:11:05,440
Speak my name and remember the lonesome history.

2233
04:11:09,440 --> 04:11:12,440
It was Guardian Blade, right?

2234
04:11:22,440 --> 04:11:24,440
I felt Guardian again.

2235
04:11:27,440 --> 04:11:28,440
A...

2236
04:11:29,440 --> 04:11:30,440
R...

2237
04:11:32,440 --> 04:11:33,440
B...

2238
04:11:35,440 --> 04:11:36,440
A...

2239
04:11:37,440 --> 04:11:38,440
I...

2240
04:11:38,440 --> 04:11:39,440
A...

2241
04:11:39,440 --> 04:11:40,440
N...

2242
04:11:43,440 --> 04:11:45,440
How do I do a space?

2243
04:11:45,440 --> 04:11:46,440
Like this?

2244
04:11:46,440 --> 04:11:47,440
Oh, yeah!

2245
04:11:48,440 --> 04:11:49,440
Blood...

2246
04:11:49,440 --> 04:11:50,440
Blood...

2247
04:11:54,440 --> 04:11:55,440
Blade...

2248
04:11:55,440 --> 04:11:56,440
A...

2249
04:11:57,440 --> 04:11:58,440
C...

2250
04:11:59,440 --> 04:12:00,440
That...

2251
04:12:00,440 --> 04:12:01,440
Oh, it fits!

2252
04:12:01,440 --> 04:12:03,440
So, I hope it is.

2253
04:12:03,440 --> 04:12:08,440
I can use both sides, right?

2254
04:12:08,440 --> 04:12:09,440
It doesn't matter.

2255
04:12:09,440 --> 04:12:11,440
It looks like it just goes in one circle.

2256
04:12:33,440 --> 04:12:36,440
Oh, at least that did nothing to me!

2257
04:12:37,440 --> 04:12:40,440
It sounded scary, but it did nothing!

2258
04:12:41,440 --> 04:12:43,440
Okay, I'm putting my eyepatch back on.

2259
04:12:43,440 --> 04:12:45,440
Sorry, I needed to concentrate!

2260
04:12:45,440 --> 04:12:46,440
I...

2261
04:12:46,440 --> 04:12:47,440
I...

2262
04:12:47,440 --> 04:12:48,440
I...

2263
04:12:48,440 --> 04:12:49,440
I...

2264
04:12:49,440 --> 04:12:50,440
I...

2265
04:12:50,440 --> 04:12:51,440
I...

2266
04:12:51,440 --> 04:12:52,440
I...

2267
04:12:52,440 --> 04:12:53,440
I...

2268
04:12:53,440 --> 04:12:54,440
I...

2269
04:12:54,440 --> 04:12:55,440
I...

2270
04:12:55,440 --> 04:12:56,440
I...

2271
04:12:56,440 --> 04:12:57,440
I...

2272
04:12:57,440 --> 04:12:58,440
I...

2273
04:12:58,440 --> 04:12:59,440
I...

2274
04:12:59,440 --> 04:13:00,440
I...

2275
04:13:00,440 --> 04:13:01,440
I call this high-five!

2276
04:13:01,440 --> 04:13:02,440
I...

2277
04:13:02,440 --> 04:13:03,440
I...

2278
04:13:03,440 --> 04:13:04,440
I...

2279
04:13:04,440 --> 04:13:05,440
I...

2280
04:13:05,440 --> 04:13:08,940
I usually sit on my desk,

2281
04:13:08,940 --> 04:13:10,440
just to catch back on...

2282
04:13:10,440 --> 04:13:11,440
Sorry.

2283
04:13:11,440 --> 04:13:12,440
I needed to concentrate!

2284
04:13:12,440 --> 04:13:13,440
Oh!

2285
04:13:13,440 --> 04:13:24,880
I look cooler with my- I look so cool though, Zempai.

2286
04:13:24,880 --> 04:13:36,120
Wait, was there more books I could look at?

2287
04:13:36,120 --> 04:14:04,360
I want to read the books!

2288
04:14:04,360 --> 04:14:27,720
Oh, there were- there were more, and I'm just seeing it now, what the heck?

2289
04:14:27,720 --> 04:14:42,360
Fall off.

2290
04:14:42,360 --> 04:14:45,080
Stand Into World is a title that caught your eye, would you like to read it?

2291
04:14:45,080 --> 04:14:46,080
Yes.

2292
04:14:46,080 --> 04:14:51,120
A world outside of the Ring of Order represents a world without harmony.

2293
04:14:51,120 --> 04:14:55,160
It's certainly- it will certainly face destruction.

2294
04:14:55,160 --> 04:15:02,880
Before we face the coming end, we the aloo abandon this world and leave it- leave it

2295
04:15:02,880 --> 04:15:04,480
to its future doom.

2296
04:15:04,480 --> 04:15:10,200
We exist within the life force of this world, so when the world ends, so do we.

2297
04:15:10,200 --> 04:15:14,320
Peer far into the distance, and we shall be no more.

2298
04:15:14,320 --> 04:15:16,600
Hey what?

2299
04:15:16,600 --> 04:15:22,040
You- you- you laughed?

2300
04:15:22,040 --> 04:15:27,520
Did you just like, aww, you know?

2301
04:15:27,520 --> 04:15:28,840
Do.

2302
04:15:28,840 --> 04:15:30,520
First wanderer.

2303
04:15:30,520 --> 04:15:35,880
Neither monsters, snare, nor dust storms bite can take the wings from the wanderer's

2304
04:15:35,880 --> 04:15:36,880
flight.

2305
04:15:36,880 --> 04:15:41,640
In Fugaya, adventures are called wanderers.

2306
04:15:41,640 --> 04:15:49,480
Some prefer to call them dream chasers, migrants, drifters, or mercs.

2307
04:15:49,480 --> 04:15:55,560
The aloo's- aloo's are doomers, yeah, yeah they are.

2308
04:15:55,560 --> 04:16:00,120
They are like migrating birds moving from one place to another, nomads.

2309
04:16:00,120 --> 04:16:06,260
folklore and writings tell us that among the first wanderers was a character named Alan

2310
04:16:06,260 --> 04:16:12,440
Smithy.

2311
04:16:12,440 --> 04:16:17,680
Alan Smithy's legend is steeped in mystery.

2312
04:16:17,680 --> 04:16:23,440
In fact, recent studies suggest that it is doubtful that such a character ever existed.

2313
04:16:23,440 --> 04:16:29,080
It also just suggested the name Alan Smithy is only a euphemism to describe the moral

2314
04:16:29,080 --> 04:16:32,200
and values of the wanderer culture.

2315
04:16:32,200 --> 04:16:49,640
Although there was ever a real man named Alan Smithy, we don't ever know, perfect.

2316
04:17:19,640 --> 04:17:47,400
Wait, if it runs away I have no EXP, that's so rude.

2317
04:17:47,400 --> 04:18:17,240
Well I don't have enough MP, so I have to hit it.

2318
04:18:17,240 --> 04:18:38,600
I was hoping she would level up already, but she didn't.

2319
04:18:38,600 --> 04:19:06,400
Give me my MPs back.

2320
04:19:06,400 --> 04:19:36,240
I need 6 MP, that sucks, at least, at least they die, and I literally take no health.

2321
04:19:36,240 --> 04:20:05,920
This might take a while, sorry Senpai, do you have any items or skills to restore MP?

2322
04:20:05,920 --> 04:20:24,440
I have no idea.

2323
04:20:24,440 --> 04:20:28,080
I just kind of want to hit them.

2324
04:20:28,080 --> 04:20:34,280
I'll look at the item list soon.

2325
04:20:34,280 --> 04:20:55,920
I just want her, I just want Cecilia to level up quickly so that she can just get it.

2326
04:20:55,920 --> 04:21:15,400
Yeah, see, we got all our MPs back.

2327
04:21:15,400 --> 04:21:23,760
See, we got it Senpai, we did it.

2328
04:21:23,760 --> 04:21:36,000
We have book, it's a book, infinite sequence systems.

2329
04:21:36,000 --> 04:21:48,240
The reason time has no end is that new time is constantly being created by a machine.

2330
04:21:48,240 --> 04:21:53,520
Some people believe a guardian rules time and call it the infinite sequence system,

2331
04:21:53,520 --> 04:21:56,400
or perpetual engine.

2332
04:21:56,400 --> 04:22:06,440
That is a new one, like a machine creating time, a person standing on the altar of time

2333
04:22:06,440 --> 04:22:08,440
can control time as they please.

2334
04:22:08,440 --> 04:22:13,040
What do people hope to accomplish by controlling time, changing the past, creating a new future

2335
04:22:13,040 --> 04:22:22,040
I do not know.

2336
04:22:22,040 --> 04:22:23,040
Garden Fagalia

2337
04:22:23,040 --> 04:22:29,800
There are some Fagalia guardians legends, some guardians exist only in folklore, but

2338
04:22:29,800 --> 04:22:31,000
some are real.

2339
04:22:31,000 --> 04:22:32,520
Guardians ruled Fagalia.

2340
04:22:32,520 --> 04:22:37,240
I do not know what they look like, their powers are even their names, secret mysterious

2341
04:22:37,240 --> 04:22:38,240
guardians.

2342
04:22:39,080 --> 04:22:47,680
Koran doctrine tells us that these guardians, not spoken of in folklore of heretics, hold

2343
04:22:47,680 --> 04:22:50,080
the key to regenerating this planet.

2344
04:22:50,080 --> 04:22:56,080
Who is this being?

2345
04:22:56,080 --> 04:23:05,520
Alright, let's go.

2346
04:23:05,520 --> 04:23:12,520
Is this the book of dead?

2347
04:23:12,520 --> 04:23:25,200
Book of Nogaw, and the book, when this book was written, seems to be about an old monster

2348
04:23:25,200 --> 04:23:35,480
who was born from magic and consumes magical powers, Nogaw.

2349
04:23:35,480 --> 04:23:44,040
The skin book, yeah.

2350
04:23:44,040 --> 04:23:48,600
Are you seeking wisdom for power, or are you the one who heard the whisper of water?

2351
04:23:48,600 --> 04:23:53,720
No matter which you are, read this as a book written by dark forces, everything is now

2352
04:23:53,720 --> 04:24:16,280
Nogaw's flushing blood.

2353
04:24:16,280 --> 04:24:35,360
This looks like a dojin material.

2354
04:24:35,360 --> 04:24:40,240
As a human being, you radiate magical power.

2355
04:24:40,240 --> 04:24:47,360
Nogaw deems you worthy for consumption.

2356
04:24:47,360 --> 04:24:48,360
Am I wrong?

2357
04:24:48,360 --> 04:24:54,640
Am I wrong, though?

2358
04:24:54,640 --> 04:24:57,520
You're the voice that's been calling me?

2359
04:24:57,520 --> 04:25:08,600
No, I only have sinister thoughts from you.

2360
04:25:08,600 --> 04:25:14,040
Hear the water whispering, convince me of your power if you are the shaman.

2361
04:25:14,040 --> 04:25:17,440
The whisper of water?

2362
04:25:17,440 --> 04:25:18,440
Shaman?

2363
04:25:18,440 --> 04:25:23,200
If you would like to hear the voice, you should defeat me and see.

2364
04:25:23,200 --> 04:25:37,800
The whisper of water is there.

2365
04:25:37,800 --> 04:25:41,440
No effect, shit.

2366
04:25:41,440 --> 04:25:42,440
Scoop up!

2367
04:25:42,440 --> 04:25:43,440
No!

2368
04:25:43,440 --> 04:25:46,240
Oh wait, it's not too bad.

2369
04:25:46,240 --> 04:25:47,240
Damn!

2370
04:25:47,240 --> 04:26:16,240
If it has no effect on him, what do I do?

2371
04:26:16,240 --> 04:26:17,240
Do you spell on me?

2372
04:26:17,240 --> 04:26:18,240
Maybe on him?

2373
04:26:18,240 --> 04:26:23,240
Wait, why is there, like, many of you?

2374
04:26:23,240 --> 04:26:37,240
Come in Cecilia, listen to me, release Guardian's power.

2375
04:26:37,240 --> 04:26:38,240
Obtained medium?

2376
04:26:38,240 --> 04:26:39,240
Oh, was it?

2377
04:26:39,240 --> 04:26:44,240
Cecilia, forceability, and material manifest Guardian powers temporarily by consuming F.P.

2378
04:26:45,240 --> 04:26:50,240
Depending on which elemental medium you select, consume F.P. and the effects of the power are

2379
04:26:50,240 --> 04:26:51,240
different.

2380
04:26:51,240 --> 04:26:54,240
For example, the water guardian, Scroogeardark.

2381
04:26:54,240 --> 04:26:55,240
Scroogeardark?

2382
04:26:55,240 --> 04:27:04,240
Attacks all enemies with water, give me a try.

2383
04:27:04,240 --> 04:27:22,240
Ooh, pretty.

2384
04:27:22,240 --> 04:27:33,240
Oh, that's a lot of stuff.

2385
04:27:34,240 --> 04:27:43,240
Damn.

2386
04:28:13,240 --> 04:28:29,240
Aw, no.

2387
04:28:29,240 --> 04:28:58,240
What is this name?

2388
04:28:59,240 --> 04:29:03,240
Scroogeardark.

2389
04:29:03,240 --> 04:29:09,240
Long ago, I was captured and imprisoned in a book by Nelgau's magical power.

2390
04:29:09,240 --> 04:29:14,240
Shaman, I have longed for you to listen to my whisper.

2391
04:29:14,240 --> 04:29:15,240
Shaman.

2392
04:29:15,240 --> 04:29:19,240
Shaman, why do you call me Shaman?

2393
04:29:19,240 --> 04:29:25,240
You are the one who understands our spirit and can change your spirit to power.

2394
04:29:25,240 --> 04:29:28,240
Shaman, inheritor of the teardrop.

2395
04:29:28,240 --> 04:29:37,240
After this long period of time, Gogaia is about to be enveloped in darkness.

2396
04:29:37,240 --> 04:29:40,240
Shaman, can you hear it in your mind?

2397
04:29:40,240 --> 04:29:46,240
The sorrow of the sky and ocean, the anger of earth and wind.

2398
04:29:46,240 --> 04:29:54,240
Yes, I can hear, I can hear, I can feel the teardrop connecting me to those voices.

2399
04:29:55,240 --> 04:29:58,240
Shaman, unite us.

2400
04:29:58,240 --> 04:30:04,240
Use our power to fight the Stio Menace, which threatens all life on this world.

2401
04:30:04,240 --> 04:30:09,240
The battle for sky and earth is about to begin once more.

2402
04:30:09,240 --> 04:30:13,240
The gate to death, Lolithia, will be opened.

2403
04:30:13,240 --> 04:30:16,240
A messenger of Armageddon will appear.

2404
04:30:16,240 --> 04:30:19,240
But don't give in, you must feed it.

2405
04:30:19,240 --> 04:30:21,240
It is your mission.

2406
04:30:22,240 --> 04:30:24,240
Ugh!

2407
04:30:36,240 --> 04:30:39,240
We gotta defeat Metal, man.

2408
04:30:39,240 --> 04:30:43,240
Lolithia, what does it mean?

2409
04:30:43,240 --> 04:30:46,240
It's a mission for a Shaman.

2410
04:30:46,240 --> 04:30:52,240
No, my mission as Princess of Outerhide awaits me.

2411
04:30:58,240 --> 04:31:02,240
So in Japanese, it's so dark, okay.

2412
04:31:06,240 --> 04:31:08,240
It's not ogre?

2413
04:31:16,240 --> 04:31:26,240
It's so dark sounds much better than sure to dark.

2414
04:31:26,240 --> 04:31:28,240
Honestly, yeah, I think so too.

2415
04:31:28,240 --> 04:31:30,240
Welcome back, Cecilia.

2416
04:31:30,240 --> 04:31:33,240
Sister Mary, did you know?

2417
04:31:35,240 --> 04:31:39,240
Yes, I knew, I knew, I know everything.

2418
04:31:39,240 --> 04:31:43,240
I know that you're carrying something very heavy too.

2419
04:31:43,240 --> 04:31:51,240
Sister, I believe that you all have to face many trials if you are led by the teardrop.

2420
04:31:51,240 --> 04:31:56,240
The women of Outerhide, royal family, are born shamans.

2421
04:31:56,240 --> 04:32:00,240
Those who can commune with the guardians of this world.

2422
04:32:00,240 --> 04:32:04,240
And they are often faced with a hard and difficult path of destiny.

2423
04:32:04,240 --> 04:32:08,240
Yes, but even though I'm...

2424
04:32:08,240 --> 04:32:12,240
Yes, I know you are always trying to be strong.

2425
04:32:12,240 --> 04:32:15,240
No one can do your suffering for you,

2426
04:32:15,240 --> 04:32:20,240
but friends can most definitely help to lighten the load.

2427
04:32:20,240 --> 04:32:25,240
Cecilia, find friends who can share the burden of your destiny.

2428
04:32:25,240 --> 04:32:29,240
And perhaps you will reduce their burdens as well.

2429
04:32:29,240 --> 04:32:33,240
Friends, yes, you are right.

2430
04:32:33,240 --> 04:32:38,240
I am a princess of Outerhide.

2431
04:32:38,240 --> 04:32:45,240
Even if I consider them as friends, but they can do the same to consider me as theirs?

2432
04:32:45,240 --> 04:32:48,240
Please tell me, sister.

2433
04:32:48,240 --> 04:32:53,240
Is it even possible to find friends that would accept someone like me?

2434
04:32:53,240 --> 04:32:56,240
Well, we will see.

2435
04:32:56,240 --> 04:33:02,240
Friends are not something you make, but rather something you discover.

2436
04:33:02,240 --> 04:33:10,240
Your mother was born in Outerhide, and she was able to find wonderful friends here at the Karan Abbey.

2437
04:33:16,240 --> 04:33:18,240
She winked.

2438
04:33:24,240 --> 04:33:29,240
Always remember to smile and have faith in yourself.

2439
04:33:29,240 --> 04:33:34,240
Everyone else who knows you places their faith in you easily.

2440
04:33:36,240 --> 04:33:42,240
You are a princess of Outerhide, but first and foremost, you are your own person.

2441
04:33:42,240 --> 04:33:46,240
There are many dictates, there are many dictates and duties,

2442
04:33:46,240 --> 04:33:51,240
but in the end, you alone choose your life, you understand?

2443
04:33:51,240 --> 04:33:54,240
Yes, I think I'm ready.

2444
04:34:00,240 --> 04:34:03,240
Everyone?

2445
04:34:15,240 --> 04:34:20,240
I knew that you would have returned to Outerhide's castle when you turned 17 years old.

2446
04:34:20,240 --> 04:34:23,240
I didn't know it was today.

2447
04:34:23,240 --> 04:34:25,240
I'm sorry.

2448
04:34:26,240 --> 04:34:28,240
I'm sorry.

2449
04:34:28,240 --> 04:34:31,240
I was being absent-minded as usual.

2450
04:34:31,240 --> 04:34:34,240
Do you have to return so soon?

2451
04:34:41,240 --> 04:34:45,240
Well, even though you weren't here long, I'm glad I got to know you.

2452
04:34:45,240 --> 04:34:48,240
I'll miss you. We all will.

2453
04:34:49,240 --> 04:34:53,240
By Heating the Guardian's Call, she joins the Great Wheel of Destiny as it turns towards the unforeseeable future.

2454
04:34:53,240 --> 04:34:58,240
Everyone starts off by following, but eventually, there comes a time when everyone chooses their own path.

2455
04:34:59,240 --> 04:35:04,240
The path this girl chose by answering the Guardian's Call will be fraught with danger when she finds her way through.

2456
04:35:07,240 --> 04:35:10,240
They always go so fast!

2457
04:37:18,240 --> 04:37:21,240
I'm sorry.

2458
04:37:43,240 --> 04:37:46,240
Stop happening!

2459
04:37:49,240 --> 04:37:52,240
But that was cool.

2460
04:37:54,240 --> 04:38:00,240
You brought this trouble on us. We must get rid of him and bring peace back to the village.

2461
04:38:08,240 --> 04:38:15,240
Now I've seen the power on first hand. That horrible sound it makes is like the roar of legendary monsters.

2462
04:38:19,240 --> 04:38:27,240
If he caused the earthquake, he is too dangerous to stay here. If he did it, he must be punished.

2463
04:38:35,240 --> 04:38:41,240
I pity the bullet, but he is a wanderer. He doesn't live the way we do. Maybe he should move on.

2464
04:38:48,240 --> 04:38:51,240
He's just a little guy.

2465
04:38:57,240 --> 04:39:00,240
He's just a little guy.

2466
04:39:08,240 --> 04:39:11,240
I'll make a bomb.

2467
04:39:11,240 --> 04:39:14,240
I'm burning this house down!

2468
04:39:35,240 --> 04:39:38,240
Dang it.

2469
04:39:38,240 --> 04:39:41,240
Oh, dang it.

2470
04:39:43,240 --> 04:39:46,240
Well, that didn't work.

2471
04:39:48,240 --> 04:39:51,240
Bombs are okay, but gun is not.

2472
04:39:51,240 --> 04:39:54,240
Fuck this place.

2473
04:39:54,240 --> 04:39:59,240
Yeah, I'm burning your inn down. Fuck you. Wait, there's stuff here.

2474
04:39:59,240 --> 04:40:02,240
The world moves to the wilderness.

2475
04:40:02,240 --> 04:40:05,240
Sorry, I'm reading now.

2476
04:40:09,240 --> 04:40:18,240
How long our world became a wasteland? Long ago, our world filled Gaia was a world filled green.

2477
04:40:18,240 --> 04:40:25,240
Our world became a wasteland because of a great battle fought over a thousand years ago.

2478
04:40:25,240 --> 04:40:30,240
Destruction was done by alien invaders.

2479
04:40:30,240 --> 04:40:33,240
And we now call themans.

2480
04:40:33,240 --> 04:40:36,240
Wait a second.

2481
04:40:37,240 --> 04:40:41,240
Aliens.

2482
04:40:41,240 --> 04:40:47,240
Well, gosh darn it, I'll be damned. They were aliens.

2483
04:40:49,240 --> 04:41:00,240
Humans, Elos, Guardians, all the inhabitants of the world bandaged together and fought bravely in defense of Gaia.

2484
04:41:00,240 --> 04:41:05,240
There's gosh darn aliens stole my Cal Betsy.

2485
04:41:10,240 --> 04:41:16,240
Alas, the impact of the war was tremendous. Many, many people were killed.

2486
04:41:16,240 --> 04:41:19,240
Gaia itself was left in ruins.

2487
04:41:19,240 --> 04:41:25,240
A final battle and destructive power came into our hands. This power was armed.

2488
04:41:26,240 --> 04:41:30,240
It was said that this power originally came from the demons.

2489
04:41:33,240 --> 04:41:41,240
In the end, Gaia was victorious. But the price was steep. Thanks to Arm, the world lay in ruins.

2490
04:41:44,240 --> 04:41:53,240
Don't you love how I'm reading this dramatic thing and there's still a bomb about to go off in the background?

2491
04:41:55,240 --> 04:41:59,240
Hahaha.

2492
04:42:13,240 --> 04:42:17,240
It's like the bomb can wait.

2493
04:42:17,240 --> 04:42:25,840
The Guardians of Fogaya lost the power they once had to hold the world together.

2494
04:42:25,840 --> 04:42:31,280
The lu disappeared, no one knows where, and the humans, saddened by the devastation, see

2495
04:42:31,280 --> 04:42:36,800
away forever the destructive power of arm.

2496
04:42:36,800 --> 04:42:39,880
It had destroyed as much as it protected.

2497
04:42:39,880 --> 04:42:44,880
No one's flourishing civilisation of Fogaya was now lost.

2498
04:42:45,560 --> 04:42:52,280
Since the demon, Guardians, aloh and arm were hardly seen again, in Fogaya now.

2499
04:42:52,280 --> 04:42:55,280
It's but a barren wasteland.

2500
04:43:14,880 --> 04:43:19,880
The Guardians of Fogaya lost the power they once had to hold the world together.

2501
04:43:19,880 --> 04:43:24,880
The Guardians of Fogaya lost the power they once had to hold the world together.

2502
04:43:24,880 --> 04:43:29,880
The Guardians of Fogaya lost the power they once had to hold the world together.

2503
04:43:29,880 --> 04:43:34,880
The Guardians of Fogaya lost the power they once had to hold the world together.

2504
04:43:34,880 --> 04:43:40,880
The Guardians of Fogaya lost the power they once had to hold the world together.

2505
04:43:45,880 --> 04:43:47,880
Order! Order!

2506
04:43:47,880 --> 04:43:48,880
Okay, hold on.

2507
04:43:50,880 --> 04:43:52,880
That was pretty good timing, right?

2508
04:43:57,880 --> 04:43:59,880
Order! Order!

2509
04:44:00,880 --> 04:44:01,880
Order! Order!

2510
04:44:05,880 --> 04:44:07,880
The will of the majority is clear.

2511
04:44:07,880 --> 04:44:10,880
A boy is banished from the village.

2512
04:44:11,880 --> 04:44:17,880
Since I have taken responsibility for him, I will tell him of our decision.

2513
04:44:23,880 --> 04:44:28,880
That's it! That's the punishment! He tried to bring a monster down on us!

2514
04:44:28,880 --> 04:44:31,880
Wait, he tried to take a monster down on us!

2515
04:44:40,880 --> 04:44:44,880
Rudy, are you eavesdropping? It's alright.

2516
04:44:44,880 --> 04:44:49,880
The village has reached its decision. As soon as you're ready, he must leave Surf Village.

2517
04:44:54,880 --> 04:44:57,880
Homeowners Association hate!

2518
04:44:58,880 --> 04:45:00,880
Also, yeah, we killed that monster.

2519
04:45:03,880 --> 04:45:06,880
Head Foss, head Farsal.

2520
04:45:06,880 --> 04:45:11,880
Go to the other side of the mountains. Face in the sea, find a grove.

2521
04:45:11,880 --> 04:45:14,880
On the grove, find the Kingdom of Adahide.

2522
04:45:14,880 --> 04:45:21,880
So wanderer, you may find that a big city has more to offer you than a small lonely village on the frontier.

2523
04:45:33,880 --> 04:45:35,880
He's so sad!

2524
04:45:37,880 --> 04:45:41,880
We saved your kid, you're your kid.

2525
04:45:42,880 --> 04:45:50,880
We saved your kid, and we've defeated a demon, and now it's like, get out! Get!

2526
04:45:50,880 --> 04:45:57,880
And now they went, get! Get out of our village! We don't take kindly to your con!

2527
04:45:57,880 --> 04:46:02,880
Blue hair, anime protagonist.

2528
04:46:06,880 --> 04:46:08,880
I'm sorry.

2529
04:46:17,880 --> 04:46:19,880
Hey, okay.

2530
04:46:19,880 --> 04:46:21,880
Hey mister!

2531
04:46:25,880 --> 04:46:27,880
What's a dog doing?

2532
04:46:28,880 --> 04:46:36,880
You really helped me, but, but I couldn't help you.

2533
04:46:36,880 --> 04:46:41,880
I know you're a good person, no one listens to me though. I'm just a kid.

2534
04:46:41,880 --> 04:46:45,880
And life is a nightmare.

2535
04:46:49,880 --> 04:46:53,880
I, I wanted to at least say thank you.

2536
04:46:54,880 --> 04:46:58,880
Yeah, the dog lived!

2537
04:46:58,880 --> 04:47:05,880
Somebody wants to admit it to you, but everybody knows you saved my life.

2538
04:47:05,880 --> 04:47:11,880
I should go home now. Thanks again, Mr. Wanderer. I'll never forget you.

2539
04:47:11,880 --> 04:47:14,880
Do we get the fruit, Tim?

2540
04:47:24,880 --> 04:47:29,880
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

2541
04:47:33,880 --> 04:47:35,880
Hold on.

2542
04:47:38,880 --> 04:47:40,880
I literally cannot save.

2543
04:47:40,880 --> 04:47:42,880
Shoot!

2544
04:47:53,880 --> 04:48:06,880
What was the...

2545
04:48:06,880 --> 04:48:10,880
Right, I had to go do this.

2546
04:48:13,880 --> 04:48:16,880
The return of gun.

2547
04:48:18,880 --> 04:48:21,880
What the fuck are you? Rat monkey!

2548
04:48:24,880 --> 04:48:27,880
Gaggy sun.

2549
04:48:31,880 --> 04:48:34,880
I don't feel like those are rats.

2550
04:48:46,880 --> 04:48:50,880
I think you literally do not look like rats.

2551
04:48:51,880 --> 04:48:58,880
Maybe I can see sort of the monkey part because I just saw their bare butts.

2552
04:48:58,880 --> 04:49:05,880
Like, you see those butts? Very detailed. Very, very chimp-like.

2553
04:49:05,880 --> 04:49:08,880
What the fuck are you doing?

2554
04:49:18,880 --> 04:49:21,880
Why the cake?

2555
04:49:25,880 --> 04:49:27,880
Why?

2556
04:49:36,880 --> 04:49:40,880
I'm not gonna be able to find like a...

2557
04:49:47,880 --> 04:49:52,880
I'm not gonna be able to find things as easily.

2558
04:49:53,880 --> 04:49:55,880
Die!

2559
04:49:57,880 --> 04:50:01,880
I did take a primate study course.

2560
04:50:05,880 --> 04:50:10,880
I don't really have a favorite, like, primate.

2561
04:50:10,880 --> 04:50:17,880
But I felt kind of sad after coming out of that course.

2562
04:50:17,880 --> 04:50:26,880
Because I found out, like, at the end of the day, I found out that I had a primate study course.

2563
04:50:26,880 --> 04:50:30,880
I found out that I had a primate study course.

2564
04:50:30,880 --> 04:50:42,880
Because I found out, like, at the time, like, over 80% of all, like, primate populations have become extinct.

2565
04:50:42,880 --> 04:50:44,880
Like, species.

2566
04:50:44,880 --> 04:50:47,880
And that made me really sad.

2567
04:50:48,880 --> 04:50:50,880
Made me really sad.

2568
04:50:51,880 --> 04:50:53,880
I'm not bad.

2569
04:50:53,880 --> 04:50:56,880
Oh, we're cool. Oh, we're okay.

2570
04:50:59,880 --> 04:51:01,880
So that made me really sad.

2571
04:51:03,880 --> 04:51:08,880
And that was my take away, is that I was like, man, it sucks.

2572
04:51:08,880 --> 04:51:11,880
It sucks that, like, you know...

2573
04:51:12,880 --> 04:51:14,880
Is there anything here?

2574
04:51:18,880 --> 04:51:20,880
This is the weirdest tech.

2575
04:51:27,880 --> 04:51:29,880
I can't...

2576
04:51:29,880 --> 04:51:31,880
I can't...

2577
04:51:31,880 --> 04:51:32,880
I can't...

2578
04:51:32,880 --> 04:51:34,880
I can't...

2579
04:51:34,880 --> 04:51:35,880
I can't...

2580
04:51:35,880 --> 04:51:36,880
I can't...

2581
04:51:36,880 --> 04:51:37,880
I can't...

2582
04:51:37,880 --> 04:51:38,880
I can't...

2583
04:51:38,880 --> 04:51:39,880
I can't...

2584
04:51:40,880 --> 04:51:41,880
I can't...

2585
04:51:41,880 --> 04:51:42,880
She...

2586
04:51:42,880 --> 04:51:44,880
Here?

2587
04:51:49,880 --> 04:51:52,880
Oh, this music's great.

2588
04:52:03,880 --> 04:52:05,880
These are kinda like, lost.

2589
04:52:05,880 --> 04:52:07,880
Dude.

2590
04:52:09,880 --> 04:52:19,400
What the heck is this supposed to be?

2591
04:52:19,400 --> 04:52:20,800
Wait, condition sickness?

2592
04:52:20,800 --> 04:52:22,840
I hope it doesn't last.

2593
04:52:39,880 --> 04:52:54,280
Is there a place here?

2594
04:52:54,280 --> 04:53:00,000
Oh, come on!

2595
04:53:00,000 --> 04:53:05,160
I can't save until I see a guy, a little guy, you know?

2596
04:53:05,160 --> 04:53:30,160
A huge map.

2597
04:53:30,160 --> 04:53:32,120
Was it hard?

2598
04:53:32,120 --> 04:53:36,520
For the first game, did you just have to, like, run into place and be like, oh, I found

2599
04:53:36,520 --> 04:53:39,520
it?

2600
04:53:39,520 --> 04:53:44,240
Yeah, Gimmel coins can let you save at any time.

2601
04:53:44,240 --> 04:53:52,440
That's true, too, but aren't they kind of, like, precious?

2602
04:53:53,080 --> 04:54:18,680
I am too far.

2603
04:54:18,680 --> 04:54:34,120
I'm not healing in close battle?

2604
04:54:34,120 --> 04:54:37,160
The original locations were on the map in plain sight.

2605
04:54:37,160 --> 04:54:39,120
Why did they take that?

2606
04:54:39,120 --> 04:54:57,200
Why did they take that away from me?

2607
04:54:57,200 --> 04:55:03,200
What do these do?

2608
04:55:03,200 --> 04:55:09,200
I don't know what these do!

2609
04:55:09,200 --> 04:55:10,200
Medicine.

2610
04:55:10,200 --> 04:55:13,200
You mean because I'm sick?

2611
04:55:13,200 --> 04:55:18,200
Okay, I guess it does.

2612
04:55:18,200 --> 04:55:23,200
Oh, thank you.

2613
04:55:23,200 --> 04:55:33,200
Well, Kango did work.

2614
04:55:33,200 --> 04:55:48,200
I hate this mechanic right now.

2615
04:55:48,200 --> 04:55:58,200
Like, legit, do not like this mechanic.

2616
04:56:18,200 --> 04:56:43,200
Like, I don't like having to go close to too much work, man.

2617
04:56:43,200 --> 04:56:48,200
There's out a hide.

2618
04:56:48,200 --> 04:56:49,200
I'm lost.

2619
04:56:49,200 --> 04:57:12,200
I want a map.

2620
04:57:13,200 --> 04:57:28,200
Stink cloud, thanks.

2621
04:57:28,200 --> 04:57:40,200
I got a map you had to walk to the other forest.

2622
04:57:40,200 --> 04:57:45,200
Which forest?

2623
04:57:45,200 --> 04:57:48,200
This one?

2624
04:57:48,200 --> 04:58:01,200
This one.

2625
04:58:01,200 --> 04:58:07,200
There are trees here.

2626
04:58:08,200 --> 04:58:13,200
Where the fuck you go?

2627
04:58:13,200 --> 04:58:15,200
I'm not going to lie to you!

2628
04:58:15,200 --> 04:58:18,200
This is a dumb mechanic.

2629
04:58:18,200 --> 04:58:20,200
This is dumb.

2630
04:58:20,200 --> 04:58:24,200
Super dumb mechanic.

2631
04:58:24,200 --> 04:58:39,200
It literally had to materialize.

2632
04:58:39,200 --> 04:58:42,200
We literally walked through that, yeah.

2633
04:58:42,200 --> 04:58:48,200
Get out of my way!

2634
04:58:48,200 --> 04:58:49,200
We have an emergency.

2635
04:58:49,200 --> 04:58:51,200
There was an accident at the site.

2636
04:58:51,200 --> 04:58:52,200
Get out of control.

2637
04:58:52,200 --> 04:58:55,200
We need to let Emma know.

2638
04:58:55,200 --> 04:58:57,200
I don't know you guys.

2639
04:58:57,200 --> 04:59:12,200
You need to take me to the nearest hospital first.

2640
04:59:12,200 --> 04:59:14,200
I'm hungry.

2641
04:59:14,200 --> 04:59:17,200
There it is!

2642
04:59:17,200 --> 04:59:20,200
Hello, where are you?

2643
04:59:20,200 --> 04:59:21,200
Hello there!

2644
04:59:21,200 --> 04:59:24,200
Are you asking me to save your progress?

2645
04:59:24,200 --> 04:59:36,200
Yeah.

2646
04:59:36,200 --> 04:59:44,200
You are in Aldehi, a trading mecca with a truly sparkling culture.

2647
04:59:44,200 --> 04:59:49,200
You must be here for the ancient culture exhibition.

2648
04:59:49,200 --> 04:59:51,200
I find this town as lovely as I do.

2649
04:59:51,200 --> 05:00:01,200
Please feel free to look around.

2650
05:00:01,200 --> 05:00:04,200
Emma, come on.

2651
05:00:04,200 --> 05:00:06,200
Welcome, let me upgrade your arm!

2652
05:00:06,200 --> 05:00:28,200
Dr. Emma, even study is under me.

2653
05:00:28,200 --> 05:00:30,200
We do have a lot of money.

2654
05:00:30,200 --> 05:00:36,200
Should we do a DAC bonus?

2655
05:00:36,200 --> 05:00:38,200
Or more bullets?

2656
05:00:38,200 --> 05:00:43,200
I'm going to do more bullets.

2657
05:00:43,200 --> 05:00:45,200
I don't know what easiness is.

2658
05:00:45,200 --> 05:00:51,200
Tune's reflexes counter and equips auto-reload.

2659
05:00:51,200 --> 05:00:55,200
Amplified power when a critical hit occurs.

2660
05:00:55,200 --> 05:00:59,200
Increases shot accuracy.

2661
05:00:59,200 --> 05:01:05,200
Increases shot attacking power.

2662
05:01:05,200 --> 05:01:17,200
Is accuracy more important?

2663
05:01:17,200 --> 05:01:34,200
Is there a chance that I'll miss?

2664
05:01:34,200 --> 05:01:46,200
Haven't missed yet, but is there a chance I'll miss later?

2665
05:01:46,200 --> 05:01:50,200
Critical easiness?

2666
05:01:50,200 --> 05:01:52,200
I don't know.

2667
05:01:52,200 --> 05:01:56,200
The attack bonus sounds nice, but it's a lot of gala.

2668
05:01:56,200 --> 05:01:59,200
It's a lot of gala.

2669
05:01:59,200 --> 05:02:03,200
My name.

2670
05:02:03,200 --> 05:02:08,200
It's a lot of gala.

2671
05:02:08,200 --> 05:02:21,200
What the heck is this?

2672
05:02:21,200 --> 05:02:23,200
How may I help you?

2673
05:02:23,200 --> 05:02:27,200
Feel free to create magic as long as there's a spot on the crest graph.

2674
05:02:27,200 --> 05:02:28,200
Huh?

2675
05:02:28,200 --> 05:02:34,200
I'm sorry, I'm afraid you're not allowed to create any magic without a crest sorcerer.

2676
05:02:34,200 --> 05:02:44,200
Alright.

2677
05:02:44,200 --> 05:02:47,200
Welcome, please take a look around.

2678
05:02:47,200 --> 05:02:49,200
Oh, it's got medicine here.

2679
05:02:49,200 --> 05:02:50,200
I'm good.

2680
05:02:50,200 --> 05:02:51,200
Bye-bye.

2681
05:02:51,200 --> 05:02:53,200
We'll see you soon.

2682
05:02:53,200 --> 05:02:58,200
I headcanon everyone here.

2683
05:02:58,200 --> 05:03:03,200
Everyone here has an accent.

2684
05:03:03,200 --> 05:03:04,200
Come on.

2685
05:03:04,200 --> 05:03:07,200
Yep, we can see.

2686
05:03:07,200 --> 05:03:09,200
Antique shelf.

2687
05:03:09,200 --> 05:03:11,200
Li-well.

2688
05:03:11,200 --> 05:03:20,200
Organized small machine parts of his Darko's significance.

2689
05:03:20,200 --> 05:03:33,200
Okay.

2690
05:03:33,200 --> 05:03:35,200
Can I go into here?

2691
05:03:35,200 --> 05:03:41,200
Can I just go into people's buildings?

2692
05:03:41,200 --> 05:03:47,200
The poster shows out a hide from a bird's eye view.

2693
05:03:47,200 --> 05:03:49,200
Oh, hey, is that the princess?

2694
05:03:49,200 --> 05:03:51,200
The princess!

2695
05:03:51,200 --> 05:03:53,200
You look like a wanderer.

2696
05:03:53,200 --> 05:03:56,200
That's exciting to be able to travel so freely.

2697
05:03:56,200 --> 05:04:01,200
H bird can only look up at the sky and admire your strong wings.

2698
05:04:01,200 --> 05:04:03,200
Fish, why?

2699
05:04:03,200 --> 05:04:09,200
Fish, why are you like giving me poetry?

2700
05:04:09,200 --> 05:04:10,200
Welcome.

2701
05:04:10,200 --> 05:04:12,200
Welcome, you will.

2702
05:04:12,200 --> 05:04:16,200
You will enjoy our cozy room

2703
05:04:16,200 --> 05:04:19,200
and our exceptional complimentary soup.

2704
05:04:19,200 --> 05:04:27,200
Soup!

2705
05:04:27,200 --> 05:04:29,200
Thank you for staying with us.

2706
05:04:29,200 --> 05:04:32,200
Now, meet 35 Geluf, all of you.

2707
05:04:32,200 --> 05:04:43,200
No.

2708
05:04:43,200 --> 05:04:45,200
Am I saying soup weird, Senpai?

2709
05:04:45,200 --> 05:04:52,200
I don't think so.

2710
05:04:52,200 --> 05:04:54,200
This town is huge, almost too huge,

2711
05:04:54,200 --> 05:04:56,200
but I figured there'll be a job for me.

2712
05:04:56,200 --> 05:04:58,200
I could not have been more wrong.

2713
05:04:58,200 --> 05:05:02,200
The only job I have for me is to dig around the ruins.

2714
05:05:02,200 --> 05:05:06,200
Do you think a wanderer wants to dig around the ruins?

2715
05:05:06,200 --> 05:05:08,200
Oh, you're a wanderer too.

2716
05:05:08,200 --> 05:05:28,200
Ah, shucks.

2717
05:05:28,200 --> 05:05:32,200
They always give me the ability to go on the balcony,

2718
05:05:32,200 --> 05:05:48,200
but there's nothing on the balcony.

2719
05:05:48,200 --> 05:05:50,200
This game loves it.

2720
05:05:50,200 --> 05:05:52,200
Sorry.

2721
05:05:52,200 --> 05:06:08,200
Empty balcony.

2722
05:06:08,200 --> 05:06:13,200
Done.

2723
05:06:13,200 --> 05:06:17,200
You know that the ancient cultural exhibition is opening soon?

2724
05:06:17,200 --> 05:06:18,200
Can't wait.

2725
05:06:18,200 --> 05:06:21,200
I've been saving my allowance for a long time for this.

2726
05:06:21,200 --> 05:06:23,200
I got this cute purse for my grandma.

2727
05:06:23,200 --> 05:06:26,200
It goes around my neck, so I won't lose my money.

2728
05:06:26,200 --> 05:06:41,200
That is really sweet and cute.

2729
05:06:42,200 --> 05:06:45,200
Anything?

2730
05:06:45,200 --> 05:06:47,200
I feel...

2731
05:06:47,200 --> 05:06:50,200
Is there anything cool?

2732
05:06:50,200 --> 05:06:52,200
No.

2733
05:06:52,200 --> 05:06:56,200
You have all these hidden areas,

2734
05:06:56,200 --> 05:07:05,200
but there's like nothing.

2735
05:07:05,200 --> 05:07:07,200
Not a safe way to hold on to money though.

2736
05:07:07,200 --> 05:07:09,200
Yeah, probably.

2737
05:07:10,200 --> 05:07:13,200
Here lies the tombstone of Selduks.

2738
05:07:13,200 --> 05:07:15,200
This guardian protected the castle

2739
05:07:15,200 --> 05:07:22,200
and symbolizes defense and stability.

2740
05:07:22,200 --> 05:07:26,200
Like, kinda looks like wasted,

2741
05:07:26,200 --> 05:07:28,200
wasted, like, map room, right?

2742
05:07:28,200 --> 05:07:36,200
It's okay.

2743
05:07:37,200 --> 05:07:42,200
Okay.

2744
05:07:42,200 --> 05:07:44,200
A boy with an arm.

2745
05:07:44,200 --> 05:07:47,200
I tend to grow suspicious when I hear the word arm.

2746
05:07:47,200 --> 05:07:52,200
I heard there are people who specialize in the profession of arm modification.

2747
05:07:52,200 --> 05:07:54,200
I think they're called Armmeister.

2748
05:07:54,200 --> 05:07:56,200
Armmeister?

2749
05:07:56,200 --> 05:08:03,200
Snowmeister, hee, meister.

2750
05:08:03,200 --> 05:08:05,200
We all have arms.

2751
05:08:05,200 --> 05:08:07,200
In fact, that's true.

2752
05:08:07,200 --> 05:08:10,200
Well, some of us might not have arms,

2753
05:08:10,200 --> 05:08:17,200
and some of us might have one arm.

2754
05:08:17,200 --> 05:08:19,200
From what I hear, they're always busy.

2755
05:08:19,200 --> 05:08:22,200
It's not just keeping myself too busy all the time.

2756
05:08:22,200 --> 05:08:26,200
I don't know how anyone can be so passionate.

2757
05:08:26,200 --> 05:08:29,200
Wait a second.

2758
05:08:29,200 --> 05:08:33,200
We get kicked out of the small village

2759
05:08:33,200 --> 05:08:36,200
because we own an arm,

2760
05:08:36,200 --> 05:08:41,200
but it's, like, common in this world?

2761
05:08:51,200 --> 05:08:58,200
What?

2762
05:08:58,200 --> 05:08:59,200
It's hair.

2763
05:08:59,200 --> 05:09:00,200
I knew it.

2764
05:09:00,200 --> 05:09:01,200
I knew it.

2765
05:09:01,200 --> 05:09:05,200
It's like, we don't take kindly to your kind around here,

2766
05:09:05,200 --> 05:09:10,200
specifically anime protagonist blue hair.

2767
05:09:10,200 --> 05:09:12,200
I just wanted to reason to kick us out.

2768
05:09:12,200 --> 05:09:13,200
I know, right?

2769
05:09:13,200 --> 05:09:17,200
So rude.

2770
05:09:17,200 --> 05:09:19,200
My husband has been saying all along,

2771
05:09:19,200 --> 05:09:22,200
we shouldn't let our guard down because monsters are lurking in the shadows

2772
05:09:22,200 --> 05:09:24,200
just waiting for a chance to attack.

2773
05:09:24,200 --> 05:09:26,200
I just don't think it's wise.

2774
05:09:26,200 --> 05:09:30,200
This time I have an exhibition of our town.

2775
05:09:30,200 --> 05:09:33,200
It just got me a little worried.

2776
05:09:33,200 --> 05:09:36,200
Why don't we have secret spots?

2777
05:09:36,200 --> 05:09:40,200
Why don't we have spots that look like they would go to cool places

2778
05:09:40,200 --> 05:09:47,200
and have squashed up, but they don't.

2779
05:09:47,200 --> 05:09:48,200
I worry a lot.

2780
05:09:48,200 --> 05:09:50,200
It's the nature of my profession.

2781
05:09:50,200 --> 05:09:52,200
My wife doesn't like it, though.

2782
05:09:52,200 --> 05:09:53,200
Every time I raise any concern,

2783
05:09:53,200 --> 05:09:57,200
she tells me to zip it before I can even finish my sentence.

2784
05:09:58,200 --> 05:10:02,200
The title is,

2785
05:10:02,200 --> 05:10:04,200
book is titled The Two Moons.

2786
05:10:04,200 --> 05:10:05,200
Do you want to read it?

2787
05:10:05,200 --> 05:10:06,200
Yeah.

2788
05:10:20,200 --> 05:10:23,200
It is nothing new for the people in Phil Gaia

2789
05:10:23,200 --> 05:10:27,200
to see two shining moons in the cloudless night sky.

2790
05:10:27,200 --> 05:10:30,200
A tale would have had, would have it,

2791
05:10:30,200 --> 05:10:34,200
that one of the moons was created by humans 1,000 years ago.

2792
05:10:34,200 --> 05:10:40,200
Wait, we got fake moons and time is made by machines?

2793
05:10:40,200 --> 05:10:44,200
What?

2794
05:10:47,200 --> 05:10:50,200
People call the old moon, old moon,

2795
05:10:50,200 --> 05:10:55,200
and the man-made moon, new moon.

2796
05:10:55,200 --> 05:10:58,200
This world building is wild, yeah.

2797
05:10:58,200 --> 05:11:00,200
A thousand years ago,

2798
05:11:00,200 --> 05:11:04,200
it's not only marked as the period of great war,

2799
05:11:04,200 --> 05:11:14,200
but also as the period of great progress in technology.

2800
05:11:14,200 --> 05:11:17,200
It was the age when no one wondered

2801
05:11:17,200 --> 05:11:22,200
how humans were able to create another moon in the sea of stars.

2802
05:11:22,200 --> 05:11:25,200
We can only lament at the sad,

2803
05:11:25,200 --> 05:11:27,200
at the sad fact that modern men are unable

2804
05:11:27,200 --> 05:11:31,200
to verify the authenticity of this tale.

2805
05:11:35,200 --> 05:11:38,200
I think I'm getting eepy some pie.

2806
05:11:38,200 --> 05:11:40,200
Inscription reads,

2807
05:11:40,200 --> 05:11:43,200
to commemorate the new,

2808
05:11:43,200 --> 05:11:46,200
the inauguration of the new out-of-hide mayor.

2809
05:11:57,200 --> 05:12:00,200
It's a little wild, right?

2810
05:12:00,200 --> 05:12:03,200
Oh, this must be the castle.

2811
05:12:03,200 --> 05:12:09,200
Only, only the exhibition staff is allowed in this point,

2812
05:12:09,200 --> 05:12:12,200
in at this point, sorry for the inconvenience.

2813
05:12:12,200 --> 05:12:15,200
Okay, well, this place is.

2814
05:12:16,200 --> 05:12:19,200
Oh, it is like, yeah.

2815
05:12:19,200 --> 05:12:22,200
Hold on, let me save then.

2816
05:12:22,200 --> 05:12:44,200
I think I want to wrap it up soon.

2817
05:12:44,200 --> 05:12:47,200
It's good that we got to another place,

2818
05:12:47,200 --> 05:12:50,200
so let's go on like this half

2819
05:12:50,200 --> 05:12:52,200
before we go into like the castle,

2820
05:12:52,200 --> 05:12:56,200
and then that's it for today, I think.

2821
05:12:56,200 --> 05:12:59,200
I think we're doing, the prologue is pretty good.

2822
05:12:59,200 --> 05:13:03,200
Um, it's funny that we only,

2823
05:13:03,200 --> 05:13:05,200
we only completed the prologue,

2824
05:13:05,200 --> 05:13:08,200
and then after the prologue would be,

2825
05:13:08,200 --> 05:13:11,200
we would complete the, um,

2826
05:13:11,200 --> 05:13:13,200
I'm assuming they go by chapters?

2827
05:13:13,200 --> 05:13:16,200
Yeah.

2828
05:13:16,200 --> 05:13:19,200
Oh, let me talk, let me talk.

2829
05:13:19,200 --> 05:13:22,200
I just saw a traveling knight enter,

2830
05:13:22,200 --> 05:13:24,200
enter out of Hyde Castle.

2831
05:13:24,200 --> 05:13:26,200
You think he's here to apply for a security job

2832
05:13:26,200 --> 05:13:29,200
at the Ancient Culture Exhibition?

2833
05:13:35,200 --> 05:13:36,200
It was a pretty long prologue,

2834
05:13:36,200 --> 05:13:40,200
but it's not like I minded too much.

2835
05:13:40,200 --> 05:13:42,200
Oh, book.

2836
05:13:42,200 --> 05:13:45,200
There has not been many patients here lately.

2837
05:13:45,200 --> 05:13:46,200
Thanks to Ferguson,

2838
05:13:46,200 --> 05:13:51,200
I can actually use some of this equipment.

2839
05:13:51,200 --> 05:13:53,200
Book.

2840
05:13:53,200 --> 05:13:56,200
I don't, anyone can be stronger.

2841
05:13:56,200 --> 05:14:00,200
We need this book, Senpai.

2842
05:14:00,200 --> 05:14:02,200
How can I become stronger?

2843
05:14:02,200 --> 05:14:04,200
Is it by remaining righteous?

2844
05:14:04,200 --> 05:14:06,200
No, I don't think so.

2845
05:14:06,200 --> 05:14:08,200
If you increase your numbers,

2846
05:14:08,200 --> 05:14:10,200
you will become stronger in no time.

2847
05:14:10,200 --> 05:14:13,200
In other words, form a faction.

2848
05:14:13,200 --> 05:14:15,200
Don't get down is very effective,

2849
05:14:15,200 --> 05:14:17,200
and the quickest way.

2850
05:14:17,200 --> 05:14:19,200
A faction, or call it a party.

2851
05:14:19,200 --> 05:14:22,200
Aw, man.

2852
05:14:22,200 --> 05:14:24,200
Once a party is formed,

2853
05:14:24,200 --> 05:14:26,200
you are immediately stronger

2854
05:14:26,200 --> 05:14:28,200
with the combined traits of each member.

2855
05:14:28,200 --> 05:14:30,200
This guy has such a great punch.

2856
05:14:30,200 --> 05:14:32,200
That guy is popular with the ladies.

2857
05:14:32,200 --> 05:14:35,200
That guy's relative is an influential politician.

2858
05:14:35,200 --> 05:14:37,200
Anything goes.

2859
05:14:37,200 --> 05:14:40,200
It's very important to respect everyone's unique power.

2860
05:14:40,200 --> 05:14:42,200
A strong party understands each other.

2861
05:14:42,200 --> 05:14:44,200
Yes, I like what I just said.

2862
05:14:44,200 --> 05:14:46,200
Well, I'm on a roll.

2863
05:14:46,200 --> 05:14:48,200
I'm going to add one more thing.

2864
05:14:48,200 --> 05:14:50,200
To understand each other also means

2865
05:14:50,200 --> 05:14:52,200
to be accepting of one's flaws,

2866
05:14:52,200 --> 05:14:54,200
as well as one's good traits.

2867
05:14:54,200 --> 05:14:56,200
I would even recommend having each other,

2868
05:14:56,200 --> 05:14:58,200
each member anonymously write down

2869
05:14:58,200 --> 05:15:01,200
their flaws and openly discuss it afterwards.

2870
05:15:01,200 --> 05:15:03,200
Find that there is an abundance of words

2871
05:15:03,200 --> 05:15:05,200
to describe flaws.

2872
05:15:05,200 --> 05:15:07,200
Be an ugly discussion for sure.

2873
05:15:07,200 --> 05:15:09,200
Be angry people.

2874
05:15:09,200 --> 05:15:11,200
Anger can make one stronger,

2875
05:15:11,200 --> 05:15:13,200
especially for those who want to get strong quickly.

2876
05:15:14,200 --> 05:15:16,200
I see.

2877
05:15:16,200 --> 05:15:18,200
You have learned that

2878
05:15:18,200 --> 05:15:20,200
spite and anger

2879
05:15:21,200 --> 05:15:23,200
makes you stronger.

2880
05:15:28,200 --> 05:15:30,200
I'm starting to see more

2881
05:15:30,200 --> 05:15:32,200
small scratches on my body.

2882
05:15:32,200 --> 05:15:34,200
I'm starting not to

2883
05:15:34,200 --> 05:15:36,200
trust this nun.

2884
05:15:36,200 --> 05:15:38,200
I feel like I'm better off without any of her treatments.

2885
05:15:38,200 --> 05:15:40,200
Wait, what?

2886
05:15:46,200 --> 05:15:48,200
What have you been doing?

2887
05:16:04,200 --> 05:16:06,200
Oh my gosh.

2888
05:16:06,200 --> 05:16:08,200
It's like shady.

2889
05:16:17,200 --> 05:16:19,200
What if I start walking in?

2890
05:16:22,200 --> 05:16:24,200
Why did nobody stop me?

2891
05:16:28,200 --> 05:16:30,200
What the hell?

2892
05:16:37,200 --> 05:16:39,200
Okay.

2893
05:16:39,200 --> 05:16:41,200
This one I can go through.

2894
05:16:41,200 --> 05:16:43,200
Out of hide castles, open up.

2895
05:16:43,200 --> 05:16:45,200
Anyone who wants to visit, that means you too.

2896
05:16:45,200 --> 05:16:47,200
The king's belief in democracy

2897
05:16:47,200 --> 05:16:49,200
over dictatorship shall be phrased.

2898
05:16:52,200 --> 05:16:54,200
Okay, well, we're good.

2899
05:16:55,200 --> 05:16:57,200
His name is Cougar.

2900
05:17:06,200 --> 05:17:08,200
Oh, this looks real needle.

2901
05:17:08,200 --> 05:17:10,200
Look at that.

2902
05:17:12,200 --> 05:17:14,200
I'm a little dizzy, though,

2903
05:17:14,200 --> 05:17:16,200
from this angle.

2904
05:17:17,200 --> 05:17:19,200
Sometimes you will see people

2905
05:17:19,200 --> 05:17:21,200
getting lost in this huge castle.

2906
05:17:21,200 --> 05:17:23,200
That's why the audience chamber

2907
05:17:23,200 --> 05:17:25,200
is located in the front of the entrance.

2908
05:17:26,200 --> 05:17:28,200
Though you appear to be younger than me,

2909
05:17:28,200 --> 05:17:30,200
you must have seen five times as many towns

2910
05:17:30,200 --> 05:17:32,200
as I ever have.

2911
05:17:32,200 --> 05:17:34,200
I'm envious to say the least. Just not right.

2912
05:17:34,200 --> 05:17:36,200
I mean, I know one hundred,

2913
05:17:36,200 --> 05:17:38,200
one thousand five hundred times

2914
05:17:38,200 --> 05:17:40,200
more about the castle,

2915
05:17:40,200 --> 05:17:42,200
but I bet you're not even slightly envious of me.

2916
05:17:43,200 --> 05:17:45,200
There.

2917
05:17:52,200 --> 05:17:54,200
What's up, biatch?

2918
05:18:04,200 --> 05:18:06,200
Mercy, that's the king.

2919
05:18:06,200 --> 05:18:08,200
I know.

2920
05:18:12,200 --> 05:18:14,200
I know.

2921
05:18:20,200 --> 05:18:22,200
This is a democracy, right?

2922
05:18:28,200 --> 05:18:30,200
This is a democracy, right?

2923
05:18:30,200 --> 05:18:32,200
This is a democracy, right?

2924
05:18:32,200 --> 05:18:34,200
This is a democracy, right?

2925
05:18:36,200 --> 05:18:38,200
With your help,

2926
05:18:38,200 --> 05:18:40,200
the Ancient Culture Exhibition Exhibition.

2927
05:18:44,200 --> 05:18:46,200
It could be a huge success.

2928
05:18:46,200 --> 05:18:48,200
I speak for all of Audehide.

2929
05:18:48,200 --> 05:18:50,200
When I say, your help is greatly appreciated.

2930
05:18:54,200 --> 05:18:56,200
Let me talk.

2931
05:18:56,200 --> 05:18:58,200
Let me talk.

2932
05:18:58,200 --> 05:19:00,200
A legend you'll find

2933
05:19:00,200 --> 05:19:02,200
will go a long way towards

2934
05:19:02,200 --> 05:19:04,200
making this kind of tree prosperous.

2935
05:19:04,200 --> 05:19:06,200
Wanderers will be keeping an eye

2936
05:19:06,200 --> 05:19:08,200
on your progress.

2937
05:19:12,200 --> 05:19:14,200
Can we talk?

2938
05:19:14,200 --> 05:19:16,200
Are you here for deco?

2939
05:19:16,200 --> 05:19:18,200
Yes, though I have earned the right

2940
05:19:18,200 --> 05:19:20,200
to be his majesty's bodyguard.

2941
05:19:22,200 --> 05:19:24,200
Ever since I was a child,

2942
05:19:24,200 --> 05:19:26,200
I always wanted to wear Gar's uniform.

2943
05:19:26,200 --> 05:19:28,200
Just when I became a guard,

2944
05:19:28,200 --> 05:19:30,200
I was eliminated to cut down on expenses.

2945
05:19:30,200 --> 05:19:32,200
Wow.

2946
05:19:32,200 --> 05:19:34,200
That sucks.

2947
05:19:38,200 --> 05:19:40,200
Only the elite can be an Audehide knight.

2948
05:19:42,200 --> 05:19:44,200
We would willingly sacrifice our lives

2949
05:19:44,200 --> 05:19:46,200
for his majesty.

2950
05:19:46,200 --> 05:19:48,200
Pledge our loyalty only to King Justin.

2951
05:19:54,200 --> 05:19:56,200
I didn't expect that to be a name.

2952
05:19:58,200 --> 05:20:00,200
Like, that is...

2953
05:20:00,200 --> 05:20:02,200
I don't know.

2954
05:20:02,200 --> 05:20:04,200
Senpai, Justin is not really

2955
05:20:04,200 --> 05:20:06,200
a kingly name, right?

2956
05:20:12,200 --> 05:20:14,200
It's not really a kingly name,

2957
05:20:14,200 --> 05:20:16,200
is it?

2958
05:20:20,200 --> 05:20:22,200
So, I knew statues,

2959
05:20:22,200 --> 05:20:24,200
but they were not fixed or stabilized.

2960
05:20:24,200 --> 05:20:26,200
I added him for that. Perhaps I was too harsh on him

2961
05:20:26,200 --> 05:20:28,200
because he's not here now.

2962
05:20:28,200 --> 05:20:30,200
I don't understand young people.

2963
05:20:38,200 --> 05:20:40,200
Short for King Justin...

2964
05:20:40,200 --> 05:20:42,200
Justinian.

2965
05:20:48,200 --> 05:20:50,200
I think Justinian would be better.

2966
05:20:50,200 --> 05:20:52,200
Yeah.

2967
05:20:52,200 --> 05:20:54,200
But like, Justin is, you know...

2968
05:20:56,200 --> 05:20:58,200
Justin just doesn't seem...

2969
05:20:58,200 --> 05:21:00,200
Kingly.

2970
05:21:08,200 --> 05:21:10,200
Uh, Justin Saiyan.

2971
05:21:26,200 --> 05:21:28,200
What the heck is this?

2972
05:21:48,200 --> 05:21:50,200
Just incredible. Amazing.

2973
05:21:56,200 --> 05:21:58,200
I don't know if it's

2974
05:21:58,200 --> 05:22:00,200
Adelhide?

2975
05:22:00,200 --> 05:22:02,200
Or...

2976
05:22:02,200 --> 05:22:04,200
Adelhide?

2977
05:22:04,200 --> 05:22:06,200
Or...

2978
05:22:06,200 --> 05:22:08,200
Whatever, hide.

2979
05:22:22,200 --> 05:22:24,200
I want to say...

2980
05:22:24,200 --> 05:22:26,200
I was saying Adelhide, right?

2981
05:22:34,200 --> 05:22:36,200
Probably like Lado, like...

2982
05:22:36,200 --> 05:22:38,200
Adel?

2983
05:22:50,200 --> 05:22:52,200
I always said...

2984
05:22:52,200 --> 05:22:54,200
Adel, like Lado too.

2985
05:23:04,200 --> 05:23:06,200
Bitch, I'm coming in!

2986
05:23:10,200 --> 05:23:12,200
Imagine.

2987
05:23:12,200 --> 05:23:14,200
Fuck.

2988
05:23:20,200 --> 05:23:22,200
Literally.

2989
05:23:22,200 --> 05:23:24,200
Literally, just like...

2990
05:23:24,200 --> 05:23:26,200
Somebody was coming!

2991
05:23:42,200 --> 05:23:44,200
I am the worst.

2992
05:24:12,200 --> 05:24:14,200
You know she felt me.

2993
05:24:14,200 --> 05:24:16,200
Wait!

2994
05:24:20,200 --> 05:24:22,200
That's a fake door!

2995
05:24:26,200 --> 05:24:28,200
That's fucking rude.

2996
05:24:42,200 --> 05:24:44,200
This is the soldier...

2997
05:24:44,200 --> 05:24:46,200
This is the soldier's quarters.

2998
05:24:46,200 --> 05:24:48,200
If you don't mind, you have to excuse us.

2999
05:24:48,200 --> 05:24:50,200
There are things in here I do not wish

3000
05:24:50,200 --> 05:24:52,200
any lady to see.

3001
05:24:52,200 --> 05:24:54,200
Any lady?

3002
05:24:56,200 --> 05:24:58,200
Title...

3003
05:24:58,200 --> 05:25:00,200
Troll control.

3004
05:25:00,200 --> 05:25:02,200
Oi, mods!

3005
05:25:02,200 --> 05:25:04,200
Take notes!

3006
05:25:12,200 --> 05:25:14,200
I appreciate you, mods.

3007
05:25:14,200 --> 05:25:16,200
Let's take notes.

3008
05:25:16,200 --> 05:25:18,200
A large monster known as Troll

3009
05:25:20,200 --> 05:25:22,200
lives in dark mountains

3010
05:25:22,200 --> 05:25:24,200
shrouded in darkness.

3011
05:25:24,200 --> 05:25:26,200
The troll has

3012
05:25:26,200 --> 05:25:28,200
mass of physical strength

3013
05:25:28,200 --> 05:25:30,200
and great survival skill.

3014
05:25:30,200 --> 05:25:32,200
The following information

3015
05:25:32,200 --> 05:25:34,200
is what you should know

3016
05:25:34,200 --> 05:25:36,200
about the Troll control.

3017
05:25:36,200 --> 05:25:38,200
If you are skilled,

3018
05:25:38,200 --> 05:25:40,200
feel free to fight it.

3019
05:25:40,200 --> 05:25:42,200
Because if the troll's life

3020
05:25:42,200 --> 05:25:44,200
in darkness,

3021
05:25:44,200 --> 05:25:46,200
it will fear light.

3022
05:25:46,200 --> 05:25:48,200
One flash may lead to victory.

3023
05:25:52,200 --> 05:25:54,200
Another known as Troll control.

3024
05:25:54,200 --> 05:25:56,200
The Troll control.

3025
05:25:56,200 --> 05:25:58,200
The Troll control.

3026
05:25:58,200 --> 05:26:00,200
The Troll control.

3027
05:26:00,200 --> 05:26:02,200
The Troll control.

3028
05:26:02,200 --> 05:26:04,200
The Troll control.

3029
05:26:04,200 --> 05:26:06,200
Another known fact

3030
05:26:06,200 --> 05:26:08,200
is that the troll is cautious

3031
05:26:08,200 --> 05:26:10,200
and careful.

3032
05:26:10,200 --> 05:26:12,200
Unless provoked, the troll will not attack.

3033
05:26:12,200 --> 05:26:14,200
I think that's a lie.

3034
05:26:16,200 --> 05:26:18,200
Therefore, if you are not a skilled fighter

3035
05:26:18,200 --> 05:26:20,200
it will be wise to leave the troll room.

3036
05:26:20,200 --> 05:26:22,200
Never mind! Do not listen!

3037
05:26:22,200 --> 05:26:24,200
Never mind! Do not listen

3038
05:26:24,200 --> 05:26:26,200
to this!

3039
05:26:28,200 --> 05:26:30,200
Never mind! Do not listen

3040
05:26:30,200 --> 05:26:32,200
to this!

3041
05:26:32,200 --> 05:26:34,200
Do not listen to this!

3042
05:27:02,200 --> 05:27:04,200
No! That was terrible!

3043
05:27:06,200 --> 05:27:08,200
That was terrible advice!

3044
05:27:08,200 --> 05:27:10,200
What the hell?

3045
05:27:12,200 --> 05:27:14,200
Anatomy of the Demon.

3046
05:27:16,200 --> 05:27:18,200
Moderators, I'm sorry.

3047
05:27:18,200 --> 05:27:20,200
I'm sorry. Please continue

3048
05:27:20,200 --> 05:27:22,200
to do what you keep doing best.

3049
05:27:22,200 --> 05:27:24,200
I clearly this game knows nothing

3050
05:27:24,200 --> 05:27:26,200
and you know better.

3051
05:27:32,200 --> 05:27:34,200
No!

3052
05:27:54,200 --> 05:27:56,200
With their cold, solid steel bodies.

3053
05:27:58,200 --> 05:28:00,200
Steel!

3054
05:28:02,200 --> 05:28:04,200
Steel!

3055
05:28:06,200 --> 05:28:08,200
Steel!

3056
05:28:08,200 --> 05:28:10,200
The alien invaders are known

3057
05:28:10,200 --> 05:28:12,200
as demons.

3058
05:28:14,200 --> 05:28:16,200
Are they living metal then?

3059
05:28:16,200 --> 05:28:18,200
These like...

3060
05:28:18,200 --> 05:28:20,200
Aliens?

3061
05:28:20,200 --> 05:28:22,200
Are they robots?

3062
05:28:24,200 --> 05:28:26,200
From the outside, they look like monsters

3063
05:28:26,200 --> 05:28:28,200
but their inside anatomy

3064
05:28:28,200 --> 05:28:30,200
closely resembles that

3065
05:28:30,200 --> 05:28:32,200
of people in Fogaya.

3066
05:28:34,200 --> 05:28:36,200
They are constructed

3067
05:28:36,200 --> 05:28:38,200
of different materials than the human body

3068
05:28:38,200 --> 05:28:40,200
but their internal systems

3069
05:28:40,200 --> 05:28:42,200
operate much the same way.

3070
05:28:42,200 --> 05:28:44,200
They're people?

3071
05:28:44,200 --> 05:28:46,200
They're robot people?

3072
05:28:48,200 --> 05:28:50,200
They are aliens,

3073
05:28:50,200 --> 05:28:52,200
demons, and

3074
05:28:52,200 --> 05:28:54,200
robots?

3075
05:28:56,200 --> 05:28:58,200
A prehistoric alchemist

3076
05:28:58,200 --> 05:29:00,200
attempted to obtain demon power

3077
05:29:00,200 --> 05:29:02,200
by conducting a series

3078
05:29:02,200 --> 05:29:04,200
of experiments on a captured demon.

3079
05:29:06,200 --> 05:29:08,200
The alchemist's process

3080
05:29:08,200 --> 05:29:10,200
and action seemed very

3081
05:29:10,200 --> 05:29:12,200
eccentric now but the world was

3082
05:29:12,200 --> 05:29:14,200
in a constant state of war.

3083
05:29:14,200 --> 05:29:16,200
From the demon,

3084
05:29:16,200 --> 05:29:18,200
the alchemist created a newly

3085
05:29:18,200 --> 05:29:20,200
living organism he called

3086
05:29:20,200 --> 05:29:22,200
a golem.

3087
05:29:24,200 --> 05:29:26,200
Alas, the golem was merely a prototype

3088
05:29:26,200 --> 05:29:28,200
of the nightmare the alchemist

3089
05:29:28,200 --> 05:29:30,200
eventually created.

3090
05:29:36,200 --> 05:29:38,200
The lore is wild!

3091
05:29:38,200 --> 05:29:40,200
I kind of like it, you know?

3092
05:29:40,200 --> 05:29:42,200
So, what have you been hiding?

3093
05:29:44,200 --> 05:29:46,200
So, what have you been hiding?

3094
05:29:48,200 --> 05:29:50,200
Are you looking at naughty things?

3095
05:29:50,200 --> 05:29:52,200
Did you hide it under your mattress?

3096
05:29:56,200 --> 05:29:58,200
Where do you hide it?

3097
05:30:00,200 --> 05:30:02,200
Where do you hide it, senpai?

3098
05:30:18,200 --> 05:30:20,200
It's a secret?

3099
05:30:20,200 --> 05:30:22,200
Oh, I keep it in the open?

3100
05:30:26,200 --> 05:30:28,200
Is this a trick question?

3101
05:30:38,200 --> 05:30:40,200
Nothing too hide, I have to hide

3102
05:30:40,200 --> 05:30:42,200
my stuff, obviously.

3103
05:30:42,200 --> 05:30:44,200
Your FB is your spirit.

3104
05:30:44,200 --> 05:30:46,200
You can only be increased

3105
05:30:46,200 --> 05:30:48,200
with your experiences in battle.

3106
05:30:48,200 --> 05:30:50,200
I believe I should tell all of my

3107
05:30:50,200 --> 05:30:52,200
junior fellows the same thing.

3108
05:30:52,200 --> 05:30:54,200
What's up with these fake doors?

3109
05:31:08,200 --> 05:31:10,200
The dining room?

3110
05:31:12,200 --> 05:31:14,200
What's behind curtain number one?

3111
05:31:14,200 --> 05:31:16,200
Nothing.

3112
05:31:16,200 --> 05:31:18,200
Nothing.

3113
05:31:22,200 --> 05:31:24,200
Oh,

3114
05:31:24,200 --> 05:31:26,200
I can see behind.

3115
05:31:28,200 --> 05:31:30,200
Oh, looks like I

3116
05:31:32,200 --> 05:31:34,200
hid stuff.

3117
05:31:40,200 --> 05:31:42,200
I hate these freaking fake doors.

3118
05:31:44,200 --> 05:31:46,200
I've never played Silent Hill before.

3119
05:31:52,200 --> 05:31:54,200
That room does seem important.

3120
05:31:56,200 --> 05:31:58,200
I've always been my job to look

3121
05:31:58,200 --> 05:32:00,200
out for after the princess.

3122
05:32:00,200 --> 05:32:02,200
That's why I'm so concerned.

3123
05:32:02,200 --> 05:32:04,200
Please be safe.

3124
05:32:04,200 --> 05:32:06,200
I'm having a hard time dealing with this.

3125
05:32:06,200 --> 05:32:08,200
I must put my fingers aside and wish the best for you.

3126
05:32:12,200 --> 05:32:14,200
Okay.

3127
05:32:14,200 --> 05:32:16,200
Demon Star

3128
05:32:16,200 --> 05:32:18,200
Yiddies.

3129
05:32:18,200 --> 05:32:20,200
Yiddies?

3130
05:32:20,200 --> 05:32:22,200
Are a best way to pronounce that?

3131
05:32:22,200 --> 05:32:24,200
After many years of

3132
05:32:24,200 --> 05:32:26,200
studies, humans and illo

3133
05:32:26,200 --> 05:32:28,200
have finally located the demon's

3134
05:32:28,200 --> 05:32:30,200
home base.

3135
05:32:30,200 --> 05:32:32,200
Their world is far away in a different

3136
05:32:32,200 --> 05:32:34,200
dimension.

3137
05:32:36,200 --> 05:32:38,200
Yiddies nuts, shut up.

3138
05:32:38,200 --> 05:32:40,200
You don't get to say it.

3139
05:32:40,200 --> 05:32:42,200
Yiddies nuts, shut up.

3140
05:32:44,200 --> 05:32:46,200
Yiddies nuts, shut up.

3141
05:32:48,200 --> 05:32:50,200
Only I can say it.

3142
05:33:00,200 --> 05:33:02,200
I think it's

3143
05:33:02,200 --> 05:33:04,200
Yiddies though.

3144
05:33:04,200 --> 05:33:05,200
Hades though.

3145
05:33:05,200 --> 05:33:15,360
On a star named Hades, or the full name Saturn Hades, it might be Hades, but Hades sounds

3146
05:33:15,360 --> 05:33:18,360
cool too.

3147
05:33:18,360 --> 05:33:38,960
Hi Hades, is it Hades?

3148
05:33:38,960 --> 05:33:53,240
Hi Hades breeds, monster, and is in a constant state of war.

3149
05:33:53,240 --> 05:33:59,760
The continuous battle caused the inevitable destruction of Hi Hades.

3150
05:33:59,760 --> 05:34:04,080
After being banished from Hi Hades, the monsters wander through dimensions until they eventually

3151
05:34:04,080 --> 05:34:11,400
found Fogaya, a demon fought for a new home, or the people of Fogaya fought to preserve

3152
05:34:11,400 --> 05:34:15,080
their homeland in the Great Demon War.

3153
05:34:15,080 --> 05:34:25,200
Kind of makes you sympathize them, huh?

3154
05:34:25,200 --> 05:34:26,200
The book of Kima.

3155
05:34:27,200 --> 05:34:36,200
You might not shut up, you don't get to say it.

3156
05:34:36,200 --> 05:34:44,840
It makes them feel pretty sad if they just want to find a home.

3157
05:34:44,840 --> 05:34:51,600
This book contains this secret, which one woman once was granted from up above.

3158
05:34:51,600 --> 05:34:57,760
The creation of a superhuman involves the experiments of an ancient alchemist which

3159
05:34:57,760 --> 05:35:00,200
shall never be replicated.

3160
05:35:00,200 --> 05:35:07,080
That's it.

3161
05:35:07,080 --> 05:35:13,400
Apparently in the first game, not the remake, which I'm playing right now, but the first

3162
05:35:13,400 --> 05:35:14,400
game.

3163
05:35:14,400 --> 05:35:31,280
They had really bad translations, so apparently some of the names are really funky.

3164
05:35:31,280 --> 05:35:41,640
I've never played a game this game, what's it about?

3165
05:35:41,640 --> 05:35:56,480
I think most people would call this a Western RPG, like, you know, Shurentoon.

3166
05:36:11,640 --> 05:36:21,280
A Western JRP, yes.

3167
05:36:21,280 --> 05:36:26,240
Truton and Shuton, I forgot.

3168
05:36:26,240 --> 05:36:35,440
They made it like, what the, what the, copy, copy past the, hold on, let me google it.

3169
05:36:35,440 --> 05:36:55,760
What do you want to know now?

3170
05:36:55,760 --> 05:37:01,760
It's like based off of like, Boyle.

3171
05:37:01,760 --> 05:37:22,400
Oh, here, I don't remember what it was, Rootin, Tootin, Cowboy, Shutin.

3172
05:37:22,400 --> 05:37:46,720
It's like Boyle, Boyle, Coyle and Trouble, I have Newt and, I can't remember the rest

3173
05:37:46,720 --> 05:37:57,480
of it, oh well, whatever, which is, yeah, but it was like a parody, but like Cowboys,

3174
05:37:57,480 --> 05:38:14,040
you know, it's like Rootin, Tootin, Cowboy, Shutin, yeah, Rootin, Tootin, Toilin, Shutin,

3175
05:38:14,040 --> 05:38:20,880
no peeking in advance, okay, yeah, it's from the play, but like, they paradised it using

3176
05:38:20,880 --> 05:38:35,480
Cowboys instead, I can't find the copy pasta anymore, it was fun though, and I thought

3177
05:38:35,480 --> 05:38:44,000
it was very charming, I thought it was very charming.

3178
05:38:44,000 --> 05:39:08,920
And now I don't know what to do, like, do I go back into here and be like, sup, bia?

3179
05:39:08,920 --> 05:39:15,320
Do I go to sleep and make it the next day?

3180
05:39:15,320 --> 05:39:32,480
You'll find it searching Cowboys as witches, oh, hold on, I'll read it now, oh, I see it,

3181
05:39:32,480 --> 05:39:40,240
Rootin, Tootin, Toilin, Toilin, Shutin, Fireburn and Cowboy, Bootin, I have Newton, Spicy Beans,

3182
05:39:40,240 --> 05:39:47,360
Toalfrog and Denim Jeans, Whiskey Grit and Demon Spittle tossed in my iron griddle, with

3183
05:39:47,360 --> 05:40:16,280
the tannin of our hide, something wicked this way rides, I thought it was great,

3184
05:40:16,280 --> 05:40:35,040
we need mercy as a cowboy witch fan art now, this town, wait, this broom ain't big enough

3185
05:40:35,040 --> 05:40:43,240
for the two of us, okay, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do the attack bonus,

3186
05:40:43,240 --> 05:40:55,760
I'm gonna upgrade, upgrade, upgrade all of it,

3187
05:41:13,240 --> 05:41:39,000
sure, should I, I guess we'll spend the night, maybe I'll, oh, nice little tune, okay, while

3188
05:41:39,000 --> 05:41:55,320
that fucking did a shit all, you play this on the OG console, oh fuck you, this is the

3189
05:41:55,320 --> 05:42:14,760
OG console, I'm playing on original hardware, this is, I'm playing with the disc, we are

3190
05:42:14,760 --> 05:42:43,520
on the PS2 right now, oh, Azorah, who's cute me, oh shucks,

3191
05:42:44,520 --> 05:42:49,680
what are you doing out Azorah, hold on, what are you doing out Azorah, didn't you be getting

3192
05:42:49,680 --> 05:43:03,400
some rest right about now, I am a little confused about where I'm supposed to go,

3193
05:43:03,400 --> 05:43:18,120
I want to move on to the next part, but I'm also kind of confused,

3194
05:43:33,400 --> 05:43:44,920
why'd you let me go so far, straight ahead is King's family room, please refrain from

3195
05:43:44,920 --> 05:43:58,920
entering there, why'd you let me go so far then, rest, I feel like you should rest,

3196
05:43:59,920 --> 05:44:21,120
damn pie, what am I supposed to do, almost locked up, right, but how is that,

3197
05:44:21,120 --> 05:44:44,440
oh yeah, we gotta track those two fellas, didn't they say they were gonna go see the

3198
05:44:44,760 --> 05:44:59,480
King or, no wait they were going to see, were they gonna see, a woman's name, I remember

3199
05:44:59,560 --> 05:45:06,800
it was a woman's name, yeah I thought they left the guy at the nun's place,

3200
05:45:06,800 --> 05:45:30,440
whoa, I wanted to go get to the next part at least,

3201
05:45:36,960 --> 05:45:37,640
where'd they go,

3202
05:45:51,480 --> 05:45:53,880
you have to go to the city part, this part,

3203
05:46:06,800 --> 05:46:29,960
you want a hint, yeah I want a hint, middle building, this one, I didn't finish exploring the

3204
05:46:29,960 --> 05:46:51,400
arm shop, thank, oh hi, I thought that was odd to it, this one,

3205
05:46:59,960 --> 05:47:25,600
oh shit that would be so hard to see that is hard to see that fucking cat

3206
05:47:29,960 --> 05:47:43,960
Cutscene! Just heard some promotions, everything alright? Check, check.

3207
05:47:43,960 --> 05:47:49,960
Kind of exciting isn't it? Y'all have to urge the staff and look at accidents on the street.

3208
05:47:49,960 --> 05:47:59,960
Boss Emergency! There's been an incident up north at Lollithia's coffin!

3209
05:47:59,960 --> 05:48:05,960
Oh no, not the excavation site. Quickly tell me what happened.

3210
05:48:05,960 --> 05:48:09,960
Damage done by the earthquake was much greater than anticipated.

3211
05:48:09,960 --> 05:48:14,960
Part of the wall collapsed in the quake and monsters have come out onto the site.

3212
05:48:14,960 --> 05:48:23,960
Some of the workers were attacked by the monsters but no one's been killed yet.

3213
05:48:23,960 --> 05:48:27,960
Organize a group, drive out those monsters.

3214
05:48:27,960 --> 05:48:36,960
No can do boss, none of the workers have any experience fighting monsters.

3215
05:48:36,960 --> 05:48:42,960
Besides, they have us outnumbered. They're too much for us.

3216
05:48:42,960 --> 05:48:45,960
I see. You leave the monsters to me then.

3217
05:48:45,960 --> 05:48:51,960
In the meantime, get back to work! Pour our efforts into restoring the ruins!

3218
05:48:51,960 --> 05:48:58,960
The exhibition is coming up. I'm determined to bring Lollithia back after a thousand years of sleep.

3219
05:48:58,960 --> 05:49:04,960
Yes ma'am!

3220
05:49:04,960 --> 05:49:18,960
I don't know, I kind of like pink and green. It's kind of a very, I think, lilymon?

3221
05:49:18,960 --> 05:49:23,960
Okay, now that you've heard, there's trouble at my site.

3222
05:49:23,960 --> 05:49:33,960
And here you are a young wanderer, no doubt you false monsters. You're share of monsters.

3223
05:49:33,960 --> 05:49:39,960
Would you agree to do a little house cleaning with those monsters in the ruins?

3224
05:49:39,960 --> 05:49:45,960
I believe it will be a great opportunity for you to study at Lollithia's coffin too.

3225
05:49:45,960 --> 05:49:59,960
Do we ever show any interest in, like, as Rudy? Have we shown any interest in Lollithia's coffin?

3226
05:49:59,960 --> 05:50:06,960
I can give you 5,000 yellow, payable upon your success. That's not a bad offer, is it?

3227
05:50:06,960 --> 05:50:14,960
Okay, maybe 5,000 sounds pretty good, actually.

3228
05:50:14,960 --> 05:50:18,960
This seems like dialogue for Gack.

3229
05:50:18,960 --> 05:50:28,960
Yeah, Rudy really likes Lollithia. I don't think we ever, we ever showed any interest, huh?

3230
05:50:28,960 --> 05:50:38,960
Oh, for money, maybe. You make it, like, 10,000 yellow, that'd be nice.

3231
05:50:38,960 --> 05:50:51,960
Should we agree? Or, it's too dangerous to accept?

3232
05:50:51,960 --> 05:50:57,960
Add juice too for the lulls.

3233
05:50:57,960 --> 05:51:04,960
Please understand, it won't be easy. The artifact must be excavated from those ruins for the upcoming exhibition.

3234
05:51:04,960 --> 05:51:08,960
At least 5,000 yellow is a very good reward, considering the risk involved.

3235
05:51:08,960 --> 05:51:16,960
We have the illusion of choice once again.

3236
05:51:16,960 --> 05:51:20,960
Good, I knew you would take it.

3237
05:51:20,960 --> 05:51:27,960
It senses inadvertent involvement in the earthquake, which caused the accident.

3238
05:51:27,960 --> 05:51:33,960
You look as if you blame yourself for what transpired. Maybe investigating this will help you too.

3239
05:51:33,960 --> 05:51:37,960
In any case, we need to focus on our tasks.

3240
05:51:37,960 --> 05:51:41,960
I am Emma Hetfield.

3241
05:51:41,960 --> 05:51:49,960
I'm in charge of excavating the artifact. I'm actually an engineer. I like to work on machines.

3242
05:51:49,960 --> 05:52:04,960
I'm off to the excavation site up north, where Lollithia is located. This is a dangerous place, so please be well prepared. I cannot stress this enough.

3243
05:52:04,960 --> 05:52:14,960
I will meet you there. If I were you, I would gather up a group before you head up.

3244
05:52:14,960 --> 05:52:22,960
We have no choice. She's quite tall. Don't you like tall women?

3245
05:52:22,960 --> 05:52:31,960
I think Azura and Chibi are taller than me.

3246
05:52:31,960 --> 05:52:34,960
We're partying now.

3247
05:52:34,960 --> 05:52:47,960
So that means we found someone, so that's it.

3248
05:52:47,960 --> 05:52:53,960
There you go.

3249
05:52:53,960 --> 05:53:01,960
Are you heading for Lollithia's coffin? I too am drawn by the word Lollithia.

3250
05:53:01,960 --> 05:53:09,960
Drawing to the word Lollithia, huh?

3251
05:53:09,960 --> 05:53:17,960
Hehehehehehe.

3252
05:53:17,960 --> 05:53:22,960
You'll change connection with it.

3253
05:53:22,960 --> 05:53:26,080
Can I accompany you to Lalitha's coffin?

3254
05:53:26,080 --> 05:53:27,880
I am Cecilia.

3255
05:53:27,880 --> 05:53:30,000
I'm familiar with the Crest Sorcery,

3256
05:53:30,000 --> 05:53:32,280
the Crest Graph, and it's possible to cast

3257
05:53:32,280 --> 05:53:34,040
various magic spells as needed.

3258
05:53:35,080 --> 05:53:37,720
I have the Crest Graph with me.

3259
05:53:37,720 --> 05:53:40,480
Across from the Lodge is the Magic Guild,

3260
05:53:40,480 --> 05:53:43,640
where we can edit the list of magic spells.

3261
05:53:43,640 --> 05:53:45,080
The more spells we have on our hand,

3262
05:53:45,080 --> 05:53:47,480
the more ways we can handle different situations

3263
05:53:47,480 --> 05:53:48,640
which will occur.

3264
05:53:50,200 --> 05:53:51,840
Cecilia, join the party.

3265
05:53:53,800 --> 05:53:57,680
Have anyone read the book?

3266
05:53:59,160 --> 05:54:00,760
I thought it was a very good book.

3267
05:54:09,280 --> 05:54:10,760
Well, you're still streaming.

3268
05:54:12,600 --> 05:54:13,600
What can I say?

3269
05:54:13,600 --> 05:54:16,560
Wild arms, a sail like Cyan.

3270
05:54:20,320 --> 05:54:21,680
How may I help you?

3271
05:54:21,680 --> 05:54:23,680
Can I edit hack spells?

3272
05:54:23,680 --> 05:54:25,200
What the heck is this?

3273
05:54:26,480 --> 05:54:28,600
Best to see the effects of this magic.

3274
05:54:33,720 --> 05:54:36,840
Make the Crush Magic spell cost you 60 Gellas.

3275
05:54:36,840 --> 05:54:37,840
Sure.

3276
05:54:51,680 --> 05:55:02,680
I've only watched the movie, the Stanley Kubrick movie.

3277
05:55:04,680 --> 05:55:06,680
You can rename spells, can you?

3278
05:55:15,440 --> 05:55:17,040
Looks like you can, Tempai.

3279
05:55:21,680 --> 05:55:28,680
Let's return spell.

3280
05:55:29,680 --> 05:55:33,680
No, I don't want support magic.

3281
05:55:51,680 --> 05:56:00,680
Who do we have?

3282
05:56:00,680 --> 05:56:08,680
We have Cecilia, Rudy, have we encountered Jack yet?

3283
05:56:08,680 --> 05:56:09,680
Probably not, right?

3284
05:56:10,680 --> 05:56:19,680
I feel like...

3285
05:56:23,680 --> 05:56:25,680
Jack was back in the cast of Shit.

3286
05:56:25,680 --> 05:56:26,680
We did.

3287
05:56:28,680 --> 05:56:30,680
May I did talk to him?

3288
05:56:30,680 --> 05:56:32,680
Fuck, was he?

3289
05:56:33,680 --> 05:56:35,680
I forgore!

3290
05:56:40,680 --> 05:56:42,680
The treasure door.

3291
05:56:43,680 --> 05:56:44,680
You're so right.

3292
05:56:45,680 --> 05:56:46,680
You're so right.

3293
05:56:46,680 --> 05:56:48,680
You're so right, Bestie.

3294
05:56:52,680 --> 05:56:54,680
Totally forgot.

3295
05:57:00,680 --> 05:57:02,680
Anyway, here's Johnny!

3296
05:57:09,680 --> 05:57:18,680
Wait, which way was I supposed to go?

3297
05:57:18,680 --> 05:57:19,680
Oh, there.

3298
05:57:28,680 --> 05:57:31,680
Her Bestie status were more than Bestie's.

3299
05:57:31,680 --> 05:57:33,680
Oh, right there!

3300
05:57:35,680 --> 05:57:36,680
Oops.

3301
05:57:40,680 --> 05:57:45,680
I wasn't going anywhere with the locked door in front of me.

3302
05:57:45,680 --> 05:57:51,680
Wait, you don't work for the castle, you scare me like that.

3303
05:57:51,680 --> 05:57:53,680
Okay, you're another wanderer.

3304
05:57:53,680 --> 05:57:58,680
I know where I can make some money or maybe find some treasure.

3305
05:57:58,680 --> 05:57:59,680
What?

3306
05:57:59,680 --> 05:58:01,680
You're after Lolithia.

3307
05:58:01,680 --> 05:58:03,680
You said Lolithia, right?

3308
05:58:04,680 --> 05:58:05,680
Hoping to have.

3309
05:58:05,680 --> 05:58:09,680
We also happened to have some business with Lolithia.

3310
05:58:09,680 --> 05:58:11,680
We happened to be on our way there.

3311
05:58:11,680 --> 05:58:14,680
I'm Jack, my companion is Hanpan.

3312
05:58:14,680 --> 05:58:16,680
Like it or not, we're coming with you.

3313
05:58:17,680 --> 05:58:19,680
Jack joined the party.

3314
05:58:21,680 --> 05:58:23,680
He totally was gonna rule the king.

3315
05:58:26,680 --> 05:58:32,680
We only have Jack, Rudy, and Cecilia, right?

3316
05:58:33,680 --> 05:58:41,680
Wait, can Cecilia go into that magic room?

3317
05:59:03,680 --> 05:59:06,680
Probably not.

3318
05:59:24,680 --> 05:59:26,680
Let's feel safe.

3319
05:59:26,680 --> 05:59:30,680
And then the adventure in Athos.

3320
05:59:30,680 --> 05:59:37,680
And then the adventure at the excavation site will be left for another stream.

3321
05:59:37,680 --> 05:59:39,680
Why do you think so, Pie?

3322
06:00:00,680 --> 06:00:10,680
We uh, eat, eat, wait.

3323
06:00:10,680 --> 06:00:12,680
We saves.

3324
06:00:13,680 --> 06:00:18,680
And then eat.

3325
06:00:19,680 --> 06:00:23,680
I think I just have to...

3326
06:00:24,680 --> 06:00:26,680
Uh, what's the word?

3327
06:00:31,680 --> 06:00:35,680
I think I just have to turn off the PS2, right?

3328
06:00:39,680 --> 06:00:41,680
I can just turn it off?

3329
06:00:50,680 --> 06:00:51,680
Okay.

3330
06:00:52,680 --> 06:00:55,680
Yeah, okay, let's turn it off then.

3331
06:00:56,680 --> 06:00:59,680
There we go.

3332
06:01:00,680 --> 06:01:02,680
Aw, quiet now.

3333
06:01:05,680 --> 06:01:07,680
There's no quick game mechanics.

3334
06:01:08,680 --> 06:01:11,680
We're talking old school.

3335
06:01:17,680 --> 06:01:20,680
We're talking old school, Senpai.

3336
06:01:20,680 --> 06:01:25,680
I've never had a PS2 before. I've used it a few times, but I just can't remember.

3337
06:01:30,680 --> 06:01:32,680
I didn't grow up with it, Senpai.

3338
06:01:33,680 --> 06:01:36,680
Also, my chat's not working, it looks like.

3339
06:01:38,680 --> 06:01:43,680
No more cowboy hat. The cowboy hat's sitting on my head sideways.

3340
06:01:47,680 --> 06:01:49,680
I forgot.

3341
06:01:51,680 --> 06:01:59,680
Never bought a console. My first console was a...

3342
06:02:06,680 --> 06:02:07,680
PS4.

3343
06:02:07,680 --> 06:02:13,680
And the PS4, to turn off the PS4, you go to the home menu and then you go to, like...

3344
06:02:14,680 --> 06:02:20,680
You scroll all the way to power and then it's, like, sleep or shut down, I think. Something like that.

3345
06:02:21,680 --> 06:02:24,680
I can't quite remember, but...

3346
06:02:25,680 --> 06:02:31,680
That was my first... system?

3347
06:02:33,680 --> 06:02:40,680
My first, like, game console was the DS.

3348
06:02:40,680 --> 06:02:45,680
The DS Lite. And the DS Lite, you know, you had to save.

3349
06:02:45,680 --> 06:02:51,680
I guess you could, you could technically, yeah, it was fine if you just held the button, right?

3350
06:02:51,680 --> 06:02:54,680
You held the button and could just turn off.

3351
06:02:54,680 --> 06:02:58,680
But, like, I wasn't too sure, because they all work differently, right?

3352
06:02:59,680 --> 06:03:06,680
So, I was like, oh, wait. I can't remember.

3353
06:03:06,680 --> 06:03:11,680
I was playing with this earlier, but now my brain is mush.

3354
06:03:11,680 --> 06:03:13,680
My brain is mush.

3355
06:03:13,680 --> 06:03:35,680
It's always different from one console to another. Yeah, like, for example, the Switch, like, to turn it off, you got to go all the way to the side and go, like, oh, put it to sleep, right?

3356
06:03:43,680 --> 06:03:46,680
I loved, uh...

3357
06:03:49,680 --> 06:03:53,680
I loved the, uh... what do you call it?

3358
06:03:53,680 --> 06:04:01,680
I love the DS, but I want to experience your childhood to Senpai.

3359
06:04:01,680 --> 06:04:11,680
So, I'm going to be trying to play retro games and catching up on games that I, um, I never got to play as a kid.

3360
06:04:12,680 --> 06:04:15,680
I never got to play as a kid.

3361
06:04:15,680 --> 06:04:26,680
I only got the DS because, uh, Mama and Papa Mercy were like, they saw the cover show, but they were a big brain academy, and they were like, okay, we can get you one, and that was it.

3362
06:04:28,680 --> 06:04:33,680
Literally the only reason why I was able to get any game system.

3363
06:04:41,680 --> 06:05:01,680
I... yeah, that's the only reason why I got it, and then my first game game was Pokemon Pearl.

3364
06:05:01,680 --> 06:05:03,680
Yeah, it was Pokemon Pearl.

3365
06:05:03,680 --> 06:05:06,680
I was still quite, quite older.

3366
06:05:06,680 --> 06:05:18,680
I was quite, uh, older than, than, like, you know, at the age that people are like, oh, when did you get into Pokemon?

3367
06:05:18,680 --> 06:05:24,680
I wasn't the age... I wasn't at the age that I was a bit older.

3368
06:05:24,680 --> 06:05:27,680
I was a bit older for the demographic, I guess.

3369
06:05:27,680 --> 06:05:29,680
I made me 14?

3370
06:05:34,680 --> 06:05:36,680
Wait.

3371
06:05:37,680 --> 06:05:39,680
Wait.

3372
06:05:40,680 --> 06:05:42,680
Wait.

3373
06:06:02,680 --> 06:06:04,680
Forgetty Beam!

3374
06:06:04,680 --> 06:06:06,680
Boom!

3375
06:06:34,680 --> 06:06:36,680
Huh?

3376
06:06:40,680 --> 06:06:43,680
We were not talking about anything.

3377
06:06:52,680 --> 06:06:56,680
I heard something about battle network, battle network, like Mega Man?

3378
06:06:56,680 --> 06:06:58,680
Like Mega Man?

3379
06:07:03,680 --> 06:07:05,680
Mega Man Battle Network.

3380
06:07:05,680 --> 06:07:20,680
Oh, I was watching, uh, Mew from Speciality play, uh, Mega Man X, the Mega Man X series.

3381
06:07:21,680 --> 06:07:25,680
Um...

3382
06:07:36,680 --> 06:07:39,680
It was really good at it, actually.

3383
06:07:39,680 --> 06:07:43,680
Battle Network is completely different, is it?

3384
06:07:43,680 --> 06:07:45,680
Is it?

3385
06:07:48,680 --> 06:07:52,680
I've only seen speed runners play, like, Mega Man games.

3386
06:07:52,680 --> 06:07:57,680
I haven't actually seen Mega Man play normally.

3387
06:08:00,680 --> 06:08:06,680
I actually have, uh, a few friends who are Mega Man speed runners.

3388
06:08:07,680 --> 06:08:24,680
So, I'm just, like, I've never seen it play normally, but I've only seen the ones where they have, like, glitches and stuff, and people, like, paged through walls or, like, beaten enemy really fast.

3389
06:08:24,680 --> 06:08:26,680
I've only seen that version.

3390
06:08:26,680 --> 06:08:32,680
I feel like I will be, like, a very distorted view if I play...

3391
06:08:32,680 --> 06:08:40,680
If I try to play any Mega Man game, because then I'll just be trying to, like, emulate the speed runners.

3392
06:08:47,680 --> 06:08:49,680
That's what I feel like I would end up doing.

3393
06:08:49,680 --> 06:08:53,680
Oh my gosh, actually my brain is so mushy right now.

3394
06:08:53,680 --> 06:08:57,680
I think a six hour stream is pretty freaking good.

3395
06:08:57,680 --> 06:09:00,680
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

3396
06:09:02,680 --> 06:09:04,680
Give me a second.

3397
06:09:04,680 --> 06:09:06,680
I am soul?

3398
06:09:10,680 --> 06:09:11,680
Dummy.

3399
06:09:11,680 --> 06:09:13,680
Right now.

3400
06:09:17,680 --> 06:09:21,680
Give me a second. I think I'm very dummy right now.

3401
06:09:23,680 --> 06:09:25,680
What is my schedule?

3402
06:09:26,680 --> 06:09:28,680
Tomorrow!

3403
06:09:28,680 --> 06:09:31,680
Or, rather, today!

3404
06:09:33,680 --> 06:09:36,680
I will be doing a member's watch along.

3405
06:09:36,680 --> 06:09:49,680
Uh, we're all going to be watching Eagle Eye, which is not a great film, but one that's close to my heart.

3406
06:09:49,680 --> 06:10:05,680
One that made me really, really appreciate film and really got me into, like, entertainment in general.

3407
06:10:05,680 --> 06:10:08,680
This would be the domino effect.

3408
06:10:08,680 --> 06:10:11,680
Eagle Eye is what made me into a VTuber.

3409
06:10:14,680 --> 06:10:16,680
The reason why I'm here.

3410
06:10:20,680 --> 06:10:25,680
So, we'll do a member's watch along for Eagle Eye.

3411
06:10:27,680 --> 06:10:36,680
And then, on Saturday, I have the VLR rating VTubers design.

3412
06:10:36,680 --> 06:10:41,680
That will be, I believe, on Icy's channel.

3413
06:10:41,680 --> 06:10:48,680
And, then, I know I wrote something, there was nothing for Sunday, but I totally forgot to plan it.

3414
06:10:48,680 --> 06:10:52,680
But there is a watch party.

3415
06:10:52,680 --> 06:10:54,680
A watch along party.

3416
06:10:54,680 --> 06:10:56,680
Um,

3417
06:10:56,680 --> 06:11:03,680
For Umeb Plus's Dream Come True concert that I'm really looking forward to.

3418
06:11:03,680 --> 06:11:10,680
So, uh, that's around, what time is the Umeb Plus concert?

3419
06:11:10,680 --> 06:11:18,680
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

3420
06:11:19,680 --> 06:11:27,680
So, uh, that's around, what time is the Umeb Plus concert?

3421
06:11:27,680 --> 06:11:29,680
5pm PDT.

3422
06:11:29,680 --> 06:11:31,680
Is that 5pm PDT?

3423
06:11:31,680 --> 06:11:35,680
So, uh, convert that as you wish.

3424
06:11:38,680 --> 06:11:43,680
So, you can watch the Umeb Plus concert with me if you wanted.

3425
06:11:43,680 --> 06:11:52,680
Or with any of my other gen mates, I think only a couple of them aren't participating, I can't remember quite so well.

3426
06:11:52,680 --> 06:11:56,680
Brain too mushy right now to actually recall anything.

3427
06:12:14,680 --> 06:12:18,680
Thoughts, head empty.

3428
06:12:18,680 --> 06:12:22,680
I'm looking forward to it, I'm looking forward to it.

3429
06:12:22,680 --> 06:12:32,680
So, I hope to see you all there, I hope you can also watch the concert live as well, maybe put it on another screen.

3430
06:12:32,680 --> 06:12:42,680
Yeah, put it on another screen, maybe try a...

3431
06:12:42,680 --> 06:12:57,680
Are you doing a watch along for that here?

3432
06:12:57,680 --> 06:13:05,680
Uh, I believe so, yes, I'll do, I believe I am doing a watch along on my channel.

3433
06:13:05,680 --> 06:13:10,680
So, feel free to take a peak season pie.

3434
06:13:10,680 --> 06:13:18,680
So, I'll be streaming my PLV and reacting to the Umeb Plus girls.

3435
06:13:18,680 --> 06:13:28,680
I've talked to them behind the scenes and they've worked really hard to bring you a wonderful concert.

3436
06:13:28,680 --> 06:13:33,680
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

3437
06:13:33,680 --> 06:13:40,680
And then, I guess on the same Sunday I'll post up my new schedule.

3438
06:13:40,680 --> 06:13:53,680
The following week, as a preview for the following week, it's going to be a bit of a shorter week for me at least.

3439
06:13:53,680 --> 06:14:05,680
So, I'm looking forward to taking a tiny, tiny, tiny break because I've been kind of like working a lot lately.

3440
06:14:05,680 --> 06:14:17,680
I've been working a lot lately, so sometimes my days off are not really days off and I'm doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes.

3441
06:14:17,680 --> 06:14:33,680
Like, for example, like my day off, I was working on setting this all up for Senpai and running to get the PS2.

3442
06:14:33,680 --> 06:14:36,680
It was like an odd day thing.

3443
06:14:36,680 --> 06:14:40,680
God, I'm so tired.

3444
06:14:40,680 --> 06:14:45,680
So, hopefully, we get to play more games.

3445
06:14:45,680 --> 06:14:49,680
I'm looking forward to returning back to Wild Arms.

3446
06:14:49,680 --> 06:14:50,680
I hope Senpai's are too.

3447
06:14:50,680 --> 06:14:56,680
What do you think of Wild Arms?

3448
06:14:56,680 --> 06:14:57,680
Was it fun?

3449
06:14:57,680 --> 06:14:59,680
Like the Ultra Cold F?

3450
06:14:59,680 --> 06:15:00,680
Was it good?

3451
06:15:00,680 --> 06:15:01,680
Did you like it?

3452
06:15:01,680 --> 06:15:05,680
I hope you liked it.

3453
06:15:05,680 --> 06:15:12,680
Because I do want to return to it.

3454
06:15:12,680 --> 06:15:15,680
But I'm not sure if, like, Senpai's liked it.

3455
06:15:15,680 --> 06:15:23,680
So, I was like, oh well, if it wasn't that fun, maybe.

3456
06:15:23,680 --> 06:15:34,680
Maybe, maybe we can, you know, yeah.

3457
06:15:34,680 --> 06:15:46,680
I think, I think if there's like a lot of grinding work, I'll do that off-stream to make it easier for Senpai.

3458
06:15:46,680 --> 06:15:49,680
Hopefully, it's not too long of a game.

3459
06:15:49,680 --> 06:15:50,680
I'm hoping.

3460
06:15:50,680 --> 06:16:00,680
RPGs tend to be very long games and that's one thing I don't like about RPGs is that they're very, very, very long.

3461
06:16:00,680 --> 06:16:11,680
Yeah.

3462
06:16:11,680 --> 06:16:12,680
Okay.

3463
06:16:12,680 --> 06:16:15,680
I don't think anyone's on, obviously.

3464
06:16:15,680 --> 06:16:21,680
It's probably super late right now.

3465
06:16:21,680 --> 06:16:22,680
Yeah.

3466
06:16:22,680 --> 06:16:28,680
So, I'll leave you awe to the Abyss of Silence.

3467
06:16:28,680 --> 06:16:30,680
Wait, the Silence of the Abyss?

3468
06:16:30,680 --> 06:16:34,680
I think that's a better way to say it.

3469
06:16:34,680 --> 06:16:38,680
I'll see you all again next time.

3470
06:16:38,680 --> 06:16:40,680
Okay?

3471
06:16:40,680 --> 06:16:43,680
Wow!

3472
06:16:43,680 --> 06:16:45,680
Scream for Mercy!

3473
06:16:45,680 --> 06:16:48,680
Weeeeee!

3474
06:17:10,680 --> 06:17:29,680
Thank you for watching!
