1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Wake up Senpai Senpai wake up. Oh, you're still a bit dizzy. That's okay. I hit you on the head

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,960
pretty hard. Up in Adam though, I heard you wanted to get to know me better. So I brought my special

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,640
love diary with all the information about me that you need to know so we can be together forever.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,600
And I'll have all the time in the world to get to know you too! So let's get started!

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,360
My name is Mercy Modiste. Mercy being the last thing people say before they're killed.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,920
And Modiste meaning dressmaker in French. My birthday is March 15th. In Japanese that's

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,720
Saikou. Saikou means the best. Oh, sorry. Don't worry about that. That's not my blood.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:51,200
Oh, where was I? I am an ex-student and my height is 160 centimeters tall. Meaning I'm about

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:01,360
five three in freedom units. Here are my likes Senpai. I love you Senpai! I love you so much.

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,440
I also really love ear snacks, children's cartoon, color coordination. So if we everywhere

11
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,880
matching outfits together. Artbooks, they make me so happy. And I love phrase, especially from you

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,840
Senpai! I love phrase. As my dislikes, I dislike eggs. All kinds of eggs. I'm allergic. I dislike

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,880
porridge. It reminds me of when I'm sick. Beer. I don't like beer, but I do like beer snacks. So

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,400
I like the saltiness of beer snacks but not beer. I dislike coffee. The bad fridge. Coffee flavor

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
things are okay though. My uvula is kind of enlargent. So it makes my throat kind of irritated.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,760
So I don't like carbonation. I don't like math and numbers. Memorizing your phone number Senpai

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,600
is so hard. And where you live, it's really hard to memorize all that. It's okay if you don't know

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,360
these. But if you do know these, you are based and super lit. I'm kind of pretentious and I kind

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,040
of have like pretentious likes. So some notable ones here for animes I like are Cardcaptor Sakura,

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,360
Hunter Hunter, Dungeon Meshie, Death Note, Cowboy Beepop. I think you understand my tastes.

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,880
As for games I like as well, I love story-based games. As you can see though, I really need to

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,480
expand my gaming repertoire. So please help me Senpai. As for movies I like, I believe these are

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,840
the best of the best. The greasy strangler, eagle eye, gold swatch. It's such a beautiful day.

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,120
Sherlock Jr. Imitation of Life. Bro, peeping Tom. I can't wait to share them with you Senpai. I hope

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,600
we can do like Watch Alongs of my favorites. As for music, I kind of don't listen to music Senpai.

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,760
So all I really listen to are like classical music, game, OSTs, songs my friends made and recommend

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,800
to me. But yeah, I like working in silence. Here are the credits. All the credits will also be on

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,880
the Violaur website. So I'd like to give special thanks to Design, Squishy Ghoul, and The Rig,

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,200
Dean Nari. Thank you so much everyone on this page for allowing me to meet Senpai.

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,160
Alright, skill times. I am super perceptive. So if something's wrong, I will know right away. I'm

31
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,200
like a little secret detective. I can speak basic Vietnamese.

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,160
Stop.

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,200
Come on, Neil. And I know only like really baby Japanese.

34
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:12,480
I have decent acting and decent singing skills as well. A variety of interesting

35
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:22,240
laughs and noises. And I'm a super ganky girl. My hobbies are snooping, photography, research,

36
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:30,160
media study, being a total weeb, fashion design, and what's this down here? Oh, who put that there?

37
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,160
My weakness is motion sickness. That is why most of my games are like that. I mean, sorry,

38
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,360
that's the third thing in the way. Overthinking. I tend to overthink a lot. If things are too simple,

39
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,280
I might overthink them and just go like, no, it can't be that simple. And of course, in patients,

40
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,840
I'm a little impatient with a lot of things. Okay, here are my goals, Senpai. So my goals are

41
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,120
to pursue voice acting and appear in an anime or video game, move to a place with better internet,

42
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,480
get a sound isolation booth, get over my motion sickness to play first person games,

43
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,200
host a concert and perform 3D lives or events or even 3D skits, to bring to life my original songs

44
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,800
that I wrote, to have a product based off of me, to bring home a play button for my mother who's

45
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,480
always wanted to see one, to reach over a million Senpais and make them smile, and to make memories

46
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:33,760
with you, my darling Senpai. And of course, the best one of all, to reach my perfect very tail

47
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,560
happily ever after. And I won't let anyone get in that way. Here are my tags, Senpai. I have no

48
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,800
idea. I'm not very creative. I'm not very punny. In 2.0, I'm going to ask my Senpais for a bit of

49
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,600
help with my tags. My Oshi mark is a pair of scissors, broken the heart, but I don't want my

50
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,280
heart broken. So you guys will fix that up, right? And the fan name for these little guys

51
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,400
are called snippets. Aren't they super, super adorable guy? Let's talk about my favorite thing,

52
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,200
my gen mates. These are drawn in the style of sechis like blue archive work. So they're super,

53
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:20,880
super funny and cute. My first impressions of my gen mates is that in me is surprisingly

54
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,240
hick, but in a cute way, baby girl. She's a super memer. I see when I first saw her,

55
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,440
I thought she would be super mesugecky. And guess what? I was right. Mumme, sometimes I'm scared

56
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,080
of her. Not gonna lie, but I feel very loved. She's very clumsy, but in a like a super cute way.

57
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Shivi is so brave, very independent, cool, independent woman. She's a hard worker. Maybe

58
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,360
she works too hard. Azura right here. I thought she was a dancer when I first saw her because

59
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,960
of her colors. She is mommy. Like that's it. She's mommy. That's it. Her voice is very good. I

60
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:07,280
have never heard a voice so dripping and like lost. I'm just a great gamer and a legatic.

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,360
I love them so much. Let me show me off to you guys now to my senpai's. Look at my feetsies

62
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:25,280
with my knee high fishnet socks as well. You can't see that part. Sorry. I have wonderful

63
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,440
garters on me. I'm sorry about the band-aids. I'm just really clumsy guys. My beautiful bouncy bow.

64
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,920
And of course my choker. Let's have a closer look, huh? Here's some of my expressions that I can do.

65
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,680
It can look like this weird little freaking hamster. I can be really angry if you guys piss me off.

66
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,720
Suddenly there seems to be no more senpai's. And I can cry. You don't want to make me sad,

67
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,080
right senpai? I also have a dark face. So if I'm very disappointed in you, I also have dead fish eyes.

68
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,040
Blush in case I love you so much senpai. Heart eyes, which I always am in love with you senpai.

69
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,000
Question mark. Oh, sorry. It's a little bit up. What did you mean by that? What happened? I don't

70
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,840
get it. My shock dies. Senpai, you love me, right? You love me, right? I can smile a little bit.

71
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:27,280
And of course my famous yandere hands. I love you so much senpai. And you may ask,

72
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,200
what's under my eye patch? It's another eye. I wear this eye patch so I can see in the dark

73
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:42,400
so I can always see you no matter what senpai. Now that that's sort of over. I want you guys

74
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:51,600
to like and subscribe. Leave a comment, of course. But as always, our times are going to be cut short.

75
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:00,720
So take a deep breath now. Really deeply now. I'll see you soon.
