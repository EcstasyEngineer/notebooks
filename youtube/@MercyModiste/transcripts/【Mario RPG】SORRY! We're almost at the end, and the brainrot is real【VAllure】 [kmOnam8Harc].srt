Where was the boost attack up?

21
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,100
This one's squirrel.

22
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Wow.

23
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm slow.

24
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,100
And then, mawio.

25
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Ah! Oh, that was a lot still.

26
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Last!

27
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Ah!

28
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Ah!

29
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Beach, get in here!

30
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:42,100
No! Not an egg!

31
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I hate eggs! Disgusting things!

32
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Okay.

33
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Oh! Okay, not bad, not bad.

34
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Okay, can't block that. Got it.

35
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Okay, okay, group hug! Group hug!

36
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Yes, yes, yes.

37
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Die!

38
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Coward!

39
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:39,100
I think I like your jaundice four eyes the best.

40
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Hey.

41
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Can do triple move, I think.

42
00:11:46,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Nah, we'll just hit this one first.

43
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Ah! How many eggs do you have?

44
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Yes, stinky eggs.

45
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Is the jinx clone going to hurt?

46
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Is it going to hurt?

47
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Is it going to hurt?

48
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Is it as strong as jinx?

49
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Ah! Fuck it.

50
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Oh, thank you. It was not.

51
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Flap! It's what you get!

52
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Only ten!

53
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Lizakupa!

54
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Huh? Where am I? Bowser, hello! How have you been?

55
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I made it back here somehow, but it seems like I've been brainwashed or something.

56
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,100
This seems like an excuse. A likely excuse.

57
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,100
I can't seem to remember everything. Have I done something wrong?

58
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Ugh, don't worry about it. Let's just put it behind us.

59
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,100
It's great running into a loyal minion like you.

60
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,100
I don't, I don't think so. I don't think so.

61
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,100
I'm glad. It looks like you've got some tough new minions now, but my magic can still help you.

62
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Watch this! Hey, what you pay for it?

63
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,100
This magic treasure box will never run out of coins. Just keep hitting it.

64
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:45,100
I'll be here if you need me. Come by when you need to rejuvenate HP and magic.

65
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:58,100
You're not lying to me, right?

66
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:05,100
Is it actually infinite?

67
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Is it really infinite? Not counterfeit?

68
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Oops, hold on. Oops, I didn't mean to do that. I want- Ah! Hold on, buttons!

69
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Party? Yes, you here. Yes, Peach stays.

70
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Maybe Gino instead of Bowser. No, Bowser. For this section.

71
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:55,100
So, use 10%, get 10% off, game yourself, using cold mercy.

72
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Wow, what a great deal.

73
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Please buy a lot. Use my cold a lot and I too can get a waifu cup.

74
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Like, actually, though? Wait, how much did I get now? Oh, well, whatever.

75
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:44,100
What's in door one?

76
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,100
What's in door two?

77
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:57,100
You still hanging around? Oh, you want more items, huh? Since I'm in a good mood, just remember, I can't always be coming to your rescue, you know?

78
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Is anything else you need? Best to buy it now.

79
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:16,100
Uh, got it. Uh, I will get everything, please.

80
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Is start cape good?

81
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,100
It's got better defense, I guess.

82
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Yeah!

83
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:49,100
I better go- Wait, bye.

84
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Bye.

85
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Bye. Let's just get everything. Bye.

86
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Anything else?

87
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:16,100
I'll buy the dress, but I won't equip it. I just think it's cool.

88
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:25,100
See ya. How? Oh, he's our friend now?

89
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,100
He's our friend now?

90
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,100
We have friend now?

91
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:48,100
We have friend?

92
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:58,100
I'm going.

93
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm so sad.

94
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:10,100
You caused me so much trouble, but your little, your little pal thing saved me.

95
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Okay, I'll clear now.

96
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I just want the money.

97
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Can I make it back to a thousand?

98
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Oh yeah, and money for fireworks.

99
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:56,100
My gosh, that's expensive fireworks.

100
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:12,100
500 each? That's so wild.

101
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:20,100
I'm almost there.

102
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Why did I have to jump for this, huh? Can I at least get two?

103
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:39,100
What the heck is auto-jump?

104
00:20:39,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Yeah, nice even number.

105
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Give me a second.

106
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Just in case.

107
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:24,100
One, I don't trust myself. Two, I also still don't trust myself.

108
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:34,100
What's turbo control?

109
00:21:34,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Ah!

110
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Ah, four!

111
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I don't even think I can get to 30. To be honest, I don't think I can get to 30. See?

112
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Oh!

113
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:40,100
My record was 15.

114
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Ah!

115
00:22:50,100 --> 00:23:05,100
I'm still gonna just hit it.

116
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:12,100
I'm not very good.

117
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Jump on it!

118
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Well, more practice.

119
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Fuck, I got worse.

120
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Actually, can I switch you out for Gino?

121
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Ooh! Can I do that again?

122
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Not bad.

123
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,100
I gotta make this right!

124
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,100
This is the biggest one I've seen.

125
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Is there anything on top?

126
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Ha ha ha ha!

127
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Ah, so you're the notorious Mario. I'm impressed you made it thus far.

128
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,100
I didn't think you could. Wait, why are the shy guys like holding on to the stuff?

129
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,100
The chandelier.

130
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Oh feisty little fellow, aren't you? But this is the end of the line.

131
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:55,100
Now you've got to deal with me, on guard!

132
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:03,100
Do what? His name's Boomer.

133
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Do I hit Boomer? Can I hit the shy guy thing?

134
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Wow, I really do suck.

135
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:30,100
I suck.

136
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,100
Oh, that's not bad.

137
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Die!

138
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Sorry, I'm trying to practice so much.

139
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Ah, Gino beam!

140
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Thanks, the other attack did more!

141
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:44,100
Why is he a different color?

142
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Oops.

143
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Argh, this is absurd! I can't be defeated by them!

144
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:21,100
I won't let this happen! I won't fall in battle!

145
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,100
I'm having an attack!

146
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,100
I don't need your sympathy! I'm a soldier, I'm prepared to go!

147
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:40,100
Take a dive, shiny chandelier, ouch!

148
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
See ya, kids.

149
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Boomer, oh poor Boomer!

150
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,100
I'm not too worried, a little fall isn't going to hurt you.

151
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Alright, Mario, I'll lead you to the top. Must hurry to the pointed place.

152
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:09,100
Hang on tight! In the way we go!

153
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Boomer's committed sudoku.

154
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:25,100
You're getting the hang of it! Increasing speed!

155
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Now we're just dancing as he did!

156
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,100
As he committed sudoku!

157
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,100
He's just dancing on his corpse.

158
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Next stop, top four. Please fasten your seat belts in.

159
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Wait a sec, there are no seat belts!

160
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,100
I didn't win that much, damn.

161
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,100
The eyes are protecting X-Saur! Okay, understood.

162
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,100
Um...

163
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Left eye or right eye?

164
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,100
I mean, plastic!

165
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Left, right, left, right.

166
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Man.

167
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Please don't kill me. I'm begging you, please don't kill me. Oh thank goodness.

168
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Wait, X-Saur is this thing on top? Not down here? Wait, the bad guy is here? Not here?

169
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Wait, who's X-Saur? I thought we were fighting Smithy!

170
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Oh no, this isn't the real boss, is it?

171
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:26,100
Aw man.

172
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:34,100
X-Saur's protection is gone. Ow!

173
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,100
I think I need Peach here soon.

174
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:56,100
I think I can triple move this. I'm gonna get it again, right?

175
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:09,100
Alright, friendship! Let's go! Please do not say one.

176
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,100
I will literally start crying again.

177
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:23,100
I need...

178
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,100
I need...

179
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Aw man.

180
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Oof, oof, oof, I need you to switch with Peach right now.

181
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,100
So pog!

182
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Oof.

183
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:21,100
Okay, okay, you can do this, Peach.

184
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:32,100
You can do this. You can do this, Peach, okay?

185
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Oh!

186
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:45,100
What the fuck was that?!

187
00:32:45,100 --> 00:33:14,100
Wait, I just... wait!

188
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Okay!

189
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:30,100
But I did max damage? I'm a fucking god.

190
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:38,100
I'm a fucking god!

191
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:51,100
Do you know where this leads to? It looks like the X-Saur's the contact between the two worlds. In other words, if we follow this road, we'll find Smithy. What's keeping us?

192
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Hang on! Wait, sorry. Hang on!

193
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Hey, I only joined so I could get my castle back! I'm not going to be dragged along on this stupid hunt!

194
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,100
I'm going to gather my minions and rebuild my castle!

195
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:13,100
And you, Mario, as an official member of Bowser's minion, is your duty to help with the repairs!

196
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Bowser, you're completely missing the point.

197
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:36,100
I ought to rip your stuffing out! He's made of wood, Bowser! You can't rip out stuffing out of wood!

198
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:46,100
No. Wait, no. Think about it, Bowser. X-Saur connects the two worlds, right? Even though we defeated X-Saur, there will be other weapons, beasts, that come through that connection.

199
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:53,100
The castle is at the entrance point to your world. In short, the weapons will all pass through your castle.

200
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Is that what you want?

201
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Um, well, more weapon things coming to take over my castle. What about my privacy?!

202
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:16,100
I understand, Bowser. I understand. I, too, have little to no privacy.

203
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Yikes. This isn't good and far. Good at all. In fact, the strings!

204
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:27,100
But I just can't be pals with these nincompoops. I got an image to keep up.

205
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:39,100
He cares about his image! It's okay! We're cool! Sort of! Kind of!

206
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Yeah!

207
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:50,100
I've got it! No one insults Bowser's minions and gets away with it! I've got a bone to pick with the smithy guy!

208
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Come on, Mario! Let's teach him a lesson right now, together!

209
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,100
I'm so sly!

210
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,100
It looks like we're together on this one. Let's go.

211
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,100
He's so soon!

212
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,100
What's this do?

213
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Wait! I can just fucking leave?! I can just fucking leave?!

214
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:38,100
That's so funny that I can just fucking leave.

215
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Oh, this animation's kind of cute, though.

216
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Do we have everything we need, those senpai?

217
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Actually, let's go back.

218
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:37,100
There's only one thing I need, and I need, um...

219
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,100
Coolix? I think I'm not strong enough for Coolix.

220
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Frog coin and fourium, hold on.

221
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,100
I got a lot of these.

222
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Oh, it's a panel card holder! What can I get you?

223
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,100
All members fully heal.

224
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Where can I get more FP stuff?

225
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Where can I get more FP stuff? You know, to heal my FP.

226
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Like, I want to heal all of my FP, maybe here?

227
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:01,100
So, whatever you're... hold on, hold on. Let me look.

228
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:09,100
I want this one, Royal Syrup!

229
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:16,100
I want more of that!

230
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Is this just not a thing I can get?

231
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:49,100
I can't buy Royal Syrup, but I want it!

232
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,100
And that's fine.

233
00:39:54,100 --> 00:40:04,100
Oh, that sucks.

234
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Well, that sucks. I've got enough stuff. Okay.

235
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Hold up, let me save first.

236
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Hold on, let me save first, so I can...

237
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Do you have any red essence?

238
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Oops, not that one, hold on.

239
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:55,100
No. What is that?

240
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,100
Where can I get this red essence?

241
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Is it blood? Is it the blood of my enemies?

242
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Well, okay, we have a choice, Empire.

243
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Do I fucking die and fight that Final Fantasy-esque character?

244
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:39,100
Or do I fight the main boss and finish the game?

245
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Everyone, I see a few people... majority of people do the Final Fantasy guy.

246
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Okay, we'll do the Final Fantasy guy.

247
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,100
What's the Final Fantasy guy again?

248
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Yeah, here.

249
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Also, if I jinx if you haven't done the rematches, I haven't.

250
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:35,100
Okay.

251
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,100
I'm gonna suffer.

252
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:45,100
My jinx is up there.

253
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Time to show the power of polygons and things and stuff.

254
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,100
You wish to challenge me? Yeah.

255
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Alright, you asked for it. No crying if you get hurt.

256
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:02,100
I'll cry only a little bit.

257
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:09,100
This is where all things don't work.

258
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Dang it.

259
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Oh, well, I'm pretty strong enough.

260
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Think I can jump on him?

261
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:53,100
No, he's too small.

262
00:43:53,100 --> 00:44:08,100
No! He barely took any damage! It only works on Exor, cries.

263
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:17,100
Oh, I can do a group hug again.

264
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:24,100
Bino beam!

265
00:44:47,100 --> 00:45:07,100
Ah, you missed! Okay, we can do this.

266
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:25,100
Ow, I'm so slow with blocking.

267
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:30,100
Oh, I beat my record!

268
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:35,100
I beat my record just by a tiny little bit.

269
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:47,100
Just by your, like, one!

270
00:45:47,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Oops.

271
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,100
Sorry, I'm still trying to get 30. Ah, shit!

272
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:14,100
Heal is simply amazing. We did it.

273
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,100
Still haven't had enough? It isn't often I have someone this competitive to spar with.

274
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Alright, since this match will be the one that counts, since I'm placing my reputation online.

275
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,100
Okay, give me one.

276
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:32,100
Give me a second. Can I heal here?

277
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:39,100
No. Where'd I heal? Here?

278
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:44,100
Oh wait, does he give me my heals back? I can't remember.

279
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,100
Oh yeah, I'm already healed.

280
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Oh yeah.

281
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,100
Okay, let's do it again. Yeah.

282
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:16,100
Watch closely. Jagger, you're about to see your sensei in action.

283
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:24,100
Ah, I missed! I'm such a fool.

284
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,100
Okay, that missed.

285
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:40,100
Sorry. I'm going to try this.

286
00:47:40,100 --> 00:48:03,100
Oh, I suck.

287
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:11,100
I'm just going to stick to this.

288
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:32,100
Ah, I'm getting worse!

289
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:46,100
Okay.

290
00:48:46,100 --> 00:49:01,100
Oh, I'm getting worse. Okay, come back!

291
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:06,100
Wee!

292
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:13,100
Missed. Ow. That was not good.

293
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:20,100
Now my hands are like not working.

294
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,100
I'll kiss. I'll kiss. I'll kiss.

295
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,100
Fuck! I want to get past 10 at that time.

296
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:42,100
Okay, um, karaoke.

297
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:47,100
Bowser?

298
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:57,100
Oh, resistance. Nice.

299
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:02,100
I was so good at it before.

300
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:18,100
What happened to me? What happened to me?

301
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:25,100
Hold on.

302
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:36,100
I was doing so well, and now I'm a failure.

303
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:46,100
What happened? What happened?

304
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:59,100
Okay.

305
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:12,100
Guys, do that.

306
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:16,100
Wee!

307
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:28,100
Barely does anything.

308
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:39,100
Okay, one more time.

309
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:46,100
Never mind. You're simply amazing.

310
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,100
Well, you're a stronger champion, no doubt about it.

311
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,100
My reputation was staked in this last fight, so I've lost a title of sensei.

312
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,100
From now on, you are the sensei of this dojo.

313
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:03,100
You take this belt, which only the highest ranking fighter in the dojo can wear.

314
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,100
You got a jinx belt.

315
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:10,100
You will rename the dojo, Mario style dojo, and incorporate your jump technique into the training.

316
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,100
Wait!

317
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,100
Wait, wait, wait, no!

318
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,100
Jager and I will start our training immediately.

319
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:32,100
1,000 warm-up jumps begin. Ready? Begin.

320
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:39,100
Mario sensei, the new gym, and we'll strengthen us, right?

321
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,100
Master, share your wisdom with us.

322
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:47,100
Wait, wait, I didn't want to be... He changed the sign!

323
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,100
Did he, like...

324
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,100
Did he add, like, a little thing?

325
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:58,100
The M looks so weird.

326
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,100
Did he add a cliff hit?

327
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:06,100
Ghost middle.

328
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,100
Emblem of power.

329
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,100
Look at that!

330
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Nice.

331
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:25,100
Let's go save.

332
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,100
I can't see the stats, but I bet they're good.

333
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:34,100
Um, hold on.

334
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:42,100
No, not that.

335
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,100
Can you see it now?

336
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:49,100
Trying my best. There we go.

337
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:58,100
Yeah.

338
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,100
Yeah.

339
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,100
Big numbers.

340
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,100
Attack merge!

341
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Give me a second then.

342
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:16,100
There, look at the attack!

343
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,100
There.

344
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,100
Big numbers.

345
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:28,100
I'm gonna put it back though.

346
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:32,100
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no.

347
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:44,100
Can I already save?

348
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:51,100
Um, next up...

349
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,100
It's this guy, right?

350
00:54:54,100 --> 00:55:10,100
We got everything, I think we're ready.

351
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:18,100
Let's go.

352
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,100
Greetings.

353
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:26,100
Wait, did I meet him before?

354
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,100
I thought I already met him before, am I?

355
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:36,100
I'll just do it again, I'll just do it again.

356
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:42,100
I am Kulix, Dark Knight of Vanda.

357
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,100
I have crossed into this dimension to fight the Dark Mage.

358
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:51,100
Who, you, who stand before me, where does your death come from?

359
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,100
Why are you surrendered so three-dimensionally?

360
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:00,100
The evil power that gave me life mapped out this flat plain as my form.

361
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:05,100
You were four from a power unknown to me.

362
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:10,100
I wish to gain the secret of your three-dimensional world.

363
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,100
Will you enter combat against me?

364
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:20,100
Unguard!

365
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,100
I am matter.

366
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,100
I am antimatter.

367
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,100
I can see your past.

368
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,100
I can see your future.

369
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,100
I consume time.

370
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:44,100
And I will consume you.

371
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:52,100
I think we gotta get rid of these crystals first, right?

372
00:56:52,100 --> 00:57:07,100
Oh!

373
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,100
What?

374
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,100
Oh, okay, we're doing good.

375
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,100
Okay, where were we fine?

376
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:21,100
Before this, this, okay, maybe we're not doing as fine.

377
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:30,100
That was a lot of stuff, but don't worry, we got this, probably.

378
00:57:52,100 --> 00:58:09,100
Okay.

379
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,100
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

380
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:21,100
Sorry, not that, I can, I just, something, just give me a second.

381
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,100
Give me a second, okay?

382
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,100
Sorry, I'll thank you for the five gifted.

383
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:32,100
No, no, no, not that, not that, sorry, I can, just something, just something.

384
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,100
Give me a second.

385
00:58:51,100 --> 00:59:20,100
Okay.

386
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:45,100
Okay.

387
00:59:45,100 --> 01:00:11,100
Okay.

388
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:38,100
Okay.

389
01:00:38,100 --> 01:01:06,100
Okay.

390
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:12,100
I'm so sorry about that.

391
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:27,100
I'm so sorry about that.

392
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:35,100
Everything should be okay, I think.

393
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:55,100
Should I buy this Mecha Koopa Stomp?

394
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,100
Oh shit, I missed that.

395
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,100
Peach is doing just fine.

396
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:04,100
Bowser, not as much.

397
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:15,100
Did I super jump on this Wind Crystal?

398
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:23,100
Oh, it worked, sort of.

399
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,100
Okay, everyone just live, please.

400
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:38,100
Good luck.

401
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:48,100
There you go.

402
01:02:48,100 --> 01:03:00,100
Hey.

403
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:15,100
Peach is like tanking everything.

404
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:32,100
Good luck.

405
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:40,100
I can't believe Peach is tanking everything so perfectly.

406
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:50,100
Although me, I'm not doing anything perfectly right now.

407
01:03:50,100 --> 01:04:06,100
I'm getting worse.

408
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:11,100
I'm gonna try switching.

409
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:21,100
Let's try Gino Flash.

410
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,100
And it's on!

411
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:45,100
Okay, that worked.

412
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:54,100
I need more of that.

413
01:04:54,100 --> 01:05:14,100
Yeah, Maple Syrup.

414
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:23,100
Oh.

415
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:32,100
Oh, that's kind of hard.

416
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:52,100
Come on, come back.

417
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:57,100
There we go.

418
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:09,100
Oh, not fireball, super jump.

419
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:13,100
Earth, water, which one next?

420
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:23,100
Crystal, fire crystal, water crystal.

421
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,100
Water next?

422
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:35,100
Fuck you, water.

423
01:06:55,100 --> 01:07:00,100
Okay, that's it for this video.

424
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:05,100
Thanks for watching.

425
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:50,100
For Peach.

426
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,100
There we go.

427
01:07:52,100 --> 01:08:14,100
Oh, yeah.

428
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:21,100
Okay, well, please come back.

429
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:31,100
Gino?

430
01:08:51,100 --> 01:09:01,100
I have an item to heal everyone.

431
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:31,100
Oh.

432
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:41,100
Can we mellow?

433
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:53,100
Can we mellow?

434
01:09:53,100 --> 01:10:05,100
Okay, let's have ourselves another Maple Syrup.

435
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:23,100
Oh, I got a freebie, nice.

436
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:31,100
Ow.

437
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:42,100
Earth crystal.

438
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,100
Earth crystal or fire crystal?

439
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:50,100
Do earth crystal.

440
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,100
There's, what happened to the animation?

441
01:10:53,100 --> 01:11:17,100
Fuck!

442
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:25,100
Shit. Shit.

443
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:31,100
Get in here, Bowser. Take Bowser.

444
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:05,100
Fuck this fire crystal.

445
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:54,100
How can this earth crystal be using water moves? I don't get it.

446
01:12:54,100 --> 01:13:21,100
I don't get it.

447
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:31,100
I don't get this bitch back.

448
01:13:51,100 --> 01:14:19,100
I keep on failing.

449
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:39,100
Oh, I blocked it. Yay!

450
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:59,100
Ah, you little shit.

451
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:26,100
Does the earth crystal? I don't know.

452
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:31,100
Probably not, huh?

453
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:35,100
Triple move.

454
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:40,100
No. That's... nah.

455
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:12,100
Okay, here we go.

456
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:26,100
He's just, like, carrying so hard.

457
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:52,100
I think everything's good.

458
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:59,100
Thank goodness.

459
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:07,100
Now we just have to slap this bitch.

460
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:12,100
Does this work on you?

461
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:16,100
No.

462
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:23,100
Just the man's left!

463
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:41,100
Well, I should probably group hug.

464
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:46,100
Shit.

465
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:51,100
Shell him.

466
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:55,100
Slap.

467
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,100
Oh my gosh, Peach.

468
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,100
Peach!

469
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:10,100
Peach! You're the MVP right now!

470
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:31,100
Ow.

471
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:36,100
Did we do it?

472
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:39,100
Woohoo!

473
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:48,100
Oh my gosh, look, we leveled up some!

474
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:53,100
Should we do more physical?

475
01:18:53,100 --> 01:19:05,100
Should we do more physical or more magic?

476
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:11,100
Magic? Okay.

477
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:24,100
All Bowser leveled up, too.

478
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:29,100
Magic?

479
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,100
Physical?

480
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:41,100
Bowser does pretty strong.

481
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:45,100
Okay, well, Bowser can get physical.

482
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:48,100
Ah, your spirit is strong.

483
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:52,100
This legendary strength is the power of that third dimension.

484
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:58,100
It is far mightier than the forces of malevolence could dream.

485
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:02,100
I will treasure this memento of my journey here.

486
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:08,100
Perhaps in another time, I will be able to do more physical.

487
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:18,100
I will be able to do more physical.

488
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:27,100
I will be able to do more physical.

489
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:33,100
Perhaps in another time, another game, we may have been mortal enemies.

490
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:37,100
Someday I will gain the power of this third dimension,

491
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:42,100
and those forces will visit a land not yet mapped until that time.

492
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,100
Take this.

493
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,100
Treasure it as a keepsake of our fight.

494
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,100
Got a quartz charm.

495
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,100
Farewell, champion knight.

496
01:20:54,100 --> 01:21:03,100
Goodbye, Tootie.

497
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:08,100
Well, I wonder what the piranha plant says now.

498
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,100
Your neighbor moved away.

499
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:29,100
Yeah.

500
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:38,100
Now I need to restock.

501
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:48,100
You have maple syrup? Yeah, you have tons of maple syrup.

502
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,100
Thank you, Enos, for this two super chat.

503
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:54,100
Mercy, do you plan on playing the Pulse game?

504
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:57,100
There's a Pulse game?

505
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:04,100
Oh, I gotta equip it, right.

506
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:16,100
Put it on.

507
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:22,100
Pino?

508
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:30,100
What does it do?

509
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,100
Force of shining power.

510
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,100
Oh, it's too weak.

511
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:46,100
Look, it's all red.

512
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:50,100
It just do anything.

513
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:59,100
Everything goes down.

514
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:05,100
The charm doesn't show the stat boosts it gives, but it's the most powerful item.

515
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:10,100
The hidden buff?

516
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:17,100
Well, who'd I give it to?

517
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,100
I guess I'll give it to Bowser then.

518
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:25,100
Here you go, Bowser.

519
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:31,100
Mario already has the jinx thing.

520
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:34,100
Okay.

521
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:41,100
Anything else we need? No, we're all good.

522
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,100
Okay, let's go fight the big bad now.

523
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,100
I'm so strong.

524
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,100
I'm such a player.

525
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,100
I'm such a god.

526
01:23:52,100 --> 01:24:06,100
I beat 2D, and now I gotta beat 3D.

527
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:12,100
Alright, let's go.

528
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:17,100
This animation is so cute.

529
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:22,100
Where's the 3D when? Oh, I want a 3D model so badly.

530
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:34,100
But, um...

531
01:24:34,100 --> 01:25:02,100
This is the part that's the hardest.

532
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,100
This is the part that's the hardest.

533
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:14,100
This is the hardest part.

534
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:19,100
No!

535
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,100
Please.

536
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:25,100
Okay.

537
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:30,100
Okay.

538
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:39,100
This is the hardest part.

539
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:06,100
Senpai!

540
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:11,100
Thank you, Misaka best for $1.99.

541
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,100
Super Cat, platforming my beloved.

542
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:18,100
And thank you for the $2.00, Super Cat, you know cheap.

543
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,100
Best of luck, Mercy, with Endgame also platforming.

544
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,100
Thank you.

545
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:29,100
Why is platforming so hard?

546
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:37,100
Senpai!

547
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,100
Mario, don't you fucking dare.

548
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:42,100
Thank you.

549
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:49,100
Senpai!

550
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:56,100
Thank you, Anonymous, for the $6.90 tip.

551
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:59,100
Good luck with the platforming, Kohai.

552
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,100
Thank you.

553
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:05,100
And thank you for the $5.00, Super...

554
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:12,100
Griffin, I was gonna say Mercy.

555
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:16,100
The one enemy, Mercy, has the hard time with platforming.

556
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:23,100
It's true.

557
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:30,100
Yeah!

558
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,100
Yeah, this is the best.

559
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:35,100
Yeah, I did it.

560
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:38,100
Yeah, first try, nobody saw the rest, right?

561
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,100
Nobody saw the other.

562
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,100
Please don't do this again.

563
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,100
I don't wanna do it again.

564
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:52,100
No!

565
01:27:52,100 --> 01:28:02,100
No!

566
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:11,100
No!

567
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:18,100
Hippopol?

568
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,100
No.

569
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:26,100
There's probably a super attack coming that I will need this for.

570
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:31,100
Alright, Gino Flash, let's go.

571
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:40,100
You know you're a gamer when your hands just are all super sweaty?

572
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:48,100
Oh!

573
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,100
Get hit!

574
01:28:50,100 --> 01:29:03,100
Get hit, get hit!

575
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:32,100
Why is this thing so stinking strong?

576
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,100
There we go.

577
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:41,100
Special enemies sometimes feel like they're stronger than, you know, regular.

578
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:47,100
Okay, you, you get magic because that's all you're good for.

579
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:54,100
And Gino, you also get magic because that's also what you're good for.

580
01:29:54,100 --> 01:30:23,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

581
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:30,100
Nobody did that.

582
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:34,100
Nobody did that.

583
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:39,100
Nobody noticed that.

584
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:44,100
Oh, that's nice.

585
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:52,100
Oh, man.

586
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:55,100
Oh, no.

587
01:30:55,100 --> 01:31:13,100
Which way do I go?

588
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:27,100
Oh, dui dui dui dui dui duii duii duii dui duii duii duii duii duii duii.

589
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:33,100
Prepare to die.

590
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:37,100
Oh, man.

591
01:31:43,100 --> 01:32:01,100
Therapy Mario, Wahoo, oops, not close enough, YAY!

592
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:11,100
Wow, I am so bad, oh well.

593
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:16,100
Oh!

594
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:20,100
Great Azura Raid!

595
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:27,100
Mario!

596
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:35,100
Bye Azura, bye Azura, welcome Azura, welcome Raiders!

597
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:40,100
It's me, Mercio, Mercio.

598
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:47,100
It's me, Wahoo!

599
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:52,100
How was this dream?

600
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:55,100
How was, did you do well in the club?

601
01:32:55,100 --> 01:33:13,100
No, I'm not the Mercy, today I'm a Mercio.

602
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:24,100
Lamao was very chaotic but super fun.

603
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:33,100
I'm glad, I'm glad, I saw a little bit of it and I saw everyone fall and I thought it was great.

604
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,100
Just like how I'm gonna fall.

605
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:43,100
Now, welcome everyone, welcome in, as you can see we are playing Mario RPG.

606
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,100
No, give me a second.

607
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:53,100
I meant, I meant, we are playing a Mercio RPG!

608
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:12,100
Okay, peachy, peachy, it's magic.

609
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,100
Excuse me.

610
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,100
Yeah!

611
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:27,100
I hate this, I hate platforming, platforming is my enemy.

612
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:49,100
A pizza, pasta, a pizza, pizza, pasta, put it in a box, bring it here and put it on my...

613
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,100
Fuck.

614
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:16,100
I'm going so slowly because I'm bad at this.

615
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,100
Yeah!

616
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,100
Is there anything over there?

617
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:25,100
Oh no, good.

618
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,100
I don't have to go that way.

619
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,100
What's this one?

620
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,100
What's this one over here?

621
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,100
Ah.

622
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:51,100
There's so many little guys, I'm able to push the button.

623
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,100
There's so many little guys.

624
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,100
Can I kill them all?

625
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:54,100
Can I kill all the little guys?

626
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,100
Die!

627
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:58,100
Die!

628
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:15,100
It's okay.

629
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:18,100
Understandable, have a nice day.

630
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:28,100
Understandable, have a nice day.

631
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:45,100
I wasn't familiar with your game, little guys.

632
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,100
Okay.

633
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:02,100
Oh, you got Ultra Hammer.

634
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:07,100
What's this over here?

635
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,100
Okay.

636
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,100
Okay.

637
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:15,100
Okay.

638
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,100
Okay.

639
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,100
Okay.

640
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:18,100
Okay.

641
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,100
Okay.

642
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:20,100
Okay.

643
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,100
Okay.

644
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,100
Okay.

645
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:23,100
Okay.

646
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:24,100
Okay.

647
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,100
Okay.

648
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,100
Okay.

649
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,100
Okay.

650
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,100
That was so mean.

651
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:28,100
This is so...

652
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:32,100
I've been wiping enemies left and right.

653
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,100
I was him until I was...

654
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:35,100
I wasn't...

655
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,100
I'm...

656
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,100
Shit.

657
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,100
It's a little nudge.

658
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:46,100
There we go.

659
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,100
It's tiniest.

660
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:51,100
Tiniest.

661
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,100
Tiniest.

662
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,100
Tiniest.

663
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,100
Okay.

664
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,100
Which way is it, Senpai?

665
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:08,100
Ah!

666
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:36,100
I'm not going to cry.

667
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,100
I'm not going to cry.

668
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:39,100
I'm not crying.

669
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:40,100
You're crying.

670
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,100
Okay.

671
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,100
Okay.

672
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,100
Okay.

673
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:57,100
Okay.

674
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,100
Okay.

675
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,100
Okay.

676
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:00,100
Okay.

677
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:01,100
Okay.

678
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,100
Okay.

679
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:07,100
That was so mean.

680
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,100
Okay.

681
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,100
Okay.

682
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,100
Yes!

683
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,100
Okay.

684
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:21,940
Fucking get hide.

685
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:29,660
It's a clock, it's Mario, it's Mario.

686
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,060
How did he get here?

687
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,300
He better do something.

688
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:38,980
Do I kill the ding-a-lings first or a ding-a-ding?

689
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,900
You know, flash!

690
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:54,100
Oh!

691
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,100
Whee!

692
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:04,620
Ah!

693
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,100
Not this move again.

694
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,620
One o'clock is time for ice storm!

695
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:21,620
I think we'll be okay.

696
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:31,620
I can do this again.

697
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:41,620
Peach is so strong now.

698
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:42,620
I'm so proud of Peach.

699
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:52,620
I can't block all good.

700
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:57,620
Ah!

701
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:58,620
Not the spores!

702
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:05,620
There we go.

703
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:10,620
Five o'clock, time to view the aurora!

704
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:13,620
Man.

705
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:15,620
Aw, man.

706
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:19,620
Get out of here, Bowser.

707
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:24,620
Good, one of them is dead.

708
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:29,620
Six o'clock, time to fully recover!

709
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:30,620
No way!

710
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:56,620
It's almost dead already!

711
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:57,620
Let's do a reverb.

712
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:20,620
Ten o'clock, time to draw a bath!

713
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:25,620
Aw, man.

714
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:31,620
Sorry, gotta drink, gotta drink.

715
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:38,620
Get the fuck out of here.

716
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:50,620
Ten o'clock, guess I'll break!

717
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:58,620
Ten o'clock, time to garden!

718
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:06,620
Group hug!

719
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:10,620
Come on!

720
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:16,620
Ten o'clock, it's high noon!

721
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:19,620
Luckily I faced this attack so many times already.

722
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,620
Fuck!

723
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:32,620
Come on, group hug!

724
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:34,620
Aw, thank goodness, it's over.

725
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:36,620
It's over!

726
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:38,620
This clock is stronger than I expected!

727
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:41,620
I didn't like it.

728
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:48,620
Aw, thank you for the save, point.

729
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,620
I have money!

730
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:55,620
Wee! Fuck!

731
01:44:55,620 --> 01:45:02,620
Money? What's this tiny little path?

732
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:04,620
Wee!

733
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:05,620
What?

734
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:09,620
Ah!

735
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:13,620
Where did it make me go?

736
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:15,620
Huh?

737
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:17,620
Oh, that's nice.

738
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:19,620
Oh, thank you.

739
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:42,620
Where am I supposed to go, though?

740
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:47,620
Aw, fuck.

741
01:45:47,620 --> 01:46:01,620
Aw, not these fake little guys again!

742
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:05,620
Oh, well, it's not bad.

743
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:19,620
Could be worse.

744
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:22,620
We are really doing okay, actually.

745
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:27,620
Fuck.

746
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:44,620
We're doing okay!

747
01:46:44,620 --> 01:47:02,620
Aw, no.

748
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,620
Oops.

749
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:16,620
Just time to massacre all of them.

750
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:20,620
Aw, man, not again.

751
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,620
Goodbye.

752
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:29,620
Goodbye, you little shit.

753
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:36,620
They're so weakly.

754
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:39,620
Are these all the, like, fake bosses and stuff?

755
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:46,620
Oh, my gosh, it is the fake bosses.

756
01:47:46,620 --> 01:48:03,620
Oh, hey, I'm pretty good at this, huh?

757
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:09,620
Okay, we're good.

758
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:16,620
Okay, let's do it. Where's the Yoshi?

759
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:22,620
Yeah! I still got it!

760
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:28,620
Oh, yeah.

761
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:58,620
I'm not doing much.

762
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:05,620
Alright, they're dead.

763
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:18,620
I forgot, they're dead. Therefore, where is it?

764
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:32,620
There we go.

765
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:36,620
Okay.

766
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:39,620
It's been in the middle again, right, guys?

767
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:47,620
Oh, yeah.

768
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:51,620
What's this way?

769
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:59,620
Am I allowed to see?

770
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:04,620
Wait.

771
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:08,620
Oh, there's a box here. Don't want it.

772
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:10,620
Max mushroom, nice.

773
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:15,620
Well, over here.

774
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:17,620
There's stuff over there, too.

775
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:23,620
Come on.

776
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:24,620
I'm greedy.

777
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:30,620
Ah!

778
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:33,620
I was too greedy.

779
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:41,620
Oh, unofficial harem raid, what happened?

780
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:52,620
Hello, everyone!

781
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:54,620
How are you?

782
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:56,620
Wait, what happened? Why is it unofficial?

783
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:59,620
But welcome, everyone!

784
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:02,620
Welcome to the stream!

785
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:04,620
Excuse me.

786
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:08,620
Oh, sorry. I mean, welcome to the stream!

787
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:17,620
It's me, Murcio!

788
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:19,620
She was so tired, she forgot to raid.

789
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:22,620
Okay, fair, fair, fair, fair, fair.

790
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:24,620
Oh, thank you, thank you.

791
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:31,620
Thank you for the unofficial raid, my sister Shibi.

792
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:36,620
Y'all know who I am, so that's okay.

793
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:40,620
Can I bitch slap a ghost? Yes.

794
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:49,620
What is it?

795
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:53,620
Oh, that was a really strong move! Yay!

796
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:56,620
Yay!

797
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:06,620
Bowser, you got the stuff! Let's get physical! Yeah!

798
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:09,620
Yeah.

799
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:12,620
Oh, wait, no, I didn't mean it. I didn't mean that.

800
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:29,620
Ah!

801
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:32,620
Oh, we're good. Fuck, yeah.

802
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:35,620
Oh, I didn't see that. Yeah, box!

803
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:39,620
Oh, syrup! Yay, syrup! Fuck!

804
01:52:39,620 --> 01:53:00,620
Ha ha ha ha!

805
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:02,620
Okay, Peach, you tried your best, but that's okay.

806
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:05,620
You're not here to hit. You're here.

807
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:09,620
Oh, I blocked it! Yeah, fuck yeah!

808
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:14,620
I'm a god of gaming!

809
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:18,620
Wee!

810
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:21,620
Ow.

811
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:25,620
Okay, Peach, I need your help later. Thanks.

812
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:30,620
Can we get a group hug? Yeah, let's do a group hug.

813
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:38,620
Aha!

814
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:43,620
I blocked it!

815
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:48,620
I'm so proud of myself.

816
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:53,620
Ooh, Mario leveled up again!

817
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:55,620
Physical?

818
01:53:55,620 --> 01:54:00,620
Magic. Ah, it's physical. Yeah, that was a good one.

819
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:03,620
Oh, Malo too!

820
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:05,620
Magic!

821
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:11,620
Ha ha ha!

822
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:14,620
Wait, where did I run?

823
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:17,620
Wait, did I run backwards?

824
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:21,620
Wait, did I run backwards?

825
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,620
Yeah, I went backwards.

826
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:29,620
Wait, I won it all that way, and then I forgot everything, and I'm so stupid.

827
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:32,620
I'm so stupid. It was the other way.

828
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:37,620
Hmm, what?

829
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:48,620
Ah!

830
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:05,080
That was my bad

831
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:18,300
That was uh, yeah, that was uh

832
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:36,380
Oopsies, that was oh, yeah, that was me

833
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:55,660
I think I got like a flower thing in a while already got this that was my bad

834
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:05,020
Oh

835
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:15,580
Okay, we're good. We're good good gaming

836
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:44,140
Okay ghost nobody cares about ghosts

837
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:51,820
Come on Bowser. You can beat up a ghost. I know you can beat up a ghost. Everyone can beat up ghosts

838
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:54,300
Ah

839
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:05,980
They are really good at hp stuff though. I'm not hp leveling up. Oh these good

840
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:09,580
They're pretty good at leveling up

841
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:17,740
Oh shit

842
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:22,220
I'm missing them

843
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:35,100
There you go

844
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:40,300
Exp grind

845
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:51,100
It's okay. We're almost there. I think we're almost there

846
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:15,740
Can't use x. Okay, that's fine never needed x anyways

847
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,300
Oh

848
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:27,820
Goodbye forever

849
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:35,820
Oh

850
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:39,820
What is this I have to fight all of them

851
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:49,980
Oh

852
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:58,780
All right

853
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:01,740
Group hug

854
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:04,620
There we go

855
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:07,420
Oh

856
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:17,740
I didn't even hit anyone yet

857
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:19,740
Oh

858
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:35,980
There we go

859
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:44,460
Ah, I ain't close enough. I always get the first move

860
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:46,700
Oh

861
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:49,020
Unfair really

862
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:16,460
Oh

863
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:39,100
Mario wake the fuck up

864
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,460
Oh

865
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,260
Oh, we're good

866
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:55,260
We got another royal syrup that's good

867
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,380
Ah

868
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:00,620
I don't I don't know if I can

869
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:16,620
Oh

870
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:22,620
Bowser can technically heal up like that, but I'm gonna do a group hug anyways

871
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,980
Yeah for good

872
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:48,380
You put syrup in the box. This is just an item grind now

873
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:16,700
I'm still

874
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:31,260
Still kind of bad

875
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:47,180
Oh

876
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:50,140
What happened to all the exclamation marks

877
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:55,820
What happened to the exclamation marks for how I time things

878
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:11,980
I miss it

879
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:16,460
Oh

880
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:47,420
I

881
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:57,100
Missed my exclamation mark and helped me so much. I need my visual cues

882
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:02,700
I think I'm good, but I'm actually a lie

883
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,700
And another one

884
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:16,460
Oh

885
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:26,460
No a only why that's fine

886
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:31,420
Let's get my practice in

887
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:41,100
That was not much practice in

888
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:43,180
Oh

889
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:01,500
There we go

890
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:13,100
Oh

891
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,660
Didn't do much though

892
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:43,100
Oh

893
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:59,420
There's it

894
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:07,500
Keep the syrup look at a freebie

895
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:13,980
Oh

896
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:16,300
There you go

897
02:06:18,220 --> 02:06:20,220
Yeah

898
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:28,940
We did it we did it I got things and stuff get over here. Yeah

899
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:32,700
Save yeah

900
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:37,900

907
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:09,980

910
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:23,260
Hmm this hole

911
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:40,060
Maybe I do have to beat him and then it'll hop it'll open the hole

912
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:49,900
Oh, it's easier than I thought

913
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:53,900

916
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:20,460

917
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:22,860

926
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:34,700
I

927
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:40,940
Take down the pilot

928
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:05,340

933
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:53,900

Production on schedule

940
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:57,820
This despite the fact that clay Morton Boyer

941
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:03,420
Spirit of itch and axon rangers were defeated this rage. Smithy will have a new army in no time

942
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:10,380
A new army you can't be making more weapons. Haven't you caused enough trouble already?

943
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:16,220
Oh, yeah, who are you that shovel knight?

944
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:24,780
This is the Mario give up now you still have a chance

945
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:41,260
It's like a what what like Kirby shovel knight, but like not even meadow knight meta shovel knight

946
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:48,220
You

02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:55,180
Love now you still have a chance

948
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:03,420
Lowdown shut down production now or he'll stop you

949
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:07,740
What do you say you'll a puffball mad mallet trash him

950
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:18,220
You

951
02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:25,820

All right, let's see what you got just like just like

02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:48,460
All right, never mind. Okay. What do you have now?

954
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:59,260
Actually, let's get these mad mallet guys out of the way first

955
02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:04,620
Actually now

956
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:10,300
This attack in they're useless. Oh, that was easy

957
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:12,300
You

958
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:28,860
I hope you learned your lesson. We're almost there Mario. Come on

959
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:40,860
What do you suppose the switch does? Hmm nothing's happening

960
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:49,420
Oh, what's with the funny face mario? Oh, I know you trying to make me look aren't you? I'm not gonna fall for that one

961
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:55,820
Ah, kill me mario. Why do you always get yourself in trouble like this?

962
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:59,580
Boy, that was scary. I guess the green switch controls the crane

963
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:07,740
What I knew with the crane

964
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:12,140
Mario

965
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:14,540
Wait Mario

966
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:19,100
Give me a second

967
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:21,260
Oh

968
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:25,980
I finally made it up here

969
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:37,100
Let me help you out guys out for princess

970
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:44,460
I'm sorry. I snuck out without telling you or the chancellor. I just wanted to get back to normal

971
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:46,620
I want to do my part to help

972
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:49,580
Princess

973
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:55,420
Yes, that's it. Any job that lets me help both mario and the princess is worthwhile

974
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:07,820
Oh, what can you do to help? Well, I carried all I could now. What could you use?

975
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:12,700
Wait, you still expect me to pay money for this? Oh wait, these are cheap

976
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:18,620
I

977
02:16:28,060 --> 02:16:30,060
Think I can still do that

978
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:42,140
Apple cola doesn't really like do much, huh?

979
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:49,100
Sure

980
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:53,660
Okay, never mind, uh, I'm I'm set

981
02:16:55,260 --> 02:17:00,700
I'm set. This is for you. Got rock candy. What rock candy in storage box?

982
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:06,380
Thank you toad. We're almost there. Come on. Let's show them

983
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:19,100
Here's the report

984
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:21,980
Third drill bit will be finished on time

985
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:25,180
We're ahead of schedule

986
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:27,420
I'll make this smithy proud

987
02:17:28,060 --> 02:17:31,500
Good work, everyone. The work harder we work the stronger smithy will become

988
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:41,180
Weapons we manufacture here will be just think of it now. This is shovel night middle shovel night another shovel night another metal shovel night

989
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:43,580
Oh

990
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:46,940
When smithy takes over mario's world we can do anything we want

991
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,900
Not so fast

992
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:00,540
The last one was boba fat. That's true

993
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:08,140
You sure are a cocky bunch. I rule this world. Don't you forget it?

994
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:12,540
It's mario the clay mornin and speardovitch clones didn't stop him

995
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:17,180
No, no leave mario out of this. I'm the one you need to worry about not him

996
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:23,740
Mario you're gonna make you're about to make the longest jump of your life. You're ignoring me

997
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:40,140
So

998
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:10,380
Hey

999
02:19:18,540 --> 02:19:20,540
Yay

1000
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:26,940
We're almost there. Um wow

1001
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:31,260
Like the moon over

1002
02:19:32,220 --> 02:19:36,860
The day my genius and brawn are lost on these fools

1003
02:19:40,300 --> 02:19:43,980
Oh, he's batting his back. Um, well

1004
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:49,020
Oh look they're getting like spray painted here

1005
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:56,380
Another one

1006
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:59,100
You

1007
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:06,780
There are you the one in charge here, do you know what your weapons have been doing to our world stop this nonsense at once

1008
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:16,060
I'm afraid that is impossible any descent against smithy will be dealt with by immediate meltdown

1009
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:21,500
Meltdown you can't scare me. I've got mario by my side

1010
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:27,020
The centers will be eliminated production will continue. All right

1011
02:20:33,580 --> 02:20:35,580
Oh the girls pound it

1012
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:47,580
Out

1013
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:53,500

You saw that, right? Oh, yeah. Oh the block. Oh, yeah

1018
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:30,860
Okay

1019
02:21:34,380 --> 02:21:38,460
Oh, it's still at its beer, I guess

1020
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:43,740
Oh, even if I block them it still did the thing

1021
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:07,660
Oh, yeah

1022
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:10,460
Oh

1023
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:24,140
Mario should I do physical again, I'll go with physical

1024
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:27,820
Malo

1025
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:30,780

1026
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:33,340
You know also magic

1027
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:40,700
Oh

1028
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:46,780
That was scary

1029
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:50,700
Oh, we can't run away now. We've got to kick those low lives out of our world

1030
02:22:52,060 --> 02:22:54,060
Okay, okay

1031
02:22:58,540 --> 02:23:00,540
Yeah

1032
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:11,340
Really

1033
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:17,580
Mario I'm surprised you're here

1034

I

1043
02:24:14,780 --> 02:24:16,940
Why is it always gotta be stinking eggs?

Okay, Mario you need a little bit of therapy. Okay, tell me about your feelings

1047
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:49,100
I should have done a group heal. That was my bad

1048
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:56,700

Hmm the production line hasn't halted look Mario this is where the weapons come from

1053
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:38,780
This must be where smithy makes his weapons

1054
02:26:39,740 --> 02:26:43,420
Find the last star piece and stuff the factory you've got to defeat him first

03:01:34,640 --> 03:01:36,640
Oh

1305
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:39,840

I like this guy. I like booster. He's so stupid

1307
03:01:57,520 --> 03:01:59,520
You like Mario games are really fun

1308
03:02:00,720 --> 03:02:04,240
Uh, the first Mario game that I actually played to completion

1309
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:09,280
I feel is uh really really really kind of dumb is um

1310
03:02:10,800 --> 03:02:17,440
A lot of people will probably be like what this is uh mario odyssey. I finished mario odyssey

1311
03:02:25,360 --> 03:02:27,920
That was the only one I did and then

1312
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:38,160
Why is that silly because it's one of the later ones right

1313
03:02:40,320 --> 03:02:43,840
It's one of the later ones. I did the odyssey. Yeah less

1314
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:46,800
platforming let's let's just say

1315
03:02:47,280 --> 03:02:49,280
Way less platforming

1316
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:55,200
I I always thought it's kind of dumb because like people will be like oh that was your first one. It's so

1317
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:57,680
recent

1318
03:02:57,680 --> 03:03:00,180
And then after that I uh

1319
03:03:04,880 --> 03:03:07,520
Oh like this lineup oh it's 3d now

1320
03:03:10,160 --> 03:03:12,160
Uh

1321
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:17,200
After that I uh played

1322
03:03:19,760 --> 03:03:21,760
After that I I

1323
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:27,360
Inherited every every system that I got right now. So then I played

1324
03:03:28,240 --> 03:03:31,280
Um, what was it then I played

1325
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:36,400
Thousand-year door. I don't think that one had a lot of platforming either

1326
03:03:40,400 --> 03:03:42,400
So

1327
03:03:42,720 --> 03:03:45,200
And in my past life I played uh

1328
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:49,600
Super star saga

1329
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:55,280
Which I also didn't think don't think it had a lot of platforming either

1330
03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:12,240
So

1331
03:04:13,760 --> 03:04:17,440
Maybe it's the isometric part that's that's killing me

1332
03:04:25,760 --> 03:04:27,760
Oh, there's you know

1333
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:41,840

03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:46,800
Saw a bright light through the window during the night. I believe it came from star hill

1401
03:12:47,360 --> 03:12:49,840
I only go find out what may have caused it

1402
03:12:50,400 --> 03:12:52,400

03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:48,640
Can't recall the star being here before it must be from where the light came came from

1429
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:54,160
It seems to be a few others perhaps some new wishes have fallen here the frog sage might know more

1430
03:15:57,040 --> 03:16:00,800
Can I look at their wishes I hope this is my big break

1431
03:16:04,240 --> 03:16:06,240
That's something special to show off

1432
03:16:06,240 --> 03:16:08,240
Oh

03:16:16,960 --> 03:16:18,960
These ones are new right

1434
03:16:18,960 --> 03:16:25,360

1435
03:16:26,720 --> 03:16:28,720
Wait a second

1436
03:16:29,360 --> 03:16:32,080

1437
03:16:36,720 --> 03:16:43,440
No, he's back. I mentioned for a heated duel

1438
03:16:44,720 --> 03:16:48,320
Everyone wants to fight me. No, I don't want to be as a little guy

1439
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:56,160
I wish someone could do something about this cake

03:18:52,560 --> 03:18:54,880
That's like the looms up to his old tricks again

1453

03:20:28,560 --> 03:20:31,760
He seems really riled up. I think he's scarier than the last time we saw him

1466
03:20:31,760 --> 03:20:38,240
Is there any way for one of my minions to talk get it together

You're right. He's tougher than last time but so am I

We've beat him twice and now we can do it again. I'm not letting him push me around

A long time ago. I chose them a long time ago like maybe a month ago

03:42:06,960 --> 03:42:09,280
I

1575
03:42:37,120 --> 03:42:39,120
I

1576
03:42:50,320 --> 03:42:52,820
Why is this so freaking tanky

1577
03:43:06,960 --> 03:43:09,920
You shut up as well

1578
03:43:37,200 --> 03:43:39,200

Feeling when only 31 exp only 31, huh?

1586
03:44:44,160 --> 03:44:46,400
Looks like philum spit something out. What is that thing?

03:44:48,800 --> 03:44:51,520
Oh the stick might be you want my grandpa's

1588
03:44:52,720 --> 03:44:54,720
What how could you tell?

1589
03:44:55,040 --> 03:44:57,360
Because he once told me that he lost it around here somewhere

1590
03:44:58,080 --> 03:45:05,920
Well, that makes it yours, right? You're the spell slinger of the team. So if anyone can use that thing, it's you

1591
03:45:15,280 --> 03:45:17,280
That was brutal

1592
03:45:17,840 --> 03:45:19,920
Who suggested I need I do post game

1593
03:45:20,640 --> 03:45:23,840
Grandpa, I'll take the stick you left behind and put it to go good use

1594
03:45:28,080 --> 03:45:34,400
Now that you finished the game sound player and player report have been added to the journal

1595
03:45:35,520 --> 03:45:41,520
Now that you've cleared the game the names of monsters that work question mark question mark question mark in the monster list have been unlocked

1596
03:45:50,720 --> 03:45:52,720

1598
03:45:58,080 --> 03:46:01,280
Never mind get me back in here

1599
03:46:11,760 --> 03:46:13,760

03:47:12,800 --> 03:47:14,800
Anxiety to

1608
03:47:17,520 --> 03:47:19,520
I

1609
03:47:40,000 --> 03:47:45,600
Didn't think it would be this bad co-eye. I'm sorry. Don't hurt me pls zero

1610
03:47:48,240 --> 03:47:50,240
Thank you for the late

1611
03:47:52,640 --> 03:47:56,080
I didn't even have to read that because text-to-speech work zero

1612
03:47:57,200 --> 03:48:03,680
It was the it was the semi colon zero semi colon cry face

1613
03:48:13,360 --> 03:48:16,480
I wonder if the expert bomb maker ever stopped making bombs

1614
03:48:17,280 --> 03:48:19,280
I

1615
03:48:31,360 --> 03:48:33,360
Who is the one that did bombs

1616
03:48:38,800 --> 03:48:41,840
Legendary Puccinello. Oh shit. Who is that again?

1617
03:48:42,640 --> 03:48:48,480
Thank you, Tygavia. Which of the new amongst your favorite my personal favorite

1618
03:48:51,440 --> 03:48:53,440
Is

1619
03:49:00,160 --> 03:49:02,160
Hold on. Let me check my list again

1620
03:49:04,800 --> 03:49:07,840
Wait that means I have to change my monitor give me a second

1621
03:49:12,000 --> 03:49:14,000
I

1622
03:49:23,600 --> 03:49:26,080
Gotta pull it up strong you sent it to me recently

1623
03:49:31,520 --> 03:49:34,160
Yes, let's see my favorite

1624
03:49:36,240 --> 03:49:38,240
Is probably um

1625
03:49:38,240 --> 03:49:40,000
the

1626
03:49:40,000 --> 03:49:42,000
Is probably that to hit head up

1627
03:50:00,000 --> 03:50:03,600
That one's my favorite followed by

1628
03:50:04,160 --> 03:50:06,160
I

1629
03:50:07,760 --> 03:50:09,920
The really tired looking one

1630
03:50:12,800 --> 03:50:21,120
The tired looking one drinking from a mug, which I usually drink my tea from a mug, but you can always interpret it as coffee

1631
03:50:33,920 --> 03:50:35,920
And then

1632
03:50:37,120 --> 03:50:40,800
Also the the one with the my my face, you know the

1633
03:50:42,320 --> 03:50:46,080
You can't see it because it's being covered, but you know the face

1634
03:50:48,960 --> 03:50:51,120
There yeah that one

1635
03:50:53,920 --> 03:50:57,920
That one you spam it if I do like the focus and then my my my

1636
03:50:58,720 --> 03:51:02,400
My mouth turns into like the the the upside down V

1637
03:51:04,080 --> 03:51:06,080
Yeah

1638
03:51:10,240 --> 03:51:12,240
Yeah, when I'm locked in

1639
03:51:20,880 --> 03:51:27,040
Because I notice my face I do that a lot. Yeah, I personally picked all of these ones myself

1640
03:51:28,000 --> 03:51:35,440
There's also a sneezing one for any time I sneeze you can just spam the sneeze one and since we've learned a lot and

1641
03:51:36,080 --> 03:51:38,080
We learn a lot in this stream

1642
03:51:39,040 --> 03:51:42,320
Uh, I also have a sensei emote

1643
03:51:45,040 --> 03:51:47,040
Yeah

1644
03:51:47,040 --> 03:51:49,040
Actually it uh

1645
03:51:49,040 --> 03:51:51,680
It it transfers pretty well like I can see

1646
03:51:53,040 --> 03:51:56,080
It pretty well from a distance the sneeze one. I think that's pretty good

1647
03:51:57,760 --> 03:51:59,760
I

1648
03:52:04,080 --> 03:52:06,480
That was you spitting on us. No, it's supposed to be a sneeze like

1649
03:52:10,640 --> 03:52:14,880
It can also be a spit take, you know like what the fuck did he just say?

1650
03:52:28,000 --> 03:52:34,880
No, that would be she be you know what I mean

1651
03:52:42,560 --> 03:52:46,560
Oh, I should probably move this to the other screen you gotta gotta see it

1652
03:52:48,000 --> 03:52:52,800
And then the rest are just kind of like general I feel like would be used quite a bit

1653
03:52:57,680 --> 03:53:00,400
I can't remember who's who

1654
03:53:04,800 --> 03:53:06,800
I'm miserable though

1655
03:53:12,320 --> 03:53:14,720
How many how many of these can I even buy?

1656
03:53:16,720 --> 03:53:18,720
Yeah, we have two crying motes now

1657
03:53:19,200 --> 03:53:23,600
So one is for tear and the other one is like sobbing

1658
03:53:24,720 --> 03:53:26,720
You get what I mean

1659
03:53:28,000 --> 03:53:30,000
Ah

1660
03:53:34,240 --> 03:53:36,240
Two completely different emotions

1661
03:53:50,560 --> 03:53:52,560
Like the first one is kind of like

1662
03:53:53,520 --> 03:53:57,120
Um like kind of frustrated maybe a little bit sad

1663
03:54:00,320 --> 03:54:02,560
And then just sobbing

1664
03:54:04,800 --> 03:54:08,160
It's pretty much I call myself a crybaby all the time because I am

1665
03:54:13,040 --> 03:54:16,160
So I have to go back up there. I don't want to do it

1666
03:54:16,560 --> 03:54:23,360
I feel like one one post credit thing was enough. I feel like I can't do it anymore, you know

1667
03:54:26,720 --> 03:54:28,720
Like my life is just over

1668
03:54:47,120 --> 03:54:50,720
I have to do more on this fight

1669
03:54:53,600 --> 03:54:59,200
I don't want to do any money fight. I need them already. Why do I have to do them again?

1670
03:54:59,440 --> 03:55:01,440
But

1671
03:55:10,960 --> 03:55:17,200
I have to go through back through this way I have to go through the whole thing again

1672
03:55:22,560 --> 03:55:25,840
It's kind of miserable because these fights are so damn long

1673
03:55:30,160 --> 03:55:32,160
So

1674
03:55:44,320 --> 03:55:46,320
No recovered fast

1675
03:55:47,600 --> 03:55:50,960
Will you play the og final fancies? Maybe

1676
03:55:51,920 --> 03:55:53,920
Maybe

1677
03:55:55,440 --> 03:56:00,720
I guess if like a lot of supplies are really into it. I've never been like the uh, what do you call?

1678
03:56:02,160 --> 03:56:04,160
I've never been the um

1679
03:56:04,960 --> 03:56:08,880
Biggest fan of final fantasy. What's going on here?

1680
03:56:10,080 --> 03:56:12,080
All right. I owe you for saving my kids

1681
03:56:13,520 --> 03:56:16,640
Okay, you want to hear the mobile blues? Well, all right

1682
03:56:17,600 --> 03:56:19,600
I get deep in the mines

1683
03:56:20,480 --> 03:56:22,080
wait

1684
03:56:22,080 --> 03:56:24,080
Don't get much sun

1685
03:56:26,640 --> 03:56:28,640
Wait, why is there letters in here?

1686
03:56:38,480 --> 03:56:40,480
Why why is there some some letters

1687
03:56:42,160 --> 03:56:44,400
Higher oh wait. Oh, I see

1688
03:56:45,360 --> 03:56:47,360
The

1689
03:56:49,200 --> 03:56:55,200
I'm covered with soil till my work day is done. Okay. I really hate sin. It's labor

1690
03:56:55,200 --> 03:56:59,680
I choose because that's the tea time to do them all fill blues

1691
03:57:04,160 --> 03:57:06,160
Oh, sorry

1692
03:57:06,320 --> 03:57:13,440
Sorry, I missed the dono jo. Yo, stop it. Thank you tiny spiny for the 3 3 3 in case some of you didn't know

1693
03:57:13,520 --> 03:57:17,440
Some of mercy's laughs are so high-pitched and they can only be heard by dogs and cats

1694
03:57:17,840 --> 03:57:21,040
Mercy is a pet friendly streamer because of this both

1695
03:57:21,920 --> 03:57:24,640
For her senpai's as pets and her senpai's

1696
03:57:26,480 --> 03:57:30,560
You know, it's so crazy. It's true though. It's true senpai

1697
03:57:34,560 --> 03:57:41,280
It's true senpai sometimes my uh laugh gets so high-pitched it doesn't even get caught on the mic

1698
03:57:44,160 --> 03:57:46,160
Ow

1699
03:57:55,200 --> 03:57:57,520
Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Where'd he run?

1700
03:58:03,920 --> 03:58:05,920
Oh, it's blocked now

1701
03:58:13,440 --> 03:58:15,440
Oh

1702
03:58:43,440 --> 03:58:45,440
Oh

1703
03:58:49,120 --> 03:58:52,640
Fuck I got stuck well, let's fight

1704
03:59:07,760 --> 03:59:09,760
But

1705
03:59:10,240 --> 03:59:14,800
Oh, he's back. Oh, it's hell. Oh, I have to go through all of them

1706
03:59:25,280 --> 03:59:29,600
Finally showed up ever since you people beat me. I've been refining my technique this time

1707
03:59:29,680 --> 03:59:32,240
I'm sure to win fame and fortune here. I come

1708
03:59:33,200 --> 03:59:37,200
Muahaha, you think you can beat me and my minions this I'd like to see

1709
03:59:37,920 --> 03:59:41,280
Bowser's already famous in his own right. Wouldn't you agree?

1710
03:59:43,120 --> 03:59:47,200
You know it. I was known as terror on two legs before you came onto the scene

1711
03:59:49,280 --> 03:59:53,680
There you have it fame and fortune are yours assuming you can win shall we find out?

1712
03:59:55,520 --> 03:59:58,720
You're the famous Bowser the chain chop and slinging one

1713
03:59:59,520 --> 04:00:03,760
That's fine. I didn't bring bombs this time and I'm made in shield to back them up

1714
04:00:04,240 --> 04:00:09,920
Good luck finding any holes in this defense much higher level now defeating the famous Bowser and his minion

1715
04:00:09,920 --> 04:00:12,720
who catapult me into unprecedented fame and fortune

1716
04:00:17,200 --> 04:00:24,640
This is the perfect shield and these incredible bombs can destroy anything the level up me can't lose

1717
04:00:28,960 --> 04:00:30,960
Oh

1718
04:00:31,200 --> 04:00:33,200
I don't want to do this

1719
04:00:36,640 --> 04:00:40,720
How bad is it pretty fucking bad

1720
04:00:58,720 --> 04:01:00,720
Oh

1721
04:01:00,720 --> 04:01:03,040
Oh

1722
04:01:31,600 --> 04:01:33,600
Oh

1723
04:01:37,760 --> 04:01:39,760
Mario's not having a good time

1724
04:01:47,600 --> 04:01:49,600
I'm not having a good time

1725
04:02:01,280 --> 04:02:03,280
Oh

1726
04:02:03,600 --> 04:02:05,600
Yeah on time, baby

1727
04:02:07,520 --> 04:02:09,520
Can I do a fireball?

1728
04:02:31,520 --> 04:02:33,520
Haven't I figured it out yet?

1729
04:02:35,040 --> 04:02:37,040
Got to turn all of them

1730
04:02:40,720 --> 04:02:42,720
Oh, yeah, I got to turn all of them then

1731
04:02:53,280 --> 04:02:55,280
Fuck

1732
04:03:01,680 --> 04:03:03,680
I

1733
04:03:05,440 --> 04:03:07,440
Can't tell how I turn them though

1734
04:03:19,760 --> 04:03:21,760
Just just hit them hard enough

1735
04:03:24,880 --> 04:03:26,880
Why is he hitting so damn hard?

1736
04:03:27,840 --> 04:03:29,840
Oh

1737
04:03:32,000 --> 04:03:34,000
It's the wrong one

1738
04:03:57,840 --> 04:03:59,840
This is miserable

1739
04:04:19,920 --> 04:04:21,920
Oh come on

1740
04:04:27,200 --> 04:04:29,200
Oh

1741
04:04:36,080 --> 04:04:39,040
Why am I timing so so so badly

1742
04:04:43,760 --> 04:04:45,760
Bowser out of here

1743
04:04:56,880 --> 04:04:58,880
Oh

1744
04:05:21,680 --> 04:05:23,680
Come on

1745
04:05:27,760 --> 04:05:29,760
Oh

1746
04:05:52,320 --> 04:05:54,320
There I go

1747
04:05:57,280 --> 04:05:59,280
Fuck

1748
04:06:02,480 --> 04:06:05,120
Okay, I need the princess to be alive

1749
04:06:26,880 --> 04:06:28,880
Oh

1750
04:06:51,840 --> 04:06:53,840
And

1751
04:06:57,600 --> 04:07:03,360
Yeah, I didn't think it would come to this got no choice to put out all the stops

1752
04:07:07,040 --> 04:07:09,040
What the why are you looking me like that?

1753
04:07:20,400 --> 04:07:24,080
Bowser's minions are too strong I might be doomed to obscurity after all

1754
04:07:24,480 --> 04:07:30,480
Very least let me level up your chain chomp Bowser that way I can remember can be remembered for something

1755
04:07:32,800 --> 04:07:36,800
This is the rascally chain chomp, huh? All right, let's level this puppy up

1756
04:07:38,960 --> 04:07:41,760
It's gold now all done

1757
04:07:43,680 --> 04:07:48,240
That was way easier than everything else and chomp becomes wonder chomp

1758
04:07:48,800 --> 04:07:50,800
Oh

1759
04:07:52,720 --> 04:07:55,680
Cute what do you think of my new pal?

1760
04:07:56,720 --> 04:08:00,720
It suits you the pair of you making it the two of you make an intimidating pair

1761
04:08:02,080 --> 04:08:08,000
More haha who dared to mess with the great Bowser in his most powerful chain chomp. No one that's who

1762
04:08:09,360 --> 04:08:11,760
Hey, butchinello, you're good at this stuff

1763
04:08:12,480 --> 04:08:16,560
I'll do you a special favor and let you put those skills to fixing

1764
04:08:17,280 --> 04:08:19,280
To use fixing up my keep

1765
04:08:20,160 --> 04:08:21,040
Oh gosh

1766
04:08:21,040 --> 04:08:23,760
Yippee with the famous bow wrap sir asking me for my help

1767
04:08:23,760 --> 04:08:25,760
Maybe a little thing will rub off on me

1768
04:08:25,760 --> 04:08:29,440
My dream has finally come true and now I can show my face around home with pride

1769
04:08:30,080 --> 04:08:34,880
We know when repairs when repairs on the keep start now kiom running

1770
04:08:37,200 --> 04:08:39,920
Guy sure gets excited easy what's so great about being famous

1771
04:08:41,600 --> 04:08:46,480
Who knows who knows but he's giving up on making bombs and that's good enough for me

1772
04:08:47,120 --> 04:08:49,120
I

1773
04:08:53,360 --> 04:08:55,360
Let me get out of here

1774
04:08:57,760 --> 04:09:00,800
I don't want to do this again. I'm gonna go the other way

1775
04:09:09,280 --> 04:09:14,240
Why is this one so damn high I haven't figured out how to do this one yet

1776
04:09:16,880 --> 04:09:19,920
Oh, I did it

1777
04:09:32,240 --> 04:09:35,120
It took me forever, but I did it. Fuck it. Maybe we'll do it this way

1778
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:44,800
I don't want to play this one again this one was kind of annoying

1779
04:09:46,640 --> 04:09:48,640

1780
04:09:50,320 --> 04:09:52,320

04:11:01,360 --> 04:11:03,360
Okay, this is better

1788
04:11:07,840 --> 04:11:09,840

1796
04:12:58,720 --> 04:13:03,680
Fuck it. Let's just finish it the smell of money

1797
04:13:08,640 --> 04:13:10,640
The smell of money was too strong

1798
04:13:10,880 --> 04:13:12,880

1799
04:13:14,400 --> 04:13:16,400

1800
04:13:17,040 --> 04:13:19,040
Okay

1801
04:13:43,200 --> 04:13:45,200
New record, yay

1802
04:13:47,120 --> 04:13:51,120
But take care of the trolley so don't worry about it. Yeah, I didn't think so

1803
04:13:56,800 --> 04:14:03,920
Ugh I beat my own time not like it was hard. I just took everything so slowly

1804
04:14:17,120 --> 04:14:19,120
Oh

1805
04:14:23,360 --> 04:14:25,360

Not yet

1809
04:14:51,280 --> 04:14:57,840
I think booster is looking for some company again Mario booster now that's a guy that's fun

1810
04:14:59,680 --> 04:15:04,080
Probably won't be as fun the second time around my god Bellum was so hard

1811
04:15:04,400 --> 04:15:06,400
Oh

1812
04:15:10,800 --> 04:15:14,240
Boy this fight don't tell me it's it's hard as shit, right?

1813
04:15:14,240 --> 04:15:16,240
Okay

04:15:31,920 --> 04:15:33,920
It's a what race

1815
04:15:36,720 --> 04:15:38,720
It's a what race

1816
04:15:44,640 --> 04:15:53,520
I gotta save point don't I?

1817
04:16:03,600 --> 04:16:07,600
Where were these numbers when I was fighting bosses, huh? Oh

1818
04:16:14,240 --> 04:16:17,200
Yeah, where were these numbers, huh?

1819
04:16:44,240 --> 04:16:46,240
I

1820
04:17:03,600 --> 04:17:05,600
Still got the eyes

1821
04:17:08,640 --> 04:17:11,680
And my eyes are on the prize but also in misery

1822
04:17:14,240 --> 04:17:16,240
I

1823
04:17:23,280 --> 04:17:25,280
Play now

1824
04:17:25,280 --> 04:17:29,520
Um, it's not so bad being stuck in the room. It's not like I get lonely or anything like that

1825
04:17:30,480 --> 04:17:32,480
Oh, he gets lonely

1826
04:17:44,240 --> 04:17:46,240
Oh

1827
04:17:59,120 --> 04:18:04,240
Nice guy the juggling guy I felt it too

1828
04:18:14,960 --> 04:18:16,960
Oops

1829
04:18:23,040 --> 04:18:25,040
I wonder how mallows attack is now

1830
04:18:44,480 --> 04:18:50,480
Why not use multiple save slots in case the main one gets corrupted how's it gonna get corrupted?

1831
04:18:52,480 --> 04:18:54,480
This isn't ps2

1832
04:18:57,440 --> 04:18:59,440
As far as I know

1833
04:19:14,800 --> 04:19:16,800
I

1834
04:19:19,360 --> 04:19:24,480
Oh, I found a frog coin I didn't realize no e-wares

1835
04:19:44,240 --> 04:19:46,240
I

1836
04:19:46,240 --> 04:19:48,240
I

1837
04:20:03,680 --> 04:20:05,680
Yeah

1838
04:20:08,880 --> 04:20:13,760
I didn't feel for a chain chop to attack its own kind. I wonder if it feels any betrayal

1839
04:20:14,720 --> 04:20:16,720
You ever think about that senpai

1840
04:20:35,520 --> 04:20:37,520
You know, it's just a thought I'm just like wow

1841
04:20:38,160 --> 04:20:43,040
I wonder if this chain shop feels anything because like you technically kill them right?

1842
04:20:44,080 --> 04:20:46,080
Oh

1843
04:20:55,520 --> 04:20:57,520
This is always so cute

1844
04:21:03,360 --> 04:21:05,360
The chain chomp violence

1845
04:21:13,760 --> 04:21:24,080
Oh special enemies are very weak now nice at least this time

1846
04:21:44,480 --> 04:21:49,600
Okay, let's see where's the wife and kids

1847
04:21:52,960 --> 04:21:58,480
Wow, wow, it's people did you notice a new addition to my personal railway this one's engine

1848
04:22:00,240 --> 04:22:02,240
To zero to three

1849
04:22:03,040 --> 04:22:05,040
What you can make that yourself

1850
04:22:07,840 --> 04:22:09,840
Hey

1851
04:22:09,840 --> 04:22:14,320
What's the skill touch to bill skill touch to build and maintain that all in your own

1852
04:22:15,280 --> 04:22:17,280
With all saying words

1853
04:22:17,280 --> 04:22:19,280
You know you got there brink lady

1854
04:22:20,480 --> 04:22:24,720
This body isn't actually I won't bother getting into it. It's too complicated

1855
04:22:26,240 --> 04:22:29,840
Booster do you not remember everything that happened the last time you saw us?

1856
04:22:31,360 --> 04:22:35,760
Sure lots of people showed up at my house and then there was a big fuss for some reason now

1857
04:22:35,760 --> 04:22:42,000
It's my turn to ask a question. Are you gonna stick around and play with me and my engine 23?

1858
04:22:42,400 --> 04:22:44,400
That'll be great fun. Yeah, you bet

1859
04:22:45,920 --> 04:22:48,240
Yay, then this train is leaving the station

1860
04:22:58,720 --> 04:23:00,720
Oh, wait, I'm gonna start working

1861
04:23:01,600 --> 04:23:03,600
Booster seems to be up to something

1862
04:23:03,920 --> 04:23:08,640
You can split wait. I thought you said this is like a just train thing

1863
04:23:13,840 --> 04:23:16,800
We're here to support boosters so you can make progress on this maintenance

1864
04:23:17,920 --> 04:23:19,920
Oh

1865
04:23:22,960 --> 04:23:25,920
Right we delay engine zero 23 is now departing

1866
04:23:33,600 --> 04:23:35,600
So

1867
04:23:51,280 --> 04:23:54,320
What the hell the 99 damage

1868
04:24:03,600 --> 04:24:05,600
So

1869
04:24:27,760 --> 04:24:30,260
Even lazy shell couldn't tank that

1870
04:24:34,320 --> 04:24:36,320
So

1871
04:24:44,560 --> 04:24:46,560
Okay, you still don't do much

1872
04:24:49,680 --> 04:24:51,680
Start working

1873
04:25:03,600 --> 04:25:18,160
You broke boosters concentration, okay understood I understand the mechanics now

1874
04:25:33,920 --> 04:25:35,920
I

1875
04:25:46,880 --> 04:25:48,880
Am fucked

1876
04:25:50,960 --> 04:25:54,160
I'm fucked. I'm so fucked. I'm so fucked

1877
04:26:03,600 --> 04:26:06,560

Do

1879
04:26:54,800 --> 04:26:57,040
How much do I need to break his concentration?

1880
04:27:00,480 --> 04:27:02,480
Just a little bit

1881
04:27:03,600 --> 04:27:05,600
So

1882
04:27:34,400 --> 04:27:36,400
I

1883
04:27:40,640 --> 04:27:42,640
Checking hard

1884
04:27:52,960 --> 04:27:57,280
Where's the one that yeah, let's do the Coca-Cola

1885
04:28:03,920 --> 04:28:05,920
Oh

1886
04:28:09,120 --> 04:28:11,120
Come on

1887
04:28:18,160 --> 04:28:21,120
I didn't even get to hit him did I

1888
04:28:29,920 --> 04:28:31,920
Did I even get to hit him

1889
04:28:31,920 --> 04:28:34,720
He just he just did it

1890
04:29:01,920 --> 04:29:12,320
Okay, well, I guess we'll see they seem to have a lot of HP though

1891
04:29:31,920 --> 04:29:33,920
So

1892
04:29:53,040 --> 04:29:55,040
Wait, can I

1893
04:29:56,400 --> 04:29:58,080
Use this

1894
04:29:58,080 --> 04:30:01,040
Can I use this against that fucking train?

1895
04:30:01,920 --> 04:30:03,920
Yeah

1896
04:30:20,480 --> 04:30:22,480
God damn it

1897
04:30:31,920 --> 04:30:33,920

So

1900
04:31:11,920 --> 04:31:14,720
If I don't kill him he just gets it

1901
04:31:31,920 --> 04:31:33,920
So

1902
04:31:45,120 --> 04:31:47,120

So

Sorry for being so quiet I'm actually like super frustrated

1935
04:43:40,080 --> 04:43:43,760
When I'm like super frustrated I just get real quiet

1936
04:43:46,560 --> 04:43:48,560
Oh

1937
04:43:57,040 --> 04:43:59,040

04:43:59,040 --> 04:44:18,000
Are you serious right now? Oh shit. Are you serious?

1939
04:44:29,040 --> 04:44:31,040
Oh

1940
04:44:44,400 --> 04:44:46,400
One more time

1941
04:44:52,640 --> 04:44:55,600
I'm not gonna lie to you that was really brutal

1942
04:44:59,120 --> 04:45:04,560
But I don't know if I want to do it again. I'm at that I'm at that point some pie

1943
04:45:06,480 --> 04:45:09,200
I'm at that point some pie where I'm just like oh

1944
04:45:10,160 --> 04:45:14,000
I already went like what do you call it? I already went nonverbal

1945
04:45:18,960 --> 04:45:20,960
I already went nonverbal

1946
04:45:29,520 --> 04:45:33,760
Okay, oh god

1947
04:45:38,080 --> 04:45:40,080
I was so

1948
04:45:40,800 --> 04:45:48,160
I was so close though. You saw that you saw this fight was bullshit. This fight was bullshit, right?

1949
04:45:49,360 --> 04:45:51,680
I'm not the only one everyone thinks so

1950
04:45:52,080 --> 04:45:54,080
Oh

1951
04:45:56,880 --> 04:45:59,840
Everyone saw it and so I'm right

1952
04:46:00,800 --> 04:46:02,800
Oh

1953
04:46:18,640 --> 04:46:22,400
They cheated that's right they cheated not me they did

1954
04:46:23,360 --> 04:46:25,360
I

1955
04:46:26,880 --> 04:46:32,320
Was like my super baby like no it was it was them all along

1956
04:46:39,280 --> 04:46:42,080
From what I've heard booster is the hardest of the pulse game

1957
04:46:46,640 --> 04:46:51,040
If I can't imagine how hard this would have been

1958
04:46:53,040 --> 04:46:54,640
in

1959
04:46:54,640 --> 04:46:56,640
the original

1960
04:46:56,640 --> 04:47:00,080
Because I don't think in the original you can switch people out, right?

1961
04:47:06,400 --> 04:47:10,400
Or these are new it didn't exist fuck

1962
04:47:22,720 --> 04:47:24,720
Oh

1963
04:47:27,120 --> 04:47:29,680
There was no post game in the original, huh?

1964
04:47:32,000 --> 04:47:34,800
No post game that was it. It's over. Fuck you

1965
04:47:38,480 --> 04:47:41,840
Damn they actually made this fight hard hard, you know

1966
04:47:44,400 --> 04:47:49,520
I don't even know if I can do like the whole boss rush again. This is awful

1967
04:47:50,400 --> 04:47:53,040
This is awful. I'm miserable

1968
04:47:54,080 --> 04:47:57,120
And every time I take a long time to beat someone it's like

1969
04:48:14,320 --> 04:48:17,200
I don't think I can do it. I'm sorry supplies

1970
04:48:20,480 --> 04:48:22,480
I'm sorry some pies

1971
04:48:28,240 --> 04:48:38,640
But I am not skilled enough to finish this I don't think I don't think I'm skilled enough to finish this

1972
04:48:43,280 --> 04:48:47,840
Not not yet at least I haven't reached the gamer levels yet

1973
04:48:49,520 --> 04:48:51,520
So

1974
04:49:11,040 --> 04:49:13,040
Give me a second. Let me just

1975
04:49:13,600 --> 04:49:15,600
Do

1976
04:49:19,840 --> 04:49:21,840
The switch to sleep

1977
04:49:27,280 --> 04:49:35,200
That's bullshit absolute bullshit blah blah blah. I hate it. I'm so mad. I'm throwing my mustache away

1978
04:49:43,040 --> 04:49:45,040
I

1979
04:49:51,440 --> 04:49:58,640
Thank you for the 690 we finished the game any powers call. I don't apologize. I'm I'm just apologizing because

1980
04:49:59,200 --> 04:50:01,200
It would have been cool

1981
04:50:01,600 --> 04:50:03,840
It would have been cool to end on a win

1982
04:50:04,160 --> 04:50:15,920
It would have been cool to end on a win, but I didn't

1983
04:50:21,280 --> 04:50:25,600
Mercy modi's waiting you come from oh, you know, I just been around

1984
04:50:25,680 --> 04:50:27,680
Ha ha ha ha

1985
04:50:29,680 --> 04:50:34,000
Raiden mercy, oh go. Oh my gosh, mercy. Oh might with the mustache

1986
04:50:41,840 --> 04:50:44,320
Mercy, I won't be back yet

1987
04:50:44,320 --> 04:50:46,320
Ha ha ha ha

1988
04:50:54,400 --> 04:51:01,440
Mercy wow you are gone. We got new emotes. Oh fantastic. I love my emotes. I hope you all like them

1989
04:51:01,680 --> 04:51:03,680
Oh

1990
04:51:13,200 --> 04:51:15,200
Anyways

1991
04:51:17,280 --> 04:51:23,200
Anyways, um, what was I gonna say? Uh already for gore

1992
04:51:31,760 --> 04:51:33,760
I

1993
04:51:34,320 --> 04:51:40,560
Think I think some of the emotes are a little harder to to see when it's so tiny

1994
04:51:41,760 --> 04:51:46,560
Uh, but otherwise I think I think I think overall it looks pretty good

1995
04:51:52,560 --> 04:51:55,280
They're so much smaller than twitches, uh

1996
04:51:55,920 --> 04:52:01,760
There's so much smaller than twitches, um emotes

1997
04:52:07,360 --> 04:52:09,360
They're pretty small, but I hope

1998
04:52:11,520 --> 04:52:16,480
Even if you even you can kind of like see some details

1999
04:52:18,160 --> 04:52:24,880
Some details and be like, oh, I kind of see them. I kind of see them. There's there's a sippy cup one

2000
04:52:26,080 --> 04:52:28,080
Oh

2001
04:52:30,960 --> 04:52:33,440
And then the drinking tired one

2002
04:52:35,040 --> 04:52:37,040
I just started zooming in my browser

2003
04:52:38,160 --> 04:52:45,760
I feel the I feel a little sad that some of them don't read that well, but

2004
04:52:48,160 --> 04:52:50,320
That's we can blame youtube for that

2005
04:52:51,280 --> 04:52:55,840
We can blame youtube for that hardcore

2006
04:53:01,600 --> 04:53:04,240
Like the sensei one didn't come out

2007
04:53:06,320 --> 04:53:11,680
As well as I expected it, but I hope I hope it's still kind of like

2008
04:53:12,560 --> 04:53:14,560
You know, uh-huh, uh-huh

2009
04:53:15,040 --> 04:53:22,800
You can use it. I figured the sensei one you can use for both notes and being like, oh, I see and then explaining things

2010
04:53:27,840 --> 04:53:34,160
Like taking notes and stuff you can also use it when you learn something something new

2011
04:53:34,560 --> 04:53:36,560
So

2012
04:53:42,240 --> 04:53:44,240
I think it's very versatile

2013
04:53:46,560 --> 04:53:52,800
It's actually but like kind of it's actually but like I don't know cuter

2014
04:53:56,880 --> 04:53:58,880
Cuter and I feel like you know

2015
04:53:59,280 --> 04:54:05,280
Actually makes you want to just not learn and then this one's just like, you know, like you're in a class

2016
04:54:09,840 --> 04:54:11,840
I think that one that one's pretty good

2017
04:54:14,480 --> 04:54:17,200
Otherwise I think, um

2018
04:54:20,240 --> 04:54:22,240
Yeah, I think that's pretty

2019
04:54:22,400 --> 04:54:28,960
That's pretty good. I think most of the emotes are very versatile in emotions

2020
04:54:31,520 --> 04:54:36,000
So we can we can have fun with them. Yeah, I chose them out specifically

2021
04:54:36,000 --> 04:54:40,320
I have a lot of cry and two drinking emotes because I feel like the two drinking emotes

2022
04:54:41,120 --> 04:54:43,120
uh

2023
04:54:44,640 --> 04:54:46,640
Kind of show

2024
04:54:47,440 --> 04:54:56,480
Kind of show two different drinking feelings like one's like sipping peacefully, you know, maybe like

2025
04:55:01,440 --> 04:55:04,800
And then the other ones like I'm so stressed right now

2026
04:55:07,760 --> 04:55:09,760
I'm so tired and stressed

2027
04:55:10,480 --> 04:55:16,400
And and since

2028
04:55:21,680 --> 04:55:23,680
Like regular sippy and hardcore

2029
04:55:29,360 --> 04:55:34,160
That's pretty good, I feel like I I chose two drinking ones because

2030
04:55:35,200 --> 04:55:38,160
Uh, I feel like senpai's hear me sip a lot

2031
04:55:40,240 --> 04:55:42,240
I

2032
04:55:47,680 --> 04:55:49,680
So I

2033
04:55:49,680 --> 04:55:51,040
I hope that

2034
04:55:51,040 --> 04:55:52,240
You know

2035
04:55:52,240 --> 04:55:54,560
When you all hear hear me like drink

2036
04:55:56,240 --> 04:56:00,480
It's two different types of drinks. Usually it was like casual hi, kate

2037
04:56:01,200 --> 04:56:04,800
You and the other ones like let's get this fucking going

2038
04:56:10,320 --> 04:56:12,320
Oh

2039
04:56:17,840 --> 04:56:25,120
Well, yeah, I have a lot of tears as well because I'm just a cry baby, but each tear represents something else

2040
04:56:30,240 --> 04:56:34,320
It's just one is laughing crying kind of like that

2041
04:56:34,560 --> 04:56:36,560
Oh

2042
04:56:38,080 --> 04:56:40,080
You know though

2043
04:56:41,040 --> 04:56:43,040
Tears

2044
04:56:43,760 --> 04:56:45,760
And then there's laughing crying

2045
04:56:52,640 --> 04:56:58,720
The pouty teary up laughing crying like you're you're laughing so hard your side hurts

2046
04:56:59,680 --> 04:57:08,480
And then and then the concentration I can't redo that face unless I'm really concentrating but

2047
04:57:15,680 --> 04:57:17,680
It's like that

2048
04:57:20,240 --> 04:57:22,240
Walked in face

2049
04:57:29,520 --> 04:57:31,760
All right, I think I can recreate it just a bit

2050
04:57:38,080 --> 04:57:40,080
There it is

2051
04:57:48,320 --> 04:57:50,320
Like that

2052
04:57:50,480 --> 04:58:02,640
It's a bit angry it's cuz when you concentrate you look angry all the time when you're focused you look angry all the time

2053
04:58:04,560 --> 04:58:06,560
It's like

2054
04:58:06,560 --> 04:58:08,560
You know stank face

2055
04:58:08,560 --> 04:58:13,760
Stank face when people like are like super concentrated or like they're really grooving to music

2056
04:58:17,040 --> 04:58:19,040
Yeah, they're like

2057
04:58:20,480 --> 04:58:24,480
Well, they're like having a good time, right?

2058
04:58:28,720 --> 04:58:36,000
Me on the other hand, I wasn't having a good time with booster. I love booster, but man that fight was oh shit

2059
04:58:36,960 --> 04:58:38,960
Absolutely garbage

2060
04:58:43,840 --> 04:58:45,840
Do that again we were like

2061
04:58:51,120 --> 04:58:53,120
I

2062
04:59:03,120 --> 04:59:05,120
Why you gonna take a screenshot of it

2063
04:59:16,400 --> 04:59:18,400
I don't really know what this one is

2064
04:59:19,120 --> 04:59:23,440
The horrified face are you are you're horrified you're like

2065
04:59:38,640 --> 04:59:40,640
I usually people

2066
04:59:40,640 --> 04:59:42,640
I

2067
04:59:46,800 --> 04:59:49,920
Actually referenced that card capture soccer a moment

2068
04:59:53,360 --> 04:59:58,160
It's kind of like when you're in fear and you hate everything in life. Yeah

2069
05:00:04,400 --> 05:00:06,400
Yeah, anyways

2070
05:00:06,720 --> 05:00:11,040
It all comes back to kind capture soccer always does

2071
05:00:14,640 --> 05:00:17,200
Anyways, this is how I feel after the booster fight

2072
05:00:33,840 --> 05:00:35,840
After that booster fight and

2073
05:00:36,560 --> 05:00:40,960
The balloon fight this was how I felt the entire time

2074
05:00:49,040 --> 05:00:54,720
Like goodbye ganky girl energy it's gone. She's dead. I don't even know her anymore

2075
05:01:00,560 --> 05:01:04,400
He had way too much hp though, so yeah

2076
05:01:07,200 --> 05:01:12,320
Okay, let's check what my schedule was. Ah, I wanted to end on a win

2077
05:01:12,880 --> 05:01:17,200
But we didn't so that sucked, but we beat the game anyway, so

2078
05:01:18,320 --> 05:01:20,320
Whatever

2079
05:01:26,800 --> 05:01:31,200
Tomorrow is the asmr train

2080
05:01:31,760 --> 05:01:33,760

In a few hours you will all get to enjoy six hours of non stop a s m r

2083
05:01:56,000 --> 05:02:02,640
I know train mentioned miserable, isn't it?

2084
05:02:09,520 --> 05:02:13,200

05:05:48,880 --> 05:05:51,040
It's funny that we we keep on getting

We keep on getting like a bunch of a's right

2115

We can fit a until a lot of this

2116
05:06:03,360 --> 05:06:07,040
Okay, yeah, but then we have the friday asmr, which is tomorrow

2117
05:06:08,240 --> 05:06:12,560
So I'll set that up. Please note that this asmr

2118
05:06:12,800 --> 05:06:14,800

2121
05:06:43,120 --> 05:06:48,960
It's tomorrow starting in a few hours. So then you will catch

2122
05:06:50,640 --> 05:06:55,680
Catch I see I would highly recommend leaving all of us on

2123
05:06:56,320 --> 05:07:02,800
For the nice little view for the nice view for the nice for the nice. What do you call it? Uh

2124
05:07:06,400 --> 05:07:08,880
You know the algal the algorithm

2125
05:07:13,120 --> 05:07:20,000
The algorithm if you get the algorithm then the algorithm can be like the plus one view and then you know, it's better

2126
05:07:20,560 --> 05:07:22,560
So we're gonna see

2127
05:07:23,200 --> 05:07:29,680
Uh, so yeah, I love all my girls. So starting off with our probably strongest asmr is

2128
05:07:31,280 --> 05:07:35,920
Is I see who's who's who's very very very well versed in asmr

2129
05:07:37,200 --> 05:07:39,200
Love her to bits

2130
05:07:40,160 --> 05:07:47,280
Uh, she's she is she is probably I don't want to say like the best asmr miss asmr

2131
05:07:50,480 --> 05:08:00,000
But the most experience the most seasoned a veteran asmr is if you will

2132
05:08:00,000 --> 05:08:02,000
And

2133
05:08:04,960 --> 05:08:13,440
So I guess we're starting off with the first three's kind of like most familiar and then ending with the uh

2134
05:08:17,920 --> 05:08:19,920
With the um

2135
05:08:21,200 --> 05:08:24,560
A little bit like the the the three sort of newbies

2136
05:08:24,560 --> 05:08:31,680
Well, are you streaming for two hours or one hours? I'm gonna try

2137
05:08:34,400 --> 05:08:36,400
To do

2138
05:08:36,720 --> 05:08:38,720
Two hours

2139
05:08:38,720 --> 05:08:40,720
But since I'm ending it

2140
05:08:41,120 --> 05:08:43,920
Maybe it'll give me a little bit of leeway

2141
05:08:45,360 --> 05:08:47,600
leeway to end a little earlier

2142
05:08:51,120 --> 05:08:53,120
Mostly because

2143
05:08:54,640 --> 05:09:01,280
Asmr is hard for me. I I start I start repeating that the the triggers and stuff. I don't even know

2144
05:09:02,000 --> 05:09:04,000
You know

2145
05:09:06,080 --> 05:09:09,760
I'm confused since she said six hours, but everyone's doing two hours. It would be 12

2146
05:09:11,840 --> 05:09:13,840
How long is everyone planning this for?

2147
05:09:24,560 --> 05:09:26,560
So

2148
05:09:43,840 --> 05:09:46,880
Now I think it's only two hours. Oh wait, I forgot

2149
05:09:48,800 --> 05:09:50,640
Oh

2150
05:09:50,640 --> 05:09:54,640
I forgot I forgot. I think I think I see is not gonna start it

2151
05:10:01,680 --> 05:10:06,240
I think I don't think I see is gonna start it. I think I see is taking the a break right now

2152
05:10:11,600 --> 05:10:16,480
I for I forgot I forgot so I would start with scrawny instead later in the day

2153
05:10:20,880 --> 05:10:22,880
Oh

2154
05:10:28,800 --> 05:10:35,360
That's a shame that's a shame I feel sad. Oh well, I will oh well

2155
05:10:36,960 --> 05:10:41,600
It I see I see deserves all the rest she can get in the world

2156
05:10:43,440 --> 05:10:49,840
So it's okay. It's okay. She'll probably make up for it. Uh, especially to the snowberries

2157
05:10:50,720 --> 05:10:53,360
Or the dad does she'll probably make up for it. So don't worry about it

2158
05:10:58,240 --> 05:11:03,760
So so she she's a hard worker. She really is a hard worker. So, uh

2159
05:11:05,680 --> 05:11:10,720
Though definitely probably be another one in the future, but but yeah, I'm mistaken. I'm so sorry

2160
05:11:11,360 --> 05:11:17,280
I'm so sorry. That would mean that scrawny will start it will start the um ASMR actually is

2161
05:11:18,160 --> 05:11:22,000
Looking at the list now a scrawny shibby emmy and then asra and then me

2162
05:11:24,560 --> 05:11:27,840
Yeah, we'll channel her energy for our finale

2163
05:11:35,920 --> 05:11:41,120
So, yeah wish her all the best all the best I'm sure even

2164
05:11:42,160 --> 05:11:44,560
She'll be happy even if the senpai's

2165
05:11:44,960 --> 05:11:51,280
Uh wished her wished her luck as well and wished her, uh, good rest

2166
05:11:54,960 --> 05:11:56,960
That means no shortening it kohai

2167
05:12:01,840 --> 05:12:03,920
I'll try my best then I'm just

2168
05:12:04,800 --> 05:12:06,800
I'm pretty new to ASMR's

2169
05:12:07,200 --> 05:12:08,720
so

2170
05:12:08,800 --> 05:12:17,520
It's gonna be it's gonna be an experience trying to figure out what people like and what people don't like so I'll be testing

2171
05:12:22,960 --> 05:12:26,160
I'll be testing a few triggers that I found

2172
05:12:28,400 --> 05:12:31,840
And I was like, I think this makes a nice sound probably

2173
05:12:32,240 --> 05:12:34,240
I

2174
05:12:34,960 --> 05:12:40,560
Apologize, but it might also be very quiet. So I'll try my best to to

2175
05:12:42,320 --> 05:12:47,520
Bring up the gain, but there's but I will ask everyone to maybe like

2176
05:12:49,040 --> 05:12:54,080
Be very of maybe some soundish some volume issues. Once again, I'm still a newbie

2177
05:12:58,720 --> 05:13:00,720
And then

2178
05:13:01,840 --> 05:13:06,640
And then yeah, so tomorrow will be mostly me

2179
05:13:07,440 --> 05:13:10,000
bearing you all with triggers

2180
05:13:10,560 --> 05:13:12,320
um

2181
05:13:12,320 --> 05:13:14,320
Hopefully one of them sticks

2182
05:13:17,440 --> 05:13:19,760
I'm sure one of them will stick

2183
05:13:22,160 --> 05:13:24,160
I'm still very new

2184
05:13:26,240 --> 05:13:28,240
And then

2185
05:13:28,800 --> 05:13:34,960
The day after since since, uh, the this was the asmr

2186
05:13:35,680 --> 05:13:37,680
martrain, uh

2187
05:13:38,080 --> 05:13:41,120
The day after the saturday is my

2188
05:13:45,040 --> 05:13:49,200
Catgirl ASMR for members only

2189
05:13:51,520 --> 05:13:55,920
You must be snippetier or above to go to that

2190
05:13:56,160 --> 05:13:58,160
to the

2191
05:13:59,840 --> 05:14:01,840
To listen in on that

2192
05:14:09,280 --> 05:14:13,040
So it will be shatter day. Yeah such

2193
05:14:15,360 --> 05:14:17,760
So I'll I will try my best

2194
05:14:19,520 --> 05:14:23,360
I will try my best to give you all a good

2195
05:14:24,000 --> 05:14:26,560
scenario real-play scenario

2196
05:14:34,080 --> 05:14:37,520
Hopefully it works out, uh, I'll

2197
05:14:39,760 --> 05:14:42,400
Really try my best. I'll try my best

2198
05:14:44,240 --> 05:14:46,880
To be a good good cat girl

2199
05:14:47,840 --> 05:14:57,200
So yeah, those are for my members only I think it will be very special

2200
05:15:01,680 --> 05:15:07,120
I think it'll be very special since it's gonna be my first time trying something like that

2201
05:15:07,360 --> 05:15:09,360
I

2202
05:15:12,320 --> 05:15:18,720
Don't think I ever did like a cat cat thing even in my acting days

2203
05:15:20,160 --> 05:15:23,040
I'm thinking about like I don't think I ever got a role

2204
05:15:23,760 --> 05:15:28,800
Where it was like had to be like cat like or anything. I remember I had to be a snake once

2205
05:15:29,920 --> 05:15:31,920
But I don't think I ever did like

2206
05:15:38,000 --> 05:15:40,000
I

2207
05:15:43,040 --> 05:15:49,440
About nyan taro nyan taro is not making an appearance here and do cast some Broadway. No

2208
05:15:54,560 --> 05:16:01,760
We need to hear some snake mercy. It'll be something like this

2209
05:16:08,080 --> 05:16:10,560
That might be a good idea for like a uh

2210
05:16:13,280 --> 05:16:15,280
A uh

2211
05:16:23,600 --> 05:16:26,400
I think that was the voice I did I think that was really

2212
05:16:28,960 --> 05:16:30,960
That was the voice I did when I was a snake

2213
05:16:38,000 --> 05:16:40,960
I think that was the voice I did when I was a snake

2214
05:16:45,600 --> 05:16:55,200
Nyan taro is not gonna be making an appearance, okay nyan taro knows that it's my time to be the cat

2215
05:17:07,280 --> 05:17:12,080
But but nyan taro-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba what about mercy, huh?

2216
05:17:14,800 --> 05:17:16,800
What about me? What about my needs?

2217
05:17:23,280 --> 05:17:25,280
What my needs, huh?

2218
05:17:31,280 --> 05:17:35,360
What about our special date time, huh for every membership, huh?

2219
05:17:37,120 --> 05:17:59,540
Remember, every member is a date night in my special time with you.

2220
05:17:59,540 --> 05:18:02,960
Only the real supplies are in there.

2221
05:18:02,960 --> 05:18:32,800
Or at least, or at least the 1-2 who want the membership are there.

2222
05:18:33,360 --> 05:18:52,320
There are other real supplies outside of that, but it's the ones that want the bonus content.

2223
05:18:52,320 --> 05:19:05,440
I know some people are just not into membership stuff, so that's valid too.

2224
05:19:05,440 --> 05:19:12,720
Because it is like behind a paywall, I consider it a pretty special date, you know?

2225
05:19:12,720 --> 05:19:17,680
So I try my best to keep them extra special.

2226
05:19:22,640 --> 05:19:25,520
But every time with all my supplies is very special.

2227
05:19:34,880 --> 05:19:36,720
I try to make them extra special.

2228
05:19:37,680 --> 05:19:44,080
Because I feel like, you know, you've worked very hard, and I was very kind.

2229
05:19:48,960 --> 05:19:54,480
And very kind to be supporting, so that's the bonus stuff.

2230
05:19:58,720 --> 05:20:02,160
It's mostly me yapping, let's be real, it's mostly me yapping, but...

2231
05:20:02,880 --> 05:20:08,880
I think there's like more topics to yapp about.

2232
05:20:16,160 --> 05:20:18,880
I don't know, I feel like it's very intimate.

2233
05:20:32,160 --> 05:20:51,040
But yeah, I will probably do a public packer ASMR.

2234
05:20:55,040 --> 05:20:59,040
It probably won't be the same.

2235
05:21:02,880 --> 05:21:12,320
It probably won't be the same experience or scenario, but probably be something else.

2236
05:21:15,040 --> 05:21:23,040
Just so the, yeah, just a different tone, and a different theme, or a different type of cat.

2237
05:21:23,040 --> 05:21:32,880
So it's not going to be a one-to-one, since I think, I think memberships are extra special,

2238
05:21:32,880 --> 05:21:42,560
so I want to make them, I want to make them like different, you know, a bit different.

2239
05:21:42,960 --> 05:21:55,440
He's a fairy in disguise, I think I made a fursona a long time ago.

2240
05:21:59,360 --> 05:22:01,280
I think, I think it's a great,

2241
05:22:05,280 --> 05:22:06,240
I think it's great.

2242
05:22:12,560 --> 05:22:15,680
It's like, you know, your pony sonar or something, you just make those shit.

2243
05:22:20,080 --> 05:22:24,640
It's a, it's a great way to like, do character creation.

2244
05:22:27,760 --> 05:22:28,640
It's just fun.

2245
05:22:30,400 --> 05:22:38,640
I won't lie to you though, I do not have like, a fursuit or anything.

2246
05:22:43,040 --> 05:22:45,040
What's my fursona's name?

2247
05:22:46,880 --> 05:22:47,600
It was Honey.

2248
05:22:56,560 --> 05:22:57,600
Like, I don't have,

2249
05:23:01,440 --> 05:23:05,920
I don't have like, do I have a special tail though? No, no, I have nothing.

2250
05:23:06,800 --> 05:23:09,200
It was literally just, just like a drawing.

2251
05:23:13,040 --> 05:23:15,040
It was just a drawing and I was like, oh, it's cute.

2252
05:23:17,840 --> 05:23:19,760
It's cute and I was happy with it.

2253
05:23:24,400 --> 05:23:27,120
I was cute, I was happy with it.

2254
05:23:27,120 --> 05:23:33,840
I'm not very much, I'm not in the, uh, what's the word?

2255
05:23:35,040 --> 05:23:38,640
Like, I don't think I would consider myself in the fairy community,

2256
05:23:39,600 --> 05:23:46,320
but I would consider myself like, appreciative of the art form.

2257
05:23:49,120 --> 05:23:50,240
I hope that makes sense.

2258
05:23:53,440 --> 05:23:56,480
Personally, I think I'm more into kimono memes.

2259
05:24:05,840 --> 05:24:06,880
Like, personally,

2260
05:24:08,640 --> 05:24:14,880
I like, uh, but I wouldn't call myself a part of the fairy community.

2261
05:24:14,880 --> 05:24:27,440
I don't feel like I participate too much past having like, this original character.

2262
05:24:31,280 --> 05:24:32,480
Past this original character.

2263
05:24:32,480 --> 05:24:38,320
I don't know, I think, I don't know, anthral, anthral, promorphic, like, characters are cute.

2264
05:24:39,520 --> 05:24:46,800
I don't know, if people are gonna judge me to be like, oh, oh, she, she, she has a fursona,

2265
05:24:46,800 --> 05:24:54,320
she's, she's a furry, then, then fucking, fucking, drop, man, man, I can't watch her anymore.

2266
05:24:54,720 --> 05:25:10,480
Then I'll just be like, eh, just taking the weed wacker.

2267
05:25:19,440 --> 05:25:23,280
I literally, it's like when I was like, oh my gosh, when I was younger.

2268
05:25:24,480 --> 05:25:36,480
I was younger, I would make like, self-insert, like, OC's for like, my favorite anime as well.

2269
05:25:44,080 --> 05:25:46,480
So I feel like it's not far off from that.

2270
05:25:47,600 --> 05:25:49,280
Oh, it's your card capture Sakura OC.

2271
05:25:49,280 --> 05:25:53,520
I didn't have one for card capture Sakura, because I just wanted to be Sakura.

2272
05:25:55,280 --> 05:25:57,280
It was an OC original character.

2273
05:26:08,160 --> 05:26:10,080
It's just an original character in my opinion.

2274
05:26:10,640 --> 05:26:13,840
I don't think I've, I don't think I've ever,

2275
05:26:17,040 --> 05:26:22,560
yeah, I don't have like a fursuit or I don't have like anything, like,

2276
05:26:25,040 --> 05:26:28,240
I don't have much art of my quote unquote fursona.

2277
05:26:28,240 --> 05:26:31,600
Actually it more, it feels more like an original character, the more I think about it.

2278
05:26:31,600 --> 05:26:35,840
I'm like, actually that's probably more like a original character that happens to be

2279
05:26:35,840 --> 05:26:37,200
furry and anthropomorphic.

2280
05:26:41,360 --> 05:26:46,000
The more I think about it, I'm like, actually, it's more like, you know,

2281
05:26:48,880 --> 05:26:52,080
it's more like an OC, but I call it a fursona.

2282
05:26:54,960 --> 05:26:59,680
What's the distinction?

2283
05:26:59,680 --> 05:27:00,560
I don't know.

2284
05:27:00,560 --> 05:27:04,560
That's why I'm like thinking about like, fursona is like your embodiment, right?

2285
05:27:05,600 --> 05:27:10,080
Like an embodiment of like a representation of you, right?

2286
05:27:10,720 --> 05:27:24,800
But then I'm just like, wait, this means that this character is more like

2287
05:27:24,800 --> 05:27:26,400
just my original character, right?

2288
05:27:29,760 --> 05:27:30,880
Yeah, oh well.

2289
05:27:30,960 --> 05:27:39,280
There's, there's a lot of layers to this.

2290
05:27:39,280 --> 05:27:43,040
Now that I think about it, it's more like maybe a,

2291
05:27:45,920 --> 05:27:49,440
maybe it's more like an original character than a fursona.

2292
05:27:49,440 --> 05:27:56,640
It's just an original character that happens to be a furry.

2293
05:28:00,960 --> 05:28:02,240
It's just a lot.

2294
05:28:02,240 --> 05:28:07,600
Okay, I'll have to talk to like, I'd have to actually talk to like

2295
05:28:08,400 --> 05:28:15,200
someone in the furry community in order to, to, to get it, get the specific nuances.

2296
05:28:20,320 --> 05:28:23,760
Because I remember there were some people that said, you know, even if it's not like a

2297
05:28:23,760 --> 05:28:29,760
character that's supposed to be them, but they also called it a fursona as well.

2298
05:28:29,760 --> 05:28:31,360
But then I'm just like thinking back and I'm like, ah.

2299
05:28:36,320 --> 05:28:36,800
I don't know.

2300
05:28:40,880 --> 05:28:41,840
There's many layers.

2301
05:28:44,160 --> 05:28:45,200
There's many layers.

2302
05:28:45,200 --> 05:28:47,920
I, there's many layers.

2303
05:28:47,920 --> 05:28:51,280
I did some research and I also made some friends in the community

2304
05:28:52,080 --> 05:28:53,440
and they were very kind.

2305
05:28:53,440 --> 05:28:54,480
They were very kind.

2306
05:28:55,520 --> 05:28:58,080
They do a lot of charity work, actually.

2307
05:28:58,960 --> 05:29:02,640
They do a lot of charity work, which is, which is why I kind of

2308
05:29:04,240 --> 05:29:06,960
got interested in it in the first place.

2309
05:29:12,080 --> 05:29:13,760
Got a Muppetsona and a Parashibi?

2310
05:29:13,760 --> 05:29:15,120
No, I don't have a Muppetsona.

2311
05:29:22,240 --> 05:29:24,800
I can't remember if I did volunteering or something.

2312
05:29:28,720 --> 05:29:37,200
But I don't have a Muppetsona yet.

2313
05:29:40,240 --> 05:29:45,440
Yet, um, yeah, I have like, I made like old sees and stuff.

2314
05:29:45,440 --> 05:29:51,120
I feel like my, I love, I love being creative, you know?

2315
05:29:51,920 --> 05:29:56,640
I love being creative.

2316
05:29:56,640 --> 05:30:01,280
So another, one way of being creative is through me is designing

2317
05:30:01,280 --> 05:30:03,840
and character world building, et cetera.

2318
05:30:06,240 --> 05:30:16,880
Honestly, if I really like doing that, like world building and stuff, lower building.

2319
05:30:16,880 --> 05:30:22,000
Like the fashion design for gen mates.

2320
05:30:22,000 --> 05:30:24,160
Yeah, I had a lot of fun with that.

2321
05:30:25,280 --> 05:30:26,480
I had a lot of fun with that.

2322
05:30:27,120 --> 05:30:30,880
Um, the girls seem to really like it too, so I'm happy.

2323
05:30:32,400 --> 05:30:33,040
I'm happy.

2324
05:30:33,040 --> 05:30:35,040
I thought they would be like, oh, it's all right.

2325
05:30:35,040 --> 05:30:38,640
But like, some of them were like, oh, I really love that.

2326
05:30:38,640 --> 05:30:40,560
I hope I get an outfit like based off of it.

2327
05:30:40,560 --> 05:30:44,160
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you have my full permission to use it.

2328
05:30:45,120 --> 05:30:46,400
If you are sure.

2329
05:30:46,400 --> 05:30:48,880
Making some sort of, you know, um,

2330
05:30:52,720 --> 05:30:57,520
making some sort of like, something inspired by it.

2331
05:30:57,520 --> 05:30:58,560
It's even fine too.

2332
05:31:02,640 --> 05:31:04,960
Maybe another stream designing some other outfits.

2333
05:31:04,960 --> 05:31:09,120
I would have to, I have to learn how to use Krita.

2334
05:31:09,680 --> 05:31:13,440
I have to relearn how to use Krita because it's been a while.

2335
05:31:15,120 --> 05:31:19,440
When I say like, I'm a pretty fashionable girl.

2336
05:31:20,080 --> 05:31:21,920
I'm a pretty fashionable girl.

2337
05:31:26,960 --> 05:31:31,200
I know way too much about fashion than I would like to admit.

2338
05:31:37,840 --> 05:31:40,960
Despite that, it's like, yeah, I know a lot about fashion.

2339
05:31:40,960 --> 05:31:43,360
What's my wardrobe t-shirt?

2340
05:31:44,560 --> 05:31:45,280
T-shirt.

2341
05:31:46,480 --> 05:31:47,200
T-shirt.

2342
05:31:49,120 --> 05:31:49,920
Oversight.

2343
05:31:49,920 --> 05:31:51,840
All of them are oversized t-shirts.

2344
05:31:54,720 --> 05:31:55,600
T-shirts.

2345
05:31:56,800 --> 05:31:57,760
Hand me downs.

2346
05:32:01,600 --> 05:32:03,440
Really ugly dresses.

2347
05:32:04,960 --> 05:32:06,320
Paisley, exactly.

2348
05:32:07,680 --> 05:32:08,720
Paisley dress.

2349
05:32:09,680 --> 05:32:10,240
Buddies.

2350
05:32:21,280 --> 05:32:26,720
I think, I think it's just because I'm like more self-conscious about myself with fashion.

2351
05:32:32,480 --> 05:32:36,400
Or maybe less self-conscious about myself and fashion.

2352
05:32:37,360 --> 05:32:42,960
When I think of them, like sometimes I go out in the really ugliest dress ever and then I don't care.

2353
05:32:59,520 --> 05:33:01,040
Like it could be just that.

2354
05:33:01,040 --> 05:33:04,640
I'm just thinking about it, but I know quite a bit about fashion.

2355
05:33:04,640 --> 05:33:08,400
I used to like dress up to the nines all the time.

2356
05:33:09,200 --> 05:33:12,800
And now I'm too tired and too much of a neat to do that.

2357
05:33:13,440 --> 05:33:15,040
Well, I guess I'm no longer a neat.

2358
05:33:24,160 --> 05:33:26,240
I guess I'm not really a neat anymore.

2359
05:33:32,240 --> 05:33:33,600
Not a neat girl failure.

2360
05:33:34,960 --> 05:33:36,160
Okay, okay.

2361
05:33:36,160 --> 05:33:37,040
Okay, okay.

2362
05:33:37,040 --> 05:33:38,480
Let's not go too far.

2363
05:33:38,480 --> 05:33:40,240
Let's not go that far yet.

2364
05:33:40,960 --> 05:33:43,760
I don't think I'm a girl failure.

2365
05:33:45,200 --> 05:33:46,720
Maybe I'm a girl loser.

2366
05:33:47,440 --> 05:33:48,960
Maybe not a girl failure.

2367
05:34:04,960 --> 05:34:10,640
Like a girl loser, not really a winner.

2368
05:34:17,040 --> 05:34:20,000
Girl you go on hikes and legs and spice social media.

2369
05:34:20,800 --> 05:34:24,160
Yeah, recently.

2370
05:34:29,040 --> 05:34:31,120
Speaking of going outside, I was swimming.

2371
05:34:31,120 --> 05:34:32,000
It was really fun.

2372
05:34:32,960 --> 05:34:39,840
My friend, the gal pal, the gal pal, by the way, is the gal pal.

2373
05:34:41,040 --> 05:34:44,400
That is super, super biased who gave me all the stuff.

2374
05:34:52,240 --> 05:34:59,520
We went out and we went to one lake.

2375
05:34:59,520 --> 05:35:02,960
Oh, the console girl, yeah.

2376
05:35:06,640 --> 05:35:12,000
We went to one lake and it was really busy.

2377
05:35:14,720 --> 05:35:16,320
But she had her dog with her.

2378
05:35:17,120 --> 05:35:18,480
She had her dog with her.

2379
05:35:18,480 --> 05:35:24,320
And I was like, we looked at the lake and we're like,

2380
05:35:25,280 --> 05:35:29,680
there's no signs saying there are no dogs allowed.

2381
05:35:29,680 --> 05:35:32,080
But we don't see any dogs at all, right?

2382
05:35:32,880 --> 05:35:36,720
So called the park management.

2383
05:35:36,720 --> 05:35:37,840
Let's just say that.

2384
05:35:37,840 --> 05:35:40,560
I think they're kind of like a park management.

2385
05:35:41,840 --> 05:35:44,480
Called them, turns out dogs not allowed.

2386
05:35:45,040 --> 05:35:47,280
Dogs can be on the grass, not in the water.

2387
05:35:47,280 --> 05:35:50,320
But it's a hot day, so we want the dog in the water, right?

2388
05:35:54,320 --> 05:35:57,360
It's a hot day.

2389
05:35:57,360 --> 05:36:00,560
The dog should be in the water playing around in the water, right?

2390
05:36:06,720 --> 05:36:13,440
So I had to drive a little bit further to a different lake.

2391
05:36:15,600 --> 05:36:16,880
Wait, is this the dog that bit you?

2392
05:36:16,880 --> 05:36:18,400
Yeah, the dog that bit me.

2393
05:36:18,400 --> 05:36:19,280
She's a good girl.

2394
05:36:20,880 --> 05:36:21,840
She's a good girl.

2395
05:36:25,280 --> 05:36:27,200
She's a good girl.

2396
05:36:27,200 --> 05:36:28,240
Just kind of dumb.

2397
05:36:31,440 --> 05:36:32,560
Grand better.

2398
05:36:32,560 --> 05:36:35,280
It still hurts a little bit, but overalls.

2399
05:36:39,120 --> 05:36:40,240
It's okay.

2400
05:36:55,040 --> 05:36:57,280
She's kind of stupid.

2401
05:36:57,280 --> 05:37:00,960
So went to a different lake.

2402
05:37:02,320 --> 05:37:03,360
Lots of dogs.

2403
05:37:04,080 --> 05:37:05,120
They're having fun.

2404
05:37:05,920 --> 05:37:08,960
I can go in the water as well with the dog.

2405
05:37:09,680 --> 05:37:10,880
He's having a blast.

2406
05:37:11,920 --> 05:37:14,000
Kids are playing with Paris at her up.

2407
05:37:14,960 --> 05:37:16,880
And you know, she's really active, right?

2408
05:37:18,880 --> 05:37:20,880
Is the dog okay after biting my hand?

2409
05:37:20,880 --> 05:37:22,160
Why wouldn't the dog be okay?

2410
05:37:22,800 --> 05:37:23,920
She just went off and play.

2411
05:37:23,920 --> 05:37:25,360
She didn't even realize she bit me.

2412
05:37:30,000 --> 05:37:33,200
And I was holding a stick up for her.

2413
05:37:40,080 --> 05:37:41,440
And I'm holding the stick.

2414
05:37:41,440 --> 05:37:44,320
You know, like how you kind of hold like a, I don't know,

2415
05:37:47,440 --> 05:37:50,720
like a light stick, like at the end, right?

2416
05:37:51,520 --> 05:37:54,800
I was holding it at the end for her to bite the stick.

2417
05:37:56,080 --> 05:37:59,360
This whole fucking area of her to bite it.

2418
05:37:59,360 --> 05:38:02,720
And then she fights my hand and I'm like,

2419
05:38:06,240 --> 05:38:07,520
I'm like, yelp.

2420
05:38:07,520 --> 05:38:09,200
And then just like pulled away.

2421
05:38:09,200 --> 05:38:09,760
That was it.

2422
05:38:09,760 --> 05:38:10,240
That was it.

2423
05:38:10,240 --> 05:38:10,960
That was nothing.

2424
05:38:13,280 --> 05:38:13,920
Yeah.

2425
05:38:13,920 --> 05:38:16,720
I have this whole area where she can go,

2426
05:38:16,720 --> 05:38:18,000
where she can just bite.

2427
05:38:18,000 --> 05:38:20,320
And then she just bit my hand instead.

2428
05:38:20,320 --> 05:38:21,760
I was like, oh my God.

2429
05:38:24,240 --> 05:38:25,280
She's sweet though.

2430
05:38:25,280 --> 05:38:26,400
She's sweet.

2431
05:38:26,400 --> 05:38:27,440
A good doggy.

2432
05:38:34,240 --> 05:38:35,440
A little dumb though.

2433
05:38:35,440 --> 05:38:39,760
I thought that was a little, little dumb of her, but she didn't even notice.

2434
05:38:39,760 --> 05:38:40,320
She just went.

2435
05:38:40,560 --> 05:38:50,720
She's a rescue dog, so I can't go too hard on her.

2436
05:38:59,040 --> 05:39:00,320
I can't go too hard on her.

2437
05:39:00,320 --> 05:39:00,960
She didn't.

2438
05:39:04,800 --> 05:39:07,920
She didn't mean any harm.

2439
05:39:08,880 --> 05:39:10,720
She was just playing, so it's fine.

2440
05:39:14,640 --> 05:39:15,680
So it's just fine.

2441
05:39:15,680 --> 05:39:18,800
I got tiny, tiny, tiny little cuts.

2442
05:39:18,800 --> 05:39:21,200
Like itty bitty, itty bitty.

2443
05:39:21,840 --> 05:39:25,920
Like I got pricked or like, and when you get a paper cut or something.

2444
05:39:29,120 --> 05:39:30,240
Teeniest, tiniest.

2445
05:39:32,080 --> 05:39:32,960
But it hurts.

2446
05:39:32,960 --> 05:39:33,920
It hurts.

2447
05:39:34,000 --> 05:39:38,640
And it didn't draw blood until I was out of the water, of course.

2448
05:39:43,920 --> 05:39:49,920
And then, and then I had like a first aid kit, so I just put band-aids on the first, around it.

2449
05:39:52,160 --> 05:39:57,200
And then I got home and then sanitized and washed my hands, etc.

2450
05:39:57,440 --> 05:40:04,080
So yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't a big deal.

2451
05:40:05,600 --> 05:40:06,560
It wasn't a big deal.

2452
05:40:09,360 --> 05:40:10,160
It wasn't a big deal.

2453
05:40:10,160 --> 05:40:15,760
Like I would be more worried if like she like chomped down, but like she just went.

2454
05:40:17,520 --> 05:40:18,960
Trying to grab the stick.

2455
05:40:19,760 --> 05:40:23,120
I was like, there's that whole area of stick.

2456
05:40:23,760 --> 05:40:25,200
Why did you bite my hand?

2457
05:40:27,200 --> 05:40:43,920
It's fine, it hurts, it hurt at the time.

2458
05:40:44,800 --> 05:40:51,280
And then it hurt even more because I guess the pain started to settle down and I was like,

2459
05:40:58,000 --> 05:41:04,880
so it's always the littlest cuts or littlest anything that hurts the most.

2460
05:41:08,480 --> 05:41:11,760
It's the littlest cuts that hurt the most, I find.

2461
05:41:12,560 --> 05:41:21,680
I remember like cutting like a big, big like cut and I just like look at it and I'm horrified

2462
05:41:22,400 --> 05:41:23,440
seeing a big cut.

2463
05:41:28,000 --> 05:41:31,120
And then, but like it doesn't hurt much.

2464
05:41:34,400 --> 05:41:39,520
But then, you know, like a paper cut, you're like, my life is over.

2465
05:41:44,400 --> 05:41:49,680
Guess the adrenaline hits in when it's a bigger cut, but like it doesn't hit when,

2466
05:41:50,320 --> 05:41:52,400
when you have like the tiniest thing.

2467
05:41:52,960 --> 05:41:56,640
I'm tiniest cut.

2468
05:41:56,640 --> 05:41:58,240
So that's why it hurt extra.

2469
05:41:59,120 --> 05:41:59,520
I guess.

2470
05:42:02,400 --> 05:42:03,840
See your friend for more consoles?

2471
05:42:03,840 --> 05:42:04,560
Absolutely not.

2472
05:42:04,560 --> 05:42:06,080
I love her the bits.

2473
05:42:06,960 --> 05:42:14,880
Actually, I was that time after the lake, I was like, oh my gosh, I'm having so much fun.

2474
05:42:14,880 --> 05:42:19,360
And she was like, oh my gosh, we should do a sleepover like now.

2475
05:42:19,360 --> 05:42:20,160
And I said, yes.

2476
05:42:20,160 --> 05:42:25,520
And then I realized I didn't bring a spare change of clothes.

2477
05:42:26,160 --> 05:42:29,040
So then we're doing a sleepover again.

2478
05:42:34,560 --> 05:42:36,080
Sunday instead.

2479
05:42:40,240 --> 05:42:42,560
We're doing a sleepover again on Sunday.

2480
05:42:42,560 --> 05:42:44,400
It's going to be like a movie night probably.

2481
05:42:50,160 --> 05:43:03,920
Oh, she took a picture of the dog when it got home.

2482
05:43:03,920 --> 05:43:08,080
And she like immediately went to her dog bed and she and she looked so pleased.

2483
05:43:08,080 --> 05:43:09,120
So I was really happy.

2484
05:43:10,480 --> 05:43:10,960
Are you here?

2485
05:43:10,960 --> 05:43:12,640
Some of you are going to movie nights movies.

2486
05:43:14,480 --> 05:43:18,080
Actually, I wouldn't call them movie nights since they're more like TV shows.

2487
05:43:19,360 --> 05:43:23,600
Sometimes we do the dumbest thing.

2488
05:43:24,320 --> 05:43:26,640
This is, I would call it the dumbest thing.

2489
05:43:26,640 --> 05:43:35,600
The most brain dead thing you can do is that we just put on like really old like cartoon chills.

2490
05:43:35,600 --> 05:43:37,920
Like I think we put on the backyard again.

2491
05:43:38,640 --> 05:43:41,360
We put on Nanalan.

2492
05:43:46,800 --> 05:43:48,400
We put on recess.

2493
05:43:49,520 --> 05:43:54,480
Somehow we ended up watching recess two times in a row.

2494
05:44:02,400 --> 05:44:04,320
You know, like those types.

2495
05:44:04,320 --> 05:44:06,320
Is backyard against really old?

2496
05:44:06,320 --> 05:44:07,680
I think it's pretty old.

2497
05:44:07,680 --> 05:44:12,480
Oh, it's backyard against.

2498
05:44:12,720 --> 05:44:28,240
Oh, it started in 2004.

2499
05:44:28,800 --> 05:44:34,000
Yeah.

2500
05:44:38,800 --> 05:44:42,000
Everyone's sun leash fiddles up.

2501
05:44:48,000 --> 05:44:50,800
I think I also watched like a bunch of...

2502
05:44:50,800 --> 05:44:52,960
Oh yeah, like watching Arthur as well.

2503
05:44:53,680 --> 05:44:55,600
You know, just watching like cartoons.

2504
05:44:58,800 --> 05:45:00,720
You know, thinking about it now.

2505
05:45:01,760 --> 05:45:06,160
Like I remember looking at recess and I'm like, I totally did not.

2506
05:45:07,440 --> 05:45:10,800
I totally did not.

2507
05:45:15,600 --> 05:45:20,800
I totally did not get any of these jokes when I was younger.

2508
05:45:28,560 --> 05:45:34,640
Like sometimes like, that flew over my head.

2509
05:45:38,160 --> 05:45:39,280
A lot of recess.

2510
05:45:39,280 --> 05:45:44,800
I was like, wait, that totally flew over my head.

2511
05:45:53,040 --> 05:45:54,000
So yeah, I was like, oh.

2512
05:45:58,240 --> 05:46:12,240
Sometimes I'm just like really surprised about some of the jokes and recess.

2513
05:46:13,360 --> 05:46:14,960
Like what the teachers talk about.

2514
05:46:14,960 --> 05:46:17,760
I'm like, that's pretty grim.

2515
05:46:17,840 --> 05:46:31,520
But yeah, I'm just like, oh, you know, just rewatching things.

2516
05:46:31,520 --> 05:46:32,880
I think I even watched...

2517
05:46:32,880 --> 05:46:41,280
Oh shoot, I gotta Google this one just to make sure it's not like a local thing.

2518
05:46:47,760 --> 05:47:05,280
Okay, it's not local, but it's not local, but it's Canadian.

2519
05:47:10,000 --> 05:47:11,920
It's not global, that's for sure.

2520
05:47:11,920 --> 05:47:13,280
It's Canadian.

2521
05:47:17,840 --> 05:47:21,360
It might out me.

2522
05:47:34,400 --> 05:47:35,920
No, it won't out me.

2523
05:47:35,920 --> 05:47:36,800
It won't out me at all.

2524
05:47:38,400 --> 05:47:44,000
Okay, it was called Dudley the Dragon.

2525
05:47:44,720 --> 05:47:50,560
It might, it says here, it's like shown in the U.S. a bit too.

2526
05:47:52,560 --> 05:47:54,400
It's called Dudley the Dragon.

2527
05:47:59,120 --> 05:48:00,400
Watched a bit of that.

2528
05:48:02,160 --> 05:48:05,840
Oh, watched Mona the Vampire, those type of stuff.

2529
05:48:06,160 --> 05:48:18,480
It's, I don't know, I really liked, I really liked like children's media.

2530
05:48:25,680 --> 05:48:32,960
So yeah, I think one media that people don't remember.

2531
05:48:36,800 --> 05:48:42,960
Canadian, Canadian media that people don't remember, but I do is...

2532
05:48:50,080 --> 05:48:56,320
Okay, it's called, god damn it, when was it released?

2533
05:48:58,320 --> 05:49:01,040
Okay, I don't think, I don't think it's gonna like,

2534
05:49:01,040 --> 05:49:05,760
I think it was ongoing for a while too.

2535
05:49:05,760 --> 05:49:10,160
Anyways, it was called Yvonne of the Yukon.

2536
05:49:16,080 --> 05:49:20,560
I bet if I watched that again, I would be like, oh my gosh, there's so many jokes now.

2537
05:49:20,720 --> 05:49:35,520
I remember watching this and I had a great time watching it.

2538
05:49:38,080 --> 05:49:40,080
I had a great, great time watching it.

2539
05:49:41,040 --> 05:49:49,600
Isn't Canada, there's some media about, maybe it used to be 50% French?

2540
05:49:50,160 --> 05:49:52,320
No, it should be 50% Canadian.

2541
05:49:58,480 --> 05:50:01,040
Not just French, I think in...

2542
05:50:10,320 --> 05:50:22,400
I think in, in Quebec though, like, everything must be 50% French and English,

2543
05:50:23,600 --> 05:50:26,800
but the main language should be French.

2544
05:50:32,720 --> 05:50:34,960
I think, I can't quite remember.

2545
05:50:35,040 --> 05:50:41,200
But let's be real though, actually most media that came, like media that I watched,

2546
05:50:41,200 --> 05:50:44,480
also came from Quebec, so, you know.

2547
05:50:51,600 --> 05:50:57,440
So yeah, I ended up having, liking a lot, actually the cartoons, there were so many

2548
05:50:57,440 --> 05:50:59,760
cartoons and I think I just enjoyed all of them.

2549
05:51:00,400 --> 05:51:07,200
I just enjoyed a lot of cartoons when I, when I was younger.

2550
05:51:08,640 --> 05:51:11,280
I watched a lot of experimental ones too.

2551
05:51:11,280 --> 05:51:14,640
Some of them might be even like, lost media now.

2552
05:51:22,080 --> 05:51:26,080
Some things might be like lost media now, because sometimes I try to remember

2553
05:51:27,040 --> 05:51:30,880
a show, I remember it quite vividly and then I can't find it.

2554
05:51:33,120 --> 05:51:34,560
And I'm like, oh, it's gone.

2555
05:51:36,080 --> 05:51:37,200
It's gone forever!

2556
05:51:40,480 --> 05:51:45,520
But I think there, there was quite a robust amount of cartoons.

2557
05:51:56,640 --> 05:51:58,160
I'm so yapping, holy shit.

2558
05:52:08,480 --> 05:52:09,360
It's okay.

2559
05:52:09,360 --> 05:52:10,560
How long did I yapp for?

2560
05:52:22,080 --> 05:52:22,560
Tired.

2561
05:52:26,800 --> 05:52:30,000
At least an hour.

2562
05:52:31,440 --> 05:52:32,240
An hour?

2563
05:52:32,240 --> 05:52:33,680
A little over an hour?

2564
05:52:33,680 --> 05:52:34,720
About an hour mostly?

2565
05:52:35,920 --> 05:52:36,560
Like an hour.

2566
05:52:36,560 --> 05:52:38,800
I feel like you're all lying to me.

2567
05:52:38,800 --> 05:52:40,480
I feel like it's been over an hour.

2568
05:52:42,800 --> 05:52:51,040
Anyways, I have some chores to do tomorrow.

2569
05:52:51,920 --> 05:53:00,160
I have some choice to do tomorrow and

2570
05:53:04,880 --> 05:53:08,000
and I gotta get ready for the ASMR stream.

2571
05:53:09,040 --> 05:53:15,680
For the ASMR stream, I'd like to reiterate that I may not be able to interact as much maybe,

2572
05:53:15,680 --> 05:53:19,520
or I might take, might or might not take requests depending on which.

2573
05:53:21,120 --> 05:53:27,600
So yeah, that's about it for today.

2574
05:53:27,600 --> 05:53:29,040
I can't think of anything else.

2575
05:53:29,680 --> 05:53:31,120
I was yapping for a long time.

2576
05:53:31,120 --> 05:53:32,640
I'm pretty sure I'm yapping for a long time.

2577
05:53:32,640 --> 05:53:37,680
Anyways, I do have choice, so I gotta go.

2578
05:53:37,680 --> 05:53:52,960
So anything else to cover?

2579
05:53:52,960 --> 05:53:53,360
No?

2580
05:53:53,360 --> 05:53:53,760
Oh yeah.

2581
05:53:59,040 --> 05:54:03,280
Use code mercy at GamerSup for 10% off your order.

2582
05:54:03,280 --> 05:54:07,520
Your order.

2583
05:54:12,640 --> 05:54:14,720
Also, also, also.

2584
05:54:15,840 --> 05:54:17,600
I feel like you all should comment more.

2585
05:54:20,080 --> 05:54:21,680
I feel like you all should comment more.

2586
05:54:21,920 --> 05:54:33,760
I feel like you all should comment more on the VODs.

2587
05:54:33,760 --> 05:54:34,880
Yeah, like on the VODs.

2588
05:54:34,880 --> 05:54:39,920
Like, comment, subscribe on YouTube.

2589
05:54:44,080 --> 05:54:51,040
And as well, oh shoot, I should have said this at the beginning of the stream.

2590
05:54:51,680 --> 05:55:06,560
But if you guys ever find something or you remember a part you liked in the stream,

2591
05:55:06,560 --> 05:55:07,680
please clip it.

2592
05:55:07,680 --> 05:55:19,280
I would highly recommend it because it helps me choose what parts are good to make into shorts.

2593
05:55:19,280 --> 05:55:31,040
And so please just clip it.

2594
05:55:31,040 --> 05:55:33,840
Just clip the part using the YouTube Clipper.

2595
05:55:33,840 --> 05:55:49,200
Cool?

2596
05:55:49,200 --> 05:55:51,200
And that's about it, I think.

2597
05:55:55,600 --> 05:55:58,160
Yeah, just like clip, just do the regular clipping.

2598
05:55:58,160 --> 05:55:59,440
Like how you would on Twitch.

2599
05:55:59,680 --> 05:56:06,640
I would like to remember some of the parts that were cool as well.

2600
05:56:10,480 --> 05:56:11,440
YouTube has a clip tool?

2601
05:56:11,440 --> 05:56:12,000
Yeah, it does.

2602
05:56:13,760 --> 05:56:15,840
It's new.

2603
05:56:19,520 --> 05:56:25,040
And so I'll take those parts and then I'll send them off to scrawny who will send them off to

2604
05:56:25,040 --> 05:56:30,800
an editor and then should we share the clip too?

2605
05:56:30,800 --> 05:56:33,040
Oh, you don't have to share it, only if you want to.

2606
05:56:35,680 --> 05:56:46,640
Only if you want to, only if you want to.

2607
05:56:46,640 --> 05:56:53,120
But I always go back and check them every once in a while and see what parts you guys like best.

2608
05:56:53,200 --> 05:56:59,600
And maybe it'll be a video and maybe it could be our little ha ha inside joke together.

2609
05:57:04,880 --> 05:57:07,600
I'm not going to force your hand, but I would appreciate it.

2610
05:57:07,600 --> 05:57:13,840
I really appreciate everyone who who clips because it makes making shorts and

2611
05:57:14,800 --> 05:57:18,000
seeing the fun times way easier.

2612
05:57:23,040 --> 05:57:25,040
It makes it way way way easier.

2613
05:57:31,680 --> 05:57:34,400
I always should say that, but I just remember

2614
05:57:36,880 --> 05:57:40,560
I always remember that I should probably say it.

2615
05:57:44,240 --> 05:57:49,360
Yeah, so thank you so much for joining me today.

2616
05:57:49,360 --> 05:57:50,160
I'm a yeet.

2617
05:57:51,760 --> 05:57:52,880
I don't think anyone's on.

2618
05:57:53,520 --> 05:57:54,160
I'm a yeet.

2619
05:57:54,160 --> 05:57:59,120
So I'll see you all again next time.

2620
05:58:00,400 --> 05:58:02,080
Bye bye.

2621
05:58:03,120 --> 05:58:04,720
Stream for Mercy.

2622
05:58:04,720 --> 05:58:13,680
Bye bye.
