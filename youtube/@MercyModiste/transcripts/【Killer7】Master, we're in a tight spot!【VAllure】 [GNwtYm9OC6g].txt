You see where the text says ISZK?
That would be so funny.
Oh, thank goodness it's not.
It would be so funny, but thank goodness it's not.
I know it's like, oh, we can totally,

An evolved heaven smile with boosted explosive power.

They'll be on top of you the moment you open the door.
Well, shit, stairs.
Senpai, I might be fucking stupid.

He said a door.
As soon as you get through the door, there was no fucking door.
I was like, what fucking door?
I'm going back.
I forgot how to heal.
Blood recovery.
Okay, there we go.
Okay.
Door equals stairs.
When he said door, I was like, oh, door, door, not stairs, corridor.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Am I kind of stupid?
Yes.
I didn't realize there was another corridor.
Which?
Which one?
There you are.

Yeah, yeah, fuck you.
Yeah, I can do counter attacks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And speed or waver or power.
Waver is the wiggliness.

Maybe less wiggly, so we'll do the waver.
Okay.
Counter attack.
Okay, cool.
No, I did not.
Okay, we need any more blood now.
Ah, shit, which...
Which way did I go?

Whoo!
The other way, wasn't it?
It was the other way.
Oh my gosh.
You scared me, bondage son.

Master, we're in a tight spot.
Things are turning in a bad way.
An infamous criminal lies this way.
And he's protecting him.
Wicked bad partners, indeed, indeed.
Ah, yes.
Seek out the soul shells.
With soul shells.
He was sure to allow you in the name of Harman.
I didn't read that fast.
How fucked am I, Senpai?
Wait.
Let me go back.
Again.
And...
Iwazaru, I need to look at the instructions again.
Okay, master, blah blah blah.

Without blood, there is no tomorrow.
Because how do I do the special again?
Personas can absorb the blood out of the enemy.
Access stabilizer to help handle multiple personalities.

Ain't even funny how tight it is.
Once you open the door, there's no turning back, master.
Well, you can come back, but I mean that's the gravity of the situation.
Don't get me wrong.
Like a prelude to later battles, you know?
You must take it very seriously.
The name of Harmon.
Please help me.

Anyways, are you getting along with the chief?
Straight up, I was waiting for you the whole time.
Yeah, I know.
Don't be mad at me, man.
Don't glare at me like that.
The chief will wake up.
Really, I'm sorry.
The other chief must be rolling on the floor with laughter.
Hello talk.
Vision ring? What does vision ring do?
I think we'll be fine to understand what he's doing.
Vision ring is how you scan for enemies.
Wasn't that what I was doing?

Our four children served their purpose.
They didn't die.
But our other nine children were killed by you.
What do you want from us?
Is it so bad that we have a purpose in life?
We are only serving our gods.
At Heaven's command, we will kill the unwanted.
Let's get rid of bad trees from their roots.
I hope you are not one of them.
A white child gets past your bedtime.

Who's that thing popping around?
Where's the guy?
Got it.
Alright, guy from Tekken.
Ah yes, nothing has changed for 30 years, no matter how many times you try, the result will be the same.
Ah yes, like our chess games, you always seem to win.
You're a bad player, senpai.
You're a good friend, but unfortunately, our interest is not mutual.
We both have become burdened with so much, and we don't have time for fun anymore.
There's always time for fun.
Let's dance.

That's not peace!
In the year 2002, a network of intercontinental expressways bridging the Atlantic Ocean opened,
connecting the two major sides of the world.
We have to drive
The construction of a mass-scale distribution system began and the man-made landmass as large as a city
Was built over an ocean
The use and research of nuclear energy was banned and all radioactive waste and materials were disposed of where at an energy
Disposal facility in the Gibbs soft islands. Is that good set of islands off the coast of the Indian Ocean
Is this anime international eyes were on the elimination of the intercontinental missiles that posed the biggest threat to world peace
In order to eliminate these weapons of mass destruction
They were launched outside the Earth's atmosphere and intercepted by other missiles
Exploding them on contact
People around the world watch these explosions light up the sky as if they were some kind of dazzling light show
These explosions later known as the missile show missiles became the symbol of world peace
Wait, isn't that kind of violent for a world peace new threat was on the rise
At the signing ceremony of the UN's world security treaty in the year 2003 a new breed of terrorists who called themselves
smiling faces
The devastating attack caught the international society by surprise and
temporarily crippled key operations in the United Nations
That assault was aimed at nothing other than using terrorism to create terror
Well fear spread throughout the nations like people die when they are killed
There was nothing the police of the military could do to counter the smiling faces
The only one who had any chance of stopping these smiling faces
Were the omniscient and almost godlike professional assassins
The key players behind the scenes of the four powers utilized their connections and called upon the group known as
Killer seven
Their only hope rested with them. Oh my gosh, they title dropped it
Yes, the election is right. Yeah, have you decided on your vote? Yeah
Have a nice day

Yeah, motion sickness strikes again, I think I liked four because it was on the ds
I
About smt-3 remaster
Did that game give you motion sickness? Oh, not as much. It didn't give me as much motion sickness
But but I wasn't really moving in this like kind of open world thing. I guess
So, yeah
So does playing in windowed mode help? Um
Not really not really to be honest
Um
Not really
It doesn't matter what side I think a smaller screen is better though, but it's still kind of like oh, I'm still kind of dizzy, you know
Um, I don't like smt-3 that much because it's really punishing and hard
I'm a baby. I'm a baby when it comes to gaming. I want my games to be relaxing and easy
so that's why I play on easy mode and then
Don't tell other smt fans that I play on easy mode because it's uh
I like I like I like relaxing and going with the story and then
um
SMT fans will be like, why aren't you playing it on hard? Why are you playing it hard? What is wrong with you?
So that's our little secret, okay
That's our little secret
Haha
We're in a tight spot. This feel is extraordinary. This brat can run like the wind
Perfect for long tracks

Press the y button to use it
The name of Harman
Oh
My arms a little bit
My arms a little bit what do you call it? Um
Acting up so I might have to go ice it some pie
Yeah
I have to go ice it again probably
Oh, yeah, by the way, I hate matador. I hate matador
The moment I got to matador and sm t3. I was like son of a whore
Isn't it both arms now? Yeah, it's both arms, but one arm is way more than than the rest
Anyways, I'm gonna go ice it
Yeah
We all ice it
Well, I'm gonna grab ice and then no wait. Can I I can't play with one hand shit. We're gonna have a little uh
Yap session when I come back with the ice. Yeah
Yeah, and then we'll uh, yeah
Yeah
I'll be right back
So
So
So
So
So
So
So
So
So
So
So
Are you are you playing ping pong?
Senpai
Well senpai I am icing my arm right now
Right
Now so uh, I have to hold it on my arm so I can't play the game until it's like iced again
So everyone
Why do you always play ping pong? Why is it ping pong?
Settle in for some yapping. Yeah, we'll do a little bit of yapping
Before I continue well, I'll put this back back down by the sink and then if I need it again, I'll just pick it up again
so um
Yeah, my arm is very very very itchy. It looks so much better
Than it did like two days ago
Senpai like two days ago
It looks so bad. It looks so bad. I was like
Luckily all the games I was playing were like super easy or like could be played with one hand
Like you know
Any like walking stuff or like visual novels. It's just like dun dun dun dun dun. This one requires me to be actually you know
Good
So
Um, I was able to like rest my ice pack beside me and then kind of like just play with one hand
But um
Maybe you should change the schedule then uh, I still want to play killer seven
We'll just have to ice it so my arms when they flare up like they get so hot
That the ice melts that the ice melts and I can't even feel that the ice pack is cold
But if I put it like on my leg or something it's it's like oh, it's cold
But it feels like
It's not
When I put it on
It doesn't even feel cold
Uh
Fortunately killer seven isn't very intense. Yeah, it's not intense, but I it still requires two hands
But um, yeah, the doctor was checking the rest of my body to see if uh
Uh
If she could see if there were any anywhere else that it happened and she's like, oh, yeah, you got some on your legs
and
Uh, as I was at the doctor, I was like rashing up on the other side
On the other arm. I was like, ah
You know, I have a fever call. Hi. That's the first thing I checked. The first thing I checked was okay now. It's cold. Um
Um
The first thing I checked and mama mama mercy checked was uh
Was was to see if I had a fever
And
And uh, she was like, oh no, no
There's no fever. So we're good there
Time to wash everything in your life. Trust me. I already did
Uh, right now my my bed sheets are in
the laundry
Do you ever find the cause of the rash? I have no idea. I have no idea senpai
I have no idea
I literally woke up
And I was like my arm's really itchy. Why and then suddenly my entire arm became
Like very quickly when I woke up
Became all rash and I was like panicking. I was like, oh my god. What do I do?
Oh
It's very itchy. That's probably
the most
Annoying part of it and it's on my dominant arm. I think the most itchiest parts are like at the wrist and the elbows
So that's why I was like
I took a shower just in case it was like an allergy like contact allergy and it was still there. So I was like, oh
The food allergies, um, I don't know
Usually if I have a food allergy, it's like the entire body
goals into
goals until like
issue
Maybe you have bed bugs. Um
highly unlikely
And I'm pretty because these are definitely not bites because I went to the doctor
She was like, oh, yeah allergies is definitely something allergy related
Um, do you use ac? Uh, no, actually it's been quite cold recently
No changes in washing detergents or anything. No
No, nothing
Thank you for the super chat charlie
I'm not reading that
Sorry not right now not right now
Maybe new clothes. Yeah. Yeah, maybe maybe it's new clothes. I mean like
It did happen when when uh, mama mercy
Mama mercy was like, oh, I'm gonna give you my old clothes
And I said, okay, so I got her old clothes that she wore when
Um
When she was like younger and then I guess I wore some of those and I don't know maybe
Maybe
It would have been that but it was like washed
That might be the reason
but
I don't know it could have been

Mm-hmm, but the moment you step out of those town those town boundaries or if you go underground
I will know the moment that signal is lost. Kabooie
Kabooie
What if there's a cheese case factor in the next town I said and up
You can it's include it's included in the next town
Like big metropolis
Uh town or boonies town. Oh half and half
I guess it's kind of like normal
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how like what normal is it has a downtown
It has a downtown and big buildings big business buildings. It's still it's still like a nice place to visit
Thank you senpai for the five super please drink response to play response to boy
I don't know. I wouldn't call it a city. I wouldn't call it a city. I would call it like a town still
Oh man
A principality, I don't know like it still has like malls and stuff so
buildings
But I don't think it's particularly huge, you know
I don't think it's particularly huge. It'll be like, I don't know. I would still consider it a town
Then again huge my differ between people
Basement is all we need. Is there a population minimum we're considering? Uh, I don't know
I don't know maybe 500,000 700,000 is a town, right?
And I trade the tracker in and instead be a house husband
I know how to cook. What can you cook? What is your best meal?
and
okay, well
Make sure your liver's okay if you're drinking
A town is about 10% of that. Oh
Okay, then the next city over you'll have so much ability to move
I may not be able to cook but I have great credit score and stable mental health
Okay, you know what that's that's that's one up from a lot of us. I have
I have a lot of I have meadow illinois
As all vtubers do. I mean, I told you I told you I had like my weekly breakdown
So, uh, but I can make phone calls. I can make phone calls and appointments
I
Can make appointments and phone calls and I can drive so I don't know one step closer
That's one step closer to like, you know
Oh and my credit score is fine too my credit score is fine
Oh
Driving what a showoff. Yeah, I drive I drive the family minivan
Oh, you laugh like a dolphin. That's it. I know I know I know
There are several laughs that I have
I think
I've been called a windshield wiper. I've been called a squeaky door. I've been called a dolphin
Are you an aggressive driver? Not particularly. I consider myself a defensive driver
T kettle is what I think of I think most people say it's windshield wiper
Or like, you know, when you put windex on a cloth and go squeak squeak squeak, that's what some of my laughs sound like
Find your laugh really cute. Thank you. I feel like it's one of my, um, charm points
Charm points? Yeah, I think it's one of my charm points
Sometimes I sound like a creaky door too
I
It's one of my charm points definitely something that uh people take notice of even IRL
Uh, I don't know what my other charm points are my inability to read
Okay, we're almost done Senpai. Sorry. Sorry about that
We're almost done
Oh
I think my other charm point would be
Uh, I guess maybe you've noticed I make a lot of mouth noises
A lot of mouth noises where it's like
You're also the first VTuber that plays SMT outside of persona. That's hella charming. What is my charm point the type of games I play?
That can't be that can't be it, right? My gamer scores might it's my um
It's my charm point only if you play knock turn on normal
Uh
Part of it I've never seen anyone play harvester I
Seriously, I feel like I played very early on and when I started streaming
Uh, that's such a long time ago when I say such a long time ago. That's like three years
three years ago, um
I
Play nothing about pointing clicks. So now I'm running out of pointing clicks. I'm running out of pointing clicks to play
I mean I could play it again, but I don't know it just loses this magic if you like play again
I mean with the crowd I think
I
Can't play visual novels next I have
two visual novels
that I want to I want to read
with senpai one is completely uh
Not great
One is completely not great and probably would be a turnoff to a lot of people, but I'm waiting for uh
Oh
It's an ad friendly. No, I'm waiting for the uh, hold on
Streams
And the other one I'm thinking is dona dona
Uh
But the other one is uh
Is uh
Poilet stuff
Let's just say that
It's a bit it's a funny considered the worst one of the worst vns
Ever made
It's not great, but it is comedic
It is comedic and it's really gross. It's really gross
I think some of you already know it. I see it in chat already
I see it in chat already. I think it'll be funny at least
It's gross
But funny
So I think that'll be an interesting stream
Definitely not one where you're like
I'm gonna jork it's more like morbid curiosity
I'm gonna I'm that's my
That's my
You know assumption my assumption
My assumption I mean like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna shame you for what you like but at the same time
I'm going to guess
It's
Not exactly like a a a a
It's one that people are going to miss out on yes, just because of the subject
Just because of the subject so I think that one is
For fun and I definitely don't expect anyone to be like
I'm I'm cumin
I don't expect anything
Anyone to be like I'm cumin and I'm expecting a much less big audience for that one than my other ones
I'm also interested in playing. Um
Some really gory ones
Like I think what was it megad bites bites is that one?
Uh and
I
Megan baits. Yeah baits. Yeah
Um
And
Maybe muvelove muvelove I hear muvelove is like one of those games that it's like a must to play
Well the stream is on the other platform be paywall. No it will not
uh
I'm planning what I'm planning for the other stream
Is uh for a little funsy onesie
Um, it's free as long as you follow because we don't want any uh, we don't want any trouble
We don't want any twubble right so it's free if you follow and uh
With some incentives
Yeah
With some incentives
For donations very uh
Interactive incentives, yes
But yes, it will be free
It will be free. I don't plan on like
Paywalling that it's a streaming site. I feel like it's it shouldn't be pay walled
Incentives to help keep the vibes, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, the good vibes going
We're free of course
Um, but you have to in my plan my plan is that you have to follow
And also, um, I don't know. I don't know but I saw a lot of people asking if like vods will be like up
Uh, you see the thing is on the other website. There is no vods. There are no vods vods do not get saved
So I don't think so
Oh, yeah, I people are like, oh, can we watch the mods for free and I'm like, I don't even think there is vods
There I don't think there is vods
Yeah, you recorded yourself. Yeah, I don't feel like that maybe
The question is where to host it. I know. Oh, yeah, uh hosting stuff seems
hard
I'll I'll I'll talk to strongy about it. I'll talk to strongy and management about it when the time comes
Because uh, right now I want to focus on my youtube stuff
I want to focus on my youtube stuff or for funsies
and also because, um
You know
In the end I do want to be seen as like sort of
Not not I don't want to be seen as
A brand risk
Oh, okay, that sounds so bad when I say it. I don't want to be seen as like a brand risk where I I might like, um
Um
I might I might cause some of my friends company to be like, no, no, you can't you can't collab with with her. I don't want that
I don't want that. Oh, I'll wait for like 10k. Maybe I'll wait until 10k for like fans extremes. Who knows?
So
Yeah, I just want to be sure. Oh, what did I didn't censor? Oh man, my bad
You didn't hear that
um
I don't want I don't want to like, uh, I don't want to make people uncomfortable, right? Like public a public facing
I want to be seen as
Uh pretty decent, but uh privately. I'm just uh in alternate places. Uh, we're free. We got free reign. We got free reign
You got free reign
You only stream on youtube. Yeah, I only stream on youtube. Yeah
Anything that I said before that was all fake fake news
Um
Yeah, I just want to make sure that when it comes to corpals because I have a lot of friends
in like different corporal
Which I I would love to you know, uh
It was uh
Definitely something that I want
I want to like hang out with my other friends and I don't want to become like a brand risk where it's like
Oh, I can never work with my friends ever again, you know
But I definitely don't mind having that other image. Uh
Behind behind places where if you want that content you search for it
That's kind of thing
Viola is kind of a brand risk in itself. I think personally some pie
I think we're really not that different from any other, uh companies
There's a lot of companies that also do uh alternate. Um
asmr stuff
so
I feel like um
We're not
Really different from any other company. Um
The advertisement as we are a little bit on the the the spicier side. I feel like that's definitely to capture attention
That's definitely to capture attention and we do advertise advertise it
But that's the only difference
I
Don't think it's even as spicy or other corpse can get away with with it
Yeah, it's the kind of hook
It's a bit more I feel like it's not as spicy in my opinion
I feel like it's quite normal
Okay, okay, um senpai's I'm gonna have to go up again and put away the ice pack because it's completely melted here
It's completely melted
So I'm gonna put it back in the freezer
So
So
So
Senpai's playing games here, okay now we now we're gaming
Now we're gaming I'm sorry about the long intermission senpai. Sorry about the long intermission
Yeah, it looks like I I'll be able to continue playing
Okay, we're gonna game we're gaming
I need to click on the screen
There it is
But yeah
Fruitful fruitful conversation. I hope I hope
That's my plan. Um, at least that's my plan
but if uh
If management's like no or if scrawny's like, I don't know then uh all that plan gone
All that plan is gone
Or our might change a bit
Coyote

That's what kai day's blood can do
Sometimes her arms suck blood. That's some stuff. I didn't need to see either
Masked a smith is still a mystery
But I do know that he can do some sweet wrestling moves
He was a small town pro wrestler who drew crowds to main events
But just before he made his debut in the new york scene. He mysteriously disappeared
This is common knowledge amongst fans

If you have a minute to share good share
It could open your eyes
Pan doesn't have its own defense system
Its survival is contingent in the United States as far as the homeland is concerned Japan is extra baggage
Its usefulness as an ally is long past
Straight up it ain't worth saving you see
That's reality for you so chief you still gonna do it
You
Know what it's meant by fireworks. They're missiles explosion that occur when missiles
Collide oh sure. It's a beautiful sight indeed
But you'll only see it if the defense system is activated
Really I went all the way here and all I got was Travis a

Fatality is still good though
And I want to save point
Downstairs
Wait, there was another room right hold on was there another room no, there was just Harman's room hold on sorry
I
I
Power lunch
The owner Fukushima is mixed up in all sorts of things even the International Ethics Committee is getting involved
Chief you watch yourself
The ethics agents or hyenas are a motley crew of rejects, but the assassins trained in the core
Now those guys are what about after the Yakumo party cabinet policy or Yakumo for short
It's just a bunch of paper, but it can change the world you end party my friend

Continuing my report Kevin Smith never fails to amaze you won't believe this but it's the straight-up truth
The sucker is a real-life invisible man. Oh
Plenty I teach an interesting name
Why must they taught me like that?
At first even I didn't believe it. This has got to be a hoax, right? Oh shit the guys for real and
Then con Smith what a pain in the ass punk?
I can never catch him it blows my socks off nine times. He speeds off. He disappears
That's right. This appears Olympic records mean nothing with him running around
Coyote Smith has a thing a
Thing for being a crook, but he's not like other thugs. He's fit. He jumps like an animal incredible
Athleticism not to mention he can pick any padlock
Must pick this up as a method of survival in a rough neighborhood and then there's Garcia and Smith
I really haven't seen much seeing him much so everything. I know is based on conjecture
You and rumor has it he can spot the heavens mile a mile away
This character is no joke going up against monsters like that. My investigation continues Johnny Gagman
Is this the way it was Zaru you spoke to me again
Master, this is bad
It's just can't be good at all
Be sure about that mask
Master you must have doubts or I would think I'm wearing a bit. That's for sure
Whenever you get in tight spot you break out your silly wrestling moves. I can't you bury the past

We're good. We're good right now. I think I'm sorry. I played I played only about like an hour ish of this
It was I had to ice my arm for most of most of the stream I apologize for that
But now I'm tired and I think it's a result of my nausea pills wearing off a bit I
Think it's cuz of the nausea pills
But yeah, let's go to just chatting

I did read that one and I'm really I'm so new to this senpai
I'm so new to like reading Supas and having membas. I'm just like what what is the etiquette?
What is the etiquette of like doing this I know that like I
Know that like a lot of people
A lot of people say things for the end of stream, but I'm just like
That's that's okay, right?
That's okay to like kind of do some of them at the end of stream and some of them like in the middle, right?
I'm not really sure
And I really share
It's your call really
That's good to do either way. It's all about the mullet
And it depends on the screen okay, cuz I'm just like oh, I don't really know
I
Don't really know the etiquette, but whoa, whoa, we'll see
Yeah, we'll see we'll see I'll I'll I'll get it some pie. I'll get it some pie

YouTube streams
but
They didn't have rays or anything
They didn't have any of the stuff
I wonder how reading soup buzz and effects engagement I have no idea
The only time I kind of know about soup buzz is
is with like hollow live and
I don't know. I feel like that's kind of we don't play by that rule because
Obviously, it's not as big of a
Of a of a crowd
Different standards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
I
Something like that, you know like
I'm just a small fish I'm just a small fish
I'm just a small fish in the sea of beautiful v2 birds
I'm just a small fish with a
strange laugh a
Squawky voice and and a perchance for for murder
I
Perchance incline. Yeah
I'll say you'll notice that I'll say sayings very wrong
You
Your sub count ain't gonna be small fish for
Long with how fast it's expanding you won't be you won't just be a big yo won't just be a big fish soon soon
You'll be jaws

Oh
Perchance just reminded me of the essay. That's what I'm referencing
I wasn't an explosion. I can't remember. Oh, man. It was an explosion, right? Wait. No spoilers
Jaws has been out since
Wait, how long?
