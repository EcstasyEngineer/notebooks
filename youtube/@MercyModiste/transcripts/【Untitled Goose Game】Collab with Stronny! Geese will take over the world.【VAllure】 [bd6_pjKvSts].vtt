28:47.520 --> 28:53.920
the tiny little thing again there's only one map this game was so expensive and you're telling me

28:53.920 --> 29:01.280

31:43.600 --> 31:46.640
you have goose in your garden oh no no no you're not alone

31:47.680 --> 31:50.080

i took his head

31:56.800 --> 32:00.080
oh no i have terrible news i think we're actually gonna have to reset

32:00.080 --> 32:02.640
i don't think i can play with these controls

32:04.480 --> 32:06.960
okay it's okay i'm willing to reset

32:08.080 --> 32:12.160
yes okay we can probably speedrun this to be honest i have no idea

32:12.240 --> 32:15.920
so hold on i'm gonna hide my game just in case i show anything that shit i'm not

32:15.920 --> 32:18.720
i need to hide my game input uh

32:20.240 --> 32:24.400
if i quit and then invite you on local co-op that should work right sure

32:24.960 --> 32:33.600
i'm gonna hide my game too just in case my game capture now sometimes can't can't you can't see

32:35.120 --> 32:39.040
do funny things oh you've done mouse and keyboard did you mean to do that

32:39.120 --> 32:43.120
wait no that was me that did that was you it was yes it was me i was like

32:43.120 --> 32:45.920
hmm you did that so fast mercy i don't remember inviting you hmm

32:47.120 --> 32:50.800
i think it's because we're still there are you still in this instance

32:50.800 --> 32:52.240
or did i need to send you a new instance

32:54.880 --> 33:02.160
no that was you that was that was you okay i think it should be fine now

33:03.040 --> 33:05.360
okay hold on all right you move around

33:06.320 --> 33:11.760
and let's get out of this bush first oh yeah they are blind hold on what

33:12.720 --> 33:18.400
dream capture gooski i will wow how bizarre

33:21.040 --> 33:22.800
wait is this like is this a bug

33:25.760 --> 33:29.840
how strange right i'm just going to do mouse and keyboard give me one more shot mercy one more

33:29.840 --> 33:36.400
shot okay one more shot give me one more chance i will do mouse and keyboard and because i think

33:36.400 --> 33:42.400
that's what's clashing for some random reason take that out i don't need that in my pc

33:43.600 --> 33:49.280
okay begin two player i would like to use mouse and keyboard and i will use i may use controller

33:51.440 --> 33:58.160
okay we did it you need to probably swap who player one is i was player one last time i think

34:00.320 --> 34:04.880
okay space bar is honk i mean you need to quickly relearn all of the

34:07.680 --> 34:14.240
maybe are we the only one's an experience to ever have this bug before

34:14.240 --> 34:18.960

34:28.480 --> 34:35.200
i'm on my knees give me one more chance is all i ask can you okay another suggestion was to start

34:35.200 --> 34:41.360
you go first controller off and then join in okay we're trying we're trying okay

34:44.720 --> 34:51.760

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.520
Is there a complete Little Nightmare confirmation?

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.520
Confirmation time.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.200
Confirmation any Little Nightmare-ers?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.440
We love dino-nuggies.

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.160
Hello, mister.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.800
I'm playing with your lacrosse.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.360
Uh, well, I do objectives. Let's see what our objectives are.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.760
Make someone break the fancy vase.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.360
Help the woman dress up the bust.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.400
Make the man spit out his tea.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.240
Get dressed up with a ribbon.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.760
Make the man go barefoot.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.440
Do the washing.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.280
What?!

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.280
Are we supposed to go into, like, different gardens?

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.520
Oh, wait! This is the man spit out his tea.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.320
Um...

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.160
Yeah, here's your hat.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.120
How do we make someone spit their tea out?

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.120
That's so specific.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.720
Get trapped, nerd.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.800
Okay, he keeps taking his hat back, but how do we...

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.600
Maybe if we wait for him to get his tea, and then he won't get him.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.800
Ah, I'm off work.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.040
Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, agreed.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:04.640
Okay, let's watch this gentleman try and have his tea.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.800
Well, hello there.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.240
There's a lady across the fence. Hi! Are you friendly?

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:11.920
Probably, no.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.120
Is anyone friendly, honestly? I don't think so.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.720
Special rules.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.280
Oh, ribbon!

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.000
Ta-da!

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.840
Uh, uh...

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.280
Hello?

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.520
Make her break the vase!

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.360
Oh, the vase, the vase!

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.680
See this fucking thing?

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.120
Man, fuck this thing.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.000
I'm putting this one thing in particular. Uh, everything else.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.240
Oh, her wee bra's on the line.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.360
I know she got wee socks as well.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.880
Wah.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.800
Uh...

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:50.040
I'm stoke. I'm stoke.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.760
Hello? No, no, no, no.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.840
No, hold on. The camera movement's making me a little bit deezy.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.240
Oh, no!

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.240
Are you feeling a bit sick?

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.840
Yeah, just give me a moment.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.800
If you feel too sick, it's okay. We can post-trap.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.160
I ain't gonna force you to play if you feel sick.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.840
I didn't realize the camera was so unsteady.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.240
Yeah, it was just like...

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.720
Aw, this is so cute.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:22.040
We can just do this in the film.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:26.600
She's staring at me!

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.480
Is she gonna break it?

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.040
No.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.320
Oh! Oh my god, let me dress you up!

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.160
Okay!

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.560
Oh, wait a minute.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.720
Wait, that's our mare's knee.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.400
That's literally our bow. That's her entire design.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.360
Listen, I have a bow on my chest!

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.120
Exactly.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.720
And technically, your bow and your skirt is your skirt?

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.400
Yeah, it is on the back of your skirt, as I don't...

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.600
Oh, there's like a wee frog thing.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.720
Oh, a little inter-

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.440
Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to...

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.320
Take your thing.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.240
Is it a bell?

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.200
Uh, why do you even have that, lady?

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.040
Is that how we break the statue?

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.280
Does she notice I have the bow?

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.280
No, I notice she doesn't have it, I promise.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.400
I have the soap.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.000
Wait, this is a bathroom and...

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.120
This is a garden, it's a bathroom!

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.720
Uh, no!

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.400
This isn't a bathtub, lady.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.960
This isn't a lifeguard's seat.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.600
Aw, no, that's not the meme, why is it?

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.040
This is a bathtub.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.360
This isn't a beach, it's a bathtub!

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.640
Yes, yes, that's it!

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.280
What's in the drawer?

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.280
Oh, sorry about that.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.040
Oh, chap, didn't really mean to do that, but hey, hold on, we're here now.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.200
I love causing problems on purpose.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.760
Whomp, whomp.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.720
Whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp, whomp.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.240
I don't...

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.120
I assume I can put it on you, essentially.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.000
But...

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.680
What a bizarre...

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.080
Come here, come here.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.760
I can put it on you?

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.280
I thought I could put it on you.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.200
Oh, I'm just joined it from you.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.440
Oh, we're just passing it mathematically, excuse me.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.880
Oh, we're just like, here you go, no, you have it, no, you have it, no, you have it.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.760
You hang up, you hang up, you hang up.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.480
Uh, I don't know how to get her to break this.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.320
Um, no, she's always gonna have it.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.320
She goes to an idol meeting in the open, literally.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.280
How, what is, maybe we go in another garden for now.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.080
Wait, can we even get out of here?

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.920
Wait, we can't even get out until we progress through this stage?

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.960
Our section?

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.480
There is a gate here.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.320
Hello, Mr. Gate.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.400
That is not going to work.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.120
Can we put this on you?

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.160
We have...

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.520
I don't know if you can.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.240
I like the way we both look down at it.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:16.120
We're like, hmm, hmm, that's not the way it should be.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.360
Okay, why can I not put it on you?

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:25.440
Oh, oh, oh, you're so aggressive.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.240
No, I'm like trying so hard to put it on you right now.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:35.760
Maybe, oh, wait, wait, wait, oh, maybe if I move the duck, if we move the geese.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.400
And you be the duck?

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.440
Yeah, and I'll be the, I'll be the inch.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.120
Oh, I like this idea.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.320
And then I stand there and then she puts it on me.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.240
Unless you're going to constantly put it.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.240
Okay, right, I'll let her pick that up.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:59.520
And then I'm going to yank this away.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.640
No, you don't care about this.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.680
Okay, look, it's hidden.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.480
No, I just clicked off the game and you stopped doing that.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:10.760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, grab the ribbon, grab the ribbon.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.520
Where is it?

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.080
I'm trying.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.520
Oh, no, you've got me, lady.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.360
Wait, does she know that?

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.680
Yeah.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.160
She knew.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.600
That was.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.640
I want the ribbon.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.440
Wait, what?

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.280
How does she know that's not possible?

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.080
What is on me?

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.320
Fine.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.640
But the game literally says to put her there.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.880
The table we broke, something about the table we broke.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.680
Hold on, what's up with the table?

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.280
We're looking at our table now.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.640
This one.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.880
Oh, it's how we get out.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.360
We go up the table now to go into another garden.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:53.760
Oh, OK.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.600
You're going to move on to the next one and we can come back to this.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:02.840
We'll come back to the garden as soon as we share the mister.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.000
We call her Miss Crackpot because we have to crack her pot.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Hi.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.720
Do you have a cup of tea by any chance for us little geeseling?

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.440
We really like your lacrosse.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.440
We do.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.560
Do you want to have some tea, a bit of tea?

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.760
No, no tea.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.560
OK, jeez.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.000
It's hard to impress these people, clearly.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.360
Does he have a sip of tea, maybe?

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:34.320
Come on, let's watch him.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:34.800
Hello.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.240
Hello?

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.800
He doesn't.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.560
He really looking at us like, can I help you?

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.360
Yeah, actually, you're a mission objective.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.200
We're not doing it.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.280
We're not up to no good.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.880
No.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.720
I'm just I'm just crouching around in your garden.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.320
I ain't doing nothing.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.800
We're doing what we watched.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.040
We're watched through the fence.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.880
He can't see us, but we can see him.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.400
We're we're such we're such bad geese.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.960
Literally.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.080
What is going on?

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:10.720
Night night.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.000
Wait, why is he so?

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.760
Why is he so suspicious?

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.520
But yeah, he's paranoid.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.840
He like can't even enjoy his tea.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.480
Come on, drink your tea, sir.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.320
He's rubbing his knees.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.320
Rubbing his knees.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.320
Yeah.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.920
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.560
No, you're supposed to spell it, my good sir.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.600
Did I not give you a fright doing that?

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.600
All right, take a sip.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.160
Take it.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.920
Hey.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.040
Wait, that was what we wanted?

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.960
Wait, we wanted him to spit out the tea,

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.040
so he has to drink the whole thing, I think.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:56.960
Was that not it?

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.840
No.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.000
Steal his shoes.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.360
Don't have to tell me to it.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.280
Hi.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.800
Oh, no, I didn't mean to do that.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.360
I meant to steal your loafers, sir.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:07.720
Sorry.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.880
Yeah, I'm geeny, damn loafers.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.960
Go sit down, sir.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.600
Go sit down.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.560
I want your shoes.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:15.760
Oh, sorry.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.760
Oh, he didn't like that.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.720
Look at him.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.960
He's taller.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.040
Like, he's taller-y in us, but he's kind of not.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.040
Uh, what?

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.040
No.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.040
Oh, no, I missed my turn.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.040
There, can't get enough, can you?

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.040
Sucker.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.040
No, run.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.040
Yeah.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.040
Out of bounds.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.040
That's right.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.040
You aren't coded to come over here.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.040
Only I'm coded to come over here, but you?

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.040
No.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.040
Oh, did he just boot me because I took his shoe?

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.040
You don't deserve it.

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.040
Maybe use the big bell behind him.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.040
Oh!

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:02.040
That makes perfect sense, actually, to do the bell when he goes for a sip.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:05.040
Can we see him do a sip from that side?

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.040
One of us has to go on the other side, I think.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:13.040
I think we, uh, I think we both have to do it or else we can, and...

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.040
We're back!

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.040
America Kayo, hello!

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.040
There he is.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.040
Excuse me, madam.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.040
I need the bell.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.040
You're in my way, madam.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:27.040
Madam, please refrain from getting in my way.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.040
Right.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040
Oh, sorry.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.040
Okay, that's definitely what you're supposed to do when he sips his tea.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:38.040
We just need to hang around while he does his tea.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.040
Okay, we're getting there.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.040
We just need our handheld through the game.

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.040
Just a tiny bit.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.040
Okay, just a tiny bit of hand-holding.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.040
Right, so we need to wait until he's suspicious.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.040
This is over.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.040
He shouldn't.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:58.040
He should drink his tea after he's done his, like, suspicious animation.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.040
Oh, I'm trapped.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.040
I'm trapped.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.040
We're good.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.040
I didn't...

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.040
This game is a lot harder than I thought.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.040
I thought this was like a...

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040
I say this about every game I play.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.040
Oh, I thought this was a child's game.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.040
Why is it hard?

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.040
Right, we're like, why is it hard?

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.040
Right, we're like, why is it hard?

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.040
Right, we're like, why is it hard?

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.040
Why is it...

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.040
No, the bell thing needs to be set up again.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.040
She's not fixing it.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.040
Oh, no.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.040
You're right.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.040
Oh, sugar.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.040
What is she trying to fix right now?

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.040
She's currently painting.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.040
I don't know.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.040
I can take her painting brush.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.040
Oh, I can draw her painting brush, one or the other.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.040
Oh, wow.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.040
Good night, Straniaga.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.040
I'll wake up in four hours, bro.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040
You are going to be shattered.

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.040
Um, no.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.040
Was I supposed to take the paper?

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.040
Oh, she's going to fix the bell.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.040
Okay.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.040
And then...

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.040
Do you want to put the duck in the other garden?

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.040
I wonder if that's what it is.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.040
You put the statue in the other garden,

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.040
so then she forgets she even had a duck.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.040
No.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.040
No, no, no, no.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.040
I must tell you...

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.040
Okay, there we go.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.040
Oh, yeah.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040
Okay, it's now out of bounds,

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.040
so she can't ask for the duck anymore.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.040
It doesn't work like that.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.040
And now we wait for him to drink his dang tea

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:34.040
that must be frozen solids at this stage.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.040
Because there's no way.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.040
Please ask for tea.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.040
Are you coming in this garden?

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.040
Yeah.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.040
Your audio may be cutting out from me

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.040
on Discord a little bit.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.040
Oh, sorry.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.040
No, that was all good, the knee already.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.040
So she knows it's fake, right?

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.040
She tells you to move.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.040
Do I need to paint you?

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.040
So she's fixing that.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.040
Wait, can I put the bull on you now

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.040
because we got rid of the statue?

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:13.040
No, I've done...

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.040
You didn't give me time.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.040
Right, go paint.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.040
Whoa!

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.040
Right, go paint.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.040
Jeez.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.040
Let's do this bail.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.040
I want some bourbon.

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.040
This German.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.040
Oh, he's about to do his animation.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.040
Okay.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040
No, no, no, wait.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.040
No!

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.040
He was supposed to do the drink tea animation.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.040
Why?

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.040
Maybe this will help your mindset for the puzzle.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.040
The game is meant to single player.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.040
Everything can be done solo.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.040
You mean we could be doing this twice as fast

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.040
but it's taken us three times as long?

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.040
Hold on a minute.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.040
What's going on here?

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.040
These allegations.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.040
Are you calling us dumb?

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.040
Why?

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.040
Because you're right.

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.040
Cush me.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.040
Yeah, I mean, it's not.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:53.040
Wait, water in this dish maybe?

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.040
I'm like trying to look around for hints,

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.040
but I'm like, bruv.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.040
Stand on the stand when she's not looking.

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.040
Right, if Mercy's distracting her.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.040
Okay, I've stood on the stand.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.040
While she's not looking, I am doing no input.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:18.040
As if that was it.

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.040
That took us so long to get the first thing.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.040
Right, he's got tea in his hand.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.040
I need to ring the bell.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.040
Look at me.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.040
I'm Mercy.

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.040
I have a bow.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.040
Ready?

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.040
Yes!

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.040
Oh my God.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.040
That's fantastic.

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.040
It took us so long to get one and now we have two.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.040
Oh, now you have such a cool ribbon on you.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.040
I know.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.040
I have a bow like you now.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.040
The soap.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.040
What do we do with the soap?

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.040
Why do you have soap outside?

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.040
Well, she has like a bathtub and a toilet.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.040
Quite literally is her decorative stuff.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.040
Hold on.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.040
Let me check where our objectives are

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.040
because I've completely forgotten that.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040
Oh, sorry, that's not objectives.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.040
Make the man go barefoot and do the washing

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.040
with a bra, a pair of socks, slippers and a bar soap.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.040
Right, hold on a minute.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.040
Where would we do washing?

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.040
Right, I'm going to steal this guy's other loafer.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.040
But where do we get water to do the washing?

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.040
Let's steal his shoe because that's super easy.

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.040
Hello, we would like to steal your shoe, please.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.040
We do the washing in here.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.040
No, it's not what it looks like.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.040
We're not here for your other loafer at all, I promise.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040
I promise.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.040
You can't get me.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.040
Out of bounds.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.040
Out of bounds.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.040
Talk to the game devs because the face ain't listening.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.040
Okay.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.040
Oh, he won't let me in again.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.040
Right, okay.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.040
Well, go sit back down.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.040
Because now we need to do laundry.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.040
I don't really know where to do laundry.

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.040
Put the vase on the man's side of the garden.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.040
The man will throw it back over.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.040
Oh, we're just straight up getting spoiled.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.040
Are you okay if we get our hand held?

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.040
Because I don't mind the wreaths and spoiling it for me.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.040
Okay, we need to drag the purple statue all the way over.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.040
We're back.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.040
We can do it.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040
Don't mind me.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040
I'm strapped.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.040
I'm not that fast, lady.

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.040
There you go.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.040
I'm stuck on the fence.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.040
Let me over.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040
Okay, we did it.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040
Yay.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.040
Hello, would you like to throw this magnificent priceless vase over the fence by any chance?

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040
Or vase vase?

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.040
I don't know.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.040
Vase?

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.040
Like Vaseline?

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.040
He actually did.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.040
Oh, he's going to go the other way.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.040
Wait, why are you taking me?

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.040
He just stripped me naked.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.040
Give me back.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.040
I'm naked.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.040
I feel so humiliated.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.040
Oh, I guess we do the washing in here.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.040
Oh, okay.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.040
Because look, there's water.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.040
Oh my God, we're swimming.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.040
Wait, we need to grab the bar.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.040
We need the bra and the sockies.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.040
Can I quickly grab it this way?

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.040
Maybe I can run.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.040
No, no.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.040
Let's do it this way.

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.040
If she catches me, it's fine because at least you've got...

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.040
Wait, she's not even upset about the...

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.040
Okay, we're doing it.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.040
We're doing it.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.040
We're doing it.

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.040
We're doing it.

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.040
Turns out all we needed was someone to spell it out for us.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.040
Wait, no, he's not going to throw that back over.

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040
It's in the water now.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.040
No, this is mine.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.040
It's in the water.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.040
No, no, no, no, no.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.040
Don't do something.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.040
Give me that.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.040
It's going in the water for washes.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.040
Yeah, that's right.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.040
You don't want to stand in this.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.040
No, these are mine.

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.040
There are many things.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.040
No, go have your tea.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.040
Why aren't you drinking tea a moment ago?

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.040
Go forget.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.040
Forget?

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.040
No, no, no, no.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.040
Hold on.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.040
No.

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.040
Leave Mercy be, you fellow wench.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.040
Harlan!

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.040
Yes, please listen to my problems.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.040
Suzuki, life is so hard as a ghost.

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.040
You see, people don't...

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.040
Oh, well, you are.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040
As long as one of us picks up, that's the main thing.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.040
Grab it.

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.040
I'm away.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.040
I'm away.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040
I'm away.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.040
I'm away.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.040
I'm away.

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.040
I'll grab her stuff.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.040
No, no, no, no.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:49.040
Stop what it looks like.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040
I promise it's not.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.040
Right, hold on.

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.040
There.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.040
I know your neighbor's with that again.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.040
Ah.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.040
Take this sock.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.040
Can you pick up that bar of soap?

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.040
That's on the bathtub?

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040
Yeah.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.040
And then we...

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.040
I think we're done.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.040
I think we've done it.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040
Yeah.

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.040
Taking the clothes.

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:09.040
Right, as long as the guy doesn't take a random pair of socks off of us,

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.040
I don't know why he would care that much,

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040
but I don't know where he is.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.040
And the camera isn't zoomed out,

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.040
so I don't know if I'm going to run into him.

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.040
Is he still...

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.040
Oh, he's moved the bra out of the freaking thing.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.040
Right, let me go get that bra.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.040
Do not throw that bra over the fence.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.040
Do you understand me?

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.040
Give me that bra.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.040
Give me that bra to me.

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.040
I need that.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.040
I need my training bra, okay?

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.040
We're doing laundry.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.040
Is this what I'm supposed to do?

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.040
La, la, la, la, la.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.040
Wait, this wasn't what I was supposed to do.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.040
What is...

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.040
Do the washing.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.040
A slipper!

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.040
Oh, no, I'll put all the slippers out of bounds.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040
Oh, no, I'm backfired.

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.040
My plan has backfired terrifically.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.040
Hold on.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.040
Hold the line, Mercy.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.040
Hold the line.

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.040
I'm coming, Mercy.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.040
Distract him.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.040
No, no, no, no.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.040
Oh, hold the line.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.040
Hold the line.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040
Hold the line.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040
I'm coming.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.040
I'm coming.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.040
Oh, hold the line.

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.040
Oh, I'm running.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.040
I'm running.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.040
I'm running.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.040
I'm running.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.040
I'm running.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.040
I'm running.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.040
Oh!

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.040
Yes!

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.040
Yay!

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.040
We did it!

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.040
That was frickin' hard.

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:21.040
You didn't make it so hard.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.040
God, that camera is so hard.

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.040
To-do list.

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:26.040
Make someone print...

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040
The prize, right?

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.040
The prize.

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.040
I mean, it looks like he wants to do it.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.040
I'm not really wanting to, like, make him do anything.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.040
What is he writing?

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:38.040
Does that mean he just, like, honk when he's, you know...

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.040
Oh, he hit me.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.040
Did he make a no-geese sign?

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.040
I think everyone's...

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:47.040
Yeah, literally everyone's doing a no-geese every time we're finished in an area.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.040
Okay, do this.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.040
Right, he can touch the brand stuff.

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.040
It doesn't matter.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.040
How do we...

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.040
Is there any gardening equipment?

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.040
Oh, yeah.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.040
Oh, yeah.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.040
You just closed it on my face, lady.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.040
Don't do that again.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.040
That made myself clear.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.040
Is there gardening tools in here?

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.040
Hello, lady.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.040
Do you have a...

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.040
The shears?

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.040
Oh!

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.040
I see it.

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.040
And I'm messing it up terribly.

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.040
Oh, this is quite heavy.

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.040
I have to...

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.040
Hold on, lady.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.040
Hold on, lady.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.040
Give me that.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.040
See this paint?

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.040
Man, I'm terrible at this game.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.040
You know that.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.040
Can you grab those clippers?

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.040
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.040
Excuse me.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.040
Have you ever heard about our savior, Goose McGooseface?

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.040
Very good Goose.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:31.040
One of the best Goose that lived for seven years, which is so big in Goose life.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.040
It is...

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.040
Thank you for listening to my story.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:38.040
Is that how you print a rose bush?

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:42.040
Well, we're giving them...

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.040
We...

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.040
Do we need to...

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.040
Oh, I need to move it.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.040
Oh, yeah.

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.040
Huh?

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:55.040
That didn't do anything.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.040
Do we need...

01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:00.040
Is there a rose bush we need to, like, steal from her garden?

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:05.040
Grab the rose pot and drag it next to the shrub, then mess up the shrub.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.040
Mess up the shrub.

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.040
Excuse me, lady.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.040
You need to come back in your garden.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.040
Man, fuck the shrub.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.040
Fuck the shrub.

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.040
Fuck the shrub.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.040
Fuck the shrub.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.040
You know that Nicki Minaj song that's like, hi heels on Nicki?

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.040
Wait, wait, wait.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.040
And it goes, fuck the club.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.040
Fuck the...

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.040
Yeah, fuck the shrub.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.040
Is that all?

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.040
I mean, I'm going for it.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.040
Wait, he threw the things...

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.040
Wait, is she going to accidentally chop off the rose?

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.040
Yeah, looks like she is.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:40.040
Uh...

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:45.040
She hid it behind her back.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:46.040
Oh, no.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.040
Do you know how long it takes to make roses?

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:54.040
It's like a very hard job to have them grow successfully.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.040
It takes so long.

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.040
Right, okay, let's see.

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.040
We caused a...

01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.040
We caused a problem.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.040
Oh, no, he's...

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.040
Is he crying?

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.040
He said my rose.

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:07.040
He shits the rose, revenge.

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.040
Right, how do we get out of here?

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.040
Oh, what's she doing?

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.040
She's opening a panel.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.040
She's letting us go out this panel here.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:18.040
She said I had enough of you, geese.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.040
Sorry, are we in the way?

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.040
Pardon me, lady.

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:24.040
I don't know what your plan is.

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.040
Oh, she got no geese as well.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.040
Okay, I actually kind of like that when you're finished with this section,

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.040
the game's like no goose, by the way.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.040
No geese.

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.040
Okay, okay, I'm out.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.040
I'm out.

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.040
Jeez, I'm done.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.040
Yay.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.040
Okay, bye.

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.040
Thank you, lady.

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.040
What's in here?

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.040
Hello.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:42.040
Oh, pardon...

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.040
Oh, sorry, I'm just here to bring...

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.040
Oh, we're just coming through.

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.040
Sorry, just visiting.

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.040
Oh, package.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.040
Thank you.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.040
Whose package is this?

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.040
Can we open it?

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.040
We can take it away with us.

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:59.040
We actually don't have an objective, so we're not there yet.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.040
Is this the wrong way?

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.040
I like to steal people's mail.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.040
I'm a porch pirate.

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.040
Look at me.

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.040
Yarg.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.040
Yarg.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.040
I'm going to post it in the wrong door on purpose.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.040
I'm going to put this one on the other person's door.

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.040
And then they get to talk and then they'll fall in love or something.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040
Yeah, well, we're so good.

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.040
We're such good neighbors.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.040
Okay, I literally...

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040
We need geese everywhere.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.040
Geese are actually secretly keepers.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.040
You're so helpful.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.040
We're writing fan fiction.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.040
Look at the lavender.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.040
Pretty flowers.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.040
We love flowers in this house.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:40.040
You're the prettiest flower I've ever seen.

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.040
Oh, it's juff.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.040
I'm blushing.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:48.040
Oh, the camera angle is swapping every two seconds.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.040
Oh my God, there's a Benki!

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.040
AC is in this game!

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.040
Not this!

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.040
Look at the Benki!

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.040
It's for AC!

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.040
Oh my God, it's for Benki!

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.040
Wait, AC needs to play this game now just so she can walk around.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.040
Look, you're so cute now.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.040
Wait, how do I do AC's voice again?

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.040
On today, we're going to play Goose Game with Mercy.

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:17.040
Thank you, OGSans, for watching me and my kohai, Mercy and the snippets.

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.040
This is a terrible voice.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.040
I cannot do AC at all.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.040
I'm trying, okay?

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.040
I can't do AC.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.040
AC is too unique and too cute.

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:29.040
Can't do it like a European accent?

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.040
Is it too hard to mimic European accents?

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.040
Of any kind.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.040
Can you do French?

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:36.040
Did you learn French because you know,

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:38.040
I didn't really learn French.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:41.040
Bonjour, salut.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.040
Like that kind of French.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.040
Oh, I've not heard your French voice!

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.040
I've not heard your French voice before!

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:51.040
Salut, merci, ça va?

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.040
Ça va bien.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.040
Wow, your French voice is so cute!

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.040
To jouer avec moi, on...

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.040
Oh, we're at the meeting again!

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.040
Look, it's the rake!

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:10.040
Wait, are we done?

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.040
Did we finish already?

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.040
No, we couldn't have.

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.040
No, we've not.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.040
Help the woman dress up the boss.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:27.040
Oh no, did we...

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.040
Wait, no, but she let us go to the next area, so...

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.040
Are we finished?

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.040
Oh no!

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.040
Oh, it makes the ground keepers wear his own hat.

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.040
We don't have that.

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:44.040
But we're allowed to move on?

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.040
How do we make...

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.040
You accidentally went back to the beginning of the game.

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.040
Wait, so we need to go the other way to unlock the new map?

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:55.040
Hold on, Ray, let's try the other...

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.040
Only we would manage that, honestly.

01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.040
Ray, let's try that again.

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.040
Let's try that again, Ray.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.040
We'll go upstream this time.

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.040
It was the French, I'll burn the French this time.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:09.040
I don't know where the fuck we is.

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:12.040
Wait, do we need to go along that bridge there?

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.040
No, maybe.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.040
I'm swimming up the water.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.040
To say water in French, you say...

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.040
L'eau.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.040
Why is the French...

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.040
Why is water male in French?

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:28.040
I do not know.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.040
No.

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.040
Can we eat?

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.040
No.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.040
I'm skinny buying that skinny, you know what I'm saying?

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.040
You think where it matters.

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.040
That's what I like to hear.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.040
Wait, so...

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:46.040
We're casually just flirting.

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.040
I remember seeing complaints like...

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:53.040
On feature group collabs, I was just turned into them being nice to each other.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.040
What, you're surprised?

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:56.040
You're surprised that we're nice?

01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:58.040
What do you want me mean?

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.040
Yeah, literally Scots?

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.040
What do you want me to be like?

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.040
Oh, you Canadians with your cube costs and all that,

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.040
and your fake French, like what?

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:11.040
Wait, so we weren't supposed to go here or...

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.040
I thought this was a nice area to go to.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.040
What's the deal?

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:18.040
This was the way to go, because we opened a gate to get here,

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.040
and there was a new camera angle.

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.040
Oh, well, I guess we should move this way now.

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:25.040
Moving on up?

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.040
Maybe it was like a shortcut to go back, I guess?

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040
A bit of Bologna.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.040
Okay, well, considering...

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.040
Yeah, there's literally an arrow that's like...

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:36.040
You're actually meant to go this way, dumbass.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.040
Oh, hey, a car.

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.040
Let's trap someone in it.

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.040
Oh.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.040
So this is how Mercy lured her first victim.

01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:51.040
This is how I heard my first victim, right, Senpai?

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:55.040
I put in, like, hot girls in your area in this truck,

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.040
and you just walked in.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.040
I can't believe you guys actually responded to that ad.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.040
She put up cute Yandere in your area,

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.040
seeking you now two miles away.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:07.040
She's honing in on your current location.

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.040
Wait a minute.

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.040
Whatever objectives.

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.040
Get into the pub.

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.040
Break the dartboard.

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.040
Get the toy boat.

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.040
Can you say toy boat ten times?

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:21.040
Fast?

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.040
Toy boat?

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.040
Why?

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.040
Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.040
Wait, why does it sound like something's on there?

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.040
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.040
Toy boat, hey, how do you say toy boat?

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.040
Toy boat.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.040
Toy boat.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.040
Toy boat.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.040
Toy boat.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.040
Toy boat, toy boat.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.040
Bit of a toy boat moment.

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.040
Bit of a toy boat.

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.040
Like when you say, like, tin soldier or something,

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.040
and then you're supposed to say it like ten times fast or something.

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.040
Tin soldier? I've never heard tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier.

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:04.040
Oh, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier, tin soldier.

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:06.040
Okay, okay, I've not heard that one.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.040
I heard like Peter Piper picked a pick.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.040
Can you get his shoes? I want your shoes.

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.040
Oh, go for his laces.

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.040
Get him where it hurts.

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.040
Give me that.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.040
Yeah.

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.040
We're terrorizing him.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.040
Oh, I can't.

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:26.040
This camera angle is so unforgiven.

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.040
It really is.

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.040
No, I keep getting pushed away.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:34.040
Do we need to jump in the van and scare them?

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.040
Jump in the box, maybe.

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:38.040
You're right.

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:40.040
There should be another box in the van.

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.040
Let's go into your secret kidnap van.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.040
Wait, how do we...

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.040
We get in the...

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:48.040
How do I...

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.040
How do you...

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.040
Okay, wait.

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:54.040
Oh, no.

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.040
It's only one at a time, right?

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.040
You go in before me.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.040
I'll be fine.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.040
You go in without me.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:04.040
It's okay. We'll cause trouble with leaders.

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:06.040
Yes, I think if you burst out of the box, maybe.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.040
One of you hide in the box when the woman isn't looking,

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.040
close the box and wait until the delivery woman picks up the box,

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.040
she will carry you inside the pub.

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.040
What about me? I'll just stay outside.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.040
I'm literally waiting in line for a queue.

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.040
I'm pretty sure people have to queue for nightclubs or something like that.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.040
I'm queuing to get in the pub right now.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.040
I've been to clubs a few times,

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.040
and I'm just like,

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.040
that's loud music.

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.040
It's not for me, mate.

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.040
Oh!

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.040
I got these Tism earphones

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.040
where you put in and it makes everything quieter when you go outside.

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.040
If you do not have them, they are so good.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.040
I cannot recommend them enough.

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.040
I will literally send you a pair.

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:48.040
It makes going outside a heck of a lot easier.

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:50.040
Oh!

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.040
Yes.

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.040
Be careful. That's goods in there.

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.040
That's very valuable goods.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.040
Do I make myself clear?

01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.040
Do I make myself clear?

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:04.040
Okay.

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.040
There should be another box.

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.040
Am I going to...

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:10.040
Is the camera going to thingy out?

01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:12.040
Oh no.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.040
Can you see yourself?

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.040
I can't move. I'm stuck.

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.040
I'm stuck too.

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.040
Did the game devs...

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.040
Game devs? Hello game devs?

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.040
Any game devs?

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:28.040
Any hotpatch? Any game dev fixers?

01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:34.040
That is not good.

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.040
I'm not sure.

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.040
I think we might have softlocked ourselves a little bit.

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.040
I'm not...

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:42.040
I'm stuck.

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.040
I'm stuck.

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.040
Game bro! Game bro!

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:48.040
I'm in! I'm in!

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.040
That wasn't very nice of me. Where are you?

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.040
I don't know.

01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.040
Oh no!

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:56.040
Where's the grid?

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:00.040
Mild panic.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.040
How on earth do I get to you?

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.040
There's a hole in here.

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.040
Yeah. What do you call me?

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:08.040
Oh where is it?

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.040
I'm reunited.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.040
It feels so good.

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.040
Yunk yunk.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.040
Yunk yunk.

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.040
Yunk yunk.

01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.040
Okay let's destroy that dartboard.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.040
Oh yeah! Actually we need to play...

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.040
Bullseye!

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.040
190!

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.040
Oh no no! We're just...

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.040
We're niceki's.

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.040
We're niceki's.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.040
We're niceki's I promise.

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.040
We're not... Oh we have little...

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.040
Game...

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:40.040
All the toss the ring stuff.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.040
Oh sorry. Were you playing that?

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.040
Oh sorry. Were you playing?

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:46.040
Yeah I think I...

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:48.040
Oh that's the dart!

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.040
That scream out on when he...

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:52.040
One, two, three!

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:54.040
Oh.

01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.040
I'm sorry for distracting you, Gitzer.

01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:58.040
How do we destroy that?

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:04.040
Oh no I'm sorry!

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.040
I get to play all harmonica!

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.040
Hmm.

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:12.040
Hmm.

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.040
How do we destroy a dartboard between us?

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:16.040
Maybe cigarette?

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.040
Maybe we've got something similar?

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:20.040
Maybe we've got something similar?

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:22.040
Hmm.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.040
Yeah.

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.040
Oh! There's like a little podium!

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.040
I knight myself the geese of old...

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:34.040
Is it a podium?

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.040
Are they clapping for me?

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.040
Hello?

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.040
How do you open your wings?

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.040
I don't know.

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.040
Oh my god!

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.040
They love us!

01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:50.040
Oh my god!

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:52.040
I was joking about this being a podium!

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.040
But we actually got a flower!

01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:56.040
That's so cute!

01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:58.040
Oh my god we're such good kids!

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.040
We should join a circus.

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:02.040
Yes we should join a circus.

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.040
What?

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.040
Oh that's so cute.

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.040
Okay maybe geese girl considered for Gen 2

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:10.040
because of how adorable these are.

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.040
I'm starting to warm up to anyone...

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.040
Suggestion to a wasp girl.

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:16.040
A what?

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:18.040
Oh see bug girls are an issue

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:20.040
and I'll tell you why I actually developed

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.040
mental, I don't mind telling you this.

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.040
Oh really?

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:26.040
Because of arachnophobia for example

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.040
or insectphobia is a very real thing.

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.040
It has a possibility

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:32.040
of putting the girl at a disadvantage.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:34.040
Design wise.

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:36.040
Yeah!

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:38.040
If you didn't know

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.040
I don't mind sharing this with you.

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.040
But you know how you have...

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:46.040
Oh that's nice.

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:52.040
Oh that's it?

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:54.040
That's it no more?

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.040
Oh my god give them the flower!

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.040
You were amazing!

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.040
Oh I can't give them the flower

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.040
he doesn't like it.

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.040
You were amazing sir!

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.040
You wanna play again?

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.040
Mister?

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:10.040
No he just wants to look at us.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.040
That's fine.

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.040
So you know how you have

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.040
two eyeballs?

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.040
Yeah.

01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:20.040
I made sure

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:22.040
you had two eyeballs because

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.040
it's actually really startling

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.040
if a vtuber only has

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:28.040
one eye or is like a mono eye

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.040
monster girl type thing.

01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:32.040
It's kind of one of the

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:34.040
rules of like

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.040
development is you can't

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.040
wait can she see me under the table?

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.040
You must have a girl

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:42.040
with two eyes that isn't too freaky

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.040
or you're putting them at a severe disadvantage.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.040
It kind of goes the same

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:48.040
for vtubers that might have

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:50.040
multiple eye designs.

01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:52.040
It's

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:54.040
unfortunately just like

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.040
a weird unwritten rule you're not supposed to do it.

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.040
What is going on over here?

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.040
Are we doing the dishes?

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:02.040
Oh it's the balls!

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.040
Oh it's the toy!

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.040
Ah! Hide under table!

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:08.040
Hide under table! Oh no there's no table over here!

01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.040
Leave us alone!

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:12.040
Leave me alone I'm scared!

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:14.040
I'm just a little guy

01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:16.040
who wants a knife!

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.040
Hold on I want this knife.

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:20.040
Hold on let me go on.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.040
Oh wow she's like chasing me all the way out.

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.040
Chase me under the table good luck with that.

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:28.040
You look very menacing with

01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:30.040
a knife in your mouth!

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.040
Oh the knife is underneath you I think.

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.040
What am I to do with a knife?

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.040
I don't know I felt like maybe we can destroy

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.040
the dartboard with the knife.

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.040
Break the dartboard get the toy boat

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.040
make the old man fall on his bottom

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:46.040
steal a pint glass

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:48.040
and drop it in a canal

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:50.040
and set the table knife fork plate

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.040
Oh.

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:54.040
Set what table?

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:56.040
I'm like proper stuck.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:58.040
Oh what's this?

01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:00.040
I'm currently getting gridlocked

01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.040
mildly gridlocked.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:04.040
Where are we supposed to set up a table?

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:06.040
I don't know.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.040
Oh there's like a little underway pathway here.

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.040
I mean a bug girl doesn't need

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:12.040
multiple eyes.

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.040
It's kind of hard to like

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.040
Oh my god I'm like

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.040
Sorry Mercy's currently fighting

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:20.040
the owner and I'm like under here like

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:22.040
Well actually when it comes to the designs

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:24.040
and intricateness of having to produce

01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:26.040
Emma. Oh no don't shim me I was saying.

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:28.040
You can't get me when I'm under

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:30.040
the dock.

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.040
Continue.

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:38.040
What table

01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:40.040
are we supposed to set up?

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.040
Wait we're meant to make him fall

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.040
on his bottom. Oh when he goes

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:46.040
to play the harmonic we need to move

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.040
the chair out of the way.

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.040
Oh that's sad.

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:52.040
I don't know I know he seems a bit too old

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.040
for this.

01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:56.040
Yeah he's literally already says oh my back hurts.

01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:58.040
How do we break

01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:00.040
a dart board truly?

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.040
Maybe we take a knife and then

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.040
he throws the knife instead.

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:06.040
Is this one supposed to do it?

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.040
No he notices as soon as

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.040
I take it.

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:12.040
Right so then what's the table we

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.040
can you pick up the dart?

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.040
You can.

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.040
Bunk.

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:24.040
Bunk.

01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:26.040
I don't

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.040
I don't know.

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.040
I wanted to play too sir.

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:32.040
What the deal is

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.040
reeflings you're going to have to

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.040
hold my hand I don't know what we're

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.040
doing.

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.040
Oh no no no it's all good

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.040
it's all good.

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.040
Uh

01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:46.040
this is Scalera

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:48.040
lens type thing.

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.040
So when he goes to play the harmonica

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:54.040
so basically we have to watch him play

01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.040
darts and then he grabs the harmonica.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:58.040
The table is in the back of the pub

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:00.040
where Mercy got stuck at.

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:02.040
We need to set a table whilst that person

01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:04.040
chases us around.

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:06.040
That's severe.

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.040
Biblically accurate

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.040
Vita for Angel that's actually quite funny.

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:14.040
Yeah

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.040
well you you didn't get a bullseye

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:18.040
but that's okay.

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.040
Move out of the way.

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:24.040
I wasn't doing anything.

01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.040
I wasn't doing anything.

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.040
Yeah yeah.

01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.040
Oh

01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.040
I feel so bad now.

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.040
Okay he actually recovered from

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:40.040
Oh no he didn't.

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:42.040
No we're sorry.

01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.040
I wasn't really

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.040
at our attention but we got it done.

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:48.040
Right we need to set a table

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.040
up here.

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.040
I'm setting a table.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.040
Table table table. What table?

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.040
Table. This table?

01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:58.040
That table.

01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:00.040
The table that

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.040
Mercy got stuck at.

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:04.040
This one? Why yes.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.040
I am aware of a table Mercy got stuck

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.040
at. This one? Surely.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.040
I don't

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.040
I don't see any.

01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:14.040
The candlestick one.

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.040
I've been able to pick up the candlestick though.

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.040
You can't do that with this.

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:24.040
I don't

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.040
leave me alone. I'm just a little goose

01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:28.040
in a human world.

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:30.040
Not there.

01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:32.040
It is back lift.

01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:36.040
Follow the path under the deck

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.040
to get to the back.

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.040
Wait

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:42.040
where Mercy got taken and I couldn't reach?

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.040
Oh

01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.040
Oh my god.

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.040
Okay.

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.040
Let's get these items.

01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:52.040
Let's get these items.

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.040
You're chasing me out.

01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:56.040
Yes shoot shoot. We're out of the cafe.

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:58.040
Go away and go do

01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:00.040
your cafe stuff.

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:02.040
Exactly. I'm going to grab some stuff.

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:04.040
I'm going to grab anything I can.

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:06.040
I got the cup for the table.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:08.040
Are you going to grab something too?

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:10.040
Are you feeling risky?

01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:12.040
Are you feeling risky?

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.040
I'm going to get chased out.

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:16.040
I broke it.

01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:18.040
Oopsies.

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:20.040
Don't chase me out. I need to pick up an item

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:22.040
for the table.

01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:24.040
That's right. I'm hiding under the table.

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.040
I'm off camera.

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:28.040
I'm out. Sorry.

01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:30.040
It's fine. Pick up that candle.

01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:32.040
You can pick up that candlestick I think.

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:34.040
I want to get the candlestick

01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:36.040
but I'm stuck now.

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:38.040
I'm stuck as well.

01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:40.040
This freaking video.

01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:42.040
The distance thing.

01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.040
Oh my god. I'm getting

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.040
pushed out by the guard as well.

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.040
Ring the guards.

01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:50.040
This is the best I can do. Literally be right under you.

01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.040
They did not make this game easy.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.040
We're two players.

01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.040
Sorry.

01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:00.040
Stop chasing me.

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:02.040
How is he chasing you out like this?

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:04.040
We're literally

01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:06.040
all the way inside the restaurant.

01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:08.040
Did the old man

01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:10.040
tell them?

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:12.040
No. Stop looking at me.

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:14.040
He is

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:16.040
honing in on you. Can you come under the deck?

01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:18.040
I'm going to try to come under the deck.

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:20.040
No.

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:22.040
Okay. You're safe.

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:24.040
He should go away. Yeah. He said,

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.040
oh. Rassen for Rassen.

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:28.040
And he's going to go get a beer.

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:32.040
No.

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:34.040
He instantly locks on you.

01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.040
How did he know?

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:38.040
That doesn't seem right.

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.040
That seems too difficult.

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.040
Follow the...

01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:44.040
He's so persistent.

01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:46.040
Poor man can't catch a break.

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.040
Wait. He's looking for his glass but I broke it.

01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:52.040
Wait. There's now two people in the cafe area.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.040
We need

01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:56.040
so much stuff from it.

01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.040
Hi.

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.040
Does he give up?

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.040
I hope he gives up. Damn.

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.040
Yeah. Is there anything we can do on this side?

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:06.040
I don't think so. I can see the goose sign

01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:08.040
here. They're going to move it right here.

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.040
This sign right here. That's the no goose sign.

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:12.040
I can tell. I have gamer instinct.

01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:14.040
There's a plate over here.

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:16.040
Wait. There's already a plate here?

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.040
There is.

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.040
Okay. We'll take that and then

01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:22.040
we'll start getting it set up. Is there anything else

01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.040
I can grab? What's this?

01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:26.040
That's a bucket.

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.040
Wait.

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:30.040
I hope I don't break it.

01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.040
No. I don't... Yeah.

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:34.040
Yeah.

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.040
It's so painy.

01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:38.040
What?

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:40.040
Oh, my face.

01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.040
My face! Ow!

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:44.040
My little goose neck just got

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:46.040
snapped in half. I can't believe he closed down

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:48.040
your face.

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:50.040
So red.

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:52.040
So what is...

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.040
We're like...

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.040
How do you describe the dart bird?

01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:58.040
I am...

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.040
Right. I'm going to get the salt shaker.

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.040
Yeah. Get the salt shaker.

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:04.040
Give me this. Give me this.

01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:06.040
Okay. I said give me this.

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:08.040
There we go. Right. And then I'll go on to the table

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.040
with you and then I'll go down the steps

01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.040
and then I can put it on the little table thing.

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.040
And then that's one more. I am ticked off

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:16.040
of this. Yeah. Jeez. She is

01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:18.040
feral for us right now.

01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:20.040
I'm following. I'm following.

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.040
Is there emotion sickness levels

01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:24.040
question mark? Oh, bad.

01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:26.040
Because the camera keeps moving, but...

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:28.040
Okay. Do we need to pause?

01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.040
We can always...

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:32.040
I'm very sad.

01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.040
I think we've had a good game insertion.

01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.040
We do not actually have to... Yeah, I don't want you

01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:38.040
to actually be sick

01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.040
by this game.

01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:42.040
If it's too much, please don't be afraid to say no

01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:44.040
because I can literally mean and chat

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:46.040
and ask questions and stuff.

01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.040
I'm trying. I'm trying to

01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.040
get through it.

01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:52.040
Okay. How about we finish this

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:54.040
goofy level and then maybe call it

01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:56.040
there because I don't want you to be sick.

01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:58.040
Yeah. Is she going to be bothered?

01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:00.040
Yeah. Okay. Well, great.

01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:02.040
Right. Let's just check the list to make sure

01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.040
we need to steal

01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:06.040
a glass paint

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:08.040
and drop it in the canal. I don't even know

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:10.040
where that is. We just need a knife, a fork,

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:12.040
and a candle. Okay.

01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.040
Don't worry. There's a candle there.

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.040
Okay.

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:18.040
Oh, she's right there again.

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.040
Oh, that camera angle.

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:22.040
She doesn't bother with us. Does she?

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:24.040
No, she's just happy.

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:26.040
She's like, what a curiosity.

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:28.040
You're breaking up my day.

01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:30.040
Thank you, little geese for showing up.

01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.040
I was like, oh, you're welcome. Right. Where is this

01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.040
fork?

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:36.040
Sugar.

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:38.040
She's going to see me.

01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:40.040
No, no, no, no, no. You don't see me.

01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:42.040
I am a mystery.

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:44.040
Oh, metal bones.

01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.040
No, no, don't push me that way.

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.040
Mercy's that way.

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:50.040
I'm getting pushed out.

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.040
I'm literally getting pushed out of the camera.

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:54.040
I can't bring you closer to the stairs.

01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:56.040
That's okay.

01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:58.040
I'm trying to grab the knife.

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:00.040
Game devs, you really

01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:02.040
have done yourself with this one.

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:04.040
I think I'm getting shoved.

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.040
I know you're stuck.

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:08.040
I am complete. I can't even see myself.

01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.040
Hold on. Hold on.

01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:12.040
Hold on. Here we go.

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:14.040
Wait, hold on.

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:16.040
I need to snipe his shoes, basically.

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.040
Okay.

01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:24.040
This isn't...

01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.040
Development team.

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:28.040
You need a hand?

01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.040
Yes. Go, tie your lace

01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:32.040
as it's dangerous to go.

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:34.040
Wait, I can't even get past?

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:36.040
Bro, you ain't even got...

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:38.040
The whole mechanic was that he...

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.040
You take your shoes off.

01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:42.040
I'm being trolled so hard this game.

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:44.040
Hold on. Let me just move underneath.

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.040
No, never mind. I'm out of bounds now.

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.040
Yeah, it keeps...

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:50.040
I can't even get past. Okay, there we go.

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:52.040
Oh, we did it. We did it. We did it.

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:54.040
Go, go, go.

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.040
No, no, no, don't send me out again.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.040
Don't send me out of bounds again.

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:02.040
Oh, it doesn't matter because he's chasing you.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:04.040
No, I want my knife.

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:06.040
Well, one of us can...

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:08.040
I've taken the knife.

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.040
The knife.

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:12.040
Oh, no, no, he's got you.

01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:14.040
Well, sorry, I'm running.

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:18.040
Pick up the knife, please.

01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.040
Okay, there we go. I got it. I got it. I got the knife.

01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:22.040
Run.

01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:24.040
Run.

01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:26.040
Okay, we did it.

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:28.040
My controls are not nice.

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.040
Help!

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:32.040
Help!

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.040
I can't even see you.

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:36.040
I can't even see me!

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:40.040
Wait, the guy doesn't respond

01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.040
to honking at all?

01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:44.040
He doesn't care!

01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:46.040
No!

01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:48.040
Oh, he sucks.

01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:50.040
I don't like him.

01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:52.040
Oh, no, I have made a grave error.

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:54.040
Go, I need to go underneath

01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:56.040
or above either one.

01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.040
No, I'm getting pushed out.

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.040
He's such a bully.

01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:02.040
Oh, well, I can just sneak over.

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:04.040
Can you maybe run, please?

01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:06.040
Nice lady.

01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:08.040
I can't hear until he stops being aggressive on us.

01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:10.040
He is like the worst.

01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:12.040
Yeah, darn it.

01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:14.040
He's not having any of it.

01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:16.040
No, no, wait, he shouldn't know where it is.

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:18.040
I left it on the other side of the fence

01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:20.040
at the table

01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:22.040
that we set up so it should be fine.

01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:24.040
Our knife is...

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:26.040
Yeah, go away, mister.

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:28.040
Go, go away, mister.

01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:32.040
Literally, he's so aggressive against us.

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:34.040
This is discrimination.

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:36.040
I'll be talking to the BBC.

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:38.040
Exactly.

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:40.040
I'll be doing a report.

01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:42.040
I'll be getting interviewers out here

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.040
so everyone can learn of your dastardly...

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:46.040
Right.

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:48.040
Hide under the table.

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.040
What's this?

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.040
What is it?

01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:58.040
I don't know, but...

01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.040
I'm pulling.

01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:02.040
Oh my god, it's how I get a beer.

01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:04.040
Wait, but I don't have a glass.

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:06.040
Sugar.

01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:08.040
Well, I've got a fork.

01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:10.040
We need to fork anyway.

01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:12.040
Let me get out of here with this fork.

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.040
I don't know where the glass of beer is, though.

01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:16.040
I'm underneath, so she can't get me.

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:20.040
I think we broke it.

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:22.040
We did.

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:24.040
So how on earth did we get...

01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:26.040
Well, I did.

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:28.040
Um...

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:30.040
Ah, I knocked it over.

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.040
No, no, it's okay. I think it still counts.

01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:34.040
As long as it's on the table, I think it counts.

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:36.040
Wow, I'm doing a little 360.

01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:40.040
All right, it says...

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.040
A knife and a candle. We actually do have a knife.

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:46.040
Oh. Right, we just need a candle.

01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:48.040
We've done this really awkward part.

01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:50.040
Why won't it stand?

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:54.040
Okay, let's do this approach.

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.040
There we go.

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:58.040
Or do we have to, like, actually set it...

01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:00.040
Like, the fork goes on the left.

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:02.040
The knife goes on the right type stuff.

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:04.040
Nah, they wouldn't put that in the game.

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:06.040
They wouldn't put that, right?

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.040
I feel like that's, like...

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:10.040
How do you know your knowledge?

02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.040
Well, I cannot pick up the fork.

02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:14.040
Is it glitched out?

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.040
It says the fork is there. Okay.

02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:18.040
It still counts. We've got to get the candle now.

02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:20.040
This is the candle.

02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.040
And then we're done this terrible back and forth section, I think.

02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:26.040
Where was the... Hello.

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:28.040
Hi. Oh, sorry.

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:30.040
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be in your way.

02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:34.040
Wait, she's pushing me out of the way.

02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:36.040
Stinky.

02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.040
You want to give me all the attention, lady, don't you?

02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:44.040
Yes, you do.

02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:46.040
Where did she put the candle?

02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:52.040
Is that the best paper again?

02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:54.040
It may be.

02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:58.040
I'm just a goose getting all the attention.

02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:00.040
For no... Oh, I'm stuck on her.

02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:02.040
For no particular...

02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:04.040
I'll go under the deck.

02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:08.040
Yes.

02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:10.040
Oh, sugar. Okay.

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:12.040
You got it.

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.040
I don't know where she...

02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:16.040
Oh, my game. My game just closed.

02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:18.040
Whoa! However, I think you're going to have to come

02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:20.040
down these stairs and then come underneath with me here.

02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:22.040
If I don't get chased out, yes.

02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:24.040
Yeah, come this way, this way.

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:26.040
No, no, no, no!

02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:28.040
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:30.040
Send it, send it, send it!

02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:32.040
Okay, okay, I think it's okay.

02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:34.040
I think it's okay.

02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:36.040
I've got the candlestick.

02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:38.040
Oh, no.

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.040
That's the main thing. As long as we got the candlestick,

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.040
I can get you back in.

02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:44.040
All you have to do is unpeel as we...

02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:46.040
Yeah, you're not coming under here.

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:48.040
Oh, wait, why did I hit her?

02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:50.040
Uh, you might be able to get past...

02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:52.040
Yeah, you can get back in

02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:54.040
if I distract him enough.

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:56.040
And then come under here with me.

02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:58.040
No!

02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:00.040
This guy sucks!

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.040
Oh!

02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:04.040
It controls, it controls.

02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.040
Okay, we're safe, we're safe.

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:08.040
The heat is now off of us.

02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:10.040
Oh, you can see my little red flippers.

02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:12.040
I like my little flip-flops.

02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.040
Okay, he has gone back.

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:16.040
I think we can now go to the wee restaurant.

02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:18.040
The wee restaurant.

02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:20.040
I'm stuck on something.

02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:22.040
We casually scroll in.

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:24.040
You're stuck?

02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:26.040
I'm like getting stuck on stuff.

02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:28.040
There we go.

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.040
I don't know.

02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:32.040
Okay, there we go.

02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:34.040
Wee!

02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.040
We finally frickin' did it!

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:38.040
This one was not easy.

02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:40.040
I think it's the control and the camera.

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.040
Yeah, this camera angle

02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:44.040
is spinning around every two seconds.

02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:46.040
Oh, I'm stuck again.

02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:48.040
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:50.040
Is that vomit burp?

02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:52.040
I'm getting nervous.

02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.040
It was the motion sickness burp.

02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:56.040
I'm so sorry, excuse me.

02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:58.040
Actually, we can stop.

02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.040
I didn't know when you just hop on our first collab.

02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:02.040
Because we picked up this motion.

02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:04.040
Okay, if that was a vomit burp,

02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:06.040
I'm happy to say we have set the table.

02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:08.040
Yeah, we set the table.

02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:10.040
Okay, I am not going to make you play anymore.

02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.040
I really do not.

02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:14.040
Any issues?

02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.040
Okay.

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.040
We will say thank you so so much

02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:20.040
for letting us have

02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:22.040
an absolute carry on.

02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:24.040
Unfortunately, we thank you.

02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.040
I stupendously

02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:28.040
asked her to

02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:30.040
play a motion sickness

02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:32.040
and juicing game. I had no idea

02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:34.040
that the camera angle was so violent

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:36.040
towards her, per mercy.

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:38.040
But I think

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:40.040
I'm happy to say we'll end it there.

02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:42.040
I don't want any vomit.

02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:44.040
Okay, that's the bottom line.

02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:46.040
Okay, that's the bottom line.

02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:48.040
No vomit please.

02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:50.040
I'm sorry.

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:52.040
No, don't be sorry.

02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:54.040
I was like, oh, it was so good.

02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:56.040
I haven't burped yet on stream.

02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:58.040
Oops.

02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:00.040
We'll play it safe.

02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:02.040
Please do not worry. Let's play nice and safe.

02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:04.040
We will say to the snippets

02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.040
and the reeflings. Thank you so so much

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:08.040
for watching.

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:10.040
I am streaming again tomorrow.

02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:12.040
Merci. Are you streaming tomorrow?

02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:14.040
Is the real question?

02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:16.040
No, I place my day off.

02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.040
Well, I'll put her to work

02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.040
lads. Don't you worry.

02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:22.040
I'll make an ASMR for her to put her to work.

02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:24.040
Don't you worry about that.

02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:26.040
Teasing. Teasing.

02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.040
She'll have a break.

02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:30.040
We will leave it there

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:32.040
and I'm going to let you know

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:34.040
that we're going to be playing

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:36.040
a motion sickness game.

02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:38.040
We'll leave it there

02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.040
and I'm going to let Merci lie down

02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:42.040
because I think she needs a good nap

02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:44.040
or maybe a big lie down

02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:46.040
and some fizzy juice to help her feel a bit better.

02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:48.040
But thank you so so much

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:50.040
for joining me, Merci. I appreciate that so much.

02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:52.040
And that was actually genuinely really fun.

02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:54.040
So much fun.

02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:56.040
As chaotic as that game was,

02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:58.040
that was actually hilarious that you

02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:00.040
started controlling my goose.

02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:02.040
Wow, yandere powers.

02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:04.040
Literally.

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:06.040
That was supposed to be that most of this one here.

02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:08.040
Right. Thank you so so much.

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:10.040
Thank you everyone.

02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:12.040
I'm going to end a little strum.

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:14.040
Oh wait, no, no one's streaming

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.040
because you're the one that normally streams lads.

02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:18.040
Should I?

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:20.040
Let's see if there's someone on you.

02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:22.040
Let me check with one of the girls.

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:24.040
Let me check if I can find it.

02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:26.040
Azura rated it in a U.S.

02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:28.040
That means she finished her cheeky stream,

02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:30.040
her cheeky bricky stream.

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:32.040
There are some girls

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:34.040
on. There's Rain

02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.040
from Ume Plus

02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:38.040
and a bunch of

02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:40.040
VNU girls are on too.

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:42.040
I have not

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:48.040
I will do Rae from

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:50.040
Thingy because I don't think she's monetized yet.

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:52.040
She will watch Time.

02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:54.040
Yeah, let's Rae into Rain.

02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.040
I will Rae into Rae. She's doing

02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:58.040
unicorn overload, number two,

02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:00.040
shipping characters to fight better.

02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:02.040
This one's like a

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:04.040
vanilla wear game.

02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:06.040
It's supposed to be really good.

02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:08.040
Have you played it before?

02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.040
No, I haven't.

02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:12.040
But I'm a fan of vanilla wear

02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:14.040
games.

02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:16.040
That's cute.

02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:18.040
Thank you so much, Sneeflings.

02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.040
Thank you so much, Mersey, for joining me.

02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:22.040
Please do get some serious rest

02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:24.040
because I do not want any.

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:26.040
How terrible is that headline?

02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:28.040
Collab

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:30.040
results in like vomit.

02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:32.040
What kind of collab is going on

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:34.040
if that's the case?

02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:36.040
Thank you.

02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:38.040
I missed some soupas.

02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:40.040
Thank you so much.

02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.040
Misaka best for the

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.040
420 blazes.

02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:46.040
Stop goose hate. Thank you so much

02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:48.040
for the tip you with me.

02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:50.040
Thank you.

02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.040
For the five dollar

02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:56.040
super chat. Did you know Rick

02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:58.040
Ashley is never going to give you up.

02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:00.040
Never going to let you down.

02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:02.040
Never going to let you down

02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:04.040
twice. Never going to run around

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:06.040
and desert you. Yes, I knew that.

02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:08.040
Thank you so much for the five.

02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:10.040
Wow.

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.040
Thank you so much, everyone

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.040
for such a wonderful stream

02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:16.040
and thank you.

02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:18.040
It was unexpected that

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:20.040
we hit such a

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:22.040
dizzy game.

02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:24.040
We got so close though,

02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:26.040
but I would not have picked that game

02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:28.040
had I known how spinny camera it was.

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.040
I thought it was

02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:32.040
a straightforward linear

02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:34.040
experience. So I do apologize for that

02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:36.040
oversight, Mercy. It's okay.

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.040
Honestly, everything looked

02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:40.040
like it was going to be fine, but like

02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.040
yeah, that was

02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:44.040
every time we entered or moved around

02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:46.040
somewhere, the camera just like violently

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:48.040
spins over.

02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:50.040
Sorry to anyone that also has

02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:52.040
motion sickness watching. You probably feel like

02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:54.040
right now.

02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:58.040
Okay.

02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:00.040
Right.

02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:02.040
I will let you get going.

02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:04.040
Thank you so much, Mercy.

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:06.040
Let's put it to the end stream

02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:08.040
and then we're right into rain.

02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:10.040
Yeah. Yes.

02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:12.040
Okay, I'm end streamed. Bye bye, replays.

02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:14.040
Bye bye.

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:20.040
In the broadcast.

02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:24.040
Successfully.
