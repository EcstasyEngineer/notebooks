1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What's that? Hold on, hold on, you put the light onto the fucking tracking thing.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ah, it's blinding! It's blinding, it's looking good.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Me? Hmm, why do I need to wear glasses? Also me, because blasted.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
About, like, one minute late, she hates us.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You stop that, you naughty Nellie.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You naughty soft fans.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You naughty ballbags. I actually don't say that word, that's fine.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, I mean, that's another word.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Uh...

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Um...

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Are we here? Hello? Hello? Hi! Hello America! Hiya! Hiya!

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh my god, what's that?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We get to do another full day of Assassin's Creed.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I get to, yeah, ease as much as I like.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Uh, I do want to say I am very thankful to PayPal support.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yay! PayPal unblocked this.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Because if you didn't know, yesterday, you guys unanimously, at the same time,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
supported, like, everyone with donos.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And PayPal was like, halt, halt.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This account has been paused because what on earth are all these things?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And we literally had to go, oh, hello there PayPal.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Uh, we're streaming.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Uh, we're beach homers. Please unblock.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So you can support my daughters.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Uh...

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Good morning!

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good evening!

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And most of all, good afternoon reeflings!

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you ready to fuck up your sleep pattern?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,080
Do do d, d, d, d, d, d, d.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,120
Do, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd, dd, d,d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd, d, dd, d, dd, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd,

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,540
How are you?

33
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,000
And you did? It was Aisy looking after you.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Did anyone touch your tummy?

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't lie, Aisy's best design element is her tummy, her navel.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you didn't know, a belly button is also a refer to as a navel.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,240
I understand you can't hear the background music, oh I've seen some creepy brotherhood right now.

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Ask that memean, erm.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,240
I apologise for being a whole 60 seconds late.

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,740
Do you want to know why I'm 60 seconds late?

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,240
Cos I was trying to arrange another Ace Markalab.

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,740
Um, I've recorded one with Mimosa, I need to edit it.

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,500
I do not know how long today's stream is gonna be, so feel free to strap in.

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
And if not, I'll be the one wearing the strap in this relationship.

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Ah, that's terrible, absolutely terrible, just started.

46
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Erm, but it's been fantastic.

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
I should hopefully not miss any freaking donations.

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Like I did yesterday, cos I was absolutely awful.

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I just kept missing everything left and right.

50
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Everything left and right.

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Left and right.

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Oh, that's not how I can read.

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Okay, there we go.

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Woo, five hours of sleeping, eight hours of work, and we're so bad.

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Oh, please rest, okay.

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I can, I literally, I brushed my teeth, I had a shower.

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Right, well I'll tell you something gross whilst we jump back into the action.

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I'll tell you something nasty.

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Why can I not hear my game?

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Hello? Headset?

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Headset?

62
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Headset, I know there's, hello?

63
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Okay, I cannot hear any sound and the game isn't coming out of my fucking desktop.

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Are you fucking serious?

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
By the way, this game lives up to the test of time.

66
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Are we being true?

67
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Why is it not coming out of desktop?

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Is this a fucking joke?

69
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,500
How could this have been so scuffed?

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I can't hear the game either.

71
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Okay, fantastic.

72
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Fantastic!

73
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
No, seriously.

74
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
The tips link is messed up again.

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Are you joking? God, I'm so scuffed.

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Um...

77
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I am speechless on why the game is not playing through the desktop audio right now.

78
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Hold on, let me start clicking stuff and see what happens.

79
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Okay, I need to start clicking stuff.

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Why would the game not be detectable via the desktop audio?

81
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
I am totally not raging right now.

82
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Let's check, let's check.

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Right, okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me click.

84
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Rule one, if something doesn't work, close the game and open it again.

85
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Because why would it not be detectable on desktop?

86
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
That's rule one of gaming.

87
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Okay, so I've closed it.

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
It's now closed, you can't see none of it.

89
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Also, I listened back.

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I was watching a bit of my own brotherhood gameplay.

91
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
My voice actually doesn't sound that messed up,

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
but I can hear it and feel it myself how messed up it is.

93
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Yep, again, no audio.

94
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,500
If I have to go offline to troubleshoot this, I'm gonna be so mad.

95
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Why? I didn't do anything.

96
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I, Mercy, has literally made a short about this exact scenario.

97
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I cannot make this up.

98
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Mercy has a short coming out later about this exact situation.

99
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Game, audio output settings, hold on, hold on, hold on, manage input devices,

100
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
output devices, sound mixer, is it sound mixer?

101
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Input, yep, output, yep.

102
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Why the frick?

103
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Why the frick fracked Italy deck, tic-tac, petty whack?

104
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Would this not be coming out?

105
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I think I actually have to go offline to frickin' jumpshoot this.

106
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I'm not even kidding.

107
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,500
I can't believe this.

108
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Are you joking?

109
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
It only took me seven minutes to start the stream!

110
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Oh, 49% total synchronization.

111
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Oh, I guess we are doing 12 hours then if I'm only at 49%.

112
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Let's go.

113
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Literally, Mercy made a short about this.

114
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
I cannot wait for the short to come out so you guys can be like, oh my god.

115
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Oh my god, she was right.

116
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,500
If you are not up to scratch, please do not worry

117
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,500
because we have successfully finished campaign mode.

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,500
We are currently playing Landlord Simulator 2 by all of the buildings at the moment.

119
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,500
We are now doing the kind of side quest-esque missions.

120
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,500
We are about to do a very sad mission for the auditory family.

121
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Me, I'm still here.

122
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

123
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I hope all is good.

124
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I believe Asakul is the only other member live at this moment.

125
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
But as always, when another member goes live,

126
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I will force you to go insane to her stream.

127
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Okay, here we go.

128
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I do not normally do this so I'm not too familiar with what happens next.

129
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I think Asi is going offline.

130
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
That's Leonardo.

131
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
That's Leonardo's voice.

132
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Desmond's heart rate is increasing.

133
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
I'm administering a sedative.

134
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
No, the missing data may be there.

135
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
The piece of Eden is useless until we have-

136
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh, I don't remember much of this.

137
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Yes, William.

138
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Yes, William, congrats if your name's William.

139
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Any Williams in her?

140
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Eh?

141
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Eh?

142
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
The Da Vinci-

143
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Eh, Da Vinci- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

144
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
The Da Vinci Disappearance.

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Did you know?

146
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I remember.

147
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Leonardo.

148
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Good friend.

149
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Thank you.

150
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
I see you're reading Super Chess at the moment.

151
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Wait, she got monetized?

152
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
She couldn't have.

153
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
I didn't link that.

154
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Did you mean Donation?

155
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
No, they were doing- I was gonna say.

156
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
None of us have monetization here.

157
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Uh, I think one of my assassins came back for success.

158
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
We're from a mission.

159
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
It's gonna be da Mona Lisa.

160
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
And that smile.

161
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Overdone.

162
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm so sorry, AC, I never managed to catch any of the-

163
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Snowberries!

164
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Any snowberries?

165
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Hi, Snowberries!

166
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
He's a part of the campaign.

167
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Get raided, get raided, get raided!

168
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Get plopped, get plopped, get plopped.

169
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Are you squidding me right now?

170
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Ah, thank you for the 20.

171
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Bajinga, what the fuck?

172
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
There's no way that says Bajinga.

173
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Did I read that right? I read it in the top corner.

174
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Thank you Bajinga for the-

175
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
What? You didn't even leave a message!

176
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Why are you called Bajinga?

177
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Oh, now I can't read chat.

178
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Oh god, I'm so brain dead.

179
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

180
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Bajinga?

181
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Bajinga?

182
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Good morning.

183
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I'm glad you like icicles.

184
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Ah, it's the woman.

185
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Did you see the guitar AC design?

186
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
No, I didn't manage to catch her stream.

187
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I was uploading everyone's Patreon audios.

188
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Did you know?

189
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Honestly, me is real.

190
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I'm good to go.

191
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
She designed one for everyone.

192
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Oh, I need to watch that VOD then.

193
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
No, no, there's not new audios on Patreon.

194
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Sorry, I scheduled up everyone's Patreon audios.

195
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm really struggling to know how to tag though.

196
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
If you didn't know.

197
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Of men?

198
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
You worship their misery?

199
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
No, mate.

200
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I actually prefer

201
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
holes and no poles.

202
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Then he's swinging that way, but

203
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I actually need nothing against a mate.

204
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Wait, is this DLC?

205
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Yeah, I think so.

206
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
My main quest stuff, this is side stuff.

207
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Okay, ready to kill.

208
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
No reactive model today?

209
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I never put it on.

210
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
I've got this though.

211
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
That's if I make a joke, I can do that.

212
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, combat.

213
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Hold on, hold on, get the wee knife out.

214
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
And let them attack you.

215
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Oh, I can call them assassins.

216
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
So if I make a pun that I like,

217
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
I can literally do that.

218
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Okay, the assassins on the horse, I'm happy.

219
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Can you get off the horses?

220
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Oh, that was brutal.

221
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
You can attack me then.

222
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Whoa, I missed that.

223
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Okay, there we go.

224
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Please, God, do that.

225
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
It's hilarious.

226
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Yeah, so if I come up with a really good pun,

227
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
all you're going to hear is that all day long.

228
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Right away.

229
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Casually kills a dozen people.

230
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Zoom, my man.

231
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Apologize.

232
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Any apologizers?

233
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Me, man, let me burp.

234
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
No, sorry, let me raid the horse.

235
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Geez, I didn't mean to say that.

236
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Literally what I was about to do.

237
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Why is he running?

238
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Why you won't?

239
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I drink honey tea.

240
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I have a lovely honey tea.

241
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Just for me.

242
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Some honey tea.

243
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
And a game

244
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
full of nostalgia.

245
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
And I'll play

246
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
and ramble all day.

247
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
So I can

248
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
enjoy

249
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
the game with you.

250
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm not even, I don't know

251
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
what the tone of the song is after that come with me.

252
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Yeah, there you go.

253
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Wait, so what are you?

254
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I am a cuttlefish.

255
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm a siren

256
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
and a cuttlefish.

257
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
But the problem with being a siren is

258
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I can't sing.

259
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
I can't lie on my hypnotic abilities

260
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
to steal the hearts

261
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
of men

262
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
and then perish them in the war.

263
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
I did not make

264
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
my lore, by the way.

265
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
But in terms of who's the most

266
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
evil

267
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
out of all of us in Vealor,

268
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I'm pretty evil.

269
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Then it goes Emi, but Emi isn't inherently evil.

270
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
She just really wants her brother back

271
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
and she does stuff to entertain herself.

272
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Okay?

273
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I drink some tea, so if I

274
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
start hypnotizing it's because I'm drinking tea.

275
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
I would, oh you'd perish

276
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
in my water, willing?

277
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Follow me!

278
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
We are following

279
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
the leader

280
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
the leader

281
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
trailing behind the leader

282
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
going ahead of the leader

283
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
the leader

284
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
the leader

285
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
oops

286
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
oops I don't think I'm supposed to be at this section

287
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
because they could spot me a mile away

288
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
but hey ho

289
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
somehow things work out in the end.

290
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
It speaks volumes about Vealor

291
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
but the most evil person is not the goat goddess

292
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
but the fish.

293
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
No! Azura created you

294
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
she's your literal mother

295
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
she created humanity

296
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
as we know it.

297
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Like

298
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
so Azura is like the kindest

299
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Mercy's just

300
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
misdirected, okay?

301
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Mercy's just

302
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
misdirected, okay?

303
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Mercy's just

304
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
misdirected, okay?

305
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
She just doesn't understand

306
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
because she does genuinely

307
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
love

308
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
but sometimes that love

309
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
results in

310
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
your expiration date

311
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
which is a shame

312
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
but she doesn't mean it, okay?

313
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
She's wholesome

314
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
She's like a dark yandere

315
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
She lures your guard

316
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
and then before you know it

317
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
the finishing act

318
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
the guard will discover

319
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
and then, yeah

320
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
he found the entrance to a temple

321
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
oh we're learning about catcomes

322
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
that we can go in

323
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
oh this is the DLC called Leonardo's Diaries

324
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I just remember that literally

325
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
right now I thought it was an auditory

326
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
something discovered by some scholar from Lechia

327
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
in fact

328
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
taste my blade

329
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
taste my

330
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
oh no we're just

331
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
for size

332
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
oh I got double ear assassins

333
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Rick, wait I'm going to take a quick

334
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
drink of my tea, I apologize

335
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
don't like her to see views, I'll just part of her plan to lure her in

336
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
to her watery graves, oh my god

337
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
that was such a hard word to say

338
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
watery graves

339
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
watery graves

340
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
terrible, here again

341
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
we are jumping into the DLCs

342
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
of

343
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, we've finished the main quest

344
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
we are going to try and 100% this bad boy

345
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
I think I can do it, I have no idea

346
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
I did not look up what the tank mission is

347
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
so I'm getting scurred

348
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
DLCs

349
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
delicious

350
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
not neutral, well maybe mainly

351
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
a honey is very good for

352
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
avoiding illness

353
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
put antelab

354
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
and take back cereal

355
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
sorry that guy's talking

356
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
at the same time and it makes it hard to

357
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
talk and think

358
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
wow, AI

359
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm a beautiful fish

360
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
oh we should watch that movie

361
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
that the song is like

362
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
I'm a little little fish in the

363
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
deep blue sea

364

374
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500

375
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm on the floor

376

no help

377
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
strong evil intentions

378
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
through kind acts

379
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Amy kind intentions through evil

380
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
basically Amy just wants her brother back

381
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
and she kind of has a bit of fun

382
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
with the spells really

383
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
that's how she was contemplated

384
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
oh the young Leonardo

385
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
the temple he discovered

386
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
where is it

387
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Leonardo

388
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Salahi you want to save

389
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
and tell me where the temple is

390
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I do not know

391
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
cazzo

392
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
etcher

393
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
something is written on the floor

394
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
what does it say

395
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I cannot read

396
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Leonardo

397
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
but now

398
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500

399
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
he wants us to examine art

400
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
I remember when Leonardo

401
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Leonardo

402
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500

right we're going to keep doing a Leonardo situation

421
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
so if you didn't get any of that put

422
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Leonardo has been yoinked

423
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
and he discovered

424
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
some sort of advanced

425
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
advantageous

426
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
things that would

427
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
pardon me excuse me come through

428
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I was reading chat excuse me

429
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
excuse me sir

430
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
have you heard about this

431
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
have you seen this about chat

432
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
oh my god

433
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
slay them right now yeah slay them

434
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
my deans

435
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
and then I'll do the rest of the work

436
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
okay I got you covered baby

437
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
baby

438
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
oh Catherine

439
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Christina is coming up

440
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
alright we'll do Christina

441
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
okay so basically we

442
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
stalked her home

443
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
and then we got a kiss

444
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
so

445
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
surely this isn't going to get weird any further

446
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
reading chat obviously was a mistake to do

447
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
I know literally doing it like in a game

448
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
is so hard

449
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
let strongy lead my pleasure

450
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
I remember that

451
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
I was a bit sus

452
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
I have to admit it's you

453
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
now we

454
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
the girls can do it to you

455
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
that's fine

456
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
yeah that's fine

457
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
other way around

458
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Christina we're in

459
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Farenzy

460
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500

461
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
oh

462
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
this is so sad

463
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
in Assassin's Creed 2

464
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
your family get hung

465
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
due to treachery

466
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
this is

467
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
really sad this

468
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
I don't like this one this is pretty

469
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
freaking sad honestly

470
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
I can't remember the past though

471
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
this is very sad

472
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
so the girls yeah yeah so we can do it to you

473
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
but you're not allowed to do it to us

474
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
come here you fanny

475
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
oh I missed

476
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
that was really embarrassing actually

477
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
imagine someone coming to punch

478
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
I did it again I'm like punching the air

479
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
this can't be one air that's going on with him

480
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Assassin's Creed 2 is actually very beautiful

481
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
considering how old it is

482
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
I don't

483
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
want to speak

484
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
because I don't know for a fact

485
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
this might genuinely be the imported map

486
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
from Assassin's Creed 2

487
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
where the heck am I trying to go

488
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
swinging it

489
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
his family's

490
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
to be honest it was

491
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
his first day

492
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
I don't know

493
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
unquestioning me

494
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
that's a very hard word

495
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
that's a big word for strongy

496
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
right if I remember correctly

497
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500

498
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500

499
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500

it was actually so freaking sad

549
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
in Assassin's Creed 2

550
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
so your mother

551
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Maria

552
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
she doesn't talk until you collect

553
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
100 feathers

554
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
because Pietro

555
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
the wee little brother

556
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
was collecting feathers and once you collect

557
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
all 100 feathers she finally speaks her first words

558
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
after the death of everyone

559
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
and it's just like

560
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
a freaking sad thing genuinely

561
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
and then this is your dad

562
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
oh it was so sad

563
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
literally so freaking sad

564
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
yeah the feather quest

565
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
that's why there's 10 feathers

566
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
in this game

567
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
I guess it's in memoria

568
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
oh

569
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
me

570
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
actually so sad

571
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
she doesn't

572
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
ah

573
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
she doesn't come with those

574
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
in

575
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Christina's Etsy was like

576
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
true love

577
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
and then so sad

578
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
she's feeding corpses to the fishes

579
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
oh that's true

580
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
and there was no in-game map for the feathers

581
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
do you want to hear the worst part

582
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
about the feather quest in Assassin's Creed 2

583
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
so my

584
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Xbox was in a different room

585
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
from where the computer was in my house

586
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
so I would have to

587
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
scurry to the living room

588
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
and memorise a location of a feather

589
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
and then scurry back through to

590
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
my Xbox as a child

591
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
my mum was like

592
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
what on earth are you doing

593
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
I'm getting worried about you

594
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
and I was like the feathers

595
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
mum the feathers I need the feathers

596
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
what do you need the feathers for

597
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
I was like scurry and back and forth

598
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
like

599
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
all of that

600
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
and I did it once

601
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
I've never done it again

602
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
but we'll probably try and do it when we play AC 2

603
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
these are DLC

604
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
I

605
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
allegedly like so the way I memorised

606
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
things I don't have a very good like brain

607
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
so I had to

608
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
open my eyes really wait and

609
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
oh it's the crit sale

610
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
wow

611
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
wow

612
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
so after chaseries

613
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
date with bait

614
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
the crit sale got married off

615
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
and Chanel is on the countryside and hiding

616
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
but yeah I used to like have to

617
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
in order to memorise stuff

618
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I had to open my eyes really

619
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
which I know seems bizarre

620
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
but it's the only way I could do it

621
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
I just had to go like oh

622
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
and then like I wouldn't blink and then I'd run

623
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
to the Xbox and like where the location was

624
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
it sounds really dumb now that I'm saying it out loud

625
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
but it was the only way I could do it

626
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
like the like phones weren't

627
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
like well I didn't have a phone

628
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
it was

629
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
because I was a child and like

630
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
yeah phones weren't like that

631
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
um

632
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
wee

633
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
this is

634
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
really dangerous because I actually don't know which way

635
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
okay okay that was lucky

636
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
eyes wide must take all information

637
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
I was literally like sorry can't speak

638
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
don't talk to me

639
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
and then I'd get another feather

640
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
and then come back through and look at the next one

641
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
and if

642
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
you like pick up feathers on the way

643
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
it actually makes it a bit harder

644
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
where is that heck am I supposed to go

645
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
there are guards everywhere

646
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Lecretia is

647
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
is that just a straight jump I think so

648
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
okay

649
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
you don't hear a grown man

650
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
fall into here literally

651
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
oh my back

652
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
yeah

653
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
yeah you don't remember

654
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
which feathers you pick up along the way

655
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
so it makes it even harder

656
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
because if you go to the area you think

657
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
it was that

658
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
um

659
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
sorry I got nervous I'm about to go the wrong way

660
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
I can reach that

661
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
jeez

662
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Skyrim logic

663
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
best logic

664
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
sorry is there

665
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
I think

666
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
no there can't be flags on the DLC

667
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
that's not allowed

668
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
wow that camera angle change

669
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
sheee

670
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
wee

671
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
although I will say one thing

672
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
about this DLC this is so satisfying

673
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
because um you really won't get caught

674
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
by the guards doing this

675
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
you can literally parkour your way through it

676
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
and the guards don't actually catch you

677
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
which I see is very

678
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
satisfying gameplay wise

679
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
but it's satisfying yes

680
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
um

681
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
I do like the idea of like it's

682
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
he'll be able to like completely sneak undetected

683
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
without the fear of being detectives

684
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
wee

685
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
oh my god

686
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
ugh I have terrible news

687
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
aren't you pee already um

688
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
yeah like see I love this

689
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
this is like so satisfying

690
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
like I'm just quietly

691
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
sneaking around

692
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
ooh

693
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
we're in the gardens of

694
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
whatever that goddess name is

695
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
and I've already forgotten

696
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
what the garden's called

697
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
okay this is the bit where you can

698
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
lose

699
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I think

700
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
right you can't climb the hedge

701
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
I guess

702
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
okay

703
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
as if they don't hear me

704
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
fucking

705
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
what was that supposed to do there I have no idea

706
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
oh I just went for it

707
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
they are so dead

708
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
honestly this outfit they're gonna

709
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
kill me a nice

710
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
gentle

711
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
or should I say

712
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
a borrowed

713
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
title bestowed by my husband

714
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
ill-fitting and barely concealing

715
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
the truth

716
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
you can keep your life

717
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
I am here for the art on your walls

718
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
I'm redecorating are we

719
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I'll redecorate that win

720
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
I'm sorry

721
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
if only it were that easy

722
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
my birth place

723
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
she is home

724
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
and you like her haze

725
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
I do not believe you

726
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
frightening is it not

727
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
you have lost so much

728
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
perhaps

729
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
we can comfort you

730
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
we are really a ladies man

731
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
where are the paintings

732
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
sold to Francesco Colonna

733
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
and one to someone who was special

734
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
to me patricio

735
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
he spends his time near ilvatica

736
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
not gonna lie reflin if you did that to me

737
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Edmill

738
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
give it to me

739
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
guards

740
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
place the winch's

741
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
in a cart

742
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
leave it outside the walls

743
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
no

744
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
no gobbene

745
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
now close your eyes

746
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I don't remember what's happening

747
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
there's no way

748
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
we killed her brother

749
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
and forgive me to Kessa

750
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
what for

751
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
no man can heal your pain

752
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
you must do so on your own

753
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
no we won the scene

754
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
say hello to the duke for me

755
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
guards

756
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
see all you had to do

757
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
was put your pole in the hole

758
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
and now the guards are on us

759
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
it's so it was that simple

760
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
come on

761
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
you heard that doctor at the start

762
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
there's a cure for syphilis

763
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
I don't know where to go

764
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
this is the most logical reason

765
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
because why would you put the stairs at 12 o'clock

766
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
I don't know where to go

767
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
there's a timer

768
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
there's so many guards

769
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
inside

770
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
ok

771
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
ok

772
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
ok across the chandelier

773
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
unfortunately

774
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
don't look down

775
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
ok

776
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
sorry I cannot reach

777
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
I'm getting stressed

778
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
there's a freaking timer

779
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
ok and then we

780
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
and then run across

781
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
ok we can do it

782
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
come on I say

783
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
scared

784
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
oh sorry I didn't mean to whistle

785
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
I just whistled because I was breathing

786
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
with the small mouth

787
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
my pardon

788
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
your pardon I beg

789
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
I don't say my pardon you beg

790
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
but you don't need to ask me

791
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
oh did we do it?

792
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I was actually really quick

793
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
1 out of 5 paintings

794
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
ok we nailed that

795
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
we nailed that

796
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
we absolutely nailed that

797
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
who's pardon now

798
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
that was

799
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
scary but we did it

800
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
only 1 minute and 57 seconds

801
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
is fair

802
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
ok

803
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
that went so well

804
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
honestly can you distract on a horse

805
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500

00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500

942
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
am I supposed to kill them

943
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
lol

944
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
what the heck is going on

945
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
oh

946
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
what is going on

947
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
I am so confused why aren't they attacking me

948
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
are they scared of me

949
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
I am tailing

950
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
we will be glad to add it to our collection

951
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,500
as agreed

952
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
I got you a fresh and cool iron bridge please

953
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
she thought I would be pleased with such a gift

954
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
after she married another man

955
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
you're alert literally every enemy

956
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
was looking at me

957
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
and nothing happened

958
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
both may be brought into harmony

959
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
doubtless

960
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
I think I thought you were going too far away

961
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
literally

962
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
I don't know if that was just like streamer buff

963
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
or something

964
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
is there a group ahead

965
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
other than that group there

966
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,500
I feel like they are about to stop and turn around

967
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,500
so I am hiding here

968
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
they are behind guards

969
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
can I climb that

970
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
oh it's a three storey building though

971
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,500
can I climb here

972
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
I will climb this

973
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
oh whoa

974
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
I am sorry

975
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
oh don't use the brief tops

976
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,500
I am sorry

977
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
how is that

978
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
what is going on with this mission

979
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
why isn't everyone

980
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
so unresponsive to me

981
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
genuinely like

982
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
what is the game like

983
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
being nice to me

984
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
take this

985
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
I wasn't to be detected

986
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
I was literally going to smoke bomb them

987
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
and walk past them

988
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
oops

989
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
I am not to be detected yet

990
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
everyone is refusing to detect me

991
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
what

992
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
okay

993
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
and I have already failed it

994
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
yeah so I can go on the roof top

995
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
right I am not to be

996
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
detected

997
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
okay so I will go around this part

998
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
of the street

999
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,500
am I going to run out of time

1000
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
because I can't see them out my way

1001
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
that was

1002
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
smoke bombed yourself out of a whole mission

1003
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
literally

1004
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
I cast evasion

1005
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,500
and I completely I roll the one

1006
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
how

1007
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
is this how

1008
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
is this such a

1009
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,500
rather confusing mission

1010
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
I have to admit

1011
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
I assume he is going to come out here

1012
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
so I am not going to I just want to look at him

1013
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
so I don't oh it's a bit too close for comfort

1014
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,500
I am a lady

1015
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500

I am allowed to make these jokes though

1022
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500

1023
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500

flexibility you will never guess

1032
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
what I can do with that

1033
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
I cast itchy

1034
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500

00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
I have already forgotten what I said

1043
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
going to be honest truth you are going to need to

1044
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
sub quote everything because I always

1045
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
forget what else I see

1046
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
okay okay

1047
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
oh I knew you were going to turn around

1048
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
that's right I got the eagle sense

1049
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500

1050
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,500

1054
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,500
this is like very close

1055
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,500
I wonder if they are going to turn him around again

1056
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
like they did earlier in that section

1057
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
because I am getting nervous

1058
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
I do not remember playing the DLC much

1059
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
pardon me

1060
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
excuse me

1061
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
oh we did it

1062
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
success

1063
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
cast

1064
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
your voice

1065
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
you will complete the sale

1066
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
of course

1067
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
hello hello

1068
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500
the error lies in your spanish blood

1069
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
I know it

1070
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
such untruth you so casually utter based

1071
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
on little more than a name

1072
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
these countries these groups

1073
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
make such easy targets for the lazy

1074
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
and ignorant

1075
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,500
you should tell her that the high

1076
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
and mighty duquesa putana

1077
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
I have changed my mind

1078
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
that painting does not deserve to belong to anyone

1079
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
take the painting and examine it

1080
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
for clues

1081
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,500
be careful

1082
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
human hands aided by a fierce intelligence

1083
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,500
made that

1084
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
treat it with respect

1085
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
go

1086
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
he casted London experience

1087
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
no

1088
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
oh I am to destroy him

1089
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
refillings

1090
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
destroy that man

1091
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,500
what he is so fast

1092
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
how am I desyncing

1093
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,500
he is literally faster than the speed

1094
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,500
that I can run at

1095
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,500
I am not sure why the game is telling me

1096
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
careful you are desyncing

1097
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,500
get arrow stormed

1098
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
get arrow stormed

1099
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,500
you deserve it

1100
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,500
stinky

1101
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,500
leave the Vatican district

1102
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,500
working on

1103
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,500
there was a pole there that you could have grabbed

1104
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,500
to save the health of your ankles

1105
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
I am not going to take responsibility

1106
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
for you being sore

1107
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,500
that was point blank

1108
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,500
that was point blank

1109
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,500
no excuse

1110
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
I am trying to escape

1111
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,500
this district

1112
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
it puts you all the way into

1113
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
a certain section of the map

1114
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
by the way go all the way out of the section

1115
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,500
shake all about

1116
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
you do the hokie pokey and you run around

1117
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
and that is what it is all about

1118
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
hey

1119
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
that is green

1120
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,500
let's start watching

1121
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,500
I am suing viewer

1122
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,500
your pentas

1123
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
have you drawn your pentas a little too much

1124
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,500
the funniest thing

1125
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,500
I got a few maros

1126
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
I wouldn't say anyone was like disgruntled

1127
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
I think they were surprised

1128
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,500
so out of all the four audios

1129
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
for sheebie

1130
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,500
three of them are her in control

1131
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,500
and one of them is her not in the controlling position

1132
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
guess which one you all voted

1133
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
well the majority voted for

1134
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,500
the one where she was

1135
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,500
and then I got a few messages

1136
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
and I am like ah please

1137
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
I kind of maybe need to explain it a bit better

1138
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
we are working on

1139
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
making graphics so you know

1140
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
what content is coming up

1141
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,500
it just takes time

1142
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
we are settling into everything

1143
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
obviously emi got a warning recently

1144
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
in sheebie's

1145
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
lower video got 18 plus

1146
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,500
so I think we are actually debating

1147
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,500
about deleting it to try and

1148
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
ensure she gets monetization

1149
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
I would be mortified for the girls

1150
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,500
if they didn't get

1151
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
like they were rejected from youtube

1152
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,500
monetization because of me

1153
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,500
because member the girls didn't pick their designs

1154
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,500
and I would feel like so upset

1155
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,500
like don't get me wrong

1156
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
there's still stream elements, there's still patreon

1157
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
there's still tips on stream in general

1158
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
which is perfectly fine

1159
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
heck am I supposed to go

1160
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
but I would be mortified

1161
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,500
for the entire month for monetization

1162
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,500
streams all because I didn't think

1163
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,500
I had to get a toggle to cover up

1164
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,500
the cleavage

1165
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
hmm

1166
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,500
what do you normally need to do to get monetized

1167
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,500
500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours

1168
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
but your channel

1169
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,500
can still be rejected

1170
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
which is understandable

1171
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
they need to go through the content

1172
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
but I'm hoping

1173
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,500
all things considered

1174
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
if the girls are sitting doing game streams

1175
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
and all of that it's just another

1176
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
they're just gamers pass it on

1177
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,500
obviously before we could launch

1178
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
I could only spell out so much

1179
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,500
don't be silly

1180
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,500
of course

1181
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
the girls aren't going to be

1182
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
am I not to be detected

1183
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
don't detect me I'm scared

1184
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
get in here

1185
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,500
who dares approach the veil of hey

1186
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
right we're just going to go for it

1187
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500
cause there's no need to

1188
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,500
assume we can just run

1189
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,500
right those guys are bugged out

1190
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
cause that guy

1191
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,500
literally couldn't give a left boot crack

1192
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
ooh I'm going to hurt my ankles

1193
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,500
thank goodness we have the armor

1194
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,500
cause yeah

1195
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I'm just going to run

1196
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,500
for the objective there's no point

1197
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,500
to stopping and fight cause it's one of those ones

1198
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,500
where they just keep

1199
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
spawning in with more guys

1200
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,500
and it's just a waste of time

1201
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
we're trying at 100% this

1202
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,500
I say that as if we don't have to

1203
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,500
redo all of this again probably

1204
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
to get 100%

1205
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,500
I actually don't know what

1206
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,500
oh no 100% was don't be detected or something

1207
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
that is impossible if they're going to just

1208
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
constantly spam enemies

1209
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
may I sit on the bench please

1210
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,500
oh

1211
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
it's him

1212
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,500
he was rude to claudia

1213
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,500
is he

1214
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,500
he's the baddie

1215
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,500
from claudia

1216
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
he used to harass claudia

1217
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
our sister

1218
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,500

1219
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500

1220
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
he insulted claudia

1221
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,500
we are only talking are we not

1222
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
I see this place has

1223
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
worked its magic on your sister

1224
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
she did not want to open her legs

1225
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,500
in ference

1226
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
but now she is the madame

1227
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500

00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,500

1229
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500

1231
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500

1234
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
but that does not mean

1235
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
they will take you back

1236
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
he counters me you know what time it is later

1237
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,500
we're going to remove his ability to have children

1238
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
I cast no children

1239
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
I cast no lineage

1240
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
I cast no bloodline

1241
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500

intended to be one of us

1253
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,500
but we all knew you were outside

1254
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,500

1255
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
templar identified

00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
lineage deceased

00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
timstones erased

1258
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
women forbidden to marry

1262
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500

1269
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,500

do I kill them one by one

1305
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,500
right in my mouth

1306
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500

1307
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,500

right there's two of them

1310
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
so I don't think I can do it

1311
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
right next to him

1312
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,500
I mean there's we can almost come back

1313
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,500
and redo this mission

1314
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
you can just

1315
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,500
can I just arrow storm them

1316
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
I can

1317
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
okay so there's literally one more pair

1318
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
okay I didn't realize I could use arrow storm

1321
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
the

1322
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,500
I think I'll just send an assassin

1323
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
on this guy because I don't want to mess up

1324
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,500
if I can get 100% right off the bat

1325
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,500
no you won't

1326
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,500
wait it's already filled

1327
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,500
because I failed it earlier

1328
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,500
okay I must have already failed because I failed it earlier

1329
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,500

1330
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,500

oopsie

1334
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,500
the pink

1335
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,500
I didn't realize there was like one big continuum

1336
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,500
nice my bad

1337
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
I'm gonna apologize for that one

1338
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,500
okay we'll definitely have to redo that one

1339
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
later time but that's okay

1340
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
we're getting close to finishing the

1341
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,500
painting

1342
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500

01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,500
a 500

1345
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,500
500 floor in

1346
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,500
a bribery is actually

1347
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,500
a lot of money

1348
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,500
you could like buy a lot

1349
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,500
back in then

1350
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,500
surely

1351
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,500
I swear I could fish Duccio out

1352
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,500
just to punch him again

1353
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,500
literally

1354
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,500
in assassins creed 2 he was

1355
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,500
really horrible to Claudia

1356
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
so I'm glad they brought him back

1357
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
but I didn't

1358
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,500
expect oh that happens

1359
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,500
every time I launch off the boat

1360
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,500
I never

1361
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
expected

1362
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,500
what are you

1363
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
hello

1364
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,500
what

1365
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
what

1366
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
what was that

1367
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,500
what was a jester

1368
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,500
why was a jester attacking me

1369
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,500
is this like a secret thing

1370
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
kill

1371
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,500
jester

1372
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,500
well I did kill jester but

1373
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,500
multiplayer character

1374
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,500
possibly I don't think I've ever seen that

1375
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,500
before

1376
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Elden Ring mentioned

1377
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
he literally as

1378
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,500
I thought he was going to be like a fight

1379
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,500
fight but I just swung once

1380
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,500
and he was gone

1381
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
we can't really continue the game

1382
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,500
if we kill jester

1383
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,500
sorry traveler

1384
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,500
we cannot progress if we kill him

1385
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,500
don't just

1386
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,500
don't

1387
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,500
okay

1388
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
the jester is killed you cannot progress

1389
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
bye

1390
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
literally

1391
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
just slapped him and he spun into the war

1392
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,500
hello my lady

1393
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,500

1394
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,500
so is this before she's an assassin

1395
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,500

1396
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,500

1397
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,500

1398
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
girls will accompany you

1399
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,500
bonafortuna and don't get caught

1400
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,500
bonafortuna

1401
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,500
do not let guards discover

1402
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,500
any dead bodies inside the restricted area

1403
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,500
these are

1404
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
I'm starting to get worried about me 100%

1405
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,500
in this game

1406
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,500
I'm getting nervous

1407
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,500
I'm getting a little shaky what have I gotten

1408
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,500
myself into

1409
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
now

1410
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,500
now I'm confident in like playing the game

1411
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
in general 100% in it

1412
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,500
I have to admit my confidence levels are diminishing

1413
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,500
the further into the game we get

1414
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,500
because it's starting to get pretty

1415
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
like the ones where it was like

1416
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,500
don't take damage fine I can do that

1417
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,500
please leave me alone

1418
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,500
no

1419
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,500
they're so aggressive

1420
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,500
watch out if they pass

1421
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,500
with their camera and their glasses

1422
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,500
and they can't keep

1423
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
a lid

1424
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,500
da Vinci

1425
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,500
says

1426
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,500
what am I supposed to do over here

1427
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,500
I hope it's not get caught

1428
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,500
oh I've gotten sheepen

1429
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
mate you guys can all attack each other

1430
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
smoke bomb

1431
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,500
that was cool

1432
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,500
I don't want to stab him

1433
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,500
oh I

1434
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,500

1435
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,500
hello lady I would like to talk to you

1436
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500

01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,500
you must believe she through

1438
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,500
promise me over here

1439
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,500
we believe that you can beat this

1440
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,500
oh you believe in me

1441
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,500
oh

1442
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,500
I'm getting nervous I'm getting

1443
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,500
shaking

1444
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,500
I'll try my best

1445
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,500
I mean it's not like we've like

1446
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,500
hashtag failed or anything

1447
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,500
in all honesty

1448
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,500
don't let a guard see a dead body

1449
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,500
so if I kill everyone

1450
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,500
can I be the tip

1451
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,500
oh I can't be the tip

1452
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,500
I always do that I'm like

1453
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,500
okay

1454
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,500
don't let a guard see a dead body

1455
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,500
right okay let's try that again

1456
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,500
so guard no

1457
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,500
detect

1458
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,500
oh

1459
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,500
I'll try it but I feel like

1460
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,500
this is most likely a try hard replay

1461
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,500
section

1462
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,500
because yeah his

1463
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,500
dead body is like literally ready to drop

1464
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,500
unless I can drop it in the water oh no

1465
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,500
right we're gonna put it in this

1466
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,500
okay let's try that again

1467
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,500
we did get caught red handed holding a

1468
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,500
dead body okay one more time one more

1469
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
time one more time for the back

1470
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,500
getting from the baby

1471
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,500
can't believe it after one

1472
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,500

1473
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,500

but etio

1573
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,500
I'm not even chasing him across the bridge

1574
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500

1575
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,500
etio

1576
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,500
I've never struggled with this

1577
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,500
you guys are wondering why I can't play

1578
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
rage inducing games

1579
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
I just start screaming

1580
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,500
I'm not sure anyone wants to listen to me screaming

1581
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,500
be miserable

1582
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,500

1583
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500

1584
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500

1585
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
everyone's dying

1586
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,500
he is literally coded to be faster

1587
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,500
than me

1588
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,500
he is literally coded to be faster

1589
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,500
than me

1590
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,500
is this where I'm supposed to stay on the bridge

1591
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,500
you're the freaking ghost

1592
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,500
I know I'm happy again because I got what I wanted

1593
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,500
so annoying

1594
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,500
literally

1595
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,500
now don't just stand by the need to chase mission stuff

1596
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,500
but

1597
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,500
bruv

1598
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,500
I have zero faith I'm gonna be about 100%

1599
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,500
in this game

1600
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,500
if that chase sequence

1601
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,500
included don't be caught by a card

1602
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,500
is it on the bridge

1603
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,500
my apologies

1604
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,500
are you sure you played this

1605
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,500
completely 118

1606
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,500
yeah that's why I can not play

1607
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,500
rage inducing games

1608
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,500
because it's a miserable experience

1609
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,500
I do have one donathan reward

1610
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,500

01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500

01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,500
if you didn't arrow storm

1615
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,500

1616
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,500
no I got caught at that earlier like grab the letter

1617
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,500
you need to not get caught at any stage

1618
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,500
which is insane

1619
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,500

1620
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,500

1622
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500

1623
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,500

about this one painting

1664
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,500
they need to like get on

1665
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,500

1666
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
hold

1667
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,500

1679
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,500

01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,500
shovels are the most OP enemy

1698
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,500
literally they distract

1699
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,500

1700
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,500

1761
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,500

you guys were fantastic

1764
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,500
that took me quite a hot second

1765
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,500
to progress

1766
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,500

1767
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,500

1768
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
the front entrance?

1769
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,500

1771
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,500
online

1772
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,500
no more hand holding

1773
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,500
no you're allowed to hold my hand

1774
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,500
because I actually

1775
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,500
don't mind it

1776
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,500
some streamers like really don't like it

1777
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,500
and I'm like but I'll miss things

1778
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,500
if I don't get help

1779
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,500

01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,500
not done this much I do apologize

1786
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,500
so the Leonardo missions

1787
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,500
and the DLC stuff

1788
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
yeah I not really

1789
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,500
had my time

1790
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,500
okay

1791
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,500
please don't turn around

1792
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,500
please don't turn around

1793
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,500
asking a lady for

1794
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,500
unprotected hand holding

1795
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,500
are you allowed to do that in conventions?

1796
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500
I've seen Japanese conventions where

1797
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,500
I fucked that up so badly

1798
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,500
no it's you

1799
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,500
jeez eyes

1800
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,500
we almost got caught

1801
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,500
I

1802
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,500
I've seen like the Japanese

1803
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,500
idol stuff where you can just like straight up

1804
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
talk face to face with your idol

1805
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,500
and stuff and I think that's a really cute idea

1806
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,500
there's an enemy up ahead

1807
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,500
sorry

1808
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,500
there's no weapon 100% in this stuff without using ranged weapons

1809
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,500
this isn't say hey hey

1810
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,500
like genuinely the same

1811
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,500

1812
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,500
fuck off

1813
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,500
do I need more enemies?

1814
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,500
whoa whoa that's a big pain

1815
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,500
sheath

1816
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,500
there's someone in here

1817
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,500
no no

1818
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,500
it's not true

1819
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,500
escape

1820
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,500
without being detected

1821
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,500
okay

1822
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,500
why am I supposed to not be detected?

1823
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,500
there's two

1824
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,500
and a freaking guard up there

1825
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,500
hello

1826
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,500
hello

1827
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,500
oh I can be detected

1828
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,500
I'm sorry I'm just really dumb

1829
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,500
I don't know when I'm not to be detected

1830
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,500
pardon me coming through

1831
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,500
excuse me

1832
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
where did he go the guy says

1833
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,500
cause I'm still literally out here killing

1834
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,500
where

1835
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,500
am I just to leave the castle in general?

1836
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,500
I have no idea

1837
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,500
if we're looking north of the castle

1838
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,500
I need to go south of the castle

1839
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,500
this is brutal

1840
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,500
I'm rubbish at the DLC honestly

1841
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,500
yeah I'm gonna

1842
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,500
literally 96.96

1843
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,500
I'll take that cause

1844
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,500
yeah there's absolutely no way

1845
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,500
wait I'm still gonna be outside the walls

1846
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,500
if I claim to the top of that

1847
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,500
is it gonna take me outside the castle if I jump down?

1848
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,500
cause I'm 99% sure you can claim the top of this

1849
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,500
so we're just

1850
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,500
gonna do it for the yolo

1851
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,500
be on the lookout for a thief

1852
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,500
me I'm the thief

1853
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,500
oh wait no I can't be detected

1854
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,500
silly me

1855
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,500
jump it's okay

1856
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,500
well don't jump then

1857
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,500
fine let's just fight

1858
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,500
we're gonna jump off the top of the castle

1859
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,500
cause I think it takes us

1860
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,500
out of bounds of the actual area

1861
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,500
hello bye bye

1862
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,500
that thief me

1863
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,500
I'm only not dying on site

1864
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,500
oh boy

1865
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,500
here I go killing again

1866
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,500
oh wait

1867
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,500
hold on this isn't a jump point

1868
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,500
I don't think

1869
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,500
I see a flag up here

1870
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,500
yeah I'm gonna be honest I don't really want to jump

1871
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,500
into a balahee from this height

1872
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,500
is that a feather or a flag?

1873
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,500
the flag

1874
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,500
I'm gonna be honest as

1875
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,500
oh that's the hay bale

1876
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,500
I'm supposed to jump into

1877
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,500
whoa this is a big map

1878
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,500
oh look there's the thing

1879
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,500
and you can see the colosseum in the background too

1880
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,500
honestly this map is humongous

1881
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,500
do you remember that?

1882
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,500
okay

1883
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,500
right let's try

1884
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,500
this again

1885
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,500
I don't really want to be on the site of

1886
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,500
the castle but

1887
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,500
it's where it's taking me

1888
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,500
so

1889
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,500
there's really more jump points

1890
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,500
oh it's the courtyard again

1891
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,500
okay okay

1892
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,500
the humongous oh it was crazy

1893
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,500
humongous what?

1894
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,500
what are you on about honestly

1895
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,500
where the heck am I supposed to go to this castle

1896
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,500
I'm so like swapped about

1897
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,500
I know there's a ledge

1898
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,500
okay I'll get down

1899
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,500
get down

1900
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,500
left or right

1901
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,500
okay this way

1902
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,500
jeez we got there in the end

1903
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,500
I have not woken up clearly

1904
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,500
I think I might need to get a call

1905
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,500
or something like I don't feel like I'm here right now

1906
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,500
this is the most pathetic

1907
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,500
wait

1908
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,500
it made me go out of bounds only to tell me the map

1909
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,500
is right

1910
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,500
why would anyone

1911
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,500
stop I don't need the lore and the paintings

1912
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,500
I need the map

1913
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,500
can I have the map please

1914
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,500
map map map

1915
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,500
map I need the

1916
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,500
oh wait it's straight ahead

1917
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,500
oh

1918
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,500
oh it's because of the bridge

1919
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,500
you're really good at this game

1920
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,500
maybe yesterday

1921
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,500
yes but today

1922
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,500
rough very rough gameplay

1923
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,500
I still don't think a man can jump 100 feet

1924
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,500
maybe I'll be fine honestly

1925
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,500
game please I don't care about your stinky pay

1926
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,500
I literally I do like that they genuinely

1927
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,500
put like all that lore and I'm sure like others

1928
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,500
appreciate it but I'm so sorry I'm very

1929
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,500
like them

1930
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,500
I can't be in there's only

1931
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,500
so much knowledge I can inhale

1932
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,500
not PewDiePie not the bridge

1933
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,500
that's terrible

1934
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,500
yesterday's Nike Daily

1935
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,500
before we set which is 4pm

1936
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,500
and that's kind of annoying

1937
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,500
is Nike Gacha

1938
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,500
I just know it's got pretty girls

1939
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,500
and people like the pretty girls

1940
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,500
use your head more than your brain

1941
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,500
I'm literally like

1942
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,500
use your head however we're gonna solve

1943
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,500
this problem to open the door

1944
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,500
yes you're right use my head

1945
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,500
I'll ram it against the door until it breaks down

1946
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,500
that's how I am

1947
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,500
we are gonna hire because we are gonna try and get the

1948
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,500
favor of everyone at some point

1949
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,500
so we're I'm gonna take that money

1950
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,500
at the bank because your bank interest can

1951
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,500
actually get full

1952
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,500
and then you're kinda wasting

1953
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,500
that income

1954
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,500
free money

1955
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,500
actually the hay bale

1956
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,500
this should be as high as the jumping point

1957
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,500
to be safe to enter

1958
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,500
I don't wanna use my head

1959
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,500
okay last one

1960
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,500
of the Leonardo mission

1961
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,500
not the war machine mission

1962
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,500
oh sorry I just need to click with it

1963
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,500
I think it was like 5 for the core

1964
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,500
did you see get busy as distraction

1965
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,500
that's a bit on the nose don't you

1966
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,500
look

1967
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,500
now we need a

1968
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,500
did you know strongy

1969
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,500
no

1970
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,500
I always think watch someone forgets a pitch fork

1971
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,500
in that hay bale

1972
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,500
as if he knows it's going good

1973
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,500
we're finding Leonardo

1974
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,500
he's been taken we need him back

1975
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,500
strongy's a hammerhead caught a fish

1976
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,500
wow

1977
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,500

ooh we did it we did it okay I understand

1995
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,500
I understand this one has been searched entirely

1996
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,500
five minutes five minutes five minutes let's go

1997
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,500

Use your eyes look alive look alive. Reflings. I need your eyeballs glued to the screen right now

2003
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:31,940
Scanning scanning. Oh, was that one? No, I'm dumb. I'm dumb. I'm dumb

2004
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,460
Do not scan do not scan. It was a mis-input

2005
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:39,460
Rubber shit this honestly

2006
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:44,700
Okay, okay, uh-huh, uh-huh, okay, we can start from the bottom

2010
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:10,260
Haha, what was that? What was that? Analyze? Analyze? No, you're right

Okay, okay, last one last one five minute timer last one. Where is it? Why are you hating them from me?

2013
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,980
Oh, it's the girl with the ferret and

2014
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:32,300
It's schnozer. It's Emmy with her rat

2015
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:35,300
plural

2016
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:39,220
Wow, wow, wow, wow so fast so fast so furious

2017
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:44,560
We did it I found two drawings

2018
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:48,740
Checkpoint reached give me that hundred percent

2019
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:53,140
No, no, no, no, no, I have found all the images. They seem to fit together

2020
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:57,140
Bring me paper and ink

2021
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,280
We get to find Leonardo and save him

2022
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,580
Where's nickel cage really?

2023
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:09,340
Is this how museums work scanning scanning scanning show me the end

2024
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:13,740
It's not over. Oh, no wait

2025
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:19,380
What about the burn paintings? It's not over. It's likely they missing parts will not be needed

2026
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,020
Care to bet on that

2027
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,220
No

2028
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:28,900
I'm gonna have to use logic. Oh, no. I suck at this. Ah, okay

2029
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:32,900
Okay, possible outside right corners start with corners whenever you do a puzzle starboard corner

2030
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:38,980
Miss input. Oh north north corner. We have a north corner. Let's go right north corner. So you can't be a north

2031
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:45,340
Hold on. What are you? I don't know. Well, right. You're a middle piece. You're an outside piece

2032
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:48,580
Put the outsides on the outside, I guess

2033
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,620
Okay, you have to be a bottom piece I guess

2034
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:58,340
Okay, you're a corner piece. Oh, there is here. I see I comprehend my apologies

2035
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:02,040
Right, you definitely do not go there. Whoa. Whoa, you fit you fit you fit

2036
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:08,700
That's good. That's good. That's good. How about you? No, no five-minute timer. Okay. Wait, where's the corner pieces?

2037
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,900
Am I going crazy?

2038
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:15,500
No, some of the pieces were lost in the Villa fire

2039
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:25,780
What do you want me to do about that well you can't go there you definitely don't leave

2040
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,300
Oh, but that could be a bottom corner

2041
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,860
Could it? Oh

2042
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,860
No, wait, how did I do that?

2043
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:48,540
Okay, I comprehend why this is a five-minute like timer. Oh, you definitely don't go there actually you fit there

2044
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:52,740
Okay, okay, okay, okay

2045
01:35:52,860 --> 01:36:02,180
No, maybe this pull plausible that I believe no, no, yes

2046
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:07,420
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, uh-huh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

2047
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:12,620
Maybe maybe here. No. No, you have to be an inside piece. You can't be there

2048
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:15,780
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah

2049
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,660
Uh-huh

2050
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:19,060
Yeah

2051
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:21,060
Wait a match is gonna do in five minutes

2052
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:24,060
Yes, oh

2053
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:29,940
There's no way that was so good

2054
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:33,660
I'm so proud of myself

2055
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:39,900
I was like, huh? Where's the other corners cuz whenever you do a puzzle you're to start with the corners and the other side pieces

2056
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:42,780
And then I read they're burned in a fire. Excuse me. Oh

2057
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:48,180
Can't believe I did that. I'm actually so smart with a heck

2058
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:58,700
I deserve all the headpats and preys and a tummy stuffed full of who goes there I don't find yourself

2059
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:01,900
Wait is

2060
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:04,460
Wait, what?

2061
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:10,860
Where am I supposed to go? Am I supposed to go for you? No. Wow. It's actually overlaps perfectly

2062
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:19,580
Hi, I'm back you we're currently rescuing Leonardo da Vinci they have kidnapped him

2063
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:26,220
And we're taking him back. He belongs to us. Okay, one of us one of us

2064
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:33,940
We're about to grab him I may get a cola. Oh, we're going to a layer of

2065
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:41,380
Romulus I might get a cola as a reward for being so smart

2066
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:43,700
Oh

2067
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:54,700
There's no cutfish, but it's good to do. Yeah, they're both cephalopods. Oh, you're gonna pet the cephalopods

2068
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:02,460
Okay, we're definitely in catacombs

2069
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:04,780
Um

2070
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:12,180
Time

2071
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:18,620
It's been an hour 30 already with the heck I was about to be like oh she be is gonna be on in an hour

2072
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:20,620
I thought 30 minutes have gone by

2073
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,380
whoa

2074
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:26,960
That's scary how like potent you guys are holy crap. That's scary

2075
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,060
I

2076
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:36,580
Believe she becomes online or she already online is she be online?

2077
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:45,740
Or just come online in 20 20 minutes

2078
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,940
In 20 minutes, okay a warning for

2079
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,500
The fan concept name was love bunnies, but I don't know she

2080
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:06,860
How dare you do such a thing to Leonardo

2081
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,740
You disgust me

2082
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,220
And I'll make it hurt

2083
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:18,900
Normally I am merciful that Leonardo is a dear friend of ours

2084
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:26,220
And you hurt him that is foolish. I'll make sure your death is as long as painful

2085
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:34,100
Nero, thank you very much for the tip low reward for having solved the puzzle

2086
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:38,420
No, don't give me money because I did I played a video game

2087
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,980
Thank you, though, I appreciate it

2088
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:48,540
The reeflings have a mascot design absolutely today I'll show you I

2089
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:54,620
Didn't show it on the debut you absolutely have a mascot design

2090
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,420
I've only made freakin

2091
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:04,820
Wow

2092
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:10,540
Yes, you have a mascot design you have a little love heart on your tent cause you have a nicotine patch on your head

2093
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,040
Oh

2094
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:16,780
My goodness the door I might go get that fail like right now when I go get that cooler

2095
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:20,460
It may be on discourse

2096
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,700
Oh

2097
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:38,220
Kicking him or would you rather I used my knife on the contrary there is nothing I would like more than an amiable solution

2098
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:46,380
Help Leonardo see reason with the Patigarian Unifier. We will remake humanity together not under my

2099
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,700
Then the revolution will begin without you

2100
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,900
Oh

2101
01:40:56,980 --> 01:41:01,820
Bring it I dare you I dare you straight green

2102
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:07,220
I'll strike heart in the fears of the man. How dare you hurt my friend Leonardo?

2103
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:16,500
Take this and this you're next don't grab me don't touch me the goods aren't for free in this place. Ah

2104
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:25,940
Hey, it's so fun watching them fall on by one

2105
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,300
This is what you get

2106
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:36,060
We're hurting Leonardo. Don't do it again. I'll make you regret it. Yeah, you better start panicking

2107
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:41,780
Oh, yeah, I

2108
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,500
So

2109
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:47,340
You'll never guess what my daytime job is

2110
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,420
killing people

2111
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:57,420
You want to beg for your life now should have thought about that first before hurting Leonardo

2112
01:41:58,140 --> 01:42:00,140
No, no, don't let them talk just

2113
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,500
Me of knowledge

2114
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,940
One must choose to search for truth

2115
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:09,380
Forcing it on others accomplishes

2116
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:12,020
These lost people

2117
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:15,420
Warring kingdoms I

2118
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:20,500
Would have ended there's I know your element is what we're going down women. You have fire

2119
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:24,620
Like grass it today

2120
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:32,300
Mmm, I will pay anything for your goods. Well, they're free. Um, I

2121
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:36,780
Keep saying I'm gonna make an audio. I'm gonna make an audio. It's just that so busy

2122
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:42,820
I'm a busy busy be come. Let us leave this come. Oh, we can get you

2123
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:46,920
Not without reaching the final room of the temple you are hurt

2124
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:53,380
Leonardo you have two black eyes right now. You did not look good. Come on

2125
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:57,180
Go to sleep Leonardo. You need to rest

2126
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:59,180
Oh

2127
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:15,340
He looks so being off. I hope he's okay. Why are we getting locked in we literally just walking into our tomb, I guess

2128
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:20,340
Thank goodness. I sent Massimo to look for my paintings. It delayed their progress significantly

2129
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:24,060
Why is there a random treasure box? I honestly don't do it

2130
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:28,020
Whoa, I really don't recall much of this

2131
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:32,740
The Pythagoreans

2132
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:38,300
Like a beam of light ignites fire which symbolizes knowledge

2133
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:47,340
Wow, I'm gonna say something controversial this reminds me of the blades

2134
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:53,180
From Skyrim quest when you enter their place

2135
01:43:55,060 --> 01:44:01,820
Now before you're like brain rot gamer brain rot. Yes, I know stone and leaves don't equal

2136
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:07,420
Level thing, but I'm just saying my brain is tickled

2137
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:17,980
That's cool

2138
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,500
I

2139
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,340
Yes, I know where to go

2140
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:29,460
This stat you okay face stat you

2141
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:33,580
Okay, okay, the camera angle is gonna help us out. That's what I like to see

2142
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:41,620
Do we need a bit she goes live in 13 minutes? I repeat it not love bunnies because I'm pretty sure the name's being changed but

2143
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:45,940
She be warning in 13 minutes to my

2144
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:50,980
The blades you mean the organization we all kill

2145
01:44:56,660 --> 01:45:00,140
Her fans are called Haram wait for real for

2146
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:02,860
having

2147
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:04,860
Like a Haram

2148
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:09,300
Thank you for cheering me on Leonardo

2149
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:12,740
I'm gonna do it. Oh, I need to come up

2150
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:15,740
Oh

2151
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:29,140
I said here I'm not Haram my apologies. My apologies. I hear them. Okay. That's genius

2152
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:40,220
Little bit to the left wait if I just go down back. Oh, no, no, I'm supposed to go here

2153
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:44,180
It's pretty clever, honestly

2154
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:49,060
I'm like you guys are named after Lord of the Rings. Let me be happy

2155
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:52,820
Why the half

2156
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:58,060
Why the refling I do not know

2157
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:04,740
Maybe it is because they give me courage we must continue onward

2158
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:10,660
Hmm, I suppose Salah is out having fun spending my ardent Florence

2159
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:16,420
He is safe at home. I'm relieved about the Florence, of course

2160
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:18,940
You do not need to lie to me

2161
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:23,380
Salah if you give the blessing I am

2162
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:26,660
Leonardo da Vinci and a loss for words

2163
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,340
That is a burst

2164
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:32,420
Also M for

2165
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:35,860
Masked this room could use a little

2166
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:42,460
Leonardo a kudibaturi

2167
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:46,820
He is soupy now the sound of wind

2168
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,980
You hear that sound of wind

2169
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:57,580
Wow

2170
01:46:57,580 --> 01:47:02,300
Okay, I said these DLCs maybe weren't worth that. I don't know what their base price was but

2171
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:04,660
Wow

2172
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:13,500
Leonardo just casually talking to us while we're literally doing like the

2173
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:20,780
Just jump on the face. Oh, yeah. Yeah, dude

2174
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:26,100
Here rabbit aim

2175
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,380
Whoa, that's really smart, okay

2176
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,060
Must have been the wind

2177
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:40,060
Now I can get back up here. Oh

2178
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:47,740
I didn't even I was like where the heck am I this camera angle is wild

2179
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:58,100
Oh, hey, so we're getting a bit dangerous out here. I'm not gonna lie. I'm gonna be nervous. I'm gonna be shamed

2180
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,100
A

2181
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:04,980
Little bit windy up here. Yes, I'm a tummy's rumbling. I forgot to eat

2182
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:11,860
I

2183
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:20,700
Maybe we finish

2184
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:35,900
My father, uh, maybe we get cooler and I'll get my snackie wackies again, and then that will refuel me

2185
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:39,860
Why

2186
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:53,220
Oh, there's a bar right there, I'm very struggled with the DLC. I can't believe it. Where's where's the yellow paint?

2187
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:55,220
I

2188
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:03,100
What snack time snack time is the exact same as yesterday I am going to have I have one egg

2189
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:08,700
Today because I forgot to boil more eggs before stream. So I have one egg left over

2190
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:15,420
I will have two meat sticks and I will have pea snacks as well with a cola and water

2191
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:20,580
Um, I don't think I'll make another tea. I'm not really feeling like a tea right now

2192
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:27,380
I had one before I did my very quick ASMR recording session. I had one when I started to stream. So tea maybe not right now

2193
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:34,020
Wow, I hope this is the right way. I've just launched myself down there without actually checking

2194
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:40,820
So anyway, when was the last time you had vegetables? I actually do struggle to eat vegetables. The problem with

2195
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:43,820
streaming long is

2196
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,860
I need snacks

2197
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:50,740
But on short stream days like I can make myself an actual meal. So don't worry about me

2198
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:55,380
I know I had takeaway yesterday. I have my chicken burger on my chipies. I

2199
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,140
Had

2200
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:04,780
Breakfast English tea, I believe it's called. Oh, she be eight minutes

2201
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:08,500
Haram, Haram hair and

2202
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:12,580
She be eight minutes

2203
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:18,740
Uh

2204
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:22,980
But yet for long day for long streams, it's much

2205
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:29,300
I am really struggling. You can tell I've hardly played the DLCs. My goodness

2206
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:33,220
Oh, it blasts into the campaign, but then the DLCs makes them possible

2207
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:43,140
Me clings and worrying is like people breathing honestly. Whoa. Oh, that's cool

2208
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:48,900
Wait a minute, didn't this not happen with the blades as well?

2209
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:53,620
That's good help. Oh, we know Skyrim came out in 2011

2210
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:58,020
Yes, how enlightening very funny

2211
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:04,580
Jump oh jump cross. Sorry

2212
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:10,260
Confused and it's like, uh, what do you want me to do me? This is literally a wall and I'm like a jump on it

2213
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:18,660
Wow

2214
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:20,980
Wow

2215
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:24,660
On a scale of zero to one how good of a cucumber? Um

2216
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:34,020
For the foods that I like hundreds for the foods that you guys might like, uh, not so good

2217
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:44,100
Hey, oh, I thought I was having to jump on the fire there. I was like this is gonna be good

2218
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:48,180
Oh

2219
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:55,540
These sound effects are so different from regular assassin's feet as well

2220
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:00,740
I am enchanted the music is different as well for the DLCs

2221
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,700

2224
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:16,340
That means everything

2225
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:24,820
It's he was currently setting up the most intricate game of the floor is lava honestly

2226
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,060
I've like really blown away right now

2227
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:34,500
Like I keep saying to myself like this is such an old game like it's it's 2010 like

2228
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:37,860
And all of this is in the game

2229
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:40,900
It's fantastic

2230
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:43,780
Fantastic fantastic

2231
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,300
All right, you can just pre-mix this

2232
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:03,300
Oh

2233
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:10,900
Beijing girl, thank you for the tip go go bed. I enjoyed you. Thank you so much. See you when you wake up

2234
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:18,180
Can you bake as well? Yeah

2235
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:26,660
I have my unity is achieved, but the door is not opening my favorite thing to bake is apple cinnamon muffin

2236
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:33,700
Because I like apple cinnamon. Oh, pardon me. Let me touch this

2237
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:37,300
Let me commune with the post

2238
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:40,820
Leonardo come here

2239
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:46,260
Why don't keep the light source with us Leonardo? Yeah

2240
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:49,220
Recognize these symbols

2241
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:50,420
No

2242
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:56,580
Wait, these are the symbols that were shown to me by the apple of Eden. They are in the wrong order

2243
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:59,540
Bacon stream when oh

2244
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,340
If you want

2245
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:11,860
I don't remember any of this

2246
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:19,220
I like smiling like an idiot

2247
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:23,940
Wait

2248
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:28,660
I

2249
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:41,780
Is this the room

2250
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:50,980
Those are not Pythagorean symbols

2251
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:54,180
43 39

2252
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:56,740
19 n

2253
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:59,220
75 27 42

2254
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:02,660
W

2255
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:06,180
I miss Brian

2256
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,460
The number is meaningless

2257
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,980
You are leaving it's not for

2258
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,300
It's for Desmond

2259
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:24,660
I must be in the chair that I go. It's the the vault and assassins creed three locations

2260
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:29,140
What are you not telling me?

2261
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:37,060
Well, I have begun several dissection studies. Oh my god. It's for dance man

2262
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:42,900
Oh my god, I literally have tears in my eyes. That's so cool

2263
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:45,460
Salah you would model for it again, of course

2264
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:49,940
Then perhaps I will study a woman with gentle and see how her body changes

2265
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:52,100
Interesting

2266
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:53,700
Tell me more

2267
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,700
No fucking AC

2268
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,700
When his body's all mangled, it's where they take him

2269
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:05,300
You can sedate Desmond now. Yes. Oh my god. It all makes sense

2270
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:11,780
Yes, and then you're broken in revelations

2271
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,900
Oh

2272
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:18,100
Oh my god, I get it. I understand

2273
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:22,020
Ah

2274
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:29,060
That's right. Oh my god, it's like all clicking like a like, uh, uh

2275
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:37,700
Oh my god, that's so cool and revelations Desmond's broken. You're stuck in the animus

2276
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:41,860
And they can't take you out because you're so mangled

2277
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:51,700
And it's you understand that he's a vessel for Desmond to get information in present day. It's absolutely crazy

2278
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,500
Oh, that's so cool

2279
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:00,580
That's so cool

2280
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:04,420
Oh spoilers. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just like I'm like re

2281
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:09,300
Like putting it all back in my head because I've played brotherhood over and over and over

2282
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,580
But I didn't always have access to the dlc's whenever I played them

2283
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:18,980
And then it's all clicking in Assassin's Creed revelations. You're mangled in the animus

2284
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:29,140
And we had to go like in present day your dad William takes like Desmond's dad William takes him to the thingy

2285
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:35,780
To that location because it's a safe haven and it's where one of the gods

2286
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:39,620
Uh, like the building things were and

2287
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:43,540
Ah, it's just so cool. It's so cool

2288
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,700
Oh

2289
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,300
Desmond's stuck in the mangled in the animus

2290
01:57:55,300 --> 01:58:01,540
I have no idea who Desmond is but i'm happy you're happy. So we're playing xio Desmond is his and

2291
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,500
I

2292
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:10,820
Like blood lineage offspring and we use Desmond's dna in present day to look back at xio in the past

2293
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:16,660
Christina oh, we just jump scared our oops

2294
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:33,860
Of nothing

2295
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:44,020
My father kept asking me to choose I thought I would never see you again

2296
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:50,660
It's manfredo he's going to kill him what?

2297
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:56,820
In tally he lost money. He's dragged them out to the end of the new bridge. Who the hell is manfredo?

2298
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:00,260
No

2299
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:06,580
Save christina's fiance manfredo from the freaking gamblers

2300
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:12,420
I'll have a freaking minute. No. I'm just gonna let him perish so I can take christina away with me

2301
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:18,260
Come on. You've got anyone to hang a bit with look. I've got 10 k florns on my person's christina. You just come with me

2302
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:24,420
You want to lay let him perish to the gambas

2303
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:28,020
Do not gamble

2304
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:33,380
Do I kill oh I kill okay, let's do it

2305
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:38,180
Sorry mate, but your time's up

2306
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:42,180
Wait I have assassin signals that's not right

2307
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:52,180
Oh no, I'm so sorry. What?

2308
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:05,940
The woman you're about to marry. Yes, I do. Hey, I swear I do kill me here and I will die still loving her

2309
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:08,420
You are never going to gamble again

2310
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,580
Never the same

2311
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:12,580
You will be a good husband to her

2312
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:18,020
Oh, why is this game so sad? What the heck?

2313
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:24,740
I can't handle this

2314
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:30,740
All right, she's a wee bit of a slag, but it's fine

2315
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:36,340
Wait, it feels really not going like I know like he never ended up with her because of revelations

2316
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:40,100
But why is this game so sad? Why can't it feel have a freaking happy ending?

2317
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:43,140
He tries so hard

2318
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:45,700
He's fine. He'll make a good husband

2319
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:48,660
I made sure oh

2320
02:00:49,940 --> 02:00:51,940
What

2321
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:54,740
Even christina's confused

2322
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:59,940
It's you you're supposed to take her away. You're supposed to whisk her away

2323
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:02,980
Oh

2324
02:01:02,980 --> 02:01:08,180
You're crying. I've got tears in my eyes. I'm just like can it's you have one like happy ending

2325
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:11,940
So I like I I'm really invested in it's your storyline

2326
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:18,500
I don't get it give this man catch a freaking break. Is that the end of christina's story?

2327
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,500
I don't see a broken heart on the map

2328
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:30,420
There is no way it ends there for chris christina

2329
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:34,260
I don't see a broken heart on the map

2330
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:43,780
That's it

2331
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:49,300
That's freaking it

2332
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:52,260
Oh

2333
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:55,860
You can't do this to me you be soft. Come on

2334
02:01:57,460 --> 02:02:01,780
Oh for folks that we're gonna have to do the plane. I don't want war machines now

2335
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:06,100
No happy ending for the best character literally like

2336
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:09,060
There must have been more written

2337
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:15,220
I'm so sorry, but I do not believe for a moment the development team ended it there for christina

2338
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:20,820
Literally it's you saving him from gamble and going do you love her?

2339
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:25,700
Do you love her and then that's it? I do not believe one second the writers left it there

2340
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:32,900
If there isn't more it must have been cut because I refuse. I refuse. I refuse

2341
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:50,100
But it's you will have a hell of a happy ending. I can't remember what happens at the end of revolutions

2342
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:56,980
I really did not play it as much like I know he was sweet on a girl and then she got kidnapped

2343
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:04,020
But that's not the true love christina was

2344
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:08,660
Like

2345
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:10,740
Ah

2346
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:18,020
They saved it for the 20 bucks DLC honestly, isn't that song misery was I have no idea

2347
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:21,780
I just if it remain

2348
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:28,100
Never my intention to brag it was never my intention to mine. Oh, I can probably renovate this aqueduct while I'm at it

2349
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,100
I'm like right next to it

2350
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:36,100
I mean, I don't know I simply saw it it took revelation

2351
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,700
I

2352
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:42,740
Took revelation. Look to this one. He if you want the christeners, you just get somebody's I feel sinking

2353
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:46,500
There's more wait. What's her DNA sink?

2354
02:03:47,380 --> 02:03:49,380
Uh 100

2355
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:53,220
Oh, that's very low in the batter on the va

2356
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:56,340
right

2357
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:58,340
Oh total sink

2358
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:00,500
Oh

2359
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:05,860
Okay, okay. I get you come on. I get you come on right. We're gonna do Leonardo. I think that brings up her total sink

2360
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:08,660
surely

2361
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:14,740
No, it doesn't it didn't we were like unfortunate right hold on hold on we're steamrolling this right in memory

2362
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:18,660
We only have one thing we failed. Do not drop below his

2363
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:23,540
Huh

2364
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:27,060
Is this this one where they jumped me out of nowhere from around the corner

2365
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:36,340
Okay, okay, let's try again. Oh, we're going to shoot him for that deja vu. Okay. We need 75 percent sick

2366
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:39,540
We need more. I just felt like that was such a bizarre thing to end on

2367
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:48,180
I think it's when the guys jumped me

2368
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:51,140
I

2369
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:56,100
I can't skip this

2370
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:01,060
Didn't know you could do all this in a sense people

2371
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:08,020
Uh she be is alive by the way for anyone who you would like to watch her

2372
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:11,460
Modes you have permission to speak

2373
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:15,060
momentarily

2374
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:19,620
Oh the music. Oh, okay, let's just play it all over again. Why not?

2375
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:36,260
So good

2376
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:39,140
Oh

2377
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:45,060
Left of it since the borja came to power

2378
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:49,460
He cannot see it from here

2379
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:57,380
Well, I had to google why the Christina mission wouldn't show up in my game. So you're welcome. Oh, literally

2380
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:02,100
First and only girl in the series. I still doesn't realize literally

2381
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:05,300
Okay

2382
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:10,180
So someone said I didn't take the medicine like a dum-dum dummy dum-dum-dum

2383
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:14,740
Jeez. Oh wow because I'm

2384
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:27,380
Okay, I know I'm replaying it. I didn't know it did it like this. I like fully armored up fully healed up

2385
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:33,220
Uh, okay, I'll take it. I'll take it

2386
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:37,620
Oh

2387
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:47,220
Okay, let's do this the totality. Hello, mr. Doctor may I please have oh my arm

2388
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:53,300
I need to find a doctor you're 100 health mate

2389
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:58,580
It's just faking it. Literally. He just needs a bit. Honestly felt that I needed a bit attention

2390
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:01,620
I felt that

2391
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:08,420
But they have not proven effective against such things

2392
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:16,100
However, I can recommend several good colleagues around the city. Do you need anything else? No, sir. Thank you very much for your help

2393
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:22,500
Right checkpoint reach of north

2394
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:28,020
I think it was the guards

2395
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:29,780
a

2396
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:31,780
The guards hit me

2397
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:36,180
Remember when the guard hit me around that corner? I think this entire section is for that

2398
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:43,620
I don't have climbing gloves. Okay, so I don't have what abilities I don't have at that time

2399
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:48,980
Chad doctor not prescribing leeches, honestly

2400
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:54,420
Right

2401
02:07:57,540 --> 02:07:59,540
Um

2402
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:02,340
Oh, what's my opinion on satan food? Hey

2403
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:05,540
It was a game. Yeah

2404
02:08:06,820 --> 02:08:10,820
Okay, it must have been because they hit me around the corner when I wasn't expecting that

2405
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:14,820
Literally arrow storm would wait this

2406
02:08:17,380 --> 02:08:19,380
Yeah, it was definitely because they hit me

2407
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:27,380
We'll try and finish Christina or maybe we should do Leonardo

2408
02:08:29,540 --> 02:08:32,580
It would be nice to finish Christina, but then we're having like backtrack all this way

2409
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:38,980
Right, what weapons? Okay. I do have my fast knife. So hopefully none of them like

2410
02:08:39,540 --> 02:08:42,500
fly out of the corner and attacked me because that was

2411
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:47,460
What happened the first time like they started attacking me way before we even got to the

2412
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:49,300
Gallo

2413
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:53,700
Which is where it's supposed to start. So I'll definitely hold back a bit more

2414
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:56,420
to be cautious

2415
02:08:56,820 --> 02:09:02,340
Like I didn't dislike Assassin's Creed 3. Well

2416
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:10,900
I wouldn't play it on stream though. Like I definitely wouldn't be like as excited and happy and all of that

2417
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:13,300
and I

2418
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:17,060
Really love how forgiving the counter controls are in brotherhood

2419
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:20,340
In revelations, I think it's roughly the same

2420
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:23,940
Um, but in Assassin's Creed 3 onwards

2421
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:28,660
They like change the controls and I am definitely if it's not broke

2422
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:33,300
Don't fix it. And if you fixed it, it has now made like gameplay

2423
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:40,020
Frustrating like I really strongly dislike when gameplay gets interrupted because of like

2424
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:46,340
Oopsie. Whoopsie. You forgot to dodge this attack. So now you're desynced and you have to repeat this over and over and over again

2425
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:53,220
Uh, because we've changed the controls and we knew for a fact that the controls on brotherhood were received so well

2426
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:59,460
Because it's like our best well received game, you know, like that stuff just makes me perish

2427
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:07,380
Right, we're still gonna stay back. We're not quite at the gallows yet, but I don't want anyone reaching

2428
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:14,500
To attack me and I definitely have time to react if I've kind of got this distance on them

2429
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,500
Ah

2430
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:23,700
Sorry, excuse me. Pardon me come through

2431
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:32,180
All right, take your time. Actually I have smoke bombs. I'm wondering if that's probably the safest method maybe smoke bombing them

2432
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:35,140
If they turn on me

2433
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:41,380
Are we at the gallows yet? I'm like getting scared. I do not want to replay this

2434
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:46,180
If it's literally gonna be like this strike from okay here is where they kicked off

2435
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:52,100
I don't know if I should claim, you know that

2436
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:57,540
Whoa, that's okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

2437
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:02,660
I have access to all my long range. I am using it

2438
02:11:05,860 --> 02:11:09,940
Please citizen do not walk in front of the crossbow bolt my goodness

2439
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:14,340
Oh, wow, this is did I just

2440
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:24,020
Citizens, please do not walk in front of the crossbow ball. Okay. There we go done 100%

2441
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:26,100
Yeah

2442
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:30,740
Okay, this is so much easier. I did not realize we'd have access to the older weapons for this stuff as well

2443
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:33,540
This will make it easy

2444
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:36,660
That guy had a death wish literally like thank you for

2445
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:42,980
It's you did not kill civilians. Well because civilians certainly pop themselves off right. That's fine

2446
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:47,220
Uh double

2447
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:49,620
Oh, we've got one missing from this one as well

2448
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:52,580
Do not be detected while reducing to a right

2449
02:11:53,860 --> 02:11:57,140
That's like super easy. Why have I failed these ones?

2450
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:00,180
Fake game are clearly

2451
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:05,380
Uh, right

2452
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:10,900
Oh, I need to do the whole thing over again. Oh, it's okay

2453
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:15,220
I'm surprised to see you 10 out of 10 reeflings recommend strong for this reason

2454
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:21,460
Was this the game that had the terror defense? No, that was revelations

2455
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:27,620
She was super excited and borrowing them to a barrel

2456
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:34,580
That man is a traitor to our order your character design romance of mesmer from subnautica

2457
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:38,980
Is there mpc's in subnautica? I thought it was like you versus all that

2458
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:44,420
I know

2459
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:58,980
You run into guards. Well, oh, that's right. That's true. That's true. Really. Really. Yes. It's true

2460
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:02,980
The mesmer is a fish

2461
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:05,300
I'm a fish too. I'm a photo fish

2462
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:11,780
Oh, I didn't sink my my cheeky iPhone. Hold on. Let me calibrate myself right now

2463
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:20,820
Okay, I calibrated so now you can like really tell what I'm looking at you

2464
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:25,060
Okay, we will rock you for one

2465
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:31,220
It's a scary little fish that hypnotizes you stop is actually okay

2466
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:35,060
Maybe we will have to play subnautica didn't realize I was in the game

2467
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:42,180
There are mpc messages, okay

2468
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:45,220
that's cool

2469
02:13:45,620 --> 02:13:48,340
Right how much ammo? Oh, I need a restock ammo

2470
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:50,980
Okay, I'm actually going to do the

2471
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:56,260
Pouch upgrades so we can like hold a lot of stuff because the pouches increase

2472
02:13:56,820 --> 02:14:00,180
your ability to hold ammo like a lot more and

2473
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:05,940
It'll definitely help out in these kind of rewind situations

2474
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:15,860
Wait, you've never played subnautica?

2475
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:22,020
I don't remember. I think I've seen people play it. Which is why I say like I don't remember playing it

2476
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:24,180
um

2477
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:25,780
I'm in

2478
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:30,340
My tummy's wumbling. Okay. Okay. Okay after this one we go get food and fizzy juice

2479
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:41,060
Wow that would hurt

2480
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:50,580
We can play it together and stream as long as you guys hold my hands through subnautica because I have no concept for what to do

2481
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:53,300
My son Claudio has been injured they are going to shoot him

2482
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:58,340
Not if I shoot first get the others because I'm a I'm a quick shot

2483
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:08,820
I may not have an automatic, but I'll I'll do it anyway. Oh, whoa. Whoa. What are you doing?

2484
02:15:10,180 --> 02:15:12,180
Yeah, yeah

2485
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:14,340
Whoa, they're like destroying him

2486
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:17,060
Oh

2487
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:23,700
Why are you just accepting gunshots? Oh, okay. We did it. We did it quick. I'd run the guards. Can we hold hands anyway?

2488
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:28,100
Yeah, I subnautica multiplayer. Imagine if you guys can come in and help me

2489
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:31,460
Oh, we should have more games like that

2490
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:35,460
Uh, right. Don't get caught while reducing notoriety. I'd like to see you son

2491
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:43,860
Oh, my tummy's really yumbling. Whoa. That was a good switcheroo words. My stomach is really rumbling

2492
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:47,300
Okay

2493
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:52,100
As soon as I notice it all of a sudden it's a big problem, but I don't notice it for like hours on end

2494
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:57,700
Are you sure you guys aren't the one hypnotizing me because I'm starting to feel like it is going that way

2495
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:01,620
It's single player. Oh, that sucks. It would be so fun to play

2496
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:09,540
There is a mod but

2497
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,860
I don't know if I need like

2498
02:16:11,860 --> 02:16:15,380
Whoa, what's going on? There's like three groups here y'all shouldn't be inter clashing

2499
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:18,260
The tree someone's taking the tree

2500
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:24,020
Okay, okay, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Yeah, we're good. Yeah, not suspicious at all. Nope. Nope

2501
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:29,620
Mutual hypnotizing

2502
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:32,820
I'm stuck

2503
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:38,740
Okay, and then we quickly run ahead and then we don't get detected whilst reducing our notoriety

2504
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:44,020
Can I just say shout out to the word notoriety? You're so satisfying to say no, all right

2505
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:46,820
No

2506
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:51,780
The gods are looking for your word. Good one. I see there's subnautica and subnautica below

2507
02:16:52,100 --> 02:16:54,100
It would look into it and see which one

2508
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:58,260
Subnautica is easy when she spawn in just swim the deep part of the ocean

2509
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:01,460
Okay

2510
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:04,500
I've had it. Oh, I guess because I'm a colorful shed

2511
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:06,660
So straight down

2512
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:09,540
Right, don't be detected

2513
02:17:10,580 --> 02:17:12,580
Stinky stinky me got detected

2514
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:18,200
Okay, there's no guards here. So I'm sick. Hello. Goodbye

2515
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:22,340
Is it literally this easy

2516
02:17:23,060 --> 02:17:25,060
I know it is

2517
02:17:27,060 --> 02:17:29,860
Yeah, then go back to the thieves skill. Wow

2518
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:33,460
I suck at this game

2519
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:37,860
But it's okay if I suck because you swallow. Hey, oh

2520
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:41,460

02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:45,940
Oh, there's a horse waiting on me get back to level three

2522

Ready up bill say ready up giddy up giddy giddy. What strange word giddy up

2523
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:57,540
Any giddy uppers

2524
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:00,100
Did you know

2525
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:02,100
The hit no

2526
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:10,180
Oh, look around the eyes. Don't look in the eyes. Look look in the eyes. Don't look around the eyes. Not around the eyes. You're under

2527
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:14,260
That was ridiculous. That was funny

2528
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:17,540
Hello, love. Oh, babe

2529
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:22,660

2530
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:29,460
But you have nothing to fear from markie valley. I am sure of it. I'm a switch. Hey, I have you to thank

2531
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:31,700
Switch is probably

2532
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:36,180
Have a best of you believe markie valley remains loyal to the order. I trust you

2533
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:42,660
So what is one of the girls dm'd me on discord if someone's freaking account just blown up

2534
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:49,780
Oh

2535
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:54,900
One of the girls sent me my reeflings. They linked me the reeflings when I posted it in chat like a dumb dumb

2536
02:18:55,780 --> 02:18:59,220
Um, right. I can show you reeflings

2537
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:02,900
R E E F L I N G

2538
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:09,460
And then let's pick the picture

2539
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:14,100
Pretty pretty reefling. We're the heck did I just save the picture?

2540
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:16,820
Yeah, there you are

Look at my pretty pretty reeflings. Look at you. You're so adorable. You're just like mommy

2544
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:30,100
Look

2545
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:33,140
Look at us together. We both have our little tippy bits at the side

2546
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:39,700
And look at your front facing tentacles if you look really close. Look there's a little hit a little heart

2547
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:42,580
But these are my reeflings

2548
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:47,380
But frunk, I will tweet this out because I'm a dumb dumb and never tweeted it

2549
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:50,180
But you guys are adorable

2550
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:57,300
And you have a head nicotine patch on your head because we're addicted to each other. Don't worry. I've got one too hiding under my bangs

2551
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:00,340
um

2552
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:02,340
But yeah, this is you

2553
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:03,860
You have

2554
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:05,380
eight arms

2555
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:11,460
You might think you have eight legs, but actually we have eight arms a cephalopods

2556
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:20,500
Wait, so are we reefling or humans that you're hypnotizing so you can be a humanized version of a reefling

2557
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:25,700
So if you wanted to draw a human reefling you'd technically have like a nicotine patch on your head

2558
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:27,620
Um

2559
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:29,620
type thing if you wanted to be humanized

2560
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:33,540
But this is what you are. You're my perfect little reefing. You're quite small

2561
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:39,140
I can't remember your official height and centimeters, but you're a small baby. You're a small baby

2562
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:44,020
Um, your size is pretty accurate to the loading screen

2563
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:46,180
um

2564
02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:48,740
You can fit on my head and you can um

2565
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:53,780
Like fit under my armpit or in between my butt cheeks

2566
02:20:55,700 --> 02:21:03,700
Um and I can caress in love on you all I want and your um arms your front two arms

2567
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:08,900
You can make them nice and long if you need to for whatever nefarious acts we might be doing together

2568
02:21:09,300 --> 02:21:11,300
But you're you are very

2569
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:15,060
You can be very big if you want to be

2570
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:18,980
Yeah, this is you

2571
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:24,500
I will tweet it out after the stream because I can't believe I was a silly billy and forgot to show you what you looked like on debut

2572
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:28,660
I knew I was missing something over here, honestly, but that's who you're so cute

2573
02:21:29,060 --> 02:21:33,380
And look at you getting all angry like me. Oh, this is such a cute face. You're like, mm-hmm

2574
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:38,420
Mom, hey, mom, hey, it's been four days

2575
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:50,100
Okay, we finished this mission and then I'm gonna get my tummy rumbling

2576
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:53,700
Now that you and I are working together, I would like to know what you think

2577
02:21:54,020 --> 02:21:56,500
Reef flings and a manifold stay away

2578
02:21:57,380 --> 02:21:59,700
Perhaps it would look like an E unless I miss something

2579
02:22:00,660 --> 02:22:03,700
Sometimes all the guy needs to feel cute in his subtleties a little

2580
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:09,700
Cephalopod that looks like him. Wait, the quest is still going. Talk to the architect. Oh wait

2581
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:15,380
We'll finish this. No stop summoning the horse. We did that last time as well

2582
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:18,900
Mummy give me I'm bro

2583
02:22:19,220 --> 02:22:21,220
Actually, do you know that really funny?

2584
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:23,940
Japanese meme where that guy looks like oh

2585
02:22:24,740 --> 02:22:27,620
He's perishing and then the girl's like smiling and all smug

2586
02:22:27,940 --> 02:22:32,340
I want to do that. And then like I've got I'm bro on the side to like perk you up again

2587
02:22:32,980 --> 02:22:35,460

2591
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:48,580
But like I'm like, yeah, I want to commission this artwork and then this artwork of this

Ah, yes, I forgot. We also have gambling. Wait, do you mean the guy in bed like drained him thin?

2595
02:23:04,580 --> 02:23:09,140
Like the girl looks smug and I think there's a rapper in the meme

2596
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:15,860
And she looks so smug and he's like oh and death looking like he's being trained

2597

There are so many anime. There are so many anime edits to

2606
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:06,260
She's doing peace sign

2607

1498 or something like that right on the cusp of

2614
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:06,980
Do you have ammo in here? Or is it the other place that has ammo?

2615
02:25:08,660 --> 02:25:13,780
It's you that has oh wait, we know I should buy the pouches first and then go buy the ammo. Yes

2616
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:16,820
That is a smart decision. Please do that. I will

2617
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:22,740
Get on you. Oh, uh, one of the challenges is to grab a guard

02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:54,260
I'm trying my best not to take too much fall damage trying to get to this place

2680
02:30:55,540 --> 02:30:57,540
We don't

2681
02:30:58,260 --> 02:31:04,180
Uh, when guys have slumber parties they do soggy biscuit when girls have slumber parties

2682
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:06,660
Oh

2683
02:31:09,540 --> 02:31:11,540
Where the heck am I trying to go?

2684
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:16,740
Sorry, you guys are distracting me. Stop being so entertaining

2685

Stop being so nice to me and gets me so distracted from the gameplay

2686

I've been told that I inherited my supposed to be very nice

2687
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:32,740
From my mother's side of the family. Oh, well, do you want to know?

2688
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:35,460
What's funny?

2689

Do you want to know what cup size my bazongas are?

2693
02:31:47,860 --> 02:31:51,300

02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:02,180
Don't know where they went literally

2697
02:32:03,220 --> 02:32:05,220
You know it all went to my butt instead

2698
02:32:06,340 --> 02:32:08,340
so

2699
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:11,300

02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:15,780
You got your yiddies from your father, honestly

2701
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:20,020
When can we get mum on stream?

2702

2704
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:27,860
um

2705
02:32:27,860 --> 02:32:30,420
Like I remember when she got me a training bra

2706
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:35,700
Like so if you didn't know a training bra is like to get you used to wearing

2707
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:41,380
One because it's actually really uncomfortable. Like I know I know it doesn't sound like it's uncomfortable

2708
02:32:41,860 --> 02:32:43,860
But like having something to strap down

2709
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:46,580
moving parts

2710
02:32:46,580 --> 02:32:48,580
um, it's kind of cut

2711
02:32:48,980 --> 02:32:50,980
I

2712
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:55,140
How much am I missing? Is that like less than 500 Florence roughly?

2713
02:32:56,020 --> 02:32:56,980
Oh

2714
02:32:56,980 --> 02:33:00,740
Um, and like she got me one and I was like mum. What is this for?

2715
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:03,380
And she was like, oh well

2716
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:08,340
I've got big gibbers. So you're gonna get big gibbers as well. And I'm like, um, okay

2717
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:10,580
So like I start training and then nothing happened

2718
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:12,580
Oh

2719
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:27,460
No, not like a sports bra like just like a thin fabric to like get you used to it and then yeah, none hand

2720
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:31,060
None hand with me

2721
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:37,380
But I'm not mad like I quite like my

2722
02:33:38,100 --> 02:33:39,860
Uh aesthetic

2723
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:46,500
Some people like have struggles with their bodies, but I am really lucky because I I prefer being

2724
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:53,300
Uh, not having much up but having a lot down like I really like my body

2725
02:33:57,220 --> 02:33:59,300
Yeah, like small buddies don't get in the way either

2726
02:34:01,220 --> 02:34:06,660
Like all I hear like my mum will complain about like back pain and I'm like

2727
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:10,180
The only pain I get is like

2728
02:34:11,620 --> 02:34:13,860
I don't get any pain because of my physique

2729
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:19,460
I would say that sorry. I'm trying to like think and do things at the same time and it's not working out. Um

2730
02:34:20,580 --> 02:34:22,580
I would say like

2731
02:34:22,980 --> 02:34:28,340
My physique just means like I'm always good to go basically

2732
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:32,260
Uh, right when we do another dna

2733
02:34:33,220 --> 02:34:37,940
Do you know bro, but do you know? Okay, there's quite a lot. Um, oh

2734
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,060
Oh no, only two only two

2735
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:46,500
Castlecrasher, no, I don't want to do you the burdens we carry

2736
02:34:47,220 --> 02:34:50,500
No, I don't want to do you either right. I'm gonna avoid any don't be

2737
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:54,980
I can do it in this one. I know how to do that one

2738
02:34:54,980 --> 02:34:56,980
I

2739
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:02,260
So I just went on a massive ramble about that

2740
02:35:03,860 --> 02:35:08,500
Milk milk and dump truck as I go. Oh mini milk is uh, yeah mini milk

2741
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:11,860
Oh, no, we don't have our assassin recruits

2742
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:15,780
But we should at this point

2743
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:18,740
Hmm

2744
02:35:19,140 --> 02:35:21,140
It's going to be a bit painful

2745
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:26,340
At the meeting find them on the computer wait, where are you gonna get some food? Oh, I was

2746
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:30,340
Okay, we'll do it after this one. See you guys distracted me

2747
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:33,620
They alert

2748
02:35:33,780 --> 02:35:35,780
You feed

2749
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:38,500
I forgot to get up

2750
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:42,420
Wait, I have one assassin recruit thing

2751
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:46,340
Is that because I only had one at the tank?

2752
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:48,900
Oh

2753
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:51,460
Oh, no, it's because they're all away on missions right now

2754
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:56,580
Okay, so if my assassins are way on missions, they're not available during recall that's

2755
02:35:57,860 --> 02:36:01,860
Yeah, I understand that's probably like programming would have been a nightmare

2756
02:36:02,580 --> 02:36:06,340
So, yeah, no, that makes sense. Okay. I won't send my recruits away too much anymore

2757
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:12,740
If that is the result I can send away the lower level ones because they do not count for the assassin signal

2758
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:15,540
I'm just gonna do this right now. I'm pretty sure it'll count

2759
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:19,220
towards my hiring the

2760
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:22,420
to lure the guards

2761
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:37,860
At the end of every week each one of us I'm starting to get lightheaded oopsies should have got some food

2762
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:48,420
Yeah, you put everyone else on quest literally

2763
02:36:49,620 --> 02:36:54,180
I need to go around and find all these gestures. I don't know what happens at the end of the gesture

2764
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:57,220
Thing like they're getting money or just something happened

2765
02:36:58,900 --> 02:37:00,900
Wait, is that senator?

2766
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:06,260
I'm wondering should I stall right now so all my recruits come back for this mission

2767
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:12,660
Right. Yes, we're going to do that. That's probably the best idea right now. So I don't mess up this mission

2768
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:16,340
I'm actually going to go out of range just so the event doesn't trigger

2769
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:18,980
and

2770
02:37:19,220 --> 02:37:22,260
Please get off. There we go. We're just hiding here. Why not?

2771
02:37:23,620 --> 02:37:26,500
I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to get a drink as well

2772
02:37:26,900 --> 02:37:29,620
Oh, did you see that street performer fall over there? Oh dear

2773
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:35,300
I'm going to go for pee and please do get up and hydrate and stretch your legs

2774
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:39,300
Because we do not have hemorrhoids in the reefing gang

2775
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:44,260
Hey, I'll be back very shortly. Literally. I just need to like put it all in a bowl and then

2776
02:37:45,060 --> 02:37:47,060
Uh, that's it really

2777
02:37:47,620 --> 02:37:49,620
I don't recall if I need to do anything else

2778
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:52,580
Maybe make a hot water bottle because I'm a bit chilly

2779
02:37:53,300 --> 02:37:56,420
Bit chilly. Right. I'll be I'll be like couple of minutes

2780
02:38:09,300 --> 02:38:12,740
I would hide there

2781
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:17,860
He could be in here

2782
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:26,340
Hey, you'll need a beating

2783
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:42,020
Oh

2784
02:39:39,300 --> 02:40:09,300
I think it's a good idea to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

2785
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:15,440
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of of a little neutralization.

2786
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:41,300
Come on and play.

2787
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:11,300
You want to take a picture?

2788
02:43:39,300 --> 02:44:07,300
Were we not in a haybill when I left?

2789
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:09,300
Am I going crazy? Did I not put myself in?

2790
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:11,300
Let's see if I can just go play on his own there.

2791
02:44:11,300 --> 02:44:13,300
And break the fourth wall.

2792
02:44:17,300 --> 02:44:19,300
My god, the shuby stream is hilarious.

2793
02:44:19,300 --> 02:44:21,300
Hell yeah, it's how you go watch her.

2794
02:44:21,300 --> 02:44:25,300
I could have sworn I was in that haybill, but whatever.

2795
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:27,300
You were, a guard shoved me out.

2796
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:29,300
I got bullied.

2797
02:44:29,300 --> 02:44:31,300
Yes, all your florns.

2798
02:44:31,300 --> 02:44:33,300
How dare you.

2799
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:35,300
A guard attacked me. How am I alive?

2800
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:37,300
Did the mission just reset?

2801
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:39,300
Right.

2802
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:43,300
I can see that I've got three sassan signals.

2803
02:44:43,300 --> 02:44:47,300
So this is going to make things a heck of a lot easier.

2804
02:44:47,300 --> 02:44:53,300
I completely forgot I bought chocolate covered raisins.

2805
02:44:53,300 --> 02:44:55,300
And I have chocolate covered raisins.

2806
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:57,300
And I'm sorry, I had.

2807
02:44:57,300 --> 02:44:59,300
No more arguing.

2808
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:01,300
Your bill has come to you.

2809
02:45:01,300 --> 02:45:03,300
They just pushed me out, I guess.

2810
02:45:03,300 --> 02:45:05,300
No, the banker sent us to play.

2811
02:45:05,300 --> 02:45:07,300
Make an exception for her own mind.

2812
02:45:07,300 --> 02:45:09,300
Momentarily.

2813
02:45:09,300 --> 02:45:11,300
Not good enough.

2814
02:45:11,300 --> 02:45:13,300
Right.

2815
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:19,300
Oh, am I allowed to be detected at this stage?

2816
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:23,300
Do not be detected while escorting the senator.

2817
02:45:23,300 --> 02:45:25,300
So I'm not escorting just yet.

2818
02:45:25,300 --> 02:45:27,300
I know I said that wrong, so I repeated it.

2819
02:45:27,300 --> 02:45:29,300
It seemed like I said on purpose, but the truth is I didn't.

2820
02:45:33,300 --> 02:45:37,300
I like how the senator couldn't, like, perfectly see through it.

2821
02:45:37,300 --> 02:45:39,300
By the way, sorry, I just know it's a mean tag in the reply.

2822
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:41,300
Under your schedule is Cephala Fogo.

2823
02:45:41,300 --> 02:45:43,300
Is that correct?

2824
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:45,300
Have I spelled it wrong?

2825
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:49,300
I probably spelled it wrong then.

2826
02:45:49,300 --> 02:45:53,300
This is what you guys need to tell me what to do.

2827
02:45:53,300 --> 02:45:55,300
Because I don't know what the heck I'm doing.

2828
02:45:55,300 --> 02:45:57,300
Friends these days.

2829
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:59,300
Unfortunately, I am not one of them.

2830
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:01,300
Cephala Fogo.

2831
02:46:01,300 --> 02:46:03,300
Cephala Fogo.

2832
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:05,300
He fights the guards and gives away money.

2833
02:46:05,300 --> 02:46:07,300
Where have you been all my life?

2834
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:09,300
We better get out of here.

2835
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:11,300
Cephala, please.

2836
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:13,300
So, honey, someone on Twitter made a VTuber food tier list

2837
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:15,300
and they put you in impressive.

2838
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:17,300
Oh yeah, they like my fringe tipped.

2839
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:19,300
You're going to have to protect me though.

2840
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:21,300
Hold on, I'm taking a sipping to Nicola.

2841
02:46:21,300 --> 02:46:23,300
Did you guys get up and start to leave?

2842
02:46:25,300 --> 02:46:27,300
I'm so sorry.

2843
02:46:27,300 --> 02:46:29,300
I don't know what's going on with my tum tum.

2844
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:31,300
I'm having to take more painkillers,

2845
02:46:31,300 --> 02:46:33,300
but I'm having them with food,

2846
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:35,300
so it's not going to hurt me.

2847
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:37,300
I promise it's not going to hurt.

2848
02:46:37,300 --> 02:46:39,300
Not long.

2849
02:46:43,300 --> 02:46:45,300
Cephala Fogo, honestly.

2850
02:46:45,300 --> 02:46:47,300
I mean,

2851
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:49,300
I take a little nibble out.

2852
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:55,300
Oh, burp warning.

2853
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:57,300
I burp a lot when I eat.

2854
02:46:57,300 --> 02:46:59,300
So, please brace yourself.

2855
02:46:59,300 --> 02:47:01,300
If you're not...

2856
02:47:01,300 --> 02:47:03,300
Not that you're not into burping,

2857
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:05,300
but I understand that some people have been raised

2858
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:07,300
that burping is very rude,

2859
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:09,300
but I...

2860
02:47:11,300 --> 02:47:13,300
Oh, I liked her scream.

2861
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:19,300
Okay, if you look away,

2862
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:21,300
your assassin recruits will despawn faster.

2863
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:23,300
And then they'll

2864
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:25,300
start reloading quicker.

2865
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:29,300
Did you see the art of food?

2866
02:47:29,300 --> 02:47:31,300
Art.

2867
02:47:31,300 --> 02:47:33,300
I've been locked out of my Twitter.

2868
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:37,300
I keep getting locked out of it

2869
02:47:37,300 --> 02:47:39,300
to the point where it's inaccessible,

2870
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:41,300
and it keeps telling me to do these

2871
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:43,300
like, stupid capture thing.

2872
02:47:43,300 --> 02:47:45,300
And it keeps saying

2873
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:47,300
um...

2874
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:51,300
No?

2875
02:47:51,300 --> 02:47:53,300
Well, I did not

2876
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:55,300
see them at all.

2877
02:47:55,300 --> 02:47:57,300
Um...

2878
02:47:57,300 --> 02:47:59,300
So, it says like,

2879
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:01,300
verification complete, you're human.

2880
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:03,300
And then it says,

2881
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:05,300
error submitting.

2882
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:07,300
I can't do anything.

2883
02:48:07,300 --> 02:48:09,300
I don't know what I want to do.

2884
02:48:09,300 --> 02:48:11,300
Um...

2885
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:13,300
So, I've been locked out of my

2886
02:48:13,300 --> 02:48:15,300
alt one.

2887
02:48:15,300 --> 02:48:17,300
I've not had a chance to check out

2888
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:19,300
my current one.

2889
02:48:19,300 --> 02:48:21,300
That is the music so loud in my ears.

2890
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:23,300
Sorry, I need to turn my headset down.

2891
02:48:23,300 --> 02:48:25,300
I'm gonna have to get this stage.

2892
02:48:31,300 --> 02:48:33,300
There we go.

2893
02:48:33,300 --> 02:48:35,300
They're gang violence and I'm right now.

2894
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:37,300
Barpeous, more wind.

2895
02:48:37,300 --> 02:48:39,300
Um, am I allowed to confess

2896
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:41,300
I've already recorded it?

2897
02:48:41,300 --> 02:48:43,300
I sat in my recording booth

2898
02:48:43,300 --> 02:48:45,300
for 15 minutes.

2899
02:48:45,300 --> 02:48:47,300
I had one bottle of water

2900
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:49,300
and one can of cola, and I felt ill

2901
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:51,300
after recording it.

2902
02:48:51,300 --> 02:48:53,300
But, I already recorded it.

2903
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:55,300
I'm so sorry.

2904
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:57,300
If it's not your thing.

2905
02:48:57,300 --> 02:48:59,300
But, it's the truth.

2906
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:01,300
I already recorded it.

2907
02:49:03,300 --> 02:49:05,300
I thought it was funny.

2908
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:07,300
But, I don't really have manners.

2909
02:49:07,300 --> 02:49:09,300
I was raised in a barium.

2910
02:49:11,300 --> 02:49:13,300
I've just gone...

2911
02:49:13,300 --> 02:49:15,300
Oh, management

2912
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:17,300
unlocked my alternative twitter.

2913
02:49:17,300 --> 02:49:19,300
Okay, I'll go. I'll look after stream.

2914
02:49:19,300 --> 02:49:21,300
And then I'll see what I've missed

2915
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:23,300
because I think it's very possible

2916
02:49:23,300 --> 02:49:25,300
I've missed a lot of fanarts or clips.

2917
02:49:25,300 --> 02:49:27,300
Someone clipped me.

2918
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:29,300
Plain Assassin's Creed.

2919
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:31,300
Someone clipped me

2920
02:49:33,300 --> 02:49:35,300
when me and the horse

2921
02:49:35,300 --> 02:49:37,300
were beating up the captain.

2922
02:49:37,300 --> 02:49:39,300
I was like giggling my little

2923
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:41,300
bottle off at the cliff. It was so good.

2924
02:49:41,300 --> 02:49:43,300
I'm gonna tweet it out

2925
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:45,300
because like it was just so funny.

2926
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:47,300
I really appreciate anyone that clips me

2927
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:49,300
because clipping takes so much time.

2928
02:49:49,300 --> 02:49:51,300
How long will the audio be?

2929
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:53,300
I think it's roughly 15 minutes

2930
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:55,300
after editing because

2931
02:49:55,300 --> 02:49:57,300
I'm doing a lot of

2932
02:49:57,300 --> 02:49:59,300
what I call live ASMR

2933
02:49:59,300 --> 02:50:01,300
where I don't edit out all my mistakes

2934
02:50:01,300 --> 02:50:03,300
and stuff.

2935
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:05,300
I know this sounds a bit funny

2936
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:07,300
saying it like that.

2937
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:09,300
But...

2938
02:50:09,300 --> 02:50:11,300
But...

2939
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:17,300
Sorry.

2940
02:50:17,300 --> 02:50:19,300
What was the name?

2941
02:50:19,300 --> 02:50:21,300
I'm sorry.

2942
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:23,300
My brain's too small to think and talk and play at the same time.

2943
02:50:23,300 --> 02:50:25,300
Oh, yeah.

2944
02:50:25,300 --> 02:50:27,300
Live ASMR.

2945
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:29,300
I've really been enjoying doing it.

2946
02:50:29,300 --> 02:50:31,300
Instead of the super hyper edited approach

2947
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:33,300
if I make a bump

2948
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:35,300
then I just lower the volume

2949
02:50:35,300 --> 02:50:37,300
so it's still acceptable for ASMR

2950
02:50:37,300 --> 02:50:39,300
at one point my cat

2951
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:41,300
came in

2952
02:50:41,300 --> 02:50:43,300
my recording booth

2953
02:50:43,300 --> 02:50:45,300
and I was like, do you want to do ASMR with me?

2954
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:47,300
And my baby boy was like

2955
02:50:47,300 --> 02:50:49,300
so I'm just like gonna leave it in

2956
02:50:49,300 --> 02:50:51,300
because it's just so precious

2957
02:50:51,300 --> 02:50:53,300
and I really like it.

2958
02:50:55,300 --> 02:50:57,300
I've really

2959
02:50:57,300 --> 02:50:59,300
enjoyed doing live ASMR

2960
02:50:59,300 --> 02:51:01,300
instead of like try hard even more.

2961
02:51:03,300 --> 02:51:05,300
I've done like

2962
02:51:05,300 --> 02:51:07,300
scripted ones as well

2963
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:09,300
where I'm rambling out my butt

2964
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:11,300
like so much.

2965
02:51:13,300 --> 02:51:15,300
If it's not scripted

2966
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,300
my rambling ASMR is ridiculous.

2967
02:51:17,300 --> 02:51:19,300
Like it's not even ASMR honestly.

2968
02:51:19,300 --> 02:51:21,300
It's just me goofing off talking about whatever I like.

2969
02:51:21,300 --> 02:51:23,300
Um, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2970
02:51:25,300 --> 02:51:27,300
I've accidentally hired

2971
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:29,300
this group

2972
02:51:29,300 --> 02:51:31,300
when I'm...

2973
02:51:31,300 --> 02:51:33,300
How is the senator under attack?

2974
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:35,300
I don't even know how he's under attack.

2975
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:37,300
There's no one that patrols that way.

2976
02:51:37,300 --> 02:51:39,300
As long as I don't get discovered

2977
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:41,300
I could be

2978
02:51:41,300 --> 02:51:43,300
here. What happened?

2979
02:51:43,300 --> 02:51:45,300
We're addicted to the yapping.

2980
02:51:45,300 --> 02:51:47,300
Where can I hear the ASMR? It'll just be on YouTube.

2981
02:51:47,300 --> 02:51:49,300
I do need to edit it. I've got a few things first before

2982
02:51:49,300 --> 02:51:51,300
I start doing my

2983
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:53,300
1000 subscriber

2984
02:51:53,300 --> 02:51:55,300
thank you ASMRs.

2985
02:51:55,300 --> 02:51:57,300
Like I've got a few collabs that I need to focus on first.

2986
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:59,300
Like I really, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2987
02:51:59,300 --> 02:52:01,300
Why did all of that...

2988
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:03,300
Did I not

2989
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:05,300
perish you guys?

2990
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:09,300
Can you look at those

2991
02:52:09,300 --> 02:52:11,300
guards maybe?

2992
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:15,300
Okay, there we go.

2993
02:52:15,300 --> 02:52:17,300
They're gonna fight each other.

2994
02:52:17,300 --> 02:52:19,300
Wait, what?

2995
02:52:19,300 --> 02:52:21,300
Yeah, so this is true.

2996
02:52:21,300 --> 02:52:23,300
Taser ASMR unlocked by she-

2997
02:52:23,300 --> 02:52:25,300
What? Is she doing ASMR right now?

2998
02:52:27,300 --> 02:52:29,300
But yeah, my rambling ASMR

2999
02:52:29,300 --> 02:52:31,300
always end up, like non-script

3000
02:52:31,300 --> 02:52:33,300
always end up in a massive ramble. That's not even ASMR.

3001
02:52:33,300 --> 02:52:35,300
There's so many things in it

3002
02:52:35,300 --> 02:52:37,300
because at one point during one of them

3003
02:52:37,300 --> 02:52:39,300
I was like, do you want to listen to how much

3004
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:41,300
ASMR tools are on the floor right now?

3005
02:52:41,300 --> 02:52:43,300
And like I kick my feet around the mic

3006
02:52:43,300 --> 02:52:45,300
and stuff so you can hear it.

3007
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:47,300
It's just a scene.

3008
02:52:47,300 --> 02:52:49,300
Am I silly Billy, honey?

3009
02:52:51,300 --> 02:52:53,300
Wait, whatever.

3010
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:55,300
100%

3011
02:52:55,300 --> 02:52:57,300
We get Taser in

3012
02:52:57,300 --> 02:52:59,300
the actual Taser.

3013
02:53:01,300 --> 02:53:03,300
She's trying to make an ASMR game.

3014
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:09,300
What did you want again?

3015
02:53:09,300 --> 02:53:11,300
Like I did an ear cleaning thing.

3016
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:13,300
Like an ear cleaning role-play.

3017
02:53:13,300 --> 02:53:15,300
And like the first sentence I said

3018
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:17,300
was like, oh, the STD clinic's down to the left, mate.

3019
02:53:17,300 --> 02:53:19,300
I was like, oh, you're here for your ear cleaning.

3020
02:53:19,300 --> 02:53:21,300
I'm gonna start cleaning your ears.

3021
02:53:21,300 --> 02:53:23,300
Like I'm just...

3022
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:25,300
I don't know why, I'm just like having such a good time.

3023
02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:27,300
She said drunk ASMR.

3024
02:53:27,300 --> 02:53:29,300
Oh, she's drinking, I hope she's careful.

3025
02:53:35,300 --> 02:53:37,300
Okay, I'm gonna eat my egg and meat

3026
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:39,300
because

3027
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:41,300
I don't like

3028
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:43,300
when

3029
02:53:43,300 --> 02:53:45,300
eggs are out of the fridge.

3030
02:53:45,300 --> 02:53:47,300
I don't want to get sick.

3031
02:53:47,300 --> 02:53:49,300
So, eggy and meat stick.

3032
02:53:51,300 --> 02:53:53,300
Oh, she's steaming.

3033
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:55,300
Oh, is she steaming?

3034
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:59,300
Oh my god, did you hear the egg just bite me back?

3035
02:53:59,300 --> 02:54:01,300
It's just full of the money.

3036
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:05,300
I can do that one easy.

3037
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:07,300
Easy.

3038
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:09,300
But I can 100% this one.

3039
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:11,300
I just bugged it.

3040
02:54:11,300 --> 02:54:13,300
Bugged it.

3041
02:54:21,300 --> 02:54:23,300
It's so good.

3042
02:54:23,300 --> 02:54:25,300
It's so easy to make as well.

3043
02:54:25,300 --> 02:54:27,300
It's literally boiled egg.

3044
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:29,300
I look forward to this drunk ASMR.

3045
02:54:29,300 --> 02:54:31,300
Shibi's doing it right now.

3046

Please consider supporting Shibi Cottonbomb.

3048
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:37,300
She's doing live drunk ASMR.

3049
02:54:41,300 --> 02:54:43,300
Shibi, how's it going?

3050
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:45,300
We're trying to finish Christina's frickin' story line.

3051
02:54:49,300 --> 02:54:51,300
There we go.

3052
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:53,300
Bancum on the way home.

3053
02:55:03,300 --> 02:55:05,300
I'm a bit worried.

3054
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:07,300
I don't have a napkin again

3055
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:09,300
and I've just touched egg.

3056
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:11,300
I'll just wipe it on my hoodie.

3057
02:55:11,300 --> 02:55:13,300
Sorry, I'm gross but it's true.

3058
02:55:15,300 --> 02:55:17,300
Look at Emmy's alt.

3059
02:55:17,300 --> 02:55:19,300
Bancum.

3060
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:23,300
Can I see it?

3061
02:55:23,300 --> 02:55:25,300
Can I see it?

3062
02:55:25,300 --> 02:55:27,300
See it?

3063
02:55:27,300 --> 02:55:29,300
I think I'm following it on the memes.

3064
02:55:39,300 --> 02:55:41,300
Where is it?

3065
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:47,300
Is it hidden?

3066
02:55:47,300 --> 02:55:49,300
And you can't see it

3067
02:55:49,300 --> 02:55:51,300
unless you search up for it?

3068
02:55:59,300 --> 02:56:01,300
Where the heck are you?

3069
02:56:01,300 --> 02:56:03,300
Oh, there it is.

3070
02:56:03,300 --> 02:56:05,300
I got it. What did she post?

3071
02:56:05,300 --> 02:56:07,300
Oh, her tummy hurt.

3072
02:56:07,300 --> 02:56:09,300
Is that what you mean?

3073
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:11,300
Do you have a favorite streamer snack?

3074
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:13,300
No.

3075
02:56:13,300 --> 02:56:15,300
Let's eat anything.

3076
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:17,300
Oh, why did I feel like I've heard it before, Strony?

3077
02:56:17,300 --> 02:56:19,300
I'm Strony Cuddles now

3078
02:56:19,300 --> 02:56:21,300
and I'd like to remain Strony Cuddles.

3079
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:23,300
Thank you very much.

3080
02:56:25,300 --> 02:56:27,300
Underneath the tummy hurt message.

3081
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:29,300
Me when I can't kiss you 600 times a day.

3082
02:56:35,300 --> 02:56:37,300
The retweet or her tweet?

3083
02:56:37,300 --> 02:56:39,300
Tight.

3084
02:56:41,300 --> 02:56:43,300
You up and whispering in your ear

3085
02:56:43,300 --> 02:56:45,300
that if you can make it to 30 seconds

3086
02:56:45,300 --> 02:56:47,300
without I'll reward you.

3087
02:56:47,300 --> 02:56:49,300
As fast as you can.

3088
02:56:49,300 --> 02:56:51,300
I'm watching you struggle not to.

3089
02:56:51,300 --> 02:56:53,300
But in the end, you'll still fail.

3090
02:56:57,300 --> 02:56:59,300
Please give me a kiss with what?

3091
02:57:01,300 --> 02:57:03,300
Oh, I never read the full thing.

3092
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:05,300
I just read that her tummy hurt.

3093
02:57:05,300 --> 02:57:07,300
Oh, my God.

3094
02:57:07,300 --> 02:57:09,300
Emmy.

3095
02:57:09,300 --> 02:57:11,300
That's outrageous.

3096
02:57:11,300 --> 02:57:13,300
That's so good.

3097
02:57:13,300 --> 02:57:15,300
Emmy.

3098
02:57:15,300 --> 02:57:17,300
That's funny as in.

3099
02:57:25,300 --> 02:57:27,300
You'll never guess what.

3100
02:57:27,300 --> 02:57:29,300
H.E. Girlfriend in my DMs.

3101
02:57:29,300 --> 02:57:31,300
I was right.

3102
02:57:31,300 --> 02:57:33,300
There's my clubs happening by hook or by crook.

3103
02:57:37,300 --> 02:57:39,300
I'm so bad with Twitter.

3104
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:41,300
I'm supposed to tweet like when I'm going live and stuff.

3105
02:57:43,300 --> 02:57:45,300
But I just can't even ball it.

3106
02:57:45,300 --> 02:57:47,300
I just can't even ball it with Twitter.

3107
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:49,300
It's for looking at pictures and then doing your thing

3108
02:57:49,300 --> 02:57:51,300
and then going off again, you know what I'm saying?

3109
02:57:53,300 --> 02:57:55,300
I only got to the tummy part.

3110
02:57:55,300 --> 02:57:57,300
No, I didn't read ahead.

3111
02:57:57,300 --> 02:57:59,300
I just saw that she had a sore tum tum.

3112
02:58:01,300 --> 02:58:03,300
Maybe like,

3113
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:05,300
all the girls run their own social media.

3114
02:58:05,300 --> 02:58:07,300
I told them do what you want.

3115
02:58:07,300 --> 02:58:09,300
Because like, I'm so bad.

3116
02:58:11,300 --> 02:58:13,300
I know you're supposed to tweet like oh, I'm going live.

3117
02:58:13,300 --> 02:58:15,300
I'm doing this in an hour.

3118
02:58:15,300 --> 02:58:17,300
And I'm like, I feel like those who want to be here

3119
02:58:17,300 --> 02:58:19,300
already know the drill.

3120
02:58:23,300 --> 02:58:25,300
But I do get that reminders are helpful.

3121
02:58:25,300 --> 02:58:27,300
And say I'm going to use it for like, oh,

3122
02:58:27,300 --> 02:58:29,300
my YouTube video for 1000 subscribers

3123
02:58:29,300 --> 02:58:31,300
is here. Take thing.

3124
02:58:33,300 --> 02:58:35,300
I don't miss the strong 10.

3125
02:58:35,300 --> 02:58:37,300
That's so good.

3126
02:58:37,300 --> 02:58:39,300
Self gatekeeping.

3127
02:58:49,300 --> 02:58:51,300
Are we going to react to the Xbox showcase stuff?

3128
02:58:53,300 --> 02:58:55,300
What's my stream on Sunday?

3129
02:58:55,300 --> 02:58:57,300
I don't know.

3130
02:58:59,300 --> 02:59:01,300
I can't, I think

3131
02:59:01,300 --> 02:59:03,300
my stream on Sunday is

3132
02:59:05,300 --> 02:59:07,300
the sweets.

3133
02:59:09,300 --> 02:59:11,300
Hmm.

3134
02:59:13,300 --> 02:59:15,300
Johnny is cute.

3135
02:59:15,300 --> 02:59:17,300
Cute. You're cute.

3136
02:59:17,300 --> 02:59:19,300
Reflink cute.

3137
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:23,300
Okay.

3138
02:59:23,300 --> 02:59:25,300
I shouldn't munch too much, but I'm so hungry.

3139
02:59:29,300 --> 02:59:31,300
Okay.

3140
02:59:31,300 --> 02:59:33,300
Born sweet.

3141
02:59:33,300 --> 02:59:35,300
Okay.

3142
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:37,300
Hmm.

3143
02:59:37,300 --> 02:59:39,300
I kind of plan to do like one endurance

3144
02:59:39,300 --> 02:59:41,300
game stream a week.

3145
02:59:41,300 --> 02:59:43,300
So next week is Skyrim for endurance.

3146
02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:45,300
Then we have Elden Ring

3147
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:47,300
for two weeks in a row

3148
02:59:47,300 --> 02:59:49,300
after that.

3149
02:59:49,300 --> 02:59:51,300
So I'm playing the DLC

3150
02:59:51,300 --> 02:59:53,300
with you guys first.

3151
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:55,300
And then I'm playing multiplayer

3152
02:59:55,300 --> 02:59:57,300
with sin sister.

3153
02:59:57,300 --> 02:59:59,300
Um.

3154
03:00:01,300 --> 03:00:03,300
And we also have shot callers

3155
03:00:03,300 --> 03:00:05,300
and heart rate winners and all that jazz.

3156
03:00:05,300 --> 03:00:07,300
Um.

3157
03:00:07,300 --> 03:00:09,300
Thankfully sin sister is an

3158
03:00:09,300 --> 03:00:11,300
endurance streamer. So like if you ever

3159
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:13,300
get annoyed like, uh

3160
03:00:13,300 --> 03:00:15,300
I hate it like when

3161
03:00:15,300 --> 03:00:17,300
streamers like don't finish a game.

3162
03:00:17,300 --> 03:00:19,300
I don't like it either.

3163
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:21,300
Which is why I would love to get

3164
03:00:21,300 --> 03:00:23,300
endurance streamers for Borderlands 2.

3165
03:00:23,300 --> 03:00:25,300
I would love to do a VTuber

3166
03:00:25,300 --> 03:00:27,300
playthrough like you know the VTubers.

3167
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:29,300
The problem is

3168
03:00:29,300 --> 03:00:31,300
if people aren't endurance streamers

3169
03:00:31,300 --> 03:00:33,300
that's like

3170
03:00:33,300 --> 03:00:35,300
so long.

3171
03:00:35,300 --> 03:00:37,300
Whereas if you can find endurance

3172
03:00:37,300 --> 03:00:39,300
it takes maybe three streams max.

3173
03:00:39,300 --> 03:00:41,300
If you want to just blast through the campaign

3174
03:00:41,300 --> 03:00:43,300
maybe even two honestly.

3175
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:45,300
Uh-huh.

3176
03:00:45,300 --> 03:00:47,300
Bye.

3177
03:00:55,300 --> 03:00:57,300
What?

3178
03:00:57,300 --> 03:00:59,300
I'm sucking my fingers.

3179
03:00:59,300 --> 03:01:01,300
I don't know why my tongue's coming out.

3180
03:01:01,300 --> 03:01:03,300
Oh it thinks my fingers are my tongue.

3181
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:05,300
Uh-huh.

3182
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:07,300
That's so cool.

3183
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:09,300
I love this.

3184
03:01:09,300 --> 03:01:11,300
I don't know if I've ever been

3185
03:01:11,300 --> 03:01:13,300
Borderlands 2 is like a hoot in a hole or

3186
03:01:13,300 --> 03:01:15,300
it's like a fun game honestly.

3187
03:01:21,300 --> 03:01:23,300
Oh maybe I should look at Marshmallow

3188
03:01:23,300 --> 03:01:25,300
while I do this.

3189
03:01:25,300 --> 03:01:27,300
Yes I will look at Marshmallow.

3190
03:01:27,300 --> 03:01:29,300
That's so silly.

3191
03:01:33,300 --> 03:01:35,300
Oh my goodness.

3192
03:01:35,300 --> 03:01:37,300
I have a hundred more questions

3193
03:01:37,300 --> 03:01:39,300
than I did yesterday.

3194
03:01:39,300 --> 03:01:41,300
Oops.

3195
03:01:41,300 --> 03:01:43,300
Any chance there will be a full body

3196
03:01:43,300 --> 03:01:45,300
pillow for sale in the future?

3197
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:47,300
Yes!

3198
03:01:47,300 --> 03:01:49,300
Uh-huh market

3199
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:51,300
are like absolutely amazing to work with

3200
03:01:51,300 --> 03:01:53,300
or like whenever a girl has a birthday

3201
03:01:53,300 --> 03:01:55,300
please tell us and we're happy

3202
03:01:55,300 --> 03:01:57,300
to do like a new thing for you.

3203
03:01:57,300 --> 03:01:59,300
Um so the more support

3204
03:01:59,300 --> 03:02:01,300
like they get on UwU market right now

3205
03:02:01,300 --> 03:02:03,300
the more favour we have

3206
03:02:03,300 --> 03:02:05,300
to like produce something new.

3207
03:02:05,300 --> 03:02:07,300
So for the girls' birthdays I would love

3208
03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:09,300
to do um

3209
03:02:09,300 --> 03:02:11,300
at least booba mouth

3210
03:02:11,300 --> 03:02:13,300
mouth mat

3211
03:02:13,300 --> 03:02:15,300
and

3212
03:02:15,300 --> 03:02:17,300
also possibly their mascots

3213
03:02:17,300 --> 03:02:19,300
in a plushie.

3214
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:21,300
I don't know if the designs for the mascots

3215
03:02:21,300 --> 03:02:23,300
might be a bit advanced

3216
03:02:23,300 --> 03:02:25,300
um or they would come out

3217
03:02:25,300 --> 03:02:27,300
quite expensive that's the only

3218
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:29,300
um issue.

3219
03:02:29,300 --> 03:02:31,300
Hi!

3220
03:02:31,300 --> 03:02:33,300
Good to hear you. Yeah it's good to be heard

3221
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:35,300
isn't it? Um

3222
03:02:35,300 --> 03:02:37,300
100% open to any merch.

3223
03:02:37,300 --> 03:02:39,300
We are going to establish ourselves first

3224
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:41,300
and then I'm going to reach out

3225
03:02:41,300 --> 03:02:43,300
to a very unique merch and dice

3226
03:02:43,300 --> 03:02:45,300
line because I have no idea

3227
03:02:45,300 --> 03:02:47,300
how to bridge a connection between that

3228
03:02:47,300 --> 03:02:49,300
for sure. You know you can only

3229
03:02:49,300 --> 03:02:51,300
do but ask. If you do not ask

3230
03:02:51,300 --> 03:02:53,300
you do not receive so I will ask

3231
03:02:53,300 --> 03:02:55,300
I will see if it's possible. If it's not possible

3232
03:02:55,300 --> 03:02:57,300
then we tried.

3233
03:02:57,300 --> 03:02:59,300
Um

3234
03:02:59,300 --> 03:03:01,300
would it be um

3235
03:03:01,300 --> 03:03:03,300
I'm not going to let you know what those type

3236
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:05,300
of mousepad designs would be for the others.

3237
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:07,300
I know what mine is

3238
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:09,300
my big badonkadonk.

3239
03:03:09,300 --> 03:03:11,300
I take a bite of my muffin

3240
03:03:11,300 --> 03:03:13,300
and

3241
03:03:13,300 --> 03:03:15,300
mmm

3242
03:03:15,300 --> 03:03:17,300
I'm just, hi strongy I really like the

3243
03:03:17,300 --> 03:03:19,300
Assassin's Creed streams. I wanted to give

3244
03:03:19,300 --> 03:03:21,300
you uh feedback that I've tipped in

3245
03:03:21,300 --> 03:03:23,300
the stream elements page around five times now

3246
03:03:23,300 --> 03:03:25,300
between the two streams

3247
03:03:25,300 --> 03:03:27,300
but it never came up!

3248
03:03:27,300 --> 03:03:29,300
Oh no!

3249
03:03:29,300 --> 03:03:31,300
Wait wait wait wait

3250
03:03:31,300 --> 03:03:33,300
why would it not come up?

3251
03:03:35,300 --> 03:03:37,300
Why would you get filtered?

3252
03:03:37,300 --> 03:03:39,300
I don't

3253
03:03:39,300 --> 03:03:41,300
I don't

3254
03:03:41,300 --> 03:03:43,300
It was broken before

3255
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:45,300
it's fixed now but why

3256
03:03:45,300 --> 03:03:47,300
would it not show up?

3257
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:51,300
I have bejinga narrow tiny

3258
03:03:51,300 --> 03:03:53,300
spiny and bejinga again

3259
03:03:53,300 --> 03:03:55,300
for today. It broke yesterday

3260
03:03:55,300 --> 03:03:57,300
please tell me

3261
03:03:57,300 --> 03:03:59,300
if your money didn't go through

3262
03:03:59,300 --> 03:04:01,300
or did go through.

3263
03:04:01,300 --> 03:04:03,300
The paper was broken because

3264
03:04:03,300 --> 03:04:05,300
you guys gave us so much money you broke the

3265
03:04:05,300 --> 03:04:07,300
cricket paper but it's unbroken

3266
03:04:07,300 --> 03:04:09,300
that's what's fun.

3267
03:04:09,300 --> 03:04:11,300
It is a legal requirement

3268
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:13,300
of all reeflings to love strongy stuff.

3269
03:04:15,300 --> 03:04:17,300
I also was

3270
03:04:17,300 --> 03:04:19,300
thinking

3271
03:04:19,300 --> 03:04:21,300
I need to find an artist to do this

3272
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:23,300
one that's good with all body types

3273
03:04:23,300 --> 03:04:25,300
I would love

3274
03:04:25,300 --> 03:04:27,300
for our six month anniversary

3275
03:04:27,300 --> 03:04:29,300
to have a mouse pad

3276
03:04:29,300 --> 03:04:31,300
of all of us together like one of

3277
03:04:31,300 --> 03:04:33,300
those big flat mouse pads

3278
03:04:33,300 --> 03:04:35,300
I would adore to have us

3279
03:04:35,300 --> 03:04:37,300
all together. I absolutely adore it

3280
03:04:41,300 --> 03:04:43,300
but I would need to get

3281
03:04:43,300 --> 03:04:45,300
a really good artist for that

3282
03:04:45,300 --> 03:04:47,300
I would not want to waste money

3283
03:04:47,300 --> 03:04:49,300
dicking around with an artist

3284
03:04:49,300 --> 03:04:51,300
I would want an artist to

3285
03:04:51,300 --> 03:04:53,300
smoke it

3286
03:04:55,300 --> 03:04:57,300
I would adore it

3287
03:04:59,300 --> 03:05:01,300
Since there's a notification discord server

3288
03:05:01,300 --> 03:05:03,300
would it be possible for you to

3289
03:05:03,300 --> 03:05:05,300
upload the unarchived stuff

3290
03:05:05,300 --> 03:05:07,300
to the discord like a thread

3291
03:05:07,300 --> 03:05:09,300
unarchived stuff?

3292
03:05:09,300 --> 03:05:11,300
Do you mean like karaoke stream or the ASMR stream

3293
03:05:11,300 --> 03:05:13,300
that went kapoot?

3294
03:05:13,300 --> 03:05:15,300
I think because

3295
03:05:15,300 --> 03:05:17,300
we shouldn't

3296
03:05:17,300 --> 03:05:19,300
really host it because I got taken off

3297
03:05:19,300 --> 03:05:21,300
so I don't want to be the ones

3298
03:05:21,300 --> 03:05:23,300
responsible

3299
03:05:23,300 --> 03:05:25,300
does that make sense?

3300
03:05:25,300 --> 03:05:27,300
Like archive annons shout out to archive annons

3301
03:05:27,300 --> 03:05:29,300
for saving everyone's butts

3302
03:05:29,300 --> 03:05:31,300
For me

3303
03:05:31,300 --> 03:05:33,300
I am open to suggestion if you don't like the suggestion

3304
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:35,300
please you're more than welcome to give me your opinion

3305
03:05:35,300 --> 03:05:37,300
again on Marshmallow but archive annons

3306
03:05:37,300 --> 03:05:39,300
if they broke don't fix it

3307
03:05:39,300 --> 03:05:41,300
they've been doing fantastic

3308
03:05:41,300 --> 03:05:43,300
they've been catching

3309
03:05:43,300 --> 03:05:45,300
what's been put out there and

3310
03:05:45,300 --> 03:05:47,300
hmm

3311
03:05:47,300 --> 03:05:49,300
hmm

3312
03:05:57,300 --> 03:05:59,300
Are alternative streams

3313
03:05:59,300 --> 03:06:01,300
going to be free to access? Yes I do

3314
03:06:01,300 --> 03:06:03,300
not personally

3315
03:06:03,300 --> 03:06:05,300
believe in paying more than

3316
03:06:05,300 --> 03:06:07,300
like 10 us dollars

3317
03:06:07,300 --> 03:06:09,300
to like fully support your oshi

3318
03:06:09,300 --> 03:06:11,300
and get everything that they put out there

3319
03:06:11,300 --> 03:06:13,300
and the girls have shown an interest

3320
03:06:13,300 --> 03:06:15,300
in playing alternative games

3321
03:06:15,300 --> 03:06:17,300
and doing some other stuff

3322
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:19,300
but I

3323
03:06:19,300 --> 03:06:21,300
would not

3324
03:06:21,300 --> 03:06:23,300
like them to charge for it

3325
03:06:23,300 --> 03:06:25,300
I'm going to say to them like let's not charge

3326
03:06:25,300 --> 03:06:27,300
but obviously I will never hold you back

3327
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:29,300
from giving any tips to the girls

3328
03:06:31,300 --> 03:06:33,300
you can always tip as a thank you

3329
03:06:33,300 --> 03:06:35,300
to content that you enjoy

3330
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:37,300
but that's with me

3331
03:06:37,300 --> 03:06:39,300
like someone said

3332
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:41,300
hmm

3333
03:06:41,300 --> 03:06:43,300
do I plan on raising

3334
03:06:43,300 --> 03:06:45,300
the prices of what's been established

3335
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:47,300
no I don't

3336
03:06:47,300 --> 03:06:49,300
I think

3337
03:06:49,300 --> 03:06:51,300
I think 10 us dollars per month for all the

3338
03:06:51,300 --> 03:06:53,300
content that the girls put out is fair

3339
03:06:53,300 --> 03:06:55,300
and I think it's

3340
03:06:55,300 --> 03:06:57,300
good value for money

3341
03:06:57,300 --> 03:06:59,300
and I think it also

3342
03:06:59,300 --> 03:07:01,300
shows that

3343
03:07:01,300 --> 03:07:03,300
like

3344
03:07:03,300 --> 03:07:05,300
the end goal isn't great and again

3345
03:07:05,300 --> 03:07:07,300
like 820 split comes into it type thing

3346
03:07:07,300 --> 03:07:09,300
and it goes up in their favour next year

3347
03:07:09,300 --> 03:07:11,300
type stuff if they want to hang about

3348
03:07:11,300 --> 03:07:13,300
like

3349
03:07:13,300 --> 03:07:15,300
I think if it's more than 10 us dollars

3350
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:17,300
you're

3351
03:07:17,300 --> 03:07:19,300
not taking the piss

3352
03:07:19,300 --> 03:07:21,300
but

3353
03:07:21,300 --> 03:07:23,300
I very much push for

3354
03:07:23,300 --> 03:07:25,300
value for money and

3355
03:07:25,300 --> 03:07:27,300
I hope

3356
03:07:27,300 --> 03:07:29,300
I know region

3357
03:07:29,300 --> 03:07:31,300
doesn't always

3358
03:07:31,300 --> 03:07:33,300
change the price of membership

3359
03:07:33,300 --> 03:07:35,300
regionally

3360
03:07:35,300 --> 03:07:37,300
which is obviously a big thing that's hard

3361
03:07:37,300 --> 03:07:39,300
to overcome

3362
03:07:39,300 --> 03:07:41,300
because we don't set the price

3363
03:07:41,300 --> 03:07:43,300
but if the website doesn't do

3364
03:07:43,300 --> 03:07:45,300
an alternative payment style

3365
03:07:45,300 --> 03:07:47,300
then

3366
03:07:47,300 --> 03:07:49,300
you're getting shafted in other countries

3367
03:07:49,300 --> 03:07:51,300
there is a

3368
03:07:51,300 --> 03:07:53,300
streamer that talked about selling games

3369
03:07:53,300 --> 03:07:55,300
and it was like oh

3370
03:07:55,300 --> 03:07:57,300
Brazil because they lowered the price

3371
03:07:57,300 --> 03:07:59,300
in Brazil like it was fine

3372
03:07:59,300 --> 03:08:01,300
and all that jazz

3373
03:08:01,300 --> 03:08:03,300
I'm sorry I'm rambling I'm not making any sense

3374
03:08:03,300 --> 03:08:05,300
um

3375
03:08:05,300 --> 03:08:07,300
by the way

3376
03:08:07,300 --> 03:08:09,300
cuddles I sometimes make a lot of clips

3377
03:08:09,300 --> 03:08:11,300
as you probably remember from back

3378
03:08:11,300 --> 03:08:13,300
then

3379
03:08:13,300 --> 03:08:15,300
are you goober?

3380
03:08:15,300 --> 03:08:17,300
we may be goober

3381
03:08:17,300 --> 03:08:19,300
I'm happy for you to use my clips

3382
03:08:19,300 --> 03:08:21,300
with whatever

3383
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:23,300
you want whenever but I would

3384
03:08:23,300 --> 03:08:25,300
prepare to keep the clips of you as

3385
03:08:25,300 --> 03:08:27,300
gay cats as possible

3386
03:08:27,300 --> 03:08:29,300
and I only share those with the reeflings really

3387
03:08:29,300 --> 03:08:31,300
and I post a group

3388
03:08:31,300 --> 03:08:33,300
clips of the other girls

3389
03:08:33,300 --> 03:08:35,300
I'm happy for the clips of the

3390
03:08:35,300 --> 03:08:37,300
other girls in the group clap to be used

3391
03:08:37,300 --> 03:08:39,300
to monetize the shoot oh that's so nice of you

3392
03:08:39,300 --> 03:08:41,300
whatever you want not like it really matters what my opinion is

3393
03:08:41,300 --> 03:08:43,300
yes it does you mean

3394
03:08:43,300 --> 03:08:45,300
you goober

3395
03:08:45,300 --> 03:08:47,300
and I would like to keep comfy streams

3396
03:08:47,300 --> 03:08:49,300
as long as possible while you go naturally

3397
03:08:49,300 --> 03:08:51,300
and share well I've got good

3398
03:08:51,300 --> 03:08:53,300
news for you

3399
03:08:53,300 --> 03:08:55,300
the nature of my

3400
03:08:55,300 --> 03:08:57,300
content gate creeps me automatically

3401
03:08:57,300 --> 03:08:59,300
do you want to hear why a little reefling

3402
03:08:59,300 --> 03:09:01,300
my goal of a ASMR

3403
03:09:01,300 --> 03:09:03,300
video every time

3404
03:09:03,300 --> 03:09:05,300
I get like 1000 subscribers

3405
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:07,300
the reason why that naturally

3406
03:09:07,300 --> 03:09:09,300
gate keeps me is because

3407
03:09:09,300 --> 03:09:11,300
someone will come into the live stream

3408
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:13,300
after consuming that content and they'll go

3409
03:09:13,300 --> 03:09:15,300
when ASMR, when ASMR stream

3410
03:09:15,300 --> 03:09:17,300
and then when they see me rambling

3411
03:09:17,300 --> 03:09:19,300
my head off about a 14 year old game

3412
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:21,300
having the time of my life

3413
03:09:21,300 --> 03:09:23,300
they're gonna get bored aren't they

3414
03:09:23,300 --> 03:09:25,300
they're only here for ASMR

3415
03:09:25,300 --> 03:09:27,300
5 head

3416
03:09:27,300 --> 03:09:29,300
I'm playing chess

3417
03:09:29,300 --> 03:09:31,300
and for D

3418
03:09:31,300 --> 03:09:33,300
already

3419
03:09:33,300 --> 03:09:35,300
I already did it myself

3420
03:09:35,300 --> 03:09:37,000
they're weak they can't

3421
03:09:37,300 --> 03:09:39,300
handle the scrawny they want the

3422
03:09:41,300 --> 03:09:43,300
they want the stealthy ASMR whisper in ear

3423
03:09:43,300 --> 03:09:45,300
they can't handle the rambling

3424
03:09:45,300 --> 03:09:47,300
they can't handle the accent they cannot handle the

3425
03:09:47,300 --> 03:09:49,300
errrr

3426
03:09:49,300 --> 03:09:51,300
so by default I naturally

3427
03:09:51,300 --> 03:09:53,300
gate keep myself you're welcome

3428
03:09:53,300 --> 03:09:55,300
love you reeflings, always had you in mind

3429
03:09:55,300 --> 03:10:05,060
Only the strongest roofling can survive on this level.

3430
03:10:05,060 --> 03:10:09,660
First time doing this, listen to your audio through- oh wait I don't think I can read this

3431
03:10:09,660 --> 03:10:10,660
one out loud.

3432
03:10:10,660 --> 03:10:11,660
It's a video link!

3433
03:10:11,660 --> 03:10:15,660
Oh am I watching that after this game?

3434
03:10:15,660 --> 03:10:18,220
Hey I did a Scottish game show.

3435
03:10:18,220 --> 03:10:21,180
Show them the name of places in Scotland and ask how to pronounce it.

3436
03:10:21,180 --> 03:10:23,660
That's such a good segment, love that idea.

3437
03:10:23,660 --> 03:10:28,740
I'm stealing it now, my idea now.

3438
03:10:28,740 --> 03:10:32,740
They tune into a stream expecting like a soft whisper with an accent.

3439
03:10:32,740 --> 03:10:36,580
I just sound like a bagpipe.

3440
03:10:36,580 --> 03:10:38,820
I can't handle the Scottish ramble.

3441
03:10:38,820 --> 03:10:41,220
Also check to see if you're still subscribed to the other girls, some have been called.

3442
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:45,780
Oh I saw that I was like really YouTube you're calling us after like literally a 12 hour

3443
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:46,780
stream.

3444
03:10:46,780 --> 03:10:47,780
Go and calm down.

3445
03:10:47,780 --> 03:10:49,540
It really should start to calm down now that we're streaming.

3446
03:10:49,540 --> 03:10:53,220
There is no way you're telling me like it's gonna keep continuing because this is getting

3447
03:10:53,260 --> 03:10:54,260
outrageous now.

3448
03:10:54,260 --> 03:10:56,620
Like I'm not laughing, no one's hee-hawing.

3449
03:10:56,620 --> 03:11:04,060
Strony it's not fair, you give the burp-huffer so much good stuff but what about the burp-huffer?

3450
03:11:04,060 --> 03:11:06,340
Oh stop it!

3451
03:11:06,340 --> 03:11:11,220
Is it terrible I have a Donothon reward where I took out my boot?

3452
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:17,340
There's a really funny ASMR outtake and I laugh and then it comes out more with my laugh

3453
03:11:17,340 --> 03:11:18,340
okay?

3454
03:11:18,340 --> 03:11:22,900
So I'm thinking about you, don't mean I'm necessarily- and I swear if anyone starts

3455
03:11:22,900 --> 03:11:29,180
complaining like oh my god it's literally just a 10 second audio clip of me laughing

3456
03:11:29,180 --> 03:11:30,700
and releasing air.

3457
03:11:30,700 --> 03:11:33,820
Like do you think I don't have a digestive tract?

3458
03:11:33,820 --> 03:11:38,820
Do you think that I'm- oh I'm such a gamer girl.

3459
03:11:38,820 --> 03:11:39,820
Ehehehe.

3460
03:11:39,820 --> 03:11:45,140
No I'm Scottish for one.

3461
03:11:45,140 --> 03:11:52,140
I take big Steven jobbies, no such thing as an idol meeting and my piss is neon.

3462
03:11:52,140 --> 03:11:57,180
Alright let's- no let's get it right, let's get it right, right off the bat I'm no having

3463
03:11:57,180 --> 03:11:58,180
none of this.

3464
03:11:58,180 --> 03:11:59,180
Eww you?

3465
03:11:59,180 --> 03:12:00,180
No.

3466
03:12:00,180 --> 03:12:06,780
I'm Strony, I'm Scottish and I was raised in a barn when they manners.

3467
03:12:06,780 --> 03:12:16,940
If a little 10 second audio clip of me laughing while I tout filters you, my guy.

3468
03:12:16,940 --> 03:12:19,580
Enjoy the oo-woo because that's what you're looking for, no me.

3469
03:12:19,580 --> 03:12:21,340
You're not looking for me.

3470
03:12:21,340 --> 03:12:26,180
And that's okay, if you're not looking for me I've got 3.3, I've got 5 adorable doors

3471
03:12:26,180 --> 03:12:28,180
waiting on you alright.

3472
03:12:28,180 --> 03:12:29,180
Hi.

3473
03:12:29,180 --> 03:12:30,180
Ahem.

3474
03:12:30,180 --> 03:12:31,180
Mmmmm.

3475
03:12:31,180 --> 03:12:32,180
Sup.

3476
03:12:32,180 --> 03:12:33,180
Oh I'm gonna choke.

3477
03:12:33,180 --> 03:12:43,500
Sup lass, I feel they need to say something after that Brotherhood part 1 stream.

3478
03:12:43,500 --> 03:12:44,500
What are you talking about?

3479
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:45,500
Why?

3480
03:12:45,500 --> 03:12:49,420
You don't think you could be considered- or oh she why?

3481
03:12:49,420 --> 03:12:52,820
Because there are creators out there who are more experienced, who you think are better

3482
03:12:52,820 --> 03:12:55,260
so clearly would prepare them?

3483
03:12:55,260 --> 03:12:59,100
Have you not followed- have we not followed and supported you for a while heck?

3484
03:12:59,100 --> 03:13:05,660
I've been listening, laughing, relaxing, sagging and straight, jorkin' his pentus.

3485
03:13:05,660 --> 03:13:07,340
For many a time now.

3486
03:13:07,340 --> 03:13:08,340
Why do you think that is?

3487
03:13:08,340 --> 03:13:12,820
Could it mean we adored this silly Scottish gremlin who's not afraid to be herself and

3488
03:13:12,820 --> 03:13:14,900
treat her with love and respect?

3489
03:13:14,900 --> 03:13:18,620
No lass, kick that impostor's syndrome to the curb, we love you.

3490
03:13:18,620 --> 03:13:28,980
Oh you're her or she, case closed, doofus, oh thank you Evelyn, I love you Evelyn, oh.

3491
03:13:28,980 --> 03:13:29,980
Is that a bag of chips?

3492
03:13:29,980 --> 03:13:35,940
No, it's a bowl, like the pea snacks are really hard, I can like dink them on the bowls without

3493
03:13:35,940 --> 03:13:36,940
them cracking.

3494
03:13:36,940 --> 03:13:37,940
Crack.

3495
03:13:37,940 --> 03:13:49,140
Oh there was a marshmallow you wanted to talk about on the other stream but I forgot.

3496
03:13:49,140 --> 03:13:53,420
Oh my god right, hopefully I don't forget this time.

3497
03:13:53,420 --> 03:14:01,740
There's a really brave wreathling who messaged me, well he's not a wreathling but he's asked

3498
03:14:01,740 --> 03:14:05,380
for help's wreathlings okay.

3499
03:14:05,380 --> 03:14:14,300
I'm gonna paraphrase it because I can't quite remember exactly what it said okay but basically

3500
03:14:14,300 --> 03:14:22,700
this person is struggling to brush their teeth and I think it would be very nice if we brush

3501
03:14:22,700 --> 03:14:27,340
our teeth together after stream, like when stream's ending we'll brush our teeth together.

3502
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:33,580
I know that sounds silly however it takes 21 days to form a habit and I think it would

3503
03:14:33,580 --> 03:14:38,660
be nice wreathlings if we could encourage and help people that might struggle with that.

3504
03:14:38,660 --> 03:14:43,380
So if you would like to brush your teeth with me at the end of stream I will give a roughly

3505
03:14:43,380 --> 03:14:49,380
30 minute warning so you don't have any sugary drinks or any food before because that's bad

3506
03:14:49,380 --> 03:14:54,780
for your enamel to brush and I think it can be a really nice thing wreathlings can do for

3507
03:14:54,780 --> 03:14:55,780
someone.

3508
03:14:55,780 --> 03:15:02,820
Even if together we help one person hopefully if we consistently do it for 21 days we have

3509
03:15:02,820 --> 03:15:07,140
helped that person who was very brave by the way that was a very brave message to come

3510
03:15:07,140 --> 03:15:09,260
out with.

3511
03:15:09,260 --> 03:15:16,020
I won't say too much about it but you know you were very straight forward and said that

3512
03:15:16,020 --> 03:15:25,380
you don't you know consider yourself a wreathling and that's okay and you know we can't promise

3513
03:15:25,380 --> 03:15:31,420
that we can help everyone but we would love to maybe show you a way that we can do something

3514
03:15:31,420 --> 03:15:36,580
nice together and it's a lot easier when you do something together with someone.

3515
03:15:36,580 --> 03:15:40,900
So yes thank you for being very brave and reaching out I would like to brush my teeth

3516
03:15:40,900 --> 03:15:45,420
with you when I end stream I don't know if you're out there or not but we can definitely

3517
03:15:45,420 --> 03:15:56,740
do that together yes I see no problem yes unfortunately I don't have the consistent time where we can

3518
03:15:56,740 --> 03:16:00,460
not brush your teeth it would just have to be roughly 30 minutes before my stream ends

3519
03:16:00,460 --> 03:16:05,500
sorry I'm pushing in my chair you're pushing my chair.

3520
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:13,340
Hi strongy congrats on debut I was wondering um nope you're done any games coming out that

3521
03:16:13,340 --> 03:16:19,540
you're excited for multiplayer the binding of Isaac apparently someone went data mining

3522
03:16:19,540 --> 03:16:25,180
and saw that there was a new repentance after plus or something so there might be patches

3523
03:16:25,180 --> 03:16:30,780
to current items which would be very interesting forming new habits with my oh she sounds like

3524
03:16:30,780 --> 03:16:37,140
a tuition name honestly join oral improvement she's getting closer to I am the urge to crack

3525
03:16:37,140 --> 03:16:42,260
a british joke oh my teeth are mangled honestly my teeth are mangled I'm like they're healthy

3526
03:16:42,260 --> 03:16:48,460
but they're just all squint and it's like I like the look of oh my god there's apparently

3527
03:16:48,460 --> 03:16:53,740
a pandemic happening in America with veneers veneers are like these fake things you put

3528
03:16:53,740 --> 03:16:57,700
on top of your teeth that are shaved down and it makes them look perfect but I feel

3529
03:16:57,700 --> 03:17:03,540
like teeth have personality like I like my wee squinty-winty teeth um I just I've never

3530
03:17:03,540 --> 03:17:09,660
seen myself any other way so it's me oh yeah I do understand for people that do need braces

3531
03:17:09,660 --> 03:17:14,860
like there's probably something else going on but I like I was obsessed and I never got

3532
03:17:14,860 --> 03:17:21,340
braces um and yeah I just have naturally squint teeth like they didn't come out perfect and

3533
03:17:21,340 --> 03:17:30,860
that's fine that's just how it is um mommy I really need a hug debut has made me really

3534
03:17:30,860 --> 03:17:36,980
emotional oh a little reflame trust me I know this isn't about me but I'm talking to you

3535
03:17:36,980 --> 03:17:41,860
now you should be so proud of what you've accomplished I am the girls have done fantastic

3536
03:17:41,860 --> 03:17:46,700
and I'm having a good time with my weathlands you and the girls but I feel much more lonely

3537
03:17:46,700 --> 03:17:52,420
than I did before oh watching everyone interact with each other the girls respond into mario's

3538
03:17:52,420 --> 03:17:57,460
ma rose and such I don't even know why I suppose I'm just envious of the attention that everyone's

3539
03:17:57,460 --> 03:18:03,260
getting I feel so out of place I'm so sad I haven't even been able to listen to your

3540
03:18:03,260 --> 03:18:09,300
audios to sleep I'm sorry for being selfish I feel selfish at all are you are you maybe

3541
03:18:09,300 --> 03:18:16,220
one of the lurkers that are shy to say anything or have I managed to successfully accidentally

3542
03:18:16,220 --> 03:18:22,540
dodge all your messages and stream and I would be a bit upset too if you were talking away

3543
03:18:22,540 --> 03:18:27,420
and I accidentally never read out any of your messages so I do apologize if that happens

3544
03:18:27,420 --> 03:18:34,420
and well I'm sorry real little reflame I never want to make you feel lonely if you are a lurker

3545
03:18:34,420 --> 03:18:39,500
and you're a bit scared to talk that's okay whatever your comfort level is you're allowed

3546
03:18:39,500 --> 03:18:46,060
to be that you can always say you can always be at arm's length or you can always be attached

3547
03:18:46,060 --> 03:18:55,580
up my head you can sit on my head if you like and and it's okay but just I don't know hopefully

3548
03:18:55,580 --> 03:19:00,260
it doesn't make you feel lonely like we vibe and I get to show you my childhood game you

3550
03:19:05,580 --> 03:19:12,340
yeah lurkers are beloved yes I understand for lurkers sometimes it can be a bit nerve

3551
03:19:12,340 --> 03:19:18,380
racking as well to like be perceived with my eyeballs and like I I read out what you see

3552
03:19:18,380 --> 03:19:26,860
and stuff but um literally uh if you would like evidence from my autistic diagnosis please refer

3553
03:19:26,860 --> 03:19:31,340
to my first stream which was 12 hours long and the only reason I went off instead of 14 hours

3554
03:19:31,340 --> 03:19:37,420
of full gameplay is because of bod okay I'm usually playing something and lurking yeah like

3555
03:19:37,420 --> 03:19:42,300
it's perfectly okay to lurk and just do your thing not wrong with lurking absolutely not

3556
03:19:42,940 --> 03:19:50,540
um don't be shy reflame strongy isn't always reading my comments but yeah it's um a guberrino

3557
03:19:50,540 --> 03:19:59,020
so I do apologize I've ever made you feel left out um and hopefully it doesn't happen in the future

3558
03:19:59,900 --> 03:20:01,340
I can only apologize

3559
03:20:03,180 --> 03:20:09,020
uh sometimes hi strongy want you to know what I think it's very cute when you narrowed out about

3560
03:20:09,020 --> 03:20:13,900
sassus gree brother it well I'm getting rolled in the dlcs clearly I'm not built for the dlc

3561
03:20:18,060 --> 03:20:24,060
I have a little sip of cola a fizzy juice I lurk when I'm at work mm yeah a lot of people like

3562
03:20:24,060 --> 03:20:30,940
lurking and listening to strongy podcast wait if you don't see the screen when I'm streaming and

3563
03:20:30,940 --> 03:20:38,540
like I'm beating up bad guys and oh you hear us huh oh take this oh like are you like oh what's

3564
03:20:38,540 --> 03:20:44,460
going on or can you use context clues I like to have the stream one in the background but I do

3565
03:20:44,460 --> 03:20:48,860
like to interact I'm like yeah don't feel don't ever feel forced to interact I know some people shy

3566
03:20:48,860 --> 03:20:56,380
like that hi goddess just wondering if you could forward something to management I know

3567
03:20:56,380 --> 03:21:01,020
viola or not on holodex but you can still view the stream of the URL

3568
03:21:01,900 --> 03:21:07,340
but I think the girls have something set that prevents their streams from being viewed through

3569
03:21:07,340 --> 03:21:17,980
third-party sites well mine is fame I can't be right it's true screen off pretend and strongy

3570
03:21:18,060 --> 03:21:20,300
physically throwing the refill and then around for sport

3571
03:21:23,500 --> 03:21:27,500
to be honest you talk enough that there isn't dead air so I don't have to wonder about what's

3572
03:21:27,500 --> 03:21:34,460
going on yeah I can't believe it wait was there really no dead air in the last stream I must

3573
03:21:34,460 --> 03:21:39,980
have been quiet at some sections there's no way I had the video playing I just can't fully watch

3574
03:21:39,980 --> 03:21:46,780
the whole stream yes the streams are a bit too long for the average adult uh okay management's

3575
03:21:46,780 --> 03:21:50,860
gonna look into holodex I think that puts all their streams together we were thinking about

3576
03:21:50,860 --> 03:21:55,660
hosting a website that showed all our stream schedules but it cost like more money and it

3577
03:21:55,660 --> 03:21:59,820
was just kind of one of those things where look holodex does it for free we're just gonna let

3578
03:21:59,820 --> 03:22:05,500
holodex take over who goes there I died for yourself there is almost no dead air outside of breaks

3579
03:22:06,860 --> 03:22:11,660
I may wonder my throat is sore honestly after uh after I've been done with you

3580
03:22:12,620 --> 03:22:19,580
I've watched for about five hours and wasn't any dead air you talked the entire time I do I'm

3581
03:22:19,580 --> 03:22:24,860
very passionate about this game very very passionate uh sorry if I missed it but what are we

3582
03:22:25,580 --> 03:22:28,860
yes your reeflings I was very dumb and never showed you what you look like that's you

3583
03:22:31,020 --> 03:22:38,860
I've lost some gnar twerk of nature of us together and what's the old twitter check out

3584
03:22:38,860 --> 03:22:44,700
who I follow on stronycuddles on twitter I don't use twitter much you're much better given a

3585
03:22:44,700 --> 03:22:50,780
like and a subscribe to this youtube channel I am not much of a twitter person okay in a gush I

3586
03:22:50,780 --> 03:22:57,020
use twitter now pretty much to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey want to make a samar

3587
03:22:57,020 --> 03:23:06,940
hey sweetcakes want to make a samar basically that's what I do I think your longest dead air

3588
03:23:06,940 --> 03:23:13,260
was the sprint section where you were against the clock and you're still monologued more like

3589
03:23:13,260 --> 03:23:19,100
monomogged because I'm just that good at being a yap or ooo hey strony loving the assassin's

3590
03:23:19,100 --> 03:23:25,580
greed I was wondering if you have ever seen or played lost planet one or two I haven't there

3591
03:23:25,580 --> 03:23:29,580
are fun games that I think you may like even if you don't play them I still appreciate you for

3592
03:23:29,580 --> 03:23:35,980
beating this message I have not I've never heard of them or I can't remember them being on the cover

3593
03:23:36,060 --> 03:23:45,980
of an xbox 360 so probably not have I ever played dragon age I played the demo of dragon age

3594
03:23:47,340 --> 03:23:54,860
one I think uh where it's like brother and sister at the star and then one of them perishes if I

3595
03:23:54,860 --> 03:24:01,100
remember correctly yeah that's how much dragon age I've done I don't know what it's like um

3596
03:24:01,340 --> 03:24:11,020
but yeah yes one take flamboyant cuttlefishes are highly poisonous okay well I'm a flamboyant

3597
03:24:11,020 --> 03:24:14,700
because I'm a watermelon candy here someone described as watermelon candy and I'm like

3598
03:24:14,700 --> 03:24:20,380
honestly true true uh will there be streams on other platforms okay

3599
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:28,060
congratulations on your debut I'm looking forward to supporting all the talents I must

3600
03:24:28,060 --> 03:24:34,060
apologize I said that's so wrong I must apologize but I find myself confused what you meant by

3601
03:24:34,060 --> 03:24:39,980
vealers collab restrictions and I'm looking forward to clarification you describe the

3602
03:24:39,980 --> 03:24:47,180
collab restrictions as the unwritten rule through other information do you mean for me

3603
03:24:47,980 --> 03:24:54,940
my collab restrictions are um I'm like if I don't know that someone is like me mentally

3604
03:24:54,940 --> 03:24:58,620
then I can't stream with them because I'm dumb I can stream with the girls though that's fine

3605
03:24:58,620 --> 03:25:05,820
and the girls can stream with whoever they like other than males they're not allowed to stream with

3606
03:25:05,820 --> 03:25:15,260
males or interact with males or follow males literally that's the only rule and so far so good

3607
03:25:16,060 --> 03:25:21,820
literally none of the girls have broken that rule strongy slaps of each of us behind I can make you

3608
03:25:21,820 --> 03:25:30,860
a star yeah um it seems odd for me for them to be rules I've never heard of any other agency that

3609
03:25:30,860 --> 03:25:38,780
has an outright rule against them against who sorry I'm not read this properly uh especially

3610
03:25:38,780 --> 03:25:46,460
value in freedom doesn't that apologize if it comes off with really critical however I think

3611
03:25:46,460 --> 03:25:50,140
clarification word on the issue oh and they can freaking go wherever they want

3612
03:25:52,780 --> 03:26:02,620
oh this is asking about male collabs the person has said wrestle tube collabs were like mixed

3613
03:26:02,620 --> 03:26:10,620
would the girls be able to do that I mean I would never stop them from an opportunity

3614
03:26:11,740 --> 03:26:16,940
like would they be on the same team as a guy like I don't think I don't think that's like

3615
03:26:16,940 --> 03:26:23,100
advised if it was like that like I wouldn't advise it however none of the girls have given me an

3616
03:26:23,100 --> 03:26:30,940
indication to ever even do that like I think we would be like sorry but uh we can't uh we are

3617
03:26:31,900 --> 03:26:37,980
following Japanese idol culture and uh no male sorry sorry we sexist out here

3618
03:26:39,580 --> 03:26:43,900
which is terrible don't say that I learned don't say that part I learned keep burping don't apologize

3619
03:26:47,580 --> 03:26:53,500
hello again friend of a friend I knew you well

3620
03:26:57,100 --> 03:27:06,220
no true it's just a rule that you can bet sitting my love on

3621
03:27:07,100 --> 03:27:11,260
I don't remember the words pick it up every time

3622
03:27:20,060 --> 03:27:25,100
hi strongy I think you've been one guy what does that mean saying names is okay as long as it's not

3623
03:27:25,100 --> 03:27:33,260
too much oh no so the way I I've been taught V tripper culture I'm so sorry but I've been taught

3624
03:27:33,260 --> 03:27:40,300
by the majority V tripper culture I'm not allowed to say your name unless you don't know

3625
03:27:40,300 --> 03:27:50,540
or membership however because and the reason why I can't do it when it's like just saying hi section

3626
03:27:50,540 --> 03:27:57,580
or in general is because like people think favoritism is forming or jealousy and I really

3627
03:27:57,580 --> 03:28:05,180
don't want anyone feeling put out um wait that's exactly what you've just said to me

3628
03:28:07,340 --> 03:28:11,900
we have just agreed okay we've just agreed yes we have agreed um at the start of the ASMR stream

3629
03:28:11,900 --> 03:28:17,660
I am going to try and say people's names just as a special thank you for showing up how do you feel

3630
03:28:17,660 --> 03:28:22,620
that you're no longer a v-tweeter well hopefully my first stream length really showed how much I

3631
03:28:22,700 --> 03:28:31,820
enjoy v-jobbing sup cuddles was thinking of a tag uh I've missed the tags I kind of finished them

3632
03:28:31,820 --> 03:28:40,940
oopsie uh please do give us a guide for those script writing yes um I'm currently getting a

3633
03:28:40,940 --> 03:28:47,740
new manager on board that deals with all the scripts and thank god he is a male because he

3634
03:28:47,740 --> 03:28:52,460
can actually write scripts that guys want to hear because I can only guess what you want to hear

3635
03:28:52,460 --> 03:28:59,520
and so much. So like roughly the first three months of scripts are me, and then it goes

3636
03:28:59,520 --> 03:29:04,500
to other script writers, and then it goes to the script manager, but we're a testing

3637
03:29:04,500 --> 03:29:10,440
script manager. But if all goes well, my responsibility is less than so much, and I can stream so

3638
03:29:10,440 --> 03:29:18,440
much more! Well at the start of the stream you were at 3.5k, now you're at 3.3. Heck

3639
03:29:18,440 --> 03:29:25,440
yeah, that means I don't have to edit the 4k thousand any time soon. That's fine. Hey,

3640
03:29:25,440 --> 03:29:36,440
I have to say that I think you are amazing. I don't get to interact with many Scottish

3641
03:29:36,440 --> 03:29:41,280
people online. That's because a lot of things had to go wrong in my Scottish life to become

3642
03:29:41,280 --> 03:29:47,440
a VTuber. That's why there's no Scottish VTubers. Do you know how? Oh no, I've hurt

3643
03:29:47,440 --> 03:29:54,440
myself. My finger is bleeding. Why? What did I cut myself on? I've not touched anything

3644
03:29:54,440 --> 03:30:01,440
sharp. Is there anything sharp in this room? Ouch. It stings. Hopefully I can still keep

3645
03:30:01,440 --> 03:30:07,440
gaming. Scotland only has one computer. No like genuinely, there's a reason why there's

3646
03:30:07,440 --> 03:30:15,440
not a lot of Scottish VTubers. If you genuinely like grew up around, well like grew up around

3647
03:30:15,440 --> 03:30:21,440
like normal friends, you would genuinely be like bullied so hard. Like bully culture like

3648
03:30:21,440 --> 03:30:28,440
in America and Australia and the UK is so prevalent. Like if you show any enjoyment or being slightly

3649
03:30:28,440 --> 03:30:35,440
different from the status quo, you get sicked on like a hound like sickum. It was crazy.

3650
03:30:35,440 --> 03:30:41,440
Pour some Azura milk on it honestly. I don't know, I can't remember how I cut myself. My

3651
03:30:41,440 --> 03:30:50,440
finger. I'm okay though. Someone says, hi Strony, I missed all of your livestreams,

3652
03:30:50,440 --> 03:30:57,440
rip. But I do have a few questions. What happens if one of the girls wants to leave? They leave?

3653
03:30:57,440 --> 03:31:02,440
Question mark? They get to go? We don't have a non-compete. I don't believe in them. I don't

3654
03:31:02,440 --> 03:31:07,440
think they're nice. They are not kind. If you no longer work for the Vealer agency, why

3655
03:31:07,440 --> 03:31:14,440
do you prevent you from making money elsewhere? That is called being messed up. Will you retire

3656
03:31:14,440 --> 03:31:22,440
the character? Yeah. Also if you can, what are the plans for Gen 2? Will you bring in

3657
03:31:22,440 --> 03:31:32,440
6 new girls and retire the other? If Gen 2 is the thing, there will be 6 new girls on

3658
03:31:32,440 --> 03:31:38,440
board. When Vealer agencies come out with Generations, everyone can be active at the

3659
03:31:38,440 --> 03:31:44,440
same time. It's not a problem. So Generation 1, all 6 active. Generation 2, all 6 active.

3660
03:31:44,440 --> 03:31:47,440
So that would be 12 total. Then if Generation 3 and everyone's happy with their cuts and

3661
03:31:47,440 --> 03:31:54,440
things are all nice and swimmingly, then Generation 3 and there will be a total of 18

3662
03:31:55,440 --> 03:32:03,440
Succubi and V Succubi. Wow. That's very daunting to think of but thank God I'm not the script

3663
03:32:03,440 --> 03:32:08,440
master anymore because if I was the script master, I could not stream. I genuinely could

3664
03:32:08,440 --> 03:32:18,440
not stream. There are absolutely no interest for any Generations after 3. No spin-off Generations.

3665
03:32:18,440 --> 03:32:26,440
No secret plans. No save for work Generations. None of that. I am exhausted. I took insane

3666
03:32:26,440 --> 03:32:36,440
amounts of HP damage getting Gen 1 out. I am ill. I want to get myself better and I'm

3667
03:32:36,440 --> 03:32:46,440
going to stream and I'm going to enjoy every second of it. But yeah, we are not having

3668
03:32:46,440 --> 03:32:53,440
to retire Gen 1 to get Gen 2 out. No. Sorry. Lastly, and this may be Taboo to ask. I'll

3669
03:32:53,440 --> 03:33:05,440
read it in my head. That is controversial. It's not controversial. What's an item you

3670
03:33:05,440 --> 03:33:13,440
would copy and steal from the other girls? Succubi's not. I will be taking no further

3671
03:33:13,440 --> 03:33:21,440
questions. Why is everything in Japanese? Are you weeb? Nothing's in Japanese. Actually

3672
03:33:21,440 --> 03:33:28,440
this is a fully English stream. There's nothing in Japanese at all here. What's going on?

3673
03:33:28,440 --> 03:33:46,440
How am I supposed to support the girls when you keep pulling me in? I'm pulling you into

3674
03:33:46,440 --> 03:33:57,440
my gravitational pull. Can't escape this gravitational pull. The website? Oh why Marshmallows

3675
03:33:57,440 --> 03:34:06,440
You'll never guess what country Marshmallow was made in. It was made in Japan. It's all

3676
03:34:06,440 --> 03:34:17,440
Japanese so Google. I use Firefox which does have a translator thing. Someone says please

3677
03:34:17,440 --> 03:34:24,440
William Wallis all over me. Oh yeah you like that. I don't know if this made it through

3678
03:34:24,440 --> 03:34:38,440
into twice. It's a PNG. Do we open it? Are we going to open it live on stream? Oh it's

3679
03:34:38,440 --> 03:34:46,440
me with my autism hair. I thought it was going to be something else. I had my autism hair.

3680
03:34:46,440 --> 03:34:51,440
I thought it was going to be something else. But I saw it was a PNG and I was like I'll

3681
03:34:51,440 --> 03:35:02,440
go for it. Okay I just quickly refreshed. We've got a few more and then we'll jump back

3682
03:35:02,440 --> 03:35:23,440
into their pay. Someone says check Smuttlefish hashtag. Hashtag is on safe mode. Show me the

3683
03:35:23,440 --> 03:35:33,440
goods. Smuttle did I spell it right? It's been hating? It's hidden for me? Check your search.

3684
03:35:33,440 --> 03:35:51,440
Hate sensitive media. Absolutely not. Show me the goods. There's two goods inside. Oh my god I have

3685
03:35:51,440 --> 03:36:05,440
faith. And my hair is so big and I'm sitting in a clam. And there's a second one. Oh my god there's

3686
03:36:05,440 --> 03:36:13,440
two. In the second one I say come closer to me. Have I got hypno eyes? Oh I've got hypno

3687
03:36:13,440 --> 03:36:20,440
eyes in the second one. Oh that's so good. They're so good. I love it. Thank you. I cannot

3688
03:36:20,440 --> 03:36:26,440
react to it because I'm on my minicum. But they're so good. There's three R's. I can't

3689
03:36:26,440 --> 03:36:33,440
see the third one. I only see two. Some accounts seem to be muted for me for some reason. I

3690
03:36:33,440 --> 03:36:44,440
can't see the third one. Only see two. I don't see it. It's not displaying. I don't know what's up

3691
03:36:44,440 --> 03:37:08,440
with Twitter. It's like really having a hard time. I see it. I have a tail. It looks like

3692
03:37:08,440 --> 03:37:18,440
three. Girls and viewers have a tail. No I have a tail. I have a leash. I have a leash. Oh

3693
03:37:18,440 --> 03:37:32,440
my god. Oh my god. Thank you. I love it. I have a leash. Oh it's so good. And the tail goes

3694
03:37:32,440 --> 03:37:43,440
green at the tip as well. Just like my horror. I'm going to stare at it for a very suspiciously

3695
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:55,440
small amount of time later today. That's terrible. What are you doing to me? I should be the one

3696
03:37:55,440 --> 03:38:07,440
saying this to you. I accidentally... Thank you very much for that fanart. I like all fanart

3697
03:38:07,440 --> 03:38:14,440
actually. I need to put it in my folder. I have a folder of all the fanarts in so far.

3698
03:38:14,440 --> 03:38:22,440
Someone says, I loved your audios in the part where you talked about... Yeah you let me talk

3699
03:38:23,440 --> 03:38:28,440
about her baguette and go squishy with it. It's the nicotine patch under the bangs for

3700
03:38:28,440 --> 03:38:33,440
real. I don't actually have it. However I quite like the idea that we both have the nicotine

3701
03:38:33,440 --> 03:38:39,440
patch because we're both addicted to each other as we are each other. Yes, yes, yes. It doesn't

3702
03:38:39,440 --> 03:38:46,440
show up on my... Yeah it never showed up on my face. Hi strongy. I just want to say that's

3703
03:38:46,440 --> 03:38:50,440
really great how much you care about the progression of the other girls and your inspirational

3704
03:38:50,440 --> 03:38:57,440
speech in your first AC Brotherhood. You're a really cute person. I hope you have all great

3705
03:38:57,440 --> 03:39:03,440
and long careers. Also now I have a thing for the Scottish accent. Oh I do you like this big man?

3706
03:39:03,440 --> 03:39:11,440
Oh I am pure coming over to you like a satyabas coming to your house. You'll be sleeping in

3707
03:39:11,440 --> 03:39:17,440
your bed and then you'll feel my hundle over you. That's right and before you know it you've

3708
03:39:17,440 --> 03:39:24,440
popped abowny and it's all that funny. Is that what you want? Is that what you want?

3709
03:39:24,440 --> 03:39:30,440
Because you got it with me baby. Is Daystream another endurance stream? I have no idea. I'm

3710
03:39:30,440 --> 03:39:36,440
a bit nervous. I don't know if we can do 100% Assassin's Creed so we're just having fun.

3711
03:39:36,440 --> 03:39:40,440
Strongy is just an industry plant from the Scottish tourism board. Don't fall for it.

3712
03:39:40,440 --> 03:39:46,440
Don't fall for my tricks. You shouldn't come to Glasgow and spend all your hard earned money.

3713
03:39:46,440 --> 03:39:53,440
There's totally no amazing lovely tourist cafes in Glasgow.

3714
03:39:53,440 --> 03:39:58,440
Watching Austin Powers is going to hit different. I've never seen it. I'm so excited to watch

3715
03:39:58,440 --> 03:40:09,440
Austin Powers you guys. I think that's all the lovely Maru's I have. I is 411 Maru's.

3716
03:40:10,440 --> 03:40:24,440
Okay who's ready to replay this memory? Weirdly I haven't had an urge to visit Glasgow.

3717
03:40:24,440 --> 03:40:37,440
Scotland has turned to hypnotism. Wait did we not finish that memory? Oh we didn't. I thought

3718
03:40:37,440 --> 03:40:44,440
we did. I went away and got food. Nori nori.

3719
03:41:07,440 --> 03:41:13,440
Okay are you trying to get achievements? I'm going to see where it takes us. I don't know

3720
03:41:13,440 --> 03:41:22,440
if I can do 100%. My confidence as we played some of the DLCs has gone down significantly

3721
03:41:22,440 --> 03:41:31,440
because I don't know what the solution is to a few hundred percent. So if this game tells

3722
03:41:31,440 --> 03:41:36,440
me I have a new outfit unlocked one more time I'm going to cry. It's done it so much. How

3723
03:41:36,440 --> 03:41:44,440
does my browser all come to die directly to stories? Oh that's terrible. I need to start

3724
03:41:44,440 --> 03:41:48,440
retweeting stuff. Like I want to rule play with the R. I'm sorry I said it I don't care.

3725
03:41:48,440 --> 03:41:52,440
People find it cringe. Yeah you know what's cringe? Your VTuber never had any good time

3726
03:41:52,440 --> 03:42:04,440
with you. That's cringe. That's different. Hypnotic Scottish assessment.

3727
03:42:07,440 --> 03:42:13,440
Forbacione is such a specific word. Oh we are like that.

3728
03:42:17,440 --> 03:42:22,440
So we don't actually want to kill this archer because if we do his body is going to drop

3729
03:42:22,440 --> 03:42:29,440
down. See how it only got out. I'm going to pray the body doesn't fall right in front

3730
03:42:29,440 --> 03:42:46,440
of me. Don't do it ragdoll physics. I'm going to be mad. I might actually have to try hard

3731
03:42:46,440 --> 03:42:50,440
during this segment. I'm not to touch the ground and I'm not to get detected. I do have

3732
03:42:50,440 --> 03:42:57,440
issues. Are you trying to give me a heart attack because it's actually working me. You're

3733
03:42:57,440 --> 03:43:02,440
getting me concerned. I'm getting a bit concerned about how much you're launching. You're launching

3734
03:43:02,440 --> 03:43:07,440
yourself. He's at a rooftop. I have no idea if you guys can understand me when I start

3735
03:43:07,440 --> 03:43:14,440
doing that on purpose. Like being super scots on purpose. Or does it just sound like it's

3736
03:43:14,440 --> 03:43:23,440
just kind of like pleasant noises for you. I think we're just going to do that. Yeah

3737
03:43:24,440 --> 03:43:31,440
As long as his body doesn't go sliding down off I'm fine with everything that goes on.

3738
03:43:31,440 --> 03:43:37,440
I understand it. No it's pleasant. Oh my god you guys are so scots. If you can you're

3739
03:43:37,440 --> 03:43:48,440
actually getting pretty scots. Is it? Wait is that your literal translation of scots

3740
03:43:48,440 --> 03:44:04,440
there? Stop. What does that say? I'm like trying to reach out and play the game at the same time.

3741
03:44:04,440 --> 03:44:08,440
I'm actually such a skilled streamer. Sorry I played this game so much I couldn't do it.

3742
03:44:08,440 --> 03:44:13,440
There are some bits and pieces here and there but it's mostly understandable. Ah, tu comprendes?

3743
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:18,440
Fuck it let's just go French. I'm surprisingly soothing. I'm definitely going to do a hard

3744
03:44:18,440 --> 03:44:24,440
Scottish accent ASMR. I don't know what I should do with it like tingle wise. Or maybe it should

3745
03:44:24,440 --> 03:44:31,440
just be like go to sleep mate. I'll get these. These are really coolant on your face and they

3746
03:44:31,440 --> 03:44:36,440
go bloop bloop bloop bloop. And it'll be really nice. It'll put you to sleep real quick. Oh

3747
03:44:36,440 --> 03:44:40,440
you still don't want to sleep right? Let me get the ear cleaner and snake. I think you

3748
03:44:40,440 --> 03:44:46,440
call it a Q-tip but it's actually called ear cleaner. That's the kind of ASMR I want to do.

3749
03:44:46,440 --> 03:44:53,440
Yes please. I'll just call it super scots ASMR and then people are like don't be silly.

3750
03:44:53,440 --> 03:44:58,440
There's no such thing as super scots ASMR and then they click the listen and they're like

3751
03:44:58,440 --> 03:45:11,440
they click to listen and they're like I understand now. I get it. Oh please don't ragdoll physics.

3752
03:45:11,440 --> 03:45:19,440
Do no drop. They cannot get past those cortisans huh? I feel like there's definitely more on the

3753
03:45:19,440 --> 03:45:25,440
map. I think that person yesterday was actually correct and said the more favour you gain with

3754
03:45:25,440 --> 03:45:32,440
the factions the more they appear on the map because all of a sudden I'm seeing zans everywhere.

3755
03:45:32,440 --> 03:45:40,440
His body is tempted to fold over. Literally it's like giving me a mini heart attack. Can I aim on you? Aim, aim, aim.

3756
03:45:40,440 --> 03:45:47,440
No aim bot, aim bot, aim bot. Just don't want to do it for me. It's really annoying when it does that.

3757
03:45:48,440 --> 03:45:56,440
That's not good. I really do not want that guy to be able to see me.

3758
03:45:56,440 --> 03:46:05,440
Oh no, no, no, don't, don't, don't. Yeah, didn't think so mate. Right, he's just discovered that body.

3759
03:46:05,440 --> 03:46:14,440
Do I desync because he sees the body or am I? I actually think I'm safe. You know that? I think I've done it.

3760
03:46:14,440 --> 03:46:23,440
Even though he sees the dead bodies of I, that's fine. Okay, we did it. We just have to hang out on this little edge.

3761
03:46:23,440 --> 03:46:30,440
Oh no we don't because there's freaking guards right there which I don't like. Hopefully we don't have a problem.

3762
03:46:30,440 --> 03:46:40,440
Scotch, want me to speak calmly while you enjoy a heart meal? Is it weird being the Scottish accent? No, it's not weird at all.

3763
03:46:40,440 --> 03:46:57,440
It sounds like home. A body? Just another day in the room. Honestly, if you've totaled how many SEOs joined, I feel like it's a really considerable number.

3764
03:46:58,440 --> 03:47:04,440
Wait, can I move on this? Do not be detected and do not touch the ground while tail in the centre.

3765
03:47:10,440 --> 03:47:20,440
I can touch the ground now, right? That's definitely not, I'm not. I swear if this is like we're broken it.

3766
03:47:20,440 --> 03:47:29,440
Yeah, okay, I was gonna say I was like that's the silliest thing I've ever heard if it's like you're not allowed to do it.

3767
03:47:32,440 --> 03:47:34,440
Celtic language is just assistant to me.

3768
03:47:35,440 --> 03:47:39,440
Oh, there's Scotch, there's Scotch. Can you get up please?

3769
03:47:42,440 --> 03:47:44,440
It's not mysterious.

3770
03:47:45,440 --> 03:47:56,440
Video embedding issues should now be fixed for all channels. We're not on Holodex, are we? Did you guys already get us on Holodex? There's no way.

3771
03:47:59,440 --> 03:48:07,440
Or are we? I thought it was like a view thing like you needed a certain amount of views ourselves or something.

3772
03:48:08,440 --> 03:48:13,440
Thanks, we suck.

3773
03:48:14,440 --> 03:48:17,440
There's an endy say. Ah, I confirm. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3774
03:48:18,440 --> 03:48:27,440
Hopefully everyone's viewable and you can see what's up. Shibi's still alive, I believe, and we don't have a zero today.

3775
03:48:28,440 --> 03:48:30,440
I think it's a rest day for a zero if I'm not mistaken.

3776
03:48:30,440 --> 03:48:42,440
Okay, we're done. We did it, 100%. You're not, but you can still use the zero to create your own.

3777
03:48:43,440 --> 03:48:46,440
Not views, so I've got a 20 key average on channel, yeah.

3778
03:48:47,440 --> 03:48:49,440
It means about to go live, heck yeah. What's it mean to do in the day?

3779
03:48:50,440 --> 03:48:54,440
I would highly recommend in and out.

3780
03:48:55,440 --> 03:49:00,440
Yeah, the court is blocked us from being able to do the bench thing. I know how to do the bench thing, it's not a problem.

3781
03:49:05,440 --> 03:49:07,440
Oh, she's meme reviewing.

3782
03:49:07,440 --> 03:49:09,440
Come on, come on, come on.

3783
03:49:12,440 --> 03:49:15,440
Scots East, more strongly misunderstanding the listener's lack of accent.

3784
03:49:16,440 --> 03:49:17,440
We can't go in.

3785
03:49:18,440 --> 03:49:24,440
Fitty land, boy. Fitty land? Fitty land? Fitty land?

3786
03:49:29,440 --> 03:49:31,440
Well, you've succeeded in confusing me.

3787
03:49:32,440 --> 03:49:34,440
I'm back. Take a break to listen to music.

3788
03:49:38,440 --> 03:49:40,440
Hell, Claudia, the banker is here.

3789
03:49:41,440 --> 03:49:44,440
Oh, I have so much money to hire these lovely ladies.

3790
03:49:49,440 --> 03:49:50,440
I'm too good, literally.

3791
03:49:52,440 --> 03:49:56,440
Okay, Emmy live in... when? Soon?

3792
03:50:00,440 --> 03:50:02,440
Can't take the name of the music, so...

3793
03:50:02,440 --> 03:50:03,440
Beautiful.

3794
03:50:07,440 --> 03:50:08,440
Ciao bella.

3795
03:50:10,440 --> 03:50:11,440
Che cosa.

3796
03:50:14,440 --> 03:50:17,440
I don't want to get them on that sofa.

3797
03:50:20,440 --> 03:50:22,440
Oh, he's staring around.

3798
03:50:24,440 --> 03:50:26,440
No one's actually named it Luigi.

3799
03:50:29,440 --> 03:50:31,440
Darling Bratter sister, Emmy.

3800
03:50:33,440 --> 03:50:36,440
Darling Bratter. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy.

3801
03:50:37,440 --> 03:50:43,440
See, that five times fast. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy.

3802
03:50:49,440 --> 03:50:52,440
But they are giggling away and won't stop losing.

3803
03:50:54,440 --> 03:50:57,440
Right, so take them and then go back to the full stack.

3804
03:50:58,440 --> 03:51:00,440
Because I don't want to get in any trouble.

3805
03:51:03,440 --> 03:51:13,440
I think we just got 50% DNA, so I think we might actually have...

3806
03:51:18,440 --> 03:51:22,440
I think we might actually have a new Pristina memory unlock.

3807
03:51:22,440 --> 03:51:30,440
If it's 25%, then 50%, then 75% like that reason said, then should we help?

3808
03:51:33,440 --> 03:51:35,440
I can protect you.

3809
03:51:36,440 --> 03:51:37,440
I can protect you?

3810
03:51:40,440 --> 03:51:42,440
Speaking of smoking, you're fortuitary friendly.

3811
03:51:43,440 --> 03:51:46,440
You want to go for it? No, nothing for me to say.

3812
03:51:52,440 --> 03:51:55,440
I'm trying so hard not to lose them to a guard right now.

3813
03:51:56,440 --> 03:51:59,440
I think we're okay with the render difference.

3814
03:52:00,440 --> 03:52:03,440
I have no idea what we're missing and not done yet.

3815
03:52:04,440 --> 03:52:09,440
We're replaying easy missions that I failed in order to get higher DNA sequence.

3816
03:52:09,440 --> 03:52:16,440
Pristina's story doesn't unlock until you have high synchronicity, so I'm having to go back and redo missions that are easy.

3817
03:52:16,440 --> 03:52:18,440
And that will raise our overall percentage.

3818
03:52:19,440 --> 03:52:27,440
And then we should be able to finish whatever happens with Pristina because it ended and it didn't make any sense at all.

3819
03:52:29,440 --> 03:52:37,440
We're done this part, we just need to do the benchmark now.

3820
03:52:39,440 --> 03:52:42,440
How far are you planning on taking Viola or dominating?

3821
03:52:42,440 --> 03:52:43,440
No, not dominating.

3822
03:52:43,440 --> 03:52:47,440
I just want the girls to achieve their dreams and achieve what they want to do.

3823
03:52:50,440 --> 03:52:51,440
Have a good time.

3824
03:52:52,440 --> 03:52:54,440
It's kind of like what are Viola's dreams?

3825
03:52:54,440 --> 03:52:58,440
Viola's dreams or whatever the girls' dreams are because we want them to be happy.

3826
03:53:00,440 --> 03:53:03,440
Interesting what about alcohol?

3827
03:53:03,440 --> 03:53:05,440
Oh, I can't have alcohol.

3828
03:53:05,440 --> 03:53:07,440
Have you guys drank its fine?

3829
03:53:07,440 --> 03:53:08,440
I'm going to stop you.

3830
03:53:10,440 --> 03:53:14,440
But yeah, alcohol and me don't go well.

3831
03:53:14,440 --> 03:53:18,440
It speeds up my heart rate, it makes me feel uncomfortable and I get...

3832
03:53:18,440 --> 03:53:21,440
I'm very late wait, even though I'm Scottish.

3833
03:53:21,440 --> 03:53:24,440
I'm so freaking late wait, it's so annoying.

3834
03:53:24,440 --> 03:53:26,440
I'm stinky, like why?

3835
03:53:29,440 --> 03:53:31,440
So I just can't really handle it.

3836
03:53:32,440 --> 03:53:33,440
I don't do it.

3837
03:53:33,440 --> 03:53:36,440
Also there's been like tons of reports that come out where alcohol is really bad.

3838
03:53:36,440 --> 03:53:40,440
But I'm not going to say no to like drunk karaoke streams or something like that.

3839
03:53:41,440 --> 03:53:44,440
I kind of learned that...

3840
03:53:49,440 --> 03:53:55,440
So when you feel a buzz from alcohol, you don't have to drink any further than that point to keep the buzz going.

3841
03:53:55,440 --> 03:53:57,440
That's not how alcohol works.

3842
03:53:57,440 --> 03:54:00,440
I only recently learned that back anyway.

3843
03:54:00,440 --> 03:54:04,440
But I won't be shy of doing like drunk karaoke.

3844
03:54:06,440 --> 03:54:08,440
I'll drink for the both of us honestly.

3845
03:54:08,440 --> 03:54:11,440
There's less of you to fill alcohol with.

3846
03:54:14,440 --> 03:54:15,440
Oh, please excuse me.

3847
03:54:15,440 --> 03:54:18,440
I'm holding B, please excuse me.

3848
03:54:19,440 --> 03:54:23,440
Ladies, ladies, sync with me my goodness.

3849
03:54:23,440 --> 03:54:25,440
Work with me here.

3850
03:54:28,440 --> 03:54:30,440
No Guinness for strong.

3851
03:54:30,440 --> 03:54:33,440
I actually like drinking beer.

3852
03:54:34,440 --> 03:54:38,440
It's probably the only thing I can handle at the moment.

3853
03:54:40,440 --> 03:54:42,440
Please remember to drink water if you do drink it.

3854
03:54:42,440 --> 03:54:45,440
Yes, I did not want any issues.

3855
03:54:45,440 --> 03:54:48,440
What's the way to celebrate my birthday?

3856
03:54:48,440 --> 03:54:52,440
Than to join in the brotherhood of man.

3857
03:54:53,440 --> 03:54:56,440
Soon, we will be here once more.

3858
03:54:56,440 --> 03:54:59,440
Celebrating a new night.

3859
03:55:00,440 --> 03:55:06,440
And then the feasting will last for 40 days and 40 nights.

3860
03:55:06,440 --> 03:55:08,440
Not even the girlies drink?

3861
03:55:08,440 --> 03:55:12,440
I mean, Shibi is live right now doing drunk ASMR.

3862
03:55:14,440 --> 03:55:16,440
I don't know, I just never...

3863
03:55:16,440 --> 03:55:19,440
I never had like going out friends.

3864
03:55:19,440 --> 03:55:21,440
Let go like...

3865
03:55:24,440 --> 03:55:27,440
Like nightclub or rave or any of that.

3866
03:55:27,440 --> 03:55:31,440
Which is where a lot of drinking culture comes into play in the UK.

3867
03:55:33,440 --> 03:55:37,440
The aim when you go out with your friends is to get plastered.

3868
03:55:37,440 --> 03:55:41,440
Which is just not very pleasant.

3869
03:55:43,440 --> 03:55:45,440
Chesering full plated armour.

3870
03:55:45,440 --> 03:55:49,440
If only we had a very strong kneecap.

3871
03:55:51,440 --> 03:55:53,440
Sure would be a shame.

3872
03:55:53,440 --> 03:55:55,440
Oh, I did a challenge.

3873
03:55:57,440 --> 03:56:02,440
Right, let's do this without getting in trouble this time.

3874
03:56:04,440 --> 03:56:06,440
You go away.

3875
03:56:06,440 --> 03:56:08,440
Thank you very much.

3876
03:56:08,440 --> 03:56:11,440
Right, and then you stop so I can go in this blend spot.

3877
03:56:11,440 --> 03:56:15,440
No, you're right in front of me. This is what we didn't want last time.

3878
03:56:21,440 --> 03:56:24,440
Half my friend group loved getting hammered and half did not.

3879
03:56:24,440 --> 03:56:28,440
Yeah, like I didn't really experience any of that.

3880
03:56:28,440 --> 03:56:31,440
So it just never really became a thing.

3881
03:56:32,440 --> 03:56:34,440
And like obviously hang up.

3882
03:56:34,440 --> 03:56:36,440
Right, I definitely can do this thing.

3883
03:56:36,440 --> 03:56:38,440
Yeah, okay, easy peasy.

3884
03:56:38,440 --> 03:56:40,440
100% right there.

3885
03:56:42,440 --> 03:56:45,440
I was the Disney driver on my 21st birthday.

3886
03:56:45,440 --> 03:56:52,440
Oh, that's right. 21 is a drinking age in your country.

3887
03:56:56,440 --> 03:56:58,440
Honestly, I'm going to happy here.

3888
03:57:00,440 --> 03:57:02,440
I'm going out or getting good at it.

3889
03:57:02,440 --> 03:57:05,440
It was going out or getting good at AC Brotherhood.

3890
03:57:05,440 --> 03:57:08,440
Literally, I like just play video games all day.

3891
03:57:09,440 --> 03:57:14,440
I'm sure it is fun if you're into it, but like I just have no interest.

3892
03:57:14,440 --> 03:57:19,440
I have an interest in like doing like tipsy streams or like drunk review of movies.

3893
03:57:19,440 --> 03:57:21,440
Okay.

3894
03:57:24,440 --> 03:57:26,440
Not again.

3895
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:32,440
Did it twice.

3896
03:57:32,440 --> 03:57:36,440
I'm sure there's a freaking hay bale down there or something.

3897
03:57:37,440 --> 03:57:39,440
Drinking with good family friends is probably getting me.

3898
03:57:39,440 --> 03:57:41,440
Well, you're getting hammered.

3899
03:57:41,440 --> 03:57:44,440
Well, you were out there getting hammered.

3900
03:57:44,440 --> 03:57:47,440
I was exio al dottori himself.

3901
03:57:47,440 --> 03:57:49,440
Right.

3902
03:57:49,440 --> 03:57:52,440
Wait, those missions only went up to sync to 51%.

3903
03:57:52,440 --> 03:57:56,440
So didn't you, Christina, get unlocked at 50%?

3904
03:57:59,440 --> 03:58:01,440
Oh.

3905
03:58:02,440 --> 03:58:04,440
What do you mean?

3906
03:58:04,440 --> 03:58:07,440
I've only done 50% of the game.

3907
03:58:12,440 --> 03:58:14,440
Ah, right.

3908
03:58:14,440 --> 03:58:17,440
Those ones are difficult, so I actually don't want to do them.

3909
03:58:17,440 --> 03:58:19,440
What's this one?

3910
03:58:19,440 --> 03:58:21,440
The Baron de Voix.

3911
03:58:21,440 --> 03:58:23,440
Gatekeeper 50-50.

3912
03:58:23,440 --> 03:58:25,440
What are you?

3913
03:58:27,440 --> 03:58:29,440
Don't lose any health squares.

3914
03:58:32,440 --> 03:58:33,440
Okay, this one's super easy.

3915
03:58:33,440 --> 03:58:34,440
We can do this one.

3916
03:58:34,440 --> 03:58:37,440
I'm literally doing it easiest to hardest.

3917
03:58:37,440 --> 03:58:39,440
Then we'll get hard at the end.

3918
03:58:41,440 --> 03:58:43,440
How should I beat you first try and get clues?

3919
03:58:43,440 --> 03:58:45,440
Sorry, I need something like that because it's not very nice.

3920
03:58:45,440 --> 03:58:48,440
Because like I completely understand that.

3921
03:58:51,440 --> 03:58:52,440
I did it again.

3922
03:58:52,440 --> 03:58:54,440
It makes that noise.

3923
03:58:54,440 --> 03:58:57,440
I think that must be an audio mistake or something because...

3924
03:58:57,440 --> 03:59:00,440
Your men can overpower the camp's patrols, correct?

3925
03:59:00,440 --> 03:59:01,440
Yes.

3926
03:59:01,440 --> 03:59:03,440
I was studying the hidden bleed.

3927
03:59:03,440 --> 03:59:05,440
I was such an Assassin's Creed fanboy.

3928
03:59:05,440 --> 03:59:12,440
I used to think it would be so cool if I got like the Assassin's Creed logo branded on my finger.

3929
03:59:12,440 --> 03:59:15,440
I was so impressionable as a child.

3930
03:59:15,440 --> 03:59:17,440
You're truly a man after my own heart.

3931
03:59:17,440 --> 03:59:19,440
So impressionable.

3932
03:59:19,440 --> 03:59:20,440
Not very smart.

3933
03:59:20,440 --> 03:59:21,440
It's kind of character.

3934
03:59:21,440 --> 03:59:22,440
I will get the armor.

3935
03:59:22,440 --> 03:59:24,440
My troops will gather it from the dead.

3936
03:59:24,440 --> 03:59:27,440
The stream tomorrow is a native streamer overload.

3937
03:59:27,440 --> 03:59:29,440
Native streamer overload.

3938
03:59:29,440 --> 03:59:31,440
It's actually a pretty good pill for me.

3939
03:59:34,440 --> 03:59:36,440
Next, small fish, the AC logo in tattoo.

3940
03:59:36,440 --> 03:59:39,440
Only refilling Assassins allowed inside.

3941
03:59:41,440 --> 03:59:43,440
Okay, if this is just don't be...

3942
03:59:43,440 --> 03:59:46,440
Actually, well, I am here.

3943
03:59:50,440 --> 03:59:52,440
No, not while I'm here.

3944
03:59:52,440 --> 03:59:53,440
We have to do it outside of the mission.

3945
03:59:53,440 --> 03:59:57,440
No, I always go that way and it's like the longest way to find anyone.

3946
04:00:06,440 --> 04:00:08,440
That's a good reason that young people can't get tattoos.

3947
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:11,440
Yes, I would like to be sitting here with like a freaking branded fingers.

3948
04:00:11,440 --> 04:00:15,440
Probably the Sega logo on me at one point as well for...

3949
04:00:18,440 --> 04:00:20,440
Don't get detected.

3950
04:00:21,440 --> 04:00:24,440
For Sonic Heroes.

3951
04:00:24,440 --> 04:00:26,440
I always loved it when it was like Sega.

3952
04:00:29,440 --> 04:00:31,440
Did that not alert anyone?

3953
04:00:31,440 --> 04:00:34,440
They're actually so efficient at fighting that it didn't alert anyone.

3954
04:00:35,440 --> 04:00:37,440
What do you guys get?

3955
04:00:37,440 --> 04:00:39,440
Okay, Assassins are pretty high level.

3956
04:00:39,440 --> 04:00:41,440
I'm pretty sure they can handle what's going to happen.

3957
04:00:42,440 --> 04:00:44,440
Oh, there's a patrol route.

3958
04:00:44,440 --> 04:00:46,440
Oh, there's a big old fight going on.

3959
04:00:47,440 --> 04:00:50,440
Okay, we're at five costumes.

3960
04:00:50,440 --> 04:00:52,440
They're still going for it.

3961
04:00:52,440 --> 04:00:55,440
Whoa, they're getting beaten up by the big guys.

3962
04:00:57,440 --> 04:00:58,440
Oh, they're fighting back.

3963
04:00:58,440 --> 04:00:59,440
They're beating them up.

3964
04:00:59,440 --> 04:01:01,440
Four to two.

3965
04:01:01,440 --> 04:01:02,440
Oh, she lost the health bar.

3966
04:01:02,440 --> 04:01:04,440
Wow, I actually thought the...

3967
04:01:04,440 --> 04:01:05,440
Oh, they're going for this.

3968
04:01:05,440 --> 04:01:06,440
They're doing it.

3969
04:01:06,440 --> 04:01:07,440
They're doing it.

3970
04:01:07,440 --> 04:01:09,440
They're going for the patrolers as well.

3971
04:01:09,440 --> 04:01:11,440
Oh, we got ten in that one.

3972
04:01:11,440 --> 04:01:13,440
That was a really good one.

3973
04:01:14,440 --> 04:01:15,440
What's over here?

3974
04:01:15,440 --> 04:01:17,440
Another French battalion thing.

3975
04:01:20,440 --> 04:01:22,440
When needy streamer overload, okay.

3976
04:01:22,440 --> 04:01:25,440
I think that's definitely going to be a shorter stream.

3977
04:01:25,440 --> 04:01:27,440
However, when I do have shorter streams,

3978
04:01:27,440 --> 04:01:29,440
I'm going to be working on ASMR collabs and stuff,

3979
04:01:29,440 --> 04:01:31,440
so there's not going to be more content coming.

3980
04:01:32,440 --> 04:01:34,440
I'm going to cry here.

3981
04:01:35,440 --> 04:01:36,440
Let's see.

3982
04:01:39,440 --> 04:01:42,440
Oh, that's actually for two assassins

3983
04:01:42,440 --> 04:01:44,440
to take on that big old group.

3984
04:01:44,440 --> 04:01:45,440
That's quite a lot.

3985
04:01:45,440 --> 04:01:47,440
Yeah, one of them just lost a health bar.

3986
04:01:48,440 --> 04:01:53,440
I actually think I'm going to have to send in more assassins.

3987
04:01:54,440 --> 04:01:56,440
Oh, they've lost two health bars.

3988
04:01:56,440 --> 04:01:58,440
This is getting juicy.

3989
04:01:58,440 --> 04:02:00,440
Oh, the other one's lost one as well.

3990
04:02:01,440 --> 04:02:02,440
Oh, it's getting juicy.

3991
04:02:02,440 --> 04:02:03,440
It's getting juicy.

3992
04:02:03,440 --> 04:02:05,440
Oh, there's losing three.

3993
04:02:05,440 --> 04:02:08,440
I don't want to get detected because that will ruin this little sequence,

3994
04:02:08,440 --> 04:02:10,440
but I will call in the next card.

3995
04:02:11,440 --> 04:02:12,440
There you go.

3996
04:02:12,440 --> 04:02:13,440
There you go.

3997
04:02:14,440 --> 04:02:16,440
I have no idea what's going on over there.

3998
04:02:16,440 --> 04:02:18,440
I don't want to get detected to ruin it, but...

3999
04:02:18,440 --> 04:02:20,440
Oh, he's on two.

4000
04:02:20,440 --> 04:02:21,440
Okay.

4001
04:02:28,440 --> 04:02:29,440
Help him!

4002
04:02:30,440 --> 04:02:31,440
Freaking...

4003
04:02:34,440 --> 04:02:35,440
Ah.

4004
04:02:36,440 --> 04:02:37,440
Jeez.

4005
04:02:37,440 --> 04:02:39,440
Okay, I definitely need to level up the gang

4006
04:02:39,440 --> 04:02:41,440
because they are still not strong enough for this.

4007
04:02:43,440 --> 04:02:44,440
Stop.

4008
04:02:44,440 --> 04:02:45,440
Oh, my goodness.

4009
04:02:45,440 --> 04:02:47,440
No, don't pick on a guard, please.

4010
04:02:54,440 --> 04:02:55,440
Oh, right.

4011
04:02:55,440 --> 04:02:57,440
Everyone despawn right this instant.

4012
04:02:59,440 --> 04:03:00,440
My heart.

4013
04:03:00,440 --> 04:03:01,440
Right.

4014
04:03:01,440 --> 04:03:02,440
They'll heal up.

4015
04:03:02,440 --> 04:03:04,440
Whenever your assassin is low, they'll heal up.

4016
04:03:06,440 --> 04:03:07,440
I thought we lost them.

4017
04:03:07,440 --> 04:03:09,440
Oh, my goodness.

4018
04:03:11,440 --> 04:03:12,440
I thought we...

4019
04:03:12,440 --> 04:03:13,440
I was like...

4020
04:03:13,440 --> 04:03:15,440
I called in another assassin on that guy

4021
04:03:15,440 --> 04:03:17,440
that was in particular his harasser.

4022
04:03:17,440 --> 04:03:18,440
I was like, where are they?

4023
04:03:18,440 --> 04:03:19,440
Where are they?

4024
04:03:19,440 --> 04:03:20,440
Like, where are they going from?

4025
04:03:20,440 --> 04:03:21,440
And I was like, oh, wait.

4026
04:03:21,440 --> 04:03:22,440
I can shoot off my horse.

4027
04:03:22,440 --> 04:03:24,440
Like, I can still attack, technically.

4028
04:03:25,440 --> 04:03:27,440
I just need to not be discovered.

4029
04:03:27,440 --> 04:03:28,440
That's all.

4030
04:03:28,440 --> 04:03:32,440
I'm gonna wait to call in my assassins to do this.

4031
04:03:32,440 --> 04:03:34,440
I really don't want to actually get caught.

4032
04:03:34,440 --> 04:03:36,440
I'll be annoyed at myself if I do.

4033
04:03:37,440 --> 04:03:39,440
There's another guard post all the way over here.

4034
04:03:42,440 --> 04:03:43,440
Excuse me.

4035
04:03:43,440 --> 04:03:44,440
Pardon me, come through.

4036
04:03:46,440 --> 04:03:47,440
Oh, wow.

4037
04:03:47,440 --> 04:03:48,440
Yeah.

4038
04:03:48,440 --> 04:03:50,440
There's a big one over here.

4039
04:03:52,440 --> 04:03:53,440
Maybe...

4040
04:03:53,440 --> 04:03:54,440
Big like mine.

4041
04:03:55,440 --> 04:03:57,440
Okay, let's just send in guards.

4042
04:03:57,440 --> 04:03:58,440
Eh, guards.

4043
04:03:58,440 --> 04:03:59,440
And like this.

4044
04:04:01,440 --> 04:04:02,440
Fill health already.

4045
04:04:02,440 --> 04:04:03,440
There you go.

4046
04:04:03,440 --> 04:04:04,440
Hold on.

4047
04:04:04,440 --> 04:04:05,440
Super simple.

4048
04:04:05,440 --> 04:04:06,440
Super easy.

4049
04:04:06,440 --> 04:04:07,440
Got 100%.

4050
04:04:07,440 --> 04:04:09,440
Literally, that's all I had to do last time.

4051
04:04:09,440 --> 04:04:11,440
I wonder if I didn't have all, I say,

4052
04:04:11,440 --> 04:04:12,440
a...

4053
04:04:12,440 --> 04:04:13,440
Signals?

4054
04:04:13,440 --> 04:04:14,440
Um...

4055
04:04:14,440 --> 04:04:15,440
Doing.

4056
04:04:15,440 --> 04:04:17,440
Oh, no, my track is bugging out again.

4057
04:04:17,440 --> 04:04:18,440
Please stop.

4058
04:04:18,440 --> 04:04:19,440
What's this one?

4059
04:04:19,440 --> 04:04:21,440
Don't take any damage.

4060
04:04:21,440 --> 04:04:23,440
Don't lose any health squares.

4061
04:04:24,440 --> 04:04:26,440
That one's not easy

4062
04:04:26,440 --> 04:04:29,440
because of how many enemies can just swing at you.

4063
04:04:29,440 --> 04:04:31,440
And that first one...

4064
04:04:33,440 --> 04:04:34,440
I'll try it.

4065
04:04:35,440 --> 04:04:38,440
Do I plan on unlocking all the endings on Needy Streamer?

4066
04:04:38,440 --> 04:04:40,440
I don't know how much I'm gonna like it.

4067
04:04:40,440 --> 04:04:42,440
I'm gonna play it for the first time.

4068
04:04:42,440 --> 04:04:44,440
I think it's like a click game, which honestly

4069
04:04:44,440 --> 04:04:46,440
might make it super simple.

4070
04:04:46,440 --> 04:04:48,440
If I like it, then I'll try and get all endings

4071
04:04:48,440 --> 04:04:49,440
if I don't like it.

4072
04:04:49,440 --> 04:04:51,440
And then I'll probably just do a few runs and then

4073
04:04:51,440 --> 04:04:54,440
have a short stream and then I'll work on ASMR.

4074
04:04:54,440 --> 04:04:55,440
That sounds like a deal.

4075
04:04:56,440 --> 04:04:57,440
Surprise me.

4076
04:04:57,440 --> 04:04:59,440
The French puttane have us under pressure.

4077
04:04:59,440 --> 04:05:01,440
Tell me about their general.

4078
04:05:01,440 --> 04:05:02,440
These...

4079
04:05:02,440 --> 04:05:03,440
Baron de Valois.

4080
04:05:04,440 --> 04:05:06,440
Some major is just the, like,

4081
04:05:06,440 --> 04:05:08,440
the hmm option.

4082
04:05:09,440 --> 04:05:10,440
And over and over again.

4083
04:05:10,440 --> 04:05:11,440
Where can I find him?

4084
04:05:11,440 --> 04:05:12,440
To watch the bed.

4085
04:05:12,440 --> 04:05:14,440
Wait, do I need to censor the stream?

4086
04:05:15,440 --> 04:05:17,440
Is it safe to stream it?

4087
04:05:17,440 --> 04:05:19,440
They seem to be getting closer.

4088
04:05:19,440 --> 04:05:21,440
The situation is under control.

4089
04:05:22,440 --> 04:05:23,440
Close the gates!

4090
04:05:23,440 --> 04:05:24,440
Needy Strony overload.

4091
04:05:24,440 --> 04:05:26,440
Oh, I should have named it that.

4092
04:05:26,440 --> 04:05:27,440
I'm taking that.

4093
04:05:27,440 --> 04:05:28,440
Thank you.

4094
04:05:28,440 --> 04:05:29,440
No, you can do it.

4095
04:05:29,440 --> 04:05:30,440
Okay.

4096
04:05:30,440 --> 04:05:31,440
Right.

4097
04:05:31,440 --> 04:05:32,440
Don't take any damage.

4098
04:05:36,440 --> 04:05:37,440
I'm gonna do that.

4099
04:05:38,440 --> 04:05:40,440
So that stops them.

4100
04:05:41,440 --> 04:05:43,440
Okay, that's what I'm nervous about.

4101
04:05:43,440 --> 04:05:44,440
Them doing that.

4102
04:05:44,440 --> 04:05:46,440
And I don't have a freaking smoke bomb.

4103
04:05:46,440 --> 04:05:47,440
I have...

4104
04:05:47,440 --> 04:05:49,440
I don't have any more smoke bombs.

4105
04:05:50,440 --> 04:05:52,440
Right.

4106
04:05:52,440 --> 04:05:55,440
Oh, I think I might need to...

4107
04:05:55,440 --> 04:05:57,440
Oh, I can call in my recruits.

4108
04:05:59,440 --> 04:06:00,440
Oh, my God.

4109
04:06:00,440 --> 04:06:01,440
Please don't attack me.

4110
04:06:01,440 --> 04:06:03,440
I really don't want to lose health over this.

4111
04:06:05,440 --> 04:06:08,440
I can't see because of the camera angle.

4112
04:06:10,440 --> 04:06:11,440
I'm scared.

4113
04:06:11,440 --> 04:06:12,440
I'm scared.

4114
04:06:12,440 --> 04:06:13,440
I'm going for it.

4115
04:06:13,440 --> 04:06:14,440
I'm sending it.

4116
04:06:14,440 --> 04:06:15,440
I'm sending it.

4117
04:06:15,440 --> 04:06:16,440
Please don't attack me.

4118
04:06:16,440 --> 04:06:17,440
Please don't attack me.

4119
04:06:18,440 --> 04:06:20,440
Okay, my assassin recruits are going ham.

4120
04:06:20,440 --> 04:06:21,440
That's what I like to see.

4121
04:06:24,440 --> 04:06:26,440
They're stuck outside.

4122
04:06:28,440 --> 04:06:29,440
Assassin, please.

4123
04:06:29,440 --> 04:06:30,440
Jeez.

4124
04:06:30,440 --> 04:06:32,440
Are you trying to make me lose?

4125
04:06:33,440 --> 04:06:34,440
Jeez.

4126
04:06:34,440 --> 04:06:36,440
Is there anyone else?

4127
04:06:39,440 --> 04:06:40,440
Wait, what?

4128
04:06:40,440 --> 04:06:41,440
On air?

4129
04:06:42,440 --> 04:06:44,440
I've never seen this before.

4130
04:06:45,440 --> 04:06:47,440
I guess I'll just...

4131
04:06:47,440 --> 04:06:49,440
Wait, they keep seeing me, though.

4132
04:06:49,440 --> 04:06:50,440
I can't...

4133
04:06:50,440 --> 04:06:53,440
So the AI can't actually see me,

4134
04:06:53,440 --> 04:06:55,440
but it keeps claiming it is.

4135
04:06:55,440 --> 04:06:56,440
It's not.

4136
04:06:56,440 --> 04:06:58,440
I think I'm just going to shoot them.

4137
04:06:59,440 --> 04:07:00,440
I can.

4138
04:07:00,440 --> 04:07:01,440
Oh, I can.

4139
04:07:01,440 --> 04:07:02,440
I'm getting them.

4140
04:07:03,440 --> 04:07:04,440
Okay, that was...

4141
04:07:04,440 --> 04:07:05,440
Okay, we did it.

4142
04:07:05,440 --> 04:07:06,440
We did it.

4143
04:07:06,440 --> 04:07:07,440
We did it.

4144
04:07:10,440 --> 04:07:11,440
It's just heavily implied.

4145
04:07:11,440 --> 04:07:12,440
It's more of a win-win-win-nothing.

4146
04:07:12,440 --> 04:07:13,440
Okay.

4147
04:07:15,440 --> 04:07:17,440
He did it too well.

4148
04:07:19,440 --> 04:07:20,440
He dumped people in us.

4149
04:07:21,440 --> 04:07:23,440
Blame them with your ink.

4150
04:07:26,440 --> 04:07:27,440
Maybe I should have had an ink toy,

4151
04:07:27,440 --> 04:07:29,440
but what would have been funny is anything.

4152
04:07:29,440 --> 04:07:30,440
Like, I'd just go...

4153
04:07:30,440 --> 04:07:32,440
And it was all in screen.

4154
04:07:33,440 --> 04:07:34,440
Oh, no!

4155
04:07:46,440 --> 04:07:48,440
Didn't the developers also make another game?

4156
04:07:49,440 --> 04:07:50,440
A whale after?

4157
04:07:50,440 --> 04:07:51,440
Oh, I think so.

4158
04:07:52,440 --> 04:07:53,440
Hello!

4159
04:07:53,440 --> 04:07:54,440
Hello, everyone!

4160
04:07:55,440 --> 04:07:56,440
How are you?

4161
04:07:57,440 --> 04:07:58,440
Today...

4162
04:07:58,440 --> 04:07:59,440
I...

4163
04:08:01,440 --> 04:08:02,440
I...

4164
04:08:02,440 --> 04:08:03,440
I...

4165
04:08:03,440 --> 04:08:04,440
I...

4166
04:08:04,440 --> 04:08:05,440
I...

4167
04:08:05,440 --> 04:08:06,440
I...

4168
04:08:06,440 --> 04:08:07,440
I...

4169
04:08:07,440 --> 04:08:08,440
I...

4170
04:08:08,440 --> 04:08:09,440
I...

4171
04:08:12,440 --> 04:08:14,440
Yeah, I can't speak none of that.

4172
04:08:17,440 --> 04:08:18,440
Okay.

4173
04:08:18,440 --> 04:08:20,440
Okay, I think we just need to go back and forth

4174
04:08:20,440 --> 04:08:22,440
and not get attacked by anything,

4175
04:08:22,440 --> 04:08:23,440
which is super simple.

4176
04:08:29,440 --> 04:08:30,440
Oops.

4177
04:08:33,440 --> 04:08:35,440
Maybe part of a 2.0 or a new output.

4178
04:08:35,440 --> 04:08:36,440
Why is your French so good?

4179
04:08:36,440 --> 04:08:37,440
No, it's nothing else.

4180
04:08:39,440 --> 04:08:41,440
Don't understand the French.

4181
04:08:41,440 --> 04:08:43,440
No, I don't understand it.

4182
04:08:43,440 --> 04:08:44,440
Oh, no, my eyes.

4183
04:08:44,440 --> 04:08:45,440
Sorry, sorry.

4184
04:08:45,440 --> 04:08:46,440
Sorry.

4185
04:08:48,440 --> 04:08:49,440
I actually don't know any French.

4186
04:08:49,440 --> 04:08:51,440
I literally know phrases.

4187
04:08:51,440 --> 04:08:53,440
And I record to take the same phrases.

4188
04:08:54,440 --> 04:08:57,440
If you would like to order a ham and cheese baguette,

4189
04:08:57,440 --> 04:08:58,440
you say...

4190
04:09:04,440 --> 04:09:06,440
I forgot what cheese is.

4191
04:09:06,440 --> 04:09:07,440
A baguette.

4192
04:09:10,440 --> 04:09:11,440
Well, that didn't...

4193
04:09:11,440 --> 04:09:13,440
That didn't work out very well.

4194
04:09:13,440 --> 04:09:14,440
No.

4195
04:09:14,440 --> 04:09:15,440
Baguette.

4196
04:09:17,440 --> 04:09:19,440
Well, it sounds good coming from a French speaker.

4197
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:21,440
Oh, thank you.

4198
04:09:21,440 --> 04:09:23,440
How are you doing?

4199
04:09:24,440 --> 04:09:25,440
How are you?

4200
04:09:25,440 --> 04:09:26,440
Huh?

4201
04:09:26,440 --> 04:09:27,440
Are you okay?

4202
04:09:27,440 --> 04:09:28,440
Oh, wait, that was for a joke.

4203
04:09:31,440 --> 04:09:32,440
What's the French password?

4204
04:09:32,440 --> 04:09:33,440
Hmm...

4205
04:09:33,440 --> 04:09:34,440
I don't know.

4206
04:09:34,440 --> 04:09:36,440
I don't know.

4207
04:09:36,440 --> 04:09:37,440
One...

4208
04:09:37,440 --> 04:09:38,440
Two...

4209
04:09:38,440 --> 04:09:39,440
One baguette.

4210
04:09:39,440 --> 04:09:40,440
And one...

4211
04:09:40,440 --> 04:09:41,440
Ramon.

4212
04:09:42,440 --> 04:09:44,440
Who wants me to play with you?

4213
04:09:50,440 --> 04:09:52,440
That's like, I'm literally just regurgitating.

4214
04:09:52,440 --> 04:09:54,440
Do I have higher education?

4215
04:09:54,440 --> 04:09:56,440
That sounds like I have higher education.

4216
04:09:56,440 --> 04:09:57,440
That's just new.

4217
04:09:58,440 --> 04:09:59,440
Reason of barn.

4218
04:09:59,440 --> 04:10:01,440
Uneducated in the barn.

4219
04:10:01,440 --> 04:10:02,440
And became a gamer.

4220
04:10:02,440 --> 04:10:03,440
Hell yeah.

4221
04:10:08,440 --> 04:10:09,440
Ray.

4222
04:10:09,440 --> 04:10:11,440
I'm a bit scared of this one.

4223
04:10:11,440 --> 04:10:13,440
Don't lose any health squares.

4224
04:10:16,440 --> 04:10:18,440
I actually don't want to do that one

4225
04:10:18,440 --> 04:10:19,440
because it takes too long.

4226
04:10:19,440 --> 04:10:21,440
Right, we're at 52%.

4227
04:10:21,440 --> 04:10:22,440
So every time I do a memory,

4228
04:10:22,440 --> 04:10:25,440
I'm getting like up to 5%.

4229
04:10:26,440 --> 04:10:29,440
Use assassin recruits to do your targets.

4230
04:10:29,440 --> 04:10:32,440
Okay, we're actually factually

4231
04:10:32,440 --> 04:10:35,440
going to upgrade our assassin recruits.

4232
04:10:35,440 --> 04:10:36,440
Which...

4233
04:10:36,440 --> 04:10:37,440
Sorry, I just closed this,

4234
04:10:37,440 --> 04:10:39,440
but we actually needed to open it.

4235
04:10:40,440 --> 04:10:43,440
If I do this, they get...

4236
04:10:44,440 --> 04:10:46,440
Okay, we just need to send them on missions.

4237
04:10:46,440 --> 04:10:49,440
If we get 5 assassins level 10,

4238
04:10:49,440 --> 04:10:52,440
the assassin's recruit signal

4239
04:10:52,440 --> 04:10:54,440
replenishes so much faster.

4240
04:10:54,440 --> 04:10:57,440
I think it takes off like 20 seconds.

4241
04:10:57,440 --> 04:10:59,440
Which, in the grand scheme of things,

4242
04:10:59,440 --> 04:11:01,440
like adds up so quickly.

4243
04:11:01,440 --> 04:11:03,440
How much money do I have on my purseings?

4244
04:11:04,440 --> 04:11:07,440
13k, right, I don't have enough right.

4245
04:11:07,440 --> 04:11:09,440
We'll just go and...

4246
04:11:09,440 --> 04:11:11,440
We'll send them on...

4247
04:11:11,440 --> 04:11:12,440
Missions.

4248
04:11:13,440 --> 04:11:15,440
Like the pigeons.

4249
04:11:15,440 --> 04:11:18,440
Oh, it was like dead ahead, dead center.

4250
04:11:18,440 --> 04:11:20,440
I remembered an Italian swear.

4251
04:11:20,440 --> 04:11:22,440
I'll use it in a sentence.

4252
04:11:22,440 --> 04:11:26,440
I didn't even know that.

4253
04:11:26,440 --> 04:11:27,440
I know catso.

4254
04:11:27,440 --> 04:11:29,440
And merda.

4255
04:11:29,440 --> 04:11:32,440
Oh, we put 50 grand in the bank?

4256
04:11:32,440 --> 04:11:34,440
50 smacaroons.

4257
04:11:34,440 --> 04:11:37,440
Right, we're going to send away our agents.

4258
04:11:37,440 --> 04:11:39,440
Because I want some of them to level up

4259
04:11:39,440 --> 04:11:41,440
so then we can get faster.

4260
04:11:44,440 --> 04:11:46,440
I have no one at 10 yet.

4261
04:11:46,440 --> 04:11:47,440
What?

4262
04:11:47,440 --> 04:11:48,440
You guys...

4263
04:11:48,440 --> 04:11:50,440
Oh, you're getting close.

4264
04:11:50,440 --> 04:11:52,440
Right, I just need to send them away.

4265
04:11:52,440 --> 04:11:55,440
Maybe do a mission that doesn't require them.

4266
04:11:56,440 --> 04:11:58,440
And then we can get the...

4267
04:11:59,440 --> 04:12:00,440
Upgrade.

4268
04:12:00,440 --> 04:12:03,440
5, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

4269
04:12:03,440 --> 04:12:05,440
If you guys all go...

4270
04:12:06,440 --> 04:12:08,440
I think...

4271
04:12:08,440 --> 04:12:10,440
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

4272
04:12:10,440 --> 04:12:12,440
Oh, I don't want to risk the room.

4273
04:12:12,440 --> 04:12:14,440
If it fails...

4274
04:12:14,440 --> 04:12:17,440
I'm like 99% sure they come back all perished.

4275
04:12:17,440 --> 04:12:21,440
If it fails, which is like pretty unforgiven.

4276
04:12:23,440 --> 04:12:25,440
Honestly, your openness and no manners

4277
04:12:25,440 --> 04:12:27,440
is one of the reasons why I like...

4278
04:12:30,440 --> 04:12:32,440
Oh, that's funny.

4279
04:12:36,440 --> 04:12:38,440
Right, missions, missions, missions.

4280
04:12:38,440 --> 04:12:40,440
Wait, they don't have...

4281
04:12:42,440 --> 04:12:45,440
17 minutes for that mission?

4282
04:12:45,440 --> 04:12:47,440
Is really not.

4283
04:12:47,440 --> 04:12:51,440
Is there not another level 5 regular contract?

4284
04:12:53,440 --> 04:12:54,440
There's no...

4285
04:12:54,440 --> 04:12:56,440
Oh, these are all level 5s.

4286
04:12:56,440 --> 04:12:59,440
All four of you go together.

4287
04:12:59,440 --> 04:13:01,440
And you're humble, little thing.

4288
04:13:05,440 --> 04:13:07,440
Alright, as an Italian myself,

4289
04:13:07,440 --> 04:13:09,440
I have to say here in the dub for Italian phrases

4290
04:13:09,440 --> 04:13:11,440
another language is cringe.

4291
04:13:11,440 --> 04:13:13,440
Oh, you don't want to hear me say

4292
04:13:13,440 --> 04:13:17,440
Spingy, Spingy, Ayuto, Ayuto!

4293
04:13:17,440 --> 04:13:20,440
Ayus meus, Dios me...

4294
04:13:20,440 --> 04:13:22,440
Wait, no, that's Spanish.

4295
04:13:23,440 --> 04:13:25,440
Right, we're going to go to a bank.

4296
04:13:26,440 --> 04:13:29,440
Ummmmm

4297
04:13:29,440 --> 04:13:33,440
the Bangkok, Bangkok, Bangkok, Bangkok

4298
04:13:34,440 --> 04:13:36,440
As in Italian you tell, please say more Italian words.

4299
04:13:36,440 --> 04:13:40,440
Ayye, Ay... Ayus, meuls!

4300
04:13:42,440 --> 04:13:43,440
To say...

4301
04:13:44,440 --> 04:13:46,440
I don't think I have any Italian word.

4302
04:13:47,440 --> 04:13:50,440
I'm ready for a little nap after eating all those little snacks.

4303
04:13:50,440 --> 04:13:51,440
I still have P-Snacks left over.

4304
04:13:51,440 --> 04:13:53,440
I forgot to eat any of my rice.

4305
04:13:53,440 --> 04:14:01,680
I'm gonna have to put them back in the fridge. Oh, I need to buy paintings wait the paintings question mark and go to DNA

4306
04:14:03,840 --> 04:14:09,580
Fifty-two four seven fifty-two four seven fifty-two four seven fifty-two

4307
04:14:12,520 --> 04:14:14,520
Four seven fifty-two

4308
04:14:18,520 --> 04:14:22,200
Spend all my money on London, oh, excuse me you're in my way

4309
04:14:23,440 --> 04:14:25,440
I

4310
04:14:33,800 --> 04:14:38,920
Just need to access the bank over here. I don't mind get a little wet. Why not we

4311
04:14:44,760 --> 04:14:48,360
That's my favorite food chatting has to be chicken

4312
04:14:49,360 --> 04:14:53,920
It's too tasty, I don't know. I just did something. I like savory foods over sweet foods

4313
04:14:56,440 --> 04:14:58,440
Savory is just dab on

4314
04:15:00,000 --> 04:15:02,720
Flags feathers and chest today

4315
04:15:03,400 --> 04:15:09,200
to flag go to the percentage because I feel like the DNA sequence doesn't is like so

4316
04:15:11,960 --> 04:15:15,440
Rough colonel standards use that something I can't do that. Just yeah

4317
04:15:15,440 --> 04:15:20,400
Don't be detected like I don't like the

4318
04:15:21,680 --> 04:15:24,920
Beat Chesery to the apple of Eden. Don't hurt anyone

4319
04:15:29,240 --> 04:15:31,240
Cuz they're all attacking you

4320
04:15:34,080 --> 04:15:37,400
Beat Chesery to the apple Eden don't hurt anyone

4321
04:15:46,440 --> 04:15:52,260
Mmm, I have my hand over my mouth thinking I'm oh, I don't have any smoke bombs

4322
04:15:55,560 --> 04:16:01,060
I don't have any smoke bombs on my person so I can't get away with that fried all fried by far

4323
04:16:05,640 --> 04:16:10,680
Yeah, for sure, would you like if you heard an Italian speak your navel image sure might not be some bad

4324
04:16:11,000 --> 04:16:13,240
But you know the accent can pack a punch

4325
04:16:14,120 --> 04:16:16,120
Oh

4326
04:16:19,040 --> 04:16:21,040
So

4327
04:16:21,840 --> 04:16:27,560
Okay, yeah, the layers of Romeo the war machine. Oh, oh

4328
04:16:30,000 --> 04:16:32,000
Wait, do these have a percentage

4329
04:16:34,480 --> 04:16:36,480
No, these don't have a percentage

4330
04:16:37,360 --> 04:16:39,360
Oh

4331
04:16:43,600 --> 04:16:46,280
Okay, this is why our thing is so low

4332
04:16:48,880 --> 04:16:55,680
Okay, okay, we're gonna do assassin's contracts wherever the heck they are that's why the freaking percentage is so low

4333
04:16:56,480 --> 04:16:58,080
these

4334
04:16:58,080 --> 04:16:59,360
symbols

4335
04:16:59,360 --> 04:17:01,360
the pigeon

4336
04:17:02,240 --> 04:17:06,900
Like these ones is it that assassin contract, right? Okay. Okay. I

4337
04:17:07,760 --> 04:17:12,760
Was gonna say because it's not making a lot of sense why the percentage is so low

4338
04:17:12,760 --> 04:17:15,800
There's only a few missions that haven't done a hundred percent on

4339
04:17:16,880 --> 04:17:21,840
I'm gonna be honest and I don't think we're gonna hundred percent it

4340
04:17:21,840 --> 04:17:25,200
But we definitely finished the game and I'm sat aside

4341
04:17:26,200 --> 04:17:31,320
That after like the stream, we don't need to hop back on black a on black ops on brotherhood

4342
04:17:34,840 --> 04:17:38,840
Hey, cuz I'm satisfied with the play through

4343
04:17:41,440 --> 04:17:45,800
Cuz yeah, I don't actually have much me okay, so I just need to kind of do all the

4344
04:17:46,560 --> 04:17:54,020
Black markers on the map really maybe factions also half of it if I get like a hundred percent favor in the factions as well

4345
04:17:56,200 --> 04:17:58,920
Okay, see yummy, honestly

4346
04:18:02,400 --> 04:18:05,840
It's been very close it's it's more of a cozy day

4347
04:18:05,840 --> 04:18:08,840
I think yesterday like I used up a lot of my energy on a rifle

4348
04:18:09,120 --> 04:18:12,720
Just like being like gushing about this game and being like it's getting so cool

4349
04:18:15,040 --> 04:18:19,840
Today it's like it's definitely cozy. It's definitely have a little blankie on you and make sure you're comfy

4350
04:18:20,600 --> 04:18:21,800
I

4351
04:18:21,800 --> 04:18:27,280
Yesterday I was screaming my head off like just loving everything and so energetic

4352
04:18:28,040 --> 04:18:32,960
But like that get to be like that unapologetically cuz like nothing's worse than like

4353
04:18:34,080 --> 04:18:36,760
being excited for something and then

4354
04:18:37,520 --> 04:18:42,880
Someone's like, oh, you're being really loud and obnoxious. So just like kills like oh, this is a lot of me

4355
04:18:42,880 --> 04:18:46,960
Like I'm having such a good time. You never met someone who's like genuinely excited for

4356
04:18:47,160 --> 04:18:55,200
Yes faction challenges are also part of the percentage of the contract no not like contract

4357
04:18:56,720 --> 04:18:58,720
Mission

4358
04:19:01,200 --> 04:19:06,000
Chesery hopes that our rebels will stumble into his line of fire his expected come and wait instructions

4359
04:19:07,280 --> 04:19:13,040
Kill the three targets in two minutes. Oh my god. These have freaking things as well

4360
04:19:13,840 --> 04:19:22,080
Oh, okay, I'm starting to understand why our DNA think is so unbelievably low

4361
04:19:33,920 --> 04:19:35,920
Oh, he's just that range

4362
04:19:36,560 --> 04:19:42,880
Wait under three minutes three gunmen and under

4363
04:19:45,360 --> 04:19:49,600
They're not that far away. Okay, I guess the assassin's contracts are super nice

4364
04:19:50,400 --> 04:19:55,440
Because this guy's on that far away. Oh like that was like super reasonable

4365
04:20:02,400 --> 04:20:04,400
Oh, I can't reach that

4366
04:20:06,240 --> 04:20:08,240
Oh

4367
04:20:09,760 --> 04:20:11,760
That quick

4368
04:20:12,320 --> 04:20:18,320
Okay, I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'll I'll I'll meet ankles

4369
04:20:19,440 --> 04:20:22,880
I'm out of medicine. Oh and smoke worms

4370
04:20:24,640 --> 04:20:26,640
Oh, there's a doctor over here. That's perfect

4371
04:20:26,640 --> 04:20:28,640
Oh

4372
04:20:35,360 --> 04:20:37,360
What was out of medicine

4373
04:20:39,440 --> 04:20:47,200
I've seen the thing is I don't look soldiers bodies so I don't get anything from him. He'll heal me. You should heal myself. No

4374
04:20:52,080 --> 04:20:54,320
Do the feathers count as DNA or possibly

4375
04:20:55,280 --> 04:20:57,280
You don't need ankle

4376
04:20:58,160 --> 04:21:02,400
Right, so literally just do the pigeon clips and then it's going up

4377
04:21:03,760 --> 04:21:09,600
Oh, yeah, 53 percent. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let him get up. Let him get up 53 percent. Uh, how do you go up there?

4378
04:21:11,200 --> 04:21:16,000
That looks like a hell to me. It looks like a bit of an in slope a bit of an incline

4379
04:21:16,000 --> 04:21:18,000
I

4380
04:21:24,400 --> 04:21:27,360
Think tomorrow I'm going to say

4381
04:21:28,400 --> 04:21:32,160
Which means I need to take a shower put deodorant on

4382
04:21:33,520 --> 04:21:35,520
I need to pretend

4383
04:21:35,520 --> 04:21:37,520
I'm a normal person

4384
04:21:37,840 --> 04:21:42,000
I'm teasing. I do not stink all the time. Wait. What was 100 percent?

4385
04:21:42,960 --> 04:21:48,720
Assassinate three guards with a hidden blade. You do not have to tell me anything more. I assure you

4386
04:21:49,840 --> 04:21:51,840
Hidden blade is wiggle

4387
04:21:57,520 --> 04:21:58,720
Oh

4388
04:21:58,720 --> 04:22:00,720
They're on horsies

4389
04:22:00,960 --> 04:22:02,960
I love when they're on horsies

4390
04:22:03,040 --> 04:22:08,960
Hello, would you like to die? I oh, okay. Hold on. Let me try the game. Would you like to die?

4391
04:22:09,920 --> 04:22:11,680
One

4392
04:22:11,680 --> 04:22:17,760
They're all on horses. No wonder the game's like do they're all on horses. How am I supposed to do this?

4393
04:22:18,960 --> 04:22:20,960
Hello, would you like to die?

4394
04:22:21,200 --> 04:22:23,200
Hello, would you like to die? No

4395
04:22:23,440 --> 04:22:25,760
Yes, wait, I did it 100 percent already

4396
04:22:26,480 --> 04:22:30,800
Skill okay. Wait. Wait. Hold on. It's fine. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic. Let him get up

4397
04:22:30,800 --> 04:22:33,440
Let him get up. Oh, no, no, no. Don't spank the horse

4398
04:22:34,880 --> 04:22:36,480
Wait, wait, wait. Get him because he's got a bow

4399
04:22:37,120 --> 04:22:40,080
Why does it not? Do I need to like jump up onto the horse?

4400
04:22:42,960 --> 04:22:44,960
Ow, you're hurting me

4401
04:22:46,000 --> 04:22:47,280
Okay

4402
04:22:47,280 --> 04:22:51,760
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me cook. Let me cook. Yes. They got off the horse by automatic

4403
04:22:54,160 --> 04:22:56,880
Okay, easy peasy lemon squeezy. You're next

4404
04:22:57,680 --> 04:22:58,880
No, you're not

4405
04:22:58,880 --> 04:23:00,880
Are you coming?

4406
04:23:01,040 --> 04:23:06,080
Yes, there. Get him. Three, two, one. Oh, oh, I missed it. I missed it. I missed the timing source

4407
04:23:08,640 --> 04:23:10,640
It's never too late

4408
04:23:11,360 --> 04:23:13,360
Hope the weather's nicer for you. It's mild

4409
04:23:14,160 --> 04:23:16,160
33 degrees

4410
04:23:19,840 --> 04:23:24,960
That's too much for me. I'll I'll pass right. I guess we're gonna do Leonardo as well

4411
04:23:25,840 --> 04:23:27,840
Oh

4412
04:23:28,640 --> 04:23:33,040
Right, there's another one if we do that the assassin mission seemed like super fair

4413
04:23:34,160 --> 04:23:38,000
Some of it buys for them right now and we can generate more money by sending

4414
04:23:38,720 --> 04:23:42,800
Are we assassins to get more exp? I'm gonna need a horse for this

4415
04:23:44,880 --> 04:23:51,120
I said I'm gonna need to wait. I'm blind. I just passed off on the horse. Sorry mate. My apologies

4416
04:23:55,760 --> 04:24:00,720
Uh, if it's super easy to do the assassin contracts, we'll just do them get them out of the way and then

4417
04:24:01,520 --> 04:24:04,320
Hopefully that's like our percentage raised by like five

4418
04:24:05,440 --> 04:24:07,440
That's pretty good

4419
04:24:11,520 --> 04:24:14,880
Uh, actually I could also use these mercenaries

4420
04:24:16,480 --> 04:24:18,480
Well, I can't right now

4421
04:24:19,360 --> 04:24:21,360
Uh

4422
04:24:22,320 --> 04:24:23,680
We're just

4423
04:24:23,680 --> 04:24:29,680
Trying to do what we can. It's very unlikely. We're gonna 100% it, but I'm enjoying myself thoroughly

4424
04:24:30,000 --> 04:24:36,000
Uh, I'm actually gonna go get a blanket because I'm putting my legs on the table and I'm killing circulation to my leg

4425
04:24:36,080 --> 04:24:38,320
I'll just be a second. I don't need to mute so you can

4426
04:24:39,280 --> 04:24:41,280
Uh, was it

4427
04:24:48,480 --> 04:24:50,480
I

4428
04:25:12,560 --> 04:25:15,360
Have my lovely blanket to protect my leg

4429
04:25:15,680 --> 04:25:19,200
Because the circulation is dying because I pressed them so hard against the table

4430
04:25:19,840 --> 04:25:23,200
They ain't sitting on my feet. I'm cutting the circulation out of my leg

4431
04:25:28,880 --> 04:25:30,880
All right, my chair is like so quicky

4432
04:25:35,280 --> 04:25:40,000
Right have we got any level 10? No we don't. It was a smaller mission

4433
04:25:40,000 --> 04:25:42,000
I

4434
04:25:44,640 --> 04:25:46,640
Screen shot that

4435
04:25:49,120 --> 04:25:51,120
That's an interesting

4436
04:25:52,560 --> 04:25:56,960
I'm supposed to close my eyes before I leave like so the thing looks right, but

4437
04:26:00,000 --> 04:26:02,000
I'm just gonna keep sending people to

4438
04:26:02,960 --> 04:26:04,640
Do more um

4439
04:26:04,640 --> 04:26:09,200
Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb. I was supposed to accept uh, assassination contract

4440
04:26:10,720 --> 04:26:12,720
missions

4441
04:26:12,880 --> 04:26:14,400
The ball on the

4442
04:26:14,400 --> 04:26:19,200
Choose company kill both targets for your hidden belief. You do not have to tell me twice

4443
04:26:20,080 --> 04:26:24,400
I'm loving these assassin missions. Are you joking me?

4444
04:26:27,120 --> 04:26:29,920
I assume I don't have to get on a horse to reach them

4445
04:26:32,400 --> 04:26:34,400
But we're getting pretty far

4446
04:26:35,360 --> 04:26:39,280
Uh, I can't tell which one's closer

4447
04:26:41,680 --> 04:26:43,680
Eh, what is this?

4448
04:26:44,480 --> 04:26:50,000
The wheat. Oh, wow. They're like, okay, actually it's closer to a door than four. Let's do that

4449
04:26:52,560 --> 04:26:54,960
By Austria and Switzerland just 26 right now

4450
04:26:54,960 --> 04:26:56,960
Oh

4451
04:26:59,760 --> 04:27:05,280
Literally the assassin missions are like so easy and like um, um, we might be like 57

4452
04:27:06,080 --> 04:27:09,040
Once by the time we're finished them if they make them this easy then

4453
04:27:09,760 --> 04:27:11,760
Yeah

4454
04:27:15,200 --> 04:27:16,960
If you die

4455
04:27:16,960 --> 04:27:22,960
Your assassin rule before promoting them a max their cape match will be that color. I have no sense

4456
04:27:25,920 --> 04:27:27,920
Wait that

4457
04:27:29,600 --> 04:27:38,480
Assassin contracts are so easy. I love it here. What the heck no like don't be detected and there's 18 billion like guards looking at you

4458
04:27:39,680 --> 04:27:45,440
Shout out to assassin contracts. Hello. I can't believe how easy these are

4459
04:27:48,960 --> 04:27:51,920
Oh, excuse me mr. Horsey yet in Maui

4460
04:27:52,880 --> 04:27:59,840
The 68% finish is that where we'll end on 60% I'll give the Leonardo missions ago

4461
04:28:05,760 --> 04:28:08,480
It would be nice 100% but my goodness, I didn't know

4462
04:28:09,920 --> 04:28:16,080
I'll see what happens by the end of this stream like I didn't I thought I was only going to do six hours today

4463
04:28:16,480 --> 04:28:18,480
Hi, I'm sorry

4464
04:28:18,560 --> 04:28:20,400
Bye

4465
04:28:20,560 --> 04:28:22,560
Um

4466
04:28:23,680 --> 04:28:25,680
What percentage are we now in like 54

4467
04:28:27,360 --> 04:28:34,320
55 I love it here says 55. Oh my god more contact. Please. They're so easy. Is there any more?

4468
04:28:35,840 --> 04:28:37,680
No, but there's

4469
04:28:37,680 --> 04:28:39,680
Templar agents

4470
04:28:39,920 --> 04:28:46,160
Okay, we're going to do Templar agents. I'm totally not stalling on the Leonardo missions because I know they're a bit tricky

4471
04:28:50,960 --> 04:28:56,880
Last Christina needs 75 percent. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're gonna do it. We're gonna do it

4472
04:28:57,520 --> 04:29:01,360
I mean, honestly, it might be one of those things where I'm like

4473
04:29:02,400 --> 04:29:04,400
We'll do what we can

4474
04:29:04,720 --> 04:29:06,720
I actually don't know how long we're gonna

4475
04:29:07,520 --> 04:29:12,000
Like stream today. As I said, I was only planning on doing

4476
04:29:13,680 --> 04:29:16,880
Six hours ish, but I mean we're already getting close to that mark

4477
04:29:16,960 --> 04:29:24,320
It's already been four hours and a half. Yeah, and I'm like I don't really feel like I'm out of stamina right now

4478
04:29:24,800 --> 04:29:25,600
for stream

4479
04:29:25,600 --> 04:29:26,400
so

4480
04:29:26,400 --> 04:29:28,400
Yeah, and like especially tomorrow

4481
04:29:28,880 --> 04:29:33,680
Depended on like how much I like the game. It might only be a tour stream which kind of is a bit meh

4482
04:29:34,880 --> 04:29:36,000
um

4483
04:29:36,000 --> 04:29:37,360
I believe

4484
04:29:37,360 --> 04:29:40,320
Anything called love just listen to the rhythm of your heart

4485
04:29:40,480 --> 04:29:42,480
Da da da da da da da da da

4486
04:29:49,440 --> 04:29:54,160
Yeah, literally it may be one of those things where I end up actually getting so close that we do just go

4487
04:29:54,240 --> 04:29:56,240
Oh wait, the bank. I can collect money from it

4488
04:29:58,160 --> 04:29:59,760
Eh

4489
04:29:59,760 --> 04:30:02,080
Oh, no, I've already collected my money. Oh, please

4490
04:30:04,000 --> 04:30:06,800
I suppose once we buy the last, um

4491
04:30:06,800 --> 04:30:20,560
how you call them, touristic locations, then we'll shall.

4492
04:30:20,560 --> 04:30:24,000
I'm trying to do the faction challenges, like on the way there.

4493
04:30:24,000 --> 04:30:28,920
Yeah, like I need to hire thieves to lure people away.

4494
04:30:28,920 --> 04:30:33,840
You need to do it 10 times like through their quest then.

4495
04:30:33,840 --> 04:30:35,840
I just need to find enemies

4496
04:30:39,960 --> 04:30:41,960
Yeah, just like that

4497
04:30:44,120 --> 04:30:47,320
We need to complete Christina literally

4498
04:30:48,600 --> 04:30:51,880
Right, what's this? Hi. Are you okay? Oh?

4499
04:30:52,800 --> 04:30:54,800
It's not looking good

4500
04:30:55,480 --> 04:30:57,480
She's beating up

4501
04:30:57,480 --> 04:30:59,480
Don't

4502
04:31:00,840 --> 04:31:03,420
I will not touch you what happened here

4503
04:31:07,480 --> 04:31:11,400
He owns this neighborhood that border I have given it to him

4504
04:31:11,480 --> 04:31:14,160
He once made signs for the shops in the district

4505
04:31:14,520 --> 04:31:19,560
But now he post lies for the border and hurt those who stand in his way. Wow

4506
04:31:21,040 --> 04:31:26,480
Where is he? He spends his days locking his workshop, but I may know how to go them out

4507
04:31:27,480 --> 04:31:33,080
What we're doing kill your target with the hidden blue. I love these missions. What the heck?

4508
04:31:35,840 --> 04:31:39,640
Yesterday said eight hours on the end of being 12 it would have been 14 I

4509
04:31:40,840 --> 04:31:48,080
Don't know maybe one day they'll fix the vod issue if the day comes where they fix that vod issue

4510
04:31:48,640 --> 04:31:55,600
Please let me know because it is over for your sleep schedule. I'm talking we wake up

4511
04:31:55,600 --> 04:32:00,900
We brush our teeth. We get our food and then we stream 14 hours

4512
04:32:10,240 --> 04:32:13,360
Wait, it's the doctor what was to do? Oh, no, it's the same

4513
04:32:15,320 --> 04:32:17,320
Interact oh

4514
04:32:17,880 --> 04:32:20,680
We're pulling down propaganda my apologies. I

4515
04:32:22,040 --> 04:32:24,040
Didn't know

4516
04:32:24,760 --> 04:32:30,760
Can you at least reserve the weekends? Yeah, oh you need a break from my stamina. You're so adorable refling

4517
04:32:31,200 --> 04:32:33,200
There's no breaks on this tree. I

4518
04:32:34,160 --> 04:32:36,160
Was gonna say something else there

4519
04:32:41,240 --> 04:32:44,340
We're pulling down propaganda it's useless posters

4520
04:32:46,480 --> 04:32:49,000
Sleep is already ruined what's a lot more room

4521
04:32:49,920 --> 04:32:51,920
I

4522
04:32:56,000 --> 04:33:02,520
Like I'm trying to do this like obviously they did the poster grab and things

4523
04:33:03,120 --> 04:33:10,640
When you've got no right, but I didn't realize they like we use that actually like the concept because obviously like whenever you think of the

4524
04:33:10,640 --> 04:33:15,680
Past you're like, how did all these people like even get caught for crimes like it just seems so

4525
04:33:15,920 --> 04:33:17,920
Oh

4526
04:33:18,240 --> 04:33:20,240
Kill your target with them

4527
04:33:21,320 --> 04:33:26,800
Can I rip it down or are they gonna be mad at me? Okay, that's exactly odd up smoke bombs

4528
04:33:30,080 --> 04:33:32,080
We're just so that length

4529
04:33:32,200 --> 04:33:34,240
Well, whoa, whoa, I wasn't even yes

4530
04:33:34,240 --> 04:33:39,200
See that's what I get annoyed with if you don't enter combat before they whack you you can't count us

4531
04:33:39,760 --> 04:33:41,840
And I look you can't see one boom, but yeah

4532
04:33:41,840 --> 04:33:48,000
I might be able to get a smoke bomb off of this guy for a little which I would actually really appreciate in case

4533
04:33:49,960 --> 04:33:54,520
Ancient room graffiti you see the walls the Pompey. We're at oh, yes. He does give me a smoke bomb. That was lucky

4534
04:33:55,840 --> 04:33:57,840
I'll definitely try and remember to oh

4535
04:34:05,440 --> 04:34:08,120
So when we pull this down I assume we get to meet the guy

4536
04:34:09,120 --> 04:34:14,440
Oh, we lure him out of his workshop because we've filled all those posters down, okay

4537
04:34:15,800 --> 04:34:17,800
We can definitely do

4538
04:34:20,040 --> 04:34:25,160
Other fan bases be looking at we feel like a man dying of dehydration watching another man drowning

4539
04:34:25,640 --> 04:34:27,960
That's so good. What I

4540
04:34:30,480 --> 04:34:32,480
For goodness sake, I'll get Santa my

4541
04:34:34,760 --> 04:34:36,760
At least he well in this house

4542
04:34:38,240 --> 04:34:42,260
Like I do feel bad when like people have a streamer that maybe like struggles to stream

4543
04:34:43,400 --> 04:34:46,240
And I just find they're like a really good time poke it down

4544
04:34:47,880 --> 04:34:51,200
Is that a multiplayer character it kind of looks like it might actually be

4545
04:34:52,960 --> 04:34:56,400
If it is then that's like another

4546
04:34:57,160 --> 04:35:02,200
Complement to the game would be in like how they incorporated multiplayer characters into the game

4547
04:35:02,840 --> 04:35:04,840
campaign between

4548
04:35:05,840 --> 04:35:07,840
Drowning is standing

4549
04:35:10,360 --> 04:35:12,360
Did you ever play the multiplayer for this game I

4550
04:35:14,080 --> 04:35:16,080
Don't

4551
04:35:17,440 --> 04:35:18,680
I

4552
04:35:18,680 --> 04:35:23,480
Think I was aware of it 56% okay hold on. I'm starting to have hope

4553
04:35:25,280 --> 04:35:28,280
I'm starting to have mild hope. I don't want to get anyone

4554
04:35:29,560 --> 04:35:31,240
I

4555
04:35:31,240 --> 04:35:33,240
Don't want to lead to anyone on

4556
04:35:34,160 --> 04:35:41,000
But it might be possible it might be for the hundred percent run

4557
04:35:43,640 --> 04:35:48,640
Because that's going up way faster now that we're just sorry I should be re-riding horse right now and

4558
04:35:49,960 --> 04:35:55,480
Because that like literally I was so confused why like the percentage was so low okay

4559
04:35:56,480 --> 04:36:04,200
So let's let's see what happens. Let's see. We're at 55 percent. I believe I've gone

4560
04:36:08,200 --> 04:36:11,240
Oh, I remember this one is that stupid

4561
04:36:12,920 --> 04:36:16,640
You go all the way around in order to oh, actually I'm gonna send off assassin recruits

4562
04:36:17,120 --> 04:36:20,640
Need to level them up and we need money money money for tourist attractions

4563
04:36:21,480 --> 04:36:23,480
I

4564
04:36:24,040 --> 04:36:26,040
Know I know

4565
04:36:26,200 --> 04:36:30,120
Knowing that a streamer you like is on most of the days I got time from yours

4566
04:36:30,880 --> 04:36:34,920
Yeah, like I don't really get born out like I'm happy to talk about it, but like I

4567
04:36:36,920 --> 04:36:44,480
Just don't seem to experience like so don't get me wrong. I absolutely can have days where I am

4568
04:36:45,240 --> 04:36:51,280
Like ready to go to bed, but like I wake up on the other side of bed, and I'm like

4569
04:36:52,560 --> 04:36:55,360
What we doing like let's go do this. Let's go do that. Um

4570
04:36:58,240 --> 04:37:00,480
Send them off for 200 type thing

4571
04:37:00,920 --> 04:37:05,840
But like actual burnout like I always wake up the next day like wanting to do something more

4572
04:37:05,840 --> 04:37:08,920
Oh, there's actually a contract right here. We is that inside?

4573
04:37:09,680 --> 04:37:11,680
Oh

4574
04:37:14,560 --> 04:37:20,200
It's fantastic there. Hello, Madame Madonna Madonna

4575
04:37:22,600 --> 04:37:28,320
The pigeons deliver the names of key paper agents the Jubilee has brought the hard part will be the last 5%

4576
04:37:29,520 --> 04:37:31,520
Exchange for up solution

4577
04:37:31,520 --> 04:37:37,160
Threats of damnation terrorized those reluctant to pay the agents collections go directly to Chaldery

4578
04:37:37,360 --> 04:37:39,640
I will make money the least of their worries

4579
04:37:43,600 --> 04:37:45,600
What's the hundred percent

4580
04:37:47,600 --> 04:37:49,600
New assassin contracts a lot

4581
04:37:50,920 --> 04:37:54,680
Say no more my lady. Say no more

4582
04:37:57,440 --> 04:37:58,880
Okay

4583
04:37:58,880 --> 04:38:04,800
Let me get up. Okay. We've got more assassin contract, which means the percentage will get even higher very shortly

4584
04:38:07,760 --> 04:38:09,760
Send away my assassins to level up and

4585
04:38:11,920 --> 04:38:16,080
Well, pardon me, excuse me come through my ladies. Would you like to distract those?

4586
04:38:19,280 --> 04:38:25,600
More ladies would you like to come and distract some

4587
04:38:28,680 --> 04:38:32,800
There's any guards ahead unfortunately, I'm on a horse so much faster than them

4588
04:38:33,440 --> 04:38:37,040
And the horse is stuck on the hill. That's the only thing I don't like with a game

4589
04:38:38,120 --> 04:38:42,360
Right, uh, there's no guard. So we're just gonna we'll be fine. It's okay

4590
04:38:43,680 --> 04:38:48,600
Where's this guy? I'm on the wrong side. Hello. Oh, there you are

4591
04:38:48,600 --> 04:38:50,600
Oh

4592
04:38:59,760 --> 04:39:01,760
What are these contracts doing

4593
04:39:07,040 --> 04:39:11,760
Just one shooter it will be easy to overtake cannot be very accurate

4594
04:39:12,600 --> 04:39:14,600
Oh

4595
04:39:20,160 --> 04:39:22,160
He's swinging a huge person and

4596
04:39:23,520 --> 04:39:26,880
Kill the target using the head and bleed within 45 seconds

4597
04:39:28,160 --> 04:39:30,400
Don't like change both try it

4598
04:39:35,520 --> 04:39:38,920
45 seconds run run run run run run run right he's gonna close that. Okay

4599
04:39:42,360 --> 04:39:44,620
Okay?

4600
04:39:44,620 --> 04:39:46,580
Okay?

4601
04:39:46,580 --> 04:39:48,200
45 seconds hidden bleat.

4602
04:39:48,200 --> 04:39:51,580
45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat.

4603
04:39:51,580 --> 04:39:54,180
45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat,

4604
04:39:54,180 --> 04:39:55,940
45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat,

4605
04:39:55,940 --> 04:40:00,020
45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat,

4606
04:40:00,020 --> 04:40:03,360
hidden bleat, hidden bleat, I love hurting people

4607
04:40:03,360 --> 04:40:05,780
with a hidden bleed, okay we did it.

4608
04:40:05,780 --> 04:40:17,260
Oh. His name is Laquac. Okay, we did it. What's your take on the best AC game regarding

4609
04:40:17,260 --> 04:40:27,580
story-wise? Exio's story-wise? Like, all of Exio? Uh, like, especially Revelations, when...

4610
04:40:27,580 --> 04:40:32,700
Whoa, why am I under attack? What's going on? Give me a run. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where

4611
04:40:32,700 --> 04:40:43,420
did you even come from? I didn't want to hurt anyone, though, as you're doing. I saw that,

4612
04:40:43,420 --> 04:40:47,620
so I'm gonna grab it. I didn't even know where those guys came from. They're no

4613
04:40:47,620 --> 04:40:50,180
stationed here, right?

4614
04:40:50,980 --> 04:40:56,380
Oh. I'm not having a good one around. Hmm.

4615
04:40:58,380 --> 04:41:04,780
You know if we're part of these, Exio's killing a lot of the multiplayer characters. Yes! Definitely.

4616
04:41:04,780 --> 04:41:10,460
We'll go get this assassin contract. Well, can I just spin around the map again, like,

4617
04:41:10,460 --> 04:41:16,180
how we did when we were renovating everything? Spin around the map. Why is he

4618
04:41:16,180 --> 04:41:22,860
whispering in Italian to a French? I don't even know how you'd say rest in peace in

4619
04:41:22,860 --> 04:41:36,100
French. Dormez-vous! Dormez-vous, mate. So, la-vous. C'est n'est pas la vie? No, no, it's not the life

4620
04:41:36,100 --> 04:41:45,260
anymore. My French is awful. I get very confused with how they structure, like, words in French.

4621
04:41:45,300 --> 04:41:50,020
It's true. It's true. Do you ever think about if Exio was really here to be an insane serial

4622
04:41:50,020 --> 04:41:54,020
killer and probably the highest kill- Oh, yeah. Actually, who does have the highest kill count?

4623
04:41:54,020 --> 04:42:08,020
Oh! Don't answer that, actually. Yeah. Not necessary. Thank you, guys. Hmm. I'm gonna grab

4624
04:42:08,020 --> 04:42:14,820
this flag right now. Yeah, no. I, like, I asked the question, and my brain then flashed up

4625
04:42:14,820 --> 04:42:24,820
that answer, and I was like, ah, hmm, hmm. Like, I've run out of this. Uh, nah, we're just meming

4626
04:42:24,820 --> 04:42:30,780
along. We're not really talking about much. I've discovered why my percentage was going up so slow,

4627
04:42:30,780 --> 04:42:37,260
so we're currently in the question mark stage of, is this gonna be a 12-hour marathon to 100%

4628
04:42:37,260 --> 04:42:49,140
the game or not? Because I couldn't figure out why the frickin' game. Oh, we need... Okay, you guys

4629
04:42:49,140 --> 04:42:55,100
are, like, so close to being maxed out. It's crazy. I'm not gonna send you away for 20 minutes, so do

4630
04:42:55,100 --> 04:43:05,780
you max out? Yes, we do. The other two, we don't even need to send away anymore. More. Do you need,

4631
04:43:05,820 --> 04:43:15,220
like, 24 minutes? Nah, you need a bit more XP than that. Got a level 82 XP to it for you. Yeah,

4632
04:43:15,220 --> 04:43:23,340
that looks like quick math. That looks good to me. My brain was still explicit in the context. No, no,

4633
04:43:23,340 --> 04:43:29,460
I don't need it. Oh, I need to accept the contract. Actually, oh, I'm gonna send the thieves on this

4634
04:43:29,540 --> 04:43:39,060
person over here, actually. Actually, factually, as long as you set them on someone, you don't

4635
04:43:39,060 --> 04:43:42,820
actually have to stick around or anything. I'm gonna grab this feather while I'm at it as well,

4636
04:43:42,820 --> 04:43:52,660
because I'm really close to it. Right, as well. It's also a feather in the coliseum that you go

4637
04:43:53,540 --> 04:43:59,860
That's 6 out of 10. Wait, why are you guys still following me? Did you not lure the guards?

4638
04:44:02,980 --> 04:44:05,300
I guess they didn't activate because they weren't close enough.

4639
04:44:10,340 --> 04:44:20,100
Wait, do you only lure away stationery guards? Can he be? Oh, wow, I did not know that. I thought

4640
04:44:20,100 --> 04:44:29,140
you could lure anyone, so I have to pick stationery guards? I have not bought the coliseum. I actually

4641
04:44:29,140 --> 04:44:42,820
might have enough. Right there. Right there, luring him away. I'm gonna go and get this nation. Oh,

4642
04:44:42,820 --> 04:44:49,540
a maestro. I saw that. I saw that. I need five assassins to be maestro, and then we'll do some

4643
04:44:50,100 --> 04:45:00,980
more reblet. You just have to be good at the game. I say you're done. Wait, is this funny? I'm coming for you.

4644
04:45:11,300 --> 04:45:13,700
Right, I'll send them two together, because they're not ready yet.

4645
04:45:14,660 --> 04:45:18,740
Uh, no, I keep forgetting to accept the fricking contract.

4646
04:45:20,580 --> 04:45:26,260
Hi, hi, hi. Yes, yes, yes, but you don't need to tell me. Right, what's the mission assignment?

4647
04:45:26,260 --> 04:45:33,540
Make a nice and easy peasy. Finish the memory within two minutes. Where am I supposed to go?

4648
04:45:33,540 --> 04:45:35,460
Do I need to go by horse or not? Yes or no?

4649
04:45:44,020 --> 04:45:47,300
The thing is, you take, like, if you just directly sprint.

4650
04:45:51,540 --> 04:45:56,180
Yeah, see, this is the problem. All this stuff is in the way in order to get to them in under

4651
04:45:56,180 --> 04:46:07,060
two minutes. Right, gallop, please. Yeah, okay, okay, faster, faster, faster. Yeah, okay, the horse

4652
04:46:07,060 --> 04:46:14,180
was definitely the better bet. You could not run that. And just says do it in under two minutes. So

4653
04:46:15,780 --> 04:46:21,300
yeah, what are you? Oh, they're on horseback. No, that makes fighting so annoying.

4654
04:46:24,340 --> 04:46:28,820
Oh, sorry, I've got an itchy nose, so if my tracking goes away, it's for my 90s.

4655
04:46:30,500 --> 04:46:34,420
Okay, okay, so glad I took the fricking horse. Holy crap.

4656
04:46:38,020 --> 04:46:46,820
Okay, that's it. It's just so easy. It's just so easy. It's so good. Like, I love these

4657
04:46:46,820 --> 04:46:52,900
missions. Holy crap. I had no idea how easy they were. Oh, excellent. And it's like that.

4658
04:46:54,660 --> 04:46:55,860
Literally a minute to spare.

4659
04:47:00,900 --> 04:47:06,660
Another one. Another one. Oh, do you want to come with me? We'll distract some guards.

4660
04:47:07,380 --> 04:47:10,180
I should be so close to doing the distraction on.

4661
04:47:16,740 --> 04:47:22,420
Okay, there's a guard over here. Actually, I need to walk around. I might distract.

4662
04:47:24,900 --> 04:47:31,540
I didn't do anything. May I ask that? Time to perish. Are you ready?

4663
04:47:33,300 --> 04:47:35,060
Oh, is it because I had the weapon out maybe?

4664
04:47:37,780 --> 04:47:43,220
Yeah, I literally did not know.

4665
04:47:49,780 --> 04:47:54,180
So the good thing with the mercenaries, if you walk around with them to the next location,

4666
04:47:54,180 --> 04:47:59,300
you can keep setting them on new people to attack, so I'm just going to bring them with me.

4667
04:47:59,700 --> 04:48:07,140
And once they've attacked 10 people, then we have done that section of the mercenaries challenge.

4668
04:48:10,740 --> 04:48:15,220
Do you think Margaret Thatcher effectively utilised girl power by funneling money into the

4669
04:48:16,180 --> 04:48:30,980
game? I'm just here to play video games. I'm quite happy to admit that this topic of conversation

4670
04:48:30,980 --> 04:48:37,940
is completely out of my knowledge realm. No, I've never played it with monsters. I

4671
04:48:37,940 --> 04:48:42,420
always play vanilla. I prefer to play games vanilla to appreciate the way that the development

4672
04:48:42,420 --> 04:48:48,180
team made it. A lot of people don't like vanilla Skyrim, and I'm so sorry, but I just enjoy it.

4673
04:48:51,300 --> 04:49:00,420
I didn't know because I played on Xbox. I didn't know that on vanilla Skyrim because I was on

4674
04:49:00,420 --> 04:49:06,420
Xbox that the little dots on the floor were daisies and grass until I played on PC for the first time.

4675
04:49:07,380 --> 04:49:14,660
Oh, oh, oh, is it, am I pooping or is that mud?

4676
04:49:16,980 --> 04:49:19,620
Why are they insisting on walking into me, honestly?

4677
04:49:26,100 --> 04:49:31,540
I just tried to watch A.G's stream, A.B's stream, but I'm deaf in my left ear,

4678
04:49:31,540 --> 04:49:35,780
so it went silent for 10 seconds in my right ear. But you heard that? I'm like, I don't know.

4679
04:49:35,780 --> 04:49:39,060
Oh, bless you. What happened?

4680
04:49:42,820 --> 04:49:45,620
Were you born like that or did you get tiniest?

4681
04:49:47,700 --> 04:49:51,460
Are they still not done with that fight? Oh, the guy went back on his horse. I was actually going

4682
04:49:51,460 --> 04:49:58,500
to send him on him. Oh, they're still fighting. Come on. It's just one guy in armor.

4683
04:49:58,820 --> 04:50:05,300
Oh, come on. You can do it. I believe in this.

4684
04:50:07,140 --> 04:50:11,540
Horses kicking. Literally. I've never, I've never had the horse being pushed into the floor.

4685
04:50:12,740 --> 04:50:21,380
Come on, mercenaries. Come on. One of the, yeah, there you go. Geez. Right. We're going to set him

4686
04:50:21,380 --> 04:50:23,380
on this guy now.

4687
04:50:32,340 --> 04:50:36,580
The Guardia. Oh, they're beating that horse up.

4688
04:50:40,900 --> 04:50:45,060
I don't know how many mercenary challenges are completed. All their stuff is like

4689
04:50:45,060 --> 04:50:49,940
weapon based or doing something impressive or winning. We're going to say, do you guys need help?

4690
04:50:52,340 --> 04:50:53,620
I think they need help with him.

4691
04:50:55,620 --> 04:51:01,380
Okay. They definitely need help with him. Yeah, from done. Thanks guys. Glad I hired you.

4692
04:51:10,660 --> 04:51:13,220
Bought some bought things. Taking so long. I know.

4693
04:51:13,220 --> 04:51:23,060
I've almost done like sending the mercenaries on people at least. Is this like five maybe?

4694
04:51:23,860 --> 04:51:29,060
If they could just perish them a bit faster, you know, we can be there.

4695
04:51:32,100 --> 04:51:35,940
Literally, I'm like just hooded man on horse since four men to fight.

4696
04:51:36,500 --> 04:51:43,780
Ten years working around engine rooms. Oh, no. That's like the quickest way to lose here.

4697
04:51:44,500 --> 04:51:46,980
It's like works like that. Okay. Maybe not.

4698
04:51:48,420 --> 04:51:52,500
Why are messages disappeared? Mozio feeling okay? Am I going crazy?

4699
04:51:54,340 --> 04:51:56,340
Rubber room. I'm rubber room through the rest.

4700
04:51:56,340 --> 04:52:06,020
Oh, right. We're almost there. We're almost there.

4701
04:52:11,700 --> 04:52:12,500
Right. Fight him.

4702
04:52:12,980 --> 04:52:22,180
Fill them off the horse or something.

4703
04:52:28,180 --> 04:52:29,940
This is going to take forever.

4704
04:52:34,420 --> 04:52:38,740
Is there like another mercenary group right here? Yeah. Okay. Can I have you?

4705
04:52:39,220 --> 04:52:43,540
And then can I send you to fight this group that's already fighting?

4706
04:52:44,100 --> 04:52:47,300
It works. Okay. Now they're completely outnumbered.

4707
04:52:50,020 --> 04:52:53,060
That must be what? Six now? Only four more to go.

4708
04:52:54,580 --> 04:52:58,020
I'm born deaf on my left ear. Perfect for sleeping because I sleep on Marisa.

4709
04:53:00,660 --> 04:53:07,140
Okay. Now, follow me. So this will be seven?

4710
04:53:08,820 --> 04:53:10,980
Oh, for goodness sake. That's taking forever.

4711
04:53:15,140 --> 04:53:20,820
I'll do that though. Because it's when you send them, they don't have to win the fight.

4712
04:53:20,820 --> 04:53:23,460
It's just when you send them on people. Actually, you know what?

4713
04:53:24,740 --> 04:53:27,380
I'm just checking. I'm just checking. I can't take this anymore.

4714
04:53:29,060 --> 04:53:33,860
Gale challenges. Mercenary? Nine? Okay.

4715
04:53:34,500 --> 04:53:42,020
Guards killed Will on horseback. Brutes killed. Scaffolding.

4716
04:53:44,020 --> 04:53:49,460
Guards on horseback. Ares assassinated? That must be done from a certain location.

4717
04:53:49,460 --> 04:53:53,300
Yeah, double assassinations. Three out of ten. I can hardly get it done.

4718
04:53:54,340 --> 04:53:59,860
Court is on. Nine. Oh, guard's poisoned. It's 15, so I do need to go poison a ton more guards.

4719
04:54:00,420 --> 04:54:04,580
I assume if they hate each other, then I don't care. Okay, thieves on our entrance.

4720
04:54:05,300 --> 04:54:11,460
Leaves of faith, I need a 20. Guards are assassinated from a mini.

4721
04:54:18,100 --> 04:54:28,580
I just need to find one enemy. Hello, you are enemy. And fight. Okay, finally. That took so long.

4722
04:54:30,260 --> 04:54:34,900
Hiring discount earned a little bit. Hello.

4723
04:54:49,540 --> 04:54:54,340
Man, look at his fresh cut on that beard. Look at that angle. Is that even possible back then?

4724
04:54:54,580 --> 04:55:02,180
I was really dumb, but like before razors were invented,

4725
04:55:02,820 --> 04:55:07,620
did guys just like shave their beard on rocks and stuff? Like, I know that sounds really silly,

4726
04:55:07,620 --> 04:55:12,100
but did they like fashion a rock to be sharp? And then that's how you got rid of your beard?

4727
04:55:12,100 --> 04:55:14,980
Or did like everyone just have beards back in the old days?

4728
04:55:15,940 --> 04:55:17,540
The razors weren't a thing.

4729
04:55:19,060 --> 04:55:26,500
Maybe glass. It was 100%. Kill by air assassination.

4730
04:55:30,420 --> 04:55:33,940
Sheave with swords. Not like before that kind of thing.

4731
04:55:38,900 --> 04:55:42,420
Oh, wow, it's such a good far way. Maybe a horse again.

4732
04:55:45,620 --> 04:55:53,140
I'm tired of thieves. They may be able to keep up. I'm fucking do a lure away the guards.

4733
04:55:53,860 --> 04:55:57,380
Thank you. We're getting there. We're getting there. We're getting there.

4734
04:56:04,340 --> 04:56:10,740
I'm getting stuck on a rope. They shave with knives. They just go to homies to scratch their

4735
04:56:10,740 --> 04:56:18,260
beards off by hand. That sounds painful as anything. Shave with obsidian.

4736
04:56:20,420 --> 04:56:21,060
Guys still did.

4737
04:56:23,380 --> 04:56:28,020
Okay, what am I supposed to do here? Oh, air assassination. Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb

4738
04:56:28,020 --> 04:56:31,140
and see the guys probably up in this building then since it's all red.

4739
04:56:31,140 --> 04:56:39,060
Hmm. I'm not gonna be discovered, am I? Hello. Goodbye.

4740
04:56:40,500 --> 04:56:44,660
Actually, I need to start looting bodies because I'm getting low on supplies,

4741
04:56:44,660 --> 04:56:46,340
because I'm wasting them all.

4742
04:56:46,580 --> 04:56:57,700
Okay, air assassination.

4743
04:56:59,940 --> 04:57:04,820
Let's give it a shot. Where is he? Gee, I wonder where it's air assassination.

4744
04:57:04,820 --> 04:57:06,420
Oh, I just called him a horse doing that.

4745
04:57:11,220 --> 04:57:13,540
I need to get away. That's why I called him a horse.

4746
04:57:13,540 --> 04:57:21,460
Gee. I haven't drawn his mug on two monitors as overwhelming.

4747
04:57:21,460 --> 04:57:26,100
Wait until I make hypnosis. I'm so excited to make my first one. I don't know what to do.

4748
04:57:27,940 --> 04:57:32,180
I was gonna do a like free thing.

4749
04:57:34,180 --> 04:57:37,860
God, these missions are so good and easy. I can't get over it.

4750
04:57:38,820 --> 04:57:42,180
I'm not doing the Naruto. I'll keep doing the Templar Agents

4751
04:57:43,620 --> 04:57:45,780
because it's starting to get like less and less.

4752
04:57:46,340 --> 04:57:52,340
Copernico is a nightmare. If I remember correctly, Copernico is like throw yourself

4753
04:57:52,340 --> 04:57:57,300
across the city as fast as you can type missions, which I despise.

4754
04:57:57,300 --> 04:58:00,340
And like it really does not give you like much time at all.

4755
04:58:00,340 --> 04:58:02,740
So I'm not looking forward to doing Copernico.

4756
04:58:03,940 --> 04:58:06,180
No, I don't need the body, but thank you.

4757
04:58:07,140 --> 04:58:10,260
Hello, horsey. Are you ready?

4758
04:58:11,140 --> 04:58:18,340
Mount. Mabos. Mabos. Well, the horse, please think of Mabos.

4759
04:58:25,300 --> 04:58:28,180
Speaking of, are you going to collab with Secret Subject?

4760
04:58:28,180 --> 04:58:31,620
I haven't reached out yet. I know Secret is like super busy.

4761
04:58:32,260 --> 04:58:37,060
Like she's got like the new VTuber model and everything going on.

4762
04:58:37,700 --> 04:58:43,220
And I don't want to be like a bother, like harassing anyone.

4763
04:58:46,900 --> 04:58:51,220
I might get the boss to reach out, but at the moment, like I've actually got quite a lot of

4764
04:58:51,220 --> 04:58:58,420
people that are interested in collabs with me. And I'm going to try and like not take too much

4765
04:58:58,500 --> 04:59:04,420
time. Like I say, she says that she plays on stream for 12 hours and literally has like folk

4766
04:59:04,420 --> 04:59:08,660
waiting on her right in the script. So it can be sent off. Well, that was.

4767
04:59:12,100 --> 04:59:18,260
But I don't want to send you away. Can I send?

4768
04:59:20,660 --> 04:59:23,220
I'm so sorry. I think I need a drawing.

4769
04:59:23,220 --> 04:59:28,740
I think it's time. The problem

4770
04:59:32,180 --> 04:59:37,380
is that I take like five minutes to generate one. I really don't want to go.

4771
04:59:40,260 --> 04:59:47,460
I know it didn't happen yesterday, which I'm really happy about, but I think it's happening.

4772
04:59:47,460 --> 04:59:53,380
Oh, wait. Sorry. Oh, sorry. I need to go into an emergency meeting with one of the girls over

4773
04:59:53,380 --> 05:00:01,860
something. But I'm like 90% sure I can feel my organs shifting around.

4774
05:00:03,940 --> 05:00:11,300
I have no coin on my corpse. I can hear them behind me. That's actually pretty scary. No.

4775
05:00:12,180 --> 05:00:19,540
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, doing this, I will take advantage of the smoke because we need to kill

4776
05:00:19,540 --> 05:00:23,140
enemies in smoke.

4777
05:00:32,260 --> 05:00:37,060
Right, they can all just fight each other. Oh, I need to go through the most.

4778
05:00:37,220 --> 05:00:41,540
Any idea when the first hit in the stream, I'll do my job.

4779
05:00:44,420 --> 05:00:50,660
It's time is my biggest problem. Like if we end up doing that 100%, I don't know if it's possible.

4780
05:00:52,020 --> 05:00:58,340
Then I probably won't do it tonight. Needy streamer. I need to go out and buy American

4781
05:00:58,340 --> 05:01:02,900
sweets for this hand cam stream and clean up my desk because it's an absolute mess.

4782
05:01:03,380 --> 05:01:06,820
And get like a nice cute outfit and all that.

4783
05:01:09,380 --> 05:01:16,020
It's just time, honestly. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm not interested in making it. It's just

4784
05:01:16,020 --> 05:01:20,420
time. I've got these Ace Mark gloves and girls are waiting on me. And then I'm sending away

4785
05:01:20,420 --> 05:01:25,060
shorts of the girls to be made to Clippers because I didn't want them being stressed out,

4786
05:01:25,060 --> 05:01:34,260
having to organize this stuff. I guess it's just trying to settle in right now,

4787
05:01:35,140 --> 05:01:42,180
but I hope to have some consistent stuff. That's free to access. I do want at least

4788
05:01:42,180 --> 05:01:49,300
something decent free to access on the alt because I don't think it's fair, especially for

4789
05:01:50,420 --> 05:01:54,980
people that just simply don't have the money. I completely understand. Don't ever feel bad

4790
05:01:54,980 --> 05:01:59,060
if you're unable to just straight up give money to streamers or anything like that.

4791
05:01:59,060 --> 05:02:06,100
Like any of the viewers. I am 100% can say right now that all the girls feel the exact

4792
05:02:06,100 --> 05:02:11,060
same way as me. If you can't afford it, please don't feel bad. Literally watching,

4793
05:02:11,060 --> 05:02:16,500
liking, commenting, flipping if you want, liking a tweet. All of this stuff is free to do.

4794
05:02:17,140 --> 05:02:26,020
Like that helps us beyond words. So don't ever feel inclined and like thank you for

4795
05:02:26,020 --> 05:02:30,580
respecting that there like is a paywall and some of the content because obviously the girls need

4796
05:02:30,580 --> 05:02:37,220
to eat and they need to thrive because if they don't like thrive monetary wise, then obviously

4797
05:02:37,220 --> 05:02:43,300
they're not going to stick around a veiler. Why would you? So like I do appreciate everyone's

4798
05:02:43,300 --> 05:02:51,140
like complete understanding around it. Um right, where's the source? I am actually

4799
05:02:51,140 --> 05:03:02,900
unironically stuck. Where the heck am I going? Over the bridge? Over the bridge? Over the broken

4800
05:03:02,900 --> 05:03:11,540
breed? The girls are doing great. Don't worry. No, not over the broken bridge. Don't be fooled by

4801
05:03:11,540 --> 05:03:18,660
the map. It's not that old. How do I get down though? I always have that problem whenever I come

4802
05:03:18,660 --> 05:03:27,060
up to this section. You have to like all of your breath around. We're already lucky and spoiled

4803
05:03:27,060 --> 05:03:32,180
with what you've done for us already. No need to rush, yeah. Like I know some folk are noticing

4804
05:03:32,180 --> 05:03:39,940
like oh all the girls aren't posting anymore and it was like yeah the girls are live streaming now

4805
05:03:39,940 --> 05:03:45,620
they're preparing for streams. They're thinking ahead like they got stuff to do now. Before the

4806
05:03:45,620 --> 05:03:52,820
only stuff the girls could do was meme in the discord with each other and muck about on twitter

4807
05:03:52,820 --> 05:03:59,540
and pre-record audios you know and now they've got so much to deal with and contend with so yeah.

4808
05:04:01,780 --> 05:04:07,540
What am I doing? What am I doing before I mess up? Kill your target? Why is this game so good?

4809
05:04:08,260 --> 05:04:14,740
These game missions are so good. It's actually making me angry. I have nice

4810
05:04:14,740 --> 05:04:21,700
interfaces. No, I do understand that some people like complain to complain. That's okay. That's

4811
05:04:21,700 --> 05:04:27,140
just how some people are. Like it's how they like get you know like stressed out. It's therapeutic

4812
05:04:27,140 --> 05:04:39,940
to kind of have a mooper whatever. It's a lady killer. Okay I need to chase. Stop chasing me.

4813
05:04:40,660 --> 05:04:48,660
No you like it you little rascal. You're teasing me. You're a leaky. I don't know what that means.

4814
05:04:48,660 --> 05:04:57,780
They didn't put the subtitles in. Stop it. I love a good glitch. I love a good glitch.

4815
05:04:57,780 --> 05:05:06,900
I love a good glitch and that helps me get the objective. I love that. That was good. Just do

4816
05:05:06,900 --> 05:05:16,820
that again. Honestly renaissance outfit starting to grow in me. It's kind of renaissance influence

4817
05:05:16,820 --> 05:05:31,140
outfit maybe. Someone suggested a design which was uh was it an aristocrat? Vampire?

4818
05:05:32,900 --> 05:05:42,340
No it was a smug aristocrat. I'm very like posh hoity toyy looking. The only problem is they

4819
05:05:42,340 --> 05:05:47,700
would have to be brish because if there were any other I was about to say if there were any other

4820
05:05:47,700 --> 05:05:54,100
gender it doesn't work. If there were no brish I was like oh Christina available. Wait what's her DNA

4821
05:05:54,100 --> 05:06:07,060
if Christina is available? I'm not questioning it. To Christina we go. Any other gender than

4822
05:06:07,060 --> 05:06:14,180
brish? Well that child was like okay thanks brain. Strony. Yesterday don't follow lady who

4823
05:06:14,180 --> 05:06:20,980
and also me. No no no no I like that. It's a lady assassin though. Only I am allowed to

4824
05:06:20,980 --> 05:06:28,900
raise lady assassins. Okay I'm coming Christina because I have no idea what the heck that you're

4825
05:06:28,900 --> 05:06:35,620
freaking storyline is. All right I need you guys because you guys I need to lure away guards with

4826
05:06:38,660 --> 05:06:45,060
can I technically get you guys to- well why am I- right I guess not. There should be some guards

4827
05:06:45,060 --> 05:06:49,780
coming up. Good they can run fast they're keeping up with a horse practical.

4828
05:06:49,780 --> 05:06:53,460
Thank you.

4829
05:06:53,460 --> 05:06:57,780
Lure them away.

4830
05:06:57,780 --> 05:07:03,460
Aristocrat with a Jordy axe.

4831
05:07:03,460 --> 05:07:09,940
Wait how is this all spun about when it comes to the section of the map it's terrible.

4832
05:07:12,900 --> 05:07:14,820
I think it's on the side.

4833
05:07:14,900 --> 05:07:18,820
Stuck their anger.

4834
05:07:30,820 --> 05:07:34,820
Goodness me. I just can't even get this right.

4835
05:07:34,820 --> 05:07:36,820
I cannot have gone there on you.

4836
05:07:36,820 --> 05:07:42,820
From the rang way? You rang? You're the one that's now- oh excuse me you're in my way.

4837
05:07:42,820 --> 05:07:46,340
I could have sworn there's a cape that makes guards ignore you unless you like

4838
05:07:46,340 --> 05:07:50,660
straight up attack them. I need to put them to that. I don't know what cape that is.

4839
05:07:56,020 --> 05:07:58,820
Oh wow I think that's five one two.

4840
05:08:06,980 --> 05:08:11,460
I'm just gonna send them away for money because I think we actually might have enough now.

4841
05:08:13,460 --> 05:08:19,700
For- for what? For buying everything yet.

4842
05:08:21,540 --> 05:08:29,060
Right Christina my love thank you for unlocking because we were genuinely also confused on what

4843
05:08:29,060 --> 05:08:37,220
a bizarre ending your storyline had because that didn't make any sense and you know it didn't so what

4844
05:08:37,220 --> 05:08:42,660
on earth are we busy? Oh no.

4845
05:08:47,220 --> 05:08:49,220
Oh no I think we're going to the fair.

4846
05:08:52,900 --> 05:08:58,980
Do you get an EC mod for your pretty extreme? Maybe put like an assassin screen hood on me.

4847
05:08:59,380 --> 05:09:06,820
So there's gonna be an assassin screen. I've never thought about that. Maybe I should get

4848
05:09:06,820 --> 05:09:13,300
Ezio's outfit and like- but like you know get the- get like red lacy underwear and stuff.

4849
05:09:17,540 --> 05:09:19,540
Leonardo.

4850
05:09:29,540 --> 05:09:34,580
Perhaps it would have been better not to tell you. She's with her husband. She may not be too happy to see you.

4851
05:09:35,380 --> 05:09:41,540
No it's wonderful. It's carnival. With these masks she will not even know it's me.

4852
05:09:42,180 --> 05:09:44,740
I know just the way to draw her attention.

4853
05:09:45,060 --> 05:09:51,540
Oh he's not over her. He's heartbroken.

4854
05:09:54,500 --> 05:09:55,540
That's so sad.

4855
05:09:58,260 --> 05:10:05,540
I can't remember what we have to do here though. Oh there she is. I'm to tail her.

4856
05:10:05,940 --> 05:10:14,820
There she is with her other hussies.

4857
05:10:23,940 --> 05:10:25,780
I'm just so interested in these masks.

4858
05:10:28,260 --> 05:10:32,180
She just got to circle? Wait what was it? Am I supposed to do something?

4859
05:10:32,180 --> 05:10:39,860
Oh plan a letter on her. I beg your pardon. I was like why did she just go on a circle?

4860
05:10:46,180 --> 05:10:50,500
Okay that makes much more sense. Way more sense.

4861
05:10:53,940 --> 05:10:58,100
Okay the rendezvous. Don't mind me.

4862
05:11:03,060 --> 05:11:04,420
Wait she reciprocates.

4863
05:11:04,420 --> 05:11:06,420
Um

4864
05:11:18,500 --> 05:11:22,420
It's you that's wrong. This is it's you.

4865
05:11:22,420 --> 05:11:24,420
Oh

4866
05:11:40,500 --> 05:11:44,420
It's been eight years? I was afraid you wouldn't come if I just asked.

4867
05:11:53,300 --> 05:11:58,900
It was the right thing to do. We loved you. Who cares what he wanted? I love you.

4868
05:12:01,700 --> 05:12:05,620
You had your second child. Please that's it.

4869
05:12:06,900 --> 05:12:15,060
It got worse. Why did we do this? Why did we play that memory? It got worse. Is that where it ends?

4870
05:12:15,620 --> 05:12:23,460
That was even worse. Why did we go away? Why did we go further? There has to be another one. There's

4871
05:12:23,460 --> 05:12:33,060
no way. It got so much worse. That was terrible.

4872
05:12:33,700 --> 05:12:35,700
Oh

4873
05:12:42,660 --> 05:12:49,620
Shot through the heart. True. That got even. I don't know why. Like I don't know why I thought

4874
05:12:49,620 --> 05:12:54,580
that memory would like oh that's gonna be so much better than the last one. No.

4875
05:12:56,820 --> 05:13:00,020
No no no no no. That's terrible.

4876
05:13:00,420 --> 05:13:09,300
Well she said don't find her again but I'm left unsatisfied. I feel like that's such a short

4877
05:13:09,300 --> 05:13:16,820
memory that's not like the true ending. Right we're gonna upgrade our assassins just because

4878
05:13:20,420 --> 05:13:29,140
we have the thing. I'm not bothered about the thieves honestly. I have quite a lot of money though.

4879
05:13:30,340 --> 05:13:36,740
Good on Christina for not being a cheater. Literally like when

4880
05:13:38,500 --> 05:13:43,940
when she was like oh husband's name. I was like wait Etsy planted the lair and like

4881
05:13:45,940 --> 05:13:50,980
ah what a mess Etsy. What a mess you've got yourself into in a pickle.

4882
05:13:53,220 --> 05:13:56,180
Yeah he sucks when it comes to romance. Like everything is permitted.

4883
05:14:00,900 --> 05:14:02,900
Goodness gravy.

4884
05:14:17,380 --> 05:14:21,380
Welcome to the Brotherhood. Yes.

4885
05:14:25,620 --> 05:14:26,740
Did I get the thing?

4886
05:14:30,020 --> 05:14:36,340
Hmm. Suspend points.

4887
05:14:39,300 --> 05:14:41,300
Assassins Guild challenges complete. Okay.

4888
05:14:44,020 --> 05:14:48,820
Uh oh Guild crest stop. Is there something new around here?

4889
05:14:49,220 --> 05:15:00,420
This? We get little things. We get trinkets. Oh my god this game. I'm sorry this game was

4890
05:15:00,420 --> 05:15:05,780
made for girls. You're telling me. I get a little sim and I get to put it in my little house. My

4891
05:15:05,780 --> 05:15:13,380
little assassin house. Okay sorry I love this game so much. How did it know? How did it know I was a

4892
05:15:13,380 --> 05:15:17,620
girl? Good night. Rest well. See you in the morning.

4893
05:15:21,140 --> 05:15:23,540
Gender norms go hands my goodness.

4894
05:15:25,220 --> 05:15:29,860
Ah right I don't really want to start Copernicus. We'll go buy the Pantheon.

4895
05:15:34,900 --> 05:15:39,140
We'll go buy this because we literally do have a I'll check the bank in case any interest is made.

4896
05:15:40,020 --> 05:15:47,860
Accessories clear. I can't believe it. I can't believe I get to decorate those assassins freaking

4897
05:15:47,860 --> 05:15:56,420
hideout with my guild crests for all my hard work. Ah. We know the target audience. Honestly

4898
05:15:57,060 --> 05:16:03,140
is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a girls game? The only reason I say that is because it's like

4899
05:16:03,140 --> 05:16:11,140
such a good game. Like it doesn't it's like so hard to get like genuinely to get stuck in like

4900
05:16:11,140 --> 05:16:18,740
at any part is next to impossible. Oh I need poison guards actually.

4901
05:16:21,380 --> 05:16:26,580
I'm just gonna like muck about and I don't want to poison like anyone in front but I think they

4902
05:16:26,580 --> 05:16:30,820
need to like pass away from poison or it doesn't count because I'm pretty sure of poison quite a

4903
05:16:30,900 --> 05:16:42,020
lot now. Game's so good it breaks the gender barrier. Why is this one so goofy looking honestly?

4904
05:16:46,740 --> 05:16:52,180
Wait are you saying if it's easy to make friends? I mean I don't know. I feel like whenever I see

4905
05:16:52,180 --> 05:16:59,220
like a guy review a game it's always like I love the challenge of this game. I love having to repeat

4906
05:16:59,220 --> 05:17:07,460
the same thing like 12 times over until I got like unspanked and like I figured it out and I'm

4907
05:17:07,460 --> 05:17:12,660
like I just want to chill experience like make it through the story mode and have a good time

4908
05:17:14,020 --> 05:17:19,300
and like yeah I'm just a bad gamer that wants indie games.

4909
05:17:22,900 --> 05:17:26,820
Not a free game journal. I feel like Brotherhood is such a great game that boys angry.

4910
05:17:30,180 --> 05:17:33,220
My little cousin played it after watching me play it so there it is.

4911
05:17:39,540 --> 05:17:44,500
Then you gotta love Dark Souls. I mean it's basically what you- no Dark Souls is the opposite

4912
05:17:44,500 --> 05:17:52,020
of what I described and I know for a factoid it is because I have had the pleasure of playing

4913
05:17:52,020 --> 05:17:57,300
Elden Ring with the Reeflings and the truth you want the truth I don't think you can handle the

4914
05:17:57,300 --> 05:18:04,020
truth. I would not have been able to complete that game on my own like I just don't see how

4915
05:18:04,020 --> 05:18:10,900
I could have done it without all the help of the Reeflings. That's the truth you think you can handle

4916
05:18:10,900 --> 05:18:26,180
the truth. I'll just poison them one at a time. I think I need to wait until they expire as well

4917
05:18:26,180 --> 05:18:33,060
which is the biggest problem. You're just like your hand being held didn't you? What do you mean

4918
05:18:33,060 --> 05:18:37,860
that like all these people are being so nice to me and helping me through my game and I get to

4919
05:18:37,860 --> 05:18:44,100
reward them? Maybe I should do that like every time we do like a game where you guys hold my

4920
05:18:44,100 --> 05:18:49,860
hands like I do a reward audio for it and then like my set like when I'm you know doing the

4921
05:18:49,860 --> 05:18:54,660
ending part of the reward I'm like thank you for helping me thank you for helping me thank you

4922
05:18:54,660 --> 05:19:01,220
for over me and then then I pop. You know that's terrible I know.

4923
05:19:06,020 --> 05:19:07,540
Can you poison on horseback?

4924
05:19:12,100 --> 05:19:16,020
It says shoot. No you can't poison on horseback.

4925
05:19:24,820 --> 05:19:30,020
Spank in that horse jeez. I'm not gonna hang around until I need him to expire.

4926
05:19:34,900 --> 05:19:41,620
I wouldn't be opposed. Wait we played what? Uh Elden Ring. Elden Ring's a really good game to

4927
05:19:41,620 --> 05:19:54,180
carry. I think I want to carry you. It's a beautiful stream and strong ease so dumb to play.

4928
05:19:56,100 --> 05:19:58,980
Hey streamer I think I want to carry you.

4929
05:19:59,300 --> 05:20:13,460
They're all looking in opposite directions so I can maybe do two.

4930
05:20:16,500 --> 05:20:20,340
I can maybe do three if I get this guy. Oh no I can't they're both.

4931
05:20:21,140 --> 05:20:25,620
He does his hands. They'd be amazing.

4932
05:20:27,380 --> 05:20:32,100
Games should have some challenge though. Yeah no I do agree there definitely should be like

4933
05:20:32,100 --> 05:20:36,100
some consequence or else if you don't feel like any pressure to do anything then you

4934
05:20:36,100 --> 05:20:41,220
don't enjoy the game like it's really hard to nail what kind of dynamic that you wanted.

4935
05:20:42,340 --> 05:20:48,660
Like oh I'm in trouble I'm sorry. I am a naughty assassin. I didn't hate well enough.

4936
05:20:49,380 --> 05:20:54,660
Unless don't don't don't. Oh don't push me. Get poisoned.

4937
05:20:56,660 --> 05:20:59,380
Plap plap plap. Get poison get poison poison.

4938
05:21:02,260 --> 05:21:08,820
Everyone's getting poisoned around here. Oh please spin that pole around. There we go.

4939
05:21:08,820 --> 05:21:13,940
Okay I managed to replenish a ton of poisons which is good because oh hello.

4940
05:21:14,660 --> 05:21:19,060
You're going in the well for thieving from me. Goodbye.

4941
05:21:22,740 --> 05:21:31,300
Um you can come out now. It's okay I'll come get you. I did not mean to do that. I don't think

4942
05:21:31,300 --> 05:21:37,140
his life should have been forfeit but I mean was it kind of deserved? I don't know.

4943
05:21:37,540 --> 05:21:43,460
Everything that was a bit morbid I'd say I'm gonna be honest I actually didn't expect that.

4944
05:21:45,060 --> 05:21:49,460
Please mummy don't poison my iron brew. Have a can iron brew in the fridge.

4945
05:21:52,660 --> 05:21:58,660
Right it ages ago and I'm still not sipped up. I need like the perfect meal. I miss

4946
05:21:58,660 --> 05:22:07,460
British fish and chips so much. I'm sorry to any Aussies listening. Your fish and chips are rank.

4947
05:22:14,820 --> 05:22:17,460
Okay I did the courtesan. Can I poison?

4948
05:22:18,020 --> 05:22:29,620
Can I like poison all you guys and then push it all away so you don't do that fighting thing?

4949
05:22:30,660 --> 05:22:34,900
I hate when they do the fighting thing. I think if they like hit each other with

4950
05:22:34,900 --> 05:22:39,460
the swords it doesn't count as poison so I'm gonna try and separate them. Oh he just did it there.

4951
05:22:39,460 --> 05:22:49,220
No I tried. I don't want to leave the vicinity too quickly for the poison but something.

4952
05:22:50,900 --> 05:22:56,820
Hey I'm not gonna find it with fish and chips around here. Yeah Aussies use shark and like I think

4953
05:22:56,820 --> 05:23:02,340
it's called gummy shark. It's not actual shark meat it's just a fish.

4954
05:23:03,300 --> 05:23:14,500
How do you call Germans Scottish? Oh there we go we did the poison gourd. Rank five courtesan.

4955
05:23:16,820 --> 05:23:29,860
Did I say courtesans poison people now? Ladies. Am I in Australia forever? I highly doubt it.

4956
05:23:29,860 --> 05:23:38,020
It's very good to run a business from Australia compared to the United Kingdom but oh no you're

4957
05:23:38,020 --> 05:23:47,460
saying get down to me but not to this wife over here. What's he gonna say? No are you doing me?

4958
05:23:48,340 --> 05:23:53,780
Um yeah it's good to run a business in Australia but I can't see myself being here forever.

4959
05:23:53,780 --> 05:24:00,660
I've fallen from my share of rooftops. I'm waiting for my lance. Up here. He left me after our baby died.

4960
05:24:01,700 --> 05:24:07,460
Joined up with the Chento of Keegan. They say he kills now pushes men from buildings.

4961
05:24:08,500 --> 05:24:14,100
I tell them I don't believe it. The British use haddock is a delicious fish. What will you say when he comes?

4962
05:24:14,100 --> 05:24:20,580
Are you in Australia? Heck yeah I am. I'm doing uh I'm making a call. My death will remind him of the

4963
05:24:20,580 --> 05:24:25,940
man he once was. I'm gonna do a VTuber meet and greet in Australia.

4964
05:24:28,580 --> 05:24:31,460
I did not look at what the hundred percent thing was. Oopsie.

4965
05:24:33,140 --> 05:24:41,060
Hold her head a guy. You will travel you no more Madonna. Madonna. What's hundred percent?

4966
05:24:41,060 --> 05:24:48,740
Kill your target with a hidden blade. Why is this mission type so so perfect?

4967
05:24:54,500 --> 05:25:01,380
So Imburgh was well with fish and chips then. Kind of. I don't know what the best takeaway,

4968
05:25:01,380 --> 05:25:08,580
maybe unironically a Chinese but like a British Chinese. Oh I think I need to chase this guy

4969
05:25:08,820 --> 05:25:13,700
from the rooftops. I think yeah. It's giving chase from the rooftops.

4970
05:25:17,780 --> 05:25:23,780
What do you mean merda? Get bonked. Hidden blade hidden blade. Lock on to him at least.

4971
05:25:23,780 --> 05:25:28,740
Exhale don't be afraid. Exhale water. Exhale.

4972
05:25:31,380 --> 05:25:38,260
The only thing I despise is when you have to do like assassin. Can you come here? Yeah? Yeah?

4973
05:25:38,260 --> 05:25:43,300
Yeah? No. No. No. Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back. Can I knock him off?

4974
05:25:44,500 --> 05:25:49,700
Why are you trying to hit the ear? You know full well what I'm aiming for it. So like genuinely.

4975
05:25:51,540 --> 05:25:58,900
Oh goodness sake. Stop moving a bit. Just accept your death. It's over for you buddy.

4976
05:26:00,260 --> 05:26:05,300
Stop it. I'm actually getting teased. Stop it. There we go. My goodness.

4977
05:26:08,340 --> 05:26:14,180
My tummy hurt. No more food. No more have you eaten too much. Can't forget.

4978
05:26:16,980 --> 05:26:25,620
Have you had any encounter with the local fauna? Ah magpies. I have befriended wild magpies. Although

4979
05:26:25,620 --> 05:26:33,700
I saw my first snake in a cockroach. Oh my god. There's no such thing as cockroaches

4980
05:26:33,940 --> 05:26:42,420
in Scotland. And I met my first and a possum. Oh my god. Possum are terrifying. I don't like.

4981
05:26:42,420 --> 05:26:46,660
I thought they were cute. The noise they make at night is like

4982
05:26:50,260 --> 05:26:58,900
a very scary. Not a fan. Not a fan. Yeah. I had my first cockroach encounter and I'm like I want

4983
05:26:58,900 --> 05:27:07,780
to go back to Scotland right now. Thank you very much. Because oh my goodness. Possums

4984
05:27:07,780 --> 05:27:16,260
are harmless if you leave them alone. Yes. I accidentally ran like into one. That sounds

4985
05:27:16,260 --> 05:27:24,420
really dumb. But my cat escaped the garden and I had to go into my neighbour's garden.

4986
05:27:24,420 --> 05:27:30,740
And it was one o'clock in the morning and thank goodness I'm no in America because I probably

4987
05:27:30,740 --> 05:27:39,060
would have got shot on sight. Oh I'm in trouble. And it was absolute nightmare. It was freaking

4988
05:27:40,020 --> 05:27:45,780
so dark and I had to run around to get into my neighbour's garden and there was a possum that

4989
05:27:45,780 --> 05:27:51,140
was eye level on the fence. And both of us basically like both me and the possum were like

4990
05:27:56,420 --> 05:28:04,500
but yeah I had to dive into my neighbour's garden. I'm wondering to throw my cat back over the fence.

4991
05:28:05,860 --> 05:28:14,020
Yes Gimli. I'm talking about you. Don't do it again. I never want to be in that situation again.

4992
05:28:14,020 --> 05:28:19,300
I had to stick a letter through the freaking mailbox being like I am so sorry if you heard any

4993
05:28:19,300 --> 05:28:25,620
of that. Ruckus last night. That was me. No one tried to steal from you. And like I had to sign it

4994
05:28:25,620 --> 05:28:33,060
with my freaking address and everything. Her name is Gimli. Yes. Because she's Ginger.

4995
05:28:34,580 --> 05:28:41,780
She's got ginger on her so I named my cat Gimli. So when I pick her up I go that's my wee laugh.

4996
05:28:42,180 --> 05:28:44,180
Gimli.

4997
05:28:48,340 --> 05:28:53,940
Excuse me. You said well the thing what it was literally 1am and like they're creak they had the

4998
05:28:53,940 --> 05:29:01,300
creakiest gate ever and I'm like I'm like Gimli. Gimli get here. Gimli get here right now. Gimli.

4999
05:29:01,300 --> 05:29:09,860
And because she had never been outside the garden before and she got really confused and was meowing

5000
05:29:09,860 --> 05:29:15,860
at the door of the neighbor instead of coming back over the fence to me like I had been calling on

5001
05:29:15,860 --> 05:29:20,260
her for ages and I was trying not to wake up any of the neighborhoods like the neighborhood area.

5002
05:29:20,980 --> 05:29:22,660
Donut was the man that I met him a long time ago.

5003
05:29:22,660 --> 05:29:26,260
I was like Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli.

5004
05:29:27,140 --> 05:29:32,260
Kill only Donut though. Big Donut. Where can I find you?

5005
05:29:33,220 --> 05:29:38,100
Thank you. Nobody. No, like unironically I had to toss Gimli back in the garden.

5006
05:29:38,980 --> 05:29:46,740
And yeah she's not here and the music's gonna do the thing.

5007
05:29:49,220 --> 05:29:50,820
I love the pickup of the music.

5008
05:29:57,940 --> 05:30:04,980
Oh my god veterinary care though in Australia is so fairly priced and so good.

5009
05:30:08,180 --> 05:30:17,220
My baby boy he ended up injuring himself on something mysterious and he had a cut on his leg

5010
05:30:18,740 --> 05:30:24,020
and I phoned up a vet and they were like oh we offer up a pickup service

5011
05:30:25,540 --> 05:30:29,300
for animals and I'm like well I don't drive so that's perfect thank you.

5012
05:30:30,260 --> 05:30:32,980
I don't understand how you can do that though.

5013
05:30:33,700 --> 05:30:35,700
Wait I need to kill all my him.

5014
05:30:37,220 --> 05:30:37,700
Simple.

5015
05:30:40,020 --> 05:30:41,300
You can bowl a cat.

5016
05:30:41,300 --> 05:30:44,820
What? Where are my field workers at?

5017
05:30:48,260 --> 05:30:54,180
But yeah they phoned up I'm like my baby boy's got a cut on his leg I don't know what happened.

5018
05:30:56,820 --> 05:31:00,740
Can I book an appointment? I was gonna have to put him in a taxi with me.

5019
05:31:01,460 --> 05:31:03,540
Wait wait wait just becoming almost.

5020
05:31:03,540 --> 05:31:04,260

Uh right.

05:31:57,380 --> 05:32:00,180
Which path does indices not normally take?

5059
05:32:00,180 --> 05:32:01,220
Like this one I guess.

5060
05:32:03,540 --> 05:32:03,860
Okay.

5061
05:32:05,620 --> 05:32:06,500
Have we lost them?

5062
05:32:06,500 --> 05:32:07,940
Like we're we're going pretty far now.

5063
05:32:10,580 --> 05:32:11,780
I'm still going.

5064
05:32:13,860 --> 05:32:14,820
Still going.

5065
05:32:14,820 --> 05:32:15,940
Can I go down here?

5066
05:32:16,580 --> 05:32:17,540
Oh we did it.

5067
05:32:17,540 --> 05:32:18,420
Okay I'm fine.

5068
05:32:18,420 --> 05:32:27,380
We took a neighborhood cat since you're going to fight in Toro Fathom.

5069
05:32:28,500 --> 05:32:35,300
Yeah like literally the health, the veterinary care in Australia is so cheap and good.

5070
05:32:35,940 --> 05:32:40,260
And they were like oh we can like pick up your animal and I'm like oh yes please.

5071
05:32:40,260 --> 05:32:46,900
And I was expecting like $800 or something and it was like super cheap and they were so nice

5072
05:32:46,900 --> 05:32:53,780
and like it was so quick into when I adopted him that I was like I'm so sorry I have absolutely

5073
05:32:53,780 --> 05:32:58,980
no idea what the temperament he's going to be like please be careful he might be aggressive

5074
05:32:58,980 --> 05:33:03,620
like I don't know how he's going to act and they're like oh he was just like a sweet little angel

5075
05:33:03,620 --> 05:33:05,300
and I'm like oh thank you I'm so glad.

5076
05:33:07,060 --> 05:33:08,820
So what happened next with Gimli?

5077
05:33:08,820 --> 05:33:16,340
Oh well through back over the fence and now she's not allowed outside without me being with her

5078
05:33:16,340 --> 05:33:20,420
because she's a silly silly sausage and gives me a heart attack.

5079
05:33:25,220 --> 05:33:30,820
I unfortunately live like on car roads.

5080
05:33:30,820 --> 05:33:38,180
Actually one thing I'll complain about Australia is residential areas don't like have a speed

5081
05:33:38,180 --> 05:33:44,260
limit or the speed limit is ridiculously high and I'm not being funny the speed of freaking cars

5082
05:33:44,260 --> 05:33:51,060
is ridiculous over here it's very Americanized sorry sorry to like be mean and stinky because

5083
05:33:51,060 --> 05:33:57,140
I should be really thankful like that I even have like the ability to like basically like check out

5084
05:33:57,140 --> 05:34:03,540
another country and type thing like I should be grateful and all that but it doesn't mean I'm

5085
05:34:03,540 --> 05:34:10,900
not allowed to complain so I will complain um but I'm trying to think that once hold on.

5086
05:34:11,700 --> 05:34:22,100
So you did literally what she did was climbed up a tree and jumped over a fence so I basically

5087
05:34:24,020 --> 05:34:28,980
now she didn't get hurt before anyone's like oh my god you're was it a linear whatever her name

5088
05:34:28,980 --> 05:34:36,020
was 2.0 or whatever no I put her back on the tree like I like shuggled her back on the tree

5089
05:34:36,820 --> 05:34:40,500
and then I knew she was back in the garden and then I had to run around and go back in

5090
05:34:41,540 --> 05:34:46,980
like in a my garden and bring her back into the house and obviously she was on time at like

5091
05:34:46,980 --> 05:34:53,300
she wasn't not allowed outside for a couple of days after that we know you never helped me yeah

5092
05:34:54,180 --> 05:35:01,220
oh sit in the chat for me while you go home you go into a car crash listen to she be you're joking

5093
05:35:01,940 --> 05:35:10,500
you're joking you're in a car crash you heard it here for

5094
05:35:11,860 --> 05:35:19,940
violor is causing people serious damage to their health you've heard it here first

5095
05:35:22,020 --> 05:35:25,700
I've done all the missions so we can do courtesans we can do these

5096
05:35:26,660 --> 05:35:32,820

5100
05:35:57,540 --> 05:36:03,460

5104
05:36:24,340 --> 05:36:26,260
right we're doing it we're doing a Leonardo

5105
05:36:28,580 --> 05:36:30,340
oh no Majobi's came back

5106
05:36:32,980 --> 05:36:37,060

5107
05:36:37,220 --> 05:36:39,300
uh

5108
05:36:43,300 --> 05:36:47,780

5135
05:39:36,980 --> 05:39:44,740
do not get shot so am I allowed to be spotted or is this a classic warning being detected

5136
05:39:44,740 --> 05:39:50,180
because desynchronization okay I need to go poopy I'm nervous I'm scared of this part of the section

5137
05:39:50,980 --> 05:39:54,740
do you guys want to what happens if we all take a job at the exact same time

5138
05:40:05,060 --> 05:40:10,740
I'm having lots of war and you make sure the the organs are already for this ball man I'm about to drop

okay

5144
05:46:50,180 --> 05:47:20,180
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

5145
05:47:20,180 --> 05:47:38,660
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of of a little bit of a little

5146
05:48:08,660 --> 05:48:26,100
I don't know about you lads but I keep flying over me.

5147
05:48:26,100 --> 05:48:31,020
I'm grabbing my cup of tea and I'm going to make a honey tea, I'll be back in like literally

5148
05:48:31,020 --> 05:48:32,020
a minute.

5149
05:48:32,020 --> 05:48:39,020
I think that was already boiling.

5150
05:49:02,020 --> 05:49:09,020
I'm going to make a honey tea, I'm going to make a honey tea, I'm going to make a honey

5151
05:49:32,020 --> 05:49:39,020
tea.

5152
05:49:39,020 --> 05:49:54,180
Well, I have absolutely horrific news, I've not got any tea bags left, there'll be no

5153
05:49:54,180 --> 05:50:00,100
honey tea for me and this has shot me, that was a moment for me to, I'm so sorry if you

5154
05:50:00,100 --> 05:50:07,100
dropped in on that moment, we all collectively went for the adjubi, I can't believe I'm

5155
05:50:07,100 --> 05:50:12,340
freaking out with tea bags, I'm so annoyed at myself, I'm going to like, the one thing

5156
05:50:12,340 --> 05:50:22,100
I do like about Australian supermarkets, they have big like, eh, stuff, oh my, calibration

5157
05:50:22,100 --> 05:50:29,100
is off, hold on, there, that's my calibration, I don't know why I was looking all the way

5158
05:50:30,100 --> 05:50:41,100
up, I have no idea if we're going to be able to do this, do you want people to tell you

5159
05:50:41,100 --> 05:50:46,100
when the other girls go live or when you ask for it, please always tell me when a girl

5160
05:50:46,100 --> 05:50:57,100
goes live, I can't always keep up and I suck, right, I am not to be tech tech, interesting,

5161
05:50:58,100 --> 05:51:06,100
if I'm not to be detected, wait what am I supposed to do though, locate the architect,

5162
05:51:06,100 --> 05:51:20,100
but don't be detected please, okay, um, I, there's two together, how am I supposed to

5163
05:51:21,100 --> 05:51:28,100
navigate, hmm, you play some games where you versus a chat and hypnotise and so you went

5164
05:51:28,100 --> 05:51:34,100
honestly though, I wanted to do an IQ test and then I want to chat to do an IQ test,

5165
05:51:34,100 --> 05:51:41,100
like we would do a poll for what the answer is and see what like the results are, I am

5166
05:51:41,100 --> 05:52:00,100
very confused, are they going to spot me, wait, what, I love all the bugs in this game,

5167
05:52:01,100 --> 05:52:08,100
full stop, I just love them all, game, don't be detected, then hmm, why is that man on

5168
05:52:08,100 --> 05:52:15,100
the roof, how bizarre, wouldn't work, we make you work for victory, oh no, you guys are

5169
05:52:15,100 --> 05:52:20,100
allowed to win, I wouldn't cheat to do it on the IQ one, but I forget it's a stream where

5170
05:52:20,100 --> 05:52:27,100
I make the album, where the heck am I supposed to go, I assume I'm allowed to kill folk,

5171
05:52:27,100 --> 05:52:36,100
I feel like I need seven bolts, am I going crazy where, is he over there, is that him

5172
05:52:36,100 --> 05:52:52,100
over there, I'm, I'm having a, well, I don't have a choice, yeah I was going to say I don't

5173
05:52:52,100 --> 05:52:59,100
have a choice, because he was coming into the hay bale anyway, lower score is better right,

5174
05:52:59,100 --> 05:53:04,100
I'm going to be number one, chat's IQ is room temperature, but that's why we're so good

5175
05:53:04,100 --> 05:53:12,100
for each other, we're so bad, am I tracking funny with you, I think, oh my tracking is

5176
05:53:12,100 --> 05:53:17,100
funny, I fucking hate this iPhone, for some reason, sorry that got really aggressive out

5177
05:53:18,100 --> 05:53:25,100
here, whenever it is horizontal, it does not track me full stop, horizontal, vertical,

5178
05:53:25,100 --> 05:53:30,100
no, when it's vertical it works, when it's horizontal it doesn't, but I need to charge

5179
05:53:30,100 --> 05:53:36,100
it while I stream, and it's awkward to put it vertical doesn't it, is my tracking being

5180
05:53:36,100 --> 05:53:43,100
rubbish all day, I'll just over enunciate my word, though you guys, I don't know where

5181
05:53:43,100 --> 05:54:08,100
this enemy is, genuinely, I guess I can do this kind of stuff, and loot the bodies, could

5182
05:54:08,100 --> 05:54:16,100
you get some sort of tool to grip it and hold it in there, oh, so it's on like the world's

5183
05:54:16,100 --> 05:54:29,100
tiniest tripod which is adorable, I'm so confused, honestly, I don't know where this person is

5184
05:54:29,100 --> 05:54:37,100
I'm supposed to be trying to find him, I'm going to loot these bodies and hopefully get

5185
05:54:37,100 --> 05:54:47,100
more supplies, because one poison, one medicine wasn't as cool, please expire so I can loot

5186
05:54:47,100 --> 05:54:53,100
your body, sorry, okay there we go, to be honest it's hard to tell if the tracking is

5187
05:54:53,100 --> 05:54:58,100
off or not, since we don't have a reference, alright let me build my webcam let's, where

5188
05:54:58,100 --> 05:55:06,100
is this overseer, is he like in, is he below the church or something, is he in it, is he

5189
05:55:06,100 --> 05:55:20,100
the one by the hay bale, he can't be, um, have I been everywhere yet, I don't know, so those

5190
05:55:20,100 --> 05:55:27,100
were the ones that caught me on the outskirts, is he in the center and that's why, no, what,

5191
05:55:27,100 --> 05:55:39,100
what, did I just, is he like walking around and I just can't tell, yeah the game's telling

5192
05:55:39,100 --> 05:55:50,100
me to stay in this section, I'm on podcast unless as long as it's your birthday, love

5193
05:55:50,100 --> 05:56:00,100
cuteness is smaller they are, the cuter they are, true, I'm, I'm one confuzzled girl,

5194
05:56:00,100 --> 05:56:13,100
look at that, I think we're just going to have to literally go around the map and clean

5195
05:56:13,100 --> 05:56:26,100
it up, because this is, use eagerness to differentiate, yeah but I don't know what to tell you, nothing

5196
05:56:26,100 --> 05:56:39,100
is being highlighted, oh there's guards coming, no they stopped, we're checking the hay bale,

5197
05:56:39,100 --> 05:56:55,100
they're like, those guards from down there coming closer or no, yeah, we will shoot them

5198
05:56:55,100 --> 05:57:01,100
with poison, oh like the game keeps telling me but I don't know what to tell you video

5199
05:57:01,100 --> 05:57:15,100
game, I've literally been to all sections of this map, wait that didn't happen, okay,

5200
05:57:15,100 --> 05:57:23,100
I hit him that time, I'm going to loot their bodies to get all the supplies, we'll meet

5201
05:57:23,100 --> 05:57:38,100
them first, closer to the larger area, is your target in the building?

5202
05:57:38,100 --> 05:57:46,100
more poison there, the one thing that I'll say is a bit funny in this game, NPCs will walk

5203
05:57:46,100 --> 05:57:57,100
into guards that are like flailing about and it's like bro, hopefully I can get more ammo

5204
05:57:57,100 --> 05:58:04,100
off these guys and I'm not spending more, I'm getting more poison back which is fine,

5205
05:58:04,100 --> 05:58:19,100
I'm spending poison, it's good to get poison back but my goodness, okay, so he does just

5206
05:58:19,100 --> 05:58:41,100
roam the map, okay, all those guards, I don't want to be these things because I stopped,

5207
05:58:41,100 --> 05:58:46,100
I didn't realize he turned back, I'm very confused with this mission so like I had to find him

5208
05:58:46,100 --> 05:58:52,100
walking around and there's guards everywhere, I'm going to go on the roof because there's

5209
05:58:52,100 --> 05:59:00,100
that rotating jewel here, there's, oh maybe a desync if he notices that people are ill

5210
05:59:00,100 --> 05:59:13,100
with poison, I don't know, beat up the architect, hopefully this gives me a loading point, give

5211
05:59:13,100 --> 05:59:34,100
me the plans right now, oh yeah, honestly me, that took so long to progress, I do apologize,

5212
05:59:34,100 --> 05:59:44,100
that must mean painful, right so what happens now, I'm notorious, okay I can deal with that,

5213
05:59:44,100 --> 05:59:50,100
I've definitely progressed to the next loading screen so again we've not failed 100%, do not

5214
05:59:50,100 --> 05:59:57,100
get shot while using the bomber, surely I will do this first time when I get on the bomber,

5215
05:59:57,100 --> 06:00:02,100
surely I will not have any issues at all and I'm not going to be frustrated with this game

5216
06:00:02,100 --> 06:00:10,100
mode, I'm already preparing for it, can I launch on that, oh it hits you over there, oh sorry,

5217
06:00:10,100 --> 06:00:22,100
I need to impair sleep right now so don't get caught, now I have the interest, surely

5218
06:00:22,100 --> 06:00:41,100
absolutely helping copium right, next loading point please, oh I'm at, I'm to not be detected

5219
06:00:41,100 --> 06:00:48,100
by the two guards that are across from each other, yeah I'm not to be detected by the two

5220
06:00:48,100 --> 06:00:57,100
point blank guards, I can do this if that citizen doesn't get in the way and then he will be

5221
06:00:57,100 --> 06:01:08,100
distracted by him, I said he will be distracted by the poisoned guy, can you, oh and now everyone's

5222
06:01:08,100 --> 06:01:20,100
in the way, get the fuck out of my way, Jesus, I know why they make the minstrels like that

5223
06:01:20,100 --> 06:01:27,100
but they've made them a little too well, okay they've made them a little too well, okay yeah

5224
06:01:27,100 --> 06:01:34,100
my tracking is like bugging out because it's horizontal, I despise you, there's no way

5225
06:01:34,100 --> 06:01:42,100
or maybe it's the iPhone, hold on, let me cook for the thing, I'm trying to see if I can stand up on it

5226
06:01:42,100 --> 06:01:46,100
so I have my elaborate setup from yesterday because I removed all the cups from my ring

5227
06:01:46,100 --> 06:02:04,100
look at the mask, when I have the perfect setup, that looks much more, okay and then we'll look

5228
06:02:04,100 --> 06:02:11,100
for supplies, the per NPCs, I just know we're gonna fail this and I'm gonna be so mad

5229
06:02:11,100 --> 06:02:17,100
because I don't know what to expect

5230
06:02:25,100 --> 06:02:37,100
these poison darts for distraction is absolutely gorgeous, these NPCs in my fucking way, not gorgeous

5231
06:02:38,100 --> 06:02:45,100
okay he's gonna start attacking, I can see the ones coming down the hill

5232
06:02:45,100 --> 06:02:57,100
I don't know if they're gonna, oh no, oh no they got attracted, I'm just gonna hide in here

5233
06:02:58,100 --> 06:03:03,100
unleash the archers, you're evening skulls, I'm nervous

5234
06:03:03,100 --> 06:03:06,100
I don't know what to do here

5235
06:03:10,100 --> 06:03:17,100
I'm just kind of waiting around, like waiting for the EI to kick in so I don't know what to do now

5236
06:03:17,100 --> 06:03:19,100
oh yeah, that

5237
06:03:23,100 --> 06:03:25,100
must have been drinking the good stuff

5238
06:03:28,100 --> 06:03:35,100
okay, we're just gonna poison them both again, like literally poison darts

5239
06:03:35,100 --> 06:03:42,100
don't be afraid to lock onto them when they can see us, no it's fine, honestly don't be afraid

5240
06:03:42,100 --> 06:03:50,100
no, miss, shit, we cannot be missing poison darts, no, next one, use the other guy

5241
06:03:50,100 --> 06:03:56,100
okay there we are, we're gonna loot these two bodies so we can refill our poison

5242
06:03:56,100 --> 06:04:02,100
we're taking it nice and slow, should charts start logging every bird, nah

5243
06:04:05,100 --> 06:04:10,100
okay these are both poisoned, again we're gonna pick up, we're just gonna take it nice and slow

5244
06:04:10,100 --> 06:04:19,100
you know, we don't need it too fast, just relax, calming, cozy atmosphere

5245
06:04:28,100 --> 06:04:34,100
but remember, don't get shot when we are in the glider and I know I'm going through these things

5246
06:04:35,100 --> 06:04:37,100
I'll still finish it anyway but

5247
06:04:40,100 --> 06:04:43,100
oh yeah, wow, you get a lot more from them, okay I'm quite happy with that

5248
06:04:45,100 --> 06:04:50,100
she be redirect, oh no, they're all gonna see my terrible gameplay and me getting mad now

5249
06:04:57,100 --> 06:04:59,100
they're gonna know I'm a terrible gamer

5250
06:05:01,100 --> 06:05:05,100
nice cozy atmosphere, remember the guys gagging and choking on the background, literally

5251
06:05:05,100 --> 06:05:07,100
I'm gonna just move a whistle through my teeth there

5252
06:05:11,100 --> 06:05:15,100
your gameplay isn't terrible, it's rough on the DLC stuff cause like

5253
06:05:16,100 --> 06:05:18,100
I don't know, there's anyone up here

5254
06:05:23,100 --> 06:05:28,100
oh my gosh

5255
06:05:29,100 --> 06:05:39,100
I've just remembered how humongous this is, we have to get up there but we have to go like

5256
06:05:40,100 --> 06:05:43,100
and do all this dodgy stuff constant back and forth

5257
06:05:44,100 --> 06:05:47,100
oh no

5258
06:05:48,100 --> 06:05:51,100
oh no

5259
06:05:52,100 --> 06:05:58,100
no, he can't see us again, he needs to forget about us like right now

5260
06:06:02,100 --> 06:06:04,100
he needs to like, okay

5261
06:06:05,100 --> 06:06:08,100
wow, that was dangerous

5262
06:06:12,100 --> 06:06:15,100
hold on, I think we'll be in best, get by another guard

5263
06:06:15,100 --> 06:06:17,100
there's one in there

5264
06:06:18,100 --> 06:06:22,100
yeah and he's moving out, oh there's two of them, we're investigating the bodies

5265
06:06:23,100 --> 06:06:27,100
I don't want to go down, I'd rather stay on the walls and go around to this tower stuff

5266
06:06:32,100 --> 06:06:37,100
oh my goodness, she be caught and bummer self, thank you for the wade

5267
06:06:38,100 --> 06:06:42,100

wait, both Emmy too?

5271
06:06:57,100 --> 06:07:00,100
you both ended stream at the same time, oh my gosh

5272
06:07:01,100 --> 06:07:03,100
hi guys

5273
06:07:04,100 --> 06:07:09,100
oh my god, you both ended stream at the same time, I don't know maybe you should like kiss or something

5274
06:07:09,100 --> 06:07:13,100
please, I don't know maybe you should give each other a little kiss

5275
06:07:14,100 --> 06:07:16,100
if you're just like so in tune with each other

5276
06:07:19,100 --> 06:07:27,100
please, Emmy riddy she be, she be riddy due into cycles, please get lots of water and food, she be

5277
06:07:28,100 --> 06:07:30,100
don't want you having any hangovers

5278
06:07:31,100 --> 06:07:32,100
hi Emmy

5279
06:07:33,100 --> 06:07:37,100
hope you both enjoyed your stream, hope you enjoyed your stream

5280
06:07:37,100 --> 06:07:42,100
we are currently doing Leonardo's missions

5281
06:07:43,100 --> 06:07:48,100
and I'm currently debating if I'm actually capable of 100% in this game

5282
06:07:49,100 --> 06:07:56,100
unfortunately my answer is, it might be a no, I don't actually think I have the thingy

5283
06:07:57,100 --> 06:07:59,100
just guarantee the vods getting nuked, okay

5284
06:08:00,100 --> 06:08:02,100
guys, I'm trying to get you monetized on YouTube

5285
06:08:03,100 --> 06:08:05,100
right, I can get him in time, fine

5286
06:08:06,100 --> 06:08:08,100
him, I need this archer over here done, yeah

5287
06:08:09,100 --> 06:08:10,100
okay, I'm glad that looks

5288
06:08:11,100 --> 06:08:12,100
that's good

5289
06:08:12,100 --> 06:08:13,100
is that a flag over there?

5290
06:08:14,100 --> 06:08:15,100
I don't know, maybe just a treasure

5291
06:08:17,100 --> 06:08:20,100
sorry, it's fine, I'm teasing, you guys can do what you want

5292
06:08:23,100 --> 06:08:25,100
I need to go there?

5293
06:08:25,100 --> 06:08:26,100
what?

5294
06:08:28,100 --> 06:08:30,100
oh goodness me

5295
06:08:30,100 --> 06:08:32,100
what is that?

5296
06:08:34,100 --> 06:08:38,100
I actually think I want that guard to forget I exist

5297
06:08:42,100 --> 06:08:44,100
she seems so worn out, it's fine

5298
06:08:45,100 --> 06:08:48,100
we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood 2

5299
06:08:49,100 --> 06:08:51,100
which is a very beloved childhood game of mine

5300
06:08:52,100 --> 06:08:58,100
I believe Mercy is coming online in 1, 2, 3 hours, just under 3 hours

5301
06:08:58,100 --> 06:09:05,100
so if you are a snippet, you are welcome to hang about till it's Mercy time

5302
06:09:08,100 --> 06:09:11,100
that's very, oh that guy up there, I don't like him

5303
06:09:14,100 --> 06:09:18,100
I think I'm gonna have to start looting bodies as well because I'm running low on ammo

5304
06:09:29,100 --> 06:09:35,100
so that was actually rather cute

5305
06:09:36,100 --> 06:09:38,100
oh what a post to be left in

5306
06:09:39,100 --> 06:09:41,100
POV, you're a harem

5307
06:09:42,100 --> 06:09:45,100
that's the position she be gonna leave you in at the end of the night

5308
06:09:48,100 --> 06:09:50,100
yep, no bod, it's already dead

5309
06:09:54,100 --> 06:09:56,100
wait, it already got a warning?

5310
06:09:56,100 --> 06:09:57,100
that was pretty quick

5311
06:09:59,100 --> 06:10:02,100
that was pretty rough, Jesus

5312
06:10:02,100 --> 06:10:05,100
I private it over for you, ah, I should have gone

5313
06:10:07,100 --> 06:10:09,100
let's see, let's do poison

5314
06:10:13,100 --> 06:10:15,100
oh let's not do poison again

5315
06:10:20,100 --> 06:10:23,100
she be making a smart move, 5 head now

5316
06:10:24,100 --> 06:10:27,100
this is so sad, I'm only good to see half of it

5317
06:10:28,100 --> 06:10:31,100
there's always more ASMR streams to come in the future, don't worry

5318
06:10:32,100 --> 06:10:33,100
it's not one and done

5319
06:10:34,100 --> 06:10:36,100
we ain't one and done around these parts

5320
06:10:37,100 --> 06:10:39,100
hopefully YouTube gets her stuff messed

5321
06:10:40,100 --> 06:10:43,100
there's a few things going on with YouTube right now

5322
06:10:45,100 --> 06:10:47,100
this is a very slow based mission by the way

5323
06:10:47,100 --> 06:10:49,100
because every time we poison, I have to wait until they're perished

5324
06:10:49,100 --> 06:10:52,100
and then I have to loot them and then I have to go for the next part

5325
06:10:52,100 --> 06:10:54,100
I don't know if I can reach him from here

5326
06:10:56,100 --> 06:10:58,100
just out of sight, but I need him gone

5327
06:11:01,100 --> 06:11:03,100
I need him gone or I can't be jumping around this tower

5328
06:11:05,100 --> 06:11:08,100
he's got a range of these guys, but I'm not with him

5329
06:11:08,100 --> 06:11:10,100
Strani, you're always streaming, are you okay?

5330
06:11:10,100 --> 06:11:12,100
ah, yeah, it's called

5331
06:11:13,100 --> 06:11:16,100
I am sharing my childhood games and I love them

5332
06:11:16,100 --> 06:11:18,100
and I want to share them

5333
06:11:19,100 --> 06:11:21,100
it's a bit more cozy the day yesterday

5334
06:11:21,100 --> 06:11:23,100
I was a bit, can he see me?

5335
06:11:26,100 --> 06:11:27,100
he can

5336
06:11:28,100 --> 06:11:29,100
man needs glasses

5337
06:11:30,100 --> 06:11:32,100
I mean, whoever will literally leave you up

5338
06:11:32,100 --> 06:11:33,100
true

5339
06:11:37,100 --> 06:11:39,100
lovely, lovely stuff

5340
06:11:42,100 --> 06:11:45,100
we will be taking this very easy

5341
06:11:48,100 --> 06:11:52,100
I am not sure how to get down

5342
06:11:56,100 --> 06:12:00,100
out of safety, we're going to be doing a lot of poison right now

5343
06:12:02,100 --> 06:12:05,100
I don't know if I can leap from there to that

5344
06:12:05,100 --> 06:12:07,100
and I don't want to risk it

5345
06:12:07,100 --> 06:12:09,100
that looks like a leap over, definitely

5346
06:12:09,100 --> 06:12:11,100
like that 100% looks like a leap over

5347
06:12:14,100 --> 06:12:16,100
they're currently poisoned below me

5348
06:12:16,100 --> 06:12:18,100
but I should be safe to make my

5349
06:12:20,100 --> 06:12:22,100
there's a lot of red there

5350
06:12:22,100 --> 06:12:25,100
I think this is definitely what I'm supposed to do though

5351
06:12:27,100 --> 06:12:30,100
a 12 and a 6 hour plus stream on your first week is awe inspiring

5352
06:12:30,100 --> 06:12:32,100
I just really enjoy these video games

5353
06:12:32,100 --> 06:12:34,100
I definitely will be focusing

5354
06:12:34,100 --> 06:12:38,100
please don't think my streams are all going to be 18 hours

5355
06:12:38,100 --> 06:12:40,100
tomorrow's needy streamer overload

5356
06:12:40,100 --> 06:12:43,100
I've never played it before, but it's definitely going to be a shorter stream

5357
06:12:44,100 --> 06:12:47,100
because I don't even know if I like it

5358
06:12:47,100 --> 06:12:50,100
and whenever I have the

5359
06:12:52,100 --> 06:12:54,100
what happens if I spin around

5360
06:12:55,100 --> 06:12:56,100
a beam

5361
06:12:57,100 --> 06:12:58,100
and a

5362
06:13:00,100 --> 06:13:02,100
neat poison, these two down here

5363
06:13:02,100 --> 06:13:03,100
not risking it

5364
06:13:06,100 --> 06:13:08,100
not risking it at all

5365
06:13:08,100 --> 06:13:10,100
we have come too far

5366
06:13:11,100 --> 06:13:13,100
right onto the beam

5367
06:13:15,100 --> 06:13:17,100
I'm just going poison route

5368
06:13:17,100 --> 06:13:20,100
because poison stops them from being able to see me

5369
06:13:26,100 --> 06:13:28,100
I'm going to loot this guy's body

5370
06:13:28,100 --> 06:13:31,100
because archers normally have a lot more stuff on them

5371
06:13:33,100 --> 06:13:35,100
cuttlefish are venomous

5372
06:13:35,100 --> 06:13:37,100
there is one cuttlefish that's venomous

5373
06:13:37,100 --> 06:13:39,100
but my ink isn't venomous

5374
06:13:39,100 --> 06:13:41,100
it's an aphrodisiac

5375
06:13:43,100 --> 06:13:46,100
it puts you under my alluring spell

5376
06:13:49,100 --> 06:13:51,100
what is bro doing with poison though

5377
06:13:53,100 --> 06:13:55,100
the lead artist for needy streamer overload

5378
06:13:55,100 --> 06:13:56,100
is one of my favorite artists

5379
06:13:56,100 --> 06:13:58,100
I'm a sucker for

5380
06:13:58,100 --> 06:14:00,100
oh his son

5381
06:14:00,100 --> 06:14:01,100
she booties

5382
06:14:01,100 --> 06:14:02,100
stuff

5383
06:14:02,100 --> 06:14:05,100
right we need to be super careful

5384
06:14:05,100 --> 06:14:07,100
because this is the most ridiculous

5385
06:14:07,100 --> 06:14:10,100
thing for trying to spot enemies

5386
06:14:10,100 --> 06:14:13,100
there's like guys all the way up this tower

5387
06:14:13,100 --> 06:14:16,100
and it's so hard to know when one's about to see you

5388
06:14:16,100 --> 06:14:19,100
and I'm not freaking redoing this all over again

5389
06:14:20,100 --> 06:14:22,100
but I'm getting scared

5390
06:14:22,100 --> 06:14:24,100
okay I can see one guy up there

5391
06:14:24,100 --> 06:14:26,100
it must be they're all on the roof

5392
06:14:28,100 --> 06:14:30,100
under your lure

5393
06:14:30,100 --> 06:14:32,100
not your resa...

5394
06:14:32,100 --> 06:14:34,100
you might have a streaming edition

5395
06:14:34,100 --> 06:14:36,100
I can't believe it

5396
06:14:37,100 --> 06:14:39,100
oh almost fell there

5397
06:14:41,100 --> 06:14:44,100
you said you might not be able to 100% it

5398
06:14:46,100 --> 06:14:49,100
there's a few 100%

5399
06:14:49,100 --> 06:14:52,100
that I genuinely don't know

5400
06:14:53,100 --> 06:14:55,100
and I'm worried about

5401
06:14:55,100 --> 06:14:57,100
not being able to do my

5402
06:14:57,100 --> 06:14:59,100
like I just simply cannot do it

5403
06:14:59,100 --> 06:15:01,100
and I can't like call

5404
06:15:01,100 --> 06:15:03,100
I can't tap one of you guys into the game to do it for me

5405
06:15:04,100 --> 06:15:06,100
so I'm still

5406
06:15:06,100 --> 06:15:09,100
I'm still not sure this is going to be a 12 hour stream or not

5407
06:15:10,100 --> 06:15:12,100
I can hear the music

5408
06:15:14,100 --> 06:15:16,100
how am I supposed to hurt them all at once

5409
06:15:16,100 --> 06:15:18,100
I don't think I...

5410
06:15:23,100 --> 06:15:25,100
is that a flag this way?

5411
06:15:26,100 --> 06:15:29,100
no what? the sun's getting further away

5412
06:15:30,100 --> 06:15:32,100
uh...

5413
06:15:32,100 --> 06:15:34,100
why?

5414
06:15:35,100 --> 06:15:37,100
what am I supposed to do?

5415
06:15:37,100 --> 06:15:39,100
no!

5416
06:15:41,100 --> 06:15:42,100
okay

5417
06:15:42,100 --> 06:15:44,100
okay

5418
06:15:44,100 --> 06:15:46,100
I understand

5419
06:15:46,100 --> 06:15:49,100
I thought I was about to be exposed right at the end there

5420
06:15:49,100 --> 06:15:50,100
right

5421
06:15:50,100 --> 06:15:52,100
in order to 100% this mission

5422
06:15:53,100 --> 06:15:56,100
do not get shot while using the bomber

5423
06:15:56,100 --> 06:15:57,100
okay

5424
06:15:57,100 --> 06:16:00,100
we have been at this mission for like 20 minutes now

5425
06:16:00,100 --> 06:16:03,100
all I have to do is nail this off the bat

5426
06:16:03,100 --> 06:16:06,100
and I don't even remember freakin' doing this

5427
06:16:08,100 --> 06:16:10,100
I'm going to start sweating

5428
06:16:12,100 --> 06:16:14,100
okay

5429
06:16:17,100 --> 06:16:20,100
don't get shot using the bomber

5430
06:16:21,100 --> 06:16:24,100
why can we not get like a little tutorial first?

5431
06:16:24,100 --> 06:16:25,100
destroy the workshops

5432
06:16:25,100 --> 06:16:26,100
I can do that

5433
06:16:26,100 --> 06:16:27,100
I can do that

5434
06:16:27,100 --> 06:16:28,100
it's fine

5435
06:16:28,100 --> 06:16:29,100
tactical camera

5436
06:16:29,100 --> 06:16:30,100
no not tactical

5437
06:16:30,100 --> 06:16:31,100
that was awful

5438
06:16:31,100 --> 06:16:33,100
don't ever do that again

5439
06:16:34,100 --> 06:16:36,100
press retreat to fire

5440
06:16:36,100 --> 06:16:37,100
R2

5441
06:16:37,100 --> 06:16:38,100
oh no

5442
06:16:38,100 --> 06:16:39,100
oh my god I'm going down

5443
06:16:39,100 --> 06:16:40,100
this is not good

5444
06:16:40,100 --> 06:16:41,100
this is not good

5445
06:16:41,100 --> 06:16:43,100
oh my god I don't know the controls

5446
06:16:43,100 --> 06:16:45,100
I don't know the controls

5447
06:16:45,100 --> 06:16:48,100
oh I don't know where the closest one on the map is

5448
06:16:49,100 --> 06:16:51,100
it's the one...

5449
06:16:52,100 --> 06:16:53,100
if I take her right

5450
06:16:53,100 --> 06:16:54,100
I don't think I'm gonna make it

5451
06:16:54,100 --> 06:16:56,100
just go for the one that I'm hitting at

5452
06:16:56,100 --> 06:16:58,100
oh my god there's archer towers

5453
06:16:58,100 --> 06:17:01,100
no no no no no no no no no

5454
06:17:09,100 --> 06:17:11,100
how?

5455
06:17:12,100 --> 06:17:13,100
how?

5456
06:17:13,100 --> 06:17:16,100
how were you not supposed to get hit by that?

5457
06:17:16,100 --> 06:17:18,100
oh I didn't even hit that tower

5458
06:17:19,100 --> 06:17:21,100
yeah see this is what I'm afraid of

5459
06:17:21,100 --> 06:17:23,100
I can't 100%

5460
06:17:23,100 --> 06:17:27,100
I'm under the impression I now have to redo this entire

5461
06:17:27,100 --> 06:17:29,100
entire mission again

5462
06:17:29,100 --> 06:17:31,100
I missed that again?

5463
06:17:33,100 --> 06:17:34,100
I'm trying so hard

5464
06:17:34,100 --> 06:17:37,100
I think I'm gonna have to like go further away

5465
06:17:37,100 --> 06:17:39,100
I don't think there's a checkpoint

5466
06:17:39,100 --> 06:17:41,100
I never gave an indication

5467
06:17:41,100 --> 06:17:43,100
wait for one

5468
06:17:45,100 --> 06:17:47,100
okay there we go

5469
06:17:47,100 --> 06:17:48,100
shoot workshop twi-

5470
06:17:48,100 --> 06:17:50,100
whoa whoa whoa my controller Jesus

5471
06:17:51,100 --> 06:17:53,100
oh please my goodness

5472
06:17:53,100 --> 06:17:55,100
I almost didn't make it there

5473
06:17:55,100 --> 06:17:57,100
alright do that

5474
06:17:58,100 --> 06:18:00,100
okay then do this

5475
06:18:01,100 --> 06:18:03,100
and I missed so that's okay

5476
06:18:03,100 --> 06:18:05,100
we just need to do it

5477
06:18:05,100 --> 06:18:06,100
go around a bit

5478
06:18:06,100 --> 06:18:08,100
oh well maybe we're gonna just straight up attack this one

5479
06:18:10,100 --> 06:18:11,100
I missed

5480
06:18:16,100 --> 06:18:18,100
hopefully there is checkpoints

5481
06:18:18,100 --> 06:18:21,100
cause this that does seem very harsh

5482
06:18:21,100 --> 06:18:23,100
I completely I did

5483
06:18:23,100 --> 06:18:25,100
I will admit I twided off

5484
06:18:25,100 --> 06:18:27,100
I need a fire like right now

5485
06:18:28,100 --> 06:18:30,100
oh goodness me

5486
06:18:30,100 --> 06:18:32,100
goodness gravy

5487
06:18:32,100 --> 06:18:34,100
they didn't even make this game easy

5488
06:18:36,100 --> 06:18:38,100
there we go destroyed that one

5489
06:18:39,100 --> 06:18:42,100
honestly this section was a lot harder on paper

5490
06:18:42,100 --> 06:18:44,100
I think

5491
06:18:45,100 --> 06:18:47,100
there

5492
06:18:47,100 --> 06:18:49,100
right now what?

5493
06:18:52,100 --> 06:18:54,100
only if you die you have to repeat whole missions

5494
06:18:58,100 --> 06:19:00,100
a checkpoint at the start of the bomb

5495
06:19:00,100 --> 06:19:02,100
destroy the bomber

5496
06:19:02,100 --> 06:19:04,100
where I see

5497
06:19:04,100 --> 06:19:06,100
speed run over there

5498
06:19:08,100 --> 06:19:09,100
can we aimbot it?

5499
06:19:09,100 --> 06:19:10,100
three two one

5500
06:19:10,100 --> 06:19:12,100
oh I think that was a miss

5501
06:19:12,100 --> 06:19:14,100
a swing and a miss

5502
06:19:14,100 --> 06:19:15,100
swing and a miss

5503
06:19:15,100 --> 06:19:17,100
hold on let's try again

5504
06:19:19,100 --> 06:19:20,100
oh wow

5505
06:19:20,100 --> 06:19:22,100
I cannot control this right now

5506
06:19:22,100 --> 06:19:24,100
I'm completely looking in the wrong direction

5507
06:19:26,100 --> 06:19:27,100
I

5508
06:19:27,100 --> 06:19:29,100

5509
06:19:29,100 --> 06:19:30,100

yeah

5514
06:19:36,100 --> 06:19:37,100
okay

5515
06:19:37,100 --> 06:19:39,100
controls please thank you

5516
06:19:39,100 --> 06:19:41,100
oh no there's more

5517
06:19:42,100 --> 06:19:44,100
okay okay it's okay it's okay

5518
06:19:44,100 --> 06:19:47,100
I'm just trying to set a fire along the way

5519
06:19:47,100 --> 06:19:49,100
I am hello game

5520
06:19:49,100 --> 06:19:51,100
respond please

5521
06:19:51,100 --> 06:19:53,100
I missed and it's okay

5522
06:19:53,100 --> 06:19:54,100
it's okay

5523
06:19:58,100 --> 06:20:00,100
we're gonna bomb that get a bit of speed

5524
06:20:00,100 --> 06:20:01,100
whoa

5525
06:20:01,100 --> 06:20:03,100
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

5526
06:20:03,100 --> 06:20:04,100
whoa

5527
06:20:05,100 --> 06:20:06,100
hello game

5528
06:20:06,100 --> 06:20:07,100
relax

5529
06:20:07,100 --> 06:20:08,100
relax

5530
06:20:08,100 --> 06:20:09,100
relax

5531
06:20:09,100 --> 06:20:10,100
game

5532
06:20:10,100 --> 06:20:12,100
what on air I thought I don't think

5533
06:20:12,100 --> 06:20:14,180
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

5534
06:20:14,180 --> 06:20:16,180
whoa whoa whoa whoa

5535
06:20:16,180 --> 06:20:17,220
bruv部

5536
06:20:18,100 --> 06:20:19,100
game

5537
06:20:19,100 --> 06:20:21,100
what was that velocity

5538
06:20:21,100 --> 06:20:23,100
it was completely unnecessary are you sure

5539
06:20:23,100 --> 06:20:24,100
game

5540
06:20:24,100 --> 06:20:25,100
put me up

5541
06:20:25,100 --> 06:20:27,100
put me up put me up put me up

5542
06:20:27,100 --> 06:20:29,100
I went ups so I can aim

5543
06:20:30,100 --> 06:20:31,100
a miss

5544
06:20:31,100 --> 06:20:32,100
oh wow

5545
06:20:32,100 --> 06:20:34,100
I actually hit that

5546
06:20:34,100 --> 06:20:36,100
wow

5547
06:20:36,100 --> 06:20:38,100
that was crazy

5548
06:20:38,100 --> 06:20:40,340
I don't think I was supposed to fly that high that was

5549
06:20:43,220 --> 06:20:45,220
Oops played out of order

5550
06:20:45,940 --> 06:20:47,940
Where's this a horse? Okay?

5551
06:20:48,420 --> 06:20:50,420
turn around

5552
06:20:50,740 --> 06:20:54,980
Every now and then I get this. Oh, I was too early. Hmm. Maybe there then

5553
06:20:55,860 --> 06:20:57,140
Yes

5554
06:20:57,140 --> 06:20:59,380
Yeah, okay. That wasn't bad. That wasn't horrific

5555
06:21:01,620 --> 06:21:03,620
Wow

5556
06:21:04,500 --> 06:21:09,060
That was a crazy boost. I don't think I was supposed to go that high. I think the game mathematics

5557
06:21:09,700 --> 06:21:11,700
It's weird

5558
06:21:15,700 --> 06:21:17,700
Okay

5559
06:21:19,540 --> 06:21:23,380
There's cool guys don't look at back at explosion

5560
06:21:24,900 --> 06:21:26,900
Well, we did it

5561
06:21:26,900 --> 06:21:28,900
That was not easy. That was not fast

5562
06:21:29,060 --> 06:21:33,940
I am going to open it up in the dna sequence to see if it's like replay that section

5563
06:21:34,500 --> 06:21:38,420
If it is then a hundred percent, it's still on board if it's not then a hundred percent

5564
06:21:38,420 --> 06:21:41,140
It's like a much less likely because this is getting hard

5565
06:21:42,340 --> 06:21:44,340
This is getting tricky

5566
06:21:45,300 --> 06:21:47,300
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky

5567
06:21:48,340 --> 06:21:51,460
Rock around rock around just right on time. It's tricky

5568
06:21:59,540 --> 06:22:10,900
The whole thing I was worried it would say that

5569
06:22:13,620 --> 06:22:16,020
I was so worried it was gonna say that

5570
06:22:24,020 --> 06:22:26,020
Look we'll do what we can

5571
06:22:26,020 --> 06:22:31,060
We'll finish the other like Leonardo missions and that

5572
06:22:32,580 --> 06:22:35,940
But yeah, this is gonna be I don't

5573
06:22:37,300 --> 06:22:44,420
That has just like dramatically decreased the odds of being able to a hundred percent it like to go through all of that section

5574
06:22:44,980 --> 06:22:49,460
Again, like I was taking my time like poisoning guards along the way so I didn't have any issues

5575
06:22:50,980 --> 06:22:52,260
that

5576
06:22:52,260 --> 06:22:56,820
That one attempt and we got hit immediately that was the only time we got hit as well

5577
06:22:56,900 --> 06:23:00,100
Which was just so unlucky because I wasn't sure what the controls were

5578
06:23:01,060 --> 06:23:04,420
Like that was so rough. I just jumped us. Come on that horse

5579
06:23:06,020 --> 06:23:10,020
And that is why late game gives more check literally that is so

5580
06:23:11,700 --> 06:23:13,700
Um punishing

5581
06:23:15,060 --> 06:23:17,060
Wait, can you a hundred percent this game without being online?

5582
06:23:17,460 --> 06:23:19,700
Yes, the dna sequence is what we're a hundred percent

5583
06:23:19,700 --> 06:23:22,980
It's like doing a hundred percent of the memories and stuff. I'm currently

5584
06:23:23,940 --> 06:23:26,900
63 percent, which isn't bad at all

5585
06:23:27,620 --> 06:23:28,980
however

5586
06:23:28,980 --> 06:23:36,260
I was under the assumption the game was a bit more forgiving. However, we've just kind of discovered

5587
06:23:37,220 --> 06:23:44,660
The replayability checkpoints aren't necessarily all there on certain missions and that is just so

5588
06:23:46,180 --> 06:23:48,180
I don't know. I don't know

5589
06:23:49,860 --> 06:23:51,460
Let me see that

5590
06:23:51,460 --> 06:23:54,420
Okay, go. Yeah. Yeah. Remember trying for

5591
06:23:55,140 --> 06:23:56,980
platinum to give

5592
06:23:56,980 --> 06:23:59,140
Achievement wise

5593
06:23:59,140 --> 06:24:03,060
I don't know if you need a hundred percent dna for the achievements

5594
06:24:04,580 --> 06:24:07,540
War machines are infamous for a reason. Yeah

5595
06:24:09,540 --> 06:24:12,580
There's a difference in a hundred to give a hundred percent achievements. Um

5596
06:24:13,380 --> 06:24:20,900
So, yeah, I thought we could maybe attempt to a hundred percent the dna sequence, but yeah

5597
06:24:21,700 --> 06:24:26,260
It ain't looking good. I mean, how long oh, it's already been six hours. What the heck?

5598
06:24:28,500 --> 06:24:30,020
Okay

5599
06:24:30,020 --> 06:24:32,580
Yeah, I didn't like I thought I was only gonna

5600
06:24:32,980 --> 06:24:34,980
What was I supposed to do?

5601
06:24:34,980 --> 06:24:39,940
Use a kick attack against over here. I literally thought

5602
06:24:40,580 --> 06:24:42,580
Um

5603
06:24:44,820 --> 06:24:47,940
If you don't do it now move these kids should be a thing you come back to at a later time

5604
06:24:48,180 --> 06:24:51,460
I think so. I think three days of like Assassin's Creed brotherhood in a row is a bit

5605
06:24:51,860 --> 06:24:57,060
It's a bit too much, but I'm perfectly happy to like come across the save file. That's not a problem

5606
06:24:57,140 --> 06:24:59,140
Um

5607
06:25:08,580 --> 06:25:10,580
Oh, no, no, we're not doing this

5608
06:25:15,300 --> 06:25:17,940
We're not doing this horse feature, but leave me alone. You're scaring me

5609
06:25:18,900 --> 06:25:20,900
Oh

5610
06:25:25,140 --> 06:25:29,460
Oh, whoa, I actually dodged that successfully, but the game said no, so

5611
06:25:33,300 --> 06:25:38,740
I true love with this game with a hundred percent. Oh steady on have you seen what the requirements are on some of the missions? Oh

5612
06:25:40,340 --> 06:25:42,340
That a wee bit of a

5613
06:25:42,660 --> 06:25:45,620
That a wee bit much for me honestly like I love this game

5614
06:25:45,860 --> 06:25:47,860
But I think, um

5615
06:25:49,140 --> 06:25:51,140
Definitely

5616
06:25:51,300 --> 06:25:55,940
Wouldn't mind coming back to to attempt it, but I think three days of Assassin's Creed brotherhood in a row

5617
06:25:55,940 --> 06:26:04,260
Maybe ain't the choice. We'll try and needy streamer and it'll be a smaller stream tomorrow, which means I can go get the

5618
06:26:06,100 --> 06:26:10,020
Sweets that I'm using for that hand cam stream. I need to like prepare for it and saw

5619
06:26:10,420 --> 06:26:16,420
I don't even know what to wear. He he I'm actually gonna have to put clothes on for one

5620
06:26:19,620 --> 06:26:21,620
Uh, I don't even know

5621
06:26:24,740 --> 06:26:30,260
And one achievement requires you to reach level 50. Oh, yeah, no, no, not those achievements like the dna

5622
06:26:32,180 --> 06:26:34,180
Are we going up?

Open one of the first three game the bourgeois have constructed a deadly naval war machine base on the in our design

5626
06:26:47,620 --> 06:26:50,020
It must be destroyed before chesery

5627
06:26:51,380 --> 06:26:54,100
Good dreams. Talk to Eduraro

5628
06:26:56,420 --> 06:26:58,420

06:27:12,260 --> 06:27:15,460
No, I'm a fish. You didn't see me

06:27:16,260 --> 06:27:19,620
I'm just a fish a fishy fishy fish

5634
06:27:20,340 --> 06:27:22,820
Swimming in the deep canal

06:27:24,660 --> 06:27:26,660
Fish fishy swim

5636
06:27:27,140 --> 06:27:29,140
Um, actually

5637
06:27:29,860 --> 06:27:33,460
If you hold the block button with the sword ball in the horse coming out, you can knock the raider then

5638
06:27:34,500 --> 06:27:36,660
Oh, it's it was gasman prayer me

06:28:08,020 --> 06:28:10,020
Like I said, I chose life today. Thank you

5645
06:28:15,860 --> 06:28:20,820
Uh interacting with the gondola will cause desynchronization

5646
06:28:21,140 --> 06:28:23,140
I

5647
06:28:24,020 --> 06:28:26,020
I scratch my nose

5648
06:28:28,740 --> 06:28:31,620
How taller you 162 centimeters

5649
06:28:32,660 --> 06:28:33,780

5650
06:28:33,780 --> 06:28:35,780
taller than

5651
06:28:36,580 --> 06:28:40,020
Smoke bomb disables guards assassin or sleep before it wears off

5652
06:28:42,180 --> 06:28:49,460
Um, excuse me, but the actual phone am I not allowed to kill? Oh, so why not?

5653
06:28:51,860 --> 06:28:53,860
Uh

5654
06:28:55,220 --> 06:28:57,220
The gate

5655
06:29:00,100 --> 06:29:05,220
There's nothing oh, he just jumped on I saw that I thought I saw that

5656
06:29:07,700 --> 06:29:09,700
Oh

5657
06:29:12,580 --> 06:29:16,500
Okay, okay, okay, we're getting taller than a smoke ball

5658
06:29:17,460 --> 06:29:20,420
What's that banana freedom uh five three

5659
06:29:24,900 --> 06:29:26,900
I've not played assassin for the origin

5660
06:29:29,540 --> 06:29:34,500
You're like me also have issues wearing clothes. It's just no fun me. Okay, something's a fun

5661
06:29:37,300 --> 06:29:39,300
Mmm

5662
06:29:39,380 --> 06:29:41,860
I just put I just pushed that man in the water and he drowned

5663
06:29:42,180 --> 06:29:46,500
I will say one thing though, if you're a gondola pusher and you don't know how to swim

5664
06:29:46,820 --> 06:29:50,660
Isn't that a bit dangerous? Isn't that a bit silly?

5665
06:29:53,940 --> 06:29:55,780
I don't even realize I was supposed to be up here

5666
06:29:59,540 --> 06:30:05,300
Whoa, wait, why can't he see me? I thought we purposely put these beams here so you can't get seen by the guards below

5667
06:30:06,180 --> 06:30:08,180
Oh

5668
06:30:09,780 --> 06:30:12,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa my part in my bag

5669
06:30:14,900 --> 06:30:18,580
I'm gonna do that just so you know, where is it? Oh

5670
06:30:20,980 --> 06:30:27,540
Pitching wasn't the problem is that you touched the boat. Oh, I can't believe it finding Nemo. I touched the boat

5671
06:30:31,780 --> 06:30:33,780
How many slower me

5672
06:30:36,020 --> 06:30:38,020
Oh

5673
06:30:57,540 --> 06:31:01,060
The freaking twat from across the street saw me

5674
06:31:01,380 --> 06:31:03,380
Hey

5675
06:31:03,700 --> 06:31:05,700
Yeah, you do that on the way again

5676
06:31:06,420 --> 06:31:09,300
You'd be surprised I was in the Navy and only passed the swim test because

5677
06:31:11,700 --> 06:31:13,700
Proctor wanted me to go home. Jeez

5678
06:31:16,660 --> 06:31:18,660
And

5679
06:31:18,980 --> 06:31:22,580
I think if you're Scottish you have to learn to swim like you're forced to go to swimming

5680
06:31:24,180 --> 06:31:29,700
Yeah, let's just run ahead of this guard because he can't see me at the corner of his eye, but I get out of range

5681
06:31:30,180 --> 06:31:32,180
Which is good

5682
06:31:33,140 --> 06:31:35,140
Gondola logging

5683
06:31:35,460 --> 06:31:37,460
I've only got five poisons

5684
06:31:38,580 --> 06:31:40,580
It probably just

5685
06:31:40,820 --> 06:31:44,500
Man, I've got 19 crossbow bolts. They're quiet. I don't get

5686
06:31:46,900 --> 06:31:48,900
So it's all good

5687
06:31:51,860 --> 06:31:53,860
Uh, right

5688
06:31:56,100 --> 06:31:58,100
That's fine

5689
06:31:58,420 --> 06:32:00,420
It's fine. That's fine. So who

5690
06:32:07,140 --> 06:32:11,060
Okay, so this time the freaking guy doesn't notice me. Yeah, that's what I thought me

5691
06:32:17,060 --> 06:32:20,340
Doesn't even spot me this time sting

5692
06:32:29,060 --> 06:32:31,060
We'll set the stall and we go

5693
06:32:34,900 --> 06:32:36,900
Oh, I need to go up

5694
06:32:42,340 --> 06:32:48,180
Uh, so you're gonna see me he is so I kind of need to deal with you. Sorry if you're in my way son

5695
06:32:49,220 --> 06:32:52,820
You're in my way. You're in my way. You're in my way. You're in my way

5696
06:32:53,220 --> 06:32:55,220
We

5697
06:33:05,300 --> 06:33:07,300
Oh

5698
06:33:07,300 --> 06:33:10,340
Poison him just to get around the corner successfully

5699
06:33:11,220 --> 06:33:15,300
The bluetooth device is uh, why did you not go up?

5700
06:33:16,740 --> 06:33:18,740
Go up

5701
06:33:18,740 --> 06:33:20,740
Oh another there we go

5702
06:33:23,140 --> 06:33:29,300
How's your gaming going? Uh, we mlg gamers out here. Um, unfortunately

5703
06:33:31,300 --> 06:33:39,620
I believe the 100% will not happen this stream it I did not I did not anticipate

5704
06:33:41,140 --> 06:33:43,140
How hard this game is

5705
06:33:43,300 --> 06:33:46,260
Because I've never attempted it before like I genuinely don't know how it goes

5706
06:33:47,140 --> 06:33:49,540
Um, right. I'm gonna poison him and the other

5707
06:33:49,780 --> 06:33:53,860
Oh, hey, where where where

5708
06:33:57,940 --> 06:34:01,540
I almost deseed but I think I hit a checkpoint

5709
06:34:04,100 --> 06:34:06,100
I don't

5710
06:34:07,140 --> 06:34:09,140
I got so now I'm gonna just go in

5711
06:34:11,060 --> 06:34:15,620
I don't even know how you saw me. I'm up here. They're not supposed to be able to see you from up here

5712
06:34:15,620 --> 06:34:24,100
Yeah, like that guy really there's like more cool. Oh that

5713
06:34:26,260 --> 06:34:28,260
Get me in the war. No

5714
06:34:38,100 --> 06:34:40,100
I like that

5715
06:34:40,100 --> 06:34:42,100
Oh

5716
06:34:42,100 --> 06:34:44,100
Okay, that's pretty good detail

5717
06:34:44,580 --> 06:34:46,580
No, no

5718
06:34:48,180 --> 06:34:54,260
It feels literally drowning right now. He needs to catch a breath of freaking air because I keep making him go under

5719
06:34:56,500 --> 06:34:58,500
Oh, goodness me. I don't think we make a

5720
06:35:00,660 --> 06:35:03,940
Oh goodness me. They're not making this one easy, aren't they?

5721
06:35:03,940 --> 06:35:05,940
Oh

5722
06:35:10,980 --> 06:35:12,180
Oh

5723
06:35:12,180 --> 06:35:18,500
He took a sword out. I heard it, but he needs to breathe or else he pops up for too long. He needs to breathe

5724
06:35:20,340 --> 06:35:24,100
I need to breathe just thinking about how long he's holding his breath honestly. Um

5725
06:35:25,300 --> 06:35:28,900
Please don't do the animation where you can't breathe. Please

5726
06:35:30,500 --> 06:35:32,500
Oh, we did it

5727
06:35:34,020 --> 06:35:36,020
Oh for goodness sake, there's more

5728
06:35:42,820 --> 06:35:44,820
Breathe

5729
06:35:49,620 --> 06:35:51,060
One

5730
06:35:51,060 --> 06:35:52,820
two

5731
06:35:52,820 --> 06:35:54,420
Reeve

5732
06:35:54,420 --> 06:35:55,460
One

5733
06:35:55,460 --> 06:36:02,980
Okay, I think maybe I can kill those ones because that was really rough, right? So that was too much bright olden

5734
06:36:04,020 --> 06:36:06,020
Any breathers in chat we stay driven

5735
06:36:08,740 --> 06:36:12,340
I'm going to scotland into the whoa. Wait, how far back are we?

5736
06:36:16,180 --> 06:36:18,180
Huh

5737
06:36:18,180 --> 06:36:20,180
That's pretty far back

5738
06:36:23,940 --> 06:36:25,940
Okay, like I did here

5739
06:36:26,660 --> 06:36:33,220
Oh, I've just wasted so much time dropping myself back here by here. I'm breathing is overrated honestly

5740
06:36:34,420 --> 06:36:36,420
I

5741
06:36:38,020 --> 06:36:40,420
Know the game's telling me to swim under this but like

5742
06:36:41,140 --> 06:36:48,980
So much freaking time like that guy is going so fast and as we gondola like he knows that I'm literally trying to swim behind him in time

5743
06:36:49,780 --> 06:36:51,780
he's such a lot like

5744
06:36:52,260 --> 06:36:55,140
You know, I'm freaking behind you. Slow it down

5745
06:36:57,300 --> 06:37:00,340
Literally, I'm trying to like silently swim is not even possible

5746
06:37:04,820 --> 06:37:11,140
I think if I just hang off the pier and assassinate him, this is the best way forward for this

5747
06:37:12,500 --> 06:37:14,500
Sorry mate, but time's up

5748
06:37:16,500 --> 06:37:20,820
Okay, yeah, that's far more easier. I just need to do it to the other guy on the pier. Sorry

5749
06:37:24,740 --> 06:37:29,620
Oxygen addicts honestly can't get enough of it. You're so greedy, huh?

5750
06:37:34,900 --> 06:37:36,900
Okay, let's die

5751
06:37:38,900 --> 06:37:44,500
And then breathe and then die and then breathe and then yank

5752
06:37:46,420 --> 06:37:52,020
Ezio, please do not go on the platform when it comes to assassinating freaking gods

5753
06:37:54,180 --> 06:37:55,780
Ezio

5754
06:37:55,780 --> 06:38:00,500
You knew fine. Well, I was asking you to pull him into the water

5755
06:38:01,460 --> 06:38:03,700
Not get on the platform

5756
06:38:04,340 --> 06:38:09,780
Where the freaking AI is so sensitive and on the lookout on freaking

5757
06:38:11,220 --> 06:38:15,860
You freaking freaks, right? I'm just a sir air assassinating spam. Honestly

5758
06:38:16,820 --> 06:38:18,820
Game knows. Oh and he's gonna

5759
06:38:18,820 --> 06:38:20,820
He's gonna

5760
06:38:28,660 --> 06:38:32,500
And I'm out of honey tea and I'm sad that I can't have a freaking honey to

5761
06:38:33,780 --> 06:38:35,780
Gonna have to go to the shops

5762
06:38:40,900 --> 06:38:46,420
Right, I can take my time to this segment. I've never been caught out of here. So let's not go caught in there

5763
06:38:46,740 --> 06:38:47,860
Um

5764
06:38:47,860 --> 06:38:49,860
We swimming

5765
06:38:49,860 --> 06:38:52,580
Any swimmers you got any swimmers for me? I don't know

5766

Shopping

5767
06:38:57,700 --> 06:39:00,340
I feel like if I fast swim I might alert him

5768
06:39:01,220 --> 06:39:03,220
Now if I am correct

5769
06:39:04,180 --> 06:39:09,220
What the problem was is I assassinated here. I need to hang off and then assassinate. Yeah

5770
06:39:10,020 --> 06:39:15,860
But you knew exactly what I wanted to achieve it. So so don't even look at me. Okay, right don't interact with the gondola

5771
06:39:17,140 --> 06:39:18,420
I

Nice choice

All right, let's

06:40:07,700 --> 06:40:09,700
Oh

5784
06:40:10,020 --> 06:40:14,260
My life flashed before my so I'm gonna say ropes. Hey, she's still alive

5785
06:40:14,980 --> 06:40:21,300
Especially not past that drunk. I don't know if you're drunk. I don't know how to. Oh, I was not supposed to be okay. Detections now permitted

5786
06:40:21,300 --> 06:40:23,300
That's all I want to see baby

5787
06:40:30,180 --> 06:40:35,540
Detections now permitted yee-haw time to perish boys

5788
06:40:37,940 --> 06:40:39,940
Ha

5789
06:40:40,260 --> 06:40:42,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you want some of this

5790
06:40:44,820 --> 06:40:47,780
Actually, I need just disarm guards and kill them with their own weapon

5791
06:40:48,900 --> 06:40:54,660
So let's do that. Oh, give me that sword, please. Thank you very much. And then drug

5792
06:40:55,380 --> 06:41:00,500
And we did that automatically drop object and then we're gonna do it again. Can I steal your weapon?

5793
06:41:02,580 --> 06:41:04,580
Oh, not fighting over the weapon

5794
06:41:04,980 --> 06:41:08,980
Okay, there we go. He wouldn't like over honestly. I wouldn't like all my wife into if I had one

5795
06:41:09,300 --> 06:41:11,780
Now I'm chilling cleaning up and watching because I love easy to do

5796
06:41:13,140 --> 06:41:18,100
Azura said she watched like she played it as well. And me said she got it as gifted, but she never played it

5797
06:41:20,420 --> 06:41:22,260
So

5798
06:41:22,260 --> 06:41:24,760
Good night those who rest. Thank you for hanging

5799
06:41:29,060 --> 06:41:31,940
I love when I can be detected. It's so fun

5800
06:41:34,740 --> 06:41:36,740
Come on who wants to first then

5801
06:41:39,860 --> 06:41:43,700
Okay, there you go. Oh, no, don't grab me who wants to first you

5802
06:41:49,700 --> 06:41:53,540
Take that and this and you're another one

5803
06:41:54,180 --> 06:41:59,940
Oh, I love the crisscross kill is so cool. Oh wait, I'm actually gonna look because those were pretty high

5804
06:42:00,980 --> 06:42:02,980
guard

5805
06:42:03,540 --> 06:42:05,540
Oh

5806
06:42:07,060 --> 06:42:10,260
These guys act like they understand you're the main character on a little

5807
06:42:16,740 --> 06:42:22,100
Uh, okay, I thought I got more poison holdings

5808
06:42:33,940 --> 06:42:41,300
Uh, once we've done other Leonardo missions, I think we'll do all of the factions because I want to dress up my assassin's creed gild

5809
06:42:42,180 --> 06:42:44,180
gild

5810
06:42:44,180 --> 06:42:46,180
So it's girly pop, you know what I'm saying

5811
06:42:48,660 --> 06:42:50,660
How'd I get up there? Or did I just leap?

5812
06:42:51,620 --> 06:42:56,020
Did I do a leap? Oh, that was a big leap. It's so on the side. I don't think you should have been able to do that

5813
06:42:56,020 --> 06:42:58,020
But hey, ho

5814
06:42:58,900 --> 06:43:02,420
You can't see me because you're dead by the time you process. It's me

5815
06:43:04,020 --> 06:43:06,020
Daddy's home

5816
06:43:06,740 --> 06:43:08,740
Let's look he may have poison on him

5817
06:43:11,380 --> 06:43:13,380
They accepted that they were dead

5818
06:43:20,020 --> 06:43:25,140
I'm gonna go see you in the morning. Oh, that's hilarious. What fuckers saying that now literally good night. See you in the morning

5819
06:43:25,140 --> 06:43:27,140
I'll still be online sweet dreams

5820
06:43:28,420 --> 06:43:32,340
Have a good rest. I'll still be here on assassin's creed on my knees

5821
06:43:36,020 --> 06:43:38,020
Drive home

5822
06:43:40,260 --> 06:43:42,260
They're more like guidelines than actual rules

5823
06:43:47,860 --> 06:43:49,860
Oh, I do love this game

5824
06:43:50,180 --> 06:43:52,180
So that's fine

5825
06:43:53,540 --> 06:43:57,140
That reason I did go watch and I get him out of it live

5826
06:44:00,420 --> 06:44:02,420
Oh

5827
06:44:04,420 --> 06:44:07,220
Let's see if you can fight your master's hand shall we oh

5828
06:44:08,660 --> 06:44:14,260
Oh, what's this? I don't whoa. Whoa. Whoa row. What switch?

5829
06:44:14,660 --> 06:44:16,660
Oh

5830
06:44:17,460 --> 06:44:23,860
Wow, I have to switch between rowing and and aiming. I mean, I guess I comprehend that but sheesh

5831
06:44:25,220 --> 06:44:27,220
Oh, we're taking down ships

5832
06:44:28,980 --> 06:44:33,540
Boo Templars stinky Templars, uh switch fire

5833
06:44:35,300 --> 06:44:40,420
Oh my gosh, that's so cool. Okay sales destroyed that makes sense

5834
06:44:44,500 --> 06:44:47,940
I only hit one of them there. I'm getting rigged right now

5835
06:44:49,940 --> 06:44:55,620
All done. Bye. Bye. Okay. Okay. I like it. I'm digging it. I'm digging it

5836
06:44:58,500 --> 06:45:01,300
Oh my gosh, they're like ragdolling off the ship

5837
06:45:04,260 --> 06:45:06,260
Okay, that was cool. I enjoyed that

5838
06:45:07,780 --> 06:45:11,540
Yo ho ho it's a pirate's life for me

5839
06:45:12,500 --> 06:45:20,100
A tweedily dum a tweedily dee tweedily weedily wee. I don't know the words. I just know the shiny. Oh, yo, yo

5840
06:45:25,460 --> 06:45:30,820
Okay, it looks like there's just three and I have plenty of health. So that's fine

5841
06:45:33,300 --> 06:45:36,660
Give me fuel in my fire give keep me burning

5842
06:45:37,620 --> 06:45:40,900
Put some oil in my land eye-free

5843
06:45:42,580 --> 06:45:45,060
Can I do it from here? Mmm, baby, just gonna clean that

5844
06:45:47,060 --> 06:45:49,700
Possibly can I do all three though?

5845
06:45:52,180 --> 06:45:59,460
I think I'm gonna have to row a bit closer to this one at the back here. I think that's it. That should be good

5846
06:46:01,540 --> 06:46:04,660
No, I didn't hit it. Oopsies

5847
06:46:07,540 --> 06:46:09,540
Oh

5848
06:46:23,620 --> 06:46:27,060
I don't think you can go back through so we're just gonna

5849
06:46:28,740 --> 06:46:30,740
Do a thing

5850
06:46:31,620 --> 06:46:35,060
You're now notorious guards are on high alert. I should hope so

5851
06:46:35,940 --> 06:46:40,980
Because I'm still here me it's you. Oh, they knocked me off my my gun

5852
06:46:41,700 --> 06:46:45,620
I don't even know what you're doing. Hold on lads. I need to rotate before I destroy his

5853
06:46:46,580 --> 06:46:48,420
Do give me a second

5854
06:46:48,420 --> 06:46:52,180
You just need to rotate. I actually don't think I can hit it from this distance. You know that

5855
06:46:52,660 --> 06:46:54,340
Ow, I'm

5856
06:46:54,340 --> 06:46:56,340
Wait, whoa, what's happening?

5857
06:46:57,060 --> 06:47:02,020
Okay, hold on. Hold on. We need to like do a big old circle around because

5858
06:47:03,620 --> 06:47:08,020
That I'm like too close to even hit this stuff

5859
06:47:11,940 --> 06:47:14,420
Honestly black flag for all take for real

5860
06:47:19,860 --> 06:47:24,180
Going reverse so so can you go backwards? I don't even know if I can

5861
06:47:25,140 --> 06:47:27,460
I don't try it. We're just in the old spin around

5862
06:47:29,700 --> 06:47:31,700
Did that hit I hope so

5863
06:47:34,260 --> 06:47:37,540
Almost there we go beautiful beautiful

5864
06:47:39,220 --> 06:47:43,140
And last but not least let's not get too close now. Let's not get too close

5865
06:47:44,900 --> 06:47:46,900
Still got some momentum

5866
06:47:47,380 --> 06:47:49,380
Oh

5867
06:47:49,700 --> 06:47:54,900
One more rule should do it get us front row seats to this pirate ship going down

5868
06:47:59,620 --> 06:48:01,700
Oh, they're hurting me they're hurting me

5869
06:48:05,460 --> 06:48:07,460
Just a range hold on

5870
06:48:10,020 --> 06:48:13,780
I'm like just there no more. Oh you guys are hurting me

5871
06:48:14,740 --> 06:48:16,740
You're giving me a booboo

5872
06:48:19,060 --> 06:48:22,100
Just just a range that was so close

5873
06:48:22,740 --> 06:48:24,740
Right a little bit of a push

5874
06:48:24,740 --> 06:48:27,620
I just don't want to get too close to the point where I can't even freaking aim

5875
06:48:29,620 --> 06:48:31,620
There we go we got there we got them

5876
06:48:33,140 --> 06:48:38,740
It literally is your tank in all the arrows. Okay, that was kind of for me. Take the way they are jumped off the ship

5877
06:48:44,740 --> 06:48:48,180
However, they don't want you on you. Honestly, there's literally cannonballs

5878
06:48:49,780 --> 06:48:54,260
Literally be a BRB. Sorry. I can't aim at your shills. Let me just do a little spin around. Oh

5879
06:48:56,820 --> 06:48:58,820
Oh, we're shooting at ourselves

5880
06:49:02,900 --> 06:49:04,900
Wow

5881
06:49:05,140 --> 06:49:07,140
Oh

5882
06:49:14,180 --> 06:49:16,180
We actually go 100 sink for that. Okay

5883
06:49:19,780 --> 06:49:25,860
I used to love this game then you have fantastic taste because this is my number one game of all time and I suck at it

5884
06:49:28,900 --> 06:49:30,260
New

5885
06:49:30,260 --> 06:49:35,700
Right, hold on. Is there one more Leonardo mission? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay

5886
06:49:37,700 --> 06:49:41,780
Uh, how are they always on the opposite place?

5887
06:49:48,500 --> 06:49:54,420
Right, we're finished this Leonardo and then we'll get the gales faction

5888
06:49:54,900 --> 06:49:56,900
In

5889
06:49:58,500 --> 06:50:00,980
Tank tank tank you are good at sucking

5890
06:50:13,220 --> 06:50:17,300
Sorry, I'm making an animated shot of your reference sheet for the meme tag

5891
06:50:18,580 --> 06:50:20,660
Should I uh bring in the tweet?

5892
06:50:21,220 --> 06:50:23,220
Um

5893
06:50:23,860 --> 06:50:28,820
I don't know if when it comes to memification of something you don't have to credit the original rs

5894
06:50:28,900 --> 06:50:32,020
I don't know. What do you guys think you're probably better know than me like

5895
06:50:33,140 --> 06:50:35,620
I did credit her like right under the

5896
06:50:36,260 --> 06:50:42,100
Thingy so like people know it is by her under the reference sheet like at all times. I don't know

5897
06:50:44,660 --> 06:50:46,660
These hay bales were soaking

5898
06:50:46,980 --> 06:50:48,980
So

5899
06:50:50,500 --> 06:50:56,420
One of the games are the most uh called dynasty warriors ac brotherhood was the last game I truly played in the series

5900
06:50:57,220 --> 06:50:59,620
Yeah, revelations was all right

5901
06:51:00,500 --> 06:51:02,500
but

5902
06:51:02,820 --> 06:51:04,820
It wasn't brotherhood

5903
06:51:06,900 --> 06:51:12,020
If I had to rank them it's brotherhood then ac2 and then revelations for exo storyline

5904
06:51:12,980 --> 06:51:19,860
I went on an adventure trying to beat up all oh to beat all of this asca games, but I stopped at syndica. Hmm

5905
06:51:21,540 --> 06:51:25,620
I think I've played assassins creed three maybe unironically three times. Um

5906
06:51:27,620 --> 06:51:29,620
It's just no fun

5907
06:51:34,180 --> 06:51:37,940
ACR had uh fucking turret defense literally the turret defense

5908
06:51:38,900 --> 06:51:43,700
Do slash credit. Yeah, maybe do slash credit just so it's not like

5909
06:51:44,420 --> 06:51:47,220
Bothering but the credit is there for people who do want to

5910
06:51:49,700 --> 06:51:52,900
Yeah, people say they love black flag I struggled so much to get into it

5911
06:51:52,900 --> 06:51:58,100
But I'm wondering if it's just because I'm like a little cry baby because ac wasn't like in the series anymore

5912
06:51:59,860 --> 06:52:05,300
Which is very plausible. I wouldn't I wouldn't mind to try and get black flag one more big hood. Uh

5913
06:52:05,940 --> 06:52:07,940
Um

5914
06:52:08,980 --> 06:52:10,420
But I just

5915
06:52:10,420 --> 06:52:15,940
Really seem to struggle with the controls, but it's probably because I'm doing the well

5916
06:52:15,940 --> 06:52:21,060
I've already played assassins creed. So I don't need to sit and read the controls. Well, obviously they have changed the controls

5917
06:52:22,580 --> 06:52:24,580
So

5918
06:52:24,740 --> 06:52:26,740
I'm you've been a quiet boy, baby

5919
06:52:30,100 --> 06:52:32,260
Valhalla

5920
06:52:32,260 --> 06:52:35,860
I wish they would make more like story multiplayer games like

5921
06:52:37,220 --> 06:52:39,140
It takes two

5922
06:52:39,140 --> 06:52:41,460
It's like such a good story thing

5923
06:52:41,780 --> 06:52:46,900
And I would absolutely love to play games like that on stream and be like, okay after the first chapter

5924
06:52:46,980 --> 06:52:52,820
We'll get someone else in okay next chapter. We'll like get someone else in but like they just don't need to do that. They just don't need to do that

5925
06:52:54,740 --> 06:52:56,340
It's annoying

5926
06:52:56,340 --> 06:52:58,340
So annoying

5927
06:52:59,140 --> 06:53:01,540
I can't believe I can't play video games the exact same

5928
06:53:02,500 --> 06:53:04,500
Exactly the way I want to play them

5929
06:53:05,700 --> 06:53:07,700
It's such a baby

5930
06:53:10,980 --> 06:53:14,820
Kill the template overseer to recover map use the pistol a

5931
06:53:18,020 --> 06:53:20,020
I can do that

5932
06:53:28,900 --> 06:53:30,900
Oh

5933
06:53:32,420 --> 06:53:36,660
No, yes, no, yes

5934
06:53:42,100 --> 06:53:48,180
Yeah, I was gonna see you sure you want to fake this. Oh wow, it's always you guys that want to fake stop this

5935
06:53:49,940 --> 06:53:54,740
Hawkins and not really I'll see if I can loot a smoke bomb back

5936
06:53:58,500 --> 06:54:01,780
I've been having a blast watching a veteran in a newcomer play the hero

5937
06:54:03,540 --> 06:54:06,180
That oh, yeah, the halo campaign is gonna be playable

5938
06:54:16,420 --> 06:54:18,900
Okay, last one question mark, I think

5939
06:54:19,860 --> 06:54:21,860
You

5940
06:54:24,340 --> 06:54:26,340
That's the other mission

5941
06:54:26,980 --> 06:54:28,980
Halo 3 plugin

5942
06:54:30,340 --> 06:54:32,980
Is it like safe to do a halo campaign?

5943
06:54:34,580 --> 06:54:38,340
That would be really cool to do a refling. It's not gonna lie. I'd be pretty hyped for that

5944
06:54:38,580 --> 06:54:40,580
But I don't know how safe it is to like add people

5945
06:54:41,860 --> 06:54:44,260
Because I don't think I can just instance and have you guys in

5946
06:54:45,140 --> 06:54:51,220
It would be pretty pretty cool to like I don't is it joe only or is it four man?

5947
06:54:54,420 --> 06:54:59,140
Favorite game combat of bill is it evolved or yeah or evolution

5948
06:55:03,140 --> 06:55:05,540
Oh my gosh, it's john halo from fortnight

5949
06:55:07,140 --> 06:55:12,260
Lean out his tank is an ambitious and devastating war machine capable do not take any damage well in the tank

5950
06:55:12,260 --> 06:55:14,260
Yeah, good luck for that. We're not in the fun

5951
06:55:25,620 --> 06:55:28,500
Have name poison which is decent

5952
06:55:42,980 --> 06:55:48,260
Yeah, we're not doing that. Um, literally everyone's getting poisoned. I don't care

5953
06:55:52,180 --> 06:55:55,220
We have name the wash to bought some more at a healer

5954
06:56:00,180 --> 06:56:03,780
Yeah, maybe if it's safe to add people like on halo then

5955
06:56:04,660 --> 06:56:07,940
You could do playthroughs of that, but I guess you

5956
06:56:08,740 --> 06:56:12,980
We could only do a mission by mission. So like we would do one mission and then

5957
06:56:14,020 --> 06:56:16,260
Kick out and then add and then next mission

5958
06:56:18,100 --> 06:56:20,100
You know

5959
06:56:22,420 --> 06:56:24,420
We see nothing

5960
06:56:27,300 --> 06:56:32,340
How did you guys not sure it's a poison dart so it's supposed to just be like a little swing

5961
06:56:33,300 --> 06:56:35,060
And no one knows

5962
06:56:35,060 --> 06:56:40,740
Literally poison is so peefer like when it comes to don't be detected because you can walk right in front of them and

5963
06:56:41,380 --> 06:56:43,380
Obviously the crossbow does the exact same thing

5964
06:56:45,140 --> 06:56:47,140
Yeah, poison's cool

5965
06:56:47,300 --> 06:56:49,300
Oops. Sorry. Sorry. Oh

5966
06:56:49,540 --> 06:56:53,700
I was pulling down my sleeves. I'm getting uh, that's right. I'm wearing a hoodie

5967
06:56:54,820 --> 06:56:56,820
You'll never guess why

5968
06:56:57,780 --> 06:56:59,780
Wait, how am I supposed to get

5969
06:57:02,660 --> 06:57:04,660
I

5970
06:57:07,380 --> 06:57:11,460
Love how as soon as you go sideways, they just don't care anymore. They're like and

5971
06:57:20,100 --> 06:57:22,100
Beat up the architect. Oh, okay

5972
06:57:26,180 --> 06:57:28,180
Hello

5973
06:57:33,300 --> 06:57:38,900
What are the plans for the weapon? You're so aggressive. I feel like goodness. You just ask before beating up

5974
06:57:39,220 --> 06:57:40,740
I am not sure

5975
06:57:40,740 --> 06:57:46,340
But you need three people to work. Come with me. They know we we captioned three soldiers

5976
06:57:47,060 --> 06:57:51,940
They're in a cell across from the plans. We will help you. We're helping people. Yeah

5977
06:57:53,620 --> 06:57:55,620
Go home

5978
06:57:56,660 --> 06:58:00,020
Uh checkpoint reached amala to be seen yet

5979
06:58:02,980 --> 06:58:04,980
No

5980
06:58:10,180 --> 06:58:12,180
This music so dramatic

5981
06:58:14,340 --> 06:58:16,340
You can go first

5982
06:58:17,060 --> 06:58:19,540
Sucks to suck. Sorry, but if I'm gonna have to bear

5983
06:58:21,300 --> 06:58:24,980
Uh, we could do two poisons here just to be doubly sure

5984
06:58:24,980 --> 06:58:26,980
Uh

5985
06:58:28,580 --> 06:58:32,580
Oh, it probably does. Can you know I really

5986
06:58:34,180 --> 06:58:36,180
Oh my god, that alert him. No

5987
06:58:37,620 --> 06:58:39,620
I need this guy to pair

5988
06:58:39,860 --> 06:58:43,220
Stop hurting and then in order to unsheathe my

5989
06:58:46,900 --> 06:58:48,900
Right, you're next

5990
06:58:49,460 --> 06:58:54,180
You're freaking next now that I can see you. Jeez. There's such a pain in my butt

5991
06:58:55,220 --> 06:58:57,220
Not the good kind

5992
06:58:57,460 --> 06:58:59,460
You're next

5993
06:58:59,940 --> 06:59:03,780
You're all done and everyone's perished and my ankles are sore, but

5994
06:59:04,420 --> 06:59:06,420
Here we did it

5995
06:59:08,580 --> 06:59:14,660
First thing I checked was she's still screaming for me to do it. No, I would have gone the 14 hours, but it didn't work

5996
06:59:17,300 --> 06:59:20,580
Three of the mercenaries can I still be can't be spot?

5997
06:59:20,580 --> 06:59:22,580
Which

5998
06:59:24,100 --> 06:59:26,100

06:59:27,780 --> 06:59:29,780
So anyone even here

6000
06:59:30,980 --> 06:59:39,060
Doesn't look like it. Hi mercenaries. Hello. Where is Dabin? She's machine. Follow us. They have hidden the path, but we discovered the entrance

6001
06:59:40,820 --> 06:59:42,820
Do you come lads

6002
06:59:44,420 --> 06:59:46,420
Eh three mercenaries. Oh not two

6003
06:59:46,660 --> 06:59:53,380
Follow and protect them. Uh, well, maybe if they didn't jump right in front of the enemies, then sure

6004
06:59:54,660 --> 06:59:58,180
You frick wait, wait, wait, you're done fart. I'm farting

6005
06:59:58,980 --> 07:00:00,980
You're done

07:00:02,420 --> 07:00:04,420
Oh, it's good to see me

6007
07:00:05,860 --> 07:00:10,900
Hopefully they can actually fight a wee bit. No, why are you fighting one of them guys? There's

6008
07:00:11,460 --> 07:00:18,180
I've got them in the oh and yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Stop it

6009

6011
07:00:38,420 --> 07:00:44,100
Get him first get him first. No, you missed him. You were supposed to get the other card right right. We're farting again

6012
07:00:53,060 --> 07:00:55,060
Oh, I should have got that guy first actually

6013
07:00:56,660 --> 07:01:02,820
Oh, and he's right around the corner. I'm just attracted to the tent. Please just perish your one HP in a freaking dream

6014
07:01:03,380 --> 07:01:08,420
Uh, and it's not even registering my kicks lovely and that guy's getting beaten up by a brute

6015
07:01:10,420 --> 07:01:12,420
Yeah, they're done. Oh

6016
07:01:12,420 --> 07:01:14,660
Now looting time for another fart bomb because

6017
07:01:15,380 --> 07:01:18,340
We're needing them. I've got one. Okay. I actually got one needed

6018
07:01:23,060 --> 07:01:25,060
Yeah

6019
07:01:25,060 --> 07:01:29,060
For a surprise assault on sigilia, we will stop the attack

6020
07:01:39,700 --> 07:01:42,420
We need to open the gate. I will find a way

6021
07:01:43,860 --> 07:01:45,860
You guys hold still you just wait for me

6022
07:01:48,900 --> 07:01:51,300
A little bit parkour a little bit parkour momentum

6023
07:01:55,860 --> 07:02:02,980
Okay, there we go open for you open sesame

6024
07:02:10,340 --> 07:02:12,340
Did I just say open sesame

6025
07:02:17,940 --> 07:02:20,820
Remember that time I got asked about open sesame

6026
07:02:22,740 --> 07:02:24,740
And I said open cumin

6027
07:02:25,940 --> 07:02:27,940
Good

6028
07:02:46,260 --> 07:02:48,260
I don't know why my brain blank

6029
07:02:50,180 --> 07:02:52,180
I think it was the way the question was worded

6030
07:02:52,500 --> 07:02:56,580
The bridge can I lower the bridge? I guess

6031
07:03:01,940 --> 07:03:07,380
Open sesame or open cumin. I know which one sounds better than me

6032
07:03:12,980 --> 07:03:14,980
Uh

6033
07:03:15,940 --> 07:03:17,940
Oh

6034
07:03:25,220 --> 07:03:33,300
The way you record that literally my brain was like recalling memory memory loading memory loaded

6035
07:03:37,220 --> 07:03:39,220
It's open cinnamon

6036
07:03:40,020 --> 07:03:42,020
Whoa

6037
07:03:43,220 --> 07:03:45,220
Music

6038
07:03:50,100 --> 07:03:52,980
Oh my god, hello

6039
07:03:55,460 --> 07:03:59,060
Can I run people I must be able to run people where there's no way in heck

6040
07:04:01,140 --> 07:04:03,780
Oh my god, this is adorable

6041
07:04:04,580 --> 07:04:05,780
Oh

6042
07:04:05,780 --> 07:04:10,340
Yeah, POV come take that and this you stinky stinky pins and that

6043
07:04:13,620 --> 07:04:16,660
Oh, this is like so cool. Sorry. I love this POV

6044
07:04:18,500 --> 07:04:20,500
Oh, maybe not

6045
07:04:22,420 --> 07:04:24,420
I don't know what's behind

6046
07:04:24,740 --> 07:04:29,860
I assume that's what hurts me if I take damage. I don't know. Maybe I'm maybe a little hundred percent of it

6047
07:04:30,660 --> 07:04:32,820
Oh, that's unlucky. Oh well

6048
07:04:34,020 --> 07:04:39,940
Hmm. Oh, sorry. That's a lot easier to tell what's coming up. Okay. I'm sorry. I have to change camo angle

6049
07:04:41,540 --> 07:04:43,540
Uh, I apologize

6050
07:04:45,540 --> 07:04:52,660
After the hundred percent are you squiddin me right now? Oh, thank you for the tip. What did you see?

6051
07:04:55,620 --> 07:04:59,460
Ah, hold on. I'm destroying things wait, wait

6052
07:05:00,420 --> 07:05:02,420
Thank you for the tip tiny funny

6053
07:05:02,980 --> 07:05:09,780
Ah, why are you? There's no way someone is standing up to a tank. You have to be crazy to stand up to a tank

6054
07:05:11,540 --> 07:05:13,780
Do you did they even do damage?

6055
07:05:21,380 --> 07:05:22,740
Wow

6056
07:05:22,740 --> 07:05:24,740
Oh, so you can dodge

6057
07:05:25,620 --> 07:05:30,420
But let me pause because uh, I don't want to miss that don't know because I'm really dumb and I'm gonna forget

6058
07:05:30,820 --> 07:05:32,820
I don't want to forgo

6059
07:05:33,700 --> 07:05:35,700
No way. Okay

6060
07:05:35,940 --> 07:05:43,220

6062
07:05:50,340 --> 07:05:52,900
Oh, man, just tank that whole cannonball

6063
07:05:54,740 --> 07:05:57,140
I need help setting up alerts they barely work

6064
07:05:58,100 --> 07:06:04,500
It's a bit of a nightmare to instrument elements, but once you get it set up, you never have to change it again

6065
07:06:04,740 --> 07:06:06,740
And you can set up custom

6066
07:06:07,140 --> 07:06:09,140
things like if someone

6067
07:06:09,220 --> 07:06:15,940
Donated like 69 dollars for example, you can get it to do. Are we going in a battle dome? Yes. Yes

6068
07:06:16,660 --> 07:06:18,660
Oh my god tank battle dome

6069
07:06:20,740 --> 07:06:22,740

07:06:28,100 --> 07:06:32,180
Is oh my god, I love tank battle dome. This is amazing

6072
07:06:39,460 --> 07:06:44,180
More tank battle dome more tank battle dome. It should be a game mode or something

6073
07:06:45,940 --> 07:06:48,020
Let me in

6074
07:06:48,020 --> 07:06:50,020
Let me in

6075
07:06:50,020 --> 07:06:53,700
This is why I think of your factories take this capitalism

6076
07:06:53,700 --> 07:06:55,700
Um

6077
07:06:56,100 --> 07:06:58,100
Tanks tank battle dome

No, no, you're not allowed in the tank. You're not allowed in it tank battle dome tank battle dome

07:07:06,900 --> 07:07:10,500
Cylinder box tank battle dome tank battle dome

Tank the battle dome battle dome battle dome battle dome

6084
07:07:40,340 --> 07:07:42,900
Yeah, I don't know how I'm gonna feel sink that I'm not gonna lie

6085
07:07:43,540 --> 07:07:47,140
I ain't going there's no way I'm 100% we can try and layer

6086
07:07:47,860 --> 07:07:51,380
Streams, but uh, yeah, there's no shot. I'm doing it tonight

6087
07:07:52,820 --> 07:07:54,340
Arrivederci

6088
07:07:54,340 --> 07:07:56,340
Little tank

6089
07:07:56,580 --> 07:07:58,580
I wish I could keep you

6090
07:07:59,060 --> 07:08:02,580
I see we're surreal for that. That was fun. I like tank battle dome

6091
07:08:04,260 --> 07:08:06,260
Just don't take damage five head

6092
07:08:07,380 --> 07:08:12,900
Some of the ever played the game modded before me who mods it so I can't take damage sucking because there's no damage hits

6093
07:08:14,020 --> 07:08:16,020
runs

6094
07:08:16,340 --> 07:08:18,340
Some of the freaking

6095
07:08:18,900 --> 07:08:21,780
100% are a bit outrageous, honestly

6096
07:08:25,140 --> 07:08:28,660
Rest builders who have to go if you need to go sleepy. Bye. Bye

6097
07:08:29,300 --> 07:08:34,340
Stroney, I'm up for almost 36 hours. I'm gonna get some shy. How are you? Oh my god, that's dangerous

6098
07:08:34,420 --> 07:08:36,420
Definitely get some rest my goodness

6099
07:08:37,220 --> 07:08:39,540
And yes, we will have a wonderful stream

6100
07:08:40,340 --> 07:08:43,780
It's news I spread that all my inventions have been destroyed

6101
07:08:44,180 --> 07:08:46,980
The disarray allowed me to work on something just for you

6102
07:08:47,700 --> 07:08:53,140
What is this story underwear to drift slowly from any height? It is not as cumbersome as my flying machine

6103
07:08:53,540 --> 07:08:55,540
You can take it everywhere

6104
07:08:58,100 --> 07:09:02,180
Okay, I think I know what we do with that

6105
07:09:04,260 --> 07:09:07,700
I think I know what we do with it

6106
07:09:08,500 --> 07:09:10,500
Uh

6107
07:09:14,740 --> 07:09:20,900
99% sure I know what we do with it. Y'all don't mind if we go do it right now

6108
07:09:25,540 --> 07:09:32,260
That was Leonardo da Vinci, you're right. You're not wrong. You're right. Oh, maybe I could have gone off that surface. Oh well

6109
07:09:32,580 --> 07:09:34,580
Um

6110
07:09:36,100 --> 07:09:38,980
I think it's just one of the guild requirements

6111
07:09:40,180 --> 07:09:42,180
To use the parachute

6112
07:09:43,380 --> 07:09:47,940
Whoa. Oh, there's a bank actually. I'm gonna take my bank money out because it looks cool

6113
07:09:51,140 --> 07:09:53,140
I can find the bank

6114
07:09:54,180 --> 07:09:57,620
Good evening. Good afternoon, mr. Bankman

6115
07:09:58,660 --> 07:10:01,940
Can I have my landlord simulate? Whoa? Where the heck is this bank?

6116
07:10:02,580 --> 07:10:06,420
Oh, it's out. Can I have the landlord simulator part of this game?

6117
07:10:09,220 --> 07:10:13,620
Is he counting coins? Why is he leaning over like that? He looks so insidious like volume

6118
07:10:14,580 --> 07:10:16,580
My coins

6119
07:10:21,140 --> 07:10:24,100
12 never came so mean as we just went away lol

6120
07:10:24,660 --> 07:10:26,660
Oh

6121
07:10:29,540 --> 07:10:33,460
Hello bank. I was like one million. I want one zillion dollars

6122
07:10:35,220 --> 07:10:37,220
We're it we're it

6123
07:10:40,580 --> 07:10:42,580
Right next we're gonna do challenges

6124
07:10:44,500 --> 07:10:46,500
To get our guild

6125
07:10:48,420 --> 07:10:51,220
To play decoration to play room decoration

6126
07:10:51,220 --> 07:10:54,420
So I've done landlord simulator. We're now doing room decoration

6127
07:10:57,380 --> 07:11:00,740
Uh and then after that

6128
07:11:03,300 --> 07:11:10,100
I think we actually have done like the main we're gonna take some of the layouts of this place

6129
07:11:12,500 --> 07:11:17,620
He actually just gave you sheets to take it's it's his laundry. He's like here it's all for you, buddy

6130
07:11:18,340 --> 07:11:24,820
Why not jump with me and why not jump with me? That's such a smart. I wonder if he only says that line

6131
07:11:25,460 --> 07:11:27,460
If you jump here

6132
07:11:29,860 --> 07:11:34,500
Butcher, it's not a butcher. Why do you keep saying butcher? I don't know

6133
07:11:35,940 --> 07:11:37,940
They both begin with letter b

6134
07:11:38,420 --> 07:11:39,460
So

6135
07:11:39,460 --> 07:11:43,380
Yeah, maybe that's why instead of blacksmiths I say butcher

6136
07:11:48,340 --> 07:11:50,900
Up next animal crossing decorating rooms

6137
07:11:52,420 --> 07:11:54,420
I

6138
07:11:54,420 --> 07:11:57,220
Personally will never stream animal crossing

6139
07:11:58,500 --> 07:12:03,540
I don't know if I why what whoa, they boarded me out

6140
07:12:06,260 --> 07:12:07,860
Ah

6141
07:12:07,860 --> 07:12:09,540
bridge

6142
07:12:09,540 --> 07:12:13,300
Like I don't know if I can make uh animal crossing fun

6143
07:12:14,980 --> 07:12:16,420
like

6144
07:12:16,420 --> 07:12:18,020
Maybe it's um

6145
07:12:18,020 --> 07:12:21,220
I don't know. I couldn't make it fun. I don't mind watching other people play it

6146
07:12:21,220 --> 07:12:24,180
But me I'm like I ain't that creative to make it in our game

6147
07:12:26,420 --> 07:12:28,820
I love all the games that start with ac on full

6148
07:12:29,940 --> 07:12:33,060
Right, so I guess the only way to get back into the castle is this way from now on

6149
07:12:34,020 --> 07:12:36,660
Whoa, we have over a hundred thousand forums

6150
07:12:38,340 --> 07:12:39,700
Uh

6151
07:12:39,700 --> 07:12:41,700
Right I can

6152
07:12:42,180 --> 07:12:44,180
Can I walk through that gate? No

6153
07:12:45,140 --> 07:12:50,580
That would be too easy. I wonder actually probably post game. They should actually open that gate

6154
07:12:50,580 --> 07:12:52,980
I said what said because like chaseries no longer a thing

6155
07:12:55,940 --> 07:12:57,940
Yeah, okay, so I've got a dm

6156
07:12:58,900 --> 07:13:02,180
I'm getting nervous. I'm like, oh no, is there something wrong with my babies if I've got a dm

6157
07:13:05,780 --> 07:13:07,780
Everything is cute

6158
07:13:09,220 --> 07:13:12,900
Oh, we have the thumbnails for our first group collab

6159
07:13:14,900 --> 07:13:20,260
And that is what I knew how how interesting I'll let it be a mystery

6160
07:13:26,660 --> 07:13:29,300
Rest well those who have to go. Thank you for hanging

6161
07:13:30,660 --> 07:13:35,060
Uh mercy is going live and two minus

6162
07:13:35,780 --> 07:13:38,180
one hour and 45 for

6163
07:13:38,820 --> 07:13:39,860
of

6164
07:13:39,860 --> 07:13:42,980
How the heck did I get up? I've completely forgotten all over again

6165
07:13:44,340 --> 07:13:46,660
Just go straight up like that. I guess

6166
07:13:48,100 --> 07:13:52,500
I do have my assassins. I suppose I can just signal them to go get rid of them

6167
07:13:53,620 --> 07:13:55,620
Yeah

6168
07:13:57,140 --> 07:13:59,140
Wait, wasn't there

6169
07:14:01,140 --> 07:14:03,140
This way over here

6170
07:14:03,620 --> 07:14:05,620
Do me sick

6171
07:14:05,780 --> 07:14:06,580
Uh

6172
07:14:06,580 --> 07:14:08,580
Relax hen

6173
07:14:08,740 --> 07:14:12,580
Why are you moaning about the place my goodness gonna alert the guards?

6174
07:14:14,500 --> 07:14:20,900
Good night. Sleep well those who need to sleep. Good morning. Those who are good morning

6175
07:14:26,500 --> 07:14:29,940
We should get me acting up a little I don't know what that was

6176
07:14:36,500 --> 07:14:38,500
Okay, this is what I was on

6177
07:14:39,380 --> 07:14:41,380
Let's do you

6178
07:14:41,860 --> 07:14:46,740
No, that guy actually can see you here if you get really unlucky, but you know

6179
07:14:47,940 --> 07:14:50,340
Morning, then uh, Europe's waking up

6180
07:14:52,340 --> 07:14:54,340
Whoop whoop you're coming to Europe

6181
07:14:56,180 --> 07:14:59,620
Okay, yeah, okay, the assassin signals being able to that is like

6182
07:15:11,540 --> 07:15:15,860
It's 3 a.m. In Europe. Oh, I'm a bit early for european streamers. I'll pull it out

6183
07:15:18,260 --> 07:15:22,020
Can I not go up there if I go up at the next one? I don't want to walk and go too far

6184
07:15:22,980 --> 07:15:24,980
Okay, it's the next one I go up

6185
07:15:25,700 --> 07:15:27,700
I need to go down in order to go up

6186
07:15:30,580 --> 07:15:32,580
Europeans perishing right now trying to

6187
07:15:34,500 --> 07:15:37,220
Wait, I'm losing it

6188
07:15:37,620 --> 07:15:42,740
Yeah, go down to go up. Okay, I'm starting to kind of remember but

6189
07:15:45,060 --> 07:15:47,060
So I was three a.m. somewhere

6190
07:15:50,900 --> 07:15:52,900
Last and ESP

6191
07:15:53,620 --> 07:15:57,220
I have no idea what time zone I'm like perfect for

6192
07:15:59,060 --> 07:16:05,540
But then again, am I technically not perfect for all time zones if I stream really long, huh?

6193
07:16:07,220 --> 07:16:09,220
Yeah

6194
07:16:12,340 --> 07:16:16,180
I don't think we're doing a 12 hours before anyone is strapped in

6195
07:16:18,660 --> 07:16:23,380
So some people will be relieved to hear that we're not doing another 12 hours at the spotting home

6196
07:16:24,020 --> 07:16:29,300
Uh, I think when we do Eldon ring it will be a few back-to-back 12 hours

6197
07:16:32,020 --> 07:16:34,020
Yeah, you fit all time zones, huh

6198
07:16:37,620 --> 07:16:39,620
If I had a healthy sleep

6199
07:16:40,180 --> 07:16:42,180
You'd be perfect for New Zealand

6200
07:16:43,460 --> 07:16:47,300
I thought it was 4 a.m. I was sorry. I didn't have my wife. No

6201
07:16:48,340 --> 07:16:52,260
Sorry, I'm not paying attention. I'm Jerry chat. Why have you got your

6202
07:16:53,300 --> 07:16:56,100
Put away the thing all my things glitched out. It's like

6203
07:16:56,900 --> 07:16:58,900
What are you doing? It's yeah

6204
07:17:00,180 --> 07:17:02,180
Oh, that was kind of badass

6205
07:17:02,500 --> 07:17:04,500
You know

6206
07:17:05,300 --> 07:17:13,700
Something's not add not pure that was that was no my assassin. What are you doing lady?

6207
07:17:15,540 --> 07:17:20,500
Classic woman moment can't make up her mind. That's terrible. Don't don't make yourself

6208
07:17:22,180 --> 07:17:24,180
Don't do that. That's my name

6209
07:17:29,300 --> 07:17:31,300
He is too gay

6210
07:17:33,060 --> 07:17:35,060
Oh

6211
07:17:40,660 --> 07:17:43,700
We're doing it. We're doing the thing

6212
07:17:47,460 --> 07:17:49,460
Oh

6213
07:17:49,940 --> 07:17:55,380
What was on the wrong side my sassen still haven't despawned they're freaking out. I don't like it

6214
07:17:57,060 --> 07:17:59,060
Ray

6215
07:17:59,300 --> 07:18:03,540
So I don't mess this up. How do I tell the parachute to come out?

6216
07:18:09,060 --> 07:18:12,820
Uh, I'm being papaga. How do I tell the parachute to come out?

6217
07:18:15,780 --> 07:18:17,780
Dad just launch and press x

6218
07:18:20,100 --> 07:18:25,700
Right, I don't I don't want to go that way because that won't activate the jump

6219
07:18:26,660 --> 07:18:33,860
Yeah, they the assassins are really struggling should prompt do a flip. Okay

6220
07:18:35,380 --> 07:18:37,380
What we did go to go that way

6221
07:18:40,740 --> 07:18:42,580
No point in going in the back in the street

6222
07:18:45,300 --> 07:18:49,300
Uh, uh, whatever the prompt is bloody hope it comes up because

6223
07:18:50,660 --> 07:18:52,980
It is not on the wheel

6224
07:18:56,660 --> 07:19:03,780
Oh, there we go. Oh, thank god, right. I need to do like a ton of distance. I guess I'll just go over the war

6225
07:19:05,220 --> 07:19:07,700
I was really worried that prompt wasn't gonna come out

6226
07:19:10,820 --> 07:19:13,700
I think I need to glade like 500 meters

6227
07:19:19,540 --> 07:19:23,780
Uh, am I gonna make the glade?

6228
07:19:26,660 --> 07:19:28,660
Am I gonna make the glade? Hello

6229
07:19:30,660 --> 07:19:34,900
Oh, am I not gonna make it come on pop pop pop pop

6230
07:19:36,740 --> 07:19:40,260
No, I don't want to claim it again. Please pop. What was that supposed to do?

6231
07:19:44,420 --> 07:19:48,900
Why did that all pop? I was supposed something was supposed to pop there not the achievement

6232
07:19:51,860 --> 07:19:54,340
What was supposed to what did I do wrong?

6233
07:19:56,100 --> 07:19:58,100
I wasn't assassins

6234
07:19:59,860 --> 07:20:01,860
Was it thieves because they're agile?

6235
07:20:03,620 --> 07:20:16,340
Glade and a cumulative total of 500 meters. I'm not to turn at all

6236
07:20:18,900 --> 07:20:20,740
Okay

6237
07:20:20,740 --> 07:20:27,940
No, I hope you guys have the same patience for me because I need to do that all over again. I don't know

6238
07:20:29,700 --> 07:20:31,220
Cumulative

6239
07:20:31,220 --> 07:20:34,420
All right, I'll just do it again because I should pop then

6240
07:20:35,700 --> 07:20:39,380
Just do it multiple times. Yes, right. We're gonna zoom it because at least I know exactly where to go

6241
07:20:41,700 --> 07:20:43,700
Wait

6242
07:20:44,820 --> 07:20:46,820
You can do it cheeky from time

6243
07:20:47,780 --> 07:20:50,660
I thought you could do it in one jump for some reason

6244
07:21:02,980 --> 07:21:08,500
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach

6245
07:21:09,780 --> 07:21:11,780
If you're trying

6246
07:21:12,260 --> 07:21:14,260
Oh, I'm breaking free

6247
07:21:14,260 --> 07:21:17,460
I can't remember the rest of it

6248
07:21:25,460 --> 07:21:29,140
Does it still a parachute? Yeah, I have four more inventory

6249
07:21:29,860 --> 07:21:34,900
Ah, all the guards have been spawned. I can't believe it. I can't believe this castle is full of guards

6250
07:21:36,420 --> 07:21:38,420
Shorting behavior

6251
07:21:38,500 --> 07:21:43,540
Get out. Anyone wants you here? Oh, my ankles. I didn't take any fall damage. Okay

6252
07:21:45,060 --> 07:21:48,740
I love your sit. Yeah, you're like when I burst into scots. I'm with my wee accent

6253
07:21:51,780 --> 07:21:55,460
I should do a scottish song cover. I don't know what to do. I wanted to do an m&m one

6254
07:21:55,540 --> 07:21:58,180
But I was like, I don't know if it's like bordering on cringe

6255
07:22:00,100 --> 07:22:04,980
I was like, I don't know what m&m song I wanted to do. Well, what a fun effort all

6256
07:22:08,420 --> 07:22:10,420
I've got

6257
07:22:10,580 --> 07:22:15,220
You got any clue what's going on? Do you? No, you didn't. You've spawned. That's all right

6258
07:22:17,380 --> 07:22:19,780
You threw me. I don't know what one to do

6259
07:22:21,140 --> 07:22:24,500
I'm beginning to feel like a wee bit of a rap god

6260
07:22:26,820 --> 07:22:28,820
I don't know what I'm doing

6261
07:22:30,980 --> 07:22:35,540
Yes, who's back back back back again again

6262
07:22:36,500 --> 07:22:38,980
Strony's back back back

6263
07:22:39,700 --> 07:22:41,700
Tell a friend. Oh

6264
07:22:42,180 --> 07:22:44,580
Everyone report to the dance floor

6265
07:22:45,380 --> 07:22:50,260
It's your season to be butt squeezing. That made me snore. I'm so sorry

6266
07:22:53,620 --> 07:22:59,140
Touch my body. I mean, was it boy? Just touch my body. I mean girl. Just touch my body

6267
07:22:59,780 --> 07:23:04,020
Because this is the part where the rap breaks down. No one moves. No one makes a sound

6268
07:23:04,100 --> 07:23:06,500
I'm just mixing into a ton of different songs. I think

6269

6276
07:23:50,820 --> 07:23:54,980
The spaghetti on this shirt, bro, does vomit on a shirt mom spaghetti

6277
07:23:58,100 --> 07:24:00,100
I'm a jukebox

6278

Okay, now we need this as a carry, okay

6279
07:24:04,900 --> 07:24:09,860

6280
07:24:12,580 --> 07:24:14,580

6286
07:24:33,380 --> 07:24:35,380

07:25:15,060 --> 07:25:17,060
I can't believe it

6297
07:25:17,140 --> 07:25:21,220
That's it. Put the tunes on we're rapping in scots

6298
07:25:21,780 --> 07:25:24,180
Because how on earth was that not 500?

6299
07:25:24,180 --> 07:25:26,180
Accumulative meters

6300
07:25:26,980 --> 07:25:28,180

6301
07:25:28,180 --> 07:25:33,540

6307
07:26:00,500 --> 07:26:03,780
Well, it's not really spoilers because it would have to be discussed anyway

6308
07:26:04,100 --> 07:26:08,420
I really thought it would be fun to like have distracts made like make distracts on each other

6309
07:26:09,140 --> 07:26:11,140
like so obviously they'd be like

6310
07:26:11,700 --> 07:26:14,500
Strony cuttles can't even see your name right because your Scottish

6311
07:26:14,980 --> 07:26:16,260
You know miss

6312

6313
07:26:21,140 --> 07:26:24,020
This each other, but I think like a diss track on each other would be so funny

6314
07:26:24,260 --> 07:26:28,980
Like I know it's brain dead, but it's like, I don't know. I just find that content like funny like interact with each other in that

07:27:39,700 --> 07:27:41,700
That didn't even rain

6333
07:27:43,540 --> 07:27:48,980
I just don't know how like how do how do people think of it like you have to go right away and right? So

6334
07:27:52,180 --> 07:27:56,420
I was like that. I don't know if you've seen the meme where it's like you're deadly

Oh

6337
07:28:04,100 --> 07:28:09,380
Like that's how I would end up doing a distract because I feel so much pressure to like say something

6338
07:28:12,420 --> 07:28:14,420
That's like

6339
07:28:14,980 --> 07:28:16,980
It just doesn't make any sense like

6340
07:28:17,540 --> 07:28:23,140
I just don't know how people come up with like actually like, you know how epic rap battles is like so good like

6341
07:28:24,100 --> 07:28:27,460
Who's rap flows the dopest Marilyn Min roses

07:28:32,340 --> 07:28:33,620
um

6344
07:28:33,620 --> 07:28:39,700
Like that is so good. And I'm like, how do people who've neared that we can do epic rap battles vtuber style. Come on

6345
07:28:40,100 --> 07:28:42,100
I'll stop reading my mind literally though

6346
07:28:44,420 --> 07:28:46,420
Literally though

6347
07:28:46,580 --> 07:28:48,580
I said

6348
07:28:49,220 --> 07:28:50,260
Yeah

6349
07:28:50,260 --> 07:28:53,460
Yeah, they spend more times on the like get idea of

6350
07:28:56,180 --> 07:28:58,020
Maybe vtuber should do rap battles

6351
07:28:58,020 --> 07:29:01,780
But like the problem is I don't have any music or lyrical thing

6352
07:29:01,940 --> 07:29:05,540
So I would have to like go out and commission to do it and then I would need to grab vtubers

6353
07:29:05,540 --> 07:29:07,860
I'd be willing to like let us diss each other like

6354
07:29:08,980 --> 07:29:10,500
Oh

6355
07:29:10,500 --> 07:29:12,500

07:35:01,700 --> 07:35:06,820
Invade four times or something. I've already forgotten the other freaking thing I was supposed to do

6433
07:35:07,700 --> 07:35:10,500
One enemy stationed at guard post. Okay, we're actually gonna uh

6434
07:35:11,620 --> 07:35:18,260
Stations guard post we're actually gonna do that in a memory because there's a memory that enables that

6435
07:35:18,500 --> 07:35:20,500
Horses belonging to guards commandeered

6436
07:35:21,220 --> 07:35:23,220
Horses yoinked

6437
07:35:23,300 --> 07:35:25,300
Without killing

6438
07:35:26,020 --> 07:35:28,020
Um

6439
07:35:28,260 --> 07:35:32,260
Do you want me to screenshot and post them to the third? I just need to do the last one

6440
07:35:33,140 --> 07:35:35,540
Oh, I can screenshot. I don't even have to type it out

6441
07:35:36,260 --> 07:35:39,700
Can I screenshot it? Did that screenshot work? I don't even think I did

6442
07:35:40,500 --> 07:35:42,500
It did

6443
07:35:42,900 --> 07:35:44,900
Okay

6444
07:35:45,380 --> 07:35:51,860
Okay, that worked. Okay, I worked it worked. I am so smart. Yes m r t

6445
07:35:52,580 --> 07:35:54,580
Okay, let's see

6446
07:35:56,260 --> 07:36:01,060
Put that there so I don't miss any donations of someone tips

6447
07:36:02,020 --> 07:36:04,020
And then put the discord there

6448
07:36:04,980 --> 07:36:11,300
And now I can oh wait. No, I can't see it. Oh the screenshot makes it so tiny that I can't see it

6449
07:36:11,300 --> 07:36:13,300
I need to type it out right six

6450
07:36:13,460 --> 07:36:17,700
Six thieves lured. I did it for anyway. No, it's the picture

6451
07:36:17,860 --> 07:36:22,420
It's because if it's a picture I need to have like discord and small sprint uninterrupted sprint

6452
07:36:23,300 --> 07:36:25,300
four three hundred

6453
07:36:26,580 --> 07:36:29,940
21 leaps of faith. I need to 40 leaps of faith

6454
07:36:31,620 --> 07:36:33,620
So you don't really do leaps of faith anymore

6455
07:36:34,580 --> 07:36:42,420
Guards air assassinate from a beam guards air assassinated from a beam unless, but certainly not least

6456
07:36:43,940 --> 07:36:45,940
Jump from a horse to a beam

6457
07:36:46,500 --> 07:36:48,500
Jump from horse

6458
07:36:48,580 --> 07:36:52,500
To beam. Yeah, there's actually like so much horse related ones. This is surprising

6459
07:36:53,620 --> 07:36:55,620
Uh, I didn't actually expect

6460
07:36:58,020 --> 07:37:01,220
Oh, is there a just message me? Oh, we should see

6461
07:37:04,100 --> 07:37:06,100
Ah, okay

6462
07:37:06,900 --> 07:37:12,500
It's m r t. Oh my god. Oh the girls are posting in the not say for work section of the discord now look at it

6463
07:37:16,580 --> 07:37:20,980
I think it may be oh actually maybe my gifted artwork

6464
07:37:24,900 --> 07:37:27,860
It's m marty. Oh wait, I've just closed the discord. Oops

6465
07:37:28,420 --> 07:37:32,020
The discord actually holds everything that I need to in order to play the game. Look at dum dum

6466
07:37:33,780 --> 07:37:36,660
It's m marty. No, that's smarty

6467
07:37:39,380 --> 07:37:44,420
Wow, I can't believe it. I might unironically need a third monar for this kind of stuff

6468
07:37:46,180 --> 07:37:48,180
Okay

6469
07:37:53,300 --> 07:37:58,180
Someone at our ubisoft is really proud of the horses honestly probably took like a heckish

6470
07:37:59,060 --> 07:38:03,460
And hellish. Oh wait a freaking dumb. Why must we don't?

6471
07:38:06,580 --> 07:38:10,980
Okay, wait, hold on hold the freaking telephone

6472
07:38:11,940 --> 07:38:13,940
Okay, there we go

6473
07:38:14,900 --> 07:38:20,020
I definitely need a third monar. Honestly. I felt that right now as I'm currently trying to like arrange so many things

6474
07:38:20,340 --> 07:38:22,340
Okay, hydration check

6475
07:38:31,300 --> 07:38:33,300
I am going to do one

6476
07:38:34,100 --> 07:38:37,620
Yeah, one of those portrait monars. Yeah, definitely like chat orientating

6477
07:38:38,580 --> 07:38:42,500
Right, uh because there's so many horses ones

6478
07:38:42,900 --> 07:38:48,740
I'm actually going to take us to the thieves district if I can find a fast port which I can

6479
07:38:52,420 --> 07:38:54,420
Uh mercy

6480
07:38:55,540 --> 07:38:57,700
One hour 20 minutes mercy

6481
07:39:00,180 --> 07:39:02,180
Mercy modest more like mercy

6482
07:39:08,500 --> 07:39:12,020
We're like mercy didn't know what countdown was. Yeah

6483
07:39:17,700 --> 07:39:23,220
We're like all our all like mercy senpais are more deceased. Oh

6484
07:39:26,580 --> 07:39:28,580
Mercy just catches straight a little

6485
07:39:29,540 --> 07:39:30,660
Oh

6486
07:39:30,660 --> 07:39:32,660
Well, I'm dissing my

6487
07:39:33,540 --> 07:39:38,980
My fellow gen mate, but I'm so bad at like dissing because I just like I

6488
07:39:40,420 --> 07:39:43,860
Oh, I need to put you in the scaffold and please let me grab you

6489

No, no, no, I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight. Please. Can I grab you?

6490
07:39:48,420 --> 07:39:50,900
Can I grab you? Wait, I can't grab them when they're in

6491
07:39:52,580 --> 07:39:54,580
Right, that's two of three

6492
07:39:55,540 --> 07:39:57,540
I'll leave me alone

6493
07:39:58,100 --> 07:40:05,220
Uh, is there any more scaffolding if there's more scaffolding now's the time to reveal yourself

Oh, there is uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, please come this way

07:40:14,340 --> 07:40:21,220
Please come this way. Oh, look at this lovely scaffolding that someone's put up for them. She cooking mercy. What's she doing?

6496
07:40:21,860 --> 07:40:26,180
I'm zero. I'm trying to do this tracks. Well, I'm absolutely rubbish at them

6497
07:40:28,260 --> 07:40:32,580
And I'm like try to pretend I know how to do this track with the plausible

6498
07:40:38,260 --> 07:40:41,700
Now you're not coming over come here right now come here. Come here

6499
07:40:44,100 --> 07:40:48,420
I'm wondering uh, it's terrible. This isn't gonna work out. Well, I don't think

6500
07:40:48,900 --> 07:40:52,740
Kill these two right. We've got a double assassination out of that. No

6501
07:40:53,860 --> 07:40:59,860
It's you. You're a bit too efficient at your job. I didn't actually want to assassinate them

6502
07:41:00,980 --> 07:41:03,060
Talk about a third monitor and I still only have one

6503
07:41:06,100 --> 07:41:08,100
If you come to be sure you might need three

6504
07:41:11,540 --> 07:41:13,540
Moment and mummy are you? Yeah

6505
07:41:15,140 --> 07:41:17,140
Or mommy

6506
07:41:18,500 --> 07:41:20,980
Uh, wait, what I needed to I need to go do horse missions

6507
07:41:21,780 --> 07:41:23,780
Right, we're gonna go to the thieves guild

6508
07:41:25,380 --> 07:41:27,380
Which I totally know the name all

6509
07:41:28,340 --> 07:41:30,340
The thieves guild

6510
07:41:31,140 --> 07:41:33,140
Why is it all the way down here?

6511
07:41:34,340 --> 07:41:37,540
Is that like the last one? You know what?

6512
07:41:41,460 --> 07:41:43,460
Yeah, you're dumb

6513
07:41:44,740 --> 07:41:46,740
She would never diss me. She loved me

6514
07:41:47,700 --> 07:41:52,740
Oh, I can't remember what my diss was on you. I've already forgot. I thought I was like a zero duly more like

6515
07:41:53,140 --> 07:41:55,460
Oh, that's what I was like a zero duly more like a zero duke

6516
07:41:55,940 --> 07:41:59,540
That's really like the most rubbish things like nonsense

6517
07:42:00,420 --> 07:42:04,660
I was trying to do like visual number of horror games. Are we allowed to recommend? Yeah, you can always recommend stuff

6518
07:42:04,740 --> 07:42:06,900
Isn't that probable right? Uh, horse activities

6519
07:42:08,900 --> 07:42:13,860
Right, I need to run 300 meters and interrupted you can do it at this section super duper easily

6520
07:42:14,260 --> 07:42:17,140
Uh, definitely recommend going to the thieves guild in order to this

6521
07:42:18,340 --> 07:42:20,340
Is there a delay more like fun to the bosom?

6522
07:42:25,620 --> 07:42:32,660
Your third monitor should be used exclusively to ignore chat. Why would I ignore chat? It's literally the best part of streaming

6523
07:42:36,180 --> 07:42:39,060
Other than like when the gameplay gets intense then uh

6524
07:42:39,940 --> 07:42:41,940
I'm thinking for that

6525
07:42:42,020 --> 07:42:44,740
It's really like a perfect circle here. Can I just come circles?

6526
07:42:45,540 --> 07:42:49,380
If you get motion sick close your eyes mercy. Look away. Don't watch stream here, man

6527
07:42:53,380 --> 07:42:58,020
What would happen if it's the oddest time of each of our I think you'd have a lot of fun girls

6528
07:42:59,380 --> 07:43:01,380
Hey, hold on

6529
07:43:01,860 --> 07:43:03,860
Uh, right. What do I need next?

6530
07:43:04,580 --> 07:43:06,580
Do

6531
07:43:08,100 --> 07:43:10,100
What

6532
07:43:10,100 --> 07:43:12,980
How have I got the thieves guild crest? I didn't do it

6533
07:43:13,780 --> 07:43:16,980
More like stacey these milk retains literally

6534
07:43:21,700 --> 07:43:23,060
She'd be

6535
07:43:23,060 --> 07:43:30,500
She'd be calling herself a dom when her prototype name was literally cotton bomb. Yeah get wrecked. Yeah

6536
07:43:31,220 --> 07:43:33,220
Uh, right, okay

6537
07:43:34,340 --> 07:43:36,340
Your dedication towards it so it's highly

6538
07:43:38,020 --> 07:43:44,100
It's a good game. What can I say, right? Am I supposed to kill from being on a horse?

6539
07:43:45,140 --> 07:43:47,380
Guards killed well on horseback. Let's go

6540
07:43:49,700 --> 07:43:51,700
Oh, hold on. Let's try again

6541
07:43:51,780 --> 07:43:55,220
Oh, hold on. Hold on. Let me get back on the horse. Sorry. Sorry. Let me quit

6542
07:43:55,780 --> 07:44:01,540
Excuse me. Excuse me. Let me literally get back on the horse. I could you literally let me get back on the horse

6543
07:44:03,780 --> 07:44:08,420
Stop I know you're scared, but we need to try that again. I messed that up like really badly. Hold on

6544
07:44:09,780 --> 07:44:13,220
Okay, let's try that again. I've been destroyed decimated

6545
07:44:14,340 --> 07:44:15,940
Just like

6546
07:44:15,940 --> 07:44:21,940
How decimated your skin is when you interact with rabbits because you're allergic. Ha ha ha ha you're allergic

6547
07:44:22,580 --> 07:44:24,580
Yeah, I'm so good at doing this

6548
07:44:24,980 --> 07:44:29,300
Awful. I'm so sorry. This is absolutely horrendous. I'm just gonna stop talking

6549
07:44:33,620 --> 07:44:35,620
Oh

6550
07:44:36,580 --> 07:44:38,580
I'm a horse

6551
07:44:39,380 --> 07:44:41,380
On an old space commercial

6552
07:44:41,780 --> 07:44:45,300
Wow low blue just like the height of rabbits. Oh

6553
07:44:46,020 --> 07:44:48,020
Oh

6554
07:44:48,340 --> 07:44:54,660
They just make my throat close now literally put you in anaphylactic shock. Oh nothing measured though

6555
07:44:56,100 --> 07:44:58,900
Yeah, okay retconning

6556
07:45:00,100 --> 07:45:02,500
The model we gave you like right now. Holy crap

6557
07:45:03,780 --> 07:45:07,860
Double air assassination. Whoo. Oh actually worked. Wow. Okay

6558
07:45:08,820 --> 07:45:13,380
Alley wait, hold on horse come back stop being scared. Where did the horse go?

6559
07:45:15,300 --> 07:45:18,340
Is it all right fine? I'm just calling my recruits and I'm not doing this

6560
07:45:19,620 --> 07:45:22,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, we don't do this. Give me here. Give me

6561
07:45:23,780 --> 07:45:27,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the people are fighting back take that and this

6562
07:45:28,660 --> 07:45:31,220
Stinky stinky wait that missed

6563
07:45:32,020 --> 07:45:34,820
Oh, well, I like this. I can do with it. Where's my horse? There's one

6564
07:45:36,340 --> 07:45:38,180
Okay, we did the

6565
07:45:38,180 --> 07:45:44,340
We need to just go around killing more guards from horseback and then once that one's done, we'll move on to the next

6566
07:45:45,380 --> 07:45:48,180
Hello, are there any guards?

6567
07:45:49,060 --> 07:45:53,060
It's you quieter. Hello. Are there any guards?

6568
07:45:56,420 --> 07:45:58,420
I get turned into a horse

6569
07:45:58,500 --> 07:46:00,500
because they get oh

6570
07:46:00,500 --> 07:46:02,500
Would you want to be a horse feature?

6571
07:46:04,900 --> 07:46:08,260
If I would change into another animal

6572
07:46:10,420 --> 07:46:12,740
I'd maybe make you

6573
07:46:13,700 --> 07:46:15,700
What would I make you?

6574
07:46:16,100 --> 07:46:21,460
Thank goodness. I'm not on the development team anymore when it comes to that shiz. So don't worry. You're not getting any more bad names

6575
07:46:22,660 --> 07:46:24,660
No, no

6576
07:46:24,740 --> 07:46:30,500
Uh, hi jack. I'm to commandeer a horse without killing. Okay, so that's one for the commandeering

6577
07:46:31,140 --> 07:46:33,780
Oh, my horse has like a little backpack now. Oh

6578
07:46:36,740 --> 07:46:41,460
A little backpack on the horse. Okay, so that just need to like keep running around open to run into

6579
07:46:41,940 --> 07:46:43,940
Okay, here we go

6580
07:46:46,100 --> 07:46:48,100
Okay, that was one more

6581
07:46:50,180 --> 07:46:52,180
Okay, we're gonna call in the assassins

6582
07:46:53,620 --> 07:46:57,620
As soon as they get on a horse. I don't like it. I get scared. Oh

6583
07:46:58,900 --> 07:47:05,940
Oh, that was guard on horseback assassination. That was good. That was good. There's only been like three surprising ones

6584
07:47:05,940 --> 07:47:07,940
Hmm

6585
07:47:08,180 --> 07:47:14,180
Let's see if we can do another double. Maybe yeah, okay nice double. We're racking up them numbers really quick. We are we are

6586
07:47:15,620 --> 07:47:21,860
Uh, I'll let the assassin feel with this. I'm gonna get this guy. I'm getting out of here. No, you're literally in my way

6587
07:47:25,700 --> 07:47:28,180
Horse features also have a very big buff because of course

6588
07:47:29,060 --> 07:47:31,060
Mm-hmm

6589
07:47:34,020 --> 07:47:37,540
Uh, right we need to get back on a horsey horsey

6590
07:47:38,980 --> 07:47:40,980
Hello

6591
07:47:42,260 --> 07:47:44,260
And then

6592
07:47:44,980 --> 07:47:51,540
We're getting there. We're slowly, uh whittling it down to not much. Oh, I'm stuck on a rock. Mm-hmm

6593
07:47:51,540 --> 07:47:53,540
Oh

6594
07:47:55,620 --> 07:48:04,900
Right enemies enemies enemy. Oh, who we got who we got? Uh, I just need to hijack without killing. Thank you. So that's two for 10

6595
07:48:09,140 --> 07:48:12,020
That's two for 10 for common deer and a horse

6596
07:48:14,660 --> 07:48:16,660
Uh

6597
07:48:16,660 --> 07:48:22,660
I need to do the hide spot things. So maybe I'll go into the spale here in time. I don't count. Oh rubbish

6598
07:48:23,540 --> 07:48:29,140
What was an enemy back here? What was it? Oh, right you right you're three of 10. Thank you very much

6599
07:48:31,620 --> 07:48:33,620
Appreciate it

6600
07:48:34,500 --> 07:48:37,140
Actually, I'm gonna go for these guys because we're just easy

6601
07:48:39,860 --> 07:48:42,740
Oh, pardon me. I'm just calling this ass and zoom

6602
07:48:43,460 --> 07:48:49,860
No, stop running away. I know it's scary when I start. Oh, uh hijack. Thank you very much

6603
07:48:50,820 --> 07:48:55,060
Wait, if he keeps going on horses, can I just farm him?

6604
07:49:00,660 --> 07:49:07,620
Oh, no, my sassons are gonna get um, okay, I have learned today I have learned let me get this guy here

6605
07:49:07,780 --> 07:49:09,780
I

6606
07:49:10,420 --> 07:49:15,060
Think I can just farm him over and over again and because I jump off my horse to do it

6607
07:49:15,460 --> 07:49:17,460
He jumps on main automatically

6608
07:49:17,940 --> 07:49:20,260
Right what? Uh, what was that like five?

6609
07:49:21,460 --> 07:49:23,460
So he's gonna get on the horse

6610
07:49:24,500 --> 07:49:26,500
six

6611
07:49:27,540 --> 07:49:29,540
Okay

6612
07:49:31,700 --> 07:49:33,700
Oh my goodness

6613
07:49:34,020 --> 07:49:38,100
Seven grand theft dressage, but I didn't get the thing yet

6614
07:49:39,620 --> 07:49:41,620
That's funny as anything though

6615
07:49:42,420 --> 07:49:47,060
Oh my god, this is actually really funny eight. I think eight

6616
07:49:50,180 --> 07:49:52,180
Nice

6617
07:49:53,380 --> 07:49:57,540
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hey, there we go. There we go. Beautiful beautiful

6618
07:49:58,500 --> 07:50:00,500
Oh

6619
07:50:02,180 --> 07:50:04,180
Right a few more kills from horseback

6620
07:50:05,380 --> 07:50:10,660
That was good. All he wants to do is ride the horse on his way. I just get yonking over and over again

6621
07:50:12,260 --> 07:50:15,380
I mean, did he really want the horse if he just made it that easy for me?

6622
07:50:16,980 --> 07:50:20,420
Okay, we're at the bath house. I recognize this part of the map

6623
07:50:22,180 --> 07:50:27,060
Uh, I think we're gonna have to go in a bit more to find more guards. We've literally just gone on the outskirts there

6624
07:50:27,620 --> 07:50:29,620
of the map

6625
07:50:30,260 --> 07:50:36,100
Uh, a few more assassinations from a horse while on horse back

6626
07:50:37,460 --> 07:50:39,780
Well, oh no, hold on. Let me check

6627
07:50:41,620 --> 07:50:43,620
Very quickly

6628
07:50:45,060 --> 07:50:47,620
Stoney has d need d need

6629
07:50:49,540 --> 07:50:57,060
Is this the horse one guards on horseback air assassinate guards caled whale on horse whale on horseback

6630
07:50:57,140 --> 07:51:02,340
Okay, I'm gonna get my crossbow out and we're literally just going on a spree then

6631
07:51:03,620 --> 07:51:05,620
Uh, I need to stay on horseback now

6632
07:51:07,780 --> 07:51:09,780
Oh, I'm going the wrong way

6633
07:51:12,100 --> 07:51:15,460
I need to go to the wards the coliseum, which is this way

6634
07:51:16,500 --> 07:51:19,780
What's that you played assassins creeds so much that you recognize which way you need to go

6635
07:51:20,020 --> 07:51:22,180
Maybe maybe not. What's it to you?

6636
07:51:23,940 --> 07:51:25,940
Right, there should be four enemies here. Okay

6637
07:51:27,300 --> 07:51:29,300
I'm surprised how casual this is

6638
07:51:32,180 --> 07:51:34,180
One

6639
07:51:35,220 --> 07:51:39,540
Two don't pull me off. Don't pull me off. I'm scared. Stop. You're scaring me right

6640
07:51:40,420 --> 07:51:42,420
That's four

6641
07:51:42,580 --> 07:51:44,580
Okay, there we go

6642
07:51:48,340 --> 07:51:50,420
Oh wait

6643
07:51:50,420 --> 07:51:53,620
We need to do the beam trick. I think this is the beam trick

6644
07:51:54,340 --> 07:52:00,180
Oh, that was the beam trick, right? We need to do that 19 more times. I'm not even hitting hold on and we need to lure the guards

6645
07:52:01,060 --> 07:52:03,060
Come here. Come come come

6646
07:52:03,700 --> 07:52:05,700
Lure these men away

6647
07:52:06,340 --> 07:52:07,300
No

6648
07:52:07,300 --> 07:52:09,300
Lure them away. Yeah, there you go

6649
07:52:09,300 --> 07:52:15,860
Uh, right. We basically need to go back and forth over and over jumping on this beam

6650
07:52:17,460 --> 07:52:20,660
No, you didn't do it. See oh that wasn't it. That wasn't the trick

6651
07:52:21,220 --> 07:52:27,700
We needed to do that flip you saw literally 19 times more do a flip. It's you

6652
07:52:28,580 --> 07:52:32,900
Right and I want to know it see we'll try again

6653
07:52:34,580 --> 07:52:36,580
They need to jump a specific

6654
07:52:43,700 --> 07:52:47,700
Jump holds flip. Okay jump hold flip

6655
07:52:48,260 --> 07:52:52,500
So I need to tap a and then hold it so 18 more time

6656
07:52:55,460 --> 07:52:57,060
Jump hold

6657
07:52:57,060 --> 07:53:02,340
No, okay. I think we needed a bit more speed that time a bit more give us a bit more energy a bit more energy

6658
07:53:02,580 --> 07:53:03,540
little

6659
07:53:03,540 --> 07:53:05,540
Little bull's eye a little horsey-worsy

6660
07:53:06,500 --> 07:53:08,500
Do a better run up for it hold

6661
07:53:09,380 --> 07:53:12,180
And that horse just blocked us and jump and hold

6662
07:53:13,300 --> 07:53:15,300
Why did that not work that chain?

6663
07:53:17,700 --> 07:53:19,700
I'm not sure why that didn't work

6664
07:53:22,500 --> 07:53:24,500
Yeah, but we'll talk with those. It's not bad

6665
07:53:25,380 --> 07:53:29,300
Didn't in the corner my right and uh jump

6666
07:53:29,940 --> 07:53:36,100
Okay, I purposely did that a bit later than when I would have selected a so it's 17 more

6667
07:53:37,700 --> 07:53:39,380
I can do it

6668
07:53:39,380 --> 07:53:42,340
Uh betley. Oh, no, okay, right

6669
07:53:43,060 --> 07:53:50,740
Are you gonna have to bear with me bear with me I see is in this room right now because you're gonna have to bear with me

6670
07:53:51,300 --> 07:53:53,300
Bear with me

6671
07:53:53,460 --> 07:53:55,460
few seconds

6672
07:53:56,260 --> 07:54:01,140
Steady jump and hold. Yay 16 more times. Let's go

6673
07:54:02,980 --> 07:54:07,060
I definitely seem to be able to do it come in from that way. I'm wondering if I can't do it this way

6674
07:54:07,140 --> 07:54:10,180
Maybe there's like a hidden bug and I jump and hold

6675
07:54:13,300 --> 07:54:15,300
Maybe it's the one way type of

6676
07:54:17,860 --> 07:54:19,380
We're getting there

6677
07:54:19,380 --> 07:54:26,740
70 more. Let's go. Literally. It's like, oh, I'm so glad you guys put this really arbitrary arbitrary. Okay, really

6678
07:54:27,460 --> 07:54:32,340
Really premature with that one. I'm not gonna I'm not even gonna. No, no the horse

6679
07:54:34,340 --> 07:54:36,020
That was uh

6680
07:54:36,020 --> 07:54:38,020
Let's try that again

6681
07:54:38,180 --> 07:54:43,780
Yeah, literally. I wish the NPCs would actually calm down about my rely. Oh, no

6682
07:54:46,580 --> 07:54:50,260
I honestly, I'm not sure how I'm getting it sometimes and not other times

6683
07:54:51,060 --> 07:54:55,140
My only guess is that an NPC is making it so like

6684
07:54:55,620 --> 07:54:57,380
pathing mess up

6685
07:54:57,380 --> 07:54:59,380
Jump hold

6686
07:55:00,980 --> 07:55:02,980
What is going on

6687
07:55:03,460 --> 07:55:06,740
What is going on? I'm not actually sure why sometimes I'm getting that right

6688
07:55:06,740 --> 07:55:09,460
We'll do a really big run up just because we can

6689
07:55:11,540 --> 07:55:19,380
Okay, so run and then stand and then jump and hold. Okay. Okay. It's speed. It's speed. We need it

6690
07:55:19,380 --> 07:55:21,380
We need a bigger run up 15 more times

6691
07:55:22,900 --> 07:55:30,180
15 more times. Okay big big long journey one two three four five jump and hold

6692
07:55:30,180 --> 07:55:38,100
15 is still the number. We can't do it. This is not at all

6693
07:55:39,300 --> 07:55:43,300
A bit of a grind. I don't know why so a bit more of a grind than I was expecting. Run

6694
07:55:45,060 --> 07:55:47,060
And jump and hold

6695
07:55:50,260 --> 07:55:52,260
I honestly don't understand what's determined in

6696
07:55:53,300 --> 07:55:54,260
a

6697
07:55:54,260 --> 07:55:56,260
Maybe do the middle one like jump lay

6698
07:55:57,220 --> 07:56:00,500
I think you may be right. We'll jump lay on purpose this time. Okay

6699
07:56:02,580 --> 07:56:05,540
Not doing it. Not doing it. Not doing it. We'll jump now and hold. No

6700
07:56:09,940 --> 07:56:11,940
Thank you for at least coming back

6701
07:56:16,740 --> 07:56:18,740
15 is better than 20

6702
07:56:20,180 --> 07:56:25,620
And 14 is better than 15. Whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no

6703
07:56:26,260 --> 07:56:29,300
No, no, no, no, no

6704
07:56:32,260 --> 07:56:37,620
No is the appropriate response after seeing that out loud

6705
07:56:40,740 --> 07:56:42,740
Oh, all right. No, that didn't work

6706
07:56:44,100 --> 07:56:46,660
Uh, I think I'm getting speed blocked or something

6707
07:56:48,100 --> 07:56:50,820
Because this is what we're on 14 or

6708
07:56:51,860 --> 07:56:54,900
13 no, not 13 close to 13

6709
07:56:57,060 --> 07:57:00,020
We can do it. I literally feel like Bilbo Baggins when he's like

6710
07:57:00,820 --> 07:57:06,580
Uh, he's like trying not to be like a bit. Um, just growing old with like the door showing up

6711
07:57:07,540 --> 07:57:11,140
And I'm like, oh, it's fine. It's fine. No

6712
07:57:12,580 --> 07:57:14,580
This is very

6713
07:57:19,220 --> 07:57:25,220
Maybe you have to be under the beams. Okay, I'll definitely like I'll super delay at this time like genuinely super delay

6714
07:57:27,220 --> 07:57:33,220
No, he just he just jumped straight on it if you do it like super delayed. Okay

6715
07:57:36,100 --> 07:57:41,380
Curious curious, right? I'll try again because 14

6716
07:57:43,780 --> 07:57:46,980
Like I can do this honestly. It's just so

6717
07:57:47,940 --> 07:57:51,540
I'm trying to avoid that guy. I try to avoid that guy. I think

6718
07:57:52,260 --> 07:57:54,260
I just need to let the horse maybe

6719
07:57:54,340 --> 07:58:01,780
Directly steer even if the horse is a little off because my the steering as soon as I stand on the horse's saddle the steering

6720
07:58:05,140 --> 07:58:07,140
Oh

6721
07:58:08,260 --> 07:58:13,060
So I just realized since you're in Australia, does that mean you've been streaming 3m? 4am is my stream time

6722
07:58:15,140 --> 07:58:17,140
Daylight saving and stuff

6723
07:58:17,460 --> 07:58:19,460
But it's healthy

6724
07:58:19,780 --> 07:58:21,780
It's healthy

6725
07:58:21,780 --> 07:58:28,820
It's it means I can do stuff during the day. Oh 13 13. Okay. I don't know. I genuinely didn't do anything different

6726
07:58:28,900 --> 07:58:31,300
I think it really is just luck of the draw or something because

6727
07:58:32,180 --> 07:58:34,180
I did not do anything

6728
07:58:35,780 --> 07:58:38,260
Ah, I was gonna say hopefully we get to in a row

6729
07:58:40,500 --> 07:58:46,020
This is such a bizarre like challenge type thing honestly

6730
07:58:50,420 --> 07:58:52,420
No, why why why?

6731
07:58:53,940 --> 07:58:55,940
30 no, not 30 13

6732
07:58:59,060 --> 07:59:01,060
Spreads build up just straight up and uh

6733
07:59:02,820 --> 07:59:04,820
All bits are so like

6734
07:59:05,380 --> 07:59:08,900
He acts annoyed in the moment. See. Yeah, that was like hardly any build up

6735
07:59:08,900 --> 07:59:10,900
So I think that's why that one's in the one

6736
07:59:13,060 --> 07:59:20,020
Mmm, um, let's not be knocking down women. I only want to knock up women. Thank you very much

6737
07:59:21,060 --> 07:59:24,900
Oh, wait, I don't want to knock down women. I only want to knock them up

6738
07:59:26,660 --> 07:59:28,660
Please laugh

6739
07:59:32,340 --> 07:59:34,340
One more time without doing a massive thing

6740
07:59:38,900 --> 07:59:40,900
Uh

6741
07:59:42,100 --> 07:59:48,580
Yeah, I forgot I forgot I had it too. Okay. I forgot legit. I'll need to add a laughing track as well. Oh

6742
07:59:49,140 --> 07:59:53,700
Brother this guy's thanks. Yeah, I'm gonna have to add uh

6743
07:59:54,180 --> 07:59:57,460
Um, I'll add a laughing track. I should add a laughing track

6744
07:59:57,540 --> 07:59:59,940
That's like one that's good and then one that's like

6745
08:00:00,580 --> 08:00:05,300
Uh, I gets a few coughs and like a giggle. So it's like a bad joke. I'm definitely need to get that

6746
08:00:06,260 --> 08:00:08,260
Hmm

6747
08:00:08,580 --> 08:00:13,940
I need to hydrate my goodness. I'm like trying so hard to figure out like what's determined in this jump or not

6748
08:00:16,820 --> 08:00:18,820
I need some crickets. Yeah

6749
08:00:20,420 --> 08:00:23,220
Do the joke again. I let my laugh in my other jacket

6750
08:00:24,420 --> 08:00:27,860
Oh, you left your laugh in the other jacket. Ha ha you spelt it wrong

6751
08:00:28,100 --> 08:00:32,580
Everyone pointing laugh you spelt his thing wrong and I read it out and now he's embarrassed

6752
08:00:32,900 --> 08:00:38,980
Ha ha ha streamer read out your message with a spelling error. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh that that was just gross

6753
08:00:43,380 --> 08:00:45,380
Right, okay, we're gonna try gallop now

6754
08:00:46,660 --> 08:00:50,180
The only issue with galloping is if you gallop through a crowd too much

6755
08:00:53,460 --> 08:00:57,860
No, that was far too early. Okay. I'm kind of struggled with it. We'll try the gallop from this side

6756
08:00:58,820 --> 08:01:05,620
It's over. It's over. You'll never recover. Your social credit has been determined

6757
08:01:05,940 --> 08:01:11,620
No, okay, that gallop doesn't seem to enable that jump whatsoever. I like how the horse is so responsive

6758
08:01:11,620 --> 08:01:13,620
It's like where'd you go? Please come back

6759
08:01:16,100 --> 08:01:18,100
Oh, is it the digration?

6760
08:01:19,140 --> 08:01:21,140
Degoration degradation

6761
08:01:21,300 --> 08:01:23,300
Degration degradation

6762
08:01:23,300 --> 08:01:25,300
Degration sounds correct

6763
08:01:25,460 --> 08:01:27,960
Instead of degradation. Oh 12

6764
08:01:29,860 --> 08:01:35,060
I'm just so surprised when it does happen. It seems to happen in that direction more than it happens in this

6765
08:01:37,140 --> 08:01:39,460
No, look close it's over not quite

6766
08:01:41,060 --> 08:01:43,460
I do want you on the beans, but I want you to do that

6767
08:01:43,460 --> 08:01:46,100
We fancy flip that you do they should have made it 10

6768
08:01:46,580 --> 08:01:51,060
No, they actually shouldn't have done this all because literally how would you have discovered that it so can even do this?

6769
08:01:51,140 --> 08:01:54,180
I'm sorry, but I would never have naturally discovered that he could do this

6770
08:01:56,180 --> 08:01:58,180
Good night. Rest well. Thank you for hanging

6771
08:01:59,940 --> 08:02:01,940
We're uh

6772
08:02:01,940 --> 08:02:05,460
Oh, I actually can't see how long I've been streaming for I've accidentally covered it up with my uh

6773
08:02:06,020 --> 08:02:08,900
Little list of things that I need to do. Oopsie. Whoopsie

6774
08:02:10,180 --> 08:02:12,180
Oh, that was like really

6775
08:02:16,020 --> 08:02:18,660
It feels like has cooled down honestly

6776
08:02:19,460 --> 08:02:22,420
The brain rot took over. Yeah, it took over long ago. I apologize

6777
08:02:23,140 --> 08:02:26,100
Eight hours. I've only been streaming eight hours. I've got a few more in me

6778
08:02:28,900 --> 08:02:31,700
I want this one over because I never want to have to do it again

6779
08:02:32,660 --> 08:02:34,260
Like I don't want to have to come back to this

6780
08:02:34,420 --> 08:02:39,220
I but I know you guys have been literally watching me do a backflip on do a flip on a horse for like 10 minutes

6781
08:02:39,220 --> 08:02:41,700
Now it's gonna be just no one's laughing

6782
08:02:43,380 --> 08:02:48,340
Getting aggravating it right. I am running. I am running. I'm holding

6783
08:02:49,220 --> 08:02:51,220
Oh

6784
08:02:51,620 --> 08:02:53,620
11

6785
08:02:54,900 --> 08:03:01,620
Okay, I think it's 11. No, I don't know why right. I'll run up for ages. Hold. No

6786
08:03:05,300 --> 08:03:07,700
Oh, we're almost 50% of the way there

6787
08:03:11,460 --> 08:03:13,060
Absolutely

6788
08:03:13,060 --> 08:03:14,500
Only

6789
08:03:14,500 --> 08:03:19,300
Oh, well, you guys are gonna feel at a place when you see me only only for like two hours tomorrow

6790
08:03:19,460 --> 08:03:21,460
You're gonna be like, what's wrong? Is she sick?

6791
08:03:24,100 --> 08:03:27,700
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no, you have done

6792
08:03:34,580 --> 08:03:39,780
10 10 right. I feel like it always happens come in this direction instead of the other direction

6793
08:03:40,740 --> 08:03:46,340
I feel like you can't even do a flip. We're not flipping out on you. You're not flipping out on me

6794
08:03:49,460 --> 08:03:53,620
Insert laugh track here that I still haven't added yet, but I will have the laugh tracks into him

6795
08:03:54,980 --> 08:03:56,980
Please get the heck out of my way. I'm trying to do

6796
08:03:57,860 --> 08:03:59,860
You

6797
08:04:06,740 --> 08:04:09,540
Can you leave me alone? No

6798
08:04:13,380 --> 08:04:21,060
No money is worth this he said I do need to kill from horseback. So maybe just do that real quick

6799
08:04:21,780 --> 08:04:30,180
We'll just do this one to add to the horseback one. So we're still making progress even though it's

6800
08:04:41,300 --> 08:04:43,380
Okay, that's that's the sound I need to add right now

6801
08:04:46,180 --> 08:04:48,180
But if I do the flip it goes

6802
08:04:48,900 --> 08:04:51,220
Don't worry, I'll get a little bit for you. I'm dead

6803
08:04:56,420 --> 08:05:02,420
Flipping on a beam off a whole horse this sucks and I don't know why they asked for 20

6804
08:05:06,580 --> 08:05:09,940
Stop taking people's horses. It's really not

6805
08:05:09,940 --> 08:05:11,940
No, I

6806
08:05:15,300 --> 08:05:20,900
I'm looking to see if there's like a prompt that's like double tap to do a beam or jump or whatever about

6807
08:05:23,300 --> 08:05:27,060
No happening, it's no happening, but we're halfway there. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it

6808
08:05:27,060 --> 08:05:29,060
We do it. We uh, well

6809
08:05:29,140 --> 08:05:31,140
That's probably not gonna work now. Is it? No

6810
08:05:34,020 --> 08:05:38,260
I have lost my mind literally I've been doing flips for thanks for so long

6811
08:05:38,980 --> 08:05:40,980
Please

6812
08:05:41,060 --> 08:05:43,460
Free me free me from the beam

6813
08:05:44,260 --> 08:05:46,580
Oh nine finally

6814
08:05:58,020 --> 08:06:03,060
No, it's you below the beam you could have easily sat back on the horse. I'll be honest

6815
08:06:03,700 --> 08:06:08,500
The skirt looks so funny. You mean has killed he's killed to kill to pull fun

6816
08:06:13,540 --> 08:06:16,340
Eight eight eight eight. Okay, that was actually

6817
08:06:18,100 --> 08:06:21,780
I think I need it. I think I can kill him and it'll count for the horseback

6818
08:06:23,860 --> 08:06:25,940
Oh, I'm getting a spank. I'm getting a spank. I'm sorry

6819
08:06:28,820 --> 08:06:31,140
Actually, I should probably do these guys from horseback as well

6820
08:06:34,020 --> 08:06:36,020
And there we go one

6821
08:06:37,700 --> 08:06:39,700
Two

6822
08:06:40,900 --> 08:06:45,220
Three or I'm going to throw rocks through your window

6823
08:06:48,420 --> 08:06:50,420
All right, let's try this game

6824
08:06:51,140 --> 08:06:53,140
Oh, no, don't jump no stick

6825
08:06:54,020 --> 08:06:56,020
Try going try going

6826
08:06:58,820 --> 08:07:00,820
You mustn't offend the last

6827
08:07:01,380 --> 08:07:07,460
You wouldn't you like me when I'm angry you can't you oh seven seven seven seven I think seven

6828
08:07:11,460 --> 08:07:16,340
I still have yet to figure out what determines it but once it's over with we don't have to do it again

6829
08:07:16,420 --> 08:07:20,820
We got a double. We got a double. We got a double. Oh my god. I've not done that. Can we do a triple?

6830
08:07:21,700 --> 08:07:26,660
Can we do a triple is like my subconscious understanding what I need to do even though my brain like my actual

6831
08:07:27,220 --> 08:07:28,580
conscious doesn't

6832
08:07:28,580 --> 08:07:35,940
No, we got a double though. So it's six only six more to go. I've never done back to that. That's fantastic

6833
08:07:37,140 --> 08:07:40,980
I was literally I'm like is my subconscious knowing what's up, but my conscious is like

6834
08:07:41,860 --> 08:07:46,900
Can't that was far too early me put my glicks on for that one. That's terrible

6835
08:07:49,140 --> 08:07:51,140
Wow, oh baby

6836
08:07:55,780 --> 08:07:57,780
Top 10 moments

6837
08:07:59,220 --> 08:08:03,380
Welcome to watch module. Well, we wait the work. We rate the worst

6838
08:08:05,780 --> 08:08:10,660
Little side quest things that assassin creep brotherhood randomly give you because it is a bit arbitrary

6839
08:08:21,220 --> 08:08:26,020
Only six more can you hold on for six

6840
08:08:29,300 --> 08:08:34,340
I'm starting to lose a little bit, but that's okay because we got five we got five

6841
08:08:36,420 --> 08:08:38,740
I was gonna take it will be be a triple get out of my hand

6842
08:08:39,380 --> 08:08:45,140
Look, I wasn't kidding when people like why would you just grave she be is like everything you should have been

6843
08:08:46,420 --> 08:08:48,820
I wasn't kidding. Was that kidding?

6844
08:08:50,180 --> 08:08:52,180
I was oh four four four

6845
08:08:53,140 --> 08:08:55,140
You

6846
08:09:14,100 --> 08:09:16,100
Or

6847
08:09:16,100 --> 08:09:18,100
Oh

6848
08:09:21,460 --> 08:09:23,460
We're sounded so country

6849
08:09:26,700 --> 08:09:28,700
Wow the sound of the ice cream

6850
08:09:34,660 --> 08:09:37,780
Three three three three three

6851
08:09:46,100 --> 08:09:48,100
Oh

6852
08:10:04,140 --> 08:10:10,100
The people listening in right now that are like waiting on mersey start they're like please for the love of god mersey start

6853
08:10:16,540 --> 08:10:20,860
One more one more one more one more one more

6854
08:10:22,500 --> 08:10:32,300
One more just one more time. We've got to celebrate. Oh, yeah jumping on the horse beam

6855
08:10:35,260 --> 08:10:38,380
Do the random say thing for the guilt

6856
08:10:46,620 --> 08:10:48,620
Oh

6857
08:10:52,780 --> 08:10:57,500
Don't don't ever be such a silly sausage again and

6858
08:11:00,860 --> 08:11:03,460
Your daddy your dad says they've gone

6859
08:11:04,300 --> 08:11:08,140
Don't ever give me such a silly thing again. That was absolute torture

6860
08:11:08,780 --> 08:11:13,580
Lure guards leap of faith guards air assassinate from a beam

6861
08:11:13,980 --> 08:11:15,980
No guards

6862
08:11:19,940 --> 08:11:26,020
Okay, the only thing I can think of doing is attracting these guards over here to no because they would have to be below me

6863
08:11:26,500 --> 08:11:30,900
Where is a beam that a rider goes past?

6864
08:11:31,460 --> 08:11:33,780
Because I think that's what I have to assassinate

6865
08:11:34,500 --> 08:11:37,140
So now forcing around no dive on I

6866
08:11:39,620 --> 08:11:42,860
Think if I do this I might get the horseback kills

6867
08:11:44,180 --> 08:11:46,180
I

6868
08:11:58,380 --> 08:12:01,420
Please come under this beam over here, please harass me under this beam

6869
08:12:01,420 --> 08:12:04,900
Please harass me under this beam. I can't believe the game literally just train me for this moment

6870
08:12:04,900 --> 08:12:08,380
Please come under the beam. Please come under the beam. I take all back. I'm sorry these skills

6871
08:12:14,380 --> 08:12:16,380
I'm sorry

6872
08:12:27,500 --> 08:12:34,260
Where the heck is this mystical beam that the enemies pass under I don't know where it's located

6873
08:12:34,580 --> 08:12:37,740
It's not up here doesn't feel like it's up here at all

6874
08:12:42,220 --> 08:12:45,660
Mission failed you get them next time literally where the heck are these beams?

6875
08:12:47,140 --> 08:12:49,140
Hardly any beams anywhere

6876
08:12:49,940 --> 08:12:54,980
The only beam around here is me having a beamer because of how freaking embarrassing this gameplay is

6877
08:12:57,900 --> 08:13:03,940
To have a beamer means that you are embarrassed and have scarlet face or a red face

6878
08:13:04,260 --> 08:13:06,260
Oh

6879
08:13:25,580 --> 08:13:27,580
Just to be

6880
08:13:28,300 --> 08:13:32,860
Volpe does have missions. I am going to buy ammo and

6881
08:13:33,500 --> 08:13:38,100
I'm gonna do this stationary guy one because it's really easy to do it in this quest

6882
08:13:39,900 --> 08:13:46,300
So I'm gonna go by ammo and we're gonna replay a mission that gives us one of these skills

6883
08:13:47,980 --> 08:13:49,980
requirements

6884
08:13:51,420 --> 08:13:53,420
Claudia yes, she does as well

6885
08:13:54,500 --> 08:13:56,020
I'm

6886
08:13:56,020 --> 08:13:58,380
Try to do sorry who goes there?

6887
08:14:02,380 --> 08:14:04,620
I think I'm actually gonna have to get rid of my rating

6888
08:14:13,300 --> 08:14:15,300
What is needy smart overload it is

6889
08:14:17,060 --> 08:14:19,100
Unfortunately, I actually don't know too much about the game

6890
08:14:19,260 --> 08:14:22,140
But it might be a good thing because we get to play for fun for the first time

6891
08:14:22,500 --> 08:14:25,820
I don't think it's gonna be a very long stream if you're wanting an endurance on that

6892
08:14:25,820 --> 08:14:26,940
I

6893
08:14:26,940 --> 08:14:31,420
Need to go to the shops to buy the sweets for the hand camswing stream

6894
08:14:32,860 --> 08:14:34,860
Why am I here?

6895
08:14:37,020 --> 08:14:39,020
Yeah, sure

6896
08:14:40,140 --> 08:14:47,340
Well, you're no cheap. Oh, I need to buy are I just realized that yeah, I need to buy like tons of art in all the different districts

6897
08:14:48,820 --> 08:14:50,980
To three hours. Yeah, that's like the perfect stream

6898
08:14:52,820 --> 08:14:56,780
Deep gargling didn't overstay as well. Oh, okay. Okay, I did

6899
08:14:57,900 --> 08:14:59,900
young man with an apple man

6900
08:15:02,860 --> 08:15:07,580
He's so done. He's like I have enough of posing. Oh, that's a cool one

6901
08:15:12,820 --> 08:15:19,620
But what art for here, oh wait, I'm like 90% sure you sell failure locations

6902
08:15:20,100 --> 08:15:22,100
Can you please resell me then

6903
08:15:23,300 --> 08:15:24,580
No

6904
08:15:24,580 --> 08:15:28,500
Yeah, the feathers. We'll grab the feathers. I'm sure another's one on the Colosseo

6905
08:15:31,420 --> 08:15:38,020
Are you gonna hundred percent avatar? No, I've never played the RDA side of avatar. I don't like the RDA side

6906
08:15:39,740 --> 08:15:41,740
Can I still visit Leonardo?

6907
08:15:42,740 --> 08:15:47,100
And I don't play the RDA side only play the Navi side and

6908
08:15:48,060 --> 08:15:54,580
It will just be done the Navi. I think the campaign's like six hours on that one if I can remember correctly

6909
08:15:59,060 --> 08:16:04,540
We'll be strange not seeing you before bed and waking up after yeah, it's gonna be an interesting day

6910
08:16:05,420 --> 08:16:10,580
But I do have endurance streams every week kind of planned as long as all goes well

6911
08:16:12,100 --> 08:16:15,420
I'll see what the clipping situation is

6912
08:16:19,420 --> 08:16:21,220
Hi Leonardo

6913
08:16:21,220 --> 08:16:26,460
It's you the people apartments are in turmoil. Yes, it is ill and the pope dead

6914
08:16:26,940 --> 08:16:33,140
It was your doing was it not Leonardo? I swear to you did not die by my end

6915
08:16:33,740 --> 08:16:37,940
This world gets stranger every day. I shall have to focus on my painting

6916
08:16:37,940 --> 08:16:42,100
I work on the small portrait of a woman. I'm growing rather fond of it

6917
08:16:43,260 --> 08:16:48,340
Do not let a beautiful girl distract you from constructing my designs. I have no worries

6918
08:16:49,020 --> 08:16:51,020
Women provide little distraction

6919
08:16:51,380 --> 08:16:53,380
Wait, I don't get it

6920
08:16:53,940 --> 08:16:57,900
He's a gay boy. It's you. Oh, it's pride month. Can he be like that man?

6921
08:16:59,460 --> 08:17:02,860
Can he be like that? That's nice. Oh, I have everything

6922
08:17:03,860 --> 08:17:05,860
I

6923
08:17:09,940 --> 08:17:15,900
Don't have anything to purchase Leonardo about everything wait if I talk to him again

6924
08:17:17,420 --> 08:17:21,600
You have all that I can give now. You're on your own. Ah, Leonardo

6925
08:17:22,180 --> 08:17:24,180
Get back you

6926
08:17:25,140 --> 08:17:27,140
Give me some of that

6927
08:17:27,380 --> 08:17:31,740
Good day for catching up on cooking balls and things and no engineering. Yeah

6928
08:17:31,780 --> 08:17:38,620
And so the clipping situation I don't want the girls feeling stressed out thinking like I have to clip like and stream at

6929
08:17:38,620 --> 08:17:42,140
The same time and like deal with all this and try and do collabs all the girls and all that

6930
08:17:42,660 --> 08:17:46,380
And deal with the audios and blah blah blah. So I don't want to stress them out

6931
08:17:46,540 --> 08:17:50,660
So when you guys like do a make a YouTube clip

6932
08:17:50,660 --> 08:17:55,940
I can go on their accounts and see what someone's clipped and if it is like clippable

6933
08:17:55,940 --> 08:18:00,500
Where's a I can then send the timestamp onto like an actual clip editor

6934
08:18:01,500 --> 08:18:08,900
To make clips for them and I just need to see how it works out in theory obviously when I do endured streams

6935
08:18:08,900 --> 08:18:11,420
I can't do any of it like right now for them and

6936
08:18:13,580 --> 08:18:15,580
But we

6937
08:18:15,860 --> 08:18:17,540
Will see how it goes

6938
08:18:17,540 --> 08:18:23,140
I don't know if I need to like put out a little ad saying like I need more clippers of this particular style

6939
08:18:23,700 --> 08:18:26,500
Because there's a particular clipping editing style

6940
08:18:27,100 --> 08:18:32,340
That I'm looking for the most recent mercy shorts the blonde hair short

6941
08:18:33,220 --> 08:18:35,060
and the other

6942
08:18:35,060 --> 08:18:37,060
short of forgotten

6943
08:18:38,100 --> 08:18:43,260
And is the clipping style so if you really can do that in style

6944
08:18:43,940 --> 08:18:45,940
You know, don't be afraid to help the website

6945
08:18:47,660 --> 08:18:50,580
Because that's kind of what I'm needing at this point

6946
08:18:51,260 --> 08:18:53,260
Good thing. I've got a few clips already

6947
08:18:53,300 --> 08:19:00,260
My job is not necessary. If you're a general clipper and we do I'm still interested in doing the clipping

6948
08:19:00,340 --> 08:19:02,820
Enterprise that like I don't end on which is really good

6949
08:19:03,580 --> 08:19:09,260
Obviously need to get monetized first and set up and see whether my funds and the money looks like and all that and

6950
08:19:10,740 --> 08:19:16,380
Because will I tell you a really embarrassing fact, you know the earlier like

6951
08:19:19,140 --> 08:19:21,140
The earlier

6952
08:19:21,340 --> 08:19:24,760
Clips that came out shorts that were on the girls channels

6953
08:19:25,460 --> 08:19:26,420
and

6954
08:19:26,420 --> 08:19:29,940
Amy made two of her a couple of shorts on her own actually

6955
08:19:30,340 --> 08:19:35,860
But I was editing them and I hated them so much and I was so embarrassed. I was like, I'm so sorry girls

6956
08:19:35,860 --> 08:19:43,260
This is the best I can do because we had a quite a few issues behind the scenes production wise with timing

6957
08:19:43,260 --> 08:19:45,260
It was a freaking nightmare

6958
08:19:45,540 --> 08:19:46,900
and

6959
08:19:46,900 --> 08:19:49,540
so like all my attention was elsewhere and

6960
08:19:50,140 --> 08:19:55,300
Like I didn't have time to be like hi clippers. Here's this these files like please wait at them

6961
08:19:57,140 --> 08:20:02,660
Which that's where I did fail like looking back like obviously I'm happy like talk about like where I failed the girls and like I

6962
08:20:02,660 --> 08:20:09,700
Definitely feel like I've failed with them on the clips because the actual plan was the count school life for two weeks

6963
08:20:10,420 --> 08:20:14,980
before stream and there'll be a clip uploaded every day and

6964
08:20:15,660 --> 08:20:20,340
Like I kind of failed the girls like doing that and I feel really bad about it. I feel wrong

6965
08:20:22,220 --> 08:20:27,220
But like the dust is kind of set of already done this but the dust is like kind of settling

6966
08:20:31,700 --> 08:20:39,540
The only bad thing is that for now time zone only you and I see stream at normal times, okay, you may be not in a normal way. Yeah

6967
08:20:45,700 --> 08:20:47,700
You

6968
08:20:50,140 --> 08:20:54,900
Do you know like it definitely went well like the absolutely no denying like

6969
08:21:00,540 --> 08:21:04,720
And I'm definitely not denying like

6970
08:21:06,460 --> 08:21:08,460
debut went well and everything

6971
08:21:08,740 --> 08:21:16,220
Just like I had planned things to just be a lot better and obviously it's not realistic to be like all my plans are all

6972
08:21:16,220 --> 08:21:20,500
I just realized I need to leave the face. We're gonna be jumping off this building for quite well

6973
08:21:22,140 --> 08:21:25,100
Like I understand it's not possible for everything

6974
08:21:27,060 --> 08:21:30,740
For everything to like come out the way of my head and

6975
08:21:31,740 --> 08:21:35,460
Like the girls trailers didn't come out the way I wanted them to

6976
08:21:36,380 --> 08:21:44,060
And but because of like production issues, I couldn't get things like fixed or altered in time for anything really and it was just like

6977
08:21:46,060 --> 08:21:48,060
But yeah

6978
08:21:48,460 --> 08:21:52,860
Yeah, are you winning strong? Yeah, absolutely. Um, are you winning?

6979
08:21:55,540 --> 08:21:59,820
Excuse me, I'm using this cable. I'm so sorry if this makes anyone motion sick

6980
08:21:59,820 --> 08:22:05,340
I'm needing to do leaps of faith and if you jump off a pigeon thing it counts as a leap of faith

6981
08:22:05,980 --> 08:22:08,700
No, it's ill into the hay bed

6982
08:22:09,580 --> 08:22:12,380
No, it's ill into the hay bed

6983
08:22:15,460 --> 08:22:23,180
Yeah, it was a timing issue and we love artists in this house we do but and I

6984
08:22:24,260 --> 08:22:25,860
had given

6985
08:22:25,900 --> 08:22:33,220
Very I feel I had gave incredibly fair deadlines for what I was asking and

6986
08:22:35,260 --> 08:22:42,740
Pretty much across the board the majority went over and if you are an artist that worked with me

6987
08:22:42,740 --> 08:22:45,740
And you did go over deadline like please don't worry and

6988
08:22:46,500 --> 08:22:53,420
Like it's not like a big deal anymore because obviously now everything's out there and everything's all good and we debuted and like that's

6989
08:22:53,420 --> 08:22:54,980
That's the facts

6990
08:22:54,980 --> 08:22:56,980
but I

6991
08:22:57,180 --> 08:22:59,180
had a lot of delays and

6992
08:23:01,220 --> 08:23:03,820
Basically, I had planned every month in advance

6993
08:23:04,660 --> 08:23:09,980
Being like this month. I'll be focused on this this month. I'll be focused on that and what happened was

6994
08:23:11,660 --> 08:23:14,380
Everything had to be done in May and

6995
08:23:15,500 --> 08:23:17,100
Like I'm not gonna lie

6996
08:23:17,100 --> 08:23:23,900
I like cried a few times out of just like pure frustration of like feeling I can't do enough

6997
08:23:24,300 --> 08:23:26,300
because I have to wait for

6998
08:23:27,180 --> 08:23:34,020
Someone to send something back in order for me to progress and give feedback like I had a lot of

6999
08:23:35,660 --> 08:23:37,660
Like issues with

7000
08:23:38,180 --> 08:23:45,300
People not checking what they gave me the first time around and being like hey the reference sheet looks like this or hey

7001
08:23:46,260 --> 08:23:51,340
Like the subtitle that you put here and like it's quite clear that she didn't say this

7002
08:23:51,340 --> 08:23:55,580
But you've literally put it in for some reason or like hey the audio

7003
08:23:56,100 --> 08:23:59,940
Literally cuts out in the middle of this. Can you re-render like I don't know what like

7004
08:24:00,500 --> 08:24:02,500
it was

7005
08:24:02,660 --> 08:24:10,020
It was rubbish and at the same time like obviously the girls know a bit more in detail exactly what I'm talking about and

7006
08:24:10,540 --> 08:24:12,780
Because like I showed them like we are

7007
08:24:14,020 --> 08:24:20,220
Like I'm constantly sending back like please fix this please fix this please fix this and the days are going by and the

7008
08:24:20,220 --> 08:24:25,700
Fixes are taking 24 hours the fixes aren't done within 20 minutes and I get a new rendered version of something

7009
08:24:25,700 --> 08:24:31,940
It's like no 24 hours. I'll do it in the morning. I'll do it later, and I'm like I have paid premium rates

7010
08:24:31,940 --> 08:24:38,980
I shouldn't be the one who is quality checking your work. You should quality check it before you send it to me and

7011
08:24:40,060 --> 08:24:44,420
Like it was just a cascading effect, and it was pretty horrible

7012
08:24:45,340 --> 08:24:46,540
And

7013
08:24:46,540 --> 08:24:52,300
But yeah, but we're here now. So and there were so many lessons learned like

7014
08:24:54,220 --> 08:25:01,380
Rip to future artists if you're interested in working with Veeler, but like everyone's getting contracts like conscripted and stuff like

7015
08:25:03,740 --> 08:25:07,380
And being like if you miss this deadline like you know

7016
08:25:07,900 --> 08:25:09,140
it's

7017
08:25:09,140 --> 08:25:15,540
Just there's just it's not fun being like that like I love giving artists the benefit of the doubt

7018
08:25:15,540 --> 08:25:18,700
But holy is this even counting for leaps of faith?

7019
08:25:20,460 --> 08:25:22,260
Yeah

7020
08:25:22,260 --> 08:25:25,220
Like deadlines are so important and having that like

7021
08:25:26,500 --> 08:25:31,260
My heck are the leaps of faith here. Oh, wow. We're one off of leaf of faith

7022
08:25:33,820 --> 08:25:38,300
Literally in the end we made it everything worked out fight. Wait, did that guard hurt himself?

7023
08:25:39,620 --> 08:25:41,980
and

7024
08:25:41,980 --> 08:25:45,340
Like we made it in the end, but yeah rough rough

7025
08:25:45,940 --> 08:25:47,940
Not fun, but I'm now

7026
08:25:48,300 --> 08:25:52,620
Like I just want to stream. I just want to have fun. I want to show off my games. I want to have a good time

7027
08:25:52,620 --> 08:25:55,180
I want to make ASMR. I want to do everything that I wanted to do

7028
08:25:55,860 --> 08:25:59,020
While I get to do it alongside like these amazing girls type thing

7029
08:25:59,020 --> 08:26:05,340
And I want them to see them achieve their dreams and see how it goes like obviously the the the current goal is

7030
08:26:05,340 --> 08:26:08,540
YouTube to please stop calling us and like admit that we're real

7031
08:26:09,140 --> 08:26:12,340
Like streamers and stuff. You don't need to call us like there's plenty of content

7032
08:26:13,380 --> 08:26:15,140
On channels now

7033
08:26:15,140 --> 08:26:19,180
But yeah, like it definitely like everything works out in the end

7034
08:26:20,980 --> 08:26:23,460
Absolutely is everyone max level

7035
08:26:26,140 --> 08:26:27,500
No

7036
08:26:27,500 --> 08:26:31,100
Three people aren't max. Oh, I didn't mean to do that by a whole

7037
08:26:32,380 --> 08:26:34,380
Yeah, like the worst part is over

7038
08:26:35,100 --> 08:26:37,100
Wait what the heck

7039
08:26:37,140 --> 08:26:39,140
Oopsies, I'm to kill

7040
08:26:39,820 --> 08:26:41,340
the mailman

7041
08:26:41,340 --> 08:26:49,660
Not to be confused with the Sandman that blows literal dust over your eyelashes or some shiz. I was ridiculous

7042
08:26:50,700 --> 08:26:55,860
Never heard of the first time I've ever heard of that nonsense before I heard this song

7043
08:26:56,580 --> 08:26:58,580
But like what?

7044
08:27:04,020 --> 08:27:06,020
For goodness sake

7045
08:27:08,100 --> 08:27:10,100
I

7046
08:27:14,460 --> 08:27:16,460
Love how easy that stuff is

7047
08:27:18,620 --> 08:27:21,940
Oh, excuse me, am I not your mentor?

7048
08:27:26,740 --> 08:27:31,620
Oh, no, the PayPal got fixed and so you can support any of the girls like right now

7049
08:27:31,620 --> 08:27:36,380
I think I need to update my link or something because people say it no work or something

7050
08:27:37,100 --> 08:27:39,100
I don't know

7051
08:27:40,780 --> 08:27:42,780
Oh, you're using the new info

7052
08:27:44,060 --> 08:27:50,500
YouTube on soft as it's old European folklore, of course, it's nonsense. True a

7053
08:27:52,820 --> 08:27:54,820
Literary tree

7054
08:27:55,780 --> 08:27:59,620
Right, I don't really know what the plan is

7055
08:28:00,380 --> 08:28:11,260
Okay, we'll finish the guild people's requests, but I have to admit I'm a bit lost on what next to do

7056
08:28:19,420 --> 08:28:24,820
Get all the guild crests by everything and then I think we might be done maybe the feathers

7057
08:28:25,660 --> 08:28:27,660
And

7058
08:28:27,700 --> 08:28:29,700
And we'll revisit

7059
08:28:33,260 --> 08:28:35,260
Mercy 30 minute

7060
08:28:37,860 --> 08:28:40,300
Did I get the feather from this location I must go

7061
08:28:42,100 --> 08:28:44,100
You did

7062
08:28:44,980 --> 08:28:46,980
Cause a little chaos why not

7063
08:28:49,900 --> 08:28:54,100
Christina, oh I forgot about Christina. Oh, right. Okay. Okay. Okay

7064
08:28:55,780 --> 08:28:57,780
Oh

7065
08:28:59,820 --> 08:29:01,820
I've completed all the renovations

7066
08:29:03,020 --> 08:29:05,020
Wait, so what's my DNA?

7067
08:29:06,460 --> 08:29:09,420
Must be high enough seriously 68

7068
08:29:11,500 --> 08:29:13,500
Is there anything I could do that's really easy

7069
08:29:16,540 --> 08:29:18,540
No, no

7070
08:29:25,540 --> 08:29:28,580
I don't want to do do you know be to take it

7071
08:29:36,220 --> 08:29:39,340
Wait a minute did this one

7072
08:29:49,860 --> 08:29:53,580
That was rubbish that one don't look I discovered no that was rubbish as well

7073
08:29:55,740 --> 08:30:02,660
That was rubbish as well rubbish and maybe the missions

7074
08:30:11,860 --> 08:30:13,860
I've never achieved that

7075
08:30:17,980 --> 08:30:20,780
No, these like so aren't possible

7076
08:30:21,020 --> 08:30:24,220
Well, maybe I need to do

7077
08:30:26,980 --> 08:30:29,380
Wait the assassinations are only a oh

7078
08:30:30,940 --> 08:30:33,940
The assassinations are like only a 41

7079
08:30:37,740 --> 08:30:44,620
Okay, okay, we'll do assassins that'll raise us that'll raise us really quickly like they're super easy super nice and consider it

7080
08:30:46,340 --> 08:30:48,340
So we'll do that

7081
08:30:51,180 --> 08:30:53,180
I

7082
08:30:57,300 --> 08:30:59,300
Climbing up letters, don't mind me

7083
08:31:05,700 --> 08:31:07,940
Y'all excited for my first day some ice cream

7084
08:31:09,500 --> 08:31:11,500
I'm doing something

7085
08:31:11,580 --> 08:31:15,980
Mildly special in it. I'm a bit concerned after what happened to me, but he will

7086
08:31:17,100 --> 08:31:19,900
Apparently she was jumping up and doing on the bed like a monkey

7087
08:31:21,540 --> 08:31:27,700
Yeah, were you there? Did you hear about this? Did you see this?

7088
08:31:29,220 --> 08:31:31,540
What was my cute little sister doing on the bed hello?

7089
08:31:34,100 --> 08:31:36,100
Mmm

7090
08:31:36,540 --> 08:31:41,340
One little in me jumping on the bed and she jumped off and bumped her head

7091
08:31:44,100 --> 08:31:46,100
How is your

7092
08:31:46,100 --> 08:31:48,100
Oh

7093
08:31:49,540 --> 08:31:56,660
Let's see the board to have unleashed their interrogate if they cannot find us we realize people do not let your targets call for

7094
08:31:57,060 --> 08:32:00,540
reinforcements. Oh, I don't know what that means

7095
08:32:01,180 --> 08:32:02,900
kill

7096
08:32:02,900 --> 08:32:05,220
Wait, does that mean like don't get detected?

7097
08:32:06,460 --> 08:32:12,300
She had to fall and land on her ear somehow. Yeah, I remember reading someone's review on it and I was like

7098
08:32:12,980 --> 08:32:17,180
Now I want all my children to succeed

7099
08:32:18,060 --> 08:32:20,060
but apparently

7100
08:32:21,500 --> 08:32:25,300
Apparently we were spitting and licking it back up

7101
08:32:26,700 --> 08:32:33,180
How do you plead to these accusations? I mean, how do you plead to such accusations?

7102
08:32:39,140 --> 08:32:41,140
Actually

7103
08:32:42,060 --> 08:32:43,420
Pin pals

7104
08:32:43,420 --> 08:32:50,020
How do you plead to the accusations that you egged your little sister on?

7105
08:32:51,380 --> 08:32:54,260
To do such devious acts

7106
08:32:54,260 --> 08:32:56,260
I

7107
08:33:08,060 --> 08:33:15,220
Guard is running for backup who who they're all highlighted

7108
08:33:20,540 --> 08:33:22,540
Got kill bruise

7109
08:33:25,020 --> 08:33:31,100
I don't know where that guy ran. I'm not really mad at it because I'm still gonna get DNA anyway, but

7110
08:33:37,860 --> 08:33:39,940
Oh, there's scaffold in there I could grab them

7111
08:33:44,020 --> 08:33:50,780
Not guilty I plead the fifth egged in me on all that's funny. What is she egging you guys on?

7112
08:33:51,100 --> 08:33:56,300
Oh these accusations against my little sister. I will not stand for such things

7113
08:34:00,380 --> 08:34:02,380
Right, okay, let's keep doing

7114
08:34:04,700 --> 08:34:06,700
These

7115
08:34:12,460 --> 08:34:18,580
She knew what she was doing my innocent little sister has no concept of

7116
08:34:19,140 --> 08:34:21,380
What even a double meaning is

7117
08:34:22,380 --> 08:34:27,660
You are looking at her through your your lusty eyes. How dare you?

7118
08:34:29,820 --> 08:34:38,740
No, how dare you labeling on the innocent the innocent turn yet it because that's what the name of her

7119
08:34:40,340 --> 08:34:42,340
So true

7120
08:34:42,820 --> 08:34:44,820
She's always egging his own

7121
08:34:48,580 --> 08:34:54,260
Right, I'm gonna send away those assassins that aren't ready to level out properly

7122
08:34:56,100 --> 08:35:01,460
Thank you, I'll send you on a big big contract big big big big contract

7123
08:35:03,180 --> 08:35:08,660
One two three four five of you

7124
08:35:13,700 --> 08:35:17,500
She turned a guy into a tree like he was asking for okay

7125
08:35:18,980 --> 08:35:23,140
She needs to level up. Okay. She needs to be experienced with what she's doing

7126
08:35:24,260 --> 08:35:26,260
It's not hurtful

7127
08:35:26,500 --> 08:35:31,140
Right, we seem to be about 42 percent use assassin recruits to assist in uh

7128
08:35:31,700 --> 08:35:33,540
diversion

7129
08:35:33,540 --> 08:35:35,540
Kill the merchant while remaining undetected

7130
08:35:36,740 --> 08:35:38,740
He's peasy lemme squee

7131
08:35:40,580 --> 08:35:42,580
Gotta get that xp somehow

7132
08:35:42,980 --> 08:35:44,980
You know what you're right. Her latest

7133
08:35:45,300 --> 08:35:49,860
Alt tweet probably is a misunderstanding exactly. You're just reading it wrong, okay

7134
08:35:53,300 --> 08:35:55,300
Uh

7135
08:35:56,020 --> 08:35:58,020
Can I like lock on to the guy

7136
08:36:04,740 --> 08:36:06,740
Well, let me recall my recruit

7137
08:36:09,780 --> 08:36:11,780
Is it bugged out? Oh

7138
08:36:15,220 --> 08:36:16,340
Oh

7139
08:36:16,340 --> 08:36:21,300
Wait, what was the mission use the session recruits to assist tonight diversion

7140
08:36:25,780 --> 08:36:27,460
Oh, well

7141
08:36:27,460 --> 08:36:29,860
That was easy peasy lemons wheezy. What's going on here?

7142
08:36:31,540 --> 08:36:33,620
We are discussing how

7143
08:36:34,900 --> 08:36:37,300
Pin pals have you so misunderstood

7144
08:36:38,660 --> 08:36:40,820
They're looking at you with

7145
08:36:40,820 --> 08:36:42,820
This

7146
08:36:54,180 --> 08:36:55,380
They do

7147
08:36:55,380 --> 08:37:00,980
I'm trying to tell them that you're innocent. Okay, and that they're not comprehending

7148
08:37:02,020 --> 08:37:08,340
That the you jumping up and down on the bed during your ASMR stream is completely innocent

7149
08:37:08,740 --> 08:37:12,420
And you were literally just singing that song

7150
08:37:13,540 --> 08:37:19,620
Three little monkeys jumping in the bed one fell off and bumped its head first game the doctor or something

7151
08:37:21,540 --> 08:37:23,540
That's not anything fun though. Sure

7152
08:37:26,980 --> 08:37:28,980
All right, I don't get

7153
08:37:32,100 --> 08:37:34,100
We'll do the feathers

7154
08:37:38,340 --> 08:37:40,340
I'm not innocent. That's for e

7155
08:37:49,220 --> 08:37:51,860
Who among us is innocent truly? No

7156
08:37:54,020 --> 08:37:56,740
If I were making an among us reference that it means Lord there

7157
08:37:57,540 --> 08:38:00,580
I was like, did you like that? Uh, and wait, I don't need to go off on it. Okay

7158
08:38:08,340 --> 08:38:10,340
I

7159
08:38:15,860 --> 08:38:22,900
Really suck out of this, you know, it has potential don't tell me otherwise. I won't accept such

7160
08:38:25,860 --> 08:38:28,100
Right, you need to jump up here in order to get this flag

7161
08:38:29,780 --> 08:38:33,700
I need them to come across more thieves to do the lure. I think I have like two more

7162
08:38:34,420 --> 08:38:38,180
Thieves need to lure the guards away. I'm sad. I missed on these. I mean

7163
08:38:39,060 --> 08:38:41,060
I don't good

7164
08:38:43,060 --> 08:38:45,060
It means probably gonna do it

7165
08:38:45,460 --> 08:38:47,460
And ASMR streaming in

7166
08:38:48,740 --> 08:38:51,700
Just uh, maybe a little less

7167
08:38:53,860 --> 08:38:55,860
Uh a little less, perhaps

7168
08:38:57,540 --> 08:38:59,540
You know

7169
08:38:59,540 --> 08:39:01,540
We can't escape

7170
08:39:02,260 --> 08:39:06,740
V suck it could be another brand of ruler. It should be for the the innocent

7171
08:39:08,660 --> 08:39:10,740
The innocent side where I just make them do like

7172
08:39:11,300 --> 08:39:18,100
Girlfriend roleplay audios or like that kind of stuff. But like it's nothing. It doesn't like go any further, you know

7173
08:39:21,860 --> 08:39:26,020
Safer work side that people have been asking for I did get a few emails

7174
08:39:26,500 --> 08:39:27,860
um

7175
08:39:27,860 --> 08:39:32,660
Management showed me them and people were like, uh, is it required to do that?

7176
08:39:33,460 --> 08:39:35,460
and it was like

7177
08:39:36,100 --> 08:39:41,620
Very sadly kind of the the whole point of the agency. Um, that's where the money is

7178
08:39:45,060 --> 08:39:50,660
Oh, oh wait. No, there's not boarder people here anymore. I was getting nervous. So I was gonna get caught and I'm like, wait, man

7179
08:39:50,660 --> 08:39:52,660
There's no boarder

7180
08:39:53,300 --> 08:39:55,300
Oh

7181
08:39:55,380 --> 08:39:57,380
Eye contact roleplay

7182
08:39:58,260 --> 08:40:03,060
Teaching you eye contact proof. Oh, I don't know the best way to climb this. Maybe on the outside of the policy

7183
08:40:07,700 --> 08:40:09,700
Give me that feather

7184
08:40:12,580 --> 08:40:14,180
True love

7185
08:40:14,180 --> 08:40:16,180
Ruffin

7186
08:40:17,620 --> 08:40:21,380
Yeah, like so I did have a few variations of like

7187
08:40:22,180 --> 08:40:26,100
Would there ever be a generation that didn't require that part and it's like

7188
08:40:28,420 --> 08:40:31,460
What's the point? It's just a really agency at that point

7189
08:40:34,340 --> 08:40:35,540
Um

7190
08:40:35,540 --> 08:40:37,540
Where the height was that other feather?

7191
08:40:38,420 --> 08:40:40,340
Oh, it's literally

7192
08:40:40,340 --> 08:40:42,340
split perfectly

7193
08:40:42,500 --> 08:40:44,500
Uh, where there is the

7194
08:40:45,220 --> 08:40:50,340
Jump off point. Oh wait. We have a parachute. All right. We'll just use the parachute off the coliseum

7195
08:40:50,580 --> 08:40:52,580
I

7196
08:40:56,740 --> 08:40:59,860
Come pop off in real food where you can hear audible call. Oh, and me

7197
08:41:06,340 --> 08:41:08,340
All right, we're just gonna do this

7198
08:41:12,180 --> 08:41:14,180
Your assassins

7199
08:41:15,140 --> 08:41:17,140
You

7200
08:41:18,660 --> 08:41:22,580
There's a few uh group roleplay is actually seventh as well. I'm coming out

7201
08:41:23,860 --> 08:41:31,060
Uh, I just can't any time to settle. I only want them to come out once the culling has stopped because literally it's like such a

7202
08:41:32,260 --> 08:41:34,260
shame

7203
08:41:34,260 --> 08:41:36,260
That it is still happening

7204
08:41:37,060 --> 08:41:43,060
Even though like we're like getting into the studio. It's like, yeah, we've like got proper streams now. So I'm not really sure what the deal is

7205
08:41:44,340 --> 08:41:49,220
Like the meme asmr's are literally i'm too scared to even upload them at this point because i'm like

7206
08:41:49,220 --> 08:41:55,300
What's going on with asmr? I think there may have been a stealth policy update or it's about to be introduced publicly

7207
08:41:56,740 --> 08:41:58,740
Feathers up here. Um

7208
08:42:04,340 --> 08:42:11,220
This is a little sister you argued has an innocent mind. Yeah, I'm not arguing in what's innocent of

7209
08:42:14,900 --> 08:42:17,380
Okay, right. We're gonna use the

7210
08:42:21,380 --> 08:42:27,060
Yeah, there's definitely something going on at youtube headquarters when it comes to asmr because

7211
08:42:28,340 --> 08:42:34,020
There's a lot of channels left and right getting yanked for content that previously was fine

7212
08:42:34,740 --> 08:42:36,340
and they're

7213
08:42:36,340 --> 08:42:40,820
my guess is that youtube don't want to publicly say it because

7214
08:42:41,460 --> 08:42:46,420
Asmr is such a popular category on youtube like it's an insanely popular category

7215
08:42:46,980 --> 08:42:49,060
And they don't want to come out and say it

7216
08:42:49,860 --> 08:42:53,620
So they're just tackling it like silently basically

7217
08:42:55,220 --> 08:42:57,220
So it's not arguing

7218
08:42:58,420 --> 08:43:00,420
um

7219
08:43:00,660 --> 08:43:06,180
I think I think the uproar if they publicly said like we're doing this would be so much because asmr

7220
08:43:06,260 --> 08:43:09,140
I think they like said it's like one of the top four categories

7221
08:43:09,940 --> 08:43:16,180
Sorry, like in the top 10 searches a variation of either like food eating or asmr medicines

7222
08:43:16,660 --> 08:43:19,140
Like whatever you want to kind of really get into it

7223
08:43:20,020 --> 08:43:20,980
um

7224
08:43:20,980 --> 08:43:22,900
It's like such a high

7225
08:43:22,900 --> 08:43:27,460
Watched category that if they publicly said like hey, we're drawing the line here now

7226
08:43:28,180 --> 08:43:30,740
I do think there will be a post at some point

7227
08:43:31,140 --> 08:43:36,100
But at the moment it's kind of stealthily being done. So the content is no longer

7228
08:43:36,740 --> 08:43:44,420
Available. So when they do go publicly like hey, we've actually changed this people are like, oh, that's fine

7229
08:43:44,660 --> 08:43:50,420
Because like no one's been uploading it anyway because you know, you've been deleting channels less than right and

7230
08:43:51,140 --> 08:43:53,140
Handing out warnings willy-nilly. So

7231
08:43:54,260 --> 08:43:55,620
Yeah

7232
08:43:55,620 --> 08:44:01,460
That's my guess by the way. This is absolutely not factual. This is like just what my genuine like

7233
08:44:02,180 --> 08:44:04,180
What I think is going on

7234
08:44:04,420 --> 08:44:06,020
um

7235
08:44:06,420 --> 08:44:13,060
YouTube is just like I see. Yeah, it's literally just my guess what's going on. It seems the most probable to me

7236
08:44:14,580 --> 08:44:16,580
um

7237
08:44:16,980 --> 08:44:23,700
So unfortunately, I think like you're looking content's just gonna have to be like

7238
08:44:25,620 --> 08:44:27,780
Just straight up upload it to twitter or

7239
08:44:29,300 --> 08:44:31,300
Put on patreon

7240
08:44:31,860 --> 08:44:33,860
Yeah

7241
08:44:35,460 --> 08:44:42,260
Solution and I know a lot of people are like, oh like just put it like not behind a paywall on patreon

7242
08:44:42,900 --> 08:44:46,100
Unfortunately in order to link your patreon successfully

7243
08:44:47,220 --> 08:44:49,460
Um everything must be behind the paywall

7244
08:44:51,300 --> 08:44:55,380
First like even if it's a fine audio that is not wrong with it

7245
08:44:56,580 --> 08:44:59,300
Um, it has to all be behind a paywall. It's bizarre

7246
08:45:00,260 --> 08:45:04,100
It's bizarre the rules get very arbitrary in memoria

7247
08:45:06,740 --> 08:45:08,740
Now you're wrong YouTube's drunk

7248
08:45:14,420 --> 08:45:20,260
All right, let me see we've done the feathers. I have no idea how many

7249
08:45:22,180 --> 08:45:26,580
We've done right we're getting close to doing the courtesans

7250
08:45:29,300 --> 08:45:31,300
So

7251
08:45:31,620 --> 08:45:33,620
Yeah, like we're so

7252
08:45:34,980 --> 08:45:43,460
Uh enemy stations, right we're gonna do that now because I know how to do that. You have to replay a memory

7253
08:45:44,740 --> 08:45:46,340
from

7254
08:45:46,340 --> 08:45:48,340
the french one

7255
08:45:50,740 --> 08:45:52,740
No

7256
08:45:55,380 --> 08:45:57,380
Yes, this is the one

7257
08:45:57,860 --> 08:46:01,460
Can you stream to x? I wouldn't stream on twitter

7258
08:46:02,660 --> 08:46:04,660
No, you need money on it

7259
08:46:05,940 --> 08:46:10,660
Like I hate to I hate to be that one. I know it sounds really sucky where it's like money money money, but it's like the

7260
08:46:11,460 --> 08:46:15,300
Obviously the girl's name is ported and the thing with youtube boards is like

7261
08:46:15,940 --> 08:46:20,260
Uh, you always like make money on youtube boards and like always look up and yeah

7262
08:46:21,460 --> 08:46:24,580
Once inside your men can overpower the camps patrols, correct?

7263
08:46:25,460 --> 08:46:30,900
Yes, I think it's fine saying like yes, we're not an agency for greed, but at the end of the day

7264
08:46:32,580 --> 08:46:34,580
We need money around

7265
08:46:34,580 --> 08:46:42,020
And the youtube boards is like a fantastic way or the youtube ads on like a small video for example

7266
08:46:42,900 --> 08:46:47,220
Like this kind of stuff is like free to make content like it's free for me to stream right now, you know

7267
08:46:47,300 --> 08:46:53,140
My troops will gather it from the dead and people underestimate the value of ad revenue the uh

7268
08:46:53,620 --> 08:46:55,620
Advertise like the free

7269
08:46:57,220 --> 08:46:59,220
The armor has to stay clean

7270
08:47:01,380 --> 08:47:09,300
Right if you use your crossbow ball in this mission it accepts that last thing like oh, there's a horse right there

7271
08:47:09,860 --> 08:47:11,860
Oh, there's another horse right there

7272
08:47:12,420 --> 08:47:14,420
Yeah

7273
08:47:15,860 --> 08:47:20,020
Businesses move can't do everything for you. Unfortunately, yes, the world is run on

7274
08:47:22,420 --> 08:47:25,060
All right, I'm not going now because really peace forever to get to these guys there

7275
08:47:26,100 --> 08:47:29,540
Um, we'll go this way instead. Yeah, this way's like so much better

7276
08:47:30,580 --> 08:47:34,420
You basically for some reason if you snipe the guys in this one

7277
08:47:35,300 --> 08:47:37,060
um

7278
08:47:37,060 --> 08:47:42,260
They count towards that cortisone thing, but if you snipe in general it doesn't count

7279
08:47:42,980 --> 08:47:44,980
Oh sugar. I'm sorry

7280
08:47:45,140 --> 08:47:47,140
No, I didn't want to do that

7281
08:47:50,100 --> 08:47:56,500
Actually, hold on hold on when the disarm and kill with his own weapon. There we go one of five

7282
08:47:57,460 --> 08:47:59,460
I don't know

7283
08:48:01,460 --> 08:48:05,300
99% of all my problems come silver money. It is a terrible way

7284
08:48:11,540 --> 08:48:12,900
Okay

7285
08:48:12,900 --> 08:48:18,500
We might have to do this twice twice. I'm not sure. Well that guy's coming over to investigate right here

7286
08:48:19,540 --> 08:48:21,540
Another free kill

7287
08:48:21,780 --> 08:48:24,420
Is that guy coming to investigate? Oh these guys are

7288
08:48:25,380 --> 08:48:27,380
I'll take it

7289
08:48:31,860 --> 08:48:34,500
I will loot them just so I can get some of them back

7290
08:48:39,060 --> 08:48:41,060
And that's how the next one might be

7291
08:48:42,980 --> 08:48:48,340
We appreciate that thing but please do always consider supporting the girls

7292
08:48:48,420 --> 08:48:56,900
We should get crossbow bolts from this. Okay hydration check hydration check. I've been yammering but I've not had much water today

7293
08:49:02,580 --> 08:49:06,420
I don't know when we can submit for monetization yet

7294
08:49:07,780 --> 08:49:13,140
As I said the stats like are not updating so it's kind of just uh

7295
08:49:13,860 --> 08:49:15,860
I

7296
08:49:16,420 --> 08:49:18,420
Very casually like

7297
08:49:18,820 --> 08:49:23,300
Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Okay. I'm gonna help

7298
08:49:24,820 --> 08:49:26,820
I'm calling the assassins and

7299
08:49:29,940 --> 08:49:33,460
Oh, I just teabagged him as he died. Okay, that was rather unique

7300
08:49:35,940 --> 08:49:38,980
Let's not do that again. That was uh, really not a move

7301
08:49:44,100 --> 08:49:49,940
But yes, once the youtube calling stops then please do look around uh for

7302
08:49:50,980 --> 08:49:53,860
Very fun ASMR collabs coming out. Um

7303
08:49:56,980 --> 08:50:01,140
Very very large ASMR collabs that cost a lot of money put together by hey-ho. Um

7304
08:50:07,940 --> 08:50:11,540
Um, sorry, I'm like trying to bramble and think and

7305
08:50:13,300 --> 08:50:15,300
Get this done

7306
08:50:19,220 --> 08:50:22,580
I like how he's suspicious even though I literally just perished that guy right there

7307
08:50:27,940 --> 08:50:30,260
God I wish there was a way to pay for all the girls patrons

7308
08:50:30,260 --> 08:50:35,700
I once I just got 16 months back to back. Oh, you support them as patrons. Thank you so much. That's very kind of you

7309
08:50:35,860 --> 08:50:39,540
Thank you. Yes, actually special. Thank you to literally

7310
08:50:40,020 --> 08:50:41,140
um

7311
08:50:41,140 --> 08:50:46,980
Anyone who's supported the girls on patreon. I understand the patrons will have one audio and it's very kind of you to like

7312
08:50:47,620 --> 08:50:49,620
um

7313
08:50:49,620 --> 08:50:52,660
You know reach out and do that even there's literally one audio

7314
08:50:53,380 --> 08:50:57,300
There are coming because the audio is released on the first

7315
08:50:57,940 --> 08:51:02,500
The girls are gonna have a consistent day that their audio in particular comes out

7316
08:51:02,580 --> 08:51:05,300
I really hope this is counting towards the challenge actually

7317
08:51:06,660 --> 08:51:08,660
um

7318
08:51:09,700 --> 08:51:11,700
I think this

7319
08:51:11,940 --> 08:51:13,940
Grave I'm having to go all the way around

7320
08:51:22,260 --> 08:51:26,980
That was it right I just need to redo that and then I think that'll be it for the mission

7321
08:51:27,620 --> 08:51:30,100
For the the crotch is on

7322
08:51:31,060 --> 08:51:32,260
right, let me just

7323
08:51:32,260 --> 08:51:35,780
Check the DNA sequence. I say that as I literally just goes that

7324
08:51:36,500 --> 08:51:39,620
That should have counted quite a bit towards that one

7325
08:51:42,740 --> 08:51:44,740
Two

7326
08:51:47,460 --> 08:51:49,460
That came it is two

7327
08:51:51,620 --> 08:51:53,620
Oh

7328
08:51:54,820 --> 08:51:59,620
Why did that not work is it because I kept getting detected

7329
08:52:02,420 --> 08:52:04,420
Oh brother

7330
08:52:06,340 --> 08:52:08,340
Oh

7331
08:52:08,660 --> 08:52:12,500
Guards on horseback air so guards killed well on a horseback

7332
08:52:17,860 --> 08:52:19,860
PayPal guards I need to go all the way

7333
08:52:22,660 --> 08:52:26,900
Guards air assassinate from a beam actually we're closer to getting the thieves done

7334
08:52:28,340 --> 08:52:30,340
I need to find a beam. I don't know where the beam is

7335
08:52:30,980 --> 08:52:32,980
Yeah

7336
08:52:34,580 --> 08:52:36,980
The mercenaries one is like absolute killer

7337
08:52:37,860 --> 08:52:41,780
So you go patreoner just paid for you. Oh, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it

7338
08:52:43,860 --> 08:52:45,860
Y'all are I expected way more hate

7339
08:52:47,540 --> 08:52:52,100
Honestly, I think we all did but like I think everyone's just on the same page of like, yeah

7340
08:52:52,980 --> 08:52:58,660
You're probably tired at this point of like your vtuber just like teasing and teasing and then never giving anything

7341
08:52:59,540 --> 08:53:02,740
And then it's like, yeah, we're just having a good time meemen

7342
08:53:03,380 --> 08:53:06,740
If you want the goods, you know where they are. If you don't there's also free stuff coming out

7343
08:53:07,460 --> 08:53:09,460
a free video game coming out

7344
08:53:09,540 --> 08:53:11,540
like, uh, yeah

7345
08:53:11,860 --> 08:53:15,860
I think it probably helps without the greed out. I think if it was like a greedy

7346
08:53:16,340 --> 08:53:18,900
looking corporation that probably wouldn't help

7347
08:53:19,700 --> 08:53:21,700
but it's like, yeah, everyone's just

7348
08:53:22,740 --> 08:53:26,900
Right, I'm gonna bump into guards and they'd run away from them and hide in spots

7349
08:53:27,620 --> 08:53:28,660
Great

7350
08:53:28,660 --> 08:53:31,060
We'll do the bump because there's a hay bale right here

7351
08:53:31,780 --> 08:53:33,780
Hey, excuse me. Don't you be?

7352
08:53:33,780 --> 08:53:36,900
Oh sugar. Oh, uh, I don't think I can hide in this

7353
08:53:37,860 --> 08:53:40,420
Okay, let's see how

7354
08:53:41,780 --> 08:53:43,780
Can I hide now?

7355
08:53:45,860 --> 08:53:50,660
Oh, oh no, oh no, they're right next to me

7356
08:53:51,460 --> 08:53:57,860
No, don't check it. Don't check it. Don't check it. Don't check it. Don't check it

7357
08:54:01,380 --> 08:54:08,900
That shouldn't happen. Oh, there's more guards up here. I thought this district was like there's no guards here at all

7358
08:54:08,900 --> 08:54:10,900
Oh

7359
08:54:16,900 --> 08:54:18,900
Oh, yes the bench the bench of safety

7360
08:54:19,540 --> 08:54:24,260
Okay, I can't go on the bench because it's not like oh for goodness sake. How many of you?

7361
08:54:26,900 --> 08:54:29,460
Oh, right. I'm hiding in here can't get me

7362
08:54:33,220 --> 08:54:35,220
Does that count

7363
08:54:35,380 --> 08:54:40,180
Did it count you seem to be still annoyed at me?

7364
08:54:41,060 --> 08:54:43,460
I'm just gonna check that counted because if it does

7365
08:54:44,500 --> 08:54:50,820
Uh, not the poking if that did count. I'm literally just gonna keep upsetting those guards over and over to do that again and again

7366
08:54:52,820 --> 08:54:54,820
I think it should have counted those

7367
08:54:54,820 --> 08:55:00,820
I did right time to keep bumping into them. I'm gonna kill this guard up here though because he's gonna keep ruining it

7368
08:55:01,780 --> 08:55:03,780
Oh

7369
08:55:04,180 --> 08:55:06,180
Yeah

7370
08:55:22,260 --> 08:55:27,620
You smell so bad. No, you have to chase me

7371
08:55:30,820 --> 08:55:32,820
Miss me miss me now you have to kiss me

7372
08:55:34,580 --> 08:55:36,580
I was supposed to jump up

7373
08:55:40,660 --> 08:55:42,660
Where's the bail hey, oh there is

7374
08:55:52,500 --> 08:55:54,500
A six

7375
08:55:54,500 --> 08:55:56,500
Oh

7376
08:56:04,900 --> 08:56:06,900
I've got to get out of here

7377
08:56:17,140 --> 08:56:19,540
And then we just open dive into this again

7378
08:56:19,620 --> 08:56:21,620
Oh

7379
08:56:25,860 --> 08:56:30,980
I'm not sure that counted he was like so close you guys should know

7380
08:56:33,380 --> 08:56:39,860
No, I'm sorry, please excuse me. Ah, please excuse me. I'm scared. There's a table in the way. I got nervous. I'm sorry

7381
08:56:42,740 --> 08:56:45,140
Oh, no, I can't climb this way. Okay, he jumped on again

7382
08:56:45,380 --> 08:56:47,380
Ah

7383
08:56:47,700 --> 08:56:51,620
He's got a long lens. Please leave me alone. Let me out

7384
08:56:55,860 --> 08:56:57,860
Jump

7385
08:57:00,340 --> 08:57:04,340
They're like instantly given up. I'm like really worried that's not counting but

7386
08:57:09,060 --> 08:57:12,260
No, it is it just doesn't look like it looks so silly

7387
08:57:15,780 --> 08:57:18,980
And mercy online heck yeah mercies online. Let's go

7388
08:57:21,860 --> 08:57:23,620

7393
08:57:42,580 --> 08:57:44,580
Oh

7394
08:57:44,900 --> 08:57:46,900
See in the flip

7395
08:57:53,940 --> 08:57:55,940
Can you hear that or am I going crazy?

7396
08:57:59,940 --> 08:58:01,940
Am I going

7397
08:58:05,300 --> 08:58:10,340
Did I hear that right? Yeah, okay. I'm good. I was like, um, are you all hearing nothing?

7398
08:58:12,580 --> 08:58:14,580
Well, literally

7399
08:58:15,700 --> 08:58:20,180
I wonder if it's leftover ambience from the party sequence with the banker

7400
08:58:22,100 --> 08:58:24,100
Last one

7401
08:58:25,620 --> 08:58:27,620
Okay

7402
08:58:29,140 --> 08:58:33,380
I hear it again. Is there like people here or is it just SFX?

7403
08:58:35,860 --> 08:58:37,860
More like SFX

7404
08:58:38,660 --> 08:58:40,660
Yeah

7405
08:58:40,980 --> 08:58:44,260
Yeah, there's not even coded people to be here. I must just be background ambience

7406
08:58:45,300 --> 08:58:48,260
That's leftover from the party sequence with the bankers

7407
08:58:50,340 --> 08:58:54,020
All right, let's get notoriety down a little bit because guards are getting really worse

7408
08:58:56,260 --> 08:59:02,180
They're still asked it literally the party ended many a day ago. They just played operation

7409
08:59:02,740 --> 08:59:06,580
Hmm crazy, that's crazy right

7410
08:59:08,900 --> 08:59:13,940
I'm starting to get a bit delirious. Oh, I must switch the body though

7411
08:59:28,100 --> 08:59:30,100
I don't know why that did so little

7412
08:59:32,180 --> 08:59:34,180
I

7413
08:59:37,140 --> 08:59:44,100
Watching all the girls straight a long watch starting to move off isn't it not too much noise like there's too much noise going on

7414
08:59:48,340 --> 08:59:50,340
We're all blabbing away at once

7415
08:59:50,500 --> 09:00:03,060
I'm not sure what to do. I'm kind of getting I'm not like stuck. I know we can do those things

7416
09:00:03,220 --> 09:00:06,500
I'm just like, I don't know where the beam is for what we want to do

7417
09:00:09,940 --> 09:00:11,940
Um

7418
09:00:14,660 --> 09:00:16,820
I'm just like

7419
09:00:16,820 --> 09:00:19,540
Do we call it and then the next thing come on

7420
09:00:20,340 --> 09:00:25,780
I'm not gonna I like I'm like I'm saying to myself. I'm I'm gonna be annoyed at myself if I call it right now

7421
09:00:26,500 --> 09:00:27,700
is one

7422
09:00:27,700 --> 09:00:29,060
think I'm

7423
09:00:29,060 --> 09:00:31,060
I think I'm in back yet

7424
09:00:32,100 --> 09:00:34,100
Oh 19 seconds to come back

7425
09:00:36,580 --> 09:00:41,220
Right, let me find a group of thieves to hire at least so I can get rid of that

7426
09:00:45,140 --> 09:00:48,180
I can only focus it's hard to multitask that I'm watchable script right

7427
09:00:50,660 --> 09:00:53,700
But mercy live if anyone would like to watch mercy modis

7428
09:00:56,180 --> 09:01:01,300
Oh, I saw that. Okay, there are there are thieves somewhere on the verse up here

7429
09:01:05,220 --> 09:01:07,220
No

7430
09:01:07,220 --> 09:01:09,220
I see why they fear you

7431
09:01:11,860 --> 09:01:13,860
I'm forcing

7432
09:01:14,260 --> 09:01:16,260
Um

7433
09:01:16,500 --> 09:01:17,860
I

7434
09:01:17,860 --> 09:01:25,140
Think for simplicity will just teleport to the thieves guild in order to hire them. I struggle so much to find thieves

7435
09:01:25,140 --> 09:01:27,140
I understand their own rooftops

7436
09:01:27,220 --> 09:01:29,220
But they make it so freaking hard

7437
09:01:30,100 --> 09:01:31,700
run wads

7438
09:01:31,700 --> 09:01:34,500
Run wads of all six at once and let it just fry your brain

7439
09:01:35,860 --> 09:01:37,860
Most of it's four, but only one audio

7440
09:01:38,260 --> 09:01:43,380
Yeah, like I understand maybe for like a collab stream you like meet everyone but one person and then get to see everyone's POV

7441
09:01:46,740 --> 09:01:53,860
Mmm, I have teleport to the wrong place. I was not paying attention. I apologize. Oh wait, there's somewhere I can buy hello

7442
09:01:54,580 --> 09:01:56,580
Would you like to be purchased?

7443
09:02:00,180 --> 09:02:04,260
It would be a shame not to do Christina though like we're actually so close

7444
09:02:07,140 --> 09:02:09,140
Ah

7445
09:02:09,860 --> 09:02:12,020
What's the percentage we need for Christina?

7446
09:02:16,820 --> 09:02:18,820
Oh

7447
09:02:19,140 --> 09:02:22,340
Why is your accent so cool sponding Scotland?

7448
09:02:23,460 --> 09:02:24,900
and

7449
09:02:24,900 --> 09:02:26,900
always be scottish

7450
09:02:26,900 --> 09:02:30,740
It's very hard to unlearn that accent. Hmm. I even think it's possible

7451
09:02:32,740 --> 09:02:34,740
Truly out there now

7452
09:02:35,060 --> 09:02:40,660
Um, why was I here again? Oh to hire thieves and there's literally no thieves hanging out here

7453
09:02:41,300 --> 09:02:47,060
I need to hire one group of thieves. Is this for real for real like for real for real?

7454
09:02:49,780 --> 09:02:54,260
Uh, well, I need to find a beam that enemies pass over

7455
09:02:56,260 --> 09:03:00,420
And it's kind of in these general area. I'm uh

7456
09:03:03,700 --> 09:03:07,700
Unbelievably I'm at 69 percent. Um

7457
09:03:11,620 --> 09:03:13,460
Like

7458
09:03:13,460 --> 09:03:15,460
I don't know why

7459
09:03:15,540 --> 09:03:22,980
Locate memory in world insufficient data to access locate memory in world go to memory start point to synchronize with animals

7460
09:03:24,180 --> 09:03:26,180
Gotta go to work have fun at work

7461
09:03:26,820 --> 09:03:29,620
If you could have any other accent, what would it be?

7462
09:03:30,180 --> 09:03:32,180
Ah

7463
09:03:36,180 --> 09:03:43,060
Copernacle might have a lot of percentage in it. That's missing. We'll do Copernacle. Um as for accent

7464
09:03:48,500 --> 09:03:50,740
Can't imagine myself wearing her now. So honestly

7465
09:03:51,620 --> 09:03:53,620
Like to pick one

7466
09:03:53,620 --> 09:03:55,620
The Italian accent can be really nice

7467
09:03:55,940 --> 09:04:01,060
Although the Japanese like but Japanese voices are like so nice and like pitched

7468
09:04:02,180 --> 09:04:08,020
Um, which I really enjoy but I guess it's pitching no actual good boy

7469
09:04:11,860 --> 09:04:13,860
Uh

7470
09:04:13,940 --> 09:04:15,940
Her accent

7471
09:04:17,140 --> 09:04:19,700
Honestly, I don't actually mind

7472
09:04:20,340 --> 09:04:21,700
a

7473
09:04:21,700 --> 09:04:23,700
Polish accent if you've ever

7474
09:04:23,860 --> 09:04:28,340
Listen to a sweet Polish accent. It can actually be really soothing. Um

7475
09:04:29,780 --> 09:04:36,340
Just a little a little hint of uh their words and that's pretty good. Apply the Scottish accent to any language

7476
09:04:38,820 --> 09:04:40,820
Oh, you might apply to it

7477
09:04:43,780 --> 09:04:45,780
It calvane

7478
09:04:47,380 --> 09:04:49,380
It will sex

7479
09:04:49,620 --> 09:04:51,620
I

7480
09:04:51,940 --> 09:04:53,940
Was he believed

7481
09:04:55,780 --> 09:04:57,780
Volgmae

7482
09:04:58,180 --> 09:05:00,180
That's Scottish touch

7483
09:05:01,300 --> 09:05:03,300
That's pretty awful

7484
09:05:04,420 --> 09:05:11,140
Pretty rough pretty rough right. We'll try Copernacle, but if this doesn't like dramatically raise the DNA

7485
09:05:12,020 --> 09:05:14,500
Think I'm gonna I think I'm perishing

7486
09:05:16,420 --> 09:05:18,420
Unfortunately

7487
09:05:19,460 --> 09:05:21,460
And it might be wiser to

7488
09:05:22,020 --> 09:05:24,500
redirect into mercy and kind of have a break and

7489
09:05:25,140 --> 09:05:31,860
Deal with uh, these a smart collage and see what I'm looking at because I think someone might be waiting on me to edit

7490
09:05:40,020 --> 09:05:42,020
Scottish is the best accent as much as I was

7491
09:05:42,020 --> 09:05:49,380
Who is this man? He comes from Russia. I hear studies at the body count, but his words are unlike any that issue from that place

7492
09:05:50,580 --> 09:05:52,580
I don't buy it for Scottish accent's first

7493
09:05:53,540 --> 09:05:56,740
Scottish is magical hearing German speaking with songs that weird

7494
09:06:00,180 --> 09:06:03,380
You know, you have a good source accent when people can't even understand you

7495
09:06:03,940 --> 09:06:06,580
Perhaps to disguise a myriad of contradictions

7496
09:06:07,540 --> 09:06:13,620
I could use an excuse to go to bed. Yeah, I'm kind of like I think I'm actually lagging. I can't believe it. You're injured

7497
09:06:14,420 --> 09:06:19,700
Me saying I'm an endurance streamer. I'm a liar. The master wants all the scholars silence by nightfall

7498
09:06:19,940 --> 09:06:21,940
How long did we make it?

7499
09:06:22,980 --> 09:06:24,980
And so am I

7500
09:06:27,540 --> 09:06:30,660
Take no damage during the ambush right get the wee knife

7501
09:06:32,820 --> 09:06:34,820
Two minutes

7502
09:06:36,980 --> 09:06:38,980
Let's get to me nice

7503
09:06:40,500 --> 09:06:42,500
No

7504
09:06:42,500 --> 09:06:47,460
Yeah, that's what am I I'm gonna call in two of my assassins

7505
09:06:51,140 --> 09:06:54,660
No, it was like way too early that you saw the way he was wiggling that knife up

7506
09:06:58,660 --> 09:07:02,900
Whoa, why are you you know the guy that's like right in front of us maybe focus on like

7507
09:07:03,460 --> 09:07:05,460
Oh

7508
09:07:06,020 --> 09:07:08,020
Okay

7509
09:07:08,020 --> 09:07:13,060
Okay, my assassins are sticking around which I'm quite happy about I don't want to call in the last batch of assassins

7510
09:07:14,180 --> 09:07:16,180
just because

7511
09:07:19,460 --> 09:07:25,780
If they kill them too fast, they actually might all be spawned and not help me at all, which is quite funny to think about

7512
09:07:26,100 --> 09:07:32,980
I do wish citizens would stop running into the middle of the fight or near it. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Don't hurt me, please

7513
09:07:34,180 --> 09:07:36,180
If I take no damage, I win

7514
09:07:39,940 --> 09:07:41,380
Oh

7515
09:07:41,380 --> 09:07:46,820
I'm scared. He's got such a long freaking pole. He's gonna hit me with it

7516
09:07:50,980 --> 09:07:53,460
My assassin is trying to chase them but it's not happening

7517
09:07:56,340 --> 09:08:03,860
I'm just hiding. I'm letting my assassins do it. Copernico is fine. His health bar is fine

7518
09:08:08,340 --> 09:08:10,340
Oh, I've got fun. Oh, they caught me

7519
09:08:12,340 --> 09:08:21,700
Uh, I don't want to get hit. I'm so close to doing no hit. Please. Please. Please. Please. Literally 13 seconds is all I ask

7520
09:08:22,340 --> 09:08:26,100
Don't change up. Don't do anything else

7521
09:08:28,100 --> 09:08:30,100
Four more seconds

7522
09:08:31,700 --> 09:08:33,700
Okay, we did it

7523
09:08:34,100 --> 09:08:38,580
We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it

7524
09:08:38,740 --> 09:08:43,140
I think we came to do it. I'm still running away in case it counts. I think it counts

7525
09:08:43,220 --> 09:08:48,180
So I'm just gonna keep running running and running in circles around the fountain

7526
09:08:49,220 --> 09:08:51,220
Okay

7527
09:08:52,660 --> 09:08:56,340
Yeah, that's right. I did that

7528
09:09:09,460 --> 09:09:11,460
Right, I have terrible news

7529
09:09:11,940 --> 09:09:18,020
Fake endurance streamer. Absolutely horrible news 100% poggers. Yay. You said 100%

7530
09:09:18,020 --> 09:09:20,020
Wooo

7531
09:09:20,340 --> 09:09:25,700
Now we may genuinely return to brotherhood again at a later date. Um

7532
09:09:26,660 --> 09:09:31,060
But I'm actually quite satisfied. Literally, we did the campaign. We've done all the dlc stuff now

7533
09:09:32,340 --> 09:09:34,500
You did that so hard that other people didn't

7534
09:09:36,980 --> 09:09:38,980
Strolling it if you don't finish it just

7535
09:09:39,700 --> 09:09:44,260
Means you need to do it. Yes. I actually wouldn't mind revisiting it at a later date

7536
09:09:44,260 --> 09:09:49,620
I would like to play a bit more variety at this point. Um, I'm going to redirect into

7537
09:09:50,420 --> 09:09:51,780
um

7538
09:09:51,780 --> 09:09:53,780
Mercy so we can all enjoy her

7539
09:09:54,340 --> 09:09:58,100
I I can't believe it. I'm not a real endurance streamer. I only lasted

7540
09:09:58,820 --> 09:10:04,180
Nine hours this time. Gee willacrus. Oh, I'm kind of basic

7541
09:10:05,060 --> 09:10:07,060
I can't believe it

7542
09:10:08,020 --> 09:10:10,020
Oh

7543
09:10:10,100 --> 09:10:16,180
Uh, please do consider giving a like and a subscribe. Uh, if you enjoyed youtube may have unscripted

7544
09:10:17,620 --> 09:10:21,140
But don't worry. Uh, I'm going to redirect you an emergency

7545
09:10:22,740 --> 09:10:24,740
An emergency

7546
09:10:26,100 --> 09:10:32,900
Uh, redirect select stream. Oh, she's playing. Oh morey. Oh morey

7547
09:10:34,020 --> 09:10:36,020
That's oh morey

7548
09:10:36,740 --> 09:10:38,260
When

7549
09:10:38,260 --> 09:10:39,860
mercy, please

7550
09:10:39,860 --> 09:10:41,860
The tippy tippy day

7551
09:10:43,620 --> 09:10:45,620
That's pretty good. Yeah, that's pretty good

7552
09:10:56,260 --> 09:11:01,060
I got a copyright on my assassin's creed playthrough a game yesterday

7553
09:11:01,860 --> 09:11:08,100
Uh, sorry, I just spotted that right now and I'm like, uh, what I apologize. Uh, thank you

7554
09:11:08,580 --> 09:11:11,300
So so much my lovely beeflings for watching

7555
09:11:12,020 --> 09:11:16,100
Um, literally, I just I just checked it out. I'm like, I'm pretty sure the game has no copyright

7556
09:11:16,260 --> 09:11:21,300
So it's a false copyright thing going on. But thank you so so much for hanging out. Uh,

7557
09:11:22,100 --> 09:11:25,780
Yeah, maybe not 100 for the first time, but we'll give it a shot

7558
09:11:25,780 --> 09:11:28,660
I think we'll come back and we'll feel refreshed at a later date

7559
09:11:29,060 --> 09:11:33,460
Um, because that was a lot of jumping about. I think that's brought 20 hours

7560
09:11:34,100 --> 09:11:40,260
Combined at this point. Um, so thank you so so much for hanging. Uh, tomorrow we're playing needy streamer overload

7561
09:11:40,340 --> 09:11:42,340
I haven't played it

7562
09:11:42,500 --> 09:11:45,460
So i'm not quite sure what to expect but is a shorter stream for me

7563
09:11:46,020 --> 09:11:51,780
Um, so for those of you like the endurance side of things, I apologize, but my stamina is lacking tomorrow

7564
09:11:52,180 --> 09:11:55,940
Um, but nevertheless is always fantastic. Thank you so so much

7565
09:11:56,420 --> 09:12:00,180
My little reeflings or those who are watching and I will

7566
09:12:01,380 --> 09:12:05,220
See you tomorrow and say hi to mersey. I will talk

7567
09:12:05,380 --> 09:12:09,940
I will talk in mersey's chat for a little bit, but uh, I do need to go for a big pee

7568
09:12:10,260 --> 09:12:12,900
Um, I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise and you may pass

7569
09:12:13,540 --> 09:12:16,040
So I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye. Bye

7570
09:12:16,040 --> 09:12:18,040
Bye

7571
09:12:22,760 --> 09:12:24,760
Bye. Bye now see you tomorrow
