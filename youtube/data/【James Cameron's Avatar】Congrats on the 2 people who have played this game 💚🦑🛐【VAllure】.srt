1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,240
I was trying to speedrun up in the stream started and the game.

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,720
This game crashes so heckin' easily and it literally just crashed there.

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
Praying it works.

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Praying it works.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,720
But good morning, good evening, and good afternoon.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,720
Oui, today my screen has gone black so hopefully I'm still streaming.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,720
Oh my god.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,720
Right, this game breaks.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,720
Oh, I think it's about to break again.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
No way.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
Oh, this game breaks so easily.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Oh, don't break, don't break.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,720
Oh, my screen's black again.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,720
What?

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,720
This game breaks so easily.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,720
I think this is like 2007 maybe?

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
But goodness me.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Oui, we are playing yet again, surprise surprise, another childhood game.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Wait, what?

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,720
Oh, it's 2009.

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,720
It says James Cameron's Avatar game 2009.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:32,720
So I played this game as a little sheriff and is there a girl that's white with black hair?

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Well, I'm not blonde.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm not.

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Well, we just did that.

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Right, we're blonde with green eyes today.

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Yippee.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
So this game.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,720
Okay, now let's enter first name.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Squiddles.

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Squiddly.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm feeling a bit squiddly-diddly the day about.

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,720
I had no idea they even released the game back then.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Oh, this game is, I wrote.

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,720
I'll shush until the campaign part, but they much to the campaign.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Let me, it got slapped together.

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Let me tell you that much.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
I got slapped together.

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,720
So I am a big enthusiast of Avatar.

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,720
I absolutely enjoy the movies to the highest of heavens.

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Cut.

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Oh my God, I've not played this in years.

45
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Oh, look, it's us.

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Sigourney Weaver.

47
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
Big Sigourney Weaver, where you been?

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
We've missed you, Sigourney.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Don't screw up.

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Got it.

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,720
This has not stood up to the test of time, graphics-wise.

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
My neck be bending.

53
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
My armpit textures are warped.

54
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Oh, AC and Snow Berries.

55
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Hi.

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
How was your puzzle game, AC?

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
I watched you in the bath.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Oh, this is really weird.

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,720
I was in the bath and I was like, I'm sure AC should be on right now.

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,720
And I opened up the game and you were like, this is a child's game.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,720
How can I do this?

62
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
I thought I could do this because I think someone said,

63
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
why did you pick this game first?

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Snow Berry Raid.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Yeah, there was like a big whale with loads of ropes all over it.

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,720
And I was like, I've never seen this game in my life.

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm too dumb.

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Did you not finish it?

69
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Was it like a finished game or was it like one of those ones where it's like,

70
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
you just play for fun?

71
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Is Sheevee's fault?

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Sheevee, what did you do?

73
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
She put the ropes in.

74
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Oh, that's very good.

75
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Oh, you finished it.

76
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Let's go.

77
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
AC Smart.

78
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
AC Smart.

79
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
AC Smart.

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Hell's Gate.

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Kendra.

82
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Congrats if your name's Kendra.

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay, so we are playing an RDA soldier.

84
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Boots on the ground.

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
We are a signal specialist, okay?

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
We've just arrived at Hell's Gate,

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,720
which is where the humans have landed on the Navi's home planet, basically.

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,720
And the way that we humans survive is by sectioning off areas of Pandora,

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
because Pandora is so aggressive and dangerous.

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Wendy, yes.

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
The big blue ladies.

92
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Soon, soon.

93
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Hold on, hold on.

94
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
You've never seen the movie before?

95
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Okay.

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
How do you even summarize Avatar?

97
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Just watch yourself around, Dr. Monroe.

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,720
He treats the avatars like his own personal guinea pigs.

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
This is a very old game,

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,720
and it is not a fair, like, assessment of what this game's about.

101
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
However.

102
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
However, however, however.

103
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Too long didn't read.

104
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Blue people good?

105
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Humans bad?

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Capitalism bad?

107
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Being nice to the environment?

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Good!

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
That's it.

110
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
That's all you have to know.

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
That's all you have to know.

112
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,720
You have completely caught up to the Avatar franchise,

113
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
as we know right now.

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Bojinga, I think.

115
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Brian?

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Not me getting Brian back on the HUD.

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Thank you so much, Bojinga, for the 13, I appreciate it.

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
I'm looking forward to this stream of this game that literally no one has played.

119
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
I wish I could do a poll right now,

120
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
but if I back out of this game,

121
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
it crashes super easily,

122
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
so basically,

123
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I don't even know if I'm going for a toilet break today.

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,720
I looked it up and it said apparently the campaign mode is...

125
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
8 hours, but I don't believe it.

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Yes.

127
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
We're at signal specialist.

128
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I didn't even know there was an avatar.

129
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Well, there's a new avatar game now, but we're playing the old-

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Let me take a sip of my honey tea today.

131
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Aloha.

132
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Did you guys watch Mercy's ASMR?

133
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Congrats to Mercy!

134
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Mojie's been the only member of Euler to not get her VOD taken down

135
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,720
and leave a warning on her channel for sexual misconduct.

136
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Give it up for Mercy!

137
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Oh my God.

138
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Let's go, Mercy!

139
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I am so nervous for my ASMR stream

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
because I had planned something a bit special for it.

141
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
And...

142
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
YouTube are dancing with all of us right now.

143
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Sorry, I'll get over the cutscenes first.

144
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,720
We get to experience being in a navi body for the first time.

145
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
If you haven't played, or don't know,

146
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,720
you enter a booth which neural links you to an actual navi body.

147
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Don't look too much into it.

148
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,720
It's pretty fantasy-based and all that jazz, but yeah.

149
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,720
We are now in navi, we have access to a navi body,

150
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
but we are still RDA.

151
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
RDA's the bad guys.

152
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Boo! Boo! RDA!

153
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Navi! Yay! Navi! Yay!

154
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
But RDA, boo!

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Go.

156
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Oh my God, that neck!

157
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
That's killing me.

158
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
She looks like a giraffe.

159
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Let me get over this bed real quick.

160
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
So we have just been introduced to our avatar body.

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Navi body.

162
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
RDA mission complete.

163
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
So yes, this is a much older game.

164
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
We're just...

165
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
So we are about to...

166
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Anyway.

167
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
She's pampering us.

168
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
It looks good for its age.

169
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Honestly!

170
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
So the newest avatar, I haven't had an...

171
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Oh!

172
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Brian!

173
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Bero, thank you for the 20.

174
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Would you guys neural link with me?

175
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Like, if you could go to bed, like, you see everything from APOV?

176
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Would that...

177
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Would I still be in control at that point?

178
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Or would you want to control me?

179
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Or would you want me to control you?

180
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Do you really need to ask?

181
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't know if you want to see my POV.

182
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
You just, like, dine and be really disappointed that I don't have big boobs.

183
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Does the nicotine patch interfere with the process?

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Nah, you can leave it on.

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,720
If anything, it makes it better when you're in.

186
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,720
So this is the reason we are in Pandora, the world.

187
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
You see those purple things underneath?

188
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Those are the resources we mine from this planet for capitalism back on Earth.

189
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
It is crazy.

190
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Honestly, I get to pray.

191
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Hard to believe you're finally here.

192
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
A-turn!

193
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Oop!

194
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
They're purple.

195
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
The resources are purple.

196
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
A big butt better than Big Boa.

197
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
We're here to get the blue oil.

198
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Did someone say oil?

199
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
By the dawn, sparely.

200
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Did I tell you?

201
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
In a voice chat,

202
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,720
I sung that, but I only know the first two lines.

203
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,720
And then freakin' Sheevie and Azura burst out into singing like the actual thing.

204
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
And I was like, oh my god, this is really...

205
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,720
I was getting serenaded by the dawn,

206
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
sparely.

207
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
I once prayed.

208
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
I don't know the words at all.

209
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
And I don't know why it's so hard.

210
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Like, why does it go high?

211
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Did you guys see my Twitter post about how much I got scammed on American sweets?

212
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Hello!

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
So these are just basic transporters,

214
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
but as you can see, this is the whole map of Pandora.

215
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
We will unlock a few more locations soon,

216
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
but there's not really much detail to it.

217
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
We're currently at Hell's Gate.

218
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
We are going to get flown to Blue Lagoon,

219
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
but as you can see, this Earth is healthy.

220
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,720
There's lots of blues and greens and all that.

221
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
It's a nice, healthy Earth.

222
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Blue Lagoon.

223
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Open the game...

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Oh, that's just the information thing.

225
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
I thought I was going to explain what Blue Lagoon is.

226
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Blue Lagoon is where a lot of the navi

227
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
that are controlled by the RDA-side hangout

228
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,720
and a few of the tribes are tolerant to our behaviors.

229
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Our human activities.

230
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,720
So this is Tutorial Island, essentially.

231
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I thought this game was a fever dream.

232
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
It's real!

233
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Hi, Stony. I remember playing this game as a kid.

234
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Congrats, you're one of the two people

235
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
who have played this game that's watching right now.

236
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
A very, very underground game.

237
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
I'll tell you a very fun factoid about this game.

238
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
So obviously, I was an Xbox kid.

239
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,720
If you were able to obtain a copy of the special...

240
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Oh, I loved that little animation.

241
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
This was probably before motion capture was even a thing

242
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
because what the heck was that?

243
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Our encounter with Pandora's wildlife.

244
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
These are Viperwills.

245
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
They're terrifying.

246
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
But their designs are so good.

247
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,720
The animal designs are freaking amazing.

248
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I am needing to remember.

249
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
That's to analyze.

250
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Okay, so we have freaking special abilities.

251
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,720
For some reason, I can go and visit and shit.

252
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
But you can level up and progress

253
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
and make these abilities way stronger.

254
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
But literally, it's pretty insane.

255
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,720
The game's got loads of things going for it.

256
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,720
So right now, we're just defending the perimeter

257
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,720
from what way the game isn't too loud.

258
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
I cannot adjust the volume without breaking it.

259
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,720
We're just defending the perimeter from...

260
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Oh, I almost just shot our own guy there.

261
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Is it working?

262
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Okay, there we go.

263
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
You do get XP.

264
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
There is a level-up system in this game as well.

265
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
I am so bad at aiming.

266
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Holy crap, I don't remember it being this hard as a child.

267
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Child Me is like so much better gamer

268
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
when it comes to this stuff, honestly.

269
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Lollipop model confirmed

270
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
we're doing some reward.

271
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Because, actually, why am I so much better at this game?

272
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I know they spawn over there a lot.

273
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Okay, objective complete.

274
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Love to see you play the game,

275
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,720
but I will be very happy for every Navi I see die.

276
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
For the RDA for humanity.

277
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
You're joking.

278
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
You picked the RDA?

279
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Who are you?

280
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Iron Reaper?

281
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
You picked the freaking...

282
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Why would you prick?

283
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Oh, I literally just had a Freudian slip

284
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
and called you a prick there.

285
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Why would you pick?

286
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
This is not the Navi.

287
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Thank you for the 50.

288
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
That's insane.

289
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Thank you for the 50.

290
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Grab a buggy and help him out.

291
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
But you're wrong.

292
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
RDA Supremacy.

293
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Reef Flames?

294
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,720
We're here for nature

295
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
and to be nice to wildlife.

296
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
I'm literally a cuttlefish.

297
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Are you saying...

298
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Oh, is this Halo Controls?

299
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
No, kind of.

300
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
You can be attacked when you go out,

301
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
but I will say one thing.

302
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
The motion sickness.

303
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Merci.

304
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
If you're lurking, do not watch this.

305
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,720
This motion sickness on the vehicles is insane.

306
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Oh, we're doing hit and runs.

307
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
We're doing hit and runs.

308
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Get wrecked.

309
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Oh, right.

310
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
I missed that, but whatever.

311
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Oh, I can't remember much.

312
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
There is going to be...

313
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
This guy should...

314
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
There is like aim assist in this game.

315
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
So if you're bad at video games,

316
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
please don't worry.

317
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
If you ever think you might want to

318
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
get this game a shot.

319
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
You're a lifesaver.

320
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,720
This game is giving commands for keyboard,

321
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,720
but that's because...

322
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Wait, wait, wait.

323
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Butt bounce.

324
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Wait, where the heck did it go?

325
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,720
I'm fighting.

326
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Oh, we're going to stick them out to go down.

327
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Oh, come on.

328
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
You can tell Kale as well,

329
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
which is really good in this game.

330
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
This game is definitely for people

331
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
who are not very...

332
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
I would say if you're new to gaming,

333
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,720
the game is very friendly to you.

334
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
I say that as I literally am forgetting

335
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,720
all the spawn locations of the enemies right now.

336
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,720
These are Viper Wolves.

337
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Literally waiting until this game gets so beautiful.

338
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
I wish...

339
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,720
I don't know what the new avatar game is like genuinely about.

340
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I heard those growls.

341
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I heard that.

342
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,720
I have gamer sense, okay?

343
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Oh, there's another one.

344
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Jeez.

345
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Whoa.

346
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
My trigger just got stuck there.

347
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Are you squidding me right now?

348
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Glory to humanity and cuttlefish.

349
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Down with the navi.

350
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,720
No, the navi are the good guys.

351
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Slice Saber?

352
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
How dare you?

353
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Thank you for the tip.

354
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
But the navi are the good guys.

355
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,720
We're supposed to protect humanity, okay?

356
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Right, so we're currently saving

357
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
the current signal thing or something.

358
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
I don't know.

359
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Tutorial.

360
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
We are doing tutorial, but I'm just spamming through it

361
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
because I want to be navi.

362
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Just to be those dogs.

363
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Everyone's literally so beefed up in this game for no reason.

364
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Wait, you say navi's good guys.

365
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Protect humanity.

366
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
The navi are the big blue ones.

367
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
The big blue ones protect nature.

368
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
We protect nature, okay?

369
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
We...

370
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

371
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
You ready for this?

372
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
We...

373
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,720
You want to protect nature, little reform.

374
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
You want to be a good boy for humanity.

375
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
You want to recycle where physically possible.

376
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
But we understand...

377
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Oh, wait.

378
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
If the RDA are the bad guys, then why are their mechs so cool?

379
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Checkmate, tree huggers.

380
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Uh...

381
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
The rea...

382
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Well, I'm gonna show you me absolutely wrecking

383
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
and fricking decking those mechs.

384
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,720
There's no way you guys are genuinely picking the human side.

385
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Doomsday, Dan, you're getting a spank,

386
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
but thanks for the tip.

387
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
And Beijing got again.

388
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
No, you're wrong.

389
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
You have to be nice.

390
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
If I have to hit me...

391
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Tree huggers!

392
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
If that makes me a tree hugger,

393
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
then guess what?

394
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I'll proudly identify myself as a tree humper.

395
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Oh, I just got...

396
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Oh, I'm getting...

397
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I'm getting...

398
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
I'm getting ganged up on.

399
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
I'm getting ganged up on.

400
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Literally, the bark is peeling off from how hard

401
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I'm humping the wildlife right now, okay?

402
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Because...

403
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm not...

404
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
I'm not...

405
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Oh, um...

406
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
This is so much easier as a child.

407
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Hello, child, me.

408
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Can you just, like...

409
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I don't know, possess my body right now?

410
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Because why am I getting wrecked and decked?

411
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
There's...

412
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Uh...

413
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Oh, for goodness sake, wait, wait, wait, wait.

414
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
I'm getting wrecked.

415
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm getting wrecked.

416
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
What'd you get?

417
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Tim...

418
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
What the heck?

419
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Tim Shuttle?

420
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Tim Shuttle?

421
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Your name is literally Cuttlefish.

422
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
A little Shuttlefish.

423
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Glory to the hip, no toad.

424
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Protect the Navi and the sea star.

425
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
See, Tim knows exactly what he's on about.

426
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Thank you, Tim.

427
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
At least some of us have since...

428
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Right.

429
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
You've got me there.

430
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
You've got me a wee bit there.

431
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Hold on, hold on.

432
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
But give him a chance.

433
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Give him a chance.

434
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Thank you, Otter Von Biscuit.

435
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Damn right you only sent for Cuttlefish.

436
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
We the best out here.

437
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Wait, I just realized.

438
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,720
I think I'm supposed to drive the car in here.

439
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Oh, I think I'm about to get attacked.

440
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Or maybe those guys are protecting me.

441
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
I'm not sure.

442
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
There we go.

443
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Run that, logist!

444
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
Oh!

445
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
See, you have level up system.

446
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Um, I have terrible news for you.

447
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,720
If you want to do survival of the fittest, no weapons.

448
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Absolutely.

449
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Goodness.

450
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Is this...?

451
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Ah!

452
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Take this!

453
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Fart Bomb.

454
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Thank you very much.

455
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Sarge, IBW.

456
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
What a unique...

457
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Thank you.

458
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Thank you very much for the tip.

459
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Sorry, Strony, but I'll never trust a species at...

460
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Look.

461
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
All I'm seeing is give tentacles a chance.

462
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I might be getting a little tentacle addition here and there, you know?

463
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Am I going the wrong way?

464
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
It looks like I'm going the wrong way on the map.

465
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
I've not been here before.

466
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Oh my goodness, the camera angle.

467
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Look, the game aged all right.

468
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm not going to say it aged well.

469
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Wait, is there a little path back here?

470
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
No, there's not.

471
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
It's a lie.

472
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
It's a lie.

473
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
It's up here.

474
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Oh my goodness, this camera angle is horrific!

475
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,720
I'm getting sick of myself.

476
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Let me in!

477
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Let me in!

478
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
I'm human!

479
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
What are you doing?

480
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Okay, I actually have to go backwards?

481
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Jeez.

482
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Thank you.

483
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Not Alessandro as well.

484
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Rules of nature, survival...

485
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Yeah, no.

486
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Oh my goodness!

487
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Wait!

488
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Oh my God!

489
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Lady driver moment!

490
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Please!

491
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Camera angle!

492
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Please!

493
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Jeez!

494
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Louise!

495
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Let me work here!

496
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
My goodness!

497
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
This is awful!

498
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Why is the camera...

499
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Oh my God!

500
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
This is horrific!

501
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Are you kidding me right now?

502
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Oh, thank God.

503
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
I don't get emotions like in the video games.

504
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Do you not expect the message to work this time long?

505
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Anyways, have fun, stroney and dreams.

506
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Brian's back!

507
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,720
So when you tip, you can actually, like, act in here and you can hear it.

508
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Thank you again for the another tip, Alessandro!

509
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
Eh, bitches.

510
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
When you tip, you will never be read out.

511
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Oh my God, that camera angle is horrific.

512
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Please.

513
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Do not ever make me drive one of those again.

514
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Thank you.

515
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Oh, goodness me.

516
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Right.

517
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
What is the heck is this?

518
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
I've forgotten.

519
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Oh, it's a teleport pod.

520
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Okay.

521
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
You can teleport between the different regions.

522
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,720
So this is all the Blue Lagoon areas.

523
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Oh my God!

524
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
This is awesome!

525
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Oh my God!

526
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
That camera angle is horrific.

527
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Please.

528
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
This is all the Blue Lagoon area.

529
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,720
But as you can see, there's one, two, three, four, five.

530
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Why are the teleport points all at the bottom and only one at the top?

531
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Eh, I see how it is.

532
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Make a mirror walk everywhere.

533
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Okay, a little sip of my tea.

534
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Have you played it?

535
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Are you sure you've played this before?

536
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
The accusations?

537
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
I'm not beating the accusations.

538
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Right, I'm going to finish my tea before it gets too cold.

539
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Mmm.

540
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm delicious.

541
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
I like the reverb effect on the verb.

542
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,720
I mean, I don't want to ruin anything, but that's definitely may or may not happen in

543
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
a certain ASMR stream.

544
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,720
I like freaking changed the title of the ASMR stream because I don't know what is going

545
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
on.

546
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Everyone's getting warnings left, right and center.

547
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Now don't get me wrong.

548
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Any jumping up and doing on the bed is quite humorous, okay?

549
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
And I don't know, did she be actually doing anything that was that wrong?

550
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Now the only reason I will say Azura had received that warning was on the pure basis.

551
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Her voice is just like honey.

552
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Her voice is the sun embracing you after a few days of rain.

553
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Her voice is like that hug you have needed for years and you just let it all out and

554
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,720
you feel like her.

555
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:25,720
However, the other side of the coin for Azura's voice is it won't go down.

556
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
It can't stay down.

557
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,720
There's no such thing as a refractory period to her when you listen to her voice.

558
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Maybe you'll get 10 minutes a piece at max.

559
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
You know what I'm saying?

560
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,720
So I kind of get why she got a warning.

561
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I don't think she'd be got a warning because she was wise enough to private it.

562
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
I don't know.

563
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,720
I don't know if she did delete that.

564
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Did she do ear licking?

565
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Oh goodness me.

566
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Can't even do a ear licking.

567
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
I don't know what's going on because people that show their face are still uploading all

568
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
fine and dandy.

569
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,720
So I think there might be a H-E-N update to the tie.

570
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Possibly pop stealth policy.

571
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Oh god, not the camera angle again.

572
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm currently driving with one hand so this is going to go absolutely awful.

573
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
But look how big Pandora is.

574
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
It's fantastic.

575
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,720
One hand steering whilst I drink my tea.

576
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,720
I'm like a real contractor honestly.

577
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Look, I'm just here to do the contract work.

578
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm not here to do anything special.

579
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I get paid on the day.

580
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Okay, driving isn't actually that bad right?

581
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Let's speed up.

582
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Let's go.

583
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Let's see if two handed.

584
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
I'm even worse probably.

585
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Oh, I'm hitting the land.

586
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
I'm doing the Titanic.

587
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Titanic momentum.

588
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,720
I am played this game when I was young and when I tell people about it, they never believe

589
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
it's real.

590
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Also for the Navi, support nature.

591
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Yes, thank you.

592
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Thank you for the tip, Kitsune.

593
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Gaming today.

594
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Literally, I don't think I've really met anyone that's heard about this hecking game.

595
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
But I'm glad that a few of you actually have played it.

596
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Okay, I'm just unlocking teleport stations when I do that.

597
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Hi, hi everyone joining.

598
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
We're playing Avatar.

599
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
James Cameron's Avatar.

600
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Some people thought it was Avatar, the last airbender related.

601
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
No, no, no, no, no.

602
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Not at all.

603
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Although, I think Amy might be doing a watch along that if you're into watch longs.

604
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Please do think about supporting your local neighborhood little sister because she may

605
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
be doing a watch along that a little bit.

606
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm going to take a little sipping tune of my cola.

607
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
I need to hydrate.

608
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Now I get to ramble about all the work I did yesterday.

609
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Okay, so the update is...

610
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Are you squidding me right now?

611
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Unless...

612
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Brian!

613
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Gaming in one hand while she stronts the cuddles in the other.

614
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
It's more difficult than you think.

615
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Not that I'd know.

616
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,720
Honestly, thank you for the tip.

617
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Tharja.

618
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Tharja, I feel like that's not how you're supposed to pronounce it.

619
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Are you Swedish and it's Tharja?

620
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Tharja?

621
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,720
A little bit of a Swedish moment.

622
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Look, it's that guy we saved in that cave only a few minutes ago.

623
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
What kind of cola?

624
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Just cola cola.

625
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Is it called Coke Zero when it's got the no sugar?

626
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
I finally went no sugar on the cola.

627
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Aspartame.

628
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
I can finally tolerate aspartame.

629
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,720
It is that thing that is in the drinks to make it sugar-free.

630
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,720
But I was like, I don't mind having a big badonk-a-donk,

631
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
but I don't want it to get too big.

632
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
So I'm now drinking aspartame,

633
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,720
which apparently gives rats cancer.

634
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
So it's not looking good for us mammals.

635
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
But hey, oh, you got to die something.

636
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,720
And, you know, I'm not going out without enjoying myself.

637
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
That's all I'm saying on that much.

638
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Right.

639
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,720
There are vapor wheels here, so please excuse the combat.

640
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Boom.

641
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,720
Now you can just came to do this,

642
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,720
but it does bring you out of fricking invisibility.

643
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
Get in the boat, get in the boat, drive away, drive away.

644
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Yeah, see, they get scared of my little fart bomb.

645
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,720
Actually, I think it's called a supersonic wave

646
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
and they don't like the noise, which makes sense.

647
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
You know, nature doesn't like loud noises.

648
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Can relate on a physiological...

649
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Physiological?

650
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
No, not physiological.

651
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Oh, now you can just skip quite a bit of combat if you're cheeky,

652
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
but only if you're smart enough to do the things in the correct timing.

653
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
I'm going to heal up.

654
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,720
You can heal up naturally and it just means gentle for time.

655
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,720
As I said, this game is super forgiving to new gamers.

656
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,720
If you are into kind of that fantasy element, then...

657
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Am I to walk from here?

658
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I can't walk from here.

659
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Nature doesn't like loud noises.

660
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Literally the loudest of nature.

661
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,720
The sea bomb or a big badonka?

662
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Those are the two choices.

663
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I don't want to...

664
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
I don't mind getting too big.

665
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
No, sorry, I do mind getting too big.

666
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
You know, you got to keep that pear shape on.

667
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
You know, like when I do that hand cam stream,

668
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,720
everyone's going to know the real size of my chest.

669
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Yes, I will teach you all the strats of this game.

670
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
For those who are wondering,

671
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
is this an adjourned stream?

672
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,720
This is roughly a seven hour stream.

673
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,720
So do feel free to stream yourself for the full seven hours.

674
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
If not, then the seven hour stream.

675
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Roughly.

676
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,720
I believe we will actually successfully catch Mercy for a redirect

677
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,720
if my humble Mercy is streaming today, which I believe she is.

678
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720
As always, if any of my gen mates come online,

679
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,720
please remind me and I will tell those who would much prefer to watch

680
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,720
a game that isn't archaic or whatever they're doing on stream.

681
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,720
We're supposed to for seven hours.

682
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,720
I feel like that would hurt.

683
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,720
But anyway, because I cannot tell you how strange it was

684
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,720
to go offline after two hours,

685
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
it literally felt like, what do we do now?

686
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Oh, now we play the game.

687
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Because I was like, wait, I have so much time and yeah.

688
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,720
So I've got three more ASMR collabs on the way.

689
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
I did a little bit of socializing.

690
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
We are now Navi.

691
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,720
We're about to do some Navi questlines.

692
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,720
But please remember, we are RDA Navi.

693
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,720
To use teleportations, we use the tree of vision.

694
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
It's very important to get those because my goodness,

695
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
it makes travel so much easier.

696
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Look how tall we are and the camera angle has changed

697
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
and is much more favorable.

698
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,720
I prefer when video games have a really pooled out third perspective camera.

699
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,720
If the camera is two centimeters away from my face, I do not like it.

700
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I find it very hard to look at.

701
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,720
I don't know if that's because I need glasses

702
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,720
and I still haven't trained myself to wear glasses.

703
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Very bad girl, bad girl, very naughty.

704
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,720
But I think that my preference in video games is a zoom out angle.

705
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,720
It might be related to that because, yeah.

706
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,720
But hey, does anyone know the full name of the game and it's on Steam?

707
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,720
I don't even know if it's on Steam.

708
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,720
It is called James Cameron's Avatar.

709
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Okay, the Navi can go through these doors.

710
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Nope, only when they're green.

711
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Okay, sure, sure.

712
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
We are about to encounter the wildlife.

713
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,720
They will still attack us even if we are Navi and RDA does not matter.

714
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Where the heck am I going?

715
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
I'm going the wrong way.

716
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
That's why I'm getting turned around.

717
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Now, again, we do have superpowers.

718
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
We have sprint.

719
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
We have invincibility.

720
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,720
We have health and we have ground smash, which is very good.

721
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,720
In order to get healing, if you look on when that health bar comes up again,

722
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,720
you'll notice the number zero at the bottom left on the right side of the health bar that appears bottom left.

723
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,720
The more cell samples we pick up, the more second chances we have.

724
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Now, it's very common to run out of health in this game.

725
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,720
It's just the thing that happens.

726
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
It's not a big deal.

727
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Again, the game's very forgiving.

728
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,720
You can literally do this all the way through the game and anything can hardly hit you.

729
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,720
But the later sections of the game, I don't know if there weren't many playtesters

730
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,720
because it was very rough in the later sections of the game.

731
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
I have to admit, it's getting pretty rough.

732
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,720
We are going to unlock this Tree of Vision, so now we can teleport to this region

733
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,720
when we come back to 100% the region.

734
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
You must be rider.

735
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Let's get you up to speed.

736
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
How many games do you have lined up?

737
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
My apologies.

738
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Do you mean to play in general?

739
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:45,720
If you mean games overall, like daily streaming games for a year?

740
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Question mark.

741
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Next week in endurance is Skyrim.

742
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
It's another childhood game of mine.

743
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:00,720
I used to do 100% achievements in Skyrim every year because I really appreciate the game and its vanilla form.

744
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
I do apologize if you like mods, but I don't know what to say.

745
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Now we're among friends.

746
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,720
We aren't friends, so you need to learn quick.

747
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
We aren't friends?

748
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Figure that out.

749
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Would you guys, you know, would you guys really view?

750
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
What? 100?

751
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
You are one cool gal.

752
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Fell in love when you started playing all my favorite games.

753
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Also humans number one baby.

754
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
No!

755
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
I used to tactical strike every navi, every chance I got.

756
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Anonymous!

757
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
No!

758
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Bad boy!

759
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Bad boy!

760
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Thank you for the 100.

761
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
That's a lot of money though.

762
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Please make sure you're looking after yourself and treating yourself.

763
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
100 is a lot.

764
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Jesus.

765
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Bad and on.

766
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Bad boy.

767
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Come get spankens right now.

768
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Bad.

769
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Let me take a sipping tin.

770
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Are you squiddin' me right now?

771
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Goodness me.

772
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Can't believe the reflings are betraying mama like this.

773
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
SMH.

774
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Exactly, Nero.

775
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Don't worry though, strongy.

776
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
I'll never betray nature.

777
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Must protect the navi.

778
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Exactly, we stand nature in this house.

779
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
We will look after nature.

780
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,720
As you see me, you can literally hear me dancing about in my chair right now.

781
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,720
So we are, what the heck is that zone?

782
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
And why is it so big?

783
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Oh, we're plant sampling.

784
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Okay, this is tutorial section.

785
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
When I explained, thank you for the tip again, Nero.

786
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Anonymous, my goodness, that was a lot of money.

787
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Play, is something attacking me?

788
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
No.

789
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,720
When you pick up cell samples, there's that little white bar on the left side.

790
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I didn't, and you thought there was enemies because I was like, why am I getting, playing

791
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
as an avatar?

792
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:54,720
As an avatar, pondora's flora, which means flowers, and fauna means animals.

793
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Yes.

794
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,720
As less aggressive towards you, therefore, killing and offensive creatures and plants

795
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,720
will not yield experience points.

796
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,720
All the reeflings siding with humans want to be the guy from strongy's lore video.

797
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Oh, I'm so bad.

798
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
Hope a siren doesn't drown me in the ocean.

799
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Thank you.

800
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Thank you, Anonymous, for the tip.

801
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Oh, you guys don't want me to, you know, take you down in the waters with me, that's not.

802
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Honestly, my lore is so evil.

803
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,720
I promise, I don't want to, I don't want to hurt.

804
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
What?

805
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Why do I suck so bad at this?

806
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Wait, what was that?

807
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,720
No way, they have a slow motion kill cam.

808
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,720
I did not recall that whatsoever.

809
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
That's amazing.

810
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Don't threaten us with a good time.

811
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
That sounds very yandere-esque.

812
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,720
But yeah, in terms of evilness in lore, why?

813
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
What was that?

814
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
I heard that.

815
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
I can hear it.

816
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,720
I actually got scared there.

817
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I heard it, but I couldn't turn the analog stick in time.

818
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
So if I am human-

819
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Why are there so many?

820
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Oh no, I heard the plant.

821
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mr. Plant.

822
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
I'm actually getting a bit scared.

823
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Why is there so many?

824
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

825
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
Pause.

826
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
Pause, I hear more.

827
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Oh my god, they're literally biting my ankles.

828
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
They're biting my ankles.

829
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

830
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Stop.

831
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Okay, relax.

832
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Relax or just collect and sell samples in this area.

833
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
I think I've hurt every...

834
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
All the enemies are gone.

835
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Yeah, so these type animals don't attack.

836
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,720
They can't bite my ankles, man.

837
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
If you are human and come across this plant,

838
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
it is very poisonous.

839
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,720
It spits a bale at you, which is actually really cool.

840
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,720
But the design elements that went into this game

841
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
is just beautiful.

842
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,720
But yeah, the development, you can actually...

843
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
Yeah, you can scan...

844
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Who goes there?

845
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,720
You can scan stuff and add it to a database and that.

846
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
I've never 100% of that.

847
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,720
Oh no, we can't because I would have to play the RDA side.

848
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
But I'm not playing the bad boy side.

849
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,720
But yeah, if you're into 100% completion,

850
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
absolutely you can do that kind of thing.

851
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,720
But it is a very beautiful game.

852
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,720
I am very much into alternative...

853
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,720
I saw that, it popped up my little thingies.

854
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
I knew it.

855
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,720
We can do this and just kind of try and bypass

856
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
all the enemies on the way.

857
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Enemies.

858
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Did you watch the second movie?

859
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
I absolutely did.

860
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,720
I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie with Jake Sully.

861
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Absolutely.

862
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
I love your names, Jake, by the way.

863
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Absolutely fantastic movies.

864
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Completely captured me in that kind of fantasy,

865
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,720
different world, especially the night time scenes

866
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
when everything is lighting up.

867
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Speaking of lighting up, hold on.

868
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Reactive model, you ready?

869
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Reactive model, do you want this?

870
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Or do you want my normal model?

871
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
I can turn over in it.

872
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
The bioluminescence scenes.

873
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
Yes, bioluminescence scenes.

874
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Pushing boots to destroyed Avatar 2 in the box office.

875
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Nah.

876
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Woo, our first meet with a navi.

877
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Like an actual navi, not an RDA navi.

878
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Are you ready?

879
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Hello, Tanjala.

880
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Oh, I'm stuck on this corpse of a theme of Ober.

881
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Hello.

882
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Hello, I'm on a kayak.

883
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
This is good.

884
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Oh, Renee Harper is a corny weaver.

885
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
She's been poused with a navi.

886
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
She overslept them.

887
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,720
Tanjala wants you to kill the sick, strong beasts.

888
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Anyone else identify themselves as a strong beast?

889
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
That's ridiculous.

890
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,720
We're really starting to dig hard for these words.

891
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Avatar 2 had no story at all.

892
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
A perfect how not to make a sequel.

893
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
I disagree.

894
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Brian!

895
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Exactly!

896
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Exactly, Grimble.

897
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Thank you for the tip.

898
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
We do, Brian.

899
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
I have not seen fair and golly.

900
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Bajinga!

901
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Thank you for the tip.

902
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
What's fair and golly?

903
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Have you guys seen fair and golly?

904
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Are you doing what you eat?

905
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,720
You like Sigourney Weaver a lot.

906
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,720
So, Sigourney Weaver, the first thing I've seen her in.

907
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Oh, we're just to destroy these, by the way.

908
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Sigourney Weaver Avatar was the first thing I ever saw her in.

909
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
And I just adored her.

910
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
I adored her character.

911
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Her voice is so lovely as well.

912
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
It's such a...

913
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
If you ever struggle at this point,

914
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
just jump up on this rock right here.

915
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
They can't...

916
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
Oh!

917
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
They can't hurt you if you go on the rock.

918
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
They can't do a thing.

919
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
If you're on the floor, these guys will knock you over

920
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,720
and take a big chunk of your health.

921
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Is something else attacking me?

922
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
No.

923
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
But we're good to go.

924
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Robin Williams plays a bat in this.

925
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Fair and golly is basically the Barbie Pixie...

926
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,720
The Barbie Pixie movie in 2D, but human...

927
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
What?

928
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
And humans are bad guys.

929
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
It was a good movie.

930
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,720
The direct to VHS sequel was...

931
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Okay.

932
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
Tim Curry sings.

933
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
Oh my god, Rocky Horror Picture Show.

934
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
You put your hands on your leg.

935
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
No, that's not right.

936
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
You put your hands on your hips.

937
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,720
That's it.

938
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
I find a dance inside.

939
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
We should watch that.

940
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,720
My mum really likes that movie.

941
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
So I've watched it from a young age.

942
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Yeah, it's absolutely bizarre to conceptualise

943
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,720
what on earth happens in that movie at a young age.

944
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
But hey ho!

945
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
That's just life.

946
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
That's just how it is.

947
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,720
We're going to...

948
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Oh!

949
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
I heard.

950
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Butta dog.

951
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Dog with a butta.

952
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
I heard that.

953
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
And mama.

954
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Get your butt to the top of that.

955
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
I want that.

956
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,720
What are you doing here?

957
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
I'm so tainy.

958
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Oh no, I'm so big.

959
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
POV, you're Azura?

960
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
You're talking to Azura right now.

961
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
This is the hate difference between you and Azura.

962
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
What's going on?

963
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
I'm shutting down the knob.

964
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,720
It's Emmy and Azura.

965
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Oh, we Emmy.

966
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
A giant woman.

967
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
No, don't lie.

968
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Don't lie right now.

969
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,720
And say to me, I didn't cook with making Azura a giantess.

970
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
I will not take...

971
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
Right, if that's not going to hurt me,

972
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I'm actually just going to leg it.

973
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,720
I'm legging it, boys.

974
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
We're doing it.

975
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
We're doing it.

976
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
We're doing it.

977
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
Oh!

978
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Wah!

979
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,720
Wah!

980
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Right, we're just going to stealth through this section.

981
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,720
There's a lot of dire wolves.

982
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
Eh, viper wolves.

983
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,720
However, we're no interested in fighting.

984
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
So, we're just going to zoom past

985
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,720
because this entire section is optional, honestly.

986
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
We're just going to zoom ahead again.

987
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,720
Cooked.

988
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,720
You did indeed cook.

989
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,720
No, I knew I wanted some sort of thick Vtuber model.

990
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.

991
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,720
There's really not that much variety for the thick

992
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,720
and for the chocolate.

993
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,720
So, it was just absolutely no questions asked.

994
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Probably going to do the same in Gen 2

995
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,720
where, you know, something's going to be lovely in Gen 2.

996
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Brian!

997
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Didn't expect Sigourney Weaver to side

998
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,720
with the Navi considering her history with aliens.

999
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
Is she the main...

1000
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,720
Is she the main alien?

1001
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Because I remember reading a really...

1002
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Oh, we're on a horse, by the way.

1003
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
Check it out.

1004
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Look at my horse.

1005
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
My horse is amazing.

1006
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Oh my God, its face is all...

1007
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,720
That's a really unfortunate face.

1008
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Everything else, yeah, that's all right.

1009
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
Look, I'm riding a pony.

1010
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
I'm such a girl.

1011
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Oh my God, this is the girls game as well.

1012
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Oh, no.

1013
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
Oh, there's actually really...

1014
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,720
This is really boring,

1015
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
but when we come back to this section later,

1016
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,720
an enemy always spawns on this rock

1017
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,720
and he's infinite stuck and you can never, like, hurt him.

1018
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Okay.

1019
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
It's time.

1020
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,720
We need to make a decision.

1021
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
Are we Navi?

1022
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,720
Thank you very much, Iron Reaper, for the tip.

1023
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,720
I think I actually forgot to say that, but thank you for the tip.

1024
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1025
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Nero!

1026
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,720
Speaking of, how tall is Stacy Milketon?

1027
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,720
Thank you, Nero, for the tip.

1028
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,720
So we are a signal specialist

1029
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
and we've set those signals up,

1030
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
but we were told that they weren't gonna...

1031
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,720
It wasn't gonna be used for destroying Navi.

1032
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
Nori, nori.

1033
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,720
Ah!

1034
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,720
So we're learning we just destroyed all the Navi's home.

1035
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,720
It's work.

1036
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
Are we the baddies?

1037
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Raider?

1038
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Hardly even nor.

1039
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
Oh wait, sorry, sorry, hold on, do that again.

1040
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
Raider?

1041
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
Hardly even nor.

1042
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,720
Come on, how goofy is that?

1043
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,720
I wanted to see...

1044
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
Raider, are you ready?

1045
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
Are you ready?

1046
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,720
We're gonna do it again.

1047
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
Okay, hold on, let's do this bit

1048
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
and then when we're mucking about I'll do it again, okay?

1049
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
That was amazing.

1050
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,720
Right, so this is where you decide.

1051
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
Do you want to be Navi or do you want to be RDA?

1052
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
If I shoot him, we become RDA.

1053
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,720
If I shoot him, we become Navi

1054
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
and defend this Pandora

1055
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
in the name of being a foreigner.

1056
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,720
We need to kill it.

1057
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,720
We guys first go.

1058
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
Destroy him.

1059
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
Just...

1060
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Oh, I'm low health.

1061
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Oh my God, I'm farting about too much.

1062
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,720
Oh, why is he so strong?

1063
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,720
Right, go.

1064
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,720
Wait, I'm actually gonna get...

1065
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,720
I think I'm actually gonna perish.

1066
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,720
He's like actually wrecking and decking me.

1067
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,720
What's going on?

1068
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,720
Why is his health not going down?

1069
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,720
Why is my aim bought so bad?

1070
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,720
Right, hold on, hold on.

1071
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,720
Hold on, let me aim bought.

1072
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,720
He healed up!

1073
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,720
No, no!

1074
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
Only I'm allowed to heal up.

1075
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,720
The enemies shouldn't be allowed to heal up.

1076
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,720
It should be illegal in video games.

1077
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,720
Development team, you have failed.

1078
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,720
It should be...

1079
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,720
Why is he only shooting me as well?

1080
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,720
Can you like shoot that other guy?

1081
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,720
Right, hold on.

1082
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,720
Let me readjust this aim bought.

1083
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,720
No, he healed up!

1084
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,720
Only I'm supposed to be healed up!

1085
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
Right, that's it.

1086
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,720
Grim pound!

1087
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,720
It didn't even work.

1088
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,720
Did it work?

1089
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,720
I don't know.

1090
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
I'm gonna be honest.

1091
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,720
This is a few too many bullets are going through you.

1092
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,720
I spoke too many bullets.

1093
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,720
Sudden darts.

1094
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,720
He survived all those bullets.

1095
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,720
I gotta go now.

1096
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Grab your dire horse.

1097
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,720
Dire horse?

1098
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,720
Banshee!

1099
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,720
Ik-nee-ma-ya.

1100
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
Ik-nu-ee-ma-ya.

1101
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
No idea who I'm supposed to see.

1102
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Ik-nee-ma-ya.

1103
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,720
Ik-nee-ma-ya.

1104
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,720
Sounds like I'm trying to say something in the dark.

1105
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,720
The RDA doesn't do anything piecemeal.

1106
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,720
Ik-kawanyo?

1107
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,720
It's not Ik-kawanyu.

1108
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
Got anything better than bows and arrows?

1109
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,720
They defend their homeland.

1110
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Those are the only weapons they need.

1111
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,720
Great.

1112
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,720
Good choice, Ryder.

1113
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,720
Ik-nee-ma-ya.

1114
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,720
That's what I'm saying now.

1115
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,720
Couldn't humans kill the main guys?

1116
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,720
Human body in the machines?

1117
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,720
Yes.

1118
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,720
That's very true.

1119
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,720
But it was arranged that the...

1120
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,720
Look out!

1121
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,720
Oh, look out!

1122
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,720
We stunning on them.

1123
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,720
Look at this.

1124
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Got a little outfit of the day moment check.

1125
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
Come on.

1126
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
Look at my jewel-wield blades.

1127
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,720
Come on.

1128
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,720
That's so cool.

1129
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,720
Oh, how did I hit?

1130
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,720
That's so cool.

1131
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,720
Come on.

1132
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,720
That's so cool.

1133
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,720
I'm sorry, but look how cool that...

1134
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,720
Oh, my God!

1135
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,720
That's terrifying.

1136
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,720
Imagine that running at you.

1137
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,720
Oh, I just cracked myself right there.

1138
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,720
Your avatar isn't blonde because blonde doesn't exist in Navi.

1139
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,720
I don't think...

1140
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,720
Maybe it does.

1141
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
I don't know.

1142
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,720
I don't think I've recall seen a blonde Navi.

1143
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
Oh, no.

1144
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,720
I do in the different regions of...

1145
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,720
But we are jungle Navi.

1146
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,720
This is jungle Navi.

1147
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,720
There's different types of Navi.

1148
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
Or jungle Navi.

1149
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,720
Sadly, not closer to your level plus.

1150
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,720
We need to win his approval.

1151
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
Oh, my God.

1152
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
She's so real for that.

1153
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
That's...

1154
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,720
Okay, we need to try and get the approval of this guy.

1155
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
Why?

1156
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,720
I've already forgotten the plot, but we're going to do it anyway.

1157
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,720
But basically, we are full Navi right now,

1158
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
and I'm going to tell you something.

1159
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
Okay, this really is a girls game,

1160
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
because every time we go to the next location,

1161
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,720
we unlock new outfits as we level up,

1162
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
and I get to like play a little wardrobe simulator.

1163
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,720
Such a girls game.

1164
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,720
That's such a girls game.

1165
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,720
Yeah, he ain't happy at all to see me in.

1166
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,720
Oh, I need to be able to raid a Banshee or an Ikran.

1167
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,720
That's what they're called.

1168
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,720
Oh, my God.

1169
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,720
Blanky.

1170
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
Hold on.

1171
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,720
I need to get what's the link,

1172
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,720
because I'm hurting my legs against the table.

1173
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,720
Ooh.

1174
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,720
Did I just skip dialogue down that?

1175
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,720
Oopsie daisy.

1176
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,720
New outfits.

1177
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,720
Let's go to the next area.

1178
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,720
Oh, my God.

1179
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,720
Fashion Simulator.

1180
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,720
We played Landlord Simulator on Brotherhood.

1181
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,720
Now we're playing Fashion Simulator on Avatar.

1182
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,720
Right.

1183
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,720
We are about to learn a motherfucking bow and arrow.

1184
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,720
Oh, did not mean to do that one.

1185
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,720
Let's try that again.

1186
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,720
Pardon me.

1187
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,720
Excuse me.

1188
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,720
That was very daft.

1189
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,720
I just absolutely threw myself off the mat there.

1190
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,720
How does zooming on the bow and arrow again?

1191
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,720
Not that one.

1192
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,720
Oh, wow.

1193
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,720
It's just hold and release.

1194
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,720
Okay.

1195
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,720
Who would have thought?

1196
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,720
Who would have thought?

1197
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,720
It's just holding release.

1198
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,720
The Navi's drip is indeed real true.

1199
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,720
This game seems surprisingly competent, actually.

1200
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,720
I was doubting.

1201
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,720
I get game.

1202
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,720
It is.

1203
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,720
Honestly, I get game.

1204
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,720
Wait.

1205
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,720
What am I doing?

1206
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,720
Oh, we're doing our first human kill.

1207
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,720
Oh.

1208
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,720
Yeah.

1209
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
The aim is very forgiving.

1210
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
If you want an easy game.

1211
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,720
Definitely recommend this game.

1212
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,720
The bow and arrow is very satisfactory.

1213
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,720
But I'll tell you one thing though.

1214
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
Oh, look at this camera.

1215
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,720
Look how terrible this camera like pings off of different.

1216
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,720
Like you can see the markers of where they put the tracking to do that.

1217
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,720
Like it's not smooth.

1218
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,720
Like.

1219
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,720
Oh my God.

1220
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Who goes there?

1221
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,720
Identify yourself.

1222
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,720
I need to jump.

1223
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,720
First human after killing two low level.

1224
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
So actually true.

1225
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,720
I just recalled that.

1226
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,720
Really, really willy nilly killing over here.

1227
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
Any willy killers?

1228
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,720
No, don't.

1229
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,720
This is another armor we kind of get to unlock about later on.

1230
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
It's not quite the same.

1231
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,720
But here we speak to bar a word for it.

1232
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,720
I hear you betrayed your own kind to be here.

1233
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,720
Yeah.

1234
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,720
How soon will you betray us?

1235
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,720
It will take more than this offering.

1236
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,720
The scale of the arrows are massive they are.

1237
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,720
Like Navi are so big.

1238
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,720
So there wasn't a big tree in the game?

1239
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,720
Oh, we aren't at the end of the game yet.

1240
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,720
You just hold on to that thought.

1241
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,720
You're a couple of missions ahead.

1242
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,720
But I like doing this.

1243
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,720
They don't disconnect us for treason, honestly.

1244
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,720
She wants the braid tails?

1245
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,720
What happens if we braid tails with each other?

1246
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
Is that like a marriage proposal?

1247
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,720
Is that Navi?

1248
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,720
We braid each other's?

1249
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
He will not show it.

1250
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,720
Oh, that's his wife?

1251
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,720
Come, we must destroy Sky Tower.

1252
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
We find these.

1253
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,720
How will you say?

1254
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,720
Take care.

1255
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,720
Will you help us?

1256
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,720
These boxes are explosives.

1257
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,720
TNT?

1258
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,720
Yes.

1259
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,720
We have word for this.

1260
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,720
Kangangang.

1261
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,720
Kangangang.

1262
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,720
Oh, that's so satisfying to say.

1263
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,720
Kangangang.

1264
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,720
Is that a TNT?

1265
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,720
Kangangang.

1266
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,720
I messed with that.

1267
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,720
You can flip into the waterfall to get down here a bit faster

1268
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,720
than going all the way around the map.

1269
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,720
I will heal.

1270
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,720
I shouldn't have done that.

1271
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,720
I thought you could slip down without too much.

1272
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,720
Oh, you have 50 bow.

1273
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,720
And every time you get a sample,

1274
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,720
you replenish your bow and arrow ammunition.

1275
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,720
So all those green is more bows.

1276
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
Genghis Khan?

1277
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,720
Okay.

1278
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,720
You're done.

1279
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,720
Excuse me.

1280
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,720
Pardon me.

1281
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,720
Coming through.

1282
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,720
You guys can't aim.

1283
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,720
Oh, I can't aim either.

1284
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,720
It's fine.

1285
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,720
Okay.

1286
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,720
I think because my keyboard is registering.

1287
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,720
Hello?

1288
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,720
Hello?

1289
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,720
Okay.

1290
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
I think because my keyboard is registering,

1291
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,720
the aim assist isn't being as active as it is normally

1292
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,720
on Xbox.

1293
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,720
Because I could have sworn I didn't even have to aim.

1294
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,720
Conta.

1295
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,720
Jeez.

1296
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,720
They just disappear.

1297
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,720
Okay.

1298
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,720
We seem to get either 5 or 10 arrows from samples,

1299
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,720
which is pretty good.

1300
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,720
I would say that's pretty good.

1301
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,720
Kangangang.

1302
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,720
Hans was simulator, actually.

1303
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,720
I prefer the born hours myself,

1304
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,720
but I'll tell you something that's really sad about this game.

1305
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,720
As we level up,

1306
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,720
our equipment also becomes stronger in nature.

1307
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,720
Okay.

1308
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,720
However,

1309
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,720
if you did not purchase the special edition,

1310
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,720
which they made about 1000 copies of for some unknown reason,

1311
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,720
if they didn't do the special,

1312
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,720
if you didn't buy it,

1313
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,720
your bow does not one-shot the enemies as you level up.

1314
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,720
It is complete nonsense.

1315
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,720
They made only so few copies.

1316
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,720
I was like,

1317
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,720
oh, do you see how that flower attack is attacking them

1318
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,720
and they're taking poison damage?

1319
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
So unfortunately,

1320
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,720
our bow and arrow,

1321
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
I can't even see them through the...

1322
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Bra, why are you missing?

1323
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,720
Bra.

1324
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,720
You do heal over time naturally when there's no fight,

1325
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,720
so you don't always have to spam heals.

1326
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,720
What's this?

1327
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,720
What's that?

1328
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,720
Ammo.

1329
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,720
I thought my ammo...

1330
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,720
Whoa!

1331
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,720
Wait, what do I have access to?

1332
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,720
So dual wields,

1333
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,720
one big ass swing,

1334
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,720
a gun and a bow, right?

1335
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,720
I normally just stick the bow.

1336
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,720
Very good.

1337
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,720
Very good, very nice.

1338
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,720
But overall,

1339
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,720
game is very forgiving.

1340
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,720
If you're ever interested,

1341
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,720
we should do that,

1342
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,720
but that comes later.

1343
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,720
We'll always come...

1344
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,720
Oh!

1345
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,720
The acran just said bye to that.

1346
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
I'm pretty sure they would have got mowed over,

1347
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,720
but like,

1348
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,720
as long as they're happy,

1349
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,720
I'm happy.

1350
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,720
So right now,

1351
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,720
we're picking up our boom boom Genghis Khan.

1352
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,720
Do you mind?

1353
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,720
Where did you come from?

1354
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,720
You weren't even there.

1355
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,720
You're such a liar.

1356
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,720
You're lying.

1357
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,720
Where are they?

1358
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,720
I hear them.

1359
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,720
Snipe,

1360
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,720
and not snipe.

1361
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,720
I am low health.

1362
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
That's okay.

1363
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,720
We're gonna heal up like that.

1364
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,720
She can heal up.

1365
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,720
And then we're just gonna move.

1366
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,720
Oh, we're not gonna move on to the next section.

1367
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,720
We're gonna go invisible.

1368
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,720
Oh, no, we're not.

1369
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,720
Can you still...

1370
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,720
I don't know if you saw that.

1371
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,720
Those flies were attacking him.

1372
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,720
Like literally,

1373
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
Pandora is so nice to you when you're napping.

1374
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,720
I love it.

1375
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,720
Oh, I hear them.

1376
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,720
Oh, so these are bombs

1377
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,720
that fly into you.

1378
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,720
I'm pretty sure I heard a guy's voice though.

1379
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
I'm like 99% sure.

1380
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,720
I heard a guy saying they're out there,

1381
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,720
but I didn't see it.

1382
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,720
I love the way you say jaw wield.

1383
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,720
Oh, no.

1384
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,720
Wait, does it say differently?

1385
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,720
Jew...

1386
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,720
Jewel wield?

1387
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,720
Jewel weel.

1388
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,720
Jewel.

1389
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,720
Pandora thinks humans are an infection.

1390
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,720
They are.

1391
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,720
They're terrible.

1392
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,720
When you play RDF,

1393
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,720
it's just as truly similar.

1394
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,720
Oh, that's hilarious, honestly.

1395
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
It's such a good game.

1396
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,720
Such a good game.

1397
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,720
I love this game so much.

1398
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,720
The only complaint I have about this game,

1399
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,720
it was made when games like to do...

1400
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,720
Why?

1401
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,720
It's like I have to aim a little to the right.

1402
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,720
I do.

1403
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,720
I've aimed a little to the right.

1404
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,720
We can go down or up.

1405
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,720
My memory says up, question mark.

1406
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,720
Jewel wield.

1407
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,720
Well, my memory was correct.

1408
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,720
Oh!

1409
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,720
He got a little ambitious

1410
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,720
for trying to hurt me there.

1411
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,720
Where is this?

1412
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,720
It's up there?

1413
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,720
Oh, it might be up there.

1414
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,720
Whoa, I just spotted you in the corner of my eye.

1415
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,720
Yeah, these are literally...

1416
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,720
You know, I don't know what they're called.

1417
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,720
Those bombs that are for submarines under the water.

1418
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,720
I don't know what their name is,

1419
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,720
but that's what those are, but in the air.

1420
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,720
Oh, I missed.

1421
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,720
Yeah, the aimball in this game,

1422
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,720
working!

1423
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,720
Aimball, please!

1424
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,720
Wait, he didn't perish?

1425
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,720
Jeez.

1426
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,720
It looks like they're...

1427
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,720
Oh, we need to shoot that.

1428
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,720
Hold on.

1429
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,720
Wait, do we actually?

1430
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1431
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,720
Don't remember this part of the game, geez.

1432
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,720
What's the rocks for?

1433
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,720
Am I to destroy these?

1434
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,720
No way.

1435
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,720
Yeah, so I'm using bullets too.

1436
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,720
Un-ball, un-mort.

1437
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,720
More like, sent-ball, un-mort.

1438
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,720
Why? The aim assist is not like me.

1439
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,720
I'm not actually going to claim that tree of nature.

1440
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,720
That's what...

1441
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,720
The travel point, because...

1442
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,720
Holy crap.

1443
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,720
Oh, no, I don't have unlimited ammo!

1444
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,720
Bruh! I thought I had unlimited ammo!

1445
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,720
Jeez.

1446
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,720
What did that do as a child that made...

1447
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,720
It really must just be the aim assist.

1448
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,720
Because I think if you all one-shot everything,

1449
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,720
there's like no way this stuff is even hurting me half as much.

1450
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,720
Oh, I missed.

1451
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,720
I shot, and I missed again.

1452
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,720
And then I shot, and then I missed again.

1453
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,720
And again.

1454
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,720
I don't know how to unshoot.

1455
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,720
I can't pick up ammo from that.

1456
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,720
I can only pick up ammo shells.

1457
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,720
Honestly!

1458
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,720
Let's see if we can get away with this.

1459
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,720
Because we just need to pick up the package and then go.

1460
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,720
Oh, wow.

1461
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,720
Okay, cutscene time.

1462
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,720
Cutscene time!

1463
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,720
Whoa!

1464
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,720
Gang, gang, gang!

1465
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,720
Gang is gone!

1466
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,720
Okay, let's get the heck out of here,

1467
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,720
I don't want to get hurt anymore than we need to.

1468
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,720
I heard that belief and I was going to go for it.

1469
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,720
I think we're about to get on her screen.

1470
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,720
Long story short, I missed.

1471
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,720
Yeah, I missed again.

1472
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
And then I shot.

1473
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,720
And then I shot.

1474
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,720
And then I missed again.

1475
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,720
Thumb arrived.

1476
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,720
Alright.

1477
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,720
Okay, we're about to climb.

1478
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,720
Climb, climb, climb, climb!

1479
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,720
Yeah, I think the campaign mode is roughly 7 hours.

1480
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,720
We could probably come back in 100% the sectors.

1481
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,720
And we can also play this mini-conquest game,

1482
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
which actually I really enjoyed as a kid.

1483
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,720
But you have to do it at the end of the game

1484
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,720
for like 100% success rate.

1485
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,720
There are Viper Wolves ahead,

1486
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,720
but we're just going to be cheeky and do this.

1487
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,720
And then we completely negate

1488
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,720
even having to fight a lot of them.

1489
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,720
Unfortunately, invisibility...

1490
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:25,720
No, invincibility is when they can't hurt you.

1491
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,720
Invisibility is when they can't sneeze.

1492
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,720
It doesn't last forever,

1493
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,720
but as we level up...

1494
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,720
Like...

1495
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,720
Oh, actually we're really close to leveling up.

1496
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,720
I don't know if I should...

1497
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,720
I don't want to hurt the wolves.

1498
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,720
I don't want to hurt the wolves,

1499
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
but I'll kill the humans, no problem.

1500
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,720
Yeah, no, that's fine.

1501
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,720
That's fine.

1502
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,720
Yeah, that thing, that thing.

1503
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
It's friendly fire on.

1504
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,720
No, you cannot hurt other navi

1505
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,720
now that you're a navi side.

1506
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,720
I assume it's the same if you pick RDA.

1507
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,720
Oh, good snipe.

1508
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,720
Oh, good snipe.

1509
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,720
Okay, if I can take my time to properly aim.

1510
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,720
No, I think I was out of range.

1511
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,720
There is a range to your attacks.

1512
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,720
Like, you can't...

1513
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,720
Oh, well, I just suck.

1514
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,720
There we go.

1515
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,720
There is a range distance to your attacks.

1516
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,720
I cannot for the life of the human.

1517
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,720
Am I to go this way?

1518
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,720
Am I to go this way?

1519
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,720
No, classic dead end.

1520
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,720
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1521
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,720
Mom, get the camera.

1522
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,720
Play of the game, honestly.

1523
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,720
Did you guys see that Marvel Superhero,

1524
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,720
like 5v5?

1525
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,720
I hear a bomb.

1526
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,720
I see a bomb.

1527
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
Um, um, um, um, um, um,

1528
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,720
I really don't want the bomb to get me.

1529
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,720
Oh, I'm already out of in this.

1530
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,720
And the bomb is chasing me.

1531
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,720
Okay, we're doing it.

1532
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,720
We're just going for it.

1533
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,720
We're committing.

1534
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,720
Did anyone play it?

1535
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,720
Marvel rivals.

1536
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,720
Yeah.

1537
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,720
It looks so good.

1538
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,720
Everyone was, like, dogging on it,

1539
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,720
but I'm like,

1540
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,720
oh, I actually really enjoyed the look of it.

1541
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,720
Uh,

1542
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,720
I'm installing the game now

1543
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,720
just to kill the Navi.

1544
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,720
You know what?

1545
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,720
You're done.

1546
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,720
You're done.

1547
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,720
I'm definitely going to play

1548
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,720
Marvel Overwatch when it comes out.

1549
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,720
Yeah, and then wasn't there

1550
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,720
not another company

1551
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,720
that came out with another

1552
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,720
Overwatch-style game?

1553
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,720
I think it was Marvel.

1554
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,720
It was a company that came out

1555
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,720
with another Overwatch-style game.

1556
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,720
I think development teams

1557
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,720
literally watched, like,

1558
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,720
the mess up in real time.

1559
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,720
I don't know if that thing's still chasing me, but,

1560
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,720
um,

1561
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,720
there is another one.

1562
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,720
Yeah, like Scarlet Witch

1563
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,720
with Moira and all that.

1564
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,720
Yeah.

1565
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,720
I used to play a lot of Overwatch.

1566
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,720
I actually really enjoyed the game,

1567
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,720
but I just don't play it anymore.

1568
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,720
Like, I don't find it rewarding,

1569
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,720
or,

1570
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,720
which is such a shame,

1571
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,720
because I've poured

1572
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,720
a lot of hours into that game.

1573
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,720
Um,

1574
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,720
but I would absolutely love

1575
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,720
if we could do Marvel rivals together

1576
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,720
as, like, a stream snag game.

1577
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,720
Like, um,

1578
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,720
I don't know how the accounts work,

1579
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,720
but I'm, like, 99% sure

1580
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,720
I can make a dummy account,

1581
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,720
and then, like,

1582
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,720
add users' friends,

1583
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,720
and then make note of who's, like, played,

1584
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,720
and then just rotate between,

1585
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,720
like, kind of what we...

1586
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,720
Oh, here we go.

1587
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,720
Level up.

1588
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,720
What did I unlock?

1589
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,720
Let's see.

1590
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,720
Uh, Bam Knee Pack.

1591
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,720
We have a club weapon with frickin' spears on it,

1592
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,720
or another type of RDA gun.

1593
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,720
Oh.

1594
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,720
And a shot.

1595
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,720
And a missed.

1596
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,720
Oh, and a missed again.

1597
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,720
I can hear an enemy.

1598
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,720
I don't see him.

1599
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,720
Oh, there he is.

1600
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,720
That wasn't him that said that.

1601
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,720
Oh well.

1602
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,720
Whatever.

1603
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,720
Whatever.

1604
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,720
Um...

1605
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,720
Blizzard is horrible with their IPs yet.

1606
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,720
Time to go back to Team Fortress 2.

1607
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,720
Honestly?

1608
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,720
But I'm sh...

1609
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,720
I could have sworn I saw another development team

1610
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,720
come out with something that was similar

1611
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,720
out to the format as well.

1612
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,720
So I think, literally, everyone watched,

1613
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,720
uh, Overwatch 2 come out,

1614
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,720
and as soon as Jeff Kaplan left the development team,

1615
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,720
I think everyone behind the scenes

1616
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,720
knew what on Earth was up

1617
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,720
and knew it was, like,

1618
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,720
essentially gonna flop

1619
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,720
due to the, uh,

1620
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,720
change in...

1621
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,720
gameplay.

1622
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,720
But when Marvel Rivals does come out,

1623
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,720
uh,

1624
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,720
because I think it's in beta right now,

1625
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,720
or...

1626
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,720
I may be wrong,

1627
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
um,

1628
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,720
I'm happy to make a dummy account.

1629
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,720
We'll make it a multiplayer game,

1630
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,720
and, uh,

1631
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,720
we'll just kinda...

1632
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,720
uh,

1633
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,720
add in,

1634
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,720
uh,

1635
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,720
I think it's 5v5,

1636
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,720
so it means four reeflings of myself

1637
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,720
can play at the same time

1638
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,720
against, uh,

1639
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,720
just randomers.

1640
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,720
Um,

1641
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,720
we'll, like,

1642
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,720
play actual public match games,

1643
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,720
uh,

1644
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,720
unless you guys

1645
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,720
really wanted to go against each other.

1646
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,720
I'm not sure having me and your team

1647
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,720
will be a good idea though,

1648
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,720
cause I'm not very strong at the game

1649
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,720
cause I've yet to even play it.

1650
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,720
Um...

1651
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,720
But if that's something you guys

1652
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,720
are down for,

1653
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,720
I'm heking down for it as well,

1654
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,720
uh,

1655
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,720
obviously,

1656
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,720
uh,

1657
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,720
we'll

1658
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,720
remove everyone

1659
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,720
at the end of the gaming session

1660
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,720
and restart fresh.

1661
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,720
As I said,

1662
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,720
it'll be

1663
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,720
pow!

1664
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,720
I saw that,

1665
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
I don't know if I'm

1666
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
gonna get ahaaa!

1667
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
Right,

1668
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,720
I'm backing off,

1669
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,720
I'm backing off.

1670
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,720
I don't think

1671
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:24,960
down yet. No. That part comes later on. I didn't know. I'm gonna pick this up. Team

1672
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:31,240
Landers, Johnny. Oh, should I tell everyone what to do? Protect me, heal me, heal me.

1673
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:42,480
I used to play Zarya, which is an offensive tank. Over what? Oh my god, they're so beautiful.

1674
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:53,400
The music's changed. Oh, they're so beautiful. The ikran. Look at them all judging me. Oh,

1675
01:07:53,400 --> 01:08:01,360
that's okay. You can judge me. Look at them. They're so pretty. Hello. Please don't attack

1676
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:11,080
me. They're so beautiful. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Please understand. This game's a little old, which

1677
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:16,240
is why they're all the same color. Please forgive. Please forgive. But I assume the new avatar is

1678
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:22,960
like really beautiful. And my ikran literally almost made me perish and then said, yeah,

1679
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,880
all right, I'll pick you up. I got pranked by it. I literally done a little pranky on me.

1680
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:38,920
A little pranky-wanky. Oh. No. No. It's not a good look, honestly. I mean, you would really choose

1681
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:48,680
match over Mecha over the big birdie. Exactly. Why would you pick? Oh, look at us. We're so

1682
01:08:48,680 --> 01:09:04,040
lying. There's no an RDA that will leave alive because the resource destroying the Pandora.

1683
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:13,480
Oh, I love fly. Oh, ow, ow. Sorry, your wing, your wing. My apologies. Sorry.

1684
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:21,400
I didn't mean to hurt your wing, little Banshee, but thank you for being so forgiving.

1685
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:28,600
But we're just flying through the map now. Banshees have an insane HP. We will be shot at as we go

1686
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:37,000
around. I don't know if you read that really quickly. It said lifting the fog 50%. Don't worry.

1687
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,800
Oh, we really need to get some height. Oh, I'm going to do a little cheeky 360 to get that

1688
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:49,320
height there. We are about to reach the ceiling in this game. Oh, all right. Climb. Climb. Jeez,

1689
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:54,680
this map has a lot of verticality. Definitely did not remember that. But yes, there was a

1690
01:09:54,680 --> 01:10:00,120
sector challenge that says lifting the fog. There's a few sector challenges. Depending on how long

1691
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:08,840
the campaign takes, we might actually just 100% all the sections. Oh, excuse me, game.

1692
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:19,160
I know for a fact I flew over that. Would you like to register me flying through this?

1693
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:25,960
No. Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Women moment. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Lady drive.

1694
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,320
Okay, there we go. There we go. You got it in the end. I'm sure this is like really beautiful

1695
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:36,440
cinematic if you do. Oh, we got it. Okay, but we're hitting that rock. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Look,

1696
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,560
the camera angle isn't, it's not that easy to freaking dive, dive. All right, then go up,

1697
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:49,080
go up, go up. Hey, there we go. But yes, Banshee are a really good way to get around these maps.

1698
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:56,600
Whoa, easy, easy, easy. And we are back to the start where we started. Look at us going.

1699
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:02,680
Isn't that beautiful? Okay, I am going to say before we start this next quest,

1700
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:08,600
there is a voice line that repeats consistently through this mission. I will try to get through

1701
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:15,400
it as fast as possible. It is so annoying. It is so annoying. Genuinely so annoying,

1702
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,040
horrifically annoying. Unless this isn't the mission.

1703
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,600
Don't say that.

1704
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,360
Maybe this isn't the mission I thought it was.

1705
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:46,280
And where are the turkeys? Audio bugs are the worst. Is that Ubisoft game? It has to be.

1706
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:53,160
The, the animals slowly regretting letting you drive them, honestly. Okay, no, it's after this

1707
01:11:53,160 --> 01:12:00,120
mission. They're really annoying when pops up. What did we unlock? A crossbow and some sort of

1708
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:10,760
ability. Hold on. How do I open that? Skills? Kinetic dash, Ewa's breath, Titan bash I don't

1709
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:17,240
really use. We could maybe replace it with, Calls of Hyperwolf to your side. It'll fight for you

1710
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:23,800
for a short time. That's pretty cool. Honestly, bees, death by bees. Right, here we go. What the

1711
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,920
heck am I supposed to do? I completely forgot. Right, we're going to raid or a crane. Can I go on you?

1712
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,080
Okay, look. Oh, he's going forward. I never really,

1713
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:40,360
Hey, Ostrone, I'm off to work. But if the stream ends up being a bit longer,

1714
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,440
then I should be back in time. See you after work. Hope to catch you there.

1715
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:51,640
Thank you, tiny spiny. I appreciate the tip. And yes, um, I did look it up. I said the game

1716
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:56,120
takes around seven hours to complete. If we come back and do section stuff that wait,

1717
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:01,560
that where am I? That land? I think I'll land up here. Yeah. Okay. It looks like I'm definitely

1718
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:08,600
to land to keep that crane safe up here. You stay there, buddy. You be nice and safe. But

1719
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,960
yes, have a good day at work. Thanks for hanging. I appreciate it. And I appreciate the tip too.

1720
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,760
I'm not to say donations because it's not a donation. It's a tip.

1721
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,040
Actually, I don't know if I'm supposed to update the girls as things to be like,

1722
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,760
you know how you're supposed to put like a disclaimer on like the freaking thing in case

1723
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:36,680
someone does a charge back. Right. I'm 99% sure these guys just keep respawning. So I'm actually

1724
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:45,560
not to fuss. Do you mind? Thank you. I'm not to fuss for completely clearing up the section.

1725
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:57,560
Oh, it's a bomb. It's a bomb. Okay, there we go. Let's go up. Is that about to like blow up right

1726
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:03,800
next to me? Oh, I didn't. Oh, no, we didn't kill guys don't look at explosions. You know the drill.

1727
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,040
Okay. You know the drill. Kill guys don't look at explosion. Well, you mean stream,

1728
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:14,760
elements is intact. I like some if someone does like a thing, a disclaimer for charge right would

1729
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:20,520
be I'll probably edit the motor then or when I get off. I don't know. I get tired. I get tired

1730
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:29,000
after screaming. Okay. Oh, I have a fantastic update for scripts. Oh my goodness. So the script

1731
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:38,360
manager now has access and is taking over and look. So everyone has a four part series coming out

1732
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:46,200
like a story that kind of progresses. Sheeby's four part series is currently being written right

1733
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:52,760
now. I'm not trying to say anything, but good luck trying to hold it together when she performs that

1734
01:14:52,760 --> 01:15:00,840
script. Because wow, I was blown away. I'm like, there's definitely like something to be said about

1735
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:06,760
like a guy writing a script versus like what I could write because I just like I like challenging

1736
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:13,320
myself and in general like I know what overall you'd like us to say type thing. But I have to

1737
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:20,200
admit I was like, oh my god, there's not going to be any anything left in the sack after that one.

1738
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:26,680
And that was part one I read. I didn't even read the finalized series of it. And Azur's one is being

1739
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:35,560
worked on next. Oh my god. Sorry. I didn't I wasn't paying attention to like how many bad guys are

1740
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,280
there? Right, we're going to watch the explosion this time because we can. What's the explosion look like?

1741
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:45,080
Okay, it was just kind of out of control. Oh no, the tower does go down. Okay, I like it.

1742
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:51,880
I wonder if we can get some XP for destroying this. Ow. Okay, we can get XP for doing that.

1743
01:15:52,920 --> 01:16:01,560
I think, why didn't? Azur's story, I don't I don't know if I should ruin what the story is. Like,

1744
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,560
I don't want to like tell stuff that's kind of like exciting for the girls.

1745
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:14,440
But like, I like the four part series ideas, like Emmys one I really like. No, don't spoil it. Okay,

1746
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:19,160
I won't spoil it. Um, oh, there's a home tree right there. Actually, I don't know if I should grab it

1747
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:24,280
the now. Actually, no, I have access to the Ikaran to fly around the map. So it's not going to be that

1748
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:33,480
a deal of us coming back. Newbie would begin a work is a lot. Yes, I like so now that like the

1749
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:40,040
scripts are no longer my problem, I get to focus on making the girl short. So Mercy came out with

1750
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:44,600
a short and she was like, do you do you think I should have been blonde Senpai and showed like

1751
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,800
behind the scenes artwork? I'm going to get everyone to do that to show their concept art like me as

1752
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:54,840
well. Actually, I need to write the scripts. And like, I get to work on that kind of fun stuff

1753
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:03,400
instead of kind of like being stretched too far. Like, it's too easy. It's too easy. I'm not even

1754
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:10,120
going to say it's that easy. Um, you can go as well because you were shooting my crime. You're

1755
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:17,160
not supposed to shoot my crime. Um, literally, spoiler channel is always looking for literally,

1756
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:23,240
uh, just I get so excited about everything that's planned behind the scenes that I'm like, oh,

1757
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:28,040
I don't want to ruin it for the girls. Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,

1758
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:32,520
here, here, here, here, sorry, sorry. I'm too busy rambling. I'm not even actually focusing on the

1759
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:42,040
dang game play. Wait, oh no, we don't want shot them anymore. They've gotten too strong now. That's

1760
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:53,000
the problem. If you don't like, um, farm XP, you will fall behind. Concept art was great to

1761
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,160
see. Yeah, so I get to like kind of do that fun behind the scenes script stuff like the shorts

1762
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:09,240
for the girls. Um, um, also super gracious thank you to everyone who is using YouTube clip feature

1763
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:16,280
for the girls. Um, if you didn't know, if I go on their stream, I can see who and what has been

1764
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:22,200
clipped. I just want to say, uh, there's actually quite a few people who are clipping my burps at

1765
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:27,480
the moment. I might unironically make a 15 minute burp compilation just for the heck of it and call

1766
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:33,800
it like scrawny burps for 14 minutes and 53 seconds. Uh, and just for the heck of it because

1767
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:40,120
it seems to be something, uh, a few, uh, gentlemen seem to enjoy and you know, I'm not here to ruin

1768
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:46,360
anyone's day. Uh, but yes, please do consider clipping. We have a really funny, uh, short of

1769
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:53,720
icy coming soon. Um, our second clipper, we're kind of testing them out. I don't have a problem

1770
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,040
because I've already actually got extensive clip history, but they're busy at the moment. So the

1771
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:02,360
clips are a wee bit slow to be produced. We're getting there. We're getting there. So thank you

1772
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:07,800
to anyone who uses a YouTube clip feature. Does help out any highlight moments? A short of icy

1773
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:14,680
doing what? So it's already happened. So it's not a spoiler, but AC basically when,

1774
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:23,160
in her adorable voice, like, I'm not very smart. And then she went, thank you so much, Mike, honey,

1775
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:28,520
for donating to me and her adorable freaking accent. And I'm like, AC,

1776
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:34,920
ACICAL. Should I have taught you that? Should I have said to you what that means?

1777
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,920
So we're going to, we're going to get turned into a clip, not really sure on her thing.

1778
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:47,000
But her accent is so freaking adorable. Okay, I'm going to bed. Rest well. See you in the morning

1779
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,880
when you wake up, sweet dreams. I love seeing that. I love seeing that. Whenever you guys are like,

1780
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,000
okay, I need to go to work or I need to go to sleep. I'm like, yeah, see you in the morning. See you

1781
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,680
in the morning. Oh yeah, work or I'll see you after work. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you didn't go out

1782
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:04,840
do some errands. I'll see you after that. I'll still be on. Right. This is the scene. The quote is,

1783
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:11,320
Raider, you have got to get to higher ground. It will be repeated a ridiculous amount of times.

1784
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:17,320
Yep. I remember the quote. I've not even played this game in many a year. Raider, you've got to

1785
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:23,160
get to higher grounds. It will repeat. And I'm like, did no one play test this? Did no one see what

1786
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:29,800
an issue this is? Because I've gone the wrong way. I've gone the wrong way. Oh, and I've hurt

1787
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:38,120
myself. Let's hurry this up. Who's this section? Oh my God, imagine that coming at you. I would

1788
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:45,400
actually be so terrified. Shawnee, you've got to get to higher ground. Honestly. Get that done.

1789
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:51,240
Get that done. Right. We destroy one way.

1790
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:57,720
Oh, I love it. Love it. Special. What's right? Oh, no. What's my special?

1791
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:07,400
I don't know what button the special is, though. Yes, we spawn at checkpoint.

1792
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,000
It's putting, it's giving me keyboard input, but I'm playing mouse and controller. Like,

1793
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,600
I don't know if you can hear my analog stick. Right. Let's do that. Another try.

1794
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:21,160
That was a bit daft. I do apologize for that MLG game. I'm going the wrong way again.

1795
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:30,920
I can't all be good at video games. Literally, wherever nine year old me is inside my head right

1796
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:36,520
now, can you like come and like help us out here? Because this is getting very good. It's getting

1797
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:43,240
embarrassing. Right. I'm going to click the analog sticks this time to see if that's what the special

1798
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:50,280
is instead. Right. Special analog. Nope. That's, uh, nope. That's scan.

1799
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:56,600
What would R, what would R be? Am I literally, you know what? I'm just going to hit R and my

1800
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:03,000
keyboard. Are you squinting me right now? Oh, Stronny, you've got to get to higher ground.

1801
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,320
No, Anna, don't throw me. It's so, wait, why is this not breaking?

1802
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:15,560
Is there a health bar? Oh, there is. Oh, is it glitched out? I can see that health bar,

1803
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:23,800
that little green. What's going on? Thank you for the tip, Anna. Wait, I think it's glitched out.

1804
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:30,200
This is an old game. Hold on. Let me do this. I'll do it with a bigger one.

1805
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:42,200
Uh, game. Game, you're showing your time. I've never actually had it glitched out here before.

1806
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:55,240
Right. I had to press F on the keyboard. I don't know what button I was supposed to press on the

1807
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:01,320
freaking, I'm, I would, oh, I keep saying it. Literally, where do you've got to get to higher

1808
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:10,840
ground? I literally F in the chat. That's, oh, oh, oh, you're getting whacked, mate. Oh, then you fall

1809
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:18,840
now. Oh, he's hiding in the freaking bushes. Right, healing up, healing up, healing up. Don't

1810
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:25,320
worry, don't worry. Uh, actually, I think these are much faster. Yeah, these are one shot. The

1811
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:32,360
dual wield is one shot, but the long stick isn't one shot. Hmm, what does that mean?

1812
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,480
Right, okay, we're just going to press the keyboard. We're literally just switching

1813
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,280
between the keyboard and the ticket thing. I don't know what I'm supposed to press.

1814
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:48,200
Get whacked for free, must be nice. Is that the honor you should be watching by any chance?

1815
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:55,960
Hmm. Uh, right down we go. I don't know. Are you squiddin' me right now?

1816
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,960
Virginia! Have you considered getting to higher ground?

1817
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:05,880
Stop! No, I'm getting trolled! Thank you for the tip, for so. He repeats it so much,

1818
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,960
but he's not doing it right now. I wonder, because I don't know why he's not repeating it,

1819
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:18,840
but I kid you not, he constantly repeats, you have got to get to higher, you have got to get to

1820
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:26,600
higher ground. Over and over and over and over. But, uh, I think we're actually being given,

1821
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:35,560
oh, objective. The classic three and done in video games. If Aintbroke don't fix it,

1822
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:42,280
do this thing three times and you win. Delicious. Delicious, delicious, delicious.

1823
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:52,600
Love it. I love it when game devs get the memory. Oh my god, I'm inside that! I'm inside it! Leave

1824
01:24:52,600 --> 01:25:03,240
alone! No! Oh no, I'm a... Oh, that's not good. I'm having a seizure.

1825
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:16,360
Home tree! Oh, wait a minute. I think I might have died and now I'm at home tree and I'm about to be

1826
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:21,720
spiritually be a navi. Like, yeah, spiritually. I'm like physically about to be like 100%

1827
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:33,400
navi if I remember correctly. Oh yeah, that's right. Oh, I can feel myself connecting with nature.

1828
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:38,440
Oh, I should...

1829
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,840
Are you with me right now?

1830
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,280
Wah!

1831
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:04,200
Heck yeah, speak for the trees. Thank you, Tim Shotol. For the tip. I can never say that

1832
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,280
name right. Shotol. Ah!

1833
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:18,120
Eh, AWA just resurrected me and AWA's word is truth, so I will not be taking any contesting

1834
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,960
points that I'm no a navi anymore.

1835
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:29,640
Actually, I really enjoyed the second Avatar movie because what's her name? The one that

1836
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:34,120
is Sigourney Weaver as a child? I really like her plot line.

1837
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,280
Eh, that she's like, can commune with AWA? I really like her.

1838
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,240
Avatar Stoney has an arrow under her hair!

1839
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:57,640
There's a second Avatar movie? Yeah, it's called Way of the Water.

1840
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:02,040
Did you not get advertised on anything?

1841
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:10,440
There's a second Avatar movie. It's out right now. I may have just spoiled it for you. I apologize.

1842
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,360
If I was home tree, I would tell Stoney to...

1843
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:23,560
If I was the home tree, I would tell Stoney to... I don't know what he want.

1844
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:28,120
What are you on about? What are you on about?

1845
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:34,520
This is a spiritual location. You can't loot the home tree.

1846
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:40,120
Okay, I say that as if there isn't a Gen 2 concept right now that may or may not have

1847
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,600
have some nun influence.

1848
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:50,600
You cannot do any activated mission things. Oh, it's the guy!

1849
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,920
Nothing but more than pure digging.

1850
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,280
My new abandoned name.

1851
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,560
Advertising for the second movie was a booze ball.

1852
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:10,200
It still did really well, did it not, if I'm not mistaken?

1853
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,120
Are you underestimating the power?

1854
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:22,440
You acting like the tree? Well, it's the Holy Spirit of Navi.

1855
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:30,600
Okay, we are going to Swatulu. Anyone else visited Swatulu?

1856
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,080
Maybe on spring break you went to Swatulu?

1857
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,800
Yeah, they are absolutely wrecking this place.

1858
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:42,680
This is not... This area is definitely getting absolutely wrecked.

1859
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,680
I just remembered what happens in this area. I'm like Nightmare Potenture.

1860
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,480
Very good location because something very cool happens.

1861
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,640
We aren't searching for the dormant site.

1862
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,920
No, actually, I think it's a later level, you know that?

1863
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:07,880
Anyway, it's cool.

1864
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,000
The first movie itself was already advertised enough for the second.

1865
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,600
That's probably what they said.

1866
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:28,440
That was really outrageous writer, I'm going to be honest.

1867
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:33,640
Saying no hablo to a Navi. I don't know, that felt a bit weird to me.

1868
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,080
I don't think we should let that one slide.

1869
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,240
That was... That was motivated. That was motivated.

1870
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,840
That was bizarre.

1871
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:46,280
And if you're literally fully Navi, you're not going to put effort into speaking Navi?

1872
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,360
We're going to unlock the home vision tree. What the heck is that?

1873
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:56,040
Oh, it's a tree of vision. Oh, it's a sector challenge.

1874
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,240
Am I crazy or was there a horse I could ride back here?

1875
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:08,360
Thank you, child, me for remembering. Oh my god, I'm actually so smart.

1876
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:11,480
What are you? You're just menacingly guarding this horse.

1877
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,400
Can I just take it? Thanks mate, appreciate it.

1878
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:34,920
There are RDAs, but the beautiful thing about these parts of the map,

1879
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,760
you can ignore it. You can just zoom ahead.

1880
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,840
This is one of those games where if you want to take your time and explore it,

1881
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,880
you most certainly can. But if you just want to be like,

1882
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,720
right, I want to do the objective. I don't want to leave the horse in the middle of here.

1883
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,240
What am I doing here? Oh no, I don't want my horse to...

1884
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,960
Wait, investigate. Oh, I'm only to do a drive-by?

1885
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,440
Oh, I can do a drive-by shooting all right. Don't mind me.

1886
01:30:59,240 --> 01:30:59,880
Oh, let's go.

1887
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,200
Right, I don't think you can shoot well on horseback.

1888
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,760
Sorry, dire horse. It's called dire horse.

1889
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,560
But yes, I don't mind doing a drive-by.

1890
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:16,360
Right, left or right? Both are terrible.

1891
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:21,320
This one's a dead end, so do the dead end first and then come back for the open one

1892
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:25,880
because it's likely that the open will be like the next progression.

1893
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,880
Oh, my wee horse is getting injured.

1894
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,920
Shattered village. Yeah, looks absolutely desolate.

1895
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:40,600
Okay, I think the game's putting horses around the map in case we do end up losing.

1896
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,520
Can you put like samples on horseback? You cannot.

1897
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:50,040
Flex and then roll in arse. What do you mean you cannot roll your arse?

1898
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:53,960
Can you not iterate what you wish to rock on?

1899
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,720
I'll just start shoving ours and words that don't even have it.

1900
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,760
Oh, my poor horse. Oh, it's a mech. It's a mech. It's a mech.

1901
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,160
It's a mech. Oh, the horse is going to perish.

1902
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,040
Oh, no, the horse is perishing this game. I don't like it here.

1903
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,200
Let's get out of this place.

1904
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,880
Is this the first game? It is. This is not the new game that came out.

1905
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:19,640
This is the Archaic 2009 game.

1906
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:25,400
Loongeree is not here. Where is Loongeree?

1907
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,360
Loongeree, where are you, mate? I need to find Loongeree.

1908
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:38,920
Any Loongeree fans? I'm a Loongeree fan. Oh, the horse is getting in.

1909
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,680
Loongeree's gone to stop them.

1910
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:47,400
With Unipee. That's right, Riflin.

1911
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,000
Oh, Unipee's a person.

1912
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:00,280
Oh, what did we unlock? Let's see. The Onatopak.

1913
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:05,080
What is that? That looks like shards from the sky.

1914
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,840
That looked cool. I've not actually summoned a horse.

1915
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:12,600
What was that? Birds from the sky? Column Pandora to help strike.

1916
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,360
Oh, my God. Hold on. What does it look like?

1917
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:24,120
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Little baby. Little baby clangs.

1918
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:28,040
Okay. Great. We can go through here.

1919
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:35,400
Oh, I'm getting shot at. Or is he shooting at an NPC? I don't know.

1920
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,840
Hello. Do you need assistance?

1921
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:45,400
She just expired. I don't know. I don't even speak Navi.

1922
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,280
I don't even know what her last words were. Oh, my God.

1923
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,600
Her family's going to be like, what were her last words?

1924
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,880
And I'm like, I'm so sorry, mate. I'm actually a skypey poll.

1925
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,960
You're going to have to forgive me, but is there an enemy there?

1926
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:04,840
No, that's a boss. Where's the enemy? That's actually really embarrassing.

1927
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:08,920
Yeah, we don't know her last words because I'm a dumb dumb.

1928
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:12,600
We're playing that. Hello. Are you okay? Are you squiddin' me right now?

1929
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,520
Brian! I really like the second Avatar movie,

1930
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:21,000
especially the scene where they destroy almost everything that was achieved in the first

1931
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:22,520
True.

1932
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:31,400
Okay, Iron Reaper, thank you for the tip. I'll admit, true. However, I present to you

1933
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:37,480
Sigourney Weaver's second storyline, and that's fine with me.

1934
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,360
I like that she's connected to Pandora, can control Pandora.

1935
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:43,560
Okay, to Awa, and Awa grants her those abilities.

1936
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:50,920
I don't think she's doing well. Are you going to expire after we finish talking?

1937
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:59,880
Because I can't translate your last words to tell your to tell your family.

1938
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:09,560
Oh, um, maybe you should expire because that's actually really great.

1939
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:13,480
That's really rude. Please don't do that.

1940
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:34,760
I need to claim. Please perish. Oh, my bow and arrow is not strong anymore whatsoever.

1941
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,800
I used to one shot these guys. It's now costing two ammo.

1942
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,800
Right, so what we have to do is just climb up these and then jump aboard when it comes

1943
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:58,600
background, and then we destroy its receiving signal thing, which completely, um, okay, yeah.

1944
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:03,080
Do you remember when we played Elden Ring and there is that chariot thing and you had to

1945
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:11,640
drop down on top of it? Basically that. We just need to slowly wait for it to turn.

1946
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:18,680
Yep, okay. And then when we get close enough, we just jump down.

1947
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,560
Wait, can I not just, can I not shoot that with bow and arrow?

1948
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:31,720
I feel like with their height difference, I could probably bow and arrow that.

1949
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,400
Uh-huh.

1950
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,600
Nope. Can't believe Elden Ring stole that idea literally.

1951
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:49,720
Uh, right. I think that's just showing, I need to go up on this one.

1952
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:53,080
What do you go up on this one? I can see it on the mini map that I'm covering up with my big

1953
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,280
hair, but the mini map, I wish I could put the mini map in the other corner.

1954
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:59,640
I'm always covering up the mini map when I play games.

1955
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:05,480
Uh-huh. Hopefully doesn't bother you guys. I assume it's coming around this corner very slowly.

1956
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,720
Something's trying to shoot up.

1957
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,480
Are you coming? Hello?

1958
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:21,240
Is it stuck? Am I out of its distance to move? Right, you, I can hear you shooting.

1959
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:28,840
Knock it off. Stop moving. Oh look, the picture plant. Look, it's sending flies out to hurt him.

1960
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,440
Death by flies. Death by flies. Oh, he's in. Did he come? I didn't know they could use,

1961
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:38,040
no, come back. You need to perish by flies or by bow and arrow. Pick.

1962
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Fane. Okay, I'm out of the distance. Right, is this not, is it stuck? Why would it be stuck?

1963
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,040
Oh, fane. I think we're maybe too early.

1964
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:58,040
Watch it start moving when I come around this corner.

1965
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:05,960
Yeah, I was kind of joking. I was actually joking, but I seriously did it. I knew that.

1966
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,200
Where's the freaking bane? Where's the bane?

1967
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:22,760
Moving again because I'm out of your render distance.

1968
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:30,280
I am being pranked. I am being pranked. Wait, did it move?

1969
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:38,840
Wait, that is it there. That's it right there. The render distance is broke.

1970
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:47,160
Bro, it's going to start moving. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me get up the dang thing.

1971
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:56,520
Oh, that's literally the only song I know off by heart. It's actually really sad.

1972
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:06,040
There is an anime called Avatar the Last Airbender and Uncle Iroh is an absolute beloved character

1973
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:12,760
and he sang a really moving song. It's literally the only song I know off the top of my head.

1974
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:18,440
But it's like beautiful sad, not like hopefully not too sad sad, you know?

1975
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:26,600
I need to not bring that song up anywhere close to making here. We can not allow it to spoiler.

1976
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:32,200
Has Emi not seen it? Please stop it. I'm going to cry. Okay, okay, okay. We pause. We pause.

1977
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:40,520
I didn't realize there were bad guys here. Take this and this. Why am I taking so much damage?

1978
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:45,000
I don't know. Have I unlocked a new outfit? No, I haven't.

1979
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:50,840
Wait, do you see that stat increase though? So as we unlock new outfits, it's going to go up so much.

1980
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:56,440
You mean you don't? I don't know Secret Tunnel off by heart. Secret Tunnel. What am I supposed to do?

1981
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:02,120
I'm supposed to do something. Hold on. Ah, I see the blossoms.

1982
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:14,840
Two lovers forbidden from one another. There's a mountain in the way.

1983
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,360
And I kind of forget how this next part goes.

1984
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:30,280
Secret Tunnel. Brian, I'm singing.

1985
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:40,120
Emi's planning on doing it. So she's definitely support emu's when she does that. Definitely.

1986
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,120
Thank you for the tip, Nero.

1987
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:54,760
I kind of forgot how this next part goes. Can you guys put the lyrics in chat and then I'll like

1988
01:40:54,760 --> 01:41:00,040
sing it to you guys. Shawnee, why have all the Scottish people met? Also nice.

1989
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:05,720
Why are Scottish people nice? Oh, we're just, we're just vibing.

1990
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:11,240
Scotland, Glasgow's been rated one of the nicest. Oh, we've got level up. We've got level up in our

1991
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:18,440
healing and our sprint. So are we like even faster? Oh, wow. Okay. Okay. That was a pretty

1992
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:23,640
decent distance. Are you actually a blue guy in this game or are you a skin walker like the movie?

1993
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:31,560
We have, our human body has died. It got annihilated via missiles. So yeah,

1994
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:37,400
we're like, we're Navi now. We're just trying to get accepted by the Navi and to reverse the

1995
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:49,720
horrific effects that I'm actually not very skilled at this bit. Oh, jeez, Louise. Oh my god,

1996
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:54,440
they like ate my health up so quickly. So this is what I mean by you get a second chance.

1997
01:41:55,320 --> 01:42:04,200
I now have four second chances. Oh my goodness. Get right. He's perished. Oh my gosh, that was

1998
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:13,320
right. He's off of it. I don't know if I need to like unironically XP grind or something.

1999
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:25,400
I feel like I die. I think I'm okay. Where are we? Where are we? Oh my gosh.

2000
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:33,240
I don't remember the game being so hard. Do you know that? I'm just getting over here like,

2001
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:37,560
bro, I'm out. You don't need to worry about me. I'm gone. I'm in and out like a flash.

2002
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:46,520
Call me you same boat. I'm gone. 10 seconds. No, not leaves from the vein. The other one,

2003
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:53,800
the happier one, the two lovers one, not leaves from there. That's a sad one. Scots are nice until

2004
01:42:53,800 --> 01:43:04,520
you tear us off. Honestly. Oh my god. Yeah, I'm trying not me to. We don't want to be sad up in

2005
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:16,920
here. Good times. Good vibes. Two lovers forbidden from one another and the moon ends in the way.

2006
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:22,280
I have no idea what it is. Stroney, you just channeled some intense dark souls energy by spam

2007
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:27,160
rolling away from the attackers. Honestly, though, I should probably pick up cell samples

2008
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:33,000
because I ended up using two revives for that. I definitely need an armor upgrade,

2009
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:45,880
because. Okay, ready to lovers forbidden from one another award their people

2010
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:58,200
and a man and evades them apart. You must build a path to be together.

2011
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:06,760
And I kind of forgotten how the rest of it goes, but secret tunnel, secret tunnel.

2012
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:18,600
It's such a good song. There we go. A little sing song for you. A little karaoke before the

2013
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:26,680
actual karaoke stream is planned. Have a look. I've got to stop. That will get stuck

2014
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:33,000
in my head for months. Oh, do you want the Scottish version of it? So it's extra cursed.

2015
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:37,880
Wait, someone refit the lyrics in again, and I'll do the Scottish version for you,

2016
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:44,600
because I'm just so kind like that. Okay, so the one thing about close combat is the instant.

2017
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:50,360
I said the instant die. Thank you. Right, Scottish version.

2018
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:57,240
If someone puts the lyrics in chat for me, just so I can go. My brain's a little slow.

2019
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:12,120
Two lovers forbidden from one another award evades their people and a man and Brian,

2020
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:15,720
you're interrupting my singing, Brian. Well, I'm getting absolutely.

2021
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:19,800
Award divides their people. All right. Oh, sugar. Thank you for the tip.

2022
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:25,960
I'm getting too distracted. I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes.

2023
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:33,480
Thank you for tipping that. You didn't have to tip that. Thank you. I do appreciate anyway.

2024
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:38,840
Right, right. Scottish version. Two. Wait, should I do really neasily, Scots?

2025
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:53,320
Two lovers forbidden from one another award evades their people and a mountain divides them apart

2026
01:45:55,320 --> 01:46:04,520
and build a path a be together. Yeah, and I forget who the next couple of lines go,

2027
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:17,480
but then it goes. Secret tunnel. Secret tunnel through the mountain. Secret, secret, secret,

2028
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,640
secret tunnel. I think I need to go and visit for this next section.

2029
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:28,280
Anyway, that's the Scots rendition. You're welcome for that on the house. Didn't even have to pick.

2030
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:37,560
Why Bonaro? Why? I'll go invisible if I'm going to end up perishing, I think. Whoa, whoa, whoa,

2031
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:44,280
whoa, whoa. Okay. These turrets on the wall are my biggest enemies. Got a lot of enemies and it's

2032
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:49,400
the turrets on the wall, not the actual thing. Strana, just had any idea for your outfit. What

2033
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:56,040
about a version with all of your modesty plasters are replaced by nicotine patches, honestly?

2034
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,680
What is going on? I don't, sorry, I really don't remember this section, so I don't know what I'm

2035
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:10,680
up against, but I'm just going to take it slow. Not knowing we're taking it a bit slow. I'm just

2036
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:16,200
a bit, I can see something over there. Oh, he's destroying the car. I see empty mechas.

2037
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:25,560
What's that up there? Can I destroy these for XP? Hold on.

2038
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:36,680
Oh, wow. Oh, I'm doing a task sector destroying empty mech. Oh, wow, they explode as well. That's

2039
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:42,200
actually really good to know that they explode. Okay, there we go. I press X to do that, ultimate.

2040
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:48,840
Strana, do I smoke? No, I just talk too long and my voice is fried. Do you need help with this?

2041
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,760
You want to gang violence this car because you're like taking your sweet time. That's going to blow

2042
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:59,320
up, bro. That's going to blow up. Oh, it didn't hurt him though. Oh, I get a lot of XP for doing

2043
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:05,880
that. I don't know if we need to farm yet. If we get too weak, we'll farm, but at the moment we are

2044
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:11,400
above the thingy. Watch out. I know what challenge to destroy something.

2045
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:23,720
This looks very battle, don't ask, but I don't recall. I just heard an Ikram. I think that was an

2046
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:29,080
Ikram. Is this the person we need to find? Because I don't think he's looking too good.

2047
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:32,440
Are you okay? Yeah, you need, you need, oh, he needs some milk.

2048
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:39,800
Right, I'm sorry. It was too obvious, right? That's how you get wrecked.

2049
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:47,080
Don't want to get hit that much, but it's literally the best I can do. All things considered.

2050
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:52,440
Okay, that special attack knocks them over. That's really good to know. Okay.

2051
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,400
Heal, heal, heal, heal. Okay, that bought me time, that bought me time, that bought me time.

2052
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:02,680
Okay, two out of three. Wait, that didn't damage me? That explosion didn't damage me.

2053
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:09,000
Okay, let's go. Okay, okay, that wasn't that bad. I thought that was going to be like

2054
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:16,840
insane battle door mask type stuff, but we're safe. Strony's inky milk. Strony's inks milky. Hold

2055
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:23,960
on a minute. Someone, someone described my homemade yogurt as glippy. I have not forgiven

2056
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:29,160
you for such descriptions since. Is there an enemy over here? Whoa.

2057
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:42,360
The fricking, the, wait, how much do I have to redo? Because I was like deep in that. Okay,

2058
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:49,640
I don't have to redo much. The plane took me away with it. I bumped away, man. I bumped away,

2059
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:56,360
bro. As far as I'm aware, this game has infinite lives. I probably would never have finished it

2060
01:49:56,360 --> 01:50:04,360
if I didn't because, you know, I didn't make it. Glippy. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2061
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:10,920
I didn't, that is so cheating. They have, they had pre-spawned in. Go away. You can shoot me through

2062
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,680
that because I can't shoot you. I'm going to have to be in viz to claim up this. Oh my gosh.

2063
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:20,440
Where did, where did they go? Right. I need to...

2064
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:30,040
Oh, lovely. Okay, there we go. Yeah, I'm not one shot nothing.

2065
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:40,280
Just so the screen isn't too red. There. Jeez, Louise. Oh, I almost didn't make that. Can I

2066
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:44,520
destroy this? Oh, I can. Take that. I didn't get any XP for that. So

2067
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:51,400
that's great. Something. Honestly. Oh, my Icaran's here. I thought my Icaran was going to come and

2068
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:55,160
get me. Okay, it's because it's exploding. My Icaran is coming to get me.

2069
01:50:55,160 --> 01:51:11,240
Okay, let's see what we're working with. Whoa. I don't like that.

2070
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:20,440
I messed up. I'm sorry. I even brought attention to my existence.

2071
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:27,000
Please, please, please. I'm just a Navi. I'm just a, I'm just a sweet innocent Navi.

2072
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:32,760
I'm sorry. I tried to pick on you, Mr. Car. I'm sorry. My goodness. That Warthog is powerful.

2073
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:44,440
Oh my goodness. It was just a little arrow. My gosh. And let me up. Literally light them up. I

2074
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:53,160
want that thing up. Blast it out of the sky. Oh my goodness. That was not good. Right. You're

2075
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:59,480
standing up now. So you feel a bit better. Good. Oh, a great warrior. Oh, you were hating on me

2076
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:05,080
about 20 minutes ago. Hmm. Don't think I, I didn't forget. You're, you're a little hatey.

2077
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:13,400
Okay. Goodbye. Oh, I'm called Dreamwalker now. I'm no longer a sky people. I'm a dream.

2078
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:20,520
So let me shoot an arrow at this armed vehicle. Look, I have some good ideas and I have some

2079
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:31,080
bad ideas. That was a bad idea. Oh, oh, there's, what the heck is this? What did I do with that?

2080
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,200
Oh, we got an unlock. What did we get?

2081
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:43,640
I'll look up. Invis for longer. Oh, we've got a bow and arrow upgrade and a weapon upgrade. Oh,

2082
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:48,280
look, her bow has changed. Look, it's a different design now. See, that literally

2083
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:51,560
is such a cross game. Right. What am I supposed to do with these crystals? Excuse me.

2084
01:52:55,720 --> 01:53:01,880
I'm actually, here we go. I guess I'm to follow the crystals because it's doing the little light.

2085
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:10,600
So, okay. It's to follow it. I was, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. We're safe.

2086
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:16,360
My goodness. I don't know what I need in order to survive other than an armor upgrade,

2087
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:21,160
but those warthogs are so unforgiving. I was a mecha as I've unlocked now.

2088
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:24,520
See, we're starting to get out of the tutorial where the game does not forgive.

2089
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:29,880
Like the game will annihilate you if you don't like level up and stuff.

2090
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,720
Oh, my horse is getting really shot out there. I didn't like that. I didn't enjoy that.

2091
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:38,600
More enemies. It's impassable.

2092
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:49,640
Oh, for God's sake. No, Mr. Horsey. Please do not. Wait. Gang violence. Gang violence. The horses.

2093
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:55,720
Oh, no, my horse. Oh, my horse just perished, but I saw him attack on the leaf. That's two games

2094
01:53:55,720 --> 01:54:02,120
where the horse actually helps you. Okay. We're just going to have to take the rest on foot, sadly.

2095
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:10,840
Oh, oh, do they attack me if I'm Navi? I feel like. Oh, oh, it's so beautiful.

2096
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:19,560
Yeah, I really don't want them to attack me. I'm definitely picking up.

2097
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:23,160
Rider, come in. I've only got a few seconds to talk.

2098
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:28,200
Falco's gathering harmonics to find something called a well of souls. Well of souls.

2099
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:34,520
You don't say. Falco's planning to use it to wipe out the Navi. I'll try to find out more.

2100
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:42,200
I was hoping they didn't attack. I was hoping they didn't attack. Oh, I've gone the wrong way.

2101
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:46,200
I'm getting too distracted. Oh, I don't want to hurt the whale blade. It just sucks.

2102
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:52,440
Wait a minute. What did she call me? Raider? I hardly even know her.

2103
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,480
Oh, you didn't. You didn't like that one? I guess. Yeah, I guess I repeated it. I'm sorry.

2104
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:08,200
Yeah. Okay. I won't recycle jokes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2105
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,800
Is that? Oh, I can't see.

2106
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:18,600
Okay, I'm sorry, but you guys are going to have to go.

2107
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:24,360
I really wish they wouldn't attack. Oh, hello. Are you the person I need?

2108
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:33,720
Man who is not man, a Navi who is not Navi. You are a puzzle, piece of Ewa's puzzle.

2109
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,240
Oh, okay. I'm dreamwalking. Are we got an upgrade?

2110
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:48,040
I thought no scrawny stream today. Are you sure about that?

2111
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:55,320
She be a reminder. Okay. For those of you who are listening in are a part of the hair M.

2112
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:00,600
She be cotton bum is going live in T minus.

2113
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:04,040
Four minutes. She may actually be on the loading screen.

2114
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:12,840
Eh, but yes. If there's any new YouTube mods lurking, you are welcome to speak,

2115
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:16,680
but then I remove your speaking privileges instantly.

2116
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:22,760
Class of 09. What is Class of 09? Have you guys played that?

2117
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:26,760
scrawny streams never end. The return all hail the endurance cut off is.

2118
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:31,880
As I play the Navi part, I did it later as a human.

2119
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:40,520
Wrong. I've literally never done the RDA save. We will take. Oh, look how beautiful this is.

2120
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,720
Literally glowing in the dark is just stunning.

2121
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:49,160
Oh, could you imagine it with graphics that are updated?

2122
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:53,560
Like, I have no idea what's in the new avatar game. Maybe we should play it for the first

2123
01:56:53,560 --> 01:57:00,680
time together, but I think it is as beautiful as this. Right. Why am I here? Oh, to get these crystals.

2124
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:05,240
Okay, we're just going to ignore.

2125
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:14,760
Because if we can just run in and out of these sections, if you hang around and kill anything,

2126
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:23,080
yes, you will get faster XP. Oh, I don't want my horse to die. I'm so sorry. Oh, Mr. Horsey,

2127
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:29,480
please don't die. Oh, no. Oh, no. Come on. We need to get out of here. Like right now,

2128
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:34,360
I don't want you to pass away. I want you to have a happy life and retire at your old age.

2129
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:41,720
Okay. And wait, this horse here is getting attacked as well. I was beating up that mech.

2130
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:45,480
I was going to actually take it so this one can live its little retirement out. But

2131
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:49,720
oh, I don't know if we're going to make it if they've got flipping flamethrowers and I've

2132
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:56,680
got the wrong way because again, all turned around. Oh, please live, little horsey, please live. Oh,

2133
01:57:56,680 --> 01:58:00,280
no, the horsey is not going to. Right, that's it. We're clearing this. We're clearing this out.

2134
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:03,480
Leave my horse alone. Everything is so strong.

2135
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:14,760
Who? Who? Who? You, perish. Gosh. I don't have anyone to take out my special one.

2136
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:19,960
Right, I'm healing because we're going to end this. Wait, I actually came out in your avatar.

2137
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:25,160
Yeah, there's a new one. Didn't check it out. Yeah. I'm going to take more samples because

2138
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:31,400
I've actually only got three. Wait, how far away? It's a wee bit away. It's a wee bit away.

2139
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:39,000
All right, we are going to pick up cell samples just. No, my horse was still going to retirement.

2140
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:45,320
You're so mean. Ow. Did that plant just smack me back?

2141
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:52,840
Fine. My horse is already passed away. Man, he had a pension fund and everything.

2142
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:57,480
Imagine working your whole life. Actually, I read a story about like that

2143
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:01,560
where someone like worked their whole life and they got one week of retirement and passed away

2144
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:07,720
and it was like, I would, I would be so mad. I would be so mad. I would explain to death himself

2145
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:14,920
like, look, mate, I've kind of sweat my whole life. Dread Brian. By the way, I'm not sure if it was you

2146
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:20,840
who asked, but it was someone invalid asked if the Black Ops two servers were fixed. Me. The answer

2147
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:27,880
is yes, the servers were fixed, but bear in mind, it's still the Black Ops two servers. If you know

2148
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:37,560
you know. I remember the game couldn't be played by streamers on the basis of like a super easy

2149
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:46,520
to get like your IP going. But if they fixed it, honestly, Black Ops with the boys. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2150
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:54,120
Have a little drink. Have a sipping tin. Thank you very much for the tip. Tarja, I appreciate that.

2151
01:59:54,600 --> 02:00:00,680
Yeah. Shawnee, the horse is only looking for three days anyway. Well, in Pandora, I'm going to hang

2152
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:05,880
with sheep now. Yes, have fun with sheepsters. She's live with Class of O'Nane, which I actually

2153
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:12,200
don't know what the good is about. Imagine had reals ifs that basically happened to. Oh, I'm sorry.

2154
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:19,720
But yeah. Oh, we must draw harmonic from tree.

2155
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:30,200
Oh, I think I know where this is going to go.

2156
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:46,520
Oh, okay, that line delivery was a bit. No, long glory. No, we fling.

2157
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I will say one thing for the VAs of this game, especially for older games in the past,

2158
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:03,080
odds are they had no idea what the scene actually had and they were just given a script and just said

2159
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:07,960
like they don't know the depth of the script or what occurred. It was only until like recent

2160
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:14,840
stuff like where actors can see live what they're performing. So follow the sound of vibrations

2161
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,600
and find tuning points.

2162
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:29,800
Okay, if there's three, it's probably going to be like identical. Yeah, okay.

2163
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:34,760
Wait, hold on. Yeah, okay. And then the last one's going to be like right here

2164
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:41,880
because of the way triangles work. Yeah, I love triangles. What's your yeah, yeah,

2165
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:47,640
you know what? Favorite shape. I'm going to give it in our rectangle triangle or rectangle for favorite

2166
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:53,000
shape. Oh, it's singing to me. Hold on. I feel like something mystical is about to happen.

2167
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:03,800
I'm actually getting a bit scared. I just checked. Oh, no.

2168
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:12,440
We must take this home back to home tree. It's a wooden delivery. Get it because of the trees.

2169
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:15,480
It was a wooden delivery.

2170
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:26,120
Oh, I came up with that myself came up with that comment myself. I'm so witty as a streamer,

2171
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:33,400
aren't I? I'm just going to start stealing your guys's like witty comments and then doing that over

2172
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:41,560
Oh, I have a new armor. New armor. Oh my god, girl game, girl game. Oh yeah, like the protection.

2173
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:49,800
What is vitality? More health. I have more health overall because of the armor. Yeah,

2174
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:55,560
well, you can see where they added more armor onto me. You have solved content creation.

2175
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:05,960
Oh, that's proper harmonized. Yeah, good luck hitting them.

2176
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:14,520
Armor barely covers anything. And honestly, like they are using right. We're going to home tree.

2177
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:15,800
Wait, we're going back to home tree.

2178
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:20,840
What? I'm about to report to them that. Oh, by the way, longer these dead.

2179
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:29,560
I'm going to cry from that joke literally what cry of pain or just like just like how ridiculous

2180
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:37,480
it was. Okay, we are going to be polite to Ewa and respect the home tree by not doing backflips

2181
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:44,440
all the way up the trunk of the tree. Okay. Oh my god, it's tree balls. We love tree balls.

2182
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:47,240
Let's just get very bright in here. I'm not going to lie.

2183
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:52,440
Do I need to recalibrate? Hold on. I'm like a professional streamer. I think I need to recalibrate

2184
02:03:52,440 --> 02:04:01,320
my muscles. Okay, there we go. Recalibrating, meet your virtual, recalibrate it. Oh, yeah.

2185
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:09,880
Sorry. Oh, we did actually report longer is passing. Okay.

2186
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:14,520
You have the song. No, no, how but yeah, I scored the

2187
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:21,080
not the thumbs up. That was so human of you. Please don't do that again.

2188
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:28,920
A little tap on the shoulder. Sing.

2189
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:35,880
What am I saying? Am I actually to say is this like a mini game where any like

2190
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:42,920
what on earth is this freaky stuff going on here?

2191
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:52,920
I don't even remember that at all. Thumbs up. Let's just try to come there.

2192
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:57,560
It is the first step in our path. How many steps we got?

2193
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:07,000
Find location is one step. Okay. Speaking to Ewa is another. Okay. This demands the need of a

2194
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:14,760
the first voice. Only the first voice awakens well of souls. So this is campaign mode getting

2195
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:21,000
explained to us. I totally know the plot inside out from this game. Yeah.

2196
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,600
Assassin's Creed. I know the plot of this.

2197
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:31,800
All I know is that we're doing good for the planet. Easy on the mumbo-jumbo stuff.

2198
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:34,280
No, please, even if not directed at me, they hurt anyway.

2199
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:42,280
What if the trees wanted to see a sick backflip?

2200
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:53,080
Mission complete. Mission complete. Oh, not to jump around. Jump up. Can I put my weapons away?

2201
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:57,720
I feel like having weapons out in this location isn't very pleasant. No, put the RDA gun on me.

2202
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:05,960
Why is this so bright? I don't ever... Oh my god. I don't ever recall that issue.

2203
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:13,720
Hmm. Oh, hello again. I would like to talk to you for my next mission.

2204
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:16,280
We go to Toroknari. Toroknari.

2205
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:22,920
I hear the human Thalco seeks your death. We will not let this happen.

2206
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:26,600
You know, spending five years in cryo. Thank you, Tenjala.

2207
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:32,040
War is new to this world. It must not happen again. Never on the enemy side.

2208
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:34,520
But we're the goodies, so they're the enemy.

2209
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:45,640
We're healing nature. We're healing nature. Mother nature always reclaims all. Mother,

2210
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:54,600
mother, mother, mother nature. Oh, this looks like a dark room out. Beautiful.

2211
02:06:54,840 --> 02:07:01,240
Toph is the Marvel boy? I can't really do later voices like Toph.

2212
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:09,640
Oh, Katana. Look, there's the castle. That's what I would say if I could see

2213
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:14,680
something. If I wasn't blind. I can't really hear a voice at all.

2214
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:22,280
Is it a castle? There's something in the sand or the library? There's the library.

2215
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:28,120
Katana. Oh, sorry. It's not Katana. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2216
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:33,720
It's upside down, isn't it?

2217
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:43,400
Katana? Close enough. I know. I know. Katana wins. Good luck, Tenjala. Good luck, Tenjala.

2218
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:47,080
All right. Good luck, Tenjala. Hi. Oh, who's this? Hello. How do you do?

2219
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:51,480
You come for shards. That must wait. Oh, I need a pause on the shards.

2220
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:52,520
Post-trump on the shards.

2221
02:07:57,640 --> 02:08:00,760
A little cheeky hydration check. A little cheeky hydration.

2222
02:08:05,480 --> 02:08:10,680
There's the library. That's the way it would sound like the phone about the body.

2223
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:21,800
Longer speak. Oh, okay. I'm going to say something controversial.

2224
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:30,120
You know when maps are straight ahead like this? Yeah? I like that. I appreciate when games don't

2225
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:37,480
make you go back and forth and you just keep going forward. When a game makes you turn around

2226
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:40,760
to go do something on the map that you previously had that area.

2227
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:50,600
However, when a game makes it nice and linear,

2228
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:56,920
not going to lie, I almost fell off there. Oh, and I can't actually see where I'm supposed to go.

2229
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:03,720
Thanks to this leaf. Oh, here we go. Backtrack. Hey, yeah, backtracking a bit.

2230
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:13,560
Okay, let's see how it goes. Okay, so if you take the high ground,

2231
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:20,200
wait, look, that's why they attack me. They've got backpacks on the wolves and that's why they

2232
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:28,280
attack me. The RDA put like main control devices on the wolves and now they want to attack me even

2233
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:36,280
though I'm Navi. I'm Navi and I'm navigating. What the heck am I doing here? Am I destroying stuff?

2234
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:39,800
Don't have to ask me twice.

2235
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:48,120
What am I doing? Challenge complete, right? I'm going to do it from up here. Oh, I see.

2236
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:59,320
So I'm releasing the native Navi and destroying them. Jesus. Why? Yeah, we're like literally

2237
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:07,560
so low level. We're not even one shotting. Can I break you? Oh, I can't.

2238
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:17,160
I like how he just don't. Oh, he like dives over. I mean, honestly, if an arrow struck me,

2239
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:23,800
probably. Oh, we did it. Like Ori in the blank forest.

2240
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:33,960
I true. Wait, wait, wait. What am I supposed to do with that? Destroy it? I'm just going to pump.

2241
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:38,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me pump all the ammo into it. Where's my gun? I can't.

2242
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:49,800
Yeah, your height, you're teasing me. I'm not even hitting you, bro. You're literally right under

2243
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:55,880
the tree. I'm going to have to go. No, stop shooting me. I need to destroy this.

2244
02:10:56,280 --> 02:11:10,920
Hello. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Oh, no. Game. Game.

2245
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:20,440
Did I need to hit the other side of it, I guess? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

2246
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:23,560
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2247
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:31,160
Okay, done. Jeez, Louise. They are killing us here. That was very strange, but we did it.

2248
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:36,920
That's the main thing. Right here. We should not. Are you trying to shoot that guy and you're missing

2249
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:42,680
like horribly? Oh, you are. Oh, and I'm missing horribly too. You know that both of us are as

2250
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:52,360
bad as each other. He healed as I, bro, come on. Hello, would you like to talk to me?

2251
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:56,200
Oh, I'll just keep talking.

2252
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:09,000
Backtracking works if the map is good. Yes, I would argue yes. I did try and play Ori in the

2253
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:17,400
blind forest, but I was just too paid to pay go. It's definitely not a stream game for me, but one

2254
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:24,440
of the other girls most likely would play it. I feel like it's a, I definitely chill stream, chill

2255
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:29,960
stream. Yeah. This is actually a really beautiful map because you get to run along the little tree

2256
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:33,320
roots, which I really like. Yay, nature. Nature wins again.

2257
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:43,880
Uh, right. I can see, and we're maybe fighting here or are we,

2258
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:52,360
huh, are we just running through this? Oh, wow. We actually did pretty decent damage.

2259
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:57,800
Yeah. Wow. I'll take that. I don't, I don't, I think that was just a payable drill haul.

2260
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:07,240
Super. Are they cute? I can only, I'm okay. Hold on. I, it doesn't seem like an objective area

2261
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:13,160
because of that reason. I'm just going to do this. I know I shouldn't. I know I should probably like

2262
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:17,160
level up a bit, but I am very happy just to keep walking on the tree trunks.

2263
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:23,000
You want a non chill stream? Place a list. I've seen a lot of streamers place a list. Like,

2264
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:29,720
it's interesting to see what like, um, oh, I'm in trouble. Uh, oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, I'm in trouble.

2265
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:37,000
Oh my goodness. I do not remember being in so much trouble playing this game.

2266
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:42,040
What's the way? I think it's maybe I used to farm areas to level up and I was just so OP

2267
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:47,320
because I think this map, we're actually supposed to be unlocking a green

2268
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:51,560
armor right now, but I ain't doing it.

2269
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:57,720
Apologize dude. Just doing some backflip, literally backflip dodge and bullets.

2270
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:01,960
Right. We're getting ready to attack these guys, but I need to actually activate the quest by

2271
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:07,240
talking to this guy before we attack and release more of Pandora's. Me?

2272
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:14,760
How can I help? You would not like my answer. Listen, like it or not, you've got my help on this one.

2273
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:19,400
String. The tattooed lord of sky machines with weapons.

2274
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:24,840
Was it, I think for anyone who did actually watch the first Avatar movie,

2275
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,640
I think scum means like idiot or something like that. Like scum. You have to go like scum.

2276
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:30,680
Or else you're not saying it right.

2277
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:41,800
Yeah, I feel like I replayed and leveled up a lot more as a child and right now we're just like

2278
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:45,160
speedrunning through this. Although when you do complete a mission, you do get like a nice

2279
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:52,200
chunk of XP. So speaking of leveling up, I have a six minute timer at the top of the screen.

2280
02:14:55,160 --> 02:15:00,840
That looks like a protection spell that I am putting on. I didn't realize I unlocked some

2281
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:05,880
sort of protection thing. I definitely want to put whatever that is. Greatly reduces. Yeah,

2282
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:12,360
okay. Yeah, we'll definitely be utilizing that right woman to do. Right, let's test this out.

2283
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:19,320
I'm about to destroy the ship. Jump up here.

2284
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:29,960
Hello. Oh wait, I can just, yeah. Is this what I'm supposed to destroy?

2285
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:37,240
Oh yeah, okay, it is. Oh yeah, take that. You like that? Yeah, you're like a big adult. Oh,

2286
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:41,000
am I going to get a blood raid because it's facing me now? I'm getting, I'm getting shaky,

2287
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:47,480
I'm getting scared. Okay, we're fine, we're fine. Like honestly, smooth sailing. Okay,

2288
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:52,680
the NPCs aren't really locking onto me too well because of the distance. But we're making it,

2289
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:57,640
we're making it. They're getting a bit closer, so we might have to actually start shooting them

2290
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:03,960
a wee bit, just a wee bit. Oh, that was a good shot there. One more, and then that's three of four.

2291
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:11,160
You're telling me that quad aerial thing can stay up with three? I don't believe it.

2292
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:20,840
One more, two more. I'm not hitting that at all. It's not registering. I'm just going to spam it

2293
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:22,600
in. Am I supposed to go up?

2294
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:30,840
Of course, the thing I want is like not facing me. Is this one in the corner?

2295
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:35,320
Okay, there we go. Hey, wait, wait, I just, I'm looking at it.

2296
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:46,360
Sound like a human iron birdie, I'm just saying. Literally. The steel a crann is no match for me.

2297
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:52,040
I'm going to loot this stuff. I've got three revives. Oh my gosh.

2298
02:16:54,360 --> 02:17:00,120
Oh, the poor babies, they're not even attacking us. Out you come, baby. Wait, so, okay, it looks like

2299
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:12,680
regular ones don't attack me anymore. Hello? Yes. I think we're going to raid him.

2300
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:24,680
Oh, they're so cute. We're helping the little forest critters.

2301
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:31,560
What do you need? I'm sorry, medications for the big guy.

2302
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:38,040
Oh, just basic flowers. That's fine. I can get that. That's no problem. Hold on. Hold that thought,

2303
02:17:38,120 --> 02:17:45,720
little guy. I'm coming back. And then I think we get to ride him into battle like a horse,

2304
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:52,520
but it's not a horse. I think it's called a Thanator. If I remember correctly. Oh my goodness.

2305
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:55,640
I remember that time I said in this map, you don't have to backtrack.

2306
02:17:57,720 --> 02:18:02,360
Honestly, it's not that bad though, because it's to help an animal. And, you know, we

2307
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:07,160
shadow wizard money gang. We love healing nature from these parts.

2308
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:18,520
I'm going in. Oh, I'm getting sprayed and prayed, but they can't get me. I'm too good.

2309
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:27,640
Gather plants from the banshee's nest. Oh, that's what that is. I suppose we'd be comfortable with

2310
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:36,760
that. Pandora is Ohio, but more natural. You're not allowed to speak for the next 20 seconds.

2311
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:41,000
Do you understand me? Don't say that again.

2312
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:53,240
I'm so excited for your ace mushroom. I just want new earbuds for it. I hope it's not a

2313
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:59,160
disappointment. I most likely will not do ear licking. I'm just going to say that now before

2314
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:04,920
anyone gets thingied. I have no idea what an earth is going on with YouTube and ear licking at the

2315
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:12,120
moment. Something, there's either a policy update being pushed or something, but for some reason anime

2316
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:19,640
ear licks bad. In real life, human person ear licks fine. So I don't want you to be disciplined.

2317
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:24,360
I have put a lot of thought and effort into it, so hopefully the Acemari is good. I don't know how

2318
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:29,080
long I'm going to stream for. And the problem is I get really distracted when I constantly

2319
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:33,480
read your guys' stuff because you guys make me laugh all the time. So I'm not really sure how

2320
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:40,440
official an Acemari is going to be. I'll probably try hard for like 15 minutes and then it's just

2321
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:49,480
going to... Oh, that's so cool. Has Ava gone mad? No, Ava has blisters.

2322
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:58,840
Whiskers, honestly though. We whiskers. It's impossible because YouTube can't tell the difference.

2323
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:07,320
That's my theory at the moment is that anime is getting... because YouTube are saying it's implied

2324
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:13,080
else. Whereas we all know what actual ear licking sounds like because it's literally a 3D microphone.

2325
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:26,280
So it's really put in a bit of a hindrance on my plans. Oh my gosh. Is this not the coolest ride

2326
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:34,680
you've ever seen? Oh my god, it's so cool. Oh, he leaves. Can he go faster? Oh, he attacks.

2327
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:41,880
Oh, that's so cool. Can he jump? Oh no, that's not jump. Oh wait, wait. Do I move as it moves?

2328
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:52,440
Oh, oh man. Can you jump? Oh, I love him. He's so slick looking. Like genuinely so slick.

2329
02:20:53,880 --> 02:21:00,680
Not a hair on him. How do you keep warm? I'm fine. Like almost. Laughing was the highlight you'll be

2330
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:09,240
fine. Come on, buddy. Come on, whiskers. Let's get him. Wait, am I going back? Oh, I'm just going back

2331
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:14,040
to talk. It's just like, literally, it looks like he's been dropped in tar or the perv thing,

2332
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:18,040
but it's just how he is. A little hairless thing. I don't like hearing this kind of stuff.

2333
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:27,160
Okay. Why?

2334
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:33,800
Do not speak like you understand. Why is she so informal when talking to this guy?

2335
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:39,560
You have to pick your battles, B. This guy is speaking a second language. At least try and

2336
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:43,960
speak clear English, you know? So it's easier for him. Danny, go back before it's forward. Okay.

2337
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:49,800
There we go. You ready, whiskers? Oh, I did not mean to do that, but that was absolutely horrifying.

2338
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:52,200
Right. Come on, whiskers. Let's get him.

2339
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:02,200
Hopefully you have a lot of health, whiskers, because I'm not doing any combat at all.

2340
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:13,640
Ah, whiskers. Can you go across this stuff? You can. Oh, you're actually such a smart kitty,

2341
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:20,440
honestly. You're a smart kitty. Okay. I auto-jump if it's quite a... Oh, there's a

2342
02:22:21,080 --> 02:22:25,560
two, please don't attack, question mark. I don't think they attack me anymore.

2343
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:33,880
Speaking of contact, the enemy's got a lot of enemies. Okay. We're all good.

2344
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:38,760
Whiskers made it into a happy attack. There's another whiz... How many whiskers are there out

2345
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:44,360
there? There's so many of them again. Bingoes. Some mate like the...

2346
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:51,480
What is going on in the background?

2347
02:22:55,480 --> 02:23:02,760
Uh, cutscene moment? Cutscene moment, hello? Cutscene moment, hello?

2348
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:06,520
Oh, I think I'm stuck in it.

2349
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:17,160
Just absolutely chaos in the background, by the way.

2350
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:28,760
Endgame... Oh, and we've got to level up as well. Right, we need to help out that whiskers.

2351
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:34,440
Right, hold on. Leave whiskers alone. What's going on here?

2352
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:39,240
Stop it. Wait, what's going on?

2353
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:46,520
Right, I'm just going to do melee for the sticks. It's just so easy and quick.

2354
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:59,080
Why no health? Why no health? I'm doing my spell. Am I supposed to be on whiskers?

2355
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:03,720
I think I'm supposed to be on whiskers. Tear them up, whiskers! Tear them up!

2356
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:07,800
That's right. Who's a good kitty? You're going to get some treaties after this.

2357
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:16,200
I'm just going to do whiskers for the crazy in the background, honestly.

2358
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:25,000
Just a reminder that Sheevee Cottonbump is alive if you care to watch classes all night.

2359
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:35,400
Oh, this is so cool. Oh no, my kitty's losing health. I can't heal him.

2360
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:42,600
Oh, baby. I don't want you to perish. I want you to have happy retirement.

2361
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:50,680
Oh, there's no way kitty's going to deal with these mechs without being perished.

2362
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:55,400
Unless I put him away. Right, you stay there.

2363
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:04,360
Oh, my goodness. And I don't have my protection spell yet.

2364
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:14,600
I don't have protection spell. I'm literally... Oh, kitty, I might need you back. Kitty, I might need

2365
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:25,560
you back. Kitty, where are you? Kitty, you're saving me, kitty. Yes, knock them over. Yes! Yes,

2366
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:31,640
oh, you're so smart. You're so smart. You're so smart. Oh, you're such a good party party.

2367
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:36,440
Right, I do need to heal in a moment, but I think we're doing all right. What's going on here?

2368
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:40,840
You're... You've glitched out and you're not even fighting alongside me, so that's fine.

2369
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:49,880
Oh, the kitty... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

2370
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:58,520
Oh, I've casted protection. I've casted protection. I did crash protection, but I was too late because

2371
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:04,840
I healed first. I should have done it. Okay, okay, we can do that. This is super easy to get them.

2372
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:09,800
Where are they? Where's all the ones? Where are they?

2373
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:19,000
Two more? Oh, there you are. Okay, we're done. Oh, there's three more. I'm telling you, peppers.

2374
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:30,200
Hopefully, the cat didn't die then. Okay. Actually, I'm gonna... Oh, wait, no, this is

2375
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:36,520
okay. Right, okay. Yes, yes, yes, this turns to the corpus.

2376
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:43,080
I cast skill issue, honestly.

2377
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:56,040
Okay. Yes, we can do that. One more shard and then we do a song. A little song and dance.

2378
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:08,120
Oh, I crammed. Oh, that is really rough. That was a rough landing with the animation on the

2379
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:15,720
navi there. I have to admit, you're bending with the element there. Right, let's unlock the home

2380
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:21,080
tree. No, not home tree. Tree of vision, which lets you teleport around the map. Yeah, it was

2381
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:27,720
crunchy. That was crunchy. That was 2009 showing. I never know how long these bigger games take to

2382
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:34,200
develop. I still think it's like three years development, two years development. This smallest

2383
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:39,240
development game tank crunch I ever heard was Fallout New Vegas. That was like big like that.

2384
02:27:40,360 --> 02:27:47,640
I think they said it was 11 months development, which was crazy, all things considered.

2385
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:52,840
Uh, I think we just walked the rest of the

2386
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:05,320
Raider hardly even or anything else to brighten my day.

2387
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:08,840
Okay, so I'll stop making that joke. I'm sorry.

2388
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,600
It's a ticking time bomb. We can't let Fowler get anywhere near the well.

2389
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:17,640
She's can't keep getting away with it.

2390
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:25,720
Hey, am I supposed to find my Gornu? Are you feel health, kitty? Oh, you're not even

2391
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:30,440
readable, actually. I'm not supposed to read them anymore. Yeah, I know. I know. Right. I won't do

2392
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:37,080
it anymore. God, give it some bit. A 15 year old game. Look, look, look. They did actually come

2393
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:43,880
some pretty decent games like back then. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, Brian. Last one for

2394
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:49,400
today. I got to go night night. Good night. Thank you for the tip, Virginia. Good night,

2395
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:56,600
and I'll see you in the morning. How long are you two hours in? So statistically we have like

2396
02:28:56,600 --> 02:29:04,440
four. Oh, no, no one's sleeping in four hours. I'm a nation must die. Do you wish to help us or

2397
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:10,360
not? Yes, I'll help you, my goodness. Honestly, yeah, you actually do deserve a bit sass. Right,

2398
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:20,360
we're okay. Yeah, just go ahead. Whoa. What am I supposed? What animal? Am I supposed to eliminate?

2399
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:27,880
Oh, actual cutscene. Yeah, we do not get actual cutscenes like this often.

2400
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:40,360
Oh. Oh, sorry, I'm petting my hair right now. My hair is up in a bun.

2401
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:45,560
I'd rather that sounded rather old.

2402
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:53,960
Two and a half. Stony, you get one more of those jokes for all your jokes become unfunny.

2403
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:59,000
I don't have any more sound effects to do it with. I don't have any more sound effects.

2404
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:03,720
That's them all. So I can't make the joke again. I've only got crickets now.

2405
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:14,040
I really don't like hurting these guys, but if they're baddies, there's nothing I can really be.

2406
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:20,760
I give you, I send you back to Awa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's a lot more of

2407
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:27,240
you in this plane, this pen than I thought. Jeez. What am I supposed to destroy in here? That.

2408
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:39,480
Uh, I hope this works. Uh, I cast protection. I cast protect- I re-

2409
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:47,080
I'm stuck in the corner. I cast protection.

2410
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:55,320
Okay, thank God this game is so buggy. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to heal. I wasted that heal.

2411
02:30:57,480 --> 02:31:03,000
Oh, this is making me nervous. Haha, you can't come on the rock. You can't come on the rock.

2412
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:10,200
Most games for older games, elevation really bugs out the AIs that they have. So don't be afraid to

2413
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:16,840
use elevation to your advantage because then you get moments like this where you can just have

2414
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:23,400
a good time because they can't get on the elevation. Okay, for you. Glad that's over because that is

2415
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:29,960
really not an easy enemy to defeat in the world. My gaspan bug rug. Shawnee, you seem to have upgraded

2416
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:39,000
upgrades available top left. Wait, actually though. No, I don't, I don't, unless it's that.

2417
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,160
Greatly improved damage for a short amount of time.

2418
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:49,960
Hmm. Yeah, like for some reason, if you don't like tab over these, it'll constantly tell you you have like weapon upgrades and stuff.

2419
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:59,880
What else have I got? Yeah, so like things get more like stronger as we progress.

2420
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:04,680
I could do a club, honestly. Let's see the club. What does it look like?

2421
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:14,120
Oh, that's a meaty swing. Oh, that's a load up though to get that. That's quite a load up.

2422
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:23,080
Oh, yeah, that it doesn't. Okay. No, this is for these guys. It's the double. It's the double for me.

2423
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:31,000
Oh, why would you guys even be in a broken facility? Be honest, right now.

2424
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:37,880
Oh, why? How are you even getting me through a fence?

2425
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:44,680
Well, I need to aim. You need to reload. So which one of us is going to go down first?

2426
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:54,440
Yeah, the club's too slow. I'm just gonna go for it. Okay. Yeah, one shot with the things I'll take.

2427
02:32:54,440 --> 02:33:00,120
Is there anyone else here? I hear him. I hear him. I can't see him. Oh, he's so tiny.

2428
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:05,240
Oh, you're so tiny. I can't even see it. Ha, ha, ha. You're welcome.

2429
02:33:05,960 --> 02:33:08,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2430
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:11,560
Gang up, on, gang up, on. That's what I get for making a joke.

2431
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:15,560
Spank, spank, spank.

2432
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:21,640
Hello, scrawny. There was no notification for your human discord.

2433
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:29,080
Discord hates me. I can't believe it. I'm not discord's little kitten or whatever. I said anything

2434
02:33:29,080 --> 02:33:35,380
that thing. Shibi is live right now with Classable 9 if that game is more of an

2435
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:38,600
interest to you because I'm literally playing the most like unknown game ever.

2436
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:45,160
I don't know if this game out on PlayStation and that as well. I don't

2437
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:53,680
remember it being... oh there's a Thanator in here. Where is it? Oh I hear it. Where is it?

2438
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:58,880
Oh it's literally right there. We'll just spray it down.

2439
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:08,320
Oh I'm already out of ammo. Oh I thought I thought I thought I thought I was going to be like

2440
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:16,080
coded. Oh okay now he's not coded to go any further. I was going to say I'm like I didn't

2441
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:22,160
think it was coded to go any further. This is another thing about older games. You can like

2442
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:28,560
just absolutely smurf them because there's only so much game memory and game storage that they

2443
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:34,640
can allocate for areas which means coding wise they will just stop enemies from doing stuff like

2444
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:39,760
that. I just love it. I appreciate it so much. Like it just makes everything nice and easy.

2445
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:45,920
Peasy lemon squeezy. What you got to complain about? Huh? What you got to complain about?

2446
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:50,640
I know the game did come out on PlayStation 3. Okay okay so it wasn't... I didn't think it was an

2447
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:58,720
Xbox exclusive but I don't think it ever got released on Steam. What? I don't know. Hi it's

2448
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:05,120
done. It's done. Hydration check. Your own people would not have you so you come to us.

2449
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,960
I'm gaming. I'm not doing this for me. There's a lot more to cheese. I'm cheeseing it. I'm not smurfing

2450
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:17,760
it. Cheeseing it. Do you think I enjoy this? How much do I need to play for that? I've never

2451
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:22,720
done it. I've genuinely never done it. I don't think so you don't need to pay anything at all. I've

2452
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:32,320
gone to an RDA. I assume the RDA is just like congrats you've destroyed the planet thanks

2453
02:35:32,320 --> 02:35:41,200
and then the credits just roll. That's how I imagine the RDA side ends. Are you proud of yourself

2454
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:50,240
for beating a helpless NPC? Hold on I'm getting rolled. Oh my armor! I just noticed that my armor.

2455
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:55,120
Oh my god girl moment. Oh my god fashion show. Fashion. I've got a passion. Whoa look at that

2456
02:35:55,120 --> 02:36:00,880
protection walk. Are you squidding me right now? Today I learned that if you click on the hashtag

2457
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:06,240
smuttlefish hashtag in the stream description one of the first videos shown is the pufferfish

2458
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:12,080
gagging on a character video. Truly perfect. Actually thank you for the tip. Sorry y'all.

2459
02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:25,600
Oh that poor little guy. But yeah fashion show momento. So human basic armor. A little bit

2460
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:31,200
of an upgrade and then we've got like location based armor. I knew it so hopefully we can take

2461
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:45,040
a wall open now because are we faster as well? Oh who's here? Oh why are you here? This is Navi.

2462
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:51,440
I'm destroying Pandora just trying to input these guys. Let me put my glycs on. Can I see none?

2463
02:36:51,680 --> 02:37:02,160
I'm invisible. You shouldn't be shitting me anymore. I'm literally invisible.

2464
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:09,920
Am I going to heal naturally or do I need a pulp to heal? I need a pulp to heal.

2465
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:20,080
Take this. Oh I see the TNT thing. I'm going to grab the crystal before it gets me as I don't

2466
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:27,840
go to craft. Get me out here. Get me out here. Get me out here. Oh that sprint is so good. Oh my

2467
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:34,960
I just came out of nowhere. He blinked and he was gone. Oh need to pick up more samples. Oh get me

2468
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:39,840
out of here. There's too much. If they start having like knock back that's when it gets dangerous

2469
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:44,720
like being in the middle of the enemies. So do forgive me if I literally just blow past all these

2470
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:54,640
sections. Oh I can do that. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Okay okay we're we're getting

2471
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:03,040
so mo. Oh that's such a good thing. Ah see when they do that they stall you. That's when you get

2472
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:17,680
this. Oh no no no. It's literally TNT in the sky. Okay we made it. We made it. Let me just

2473
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:26,640
unlock this little tree of vision. You can't see me no. The vitality and protection boost.

2474
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:32,000
Yeah. What about the corp? Did you find out why they're pulling out? Why are you pulling out?

2475
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,080
Hmm. You don't want to pull out there?

2476
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:47,040
Okay we've got our second song so does that mean we need to do a third song and then we're

2477
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:49,360
who? Am I to talk to? The Banshee?

2478
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:52,960
Teleport?

2479
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:56,400
Wait what am I supposed to do?

2480
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:03,200
It's on to happen. It says yellow on the map. Am I supposed to read the ikran?

2481
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:12,720
No. I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention. The willow tree? The willow tree?

2482
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:19,840
Am I to use this to teleport to here to get to home tree?

2483
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:23,440
What?

2484
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:32,160
Wait was there a thing back? No not conquest. No not conquest. No no no no. We don't want to do

2485
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:36,480
conquest. You must do it at the end of the game. No no no. I already know how to play. Thank you. No

2486
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:42,000
conquest. Not now. Was there something I was supposed to pick up back there? I feel like I

2487
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:53,280
don't know. Child support scary. Is there a crystal? Oh dumb. Dumb dumb dumb dumb. Gee I wonder

2488
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:58,320
if it's supposed to go here on this conveniently place little island thing. Okay I was gonna

2489
02:39:58,320 --> 02:40:04,960
I need something. Now what was the third one here? Yeah okay okay don't make it too don't make it too

2490
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:08,240
obvious video game devs don't even need yellow paint in this game.

2491
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:18,640
Okay we have the song. My apologies. I was rather confused there.

2492
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:32,160
I'm becoming na-vi na-vi na-vi na-vi. You bring hope for the future. Give our call. We bring this song

2493
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:39,440
before ta-i. The battle moves swiftly. I fear humans are a step ahead of us. We must return song to

2494
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:47,120
home. Mercy's just DM'd me. Strongly my alt twitter's growing really fast. I'm scared

2495
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:51,680
but under the tweet I'm getting nervous. Should I post this?

2496
02:40:53,520 --> 02:41:05,440
Yeah you can post what you want. I'm gonna reply. Mercy you can you can post what you like my darling

2497
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:10,320
whether whoever makes you happy. Yeah I have replied to Mercy.

2498
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:19,360
Farah Yandere she sure does love being like on ironic this is gonna sound really weird when I

2499
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:23,120
say this out loud. She sure does love being a good girl and getting permission for everything

2500
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:32,640
Farah Yandere. Like literally all of the girls are so fantastic. And so we're slowly getting

2501
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:38,800
past the stage of do I need permission to do this? Because the answer is always no you do not

2502
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:45,120
need my permission you're in control. So I was the same. The best kind of Yandere.

2503
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:57,680
Yeah damn need some sunglasses to get up this tree. But yes the girls are definitely easing into

2504
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:03,920
the concept that because I assume you know they've consumed enough kind of like oh most

2505
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:08,160
future agencies like have this long list of rules that you have to abide by and it's like my rules

2506
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:18,720
are like literally you know be cool with lollipop stuff and no no male collabs and you know that's

2507
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:22,480
it. It gets really simple you do everything yourself I'm not going to tell you what to do I'm

2508
02:42:22,720 --> 02:42:28,640
going to dictate your content. So Brian. Yes you can post whatever you want my dear mercy

2509
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:35,520
leaks classified military documents war thunder style. I know about that if you didn't know

2510
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:42,720
military documents keep getting leaked in a video game because people are like they're like so

2511
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:46,320
like wanting everything to be correct which is hilarious thank you for the tip Farah.

2512
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:55,760
But that's like true real and true because what I'm sure one of them was like they were arguing

2513
02:42:55,760 --> 02:43:02,400
over a helicopter detailed design either in the cockpit or something to do with a helicopter

2514
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:09,680
and then someone was like so Tismo they were like no you're wrong and here's why and then they just

2515
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:17,200
like flop down these like documents that shouldn't be publicly accessible um and it's happened

2516
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:25,680
with the law. Okay we're singing a second song I'm going to assume by the third song we will progress

2517
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:33,120
to the next story part element is good good let me try a rumble nun will soon be found

2518
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:40,080
okay it's a little weird daily so many stuff challenger tank manlet armor but it

2519
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:47,360
in a Eurocopter shells etc it's happened 15 to 17 times

2520
02:43:51,520 --> 02:43:56,480
bro bro was like slams on desk see I told you so

2521
02:43:57,200 --> 02:44:03,680
now this gen is blessed truly guide you to your next like it wasn't even one country leaking

2522
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:09,280
the info it was all of them together just so that the the equipment and tanks and all that were

2523
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:14,000
accurate in game the next song there's literally a joke zero days since last military leak

2524
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:21,040
she sees what you may become they don't like to be wrong exactly great honor I'm just someone

2525
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:25,680
who gave me a song back home we call that a DJ oh he she just stroked his chest

2526
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:33,760
didn't you worry mate I just collect the songs look beyond the cup that's already full

2527
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:37,200
og san says as he drinks it means

2528
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:47,120
uh they are a Ramu a certain dominance honestly actually leaks really five and seven but other

2529
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:54,560
times they were export uh restricted but it could be found online I'm really proud to belong to the

2530
02:44:54,560 --> 02:45:00,800
war thunder community for their dastardly arcs the forest burns our warriors flee before the humans

2531
02:45:01,360 --> 02:45:09,200
these are drinking what hmm the rda must be gunning me and me I say actually all of them

2532
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:13,280
you know what well that's it all of them we can't escape the the p-corp jokes

2533
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:17,920
is the time to counter their attack or must be risked in times of need

2534
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:25,840
just all of them are at it honestly I mean if you think about it as there is milk heels

2535
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:34,160
so what would the other liquids do I don't know I don't know we didn't lure that that wasn't

2536
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:42,080
concepted but up to you what you think the other ones do uh what is this area I seem to have

2537
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:48,480
forgotten this map I actually don't remember it the warriors here know the land uh the obligatory

2538
02:45:48,480 --> 02:45:53,840
okay please be the last song because no more song missions please see if they can find big b we could

2539
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:58,480
use this big b all right just marry big b this much at this point I feel love them so much

2540
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:06,640
he enjoys crushing skulls of many tortu tortu or humans when you have all I want to have squid

2541
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:14,080
ink spaghetti is that because of me be honest time to find out hey oh strony you didn't have shebe

2542
02:46:14,080 --> 02:46:20,000
you didn't hear shebe's discussion about oh no actually this is one thing that I'm actually

2543
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:27,200
genuinely a bit sad about because I stream so much I don't have time to watch everyone's streams

2544
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:35,600
and it ups it like it genuinely upsets me like um I raided into mercy yesterday and she was playing

2545
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:40,800
oh mario or whatever the name of the game is oh I've never seen it or played it before

2546
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:48,080
and um she was like yeah I've been quite adorably but I just feel bad that like I don't have time

2547
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:53,040
like just everything like when I popped into ac stream playing that puzzle game obviously

2548
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:59,520
shebe's live right now I have terrible news but I don't have shebe uh in my ear right now

2549
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:03,840
that you guys can't hear whilst I game and stream and talk at the same time it's just not possible

2550
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:12,320
for me I do not remember this map at all I'm like um let's go for it let's see what this maps all about

2551
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:28,320
then what is this is this a run through type of thing uh no this is a search what is going on

2552
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:30,480
whoa this is pretty

2553
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:41,600
what is going on I need to learn to do that protection spell more wait why did the area

2554
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:48,160
just moved wait so am I supposed to kill those in the area let's go let's see yeah it's kind of

2555
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:54,480
shame that all your streams are overlapping I will say one thing I did ask the girls to push

2556
02:47:54,480 --> 02:48:00,240
on the first week to stream as much as possible however um some of them are going to settle into

2557
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:08,240
streaming um I literally said to them do not even dare stream every single day after this like you

2558
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:13,600
will be taking breaks that like I was I've lit and they can all vouch that I told them straight to

2559
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:19,360
their faces don't you dare stream every single day the only reason I can do it is because I don't

2560
02:48:19,360 --> 02:48:25,440
experience burnout the only reason I would not stream is if I am on death's door I'm not even

2561
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:31,920
kidding um oh that horse is beating me up they're jumping me wait use the ultimate use the heal

2562
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:37,680
heal heal heal my goodness you're so so what am I supposed to do here stop

2563
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:39,840
oh

2564
02:48:42,640 --> 02:48:46,240
I'm gonna need to take these um getting hurt by something um

2565
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:58,000
what am I getting hurt by I have no idea right wait why am I just to run around these sectors

2566
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:07,280
or just stop it oh there's more of them here I need to heal are you forcing them to take breaks

2567
02:49:07,280 --> 02:49:13,120
I'm not gonna tell them not to stream because that's not my place to do that but I will be

2568
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:20,000
worried if as time goes on like I've noticed one of them are like non-stop streaming

2569
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:28,240
but I will always like take their like if they say they're fine I'm not gonna question it I'm not

2570
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:32,400
I'm absolutely not gonna question it if they want to stream they can stream but I would be a bit

2571
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:37,840
worried like hopefully you're not like overdone you're safe because when I do it it's fine but

2572
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:42,400
when others do it hold on a minute I'm getting worried I'm I'm turning in a mother mode like are

2573
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:46,320
you okay uh is there something I could help you with is there like a reason behind the scenes why

2574
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:51,360
you want to stream everything you know I just want to make sure you're okay baby okay you're my you're

2575
02:49:51,360 --> 02:49:58,400
my wing you're my wing oh my goodness uh you literally just stopped me from doing that ultimate

2576
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:02,400
okay objective perfectly right okay we did it we did it

2577
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:10,720
take care of your daughters these uh unironically I've been getting nightmares about my daughters

2578
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:18,720
um I had a nightmare that I didn't redirect into one of them and then they wanted to leave

2579
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:23,520
violor because of that and I literally put in the message I was like am I real mummy now

2580
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:29,440
without her because I'm like I'm literally having nightmares like of like oh no something's not

2581
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:39,840
going right or like I've done something wrong are we babies here we go well like uh I managed to get

2582
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:46,560
streaming did no streaming detachment anxiety that's not the word is it oh wait am I supposed to go

2583
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:57,440
this way um separation anxiety from the reefing um that happened and I don't know if I'm gonna develop

2584
02:50:57,440 --> 02:51:04,880
it again for a little bit uh plausible but it's happened with the girls where when I go to sleep

2585
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:09,600
I get so nervous for them and like I'm worried like something might happen to them and I'm not

2586
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:16,480
there to like help them through it or something um but yeah yesterday was weird going after

2587
02:51:16,480 --> 02:51:20,080
the tulip remarks there was so much time in the day but the good news is I got a lot

2588
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:32,560
behind the scenes work done wait follow me uh I may or may not blast into that dialogue and I don't

2589
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:45,680
know I'm at his court her Mr. Horsey that was me twat wait what oh fucking spank you today what

2591
02:51:52,880 --> 02:51:57,680
them both in the goal I assume I'm gonna score in her too yeah okay this is like an escort mission

2592
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:06,640
about everything does she attack or does she not attack no she just stands there and lets me do

2593
02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:13,600
everything all right and ask you have it and lazy bum lazy bum lazy bum that's right I'm calling

02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:25,760
I swear in those it wasn't thing in the movies no it definitely is not is she getting attacked

2596
02:52:25,760 --> 02:52:26,560
no she's fine

2597
02:52:30,160 --> 02:52:31,200
she is getting attacked

2598
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:35,200
can you get

2599
02:52:38,720 --> 02:52:41,680
there

2600
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:46,320
right we can progress to the next one she's on a very caring mama honestly

2601
02:52:46,960 --> 02:52:53,200
she's got worries I'm like I remember my mom telling me when she had me she used to be a deep

2602
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:59,280
sleeper but when I was born she became a late sleeper and I'm like I feel that because I've

2603
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:03,600
not had like a really good night's sleep since debut oh before debut I didn't even have a good

2604
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:10,720
sleep either and the yap is the best part also in general a really cute thing for now is that

2605
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:16,960
they are yapping a lot but not a bad way no I love when the girls yap honestly it's like so nice to

2606
02:53:16,960 --> 02:53:22,320
listen to like their stories and and the situations have been in they've been in like quite humorous

2607
02:53:22,320 --> 02:53:31,120
situations um and it's just like fun to hear different people talk from like different walks

2608
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:38,560
of life like I know that sounds so freaking weird to say but like um it's just fascinating it just

2609
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:43,360
I don't know I just I just find it fascinating I feel like you can also learn a lot from people's

2610
02:53:43,360 --> 02:53:49,040
stories as well even if it's a humorous story normally there's some sort of like thing or

2611
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:53,680
element where they can look back and giggle and be like oh I wouldn't have done that no but like

2612
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:58,640
oh wasn't it funny at the time and like you know just little good things I should maybe do a

2613
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:04,400
reefling story time where we share stories and it'll be like sure like I would be have to be like a

2614
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:12,800
google submission thing and it's like oh share your um share like a memory that makes you embarrassed

2615
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:18,480
and like I'll read them out and then I'll share you an embarrassing story of mine um like that

2616
02:54:18,480 --> 02:54:22,320
kind of stuff I would absolutely love to do I feel like those kind of interactive streams are

2617
02:54:22,320 --> 02:54:26,400
quite funny and we can all like kind of have a wee giggle at each other also you guys must

2618
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:32,000
remind me to brush my teeth at the end of the stream I keep forgetting to brush my teeth

2619
02:54:32,880 --> 02:54:42,480
for that guy and um we need to do it together for 21 days so we can establish uh our beautiful

2620
02:54:42,560 --> 02:54:45,200
training uh yes

2621
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:56,080
hello rocks village behind village the shards are behind honestly me speaking french rocks behind

2622
02:54:56,880 --> 02:55:00,400
go got it I don't I've forgotten what behind is derriere

2623
02:55:02,320 --> 02:55:08,640
village derriereville and then rock is probably just like l rock

2624
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:15,920
I think there's not a will stand below

2625
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:28,560
or is this a fate is this a fate oh it's a fate it's on peer protection I'm literally a warlock

2626
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:40,400
peer protection oh we don't like fire fire bad oh get raked get raked get raked I'm getting raked

2627
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:45,600
I'm getting raked by the I leveled up though but I'm currently getting absolutely you can

2628
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:51,120
literally see the ammo shot that is coming from me from that freaking thing oh unlock new armor

2629
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:59,920
whoa I'm naked is that less protection oh no it's the exact same oh if it's the same as the green

2630
02:55:59,920 --> 02:56:10,240
one yeah we'll just use it um oh my god am I through your reload or something geez get me out

2631
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:14,640
of here I'm just gonna run ahead oh I haven't in this as well right we'll do in this

2632
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:19,920
try to speak as I say so it's not so

2633
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:25,280
literally I was green a minute ago with my armor and then it all disappeared and I'm like excuse me

2634
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:29,920
where's my uh protection via armor like you're telling me the navies still haven't figured out

2635
02:56:29,920 --> 02:56:34,800
that uh maybe we should literally have bullets or getting thrown and you're telling me the

2636
02:56:34,800 --> 02:56:41,280
navie haven't figured out that we should probably there is much they say you can do uh I can do

2637
02:56:41,280 --> 02:56:46,720
a shard nearby I'm going to drink a water you should think about hygiene near the east village

2638
02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:50,800
you must help we were attacked by humans many have died

2639
02:56:53,520 --> 02:57:02,000
you are not too late go find Alona when he can help and Mercy says uh I'm sorry I've accidentally

2640
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,760
stumbled into the algorithm on Twitter and I'm like congrats because I don't know how the heck it

2641
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:12,640
works either uh and a lot has been used to find all low new in in the village of to the east

2642
02:57:12,640 --> 02:57:21,040
the red feathers look pretty bad uh where are we going oh a bit of a bit of a walk oh no no

2643
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:29,520
not a bit of a walk well because there's a horsey horsey easy bear would you let me read you and

2644
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:35,600
say easy there like this dire horse from the hit video game James Cameron's avatar released in

2645
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:37,920
2009 um

2646
02:57:41,360 --> 02:57:46,080
how many resurrections do I have I've actually not been collecting much samples does that attack me

2647
02:57:46,080 --> 02:57:55,680
are you friendly oh well that got answered real quick didn't it whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

2648
02:57:55,680 --> 02:58:02,720
whoa whoa whoa whoa a bit too much action on these roads for me a bit too much not only I would

2649
02:58:02,720 --> 02:58:09,360
say my only complaint about this game is that you can never freely explore the land like things

2650
02:58:09,360 --> 02:58:14,000
constantly keep respawning which I'm not a fan of I quite like the idea of like clearing out an area

2651
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:18,960
and then it's like safe every time you like want to come back we're gonna unlock the tree of vision

2652
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:29,440
this game well this game did become PlayStation Platinum um uh apparently there's a multiplayer

2653
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:36,880
mode in this game I don't ever recall playing that as a child so it's running when is the history

2654
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:44,160
stream of yapping about the Irish potato family I was gonna do a teachers day where we have like

2655
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:50,640
40 minute or well maybe 30 minute classes so we do like English study and then we do like a French

2656
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:57,200
class and then we'll do like a PE class and we're like literally I'll just instruct you on what we're

2657
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:05,200
supposed to do and you'll just hear me jump up and down in my room um um what other we'll do mass

2658
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:13,120
as well I'll teach board mass is how we do it in the UK or maybe maybe just Scotland I don't know

2659
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:19,040
uh board masses brackets of division multiplication addition subtraction is different what the heck

2660
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:24,240
am I supposed to do I wasn't paying attention I think I'm supposed to collect things in this area

2661
02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:29,120
yes I am I am to collect things in this area if that's the case in viz right now

2662
02:59:30,640 --> 02:59:35,520
right we'll just do the outskirts of the area because I think that kind of highlights what the

2663
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:47,280
daily was where the heck over oh there is right there's one I can hear lots of enemies but I'm

2664
02:59:47,280 --> 02:59:55,600
trying not to engage in any of them I am gonna get him to not attack me by doing this nope that

2665
02:59:55,600 --> 03:00:02,480
was not that wasn't it oopsies literally just aggro time on me for no reason oh there is we need one

2666
03:00:02,480 --> 03:00:17,040
more pink tentacle oh there is there is right we're safe safe safe safe safe we're gonna try and

2667
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:21,760
avoid all the fights because you really do once you do like if you engage in all the fights you

2668
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:27,360
really do get like tangled up and all this time strongy teaching man and it's not gonna go well

2669
03:00:27,360 --> 03:00:31,840
but like we would do all the most basic covers like we do biology we'll do physics we'll do

2670
03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:37,280
chemistry and like a full day and the way I was gonna do it is we're not allowed to progress

2671
03:00:37,280 --> 03:00:42,400
until you guys actually give me the correct answer so depending on how fast you do it we'll get through

2672
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:47,120
the school day like really fast but like I'll put a little I don't know if I can get like a teacher

2673
03:00:48,160 --> 03:00:55,040
I don't know maybe put like a graduation cap oh wait hold on I just realized I'm not gonna light

2674
03:00:55,200 --> 03:01:00,340
on that's why my mouth tracking has been all funny hold on hold on professional streamer moment

2675
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:11,600
I'm gonna recalibrate just because I keep seeing my mouth is wiggling away I assure you I'm not

2676
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:15,600
about to cry you know when someone's about to cry then their mouth starts wiggling that's what I do

2677
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:23,500
anyway but we will recalibrate a little tricky a recalibration nope and my

2678
03:01:23,500 --> 03:01:28,280
blanket is currently trapped around the microphone that's not fair Mr. Blanket

2679
03:01:28,280 --> 03:01:34,600
please please work with me here your math phobia I hope you have a math

2680
03:01:34,600 --> 03:01:41,040
phobia numbers oh so I was calibrating so I had to go in the dead silence

2681
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:47,600
what you scared the numbers oh multiplication oh yeah that terrify

2682
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:55,080
you that stuff made out of nightmares for you yeah where's these horses

2683
03:01:59,440 --> 03:02:04,040
you could give a history lesson on the battle of bannock born I absolutely will

2684
03:02:04,040 --> 03:02:11,160
we'll do we'll have a Scottish lessons stream a segment for it because if we're

2685
03:02:11,160 --> 03:02:16,200
gonna study English later at your name I'm gonna stay off the horse for this I

2686

2691
03:02:54,080 --> 03:02:57,280
knows you're coming oh my god a veiler group calibration with the math cuz

2692
03:02:57,280 --> 03:03:01,880
apparently all of you struggle with math literally I like playing in the

2693
03:03:01,880 --> 03:03:05,960
criminal games but you know I don't actually like doing the thinking part

2694
03:03:05,960 --> 03:03:20,880
when it comes to numbers so yeah this is the way to victory to victory to

2695
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:29,080
victory this is the way to victory and this is a way we'll go I'm actually so

2696
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:34,240
fast on this is this faster than the Thanator actually might be you know oh

2697
03:03:34,280 --> 03:03:38,760
there's so many samples around here I'm just gonna check oh I'm actually max on

much for my class yeah we stand beside you even she be was struggling with a

2700
03:03:50,040 --> 03:03:57,400
puzzle puzzle games are mmm I asked Emmy and AC see if they would maybe

2701
03:03:57,400 --> 03:04:03,760
collab on we were here that puzzle game and they had to swap the game they gave

2702
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:06,960
it a little shot like just as a five 15-minute practice and they were like

2703
03:04:06,960 --> 03:04:09,400
we're not playing that and I was that's fine that's fine you don't have to play

2704
03:04:09,400 --> 03:04:17,560
it's fine fine I wanted to see if I could do it with the refling but then I'd

2705
03:04:17,560 --> 03:04:24,280
have to like if I could do it yeah they wonder the rock killed me it's sort of

2706
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:29,440
flipping entire boulder on my skull are you joking how is that supposed to know

2707
03:04:29,440 --> 03:04:36,040
that was about time that's outrageous oh map design change what's in here

2708
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:42,920
enemies got a lot of oh can you guess really not see

2709
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:55,640
okay I give up I give up that's really annoying what's going on here I've done

2710
03:04:55,640 --> 03:04:59,480
protection I've got knocked back I hate when they knock you back because that's

2711
03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:05,160
when you can just absolutely eat all of the damage that they're laying out which

2712
03:05:05,160 --> 03:05:14,480
is not good yeah like I'm literally getting so injured this your spawn point

2713
03:05:14,480 --> 03:05:19,440
is it behind here you suck give me that spawn point get that spawn point out

2714
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:25,200
here oh we're just like literally going back

2715
03:05:28,720 --> 03:05:34,880
could you do a lesson on Mary Kunis cause honestly oh my god I have to make you

2716
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:41,000
do force the force Pete are you religious education as well actually

2717
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:46,800
maybe not I may not be that fun for people I'll make us sing a song though

2718
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:59,440
a little don't carry anything down the dusty road something like that force choir

2719
03:05:59,440 --> 03:06:03,480
I'll have to get us all to sing at the same time but it has to be it has to be

2720
03:06:03,480 --> 03:06:09,360
like internet culture songs because why are we why did why did he just oh there's

2721
03:06:09,360 --> 03:06:16,160
a dog there but a dog dog with a book and I don't know what songs I could make

2722
03:06:16,320 --> 03:06:23,040
sing it would have to be related to meme culture what did you guys think about all

2723
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:33,200
the songs that made the girls sing I freaking how am I supposed to avoid that

2724
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:37,280
I'm sorry there's absolutely no way you can dodge that unless you went to attack

2725
03:06:37,360 --> 03:06:40,000
but if you am I am I going the wrong way

2726
03:06:44,400 --> 03:06:49,520
I've gone horrifically the wrong way sorry I had to like really think there I think I'm

2727
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:56,800
actually about to lose my dire horse coming back here because of this car yeah wow literally

2728
03:06:57,680 --> 03:07:03,360
Brian what if the game show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a

2729
03:07:03,360 --> 03:07:10,480
different subject eyes hold on I'm getting absolutely right hold on protection in viz

2730
03:07:10,480 --> 03:07:16,640
let's go oh and viz sorry right hold on narrow thank you for the tip hey shroney what if

2731
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:21,120
veal or game show with the girls where every stream the questions are about a different

2732
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:27,200
I'm sorry I can't do two things at once hold on hold on what way did I go stick to this one

2733
03:07:28,160 --> 03:07:33,680
oh oh oh I'm no I'm no I'm no smart enough to do two things at once I'm gonna have to read

2734
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:40,160
that all over again one more time take it from the top hey strong why is there more enemies

2735
03:07:40,160 --> 03:07:44,000
what if veal or game show with the girls where they stream the question there are different

2736
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:49,840
there the great questions are every so we do have one game show coming up that I'm gonna make

2737
03:07:49,840 --> 03:08:00,160
I am going to reach out to a creator for possibly they already do a game show but I was gonna set

2738
03:08:00,160 --> 03:08:06,400
it up for them so literally they can just rack in all the money if you didn't know the easiest way

2739
03:08:06,400 --> 03:08:12,240
to collab with people is to do all the work but let them like take over type thing it's the most

2740
03:08:13,360 --> 03:08:19,520
likely way that a collab opportunities will be accepted so I've got possibly a game show

2741
03:08:19,760 --> 03:08:25,760
we're going to show up on someone else's channel and and then I'll get like a highlight reel made

2742
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:32,640
and so I need to reach out to another creator but I'm letting this first week settle down like

2743
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:36,960
it's been a bit hectic like trying to get a script manager in place and we're trying to

2744
03:08:36,960 --> 03:08:43,120
deal with this clipping issue that we've kind of right now things are a bit slow to be produced

2745
03:08:43,120 --> 03:08:47,840
but the girls are going to have shorts that come out consistently on their channels at some point

2746
03:08:50,400 --> 03:08:58,480
but like me and she be are literally lagging for shorts because I'm waiting to get us monetized

2747
03:08:58,480 --> 03:09:04,400
first before we start putting shorts out because this is just a fact but shorts do better if

2748
03:09:04,400 --> 03:09:12,480
there's something in them that's a bit humorous in that way and the one that I got a she be to do

2749
03:09:12,480 --> 03:09:18,560
that a fauna speedrun challenge like that did well and all and I actually really she got to show

2750
03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:28,400
off her mine like voice which is absolutely perfect but the other ones I actually got her to discuss

2751
03:09:31,600 --> 03:09:38,880
milk body type v-tubers which I thought was super interesting but I'm too scared to put it up

2752
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:45,920
right now because I would be mortified if the girls didn't get accepted for monetization

2753
03:09:46,880 --> 03:09:54,640
and this recent ASMR stuff geez I'm literally getting grenade launched my goodness draw destroy

2754
03:09:54,640 --> 03:10:02,080
the amp soup well okay I'm gonna say where is it um but there will be a lot of shorts coming up

2755
03:10:02,080 --> 03:10:11,280
like one monetization is freaking dealt with uh because the stats updated but it only updated

2756
03:10:11,360 --> 03:10:17,760
halfway through debut so it says I still haven't reached watch hours even though I think I have

2757
03:10:17,760 --> 03:10:24,320
like a stupendous amount of watch hours now especially after that assassins creed my assassins

2758
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:31,200
creed brother you'd stream almost has more views than my debut stream which is hilarious to think

2759
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:35,600
about because I streamed for so long and I guess people just didn't expect it so like they came

2760
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:43,520
back in the stream twice at some point you made 20 hours in two days literally like but after

2761
03:10:43,520 --> 03:10:48,480
debut we all successfully had enough watch time at that point it's just youtube has taken an entire

2762
03:10:48,480 --> 03:10:54,160
week to update and today I was supposed to be able to apply everyone's channel for monetization

2763
03:10:54,160 --> 03:11:04,560
but it only partially updated the thing I think it's faster if I jump no just jump down on this

2764
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:11,040
bridge that comes up um but I only did it halfway through debut so I need to wait another 24 hours

2765
03:11:11,040 --> 03:11:18,880
for it to update and then I can submit all the girls channels um like I've got an ASMR short

2766
03:11:18,880 --> 03:11:28,000
of sheebie as well but Azura's short got denied for monetization for advertisement and I think it's

2767
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:34,720
literally because her voice is just too strong like I don't know how but her her voice is too

2768
03:11:34,720 --> 03:11:39,920
strong it needs nerve oh I really don't want to go down if that's there can I destroy this

2769
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:46,080
hold on did I just snipe him out of that car

2770
03:11:49,360 --> 03:11:55,520
did that car just disappear I'm just gonna invis through this section but that looks like

2771
03:11:55,520 --> 03:12:04,240
I sniked him out that car no I clearly didn't because he's right there you don't hear anything

2772
03:12:04,240 --> 03:12:10,400
that's called the AI cheating what's this a bomb ooh a bomb

2773
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:19,680
ooh a bomb whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa there's far too many of you right now there's far too many

2774
03:12:19,760 --> 03:12:26,080
of you right now oh my gosh oh my gosh I've done it now I've done it now I've done it now I've done

2775
03:12:26,080 --> 03:12:33,200
now commit commit commit commit submit conceptguitar where's the one where's the one just one more in

2776
03:12:33,200 --> 03:12:38,400
here there is a siya siya siya siya we can do this we can do this as long as I do I do it

2777
03:12:38,400 --> 03:12:43,840
I'll hit checkpoint right get me that head out here ooh I don't have heal yet I don't have

2778
03:12:43,840 --> 03:12:51,720
I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal, I have heal.

2779
03:12:51,720 --> 03:12:52,720
What's going on?

2780
03:12:52,720 --> 03:12:53,720
Why?

2781
03:12:53,720 --> 03:12:58,320
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, get on the horse, get on the horse, get on the horse,

2782
03:12:58,320 --> 03:12:59,320
get on the horse.

2783
03:12:59,320 --> 03:13:02,320
Am I on the wrong side?

2784
03:13:02,320 --> 03:13:07,320
If I go this way, I can teleport to that other one and then go from there.

2785
03:13:07,320 --> 03:13:08,800
Yes, we will do that.

2786
03:13:08,800 --> 03:13:10,800
Oh no, there's another one of these.

2787
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:13,320
Oh my gosh, they're so pee.

2788
03:13:13,320 --> 03:13:17,160
Goodness gravy.

2789
03:13:17,160 --> 03:13:19,280
What does that even mean?

2790
03:13:19,280 --> 03:13:26,720
How, literally, I think it's because very sadly sheepsters in Azura might have a cover

2791
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:37,000
up for their, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, we're kind of,

2792
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:41,960
we're at the question mark stage of what's the problem, what's the issue, but we'll

2793
03:13:41,960 --> 03:13:43,360
get there, okay.

2794
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:46,480
Did I say thank you for the tip, Nero?

2795
03:13:46,480 --> 03:13:47,480
Sorry if I didn't.

2796
03:13:47,480 --> 03:13:54,640
But yes, there are game show type-esque things coming up, there's no horse games.

2797
03:13:54,640 --> 03:13:59,320
November is my Scottish game show, I don't know if one of the girls might be interested

2798
03:13:59,320 --> 03:14:11,160
in holding a type of VTuber collab game show, I'll need to see, mate, I was actually helping

2799
03:14:11,480 --> 03:14:12,480
you, do you mind?

2800
03:14:12,480 --> 03:14:15,480
Jeez, you're so rude and stinky.

2801
03:14:15,480 --> 03:14:21,720
Alright, I think I'm to go this way and then, I'm sorry, I'm getting really switched around

2802
03:14:21,720 --> 03:14:26,920
with this freaking map, but we'll just, we'll go for it, we'll send it.

2803
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:34,640
Ooh, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you, hehehe, not interested, no thank you.

2804
03:14:34,640 --> 03:14:40,680
Your horses butt is soaking up all those bullets like a cha- honestly, stagger an amount of

2805
03:14:40,680 --> 03:14:44,360
endurance on that thing.

2806
03:14:44,360 --> 03:14:51,640
The Easter wheels, oh, are they finally giving me a path with no enemies?

2807
03:14:51,640 --> 03:14:55,960
You know what, I'm not speaking ever again, that's a ridiculous timing, you've embarrassed

2808
03:14:55,960 --> 03:14:58,280
me.

2809
03:14:58,280 --> 03:15:02,240
I would, I think that's my only complaint about this game, it would be so nice if there

2810
03:15:02,240 --> 03:15:06,400
was areas that you could just enjoy for the beauty, which I know this sounds like such

2811
03:15:06,400 --> 03:15:10,920
a weird thing to say, but like, I really, I like admiring the game, okay?

2812
03:15:10,920 --> 03:15:16,280
I'm a little, a little map design admirer and like look at how much nature there is.

2813
03:15:16,280 --> 03:15:20,160
I'm pretty sure there's actually a steam game that came out and it's all about identifying

2814
03:15:20,160 --> 03:15:25,440
plants in nature and I'm like, honestly, I wish I was like more entertaining so I could

2815
03:15:25,440 --> 03:15:29,640
play it, but I'm not that entertaining, B or B, I gotta go somewhere, okay let me just

2816
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:35,960
pause the stream, we'll wait for you to come back, see you when you come back.

2817
03:15:36,960 --> 03:15:50,720
Oh, it's not Osha, is it Peeta, P-E-T-A, Peeta, that's that animal organisation, Peeta,

2818
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:55,640
Peeta, that's not working in my head, I don't think it's Peeta.

2819
03:15:55,640 --> 03:16:02,400
Oh, new armour, oh, check that out, oh I like that, hold on, let's do a little wardrobe

2820
03:16:02,400 --> 03:16:05,440
check, wardrobe check, oh wait, whoa.

2821
03:16:05,440 --> 03:16:11,000
My mobility is way down, but my protection is so up from that, we might leave that up,

2822
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:19,800
I'd rather like have more indefinite protection than having to deal with all these issues,

2823
03:16:19,800 --> 03:16:21,960
with constantly like getting barraged.

2824
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:32,640
Ah, right, okay, crystal, crystal, crystal, crystal, let's beat them up, where's the crystal?

2825
03:16:33,360 --> 03:16:40,840
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, steady on, steady on, where's the crystal, I'm like literally

2826
03:16:40,840 --> 03:16:49,600
jump-scaring these guys, whoa, you were on the crystal, alright, where is it, am I staring

2827
03:16:49,600 --> 03:16:55,640
at it, oh it's up, oh wow, okay, I wouldn't have known that, it's like I was on that

2828
03:16:55,640 --> 03:17:05,680
crystal there, mission complete, wee, ow, my ankles, no again, protection is more important,

2829
03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:15,960
the mobility, I would say so yeah, that's a big old horse ride, um, can I, wait is that,

2830
03:17:15,960 --> 03:17:22,240
that is done, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, just reading them up, yeah, I don't know where

2831
03:17:22,320 --> 03:17:26,240
to go, I don't know where to go, I don't know, really turned around, I think it would be

2832
03:17:26,240 --> 03:17:40,160
faster if I took a teleport near this location, um, hello, uh, I have to redo the set, alright,

2833
03:17:40,160 --> 03:17:48,760
okay, no, I just fell through the map, okay, classic open, but there we go, I think we're

2834
03:17:48,800 --> 03:17:54,040
actually getting pretty close, I have never done that before, I guess this game, I mean

2835
03:17:54,040 --> 03:18:00,920
I did say that games have problems with vertical stuff, especially older games, when it comes

2836
03:18:00,920 --> 03:18:07,360
to mapping you just fall through the map so many times in older games, right, we're gonna

2837
03:18:07,360 --> 03:18:17,360
teleport where, it looks like that and then just take a weird straight ahead, what a strange

2838
03:18:17,480 --> 03:18:27,280
layout for a map, a skill issue honestly, childhood me would never do that, and yet here we are

2839
03:18:27,280 --> 03:18:37,000
being an even worse gamer, pardon me, I'm doing this with baby birds this time, I saw the

2840
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:46,600
truck, I saw it, wait I need to claim this, I don't know, oh my, I don't know if I'm,

2841
03:18:46,720 --> 03:18:51,640
can I get away with this, oh my god I can get away with it, oh, oh that poor horse I've

2842
03:18:51,640 --> 03:18:56,040
just left it, I'm so sorry you get to meet Ewa now, hush hush, your plight is over, you

2843
03:18:56,040 --> 03:19:03,200
no longer have to, you can frolic in the fields in Ewa's heaven now, if I've just left you,

2844
03:19:03,200 --> 03:19:13,440
to perish to the RDA, ooh, I would make the joke but I don't have any more sound effects,

2845
03:19:13,480 --> 03:19:18,600
magic your way to the other side of the map honestly, a bit cheeky to claim when there's an

2846
03:19:18,600 --> 03:19:24,880
entire tank shooting at you, you're the best gamer I am especially when you rage, oh no, I

2847
03:19:24,880 --> 03:19:30,720
always feel bad when I rage because I feel like it's like, I like doing what I like to see and if

2848
03:19:30,720 --> 03:19:35,840
I see like a streamer rage I'm like, I'm not sure I'm finding this entertaining but if you guys

2849
03:19:35,840 --> 03:19:43,320
like it then sure I'll tap into my ancestors rage, I'm literally the, is it the orcs and

2850
03:19:43,400 --> 03:19:51,400
Skyrim, I think their special move is called Ancestral's Rage and it's like 10% more, or

2851
03:19:51,400 --> 03:19:58,240
Berserk type thing, it's like 10% more damage, what's going on here, the last song, right,

2852
03:19:58,240 --> 03:20:04,120
look for the thumping when bumping, nope, there's a fight, why is there a fight, I thought I just

2853
03:20:04,120 --> 03:20:11,640
had to interact with the tree, did I not have to interact with the tree, oh, okay, okay, okay,

2854
03:20:11,800 --> 03:20:15,000
we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it, come on, let's do it before

2855
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:21,160
they destroy absolutely everything, is it not here, triangle, hello triangle, looking for a

2856
03:20:21,160 --> 03:20:27,960
triangle, triangle, this is a triangle, there we go, are they going to blow the tree up before

2857
03:20:27,960 --> 03:20:34,200
I get the phone, no the Ancestral stuff was done more, Berserkers rage is the one that works out,

2858
03:20:34,520 --> 03:20:41,800
ah, right, invisible because we're not out here trying to have a billion battles every two seconds,

2859
03:20:43,160 --> 03:20:47,640
yeah, probably feedback on the game, kind of calm down on how many enemies you put on the map

2860
03:20:47,640 --> 03:20:54,680
because they are constant, hello barrier, did this, did this game really say go around,

2861
03:20:56,200 --> 03:21:02,600
no way this game just said go around, oh no it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine,

2862
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:10,440
yes, yes, let's get out of here, this place is gonna blow, oh, we must return to Kellotron,

2863
03:21:10,440 --> 03:21:17,160
take your ecran, we ride to home tree, okay, we go to home tree, home tree,

2864
03:21:23,400 --> 03:21:27,400
I think we're getting there, I can't really recall how much more to the campaign there is,

2865
03:21:27,800 --> 03:21:33,480
this would be three songs and if we're playing the classic video game rule,

2866
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:43,800
I can't remember what comes after the third song, I swear if it's like go for another song on my

2867
03:21:43,800 --> 03:21:50,120
right, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up, you're taking a bit too long now, take a bit too long,

2868
03:21:50,120 --> 03:21:53,720
we're gonna need to do something a bit more than home questing, but look how cool that armor looks

2869
03:21:53,720 --> 03:21:59,800
honestly, that's pretty thick, it would be so cool to see this game remastered,

2870
03:21:59,800 --> 03:22:06,440
but I do not think it sold well, I think it hardly did it, it's numeros, hello,

2871
03:22:09,320 --> 03:22:17,080
we love them, James Cameron you did it again, is it snowing, no,

2872
03:22:17,080 --> 03:22:20,360
let's hope we're getting close, we don't find it soon, this whole planet's gonna

2873
03:22:20,360 --> 03:22:27,480
fly, winter in Australia is just fake, it never goes below freezing,

2874
03:22:30,440 --> 03:22:34,040
yes yes the song, the song, ay was song, please be the last song, no more singing,

2875
03:22:34,280 --> 03:22:38,520

many of the people believe in you yet some fear the tattooed spirit inside you let me get

2878
03:22:54,680 --> 03:22:59,800
fedama he blames you for much there was just a whole missing voice line i think

2879
03:23:01,560 --> 03:23:10,200
it was so hard to come to our realization that christmas is summer final song it's not natural

but it's a pretty decided once i wrap up a business that i am going back to

2882
03:23:27,880 --> 03:23:30,280

03:23:50,920 --> 03:23:54,520
i'm afraid my memory is getting very easy now for the game

2887
03:23:54,920 --> 03:24:03,560
you'd kill for a warm christmas it is bizarre i did not enjoy it like i phoned my family

2888
03:24:04,520 --> 03:24:14,440
and i was like oh i wish it was cold i wish it was cold um because you do get snowy christmas

2889
03:24:14,440 --> 03:24:19,320
in scotland which is really pretty when it does happen when the stars align it's very nice

2890
03:24:20,120 --> 03:24:25,800
hello hello i haven't given up where is the shot

2891
03:24:27,560 --> 03:24:33,560
where sky machine has crushed you are so mean i've literally been helping you for ages

2892
03:24:34,280 --> 03:24:37,800
i'm sorry but i think enough time to pass where he should be all right with me

2893
03:24:37,800 --> 03:24:44,920
and you're giving me any nonsense you make it sound so mystical it's very beautiful

2894
03:24:44,920 --> 03:24:49,080
where the what the heck is this map i do not recall at all

2895
03:24:51,320 --> 03:24:55,960
memories getting a little bit easy i can't see where the map ends because of that very

2896
03:24:55,960 --> 03:25:02,920
top right corner very clearly that's where this map location ends but i don't know what happens here

2897
03:25:05,080 --> 03:25:11,320
i can't believe it right i think we're just gonna leg it as we always do

2898
03:25:11,320 --> 03:25:18,360
but yeah like these look the map details like the kind of the further you progress the more

2899
03:25:18,360 --> 03:25:26,040
damage the areas are and you know it was trying our hardest but like there's only only so much

2900
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:32,440
awa can do and the navi can do against literal bullets i have to admit bows versus bullets

2901
03:25:32,440 --> 03:25:37,640
like i'd rather have the rather have the mp5 or the famine so my wait why did i get off i just

2902
03:25:37,720 --> 03:25:42,200
want to activate that oh well i needed to get off anyway because i need to cut up in this fence

2903
03:25:42,200 --> 03:25:47,960
i'm itching my little whoa is this elden ring oh you've got this right let's see

2904
03:25:50,600 --> 03:25:57,160
uh we'll just avoid thank you for spawning in but not really interested me wait am i going

2905
03:25:57,160 --> 03:26:04,360
the wrong way no i can go this way i just happened to walk right into an rda uh aligned and i need

2906
03:26:04,360 --> 03:26:10,600
to cut this fence as well goodness gravy i might make a cup of tea shortly and go for a peep because

2907
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:17,400
we've actually not peeped in three and a half hours of uh unless some of you guys have a detached

2908
03:26:17,400 --> 03:26:25,800
headset and then you go for a peep whilst whilst still listening to oh the fact that there's a

2909
03:26:25,800 --> 03:26:31,880
very high chance that a reefling has dropped a loaf of bread while listening to me ramble on stream

2910
03:26:31,880 --> 03:26:38,200
that's right reefling i'm on air i know exactly what you're up to mm-hmm i know what's going on

2911
03:26:41,480 --> 03:26:48,760
a drop a loaf of bread honestly drop apparently the there's another same which is a drop the

2912
03:26:48,760 --> 03:26:58,680
kids off at the pool which is a guilty is charged oh no it's been confirmed you know when people

2913
03:26:58,760 --> 03:27:02,360
say like oh what did you what what did you think would happen like when you became a

2914
03:27:02,360 --> 03:27:08,440
vertebra etc uh apparently i didn't account for someone dropping a loaf of bread to my voice so

2915
03:27:08,440 --> 03:27:15,480
there's that yeah um yeah quite a few unique scenarios definitely definitely

2916
03:27:19,240 --> 03:27:24,280
how are you ever like he teleports around this map for fun i swear okay hello

2917
03:27:24,520 --> 03:27:34,040
no the shard was blown up not sure not sure the first voice is not sure oh i'm being called

2918
03:27:34,040 --> 03:27:37,400
the first voice i'm no longer dreamwalker oh my tummy rumbled if you heard that

2919
03:27:38,680 --> 03:27:43,000
listen into your patreon audio we'll see in a man about horse

2920
03:27:46,200 --> 03:27:50,680
i didn't want to miss the second of your beautiful voice though if it's any consolation

2921
03:27:51,320 --> 03:27:57,160
you make dropping and you make dropping a loaf of bread hell a lot more comfortable you're done

2922
03:27:57,160 --> 03:27:59,480
you're out out you're done

2923
03:28:02,200 --> 03:28:09,480
we would be not identifying as loaf of bread droppers oh that came out nowhere

2924
03:28:10,200 --> 03:28:16,520
oh my poor horse i should have picked up a new one

2925
03:28:17,960 --> 03:28:22,120
because he's so low health i want him to retire and live a happy life

2926
03:28:22,120 --> 03:28:25,240
but i don't think that's gonna is a left or right it's this way

2927
03:28:33,800 --> 03:28:35,960
she knows too much hey yeah

2928
03:28:36,360 --> 03:28:43,720
oh right i'm gonna pick up this horse here because i would like this one to literally

2929
03:28:43,720 --> 03:28:49,400
retire and have a happy life excuse me mr. horsey see you go enjoy yourself and heal up and then

2930
03:28:49,400 --> 03:28:50,840
i'm gonna have you

2931
03:28:53,720 --> 03:28:58,760
and then everyone lived happily ever after and the and everyone around me clapped yay

2932
03:28:59,160 --> 03:29:04,520
hey that's what we're supposed to listen to the first honestly though

2933
03:29:06,200 --> 03:29:14,280
um wow that's a lot of power about a lot of manpower behind that

2934
03:29:15,560 --> 03:29:19,640
they're destroying the crystals before we get them is someone telling them this

2935
03:29:22,840 --> 03:29:24,680
how do they know where the heck all these crystals are

2936
03:29:25,640 --> 03:29:32,280
right we'll finish this map and then we'll go for a tinkle and i will also go for a

2937
03:29:32,280 --> 03:29:37,720
tinkle and make a cup of honey tea to help soothe my curve voice it's really bizarre

2938
03:29:38,440 --> 03:29:45,320
my voice is so broken but the microphone makes it sound so like fine and not broke wait can i

2939
03:29:45,320 --> 03:29:57,240
just teleport no um so i sound like pretty normal on stream my voice has been broken since uh the

2940
03:29:58,360 --> 03:30:05,720
the violor exposed violor stream um i don't know thankfully i've managed to record a lot of

2941
03:30:05,720 --> 03:30:13,000
stuff in advance but don't be surprised if you get a patreon audio and i'm just sound like a frog

2942
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:19,080
i'm like yeah you like that good boy and you're such a good wee boy and you like my toad boy like

2943
03:30:19,080 --> 03:30:27,640
it's getting it's getting curious it's getting curious and you are a demon how is it you live

2944
03:30:29,320 --> 03:30:35,240
honestly that's kind of a fair assumption there's something i gotta tell you we must have been

2945
03:30:35,480 --> 03:30:45,560
those who have fallen do some patreon videos in full pantomime you get 3d models and start like

2946
03:30:45,560 --> 03:30:55,080
mime in the axe yeah wouldn't be the first thing patreon looks and audio in me a little frog voice

2947
03:30:55,080 --> 03:31:01,480
moment you let a horse die oh it was a mistake i can't save them all but i can try my best

2948
03:31:02,280 --> 03:31:08,440
also i just want to say i am still getting marshmallows of people asking me to save

2949
03:31:08,440 --> 03:31:13,960
each oh that horse literally just perished right before me oh where am i supposed to go

2950
03:31:13,960 --> 03:31:17,800
uh that's quite far to go by foot but we don't really have a choice there's no more horsey

2951
03:31:17,800 --> 03:31:29,240
boysy um skull horse skull women sound really cute when their voice is cracked and squeak

2952
03:31:29,320 --> 03:31:36,200
from over use and they're giggling asking you to say what no they're they're asking me to save

2953
03:31:37,080 --> 03:31:43,640
certain v-tubers and i said it on that stream the other day and like we're all having a giggle

2954
03:31:43,640 --> 03:31:49,160
but i woke up and i got a few more and i'm like i don't i don't know if it's reef link sending it

2955
03:31:49,160 --> 03:31:56,120
or whatever but like i'm gonna be on it oh it's full health again um i'm gonna be honest uh i hope

2956
03:31:56,120 --> 03:32:01,320
it's understandable no i can't literally save all v-tubers you know i'll try my best to look

2957
03:32:01,320 --> 03:32:08,120
after those who have faith in me um you know i'm a big believer in reciprocation in terms of you

2958
03:32:08,120 --> 03:32:18,440
have faith in me i have faith in you type thing oh well i better not am i on a timer and i don't

2959
03:32:18,440 --> 03:32:32,040
know it i think i'm on a timer gotta go gotta go gotta go i know i know i know i know i'm trying

2960
03:32:34,440 --> 03:32:41,640
i can unlock this uh tree of vision you can leave from the front and try and change i think

2961
03:32:42,200 --> 03:32:52,680
the content creator owned agencies definitely have a place um definitely have a place um

2962
03:32:53,560 --> 03:33:00,360
because i think people are a bit it's not for me to say what the the overall feel is but i think

2963
03:33:01,720 --> 03:33:07,560
for me anyway it was very disappointing to learn how little creators that sign up for

2964
03:33:07,560 --> 03:33:13,640
these agencies get in exchange for all their hard work because did he just go ahead me powerful

2965
03:33:13,640 --> 03:33:20,440
then a river did he just go ahead me um hello hello human resources do you guys have human

2966
03:33:20,440 --> 03:33:29,960
resources on pandora because um what was that excuse me uh yeah because we have very specific

2967
03:33:30,040 --> 03:33:37,560
unlikely but um i did actually learn about another agency that did have a higher split

2968
03:33:37,560 --> 03:33:44,200
than the 5050 which i'm i'm quite happy to hear about um so i think hopefully over time that 5050

2969
03:33:44,200 --> 03:33:50,200
split uh gets raised because i will tell you right now for however hard the girls work on

2970
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:55,000
stream it's absolutely nothing to do with me i don't tell them what to do they do it all themselves

2971
03:33:55,000 --> 03:34:02,760
um and i believe that they should take home the lion's share that's just me but not every

2972
03:34:03,320 --> 03:34:10,840
agency out there feels like that um but if you value um if you genuinely like as a special thank

2973
03:34:10,840 --> 03:34:15,240
you is what wait hold on i'm getting absolutely annihilated here do i need to take these down i

2974
03:34:15,240 --> 03:34:26,440
think so hold on i'm doing i cast protection what's going on here am i just to destroy

2975
03:34:27,320 --> 03:34:34,440
because i'll do it ow we're on the same team right i don't have protection anymore but

2976
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:42,200
uh okay okay we're to just kill i can do that i can do that we but i'm a weapon

2977
03:34:43,640 --> 03:34:47,800
what's this is this and can i not know uh

2978
03:34:49,560 --> 03:34:54,920
whoa whoa whoa you're not agro to me hey hey yay yay yay yay we're helping a while we're

2979
03:34:54,920 --> 03:35:00,040
helping helping you know what helping is yeah these guys these are the best

2980
03:35:00,280 --> 03:35:07,800
are they spawning oh my game just froze there did you see that i don't know if that was calling

2981
03:35:07,800 --> 03:35:12,920
stream or not but that was for me and i thought i can hear bullets from over here so we check out

2982
03:35:14,360 --> 03:35:23,640
okay let's go oh one more one more mission oh here here spawned a navi resources

2983
03:35:30,040 --> 03:35:32,040
the world would be a beautiful place if you're more like me

2984
03:35:33,720 --> 03:35:35,400
the only the only problem is uh

2985
03:35:37,880 --> 03:35:41,720
you never know if someone wants to take like advantage of you but i i got very lucky in

2986
03:35:41,720 --> 03:35:45,560
all my pics of the girls and none of them have given any indication such things

2987
03:35:46,360 --> 03:35:52,760
we got the crimson yeah froze i saw that monk is monk is monk is please don't please don't crash

2990
03:36:04,040 --> 03:36:10,920
used to it and i i do have to agree i do have to agree um but the the good news is it can

2991
03:36:10,920 --> 03:36:17,480
lead to such such crazy experiences you know like i could have easily like have just never

2992
03:36:17,480 --> 03:36:25,240
bothered about any of it and just you know get the resources to myself all that kind of thing but um

3011
03:38:37,080 --> 03:38:45,480
little excited there uh got a little uh head of myself that was a cheeky little camera angle moment

3012
03:38:45,880 --> 03:38:53,000

3015
03:39:05,480 --> 03:39:11,000

3016
03:39:11,400 --> 03:39:15,080
are you telling me the navi gets steaming every weekend i'd believe it honestly

3017
03:39:18,200 --> 03:39:22,040
i'd get a steaming with the navi not gonna lie i'd like ask them to carry me around on their backs

3018
03:39:22,040 --> 03:39:31,480
and stuff he was we discord kitten honestly he's not a hater anymore literally he was just a bit

03:39:31,480 --> 03:39:36,680
stressed from all the war just a wee bit of war wee bit of war you know strong men more times you

3020
03:39:36,680 --> 03:39:40,280

3021
03:39:40,280 --> 03:39:47,800
happens just what happens oh my god do you approve of me now you think the first thing the humans

3027
03:40:30,200 --> 03:40:37,240
literally eight hours to understand now quickly um sing the final song oh but that's like such a

3028
03:40:37,240 --> 03:40:46,440
short screen though i never thought this far ahead i thought it was gonna be like an eight hour day

3029
03:40:48,280 --> 03:40:52,680
i suppose the only good side if it was a short stream i can work on my asmr then

3030
03:40:52,680 --> 03:40:57,160

03:41:56,520 --> 03:42:01,480
any percent speed run honestly i feel like we're about to play the last game

3039
03:42:02,520 --> 03:42:11,640

3172
03:58:03,880 --> 03:58:11,960
humans punching me honestly if you if you try and dissect the gameplay a little too much you

3173
03:58:11,960 --> 03:58:17,000
might find yourself a little a little underwhelmed it may be a little lackluster but uh this one

3174
03:58:17,640 --> 03:58:21,720
oh don't wait wait wait then you worry about it right then you worry about it you're all destroyed

3175
03:58:21,720 --> 03:58:27,800
Savoy and his demons oh demon skin i like the description for America i'm currently in my demon

3176

3179
03:58:55,560 --> 03:59:02,920
i have a skull on my head oh hey i almost forgot this game because congrats you're the second person

3180
03:59:02,920 --> 03:59:09,800
to play this game uh that even knows about this game because one person said they played it earlier

3181
03:59:09,800 --> 03:59:14,760
and then now you've said you played it so now all three of us who have ever played this game are now

3182
03:59:14,760 --> 03:59:19,480
here because literally no one has played this game does anyone i wonder if there's a public

3183
03:59:19,480 --> 03:59:25,000
record of how many copies were sold because i just feel like it's such a thing way too late for this

3184
03:59:25,000 --> 03:59:31,960
stream but i'm also one of the two people i played yeah uh everyone thinks i'm playing the new avatar

3185
03:59:31,960 --> 03:59:36,280
i think possibly i don't know actually i don't know what the new avatar games called because this

3186
03:59:36,280 --> 03:59:41,800
one's called james cameron's avatar the game well we've got to say oh my god mansion armor to winzies

3187
03:59:42,360 --> 03:59:50,200
go waits for me in the in the cavern okay to the cat to the cavern to the cavern or something's

3188
03:59:50,200 --> 03:59:57,800
waiting for me waiting waiting waiting cavern right i'm about to go around okay i'm to go around my

3189
03:59:57,800 --> 04:00:08,840
apologies this the game has an interest in story i like it basically you are human and then it turns

3190
04:00:08,840 --> 04:00:17,640
out a war planned on you kind of i don't know it's really bizarre oh a scalp the perimeter comb that

3191
04:00:17,640 --> 04:00:25,400
beach why is that phrase called comb a beach what's that you mean what does it mean what does it even

3192
04:00:25,400 --> 04:00:31,720
translate to am i going the wrong way i'm getting nervous i'm going to they can literally hear me

3193
04:00:31,720 --> 04:00:40,040
like jump a boot i hear them oh my going to make it is in this oh i almost made it past all those

3194
04:00:40,040 --> 04:00:47,720
rda soldiers i'll take it i'll take it a couple paths yeah i assume when we play the rda side

3195
04:00:47,720 --> 04:00:54,040
we're literally just playing the exact same maps but doing the opposite of the bad people

3196
04:00:55,000 --> 04:01:01,400
and destroying everything wow i need prediction on right now i'm getting

3197
04:01:01,960 --> 04:01:08,360
absolutely nailed them right now i don't want to use healing because i actually do a full health bar

3198
04:01:08,360 --> 04:01:16,200
when i heal let's uh let's speed on speed on through okay this looks more navvy oriented

3199
04:01:17,080 --> 04:01:22,520
four hours is it going to be another endurance stream i think so originally it wasn't but um

3200
04:01:22,520 --> 04:01:28,520
um i got paid money to play the rda side and you guys are holding my hand through it because

3201
04:01:28,520 --> 04:01:36,200
i am genuinely afraid of what happens hello how do you do i'll hope lies with you dreamwalkers excuse

3202
04:01:36,200 --> 04:01:40,440
me i'm actually called the first voice i'm no longer i didn't i don't respond to dreamwalker i'm the

3203
04:01:40,440 --> 04:01:50,840
first boy will not let them any first voicers has asked you to kill rda forces yeah so emmy is going

3204
04:01:50,840 --> 04:02:02,040

3205
04:02:02,040 --> 04:02:11,240
okay smart and mckels smart smart embers uh this looks like it's uh destroy everything mission

3206
04:02:11,240 --> 04:02:16,760
because there's a timer oh right there is actually a timer on the day i don't know if any protection

3207
04:02:16,760 --> 04:02:22,520
spell yet i'll wait until i'm getting whacked i don't i'm not experiencing the whacking yet

3208
04:02:25,240 --> 04:02:32,440
uh i'm gone right okay i think the game's actually getting mildly oh my god imagine

3209
04:02:32,440 --> 04:02:38,920
three navvy ganging up on you it's over it's over i wouldn't even bother just put the gun down and be

3212
04:02:49,640 --> 04:02:56,840
ganging up in the fur guy oh that's terrible absolutely a wipe in the night i guess

3213
04:02:59,560 --> 04:03:07,000
one for you one spank for you and one for you okay we just need to defend the village now

3214
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:14,440
without perishing which i can definitely i can hear someone getting hurt over here oh yeah

3215
04:03:16,520 --> 04:03:19,720
one for the true warfare i think we're cheering each other on

3216
04:03:21,080 --> 04:03:29,480
we responsible i was just okay i'm gonna need that prayer to pop again because now there's mecha

3217
04:03:29,480 --> 04:03:34,040

04:04:03,800 --> 04:04:08,680
imagine assassin's speed but planer's attempt yeah that's what i'm kind of like why on earth

3222
04:04:09,320 --> 04:04:17,560
would anyone want to do the rda but like money talks dirty cash i want you dirty cash i want you

3223
04:04:17,560 --> 04:04:27,240
oh money talking money talking stupid oh um oh camera angle steady steady right we've got one more

3224
04:04:27,240 --> 04:04:39,560
minute isn't that a game already what game are you partly viewing about identify your topic of conversation

3225
04:04:39,800 --> 04:04:51,400
one two three four five ultimate yeah honestly that ultimate is actually pretty sad so i'm gonna

3226
04:04:51,400 --> 04:04:56,520
heal because it's not gonna all heal when we're not around it because the enemies keep coming back

3227
04:04:56,520 --> 04:05:08,200
so protection oh there's a mech over there i think oh it's out of bounds wow i just do this for now

3228
04:05:09,800 --> 04:05:17,240
oh no no i won't somebody's getting me oh maybe not maybe not the navi are actually helping hold on

3229
04:05:17,240 --> 04:05:22,520
ai that actually attacks the enemies that are around you hold on a minute this game's 2009 and

3230
04:05:22,520 --> 04:05:28,040
you're telling me they nailed it here and then games afterwards it's my biggest like great

3231
04:05:29,000 --> 04:05:35,000
with video game development if you have allies that can attack but they do not actually end the

3232
04:05:35,000 --> 04:05:43,720
enemies looking at you lego franchise looking at you and they actually don't help at all i don't

3233
04:05:43,720 --> 04:05:50,040
know if the newest lego star wars they actually do help her is she playing this because she genuinely

3234
04:05:50,040 --> 04:05:57,880
likes it or is she as a warning to the rest of us avoid this it's my childhood game i do like the

3235
04:05:57,880 --> 04:06:04,040

that's like such a cool looking dragon such a badass looking dragon

3238
04:06:22,680 --> 04:06:26,920

okay question mark question mark

3266
04:09:52,840 --> 04:09:58,520
we're saved though that's the fantastic news first voice does not need a second

3267
04:09:59,480 --> 04:10:01,480
he really

3268
04:10:08,040 --> 04:10:11,480
we prepare a storm is in the sky

3269
04:10:17,080 --> 04:10:24,680
we did it na vi na vi na vi we're the best we're the best better than the rest better than the rda

3270
04:10:25,480 --> 04:10:27,880
let me take a little little drink too

3271
04:10:31,080 --> 04:10:36,440
congrats on getting second please for na vi any percent lemo let me submit this stream for it why not

3272
04:10:41,160 --> 04:10:47,480
another game down well uh we're gonna go for a tinkle winkle and i'm gonna make a honey tea

3273
04:10:47,480 --> 04:10:57,160
because my voice box is dying and then we're gonna do the rda side so don't uh emmy i believe

3274
04:10:57,160 --> 04:11:04,280
sheebie is playing class of 09 emmy bezu is doing an unlisted unarchived stream so please don't be

3275
04:11:04,280 --> 04:11:08,280
afraid to go check that out because i'll still be here actually i don't know how long she's gonna go

3276
04:11:08,280 --> 04:11:13,480
for that maybe i mean if it's four hours to do the rda side it is very rough on the voice to whisper

3277
04:11:13,480 --> 04:11:22,520
for four hours so hopefully i know boo rda rda hate emmy is making pin pals do math oh no way

3278
04:11:23,640 --> 04:11:26,840
i think to know if you play as a human you have multiple places where you can betray them

3279
04:11:28,600 --> 04:11:32,840
hmm what is that like all the way up to the very end

3280
04:11:34,840 --> 04:11:39,320
because wouldn't i wouldn't i just become a na vi at that point or am i still human

3281
04:11:39,720 --> 04:11:46,280
you wouldn't i have to do the evil side now unfortunately

3282
04:11:48,600 --> 04:11:54,840
i think i would ruin the run if i did it i beat the game already literally i think it's

3283
04:11:54,840 --> 04:12:00,200
four hours for each side yeah there's emmy rda hate but gun and flamethrower fun though

3284
04:12:00,200 --> 04:12:03,160
then every straight up ask you to switch like three four times oh do they

3285
04:12:04,120 --> 04:12:06,280
i would know i love gun shoot so i

3286
04:12:12,600 --> 04:12:21,880
right i'm gonna quickly go peep um and make a cup of tea i highly suggest everyone to stretch

3287
04:12:21,880 --> 04:12:28,520
your legs don't be afraid to open up any stream the now um i will be roughly three minutes it takes

3288
04:12:28,600 --> 04:12:33,320
me like three minutes to boil the kettle and tinkle and all of that so please do do fish pee

3289

3293
04:13:01,720 --> 04:13:05,240
guys have to hold my hands with the game because i am actually genuinely terrified to please swim

3294
04:13:05,240 --> 04:13:09,080
in all the way through because camera angle is so freaking low to the ground and if i've got big

3295
04:13:09,080 --> 04:13:14,760
navi running at me i'm actually gonna be scared so yes hopefully this doesn't work i really hope

3296
04:13:14,760 --> 04:13:19,000
the game doesn't break well i'm gonna wait for like literally three minutes but the game's so old

I don't know what's going on here.

3308

3343

Oh, I'm having a stroke and not the good kind.

3344
04:26:01,000 --> 04:26:05,000
Oh.

3345
04:26:05,000 --> 04:26:09,000
Okay, to my next card.

3346
04:26:09,000 --> 04:26:15,000
What do you call a man? No.

3347
04:26:15,000 --> 04:26:18,000
It's so goofy.

3348
04:26:18,000 --> 04:26:23,000
It's so goofy.

3349
04:26:23,000 --> 04:26:27,000
Turning the stream into a dad pun stream, honestly.

3350
04:26:27,000 --> 04:26:29,000
I love this bit.

3351
04:26:29,000 --> 04:26:32,000
Well, when you guys do witty comments that I can repeat on stream,

3352
04:26:32,000 --> 04:26:37,000
I'm literally stealing them and then doing that gag over and over again.

3353
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:39,000
I should be straight up to working.

3354
04:26:39,000 --> 04:26:43,000
Okay, I have to go now. Bye-bye. Bye. Thank you for hanging.

3355
04:26:43,000 --> 04:26:45,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3356
04:26:45,000 --> 04:26:47,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3357
04:26:47,000 --> 04:26:49,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3358
04:26:49,000 --> 04:26:51,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3359
04:26:51,000 --> 04:26:53,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3360
04:26:53,000 --> 04:26:55,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3361
04:26:55,000 --> 04:26:57,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3362
04:26:57,000 --> 04:26:59,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3363
04:26:59,000 --> 04:27:01,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3364
04:27:01,000 --> 04:27:03,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3365
04:27:03,000 --> 04:27:05,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3366
04:27:05,000 --> 04:27:07,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3367
04:27:07,000 --> 04:27:09,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3368
04:27:09,000 --> 04:27:11,000
I don't know why, but the crickets make me laugh.

3369
04:27:16,000 --> 04:27:18,000
What do you get when you cross a snowman and a vampire?

3370
04:27:28,000 --> 04:27:30,000
Why was that so delayed?

3371
04:27:30,000 --> 04:27:32,000
I don't know why the crickets were so delayed.

3372
04:27:32,000 --> 04:27:34,500
That was even more embarrassing.

3373
04:27:34,500 --> 04:27:36,500
That made it worse that the crickets were delayed.

3374
04:27:39,000 --> 04:27:47,240
All right, you ready for this we're skipping we're skipping

3375
04:27:48,600 --> 04:27:51,480
Even the crickets aren't having it literally even showing up

3376
04:27:53,920 --> 04:27:55,920
Eight hours built on the shorter side

3377
04:27:57,800 --> 04:28:03,040
I'll let you like I've kind of mentioned I weave it, but like going offline after two hours

3378
04:28:03,040 --> 04:28:07,200
I like sat and was just staring at the screen for a little bit. I was like

3379
04:28:07,600 --> 04:28:14,120
What do I do now like I've got like an entire day, and I'm not on stream like it felt so weird

3380
04:28:14,920 --> 04:28:16,920
Like I don't

3381
04:28:17,520 --> 04:28:22,400
But I reached them a smart collapse type thing, which is really good

3382
04:28:27,200 --> 04:28:29,200
Our little cheekies are definitely red

3383
04:28:30,040 --> 04:28:31,520
reporting for duty, sir

3384
04:28:32,400 --> 04:28:37,960
I think I'm too German for the jokes are the bad they are terrible the jokes are not funny and

3385
04:28:38,360 --> 04:28:40,360
That is why we we use the

3386
04:28:42,720 --> 04:28:44,720
Cuz no one's laughing at the joke

3387
04:28:46,320 --> 04:28:48,320
Honestly it felt weird like

3388
04:28:49,160 --> 04:28:53,320
I'll every week I do plan in a couple of injured streams

3389
04:28:54,360 --> 04:29:00,080
But the days that have shorter streams like the two are one like I really enjoyed needy streamer overload

3390
04:29:00,080 --> 04:29:03,200
I did not expect to enjoy that. I looked up the

3391
04:29:04,160 --> 04:29:09,640
Ending I would have gotten if I managed to not ignore her and

3392
04:29:11,120 --> 04:29:18,320
Like she was like ready to become a god and like take down 10% of the world's population and all that and I'm like whoa

3393
04:29:19,520 --> 04:29:24,840
I so wish I could have gotten that but I messed up too badly, but that's okay. I couldn't have known you know

3394
04:29:25,320 --> 04:29:27,320
played for the same

3395
04:29:27,320 --> 04:29:32,280
You know you get none of the squat you go you and none of the squad laughing with that one I giggle

3396
04:29:33,320 --> 04:29:36,940
You're still sitting on your feet. I am I'm sitting on my right one right now

3397
04:29:36,940 --> 04:29:41,500
And then the left one is just wiggling the back of the chair. Why do you want to go?

3398
04:29:43,280 --> 04:29:45,280
Don't abuse

3399
04:29:45,320 --> 04:29:47,320
What do you say?

3400
04:29:48,760 --> 04:29:52,440
Niko from undead and what I don't know

3401
04:29:53,440 --> 04:29:59,740
Think of criss-cross applesauce the way you sit like that, but I'm sitting on my foot like against my

3402
04:30:02,960 --> 04:30:09,340
Honestly good way to really enjoy streams of you because I constantly like wiggle and move my legs type thing

3403
04:30:09,340 --> 04:30:11,340
I

3404
04:30:17,180 --> 04:30:21,980
They're putting pressure on moving them like cuz cuz I'm sitting on my foot. There's pressure against it

3405
04:30:21,980 --> 04:30:23,980
So it's like keeping the station

3406
04:30:24,900 --> 04:30:28,180
You get a little ground out of us a little mouth curve

3407
04:30:28,180 --> 04:30:34,620
Oh, yeah, did I have the ability to make you put air out your nose a little just a little bit faster?

3408
04:30:35,620 --> 04:30:37,620
Yeah, I'm thinking

3409
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:41,900
Crouched no, I'm not I'm not crouching. I'm like sitting on them this time

3410
04:30:41,900 --> 04:30:45,140
But I do go on crouch on the chair sometimes

3411
04:30:45,780 --> 04:30:51,900
Like I was having to send all I was talking to like eight people at once trying to organize something for the girls

3412
04:30:51,900 --> 04:30:54,580
And I was golem crouched on my chair

3413
04:30:55,380 --> 04:31:00,860
Because I was trying to like get it done so fast so I could go to bed because I was exhausted

3414
04:31:01,660 --> 04:31:07,140
I'm like trying to like send this to an editor and upload these files over here and send them off and get the link and make sure

3415
04:31:07,140 --> 04:31:08,900
It's a pretty like oh

3416
04:31:08,900 --> 04:31:10,660
so

3417
04:31:10,660 --> 04:31:12,660
Yeah

3418
04:31:18,260 --> 04:31:22,260
Although they attacked me when I'm Navi as well, so honestly just a wee bit deserve

3419
04:31:22,700 --> 04:31:24,700
Oh

3420
04:31:28,860 --> 04:31:32,260
These things are indestructible honestly

3421
04:31:34,620 --> 04:31:37,260
Should unplug my mouse and keyboard right now just looking

3422
04:31:40,380 --> 04:31:44,420
I'm not even paying attention honestly, I should but

3423
04:31:44,940 --> 04:31:46,940
I

3424
04:31:47,220 --> 04:31:53,900
Think you could probably xp farm here if you had the tolerance for it because you're getting 50 every time and my

3425
04:31:54,420 --> 04:31:56,420
It says I need

3426
04:31:56,420 --> 04:31:58,420
1600 xp to level up

3427
04:31:58,580 --> 04:32:01,780
So yeah, that's the pretty big xp form

3428
04:32:03,500 --> 04:32:05,000
Ow

3429
04:32:05,000 --> 04:32:07,000
my angst

3430
04:32:07,540 --> 04:32:12,220
You're like I got paid to side with the humans. Okay, I got this is

3431
04:32:12,460 --> 04:32:15,300
Not me. I'll put a little disclaimer at the top of the screen. Not me

3432
04:32:19,900 --> 04:32:23,700
You're not funny, but your accent is doing the heavy lifting

3433
04:32:24,740 --> 04:32:29,820
Fucking hell, you're not supposed to say that part out loud. That's supposed to be an inside thought

3434
04:32:32,340 --> 04:32:36,540
Absolutely just got annihilated. Oh my I don't even know if I can come back from that. Oh

3435
04:32:37,740 --> 04:32:39,740
That was brutal

3436
04:32:40,300 --> 04:32:42,700
I can't even come back from that. I

3437
04:32:43,940 --> 04:32:46,540
Got 10 xp from driving over that plan

3438
04:32:48,500 --> 04:32:50,420
Literally

3439
04:32:50,420 --> 04:32:55,300
Okay, the dogs don't get like perish from the bungee

3440
04:32:56,740 --> 04:32:59,820
Which is fine carried by the Scottish

3441
04:33:01,380 --> 04:33:03,380
Literally

3442
04:33:05,060 --> 04:33:07,820
We do have to be careful

3443
04:33:07,940 --> 04:33:09,100
for

3444
04:33:09,100 --> 04:33:11,100
We know

3445
04:33:11,780 --> 04:33:15,340
Do this do the slow mo for me so I can actually oh

3446
04:33:16,060 --> 04:33:18,420
Jeez the way aim ball

3447
04:33:19,620 --> 04:33:26,940
Are you trolling me right now? I'm sorry, but my bullets should have sprayed all over that goodness gravy

3448
04:33:29,420 --> 04:33:31,420
You just like oh I

3449
04:33:33,460 --> 04:33:35,940
Don't like that they win some pain either

3450
04:33:37,820 --> 04:33:39,820
Just feels so mean

3451
04:33:40,220 --> 04:33:42,220
Why are you being so mean?

3452
04:33:43,420 --> 04:33:46,540
You're a mean mean man

3453
04:33:47,380 --> 04:33:50,100
Cuz you're just jealous. Oh

3454
04:33:51,060 --> 04:33:53,260
My gosh, I don't like it. I don't like it

3455
04:33:55,500 --> 04:33:59,940
I'm sure they were probably win some when I was Navi, but it's everything feels so meaner

3456
04:33:59,940 --> 04:34:01,940
I

3457
04:34:03,580 --> 04:34:08,300
I'm going in biz so I can get around here without a tract in the other far away one

3458
04:34:12,660 --> 04:34:18,980
What did that do recovery gather tensile and pulls through our recovery okay my second chance I heard that I heard that I knew you

3459
04:34:21,060 --> 04:34:23,060
Right here we go. Hello

3460
04:34:24,060 --> 04:34:25,060
I

3461
04:34:25,060 --> 04:34:31,380
Just run out here spraying all over. I mean, I'm a cultfish. I don't make sure that it gets far, you know for protection

3462
04:34:32,780 --> 04:34:34,460
to

3463
04:34:34,460 --> 04:34:41,300
Disorientate is it to disorientate creditors and escape the threat and must be whoa whoa whoa

3464
04:34:47,300 --> 04:34:51,820
They have unlimited ammo I do not okay

3465
04:34:53,060 --> 04:34:58,100
Why do I not have unlimited ammo? That's a bit of a problem. I heard that

3466
04:35:02,500 --> 04:35:10,380
I don't see like cuz the camera angle is like way smaller cuz I am smaller as well makes Pandora like even scarier

3467
04:35:13,060 --> 04:35:15,060
Hmm

3468
04:35:16,180 --> 04:35:18,180
The accuracy of our drugs

3469
04:35:23,060 --> 04:35:25,060
Hey

3470
04:35:25,340 --> 04:35:27,340
That is unbelievable

3471
04:35:27,620 --> 04:35:33,220
But that no, it's comedically slow that reverse considering how fast and a

3472
04:35:34,340 --> 04:35:36,020
What's the word?

3473
04:35:36,020 --> 04:35:39,020
Motion sickness and just in the forward spring now

3474
04:35:39,540 --> 04:35:45,820
I've unlocked a grenade launcher. Okay. Maybe maybe mucking around with the weapons would be such a terrible idea

3475
04:35:46,980 --> 04:35:50,140
Trooper pack unlocked some sort of blaze

3476
04:35:51,140 --> 04:35:58,780
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. I'm just driving through here. Then you mean me. No, I'm not looking for any trouble. No

3477
04:36:00,020 --> 04:36:03,380
Just backing up here to my meme the dune buggy

3478
04:36:04,580 --> 04:36:10,380
What's that that music video from gorillas that had like a random buggy in the desert? Oh

3479
04:36:10,940 --> 04:36:12,940
I need a gun

3480
04:36:13,540 --> 04:36:17,340
To keep myself from harm the poor people

3481
04:36:18,300 --> 04:36:20,300
Are burning in the sun

3482
04:36:21,740 --> 04:36:23,740
Go a chance

3483
04:36:34,300 --> 04:36:36,300
Then the buggy out of nowhere

3484
04:36:44,220 --> 04:36:46,220
No way

3485
04:36:47,500 --> 04:36:54,020
Old military set of gearbox don't want to go backwards only forwards towards dying enemy

3486
04:36:56,140 --> 04:37:01,300
This is like a flashback right now. Oh, can you like see the music video in your head as I'm talking about it?

3487
04:37:02,420 --> 04:37:07,940
Can I put images in your head if I talk about things? Oh my god, I never even spoke about that

3488
04:37:08,500 --> 04:37:13,220
So I can't like see things in my head the way others can like the way it's just like I can't do that

3489
04:37:13,340 --> 04:37:16,180
So if I say things does it appear in your head?

3490
04:37:17,980 --> 04:37:19,980
Ah

3491
04:37:21,580 --> 04:37:26,400
Sometimes okay, okay, I'm totally not gonna use that

3492
04:37:28,060 --> 04:37:30,060
Against you at any point

3493
04:37:33,020 --> 04:37:37,180
Can I do a music videos I am now making you think of

3494
04:37:38,260 --> 04:37:44,180
The gorillas music video where noodles is dancing in that room and then the guy

3495
04:37:44,540 --> 04:37:50,140
Has a big head and it goes never did no harm never did no harm

3496
04:38:02,780 --> 04:38:07,980
Wait, it's all the wrong one, I don't know one of them the giant head literally it was just a man

3497
04:38:07,980 --> 04:38:11,860
I saw the comments and someone was like that a key Joe

3498
04:38:12,500 --> 04:38:19,700
Honestly his jaw. So, um, if you ever take the recreational

3499
04:38:20,500 --> 04:38:23,820
and also known as bebex to say and

3500
04:38:25,060 --> 04:38:29,820
That makes your jaw clench or something along that line and

3501
04:38:30,820 --> 04:38:32,060
so

3502
04:38:32,060 --> 04:38:35,300
In scott's you say like all his jaw was spinning

3503
04:38:36,140 --> 04:38:38,580
or like he's got an achy jaw and

3504
04:38:38,860 --> 04:38:40,180
And

3505
04:38:40,180 --> 04:38:43,820
Like the comments were all saying that and we'll watch it back and I was like, oh, wow

3506
04:38:45,180 --> 04:38:50,340
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I'm just a signal specialist. I'm looking for a fight. Excuse me. Excuse me

3507
04:38:50,340 --> 04:38:53,580
No, no, I didn't want to fight leave me alone. Get me in the boat. Get me in the boat

3508
04:38:54,380 --> 04:38:57,540
Jeez Titanic all over again. Get me in that boat. Oh

3509
04:38:59,060 --> 04:39:01,940
I forgot it's just a little more down here. It's dare

3510
04:39:03,340 --> 04:39:05,860
Do you know the song from grills kids with guns? Oh

3511
04:39:06,860 --> 04:39:14,340
No, sorry, I thought you're referencing that music video. I know the what's that other one? I really like humility

3512
04:39:15,260 --> 04:39:17,260
I don't want no

3513
04:39:17,460 --> 04:39:19,460
Isolation

3514
04:39:19,460 --> 04:39:22,260
You see say I'm in now

3515
04:39:27,460 --> 04:39:31,580
Unfortunately, I don't know the words very well like I never oh, I'm just jumping most of them except in all these

3516
04:39:31,580 --> 04:39:34,740
I've unlocked a nail gun veteran pack. I

3517
04:39:35,340 --> 04:39:41,540
Can call in a motor strike hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. This is actually maybe I admit

3518
04:39:41,540 --> 04:39:47,260
It's a little bit cool. I'll definitely keep zoom because it keeps me away significantly increased damage

3519
04:39:49,820 --> 04:39:51,900
Oh, but that one's

3520
04:39:55,060 --> 04:39:59,940
Calling an airstrike destroying every enemy and be aware it takes a few seconds for the strike to arrive

3521
04:40:00,340 --> 04:40:06,460
Maybe just defense I think defense speed and health to get me out of there and whatever the last one was

3522
04:40:07,100 --> 04:40:12,440
Invisibility and zoom get me out of whatever situation I'm in the video with Jack black

3523
04:40:17,020 --> 04:40:25,380
Yeah, yeah, so I'm about to go full fortune it's on the nappy. I don't know what fortune this one is but

3524
04:40:26,300 --> 04:40:32,180
Hot hot take coming in. Oh, I don't like the gorillas. Oh, yeah, that's okay. You don't have to like everything

3525
04:40:33,460 --> 04:40:37,580
Some things are for some people and some things aren't for some people that is how the world work

3526
04:40:37,580 --> 04:40:43,380
I don't think anyone should be punished. However, if you don't like Assassin's Creed brotherhood, then I will happily

3527
04:40:43,940 --> 04:40:45,940
Put you in either

3528
04:40:45,940 --> 04:40:48,300
Mercy's basement or she bees

3529
04:40:48,980 --> 04:40:51,420
Dungeon take your pick, you know up to you

3530
04:40:52,180 --> 04:40:53,340
Um

3531
04:40:53,340 --> 04:40:57,780
Right, we are just skipping through this for those of you have kind of just joined in you're not quite sure what's going on

3532
04:40:57,780 --> 04:41:02,940
Um, we have successfully finished the nappy side of this game

3533
04:41:03,260 --> 04:41:10,320
We are now purposely joining the RDA, which I have never actually played before but we are still in the tutorial section

3534
04:41:10,320 --> 04:41:13,500
So I know what comes up ahead like it's not a big deal or anything like that

3535
04:41:14,020 --> 04:41:16,020
and I

3536
04:41:16,460 --> 04:41:18,460
Prepare a paranoid myself

3537
04:41:18,500 --> 04:41:20,500
You're always a good girl. Whoa

3538
04:41:21,980 --> 04:41:24,260
Hold on a minute, why am I getting praised out nowhere?

3539
04:41:25,740 --> 04:41:29,420
What are they? Oh, what do I do? Oh, what do I do?

3540
04:41:32,620 --> 04:41:35,060
Not everything know everything but no humor

3541
04:41:39,020 --> 04:41:42,780
Remain just noisy. Whoa, where's the print? Whoa. Whoa. You can't be doing this one

3542
04:41:43,700 --> 04:41:49,300
That's not fair. You know like to take me when I'm not prepared. Okay. That's not fair

3543
04:41:50,060 --> 04:41:54,580
That's cheat see doodling don't cheat see doodle. Okay, Dr. Harper. I presume

3544
04:41:55,180 --> 04:41:57,180
You must be rider

3545
04:41:57,180 --> 04:42:02,140
Let's get you a day needs to do something to prepare it. Oh, I mean, I mean you got you got get the guy give good

3546
04:42:04,820 --> 04:42:08,100
Funny, I think people in there are prizes no punishments

3547
04:42:09,540 --> 04:42:11,540
I'm not here to make enemy

3548
04:42:11,700 --> 04:42:16,220
Then we'll get along just fine now, please go and assist

3549
04:42:17,060 --> 04:42:18,260
Oh

3550
04:42:18,260 --> 04:42:24,780
It's gonna be so weird doing the RDA side you listen noob. I need you to grab me some florist

3551
04:42:24,780 --> 04:42:30,020
Listen noob. You ain't afraid of a few carnivorous plants. Are you aren't afraid of a flower among friends?

3552
04:42:30,860 --> 04:42:37,980
We aren't friends. Oh, you need to learn quick. Okay. Jeez. Lois. Talk about being unfriendly around these part

3553
04:42:38,340 --> 04:42:42,700
Make her blush for every bad joke of today's stream. Honestly, it's been pretty rough

3554
04:42:42,700 --> 04:42:48,300
Right if I remember correctly, there's literally

3555
04:42:49,180 --> 04:42:53,900
Yeah, um, okay. I've just noticed that we have infinite ammo on this gun

3556
04:42:54,740 --> 04:42:56,740
One that's not how they work

3557
04:42:56,820 --> 04:42:58,260
to

3558
04:42:58,260 --> 04:43:06,340
Actually, it's a wee bit of a pet peeve the one all we should watch those Keanu Reeve movies because they have the ammo reload thing, correct

3559
04:43:07,100 --> 04:43:12,000
And how am I trying to say it like in movies where they just like

3560
04:43:12,500 --> 04:43:18,300
With a pistol and like pistol literally have seven max like if you're talking like the M7 or something like that

3561
04:43:18,300 --> 04:43:20,500
Why where the enemies I can hear them. Oh

3562
04:43:24,100 --> 04:43:27,860
Well, I did ask to see them and I can see them loud and clear

3563
04:43:28,540 --> 04:43:31,060
Jeez the camp. I'm stuck on something. Oh

3564
04:43:31,660 --> 04:43:37,180
Jesus, I need I need some space. I need some space in order to like actually shoot please game

3565
04:43:38,100 --> 04:43:41,820
If you're not gonna give me aim assist at least let me fricking shoot

3566
04:43:45,700 --> 04:43:50,460
They sound like buzzle gum from Viva Pinata, it's almost like they're based after flies

3567
04:43:50,460 --> 04:43:52,460
Why

3568
04:43:57,380 --> 04:43:59,300
Johnson the Baba Yaga

3569
04:43:59,300 --> 04:44:05,380
Wic. Yes, that one we should watch those because I like how they're actually accurate with the goons

3570
04:44:07,620 --> 04:44:15,580
It's very nice that they're accurate with the reading. I love the way John Wic uses reloads to set the case for gun face

3571
04:44:15,580 --> 04:44:17,580
I don't know you'll notice that that's true

3572
04:44:20,580 --> 04:44:22,580
Unlimited ammo and mass effect

3573
04:44:26,100 --> 04:44:28,100
Someone said I might like mass effect

3574
04:44:28,940 --> 04:44:33,660
I've actually never played the series before but some said I might like it. I

3575
04:44:34,580 --> 04:44:36,580
Know he's called Sheppard

3576
04:44:37,340 --> 04:44:41,180
That's about it. Oh, no, I don't need to do that at all. I'm getting confused

3577
04:44:42,420 --> 04:44:48,740
All the John Wick movies are good. Yeah, speaking of John Wick. Have you played cyberpunk? No, I haven't I watch

3578
04:44:49,220 --> 04:44:51,220
Shia cyberpunk

3579
04:44:51,700 --> 04:44:53,700
but I am

3580
04:44:54,300 --> 04:44:59,780
I am still absolutely heartbroken about Rebecca. I am so sorry. Is it

3581
04:45:01,100 --> 04:45:03,900
Her name is Rebecca. What's the name of the?

3582
04:45:05,220 --> 04:45:06,820
The cyber

3583
04:45:06,820 --> 04:45:09,180
You're over the rainbow here. Is it Lucy?

3584
04:45:09,620 --> 04:45:16,740
Is it Rebecca and Lucy like brotherhood? I'm getting brotherhood. That's awesome screw brother. Wait, it is Rebecca and Lucy

3585
04:45:17,740 --> 04:45:20,460
What are the odds that assassin creep brotherhood and

3586
04:45:21,660 --> 04:45:23,660
cyberpunk the anime I

3587
04:45:24,180 --> 04:45:29,100
Am I am heartbroken over Rebecca? I'm so sorry. I'm gonna see something so controversial

3588
04:45:29,180 --> 04:45:32,540
I have no comprehension no

3589
04:45:33,340 --> 04:45:39,140
Comprehension on how Rebecca just doesn't auto win like people like all this see this

3590
04:45:40,140 --> 04:45:41,780
Lucy

3591
04:45:41,900 --> 04:45:48,940
Lucy are you can you open your eyes and look at how perfect Rebecca is? I'll actually tell you some more development notes and

3592
04:45:49,900 --> 04:45:51,900
You don't have Rebecca's voice

3593
04:45:52,780 --> 04:45:59,380
And on the concept of I see obviously I see before I see you know applied and all of that

3594
04:45:59,620 --> 04:46:02,820
We actually were quite happy to give I see to

3595
04:46:03,980 --> 04:46:09,740
Someone like that may have had a deeper voice because of Rebecca from cyberpunk. So that's a fun

3596
04:46:10,260 --> 04:46:13,580
Behind-the-scenes and I am not over Rebecca my first

3597
04:46:15,020 --> 04:46:17,020
Trigger I

3598
04:46:17,060 --> 04:46:21,220
Actually, I'm interested in potentially cosplaying her for an ace more stream

3599
04:46:21,220 --> 04:46:25,460
And I think that would be a hoot and holler and I won't show my face

3600
04:46:25,940 --> 04:46:27,940
I'd not

3601
04:46:28,140 --> 04:46:30,140
I'm not for that and

3602
04:46:30,860 --> 04:46:32,860
But I'm happy to do like

3603
04:46:33,340 --> 04:46:34,540
a

3604
04:46:34,540 --> 04:46:36,540
Nick down

3605
04:46:36,860 --> 04:46:44,180
I'm good to sip of my honey tea to see if it's a sip but yeah, I don't know Lucy everyone arguing about Rebecca and Lucy

3606
04:46:44,180 --> 04:46:48,180
I'm like, how is anyone looking at Lucy Rebecca's just peak like design everything

3607
04:46:52,420 --> 04:46:58,140
You know, it's a really sad detail if you haven't seen the cyberpunk anime close your ears for about two minutes

3608
04:46:59,140 --> 04:47:04,300
And after no, no, I need to say this part out loud close your ears for two minutes

3609
04:47:04,300 --> 04:47:09,500
If you don't want spoilers about cyberpunk the anime the really sad fact is that Rebecca

3610
04:47:09,940 --> 04:47:11,940
Got an upgrade to her hands

3611
04:47:12,380 --> 04:47:19,700
after her brother died to the the crazy guy because of the blowback she got from the shotgun

3612
04:47:19,780 --> 04:47:26,780
She never gets any root ricochet from shotguns anymore after that fact after that scene and it's such a sad fact

3613
04:47:26,780 --> 04:47:28,780
But yeah, and

3614
04:47:29,460 --> 04:47:32,720
Anyway, sorry back to the camp back to the actual gameplay

3615
04:47:34,100 --> 04:47:36,100
I'm just really passionate

3616
04:47:36,780 --> 04:47:39,980
The cyber cycle. Yeah, so the cyber cycle takes out her brother

3617
04:47:39,980 --> 04:47:45,940
But in that scene she shoots a shotgun at him and she goes backwards and then after that moment her

3618
04:47:46,740 --> 04:47:53,820
Her hand upgrades come in like her fisty cuffs and she never experiences recoil when shooting weaponry

3619
04:47:54,220 --> 04:47:56,220
And it's all because of that incident

3620
04:47:56,780 --> 04:47:58,780
And it's so sad

3621
04:47:59,180 --> 04:48:03,100
But her design is just beautiful. Absolutely beautiful

3622
04:48:04,980 --> 04:48:06,980
Let me drink my tea

3623
04:48:09,100 --> 04:48:14,420
The recoil so a little background on Rebecca studio trigger was asked to change her because

3624
04:48:14,860 --> 04:48:17,980
Her design was too lollipop a trigger went now lollipops these

3625
04:48:19,420 --> 04:48:21,660
Rebecca definitely influenced I see

3626
04:48:22,580 --> 04:48:29,540
Creation with the hips area and the legs. I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise a peak design. Sorry I

3627
04:48:31,900 --> 04:48:37,340
Knew from the get-go. I wanted a troupe a tan, which is what Emy was and then I see

3628
04:48:38,340 --> 04:48:39,660
and

3629
04:48:39,660 --> 04:48:41,660
It's not true pattern

3630
04:48:41,660 --> 04:48:49,260
but and but I did want her to have like the thickness of Rebecca basically it is I mean

3631
04:48:49,260 --> 04:48:51,260
I'm happy to talk about development. I know it's and

3632
04:48:51,660 --> 04:48:56,860
Like a Zura. We knew we wanted a chocolate and thick. So we've got a goddess and

3633
04:48:57,820 --> 04:49:02,540
Yeah, we just took it from there. Obviously. Um, sorry, let me finish this to you. Oh

3634
04:49:07,300 --> 04:49:09,300
Yeah

3635
04:49:10,900 --> 04:49:17,460
Adam Sandler said you look like a cut of me. Are you wait in the game? I'm pretty sure that's from the game

3636
04:49:17,460 --> 04:49:19,460
I'm sure I've seen a clip of that game

3637
04:49:21,660 --> 04:49:23,660
Coming down with the

3638
04:49:25,700 --> 04:49:29,340
I'll actually tell you some other developmental notes, you know, if I had a lighter voice

3639
04:49:30,780 --> 04:49:32,620
a me

3640
04:49:32,620 --> 04:49:36,380
Amie's design and every in lore and everything if I had a lighter voice

3641
04:49:37,140 --> 04:49:39,140
I

3642
04:49:40,020 --> 04:49:42,020
Would death will be a

3643
04:49:42,020 --> 04:49:44,660
I would death will reflect if I had a lighter voice

3644
04:49:44,660 --> 04:49:49,700
But unfortunately I don't and so, you know, I take like the the big sister look approach

3645
04:49:52,620 --> 04:49:59,940
Yeah, don't be surprised if it an alternative outfits, so I look a bit more true to myself and I am

3646
04:50:02,420 --> 04:50:04,900
I suppose I'm a Rebecca. How tall is Rebecca?

3647
04:50:06,260 --> 04:50:10,300
No, I do it in centimeters. Don't give me freedom units. I can't do freedom units

3648
04:50:11,500 --> 04:50:17,820
But I guess Rebecca's really very reflective. I think that's probably why I'm gravitated towards her so much as well

3649
04:50:18,820 --> 04:50:21,700
Because I'm just like hey, like I just love her

3650
04:50:23,100 --> 04:50:27,540
I'm gonna leave for the night. So here's your bro teeth brushing. Yes. Thank you

3651
04:50:28,140 --> 04:50:31,860
So I'm gonna burp my tea up if I'm not careful hold on a minute

3652
04:50:33,500 --> 04:50:41,540
No, I'm just gonna check how far away my my delivery is of my Mac is my cheeky Mac is any any Mac

3653
04:50:48,820 --> 04:50:55,220
It's still on its way freaking driver at the restaurant always driver at the restaurant

3654
04:50:55,220 --> 04:50:57,380
It's never drivers picked it up and it's already on its way

3655
04:50:57,380 --> 04:51:00,980
It's always at the restaurant just hanging about waiting for a second freaking order. I

3656
04:51:02,820 --> 04:51:04,820
Know that shit's gonna get here cool

3657
04:51:05,060 --> 04:51:08,060
The version 2.0 update they did on smashers

3658
04:51:09,300 --> 04:51:15,700
He needed the update who's smash her she's a hundred and forty five one fifty. Oh, I'm too tall for Rebecca

3659
04:51:18,700 --> 04:51:21,180
Oh, I need to get at that to the same board

3660
04:51:24,660 --> 04:51:26,660
For now, I'll just use my

3661
04:51:27,780 --> 04:51:29,780
Adam's matter. Oh

3662
04:51:30,660 --> 04:51:37,300
The guy that says the quote she's around one five two wait. I'm out. No, I'm not I'm one six. Okay

3663
04:51:40,300 --> 04:51:45,540
Okay, take Rebecca and make her slightly taller. Oh my god me. She's so me for real for real

3664
04:51:46,220 --> 04:51:48,220
She's so me for real

3665
04:51:51,060 --> 04:51:54,660
Behold how tall she's streaming on out. Mm-hmm. True. Oh

3666
04:51:57,380 --> 04:51:59,380
No, it's time

3667
04:52:00,140 --> 04:52:02,140
We're the baddies

3668
04:52:02,860 --> 04:52:07,820
He said the B word wait, why the stuff that was put the B word together

3669
04:52:08,780 --> 04:52:09,980
Oh

3670
04:52:09,980 --> 04:52:16,980
I'm sad. I don't want to expect from here on out though. It's Johnny told Rebecca comes honestly

3671
04:52:19,980 --> 04:52:21,980
We can't see

3672
04:52:23,500 --> 04:52:30,020
The donations are broken again. Are they actually great work, right? I smell promotion in the air. Oh, yeah, pay

3673
04:52:31,860 --> 04:52:36,020
Better not. Please tell me you guys haven't given me so much money. It's broken again

3674
04:52:38,620 --> 04:52:44,300
Have you broken it again, be honest be honest. There's a page not load. I

Like the edits of John Wick and cyberpunk so funny of him see yes. Oh my god

3676
04:52:50,420 --> 04:52:55,540
I wanted to do that with the girls debuts, but I don't have time. I have the highlight

3677
04:52:56,140 --> 04:52:59,620
There are currently two out of six highlight debuts

3678
04:53:00,420 --> 04:53:03,660
Created so far and I'm so excited

3679
04:53:04,500 --> 04:53:08,340
It mercies and azures, but I'm gonna release them all at the same time

3680
04:53:09,140 --> 04:53:11,860
but mercies and azures have been made and

3681
04:53:12,860 --> 04:53:15,180
The rest are on the way. It's so exciting

3682
04:53:16,060 --> 04:53:19,260
It's loading but not going through it. Wow. I really is broke. Wow

3683
04:53:20,820 --> 04:53:22,820
Thanks again for breaking

3684
04:53:24,340 --> 04:53:26,340
Are you guys at all?

3685
04:53:30,300 --> 04:53:32,900
It's never never we're the baddies

3686
04:53:34,100 --> 04:53:36,660
Against these guys we can take them

3687
04:53:38,940 --> 04:53:42,500
Let's do it right now right now. I order you to shoot

3688
04:53:44,300 --> 04:53:46,620
Well, this is it

3689
04:53:48,180 --> 04:53:50,180
This is it

3690
04:53:51,980 --> 04:53:53,980
We're doing it we're the baddies

3691
04:53:56,140 --> 04:53:58,140
We'll just spam them down I guess

3692
04:53:59,140 --> 04:54:01,140
I

3693
04:54:01,620 --> 04:54:03,620
Missing because of the hit marker

3694
04:54:05,100 --> 04:54:11,060
Please don't heal don't make this harder than it has to be unironically because I'm not I feel bad

3695
04:54:12,420 --> 04:54:14,420
I picked the woman's

3696
04:54:18,540 --> 04:54:20,540
I

3697
04:54:21,740 --> 04:54:26,140
Didn't think that was possible. Have you broken it twice? Hold on

3698
04:54:28,820 --> 04:54:30,820
You feel

3699
04:54:35,460 --> 04:54:41,540
Wait, what happens? No, I can't be a Navi like I'm a fully human like I'll never be able to go back

3700
04:54:42,300 --> 04:54:47,060
Wait a word good girl. Oh, yeah, so it does work

3701
04:54:49,300 --> 04:54:53,220
Thank you for the tip no, I don't know what to respond to that

3702
04:54:54,100 --> 04:54:56,100
Maybe

3703
04:54:58,900 --> 04:55:03,420
Well, wait, so it does work and maybe just Tame and yo because it's

3704
04:55:14,140 --> 04:55:16,140
It works in fire folks

3705
04:55:16,140 --> 04:55:21,140
Anyway, you don't actually have to tip or donate or anything

3706
04:55:22,060 --> 04:55:24,060
But thank you very much

3707
04:55:27,660 --> 04:55:31,340
We just got annihilated by a Banshee cheese. Oh

3708
04:55:33,380 --> 04:55:36,700
Well, we all saw that move in the frame, but hey, oh

3709
04:55:38,540 --> 04:55:41,540
Okay, this is actually quite different. I thought he was just gonna

3710
04:55:46,180 --> 04:55:49,940
Wow, I didn't even know

3711
04:55:53,660 --> 04:55:55,660
We don't have to but we want to give her

3712
04:55:58,860 --> 04:56:00,780
Oh my gosh, okay

3713
04:56:02,300 --> 04:56:06,100
Well, we survived a helicopter crash and an attack from an akra

3714
04:56:06,100 --> 04:56:11,060
Are you all right? I think I'm okay, but the pilots banged up pretty bad

3715
04:56:11,780 --> 04:56:14,620
Radio's fried, too. You've got to go for help

3716
04:56:19,820 --> 04:56:23,340
Don't worry, I'll be fine. I've got a full clip any vultures

3717
04:56:25,220 --> 04:56:27,220
Have to go out on my own

3718
04:56:28,900 --> 04:56:31,900
No, I don't want to go out on my own. I'm scared

3719
04:56:32,660 --> 04:56:34,660
Oh

3720
04:56:37,580 --> 04:56:43,740
Have I got you oh wait, so is this my wardrobe change? Oh, I literally is it's just more

3721
04:56:48,500 --> 04:56:54,300
That's just follow the hood that says to go this way what she shouldn't she shouldn't what she is

3722
04:56:55,060 --> 04:56:57,580
Things can attack me from the sky as well

3723
04:56:58,100 --> 04:57:00,100
Hmm

3724
04:57:00,460 --> 04:57:03,540
Wait, these aren't recycled maps at all

3725
04:57:05,780 --> 04:57:09,900
No, the plan I'm scared wait, I can't have a limit on

3726
04:57:15,940 --> 04:57:19,420
Is it maybe the head is gonna take more damage

3727
04:57:20,420 --> 04:57:22,420
I

3728
04:57:24,060 --> 04:57:26,940
Flamethrowers are effective against all plants that have one

3729
04:57:32,060 --> 04:57:37,540
Don't have a flamethrower. Oh I have infinite pistol. Okay. Okay

3730
04:57:40,580 --> 04:57:42,580
I have to show my shooting skills

3731
04:57:42,940 --> 04:57:50,460
Literally, I thought they were just gonna recycle all of the maps, but this is like an entirely new side of the game

3732
04:57:50,460 --> 04:57:54,560
I know this sounds so silly, but I just assumed the recycle the maps and like oh

3733
04:57:55,900 --> 04:57:57,900
I'm claiming that all right

3734
04:58:01,180 --> 04:58:03,100
Okay, I can do it

3735
04:58:06,220 --> 04:58:08,220
Okay, I've got more ammo

3736
04:58:09,020 --> 04:58:11,540
Did he do the ikran?

3737
04:58:12,580 --> 04:58:22,820
Okay, I get points for this. Oh, I'm so tiny. I'm so small. I can't even I can't even see over the freaking grass to see the enemies

3738
04:58:25,220 --> 04:58:28,460
Oh my gosh, give me more ammo. Oh

3739
04:58:29,860 --> 04:58:32,380
Stop spawning in I need to heal

3740
04:58:33,820 --> 04:58:35,820
Right, we're doing a biz

3741
04:58:37,380 --> 04:58:39,380
There's one over

3742
04:58:39,380 --> 04:58:41,380
Oh

3743
04:58:59,940 --> 04:59:03,980
I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I need a level up so quick so I can just keep spamming that run

3744
04:59:03,980 --> 04:59:05,980
Oh

3745
04:59:09,020 --> 04:59:11,020
There's so many plants in the way as well

3746
04:59:16,180 --> 04:59:20,180
I'm so tall. I'm so small. I'm not myself tall. Oh

3747
04:59:21,620 --> 04:59:24,100
I can't do it. I'm actually sweating right now

3748
04:59:28,220 --> 04:59:32,300
Can I make it through the poison without having to destroy them all the time? Oh

3749
04:59:33,980 --> 04:59:35,980
Please keep your ink to yourself

3750
04:59:36,540 --> 04:59:39,620
What are these? Are these bombs? Oh

3751
04:59:41,420 --> 04:59:44,460
I think the pretty I don't the purple have health. I think they're

3752
04:59:51,180 --> 04:59:55,220
Well, there's no secret behind this waterfall like in Legend of Zelda

3753
04:59:56,220 --> 05:00:01,220
Right, let's try that again. I didn't know me. Yeah, I didn't know me to the oh good as we

3754
05:00:02,180 --> 05:00:06,780
Using vehicles and amp suits will be your friend. Okay, so I'm gonna says oh

3755
05:00:09,060 --> 05:00:13,060
Moby heart, right, let's try that again without doing that

3756
05:00:14,540 --> 05:00:16,540
No running

3757
05:00:16,660 --> 05:00:21,700
Just shoot. Why are you not responding? Can I respond or my game already broke?

3758
05:00:23,540 --> 05:00:30,080
All right, hold on hold on. I think my delivery app just a just oh, oh my delivery

3759
05:00:30,440 --> 05:00:35,620
Hold on. We've got a food delivery. Is that gonna swipe for me as a health bar?

3760
05:00:36,680 --> 05:00:38,680
Hold on. Let me go at the front door

3761
05:01:00,080 --> 05:01:02,080
Oh

3762
05:01:02,080 --> 05:01:04,080
Oh

3763
05:01:04,080 --> 05:01:06,080
Oh

3764
05:01:26,760 --> 05:01:28,760
There

3765
05:01:35,080 --> 05:01:40,680
Oh, yeah, okay, I'm glad that thing doesn't slip down and like take my fricking eyeballs out must go

3766
05:01:42,520 --> 05:01:48,960
Rather terrifying my McDonald right. I've got chicken nuggies for everyone open your mouth go

3767
05:01:54,760 --> 05:01:56,760
Wow, I've got

3768
05:01:57,760 --> 05:02:04,360
Is the fricking how you call it this the thingy my Bulbas

3769
05:02:09,320 --> 05:02:12,560
Why the wicked it is so bad for me

3770
05:02:14,520 --> 05:02:16,520
But if it's bad for me

3771
05:02:20,360 --> 05:02:25,200
Well, it's a lamp in the Navy so brave. I'm sorry. I'm so bad at this like

3772
05:02:27,760 --> 05:02:33,760
Mmm, you're having a sip of my chocolate milkshake. Yes, I'm actually having a chocolate milk shake at 9 a.m

3773
05:02:33,760 --> 05:02:35,760
And then nothing you can do about it

3774
05:02:39,640 --> 05:02:44,880
Is it cold you bet your ass it's cold because that guy was sitting at a flipping restaurant for ages

3775
05:02:45,960 --> 05:02:49,640
Okay, um, I would tab out to read any

3776
05:02:50,480 --> 05:02:56,160
Marshmallows, however the game breaks when I do that. So I'm just gonna read chat and munch away

3777
05:02:57,520 --> 05:03:03,880
So, please if you don't like munching sounds and he's live. She's live, but me I'm a munching your ears

3778
05:03:08,280 --> 05:03:10,920
I'm having a beer at 7 a.m. I

3779
05:03:14,160 --> 05:03:18,600
Will enjoy my new they just spicy nuggies so I've got spicy

3780
05:03:22,520 --> 05:03:24,520
And mukbang time honestly

3781
05:03:27,760 --> 05:03:30,440
More headpats for the most adorable cutlery

3782
05:03:35,600 --> 05:03:37,360
Okay

3783
05:03:37,360 --> 05:03:42,960
Hopefully I don't mess up too many times actually doing the RDA campaign, but I have to admit

3784
05:03:42,960 --> 05:03:46,960
It's like terrifying. I had no I thought the maps were gonna be the same and I was like, okay

3785
05:03:46,960 --> 05:03:49,920
At least the maps are the same and I'm familiar with the past. Nope

3786
05:03:51,640 --> 05:03:53,640
Mmm

3787
05:03:54,320 --> 05:03:58,200
I don't they apparently sold 2.7 million copies of this game

3788
05:03:59,040 --> 05:04:05,000
Yeah, that seems really low for like any game. I feel like that. Does that mean it full-option?

3789
05:04:09,360 --> 05:04:14,000
Mm-hmm, I'm gonna inspire people to get a McDonald's breakfast at this rate

3790
05:04:17,080 --> 05:04:19,080
You it

3791
05:04:20,080 --> 05:04:26,320
A little hard in America they do 24 hour breakfast, so I'm jealous. I have to admit

3792
05:04:34,840 --> 05:04:38,360
You still think the tips are slightly broken or you're getting limited. Oh

3793
05:04:41,040 --> 05:04:43,040
Hmm

3794
05:04:43,880 --> 05:04:45,880
I'm not sure

3795
05:04:46,200 --> 05:04:47,440
That

3796
05:04:47,440 --> 05:04:52,240
Last tip did come through I wonder why that would be maybe reach every region locked

3797
05:04:53,720 --> 05:04:55,960
No, that seems silly, that's the answer I

3798
05:04:58,120 --> 05:05:03,440
Don't like break I don't like the breakfast menu of most fast food places rather try it for me menus on

3799
05:05:05,800 --> 05:05:12,480
I know it sounds weird, but I love to make some nuggies a salad and put them both together and

3800
05:05:13,200 --> 05:05:16,880
Wheatwrap and yogurt that just sounds like a

3801
05:05:17,880 --> 05:05:19,360
and

3802
05:05:19,360 --> 05:05:22,080
What's that Greek thing? Where's the chicken in a wrap?

3803
05:05:23,040 --> 05:05:26,240
I've completely not kebab, but like it's on different

3804
05:05:27,720 --> 05:05:29,720
We're back in 10 minutes

3805
05:05:30,800 --> 05:05:32,800
See you shortly

3806
05:05:33,480 --> 05:05:35,480
and a

3807
05:05:35,880 --> 05:05:37,160
Jiro

3808
05:05:37,160 --> 05:05:41,160
Fun fact gyro means to be on benefits in Scotland

3809
05:05:43,440 --> 05:05:47,760
Alarm gyro, okay gyro is great. Oh, but it's with pork. Okay. Okay. Oh

3810
05:05:48,720 --> 05:05:50,720
It's over

3811
05:05:51,200 --> 05:05:53,200
It's pronounced you know

3812
05:05:53,560 --> 05:05:56,600
Then why did the Fanny's put a G in front of it?

3813
05:06:01,240 --> 05:06:07,160
We've got them got them in 4k as I drop a chip on me. Oh

3814
05:06:07,280 --> 05:06:09,280
Oh

3815
05:06:12,120 --> 05:06:14,280
It's and it's gif

3816
05:06:15,040 --> 05:06:21,440
It's not a Jeff. It's a gif. I don't know why Jeff started and if your name is Jeff

3817
05:06:22,680 --> 05:06:26,000
Or should I be like, I can grasp your names Jeff because it sounds like Jeff I

3818
05:06:28,840 --> 05:06:34,960
Don't comprehend where Jeff came from unless it was from non native English speakers. That's the only like and

3819
05:06:35,960 --> 05:06:42,920
Thingy, I don't know why it is a thing. Obviously. It's funny in internet culture, but why is it Jeff?

3820
05:06:43,960 --> 05:06:45,960
I know Jeff literally

3821
05:06:49,960 --> 05:06:54,240
My name is Jeff I feels good man. I'm sorry

3822
05:06:57,000 --> 05:07:01,160
Literally G and gif it's also there's a second and

3823
05:07:01,960 --> 05:07:06,640
The UK it's a shop called pray mark. Okay. It's like a clothes shop. It's like and

3824
05:07:07,880 --> 05:07:14,320
It's called pray mark, but folks say it pre mark and the folk that say it pre mark

3825
05:07:14,320 --> 05:07:16,820
I'm talking to you right now directly

3826
05:07:17,320 --> 05:07:21,920
Do you say primary school or do you say primary school?

3827
05:07:22,800 --> 05:07:29,100
You say primary school. So the shop is called pray mark and I will not like let's oh

3828
05:07:29,380 --> 05:07:31,380
Congrats if you names mark by the way

3829
05:07:38,340 --> 05:07:40,340
I don't know why

3830
05:07:41,180 --> 05:07:43,780
It's a debate and the UK

3831
05:07:44,620 --> 05:07:46,180
Pray Murray

3832
05:07:46,180 --> 05:07:52,100
It's the same one pre mark noise. No, it's pray mark primary school pray mark

3833
05:07:52,740 --> 05:07:55,340
Hi to all marks. Yeah. Hi mark. Hi

3834
05:07:56,420 --> 05:07:58,420
Congrats if you names mark

3835
05:07:59,140 --> 05:08:02,300
Also, Jeff is a peanut butter company. Is it

3836
05:08:14,620 --> 05:08:15,980
Okay

3837
05:08:15,980 --> 05:08:17,980
our peanut butter and

3838
05:08:18,140 --> 05:08:20,860
And jelly sandwiches actually is tasty as

3839
05:08:21,740 --> 05:08:27,980
American movies make it out to be because all kids unanimously in TV shows have a PB and J

3840
05:08:28,260 --> 05:08:32,440
Is it actually that good or is it being hyped up as I choke on my food?

3841
05:08:38,500 --> 05:08:43,660
It's a comfort food. Yes, it's okay. She seems to think so. Okay. She be's word is law

3842
05:08:44,220 --> 05:08:49,320
Yes, it's overhyped. Yes. It's an acquired taste. It's good yet. PB and J is good

3843
05:08:49,940 --> 05:08:52,860
They can't be it's okay. Diabetes in a sandwich

3844
05:08:53,380 --> 05:08:55,380
I

3845
05:08:55,620 --> 05:08:59,620
Absolutely, they're a good tree. Okay. It's a tree kind of not like a everyday thing

3846
05:09:01,300 --> 05:09:04,980
Mmm, I skipped the jelly and only the peanut bar

3847
05:09:07,020 --> 05:09:09,020
I've tried the jar ones it's

3848
05:09:09,540 --> 05:09:11,540
Pretty okay, but just okay

3849
05:09:11,820 --> 05:09:15,780
It's a thing they are raised on so as a result. They love it. Mmm. I

3850
05:09:16,740 --> 05:09:21,860
Suppose like iron brews my example if you don't drink iron brews a kid, you'll never have a taste for it

3851
05:09:22,860 --> 05:09:24,860
It's so bizarre and flavor

3852
05:09:26,220 --> 05:09:28,220
It's like that and

3853
05:09:28,860 --> 05:09:30,860
Japanese natto

3854
05:09:31,300 --> 05:09:33,300
fermented soybeans is a breakfast thing

3855
05:09:34,380 --> 05:09:37,020
apparently if you are a back-of-guy gene and

3856
05:09:38,060 --> 05:09:44,060
You like it's really hard to enjoy natto unless you like force yourself to eat it over a while and then you get used to that

3857
05:09:46,140 --> 05:09:48,900
Yeah, like it's hard it's hard to get into it. Mmm

3858
05:09:49,860 --> 05:09:54,700
Remember the old commercial from it made from

3859
05:09:56,060 --> 05:09:58,060
Gerders

3860
05:09:59,980 --> 05:10:02,420
It's cheap as heck and that's why we eat it so much

3861
05:10:03,420 --> 05:10:07,620
I've had peanut butter toast and banana and it's delicious. It's very nice

3862
05:10:07,740 --> 05:10:14,500
What's iron brews supposed to taste like they advertise it as ginger and bubblegum and it tastes like battery acid that's only

3863
05:10:14,980 --> 05:10:16,140
explicable

3864
05:10:16,140 --> 05:10:21,620
Way that you can see what that orange liquid tastes like it's battery acid, but nice

3865
05:10:24,060 --> 05:10:26,060
Mmm

3866
05:10:28,700 --> 05:10:31,820
Literally mountain juice is the closest you'll ever get to it

3867
05:10:32,980 --> 05:10:38,060
That is just not positive. Sorry. I'm trying to eat and talk and I want to eat the food as fast as possible

3868
05:10:38,060 --> 05:10:40,700
So I'm not holding up the gameplay too much. Hmm. I

3869
05:10:41,660 --> 05:10:43,660
Take a drink from my chucky milkshake

3870
05:10:46,940 --> 05:10:52,940
Hmm, they forgot to give me a straw. So I'm literally just drinking out of it like some animal

3871
05:10:56,460 --> 05:11:00,780
Hmm, do you see mountain dew? Yes, I said mountain dew

3872
05:11:03,660 --> 05:11:05,660
Oh dude, no

3873
05:11:06,300 --> 05:11:10,940
Mountain dew, mountain dew, mountain dew. Whoa, that's so close

3874
05:11:11,580 --> 05:11:15,180
Mountain dew. Whoa, you can't tell the difference when I say that

3875
05:11:16,300 --> 05:11:18,300
Oh, that's crazy. Mountain dew

3876
05:11:19,180 --> 05:11:22,140
Whoa, it sounds like I'm saying Jay, but I'm no

3877
05:11:23,100 --> 05:11:25,100
I'm saying you

3878
05:11:25,740 --> 05:11:27,740
Oh, that's so cool

3879
05:11:29,660 --> 05:11:33,020
Did you drink my manju? Oh, that's weird

3880
05:11:35,660 --> 05:11:40,940
Mmm, okay, I didn't know I said I like that because I'm here now literally

3881
05:11:41,900 --> 05:11:43,900
Did you drink my manju?

3882
05:11:44,860 --> 05:11:48,300
Wow, why does it sound like that? I can hear it. No, do you

3883
05:11:49,740 --> 05:11:52,460
Did you drink my mountain dew?

3884
05:11:54,220 --> 05:11:56,220
Dew

3885
05:11:58,380 --> 05:12:01,100
Yeah, I've tried manju. I don't think it tastes like I'm brutal

3886
05:12:01,100 --> 05:12:07,180
No, but it's it's only the closest thing. It's a German. I feel not good here. Monka is bro

3887
05:12:07,180 --> 05:12:09,180
Love

3888
05:12:12,780 --> 05:12:20,700
To do a drop of dew and a dew gets all the same pronunciation

3889
05:12:29,900 --> 05:12:31,900
You now have a new earworm enjoy

3890
05:12:32,860 --> 05:12:38,620
All right, I've got two more nuggies left and then I've got this like uh burger mcgrittle thingy

3891
05:12:38,620 --> 05:12:42,860
I don't know what it's called. It's called mcmuffin. That's what we call it mcmuffin, but I think it's called mcgrittle

3892
05:12:46,940 --> 05:12:50,460
Mountain dew was originally made to be a mixer for whiskey

3893
05:12:54,060 --> 05:12:57,340
I don't know when I'm gonna do my first like drunk stream

3894
05:12:58,300 --> 05:13:02,700
I'm down for drunk karaoke, but I would have to rest my voice a day before

3895
05:13:05,260 --> 05:13:10,540
I was very nervous about it like the first time I ever did it, but now I know that

3896
05:13:11,500 --> 05:13:14,380
I'm not hitting them notes. So I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna send it

3897
05:13:14,620 --> 05:13:16,620
Mmm

3898
05:13:24,780 --> 05:13:31,580
The original coca-cola had cocaine in it. Honestly, I just know that

3899
05:13:33,500 --> 05:13:36,940
It would just have been such a good time to be drinking that stuff, you know what I'm saying

3900
05:13:37,420 --> 05:13:39,420
I

3901
05:13:40,940 --> 05:13:49,660
I'm sure I learned as well that um, what did I learn that they used to prescribe like um

3902
05:13:51,500 --> 05:13:56,140
I was a heroine they used to prescribe that if you were feeling rough back in the day

3903
05:13:59,180 --> 05:14:02,860
The drunk stream would give a hundred percent a hundred out of hand barb, I'm sorry

3904
05:14:03,420 --> 05:14:10,860
Here in brazil come to brazil many restaurants serve nuggets with creamy cheese or green green sauce

3905
05:14:11,260 --> 05:14:14,540
What would green sauce consist of would be some sort of veggie blended up

3906
05:14:16,460 --> 05:14:18,460
I would do cheese sauce definitely

3907
05:14:20,300 --> 05:14:22,300
Sorry, I'm looking my fingers like an animal

3908
05:14:26,060 --> 05:14:31,100
Most of the nasty addictive drugs started as medicines honestly like they were just having a good time back then

3909
05:14:31,980 --> 05:14:36,300
I just choked. Um, I don't know if you've ever heard about this guy called Sigmund Freud

3910
05:14:37,020 --> 05:14:42,140
He was absolutely wild and with his theories, but he was also highly addicted to

3911
05:14:42,940 --> 05:14:44,780
and um

3912
05:14:44,780 --> 05:14:51,660
Like a lot of his stuff got discredited, but like as time progresses he gets proven right again and again

3913
05:14:52,060 --> 05:14:54,060
Um

3914
05:14:59,580 --> 05:15:06,860
Also, there is the oh my god, this looks fucking awesome. I'm gonna take a big juicy bite for you

3915
05:15:11,100 --> 05:15:13,020
Oh

3916
05:15:13,020 --> 05:15:16,460
I went out yesterday after stream to get those american sweets

3917
05:15:17,340 --> 05:15:19,340
um

3918
05:15:19,420 --> 05:15:22,860
The lady was so nice. She was like, oh, can I help you anything?

3919
05:15:23,820 --> 05:15:25,500
and I'm just like

3920
05:15:25,500 --> 05:15:27,500
Anything american you've got

3921
05:15:27,980 --> 05:15:29,980
That's like smaller packaging

3922
05:15:30,780 --> 05:15:33,740
I would love to take away with me because i'm just gonna taste it all

3923
05:15:34,460 --> 05:15:36,460
And she was like so nice and helpful

3924
05:15:36,540 --> 05:15:42,460
But she was so surprised with how much i'm buying and I didn't want to be like, oh i'm written them on a stream and all that

3925
05:15:42,540 --> 05:15:46,460
I was just like, I'm just really passionate about american sweets. Yeehaw

3926
05:15:47,420 --> 05:15:49,420
All right

3927
05:15:52,780 --> 05:15:55,020
Hmm it was like a

3928
05:15:57,420 --> 05:16:01,340
Ammonpaw independent shop that I supported

3929
05:16:03,740 --> 05:16:12,380
And I'm gonna inhale another bite. This is good. Yeehaw. Sorry, that is that's just what I imagined like am I at yeehaw at any moment yeehaw

3930
05:16:12,380 --> 05:16:21,980
They used to prescribe, they used to prescribe smoking at people we asked them off. That's terrible. Go on a brother

3931
05:16:24,300 --> 05:16:29,180
You got a pretty accurate spread of my, well like I put the picture in the discord for the girls to rate it

3932
05:16:30,060 --> 05:16:31,900
and I told them

3933
05:16:31,900 --> 05:16:37,740
I spent 53 dollars getting all of that stuff and they were like you got absolutely scammed

3934
05:16:38,140 --> 05:16:41,260
Like that's not even worth 12 dollars. I'm like, oh, okay

3935
05:16:42,140 --> 05:16:45,100
But um, I'm gonna make a little

3936
05:16:46,380 --> 05:16:47,980
Rate thing

3937
05:16:47,980 --> 05:16:49,020
um

3938
05:16:49,020 --> 05:16:50,780
Like where I rate them

3939
05:16:50,780 --> 05:16:55,100
So hopefully we'll do a fun little chart. I don't know if I'm gonna like anything

3940
05:16:57,580 --> 05:17:05,660
I think I'm interested in this was it spicy cheetos I call or spicy thingy or the or tackies or whatever

3941
05:17:06,220 --> 05:17:08,220
I always hear about tacky

3942
05:17:08,540 --> 05:17:09,660
um

3943
05:17:09,660 --> 05:17:11,660
And it was

3944
05:17:15,500 --> 05:17:17,500
Mmm

3945
05:17:18,620 --> 05:17:22,780
It was rough, but like I'm gonna support like a wee independent shop. So

3946
05:17:25,820 --> 05:17:30,540
Eat the chips last it's overpowering. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. We're getting the strats. Thank you, mayor

3947
05:17:30,700 --> 05:17:32,220
See for the strats

3948
05:17:32,220 --> 05:17:37,420
Are you streaming the day? Well we T-minus well less than four hours for mercies. Use your start time

3949
05:17:37,980 --> 05:17:39,980
I

3950
05:17:44,300 --> 05:17:50,060
Don't know what don't I thought dr. Pepper was in the uk but

3951
05:17:52,300 --> 05:17:57,580
I think I'm confusing it with pepsi. I genuinely can't remember if I've ever tried dr. Pepper if it's an american thing

3952
05:18:01,180 --> 05:18:05,340
Oh, you're playing that climbing game. I remember the thumbnail

3953
05:18:07,660 --> 05:18:12,220
Because we had your skirt was open so we had to close your skirt

3954
05:18:14,460 --> 05:18:20,380
Honestly, maybe that should be a toggle for you. No, I'm not. Maybe we should toggle that so you don't have to worry

3955
05:18:26,220 --> 05:18:31,340
Dr. Pepper isn't the okay. I've just never tasted it before literally i'm brewing cola

3956
05:18:31,900 --> 05:18:36,140
I used to be a fan of fiend and a sprite fiend as well

3957
05:18:37,020 --> 05:18:39,420
But fan are like addicted to so much

3958
05:18:43,500 --> 05:18:50,860
I do have an american dr. Pepper so at least I can stay true to the the task at hand not my open skirt, honestly

3959
05:18:55,580 --> 05:18:59,100
Then you can accidentally toggle on and off and stream true

3960
05:19:02,140 --> 05:19:05,020
The only person who worries for receiving followers aim

3961
05:19:07,020 --> 05:19:14,060
Dr. Pepper taste dr. Pepper taste kind of cola with with mint mint mint fizzy juice

3962
05:19:14,860 --> 05:19:18,460
I'm not sure mint fizzy juice is gonna go down well with me. I do apologize

3963
05:19:26,540 --> 05:19:29,660
I just remembered i'm not sure another brazilian already took it first

3964
05:19:30,620 --> 05:19:34,460
So i'll do it myself come to brazil cutlass congrats. You're the first one to do it

3965
05:19:35,340 --> 05:19:37,340
Come to brazil

3966
05:19:37,420 --> 05:19:39,420
I don't think I know any

3967
05:19:41,260 --> 05:19:43,260
Plus so tell a bay

3968
05:19:44,460 --> 05:19:46,940
So so tell a bay is all I can say

3969
05:19:52,140 --> 05:19:55,900
I'm almost finished. I'm so sorry for those who are waiting on the gameplay

3970
05:19:57,340 --> 05:19:59,340
I think dr. Pepper tasted medicine

3971
05:20:00,220 --> 05:20:01,740
mint

3972
05:20:01,740 --> 05:20:05,260
Not like cinnamon. Sorry not ice cream soda just cream soda

3973
05:20:08,940 --> 05:20:10,940
Dr. Pepper's cherry cola

3974
05:20:14,060 --> 05:20:15,420
Hmm

3975
05:20:15,420 --> 05:20:22,060
The guys see the online discourse about the ingredients in like american food versus like any other country

3976
05:20:22,620 --> 05:20:24,620
And like so much stuff has been banned

3977
05:20:24,940 --> 05:20:26,940
Hmm

3978
05:20:28,460 --> 05:20:34,380
Hey, stroney, did you know that mint and spicy can be active at the same time in your mouth try it in your experience heck

3979
05:20:35,740 --> 05:20:37,740
Mint and spicy

3980
05:20:41,260 --> 05:20:46,940
I've never even thought of that. Yeah, that's never occurred. It's like spicy water

3981
05:20:48,700 --> 05:20:50,700
It'll be interesting to see what you actually enjoy

3982
05:20:51,180 --> 05:20:52,300
Hmm

3983
05:20:52,300 --> 05:20:54,780
I think that other drink was a and w

3984
05:20:55,980 --> 05:21:02,300
Root by air. I think I got like creamy. I think it was cream soda or creamy soda a root by air root by air

3985
05:21:03,420 --> 05:21:05,420
No, root by your root by air

3986
05:21:06,220 --> 05:21:10,300
McDonald's you can check for ingredients but don't you say 35 ingredients most of them are code numbers?

3987
05:21:11,340 --> 05:21:14,780
Oh, yeah, american drinks for instance. They often use high fructose corn syrup and

3988
05:21:15,340 --> 05:21:22,620
What happens if I ingest high fructose corn syrup die like explode? It's a dangerous

3989
05:21:30,700 --> 05:21:32,700
Hmm

3990
05:21:32,940 --> 05:21:34,940
No, kinder eggs

3991
05:21:35,180 --> 05:21:38,860
Actually, you know what's even sadder about the kinder egg ban the new realize

3992
05:21:39,500 --> 05:21:41,500
The only reason those children

3993
05:21:41,900 --> 05:21:48,220
Hmm past because of the kinder egg was because their parents weren't even paying attention to them

3994
05:21:48,860 --> 05:21:50,860
Which is such a wee shame like it's

3995
05:21:53,100 --> 05:21:55,100
Um

3996
05:21:57,900 --> 05:21:59,900
They have to ban it

3997
05:22:00,060 --> 05:22:05,580
Instead of being like hey here public announcement pay attention to your little ones because we didn't know

3998
05:22:06,140 --> 05:22:07,100
um

3999
05:22:07,100 --> 05:22:09,100
little ones explore

4000
05:22:09,660 --> 05:22:15,340
Using their mouth. That's why you can imagine literally licking any surface because you did it as a wee babby

4001
05:22:15,340 --> 05:22:18,140
It's an exploratory thing. You you learned so much from it

4002
05:22:19,420 --> 05:22:21,420
Like for example if I tell you

4003
05:22:22,140 --> 05:22:25,980
Uh to imagine what it's like licking a cold pole with rain

4004
05:22:27,260 --> 05:22:31,820
It's gonna sound i'm in danger. Why is it red? Why is it red? I saw that

4005
05:22:33,260 --> 05:22:35,900
I saw that I just entered combat there for a second

4006
05:22:36,700 --> 05:22:40,380
Monka is Monka is I saw that those like I'm not watching your game

4007
05:22:42,060 --> 05:22:44,060
um

4008
05:22:44,380 --> 05:22:48,300
My HUD went red. I I'm covering up the HUD like with my big hair

4009
05:22:48,700 --> 05:22:53,260
But it went red which meant I was under attack there. So I don't know what just happened

4010
05:22:58,620 --> 05:23:02,700
The kinder the American kinder egg man is real if I was a mean no I feel

4011
05:23:06,620 --> 05:23:08,620
Oh

4012
05:23:10,380 --> 05:23:13,180
Is that also why there's no toys in the cereal and everyone thought about that

4013
05:23:20,860 --> 05:23:22,860
I'll flew into my cross here. Mm-hmm

4014
05:23:27,740 --> 05:23:29,740
Okay, last bite

4015
05:23:29,820 --> 05:23:33,900
Last bite. I'm gonna go get a cola. Actually, I wouldn't mind a cola after that

4016
05:23:33,900 --> 05:23:38,780
Just to really really make sure my health was really bad. Uh, mcdonald's on a cola. Why not?

4017
05:23:41,180 --> 05:23:43,180
I won't make

4018
05:24:04,540 --> 05:24:08,300
I'm so true that's a oh my god my headset

4019
05:24:10,540 --> 05:24:14,700
My headset just moved in a flinch. I don't think I was getting attacked in real life

4020
05:24:16,220 --> 05:24:18,220
Yes, I was

4021
05:24:19,340 --> 05:24:21,740
I'm farming the dump it on this one

4022
05:24:23,660 --> 05:24:26,060
I ain't swallowed this before I choke. Hold on a minute

4023
05:24:26,780 --> 05:24:28,780
Oh

4024
05:24:29,820 --> 05:24:35,100
Okay, cola time have a little sip of cola with the edge. I'll try and have a little bit more of that milkshake

4025
05:24:38,380 --> 05:24:40,380
Yucky milkshake

4026
05:24:44,380 --> 05:24:49,980
Right, I've probably got a big burp generator eaten because I've just eaten so I do apologize unless you want me to get out of the way in there

4027
05:24:50,860 --> 05:24:54,540
Mm-hmm, so I can have a sip you absolutely can't have a sip of the cola

4028
05:24:57,020 --> 05:24:59,420
Oh, so how's the Nutella seen in your countries?

4029
05:25:00,780 --> 05:25:02,780
Uh as Nutella

4030
05:25:03,980 --> 05:25:09,900
Although I know in the Belgium they have these like adorable little self-serve size Nutella

4031
05:25:11,500 --> 05:25:15,820
I don't know where the burp is it's hiding in me, right? Right. I'm a big girl

4032
05:25:16,780 --> 05:25:20,060
I'm a big girl. I can just ignore literally everything

4033
05:25:21,820 --> 05:25:26,780
Nutella is on a cracker honestly. Oh, there we go. It's all coming up now

Okay, there we go. No, they're never in it right. I'm not running off the map this time

Banshee's been killed by men, but thanks for the company

She's fueled up better firing circuits are fried because everyone's giving it such a terrible review

4058
05:27:17,180 --> 05:27:20,220
I'm like, I don't really want to spend money on it just to like have a wee dip

4059
05:27:20,860 --> 05:27:24,780
Look around they destroy my paper. You don't have to tell me

4060

That's the weird. Oh, that's the weird thing because you are okay. You're timing the blush or something. Hmm

We were discussing should we have p.o boxes

4069
05:28:09,660 --> 05:28:12,940
But I said to the girl like it's just far too dangerous on this day and age

4070
05:28:13,260 --> 05:28:15,900
Like with trackers and stuff and there's been so many streamers

4071
05:28:16,540 --> 05:28:18,540

4084
05:29:27,740 --> 05:29:29,740

Right, am I safe? No, please. Can I enter the cutscene or am I about to get like absolutely mugged in the cutscene?

4104
05:31:08,140 --> 05:31:10,140
Give me

4105
05:31:10,140 --> 05:31:12,140
No wonder only two people have played this

4106
05:31:12,540 --> 05:31:16,940
That should clear up the skies and help Kendra. Hey, you've got to help naga this. Where are you going?

4107
05:31:17,420 --> 05:31:19,420

Wait unlock again. Is this like super easy to level up as an rda?

4113
05:31:35,900 --> 05:31:37,900
Hmm

4114
05:31:38,300 --> 05:31:40,300

4115
05:31:40,300 --> 05:31:42,300

4123
05:32:09,580 --> 05:32:11,580

05:32:13,580 --> 05:32:16,700
Pandora like super strong and I whoa, whoa, whoa

4125
05:32:18,060 --> 05:32:20,060
Can I like shoot that one from here?

4126
05:32:21,340 --> 05:32:25,900
This is awful. I'm so sorry the controls are not like straightforward with this

4127
05:32:28,380 --> 05:32:33,660
I'm just trying to see it back in the spray. No, I'm not hitting. Oh, this is terrible

4128
05:32:34,540 --> 05:32:37,100
Close your eyes. Don't look mercy. Don't look you're gonna vomit

4129
05:32:37,980 --> 05:32:41,340
I don't really want to get hurt by that, but I think I'm gonna have to

4130
05:32:44,300 --> 05:32:49,500
Oh, I'm out of like the render distance for it, but there we go. Oh

4131
05:32:50,780 --> 05:32:52,780
Where's the next one?

4132
05:32:53,420 --> 05:32:57,260
Wait, there's one behind me apparently it's right behind me. Uh, no

4133
05:32:58,300 --> 05:33:02,700
We're oh, whoa. Whoa easy easy easy easy. Oh

4134
05:33:03,820 --> 05:33:06,460
Wait, so I can like actually die in these choppers

4135
05:33:08,060 --> 05:33:10,060
Oh my god

4136
05:33:10,860 --> 05:33:13,420
Oh, did I do it? No, I got you now

4137
05:33:14,460 --> 05:33:16,460
Where's the Dancino?

4138
05:33:17,100 --> 05:33:20,140
Get me out of this like right now. Seriously

4139
05:33:21,340 --> 05:33:26,940
Go up and then go forward a bit and up and forward and up and forward and up and forward right just up

4140
05:33:27,740 --> 05:33:29,740
And then we'll go just forward. Okay

4141
05:33:30,940 --> 05:33:36,540
Easy easy on the tilt. Why are you it's literally tilting me? I don't know why insist on tilting

4142
05:33:38,060 --> 05:33:44,540
Squishy human versus navi with their carbon fiber reinforced bones. Honestly. Oh my god. I just missed the helipad as well

4143
05:33:45,420 --> 05:33:49,660
Oh, let me sit then get get me out of that. I'm gonna vomit if I'm in that any longer

4144
05:33:50,540 --> 05:33:54,780
You guys can deal with the freaking bad guys because I'm just absolutely rubbish. Get me inside

4145
05:33:55,660 --> 05:33:59,260
You have rockets. Oh, I didn't know. Okay. That might be a bit easier

4146
05:34:00,620 --> 05:34:03,340
I'm holding on good girl. Wait. Why are we thinking?

4147
05:34:07,260 --> 05:34:09,500
Must be because everything wants to hurt you here

4148
05:34:12,620 --> 05:34:14,620
Wounded our inbound

4149
05:34:19,420 --> 05:34:24,060
How's the game so far we've completed the navi and we're doing the bad bad human side now

4150
05:34:24,460 --> 05:34:29,260
I'm going to keep this simple, but I don't know what to expect. I'm pretty scared of that because I've never played this side

4151
05:34:30,460 --> 05:34:33,340
This project starts with you our signal specialist

4152
05:34:34,300 --> 05:34:38,060
This is the sector you're currently in. We need you to go to these three ports

4153
05:34:38,860 --> 05:34:43,820
Once there you must collect small shards of unobtainment. Oh, right. So we're literally doing

4154
05:34:45,020 --> 05:34:47,020
Directly the opposite. I mean that makes sense

4155
05:34:49,340 --> 05:34:56,300
But right now just get those three unobtainium shards. Don't worry too much about the details, writer. We don't have a lot of time

4156
05:34:57,180 --> 05:34:59,180
Okay

4157
05:34:59,980 --> 05:35:01,980
Good Falco out. You heard the man

4158
05:35:03,500 --> 05:35:04,700
Oh

4159
05:35:04,700 --> 05:35:07,260
Okay. Yeah, I have a few questions. All right. I'm out

4160
05:35:08,300 --> 05:35:15,260
Uh, honestly, I'm like leveling up so much. I don't know I can call in I've got weapons up for it as well

4161
05:35:17,740 --> 05:35:19,740
It's trying to hate humans

4162
05:35:24,380 --> 05:35:26,380
We are not humans

4163
05:35:26,780 --> 05:35:29,260
And you make it a lot harder for yourself than it has to be

4164
05:35:29,820 --> 05:35:30,860
Hey

4165
05:35:30,860 --> 05:35:37,020
Look, I'm no very smart. Okay. All right. I think that one will have full health. Where am I? Am I flying? Oh, I'm it's a flying

4166
05:35:38,220 --> 05:35:45,180
That has to be flying. There's no way I can do that on foot. Sorry. There's no way right. Who's ready to get motion sick me?

4167
05:35:47,340 --> 05:35:52,460
Okay, let's first turn to the first wait woman's closest. Yeah, that one is closest

4168
05:35:53,340 --> 05:35:57,900
Okay, first let's get hate so we don't bump into the walls or anything

4169
05:35:58,860 --> 05:36:02,780
Is this the ceiling of the game is wow, we're already at the ceiling. Okay, uh

4170
05:36:04,220 --> 05:36:07,500
Sorry ceiling of the map. My apologies. Hold on

4171
05:36:09,740 --> 05:36:12,940
Whoa, this is like humongous. What? Um

4172
05:36:15,660 --> 05:36:19,900
Oh my god, this is so much harder than driving an ikaran

4173
05:36:20,060 --> 05:36:22,060
Am I looking for

4174
05:36:24,860 --> 05:36:29,260
We're dead plant we're dead part. You know, don't you guys don't have a helipad here?

4175
05:36:30,300 --> 05:36:33,900
Oh, there's navi down there. Oh, I'm gonna get rolled by them. Hold on wait

4176
05:36:33,900 --> 05:36:39,260
I can see transport over here, which makes me think it's safe to put down the chopper here

4177
05:36:40,140 --> 05:36:46,380
I don't know if that's true, but we'll try it. Oh my god. We're about to go against navi for the first

4178
05:36:47,020 --> 05:36:49,020
Oh my god, that's horrifying

4179
05:36:50,380 --> 05:36:52,380
Oh my god

4180
05:36:52,380 --> 05:36:54,380
That's horrifying

4181
05:36:54,700 --> 05:37:01,180
Oh, I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like it. I don't like it. They're so big

4182
05:37:02,540 --> 05:37:04,540
They're genuinely so big

4183
05:37:08,060 --> 05:37:12,860
Oh my god, I don't know what to do. Is this a sniper shot?

4184
05:37:14,140 --> 05:37:16,940
No, this is a shotgun. Oh my god

4185
05:37:17,180 --> 05:37:19,180
Okay, it's a shotgun

4186

Okay, I'm a big girl. I'm a big girl. I can do it

4189
05:37:37,020 --> 05:37:39,020
Okay, it's fine

4190
05:37:40,940 --> 05:37:42,940

4256
05:45:26,100 --> 05:45:31,220
of the four shard collection missions I assume it's just gonna copy the

4257
05:45:31,220 --> 05:45:38,980
previous tactics hi hi in me currently in a horror game right now awful it's

4258
05:45:38,980 --> 05:45:46,460
terrible oh we did homework and brushed teeth oh did you actually we're

4259

brushing her teeth too is this gonna be another 12 hour stream no it's gonna be

4260
05:45:53,740 --> 05:45:59,900
eight hours if I don't die too much I have successfully completed the Navi

4261
05:45:59,900 --> 05:46:04,140
storyline in this game I'm having to go below because the map isn't letting me

4262
05:46:04,140 --> 05:46:08,100
go above is this a dead end

4263
05:46:09,100 --> 05:46:20,140
I'm not safe anywhere genuinely not safe anywhere how do I do my bombs I don't

4264
05:46:20,140 --> 05:46:28,980
know how to do bombs you say I have bombs but nothing oh whoa I do have bombs

4265

4267
05:46:44,420 --> 05:46:50,020
everywhere I can't believe it there's people everywhere that look here all

4268
05:46:50,020 --> 05:46:55,180
these controls are awful I missed the Falcon from Halo and literally I'm

4275
05:47:34,500 --> 05:47:38,460

4276
05:47:38,460 --> 05:47:44,020
we can't see it my big heads covering up just just freaking get out of this

hello writer you brought actually don't know the let's get start the dialogue

4317
05:52:45,420 --> 05:52:51,220
still got some time before the emulators up and running the emulator you don't know

4318
05:52:51,220 --> 05:52:56,220
yet all in good time right now we need to upload that harmonic pop it into the

4319
05:52:56,220 --> 05:53:05,180
module and let's see what we've got okay sure here we go what's happening now what's

4320
05:53:05,180 --> 05:53:10,420
all this stuff for doc yes let me explain the knobby have a unique relationship with

4321
05:53:10,420 --> 05:53:16,660
the plan using a sacred site they're able to link directly with the ecosystem it's

4322
05:53:16,660 --> 05:53:21,100
how they communicate with the entire so we're searching for something different

4323
05:53:21,100 --> 05:53:26,540
our research there is another site that can help us sever the knobby community

4324
05:53:26,540 --> 05:53:35,020
con already has my joy stick place the knobby call the well if we can find this

4325
05:53:35,020 --> 05:53:38,540
old this is why they aren't letting you name any more car honestly I know as a

4326
05:53:39,260 --> 05:53:46,900
I'll never live down from the liberal but honestly best name this is where your harmonics

4327
05:53:46,900 --> 05:53:52,580
come in right we don't know where this dormant site is hi so the harmonic helps you find its

4328
05:53:52,580 --> 05:53:57,460
location I'm actually enjoying these cutscenes because I've never seen them before we can

4329
05:53:57,460 --> 05:54:03,060
triangulate the precise location of the dormant well of soul okay now let's see what your first

4330
05:54:03,060 --> 05:54:05,060
harmonic shows

4331
05:54:07,500 --> 05:54:13,860
excellent did you notice the red dots no those are supposed to be a cutscene with each harmonic

4332
05:54:13,860 --> 05:54:20,260
will reduce the number of red dots cutscene cutscene docu will be our well of soul red dots docu

4333
05:54:20,260 --> 05:54:27,340
you're up for this plan indeed now it's time to check in with commander falco for your next mission

4334
05:54:34,060 --> 05:54:40,060
okay I've got your next mission on deck

4335
05:54:40,060 --> 05:54:46,060
officer midori will meet you fever a new area they really didn't recycle any of the

4336
05:54:46,060 --> 05:54:51,660
map escort you ain't no plumber you'll be good with it and a score oh my god dug it help please

4337
05:54:51,660 --> 05:54:59,780
please dug it help of love uh we can partner in crime for those tree huggers are crying foul over

4338
05:54:59,780 --> 05:55:01,780
this emulator all worried about

4339
05:55:03,380 --> 05:55:09,940
Monroe mentioned that what is this emulator you stay focused on your mission writer you start

4340
05:55:09,940 --> 05:55:17,300
growing the conscience and you'll end up on the dead end of a knobby spear dismiss okay okay falcon

4341
05:55:17,300 --> 05:55:26,020
is your travel to fable hmm that's where they made different maps reach when I genuinely assumed

4342
05:55:26,020 --> 05:55:32,740
it was just gonna be recycled I can't believe it I'm surprised but we've picked up one song so we need

4343
05:55:33,540 --> 05:55:38,980
two more songs and then I assume the third we destroy it or the navi destroy it before we get

4344
05:55:38,980 --> 05:55:47,220
it so it's like literally a complete hundred I could flip yeah words and stuff um hello please

4345
05:55:47,300 --> 05:55:54,340
fly me to the flea ball let's hit the envelope just promise me no power she really said no

4346
05:55:54,340 --> 05:56:03,780
projectile woman the fever I feel like I'm gonna be even more scared

4347
05:56:05,940 --> 05:56:09,700
are you disappointed that they didn't reuse assets since you know the RDA

4348
05:56:10,660 --> 05:56:17,220
period now I'm just a surprise like I just assumed the opposite was going to be the same

4349
05:56:17,220 --> 05:56:24,100
maps but we're attacking from a different side but just watch yourself out there I'll drop you

4350
05:56:24,100 --> 05:56:28,660
at the load with midoring I'm being so fuel I'll catch you on the other side

4351
05:56:32,260 --> 05:56:38,980
well back into the free let's unlock this teleport first and then get assigned or

4352
05:56:38,980 --> 05:56:44,100
quest from Kendra welcome to the fever you need to link up with our forward units

4353
05:56:44,100 --> 05:56:49,380
they've got orders to secure your shards be careful these guys are in that's what it was

4354
05:56:52,100 --> 05:56:55,140
I was I was wondering why the voice sense so familiar

4355
05:56:58,180 --> 05:57:00,980
kind of sad they put so much effort into it didn't get much traction

4356
05:57:04,340 --> 05:57:07,780
I think in 2.7 million sales you made your money back though

4357
05:57:09,380 --> 05:57:17,220
so investors can't feel too bad I think I don't know if like avatar because when the

4358
05:57:17,220 --> 05:57:23,060
movie came out it was like this big unexpected hit like no one expected it how do I

4359
05:57:24,740 --> 05:57:27,860
motion sick buggy okay warning for motion sick people

4360
05:57:28,660 --> 05:57:35,620

06:02:50,900 --> 06:03:00,180

this is like really uh whoa no I pressed get me on that leaf get me on it

4405

4425
06:05:45,140 --> 06:05:50,740
merci modis is going live in t-minus three hours at the moment we are playing a game known as

4426
06:05:50,740 --> 06:05:56,180
James Cameron's avatar which is childhood game of mine we have finished the navi quest line and now

4427
06:05:56,180 --> 06:06:02,500
we are playing as the bad guys I am absolutely terrified of genuinely fighting the um

4428
06:06:02,980 --> 06:06:13,540
the navi um so we are just trying our best to get through the quest line as fast as possible

4429
06:06:13,540 --> 06:06:22,260
with the least amount of spikes as possible and the game has aged a little bit in terms of like

4430
06:06:22,260 --> 06:06:26,180
I don't know what they were thinking these camera angles and stuff why does that look like it's

4431
06:06:26,180 --> 06:06:31,780
gonna wallop down on me as I go past it I saw that I can that is horrific I've not seen that

4432
06:06:32,900 --> 06:06:37,380
oh there's noises being made oh there's navi standing up okay that's why that's why

4433
06:06:39,060 --> 06:06:45,060
we're just gonna keep driving to objective and everything's gonna be all right and we're

4434
06:06:45,060 --> 06:06:51,860
totally not playing horror game simulator at all honestly this is terrifying as a human oh please

4435
06:06:51,860 --> 06:06:59,540
let me roll you over please don't get back up again oh please mr rocks don't ruin this I don't

4450
06:08:35,780 --> 06:08:40,900
and I am absolutely terrified every time I go against the navi because they are so tall and

4451
06:08:40,900 --> 06:08:48,900
lanky and scary and their arms are so long and whoa getting shivers just right we've got

4452
06:08:48,900 --> 06:08:54,340
we need one more crystal from this map and then we can already move on out here thanks for your

4455
06:09:05,300 --> 06:09:14,500
this game actually looks well made for a movie I don't want to really write that that's literally

4456
06:09:14,500 --> 06:09:19,780
gonna oh my god but to take all of that on foot with all the navi is terrifying

4457
06:09:27,140 --> 06:09:33,780
can I repair it you know get like a little bit oh is it stuck okay hold on I don't want to run

4458
06:09:33,780 --> 06:09:39,620

4459
06:09:40,420 --> 06:09:45,380
this thing is gonna explode the moment I encounter a navi I just don't know it okay I'm already

4460
06:09:45,380 --> 06:09:52,180
right hold on hold on hold on this is not gonna go well I can already see myself perishing and

4461
06:09:52,180 --> 06:09:57,380
like five seconds flat this is just the camera angle why did they find a light

4462
06:09:57,460 --> 06:10:03,700
I was not even like explode out just perish

4463
06:10:05,620 --> 06:10:12,580
well let's not do that again I guess so I have to do this on foot and be absolutely mortified

4464
06:10:12,580 --> 06:10:17,620
the entire time let me put on the protection spell that was the dumbest thing I've ever seen

4465
06:10:17,620 --> 06:10:24,820
don't ever do that again where is it protection right so I have speed protection health and blend

4466
06:10:27,460 --> 06:10:35,620
I can do it I'm big girl I'm already level three on the abilities so they're actually gonna last

4467
06:10:35,620 --> 06:10:47,700
quite a long time right that's okay that's okay I'm a big girl and this isn't scary to me at all

4468
06:10:47,700 --> 06:10:54,900
I'm not absolutely terrified and there's not a bit of pee ready to come flying out of me once I get

4469
06:10:54,900 --> 06:11:03,940
jump scared we're cutting it we're cutting it short we are cutting it short I have to admit

4470
06:11:03,940 --> 06:11:11,940
this thing's about to unclog okay that's fine it's just plants plants are allowed to expel that

4471
06:11:11,940 --> 06:11:16,900
thing I don't know what the heck it does I feel like it's gonna slam down on me and I just want to

4472
06:11:16,980 --> 06:11:17,860
confirm or deny

4473
06:11:22,980 --> 06:11:24,980

no way that's so silly I know how to farm now

4475
06:11:31,220 --> 06:11:36,420
eh right we just need to go in this uncharted territory I'm sure it'll be fine and there's

4476
06:11:36,420 --> 06:11:46,180
not tons of navi ahead I'll need these don't raid a flaming cart I think it's okay it's okay

4477
06:11:47,220 --> 06:12:02,980
okay this is gonna last a good cheeky 10 seconds five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 maybe 50

4485
06:13:00,580 --> 06:13:05,780

4486
06:13:06,340 --> 06:13:06,900
level up

4487
06:13:10,340 --> 06:13:14,340
if that hammerhead taught us anything is that you ain't got enough damage for bosses

4488
06:13:14,340 --> 06:13:23,780
monkey ass are you implying there's a boss ahead monkey ass because I I don't I don't know

4495
06:14:05,140 --> 06:14:09,860

4496
06:14:10,660 --> 06:14:15,860
what does monkey ass mean it's a twitch emote where you look really stressed out and like oh no

4497

06:14:23,060 --> 06:14:29,860
oh my god why is it such a horror ambience I'm not even being funny

4502
06:14:48,660 --> 06:14:57,700
this I cannot wait to get through this and let it be over because this is just

4503
06:14:59,060 --> 06:15:07,220
this is too much for my little heart I can hardly take a desert guy they perish oh my yeah this is

4504
06:15:07,460 --> 06:15:09,460

4505
06:15:13,460 --> 06:15:16,340

4506
06:15:18,260 --> 06:15:22,180

oh forget it we hate nature literally what

4510
06:15:43,380 --> 06:15:47,700
it seems like there's more soldiers placed everywhere though maybe to help you through it

4511
06:15:47,700 --> 06:15:52,740
just because they know they made it a bit harder with the plant and the wildlife and the navi

4512
06:15:52,740 --> 06:15:58,100
ganging up on you at least like when you're navi only a little bit of the wildlife gang up on you

4513
06:15:58,100 --> 06:16:06,900
and that oh yeah I would definitely need the frickin oh my is that friendly bombs

06:19:54,340 --> 06:19:58,500
I'm just gonna let them attack and hope they don't keep respawning

4546
06:20:00,820 --> 06:20:10,180
and then it's safe to come out okay okay okay now hold on hold on all is not lost this might not

4547
06:20:10,180 --> 06:20:17,220
be the most painful gameplay of rda side you've ever seen it's called tools pa

4548
06:20:24,020 --> 06:20:25,860
the wildlife cannot

4549
06:20:28,820 --> 06:20:30,420
okay hold on hold on hold on

4550
06:20:32,900 --> 06:20:37,540

4553
06:20:54,100 --> 06:21:00,820

4554
06:21:00,820 --> 06:21:08,820
exp or something can I like crush them with a mech no I can't that's interesting oh no is that

4574
06:23:28,580 --> 06:23:31,700

06:37:52,020 --> 06:37:57,380
to invite scientists for questioning I'm not sure what he's nervous about we need to be careful

4694
06:37:58,100 --> 06:38:06,820
if the time comes we may need to make some tough choices so Kendra wants you to report to Monroe

4695
06:38:06,820 --> 06:38:12,820
at hell's gate if you're gonna give me 8000 xp for showing up sure I'll go to hell's gate pretty

4696
06:38:12,820 --> 06:38:20,340
sure there are lots of sections of everything in vampires the masquerade and destroy all humans

4697
06:38:20,340 --> 06:38:27,380
have hypnosis wait vampires masquerade do you get to play as a vampire that hypnotizes people that

4698
06:38:27,380 --> 06:38:35,460
would be kind of cool oh my god I'm here for that oh okay I feel like we level up so fast

4699
06:38:35,460 --> 06:38:43,460
this rda maybe the rda isn't as long I think so oh that's so cool maybe we'll take a look at that

4700
06:38:43,460 --> 06:38:49,700
I've never played it or seen any gameplay of it but uh is that like a highly rated game

4701
06:38:52,020 --> 06:38:59,860
dark souls 3 has rapport for anime potential I suppose I mean technically more door shadow

4702
06:38:59,860 --> 06:39:06,980
and more door you can take technically like imprint enemies so they're not mean to you all right

4703
06:39:06,980 --> 06:39:11,860
upload the harmonic I'm behind on my doomsday diagnostic this is the second song wrong with the

4704
06:39:11,860 --> 06:39:17,860
emulator we could have an ecological meltdown okay let's hold up a sec what the hell is this emulator

4705
06:39:19,060 --> 06:39:24,580
yes the emulator we're searching for a dormant well of souls right now once we find it we need to

4706
06:39:24,580 --> 06:39:31,460
communicate oh they're pretending being called a first voice he's the only person who can awake

4707
06:39:31,460 --> 06:39:40,180
in a well of souls they're pretending that the emulator isn't just a nuke once that's done

4708
06:39:40,260 --> 06:39:46,820
we can control the entire ecosystem so back to that first ecosystem you're going to do a diagnostic

4709
06:39:47,620 --> 06:39:53,700
well hey everything has its risk come now upload that harm they're lying to me not

4710
06:39:55,220 --> 06:39:59,620
but we're still going to nuke the planet anyway once they're closer depending on the location of

4711
06:39:59,620 --> 06:40:04,500
the dormant site you should check in with the man who doesn't in fact have the option to be a hypnotic

4712
06:40:05,460 --> 06:40:09,620
and highly rated as a question it's a cult classic oh my apology I did not know that

4713
06:40:14,900 --> 06:40:21,540
it's good might need to mess with it a little to make it work though it's an old game oh yeah

4714
06:40:21,540 --> 06:40:26,740
doesn't Baldur's Gate have a bunch of them I'm not playing Big Baldi's Gate yet

4715
06:40:27,220 --> 06:40:32,500
scenario don't start growing a brain it says it's corp is it like corp that can bring you get

4716
06:40:32,500 --> 06:40:38,500
you guys in and out or is it another kind of corp the human colony and avatar is pretty impressive

4717
06:40:38,820 --> 06:40:43,540
that emulators are one hope Baldur's Gate has tons of main controls especially because main

4718
06:40:43,540 --> 06:40:48,980
flyers are a big part of the plot hmm doesn't have main control of the game

4719
06:40:50,580 --> 06:40:57,940
it's quite a vtm vampire's masquerades old game it's not that kind of cool one we're going to

4720
06:40:57,940 --> 06:41:08,020
Graves Bog okay did you know that in scots the bog is slang for the toilet did you know that in

4721
06:41:08,020 --> 06:41:14,740
Australia the thunderbox is slang for the toilet I don't know what any slang for any other

4722
06:41:16,900 --> 06:41:19,860

4724
06:41:25,940 --> 06:41:28,500

4809
06:50:50,980 --> 06:50:57,060
r.i.p. I can't believe it it's such a legendary game I can't even say I recommend like I'll go out and

4810
06:50:57,060 --> 06:51:02,900
buy it it's the experiences for me is more nostalgia although this part is like actually

4811
06:51:03,780 --> 06:51:06,740
like I'm actually like having a challenge playing this part

4812
06:51:08,500 --> 06:51:14,820
I'm still in disbelief the game even exists your hands are on the controller

4813
06:51:14,820 --> 06:51:19,380
be like didn't sell the third oh the jet didn't see the turret sorry it's on

4814

4815
06:51:33,860 --> 06:51:38,580
I'm sure by the way you missed the cutscene gate flying like a rocket launcher honestly

4816
06:51:39,860 --> 06:51:47,060
yeah you leveled so far I wonder if the rda mission is actually like smaller than the main

4817
06:51:48,580 --> 06:51:55,220
wait I want to unlock the fast travel before takeoff just in case level up

4818

4826
06:52:45,860 --> 06:52:50,500

06:53:00,660 --> 06:53:04,500
oh that's like just a little deafening

4829
06:53:06,500 --> 06:53:09,860
okay this just looks like an XP farm run I'm gonna say it but

4830
06:53:11,700 --> 06:53:13,940
I can't even see what's ahead of me there's so much

4837
06:54:07,380 --> 06:54:11,700
this is just annihilation I'm starting to feel bad for the navi like as much as they're annoying

4838
06:54:11,700 --> 06:54:14,900
when they're trying to kill me damn it engine won't start

4839
06:54:15,620 --> 06:54:26,180
oh as they hold them off where I can't see oh god they're everywhere

4840
06:54:33,540 --> 06:54:35,300
oh I don't know if I'm going to make this alive

06:54:40,020 --> 06:54:43,300
hard

4843
06:54:47,460 --> 06:54:49,460
oh my goodness

4844
06:54:50,980 --> 06:54:56,820
can I see oh it's a blue plan I keep thinking it's a navi it's a blue plan

4845
06:54:59,940 --> 06:55:07,060
come on start the car there's only so much back and forth I can do before we actually perish

4846
06:55:07,140 --> 06:55:07,620
seriously

4847
06:55:10,020 --> 06:55:12,900
oh my goodness right it seems like they're just falling back and

4848
06:55:13,540 --> 06:55:15,380
thank good right don't do that again

4849
06:55:19,220 --> 06:55:22,260
I'm sorry I yelled at you sweetheart he says to the car

4850
06:55:24,980 --> 06:55:27,380
reflinges I'm sorry I yelled at you sweetheart

4851
06:55:28,900 --> 06:55:32,660
I just get stressed when I'm playing the bad guys and everything's all skewed

4852
06:55:32,660 --> 06:55:34,900
and I'm sorry if I skewed

4853
06:55:42,340 --> 06:55:43,700
oh I don't want that to break

4854
06:55:46,900 --> 06:55:48,420
she's doing her best for humanity

4855
06:55:50,500 --> 06:55:55,060
absolutely denying it denying it sorry destroying it

4856
06:55:58,980 --> 06:56:00,180
if I'm getting xp

4857
06:56:03,060 --> 06:56:06,900
the first things are running away

4858
06:56:12,580 --> 06:56:16,820
that's my car that's small that's one of more guys my oh I even know

4859
06:56:19,700 --> 06:56:25,860
oh first things I just feel bad I feel like we're we're entering a zoo and then just executing

4860
06:56:25,860 --> 06:56:31,460
all the animals inside the zoo this is what this run feels like honestly

4861
06:56:33,220 --> 06:56:34,980
like they're literally running away now

4862
06:56:41,060 --> 06:56:43,940
oh for xp so I can unlock a new armor why not

4863
06:56:50,100 --> 06:56:51,220
perish that plan

4864
06:56:53,380 --> 06:56:54,740
in front are you don't oh

4865
06:56:57,540 --> 06:56:58,580
is that supposed to happen

4866
06:57:02,900 --> 06:57:08,660
what a unique game mode to say the least I think you see about three of these guys

4867
06:57:08,660 --> 06:57:13,620
if you play navi and you see 100 on this one section of the game alone

4868
06:57:19,540 --> 06:57:21,300
we're strum beast pulling

4869
06:57:23,140 --> 06:57:26,100
it's what it's been oh my god that was

4870
06:57:28,020 --> 06:57:32,020
that was a slaughter I'm not even happy with that that was awful

4871
06:57:32,820 --> 06:57:39,300
you're a lifesaver you're a lifesaver how about that strike stubby stakes all around okay the

4872
06:57:39,300 --> 06:57:45,540
second shards right in this sector go grab it and report back to me and the third I'm working on it

4873
06:57:45,540 --> 06:57:50,260
radios are toast everything slower here this is why the navi section has so few human

4874
06:57:51,140 --> 06:57:59,940
campaign colors them now you know why you don't see them in this oh is it like all this damage

4875
06:57:59,940 --> 06:58:02,900
has been done and we're just coming at the back end of it

4876
06:58:05,220 --> 06:58:08,260
oh that actually makes so much sense

4877
06:58:11,460 --> 06:58:16,260
and we're basic we basically come in when they're like at the end of the losing fight and we turn

4878
06:58:16,260 --> 06:58:28,260
the tide okay oh my god that's so smart I didn't give the devs team like as much benefit as a doubt

4879
06:58:28,340 --> 06:58:29,220
but that's so smart

4880
06:58:32,420 --> 06:58:36,660
don't let him I was gonna say don't let him kill you because he's gonna aggro to me and I can just tell

4881
06:58:36,660 --> 06:58:42,020
you is oh wait hold on where I'm trying to go hold on a minute let me pick

4882
06:58:43,860 --> 06:58:50,900
there we go I'll just let him get in the back thing what new drift would be got um wait I think

4883
06:58:50,900 --> 06:58:54,820
we're about to unlock the new one because now our arms are on show and I'm like that's the opposite

4884
06:58:54,820 --> 06:59:01,540
of what our it does the hero maybe oh no clue if it's kind of it's just a joke of mine I mean it

4885
06:59:01,540 --> 06:59:09,540
maybe because literally you only see two of them right where we need to go well I'm taking a car

4886
06:59:09,540 --> 06:59:19,860
for that I'm not taking that back thing can I drive this oh can draw how do I shoot I don't know

4887
06:59:19,940 --> 06:59:25,940
can I drive him over oh that was I was actually really mean I shouldn't have come up I kind of

4888
06:59:25,940 --> 06:59:30,420
deserved it what are all those things are those reports

4889
06:59:32,980 --> 06:59:40,660
um so can I not shoot I don't think I can I think I can only drive we're driving this buggy

4890
06:59:41,220 --> 06:59:46,980
oh that's like such a long way to go I'll go on the outskirts to get the

4891
06:59:49,860 --> 06:59:55,060
uh like uncovered map thing actually smash them against the wall

4892
06:59:56,900 --> 06:59:59,620
oh I can't go that way

4893
07:00:02,020 --> 07:00:07,540
this is so much more responsive than the buggy I have to admit I like that they make that differentiation

4894
07:00:11,220 --> 07:00:18,500
uh okay we can't go this way I thought we couldn't come through the way the map made it look but we

4895
07:00:19,380 --> 07:00:32,980
no I did not just do that oh I did not just do that oh I freaking did oh no no no hello game oh my gosh

4896
07:00:33,380 --> 07:00:40,340
oh this is the worst thing that could have happened has not happened

4897
07:00:41,700 --> 07:00:48,500
door stuck literally door stuck oh and I have to do all of this on foot whilst everything is aggressive

4898
07:00:48,500 --> 07:00:54,900
to me right how much further do I have to go just a wee bit for it just down the street

4899
07:00:54,900 --> 07:00:59,300
it's fine I just need to pop down the street it's like going to the corner shop it's just around

4900
07:00:59,380 --> 07:01:06,980
the corner it's okay you can just teleport down I can't because I've not unlocked whatever it is

4901
07:01:06,980 --> 07:01:15,780
it's not unlocked is it quiet is it safe question mark other than the fly trap

4902
07:01:17,380 --> 07:01:23,860
just a wee bit more all is good this is called sniper's point implying that they're

4903
07:01:23,860 --> 07:01:32,180
sniper navi looking at me right now question mark the ho hum okay whoa whoa whoa something's

4904
07:01:32,180 --> 07:01:40,500
getting me I don't want a fly a fly got me a mosquito a mosquito got me oh whoa look at it freaking

4905
07:01:40,500 --> 07:01:47,700
ready to like get me all right I'll wait until my inverse comes back yeah yeah that's right go

4906
07:01:47,700 --> 07:01:55,060
back to sleep give me a stinky stinky plant don't like you abandoned rda camp well that doesn't

4907
07:01:55,700 --> 07:02:01,780
that doesn't this is this this is not good for me I can tell you that much this is absolutely

4908
07:02:01,780 --> 07:02:07,940
awful for me um I will take the teleport point just so I don't have to do that again um

4909
07:02:08,740 --> 07:02:17,860
um can I hide here well he looks pretty enraged to me um

4910
07:02:20,420 --> 07:02:24,340
I have nowhere I'm gonna go up oh no I can't go up I'm too small

4911
07:02:26,660 --> 07:02:33,460
where where's the crystal guys I don't really want to go abandon hope yo you who may enter

4912
07:02:33,540 --> 07:02:40,580
on the floor finger it's about hole oh there's this to spray them down

4913
07:02:42,580 --> 07:02:45,220
hmm okay

4914
07:02:51,860 --> 07:02:53,380
did they just run away from me now

4915
07:02:54,260 --> 07:03:05,620
okay okay not too bad if I have a too little really destroy all this stuff too I mean it's

4916
07:03:05,620 --> 07:03:12,180
10 xp I'm not really sure it's worth taking the time to do that I will try and clear up this area

4917
07:03:12,180 --> 07:03:16,900
because if I'm to like try and find a crystal in the middle we're still free jumping I don't even know

4918
07:03:17,460 --> 07:03:19,460
what I'm supposed to look

4919
07:03:21,060 --> 07:03:26,660
oh now you come around the corner no you're such a liar you're actually such a liar you're telling

4920
07:03:26,660 --> 07:03:33,620
fivers why would you come around the corner now after I'd already sprayed you where on earth is this

4921
07:03:34,500 --> 07:03:40,900
thing and he's already AI locked on me I don't know why the game pretends otherwise

4922
07:03:41,780 --> 07:03:47,140
is there another turret over here that I can use I know the things back in that other section

4923
07:03:47,140 --> 07:03:54,260
I'm just wondering what's up here why is there a dead end oh and it's just like one of these things

4924
07:03:54,260 --> 07:04:02,100
jeez that gorilla and you're a lifesaver it's just abandon kind of showing you it's old

4925
07:04:02,100 --> 07:04:13,220
abandoned hope you know dog pet dog it's a turtle I have no idea with pecking crystals

4926
07:04:16,260 --> 07:04:23,220
already I go to me but I can't see maybe inside that building and that's why it's like flashing

4927
07:04:23,220 --> 07:04:27,220
here

4928
07:04:31,300 --> 07:04:32,020
oh pardon me

4929
07:04:35,060 --> 07:04:39,620
wait I'm gonna go invisible and see if I can shoot it from that turret or is it already

4930
07:04:39,620 --> 07:04:46,100
glued on to me no uh was it in here

4931
07:04:46,260 --> 07:04:52,740
bro where is this freaking cell sample I don't know

4932
07:04:54,820 --> 07:04:59,700
I'm gonna see if I can get rid of that last guy with us because he I just saw a second one

4933
07:05:01,700 --> 07:05:06,980
wait let's get rid of you because you're in my way you're in my way you're in my way

4934
07:05:07,860 --> 07:05:17,140

4935
07:05:26,820 --> 07:05:33,140
I hate you what even if you're invisible oh he's got protection prayer on I can see it that's what

4937
07:05:47,300 --> 07:05:49,620

4938
07:05:52,900 --> 07:05:55,620
that was big oh a different outfit I'm like

4939
07:05:56,180 --> 07:06:02,420
it's not that way it's out of bounds over there

4940
07:06:05,860 --> 07:06:12,420
it's not like up here whoa sorry sorry it wasn't paying attention is it off could it be on

4941
07:06:14,580 --> 07:06:17,380
where the heck is this one thing

4942
07:06:18,260 --> 07:06:24,420
no don't spray on me no it's not time for that

4943
07:06:28,660 --> 07:06:33,780
hello we're currently looking for something that my blind eyes cannot perceive

4944
07:06:37,700 --> 07:06:42,180
it says it's somewhere in this area and I keep perfectly avoiding it wherever it is

4945
07:06:43,140 --> 07:06:50,580
okay um now the avatars are coming in this area is it inside that maybe maybe it's inside

4946
07:06:50,580 --> 07:06:58,660
this one whatever it is it's in the building oh if it's in this one I'm gonna be mad because

4947
07:06:58,660 --> 07:07:04,180
I went in the other one oh for goodness gravy thank you what are the odds

4948
07:07:06,340 --> 07:07:10,900
right finally got there in the end and there of course there's not fast travel to that guy

4949
07:07:10,900 --> 07:07:12,180
because that would be too easy wouldn't that

4950
07:07:15,700 --> 07:07:19,860
uh that speed is fast though like I'm pretty speed

4951
07:07:21,860 --> 07:07:24,020
of course it was in the building that I wasn't looking at

4952
07:07:25,220 --> 07:07:28,500
how could I be such a silly sausage I was beating up my car

4953
07:07:30,740 --> 07:07:36,740
yeah I had to put a down payment on that right this is gonna be off topic I don't know if you

4954
07:07:36,740 --> 07:07:43,380
guys have been watching a there's this youtuber that looks at people's finances like for entertainment

4955
07:07:43,940 --> 07:07:50,340
but he always shouts at them for having a car and I didn't realize that a car loans were like

4956
07:07:50,340 --> 07:07:56,260
really predatory in America and where they like make you pay like a ridiculous like percentage

4957
07:07:56,260 --> 07:08:03,300
and stuff whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you just relax little flies you just relax thank you thank you

4963
07:08:32,900 --> 07:08:45,940
campaign unbelievably uh we are just going for it I love being ignored in battle yay I love going

4964
07:08:45,940 --> 07:08:55,460
so fast that the enemies don't target me yay I love not being a part of the fight ow he just spanked

4970
07:09:36,100 --> 07:09:42,660
boss fight but we can do it we can do it we can do it if we put our mind to uh we can do

4971
07:09:43,220 --> 07:09:46,260
we're um Eric I'm not trying to go I'm behind a tent right now

4972
07:09:48,100 --> 07:09:54,500
living up to the endurance streamer tag enemy yeah I wonder how many people

4973
07:09:55,300 --> 07:10:03,540
didn't realize like when I said endurance streamer I meant endurance strummer okay

4974
07:10:04,980 --> 07:10:08,500
right what am I doing just kind of kind of half follow the map

4975
07:10:09,460 --> 07:10:13,060
oh oh I'm in the battle field by accident

4976
07:10:17,060 --> 07:10:18,660
strummer look at his tail

4977
07:10:22,580 --> 07:10:24,820

07:10:26,660 --> 07:10:36,340
look at my speed my speed is amazing I'm a super soldier hmm it tastes like reasons

4979
07:10:38,900 --> 07:10:41,060
I was surprised but I haven't missed them how

4980
07:10:45,460 --> 07:10:51,140
I have streamed a heck of a lot of time I feel like maybe right or tan jala's been spotted near

4981
07:10:51,140 --> 07:10:56,100
the willow tree it's like he's waiting there waiting for you I think watch yourself

4982
07:11:00,740 --> 07:11:04,900
I can't even see the enemy you know that I actually can't eat I'm not being funny

4983
07:11:05,460 --> 07:11:10,980
I didn't mean to good battle but if I genuinely can't see the freaking enemy what are you wanting

4984
07:11:10,980 --> 07:11:19,460
me to do oh no way I've just engaged the freaking boss fight stop stop I've engaged the boss fight

4985
07:11:19,460 --> 07:11:27,940
and there's like a literally a billion you're gonna make me pay myself please oh my god I think I

4989
07:11:47,460 --> 07:11:53,780
out of mana when I'm running out of freaking strength potion as if we were playing rescape

4990
07:11:54,340 --> 07:12:02,900
right now oh my gosh what have I done what have I done what have I done I've just dived into the

4991
07:12:02,900 --> 07:12:09,860
enemy I like literally can't see them prep the time oh and there's someone sniping me from behind

4992
07:12:09,860 --> 07:12:17,780
as well not sorry but no it's just no on like you can't even just snake me from halfway across the

4993
07:12:17,780 --> 07:12:28,660
map and why did that one run away I have no idea I guess I'm at range whatever the sniper one is

4994
07:12:28,740 --> 07:12:35,060
still wound for me but at least that other one ran away okay that's the problem I have with the

4995
07:12:35,060 --> 07:12:42,500
snipers they can do that yes thank you for coming freaking point blank why oh wow Tanjala pushed me

4996
07:12:42,500 --> 07:12:52,020
so far out of his battle area he had literally DC no I can see that other NPC though can I shoot him

4997
07:12:52,820 --> 07:12:59,780
oh that's the flamethrower darling that's the shotgun can I I just want him there we go

4998
07:13:03,860 --> 07:13:06,500
I just wanted him to attack me no one else

4999
07:13:09,780 --> 07:13:16,340
okay let's let's take it nice and easy nice and easy she says that she gets caught in trees

5000
07:13:16,980 --> 07:13:23,860
no that no shotgun shotgun no no no no no no I missed okay this is what I want

5001
07:13:24,740 --> 07:13:31,700
the shotgun stagger is exactly what I'm looking for right now it can be what what's the name of

5002
07:13:31,700 --> 07:13:38,260
shotgun so it can be a spaz 12 is the name of a shotgun a stakeout is the name of a shotgun

5003
07:13:39,220 --> 07:13:44,180
oh they're gun I don't remember any other ones off the top of my head

5004
07:13:45,620 --> 07:13:49,140
not very good with gun names unless they're in black ops one and all on us too

5005
07:13:49,940 --> 07:14:04,340
like Famous AK-47 submachine guns Susie's AK-47 new um MP5 very classic normally shown in movies

5006
07:14:04,420 --> 07:14:11,700
mp5 k brian I have returned from the job strongy hope it's going well we're currently doing a

5007
07:14:11,700 --> 07:14:20,820
boss battle and I'm getting absolutely wrecked tiny spiny but I can only do as much as I can

5008
07:14:21,380 --> 07:14:27,380
it's taking a while I don't know I feel like maybe there's something I should know like maybe I

5009
07:14:27,380 --> 07:14:34,420
should be in a mech at this point it's very plausible um but thank you for the ship we're

5010
07:14:34,420 --> 07:14:40,980
getting there he's just cast protection sorry I like I don't want to waste the ammo since I've

5011
07:14:40,980 --> 07:14:48,500
a little bit too left like stop with the prayer protection whoa whoa whoa okay I'm out of that

5012
07:14:48,500 --> 07:14:54,180
so next is flamethrower we're just gonna no he gets so close when I do flamethrower like so close

5013
07:14:54,580 --> 07:15:02,100
is he got fury on so he does double damage to me I think so I think that's what that was

5014
07:15:03,700 --> 07:15:07,620
right we're just gonna have to do it seems he staggers with the assault right

5015
07:15:12,260 --> 07:15:13,940
I think he's got light machine gun actually

5016
07:15:14,740 --> 07:15:25,780
he's getting low so if he doesn't heal then I think we're in I think we're cooking by gas if he

5017
07:15:25,780 --> 07:15:36,340
doesn't heal oh okay we did it we did it we did it we did it I cast mystic barrier honestly

5043
07:18:28,180 --> 07:18:37,060
Sam um the hell divers like it was like people were they tried to make it so you had to have a

5044
07:18:37,060 --> 07:18:42,500
PSN account or something just to play the game even though they advertised like

5045
07:18:43,540 --> 07:18:46,740
you can still play your game even without the PSN part

5046
07:18:49,140 --> 07:18:50,100
when in doubt drink

5047
07:18:54,980 --> 07:19:00,420

5048
07:19:00,980 --> 07:19:05,780
things are turning nasty around here Falco said if the emulator didn't work perfectly

5049
07:19:06,340 --> 07:19:11,780
he put a bullet in my brain I doubt he was serious he was holding a gun to my head when

5051
07:19:23,540 --> 07:19:27,620
yeah they tried to force PSN accounts to play which would have blocked a lot of people out

5052
07:19:28,500 --> 07:19:30,820
and they're known for getting uh leaks

5053
07:19:37,460 --> 07:19:42,740

5142
07:30:42,660 --> 07:30:46,820

5145
07:31:03,540 --> 07:31:04,500
so many of them

5146
07:31:04,660 --> 07:31:06,660

5167
07:34:10,260 --> 07:34:11,460
I literally need to go down

5168
07:34:18,660 --> 07:34:26,580

5170
07:34:31,140 --> 07:34:38,580
bro I'm gonna explore the whole map before I actually get to my my location

5171
07:34:41,140 --> 07:34:41,780
I can't believe

5172
07:34:46,100 --> 07:34:51,540
explore the whole map I mean drowning people might have been a thing I've not done it yet

5173
07:34:51,540 --> 07:34:58,660
I'm not even being successful in doing my first hypnosis stream this is I'm getting absolutely

5174
07:34:59,220 --> 07:35:00,900
spun about in this game you know that

5175
07:35:02,820 --> 07:35:08,180
well I'm about to discover an outpost I don't know what's gonna happen when I get to it but

5176
07:35:09,700 --> 07:35:13,780
I literally discover the whole map before I get unlock the next objective

5177
07:35:17,300 --> 07:35:22,740
oh goodness me everything's abandoned and there's the name one I freaking saved me

5178
07:35:24,660 --> 07:35:25,940
so if I go down here

5179
07:35:28,900 --> 07:35:37,540

5180
07:35:43,620 --> 07:35:51,700
did I miss that please don't put me all the way back I have been traveling for a day and why would

5182
07:36:07,780 --> 07:36:13,700
getting the buggy we're driving because this is taking far too long to unlock the next objective

5183
07:36:13,700 --> 07:36:20,180
I don't know how I perish from that but what whatever right so that's a crossing right so

5184
07:36:21,700 --> 07:36:23,700

sounds like we've got company seems like we've got company

5212
07:39:37,220 --> 07:39:42,660
I don't like the sounds too many vital words it's going to be some way to slow them down

5213
07:39:42,660 --> 07:39:45,140
I'm on it it's got to be some way to slow them down

5214
07:39:46,660 --> 07:39:53,620
uh okay we're on your mark oh we're almost there hold on hold on for me you're so close

5215
07:39:53,620 --> 07:39:56,260

5216
07:39:58,180 --> 07:40:00,660

5217
07:40:04,020 --> 07:40:09,220
oh is that a bomb oh that's a bomb has to be bombed anyway me that's supposed to be bomb yeah

5218
07:40:12,900 --> 07:40:16,500
all right the bomb did activate even though I did it like that at the same time

5219
07:40:20,660 --> 07:40:23,540
okay okay just to do it one more time one more time

5220
07:40:29,060 --> 07:40:32,340
it's okay it's okay right they're both they're both

5221
07:40:33,780 --> 07:40:35,540
wow I'm getting slowed down by the

5222
07:40:38,180 --> 07:40:39,860
enough enough enough I'm getting slowed down

5223
07:40:40,740 --> 07:40:42,740
oh

5224
07:40:45,780 --> 07:40:47,220
that's all right you just want to spend more time

5225
07:40:48,980 --> 07:40:51,940
yeah see how you journey you have to say you're over you know you're still

5226
07:40:52,900 --> 07:40:54,100
running through the dank thing

5227
07:40:57,380 --> 07:40:58,340
but how about that

5228
07:41:00,340 --> 07:41:01,940
half the gears all day gone on

5229
07:41:03,860 --> 07:41:04,740
hydration check

5230
07:41:10,740 --> 07:41:15,460
when there's orders to fill the power cell in the system reactivate the thing

5231
07:41:16,980 --> 07:41:21,620
okay I'm analyzing the map so I can basically go everywhere

5232
07:41:22,660 --> 07:41:27,460
I just got the sweep since I was looking at it dog was getting shot in the background

5233
07:41:27,460 --> 07:41:28,580
literally the purvy thing

5234
07:41:30,340 --> 07:41:32,100
it's no therefore they spawned on time

5235
07:41:32,180 --> 07:41:34,340
uh

5236
07:41:36,980 --> 07:41:41,220
me oh it's such a shame purvy dogs also me the dogs won't leave me alone

5237
07:41:42,340 --> 07:41:49,060
I've had enough no that's too many no that's one too many so that's actually one too many

5238
07:41:49,060 --> 07:41:53,380
that's three too many if any more come at me I'm actually be region

5239
07:41:54,420 --> 07:41:57,940
this is too much how are you supposed to genuinely do this like

5240
07:41:57,940 --> 07:42:01,220
does the devs expect you to pause and do this every single time

5241
07:42:01,940 --> 07:42:05,940
there's no way I'm getting bit to death though

5242
07:42:07,860 --> 07:42:12,020
there's no way in heck I refuse I refuse

5243
07:42:13,940 --> 07:42:18,020
then we're gonna get spat on by the flies and then there's mere dogs

5244
07:42:21,300 --> 07:42:26,020
okay I somehow am making it do I need to take a little to the

5245
07:42:26,580 --> 07:42:30,100
okay I need to drop the buggy when I get ahead here

5246
07:42:31,460 --> 07:42:34,740
and then I'll have gone through the section pretty quickly

5247
07:42:42,020 --> 07:42:46,500
there okay we're all good again that is a pretty plan I honestly

5248
07:42:48,980 --> 07:42:50,260
I'm surprised I can

5249
07:42:52,660 --> 07:42:52,980
wow

5250
07:42:52,980 --> 07:42:58,100
okay there's allies ahead that's all I could see

5251
07:43:02,340 --> 07:43:06,260
mate you're just letting that plant absolutely decimate you for no reason

5252
07:43:09,700 --> 07:43:15,700
okay this is like so much easier can you actually burn the plants you know that oh wait wait wait

5253
07:43:15,700 --> 07:43:16,900
it's too many too many dogs

5254
07:43:17,060 --> 07:43:27,300
why are there so many multi-different colors but when you play like the navi side where you're

5255
07:43:27,300 --> 07:43:32,500
supposed to like be appreciating nature and stuff it's just like

5256
07:43:37,380 --> 07:43:43,060
if I have the backtrack one more time right thankfully I can teleport here

5257
07:43:44,020 --> 07:43:49,220
you make me backtrack one more time game I'm gonna have it out for you then I'll make myself clear

5258
07:44:04,900 --> 07:44:07,940
we surely must be getting back up soon with this one

5259
07:44:08,740 --> 07:44:12,580
I feel like we grabbed all the songs so what now

5260
07:44:17,220 --> 07:44:19,380
so we're to get in hard for deeds

5261
07:44:24,580 --> 07:44:28,020
um the navi side did the game is good the rda side

5262
07:44:29,620 --> 07:44:36,980
I'm just wanting it to be over with it's too hard like I'm genuinely hard no I'm not hard

5263
07:44:36,980 --> 07:44:40,020
sorry the game is genuinely hard on the rda side

5264
07:44:46,340 --> 07:44:49,300
okay so Kendra's got in doubts of what the thing is

5265
07:44:56,020 --> 07:44:58,100
and I don't mean I don't mean that um

5266
07:45:00,020 --> 07:45:04,340
so when we get the offer

5267
07:45:04,420 --> 07:45:13,860
why is it sending me this map is a nightmare to navigate I'm not being funny

5268
07:45:15,300 --> 07:45:21,300
this is probably one of the hardest maps this no this will this will be the hardest map ever

5269
07:45:23,220 --> 07:45:28,340
that I've had to navigate and do all this stuff and I don't even know where to start maybe the one

5270
07:45:28,340 --> 07:45:35,940
to my left if I take a left and then before no if I take a left and then take a right

5271
07:45:38,340 --> 07:45:42,180
this is the filter for the human campaign literally like

5272
07:45:44,020 --> 07:45:51,060
it's getting rough it's getting rough being like told to go and I know they provide transport

5273
07:45:51,060 --> 07:45:58,740
via the the mechs and the the buggies and that but if you're going to do it that your buggy health

5274
07:45:58,740 --> 07:46:04,820
makes you explode and you have to reload there's no point in providing that kind of thing like it's

5275
07:46:04,820 --> 07:46:13,700
just name is gonna be wait if I can okay I can resurrect I need to take the first right though

5276
07:46:13,700 --> 07:46:21,940
I can resurrect but it's fine oh please don't I'm gonna run out of hiding

5277
07:46:26,420 --> 07:46:33,380
I am running for my life I didn't even know they were going to do Thanos in the middle no no

5278
07:46:34,260 --> 07:46:39,700
please leave me alone please I ask kindly and respectfully to respect my space

5279
07:46:39,700 --> 07:46:48,980
I very kindly ask you to respect my social distance social distance please I don't know if

5280
07:46:48,980 --> 07:46:55,460
you've seen that Scottish meme where the guy goes social distance please but you said it so politely

5281
07:46:57,940 --> 07:47:06,180
I'm I'm just hauling ass there's no way I'd make this without oh right where's it up here to be honest

5282
07:47:06,820 --> 07:47:12,740
okay this is actually okay I'll give the game devs something this is actually kind of cool I like

5283
07:47:12,740 --> 07:47:23,140
the classic like spiral up something I'll see it I'll see it whoa lovely lovely thank you devs

5284
07:47:23,140 --> 07:47:28,260
thank you devs for putting a crack in the fricked rock stairwell I'll take everything I said back

5285
07:47:28,260 --> 07:47:36,420
about this design take it all back random gap in the stairwell whilst you're getting

5286
07:47:36,420 --> 07:47:41,860

5355
07:56:21,380 --> 07:56:31,860
to get down there there's no way to fall down there safely well well I need to do a big old U-turn

5356
07:56:32,980 --> 07:56:40,660
do you hate the navi yet no I hate playing the RDA say to deal with the navi I can see that much

5357
07:56:40,660 --> 07:56:46,900
very strongly but I don't understand how there's plants around here that the navi can claim

5358
07:56:47,540 --> 07:56:49,220
because that it's not like I can you like it

5359
07:56:54,100 --> 07:56:57,460

5372
07:58:11,860 --> 07:58:16,980

5373
07:58:16,980 --> 07:58:23,980
did I get there though I go forward and take a right

5374
07:58:24,220 --> 07:58:30,540
surely I'm a bit I'm a bit disoriented on this map if I take a right on this

5375
07:58:30,540 --> 07:58:39,820
log if I get on that log then I should be able to do you mind honestly give me a

5376
07:58:39,820 --> 07:58:44,020
jump scare whenever he is like hanging about honestly I can't believe it I

5377
07:58:44,020 --> 07:58:49,860
can't believe that you're hanging about on your planet they really wanted you to

5378
07:58:49,860 --> 07:58:54,180
know that the RDA or the bad guys literally so punishing to play the RDA

5379
07:58:54,180 --> 07:58:58,780
side sorry but it like Navi so easy I was an overcritical but I don't think the

5380
07:58:58,780 --> 07:59:04,580
game is balanced well it just it just seems like unless I'm missing like the

5381
07:59:04,580 --> 07:59:10,020
gun that you're supposed to use in quotation marks I am getting brutally

5382
07:59:10,020 --> 07:59:16,820
oh no I don't use the teleport I do 180 and I go this way just to make triple

5383
07:59:16,820 --> 07:59:22,220
sure yeah I do not want to take off in the wrong direction it's punishing but

5384
07:59:22,220 --> 07:59:28,580
fun if it's fun for you to watch me get punished then sure punish me away but

5385
07:59:28,620 --> 07:59:41,780
this is region just think I'm just doing so bad I can hear again they gave you a

5386
07:59:41,780 --> 07:59:52,340
guard down for stealth no run kills off I hope this is the area I'm gonna cry if

5387
07:59:52,380 --> 08:00:00,060
this is like a dead end up here both to play and watch you honestly I never

5388
08:00:00,060 --> 08:00:03,580
understood like streamers that can like punish themselves over and over the same

5389
08:00:03,580 --> 08:00:11,220
game like I just don't well that's what I don't want none of that I swear if

5390
08:00:11,220 --> 08:00:21,860
there's a dog behind me stop it okay that's him there I'm really not

5391
08:00:21,900 --> 08:00:27,460
interested in going down to get wrecked by all the other NPCs as well but I don't

5392
08:00:27,460 --> 08:00:36,940

5409
08:03:11,580 --> 08:03:14,300
know there's buggies everywhere but I don't even want to get in them because

5430
08:05:24,820 --> 08:05:36,180

5431
08:05:36,180 --> 08:05:41,820
way I'm gonna make it to the location some people enjoy suffering myself

5432
08:05:41,820 --> 08:05:46,660
included but do you enjoy watching suffering like I actually don't mind

5433
08:05:46,660 --> 08:05:50,780
watching like a binding of Isaac runs and if the person like struggles to get

5434
08:05:50,780 --> 08:05:54,860
through it but still wins like I don't mind watching like I find it quite

5435
08:05:54,860 --> 08:06:01,300
entertaining all right if I take the vines across yeah yeah okay oh and there

5436

5443

above me it must be the Navi above me okay the Navi are oh there he is

5465
08:10:00,700 --> 08:10:15,860
mm-hmm I have a problem and that problem is everyone has heists advantage over me

5466
08:10:16,020 --> 08:10:28,120
yeah this unless they come down and bite me I am in so much trouble oh dear I'm

5467
08:10:28,160 --> 08:10:33,400
gonna get snagged out of it I don't have infinite ammo I can't be messing around

5468
08:10:33,400 --> 08:10:44,480
like that I don't have it now is there really no way for me to go unless it's

5469
08:10:44,480 --> 08:10:54,080
over here I get out no it's wow this is like really rare to see in a video game

5470
08:10:54,080 --> 08:10:59,240
unless I'm just I don't play many video games I really do not recall levels

5471
08:10:59,240 --> 08:11:05,600
where you can't even reach the person I don't know maybe I'm being silly yeah

5472
08:11:05,600 --> 08:11:13,560
see this is right you can go right one down I don't know how much health he has

5473
08:11:13,560 --> 08:11:22,000
but bro I can't I cannot be spraying him with pistols like oh wait I have infinite

5474
08:11:22,000 --> 08:11:34,680
ammo here silly me silly Billy hold on I saw that shooting I just spray him the

5475
08:11:34,680 --> 08:11:40,600
entire time then I mean I'll do it don't think I won't you don't have to tell me

5476
08:11:40,600 --> 08:11:45,920
twice if it's a spring free mission sure he just runs around in circles over and

5477
08:11:46,680 --> 08:11:52,280
sadly I can't seem to reach the other NPCs oh they're attacking me actually

5478
08:11:52,280 --> 08:12:04,480
getting they jump in yeah whoa the AI is so brutal as a mavi sorry hold on I'm

5479
08:12:04,480 --> 08:12:09,440
starting to I don't know if I should actually just focus on the main guy you

5480
08:12:10,160 --> 08:12:16,520
said the I don't know if they're infinitely respawning or not that's the

5481
08:12:16,520 --> 08:12:21,760
reason why I want to clear them out but I'm getting the feeling they're

5482
08:12:21,760 --> 08:12:34,400
infinitely responding maybe oh I just destroyed that plant where is it wow I'm

5483
08:12:34,400 --> 08:12:39,420
like actually struggling wow okay half hell I think just more I think just more

5484
08:12:39,420 --> 08:12:54,420
down it's the best I got I'm just gonna tank it I'm I really am I'm just gonna

5485
08:12:54,420 --> 08:13:08,260
tank it yeah this definitely is given like battle dome unending and thanks

5486
08:13:08,300 --> 08:13:12,820
for waiting around until I stand up again actually do appreciate that AI oh that's

5487
08:13:12,820 --> 08:13:23,380
not good that's really not good oh this is what I was worried about but there's

5488
08:13:23,380 --> 08:13:33,220
definitely more spawning and I'm not way sure what the answer is other than

5489
08:13:33,220 --> 08:13:40,100
spray him that's really the best I can do just hope that we mavi cross hairs

5490
08:13:40,100 --> 08:13:44,340
going on he is getting staggered he is getting staggered there's there's no

5491
08:13:44,340 --> 08:13:52,940
denying that but the Navier again our control up here I don't have high the

5492
08:13:52,940 --> 08:13:59,980
plants keep respawning I don't know if maybe the plants the battle rifle can

5501
08:15:08,660 --> 08:15:14,980
game just constantly is resupplying with new Navi for this guy it makes me

5502
08:15:14,980 --> 08:15:21,740
think this is the last boss fight in the last match though because this is big

5503
08:15:21,740 --> 08:15:30,180

5561
08:23:50,060 --> 08:23:55,420
oh there you can get to the dormant site and stop Falco wait so you need to stop

5562
08:23:55,420 --> 08:24:02,060
Falco and either scenario anyway Falco's gone rogue I gotta reach HQ and alert

5563
08:24:02,060 --> 08:24:04,180

08:24:34,380 --> 08:24:38,940
that's not funny because it doesn't work my job doesn't work so I can't make it rip

5568
08:24:38,940 --> 08:24:42,620
Falco's gone nuts basically scenario he's planning on using it to take over the

5569
08:24:42,620 --> 08:24:50,380
plan for himself lightly scenario I was gonna make a Falcon punch joke

5570

5694
08:41:54,440 --> 08:42:07,440
Thank the maker, this is a buggy old 2009 game. Eat lead in puke because oh my gosh this game

5695
08:42:07,440 --> 08:42:16,240
is so hard. I heard that, I heard you, I literally just heard you spawning. Oh yeah and just heal

5696
08:42:16,240 --> 08:42:20,240
up. No it's fine, it's fine, just heal all your health. It's fine, it doesn't matter.

5697
08:42:20,240 --> 08:42:31,240
It doesn't matter. No it doesn't matter at all. Get out of my face. No, no! All the time.

5698
08:42:31,240 --> 08:42:43,240
Get out, I'm literally freaking walling on stuff. Go away. Stop healing, stop healing.

5699
08:42:43,240 --> 08:42:54,240
Stop! I need to reload like this right now. Yeah, hold on, let me take a breather. I just

5700
08:42:54,240 --> 08:43:09,240
needed one breather, like literally a second to formulate a thought. Ah! Ah the freaking...

5701
08:43:09,240 --> 08:43:16,240
I'm trying so hard, I literally am trying so hard. This is just, and then just spawn

5702
08:43:16,240 --> 08:43:27,240
more navi there, they're coming down the hill. I'm stuck against something. Oh please, please!

5703
08:43:28,240 --> 08:43:42,240
Oh, um, uh, I cast protection. Oh, oh and um, oh, oh, don't do that, don't do that again,

5704
08:43:42,240 --> 08:43:56,240
that's not funny. Talk meeeeere! I'm gonna fucking lose it if I actually die here. Go and just

5705
08:43:56,240 --> 08:44:05,240
perish to the elements or something. This is insane. This is standing the field up. No.

5706
08:44:05,240 --> 08:44:11,240
Get staggered beyond belief and they don't stagger when they use that ability. And their

5707
08:44:11,240 --> 08:44:15,240
ability to freaking his own cooldown, there's no such thing as cooldown to them, they actually

5708
08:44:15,240 --> 08:44:23,240
don't know what it is. But my cooldown lasts forever! Literally I can't even cast protection.

5709
08:44:24,240 --> 08:44:34,240
Oh and I need to reload at the stupid freaking orange box! And I've got one. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

5710
08:44:34,240 --> 08:44:45,240
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No one's surprised. Freaking spraying. It's literally the more health...

5711
08:44:45,240 --> 08:44:52,240
No, yeah, you just do it again. Again with the same move. Oh this is getting ridiculous,

5712
08:44:52,240 --> 08:44:58,240
mate. Go and just get a rest, honestly. Oh and you'd repel back to health again because

5713
08:44:58,240 --> 08:45:03,240
you can't even just 1v fucking 1v. Literally, I'm not being funny, but if these are like

5714
08:45:03,240 --> 08:45:08,240
supposed to be avatars with like titanium bones and stuff and you literally can't 1v 1v without

5715
08:45:08,240 --> 08:45:14,240
fucking prayer protection on every 2 seconds with that stupid move!

5716
08:45:19,240 --> 08:45:33,240
Oh, fucking terrible, actually. Just perish! Honestly, stop using these abilities. Oh my god, man.

5717
08:45:33,240 --> 08:45:43,240
Yay, we did it! Let's go! Oh, I'm so glad that's over. Right, let's move on to the next one.

5718
08:45:43,240 --> 08:45:49,240
Yeah, and they're already shooting me. Already, already, already. Right, okay, we'll teleport.

5719
08:45:49,240 --> 08:45:55,240
Gigi easy. Oh, I just... I keep forgetting that I'm not as tall as Navi so I can't just

5720
08:45:55,240 --> 08:46:04,240
jump that. Oh, well, I didn't need to go on that so sure, whatever. We did it! That was awful.

5721
08:46:04,240 --> 08:46:10,240
That was awful. You don't even pick the difficulty in this thing. My controller is literally dripping

5722
08:46:10,240 --> 08:46:15,240
with sweat. I thought you loved having autism. It's such a nice little fun tree on the side,

5723
08:46:15,240 --> 08:46:22,240
doesn't it? Not. Oh, and I get to do one more. The protection prayer made me think this was

5724
08:46:22,240 --> 08:46:31,240
a runescape stream for a second. Yeah, literally. If I could cast it. Oh.

5725
08:46:35,240 --> 08:46:40,240
Is there a donation? Did I miss a donation? I think it's working. I don't know. Someone said

5726
08:46:40,240 --> 08:46:44,240
they couldn't but then I think a few more donations came through after that so I don't

5727
08:46:44,240 --> 08:46:51,240
know if it's messing up on Firefox or things are just not happy. Don't worry about it if

5728
08:46:51,240 --> 08:47:02,240
it's not working. Oh, sorry. I just... Oh, I just choked on that. What month to go?

5729
08:47:02,240 --> 08:47:16,240
Plain? Take a scorpion and report to the last commander. Yeah, let's try it. Oh. You'll read

5730
08:47:16,240 --> 08:47:23,240
it later. I just sent one a bit ago. I don't see it. You're not the only one to say that

5731
08:47:23,240 --> 08:47:30,240
you've sent a thingy but it's not came through. I don't know why. The last one I see is from

5732
08:47:30,240 --> 08:47:38,240
TinySpiny. It says I've returned from the dog. Wait, did it actually not go through? I don't

5733
08:47:38,240 --> 08:47:42,240
want you to don't know if it's not showing up seriously though. Like if it's not showing

5734
08:47:42,240 --> 08:47:50,240
up, don't know. I don't know what's going on. Where the heck? What am I supposed to go

5735
08:47:50,240 --> 08:47:54,240
on my... Can I just fly through that? Oh, no. I have to fly through the gap. I can already

5736
08:47:54,240 --> 08:48:06,240
tell. The last commander seems promising. I can hope so. The RDA site is... It's been

5737
08:48:06,240 --> 08:48:17,240
an experience but I'm not sure it's been won for... Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Let's just

5738
08:48:17,240 --> 08:48:21,240
break through the rocks. Don't mind me. Don't worry. I'm always happy to escort my local

5739
08:48:21,240 --> 08:48:29,240
calm fish. I know I wouldn't display them. Where am I going? Just a little to the right.

5740
08:48:29,240 --> 08:48:35,240
Oh, my goodness. Okay, there's the helipad that I'm supposed to land on. Thank goodness. Make

5741
08:48:35,240 --> 08:48:45,240
it nice and easy for me. A little cheeky crash land in there. Don't mind me. Is this not it?

5742
08:48:45,240 --> 08:48:50,240
Looks like it. At least when it's over, you can see you've finally completed the game.

5743
08:48:50,240 --> 08:48:57,240
Honestly, it's been fun but there's a reason my Tism didn't attach on this game too much

5744
08:48:57,240 --> 08:49:04,240
because there's quite a few things like that that are really annoying. Hey, last one.

5745
08:49:04,240 --> 08:49:07,240
Oh.

5746
08:49:11,240 --> 08:49:16,240
The only reason I could even win that last fight is because I managed to cheat that Thanotaur.

5747
08:49:16,240 --> 08:49:21,240
I cannot imagine if I would even get past that if that Thanotaur didn't get caught in the

5748
08:49:21,240 --> 08:49:26,240
roll. I'm sorry. I said that wrong.

5749
08:49:31,240 --> 08:49:34,240
Am I allowed to slide to get there?

5750
08:49:34,240 --> 08:49:39,240
I'm going to be giving me a mix. I'll take a mix because he's giving me a mix.

5751
08:49:39,240 --> 08:49:46,240
Then you can play the domination minigame. I like on the navi side. I've never played it on this side.

5752
08:49:47,240 --> 08:49:55,240
Alrighty. If I take a right, then everything shall be alright.

5753
08:49:55,240 --> 08:50:00,240
Let's hope this last one. Strony, you sound sleepy. I hope you're having fun.

5754
08:50:00,240 --> 08:50:03,240
You know, I'm having fun. I know that sounds like a-

5755
08:50:03,240 --> 08:50:09,240
That's a fat punch. I'm getting spawned spanked by a freaking plant.

5756
08:50:10,240 --> 08:50:15,240
I'm enjoying it. It's just because I've never played it before.

5757
08:50:15,240 --> 08:50:20,240
I just did not expect at all how unbelievably hard it was.

5758
08:50:20,240 --> 08:50:27,240
For example, there's RDA soldiers literally getting messed up by these plants.

5759
08:50:27,240 --> 08:50:33,240
They're just letting it happen. I had no idea they would make it so hard.

5760
08:50:33,240 --> 08:50:36,240
On the navi side, you can just ignore everything.

5761
08:50:36,240 --> 08:50:40,240
But when you're a wee human, you actually can't ignore everything.

5762
08:50:40,240 --> 08:50:43,240
Or else you're like a big doo-doo.

5763
08:50:54,240 --> 08:50:59,240
I'm hoping I do get a good night's sleep soon because it's really hard to be creative.

5764
08:50:59,240 --> 08:51:05,240
RDAs and MarkoLabs are coming up with scripts when I've literally got no thoughts going on behind my skull.

5765
08:51:10,240 --> 08:51:12,240
There's RDAs.

5766
08:51:14,240 --> 08:51:18,240
I'm actually going to pick it up because they're too valuable.

5767
08:51:18,240 --> 08:51:21,240
Wait, I can't even go up on my head.

5768
08:51:23,240 --> 08:51:26,240
Okay, I need to climb on foot.

5769
08:51:27,240 --> 08:51:30,240
RDAs say it's too real sad.

5770
08:51:30,240 --> 08:51:32,240
I hope you're doing a good night's sleep.

5771
08:51:32,240 --> 08:51:36,240
Yeah, I've not had a decent one in quite a while.

5772
08:51:36,240 --> 08:51:39,240
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

5773
08:51:39,240 --> 08:51:42,240
Okay, that was good. I like that.

5774
08:51:42,240 --> 08:51:45,240
I think it tears that fast all the time. That's great.

5775
08:51:47,240 --> 08:51:54,240
See, when it misses, it really bothers me.

5776
08:51:57,240 --> 08:52:01,240
Oh, I'm just going in biz. I don't know. There's enemies everywhere.

5777
08:52:05,240 --> 08:52:07,240
Oh, I can hear one right behind me.

5778
08:52:07,240 --> 08:52:10,240
I'm going to try and claim this before default.

5779
08:52:10,240 --> 08:52:12,240
Get some rest. I will get some good rest.

5780
08:52:12,240 --> 08:52:15,240
I don't know what my stream is tomorrow. I can't remember.

5781
08:52:15,240 --> 08:52:17,240
Is it ASMR?

5782
08:52:20,240 --> 08:52:22,240
Or is that a small game?

5783
08:52:23,240 --> 08:52:26,240
I think it goes ASMR sweets.

5784
08:52:26,240 --> 08:52:28,240
Oh, this is a boss fight.

5785
08:52:28,240 --> 08:52:30,240
Yeah, I'm already getting ruled.

5786
08:52:30,240 --> 08:52:32,240
Oh, I'm already getting ruled by boss.

5787
08:52:32,240 --> 08:52:34,240
Okay, this is what I can't stand.

5788
08:52:34,240 --> 08:52:39,240
I'm about to go do a boss fight and there's like a billion rub.

5789
08:52:39,240 --> 08:52:42,240
Nah, nah, come on, mate.

5790
08:52:43,240 --> 08:52:45,240
Yeah, this is getting ridiculous.

5791
08:52:46,240 --> 08:52:48,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5792
08:52:48,240 --> 08:52:51,240
Thank goodness I was picking up RDA things.

5793
08:52:53,240 --> 08:52:54,240
Whoa.

5794
08:52:57,240 --> 08:52:59,240
No, no, you're so dead.

5795
08:52:59,240 --> 08:53:00,240
Get that.

5796
08:53:01,240 --> 08:53:05,240
Right, a spell of protection, spell of invincibility,

5797
08:53:05,240 --> 08:53:07,240
because what the actual?

5798
08:53:09,240 --> 08:53:11,240
Bro, you're going to need to let...

5799
08:53:12,240 --> 08:53:14,240
I'm dead on the last one.

5800
08:53:15,240 --> 08:53:16,240
I need a breather.

5801
08:53:17,240 --> 08:53:22,240
I literally need a health breather.

5802
08:53:22,240 --> 08:53:25,240
The AI can freaking see me.

5803
08:53:28,240 --> 08:53:31,240
Yeah, she literally won't go down

5804
08:53:31,240 --> 08:53:34,240
because she keeps activating all of her abilities.

5805
08:53:34,240 --> 08:53:36,240
This is ridiculous.

5806
08:53:40,240 --> 08:53:42,240
Right, so they're...

5807
08:53:43,240 --> 08:53:45,240
Okay.

5808
08:53:47,240 --> 08:53:50,240
Bro, you're just stun-locking me.

5809
08:53:52,240 --> 08:53:54,240
I literally can't get close enough.

5810
08:53:57,240 --> 08:54:00,240
Yeah, how do you like being fucking stun-locked?

5811
08:54:00,240 --> 08:54:02,240
Oh, fuck off!

5812
08:54:03,240 --> 08:54:06,240
Just infinite spawn after spot.

5813
08:54:06,240 --> 08:54:08,240
So get the fucking moab out, honestly.

5814
08:54:09,240 --> 08:54:12,240
What the fucking is this shit, honestly?

5815
08:54:17,240 --> 08:54:19,240
Have I activated it?

5816
08:54:19,240 --> 08:54:20,240
Hello, stamina?

5817
08:54:26,240 --> 08:54:27,240
Lovely.

5818
08:54:28,240 --> 08:54:29,240
Let me analize.

5819
08:54:29,240 --> 08:54:31,240
That did a sweet fuck all.

5820
08:54:31,240 --> 08:54:32,240
Lovely, lovely.

5821
08:54:32,240 --> 08:54:35,240
Don't ever show your fucking hideous face again.

5822
08:54:35,240 --> 08:54:37,240
That was what bloody waste that was.

5823
08:54:38,240 --> 08:54:40,240
Right, that's the best I got, Berserk.

5824
08:54:41,240 --> 08:54:43,240
Berserk's literally the best I got.

5825
08:54:44,240 --> 08:54:47,240
And I get stunned the moment I use it.

5826
08:54:51,240 --> 08:54:54,240
Bro, I need to put a little invisible on

5827
08:54:54,240 --> 08:54:56,240
so I can literally heal in time.

5828
08:54:58,240 --> 08:55:01,240
I'm gonna get stunned the millisecond.

5829
08:55:06,240 --> 08:55:09,240
This is why I don't play read games on stream

5830
08:55:09,240 --> 08:55:12,240
because I literally can't even handle a normal game.

5831
08:55:13,240 --> 08:55:15,240
And then invisible again so I can't get him

5832
08:55:15,240 --> 08:55:17,240
and then tarot him shooting at me

5833
08:55:17,240 --> 08:55:19,240
and then stun me, and stun me, and stun me,

5834
08:55:19,240 --> 08:55:21,240
and stun me, and stun me, and stun me.

5835
08:55:21,240 --> 08:55:23,240
Okay, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it, we get it.

5836
08:55:23,240 --> 08:55:25,240
We love a good stun, we all...

5837
08:55:26,240 --> 08:55:28,240
And then, yeah, and then into the spawn rate.

5838
08:55:28,240 --> 08:55:29,240
What are their abilities?

5839
08:55:29,240 --> 08:55:31,240
You literally just use that one

5840
08:55:31,240 --> 08:55:34,240
so you don't even have a cooldown at all.

5841
08:55:34,240 --> 08:55:37,240
Oh, and then in comes your buddy use.

5842
08:55:37,240 --> 08:55:39,240
Yeah, and then your buddy uses their ability.

5843
08:55:39,240 --> 08:55:42,240
And then I'm away wasting ammo yet again.

5844
08:55:42,240 --> 08:55:45,240
Oh, yeah, again, I'm not the frickin' boss.

5845
08:55:47,240 --> 08:55:49,240
You're gonna need to get a great game.

5846
08:55:49,240 --> 08:55:51,240
Honestly, you're gonna need, again, a straight to ability.

5847
08:55:51,240 --> 08:55:53,240
Can't, need to wait, need to wait.

5848
08:55:56,240 --> 08:55:58,240
Again, straight to ability.

5849
08:55:58,240 --> 08:56:00,240
Fucking infinite, buddy.

5850
08:56:00,240 --> 08:56:02,240
Yep, and then the gift.

5851
08:56:02,240 --> 08:56:04,240
No, oh, a Christmas miracle.

5852
08:56:04,240 --> 08:56:06,240
I actually got a fucking thing from it.

5853
08:56:08,240 --> 08:56:09,240
Wow.

5854
08:56:09,240 --> 08:56:11,240
Oh, and your pal's already back.

5855
08:56:12,240 --> 08:56:14,240
I've not even been away for, like, on the list, I think.

5856
08:56:15,240 --> 08:56:18,240
I'm gonna have to go into this and fucking do this, right?

5857
08:56:18,240 --> 08:56:20,240
At least I've reloaded, but...

5858
08:56:21,240 --> 08:56:23,240
Yeah, and I'm already in spanked.

5859
08:56:23,240 --> 08:56:25,240
I don't even remember the fucking enemy that I'm supposed to be killing is.

5860
08:56:25,240 --> 08:56:27,240
Oh, and straight to the ability.

5861
08:56:27,240 --> 08:56:29,240
What a classic.

5862
08:56:30,240 --> 08:56:32,240
Oh, more of your pal's!

5863
08:56:35,240 --> 08:56:36,240
There's nothing I can do.

5864
08:56:36,240 --> 08:56:39,240
There's actually nothing I can do other than tick damage.

5865
08:56:39,240 --> 08:56:44,240
This is just the tiniest amount of damage that can be dealt at any moment.

5866
08:56:44,240 --> 08:56:45,240
And it just...

5867
08:56:45,240 --> 08:56:47,240
Over and over again!

5868
08:56:49,240 --> 08:56:52,240
Literally playing this game over and over again.

5869
08:56:52,240 --> 08:56:54,240
One hit, get nothing more.

5870
08:56:54,240 --> 08:56:56,240
Have to heal, get nothing more.

5871
08:56:56,240 --> 08:56:58,240
Just fucking perish off.

5872
08:56:58,240 --> 08:57:00,240
Fucking map!

5873
08:57:01,240 --> 08:57:03,240
Uh, I'm dead. I'm actually dead.

5874
08:57:04,240 --> 08:57:07,240
I don't have a invis, and I don't have a heal.

5875
08:57:10,240 --> 08:57:13,240
I don't know what you want me to do.

5876
08:57:16,240 --> 08:57:18,240
Who made this? Ubisoft?

5877
08:57:19,240 --> 08:57:20,240
How many game...

5878
08:57:20,240 --> 08:57:22,240
How many fucking playtesters have you got?

5879
08:57:22,240 --> 08:57:24,240
Like, one max, maybe?

5880
08:57:24,240 --> 08:57:26,240
Do you share one for, like, one fucking region?

5881
08:57:26,240 --> 08:57:27,240
One for whole of Oceanic?

5882
08:57:27,240 --> 08:57:28,240
One for whole of Bloody Europe?

5883
08:57:28,240 --> 08:57:30,240
One for whole of fucking America?

5884
08:57:30,240 --> 08:57:31,240
Like, what's going on?

5885
08:57:31,240 --> 08:57:32,240
None of you's playtested this.

5886
08:57:32,240 --> 08:57:33,240
Not one person.

5887
08:57:33,240 --> 08:57:35,240
Not one person!

5888
08:57:35,240 --> 08:57:37,240
Listen!

5889
08:57:38,240 --> 08:57:40,240
Oh, let me just analyze and see if this is...

5890
08:57:40,240 --> 08:57:41,240
There seems fair.

5891
08:57:41,240 --> 08:57:42,240
Hmm...

5892
08:57:42,240 --> 08:57:45,240
Right, let's do infinite spawning.

5893
08:57:45,240 --> 08:57:47,240
Let's make sure you get stun law, right?

5894
08:57:47,240 --> 08:57:48,240
Okay, hmm...

5895
08:57:48,240 --> 08:57:49,240
Alright, let's do it.

5896
08:57:49,240 --> 08:57:50,240
Let's do it!

5897
08:57:50,240 --> 08:57:52,240
Let's do a cheeky gangbang!

5898
08:57:52,240 --> 08:57:54,240
Oh my God!

5899
08:57:54,240 --> 08:57:56,240
Let's just do a cheeky gangbang and make sure that the enemies...

5900
08:57:56,240 --> 08:57:58,240
Enemies are allowed to infinite heal.

5901
08:57:58,240 --> 08:58:00,240
It's fine. Enemies can infinite heal.

5902
08:58:00,240 --> 08:58:02,240
Enemies can infinite fucking use their abilities.

5903
08:58:02,240 --> 08:58:03,240
All the fucking time!

5904
08:58:03,240 --> 08:58:08,240
And as soon as you give them a Santa me are off of their HP bar

5905
08:58:08,240 --> 08:58:14,600
Oh, let's just make sure they just give them everything all it wants infinite fucking mana. Oh

5906
08:58:14,900 --> 08:58:16,900
My god

5907
08:58:16,900 --> 08:58:18,900
Just let it be over with

5908
08:58:19,140 --> 08:58:22,840
Just let it happen. Oh my god

5909
08:58:25,760 --> 08:58:27,760
Like I literally need to go invisible

5910
08:58:28,160 --> 08:58:33,520
Oh my god, just let it be over

5911
08:58:34,840 --> 08:58:36,840
Just let it be over

5912
08:58:37,440 --> 08:58:43,520
Again, yeah instant stun lock as soon as you shit. I don't even have that ability is Navi when I play Navi

5913
08:58:43,520 --> 08:58:45,520
I don't even have this ability

5914
08:58:46,480 --> 08:58:51,240
Just instant fucking lock over and over and and your pals are back

5915
08:58:51,960 --> 08:58:53,960
I

5916
08:58:54,720 --> 08:58:59,320
Would absolutely love to have a whole fucking trade behind me, but I've nobody got that extension have a

5917
08:59:22,240 --> 08:59:24,240
I

5918
08:59:32,280 --> 08:59:34,280
Best I can do

5919
08:59:40,720 --> 08:59:45,480
100 got 100 shotgun shells was there enough may you go get more

5920
08:59:46,200 --> 08:59:54,960
Because it was now of course it was down off. Oh, yeah, no, it's fine. No, it's fine. I didn't want one

5921
09:00:00,040 --> 09:00:02,040
Yep, no, it's fine. I

5922
09:00:04,600 --> 09:00:06,600
Love being absolutely incapacitated

5923
09:00:09,280 --> 09:00:11,280
No, this is so fun

5924
09:00:12,280 --> 09:00:13,800
I

5925
09:00:13,800 --> 09:00:21,560
Love it. You should do it more Ashley. How about you just spawn eight NPCs all fucking one said one time. Oh my fucking god

5926
09:00:23,200 --> 09:00:28,280
Fucking RDA fan is honestly. Oh, and I'm probably gonna die jumping off this clutch looking me

5927
09:00:28,640 --> 09:00:33,460
Just to really fucking ace it on the cake. They just actually can he stop it. They actually

5928
09:00:37,120 --> 09:00:39,120
Yeah

5929
09:00:41,880 --> 09:00:48,040
Yep, and all aimed even though in viz all in will continue probably not even be able to heal and play man

5930
09:00:48,040 --> 09:00:49,400
I get to die

5931
09:00:49,400 --> 09:00:53,000
Because I only have one fucking RDA element to my fucking name

5932
09:00:53,640 --> 09:00:55,640
But here

5933
09:00:58,240 --> 09:00:59,920
Yeah

5934
09:00:59,920 --> 09:01:04,880
This better be the last mission. I am like fucking correct right now. I

5935
09:01:05,920 --> 09:01:08,640
Really hope like I severely hope this is the last mission

5936
09:01:08,640 --> 09:01:10,640
I

5937
09:01:11,000 --> 09:01:13,840
Instant damage to the mech not even in the body sign

5938
09:01:15,920 --> 09:01:20,240
For the cheeky gang bang party parrot party parrot party parrot

5939
09:01:22,040 --> 09:01:25,320
It's never fucking ending volt was it vault

5940
09:01:27,000 --> 09:01:33,720
Vulcan thank you for the tip. It's never ending. There is no way that was

5941
09:01:34,120 --> 09:01:37,880
appropriately play tested unless I'm missing like

5942
09:01:38,640 --> 09:01:45,720
Some major notes and I missed a massive patch that came out for this game in 2009 that there's no

5943
09:01:46,200 --> 09:01:47,200
way

5944
09:01:47,200 --> 09:01:51,720
That is the gameplay and then the dev team happy with that game

5945
09:01:53,720 --> 09:01:56,840
Refused to accept that that even got passed

5946
09:01:59,560 --> 09:02:02,060
Absolutely refused to accept that got passed I

5947
09:02:02,260 --> 09:02:11,340
Don't think anyone got this far in the police say I completely agree with that statement because what on earth was that

5948
09:02:12,980 --> 09:02:17,380
Literally, I don't have an ability when I play Navi if I get hit I have a massive fucking throbbing

5949
09:02:17,700 --> 09:02:23,020
Fucking pulse coming from a bloody groin. No, I don't want to teleport. I want to talk to the man

5950
09:02:26,300 --> 09:02:28,300
Please let it be over

5951
09:02:32,980 --> 09:02:35,260
Hmm let it be over

5952
09:02:36,820 --> 09:02:38,820
Let it be over. Yeah, I'm not

5953
09:02:42,820 --> 09:02:44,820
Let it be over

5954
09:02:47,380 --> 09:02:51,420
Yeah, that Moab did absolutely nothing. I don't even know what the point of that was

5955
09:02:53,020 --> 09:02:57,820
Let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over let it be over

5956
09:02:58,820 --> 09:03:01,620
Thanks for borrowing a condom

5957
09:03:05,980 --> 09:03:09,860
This game was pretty bad pretty fast after lunch thanks to the game getting canned hard

5958
09:03:10,620 --> 09:03:16,260
And took their money in around I mean they made them if they got two points seven million sales. Yeah

5959
09:03:22,420 --> 09:03:24,420
Are we there

5960
09:03:24,460 --> 09:03:30,620
You so much you put a scratch there there last at least the section saying you were you mean that wasn't the last section

5961
09:03:30,620 --> 09:03:33,020
Are you implying there is more to this fucking thing?

5962
09:03:33,620 --> 09:03:36,740
Horses or did you to board a dragon to fly to some location?

5963
09:03:37,460 --> 09:03:40,780
This is why mommy likes me hold her hand. Yes. This is why I like

5964
09:03:45,500 --> 09:03:50,140
You're still streaming. Oh, you just missed the part where I screamed down the make so yeah

5965
09:03:51,020 --> 09:03:53,020
Oh

5966
09:03:54,620 --> 09:03:59,380
Please let me go with this right why does the conductor keep putting me on?

5967
09:03:59,820 --> 09:04:03,860
Why did they keep creating more and more sections of this fucking site of the map?

5968
09:04:08,380 --> 09:04:13,580
Okay, this is it this is it the map looks like this is it there's nothing more of the matter

5969
09:04:14,140 --> 09:04:16,140
We just got worth it fuck was gone broke. Oh

5970
09:04:17,780 --> 09:04:23,220
Well, we all pretended that you finished the game and you can go risk. No, this is it

5971
09:04:23,820 --> 09:04:29,300
Look at the map. There's no way this map is a fetch quest because look at the state of it. There's nothing on it. Oh

5972
09:04:31,820 --> 09:04:33,820
Did I get to drive this at least

5973
09:04:35,380 --> 09:04:37,380
It's over

5974
09:04:37,820 --> 09:04:39,820
It's over

5975
09:04:40,660 --> 09:04:43,700
Oh, how do I fly this? Oh fuck me, man. Oh

5976
09:04:45,980 --> 09:04:48,660
No, oh no, I don't like that. Oh, no

5977
09:04:51,580 --> 09:04:58,060
Right, okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, huh. Oh, yeah, I can fly I can fly

5978
09:04:59,620 --> 09:05:03,380
Call me Peter Pan because you can fly you can fly you can fly

5979
09:05:04,380 --> 09:05:09,580
Okay, take it easy easy on the corners easy

5980
09:05:10,700 --> 09:05:17,900
Pandora is a little wild for the road bumps and by road bumps the full mass of asphalt

5981
09:05:21,020 --> 09:05:23,020
You can shoot the rocks

5982
09:05:27,100 --> 09:05:29,100
Oh

5983
09:05:29,100 --> 09:05:31,100
Oh

5984
09:05:31,980 --> 09:05:33,980
Wait, I'm gonna run out of missiles

5985
09:05:42,100 --> 09:05:47,660
That was a very successful drive, I think I don't think I actually bumped into one thing

5986
09:05:49,820 --> 09:05:51,820
Easy easy

5987
09:05:53,700 --> 09:05:55,700
Oh

5988
09:06:00,100 --> 09:06:04,740
Okay, there are wolves, but that's fine. Nothing I can't handle. Oh

5989
09:06:06,420 --> 09:06:09,900
I can't do my little flip in the war. It will flip

5990
09:06:12,300 --> 09:06:14,300
What kind of sadistic

5991
09:06:15,020 --> 09:06:18,500
Made to say you should be able to run out of missiles honestly

5992
09:06:18,500 --> 09:06:25,100
It does seem about like that flight thing that flying dragon is massive and you're telling me they can't hold more than like 20

5993
09:06:25,100 --> 09:06:27,100
missiles. Oh

5994
09:06:27,500 --> 09:06:32,820
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Why are you holding that piece of paper? Oh

5995
09:06:46,500 --> 09:06:48,500
What's the plan

5996
09:06:49,500 --> 09:06:51,500
I'm not going anywhere near me

5997
09:06:52,500 --> 09:06:58,020
We could use your help get that wall down and dig in I'm gonna do I'm gonna put down TNT

5998
09:06:59,540 --> 09:07:06,980
As long as there's no boss fight, I couldn't be less of a rats or what fetch quest you send me on name your boss fights

5999
09:07:08,340 --> 09:07:11,380
What is this? What is this armor?

6000
09:07:13,500 --> 09:07:17,260
Protection down but everything else up. I think I'd rather protection up

6001
09:07:19,380 --> 09:07:21,380
Just leave it leave it

6002
09:07:21,700 --> 09:07:23,700
What's this? Right? What's the deal?

6003
09:07:25,100 --> 09:07:27,100
What much I do?

6004
09:07:27,980 --> 09:07:32,220
As long as there's no boss fight on the other side, I couldn't give the last of a rat

6005
09:07:34,100 --> 09:07:36,100
I couldn't give the last rat

6006
09:07:40,980 --> 09:07:42,980
Anymore

6007
09:07:43,980 --> 09:07:48,380
If the goal was to make the count and pain memorable they should be sure succeeded

6008
09:07:48,500 --> 09:07:50,860
Oh, I'd say more like miserable because

6009
09:07:51,820 --> 09:07:56,700
Again, like literally the Navi instantly do that as soon as you injure them. They do their thing

6010
09:07:58,500 --> 09:08:00,500
Except that one I guess

6011
09:08:01,940 --> 09:08:05,660
Let's just let's navigate we're appropriate

6012
09:08:08,980 --> 09:08:10,980
I don't know if I should just speed run it

6013
09:08:12,500 --> 09:08:14,980
Can the make even go on the bridge that's up ahead?

6014
09:08:19,500 --> 09:08:21,500
Oh

6015
09:08:22,580 --> 09:08:29,060
Like this game parish definitely, yeah, thanks for that really appreciate that. Um

6016
09:08:31,340 --> 09:08:35,780
Why am I being shot? I'm being chased. I'm being chased

6017
09:08:38,900 --> 09:08:40,900
Um

6018
09:08:41,900 --> 09:08:47,700
Oh, yeah, definitely happy to replay that's true brotherhood not happy to replay

6019
09:08:50,820 --> 09:08:54,940
The Navi side yay fun the RDA side. Oh my god

6020
09:08:56,420 --> 09:09:01,660
I think I've almost got two revives, but I don't think I have a boss fight anymore

6021
09:09:01,660 --> 09:09:03,660
I think this is literally just

6022
09:09:03,660 --> 09:09:05,660
Spring pray from here on out

6023
09:09:10,900 --> 09:09:12,900
Oh

6024
09:09:26,620 --> 09:09:31,420
That's a lot of Navi and they're probably gonna destroy my make-up. I'm not careful

6025
09:09:33,220 --> 09:09:35,420
Where's BT when you need them honestly?

6026
09:09:41,900 --> 09:09:43,900
I

6027
09:09:44,340 --> 09:09:51,700
Might get out for that RDA dangerous, but I'm like it seems to be I just want a few revives on hand

6028
09:09:51,700 --> 09:09:53,700
Oh, right. I've got two revives now

6029
09:09:54,780 --> 09:09:58,420
As long as I can choose a hate thing if there's a fight ahead. I

6030
09:09:58,900 --> 09:10:00,900
Just hope this oh my god, my mix

6031
09:10:01,820 --> 09:10:03,820
Well, look at me. Let's just go for it

6032
09:10:03,940 --> 09:10:05,940
I

6033
09:10:08,780 --> 09:10:10,780
Right just go keep going

6034
09:10:11,260 --> 09:10:13,260
Just like there's fates all the way up ahead

6035
09:10:14,020 --> 09:10:16,020
We need BT

6036
09:10:17,700 --> 09:10:22,380
Honestly sorry for reason the idea of RDA, but thank you for experience in it

6037
09:10:23,260 --> 09:10:28,660
Thank you for experiencing the pain. I mean some people enjoy when streamers rage. I don't know

6038
09:10:29,540 --> 09:10:31,340
I

6039
09:10:31,340 --> 09:10:36,540
Got taken out in viz for that like some people genuinely love when streamers rage and I'm like

6040
09:10:38,180 --> 09:10:44,180
Hold off the Navi. No, you are not gonna make them literally

6041
09:10:50,180 --> 09:10:55,300
I don't know how freaking strong you think I am I am not that good. I that's

6042
09:10:56,260 --> 09:11:04,460
Okay, I'm gonna try and keep a lid on it and not get overwhelmed very quickly. I am so glad I picked up the other RDA

6043
09:11:08,780 --> 09:11:10,780
I can't do anything

6044
09:11:18,180 --> 09:11:20,180
Yeah, I'm gonna need you guys

6045
09:11:21,180 --> 09:11:23,180
I

6046
09:11:24,860 --> 09:11:29,500
Need everyone to start spamming needs everywhere because I'm pretty sure those are RDA needs

6047
09:11:29,500 --> 09:11:33,140
I'm gonna need everyone to do that unanimously unanimously right now

6048
09:11:35,180 --> 09:11:38,020
It's not it's okay, just sacrifice me in the fire

6049
09:11:40,660 --> 09:11:46,100
Oh, and I'm taking out in viz, which is the only time it helps to redo my

6050
09:11:50,900 --> 09:11:57,300
Okay, I feel and then the damage protection to tell I can get my heal back up

6051
09:11:59,620 --> 09:12:01,620
I need long range

6052
09:12:05,660 --> 09:12:12,420
Our bombs, okay, those are definitely our needs. I feel like if the Navi were doing needs like that, I'd be a goner already

6053
09:12:13,740 --> 09:12:16,380
Okay, okay, we're not overrun

6054
09:12:20,500 --> 09:12:27,100
But don't want to jinx it, but I'm gonna grab that it's really important

6055
09:12:29,180 --> 09:12:33,980
I'm really jinxed it but it's looking good only a minute 30 of this and then we're done

6056
09:12:39,620 --> 09:12:41,620
Okay

6057
09:12:42,860 --> 09:12:45,140
Protection on I don't really want to make me too much

6058
09:12:50,900 --> 09:12:52,900
I'll take

6059
09:12:57,060 --> 09:13:00,580
Okay, I don't know every spamming needs to keep doing that shit. Oh my god

6060
09:13:01,220 --> 09:13:05,860
It's literally sunlocking them from hitting us. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. Hold on. Oh

6061
09:13:09,300 --> 09:13:17,220
Dear I think I think maybe some of our soldiers went down because we're getting no, okay now we're overrun again

6062
09:13:20,180 --> 09:13:25,140
If I can just whittle down some base health on them, it just makes all the world is different

6063
09:13:33,700 --> 09:13:37,540
Oh, we might actually have three roses. Oh, I'm getting sunlocked my pardon

6064
09:13:39,860 --> 09:13:45,460
I'm not that mad because I'm actually getting help like genuinely getting help and like they're not all all

6065
09:13:45,780 --> 09:13:49,700
On to me it's when they all all often there's like nothing I can do hold on sorry

6066
09:13:50,500 --> 09:13:52,420
Because I'm too busy

6067
09:13:52,420 --> 09:13:54,420
freezing the game for not being absolutely

6068
09:13:55,540 --> 09:13:57,540
I take it back

6069
09:14:04,100 --> 09:14:08,940
Why do you fill out your pistols every time why do you insist on filling out the pistols?

6070
09:14:09,820 --> 09:14:12,180
Well, I hope it didn't die because of that freaking cutscene

6071
09:14:12,980 --> 09:14:14,500
Oh

6072
09:14:14,500 --> 09:14:20,580
Is mercy up by the way, I think mercy may be alive. I may have completely missed it during my reach

6073
09:14:22,820 --> 09:14:24,820
Oh

6074
09:14:42,500 --> 09:14:44,500
Oh

6075
09:14:50,420 --> 09:14:57,060
Okay, no, so they are still attacking whatever but I mean I'm getting left them own devices. I'll take it

6076
09:15:01,940 --> 09:15:08,980
Danger danger danger high voltage. Okay. Mercy is live. Yes. Uh, monster. Welcome to link her. We will redirect into her

6077
09:15:08,980 --> 09:15:13,300
I think we're almost done. I am going for a nap after this stream. I can tell you that much

6078
09:15:16,260 --> 09:15:18,020
Wow

6079
09:15:18,020 --> 09:15:23,060
Mercy's region. Yeah, if you want it, I don't know you'll need to see who reaches more me or mercy

6080
09:15:26,100 --> 09:15:28,100
Oh, I'm done

6081
09:15:28,900 --> 09:15:30,900
I can sense it

6082
09:15:31,220 --> 09:15:33,700
I'm licking the screen right now

6083
09:15:34,660 --> 09:15:36,660
Almost done

6084
09:15:37,060 --> 09:15:40,420
You know, that's what I'm talking about now. We can take it to the room

6085
09:15:42,260 --> 09:15:44,260
You need more than enough

6086
09:15:46,260 --> 09:15:50,660
One reach stream to the next return to your dragon and fly to the well of souls. We've done it

6087
09:15:52,420 --> 09:15:58,580
The evil has been defeated. I will never I'm very happy to say I will never play the rda side again

6088
09:15:59,620 --> 09:16:02,420
Oh, uh a rank rotten experience

6089
09:16:03,380 --> 09:16:08,180
Dev team do not speak ever again and do not cook ever again

6090
09:16:10,260 --> 09:16:13,540
Thank you and good night. That's my review

6091
09:16:18,500 --> 09:16:21,220
Forward a little to the right

6092
09:16:24,980 --> 09:16:32,340
The gamer region real I was just it was just rinse and repeat rinse and repeat in the moment. I've got even uh

6093
09:16:32,740 --> 09:16:39,620
A hint of damage a lick of damage to speed things up. Uh, either new guys were brought in

6094
09:16:48,900 --> 09:16:50,740
Oh, it is I actually have a health bar just

6095
09:16:51,860 --> 09:16:55,940
Definitely shouldn't be taking these corners too willy-nilly then

6096
09:16:56,740 --> 09:17:04,420
I'm gonna start showing you but I can't help but find out whole when you're angry. Oh my god. I feel like that would be terrifying

6097
09:17:09,540 --> 09:17:13,780
I'm making that PP shrivel up and go back and save me. I'm just gonna be terrified

6098
09:17:14,820 --> 09:17:16,820
If I was on the receiving end of that

6099
09:17:20,020 --> 09:17:22,420
Same here it's kind of what no

6100
09:17:23,380 --> 09:17:26,020
Oh, my god. Sorry. Sorry women moments

6101
09:17:27,220 --> 09:17:29,220
Looks partners bad boy

6102
09:17:33,060 --> 09:17:37,780
Right we did it we have confirmed the evil

6103
09:17:39,620 --> 09:17:43,460
Is the game gonna let us get there without being attacked by a plan

6104
09:17:44,100 --> 09:17:46,100
Oh

6105
09:17:47,700 --> 09:17:54,100
No fighting here or I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna angry spot is more. I'm sorry so but terrifies mommy

6106
09:17:58,260 --> 09:18:00,260
Right oh

6107
09:18:03,780 --> 09:18:05,780
Oh

6108
09:18:05,780 --> 09:18:07,780
Oh

6109
09:18:12,020 --> 09:18:14,020
I'm going

6110
09:18:14,420 --> 09:18:16,020
Listen to you

6111
09:18:16,020 --> 09:18:20,340
The new recruit fresh from earth. I've been working on this for over 10 years

6112
09:18:20,500 --> 09:18:23,620
This is my moment right now. So if it doesn't work

6113
09:18:24,260 --> 09:18:28,180
I'll see you on the other side. Oh wait. I have to I need to end him anyway

6114
09:18:31,300 --> 09:18:33,300
Oh

6115
09:18:34,260 --> 09:18:38,340
Well, this is gonna be beautifully satisfying

6116
09:18:41,620 --> 09:18:44,980
Just let me cook a bit. Okay. It's fine. He has a belly. He's allowed him

6117
09:18:44,980 --> 09:18:51,860
But yeah, it's just gonna be satisfying all things considered. Actually, you know what I could probably put on that double aggression thing

6118
09:18:53,540 --> 09:18:56,100
Preserver. Yeah, let's do that

6119
09:18:58,820 --> 09:19:00,820
Okay, that's fine

6120
09:19:01,780 --> 09:19:03,780
Oh, he healed up

6121
09:19:05,700 --> 09:19:09,380
I'm not sure I can send it to you healing up. So don't do that again

6122
09:19:13,780 --> 09:19:16,420
Okay, I kind of like some walking and more I'm not gonna lie

6123
09:19:18,980 --> 09:19:23,460
That's okay. He doesn't really seem to do anything. It seems like he blows

6124
09:19:30,820 --> 09:19:32,820
Hmm

6125
09:19:40,260 --> 09:19:43,700
I'm just giving him it. I'm just throwing everything out. I'm hold on a minute

6126
09:19:46,820 --> 09:19:51,860
Oh, wow, so the sonic pulse is too far away none. Okay, he's full healed again

6127
09:19:54,900 --> 09:19:59,460
Now sadly I am going to run out of ammo doing this method

6128
09:20:00,420 --> 09:20:04,500
So not really sure what's supposed to happen

6129
09:20:07,860 --> 09:20:12,420
It's fine you're allowed to do that, but maybe don't heal again

6130
09:20:15,540 --> 09:20:17,540
Um

6131
09:20:20,020 --> 09:20:24,180
Um, am I supposed to do something special for this fight?

6132
09:20:30,420 --> 09:20:35,780
I don't know how many heals you get. If you get like five and then the game's like, okay, no more heals for you

6133
09:20:36,020 --> 09:20:38,020
Well, why did the aim do it?

6134
09:20:43,540 --> 09:20:53,300
Uh, is there like a ammo station? There was one back there. Uh, I'm literally out other than my shorty

6135
09:20:59,460 --> 09:21:01,460
Oh

6136
09:21:13,460 --> 09:21:18,500
I'm not like mad at this fight or anything, but like bro you keep healing like there's nothing I can do

6137
09:21:20,980 --> 09:21:22,980
I don't like

6138
09:21:30,420 --> 09:21:32,420
You use my mortar strike on him

6139
09:21:48,340 --> 09:21:50,340
I did nothing to him

6140
09:21:52,020 --> 09:21:54,020
Hello

6141
09:21:55,780 --> 09:21:57,780
Um

6142
09:21:59,700 --> 09:22:04,740
I'm a bit confused. Sorry. I need to change out my weapons because they're all empty. So I can't

6143
09:22:05,460 --> 09:22:07,460
the nail gun sure

6144
09:22:08,180 --> 09:22:11,620
Uh, it's already full me and there's no point in making it at flame doors or

6145
09:22:14,020 --> 09:22:19,380
Uh, machine gun? I don't know. Okay. Oh, this one's different

6146
09:22:24,100 --> 09:22:26,100
Okay, nail gun again

6147
09:22:27,060 --> 09:22:29,060
All right, healed again

6148
09:22:31,460 --> 09:22:34,900
I don't know if I'm supposed to call upon Awa to do something

6149
09:22:37,700 --> 09:22:41,540
The utility looks like it's less literally sneaking on. I guess he's just a damage on

6150
09:22:42,660 --> 09:22:44,660
Wait, just go to the glowing thing

6151
09:22:45,380 --> 09:22:47,380
The thing back here

6152
09:22:47,780 --> 09:22:49,780
No, it's a bit of a glowing thing

6153
09:22:50,020 --> 09:22:52,020
I'm

6154
09:22:52,340 --> 09:22:54,020
Blowing

6155
09:22:54,020 --> 09:22:56,020
Sorry, I'm brain

6156
09:22:56,500 --> 09:22:58,980
I'm both brain dead. I'm bling bling thing

6157
09:23:00,100 --> 09:23:01,940
I'm looking

6158
09:23:01,940 --> 09:23:06,340
But yeah, I'm starting to think I'm needing to like call upon Awa to like end him because

6159
09:23:07,140 --> 09:23:12,820
I'm literally like swimming right now. Excuse me. I tried to go for a wee swim before I ended you

6160
09:23:14,740 --> 09:23:16,740
I'm just gonna like up on Awa. Oops. Sorry

6161
09:23:16,820 --> 09:23:18,820
Oh

6162
09:23:19,060 --> 09:23:21,060
Blowing

6163
09:23:23,460 --> 09:23:26,660
I'm definitely not to claim Awa right now glowing

6164
09:23:31,780 --> 09:23:35,380
I thought that stick. I mean that stick is glowing. What the fuck it is

6165
09:23:36,100 --> 09:23:38,100
I

6166
09:23:42,260 --> 09:23:47,220
Warning de synchronization imminent honestly, can you bring him to a ledge?

6167
09:23:51,220 --> 09:23:53,380
I feel like I'm supposed to do something here

6168
09:23:59,300 --> 09:24:02,500
I think it's broke. Okay, so I watched a quick video and the guy

6169
09:24:03,460 --> 09:24:07,460
He uses a green angel. Oh greening greening launcher. Okay

6170
09:24:10,660 --> 09:24:15,140
Is this a grenade launcher? I only have 20 on the grenade

6171
09:24:18,500 --> 09:24:20,500
Oh

6172
09:24:21,620 --> 09:24:27,780
Oh, wow, really? Okay after all of that bro

6173
09:24:27,860 --> 09:24:34,980
I'm starting to think this shit wasn't playtested at all past this point

6174
09:24:54,180 --> 09:24:56,180
Are we the baddies

6175
09:24:57,780 --> 09:24:59,780
All right

6176
09:25:06,100 --> 09:25:08,980
Um, yeah, let's see where the baddies all right

6177
09:25:12,900 --> 09:25:14,900
Ryder you there colonel quarch

6178
09:25:15,380 --> 09:25:20,020
Analyst is going like a baseball stadium. What the hell did you do? I'm not sure

6179
09:25:20,260 --> 09:25:26,580
Whatever you did it worked, but now we are making a quick retreat. I'm getting reports. They lost control of their band cheese

6180
09:25:26,820 --> 09:25:28,820
That makes sense to you. Yeah

6181
09:25:28,900 --> 09:25:30,260
It actually does

6182
09:25:30,260 --> 09:25:32,660
Congrats Ryder. You're gonna be a hero for this

6183
09:25:33,300 --> 09:25:37,860
I'll get your butt down here and that dragon better be spotless. He had damage on the dragon

6184
09:25:38,900 --> 09:25:44,980
Eat that you grace. I heard we lost Kendra, but you need to know you did the right thing

6185
09:25:45,700 --> 09:25:47,700
I hope it was all right

6186
09:25:48,020 --> 09:25:51,140
This better bring peace. You've stopped a catastrophe, but this isn't over

6187
09:25:51,700 --> 09:25:56,500
We can't keep control available for long nor should we and we've got more shit

6188
09:25:56,580 --> 09:25:58,580
of humans do to arrive

6189
09:25:58,980 --> 09:26:01,300
More is inevitable. So what was this all for?

6190
09:26:01,860 --> 09:26:06,500
A we needed to see what we're not there being part two spoilers from the movie in the video game

6191
09:26:06,900 --> 09:26:08,900
Next time she'll be ready

6192
09:26:10,980 --> 09:26:12,980
Am I here

6193
09:26:16,580 --> 09:26:19,940
Development team should be ashamed of yourself for the rda side

6194
09:26:20,580 --> 09:26:26,020
Development team should be proud of yourselves from the navi side. Don't ever make me do that again. That's awful

6195
09:26:27,060 --> 09:26:29,060
Oh my god

6196
09:26:30,980 --> 09:26:34,260
I have no idea how hard I reach because I can't remember in the moment

6197
09:26:35,300 --> 09:26:37,300
But oh my god

6198
09:26:38,820 --> 09:26:41,460
Am I going mental or was that terrible?

6199
09:26:43,620 --> 09:26:48,820
I think I must have I think I should have been using the grenade launcher clearly from that last fight

6200
09:26:49,380 --> 09:26:52,100
and and because I didn't use the grenade launcher

6201
09:26:53,220 --> 09:26:54,900
and

6202
09:26:54,980 --> 09:26:57,780
It just got from like bad to worse or

6203
09:26:58,500 --> 09:27:03,220
You blacked out when you raised. I don't remember really what I just remember like I did get angry

6204
09:27:03,780 --> 09:27:07,380
But I don't remember anything that actually happened like one minute

6205
09:27:07,380 --> 09:27:12,980
I was like getting annoyed and then the next minute the fight was over and I got stuck on a rock and I was trying to get down

6206
09:27:16,020 --> 09:27:20,260
A grenade launcher is op. Okay, I guess that's probably you're shouting quite a bit

6207
09:27:21,060 --> 09:27:23,060
I'm cheeky. Bye

6208
09:27:23,380 --> 09:27:30,020
She literally saw red. Honestly. It was beautiful. Monka is you're rage is hot, but the mission was bad

6209
09:27:31,700 --> 09:27:37,700
Angry girl, you were fuming at the man. I was frothing for mama. I clipped it. So show up one stream and it's Monka

6210
09:27:37,780 --> 09:27:42,260
I don't even know. Am I going to be embarrassed if I look back on it like I don't feel that bad right now

6211
09:27:42,420 --> 09:27:44,420
So kind of been that bad

6212
09:27:45,380 --> 09:27:51,060
The game got dunked on hard and forgotten pretty quickly, but for the general community for a lot of good reasons

6213
09:27:53,460 --> 09:27:58,020
At least you finished it. You deserve a good rest. Good girl. I'm proud of you for not driving up

6214
09:27:58,420 --> 09:28:05,060
The rage has talked to your content. Well, that is literally why I do not play rage games like mercies unironically so brave

6215
09:28:05,780 --> 09:28:09,380
For playing that game. Like I couldn't I'd just be scurrying and

6216
09:28:10,340 --> 09:28:16,020
It may be a bit embarrassing, but at least it seems to have been for a good reason. I felt that rage. It's so funny

6217
09:28:16,740 --> 09:28:20,820
Also, you might want to make more tea before sleeping or after waking up or for my voice

6218
09:28:22,020 --> 09:28:26,820
I mean, it felt like a justifiable rage or he just won't make us cause the rage was justified. Okay

6219
09:28:27,380 --> 09:28:29,380
Congrats. You did good job thing

6220
09:28:30,100 --> 09:28:35,220
So you need more than an app. You may need to fill it. Oh, I hope I can get like a full eight hours. I've been needing it for a while

6221
09:28:36,180 --> 09:28:40,420
Hmm, you didn't give up. So you did a good job at least. Heck yeah

6222
09:28:41,860 --> 09:28:48,420
Mad cause bad. Lamar true. Literally all I had to do was pull out the grinny launcher

6223
09:28:49,460 --> 09:28:51,460
apparently

6224
09:28:51,860 --> 09:28:53,620
Lucky me

6225
09:28:53,620 --> 09:28:55,620
Lucky me. All I had to do was pull it

6226
09:28:56,900 --> 09:28:58,900
Take these head pads

6227
09:28:59,460 --> 09:29:01,460
I would have went insane. You're amazing

6228
09:29:02,180 --> 09:29:07,700
Well, then I feel like you guys probably would have figured out to swap to the weapon way before I did so

6229
09:29:08,580 --> 09:29:12,260
Sending hugs if they're welcome. Otherwise you did so good. I'll take those hugs

6230
09:29:13,220 --> 09:29:16,020
Are you the first person to finish this campaign on stream?

6231
09:29:16,500 --> 09:29:20,660
Stop imagine if I was like the first vtuber to play this game. That would be hilarious

6232
09:29:21,460 --> 09:29:27,940
And and the pov is like isn't the navi side amazing and then the rd side is me just screaming

6233
09:29:27,940 --> 09:29:33,220
Sorry for forcing you to play that. I feel bad now. Nah, come on. I can stop at any time

6234
09:29:34,980 --> 09:29:37,700
I just say stilettos and then I would stop. Don't worry

6235
09:29:38,660 --> 09:29:44,100
If you're the first that counts as a world record, I would have thrown my monitor before changing weapons

6236
09:29:44,740 --> 09:29:46,740
making vtuber history

6237
09:29:47,300 --> 09:29:52,260
So when an angry scot rages. Oh, so wins the angry scotch rages somewhere on

6238
09:29:52,260 --> 09:29:54,260
the floor

6239
09:29:54,580 --> 09:30:01,940
I'm pretty sure you are though. Oh, no, I'm what sorry. I've already I've already forgotten what I'm probably would have overgranted

6240
09:30:03,460 --> 09:30:08,580
Before and killed it with a bigger number. You're probably the only one that ever will you can be the avatar of youtuber

6241
09:30:10,020 --> 09:30:12,500
The way of the water the way of the scot

6242
09:30:14,100 --> 09:30:19,940
You did great powering through that heck. Yeah, think about it. You used the worst weapon to beat the game. Honestly

6243
09:30:20,820 --> 09:30:24,580
I actually think you are the first vtuber to do answer every shipper history

6244
09:30:24,660 --> 09:30:27,620
Not even a weekend after debut and i'm already making history

6245
09:30:28,180 --> 09:30:30,900
But see fully the rda was a lot more fun than the navi

6246
09:30:31,140 --> 09:30:36,980
Why because of the rage apparently everyone's got you know, half masked at the moment because they liked my rage

6247
09:30:38,500 --> 09:30:41,780
The way of the scot the cut fish the way school and

6248
09:30:42,900 --> 09:30:47,060
You have a full monopoly on this game now. Okay. Okay. I'll take it. I'll take it

6249
09:30:48,020 --> 09:30:51,220
I'm the type to pause the game and watch a video spin feeding me on what to do

6250
09:30:51,540 --> 09:30:55,060
Honestly small streamer did two years ago, but for both campaigns. Yes

6251
09:30:56,340 --> 09:30:58,340
half half

6252
09:30:58,500 --> 09:31:02,820
Now i'm going to get the game to relieve or to relive the pain

6253
09:31:03,620 --> 09:31:05,620
You can't me

6254
09:31:06,500 --> 09:31:11,540
Yeah, let's say half only half wait, there's no way i'll need to make a rage ASMR if that's okay

6255
09:31:12,420 --> 09:31:14,420
I don't mean suffering like that

6256
09:31:14,660 --> 09:31:18,500
Like honestly, I feel fine now, but I guess in the moment. I was like scary region

6257
09:31:20,100 --> 09:31:23,140
Sorry if I scared anyone. I apologize

6258
09:31:24,660 --> 09:31:28,020
Got some ancestral rage build up in me, I guess

6259
09:31:31,780 --> 09:31:34,740
Me just skipping 60 percent past all the enemies honestly

6260
09:31:35,620 --> 09:31:39,540
60 percent probably like 100 percent of the optional fights i skipped like i'm not even kidding

6261
09:31:39,860 --> 09:31:41,860
Now you scare us more. No, you didn't scare

6262
09:31:43,460 --> 09:31:46,420
You could do it more. You're like, well, I do have a

6263
09:31:47,940 --> 09:31:51,780
Donut's lawn reward potentially being that rage, but yeah

6264
09:31:52,900 --> 09:31:57,780
Stormy rage should be like you call that a willy. That's just prophetic, you know

6265
09:32:00,900 --> 09:32:05,380
That was uh, that wasn't scary. It was the opposite. Oh the fabled Scottish rage

6266
09:32:05,700 --> 09:32:11,140
I mean, I was scared and felt something else at the same time. I'm not gonna explain. That's actually hilarious

6267
09:32:11,620 --> 09:32:15,700
I didn't know that had that effect. It makes me remember the banshee scream. Oh

6268
09:32:17,380 --> 09:32:19,380
I'm not sure I can even banshee scream

6269
09:32:19,620 --> 09:32:24,340
Like I can do it. Like my screams very loud, but I'm not gonna scream because I

6270
09:32:24,980 --> 09:32:29,540
I think after the rage, I don't know if one of the neighbors will probably try to listen in on me right now

6271
09:32:29,780 --> 09:32:31,780
And be like what is going on

6272
09:32:32,900 --> 09:32:34,900
Angry hypnosis ASMR

6273
09:32:35,060 --> 09:32:39,620
Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. Get hypnotized. I still prefer subspace

6274
09:32:42,500 --> 09:32:44,500
Just yelling get up

6275
09:32:47,140 --> 09:32:53,220
Right, um, they're gonna call the police on you. I've actually wondered if it's a possibility

6276
09:32:53,780 --> 09:32:57,540
I did speak to my neighbors at one point

6277
09:32:58,660 --> 09:33:01,620
And I explained to them that i'm a voice actress

6278
09:33:02,260 --> 09:33:06,500
So if they hear anything at night, don't be too worried. It's just me

6279
09:33:09,620 --> 09:33:12,500
So my voice acting's a bit different

6280
09:33:13,700 --> 09:33:19,140
Um, can you make a reward that you just scream Scotland forever Scotland forever

6281
09:33:19,780 --> 09:33:24,820
Passive aggressive ASMR guys. They're like, is she okay in there? Does she need help?

6282
09:33:26,340 --> 09:33:29,620
If someone clip that moment the clip will get but will get pretty

6283
09:33:31,780 --> 09:33:34,820
Oh the toothbrushing I'm gonna go get my toothbrush. Okay

6284
09:33:36,260 --> 09:33:39,540
I'll be right back. We're gonna if you want to get your toothbrush and brush your teeth

6285
09:33:40,100 --> 09:33:42,600
Before we go off-stream you can most certainly do it

6286
09:34:01,620 --> 09:34:03,620
I

6287
09:34:21,380 --> 09:34:23,540
Got one out of 21 days to brush our teeth

6288
09:34:24,820 --> 09:34:26,900
Like let me put my headset on so I can listen to the

6289
09:34:27,620 --> 09:34:32,820
Thingy right. I've got my toothbrush. It could be a sound pack from morning alarms. Just full bag pouch

6290
09:34:35,300 --> 09:34:38,500
I have toothpaste because I salivate a lot. I don't know about you

6291
09:34:38,580 --> 09:34:41,700
But whenever something enters my mouth, it starts to salivate like crazy

6292
09:34:41,940 --> 09:34:44,260
We're gonna brush our teeth and then we'll read into

6293
09:34:45,540 --> 09:34:49,460
Yeah, mercy. I was gonna call her mousy for a second. What she ate a mouse?

6294
09:34:50,900 --> 09:34:52,900
Are you ready?

6295
09:34:52,900 --> 09:34:54,900
Are you ready to brush your teethies

6296
09:34:55,380 --> 09:34:56,740
With me

6297
09:34:56,740 --> 09:34:59,860
I'm gonna do it for two minutes. Okay. That's how long you brush your teeth

6298
09:34:59,940 --> 09:35:02,660
So just start with the front of your teeth, right?

6299
09:35:03,380 --> 09:35:07,780
I see you. I do you want me to mute the game so you can like really hear the brushy brush

6300
09:35:09,380 --> 09:35:11,380
Yeah

6301
09:35:11,780 --> 09:35:17,140
I don't think you're gonna hear it over the thing. No, I will start a two minute counter now

6302
09:35:18,580 --> 09:35:21,860
Uh, oh, yeah, sorry. Let me mute the game

6303
09:35:22,820 --> 09:35:27,220
I was probably gonna break now that I'm out and it's tabbed out the game. There we go

6304
09:35:28,340 --> 09:35:30,900
Do you have a chatting? I do have chatting. Hold on

6305
09:35:32,100 --> 09:35:35,940
Uh, whoa, that's a lot of words to speed up one. Hold on

6306
09:35:37,540 --> 09:35:42,740
Uh, I got sorry. I've got toothpaste on my mouth right now. Pardon me. One second one second

6307
09:35:43,220 --> 09:35:45,220
I will do that and I do this

6308
09:35:47,140 --> 09:35:49,700
Okay, we're brushing our teethies

6309
09:35:52,740 --> 09:35:54,740
Hmm

6310
09:35:55,060 --> 09:35:57,940
Okay, two minutes of teeth brushing is a lot

6311
09:36:00,420 --> 09:36:05,140
Oh, no, you can hear my background music shift back my music you're ruining it. Uh

6312
09:36:09,220 --> 09:36:13,380
Wait two minutes so um 39 minutes past

6313
09:36:17,220 --> 09:36:19,220
Wait make sure you do the outside first

6314
09:36:19,540 --> 09:36:26,980
Oh my god, my shoe floor is quite all ready. Um, I don't think this is enough product paper

6315
09:36:37,460 --> 09:36:43,140
Okay, now the bed that most people mess I'm spitting everywhere. Hold on. I need more

6316
09:36:43,300 --> 09:36:45,540
Does that have a pillow in this room? I don't

6317
09:36:46,660 --> 09:36:48,980
I have so much saliva coming out of my mouth

6318
09:36:53,220 --> 09:36:59,540
Do the back of your front teeth and the back of your front bottom teeth that's the most forgotten science when you brush your teeth, okay?

6319
09:37:06,180 --> 09:37:08,180
I'll go cook some tea

6320
09:37:13,460 --> 09:37:15,460
I

6321
09:37:16,980 --> 09:37:21,860
We get no cavities over here. We get no how you call them

6322
09:37:22,580 --> 09:37:24,100
uh

6323
09:37:24,100 --> 09:37:28,100
What what are you called haemorrhoids? No haemorrhoids. No cavities

6324
09:37:29,460 --> 09:37:31,460
We are good with things

6325
09:37:32,180 --> 09:37:34,260
and we go that

6326
09:37:34,260 --> 09:37:36,820
Don't brush too hard on your gondola. We're free. I don't

6327
09:37:37,860 --> 09:37:41,060
No root canals. We don't believe in root canals in this house

6328
09:37:42,020 --> 09:37:44,020
root canal blood

6329
09:37:46,820 --> 09:37:50,500
Haemorrhoids, yeah, we don't have haemorrhoids in this community

6330
09:37:55,860 --> 09:38:00,420
Uh, I can't pull off because I don't know about the foster but we're just gonna brush our teeth in general

6331
09:38:01,220 --> 09:38:03,940
and we're gonna do it for quite one day in a row

6332
09:38:04,900 --> 09:38:06,660
and then

6333
09:38:06,660 --> 09:38:15,300
Everyone's gonna have a teeth brush and have it, okay? And life is nice and easy. Oh my god. This bit is going over the paper towel. Well, it's not on a toilet roll, but uh

6334
09:38:19,380 --> 09:38:21,620
Get the back of your wisdom tooth for you still got them

6335
09:38:24,260 --> 09:38:26,980
No, not mouth haemorrhoids booty haemorrhoids

6336
09:38:28,100 --> 09:38:34,180
Okay, and make sure you do circular motions. That's how you get all the the peas and poos off your teeth

6337
09:38:37,300 --> 09:38:40,020
Mm-hmm. Okay. I think I'm almost done

6338
09:38:45,780 --> 09:38:50,500
Is there a toothbrush out for a retailer? No, no, I don't brush in our teeth

6339
09:38:52,660 --> 09:38:55,620
Yeah, we're getting the because we didn't know

6340
09:38:57,700 --> 09:39:02,500
The reason why hold on I need to spit I'm gonna spit into my little mcdonald

6341
09:39:03,460 --> 09:39:05,780
Uh, crazy. Are you ready here there?

6342
09:39:09,140 --> 09:39:12,740
That's so much spit. I didn't need to generate that much, but I did

6343
09:39:17,940 --> 09:39:19,940
So minty

6344
09:39:22,740 --> 09:39:28,420
We did it. We have established day one of a 21 day habit of brushing our teeth

6345
09:39:29,380 --> 09:39:33,940
Thank you for the drink. No, not my used toothpaste, but

6346
09:39:38,260 --> 09:39:41,940
The only thing I don't like about toothpaste is that it keeps sitting

6347
09:39:42,900 --> 09:39:47,460
Like it keeps in your you're not to you're not to rinse that way, but if you need to spit it out like

6348
09:39:47,860 --> 09:39:49,860
Yeah

6349
09:39:53,940 --> 09:39:55,460
Okay

6350
09:39:55,460 --> 09:39:58,900
Did it we played the world's most annoying game

6351
09:40:00,500 --> 09:40:04,020
Right, I'm going to make triple sure I am redirecting into mary

6352
09:40:05,860 --> 09:40:08,600
Oh, I just minimized the tab by accident

6353
09:40:10,420 --> 09:40:12,420
Oh, I'm all docky too

6354
09:40:12,420 --> 09:40:17,060
No, that's mersey's umari stream

6355
09:40:19,940 --> 09:40:23,700
Stony cuttage a bit of stony cuttage

6356
09:40:25,060 --> 09:40:29,860
Thanks for the stream. You're most welcome. Thanks for hanging. Sorry for scared anyone to do apologize, but that

6357
09:40:30,580 --> 09:40:35,380
Sorry about that old chap didn't really mean to scare you did I? Oh, but just kind of came out

6358
09:40:36,340 --> 09:40:38,340
Kind of just came out

6359
09:40:38,580 --> 09:40:40,820
I said what everyone was thinking and saying

6360
09:40:41,780 --> 09:40:45,460
But uh, yeah, that game needs a hot patch for weapon drill. That's all I'm saying

6361
09:40:47,380 --> 09:40:51,380
It won't let me open the redirect thing. Why not?

6362
09:40:53,300 --> 09:40:59,140
YouTube you're so stinky sometimes it won't let me load so I can redirect into mary. I need to wait for it to load

6363
09:40:59,380 --> 09:41:01,380
Okay, I did it now

6364
09:41:01,780 --> 09:41:06,260
Oh tomorrow we have old school runesgate. Oh, I need to make my account

6365
09:41:06,660 --> 09:41:09,460
But what do I call my account is the question?

6366
09:41:11,780 --> 09:41:12,840
my

6367
09:41:12,840 --> 09:41:14,140
meaning

6368
09:41:14,140 --> 09:41:17,060
customization redirect add

6369
09:41:18,980 --> 09:41:22,260
A difficulty right into mersey say

6370
09:41:23,540 --> 09:41:25,540
Mersey

6371
09:41:27,300 --> 09:41:29,300
Good better work

6372
09:41:31,540 --> 09:41:33,540
Because

6373
09:41:34,100 --> 09:41:40,180
Right my little reeflings. I honestly didn't think we were gonna. I honestly thought we're going to end out four hours

6374
09:41:40,180 --> 09:41:46,020
but we've made it to almost 10 hours! Look at us go. You guys have so much stamina.

6375
09:41:47,780 --> 09:41:51,540
Wait, wait, can I try this out? Hold on, I don't know if I can try this out right now.

6376
09:41:52,180 --> 09:41:54,100
Is this gonna work or is this gonna break?

6377
09:42:00,660 --> 09:42:05,060
You did so well. You make me so proud.

6378
09:42:05,220 --> 09:42:12,820
You made such a long, unending stamina for me.

6379
09:42:14,820 --> 09:42:15,460
Did it work?

6380
09:42:19,460 --> 09:42:24,260
Did it work? Did I have a reverb effect when I did that? I don't know if that worked or not,

6381
09:42:24,260 --> 09:42:29,860
or did I mess it up. What do you mean, look at your skull? You're the crazy one who took

6382
09:42:30,820 --> 09:42:35,380
stuff. I'm feeling like it is. Yeah, the reverb was like, yes, it worked. I'm so happy.

6383
09:42:37,220 --> 09:42:40,580
If my voice wasn't so burst, I'd do a bit more, but it's burst right now.

6384
09:42:41,860 --> 09:42:43,460
Big burst, big burst.

6385
09:42:46,260 --> 09:42:47,540
All hail the glowfish.

6386
09:42:49,060 --> 09:42:54,020
It looks good when my eyes and my little shells, you can kind of see the transparency of my

6387
09:42:54,020 --> 09:43:03,460
shells a bit better like this. Maybe you can see my reflective thing going on. It works, so

6388
09:43:04,340 --> 09:43:10,900
wait, talk a bit. Okay, I'm glad it worked. Right, I am going to end it there without a

6389
09:43:10,900 --> 09:43:17,380
fantastic endurance room. Tomorrow is old-school runescape, so just so you know the plan, the plan

6390
09:43:17,380 --> 09:43:28,260
is that I'm going to make a new fresh account. You don't have to, but my idea was that we do

6391
09:43:28,260 --> 09:43:35,940
some questing to level up, and then we basically just have fun leveling up cooking and see where

6392
09:43:35,940 --> 09:43:44,740
it goes. But I'm a bit rubbish at quests, so it would be nice to try them together, like Cook's

6393
09:43:44,740 --> 09:43:53,060
Assistant. I'm sure there's a Vam, that haunted house quest. I can't remember its name right now,

6394
09:43:53,060 --> 09:44:01,780
but we're going to do those kind of questings, and then we can do some fishing together, and we'll

6395
09:44:01,780 --> 09:44:10,740
cook the fish outside of the barbarian village, because that's free, and we can cook crayfish for

6396
09:44:11,060 --> 09:44:17,380
free. I'm pretty sure you just need to get a net. Are you doing members? I think so, that's my only

6397
09:44:17,380 --> 09:44:22,820
issue. I'm going to buy membership, but I'll play, like I'll go into a free-to-play lobby, and we can

6398
09:44:22,820 --> 09:44:31,460
do the free-to-play quests, and take it from there, because I'm not entirely sure what the plan is after

6399
09:44:32,180 --> 09:44:40,020
that. I joined you on old-school RuneScape Sheebie. I hate to break it to you, my name's

6400
09:44:40,020 --> 09:44:51,540
Ronnie. My own tags level drain hypnosis. Yes, RuneScape membership. Time to make my account

6401
09:44:51,540 --> 09:44:56,980
tonight too. Yes, I'll share whatever we're on, and we can all go questing together, and we can

6402
09:44:56,980 --> 09:45:01,460
see all the reefling gang gang. I'm tired, it's pain. I know, I know what you meant. I need to go

6403
09:45:01,460 --> 09:45:09,220
sleep. The fangs are so much easier to admire this school. Yeah. Some people thought they were

6404
09:45:09,220 --> 09:45:15,460
vampire fangs, but they're not. You can't really see my ears, but they're slightly pointed. No,

6405
09:45:15,460 --> 09:45:22,100
pointy ears. I haven't played in ages, I need to learn. Yeah, we can all get like the same level.

6406
09:45:22,100 --> 09:45:27,620
We can all like hack the same yew tree when we're trying to level up our woodcraft.

6407
09:45:28,420 --> 09:45:33,300
Are you planning on playing something that follows 76? I think that's multiplayer,

6408
09:45:33,300 --> 09:45:37,780
but I don't know how to get you in my lobby. Like, how do I get reeflings in the lobby?

6409
09:45:37,780 --> 09:45:44,740
Or is it like, can we make a lobby code, and it's like a server like they host? I'm not sure how 76

6410
09:45:44,820 --> 09:45:55,620
works. Get bit by the fish, you wonder why? Would you let me bite you, reefling? That's terrible,

6411
09:45:57,380 --> 09:46:03,300
you should let me do it. Love your choice of games so far makes me safe to see where else you got

6412
09:46:03,300 --> 09:46:08,660
blood. Well, I'm glad you like the game so far. I'm literally just picking childhood stuff and

6413
09:46:08,660 --> 09:46:15,220
stuff that makes me happy. So I'm glad. But yes, old school RuneScape definitely

6414
09:46:15,940 --> 09:46:22,420
might be a recurring multiplayer for a little bit. I'm not really gonna, I'm not sure what happens

6415
09:46:22,420 --> 09:46:29,780
when membership, what membership streams are planned. I think we'll also do, I think three

6416
09:46:29,780 --> 09:46:39,060
membership streams a week possibly. One for react movie, one for membership

6417
09:46:41,140 --> 09:46:48,260
multiplayer. I'll decide. Like, I wouldn't do like progression on old school RuneScape

6418
09:46:48,260 --> 09:46:54,980
multiplayer behind a membership stream because that's not fair for those invested. So maybe,

6419
09:46:55,140 --> 09:47:06,100
maybe, maybe. I first played again yesterday for the first time, used old school RuneScape,

6420
09:47:06,100 --> 09:47:11,460
and a goblin got you, you got done at Goblin Village. A Dead by Daylight member stream? Yeah,

6421
09:47:12,580 --> 09:47:18,660
I'm open to these kind of things. But yeah, one, I want to consistently have a member stream

6422
09:47:18,900 --> 09:47:29,860
when membership's open. A react Andy, like we'll watch a movie together. And then I might also do

6423
09:47:29,860 --> 09:47:35,940
a script writing stream. Or maybe show you some behind the scenes stuff, like maybe we write

6424
09:47:35,940 --> 09:47:40,100
shorts. I don't know. I'm trying to think of like stuff you guys want to see. And then of course,

6425
09:47:40,100 --> 09:47:47,220
we could just like maybe smaller games that aren't necessarily stream worthy on main. So for those of

6426
09:47:47,220 --> 09:47:54,340
you who are unable to membership, please don't worry. I always have free content coming out and I

6427
09:47:55,140 --> 09:48:00,500
for days, like so you know how we played needy streamer overload yesterday? Because it was only

6428
09:48:00,500 --> 09:48:06,340
two hours long, like that's a short game. I would then come back online after maybe like a 30 minute

6429
09:48:06,340 --> 09:48:11,220
rest and then do a membership stream. So you still get like content that day and then like I'll raid

6430
09:48:11,220 --> 09:48:19,140
into whoever's online and like keep going. So yeah, don't worry. She streams eight days a week.

6431
09:48:20,180 --> 09:48:25,540
Yeah, don't ever worry. And like obviously the ASMR comes out as well. That's like free on YouTube.

6432
09:48:25,540 --> 09:48:33,700
You can watch on YouTube anytime. Script writing stream or submit scripts? Yes, it would be a bit

6433
09:48:33,700 --> 09:48:41,460
hard to review scripts live because I would need to use euphemism and stuff. That's nice as long

6434
09:48:41,460 --> 09:48:47,620
as you're not overworking yourself. I will make what I can handle and we can take it from there.

6435
09:48:48,820 --> 09:48:56,580
Yeah. Get that Hermione to rewind time and overlap herself streaming honestly.

6436
09:48:56,820 --> 09:49:04,740
True. True. I'll need to see eventually you'll be able to close your eyes and see her for a moment

6437
09:49:04,740 --> 09:49:12,340
and you're out watching. Yeah. Always on that. There are always streams. So yes, please never worry

6438
09:49:12,340 --> 09:49:16,900
if you don't have the money for membership because I stream every day and you can come see me every

6439
09:49:16,900 --> 09:49:26,180
day. And yeah, I'll make sure everyone gets their money's worth either way because I don't like

6440
09:49:26,180 --> 09:49:31,060
when streamers don't get their money's worth. Sorry, I don't like when streamers don't get their

6441
09:49:31,060 --> 09:49:38,820
money's worth. So that's just me. So yeah. Strony is a streaming beast. I'm sure she'll have something

6442
09:49:38,820 --> 09:49:44,340
for you. Yeah, I've got something for everyone. Or that's the plan anyway. Hopefully I got something

6443
09:49:44,340 --> 09:49:53,060
for everyone. So you're saying is I should never become a member. Only if you are financially

6444
09:49:53,060 --> 09:50:00,660
capable. And if you're only financially capable to support one person, I recommend doing my daughters

6445
09:50:00,660 --> 09:50:10,180
over me. Okay. Because I always have free accessible content. Always coming out. So yeah.

6446
09:50:12,100 --> 09:50:14,420
We love you, Strony. Please don't try my blood bliss.

6447
09:50:15,380 --> 09:50:26,900
Yes. You're such a good girl. I will skip meals to members. Stop. No, we're not doing these jokes.

6448
09:50:26,900 --> 09:50:32,900
I don't actually don't like these. There was like one joke that was like, oh, I'm like in a homeless

6449
09:50:32,900 --> 09:50:38,340
shelter. And then I've given you like membership or whatever. I'm like, no, it's actually probably

6450
09:50:38,740 --> 09:50:45,780
I am like so goofy and non serious all the time. Those kind of jokes are like, I don't like them.

6451
09:50:48,020 --> 09:50:55,940
I sold my kidney. You definitely have a few streams that I need to rewatch. I love it though.

6452
09:50:55,940 --> 09:51:00,900
Oh, they're long streams. You'll be rewatching for a while. But I'm good for putting on in the

6453
09:51:00,900 --> 09:51:05,700
background for a rambling. If you ever like, I need I want to listen to something in the

6454
09:51:05,700 --> 09:51:10,500
background, but I don't want to actually focus in. Yeah, just put the avatar stream on. And then

6455
09:51:10,500 --> 09:51:16,100
when it comes to the RDA part, we're going to start screaming my head off. My, my, my scarier.

6456
09:51:16,100 --> 09:51:21,940
But I'm looking forward to your first asterisk. I hope YouTube doesn't do anything. I'm a bit

6457
09:51:21,940 --> 09:51:26,660
worried, but I'm not going to be doing ear licking or anything like that. I don't know what the heck

6458
09:51:26,660 --> 09:51:32,820
YouTube's been playing at recently. It's making me nervous to even upload my like 1000 rewards.

6459
09:51:32,820 --> 09:51:35,460
And there's literally nothing wrong with that fricking audios.

6460
09:51:36,660 --> 09:51:41,540
Well, I just made a brand new or school roadscape. It's been years and I look forward to it. Yay.

6461
09:51:41,540 --> 09:51:45,860
I will tell everyone the server when we get on tomorrow. Like I'll put it on screen and I'll

6462
09:51:45,860 --> 09:51:51,700
say like, this is the world that we're in. And we'll start outside Lumbridge Castle where the

6463
09:51:51,700 --> 09:51:56,820
starting point is. I'm literally going to make an account, put membership on it and then

6464
09:51:58,100 --> 09:52:02,580
I get online for stream and we'll take it from there. I don't know what to name myself. So I

6465
09:52:02,580 --> 09:52:07,460
need to name myself something mildly humorous, but I haven't decided yet. Maybe Scottlefish.

6466
09:52:07,460 --> 09:52:11,540
That'd be nice. Oh, no, someone, someone. Ah, well, if you take my name, it's fine.

6467
09:52:11,540 --> 09:52:16,580
I don't know. I'll need to think of something. Do you have a place where you'll upload?

6468
09:52:18,420 --> 09:52:22,500
Monies for Vegemite. No, I don't have to try Vegemite.

6469
09:52:24,180 --> 09:52:31,140
I'll get Vegemite then for the hand cam stream. Thank you reluctantly saying I'll get Vegemite

6470
09:52:31,140 --> 09:52:37,060
in freaking toast. I don't even buy bread. I don't even get buy bread. Scottlefish is a good one.

6471
09:52:37,060 --> 09:52:42,340
Thanks. I stole it from a leafling. Thank you for giving me that. Wait,

6472
09:52:42,340 --> 09:52:48,740
do we need a membership on old school runescape too? Not necessarily for what we're going to do,

6473
09:52:48,740 --> 09:52:53,620
but I think if we, I don't know yet. Like I don't know. We're going to do some quests,

6474
09:52:53,620 --> 09:52:58,260
but I'm pretty sure like everything's behind a freaking lock and it's so expensive for old school

6475
09:52:58,260 --> 09:53:02,660
runescape membership. I don't know if maybe there's a rich reefling that's willing to buy

6476
09:53:02,660 --> 09:53:10,740
bonds and gift it to reeflings, but that's not like my place to ask for. It's a bit. I don't

6477
09:53:10,740 --> 09:53:18,020
know if we have any try hard reeflings on old school runescape. Like I think I have about 12,000

6478
09:53:18,020 --> 09:53:25,700
coins in those runescape, so I can't buy anyone a bond. Sorry. And I'm starting on a fresh account.

6479
09:53:25,700 --> 09:53:29,300
I don't know. Maybe we can like pull our money together to buy bonds to like share to reeflings.

6480
09:53:30,340 --> 09:53:33,620
Will there be, you're looking on Patreon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're looking on Patreon.

6481
09:53:33,620 --> 09:53:39,780
It's not a problem for me. Do what we want on Patreon. Do you have a place where you upload

6482
09:53:39,780 --> 09:53:45,620
words that you asked that and I read that out and then I didn't even reply to you? No, well,

6483
09:53:46,740 --> 09:53:51,300
the girls have been using Twitter and like putting a go, like a download link out.

6484
09:53:51,940 --> 09:53:55,460
Um, I don't think any of my content is going to get taken down because

6485
09:53:57,220 --> 09:54:00,740
I know the rules. I know how to scare them.

6486
09:54:03,620 --> 09:54:08,180
Um, so I don't think we're going to any any Oilers in chat, literally any old school runescape

6487
09:54:08,180 --> 09:54:15,860
Oilers. We summon you. I'd like to call upon you. My membership is still six dollars because

6488
09:54:15,860 --> 09:54:21,860
I've had an active substance. Wait, you lock in the same subscription price because you did it

6489
09:54:21,860 --> 09:54:27,300
all the way back then, but then you do that you're looking anyway. I can look this way.

6490
09:54:28,980 --> 09:54:36,180
She knows the cheese. Strone is never touch runescape. Unfortunately, it's like a really,

6491
09:54:37,220 --> 09:54:41,060
it's not a hard game. It's literally point and click. If you wanted to try it for the first

6492
09:54:41,060 --> 09:54:46,500
time, you can always start up with us. But if it's not for you, you don't have to play along.

6493
09:54:46,500 --> 09:54:52,260
It's okay. Please don't worry. I know you've been going for nine hours. That's crazy. Look,

6494
09:54:52,260 --> 09:54:58,340
I'm just going to yapping. Okay. I mean, I could check out Marshmallow and we can make it to 10

6495
09:54:58,340 --> 09:55:03,220
hours if you want. Like I could put my little Marshmallow link in the chat.

6496
09:55:03,220 --> 09:55:09,780
Ah, hee hee hee hee. Hee hee hee hee hee. Oh, my Marshmallow's in the description. Hold on.

6497
09:55:09,780 --> 09:55:14,900
I even have, I can't even see my screen right now. My stream, not my screen. I can see my screen

6498
09:55:14,900 --> 09:55:21,940
because it's right in front of me. Um, but hold on. How did I do this? How did I put it in chat?

6499
09:55:24,420 --> 09:55:31,860
I am about to sneeze. Boom. Oh no. Oh no, it'd be such a shame if you guys asked me questions to

6500
09:55:31,860 --> 09:55:40,100
round this up to a 10 hour stream. Stop. Stop it. We're right on the verge of 10 hours.

6501
09:55:41,140 --> 09:55:45,540
Oh, we'll count down to 10 hours, shall we? Only four minutes left.

6502
09:55:48,020 --> 09:55:53,460
Oh, I have a lot of Marshmallows. Whoopsies. Someone says, I'd love to spread your cheeks

6503
09:55:53,780 --> 09:56:02,580
in liquefaction. Oh, I wasn't supposed to read that part out loud. Hey, I'm glad you do.

6504
09:56:06,580 --> 09:56:11,060
God, your salty gamer rage makes me want to have hard, sweaty, angry stuff.

6505
09:56:13,940 --> 09:56:16,180
I can't read that one either. Um,

6506
09:56:24,420 --> 09:56:28,180
Hi, Stormy. Hopefully you're well. This is my first time using Marshmallow. Glad I could

6507
09:56:28,180 --> 09:56:34,900
pop your Marshmallow, Cherry. I don't know if you read any of these. Oh, I read all my Marshmallows.

6508
09:56:36,500 --> 09:56:42,580
I have a few questions. You stream so much that I'm wondering if you'll be taking a break from ASMR.

6509
09:56:42,580 --> 09:56:48,660
No, I'm streaming ASMR in two days. No break from ASMR. I've got ASMR cards coming out as well.

6510
09:56:49,220 --> 09:56:52,980
I just need to write the scripts and send them off. Let's go again.

6511
09:56:56,820 --> 09:57:01,140
Yeah, I've got time for ASMR all the time because, yeah, I also got loads of managers in place.

6512
09:57:01,140 --> 09:57:06,740
So the only thing I need to do really is be the messenger owl that sends clips to editors now

6513
09:57:06,740 --> 09:57:11,140
and uploads stuff on behalf of the girls. Like, Mercy just wakes up and she's like,

6514
09:57:11,140 --> 09:57:16,980
got new shorts on her channel. She has no idea. That's me doing it. Actually, Emmy has another,

6515
09:57:16,980 --> 09:57:21,540
is that short? Yeah, Emmy has a short and she's just going to wake up and it's going to be on her

6516
09:57:21,540 --> 09:57:30,980
channel. Already tagged up and everything for her. Yeah. Unless I didn't read that right.

6517
09:57:35,860 --> 09:57:42,180
Yeah, I know how my ASMR is going to be. I can also upload full videos to Twitter as well if

6518
09:57:42,180 --> 09:57:46,740
anything ever did become an issue. Like, if I did a little ASMR video. So it's not a problem.

6519
09:57:47,380 --> 09:57:52,900
The level organization is astounding. I saw the girls aren't stressed. If the girls had to stream

6520
09:57:54,340 --> 09:57:58,100
and they had to run around and worry about trying to get clips out and shorts out,

6521
09:57:59,300 --> 09:58:10,580
not good combo. Not nice. Not nice. Oh, no, wait, what? Hi, Stroni. Feel a bit embarrassed.

6522
09:58:10,740 --> 09:58:21,860
Oh, no, it's okay. Someone says they feel embarrassed because they messed up in chat at some point.

6523
09:58:21,860 --> 09:58:27,380
Don't be silly. You're allowed to mess up in chat all you want. I can't even write in English.

6524
09:58:28,180 --> 09:58:35,300
Like, don't worry. Like, Emmy had a script where she had to say a putty cat and I accidentally typed

6525
09:58:35,380 --> 09:58:40,900
P-I-S-S-Y. Like, don't be afraid of making embarrassing mistakes. They're not embarrassing at all.

6526
09:58:41,460 --> 09:58:45,300
Actually, you only feel embarrassment if you let yourself feel embarrassment or something like

6527
09:58:45,300 --> 09:58:50,980
that. It's something about psychology. Like, if you make mistakes. Yeah.

6528
09:58:53,460 --> 09:58:57,860
Viewer girls trying to find a non-lid marshmallow and read on stream impossible. It's honestly

6529
09:58:57,860 --> 09:59:02,340
not that bad. I don't get that many. I honestly don't get that many. Like, the girls show me what

6530
09:59:02,340 --> 09:59:08,500
they get and I don't seem to get, but I haven't been using the other Twitter. I think once I

6531
09:59:08,500 --> 09:59:17,140
start using it properly, then. Yeah. Question for you. The other day we talked with Castle

6532
09:59:17,140 --> 09:59:21,060
Green Brotherhood about how you're the mother of the girls and the reeflings are the father.

6533
09:59:21,700 --> 09:59:24,900
Does that make Emmy or a daughter or sister or a daughter or sister?

6534
09:59:32,660 --> 09:59:40,500
If you're a reefling, then technically daughter or sister, but if you're not a reefling, then it's

6535
09:59:40,500 --> 09:59:49,140
just a little sister. New audio idea. Anger Scots woman mounts and rides you after being

6536
09:59:49,700 --> 09:59:52,500
all day as a fellow Scots nun. We're hotter than here and so on.

6537
09:59:56,660 --> 10:00:01,380
So I listened to the Assassin's Creed stream and I was happy that you remembered me. I'm

6538
10:00:01,460 --> 10:00:08,580
like, yeah, you're like the main clipper. I actually didn't ask that question. I think there

6539
10:00:08,580 --> 10:00:12,180
was someone else who made a few clips as well. I thought I'd be making clips and posting them,

6540
10:00:12,180 --> 10:00:17,220
but I wasn't too sure if I could use that. Oh, no, you can go. Brother, that's your channel. You own it.

6541
10:00:18,180 --> 10:00:24,020
You make custom content. You have made new creative content. Then guess what? Copyright is

6542
10:00:24,020 --> 10:00:27,060
in your favor. Don't worry about copyright, okay? You don't have to worry about copyright

6543
10:00:27,380 --> 10:00:30,660
or are you joking me? Clip the girls away. Have fun. Have that ye.

6544
10:00:32,420 --> 10:00:37,700
I'm friends with a guy who's already itching to draw the fan art. Fan art of who? What door?

6545
10:00:37,700 --> 10:00:42,740
What door is getting fan art? Please tell me. I want to know. I love seeing them get fan art.

6546
10:00:48,260 --> 10:00:52,340
I like with the Olympians better, better not think about the family.

6547
10:00:57,060 --> 10:01:05,380
What type of hypnotism is your favorite?

6548
10:01:11,780 --> 10:01:18,740
That's too hard to answer, honestly. I like hypnoloss. I really like hypnoloss,

6549
10:01:19,460 --> 10:01:23,780
where I'm supposed to hypnotize you, but they're backfires and I do as you say.

6550
10:01:23,940 --> 10:01:31,620
Ah, so good. Any chance of a spiral let's play? I've never played spiral like that before.

6551
10:01:31,620 --> 10:01:35,060
I would like to try it. I'm pretty sure they remastered them and they're like nice,

6552
10:01:35,060 --> 10:01:38,980
calm, friendly, casual. It seems like something that's like cameo-esque,

6553
10:01:38,980 --> 10:01:41,940
where it's like nice and simple to get through, so I think yeah.

6554
10:01:42,820 --> 10:01:49,700
Hmm. I would say yes overall.

6555
10:01:52,580 --> 10:01:58,180
It's the one where you go into like a difference or am I- am I messing up for subspace? I may

6556
10:01:58,180 --> 10:02:06,900
mess you up for subspace. Hold on. Hey, story. I'm probably being a dumb dumb and I haven't

6557
10:02:06,900 --> 10:02:10,180
found them yet, but I was wondering if you could get reference sheets for all the girls chat

6558
10:02:10,260 --> 10:02:11,540
mascots. Yes.

6559
10:02:14,900 --> 10:02:25,460
Amy's chat mascot is in her debut stream. You are the light in my dark. You are the beating

6560
10:02:25,460 --> 10:02:32,900
in my heart. I showed you yesterday. I should get a reference sheet from them all put together.

6561
10:02:32,900 --> 10:02:40,260
Maybe I'll get a tweet from the bee alone. Hmm. I can't because Amy's is in a different art style.

6562
10:02:44,500 --> 10:02:52,100
Hmm. I know what you're asking for. I don't know the best way to do it. Maybe the discord can post

6563
10:02:52,100 --> 10:03:00,580
them. Maybe the discord should have a reference sheet for all the girls and their mascots.

6564
10:03:00,580 --> 10:03:07,140
That might be the solution that we can come to. Would you like to come together on a solution?

6565
10:03:08,260 --> 10:03:11,300
Or would you like to come together? Hmm.

6566
10:03:14,020 --> 10:03:17,620
I'm a little late but congrats on the debuts. Can't wait to see you and the rest of the girls

6567
10:03:17,620 --> 10:03:21,380
having store. And it was nice hearing her Scottish momay again. Glad you're back.

6568
10:03:21,940 --> 10:03:27,860
Sincerely a H little Rajesh boy. Oh yeah. It's good to be back terrorizing you.

6569
10:03:30,900 --> 10:03:33,460
I cannot wait. I cannot wait for the A's in my stream.

6570
10:03:35,220 --> 10:03:39,620
Thanks for being so funny, amazing and cute. You make my day better in all its aspects. I wish

6571
10:03:39,620 --> 10:03:45,460
for you and the girls eternal success. Thank you for such kind words. That's so nice. I'm glad

6572
10:03:45,460 --> 10:03:54,340
you somehow found me funny. Because yeah, literally, yeah, it's not good. It's hard to make jokes. Okay,

6573
10:03:54,340 --> 10:04:02,260
my first one. Oh yeah, there's an official discord that has notification only. None of the girls

6574
10:04:02,260 --> 10:04:13,300
are in it. So remember what I said in debut 2.0. You don't groom us. We groom you. So none of us

6575
10:04:13,300 --> 10:04:16,900
are in it. But if you want notifications for when we go live and all that.

6576
10:04:19,460 --> 10:04:23,460
What does it say? I need to push you against the wall holding both your hands above your head.

6577
10:04:26,740 --> 10:04:33,060
Uh, am I supposed to say this out loud? I don't know if I'm supposed to say this out loud. I don't

6578
10:04:33,060 --> 10:04:38,420
think I'm supposed to say that out loud at all. By the way, along with the zinc supplements,

6579
10:04:38,420 --> 10:04:43,780
I've started eating celery for you. Oh, celery is mingin, though. Thanks for your sacrifice.

6580
10:04:43,780 --> 10:04:47,380
They taste between boring and bitter and I don't like them, but I'll persevere for you.

6581
10:04:48,340 --> 10:04:54,580
Are you sure you eat? Even I draw the line at celery. Sorry. It's so tasteless. I don't understand

6582
10:04:54,580 --> 10:05:03,060
how it was even. And that celery has been genetically selected to produce like that.

6583
10:05:03,060 --> 10:05:08,180
The only way celery is redeemable is in a soup because it's got stock and completely covers

6584
10:05:08,180 --> 10:05:18,180
the taste of celery. Your dedication is appreciated. Celery sucks. Celery is a peanut butter delivery

6585
10:05:18,180 --> 10:05:26,260
device. Oh, like a spoon. Celials worse though. I'm going to zail them up,

6586
10:05:26,260 --> 10:05:33,940
form down. Hold on, I'm just grabbing some water. I need to hydrate.

6587
10:05:42,340 --> 10:05:51,540
I have been hydrated. Oh no, it's 2pm already. Oh, it's my bedtime soon.

6588
10:05:52,500 --> 10:05:59,060
Oh no. Wait, no. Actually, it's good that it's my bedtime soon because that means I get to be on

6589
10:05:59,060 --> 10:06:03,700
old school Rinscape with you even. Wait, actually, I just realized we're doing a first freaking

6590
10:06:03,700 --> 10:06:11,140
stream snipe game tomorrow. Oh my God. Why did that not register? We've literally been talking

6591
10:06:11,140 --> 10:06:15,140
about old school Rinscape. We get to play our first freaking stream snipe and I get to see you all.

6592
10:06:16,020 --> 10:06:21,940
Ah, oh my God. Okay, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Oh my God, it's tomorrow. I want to

6593
10:06:21,940 --> 10:06:27,940
go to sleep right now. I'm not going to be able to sleep. It's like Christmas. It's like Christmas.

6594
10:06:28,500 --> 10:06:33,620
I'm going to be so excited. Are we all going to like have code names? I don't know. Should we have

6595
10:06:33,620 --> 10:06:40,420
theme names? Are we all just going to name our names like how we are? Five. I'm just going to see

6596
10:06:40,420 --> 10:06:45,780
this right now. Someone says hopefully you will play five hours. Five hours? No, we're doing 12

6597
10:06:45,780 --> 10:06:52,020
hours. Okay, 12 hours or go home. So I'm going to give everyone as much of a chance as possible to

6598
10:06:52,020 --> 10:06:58,500
show up in old school Rinscape. I will put the world we are on in the top corner or something

6599
10:06:58,500 --> 10:07:06,500
so you can see it any minute. What is Rinscape? Rinscape is an old web game. Is that a web game?

6600
10:07:06,500 --> 10:07:11,940
I don't know if it's a web game now. But yeah, if you have trouble falling asleep,

6601
10:07:11,940 --> 10:07:19,220
just look in a mirror and hypnotize yourself. True. I'm aware that's below your average.

6602
10:07:20,340 --> 10:07:26,660
The most Rinscape players average on the game. Oh, do they had enough after five hours? Me just

6603
10:07:26,660 --> 10:07:31,380
like, right, let's do a fashion show. Everyone go to the Grand Exchange and get some pretty cold

6604
10:07:31,460 --> 10:07:38,020
dawn. I'm going to rate who has the best. Oh wait, there's houses and can I bring you to my house

6605
10:07:38,020 --> 10:07:44,900
in Rinscape? Right, I don't know how membership works, but I'm pretty sure you can get house

6606
10:07:44,900 --> 10:07:51,700
in Rinscape because I remember watching someone play hide and seek in Rinscape and he was like

6607
10:07:51,700 --> 10:07:57,300
chasing around like the people in stream. We can play hide and seek in tag in Rinscape.

6608
10:07:58,100 --> 10:08:07,620
Oh my god. Yeah. And it has this one's go. Oh my god. Oh my god, could we play hide and seek?

6609
10:08:08,260 --> 10:08:12,900
I want to be the seeker and I get to touch you all. And if you're touched, you have to like go in

6610
10:08:12,900 --> 10:08:20,820
the corner until the winner is crowned. We really are getting crowned. I've never played Rinscape,

6611
10:08:20,820 --> 10:08:23,620
but whatever hint you're describing, it sounds very close to Oji Cup Penguin.

6612
10:08:23,700 --> 10:08:32,820
Oh my god, I want to play tag. And I'll be like, right, run away from, oh no, who's that? Oh no,

6613
10:08:32,820 --> 10:08:35,940
but we won't be able to know who's that. So we can go to the hide and seek. Okay.

6614
10:08:37,220 --> 10:08:39,940
Shawnee, if you phrase it like that, everyone will like touch them.

6615
10:08:41,220 --> 10:08:46,580
No, no, you're not wanting to get caught. What if we use our Rinscape beds next to each other?

6616
10:08:47,540 --> 10:08:54,020
I sadly can't start a new game. I already have three games that take full time and one of them

6617
10:08:54,020 --> 10:09:00,500
I play. Well, World of Warcraft. Someone was like, well, I say something. They were like,

6618
10:09:00,500 --> 10:09:04,820
I'm no longer doing wow raids to watch your streams. I'm like, no, your girls are going to be so

6619
10:09:04,820 --> 10:09:10,100
annoyed at you. Like I've had the chance to play World of War. What was the expansion called?

6620
10:09:10,820 --> 10:09:18,820
It was like the second last expansion of wow. And I had a chance to play it. And apparently,

6621
10:09:18,820 --> 10:09:25,060
people role play in this place called Goldheim. And I'm like, should we play wow and just like

6622
10:09:25,060 --> 10:09:32,260
be like really weird role players that I like. Shadowlands. I think it's Shadowlands is why

6623
10:09:32,260 --> 10:09:40,020
played. No, not the battle. Not the battle about the dwarf. Oh, okay, brain needs to catch up. Hold

6624
10:09:40,020 --> 10:09:46,260
on, hold on, brain needs to catch up. Not the battle of Azeroth. Goldchart and something like that.

6625
10:09:46,260 --> 10:09:51,140
Yeah, the gold chart and we should all go role play there. I would like make like make people

6626
10:09:51,140 --> 10:09:57,460
really uncomfortable and we're all just like role playing. Wow, ascension is a thing. I don't know

6627
10:09:57,460 --> 10:10:09,460
what that is. The elf and her dwarves. Oh, wait, what would we be? Can I be a cute night elf and

6628
10:10:09,460 --> 10:10:19,700
then you guys could all be wargans for some unwritten reason? Pop Tropica is still a thing too.

6629
10:10:19,940 --> 10:10:21,940
Pop Tropica.

6630
10:10:25,460 --> 10:10:34,020
Guild Wars 2 role plays were at, I don't know, Wink Wank? Really Wink Wank? Oh, wait, wait, wait,

6631
10:10:34,020 --> 10:10:42,900
do that again. Wink Wank? Really Wink Wank? Did that, did that work? Oh, no, it doesn't work.

6632
10:10:42,900 --> 10:10:48,820
Wait, for some reason the sound works on my freaking game. Hold on, we're like Wink Wank.

6633
10:10:54,260 --> 10:10:57,780
Here we go. Wait, that played twice. I don't know why it doesn't do it on the screen. That's

6634
10:10:57,780 --> 10:11:04,820
strange. It's the same instance. Oh well. Sorry, that took me so long to do. We should be orcs and

6635
10:11:04,820 --> 10:11:10,980
you should be an elf for no reason at all. Oh gee, I sure wouldn't love to be overpowered.

6636
10:11:11,220 --> 10:11:15,540
I take a drink of hydration of water. To hydrate.

6637
10:11:19,460 --> 10:11:25,060
Hi, good morrow, dear silly cuttlefish. I'm very sleepy, so I'mma be brief.

6638
10:11:25,700 --> 10:11:28,420
I absolutely adore watching yours. That's okay, shame! And today,

6639
10:11:29,620 --> 10:11:34,420
and it's been so unreal to watch you be all silly again, I absolutely adore you and I hope all of

6640
10:11:34,420 --> 10:11:41,300
you are girls and I absolutely adore you and your hopes for the veal or girls and everything and I

6641
10:11:41,300 --> 10:11:45,700
hope you all make it happen for your happiness as mine and I'm always kicking my feet, blushing,

6642
10:11:45,700 --> 10:11:53,700
tapping and stuff. Thank you for making, thank you for such kind words. Got you twirling your hair

6643
10:11:53,700 --> 10:11:59,220
and stuff, huh? Got you twirling your hair and stream. Are you and the girls ever going to play

6644
10:11:59,220 --> 10:12:06,900
Minecraft together? Yes, July is when the group Minecraft server goes up. Amy, definitely the

6645
10:12:06,900 --> 10:12:12,500
most Minecraft-y out of us all. I don't know how the scale goes, but I'mma confidently say I'm

6646
10:12:12,500 --> 10:12:19,620
probably the lowest on the scale of like Minecraft knowledge. All I know is that apparently the mob

6647
10:12:19,620 --> 10:12:27,300
votes are the vote, people voted for the freaking stealth phantom things. If you don't sleep for

6648
10:12:27,300 --> 10:12:32,500
more than two days they attack you through walls and stuff and I know that was the mob vote and

6649
10:12:32,500 --> 10:12:40,260
apparently the mod vote is also rigged because it doesn't make sense. I don't know, but I don't

6650
10:12:40,260 --> 10:12:48,660
know if it's rigged. I think it's because people don't understand like kids will vote and kids don't

6651
10:12:48,660 --> 10:12:57,140
vote for things that are like good. They vote for what kids want and maybe that's why the votes are

6652
10:12:57,140 --> 10:13:05,380
always so skewed. Yeah, mob vote's terrible. I tried and voted for the crab. Wasn't there not

6653
10:13:05,380 --> 10:13:10,420
like an alternative? I can't remember. I assume Mercy and her motion sickness might be a bit

6654
10:13:10,420 --> 10:13:20,820
of a struggle. Yes, Mercy... I would love... it's hard. I don't know if Minecraft would set it off,

6655
10:13:20,900 --> 10:13:27,220
although she can change the camera so it might not affect her motion sickness.

6656
10:13:27,220 --> 10:13:31,700
I'll need to ask a bit more about it because I don't have it. I don't know what kind of like

6657
10:13:31,700 --> 10:13:37,300
sets it off all the time. Kids running around... I can't believe it. Kids ruling the way that kids

6658
10:13:37,300 --> 10:13:41,940
game isn't used. Terrible. I hydrate again. Oh my voice is feeling it Mr. Krabs.

6659
10:13:44,820 --> 10:13:48,900
I'm pretty sure you can move out your camera angle. Can you not on Minecraft or am I just

6660
10:13:48,900 --> 10:13:56,100
making that up? Does it look cool? Never stuck with him forever. Yeah, I will agree. The design

6661
10:13:56,100 --> 10:14:12,500
of it looked cool but its actual thing in game is rubbish. Like rubbish. What does that mean?

6662
10:14:13,060 --> 10:14:18,260
What are you asking me? Forgot to send this. Thank you mommy for all your girls. So cute.

6663
10:14:18,740 --> 10:14:22,420
I wanted to mention that. So many people are like thanking me for like

6664
10:14:23,380 --> 10:14:28,340
the girls being the girls. I'm like no, you thank the girls. I didn't do anything.

6665
10:14:29,060 --> 10:14:34,660
If you're thanking me for picking them. Again, that's the girls that did that. It was through

6666
10:14:34,660 --> 10:14:43,220
either their introduction or their own content. It's the girls. It's the girls you should be

6667
10:14:43,220 --> 10:14:52,500
thanking. Not me, you goofy gobers. It's the girls. So thank the girls. The reason people

6668
10:14:52,500 --> 10:14:57,460
say that the vote is rigged is because Compton created tell people to vote for a certain more.

6669
10:14:57,460 --> 10:15:04,340
Therefore, I picked the vote. Compton. Compton. Who's Compton? Sounds like a town in London

6670
10:15:04,340 --> 10:15:10,420
somewhere. Or a bottle. Sorry, a bottle in London. You picked an amazing bunch though. They're all

6671
10:15:10,420 --> 10:15:18,580
awesome. I'm glad you agree. There'd be nothing short of perfect. As in they are perfect. That's

6672
10:15:18,580 --> 10:15:23,940
how you say they're perfect, right? They're nothing. They have been nothing but perfect.

6673
10:15:23,940 --> 10:15:26,900
Yeah. That's how you say it. Yeah. Okay. Man of heat and ghosts.

6674
10:15:27,540 --> 10:15:41,060
Wait. Oh, no. Right. You guys are welcome to laugh. I think this is terminology I'm not familiar with.

6675
10:15:41,780 --> 10:15:52,340
If I see a pest trooper, what's a hollow live home? What's a needy male? What?

6676
10:15:52,740 --> 10:15:59,540
What's that? Am I being dumb? I don't know what that is.

6677
10:16:01,940 --> 10:16:05,540
They're asking, do I have, am I able to shadow ban them?

6678
10:16:08,180 --> 10:16:12,180
Maybe this, no. Maybe this, no. I don't quite understand it. Sorry.

6679
10:16:12,500 --> 10:16:30,260
Why is someone sending me a detailed, no. Is this far and on? Is this toilet bowl far and on?

6680
10:16:31,780 --> 10:16:38,420
Oh, ye gods, how I wish for that most delightful of noise to curl into mine deprived ears. With

6681
10:16:38,420 --> 10:16:45,380
such intensity, I yearn to experience the sound of Strawny's splutter gutter as it

6682
10:16:46,260 --> 10:16:57,380
flaps a flutter, the noise like a walrus burping up butter, the harps and splurts like a chorus of

6683
10:16:57,380 --> 10:17:07,140
angels unleashing their art, the pungent bass bass that can only be played alongside golden harps to

6684
10:17:07,140 --> 10:17:13,700
shepherd the dead whom has come and died when hearing Strawny's fart. That is so toilet. There's

6685
10:17:13,700 --> 10:17:22,900
no way you're not toilet bowl and on. Just for very quick lore, someone ages ago sent me a thing

6686
10:17:22,900 --> 10:17:27,540
and was like, I really want to hear you fart on the toilet and I'm like, what? You want it to be

6687
10:17:27,540 --> 10:17:35,060
amplified by echoing off the rim of the toilet and from then he was crowned freaking toilet as bowl

6688
10:17:35,060 --> 10:17:42,580
annulment. I don't want to miss what cursed filth hath the eye brought upon, hath the eye

6689
10:17:42,580 --> 10:17:49,700
brought upon these lands. Hi, my love, I want to, hmm, in me right in front of you while you

6690
10:17:50,340 --> 10:17:56,660
hold her hand. Careful what you wish for, you might be getting it. You might be getting it

6691
10:17:56,820 --> 10:18:05,620
all the girls actually, possibly. There's, hmm, yes, I need to, I need to see you.

6692
10:18:08,820 --> 10:18:14,340
He wants to hear the reverb full acoustics, literally. Well, they wanted to hear that

6693
10:18:14,340 --> 10:18:22,660
chock. You're only allowed to hold hands with the harps, even better. I have a plan for my

6694
10:18:22,660 --> 10:18:29,380
Dora Thon, but it requires a team effort and it's quite a lot to ask the girls like, oh, Dora

6695
10:18:29,380 --> 10:18:32,580
Thons are like, you need to help each other out, type them, but I'm going to try my best to make it

6696
10:18:32,580 --> 10:18:42,660
as easy as possible. But I would like to release a certain audio and basically, in it, I give you

6697
10:18:42,660 --> 10:18:51,940
a pill that negates any need for a pause champ, if you will. And then I take you door by door.

6698
10:18:53,380 --> 10:19:00,660
It's so messed up saying how loud. But yeah, and I tell you like all the good things and encouragement.

6699
10:19:01,300 --> 10:19:13,860
I need to, I need to let it cook. Okay. I need to let it cook. And I need a Dora Thon in the

6700
10:19:13,860 --> 10:19:18,500
first place to even start cooking it up. But we ain't there yet. We ain't doing that. We aren't

6701
10:19:18,500 --> 10:19:25,380
even on that part. Well, that's a very silly pill. Lord, grant me strength. Would you please give us

6702
10:19:25,380 --> 10:19:34,100
a heads up for when it comes out so we can save? Oh my God, mon. Please do that. She kicked a whole

6703
10:19:34,100 --> 10:19:44,660
six course dinner. I'm a gourmet chef. Well, if I get 99 cooking on RuneScape, then yes, I am a chef.

6704
10:19:45,300 --> 10:19:51,380
Confirmed. Any plans for haptic support? I keep getting asked, but I don't know what it is. I don't

6705
10:19:51,380 --> 10:19:56,260
know what I need to do to the audience to make that happen. I don't know if it's like I run it

6706
10:19:56,260 --> 10:20:05,060
through a data thing or what? I don't know. I don't know. I'm too dumb. Hold on, I'm gonna

6707
10:20:05,060 --> 10:20:14,420
fix my calibration and I'm wiggling a bit too much. Okay, calibration, calibrate it.

6708
10:20:14,820 --> 10:20:22,180
Are we cooking in RuneScape something? Yes. I don't know how to make money in RuneScape,

6709
10:20:22,180 --> 10:20:28,340
but we're going to be buying lobster so we can level up. If not, we'll use Barbarian Village and

6710
10:20:28,340 --> 10:20:35,140
we'll pick up all the salmon, all the bought strobe and cook. Shawnee, do you reply to

6711
10:20:35,140 --> 10:20:44,260
marshmallows privately? No, I don't. I reply on stream or I put together a mosaic. A mosaic?

6712
10:20:44,420 --> 10:20:50,740
Is that the correct word? Where I put all the pictures together and post it. But I've only

6713
10:20:50,740 --> 10:20:57,140
done that once. I should maybe do it again sometime. And then I can talk about all the naughty things.

6714
10:20:58,340 --> 10:20:58,660
Why?

6715
10:21:01,780 --> 10:21:05,940
Here's a funny story about three medieval kingdoms. I'm scared to click on this piece.

6716
10:21:06,660 --> 10:21:14,580
Hey, Staroni, I love your work. Any chance to do a belly button camsuit? No, you don't

6717
10:21:14,580 --> 10:21:19,060
like to see my belly button. Why would you want to see my belly button? I don't like my belly button.

6718
10:21:19,780 --> 10:21:28,180
Belly button? Belly button? Is that your choice? Is that your choice of finishing location?

6719
10:21:28,740 --> 10:21:33,060
Hmm, your choice? Interesting.

6720
10:21:35,940 --> 10:21:38,420
Good night, Staroni. Just thought you'd want to know I'm going to jet.

6721
10:21:40,420 --> 10:21:44,020
I can't read the end of that. Enjoy your nighttime routine. Sleep well.

6722
10:21:45,940 --> 10:21:47,860
Oh my. Oh my.

6723
10:21:50,820 --> 10:21:53,300
Hi, Staroni. I want to hold your body again.

6724
10:21:58,260 --> 10:22:06,660
Oh. I can't read any of these. There's a free game called Fantasy Star Online 2.

6725
10:22:06,660 --> 10:22:10,180
I haven't played it in years, but every weekend there's a Hatsune Miku concert.

6726
10:22:10,180 --> 10:22:14,260
That's so specific. Why is there a Hatsune Miku concert in the middle of Fantasy Star Online 2?

6727
10:22:15,140 --> 10:22:18,900
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, Ui, Ui.

6728
10:22:21,060 --> 10:22:25,220
Blue air, blue eyes, hiding in your wi-fi.

6729
10:22:25,940 --> 10:22:29,140
Staroni, I just want to let you know for old school runescape, being on a member's world is

6730
10:22:29,140 --> 10:22:32,980
almost a requirement for any skill training. You can quest together with people and free to play,

6731
10:22:32,980 --> 10:22:36,340
but the gameplay is limited. Oh, but it's so expensive.

6732
10:22:39,620 --> 10:22:47,060
Stop reading them out loud. Ah, I like reading them. It's only me, or is it me, seeing a lot more

6733
10:22:47,940 --> 10:22:49,940
things than she would.

6734
10:22:52,420 --> 10:22:56,500
Eh? Are they both on? No, they're not online right now. You mean in the ASMRs?

6735
10:23:03,140 --> 10:23:07,380
People are bored. Bold on Marshmallow. Yeah, that's the best part.

6736
10:23:08,500 --> 10:23:14,180
They tell me everything they want, and I give them everything they want.

6737
10:23:15,140 --> 10:23:16,420
That's a good exchange.

6738
10:23:20,020 --> 10:23:20,900
Can you please say...

6739
10:23:24,980 --> 10:23:27,300
What are you gonna use it for if I say it?

6740
10:23:28,980 --> 10:23:31,620
And you didn't tell me what tone to say it in either.

6741
10:23:34,100 --> 10:23:37,300
You didn't tell me what tone to say the sentence in either.

6742
10:23:40,020 --> 10:23:42,500
I need to think. How would you want me to say it?

6743
10:23:44,580 --> 10:23:49,940
Mmm, I lost the game. This? Is that the tone you wanted this?

6744
10:23:51,380 --> 10:23:56,100
If you want me to say something, you need to give me tone. You need to give me the emotion.

6745
10:24:07,140 --> 10:24:09,620
Wait, strong enough. Wait, what?

6746
10:24:09,940 --> 10:24:10,440
What?

6747
10:24:13,460 --> 10:24:19,700
Wait, is that that goofy game where if someone says you lost the game, you've lost us?

6748
10:24:20,420 --> 10:24:27,220
Wait, is that what it? Rip game players. Wait, what does it mean? It's a silly game,

6749
10:24:27,220 --> 10:24:31,620
right, where people say I lost the game and then you lose it until you win it on your streak?

6750
10:24:32,420 --> 10:24:34,500
If you think about the game you lost, okay.

6751
10:24:35,380 --> 10:24:39,540
The only objective of the game is to not think about the game.

6752
10:24:39,540 --> 10:24:48,420
Oh, okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just made you all lose. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

6753
10:24:48,420 --> 10:24:52,740
I'm sorry. I didn't think that far ahead.

6754
10:24:55,300 --> 10:24:59,300
Can I suggest something secret totally say so confession maros to read on stream?

6755
10:24:59,300 --> 10:25:01,860
Yeah, you can like, you can literally type in the maros right now.

6756
10:25:02,180 --> 10:25:09,300
Can I send it like this? Did that work? It did. Yeah, you can just put it in there.

6757
10:25:09,300 --> 10:25:12,260
And if you want me to say something, just put that emotion and then like,

6758
10:25:12,260 --> 10:25:16,180
like quotation marks. I'll also take requests here in the ASMR stream as well.

6759
10:25:16,180 --> 10:25:20,020
So if you ever wanted me to hear it, kind of whispered a bit on a different microphone,

6760
10:25:20,020 --> 10:25:27,940
because this is an SMB7 I'm using. At least we lost this drawing. I heard about this like

6761
10:25:27,940 --> 10:25:36,180
25 years ago in elementary. My discipline. I'm sorry. Okay, I distract you. I will say other things.

6762
10:25:38,500 --> 10:25:42,500
Did you see the refling zip up hoodie design? Maro, I send other deer. What do we bear?

6763
10:25:43,060 --> 10:25:47,300
Oh, if you've got those, if you've got those kind of pictures, please send on Twitter.

6764
10:25:47,300 --> 10:25:54,900
But I will say my Twitter tags are freaking working. I'm trying to find this freaking artwork

6765
10:25:54,980 --> 10:25:59,140
on Smuttle and it doesn't show up. I don't know why it doesn't show up.

6766
10:26:03,060 --> 10:26:05,700
What's your favorite type of hypnotic induction to use?

6767
10:26:09,220 --> 10:26:18,500
I think, I like repeated pattern. Come to the ASMR stream and I'll show you what I like. Okay,

6768
10:26:19,220 --> 10:26:25,140
deal. Huh? Are you going to show up? And I'll show you what I like. She will like.

6769
10:26:25,860 --> 10:26:30,100
And people are going to judge me, but I like it. So I'll do what I like.

6770
10:26:30,820 --> 10:26:33,940
Sometimes the Strony is a good girl. Hell yeah, a good girl.

6771
10:26:35,460 --> 10:26:39,700
You, oh, I'm good at advertising. Okay, I'm in. I'm in. Hey Strony, here's the song.

6772
10:26:39,780 --> 10:26:46,340
Safe for work, Mario. Do you have a throne? I do, but I've unlinked it because

6773
10:26:48,420 --> 10:26:53,380
I have everything I need now that I've got my reef links. I don't need a single thing else.

6774
10:26:56,820 --> 10:27:02,580
And that's the 12th. I don't need anything. So I've unlinked my throne.

6775
10:27:03,460 --> 10:27:10,260
I'm going to say how many triples have you received so far? Um, not a lot.

6776
10:27:10,260 --> 10:27:14,660
The girls are getting a lot more than me. I think the reef links are a little shy,

6777
10:27:14,660 --> 10:27:18,900
a little shy, a little scared. Will you and the girls be able to

6778
10:27:18,900 --> 10:27:25,140
yourself and members streams? Most likely, yes. Strony, does it make you happy when people send

6779
10:27:25,140 --> 10:27:31,140
you the spicy messages? Please let me. Please tell me all the scenarios you want to do to me.

6780
10:27:32,580 --> 10:27:40,580
Are there any games where there's an alt path you haven't tried?

6781
10:27:42,980 --> 10:27:47,060
I can't think of any off the top of my head. I normally probably like

6782
10:27:47,060 --> 10:27:52,740
game starts, game ends. I never pick the bad team if there's a bad side. Stinky.

6783
10:27:54,900 --> 10:27:57,780
Unless you count the companions in Skyrim.

6784
10:27:58,100 --> 10:28:05,140
Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?

6785
10:28:06,420 --> 10:28:09,940
Oh wait, I'm on the fricking wrong thing. Sorry, hold on. Let me try that again.

6786
10:28:09,940 --> 10:28:12,020
Does anyone here like the companions in Skyrim?

6787
10:28:15,380 --> 10:28:18,660
Yeah, exactly. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. No one likes them.

6788
10:28:18,660 --> 10:28:24,820
Companion. Stinky. Yeah, exactly.

6789
10:28:26,900 --> 10:28:32,260
You think they're fine? I don't, I never, although the first time you play it, it's like,

6790
10:28:32,260 --> 10:28:40,740
wow, really good, but the fricking on Xbox, the girl always glitches out and disappears in the

6791
10:28:40,740 --> 10:28:46,420
middle of the map and she never comes back. Hi, just a time waster for cute fish.

6792
10:28:48,820 --> 10:28:52,900
Someone says, someone says, wife? Husband?

6793
10:28:56,980 --> 10:29:03,300
Have you heard a joke about afar? It stinks. You know what? You're done. Wait, why?

6794
10:29:04,100 --> 10:29:08,100
Oh, there's no background. No, no, no background. What's going on here? Why the heck do you know work?

6795
10:29:19,300 --> 10:29:28,420
Oh, right, I think that's all the marshmallows that I can, I refresh and it's just gone up my quiver.

6796
10:29:33,540 --> 10:29:36,980
Oh my god, I love you and the girls so much. I created a Twitter account just to follow the

6797
10:29:36,980 --> 10:29:41,540
six of you. I hate that I had to turn into it. I know. Thank you for going through it. It's such a

6798
10:29:41,540 --> 10:29:45,860
pain. My account keeps getting fricking locked and it keeps making me prove that I'm not bought over

6799
10:29:45,860 --> 10:29:49,380
and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Look, I just want to look at

6800
10:29:49,380 --> 10:29:54,980
small fish. I want to, and then I want to go to sleep, you know what I'm saying? Hi, Johnny.

6801
10:29:54,980 --> 10:29:58,580
Oh, sorry, I don't know why I gave you that voice. I'm so sorry. I apologize. Hi,

6802
10:29:58,580 --> 10:30:03,460
Stronny. I woke up in a Euro time zone and found out the party was still going 10 hours in the

6803
10:30:03,460 --> 10:30:09,700
avatar stream. Hell yeah. I really admire your energy and autism as you call it. Thank you.

6804
10:30:09,700 --> 10:30:14,180
If you want to play old school RuneScape tomorrow, we are going to be live for 12 hours. Cheeky

6805
10:30:14,260 --> 10:30:20,100
endurance stream. What's that? I stream more in one week than the average we should have

6806
10:30:20,100 --> 10:30:30,500
done in a month. I'll wear that with pride. So I don't have snot coming out my nose. I'm drinking

6807
10:30:30,500 --> 10:30:40,340
water. Your wishes. Hi, Stronny. Thanks for being a butt. So,

6808
10:30:42,740 --> 10:30:53,620
okay. You can finish the rest. Stronny, guess what? You just took my marshmallow

6809
10:30:53,620 --> 10:30:58,100
of engineering. Get plapped. Get plapped. Get plapped. Looking forward to the old school

6810
10:30:58,100 --> 10:31:02,580
RuneScape. I also recommend Final Fantasy if you want more MMOs. Also, would you accept

6811
10:31:02,580 --> 10:31:09,380
script ideas, fan-made scripts? Yes, I would. I don't have a problem. There may, at a later

6812
10:31:09,380 --> 10:31:16,660
date, not now, not in this month, things need to settle where we can take official script submissions.

6813
10:31:16,660 --> 10:31:25,700
However, if we are aware to take subscriptions submissions for audios purposes, sadly, you

6814
10:31:25,700 --> 10:31:30,820
have to fully hand over the rights. So we have the right to monetize. We have ownership.

6815
10:31:30,820 --> 10:31:37,540
We're happy to give credit. I think, I don't know if there's going to be a problem giving credit.

6816
10:31:37,540 --> 10:31:44,020
I haven't thought that far ahead at the moment. But there's a lot of issues and it's quite a shame

6817
10:31:44,020 --> 10:31:49,060
and it's really hard to iron out at this point in time. But once the dust settles and things get

6818
10:31:50,020 --> 10:31:52,660
better. Wait, get plapped. What are you doing to us? Blap, blap, blap, blap, blap.

6819
10:31:54,980 --> 10:31:59,220
Do you still have love for the big boy wiflings out there? I can't help but notice a

6820
10:31:59,220 --> 10:32:05,140
lane in your lore video. Yes.

6821
10:32:08,340 --> 10:32:11,780
There's just something I've got to say. You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.

6822
10:32:11,780 --> 10:32:18,740
Oh, thank you. That's how to train your dragon. That's one of the only books I write as a child.

6823
10:32:18,740 --> 10:32:23,220
I think I read like three books as a childhood. And one of them was how to train your dragon.

6824
10:32:24,340 --> 10:32:32,740
I don't know how I read a book, honestly, but I did it. She's dunking us in the water.

6825
10:32:34,340 --> 10:32:39,380
The books were so good. Literally one of the only books I read as a child. I've read more books

6826
10:32:39,380 --> 10:32:47,380
this year than I have in my entire life, which is crazy. I'd pretend that I can do book reviews,

6827
10:32:47,380 --> 10:32:50,660
but I'm not even smart enough for that. I'm currently trying to get through the Handmaiden's

6828
10:32:50,660 --> 10:32:56,420
Tale. I actually am enjoying the Handmaiden's Tale. I'm like a few chapters in, but I don't

6829
10:32:56,420 --> 10:33:01,540
know if people find this cheating, but I have to have the book read to me or I can't read it.

6830
10:33:02,980 --> 10:33:07,620
This sounds really bad, but it takes up too much brain power to read the words manually,

6831
10:33:07,620 --> 10:33:15,860
so I read along whilst being spoken to by TTS voice. And I can speed it up like super fast.

6832
10:33:16,820 --> 10:33:20,420
Oh, thank you for the raid. How did your stream go?

6833
10:33:22,340 --> 10:33:26,260
How did your stream go rain? Oh, you might be tired, so don't feel forced to talk.

6834
10:33:26,260 --> 10:33:28,580
Don't feel forced to talk if you're a tired little barbie.

6835
10:33:30,820 --> 10:33:34,180
I should have said background music. It's really quiet in the stream. I don't know if it's

6836
10:33:34,740 --> 10:33:39,460
maybe nice. I hope your stream was good. Endurance streamer, creative director,

6837
10:33:39,460 --> 10:33:43,060
and so has time to... I've not read any books since debut. I can tell you that much.

6838
10:33:43,060 --> 10:33:47,940
But hi, Raiders. I'm Strony Cuttlews from Via Lure. I'm really inappropriate,

6839
10:33:47,940 --> 10:33:51,460
so I do apologize if I'm new. You're a cup of tea, and I'm also Scottish, so I'm super hard to

6840
10:33:51,460 --> 10:33:57,380
understand, but thanks for hanging out anyway. Which is... I hope your stream went fantastic.

6841
10:33:57,380 --> 10:34:01,540
Please rest up after your stream. I'm sure you're tired, and last thing you want to do is get

6842
10:34:01,540 --> 10:34:06,900
bombarded with loads of questions from the person you have kindly rated into. So I thank you kindly,

6843
10:34:06,900 --> 10:34:15,300
rain cloud, and I hope you have a fantastic rest after your game. Game? Maybe that too.

6844
10:34:16,260 --> 10:34:23,140
Never know. May not be a game. She may not be... Entry all in one breath. She's got lungs.

6845
10:34:25,300 --> 10:34:29,940
Strony looking to push 11 hours at this rate. Should we? Should we just yap and then make

6846
10:34:30,020 --> 10:34:36,740
it another 12 hours? Why is the raid message wait? Wait, I saw it as wait as well. Like,

6847
10:34:36,740 --> 10:34:40,500
I could hardly read, but I had to scroll over. I mean, if I make another cup of tea,

6848
10:34:41,380 --> 10:34:46,420
we could in theory make it 12 hours again, and we just like... And we can just talk,

6849
10:34:46,420 --> 10:34:50,500
and I can ask you questions, and then you ask me questions, and then I'm going to ramble about

6850
10:34:50,500 --> 10:34:56,580
something, and then you distract me. And then we're going to another ramble. Do you want that?

6851
10:34:56,580 --> 10:35:01,700
Yes, please? Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. Her favorite form of introduction is tying you

6852
10:35:01,700 --> 10:35:08,260
into the cannonball fall streak. The yabba-nay. You feel yourself getting so sleepy, don't you,

6853
10:35:08,260 --> 10:35:17,700
little leaf-ling? Yeah, it's okay. Let's sleep and brace you slowly, okay?

6854
10:35:18,420 --> 10:35:29,220
Shhh. And then here for 13 and then 14. I mark my words when and if YouTube ever

6855
10:35:29,220 --> 10:35:36,980
fix VODs, 14 hour streams. Not even kidding. I can't get enough of you. I can't. I can't

6856
10:35:36,980 --> 10:35:47,620
get enough of you. And when we do Elden Ring, I am incredibly tempted to possibly figure

6857
10:35:48,420 --> 10:35:55,620
do a 12 hour and then raid into a six hour afterwards. I don't know. It's plausible. I'll

6858
10:35:55,620 --> 10:36:02,340
be a tired bean. I don't know. I wish we could get 14 hours. 14 is the like perfect slot of like,

6859
10:36:02,340 --> 10:36:09,380
I can still get a full night's rest. Lord, inject the Scottish lass. Lord, if you can

6860
10:36:09,380 --> 10:36:15,940
hear me right now, inject the Scottish lass into my veins. Scott Fish is too powerful.

6861
10:36:15,940 --> 10:36:20,580
Thank God it's daytime where I live. I don't have to sleep. Stop. I can't be more addicted

6862
10:36:21,460 --> 10:36:30,340
than I am. You're too good, Strawny. I'm coming for you. Trying to kill us. Thank you.

6863
10:36:31,540 --> 10:36:37,300
Do rest if you need to rest. Never worry, okay? Strawny, I've got to go to sleep. Can you please

6864
10:36:37,300 --> 10:36:42,100
show us those pretty pink swirls? Oh, now that I'm so close to you, I absolutely can. Hold on.

6865
10:36:43,060 --> 10:36:49,300
Uh, will I go in? Wow, I'm reacting to myself. Please don't react. There. Okay, that's more like

6866
10:36:49,300 --> 10:36:56,740
me. Hold on. Let me put chat behind me just for a moment. Okay, let's see if I can do this properly.

6867
10:36:57,540 --> 10:37:04,420
Sorry, I'm so close. Okay, let me move my water out of the way so I can at least attempt to do

6868
10:37:04,420 --> 10:37:10,340
something mildly professional for once in my life. Okay? Once in my life, I did something

6869
10:37:10,420 --> 10:37:11,780
a little bit. Oh, maybe a little bit.

6870
10:37:18,740 --> 10:37:30,100
It's okay to be sleeping. It's been a while since you've rested. Well, really, okay?

6871
10:37:30,980 --> 10:37:32,980
Shhh.

6872
10:37:35,860 --> 10:37:42,740
Slowly, your phone. Slow, slow, slow.

6873
10:37:46,020 --> 10:37:52,820
And your muscles relax. Slow, slow, slow.

6874
10:37:53,620 --> 10:38:04,260
And your brain is quiet. Slow, slow, slow.

6875
10:38:06,980 --> 10:38:12,500
Good name, but don't be stingy. Until the morning.

6876
10:38:12,580 --> 10:38:24,020
Did I do it? Did I do it right? Slow, slow, slow.

6877
10:38:25,220 --> 10:38:30,740
Until the slumber you fall, I tell you. I don't know if I was too close because I might hold.

6878
10:38:30,980 --> 10:38:37,300
But I need to show her. Seems like you did.

6879
10:38:40,020 --> 10:38:43,860
A little sleepy moment. Thank you so much. Good night.

6880
10:38:50,740 --> 10:38:53,780
I just woke up. Can I put you to sleep again?

6881
10:38:54,100 --> 10:39:03,060
You did great, good girl. You can't catch me off guard. I've already been called good girl.

6882
10:39:03,060 --> 10:39:08,660
Good luck getting me in subspace. I'm in dumb space. When I do hypnosis, I feel very dumb.

6883
10:39:13,700 --> 10:39:18,500
It's early in the morning. We need a bedtime ASMR. Absolutely. I am more than open to that.

6884
10:39:18,580 --> 10:39:26,580
We can absolutely do bedtime ASMR. Am I allowed to go for a tinkle and a cup of tea as my voice is

6885
10:39:26,580 --> 10:39:33,460
croaking like a frog? And then we'll just ramble until the 12 hours? Does that sound like a deal?

6886
10:39:37,060 --> 10:39:38,420
You made my boss fall asleep.

6887
10:39:38,820 --> 10:39:49,700
Super early. Hi, Stronny. Tanner is in... I'm getting a frog.

6888
10:39:54,740 --> 10:40:00,660
Thank you very much for the tiff. I'm glad you liked it. Oh no, my Elden Ring. My stream elements

6889
10:40:00,660 --> 10:40:05,780
is gone. So I can't freaking shoot you. Stream elements. Stream elements are so finicky sometimes.

6890
10:40:09,380 --> 10:40:12,100
Oh, I'm already logged in. Go to my dashboard right now.

6891
10:40:14,180 --> 10:40:19,860
Let's try that again. Shall we? My fraud, my fraud phone call. I can't believe that they're not

6892
10:40:19,860 --> 10:40:25,860
getting any, not getting it from me. Thank you, Beryl, for the tip. I appreciate it. I'm glad.

6893
10:40:27,540 --> 10:40:34,340
For our good dumb, keep it up, mom. Yeah. Right, I'm going to very quickly go make a cup of tea

6894
10:40:34,420 --> 10:40:38,900
and do a quick tinkle. You are... I'm actually going to pin my...

6895
10:40:43,300 --> 10:40:51,460
Rain cloud. Please rest well, rain. Okay. And sleep well. I'm not gonna force you to talk. Okay,

6896
10:40:52,580 --> 10:41:01,620
I'm actually going to pin my... Any questions? Question mark? Did that work? Yeah, it did work.

6897
10:41:01,620 --> 10:41:06,660
I'm going to pin it. So you're welcome to think it, but please rest well, rain. You work so hard.

6898
10:41:07,380 --> 10:41:12,020
And you did fantastic. Hi, Stronny Tenors, Polk. Happy first week. This was my first rain.

6899
10:41:12,660 --> 10:41:19,300
Oh my god, thank you so much. There's so kind of you. Oh my gosh. I'm glad I could take your rate,

6900
10:41:19,300 --> 10:41:22,820
Cherry. Am I allowed to say that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I'm not allowed to say that, but I'm

6901
10:41:22,820 --> 10:41:29,940
glad I could take it anyway. Okay, I've pinned that. I'm going to go make a cup of tea. I will be

6902
10:41:29,940 --> 10:41:33,860
roughly three minutes because it takes three minutes for the kettle to boil. It takes three

6903
10:41:33,860 --> 10:41:37,860
minutes for the kettle to boil, yeah? So you're welcome to ask me any questions of any variety.

6904
10:41:39,380 --> 10:41:42,900
But please sleep well, rain cloud. Thank you for the rate. I really appreciate that.

6905
10:41:42,900 --> 10:41:48,820
I need to add you on Discord, actually. I need DM, the whole Umi Plus squad, actually,

6906
10:41:48,820 --> 10:41:54,500
and get everyone on Discord. And then once I have access to you on Discord, the possibility.

6907
10:41:55,460 --> 10:42:04,180
Right, I'll very quickly mute and I'll go and make a cup of tea, okay? Okay, cup of tea time.

6908
10:42:04,180 --> 10:42:10,180
Tea time. Oh wait, I'll do that. I'll close my eyes first. Oh wait, close eyes. I'm not very smart

6909
10:42:10,180 --> 10:42:12,180
whenever I do that. Never mind.

6910
10:49:54,500 --> 10:49:57,620
That time we brushed our teeth and I was like fully ready to go bed.

6911
10:49:59,940 --> 10:50:06,980
Yeah, yeah, remember that time? Yeah, okay. I entered the room with a cup of tea. My tongue's

6912
10:50:06,980 --> 10:50:12,660
sticking out. I was like, yeah, what time? Yeah. I mean, do we need a brush or two

6913
10:50:12,660 --> 10:50:16,180
twice now? I don't know. You're not really supposed to brush it like too much.

6914
10:50:16,980 --> 10:50:26,900
Yeah, I just got caught up. Apparently, shebe's alternative Twitter is over 10K followers,

6915
10:50:26,900 --> 10:50:31,780
so what the heck just happened whilst I was streaming? I don't know what I've missed,

6916
10:50:31,780 --> 10:50:41,300
but congrats girls, oh my gosh. Right, shall we? Shall we get to the bottom of it?

6917
10:50:41,540 --> 10:50:44,260
Oh, she offered feet for 10K.

6918
10:50:46,340 --> 10:50:51,540
Shut up. My toes are out right now. Hold on, I'm putting Goop on my toes right now

6919
10:50:51,540 --> 10:51:01,780
for the money shot and everything. She has lovely feet. True. Yeah, she left the containment zone.

6920
10:51:01,780 --> 10:51:10,020
Oh, okay, she componds, she componds. Right, let me refresh these marshmallows.

6921
10:51:10,020 --> 10:51:12,340
Ooh, I got 20 more questions. Thank you for all the questions.

6922
10:51:17,300 --> 10:51:21,380
Some reason it shows marshmallows from like a week ago at the top. I don't know what that means.

6923
10:51:21,380 --> 10:51:25,460
Does that mean someone's verified is like put it up there on purpose? I don't know how it works.

6924
10:51:28,900 --> 10:51:34,340
My stream disconnected. Why does OBS do that? I said OBS disconnected. I'm still here.

6925
10:51:35,060 --> 10:51:40,980
Stream. You give me a heart attack every time you freaking do that. Please don't do that.

6926
10:51:43,060 --> 10:51:47,940
Oh, I just get notifications that says OBS, you've disconnected. I'm like, please no.

6927
10:51:49,220 --> 10:51:54,820
Please no. I'm trying to make it to the 12 hour mark, please, please. We're only one hour away.

6928
10:51:56,980 --> 10:52:01,540
Someone said, oh yeah, you can request me to say stuff on my accent by the way. Someone says,

6929
10:52:01,540 --> 10:52:12,500
please can you say ravioli in a seductive tone? Ravioli in a seductive, ravioli, ravioli, ravioli.

6930
10:52:14,260 --> 10:52:17,940
That little sleep hypnosis thing you did was amazing. I'm convinced you'd be amazing at a

6931
10:52:17,940 --> 10:52:22,900
meditation type sleep bottle. Yes, I want to do like bedtime hypnosis stuff as well, like completely

6932
10:52:22,900 --> 10:52:27,860
like fine on the table. You haven't even started your hypnosis content yet and you're already

6933
10:52:27,860 --> 10:52:35,780
infiltrating my mind by turning my internal monologue scotch. I can't wait for you to turn my brain

6934
10:52:35,780 --> 10:52:45,540
into your bin, into your female doll. Oh my. Ever since you've debuted, I've gone from a man lost

6935
10:52:45,540 --> 10:52:51,940
in a desert drawing of thirst to one drowning in a flood of nonstop good times. Yes. And all I want

6936
10:52:51,940 --> 10:52:57,060
to do is just close my eyes and let the waves take me. Would you drag me into the depths? I want

6937
10:52:57,060 --> 10:53:04,980
you to. I'm glad you can have good times here. It was, it was dry for a while but I hope, I hope

6938
10:53:04,980 --> 10:53:11,860
it's good times here, good vibes. Yeah. We go swimming together, you know. I playfully dunk

6939
10:53:11,860 --> 10:53:17,780
your head under the water a little bit. Just playfully. And no other reason. No other lower

6940
10:53:17,780 --> 10:53:25,460
related reason. It was awfully cold in the depths but now we're in warmer waters I think you could

6941
10:53:25,460 --> 10:53:33,860
say. Can you run from Prime Minister of Australia? So at least through, if it's bad ideas, it sounds

6942
10:53:33,860 --> 10:53:41,140
nice coming from me but I've not even been granted rights into the country yet. There, there is a

6943
10:53:41,140 --> 10:53:48,580
timeline where I get rejected and I can't, I have to go back to Scotland and I can't run the business.

6944
10:53:48,580 --> 10:53:55,300
Let's hope we're not on that timeline. That would be terrible. Could you imagine if I got kicked out

6945
10:53:55,300 --> 10:54:07,540
of, oh my god. Munga, munga. Uh, hi, Strony. I don't know if it's been answered already. It's okay to

6946
10:54:07,540 --> 10:54:12,340
ask something you're not sure that's been answered. It's not possible for someone to be here all the

6947
10:54:12,340 --> 10:54:16,260
time so please don't ever be afraid to ask a question you think that's already been answered.

6948
10:54:16,900 --> 10:54:23,060
It's not possible for you to be here all the time. I know, I know it's terrible but it's not possible.

6949
10:54:24,020 --> 10:54:28,660
Sorry if you did but I just want to know if you're interested in the game Lost Planet 2. It's on

6950
10:54:28,660 --> 10:54:32,580
Xbox and I think you'd like it. Could easily play the whole thing in one stream. Also, you

6951
10:54:32,580 --> 10:54:39,220
played Elden Ring. Would you be open to playing Armor Core 6? Armor Core 6 has been popping up over,

6952
10:54:40,420 --> 10:54:44,980
I've heard the name a few times now. Love your streams that I can't wait to bounce those hypnotic

6953
10:54:44,980 --> 10:54:54,260
eyes back on you. Stinky. Armor Core 6. I don't know what it is but it keeps coming up.

6954
10:54:55,140 --> 10:55:00,580
Lost Planet 2. I should actually write down game ideas because I trust your guys's like

6955
10:55:01,300 --> 10:55:04,260
suggestions over anything that I could possibly come up with.

6956
10:55:04,980 --> 10:55:12,420
8c6. It's phenomenal. It's great. It's really good. Highly rated game.

6957
10:55:14,260 --> 10:55:22,340
Not my. Every strongy tone has it's synced up. No my default. I feel like my default and I'm

6958
10:55:22,340 --> 10:55:27,460
like that and I'm all monotone. Like you can't even understand. Lost Planet 2 is an OG Xbox game.

6959
10:55:27,460 --> 10:55:32,980
How did I never come across it then? I don't know when it came out. Maybe it was still at

6960
10:55:32,980 --> 10:55:38,500
the stage where like so I used to get attached to one game and when Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

6961
10:55:38,500 --> 10:55:47,940
came out like I hardly got any new games. I got Skyrim, I got Black Ops, AC Brotherhood and the rate

6962
10:55:47,940 --> 10:55:58,740
of like new games like went down astronomically. If it's probes of 2006, 2008 and then Armor Core

6963
10:55:58,900 --> 10:56:03,780
6. I'll definitely, these games keep coming up and I trust your guys's judgment.

6964
10:56:03,780 --> 10:56:06,740
Hi strongy, I was curious if you would follow guys's chat one day.

6965
10:56:08,180 --> 10:56:13,860
Yeah, of course we're doing the jelly bean game. Are you silly? Are you being a silly sausage? Of

6966
10:56:13,860 --> 10:56:19,780
course we're playing the jelly bean game again. How else are you gonna touch me and grab me and

6967
10:56:19,780 --> 10:56:30,500
hold me back? You guys wouldn't stop grabbing me. You all grabbed me. You stinky stinker things.

6968
10:56:31,300 --> 10:56:35,860
Ah my calibration is having a hard time today. Hold on. Let me re-calibrate.

6969
10:56:39,060 --> 10:56:46,100
Hopefully my mouth stops wiggling. Okay it's not wiggling anymore. Jelly bean game.

6970
10:56:47,060 --> 10:56:52,580
We do what? So in the jelly bean game you can like grab opponents and hold them back

6971
10:56:52,580 --> 10:56:59,060
to like stop them from jumping to the objective or whatever and I used to have to beg. I was so

6972
10:56:59,060 --> 10:57:06,580
bad at the game. I would basically have to beg till people would hold back to let me through the

6973
10:57:06,580 --> 10:57:14,100
first level because I ended up losing it so many times that I wasn't playing the game and I respect

6974
10:57:14,100 --> 10:57:21,300
it and you guys play because I was that freaking bad at the game. That is so much fun. So yes you

6975
10:57:21,300 --> 10:57:29,220
will absolutely be playing that again. I will always do like a stream snipe game every month.

6976
10:57:30,180 --> 10:57:36,900
One that's like public and one I do prioritize free to play games. Unfortunately I've started off

6977
10:57:36,900 --> 10:57:42,820
a rune scoop which normally premium is the only way to play it so I've picked a bit pearly.

6978
10:57:43,780 --> 10:57:48,820
I do apologize but I would like to get 99 cooking and it would be fun to kind of like

6979
10:57:48,820 --> 10:57:55,620
achieve goals along the way. So going strong girls. Strony what type of fan are you like the most?

6980
10:57:58,820 --> 10:58:05,380
Any. Like whatever inspires you. Like some people do like a meme funny moment. Like I uploaded a short

6981
10:58:06,100 --> 10:58:12,500
and like in the short I was like and yes before you ask and I went back in the like the bagpipes

6982
10:58:12,500 --> 10:58:18,020
and like the Scottish flag appear behind me and then someone liked it so much they basically made

6983
10:58:18,020 --> 10:58:23,780
a Scottish beam come out of my mouth and like the first panel was me going and then the second

6984
10:58:23,780 --> 10:58:29,220
panel was like I was like throwing this Scottish beam out of my mouth and it reminded me there's a

6985
10:58:29,220 --> 10:58:36,020
trend on how it's the Mika world and she goes Mika no no this time you've been waiting for see

6986
10:58:36,020 --> 10:58:43,060
two one Mika Mika beam and it reminded me of that and it's so good. Like whatever you enjoy

6987
10:58:43,060 --> 10:58:46,580
like if you enjoy meme make a meme if you enjoy the other side of things you're more than welcome

6988
10:58:46,580 --> 10:58:53,860
to make the other side of things because I like that stuff too. And yeah like anything 10 hours

6989
10:58:53,860 --> 10:59:00,660
deep let's go yeah we're gonna make it a 12 hour stream uh so I'm just ranting ranting rambling

6990
10:59:01,220 --> 10:59:06,340
for the last uh hour hour last hour. I've got a little cup of tea don't know if you can hear

6991
10:59:06,340 --> 10:59:12,340
my nails on it. I'm just waiting for it to cool down before I can sip it. Stroney any chance of

6992
10:59:12,340 --> 10:59:19,540
you making a 2D platform video game in the future that's so specific why are you wanting to bounce

6993
10:59:19,540 --> 10:59:28,020
on me in 2D? I'm I'm not making a video game no. I have plans to make video game in the future

6994
10:59:28,020 --> 10:59:34,900
but that's the future future like now meow. What should a lad do if he makes a fan made album?

6995
10:59:34,900 --> 10:59:41,940
What should uh sorry make a fan made album? What should he send us general or art?

6996
10:59:42,500 --> 10:59:51,780
What does that mean? Fan made album? Album? Like a music or am I being dumb? I'm in it for the

6997
10:59:51,780 --> 10:59:56,580
long haul today I'm here we go I'm oh please don't stay up if it's gonna be bad for your health

6998
10:59:56,580 --> 11:00:05,940
I don't want you to do anything bad for health okay see me I can be up for 12 hour stream because

6999
11:00:06,660 --> 11:00:08,100

7000
11:00:12,260 --> 11:00:20,580
a rap stuff oh my god can you do a diss track on me? Stroney cuttles more like Stroney can't make

7001
11:00:20,580 --> 11:00:32,420
her mind up. Uttles on her 15th persona. Muttles got tape on her tape the only reason she's a

7002
11:00:32,420 --> 11:00:38,900
VTuber is to give herself boobies because she ain't got any in real life yeah whoo diss tracks

7003
11:00:38,900 --> 11:00:45,380
Stroney diss track no the diss tracks yeah that's right you're getting diss tracks again oh I just

7004
11:00:45,380 --> 11:00:52,740
punched my knuckle against the desk by accident someone says I kneel you are too powerful so much

7005
11:00:52,740 --> 11:01:01,700
kneeling I like it do it again it is humbling to know someone like you exist I've never dumped so

7006
11:01:01,700 --> 11:01:10,820
much ink before within a span of a week and from it so happy from watching you and the girls I

7007
11:01:10,820 --> 11:01:16,340
hope for your success and it's one of the few I feel that is deserved oh thank you so much thank

7008
11:01:16,340 --> 11:01:23,860
you for spilling your ink I do like hearing about ink spilling like why yes maybe I am a V sucky after

7009
11:01:24,020 --> 11:01:35,780
oh maybe there is sucky by blood the pause after hearing where I live it smells like freshly baked

7010
11:01:35,780 --> 11:01:40,180
cookies because I'm near a cookie factory and I'm and I'm already awake for today we're still going

7011
11:01:40,180 --> 11:01:46,260
strong oh that's dangerous for your health it's dangerous to be awake for more than like 16 hours

7012
11:01:46,260 --> 11:01:54,740
I think is when it's bad like your brain function your cognitive function goes down like big big

7013
11:01:57,140 --> 11:02:04,500
I knew it velar is going to be my oval my version of meet the grams will be meet the indulgers

7014
11:02:05,220 --> 11:02:11,380
what did you think about the generation name indulge because if I told you technically if I

7015
11:02:11,380 --> 11:02:18,580
told you a secret this is a secret for only who watch this stream right now um gen one's name

7016
11:02:18,580 --> 11:02:28,900
indulge plays into gen two and three um and if we do get to three gens oh I'm gonna be so excited

7017
11:02:28,900 --> 11:02:38,820
because to reveal the full names because they all play into each other and I'm so excited I wonder

7018
11:02:38,900 --> 11:02:43,220
if anyone could guess I don't I think it's impossible to get there's too many variations like

7019
11:02:44,420 --> 11:02:50,180
someone says is there a chance for a stream of a software game other than Elden Ring I don't think

7020
11:02:50,180 --> 11:02:58,740
I can get any help in the other Elden Rings though however I think she be as interested in Bloodborne

7021
11:03:02,900 --> 11:03:08,100
but unfortunately I'm not very good and the reason I like Elden Ring so much is because you

7022
11:03:08,100 --> 11:03:17,300
guys can come in and help me but I'm not good on my own um three gens worth the tubers I will become

7023
11:03:17,300 --> 11:03:24,340
a husk I'll become a husk honestly maybe we can guess after the second gen

7024
11:03:24,420 --> 11:03:29,940
um

7025
11:03:33,140 --> 11:03:39,700
oh no you can't guess it because there's two secret words that aren't present

7026
11:03:40,580 --> 11:03:48,340
it it forms a sentence basically all three gens perform a sentence that perfectly encapsulates

7027
11:03:48,340 --> 11:03:57,140
won't be where it is indulge marionette and you're like nah yeah you're no the secret words

7028
11:03:57,140 --> 11:04:01,460
makes it impossible just wanted to drop one more marrow I've watched all the velo girls and well

7029
11:04:01,460 --> 11:04:07,780
I like them a lot you're my oh thank you are you sure I'm your oh she though like I'm not gonna say

7030
11:04:07,780 --> 11:04:13,460
anything but like Emmys T's and Oof A.C's accent like I'm not killed and she sounds so

7031
11:04:14,100 --> 11:04:21,140
fucking adorable and her accent I wish I could copy it but I can't why is she irish I see why are

7032
11:04:21,140 --> 11:04:28,740
you irish I don't know I just love the way she sounds but I feel like I'm doing a terrible

7033
11:04:29,300 --> 11:04:34,580
that's terrible you have your own accent power power

7034
11:04:35,380 --> 11:04:44,820
sure well the sentence will look good but what gen no I am not I am absolutely not doing any further

7035
11:04:45,620 --> 11:04:50,100
so there some people were like are you doing a spin-off gen are you doing like a safer work

7036
11:04:50,100 --> 11:04:59,300
variation no I've absolutely no interest I am exhausted I took so much HP damage getting gen

7037
11:04:59,300 --> 11:05:06,660
one out I am very thankful to say that if gen two and three do happen the HP damage is reduced

7038
11:05:06,660 --> 11:05:15,700
significantly because I learned so much I learned so much and when you do the first time you do it

7039
11:05:15,700 --> 11:05:23,860
it's so hard but anytime after it just gets easier but I am I have no interest I feel like absolutely

7040
11:05:23,860 --> 11:05:31,140
no shade or anything to any other VTuber agency if you start throwing gen after gen it is very

7041
11:05:31,140 --> 11:05:38,260
clear you do not give an absolute rats arse about the content for your girls and it's just it's

7042
11:05:38,260 --> 11:05:44,260
such a shame that those girls put faith in you as an agency and your response is throw another gen

7043
11:05:44,260 --> 11:05:51,140
out throw another no absolutely no no very disappointing I don't like that that's just me

7044
11:05:51,700 --> 11:05:57,540
uh you like instantly became my or she I don't have an endurance for long streamers but I really

11:06:28,500 --> 11:06:36,420
on real life um I have rambling ASMR coming out where I'm just kind of talking about stuff that's

7050
11:06:36,420 --> 11:06:48,500
happening now that's me if you mean the small pp audio then uh there's an anon that's very passionate

7051
11:06:48,500 --> 11:06:55,220
about it and he sent me a prompt and well he didn't he didn't actually even mean to make it

7052
11:06:55,220 --> 11:06:59,220
into a script or anything he just sent me a prompt of what he liked and I was like you know what

7053
11:06:59,220 --> 11:07:04,260
you know what I'll make it into something as so your guys are more than welcome to use marshmallows

7054
11:07:04,260 --> 11:07:08,660
to put down your things because it unironically can inspire me to make like an entire script

7055
11:07:09,380 --> 11:07:14,340
um I am happy to take inspiration I'll yonk it I like reading your deep dark fantasy

7056
11:07:14,820 --> 11:07:19,060
I want to hit them with a diss track I know but also I don't want to go into them and be like

7057
11:07:19,060 --> 11:07:25,620
public anime number one in veilerland I talk a lot of hmm but I'm such a little teddy bear

7058
11:07:27,140 --> 11:07:33,140
nah it's all funny I have to admit something I fall asleep to your voice during streams

7059
11:07:33,140 --> 11:07:36,660
only for a little bit like 30 minutes to an hour the volume doesn't matter your voice just knocks

7060
11:07:36,660 --> 11:07:42,340

7062

the unmentionable one and I'm finally feeling better I hope to see many more streams from you and the girls

7064
11:08:04,420 --> 11:08:17,140
someone's signed this with their name sorry I think this might be um

7065
11:08:19,460 --> 11:08:24,260
uh I'm hope you're okay and I'm glad you feel better you're starting to feel more like yourself

7066
11:08:25,060 --> 11:08:28,900
sorry you've signed it and I don't know if I should see your name out so for respect I'm not

7069
11:08:41,380 --> 11:08:50,820
you my refling gave me the courage seriously why the refling I don't know maybe it's because he gives

7070
11:08:50,820 --> 11:08:58,420
me courage hi stroney saying this is the Scott so when I say this you know it's not just because

7071
11:08:58,420 --> 11:09:02,900
of the accent I love your voice listen to you up on stream is my favorite part of your stream and

7072
11:09:02,900 --> 11:09:08,100
when you talk gently it gives me tingles I'm really looking forward to the ASMR wait I can give you

7073
11:09:08,100 --> 11:09:14,820
tingles just when I be a bit more gentler in the morning that's interesting normally I like I only

7074
11:09:14,820 --> 11:09:22,500
happen in the the thing the thingy goodbye those who are sleeping I gotta go finish up work have

7075
11:09:22,500 --> 11:09:30,340
good day yeah have a good day thanks for hanging uh like yeah definitely a not safe

7076
11:09:32,660 --> 11:09:39,780
what are you saying read out your own risk but are you gonna do a hmm audio involving oh

7077
11:09:42,580 --> 11:09:48,900
let's call it joystick and we'll take the first three letters are you gonna do hip no joystick

7078
11:09:49,620 --> 11:09:56,740
uh yes it's one of the main things I'm interested in I want to take full control

7079
11:10:00,500 --> 11:10:06,740
the question is can I put you under though I'm I'm a bit unskilled at the under part it's scary to

7080
11:10:06,740 --> 11:10:12,500
put you under because I'm not sure how good I am at it and as well I don't know if the accent is

7081
11:10:12,500 --> 11:10:18,500
actually a debuff on putting you under a spell or the control type section of it so I'm a bit worried

7082
11:10:19,460 --> 11:10:24,900
we'll see what happens as I said I'm learning and you guys have been fantastic and it will be

7083
11:10:24,900 --> 11:10:29,700
like you guys are always fantastic and give me like a lot of space it'll take time to get

7084
11:10:30,580 --> 11:10:37,380
to get there I'm good at pretending I believe in you I love that you're

11:17:37,780 --> 11:17:49,140
it's over for you you crave the rolling ours you crave the in luck and most of all you crave the

7146
11:17:49,220 --> 11:17:54,580
smell of iron brew on the breath of the woman you've just kissed

7147
11:17:57,700 --> 11:18:02,340
you're you've been scot-pilled and there's no turning back

7148
11:18:04,340 --> 11:18:13,460
the peak I'll say oh should she still go ahead yeah we've got another t-minus 40 minutes uh is

7149
11:18:13,540 --> 11:18:18,340
mercy going to be online in 40 minutes I never thought about that

7150
11:18:21,780 --> 11:18:28,180
already had a taste for the Scottish accent it's uh bettish I'm sure no one

7151
11:18:28,980 --> 11:18:34,820
but found out when I have my scot-pilled oh yeah yeah she's still online okay um before I go offline

7152
11:18:34,820 --> 11:18:40,420
please remind me to make sure that mercy's like still actually going to be online if not I'm probably

7153
11:18:40,420 --> 11:18:49,460
going to redirect you into one of her songs I'll make you listen to ac's furry cover thing

7154
11:18:50,980 --> 11:18:58,660
xt nestle pouses on your ooh you so warm I love emmy's emmy aces

7155
11:18:58,660 --> 11:19:03,380
frankly the right the reason why I get ac and emmy mixed up all the time is it because they both

7156
11:19:03,380 --> 11:19:08,500
begin with I is because I used to call them the twins in development they were called the twins

7157
11:19:08,580 --> 11:19:13,700
in development I know they're not twins they I just called them twins it just happened okay

7158
11:19:13,700 --> 11:19:18,980
so emmy and ac always get referred to each other by accident now there's few problems with my

7159
11:19:20,980 --> 11:19:29,140
if you had a chance to change your oh I changed forget changing fate I put it into my own hands

7160
11:19:29,700 --> 11:19:37,060
and I am strong it calls the cullfish of the war

7161
11:19:40,820 --> 11:19:45,220
sending them out to say that you and emmy's are my favorites it means incredibly talented

7162
11:19:45,220 --> 11:19:49,780
and entertaining and she's an absolute sucky mom but there's something about you that makes you

7163
11:19:50,580 --> 11:19:56,100
so easy to listen to it's probably because you can tell how low IQ I am so I make you feel safe

7164
11:19:56,900 --> 11:20:04,580
see mersey's a dork so you lure your guard around her but me because I'm brain dead yeah

7165
11:20:04,580 --> 11:20:11,860

warning for stream let's see how far I can read into this before we can

7167
11:20:18,900 --> 11:20:25,060
as you stare into your reeflings eyes to hypnotize them you get a little too close to one and catch

7168
11:20:25,140 --> 11:20:34,260
your reflection in the eye you suddenly feel tired and a desire to bend to their oh good girl

cuddles you want to give everything to your little reeflings stop oh my god you're no I can't read that

11:20:53,460 --> 11:20:58,020
no I can't read that no I can't read that it's gonna change my brain thinking right now I can't

11:21:14,500 --> 11:21:24,020
my favorite pokemon oh you can't make me pick oh there's so many I like creepy pokemon I like

7176
11:21:24,020 --> 11:21:31,940
when they look cute and creepy who wrote that no no no subspace stop it we're not going into

7177
11:21:32,020 --> 11:21:39,700
subspace another another time but not not no subspace no subspace all right I bite it

7178
11:21:42,900 --> 11:21:47,940
because if no the problem is if I go into subspace I can't talk I literally can't talk

7179
11:21:47,940 --> 11:21:53,220
how am I supposed to entertain if I can't talk if I'm just here squealing like a little

7180
11:21:54,100 --> 11:22:05,140
picky subspace emissary reference subspace emissary reference no subspace is a thinking type

7181
11:22:06,740 --> 11:22:11,860
and it makes it really hard for me to freaking talk through it it's really freaking hard

7182
11:22:13,380 --> 11:22:20,020
no I can't talk and I need to be able to talk you can't just stare at my face while I go

7183
11:22:20,020 --> 11:22:26,900
I'm so happy that I saw you on my Twitter feed oh is that how you found me on Twitter oh maybe

7184
11:22:26,900 --> 11:22:33,140
I should actually start using Twitter then oh but I don't like using Twitter all the girls have

7185
11:22:33,140 --> 11:22:38,260
been so fantastic like I'm streaming in one hour I'm doing this I'm doing that I literally

7186
11:22:38,260 --> 11:22:45,060
have put nothing on Twitter I can't like I've used Twitter to make ASMR

7187
11:22:46,020 --> 11:22:52,340
collabs that's it I can't do it okay please please look at the Twitter please it's so

7188
11:22:56,820 --> 11:23:02,260
can't could stare at your face for an age less you underestimate what you do a karaoke stream

7189
11:23:02,260 --> 11:23:09,300
with the girls I think latency is too much for me with the girls however the girls might be able

7190
11:23:09,300 --> 11:23:15,940
to do it with one another because latency wouldn't be an issue um I have to put your stream schedule

7191
11:23:15,940 --> 11:23:21,060
on my desk to make sure I remember I'm so bad I apologize if people use Twitter for notifications

7192
11:23:21,060 --> 11:23:26,980
I adjust I don't like it I don't like it I actually don't like it I'm sorry well I'm off to work

7193
11:23:26,980 --> 11:23:34,100
good night and don't forget to wash you to brush my teeth yes I won't forget uh if it's been 30

7194
11:23:34,100 --> 11:23:37,940
minutes since I last drank yes it will be okay we'll brush your teeth right before you end

7195
11:23:37,940 --> 11:23:44,180
Twitter recently uh officially allowed the content and it's signal boosting the words

7196
11:23:44,180 --> 11:23:49,700
mentioning oh is it I'm gonna make a certain video then I've been needing to make a video

7197
11:23:49,700 --> 11:23:54,980
as a thank you for ages and I'm stalling I'm scared because maybe I should do it no no

11:23:56,740 --> 11:24:02,420
maybe yeah shimmy shimmy yeah shimmy yeah shimmy y'all

7199
11:24:04,580 --> 11:24:05,940
I wonder what I could be doing

7200
11:24:07,780 --> 11:24:11,460
and I really strongly made me have a good sleep schedule because I wake up early to watch

7201

7205
11:24:41,940 --> 11:24:48,020

11:26:15,540 --> 11:26:19,860
into the other side of content I wasn't sure how to take it at first because it's not my cup of tea

but you love being genuinely entertaining regardless wishing on but but thank you so much yes

7220
11:26:25,300 --> 11:26:30,660

what we're doing and it was like bro we're still beach over so we'll be playing games like of course

11:27:14,660 --> 11:27:18,340
but yeah well you occasionally dip into the thingy like in pdb

7230
11:27:20,740 --> 11:27:26,500
that was to paint you all up though I think everyone did a good job we all we all collectively

7231
11:27:26,500 --> 11:27:31,700
were like you know the meme that's like wait hold on maybe I can find it

7232
11:27:32,260 --> 11:27:40,580
oh yeah this was literally it

7233
11:27:44,340 --> 11:27:46,420
basically this meme if I can see the image

7234
11:27:53,220 --> 11:27:58,180
this was the meme so it was like chaos behind the scenes setting up for debut

7235
11:27:58,180 --> 11:28:02,820
but like we all came together to discuss how we're like absolutely going to destroy everyone

7236
11:28:02,820 --> 11:28:07,460
unanimously and like do all these like things to like get everyone pent up I'm not even pretending

7237
11:28:07,460 --> 11:28:12,980
otherwise like literally chaos is the top one all of us preparing for debut but when it came to

7238
11:28:12,980 --> 11:28:20,660
discussing like okay let's release the alt twitters it was that was by the pope I admire your work

7256
11:30:16,500 --> 11:30:24,900
creators you would like to collaborate with outside the group sadly I am uh very I don't know what the

7257
11:30:24,900 --> 11:30:36,100
word is if people reach out to me I am more than happy to but I feel like if I reach out then I'm

7258
11:30:37,060 --> 11:30:41,780
bothering so like the yumi plus girls will be nothing but receptive to me I absolutely adore

7259
11:30:41,780 --> 11:30:47,460
them so I'm I'm gonna try and get a collab going with them or something or ASMR or anything like

7260
11:30:47,460 --> 11:30:55,060
that um but like anyone basically the sentence if you f with me I f with you but because like

7261
11:30:56,020 --> 11:31:03,300
all strongies from um veal or like I don't want anyone feeling forced and I'm also quite

7262
11:31:05,620 --> 11:31:10,580
appropriate with certain jokes and I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable during a collab so I

7263
11:31:10,580 --> 11:31:17,300
only I don't know I'm just shy like I really like fen but I would never ask for a collab because I

7264
11:31:17,300 --> 11:31:22,820
just I I know for a fact like I would just make her uncomfortable so I'm just gonna be like thumbs up

sadly most potential clubs speak English instead of scott oh they'll never understand me well there

7268
11:31:52,580 --> 11:31:59,540
was actually something really funny um was that a zura in debut called me a fish and when we were

7269
11:31:59,540 --> 11:32:05,620
doing the mock I was with the girls like um we were doing the mock so five of us were in the voice

7270
11:32:05,620 --> 11:32:11,380
call and whoever was doing the mock went and did it um and as they were called me a fish and I was

7271
11:32:11,380 --> 11:32:18,260
like a fish in my accent and the girls were like laughing up a storm over it and I was like oh yeah

7272
11:32:18,260 --> 11:32:23,860
I freaking love it here like they're just so amazing and they they just get it but like I feel

7273
11:32:23,860 --> 11:32:28,420
like if I collabed with someone outside of veal or like they're afraid to make fun of my accent I'm

7274
11:32:28,420 --> 11:32:33,300
like no make fun of it are you joking me I say words funny someone was saying like the way I say

zeal good yeah yeah zeal good uh sir I don't know how to say sir in German

7317
11:37:41,620 --> 11:37:47,780
museo no that's french starting zero meter from your car at zero meters and getting in

7318
11:37:48,500 --> 11:37:56,020
I'm losing the ep fate on your unit falsely can you last another 20 minutes or is it over

7319
11:37:57,940 --> 11:38:02,260
it's 20 minutes putting the kettle on for you now oh thanks thanks I don't need a wee cup of tea

7320
11:38:02,260 --> 11:38:08,260
when I come in is that a threat or an offer off for real though thanks for streaming them because

7321
11:38:08,260 --> 11:38:14,660
your streams are so long yeah uh streams are completely impossible for vod watchers it's uh

7322
11:38:14,740 --> 11:38:18,100
pretty crazy unless you kind of use my streams as like something to listen in the

7323
11:38:18,100 --> 11:38:23,620
background as you work it's like impossible for vod watchers to uh get up to date

7324
11:38:25,300 --> 11:38:31,300
I always miss streams because of work oh work is so stinky you're telling me capitalism is in

7325
11:38:31,300 --> 11:38:40,420
is the reason why I don't have more ink we will destroy capitalism I want all the ink

7326
11:38:40,500 --> 11:38:47,860
like vod watchers they lose and unfortunately with a streamer like me vod watchers are very rough

7327
11:38:49,060 --> 11:38:56,260
what happens in 20 minutes I go offline we reach the 12 hour stream mark where the vod blows up

7328
11:38:56,260 --> 11:39:05,940
if I go one second after 12 12 hours so I have to go sadly oh I've been drinking cola I can't

7329
11:39:05,940 --> 11:39:15,620
brush my teeth you're not to brush your teeth for 30 minutes because of the enamel sorry we did

7330
11:39:15,620 --> 11:39:23,460
technically brush our teeth today so I didn't do a bad job just a rubbish one if it reaches 12 hours

7331
11:39:23,460 --> 11:39:30,740
weeks but literally the vod just self combusts clips will come in for the wind for these long

7332
11:39:30,740 --> 11:39:35,060
yeah it's if you ever clip a section I get to see it and send it to an editor

7333
11:39:36,420 --> 11:39:42,660
good morning good morning Europe hope you all slept well please don't explode

7334
11:39:43,300 --> 11:39:47,300

7335
11:39:47,300 --> 11:39:55,300

7337
11:40:01,780 --> 11:40:11,940
around any uh gamer words kidding kidding relax uh warning do not read on stream is that a challenge

7338
11:40:11,940 --> 11:40:20,580

7339
11:40:25,460 --> 11:40:30,020
oh well I've made a pact with Emmy if Emmy gets her not safe for work oh no I'm not

7346
11:41:03,780 --> 11:41:11,540
like a scenario type thing where I'm like all submissive in that and I don't expect it that's when

7388
11:45:44,260 --> 11:45:50,340
last that you'll play and ring with both have an accent I really love oh I think you're talking

7389
11:45:50,340 --> 11:45:57,540
about sin sister yee-ho I'm gonna be collaborating with her we're actually gonna be doing what

7390
11:45:58,260 --> 11:46:06,100
uh a shock collar I bought myself a shock collar and she got herself a shock collar and I'm going

7391
11:46:06,100 --> 11:46:12,020
to be shocking her and she's gonna be shocking me I'm so sorry I was just I don't I think I'm

7392
11:46:12,020 --> 11:46:16,980
starting to lose it mildly honestly considering how delirious I normally get at the end of the

7393
11:46:16,980 --> 11:46:22,980
stream that really wasn't that bad considering it was just an accent but if you didn't pick up on any

7394
11:46:22,980 --> 11:46:28,740
of that sin sister and myself have bought shock collars and we were going to play Elden ring

7395
11:46:28,740 --> 11:46:34,580
together and whoever causes us to lose the battle and perish we get to shock each other

7396
11:46:34,820 --> 11:46:42,180
yeah I'm gonna have a heart rate monitor I think she also has a heart rate monitor as well so

7397
11:46:42,180 --> 11:46:47,700
things are gonna get out of hand quick also we're really obnoxious streamers together

7398
11:46:48,420 --> 11:46:56,340
we don't mute to talk to chat or thank chat so if you do want to join in that stream just know

7399
11:46:56,340 --> 11:47:03,060
it's a bit of a sensory overload uh because we honestly don't mind each other um doing their thing

7400
11:47:05,060 --> 11:47:06,340
I mean it's gonna be interesting

7401
11:47:09,940 --> 11:47:13,140
Strani I know two tubers who possibly mentioned collabing

7402
11:47:16,660 --> 11:47:19,620
oh my god imagine naming them in marshmallow so I can reach out to them

7403
11:47:20,500 --> 11:47:23,220
only if they're shown indication though I don't want to offend anyone

7404
11:47:27,620 --> 11:47:31,860
okay I think that's enough cola for one day it's actually gonna be my bedtime

7405
11:47:31,860 --> 11:47:37,700

7414
11:48:40,500 --> 11:48:49,140
starts to shut down now this is when you're getting cognitive the irony that I start out on that word

7415
11:48:49,140 --> 11:48:55,460
this is when your cognitive function slows down after the 14 hour mark I take a sip of water

7416
11:48:55,460 --> 11:48:57,140
please hydrate if you have water with you

7417
