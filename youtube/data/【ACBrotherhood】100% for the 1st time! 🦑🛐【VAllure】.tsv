0	9000	What's that? Hold on, hold on, you put the light onto the fucking tracking thing.
9000	12000	Ah, it's blinding! It's blinding, it's looking good.
12000	16000	Me? Hmm, why do I need to wear glasses? Also me, because blasted.
16000	20000	About, like, one minute late, she hates us.
20000	24000	You stop that, you naughty Nellie.
24000	27000	You naughty soft fans.
27000	31000	You naughty ballbags. I actually don't say that word, that's fine.
31000	33000	Well, I mean, that's another word.
33000	35000	Uh...
35000	37000	Um...
39000	44000	Are we here? Hello? Hello? Hi! Hello America! Hiya! Hiya!
44000	46000	Oh my god, what's that?
46000	51000	We get to do another full day of Assassin's Creed.
51000	54000	And I get to, yeah, ease as much as I like.
54000	59000	Uh, I do want to say I am very thankful to PayPal support.
59000	64000	Yay! PayPal unblocked this.
64000	70000	Because if you didn't know, yesterday, you guys unanimously, at the same time,
70000	73000	supported, like, everyone with donos.
73000	76000	And PayPal was like, halt, halt.
76000	82000	This account has been paused because what on earth are all these things?
82000	86000	And we literally had to go, oh, hello there PayPal.
86000	88000	Uh, we're streaming.
88000	91000	Uh, we're beach homers. Please unblock.
91000	93000	So you can support my daughters.
93000	94000	Uh...
96000	98000	Good morning!
98000	101000	Good evening!
101000	106000	And most of all, good afternoon reeflings!
106000	110000	Are you ready to fuck up your sleep pattern?
111000	115080	Do do d, d, d, d, d, d, d.
115080	119120	Do, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd, dd, d,d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd, d, dd, d, dd, d, d, d, d, d, d, dd,
119120	121540	How are you?
121540	125000	And you did? It was Aisy looking after you.
127000	129000	Did anyone touch your tummy?
129000	133000	Don't lie, Aisy's best design element is her tummy, her navel.
133000	137000	If you didn't know, a belly button is also a refer to as a navel.
137000	141240	I understand you can't hear the background music, oh I've seen some creepy brotherhood right now.
141240	143240	Ask that memean, erm.
143240	149240	I apologise for being a whole 60 seconds late.
149240	151740	Do you want to know why I'm 60 seconds late?
151740	154240	Cos I was trying to arrange another Ace Markalab.
154240	159740	Um, I've recorded one with Mimosa, I need to edit it.
159740	165500	I do not know how long today's stream is gonna be, so feel free to strap in.
165500	168500	And if not, I'll be the one wearing the strap in this relationship.
168500	171500	Ah, that's terrible, absolutely terrible, just started.
171500	175500	Erm, but it's been fantastic.
175500	179500	I should hopefully not miss any freaking donations.
179500	182500	Like I did yesterday, cos I was absolutely awful.
182500	187500	I just kept missing everything left and right.
187500	191500	Everything left and right.
191500	194500	Left and right.
194500	196500	Oh, that's not how I can read.
196500	198500	Okay, there we go.
198500	201500	Woo, five hours of sleeping, eight hours of work, and we're so bad.
201500	204500	Oh, please rest, okay.
204500	209500	I can, I literally, I brushed my teeth, I had a shower.
209500	214500	Right, well I'll tell you something gross whilst we jump back into the action.
214500	216500	I'll tell you something nasty.
217500	220500	Why can I not hear my game?
223500	225500	Hello? Headset?
225500	227500	Headset?
227500	230500	Headset, I know there's, hello?
230500	237500	Okay, I cannot hear any sound and the game isn't coming out of my fucking desktop.
237500	239500	Are you fucking serious?
239500	242500	By the way, this game lives up to the test of time.
243500	246500	Are we being true?
246500	249500	Why is it not coming out of desktop?
249500	252500	Is this a fucking joke?
252500	256500	How could this have been so scuffed?
256500	258500	I can't hear the game either.
258500	261500	Okay, fantastic.
261500	263500	Fantastic!
263500	265500	No, seriously.
265500	268500	The tips link is messed up again.
268500	270500	Are you joking? God, I'm so scuffed.
270500	272500	Um...
277500	284500	I am speechless on why the game is not playing through the desktop audio right now.
287500	290500	Hold on, let me start clicking stuff and see what happens.
290500	293500	Okay, I need to start clicking stuff.
294500	301500	Why would the game not be detectable via the desktop audio?
301500	304500	I am totally not raging right now.
311500	314500	Let's check, let's check.
314500	318500	Right, okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me click.
318500	323500	Rule one, if something doesn't work, close the game and open it again.
323500	327500	Because why would it not be detectable on desktop?
327500	329500	That's rule one of gaming.
329500	331500	Okay, so I've closed it.
331500	333500	It's now closed, you can't see none of it.
339500	342500	Also, I listened back.
342500	346500	I was watching a bit of my own brotherhood gameplay.
346500	350500	My voice actually doesn't sound that messed up,
350500	355500	but I can hear it and feel it myself how messed up it is.
364500	367500	Yep, again, no audio.
367500	372500	If I have to go offline to troubleshoot this, I'm gonna be so mad.
372500	375500	Why? I didn't do anything.
375500	380500	I, Mercy, has literally made a short about this exact scenario.
380500	381500	I cannot make this up.
381500	386500	Mercy has a short coming out later about this exact situation.
394500	401500	Game, audio output settings, hold on, hold on, hold on, manage input devices,
401500	404500	output devices, sound mixer, is it sound mixer?
404500	407500	Input, yep, output, yep.
407500	409500	Why the frick?
409500	413500	Why the frick fracked Italy deck, tic-tac, petty whack?
413500	417500	Would this not be coming out?
417500	420500	I think I actually have to go offline to frickin' jumpshoot this.
420500	422500	I'm not even kidding.
423500	428500	I can't believe this.
428500	431500	Are you joking?
442500	446500	It only took me seven minutes to start the stream!
447500	453500	Oh, 49% total synchronization.
453500	458500	Oh, I guess we are doing 12 hours then if I'm only at 49%.
458500	460500	Let's go.
460500	463500	Literally, Mercy made a short about this.
463500	468500	I cannot wait for the short to come out so you guys can be like, oh my god.
468500	471500	Oh my god, she was right.
472500	478500	If you are not up to scratch, please do not worry
478500	483500	because we have successfully finished campaign mode.
483500	488500	We are currently playing Landlord Simulator 2 by all of the buildings at the moment.
488500	493500	We are now doing the kind of side quest-esque missions.
493500	500500	We are about to do a very sad mission for the auditory family.
500500	503500	Me, I'm still here.
503500	506500	Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.
506500	509500	I hope all is good.
509500	513500	I believe Asakul is the only other member live at this moment.
513500	516500	But as always, when another member goes live,
516500	525500	I will force you to go insane to her stream.
525500	530500	Okay, here we go.
530500	535500	I do not normally do this so I'm not too familiar with what happens next.
540500	543500	I think Asi is going offline.
546500	548500	That's Leonardo.
548500	551500	That's Leonardo's voice.
556500	558500	Desmond's heart rate is increasing.
558500	560500	I'm administering a sedative.
560500	562500	No, the missing data may be there.
562500	564500	The piece of Eden is useless until we have-
564500	566500	Oh, I don't remember much of this.
566500	568500	Yes, William.
568500	571500	Yes, William, congrats if your name's William.
571500	573500	Any Williams in her?
576500	578500	Eh?
581500	583500	Eh?
583500	585500	The Da Vinci-
585500	587500	Eh, Da Vinci- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
587500	589500	The Da Vinci Disappearance.
591500	593500	Did you know?
594500	596500	I remember.
601500	603500	Leonardo.
604500	606500	Good friend.
606500	608500	Thank you.
613500	616500	I see you're reading Super Chess at the moment.
616500	618500	Wait, she got monetized?
618500	620500	She couldn't have.
620500	622500	I didn't link that.
622500	624500	Did you mean Donation?
628500	630500	No, they were doing- I was gonna say.
630500	632500	None of us have monetization here.
636500	639500	Uh, I think one of my assassins came back for success.
639500	641500	We're from a mission.
660500	662500	It's gonna be da Mona Lisa.
662500	664500	And that smile.
664500	666500	Overdone.
674500	676500	I'm so sorry, AC, I never managed to catch any of the-
676500	678500	Snowberries!
678500	680500	Any snowberries?
680500	682500	Hi, Snowberries!
686500	688500	He's a part of the campaign.
688500	690500	Get raided, get raided, get raided!
690500	692500	Get plopped, get plopped, get plopped.
692500	694500	Are you squidding me right now?
694500	696500	Ah, thank you for the 20.
696500	698500	Bajinga, what the fuck?
698500	700500	There's no way that says Bajinga.
700500	702500	Did I read that right? I read it in the top corner.
704500	706500	Thank you Bajinga for the-
706500	708500	What? You didn't even leave a message!
708500	710500	Why are you called Bajinga?
710500	712500	Oh, now I can't read chat.
712500	714500	Oh god, I'm so brain dead.
714500	716500	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
716500	718500	Bajinga?
718500	720500	Bajinga?
720500	722500	Good morning.
728500	730500	I'm glad you like icicles.
730500	732500	Ah, it's the woman.
732500	734500	Did you see the guitar AC design?
734500	736500	No, I didn't manage to catch her stream.
738500	740500	I was uploading everyone's Patreon audios.
746500	748500	Did you know?
756500	758500	Honestly, me is real.
760500	762500	I'm good to go.
762500	764500	She designed one for everyone.
764500	766500	Oh, I need to watch that VOD then.
768500	770500	No, no, there's not new audios on Patreon.
770500	772500	Sorry, I scheduled up everyone's Patreon audios.
772500	774500	I'm really struggling to know how to tag though.
776500	778500	If you didn't know.
780500	782500	Of men?
782500	784500	You worship their misery?
784500	786500	No, mate.
786500	788500	I actually prefer
788500	790500	holes and no poles.
790500	792500	Then he's swinging that way, but
792500	794500	I actually need nothing against a mate.
800500	802500	Wait, is this DLC?
802500	804500	Yeah, I think so.
804500	806500	My main quest stuff, this is side stuff.
806500	808500	Okay, ready to kill.
812500	814500	No reactive model today?
814500	816500	I never put it on.
816500	818500	I've got this though.
818500	820500	That's if I make a joke, I can do that.
822500	824500	Oh, oh, oh, oh, combat.
824500	826500	Hold on, hold on, get the wee knife out.
826500	828500	And let them attack you.
828500	830500	Oh, I can call them assassins.
830500	832500	So if I make a pun that I like,
832500	834500	I can literally do that.
836500	838500	Okay, the assassins on the horse, I'm happy.
844500	846500	Can you get off the horses?
846500	848500	Oh, that was brutal.
848500	850500	You can attack me then.
852500	854500	Whoa, I missed that.
854500	856500	Okay, there we go.
856500	858500	Please, God, do that.
858500	860500	It's hilarious.
860500	862500	Yeah, so if I come up with a really good pun,
862500	864500	all you're going to hear is that all day long.
868500	870500	Right away.
874500	876500	Casually kills a dozen people.
876500	878500	Zoom, my man.
880500	882500	Apologize.
882500	884500	Any apologizers?
884500	886500	Me, man, let me burp.
886500	888500	No, sorry, let me raid the horse.
888500	890500	Geez, I didn't mean to say that.
890500	892500	Literally what I was about to do.
892500	894500	Why is he running?
894500	896500	Why you won't?
896500	898500	I drink honey tea.
898500	900500	I have a lovely honey tea.
900500	902500	Just for me.
902500	904500	Some honey tea.
904500	906500	And a game
906500	908500	full of nostalgia.
910500	912500	And I'll play
912500	914500	and ramble all day.
916500	918500	So I can
918500	920500	enjoy
920500	922500	the game with you.
922500	924500	I'm not even, I don't know
924500	926500	what the tone of the song is after that come with me.
926500	928500	Yeah, there you go.
928500	930500	Wait, so what are you?
930500	932500	I am a cuttlefish.
932500	934500	I'm a siren
934500	936500	and a cuttlefish.
936500	938500	But the problem with being a siren is
938500	940500	I can't sing.
940500	942500	I can't lie on my hypnotic abilities
942500	944500	to steal the hearts
944500	946500	of men
946500	948500	and then perish them in the war.
948500	950500	I did not make
950500	952500	my lore, by the way.
952500	954500	But in terms of who's the most
954500	956500	evil
956500	958500	out of all of us in Vealor,
958500	960500	I'm pretty evil.
960500	962500	Then it goes Emi, but Emi isn't inherently evil.
962500	964500	She just really wants her brother back
964500	966500	and she does stuff to entertain herself.
966500	968500	Okay?
970500	972500	I drink some tea, so if I
972500	974500	start hypnotizing it's because I'm drinking tea.
976500	978500	I would, oh you'd perish
978500	980500	in my water, willing?
984500	986500	Follow me!
994500	996500	We are following
996500	998500	the leader
998500	1000500	the leader
1000500	1002500	trailing behind the leader
1002500	1004500	going ahead of the leader
1004500	1006500	the leader
1006500	1008500	the leader
1008500	1010500	oops
1010500	1012500	oops I don't think I'm supposed to be at this section
1012500	1014500	because they could spot me a mile away
1014500	1016500	but hey ho
1016500	1018500	somehow things work out in the end.
1018500	1020500	It speaks volumes about Vealor
1020500	1022500	but the most evil person is not the goat goddess
1022500	1024500	but the fish.
1024500	1026500	No! Azura created you
1026500	1028500	she's your literal mother
1028500	1030500	she created humanity
1030500	1032500	as we know it.
1032500	1034500	Like
1034500	1036500	so Azura is like the kindest
1036500	1038500	Mercy's just
1038500	1040500	misdirected, okay?
1040500	1042500	Mercy's just
1042500	1044500	misdirected, okay?
1044500	1046500	Mercy's just
1046500	1048500	misdirected, okay?
1048500	1050500	She just doesn't understand
1050500	1052500	because she does genuinely
1052500	1054500	love
1054500	1056500	but sometimes that love
1056500	1058500	results in
1058500	1060500	your expiration date
1060500	1062500	which is a shame
1062500	1064500	but she doesn't mean it, okay?
1064500	1066500	She's wholesome
1066500	1068500	She's like a dark yandere
1068500	1070500	She lures your guard
1070500	1072500	and then before you know it
1072500	1074500	the finishing act

1478500	1480500	I don't
1480500	1482500	want to speak
1482500	1484500	because I don't know for a fact

1626500	1628500	once again bro literally
1628500	1630500	oh no
1630500	1632500	this was your wee brother
1632500	1634500	it was actually so freaking sad
1634500	1636500	in Assassin's Creed 2
1636500	1638500	so your mother
1638500	1640500	Maria
1640500	1642500	she doesn't talk until you collect
1642500	1644500	100 feathers
1644500	1646500	because Pietro
1646500	1648500	the wee little brother
1648500	1650500	was collecting feathers and once you collect
1650500	1652500	all 100 feathers she finally speaks her first words
1652500	1654500	after the death of everyone
1654500	1656500	and it's just like
1656500	1658500	a freaking sad thing genuinely
1658500	1660500	and then this is your dad
1662500	1664500	oh it was so sad
1664500	1666500	literally so freaking sad
1666500	1668500	yeah the feather quest
1668500	1670500	that's why there's 10 feathers
1670500	1672500	in this game
1672500	1674500	I guess it's in memoria
1678500	1680500	oh
1698500	1700500	me
1706500	1708500	actually so sad
1710500	1712500	she doesn't
1712500	1714500	ah
1714500	1716500	she doesn't come with those
1716500	1718500	in
1718500	1720500	Christina's Etsy was like
1720500	1722500	true love
1722500	1724500	and then so sad
1724500	1726500	she's feeding corpses to the fishes
1726500	1728500	oh that's true
1730500	1732500	and there was no in-game map for the feathers
1732500	1734500	do you want to hear the worst part
1734500	1736500	about the feather quest in Assassin's Creed 2
1738500	1740500	so my
1740500	1742500	Xbox was in a different room
1742500	1744500	from where the computer was in my house
1744500	1746500	so I would have to
1746500	1748500	scurry to the living room
1748500	1750500	and memorise a location of a feather
1750500	1752500	and then scurry back through to
1752500	1754500	my Xbox as a child
1754500	1756500	my mum was like
1756500	1758500	what on earth are you doing
1758500	1760500	I'm getting worried about you
1760500	1762500	and I was like the feathers
1762500	1764500	mum the feathers I need the feathers
1764500	1766500	what do you need the feathers for
1766500	1768500	I was like scurry and back and forth
1768500	1770500	like
1770500	1772500	all of that
1772500	1774500	and I did it once
1774500	1776500	I've never done it again
1776500	1778500	but we'll probably try and do it when we play AC 2
1778500	1780500	these are DLC
1784500	1786500	I
1790500	1792500	allegedly like so the way I memorised
1792500	1794500	things I don't have a very good like brain
1794500	1796500	so I had to
1796500	1798500	open my eyes really wait and
1798500	1800500	oh it's the crit sale
1814500	1816500	wow
1828500	1830500	wow
1830500	1832500	so after chaseries
1832500	1834500	date with bait
1834500	1836500	the crit sale got married off
1838500	1840500	and Chanel is on the countryside and hiding
1844500	1846500	but yeah I used to like have to
1846500	1848500	in order to memorise stuff
1848500	1850500	I had to open my eyes really
1850500	1852500	which I know seems bizarre
1852500	1854500	but it's the only way I could do it
1854500	1856500	I just had to go like oh
1856500	1858500	and then like I wouldn't blink and then I'd run
1858500	1860500	to the Xbox and like where the location was
1860500	1862500	it sounds really dumb now that I'm saying it out loud
1862500	1864500	but it was the only way I could do it
1864500	1866500	like the like phones weren't
1866500	1868500	like well I didn't have a phone
1868500	1870500	it was
1870500	1872500	because I was a child and like
1872500	1874500	yeah phones weren't like that
1874500	1876500	um
1876500	1878500	wee
1882500	1884500	this is
1884500	1886500	really dangerous because I actually don't know which way
1886500	1888500	okay okay that was lucky
1888500	1890500	eyes wide must take all information
1890500	1892500	I was literally like sorry can't speak
1892500	1894500	don't talk to me
1894500	1896500	and then I'd get another feather
1896500	1898500	and then come back through and look at the next one
1898500	1900500	and if
1900500	1902500	you like pick up feathers on the way
1902500	1904500	it actually makes it a bit harder
1904500	1906500	where is that heck am I supposed to go
1906500	1908500	there are guards everywhere
1908500	1910500	Lecretia is
1910500	1912500	is that just a straight jump I think so
1912500	1914500	okay
1916500	1918500	you don't hear a grown man
1918500	1920500	fall into here literally
1920500	1922500	oh my back
1922500	1924500	yeah
1928500	1930500	yeah you don't remember
1930500	1932500	which feathers you pick up along the way
1932500	1934500	so it makes it even harder
1934500	1936500	because if you go to the area you think
1936500	1938500	it was that
1938500	1940500	um
1940500	1942500	sorry I got nervous I'm about to go the wrong way
1952500	1954500	I can reach that
1954500	1956500	jeez
1956500	1958500	Skyrim logic
1958500	1960500	best logic
1960500	1962500	sorry is there
1962500	1964500	I think
1964500	1966500	no there can't be flags on the DLC
1966500	1968500	that's not allowed
1968500	1970500	wow that camera angle change
1970500	1972500	sheee
1972500	1974500	wee
1974500	1976500	although I will say one thing
1976500	1978500	about this DLC this is so satisfying
1978500	1980500	because um you really won't get caught
1980500	1982500	by the guards doing this
1982500	1984500	you can literally parkour your way through it
1984500	1986500	and the guards don't actually catch you
1986500	1988500	which I see is very
1988500	1990500	satisfying gameplay wise
1990500	1992500	but it's satisfying yes
1992500	1994500	um
1994500	1996500	I do like the idea of like it's
1996500	1998500	he'll be able to like completely sneak undetected
1998500	2000500	without the fear of being detectives
2000500	2002500	wee
2002500	2004500	oh my god
2004500	2006500	ugh I have terrible news
2006500	2008500	aren't you pee already um
2008500	2010500	yeah like see I love this
2010500	2012500	this is like so satisfying
2012500	2014500	like I'm just quietly
2014500	2016500	sneaking around
2016500	2018500	ooh
2018500	2020500	we're in the gardens of
2020500	2022500	whatever that goddess name is
2022500	2024500	and I've already forgotten
2024500	2026500	what the garden's called
2028500	2030500	okay this is the bit where you can
2030500	2032500	lose
2032500	2034500	I think
2034500	2036500	right you can't climb the hedge
2036500	2038500	I guess
2038500	2040500	okay
2044500	2046500	as if they don't hear me
2046500	2048500	fucking

2070500	2072500	a borrowed
2072500	2074500	title bestowed by my husband
2074500	2076500	ill-fitting and barely concealing
2076500	2078500	the truth
2078500	2080500	you can keep your life

3030500	3032500	these countries these groups
3032500	3034500	make such easy targets for the lazy
3034500	3036500	and ignorant

3054500	3056500	human hands aided by a fierce intelligence

3102500	3104500	working on
3104500	3106500	there was a pole there that you could have grabbed
3106500	3108500	to save the health of your ankles
3110500	3112500	I am not going to take responsibility
3112500	3114500	for you being sore
3114500	3116500	that was point blank
3116500	3118500	that was point blank
3118500	3120500	no excuse
3122500	3124500	I am trying to escape
3124500	3126500	this district
3126500	3128500	it puts you all the way into
3128500	3130500	a certain section of the map
3130500	3132500	by the way go all the way out of the section
3136500	3138500	shake all about
3138500	3140500	you do the hokie pokey and you run around
3140500	3142500	and that is what it is all about
3142500	3144500	hey
3144500	3146500	that is green
3146500	3148500	let's start watching
3148500	3150500	I am suing viewer
3150500	3152500	your pentas
3152500	3154500	have you drawn your pentas a little too much
3156500	3158500	the funniest thing
3158500	3160500	I got a few maros
3160500	3162500	I wouldn't say anyone was like disgruntled
3162500	3164500	I think they were surprised
3164500	3166500	so out of all the four audios
3166500	3168500	for sheebie
3168500	3170500	three of them are her in control
3170500	3172500	and one of them is her not in the controlling position
3172500	3174500	guess which one you all voted
3174500	3176500	well the majority voted for
3176500	3178500	the one where she was
3178500	3180500	and then I got a few messages
3180500	3182500	and I am like ah please
3182500	3184500	I kind of maybe need to explain it a bit better
3184500	3186500	we are working on
3186500	3188500	making graphics so you know
3188500	3190500	what content is coming up
3190500	3192500	it just takes time
3194500	3196500	we are settling into everything
3198500	3200500	obviously emi got a warning recently
3200500	3202500	in sheebie's
3202500	3204500	lower video got 18 plus
3204500	3206500	so I think we are actually debating
3206500	3208500	about deleting it to try and
3208500	3210500	ensure she gets monetization
3210500	3212500	I would be mortified for the girls
3212500	3214500	if they didn't get
3214500	3216500	like they were rejected from youtube
3216500	3218500	monetization because of me
3218500	3220500	because member the girls didn't pick their designs
3222500	3224500	and I would feel like so upset
3224500	3226500	like don't get me wrong
3226500	3228500	there's still stream elements, there's still patreon
3228500	3230500	there's still tips on stream in general
3230500	3232500	which is perfectly fine
3232500	3234500	heck am I supposed to go
3234500	3236500	but I would be mortified
3236500	3238500	for the entire month for monetization
3238500	3240500	streams all because I didn't think
3240500	3242500	I had to get a toggle to cover up
3242500	3244500	the cleavage
3244500	3246500	hmm
3264500	3266500	what do you normally need to do to get monetized
3266500	3268500	500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours
3268500	3270500	but your channel
3270500	3272500	can still be rejected
3272500	3274500	which is understandable
3274500	3276500	they need to go through the content
3276500	3278500	but I'm hoping
3278500	3280500	all things considered
3280500	3282500	if the girls are sitting doing game streams
3282500	3284500	and all of that it's just another
3284500	3286500	they're just gamers pass it on
3286500	3288500	obviously before we could launch
3288500	3290500	I could only spell out so much
3290500	3292500	don't be silly
3292500	3294500	of course
3294500	3296500	the girls aren't going to be
3296500	3298500	am I not to be detected
3298500	3300500	don't detect me I'm scared
3302500	3304500	get in here
3306500	3308500	who dares approach the veil of hey
3308500	3310500	right we're just going to go for it
3310500	3312500	cause there's no need to
3312500	3314500	assume we can just run
3314500	3316500	right those guys are bugged out
3316500	3318500	cause that guy
3318500	3320500	literally couldn't give a left boot crack
3320500	3322500	ooh I'm going to hurt my ankles
3322500	3324500	thank goodness we have the armor
3324500	3326500	cause yeah
3326500	3328500	I'm just going to run
3328500	3330500	for the objective there's no point
3330500	3332500	to stopping and fight cause it's one of those ones
3332500	3334500	where they just keep
3334500	3336500	spawning in with more guys
3336500	3338500	and it's just a waste of time
3340500	3342500	we're trying at 100% this
3342500	3344500	I say that as if we don't have to
3344500	3346500	redo all of this again probably
3346500	3348500	to get 100%
3348500	3350500	I actually don't know what
3350500	3352500	oh no 100% was don't be detected or something
3352500	3354500	that is impossible if they're going to just
3354500	3356500	constantly spam enemies
3356500	3358500	may I sit on the bench please
3360500	3362500	oh

3960500	3962500	the further into the game we get
3964500	3966500	because it's starting to get pretty
3966500	3968500	like the ones where it was like

5068500	5070500	am I just to leave the castle in general?
5070500	5072500	I have no idea
5072500	5074500	if we're looking north of the castle

5190500	5192500	and you can see the colosseum in the background too
5194500	5196500	honestly this map is humongous
5196500	5198500	do you remember that?
5198500	5200500	okay
5200500	5202500	right let's try
5202500	5204500	this again
5204500	5206500	I don't really want to be on the site of
5206500	5208500	the castle but
5208500	5210500	it's where it's taking me
5210500	5212500	so

5250500	5252500	I have not woken up clearly
5252500	5254500	I think I might need to get a call
5254500	5256500	or something like I don't feel like I'm here right now
5256500	5258500	this is the most pathetic
5258500	5260500	wait
5260500	5262500	it made me go out of bounds only to tell me the map
5262500	5264500	is right
5272500	5274500	why would anyone
5274500	5276500	stop I don't need the lore and the paintings

5288500	5290500	oh
5290500	5292500	oh it's because of the bridge
5296500	5298500	you're really good at this game
5298500	5300500	maybe yesterday
5300500	5302500	yes but today
5302500	5304500	rough very rough gameplay
5306500	5308500	I still don't think a man can jump 100 feet
5308500	5310500	maybe I'll be fine honestly
5310500	5312500	game please I don't care about your stinky pay
5312500	5314500	I literally I do like that they genuinely
5314500	5316500	put like all that lore and I'm sure like others
5316500	5318500	appreciate it but I'm so sorry I'm very
5318500	5320500	like them
5320500	5322500	I can't be in there's only
5322500	5324500	so much knowledge I can inhale
5324500	5326500	not PewDiePie not the bridge
5334500	5336500	that's terrible
5336500	5338500	yesterday's Nike Daily
5338500	5340500	before we set which is 4pm
5340500	5342500	and that's kind of annoying
5342500	5344500	is Nike Gacha
5352500	5354500	I just know it's got pretty girls
5354500	5356500	and people like the pretty girls
5358500	5360500	use your head more than your brain
5360500	5362500	I'm literally like
5362500	5364500	use your head however we're gonna solve
5364500	5366500	this problem to open the door
5366500	5368500	yes you're right use my head
5368500	5370500	I'll ram it against the door until it breaks down
5370500	5372500	that's how I am
5374500	5376500	we are gonna hire because we are gonna try and get the
5376500	5378500	favor of everyone at some point
5378500	5380500	so we're I'm gonna take that money
5380500	5382500	at the bank because your bank interest can
5382500	5384500	actually get full
5384500	5386500	and then you're kinda wasting
5386500	5388500	that income
5388500	5390500	free money
5390500	5392500	actually the hay bale
5392500	5394500	this should be as high as the jumping point
5394500	5396500	to be safe to enter
5398500	5400500	I don't wanna use my head
5400500	5402500	okay last one
5402500	5404500	of the Leonardo mission

5422500	5424500	did you know strongy

5428500	5430500	in that hay bale
5432500	5434500	as if he knows it's going good
5434500	5436500	we're finding Leonardo

5951220	5953220	And I'll make it hurt
5954460	5958900	Normally I am merciful that Leonardo is a dear friend of ours
5959940	5966220	And you hurt him that is foolish. I'll make sure your death is as long as painful

6030060	6038220	Kicking him or would you rather I used my knife on the contrary there is nothing I would like more than an amiable solution
6038780	6046380	Help Leonardo see reason with the Patigarian Unifier. We will remake humanity together not under my
6048300	6050700	Then the revolution will begin without you

6118140	6120140	No, no, don't let them talk just
6121500	6123500	Me of knowledge
6123500	6125940	One must choose to search for truth
6127060	6129380	Forcing it on others accomplishes
6130020	6132020	These lost people

6210740	6212740	The Pythagoreans
6214340	6218300	Like a beam of light ignites fire which symbolizes knowledge
6221100	6227340	Wow, I'm gonna say something controversial this reminds me of the blades

6283340	6285940	She be warning in 13 minutes to my
6288420	6290980	The blades you mean the organization we all kill

6334980	6340220	Little bit to the left wait if I just go down back. Oh, no, no, I'm supposed to go here
6341220	6344180	It's pretty clever, honestly
6345740	6349060	I'm like you guys are named after Lord of the Rings. Let me be happy
6350820	6352820	Why the half
6354780	6358060	Why the refling I do not know
6360020	6364740	Maybe it is because they give me courage we must continue onward
6365700	6370660	Hmm, I suppose Salah is out having fun spending my ardent Florence
6371180	6376420	He is safe at home. I'm relieved about the Florence, of course
6376940	6378940	You do not need to lie to me
6379540	6383380	Salah if you give the blessing I am
6384580	6386660	Leonardo da Vinci and a loss for words
6387340	6389340	That is a burst
6390420	6392420	Also M for
6392420	6395860	Masked this room could use a little
6400460	6402460	Leonardo a kudibaturi
6404540	6406820	He is soupy now the sound of wind
6410980	6412980	You hear that sound of wind
6415660	6417580	Wow
6417580	6422300	Okay, I said these DLCs maybe weren't worth that. I don't know what their base price was but
6422660	6424660	Wow
6430300	6433500	Leonardo just casually talking to us while we're literally doing like the
6437780	6440780	Just jump on the face. Oh, yeah. Yeah, dude
6444100	6446100	Here rabbit aim
6449100	6451380	Whoa, that's really smart, okay
6453060	6455060	Must have been the wind
6457060	6460060	Now I can get back up here. Oh
6464060	6467740	I didn't even I was like where the heck am I this camera angle is wild
6473660	6478100	Oh, hey, so we're getting a bit dangerous out here. I'm not gonna lie. I'm gonna be nervous. I'm gonna be shamed
6478100	6480100	A
6480460	6484980	Little bit windy up here. Yes, I'm a tummy's rumbling. I forgot to eat
6489860	6491860	I
6498700	6500700	Maybe we finish
6508260	6515900	My father, uh, maybe we get cooler and I'll get my snackie wackies again, and then that will refuel me
6517860	6519860	Why
6526340	6533220	Oh, there's a bar right there, I'm very struggled with the DLC. I can't believe it. Where's where's the yellow paint?
6533220	6535220	I
6536700	6543100	What snack time snack time is the exact same as yesterday I am going to have I have one egg
6543620	6548700	Today because I forgot to boil more eggs before stream. So I have one egg left over
6548700	6555420	I will have two meat sticks and I will have pea snacks as well with a cola and water
6556420	6560580	Um, I don't think I'll make another tea. I'm not really feeling like a tea right now
6561460	6567380	I had one before I did my very quick ASMR recording session. I had one when I started to stream. So tea maybe not right now
6568420	6574020	Wow, I hope this is the right way. I've just launched myself down there without actually checking
6575260	6580820	So anyway, when was the last time you had vegetables? I actually do struggle to eat vegetables. The problem with
6581820	6583820	streaming long is
6584140	6585860	I need snacks
6585860	6590740	But on short stream days like I can make myself an actual meal. So don't worry about me
6590740	6595380	I know I had takeaway yesterday. I have my chicken burger on my chipies. I
6597140	6599140	Had
6600420	6604780	Breakfast English tea, I believe it's called. Oh, she be eight minutes
6605780	6608500	Haram, Haram hair and
6610580	6612580	She be eight minutes
6616740	6618740	Uh
6619140	6622980	But yet for long day for long streams, it's much
6624100	6629300	I am really struggling. You can tell I've hardly played the DLCs. My goodness
6629300	6633220	Oh, it blasts into the campaign, but then the DLCs makes them possible
6636500	6643140	Me clings and worrying is like people breathing honestly. Whoa. Oh, that's cool
6646260	6648900	Wait a minute, didn't this not happen with the blades as well?
6650820	6653620	That's good help. Oh, we know Skyrim came out in 2011
6654900	6658020	Yes, how enlightening very funny
6661620	6664580	Jump oh jump cross. Sorry
6665620	6670260	Confused and it's like, uh, what do you want me to do me? This is literally a wall and I'm like a jump on it
6676660	6678660	Wow
6678980	6680980	Wow
6680980	6684660	On a scale of zero to one how good of a cucumber? Um
6686660	6694020	For the foods that I like hundreds for the foods that you guys might like, uh, not so good
6698020	6704100	Hey, oh, I thought I was having to jump on the fire there. I was like this is gonna be good
6706180	6708180	Oh
6710980	6715540	These sound effects are so different from regular assassin's feet as well
6716980	6720740	I am enchanted the music is different as well for the DLCs
6723700	6725700	I'm very much enjoying them
6727940	6729940	How good am I King Ting, uh
6731620	6733620	I have an air fryer

6857220	6859220	I like smiling like an idiot
6861940	6863940	Wait
6866660	6868660	I
6879780	6881780	Is this the room
6888980	6890980	Those are not Pythagorean symbols
6892180	6894180	43 39
6894740	6896740	19 n
6897220	6899220	75 27 42
6900660	6902660	W

6910980	6912980	You are leaving it's not for
6917300	6919300	It's for Desmond
6919460	6924660	I must be in the chair that I go. It's the the vault and assassins creed three locations
6927140	6929140	What are you not telling me?
6931060	6937060	Well, I have begun several dissection studies. Oh my god. It's for dance man
6940260	6942900	Oh my god, I literally have tears in my eyes. That's so cool
6943460	6945460	Salah you would model for it again, of course
6945700	6949940	Then perhaps I will study a woman with gentle and see how her body changes
6950740	6952100	Interesting
6952100	6953700	Tell me more
6953700	6955700	No fucking AC
6956260	6959700	When his body's all mangled, it's where they take him
6960580	6965300	You can sedate Desmond now. Yes. Oh my god. It all makes sense
6969220	6971780	Yes, and then you're broken in revelations
6972900	6974900	Oh
6974980	6978100	Oh my god, I get it. I understand
6980020	6982020	Ah
6983700	6989060	That's right. Oh my god, it's like all clicking like a like, uh, uh
6991540	6997700	Oh my god, that's so cool and revelations Desmond's broken. You're stuck in the animus
6998660	7001860	And they can't take you out because you're so mangled
7003860	7011700	And it's you understand that he's a vessel for Desmond to get information in present day. It's absolutely crazy
7014500	7016500	Oh, that's so cool
7018580	7020580	That's so cool
7020980	7024420	Oh spoilers. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just like I'm like re
7025380	7029300	Like putting it all back in my head because I've played brotherhood over and over and over
7029540	7032580	But I didn't always have access to the dlc's whenever I played them
7034180	7038980	And then it's all clicking in Assassin's Creed revelations. You're mangled in the animus
7041140	7049140	And we had to go like in present day your dad William takes like Desmond's dad William takes him to the thingy
7051220	7055780	To that location because it's a safe haven and it's where one of the gods
7056340	7059620	Uh, like the building things were and
7060340	7063540	Ah, it's just so cool. It's so cool
7065700	7067700	Oh
7071300	7073300	Desmond's stuck in the mangled in the animus
7075300	7081540	I have no idea who Desmond is but i'm happy you're happy. So we're playing xio Desmond is his and
7082500	7084500	I
7084740	7090820	Like blood lineage offspring and we use Desmond's dna in present day to look back at xio in the past
7093060	7096660	Christina oh, we just jump scared our oops
7111860	7113860	Of nothing
7119620	7124020	My father kept asking me to choose I thought I would never see you again
7127220	7130660	It's manfredo he's going to kill him what?
7132020	7136820	In tally he lost money. He's dragged them out to the end of the new bridge. Who the hell is manfredo?
7138260	7140260	No
7141700	7146580	Save christina's fiance manfredo from the freaking gamblers
7148260	7152420	I'll have a freaking minute. No. I'm just gonna let him perish so I can take christina away with me

7208980	7210580	Never the same
7210580	7212580	You will be a good husband to her
7214020	7218020	Oh, why is this game so sad? What the heck?
7222740	7224740	I can't handle this
7228740	7230740	All right, she's a wee bit of a slag, but it's fine
7231220	7236340	Wait, it feels really not going like I know like he never ended up with her because of revelations
7236420	7240100	But why is this game so sad? Why can't it feel have a freaking happy ending?
7241140	7243140	He tries so hard
7243700	7245700	He's fine. He'll make a good husband
7246660	7248660	I made sure oh
7249940	7251940	What
7252740	7254740	Even christina's confused
7255460	7259940	It's you you're supposed to take her away. You're supposed to whisk her away
7261540	7262980	Oh
7262980	7268180	You're crying. I've got tears in my eyes. I'm just like can it's you have one like happy ending
7268820	7271940	So I like I I'm really invested in it's your storyline
7273940	7278500	I don't get it give this man catch a freaking break. Is that the end of christina's story?
7280500	7282500	I don't see a broken heart on the map
7285540	7290420	There is no way it ends there for chris christina
7292260	7294260	I don't see a broken heart on the map
7301780	7303780	That's it
7307300	7309300	That's freaking it
7310260	7312260	Oh
7313140	7315860	You can't do this to me you be soft. Come on
7317460	7321780	Oh for folks that we're gonna have to do the plane. I don't want war machines now
7322580	7326100	No happy ending for the best character literally like
7327060	7329060	There must have been more written
7329140	7335220	I'm so sorry, but I do not believe for a moment the development team ended it there for christina
7336180	7340820	Literally it's you saving him from gamble and going do you love her?
7340900	7345700	Do you love her and then that's it? I do not believe one second the writers left it there
7346340	7352900	If there isn't more it must have been cut because I refuse. I refuse. I refuse
7365460	7370100	But it's you will have a hell of a happy ending. I can't remember what happens at the end of revolutions
7371780	7376980	I really did not play it as much like I know he was sweet on a girl and then she got kidnapped
7378900	7384020	But that's not the true love christina was
7386660	7388660	Like
7388740	7390740	Ah
7391300	7398020	They saved it for the 20 bucks DLC honestly, isn't that song misery was I have no idea
7399780	7401780	I just if it remain
7401780	7408100	Never my intention to brag it was never my intention to mine. Oh, I can probably renovate this aqueduct while I'm at it
7408100	7410100	I'm like right next to it
7413780	7416100	I mean, I don't know I simply saw it it took revelation
7416500	7417700	I
7417700	7422740	Took revelation. Look to this one. He if you want the christeners, you just get somebody's I feel sinking
7424020	7426500	There's more wait. What's her DNA sink?
7427380	7429380	Uh 100
7430980	7433220	Oh, that's very low in the batter on the va
7434420	7436340	right
7436340	7438340	Oh total sink
7438740	7440500	Oh
7440500	7445860	Okay, okay. I get you come on. I get you come on right. We're gonna do Leonardo. I think that brings up her total sink
7446660	7448660	surely
7449220	7454740	No, it doesn't it didn't we were like unfortunate right hold on hold on we're steamrolling this right in memory
7455700	7458660	We only have one thing we failed. Do not drop below his
7461540	7463540	Huh
7463940	7467060	Is this this one where they jumped me out of nowhere from around the corner
7467860	7476340	Okay, okay, let's try again. Oh, we're going to shoot him for that deja vu. Okay. We need 75 percent sick
7476500	7479540	We need more. I just felt like that was such a bizarre thing to end on
7486180	7488180	I think it's when the guys jumped me
7489140	7491140	I
7494100	7496100	I can't skip this
7499060	7501060	Didn't know you could do all this in a sense people
7503540	7508020	Uh she be is alive by the way for anyone who you would like to watch her
7509460	7511460	Modes you have permission to speak
7513060	7515060	momentarily
7516020	7519620	Oh the music. Oh, okay, let's just play it all over again. Why not?
7534260	7536260	So good
7537140	7539140	Oh
7542580	7545060	Left of it since the borja came to power
7547460	7549460	He cannot see it from here
7553300	7557380	Well, I had to google why the Christina mission wouldn't show up in my game. So you're welcome. Oh, literally
7559060	7562100	First and only girl in the series. I still doesn't realize literally
7563300	7565300	Okay
7565700	7570180	So someone said I didn't take the medicine like a dum-dum dummy dum-dum-dum
7572740	7574740	Jeez. Oh wow because I'm
7580180	7587380	Okay, I know I'm replaying it. I didn't know it did it like this. I like fully armored up fully healed up
7590820	7593220	Uh, okay, I'll take it. I'll take it
7595620	7597620	Oh
7599220	7607220	Okay, let's do this the totality. Hello, mr. Doctor may I please have oh my arm
7611300	7613300	I need to find a doctor you're 100 health mate
7614420	7618580	It's just faking it. Literally. He just needs a bit. Honestly felt that I needed a bit attention
7619620	7621620	I felt that
7625700	7628420	But they have not proven effective against such things
7629060	7636100	However, I can recommend several good colleagues around the city. Do you need anything else? No, sir. Thank you very much for your help
7639140	7642500	Right checkpoint reach of north
7646020	7648020	I think it was the guards
7648580	7649780	a
7649780	7651780	The guards hit me
7652180	7656180	Remember when the guard hit me around that corner? I think this entire section is for that
7658420	7663620	I don't have climbing gloves. Okay, so I don't have what abilities I don't have at that time
7666660	7668980	Chad doctor not prescribing leeches, honestly
7672420	7674420	Right
7677540	7679540	Um
7680340	7682340	Oh, what's my opinion on satan food? Hey
7683540	7685540	It was a game. Yeah
7686820	7690820	Okay, it must have been because they hit me around the corner when I wasn't expecting that
7692340	7694820	Literally arrow storm would wait this
7697380	7699380	Yeah, it was definitely because they hit me
7703380	7707380	We'll try and finish Christina or maybe we should do Leonardo
7709540	7712580	It would be nice to finish Christina, but then we're having like backtrack all this way
7714100	7718980	Right, what weapons? Okay. I do have my fast knife. So hopefully none of them like
7719540	7722500	fly out of the corner and attacked me because that was
7723460	7727460	What happened the first time like they started attacking me way before we even got to the
7728180	7729300	Gallo
7729300	7733700	Which is where it's supposed to start. So I'll definitely hold back a bit more
7734420	7736420	to be cautious
7736820	7742340	Like I didn't dislike Assassin's Creed 3. Well
7744980	7750900	I wouldn't play it on stream though. Like I definitely wouldn't be like as excited and happy and all of that
7751620	7753300	and I
7753300	7757060	Really love how forgiving the counter controls are in brotherhood
7757860	7760340	In revelations, I think it's roughly the same
7760900	7763940	Um, but in Assassin's Creed 3 onwards
7764020	7768660	They like change the controls and I am definitely if it's not broke
7768900	7773300	Don't fix it. And if you fixed it, it has now made like gameplay
7773940	7780020	Frustrating like I really strongly dislike when gameplay gets interrupted because of like
7780660	7786340	Oopsie. Whoopsie. You forgot to dodge this attack. So now you're desynced and you have to repeat this over and over and over again
7786820	7793220	Uh, because we've changed the controls and we knew for a fact that the controls on brotherhood were received so well
7793300	7799460	Because it's like our best well received game, you know, like that stuff just makes me perish
7801460	7807380	Right, we're still gonna stay back. We're not quite at the gallows yet, but I don't want anyone reaching
7809700	7814500	To attack me and I definitely have time to react if I've kind of got this distance on them
7814500	7816500	Ah
7821700	7823700	Sorry, excuse me. Pardon me come through
7825460	7832180	All right, take your time. Actually I have smoke bombs. I'm wondering if that's probably the safest method maybe smoke bombing them
7833140	7835140	If they turn on me
7837620	7841380	Are we at the gallows yet? I'm like getting scared. I do not want to replay this
7841460	7846180	If it's literally gonna be like this strike from okay here is where they kicked off
7850100	7852100	I don't know if I should claim, you know that
7853460	7857540	Whoa, that's okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
7859860	7862660	I have access to all my long range. I am using it
7865860	7869940	Please citizen do not walk in front of the crossbow bolt my goodness
7872340	7874340	Oh, wow, this is did I just
7879220	7884020	Citizens, please do not walk in front of the crossbow ball. Okay. There we go done 100%
7885060	7886100	Yeah
7886100	7890740	Okay, this is so much easier. I did not realize we'd have access to the older weapons for this stuff as well
7891540	7893540	This will make it easy
7894180	7896660	That guy had a death wish literally like thank you for
7897620	7902980	It's you did not kill civilians. Well because civilians certainly pop themselves off right. That's fine
7905220	7907220	Uh double
7907460	7909620	Oh, we've got one missing from this one as well
7910420	7912580	Do not be detected while reducing to a right
7913860	7917140	That's like super easy. Why have I failed these ones?
7918180	7920180	Fake game are clearly
7923380	7925380	Uh, right
7927300	7930900	Oh, I need to do the whole thing over again. Oh, it's okay
7931460	7935220	I'm surprised to see you 10 out of 10 reeflings recommend strong for this reason
7937700	7941460	Was this the game that had the terror defense? No, that was revelations
7944740	7947620	She was super excited and borrowing them to a barrel
7948500	7954580	That man is a traitor to our order your character design romance of mesmer from subnautica
7955380	7958980	Is there mpc's in subnautica? I thought it was like you versus all that
7962420	7964420	I know
7972500	7978980	You run into guards. Well, oh, that's right. That's true. That's true. Really. Really. Yes. It's true
7980980	7982980	The mesmer is a fish
7983300	7985300	I'm a fish too. I'm a photo fish
7986580	7991780	Oh, I didn't sink my my cheeky iPhone. Hold on. Let me calibrate myself right now
7996820	8000820	Okay, I calibrated so now you can like really tell what I'm looking at you
8002260	8005060	Okay, we will rock you for one
8007620	8011220	It's a scary little fish that hypnotizes you stop is actually okay
8011220	8015060	Maybe we will have to play subnautica didn't realize I was in the game
8019700	8022180	There are mpc messages, okay
8023220	8025220	that's cool
8025620	8028340	Right how much ammo? Oh, I need a restock ammo
8028980	8030980	Okay, I'm actually going to do the
8032500	8036260	Pouch upgrades so we can like hold a lot of stuff because the pouches increase
8036820	8040180	your ability to hold ammo like a lot more and
8040980	8045940	It'll definitely help out in these kind of rewind situations
8053860	8055860	Wait, you've never played subnautica?
8056900	8062020	I don't remember. I think I've seen people play it. Which is why I say like I don't remember playing it
8062740	8064180	um
8064180	8065780	I'm in
8066260	8070340	My tummy's wumbling. Okay. Okay. Okay after this one we go get food and fizzy juice
8079060	8081060	Wow that would hurt
8084500	8090580	We can play it together and stream as long as you guys hold my hands through subnautica because I have no concept for what to do
8090580	8093300	My son Claudio has been injured they are going to shoot him
8094500	8098340	Not if I shoot first get the others because I'm a I'm a quick shot
8103780	8108820	I may not have an automatic, but I'll I'll do it anyway. Oh, whoa. Whoa. What are you doing?
8110180	8112180	Yeah, yeah
8112340	8114340	Whoa, they're like destroying him
8115060	8117060	Oh
8117380	8123700	Why are you just accepting gunshots? Oh, okay. We did it. We did it quick. I'd run the guards. Can we hold hands anyway?
8124180	8128100	Yeah, I subnautica multiplayer. Imagine if you guys can come in and help me
8129460	8131460	Oh, we should have more games like that
8131860	8135460	Uh, right. Don't get caught while reducing notoriety. I'd like to see you son
8137620	8143860	Oh, my tummy's really yumbling. Whoa. That was a good switcheroo words. My stomach is really rumbling
8145300	8147300	Okay
8147700	8152100	As soon as I notice it all of a sudden it's a big problem, but I don't notice it for like hours on end
8152980	8157700	Are you sure you guys aren't the one hypnotizing me because I'm starting to feel like it is going that way
8158180	8161620	It's single player. Oh, that sucks. It would be so fun to play
8167540	8169540	There is a mod but
8170260	8171860	I don't know if I need like

9089380	9092740	From my mother's side of the family. Oh, well, do you want to know?
9093460	9095460	What's funny?

9120180	9122180	Don't know where they went literally
9123220	9125220	You know it all went to my butt instead
9126340	9128340	so
9129300	9131300	I don't know how
9132740	9135780	You got your yiddies from your father, honestly
9138020	9140020	When can we get mum on stream?
9140020	9143620	Stop she'll actually talk about it. She'll be like, I
9143940	9145940	Just never grew anything
9146580	9147860	um
9147860	9150420	Like I remember when she got me a training bra
9151620	9155700	Like so if you didn't know a training bra is like to get you used to wearing
9156340	9161380	One because it's actually really uncomfortable. Like I know I know it doesn't sound like it's uncomfortable
9161860	9163860	But like having something to strap down
9164820	9166580	moving parts
9166580	9168580	um, it's kind of cut
9168980	9170980	I
9171220	9175140	How much am I missing? Is that like less than 500 Florence roughly?
9176020	9176980	Oh
9176980	9180740	Um, and like she got me one and I was like mum. What is this for?
9181380	9183380	And she was like, oh well
9183780	9188340	I've got big gibbers. So you're gonna get big gibbers as well. And I'm like, um, okay
9188420	9190580	So like I start training and then nothing happened
9190580	9192580	Oh
9200580	9207460	No, not like a sports bra like just like a thin fabric to like get you used to it and then yeah, none hand
9209060	9211060	None hand with me
9215380	9217380	But I'm not mad like I quite like my
9218100	9219860	Uh aesthetic
9219860	9226500	Some people like have struggles with their bodies, but I am really lucky because I I prefer being
9227460	9233300	Uh, not having much up but having a lot down like I really like my body
9237220	9239300	Yeah, like small buddies don't get in the way either
9241220	9246660	Like all I hear like my mum will complain about like back pain and I'm like
9247620	9250180	The only pain I get is like
9251620	9253860	I don't get any pain because of my physique
9255140	9259460	I would say that sorry. I'm trying to like think and do things at the same time and it's not working out. Um
9260580	9262580	I would say like
9262980	9268340	My physique just means like I'm always good to go basically
9269860	9272260	Uh, right when we do another dna
9273220	9277940	Do you know bro, but do you know? Okay, there's quite a lot. Um, oh

9287220	9290500	No, I don't want to do you either right. I'm gonna avoid any don't be
9292980	9294980	I can do it in this one. I know how to do that one
9294980	9296980	I
9299780	9302260	So I just went on a massive ramble about that
9303860	9308500	Milk milk and dump truck as I go. Oh mini milk is uh, yeah mini milk
9309860	9311860	Oh, no, we don't have our assassin recruits
9312820	9315780	But we should at this point
9316740	9318740	Hmm
9319140	9321140	It's going to be a bit painful
9322100	9326340	At the meeting find them on the computer wait, where are you gonna get some food? Oh, I was
9327860	9330340	Okay, we'll do it after this one. See you guys distracted me

9339540	9342420	Wait, I have one assassin recruit thing
9344100	9346340	Is that because I only had one at the tank?
9347300	9348900	Oh
9348900	9351460	Oh, no, it's because they're all away on missions right now
9352260	9356580	Okay, so if my assassins are way on missions, they're not available during recall that's
9357860	9361860	Yeah, I understand that's probably like programming would have been a nightmare
9362580	9366340	So, yeah, no, that makes sense. Okay. I won't send my recruits away too much anymore
9366900	9372740	If that is the result I can send away the lower level ones because they do not count for the assassin signal
9372820	9375540	I'm just gonna do this right now. I'm pretty sure it'll count
9377220	9379220	towards my hiring the
9380420	9382420	to lure the guards
9392900	9397860	At the end of every week each one of us I'm starting to get lightheaded oopsies should have got some food
9406420	9408420	Yeah, you put everyone else on quest literally
9409620	9414180	I need to go around and find all these gestures. I don't know what happens at the end of the gesture
9414420	9417220	Thing like they're getting money or just something happened
9418900	9420900	Wait, is that senator?
9421540	9426260	I'm wondering should I stall right now so all my recruits come back for this mission
9427860	9432660	Right. Yes, we're going to do that. That's probably the best idea right now. So I don't mess up this mission
9432660	9436340	I'm actually going to go out of range just so the event doesn't trigger
9436980	9438980	and
9439220	9442260	Please get off. There we go. We're just hiding here. Why not?
9443620	9446500	I'm going to go get some food. I'm going to get a drink as well
9446900	9449620	Oh, did you see that street performer fall over there? Oh dear
9450420	9455300	I'm going to go for pee and please do get up and hydrate and stretch your legs
9456100	9459300	Because we do not have hemorrhoids in the reefing gang
9460260	9464260	Hey, I'll be back very shortly. Literally. I just need to like put it all in a bowl and then
9465060	9467060	Uh, that's it really
9467620	9469620	I don't recall if I need to do anything else
9470260	9472580	Maybe make a hot water bottle because I'm a bit chilly
9473300	9476420	Bit chilly. Right. I'll be I'll be like couple of minutes
9489300	9492740	I would hide there
9495860	9497860	He could be in here
9504340	9506340	Hey, you'll need a beating
9519300	9522020	Oh
9579300	9609300	I think it's a good idea to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
9609300	9615440	bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of of a little neutralization.
9699300	9701300	Come on and play.
9789300	9791300	You want to take a picture?
9819300	9847300	Were we not in a haybill when I left?
9847300	9849300	Am I going crazy? Did I not put myself in?
9849300	9851300	Let's see if I can just go play on his own there.
9851300	9853300	And break the fourth wall.
9857300	9859300	My god, the shuby stream is hilarious.
9859300	9861300	Hell yeah, it's how you go watch her.
9861300	9865300	I could have sworn I was in that haybill, but whatever.
9865300	9867300	You were, a guard shoved me out.
9867300	9869300	I got bullied.
9869300	9871300	Yes, all your florns.
9871300	9873300	How dare you.
9873300	9875300	A guard attacked me. How am I alive?
9875300	9877300	Did the mission just reset?
9877300	9879300	Right.
9879300	9883300	I can see that I've got three sassan signals.
9883300	9887300	So this is going to make things a heck of a lot easier.
9887300	9893300	I completely forgot I bought chocolate covered raisins.
9893300	9895300	And I have chocolate covered raisins.
9895300	9897300	And I'm sorry, I had.
9897300	9899300	No more arguing.
9899300	9901300	Your bill has come to you.
9901300	9903300	They just pushed me out, I guess.
9903300	9905300	No, the banker sent us to play.
9905300	9907300	Make an exception for her own mind.
9907300	9909300	Momentarily.
9909300	9911300	Not good enough.
9911300	9913300	Right.
9915300	9919300	Oh, am I allowed to be detected at this stage?
9919300	9923300	Do not be detected while escorting the senator.
9923300	9925300	So I'm not escorting just yet.
9925300	9927300	I know I said that wrong, so I repeated it.
9927300	9929300	It seemed like I said on purpose, but the truth is I didn't.
9933300	9937300	I like how the senator couldn't, like, perfectly see through it.
9937300	9939300	By the way, sorry, I just know it's a mean tag in the reply.
9939300	9941300	Under your schedule is Cephala Fogo.
9941300	9943300	Is that correct?
9943300	9945300	Have I spelled it wrong?
9945300	9949300	I probably spelled it wrong then.
9949300	9953300	This is what you guys need to tell me what to do.
9953300	9955300	Because I don't know what the heck I'm doing.
9955300	9957300	Friends these days.
9957300	9959300	Unfortunately, I am not one of them.
9959300	9961300	Cephala Fogo.
9961300	9963300	Cephala Fogo.
9963300	9965300	He fights the guards and gives away money.
9965300	9967300	Where have you been all my life?
9967300	9969300	We better get out of here.
9969300	9971300	Cephala, please.
9971300	9973300	So, honey, someone on Twitter made a VTuber food tier list
9973300	9975300	and they put you in impressive.
9975300	9977300	Oh yeah, they like my fringe tipped.
9977300	9979300	You're going to have to protect me though.
9979300	9981300	Hold on, I'm taking a sipping to Nicola.
9981300	9983300	Did you guys get up and start to leave?
9985300	9987300	I'm so sorry.
9987300	9989300	I don't know what's going on with my tum tum.
9989300	9991300	I'm having to take more painkillers,
9991300	9993300	but I'm having them with food,
9993300	9995300	so it's not going to hurt me.
9995300	9997300	I promise it's not going to hurt.
9997300	9999300	Not long.
10003300	10005300	Cephala Fogo, honestly.
10005300	10007300	I mean,
10007300	10009300	I take a little nibble out.
10013300	10015300	Oh, burp warning.
10015300	10017300	I burp a lot when I eat.
10017300	10019300	So, please brace yourself.
10019300	10021300	If you're not...
10021300	10023300	Not that you're not into burping,
10023300	10025300	but I understand that some people have been raised
10025300	10027300	that burping is very rude,
10027300	10029300	but I...
10031300	10033300	Oh, I liked her scream.
10037300	10039300	Okay, if you look away,
10039300	10041300	your assassin recruits will despawn faster.
10041300	10043300	And then they'll
10043300	10045300	start reloading quicker.
10047300	10049300	Did you see the art of food?
10049300	10051300	Art.
10051300	10053300	I've been locked out of my Twitter.
10055300	10057300	I keep getting locked out of it
10057300	10059300	to the point where it's inaccessible,
10059300	10061300	and it keeps telling me to do these
10061300	10063300	like, stupid capture thing.
10063300	10065300	And it keeps saying
10065300	10067300	um...
10069300	10071300	No?
10071300	10073300	Well, I did not
10073300	10075300	see them at all.
10075300	10077300	Um...
10077300	10079300	So, it says like,
10079300	10081300	verification complete, you're human.
10081300	10083300	And then it says,
10083300	10085300	error submitting.
10085300	10087300	I can't do anything.
10087300	10089300	I don't know what I want to do.
10089300	10091300	Um...
10091300	10093300	So, I've been locked out of my
10093300	10095300	alt one.
10095300	10097300	I've not had a chance to check out
10097300	10099300	my current one.
10099300	10101300	That is the music so loud in my ears.
10101300	10103300	Sorry, I need to turn my headset down.
10103300	10105300	I'm gonna have to get this stage.
10111300	10113300	There we go.
10113300	10115300	They're gang violence and I'm right now.
10115300	10117300	Barpeous, more wind.
10117300	10119300	Um, am I allowed to confess
10119300	10121300	I've already recorded it?
10121300	10123300	I sat in my recording booth
10123300	10125300	for 15 minutes.
10125300	10127300	I had one bottle of water
10127300	10129300	and one can of cola, and I felt ill
10129300	10131300	after recording it.
10131300	10133300	But, I already recorded it.
10133300	10135300	I'm so sorry.
10135300	10137300	If it's not your thing.
10137300	10139300	But, it's the truth.
10139300	10141300	I already recorded it.
10143300	10145300	I thought it was funny.
10145300	10147300	But, I don't really have manners.
10147300	10149300	I was raised in a barium.
10151300	10153300	I've just gone...
10153300	10155300	Oh, management
10155300	10157300	unlocked my alternative twitter.
10157300	10159300	Okay, I'll go. I'll look after stream.
10159300	10161300	And then I'll see what I've missed
10161300	10163300	because I think it's very possible
10163300	10165300	I've missed a lot of fanarts or clips.
10165300	10167300	Someone clipped me.
10167300	10169300	Plain Assassin's Creed.
10169300	10171300	Someone clipped me
10173300	10175300	when me and the horse
10175300	10177300	were beating up the captain.
10177300	10179300	I was like giggling my little
10179300	10181300	bottle off at the cliff. It was so good.
10181300	10183300	I'm gonna tweet it out
10183300	10185300	because like it was just so funny.
10185300	10187300	I really appreciate anyone that clips me
10187300	10189300	because clipping takes so much time.
10189300	10191300	How long will the audio be?
10191300	10193300	I think it's roughly 15 minutes
10193300	10195300	after editing because
10195300	10197300	I'm doing a lot of
10197300	10199300	what I call live ASMR
10199300	10201300	where I don't edit out all my mistakes
10201300	10203300	and stuff.
10203300	10205300	I know this sounds a bit funny
10205300	10207300	saying it like that.
10207300	10209300	But...
10209300	10211300	But...
10215300	10217300	Sorry.
10217300	10219300	What was the name?
10219300	10221300	I'm sorry.
10221300	10223300	My brain's too small to think and talk and play at the same time.
10223300	10225300	Oh, yeah.
10225300	10227300	Live ASMR.
10227300	10229300	I've really been enjoying doing it.
10229300	10231300	Instead of the super hyper edited approach
10231300	10233300	if I make a bump
10233300	10235300	then I just lower the volume
10235300	10237300	so it's still acceptable for ASMR
10237300	10239300	at one point my cat
10239300	10241300	came in
10241300	10243300	my recording booth
10243300	10245300	and I was like, do you want to do ASMR with me?
10245300	10247300	And my baby boy was like
10247300	10249300	so I'm just like gonna leave it in
10249300	10251300	because it's just so precious
10251300	10253300	and I really like it.
10255300	10257300	I've really
10257300	10259300	enjoyed doing live ASMR
10259300	10261300	instead of like try hard even more.
10263300	10265300	I've done like
10265300	10267300	scripted ones as well
10267300	10269300	where I'm rambling out my butt
10269300	10271300	like so much.
10273300	10275300	If it's not scripted
10275300	10277300	my rambling ASMR is ridiculous.
10277300	10279300	Like it's not even ASMR honestly.
10279300	10281300	It's just me goofing off talking about whatever I like.
10281300	10283300	Um, whoa, whoa, whoa.
10285300	10287300	I've accidentally hired
10287300	10289300	this group
10289300	10291300	when I'm...
10291300	10293300	How is the senator under attack?
10293300	10295300	I don't even know how he's under attack.
10295300	10297300	There's no one that patrols that way.
10297300	10299300	As long as I don't get discovered
10299300	10301300	I could be
10301300	10303300	here. What happened?
10303300	10305300	We're addicted to the yapping.
10305300	10307300	Where can I hear the ASMR? It'll just be on YouTube.
10307300	10309300	I do need to edit it. I've got a few things first before
10309300	10311300	I start doing my
10311300	10313300	1000 subscriber
10313300	10315300	thank you ASMRs.
10315300	10317300	Like I've got a few collabs that I need to focus on first.
10317300	10319300	Like I really, whoa, whoa, whoa.
10319300	10321300	Why did all of that...
10321300	10323300	Did I not
10323300	10325300	perish you guys?
10327300	10329300	Can you look at those
10329300	10331300	guards maybe?
10333300	10335300	Okay, there we go.
10335300	10337300	They're gonna fight each other.
10337300	10339300	Wait, what?
10339300	10341300	Yeah, so this is true.
10341300	10343300	Taser ASMR unlocked by she-
10343300	10345300	What? Is she doing ASMR right now?
10347300	10349300	But yeah, my rambling ASMR
10349300	10351300	always end up, like non-script
10351300	10353300	always end up in a massive ramble. That's not even ASMR.
10353300	10355300	There's so many things in it
10355300	10357300	because at one point during one of them
10357300	10359300	I was like, do you want to listen to how much
10359300	10361300	ASMR tools are on the floor right now?
10361300	10363300	And like I kick my feet around the mic
10363300	10365300	and stuff so you can hear it.
10365300	10367300	It's just a scene.
10367300	10369300	Am I silly Billy, honey?
10371300	10373300	Wait, whatever.
10373300	10375300	100%
10375300	10377300	We get Taser in
10377300	10379300	the actual Taser.
10381300	10383300	She's trying to make an ASMR game.
10387300	10389300	What did you want again?
10389300	10391300	Like I did an ear cleaning thing.
10391300	10393300	Like an ear cleaning role-play.
10393300	10395300	And like the first sentence I said
10395300	10397300	was like, oh, the STD clinic's down to the left, mate.
10397300	10399300	I was like, oh, you're here for your ear cleaning.
10399300	10401300	I'm gonna start cleaning your ears.
10401300	10403300	Like I'm just...
10403300	10405300	I don't know why, I'm just like having such a good time.
10405300	10407300	She said drunk ASMR.
10407300	10409300	Oh, she's drinking, I hope she's careful.
10415300	10417300	Okay, I'm gonna eat my egg and meat
10417300	10419300	because
10419300	10421300	I don't like
10421300	10423300	when
10423300	10425300	eggs are out of the fridge.
10425300	10427300	I don't want to get sick.
10427300	10429300	So, eggy and meat stick.
10431300	10433300	Oh, she's steaming.
10433300	10435300	Oh, is she steaming?
10437300	10439300	Oh my god, did you hear the egg just bite me back?
10439300	10441300	It's just full of the money.
10443300	10445300	I can do that one easy.
10445300	10447300	Easy.
10447300	10449300	But I can 100% this one.
10449300	10451300	I just bugged it.
10451300	10453300	Bugged it.
10461300	10463300	It's so good.
10463300	10465300	It's so easy to make as well.
10465300	10467300	It's literally boiled egg.
10467300	10469300	I look forward to this drunk ASMR.
10469300	10471300	Shibi's doing it right now.
10471300	10473300	YouTube moderators, you have permission to link.
10473300	10475300	Please consider supporting Shibi Cottonbomb.
10475300	10477300	She's doing live drunk ASMR.
10481300	10483300	Shibi, how's it going?
10483300	10485300	We're trying to finish Christina's frickin' story line.
10489300	10491300	There we go.
10491300	10493300	Bancum on the way home.
10503300	10505300	I'm a bit worried.
10505300	10507300	I don't have a napkin again
10507300	10509300	and I've just touched egg.
10509300	10511300	I'll just wipe it on my hoodie.
10511300	10513300	Sorry, I'm gross but it's true.
10515300	10517300	Look at Emmy's alt.
10517300	10519300	Bancum.
10521300	10523300	Can I see it?
10523300	10525300	Can I see it?
10525300	10527300	See it?
10527300	10529300	I think I'm following it on the memes.
10539300	10541300	Where is it?
10545300	10547300	Is it hidden?
10547300	10549300	And you can't see it
10549300	10551300	unless you search up for it?
10559300	10561300	Where the heck are you?
10561300	10563300	Oh, there it is.
10563300	10565300	I got it. What did she post?
10565300	10567300	Oh, her tummy hurt.
10567300	10569300	Is that what you mean?
10569300	10571300	Do you have a favorite streamer snack?
10571300	10573300	No.
10573300	10575300	Let's eat anything.
10575300	10577300	Oh, why did I feel like I've heard it before, Strony?
10577300	10579300	I'm Strony Cuddles now
10579300	10581300	and I'd like to remain Strony Cuddles.
10581300	10583300	Thank you very much.
10585300	10587300	Underneath the tummy hurt message.
10587300	10589300	Me when I can't kiss you 600 times a day.
10595300	10597300	The retweet or her tweet?
10597300	10599300	Tight.
10601300	10603300	You up and whispering in your ear
10603300	10605300	that if you can make it to 30 seconds
10605300	10607300	without I'll reward you.
10607300	10609300	As fast as you can.
10609300	10611300	I'm watching you struggle not to.
10611300	10613300	But in the end, you'll still fail.
10617300	10619300	Please give me a kiss with what?
10621300	10623300	Oh, I never read the full thing.
10623300	10625300	I just read that her tummy hurt.
10625300	10627300	Oh, my God.
10627300	10629300	Emmy.
10629300	10631300	That's outrageous.
10631300	10633300	That's so good.
10633300	10635300	Emmy.
10635300	10637300	That's funny as in.
10645300	10647300	You'll never guess what.
10647300	10649300	H.E. Girlfriend in my DMs.
10649300	10651300	I was right.
10651300	10653300	There's my clubs happening by hook or by crook.
10657300	10659300	I'm so bad with Twitter.
10659300	10661300	I'm supposed to tweet like when I'm going live and stuff.
10663300	10665300	But I just can't even ball it.
10665300	10667300	I just can't even ball it with Twitter.
10667300	10669300	It's for looking at pictures and then doing your thing
10669300	10671300	and then going off again, you know what I'm saying?
10673300	10675300	I only got to the tummy part.
10675300	10677300	No, I didn't read ahead.
10677300	10679300	I just saw that she had a sore tum tum.
10681300	10683300	Maybe like,
10683300	10685300	all the girls run their own social media.
10685300	10687300	I told them do what you want.
10687300	10689300	Because like, I'm so bad.
10691300	10693300	I know you're supposed to tweet like oh, I'm going live.
10693300	10695300	I'm doing this in an hour.
10695300	10697300	And I'm like, I feel like those who want to be here
10697300	10699300	already know the drill.
10703300	10705300	But I do get that reminders are helpful.
10705300	10707300	And say I'm going to use it for like, oh,
10707300	10709300	my YouTube video for 1000 subscribers
10709300	10711300	is here. Take thing.
10713300	10715300	I don't miss the strong 10.
10715300	10717300	That's so good.
10717300	10719300	Self gatekeeping.
10729300	10731300	Are we going to react to the Xbox showcase stuff?
10733300	10735300	What's my stream on Sunday?
10735300	10737300	I don't know.
10739300	10741300	I can't, I think
10741300	10743300	my stream on Sunday is
10745300	10747300	the sweets.
10749300	10751300	Hmm.
10753300	10755300	Johnny is cute.
10755300	10757300	Cute. You're cute.
10757300	10759300	Reflink cute.
10761300	10763300	Okay.
10763300	10765300	I shouldn't munch too much, but I'm so hungry.
10769300	10771300	Okay.
10771300	10773300	Born sweet.
10773300	10775300	Okay.
10775300	10777300	Hmm.
10777300	10779300	I kind of plan to do like one endurance
10779300	10781300	game stream a week.
10781300	10783300	So next week is Skyrim for endurance.
10783300	10785300	Then we have Elden Ring
10785300	10787300	for two weeks in a row
10787300	10789300	after that.
10789300	10791300	So I'm playing the DLC
10791300	10793300	with you guys first.
10793300	10795300	And then I'm playing multiplayer
10795300	10797300	with sin sister.
10797300	10799300	Um.
10801300	10803300	And we also have shot callers
10803300	10805300	and heart rate winners and all that jazz.
10805300	10807300	Um.
10807300	10809300	Thankfully sin sister is an
10809300	10811300	endurance streamer. So like if you ever
10811300	10813300	get annoyed like, uh
10813300	10815300	I hate it like when
10815300	10817300	streamers like don't finish a game.
10817300	10819300	I don't like it either.
10819300	10821300	Which is why I would love to get
10821300	10823300	endurance streamers for Borderlands 2.
10823300	10825300	I would love to do a VTuber
10825300	10827300	playthrough like you know the VTubers.
10827300	10829300	The problem is
10829300	10831300	if people aren't endurance streamers
10831300	10833300	that's like
10833300	10835300	so long.
10835300	10837300	Whereas if you can find endurance
10837300	10839300	it takes maybe three streams max.
10839300	10841300	If you want to just blast through the campaign
10841300	10843300	maybe even two honestly.
10843300	10845300	Uh-huh.
10845300	10847300	Bye.
10855300	10857300	What?
10857300	10859300	I'm sucking my fingers.
10859300	10861300	I don't know why my tongue's coming out.
10861300	10863300	Oh it thinks my fingers are my tongue.
10863300	10865300	Uh-huh.
10865300	10867300	That's so cool.
10867300	10869300	I love this.
10869300	10871300	I don't know if I've ever been
10871300	10873300	Borderlands 2 is like a hoot in a hole or
10873300	10875300	it's like a fun game honestly.
10881300	10883300	Oh maybe I should look at Marshmallow
10883300	10885300	while I do this.
10885300	10887300	Yes I will look at Marshmallow.
10887300	10889300	That's so silly.
10893300	10895300	Oh my goodness.
10895300	10897300	I have a hundred more questions
10897300	10899300	than I did yesterday.
10899300	10901300	Oops.
10901300	10903300	Any chance there will be a full body
10903300	10905300	pillow for sale in the future?
10905300	10907300	Yes!
10907300	10909300	Uh-huh market
10909300	10911300	are like absolutely amazing to work with
10911300	10913300	or like whenever a girl has a birthday
10913300	10915300	please tell us and we're happy
10915300	10917300	to do like a new thing for you.
10917300	10919300	Um so the more support
10919300	10921300	like they get on UwU market right now
10921300	10923300	the more favour we have
10923300	10925300	to like produce something new.
10925300	10927300	So for the girls' birthdays I would love
10927300	10929300	to do um
10929300	10931300	at least booba mouth
10931300	10933300	mouth mat
10933300	10935300	and
10935300	10937300	also possibly their mascots
10937300	10939300	in a plushie.
10939300	10941300	I don't know if the designs for the mascots
10941300	10943300	might be a bit advanced
10943300	10945300	um or they would come out
10945300	10947300	quite expensive that's the only
10947300	10949300	um issue.
10949300	10951300	Hi!
10951300	10953300	Good to hear you. Yeah it's good to be heard
10953300	10955300	isn't it? Um
10955300	10957300	100% open to any merch.
10957300	10959300	We are going to establish ourselves first
10959300	10961300	and then I'm going to reach out
10961300	10963300	to a very unique merch and dice
10963300	10965300	line because I have no idea
10965300	10967300	how to bridge a connection between that
10967300	10969300	for sure. You know you can only
10969300	10971300	do but ask. If you do not ask
10971300	10973300	you do not receive so I will ask
10973300	10975300	I will see if it's possible. If it's not possible
10975300	10977300	then we tried.
10977300	10979300	Um
10979300	10981300	would it be um
10981300	10983300	I'm not going to let you know what those type
10983300	10985300	of mousepad designs would be for the others.
10985300	10987300	I know what mine is
10987300	10989300	my big badonkadonk.
10989300	10991300	I take a bite of my muffin
10991300	10993300	and
10993300	10995300	mmm
10995300	10997300	I'm just, hi strongy I really like the
10997300	10999300	Assassin's Creed streams. I wanted to give
10999300	11001300	you uh feedback that I've tipped in
11001300	11003300	the stream elements page around five times now
11003300	11005300	between the two streams
11005300	11007300	but it never came up!
11007300	11009300	Oh no!
11009300	11011300	Wait wait wait wait
11011300	11013300	why would it not come up?
11015300	11017300	Why would you get filtered?
11017300	11019300	I don't
11019300	11021300	I don't
11021300	11023300	It was broken before
11023300	11025300	it's fixed now but why
11025300	11027300	would it not show up?
11029300	11031300	I have bejinga narrow tiny
11031300	11033300	spiny and bejinga again
11033300	11035300	for today. It broke yesterday
11035300	11037300	please tell me
11037300	11039300	if your money didn't go through
11039300	11041300	or did go through.
11041300	11043300	The paper was broken because
11043300	11045300	you guys gave us so much money you broke the
11045300	11047300	cricket paper but it's unbroken
11047300	11049300	that's what's fun.
11049300	11051300	It is a legal requirement
11051300	11053300	of all reeflings to love strongy stuff.
11055300	11057300	I also was
11057300	11059300	thinking
11059300	11061300	I need to find an artist to do this
11061300	11063300	one that's good with all body types
11063300	11065300	I would love
11065300	11067300	for our six month anniversary
11067300	11069300	to have a mouse pad
11069300	11071300	of all of us together like one of
11071300	11073300	those big flat mouse pads
11073300	11075300	I would adore to have us
11075300	11077300	all together. I absolutely adore it
11081300	11083300	but I would need to get
11083300	11085300	a really good artist for that
11085300	11087300	I would not want to waste money
11087300	11089300	dicking around with an artist
11089300	11091300	I would want an artist to
11091300	11093300	smoke it
11095300	11097300	I would adore it
11099300	11101300	Since there's a notification discord server
11101300	11103300	would it be possible for you to
11103300	11105300	upload the unarchived stuff
11105300	11107300	to the discord like a thread
11107300	11109300	unarchived stuff?
11109300	11111300	Do you mean like karaoke stream or the ASMR stream
11111300	11113300	that went kapoot?
11113300	11115300	I think because
11115300	11117300	we shouldn't
11117300	11119300	really host it because I got taken off
11119300	11121300	so I don't want to be the ones
11121300	11123300	responsible
11123300	11125300	does that make sense?
11125300	11127300	Like archive annons shout out to archive annons
11127300	11129300	for saving everyone's butts
11129300	11131300	For me
11131300	11133300	I am open to suggestion if you don't like the suggestion
11133300	11135300	please you're more than welcome to give me your opinion
11135300	11137300	again on Marshmallow but archive annons
11137300	11139300	if they broke don't fix it
11139300	11141300	they've been doing fantastic
11141300	11143300	they've been catching
11143300	11145300	what's been put out there and
11145300	11147300	hmm
11147300	11149300	hmm
11157300	11159300	Are alternative streams
11159300	11161300	going to be free to access? Yes I do
11161300	11163300	not personally
11163300	11165300	believe in paying more than
11165300	11167300	like 10 us dollars
11167300	11169300	to like fully support your oshi
11169300	11171300	and get everything that they put out there
11171300	11173300	and the girls have shown an interest
11173300	11175300	in playing alternative games
11175300	11177300	and doing some other stuff
11177300	11179300	but I
11179300	11181300	would not
11181300	11183300	like them to charge for it
11183300	11185300	I'm going to say to them like let's not charge
11185300	11187300	but obviously I will never hold you back
11187300	11189300	from giving any tips to the girls
11191300	11193300	you can always tip as a thank you
11193300	11195300	to content that you enjoy
11195300	11197300	but that's with me
11197300	11199300	like someone said
11199300	11201300	hmm
11201300	11203300	do I plan on raising
11203300	11205300	the prices of what's been established
11205300	11207300	no I don't
11207300	11209300	I think
11209300	11211300	I think 10 us dollars per month for all the
11211300	11213300	content that the girls put out is fair
11213300	11215300	and I think it's
11215300	11217300	good value for money
11217300	11219300	and I think it also
11219300	11221300	shows that
11221300	11223300	like
11223300	11225300	the end goal isn't great and again
11225300	11227300	like 820 split comes into it type thing
11227300	11229300	and it goes up in their favour next year
11229300	11231300	type stuff if they want to hang about
11231300	11233300	like
11233300	11235300	I think if it's more than 10 us dollars
11235300	11237300	you're
11237300	11239300	not taking the piss
11239300	11241300	but
11241300	11243300	I very much push for
11243300	11245300	value for money and
11245300	11247300	I hope
11247300	11249300	I know region
11249300	11251300	doesn't always
11251300	11253300	change the price of membership
11253300	11255300	regionally
11255300	11257300	which is obviously a big thing that's hard
11257300	11259300	to overcome
11259300	11261300	because we don't set the price
11261300	11263300	but if the website doesn't do
11263300	11265300	an alternative payment style
11265300	11267300	then
11267300	11269300	you're getting shafted in other countries
11269300	11271300	there is a
11271300	11273300	streamer that talked about selling games
11273300	11275300	and it was like oh
11275300	11277300	Brazil because they lowered the price
11277300	11279300	in Brazil like it was fine
11279300	11281300	and all that jazz
11281300	11283300	I'm sorry I'm rambling I'm not making any sense
11283300	11285300	um
11285300	11287300	by the way
11287300	11289300	cuddles I sometimes make a lot of clips
11289300	11291300	as you probably remember from back
11291300	11293300	then
11293300	11295300	are you goober?
11295300	11297300	we may be goober
11297300	11299300	I'm happy for you to use my clips
11299300	11301300	with whatever
11301300	11303300	you want whenever but I would
11303300	11305300	prepare to keep the clips of you as
11305300	11307300	gay cats as possible
11307300	11309300	and I only share those with the reeflings really
11309300	11311300	and I post a group
11311300	11313300	clips of the other girls
11313300	11315300	I'm happy for the clips of the
11315300	11317300	other girls in the group clap to be used
11317300	11319300	to monetize the shoot oh that's so nice of you
11319300	11321300	whatever you want not like it really matters what my opinion is
11321300	11323300	yes it does you mean
11323300	11325300	you goober
11325300	11327300	and I would like to keep comfy streams
11327300	11329300	as long as possible while you go naturally
11329300	11331300	and share well I've got good
11331300	11333300	news for you
11333300	11335300	the nature of my
11335300	11337300	content gate creeps me automatically
11337300	11339300	do you want to hear why a little reefling
11339300	11341300	my goal of a ASMR
11341300	11343300	video every time
11343300	11345300	I get like 1000 subscribers
11345300	11347300	the reason why that naturally
11347300	11349300	gate keeps me is because
11349300	11351300	someone will come into the live stream
11351300	11353300	after consuming that content and they'll go
11353300	11355300	when ASMR, when ASMR stream
11355300	11357300	and then when they see me rambling
11357300	11359300	my head off about a 14 year old game
11359300	11361300	having the time of my life
11361300	11363300	they're gonna get bored aren't they
11363300	11365300	they're only here for ASMR
11365300	11367300	5 head
11367300	11369300	I'm playing chess
11369300	11371300	and for D
11371300	11373300	already
11373300	11375300	I already did it myself
11375300	11377000	they're weak they can't
11377300	11379300	handle the scrawny they want the
11381300	11383300	they want the stealthy ASMR whisper in ear
11383300	11385300	they can't handle the rambling
11385300	11387300	they can't handle the accent they cannot handle the
11387300	11389300	errrr
11389300	11391300	so by default I naturally
11391300	11393300	gate keep myself you're welcome
11393300	11395300	love you reeflings, always had you in mind
11395300	11405060	Only the strongest roofling can survive on this level.
11405060	11409660	First time doing this, listen to your audio through- oh wait I don't think I can read this
11409660	11410660	one out loud.
11410660	11411660	It's a video link!
11411660	11415660	Oh am I watching that after this game?
11415660	11418220	Hey I did a Scottish game show.
11418220	11421180	Show them the name of places in Scotland and ask how to pronounce it.
11421180	11423660	That's such a good segment, love that idea.
11423660	11428740	I'm stealing it now, my idea now.
11428740	11432740	They tune into a stream expecting like a soft whisper with an accent.
11432740	11436580	I just sound like a bagpipe.
11436580	11438820	I can't handle the Scottish ramble.
11438820	11441220	Also check to see if you're still subscribed to the other girls, some have been called.
11441220	11445780	Oh I saw that I was like really YouTube you're calling us after like literally a 12 hour
11445780	11446780	stream.
11446780	11447780	Go and calm down.
11447780	11449540	It really should start to calm down now that we're streaming.
11449540	11453220	There is no way you're telling me like it's gonna keep continuing because this is getting
11453260	11454260	outrageous now.
11454260	11456620	Like I'm not laughing, no one's hee-hawing.
11456620	11464060	Strony it's not fair, you give the burp-huffer so much good stuff but what about the burp-huffer?
11464060	11466340	Oh stop it!
11466340	11471220	Is it terrible I have a Donothon reward where I took out my boot?
11471220	11477340	There's a really funny ASMR outtake and I laugh and then it comes out more with my laugh
11477340	11478340	okay?
11478340	11482900	So I'm thinking about you, don't mean I'm necessarily- and I swear if anyone starts
11482900	11489180	complaining like oh my god it's literally just a 10 second audio clip of me laughing
11489180	11490700	and releasing air.
11490700	11493820	Like do you think I don't have a digestive tract?
11493820	11498820	Do you think that I'm- oh I'm such a gamer girl.
11498820	11499820	Ehehehe.
11499820	11505140	No I'm Scottish for one.
11505140	11512140	I take big Steven jobbies, no such thing as an idol meeting and my piss is neon.
11512140	11517180	Alright let's- no let's get it right, let's get it right, right off the bat I'm no having
11517180	11518180	none of this.
11518180	11519180	Eww you?
11519180	11520180	No.
11520180	11526780	I'm Strony, I'm Scottish and I was raised in a barn when they manners.
11526780	11536940	If a little 10 second audio clip of me laughing while I tout filters you, my guy.
11536940	11539580	Enjoy the oo-woo because that's what you're looking for, no me.
11539580	11541340	You're not looking for me.
11541340	11546180	And that's okay, if you're not looking for me I've got 3.3, I've got 5 adorable doors
11546180	11548180	waiting on you alright.
11548180	11549180	Hi.
11549180	11550180	Ahem.
11550180	11551180	Mmmmm.
11551180	11552180	Sup.
11552180	11553180	Oh I'm gonna choke.
11553180	11563500	Sup lass, I feel they need to say something after that Brotherhood part 1 stream.
11563500	11564500	What are you talking about?
11564500	11565500	Why?
11565500	11569420	You don't think you could be considered- or oh she why?
11569420	11572820	Because there are creators out there who are more experienced, who you think are better
11572820	11575260	so clearly would prepare them?
11575260	11579100	Have you not followed- have we not followed and supported you for a while heck?
11579100	11585660	I've been listening, laughing, relaxing, sagging and straight, jorkin' his pentus.
11585660	11587340	For many a time now.
11587340	11588340	Why do you think that is?
11588340	11592820	Could it mean we adored this silly Scottish gremlin who's not afraid to be herself and
11592820	11594900	treat her with love and respect?
11594900	11598620	No lass, kick that impostor's syndrome to the curb, we love you.
11598620	11608980	Oh you're her or she, case closed, doofus, oh thank you Evelyn, I love you Evelyn, oh.
11608980	11609980	Is that a bag of chips?
11609980	11615940	No, it's a bowl, like the pea snacks are really hard, I can like dink them on the bowls without
11615940	11616940	them cracking.
11616940	11617940	Crack.
11617940	11629140	Oh there was a marshmallow you wanted to talk about on the other stream but I forgot.
11629140	11633420	Oh my god right, hopefully I don't forget this time.
11633420	11641740	There's a really brave wreathling who messaged me, well he's not a wreathling but he's asked
11641740	11645380	for help's wreathlings okay.
11645380	11654300	I'm gonna paraphrase it because I can't quite remember exactly what it said okay but basically
11654300	11662700	this person is struggling to brush their teeth and I think it would be very nice if we brush
11662700	11667340	our teeth together after stream, like when stream's ending we'll brush our teeth together.
11667340	11673580	I know that sounds silly however it takes 21 days to form a habit and I think it would
11673580	11678660	be nice wreathlings if we could encourage and help people that might struggle with that.
11678660	11683380	So if you would like to brush your teeth with me at the end of stream I will give a roughly
11683380	11689380	30 minute warning so you don't have any sugary drinks or any food before because that's bad
11689380	11694780	for your enamel to brush and I think it can be a really nice thing wreathlings can do for
11694780	11695780	someone.
11695780	11702820	Even if together we help one person hopefully if we consistently do it for 21 days we have
11702820	11707140	helped that person who was very brave by the way that was a very brave message to come
11707140	11709260	out with.
11709260	11716020	I won't say too much about it but you know you were very straight forward and said that
11716020	11725380	you don't you know consider yourself a wreathling and that's okay and you know we can't promise
11725380	11731420	that we can help everyone but we would love to maybe show you a way that we can do something
11731420	11736580	nice together and it's a lot easier when you do something together with someone.
11736580	11740900	So yes thank you for being very brave and reaching out I would like to brush my teeth
11740900	11745420	with you when I end stream I don't know if you're out there or not but we can definitely
11745420	11756740	do that together yes I see no problem yes unfortunately I don't have the consistent time where we can
11756740	11760460	not brush your teeth it would just have to be roughly 30 minutes before my stream ends
11760460	11765500	sorry I'm pushing in my chair you're pushing my chair.
11765500	11773340	Hi strongy congrats on debut I was wondering um nope you're done any games coming out that
11773340	11779540	you're excited for multiplayer the binding of Isaac apparently someone went data mining
11779540	11785180	and saw that there was a new repentance after plus or something so there might be patches
11785180	11790780	to current items which would be very interesting forming new habits with my oh she sounds like
11790780	11797140	a tuition name honestly join oral improvement she's getting closer to I am the urge to crack
11797140	11802260	a british joke oh my teeth are mangled honestly my teeth are mangled I'm like they're healthy
11802260	11808460	but they're just all squint and it's like I like the look of oh my god there's apparently
11808460	11813740	a pandemic happening in America with veneers veneers are like these fake things you put
11813740	11817700	on top of your teeth that are shaved down and it makes them look perfect but I feel
11817700	11823540	like teeth have personality like I like my wee squinty-winty teeth um I just I've never
11823540	11829660	seen myself any other way so it's me oh yeah I do understand for people that do need braces
11829660	11834860	like there's probably something else going on but I like I was obsessed and I never got
11834860	11841340	braces um and yeah I just have naturally squint teeth like they didn't come out perfect and
11841340	11850860	that's fine that's just how it is um mommy I really need a hug debut has made me really
11850860	11856980	emotional oh a little reflame trust me I know this isn't about me but I'm talking to you
11856980	11861860	now you should be so proud of what you've accomplished I am the girls have done fantastic
11861860	11866700	and I'm having a good time with my weathlands you and the girls but I feel much more lonely
11866700	11872420	than I did before oh watching everyone interact with each other the girls respond into mario's
11872420	11877460	ma rose and such I don't even know why I suppose I'm just envious of the attention that everyone's
11877460	11883260	getting I feel so out of place I'm so sad I haven't even been able to listen to your
11883260	11889300	audios to sleep I'm sorry for being selfish I feel selfish at all are you are you maybe
11889300	11896220	one of the lurkers that are shy to say anything or have I managed to successfully accidentally
11896220	11902540	dodge all your messages and stream and I would be a bit upset too if you were talking away
11902540	11907420	and I accidentally never read out any of your messages so I do apologize if that happens
11907420	11914420	and well I'm sorry real little reflame I never want to make you feel lonely if you are a lurker
11914420	11919500	and you're a bit scared to talk that's okay whatever your comfort level is you're allowed
11919500	11926060	to be that you can always say you can always be at arm's length or you can always be attached
11926060	11935580	up my head you can sit on my head if you like and and it's okay but just I don't know hopefully
11935580	11940260	it doesn't make you feel lonely like we vibe and I get to show you my childhood game you
11940260	11945420	guys get to show me you get to suggest to me your childhood game I want to something strong
11945580	11952340	yeah lurkers are beloved yes I understand for lurkers sometimes it can be a bit nerve
11952340	11958380	racking as well to like be perceived with my eyeballs and like I I read out what you see
11958380	11966860	and stuff but um literally uh if you would like evidence from my autistic diagnosis please refer
11966860	11971340	to my first stream which was 12 hours long and the only reason I went off instead of 14 hours
11971340	11977420	of full gameplay is because of bod okay I'm usually playing something and lurking yeah like
11977420	11982300	it's perfectly okay to lurk and just do your thing not wrong with lurking absolutely not
11982940	11990540	um don't be shy reflame strongy isn't always reading my comments but yeah it's um a guberrino
11990540	11999020	so I do apologize I've ever made you feel left out um and hopefully it doesn't happen in the future
11999900	12001340	I can only apologize
12003180	12009020	uh sometimes hi strongy want you to know what I think it's very cute when you narrowed out about
12009020	12013900	sassus gree brother it well I'm getting rolled in the dlcs clearly I'm not built for the dlc
12018060	12024060	I have a little sip of cola a fizzy juice I lurk when I'm at work mm yeah a lot of people like
12024060	12030940	lurking and listening to strongy podcast wait if you don't see the screen when I'm streaming and
12030940	12038540	like I'm beating up bad guys and oh you hear us huh oh take this oh like are you like oh what's
12038540	12044460	going on or can you use context clues I like to have the stream one in the background but I do
12044460	12048860	like to interact I'm like yeah don't feel don't ever feel forced to interact I know some people shy
12048860	12056380	like that hi goddess just wondering if you could forward something to management I know
12056380	12061020	viola or not on holodex but you can still view the stream of the URL
12061900	12067340	but I think the girls have something set that prevents their streams from being viewed through
12067340	12077980	third-party sites well mine is fame I can't be right it's true screen off pretend and strongy
12078060	12080300	physically throwing the refill and then around for sport
12083500	12087500	to be honest you talk enough that there isn't dead air so I don't have to wonder about what's
12087500	12094460	going on yeah I can't believe it wait was there really no dead air in the last stream I must
12094460	12099980	have been quiet at some sections there's no way I had the video playing I just can't fully watch
12099980	12106780	the whole stream yes the streams are a bit too long for the average adult uh okay management's
12106780	12110860	gonna look into holodex I think that puts all their streams together we were thinking about
12110860	12115660	hosting a website that showed all our stream schedules but it cost like more money and it
12115660	12119820	was just kind of one of those things where look holodex does it for free we're just gonna let
12119820	12125500	holodex take over who goes there I died for yourself there is almost no dead air outside of breaks
12126860	12131660	I may wonder my throat is sore honestly after uh after I've been done with you
12132620	12139580	I've watched for about five hours and wasn't any dead air you talked the entire time I do I'm
12139580	12144860	very passionate about this game very very passionate uh sorry if I missed it but what are we
12145580	12148860	yes your reeflings I was very dumb and never showed you what you look like that's you
12151020	12158860	I've lost some gnar twerk of nature of us together and what's the old twitter check out
12158860	12164700	who I follow on stronycuddles on twitter I don't use twitter much you're much better given a
12164700	12170780	like and a subscribe to this youtube channel I am not much of a twitter person okay in a gush I
12170780	12177020	use twitter now pretty much to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey want to make a samar
12177020	12186940	hey sweetcakes want to make a samar basically that's what I do I think your longest dead air
12186940	12193260	was the sprint section where you were against the clock and you're still monologued more like
12193260	12199100	monomogged because I'm just that good at being a yap or ooo hey strony loving the assassin's
12199100	12205580	greed I was wondering if you have ever seen or played lost planet one or two I haven't there
12205580	12209580	are fun games that I think you may like even if you don't play them I still appreciate you for
12209580	12215980	beating this message I have not I've never heard of them or I can't remember them being on the cover
12216060	12225980	of an xbox 360 so probably not have I ever played dragon age I played the demo of dragon age
12227340	12234860	one I think uh where it's like brother and sister at the star and then one of them perishes if I
12234860	12241100	remember correctly yeah that's how much dragon age I've done I don't know what it's like um
12241340	12251020	but yeah yes one take flamboyant cuttlefishes are highly poisonous okay well I'm a flamboyant
12251020	12254700	because I'm a watermelon candy here someone described as watermelon candy and I'm like
12254700	12260380	honestly true true uh will there be streams on other platforms okay
12263500	12268060	congratulations on your debut I'm looking forward to supporting all the talents I must
12268060	12274060	apologize I said that's so wrong I must apologize but I find myself confused what you meant by
12274060	12279980	vealers collab restrictions and I'm looking forward to clarification you describe the
12279980	12287180	collab restrictions as the unwritten rule through other information do you mean for me
12287980	12294940	my collab restrictions are um I'm like if I don't know that someone is like me mentally
12294940	12298620	then I can't stream with them because I'm dumb I can stream with the girls though that's fine
12298620	12305820	and the girls can stream with whoever they like other than males they're not allowed to stream with
12305820	12315260	males or interact with males or follow males literally that's the only rule and so far so good
12316060	12321820	literally none of the girls have broken that rule strongy slaps of each of us behind I can make you
12321820	12330860	a star yeah um it seems odd for me for them to be rules I've never heard of any other agency that
12330860	12338780	has an outright rule against them against who sorry I'm not read this properly uh especially
12338780	12346460	value in freedom doesn't that apologize if it comes off with really critical however I think
12346460	12350140	clarification word on the issue oh and they can freaking go wherever they want
12352780	12362620	oh this is asking about male collabs the person has said wrestle tube collabs were like mixed
12362620	12370620	would the girls be able to do that I mean I would never stop them from an opportunity
12371740	12376940	like would they be on the same team as a guy like I don't think I don't think that's like
12376940	12383100	advised if it was like that like I wouldn't advise it however none of the girls have given me an
12383100	12390940	indication to ever even do that like I think we would be like sorry but uh we can't uh we are
12391900	12397980	following Japanese idol culture and uh no male sorry sorry we sexist out here
12399580	12403900	which is terrible don't say that I learned don't say that part I learned keep burping don't apologize
12407580	12413500	hello again friend of a friend I knew you well
12417100	12426220	no true it's just a rule that you can bet sitting my love on
12427100	12431260	I don't remember the words pick it up every time
12440060	12445100	hi strongy I think you've been one guy what does that mean saying names is okay as long as it's not
12445100	12453260	too much oh no so the way I I've been taught V tripper culture I'm so sorry but I've been taught
12453260	12460300	by the majority V tripper culture I'm not allowed to say your name unless you don't know
12460300	12470540	or membership however because and the reason why I can't do it when it's like just saying hi section
12470540	12477580	or in general is because like people think favoritism is forming or jealousy and I really
12477580	12485180	don't want anyone feeling put out um wait that's exactly what you've just said to me
12487340	12491900	we have just agreed okay we've just agreed yes we have agreed um at the start of the ASMR stream
12491900	12497660	I am going to try and say people's names just as a special thank you for showing up how do you feel
12497660	12502620	that you're no longer a v-tweeter well hopefully my first stream length really showed how much I
12502700	12511820	enjoy v-jobbing sup cuddles was thinking of a tag uh I've missed the tags I kind of finished them
12511820	12520940	oopsie uh please do give us a guide for those script writing yes um I'm currently getting a
12520940	12527740	new manager on board that deals with all the scripts and thank god he is a male because he
12527740	12532460	can actually write scripts that guys want to hear because I can only guess what you want to hear
12532460	12539520	and so much. So like roughly the first three months of scripts are me, and then it goes
12539520	12544500	to other script writers, and then it goes to the script manager, but we're a testing
12544500	12550440	script manager. But if all goes well, my responsibility is less than so much, and I can stream so
12550440	12558440	much more! Well at the start of the stream you were at 3.5k, now you're at 3.3. Heck
12558440	12565440	yeah, that means I don't have to edit the 4k thousand any time soon. That's fine. Hey,
12565440	12576440	I have to say that I think you are amazing. I don't get to interact with many Scottish
12576440	12581280	people online. That's because a lot of things had to go wrong in my Scottish life to become
12581280	12587440	a VTuber. That's why there's no Scottish VTubers. Do you know how? Oh no, I've hurt
12587440	12594440	myself. My finger is bleeding. Why? What did I cut myself on? I've not touched anything
12594440	12601440	sharp. Is there anything sharp in this room? Ouch. It stings. Hopefully I can still keep
12601440	12607440	gaming. Scotland only has one computer. No like genuinely, there's a reason why there's
12607440	12615440	not a lot of Scottish VTubers. If you genuinely like grew up around, well like grew up around
12615440	12621440	like normal friends, you would genuinely be like bullied so hard. Like bully culture like
12621440	12628440	in America and Australia and the UK is so prevalent. Like if you show any enjoyment or being slightly
12628440	12635440	different from the status quo, you get sicked on like a hound like sickum. It was crazy.
12635440	12641440	Pour some Azura milk on it honestly. I don't know, I can't remember how I cut myself. My
12641440	12650440	finger. I'm okay though. Someone says, hi Strony, I missed all of your livestreams,
12650440	12657440	rip. But I do have a few questions. What happens if one of the girls wants to leave? They leave?
12657440	12662440	Question mark? They get to go? We don't have a non-compete. I don't believe in them. I don't
12662440	12667440	think they're nice. They are not kind. If you no longer work for the Vealer agency, why
12667440	12674440	do you prevent you from making money elsewhere? That is called being messed up. Will you retire
12674440	12682440	the character? Yeah. Also if you can, what are the plans for Gen 2? Will you bring in
12682440	12692440	6 new girls and retire the other? If Gen 2 is the thing, there will be 6 new girls on
12692440	12698440	board. When Vealer agencies come out with Generations, everyone can be active at the
12698440	12704440	same time. It's not a problem. So Generation 1, all 6 active. Generation 2, all 6 active.
12704440	12707440	So that would be 12 total. Then if Generation 3 and everyone's happy with their cuts and
12707440	12714440	things are all nice and swimmingly, then Generation 3 and there will be a total of 18
12715440	12723440	Succubi and V Succubi. Wow. That's very daunting to think of but thank God I'm not the script
12723440	12728440	master anymore because if I was the script master, I could not stream. I genuinely could
12728440	12738440	not stream. There are absolutely no interest for any Generations after 3. No spin-off Generations.
12738440	12746440	No secret plans. No save for work Generations. None of that. I am exhausted. I took insane
12746440	12756440	amounts of HP damage getting Gen 1 out. I am ill. I want to get myself better and I'm
12756440	12766440	going to stream and I'm going to enjoy every second of it. But yeah, we are not having
12766440	12773440	to retire Gen 1 to get Gen 2 out. No. Sorry. Lastly, and this may be Taboo to ask. I'll
12773440	12785440	read it in my head. That is controversial. It's not controversial. What's an item you
12785440	12793440	would copy and steal from the other girls? Succubi's not. I will be taking no further
12793440	12801440	questions. Why is everything in Japanese? Are you weeb? Nothing's in Japanese. Actually
12801440	12808440	this is a fully English stream. There's nothing in Japanese at all here. What's going on?
12808440	12826440	How am I supposed to support the girls when you keep pulling me in? I'm pulling you into
12826440	12837440	my gravitational pull. Can't escape this gravitational pull. The website? Oh why Marshmallows
12837440	12846440	You'll never guess what country Marshmallow was made in. It was made in Japan. It's all
12846440	12857440	Japanese so Google. I use Firefox which does have a translator thing. Someone says please
12857440	12864440	William Wallis all over me. Oh yeah you like that. I don't know if this made it through
12864440	12878440	into twice. It's a PNG. Do we open it? Are we going to open it live on stream? Oh it's
12878440	12886440	me with my autism hair. I thought it was going to be something else. I had my autism hair.
12886440	12891440	I thought it was going to be something else. But I saw it was a PNG and I was like I'll
12891440	12902440	go for it. Okay I just quickly refreshed. We've got a few more and then we'll jump back
12902440	12923440	into their pay. Someone says check Smuttlefish hashtag. Hashtag is on safe mode. Show me the
12923440	12933440	goods. Smuttle did I spell it right? It's been hating? It's hidden for me? Check your search.
12933440	12951440	Hate sensitive media. Absolutely not. Show me the goods. There's two goods inside. Oh my god I have
12951440	12965440	faith. And my hair is so big and I'm sitting in a clam. And there's a second one. Oh my god there's
12965440	12973440	two. In the second one I say come closer to me. Have I got hypno eyes? Oh I've got hypno
12973440	12980440	eyes in the second one. Oh that's so good. They're so good. I love it. Thank you. I cannot
12980440	12986440	react to it because I'm on my minicum. But they're so good. There's three R's. I can't
12986440	12993440	see the third one. I only see two. Some accounts seem to be muted for me for some reason. I
12993440	13004440	can't see the third one. Only see two. I don't see it. It's not displaying. I don't know what's up
13004440	13028440	with Twitter. It's like really having a hard time. I see it. I have a tail. It looks like
13028440	13038440	three. Girls and viewers have a tail. No I have a tail. I have a leash. I have a leash. Oh
13038440	13052440	my god. Oh my god. Thank you. I love it. I have a leash. Oh it's so good. And the tail goes
13052440	13063440	green at the tip as well. Just like my horror. I'm going to stare at it for a very suspiciously
13063440	13075440	small amount of time later today. That's terrible. What are you doing to me? I should be the one
13075440	13087440	saying this to you. I accidentally... Thank you very much for that fanart. I like all fanart
13087440	13094440	actually. I need to put it in my folder. I have a folder of all the fanarts in so far.
13094440	13102440	Someone says, I loved your audios in the part where you talked about... Yeah you let me talk
13103440	13108440	about her baguette and go squishy with it. It's the nicotine patch under the bangs for
13108440	13113440	real. I don't actually have it. However I quite like the idea that we both have the nicotine
13113440	13119440	patch because we're both addicted to each other as we are each other. Yes, yes, yes. It doesn't
13119440	13126440	show up on my... Yeah it never showed up on my face. Hi strongy. I just want to say that's
13126440	13130440	really great how much you care about the progression of the other girls and your inspirational
13130440	13137440	speech in your first AC Brotherhood. You're a really cute person. I hope you have all great
13137440	13143440	and long careers. Also now I have a thing for the Scottish accent. Oh I do you like this big man?
13143440	13151440	Oh I am pure coming over to you like a satyabas coming to your house. You'll be sleeping in
13151440	13157440	your bed and then you'll feel my hundle over you. That's right and before you know it you've
13157440	13164440	popped abowny and it's all that funny. Is that what you want? Is that what you want?
13164440	13170440	Because you got it with me baby. Is Daystream another endurance stream? I have no idea. I'm
13170440	13176440	a bit nervous. I don't know if we can do 100% Assassin's Creed so we're just having fun.
13176440	13180440	Strongy is just an industry plant from the Scottish tourism board. Don't fall for it.
13180440	13186440	Don't fall for my tricks. You shouldn't come to Glasgow and spend all your hard earned money.
13186440	13193440	There's totally no amazing lovely tourist cafes in Glasgow.
13193440	13198440	Watching Austin Powers is going to hit different. I've never seen it. I'm so excited to watch
13198440	13209440	Austin Powers you guys. I think that's all the lovely Maru's I have. I is 411 Maru's.
13210440	13224440	Okay who's ready to replay this memory? Weirdly I haven't had an urge to visit Glasgow.
13224440	13237440	Scotland has turned to hypnotism. Wait did we not finish that memory? Oh we didn't. I thought
13237440	13244440	we did. I went away and got food. Nori nori.
13267440	13273440	Okay are you trying to get achievements? I'm going to see where it takes us. I don't know
13273440	13282440	if I can do 100%. My confidence as we played some of the DLCs has gone down significantly
13282440	13291440	because I don't know what the solution is to a few hundred percent. So if this game tells
13291440	13296440	me I have a new outfit unlocked one more time I'm going to cry. It's done it so much. How
13296440	13304440	does my browser all come to die directly to stories? Oh that's terrible. I need to start
13304440	13308440	retweeting stuff. Like I want to rule play with the R. I'm sorry I said it I don't care.
13308440	13312440	People find it cringe. Yeah you know what's cringe? Your VTuber never had any good time
13312440	13324440	with you. That's cringe. That's different. Hypnotic Scottish assessment.
13327440	13333440	Forbacione is such a specific word. Oh we are like that.
13337440	13342440	So we don't actually want to kill this archer because if we do his body is going to drop
13342440	13349440	down. See how it only got out. I'm going to pray the body doesn't fall right in front
13349440	13366440	of me. Don't do it ragdoll physics. I'm going to be mad. I might actually have to try hard
13366440	13370440	during this segment. I'm not to touch the ground and I'm not to get detected. I do have
13370440	13377440	issues. Are you trying to give me a heart attack because it's actually working me. You're
13377440	13382440	getting me concerned. I'm getting a bit concerned about how much you're launching. You're launching
13382440	13387440	yourself. He's at a rooftop. I have no idea if you guys can understand me when I start
13387440	13394440	doing that on purpose. Like being super scots on purpose. Or does it just sound like it's
13394440	13403440	just kind of like pleasant noises for you. I think we're just going to do that. Yeah
13404440	13411440	As long as his body doesn't go sliding down off I'm fine with everything that goes on.
13411440	13417440	I understand it. No it's pleasant. Oh my god you guys are so scots. If you can you're
13417440	13428440	actually getting pretty scots. Is it? Wait is that your literal translation of scots
13428440	13444440	there? Stop. What does that say? I'm like trying to reach out and play the game at the same time.
13444440	13448440	I'm actually such a skilled streamer. Sorry I played this game so much I couldn't do it.
13448440	13453440	There are some bits and pieces here and there but it's mostly understandable. Ah, tu comprendes?
13453440	13458440	Fuck it let's just go French. I'm surprisingly soothing. I'm definitely going to do a hard
13458440	13464440	Scottish accent ASMR. I don't know what I should do with it like tingle wise. Or maybe it should
13464440	13471440	just be like go to sleep mate. I'll get these. These are really coolant on your face and they
13471440	13476440	go bloop bloop bloop bloop. And it'll be really nice. It'll put you to sleep real quick. Oh
13476440	13480440	you still don't want to sleep right? Let me get the ear cleaner and snake. I think you
13480440	13486440	call it a Q-tip but it's actually called ear cleaner. That's the kind of ASMR I want to do.
13486440	13493440	Yes please. I'll just call it super scots ASMR and then people are like don't be silly.
13493440	13498440	There's no such thing as super scots ASMR and then they click the listen and they're like
13498440	13511440	they click to listen and they're like I understand now. I get it. Oh please don't ragdoll physics.
13511440	13519440	Do no drop. They cannot get past those cortisans huh? I feel like there's definitely more on the
13519440	13525440	map. I think that person yesterday was actually correct and said the more favour you gain with
13525440	13532440	the factions the more they appear on the map because all of a sudden I'm seeing zans everywhere.
13532440	13540440	His body is tempted to fold over. Literally it's like giving me a mini heart attack. Can I aim on you? Aim, aim, aim.
13540440	13547440	No aim bot, aim bot, aim bot. Just don't want to do it for me. It's really annoying when it does that.
13548440	13556440	That's not good. I really do not want that guy to be able to see me.
13556440	13565440	Oh no, no, no, don't, don't, don't. Yeah, didn't think so mate. Right, he's just discovered that body.
13565440	13574440	Do I desync because he sees the body or am I? I actually think I'm safe. You know that? I think I've done it.
13574440	13583440	Even though he sees the dead bodies of I, that's fine. Okay, we did it. We just have to hang out on this little edge.
13583440	13590440	Oh no we don't because there's freaking guards right there which I don't like. Hopefully we don't have a problem.
13590440	13600440	Scotch, want me to speak calmly while you enjoy a heart meal? Is it weird being the Scottish accent? No, it's not weird at all.
13600440	13617440	It sounds like home. A body? Just another day in the room. Honestly, if you've totaled how many SEOs joined, I feel like it's a really considerable number.
13618440	13624440	Wait, can I move on this? Do not be detected and do not touch the ground while tail in the centre.
13630440	13640440	I can touch the ground now, right? That's definitely not, I'm not. I swear if this is like we're broken it.
13640440	13649440	Yeah, okay, I was gonna say I was like that's the silliest thing I've ever heard if it's like you're not allowed to do it.
13652440	13654440	Celtic language is just assistant to me.
13655440	13659440	Oh, there's Scotch, there's Scotch. Can you get up please?
13662440	13664440	It's not mysterious.
13665440	13676440	Video embedding issues should now be fixed for all channels. We're not on Holodex, are we? Did you guys already get us on Holodex? There's no way.
13679440	13687440	Or are we? I thought it was like a view thing like you needed a certain amount of views ourselves or something.
13688440	13693440	Thanks, we suck.
13694440	13697440	There's an endy say. Ah, I confirm. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
13698440	13707440	Hopefully everyone's viewable and you can see what's up. Shibi's still alive, I believe, and we don't have a zero today.
13708440	13710440	I think it's a rest day for a zero if I'm not mistaken.
13710440	13722440	Okay, we're done. We did it, 100%. You're not, but you can still use the zero to create your own.
13723440	13726440	Not views, so I've got a 20 key average on channel, yeah.
13727440	13729440	It means about to go live, heck yeah. What's it mean to do in the day?
13730440	13734440	I would highly recommend in and out.
13735440	13740440	Yeah, the court is blocked us from being able to do the bench thing. I know how to do the bench thing, it's not a problem.
13745440	13747440	Oh, she's meme reviewing.
13747440	13749440	Come on, come on, come on.
13752440	13755440	Scots East, more strongly misunderstanding the listener's lack of accent.
13756440	13757440	We can't go in.
13758440	13764440	Fitty land, boy. Fitty land? Fitty land? Fitty land?
13769440	13771440	Well, you've succeeded in confusing me.
13772440	13774440	I'm back. Take a break to listen to music.
13778440	13780440	Hell, Claudia, the banker is here.
13781440	13784440	Oh, I have so much money to hire these lovely ladies.
13789440	13790440	I'm too good, literally.
13792440	13796440	Okay, Emmy live in... when? Soon?
13800440	13802440	Can't take the name of the music, so...
13802440	13803440	Beautiful.
13807440	13808440	Ciao bella.
13810440	13811440	Che cosa.
13814440	13817440	I don't want to get them on that sofa.
13820440	13822440	Oh, he's staring around.
13824440	13826440	No one's actually named it Luigi.
13829440	13831440	Darling Bratter sister, Emmy.
13833440	13836440	Darling Bratter. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy.
13837440	13843440	See, that five times fast. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy. Darling Bratter sister, Emmy.
13849440	13852440	But they are giggling away and won't stop losing.
13854440	13857440	Right, so take them and then go back to the full stack.
13858440	13860440	Because I don't want to get in any trouble.
13863440	13873440	I think we just got 50% DNA, so I think we might actually have...
13878440	13882440	I think we might actually have a new Pristina memory unlock.
13882440	13890440	If it's 25%, then 50%, then 75% like that reason said, then should we help?
13893440	13895440	I can protect you.
13896440	13897440	I can protect you?
13900440	13902440	Speaking of smoking, you're fortuitary friendly.
13903440	13906440	You want to go for it? No, nothing for me to say.
13912440	13915440	I'm trying so hard not to lose them to a guard right now.
13916440	13919440	I think we're okay with the render difference.
13920440	13923440	I have no idea what we're missing and not done yet.
13924440	13929440	We're replaying easy missions that I failed in order to get higher DNA sequence.
13929440	13936440	Pristina's story doesn't unlock until you have high synchronicity, so I'm having to go back and redo missions that are easy.
13936440	13938440	And that will raise our overall percentage.
13939440	13947440	And then we should be able to finish whatever happens with Pristina because it ended and it didn't make any sense at all.
13949440	13957440	We're done this part, we just need to do the benchmark now.
13959440	13962440	How far are you planning on taking Viola or dominating?
13962440	13963440	No, not dominating.
13963440	13967440	I just want the girls to achieve their dreams and achieve what they want to do.
13970440	13971440	Have a good time.
13972440	13974440	It's kind of like what are Viola's dreams?
13974440	13978440	Viola's dreams or whatever the girls' dreams are because we want them to be happy.
13980440	13983440	Interesting what about alcohol?
13983440	13985440	Oh, I can't have alcohol.
13985440	13987440	Have you guys drank its fine?
13987440	13988440	I'm going to stop you.
13990440	13994440	But yeah, alcohol and me don't go well.
13994440	13998440	It speeds up my heart rate, it makes me feel uncomfortable and I get...
13998440	14001440	I'm very late wait, even though I'm Scottish.
14001440	14004440	I'm so freaking late wait, it's so annoying.
14004440	14006440	I'm stinky, like why?
14009440	14011440	So I just can't really handle it.
14012440	14013440	I don't do it.
14013440	14016440	Also there's been like tons of reports that come out where alcohol is really bad.
14016440	14020440	But I'm not going to say no to like drunk karaoke streams or something like that.
14021440	14024440	I kind of learned that...
14029440	14035440	So when you feel a buzz from alcohol, you don't have to drink any further than that point to keep the buzz going.
14035440	14037440	That's not how alcohol works.
14037440	14040440	I only recently learned that back anyway.
14040440	14044440	But I won't be shy of doing like drunk karaoke.
14046440	14048440	I'll drink for the both of us honestly.
14048440	14051440	There's less of you to fill alcohol with.
14054440	14055440	Oh, please excuse me.
14055440	14058440	I'm holding B, please excuse me.
14059440	14063440	Ladies, ladies, sync with me my goodness.
14063440	14065440	Work with me here.
14068440	14070440	No Guinness for strong.
14070440	14073440	I actually like drinking beer.
14074440	14078440	It's probably the only thing I can handle at the moment.
14080440	14082440	Please remember to drink water if you do drink it.
14082440	14085440	Yes, I did not want any issues.
14085440	14088440	What's the way to celebrate my birthday?
14088440	14092440	Than to join in the brotherhood of man.
14093440	14096440	Soon, we will be here once more.
14096440	14099440	Celebrating a new night.
14100440	14106440	And then the feasting will last for 40 days and 40 nights.
14106440	14108440	Not even the girlies drink?
14108440	14112440	I mean, Shibi is live right now doing drunk ASMR.
14114440	14116440	I don't know, I just never...
14116440	14119440	I never had like going out friends.
14119440	14121440	Let go like...
14124440	14127440	Like nightclub or rave or any of that.
14127440	14131440	Which is where a lot of drinking culture comes into play in the UK.
14133440	14137440	The aim when you go out with your friends is to get plastered.
14137440	14141440	Which is just not very pleasant.
14143440	14145440	Chesering full plated armour.
14145440	14149440	If only we had a very strong kneecap.
14151440	14153440	Sure would be a shame.
14153440	14155440	Oh, I did a challenge.
14157440	14162440	Right, let's do this without getting in trouble this time.
14164440	14166440	You go away.
14166440	14168440	Thank you very much.
14168440	14171440	Right, and then you stop so I can go in this blend spot.
14171440	14175440	No, you're right in front of me. This is what we didn't want last time.
14181440	14184440	Half my friend group loved getting hammered and half did not.
14184440	14188440	Yeah, like I didn't really experience any of that.
14188440	14191440	So it just never really became a thing.
14192440	14194440	And like obviously hang up.
14194440	14196440	Right, I definitely can do this thing.
14196440	14198440	Yeah, okay, easy peasy.
14198440	14200440	100% right there.
14202440	14205440	I was the Disney driver on my 21st birthday.
14205440	14212440	Oh, that's right. 21 is a drinking age in your country.
14216440	14218440	Honestly, I'm going to happy here.
14220440	14222440	I'm going out or getting good at it.
14222440	14225440	It was going out or getting good at AC Brotherhood.
14225440	14228440	Literally, I like just play video games all day.
14229440	14234440	I'm sure it is fun if you're into it, but like I just have no interest.
14234440	14239440	I have an interest in like doing like tipsy streams or like drunk review of movies.
14239440	14241440	Okay.
14244440	14246440	Not again.
14250440	14252440	Did it twice.
14252440	14256440	I'm sure there's a freaking hay bale down there or something.
14257440	14259440	Drinking with good family friends is probably getting me.
14259440	14261440	Well, you're getting hammered.
14261440	14264440	Well, you were out there getting hammered.
14264440	14267440	I was exio al dottori himself.
14267440	14269440	Right.
14269440	14272440	Wait, those missions only went up to sync to 51%.
14272440	14276440	So didn't you, Christina, get unlocked at 50%?
14279440	14281440	Oh.
14282440	14284440	What do you mean?
14284440	14287440	I've only done 50% of the game.
14292440	14294440	Ah, right.
14294440	14297440	Those ones are difficult, so I actually don't want to do them.
14297440	14299440	What's this one?
14299440	14301440	The Baron de Voix.
14301440	14303440	Gatekeeper 50-50.
14303440	14305440	What are you?
14307440	14309440	Don't lose any health squares.
14312440	14313440	Okay, this one's super easy.
14313440	14314440	We can do this one.
14314440	14317440	I'm literally doing it easiest to hardest.
14317440	14319440	Then we'll get hard at the end.
14321440	14323440	How should I beat you first try and get clues?
14323440	14325440	Sorry, I need something like that because it's not very nice.
14325440	14328440	Because like I completely understand that.
14331440	14332440	I did it again.
14332440	14334440	It makes that noise.
14334440	14337440	I think that must be an audio mistake or something because...
14337440	14340440	Your men can overpower the camp's patrols, correct?
14340440	14341440	Yes.
14341440	14343440	I was studying the hidden bleed.
14343440	14345440	I was such an Assassin's Creed fanboy.
14345440	14352440	I used to think it would be so cool if I got like the Assassin's Creed logo branded on my finger.
14352440	14355440	I was so impressionable as a child.
14355440	14357440	You're truly a man after my own heart.
14357440	14359440	So impressionable.
14359440	14360440	Not very smart.
14360440	14361440	It's kind of character.
14361440	14362440	I will get the armor.
14362440	14364440	My troops will gather it from the dead.
14364440	14367440	The stream tomorrow is a native streamer overload.
14367440	14369440	Native streamer overload.
14369440	14371440	It's actually a pretty good pill for me.
14374440	14376440	Next, small fish, the AC logo in tattoo.
14376440	14379440	Only refilling Assassins allowed inside.
14381440	14383440	Okay, if this is just don't be...
14383440	14386440	Actually, well, I am here.
14390440	14392440	No, not while I'm here.
14392440	14393440	We have to do it outside of the mission.
14393440	14397440	No, I always go that way and it's like the longest way to find anyone.
14406440	14408440	That's a good reason that young people can't get tattoos.
14408440	14411440	Yes, I would like to be sitting here with like a freaking branded fingers.
14411440	14415440	Probably the Sega logo on me at one point as well for...
14418440	14420440	Don't get detected.
14421440	14424440	For Sonic Heroes.
14424440	14426440	I always loved it when it was like Sega.
14429440	14431440	Did that not alert anyone?
14431440	14434440	They're actually so efficient at fighting that it didn't alert anyone.
14435440	14437440	What do you guys get?
14437440	14439440	Okay, Assassins are pretty high level.
14439440	14441440	I'm pretty sure they can handle what's going to happen.
14442440	14444440	Oh, there's a patrol route.
14444440	14446440	Oh, there's a big old fight going on.
14447440	14450440	Okay, we're at five costumes.
14450440	14452440	They're still going for it.
14452440	14455440	Whoa, they're getting beaten up by the big guys.
14457440	14458440	Oh, they're fighting back.
14458440	14459440	They're beating them up.
14459440	14461440	Four to two.
14461440	14462440	Oh, she lost the health bar.
14462440	14464440	Wow, I actually thought the...
14464440	14465440	Oh, they're going for this.
14465440	14466440	They're doing it.
14466440	14467440	They're doing it.
14467440	14469440	They're going for the patrolers as well.
14469440	14471440	Oh, we got ten in that one.
14471440	14473440	That was a really good one.
14474440	14475440	What's over here?
14475440	14477440	Another French battalion thing.
14480440	14482440	When needy streamer overload, okay.
14482440	14485440	I think that's definitely going to be a shorter stream.
14485440	14487440	However, when I do have shorter streams,
14487440	14489440	I'm going to be working on ASMR collabs and stuff,
14489440	14491440	so there's not going to be more content coming.
14492440	14494440	I'm going to cry here.
14495440	14496440	Let's see.
14499440	14502440	Oh, that's actually for two assassins
14502440	14504440	to take on that big old group.
14504440	14505440	That's quite a lot.
14505440	14507440	Yeah, one of them just lost a health bar.
14508440	14513440	I actually think I'm going to have to send in more assassins.
14514440	14516440	Oh, they've lost two health bars.
14516440	14518440	This is getting juicy.
14518440	14520440	Oh, the other one's lost one as well.
14521440	14522440	Oh, it's getting juicy.
14522440	14523440	It's getting juicy.
14523440	14525440	Oh, there's losing three.
14525440	14528440	I don't want to get detected because that will ruin this little sequence,
14528440	14530440	but I will call in the next card.
14531440	14532440	There you go.
14532440	14533440	There you go.
14534440	14536440	I have no idea what's going on over there.
14536440	14538440	I don't want to get detected to ruin it, but...
14538440	14540440	Oh, he's on two.
14540440	14541440	Okay.
14548440	14549440	Help him!
14550440	14551440	Freaking...
14554440	14555440	Ah.
14556440	14557440	Jeez.
14557440	14559440	Okay, I definitely need to level up the gang
14559440	14561440	because they are still not strong enough for this.
14563440	14564440	Stop.
14564440	14565440	Oh, my goodness.
14565440	14567440	No, don't pick on a guard, please.
14574440	14575440	Oh, right.
14575440	14577440	Everyone despawn right this instant.
14579440	14580440	My heart.
14580440	14581440	Right.
14581440	14582440	They'll heal up.
14582440	14584440	Whenever your assassin is low, they'll heal up.
14586440	14587440	I thought we lost them.
14587440	14589440	Oh, my goodness.
14591440	14592440	I thought we...
14592440	14593440	I was like...
14593440	14595440	I called in another assassin on that guy
14595440	14597440	that was in particular his harasser.
14597440	14598440	I was like, where are they?
14598440	14599440	Where are they?
14599440	14600440	Like, where are they going from?
14600440	14601440	And I was like, oh, wait.
14601440	14602440	I can shoot off my horse.
14602440	14604440	Like, I can still attack, technically.
14605440	14607440	I just need to not be discovered.
14607440	14608440	That's all.
14608440	14612440	I'm gonna wait to call in my assassins to do this.
14612440	14614440	I really don't want to actually get caught.
14614440	14616440	I'll be annoyed at myself if I do.
14617440	14619440	There's another guard post all the way over here.
14622440	14623440	Excuse me.
14623440	14624440	Pardon me, come through.
14626440	14627440	Oh, wow.
14627440	14628440	Yeah.
14628440	14630440	There's a big one over here.
14632440	14633440	Maybe...
14633440	14634440	Big like mine.
14635440	14637440	Okay, let's just send in guards.
14637440	14638440	Eh, guards.
14638440	14639440	And like this.
14641440	14642440	Fill health already.
14642440	14643440	There you go.
14643440	14644440	Hold on.
14644440	14645440	Super simple.
14645440	14646440	Super easy.
14646440	14647440	Got 100%.
14647440	14649440	Literally, that's all I had to do last time.
14649440	14651440	I wonder if I didn't have all, I say,
14651440	14652440	a...
14652440	14653440	Signals?
14653440	14654440	Um...
14654440	14655440	Doing.
14655440	14657440	Oh, no, my track is bugging out again.
14657440	14658440	Please stop.
14658440	14659440	What's this one?
14659440	14661440	Don't take any damage.
14661440	14663440	Don't lose any health squares.
14664440	14666440	That one's not easy
14666440	14669440	because of how many enemies can just swing at you.
14669440	14671440	And that first one...
14673440	14674440	I'll try it.
14675440	14678440	Do I plan on unlocking all the endings on Needy Streamer?
14678440	14680440	I don't know how much I'm gonna like it.
14680440	14682440	I'm gonna play it for the first time.
14682440	14684440	I think it's like a click game, which honestly
14684440	14686440	might make it super simple.
14686440	14688440	If I like it, then I'll try and get all endings
14688440	14689440	if I don't like it.
14689440	14691440	And then I'll probably just do a few runs and then
14691440	14694440	have a short stream and then I'll work on ASMR.
14694440	14695440	That sounds like a deal.
14696440	14697440	Surprise me.
14697440	14699440	The French puttane have us under pressure.
14699440	14701440	Tell me about their general.
14701440	14702440	These...
14702440	14703440	Baron de Valois.
14704440	14706440	Some major is just the, like,
14706440	14708440	the hmm option.
14709440	14710440	And over and over again.
14710440	14711440	Where can I find him?
14711440	14712440	To watch the bed.
14712440	14714440	Wait, do I need to censor the stream?
14715440	14717440	Is it safe to stream it?
14717440	14719440	They seem to be getting closer.
14719440	14721440	The situation is under control.
14722440	14723440	Close the gates!
14723440	14724440	Needy Strony overload.
14724440	14726440	Oh, I should have named it that.
14726440	14727440	I'm taking that.
14727440	14728440	Thank you.
14728440	14729440	No, you can do it.
14729440	14730440	Okay.
14730440	14731440	Right.
14731440	14732440	Don't take any damage.
14736440	14737440	I'm gonna do that.
14738440	14740440	So that stops them.
14741440	14743440	Okay, that's what I'm nervous about.
14743440	14744440	Them doing that.
14744440	14746440	And I don't have a freaking smoke bomb.
14746440	14747440	I have...
14747440	14749440	I don't have any more smoke bombs.
14750440	14752440	Right.
14752440	14755440	Oh, I think I might need to...
14755440	14757440	Oh, I can call in my recruits.
14759440	14760440	Oh, my God.
14760440	14761440	Please don't attack me.
14761440	14763440	I really don't want to lose health over this.
14765440	14768440	I can't see because of the camera angle.
14770440	14771440	I'm scared.
14771440	14772440	I'm scared.
14772440	14773440	I'm going for it.
14773440	14774440	I'm sending it.
14774440	14775440	I'm sending it.
14775440	14776440	Please don't attack me.
14776440	14777440	Please don't attack me.
14778440	14780440	Okay, my assassin recruits are going ham.
14780440	14781440	That's what I like to see.
14784440	14786440	They're stuck outside.
14788440	14789440	Assassin, please.
14789440	14790440	Jeez.
14790440	14792440	Are you trying to make me lose?
14793440	14794440	Jeez.
14794440	14796440	Is there anyone else?
14799440	14800440	Wait, what?
14800440	14801440	On air?
14802440	14804440	I've never seen this before.
14805440	14807440	I guess I'll just...
14807440	14809440	Wait, they keep seeing me, though.
14809440	14810440	I can't...
14810440	14813440	So the AI can't actually see me,
14813440	14815440	but it keeps claiming it is.
14815440	14816440	It's not.
14816440	14818440	I think I'm just going to shoot them.
14819440	14820440	I can.
14820440	14821440	Oh, I can.
14821440	14822440	I'm getting them.
14823440	14824440	Okay, that was...
14824440	14825440	Okay, we did it.
14825440	14826440	We did it.
14826440	14827440	We did it.
14830440	14831440	It's just heavily implied.
14831440	14832440	It's more of a win-win-win-nothing.
14832440	14833440	Okay.
14835440	14837440	He did it too well.
14839440	14840440	He dumped people in us.
14841440	14843440	Blame them with your ink.
14846440	14847440	Maybe I should have had an ink toy,
14847440	14849440	but what would have been funny is anything.
14849440	14850440	Like, I'd just go...
14850440	14852440	And it was all in screen.
14853440	14854440	Oh, no!
14866440	14868440	Didn't the developers also make another game?
14869440	14870440	A whale after?
14870440	14871440	Oh, I think so.
14872440	14873440	Hello!
14873440	14874440	Hello, everyone!
14875440	14876440	How are you?
14877440	14878440	Today...
14878440	14879440	I...
14881440	14882440	I...
14882440	14883440	I...
14883440	14884440	I...
14884440	14885440	I...
14885440	14886440	I...
14886440	14887440	I...
14887440	14888440	I...
14888440	14889440	I...
14892440	14894440	Yeah, I can't speak none of that.
14897440	14898440	Okay.
14898440	14900440	Okay, I think we just need to go back and forth
14900440	14902440	and not get attacked by anything,
14902440	14903440	which is super simple.
14909440	14910440	Oops.
14913440	14915440	Maybe part of a 2.0 or a new output.
14915440	14916440	Why is your French so good?
14916440	14917440	No, it's nothing else.
14919440	14921440	Don't understand the French.
14921440	14923440	No, I don't understand it.
14923440	14924440	Oh, no, my eyes.
14924440	14925440	Sorry, sorry.
14925440	14926440	Sorry.
14928440	14929440	I actually don't know any French.
14929440	14931440	I literally know phrases.
14931440	14933440	And I record to take the same phrases.
14934440	14937440	If you would like to order a ham and cheese baguette,
14937440	14938440	you say...
14944440	14946440	I forgot what cheese is.
14946440	14947440	A baguette.
14950440	14951440	Well, that didn't...
14951440	14953440	That didn't work out very well.
14953440	14954440	No.
14954440	14955440	Baguette.
14957440	14959440	Well, it sounds good coming from a French speaker.
14959440	14961440	Oh, thank you.
14961440	14963440	How are you doing?
14964440	14965440	How are you?
14965440	14966440	Huh?
14966440	14967440	Are you okay?
14967440	14968440	Oh, wait, that was for a joke.
14971440	14972440	What's the French password?
14972440	14973440	Hmm...
14973440	14974440	I don't know.
14974440	14976440	I don't know.
14976440	14977440	One...
14977440	14978440	Two...
14978440	14979440	One baguette.
14979440	14980440	And one...
14980440	14981440	Ramon.
14982440	14984440	Who wants me to play with you?
14990440	14992440	That's like, I'm literally just regurgitating.
14992440	14994440	Do I have higher education?
14994440	14996440	That sounds like I have higher education.
14996440	14997440	That's just new.
14998440	14999440	Reason of barn.
14999440	15001440	Uneducated in the barn.
15001440	15002440	And became a gamer.
15002440	15003440	Hell yeah.
15008440	15009440	Ray.
15009440	15011440	I'm a bit scared of this one.
15011440	15013440	Don't lose any health squares.
15016440	15018440	I actually don't want to do that one
15018440	15019440	because it takes too long.
15019440	15021440	Right, we're at 52%.
15021440	15022440	So every time I do a memory,
15022440	15025440	I'm getting like up to 5%.
15026440	15029440	Use assassin recruits to do your targets.
15029440	15032440	Okay, we're actually factually
15032440	15035440	going to upgrade our assassin recruits.
15035440	15036440	Which...
15036440	15037440	Sorry, I just closed this,
15037440	15039440	but we actually needed to open it.
15040440	15043440	If I do this, they get...
15044440	15046440	Okay, we just need to send them on missions.
15046440	15049440	If we get 5 assassins level 10,
15049440	15052440	the assassin's recruit signal
15052440	15054440	replenishes so much faster.
15054440	15057440	I think it takes off like 20 seconds.
15057440	15059440	Which, in the grand scheme of things,
15059440	15061440	like adds up so quickly.
15061440	15063440	How much money do I have on my purseings?
15064440	15067440	13k, right, I don't have enough right.
15067440	15069440	We'll just go and...
15069440	15071440	We'll send them on...
15071440	15072440	Missions.
15073440	15075440	Like the pigeons.
15075440	15078440	Oh, it was like dead ahead, dead center.
15078440	15080440	I remembered an Italian swear.
15080440	15082440	I'll use it in a sentence.
15082440	15086440	I didn't even know that.
15086440	15087440	I know catso.
15087440	15089440	And merda.
15089440	15092440	Oh, we put 50 grand in the bank?
15092440	15094440	50 smacaroons.
15094440	15097440	Right, we're going to send away our agents.
15097440	15099440	Because I want some of them to level up
15099440	15101440	so then we can get faster.
15104440	15106440	I have no one at 10 yet.
15106440	15107440	What?
15107440	15108440	You guys...
15108440	15110440	Oh, you're getting close.
15110440	15112440	Right, I just need to send them away.
15112440	15115440	Maybe do a mission that doesn't require them.
15116440	15118440	And then we can get the...
15119440	15120440	Upgrade.
15120440	15123440	5, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
15123440	15125440	If you guys all go...
15126440	15128440	I think...
15128440	15130440	1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
15130440	15132440	Oh, I don't want to risk the room.
15132440	15134440	If it fails...
15134440	15137440	I'm like 99% sure they come back all perished.
15137440	15141440	If it fails, which is like pretty unforgiven.
15143440	15145440	Honestly, your openness and no manners
15145440	15147440	is one of the reasons why I like...
15150440	15152440	Oh, that's funny.
15156440	15158440	Right, missions, missions, missions.
15158440	15160440	Wait, they don't have...
15162440	15165440	17 minutes for that mission?
15165440	15167440	Is really not.
15167440	15171440	Is there not another level 5 regular contract?
15173440	15174440	There's no...
15174440	15176440	Oh, these are all level 5s.
15176440	15179440	All four of you go together.
15179440	15181440	And you're humble, little thing.
15185440	15187440	Alright, as an Italian myself,
15187440	15189440	I have to say here in the dub for Italian phrases
15189440	15191440	another language is cringe.
15191440	15193440	Oh, you don't want to hear me say
15193440	15197440	Spingy, Spingy, Ayuto, Ayuto!
15197440	15200440	Ayus meus, Dios me...
15200440	15202440	Wait, no, that's Spanish.
15203440	15205440	Right, we're going to go to a bank.
15206440	15209440	Ummmmm
15209440	15213440	the Bangkok, Bangkok, Bangkok, Bangkok

15303400	15309200	to flag go to the percentage because I feel like the DNA sequence doesn't is like so
15311960	15315440	Rough colonel standards use that something I can't do that. Just yeah
15315440	15320400	Don't be detected like I don't like the
15321680	15324920	Beat Chesery to the apple of Eden. Don't hurt anyone
15329240	15331240	Cuz they're all attacking you
15334080	15337400	Beat Chesery to the apple Eden don't hurt anyone
15346440	15352260	Mmm, I have my hand over my mouth thinking I'm oh, I don't have any smoke bombs
15355560	15361060	I don't have any smoke bombs on my person so I can't get away with that fried all fried by far
15365640	15370680	Yeah, for sure, would you like if you heard an Italian speak your navel image sure might not be some bad
15371000	15373240	But you know the accent can pack a punch
15374120	15376120	Oh
15379040	15381040	So
15381840	15387560	Okay, yeah, the layers of Romeo the war machine. Oh, oh
15390000	15392000	Wait, do these have a percentage
15394480	15396480	No, these don't have a percentage
15397360	15399360	Oh
15403600	15406280	Okay, this is why our thing is so low
15408880	15415680	Okay, okay, we're gonna do assassin's contracts wherever the heck they are that's why the freaking percentage is so low
15416480	15418080	these
15418080	15419360	symbols
15419360	15421360	the pigeon
15422240	15426900	Like these ones is it that assassin contract, right? Okay. Okay. I
15427760	15432760	Was gonna say because it's not making a lot of sense why the percentage is so low
15432760	15435800	There's only a few missions that haven't done a hundred percent on
15436880	15441840	I'm gonna be honest and I don't think we're gonna hundred percent it
15441840	15445200	But we definitely finished the game and I'm sat aside
15446200	15451320	That after like the stream, we don't need to hop back on black a on black ops on brotherhood
15454840	15458840	Hey, cuz I'm satisfied with the play through
15461440	15465800	Cuz yeah, I don't actually have much me okay, so I just need to kind of do all the
15466560	15474020	Black markers on the map really maybe factions also half of it if I get like a hundred percent favor in the factions as well
15476200	15478920	Okay, see yummy, honestly
15482400	15485840	It's been very close it's it's more of a cozy day
15485840	15488840	I think yesterday like I used up a lot of my energy on a rifle
15489120	15492720	Just like being like gushing about this game and being like it's getting so cool
15495040	15499840	Today it's like it's definitely cozy. It's definitely have a little blankie on you and make sure you're comfy
15500600	15501800	I
15501800	15507280	Yesterday I was screaming my head off like just loving everything and so energetic
15508040	15512960	But like that get to be like that unapologetically cuz like nothing's worse than like
15514080	15516760	being excited for something and then
15517520	15522880	Someone's like, oh, you're being really loud and obnoxious. So just like kills like oh, this is a lot of me
15522880	15526960	Like I'm having such a good time. You never met someone who's like genuinely excited for
15527160	15535200	Yes faction challenges are also part of the percentage of the contract no not like contract
15536720	15538720	Mission
15541200	15546000	Chesery hopes that our rebels will stumble into his line of fire his expected come and wait instructions
15547280	15553040	Kill the three targets in two minutes. Oh my god. These have freaking things as well
15553840	15562080	Oh, okay, I'm starting to understand why our DNA think is so unbelievably low
15573920	15575920	Oh, he's just that range
15576560	15582880	Wait under three minutes three gunmen and under
15585360	15589600	They're not that far away. Okay, I guess the assassin's contracts are super nice
15590400	15595440	Because this guy's on that far away. Oh like that was like super reasonable
15602400	15604400	Oh, I can't reach that
15606240	15608240	Oh
15609760	15611760	That quick
15612320	15618320	Okay, I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'll I'll I'll meet ankles
15619440	15622880	I'm out of medicine. Oh and smoke worms
15624640	15626640	Oh, there's a doctor over here. That's perfect
15626640	15628640	Oh
15635360	15637360	What was out of medicine
15639440	15647200	I've seen the thing is I don't look soldiers bodies so I don't get anything from him. He'll heal me. You should heal myself. No
15652080	15654320	Do the feathers count as DNA or possibly
15655280	15657280	You don't need ankle
15658160	15662400	Right, so literally just do the pigeon clips and then it's going up
15663760	15669600	Oh, yeah, 53 percent. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let him get up. Let him get up 53 percent. Uh, how do you go up there?
15671200	15676000	That looks like a hell to me. It looks like a bit of an in slope a bit of an incline
15676000	15678000	I
15684400	15687360	Think tomorrow I'm going to say
15688400	15692160	Which means I need to take a shower put deodorant on
15693520	15695520	I need to pretend
15695520	15697520	I'm a normal person
15697840	15702000	I'm teasing. I do not stink all the time. Wait. What was 100 percent?
15702960	15708720	Assassinate three guards with a hidden blade. You do not have to tell me anything more. I assure you
15709840	15711840	Hidden blade is wiggle
15717520	15718720	Oh
15718720	15720720	They're on horsies
15720960	15722960	I love when they're on horsies
15723040	15728960	Hello, would you like to die? I oh, okay. Hold on. Let me try the game. Would you like to die?
15729920	15731680	One
15731680	15737760	They're all on horses. No wonder the game's like do they're all on horses. How am I supposed to do this?
15738960	15740960	Hello, would you like to die?
15741200	15743200	Hello, would you like to die? No
15743440	15745760	Yes, wait, I did it 100 percent already
15746480	15750800	Skill okay. Wait. Wait. Hold on. It's fine. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic. Let him get up
15750800	15753440	Let him get up. Oh, no, no, no. Don't spank the horse
15754880	15756480	Wait, wait, wait. Get him because he's got a bow
15757120	15760080	Why does it not? Do I need to like jump up onto the horse?
15762960	15764960	Ow, you're hurting me
15766000	15767280	Okay
15767280	15771760	Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me cook. Let me cook. Yes. They got off the horse by automatic
15774160	15776880	Okay, easy peasy lemon squeezy. You're next
15777680	15778880	No, you're not
15778880	15780880	Are you coming?
15781040	15786080	Yes, there. Get him. Three, two, one. Oh, oh, I missed it. I missed it. I missed the timing source
15788640	15790640	It's never too late
15791360	15793360	Hope the weather's nicer for you. It's mild
15794160	15796160	33 degrees
15799840	15804960	That's too much for me. I'll I'll pass right. I guess we're gonna do Leonardo as well
15805840	15807840	Oh
15808640	15813040	Right, there's another one if we do that the assassin mission seemed like super fair
15814160	15818000	Some of it buys for them right now and we can generate more money by sending
15818720	15822800	Are we assassins to get more exp? I'm gonna need a horse for this
15824880	15831120	I said I'm gonna need to wait. I'm blind. I just passed off on the horse. Sorry mate. My apologies
15835760	15840720	Uh, if it's super easy to do the assassin contracts, we'll just do them get them out of the way and then
15841520	15844320	Hopefully that's like our percentage raised by like five
15845440	15847440	That's pretty good
15851520	15854880	Uh, actually I could also use these mercenaries
15856480	15858480	Well, I can't right now
15859360	15861360	Uh
15862320	15863680	We're just
15863680	15869680	Trying to do what we can. It's very unlikely. We're gonna 100% it, but I'm enjoying myself thoroughly
15870000	15876000	Uh, I'm actually gonna go get a blanket because I'm putting my legs on the table and I'm killing circulation to my leg
15876080	15878320	I'll just be a second. I don't need to mute so you can
15879280	15881280	Uh, was it
15888480	15890480	I
15912560	15915360	Have my lovely blanket to protect my leg
15915680	15919200	Because the circulation is dying because I pressed them so hard against the table
15919840	15923200	They ain't sitting on my feet. I'm cutting the circulation out of my leg
15928880	15930880	All right, my chair is like so quicky
15935280	15940000	Right have we got any level 10? No we don't. It was a smaller mission
15940000	15942000	I
15944640	15946640	Screen shot that
15949120	15951120	That's an interesting
15952560	15956960	I'm supposed to close my eyes before I leave like so the thing looks right, but
15960000	15962000	I'm just gonna keep sending people to
15962960	15964640	Do more um
15964640	15969200	Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb. I was supposed to accept uh, assassination contract
15970720	15972720	missions
15972880	15974400	The ball on the
15974400	15979200	Choose company kill both targets for your hidden belief. You do not have to tell me twice
15980080	15984400	I'm loving these assassin missions. Are you joking me?
15987120	15989920	I assume I don't have to get on a horse to reach them
15992400	15994400	But we're getting pretty far
15995360	15999280	Uh, I can't tell which one's closer
16001680	16003680	Eh, what is this?
16004480	16010000	The wheat. Oh, wow. They're like, okay, actually it's closer to a door than four. Let's do that
16012560	16014960	By Austria and Switzerland just 26 right now
16014960	16016960	Oh
16019760	16025280	Literally the assassin missions are like so easy and like um, um, we might be like 57
16026080	16029040	Once by the time we're finished them if they make them this easy then
16029760	16031760	Yeah
16035200	16036960	If you die
16036960	16042960	Your assassin rule before promoting them a max their cape match will be that color. I have no sense
16045920	16047920	Wait that
16049600	16058480	Assassin contracts are so easy. I love it here. What the heck no like don't be detected and there's 18 billion like guards looking at you
16059680	16065440	Shout out to assassin contracts. Hello. I can't believe how easy these are
16068960	16071920	Oh, excuse me mr. Horsey yet in Maui
16072880	16079840	The 68% finish is that where we'll end on 60% I'll give the Leonardo missions ago
16085760	16088480	It would be nice 100% but my goodness, I didn't know
16089920	16096080	I'll see what happens by the end of this stream like I didn't I thought I was only going to do six hours today
16096480	16098480	Hi, I'm sorry
16098560	16100400	Bye
16100560	16102560	Um
16103680	16105680	What percentage are we now in like 54
16107360	16114320	55 I love it here says 55. Oh my god more contact. Please. They're so easy. Is there any more?
16115840	16117680	No, but there's
16117680	16119680	Templar agents
16119920	16126160	Okay, we're going to do Templar agents. I'm totally not stalling on the Leonardo missions because I know they're a bit tricky
16130960	16136880	Last Christina needs 75 percent. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're gonna do it. We're gonna do it
16137520	16141360	I mean, honestly, it might be one of those things where I'm like
16142400	16144400	We'll do what we can
16144720	16146720	I actually don't know how long we're gonna
16147520	16152000	Like stream today. As I said, I was only planning on doing
16153680	16156880	Six hours ish, but I mean we're already getting close to that mark
16156960	16164320	It's already been four hours and a half. Yeah, and I'm like I don't really feel like I'm out of stamina right now
16164800	16165600	for stream
16165600	16166400	so
16166400	16168400	Yeah, and like especially tomorrow
16168880	16173680	Depended on like how much I like the game. It might only be a tour stream which kind of is a bit meh
16174880	16176000	um
16176000	16177360	I believe
16177360	16180320	Anything called love just listen to the rhythm of your heart
16180480	16182480	Da da da da da da da da da
16189440	16194160	Yeah, literally it may be one of those things where I end up actually getting so close that we do just go
16194240	16196240	Oh wait, the bank. I can collect money from it
16198160	16199760	Eh
16199760	16202080	Oh, no, I've already collected my money. Oh, please
16204000	16206800	I suppose once we buy the last, um
16206800	16220560	how you call them, touristic locations, then we'll shall.
16220560	16224000	I'm trying to do the faction challenges, like on the way there.
16224000	16228920	Yeah, like I need to hire thieves to lure people away.
16228920	16233840	You need to do it 10 times like through their quest then.
16233840	16235840	I just need to find enemies
16239960	16241960	Yeah, just like that
16244120	16247320	We need to complete Christina literally
16248600	16251880	Right, what's this? Hi. Are you okay? Oh?
16252800	16254800	It's not looking good
16255480	16257480	She's beating up
16257480	16259480	Don't
16260840	16263420	I will not touch you what happened here
16267480	16271400	He owns this neighborhood that border I have given it to him
16271480	16274160	He once made signs for the shops in the district
16274520	16279560	But now he post lies for the border and hurt those who stand in his way. Wow
16281040	16286480	Where is he? He spends his days locking his workshop, but I may know how to go them out
16287480	16293080	What we're doing kill your target with the hidden blue. I love these missions. What the heck?
16295840	16299640	Yesterday said eight hours on the end of being 12 it would have been 14 I
16300840	16308080	Don't know maybe one day they'll fix the vod issue if the day comes where they fix that vod issue
16308640	16315600	Please let me know because it is over for your sleep schedule. I'm talking we wake up
16315600	16320900	We brush our teeth. We get our food and then we stream 14 hours
16330240	16333360	Wait, it's the doctor what was to do? Oh, no, it's the same
16335320	16337320	Interact oh
16337880	16340680	We're pulling down propaganda my apologies. I
16342040	16344040	Didn't know
16344760	16350760	Can you at least reserve the weekends? Yeah, oh you need a break from my stamina. You're so adorable refling
16351200	16353200	There's no breaks on this tree. I
16354160	16356160	Was gonna say something else there
16361240	16364340	We're pulling down propaganda it's useless posters
16366480	16369000	Sleep is already ruined what's a lot more room
16369920	16371920	I
16376000	16382520	Like I'm trying to do this like obviously they did the poster grab and things
16383120	16390640	When you've got no right, but I didn't realize they like we use that actually like the concept because obviously like whenever you think of the
16390640	16395680	Past you're like, how did all these people like even get caught for crimes like it just seems so
16395920	16397920	Oh
16398240	16400240	Kill your target with them
16401320	16406800	Can I rip it down or are they gonna be mad at me? Okay, that's exactly odd up smoke bombs
16410080	16412080	We're just so that length
16412200	16414240	Well, whoa, whoa, I wasn't even yes
16414240	16419200	See that's what I get annoyed with if you don't enter combat before they whack you you can't count us
16419760	16421840	And I look you can't see one boom, but yeah
16421840	16428000	I might be able to get a smoke bomb off of this guy for a little which I would actually really appreciate in case
16429960	16434520	Ancient room graffiti you see the walls the Pompey. We're at oh, yes. He does give me a smoke bomb. That was lucky
16435840	16437840	I'll definitely try and remember to oh
16445440	16448120	So when we pull this down I assume we get to meet the guy
16449120	16454440	Oh, we lure him out of his workshop because we've filled all those posters down, okay
16455800	16457800	We can definitely do
16460040	16465160	Other fan bases be looking at we feel like a man dying of dehydration watching another man drowning
16465640	16467960	That's so good. What I
16470480	16472480	For goodness sake, I'll get Santa my
16474760	16476760	At least he well in this house
16478240	16482260	Like I do feel bad when like people have a streamer that maybe like struggles to stream
16483400	16486240	And I just find they're like a really good time poke it down
16487880	16491200	Is that a multiplayer character it kind of looks like it might actually be
16492960	16496400	If it is then that's like another
16497160	16502200	Complement to the game would be in like how they incorporated multiplayer characters into the game
16502840	16504840	campaign between
16505840	16507840	Drowning is standing
16510360	16512360	Did you ever play the multiplayer for this game I
16514080	16516080	Don't
16517440	16518680	I
16518680	16523480	Think I was aware of it 56% okay hold on. I'm starting to have hope
16525280	16528280	I'm starting to have mild hope. I don't want to get anyone
16529560	16531240	I
16531240	16533240	Don't want to lead to anyone on
16534160	16541000	But it might be possible it might be for the hundred percent run
16543640	16548640	Because that's going up way faster now that we're just sorry I should be re-riding horse right now and
16549960	16555480	Because that like literally I was so confused why like the percentage was so low okay
16556480	16564200	So let's let's see what happens. Let's see. We're at 55 percent. I believe I've gone
16568200	16571240	Oh, I remember this one is that stupid
16572920	16576640	You go all the way around in order to oh, actually I'm gonna send off assassin recruits
16577120	16580640	Need to level them up and we need money money money for tourist attractions
16581480	16583480	I
16584040	16586040	Know I know
16586200	16590120	Knowing that a streamer you like is on most of the days I got time from yours
16590880	16594920	Yeah, like I don't really get born out like I'm happy to talk about it, but like I
16596920	16604480	Just don't seem to experience like so don't get me wrong. I absolutely can have days where I am
16605240	16611280	Like ready to go to bed, but like I wake up on the other side of bed, and I'm like
16612560	16615360	What we doing like let's go do this. Let's go do that. Um
16618240	16620480	Send them off for 200 type thing
16620920	16625840	But like actual burnout like I always wake up the next day like wanting to do something more
16625840	16628920	Oh, there's actually a contract right here. We is that inside?
16629680	16631680	Oh
16634560	16640200	It's fantastic there. Hello, Madame Madonna Madonna
16642600	16648320	The pigeons deliver the names of key paper agents the Jubilee has brought the hard part will be the last 5%
16649520	16651520	Exchange for up solution
16651520	16657160	Threats of damnation terrorized those reluctant to pay the agents collections go directly to Chaldery
16657360	16659640	I will make money the least of their worries
16663600	16665600	What's the hundred percent
16667600	16669600	New assassin contracts a lot
16670920	16674680	Say no more my lady. Say no more
16677440	16678880	Okay
16678880	16684800	Let me get up. Okay. We've got more assassin contract, which means the percentage will get even higher very shortly
16687760	16689760	Send away my assassins to level up and
16691920	16696080	Well, pardon me, excuse me come through my ladies. Would you like to distract those?
16699280	16705600	More ladies would you like to come and distract some
16708680	16712800	There's any guards ahead unfortunately, I'm on a horse so much faster than them
16713440	16717040	And the horse is stuck on the hill. That's the only thing I don't like with a game
16718120	16722360	Right, uh, there's no guard. So we're just gonna we'll be fine. It's okay
16723680	16728600	Where's this guy? I'm on the wrong side. Hello. Oh, there you are
16728600	16730600	Oh
16739760	16741760	What are these contracts doing
16747040	16751760	Just one shooter it will be easy to overtake cannot be very accurate
16752600	16754600	Oh
16760160	16762160	He's swinging a huge person and
16763520	16766880	Kill the target using the head and bleed within 45 seconds
16768160	16770400	Don't like change both try it
16775520	16778920	45 seconds run run run run run run run right he's gonna close that. Okay
16782360	16784620	Okay?
16784620	16786580	Okay?
16786580	16788200	45 seconds hidden bleat.
16788200	16791580	45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat.
16791580	16794180	45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat,
16794180	16795940	45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat,
16795940	16800020	45 seconds hidden bleat, 45 seconds hidden bleat,
16800020	16803360	hidden bleat, hidden bleat, I love hurting people
16803360	16805780	with a hidden bleed, okay we did it.
16805780	16817260	Oh. His name is Laquac. Okay, we did it. What's your take on the best AC game regarding
16817260	16827580	story-wise? Exio's story-wise? Like, all of Exio? Uh, like, especially Revelations, when...
16827580	16832700	Whoa, why am I under attack? What's going on? Give me a run. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where
16832700	16843420	did you even come from? I didn't want to hurt anyone, though, as you're doing. I saw that,
16843420	16847620	so I'm gonna grab it. I didn't even know where those guys came from. They're no
16847620	16850180	stationed here, right?
16850980	16856380	Oh. I'm not having a good one around. Hmm.
16858380	16864780	You know if we're part of these, Exio's killing a lot of the multiplayer characters. Yes! Definitely.
16864780	16870460	We'll go get this assassin contract. Well, can I just spin around the map again, like,
16870460	16876180	how we did when we were renovating everything? Spin around the map. Why is he
16876180	16882860	whispering in Italian to a French? I don't even know how you'd say rest in peace in
16882860	16896100	French. Dormez-vous! Dormez-vous, mate. So, la-vous. C'est n'est pas la vie? No, no, it's not the life
16896100	16905260	anymore. My French is awful. I get very confused with how they structure, like, words in French.
16905300	16910020	It's true. It's true. Do you ever think about if Exio was really here to be an insane serial
16910020	16914020	killer and probably the highest kill- Oh, yeah. Actually, who does have the highest kill count?
16914020	16928020	Oh! Don't answer that, actually. Yeah. Not necessary. Thank you, guys. Hmm. I'm gonna grab
16928020	16934820	this flag right now. Yeah, no. I, like, I asked the question, and my brain then flashed up
16934820	16944820	that answer, and I was like, ah, hmm, hmm. Like, I've run out of this. Uh, nah, we're just meming
16944820	16950780	along. We're not really talking about much. I've discovered why my percentage was going up so slow,
16950780	16957260	so we're currently in the question mark stage of, is this gonna be a 12-hour marathon to 100%
16957260	16969140	the game or not? Because I couldn't figure out why the frickin' game. Oh, we need... Okay, you guys
16969140	16975100	are, like, so close to being maxed out. It's crazy. I'm not gonna send you away for 20 minutes, so do
16975100	16985780	you max out? Yes, we do. The other two, we don't even need to send away anymore. More. Do you need,
16985820	16995220	like, 24 minutes? Nah, you need a bit more XP than that. Got a level 82 XP to it for you. Yeah,
16995220	17003340	that looks like quick math. That looks good to me. My brain was still explicit in the context. No, no,
17003340	17009460	I don't need it. Oh, I need to accept the contract. Actually, oh, I'm gonna send the thieves on this
17009540	17019060	person over here, actually. Actually, factually, as long as you set them on someone, you don't
17019060	17022820	actually have to stick around or anything. I'm gonna grab this feather while I'm at it as well,
17022820	17032660	because I'm really close to it. Right, as well. It's also a feather in the coliseum that you go
17033540	17039860	That's 6 out of 10. Wait, why are you guys still following me? Did you not lure the guards?
17042980	17045300	I guess they didn't activate because they weren't close enough.
17050340	17060100	Wait, do you only lure away stationery guards? Can he be? Oh, wow, I did not know that. I thought
17060100	17069140	you could lure anyone, so I have to pick stationery guards? I have not bought the coliseum. I actually
17069140	17082820	might have enough. Right there. Right there, luring him away. I'm gonna go and get this nation. Oh,
17082820	17089540	a maestro. I saw that. I saw that. I need five assassins to be maestro, and then we'll do some
17090100	17100980	more reblet. You just have to be good at the game. I say you're done. Wait, is this funny? I'm coming for you.
17111300	17113700	Right, I'll send them two together, because they're not ready yet.
17114660	17118740	Uh, no, I keep forgetting to accept the fricking contract.
17120580	17126260	Hi, hi, hi. Yes, yes, yes, but you don't need to tell me. Right, what's the mission assignment?
17126260	17133540	Make a nice and easy peasy. Finish the memory within two minutes. Where am I supposed to go?
17133540	17135460	Do I need to go by horse or not? Yes or no?
17144020	17147300	The thing is, you take, like, if you just directly sprint.
17151540	17156180	Yeah, see, this is the problem. All this stuff is in the way in order to get to them in under
17156180	17167060	two minutes. Right, gallop, please. Yeah, okay, okay, faster, faster, faster. Yeah, okay, the horse
17167060	17174180	was definitely the better bet. You could not run that. And just says do it in under two minutes. So
17175780	17181300	yeah, what are you? Oh, they're on horseback. No, that makes fighting so annoying.
17184340	17188820	Oh, sorry, I've got an itchy nose, so if my tracking goes away, it's for my 90s.
17190500	17194420	Okay, okay, so glad I took the fricking horse. Holy crap.
17198020	17206820	Okay, that's it. It's just so easy. It's just so easy. It's so good. Like, I love these
17206820	17212900	missions. Holy crap. I had no idea how easy they were. Oh, excellent. And it's like that.
17214660	17215860	Literally a minute to spare.
17220900	17226660	Another one. Another one. Oh, do you want to come with me? We'll distract some guards.
17227380	17230180	I should be so close to doing the distraction on.
17236740	17242420	Okay, there's a guard over here. Actually, I need to walk around. I might distract.
17244900	17251540	I didn't do anything. May I ask that? Time to perish. Are you ready?
17253300	17255060	Oh, is it because I had the weapon out maybe?
17257780	17263220	Yeah, I literally did not know.
17269780	17274180	So the good thing with the mercenaries, if you walk around with them to the next location,
17274180	17279300	you can keep setting them on new people to attack, so I'm just going to bring them with me.
17279700	17287140	And once they've attacked 10 people, then we have done that section of the mercenaries challenge.
17290740	17295220	Do you think Margaret Thatcher effectively utilised girl power by funneling money into the
17296180	17310980	game? I'm just here to play video games. I'm quite happy to admit that this topic of conversation
17310980	17317940	is completely out of my knowledge realm. No, I've never played it with monsters. I
17317940	17322420	always play vanilla. I prefer to play games vanilla to appreciate the way that the development
17322420	17328180	team made it. A lot of people don't like vanilla Skyrim, and I'm so sorry, but I just enjoy it.
17331300	17340420	I didn't know because I played on Xbox. I didn't know that on vanilla Skyrim because I was on
17340420	17346420	Xbox that the little dots on the floor were daisies and grass until I played on PC for the first time.
17347380	17354660	Oh, oh, oh, is it, am I pooping or is that mud?
17356980	17359620	Why are they insisting on walking into me, honestly?
17366100	17371540	I just tried to watch A.G's stream, A.B's stream, but I'm deaf in my left ear,
17371540	17375780	so it went silent for 10 seconds in my right ear. But you heard that? I'm like, I don't know.
17375780	17379060	Oh, bless you. What happened?
17382820	17385620	Were you born like that or did you get tiniest?
17387700	17391460	Are they still not done with that fight? Oh, the guy went back on his horse. I was actually going
17391460	17398500	to send him on him. Oh, they're still fighting. Come on. It's just one guy in armor.
17398820	17405300	Oh, come on. You can do it. I believe in this.
17407140	17411540	Horses kicking. Literally. I've never, I've never had the horse being pushed into the floor.
17412740	17421380	Come on, mercenaries. Come on. One of the, yeah, there you go. Geez. Right. We're going to set him
17421380	17423380	on this guy now.
17432340	17436580	The Guardia. Oh, they're beating that horse up.
17440900	17445060	I don't know how many mercenary challenges are completed. All their stuff is like
17445060	17449940	weapon based or doing something impressive or winning. We're going to say, do you guys need help?
17452340	17453620	I think they need help with him.
17455620	17461380	Okay. They definitely need help with him. Yeah, from done. Thanks guys. Glad I hired you.
17470660	17473220	Bought some bought things. Taking so long. I know.
17473220	17483060	I've almost done like sending the mercenaries on people at least. Is this like five maybe?
17483860	17489060	If they could just perish them a bit faster, you know, we can be there.
17492100	17495940	Literally, I'm like just hooded man on horse since four men to fight.
17496500	17503780	Ten years working around engine rooms. Oh, no. That's like the quickest way to lose here.
17504500	17506980	It's like works like that. Okay. Maybe not.
17508420	17512500	Why are messages disappeared? Mozio feeling okay? Am I going crazy?
17514340	17516340	Rubber room. I'm rubber room through the rest.
17516340	17526020	Oh, right. We're almost there. We're almost there.
17531700	17532500	Right. Fight him.
17532980	17542180	Fill them off the horse or something.
17548180	17549940	This is going to take forever.
17554420	17558740	Is there like another mercenary group right here? Yeah. Okay. Can I have you?
17559220	17563540	And then can I send you to fight this group that's already fighting?
17564100	17567300	It works. Okay. Now they're completely outnumbered.
17570020	17573060	That must be what? Six now? Only four more to go.
17574580	17578020	I'm born deaf on my left ear. Perfect for sleeping because I sleep on Marisa.
17580660	17587140	Okay. Now, follow me. So this will be seven?
17588820	17590980	Oh, for goodness sake. That's taking forever.
17595140	17600820	I'll do that though. Because it's when you send them, they don't have to win the fight.
17600820	17603460	It's just when you send them on people. Actually, you know what?
17604740	17607380	I'm just checking. I'm just checking. I can't take this anymore.
17609060	17613860	Gale challenges. Mercenary? Nine? Okay.
17614500	17622020	Guards killed Will on horseback. Brutes killed. Scaffolding.
17624020	17629460	Guards on horseback. Ares assassinated? That must be done from a certain location.
17629460	17633300	Yeah, double assassinations. Three out of ten. I can hardly get it done.
17634340	17639860	Court is on. Nine. Oh, guard's poisoned. It's 15, so I do need to go poison a ton more guards.
17640420	17644580	I assume if they hate each other, then I don't care. Okay, thieves on our entrance.
17645300	17651460	Leaves of faith, I need a 20. Guards are assassinated from a mini.
17658100	17668580	I just need to find one enemy. Hello, you are enemy. And fight. Okay, finally. That took so long.
17670260	17674900	Hiring discount earned a little bit. Hello.
17689540	17694340	Man, look at his fresh cut on that beard. Look at that angle. Is that even possible back then?
17694580	17702180	I was really dumb, but like before razors were invented,
17702820	17707620	did guys just like shave their beard on rocks and stuff? Like, I know that sounds really silly,
17707620	17712100	but did they like fashion a rock to be sharp? And then that's how you got rid of your beard?
17712100	17714980	Or did like everyone just have beards back in the old days?
17715940	17717540	The razors weren't a thing.
17719060	17726500	Maybe glass. It was 100%. Kill by air assassination.
17730420	17733940	Sheave with swords. Not like before that kind of thing.
17738900	17742420	Oh, wow, it's such a good far way. Maybe a horse again.
17745620	17753140	I'm tired of thieves. They may be able to keep up. I'm fucking do a lure away the guards.
17753860	17757380	Thank you. We're getting there. We're getting there. We're getting there.
17764340	17770740	I'm getting stuck on a rope. They shave with knives. They just go to homies to scratch their
17770740	17778260	beards off by hand. That sounds painful as anything. Shave with obsidian.
17780420	17781060	Guys still did.
17783380	17788020	Okay, what am I supposed to do here? Oh, air assassination. Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb
17788020	17791140	and see the guys probably up in this building then since it's all red.
17791140	17799060	Hmm. I'm not gonna be discovered, am I? Hello. Goodbye.
17800500	17804660	Actually, I need to start looting bodies because I'm getting low on supplies,
17804660	17806340	because I'm wasting them all.
17806580	17817700	Okay, air assassination.
17819940	17824820	Let's give it a shot. Where is he? Gee, I wonder where it's air assassination.
17824820	17826420	Oh, I just called him a horse doing that.
17831220	17833540	I need to get away. That's why I called him a horse.
17833540	17841460	Gee. I haven't drawn his mug on two monitors as overwhelming.
17841460	17846100	Wait until I make hypnosis. I'm so excited to make my first one. I don't know what to do.
17847940	17852180	I was gonna do a like free thing.
17854180	17857860	God, these missions are so good and easy. I can't get over it.
17858820	17862180	I'm not doing the Naruto. I'll keep doing the Templar Agents
17863620	17865780	because it's starting to get like less and less.
17866340	17872340	Copernico is a nightmare. If I remember correctly, Copernico is like throw yourself
17872340	17877300	across the city as fast as you can type missions, which I despise.
17877300	17880340	And like it really does not give you like much time at all.
17880340	17882740	So I'm not looking forward to doing Copernico.
17883940	17886180	No, I don't need the body, but thank you.
17887140	17890260	Hello, horsey. Are you ready?
17891140	17898340	Mount. Mabos. Mabos. Well, the horse, please think of Mabos.
17905300	17908180	Speaking of, are you going to collab with Secret Subject?
17908180	17911620	I haven't reached out yet. I know Secret is like super busy.
17912260	17917060	Like she's got like the new VTuber model and everything going on.
17917700	17923220	And I don't want to be like a bother, like harassing anyone.
17926900	17931220	I might get the boss to reach out, but at the moment, like I've actually got quite a lot of
17931220	17938420	people that are interested in collabs with me. And I'm going to try and like not take too much
17938500	17944420	time. Like I say, she says that she plays on stream for 12 hours and literally has like folk
17944420	17948660	waiting on her right in the script. So it can be sent off. Well, that was.
17952100	17958260	But I don't want to send you away. Can I send?
17960660	17963220	I'm so sorry. I think I need a drawing.
17963220	17968740	I think it's time. The problem
17972180	17977380	is that I take like five minutes to generate one. I really don't want to go.
17980260	17987460	I know it didn't happen yesterday, which I'm really happy about, but I think it's happening.
17987460	17993380	Oh, wait. Sorry. Oh, sorry. I need to go into an emergency meeting with one of the girls over
17993380	18001860	something. But I'm like 90% sure I can feel my organs shifting around.
18003940	18011300	I have no coin on my corpse. I can hear them behind me. That's actually pretty scary. No.
18012180	18019540	Oh, no, no, no. I mean, doing this, I will take advantage of the smoke because we need to kill
18019540	18023140	enemies in smoke.
18032260	18037060	Right, they can all just fight each other. Oh, I need to go through the most.
18037220	18041540	Any idea when the first hit in the stream, I'll do my job.
18044420	18050660	It's time is my biggest problem. Like if we end up doing that 100%, I don't know if it's possible.
18052020	18058340	Then I probably won't do it tonight. Needy streamer. I need to go out and buy American
18058340	18062900	sweets for this hand cam stream and clean up my desk because it's an absolute mess.
18063380	18066820	And get like a nice cute outfit and all that.
18069380	18076020	It's just time, honestly. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm not interested in making it. It's just
18076020	18080420	time. I've got these Ace Mark gloves and girls are waiting on me. And then I'm sending away
18080420	18085060	shorts of the girls to be made to Clippers because I didn't want them being stressed out,
18085060	18094260	having to organize this stuff. I guess it's just trying to settle in right now,
18095140	18102180	but I hope to have some consistent stuff. That's free to access. I do want at least
18102180	18109300	something decent free to access on the alt because I don't think it's fair, especially for
18110420	18114980	people that just simply don't have the money. I completely understand. Don't ever feel bad
18114980	18119060	if you're unable to just straight up give money to streamers or anything like that.
18119060	18126100	Like any of the viewers. I am 100% can say right now that all the girls feel the exact
18126100	18131060	same way as me. If you can't afford it, please don't feel bad. Literally watching,
18131060	18136500	liking, commenting, flipping if you want, liking a tweet. All of this stuff is free to do.
18137140	18146020	Like that helps us beyond words. So don't ever feel inclined and like thank you for
18146020	18150580	respecting that there like is a paywall and some of the content because obviously the girls need
18150580	18157220	to eat and they need to thrive because if they don't like thrive monetary wise, then obviously
18157220	18163300	they're not going to stick around a veiler. Why would you? So like I do appreciate everyone's
18163300	18171140	like complete understanding around it. Um right, where's the source? I am actually
18171140	18182900	unironically stuck. Where the heck am I going? Over the bridge? Over the bridge? Over the broken
18182900	18191540	breed? The girls are doing great. Don't worry. No, not over the broken bridge. Don't be fooled by
18191540	18198660	the map. It's not that old. How do I get down though? I always have that problem whenever I come
18198660	18207060	up to this section. You have to like all of your breath around. We're already lucky and spoiled
18207060	18212180	with what you've done for us already. No need to rush, yeah. Like I know some folk are noticing
18212180	18219940	like oh all the girls aren't posting anymore and it was like yeah the girls are live streaming now
18219940	18225620	they're preparing for streams. They're thinking ahead like they got stuff to do now. Before the
18225620	18232820	only stuff the girls could do was meme in the discord with each other and muck about on twitter
18232820	18239540	and pre-record audios you know and now they've got so much to deal with and contend with so yeah.
18241780	18247540	What am I doing? What am I doing before I mess up? Kill your target? Why is this game so good?
18248260	18254740	These game missions are so good. It's actually making me angry. I have nice
18254740	18261700	interfaces. No, I do understand that some people like complain to complain. That's okay. That's
18261700	18267140	just how some people are. Like it's how they like get you know like stressed out. It's therapeutic
18267140	18279940	to kind of have a mooper whatever. It's a lady killer. Okay I need to chase. Stop chasing me.
18280660	18288660	No you like it you little rascal. You're teasing me. You're a leaky. I don't know what that means.
18288660	18297780	They didn't put the subtitles in. Stop it. I love a good glitch. I love a good glitch.
18297780	18306900	I love a good glitch and that helps me get the objective. I love that. That was good. Just do
18306900	18316820	that again. Honestly renaissance outfit starting to grow in me. It's kind of renaissance influence
18316820	18331140	outfit maybe. Someone suggested a design which was uh was it an aristocrat? Vampire?
18332900	18342340	No it was a smug aristocrat. I'm very like posh hoity toyy looking. The only problem is they
18342340	18347700	would have to be brish because if there were any other I was about to say if there were any other
18347700	18354100	gender it doesn't work. If there were no brish I was like oh Christina available. Wait what's her DNA
18354100	18367060	if Christina is available? I'm not questioning it. To Christina we go. Any other gender than
18367060	18374180	brish? Well that child was like okay thanks brain. Strony. Yesterday don't follow lady who
18374180	18380980	and also me. No no no no I like that. It's a lady assassin though. Only I am allowed to
18380980	18388900	raise lady assassins. Okay I'm coming Christina because I have no idea what the heck that you're
18388900	18395620	freaking storyline is. All right I need you guys because you guys I need to lure away guards with
18398660	18405060	can I technically get you guys to- well why am I- right I guess not. There should be some guards
18405060	18409780	coming up. Good they can run fast they're keeping up with a horse practical.
18409780	18413460	Thank you.
18413460	18417780	Lure them away.
18417780	18423460	Aristocrat with a Jordy axe.
18423460	18429940	Wait how is this all spun about when it comes to the section of the map it's terrible.
18432900	18434820	I think it's on the side.
18434900	18438820	Stuck their anger.
18450820	18454820	Goodness me. I just can't even get this right.
18454820	18456820	I cannot have gone there on you.
18456820	18462820	From the rang way? You rang? You're the one that's now- oh excuse me you're in my way.
18462820	18466340	I could have sworn there's a cape that makes guards ignore you unless you like
18466340	18470660	straight up attack them. I need to put them to that. I don't know what cape that is.
18476020	18478820	Oh wow I think that's five one two.
18486980	18491460	I'm just gonna send them away for money because I think we actually might have enough now.
18493460	18499700	For- for what? For buying everything yet.
18501540	18509060	Right Christina my love thank you for unlocking because we were genuinely also confused on what
18509060	18517220	a bizarre ending your storyline had because that didn't make any sense and you know it didn't so what
18517220	18522660	on earth are we busy? Oh no.
18527220	18529220	Oh no I think we're going to the fair.
18532900	18538980	Do you get an EC mod for your pretty extreme? Maybe put like an assassin screen hood on me.
18539380	18546820	So there's gonna be an assassin screen. I've never thought about that. Maybe I should get
18546820	18553300	Ezio's outfit and like- but like you know get the- get like red lacy underwear and stuff.
18557540	18559540	Leonardo.
18569540	18574580	Perhaps it would have been better not to tell you. She's with her husband. She may not be too happy to see you.
18575380	18581540	No it's wonderful. It's carnival. With these masks she will not even know it's me.
18582180	18584740	I know just the way to draw her attention.
18585060	18591540	Oh he's not over her. He's heartbroken.
18594500	18595540	That's so sad.
18598260	18605540	I can't remember what we have to do here though. Oh there she is. I'm to tail her.
18605940	18614820	There she is with her other hussies.
18623940	18625780	I'm just so interested in these masks.
18628260	18632180	She just got to circle? Wait what was it? Am I supposed to do something?
18632180	18639860	Oh plan a letter on her. I beg your pardon. I was like why did she just go on a circle?
18646180	18650500	Okay that makes much more sense. Way more sense.
18653940	18658100	Okay the rendezvous. Don't mind me.
18663060	18664420	Wait she reciprocates.
18664420	18666420	Um
18678500	18682420	It's you that's wrong. This is it's you.
18682420	18684420	Oh
18700500	18704420	It's been eight years? I was afraid you wouldn't come if I just asked.
18713300	18718900	It was the right thing to do. We loved you. Who cares what he wanted? I love you.
18721700	18725620	You had your second child. Please that's it.
18726900	18735060	It got worse. Why did we do this? Why did we play that memory? It got worse. Is that where it ends?
18735620	18743460	That was even worse. Why did we go away? Why did we go further? There has to be another one. There's
18743460	18753060	no way. It got so much worse. That was terrible.
18753700	18755700	Oh
18762660	18769620	Shot through the heart. True. That got even. I don't know why. Like I don't know why I thought
18769620	18774580	that memory would like oh that's gonna be so much better than the last one. No.
18776820	18780020	No no no no no. That's terrible.
18780420	18789300	Well she said don't find her again but I'm left unsatisfied. I feel like that's such a short
18789300	18796820	memory that's not like the true ending. Right we're gonna upgrade our assassins just because
18800420	18809140	we have the thing. I'm not bothered about the thieves honestly. I have quite a lot of money though.
18810340	18816740	Good on Christina for not being a cheater. Literally like when
18818500	18823940	when she was like oh husband's name. I was like wait Etsy planted the lair and like
18825940	18830980	ah what a mess Etsy. What a mess you've got yourself into in a pickle.
18833220	18836180	Yeah he sucks when it comes to romance. Like everything is permitted.
18840900	18842900	Goodness gravy.
18857380	18861380	Welcome to the Brotherhood. Yes.
18865620	18866740	Did I get the thing?
18870020	18876340	Hmm. Suspend points.
18879300	18881300	Assassins Guild challenges complete. Okay.
18884020	18888820	Uh oh Guild crest stop. Is there something new around here?
18889220	18900420	This? We get little things. We get trinkets. Oh my god this game. I'm sorry this game was
18900420	18905780	made for girls. You're telling me. I get a little sim and I get to put it in my little house. My
18905780	18913380	little assassin house. Okay sorry I love this game so much. How did it know? How did it know I was a
18913380	18917620	girl? Good night. Rest well. See you in the morning.
18921140	18923540	Gender norms go hands my goodness.
18925220	18929860	Ah right I don't really want to start Copernicus. We'll go buy the Pantheon.
18934900	18939140	We'll go buy this because we literally do have a I'll check the bank in case any interest is made.
18940020	18947860	Accessories clear. I can't believe it. I can't believe I get to decorate those assassins freaking
18947860	18956420	hideout with my guild crests for all my hard work. Ah. We know the target audience. Honestly
18957060	18963140	is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a girls game? The only reason I say that is because it's like
18963140	18971140	such a good game. Like it doesn't it's like so hard to get like genuinely to get stuck in like
18971140	18978740	at any part is next to impossible. Oh I need poison guards actually.
18981380	18986580	I'm just gonna like muck about and I don't want to poison like anyone in front but I think they
18986580	18990820	need to like pass away from poison or it doesn't count because I'm pretty sure of poison quite a
18990900	19002020	lot now. Game's so good it breaks the gender barrier. Why is this one so goofy looking honestly?
19006740	19012180	Wait are you saying if it's easy to make friends? I mean I don't know. I feel like whenever I see
19012180	19019220	like a guy review a game it's always like I love the challenge of this game. I love having to repeat
19019220	19027460	the same thing like 12 times over until I got like unspanked and like I figured it out and I'm
19027460	19032660	like I just want to chill experience like make it through the story mode and have a good time
19034020	19039300	and like yeah I'm just a bad gamer that wants indie games.
19042900	19046820	Not a free game journal. I feel like Brotherhood is such a great game that boys angry.
19050180	19053220	My little cousin played it after watching me play it so there it is.
19059540	19064500	Then you gotta love Dark Souls. I mean it's basically what you- no Dark Souls is the opposite
19064500	19072020	of what I described and I know for a factoid it is because I have had the pleasure of playing
19072020	19077300	Elden Ring with the Reeflings and the truth you want the truth I don't think you can handle the
19077300	19084020	truth. I would not have been able to complete that game on my own like I just don't see how
19084020	19090900	I could have done it without all the help of the Reeflings. That's the truth you think you can handle
19090900	19106180	the truth. I'll just poison them one at a time. I think I need to wait until they expire as well
19106180	19113060	which is the biggest problem. You're just like your hand being held didn't you? What do you mean
19113060	19117860	that like all these people are being so nice to me and helping me through my game and I get to
19117860	19124100	reward them? Maybe I should do that like every time we do like a game where you guys hold my
19124100	19129860	hands like I do a reward audio for it and then like my set like when I'm you know doing the
19129860	19134660	ending part of the reward I'm like thank you for helping me thank you for helping me thank you
19134660	19141220	for over me and then then I pop. You know that's terrible I know.
19146020	19147540	Can you poison on horseback?
19152100	19156020	It says shoot. No you can't poison on horseback.
19164820	19170020	Spank in that horse jeez. I'm not gonna hang around until I need him to expire.
19174900	19181620	I wouldn't be opposed. Wait we played what? Uh Elden Ring. Elden Ring's a really good game to
19181620	19194180	carry. I think I want to carry you. It's a beautiful stream and strong ease so dumb to play.
19196100	19198980	Hey streamer I think I want to carry you.
19199300	19213460	They're all looking in opposite directions so I can maybe do two.
19216500	19220340	I can maybe do three if I get this guy. Oh no I can't they're both.
19221140	19225620	He does his hands. They'd be amazing.
19227380	19232100	Games should have some challenge though. Yeah no I do agree there definitely should be like
19232100	19236100	some consequence or else if you don't feel like any pressure to do anything then you
19236100	19241220	don't enjoy the game like it's really hard to nail what kind of dynamic that you wanted.
19242340	19248660	Like oh I'm in trouble I'm sorry. I am a naughty assassin. I didn't hate well enough.
19249380	19254660	Unless don't don't don't. Oh don't push me. Get poisoned.
19256660	19259380	Plap plap plap. Get poison get poison poison.
19262260	19268820	Everyone's getting poisoned around here. Oh please spin that pole around. There we go.
19268820	19273940	Okay I managed to replenish a ton of poisons which is good because oh hello.
19274660	19279060	You're going in the well for thieving from me. Goodbye.
19282740	19291300	Um you can come out now. It's okay I'll come get you. I did not mean to do that. I don't think
19291300	19297140	his life should have been forfeit but I mean was it kind of deserved? I don't know.
19297540	19303460	Everything that was a bit morbid I'd say I'm gonna be honest I actually didn't expect that.
19305060	19309460	Please mummy don't poison my iron brew. Have a can iron brew in the fridge.
19312660	19318660	Right it ages ago and I'm still not sipped up. I need like the perfect meal. I miss
19318660	19327460	British fish and chips so much. I'm sorry to any Aussies listening. Your fish and chips are rank.
19334820	19337460	Okay I did the courtesan. Can I poison?
19338020	19349620	Can I like poison all you guys and then push it all away so you don't do that fighting thing?
19350660	19354900	I hate when they do the fighting thing. I think if they like hit each other with
19354900	19359460	the swords it doesn't count as poison so I'm gonna try and separate them. Oh he just did it there.
19359460	19369220	No I tried. I don't want to leave the vicinity too quickly for the poison but something.
19370900	19376820	Hey I'm not gonna find it with fish and chips around here. Yeah Aussies use shark and like I think
19376820	19382340	it's called gummy shark. It's not actual shark meat it's just a fish.
19383300	19394500	How do you call Germans Scottish? Oh there we go we did the poison gourd. Rank five courtesan.
19396820	19409860	Did I say courtesans poison people now? Ladies. Am I in Australia forever? I highly doubt it.
19409860	19418020	It's very good to run a business from Australia compared to the United Kingdom but oh no you're
19418020	19427460	saying get down to me but not to this wife over here. What's he gonna say? No are you doing me?
19428340	19433780	Um yeah it's good to run a business in Australia but I can't see myself being here forever.
19433780	19440660	I've fallen from my share of rooftops. I'm waiting for my lance. Up here. He left me after our baby died.
19441700	19447460	Joined up with the Chento of Keegan. They say he kills now pushes men from buildings.
19448500	19454100	I tell them I don't believe it. The British use haddock is a delicious fish. What will you say when he comes?
19454100	19460580	Are you in Australia? Heck yeah I am. I'm doing uh I'm making a call. My death will remind him of the
19460580	19465940	man he once was. I'm gonna do a VTuber meet and greet in Australia.
19468580	19471460	I did not look at what the hundred percent thing was. Oopsie.
19473140	19481060	Hold her head a guy. You will travel you no more Madonna. Madonna. What's hundred percent?
19481060	19488740	Kill your target with a hidden blade. Why is this mission type so so perfect?
19494500	19501380	So Imburgh was well with fish and chips then. Kind of. I don't know what the best takeaway,
19501380	19508580	maybe unironically a Chinese but like a British Chinese. Oh I think I need to chase this guy
19508820	19513700	from the rooftops. I think yeah. It's giving chase from the rooftops.
19517780	19523780	What do you mean merda? Get bonked. Hidden blade hidden blade. Lock on to him at least.
19523780	19528740	Exhale don't be afraid. Exhale water. Exhale.
19531380	19538260	The only thing I despise is when you have to do like assassin. Can you come here? Yeah? Yeah?
19538260	19543300	Yeah? No. No. No. Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back. Can I knock him off?
19544500	19549700	Why are you trying to hit the ear? You know full well what I'm aiming for it. So like genuinely.
19551540	19558900	Oh goodness sake. Stop moving a bit. Just accept your death. It's over for you buddy.
19560260	19565300	Stop it. I'm actually getting teased. Stop it. There we go. My goodness.
19568340	19574180	My tummy hurt. No more food. No more have you eaten too much. Can't forget.
19576980	19585620	Have you had any encounter with the local fauna? Ah magpies. I have befriended wild magpies. Although
19585620	19593700	I saw my first snake in a cockroach. Oh my god. There's no such thing as cockroaches
19593940	19602420	in Scotland. And I met my first and a possum. Oh my god. Possum are terrifying. I don't like.
19602420	19606660	I thought they were cute. The noise they make at night is like
19610260	19618900	a very scary. Not a fan. Not a fan. Yeah. I had my first cockroach encounter and I'm like I want
19618900	19627780	to go back to Scotland right now. Thank you very much. Because oh my goodness. Possums
19627780	19636260	are harmless if you leave them alone. Yes. I accidentally ran like into one. That sounds
19636260	19644420	really dumb. But my cat escaped the garden and I had to go into my neighbour's garden.
19644420	19650740	And it was one o'clock in the morning and thank goodness I'm no in America because I probably
19650740	19659060	would have got shot on sight. Oh I'm in trouble. And it was absolute nightmare. It was freaking
19660020	19665780	so dark and I had to run around to get into my neighbour's garden and there was a possum that
19665780	19671140	was eye level on the fence. And both of us basically like both me and the possum were like
19676420	19684500	but yeah I had to dive into my neighbour's garden. I'm wondering to throw my cat back over the fence.
19685860	19694020	Yes Gimli. I'm talking about you. Don't do it again. I never want to be in that situation again.
19694020	19699300	I had to stick a letter through the freaking mailbox being like I am so sorry if you heard any
19699300	19705620	of that. Ruckus last night. That was me. No one tried to steal from you. And like I had to sign it
19705620	19713060	with my freaking address and everything. Her name is Gimli. Yes. Because she's Ginger.
19714580	19721780	She's got ginger on her so I named my cat Gimli. So when I pick her up I go that's my wee laugh.
19722180	19724180	Gimli.
19728340	19733940	Excuse me. You said well the thing what it was literally 1am and like they're creak they had the
19733940	19741300	creakiest gate ever and I'm like I'm like Gimli. Gimli get here. Gimli get here right now. Gimli.
19741300	19749860	And because she had never been outside the garden before and she got really confused and was meowing
19749860	19755860	at the door of the neighbor instead of coming back over the fence to me like I had been calling on
19755860	19760260	her for ages and I was trying not to wake up any of the neighborhoods like the neighborhood area.
19760980	19762660	Donut was the man that I met him a long time ago.
19762660	19766260	I was like Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli.
19767140	19772260	Kill only Donut though. Big Donut. Where can I find you?
19773220	19778100	Thank you. Nobody. No, like unironically I had to toss Gimli back in the garden.
19778980	19786740	And yeah she's not here and the music's gonna do the thing.
19789220	19790820	I love the pickup of the music.
19797940	19804980	Oh my god veterinary care though in Australia is so fairly priced and so good.
19808180	19817220	My baby boy he ended up injuring himself on something mysterious and he had a cut on his leg
19818740	19824020	and I phoned up a vet and they were like oh we offer up a pickup service
19825540	19829300	for animals and I'm like well I don't drive so that's perfect thank you.
19830260	19832980	I don't understand how you can do that though.
19833700	19835700	Wait I need to kill all my him.
19837220	19837700	Simple.

19841300	19844820	What? Where are my field workers at?
19848260	19854180	But yeah they phoned up I'm like my baby boy's got a cut on his leg I don't know what happened.
19856820	19860740	Can I book an appointment? I was gonna have to put him in a taxi with me.
19861460	19863540	Wait wait wait just becoming almost.

19937540	19938420	Okay I'm fine.
19938420	19947380	We took a neighborhood cat since you're going to fight in Toro Fathom.
19948500	19955300	Yeah like literally the health, the veterinary care in Australia is so cheap and good.
19955940	19960260	And they were like oh we can like pick up your animal and I'm like oh yes please.
19960260	19966900	And I was expecting like $800 or something and it was like super cheap and they were so nice
19966900	19973780	and like it was so quick into when I adopted him that I was like I'm so sorry I have absolutely
19973780	19978980	no idea what the temperament he's going to be like please be careful he might be aggressive
19978980	19983620	like I don't know how he's going to act and they're like oh he was just like a sweet little angel
19983620	19985300	and I'm like oh thank you I'm so glad.
19987060	19988820	So what happened next with Gimli?
19988820	19996340	Oh well through back over the fence and now she's not allowed outside without me being with her
19996340	20000420	because she's a silly silly sausage and gives me a heart attack.
20005220	20010820	I unfortunately live like on car roads.
20010820	20018180	Actually one thing I'll complain about Australia is residential areas don't like have a speed
20018180	20024260	limit or the speed limit is ridiculously high and I'm not being funny the speed of freaking cars
20024260	20031060	is ridiculous over here it's very Americanized sorry sorry to like be mean and stinky because
20031060	20037140	I should be really thankful like that I even have like the ability to like basically like check out
20037140	20043540	another country and type thing like I should be grateful and all that but it doesn't mean I'm
20043540	20050900	not allowed to complain so I will complain um but I'm trying to think that once hold on.
20051700	20062100	So you did literally what she did was climbed up a tree and jumped over a fence so I basically
20064020	20068980	now she didn't get hurt before anyone's like oh my god you're was it a linear whatever her name
20068980	20076020	was 2.0 or whatever no I put her back on the tree like I like shuggled her back on the tree
20076820	20080500	and then I knew she was back in the garden and then I had to run around and go back in
20081540	20086980	like in a my garden and bring her back into the house and obviously she was on time at like
20086980	20093300	she wasn't not allowed outside for a couple of days after that we know you never helped me yeah
20094180	20101220	oh sit in the chat for me while you go home you go into a car crash listen to she be you're joking

21101100	21120100	very confused, are they going to spot me, wait, what, I love all the bugs in this game,
21121100	21128100	full stop, I just love them all, game, don't be detected, then hmm, why is that man on
21128100	21135100	the roof, how bizarre, wouldn't work, we make you work for victory, oh no, you guys are
21135100	21140100	allowed to win, I wouldn't cheat to do it on the IQ one, but I forget it's a stream where
21140100	21147100	I make the album, where the heck am I supposed to go, I assume I'm allowed to kill folk,
21147100	21156100	I feel like I need seven bolts, am I going crazy where, is he over there, is that him
21156100	21172100	over there, I'm, I'm having a, well, I don't have a choice, yeah I was going to say I don't
21172100	21179100	have a choice, because he was coming into the hay bale anyway, lower score is better right,
21179100	21184100	I'm going to be number one, chat's IQ is room temperature, but that's why we're so good
21184100	21192100	for each other, we're so bad, am I tracking funny with you, I think, oh my tracking is
21192100	21197100	funny, I fucking hate this iPhone, for some reason, sorry that got really aggressive out
21198100	21205100	here, whenever it is horizontal, it does not track me full stop, horizontal, vertical,
21205100	21210100	no, when it's vertical it works, when it's horizontal it doesn't, but I need to charge
21210100	21216100	it while I stream, and it's awkward to put it vertical doesn't it, is my tracking being
21216100	21223100	rubbish all day, I'll just over enunciate my word, though you guys, I don't know where
21223100	21248100	this enemy is, genuinely, I guess I can do this kind of stuff, and loot the bodies, could
21248100	21256100	you get some sort of tool to grip it and hold it in there, oh, so it's on like the world's
21256100	21269100	tiniest tripod which is adorable, I'm so confused, honestly, I don't know where this person is
21269100	21277100	I'm supposed to be trying to find him, I'm going to loot these bodies and hopefully get
21277100	21287100	more supplies, because one poison, one medicine wasn't as cool, please expire so I can loot
21287100	21293100	your body, sorry, okay there we go, to be honest it's hard to tell if the tracking is
21293100	21298100	off or not, since we don't have a reference, alright let me build my webcam let's, where
21298100	21306100	is this overseer, is he like in, is he below the church or something, is he in it, is he
21306100	21320100	the one by the hay bale, he can't be, um, have I been everywhere yet, I don't know, so those
21320100	21327100	were the ones that caught me on the outskirts, is he in the center and that's why, no, what,
21327100	21339100	what, did I just, is he like walking around and I just can't tell, yeah the game's telling
21339100	21350100	me to stay in this section, I'm on podcast unless as long as it's your birthday, love
21350100	21360100	cuteness is smaller they are, the cuter they are, true, I'm, I'm one confuzzled girl,
21360100	21373100	look at that, I think we're just going to have to literally go around the map and clean
21373100	21386100	it up, because this is, use eagerness to differentiate, yeah but I don't know what to tell you, nothing
21386100	21399100	is being highlighted, oh there's guards coming, no they stopped, we're checking the hay bale,
21399100	21415100	they're like, those guards from down there coming closer or no, yeah, we will shoot them
21415100	21421100	with poison, oh like the game keeps telling me but I don't know what to tell you video
21421100	21435100	game, I've literally been to all sections of this map, wait that didn't happen, okay,
21435100	21443100	I hit him that time, I'm going to loot their bodies to get all the supplies, we'll meet
21443100	21458100	them first, closer to the larger area, is your target in the building?
21458100	21466100	more poison there, the one thing that I'll say is a bit funny in this game, NPCs will walk
21466100	21477100	into guards that are like flailing about and it's like bro, hopefully I can get more ammo
21477100	21484100	off these guys and I'm not spending more, I'm getting more poison back which is fine,
21484100	21499100	I'm spending poison, it's good to get poison back but my goodness, okay, so he does just
21499100	21521100	roam the map, okay, all those guards, I don't want to be these things because I stopped,
21521100	21526100	I didn't realize he turned back, I'm very confused with this mission so like I had to find him
21526100	21532100	walking around and there's guards everywhere, I'm going to go on the roof because there's
21532100	21540100	that rotating jewel here, there's, oh maybe a desync if he notices that people are ill
21540100	21553100	with poison, I don't know, beat up the architect, hopefully this gives me a loading point, give
21553100	21574100	me the plans right now, oh yeah, honestly me, that took so long to progress, I do apologize,
21574100	21584100	that must mean painful, right so what happens now, I'm notorious, okay I can deal with that,
21584100	21590100	I've definitely progressed to the next loading screen so again we've not failed 100%, do not
21590100	21597100	get shot while using the bomber, surely I will do this first time when I get on the bomber,
21597100	21602100	surely I will not have any issues at all and I'm not going to be frustrated with this game
21602100	21610100	mode, I'm already preparing for it, can I launch on that, oh it hits you over there, oh sorry,
21610100	21622100	I need to impair sleep right now so don't get caught, now I have the interest, surely
21622100	21641100	absolutely helping copium right, next loading point please, oh I'm at, I'm to not be detected
21641100	21648100	by the two guards that are across from each other, yeah I'm not to be detected by the two
21648100	21657100	point blank guards, I can do this if that citizen doesn't get in the way and then he will be
21657100	21668100	distracted by him, I said he will be distracted by the poisoned guy, can you, oh and now everyone's
21668100	21680100	in the way, get the fuck out of my way, Jesus, I know why they make the minstrels like that
21680100	21687100	but they've made them a little too well, okay they've made them a little too well, okay yeah
21687100	21694100	my tracking is like bugging out because it's horizontal, I despise you, there's no way
21694100	21702100	or maybe it's the iPhone, hold on, let me cook for the thing, I'm trying to see if I can stand up on it
21702100	21706100	so I have my elaborate setup from yesterday because I removed all the cups from my ring
21706100	21724100	look at the mask, when I have the perfect setup, that looks much more, okay and then we'll look
21724100	21731100	for supplies, the per NPCs, I just know we're gonna fail this and I'm gonna be so mad
21731100	21737100	because I don't know what to expect
21745100	21757100	these poison darts for distraction is absolutely gorgeous, these NPCs in my fucking way, not gorgeous
21758100	21765100	okay he's gonna start attacking, I can see the ones coming down the hill
21765100	21777100	I don't know if they're gonna, oh no, oh no they got attracted, I'm just gonna hide in here
21778100	21783100	unleash the archers, you're evening skulls, I'm nervous
21783100	21786100	I don't know what to do here
21790100	21797100	I'm just kind of waiting around, like waiting for the EI to kick in so I don't know what to do now
21797100	21799100	oh yeah, that
21803100	21805100	must have been drinking the good stuff
21808100	21815100	okay, we're just gonna poison them both again, like literally poison darts
21815100	21822100	don't be afraid to lock onto them when they can see us, no it's fine, honestly don't be afraid
21822100	21830100	no, miss, shit, we cannot be missing poison darts, no, next one, use the other guy
21830100	21836100	okay there we are, we're gonna loot these two bodies so we can refill our poison
21836100	21842100	we're taking it nice and slow, should charts start logging every bird, nah
21845100	21850100	okay these are both poisoned, again we're gonna pick up, we're just gonna take it nice and slow
21850100	21859100	you know, we don't need it too fast, just relax, calming, cozy atmosphere
21868100	21874100	but remember, don't get shot when we are in the glider and I know I'm going through these things
21875100	21877100	I'll still finish it anyway but
21880100	21883100	oh yeah, wow, you get a lot more from them, okay I'm quite happy with that
21885100	21890100	she be redirect, oh no, they're all gonna see my terrible gameplay and me getting mad now
21897100	21899100	they're gonna know I'm a terrible gamer
21901100	21905100	nice cozy atmosphere, remember the guys gagging and choking on the background, literally
21905100	21907100	I'm gonna just move a whistle through my teeth there
21911100	21915100	your gameplay isn't terrible, it's rough on the DLC stuff cause like
21916100	21918100	I don't know, there's anyone up here
21923100	21928100	oh my gosh
21929100	21939100	I've just remembered how humongous this is, we have to get up there but we have to go like
21940100	21943100	and do all this dodgy stuff constant back and forth
21944100	21947100	oh no
21948100	21951100	oh no
21952100	21958100	no, he can't see us again, he needs to forget about us like right now
21962100	21964100	he needs to like, okay
21965100	21968100	wow, that was dangerous
21972100	21975100	hold on, I think we'll be in best, get by another guard
21975100	21977100	there's one in there
21978100	21982100	yeah and he's moving out, oh there's two of them, we're investigating the bodies
21983100	21987100	I don't want to go down, I'd rather stay on the walls and go around to this tower stuff
21992100	21997100	oh my goodness, she be caught and bummer self, thank you for the wade
21998100	22002100	how is your stream, are you steaming, please drink water

22051100	22052100	hi Emmy
22053100	22057100	hope you both enjoyed your stream, hope you enjoyed your stream
22057100	22062100	we are currently doing Leonardo's missions
22063100	22068100	and I'm currently debating if I'm actually capable of 100% in this game
22069100	22076100	unfortunately my answer is, it might be a no, I don't actually think I have the thingy
22077100	22079100	just guarantee the vods getting nuked, okay
22080100	22082100	guys, I'm trying to get you monetized on YouTube
22083100	22085100	right, I can get him in time, fine
22086100	22088100	him, I need this archer over here done, yeah
22089100	22090100	okay, I'm glad that looks
22091100	22092100	that's good
22092100	22093100	is that a flag over there?
22094100	22095100	I don't know, maybe just a treasure
22097100	22100100	sorry, it's fine, I'm teasing, you guys can do what you want
22103100	22105100	I need to go there?
22105100	22106100	what?
22108100	22110100	oh goodness me
22110100	22112100	what is that?
22114100	22118100	I actually think I want that guard to forget I exist
22122100	22124100	she seems so worn out, it's fine
22125100	22128100	we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood 2
22129100	22131100	which is a very beloved childhood game of mine
22132100	22138100	I believe Mercy is coming online in 1, 2, 3 hours, just under 3 hours
22138100	22145100	so if you are a snippet, you are welcome to hang about till it's Mercy time
22148100	22151100	that's very, oh that guy up there, I don't like him
22154100	22158100	I think I'm gonna have to start looting bodies as well because I'm running low on ammo
22169100	22175100	so that was actually rather cute
22176100	22178100	oh what a post to be left in
22179100	22181100	POV, you're a harem
22182100	22185100	that's the position she be gonna leave you in at the end of the night
22188100	22190100	yep, no bod, it's already dead
22194100	22196100	wait, it already got a warning?
22196100	22197100	that was pretty quick
22199100	22202100	that was pretty rough, Jesus
22202100	22205100	I private it over for you, ah, I should have gone
22207100	22209100	let's see, let's do poison
22213100	22215100	oh let's not do poison again
22220100	22223100	she be making a smart move, 5 head now
22224100	22227100	this is so sad, I'm only good to see half of it
22228100	22231100	there's always more ASMR streams to come in the future, don't worry
22232100	22233100	it's not one and done
22234100	22236100	we ain't one and done around these parts
22237100	22239100	hopefully YouTube gets her stuff messed
22240100	22243100	there's a few things going on with YouTube right now
22245100	22247100	this is a very slow based mission by the way
22247100	22249100	because every time we poison, I have to wait until they're perished
22249100	22252100	and then I have to loot them and then I have to go for the next part
22252100	22254100	I don't know if I can reach him from here
22256100	22258100	just out of sight, but I need him gone
22261100	22263100	I need him gone or I can't be jumping around this tower
22265100	22268100	he's got a range of these guys, but I'm not with him
22268100	22270100	Strani, you're always streaming, are you okay?
22270100	22272100	ah, yeah, it's called
22273100	22276100	I am sharing my childhood games and I love them
22276100	22278100	and I want to share them
22279100	22281100	it's a bit more cozy the day yesterday
22281100	22283100	I was a bit, can he see me?
22286100	22287100	he can
22288100	22289100	man needs glasses
22290100	22292100	I mean, whoever will literally leave you up
22292100	22293100	true
22297100	22299100	lovely, lovely stuff
22302100	22305100	we will be taking this very easy
22308100	22312100	I am not sure how to get down
22316100	22320100	out of safety, we're going to be doing a lot of poison right now
22322100	22325100	I don't know if I can leap from there to that
22325100	22327100	and I don't want to risk it
22327100	22329100	that looks like a leap over, definitely
22329100	22331100	like that 100% looks like a leap over
22334100	22336100	they're currently poisoned below me
22336100	22338100	but I should be safe to make my
22340100	22342100	there's a lot of red there
22342100	22345100	I think this is definitely what I'm supposed to do though
22347100	22350100	a 12 and a 6 hour plus stream on your first week is awe inspiring
22350100	22352100	I just really enjoy these video games
22352100	22354100	I definitely will be focusing
22354100	22358100	please don't think my streams are all going to be 18 hours
22358100	22360100	tomorrow's needy streamer overload
22360100	22363100	I've never played it before, but it's definitely going to be a shorter stream
22364100	22367100	because I don't even know if I like it
22367100	22370100	and whenever I have the
22372100	22374100	what happens if I spin around
22375100	22376100	a beam
22377100	22378100	and a
22380100	22382100	neat poison, these two down here
22382100	22383100	not risking it
22386100	22388100	not risking it at all
22388100	22390100	we have come too far
22391100	22393100	right onto the beam
22395100	22397100	I'm just going poison route
22397100	22400100	because poison stops them from being able to see me
22406100	22408100	I'm going to loot this guy's body
22408100	22411100	because archers normally have a lot more stuff on them
22413100	22415100	cuttlefish are venomous
22415100	22417100	there is one cuttlefish that's venomous
22417100	22419100	but my ink isn't venomous
22419100	22421100	it's an aphrodisiac
22423100	22426100	it puts you under my alluring spell
22429100	22431100	what is bro doing with poison though
22433100	22435100	the lead artist for needy streamer overload
22435100	22436100	is one of my favorite artists
22436100	22438100	I'm a sucker for
22438100	22440100	oh his son
22440100	22441100	she booties
22441100	22442100	stuff
22442100	22445100	right we need to be super careful
22445100	22447100	because this is the most ridiculous
22447100	22450100	thing for trying to spot enemies
22450100	22453100	there's like guys all the way up this tower
22453100	22456100	and it's so hard to know when one's about to see you
22456100	22459100	and I'm not freaking redoing this all over again
22460100	22462100	but I'm getting scared
22462100	22464100	okay I can see one guy up there
22464100	22466100	it must be they're all on the roof
22468100	22470100	under your lure
22470100	22472100	not your resa...
22472100	22474100	you might have a streaming edition
22474100	22476100	I can't believe it
22477100	22479100	oh almost fell there
22481100	22484100	you said you might not be able to 100% it
22486100	22489100	there's a few 100%
22489100	22492100	that I genuinely don't know
22493100	22495100	and I'm worried about
22495100	22497100	not being able to do my
22497100	22499100	like I just simply cannot do it
22499100	22501100	and I can't like call
22501100	22503100	I can't tap one of you guys into the game to do it for me
22504100	22506100	so I'm still
22506100	22509100	I'm still not sure this is going to be a 12 hour stream or not
22510100	22512100	I can hear the music
22514100	22516100	how am I supposed to hurt them all at once
22516100	22518100	I don't think I...
22523100	22525100	is that a flag this way?
22526100	22529100	no what? the sun's getting further away
22530100	22532100	uh...
22532100	22534100	why?
22535100	22537100	what am I supposed to do?
22537100	22539100	no!
22541100	22542100	okay
22542100	22544100	okay
22544100	22546100	I understand
22546100	22549100	I thought I was about to be exposed right at the end there
22549100	22550100	right
22550100	22552100	in order to 100% this mission
22553100	22556100	do not get shot while using the bomber
22556100	22557100	okay
22557100	22560100	we have been at this mission for like 20 minutes now
22560100	22563100	all I have to do is nail this off the bat
22563100	22566100	and I don't even remember freakin' doing this
22568100	22570100	I'm going to start sweating
22572100	22574100	okay
22577100	22580100	don't get shot using the bomber
22581100	22584100	why can we not get like a little tutorial first?
22584100	22585100	destroy the workshops
22585100	22586100	I can do that
22586100	22587100	I can do that
22587100	22588100	it's fine
22588100	22589100	tactical camera
22589100	22590100	no not tactical
22590100	22591100	that was awful
22591100	22593100	don't ever do that again
22594100	22596100	press retreat to fire
22596100	22597100	R2
22597100	22598100	oh no
22598100	22599100	oh my god I'm going down
22599100	22600100	this is not good
22600100	22601100	this is not good
22601100	22603100	oh my god I don't know the controls
22603100	22605100	I don't know the controls
22605100	22608100	oh I don't know where the closest one on the map is
22609100	22611100	it's the one...
22612100	22613100	if I take her right
22613100	22614100	I don't think I'm gonna make it
22614100	22616100	just go for the one that I'm hitting at
22616100	22618100	oh my god there's archer towers
22618100	22621100	no no no no no no no no no
22629100	22631100	how?
22632100	22633100	how?
22633100	22636100	how were you not supposed to get hit by that?
22636100	22638100	oh I didn't even hit that tower
22639100	22641100	yeah see this is what I'm afraid of
22641100	22643100	I can't 100%
22643100	22647100	I'm under the impression I now have to redo this entire
22647100	22649100	entire mission again
22649100	22651100	I missed that again?
22653100	22654100	I'm trying so hard
22654100	22657100	I think I'm gonna have to like go further away
22657100	22659100	I don't think there's a checkpoint
22659100	22661100	I never gave an indication
22661100	22663100	wait for one
22665100	22667100	okay there we go
22667100	22668100	shoot workshop twi-
22668100	22670100	whoa whoa whoa my controller Jesus
22671100	22673100	oh please my goodness
22673100	22675100	I almost didn't make it there
22675100	22677100	alright do that
22678100	22680100	okay then do this
22681100	22683100	and I missed so that's okay
22683100	22685100	we just need to do it
22685100	22686100	go around a bit
22686100	22688100	oh well maybe we're gonna just straight up attack this one
22690100	22691100	I missed
22696100	22698100	hopefully there is checkpoints
22698100	22701100	cause this that does seem very harsh
22701100	22703100	I completely I did
22703100	22705100	I will admit I twided off
22705100	22707100	I need a fire like right now
22708100	22710100	oh goodness me
22710100	22712100	goodness gravy
22712100	22714100	they didn't even make this game easy
22716100	22718100	there we go destroyed that one
22719100	22722100	honestly this section was a lot harder on paper
22722100	22724100	I think
22725100	22727100	there
22727100	22729100	right now what?
22732100	22734100	only if you die you have to repeat whole missions
22738100	22740100	a checkpoint at the start of the bomb
22740100	22742100	destroy the bomber
22742100	22744100	where I see
22744100	22746100	speed run over there
22748100	22749100	can we aimbot it?
22749100	22750100	three two one
22750100	22752100	oh I think that was a miss
22752100	22754100	a swing and a miss
22754100	22755100	swing and a miss
22755100	22757100	hold on let's try again
22759100	22760100	oh wow
22760100	22762100	I cannot control this right now
22762100	22764100	I'm completely looking in the wrong direction
22766100	22767100	I
22767100	22769100	bruv

22782100	22784100	okay okay it's okay it's okay
22784100	22787100	I'm just trying to set a fire along the way

22789100	22791100	respond please
22791100	22793100	I missed and it's okay

22807100	22808100	relax
22808100	22809100	relax
22809100	22810100	game
22810100	22812100	what on air I thought I don't think
22812100	22814180	whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
22814180	22816180	whoa whoa whoa whoa
22816180	22817220	bruv部
22818100	22819100	game
22819100	22821100	what was that velocity
22821100	22823100	it was completely unnecessary are you sure
22823100	22824100	game
22824100	22825100	put me up
22825100	22827100	put me up put me up put me up
22827100	22829100	I went ups so I can aim
22830100	22831100	a miss
22831100	22832100	oh wow
22832100	22834100	I actually hit that
22834100	22836100	wow
22836100	22838100	that was crazy
22838100	22840340	I don't think I was supposed to fly that high that was
22843220	22845220	Oops played out of order
22845940	22847940	Where's this a horse? Okay?
22848420	22850420	turn around
22850740	22854980	Every now and then I get this. Oh, I was too early. Hmm. Maybe there then
22855860	22857140	Yes
22857140	22859380	Yeah, okay. That wasn't bad. That wasn't horrific
22861620	22863620	Wow
22864500	22869060	That was a crazy boost. I don't think I was supposed to go that high. I think the game mathematics
22869700	22871700	It's weird
22875700	22877700	Okay
22879540	22883380	There's cool guys don't look at back at explosion
22884900	22886900	Well, we did it
22886900	22888900	That was not easy. That was not fast
22889060	22893940	I am going to open it up in the dna sequence to see if it's like replay that section
22894500	22898420	If it is then a hundred percent, it's still on board if it's not then a hundred percent
22898420	22901140	It's like a much less likely because this is getting hard
22902340	22904340	This is getting tricky
22905300	22907300	It's tricky tricky tricky tricky
22908340	22911460	Rock around rock around just right on time. It's tricky
22919540	22930900	The whole thing I was worried it would say that
22933620	22936020	I was so worried it was gonna say that
22944020	22946020	Look we'll do what we can
22946020	22951060	We'll finish the other like Leonardo missions and that
22952580	22955940	But yeah, this is gonna be I don't
22957300	22964420	That has just like dramatically decreased the odds of being able to a hundred percent it like to go through all of that section
22964980	22969460	Again, like I was taking my time like poisoning guards along the way so I didn't have any issues
22970980	22972260	that
22972260	22976820	That one attempt and we got hit immediately that was the only time we got hit as well
22976900	22980100	Which was just so unlucky because I wasn't sure what the controls were
22981060	22984420	Like that was so rough. I just jumped us. Come on that horse
22986020	22990020	And that is why late game gives more check literally that is so
22991700	22993700	Um punishing
22995060	22997060	Wait, can you a hundred percent this game without being online?
22997460	22999700	Yes, the dna sequence is what we're a hundred percent
22999700	23002980	It's like doing a hundred percent of the memories and stuff. I'm currently
23003940	23006900	63 percent, which isn't bad at all
23007620	23008980	however
23008980	23016260	I was under the assumption the game was a bit more forgiving. However, we've just kind of discovered
23017220	23024660	The replayability checkpoints aren't necessarily all there on certain missions and that is just so
23026180	23028180	I don't know. I don't know
23029860	23031460	Let me see that
23031460	23034420	Okay, go. Yeah. Yeah. Remember trying for
23035140	23036980	platinum to give
23036980	23039140	Achievement wise
23039140	23043060	I don't know if you need a hundred percent dna for the achievements
23044580	23047540	War machines are infamous for a reason. Yeah
23049540	23052580	There's a difference in a hundred to give a hundred percent achievements. Um
23053380	23060900	So, yeah, I thought we could maybe attempt to a hundred percent the dna sequence, but yeah
23061700	23066260	It ain't looking good. I mean, how long oh, it's already been six hours. What the heck?
23068500	23070020	Okay
23070020	23072580	Yeah, I didn't like I thought I was only gonna
23072980	23074980	What was I supposed to do?
23074980	23079940	Use a kick attack against over here. I literally thought
23080580	23082580	Um
23084820	23087940	If you don't do it now move these kids should be a thing you come back to at a later time
23088180	23091460	I think so. I think three days of like Assassin's Creed brotherhood in a row is a bit
23091860	23097060	It's a bit too much, but I'm perfectly happy to like come across the save file. That's not a problem
23097140	23099140	Um
23108580	23110580	Oh, no, no, we're not doing this
23115300	23117940	We're not doing this horse feature, but leave me alone. You're scaring me
23118900	23120900	Oh
23125140	23129460	Oh, whoa, I actually dodged that successfully, but the game said no, so
23133300	23138740	I true love with this game with a hundred percent. Oh steady on have you seen what the requirements are on some of the missions? Oh
23140340	23142340	That a wee bit of a
23142660	23145620	That a wee bit much for me honestly like I love this game
23145860	23147860	But I think, um
23149140	23151140	Definitely
23151300	23155940	Wouldn't mind coming back to to attempt it, but I think three days of Assassin's Creed brotherhood in a row
23155940	23164260	Maybe ain't the choice. We'll try and needy streamer and it'll be a smaller stream tomorrow, which means I can go get the
23166100	23170020	Sweets that I'm using for that hand cam stream. I need to like prepare for it and saw
23170420	23176420	I don't even know what to wear. He he I'm actually gonna have to put clothes on for one
23179620	23181620	Uh, I don't even know
23184740	23190260	And one achievement requires you to reach level 50. Oh, yeah, no, no, not those achievements like the dna
23192180	23194180	Are we going up?
23194260	23196260	cancer crime, which we
23196740	23198740	Have to is a strong word
23200980	23207620	Open one of the first three game the bourgeois have constructed a deadly naval war machine base on the in our design
23207620	23210020	It must be destroyed before chesery
23211380	23214100	Good dreams. Talk to Eduraro
23216420	23218420	Ed Uardo
23219860	23223460	I assume this is a don't get caught. It's giving don't get caught. Yeah
23224340	23226340	That only
23227940	23229940	I'm just a little fish
23232260	23235460	No, I'm a fish. You didn't see me
23236260	23239620	I'm just a fish a fishy fishy fish
23240340	23242820	Swimming in the deep canal
23244660	23246660	Fish fishy swim
23247140	23249140	Um, actually
23249860	23253460	If you hold the block button with the sword ball in the horse coming out, you can knock the raider then
23254500	23256660	Oh, it's it was gasman prayer me
23262420	23265060	Clothes strong a have six honestly

23285220	23287220	Grazie
23288020	23290020	Like I said, I chose life today. Thank you
23295860	23300820	Uh interacting with the gondola will cause desynchronization
23301140	23303140	I
23304020	23306020	I scratch my nose
23308740	23311620	How taller you 162 centimeters
23312660	23313780	um
23313780	23315780	taller than
23316580	23320020	Smoke bomb disables guards assassin or sleep before it wears off
23322180	23329460	Um, excuse me, but the actual phone am I not allowed to kill? Oh, so why not?
23331860	23333860	Uh

23347700	23349700	Oh
23352580	23356500	Okay, okay, okay, we're getting taller than a smoke ball
23357460	23360420	What's that banana freedom uh five three
23364900	23366900	I've not played assassin for the origin
23369540	23374500	You're like me also have issues wearing clothes. It's just no fun me. Okay, something's a fun
23377300	23379300	Mmm
23379380	23381860	I just put I just pushed that man in the water and he drowned
23382180	23386500	I will say one thing though, if you're a gondola pusher and you don't know how to swim
23386820	23390660	Isn't that a bit dangerous? Isn't that a bit silly?
23393940	23395780	I don't even realize I was supposed to be up here
23399540	23405300	Whoa, wait, why can't he see me? I thought we purposely put these beams here so you can't get seen by the guards below
23406180	23408180	Oh
23409780	23412260	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa my part in my bag
23414900	23418580	I'm gonna do that just so you know, where is it? Oh
23420980	23427540	Pitching wasn't the problem is that you touched the boat. Oh, I can't believe it finding Nemo. I touched the boat
23431780	23433780	How many slower me
23436020	23438020	Oh
23457540	23461060	The freaking twat from across the street saw me
23461380	23463380	Hey
23463700	23465700	Yeah, you do that on the way again
23466420	23469300	You'd be surprised I was in the Navy and only passed the swim test because
23471700	23473700	Proctor wanted me to go home. Jeez
23476660	23478660	And
23478980	23482580	I think if you're Scottish you have to learn to swim like you're forced to go to swimming
23484180	23489700	Yeah, let's just run ahead of this guard because he can't see me at the corner of his eye, but I get out of range
23490180	23492180	Which is good
23493140	23495140	Gondola logging
23495460	23497460	I've only got five poisons
23498580	23500580	It probably just
23500820	23504500	Man, I've got 19 crossbow bolts. They're quiet. I don't get
23506900	23508900	So it's all good
23511860	23513860	Uh, right
23516100	23518100	That's fine
23518420	23520420	It's fine. That's fine. So who
23527140	23531060	Okay, so this time the freaking guy doesn't notice me. Yeah, that's what I thought me
23537060	23540340	Doesn't even spot me this time sting
23549060	23551060	We'll set the stall and we go
23554900	23556900	Oh, I need to go up

23611300	23619620	I believe the 100% will not happen this stream it I did not I did not anticipate
23621140	23623140	How hard this game is
23623300	23626260	Because I've never attempted it before like I genuinely don't know how it goes
23627140	23629540	Um, right. I'm gonna poison him and the other
23629780	23633860	Oh, hey, where where where
23637940	23641540	I almost deseed but I think I hit a checkpoint

23651060	23655620	I don't even know how you saw me. I'm up here. They're not supposed to be able to see you from up here
23655620	23664100	Yeah, like that guy really there's like more cool. Oh that
23666260	23668260	Get me in the war. No
23678100	23680100	I like that
23680100	23682100	Oh
23682100	23684100	Okay, that's pretty good detail
23684580	23686580	No, no
23688180	23694260	It feels literally drowning right now. He needs to catch a breath of freaking air because I keep making him go under
23696500	23698500	Oh, goodness me. I don't think we make a
23700660	23703940	Oh goodness me. They're not making this one easy, aren't they?
23703940	23705940	Oh
23710980	23712180	Oh
23712180	23718500	He took a sword out. I heard it, but he needs to breathe or else he pops up for too long. He needs to breathe
23720340	23724100	I need to breathe just thinking about how long he's holding his breath honestly. Um
23725300	23728900	Please don't do the animation where you can't breathe. Please
23730500	23732500	Oh, we did it
23734020	23736020	Oh for goodness sake, there's more
23742820	23744820	Breathe
23749620	23751060	One
23751060	23752820	two
23752820	23754420	Reeve
23754420	23755460	One
23755460	23762980	Okay, I think maybe I can kill those ones because that was really rough, right? So that was too much bright olden
23764020	23766020	Any breathers in chat we stay driven
23768740	23772340	I'm going to scotland into the whoa. Wait, how far back are we?
23776180	23778180	Huh
23778180	23780180	That's pretty far back
23783940	23785940	Okay, like I did here
23786660	23793220	Oh, I've just wasted so much time dropping myself back here by here. I'm breathing is overrated honestly
23794420	23796420	I
23798020	23800420	Know the game's telling me to swim under this but like
23801140	23808980	So much freaking time like that guy is going so fast and as we gondola like he knows that I'm literally trying to swim behind him in time
23809780	23811780	he's such a lot like
23812260	23815140	You know, I'm freaking behind you. Slow it down
23817300	23820340	Literally, I'm trying to like silently swim is not even possible
23824820	23831140	I think if I just hang off the pier and assassinate him, this is the best way forward for this
23832500	23834500	Sorry mate, but time's up
23836500	23840820	Okay, yeah, that's far more easier. I just need to do it to the other guy on the pier. Sorry
23844740	23849620	Oxygen addicts honestly can't get enough of it. You're so greedy, huh?
23854900	23856900	Okay, let's die
23858900	23864500	And then breathe and then die and then breathe and then yank
23866420	23872020	Ezio, please do not go on the platform when it comes to assassinating freaking gods
23874180	23875780	Ezio
23875780	23880500	You knew fine. Well, I was asking you to pull him into the water
23881460	23883700	Not get on the platform

24176020	24178020	But hey, ho
24178900	24182420	You can't see me because you're dead by the time you process. It's me

24216020	24218020	Drive home

24347060	24349700	Possibly can I do all three though?
24352180	24359460	I think I'm gonna have to row a bit closer to this one at the back here. I think that's it. That should be good
24361540	24364660	No, I didn't hit it. Oopsies
24367540	24369540	Oh
24383620	24387060	I don't think you can go back through so we're just gonna
24388740	24390740	Do a thing
24391620	24395060	You're now notorious guards are on high alert. I should hope so
24395940	24400980	Because I'm still here me it's you. Oh, they knocked me off my my gun
24401700	24405620	I don't even know what you're doing. Hold on lads. I need to rotate before I destroy his
24406580	24408420	Do give me a second
24408420	24412180	You just need to rotate. I actually don't think I can hit it from this distance. You know that
24412660	24414340	Ow, I'm
24414340	24416340	Wait, whoa, what's happening?
24417060	24422020	Okay, hold on. Hold on. We need to like do a big old circle around because
24423620	24428020	That I'm like too close to even hit this stuff
24431940	24434420	Honestly black flag for all take for real
24439860	24444180	Going reverse so so can you go backwards? I don't even know if I can
24445140	24447460	I don't try it. We're just in the old spin around
24449700	24451700	Did that hit I hope so
24454260	24457540	Almost there we go beautiful beautiful
24459220	24463140	And last but not least let's not get too close now. Let's not get too close
24464900	24466900	Still got some momentum
24467380	24469380	Oh
24469700	24474900	One more rule should do it get us front row seats to this pirate ship going down
24479620	24481700	Oh, they're hurting me they're hurting me
24485460	24487460	Just a range hold on
24490020	24493780	I'm like just there no more. Oh you guys are hurting me
24494740	24496740	You're giving me a booboo
24499060	24502100	Just just a range that was so close
24502740	24504740	Right a little bit of a push
24504740	24507620	I just don't want to get too close to the point where I can't even freaking aim
24509620	24511620	There we go we got there we got them
24513140	24518740	It literally is your tank in all the arrows. Okay, that was kind of for me. Take the way they are jumped off the ship
24524740	24528180	However, they don't want you on you. Honestly, there's literally cannonballs
24529780	24534260	Literally be a BRB. Sorry. I can't aim at your shills. Let me just do a little spin around. Oh
24536820	24538820	Oh, we're shooting at ourselves
24542900	24544900	Wow
24545140	24547140	Oh
24554180	24556180	We actually go 100 sink for that. Okay
24559780	24565860	I used to love this game then you have fantastic taste because this is my number one game of all time and I suck at it
24568900	24570260	New
24570260	24575700	Right, hold on. Is there one more Leonardo mission? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay
24577700	24581780	Uh, how are they always on the opposite place?
24588500	24594420	Right, we're finished this Leonardo and then we'll get the gales faction
24594900	24596900	In
24598500	24600980	Tank tank tank you are good at sucking
24613220	24617300	Sorry, I'm making an animated shot of your reference sheet for the meme tag
24618580	24620660	Should I uh bring in the tweet?
24621220	24623220	Um
24623860	24628820	I don't know if when it comes to memification of something you don't have to credit the original rs
24628900	24632020	I don't know. What do you guys think you're probably better know than me like
24633140	24635620	I did credit her like right under the
24636260	24642100	Thingy so like people know it is by her under the reference sheet like at all times. I don't know
24644660	24646660	These hay bales were soaking
24646980	24648980	So
24650500	24656420	One of the games are the most uh called dynasty warriors ac brotherhood was the last game I truly played in the series
24657220	24659620	Yeah, revelations was all right
24660500	24662500	but
24662820	24664820	It wasn't brotherhood
24666900	24672020	If I had to rank them it's brotherhood then ac2 and then revelations for exo storyline
24672980	24679860	I went on an adventure trying to beat up all oh to beat all of this asca games, but I stopped at syndica. Hmm
24681540	24685620	I think I've played assassins creed three maybe unironically three times. Um
24687620	24689620	It's just no fun
24694180	24697940	ACR had uh fucking turret defense literally the turret defense
24698900	24703700	Do slash credit. Yeah, maybe do slash credit just so it's not like
24704420	24707220	Bothering but the credit is there for people who do want to
24709700	24712900	Yeah, people say they love black flag I struggled so much to get into it
24712900	24718100	But I'm wondering if it's just because I'm like a little cry baby because ac wasn't like in the series anymore
24719860	24725300	Which is very plausible. I wouldn't I wouldn't mind to try and get black flag one more big hood. Uh
24725940	24727940	Um
24728980	24730420	But I just
24730420	24735940	Really seem to struggle with the controls, but it's probably because I'm doing the well
24735940	24741060	I've already played assassins creed. So I don't need to sit and read the controls. Well, obviously they have changed the controls
24742580	24744580	So
24744740	24746740	I'm you've been a quiet boy, baby
24750100	24752260	Valhalla
24752260	24755860	I wish they would make more like story multiplayer games like
24757220	24759140	It takes two
24759140	24761460	It's like such a good story thing
24761780	24766900	And I would absolutely love to play games like that on stream and be like, okay after the first chapter
24766980	24772820	We'll get someone else in okay next chapter. We'll like get someone else in but like they just don't need to do that. They just don't need to do that
24774740	24776340	It's annoying
24776340	24778340	So annoying
24779140	24781540	I can't believe I can't play video games the exact same
24782500	24784500	Exactly the way I want to play them
24785700	24787700	It's such a baby
24790980	24794820	Kill the template overseer to recover map use the pistol a
24798020	24800020	I can do that
24808900	24810900	Oh
24812420	24816660	No, yes, no, yes
24822100	24828180	Yeah, I was gonna see you sure you want to fake this. Oh wow, it's always you guys that want to fake stop this
24829940	24834740	Hawkins and not really I'll see if I can loot a smoke bomb back
24838500	24841780	I've been having a blast watching a veteran in a newcomer play the hero
24843540	24846180	That oh, yeah, the halo campaign is gonna be playable
24856420	24858900	Okay, last one question mark, I think
24859860	24861860	You
24864340	24866340	That's the other mission
24866980	24868980	Halo 3 plugin
24870340	24872980	Is it like safe to do a halo campaign?
24874580	24878340	That would be really cool to do a refling. It's not gonna lie. I'd be pretty hyped for that
24878580	24880580	But I don't know how safe it is to like add people
24881860	24884260	Because I don't think I can just instance and have you guys in
24885140	24891220	It would be pretty pretty cool to like I don't is it joe only or is it four man?
24894420	24899140	Favorite game combat of bill is it evolved or yeah or evolution
24903140	24905540	Oh my gosh, it's john halo from fortnight
24907140	24912260	Lean out his tank is an ambitious and devastating war machine capable do not take any damage well in the tank
24912260	24914260	Yeah, good luck for that. We're not in the fun
24925620	24928500	Have name poison which is decent
24942980	24948260	Yeah, we're not doing that. Um, literally everyone's getting poisoned. I don't care
24952180	24955220	We have name the wash to bought some more at a healer
24960180	24963780	Yeah, maybe if it's safe to add people like on halo then
24964660	24967940	You could do playthroughs of that, but I guess you
24968740	24972980	We could only do a mission by mission. So like we would do one mission and then
24974020	24976260	Kick out and then add and then next mission
24978100	24980100	You know
24982420	24984420	We see nothing
24987300	24992340	How did you guys not sure it's a poison dart so it's supposed to just be like a little swing
24993300	24995060	And no one knows
24995060	25000740	Literally poison is so peefer like when it comes to don't be detected because you can walk right in front of them and
25001380	25003380	Obviously the crossbow does the exact same thing
25005140	25007140	Yeah, poison's cool
25007300	25009300	Oops. Sorry. Sorry. Oh
25009540	25013700	I was pulling down my sleeves. I'm getting uh, that's right. I'm wearing a hoodie

25027380	25031460	Love how as soon as you go sideways, they just don't care anymore. They're like and
25040100	25042100	Beat up the architect. Oh, okay
25046180	25048180	Hello
25053300	25058900	What are the plans for the weapon? You're so aggressive. I feel like goodness. You just ask before beating up

25097060	25099540	Sucks to suck. Sorry, but if I'm gonna have to bear
25101300	25104980	Uh, we could do two poisons here just to be doubly sure

25564740	25566740	And you can set up custom
25567140	25569140	things like if someone

25684260	25686260	Just don't take damage five head
25687380	25692900	Some of the ever played the game modded before me who mods it so I can't take damage sucking because there's no damage hits
25694020	25696020	runs
25696340	25698340	Some of the freaking

25720340	25723780	It's news I spread that all my inventions have been destroyed
25724180	25726980	The disarray allowed me to work on something just for you
25727700	25733140	What is this story underwear to drift slowly from any height? It is not as cumbersome as my flying machine
25733540	25735540	You can take it everywhere
25738100	25742180	Okay, I think I know what we do with that
25744260	25747700	I think I know what we do with it
25748500	25750500	Uh
25754740	25760900	99% sure I know what we do with it. Y'all don't mind if we go do it right now
25765540	25772260	That was Leonardo da Vinci, you're right. You're not wrong. You're right. Oh, maybe I could have gone off that surface. Oh well
25772580	25774580	Um
25776100	25778980	I think it's just one of the guild requirements
25780180	25782180	To use the parachute
25783380	25787940	Whoa. Oh, there's a bank actually. I'm gonna take my bank money out because it looks cool
25791140	25793140	I can find the bank
25794180	25797620	Good evening. Good afternoon, mr. Bankman
25798660	25801940	Can I have my landlord simulate? Whoa? Where the heck is this bank?
25802580	25806420	Oh, it's out. Can I have the landlord simulator part of this game?
25809220	25813620	Is he counting coins? Why is he leaning over like that? He looks so insidious like volume
25814580	25816580	My coins
25821140	25824100	12 never came so mean as we just went away lol
25824660	25826660	Oh
25829540	25833460	Hello bank. I was like one million. I want one zillion dollars
25835220	25837220	We're it we're it
25840580	25842580	Right next we're gonna do challenges
25844500	25846500	To get our guild
25848420	25851220	To play decoration to play room decoration
25851220	25854420	So I've done landlord simulator. We're now doing room decoration
25857380	25860740	Uh and then after that
25863300	25870100	I think we actually have done like the main we're gonna take some of the layouts of this place
25872500	25877620	He actually just gave you sheets to take it's it's his laundry. He's like here it's all for you, buddy
25878340	25884820	Why not jump with me and why not jump with me? That's such a smart. I wonder if he only says that line
25885460	25887460	If you jump here
25889860	25894500	Butcher, it's not a butcher. Why do you keep saying butcher? I don't know
25895940	25897940	They both begin with letter b
25898420	25899460	So
25899460	25903380	Yeah, maybe that's why instead of blacksmiths I say butcher
25908340	25910900	Up next animal crossing decorating rooms
25912420	25914420	I
25914420	25917220	Personally will never stream animal crossing
25918500	25923540	I don't know if I why what whoa, they boarded me out
25926260	25927860	Ah
25927860	25929540	bridge
25929540	25933300	Like I don't know if I can make uh animal crossing fun
25934980	25936420	like
25936420	25938020	Maybe it's um
25938020	25941220	I don't know. I couldn't make it fun. I don't mind watching other people play it
25941220	25944180	But me I'm like I ain't that creative to make it in our game
25946420	25948820	I love all the games that start with ac on full
25949940	25953060	Right, so I guess the only way to get back into the castle is this way from now on
25954020	25956660	Whoa, we have over a hundred thousand forums
25958340	25959700	Uh
25959700	25961700	Right I can
25962180	25964180	Can I walk through that gate? No
25965140	25970580	That would be too easy. I wonder actually probably post game. They should actually open that gate
25970580	25972980	I said what said because like chaseries no longer a thing
25975940	25977940	Yeah, okay, so I've got a dm
25978900	25982180	I'm getting nervous. I'm like, oh no, is there something wrong with my babies if I've got a dm
25985780	25987780	Everything is cute
25989220	25992900	Oh, we have the thumbnails for our first group collab
25994900	26000260	And that is what I knew how how interesting I'll let it be a mystery
26006660	26009300	Rest well those who have to go. Thank you for hanging
26010660	26015060	Uh mercy is going live and two minus
26015780	26018180	one hour and 45 for
26018820	26019860	of
26019860	26022980	How the heck did I get up? I've completely forgotten all over again
26024340	26026660	Just go straight up like that. I guess

26081860	26086740	No, that guy actually can see you here if you get really unlucky, but you know
26087940	26090340	Morning, then uh, Europe's waking up
26092340	26094340	Whoop whoop you're coming to Europe
26096180	26099620	Okay, yeah, okay, the assassin signals being able to that is like

26153620	26157220	I have no idea what time zone I'm like perfect for
26159060	26165540	But then again, am I technically not perfect for all time zones if I stream really long, huh?
26167220	26169220	Yeah
26172340	26176180	I don't think we're doing a 12 hours before anyone is strapped in
26178660	26183380	So some people will be relieved to hear that we're not doing another 12 hours at the spotting home
26184020	26189300	Uh, I think when we do Eldon ring it will be a few back-to-back 12 hours
26192020	26194020	Yeah, you fit all time zones, huh
26197620	26199620	If I had a healthy sleep

26289060	26292820	Uh, I'm being papaga. How do I tell the parachute to come out?
26295780	26297780	Dad just launch and press x
26300100	26305700	Right, I don't I don't want to go that way because that won't activate the jump
26306660	26313860	Yeah, they the assassins are really struggling should prompt do a flip. Okay
26315380	26317380	What we did go to go that way
26320740	26322580	No point in going in the back in the street
26325300	26329300	Uh, uh, whatever the prompt is bloody hope it comes up because
26330660	26332980	It is not on the wheel
26336660	26343780	Oh, there we go. Oh, thank god, right. I need to do like a ton of distance. I guess I'll just go over the war
26345220	26347700	I was really worried that prompt wasn't gonna come out
26350820	26353700	I think I need to glade like 500 meters
26359540	26363780	Uh, am I gonna make the glade?
26366660	26368660	Am I gonna make the glade? Hello
26370660	26374900	Oh, am I not gonna make it come on pop pop pop pop
26376740	26380260	No, I don't want to claim it again. Please pop. What was that supposed to do?
26384420	26388900	Why did that all pop? I was supposed something was supposed to pop there not the achievement
26391860	26394340	What was supposed to what did I do wrong?
26396100	26398100	I wasn't assassins
26399860	26401860	Was it thieves because they're agile?
26403620	26416340	Glade and a cumulative total of 500 meters. I'm not to turn at all
26418900	26420740	Okay
26420740	26427940	No, I hope you guys have the same patience for me because I need to do that all over again. I don't know
26429700	26431220	Cumulative
26431220	26434420	All right, I'll just do it again because I should pop then
26435700	26439380	Just do it multiple times. Yes, right. We're gonna zoom it because at least I know exactly where to go
26441700	26443700	Wait
26444820	26446820	You can do it cheeky from time
26447780	26450660	I thought you could do it in one jump for some reason
26462980	26468500	There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
26469780	26471780	If you're trying
26472260	26474260	Oh, I'm breaking free

26489860	26494900	Ah, all the guards have been spawned. I can't believe it. I can't believe this castle is full of guards
26496420	26498420	Shorting behavior
26498500	26503540	Get out. Anyone wants you here? Oh, my ankles. I didn't take any fall damage. Okay

26515540	26518180	But I was like, I don't know if it's like bordering on cringe
26520100	26524980	I was like, I don't know what m&m song I wanted to do. Well, what a fun effort all
26528420	26530420	I've got
26530580	26535220	You got any clue what's going on? Do you? No, you didn't. You've spawned. That's all right
26537380	26539780	You threw me. I don't know what one to do
26541140	26544500	I'm beginning to feel like a wee bit of a rap god
26546820	26548820	I don't know what I'm doing
26550980	26555540	Yes, who's back back back back again again

26579780	26584020	Because this is the part where the rap breaks down. No one moves. No one makes a sound
26584100	26586500	I'm just mixing into a ton of different songs. I think
26596580	26599620	Okay, that was very lucky you can actually go backwards

26781140	26784020	This each other, but I think like a diss track on each other would be so funny
26784260	26788980	Like I know it's brain dead, but it's like, I don't know. I just find that content like funny like interact with each other in that
26788980	26790980	kind of way words. Yeah, like

26936180	26938020	Maybe vtuber should do rap battles
26938020	26941780	But like the problem is I don't have any music or lyrical thing
26941940	26945540	So I would have to like go out and commission to do it and then I would need to grab vtubers
26945540	26947860	I'd be willing to like let us diss each other like
26948980	26950500	Oh

27297860	27299860	I
27300340	27301700	Invade
27301700	27306820	Invade four times or something. I've already forgotten the other freaking thing I was supposed to do
27307700	27310500	One enemy stationed at guard post. Okay, we're actually gonna uh
27311620	27318260	Stations guard post we're actually gonna do that in a memory because there's a memory that enables that
27318500	27320500	Horses belonging to guards commandeered
27321220	27323220	Horses yoinked
27323300	27325300	Without killing
27326020	27328020	Um

27362020	27364020	And then put the discord there
27364980	27371300	And now I can oh wait. No, I can't see it. Oh the screenshot makes it so tiny that I can't see it
27371300	27373300	I need to type it out right six
27373460	27377700	Six thieves lured. I did it for anyway. No, it's the picture
27377860	27382420	It's because if it's a picture I need to have like discord and small sprint uninterrupted sprint
27383300	27385300	four three hundred
27386580	27389940	21 leaps of faith. I need to 40 leaps of faith

27653860	27659860	It's you. You're a bit too efficient at your job. I didn't actually want to assassinate them
27660980	27663060	Talk about a third monitor and I still only have one
27666100	27668100	If you come to be sure you might need three
27671540	27673540	Moment and mummy are you? Yeah
27675140	27677140	Or mommy
27678500	27680980	Uh, wait, what I needed to I need to go do horse missions
27681780	27683780	Right, we're gonna go to the thieves guild
27685380	27687380	Which I totally know the name all
27688340	27690340	The thieves guild
27691140	27693140	Why is it all the way down here?
27694340	27697540	Is that like the last one? You know what?
27701460	27703460	Yeah, you're dumb
27704740	27706740	She would never diss me. She loved me
27707700	27712740	Oh, I can't remember what my diss was on you. I've already forgot. I thought I was like a zero duly more like

27715940	27719540	That's really like the most rubbish things like nonsense
27720420	27724660	I was trying to do like visual number of horror games. Are we allowed to recommend? Yeah, you can always recommend stuff

27734260	27737140	Uh, definitely recommend going to the thieves guild in order to this
27738340	27740340	Is there a delay more like fun to the bosom?
27745620	27752660	Your third monitor should be used exclusively to ignore chat. Why would I ignore chat? It's literally the best part of streaming
27756180	27759060	Other than like when the gameplay gets intense then uh
27759940	27761940	I'm thinking for that
27762020	27764740	It's really like a perfect circle here. Can I just come circles?
27765540	27769380	If you get motion sick close your eyes mercy. Look away. Don't watch stream here, man
27773380	27778020	What would happen if it's the oddest time of each of our I think you'd have a lot of fun girls

28329300	28335860	Uh, right. We basically need to go back and forth over and over jumping on this beam
28337460	28340660	No, you didn't do it. See oh that wasn't it. That wasn't the trick
28341220	28347700	We needed to do that flip you saw literally 19 times more do a flip. It's you
28348580	28352900	Right and I want to know it see we'll try again
28354580	28356580	They need to jump a specific
28363700	28367700	Jump holds flip. Okay jump hold flip
28368260	28372500	So I need to tap a and then hold it so 18 more time
28375460	28377060	Jump hold
28377060	28382340	No, okay. I think we needed a bit more speed that time a bit more give us a bit more energy a bit more energy
28382580	28383540	little
28383540	28385540	Little bull's eye a little horsey-worsy
28386500	28388500	Do a better run up for it hold
28389380	28392180	And that horse just blocked us and jump and hold
28393300	28395300	Why did that not work that chain?
28397700	28399700	I'm not sure why that didn't work
28402500	28404500	Yeah, but we'll talk with those. It's not bad
28405380	28409300	Didn't in the corner my right and uh jump
28409940	28416100	Okay, I purposely did that a bit later than when I would have selected a so it's 17 more
28417700	28419380	I can do it
28419380	28422340	Uh betley. Oh, no, okay, right
28423060	28430740	Are you gonna have to bear with me bear with me I see is in this room right now because you're gonna have to bear with me
28431300	28433300	Bear with me
28433460	28435460	few seconds
28436260	28441140	Steady jump and hold. Yay 16 more times. Let's go
28442980	28447060	I definitely seem to be able to do it come in from that way. I'm wondering if I can't do it this way
28447140	28450180	Maybe there's like a hidden bug and I jump and hold
28453300	28455300	Maybe it's the one way type of
28457860	28459380	We're getting there
28459380	28466740	70 more. Let's go. Literally. It's like, oh, I'm so glad you guys put this really arbitrary arbitrary. Okay, really
28467460	28472340	Really premature with that one. I'm not gonna I'm not even gonna. No, no the horse
28474340	28476020	That was uh
28476020	28478020	Let's try that again
28478180	28483780	Yeah, literally. I wish the NPCs would actually calm down about my rely. Oh, no
28486580	28490260	I honestly, I'm not sure how I'm getting it sometimes and not other times
28491060	28495140	My only guess is that an NPC is making it so like
28495620	28497380	pathing mess up
28497380	28499380	Jump hold
28500980	28502980	What is going on
28503460	28506740	What is going on? I'm not actually sure why sometimes I'm getting that right
28506740	28509460	We'll do a really big run up just because we can
28511540	28519380	Okay, so run and then stand and then jump and hold. Okay. Okay. It's speed. It's speed. We need it
28519380	28521380	We need a bigger run up 15 more times
28522900	28530180	15 more times. Okay big big long journey one two three four five jump and hold
28530180	28538100	15 is still the number. We can't do it. This is not at all
28539300	28543300	A bit of a grind. I don't know why so a bit more of a grind than I was expecting. Run
28545060	28547060	And jump and hold
28550260	28552260	I honestly don't understand what's determined in
28553300	28554260	a
28554260	28556260	Maybe do the middle one like jump lay
28557220	28560500	I think you may be right. We'll jump lay on purpose this time. Okay
28562580	28565540	Not doing it. Not doing it. Not doing it. We'll jump now and hold. No
28569940	28571940	Thank you for at least coming back
28576740	28578740	15 is better than 20
28580180	28585620	And 14 is better than 15. Whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no
28586260	28589300	No, no, no, no, no
28592260	28597620	No is the appropriate response after seeing that out loud
28600740	28602740	Oh, all right. No, that didn't work
28604100	28606660	Uh, I think I'm getting speed blocked or something
28608100	28610820	Because this is what we're on 14 or
28611860	28614900	13 no, not 13 close to 13
28617060	28620020	We can do it. I literally feel like Bilbo Baggins when he's like
28620820	28626580	Uh, he's like trying not to be like a bit. Um, just growing old with like the door showing up
28627540	28631140	And I'm like, oh, it's fine. It's fine. No
28632580	28634580	This is very
28639220	28645220	Maybe you have to be under the beams. Okay, I'll definitely like I'll super delay at this time like genuinely super delay
28647220	28653220	No, he just he just jumped straight on it if you do it like super delayed. Okay
28656100	28661380	Curious curious, right? I'll try again because 14
28663780	28666980	Like I can do this honestly. It's just so
28667940	28671540	I'm trying to avoid that guy. I try to avoid that guy. I think
28672260	28674260	I just need to let the horse maybe
28674340	28681780	Directly steer even if the horse is a little off because my the steering as soon as I stand on the horse's saddle the steering
28685140	28687140	Oh
28688260	28693060	So I just realized since you're in Australia, does that mean you've been streaming 3m? 4am is my stream time
28695140	28697140	Daylight saving and stuff
28697460	28699460	But it's healthy
28699780	28701780	It's healthy
28701780	28708820	It's it means I can do stuff during the day. Oh 13 13. Okay. I don't know. I genuinely didn't do anything different
28708900	28711300	I think it really is just luck of the draw or something because
28712180	28714180	I did not do anything
28715780	28718260	Ah, I was gonna say hopefully we get to in a row
28720500	28726020	This is such a bizarre like challenge type thing honestly
28730420	28732420	No, why why why?
28733940	28735940	30 no, not 30 13
28739060	28741060	Spreads build up just straight up and uh
28742820	28744820	All bits are so like
28745380	28748900	He acts annoyed in the moment. See. Yeah, that was like hardly any build up
28748900	28750900	So I think that's why that one's in the one
28753060	28760020	Mmm, um, let's not be knocking down women. I only want to knock up women. Thank you very much
28761060	28764900	Oh, wait, I don't want to knock down women. I only want to knock them up
28766660	28768660	Please laugh
28772340	28774340	One more time without doing a massive thing
28778900	28780900	Uh
28782100	28788580	Yeah, I forgot I forgot I had it too. Okay. I forgot legit. I'll need to add a laughing track as well. Oh
28789140	28793700	Brother this guy's thanks. Yeah, I'm gonna have to add uh
28794180	28797460	Um, I'll add a laughing track. I should add a laughing track
28797540	28799940	That's like one that's good and then one that's like
28800580	28805300	Uh, I gets a few coughs and like a giggle. So it's like a bad joke. I'm definitely need to get that
28806260	28808260	Hmm
28808580	28813940	I need to hydrate my goodness. I'm like trying so hard to figure out like what's determined in this jump or not
28816820	28818820	I need some crickets. Yeah
28820420	28823220	Do the joke again. I let my laugh in my other jacket
28824420	28827860	Oh, you left your laugh in the other jacket. Ha ha you spelt it wrong
28828100	28832580	Everyone pointing laugh you spelt his thing wrong and I read it out and now he's embarrassed
28832900	28838980	Ha ha ha streamer read out your message with a spelling error. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh that that was just gross
28843380	28845380	Right, okay, we're gonna try gallop now
28846660	28850180	The only issue with galloping is if you gallop through a crowd too much
28853460	28857860	No, that was far too early. Okay. I'm kind of struggled with it. We'll try the gallop from this side
28858820	28865620	It's over. It's over. You'll never recover. Your social credit has been determined
28865940	28871620	No, okay, that gallop doesn't seem to enable that jump whatsoever. I like how the horse is so responsive
28871620	28873620	It's like where'd you go? Please come back
28876100	28878100	Oh, is it the digration?
28879140	28881140	Degoration degradation
28881300	28883300	Degration degradation
28883300	28885300	Degration sounds correct
28885460	28887960	Instead of degradation. Oh 12
28889860	28895060	I'm just so surprised when it does happen. It seems to happen in that direction more than it happens in this
28897140	28899460	No, look close it's over not quite
28901060	28903460	I do want you on the beans, but I want you to do that
28903460	28906100	We fancy flip that you do they should have made it 10
28906580	28911060	No, they actually shouldn't have done this all because literally how would you have discovered that it so can even do this?
28911140	28914180	I'm sorry, but I would never have naturally discovered that he could do this
28916180	28918180	Good night. Rest well. Thank you for hanging
28919940	28921940	We're uh
28921940	28925460	Oh, I actually can't see how long I've been streaming for I've accidentally covered it up with my uh
28926020	28928900	Little list of things that I need to do. Oopsie. Whoopsie
28930180	28932180	Oh, that was like really
28936020	28938660	It feels like has cooled down honestly
28939460	28942420	The brain rot took over. Yeah, it took over long ago. I apologize
28943140	28946100	Eight hours. I've only been streaming eight hours. I've got a few more in me
28948900	28951700	I want this one over because I never want to have to do it again
28952660	28954260	Like I don't want to have to come back to this
28954420	28959220	I but I know you guys have been literally watching me do a backflip on do a flip on a horse for like 10 minutes
28959220	28961700	Now it's gonna be just no one's laughing
28963380	28968340	Getting aggravating it right. I am running. I am running. I'm holding
28969220	28971220	Oh
28971620	28973620	11
28974900	28981620	Okay, I think it's 11. No, I don't know why right. I'll run up for ages. Hold. No
28985300	28987700	Oh, we're almost 50% of the way there
28991460	28993060	Absolutely
28993060	28994500	Only
28994500	28999300	Oh, well, you guys are gonna feel at a place when you see me only only for like two hours tomorrow
28999460	29001460	You're gonna be like, what's wrong? Is she sick?
29004100	29007700	Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no, you have done
29014580	29019780	10 10 right. I feel like it always happens come in this direction instead of the other direction
29020740	29026340	I feel like you can't even do a flip. We're not flipping out on you. You're not flipping out on me
29029460	29033620	Insert laugh track here that I still haven't added yet, but I will have the laugh tracks into him
29034980	29036980	Please get the heck out of my way. I'm trying to do
29037860	29039860	You
29046740	29049540	Can you leave me alone? No
29053380	29061060	No money is worth this he said I do need to kill from horseback. So maybe just do that real quick
29061780	29070180	We'll just do this one to add to the horseback one. So we're still making progress even though it's
29081300	29083380	Okay, that's that's the sound I need to add right now
29086180	29088180	But if I do the flip it goes
29088900	29091220	Don't worry, I'll get a little bit for you. I'm dead
29096420	29102420	Flipping on a beam off a whole horse this sucks and I don't know why they asked for 20
29106580	29109940	Stop taking people's horses. It's really not
29109940	29111940	No, I
29115300	29120900	I'm looking to see if there's like a prompt that's like double tap to do a beam or jump or whatever about
29123300	29127060	No happening, it's no happening, but we're halfway there. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it
29127060	29129060	We do it. We uh, well
29129140	29131140	That's probably not gonna work now. Is it? No
29134020	29138260	I have lost my mind literally I've been doing flips for thanks for so long
29138980	29140980	Please
29141060	29143460	Free me free me from the beam
29144260	29146580	Oh nine finally
29158020	29163060	No, it's you below the beam you could have easily sat back on the horse. I'll be honest
29163700	29168500	The skirt looks so funny. You mean has killed he's killed to kill to pull fun
29173540	29176340	Eight eight eight eight. Okay, that was actually
29178100	29181780	I think I need it. I think I can kill him and it'll count for the horseback
29183860	29185940	Oh, I'm getting a spank. I'm getting a spank. I'm sorry
29188820	29191140	Actually, I should probably do these guys from horseback as well
29194020	29196020	And there we go one
29197700	29199700	Two
29200900	29205220	Three or I'm going to throw rocks through your window
29208420	29210420	All right, let's try this game
29211140	29213140	Oh, no, don't jump no stick
29214020	29216020	Try going try going
29218820	29220820	You mustn't offend the last
29221380	29227460	You wouldn't you like me when I'm angry you can't you oh seven seven seven seven I think seven
29231460	29236340	I still have yet to figure out what determines it but once it's over with we don't have to do it again
29236420	29240820	We got a double. We got a double. We got a double. Oh my god. I've not done that. Can we do a triple?
29241700	29246660	Can we do a triple is like my subconscious understanding what I need to do even though my brain like my actual
29247220	29248580	conscious doesn't
29248580	29255940	No, we got a double though. So it's six only six more to go. I've never done back to that. That's fantastic
29257140	29260980	I was literally I'm like is my subconscious knowing what's up, but my conscious is like
29261860	29266900	Can't that was far too early me put my glicks on for that one. That's terrible
29269140	29271140	Wow, oh baby
29275780	29277780	Top 10 moments
29279220	29283380	Welcome to watch module. Well, we wait the work. We rate the worst
29285780	29290660	Little side quest things that assassin creep brotherhood randomly give you because it is a bit arbitrary
29301220	29306020	Only six more can you hold on for six
29309300	29314340	I'm starting to lose a little bit, but that's okay because we got five we got five
29316420	29318740	I was gonna take it will be be a triple get out of my hand
29319380	29325140	Look, I wasn't kidding when people like why would you just grave she be is like everything you should have been
29326420	29328820	I wasn't kidding. Was that kidding?
29330180	29332180	I was oh four four four
29333140	29335140	You
29354100	29356100	Or
29356100	29358100	Oh
29361460	29363460	We're sounded so country
29366700	29368700	Wow the sound of the ice cream
29374660	29377780	Three three three three three
29386100	29388100	Oh
29404140	29410100	The people listening in right now that are like waiting on mersey start they're like please for the love of god mersey start
29416540	29420860	One more one more one more one more one more
29422500	29432300	One more just one more time. We've got to celebrate. Oh, yeah jumping on the horse beam
29435260	29438380	Do the random say thing for the guilt
29446620	29448620	Oh
29452780	29457500	Don't don't ever be such a silly sausage again and
29460860	29463460	Your daddy your dad says they've gone
29464300	29468140	Don't ever give me such a silly thing again. That was absolute torture
29468780	29473580	Lure guards leap of faith guards air assassinate from a beam
29473980	29475980	No guards
29479940	29486020	Okay, the only thing I can think of doing is attracting these guards over here to no because they would have to be below me
29486500	29490900	Where is a beam that a rider goes past?
29491460	29493780	Because I think that's what I have to assassinate
29494500	29497140	So now forcing around no dive on I
29499620	29502860	Think if I do this I might get the horseback kills
29504180	29506180	I
29518380	29521420	Please come under this beam over here, please harass me under this beam
29521420	29524900	Please harass me under this beam. I can't believe the game literally just train me for this moment
29524900	29528380	Please come under the beam. Please come under the beam. I take all back. I'm sorry these skills
29534380	29536380	I'm sorry
29547500	29554260	Where the heck is this mystical beam that the enemies pass under I don't know where it's located
29554580	29557740	It's not up here doesn't feel like it's up here at all
29562220	29565660	Mission failed you get them next time literally where the heck are these beams?
29567140	29569140	Hardly any beams anywhere
29569940	29574980	The only beam around here is me having a beamer because of how freaking embarrassing this gameplay is
29577900	29583940	To have a beamer means that you are embarrassed and have scarlet face or a red face
29584260	29586260	Oh
29605580	29607580	Just to be
29608300	29612860	Volpe does have missions. I am going to buy ammo and
29613500	29618100	I'm gonna do this stationary guy one because it's really easy to do it in this quest
29619900	29626300	So I'm gonna go by ammo and we're gonna replay a mission that gives us one of these skills
29627980	29629980	requirements
29631420	29633420	Claudia yes, she does as well
29634500	29636020	I'm
29636020	29638380	Try to do sorry who goes there?
29642380	29644620	I think I'm actually gonna have to get rid of my rating
29653300	29655300	What is needy smart overload it is
29657060	29659100	Unfortunately, I actually don't know too much about the game
29659260	29662140	But it might be a good thing because we get to play for fun for the first time
29662500	29665820	I don't think it's gonna be a very long stream if you're wanting an endurance on that
29665820	29666940	I
29666940	29671420	Need to go to the shops to buy the sweets for the hand camswing stream
29672860	29674860	Why am I here?
29677020	29679020	Yeah, sure
29680140	29687340	Well, you're no cheap. Oh, I need to buy are I just realized that yeah, I need to buy like tons of art in all the different districts
29688820	29690980	To three hours. Yeah, that's like the perfect stream
29692820	29696780	Deep gargling didn't overstay as well. Oh, okay. Okay, I did
29697900	29699900	young man with an apple man
29702860	29707580	He's so done. He's like I have enough of posing. Oh, that's a cool one
29712820	29719620	But what art for here, oh wait, I'm like 90% sure you sell failure locations
29720100	29722100	Can you please resell me then
29723300	29724580	No
29724580	29728500	Yeah, the feathers. We'll grab the feathers. I'm sure another's one on the Colosseo
29731420	29738020	Are you gonna hundred percent avatar? No, I've never played the RDA side of avatar. I don't like the RDA side
29739740	29741740	Can I still visit Leonardo?
29742740	29747100	And I don't play the RDA side only play the Navi side and
29748060	29754580	It will just be done the Navi. I think the campaign's like six hours on that one if I can remember correctly
29759060	29764540	We'll be strange not seeing you before bed and waking up after yeah, it's gonna be an interesting day
29765420	29770580	But I do have endurance streams every week kind of planned as long as all goes well
29772100	29775420	I'll see what the clipping situation is
29779420	29781220	Hi Leonardo
29781220	29786460	It's you the people apartments are in turmoil. Yes, it is ill and the pope dead
29786940	29793140	It was your doing was it not Leonardo? I swear to you did not die by my end
29793740	29797940	This world gets stranger every day. I shall have to focus on my painting
29797940	29802100	I work on the small portrait of a woman. I'm growing rather fond of it
29803260	29808340	Do not let a beautiful girl distract you from constructing my designs. I have no worries
29809020	29811020	Women provide little distraction
29811380	29813380	Wait, I don't get it
29813940	29817900	He's a gay boy. It's you. Oh, it's pride month. Can he be like that man?
29819460	29822860	Can he be like that? That's nice. Oh, I have everything
29823860	29825860	I
29829940	29835900	Don't have anything to purchase Leonardo about everything wait if I talk to him again
29837420	29841600	You have all that I can give now. You're on your own. Ah, Leonardo
29842180	29844180	Get back you
29845140	29847140	Give me some of that
29847380	29851740	Good day for catching up on cooking balls and things and no engineering. Yeah
29851780	29858620	And so the clipping situation I don't want the girls feeling stressed out thinking like I have to clip like and stream at
29858620	29862140	The same time and like deal with all this and try and do collabs all the girls and all that
29862660	29866380	And deal with the audios and blah blah blah. So I don't want to stress them out
29866540	29870660	So when you guys like do a make a YouTube clip
29870660	29875940	I can go on their accounts and see what someone's clipped and if it is like clippable
29875940	29880500	Where's a I can then send the timestamp onto like an actual clip editor
29881500	29888900	To make clips for them and I just need to see how it works out in theory obviously when I do endured streams
29888900	29891420	I can't do any of it like right now for them and
29893580	29895580	But we
29895860	29897540	Will see how it goes
29897540	29903140	I don't know if I need to like put out a little ad saying like I need more clippers of this particular style
29903700	29906500	Because there's a particular clipping editing style
29907100	29912340	That I'm looking for the most recent mercy shorts the blonde hair short
29913220	29915060	and the other
29915060	29917060	short of forgotten
29918100	29923260	And is the clipping style so if you really can do that in style
29923940	29925940	You know, don't be afraid to help the website
29927660	29930580	Because that's kind of what I'm needing at this point
29931260	29933260	Good thing. I've got a few clips already
29933300	29940260	My job is not necessary. If you're a general clipper and we do I'm still interested in doing the clipping
29940340	29942820	Enterprise that like I don't end on which is really good
29943580	29949260	Obviously need to get monetized first and set up and see whether my funds and the money looks like and all that and
29950740	29956380	Because will I tell you a really embarrassing fact, you know the earlier like
29959140	29961140	The earlier
29961340	29964760	Clips that came out shorts that were on the girls channels
29965460	29966420	and
29966420	29969940	Amy made two of her a couple of shorts on her own actually
29970340	29975860	But I was editing them and I hated them so much and I was so embarrassed. I was like, I'm so sorry girls
29975860	29983260	This is the best I can do because we had a quite a few issues behind the scenes production wise with timing
29983260	29985260	It was a freaking nightmare
29985540	29986900	and
29986900	29989540	so like all my attention was elsewhere and
29990140	29995300	Like I didn't have time to be like hi clippers. Here's this these files like please wait at them
29997140	30002660	Which that's where I did fail like looking back like obviously I'm happy like talk about like where I failed the girls and like I
30002660	30009700	Definitely feel like I've failed with them on the clips because the actual plan was the count school life for two weeks
30010420	30014980	before stream and there'll be a clip uploaded every day and
30015660	30020340	Like I kind of failed the girls like doing that and I feel really bad about it. I feel wrong
30022220	30027220	But like the dust is kind of set of already done this but the dust is like kind of settling
30031700	30039540	The only bad thing is that for now time zone only you and I see stream at normal times, okay, you may be not in a normal way. Yeah
30045700	30047700	You
30050140	30054900	Do you know like it definitely went well like the absolutely no denying like
30060540	30064720	And I'm definitely not denying like
30066460	30068460	debut went well and everything
30068740	30076220	Just like I had planned things to just be a lot better and obviously it's not realistic to be like all my plans are all
30076220	30080500	I just realized I need to leave the face. We're gonna be jumping off this building for quite well
30082140	30085100	Like I understand it's not possible for everything
30087060	30090740	For everything to like come out the way of my head and
30091740	30095460	Like the girls trailers didn't come out the way I wanted them to
30096380	30104060	And but because of like production issues, I couldn't get things like fixed or altered in time for anything really and it was just like
30106060	30108060	But yeah
30108460	30112860	Yeah, are you winning strong? Yeah, absolutely. Um, are you winning?
30115540	30119820	Excuse me, I'm using this cable. I'm so sorry if this makes anyone motion sick
30119820	30125340	I'm needing to do leaps of faith and if you jump off a pigeon thing it counts as a leap of faith
30125980	30128700	No, it's ill into the hay bed
30129580	30132380	No, it's ill into the hay bed
30135460	30143180	Yeah, it was a timing issue and we love artists in this house we do but and I
30144260	30145860	had given
30145900	30153220	Very I feel I had gave incredibly fair deadlines for what I was asking and
30155260	30162740	Pretty much across the board the majority went over and if you are an artist that worked with me
30162740	30165740	And you did go over deadline like please don't worry and
30166500	30173420	Like it's not like a big deal anymore because obviously now everything's out there and everything's all good and we debuted and like that's
30173420	30174980	That's the facts
30174980	30176980	but I
30177180	30179180	had a lot of delays and
30181220	30183820	Basically, I had planned every month in advance
30184660	30189980	Being like this month. I'll be focused on this this month. I'll be focused on that and what happened was
30191660	30194380	Everything had to be done in May and
30195500	30197100	Like I'm not gonna lie
30197100	30203900	I like cried a few times out of just like pure frustration of like feeling I can't do enough
30204300	30206300	because I have to wait for
30207180	30214020	Someone to send something back in order for me to progress and give feedback like I had a lot of
30215660	30217660	Like issues with
30218180	30225300	People not checking what they gave me the first time around and being like hey the reference sheet looks like this or hey
30226260	30231340	Like the subtitle that you put here and like it's quite clear that she didn't say this
30231340	30235580	But you've literally put it in for some reason or like hey the audio
30236100	30239940	Literally cuts out in the middle of this. Can you re-render like I don't know what like
30240500	30242500	it was
30242660	30250020	It was rubbish and at the same time like obviously the girls know a bit more in detail exactly what I'm talking about and
30250540	30252780	Because like I showed them like we are
30254020	30260220	Like I'm constantly sending back like please fix this please fix this please fix this and the days are going by and the
30260220	30265700	Fixes are taking 24 hours the fixes aren't done within 20 minutes and I get a new rendered version of something
30265700	30271940	It's like no 24 hours. I'll do it in the morning. I'll do it later, and I'm like I have paid premium rates
30271940	30278980	I shouldn't be the one who is quality checking your work. You should quality check it before you send it to me and
30280060	30284420	Like it was just a cascading effect, and it was pretty horrible
30285340	30286540	And
30286540	30292300	But yeah, but we're here now. So and there were so many lessons learned like
30294220	30301380	Rip to future artists if you're interested in working with Veeler, but like everyone's getting contracts like conscripted and stuff like
30303740	30307380	And being like if you miss this deadline like you know
30307900	30309140	it's
30309140	30315540	Just there's just it's not fun being like that like I love giving artists the benefit of the doubt
30315540	30318700	But holy is this even counting for leaps of faith?
30320460	30322260	Yeah
30322260	30325220	Like deadlines are so important and having that like
30326500	30331260	My heck are the leaps of faith here. Oh, wow. We're one off of leaf of faith
30333820	30338300	Literally in the end we made it everything worked out fight. Wait, did that guard hurt himself?
30339620	30341980	and
30341980	30345340	Like we made it in the end, but yeah rough rough
30345940	30347940	Not fun, but I'm now
30348300	30352620	Like I just want to stream. I just want to have fun. I want to show off my games. I want to have a good time
30352620	30355180	I want to make ASMR. I want to do everything that I wanted to do
30355860	30359020	While I get to do it alongside like these amazing girls type thing
30359020	30365340	And I want them to see them achieve their dreams and see how it goes like obviously the the the current goal is
30365340	30368540	YouTube to please stop calling us and like admit that we're real
30369140	30372340	Like streamers and stuff. You don't need to call us like there's plenty of content
30373380	30375140	On channels now
30375140	30379180	But yeah, like it definitely like everything works out in the end
30380980	30383460	Absolutely is everyone max level
30386140	30387500	No
30387500	30391100	Three people aren't max. Oh, I didn't mean to do that by a whole
30392380	30394380	Yeah, like the worst part is over
30395100	30397100	Wait what the heck
30397140	30399140	Oopsies, I'm to kill
30399820	30401340	the mailman
30401340	30409660	Not to be confused with the Sandman that blows literal dust over your eyelashes or some shiz. I was ridiculous
30410700	30415860	Never heard of the first time I've ever heard of that nonsense before I heard this song
30416580	30418580	But like what?
30424020	30426020	For goodness sake
30428100	30430100	I
30434460	30436460	Love how easy that stuff is
30438620	30441940	Oh, excuse me, am I not your mentor?
30446740	30451620	Oh, no, the PayPal got fixed and so you can support any of the girls like right now
30451620	30456380	I think I need to update my link or something because people say it no work or something
30457100	30459100	I don't know
30460780	30462780	Oh, you're using the new info
30464060	30470500	YouTube on soft as it's old European folklore, of course, it's nonsense. True a
30472820	30474820	Literary tree
30475780	30479620	Right, I don't really know what the plan is
30480380	30491260	Okay, we'll finish the guild people's requests, but I have to admit I'm a bit lost on what next to do
30499420	30504820	Get all the guild crests by everything and then I think we might be done maybe the feathers
30505660	30507660	And
30507700	30509700	And we'll revisit
30513260	30515260	Mercy 30 minute
30517860	30520300	Did I get the feather from this location I must go
30522100	30524100	You did
30524980	30526980	Cause a little chaos why not
30529900	30534100	Christina, oh I forgot about Christina. Oh, right. Okay. Okay. Okay
30535780	30537780	Oh

30543020	30545020	Wait, so what's my DNA?
30546460	30549420	Must be high enough seriously 68
30551500	30553500	Is there anything I could do that's really easy
30556540	30558540	No, no
30565540	30568580	I don't want to do do you know be to take it
30576220	30579340	Wait a minute did this one
30589860	30593580	That was rubbish that one don't look I discovered no that was rubbish as well
30595740	30602660	That was rubbish as well rubbish and maybe the missions
30611860	30613860	I've never achieved that
30617980	30620780	No, these like so aren't possible
30621020	30624220	Well, maybe I need to do
30626980	30629380	Wait the assassinations are only a oh
30630940	30633940	The assassinations are like only a 41
30637740	30644620	Okay, okay, we'll do assassins that'll raise us that'll raise us really quickly like they're super easy super nice and consider it
30646340	30648340	So we'll do that
30651180	30653180	I

30665700	30667940	Y'all excited for my first day some ice cream
30669500	30671500	I'm doing something
30671580	30675980	Mildly special in it. I'm a bit concerned after what happened to me, but he will

30722900	30725220	Wait, does that mean like don't get detected?
30726460	30732300	She had to fall and land on her ear somehow. Yeah, I remember reading someone's review on it and I was like
30732980	30737180	Now I want all my children to succeed
30738060	30740060	but apparently
30741500	30745300	Apparently we were spitting and licking it back up
30746700	30753180	How do you plead to these accusations? I mean, how do you plead to such accusations?
30759140	30761140	Actually
30762060	30763420	Pin pals
30763420	30770020	How do you plead to the accusations that you egged your little sister on?
30771380	30774260	To do such devious acts
30774260	30776260	I

30869820	30878740	No, how dare you labeling on the innocent the innocent turn yet it because that's what the name of her
30880340	30882340	So true
30882820	30884820	She's always egging his own
30888580	30894260	Right, I'm gonna send away those assassins that aren't ready to level out properly
30896100	30901460	Thank you, I'll send you on a big big contract big big big big contract
30903180	30908660	One two three four five of you
30913700	30917500	She turned a guy into a tree like he was asking for okay
30918980	30923140	She needs to level up. Okay. She needs to be experienced with what she's doing
30924260	30926260	It's not hurtful
30926500	30931140	Right, we seem to be about 42 percent use assassin recruits to assist in uh
30931700	30933540	diversion
30933540	30935540	Kill the merchant while remaining undetected
30936740	30938740	He's peasy lemme squee
30940580	30942580	Gotta get that xp somehow
30942980	30944980	You know what you're right. Her latest
30945300	30949860	Alt tweet probably is a misunderstanding exactly. You're just reading it wrong, okay
30953300	30955300	Uh
30956020	30958020	Can I like lock on to the guy
30964740	30966740	Well, let me recall my recruit
30969780	30971780	Is it bugged out? Oh
30975220	30976340	Oh
30976340	30981300	Wait, what was the mission use the session recruits to assist tonight diversion
30985780	30987460	Oh, well
30987460	30989860	That was easy peasy lemons wheezy. What's going on here?
30991540	30993620	We are discussing how
30994900	30997300	Pin pals have you so misunderstood
30998660	31000820	They're looking at you with
31000820	31002820	This
31014180	31015380	They do
31015380	31020980	I'm trying to tell them that you're innocent. Okay, and that they're not comprehending
31022020	31028340	That the you jumping up and down on the bed during your ASMR stream is completely innocent
31028740	31032420	And you were literally just singing that song
31033540	31039620	Three little monkeys jumping in the bed one fell off and bumped its head first game the doctor or something
31041540	31043540	That's not anything fun though. Sure
31046980	31048980	All right, I don't get
31052100	31054100	We'll do the feathers
31058340	31060340	I'm not innocent. That's for e
31069220	31071860	Who among us is innocent truly? No
31074020	31076740	If I were making an among us reference that it means Lord there
31077540	31080580	I was like, did you like that? Uh, and wait, I don't need to go off on it. Okay
31088340	31090340	I
31095860	31102900	Really suck out of this, you know, it has potential don't tell me otherwise. I won't accept such
31105860	31108100	Right, you need to jump up here in order to get this flag
31109780	31113700	I need them to come across more thieves to do the lure. I think I have like two more
31114420	31118180	Thieves need to lure the guards away. I'm sad. I missed on these. I mean
31119060	31121060	I don't good
31123060	31125060	It means probably gonna do it
31125460	31127460	And ASMR streaming in
31128740	31131700	Just uh, maybe a little less
31133860	31135860	Uh a little less, perhaps
31137540	31139540	You know
31139540	31141540	We can't escape
31142260	31146740	V suck it could be another brand of ruler. It should be for the the innocent
31148660	31150740	The innocent side where I just make them do like
31151300	31158100	Girlfriend roleplay audios or like that kind of stuff. But like it's nothing. It doesn't like go any further, you know
31161860	31166020	Safer work side that people have been asking for I did get a few emails
31166500	31167860	um
31167860	31172660	Management showed me them and people were like, uh, is it required to do that?
31173460	31175460	and it was like
31176100	31181620	Very sadly kind of the the whole point of the agency. Um, that's where the money is
31185060	31190660	Oh, oh wait. No, there's not boarder people here anymore. I was getting nervous. So I was gonna get caught and I'm like, wait, man
31190660	31192660	There's no boarder
31193300	31195300	Oh
31195380	31197380	Eye contact roleplay
31198260	31203060	Teaching you eye contact proof. Oh, I don't know the best way to climb this. Maybe on the outside of the policy
31207700	31209700	Give me that feather
31212580	31214180	True love
31214180	31216180	Ruffin
31217620	31221380	Yeah, like so I did have a few variations of like
31222180	31226100	Would there ever be a generation that didn't require that part and it's like
31228420	31231460	What's the point? It's just a really agency at that point
31234340	31235540	Um
31235540	31237540	Where the height was that other feather?
31238420	31240340	Oh, it's literally
31240340	31242340	split perfectly
31242500	31244500	Uh, where there is the
31245220	31250340	Jump off point. Oh wait. We have a parachute. All right. We'll just use the parachute off the coliseum
31250580	31252580	I
31256740	31259860	Come pop off in real food where you can hear audible call. Oh, and me
31266340	31268340	All right, we're just gonna do this
31272180	31274180	Your assassins
31275140	31277140	You
31278660	31282580	There's a few uh group roleplay is actually seventh as well. I'm coming out
31283860	31291060	Uh, I just can't any time to settle. I only want them to come out once the culling has stopped because literally it's like such a
31292260	31294260	shame
31294260	31296260	That it is still happening
31297060	31303060	Even though like we're like getting into the studio. It's like, yeah, we've like got proper streams now. So I'm not really sure what the deal is
31304340	31309220	Like the meme asmr's are literally i'm too scared to even upload them at this point because i'm like
31309220	31315300	What's going on with asmr? I think there may have been a stealth policy update or it's about to be introduced publicly
31316740	31318740	Feathers up here. Um
31324340	31331220	This is a little sister you argued has an innocent mind. Yeah, I'm not arguing in what's innocent of
31334900	31337380	Okay, right. We're gonna use the
31341380	31347060	Yeah, there's definitely something going on at youtube headquarters when it comes to asmr because
31348340	31354020	There's a lot of channels left and right getting yanked for content that previously was fine
31354740	31356340	and they're
31356340	31360820	my guess is that youtube don't want to publicly say it because
31361460	31366420	Asmr is such a popular category on youtube like it's an insanely popular category
31366980	31369060	And they don't want to come out and say it
31369860	31373620	So they're just tackling it like silently basically
31375220	31377220	So it's not arguing
31378420	31380420	um
31380660	31386180	I think I think the uproar if they publicly said like we're doing this would be so much because asmr
31386260	31389140	I think they like said it's like one of the top four categories
31389940	31396180	Sorry, like in the top 10 searches a variation of either like food eating or asmr medicines
31396660	31399140	Like whatever you want to kind of really get into it
31400020	31400980	um
31400980	31402900	It's like such a high
31402900	31407460	Watched category that if they publicly said like hey, we're drawing the line here now
31408180	31410740	I do think there will be a post at some point
31411140	31416100	But at the moment it's kind of stealthily being done. So the content is no longer
31416740	31424420	Available. So when they do go publicly like hey, we've actually changed this people are like, oh, that's fine
31424660	31430420	Because like no one's been uploading it anyway because you know, you've been deleting channels less than right and
31431140	31433140	Handing out warnings willy-nilly. So
31434260	31435620	Yeah
31435620	31441460	That's my guess by the way. This is absolutely not factual. This is like just what my genuine like
31442180	31444180	What I think is going on
31444420	31446020	um
31446420	31453060	YouTube is just like I see. Yeah, it's literally just my guess what's going on. It seems the most probable to me
31454580	31456580	um
31456980	31463700	So unfortunately, I think like you're looking content's just gonna have to be like
31465620	31467780	Just straight up upload it to twitter or
31469300	31471300	Put on patreon
31471860	31473860	Yeah
31475460	31482260	Solution and I know a lot of people are like, oh like just put it like not behind a paywall on patreon
31482900	31486100	Unfortunately in order to link your patreon successfully
31487220	31489460	Um everything must be behind the paywall
31491300	31495380	First like even if it's a fine audio that is not wrong with it
31496580	31499300	Um, it has to all be behind a paywall. It's bizarre
31500260	31504100	It's bizarre the rules get very arbitrary in memoria
31506740	31508740	Now you're wrong YouTube's drunk
31514420	31520260	All right, let me see we've done the feathers. I have no idea how many
31522180	31526580	We've done right we're getting close to doing the courtesans
31529300	31531300	So
31531620	31533620	Yeah, like we're so
31534980	31543460	Uh enemy stations, right we're gonna do that now because I know how to do that. You have to replay a memory
31544740	31546340	from
31546340	31548340	the french one
31550740	31552740	No
31555380	31557380	Yes, this is the one
31557860	31561460	Can you stream to x? I wouldn't stream on twitter
31562660	31564660	No, you need money on it
31565940	31570660	Like I hate to I hate to be that one. I know it sounds really sucky where it's like money money money, but it's like the
31571460	31575300	Obviously the girl's name is ported and the thing with youtube boards is like
31575940	31580260	Uh, you always like make money on youtube boards and like always look up and yeah
31581460	31584580	Once inside your men can overpower the camps patrols, correct?
31585460	31590900	Yes, I think it's fine saying like yes, we're not an agency for greed, but at the end of the day
31592580	31594580	We need money around
31594580	31602020	And the youtube boards is like a fantastic way or the youtube ads on like a small video for example
31602900	31607220	Like this kind of stuff is like free to make content like it's free for me to stream right now, you know
31607300	31613140	My troops will gather it from the dead and people underestimate the value of ad revenue the uh
31613620	31615620	Advertise like the free
31617220	31619220	The armor has to stay clean
31621380	31629300	Right if you use your crossbow ball in this mission it accepts that last thing like oh, there's a horse right there
31629860	31631860	Oh, there's another horse right there
31632420	31634420	Yeah
31635860	31640020	Businesses move can't do everything for you. Unfortunately, yes, the world is run on
31642420	31645060	All right, I'm not going now because really peace forever to get to these guys there
31646100	31649540	Um, we'll go this way instead. Yeah, this way's like so much better
31650580	31654420	You basically for some reason if you snipe the guys in this one
31655300	31657060	um
31657060	31662260	They count towards that cortisone thing, but if you snipe in general it doesn't count
31662980	31664980	Oh sugar. I'm sorry
31665140	31667140	No, I didn't want to do that
31670100	31676500	Actually, hold on hold on when the disarm and kill with his own weapon. There we go one of five
31677460	31679460	I don't know
31681460	31685300	99% of all my problems come silver money. It is a terrible way
31691540	31692900	Okay
31692900	31698500	We might have to do this twice twice. I'm not sure. Well that guy's coming over to investigate right here
31699540	31701540	Another free kill
31701780	31704420	Is that guy coming to investigate? Oh these guys are
31705380	31707380	I'll take it
31711860	31714500	I will loot them just so I can get some of them back
31719060	31721060	And that's how the next one might be
31722980	31728340	We appreciate that thing but please do always consider supporting the girls
31728420	31736900	We should get crossbow bolts from this. Okay hydration check hydration check. I've been yammering but I've not had much water today
31742580	31746420	I don't know when we can submit for monetization yet
31747780	31753140	As I said the stats like are not updating so it's kind of just uh
31753860	31755860	I
31756420	31758420	Very casually like
31758820	31763300	Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Okay. I'm gonna help
31764820	31766820	I'm calling the assassins and
31769940	31773460	Oh, I just teabagged him as he died. Okay, that was rather unique
31775940	31778980	Let's not do that again. That was uh, really not a move
31784100	31789940	But yes, once the youtube calling stops then please do look around uh for
31790980	31793860	Very fun ASMR collabs coming out. Um
31796980	31801140	Very very large ASMR collabs that cost a lot of money put together by hey-ho. Um
31807940	31811540	Um, sorry, I'm like trying to bramble and think and
31813300	31815300	Get this done
31819220	31822580	I like how he's suspicious even though I literally just perished that guy right there
31827940	31830260	God I wish there was a way to pay for all the girls patrons
31830260	31835700	I once I just got 16 months back to back. Oh, you support them as patrons. Thank you so much. That's very kind of you
31835860	31839540	Thank you. Yes, actually special. Thank you to literally
31840020	31841140	um
31841140	31846980	Anyone who's supported the girls on patreon. I understand the patrons will have one audio and it's very kind of you to like
31847620	31849620	um
31849620	31852660	You know reach out and do that even there's literally one audio
31853380	31857300	There are coming because the audio is released on the first
31857940	31862500	The girls are gonna have a consistent day that their audio in particular comes out
31862580	31865300	I really hope this is counting towards the challenge actually
31866660	31868660	um
31869700	31871700	I think this
31871940	31873940	Grave I'm having to go all the way around
31882260	31886980	That was it right I just need to redo that and then I think that'll be it for the mission
31887620	31890100	For the the crotch is on
31891060	31892260	right, let me just
31892260	31895780	Check the DNA sequence. I say that as I literally just goes that
31896500	31899620	That should have counted quite a bit towards that one
31902740	31904740	Two
31907460	31909460	That came it is two
31911620	31913620	Oh
31914820	31919620	Why did that not work is it because I kept getting detected
31922420	31924420	Oh brother
31926340	31928340	Oh
31928660	31932500	Guards on horseback air so guards killed well on a horseback
31937860	31939860	PayPal guards I need to go all the way
31942660	31946900	Guards air assassinate from a beam actually we're closer to getting the thieves done
31948340	31950340	I need to find a beam. I don't know where the beam is
31950980	31952980	Yeah
31954580	31956980	The mercenaries one is like absolute killer
31957860	31961780	So you go patreoner just paid for you. Oh, thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it
31963860	31965860	Y'all are I expected way more hate
31967540	31972100	Honestly, I think we all did but like I think everyone's just on the same page of like, yeah
31972980	31978660	You're probably tired at this point of like your vtuber just like teasing and teasing and then never giving anything
31979540	31982740	And then it's like, yeah, we're just having a good time meemen
31983380	31986740	If you want the goods, you know where they are. If you don't there's also free stuff coming out
31987460	31989460	a free video game coming out
31989540	31991540	like, uh, yeah
31991860	31995860	I think it probably helps without the greed out. I think if it was like a greedy
31996340	31998900	looking corporation that probably wouldn't help
31999700	32001700	but it's like, yeah, everyone's just
32002740	32006900	Right, I'm gonna bump into guards and they'd run away from them and hide in spots
32007620	32008660	Great
32008660	32011060	We'll do the bump because there's a hay bale right here
32011780	32013780	Hey, excuse me. Don't you be?
32013780	32016900	Oh sugar. Oh, uh, I don't think I can hide in this
32017860	32020420	Okay, let's see how
32021780	32023780	Can I hide now?
32025860	32030660	Oh, oh no, oh no, they're right next to me
32031460	32037860	No, don't check it. Don't check it. Don't check it. Don't check it. Don't check it
32041380	32048900	That shouldn't happen. Oh, there's more guards up here. I thought this district was like there's no guards here at all
32048900	32050900	Oh
32056900	32058900	Oh, yes the bench the bench of safety
32059540	32064260	Okay, I can't go on the bench because it's not like oh for goodness sake. How many of you?
32066900	32069460	Oh, right. I'm hiding in here can't get me
32073220	32075220	Does that count
32075380	32080180	Did it count you seem to be still annoyed at me?
32081060	32083460	I'm just gonna check that counted because if it does
32084500	32090820	Uh, not the poking if that did count. I'm literally just gonna keep upsetting those guards over and over to do that again and again
32092820	32094820	I think it should have counted those
32094820	32100820	I did right time to keep bumping into them. I'm gonna kill this guard up here though because he's gonna keep ruining it
32101780	32103780	Oh
32104180	32106180	Yeah
32122260	32127620	You smell so bad. No, you have to chase me
32130820	32132820	Miss me miss me now you have to kiss me
32134580	32136580	I was supposed to jump up
32140660	32142660	Where's the bail hey, oh there is

32179620	32181620	Oh
32185860	32190980	I'm not sure that counted he was like so close you guys should know
32193380	32199860	No, I'm sorry, please excuse me. Ah, please excuse me. I'm scared. There's a table in the way. I got nervous. I'm sorry
32202740	32205140	Oh, no, I can't climb this way. Okay, he jumped on again
32205380	32207380	Ah
32207700	32211620	He's got a long lens. Please leave me alone. Let me out
32215860	32217860	Jump
32220340	32224340	They're like instantly given up. I'm like really worried that's not counting but
32229060	32232260	No, it is it just doesn't look like it looks so silly
32235780	32238980	And mercy online heck yeah mercies online. Let's go
32241860	32243620	Uh

32255700	32261860	Uh, I think we're gonna wrap up the guild challenge. Oh, it's seal. It's supposed to go in the hair bill
32262580	32264580	Oh
32264900	32266900	See in the flip
32273940	32275940	Can you hear that or am I going crazy?
32279940	32281940	Am I going
32285300	32290340	Did I hear that right? Yeah, okay. I'm good. I was like, um, are you all hearing nothing?
32292580	32294580	Well, literally
32295700	32300180	I wonder if it's leftover ambience from the party sequence with the banker
32302100	32304100	Last one
32305620	32307620	Okay
32309140	32313380	I hear it again. Is there like people here or is it just SFX?
32315860	32317860	More like SFX
32318660	32320660	Yeah
32320980	32324260	Yeah, there's not even coded people to be here. I must just be background ambience
32325300	32328260	That's leftover from the party sequence with the bankers
32330340	32334020	All right, let's get notoriety down a little bit because guards are getting really worse
32336260	32342180	They're still asked it literally the party ended many a day ago. They just played operation
32342740	32346580	Hmm crazy, that's crazy right
32348900	32353940	I'm starting to get a bit delirious. Oh, I must switch the body though
32368100	32370100	I don't know why that did so little
32372180	32374180	I
32377140	32384100	Watching all the girls straight a long watch starting to move off isn't it not too much noise like there's too much noise going on
32388340	32390340	We're all blabbing away at once
32390500	32403060	I'm not sure what to do. I'm kind of getting I'm not like stuck. I know we can do those things
32403220	32406500	I'm just like, I don't know where the beam is for what we want to do
32409940	32411940	Um
32414660	32416820	I'm just like
32416820	32419540	Do we call it and then the next thing come on
32420340	32425780	I'm not gonna I like I'm like I'm saying to myself. I'm I'm gonna be annoyed at myself if I call it right now
32426500	32427700	is one
32427700	32429060	think I'm
32429060	32431060	I think I'm in back yet
32432100	32434100	Oh 19 seconds to come back
32436580	32441220	Right, let me find a group of thieves to hire at least so I can get rid of that
32445140	32448180	I can only focus it's hard to multitask that I'm watchable script right
32450660	32453700	But mercy live if anyone would like to watch mercy modis
32456180	32461300	Oh, I saw that. Okay, there are there are thieves somewhere on the verse up here
32465220	32467220	No
32467220	32469220	I see why they fear you
32471860	32473860	I'm forcing
32474260	32476260	Um
32476500	32477860	I
32477860	32485140	Think for simplicity will just teleport to the thieves guild in order to hire them. I struggle so much to find thieves
32485140	32487140	I understand their own rooftops
32487220	32489220	But they make it so freaking hard
32490100	32491700	run wads
32491700	32494500	Run wads of all six at once and let it just fry your brain
32495860	32497860	Most of it's four, but only one audio
32498260	32503380	Yeah, like I understand maybe for like a collab stream you like meet everyone but one person and then get to see everyone's POV
32506740	32513860	Mmm, I have teleport to the wrong place. I was not paying attention. I apologize. Oh wait, there's somewhere I can buy hello
32514580	32516580	Would you like to be purchased?
32520180	32524260	It would be a shame not to do Christina though like we're actually so close
32527140	32529140	Ah
32529860	32532020	What's the percentage we need for Christina?
32536820	32538820	Oh
32539140	32542340	Why is your accent so cool sponding Scotland?
32543460	32544900	and
32544900	32546900	always be scottish
32546900	32550740	It's very hard to unlearn that accent. Hmm. I even think it's possible
32552740	32554740	Truly out there now
32555060	32560660	Um, why was I here again? Oh to hire thieves and there's literally no thieves hanging out here
32561300	32567060	I need to hire one group of thieves. Is this for real for real like for real for real?
32569780	32574260	Uh, well, I need to find a beam that enemies pass over
32576260	32580420	And it's kind of in these general area. I'm uh
32583700	32587700	Unbelievably I'm at 69 percent. Um
32591620	32593460	Like
32593460	32595460	I don't know why
32595540	32602980	Locate memory in world insufficient data to access locate memory in world go to memory start point to synchronize with animals
32604180	32606180	Gotta go to work have fun at work
32606820	32609620	If you could have any other accent, what would it be?
32610180	32612180	Ah
32616180	32623060	Copernacle might have a lot of percentage in it. That's missing. We'll do Copernacle. Um as for accent
32628500	32630740	Can't imagine myself wearing her now. So honestly
32631620	32633620	Like to pick one
32633620	32635620	The Italian accent can be really nice
32635940	32641060	Although the Japanese like but Japanese voices are like so nice and like pitched
32642180	32648020	Um, which I really enjoy but I guess it's pitching no actual good boy
32651860	32653860	Uh
32653940	32655940	Her accent
32657140	32659700	Honestly, I don't actually mind
32660340	32661700	a
32661700	32663700	Polish accent if you've ever
32663860	32668340	Listen to a sweet Polish accent. It can actually be really soothing. Um
32669780	32676340	Just a little a little hint of uh their words and that's pretty good. Apply the Scottish accent to any language
32678820	32680820	Oh, you might apply to it
32683780	32685780	It calvane
32687380	32689380	It will sex
32689620	32691620	I
32691940	32693940	Was he believed
32695780	32697780	Volgmae
32698180	32700180	That's Scottish touch
32701300	32703300	That's pretty awful
32704420	32711140	Pretty rough pretty rough right. We'll try Copernacle, but if this doesn't like dramatically raise the DNA
32712020	32714500	Think I'm gonna I think I'm perishing
32716420	32718420	Unfortunately
32719460	32721460	And it might be wiser to
32722020	32724500	redirect into mercy and kind of have a break and
32725140	32731860	Deal with uh, these a smart collage and see what I'm looking at because I think someone might be waiting on me to edit
32740020	32742020	Scottish is the best accent as much as I was
32742020	32749380	Who is this man? He comes from Russia. I hear studies at the body count, but his words are unlike any that issue from that place
32750580	32752580	I don't buy it for Scottish accent's first
32753540	32756740	Scottish is magical hearing German speaking with songs that weird
32760180	32763380	You know, you have a good source accent when people can't even understand you
32763940	32766580	Perhaps to disguise a myriad of contradictions
32767540	32773620	I could use an excuse to go to bed. Yeah, I'm kind of like I think I'm actually lagging. I can't believe it. You're injured
32774420	32779700	Me saying I'm an endurance streamer. I'm a liar. The master wants all the scholars silence by nightfall
32779940	32781940	How long did we make it?
32782980	32784980	And so am I
32787540	32790660	Take no damage during the ambush right get the wee knife
32792820	32794820	Two minutes
32796980	32798980	Let's get to me nice
32800500	32802500	No
32802500	32807460	Yeah, that's what am I I'm gonna call in two of my assassins
32811140	32814660	No, it was like way too early that you saw the way he was wiggling that knife up
32818660	32822900	Whoa, why are you you know the guy that's like right in front of us maybe focus on like
32823460	32825460	Oh
32826020	32828020	Okay
32828020	32833060	Okay, my assassins are sticking around which I'm quite happy about I don't want to call in the last batch of assassins
32834180	32836180	just because
32839460	32845780	If they kill them too fast, they actually might all be spawned and not help me at all, which is quite funny to think about
32846100	32852980	I do wish citizens would stop running into the middle of the fight or near it. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Don't hurt me, please
32854180	32856180	If I take no damage, I win
32859940	32861380	Oh
32861380	32866820	I'm scared. He's got such a long freaking pole. He's gonna hit me with it
32870980	32873460	My assassin is trying to chase them but it's not happening
32876340	32883860	I'm just hiding. I'm letting my assassins do it. Copernico is fine. His health bar is fine
32888340	32890340	Oh, I've got fun. Oh, they caught me
32892340	32901700	Uh, I don't want to get hit. I'm so close to doing no hit. Please. Please. Please. Please. Literally 13 seconds is all I ask
32902340	32906100	Don't change up. Don't do anything else
32908100	32910100	Four more seconds
32911700	32913700	Okay, we did it
32914100	32918580	We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it
32918740	32923140	I think we came to do it. I'm still running away in case it counts. I think it counts
32923220	32928180	So I'm just gonna keep running running and running in circles around the fountain
32929220	32931220	Okay
32932660	32936340	Yeah, that's right. I did that
32949460	32951460	Right, I have terrible news
32951940	32958020	Fake endurance streamer. Absolutely horrible news 100% poggers. Yay. You said 100%
32958020	32960020	Wooo
32960340	32965700	Now we may genuinely return to brotherhood again at a later date. Um
32966660	32971060	But I'm actually quite satisfied. Literally, we did the campaign. We've done all the dlc stuff now
32972340	32974500	You did that so hard that other people didn't
32976980	32978980	Strolling it if you don't finish it just
32979700	32984260	Means you need to do it. Yes. I actually wouldn't mind revisiting it at a later date
32984260	32989620	I would like to play a bit more variety at this point. Um, I'm going to redirect into
32990420	32991780	um
32991780	32993780	Mercy so we can all enjoy her
32994340	32998100	I I can't believe it. I'm not a real endurance streamer. I only lasted
32998820	33004180	Nine hours this time. Gee willacrus. Oh, I'm kind of basic
33005060	33007060	I can't believe it
33008020	33010020	Oh
33010100	33016180	Uh, please do consider giving a like and a subscribe. Uh, if you enjoyed youtube may have unscripted
33017620	33021140	But don't worry. Uh, I'm going to redirect you an emergency
33022740	33024740	An emergency
33026100	33032900	Uh, redirect select stream. Oh, she's playing. Oh morey. Oh morey
33034020	33036020	That's oh morey
33036740	33038260	When
33038260	33039860	mercy, please
33039860	33041860	The tippy tippy day
33043620	33045620	That's pretty good. Yeah, that's pretty good
33056260	33061060	I got a copyright on my assassin's creed playthrough a game yesterday
33061860	33068100	Uh, sorry, I just spotted that right now and I'm like, uh, what I apologize. Uh, thank you
33068580	33071300	So so much my lovely beeflings for watching
33072020	33076100	Um, literally, I just I just checked it out. I'm like, I'm pretty sure the game has no copyright
33076260	33081300	So it's a false copyright thing going on. But thank you so so much for hanging out. Uh,
33082100	33085780	Yeah, maybe not 100 for the first time, but we'll give it a shot
33085780	33088660	I think we'll come back and we'll feel refreshed at a later date
33089060	33093460	Um, because that was a lot of jumping about. I think that's brought 20 hours
33094100	33100260	Combined at this point. Um, so thank you so so much for hanging. Uh, tomorrow we're playing needy streamer overload
33100340	33102340	I haven't played it
33102500	33105460	So i'm not quite sure what to expect but is a shorter stream for me
33106020	33111780	Um, so for those of you like the endurance side of things, I apologize, but my stamina is lacking tomorrow
33112180	33115940	Um, but nevertheless is always fantastic. Thank you so so much
33116420	33120180	My little reeflings or those who are watching and I will
33121380	33125220	See you tomorrow and say hi to mersey. I will talk
33125380	33129940	I will talk in mersey's chat for a little bit, but uh, I do need to go for a big pee
33130260	33132900	Um, I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise and you may pass
33133540	33136040	So I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye. Bye
33136040	33138040	Bye
33142760	33144760	Bye. Bye now see you tomorrow
