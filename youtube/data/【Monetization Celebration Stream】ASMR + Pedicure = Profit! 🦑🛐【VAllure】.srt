00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Oh, Bay Odex, Plastic Ghost.

107
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,720
I'm not going to actually have to do ASMR between them.

108
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Oh my god, hold on.

109
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
There's a few tools like all that are like required,

110
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,720
real ambidextrous, but like crack pipes,

111
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,720
come on, oh shit.

112
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Hold on, hold on, I can do this.

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm actually having a problem with this toe, by the way.

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,720
I don't know what the lady did, but I think it's contracted

115
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
and I might have to go with the doctor about it,

116
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
because something's not right.

117
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,720
I cleaned the wound today,

118
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
and something's definitely not right,

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,720
but can we even get it to bloop?

120
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Wait, hold on.

121
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
It's not blooping.

122
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
I can't do this.

123
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,720
It's a crazy amount of team effort to get this to bloop.

124
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Hold on.

125
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Oh, come on.

126
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,720
It's not turning over because of the way my feet are.

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Oh my god, I figured it out.

128
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Oh my god, a little toe just cracked.

129
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Oh shit.

130
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm going to be sorry if I get my dissent today.

131
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
That took me so long.

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
I also brought pop rocks to prove how sweaty my feet are.

133
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
I want to see if my feet sweat, can make them pop,

134
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,720
although just the feet sweat, nothing else.

135
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I just realized I'm really covering that up,

136
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
so let me go over here.

137
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Look, it's my feet.

138
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Oh yeah, I also have a PC cleaner.

139
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,720
These are used for fan board type things,

140
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
but you need to squeeze them to get the air out.

141
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,720
So yeah, I brought a lot of tools to try and get rid of the freaking feet.

142
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,720
I also got the frog thing.

143
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
It goes like...

144
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Yeah, it's into the frog.

145
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I ain't working that one, hold on.

146
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Okay, I'll try and say more names.

147
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I'm so sorry.

148
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I'm very flustered when it comes to these kinds of streams.

149
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I feel a little pressured, like...

150
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
How are you so good with your feet?

151
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I don't know, how are you not so good with your feet?

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm trying not to knock over the webcam.

153
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
We'll do this.

154
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
We'll try and say some names, okay?

155
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Although next, plastic goes,

156
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,720
ceruto, cookie, fungler, kids and gamer.

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I've reluctantly said sakura and koku,

158
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:45,720
dimsidown, national panda,

159
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,720
dragon karma, toasty reef oracle, rikos,

160
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,720
voltage isaya, domino miku.

161
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Okay, that was what was done offline.

162
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Now what was done right now is freaking impossible to keep up with,

163
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
but I'm going to try my best, doesn't mean I can't try.

164
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Okay, I'm going to try and keep up.

165
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Please bear with me.

166
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
AC's in the room, bear with me.

167
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Okay.

168
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Could you wet...

169
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Huh?

170
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Could you...

171
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Man, I wish I had a little feet.

172
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Could you wet feet drying my...

173
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Well, I bought pop rocks to see if I can actually get them to pop with my feet sweat alone,

174
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,720
which is pretty gross, but I thought it was really funny.

175
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Right, let me check where the new names come in.

176
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:46,720
I think Zang, PV Mendes, Gaming Kitsune, Zarian, Outplayboy, Zero Bridge,

177
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,720
wait, Firemaker, Pio Giusefina, we have seen...

178
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I recognize some of these names, hold on, I've already said them.

179
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Larry Twenty, Dejan Parma.

180
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Wait, I said these names.

181
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Oh no, I don't know where it starts.

182
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Viral, San Brulee, I said that too.

183
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Draw?

184
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,720
You know what I'm saying?

185
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Everyone get in the name right twice or like, yeah, that's right, forget,

186
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
you better forget my name, yeah.

187
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm repeating sorry, I'm so sorry.

188
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Right, I think we're here.

189
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Ghizalina, I said Jacob Otskou.

190
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Sleepy Fennec, Eye Flora, Super Grung,

191
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
not Alessandro Tenspene,

192
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
I don't know, I recognize I've already said these names.

193
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Oh my god, George, it's so hard for me.

194
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Are you getting ASMR at least?

195
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Congrats on monetization, thank you so much, I'm so sorry,

196
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,720
I'm like really out of my element with these kind of streams.

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm not used to it.

198
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
I don't know, I'm just used to it.

199
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Hopefully I can at least do some actual ASMR in a moment.

200
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm so sorry, I'm trying to catch up for a little.

201
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Tachio, Carbonai, I had nothing.

202
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Scarecrow, damn, okay, I don't recognize saying these.

203
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Blackwing, 757, why did that just change?

204
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Brayoko, I'm a heron.

205
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm a heron, size...

206
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Oh sorry, maybe your other ear should get something else.

207
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Nak Naktoof, 17, Jackie A.

208
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Busbun, Yummy, Ellie Ball, Jackie's,

209
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Garaki, and Gentlemere,

210
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,720
and Scrumptious Nightmare, we did it, we did it.

211
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
I freaking caught up, I don't know how we did it.

212
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Thank you so much for everyone who is becoming a member

213
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
and being so fantastic.

214
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I'm completely out of my element, I do apologize,

215
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
but yeah, you like that?

216
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,720
But thank you so much for your support, you did it!

217
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Can you please scare him like that?

218
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
I was gonna do a fake cam on Buckshot, really.

219
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,720
I don't know if I have to go to a doctor about my toe

220
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
because something is wrong with it,

221
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
and I don't know what on Earth is going on.

222
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Oh she did, so on this toe, this bit here,

223
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,720
she cut into like really deep,

224
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,720
and I was like, oh no, it's fine, like accidents happen.

225
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,720
It was a little bit painful, but I didn't think anything of it.

226
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,720
And then it's actually pretty sore today,

227
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
so I don't know if I have to get a check though.

228
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
But yeah.

229
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
The only good thing with your toe is it's not,

230
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
the only thing wrong with your toe is it's not my max!

231
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Oh my goodness, okay, you're done.

232
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Scrumptious Nightmare, thank you.

233
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Frosty Dino, thank you.

234
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Grampo, thank you for becoming a man, sir.

235
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Yeah, it's good, I do.

236
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
You're not supposed to cut it at all,

237
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,720
a lot of shops do it anyway, yeah.

238
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,720
I think I may have got hurt a little bit, but it's okay.

239
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Turi, thank you.

240
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
I appreciate it.

241
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Right, well let's see if we can open up Pop Rocks

242
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
with their feet and get my feet swept

243
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
to activate the Pop Rocks.

244
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
This might be very loud actually, hold on.

245
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,720
I'm going to take it a little bit away from you, okay?

246
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I don't know if I can do it with my feet till it's open.

247
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Anything is possible if you get your hands on it.

248
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
So we have the...

249
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Grupper Repair Funds for 10, thank you so much.

250
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Oh wait, wasn't there a red?

251
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Why is it not displaying?

252
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,720
I could have sworn us all red earlier.

253
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
It was a red.

254
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
The Jingle of 100 in Celebration and Monetization

255
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
are giving my first ever red symbol.

256
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Thank you, my goodness.

257
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Thank you so much.

258
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Do you guys think you better support the girls

259
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
more than this, I can't say.

260
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Oh my God, I don't think I can rip it open.

261
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Hold on.

262
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Actually having to use my green power.

263
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Monkey Feet Goop.

264
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,720
I can't see if there's like a green rip section on it.

265
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
I can't see anything at all.

266
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
That's why I've not turned my glasses.

267
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Okay, I'm trying to rip it open, but it's gonna work.

268
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Support the girls and the mama.

269
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
You got my neurons.

270
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Congrats on the Monetization.

271
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Thank you.

272
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
It really wasn't that hard in the nicest...

273
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Streams, Assets, Creed, Brotherhood and Nerds

274
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
are about it.

275
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Oh yeah, no thank you.

276
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
I've worked really hard for that.

277
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Diddy, thank you for becoming a member.

278
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Oh my God.

279
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Hi Rain.

280
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
I am so sorry Rain, please don't look.

281
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
It's not what it looks like Rain.

282
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
It's a mistake, okay?

283
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Hi Rain.

284
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
It really didn't mean anything.

285
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Thank you for the 10.

286
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Did you want to put down a pillow first or last?

287
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Nah, it's fine.

288
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,720
The place I am renting the caskets

289
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,720
weren't even cleaned before I moved in,

290
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
so you get what you want back.

291
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Thanks.

292
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Thank you.

293
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I'll let...

294
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
999, thank you for becoming a member.

295
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Okay, I don't think I'm gonna have to choose my hand.

296
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Sorry lads, hold on.

297
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Oh wait, I'll do it off camera.

298
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Watch this.

299
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Oh look at my toes go.

300
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Oh sorry.

301
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Oh sorry, my toes weren't in frame.

302
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Oh dear.

303
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
Oh my toes weren't in frame.

304
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Oh you couldn't see that.

305
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Oh dear.

306
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
But I did get them open.

307
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,720
So, the way my feet sweat the most is in this section

308
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
in between the toes,

309
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,720
so this is what I'm basically gonna aim for.

310
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
This is disgusting.

311
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,720
If this actually pops, this is awful.

312
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,720
If this genuinely pops because of my feet sweating,

313
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
this is terrible.

314
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Okay, if the Spidey, thank you for becoming a member,

315
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
if this pops, I'm actually gonna cry.

316
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I hope so it doesn't, but I'm at the same time anyway.

317
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Hold on.

318
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
I need to sit on the floor for this.

319
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Ooh, I need to do this with my foot.

320
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
As if this pops.

321
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
I can't hold them in my toes.

322
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Did it pop?

323
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
No, I thought I could do it.

324
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I think we're safe.

325
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
I think we're safe.

326
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,720
I can't do it.

327
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Wait, did it pop?

328
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
No.

329
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Oh, hold on.

330
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I hear it, shut up.

331
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Did it pop?

332
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
It's popping.

333
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,720
No, that's so gross.

334
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
I'm gonna sweat my feet this way.

335
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Hold on.

336
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
It popped.

337
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,720
So now you're on the line about that.

338
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
That's disgusting.

339
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
But yeah, I got really sweaty feet.

340
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I also have sweaty hands, maybe I would do it with my hand.

341
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
It's kind of the same thing where it's sweaty

342
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
in between my fingers more.

343
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Salted feet.

344
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Why, you wanna lick them?

345
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Oh, wait.

346
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Oh no, it's getting sticky,

347
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
because my feet are over.

348
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
I never thought this far ahead.

349
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Why am I so low IQ?

350
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
It's such a curse sometimes.

351
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Hold on.

352
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Thank you Esteban Lomiel,

353
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
who I'm gonna remember.

354
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Thank you Colin.

355
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Four, three, one, six.

356
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,720
And thank you Shalom Plain.

357
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
She kinda dumb though.

358
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Sticky feet mean sticky floors.

359
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Oof.

360
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
You put socks on after this stream.

361
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Oh, there's like bits and spots everywhere now.

362
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
You know what?

363
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Maybe that reefling was right,

364
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
and I should have put a towel down.

365
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Hold on, my sweaty hands are so sticky.

366
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,720
They're sticking to my hands.

367
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Look, it's actually a benefit.

368
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
It's actually a benefit, okay?

369
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,720
You just have to think of the situation.

370
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Hold on.

371
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Let me just pop them up there.

372
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Our experiment has been conducted.

373
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Gross, I don't know.

374
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
My ears have a pop rock sometimes.

375
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I'm trying to help.

376
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Actual squid behaviors.

377
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
Honestly.

378
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,720
This is welcome to the reefling membership tier,

379
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
and this is message redacted.

380
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
I don't know how, but here you go.

381
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Thank you Brayoko

382
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
for the super chat.

383
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Oh my god, the super chat, because I'm monetized.

384
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Found your credit card.

385
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Congrats!

386
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Maybe don't...

387
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
You don't have to support, by the way.

388
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
I always have free membership streams all the time.

389
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
Today we learned to always put damage up.

390
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Right, and we're going to actually do ASMR

391
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
at the same time to hold up.

392
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
This is your boy.

393
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
This is ridiculous.

394
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
My offer counts.

395
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Bull, I also got my Skyrim achievements to work.

396
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
I have like 12% Skyrim achievements.

397
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
I don't know why they weren't displayed,

398
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
but we might be able to actually go back

399
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
to the Skyrim stream at any time.

400
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Bull, I thank you for becoming the streamers.

401
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Totally bonkers.

402
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Congrats, new membership. Thank you.

403
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
Thank you, boy, for being a member.

404
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Thank you, uh, Sithmans for coming to member as well.

405
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Yeah.

406
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Oh, you're getting tangled up in Wazir right now.

407
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Shhh.

408
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Next week, yeah.

409
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Our Endurance stream of the week is...

410
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Hold on, let me put these on, yeah.

411
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Thank you, uh, Shiori

412
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
for becoming a member.

413
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
And thank you, Dr. P, for becoming a member.

414
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Hold on, this is going to take some manipulation

415
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,720
because this ear isn't sitting

416
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
the way ears actually sit.

417
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Oh, wow, my feet are so talented.

418
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
You look on Skyrim achievements

419
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,720
and usually take, like, three streams

420
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
unless your stream's super long.

421
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Yeah.

422
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
I'm a bit of an Endurance streamer, okay?

423
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Shhh.

424
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
ASMR.

425
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Thank you, Jay, for the membership.

426
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Thank you.

427
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Oh, woo-ee, for the membership.

428
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Oh, no, they're coming off.

429
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Shhh.

430
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
Say, just say.

431
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Shhh.

432
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Well, those feet grew arms and hands out of nowhere.

433
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
How about your next skill?

434
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Look, I'm going to say for the pod.

435
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I have eight arms, okay?

436
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
How do you buy membership?

437
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Oh, you don't have to.

438
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
There should be a join button,

439
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
but it doesn't work everywhere,

440
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
so don't worry if you can't buy.

441
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
I always have free streams coming out

442
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,720
and the membership streams start next week.

443
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Not this week,

444
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
because by the end of this week

445
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,720
I'll have everything in place

446
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
work-wise so I only have to do shorts.

447
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
And I'm very glad.

448
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I am so glad that all the responsibility

449
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
is taken off me.

450
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,720
And I'm just a normal stromer.

451
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
We should have changed all our names

452
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,720
into Jamal for the stream,

453
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
knowing beforehand you would have said

454
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
every person.

455
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
We should have one reflame.

456
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
It's all arms anyway.

457
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
The logic checks out

458
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
and definitely isn't influenced by the membership.

459
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
And the join button is sometimes

460
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
not next to subscription on mobile.

461
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Yeah, I guess if you're in the phone.

462
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
But don't worry,

463
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
you don't have to directly support me.

464
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I'll always have free streams coming out

465
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
like all the time.

466
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm not kidding.

467
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,720
You can't take me off.

468
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Come on.

469
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
You can't.

470
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
It's not possible.

471
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Okay?

472
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
So don't try and take me off.

473
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Bless the shimi.

474
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Thank you very much.

475
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Remember?

476
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Are you doing me with my dog?

477
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Are you doing hypnosis soon?

478
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Not right now.

479
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
No.

480
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
No of these.

481
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
I don't think anyone can get hypnotized

482
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
by fricking toes.

483
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
You can see how opaque my skin is.

484
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
You can see my blue veins.

485
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Check them veins out.

486
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
You can literally see them.

487
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
I have my little tendons.

488
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
If you look hard enough for them.

489
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Oh, there they are.

490
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Look at them tendons.

491
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Thank you for the tip.

492
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
I'll hold on a string on the swing.

493
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Did Brian talk?

494
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Did Brian say anything?

495
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
I hope not.

496
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Oh, it's kind of working.

497
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Okay.

498
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Stream element says no.

499
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Kind of working.

500
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Mika's big fan.

501
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.

502
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
And then Boyce the Trigger

503
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,720
wore just purple burglar alarm honestly.

504
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Brian said it but he was quiet.

505
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Good.

506
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
I'm glad he didn't say it.

507
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I did not say no.

508
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Bejinga.

509
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,720
In celebration, I gave my first ever ritz.

510
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Yes, I did.

511
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
I'm so sorry.

512
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,720
I'm very scared of brain right now.

513
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Secret, thank you for becoming a member.

514
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
This is the craziest ASMR concept.

515
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
It's not even ASMR, let's be honest.

516
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I'm just dumb.

517
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
I'm just dumb for you.

518
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I'm from a field.

519
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Thank you.

520
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Thank you.

521
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
What?

522
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
At their name?

523
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
At their...

524
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Strony, I just want to stream what I want and enjoy.

525
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Corporals, you can't do that.

526
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
You'll never be successful.

527
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Strony, who my beer makes whole companies

528
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
have life-mangered people to stream with.

529
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,720
I cannot tell you how unbelievably nice it is.

530
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Thank you for that type of thing.

531
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,720
I cannot tell you how unbelievably nice it is

532
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
to have like-minded individuals,

533
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
knowing gays are rats.

534
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,720
I jumped on my alternative Twitter

535
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
and was listening to the feed.

536
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I'm just sitting listening to A.C. Tinkle

537
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,720
and I'm just like, yeah, this is actually quite good quality.

538
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Honestly, I wouldn't mind if she brought a 3D one there.

539
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,720
It is so nice to have like-minded individuals

540
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,720
that are like, yeah, let's provide the goods.

541
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
We say no to blue-balling here, okay?

542
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
You ask and you receive, okay?

543
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
You ask other agencies, you get donor-walled.

544
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Hold on, I'm going to take a drink of water.

545
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm going to put dehydrate.

546
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Please take a drink of it now.

547
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:52,720
P.L.U.R. allegations are yet to be resolved.

548
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,720
I will make a public statement about the P.L.U.R. allegations.

549
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,720
As you can see, we're in very hot water about the P.L.U.R. allegations.

550
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,720
What is donor-walled?

551
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Donor-walled is when someone gives a streamer a lot of money

552
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,720
via a donation and the streamer doesn't read it out loud

553
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
for whatever reason it may be.

554
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
They genuinely missed it.

555
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
That's very plausible.

556
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
They don't want to acknowledge it

557
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
because of maybe the contents,

558
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
but donor-walled is the term

559
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,720
when someone gives over money and still gets the money.

560
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
That's beyond.

561
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Thank you for becoming a member.

562
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Good luck with the P.L.U.R. campaign.

563
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Mi-Win-Jin 2 comes out of the P.L.U.R. campaign.

564
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,720
P.L.U.R. is the best station in the world.

565
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Okay, I genuinely think I managed to catch up to everyone.

566
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Thank you so much for all of the love and support.

567
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm really overwhelmed right now

568
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
and I feel so out of my element.

569
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,720
I'm like, oh my god, what do I do?

570
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,720
I figured out what I do to P.L.U.R.

571
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Right, so you may notice that my tier 2 is $4.99.

572
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,720
I don't think it can be gifted unless on purpose, right?

573
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Like, can you not just manually put in gift $1.99?

574
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Internet-baz of fees.

575
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Thank you for the member.

576
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Hold on, I'm trying so hard to do this.

577
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,720
The P.L.U.R. needs to rehire a P.L.U.R. position.

578
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
A P.L.U.R. position.

579
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Oh, jeez.

580
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
This is embarrassing, I can't grip it.

581
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Oh, there we go.

582
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Surprise, surprise.

583
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
If you use two feet, you can grip it really well.

584
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Jeremy, thank you for coming to member.

585
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,720
I'm so sorry to end when I'm alienating right now in this room.

586
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Literally, this is getting...

587
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Come on, please.

588
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Okay, here we go.

589
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
We'll do it like this.

590
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Wow, Asterix.

591
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Thank you for the five gifted members.

592
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Did it do a moose?

593
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
You guys have a moose now.

594
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Jake, Jake said pre-looked grippers.

595
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Let's go, honestly.

596
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Okay, just that.

597
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
I'm gonna put it like that.

598
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Oh, there we go.

599
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
We got it.

600
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Oh my god, we got it.

601
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
The Dexterix.

602
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Just admit it.

603
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Just admit it.

604
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,720
No other streamer is even capable of doing this physically,

605
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
because they wouldn't be able to do it.

606
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
This is absolutely staggering.

607
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Did anyone take a...

608
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Or is everyone just blown away by this

609
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
even being a streamer concept?

610
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Do you know how long I planned this for?

611
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
I planned this for...

612
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I planned this

613
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
back when I was concepted

614
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
to have French tits and nails,

615
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
which is absolutely awful.

616
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
I've been waiting months on this idea

617
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
to utilize it.

618
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Man is up one.

619
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Thank you for...

620
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Right, can I do two at once?

621
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
I think I can.

622
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Hold them by the bottom.

623
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Oh, this is...

624
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Hold on.

625
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
We're losing them.

626
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
My feet are so sweaty that they're...

627
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Right, they're up,

628
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
and then...

629
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Oh, they're up a bit too much.

630
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
I can do this chat.

631
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Let me do it.

632
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Does that even work?

633
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Oh, my ankle just cracked.

634
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Did you hear that?

635
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Literally jewel-wielding the tingles right now.

636
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,720
We're in uncharted territory.

637
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,720
I'll forget to say, why can I not do it with that one?

638
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,720
I wonder if the plaster is actually helping me grip this one.

639
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
I'm jewel-wielding tingles.

640
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Why?

641
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
I think my feet are actually getting too sweaty

642
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
to pick this up because it's glass.

643
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
I think I'm gonna have to take off.

644
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Right.

645
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
I think I'm literally...

646
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Hold on, we'll just go the brush.

647
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Calm, calm.

648
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
The migraine, thank you for becoming a member.

649
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
I appreciate it.

650
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,720
If this isn't peak streaming, I don't know what is.

651
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Honestly, like, which year...

652
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Which year's...

653
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Where the heck is my other...

654
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Oh, here.

655
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Hold on, I'm cheating.

656
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Just a little bit.

657
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Jewel-wield brushes.

658
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
Come on.

659
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Come on, admit it.

660
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
It's just so hard to do because of the ankle.

661
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Oh, there we go.

662
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,720
I just need to relax the gripper.

663
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
ASMR.

664
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
I'm impressed.

665
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Did you watch the new Echo Showcase?

666
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Apparently Fable 4 is coming out.

667
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Wait, hold on a second.

668
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
I'm gonna just grip it sideways.

669
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Ta-da.

670
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
We love joe feet wielding tingles.

671
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
I bet you do.

672
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Wah, thank you for becoming a member.

673
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Yay, Fable.

674
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
But they were saying...

675
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
And apparently the new Dragon Age Origins

676
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,720
has, like, a ton of little G-fans really mad

677
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
because there's something wrong with that.

678
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Like, how do you fix them then?

679
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Oh, and my feet are actually too...

680
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Getting too sweaty.

681
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Correct the shit.

682
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Hold on.

683
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
I need my pinkie.

684
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
I need my pinkie to join in on the grip.

685
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I need my gripper.

686
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,720
She's put maxing on food?

687
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
I am.

688
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,720
From a two-handed build in Skyrim to a joe wield build

689
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
the next day, so talented.

690
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
I know.

691
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
I know.

692
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Isn't it amazing?

693
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,720
God, look at the gel shine on that big toe.

694
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
Oh, look at that shine.

695
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Oh, that's gorgeous.

696
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
I admire my own feet.

697
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Yes, I do.

698
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
And such cool.

699
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Rosso, thank you for becoming a member.

700
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Omen.

701
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,720
So then thank you for becoming a member.

702
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Oh, my ring light there.

703
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,720
That's what's lighting up the deck under here

704
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
because it's all dark.

705
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,720
So that's what the gel polish is doing.

706
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Delicious brown waifu.

707
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,720
Thank you for becoming a member.

708
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Not 3DO, it should have been me.

709
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Hammerfell is going to come in 2026 if we're lucky.

710
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
I'll be so interested to see if I'll enjoy the game or not.

711
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,720
It might be one of those games where I have to play offline for the first time

712
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
to even appreciate it.

713
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,720
I don't know if you ever, like, you know, your first play through of a game,

714
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
you're so silent and so quiet

715
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,720
because you're just experiencing it for the first time.

716
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
So I feel like it would be hard to commentate.

717
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
Like, I really want to play Big Bobby's Gate,

718
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
but I'm worried I won't have a thought,

719
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,720
like a single thought formed because I've never played it before.

720
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,720
I'm sad I can't hear, but the visuals, the visuals, though.

721
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Yeah, you like the visuals.

722
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Can I do the middle finger on a toe?

723
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Hold on.

724
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Can I?

725
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
No, I'll just put this down.

726
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,720
And then bring you back up again.

727
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
And then everyone go down.

728
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
Oh, no, it's not going to work.

729
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
I don't have that kind of...

730
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
I don't have that kind of toe deck, though.

731
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
You have the kind where I can, like, grip around and stuff.

732
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
My appendages.

733
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
My appendages.

734
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
I'm actually tempted to leave these on

735
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,720
because it's helping to muffle me making any mistakes.

736
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Crying.

737
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Shimmer pants.

738
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
Thank you for the time.

739
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Congrats on monetization, Stony.

740
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Thank you!

741
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Like, we had a direct support.

742
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,720
A fan made more remaster of oblivion made in Scourge Engine

743
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
is coming out to it with us.

744
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Cue.

745
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
I do a little tapping these more.

746
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,720
It feels like I don't have the dexterity to do the frog thing.

747
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,720
If Wolves and Gromit aren't becoming cranes of beyond on our fellow...

748
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Oh, does a Wolves and Gromit thing come out?

749
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
How far can your tanky pool?

750
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
What do you mean, far?

751
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
I can only go like this.

752
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Sky Blivion.

753
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Get Nordid.

754
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Get Nordid.

755
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Get Nordid.

756
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Hmm.

757
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,720
It's commonly referred to as Sky Blivion by the project workers.

758
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
Aren't they not...

759
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Wouldn't they not get a season to say that they're doing that?

760
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
What's going on?

761
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Cup your ears.

762
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
I'm cupping your ears.

763
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,720
There's also a mod project that makes all of Nen...

764
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
Nen?

765
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,720
I would love if the Morrowind remake would come out, but we will hope.

766
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Cheese, Gromit.

767
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
I'm sure there's a new Wolves and Gromit thing coming out.

768
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
I don't know if it's a movie or what.

769
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Because everyone was like, oh, a new Wolves and Gromit before GTA 6.

770
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
No, because it's fantastic.

771
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Fanmade mods are free.

772
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Ah, that's how they got away with it.

773
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,720
But this, it doesn't actually get up a day about mods and assets they pack.

774
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Fallout 3 and New Vegas are fine.

775
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,720
What were the accusations that Fallout 4 got the most useless update recently?

776
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,720
And it was to spite modders to break them all or something?

777
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,720
Was that Fallout 4 or did I make that up?

778
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,720
The amount of complete reworks on this current engine is crazy.

779
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Danny Elorma make volume, by the way.

780
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
It keeps peaking red.

781
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
But...

782
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Yeah, they had more than they would hope their studio got burned or other stuff and more.

783
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,720
I'm playing Fallout 4 right now.

784
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,720
The update Fallout 4 due to the show, and it broke all the mods and the mods.

785
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Oh, okay, that makes more sense.

786
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
That makes it feel good.

787
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Okay, it keeps peaking red and I'm like, am I, am I, am I grippers to OP for this microphone right now?

788
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Wow.

789
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Hmm.

790
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Peter, Salis, whose voice grew on it passed away.

791
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Oh.

792
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
I guess I don't have to get a fan, do I?

793
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
That sounds good.

794
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
I'm glad.

795
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
I thought right, my ears are fine, my ears are fine.

796
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Good.

797
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Just so you know, for the replays, this isn't an endurance stream.

798
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,720
I'm very out of my element with the webcam on and I'm like...

799
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Okay, now what?

800
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I'm like, okay.

801
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,720
But thank you so, so much to everyone who's membering.

802
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Thank you so, so much to everyone who's super-chan or tiffin or anything.

803
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
It's such a fantastic help.

804
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Like, obviously I don't want to say too much, but, you know, it takes a year to create a new generation, so this is very reassuring.

805
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,720
If there may or may not be some plans in the background, ho, ho, ho.

806
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
We love mommy, love you, Eastling.

807
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Thank you, seriously.

808
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Like, I'm a bit overwhelmed.

809
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Like, I literally have my hands like this because I'm like, oh, okay.

810
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
I was nervous.

811
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
Like, I don't know what to do.

812
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
I was nervous to sleep.

813
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Genius idea, please.

814
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:19,720
I was going to do a photo-cam stream on Buckshot Relay and then you guys can tell me to put my feet back on the floor because I always sit on them.

815
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Absolutely.

816
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
There were the scores last, literally.

817
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Thank you.

818
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Yes, I just filled out my element.

819
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
I'm like, I'm used to meme-ing.

820
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,720
I'm used to, well, I guess the stream is a big meme, to be honest.

821
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,720
I don't need to put that much, like, what's the word, that much.

822
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:52,720
I did bring, I know everyone is tired of Japanese youth cleaning tools, and it gets done today, but it's true.

823
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Thank you, Tiko Suwabi, for becoming a member.

824
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
I can't pick this up, hold on.

825
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Thank you, Berenice Yuzette, for becoming a member.

826
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,720
And thank you, Eleka Riaz.

827
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Wow, sorry I'm late.

828
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
No need to be sorry at all.

829
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Thank you for becoming a member.

830
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
Forgiveness sake.

831
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,720
When it's really thin, it's so hard to grip.

832
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Seriously.

833
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
This is, like, outrageously thin, right?

834
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,720
I'm not going to need to, like, bring it closer.

835
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,720
And then, I need to take this off gently, if I can even do that.

836
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,720
That's right, you're cleaning via foot, or whatever.

837
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,720
Ah, Internet, Bazoo, File, Mealtalk, it's cool to see you willing to be able to,

838
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,720
it's a challenge, even with a handful of people, much less.

839
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,720
300, eh, 300, that's like 600, throwing money, literally.

840
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,720
I'm definitely not a handcam streamer, I don't think I, I don't, don't expect any footcam, handcam.

841
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,720
After this, I'm going to be honest, I'm like, oh, it's not for me.

842
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,720
Right, we're going to do this as gently as possible, okay?

843
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
Gentle.

844
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Thank you for coming to my ear cleaning foot spa experience.

845
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,720
I ran through, thank you for becoming a member.

846
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Now just let the brush slowly glide across your ear.

847
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,720
And as the brush cleans the outer ear, hold on.

848
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,720
You will find yourself, hold on, and relax.

849
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Just like this.

850
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Instructional ASMR, just let me ASMR you.

851
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Oh yeah, that's right, that's the money shot.

852
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,720
That's so hard to, to, I'm tripping, my poor pinky.

853
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Look how hard my pinky is trying right now.

854
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,720
My pinky is like going to France without hard as trying.

855
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
You can't be feetlings anymore.

856
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
After the stream, I don't think you're feetlings.

857
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,720
I think I'll stick to the VTuber model because I'm like so nervous with the webcam on.

858
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Plastic girl, thank you for the 10.

859
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,720
If you like feet though, Emmy's doing foot cam stream later this week, okay?

860
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Emmy Bezu, her link is in the description.

861
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Subscribe and hit the bell if you are into feet because she's, oh, I just dropped it.

862
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
I don't even notice I dropped it, hold on.

863
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,720
Right, and then pass it to this one.

864
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,720
This is my strong foot, take my strong foot.

865
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Refling, take my strong foot.

866
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,720
Refling, no, don't fall, grab onto my foot.

867
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
Grab onto my French pedicure foot.

868
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
French pedicure pedicure.

869
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,720
Thank you.

870
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Ruin desolations, as I remember.

871
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
Thank you, jargon hearts, for becoming a member.

872
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,720
This is literally my left foot.

873
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,720
Unless, unless I hold it like a pencil.

874
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,720
Hold on, I need to like dab it against myself.

875
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Just know whenever you hear ear cleaning in my ASMR role plays, it's not done by my hands.

876
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,720
It's done by my foot.

877
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Foot holding him.

878
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Thank you everyone for memberships and supporting me.

879
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
I appreciate it.

880
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:41,720
We are testing if tier two needs to be higher than 4.99 US dollars.

881
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,720
But I don't think it has to be.

882
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
Not from what I've seen.

883
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,720
Oh no, it's dropped again, jeez.

884
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
This is really difficult.

885
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720
I thought I had a bit more.

886
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
I think because it's so thin.

887
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,720
Okay, there we go.

888
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
This is easy.

889
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
It's gone again, jeez.

890
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
I'm going to have to joe wield this.

891
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Double the twos, honestly.

892
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,720
B, yaku.

893
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
G, yaku.

894
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,720
Thank you for the membership.

895
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
I appreciate it.

896
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,720
Right, we're swapping.

897
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
We're swapping.

898
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
I can't do this anymore.

899
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,720
Okay, let's do the bubbles.

900
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,720
I said let's do the bubbles.

901
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
This is the most bizarre monetization celebration I've ever seen.

902
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
I've actually outdone myself.

903
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,720
I've actually surprised myself.

904
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,720
Weird, this concept.

905
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Can the bubbles come?

906
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
Sorry, that was probably really loud.

907
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,720
I'm so sorry.

908
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:55,720
I hope no one's actually consuming this stream at a level of loud ASMR.

909
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,720
No, don't listen to the stream at ASMR levels.

910
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Don't be silly.

911
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,720
My skull, we're faked.

912
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,720
Okay, I was going to say don't be silly and listen at ASMR levels.

913
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,720
My feet are literally the pilot.

914
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,720
You're telling me you trust my feet not to ever make a blip.

915
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,720
I know my ear drum's still there.

916
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,720
Ow, my ear.

917
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
Yeah, no.

918
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
Don't listen at ASMR levels.

919
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Don't be silly and listen.

920
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
It's absolutely no way.

921
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Right, so for some reason stream elements can see when you guys gift other people,

922
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,720
but it won't register a membership if you bought it yourself.

923
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,720
I don't know why.

924
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,720
You're kicking into my CPUs ASMR?

925
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
That's terrible.

926
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Fiat, thank you for becoming a member.

927
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Is your name Fiat for a particular reason in the stream?

928
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
That's strange.

929
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
Yeah, I don't know why.

930
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,720
I'm not going to lie to you, your voice overpowers any sound.

931
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,720
I could have heard so far would need a different session.

932
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,720
Hi, Stony, congrats on unlock and monetization.

933
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
Thank you.

934
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,720
I was thinking you can find yourself.

935
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
Oh, thank you.

936
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Member just for anyone listening.

937
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,720
You don't actually have to member, by the way.

938
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,720
I always have free content coming up, so please don't worry.

939
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,720
Please make sure you look after yourself first such as you pay off your debts

940
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,720
because we live in a society and if you're debt free, it's good for you,

941
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
but bad for society.

942
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
But we can get into that in another stream.

943
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,720
John07, thank you for the membership.

944
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
I appreciate it.

945
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,720
Sorry about all the camera glitching, by the way.

946
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,720
This is a very dusty webcam.

947
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
A very dusty.

948
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,720
Nero, thank you for becoming a member.

949
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,720
Nero2276, I was supposed to say your phone number.

950
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,720
The camera's fine.

951
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
Peppermint.

952
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,720
Did I say that right?

953
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
Peppermint.

954
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
There's no R.

955
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,720
Okay, ah, you never mind.

956
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,720
Okay, never mind.

957
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
Oh, we got there in the end.

958
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,720
Don't worry, Stony, even if we get our ears bumped, you're still the best put stream.

959
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
Ah, is that my new title now?

960
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,720
Like the best put streamer?

961
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,720
I would honestly take that title.

962
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,720
I'm quite happy with that title.

963
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
It's all right.

964
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,720
My feet are here to comfort you.

965
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:47,720
When it has been a long day, my sweaty grippers are here to pretend to tangle you

966
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,720
because let's be honest, this isn't an ASMR stream.

967
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,720
No one believes at all this is an ASMR stream.

968
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,720
Just because you have the 3D view, it doesn't make it an ASMR stream.

969
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:06,720
Which is why the title's called Monetization Celebration Stream and not ASMR.

970
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,720
Watch Mercy's stream.

971
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,720
I was wondering if you could do a Q&A too.

972
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,720
I would absolutely love to.

973
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,720
I would love to do a Q&A.

974
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,720
Maybe we can read membership.

975
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,720
Membership.

976
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,720
Marshmallow.

977
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
We can read marshmallow.

978
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,720
Absolutely.

979
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,720
Air Rocks.

980
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Starley.

981
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,720
Air Rocks.

982
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,720
Starley.

983
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,720
Yes.

984
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,720
We can 100% do a marshmallow reading.

985
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,720
That would be fantastic.

986
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,720
Although Mercy was purposely saying stuff wrong, which was quite funny.

987
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,720
Really giving bad advice.

988
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Logan, have a lit.

989
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
Thank you so much.

990
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,720
If you hear my stomach, it's not because I'm hungry and starving.

991
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:52,720
It's because I got a massive loaf of bread and I wouldn't come out before the stream.

992
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,720
I went to the toilet three times and I never came out.

993
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,720
So I'm sorry if you hear my stomach.

994
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,720
This could be really funny for an April Fool's stream.

995
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,720
Well, you win the grippers out again.

996
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,720
What would the title of the stream be?

997
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,720
Too many people ask real questions, but most of Mercy's advice was real, was it?

998
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,720
Wait, hold on.

999
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,720
Let me get my marshmallow.

1000
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
Because I was a movement.

1001
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,720
And then I'll go up along.

1002
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,720
I should only cut ones, yeah?

1003
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,720
What?

1004
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,720
You asked me anything.

1005
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,720
And before I can hardly say anything, that was,

1006
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,720
wait, where can I pin this?

1007
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,720
I would like to pin it, but the love heart is in the way.

1008
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,720
Someone at YouTube, you're telling me not one person at YouTube is aware of this issue?

1009
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,720
I refuse.

1010
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
Ten message.

1011
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
April Fool's.

1012
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
How is it April Fool's if I've already done it?

1013
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,720
I've already got you.

1014
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,720
The gag has been done.

1015
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,720
You can do my breath on me.

1016
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,720
Okay.

1017
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,720
That's my marshmallow thing.

1018
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,720
And what?

1019
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,720
No, Tier 2 is what's getting gifted, mummy.

1020
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,720
You have to raise a price for both ears.

1021
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,720
Wait, no.

1022
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,720
I only want emotes to be gifted.

1023
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,720
I wanted to leave emotes as $1.99.

1024
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,720
And I have to make it $5 for Tier 2?

1025
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:40,720
Honestly, the mental stress of raising it by $0.02 is really good to me.

1026
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,720
Okay.

1027
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,720
Be bad in gagging.

1028
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,720
Thank you for the membership.

1029
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,720
I appreciate it.

1030
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,720
We did warn you.

1031
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,720
I was just wanting them to work so badly.

1032
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
I don't want to raise the price.

1033
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,720
I have to, apparently if I want to raise the price,

1034
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,720
I need to close the tier and then open up a new one.

1035
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,720
I don't even know what happens.

1036
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,720
It only lets you donate the $4.99 tier.

1037
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,720
I'm so happy to have you back.

1038
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,720
I miss you.

1039
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,720
I miss you too.

1040
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
Oh, that's so annoying.

1041
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,720
I have to raise the price by a freaking dollar.

1042
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,720
So, by a dollar, by a cent.

1043
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,720
So, if I make it, you would leave emotes at $1.99.

1044
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,720
But Tier 2 has to go up to $5.99.

1045
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,720
Does it actually have to be?

1046
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Say it right, sir.

1047
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
I will not go.

1048
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
Turn the lights off.

1049
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
Carry me home.

1050
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
Yeah.

1051
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,720
It has to go up to $5.99.

1052
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,720
It's just a dollar, do it.

1053
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,720
But you don't understand.

1054
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,720
You don't understand the principle

1055
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,720
about how much I can gloat and brag

1056
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,720
that it's only $9.99 to support your Oshi

1057
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,720
for a month, I feel, or you don't understand.

1058
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,720
Okay.

1059
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,720
But it's kind of more of the YouTube channel

1060
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,720
having to make problems, it's fine.

1061
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,720
So, right, I guess after this stream,

1062
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,720
for those of you who sign up now for the Tier 2,

1063
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,720
I think you only have to pay the $1 difference

1064
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,720
to get on the tier that is...

1065
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,720
Oh, that's so annoying.

1066
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,720
Can I make that new tier live, at least?

1067
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
Or is this like...

1068
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,720
I don't know how YouTube's going to take this.

1069
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,720
Oh, I don't know if YouTube's going to like me.

1070
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
Hold on.

1071
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,720
Levels, edit levels.

1072
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,720
No!

1073
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,720
It locked in, the price is locked in.

1074
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,720
I don't want to put up a dollar, but I have to.

1075
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,720
Oh, my God.

1076
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,720
Please, YouTube's not...

1077
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,720
Right, I have to basically add a new tier...

1078
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,720
For goodness' sake.

1079
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,720
Reefling member stream tier.

1080
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,720
Oh, and...

1081
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,720
For goodness' sake.

1082
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,720
You know tier...

1083
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,720
Oh, okay.

1084
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,720
Hold on, we're trying to do it together.

1085
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,720
Right, we need to do it in American Double Laws.

1086
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,720
United States, set a price...

1087
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,720
$5.99.

1088
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,720
$5.99.

1089
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,720
That's a book in it.

1090
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,720
Modes, give that man a backshot.

1091
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,720
What?

1092
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
Wait, what did that happen?

1093
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,720
We're doing it live, we're doing it live.

1094
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,720
We're doing it live, we are.

1095
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
Reefling...

1096
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,720
I'll just put it, Reefling member real tier.

1097
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,720
Because I'm out of things.

1098
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,720
And then add a peric...

1099
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,720
membership stream.

1100
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,720
Membership only live streams.

1101
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,720
This is the real deal.

1102
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,720
Y'all.

1103
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,720
And then peric instructions, nothing,

1104
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,720
because you guys don't need to do anything.

1105
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,720
Then next, what happens?

1106
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,720
I understand that once my offer's reviews improved,

1107
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,720
I'm unable to change, to introduce a new price,

1108
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,720
I can create a new level and or delete any existing.

1109
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:22,720
Deleting a level will cancel existing memberships if it happens.

1110
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,720
Okay, submit for review.

1111
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:31,720
Yes, my tier, my freaking membership streams do not have...

1112
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,720
Sorry, I'm like straight up talking when there's a thing.

1113
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,720
No, it does not come...

1114
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,720
Right, your peric is being sent for review, it said...

1115
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,720
$5.99!

1116
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,720
That's so expensive, I'm going to have to stream way more than...

1117
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,720
I'm going to have to stream more to earn that,

1118
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,720
because $5.99 is really getting expensive.

1119
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Does it even display the damn thing?

1120
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,720
I don't think so.

1121
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,720
Right, it doesn't display it,

1122
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,720
because it's not been approved by YouTube, question mark.

1123
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,720
It's $1.

1124
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,720
So like, all the tier twos will be reset.

1125
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,720
So the tier twos can upgrade via $1.99.

1126
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,720
You already stream more than most, it's no problem.

1127
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,720
We can buy one less candy per month.

1128
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,720
You already stream every day.

1129
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,720
Yeah, well you're ready for multiple streams in one day of different things?

1130
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,720
Yeah.

1131
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,720
Am I losing my membership tier?

1132
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,720
Maybe.

1133
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,720
Why does it not work?

1134
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,720
Why does it not work?

1135
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,720
So what does it say? Is it there?

1136
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,720
No, it's not been approved, so you can't see it.

1137
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,720
Elliebot, thank you for the membership upgrade.

1138
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,720
Why does it specify you upgraded?

1139
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,720
That's so specific.

1140
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,720
Oh no, more streams, oh no.

1141
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
Thank you for fixing that.

1142
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,720
Yes, so we need to wait for YouTube to approve the new tier,

1143
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,720
and then that's the actual tier.

1144
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,720
I guess, but I don't know how long it takes to get it approved.

1145
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,720
I wonder, actually, I wonder if YouTube is going to be able to see

1146
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,720
that it's so similar to the second one,

1147
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,720
and they're going to be like, yeah, you're dumb.

1148
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
You praised it wrong, didn't you?

1149
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,720
And I'm like, yes, I praised it wrong, please forgive me.

1150
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,720
I'm sorry.

1151
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,720
And then YouTube will be like, I will have mercy on your soul.

1152
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,720
Your levels are approved, published.

1153
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,720
Wait, what? I already got approved?

1154
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,720
Wait.

1155
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,720
Hello, YouTube? Are you watching me right now?

1156
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,720
I promise I'm not doing anything bad.

1157
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,720
Feet are a natural part of the body.

1158
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,720
Thank you for monetizing me, YouTube.

1159
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,720
Please don't take it away.

1160
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,720
Is YouTube actually here right now?

1161
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
Why did it just get approved?

1162
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,720
Is it approved? Is it live?

1163
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,720
Wait, hold on, let me try it.

1164
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,720
Oh, okay. Wow, it is.

1165
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,720
Okay, right.

1166
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,720
I'm going to delete the other tier.

1167
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,720
Okay, thank you for upgrading.

1168
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,720
Did I delete it now?

1169
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,720
And then, oh my God, everyone's upgrading.

1170
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,720
Thank you so much.

1171
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,720
I'm so sorry, Mifflins.

1172
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,720
I'm so, so sorry.

1173
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,720
I've completely messed this.

1174
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,720
I've absolutely balled this one up.

1175
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,720
Right, I will delete the...

1176
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,720
How do I delete it?

1177
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,720
I do.

1178
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,720
I will delete it.

1179
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,720
Delete this level.

1180
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,720
If you delete a level, members of that level will lose their membership.

1181
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
Consider notifying them before deleting,

1182
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
encouraging them to change levels.

1183
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,720
Any member that purchases this level this month will be reimbursed.

1184
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,720
Okay, that's good.

1185
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,720
Any member that purchased this level this month will be reimbursed.

1186
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,720
Okay, YouTube, I'm reading that myself.

1187
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,720
Once you submit your changes, they'll get approved.

1188
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,720
Delete.

1189
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,720
Next, submit and review.

1190
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,720
I understand that once my offer is reviewed and approved,

1191
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,720
all members of deleted levels will lose their membership

1192
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,720
and will be reimbursed for the last month.

1193
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,720
Okay, submit for review.

1194
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,720
We're doing it live.

1195
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,720
Okay, we're doing it live.

1196
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,720
Do it live.

1197
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Publish.

1198
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,720
Did that work?

1199
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,720
What does it say now?

1200
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,720
Wait, hold on, let me refresh.

1201
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
Hold on, I think we did it.

1202
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,720
Hold on, pause.

1203
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,720
I think we did it.

1204
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,720
We did it.

1205
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,720
Okay, I will not mess up with the girls,

1206
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,720
but I will...

1207
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,720
Okay, there we go.

1208
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,720
I believe it's fully working now.

1209
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,720
If you do gift memberships, it will only go to refling emotes,

1210
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,720
which I need to add a sugar ton to

1211
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,720
because it was like, you're only allowed to add four emotes

1212
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,720
until you get more members,

1213
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,720
so I'll add to the rest and I'll commission a ton more

1214
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,720
because with that amount of membership,

1215
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,720
I think there's quite more than 10 slots that I have.

1216
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,720
Thank you so much for your patience for me doing this.

1217
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,720
Thank you everyone who's upgrading to the new tier.

1218
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:10,720
I do apologize for the mistake.

1219
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,720
I really severely wanted membership gifting to be on emotes only

1220
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,720
because I didn't want to charge more than $5.99.

1221
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,720
No, $4.99.

1222
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,720
Thank you everyone who's upgrading.

1223
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,720
Can I see your upgrades?

1224
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,720
Nope.

1225
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,720
Stream Ellen's just really doesn't like it.

1226
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,720
That's very curious.

1227
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,720
Very curious indeed.

1228
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,720
But I won't mess up for the girls when I enable it.

1229
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,720
I don't know if and when.

1230
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,720
I don't know if she's doing hers right now.

1231
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,720
If she is, it's a surprise.

1232
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:52,720
I don't know if I'm the only one who's currently doing the membership member.

1233
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,720
Oh my god, I don't think.

1234
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,720
Wait, it's not telling me the upgrades?

1235
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,720
No.

1236
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,720
It's not telling me when you've upgraded.

1237
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
Like on my screen, on any screen.

1238
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,720
I'm so sorry.

1239
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,720
I don't think I can keep up with the upgrades.

1240
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,720
Thank you everyone who's upgrading.

1241
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,720
I appreciate it.

1242
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,720
I'm so sorry.

1243
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,720
I suck.

1244
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,720
I suck as a streamer.

1245
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,720
My apologies for such an unprofessional start.

1246
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,720
But then again, is it really me if it's not unprofessional?

1247
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,720
It's so over.

1248
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,720
No.

1249
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,720
We will support the cut for this regard.

1250
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,720
Thank you.

1251
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,720
I think it's not an upgrade now because the tier is gone.

1252
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,720
So it's just a new membership.

1253
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,720
It's not registered.

1254
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,720
Oh wait, is it registered?

1255
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720
Oh no.

1256
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,720
This can't be.

1257
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,720
Wait, how am I supposed to...

1258
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,720
Oh wow, so it's not even telling me if it's an upgrade now.

1259
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,720
Okay, this is good.

1260
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,720
Membership note showing in your stream elements is a bug with your stream elements account.

1261
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,720
I've contacted their support about it.

1262
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,720
I wonder if the stream elements is for Twitch really.

1263
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,720
But thank you so much everyone for upgrading or becoming a member of the tier.

1264
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,720
I actually can't remember if I've said it wrong.

1265
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,720
We can just send it.

1266
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,720
You're more professional than many streamers.

1267
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,720
You treat us like humans.

1268
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,720
Who streams and doesn't treat you like a human?

1269
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
What?

1270
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,720
Please tell me there's not actually streamers like that.

1271
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,720
I remember when you guys taught me that people get actually jealous.

1272
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,720
Like if they see you in someone else's chat and I'm like, huh?

1273
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,720
That's real?

1274
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,720
Because I thought you guys were memeing on me, like teaching me this.

1275
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:47,720
And I'm like, wait, some VTubers expect you to solely watch them and only them.

1276
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,720
It was very eye-opening.

1277
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,720
Very eye-opening.

1278
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,720
Boy, thank you for the tip.

1279
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,720
Alert this.

1280
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,720
For some reason, I can see that on stream elements, but nothing else.

1281
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,720
I can see if someone gifts membership on stream elements as well.

1282
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,720
But that's it.

1283
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,720
This bit was off.

1284
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,720
Some people are a bit cray-cray about it.

1285
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,720
I used to be sweating right now.

1286
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,720
That was slightly different.

1287
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,720
I understand where she said that.

1288
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,720
Yeah, it's a lot more common than you think.

1289
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,720
I'm only going to have time for you to try.

1290
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,720
It's a lot more than 12 hours streams, yeah.

1291
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,720
Oh, thank you for the gifted membership.

1292
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,720
iPor, thank you.

1293
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,720
Oh, you need to allow gifts.

1294
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,720
There may be a prompt in chat right now to allow gifts.

1295
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,720
Make sure you click it.

1296
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,720
Thank you.

1297
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,720
It will say that you can receive gifts.

1298
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,720
I don't know how it works.

1299
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,720
My membership just got refunded.

1300
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
Did I miss something?

1301
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:58,720
Yes, I had to change the price because gifted membership was the wrong price.

1302
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,720
So thank you, everyone, who's resubbing.

1303
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:06,720
I believe you got a refund question mark question mark, which is really good.

1304
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:16,720
It's so sweet.

1305
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,720
Yeah, we all got refunded.

1306
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,720
That was really quick.

1307
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,720
Honestly, shout out to YouTube if everyone literally got refunded.

1308
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,720
That was so quick.

1309
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,720
Where is the join button on mobile?

1310
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,720
Get right, you're on mobile.

1311
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,720
There is no join button.

1312
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,720
It's just a mystery.

1313
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,720
The join button is more of a suggestion than actual rules.

1314
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,720
Thank you, everyone, for resubbing.

1315
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,720
I'm so sorry.

1316
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,720
T.W., thank you for resubbing.

1317
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:49,720
Giving Kitsuny, Consulus, Lolliwika, Conrad, Asterix.

1318
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,720
I'm like pretty sure I've said all these names before.

1319
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,720
I'm so sorry to anyone whose name I haven't said before.

1320
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,720
The join button is on the YouTube page.

1321
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:06,720
Oh, if you want my YouTube page, apparently.

1322
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,720
Cookie Fumplur.

1323
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:12,720
You guys have such funny gamer tags, honestly.

1324
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,720
Sorry, I meant 21 Bibboots over 21 days.

1325
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,720
Not all at once.

1326
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,720
I was in a rush to get a brain rot.

1327
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,720
I was about to clarify.

1328
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,720
Okay, I was going to say that was quite the length.

1329
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,720
Being inspired by the 21 days of brushing me.

1330
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,720
The microplastics will be purged.

1331
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,720
Oh, that's a good, I like that.

1332
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,720
I subscribed on desktop with PayPal on the old 4.99.

1333
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,720
So what now?

1334
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,720
YouTube should have already refunded you apparently.

1335
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:40,720
Apparently everyone already got refunded like within seconds.

1336
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:47,720
So the new tier is $1 more due to the fact that Gifted Membership will go to Emote Tier,

1337
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,720
which was what I wanted.

1338
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,720
But I was so stubborn and like, oh yeah, YouTube.

1339
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:59,720
I'm sure YouTube will make sure that you can't donate streams at that price.

1340
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,720
But no, no.

1341
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,720
YouTube insisted.

1342
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,720
YouTube insisted.

1343
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,720
PayPal learned me what's pending.

1344
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,720
It should.

1345
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,720
VTuber Foot Connoisseur, thank you.

1346
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,720
What a name.

1347
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,720
What a name to show up in this stream with.

1348
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,720
What a name.

1349
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,720
Thank you for becoming a member.

1350
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,720
That's hilarious.

1351
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,720
Mika's biggest fan.

1352
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,720
I'm thinking Mika, Mika, Uwe.

1353
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,720
Art Bomb Biscuit, thank you.

1354
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,720
What a name.

1355
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,720
Honestly, you like the French tip?

1356
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,720
Is this dinner for you?

1357
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,720
That's right.

1358
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,720
Where other VTubers don't provide, I come sweeping in on week one.

1359
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,720
Week one, I give you what you seek.

1360
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,720
He really is a connoisseur.

1361
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,720
How's the winded tour doing?

1362
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,720
I had to take painkillers because it's getting a bit sore.

1363
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,720
I may or may not be making a doctor's appointment about my toe.

1364
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,720
Because something...

1365
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,720
I'm going to see what happens.

1366
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:08,720
I'm going to go for a bath after the stream and let it sweat it out, like in the hot water.

1367
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:15,720
In Vulcan, Black Blood, Zafarian, Jacob of Thru.

1368
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,720
I still forgot this is week one.

1369
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,720
I mean technical, well, we're just entered week two, I guess.

1370
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:26,720
But if YouTube stats updated immediately, we would have been monetized day one.

1371
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,720
But it took a whole week for it to thingy.

1372
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,720
This is week two, my apology.

1373
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,720
Fee.

1374
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,720
Yes.

1375
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,720
Fee.

1376
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,720
I'm so sorry if you don't like immersion breaking.

1377
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,720
Although I am literally as white as night.

1378
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,720
I'm actually, I'm so white, I'm transparent.

1379
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,720
What the heck did I just move there?

1380
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,720
You can literally see my veins in the blue.

1381
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,720
You didn't know veins are blue.

1382
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,720
They carry deoxygenated blood back to your heart.

1383
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:55,720
They also have back blow valves, which are really good.

1384
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,720
It stops the blood from going backwards in your system.

1385
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,720
Because if your blood ever goes backwards, that's very, very, very bad.

1386
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:09,720
Yeah, you're probably not going to make it if your blood starts going backwards.

1387
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,720
Strunnies, paralysis and everything.

1388
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,720
Yes.

1389
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,720
And then your arteries are what the little red veins are.

1390
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,720
All the redness.

1391
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,720
That's pushing oxygenated blood to where it's needed.

1392
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,720
And then your circulatory system takes care of the rest.

1393
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,720
It's really quite fascinating.

1394
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,720
You could also talk about the heart.

1395
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,720
If you like.

1396
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,720
Today, thank you for signing up.

1397
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,720
Oh, you've got a banding of Isaac.

1398
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,720
This, what's that, X?

1399
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,720
The fucking laser one.

1400
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,720
That's a...

1401
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,720
Sass and frizz.

1402
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,720
That's swine up.

1403
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,720
You guys really Pokemon and video game pictures.

1404
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,720
That's quite cool.

1405
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,720
Thank you for signing up.

1406
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,720
Your feet are beautiful.

1407
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,720
Don't worry.

1408
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,720
Theans, yeah.

1409
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,720
You like seeing the deoxygenated blood pumping through these veins?

1410
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,720
I can't wait for you to play Binding of Isaac.

1411
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,720
November, I'm just warning you all right now.

1412
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,720
November is when Binding of Isaac's 10-year anniversary is

1413
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,720
and Molly Player is unlocked.

1414
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,720
I am not going to be off that from...

1415
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,720
You can see my hands in the shadow.

1416
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,720
I am instructing you.

1417
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:27,720
I am not going to be off that game for a very long time.

1418
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,720
Okay?

1419
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,720
Do you understand?

1420
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,720
Refling.

1421
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,720
And then you all say I understand.

1422
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,720
Mame in unison.

1423
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,720
Okay?

1424
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,720
We're going to be playing multiplayer Isaac all day long.

1425
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,720
Multiple days.

1426
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,720
Am I even...

1427
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:48,720
Am I even commit to a week and alienate more people with my Binding of Isaac?

1428
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,720
Just so you understand.

1429
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,720
But thank you all for signing off.

1430
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,720
I understand.

1431
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,720
I understand, Mame.

1432
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,720
I understand, Mame.

1433
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,720
I understand.

1434
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,720
Yes.

1435
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,720
Good reflings.

1436
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,720
Good reflings.

1437
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,720
You will be rewarded for your...

1438
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,720
Sorry, I didn't realize how much my shadow was casting over.

1439
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,720
You will be rewarded.

1440
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,720
Wait, if you can see my shadow...

1441
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,720
No, we'll do that in a membership.

1442
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,720
That was a very bad idea.

1443
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,720
That was a terrible idea.

1444
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,720
I don't want any of your little ears cleaned.

1445
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,720
Let me pick up this Q-tip or this ear cleaner.

1446
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,720
Let me just pick up this ear cleaner.

1447
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,720
I understand.

1448
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,720
Right, over here you go.

1449
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,720
Just need to hold it like a bit.

1450
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,720
Oh, I dropped it.

1451
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,720
It's not very good.

1452
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,720
It's actually quite hard to utilize this.

1453
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,720
Put it...

1454
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,720
There we go.

1455
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,720
Right, you ready for some ear cleaning?

1456
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,720
Oh, poor you.

1457
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,720
See, if you get trapped water in your ear, don't worry too much.

1458
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,720
Your ear can expel it at a later time.

1459
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:53,720
Some people actually find that expelling of the water in your ear quite...

1460
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,720
Oh wait, you can't even see me touch the thing.

1461
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,720
This is...

1462
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,720
Right, I'm going to do a basic 101.

1463
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,720
Sorry, I'm a whisper.

1464
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,720
I need a whisper.

1465
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,720
I'm getting too passionate.

1466
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:09,720
I'm going to show you a basic 101 for any ASMR artist that's watching right now.

1467
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,720
Okay?

1468
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,720
And I know this is very hypocritical because I've just bashed the ear about...

1469
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,720
I'm going to teach you this right now live.

1470
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,720
Okay?

1471
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,720
You see this ear?

1472
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,720
Inside this ear?

1473
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,720
This black section?

1474
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,720
This is what you don't do, okay?

1475
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,720
This is what you don't do.

1476
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,720
No ASMRs.

1477
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,720
You go around the microphone.

1478
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,720
Around gently, okay?

1479
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,720
Don't ever touch this bit here.

1480
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,720
That's the microphone, okay?

1481
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,720
But go around the ear.

1482
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,720
Gentle strokes.

1483
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,720
Gentle, gentle, gentle, gentle, okay?

1484
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,720
Gentle strokes.

1485
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,720
That's all you need.

1486
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,720
Just gentle movements.

1487
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,720
Gentle, gentle.

1488
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,720
Okay?

1489
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,720
There, 101 ASMR.

1490
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,720
That's all you need to know.

1491
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:34,720
This, I'm going to try and avoid doing with the toe.

1492
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Just around the ear.

1493
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,720
You don't need to go inside.

1494
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,720
No, no, no, no.

1495
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,720
I know.

1496
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,720
I know you guys like to rush into it, okay?

1497
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,720
Why are you covered in band-aids?

1498
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,720
I caught myself making food.

1499
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,720
I hurt myself on my fingy.

1500
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,720
So I have to put a band-aid on.

1501
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,720
I'm a bit of, which is known as a clutch.

1502
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,720
Thank you.

1503
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,720
I had nothing.

1504
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,720
I drank my karma.

1505
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,720
The ceremony, or Bubba the Great.

1506
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,720
I appreciate it.

1507
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,720
Wait.

1508
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,720
Does that mean you were making food with your foot?

1509
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:23,720
No, this, I got all my toes done at the same time.

1510
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:27,720
But this part, so when you get your toes done,

1511
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,720
they take clippers and they take this like push thing.

1512
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,720
They like pushed all my, like, toe skin back and stuff.

1513
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,720
But this section on this toe, she has cut,

1514
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,720
I was actually kind of sore touching that.

1515
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,720
I'm not even going to lie,

1516
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,720
she cut and sliced into it as she was cutting my toenail.

1517
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,720
And it's quite sore and I'm not really sure what to do.

1518
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:52,720
I've not really experienced such a problem before,

1519
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,720
but we will, we'll be fine.

1520
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,720
I think we'll be okay.

1521
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,720
Thank you, Star Killer, for becoming a member.

1522
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,720
Do you guys want me to flip you instead?

1523
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,720
Wait a minute, I got a freaking tiny...

1524
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,720
Seems like you forgot her pronounce my name from yesterday.

1525
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,720
Spain-ee, lol.

1526
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,720
Spain-ee, that's what I said.

1527
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,720
Anyway, I'm off to work, see you later and congrats on monetization.

1528
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,720
Thank you for the tip and yes, thank you.

1529
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,720
Spain-ee, you could literally hear me like be scared to say it

1530
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,720
because I say it wrong all the time.

1531
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,720
Starny, do you have a stethoscope?

1532
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,720
No, I don't.

1533
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,720
That would be quite the prop for ASMR, honestly,

1534
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,720
having a stethoscope.

1535
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,720
You push back the cuticle, the nail bit cleaner,

1536
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,720
but the actual tool lining is not a cuticle.

1537
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,720
You should probably get it right, Muckers.

1538
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,720
This is great, but I have class now.

1539
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,720
Okay, enjoy class.

1540
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,720
Get educated, get educated, get educated, get through will.

1541
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,720
Epsom salt foot bath, yeah.

1542
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,720
I think I'd make just something like that,

1543
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,720
because it's a wee bit sore.

1544
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,720
I heard someone say use it for heartbeat ASMR.

1545
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,720
Oh, would that even work?

1546
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,720
I don't know, we tried.

1547
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,720
I wouldn't mind buying that prop.

1548
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,720
I will buy that prop with my membership money.

1549
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,720
Thank you, wonderful members.

1550
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,720
I hope we're full of heels, yeah.

1551
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,720
I think we'll be fine, right?

1552
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:33,720
Sorry, let me look at the Q and A questions on marshmallow.

1553
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,720
Congrats on the membership.

1554
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,720
You're the goodest girl around.

1555
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,720
What is your favourite meal to eat?

1556
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,720
Savery, something savory.

1557
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:45,720
Hello, will Patreon subs get to see the membership streams on Patreon?

1558
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,720
Nope, they are two different subscriptions.

1559
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,720
Patreon and YouTube activity are two separate things.

1560
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,720
So, if you're interested in seeing your girl,

1561
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,720
your Oshidevs live, then that is more YouTube orientated.

1562
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,720
If you're interested in the alternative content

1563
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:07,720
that any member of Veiler offers, that is what is on Patreon.

1564
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,720
Thank you for your question.

1565
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,720
You have big feet for a woman.

1566
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,720
Okay, wow.

1567
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,720
I don't know what you want me to do with that.

1568
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,720
You may sign up for basketball.

1569
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,720
Right, sorry, let me just end the stream.

1570
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,720
I'm going to contact NBA.

1571
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,720
Big feet?

1572
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,720
You think I have big feet?

1573
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:27,720
Are you sure it's not perspective,

1574
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,720
because you have nothing else to judge?

1575
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,720
Literally, what?

1576
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,720
Big feet is good.

1577
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,720
Your feet are great.

1578
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,720
Literally, everyone's been saying my feet are cute and stuff,

1579
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,720
and then you come to me and you're like, yeah, your feet are massive.

1580
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,720
I'm sorry, do you want me to bind them?

1581
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,720
Like, we're in fucking China or something?

1582
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,720
Like, back when they used to bind the lowest feet?

1583
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,720
Is that what you want?

1584
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,720
You want a little fucking lowest feet?

1585
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,720
Get out of here with that shit.

1586
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,720
I don't know anything about feet, but they're normal feet.

1587
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,720
Yeah, I'm just like...

1588
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,720
Like, oh, sorry, excuse me.

1589
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,720
Oh, I see.

1590
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,720
When I spawned in, when I spawned in,

1591
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,720
I actually picked the foot size manually.

1592
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,720
You know, there's a little slider bar and everything.

1593
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,720
Banana for scale.

1594
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,720
I don't even have bananas.

1595
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:13,720
Oh, do you want my stoop waffle that I ate yesterday for scale?

1596
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,720
There, there's your scale.

1597
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,720
Your stoop waffle.

1598
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,720
Your fear.

1599
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,720
Thank you.

1600
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,720
No sense of permanence.

1601
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:25,720
I'm just going to assume you're a talking pair of feet, honestly.

1602
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,720
Who said that?

1603
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,720
Who?

1604
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,720
I don't know.

1605
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,720
What feet size are you?

1606
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:33,720
I actually don't know.

1607
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:34,720
I've not bought...

1608
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,720
I bought...

1609
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,720
When did I buy a new pair of shoes?

1610
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,720
I completely forgot.

1611
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,720
I had to get measured for them actually when I got a new pair of shoes

1612
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:47,720
because I didn't know what my shoe size was.

1613
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,720
I don't know what to say here, to be honest,

1614
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,720
but I'm glad for Shibi Dome Momaya.

1615
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,720
She's really cute and the gap was really nice.

1616
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,720
Sorry, Stroney.

1617
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,720
And the year-long wait was worth it.

1618
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,720
Aw, I'm glad to think so.

1619
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:01,720
Yeah.

1620
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,720
Some people were asking, like,

1621
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:05,720
weren't you worried about, like,

1622
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,720
everyone being disappointed after a year's wait?

1623
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,720
And I'm like, I'm sorry,

1624
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,720
but if you're, if you're a wifelin',

1625
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,720
you knew what, you knew we were mean men.

1626
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,720
You knew I was rambling.

1627
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,720
You knew exactly what was going on.

1628
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,720
Merci.

1629
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,720
When are you doing your membership stream

1630
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,720
for no particular reason?

1631
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,720
Star Killer, thank you.

1632
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,720
Nayudi Julie, thank you.

1633
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,720
Swirly Lexa 6.

1634
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,720
You have...

1635
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,720
Thank you for signing up.

1636
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,720
Your profile picture around me,

1637
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,720
I could have bought a frickin' hypno thing

1638
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,720
and put it on the floor and hypnotise people to my feet.

1639
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:45,720
My feet?

1640
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,720
They're gonna be so funny though.

1641
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,720
I can't put it off.

1642
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,720
Jesus.

1643
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,720
Fuckin'...

1644
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,720
Okay, that's a bit too hard.

1645
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,720
We're squishing the ball.

1646
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,720
We're going back to squishing the ball.

1647
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,720
It's so easy to squish a ball.

1648
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,720
Feet cam...

1649
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,720
Feet stream Q&A.

1650
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,720
Will you ever beat the Peeler Alligator?

1651
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,720
I don't think so.

1652
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,720
So when the girls started posting it for free,

1653
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:23,720
I was like,

1654
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,720
oh, I was gonna do a donut-on-reward

1655
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,720
where I wrap my 3D weapon like a poly bag,

1656
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,720
like a plastic bag,

1657
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,720
hypnotising the reefing through your feet

1658
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,720
to convince them I worshipped the feet, honestly.

1659
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,720
Goes in a straw knee stream.

1660
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,720
Your feet are big, good for gathering produce all day.

1661
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,720
So, literally, I was like,

1662
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,720
I've never seen you in my life.

1663
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,720
And now you want to do it for free?

1664
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,720
Yeah.

1665
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,720
I was gonna make it a fun donut-on-reward

1666
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,720
because I was gonna do it on 3D all night.

1667
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,720
But I need to wrap it up to make sure it doesn't,

1668
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,720
you know, short circuit.

1669
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,720
What is this about being in a bag?

1670
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,720
Might need that stream.

1671
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,720
Hey.

1672
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,720
Oh, reefing.

1673
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,720
Oh, what a pee.

1674
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,720
Peas on you.

1675
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,720
You still can.

1676
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,720
Wow.

1677
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,720
3D MoMA?

1678
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,720
That's terrible, honestly.

1679
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,720
Oh, my, like, donut-on-plans are absolutely outrageous.

1680
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,720
Someone says,

1681
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,720
hi, love you.

1682
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,720
That's all.

1683
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,720
Love you, reefing.

1684
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,720
Someone says, Pokemon or Digimon?

1685
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,720
I only saw Pokemon.

1686
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,720
I never got into Digimon.

1687
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,720
Because wasn't the Digimon meme

1688
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,720
that's literally, like,

1689
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,720
this, like, cute adorable thing

1690
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,720
ends up developing, like, an AK-47.

1691
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,720
And, like, a galeel on one arm,

1692
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,720
a Famous on the other.

1693
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,720
The only big thing Strenny has

1694
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,720
is her...

1695
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,720
her...

1696
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,720
her heart.

1697
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,720
She has a really big heart.

1698
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,720
Hearing your feet sweat

1699
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,720
stick to the ball

1700
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,720
reminds me of ear coughing

1701
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,720
when the hand leaves the ear.

1702
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,720
Oh, stop.

1703
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,720
Wait, I think my feet are sweating

1704
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,720
off to do your Pokemon vlog.

1705
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,720
What does this sound like?

1706
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,720
Oh, that's great.

1707
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,720
Oh, you actually like it?

1708
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,720
Thank you, Destiny, to enjoy your cave.

1709
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,720
It sounds nice.

1710
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,720
Pokemon vlog.

1711
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,720
Can I do two at...

1712
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,720
Can I do both?

1713
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,720
Hold on.

1714
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:48,720
I think I can do the Joe-Wheeled ear cupping.

1715
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,720
Oh, sorry, I just peaked the audio.

1716
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,720
It's a bit more difficult this way.

1717
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,720
It sounds good.

1718
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,720
Wait, there really are sticking to the ear.

1719
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,720
Did you miss the Pop Rock segment

1720
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,720
where I proved how sweaty my feet are

1721
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,720
via Pop Rocking?

1722
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,720
I just realized the mic is swapped.

1723
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,720
Is it?

1724
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,720
Oh, no.

1725
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,720
Is it on the wrong side?

1726
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,720
I can swap it out manually if you want.

1727
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,720
Peaking the audio just means you're peeking.

1728
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,720
You want to hear my heartbeat from my foot?

1729
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,720
I don't know if I can do that.

1730
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,720
I don't think you can hear it.

1731
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,720
I go here 10 minutes ago.

1732
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,720
Yeah, the start of the stream.

1733
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,720
I may or may not have opened up Pop Rocks

1734
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,720
and put them on the soles of my feet

1735
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,720
to prove how sweaty my feet are.

1736
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,720
And they popped.

1737
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,720
No outside influence necessary.

1738
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:03,720
So I have proven that I do have hyperhydrolysis.

1739
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,720
Not that anyone needed proof.

1740
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,720
I don't know why you would make up such an accusation

1741
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,720
in all honesty.

1742
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,720
Why would anyone want it?

1743
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:16,720
Thank you, glacial soles.

1744
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,720
Yeah.

1745
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,720
Oh, tapping ASMR.

1746
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,720
So fancy.

1747
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,720
I get sweaty feet too, yeah.

1748
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,720
Just as a mild warning to anyone who's listening,

1749
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,720
if you have permanent sweaty hands and feet,

1750
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,720
please do consider autism.

1751
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,720
That's all, that's my note.

1752
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,720
Can we do toe tapping ASMR?

1753
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,720
Oh, yes.

1754
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,720
Yes, it's actually a very common satrate

1755
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,720
of having autism

1756
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,720
by having permanently sweaty hands and feet.

1757
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,720
What if you have hairy palms?

1758
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,720
I don't actually know.

1759
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,720
Maybe you're Italian, because aren't Italians hairy?

1760
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,720
I am acoustic.

1761
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,720
Oh, that explains a lot actually.

1762
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:21,720
Yeah.

1763
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,720
We have strong autism though.

1764
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,720
Little toe tapping ASMR, that's right.

1765
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,720
That's right.

1766
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
Average VTuber will recharge thousands for this

1767
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,720
in a donor phone.

1768
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,720
Me, you get it for free.

1769
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,720
I never noticed it until you actually mentioned it,

1770
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,720
but yeah, I do have autism and sweaty hands and feet.

1771
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,720
Yeah, it's a very common trait.

1772
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,720
If you are...

1773
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,720
Depending on the scale, however you want to scale,

1774
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,720
you can do it different ways,

1775
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,720
but if you are on the high need side of autism,

1776
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,720
if you do toe walking only,

1777
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,720
that is a massive indicator, a humongous indicator

1778
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,720
that you are kind of on the upper scale

1779
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,720
of the present needs.

1780
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,720
Thank you, Jin Azuru channel.

1781
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,720
And thank you, Krax.

1782
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:14,720
Krax.

1783
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,720
I used to have...

1784
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,720
I have to use antiperspirant on my feet anytime I had,

1785
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,720
otherwise it's blistering.

1786
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,720
Huh, I never noticed that before,

1787
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:26,720
but you're right about the sweaty feet.

1788
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,720
Yeah.

1789
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,720
The toe walking is too real.

1790
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,720
Toe walking is a humongous indicator

1791
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,720
that the child, that normally it's noticed in childhood,

1792
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:41,720
you can unlearn it as you get older,

1793
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,720
but it's a massive indicator.

1794
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,720
I used to toe walk all the time.

1795
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,720
Yes, it is one of the biggest giveaways

1796
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,720
of a child's autistic,

1797
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,720
basically, if they toe walk.

1798
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,720
Got used to some powers for goods.

1799
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,720
Literally, well, like, without mine,

1800
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,720
like, I had...

1801
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,720
I stopped at VTubers, I've been stroking my ego.

1802
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,720
They're like, I don't know how you do it.

1803
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,720
I don't know how you stream.

1804
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,720
I'm like, do I tell them the truth

1805
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,720
and the reason I can stream all the time

1806
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,720
is because I have to?

1807
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,720
Or am I just like, oh, I'm just really passionate.

1808
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,720
I just really like what I get to do.

1809
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,720
For me, it's always sitting in weird ways

1810
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,720
that put so much pressure on my feet

1811
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,720
that I keep getting callused feet.

1812
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:31,720
I toe run, is that similar?

1813
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,720
Toe running, maybe isn't the biggest indicator

1814
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:37,720
in children, but then like,

1815
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,720
you can start getting stimulated.

1816
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,720
She's unstoppable.

1817
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,720
I walked on toes as a child

1818
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,720
and then my feet are...

1819
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,720
Don't be shy, you can finish the rest of your sentence.

1820
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,720
We don't bite here.

1821
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,720
We don't bite from around these folks.

1822
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,720
I got...

1823
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,720
Do you remember that South Park episode about us?

1824
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,720
This is enough toe tapping.

1825
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:02,720
What else can I do?

1826
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:03,720
I freaking...

1827
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,720
I've brought this stick in.

1828
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,720
Some people, like, wouldn't stick ASMR.

1829
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:10,720
I've never particularly found it easy to record it.

1830
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,720
So the only thing I can do really is just tapping,

1831
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,720
like, on the ear.

1832
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,720
Any other major indications of tism?

1833
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,720
There's time.

1834
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,720
I don't know.

1835
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,720
Any other major indications of tism?

1836
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,720
There's tons, like,

1837
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,720
stimming with hands, lack of eye contact is a big one.

1838
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,720
My biggest question to you,

1839
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,720
if you're sitting here and you're like,

1840
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:41,720
hold on a minute, she's starting to...

1841
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,720
she's spitting the truth.

1842
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,720
My biggest question, if you genuinely are like,

1843
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,720
huh, is how different would the world look

1844
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,720
if everyone thought like you?

1845
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,720
How different would the world look

1846
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:53,720
if everyone thought like you?

1847
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,720
And before you're like,

1848
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,720
that's not an indication,

1849
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,720
just think about it a bit more.

1850
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,720
Okay, just think a little bit deeper into that question.

1851
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,720
Okay?

1852
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,720
Anyway, gifts are messed up.

1853
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,720
Everyone's getting tier two, one dollar

1854
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,720
for something we really wanted, so why?

1855
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,720
One more dollar for something we really wanted, so why?

1856
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,720
Wait, was that because...

1857
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,720
Oh wait, is this an old...

1858
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,720
Sorry, this might be an old message.

1859
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,720
Hold on.

1860
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,720
Sorry, I'm reading...

1861
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,720
I'm so happy to have you back.

1862
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,720
I miss you so much.

1863
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,720
I miss you too a lot recently.

1864
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,720
Okay, yeah, sorry.

1865
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,720
Those were old ones talking about the tier.

1866
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,720
Thank you for anyone's info about the tiers.

1867
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,720
World ends up addicted to watching VLM.

1868
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,720
That's how we take over.

1869
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,720
You guys thought my hypnosis was to drown you all?

1870
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,720
No, it was to...

1871
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,720
I don't know.

1872
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,720
Oh my god, my feet are sometimes so dirty.

1873
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,720
I'm gonna put your mops on to protect you

1874
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,720
because I'm probably gonna mess up shortly.

1875
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,720
I can get a bit of a mint.

1876
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,720
Right, let's see where we are.

1877
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,720
What?

1878
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,720
You're the strongest, at least mentally,

1879
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,720
I don't know about physically,

1880
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,720
like me who struggled to open a can of fizzy juice

1881
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,720
on the hand-cam stream.

1882
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,720
Eep.

1883
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,720
Can I buy or use Band-Aids to put on an alt-art?

1884
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,720
This one literally has gunk on it.

1885
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,720
I don't know what's going on with this toe,

1886
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,720
but we'll figure it out.

1887
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,720
Girl I've ever known.

1888
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,720
But someone like you should never mess with infections,

1889
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,720
get that toe-checked ace up.

1890
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,720
Oh, Monka Ace, okay.

1891
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,720
If you had to take painkillers, you can go to the ER,

1892
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,720
but I know you'll never do it because you're a sweetheart,

1893
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,720
but somebody else could sue that pedicure.

1894
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,720
Oh no, she didn't mean it.

1895
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,720
You should at least show them the medical papers

1896
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,720
you get from the hospital.

1897
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,720
Monka Ace, am I going to the hospital because of my toe?

1898
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:12,720
I'll tell you what, I'll update you some Twitter after my bath.

1899
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,720
I'll do a salt plingy and see what happens,

1900
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,720
because salt normally makes up.

1901
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:23,720
Would you be interested in playing Omega Strikers on stream?

1902
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:28,720
It's a 3v3 mob-style air hockey that's free to play.

1903
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,720
Oh my god, that sounds fun.

1904
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,720
Omega Strikers.

1905
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:40,720
Thank you, whoa, and thank you, Panopetition.

1906
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,720
Oh my god, Omega Strikers looks so cool.

1907
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,720
All their waifus are cute.

1908
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,720
Isn't this free to play?

1909
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,720
Oh no, it's Nintendo.

1910
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,720
Oh no.

1911
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,720
It's Nintendo.

1912
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,720
Nintendo's so expensive.

1913
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,720
Is it Nintendo?

1914
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:11,720
Oh yeah.

1915
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,720
Oh no, this can't be.

1916
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,720
This can't be, it can't be Nintendo.

1917
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,720
Why does it say Nintendo on the top now?

1918
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,720
It's on PC.

1919
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,720
Oh okay, it's on PC.

1920
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,720
Right, whoa, okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1921
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,720
If it's on PC, it can't be overcharged that much.

1922
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,720
If anything is specifically published by Nintendo,

1923
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,720
just know you're going to get rinsed out ours for the price.

1924
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,720
It's absolutely ridiculous.

1925
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,720
Wait, I can see that.

1926
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,720
It showed up.

1927
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,720
Panoptition.

1928
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,720
Panoption, thank you so much for, oh my goodness,

1929
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,720
all those gifted memberships.

1930
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,720
Whoa, wait a minute.

1931
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:51,720
Stream Elements is assigning your gifts in real time.

1932
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,720
I can see who's been gifted your gifts.

1933
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,720
Thank you so much.

1934
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,720
Congrats to everyone who managed to catch that.

1935
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,720
You do have to enable it in chat.

1936
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,720
I'm so sorry, I can hardly say the name.

1937
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:06,720
Panoptition, surely it's Panoptition.

1938
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,720
Panoptition, thank you so much for the 20 gifted, thank you.

1939
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,720
And congrats to everyone who caught up with their face.

1940
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,720
It's all coming together.

1941
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,720
Yes, you'll have to like, I think you have to talk in chat

1942
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,720
or even if you just say a simple message like hi

1943
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,720
and then it'll be like you could have got this, enable it.

1944
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,720
I love you.

1945
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,720
Will you go on a date with me?

1946
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,720
You better come to the convention.

1947
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,720
I'm giving everyone roses.

1948
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,720
I think if we ever did like an actual convention,

1949
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,720
I'd love to buy like single roses so I can give it out

1950
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,720
and I'll be like, ha, that's right.

1951
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:49,720
You have beat all the odds of a man never receiving a flower

1952
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,720
before he is.

1953
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,720
Hold on, let me hydrate, let me hydrate.

1954
01:31:55,720 --> 01:32:04,720
Well, convention where?

1955
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,720
No, there's been no picked convention,

1956
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:10,720
but I really want to try it once in my life.

1957
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,720
I've never been to a convention before.

1958
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:15,720
I've never been to like a location that has been

1959
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:20,720
self-identified for nerds and dorks like us.

1960
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:24,720
So it would be a very unique experience.

1961
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:29,720
Wow, that is like literally real-time assigning gifted

1962
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,720
memberships.

1963
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,720
That's crazy.

1964
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,720
That's so cool.

1965
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,720
Viola Conta.

1966
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:41,720
Well, the only thing is I have absolutely crippling,

1967
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:44,720
traveling anxiety, which is a bit of a problem.

1968
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:48,720
There's a big convention in California, I think,

1969
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,720
and a lot of the girls would actually be able to make it

1970
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,720
manually, I think, if we all went.

1971
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:58,720
But I don't want to let the team down.

1972
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:03,720
There's a lot of issues about getting on a plane.

1973
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:07,720
And I get violently motion sick as well.

1974
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:11,720
This is why I just want to farm with a U-reflink,

1975
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:14,720
because I can't travel anywhere.

1976
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:19,720
I get so sick, like I had to get a taxi.

1977
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,720
I get a taxi to my dentist appointment.

1978
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,720
And it's not even that far away from me.

1979
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,720
I was violently ill.

1980
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,720
I was like, ooh.

1981
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,720
I was like, can I just put the window down?

1982
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,720
And the guy's like, yeah, yeah.

1983
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,720
He's like on his phone talking to his pal and all that.

1984
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,720
I'm getting scared.

1985
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,720
Oh.

1986
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:42,720
I would use thank you, Nero, for becoming a member.

1987
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,720
I can see that.

1988
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,720
Get drunk and pass out on the plane, honestly.

1989
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,720
I would be so high on medication.

1990
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,720
See, the problem is I don't want to be like,

1991
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,720
I'm definitely going to a convention,

1992
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,720
because I have A-bomb.

1993
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,720
And A-bomb really messes up things that happen in real life.

1994
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,720
And I don't want to be like, oh, you should go to this convention

1995
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,720
in Melbourne on this day at this time.

1996
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,720
I'll be here, because I don't want anyone to spend money

1997
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12,720
to come out on the sole reason to come see me type thing.

1998
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:16,720
Because if my freaking A-bomb gets in the way,

1999
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:20,720
I, oh wait, I'll tell it in another stream, okay?

2000
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,720
But I have a really freaking, it's really frustrating,

2001
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,720
but it's quite humorous at the same time.

2002
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,720
But yeah, you could be the one of those robots that meet up.

2003
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,720
Yeah, that's possible.

2004
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,720
First Mercy next round.

2005
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,720
Do all the girls have motion sickness?

2006
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,720
Oh no, I can still play video games.

2007
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:38,720
I have like travel motion sickness.

2008
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,720
Like a parent.

2009
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,720
Oh wait, no.

2010
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,720
She put those goofy goggles on her eyes.

2011
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,720
I'm pretty sure she did.

2012
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,720
No, you're right about Mercy.

2013
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,720
She put those funny goggles on her eyes.

2014
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,720
What is A-bomb?

2015
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,720
A-bomb stands for anxiety,

2016
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,720
because people are sick of hearing about it,

2017
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,720
like the word anxiety.

2018
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:00,720
So I just call it A-bomb as a substitute.

2019
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,720
It's ear problems?

2020
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:07,720
Oh, well I can fix your ear problems with my sweaty feet.

2021
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:10,720
Oh yes, oh yes, you can hear that.

2022
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,720
There's a little tool rubbing ASMR.

2023
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:18,720
Yeah, that's right, a little rubber.

2024
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,720
Maybe you don't see that on airport.

2025
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:26,720
Oh no, yeah, we're not going to use that terminology.

2026
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,720
I think Johnny can fix their ear problems on his Patreon.

2027
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:37,720
I mean your motion sickness, sorry.

2028
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,720
Do you take game suggestions?

2029
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,720
I do, I have absolutely no issues.

2030
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,720
A lot of streamers kind of don't...

2031
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:47,720
No, that's not nice.

2032
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:48,720
I will not generalise.

2033
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,720
Please don't be afraid to...

2034
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,720
Dap your bucket, thank you for becoming a member.

2035
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,720
Please don't be afraid to, you know, ask me questions,

2036
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:00,720
or game suggestions are perfectly fine with me,

2037
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,720
I have no problems.

2038
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,720
Is that how many people use A-bomb as a word

2039
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,720
for being mildly introverted?

2040
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:16,720
Yes, I kind of generally touch up on the subject

2041
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,720
just because I am very thankful to be where I am

2042
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,720
versus where I was,

2043
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,720
but I feel like people are so tired

2044
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,720
and burned out hearing about it and like,

2045
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,720
oh everyone's got it.

2046
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,720
And I'm like, yeah, I wonder everyone's got it.

2047
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:31,720
Have you seen society today?

2048
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,720
We live in a society, I wonder everyone's got it.

2049
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,720
Anyway, we can do that.

2050
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,720
I can talk about that in another stream.

2051
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:40,720
This stream is supposed to be me celebrating monetisation

2052
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,720
and yet again I'm talking about

2053
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,720
how we need the downfall of society.

2054
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,720
It's terrible.

2055
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,720
It's shocking.

2056
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,720
I've got his DEMPA in here,

2057
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,720
no way DEMPA is in here staring at my toes right now.

2058
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,720
Oh, gorgeous.

2059
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,720
Hi DEMPA, I have no idea what size my feet are.

2060
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,720
I bought like new shoes last year

2061
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,720
and they had to measure them

2062
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:05,720
and I already forgot my shoes aren't in this room.

2063
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,720
Sorry DEMPA, I had to be this way.

2064
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:11,720
I literally am, I had to be this way.

2065
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,720
Yeah DEMPA, you should do foot cam ASMR with me.

2066
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,720
You want to come over?

2067
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:22,720
I feel like you would have smaller toes than me.

2068
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,720
I've never had a pedicure before.

2069
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,720
Oh, well if you ever get one,

2070
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,720
just make sure they don't mess up your toe by the way

2071
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,720
because mine's an agony.

2072
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:34,720
You definitely need to be careful with that.

2073
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,720
Here's my beefling heart.

2074
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:41,720
The world is, there's no surprise.

2075
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,720
I have a broken pinky toe,

2076
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:45,720
can you like spread your little,

2077
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,720
look at my pinky toe, it's a little dance.

2078
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:54,720
I don't want someone to touch my feet.

2079
01:37:54,720 --> 01:38:00,720
Getting a massage is very unique sensation.

2080
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,720
Very, very unique sensation.

2081
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:05,720
DEMPA, I've got a strange feeling somewhere.

2082
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:10,720
Poor DEMPA's pinky toe.

2083
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,720
Are there any game genres you want to avoid?

2084
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,720
I don't like, oh this is going to be controversial.

2085
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,720
I might filter some people with this one.

2086
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:23,720
The reason, I do not like games like Resident Evil

2087
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,720
where you give me ammunition,

2088
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,720
but it does not perish the enemy.

2089
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,720
Do not give me enemies that cannot be perished.

2090
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:35,720
What is the point in having an ammunition resource management section

2091
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:38,720
if it does not perish the big bad enemy?

2092
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,720
Please do not suggest these kinds of games.

2093
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,720
It will turn into a rage stream real quick

2094
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:47,720
and I will become so scots you will not actually be able to understand them.

2095
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,720
I'm sorry, but do not give me ammunition if it does not perish then.

2096
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:51,720
Simple as.

2097
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,720
I mean, that's fair.

2098
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:54,720
Preach.

2099
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,720
Did you put hydrogen peroxide on it?

2100
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,720
No, I'm going to take a bath.

2101
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:01,720
I'm going to take this off and go for a bath

2102
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,720
and do salt in the bath.

2103
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:09,720
You mean like that 30 bullets to kill that one enemy?

2104
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:10,720
Yeah.

2105
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,720
I'm sure the Resident Evil games are good.

2106
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,720
However, I have fantastic news.

2107
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,720
I have five gen mates that are more than likely to play that kind of genre.

2108
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,720
I've never played Resident Evil.

2109
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:26,720
I watched my dad play Resident Evil

2110
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,720
and it started off in Africa,

2111
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,720
but he couldn't even get through it

2112
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:33,720
and we were both watching it and we were like,

2113
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,720
well, I was watching him play it

2114
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,720
and both of us were looking at each other like,

2115
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:38,720
what is this?

2116
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,720
He couldn't get through it.

2117
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,720
I couldn't get through it.

2118
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,720
Oh, Res Fat.

2119
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,720
Yeah, it was like set in Africa or something.

2120
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,720
It was like super hot Savannah type thing.

2121
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:53,720
And both of us were just staring at each other like,

2122
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:56,720
this is the biggest piece that we've ever bought.

2123
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,720
Because normally we play games together,

2124
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,720
share games together type thing.

2125
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,720
You watch your dad play the second worst one.

2126
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,720
Oh, well, there you go.

2127
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,720
Literally, I think we've got 20 minutes into it

2128
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,720
and both of us were looking at each other like,

2129
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,720
yeah, that game's going back.

2130
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,720
We're going to hand it in for a different game.

2131
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:18,720
Is there something you've always wanted to try

2132
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,720
that you've made for 100% games that you've never wanted to try?

2133
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:26,720
I've wanted to play Civ 6.

2134
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,720
I have done one run on it

2135
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,720
and I enjoyed it, but I was very dumb.

2136
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,720
I don't want to play Baldur's Gate.

2137
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,720
I definitely want to try that for the first time.

2138
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,720
But I think it will be a patience testing stream

2139
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:43,720
because I get worried about playing a game for the first time.

2140
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:49,720
Five and six are some of the best solve ones, regardless.

2141
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,720
Wow, feet for free.

2142
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,720
Congrats on monetization.

2143
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,720
Ding!

2144
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,720
Let's just make sure I didn't lose anything.

2145
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,720
Right, I think I won.

2146
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,720
This one says, I think your feet are very beautiful and hot.

2147
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,720
Thanks. Do you have my toes?

2148
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,720
I got my toes done.

2149
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,720
Look at that step piece.

2150
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:11,720
Look at that side profile on the toe spread.

2151
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,720
Can I just get a zoom in and appreciation

2152
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,720
for the side profile of the toe spread?

2153
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,720
Yeah.

2154
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,720
I mean, look at that.

2155
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,720
You already know. You're welcome.

2156
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,720
Yeah, you're welcome. You owe me one membership.

2157
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,720
You're welcome.

2158
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,720
The new Baldur's Gate?

2159
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,720
Yeah, I've never played the Baldur's Gate, apparently.

2160
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,720
Yeah, someone says it's cool, but apparently it's cool.

2161
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,720
Delicious.

2162
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,720
You played any RTS?

2163
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,720
Starcraft?

2164
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,720
No, my dad played it.

2165
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,720
Age of Empires? No.

2166
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,720
Civ 6 is a dumpster fire.

2167
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,720
Is that actually?

2168
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,720
Didn't they not announce there's a new Civ 6 border?

2169
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,720
Yeah, a new Civ coming out.

2170
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:56,720
Long toes.

2171
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,720
Wait, they actually have long toes.

2172
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,720
Stop. Do I have long toes?

2173
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,720
There you go. I'm going to start again.

2174
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:03,720
Hold on. I'm going to get that really right.

2175
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:04,720
Hold on.

2176
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,720
I don't know.

2177
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,720
I feel like I have the toe...

2178
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:09,720
Because you can have...

2179
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,720
Some people have toes that...

2180
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,720
Oh, wait. Sorry. You can't see any of them.

2181
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,720
Hold on. Let's try it again.

2182
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,720
Some people have toes where they are all the same size.

2183
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,720
They are all the same length.

2184
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,720
They come across like that.

2185
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,720
Mainly the...

2186
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,720
That shape?

2187
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,720
I don't know if that makes any sense.

2188
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:27,720
You feel cute.

2189
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:28,720
Your toes are cute.

2190
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,720
I'm going to start getting a complex about my freaking toes.

2191
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,720
You don't...

2192
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,720
Right. How long are my toes?

2193
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,720
We'll do it in inches because you're all American.

2194
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:40,720
You said 2.5 inches is...

2195
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,720
Wait, hold on.

2196
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:44,720
I'm trying to show you and do it at the same time.

2197
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,720
Where is 2.5?

2198
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,720
Where...

2199
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,720
I am...

2200
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:56,720
My index toe is just bigger than an inch.

2201
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,720
Up there.

2202
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,720
Sorry. I just hit the mic.

2203
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:01,720
Oh, you're not American.

2204
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,720
I'm sorry.

2205
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,720
Hold on.

2206
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,720
Okay.

2207
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,720
Roughly...

2208
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,720
3 centimeter toe.

2209
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,720
I got 3 centimeter toe.

2210
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:12,720
I am offended.

2211
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,720
Long toe equals more than joy.

2212
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,720
Well, fuck is an inch.

2213
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,720
3 of these, baby.

2214
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:23,720
Measure the entire foot.

2215
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:24,720
Oh, no.

2216
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,720
But then you will know that I've got big feet.

2217
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,720
Oh, no.

2218
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,720
My foot's bigger than the ruler.

2219
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:32,720
If the ruler goes there, it's like way bigger.

2220
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:35,720
If this ruler is 15 centimeters...

2221
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:36,720
Wait, hold on.

2222
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,720
Let me put it as a thing.

2223
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,720
Okay. Put it on my heel.

2224
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,720
And it's there on my toe.

2225
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:46,720
So I'm like 16 centimeter feet.

2226
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:48,720
Yeah.

2227
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:51,720
Sorry. That was like the most known way to do it.

2228
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,720
But I did it.

2229
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,720
Big feet are good.

2230
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,720
I'm glad you like them.

2231
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,720
But you have not big feet.

2232
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,720
The mic is low.

2233
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:02,720
I don't know.

2234
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:03,720
I might have...

2235
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:07,720
I genuinely thought I was like average on everything.

2236
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,720
But then when I did the sweet-eating cam,

2237
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:11,720
and everyone saw my hands,

2238
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:12,720
they were like,

2239
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:13,720
oh, your hands are so small.

2240
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,720
But when we started measuring it together,

2241
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:16,720
I was like, oh, okay.

2242
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,720
Imagine if this is popped right now,

2243
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,720
because I'm a sweetie.

2244
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:30,720
Can you measure how wide you can spread your big toe?

2245
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,720
And the one next to...

2246
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,720
Wait, how wide?

2247
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,720
I don't know.

2248
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,720
Like, because you could...

2249
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:39,720
Like this?

2250
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,720
Is that what you wanted?

2251
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:41,720
Hold on.

2252
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,720
Okay.

2253
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,720
Thank you, Snowberry sweetie.

2254
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,720
Like that?

2255
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,720
Or do you mean like the actual width?

2256
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,720
I don't know.

2257
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:53,720
It depends.

2258
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,720
It has to be malleable.

2259
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,720
This is course measurement.

2260
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,720
It has to be malleable.

2261
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,720
Like it has to be...

2262
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,720
Because I can grip stuff like...

2263
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,720
Hold on.

2264
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:04,720
Let me just...

2265
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,720
Hold on.

2266
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:06,720
Try moving it a little bit.

2267
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:07,720
There you go.

2268
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:08,720
There you go.

2269
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:09,720
Just pop it there.

2270
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,720
Good boy.

2271
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:11,720
Tap.

2272
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:12,720
Headpats.

2273
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:14,720
This.

2274
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,720
It depends,

2275
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,720
because like that is...

2276
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,720
You know.

2277
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,720
I can put it in between my toes.

2278
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:30,720
In the culture,

2279
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,720
she would have nice grippers

2280
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:34,720
down her renders and chat.

2281
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,720
I guess your feet are small,

2282
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:36,720
but it makes your toes

2283
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,720
really long and compact.

2284
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:38,720
No!

2285
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,720
I'm going to get

2286
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,720
a freaking complex after this dream.

2287
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:42,720
I just thought my feet

2288
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,720
were really normal.

2289
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:46,720
Oh, my cat's meowing.

2290
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:47,720
Did you hear him?

2291
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:50,720
Do you want in?

2292
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:52,720
Did you hear that?

2293
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:54,720
Hold on.

2294
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:56,720
Hold on.

2295
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,720
Let me get him.

2296
01:45:58,720 --> 01:45:59,720
Baby boy.

2297
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,720
You want in?

2298
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,720
Baby boy.

2299
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:05,720
Vigo.

2300
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,720
Vigo.

2301
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,720
You can't just...

2302
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:09,720
Oh.

2303
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:10,720
Gimli.

2304
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:11,720
Gimli,

2305
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:12,720
do you want to come on stream?

2306
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,720
She's so confused right now.

2307
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:17,720
She's like,

2308
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:18,720
what are you doing?

2309
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:19,720
Gimli, come here.

2310
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:21,720
Gimli,

2311
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,720
come right here.

2312
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,720
Come right here.

2313
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:25,720
Show the people

2314
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:26,720
how adorable you are.

2315
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,720
No, that's the wrong way.

2316
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,720
Gimli, what's this?

2317
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:32,720
Gimli.

2318
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,720
Yes.

2319
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,720
Yes.

2320
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:35,720
Okay,

2321
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:36,720
just gently don't knock

2322
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,720
over the webcam

2323
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:38,720
or I'll cry.

2324
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,720
Gimli.

2325
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,720
Don't knock over it.

2326
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:41,720
Right.

2327
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:42,720
Out.

2328
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:43,720
Out.

2329
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:44,720
You're going to knock over the webcam.

2330
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:45,720
Gimli.

2331
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,720
I'm sure.

2332
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:47,720
I've only got 10 more minutes.

2333
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:48,720
I'll be out in a minute, Gimli.

2334
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:50,720
You can't go.

2335
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,720
Give me 10 minutes,

2336
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:53,720
Gimli.

2337
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,720
Just 10 minutes is all I need.

2338
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:55,720
Sorry.

2339
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:56,720
My tree was sweet to hear that.

2340
01:46:58,720 --> 01:46:59,720
Mommy Gimli.

2341
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,720
She was so going to knock over

2342
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,720
that webcam,

2343
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,720
so I was like,

2344
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,720
get out, Gimli.

2345
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,720
I can tell.

2346
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,720
Oh.

2347
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:08,720
Oh, I've done it now.

2348
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:09,720
I haven't off.

2349
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,720
Gimli, 10 minutes.

2350
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,720
And I'm out.

2351
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:14,720
Stop it.

2352
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,720
Your dog is very cute.

2353
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,720
Thank you.

2354
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,720
I've been in...

2355
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,720
I've certified for eight years

2356
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:29,720
for your perfect.

2357
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,720
Thank you.

2358
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:31,720
Literally,

2359
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:32,720
I shouldn't have brought her in

2360
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:33,720
because now she's going to

2361
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:34,720
want the attention.

2362
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:35,720
And I was like,

2363
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:36,720
I'm not finished.

2364
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:37,720
I'm not finished.

2365
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,720
Give me 10 minutes, girls.

2366
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,720
10 minutes of getting

2367
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:41,720
screamed at by a cat.

2368
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:42,720
Literally,

2369
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,720
a cat does not understand

2370
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:45,720
the feed type.

2371
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:48,720
She doesn't have a cat.

2372
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,720
She has 10 doves.

2373
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,720
And that was my Gimli.

2374
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,720
I thought it was my baby boy,

2375
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:57,720
Vigo.

2376
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:01,720
Thank you very much.

2377
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:03,720
Votams.

2378
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,720
And thank you for Rono.

2379
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,720
I appreciate the gifts

2380
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:08,720
and membership.

2381
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:09,720
I could...

2382
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:12,720
Cats and the Feet.

2383
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:13,720
Yes.

2384
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:14,720
I picked up.

2385
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,720
Thank you.

2386
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,720
Caleb Harris as well.

2387
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,720
I adopted Vigo

2388
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:21,720
and Gimli.

2389
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,720
And their starting situations

2390
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,720
are actually really sad,

2391
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,720
but it's a really happy ending.

2392
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,720
So I

2393
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,720
I messaged a shelter

2394
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:29,720
and I was like,

2395
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:30,720
hey,

2396
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,720
I work from home.

2397
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:33,720
I would love to

2398
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:34,720
open up my home

2399
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:35,720
to two cats

2400
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,720
that cannot be separated.

2401
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:37,720
If you didn't know

2402
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,720
for adoption agencies

2403
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:39,720
and all that kind of thing,

2404
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:40,720
it's really hard

2405
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,720
to be home doubles

2406
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,720
that are inseparable.

2407
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,720
So I messaged them

2408
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:48,720
and they came back

2409
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,720
and they were like,

2410
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:51,720
we have these two ruffians.

2411
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:53,720
They have come from

2412
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:54,720
an hoarder's home,

2413
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,720
which makes them un...

2414
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,720
They cannot be

2415
01:48:58,720 --> 01:48:59,720
with any other animal,

2416
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:00,720
but each other.

2417
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:03,720
So I went

2418
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,720
and visited them

2419
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:06,720
and they were these

2420
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,720
poor, scaredy cats.

2421
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:09,720
They genuinely were

2422
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:10,720
so terrified of any humans.

2423
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,720
Thank you, yummy,

2424
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:14,720
for the memba.

2425
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:16,720
Thank you for just like

2426
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,720
remembering as well

2427
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:18,720
for the correct tier.

2428
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,720
I do apologize

2429
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:20,720
about messing up that tier.

2430
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,720
Yes, they're a bonded pair

2431
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:22,720
and they can't be separated.

2432
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:23,720
But I just want to say

2433
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,720
the universe works

2434
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:26,720
in mysterious ways.

2435
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:27,720
Sorry, I know I'm supposed

2436
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:28,720
to be doing ASMR,

2437
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:29,720
but I'm just trying

2438
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:30,720
to call them right now

2439
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,720
without the mic on the floor.

2440
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,720
The world will work

2441
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:34,720
in mysterious ways.

2442
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:35,720
Now I do not believe

2443
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:36,720
in supporting certain

2444
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:38,720
cat breeds,

2445
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:39,720
which are bad for their health.

2446
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:40,720
An example of that

2447
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,720
is the munchkin breed.

2448
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:45,720
Vigo is mixed tabby

2449
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,720
and munchkin breed.

2450
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,720
The universe

2451
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:50,720
will fight

2452
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,720
and the universe

2453
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:52,720
will find ways

2454
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:54,720
to laugh in your face.

2455
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,720
Because I am a big believer

2456
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:58,720
and like completely

2457
01:49:58,720 --> 01:49:59,720
no longer breeding them

2458
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:01,720
and not letting them

2459
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:02,720
be a genetic line

2460
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:03,720
any further

2461
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,720
because it's so bad

2462
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:05,720
for their health.

2463
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:07,720
San Baroli,

2464
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:08,720
thank you very much.

2465
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:10,720
And then the universe

2466
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,720
laughed in my face

2467
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,720
and said,

2468
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:14,720
guess what?

2469
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:15,720
Your baby boy

2470
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,720
is a half-foot

2471
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,720
and I'm like,

2472
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:18,720
okay.

2473
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:19,720
Both of them,

2474
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:20,720
thank you for the upgrade.

2475
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:22,720
So yeah,

2476
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,720
if you ever think

2477
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:25,720
the universe doesn't

2478
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:26,720
have a little joke for you,

2479
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:27,720
oh, I assure you,

2480
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:28,720
the universe is going to,

2481
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,720
it's got a joke for you.

2482
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:32,720
Yeah, like pugs,

2483
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,720
yes, I am a bit of a

2484
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,720
please don't support,

2485
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:37,720
but this was just me,

2486
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:39,720
like Scottish fold cats.

2487
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:41,720
As adorable as they look,

2488
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,720
absolutely not.

2489
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,720
Hairless cats,

2490
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:45,720
absolutely not.

2491
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,720
A lot of people

2492
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:47,720
will say,

2493
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:48,720
but I can look after them.

2494
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,720
It's not about you looking after them.

2495
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,720
It's about the general population

2496
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:53,720
looking after them.

2497
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,720
Does the general population

2498
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,720
going to do all these steps

2499
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:58,720
about looking after their cat

2500
01:50:58,720 --> 01:50:59,720
and the hairless ones

2501
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,720
getting out of bath

2502
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:01,720
and removing the dirt cells

2503
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,720
because it's not got

2504
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:03,720
freaking fur?

2505
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:04,720
No, it's not.

2506
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:05,720
Think of the bigger picture.

2507
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:06,720
It's selfish.

2508
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:07,720
Anyway,

2509
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,720
don't get me started

2510
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:11,720
on animal breeding

2511
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:12,720
because a lot of it

2512
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,720
is just absolutely insane.

2513
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:15,720
I'm waiting until you get started

2514
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:16,720
and learn about

2515
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,720
what pedigree dogs are.

2516
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,720
Pedigree dogs are just certified.

2517
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,720
You'll literally get a certificate

2518
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:24,720
saying, yes, this dog

2519
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,720
has been produced via

2520
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,720
freaking insane amounts of

2521
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:28,720
zest.

2522
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:29,720
And it was like,

2523
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:31,720
why is pedigree even a thing?

2524
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:32,720
Get a mutt.

2525
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:33,720
Muts are the healthiest kind of dog

2526
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,720
you can even get.

2527
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,720
Ah, and mixed breed cats,

2528
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:38,720
they're the healthiest kind

2529
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:39,720
you can get.

2530
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:40,720
Don't support the little munchkins

2531
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,720
that have freaking stilts for legs.

2532
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,720
It's actually so freaking sad.

2533
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,720
And a canny,

2534
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:46,720
oh, oh, I could really start

2535
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,720
fucking beating my back.

2536
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,720
Right, can, can, can, can, can.

2537
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:51,720
Anyway, yeah,

2538
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:52,720
the universe will always

2539
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:53,720
have a joke for you.

2540
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:57,720
So, yeah,

2541
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:00,720
I despise munchkins.

2542
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:01,720
I don't,

2543
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,720
for the, for the kindness

2544
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:03,720
of the poor cat,

2545
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:04,720
they shouldn't be a thing.

2546
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:05,720
And then the universe said,

2547
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:06,720
oh, by the way,

2548
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,720
Vigo is a half mix

2549
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:09,720
of Tabby and munchkin.

2550
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:10,720
And yeah,

2551
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,720
he has saucer eyeballs.

2552
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:13,720
I should actually post

2553
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,720
a picture of my baby

2554
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:16,720
but yeah,

2555
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:18,720
Vigo has saucer eyeballs.

2556
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:19,720
He's so adorable.

2557
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:21,720
And the universe won

2558
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,720
after that.

2559
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,720
Hey,

2560
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:25,720
do you do rabble and

2561
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:26,720
dress streams where you

2562
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,720
just go down a bunch of

2563
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:28,720
rabbit holes?

2564
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,720
Oh, absolutely.

2565
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,720
I did it in my

2566
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:32,720
Skyrim one.

2567
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:33,720
I started talking about

2568
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,720
the needy streamer

2569
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:35,720
overload ending

2570
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:36,720
where she becomes a god

2571
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,720
and starts a new

2572
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,720
religion type thing

2573
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:40,720
or like,

2574
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:41,720
starts a new society.

2575
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,720
And like,

2576
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,720
I started talking

2577
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,720
about conspiracy theories

2578
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,720
and stuff,

2579
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:46,720
but I don't like going too

2580
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:47,720
deep into it

2581
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,720
because I know it like

2582
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,720
really just like

2583
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:50,720
people didn't like it.

2584
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:51,720
So I was like,

2585
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:52,720
okay,

2586
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:53,720
I will maybe do it too much

2587
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:54,720
and so does me.

2588
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,720
My mom used to read

2589
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,720
Labrador's

2590
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:57,720
but regarding cats,

2591
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:58,720
McTess, yeah.

2592
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:01,720
Vigo is just a small rock.

2593
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:02,720
Every scrawny rage

2594
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,720
makes me a lover

2595
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:04,720
even more awe.

2596
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,720
Vigo,

2597
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:06,720
yeah,

2598
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:07,720
Vigo,

2599
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:08,720
my cat sings Vigo after

2600
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:09,720
the guy,

2601
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:10,720
did you know

2602
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,720
and darted the rings

2603
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,720
in the scene

2604
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,720
where he kicks the helmet,

2605
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,720
he was screaming for real.

2606
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,720
Do you want to know

2607
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:20,720
why he screamed out

2608
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:21,720
for real like that?

2609
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,720
Because

2610
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,720
because he actually

2611
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:24,720
booked his poop.

2612
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,720
And yeah,

2613
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:26,720
and yes,

2614
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:27,720
did you name

2615
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:28,720
your cats

2616
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:29,720
after the Lord of the Rings?

2617
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:30,720
Of course I named my cats

2618
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:31,720
after the Lord of the Rings.

2619
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,720
Well,

2620
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:33,720
would I name them

2621
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:34,720
freaking Bill and Ben,

2622
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,720
the flower pot men?

2623
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:36,720
No,

2624
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:37,720
I wouldn't.

2625
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,720
So yeah,

2626
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:40,720
my baby boy,

2627
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:41,720
my baby girl.

2628
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:42,720
And yes,

2629
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:43,720
I gave

2630
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,720
Gimli,

2631
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:46,720
well yeah,

2632
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:47,720
I gave Gimli a boy's name

2633
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:48,720
technically.

2634
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:49,720
But Gimli's got

2635
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,720
ginger on her butt.

2636
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:51,720
So,

2637
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:52,720
Gimli,

2638
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:53,720
my homie now.

2639
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,720
Yeah,

2640
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:55,720
yeah,

2641
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:56,720
name them,

2642
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,720
Bill and Ben,

2643
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:58,720
the flower pot men,

2644
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:59,720
honestly.

2645
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:01,720
Holy crap,

2646
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:02,720
you just maybe remember

2647
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:03,720
Bill and Ben.

2648
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:04,720
I remember Bill and Ben.

2649
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:06,720
JJ,

2650
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,720
you've got a picture of me.

2651
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,720
Thank you for the membership,

2652
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:10,720
JJ.

2653
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:11,720
I appreciate it.

2654
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:13,720
Just for all members

2655
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:14,720
who are watching,

2656
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:16,720
the membership stream

2657
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:17,720
start next week,

2658
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:18,720
but I promise you,

2659
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:19,720
I will throw you into

2660
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:20,720
the thick of it

2661
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:22,720
and we'll

2662
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:23,720
have a lot of fun from there.

2663
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:25,720
We'll take it from there

2664
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:27,720
because this week

2665
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:28,720
is kind of locked

2666
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:29,720
in a little bit.

2667
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:30,720
We do have a collab

2668
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:31,720
again

2669
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:32,720
with me

2670
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:33,720
and all my girls.

2671
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:35,720
You are

2672
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:36,720
an adorable girl.

2673
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:37,720
We love it.

2674
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:41,720
Yes.

2675
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:42,720
What's next?

2676
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:43,720
Was it a gym?

2677
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:44,720
Cute.

2678
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:45,720
Yeah,

2679
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:46,720
I'm not going to get

2680
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:47,720
any more

2681
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,720
putters

2682
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:49,720
after Vigo

2683
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:50,720
and

2684
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:51,720
Gimli.

2685
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:52,720
I think

2686
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:54,720
I will probably

2687
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:55,720
have the biggest

2688
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,720
mental breakdown

2689
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,720
of my life

2690
01:54:58,720 --> 01:54:59,720
once they pass.

2691
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:00,720
Thankfully,

2692
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:01,720
I have them very young.

2693
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:02,720
They,

2694
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,720
I think they're

2695
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:04,720
three years old.

2696
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:06,720
Unfortunately,

2697
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:07,720
due to the hoarder situation,

2698
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:08,720
they actually don't know

2699
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:09,720
what age

2700
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:10,720
my baby boy and baby girl are.

2701
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:12,720
Like,

2702
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:13,720
I was trying to get

2703
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:14,720
as much information

2704
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:15,720
that they had,

2705
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:16,720
but they were just very honest

2706
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:17,720
and said,

2707
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:18,720
like, look,

2708
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:19,720
we don't,

2709
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:20,720
we don't actually

2710
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:21,720
have information

2711
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:22,720
on these babies.

2712
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:25,720
Strani,

2713
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:26,720
do you know

2714
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,720
if you get a cut

2715
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,720
of YouTube Premium membership

2716
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:29,720
watchers?

2717
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:30,720
I absolutely do.

2718
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:33,720
If you pay for YouTube,

2719
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:34,720
oh, it used to be called

2720
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,720
YouTube Red,

2721
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,720
but if you do

2722
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:37,720
YouTube Premium,

2723
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:40,720
forever,

2724
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,720
however long you watch it,

2725
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,720
like, I get a percentage.

2726
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:45,720
So say you 100%

2727
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:46,720
watched me.

2728
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:47,720
I get 100%

2729
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:48,720
of what you

2730
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:49,720
generate

2731
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:50,720
for content creators.

2732
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:51,720
Does that make sense?

2733
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:52,720
It's the only percentage

2734
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:54,720
base to the best they can.

2735
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:57,720
I've noticed my

2736
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:58,720
favorite troopers dabble

2737
01:55:58,720 --> 01:55:59,720
in theories.

2738
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:00,720
Must be one of those jokes

2739
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,720
from the universe.

2740
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:02,720
Honestly, the universe

2741
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:03,720
is a little funny joke for you.

2742
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:04,720
Like, please,

2743
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,720
if you're ever, like,

2744
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:07,720
thinking,

2745
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:08,720
oh, there's nothing

2746
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:09,720
interesting's gonna happen

2747
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:10,720
in my life,

2748
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:11,720
I assure you,

2749
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:12,720
the universe is cooking something.

2750
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:13,720
Because I,

2751
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:15,720
I am the biggest,

2752
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:16,720
like,

2753
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:17,720
don't support,

2754
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,720
like,

2755
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:19,720
pugs,

2756
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:20,720
don't support

2757
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:21,720
French Bulldogs,

2758
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:22,720
like,

2759
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:23,720
don't support

2760
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:24,720
munchkin cats,

2761
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:25,720
don't do this or that.

2762
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:26,720
And then the universe goes,

2763
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:27,720
oh, by the way,

2764
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:28,720
here's a half munchkin.

2765
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,720
I'm like,

2766
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:30,720
oh, okay,

2767
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,720
I see how it is.

2768
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:33,720
This squishy thing

2769
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:34,720
is kind of hypnotic.

2770
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:35,720
Yeah, you can, like,

2771
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,720
see the balls move around in it.

2772
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,720
It's just quite nice.

2773
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:39,720
I quite like it.

2774
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:45,720
It's, like,

2775
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:46,720
really therapeutic

2776
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,720
to, like,

2777
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,720
squish down into it,

2778
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:49,720
honestly.

2779
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,720
I'm not being,

2780
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:52,720
like, I genuinely

2781
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:53,720
wholeheartedly mean it.

2782
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:54,720
Like, it feels very nice

2783
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:55,720
to, like, squish something

2784
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:56,720
under my feet.

2785
01:56:58,720 --> 01:56:59,720
Got to go.

2786
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,720
Have fun with the rest

2787
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,720
of the game.

2788
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:02,720
Congratulations.

2789
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,720
Thank you.

2790
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,720
Yes, please don't worry.

2791
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:05,720
Can you go?

2792
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:06,720
I'm going to redirect

2793
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:07,720
into the sheebie.

2794
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:09,720
Actually,

2795
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:10,720
is she up right now?

2796
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:13,720
Hold on.

2797
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:14,720
I'm leaning over.

2798
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,720
She's live right now

2799
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,720
with another crab's treasure.

2800
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,720
Oh, yeah.

2801
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,720
Apparently,

2802
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,720
the music in that game

2803
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:25,720
is, like, so good.

2804
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:26,720
But it's a Dark Souls crab.

2805
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:27,720
I thought it was, like,

2806
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:28,720
a fun little crab game.

2807
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:29,720
I was going to play it

2808
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:30,720
and someone said it was, like,

2809
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:31,720
it's like Dark Souls

2810
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,720
and I'm like, bro,

2811
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,720
if I can't,

2812
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:34,720
if I can't tag in

2813
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:35,720
the reflins to help me,

2814
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:36,720
then that game,

2815
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:37,720
there's a fight.

2816
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,720
I will most likely do

2817
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:44,720
a Talking Stream membership

2818
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,720
one for next week,

2819
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:47,720
just because there's

2820
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:50,720
so many marshmallows

2821
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,720
I can't really say,

2822
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:53,720
but we can see

2823
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:54,720
in another time.

2824
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,720
But yeah,

2825
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,720
I hope you enjoy this

2826
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:00,720
role-play, role-play,

2827
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:01,720
it's not even role-play.

2828
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:02,720
Literally, it wasn't even

2829
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:03,720
ASMR.

2830
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:04,720
I'm talking to you

2831
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:05,720
at normal levels.

2832
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:06,720
I normally do it for streams,

2833
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,720
so it's all fake.

2834
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,720
It's a Souls crab game,

2835
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:14,720
honestly.

2836
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:15,720
Adjust the ears, boy.

2837
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,720
Thanks for the stream, Sonny.

2838
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:18,720
It's what's Sonny.

2839
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:19,720
Strawny.

2840
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:20,720
Thank you, not Alessandro,

2841
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:21,720
for the two.

2842
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:22,720
I appreciate it.

2843
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,720
I really hope

2844
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:24,720
I've managed to say

2845
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:25,720
everyone's names.

2846
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:26,720
Thank you so much

2847
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:27,720
for your patience as well

2848
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:28,720
as I completely messed

2849
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:29,720
that stream up

2850
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,720
and wholeheartedly

2851
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,720
just, like,

2852
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:33,720
yapping in tone.

2853
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:35,720
That's all we're doing here.

2854
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:38,720
Best stream I had

2855
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:39,720
feet and a kitty.

2856
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:40,720
What more could I ask for?

2857
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,720
Yeah, that was gimme.

2858
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:43,720
Love this.

2859
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:44,720
Thank you, Strawny.

2860
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,720
Thank you, my stream.

2861
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:46,720
Thank you so much, yes.

2862
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:47,720
I will go now,

2863
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:48,720
but thank you so much

2864
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:49,720
to everyone who

2865
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:51,720
membershiped

2866
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:52,720
and gifted

2867
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:54,720
and download, etc.

2868
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,720
The membership streams

2869
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:56,720
start next week

2870
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:57,720
because this week's schedule

2871
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:58,720
had already kind of been

2872
01:58:58,720 --> 01:58:59,720
locked in

2873
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:00,720
and I didn't actually know

2874
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:01,720
what I was going to do

2875
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:02,720
with the monetization.

2876
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,720
Thank you, Dufus.

2877
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,720
Dufedoff

2878
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:08,720
for the member.

2879
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:09,720
And again,

2880
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:10,720
if you can't membership,

2881
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,720
please do not worry.

2882
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:13,720
I always have

2883
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:14,720
free streams coming.

2884
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:15,720
I always have free content

2885
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,720
coming out.

2886
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:17,720
You just need to

2887
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,720
give me a little patience.

2888
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:19,720
But the dust

2889
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:20,720
is definitely starting

2890
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:23,720
to settle from debut,

2891
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:24,720
which means I can, like,

2892
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:25,720
fully focus on

2893
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:26,720
everything I want to do.

2894
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,720
Legs!

2895
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:28,720
Thank you for the five gifts.

2896
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:29,720
I appreciate it.

2897
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:30,720
Congrats on those

2898
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:31,720
who caught it

2899
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:32,720
with your face.

2900
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:33,720
And all the music.

2901
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:34,720
Thank you very much.

2902
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:35,720
That was very kind of you.

2903
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:36,720
But yes, the dust

2904
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:37,720
is starting to settle,

2905
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:38,720
which is good

2906
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:39,720
because it means

2907
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:40,720
I can start focusing

2908
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:41,720
on the free content

2909
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:42,720
I want to do

2910
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,720
and all the stuff

2911
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:44,720
I want to

2912
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,720
think about.

2913
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:46,720
But yes,

2914
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:47,720
please say hi to Shipee

2915
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,720
for me.

2916
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,720
I will type a few

2917
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:50,720
messages in her chat

2918
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:51,720
and then I am going

2919
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:52,720
to go soak

2920
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:53,720
this little tub

2921
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:54,720
and see what happens.

2922
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:55,720
Yeah,

2923
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:56,720
my purr tub

2924
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:57,720
isn't doing

2925
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,720
so good.

2926
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,720
But we'll see.

2927
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:00,720
We'll see.

2928
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:01,720
Okay.

2929
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:02,720
Right.

2930
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:03,720
Bye-bye for now,

2931
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,720
reeflings.

2932
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,720
I would do

2933
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:06,720
my little kissy,

2934
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:07,720
but this is the

2935
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:08,720
microphone.

2936
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:09,720
Can I kiss you

2937
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,720
with my tub?

2938
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:11,720
Right.

2939
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:12,720
This is

2940
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:13,720
my kisses.

2941
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:14,720
Mmm.

2942
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:15,720
Mmm.

2943
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:16,720
Mmm.

2944
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:17,720
Mmm.

2945
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,720
Mmm.

2946
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,720
Mmm.

2947
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:20,720
Mmm.

2948
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:21,720
Mmm.

2949
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:22,720
Mmm.

2950
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:23,720
Mmm.

2951
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,720
Bye-bye, reeflings.

2952
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:25,720
Bye-bye.

2953
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,720
Look,

2954
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:27,720
I'm waving you goodbye.

2955
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:28,720
Bye-bye.

2956
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,720
Oh,

2957
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,720
this is like really hard

2958
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,720
and like doing on an axis here.

2959
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:32,720
Bye-bye.

2960
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:33,720
Actually,

2961
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:34,720
I can shake this

2962
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:35,720
foot really fast.

2963
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:36,720
Bye-bye.

2964
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:37,720
Okay.

2965
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,720
Bye-bye, reeflings.

2966
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:39,720
I'm going to

2967
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:40,720
say hi to Shipee.

2968
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:41,720
Okay.

2969
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:42,720
Bye-bye.

2970
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:43,720
reeflings.

2971
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:44,720
Be good.

2972
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:45,720
Bye-bye.
