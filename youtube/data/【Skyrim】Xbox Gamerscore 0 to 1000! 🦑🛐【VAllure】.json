{"text": " Testing, testing. Attention, please. Attention, attention. Hear you, hear you. Skyrim belongs to the North. That's my hear you, hear you. Why are you saying I hate you? I'm not even freaking spawning yet! Let me spawn in! You know, I learned something new yesterday thanks to TikTok so I can't wait to talk about it. Right, testing. This is Ambroker. See, this freaking, you freaking freaks. Oh my god! Oh my god! I'm YouTube, I got accepted from YouTube monetization like right now! No way! I just got accepted for YouTube monetization right freaking now! No way! Wait, but I need to do my stream then! Wait! Oh my god! I literally just opened up YouTube studio! I've been accepted! No way! Wait, do I need to go off lane and do my... No, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh my god! We did it! What the frick? What's the frick? Fractally tech? Tic-tac? Petty work? Oh my god! Wait, and hopefully this doesn't say anything. Wow! Wow! I just freaking checked! Right, right. We're still gonna do Skyrim today because you know, Skyrim belongs to the Norths. But what? Tomorrow I'll get to do my monetization celebration stream! And my toes look amazing for it so I'm excited! Oh my god! That's amazing! Right, if you're freaking watching right now, don't worry. Like the how you call it. The memberships aren't like activated because I need to like go in and tell it like what to call the tiers and stuff. But I'm like 100% sure tier one is $1.99 USD. This is to prevent anyone gaining access via gift to membership streams. And then I believe the the membership price, like the actual price, is $4.99 USD. Does that sound right? I need to ask you guys! I need to ask you guys what sounds right. You guys call the shots. Yeah, if it's $4.99 and then Patreon's $5 then it's $9.99 total to support your Oshii at Veiler. You okay? That seems right. Okay, that sounds okay. Everyone's gonna give me the thumbs up. Ahhhh! Congrats on the monetization. Doesn't mean we won't support you in other ways anymore though. Oh, thank you so much. I really miss you. WAH! Congrats. I'm happy for you. Why are you giving me money for getting more money? What the fuck? It's an infinite money glitch. Oh my god. Also, there was an offline donation by Shank. Shank says, thank you for the tip, by the way, he says, I'm over here squiddin' my dick. I got ink on my dick right now. Which is so good. Thank you, Tim Schottel. Congrats on the monetization. Thank you! And Bajinga as well. Thank you again for the tip. For the 20. That was a big tip. Thank you. Okay. To prevent gifts, you need to set the membership quote above five bucks. Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wasn't it not membership can only be gifted? Stop giving me! He's confusing the couple things. Then why are you giving me money for being able to make, oh my god, no! I have to end up my ASMR series now. I have four ASMR videos. I owe you. Oh, and I'm doing an endurance stream today. It's over. Reluctantly saying thank you for the tip. Wait, I could have sworn you can only gift the lowest tier membership on YouTube, or has that been updated since? I won't say who so they can announce it themselves, but someone else has also gotten monetized. Oh my god, we're all done or monetized? No way. Like, okay. So the only reason we didn't like get monetized faster in quotation marks is because you, stop it! Don't give me money! Forget money! Pre-ordering my search. Thank you. Don't stay down for the tip. That's crazy. That's freaking crazy. Gifts go to the most expensive tier under five bucks. So I need to set it as 501. That looks terrible though. That looks so greedy. But I can't have any outsiders in the membership streams because I need to use a lot of euphemisms. Are you squiddling right now? Shank! Oh, it's off-link! I'm in front of the Blackwater. I'm all about stron of the bath. Thanks, Shank, for the tip. You guys will get the Blackwater reference very shortly. Super training, Virginia! Stop! Actually, one cent greed law. Actually, it's two cent greed because I wanted it 4.99. It's said it to... No, six dollars is too much. This is too much money to ask for, like, for membership stuff. Oh, right, that's it. When I said we're making an agency together, I wasn't kidding. Oh, I see. And our snowberries are here. They just did an ASMR stream. We all have to keep our voices down, okay? The snowberries are asleep. Fine, you've got it. Set it to 999. I would start at 60 bucks just to be sure. Post up, are you? And hi, Icy Raiders. Hi, snowberries. I just unlocked monetization. I didn't know until I freaking went on my channel. It just happened right now. I'm not going to do my monetization celebration today. I'm going to do it tomorrow and then it gives me a less time to do endurance skyrim unless we come back to maybe switch up the thingy. But that's okay. It's actually a perfect transition from Icy's stream. Hi, hi, little icicles. But yes, we are all getting monetized very slowly, which is fantastic. Oh my gosh, you can get support via email or chat. Don't worry, that chat support thing does absolutely nothing. I assure you, it doesn't do a single thing, okay? Actually, I tell a lie, they did help me one time, so I'll give it up. Amy, thank you, Amy, for your clap, clap, clap. Apparently, there's one other person that has been processed. When we applied, it was like, yeah, it takes a month for them to review your chat. A month, a month to review James Cameron's avatar, excuse me. A month to freaking review Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, excuse me. Oh no, I never, oh, you guys so much ASMR video. But I do have some good news about VTuber Collabs. I finally, I finally sent away. So now I'm waiting on the girls. The ball is now in the girls court that I'm collabing with. Yeah, yesterday, I was listening to a music creator called Yoast. He's a Dutch and he was in Eurovision and he goes, Welcome to Europe. Life is till the daughter, Europa, Europa. Turns out he has a song where it goes, Sakma. So just imagine me playing the song and repeat in the dark, taping up four ASMR collabs in one go. A month review time sounds realistic, given the fact that your streams are all above 10 hours. Thank you for the tip again, but you're giving a lot of money. You need to be careful with the crowd. Are you just reading me right now? You're in trouble too. No, thank you for the tip. Oh my God. Damn, I almost got that song out of my head. Yeah, so basically just imagine me in a dark room, just I had this song on repeat. I'm like, yeah, okay, right. Wolf mums, Pamper you to sleep, right? Okay, what's next? Okay, jealous VTubers drag you in an alleyway for tangos. Okay, what's next? What's next? Right, next script. Like I was on it. I was on it. Anonymous. It's the silent and on his back. He's giving money, but he's not saying anything. He's not getting Brian to say anything. Thank you for the tip. But yeah, anyway, that's how I work. I don't know how you work, but I work like a madman. Had to take a shower. So I've got to listen at 1.5 speed for the next 15 minutes. I was not prepared for the super speed beat up. So I was as strongly forgotten to live tweet or tweet. If you mean tweet, I have absolutely horrific news. I am the worst VTuber to ever spawn. I never use my emotes. I spent like so much on all these emotes. I never use them. I never tweet out when I'm live because I start at the same time every single day and I'm like, you want to be here, you're gonna be here. Somebody. Absolutely. Next script. YouTube to monetize you one day after you get proved. I mean, depending on how the monetization celebration goes tomorrow, that's quite plausible. But hey, at least a little bit YouTube history. Don't mind if I make the headlines for VLR. So you guys go and support my gen mates. That's right. There are five other lovely girls in the description below for you to check out. If you cannot stand, Todd winning yet again with the death grip the Skyrim has over female VTubers. Okay. So if you've had enough of that, Denny, you worry, I've got you sorted out. Sheepsters is going live and team minus two hours. I believe Emma and Azura, my goodness, Azura, and is coming for my Endurance Stream title. For goodness gravy, she was up on a farm. No, it's not called Farmville. The farming star Jew Valley, for goodness sake. And then she really popped out of 10 of her Endurance Stream. I'm like, damn, they're coming from my title. But I'm gonna show them how it's done. Okay, I'm gonna show them how it's done. I woke up feeling sick and I was like, oh, maybe I won't do an Endurance Stream. But the moment I hit go live, it feels like I have been given a second burst of energy, a second wind, if you will. It's like that cinematic moment in like the video game thing. We're like, oh, Brian. Why would you give 100? That's so much. You never even said anything, Dapper Bucket. Oh my God. Thank you for the 100. Iron Reaper 100. Why are you? Why are you giving me money for being able to earn more money? What's going on? What's going on? Have I missed something in the VTuber etiquette book? Iron Reaper, thank you for the 100. Dapper, thank you for the 100. Zarian, congrats on monetization. Meeting great for anyone who goes over $20 on the donut. That's terrible. You can't say that part out loud. Literally, everyone is giving your... Yeah, please make sure you are fully sorted before you give any money. Please understand, I adore what I do. I have been welcomed with open arms into the VTuber community as someone who could definitely have been described as an outsider. And instead of being shunned, I was welcomed and taught the ropes, which I'm so thankful for. But please understand, like, I get streamed for free. I love what I do, okay? Anonymous with a 20 with no message again. Brian, you look, you need to put Brian to work, okay? You need to put Brian to work. Oh, anonymous, give me 20 because I said the 20 thing. That is terrible. But we've done it. We officially have finished our first week at Bueller Headquarters. Literally, everyone has done fantastic streaming. I am very happy to see some of the girls taking a break. Oh, Irvan Biscay. Brian. We don't like giving YouTube a cut. Wait, oh, that's why you do stream elements. Okay, I understand. I read about that. Thank you, Irvan Biscay. Brian! Don't know, we'll continue until morale improves. Congratulations. Wait, why did I know that? Do you guys hear Brian at all when he talks? Yeah, you do, surely you do. Oh, my God. Wait, you said I said your name yesterday correctly. Rilke? Rilke? Cadmus? Thank you for the tip. Why did I know that quote? Yeah, we hear him. Okay, thank God. God, it feels like so much longer. You've always been here. I think because, like, my average streamed week is probably what a VTuber achieves in an entire month. So it feels like I've been here for a very long time. I was like, nope, this is officially my first, like, strum, you know, first second week of streaming. Ancient joke, the beatings will continue until the more... Okay, that's... Okay, okay, okay. Guys, do you know a perfect way to party the achievement? A really big storm of bad joke. What did you even say? Was that supposed to be a joke? I don't get it. I don't get the joke if that was supposed to be a joke. So you're getting crickets. Who's ready? Who's ready for bi-zura, bi-zura, bi-zura. Now, I know that's not in this game, but bi-zura. Remember that time I accident... Wait, can you hear the game? Can you hear any of that?

Yeah, if you want a shield then There is one here, but I don't really bother a shield that I do two-handed So we're gonna get a war hammer very shortly There should be coins down here and one of these if I'm not mistaken I guess 300 no 300 coins seems a bit extreme. Maybe 30 coins in there. We are just gonna blast through it Um Try two-handing mage mage is my fave. No two-handed warrior two-handed Lightweight warrior and you can muck around with a bow and arrow Like if you do the nightingale quest you get light armor. That's pretty sneaky But the thief skilled armor especially for the stamina and like item increase is so good and as for how we're gonna tackle what we do first I'm going to purposefully do the companions quest line and then load a previous save Because I don't like oh, sorry. Sorry. Hold on. I was out of stamina. I was trying to reach up and that oh I see just posted a very watery tweet. No way the the piss corp Accusations we ain't beating them today and we ain't beating them tomorrow The nightingales. Yeah pure mage is hard mode. I There should be something up here if I remember correctly on the right side of these rocks What was it? Oh, it's just a weak coin purse I got 14 gold. Honestly purse scaly boy. He's he's gone. He he couldn't get out, but the bars are broken now. I Love the jewel wheels nightingale peeler. No, no peeler That's awful, but that's hilarious at the same time Right, there are spiders so if any of you are arachnophobic whoa Don't worry They are getting absolutely. Yeah, I've been poisoned. I think they give stamina for space But yeah, please look away if you're arachnophobic. We are just gonna blast through this area Did I come from here? I think there's something to look up there. Maybe I don't know I can't There is a bear ahead. I say look away, but you're too busy doing something on your alternative Twitter, so it's okay She doesn't have to know We are gonna take this for some really quick money I believe there is an achievement for holding 100,000 gold at one stage the best way to make gold I have found is by enchanting and selling that jewelry and There is a bit of a mild strut that I devised myself. I don't know if it's the strut Survival mode survival adds the need absolutely not. What is this? Survival adds the need to eat sleep and stay warm also adds challenges such as no no and no I want vanilla Skyrim. Oh my god. Is that is that PC? I Just really am I not am I not getting achievements on Xbox for this? I don't think I am I'm not I named the stream zero to 1,000. Well, that's a very accurate over them Are you playing anniversary? In additional challenge. Oh, well, we should have gone achievement there, but we're not playing Xbox. I'm dumb Imagine having to eat each 10 cheese wheels. Um, so there is a really easy mine You can clear out. I think it will give us two handed. Um, that's just there to head It's like right in your oh, actually. Sorry the standard stones first standing stones. I believe there are 12 standing stones which give you a Certain boosts such as a faster leveling XP under certain things. So there's a mage stone There's a thief stone and there is a warrior stone, but there's different ones as well one I believe is like a mule stone where you just straight up can carry more items on your persons Yeah, literally activate thief activate mage activate warrior. We are gonna do thief Are we gonna do thief what's warrior I've forgotten Right, we'll do warrior normally I do thief but we will we're gonna clear out this mine very quickly We're just gonna pick up ingredients as we go along the way of the stones the way work. Yeah, there should be achievement to find them all. Yes Well So that just not have achievements at all because I'm not I'm playing on Xbox game pass, but it's not like instance to Xbox Don't be too afraid of the wolves on the They are to hit they can give you rock joint. Oh, I've gone past the mine already They can give you Is it no, it's a rock joint or is it lockjaw? I Think it's rock joint. Oh My memory of me I've gone so past this mine shaft. Yeah, here we go. Right. There should be a bad day out here. Hello Yeah, yeah, yeah You're playing a novice. No, no, these accusations are unfound. It is rock. I thought that but strong eight Where is the Blarney and yes, I know the Blarney stone. What? Are you trying to make a ballamore joke? There's a trip wire here in this mine, but don't worry about it As I said, you can please get him up whatever level you want. I like blasting through and just absolutely annihilate and take this Like it's so good. There are some later stages were even been on easy mode. Isn't that bad? Although I have to admit. I guess this is registering as PC Skyrim and It's quite different. Oh, this is so sad. They made this person mine themselves to death They've had me working down here for days now. It's not the time that's getting to me though. It's these tunnels I've told this countless times now to add extra support to the weak sections of the tunnel If only we had more of these wooden beams that were we reinforced with bronze bottoms Honestly, if I hear the earth shift one more time above my head, I'm so stressed. I may stop drinking for good I mean, what's a Nord without his mead and he died because of a collapse in So my granddad was a miner and he used to tell me really rough stories about Um The he is like being in the mineshaft and all of that and they had a mine collapse and Within two minutes. They had already killed the guy out and he was gone like he Parish it was great. I may a minor. Yes and They do I think bandits normally have like a lockpick and coin, but it's not really the best and You can't just like straight up grab this shit, but there is a big chest in here So we're just gonna clear out the way unless we oh, I was gonna say unless we speak but the guy's right there And yeah, but like my granddad used to talk so openly about the We just got it just like Callers. Oh, no, hold on. Everyone knows I'm bad at log-picking now Um, okay, we've got our first. What are you 20 damage rate 20 damage? He like spoke so openly about it and I'm like Granddad Granddad, that's just straight up like stuff. That's like man-made like horrors beyond comprend comprehension type stuff this chest Okay, we're definitely on PC cuz amber does Not look like that. What the heck? What the heck? I've never seen that in Skyrim before am I going crazy or I don't know Right don't get ready to swing Oh Oh And if the book is valued at 50 coins or more You will level up reading that book if you are ever in a section and you're like what the heck are all these books if that book is valued at 50 Septim or more then it is actually a skill book. Oh Oh my god, that's so satisfying That's so freaking satisfying Hold on a minute. Yeah, that's a yeah, bone archer Um, I think there's a tiny little chest on the edge here. I think there's a little bug with a difficulty No, not at all. I'm playing on. Oh wait. It's just an a vein If you didn't know and these are called veins when you can see the ore sticking out from the wall It's quite interesting. Honestly, maybe I should talk about mining because my granddad spoke to me in big detail about it and Like how they used to come out and like their eyes really bloodshot red and everything and have I missed that chest back there? I think I have but it's not a big deal Yeah, I thought that and I just like I was like I've missed that chest having a bit fine If you run where your weapon out your stamina will decrease, but that's okay. You don't really need it Especially when you're just so good at the game like playing legendary mode like as I'm playing right now If you didn't know I'm playing legendary mode like just because I'm such a pro everything becomes really easy And you just have to like understand the strats as long as you like swing first Basically, you win every fight and the reason why they hardly do any damage to me is Because I have such high defense, of course and not any other reason If you're looking for work, go see pot at the main rail off said you could help me Reload you know him He's a friend. He promised you could help we escaped from the amperials together did We heard that all free cause she lied as easily should breathe. What are you talking about?

Should we read his journal? Left trigger read My fingers are trembling the golden claws finally in my hands and with it the power of the ancient nordic heroes that Fool lucian valerius has no idea that his favorite store decoration was actually the key to bleak falls Tharu now I just need to get to the hall of stories and unlock the door the legends say There is a test that the nord's put in place to keep the unworthy way But that when you have the golden claw the solution is in the palm of your hand Oh, shit. Okay. I saw that coming. I'm so sorry. I saw that coming. I stood right on that trap Oh, shit. Why when I use a stamina move Stop holding the freaking stamina bar. Holy crap. When I do a stamina move it like makes me go to the side Literally the only thing that's going to hurt me in this game is um Is uh traps nothing else Spider girl for gen two Hmm So there's one I don't want to talk about it too much just for my baby girls like We are only a weekend. Wait, is there a drogger here? I'm a little crazy. No, um Obviously, I don't want to disrespect the baby girls. Um, I was talking to them about like how development works behind the scenes um And unfortunately, I used my words pretty poorly and it made some of them a bit uncomfortable So I don't really like talking about it too much. Um, but it's due to my poor communication It's not due to the the girls in any way um But I what I can say is that development takes a year at least for uh generation Like an entire generation if you will um And like I I don't want to say too much to make the girls feel like oh I'm just like casting them aside because like oh shiny gen two like no, that's absolutely not the case like I have said this from the start. Um if there is going to be a gen two It will be at least a year away like I am I am not rushing gens out just for the sake of doing it. That's that's so unbelievably disrespectful To the girls who have placed faith in me um, and Like I still have a load of plans like now that the girls are in the stage of being monetized. Um There's a lot of plans we can now execute. Um, like shorts as well. There's a lot of shorts that need to be made. Um, we have a fantastic shorts editor who did a Hail Mary to the website and applied themselves Um, and he's he's been a fantastic shorts editor He's pretty much done the majority of the work. We have a a second one Who's quite busy at the moment, but we are gonna, you know, test if it's all good and if it's all good then You know, we've got a lot of shorts play coming up. Um confirmed not a black company. I I hope not I I said to the girls wholeheartedly and hopefully they will voucher. They remember I said something along the lines I oh, I wasn't paying attention. Sorry. Um, I said if I ever do anything to you that is Like absolutely hurting you that hurts you in any way that is a completely negative experience with me in any way Take me out back and shoot me. Um, like it was it's why I was very serious in the interview Uh, they they are welcome to talk about the interview if they would like, um, am I going the wrong way? Am I going back the way I came? No, I'm not. Um I said to them Do not ever refer to me as your boss. Do not ever think of me as like a superior or something like that Um, that's definitely not Ever how I want you to think like I am literally like in this with you. We're we're memeing about we're figuring out what we want to do like, um Definitely take me out back and shoot me. I'm so serious. Do not ever ever let me like oh, that's It does more damage. Um, like do not ever take me like You know, what's that saying you live long enough to become the villain Don't ever let me live become don't ever let me live long enough to become the villain Take me out back and shoot me like oh It's why from the get go like if the girls sign on their contract for another year. Uh, we the company um We offer an alternative outfit on the house for them as well as their pay increase goes Sorry, I'm fucking try to like remember the the attack pattern and where the droggers spawn in this we'll talk about this but um Like uh, we definitely wanted to raise their income and the split goes 85 15 again kind of showing that we're not really here for grade. We're kind of here for alternative reasons. Um So is there an actual see oh, I don't own the company Like I genuinely wholeheartedly my my my name I'm Basically my role is what is a creative director. I already if you look on the Thingy it'll tell you what the code is but you just need to move these twice and then you've got the correct code Unless it's different on pc. Uh, but basically I'm I was the creative director because I did used to have the scripts like I used to be the script maker I no longer have that there's no a manager. All I do right now is stream as strone as me Um, and I send away shorts like I literally went into the girls dms Last night like after streams And I was like, hey, um, can I get an audio of you saying this and they're like, yeah, I'll do it in the morning Like that's that's all I do Uh, you're a cco. I don't know what a cco is. You're already like the opposite of a black company Ah I mean you're ready to be dragonborn Word of power learn force unrelenting force force um, there's always an overlord or um some sort of um Protector of the words of power, which you know makes sense all things considered Uh, oh, we're gonna break that down Chief creative officer, um Nah, I've uh, we're just gonna break everything down and I think there's a hidden chest by this waterfall Although I could be completely wrong. Oh, well, no Damn my memory coming through it's been how many years since I played this game and I'm like, yeah There's a wee hidden chest here. Then there's this there and then you can pick this up and then I do that Oh my god. So mlg pro honestly, um Wow you a Cuted that based on honestly force sounds like the german word foo, which means food Oh, did you like my foos last night? Huh? Did did you like them streams? Tell me I don't have I feel so feminine right now I'm like the most feminine I might get more pedicures because honestly that that that was so fun. I enjoyed it The woman was so like both the women were so lovely. I felt so flustered in that stream though I hope it didn't come across too badly But I was like so out of my element like when I saw the time was an hour until A sheepsters was up. I was like, oh my god. What have I done? Like, how did I speedrun it? It's like so quickly Have you got back the tool? Um, it's still unfortunately very Cut up. So I've still got a wee bandaid on it. I washed it in the bath Uh, she got me good. All I'm gonna say is she got me good. Like it was deep You know, like the side the smaller side part of your tool cuts straight into that She was really sorry though, but it's fine like stuff happens honestly And I believe she was new I believe she was new to the establishment. So it's better to It's better for her to make a mistake on me because like hopefully I'm nice and understanding And they're like, I wouldn't say anything mean. I was like, oh, you're fine. Like don't worry about it Um, and like the other women was like translating for her because she didn't speak English And I was like, it's fine. So I'm kind of glad she made that mistake on me Rather than someone else who would have been like a Karen basically like I'm not gonna say anything about Australia, but um I have I have heard some unique Conversations occur. I'm not even paying attention to the plot because I'm too busy rambling about my my life. Um Look forward to the seat stream. Anyway Who slashed your toe the lady that was doing my pedicure? Uh, oh god, I'm not like paying attention to the plot. Oh, right. We've just handed over the dragon stone He's gonna translate it or something and then they're gonna know that's uh The things are back. Uh, this is a map of Skyrim. It's very big. We're in white run right now Um, we're actually gonna take a horse and carriage and go to rift in because I want to do the thieves guild quest. Yippee It's my favorite quest um But yes, so that's the Skyrim town that's the sky. Hey, sorry, that's an uh Stormcork town stormcork Is winterhold stormcork? Solitude is the medium at the legion.

I don't feel it like I can feel tired like I can be like, oh, I need to go get some like tea and some food And then we'll play like for a couple of more hours. I can do that. No problem. Like at all I think the only time I feel I just feel frustrated that I don't have more time Like when I was doing all the ASMR collabs like writing all the scripts back to back Um, actually I knew girl, uh, I reached out to a new girl and I was like, hey, you want to do ASMR And she was like, I want to do some more and she's like, I know a lot about you and I was like, oh, that's embarrassing Um, but if you know a lot about me, then you know how easy this collab is gonna be because I'll do all the work Um, but like I don't mind doing all the work if anyone's lurking. Uh, I don't mind doing the work. I actually prefer it Um, because it makes things a lot easier And make every arrow count I used to not experience burnout playing games, but now I do which is a shame No, so if you can't play video games, that's like life burnout Like if you would rather watch someone else play video games than like play it yourself Live streaming doesn't count because you're you're being tortured to watch me play Skyrim via My controller where the heck is this dragon? Is he on the floor? Oh, it is Okay Oh, let's spank his butt Ah Whoa, it's actually kind of hurt me a little bit. No, you're stinking. You're so stinking Um See they've been on top.

Yarl has appointed me to be your house. Follow me. I need you. Oh my god. Wait. If I got Lydia's face Am I going crazy or do I have Lydia's face? Wait a minute. Did I accidentally recreate Lydia? Wait, take take that helmet off right now I think I may have accidentally recreated Lydia. Oh No I'm I'm such a Lydia fan boy.

I'm just such a I must have like subconsciously made her This that shoutings making people nervous on it till winning Lydia cuttles for real for real Right. We now need to go all the way up this mount. Well, we need to go to Rorik's stead I versus it. Oh my god. I'm such a fake gamer. Honestly. I don't even know why you guys listen to me half the time Uh, Tony's copied my whole flow word for word bar for bar. It's a highland coup Excuse me little gait. Let me just close that Let me just close that. Oh, it's the wee highland coup. Look at this. No, uh, whoa. Whoa Look at your wee horns Fun, uh, I mentioned this other day actually, uh, I had a relative that owned one and uh, the the they're actually super gentle Uh, but it made my relative blind in one eye lamal Because the horn poked his eyeball. Um, that was funny Uh, but it wasn't even mad at her It was a female highland coup. I can't even remember what he named there, but honestly, it sounds like the most scottish No, I don't care about your question. Shut the fuck up. Um, literally I honestly must sound so scottish to stream like oh, I have my granddad. Uh used to work in the mines Had a family that family member that literally owned a highland coup. Like oh my god I swear like me wonder I was raised in a bar and literally don't have manners. Like I just I never had it from the start A wee coup, a wee highland coup. My favorite part of a strong stream is our unofficial catchphrase. Did you know? Oh, did you know? Did you know? Uh, right, I think we're gonna manually walk there. There are gonna be wolves ahead But because we're playing legendary differently and I'm such an MLG pro at this game. Um It's honestly not problem and we might even see Cicero on the way It's unlikely we'll meet Cicero on the way there just because he spawns I find the Cicero spawns more northern west of the map and we are currently going southern east, which is the opposite Um Lydia No, hello. This war is as stupid as our feud with clan gray may need something. No Oh, oh, she's got a bit of them. Oh, what was that shadow freaking the honeybearing meadery. Uh, yes a bit of a bit of meadery Oh, wait, will we open a veal or a meadery? Why not? that seems to be the way of like um Content creators when they get in their endgame they like come out with a product. I'm like I think my endgame would be video games like Like paying to get them made like what what my my rubbish ideas are Um, I think that's probably my endgame. Whoa, okay That was that was a lot going on the screen for one for one. So That was quite a lot. There is a waystone up ahead. I don't think it's a good one Haggis and Neeps and ties Do you also live in a lone tower up on some hill? Are you? Wait, oh, no, is this an enemy dog? No, it's a nice dog. Hello. I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years Are you telling me my lore story is shrek right now? You can buy dragon scale. You've not got the money for it our Wah, wah, wah The other drinks it may or may not contain something Unique to the girl. I see that skeever on the road. Don't think I can't see you. We are Oh, so captured that that is the noise. I like to hear honestly Uh, I believe there's a few skeletons up on this hill, but Again, nothing we can't handle Nothing we can't handle at all Um, as I said, we're gonna do the main quest. We're gonna do the thieves Um, and then hello, are you you are definitely an enemy? Oh I do beg your pardon, but it's all the way absolutely nothing around these parts And another soul capture do you have soul gem? Spark white cap will destroy those. Oh Oh Oh, how dare you Do you? Oh, wait, I think that ancient that ancient bow is stronger than what we have for our bow. Um Right root skeletons scared. Oh scary Are you squiddling me right by the pope? I don't like my family history every time I read my family history I always have to ask myself. Are we the bad guys? Monka is Thank you for the tip Are we the bad news I think my family history is like really boring It's just like, yeah Scottish and Irish I know that you can do like 23 and me tests to like really see where you come from But I actually don't uh, I don't Believe it's safe at all to like willingly hand over your dna like that Look, I know I'm starting to send like needy streamer overload where we were doing like that god speed run Where she you know, she got into like all the conspiracy theories and stuff, but it's not really a conspiracy thing I like maybe I should do a stream like that on ironically I'll like yeah. Um, wait, what are you attacking? You're not attacking me. Oh, you're not. Okay, that's strange Uh, this gaily sounded like an oblivion scaly At least you got a cool accent out of the deal. Yeah Um, we are just running our way over to mvark said I believe is the town name award you kind of forgot the annunciation Um No, I don't think it's safe either to have your dna on fail of a company. Yeah, like um I took like ethics class um and we were Discussing like how good like emergent technology is like if you haven't heard about crisper is dna fixing technology Essentially dna fixing. Um, it's going through a lot of lab studies and trials and all that but it's found very effective against like, um You know things that were previously incurable essentially or diseases that are untreatable that kind of thing um and The technology that can be raised from it Um to help people is outstanding. However, do we Do we trust such? Do we trust your dna sequence to be handled with care or would in theory Insurance help. I'm sorry. I'm literally hell. Yeah. I'm up for scotland conspiracy theory stream Thank you so much. Totally not big anger. Um, like I I could definitely get into it, but we were like talking about like Uh, didn't see one of the interest your companies get caught selling all the data. They said they wouldn't is that yes uh, not to mention, um There's like a whole rabbit hole about what data leaks are. Um, because um I don't know. I don't know if you guys care, but um, there's actually a whole other conspiracy Um, that data leaks aren't actually like that. It's kind of more like government demands Uh to have access, but they already kind of have access to a lot of things Especially with the technology in the state age But uh, maybe I shouldn't go too far down the rabbit hole. Don't want to deter anyone. Where the heck am I supposed to go? I think there's a path ahead. I'll just follow this path. Um, I thought we were going down the designer baby route. Oh, well that already happened One of the biggest examples of the designer baby route was victoria beckham's children You're telling me that brown-eyed lady has a 25 percent of uh, blue-eyed offspring And she just happened to pop out two blue-eyed children. Uh, no She did what is called ivf and then the dna tested and checked if the children And in the egg in the egg. Yes in the egg Uh, we're able to uh had the recessive blue eyes Is already being done in this day and age and that was back in 2005 or something crazy. It's one of the biggest public Things that are right in the faces of people that you wouldn't know about it's already occurring today This also occurs with the fox p12 gene. I believe I'm so sorry if no one cares about this But I'll try and get through it really quickly. There's also a gene that's been identified called the fox p12 I believe Um, and if you have it it means you're actually a lot smarter and able to pick up things a lot easier than someone who is Without this gene and uh, it's been called into question that ivf babies may also be getting tested for this So you have a child or offspring that may be a bit smarter than the average But that's just on me. Okay, uh, I'll just leave it Leave it there, but there there's a lot. There's a lot Okay um It's really interesting to continue the happen. Yes So a lot of people think it hasn't already occurred or the first human hasn't been cloned and dolly the first sheep was cloned in 1964 I believe uh the no no no no no That's when we first were publicly allowed to be learned and to be taught about the cloning Um, it's already happened long ago You just don't get to know about it because ethnically it's messed ethnically Ethically it's messed up and the public shouldn't really be allowed to access this knowledge because well it brings up a lot of questions Such as if you call in a person Do they have one soul? Do they share a soul and then it brings religion into question If you didn't know religion also helps bring in a lot of order into people's and communities lives And the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep But we can't touch on that subject too much because i'm just a vtuber playing skyrim right now And we're just trying to get to every head so we can talk to the graybeards to learn about our true power as the dragonborn As we play this game So yes, please don't mind me Oh, this is a saber cat after me. My goodness um But yes, uh, please Please let us enjoy skyrim for what it is. Anyway, that's why I don't really start talking about these subjects because uh Yeah, it's uh It's a bit scary. It's a bit scary when you look into it. Yeah, right? Uh, yeah Gamers for genetically engineered cat girls represent absolutely I'm 100% there with you the fact that nickel girls aren't real. I used to right. This sounds really bad I used to actually fantasize about owning a nickel girl. I don't know why I just I used to fantasize about like treating her really well And like she would have had a previous owner before me or something, but i'll treat you right baby I don't know why I gave me like some sort of like superior like saving complex or something I don't know why but like I just oh I used to fantasize about all of that Like especially after watching monster monster mom Um, I used to like really Uh, there should be a quest where you deliver something for someone Is it you? Get an axe and bring me all the wood you can chop. Oh, okay, right. Sorry, jeez Um If this dream doesn't demonstrate that the tism is strong and veal or literally to the box There's someone that gives you a quest Okay, we're gonna yet if you talk to this guy you can do a quest for him Um There's also a hidden Thing If you read all of these on the way up something happens But I've completely forgotten what happens because I've never done it before because I saw it in a video And I've forgotten what happened in the video Uh, right, let's see emblem one before the birth of men the dragons ruled all of Mondus their words Their word was the voice and they spoke only for true needs For the voice could blot out the sky and flood the land Well four years means more years to tease Honestly what necopara does to mf for me honestly Damn strongy the last 10 minutes rumbles deaf and I'm so sorry Thank you.

Everyone wants to talk to you Right, uh, how could you possibly know that that I'm a thief the way they want Right, I'm going to tell you something you should absolutely not do Maybe you'd like a taste the game is going to ask you to plan a ring on this person And it locks him up in jail and removes Um, a cellar from rifting don't do it Don't do it. Okay If you do it, it removes him as a cellar and it's like another 800 coins You can't get from selling stuff these symbols you see around the city.

though you don't have to ask me toys wow all right bill of sale all done nice return to bring your feet all done the fact you went back to crack the joke I know they're enemies I think there's enemies open Skyrim oh okay it was just like a little detour if you will it will fast travel no we can't because there's enemies nearby whomp whomp it's just there'll be like a fish in the war that will also prevent me from going how about no why no boom wait what did I make why would I be doomed a dead corpse that's like being a dead corpse like a horse get it okay well you put me on the spot okay you put me on the spot I couldn't do it that fast good job last let me take a look at what you thought aren't got so golden glow he has no idea the extent if only the parchment had the buyers hmm but for now you're off to speak to me even black riot she asked for you by name it's just business that's but right we're just basically gonna speak to the person who is hand-in-hand with the thieves girl and she oh also if you ever need arrows for free literally it genuinely spawns in like a very good golf clap tomato tomato tomato boo stop doing that rub we will take a pee break very shortly because her bladders will be bursting for those of you who actually do hydrate for those of us who forget to hydrate you're just feeling a little bit tired because we need some food in the system good for the boys bad for the joy where she's upstairs what's your problem yeah what's your problem hello maven bright where is that confidence I hear is that aren't against strange I'm often that confused yeah yeah yeah yeah right she's gonna tell us to go do a quest where we manipulate and a competitor to her brewery and which is quite a unique one because of what goes on inside the quest quick question is our way to get into the these girl treasury not that I know of and other than doing the quest line where it opens up and then it reveals and then it were the big root wait what oh it's been reefing seed for honestly should I call a break should we do it wait hold on me let me finish my war oh that was top water yeah I don't really find a top war yeah when I have it in tea I guess it covers up all the flavor I work with my mother to sell first time vegetable that anyone are you okay I know it's scary I know it's scary to go into a new place for the first time but you'll be all right hand the new buddy oh my gosh I love it I love this game so much I'm a hello hello hello can't a man drink in peace geez you looks his eyes are gone like I shadow on I'm gonna keep this owner so we're to basically poison the bat from a meadery in order to get this guy arrested it's pretty pretty yeah it's pretty deep plot I have to admit the plot is so deep like it's probably I'd say an average of five inches deep of this plot and I will make a tea and get some food in me because I think I'm starting to go slightly delirious because I've not had anything I'm supposed to be holding a tasting at the new hunting so if he sees the meadery in this state there's currently skevers and at his meteorite and we're gonna offer well that's not how I operate you better or I'll yell skeever okay okay no need to make rash decisions here's half my only demand is that these are permanent so he is literally handing us the poison that we're gonna poison the bat of mead with it's it's it's so evil I love it please eat get that nutrition you I just get so distracted when I stream like I don't oh fucking hell um I just uh oh sorry sorry um it's all about pear shaped hasn't it uh yeah I just like kind of forget to eat and stuff when I stream I just get so distracted because it's like such a good time I've always been like oh my gosh oh all right oh this is things beating me up I'm literally like I'm on the red oh you can't even see my health bar oh wow my health bar is really bad right now uh I'll show you how bad it is I can I can heal right now that's how bad it oh maybe I need to adjust my chat so it doesn't go over the screen especially for video games like this I might get that change uh speaking the honeybrew mead with emmy needs honestly emmy needs delightfully emmy would cry for him it's not bad you're no hit legendary um hold on Lydia you Lydia Lydia you literally went around the way what do you mean by over the screen so you see how like next to me is that little cuttlefish to my to your left I guess from your paw see how the chat is like going up on screen from that chat box I might change it so it doesn't so the video game isn't like encroached in any way because I just noticed now that you can't see my health bar um you can see my stamina constantly but my big hairs oh oh sorry there's traps sorry sorry oh sorry sorry oh oh Lydia Lydia there's traps like did you not just hear me jump over them Lydia oh right this fight always scares me because this guy is actually super OP for no reason there's a man in here oh we need to we need to get him first because I have like no magic oh bruv bruv hold on all right I'll get the rats first he is like so strong for no reason and he freaking does that where he fucking backs off I hate when you back off when you're fighting them like I know that's normal to back off when someone's like coming at you but like it's so annoying just stand still and let me parachute it's like not that big a deal yeah so that man was currently living with the the skevers um you know as long as he's happy and thriving that's the main thing but no a little to the right no no a little to the left a bit more no a little bit more to the left he's a mage yeah we hate mages honestly there's so annoying male version of imme oh I mean ow I keep getting wrecked by these traps like I've like forgotten them all right we'll finish this quest and then I will get some food in me because I'm probably moments from perishing uh you can just grab this key back here by the way super easy um I totally didn't know that on my first playthrough and walked all the way back uh like a dumb dumb I don't want to steal from it it's honestly kind of picking up stolen items is really annoying if the guards end up picking you up right we've done it we've done the quest once we finish we'll take a look if you need to sample some of the finest meat in skyline that your shift hasn't even started yet when I'm hello well it's about time I you'll just have to wait until after the camp right we're gonna watch it all we're gonna watch it all in furl lydia go take a seat there lydia go sit lydia sit what do you need go sit okay got it well sir yarn now that you've taken care of your I said go sit how about I get a taste of you're ruining the view lydia even though you look just like me it's my finest room yet I call it the hate game from 2011 are you planning on playing the elton ring dlc yeah we you word when it comes out we're replaying the full game again and the dlc on top I have no idea how big the dlc is it's probably gonna be a week of elton ring so I do apologize to anyone who hates elton ring I will probably have like a shorter stream and maybe do like a membership stream as well and switch it up maybe she doesn't like to be told sit she's not a good girl bad girl actually well I'm here can we maybe just turn the music down a tiny bit yeah it's a bit overwhelming like in fates and stuff this is not what it seems butt bouncing are we actually doing butt bouncing I don't know have you done it I feel like I want to like race to get us to do the dlc I don't I assume you get the dlc once you've finished the game slamming away through the lines in between we'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's presence now move look I assure you this is all just a huge misunderstanding I said move he's got the big guns oh oh dear what is it now we have a tasting to attend to nothing you're supposed to go with him bad girls are incredibly good girls are the future I don't think that could have gone any better he always reminded me of Loki uh I need to get a look at sabjorn's books so maven wants you're welcome to take them here this should help thank you remember to put in a good word for maven for me any good boys for maven and then you then you all go boo and then I say any good boys for stroney and you'll go yeah and rejoice right we you won't get away with that is he gonna attack me you won't get away with that I'm sorry I can't believe that worked what am I not being as high that was so scary I accidentally picked up the bowl I would kill the boy for stroney you are his bestest refling all right we're going we're going back to handing the quest and then we're gonna take a pause break I'm gonna make a tea and get lots of food um and then we'll rant and rave about any and all topics actually I should check out marshmallows I've been getting sent some uh stuff uh live reveal and I'm just I'm that is a meme that is a meme I trust you have good jobs finished here's the info the only thing that could identify well you should bring this in there's also the matter of your payment yeah yeah yeah what does she give me oh she gave me an iron sword of embers I can destroy that I'll be a good boy for stroney oopsie picks a bowl stop right there criminal scum honestly this game is so sensitive like honestly I fell back right hand in this freaking quest and then I will go eat I am starving my body is literally doing the rumble jumble and I'm feeling I'm feeling weaker oh help me refling help me I'm so weak oh you're just gonna have to spin feed me uh you just need to look after me I'm a delicate little flutter okay hello hello word on the street is that poor sabbjorn has found as you wish I won't peak I won't ruin it what you're giving me to eat okay uh someone's trying to take the thief's guilt down and it's not us complete down why did the color palette just shift there I just I blink and you'll miss it honestly here comes airplane I found the same marking at the honey broom eatery you admire just don't mistake me because how can we make them pay golem I'm betting get out there shake him down shake him down whoo-hoo shake them no no no no no uh I need to talk to brine off again hi brine off I can't believe gullum eyes mixed up in all gullum eye not to be confused with golem a don't get me wrong you could scam a beggar how about I recite the work even more I reduce the work even more and chew it for me do you know that's how um used to food babies back in the day um it's actually really common for the moms to chew the food and then give it to the um um yeah so like before baby formula was a thing and like solid food training or whatever like before the kind of capitalism market kind of exploded went until you hear about what nesli did um yeah it was like really common your mom chews the food for you and then gives it to you in your mouth it's like a little baby birth moment and everyone's like that's so gross and I was like bro that's the way it is that's just like how have it be you know it's very interesting I actually could probably write an entire video I see about it and then present that video I say live on stream and just to show everyone how natural things are but everything's been so like oh they're so weird but it's only weird because we've not been exposed to it and we no longer even talk about it because it's like literally unironically been bred out of us over a few generations because capitalism is away um what one fun world scrawny did you consider getting mana as backup food yeah mummy burden literally I didn't know that was a thing it is so um uh babies newborns should start on breast milk because it's full of colostrum um and it's also because a baby doesn't actually have an immune system until six months old um so it's very important to have breast milk however it was very common to have what's called a wet nurse which is when um a woman who had recently had a child would share and because it's very common for some women to experience a surplus and it's very common for some women to experience problems producing milk it's just kind of random doesn't really there's a lot of factors that come into play um obviously stress is a major one stress on any human body for a long period do you mind I'm telling you a story about titty milk leave me alone um but yes I'm sure as a lot of you can imagine being stressed for a very long time is very bad for your health um guys uh guys uh stress manifests in a lot of mental health issues and a lot of loneliness um oh are we gonna make it you know what we're gonna send it send it right hold on hold on let them fake them out a little fake them out fake them out fake them out it's fine wow wait wrong one oh shit I'm out of stamina and he's like right next to me this is rather embarrassing I have to admit uh I didn't really think this far through yeah stress got me pretty good yeah I like it here because I learned so much information okay there we go we can get away we're I hear it I don't see it I think that's good that I don't see it though because it means it's not near me don't call me out like that yeah it's very um interest in the way it physically manifests in the way like obviously I think the majority of us have been like raised in a western society which obviously comes with a lot of socialization and socialization plays so much into the how you can deal with stress factors and like it's just kind of a sad fact that like homeboys uh kind of get told to suck it up um like I can literally go green to the girls right now and it's like nothing's wrong with it or anything um but it's very interesting how you tackle it I don't even know how you tackle it I wouldn't even have a clue where you start like the only thing I guess you could hope for is pockets of communities and overtime ideas get popular like um when the general consensus of society changes that's when the real change comes through but the problem is you have to basically go out with the old and how do you go out with the old well the old passes away the old doesn't bring down bring down the old doesn't pass on its teachings like for example um I like my grandparents talked about how they got hit by their parents and it was very common place to be hit if you didn't know it's actually illegal to punish your child via a corporal punishment yes your own child in Scotland is legal and you will be prosecuted for hitting them no it is not punishment no it is not spanking no it is literally against the law you're welcome to go up and it's very bad for the child there's a lot of things done around it um but it's very fascinating um how quickly things can change within a generation so my grandparents told me stories about them getting hit by their parents they did not hit my parents like they didn't hit mom and dad and then you know opposites I didn't hit mom and dad and mom or dad so my mom spanked me so my dad never hit me he doesn't like it he doesn't believe in it and he absolutely despises it my mom so there was this orange slipper and she used to hit me with it all the time because it's such a child um but it's very interesting because um within a couple of generations in Scotland it's a big no no to discipline your children via punishment like that physical punishment um and it's just like interesting to see as the generations come and go like some people might not like the emphasis like oh if you're in this age range you're gen X if you're in this you're a zoomer you're this you're that but the reason it is so purposeful and so important to have these names for generations is because there's also a lot of societal behaviors that emerge I hear Ninroop I hear it yes um and uh so like you who are listening to me right now odds are we were not raised in the exact same society with the expectations and whatever's however we are crazy enough to have the ability to set up a community like mind where we might agree on how things like should go and how things shouldn't go and we have created a pocket a pocket of a collective that can provide secondary socialization which is crazy because primary socialization is your parents but secondary is like outside outside influence and I could influence you to see the world differently through my words which is like insane um even we might not even be in the same generation and it's just as freaking socialization is fantastic stuff I will also probably write a massive stream essay I would love to talk about all this stuff in higher detail but right now we're about to do the thieves quest and I've forgotten again to get food but that's okay we're just gonna sneak on in that's right you're being educated in your will uh against your will get educated get educated get educated strongy feeding us knowledge we'll forget to feed herself honestly are you by the pope strongy sorry for interrupting but would you kindly get food and tea okay yes I will thank you um penitent I get pen in it I've asked said penitent with no teas do you become pen in it pen penny ten penny ten penny and penny in thanks for the time sorry I'm having a stroke because you've got teas in your name I will quickly go grab some food and go for a pee I highly recommend everyone who's listening to please go get some water go get some tea this is an endurance stream so we're going to be here for a little while we're going to finish the thieves quest and then we're going to dark brotherhood and then we're going to do vampire quest line because I enjoy it very much stop your knowledge is too big oh yeah you can't handle my knowledge take more take more take more um but yes please get up and stretch your legs please get some more hydration I'm gonna get a cup of tea some water I might even get a cola I'm feeling so naughty to get cola so please do get your legs a stretch and and analyze the color of your past manifest too dark then you need to hydrate more okay game food game food game food honestly you can't force the knowledge on me is it really forcing if you want it though hmm did I did I tell you that whenever I make it I guess like forbidden knowledge whenever I make an audio where I'm very our word um people really enjoy that so I just let you should know it seems to be a thing though that like anyway I'm literally standing up swiveling on my chair I will be back uh give me like four minutes to pee in a cup of tea and heat up my Liz Hagney like two minutes in the microwave sounds about right I think but yeah I'll be back in a minute okay so what shenanigans did you get up to whilst i took a big fat jobey okay i've got food lads she's been gone for 84 years i've not i've not i've been good thank you none of it's true i got cola i got a tea and i got food i'm so happy a what now like all i'm saying is the kettle was boiled and the microwave had microwaved okay we talked about the happening she's back i am back and i have food night tab out and look at marshmallows or is this gonna break the game wouldn't that be hilarious if it broke the game and i had to redo everything oh my god that would be so funny please don't do that where's my mouse got this okay we're back how do i open up marshmallow we're just gonna be stuffing our faces for a couple of minutes so i'll read marshmallow oh the toes the toes from the stream the other day hit all the right spots thank you so much for catering to your people's desires i had quite a bit of spicy time can't wait to see more of those toesies oh you'll be excited for tomorrow's stream oh my god oh that's funny is anything i want to him in your curls my curls my curled toes wow when you tape you keep your hand on the wasd keys you're a true gamer typical people keep it asdf do they have a wasd oh my god i can't believe it i'm a nerd you've caught me you have the most beautiful tiny hands in the world yeah some people said my hands were small um i'm not i don't actually i think that hands are the average size for a waman i thought i'm being funny i actually thought i was like bang on average for everything but i guess i'm not and i'm actually on the smaller side they are tiny okay like when i got the ruler oh sorry i just punched the microphone uh when i got the ruler i thought that was really fun because everyone can kind of um wasd is natural hand position yeah i definitely agree with that god you have no idea how badly i want to hold my hands i should come to our convention then i have uh i'll get a bodyguard just you know just to make sure everything's all above ground um but yeah like i can bring like all them things i don't know i feel like if someone comes to a convention to come see you like i like the idol meetings like the japanese idol meetings where they like hold your hand and you can like talk and look at each other like over the table type thing i think that's really sweet and cute but i don't know i don't know it just seems like something i don't know that's just me the asmr booth if only i wish a convention would entertain me to do that that's honestly ridiculous make sure everything's above the table honestly who would get in trouble first me or you me or are we fun let me analyze this one hey stroney is there any chance for hypnosis with helping the listener with addiction or focusing desires upon yourself from distractions um oh i'm not sure i can do stuff like that mine is always of an alternative nature for grat of the defying nature um i absolutely am not qualified or capable or doing anything that um kind of has like a i don't know what the word is but like i therapeutic yeah i would say there is any therapeutic hypnosis i can't participate in because i don't actually have the knowledge on how who goes there how to do it safely so uh safety first i will admit this is out of my league i am definitely not there and i don't think i ever will be there um 10 out of 10 i know 10 holy moly oh yeah oh did you forget when i eat i burp even more that's right the air gets trapped in these lungs lungs in this stomach i gave you my tribute cherry and no one else you're the only woman to ever ah these are supposed to be special i will mindset it in the first place oh i don't ever feel like forced to or anything but i do like that take your cherry okay hi strawney just

joke i know though also did you know that the bumps on the f and j keys on your keyboard are there so you can correctly place your hands fingers on them without looking i thought the wasd was funny i didn't know that you have taught me knowledge everyone please finger the f key and notice the bump on the f that is for positioning reasons um in light of recent events the girls have made it clear they don't want our unfaithful uh see even with your permission if they are reciprocal to slowly and dedication i'm happy for them and happy to oblige their wishes however this means that your king will be ignored my sharing i'm trying to like i'm trying to navigate this in a in a particular way i think we all know i'm trying to like get around it and um i will just have to i will have to i

cuddles during this stream this morning you ask what a fumu was in response to my comment about some plushies they're basically smug plushies of popular characters from the two whole series however they have developed a bit of a cult following due to memes and such and ended up with people making their own similar plushies like the newer someone evil newer so okay okay from makership ah yeah yes i see i see thank you am i too big for you oh that's that's a link that's a link uh we'll investigate that later on uh hi stroney thanks for the fun stream today a lot of the american sweets did not

i'm also happy for the other girls so i am too they're also sweet and talented oh i know they are absolutely adore them i can't read that one out loud because that's very that's very uh maybe in a membership stream i tried suggesting another man to make you his new oshi because he was an old-school runescape addict when he's out of the picture i'll swoop in on his wife not that i'm trying well what why are you saying you're trying to get what you're trying to get me an old-school runescape sugar daddy i've none of you have seen the runescape series so far there's just one installment oh shit management just showed up everyone front and center i i i serious you can also contact the website and mention the email you use in the mod application to get it removed okay yeah that seems fair um uh what was i saying oh yeah i literally have like 22 million gp and all i did was show up and freaking fish hi cuddles i'm currently watching the vod of today's ASMR stream since i missed it while sleeping i'm someone who has never been able to go under despite having a having a flavor for it one issue i have that i become hysterical i can't read that um uh uh-huh okay okay we have quite an effect on this replaying that's adorable i like that management quick hands above desk honestly hi i love you mommy i love you to everything the stream was incredible i'm really glad that interests you and i can't wait to see what you do next also i'm still here and she'd be streamed for you i'm devoted to you i really want to send you something but i haven't had the inspiration been really in my my emotions lately and it's really slammed my libido do i know a sad fact my alternative picture is the last time rip in the chat i've been so freaking stressed like all the time and i can't like unstress myself i think it'll calm down like once the things settle but like i'm so freaking stressed and it's such a shame but i'm sure i will get inspiration soon tm i think maybe i'll tell you what i think maybe once the monetization for everyone has been achieved i'll start to feel relaxed because like then truly is up to the girls whatever they want to do and i can just get fun shorts ordered of them but like right now i'm like oh my god there's four out of six why is the other two not come through because we applied for them all at the same time like oh no weapons if one of the girls don't get youtube monetization oh no that that's like a whole month and uh just like oh i don't oh i would be sick if i think about it we pretend we do not see but yeah the the what did i say there's a line of volunteers is extremely long thank yeah you guys want to make gentry right now i've almost finished eating and then i will slurp my honey tea and then we'll get back into the thieves guild skyrim's going good we're at um golem from the thieves guild quest we're about to be meeting the big naughty on who's trying to take down the thieves guild soon tm and um once we do the thieves guild we are going to do the dark brotherhood because i actually really enjoy it it's quite i think i think the dark brotherhood is actually relatively quick um and then we're going to do the vampires and then if we still have time we're going to do um the actual dragonborn quest line which i hate doing because it breaks the game and then if you ever like seriously want to do like a hundred percent speed run it's speed runs not speed run just a hundred percent achievements always leave it last because it breaks the game so much when you have to like say like oh we'll give white run up or we'll give this uh rifting off or we'll do this or we'll do that every day feel as how much it breaks the game but i finished my my bowl of lasagna um now i've got my my cup of tea and my cola i do i do i've got my cola no need to read this during a stream oh yeah what happens if i do it right now the ASMR stream was amazing strongy i was putting your hands during it ah that's so cute oh whoa someone is giving me a step by step gate on how to do haptic feedback penalize penalizing okay that's the law links um how down bad do you think is too down bad for you for me oh no i like i like main corruption so there's not really a down too bad i think corruption's really um up there um oh my first membership stream can be about that uh no about ranking everything penalize yes aw strongy i just want to thank you for giving all the girls a home and a family veal are such a positive part of the environment already and i'm happy to watch along with all the other reeflings oh reeflin i said also the latest patreon post is incredible did you like it i thought it was good would you let me pick on your party uh yes if you are a patreon member um another audio has gone up so there's a total of three audios up um it is spaced out for the other girls so because all the audios were uploaded on the first that did mean there's a bit of a break between the next one that comes up but as it stands everyone has a day if i can remember correctly azura monday mersey tuesday um emmy wednesday sheby thursday i see friday strongy saturday i'm not quite sure but just so you understand they are purposefully spaced out who goes there um and um they will be like every tuesday all of x's will go out on every tuesday all of like for me every saturday an audio will come out like that kind of thing um we i'm going to get the girls to post on what's inside like with the tags and everything i just need catch up time um she says as she's sitting on skyrim for an endurance stream i've got nothing but the cheek i really do i've got nothing but the cheek but i do need catch up time to get into the flow of things then next month um 100 will be like you will see what's inside if you want to subscribe for that month or not and if not then you know you can take a look at whoever else is posting maybe they've got something a bit more up to your style again i would like to repeat when it comes to the audios i have not shoehorned anyone into the same type of plot if you will because that will not financially enable them to be the content creator they'd like to be um a lot of the girls are looking at moving out possibly if they're able to receive enough support so that's why i do say if you only have enough money to support one girl please do pick a daughter of mine because um they are gunning to move out um and it means they would provide more content and yeah it's just a very positive cycle occurs um yes uh yeah i'm both meanies like not bad to kill it by emoji if you subscribe to everyone you get an audio every day i mean technically you're very close you get a rest day no one uploads on a sunday also they deserve it yes the girls work incredibly hard um ac was like am i allowed someone asked a question to ac on marshmallow like uh how do your recordings work and she was like am i allowed to talk about this and i'm like yeah you can as long as you don't see anything that's like nda obvious then yeah you can talk about how i i burst into your dms and hand you a script and all the spelling is wrong and the grammar's whack yeah you can talk about that all you like i say actual day of rest honestly um but yes thank you for thanking me for giving the girls a home but please understand the girls did it themselves they reached out to vealer they applied um they went to an interview and they were happy with everything some of them did the very thorough research uh emi actually was the most inquisitive and had the most questions azura i think she was just like is any of this real i think she thought she was dreaming because she never asked a single question after the interview um yeah azura was absolutely adorable emi asked a ton of questions which made me think she wasn't actually gonna accept the character because i told her what the character theme was and i saw people were being weird but yeah azura was like fuck it we ball indian and docs and notwithstanding they have carte blanche what carte blanche but what uh in english what in english english that's so azura honestly yeah that sounds like big mommy we ball honestly a free pass or it means like free reign oh carte blanche a blank menu is what the translation is that makes sense a free pass a blank menu oh my god i can't believe it sorry i translated it literally versus uh metaphor good uh hi sending messages scares me but i want i watched your ASMR stream and it was amazing i can't wait to see more of your stuff both ASMR and other videos they are so fantastic i'm watching you do what you love and making ASMR making via lure has me thinking i should start and follow my own you should follow your own dreams you've only got one shot i keep snail blinking please paul please don't notice me snail blinking you do you've only got one shot if you've got a dream or something you want to achieve where can go for it like if i win the lottery already know what i'm doing all i'm saying is if i win the lottery the girls are getting stacked out so i'm saying um you know the split going even higher you know oh it's always fun to try and reach for a new goal like for example hypnosis is my new goal i've always enjoyed it and always liked it but i've never made it myself because like i'm just like not skilled and i need to make sure it's safe and all that sorry i'm trying there's a fucking cat hair on my face and it's one of those cat hairs where you wipe it away and then it does a 360 look back on wherever it's freaking a caption i'm so sorry that'll be gimley honestly um but you honestly you placed everyone in their spots so well i wouldn't picture anyone else yes there is right no i'm not gonna say it because i might start up some shitters um and we ain't stirring the pot from these parts we tap the sign from these parts um let's see hi strony could you give us a hearing test like hearing test asmr of course i can do something like that for ya you do a 360 and walk away wait a minute a 180 oops wait no 360 is the circle 180 is the opposite right okay um i could absolutely do a hearing test i did a ear cleaning where i'm like muffled until as the audio progresses i'm less muffled i thought it was pretty cool i need to edit it actually it might be one of my one and four because i i owe you four this whole skyrim stream actually kind of went perfect because tomorrow i will do my monetization celebration stream where everyone can absolutely laugh and i'm pretty sure someone's probably already guessed what i've got planned for it there's no way after yesterday's stream someone hasn't put two and two together and knows why i got a pedicure in particular i refuse i refuse she fell for the oldest these xbox joke honestly do a 540 believe it um my body prevented me from my dream so i come about have you ever had an actual medical ear cleaning i've not had a medical ear cleaning but i did get my hearing checked as a child um because i was ignoring my mum where i was undiagnosed it was my idea actually um i'm going to sip my tea before it gets too cold okay eh yeah my mum got me uh sent to a hearing test because she was sitting at my dad she was like strony doesn't he listen to me like strony strony never hears me and i used to do this thing where i sat right in front of the tv so the tv was on a stand but i would sit directly under it so my neck was looking directly upward sorry i just hit the mic there by uh i know you can't see my hands but my mic was at my mic my neck was directly upwards looking at the tv like pure pure in a trance like straight up like tizm a doctor walked in and tizm was the diagnosis type thing and obviously my mum didn't know what it was all about at the time so i got sent for a hearing test and she was like the wife that did the hearing test on me she was like oh no pet you're hearing spain i don't know what's going on with you um and yeah basically that was that's when the signs start to show and then now here i am someone who has to read and write for a living and goodness gravey is it freaking hard i'm slurping is she okay nah she's just fucking hella autistic a kid with autism how close were you to the tv oh i'm not being funny when i'm like i was directly below the tv i like i was sitting crisscross looking directly up at the tv and my neck was up in the air like it and i and my mum ascertained that it was hearing issues rather than something else maybe going on she had a case of strontism honestly the strontism's too strong um that's not good for your eyes oh well i do actually need to be wearing my glicks but i'm making it work okay i was right in the vtuber collab scripts and i was like this is too small this text so i zoomed in and i'm like oh my god i'm gonna be a blind as a fish like really soon wait that's literally me as a kid literally do you reckon cuttlefish have actual autism um as an uncertified marine biologist anything is possible if you didn't know down syndrome is possible in animals as well um i believe down syndrome is the deletion of chrome zone oh god what is it in humans uh not 32 that's not right i can't remember which deletion it is but it can happen in gorillas seriously i'm not even kidding look up down some down syndrome gorilla and like it's fucking creepy oh it's an extra edition of 21 sorry yeah i'm thinking of the deletion one what is the deletion one called that i always watch documentaries about it happens when life deletes 32 yes um actually spindle fiber failure um uh which is i um i find it really interesting oh god i feel like every time i'm like i find this so interesting and fascinating it leads to me rambling about something that you guys couldn't give less of a shit about i feel really bad but at the same time i really like blabbing away so i'm like that just do it that just tell you about um fertilization so the reason why the rate of down syndrome goes up dramatically the older the woman is beyond the age of 25 yes the age of 25 um you're you're already hitting the wall at 25 rip um the reason it goes up exponentially is because the failure of the spindle fibers that's what pulls apart um that's what pulls it apart and then results in a the an additional chromosome wiggling about which is the rise of down syndrome which is why women who um are having children later in life are often advised to do what is uh referred to as a DNA test which i've completely forgotten the name of but basically they pierce the amniotic sac and take a tiny cell sample of the baby and then check its DNA sequence under um you know get it because to see if the child has down syndrome or not and then either they're advised would you like to terminate or not or bring to term whatever type thing goes on but um it definitely is a risk and uh like also being obese with the child as well results in gestational diabetes which is very dangerous for the child very dangerous for the mum um there's also um if depending on the blood type of the mother and the blood type of the child the mother during the entire pregnancy her body can be attacking the baby until it um has a natural um abortion if you didn't know abortion is the natural term but you can also get a medical abortion but abortion is the natural term for it just happening and there are many reasons why it can never come to term how do you know all this stuff is fascinating no i don't go to school i like watching youtube videos about um biology related things i have a fascination in uh diagnoses in particular like why the reason it occurs for example um like uh there's this syndrome uh of course it evades my mind i think it's called like william hunter syndrome where the child or the well the child that can become an adult um because you you do not pass away uh unless you have complications with other diseases for example um you will never experience the sensation of being full uh you will constantly eat um there's like hereditary syndromes as well like hunter syndrome which is pretty uh devastating um there's interesting one such as dwarfism dwarfism can actually be passed on by two individuals who visually do not have any um display of any dwarf uh ism genetics um but it is a recessive gene uh and if the two people come together um yep you can have it how do you know all this reefling that obviously has not got the autism angel man syndrome is that angel man syndrome is that the one where the child is locked in the child like say i believe so mentally they can't develop any further um uh yes uh Harley Quinn syndrome um doesn't sound like what it is it's where your skin constantly your skin regenerates so fast that you flake and you break and it's just absolute it is a living heck for those poor uh like children that are born but you can make it to adulthood um there's a lot of sad um diagnoses that you can get like you can get childhood dementia those are quite crushing ones um stroneys institute for the gift to take you up angel man is the eaten one is it Harley Quinn issues yeah as door is dwarfism classified only is being short there are a redonkulous amount of dwarfism classifications um some can be like no stunted growth on the abdomen uh other versions are no stunted growth on the arms and the legs but the um organ holder area if you will for lack of better words abdomen all that and chest and that like there's so many different classifications is quite um it's quite fascinating stuff when she uh get into torso yeah torso will do just nicely i remember when the photos of those babies were used as shock foot yeah unfortunately um kind of if you use older like if you look up like Freud stuff for example you get quite a few older photos that are like Freud Freud you didn't have to photograph that mate like you know do you know about prisons yeah like the stanley prison experiment and how people play roles that they perceive to be superior uh absolutely fascinating stuff i do and enjoy the psychology it has to offer um i think humans and our everyday socialization were always kind of it's always insinuated that there's someone to look up to but i am a big believer in the three um three perspective talk and it's like parent to parent child to child adult to parent or something like that and it's like the three ways you can communicate with someone he said prions oh not prisons my apology i was talking about the the stanley prison experiment prions uh no a little bit about prions not not not too much sorry i just read what i wanted to read prudder's williams syndrome oh prudder willie syndrome that sounds like um i'll just mix them up yes prions diseases are horrifying um did you know about the family of blue people from generations of i know there's a family that's like on youtube because someone goes and films them and they communicate via barks because they have so many issues it's such a shame i want this woman to yank me for the rest of my life honestly uh well that speaking of prions um what is it rabid rickin bites you what's that called as soon as you develop um water phobia water phobia hydrophobic water phobia once you develop hydrophobia rabies that's it once you develop hydrophobia you have a hundred percent um loss rate you can't win it is it is some scary stuff and and to think that we are very lucky to avoid this by getting a simple tetanus shot um it turns out in test was not Winston are you squiddling me right now i'm not i'm sorry for the interruption no no on side note strani teacher outfit when oh i mean i'm down like i'm i'm down to clown you want strani teach you'll maybe your teacher i'll be your i can teach you a few things i would do down for that maybe i shouldn't make an audio about that um i've a a bit of a i have some leaks so close your ears if you don't want to hear about the audio leaks uh uh referring to my gen mates um so the new audio uh i don't know master manager wherever the frick you want to call him um is now in place uh there is like a i told you that she be has a four part series it's absolutely magnificent i've read it and i love it as there is four part series is now coming together oh my gosh golly if you like the being pampered being called a good boy or feeling little oh my you are eating good i don't even have a wee willy wink sausage i i'm appreciating that i saw him say i'm appreciating what is being put down uh emise uh is coming through um i actually need to send off a note because i accidentally wrote emise part one uh to our four part series which is a big mistake because having too many cooks spoils the broth especially when it comes to bloody scripts i can assure you that much uh um what uh mercedes is overall like a you finally accept being with the yandere and some people don't like that there's resistance i comprehend but in this one i want her to be resistant and then she breaks you okay that's what i want okay and what i want go i can't remember what aces is i remember aces but damn strongly are you the tower of babel because you are stacked in defiance of god and i cannot speak coherently when you go down oh thank you for the tip and oh my god babel babel babel babel wow brian i can't believe you even said that out loud honestly um are they gonna be on patreon they are gonna be on patreon please do uh don't however wait until the don't if you're like i do not have the money to support these girls do not worry you can do it for free by liking their streams and hanging out even if you're lurking it's perfectly fine um and then you might be seeing yourself but if i don't give money i don't get access to certain content while this is true wait until the don't know thorns i have purposely made the effort for goals to be public access um now please don't get me wrong there still be rewards for those who can but i have purposely pushed for public access rewards once goals have been met please let me try and cook it's very hard to find a good balance who goes there i don't find myself um but yes i am i am trying my best to find the perfect thing we've already undercut the market severely price point wise on patreon um and we hope that through showing the lack of greed the lack of greed uh that you know don't worry like even if you can't pay we're we've got you okay we've got you uh we'll hook you up okay let me just oh there we go let's play some skyrim is anyone anyone want some room on their sky right here we go i'm in oh that's bloody loud i never have my own right where where are we where where are we the tower of babble is the old story about man about a man's hubris and defiance of god and the reason they allegedly that man speak isn't that tower of babel on or am i getting my bees mixed up my babel and the tower of babel babalon access stability no greed and moments company i gotta go on a jog and enjoy your jog i'd say listen to the stream but you might be bricked up by the time you're it's the tower of babel okay wait is babel on just a location then stantic book to carry where azura what are you doing in my game azura what's going on azura are you going to the high ground what you're doing what you're gonna do once you're up here huh what you're gonna do once you're up here nothing oh you're still going oh my god she's still going azura where where are you supposed to go azura is absolutely lagging i'm not i'm not lying she's absolutely lagging it oh i heard that that plot babalon is the whole horror babalon thing oh i've been playing too much i oh my gosh right that's it oh i like that okay she can beat him up it's fine i like that he's just dodging and then i just did one big oh i said steal oh no wait a minute that's against the law i'm a good fantasy rule player i broke her stance you know what else i'll break her hymen okay you're done where is it where's the enemy oh he's uh oh i didn't even saw that man i really do need my glasses oh that's terrible legit i thought you were talking about skyrim's azura azura isn't even in this i thought skyrim didn't have azura maybe azura's star are wait is this not it eh wait what how come crazy is this not it oh hello oh my god i've gone way too far ahead of the plot i've gone way too far ahead of the plot i've not even spoken to the guy to get him to move i was so confused why the trap door wasn't open up oh azura gets you to clean out her star right you're done i'm not not you're done didn't even get to the the first message i read in chat after like a couple of minutes of combat that's terrible yeah azura's star is i uh thought it was on i'm literally speedrun the plot i've gone like 10 leagues ahead i do apologize babel is where humanity teamed up to build a tower to heaven and knocked it down and um honestly it's quite interesting how no i can't say that unfortunately um base i'm speedrunning the plot yeah i've been playing too much binding of isaac oh my god wait have i said i'm i'm like nine eight percent sure i've actually already said this but some of the girls are into tarot cards they're called um and it's the funniest thing ever and the reason why it's funny is my only exposure to tarot cards is the binding of isaac okay which means whenever they're talking about like pool and cards or whatever they're like the tower card and i'm like yes yes six bombs six bombs you can probably unlock like a secret um like a tinted rock and get like a soul heart from it yes and like the lovers yes you can get two hearts if you can find a donation machine maybe you can get some coins out of it i'm like oh goodness sake like all of them must be rolling their eyes that my only experience like the freaking the hanged man uh oh yeah um that's fantastic i can uh i can fly in the room like position or the full card oh yeah it takes me back to the starting of the the map oh that's amazing that's amazing uh hey i'm just gonna skip this part because i don't really need to see it um can you speak a little bit about your plans for membership no bother you shoot before but you're honestly worth it oh my god stop you're gonna make me blush um i will most likely do two memberships uh streams a week um most likely a Samar membership is probably the most requested i also like doing watch alongs um some stream snipe games uh maybe for more close things um maybe i did maybe i i don't care what you promise if i tell you the buyer's name hasn't learned you kill me well i have a body okay it looks like only bribery works on him um two i mean yeah i want to make it worth your money like the way i try to think of it in my head is how much do you pay for like a movie ticket for like one and a half hours entertainment okay i'ma take that and then double it and then double it again so i'm like okay i'll try to stream every single day i'll also try to offer membership streams at least twice a week that seems fair that means in total for the membership not only do you directly support me and future projects gentle and the projects the girls want to pursue soon but we can't talk about any of it yet um and it means like also get like a more i suppose like a more intimate stream experience of people like that um like seventeen dollars for a movie ticket that's outrageous um gen two confirmed live on the stream stocks i remember the first time i did this quest i was so nervous about like all the guards coming at me but they don't even care hanged man to we we hingees well you do watch together streams for members i absolutely would love to do that yes we can a hundred percent do that gen two spoiled live no clickbait oh you just wait until the zers don't a thumb for that if you want to see one of the concepts but not all i don't really talk about it in the server with the girls out of respect because of uh a miscommunication on my part and honestly it's kind of easier it's much easier to go you know oh shit my bad you're right then to like explain in mass detail like what the most communication was you know like it is what it is gen two is just she be with a different voice and a real color i'm actually getting her take this a chocolate skin at some point i'm probably doing it within the next one i brought in the coin and what not at all we're just skipping through the dialogue that can't be our skin into this look now since our transaction is done i love the gen two memes but gen one 3d though um the girls are all very interested in 3d the problem is i don't know i think i'm saying about it i don't have a heart no you should think about staying the night uh wait i know one of those songs but she doesn't sing it it's rodrick rodrick there's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit sure what can i do for you um no there once was a hero named ragnar the rest who came riding to white run from old rodrick stand all this ragged and ragged and brandish his blade as he told the old stories and gold that he made i can't remember the rest i need the rest of it it's in another end i said another end she doesn't go here right we're just gonna if you want to skip this quest literally just time sink and he will teleport because it's just such a whatever way you go about it you know the 3d will be lit yeah i don't have a clue like they maybe had like such a gorgeous 3d model but i'm like 9 in percent sure that shitting vr chat um but i don't know what it is and i'm not sure any of the girls have 3d experience either to help me out the best i can do is like 3d vr chat but i don't know if that's disappointing for them um i will maybe ask sin sin is vr chat i asked her and i was quite happy with her model like um and i think that's like what the girls are if they're one 3d like that's all of god you know um i'll be a learning experience for all vr chat streams being created with you know could you imagine acs dg sessions in pure chat yeah it's it's not necessarily a lot of work because i just oh you can't wait in this location dumb game we're forcing you east empire company warehouse i wonder if that was by the british empire british um so this level you're supposed to like lurk from the sky but yeah i need to offer the girls um what are they called all the trackers but i myself don't actually know what trackers they need and i don't know what the full price point is like i've been really open and honest with the girls and been like obviously once everyone's monetized we can see what kind of money you're earning and if it's good it's bad like because obviously if the girls money's low they're not going to want to stick around are they um so i do have some kind of like mildly boosting efforts but it's not really yeah you know it's kind of when you're on the managing side it's kind of like i can only do so much with what the girls give me very thankfully the girls are giving me they're all like literally everyone streamed every single day which was insane uh within reason of course um and like they're taking it a bit more easy this week which i'm very glad to see we do almost i'm a sneak increase yeah or do you think he notices me at all yeah no uh there are some really nice uh things you can do in vr chat i have seen something i didn't what detected me oh oh no he's discovering all the dead bodies along the way but he doesn't find that suspicious like at all i don't know if my my poor heart can take stronti in 3d it would be so fun because you can see how like animated at um i thought about doing a dance 3d stream where like i play music that you guys suggest and like we just dance and drink and stuff i don't know is that weird just a body nothing so so literally oh well mustn't be anything um i thought that would be cute like rating your songs and stuff but i don't know how good the tracking is like because i want i want to see my butt jiggle i won't be twerking and stuff i know the year is transpiring and it's really endearing how committed you are to making sure everyone eats good both the talents and fun it's right here in my favor i just uh is he gonna just checked me i mean clearly just doesn't care if someone go oh um 3d stronti hypnotizes you that'll be interesting like i just don't know how 3d works at all i think vain or like sony notes are the default for most tracking i've seen vr avatars with pendulum and spiral tall everyone just the exception okay so he does a little uh jabate where he actually comes walking back which is why i'm hanging back right now because he's a wee liar um but yeah 3d definitely on the cards we're just obviously we're kind of in the recoup funds stage um and kind of seeing where everyone is of everyone happy like i sent the girls all the message i was like is there anything i can do to make your experience better like how do you feel after your first week and i got like a lot of good feedback so um i'm just gonna be getting ready to get the girls shorts more consistently because it's taking me a hot second to get shorts that i was hoping to at least get them like two a week out right now it's like one a week oops and that's just because i suck and i'm gonna fall in the water stronti but don't jiggle jiggle it falls my money don't jiggle jiggle it falls i like to see you wiggle wiggle for sure by the way when our membership expected to become available on tomorrow's stream um i'm gonna get it all set up um and all of that so tomorrow's stream isn't gonna be skyrim uh we're not gonna do full achievements because i don't know why my achievements aren't working uh there are enemies all over here but you can just go swinging you picked a bad time to get lost i think if this is no there is a health potion stacked over there somewhere i remember correctly oh i thought there was a health potion here i guess no it's just wine close enough we can sell these potion of strength so there's just spiders in there i don't know if there's anything else you can just go willy nilly through this it's not really um no magic i hate magic i don't want to go i can literally hear that spider in that cave it's membership gonna stream yeah it's tomorrow so the the skyrim part two is getting steam rolled over to make way for the monetization stream and then i'm like a hundred percent sure you guys know exactly what i'm doing tomorrow it's not even gonna be a surprise at this point um but just yeah this is just gonna be a one-off skyrim achievement if the achievements were working then yeah but i don't know why they're not uh so we might actually do a calming a bit earlier than expected she be as live again yes she be cotton boom any any cotton boom um oh my yeah oh he's armored up who's next archer i have no idea what she's doing i'm just stupid to figure out are you wait do you know do you guys wait just take a guess at what you think my monetization stream tomorrow is take a guess and i'll see if you guys know i'll tell you if you got it right or not right where's the guy you should be here oh there is right yeah feet yeah okay feet stream it's feet ASMR i'm gonna have the camera on my feet and because i have dexterity in my toes i'm literally gonna hold the ASMR tools with my toes and do like ASMR feet stream that's fine yeah feet yeah it's ridiculous i know yeah i know it's ridiculous but i thought it was funny as anything and because my model has like french tip toes i thought like yeah this is perfect i don't think my other toes are gonna heal in time for it though unfortunately it's pretty mangled i don't i don't think i have to go to the doctor i think i have to go to the doctor if it starts getting inflamed you needed to know more now tell you what consider me your new friend in the north i'm keeping the deed any objections consider it a carlaya didn't even want it why did carlaya purchase the golden state now that i know who she may even uh if i was maven exactly this carlaya must have spent a lot of time would be demonetized i mean can you get demonetized it's literally just fee like uh if you cannot take away the ha ha funny from it it's literally just the body part and ASMR and like me is that dog um i heard that gods could you get any more perfect last the only concept i came up for like my monetization celebration people walk on their feet all the time yeah like i just think it's more like funny ha ha than it is like anything else but like i this time so i don't keep repeating it but i generally like feel so feminine now that i've got like my little manicure pedicure like i felt so pampered like i was completely uncomfortable with the entire situation but i did feel really pampered and i was like oh this is actually kind of nice hold on a minute hold on a minute these gender norms have hands god damn it not again i've fallen for another one this is too difficult it's too difficult i can't resist i thought i could can you really not jump this oh fine you are very feminine literally like apparently my hands are super small as well like oh these gender norms have hands foot rubs though i will admit the foot rub that felt like heavenly oh my god like my like brain was like a wire and funny i was like hold on this is like super relaxing i can't believe it all the freaking stereotypes about whamming like in foot rubs are true it's awful i felt i felt so good though i was like damn i need a need a reflin right now i need a need a sacrificial a sacrificial reflin right now oh can i do that at the convention if we do a convention oh my god i'm literally going through all the sky room right now just to get to the other side of the map e strong easy girl i can't believe it i'm more impressed with how dexterity how much dexterity you have for your toes honestly my grippers on a rung you'll never guess what i'm sitting on right take a guess what did you need i volunteer literally should i just do that where you're like massage my feet at the convention uh he said oh wait no i have sweaty feet oh i can't let yous do that the reason why the women could do it is because i had to put my feet in like this little water bath so she had no clue that she was dealing with the sweaty feet so we're now learning that carlaya is this evil evil trying to take down the thieves guild so we're gonna meet and mercer free or sorry mercer free and i if you want the correct english are going to go and confront them um and it's called scoundrels foley oh no i've just completed that i'm actually such a lawyer oh wait i need i'm freaking sick it says exchange a piece of armor but we're about to get more armor anyway so it's fine don't worry guys i'll take one for the team everyone here volunteer and to be sacrificial refund not for refunds what have i done is honestly uh no way this is like the closest landmark it's gonna be a bit of a walk i feel like i'm still level one why do i refuse to level up is level up it doesn't matter what you're sitting on we cry because it's not us right there's someone on i don't know if you guys like you swear much but there's someone on twitter literally called like mummy's chair and uh freaking heho every time i see them i'm like that name's hilarious like your guys's names on runescape were hilarious as well and you guys so funny just travel to whiterun stable and buy a carry oh you are actually so correct however we might meet sisero on the road so there is a chance i have faith let's run that guy literally not down the skin whoa who are you oh you're a kaji are you marquette the liar you don't wish me well oh what do you have on your prayer skimmer he's getting high if you didn't know the kaji have a really bad habit with skimmer you found him i knew i recognized i was like is that the liar of course he's a skimmer literally got nothing on his persons but three skimmer he is set for life oh my god we flings we have reform look at that chicken butt chicken butt chicken butt what oh Lydia no way she dances with me what what chicken butt what what chicken butt no no no no no no no no i like how she mimics me chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken oh look it's your egg oh you have so many eggs oh my god this is exactly what i want is this what older like chicken head covers are still like that's amazing oh my god i would absolutely love to do a stream about the domestication of animals as well think of how many endless animal species we have and there's only i think 11 domesticated species isn't that amazing although there was one russian guy who tried to domesticate foxes and he actually got really far but it does take years and years and you can hypnotize the chicken by drawing the line and dirt in front of them oh oh i was a little moan to hit there please email them thank you there's a little shack down here domesticated foxes would be adorable they would oh there's a bear in this shack i recognize this place from many i totally i've never heard a wolf how will like that before but Lydia can you deal with them so i don't have to slow down i'm trying to make it to the location there is probably bandits here actually that's one thing i do have to complain about scarring there's like bandits in every freaking place ever literally i've not even approached this landmark and it's like yeah bandits by the way it's like bro i didn't even get a freaking chance to breathe there's always a bear foxes are difficult the worst part is they pee on everything fox girl gen 2 confirmed made it into peeler confirmed right there's a stable over here so we're gonna head for it what's the difference between taming and domesticating taming is temporary friendship whereas domestication anyone can take over with it i think because you can tame a wild hedgehog but you can't domesticate it yeah no that kind of sounds like i'm on the right tracks but i did just i don't actually know the real can you please discover that thank you peeler my beloved peeler confirmed by strongy fox girl for peeler oh my only reason they're in is because of the the content the girls like to put up domestication is an extremely long process of taming yes i would agree with that statement well they put fast travel on so they had to compensate for people who'd fast travel instead of walk and they need more bandits oh bro every time you want to walk like two centimeters of the game's like enemy enemy enemy enemy taming is when you train a wild animal to be friendly around humans domestications when you breed an animal over multiple generations to benefit a human yes so a lot of people don't know that sheep um infinitely grow will that's because of human selective breeding that they produce so much will and they've now require to be shaved like you ever hear those stories that make the news that's like this sheep evaded the farmer for five years and he has five years of like mats on him and the only reason that's actually even mildly possible is because he was bred that way he was bred to produce like copious amounts of wool and and it's like the same for horses you know how horses need little clippy cloppy horses the reason for that is because of selective breeding and and horse in the wild will naturally wear down it's rocks it's hooves on rocks and stuff like that and what is going on here who's this rk um right yeah silkworms we use for silk can't survive in the world yeah i would really love to do a domestication thing um i'd love to do a history one i just saw that on a per Fox that wolf garden huh i don't think i've ever seen a sheep on the news yeah when you come from Scotland sometimes the news is rather bland um you know not a lot going on in school if you watch the Scottish news oh no he didn't meet why why does the horse who's horse is that hello i'm sorry i'm late hydration check i've scouted the ruins and i'm certain carlaya is still inside you saw her no i found her horse don't take care of it the horse didn't need to perish let's get moving i want to catch her inside while she's distracted take the lead you want me to lead understood just make certain you keep your eyes open carlaya is a selectively breeding stuff for you can't say that that's hilarious you can't say that oh my god that's so true what the fuck that's so funny i'm sorry i can't even laugh at that that's so funny i'd rather the news be bland than hyperpolarizing oh i don't even consume the news anymore where where are you bro i can hear your armor what are you doing okay there you are jeez it's ironic because she's growing so much will have actually become a deficient sheep farmers don't make any money from those synthetic fibers if the police will we have to go back we need to go back please please no more plastic i'd like same i hate watching the yeah like it's just unwatchable it just you you will finish a news broadcast um and you're just like wow i hate life and it was like don't if if you consume things that like genuinely make you more upset at the end of them it's it can be quite addictive and comforting to like watch it in the moment but when you realize it's bad for you like you can just kind of poach trump on it you know come back another time uh there are drogger up ahead but it's not anything you can't handle the drogger i'm actually gonna loot them the reason because a lot of drogger drop um soul gems which i'm needing a heck of a lot more of i said they drop soul gems soul gems se o a o gems i can see that but i don't mean whoa okay sorry i'm sorry please forgive me for pill in the lever i didn't mean i promise i won't do it again okay they're just dropping gems i couldn't freaking uh i didn't even get a chance to wiggle it no no oh oh potions lovely i'll sell them for pennies honestly will is still warm even wait sorry sorry i was looking at the corner of my eye oh i can so ends the lesson uh drogger don't usually have soul gems wait who do i think have soul gems on them oh the the centaurians have um the the good golden guys no i'm like going left side i'm like okay there we go so many soul gems okay they just have gold on them apparently we get it your feeble attempts he's like so into it nope don't ask me how long it took me to find the opening to this so my first playthrough it's so painful this was my first ever um skyrim game actually my dad played morrowind um but my my favorite thing about morrowind is that you can just jump on the spot um and then like you level up your stamina it's quite interesting you mean elder school's game yeah wait what did i say my first skyrim game i'm like dumb dumb and he i was gonna say it's even oh no not me right now ryan hey strongy i wanted to ask you something yeah i know you can speak scott but i was curious to know if you knew gaelic as well cause if i remember correctly there's not that many people left in scotland that can speak it no they don't teach us that uh if you come from the mainland you don't learn gaelic at all um it's basically a dying language because they refuse to teach it to the next generation i don't know if it's gonna change i hope it'll change in the future but sadly no i do not speak gaelic which is just how it is they do not teach it and oh pretty ship um but thank you for the tip narrow yes uh very sadly they they don't teach it uh if you're from the mainland of scotland and i am from the mainland of scotland if you didn't know lovely little uh skull wait no did i mean to do that i don't think i meant to do that did i um if i didn't come from the mainland and i came from the shetland for example which is at the north some it's okay if you don't really know scotland that well um where the heck is this red on the map did i get up am i going the right way yell skeever okay i'm going the right way i don't know how to do that that's so sad gaelic is one of the very few Celtic languages i left yeah like um scotland and ireland and all that were like pagan fuck it hell this is all enemies got enemies got a lot of enemies i'm just swinging i'm just swinging it around like new ones business honestly me if i was a guy i'd be elephant and that stuff up wow wow i'm 42 i'm leveling up faster than my fishing and runescape right although you still need a trans a translator for glass region yes the scots is the he just like went flying uh you really wanted that um there's poison darts if i remember correctly yeah i'm just too good i just remember everything um yes i am very lucky that i do have scots at least which is recognized as its own language which is really cool uh i know it sounds like i'm like speaking it's because i don't use slang at all like at all uh oh we're almost there oh we're almost there yeah i don't yeah i don't need to um uh i'm completely for all what was the happen about i hate these guys because they can yeah they can disarm you which i don't like wait he he has special huh i've never seen this before this is not freaking xbox certified flawed barla stone what the heck is that why why did why did pc yell these cool things what the heck is a wireless stone can you do a fool on scottish stream uh i mean if you mean slang i can only really do it for like a couple of minutes because it's just like i get more mumbly and like oh good morning good evening good afternoon and all that who's it going like it just does they really sound that good and i don't think it's that relaxing either like and i kind of hate to put it on because my mom was like no then he speaks slang in the house so i didn't and then obviously being an online creator it's a complete opposite everyone wants to hear you with a slang in every hand and it's like oh right then i guess it's a bit uh it's a bit forced because i was discouraged from speaking slang these doors have a weakness pc got updates xbox charges per update thus pc got lots of content and xbox charges per update headed in on that uh it's just a bit pointless like when english is still common yeah like oh i ain't looking good i ain't looking good i'm gonna take a nap right here can you talk dirty scott if you want and a member stream sure yeah i remember liby saying some scott's can't pronounce but yeah so if i say it how about normally a nuncy purple burglar alarm like i can't do it but if i put on a harsh accent my tongue gets caught at the back of my mouth like a purple burglar alarm like a la la la la you can hear that yuki's temper is gone forever it was the first lesson gallus talk to us hey sweet ania still be alive gallus had his wealth and he had you all he had to do was look the other way did you forget the oath we talk as nightingale did you expect him to simply ignore your methods and all the most recent versions of the game my ps4 even got these updates from the night it's time for you and gallus to become reunited okay lol it's okay you're still very door but snap it will make me blue i was going to make you say purple burglar after my first super chat i said that before she was like how long until someone asked for purple burglar alarm because it's quite common to be asked to say it and like i hope i don't sound midi like when i do it because i'm like for people who watch long term they'll know like how often i get asked it but for people who like pop in for the first time i don't want to be rude and be like uh like i've already said it like five times today like i get the max it's different like i don't want to be rude like that uh you know what fuck off sin sister hi sin honestly he sins his regard yeah we need i need to throw back on the tax spitting on the beat oh right no let's not finish that one um you need to do a song cover with me like a scottish one what's that i'm just like forcing you

a unique if you're gonna be rude at least over your best accent had i intended to kill we wouldn't be having this conversation why save me my original intention was to use that arrow on mercer but i never had a clear shot i made a split oh hi lydia two girls give you a fucking street oh my god that's awful then i'm in your d that's all no i meant i meant like a youtube like wholesome club but if you want to do one like that i ain't stopping you i am alive to to tourist attraction girls show you how good scottland can really be that's ridiculous you can't say that i wish i knew perhaps it could be translated it's the only outsider that there were things we're here take these as well they prove useful for your journey uh thank you hard answers speak with right we need to go talk to a little at winter hold hi hen let me sit here and laugh through your dirty weekend it's so cursed scottishly smart it's so cursed it's terrible i did a i did a plot recently sin and it was like it

like that there's no locks on this door oh yeah oh we might get caught oh and it's just awful you make it sound like we don't like it i think it just makes me grimace call me a shake because it makes me grimace do the Harlem shake whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop and folk wonder why folk would default America for audios what a folk actually what that show oh i'm getting absolutely right today hold on i completely missed that swing but oh that i don't want to slow more like come on that will just hunt and i'm not being funny we have successfully eradicated oh what's this oh what's going on here we need to find our way to solid you oh what's this oh that's related to the dark brotherhood so Cicero could have been there but Cicero wasn't i'm just gonna discover this a mating complex just because whistling may oh mercy can't whistle by the way literally scottie is the most complete point you see awful i say it's absolutely amazing yeah apparently mercy can't whistle only discovered that yesterday i'm like uh what do you mean you can't whistle i was like oh my god her mouth is so small that it will and ironically though that's candy whistle and then she went we love your accent we found out recently too you know she tried it with you i might just to just to ramp up the maximum embarrassment i might clip it uh and make it short on her channel and be like a adorable uh vtuber tries to whistle or something like that and it's just her just going i can't whistle lung problems so god damn you got cystic fibrosis need pop you on the wee wiggle machine would i call it the the lung wiggle machine i didn't learn to whistle until 16 mm it took me so long to get it like my grandad can do that thing where you put like two fingers at the corner of your mouth and then go hewie i can't do that but it's ear piercingly low like ear piercingly low that'd be great mercy is adorable of me i'm sorry could you describe the smell can i help you with anything else carlaya do you have gallas's journal yes but there's a problem no this is do a video one thing that each member can't do whistles for mercy no uh mine's like maybe mine's like don't stream for the day that'll be my challenge don't don't accidentally do an endurance right speak to who i'm just getting bounced around this map you know that would you like me to describe the smell or will i get you a box wait that's a lord of the rings reference wait a minute i recognize that lord of the rings reference anywhere because no one says get me a box oh something all the way why why are you putting me places i haven't discovered before time to decor well i didn't mean that for those who want to recover magical faster but are more susceptible to damage well that's an absolute rubbish payoff now stroney will say something that involves rolling arse oh what's wrong rifling do you not like the way i say my arse after almost five hours of hearing your stream at two times i'm finally caught up hi you can listen to me normally i promise i'm not a squeaker i'm sorry you thought i was a squeaker why is there spitters come here no come here i just want to talk i want to shake your hand i want to shake your hand what was that about the apprentice don't suck no stream for one day we'll get separation i say brav i've been waking up with the worst anxiety ever and i'm but it goes away the moment i stream and i'm like shit i literally there's a hag in this hot i am like 99 percent sure that i remember a hag being in this hot hold on am i going crazy is this not got a big beast in it oh no it's a person oh oh he didn't make it hold on oh well there you go speak to cruise to it for i thought this was the hot hi mommy i'm back from my jog yay you didn't get a bone bone more jogging so congrats on your work remember to replenish your electrolytes by adding salt extra salt into your diet the mutual separation anxiety is bad i mean it's like good and bad like but when i wake up it's like like that kind of things i but like as soon as i like start like setting up my pc i make like a cup of honey oh my god you're so adorable mud crab for gen 2 confirmed oh you're so cute i love you i'm not even gonna hurt you he's just a little aggressive okay he's just a wee bit aggressive the hack out you're thinking of is outside riverwood oh this looks like a dragon's grave if i've ever seen one or not maybe not i don't know hey crab girl sees a creature gen 2 confirmed i'm just teasing you guys with that by the way merchant's journal okay hold on what happened here i begged my husband not to go but he just wouldn't listen he said if he delayed the shipment even another week the legion would find someone else to take it south let them keep their blasted money the road to white run is dangerous he says everyone knows that so many caravans have been attacked so many travelers vanishing in thin air some say it's only bandits but they're rumors are worse goblins ghosts and witches 20 years we've been married now and i can't bear the thought of losing them i'm not letting them go alone not this time we'll deliver die together together mara preservas oh where's the man oh no oh who to who to uh it's terrible picks up coins oh who did that that's terrible uh coconut crab vtuber oh isn't that not that massive gigantic crab v sucky is gen 2's name by the way yeah gen 2 already i already have the logos for gen 2 and three maids um because they were they it was like cheap and it was like i might as well well as the matter because i already know what i'm gonna call them i'm just gonna discover this location i don't know if we're gonna start going against the force one shortly there are another type of bandits essentially uh right how'd i get around i guess i get around oh no rubs corpses look they're not gonna need it let's be honest they're not gonna need that those nine coins gen 3 spoiled no there's absolutely nothing planned of gen 3 i don't even know what concepts i want um and stroney did you see what you want yes what i want i submit what i want and then i get back something and then i keep going to the drawing board that's how it works so you're at my mercy shoulda picked mercy you can't purchase in the afterlife gen 6 confront absolutely no i i am done birthing any children after gen 3 i mean it's also like uh there's a whole other thing to it there's actually a whole other trust factor as well like gen one i completely trust whole heartedly like i did my thorough research on the girls and like when i when i did the interview like i never got any bad vibes or whatever um which sounds terrible like oh you did an interview like an informal interview and went off of was there bad vibes or not and the answer is yeah i did actually um because and when you hear people talk you can get a sense of like especially when they expected like a super um like a super professional thing and you're just like oh surprise it's actually just me me man uh here's here's the rules type thing um mercy's patreon just went live oh she got an update i can't even remember what her update was i i don't know i don't know what the tags are even though i was the one who put that up there for her sounds like you got a trust your gut yeah like i get described as naive a lot which i honestly don't mind i actually genuinely agree with that and kind of assassin sorry i'm just trying to hit loads of markers along the way so we can just backtrack like this super easily um oh is this like a little hunter's lodge thing going on oh it's like a little campsite oh just we eat and good tonight after three generations there's a real risk of bad actors trying to get in it yeah so because i need to choose my words carefully but i hope you can agree with um my my my thought process but it may not be reality because it's just my thought process um it is very plausible that there were v-tubers who were interested but didn't apply because they wanted the guaranteed success of gen 2 like to see what gen 1 achieved to see what gen 2 achieved because not that they didn't put their faith in the plan um it's not so obviously you want to you want to be a part something that's successful let's wait am i on the right way or am i on the wrong way no i'm gonna run um i need to try and think of my sense just like i'm really happy with gen 1 and everyone is good basically however the rate as you said the rate of a bad actor coming into play does get higher um but hopefully you know there's girls like with you know plenty of experience and i can just see and assess them you don't want to risk the gamble yes it's like i don't know how to say that i just knew all the girl i'm trying to have a really nice moment talking about my girls okay um the risk does get higher when new people are introduced that may not have previous history like um what the heck what am i trying to where the heck am i trying to go you can't see me um i think you're doing the right thing you don't want to feel like you're investing your time into the wrong thing yes that like um i did speak of someone who applied and then i went on their twitch just to check them out in general and they spoke about how they only want to hang around for one year and then send their audience to their old account and the quote was like because the creator seems so chill or something and i got an in route um and it was just like kind of shocking and it does like kind of slap me back to reality that like people who apply they might not actually want to hang around and achieve like loads of goals they might just do it to go do their own thing the lover stone this this always feels the comforts love all skills improve faster if all skills improve faster than sure call me the lover stone who would put that on social me out wow wow you know that really happened um they applied their application and i pretty much checked out everyone's stream um uh after they applied just to see what they were putting out there because um there was a very notable trend of people applying and then all of a sudden their stream uh consistency ramped up because they were getting assessed and they were aware they were getting assessed uh i don't think i didn't notice that if you were one of those girls um uh there was also stream variety came out nowhere some people were very glued to one type of game zero um um and all of a sudden they start doing a variety of games kind of showing that they can uh play a different among the games um but yes um i did get to experience someone who openly admitted that they basically applied but couldn't care less about the actual longevity of violour and it is quite scary to think that there's a possibility that even through my vetting process um there is a team who also assessed uh the girls that get in as well um and maybe at a later date i can maybe speak a bit more about it i think now is a bit too sensitive of a time because obviously it's only been one week excuse me sorry just dealing with this guy uh he is a very bad man do not trust him are you good oh good thank you here well what do we get i think we get a gold band from or something uh why were they after you no um does that affect your judgment what does what affect my judgment i'm so sorry you're gonna have to go over that again i'm sorry i completely forget uh what my like previous sense was azure's voice was too perfect for the character yes i i did admit that if azura did not accept uh i was essentially up shit creek because everyone who applied i was not satisfied with their fit for the voice i did say though i said it before anyone's like that's not fair they were born that way they just got in uh what about rooting for the underdog okay you know fuck off um this agency isn't for fucking like sorry i do get a bit passionate about like fuck off mom you never fucking cheered for the underdog in your life like sharp it's you and zeal you idiot i i'm sorry i just choked on my bullet i'm getting a bit too uppity ah sorry that really hurt oh how can i help you sorry persistent aren't you oh very well oh am i to stand in the way by gen three stroney stroney's gonna need to recruit reefland spies to be in the applications inner circle honestly i love seeing you get passionate about it all oh it's it's honestly fascinating stuff to be behind the scenes um i absolutely wait what okay what i have been the artifacts i've discovered in the shun zeal wait one day i've only then you i'm calling it cal so sorry i'm just freaking you must be mad to think i while being an admirer i'm sure you can i'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing very well uh whatever and uh we did give us a key so i think we can just go for it can each of us reincarnate into another model jimmy for those who apply we the dwemer museum isn't open to anyone uh because cal you have a problem with that go talk to him i have a problem with it all i don't have freaking out okay hold on a little to the left oh oh oh now everyone knows i suck at luck girl hold on you stop shaking at me yeah that's what i thought don't talk to me don't talk to me bro all right uh i don't think we can sneak through here i think they attacked me stop it right there uh i'd rather die than go to prison fucking hell this is a bit dramatic but i think we're doing it uh oh i missed i missed i missed sorry i'm sorry sorry about that oh chat oh i missed again right see this freaking straight when you do the stamina effect did you go and stab him in the back like

uh it's barred from the other side so i was going the right freaking way uh right okay let's try again okay i'm sure i can figure it out when i get there i feel like a some secret offer no these are these are living quarters you're the stealthiest thief ever strong and no one will see you if they're dead exactly i don't know why that's still going because i pulled a lever uh i think i did it on the other side of the poison uh i guess if you wanted to be stealth you could just go through the poison but we'll just go for it we're going we're going we're going i'm being a dome dome okay turn that off right there so it's quiet and then up the stairs literally they were right there and i walked away from them it's just feeling quirky okay just feeling misunderstood oh just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen it's okay just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen it's okay it's okay just let it happen Mmm, big potatoes. Just, oh, 20. Enchanting! That's good. That would be like enchanting up in here. Just let it happen. Okay, we don't really need to... Oh, the box! We need that. Mmm, is this the barred door? It was! Okay, we've now got the shark cut up. So what's this? It's a chest. Ah, and then what's that? That's just the other side of the map. Oh my god, we did it. It's not war crime. It's just a cute girl. Me committing war crimes? Stop, you're making me laugh. Oh my gosh, I'm so turned around. It's been so long since I've done this. It's called Barbarian Stealth. Honestly, I actually really like that description for my thingy. I've always tried to do... What the heck? Jump shot. Oh, right. Wait, what? Where's the... There's a tic-tac to leave there. I don't think there's any enemies until they come in. We just need to pick up some charcoal and a piece of paper, steal the paper, steal the charcoal. It took me so long to figure out this area. Heavy armor increased to 16. It wasn't really worth the level up, but hey, we did it. I'm going to break some... Break it down now. Oh, look at that. Look at that. We do have a bow and arrow. Fire damage? Soul trap? Maybe... No, maybe not a soul trap on us. I would say fire damage. Take a little burn. Now, what pet are your... Bubbish. You know Seagrog method of stealth, honestly. Look, if it works, is there... Is there truly a point? Is there truly a point? Right, so the enemies do come in here. Obviously, because we are playing on legendary mode, and I'm just so MLG pro. Excuse me. We're just going to one-shot them, confidently. We are just going to one-shot them, confidently. We are just going to one-shot them. Nice and confidently. No problems. Acutely commits crimes against humans, honestly. Have you played Ghost of Toshima? I haven't. One shot, 100%. Return to the guy. Where's the guy? Is he in here? Oh, return to the guy guy. Return to the guy. Walk on. Why the heck does it make me go backwards? It says games, but... The mapping is a bit rough. Can I loot this account? They're so good. Wait, are the guards going to attack me? Are the Marker of Guards going to attack me? I'll pick them out. I come back and see you're still in- Eh, no! I'm sorry but these accusations are unfounded. I'm not a novice, I'm a legendary, clearly. Look, I'm sorry to your untrained eye, but when you get really good at the game, it just makes things- Why did it do that? Why did you do that? Why does the game do that? Honestly, I could fart on it something. Yeah, just- It's because I'm such a high-skilled level, it makes it appear to be a very easy level. So please don't worry about it. No, okay. The mages don't let us go into the hall. The mages don't let us go into the hall. I've played this game for two- Eh, how dare you? Why is the child in the basement? Right, here's the translations, bro. I'm rubbing, eh? When you're amazing, you make everything look easy. Yeah, legendary keyboard. See how that's not valued at 50? It's not going to teach you nothing. Don't open that book. Maybe sometime you should judge a bit, but cover. It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the guild for months. Mercer Frey is the baddie! Dun, dun, dun! A very lavish lifestyle, replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures. That's actually my specialty. And yes, Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge. Anything else, Enzo? Anything about the Nightingales? The Nightingales! The last few pages seem to describe the failure of the Nightingales, although it doesn't go into great detail. Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher. Shadows preserve us, so it's true. She bald under that hood! She's not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher, but what is it? What's Mercer Frey done? The Annoying Hunt is actually the bad guy. I'm shocked! Color of me surprised. The gold and right in standards by the dev team. What's called express. Bald! It always annoyed me. When you put on a hood, your hair gets removed and it annoys me so much. It's just such a... Get away from me! Excuse you, anyone talking to you? Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the guild. They respected Carlyer and she deserves better. Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favor. Sure! Thank you! You ever managed to gain entry to the college and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods? He's a fan! I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time. Questionable interest or like that. You must hasten to rift in before Mercer can do any more. You must hasten to rift in! You've come this far, so I see no harm in conceiving it any longer. Bald gen two member confirmed! No! No! Say it ain't so! I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home! Oh my god, members karaoke, I can absolutely wreck my voice on that. I can get beer! I can get beer! And we can do membership karaoke! And I can do song requests, like you guys put it together, oh I'm pretty good. And drink to your family, drink it with your friends, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Beer they only drink is made for you, you'll drink till you spew, ew! Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. Carla currently and kindly explaining the nightingale lore in her relationship to Gaelas, whilst I sing that one beer parody song that had that Lego animation. Why are you in the basement child? I'm getting, I'm getting weirded out. Get, just leave me alone! Get away! Creepy wee thing, honestly. And you sing Flare of Scotland, no I have to be hate music, I'm not singing, I'm not getting drunk and going Oh, Flare of Scotland, when will we see our life again? Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. I don't know why national songs insist on going so high. Like, they, can't you not just, give me one song where like the decibels, the decibels, like the notes in it are just like really common and everyone can sing it. Donald, where are your choosers? What's that song? I think I've ever heard of it. I missed beer whilst I was grabbing a drink. No, no, no, we're gonna do like drunk membership thingy. Back to where I am. Petra also bad poops in. I'm ready, let's go. I was gonna force us to sing Christmas carols on Christmas. I like A Wee and a Manger. A Wee and a Manger. No crib for a pit. Why does it go so high pitch? Why can't they not just have a song that's like down here? No crib for a bed. The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. The cattle are lowing. Oh yeah, I was gonna force you guys to do like freaking Christmas songs with me and then we watch Lord of the Rings on Christmas. Let the winds blow high, let the winds blow to the streets and my cattle go. Although as you say, oh Donald, where are you? What the frick, I've never heard that. Do your tit-sangle, do they wobble to the floor? I can't say that, I'm sorry. I'm getting a bit, I'm getting a bit delirious, hold on a minute. You've never heard that song before? I've never heard that song before. Now what's this song called? I've got a sister. She's not even drunk yet. Just talking about alcohol is getting me steaming. It's making me lose the plot. Let me see. No, it can't be. No, it can't be. What's that mean? I've known Mercer too long. He quoted the main. The floor? Yeah, it's a bit dark. We're currently in the sewers. Right under your nose. Do they wobble to the floor? Can you tie them in the knot? Can you tie them in a bow? My kami oshii hates Mongolian throat singing. It's because cats don't like the sound of that vibration that Mongolian throat singing provides. So thus, I don't like it. I don't like vibrations. That rrrrrrrrr. No, bad. Cats don't like it. It makes their ears go back. So it makes my ears go back. The world's greatest thieves live in a sewer. Down in the sewer. Ever listen to the nasty shrank licks? Let's go. The memer is starting to break free. I want to break free. My cat licks it. Your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing and I will not be taking any further statements. I assure you, your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing. Base cat. Absolutely not. Are you sure about that? Rip project when my OSD fans and shambles due to the Mongolian throat singing hate. Me, my life away. I was so hard to sing that. Any song is hard to sing. My voice is so frazzled. I'm just a memer. I mean my life away. Sorry, the thieves gold are now just revealing that Mercer has betrayed them for many years and there's not a penny left for them. I mean my life away. Away. Why is camera the frog in the stream? Crematy frog here. I would like to do some karaoke. Sing your cover live. He also like rock music. We doubt you don't like vibrations. I've got an even funner fact. I only like it. Yes, yes, yes. I killed Gallus, not Carly. Gallus, Carly and Mercer were Nightingales. Carly was behind Golden Glow and Honeybrook. Say it. The magic button cannot handle the vibration. But the dirt road home can. Oh I have permission. Okay infiltrate Mercer's home. Oh everyone's on alert. Alert, alert, Mercer. Alert, alert. Oh I bet we are but you should be here. I don't doubt for one second. I won't remember that. Please continue. Information stored and saved. Yeah, literally there's no doubt about it. The tales get it back. I didn't realise how fake speedish that all the voice actors accent try to mimic. It's actually quite jarring. Be careful. What are you talking about? Hello, hello. This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away. I need to get inside Mercer's house please. No visitors, no way. Now piss off before you make me mad. I'll make it worth your while. You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away. Unless you can talk to Maven Blackbriar and let me out of my debt. Okay. Try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off. Fine, I'll go talk to Maven about big, big, big stinky, what's your name? Bald, more like cold because it's freezing outside and you're not wearing any outfit. Oh, absolutely rolled and decked. Hello, America Hiya. No, no, no, American. Wednesday is her birthday. I believe it's the 23rd of August if I'm not mistaken. All the crime and corruption in Riften is really getting to him. And now that we hear rumors about the dragon. Is she not up? Where is she? You have some nerve coming back here after what you did to Kirado. He less of a shake. Where's Maria? Okay, hold on. If I put that on, it should show more. Oh, she is here. You were there all along. I presume you're bothering me for a while. Why would you want to help that idiot? He owes me a steep debt. In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work. If he don't want any of it, I'll take a bell for me. What did he do? A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of mine in Winterhold. Do you think Mercer is a claw? He's in debt because of a quill? Is this his quill that's in the freaking lake? Oh, it's... Oh, no. I think it might just be easier to perish this man. I think it's in a boat. Oh, goodness me. It's been many a year. I think it's in a boat. I'm gonna have to look at it on the HUD. Hold on. I want to say it's like somewhere here. To the left. Oh, I could be terribly wrong though, but there should be a boat. It started... It's at the bottom of the lake somewhere. Thank you for your help, Brief. No, I really appreciate that. I am somewhere at the bottom of the lake. I don't even have water breathing either. I can't believe you. You had the audacity to take that out. You're just trying to upset me. What's this? What's that barnacles? I'm already... Oh, my... Oh, wait, wait, wait. Is this a hint? Is this a hint? Hold on, let me breathe. Is this a hint that maybe you were around here somewhere? Hold on. Right. Should we... Oh, no. Right, well, there was a box, but I guess not. There's rocks here. Is that telling me it's here somewhere? Got that barnacles. There's more barnacles. Oh, can you just, like, render distance, please? Stronius. Under the water. You don't want reflins! Ah, let me breathe. I seem to think it's, like, the left side. I saw that storage box. I think that's the game being, like, hint. It's over here. Okay, hold on. Let me just check again. I think it's in a broken boat. It's on the map somewhere str- Right, I'm not reading chat for the next minute. You're on time out. You're done. I seem to think it's close to the edge of the water. Wait, oh, this is a bit too close, clearly. By the bridge? I don't recall it being by a bridge, to be honest. You know what, reflin? What? Stronius, what do you think of the Indiana Jones game? I didn't know there was a new one! Aw, for goodness' sake. I think I'm off the mark. Where am I? Maybe it's, like, down here a bit. I mean, this is the entire area. Okay, I'm just gonna do one big glipper on the island. Why is there so many salmon? Stronius, I love you. Don't hate my friends. Wait, why would I hate your friends? I thought you weren't looking at us. Look, I forgive really easily. Oh no, get up! Shabee, what are you doing? Underwater burning. Drowning. Okay, I don't think it's up this way, but we're gonna just do a big circle for the sake of satisfying myself. Come up for water often. Reeflands, remember that Stronius is as much of an addict as we are. Scuba, Shabee. Shabee, making me nervous. Oh, wait, it may be on one of these islands. It may be rocked up on a baby island. Do you know that? What the heck was that? I'm rabbit! Hold on, let's just check the hut again. Right, we're kind of at the furthest point of this section of the lake. I'm not really wanting to go too much further. It's near the box you found before. Oh my god, I'm actually getting my hand held. See, thank you, Reefling. I actually get my hand held. I knew it was freaking back there. I've gone way off course. Oh my god, I forgive. Fucking Moncaius. It's between the big island and Riften. That's it, I'm giving in. Skyrimmer's been installed. Are you happy now? Oh, have I put you in the Skyrim mid? Yippee! I can't help the sarcasm. I forget where the thing is every time in Wastehaven I was looking. Also, it's underwater, not on an island. Yeah, it's like crashed off of it. My eyes are currently burning, opening under the salt water. Alright, I'm gonna swim. Alright, that's not it. These are just textures. It's not like this, I can't even swim in. So there's no point. I'm gonna go buy that box again. If I could find the box again. We'll float to the right this time, not to be confused with the hit TV game. A little to the left. I don't know why I said TV game. Steam game. So those were the barnacles. I'm getting swept up. We're trying to find the quill. That maven. I did not realise how rubbish this game is. Is this for real? There's like two floating foxes under the camp. What's going on here? I can see loads of broken stuff. Hold on, let me breathe again. Alright. Definitely not searchable. There's like loads of boxes just hanging off the dock. It just works. I think you may have floated over it. It's not by the docks. Oops. I like the detail though, the concept that like it fell off the boat and they can't retrieve it. It's quite smart. This is where I'm on the map. I'm like messing around here. Isn't this rock formation maybe? What the barnacles? Hold on, let me breathe. I'm like right... I'm like freaking... I'm here. I doubt it got dropped here. It just seems so unlikely. Go straight from the docks towards the island. Okay. I'm searching. I'm searching. There's salmon. There's salmon. There's box. There's box. But it's more towards here. Oh, let me breathe. Hold on. Okay. Okay, this is new. I don't think we've investigated this. Maybe we have. I have a freaking potion of water breathing that would make this a lot easier. Water breathing? Where? Water breathing! Oh, hold 15 seconds. Oh, you're too kind. You're too kind. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Fucking... Oh, I'm getting current. I'm getting drafted away by the current. Okay, fuck that. Right, we're doing new one. Stop! Current, stop! I can't breathe. Oh! Ah! I've only got 10 lock picks. Gonna be easy on me. I'm gonna need to buy some more. No! Less? I'm like... Is that less or is that more? Oh! Gimme that! Stupid bastard! You're a quill. Right. We did it. Oh my god, that took a while. Just get Volsang and forget about that. What's Volsang? She's got it. If she can open the box, literally. What's inside the box? That fucking quill! You did it. You're the first person in history to buy lock picks. They're so common. I don't want to keep forgetting to fill it. Hi, do you want a quill? I found the quill. Yes. Okay. Oh, okay. Oh, that's Exile. That's not very nice. He's made his pals here. Do you want to reconsider Exile on someone? That's not very... That's not very nice. Have you heard of that? Have you heard how damaging that can be to someone's social life? Makes them feel like they're not a part of the community. Have to, you know, uproot and go elsewhere. Not nice. It's trying to suck at this guy room. I know. Eh, you. Come... Come here. I can't talk to him yet or he'll be aggressive. Like... You. Psst. Psst. Psst. Psst. Here. Over here. What? What? Or Big Vault. Sorry. Big Vault. Oh, oh, he's going to that gate. Hold on. If we're fast enough, if we're fast enough, we can go. We can go talk to him on the other side of that gate. Vault. Vault. Hold on. Vault. It's me. It's me. No, no, no. He's come back to the original position. No, Vault. Wait, Vault. Wait. Let me talk to you. I just want to talk to you. I just want to talk to you. I just want to talk to you. I just want to talk to you. Vault. Vault. Oh. I have something for you. Here. It's your debt with Maven. You're free. What are you doing? How's he added? Are you just coming out now? Oh, he is. Oh. Can't talk. I'm out of here. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Can I just come in this way? Oh, it's barred. Wait. I need a bow and arrow. Or can I just hit this? Okay. No. You need a bow and arrow. I was being a bit... Let me just... Oh. Ta-da. That's how you get the ramp down. Super fuss. He's skipping tone. No reason. I just subbed to all the girls' accounts. Heck yeah, dude. We love supporting gen-mates out here. Oh, the whole linear. You animal. Literally finishing off the kill. She said, nah, I want to be the reason for death on the death certificate. Jeez, Louise girl. The bar is locked in place and cannot be opened. Okay. Any money? Garnet, I'll take you. I can sell it for some money. Statue of Debalah. How about that? Can I move that one? Nope. Can't move that one either. Okay. What's in this house then, I guess? Let's go F myself. Wait. What? This isn't the end. Hold on. Right here? Ah. Yeah. Right, I'm not touching anything else. Suspicious clothes. Honestly, I wouldn't have figured that out more. If we ended up a little cheeky here in the portion. What's this? I have no idea what this is. That looks like a trap. Lydia. Lydia. Lydia, stop standing on stuff, Lydia. Lydia. Lydia. I'm getting sliced in days. Hold on. I'm getting absolutely chopped up. Oh, and there's poison doors. Mine. Goodness. You need to relax. Oh my God. Money. Okay, I've got that. What's this? Eh. What even? What is this book? I have curiosity. What's the contents of this book? I've never actually written it. Lift her tail. Certainly not, kind sir. I am here to clean your chambers. Is that all you have come? Is that all you have come here for? Little one, my chambers. I have no idea what it is you imply, master. I am but a poor Argonian maid. Bro, what? So you are my dumpling. And a good one at that. Such strong legs and shapely tail. You embarrass me, sir. Fear not, you're safe with me. I must finish my cleaning, sir. The mistress will have my head if I do not. Cleaning, eh? I have something for you right here. Polish my spear. But it is huge. It could take me all night. Plenty of time. My sweet plenty. I've never fucking read that. Oh my god, that's hilarious. Many thanks. Not certain how you managed to get your hands on this item we discussed, but I'm more than pleased. I thought you'd simply wait until transported to Castle Diver to its final destination but according to what I've heard, it vanished right from their armory. I wish I knew how you were able to slip by the guards, bypass the porticolas, unlock the armory door and break in at the door of a puzzle-locked chest. You need to teach me that little trick sometime. I've left your cut in the usual drop spot and might have another drop where you soon are. There's three more books of it. Oh my god, but I've never... I knew the books existed. Wait, what am I doing? Expert! Can we do it? Okay, but we have it. Easy. Easy. Okay, a bit more, I think. Or maybe it was left, I don't know. Okay, maybe it's left, you know that. Easy. Easy, I'm getting nervous. Easy. Alright, we got childrens. I'll take childrens. Not a bother at all. Not a bother at all. The rat weevils, yes. Let's go. Let's go. I don't remember what way to go. Is it this one? Oh no, this is if you want Dragonborn. Can you stop attacking me? Whoa, your bull! It's an imperial bull. I think an imperial bull is better than what I've got right now. Although mine does have burn damage, so... I wish YouTube had other emotes, I know. YouTube is like very slowly catching up to the appeal of... I'm not doing any more lockpicking, I don't know. YouTube is very slowly catching up to what the appeal of Twitch is. To the point where it is going to take over Twitch, I'm sorry. It just is. Why did I drop down? I've just added so much time to this travel. I did not recall how long it takes to place Skyrim. We're literally not even finished one questline yet. Tear him up, Lydia! Okay, there we go. Emm... Emmys rats! I'm so confused, where did that come from? I dropped down there. Okay. Ugh, there you go. Channel emotes soon, channel emotes literally less than 24 hours, have fun. Am I almost supposed to speak to Brinyo? You know what, if I had that selected, that probably would have gone a lot faster than what I just did there. Underestimating the 1000 plus hours game, but literally I was like, right, we'll do the Thieves Guild, we'll do Dark Brotherhood. We're literally six hours into this stream, I've less than six hours and I've not even finished Thieves. Oh, sorry, sorry. I got a bit excited there, I apologize. Okay, let's do that. How much? How many? How much heavy am I? Curry, wait, it's 2, 18 out of 3, 30. That'll do, I need like 100 stuff. Hi, Carlaya. How long do we have? Yeah, less than six hours because of this. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, the wise two people inviting me to talk, there's too many people. Wait, so do you do every sequel? No. I was just going to do Thieves Guild, Black, Assassins, what, that's not what they're called. The Dark Brotherhood, and then the Vampire, and then the main quest, and I've done nothing yet, so I don't think it's happening. Dark Brotherhood, yes. Hi, Brainyo, smashes into wall. The trinity of streams on YouTube, YouTube shorts and recycled clips with 10 minutes highlights on the same platform. And also just a cheat for exposure. Yeah, like Twitch is exposed, it's very interesting to see breakdowns on either website. Like, I've just... Meet Carlaya at the Sanding Zone. Okay, we're about to become a nightingale. I know I've literally skipped through all the dialogue, so for anyone who hasn't consumed Skyrim and is listening in at home, I apologize greatly. I can just give you the TLDR, more than happy to provide such a thing for you. How the heck do I get out of this area? I'll just go out of the docks, how about that? I don't think you can jump over. If you haven't played Skyrim, go play Skyrim. Mind yourself. I'd be a rifting guard, I'd be like, yeah. Don't be causing trouble. Hi, Maul. Any news involving the Dark Brotherhood? Oh, that's the other... that's the Brotherhood quest. Well, that was lucky we talked to him to get that, because we'd probably just have to kill Grelok the kind. And she's actually not very kind. What's this? Oh, it's a clay deposit. The T-Skilled quest line is mostly yapping at this point. Honestly, we're about to become nightingales, and it's about to be yap-yap-yap-yap-yap. I thought I was a good yapper. Yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap. Hello, hello! I'm glad you're here. What's the significance of this place? This is the headquarters of the nightingales. Cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind. See? We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey. Okay, yeah. What kind of an edge? What kind of an edge? If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way. Yeah. Yeah, let's edge this way, please. Oh, look at them steps. Look at that bow, though. I actually want that bow. Look at the satchel that the arrow's going. I like how they're coded to look like what the arrow is. Very nice. Very, very nice. I heard about this place when I joined the gale, but I never believed it existed. I never believed it existed? I took enough and I'm back. Are you surprised I'm still on? Um, is Emi's room in today? Emi? Or is it? No, Emi should already be on. Azura should be coming online in two minutes. If I have my times correct. Emi's off today. Just Sheevee and Mersey. So Mersey's on at one. Right. We'll redirect into Mersey. Deal? I'll make you a deal. We'll redirect into Mersey. Yeah, but we're in the nightingales like Robin Hood or something? I, the first time I did this, like the nightingale quest, I was in love with Lady Luck. I absolutely just... Ow, that was very loud in my ear. Hopefully that wasn't too loud in your ear. I just absolutely and truly adored the like, plot. Oh, I like so cool. I just look so amazing and awesome. Everything. I am ready for the oath. Now you go get changed. Best looking armor in the game. Honestly, this armor and Dark Brotherhood armor. Yeah, that's awesome. I think we should trust the lass and take the deal. I may have misheard you, but Mersey is in three hours. No one. Yeah, no, Mersey comes online at one o'clock for me. One o'clock in the afternoon, yeah? That's when Mersey comes online for me. So Mersey's actually perfect for us. Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a nightingale. Whoa, that lass. I appreciate the armor. But becoming a nightingale? That was never discussed. To hold any oath of defeating Mersey, we must have Nocturnal at our backs. If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck. So dramatic. What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms. What time did I start streaming? Oh, I started streaming, yeah? At 4 a.m., yeah? I started at 4 a.m. I started at 4 a.m. You never wondered why everyone's schedule has a cheeky time zone that no one uses? Because that's my time zone. If it means the end of Mersey Frey, you can count on those night hours. Yeah. Are you ready to transact the oath? Yes, I will become nightingale. Yes, I'm ready. Please stand on the western circle. Holy crap, 4 a.m. The reason why I stream so early is in case I need to do stuff during the day. Originally, it was either I stream at 4 a.m. or I stream at 10 a.m. But the problem is, if I stream at 10 a.m., the day is over by the time I finish my endurance streams. So I wouldn't be able to do doctor's appointments if I need to make an appointment. Lydia, you're going to ruin this so much. Please stand elsewhere. Or just go... Lydia, you're going to ruin this scene so much. I'm not being funny. Come here, Lydia. You're going to ruin the awesomeness of this scene. Lydia. Wait here. Thank you. There's such a beautiful cinematic coming up and they don't know what it is yet. Just let it happen. Oh, not Lydia standing in the corner, right? Just don't look at her. Don't acknowledge her, okay? She's like a dinosaur. Alright, let's enjoy this because this is actually pretty cool. What could you possibly offer me now? I have two others that wish to transact the earth to serve you both in life and in death. You surprise me, Caroline. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor. In my favor? My appetite for mercy tomorrow succeeds my craving for wealth and grace. Revenge. How interesting. Very well. The conditions are acceptable. You may proceed. Lady Nocturne, we accept your terms. I ain't saying none of this. She sells to you as both your avengers and your sentinels. We will honor our agreement in this life and the next until the conditions have been met. Very well. I name your entrance night and day and I restore your status to the same, Caroline. And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain from disappointing me. Wait, we don't get to see her? I didn't see her. Okay, normal. I thought we got to see her. I guess it's with the next cinematic. I don't know. What do you mean we? It's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you. Mercy's true crime. Well, he's done more. Mercy was able to unlock the guilt vault without two keys because of what he stole from the twilight sepulchre. That's Scaly key. By doing this, he's compromised our time to return and in essence caused our luck to run dry. So the key doesn't lock any doors. But the key isn't only restricted to physical barriers. All of us possess untapped abilities. The potential to upgrade power is securely sealed within our minds. Once you realize the key can access these traits, the potential becomes limitless. The three sounds like no one should possess it. Good. Then you understand why this is a... It's too much power for one human to have. If the key isn't returned to its lock in the twilight sepulchre... We see her when we return the key. Yes, we will do that. As time passed, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade. First time I've ever set out to return something? In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner. Let's go then. Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you listen to him. All right, big Bryny. What's up? Listen, lass. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer. Uh-huh. The leadership of the guild. Oh my god, he's tapping his way through. Oh, he's doing a wee Irish dance for us. Oh, did-did-did-did-did-did-did. I and I had a long discussion before you arrived here. Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal with him, all that remains is restoring the guild to its full strength. Wovens, have you used the skeleton key on someone's torso? What kind of question is that? I'll be back soon to have fun, yeah. Don't worry if you guys need to leave at any point. I'll be-I'll be at it. He is. He's tapping away there. Mm-hmm. Sorry, I'm trying to focus on your words, but your foot is moving and it's making me laugh. It's about time. No, it's not right. I don't know what to say. So don't get sentimental on me now, except... We'll handle the details. Ooh. We have quite the task ahead. Ah! Then let's get to it. What if we try to use the key on Strani? And implying you don't have free reign of me? Refling. You know me better than that. Yeah. Right. Lydia, I'm sorry that I put you in exile. Yes, follow me. My thing. I can't believe I made myself Lydia 2.0. Strani using the key on Refling? It's funny, you think you have any resistance against me. Roy is regaining his own foot in the way he tapped him. Sure. Oh yeah, becoming Guildmaster is bugged if you don't do the radiant quest first. Oh, I've always managed to do them after. I don't even know how they... Where the heck do you expect me to go? Eh, let's do that then. Strani considering you don't have many lockpicks, it may be beneficial just to hold on to it for a while. For a while, honestly though. Right, I need to go a little to the left. Not to be confused with the hit steam game. A little to the left. Let's get to it. If I can get up this hill then the enemies in that building won't be able to know me. Why would I resist Strani? Exactly, why would you? Anyone who puts up a fight gets... Twice as hard. Oh, hopefully you can figure out what the substitute was for that word. That's terrible. Wait, that's north. I'm going the wrong way. No, it's like along the waterfront. I would just... What? Sounds good. Hi, Strani. Dang, you're going hard into this game. We haven't even finished one questline yet. It's officially been six hours and I haven't finished one questline. I completely forgot how just humongous what this game is. It's extraordinary that I haven't actually... I'm about to get close to finishing the thieves. But even then, I'm not even going to truly finish them due to the reason of what. Because we're not even going to do those miscellaneous quests for the Thieves Guild to restore it to its final glory. Because... Do I take the lift here? No, I still don't take the lift. Keep the skeleton key for yourself. No, I'll be a good girl because I want to see a mummy nocturnal. I really like her design. I wouldn't mind incorporating... Well, I wouldn't mind. It's a very good design. Okay, the phone goes the same. How the heck did I get where I'm going? Literally every time I have to go somewhere, I just start spamming E on a hill and I'm like, is this where I'm supposed to go? No, I don't really have to walk up the hill yet. No, I don't have to walk up the hill. It's fine. It's fine. I saw that orbing. Now I'm not sure if I should resist or not. Either way, the outcome is clear. The hor... Oh, I thought it was the wind. It was rules. You don't need the key when you get a log pick into a hundred. Oh, I didn't know that. Does everything just become easy piece of lemon squeezy? Or do the log picks not break on a hundred or something? We're getting there. We can do it. I'm leaving us. We're just a little exhausted. I'm scarous. I thought for some reason, you said I'm scouse and I was like, right? Now what? Oh yeah, by the way, I'm scouse. I like the way you talk, Scottish lass. You know, right? Can I buy a cheeky Maccas? Wait, Maccas is Australian term. I can't believe it. We're boarding live here today. We are going to... This place is actually covered in bandits. I cannot for the life of me doing Australian accent. Who we are? Ray, what's this? A gate. Open the gate. Why not? That may come and help me with future... Go on a Maccas run, yeah? Get in void with me, yeah? Oh, I thought it was going to one shot you. I'm going to be honest. Yeah, you can beg for mercy when you're dead. Oh, I bonked him. Wait, give me that. I will destroy that. What is this? Can someone look this up? What I'm supposed to do with it? Flood, var, la, stone. I don't know what it is. Flood, var, la, stone. I've never seen them before. PC seems to have them. Xbox doesn't seem to have them. But mercy's in three hours. So you should have paid for that. Sorry, I got a lot. Go itch on my head. Speak to Carlaya. Ooh, they got... I... good luck. Egg's fair is a bit much. I've done that for souls. Right, the machines drop... Where's Lydia? Lydia, you do this all the time. There should be an enemy that pops out of here, yeah. Oh, that's right, I remember. These guys used to tweak me out. I'm actually... Tell you what, that was like really loud. I'm going to... Sentence, audio. Is that a bit better on your ears? I feel like whenever that happens, it's so loud. A new hand has touched the beak. Now, these do drop, yeah. That's exactly what I'm wanting. Like, tons of these soul gems. Oh, hold on. 246, we're getting there, we're getting there. Yes, oh my goodness, this is what we want. Like, massive amounts of these soul gems. And then we can put, like, really good stuff on. There should be one that pops out of here. Yeah. Oh, I'm getting too good. I'm genuinely too good at this game, I'm sorry. The fact that I remember from childhood, where the enemies, like, come out... I'm just gonna show you how scared I was with the enemies. Come here. Okay, there we go. What was that, three to scavenge? Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it. I'll take it, I'll take anything. I'm happy with anything, any offerings I'll take. Oh, yeah! Is the enemy from here? Here. Oh, I heard that! I heard them, like, spidering up here. I can hear an enemy. Oh, I heard two, just one in there. But I need to go here. They're so tiny! They're so tiny! Oh, we are getting so many soldiers. This is exactly what I was needing, one of the runs in here. That spawn sneak is actually impressive. Ah! There, them. Okay, we can destroy that. Yeah, let's go. Alchemy. Yeah, yeah, I'll take the potions, let's go. Oh my god, I just jumped in real life. Because of that noise, of that latch. Oh, hello. Those bandits back there. Dot, dot, dot. We have to catch up to him before it's too late. I had the brap lever, literally jumped scared of me. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us. Oh, he really got me there, didn't he? Look, there's so many, oh, soul gems. We love soul gems, soul gems, soul gems, soul gems. Oh, wait, is this the thing? I'm supposed to watch him, look, there he is. Look through the bars. I'm trying to, where is he? I'm pretty sure he pops out somewhere here. And this is a, this is an instance report. I've returned to continue watching. Where? Oh, there he is, there he is. That's Mercer, look, I'm crawling over. Look at this little cinematic. Oh, like, has he just expired right now? Oh, he didn't even move a sword. Eyelash, and we'll be ready for him. Man, FOV is so low. Do you get motion sickness? No. I'm very lucky, Mercer says she gets motion sickness playing video games. Not to be dramatic, but I think I would end it. Oh, God, I think there's farmer around here. What's this? Potions. Lutions and potions, I do love a good, I do love a good collection. Isn't there a farmer here? No? Empty? Oh, found him. Found him. Shit, and I have course of poison. What does he draw? Skibertail, nah, you're good. You, I want your soul gems. Who am I perishing? Why is Mercer such a poopy poopy? I just smacked myself into a wall at low health. Okay, that'll do. I think I'll be okay though. That was a jump scare and a half. Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine. Actually, it's probably really good that I have that on a panic, because it gets me away from the enemy really quickly. What the heck is this? Let's just stop. Oh, I need to go up. Excuse me? The freaking blades on the ground took all my expert! Are we having a troll? And where's the other lever? Excuse me, Brinyel, if you're just smacked me in the... That's the other lever there? Behind an egg spare? That can't be right. Surely not. But it is. That cannae be right, don't you have the skeleton key? No, we've not done that part. But that is it. Well, good thing I don't have a smurf it, but what? Wait. Oh, that's not the lever at all. Where the heck's the first lever? Is it here? Where's the second lever? Reveal yourself! What? There it is! Oh, it's adjacent to the other lever! Oh my god. Did I need to go all the way back again? Out my way, out my way, out my way, out my way. I'm not that fast. Hold on, hold on, I need to cheat. I'm not that fast. I was gonna say, putting something behind an expert level thing is wild. That wasn't it? Okay, I was gonna say, that has to be it. I refuse. A little cheeky chess. I'm being trolled by this game. I'm being through trolled. I'll destroy that, and then I can get more thingy. Are we there yet, bruv? I feel the same, we've literally not even finished one questline. I'm ready to make another cup of tea. Alright, you can stealth this area, but I'd rather just go for it. I'd rather just go for it. By the Pope, who's there? Identify yourself. There is a chess down below, but I'm not really fast right now. I want to finish one questline! One questline is all I have. Stop it, you're so stinky. Okay, hold on, you got something? Charmin's Key. What was this, a Charmin's Key, dude? Oh, is it for that? You know what, maybe this chest. No, it's not. Well, I'm not looting it then, go away. I don't know what the heck the Charmin's Key is for. Clap him, stinky lightning, honestly. How do you come back from that? Someone calls you stinky, you have no way of coming back, truly. It's over for you, just admit it. There's traps everywhere. Isn't there a massive Centaurian coming up? My brains just reminded me that there's a big enemy coming soon. What does that say? Bro, the game thinks I can read that? Mercer, it's backwards! Mercer is on the bottom. Why is that backwards? I can read Mercer as backwards. I don't mind the stinky. I don't mind the wires. What, an air? Why is it backwards? I'll take these scrolls because I can sell them for money. Let's go, let's go. This is very real. Oh, dear. Right, can you jump the Centaurian and not me, maybe? Oh, goodness, gravy. Some of these enemies are my right fellows. All my fellows. Oh, hold on. Hold on, right there you go. Alright, I should probably go to sleep. See you next time. Rest well, those who sleep. Please don't worry if you do need to go to sleep again. But the cheeky endurance stream, Mercer is going live in T-minus less than three hours. We're going to read Inter because my Skyrim escapades got cut short due to the fact that... Oh, I am moving so fast I am successfully avoiding all the traps laid out. Yes, I don't know why achievements aren't popping up. I'm literally using Xbox Game Pass right now, so it's kind of the... I'm not sure what the dealio is, but I'm quite happy just to play through the... Thingamabobber and tomorrow's monetization celebration. So I guess I can enjoy a more relaxed for my voice. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Get a rest. Oh, I'm low health. Oh, I'm low health. I'm about to get altered by a spider. Hold on. Okay, there we go. Go around to read it. Go around it to read it. Oh, is there like another room that makes a lot more sense if there was like something behind it? Maybe I just ignored it and chose to be confused. Oh, give me that. Oh, orcishbowl and ice. Oh, and alchemy. Resurrect and restore my energy. Alchemyxing like a creature. Give me them juicy soul gems. That's all I want. That's all I crave. I just want soul gems. Oh, why don't I get one of you? No. Okay, okay, okay. You guys don't need to perfectly follow me. You do realize that, right? But we can do this. And we completely missed them because we alerted the enemies to our location. Okay, there we go. Oh my God, he's beat. They're jumping me. I'm actually beating that. God, they have so much venom. So much venom. Don't mind if I do it. Well, on earth where they do it, she be. What have you been doing in your dungeon? These last words? Oh my God, that's brutal. Hold on. These last words. Nobody thought they were real, but I've seen them. The eyes of the snow elves. The dwarves thought they looked... The dwarves thought they took them from the Thammer, but they themselves were fooled. A statue built in secrecy by the slaves. The eyes burn into you, and I see them. Even the Seraphot escaped through the collapsing tunnel, but he'll never escape what we've seen. Men will never believe him, and he'll be driven mad by the knowledge that he'll never see them again. But I may yet see them again before I die. Wow, that was strange. Strawny's a soul gem addict. Literally, they're like the most OP leveling up system. I'm just gonna blast through this area because there's a massive flamethrower, I think, or something. How am I detected if I'm around the corner? Why are you going for me? He's right there! Literally, right in... Actually, I just remembered, Mercer drops are really good. Two-handed sword, and we already got children. Yeah, that's right. Spank that rat on the fire. Oh, that's cool. Oh, I'm getting... Yeah, okay, I was gonna say I'm getting blasted by this. We may yet to see Strawny's eyes before we die. I might need to heal. Or I might get away with it. Ooh, we've been... Oh, I got detected. I keep going like, alright, I'll finally go sneak, and then I get detected because I'm not paying attention. Touch this. Eat this. Fun fact, the Dwemer nailed and scrolls are not doors, but actually, a type of elf. Two-handed. He's in a drill wheel there. Exactly. Imagine not being a drill wheel there. I can't relate. I've tried so many times to be an archer, but I just can't do it. Like, especially when the enemy come up in your face and you've got a bow and arrow, it's like, bro, it wouldn't actually be so fero-fero. I think that actually does more damage to the mother. Wait, can I get them to deal with the enemies? Oh my god, that's so cool. I can like, go through here. Is there like a treasure chest or something? Or is this just like a... Hurry up. Wait, that symbol. That means there's loot here? I don't see no loot. Or does it just mean that the thief's guild was here? Okay. I'm so confused. I feel like there may have been something I missed, but hey ho. Alright, let's get to it. Everybody get to it, to it. Let's get this party started. Let's get this bonus. Departed. Mercer was here. Shield 100 is perfectly viable, thank you very much. Probably. What do they hold? So they just kind of hold a lot of like, mix and stuff. That's interesting. They were more into like, the alchemy side of things. Master lot? Right, I'm not bothering. So it's on your bike. Hydration check. Oh. Wow. Wow. Such a shit. Yeah, give me the key, Mercer. The water's rising. I don't believe you, no. Turtle gates me, my new friend leaking. Oh. Dun dun dun. The difference is, I still have honor. If anyone falls, it'll be you, Mercer. Nightingale. I can't remember if this is hard or not. Oh no, he got wallets. Oh, he's got blood drain. Oh my god. Where is he? I can just see the red doll. I'm chasing the red doll. There he is. I found him. I got him. He's got, whoa, he's got like, yeah, I'll take all that. Shit, give me everything. Oh, I'm carrying too much to be able to run. Oh, sorry, hold on. Sorry, excuse me, just need to drop a few things that I don't need. I don't need an embalming tool, I can show you that much. Don't need random chunks of ore, that's fine. A what? It looks like a ship. Is that a tap? Yeah, don't need all these random miscellaneous things, that's fine. Ingredients that could probably eat all the little ones and clear up some side space stuff, I guess. Unknown, unknown. Sorry guys, I know the cave is collapsing, it's very important. I have a little taste test of all these ingredients, I assure you. Food, yeah, sure, let's just freaking load up. Am I light yet? No, I'm not light yet, holy crap. Okay, right, what do we not need? That does say 26, not gonna lie. Oh, I forgot to... That one's better. I don't want to drop it though, I feel like I can sell it for decent money, honestly. I guess we'll just drop that shit. Orcishbowl, 11. Please don't really give me much money. Okay, so don't panic. I know the cave is literally... Oh, I know the cave is like perishing and it's falling with war, but don't panic guys, everything is okay, alright? You just have to let it fill. Oh, oh he hit the quaw. Oh, are you guys okay? Do you guys need to breathe? No? No, you don't need to breathe? Okay, you don't have to. If you look above the head of the elf, you'll notice those rocks look very suspiciously movable. That's because they are, you have a keen eye, refling, you have a keen eye. I'm strong enough to taste test all the new alchemy ingredients, literally like trying to like release some of the weight in my inventory, and I'm like, hmm, yes, hmm, this moth wings though, what a delicacy. You just have to wait, unfortunately you can't like swim upwards, it doesn't do it the way you want it to, so it's a bit awkward. But yeah. I remember the first place where I was trying to like swim through these pipes, I was like, yes, the pipes, the pipes will save me. But it should do one big collapse. There you go. Pick it long enough, honestly. And then you just gotta wait until it gets high enough to get up there. To shift the weight in my body eats 50 cheese wheels. We are aquatic. Let me see some tools. Stopping to release, yes sir. But as faster you get out of that cave, the easier the game. I have completely forgotten how much the NPCs love to talk to you. No. Five years. No, Carlisle. It's not simple. Sepucar, I've never said sepucar. Are you ready to take a pilgrimage together? We can serve nocturnal in other ways. As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing. Then we'd best get started. We don't need it back if a thief's going to keep order while you're away. And I can't bear to face nocturnal, I don't need to protect the king. I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone. Okay, we can do it alone. We're big boys and girls. Take this with you. Help within the walls of the sepucar. Oh, she gives me her bow. Oh. Okay, I'm actually hitting it. Sorry, last round. Okay, you can't talk to me. Ow, I just got blammed by that skull. I literally yanked the HP off me. Can we serve Strony in other ways? Absolutely. It depends what you're offering is to me. Aw, I've not even been a folk wreath yet. Actually, you know what? I need to destroy and enchant a few things to sell on. So I'm going to go do that now and it will free up a lot of inventory. Is Carlisle the same VA as Shadowheart? I cannot tell you that. I don't know. Well, there's gates such good reviews, though, that I'm really tempted to play it for the first time on stream, but I'm worried in case I'm so dumb I can't figure it out, but hopefully it's a full-proof game like anyone can just jump in on the fun. Right, this is what I want. Devouring, archery and potions. Everything else can be sold. You heard it here first. Did I even have a big gem? I do. Yes. Did I make it craft? Yes. That was bloody good shoe. That bloody good shoe. Right, where's that? So what? Just enchant random stuff now for the XP, I guess? Turn undead. Frost damage here, why not? Petty Soul Gem. Yeah, I'm just going to put Petty Soul Gem stuff on it. Uh-uh. And then I know I can sell everything in my inventory. God, look at the level up. It's so fast. The game is so forgiven. Just the noise. It's just constantly like... We'll put all of this stuff on and then we can get a pretty penny. Oh, we might be able to buy the home. We might be able to buy our home in Riften. And then we can have our little flower garden out in front. We can't get chickens though. Not yet. Baldur's Gate 3 is good and you can do whatever you want. It's not really wrong way of playing it. Baldur's Gate is really open and rewarding. I'm glad. Um... I can't figure it out. Also tells us, please backseat me. You'll be fine. Yeah, some folk really are so strongly like a little bit backseat gaming. I'm actually going to travel to Riften just to sell some stuff because my inventory is getting a bit too full. Now, as much as I like being full and, you know, a bandaid slapped on top Not like this. I would like to sell some weapons that are very heavy. I will keep children. I'll put it elsewhere. I don't want to sell that stuff. I'd rather keep it. I can sell, like, all of it, right? You're out of money. I will remember that. You can marry the butcher. He's not a butcher. He's a blacksmith. Those wires are really crossed on me. Please take some of my stuff that I don't need. Thanks. Appreciate it. Created potions are 1% more strong. Wait, no, actually, I'm going to keep the diamonds and stuff on me. The reason for that is because you can get, like, miscellaneous quests to ask for that basic stuff. How about you? Everything I've got on display, really. We're going to get rid of all this. This should really lighten the load. I don't want to sell that thing. Oh, I completely forgot I have, like, golders. That must be... Oh, he's not going to gold left. Oops. Oops, I'm giving away things for free. Oopsies. Oopsies, tee-hee. Little tee-hee moment. Right, we'll go Falkreath, and then we'll hit up Twilight's. I love her. Strangely, I will remember everything you said. Fair enough. I don't even know what to say half the time. I'm just here for a good time. Do you remember when we almost got our heads chopped off? Yeah, and I was taken over by bandits and burnt tickers. Tee-hee, not my problem. Tee-hee. Stony, ever dropped a bunch of jewelry in the shopping centre in Riften? Everyone starts fighting over stuff you drop, and, like, it literally terminates NPCs, and it's like, I've need them for quests. That's the one thing I could absolutely obliterate Skyrim for, is if a quest requires an NPC, do not let them be perishable. Do not let them expire. I am so sad. What the heck is... Oh, no! The wolves jumped these poor people, and the one wolf perished them both. Mmm. That's what you get for trying to execute an innocent dragonborn. Some of them are marchers, and some NPCs can't be perishable, but if they have a quest, I feel like they shouldn't be able to expire at all, because it's so annoying when you're trying to do it, and then it's like, oh, surprise, by the way. Oh, who are you? Hello. What's a milk drinker like you doing out here? Go home to your mother. Yeah, I'm starting to think we're getting, like, absolutely nothing done. We're pretty much looking at T-minus two hours. I've been live for almost seven hours. I've yet to finish the quest. Eh, right. Fault creases here. What the heck is that? Bro! You can not drop rocks on people's heads. I cannot tell you how inappropriate that is. Um... I am home with my mommy. We drink milk and tea up in this place, of course. Literally, how have I been at this for seven hours? I'm not completed one quest. Something's not adding up. I don't know. Like, I'm pretty sure the Skyrim World record is, like, two hours. Like, one hour and 52 minutes or something. Ridiculous, like that. And you're telling me in seven hours, near seven hours, I couldn't finish one quest line. Well, I need sleep. Good night. Thank you for hanging. No promises, I won't see you in my dreams. That's right. Get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish. Your only dream of a Scottish. The Highland Cows call you. Ooh, I don't want to walk over a grave. That's bad luck. That's a lot of graves. What's going on in full graves? I feel like that's probably a quest, cause... That's a lot. Scotland! Forever! Get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish. I think I need to do that. Someone did that where I was like, get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant. And it's like, dang, dang, dang. Like, really intense music. I want to do that, but like, get Scottish, get Scottish, get Scottish. We're almost there. We're almost there, we're almost there. We just got to run a little bit longer. Oh, there's castles and ruins. Did you know you can just straight up buy castles in Scotland? Fun fact, you can literally look up them online. Just type in Castle for sale in Scotland. I'm not even kidding. It's pretty intense and cool. And you can buy churches. It's a lot cheaper to live in a church. An ex-church, by the way. You can literally, it's like, churches for sale in Scotland. Yeah, just have a look. It's like, way cheaper. Johnny, have you heard of the Scott Wikipedia vandalism story? Yes! Oh, we should talk about it. Like, if you didn't know. So, Scots is basically slang. And we say things very phonetically. And someone... Whoa, wait, I didn't realise you were a bandit. Sorry. Time to go, buddy. And someone basically went, Oh, I'll just rewrite this in Scots. But he, like, wasn't Scottish. So he just wrote what he thought, like, Scottish folks said. And it was just complete gibberish. And he'd been doing it for ages and no one, like, caught him. Wasn't that it? He sent in Zillow to Scotland to find an affordable hoose, honestly. It's Gallus! Hello. Hello, Gallus. I visited Edinburgh. Let's go. I'd asked the same question. That's really funny. Stony's gonna buy a castle, move the wheeler team into it, then get Reeflands to serve them there. But could you imagine, though? Like, oh! You know what, you get out of this exchange? A servitude! How are you to blame? Where can I say no? Wait a minute, you're Gallus! I'm best pals with your girlfriend. How do you say I love you in Scottish? It's just I love you. Like, I love you, and then I love you. It's kind of, like, shoved together in fast. He's that adoring fan. Is he? By Azura, by Azura, by Azura. I did this for Nocturo. I did this for the honour of the guild. Carlaya helped me. Yes, your girlfriend's alive. Well, then she would have appeared here. Then take the key and right all the wrongs. When we put Stony as our cult leader, we could cut taxes and save money! Yay! We can be tax exempt together. Yippee! How can a spirit die? The Ebeneer? A bit of Ebeneer? Maintaining a historical site for tax breaks and profit? Yeah, and then we run like a massive B&B over. Oh my god. I'm afraid so. I'm weakening. And I can feel myself slipping away. The gears without restoration of my power I had to take. That's taken. You really want to mess with the IRS? That should be a song. You really want to mess with the IRS? I fought the law in the law one. Ray. Good luck, Gallus. Even though you don't have to do anything. I don't mind doing the hard work, right? Who needs a bashing? Who needs a bashing? Who's begging for the pagan? Because it's all happening at once. Let's go! I bet he do. Beat him up! Beat him up! Beat him up! Beat him up! Beat him up! Oh wow, they're actually kind of beef. They're actually a bit stronger than your average enemy. Hold on a minute. I don't like that. You, come here. No, I'm stuck on the stairs. Hold on. I'm stuck on... I'm stuck on... Ow! Ow! Stop! Swap to weapon, Ray! Stop to melee! Yes, there you go. Okay, there we go. Jeez, I lose. What is in you? Arrows? So, Jim! Alchemy. Totally not secret backtracking. I do love Skyrim for that. It's quite rather entertaining. Okay, they've got elven arrows on their persons, which is pretty... Oh, why are you so scary? I'm not gonna lie. Like, they're kind of messing me up now. Open our own velar colony? What? In the Scottish countryside with crops and feudal lordship for the grove? Bruh! Look, sometimes a sense of community is all you need if... Oh! Wait, I'm to stay in the dark. Right, if you stay in the dark, your health doesn't get... Well, wasn't he paying attention to that? Was he? Clearly, no. Yeah, you just need to stay in the dark so you don't get hurt in this section. It's not really too bad at all. I just can't see nothing in it at all. Oh! Just a wee bit of poison, just a few darts in my eyeballs. It's fine, it's fine. I can still see for the most part. Wish I wore my glasses. My lady! Hello! Oh, a bandit got all the way here. Hello, my lady! Please ignore the fact that I'm taking your offering. So fragmented, I don't need that. Uh, uh, behind here is two chains to pull. Gammy! Atlas! Where's Blossom? Where's Gammy? That's Gammy, the girl, and that's her dad, Atlas. And Blossom's her mummy. Hmm. Is it true if you buy land in Skull, you become a lord? No, that is completely false. Um, if you take that in, by the way, you'll actually... Um... I knew... Ow! Oh my god, I just got reeled by a log. That wasn't really that fun, I'm gonna be honest. Wait, we did it, we did it. We're here, we're here. Snowberry's waiting on Icey's every need, Penpal's being picked for a set of me. Oh, it's all spooky, it's all spooky and purple. Oh, I love the color scheme. Oh, I remember this. Oh no, I'm stuck. I should read his note. Anderson's... Anderson's message. I don't think he made it, chief. I don't think he made it. Yeah. Uh... If only we had some sort of... Key? Some sort of skeleton... Key? Yep. Oh, I'm stuck. I got... Oh, that's... Gammies! Look at all Gammie's babies! Oh, I'm in the wrong way. Sorry, Hen. Tell me that ain't good design. Excuse me, we'll stay a little around. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement. We must stay focused, Reeflings. We must stay focused. Oh no. Wow! Drink? Bye-bye, mommy! Bye-bye, mommy! Where did you come from? Hello. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. Can I talk to you now? Yes. Uh, please, she sounded indifferent. What's this about becoming an agent and a nocturnal? What? Present moon? I think is what we want. A full moon for the agent of strife. This is nocturnal's role in maintaining balance. How is this goddess of stealth when it's clear? Ha! The clap of her cheeks would alarm the guards on a 500 meter radius. It's unfamiliar. Her hotness is so powerful. And you? Aw. The beginning of what? Wow. They're not good at what we do. Uh, I think stealth. Tell me about the present, then. Yeah, okay. Well, you do the agent of... Are you a crescent moon? You're a full moon. And you're a half moon. Okay, crescent moon. Hee-hee. Okay, now what? Oh, no. Gallus is about to come... Ooh, look, it's Gallus and Karnaya. They're gonna kiss. Come like the others. If it were not for the actions of this knight in the air, what the years would have come through. She would have just lost all of it. You do now, my love. Nocturnal calls me to the Everglow. My contract has been fulfilled. When I ever see you again. When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace what's there. Aww. I've been 25 years since you've seen each other, and this is it. This is what they muster. Are you alright, Karnaya? Maybe it's just not... It shouldn't understand. Oh, he's going to disappear into the bowl of soup. Oh, he's in the bowl of soup, lads. Sorry, I'm sure it's really emotional. Where did Gallus go in a bowl of soup? The spirit becomes one with the Everglow. Ah. So he's gone? Okay. You drank the ghost soup, honestly. They're a part of the darkness around us? Oh, they're so cool. Oh, I'm getting it now. How will I know if I'm needed here? Okay. Use it whenever you wish. Okay. Where will you be? I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there. Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities too. The quiet thing is from time to time. Can't afford to get rusty now, can we? Well, I'm... I'm satisfied. Yeah, yeah, bye-bye. Okay, thank you. Thank you, hubby-bee. Is this your home now? It is! Okay, so she just hangs out here now. Girl, that's a bit depressive. But anyway, that's all new. As long as you're having a good time and all that. Thanks for the experience of being in Nightingale. Alright, have a good night and good luck. Thank you! For those of you who need to go rest, please do rest. I am literally farting about, um... Cause... Mercy is going live in two hours. I'm gonna redirect into her, and then it means I can... do a little bit of... a little bit of preparation for my monetization stream tomorrow. I'll need to actually make the thumbnail, and you get a picture of my frickin' feet for the thumbnail. Omega at low. Oh no, what did I do now? Well, we do... Night... Night mother, night mother, send your child unto me for... Oh no, sweet mother. I keep saying night mother. Apparently... it's sweet mother. I could've sworn I turned that on. Man, there we go. Yeah. Group brushing, T-minus 90 minutes, yes. Um, right. I am going to make a cup of tea if we would all like to get something to hydrate. Gotta go to Winterhold for that one. Yes. I'm gonna make a cup of tea, and then... we will... see how far we can get on the Dark Brotherhood. There's absolutely no way in heck we are getting anywhere close to it. Um... But... it doesn't mean we can't start it. Okay, man. I'll arrive late for tomorrow's stream, cause I'll be at work. It's a very short stream tomorrow. It's not Skyrim Part 2. Just, uh... for those of you who may be lurking, there is not a Skyrim Part 2 tomorrow, cause I've completely messed up the achievements, and the whole point was to do the achievements, um... and for some reason they're not working, even though I am on Xbox Game Pass. Um... But we do have plenty of time in the future. I will definitely come back to Skyrim once I've fixed whatever's going on. Cause honestly, I'm like, I should have just played cameo. Um... Sorry, we need to break in here so we can go talk to this kid. Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me for this soon. Very tired. Oh no. Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me. Send your child unto me. So you come in. How long must I do this? I keep praying, mother, for I want you to answer me. S. You've come at last. I knew you would. Are you alright? I knew you'd come. I just knew it. I did the Black Sacrament over and over with the body and the things that came in a assassin from the Dark Brotherhood. Uh... Ah yes, the Black Sacrament of course. So long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract. Your contract? My mother, she... she died. I'm all alone now. So they sent me to the terrible orphanage in Riften on her hall. The headmistress is an evil cruel woman. They call her Grelad the kind. But she's not kind. She's terrible to all of us. So I ran away and came home and performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here and you can kill Grelad the kind. Ah... Sure, buddy. A kiss by the sweet mother. What does the book say? Hand that book over. So you wish to summon the Dark Brotherhood. You wish to see someone dead. Pray, child, pray, and let the Night Mother hear your plea. You must perform that most profane of rituals, the Black Sacrament. Create an effigy of the intended victim assembled from actual body parts including a heart, skull, bones and flesh. Encircle that effigy with candles. The ritual itself must then commence. Proceed to stab the effigy repeatedly with a dagger. Rubbed with the petals of a nightshade plant while whispering this plea. Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear. Then wait, child, for the dread father sithis rewards the patient. You will be visited by a representative of the Dark Brotherhood. So begins a contract bound in blood. That's actually really cool. Oh, I'm quite happy with that. I quite like that kind of back behind the scenes, not behind the scenes because it's like hidden in a book so it's not behind the scenes. But I like seeing how the game like tried to explain it. It's a great thing. Where did he find the body part? Oh, he tried his best, okay. Probably went into the crypt or something like that. So this is probably the only instance when you can perish someone in front of a whole group of people. Sorry, hen. Yeah, you do not get in trouble for doing that. And all the kids and they're like laughing at our own stuff. Wait, oh, I've gone the wrong way. Sorry, I've gone the wrong way. We're saved. Yeah, literally one of the only instances you can walk in and perish someone and then come straight back out again. They don't care. No one cares. The Riften Guards don't even care. They must have known as well. The actual nice lady takes over. Yeah. So really, we just did everyone a big old favor. Okay. I was like finding different fun ways. Apparently you can cast Friendsly in the Children Parish Grail Oak. I'm not sure if that's true or not. Is she, you know, kind of sounds like Midoriya. I knew you could do it. I just knew it. I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me. Here, just like I promised. This should bet you a nice price. Thank you. Thank you again. What did you give me? Your child. Completed Innocence Loss. Family heirloom? Oh, sorry, sorry. My bad. I got a little... I just needed to check what your family heirloom was. Is it any? Oh, there is. A plate? A plate. I mean, you are a child, so I guess that makes sense. Now, if I remember correctly, we need to go sleep in a bed. Yeah, the first sleep the poor Dragonborn has had since I started my adventures. So, we'll just rent a little bed in here. You ever just accidentally dash across the house, honestly? Oh, you. Hello. Can you come a bit closer? Okay, I guess not. Yeah, I'd like to rent a room. Thanks, darling. Oh, okay. Ten, ten stars. Hello, my lady. You want to join me? Okay. Right, please stop talking to me. I'm trying to be sure in my room, but I'm having to help the NPC. Okay, there we go. Thank you for showing me my room. If you want the tip, just stay in the room. We're getting that bed. That's absolutely shocking behaviour. Please stop. Twelvers, we won't make a cup of tea very shortly. I'm sorry. I'm getting delirious. Miss Droney, can I be excused from history of the Nordic class to use the bathroom? Yes, you're allowed to use the toilet. Right, I am going to go make a cup of tea. What? Was that not supposed to be kidnapped? Was that not supposed to be kidnapped? After you perish? Does it have to be about the island? Huh. Give her to her, kid. It's after you receive a courier's lair. Ah! How are you streaming now? How are you so powerful? That's... It's called Othezam. And I love my games. Right, I'm waiting on the courier. Courier, courier. Courier, courier. Give me a letter. Courier, my boss. Right, ah, sorry. I'm going to go get a cup of tea to recalibrate because I have been playing for a hot second. I'm going to have to pause the game sadly because there can be NPC events such as Coltas entering the town which can kill NPCs. So I will have it paused whilst I go quickly make a cup of tea. Please do stretch your legs and get yourself a wee water and have a pee. You got to sleep. No. Alright, sorry man. I thought you had to sleep right away but I need to receive the letter with a hand that says we know and then go to sleep. Okay? I'm going to go get some water. I'm going to get a cup of tea and we're going to recalibrate and come back and meet in the middle. It will be a couple of minutes, okay? I think I can get a wee snack as well. Right, beer, beer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome to Europe. Wait, I said that wrong. Welcome to Europe, young man. Welcome to Europe. Welcome to Europe. Remember the 10 Eurovision? Remember the 10 Eurovision? Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, that was the worst Dutch I think I've ever done so far. I do apologize to any Nederland mensen who are listening in. Everyone else is just like, what on earth are you even on about? Hi. Welcome back. What, you thought I was gone forever? I've got me a cup of tea and I've actually got stroepwafel. I'm not even kidding. I have actual stroepwafel. On the rating stream but I couldn't find any more European snacks. So I'm just literally going to eat a little stroepwafel. Welcome back. I love stroepwafel. It's like crack cocaine. Sorry, but it's so good. Yes, merci for the snippets who are lurking. I appreciate you even if I'm not your flavor. T minus one hour and 40 minutes until your Kohai is ready to say hi hi and prove that she can't whistle. Which is adorable. I can't believe that I hired her on the basis she can't whistle. Stop leaving I'm not allowed to go get a cup of tea for my boys. Are you like hearing my words? Are you ending when merci comes on? Yes, I'm going to redirect into her on purpose because I didn't know I was getting monetization today. So tomorrow we're doing the monetization celebration. So I need to set up all the emotes and I need to set up on the price. And I think very sadly I have to charge more than 4.99 US dollars. But I think I might have to because of this YouTube gifting stuff. Can any of yous confirm that YouTube gifting thing is a nightmare or a hassle? I'm going to take a bite of my waffle okay? Mmm. I know it's only like 2 cents difference. I just don't like that. Hold on. I'm going to check out Marshmallows if you'd like to send me any marshmallows I'm just going to take a quick pause champ on top of everything. Jesus Christ why do I have so many DMs? Okay I don't know for the most part. Oh and now I can't see my mouse again. Okay marshmallow refresh let's go. A lot of follow girls have 1.99 tier and then 4.99 and the gift goes to the 4.99 Ah I'm at exactly $5 work I possibly Hello mommy you're asking what software baby uses for 3D is called Warudo for full body tracking there's a lot of videos about it but I think most YouTubers use Sony mo copy Slime VR or Vine trackers okay okay It's okay mommy I know you can't open my last Mario link on stream don't forget to check later Is it bad that I check? As soon as I go offline I just spend like another 30 minutes and I'm like yeah what's the problem with gifting so the issue is if someone is very kind to gift but they can't dictate what type of tier to give it means outsiders isn't a nice term to use that's not the correct term but someone who maybe what's the word? I'm trying to think someone who gets access to membership streams that like should name you know like someone who's just gonna be rude about it or whatever I don't know yeah use whatever it's better to have people watching the membership streams that are actually interested because someone might get a message and it's like oh right okay that's chicken you might be able to turn on gifting entirely well the problem is gifting is a massive money source for the girls if someone's gonna be a shitter and members content they better be paying out their own pocket that's so funny I'm sorry but that's actually such a funny statement okay scrawny and fellow reeflings I'm gonna have a fun rest of the stream oh now I need to go sorry words are blending together I'll see you tomorrow yes I think it'll be roughly 2 hours it's a short stream tomorrow do apologize but I'm needing overall vocal rest I've got quite a few vtuber ASMR collabs coming up so I'm needing to be a good girl and rest and try my best I am a Spanish reefling and I've been very no you've not hold on you've helped me pass some hard time so I just want to know that if you're really proud of you and the way your streams go also I like how you act on stream about gapping and ranking burps is fun what is what do you want in Spanish in English for me because I don't know what what do you want I think it means I don't even know you are truly an anomaly I've never seen someone who is so intensely thoughtful and caring about both your daughters and reeflings also shameless hold on what am I getting spanked by it's a level of authenticity I would never even see in a person let alone a vtuber I wish you all the success in the world wow you did an absolutely fantastic job on the tryharding in the ASMR stream I can only assume you have a really good coach since it took me over a year to study to get to that level a coach like a hypno coach no that's just called autism and general interest I just apply what I like to whatever and I do it my also it's something I would never do otherwise but my but my girlfriend has convinced me I should do bibbutes so I printed out 21 pages so I can build some additional cognitive habits at the end of the month what is this what is this what is this what is this additional cognitive habits what is this 21 bibbutes for me for me right now it's almost 5am yes please rest well for those of you who are hanging on by a thread we're just going to start off the dark brotherhood at this point I'm going to see if I can fix achievements and possibly we can come back to Skyrim but tomorrow is being steamrolled by monetization celebration stream go get those microplastics out of you somehow honestly hey lassie would you kindly read some modellups so you can see more of the girlies you can zoom out a bit too if you don't want to block too much of the game someone said they don't like it where is it I would have to go like this does this work hold on does that work it does work that's terrible I can't really can't really get away with it too much let's behave a tomato a day keeps your bars okay yes that is our new slogan ladies and gentlemen tomato a day keeps your bar health okay I'm still trying to eat the same strip waffle I'm getting so distracted so when is the audio of you rambling about Assassin's Creed or something well getting your what is this guy oh my god you guys are getting our while I'm actually doing a review on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood which should come out around November like I'm doing an actual game review footage like I'm being so serious on it so if you like hearing my accent putting you to sleep well I can tell you about Assassin's Creed and how amazing it is sometimes I wish we could see the film they're they're pretty outrageous I'm trying my best to like dart around them but good night rest well those who need to rest we love strongers the cuttlefish in this house strongy if you like being in games kind of reckon Valhalla is such a good game and I think you'll like it I most certainly will check that out I may have in another life thought I was about to play it and then play the complete wrong game which was called Helltaker I believe and it was also a puzzle game and I was so confused on why the game looked so different to what I was playing and it turns out I was playing the completely wrong game but yes I would love to give Valhalla a try hi cuttles are Mondays and Tuesdays always going to be endurance uh no they are not it's just a a quinky dink really that I put it on Monday and Tuesday but no they're not always going to be the endurance on those days um yes having you you have about to squid me right now by the Pope hey strongy I am back I know you were wondering how to pronounce my name earlier and you had it right as spiny is pronounced like a spiny anteater I'm going to be so honest Brian did not help with my confusion on the pronunciation of your name tiny spiny what and you had it right as spiny is pronounced pronounced like a spiny anteater a spiny anteater or a spiny anteater Brian just made that 10 times worse and I do apologize if I'm now officially butchering it but thank you for the tip do it phonetically in chat like right so it's either spiny or did I even spiny so you know spain e okay spiny we got there in the end literally I'm renaming everyone who who just doesn't have an easy to rename for me spiny there are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday endurance streams yes um most of the stream sniping I'm trying to do for like a big amount of time because I know not everyone's available right at the one time zone if you will uh yeah having you you have about developmental psychology and socially inculcated reactions to stress maybe realize I really wish that physical touch and infection was more normalized in society especially for men male socialized people people need more hugs easy also I'm curious how you deal with the stress and she mentioned you don't know how we do it um I always have a goal or something to work towards which helps distract me from what I'm feeling in the moment and essentially makes me like numb and work through it so like right now my goal is to help the girls achieve what they want so I'm like even though I'm stressed and I'm worried and I'm this and I'm that because they are a much more important focus on my life it's kind of one of those things where I can just put it to the side for now and right okay what's next once I get offline I have some lovely VTubers who are waiting on an ASMR collab from me I have to send away shorts for the girls I need to record that for them um like I need to do um yeah um every word is hard to pronounce if you're bad enough for example I pronounce spatula spatula honestly I think having a purpose is really useful in general yes I agree with that I also do it that way it's so tough to tackle like men's socialization because where does it start it starts in the home but then where does it get affected secondary socialization at school like I don't know if you guys had this but in Scotland um like it became so quickly oh that's gay to show any affection in any sense in a basic hug a basic handshake um rubbing shoulders against each other if you're both you get you get and it starts from there and then that isolation progresses further and further to the point where the most natural thing which is a reassuring hug or embrace when you meet someone you know um becomes this almost taboo unfamiliar territory um and it is such a shame that you even have to experience that because of the secondary socialization because your primary socialization which is your family um you know I bet your dad came home and you gave him a big hug like oh dad and when you went and visited your grandparents oh granddad grand and gave him a wee kiss and a wee hug and all that and it all goes out the window because of secondary socialization yet behind closed doors behind closed doors behind in families perfectly normal absolutely normal behavior and it's very frustrating because to even think of how to tackle it where do you even start because the way it's set up is it's your fault on an individual level that you can do these things that you can't hug your bro that you get you meet up with once a month um you can it's your fault because you didn't keep up with that societal norm you didn't break the more you like see how it's so hard to break from society's grasp at that point someone says how's the game going I'm so sorry I'm currently in a rant about the social um education that you get after sorry I'm fricking going on a rant again I can't I can't stop myself it's fascinating stuff when you start to really break it down it becomes almost frustrating when you realize how bare bones and simplistic humans are in nature and yet we are sorry I'm burping away we are our own biggest enemies we live in a society literally I'm typing that too we live we live in our society that's it I'm typing that in chat that's me getting it out there we live in our society get that out get that off your chest you're welcome to type we live in a society as well in chat to get it off your chest because we do live in a society we live in a society therapy stream when oh I'm not sure I can do that Mercy's actually doing a like terrible therapy advice stream yeah yeah we truly do live in a society um wait yes um wait yes that um sorry I just read that refling that was like your toes did everything for me and I'm like hi you're welcome after this stream tonight with all the conspiracy talk I need you to do conspiracy theory talking stream with Pippa it would be incredible love your yapping just can't wait to get enough of the adorable cut of it oh I don't know if I would go too far I've not had a chance to watch Pippa's content in a very long time um but I don't know if I would go too far and I'm like um my ideas are quite alienating as much as we were meming on needy streamer overload um my I know you're not really supposed to talk about any of that you're supposed to be like tihi but yeah I'm thinking you're never know I plan on writing a fairly long fantasy of mine I've had of you it's still cringe I want to write it though as I was extremely pent up after you do it is pace been fine for this yes I recommend it oh no strong is a moon truth oh god what's that I don't even know what that is I don't know how I don't know if I'd go too far she says when talking about the yabba okay okay okay it would be a race to see who will go too far you're a Pippa I'm like I'm probably 1984 dystopian type allegations I don't know what Pippa's field is in particular but I am dystopian based like whatever horrors of man-made comprehension you can think of have occurred you know I'm like that kind of side of things can you see can you please say in the thickest island accent eh I cast tongue positional awareness sorry that's a really rough accent but there you go what's your favourite, Pringle's favourite uh paprika I love Pippa Pippa is there and lizards are in government literally 1984 Shawnee calls yeah Pippa is just psycho she'll be, she'll go way too far quicker okay well we shouldn't egg her on how about we just leave this as eh moon truth or believes the moon is a hologram is the conspiracy theory made up to clown on eh that people actually started well well I have terrible news I'm afraid I don't meet much of the requirements of a conspiracy theorist eh I'm afraid that yes our planet is in fact around, oh dear very controversial I know it's okay it's okay you can unsubscribe unsubscribe at least it's not far and high four five one yet right oh oh yeah yeah far and high four five one yeah what happens if the reason why um a lot of media before a certain year was kind of scrubbed on a mass level is so people realise eh people don't know that in a few hundred years I try to get a sense of that we live in a society where I go into the darkest and most remote German forest and someone still reports me because I pee against a tree true iron reaver true right imagine burning books ah ha ha ha ha you're a round aether unsubbed I can't believe it the moon round the sun round the earth on a turtle's back and world of warcraft that's all I'm saying the earth is round oh wait isn't it not like a there's like a certain name because it's like a wonky round and not a perfect round ah something like that uh have I shared any bibboots I actually don't share them with the girls um just because I've I don't know I just it's never really occurred to me to do such a thing an oval lumpy ball yeah lumpy ball remember to check your balls regularly and if you find the lump get it checked out ladies and gentlemen and before you go it's embarrassing I assure you the person who is doing the ultrasound on your boss act has already looked at about 10 sacks that day already and within that week has probably seen over a hundred I assure you your resticles raggy are not that unique okay get yourself checked out if you are worried an ultrasound yeah that's what they do against your um if you have a bump you get an ultrasound on your resticle raggy that's not the thing is it not an ultrasound I checked I'm clear oh I mean if you want to I mean we could check live if you wow I zoomed through the backlog at two times speed after hearing back where you read my marrow but my raggy sacks I found a lump and they have no idea what it is some things can be completely benign like you know we all come out a bit wonky can you come out 100% a perfect specimen now it's definitely thing had me balls just sounded clear okay as long as you're clear if you really want to yeah right okay everyone follow my okay do your hands have calluses rougher smooth feet question mark um I have what's called hyper hydrosis um especially in my feet and I do have it in my hands um which means my hands are always very smooth um I have no dryness because I am constantly wet really there's nothing else to go off by um but yes I always have like kind of moist hands um so they're always soft and so are my feet are incredibly soft so yeah there you go now you know I was actually going to do a donut on reward where I give the like for a second and third place like high highs that I've worn but obviously with my sweaty feet constantly wet they're not like dripping not dripping I don't need Botox if you didn't know Botox will paralyze the sweat cells um but they are constantly having like a they're not dry put it that way most guys hands are like dry so when you go like when you rub your hands together it's like but when I rub my hands well when I put my hands together I can fart with my hands because they're always clammy and wet and yeah that's very true I can always do that do it on command I can never find this emote it's called flushed that emote is called flushed I can do that breathe it in lads and lasses well you are a cuddle fish I'd be concerned if you were tonight you're so talented sweaty hands aren't fun it's a little bit annoying especially gaming with a controller because of the heat transfer it reflects straight back when I'm using a controller fart hands being when your hands are dry just hold shiny I will I have enough sweat to make your hands nice and soft as well okay there's enough to go around I assure you but yeah don't read this out loud oh my god I'm getting intel I'm getting intel I know you said you wouldn't ever approach other v-tubers but considering the similarity of line of work would you ever consider a collab with project melody both of you seem very knowledgeable and passionate about positive A in education mental health I feel like you would be great for us I would never say no but at this point in time I'm just going to focus on getting the girls their achievements stuff I would never say no but to reach out is quite daunting I'm sure anyone can kind of relate to that kind of thing I would never say no I've just said that main project melody seems to be like opposites and yet the same type thing with our kind of care and all that jazz reefling intelligent agency since you have hyper hydrolysis do you keep yourself well hydrated the way that I can tell I'm actually severely dehydrated as my hands go dry that's when I know I'm like up S Creek basically as if my hands stop my feet will never stop I have never been aware of my feet stopping sweating lucky me I was always so embarrassed and as well I don't know if you guys have school dance but I used to like rub my hands on my trousers like really quickly before I like and I'm sure I bet you my dance partner like whoever you got on the day felt like I was doing it on purpose like oh boy and it's like no I have a really bad sweat problem I don't want anyone to know about it he he she's just like me for real for real melody is dark and wholesome yet darkly lewd you're nerdy and yappy and intensively lewd through the sneak I've never been to a school dance oh I guess maybe not every country does it but we had to learn like Scottish traditional dance like the gay garden did you say the gay garden yes gay isn't happy ha ha ha we get it we're called gay garden which means happy dance never been to a school dance can't relate I have hyperdologists too so I'm constantly dehydrated suck had school dance here in New Zealand it was similar cause I hate having to wipe my hands hi hi Astrone what sort of maros would you hate to receive

minute there you suck at Skyrim when you're gonna finish it oh you've got me tell me how bad I am at the RDA side oh you've got me I can't believe it I should probably drink my tea and then we'll jump back into Skyrim that's right the tunes are on tunes are on okay I'm hydrating I'm hydrating she doesn't even know how to chase the RDA oh you've got me I didn't know to put the grenade launcher on who would have thought a grenade launcher I can't believe it I'm being I'm being dunked on I would probably say the thing that would genuinely upset me the most is if someone sent me something nasty about the daughters and obviously if that starts to appear in the inbox I know it's not to pay heed but it's probably the worst thing I can imagine but then again I was like well you're subjecting me to that and not them so it is what it is I like how she goes idle I self defend well it's actually for hunting but I think it can be used for a distraction as well before I ink on you I just ink on you and run away like what you're gonna do about it before you can even react I'm already gone if you ever play a follow game do you go for stats or stylists oh stats I absolutely cannot for the life of me by the pope what no way miss Morgan that's hilarious that's hilarious congrats on getting back hopefully work went well and it wasn't too painful or perishing that's absolutely hilarious thank

2 oh no I love that actively wait you can't go that way I love that actively when you talk like when you do stuff in Skyrim like the NPCs kind of discuss it I think that's such a cool little detail I have to admit for a game for a game that came out in 2011 and was produced like before that that was pretty I don't give a that's pretty decent you know like you're gonna give it to them sometimes can't can't give them all the credit but you gotta give it to them sometimes uh unfortunately I believe we do we have to go south no we don't I'm just taking super long obnoxious way so I'm going to teleport back and then I'm basically just gonna go along the water's edge to get to the stone store death is highly overrated infamous last words IS the elusive warhammer staff literally oh you didn't see it coming just imagine how cool Skyrim 2 will be did they even announce it yet or am I going crazy and they have jeez how do I get down I've not just done that have I that'll be fine that'll be fine on the old ankles right maybe this will do easy easy just edge it a little bit nice and slow slowly slower good boy that's terrible I shouldn't do that that's no need you shouldn't egg me on either Elder Scroll 6 is in development okay okay I could have sworn they hardly freaking talk about the damn thing I can't with you oh my god literally it's too easy the problem is you give me too much power and then I get high on it and I just do it all the time I'm not being funny that girl gave me far too much power with me seeing them freezes excuse you excuse you give me your soul no oh I'm out of soul gems where the heck am I going where the heck am I supposed to go straight ahead into the water why not get a horse it takes too long doesn't it I thought it tastes like fruit and the

redirect into mercy because unfortunately my achievements bugged out so it kind of may or may not have defeated the whole purpose of this achievement run man we keep running into Talos literally he was like that snake and then he was like yeah I don't care I can't I'm boss I'm bossing on me what if we weflings get the power anarchy very classic if you power over me bro if you're actually making me blush you need to stop I'm like oh my god a girl me you like me can't comprehend it can't comprehend it doesn't make sense what do you mean the Scottish accent can you cringe out your boots what do you mean surely too much power Talos knows see I'm a little I'm walking in a Talos north west so I can't even talk I'm getting flustered thinking there's a girl watching me what the fuck okay right I'm just going to confess this straight off the bat so I used to play Call of Duty and whenever there was like a girl on my team I used to get really flustered and I couldn't even talk properly I just like completely clam up and I'm just like uh uh uh and I just get really like freaking terrible about it so it's really I don't know why I still haven't come over yet because I played a few rounds of valorant and it happened there was a girl on my team and I couldn't speak at all in voice chat and I don't know what it is and it's not even like I'm trying to like impress her or anything I just like get all weird and like I don't want to bother her you know I'm being weird oh I'm like it's not like I'm trying to like pick someone up or anything and I'm like freaking Call of Duty I don't know why I get all clammed up and it's happening it's literally happening right now in live stream and I'm like oh my god now everyone knows I'm a weirdo and I'm like uh talking to Wham is hard okay better not speaking and starting to say bad jokes she's just like the majority of guys climbing up like basically every other player of honestly girls are still here wait until she really is so the reason why it feels like it's different for valorant girls is because like I'm not trying to I don't know I'm not like trying to you know get anything out of them no that sounds really odd that makes it sound like I'm freaking honing in that sounds really odd hold on let me think anything thank you for the dono iron reaper again or the tip one or the other it's either the tip or the dono either you're giving me the tip or the D it's up to you your choice call that a clam gem shawney climbing up if speaking to women is hard then you sure are very talented at it well I'm like freaking my hands are sweating now and I'm getting my faces already it's burning up I can feel it and I'm like oh my god I need to like right hold on can I even can I hurt you on your own balcony no question mark oh my god look at the way that was my business oh I got detected oh yeah oh yeah I got detected get me out get me out get me out there is a sanctum here by the way for the don star based off of yesterday's stream most of us can probably give you the tip honestly didn't you say that your hands are always sweating yes but I am I do have physical reactions to like stressors and it can make them sweat even more my left hand is currently soaked and my right hand I'm like touching my face hi sleigh saber you're not a girl too are you I can't take anymore I can't take anymore I'm losing it yes right what was I saying right because the violour girls are like mm-hmm I don't have any it's not like I'm trying to do anything no I'm trying to do anything I don't want to sound like I'm prederon oh I can't freaking say sentence anyway this is skyrim it's a really good game it came out in 20 actually came out on November the 11 2011 which is release date was 11 11 11 11 which was really cool little tidbit if you didn't know okay I'm getting absolutely trolled right now the weather anyway anyway hi nothing I don't want anything anything wait oh I got bounty added to me that's not good that means the guards are always going to come up to me unless I clear the bounty could you imagine you could start short circuiting well that's why the plastic on like the controller and that is really good for that that issue I got steam I fear for the girl I say I didn't know you were there oh my gosh I say that was terrifying this is the riskiest thing I've ever done do not go down a waterfall whatever you do by the way that's a terrible choice can I teleport back to I can't no I can't are you still playing on legendary yes I am I never was not playing legendary at any point I can show you again if you want

Miss Morgan I appreciate it what was I showing oh yeah I'm on legendary look a little to the left see look see legendary I've been on it the entire time I don't know why anyone thinks I'm not on

what do you mean see where am I oh I'm still running away from the guards the guards aren't chasing me they can be I'm in the middle of a waterfall the guards are chasing me oh there's an in route let's go get an in route thank you for the tip again Miss Morgan I never doubt what you mean me in fact they have made legendary for strong specifically because the game was too easy true Andrew am I being can I just teleport to my location so I can progress with my campaign what is shooting bow and arrows at me is that Lydia is Lydia turned against me too get me down the stream I'm a fish I'm actually a fish get me this is literally what it looks like from the outside POV you're just zooming down the rocks okay can we teleport now yes we can she's just so good guys honestly I get so much she might have changed or something well I was going nope not at all absolutely not definitely a MLG gamer and she tells you a problem because I'm so good literally I don't know why people seem to struggle not playing on legendary oh Cicero you dare risk disobedience and surely punishment are you squiddin me right now by the Pope the benefits of being Scottish so use it to your advantage as much as you can okay thank you for the tip Kitsune use my Scottish accent to my advantage I think I might or may not be mildly rather submissive at the moment so I can't think of much to say oh pardon me putting out my weapon in the middle of a cutscene Cicero we've got business to discuss do you have a contract for me is this over for Marsh feeling submissive feels like a huge hammer honestly why does Cicero sound like junk oh why would you say something like that I've already done that nice Cicero it's good to meet you too Cicero just keep your distance Jester and we'll get along just fine it's good to meet you aww I would like to keep him alive this time why did you come to the sanctuary Cicero come to Bravil aggressive sub how much did they spend on this freaking voice actor Hughes he nailed it what are your duties of a keeper tell me about yourself Cicero not about the night mother by the pope who goes there thank you nice Brian for delivering that have you got a pole I want the pole if you've got a hole I want the hole don't swap you don't need a swap the listener what's a listener Cicero Stroney's an equal opportunist are you scooting me right now you dislike Cicero oh you don't like his character our lady has not chosen I mean like Cicero I like to dislike Cicero but Cicero is like trying to a little rush Stroney's such a good right you're done collectively you're done oh wait I was supposed to hand in the contract so we didn't pay attention thank you for the tip anonymous but no you got a pole keep the pole you got a hole keep the hole don't be swapping stuff

like a lot of like bad memories came back to the surface but they got completely manually overrated just because of like the love and like everything that we didn't like the girls and I couldn't have predicted anything at all it was impossible to predict and we were dealing with a major calling at the time which was really messing with how to predict anything at all okay but what were we supposed

that would actually be quite funny I wouldn't mind doing that um our next collab is actually power washer sim where you get to see us all together because someone not naming names refling guessed the entire reason why we're playing power washer first out of all the games of course you had to figure out what the freaking plot was um but yes I will see you giffy givers tomorrow brushing your teeth oh I don't have my toothbrush here can we am I allowed to do it tomorrow I'll still work my teeth but we'll do it on stream tomorrow like after the uh the foot part but thank you so much for having me

wouldn't you or a good girl yeah only nine over stream yeah just uh just a little bit but yes we will be good together and we don't need to worry um it should remain up and uh I think that's everything I have to say it's possible do we have to stagger our monetization celebration days or can I if I did two if I did two hours and then perfectly read into chibi yeah that's fine if she decides to do hers as well because I'm not going to tell her not to do it you know I'm not going to say no six I was shaking my head I'm such a fake gamer I can't believe I'm such a rubbish streamer nine hours she said again okay I have to learn that being called a good boys okay I've learned that being called a good boys move oh it's supposed to make you weak in the knees you're supposed to get weak in the knees for me it's simple okay you behave you get rewarded a very fair and simple exchange oh you do have to go to 599 to avoid gifting you're joking please tell me you're trolling me and it's not 599 is it actually 599 I don't think I can charge that much that's not fair why did gifting change does gifting not go to the lowest tier are we sure gifting doesn't do the lowest tier what's gifting so when someone is monetized you can gift membership to other people and I specifically I'm having you know what we could test it on me we could test it on me tomorrow I know how to dance the line okay we'll test it on me tomorrow we'll see what happens strongy speaks English strongy speaks and my heart becomes weak 100% sure it doesn't seen tons of channels with 199 it goes from 499 let me cook and I'll put the price that I want and I think it's fair and we'll see what happens and if it's just an absolute cluster minuster then we'll deal with the fallout on me at least and then the girls are unaffected by any fallout the fear of that thingy but I've never seen it happen nah and it's like you have to turn on being able to be gifted yes I would I would put it on because it's a big income source and I have terrible news I spent a lot of money I just yeah feeler wasn't cheap let's put it that way yes not even fallout in New Vegas what about fallout in New Vegas I've seen 399 and 799 that's rubbish that's not nice if they use it they have to turn on being oh they have to turn on being able to receive gifts as well okay okay well that's a team effort just a wee bit of money just a wee bit of pocket money that's a lot right I will let you be carried away to mercy gently well she gives you terrible advice and we'll take it from tomorrow and see if we are able to make everything run smoothly and if not thank you for the stream bye amy I modded like all of yumi on my channel oh yumi much problem now oh ho ho ho teasing but yes I will see you all tomorrow for
