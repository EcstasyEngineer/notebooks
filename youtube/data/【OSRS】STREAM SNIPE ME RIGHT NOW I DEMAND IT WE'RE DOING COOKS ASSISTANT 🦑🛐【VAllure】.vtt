00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm sorry.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm sorry.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm sorry.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Bruh.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Everything is breaking right now.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Holy crap.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Everything has broken.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
I can't even hear in-game sound.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be here in the music right now.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Hold on.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm so sorry.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Everything broke from yesterday.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
And my headset isn't registering sound at all.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I knew it wasn't.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
You're lying to me.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Oh, the scuff isn't working.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh, here we go.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
No, I just had to test it with some music.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Okay.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I can now hear the title music?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Yes, I can.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
And you can hear it too.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I don't know how loud it's going to be though.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh my god.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Anything that can break will.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, I didn't change a single thing from yesterday's drum.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh, I apologize for being late.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Little refunds.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
That was horrific.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I haven't even been able to watch yesterday's words.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
I know the next stream is starting.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
How are we meant to keep up with your strongy?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
That's the fun part.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I have endless stamina.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
See, those details come really good later on.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Right, I don't, I need to, I mean,

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I'll tell you what world we're in.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Right now I'm entering world 424.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
But I want tutorial island.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
So please don't worry.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
What was that first song?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
It was called Music Makes You Lose Control.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Music makes you lose control.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Let's go.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Please don't worry if you've not actually got your character

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
outside good ol' Lummi Castle, Lumbridge Castle.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I've not even done the tutorial part.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I do.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm playing with a plugin called Runelight.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
But we're just going through tutorial island super quick.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm not.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Oh no, I just liked it a brand new.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh, we're doing an indepth in tutorial island then.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Ah.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Ah.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
I've actually been smart and I've prepared a whole meal.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
It was absolutely chaos getting, like,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I was trying to get Runelight to work on screen

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
and I was trying to cook fricking my,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
well, technically my breakfast, but I call it dinner.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
But, and I actually have, like, the world's saddest fricking rose,

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
I think it's called, like, rosemary sauce when you have it with shrimp.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And, ah.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
So, I do have membership.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
As is in the finalized world, please,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I've not even got through this tutorial.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Right, let me just skip through this fricking tutorial.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Oh, my phone's in the way.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh, my God, no.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I can't skip this.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
This is going to take so long.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Oh, right.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Yes, we'll talk to the survival specialist.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Look, that's what I'm eating right now.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Unironically, I'm eating that right now.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm good.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Wait a minute.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
This game's based on real life.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
How cool is that?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
We're going fishing.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Would you fish me up?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Huh?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
But anyway, good morning.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Good evening.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Good afternoon.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I apologize.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
It's been fricking chaos.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Since there is no work tomorrow,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm commit to catch the full stream today.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
No way.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Thank you for the tip, Virginia.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
There is no way.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Literally.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh, ace the con, Snow Bear June, as well.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Thank you for the tip.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm about to munch on.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I've got bex, pate, oh.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Right.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
And then I've got shrimp.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
And then I've got a rose, a sauce,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
while I've not made it correctly,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
because I didn't fricking squeeze the water

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
out of the prawns.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Hi, ready?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Hi, ready?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Hi, acey and Snowberry Raiders.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
But if you put all those words together,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
it becomes reading.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Are you splitting me right now?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Strony.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
You're eating marshmallows last night

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
inspired me to try to write something

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
to make your heart flutter,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
because I think it's adorable.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Are you going to read more tonight?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I can definitely read more.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Thank you very much, Gramble, for the tip.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, I can definitely read more.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Oh, I'm sorry to...

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Trying to eat and beat and vape

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
and do everything all at once.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Hi, we're playing RuneScape,

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
an old-school RuneScape.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
We're going to play multiplayer

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
and do quests together.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I am called Scottlefish,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
because I totally did not steal that from a roofling.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Thank you very much.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
But yeah,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
we're going to do good.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I am not...

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm going to move to a free world,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
but if you want to make a new account,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
we are going to do, like, the free quest,

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
like, Cook's Assistant and that.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Where the heck am I supposed to go?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I don't know.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm not paying attention.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Now that you have logged, it's time to light fire.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh, okay, pardon me.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Pardon me, excuse me.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm going to take a bite.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Ah.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Hi, it's Trombone.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
What a nickname.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I should have thrown it that bad.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
See?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So I've got this plugin

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
called RuneLight.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And, at least, it's really good.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I think it's really good.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
If the game needs to be louder,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
please do tell me.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I actually think it does need to be louder.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Because I'm, like,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
screaming over all the things.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
What next?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Moving on.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Well done.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Moving on.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Moving on.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I've completely forgotten how

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
the tutorial goes,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
because it's been so long.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
I'ma take another bite of my food.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But, yeah, if you want to join in,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
don't worry, you can literally

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
make a character right now

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
and be faster than me.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I will tell you what world we're on.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
We're all going to meet outside

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
of Lumbridge Castle.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
So whenever what world we'll get,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
we will do a Chicky Lumbridge Castle.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And then we'll take it one by one

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
and we'll quest.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Right?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Let's start with Cook's Assistant,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
because, obviously, this is a bit squished.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
And my goal is to get 99 cooking live.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Like, not in this one stream.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Okay, not in this one stream.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't know how to do that.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Although, I think of Fletching.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
If you have, like, a ton of GP,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
you can actually get 99 Fletching

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
in one day or something like that.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I can't remember.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I think it's Fletching.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You can kind of smurf of it,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
smurf of the cheese of it.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
All in one stream, crazy.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
No, no, stop getting hype.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
It's not happening in one stream.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Okay, quest journal.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Yep, you're going to do the free quest first

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
as best as we can.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
And then we might move on to membership quest,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
but I do want to give Beefling the chance

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
to come hang at Lummi Castle, the glum castle.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Any, any lummers?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Any hashtag, a lummer?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm taking a little bit.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
It's super expensive for a member.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah, it's really expensive, actually,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
to do the thing, but, um,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
membership in this game is so expensive.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I remember

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I asked my mum

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
to buy me membership when I was away,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
and it was, like,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
cheap as anything, and she never got me it,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
because she didn't understand what the game was,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
and she was like, why do you need it?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Why do you need it?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm like, mum!

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I want membership!

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Ryan!

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
No way!

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Are you...

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
You must have been so many iron reaper

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
that I managed to get an eight hour sleep

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
after that stream.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I don't know how long the endurance stream...

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It was, like, three quid the last time I got it.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Honestly, I remember, like, begging my mum,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I was like, mum!

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I want membership, but she never understood my games.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And then that's when I go to Dad.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
See, Dad, Dad knew.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Dad knew what was going on. He knew the games.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Mum and Dad!

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
What were we doing?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm not talking, I'm right.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Hello, my name is Skullfish!

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I still live.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I usually sleep four or five.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
You guys all insomniacs, I got four hours.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Good enough for me.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Bro, that's not healthy, honestly.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I woke up and I felt sick today,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
and I was like,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
is that because

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
you will be told to equip items later?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
You don't have access to the interface for equipment items?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Oh, okay, one more, thank you.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Right, shovel on now.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Oh, okay.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Brian!

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
No!

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, I actually quite like that sentiment.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Thank you, Tim Shortle.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I think Tim Shortle's the way I'm supposed to say it,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
because there's no way it's like any other way.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Right, let's go.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Combat interface, right?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, beautiful, let's stab.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Give him a little stabby stab.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Damn rats.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
All right, hold on, hold on.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Nope, too far, too far.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Inbought, inbought.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I...

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Whenever I've watched RuneScape Streamers,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
they're always super zoomed in.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
They're like, oh yeah, look at that.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
And I'm like, bro,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I need to be able to see what I'm looking at.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I can see the health bar,

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
I can see everything,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
and we battle down the area.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm not setting anything up

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
before anyone complains.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Chat sleep.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Chat needs to rest as much as me.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I've got absolutely no sleep at all.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Are you all insomniacs?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
You're all...

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Literally all holding on for the ASMR stream.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I'm getting my nails done

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
after the ASMR stream.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
So I hope you're all ready.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Oh no, wait, sorry.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I'm supposed to do range weaponry.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Can I do it from through the gate?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh, I can.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It's cheating.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Didn't realize old-school room shape...

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh, didn't realize old-school RuneScape membership is 8'9".

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
No!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Bro, the inflation has hands.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm sorry, but...

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
All these things being like,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
oh no, cost of living.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Well, you're not paying your pay...

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
You're not paying your employees more.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
So I don't know why we're pretending

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
the cost of living is a thing

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
for these companies.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
That's it also.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
You're doing your nails

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
for the sweet-eating stream.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Uh, yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
How else are you going to, you know,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
do my hands?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
You need to be able to imagine

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
my hand wrapped around...

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
That's terrible.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
We're just started.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
I was doing a lot of food filming.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh my god, I'm rich!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm rich!

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
We're rich!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I've got 25 coins.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Are you squeezing me right now?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Brian!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
That's because I had problems sleeping.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Thank you for the tip, Tharya.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Oh my god.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Right, so you can do voting.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Like, if you're like hardcore,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
well, it's not really actually,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
but it's actually quite quick to get the...

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, I've just skipped past the bit that tells you.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Oh, what should we vote on?

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Should Firelight a new level 77 demon bait?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Bro, I...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I've not...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Whoa, these are like the same question,

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
but different.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I have not...

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I have not played enough RuneScape.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
I'm like the basic RuneScape part, okay?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Before you think I'm going to start getting prayer pots out,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I'm going to start, uh,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
what is it called?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Like, PKN.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
No, I'm not PKN.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm not doing that.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I'm not happening.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
No, I'm called Squatfish.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I've got membership 30 days left.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Oh, no, you can't see it because I'm a big ass, hey.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Who's grabbing this?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
What world?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Okay, world can hold 2,000 members.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Okay.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
We're very lucky,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
but I don't think there's 2,000 recently

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
available at StreamSnipe.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
So, uh, the good thing...

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Oh god, it's probably a bit too heavy.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Please don't show my email and password.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
That would kind of suck.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
But then again, let's just throw away the purpose.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
On the way to victory, to victory, to victory.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I'm on the way to victory.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
So, into the church I go.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Hello, mister...

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Hello, Mr. Brace.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Any bracers?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
What is PKN?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Player killing.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
It's when you attack players

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
and you sell the goods that they drop, basically.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
But, uh, before anyone thinks I'm going to turn into PKN,

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
yeah, good luck, mate.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
That's what happens.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I'm doing this tutorial right now.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I'm going to eat my food outside Lumbridge

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
so everyone can get a chance to group up

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
if you want to start on a new account

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
if you can go questing together.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
So please don't panic if you think, like,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
oh no, I've not got enough time to join in.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
You absolutely do.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I am going to make it so.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I eat my foodies.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
I've got a cola and two bottles of water with me.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Um, as for those of you interested,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
if this is, uh, an...

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Where the heck?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Oh, it's...

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Where the heck am I supposed to go?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
It's not blinking anything.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I'm grabbing the booze.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You will be shown how to cast spells.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
When you get there, just talk to the magic instructor.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I assume you can hear them.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Oh, of course it pops up.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
What are we doing?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I'll hop on.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
We're going to just do basic questing

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
because I've started a fresh account

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
and we're going to try and get 99 Kooten.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
However, open up your final menu.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Ah!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Am I done?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Okay, not yet.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
We're about to teleport to Lummi

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
and then I'll pick a free-to-play server.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Um, and...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh my god, I'm casting the chicken.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
You wouldn't cast the chicken, would you?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Would you?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Who goes there?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Everyone has some when you trust a lure into the world, eh?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Can I?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I'm so sorry, but I'm going to confess

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
my biggest sin,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
and you guys honestly aren't ready for it.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I used to be double in money

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
and take people's money.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
The biggest amount I ever took was 100K gold

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
and then I stopped.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
I don't know how I didn't get banned.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I think because I did it in such low increments.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Um...

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Right, send me to the mainland.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I'm so sorry.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I used to be the one at the Grand Exchange.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I was like a little kid

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
because what happened was

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I got fricking scammed.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Hey, Scottfish, come over here.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Adventure or John?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Um, I got scammed

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
and then I realized, wait,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I can just scam other people

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
to get my money back!

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Double in gold!

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Double in gold!

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And I'm like, I got all the money I lost back.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
It's time.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Officers, it's her.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Literally, I was like a little

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
nine-year-old hustler, like,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
like, oh, it's terrible.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
So if you ever got done at the Grand Exchange

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
because you were a silly, silly McGee,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
guess what?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
It was probably me!

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
We're gonna hang out at this fountain

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
at Lummi Castle right here.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
We're gonna hang out at the little fountain.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I am going to Swap World.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Wait, why is it flashing?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
It's...

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Why it's flashing?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Right, what world are we gonna go to?

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I'll make it a free-to-play world.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Where...

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
How do I...

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Change worlds?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Whoa!

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I think World Shifter's up here.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Um...

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Free-to-play trade?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
No, it's got 900 people in it already.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Do we want free-to-play trade?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
There's 900 people in it?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Jagex is watching you now.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
They better not be!

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
I'm in trouble.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
We're gonna hang out at Lummi Castle

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
until I've finished my dinner.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm trying to eat it on my breakfast.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Everything's set.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
What world do we want?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Free-to-play is good.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Right, we'll just do the classic

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
free-to-play trade-free world 301.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
There's 900 folk in it,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
so we've got all the room in the world.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Take me...

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Are you sure you wish to go to World 301?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yes, sir!

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Let's...

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Let's cycle!

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Okay.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I don't know where the heck the reef ones are,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
so we'll come a little over to the fountain.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Oh, no!

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
What are they used?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
I don't know.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
We might need to...

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't know.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I don't want...

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Are these reeflings in game?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Wait, wait, wait.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
We're gonna go over to the tree

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
to make sure these are reeflings.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Holy crap, are they?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Brian!

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Evening, Alessandro.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Thank you for the tip.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Oh, my God!

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
They're reeflings!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Oh, my God.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Oh, you're looking at...

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh, my God.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Wait, you guys are actual...

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Some of you are actual players, though.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Oh, why are you so high level?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Oh, someone's got tiny cuttles.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
That's funny.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Wait, you guys are like actual...

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I miss Fauna.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
It's such a good name.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh, my God.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Just yummy.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Hello, hello.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Oh, my God.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You guys are like actual skillers and stuff.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Good morning, reeflings.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
They're saying,

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Oh, that's crazy.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Strony surprise attack gamers.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I know, but I didn't know if you guys were going...

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Oh, my God.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
You stole my drip.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
You look like me.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Oh, you guys...

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
You get stood on.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I see a Strony.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
You guys are like so high level.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
That's amazing.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
You guys should probably teach me how to play the game.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Unfortunately, we can't...

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
What is that?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Why is he standing like that?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
What does it mean?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Am I to raid him like a pony?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh, the guy's got the magma cape.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I've never done the magma cape before.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I have a stupid snowflake account.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
So I won't join.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
What does that mean?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I have a snowflake account.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Steals her legs.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Snowflake, by the way.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
What does that mean?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Oh, my God.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Look at your fit.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Your outfit's so unique.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
You're holding a puppy.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
And you've got like little things going on on you.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Right.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
A lot of you are like over leveled like heck.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
What is this in his hand?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
A fish.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Is that me in his hand?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Come on, guys.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Oh, why is your name that?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Oh, no.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Why would you rename yourself?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Oh, no.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Trick or treat.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Let me take.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I don't think I get...

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
We want to see what you got, Sans.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Show us what you got whilst I eat my dinner.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Where did he go?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Wait, did he just disappear because I looked down for one second?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
It says you guys want to trade me,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
but I don't think I can trade because I'm a new account.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I don't think it works.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
I think I need to go quest and to like unlock trade.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
If you guys are wanting to give me anything.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Is it in the stream to trade?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah, like I don't think you guys can trade me anything.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
So don't worry.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
We're going to go quest and RIP, yeah.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Wait, I'm getting the fish.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
There's so many riblings.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Hello, riblings.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Thank you, everyone that can join.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Yo, we're deforestation out here.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Oh, they leveled up. Let's go.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Okay.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Trick it is.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Jeez.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah, look.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Accept trade.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I don't think you can trade because I'm a new, new, new account.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
What?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Are you giving me?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
A rope and a fish?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Are you telling me?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Are you doing that?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
No way.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
You can trade that.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
No way.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I have a fricking rope in my inventory right now.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Wait, can you only give me like World 301?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Yeah, this world is full sad.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Why?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Oh, the world is full.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Okay.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Wait, wait, hold on.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Right, we're going to move to...

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
We're not doing...

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I don't know what these are.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
The regular bought items can't be traded.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Okay, we're learning.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Right.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
The world is full, so we're going to go to an emptier one.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Everyone get ready.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
High risk world.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah, no thanks.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I have a bow.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Is there like a really easy one we can get inside?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Clan Wars?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I don't know.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Do we get grouped on?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Are we technically a clan?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
No.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
These are just dead Oz servers apparently?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Are these American?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
380.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Someone says 380.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Hold on.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
380.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Right.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
World 380.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And we're going to Brit Bungland.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Right, let's go 380.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
World 380.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Wait, I'm double clicking.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Let me go.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
380.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Grand exchanges limited to until you do quests or play for a while.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Now you have the fish.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
You're canonically strong.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Okay, okay.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Oh, look at the replays.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Okay.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
World 380.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
How do you dance?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Oh my God.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
It's been so long.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
How do you dance?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I want to dance too.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I can dance.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
I'm sure I can dance.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Hold on.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Let's go.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Grand.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Little dance.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Look at that.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Look at that.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Look at that.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Look at that.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
What?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
What?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
I'm stunning on them.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I'm stunning on them.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Look at them.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Whoa.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
What in the pivot axis was that?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
That was awful.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Don't ever do that again.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Right, we're clapping.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Okay, now dance honestly.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Grand exchanges limited to 8.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
That's not a clan.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
That's an army.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Oh yeah?

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
Will we do the refland clan and we'll go pk'ing like other clans or something?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
As if I know how the combat works.

21:45.000 --> 21:51.000
This only world where the text matters is PvP, high-risk, total and demo.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Right.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Are you ready to do the first official quest?

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Or I say that as if I've even hardly eaten any of my dinner.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Hold on.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
I'm trying to eat but I'm such a blabbermouth.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Honestly.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I can't stop.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I'm glad the refland's not stacking into one space.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Astroni can appreciate them each.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Yeah.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
I'm still convinced that guy wants me to ride him.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
Because he's like a horse, literally.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I'm so cute.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Still got people doing tutorials.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Yeah, don't worry if you're still doing tutorial island.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I'm gonna inhale my dinner really quickly.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
I'm gonna try my best.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
What is that noise?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
You're all making noises.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I can't believe it.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
I'm driving the bug.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
I'm still trying to log in.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
You're not giving people time to do the tutorial.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Only the players flexing their heads.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
How many?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh my god.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Oh, that's just an MBC hand.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Oh, someone just leveled up.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Look at how high level you guys are.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Literally got the pepper, the frog over there.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I love mummy.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Oh my god.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Sad.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Like you're your name.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Just Yome.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
You guys are like actual gamers.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Oh my god.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
You're much better than me.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I'm like scared to play the game.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I'm like you guys are gonna show me off.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
Quality player is determined by their agility and rune crafting level.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
No one likes rune crafting.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
You're not selling it here.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Get your propaganda useless out of here because you're not.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Rune crafting is the worst.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
Unless you literally have an entire army behind you to help.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
It ain't happening.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
At the end of the stream you'll be that high level.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Ah, I think not.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Yeah, I need to have agility.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
89.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
You're really good at going in a circle then.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Jeez.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
My brother was a Rinscape essence slaver for years.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Do you pay to like carry the thing?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Just don't please tell me.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Banks are for squares.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Are you an iron man?

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh, so there's different types of players you can be.

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
If you're an iron man it means you don't have access to bank or something like that.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Guardians of the Rift is experienced also.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
It's also experienced.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
So will this be a 28 hour marathon?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
No, no, I don't think it's a marathon.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
I said yesterday I thought it was a marathon but I woke up and I don't actually feel that well today.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I can't believe it.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
I can't believe streaming for 12 hours making me feel a bit wonky.

24:38.000 --> 24:45.000
I don't know why because essentially I would sit at the PC and work on like it and for like ASMR or something like that.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
But why is it when a streamer feels sick?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Like it doesn't make sense.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
I feel weak in stream height honestly.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Free cuttlefish mustache rights here.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
That's awful.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Oh, how did you...

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
What?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Ah, are you just cuttlefish right in front of us?

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I didn't know Rinscape had emotes like this.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
More active for streaming.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Maybe because you did it three times this week.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Me?

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Isn't every strong stream technically a marathon honestly?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Damn, how does one become an essence run slave?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
That's good money for that hour.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
The members emotes go hard.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Strong party.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Heck yeah.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
There's so many reflings.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
The servers are like who on earth are all these people?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
D refling.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I'll read out your name if it's refling related,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
but I was trying not to accidentally say anything.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Who is leveling up there?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Freaking...

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
I can hear someone leveling up and it's always going doot doot doot doot doot doot.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Hello?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Jack the Ripper's coming to get us lads.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
We're done for.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Maybe it was your screaming yesterday, bro.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I was so annoyed.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I listened back.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I didn't realise how angry I got.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Like I got angry.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Wow.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Oh, it's a skill cape or more?

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh my god, he's got the fishing skill cape.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Ah, jacquem prongs.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Jacquem prongs, wee wee.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
What is this freaking UFO over here?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
What is that?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Oh, is that prey?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Is that questing?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
You've done all quests.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Oh, you've got all the jelly.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Oh my god.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Wait, what's the cooking one?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Does anyone have 99 cooking?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
What's the cooking or more?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Oh, I can't wait to get it.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Oh, look at us all.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Well, binchinning.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Binchinning.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
How do I change servers?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Um...

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
I'm on the runelight, so it's plug-in, so it's up here.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
But if you're not on the runelight plug-in,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
it's...

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Down the bottom somewhere.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Smile.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
It's on the cog, I think.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I have two baked potatoes.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I've not even finished the first one,

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
and it's frickin' totey.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Like, it's so small.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I'm trying so I can't eat and talk,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and it'd be entertaining at the same time.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Quest cape, quest cape.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Ah.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Max capers shaming us all.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
Click the top right eggs, then you'll see worlds switcher on the bottom.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
The door icon to hop worlds is what they're saying.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Refillins are so MLG pro, honestly.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Like, we're not even gay people.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Oh, you're so green!

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
This refilling's, like, literally so green.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
That's amazing.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Maybe we should...

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Amala to tell us to all go buy green capes.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
For strawney.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And then we all just walk around with green capes,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
and, like, whenever we pass someone, they'll be like,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
huh, what's going on over there?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Why are they all doing their thing?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Wishes to trade with you.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
So, I can't accept anything outside of, like, regular trades.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
I know.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
You get...

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
You're giving me your crusty cum sock.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
No!

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
No!

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Wait.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
I have a crusty cum sock on my inventory.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
How did you even get that?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Okay.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Gently used.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Literally gently used.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Right.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
I'm gonna eat.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I'm gonna save maybe a five-minute countdown,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
and then we're gonna start with Cook's insistent,

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
and we'll take it from there.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
So, for those of you who haven't made an account,

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
we are on World 380.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
And we're outside Lung Bridge Castle.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
When you spawn in, we are literally just...

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
You'll spawn in this way, and we're the left of the castle.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
We're just hanging out here,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
because we don't want to bother anyone

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
that might be spawning in over here.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
But I'm starting with the character's pink hair,

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
or my same pink.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Mine has ginger hair.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Like, I'm a junior.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Which thing?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And then I've got green top,

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
and then pink...

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I think...

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Prepared to get billied nerds!

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I'm trying to eat so fast.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
It's hard.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Honestly.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I hope you guys have got hydration and eating.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
I don't know if it's an endurance stream yet.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Okay.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
But...

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Ginger hair, cute outfit, and a rope.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
You can get at me.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
380.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, 380.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
The refling in the game, of course, is gonna be...

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Don't stop until you get 99.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Bro, you think I can stream until 99?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Cooking?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I don't even know how to, like,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
maximise cooking.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
The closest I ever got was, like, 80,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
but I'd rather do it live with you guys.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Buying girlfriend 50 gold.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
What happened to party hats?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
I don't remember people were, like,

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
renting party hats in quotation marks.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I don't know what that means at all.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Delicious coke.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I say delicious as if...

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
it's just not a regular fizzy juice.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Well, actually, it's, like, one of the most popular fizzy juices, so...

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
They decided not to have exclusive one-time items.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Oh, even though they're tradable?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I guess they didn't, like, give enough out?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Possible?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
They can...

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
They became common.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Oh!

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
They made it common.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
You go to a good place for cooking

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and you cook till the number says 99,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
or you run out of money.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
With some of the fish.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Okay, you're done.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Oh, people are getting, uh...

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
minigames.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
I was, like, I'm saying,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
come along with me, Miss...

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
I Miss Fauna.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Wakey-wakey, I Miss Fauna.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Max Capers.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
How much playtime?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
232 days says one.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
314 says another.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
I can't believe my little...

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
My little reeflings are adorable little nerds!

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
I can't believe it!

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
You can do just a feckin' adorable!

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Any language game?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
That's so precious.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I'm glad you found a game

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
that you really enjoy

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
and can, uh, throw yourself inside.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
It's... When you find that game,

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
it's really nice.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Anyway, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
let's get started.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Mmm.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Yesterday, Avatar,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
No Capitalist Simulator.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
This is all really a trust.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Someone says 63 days,

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
and I haven't even left this area,

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
uh, someone says 1,650 hours

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
for a total of 1,800...

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
I can't read numbers.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Uh, big number.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Big hours for big number.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Thank you.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Mmm.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Well, more reeflings?

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Have we got more reeflings joining us?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Someone's got...

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Oh, someone literally is called Swiss Oak.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
A snowflake among snowflakes.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Wait, what am I missing?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
What is this?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Is this, like, super runescape terms

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
that I don't know about yet?

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Or is this literally, uh,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
take the word heart

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
and remove the H and replace...

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Remove the H and E

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
and replace it with an F.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Relax, snowflake.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
It's called Dark Humor.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Is that the joke?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Or am I missing Platinum?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Respect for the Iron Man.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Snowflake accounts are accounts

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
that have extremely restrictive stipulations.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
What does that even mean?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
You've somehow...

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
You can't...

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Snowflake is a special account.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Wait, the Venezuelans are the snowflakes?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Game is not degen enough.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
We need to make it harder.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
What the heck?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Honestly.

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
I think this girl in crossbones

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
means this guy's a p-care over here.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
I'm okay.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Can only do content in a region.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Jeez.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
One guy's playing the game

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
where if he takes damage,

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
all...

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Oh, I know!

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Uh, the...

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Swamplet X guy.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Yeah.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I've not actually watched that series.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
The No Hits run series,

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
but, yeah.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Region locked.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Oh, settle!

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
That's his name, not Swamplet X.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I have still not finished

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
the first fucking potato.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I'm actually getting annoyed now.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Why is the food not getting away

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
off my plate?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I'm inhaling it.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
I'm so sorry.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
I'm just gonna have to send it.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
I can't.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
I'm getting too distracted

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
trying to, like, talk into this.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
I'm sending it.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
This is the fastest freaking

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
eating you'll ever hear of me.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
I'm chewing.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
I'm chewing.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I've got another bit of potato.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
I've never done this.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
And, um...

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Okay, I've had enough of eating.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
I'm already bored of it.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I should weigh myself, honestly,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
just so I don't lose too much weight,

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
because I stream too much.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
I was actually wondering about that,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
because I've not had a proper meal.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
I'm, like, ages...

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Ow.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
I'll cut, I'll cut.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Done.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
I'm a finger blade for my fucking plate.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I've tried to eat it.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
It's taken too long.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Right.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Okay.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I was trying to eat a baked potato

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
in prawns, and it was just taken forever.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Oh, I've had enough.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Right.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Is this everyone who wants to show up?

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Um, can chat, talk to me,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
and tell me, is everyone here

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
that wants to be here?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Talking with your mouth full,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
ASMR's running really...

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
It's fine.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Stop!

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
If that counts as ASMR,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
then I've got a ton of content for you.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Okay, is everyone who wants to be

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
questing, is in the game right now?

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Is anyone in Tutorial Island?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Someone says they're late.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Okay, we'll wait.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
We'll wait.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
We'll get a few more minutes.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Right.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
If we've got a few more minutes,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
it's time to start telling jokes.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
Why did Ernest the chicken

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
cross the road?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
To get to the other side.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Oh, thank you.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Thank you.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
If you didn't know there's a quest

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
called Ernest the chicken.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Thank you.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
I feel your pain.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
Yes, do re-log in on your questing account

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
to render the other side.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
I'm here.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
I've never opened this game before.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Okay.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
We'll stand outside the castle this time.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
We're just gonna be right outside the castle.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
If you want to start on a new quest

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
on the account just to have the shizz and giggles,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
we are going to do a main quest.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Oh my god, there's so many reflings.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It's over.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Thank you so much for joining me.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
I'm being the law.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
I'm like so fucking happy.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Like, I don't realize that like,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
oh my god, that's a lot of this playing.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Right.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Don't forget the riveting tale of

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
lily pad labor dispute, honestly.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
I'm down for some shingles.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Okay.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Why is his name erinist?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I honestly didn't know.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I can't even remember.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I hardly remember.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I'm here, but I've never opened this game before.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
What world?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I am on world 388.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Do mods have pinning?

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Can mods pin?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
World 388.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Free questing.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I might work some unable to participate,

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
but have fun, Strony reflings.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Oh, thank you.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
We will.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
We will.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I don't think mods can pin.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Okay.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Can I pin?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Can I pin?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Hold on.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Ow, don't, don't, don't.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Where's YouTube?

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Can you open up one stream?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Strony, cartels.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Tape it in.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Oh, I'm live.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm live right now.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Tape it in.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Oh my gosh, I'm live right now.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Pin message.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
There we go.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Beautiful.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Strony, after the bloke completion,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
what do you think about the bad jokes completion?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Honestly, we should.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Wish us to treat.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
I'll take anything.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I've got a crusty sock in my inventory right now.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Oh, should I?

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
You're giving me a chef's hat because I want cooking.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Yes.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Yes, put the hat on me.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
I want the hat.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
I want the hat.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
I want the hat.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Check it out.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
You can even see my bunches around.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Oh, look at it.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Cool.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Thank you so much.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Look at the hat.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Oh my God, check it.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Check it.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Check it.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Check out the drip lads.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Yeah, I'll show you.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Check it out.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Oh, I'm going to.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
I'm going to stale on them.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
You ready?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
We're going to stale on them.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
I got that stale.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Stale.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Hey, hey, hey.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Hit them with the dab.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Hit them with the dab.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Hey, hey, hey.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Oh, put it away.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Put it away.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Put it away.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Wee.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Level one cooking.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Level nine cooking.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Here we go.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Everyone here that would like to be here.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
This is him.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
I drink za.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
The thingy.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
She's cooking.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Very snazzy.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Drip check.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Certified cooking stream.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Okay.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
First quest.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Open up our little quest adventure menu.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Where the heck is that?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I can't see because the iPhone's in the way.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Excuse me, iPhone.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I'm here to do something.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Right.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
The quest is called.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Cook's assistant.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Oh, oh, here it is.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
I'll read it out for you as for those of you that are blind.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Cook's assistant.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
I can start this quest by talking to the Cook Lumberge Castle.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Difficulty novice.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Very short.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Release 2001.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Jeez.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Storyline.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Stand alone.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
No requirements and no none.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Wait, someone else wishes to trade.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I don't, you guys can't give me like main stuff.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
I am.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I'm going to head to bed early.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And I'll use the stream as a sleep bed.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
I hope I don't wake you.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
No way.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
I've got a penny.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
No.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
I have a penny as well.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Oh my God.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Wait.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Sorry.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Hold on.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Sorry.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Camera angle.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Oh my God.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
I'm a real freaking woman.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Oh, let's go.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
I look so good.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Thank you for the penny.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Thank you for the chess hat.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
If you want to gift you games, how do we do that?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
You don't.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
I buy them with my hard earned cash.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Cold hard cash.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Right.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Let's go.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Cooks assistant.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
I'll turn off running.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
We'll just walk.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Right.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
You ready?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Lumberge castle.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Do you mind?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
I don't know.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Come reflings.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
You can follow me if you want.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Wait.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Who are we fighting?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Why are you fighting that per man?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Right.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Oh my God.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Women's simulator.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Time to head to the kitchen.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Oh my God.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
There's so many.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Right.

40:17.000 --> 40:24.000
This cook is like, why are all you people in my kitchen right now?

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Right.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Yes.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Cook.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
What's wrong, Mr. Cook?

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Oh dear.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Oh dear.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Oh dear.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I'm in terrible trouble with mess.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
It's the Duke's birthday today and I should be making him a big, lovely birthday cake.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I've forgotten to buy the ingredients.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
I'll never get them now.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
He'll sack me.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
What will I do?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I have four children and I go look after.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Honestly.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Me with the...

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
What?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
What?

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
I have five babies but one of them is a goat.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
He has four babies and a goat.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
What are the odds?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Yes.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
We're going to help Cook's assistant.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Yes.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
I'll help you.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Oh great.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Oh.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
My little quest helper just popped up.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Where do I find these ingredients?

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
I think I remember where they are so I think we can just walk away.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Do I need to pick up a pit?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
I think...

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Do we need this jug?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Wait.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Are we all going to be fighting over the same jug?

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
Do we not need a jug for this quest to put the milk in?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Save yourself and run.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Buy eggs here.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
100 cold coins.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Sell an egg.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
No.

41:28.000 --> 41:35.000
Do we not have to pick up the big egg and the milk from the dairy?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Am I going crazy?

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
Isn't that like one special big egg and one special thing?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
I've got 25.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Best I can offer.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Real cheap.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
People are thinking you are doing a drop party or something.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
All the folk following.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Oh.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
No idea.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
I'm like...

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Yo.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
You guys have money?

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
I can go get some jugs and drop them.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Man's running a scheme.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I respect it honestly.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
Are you guys grabbing all his equipment?

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Okay.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Right.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
We can take off and get the egg.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Go to the front of the castello.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
If everyone has accepted that quest, we'll go to the front.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I think they changed it.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Okay.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Right.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Oh no.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
It does look like we're a drop party.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I'm broke so I can't afford any eggs.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Don't worry.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
I'm going to take you to the egg factory.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
It's me.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Plop.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Plop.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Plop.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Plop.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Plop.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Plop.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Okay.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Oh my God.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
We look like a drop party so badly.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Right.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
We're going to the river.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
The chickens aren't going to stand a chance.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
Yeah.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
So the cow milk and the eggs are across the river.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
If you follow me...

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Oh my God.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Strongly lays eggs.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I was going to do ovate deposit.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
We call these people hurting the goblins.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Il goblina village.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
We're going to milk a cow.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Milk the cow.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Milk the cow.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
We need it straight from the teeth.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
You know?

43:03.000 --> 43:10.000
A normal egg works just fine.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Yes.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Has YouTube ceased the culling?

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
I think so.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
We actually are submitting for monetization today.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Can I milk your cow or do I need a bucket?

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Oh, I milked it.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
But that's because I had a jug?

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Wait.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
Did I milk it or am I going crazy?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
She goes, Teehee, you've never milked a cow before.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
How could you tell?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Because you're spilling milk.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
What a waste.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
You need something to hold the milk.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Oh.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Oh, no.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Oh, no.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Where'd you get a bucket in this game?

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Right.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Right.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
We'll go get the eggs then.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Eggs first.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
We'll deal with a bucket problem in a minute.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Buckets are from the tutorial.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Worked for me.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
I don't have a bucket.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Oh, no.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
I already have a bucket of milk.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
What the heck?

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
I already have a bucket.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
I've already got a bucket of milk in my inventory.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
I don't know why she said that to me.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Cheeky rat, honestly.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Egg time.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Egg time.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
We go get the eggs.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
We go get the eggs.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
That's the only thing about the RuneScape plugin.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I can see the price of everything.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
You guys want to watch me beat up a chicken?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
That's right.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Violence.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Violence.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Rage against the machine.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Take this.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Oh, I just killed it with Kung Fu.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
That's right.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
And I know three other dangerous ones.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I didn't drop an egg.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
All right.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Okay.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Let's all beat up the chickens and get eggs.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Beat the chickens up.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
We're going to gang violence these chickens.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Literally the whole gang of us coming.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Someone's casting Shadow Wizard Money Gang.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
We love casting spells on chickens.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Oh, my God.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
There's like so much.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
It's just hard to see anything.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Oh, my God.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
I need to like zoom right in.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Beat that chicken up.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
No, you stole my chicken.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Wait.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
I'm going to take this egg.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Right.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
I have an egg.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
I have an egg.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
So I'm going to stand here because I've got one.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
But make sure you get an egg before you move away from this section.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Have a good day.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000

thinking it's a drop party and we're all just like harvesting right drop your

49:08.160 --> 49:15.120
wheat into the hopper and then you pull on the lever at the top of this wait are

49:15.120 --> 49:21.600

50:25.480 --> 50:32.920
legs open up oh okay okay when I said it out loud it makes sense that his legs

50:32.920 --> 50:38.280
do that is everyone got their wheat I think so

50:38.560 --> 50:45.120
there's slaves and then there's like I think everyone's got their wheat just

50:45.120 --> 50:50.720

51:13.880 --> 51:20.320
mmm when do you drown them in the sea I don't want to do that I know it's a part

51:20.320 --> 51:25.440
of my lore wheat or weed oh it's not another word that sounds the same wheat

51:25.440 --> 51:32.360
I'd like to harvest some wheat I'm gonna smoke some wheat

51:32.640 --> 51:38.120
when you're drowning we should go port sarum and vade the sea shanty at some

51:38.120 --> 51:42.800
point yeah we should but we'll literally just blast the music on film she's

51:42.800 --> 51:48.400

their third question

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.420
oh we all celebrate

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Okay, we can finish our quest. How's the treasure hunt going? I found the treasure. Excellent.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Oh, I've got an ancient casket.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Ah! I have no clue. I've got three total quest points. We've got an antique lamp, 200 coal. Oh, we've got a closed scroll.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Do we all get the same closed scroll?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Near the open desert, I reside to get past me, you must abide. Go forward if you dare for when you pass me.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You'll be sweating by your hair.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
No.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Dungeon master. Is that an easy quest?

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Was our next easy free to play quest? Hmm.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
That was...dark.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I've got one about an anagram of how I need to speak tonight. Oh my god, this music is so good. It's so good.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Someone did a base remix of Sea Shanty 2 and it's so good, I love it.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:43.000
What's the easiest mission quest that we could do? I'm not sure.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Absolute banger. I'm going to rub my...BRB, I'm going to go rub my...

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Someone said rune no treasure. What are you going to quest for? You're trolling me, that's not quest.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Pirate's treasure? I don't know. I'm sure there's this headless quest.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000
The restless ghost, I think that's it. Yeah, the restless ghost. Let's do the restless ghost because I'm pretty sure.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Okay, we need...okay, just teleport back to Lumberge.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000
So open up your magic book and you should have a teleport. It should say Lumberge home teleport.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
You open up your little magic page. I don't know if you can see it over my hair.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Oh, my hair's so big. I can hardly see my inventory.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000
But just teleport back to Lummi. We're going to do it. We're going to draw it in the ground.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Who put a cow over here? I don't even know how you did that.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Yeah, teleport to Lumberge. Open up your magic spell book and it's the very first one.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It should be on cooldown because we've been mucking about.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Okay, I'll stand here and I'll wait for my lonely thing to come.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Oh, no, I know another one. No. Get away. Get away with your stance.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Okay. Yes, your hair is big.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It is. I'm covering up my queen. My big A3.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Oh, no more silly songs. I love the way you say cow. A cow.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
A cow. How do you say cow? Who? Oh, you can also say a highland cow. That's true.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Wishes to trade with you. Hmm, what do you offer me? What do you offer me?

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Tomato and cheese. Can I cook that?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
What do I do with a tomato and cheese sandwich? Yeah.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Oh, there's the cow again. Absolutely stunning on them.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Good food. I'll eat it the next time I get into a bar fight by accident.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Okay, hopefully all the reeflings made it to the teleport.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000
That was your first time teleporting. Who is doing a snowball fight?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Okay, let me take us to the next question. Pretty sure it's over here.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Sorry, I was bumping my desk. Have you heard that? That cow? A literal woman.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I think they heal one. That's all I need in a bar fight. One cheeky bit of health.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
He he he. Right. Oh, no, it's in here. Sorry, it's in the church.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I'm sorry, I'm such a fake gamer. It's inside the church. I apologize.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Father Eric.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Here, Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. I'm seeking a quest.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I'm looking for a quest. I'm looking for a quest.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000
That's lucky. I need someone to do a quest for me.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Before starting this quest, be aware that your combat level is lower than the recommended of time.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I'm pretty sure you don't have to fight, so we're going to send it, okay?

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
We're going to send it.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Accept the graveyard through the south gate and reach the swamp.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I'm sure if you told him that, I sent you. He'd be willing to help.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000
My name is Father Eric, by the way. Please come in, yeah.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Blackwax. Take her traveling through the swamps. I've heard like a good thing for us.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Okay, the stronger reeflings are literally going to have to pick on the animals that pick on the weaker reeflings, okay?

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Because I'm going to get picked on as well.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I need what? Get a ghost speak amulet.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Where though? Fuck.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Is that from? In the shack up here?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000
We need to go down to the shack. So let's go through the graveyard.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Reeflings together strong. Literally. Why is he Father Ted?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:03.000
No, because all like, all prayer men are like ire's.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I've forgotten the name of them. The prayer man.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I'm not sure if I want to go through the swamp.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I think we might need to go around. Unless we've run through the swamp.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I don't know. The music's getting different.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I'm just a small weak reefling. Yeah, if anyone gets attacked on the way, you're going to have to like help them out and stuff.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I'm getting attacked, basically. Because we're too weak for this. Get with me, swamp.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.000
What are you doing? Let my swamp.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Oh, a priest. Aye, that's the name. It's a priest prayer man. Completely. I've forgotten that word.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:54.000
The music. And this game's set up.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
It's not highly included either. Adorable youth.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I actually had an extended family member that owned one.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And it was like the gentlest giant ever. I never got to meet her. It was like a female Highland cow.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
God, that's the most Scottish thing I could see. I had a family member that owned a Scottish cow.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
That Highland cow, which is, you know, Scottish.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Father Eric sent me to talk to you. I suppose I'd rather talk to you then.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000
What problems have you got himself into this time? It's got a ghost haunting his graveyard.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Oh, that silly fool. I leave town for just five months and you already can't manage.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Sorry. Well, I can't go back and exercise it. I vowed not to leave this life until I've done a full two years of prayer and meditation.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Two years to sit on your own, bro. Right, we need to go talk to the ghost. We now have an amulet.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000
So we're going to, you'll get given an amulet. Make sure you put it on your person.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Okay, make sure you do not waste your sprint weaker leaflings because we need to run away, like, from this fight immediately.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Two years without internet? I'd be absolutely losing it. I'm sorry.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I'd be. I'd just be...

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Oh, Brian!

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Hey, Stroney, if I wanted to share a interesting prompt for you to read, but it was too long for Marshmallow.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
How would you like me to share it with you?

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I don't think I'll have any other way.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Are all the leaflings coming?

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Leafling, you're so, you're so behind. I'm going to have to wait for them to spawn on the other one.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
But I don't want us to get attacked by the big routes.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I'm not sure. Thank you for the tip, Anon.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
If it's big?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I think Pastebin is a safe website.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Right, let's get the heck out here for these rat scouts.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Are the frogs at the swamp?

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Hey, Stroney. Hi, hi. Thanks for joining.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Two years of isolation is wild.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Literally, like, I'm sorry, but if I was isolated, I'd just straight up day and night.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000
No stop and say, I'm sorry, but I gotta do something to pass the time.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Gotta do something to pass the time, so...

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I do not know how that brings anyone closer to meditation.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Could a Pastebin link work?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Yeah, I think Pastebin's probably the only thing.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Right, I think we need to be ready to run away, so get ready to turn these running boots on, okay?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
But talk to the restless ghost.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Hello, ghost. How are you?

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Not very good, actually.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
What's the problem then?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Did you just understand what I said?

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Yeah, no, tell me what the problem is.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Woo, this is incredible.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I didn't even expect anyone to ever understand me again.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Okay, okay, I can understand you.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
But do you have any idea why you're doomed to be a ghost?

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Well, to be honest, I'm not sure.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I've been told a certain task may need to be completed, so you can rest in peace.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I should think it is probably because a warlock has come along and stolen my skull.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
If you look inside my coffin, it's no there...

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
A wreathling just closed the coffin as soon as he said that.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Okay, okay, he's missing his head. We can see he's missing his head.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
He clearly needs some head.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Oh yeah, that would be such great relief.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Okay, return the ghost's skull.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Where do we need...

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
What?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:38.000
What? We need to go to the wizard's tower?

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
What the hell?

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I don't remember that.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
No way.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I don't remember.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
It's actually quite far away.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
A wreathling was to show me something.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
What do you want to show me, wreathling?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Other player has accepted.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Oh, you're giving me fish to cook?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Wait, you're giving me this now?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Wait, I think you might need to hold on to it.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Because if I die in this quest, you need to hold on to this.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Okay, hold on to it. Thank you, but you need to hold on to that.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Because if I die, I'm going to drop all of that.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:19.000
We'll do a few more quests and then we're going to actually start levelling up cooking like for real, for real, okay?

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
But thank you so much.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000
But do hold on to that because I'm going to end up perishing.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Looks in coffin.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
So no head.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Right, are we all here?

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I think so.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
When you guys stack, it's really hard to see like if we're all here.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Hey, it's the Praise Gocher!

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Bro, I feel like I'm getting lured.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Do you trust me? Do you trust where we're going?

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:57.000
It'd be such a shame if you got lured to me.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Oh, someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like, I'm going to be mind broken by you.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And I'm like...

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Soon, soon.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Wait, is this not where the mage tower is?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Oh no, there's enemies ahead that attack us, okay?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Everyone get ready to sprint.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
There's wizards and robes here that are getting ready to attack us.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
At these trees up here, there's you trees.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Please get ready to run if you're a weaker reefling.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
We're going to get absolutely wrecked.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I'll tell you when to run, okay?

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
But it should be coming up.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
It should be coming up.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Wait, isn't there not you logs here?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Am I too late?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Eh?

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Isn't there not you logs here and wizards that beat you up here?

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I guess I must be misremembering.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I'm such a fake landscape gamer.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
That's Viroc.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Oh, should be safe.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Meet you guys at the mage bank.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Take the bridge.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Let's go.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
We're not...

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
We're north of the...

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Okay.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Everyone's following.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Sorry, little reefling.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
You need to come around.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Jump up, jump up, and get down.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
You shall not pass.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Excuse me, pardon me.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Come through.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Pardon me.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Come through.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Oh my god.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Well fought.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Right.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Be careful, weaker reeflings.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
We must run away when we do this, okay?

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Put your gold on in a minute.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Hold on, hold on.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Get ready for Friday.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Search, alter, and run.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Run like your little life depends on it.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Run on your retentacles.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Search the allers.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Search the aller, reeflings.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Reeflings scare once he spawns in.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Run away, reeflings.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Run away, run away, run away.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Go up the ladder, weaker ones.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Go up the ladder, go up the ladder, go up the ladder.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
As soon as you get the score, you need to go up the ladder.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
There's so many reeflings.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
That skeleton's getting absolutely wrecked.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
We made it, reeflings.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
We made it, we're safe.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
We did it.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
We didn't get wrecked.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I'll wait for you outside the mage castello.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
We did it today, reeflings.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
We cheated death.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
It wasn't a match for us.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Yeah.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Oh my god.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
So many of us.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
The scaly didn't know what hit him, literally.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It's closing doors.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
You've been so mean to the reeflings.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Not only are you jacking up prices artificially,

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
but you're closing doors.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Oh my god.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
There's so many of us.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Oh, he's beating up that wizard.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Oh, shadow wizard money gang.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
They love casting spells.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Death by dark wizard is a rinscape right of passage.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Honestly though, no troll under the bridge.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Yeah.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
It's normal.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Is that all my reeflings?

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Did we all make it?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Hopefully no one perished.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Sailing head.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
What?

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.000
That's a good girl's trying.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
You thought.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
You thought.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Ain't that kind of stream?

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Ain't that kind of stream?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I think if I'm feeling better,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
maybe the ASMR stream,

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I give permission for you to give it a try.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Right.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Okay, reeflings.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000
All the way back to the ghost.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Oh, unless, wait, follow the rabbit.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Follow the rabbit.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
The rabbit will take us to where we need to go.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Honestly, that rabbit outfit, not going to lie.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I'm digging it.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I'm actually digging that rabbit.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Like, I mean, you can see the hips definition.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000
You can see the yiddies.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
It's all looking pretty good.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And then headless refilling.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
You're at my render distance.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Whoever's back there had this refilling.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Look at the size of them grippers.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Oh, we're up.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
What is that?

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Someone's got like a thing on their back.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I honestly didn't know how many cosmetics there was in the game.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
If you get us beaten up by baddies,

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
because you've taken this path.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Okay, I think we're safe.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Reefling just hovering in the background.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Hey, it's constantly coming in and out of render distance.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Okay, hydration check.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I hope this taxi is better than the last.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Oh, wow.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Oh, no.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Rad attack.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Walking us to the Edgeville dungeon.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Wait, there is a place called Edgeville.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Oh my gosh, that's where we should make the home.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Oh, I was going to play hide and seek.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
And if I touch you, then you're out.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Right, where do we need to go?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Oh, we need to go to the graveyard, guys.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Yeah, there's literally a place called Edgeville in this game.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
There's a plugin for hide and seek.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Is there actually?

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
That's so smart.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Maybe next stream I'll get the plugin and we'll see how it works.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
I don't know.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Hide and seek.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I'd rather lose.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.000
But every time I find you, all you hear is plop, plop, plop.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
And then move on to the next refund.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Plop, plop, plop.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
It's over.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Okay.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
We need to put the hedge on the coffin.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000
And all is good.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
We're going to use the skull on the coffin.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Use it on the coffin.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
It's not a...

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Oh, cut scene.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Release.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Thank you, stranger.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Yeah.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Oh, he's away.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Oh, he's in the water.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Oh, he's had enough.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
He's in the water.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Whoa, we got one cave prayer for that.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
That was actually pretty big.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Right, we've got four quest points now.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Jeez, we've got nine prayers.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
What?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
And I'm level four combat currently.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I didn't fight anything, though.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Hide and plop.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Yes, hide and plop.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
I want to find hide and plop.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Good.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Release.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Oh, that's a lot.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Everyone's leveling up.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Rep sleeping viewers.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Yeah, sorry.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Hopefully no one actually uses this to sleep, too.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I wonder if there's also a kumbor.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Right, what's the easiest quest next?

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Or are we actually going to have to level up?

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I think we might have to get stronger because everything's like...

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Maybe Goblin Village?

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
If we buy everything in advance for that Goblin quest,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I forgot the name of it.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Romeo and Juliet is good.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Should we try Romeo and Juliet?

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Romeo and Juliet.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Also an amulet that's useful for the future, right?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Stronghold of security time?

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I've never done that one.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Romeo and Juliet is no needed stats.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Okay, we're going to do that one then.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I can start this quest by talking to Romeo and Varrock Square.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Who the heck?

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Oh, that's a big walk.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Not going to lie.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
That's like really far away.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Not going to lie.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Okay, we cross the bridge,

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.000
and then we just keep going all the way up to Varrock.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000
I've already lost where Romeo is.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Oh, he's literally in the square of Varrock.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Well, we don't have teleport stone,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
so we're going to have to do it the old fashioned way.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:39.000
I heard it drops the goal in the amulet.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I don't know what that is.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Follow, someone says follow.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Just...

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Oh, oh, taxi!

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Okay, follow the guy with the magma cape.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Wait, make sure we get out of the graveyard first

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
because we might actually get stuck on the gravestones.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Yeah, you'll get...

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Careful, you'll get stuck on the gravestones.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Okay, if you're going to tax sales,

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
can I make a cup of tea?

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Am I allowed to make a cup of tea?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
That little voice is getting sore.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000
This is a magma cape, winky.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
It is!

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Isn't that a magma cape?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Whoa, what is that?

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Wait, you got a special accolade?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Is that a special accolade to this thing?

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Oh, it's a fire cape.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I mean, it looks like magma lava,

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
so whoever named it is wrong.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
We...

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
We must go directly into the dark mages.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Oh, wait, I can't make a cup of tea

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
because I'm going to get hurt by the mages.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
For the weaker reeflings,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
we're about to pass some wizards

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
outside of a rock that will attack us.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
We need to be ready to run.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Go west near the farm.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Oh, he says he's going to go around.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I think we have enough people to kill the dark wizards.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Oh, can I go quickly make a cup of tea, then?

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Watching strongy stream?

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Whenever I read the last thingy,

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
you know the love heart?

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
You can put a love heart on stream.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Tap that love heart thing.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
It's in the way if I read the most bottom thing.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
It says, watching strongy stream is the type of accolade.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Yeah, if you tap that heart,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I can see when you tap it,

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
but it blocks the last message.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I'll be doing nothing but laughing if anyone dies.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Oh, we'll also be at the bank,

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
so is that reefling still there to trade the fish?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Plenty more fish.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I can only see it on mobile.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Yeah, I can see someone make a flush face smiley reaction.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
It's in the way for everyone.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Okay, right.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I was going to say, because it's in the way.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Whenever I read the most bottom message,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000
it's in the way.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
That cape requires you to kill a level 700 monster.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Unless you guys can carry me through that monster,

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I don't think we can do that.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I've never done it before.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Yeah, I had to nuke the heart with an edlocker.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I think you can toggle it away.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Yeah, I have to scroll around it.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
It's a solo fight?

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Well, I'm never getting that.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I am here with the fish.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Okay, we will be going next to the bank,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.000
so we should be okay.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I think.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Is there any?

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Hopefully, there's not too many.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Oh, yeah.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Good idea to go to the bushes first.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Oh, no, these reeflings.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Oh, no, don't get stuck on the wall, reefling.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
These are reeflings.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Oh, no, I don't know if that's everything.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
I might just be someone.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
There's three dots at the top of chat.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
No, no, I think it's okay.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
I think it's there.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Fire cape would be fun.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Oh, no, I don't even know how to do that.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I don't even know how prayer pots work in, like,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000
strength potions and all of that work,

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
and it's, like, all temporary,

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000
but they're, like, a thousand, and it's so expensive.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Watch out now.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
All right, weaker reeflings.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Get ready.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Get ready, weaker reeflings.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Stronger reeflings.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Beat them up.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Show those wizards.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
We mean freaking...

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
We mean business.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Beat them up, stronger reeflings.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
We'll be...

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
The weaker reeflings are going to stick together.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000
This is the best we can do under the circumstances.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Cut off, Boudin.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Run into the circle reefling.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
No, do not go in that circle.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
These wizards are stinky.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
They're no good, guys.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
He's telling you fevers.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
He's telling you the Fibonacci sequence,

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
because those are fevers.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Okay, I think the reeflings, like,

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
literally eradicate all the wizards for us in a way.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Thank you.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
They're all dead.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Literally just absolutely eradicated them.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I think the funniest thing ever.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Wow.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
How can I tell?

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Whoa, how many quests is there?

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I don't know if we can do all the quests in just a little while.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Right, we're looking for R for Romeo.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Uh-oh.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Uh-oh.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Uh-oh.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Okay.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
We're here.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Right, who's Romeo?

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Oh, Romeo's inside the shop.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Inside the shop with the green windows.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Inside the shop is where Romeo is.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
He thought he could hide from us.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Right, talk to Romeo.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Romeo.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
What?

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
What is to become of me and my darling Juliet?

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I cannot find her anywhere.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Have you seen her?

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Yes, I have seen her, actually.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
At least, I think it was her.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Blonde, a bit stressed.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Golly, yes, yes.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
You make a sense of very interesting.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000
And I'll bet she's a bit of a fox around.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Well, I guess she could be considered attractive.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I'll bet she is.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Woo-hoo.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Sorry, all that jubilation has made me forget what we were talking about.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
You were asking me about Juliet.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
You seem to know her.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Oh, yes, Juliet.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
That fox.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Could you tell her that she is the love of my long?

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000
What?

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
She is the love of my long?

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Rinse, jagged.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
She's the love of my long and that I love to be with her.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
What?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
What?

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Surely you mean she is the love of your life and that you long to be with her?

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Oh, yes, what you said.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Tell her that, it sounds much better.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Oh, you're so good at this.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Start the Romeo and Juliet quest.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Yeah, okay, I'll let her know.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Oh, great, and tell her that I want to kiss her a give.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000
You mean you want to give her a kiss?

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Oh, you are good, you are good.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.000
I see I've picked a true professional.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Is he drunk?

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Okay, thanks.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Yay!

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Okay, has everyone got the quest?

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
We now need to...

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Actually, we're going to very quickly go to the bank

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
and I'm going to young call the fish from your juicy, juicy donations to me.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Okay.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Oh, wait, sorry, sorry, wait, wait, wait.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Pause, pause.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000
I'm in the square, I'm in the square.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to run away so quickly.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
We're going to very quickly go to the Grand Exchange

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
because I'm going to empty my inventory

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
and if you want to give me anything, you can, okay?

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000
But I'll...

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Uh, no, don't give me a bond.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I've already bought premium, thank you so much.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Don't give me a bond though, I bought premium.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Right, Reflings, if you want to follow me,

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000
we're going to go to the Grand Exchange.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:54.000
So if you want to give me anything, you can.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Get your scam messages ready.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Oh no, I need to mute public chat whilst we're here.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I might need to mute public chat.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I don't know how bad the bots are going to be.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I have no idea how bad the bots are going to be.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I might have to mute public chat until we go away.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Buying girlfriend through...

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Oh, there's like the bots aren't talking.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Okay, nothing's happening.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Right, I'm going to put...

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I'm literally...

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Oh no, no, I don't want to sell them.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I'm just literally going to shove everything in the bank.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Uh, I think I'll just drop the clue scroll.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Ah, you know what?

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I'll just put it in the bank.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
It doesn't make a difference.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Put all my coins in.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000
I've got an antique lamp.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I don't know what that does.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Oh, I can't put it away.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Uh, I'll rub the antique lamp.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Oh!

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Um, into kicking please.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Hey, 300 XP in kicking.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Yay!

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Okay, I'm level 7.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Cooking now feels good, man.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Stand over here.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
If you want to trade me, you're more than welcome to.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I'm literally starting a farm for, uh...

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
How do I accept, accept?

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Okay, there we go.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Sorry, sorry, I'm dumb.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Oh my gosh, that's a lot of fish.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Oh, a 10 million?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Are you crazy?

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Isn't that a lot of money?

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Are you sure?

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
That's a lot of money.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Oh wait, did I just accept you as a friend by accident?

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Whoops.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.000
10 million reeflings.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Is this account going to get shot down?

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Because, like, Jagex are going to be like,

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
you're clearly, like, paying for these?

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
I got lobster!

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I'm cake!

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Yes!

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Thank you for the lobster!

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Oopsie.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000
The weapon is 1.2 billion?

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000
That's crazy.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Sorry, I think I accidentally added a frame.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000
10 million?

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Isn't that not, like, a...

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
How much, how much ink?

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
How much ink?

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
1,000 crusty socks?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Why did Jagex make that item?

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
They knew exactly what they were doing.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Doubling money!

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000
This shmuck just made 10 million.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Doubling money, doubling money.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
That's ridiculous.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
On the contrary, we play here.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Oh, it's a ring!

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Oh, can I wear it?

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Am I allowed to put it on?

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
It's a diamond reefling!

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Oh, my God.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Wait, wait.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Can I see it on my finger if I put it on?

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
No, I didn't change my persons.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I'm married to the reeflings.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
He he he he he.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Okay, what do we do on the wedding then?

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
What's the honeymoon?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000
I want to know about the honeymoon.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Fishies!

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Oh, we are going to be, like, exploding.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Oh, my God, that's so much.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000
We are going to be exploding once we cook all these.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Thank you, reeflings.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Oh, my gosh.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Okay, I'm going to put it all in the bank,

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.000
and then we get to come back.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Come back.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
There's not one single bot here.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
That's pretty thingy.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Okay, we are doing Romeo and Juliet.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Do we need to do anything?

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
We actually don't need any items at all.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Wow.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Oh, sorry.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Sorry, there's a few more that wish to trade.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
My apologies.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
My apologies.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Fishies!

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Look at all the fishies.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
You can bank note these, by the way.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
But thank you for the fishies.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
We're getting so much fish.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Yes, thank you.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Okay, how do I accept this?

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Oh, I'm getting grapes.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Hey, yo, you want to grape me?

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Hold on a minute.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Oh, no, sorry.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000
The cut of our berries.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000
My apologies.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
My apologies.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000
It's a wedding gift.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Who did I not accept the trade from?

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Is it you?

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Did I accept the trade from you?

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
God, great.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Wait, does Johnny come in tax fraud and runescape?

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Honestly?

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Oopsie, sorry.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Oh, wait, hold on.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
I accidentally added a reefling.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I apologize.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Sorry.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
It's just because it was show.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
What's the dress going to look like?

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Someone called Sweaty Socks.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Are you role-playing as my Sweaty Socks?

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I actually have socks on.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Oh, it's a necklace.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
It's so pretty.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Oh, they get to put it on.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Amulet of power.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Oh, check me out.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Oh, look at that little thing.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
This puppet that you get to hurry.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
When we celebrate in the wedding

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
on my alternative Twitter.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Eat cuttlefish.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Whatever, you name yourself like that.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Unless you mean the other way.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
What, you got to show me what you've got?

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Eat cuttlefish.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
You know what?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Are you just going to...

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Hi, Johnny, sounding beautiful as ever.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Are you declined it?

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Right, I will put this away in the bank.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
And then we will finish

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Gnotic and Elf and Gnotic and Oblin.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Wait, why is that not doing all...

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
There we go.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Oh, that's all I needed to do.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Speaking of alt-Twitters.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.000
What was your reaction to them blown up?

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
So, Mercy stumbled upon the algorithm.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And then Sheebie did it.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
But I did mine too late, Rip.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
But, I mean, the video did really well.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
It got like a hundred and...

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
A thousand likes on it.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
And you're really good.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Wait, are you trying again?

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Did you get stage fright?

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Or is that the other one?

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Right, Gnome, Gnotic and Elf and Gnotic and Oblin.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
We need to Gnotic and Elf to over to Gnor.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
To Faldor, I think.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
I think she's somewhere here.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
I don't know where she is.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Talk to Romeo, I did.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Did I not accept?

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Talk to Romeo, I did.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Talk to Juliet in the house west of Viroc.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Oh wait, they're both in Viroc?

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Why did I think she was in Faldor?

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
And where is Gnotic and Oblin?

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
I'm analising.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
I'm analising.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Oh!

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Eh?

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
She's here?

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Why would you be in there?

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Okay.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Alright, let's go to the front of the Grand Exchange

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
for my little refillings, front of the Grand Exchange,

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
front centre.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
After this quest, I am going to...

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Faldor?

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I hardly even know her.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Thank you, thank you.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I came up with that myself, thank you.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Refillings, I'm at the front of the Grand Exchange.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
You can find me over here.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
So we're making a clan.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Can you make a clan?

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Like, can anyone make a clan?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
That video was amazing.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
All per eco fish just wanted to feel included in it.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
It got none to thingy.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
A luring clan, he even knows.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Okay, is this all my refillings?

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
We're at the front?

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Okay, this looks like great.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Ready?

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Atten!

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Up!

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Two, three, four.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Up!

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Two, three, four.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
How do I get in this house?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
It looks like I get in this door here.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Unless there's another door.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000
No, there's a door here.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Okay, we just used this door.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Literally right over there.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Hut!

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Two, three, four.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Hit!

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Two, three, four.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Mine is too bad joke, literally.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Just going down ten aura, sorry.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Okay, open the door.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Hello, we would like to come inside your house.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Don't mind us, we're just...

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
How have I come the hardest way to get around this house?

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
There's no way!

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
I literally picked the most awkward door.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
I'm so sorry!

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:08.000
We literally have trailed through the entire house, but the one door.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Stop pranking each other with the door!

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
You're pranking me with the door!

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Why is there a fisherman?

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
It's a true draw party!

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Get your truck, get your truck, get your truck.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
We're going to need it.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
We're going to need all the XP.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I got three, four, five, six.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
I don't know how I managed to do the worst.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Right, go up the stairs.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Up the stairs.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
It smells fishy in here.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
It does.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Right, where's Juliet?

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Oh, her room's all pink.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Oh my God, you're such a girl.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
How do we know Juliet's a girl?

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Hmm, it's a mystery.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Hi Juliet.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Juliet, I've come from Romeo.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:46.000
He begs me to tell you that he cares still.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Oh how my heart soars for hearing this news.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Please take this message to him with great haste.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Well, I hope it's good news.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
He was quite upset when I left him.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.000
He's quite often upset at the poor sensitive soul,

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000
but I don't think he's going to take this news very well.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
However, all is not lost.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Everything is explained in the letter.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Would you be so kind to deliver it to him, please?

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Certainly, I'll do so straight away.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Many thanks.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Oh, I'm so very grateful.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
You may be our only hope.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000
You're my only hope.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Okay, as everyone spoke to Juliet,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Romeo and Juliet, we're just literally passing

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
sextant messages, honestly.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
What's going on here?

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
If you have spoken to Juliet,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
we can go back doing the stairs,

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
and we're going to go back to Romeo.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Oh, Romeo, where are for thou art Romeo?

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Oi, who closed that door?

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
I literally just smacked my face.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000
My, I freaking, you closed that door,

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
and now I'm tracking outside backwards.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Stop it.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Don't, don't close the door.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
You made me whack my face into it.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Stop it.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Let me out of this house.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
It keeps trying to make me go.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Right, I'm out.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I'm out.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Okay, we're safe.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
We're safe.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.000
You don't want to go through the five doors instead, honestly.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Forget doing agility training.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
It's hard enough to get out of a door

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
that someone else is closing.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
What?

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
How did that pop up?

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I didn't even accept.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Okay, our all reflings here.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
We're going to go back to Romeo.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
He's this way.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Hardest boss in the game, pathing.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Yeah.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Are we refling back there?

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Dear Mario, please come to the castle.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Oh, did I tell you I really like this meme?

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Dear Mario, please don't come to the castle.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I've baked a cake.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
It's absolutely dark shit.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000
I love that meme so much.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Okay, we go talk to Romeo back in the green shop.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Why is that green?

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Oh, cloth right.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Which one did that?

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Stop.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Stop it.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Stop.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Right, I'm in.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Who did that?

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Was that you?

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Was that you?

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
You're the one who's right behind the door.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
I love Mummy.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Am I accusing you live?

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Was that you?

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I don't know who did that.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
I don't know who did that.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Talk to Romeo.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Romeo, great news.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000
I've been in touch with Big Juliet.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
She's written a message for you.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
You hand over the message.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Oh, a message.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
A message.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I've never had a message before.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Really?

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
No, no, no.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Not one.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Well, except for the occasional court summon.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
But the really, really nice message.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Not like this one.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I'm sure this message will be lovely.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Yes, yes.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Where are you?

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Well, are you going to open it or not?

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Oh, yes.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Yes, of course.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Yes, of course.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Affection.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000
She thinks I'm deceased.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Oh, affliction.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Oh, I can't read.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Sorry.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
I'm not going to get my glasses on.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Sorry.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
It says affliction.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Affection.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Oh, wait.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
No, I got it right.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Affection.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Oh, yes.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Still hold affection for me.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
I still feel great affection for you.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Unfortunately, my father opposes our marriage.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Oh, dear.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
That doesn't sound too good at all.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I want great affection for you.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Father opposes our marriage.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:28.000
And well, we'll kill you if he sees you again.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I'm going to be honest.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
It's not getting any better, me.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Our only hope is that the father Lawrence, a long time confidant,

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
can help us in some way.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Romeo folds the message away.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Well, that's it then.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
We haven't got a chance.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
What about Father Lawrence?

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Our love is over the great romance that'll life of my love.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Or you could speak to Father Lawrence.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Oh, my aching, breaking heart.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Oh, how useless the situation is now.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I've got no one to turn to.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Father Lawrence.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Father Lawrence.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Oh, yes, Father Lawrence.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
He's a long time confidant.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
He might have a solution.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Yes, yes.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
You have to go and talk to Father Lawrence for once

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000
and ask him if he's got any suggestion for a predicament.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Where can I feign Father Lawrence?

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Lawrence, Father Lawrence.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Oh, you know, he's not my real father, don't you?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I think I suspected that he wasn't.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Did he get hit on the head?

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Well, anyway, he tells his songs,

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:52.000
luring bare moans and keep these here.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
What? I can't even read that.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Yeah, okay, thanks.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Okay, thanks.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Yeah, thanks mate.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Nice try on the English, but even I can't read that.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Where the heck are we going? Somewhere over here.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000
He's just a, and then dot, dot, dot.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000
I don't know what you typed, Reefling.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Are you trying to say he's one of us?

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
For that word, he's one of us.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
No one slammed the door.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I slammed my piece.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Okay, Reeflings, we're going a little to the left

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
outside that shop.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Any Reeflings left behind?

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000
There's one Reefling.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Yay.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I don't think these are all NPCs.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I love Reefling there.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I didn't close the door, but I'm ready to accept

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
any punishment you do with it.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Captain Jack Thornbare.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Okay, let's go.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
We are just following the path.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
I see the blue marker because of rune light,

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
so we're just following that.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
But, oh no!

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Oh no, I'm going to get you strapped on the fence.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000
I'm sorry.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I was a bit, I was a bit preemptive.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Okay, okay, that was lucky.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Easy, take it easy, easy.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Let's not get any Reeflings caught on a fence.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Come on.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:58.000
We can do it.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.000
I have no idea how.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Oh, here's the church.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Right, we're going to go to the steps over here.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Rare correct path, I think, honestly.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Going to Wildy Ditch.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Should we start attacking each other?

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Should we do fisty cuffs?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Should we do fisty cuffs in Wildy

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
and just start beating each other up

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
until there's a crowned Reefling at the end?

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000
And then I give you a rose as a favour

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.000
because you're the knight that stood against all Reeflings.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
And...

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
And lutes are domain, like the way for you.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Oh, I was in the middle of a ceremony.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
But Romeo sent me.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
But I'm busy delivering in a ceremony to my congregation.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Ah, yes.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000
It certainly seems like you have a captive audience.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Okay, okay, what do you want?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.000
So I can get rid of you and continue with my ceremony.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Romeo sent me?

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
He says you've been able to help?

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Ah, Romeo, yes.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000
A fine land, but he's a wee bit confused.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Very confused.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Anyway, Romeo wishes to be married to Julia.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
She must be rescued from her father's control.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I agree, and I think I have an idea.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
A potion to make her dad...

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Oh, to appear passed away.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Dead!

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Sounds a bit creepy to me, but please continue.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
The potion will only make Julia yet appear dead.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Then she will be taken to the crypt.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Crypt!

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Again, we're getting a bit creepy, mate.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
You must have some strange hobbies.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
That's what the berries someone gave me.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Apart from...

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Did that refling want me to be asleep?

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Or did you want to be asleep?

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Okay, reflings!

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Once you have...

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Why does someone have a...

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Someone has a prayer on?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Don't leave it on.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
You've got a prayer on.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
You're going to run out of prayer.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Also, someone get fond of the potion!

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
That's terrible.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Guys, you're putting your prayer on.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000
You're going to run out of prayer.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Literally, I only have nine prayer points.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Right, everyone outside the church.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Con-

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Mass is over.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Congrats on finishing Mass.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
You just have a lot of fun.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Where are we going?

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Oh, that's cool.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Oh, you can't see because of my hair.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
All right, you can kind of see it.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.000
See how the bar is like...

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Oh, you're getting close to being finished.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
That's new.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
I don't remember that.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Where are we heading?

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Where are we heading?

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Whoa!

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Where am I?

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
No?

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Can I please go back to the surface?

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Thank you.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Where do we need to go?

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
I'm looking...

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Oh, there is...

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Still in the same town.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Thank goodness.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Okay.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I'll just follow the HUD for the most part.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Oh, you wished to trade with me.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000
I will accept your trade.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
What do you offer me?

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
What do you offer me?

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Oh!

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
You've rejected!

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.000
How dare you!

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Oh, no.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
I had to do with a friend.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Sorry.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
I keep freaking adding people as a friend by accident.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Oh, wait.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Hold on.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000
I need to remove you.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I'm dying.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Delete.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Rip.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
One tick.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Player.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Flick.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000
One tick flicking on Romeo and Juliet Quest.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
True gamers here, honestly.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
I wish I understood the tick mechanic.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I've heard it explained so many times to me.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000
I don't get it.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I don't get it.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I'm practicing.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Literally.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Oh, there's like little birds making noises in the game.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Is this the actual priestess...

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Crickets, please.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000
What?

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:49.000
You want me to just play?

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:54.000
I'll just play crickets right now, even though you asked for it like five minutes ago.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Oh, it's this shop.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Okay.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
What are we doing over here?

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I thought it was only in the day that I remember Scotland.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I'm like, I can be out until like 9.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000
It's summer.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.000
When it's summer in Scotland, the sun doesn't go away until like 9.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000
It's pretty bright.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Oh, no.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.000
I'm closing the door.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Okay.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
I thought I was closing the door, but I'm not.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Okay.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Let's talk.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I am apocrity.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
I broke potions.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Do you need anything?

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Yes.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
I do need something very specific about Romeo and Juliet.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Wait.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Wasn't there a movie called Romeo and Juliet?

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
And it was about nose.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.000
What do these berries look like?

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Wait.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.000
We need berries.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Oh, no.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Someone gave me berries.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Okay.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I guess we will get the berries.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Um, to the Grand Exchange Reeflings, we will go obtain some berries.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Oh, I can't get out because someone closed the door.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000
I clicked on the map to get out.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Someone's closing the door.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I can't get out of that room.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
I'm not stuck in there.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Yeah.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
My hand hurts after a few minutes of it.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Oh, you can only last a few minutes now?

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000
One handed?

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Right.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Let's go get some berries.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Secret berries.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I thought it said I didn't need anything.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000
It said recommended items.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.000
None.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.000
It says bring.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
You can pick some from the bushes.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Oh, we're to pick them from the bushes.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I'm sorry.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I apologize.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Where's the bushes?

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Bring.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Talk.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.000
I've just read it.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Bring.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Nope.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
I just read where I can pick the bushes.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
You can pick some bushes southeast of Iraq.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Wait.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Where am I supposed to go then?

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:39.000
What's southeast?

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Southeast?

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Like over here?

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Feels like I can get stabbed in these back alleys.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
You can pick my dingo, but...

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Send!

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000
We're trying to find a freaking bush.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Yeah, done.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Yeah, done.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.000
I didn't tell you my short caller arrived for our streaming app.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Where are the berries?

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Pass the dark wizard.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Okay.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Strong reeflings, please go ahead and beat the absolute crap out of those dark wizards.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
For weaker reeflings, get ready.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Prepare thyself.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Where are these berries?

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I'm looking.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Oh my god, the reeflings are just absolutely going to town on them.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
All the magic noises.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Oh!

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Yes!

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
The bushes are ahead.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Fragile and weak, please handle me with care.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Trying to find strongies bushes then.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Right.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I'm going to say something.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I'm going to say something controversial.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I was going to make a here ASMR, like here sounds, but it was rather, rather different.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Okay.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Right.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
I've got berries.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Everyone, everyone collect your berries off the bushes.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Has everyone got a berry?

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:05.000
It looks like they're infinite spawn bushes actually, so.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Wait, did bots run these berries?

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Wait, it's cost 400 GP for these berries?

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Have we just stumbled on a money maker?

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Here ASMR, not controversial.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000
How would that even work?

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.000
I would place the microphone at hips level.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:28.000
I've been here for two seconds and you're already getting controversial.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.000
I can't.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.000
You show up in it.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Right.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I think everyone's got it.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Yeah.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000
These berries are bought and free to play world smothers with your hair.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Next winning strat in GG.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Okay.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Let's go past the wizards again.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Stronger leaflings.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000
You know the drill.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Has everyone got a berry?

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.000
400 GP.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Oh my God.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:49.000
That's huge.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Interest on the 10 million GP.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.000
True.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
True.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
10 million GP investment.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Beat them up.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Beat them up.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Show them who's boss.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Oh, that red bead is worth so much money.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Oh, that refling got it.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Oh, no.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Take this bead.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
I got it.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
I got it.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Wow.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Wizard hats are 1,000 money.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Why is it so much money?

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
We should be killing these wizards over and over again.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Okay.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I'm going to get out of here before we're getting trouble.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I don't want the wizards to spawn and start getting us.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Stronger leaf, we're doing this one.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Can we have a reward that lets us see the stream stingers?

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Stop.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:31.000
I've literally not even put them on.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I just realized I've not even shown you what my stream stingers look like.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:42.000
That's terrible.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:43.000
That's terrible.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Literally like, what did reflings look like?

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
And I'm like, what do you mean?

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I've already shown you what reflings look like in the artwork.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:50.000
We've got stingers either.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
And I don't even use my loading screen.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000
And I spent like 600 US dollars on it.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I'm like, genuinely such a bad vtuber.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000
But I just want to jump in the game.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Who did that?

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Who did that?

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Who did that?

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I managed to somehow get past.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Alright, Romeo and Juliet.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Well done.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.000
You have the berries.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I do.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Okay.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Oh, he's apocratizing.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000
He's apocratizing all over the place.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:19.000
I'm going to smack the plan.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Bring the potion to Juliet.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Okay.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
I'm going to stand outside and wait for everyone to get out.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Because you already know what's going to happen.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
And you're always going to freaking smack everyone's face.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Strongest seat is a moneymaker.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Who said that?

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Oh.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Okay, wait until the other reflings are ready.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I'm mousin' all over the refling.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I'm mousin' all over you.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Are you like that?

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Oh, I got that.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Mousin' all over me.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
I'm just mousin' all over you.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Watch out for Viralt Guards.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
No, Virat.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Doubt these potions are illegal.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
I haven't made any money though.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Drink the potion for a funny thing.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Oh, I don't want to drink it.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000
I'd have to go get another thing again.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Does it make you pass out?

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Viralt Guards don't get paid enough to care about that.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Honestly, $1 million donation reward.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Use stream startin' screen once for 10 seconds.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Bravo, honestly.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.000
It's been $600, $800-ish.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Okay, is that one more refling?

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Oh, we're all level six now or something?

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Whoa, that's a lot of refling.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Well, no, refling.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Or are you not done the quest properly?

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Or is this...

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000
You've got a chef's hat on, which makes me think you're a refler.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.000
What are the odds that someone just happens to be doing the quest at the same time?

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
When are we going to winter town?

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.000
I've literally never done any event in RuneScape

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
because I'm just so bad at it and I don't understand.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
I know that because I had to hunt it down

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.000
to get a refler shop for the fan art.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Oh, watch it mostly shine.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
I didn't even know stingers were a thing.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
So everyone got a logo stinger

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
and everyone got an artwork stinger.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I need a moment of time.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Oh, someone wants to trade.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Except your trade.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000
What do you offer me?

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Ah!

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Okay.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
I'll accept.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I did say I wanted your ink, okay?

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000
I got you.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Yeah.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Right, we're going to hand over the potion to Julia.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Winter tot is where the yarrow...

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Literally, that's why I'm like winter fell in Skyrim.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
That's where the yarrow live.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Right, we're going to open the door for everyone.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Yarrow ballroom.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.000
These here.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Oh, I'm going to close the door back.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Okay, let's get inside the house, please.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Get inside the house.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Get up the stairs.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Anyway, if I catch any refling closing doors...

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Something bad's going to happen.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000
I don't know.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
I'm not decided on the punishment yet.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Your stream starting soon is very beautiful.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Yes, but it's very...

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
As well.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Oh, sorry.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I have a Kandava potion here.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Suggested by Father Lawrence, if you...

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Oh, wait, that's me.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Excuse me, sorry, I don't know where that voice came from.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Have a Kandava potion here. Suggested by Father Lawrence.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.000
If you drink it, it will make you appear dead.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Yes?

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
And when you appear dead,

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.000
you're still in lifeless corpse will be removed from the crypt.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Oh, a cold, dark, creepy crypt.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Sounds just peachy.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Then Romeo can steal...

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
And...

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Let's just steal into the crypt and rescue you just as you wake up.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.000
And this is a great idea for getting me out of here.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
To be fair, I can't take all the credit.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:53.000
In fact, it was all Father Lawrence's suggestion.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Okay, if this is the best we can do, then hand over that potion.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
You pass the suspicion potion to Juliet.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Wonderful.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Wonderful, I just thought Romeo could remember to get me from the crypt.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Why do I feel like we're about to bust her out of the crypt?

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Please go to Romeo and make sure you understand the lie of his...

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:17.000
His gormless, love-lorn, soppy ways.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
He can be a bit dense sometimes and I don't want to wake...

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
And I want to wake up in the crypt on my own.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Yeah, we're definitely picking up the crypt.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Here it is.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Oh, he...

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Here's Philippine, my cousin, she's in...

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
She's in on the plot too.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000
She's going to make it seem like it's more convincing.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Yes, I'm quick.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Ah.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000
What's a British boy?

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000
He's quick, British, quick.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Nick-a-car.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Yes, I'm quite an actress.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Good luck, dear cousin.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Right, bottoms up.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Oh, she's Paris.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Oh, no.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Juliet has died.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:59.000
You may be more believable if you're not smiling when you see it.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Oh, yeah.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
You might be right.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Oh, no, no, no.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Let's try that again.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Try that again.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Oh, no.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Juliet's dead.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000
I can't do, like, three different accents at one time.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Perhaps a bit louder, like, you're upset, you know, that your cousin just died.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Right, yeah, okay.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Nick-a-car.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Okay, I think I'm getting the motivation now.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Okay, let's just try this again.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Oh, no.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Juliet's dead.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Oh, no.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Oh, no.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Juliet, my poor dead cousin.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Oh, this was not a lot of screaming.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Oh, you cunt, she's dead.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Oh, poor Juliet.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I made preparations for her body to be blessed with the crypt.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
This is terrible.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I don't know where that came from.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Right, okay.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Where do we go next?

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Bring...

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Talk to Romeo and Varric Square to finish the quest.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.000
All right.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.000
That man was Cornel Sanders.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:58.000
How am I getting door blocked?

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.000
How have they not figured out this freaking door block, honestly?

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Stop!

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Right, I just went through that door.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
That's how strong I am.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
I just went through that door.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Okay.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Let's go to Romeo.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Where everyone...

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Right, I'll wait outside.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Father noticed that a random person handed her a potion and she perished, literally.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Oh, no.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Juliet.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
You're dead.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:24.000
No.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
I say no.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Follow the cute face.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Any cute fishers?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Any cute fishermen coming to hook her?

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Yee.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Quite the hooker.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Hey.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Yeah.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Oh.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Yo-ho.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I assume everyone got out.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Yeah, the door's been left open.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.000
That's how I know all the reeflings are available.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Oh, there's two doors to this place.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Okay, we'll go in this room.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Oh, I now understand people are in their angular gear.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
I saw that.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
Who's that shadowed guy?

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000
I saw that.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:06.000
You literally are making us walk all the way around because you closed that fecking door.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.000
I saw that.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.000
I literally saw that in 4K.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
It's you.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.000
It's the freaking shadow one.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Who's your name?

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Identify yourself.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Bye.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:23.000
More like slamming to a door.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Romeo, it's all set.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Juliet has dropped the potion.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Ah, great.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
The potion.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Great.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:29.000
What potion would that be then?

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.000
The kind of a potion.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
You know, the one which will make her appear dead.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000
She's in the crepe.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Pop along and clean your true love.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.000
But I'm scared.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Will you come with me?

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Yeah, I knew we were going to come with you.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Oh, come on.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I just saw the entrance when I visited there last.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Stranny, you have hooked me.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000
What voice did I give him?

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Oh, this is pretty scary.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
I would be quiet.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Oh, he's got flowers.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Oh my god, cut scene.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Look, we're here.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Look, Juliet's over there.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Oh, there she is.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
I don't remember doing this quest, honestly.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:09.000
I think I'll confuse it with Goblin Mail one.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Go over to her and I'll go wait over here.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Okay, then.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Yeah, just go.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:23.000
She's fine.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Hey, Juliet.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Juliet.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Oh, dear.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:31.000
You seem to be dead.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:34.000
What voice did I give her?

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Oh, Romeo.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I'm Philippa.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Oh, wow.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
You're a fox.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.000
It's a shame about Juliet, but perhaps we can meet up later.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Who's Juliet?

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Wait, what?

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
That's it?

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
What?

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:56.000
What?

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Hello?

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
I didn't wait, so she's actually dead.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Did we actually kill her?

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Oh, no.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
That's really sad.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I actually feel really bad.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I don't remember that.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Father Lawrence messed it all up.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
We just poisoned an innocent woman.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Wait, we're go check.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Wait, we'll go to her house to see if she's there because what?

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
That was a method.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Right, we're going back to the house because what?

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Juliet in shambles, literally.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:36.000
She's selling her stonks.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
That was crazy.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Right, the door's still open.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Surely.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Surely there will be no shenanigans at this door.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
She's fine.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Is she actually?

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Let's get inside.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Let's inside.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Inside.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
There we go.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:02.000
You got there in the end.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:03.000
You just need a little guidance.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.000
I suppose you're quite pleased with yourself now.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Wait, why?

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Juliet?

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:16.000
She's literally getting ran through about yourself.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.000
What did she say?

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.000
I sat in that cold crib for ages waiting on Romeo.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
That useless fool never showed up.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
And all I got was indigestion.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:26.000
I'm done with men like him.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Now go away before I call my father.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Oh, can I play piano?

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Oh, I wish you could play piano.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
That'd be kind of cool though.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.000
That's so bad.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Wait, why can't I go through that door?

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
That's actually really sad.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:42.000
I feel kind of bad though.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Sorry, Juliet.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000
We didn't mean that.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000
I'm sorry.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Stop!

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
I'm getting locked in again.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Actually getting soft locked in my video game.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Okay, I am going to make a cup of tea and call a pee break.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
And then we're...

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Are we got enough level, like enough skill level now that anyone can like trade?

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Is nine quest points enough?

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:07.000
I think we were going to do some quick fissure.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Fissure on.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Pee break, finally.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Let's just name a preview.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
All of yous have been needing a pee for ages.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:14.000
A wee break.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:15.000
A piddle break, if you will.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Oh my god.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Yeah, what do you want to give me?

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Oh, a beer and a kebab.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Are you asking for a drunk stream soon?

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Because don't think I won't do that.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Don't think I won't give the people what they want.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Thank you very much.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Okay.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Oh wait, is that going to log me out and then you can all see what my freaking email is?

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I will turn...

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.000
I will hide the game off a screen.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
But I might have to log back in again.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.000
No, let's game audio.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Hold on.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Game chat, donations.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
In game?

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.000
No.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Right.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
I'm going to do that just in case because I don't know if it's going to show.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
You can set it to 25 minutes.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Oh, I've not set it.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Okay.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Give me like three minutes.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.000
I'm going to pee.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
I'm going to make a cup of tea.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I do recommend you get up, stretch your legs, get some water and then we are going to do

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
actual cooking.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
We're going to do actual cooking now, I think.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Because we've hit the quest point thing.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:18.000
I don't know.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
But okay.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Give me...

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Let me cook for like three minutes and by cook, I mean let me boil a freaking a kettle.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Okay.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Right.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
I will be a moment.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Okay.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Three minutes.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Go for a go for a tinkle-winkle.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Okay.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Okay.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Okay.

did it in my childhood and then we'll change to whatever the most like fastest method is okay

02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:15.480
so everyone teleport to Lumbridge we are doing it the way this is how I used to do it as a child

02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:22.520

what is that refling doing that oh my god that bot just ran off so we're gonna fish until

02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:09.800
our inventories fill and then I'm gonna chop down one of those trees and we're all gonna

02:53:09.800 --> 02:53:15.240
cook around the fire together and we're all gonna share little stories when we cook our food like

02:53:15.240 --> 02:53:21.960
like what people do in communities and stuff so who's gonna be the I'll be the fire master okay

02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:29.880
and this batch of fish we're gonna talk I forgot the net I told you to bring it now the only thing

02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:34.840
about fishing is that it all expires so you have to move to the next tail this is to prevent

02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:40.120
and hashtag and quotation marks this is to prevent oh hold on I'm calibrating

02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:47.240
did it calibrate yeah calibrate I'm level fishing too

02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:54.520
oh the the trainer guy should give you a free net hopefully what is that

02:53:55.720 --> 02:53:59.720
so we're yeah we just doing this and we're gonna cook the fishy and then

02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:04.040

03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:52.440
I've got food in my tum tum I've got a honey tea that can't wait getting a promotion from

03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:57.960
each of our boss calls in on the office you're all she is based technically you're also playing

03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:03.320
runescape at work off I wouldn't he say streamings work honestly I'd say the only time it feels

03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:09.080
like work is if I have to prepare like maybe like for the game shows and stuff level nine by the way

03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:15.160
that's right read him and wait for level nine boss calls you in the office and says he's watching

03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:24.040
scrawny too runescape takes no focus though okay and now I am going to hold shift and drop all

03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:30.440

I am beautiful I actually got that that was so good right hopefully my email address didn't show up

03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:33.480
I hate that's just how it is right oh there we go got it right and then we go back to fishing

03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:42.520
because we're only level 99 I'm gonna check the chart view cooking gates we can do meat chicken

03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:48.440
and all that trout is 15 which is a big start upgrade so I guess we're doing this until 15

03:04:49.080 --> 03:04:53.800
and we're going fishing elsewhere but as we level up we get closer and closer

03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:59.400
oh my god level four fishing not to brag or anything but level four all of us

03:05:04.440 --> 03:05:06.680
I'm pretty close level fishing

03:05:10.280 --> 03:05:14.920
wait what are you doing a command he's tapping a command well got run you catch the shrimp and

03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:22.280
burn them I'll burn them thanks for hanging see when you come back I just I don't know I've not

03:05:22.280 --> 03:05:27.400
decided if it's an endurance right now we're just memeing and dreaming and streaming and fishing

03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:31.080
and then we're fishing and we're cooking and we're cooking and we're fishing

03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:39.080
my mind not working you just gotta trust me for real for real don't worry I do this all the time

03:05:39.960 --> 03:05:49.640
don't worry did you see it what what did I see the toenail wait what did I miss was there

03:05:49.640 --> 03:05:56.440
something on stream I don't see it I see you guys we're all just hanging out

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:10.600
sorry I've got gains to get bye bye I don't think I was a roofland I was

03:06:10.600 --> 03:06:15.000
someone that was interested in what we're doing see how you feel like four is going from there

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:19.400
she literally at the start was no this will not be an endurance human after a few hours she

03:06:19.400 --> 03:06:25.800
doesn't know anymore it's hard just the bots hanging out doing a lot of bot things he wants to

03:06:25.800 --> 03:06:32.040
talk about his cars extended warranty I literally I do not want to talk to you leave me alone old

03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:39.480
man he's getting harassed by an NPC shadow wizard and when you get how how purple are those anchovies

03:06:40.520 --> 03:06:44.600
are shrimpies oh wait anchovies and shrimp are different

03:06:45.240 --> 03:06:53.080
hmm just tip some money for another four hours I'm like a receipt a reciprocal

03:06:53.800 --> 03:06:58.120
a reciprocal Danny you put Danny put text behind my screen

03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:02.680
okay there text doesn't go over me anymore

03:07:05.960 --> 03:07:11.480
oh my god leveling up we're getting them gains I did not realize how slow fishing was to get

03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:12.680
my goodness

03:07:16.920 --> 03:07:24.360
she doesn't want to leave us honestly I like after the so I can apply for monetization I'm

03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:28.760
going to apply after the stream and see what happens I don't know how long it's going to take

03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:38.120
but um tomorrow's ASMR so that's short and then the taste test and stream is short as well

03:07:38.760 --> 03:07:44.600
however it might work out better because if I get monetized then I'm doing my pop-up

03:07:44.600 --> 03:07:50.760
monetization stream surprise thing um I know I'm fishing but there's no fishy

03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:56.360
I wish you good luck on the month yeah basically YouTube just reviews the account and goes yeah

03:07:56.360 --> 03:08:00.600
good to go oh man my bank is locked can you hit me up again in three days

03:08:00.840 --> 03:08:16.520
I don't know what that means back to fishing we're just fishing uh but yes um we're just

03:08:16.520 --> 03:08:24.120
going to level up as much as we can do right now um any ringfoot adventure streams yeah

03:08:25.080 --> 03:08:30.120
100% I absolutely adore love ring uh ringfoot adventure

03:08:31.560 --> 03:08:37.880
and it was really fun as long as it's not dangerous for my car but I'm pretty sure I got

03:08:37.880 --> 03:08:43.560
pretty high last time do you have an idea of how many more watch hours you need oh I made

03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:49.880
watchers the problem was YouTube wasn't updating our stats for one week like the stats are now

03:08:49.880 --> 03:08:58.680
behind one week like it doesn't make sense um so only now I can apply even though after debut

03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:06.360
we had watch time like it's just a bit it's a bit silly but um we're submitting we also think now

03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:13.480
that we have one confirmed like week of stats the culling stops here so you might be unsubscribed

03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:17.800
if you're watching in right now I don't know but don't be afraid to like and subscribe to the stream

03:09:17.880 --> 03:09:26.200
helps out you know that jazz but um we think the culling has stopped so a few ASMR group collabs

03:09:26.200 --> 03:09:33.960
and all that are gonna come out shortly after monetization because the girls some dummy used

03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:39.720
my email to make an account and one of the passwords I use that's just like as great

03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:45.320
names ring fit my blood please don't push yourself too hard like that one time I don't I just really

03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:53.000
enjoyed it but I can't do like subscribe and send your bank card details hell yeah um just thumbs

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:59.560
up right now thank you I don't know why but haven't been subbed on once um maybe it's because I got

03:09:59.560 --> 03:10:05.640
YouTube premium I don't know what caused it because I did get marshmallows that are like no I like

03:10:05.640 --> 03:10:10.600
I straight up gotten subbed by like three of the girls or did this or whatever I don't know if it's

03:10:10.600 --> 03:10:15.560
also related to if you don't watch the girls like shorts or if you don't watch any content but

03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:21.480
subscribe and then peace out then YouTube don't like that and see it as bot activity rather than

03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:25.720
someone subscribing and being like I'll come back later and watch this like not everyone watches YouTube

03:10:25.720 --> 03:10:33.080
shorts um which reminds me I should have sent two shorts to Emmy to review because the editor had

03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:40.520
finished those shorts I'm going to do that after stream and solve by watching everyone

03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:45.800
literally if you put if you watch their shorts or puts like some minutes and a watch time into them

03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:52.920
then I think YouTube doesn't um take you I got unsubbed from some other VTubers pre-davio but

03:10:52.920 --> 03:10:58.520
not from any of the girls good good that's what I like to hear so me subscribing just to support

03:10:58.520 --> 03:11:05.880
is pointless oh no like actual YouTube subscribe is not pointless what happened was the accounts

03:11:05.880 --> 03:11:11.880
were getting called because they were new and for bot protection we were getting wrecked but we

03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:18.120
think now because there's one week of confirmed stats it's over like I don't think we got called

03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:27.640
at all recently like today or when I was asleep so yeah so I think it's only going up from here

03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:32.920
now thankfully I like check the stats of everyone's accounts and we should have been at 5k right now

03:11:32.920 --> 03:11:41.400
but it's okay we'll we'll work back up towards it um yes it's weird I know it's bot protection

03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:49.400
I had never experienced it before and me oh my it was aggressive on us very aggressive but I do

03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:53.800
think it's I genuinely do believe it's over especially once the girls get monetized I don't

03:11:53.880 --> 03:11:59.080
think you experience it as a monetized channel because that just seems a bit odd because they

03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:04.840
know if you're being watched by bots or not so oh my god my mind's are cracking okay I'm gonna

03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:11.560
slip my slip I'm gonna sip my tea please don't do anything to the slit okay

03:12:19.480 --> 03:12:20.040
delicious

03:12:23.880 --> 03:12:26.600
but yes I have a very fun collapse coming out soon TM

03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:39.960
I can't wait YouTube stopped in oh literally it's such a shame I felt so bad for the girls

03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:44.840
because we were like in the discord like oh my god we're at 3000 subscribers oh my god oh my god

03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:51.800
like getting ready to make but like all of us held back from doing a celebration post because it

03:12:51.800 --> 03:13:00.760
just wasn't happening and it was such a shame I do have a special like congrats on 5k for everyone

03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:05.560
posting a 10k and then I don't know what's happening after that if I should order more artwork or not

03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:11.320
the 10k artwork is absolutely gorgeous so I can't wait for everyone to react to it

03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:16.280
but I can't I can't let anyone know what it is I don't want to ruin the surprise

03:13:16.280 --> 03:13:22.520
level 10 cooking we did it we did it are you squidding me right now

03:13:23.400 --> 03:13:30.760

03:13:47.640 --> 03:13:55.480
soon as I go get it I'm on level 11 it stops you cooking every every time it's selling oh I'm in

03:13:55.480 --> 03:14:03.160
the fire now I'm sacrificing myself for nothing interesting happens use it on the fire I think

03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:09.880
they mean the soup with the membership oh sorry sorry my bad apologies apologies me um no that's

03:14:09.880 --> 03:14:17.160

03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:31.880
okay who's making that noise

03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:37.880
sounds like someone's building something building something

03:14:40.520 --> 03:14:48.360
back to the fishing we're getting oh pardon me sorry maybe we should be doing the cows you know

03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:55.800
that so we can get um uh how to say it so we can get combat and maybe we can do a few more quests

03:14:55.800 --> 03:15:01.640
that require a tiny bit of combat before so we don't get too wrecked is there a timetable for

03:15:01.640 --> 03:15:08.280
super membership or is it still soon it's still soon um basically it's gonna pop up once it happens

03:15:08.280 --> 03:15:13.240
so we need to submit ourselves and youtube takes this sweet time to review that and all that and

03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:25.400
once it's accepted it's up to the girls whoop by the pope brian brian speak and on you didn't put

04:00:01.320 --> 04:00:06.840
place which is barbarian village I don't know if there's gonna be bot spam in there I could have

04:00:06.840 --> 04:00:13.080
sworn I came across a religion bot before that was spamming and it and I was like there is no way

04:00:13.080 --> 04:00:20.840
someone's paying for that it was the most bizarre thing this place has got to smell terrifying

04:00:20.840 --> 04:00:27.800
literally rotten fish on the floor everywhere burnt fish cooked fish like the whole of gellinore

04:00:27.800 --> 04:00:30.440
can smell our operation front over here

04:00:35.240 --> 04:00:37.160
wow hydration hydration hydration

04:00:44.680 --> 04:00:52.520
how is our fishing level so low what is that our fishing is 12 but our cooking is all the way up at 18

04:00:58.760 --> 04:01:00.040
oh

04:01:02.360 --> 04:01:05.640

oh my god we're getting flexed on someone's got a fishing rod

04:01:15.480 --> 04:01:21.000

04:01:27.880 --> 04:01:30.600
well it means gonna force chat to get her done

04:01:32.440 --> 04:01:38.680
there's only all I'm gonna say is there's only one way to finish that game there's only one real

04:01:38.680 --> 04:01:43.720
way to finish that game you should work in the seafood business

04:01:45.640 --> 04:01:49.880
imagine getting followed by Jehovah's Witnesses even in old-school runes game honestly

04:01:50.840 --> 04:01:57.080
there's boss like and it's like why you get more exp for cooking rather than yeah

04:01:58.120 --> 04:02:02.200
there's only one real ending to that game and I will accept no other

04:02:07.320 --> 04:02:13.400
any food by strongy seafood if I see it I eat it oh that's good I like that

04:02:13.400 --> 04:02:20.600
could I interest you in our lordency yeah have you heard of our lordency for Brian

04:02:21.560 --> 04:02:28.360
honestly I think I can't remember if I said this or not I thought they're just shouting out like

04:02:28.360 --> 04:02:33.400
randomly I would just shout like the most common like boy names and like a chance for someone to

04:02:33.400 --> 04:02:37.960
hear their name just like jack and then just freak you out and then we just go back to the

04:02:37.960 --> 04:02:43.480
gameplay and I played nothing happened what's another popular boy name I have no idea

04:02:43.480 --> 04:02:47.960

is west of the grand exchange um strongy has power to actually do eh crusted chef's hat weird flex

04:10:02.120 --> 04:10:08.920
that happened to me in final fantasy our marshmallow is anonymous yes um if you have firefox it

04:10:08.920 --> 04:10:14.200
might be able to translate the screen automatically sometimes a thousand why

04:10:15.640 --> 04:10:23.480
um I am going to make another cup of tea hop on stride is a yo

04:10:26.840 --> 04:10:32.040
um I'm gonna make another cup of tea because my voice is absolutely feeling it what do you

04:10:32.040 --> 04:10:38.440
mean doing multiple 12 or streams back to back is straining on the throat oh it says 10 is that

04:10:38.440 --> 04:10:45.160
like a runescape like congrats 10 balloon I saw that wait hold on let me make it look oh my god

04:10:45.160 --> 04:10:51.080
he's getting performance anxiety making that fire look it's a 10 he must have got it for 10 oh you

04:10:51.080 --> 04:10:59.000
don't look at your shirt what is it's like the logo let me zoom out a little bit it was the 10th

04:10:59.000 --> 04:11:10.840
anniversary how old is this game there's too many people well another cup of tea you mean a cup

04:11:11.640 --> 04:11:17.640
of tea for the non endurance stream right yeah surely as I say hold on the four hour mark and

04:11:17.640 --> 04:11:21.960
we're not even like level 20 and cooking yeah not an endurance stream at all

04:11:21.960 --> 04:11:29.640
oh google chrome apparently translates marshmallow as well but now if I send the marshmallow you'll

04:11:29.640 --> 04:11:37.000
know it's me no actually because I'm not opening them up right now and for some reason marshmallow

04:11:37.000 --> 04:11:42.840
puts like five questions from like loads of different times together at once it doesn't make

04:11:42.840 --> 04:11:52.280
any sense send the most horrendous cringe marshmallow and sign your name at the bottom

04:11:52.280 --> 04:11:58.760
like a gigatab I played when I was five on my older brother's account oh did he like force you

04:11:58.760 --> 04:12:10.600
to go questing that's funniest anything this isn't runescape huh it's old school runescape

04:12:11.560 --> 04:12:13.880
oh no we're getting corrections

04:12:15.880 --> 04:12:25.720
oh wow doing bot run on your brother's account for him oh I said Lamalle twice in the same

04:12:25.720 --> 04:12:33.720
sense oh my god cringe so cringe give it here you're in a level 14 fishing I mean we're getting

04:12:33.720 --> 04:12:41.160
somewhere oh no I think I might need pee pee bye bye time as well actually yeah a tea and a pee

04:12:41.160 --> 04:12:46.600
might but not a tea not the pee in the pee but I need a pee in the pee in general

04:12:51.880 --> 04:12:58.280
key quest is how often are these old school rooms I was gonna do a few endurance streams I have no

04:12:58.280 --> 04:13:04.840
idea how long cooking takes so I was gonna do a few endurance streams of it I was gonna try and

04:13:04.840 --> 04:13:11.720
finish it in one month but I don't know if that's just being like far too crazy cut off fish wrapper

04:13:11.720 --> 04:13:25.160
needs the tea and a pee on runescape with the refunds doing nothing hunting for shrimp I can't

04:13:25.240 --> 04:13:28.760
rhyme can't do it I don't know how people do it at the same time

04:13:30.760 --> 04:13:35.160
you can reasonably get night night cooking less than 30 hours okay I know currently we're not

04:13:35.160 --> 04:13:48.520
maxing but it'll do it'll do I'm gonna do that we did it 30 hours of one tick clicking

04:13:49.240 --> 04:13:56.360
level 20 cooking do we still burn shrimp on 20 with carab

04:13:57.240 --> 04:14:04.360
one this carab one's a real thing it might be in print oh I don't think you burn after level 20

04:14:07.320 --> 04:14:12.920
a reefling check for those of you who are on a fresh account what level are we looking at 20 as well

04:14:13.560 --> 04:14:21.320
you guys 20 carambuas or oh she sees okay you're done

04:14:24.520 --> 04:14:29.800
I've got 21 I've got 23 how are you all faster than me okay we'll go a little reefling

04:14:31.240 --> 04:14:39.720
okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a pee and a tea a classic um and we will be back

04:14:40.680 --> 04:14:45.880
hi how's runescaping we're doing good uh if you ever wanted to join in we're in world 3a

04:14:46.440 --> 04:14:51.640
top right there uh why is my latest tip we're not working it should be rotating right now

04:14:53.240 --> 04:15:02.200
sorry latest and uh and then we're gonna move to barbarian village next and we're gonna see what

04:15:02.200 --> 04:15:14.840
happens if there's oh wait no we can hmm the problem is I don't want to mute the in-game chat

04:15:14.840 --> 04:15:21.400
because of the bots I'm gonna go to bed have fun cooking oh well thank you for everything thank you

04:15:21.400 --> 04:15:31.240
for the extortionate prices for the shearers and all that um I just realized we would probably have

04:15:31.240 --> 04:15:39.320
to fat fly fish the fish ourselves unless we went to the grand exchange but only I have

04:15:39.320 --> 04:15:46.520
access to all the fish in my inventory so it's not like we can share it out equally hmm the

04:15:46.520 --> 04:15:53.640
bots on this world won't speak I mean I can't I just ignore them if we have to fly fish I think

04:15:53.640 --> 04:16:01.320
we need like level 20 fishing so we would be here for a bit longer hmm but rest well there's

04:16:01.320 --> 04:16:10.600
reeflings that do need to sleep yeah we would need 20 for the trout hmm oh sorry I just like we need

04:16:10.920 --> 04:16:19.000
fish and wine maybe we should pray but how can fish fly are you telling me this fish flies

04:16:25.560 --> 04:16:30.600
hmm I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm not sure you guys want to be held here for another

04:16:31.960 --> 04:16:35.160
what it were until we get like the actual level needed

04:16:35.640 --> 04:16:41.640
hmm I'm thinking but my brain isn't really coming up with any solutions it's either

04:16:43.720 --> 04:16:47.480
no there is no solution we have to keep being here until level 20 fishing

04:16:50.360 --> 04:16:55.480
and then we can move on it's gonna be a long road either well yeah literally if it takes 30 hours of

04:16:57.160 --> 04:17:01.880
like are you telling me a shrimp right this way are you telling me I've cuddled this fish

04:17:01.880 --> 04:17:07.400
yeah um if it's going to be a 30 hour stream anyway congrats on 20

04:17:08.680 --> 04:17:15.800
no questing for airy levels suck hmm yeah we're also pretty low on combat for fresh

04:17:15.800 --> 04:17:24.920
starts as well which is a bit hmm I don't know what we should do are you telling me I cuddled

04:17:25.640 --> 04:17:28.280
exactly you can do

04:17:30.600 --> 04:17:37.400
miss the mystery well here that quest is right here oh do we need okay how about that

04:17:37.400 --> 04:17:42.120
we go for a T and a P and we're gonna do some more questing just to break up the the fishing

04:17:42.120 --> 04:17:47.960
because that was quite a few levels we've got with fishing so we'll go do some questing and

04:17:49.560 --> 04:17:52.760
and then it can be broken up a little bit because I don't want to like hurt you too much

04:17:53.400 --> 04:17:58.440
just doing it over and over oh no you mean we have to stay here and keep chatting forever

04:17:58.440 --> 04:18:04.040
I would hate that oh wow oh that would suck yeah I'm glad I'm glad you enjoy my rambles

04:18:27.960 --> 04:18:34.360
bored out or not but we will start the cooking grind soon another German name for cuttlefish is

04:18:34.360 --> 04:18:44.840
Tintin fish a a Tintin fish a Tintin fish oh my gosh okay thank you for the tip iron report

04:18:45.720 --> 04:18:51.160

a Tintin fish a Tintin fish I can't do it I am a big Tintin fish then I mean

um level congratulations you reach a total level of 75 oh I'm flexing on other RuneScape players

04:19:14.200 --> 04:19:23.720
right now with that flexing Tintin fish equals an ink fish oh that's such a cool translation so Tintin

04:19:24.520 --> 04:19:34.760
Tint as in tint of a color and it's ink tint and so it means tinted fish the tint of the ink oh that's

04:19:34.760 --> 04:19:44.920
so cool wow why did I stop cooking I wish I was that high level sad face he says no one feel well

04:19:44.920 --> 04:19:55.000
he's probably like billions of levels higher than us tint and ink oh my god ich liebe ich liebe

04:19:55.000 --> 04:20:04.760
ich liebe Deutschland yeah okay I am going to go make a tea and pee whilst I fish

I will sing the actual this song

04:26:55.460 --> 04:26:59.500
this song can probably just leave the screen on

04:26:59.500 --> 04:27:04.060
okay

04:27:04.060 --> 04:27:08.920
I can give me the on when I sing

04:27:08.920 --> 04:27:10.980
pe-peeeeeeeeeeee

04:27:10.980 --> 04:27:12.340
wait

04:27:12.340 --> 04:27:13.380
why is he greeting

04:27:13.380 --> 04:27:18.340
Wait, what do you mean disconnected? I'm not disconnected! Wait, why are you

04:27:18.340 --> 04:27:24.260
greeting? What are you saying? She loves us. What? I never said that, didn't I?

04:27:24.260 --> 04:27:31.620
Because I went for a tinkle. You have 30 days. She's back quick, hide the memes.

04:27:31.620 --> 04:27:36.940
What were you doing while I was away? I've been away for a few minutes. How was the

04:27:36.940 --> 04:27:42.060
pee? It was not a lot of liquid again and I've literally finished up all the

04:27:42.060 --> 04:27:47.020
water. So, and I had a tea, and I finished a can of cola. I've got another bottle of

04:27:47.020 --> 04:27:51.620
water here. I don't know if you can hear my nails kind of against it. I'm gonna

04:27:51.620 --> 04:27:56.820
try and finish that and the tea. I'm not really sure what's going on.

04:27:56.820 --> 04:28:03.540
I'm being pranked. I've been pranked by my body. Wait, why does someone say she

04:28:03.540 --> 04:28:11.740
doesn't love us hard eyes? What? By the way, reeflings are the best. You say

04:28:11.740 --> 04:28:18.980
Coca-Cola. I hear burps. Cola burps. Cola burps. We did kiss the homies. Don't tell

04:28:18.980 --> 04:28:24.780
Amy that, she'll be jealous. I'm freaking, wait, I just caught an anchovy.

04:28:24.820 --> 04:28:33.940
What does it do? Oh wait, I'm now catching an anchovy because I'm a level? Oh, maybe

04:28:33.940 --> 04:28:40.420
that'll speed up the fishing level gain. Okay, I didn't know that. You put

04:28:40.420 --> 04:28:46.340
anchovies on a pizza. I don't think I've ever tasted that before. Burps. Oh, I was

04:28:46.340 --> 04:28:52.620
so proud when Shabee started burping in her streams. I was like, oh my god. My

04:28:52.660 --> 04:28:59.140
literal daughter. Oh my god. With all the tea she drinks, Johnny will be really

04:28:59.140 --> 04:29:13.740
sophisticated. That's not bad. The burps are hot. I don't understand the appeal of it,

04:29:13.740 --> 04:29:24.500
but then someone said, think of it about the aftermath. Give your run air back, I

04:29:24.500 --> 04:29:36.780
believe. We get to rate more mouth pranks. Why do you keep on firing? That's why

04:29:36.780 --> 04:29:42.180
there's a freaking fire. I'm getting pranked by the spine. Oh, I'm still burning

04:29:42.220 --> 04:29:49.780
stuff. I'm not level. I'm literally cooking level 22 and I'm still burning. That's pretty

04:29:49.780 --> 04:29:56.260
rough after this. This is taking us a hot second. Right, so what fishing level do we need?

04:29:56.260 --> 04:30:07.180
We need fishing level 20. Shabee made a burp speed. She's indeed cheaper. Exactly. That's what

04:30:07.180 --> 04:30:15.260
I thought. Tea bag in the fire. It's running, I kneel. I get so many things like, oh, I kneel

04:30:15.260 --> 04:30:20.500
for all the choices. The barbed village spot has a permanent fire to cook on. Oh, right,

04:30:20.500 --> 04:30:30.220
I'll put my tinderbox and axe away. And then we will buy fishing gear. We farm until 20

04:30:30.220 --> 04:30:34.300
fishing. I did know that. Yeah, we're going to do 20 fishing and then we're going to buy

04:30:34.620 --> 04:30:42.780
rods because some of us don't have that attachment. And then we get to go to Barbarian Village and we

04:30:42.780 --> 04:30:50.620
fish and we just keep doing that for a while. I think maybe we could get 40 doing that because

04:30:50.620 --> 04:30:55.740
salmon. However, the problem is the cost of feathers, but the problem's already been solved

04:30:55.740 --> 04:31:01.900
thanks to reeflings literally giving me an insane amount of in-game currency. Oh no,

04:31:01.900 --> 04:31:07.980
we're doing a quest. I completely forgot. I apologize. We are fishing level 20 fishing and

04:31:07.980 --> 04:31:11.900
then we're going to do a quest that's right here that begins with M. We're going to do maybe three

04:31:11.900 --> 04:31:19.020
quests just to break up the little fishing segment a little bit. It's called Mythilene Mystery.

04:31:19.020 --> 04:31:25.180
Mythilene Mystery. Burps are saying you ever like come through around someone. I am like, yeah.

04:31:26.700 --> 04:31:30.060
Some people like get taught it's really rude manners. Like obviously it's rude,

04:31:30.140 --> 04:31:36.380
like you wouldn't be in a job interview and burp in there. Actually speaking of burping in job

04:31:36.380 --> 04:31:41.340
interviews, I'm like 90% sure I accidentally burped when I was interviewing one of the girls

04:31:41.340 --> 04:31:47.580
revealer now that I think about it. Absolutely mortified. I think it might have been in me.

04:31:47.580 --> 04:31:52.380
You know that? No, it couldn't have been in me. I think it might have been Mercy. Someone

04:31:52.460 --> 04:31:54.620
had burped and I was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

04:32:00.300 --> 04:32:03.180
Did you hear about the Talon chef who died? He passed away.

04:32:06.940 --> 04:32:09.180
Oh, that didn't go, that didn't go down well.

04:32:11.580 --> 04:32:18.620
32, I think to stop burping, burning shrimp. Level 32, you stop burning shrimp. That's insane.

04:32:18.620 --> 04:32:24.700
Brian. Stronny, I hope you're proud. I was reading a comic earlier and all I heard was your

04:32:24.700 --> 04:32:31.740
voice. I'm so cooked. Oh, did that actually happen? Am I in your head? Thank you,

04:32:32.460 --> 04:32:36.860
Senpai. Am I in your head? Is my accent in your head?

04:32:49.260 --> 04:32:53.500
Okay, hopefully that hypno's off, that reverbs off on the mic because I actually

04:32:53.900 --> 04:32:56.060
I didn't say a thing that tells me if it's on or not.

04:33:00.140 --> 04:33:08.700
Always in your head. Soon, world domination. Soon, the first 99 cooking, okay. It's more

04:33:08.700 --> 04:33:19.980
attractive if someone doesn't care about it. Giving my wood the sort of group. What? Who is

04:33:19.980 --> 04:33:24.380
Riefling is this? Come get your Riefling. You've been in my head for a long time, Stronny.

04:33:26.700 --> 04:33:30.940
Cryo Freeze, Momento. See, Stronny, that's why I didn't want the undo button.

04:33:31.580 --> 04:33:37.180
Want an undo button. Right, I'm definitely cooking fish a heck of a lot faster now.

04:33:37.980 --> 04:33:39.980
Catching fish, my apologies, not cooking.

04:33:50.620 --> 04:33:59.420
We need to video game OST ranking. Okay, that slightly slows down progress now that we're

04:33:59.420 --> 04:34:05.260
also getting anchovies as well. I keep accidentally trying to use fish on people. I've literally

04:34:05.340 --> 04:34:11.500
slapped so many Rieflings with shrimp right now and feel really bad. Hopefully touching

04:34:11.500 --> 04:34:17.420
your legs with my shrimp. I'm like, please take my raw shrimp. At 21, I can finally turn cream.

04:34:18.780 --> 04:34:21.020
But we all turn cream together at the same time.

04:34:26.860 --> 04:34:33.340
If you look at it, it's kind of like a cute little fishing campsite. Riefling's on.

04:34:35.580 --> 04:34:45.180
There's a place to turn cream and lump. Wait, we can actually do it?

04:34:47.180 --> 04:34:51.500
Hey, I thought we had to wait for another time for doing that. Honestly, right by Farmer

04:34:51.980 --> 04:34:55.740
I didn't even know you can turn by. Take it, take my raw shrimp.

04:35:06.060 --> 04:35:10.860
I'm really happy that you said you love Germany. It's the first time we've worn something.

04:35:11.740 --> 04:35:19.180
Deutschland Uber alles! Deutschland Uber alles! There you go. That's like all the German I could

04:35:19.180 --> 04:35:23.580
come up with. Just Deutschland Uber alles. Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaver.

04:35:25.980 --> 04:35:31.980
Wait, I don't know why. Nope, that wasn't it. Don't do that again. Why?

04:35:36.060 --> 04:35:38.940
Hold on. I'm going to try, I don't know why it doesn't like that.

04:35:39.420 --> 04:35:42.220
I don't know why it's frozen.

04:35:46.940 --> 04:35:50.940
I'm so sorry, my little scroll and don't know things frozen. I'm gonna have to fix that next thing.

04:35:52.140 --> 04:35:55.740
Well, no way you can say that. Wait, what does Deutschland Uber alles means?

04:35:57.020 --> 04:36:00.540
Wait, if I just said something really bad, I thought it meant like Germany number one.

04:36:00.540 --> 04:36:05.420
Like China number one. What did I just say in German?

04:36:05.820 --> 04:36:08.780
Did I just say something really bad?

04:36:10.940 --> 04:36:16.140
I thought it meant China number one, but German number one. What did I just say?

04:36:23.180 --> 04:36:25.980
Did I just say something really bad? It sounds like...

04:36:26.300 --> 04:36:34.620
No, it's fine, but it can be associated with other stuff. I am so sorry,

04:36:36.620 --> 04:36:38.700
bitter. I am so sorry.

04:36:42.460 --> 04:36:50.540
I thought it meant China number one. Let's just forget about it. I am so sorry. I genuinely

04:36:50.540 --> 04:36:53.900
thought it meant China number one, but Germany number one.

04:36:56.940 --> 04:37:00.860
When you learned your German from Call of Duty, unironically, like...

04:37:01.740 --> 04:37:07.580
Oh my God, idiot, absolute idiot. I'm so sorry. I do apologize for that.

04:37:09.980 --> 04:37:14.860
It's the first line of a national anthem. Oh wait, it's the first line of the national...

04:37:14.860 --> 04:37:15.980
German national anthem?

04:37:19.420 --> 04:37:23.500
It's only problematic if you use in a specific contact. Oh, okay.

04:37:24.380 --> 04:37:30.300
Shawnee, tomorrow will start to pop out strange fan art of you in a strange and nostalgic outfit.

04:37:37.980 --> 04:37:42.380
Just remember, I don't own rights to previous things. That's what you're gonna...

04:37:42.940 --> 04:37:47.260
Like, I might not be able to interact with it if you're maybe getting a bit too cheeky.

04:37:48.140 --> 04:37:53.660
Yeah, their national anthem from 1930s. Wait, not... I'm sorry, I really didn't...

04:37:54.300 --> 04:37:57.500
Which Germany... Oh God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:37:59.980 --> 04:38:04.700
Oh, genuinely thought it meant China number one. Like, I don't know if you guys ever played

04:38:05.260 --> 04:38:13.180
pub G or something, pub Newgrounds or whatever. But everyone used to come in and go China number

04:38:13.180 --> 04:38:19.100
one. And that was it. That's basically what I thought I just said, but I did not say that at all.

04:38:22.060 --> 04:38:25.420
Don't worry, I'm new here. How do I find where you are on the map?

04:38:26.780 --> 04:38:31.580
So when you open up map, you will start here right outside of Lumberge.

04:38:32.860 --> 04:38:37.980
And you just take a... Or maybe you started at the quest guy. He's like literally right here.

04:38:37.980 --> 04:38:42.940
You want to go south. You can always use this cross here and click it and it will make everything

04:38:43.420 --> 04:38:49.180
like north point north. And then just come south through a graveyard and we are literally all here.

04:38:50.540 --> 04:38:53.740
So south through a graveyard and south again.

04:38:55.340 --> 04:38:55.820
Brian!

04:38:58.940 --> 04:39:03.500
I'm so sorry. I didn't... I genuinely didn't know what it meant. I do apologize.

04:39:04.700 --> 04:39:10.540
I thought like... I thought everyone was like yay because I said Germany number one.

04:39:10.620 --> 04:39:16.300
And there's a few German watchers and no, I'm just an idiot. So yep, there's that. Apologies.

04:39:17.180 --> 04:39:21.500
Sorry. Thank you for the tip. I do apologize.

04:39:23.900 --> 04:39:29.900
Ah, cringing at myself. I'm like, oh, maybe I should cut that segment out of the void honestly.

04:39:29.900 --> 04:39:34.620
I don't want anything happening. Like anything weird happening. Don't stress about it.

04:39:35.820 --> 04:39:37.020
Okay, I'll try to get there.

04:39:41.500 --> 04:39:45.820
I can't stop laughing. No, I don't laugh at me. I literally... Anyone got a fire?

04:39:47.820 --> 04:39:51.340
Yeah, probably take that out. I want to ask, how are you already so good at this?

04:39:51.340 --> 04:39:56.460
I watched someone else try and they only have two quests left in FTP but still need attack.

04:39:56.460 --> 04:40:01.580
Oh, I'm not good at the game. What? You were literally in it with us. I'm rubbish at the game.

04:40:02.620 --> 04:40:08.860
Well, actually we have one, two, three, four and five. We have five quests done.

04:40:08.860 --> 04:40:14.060
Oh wait, are you memeing? I watched someone try and they only have two quests left in FTP

04:40:14.060 --> 04:40:17.900
but still need a taxi to Viroc. Oh right, because I actually threw the game.

04:40:18.540 --> 04:40:24.060
What's the timestamp? Hold on. Four hours and like 38 minutes.

04:40:25.980 --> 04:40:32.060
Hold on, I need to make more of that. Four hours, 48 minutes.

04:40:39.100 --> 04:40:43.900
Oh, be on my... Right, there we go, wrote a note.

04:40:44.860 --> 04:40:46.620
Time to get this board chopped up.

04:40:48.460 --> 04:40:51.580
We have other... Another 90 levels of cooking in front of us.

04:40:51.580 --> 04:40:56.940
Don't let your... Your not... Sorry, the love heart's in the freaking way.

04:40:56.940 --> 04:40:59.740
In fact, it's in the way again. You're not Dutch knowledge, so...

04:41:00.620 --> 04:41:06.060
Hello, I am a Dutchman. I know how to speak Dutch.

04:41:06.060 --> 04:41:09.980
Yes, I know how to speak Dutch.

04:41:11.660 --> 04:41:17.500
Only 13 million XP to go. No, no, no cuttles, we're laughing with you. I was laughing at you.

04:41:17.500 --> 04:41:18.220
Okay, okay.

04:41:20.940 --> 04:41:24.700
Relaxing stream. Okay, I'm glad you find it chill like that.

04:41:25.020 --> 04:41:31.900
I'm sorry, I'm at the stage where I'm now cringing at myself thinking

04:41:32.860 --> 04:41:37.340
I thought that meant Germany number one in all the contexts that I'd ever seen that phrase.

04:41:41.820 --> 04:41:47.020
Anyway, I'm going to drink my tea and I'm probably going to cringe myself to sleep tonight.

04:41:49.740 --> 04:41:53.740
Have you declared... Have you declared war to something with that sentence or opened a bakery?

04:41:53.740 --> 04:41:55.900
Good people. Hopefully the bakery.

04:41:57.100 --> 04:42:02.700
You're fine. Oh no, is there fire maker going offline? I will make us a fire, don't you worry.

04:42:03.660 --> 04:42:08.140
Come, let me go get a tree. I think there's a tree in the swamp or something.

04:42:10.940 --> 04:42:14.060
Is there not a dead tree in here? Am I going crazy?

04:42:16.460 --> 04:42:20.220
I could have sworn there's like a dead tree in the swamp that you can... Oh, there is.

04:42:21.180 --> 04:42:26.060
I'm going to get jumped by a frog, but I'm going to be so quick with froggy and got time to attack me.

04:42:26.780 --> 04:42:33.740
Oh, I'm full. All right, drop, take the tree, and then run all the way back to the tree.

04:42:34.780 --> 04:42:41.100
Oh, you made fire. Sorry. Oh my god, my woodcutting is so bad. It's going to take forever to cut this tree.

04:42:41.980 --> 04:42:48.460
Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it. I have 50, not to brag or anything, but I've got 50 XP in woodcutting.

04:42:50.540 --> 04:42:56.940
Let's see. Okay, okay, we're back, we're back, we're back.

04:43:08.540 --> 04:43:15.820
Just so you know, Germany number one means Deutschland of dying irons. Maybe next time. Yeah.

04:43:16.300 --> 04:43:21.580
Deutschland, Deutschland of dying irons.

04:43:25.100 --> 04:43:31.420
We're learning who said streams and educate your man, huh? Get that on fire.

04:43:35.820 --> 04:43:40.380
A whole 50, literally, not to brag.

04:43:41.340 --> 04:43:46.700
What if you moved on to higher tier fish? So we're currently trying to get fishing level 20,

04:43:46.700 --> 04:43:49.740
and then we're going to do some questing just to get over all XP,

04:43:51.340 --> 04:43:56.620
and then we're going to move on to higher level fish, just to kind of break it up with a bit of fun

04:43:56.620 --> 04:44:04.940
questing in between. I hope I don't pass out too early to the confidence of this company and me so hard.

04:44:05.660 --> 04:44:17.500
Learning that a Scottish cut official of Germany, yes, this is educational content you've chosen one for.

04:44:27.500 --> 04:44:29.500
Are you squidding me right now?

04:44:30.460 --> 04:44:33.100
If it's for you, then we'll start the third world.

04:44:40.780 --> 04:44:50.860
Thank you for the tip, iron reefer, hardy har har. No, no, bad Brian. Don't read that out loud, Brian.

04:44:50.940 --> 04:45:00.060
That's naughty. There'll be no world wars. If anything, I'm actually a field medic,

04:45:01.500 --> 04:45:08.060
so I'm here to stitch you up and give you all negative blood when you're perishing from blood loss.

04:45:08.460 --> 04:45:16.620
I'm literally a bad boy, Brian, bad boy. Don't say that out loud. Oh my gosh.

04:45:20.380 --> 04:45:26.300
No AI, the AI uprising. What's going on here? Oh, I'm itching my little schnozer. I'm going to

04:45:26.300 --> 04:45:35.180
take a sip of my tea and see if it's, oh my god, it's the perfect sipping temperature,

04:45:35.180 --> 04:45:39.260
truly a British moment when you enjoy, when you appreciate the temperature of the tea.

04:45:42.940 --> 04:45:47.020
What are we on for fishing? Oh wait, I'm on 18 fishing. What are you guys on for fishing? We

04:45:47.020 --> 04:45:51.500
must be getting close. We can do the quest very shortly. I'm going to put all of this in my bank

04:45:51.500 --> 04:45:58.860
though. I am not questing with all of this money on me. Sorry, don't kill some of the money. I'm

04:45:58.860 --> 04:46:11.580
zero negative life. The perfect cup of the perfect time, perfect dunking. Oh, what are they called?

04:46:11.580 --> 04:46:16.460
Apparently custard cream's got named the best dunkable biscuit. Oh, you're like, how are you

04:46:16.460 --> 04:46:22.140
guys higher level than me, honestly? Yeah, are you cheesy, don't run.

04:46:28.380 --> 04:46:29.820
Did the Scott have a British moment?

04:46:32.300 --> 04:46:40.220
Unfortunately, I do seem to share some traits. Can I even light logs or is it going to take forever?

04:46:40.220 --> 04:46:47.420
Because I'm such a low level in fire like making three, four. Oh, it took me four times.

04:46:47.420 --> 04:46:52.540
Honestly, that wasn't that bad. 15, but I had to step away a few times. Ah.

04:46:54.700 --> 04:46:58.460
Oh, you had to step away because my, my soundboard jokes were just too good.

04:47:02.620 --> 04:47:06.220
Remember the one time when Facebook released an AI on the internet and learned from the

04:47:06.220 --> 04:47:09.180
community that turned into the biggest thing going wrong?

04:47:16.140 --> 04:47:19.420
Oh, it's four men in uniform to carry my little souls through home.

04:47:19.420 --> 04:47:28.060
What should he do? Should have been a musician, but he didn't have the money for a guitar.

04:47:29.100 --> 04:47:35.900
What should he do? Should have been a politician, but he didn't have a property. This is not the

04:47:35.900 --> 04:47:42.460
song that was. Did we do it? We're almost there. We flings. We're so close to 20.

04:47:43.900 --> 04:47:48.300
We're so close. By the way, do you have a plan for stages of cooking levels that would do it

04:47:48.300 --> 04:47:56.700
chilling spot until 99? I absolutely have no plan whatsoever. I've returned with logs for my fire duty.

04:47:58.540 --> 04:48:04.540
I honestly have no plan whatsoever. We're going to move on to Salmon and Trout at

04:48:04.540 --> 04:48:10.700
Barbarian Village after we do some questing. And then after that, I think it's just jugs of wine.

04:48:10.700 --> 04:48:14.620
And we're literally going to be hanging out like maybe at the Grand Exchange on like a very quiet

04:48:14.700 --> 04:48:24.220
server. Oh, level 19 fishing. There might be a quest we're going to do.

04:48:26.540 --> 04:48:32.540
Sorry for letting my inner German out, my guess. By the way, do you, oh no, the fact that she didn't

04:48:32.540 --> 04:48:36.140
correct the message does mean that she already chose to go straight to level 99.

04:48:36.860 --> 04:48:40.620
Yeah, that's the plan anyway. We're going to do some questing just to break it up.

04:48:40.700 --> 04:48:50.380
And then we are going to jump back into it. I want to see if maybe we could do level 40 today.

04:48:50.380 --> 04:48:54.940
I don't think I'm going to do a full endurance stream as much as I love to harass you guys

04:48:55.900 --> 04:49:01.020
and destroy your sleep pattern. I don't think we're going to do a full 12 hour stream today.

04:49:02.300 --> 04:49:08.780
Also, my freaking VOD broke. Apparently the VODs break on 11 hours and 55 minutes,

04:49:08.780 --> 04:49:14.780
not on the 12th hour. So the end of my VOD got chopped away and it just cuts off.

04:49:16.540 --> 04:49:26.780
15 trout, 20 is and 25 is salmon. Oh, we can make apple pies. Oh, I have a muffin.

04:49:28.380 --> 04:49:30.700
I have an apple muffin. I forgot to eat it yesterday.

04:49:31.180 --> 04:49:35.980
Yeah, something's like not really...

04:49:37.100 --> 04:49:39.740
YouTube VODs are almost especially the longer ones. Yeah.

04:49:41.340 --> 04:49:45.660
Oh, is it displaying again correctly? Maybe it changed. Yeah, they told us.

04:49:46.780 --> 04:49:49.820
That is a sad and frightening, so speaking super fast.

04:49:53.420 --> 04:49:56.860
M&M's got nothing on me when I'm saying bioreflums. Okay, I'm like,

04:50:01.660 --> 04:50:06.300
eh, that explains why all the other VJubers stopped 10 minutes before the 12 hour mark.

04:50:06.300 --> 04:50:12.620
Yeah, so unfortunately, we are having to bend the knee to the VOD overlords. I wonder,

04:50:12.620 --> 04:50:15.900
I suppose they had to give a number, like it doesn't matter.

04:50:18.540 --> 04:50:26.060
Circum... wait, I thought it said circumstance. Sure, you're not a mumble rat. Oh, I'm a mumble

04:50:26.060 --> 04:50:34.700
rat. I can assure you that much. I'm annunciating the words right now. I'm annunciating. Any annunciators?

04:50:40.540 --> 04:50:41.900
Oh, come on, catch that last one.

04:50:44.380 --> 04:50:53.260
Anything to do with this inventory full of shrimp? Drop them. If you go, you cook them on the fire

04:50:53.260 --> 04:50:58.780
and then you drop them once they're all cooked. It sounds like a decision made for some technical

04:50:58.780 --> 04:51:03.260
reason over at you. Yeah, like, I assumed they had to put like a number on it, but they couldn't

04:51:03.260 --> 04:51:10.220
just infinitely do it. Although there's those accounts that used to infinitely stream music,

04:51:10.220 --> 04:51:15.740
was it lo-fi girl or something like that? They just like constantly like keep going.

04:51:16.300 --> 04:51:23.660
I'll chug them all. If you go into sentence, you can hit, I think it's like controls or something,

04:51:23.660 --> 04:51:27.820
and it's like use shift to drop, and then if you hold shift, you can drop your full inventory stack

04:51:27.820 --> 04:51:42.700
really quickly. Okay, level 25 cooking. I'll take it, like we're getting there. It's if I could stop

04:51:42.700 --> 04:51:47.580
burning this stuff, if we stop burning, we'd be like literally flying through the levels.

04:51:48.140 --> 04:51:56.780
Right, 20 is maybe one more deck officially. Lo-fi girl never saved vods and didn't let you

04:51:56.780 --> 04:52:04.540
rewind, so that could be why. We are learning. Okay, more of my tea. I keep forgetting.

04:52:08.700 --> 04:52:10.460
And these fishes are hiding from me.

04:52:13.580 --> 04:52:20.140
So I assume it costs money to get some of these hysterics costumes, because

04:52:20.940 --> 04:52:26.940
these are like total costumes. I have to go in 10 minutes. I can't stay on Firejoy forever.

04:52:26.940 --> 04:52:31.180
Yes, that's okay. Don't worry, we can take over. We're probably doing by Quest next.

04:52:32.220 --> 04:52:39.820
But thank you for your service. Wait, hold on, 07. Thank you for your service on Firejoy. 07,

04:52:39.820 --> 04:52:47.980
we salute. Yeah, Wi-Fi, low-fi girl is more like a follower radio channel.

04:52:47.980 --> 04:52:54.300
Yeah. The only MTX in old-school RuneScape is Bond.

04:53:00.060 --> 04:53:05.020
You can stream non-stop, but when you end the VOD, it will only save the foot 11.55.

04:53:05.100 --> 04:53:14.060
Hmm. Well, I'll need to know that for the Donathons, because Azuras is first.

04:53:16.380 --> 04:53:20.860
20! I'm finally fishing level 20. That took so long.

04:53:24.620 --> 04:53:31.980
I can drop them. Okay, we're level 20. We're gonna do questing once I finish this batch that I've got.

04:53:32.940 --> 04:53:37.180
And then we'll go to the bank and drop off all our items and see what this Quest

04:53:37.180 --> 04:53:40.460
mini thing is all about. I don't know if I need any items for it, is it this?

04:53:41.820 --> 04:53:44.460
It began with an M, so let's scroll down to M.

04:53:48.060 --> 04:53:49.420
Let's scroll up to M.

04:53:53.740 --> 04:54:00.460
Mystery, what do we need for that? We need, oh, we get a reward. What do we need for it?

04:54:00.460 --> 04:54:08.620
Recommended items, none. Enemies to defeat, none. Okay, right. We'll definitely do this.

04:54:09.260 --> 04:54:14.700
Nicely. Oh, she is right there. Okay, that makes perfect sense by that reefling. Suggested that

04:54:15.820 --> 04:54:22.540
silly of me. If we're going to do some quests, we're going to the city, then we're going to the

04:54:22.540 --> 04:54:28.540
city, then the door closes, won't close back. We're gonna put our items away first before we

04:54:28.540 --> 04:54:32.140
continue with the questing. I actually have to go to, don't worry if you have to go,

04:54:32.140 --> 04:54:37.260
thank you so much reeflings for hanging, I appreciate it. I am going to try and get level

04:54:37.260 --> 04:54:43.500
99 in one month for cooking, so there will be plentiful opportunities to come hang.

04:54:44.380 --> 04:54:49.020
I'm also going to do it during the week instead of on the weekend as well to give

04:54:50.460 --> 04:54:56.380
the people who work on the weekends a chance as well to come in and join in the fun.

04:54:58.540 --> 04:55:04.700
Okay, everyone who is fishing, if you want to cook the fish, we're going to take it to the bank,

04:55:04.700 --> 04:55:09.020
if you want to cook it the new, and then we're going to make our way to the castle,

04:55:09.020 --> 04:55:15.500
and then we're going to come back and, oh, my fire, my fire perished.

04:55:17.180 --> 04:55:24.300
So get cooking, good looking. Oh wait, that's the song, hey, good looking. What you got cooking?

04:55:25.100 --> 04:55:30.140
It's shrimp on a fire, shrimp on the barbie. Oh, we're so Aussie out here.

04:55:31.260 --> 04:55:40.540
Can you go back to the mystery area after you finish? Oh wait, should we just do the quest?

04:55:43.180 --> 04:55:46.940
Reeflings have done the quest, should we just do the quest now instead of going all the way back

04:55:46.940 --> 04:55:57.740
and like here again? I finished my tea, yeah, you can't. Do they actually eat a lot of shrimp

04:55:57.740 --> 04:56:02.380
in Aussie land? I don't know, just do the quest, okay, we'll do the quest.

04:56:06.380 --> 04:56:09.900
I'll wait for everyone to finish up and do their thing, and then we'll start.

04:56:10.860 --> 04:56:16.860
So let you guys cook, those who are fishing, you can un-fish and cook, and then we'll start

04:56:16.860 --> 04:56:23.420
with this quest, and we'll pick another one. We'll do three quests I think, and I either need to do

04:56:23.420 --> 04:56:31.740
stream split recording, yeah, for the donathons, I know you need to do back to back, so I'm actually

04:56:31.740 --> 04:56:35.980
gonna have to get like a video put together for Azura to play when she goes to sleep.

04:56:35.980 --> 04:56:41.420
Hopefully her PC doesn't explode midstream. Should be a way to sleep in the thing just

04:56:42.540 --> 04:56:45.100
catch some fire in the corner of the room and she's like, okay.

04:56:50.780 --> 04:56:57.340
We eat prawns. Are you squidding me right now? Who goes there Brian? Do you read Patreon messages?

04:56:58.060 --> 04:57:02.380
No, so none of the talents have access to Patreon messages because it's like direct

04:57:02.460 --> 04:57:08.860
messages, so they don't have access to that stuff? No. So no, I read Marshmallows though,

04:57:08.860 --> 04:57:17.980
your mother won't come to send a moishie. I'm drinking water now after finishing my tea.

04:57:23.180 --> 04:57:29.100
Okay, is everyone almost ready? I'm gonna drop three inventory space, I'll just drop

04:57:29.100 --> 04:57:35.900
three anchovies, why not? Right, we will talk to this lady, I'll put walking on.

04:57:36.540 --> 04:57:45.580
Let's see what happens. Help, help! Start the quest. Sure, are you guys ready to come over?

04:57:47.340 --> 04:57:50.940
I'll get to 20 later. Yeah, we can always come back and do our thing.

04:57:53.260 --> 04:57:58.140
Thank you for the tip though Anonymous. You really are shy, you could ask that for free,

04:57:58.140 --> 04:58:02.380
you didn't have to give me money to ask that question. You guys are always welcome to ask and

04:58:02.380 --> 04:58:06.140
chat, I know it can be never again, or you can ask in Marshmallow but I might be sold to respond

04:58:06.140 --> 04:58:12.300
because I'm not reading Marshmallows right now. Thank you for the tip but save your money at the

04:58:12.300 --> 04:58:20.060
same time, seriously. Ray, are we ready? Are you my refillings? You are. You're not quite ready,

04:58:20.060 --> 04:58:26.700
hold on. Oh, sorry, right, I'm accepting the quest. What has happened here? We were invited to

04:58:26.700 --> 04:58:30.140
house party on the island, not far from here, something felt wrong about the whole thing but

04:58:30.140 --> 04:58:33.900
we went away. The house seemed pretty creepy but everything was going fine, we were having a good

04:58:33.900 --> 04:58:40.700
time and that's when we got attacked and I tried to save her. Huey brought me enough time to find

04:58:40.700 --> 04:58:46.140
an old boat, I went back to get him but it was too late, I'm scared he won't make it. You have to do

04:58:46.140 --> 04:58:52.700
something, they can't get away with this. What do you want me to do? That cycle is still out there,

04:58:52.700 --> 04:58:57.900
you have to bring them to justice. The boat we escaped on is just over there and you can use

04:58:57.900 --> 04:59:04.220
it to get to the island. Okay, I'll see what I can do. I need to fight, I hope not. Can reflings see

04:59:04.220 --> 04:59:16.060
this boat over here? Are you pointing the way? Let's check that you're all here. Who's got a

04:59:16.060 --> 04:59:24.860
refling? Got a few. Okay, end of the boat, end of the boat. Benjens, how bold of you considering

04:59:24.860 --> 04:59:29.980
she has a plan? Strania, I was wondering if you were following some kind of gay deciding to do,

04:59:29.980 --> 04:59:34.300
nah I'm just going for it. We're literally doing quest and right now like I'm already getting distracted

04:59:35.500 --> 04:59:42.940
from the 99 grind. Okay, I think that's all my reflings, these are

04:59:43.820 --> 04:59:50.540
actual plots. Okay, into the boat we go, yippee! There's a chance you ask the question and

04:59:50.540 --> 04:59:55.740
check, typically better chance, I don't know. I know but you can still do it for free, just

04:59:55.740 --> 05:00:02.540
like keep, like if I miss it then ask it again in like a couple of minutes. Oh my god, there's so

05:00:02.540 --> 05:00:07.740
many of us doing this quest right now, we're gonna overload this. It looks kind of familiar.

05:00:07.980 --> 05:00:15.980
Oh, okay, we need to take a left refling, for those of you who don't have the plugin,

05:00:16.860 --> 05:00:21.740
we're gonna pick up this bucket right here on the left. Oh no, is it instance bucket? Why are

05:00:21.740 --> 05:00:29.100
we taking the bucket? Pick up from the bucket, is it an instance bucket? Oh no, we can all take it,

05:00:29.100 --> 05:00:38.700
okay, that's good. Okay, drop. Okay, everyone get a bucket, pick up your bucket, subscribe by the

05:00:38.700 --> 05:00:49.260
fountain. Oh my god, the beacons are lit, Gondor calls trade. Okay, and then we have the barrel

05:00:50.140 --> 05:00:57.100
of rainwater, interact with it, we need to search it. Okay, there's like lots of noises going on.

05:00:59.740 --> 05:01:09.420
Whoa, party on, bro. Oh, it's like that movie that I've not seen. Whoa, the wind totally just felt

05:01:09.420 --> 05:01:23.900
like sun breathing on my neck. Oh, not cool, bro. I feel woozy, gurg, I see the light. It's not my

05:01:23.900 --> 05:01:29.820
time, glurg, glurgle, gargle. Oh, that's a bit. I don't know what movie he's from, I've not seen it,

05:01:30.620 --> 05:01:36.460
but I've seen it, you know what I mean? I've not seen the movie. Help me.

05:01:39.740 --> 05:01:44.540
Man, you're taking a while to perish. Sid claps is on the ground in a crumpled mess,

05:01:44.540 --> 05:01:49.900
as he falls down, you spot something shiny fall out of his shirt pocket and into the barrel of water.

05:01:50.860 --> 05:01:57.820
Gosh, that was horrible and so drawn out. Oh, wow, he's still going.

05:02:01.340 --> 05:02:05.500
I think he's actually gone this time. Who are you? Why are you doing this?

05:02:07.340 --> 05:02:14.300
He didn't say anything. Scary movie. Oh, it's scream. I've got to find a way into that house and stop

05:02:14.460 --> 05:02:21.660
this maniac. I wonder what it is that I saw fall into that barrel. Search the barrel,

05:02:21.660 --> 05:02:27.340
reflings. The barrel's full of rainwater. I can't see what's in there. Oh, right, click on the barrel

05:02:27.340 --> 05:02:32.060
in your inventory and use it on the barrel of rainwater. You fill the bucket from the barrel.

05:02:32.060 --> 05:02:37.260
Okay, now what? Now we search the barrel. You find a key at the bottom of the barrel.

05:02:38.060 --> 05:02:46.060
Are you saying strongly? Okay, now we go to the front of the house.

05:02:50.380 --> 05:02:55.660
It's so scary. Oh, it's making a good noise.

05:02:59.180 --> 05:03:04.460
Chop down. No, open large door. Okay, here we go. The bunny went ahead. I saw that bunny.

05:03:04.460 --> 05:03:11.020
He closed the door behind you. Let us in the house. Right, there we go. Oh, the door all

05:03:11.020 --> 05:03:17.100
closes. Hold on. I think the door all closed. Oh, does it all close? Wait, I can't even get in.

05:03:17.100 --> 05:03:23.660
Is this open large door? No. I think we're all trying to get in at once, right? I'm not clicking

05:03:23.660 --> 05:03:32.780
it. I'm just, okay, Danny. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, all right, I'm getting there. We're getting

05:03:33.420 --> 05:03:38.940
there. We're getting there. Hold on. Hold on. Why am I not going inside? It's not because someone's

05:03:38.940 --> 05:03:47.420
doing the door thing. It's one at a time. Right, okay, that's fine. Okay, okay, I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

05:03:47.420 --> 05:03:52.860
Okay. Oh, that took the hot thing there. Right, let's get the other reflins in. Everyone in, everyone

05:03:52.860 --> 05:03:58.540
in. Okay, a few more. A few more reflins, fewer stragglers. Can you come? Can you come?

05:03:59.260 --> 05:04:07.660
One more, one more, and you come, and you come. Click that door. Right, we're in, we're in.

05:04:07.660 --> 05:04:14.300
Everyone touch the table in the entrance way. Oh my goodness. There's a knife on the table.

05:04:14.300 --> 05:04:20.940
Touch that table. Ooh, we're touching the table. Okay, once you've touched the table,

05:04:20.940 --> 05:04:32.460
touch this door. Ooh, the door, the door. Oh, cut scene. Knock, knock. Who's there? Oh, no.

05:04:34.780 --> 05:04:42.620
Gurgle. Oh, he said you're next to me.

05:04:42.780 --> 05:04:51.100
Oh, he's using cheat see doodles. What's this? A note? I guess I should read it.

05:04:51.100 --> 05:04:56.380
Ooh, let's go get the note. Oh, you left the note, okay. It should be a note to your left.

05:04:56.380 --> 05:05:02.220
You take a copy of the note. Ooh, let's read it. Isn't murder just the work of art,

05:05:02.220 --> 05:05:07.020
beautiful yet haunting like the blade of a knife as we wander through the valley of death?

05:05:07.020 --> 05:05:19.340
Ooh, spooky. Oh, okay. Is this on the other side? Oh, okay. Everyone enter this room.

05:05:19.340 --> 05:05:24.620
It doesn't really, really much of a room. Oh, it's a some room anyway. Oh, look at this painting.

05:05:24.620 --> 05:05:32.620
Wait, why am I getting turned this way for the painting? Hello? Hello? Okay, examine painting.

05:05:33.420 --> 05:05:40.060
Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh, use the knife on the painting. I didn't

05:05:40.060 --> 05:05:43.180
even know I had a knife on me. Use the knife in your inventory on the painting.

05:05:44.220 --> 05:05:48.700
Beat that painting up. Show it to your mean boss. You slash open the painting revealing

05:05:48.700 --> 05:05:57.660
a hidden storage compartment. Search painting. You find a key hidden inside the slash painting.

05:05:57.660 --> 05:06:03.500
Oh, okay. If you found your key, come back out into the entrance way. If you've got the key

05:06:03.500 --> 05:06:09.500
from the painting by cutting it up into the entrance way. Okay, just a few more.

05:06:10.860 --> 05:06:16.300
Use the knife in your inventory on the painting in that room. And then once you've got the key,

05:06:16.300 --> 05:06:23.340
come back into the hallway. We're doing it. We're questing. They have a higher pit than you.

05:06:24.300 --> 05:06:26.700
Man, what's a pit?

05:06:30.860 --> 05:06:31.420
Are we good?

05:06:34.300 --> 05:06:41.660
There should be a knife in your inventory. And then you can highlight it by using right click

05:06:41.660 --> 05:06:50.860
and then slash the shizzle of it. There you go, you key. Alrighty. And then we go through this door

05:06:50.860 --> 05:07:01.660
right here. Oh, there's a reefing party in here, clearly. Oh, so it's spooking us behind the door.

05:07:03.500 --> 05:07:07.820
Okay, once you enter this new room, there's a little orby thing to the left. I don't know

05:07:07.820 --> 05:07:14.460
what it does, but it's highlighted. Examine the unlit candle on the wall. Oh, we're to tinder box

05:07:15.420 --> 05:07:22.060
or to tinder box, the thing on the wall. Tinder box, the unlit candle.

05:07:24.380 --> 05:07:27.500
Oh, wait, do you guys need a knife or a tinder box or is it like in this room?

05:07:32.860 --> 05:07:36.620
Do you guys need me to trade this? There's a bunch in here. Okay, okay, that's good.

05:07:37.180 --> 05:07:40.860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, literally all in the shelf. There's a tinder box on the shelf if you need help.

05:07:41.660 --> 05:07:46.140
You light the candle. So light the two unlit candles. Oh, there's a third one as well.

05:07:46.140 --> 05:07:51.660
Oh, excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Video Game. Oh, I just touched my fish. Hold on, wait.

05:07:56.220 --> 05:07:59.980
I think she's more happy of the fact that there's only 20 people doing the same.

05:08:01.180 --> 05:08:07.660
Literally, Jagex is like, what on earth? I'm sure they've had it before where people go

05:08:07.660 --> 05:08:12.620
questing together. You light the candle. The room is sufficiently warm. The fuse

05:08:12.620 --> 05:08:21.900
should now have dried out. Oh, once you tinder box all the things, do the barrel?

05:08:24.620 --> 05:08:29.420
I don't know. And get the heck out of the room. Get out of the room as soon as you light that thing.

05:08:29.420 --> 05:08:34.220
Hold on, let me run. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room.

05:08:34.300 --> 05:08:41.420
Oh, the thing about to blow. Oh, okay, okay, okay.

05:08:44.460 --> 05:08:49.900
All right. Hey, it's the shadow one that kept closing the doors on me.

05:08:51.900 --> 05:08:56.700
That's not a knife. This is a knife. Why are you so excited if I touch the doors and noodles?

05:08:56.700 --> 05:09:00.700
I'm just like, it's so fun being like, oh my God, request them together. And for those

05:09:00.700 --> 05:09:06.220
who don't have room light, I'm like, I'm the quest teller, you know? So once you've let everything

05:09:06.220 --> 05:09:10.860
and blew it up, we can all go outside in this section. So I'll wait for the reeflings to come

05:09:10.860 --> 05:09:13.820
over. Yeah, they're like having to get out the room because it's blowing up.

05:09:15.900 --> 05:09:22.540
I just find it really fun getting to play games together. Momelo. So we're getting

05:09:23.260 --> 05:09:26.460
the God Sword, right? I don't know what the God Sword is.

05:09:27.340 --> 05:09:33.500
We are all here merely by coincidence. There's absolutely nothing in common that we all have.

05:09:38.620 --> 05:09:42.380
Is there anyone else in sake? Are you kidding me right now?

05:09:42.940 --> 05:09:49.340
Brian. It's 1am. I have to tap out. Sleep well. Enjoy the rest of your stream with the reeflings.

05:09:49.340 --> 05:09:53.980
Thank you so much, Pajango. Please rest well. Maybe see you in the morning. I don't know if

05:09:53.980 --> 05:09:59.900
this is endurance yet. Yes, there's four candles in that room to light on the walls. You take a

05:09:59.900 --> 05:10:05.660
tinder box from the shelf, little tinder box on the shelf, and then you light all four candles in

05:10:05.660 --> 05:10:11.260
the room. And then there'll be a powder keg that you can light here just on the outskirts of that room.

05:10:11.900 --> 05:10:17.740
It will blow a hole in the wall, but you need to light it and then leave the room. So it blows up.

05:10:18.700 --> 05:10:21.100
And then that's you.

05:10:23.580 --> 05:10:29.020
Or that door. I mean, you're not wrong. I don't know if it blows up if you go out on that door,

05:10:29.020 --> 05:10:35.660
but the other door. Or did it blow up? Boom. Okay, there you go. I blew up. I think that's

05:10:35.660 --> 05:10:42.140
all the reeflings. I don't see anyone else hiding in that room. Can you come over? Yeah! Okay,

05:10:42.220 --> 05:10:49.260
reeflings. Let's go next. Let's go next. We're doing it. Oh, if you click here on the foot,

05:10:50.780 --> 05:10:56.060
on the mini map up here, it'll put running on. So if it's brown, it means you're walking. If it's

05:10:56.060 --> 05:11:02.620
golden, it means you're running. Your stamina will regain eventually. So don't worry. Oh,

05:11:02.620 --> 05:11:07.100
suspiciously. Let's observe this suspicious tree over here.

05:11:07.100 --> 05:11:14.220
Please stop this. Just let me go. Oh, it's kind of messed up. We're going to play a game. Do you

05:11:14.220 --> 05:11:21.500
like to play games? Yeah, no. Yes, whatever you say, just then it hurt me. Whether you get hurt

05:11:21.500 --> 05:11:26.140
or not is entirely up to you. Your fate is in your own hands. What? What do you mean?

05:11:27.260 --> 05:11:34.060
Leave her alone, you monster. Ah, Scottlefish. How kind of you to join us. Now, if you say another

05:11:34.060 --> 05:11:40.620
word, I will end her right now. Sorry, where were we? Ah yes, of course, the game. Do you like

05:11:40.620 --> 05:11:52.060
quests, Lissy? Uh, sure, I like quests. Do you like scary quests? Uh-huh. What's your favorite

05:11:52.060 --> 05:12:01.020
scary quest? I don't know. You have to have a favorite. Uh, the one with a vampire in it who

05:12:01.020 --> 05:12:07.820
lives in the big house. Good, good. And now for that game I spoke about. I am going to ask you

05:12:07.820 --> 05:12:13.580
one question. Get it wrong and you die, but get it right and you live. How is that fair? Oh,

05:12:13.580 --> 05:12:19.740
gothicks. Please, gothicks? Isn't that a type of armor? Oh, gothicks, please, no, please,

05:12:19.740 --> 05:12:25.740
don't. I don't want to die. Then think hard about your answer. You like vampires, so this should

05:12:25.740 --> 05:12:35.340
be easy for you. The question is, who is the vampire that resides in South Mish? I would be

05:12:35.340 --> 05:12:43.900
perishing. Um, I'm to say nothing. I'm not, I'm not to say anything. He said he's gonna slash her

05:12:43.900 --> 05:12:50.940
if I say anything. Oh yes, yes, I know it. Count Draenor. Ha, in your face, you masked freak.

05:12:51.660 --> 05:12:58.380
Oh, Lacy, Lacy, Lacy, I did tell you to think hard about your answer. Count Draenor is in fact a

05:12:58.380 --> 05:13:09.340
vampire and he does reside in his manor in Mithilith, but that manor is in West Mithilith. I was

05:13:09.340 --> 05:13:16.220
talking about Count Chek. Thanks for playing. No, no, you tricked me. This isn't fair. Ask me another.

05:13:16.220 --> 05:13:29.020
Gargle, gargle, gargle, gargle. The writing in this game is, I think it's because I have,

05:13:29.020 --> 05:13:36.540
oh, he's leaving his notes? Okay, I'll take the note. Do you like jazz? Take the note, please.

05:13:37.260 --> 05:13:41.740
That monster, oh, I can't do that because I actually only clicked on the note. Oopsies, take note.

05:13:42.700 --> 05:13:49.980
You take the note, what does it say? It's like music to my ears, the glory sounds spelling out your

05:13:49.980 --> 05:13:58.460
fate. Oh, okay, get into the, once you pick up the note, there's a piano. Where to do something with

05:13:58.460 --> 05:14:07.500
it? Someone is throwing Easter eggs everywhere. Play piano. Okay, once you're on the piano,

05:14:08.060 --> 05:14:23.100
delta, echo, alpha, delta. Did we do it right? Oh, there's a compartment. Can I play for real?

05:14:25.260 --> 05:14:27.260
Oh, you can't. You can't play this one.

05:14:27.260 --> 05:14:37.660
You can't play this one. You can't play this one. Oh, I think my inventory is full, hold on.

05:14:37.660 --> 05:14:39.420
I think there's something I'm supposed to grab.

05:14:42.140 --> 05:14:50.300
Play piano, search piano, search piano. Oh, once you play that, delta is just, I don't see a delta

05:14:50.380 --> 05:14:56.940
button. Oh, very funny, very funny. Oh, it spells out dead. Do you like metal? Does baby metal

05:14:56.940 --> 05:15:10.060
count as metal? I like OST from Doom. Doom? Yeah, Doom 2007, BFG is probably my favorite,

05:15:10.060 --> 05:15:15.180
if that counts as metal song. Has everyone got the key? If you got the key, come up the hallway a

05:15:15.180 --> 05:15:19.580
little bit. Oh wait, we're, oh no, we're supposed to go back. Okay, if you've got the key, come out

05:15:19.580 --> 05:15:27.580
of the room. Let's see if there's any, who's not got the key? Got the key, got the key.

05:15:30.620 --> 05:15:34.140
Someone's, I don't know if someone's in that cutscene with the guy.

05:15:36.300 --> 05:15:44.460
Spelled dead on the piano from the left side. Is that Hatsune Miku? It's Hatsune Miku. Hello guys,

05:15:45.020 --> 05:15:52.380
my name is Hatsune Miku. I'm thinking Miku, Miku. There's a refling here, but I don't know if

05:15:52.380 --> 05:16:04.700
they're in a cutscene or not, I'm not sure. I don't know what's happening with this refling,

05:16:04.700 --> 05:16:12.940
I think they might be AFK, but everyone, oh, I don't know. Miku, you're, Miku, you're mine.

05:16:15.660 --> 05:16:22.220
I think so. Okay, I think so, you're hanging out with us. I don't know, oh, oh, did you get the key?

05:16:24.300 --> 05:16:29.500
Do you need to do the piano bit? I don't know. Oh right, spell dead on the piano and then search

05:16:29.500 --> 05:16:32.940
the piano. And left side spell dead, if that makes sense.

05:16:36.300 --> 05:16:41.980
Damn, there's no cheer remote. There is in game. Wait, where is it? Cheer, cheer. Okay,

05:16:41.980 --> 05:16:48.300
that's the best I got. Sorry, I was AFK, I'll catch up. Yeah, just spell, yeah, yeah, there you go,

05:16:48.300 --> 05:16:55.500
you got it, you got the key. If you touch the piano and then on left spell side and then you

05:16:55.500 --> 05:17:02.540
should get key. I think everyone's got the key. Yippee, everyone's got the key, right, let's go.

05:17:02.540 --> 05:17:05.980
Come back inside the house from the side, we blew it up on the powder keg.

05:17:07.100 --> 05:17:10.780
Oh, it's a room full of reflings. Oh no, just me in a room full of reflings.

05:17:13.340 --> 05:17:17.020
Okay, come back into the entrance hallway. Oh, we're getting stuck on the door.

05:17:17.900 --> 05:17:26.220
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, right, hold on. You again! It's him, it's him that's doing it.

05:17:27.260 --> 05:17:31.500
It's him that's doing it, I'm getting freaking stuck. Wait, how'd that come around?

05:17:32.620 --> 05:17:39.980
I literally can't progress. Stop it, I can't even get through. Or is it one by one? Oh,

05:17:39.980 --> 05:17:43.980
maybe a one by one, hold on. I might be accusing someone of closing the door and I think it's one

05:17:43.980 --> 05:17:49.900
by one. Oh, right, oh, sorry, sorry, I just, I'm sorry, refling. Miss input, miss input!

05:17:51.500 --> 05:17:58.780
Oh, it's a miss input, okay. Shawnee letting her imagination run wild. Honestly, honestly?

05:18:00.140 --> 05:18:03.340
Okay, so one by one door, take your time, take your time, it's one by one door.

05:18:04.300 --> 05:18:07.820
Right, here we come. Stop, refling! Let us come in.

05:18:13.260 --> 05:18:17.260
Everyone's got a better ping than me! Okay, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

05:18:20.540 --> 05:18:27.020
Okay, then through the other one by one door. Oh, it's a cutscene. Accusing her own

05:18:27.580 --> 05:18:32.220
beloved loyal refling. Why am I the only one always left cleaning up after everyone?

05:18:33.100 --> 05:18:41.900
Shuffle? Hello, anyone there? Russell? Hello, Lacey said. Scratch.

05:18:43.580 --> 05:18:51.260
Hmm, well I guess I should go check it out. No point saying in this nice locked room when I could

05:18:51.260 --> 05:18:57.580
go outside into the creepy darkness. Seriously? The walls and doors seem too thick for Mandy to

05:18:57.580 --> 05:19:03.340
be able to hear you. Oh, and I don't think there is any need to take this big shiny

05:19:03.340 --> 05:19:09.020
weapon with me in order to defend myself. Nothing bad ever happens when people go check out noises

05:19:09.020 --> 05:19:16.300
in the dark outside the house. You have gotta be kidding. Okay, well here I go.

05:19:16.700 --> 05:19:23.820
Bando Scotsword. Hello, anyone out here?

05:19:26.780 --> 05:19:30.940
See, I knew nothing would happen. Must have just been a squirrel or something running about.

05:19:36.220 --> 05:19:39.660
Oh well, back to the dishes. Phew, that was lucky.

05:19:40.540 --> 05:19:44.060
Oh, he's behind you!

05:19:47.180 --> 05:19:53.420
No, why me? That psycho. He was just toying with her.

05:19:55.340 --> 05:20:00.620
Oh, we're getting left another note, I think. Is this talk to killer? Just look at what we can.

05:20:00.620 --> 05:20:06.780
We're in a cutscene. And he's hiding away again. Another note, this guy really likes playing games,

05:20:06.780 --> 05:20:13.500
but this is going to be the game he won't win. Okay, there should be a note on the ground for us

05:20:13.500 --> 05:20:22.700
to read now. Here, at first, these words. Each murder you witness helplessly from start to end

05:20:22.700 --> 05:20:28.860
as you fail to solve the final letters of this quiz. Razor sharp like a gemstone is the blade of my

05:20:28.860 --> 05:20:36.620
knife. The last sound you hear will be your screams echo. Hita, I will have the final word

05:20:36.700 --> 05:20:48.780
in this thriller. Okay, we need to go back into the hallway on the one-by-one door, so we need to be patient.

05:20:48.780 --> 05:21:04.140
I'm standing and lying. I was looking in soft lock by a door. Okay, there we go, I made it through.

05:21:06.060 --> 05:21:13.900
Wait, what was that? Oh, that makes sense. Is there a refland just out there chilling?

05:21:13.900 --> 05:21:17.100
Are you not doing the quiz? Are you just bing-chilling out there? Bing-chilling.

05:21:19.740 --> 05:21:20.940
Are you not sure what to do?

05:21:24.380 --> 05:21:27.740
Okay, and then one-by-one, we painfully go through this door again.

05:21:29.500 --> 05:21:36.300
Now we're getting waving hello, hello. Okay, we need to check out the fireplace. Okay, or also known as the heart.

05:21:36.300 --> 05:21:42.220
Oh wait, this is chopped on tree. Examine the fireplace with a knife. Use the knife on the fireplace.

05:21:43.660 --> 05:21:47.980
You use the knife to pry open a loose brick in the fireplace, revealing a secret panel

05:21:49.500 --> 05:21:55.180
Search fireplace. You find a panel of switches inside the hidden compartment.

05:21:55.180 --> 05:21:58.060
Each switch is crafted from a different gemstone.

05:21:58.620 --> 05:22:21.580
Click sapphire. Click diamonds. Click zanyate. Click emerald. Click on it. Then click ruby.

05:22:22.300 --> 05:22:26.300
Blue, white, orange, green, black, red.

05:22:28.220 --> 05:22:32.700
You hear a click sound. You find a hidden key. Okay, that one's a bit more.

05:22:34.620 --> 05:22:42.220
SD, Z, E, autumn. How are you supposed to figure that out? I love riddles in this game.

05:22:42.220 --> 05:22:48.140
Must have been the wind. Would you be upset if it was ink you were cleaning instead?

05:22:49.100 --> 05:22:51.980
Oh man, I can't believe this. I can't find my old character anymore.

05:22:51.980 --> 05:22:58.940
I wanted to bring in a high-level character to help out. I don't worry. Also, there's a boss fight now.

05:23:01.180 --> 05:23:05.900
I don't have any combat. The final letters of the note.

05:23:05.900 --> 05:23:18.540
Oh, I have the final word in this form.

05:23:21.100 --> 05:23:27.660
Okay, okay, that's actually wee bit smart. I'll give it a wee bit smart.

05:23:27.660 --> 05:23:32.460
Just a wee bit. One by one door. One by one door.

05:23:32.460 --> 05:23:37.100
One by one door. One by one. Cheeky one by one. Oh wait, is everyone done with the hearth?

05:23:37.100 --> 05:23:38.620
God, you guys were so quick at the hearth.

05:23:41.340 --> 05:23:45.180
Okay, Cheeky. Cheeky one by one door. That's it. Let me in.

05:23:45.180 --> 05:23:48.940
Stop! You don't even need to come in this room. You've already done the quest.

05:23:48.940 --> 05:23:54.700
Bruv, I don't have high enough ping. I can't get out. I actually don't have high enough ping

05:23:54.700 --> 05:24:01.500
to get out. I'm not even being funny. My ping is so bad. I can't get out. Bruv.

05:24:03.420 --> 05:24:07.900
I don't know what to do. My ping isn't fast enough to respond.

05:24:10.140 --> 05:24:14.860
The background keeps reminding me of the godfather. I've never seen the godfather. Is it gay?

05:24:16.540 --> 05:24:23.900
Fail to solve the final letters of this quiz. Fail to solve the- Ah, okay, okay. Oh, okay, it works.

05:24:24.460 --> 05:24:27.500
Okay. Alright, in you go.

05:24:27.980 --> 05:24:32.380
Right, once we're back in the engine's way, we one by one on the door over here.

05:24:33.020 --> 05:24:34.220
We're spinning on the door.

05:24:38.060 --> 05:24:42.140
Let's refling. Here we go. And then we go. Boom.

05:24:45.740 --> 05:24:51.260
We got a cutscene. I wonder if there's a way to make the text bigger.

05:24:51.260 --> 05:24:52.540
Show yourself, you coward.

05:24:53.260 --> 05:24:56.220
Monkey. Monkey, is someone gonna get stuff?

05:25:00.300 --> 05:25:04.460
So, we meet at last. I have to say, I'm impressed you worked out my riddles. Well,

05:25:04.460 --> 05:25:09.340
maybe you aren't as smart as you think you are. Or really, all the dead bodies suggest otherwise.

05:25:09.900 --> 05:25:16.620
And what did you do to stop them? Nothing. People think you are some big hero, but no,

05:25:16.620 --> 05:25:22.140
you're not. All your adventures are the same. Nothing but opportunists. What are you on about?

05:25:22.140 --> 05:25:25.820
Well, I did have this big speech planned out, but quite frankly,

05:25:25.820 --> 05:25:28.460
I don't think you're worth the effort it would take to deliver it.

05:25:29.420 --> 05:25:33.340
So, this is the end of the line for you. It is time for the final act.

05:25:33.340 --> 05:25:37.740
The showdown. The finale. Let's see if you're up for the challenge.

05:25:41.500 --> 05:25:48.140
Probably not. I'm too- Ah, if I die, do I lose all the money that's on my hand? Push mirror.

05:25:53.100 --> 05:25:56.300
The mirror can't be pushed any further. What are you on about?

05:25:59.100 --> 05:26:03.500
Oh no, I missed. Wait, is there like a timer?

05:26:05.900 --> 05:26:12.780
Hello? Oh. Logic puzzle? Wait, do I need to like-

05:26:12.780 --> 05:26:18.380
Do it all the time? Wait, hold on. Push. And then push. And then push from here.

05:26:18.380 --> 05:26:26.780
Boom. Oh, what? He changed. I don't know which one he's coming from.

05:26:29.820 --> 05:26:30.860
Did I just have to guess?

05:26:33.900 --> 05:26:36.620
Oh, for goodness- Wait, I can't see when it's coming.

05:26:39.900 --> 05:26:45.500
Is it that one? I think I'm too. Like, can you just randomize to this one where I've already

05:26:45.500 --> 05:26:52.380
said it all? Please, that'd be great game. Wait, I'm supposed to run about that fast?

05:26:53.180 --> 05:26:57.820
I don't think I'm that fast. I'm fricking too late.

05:26:59.900 --> 05:27:04.860
And- Oh, right. Okay, there's like a weird shadow thing, but I don't know if I'm that fast.

05:27:04.860 --> 05:27:09.100
Seriously. I'm not that fast! Oh.

05:27:09.980 --> 05:27:25.180
Bruv. Did I just need to camp at one? He's too fast! Oh my god, he's like so fast!

05:27:27.820 --> 05:27:33.980
Hold on. Oh, please be it. Oh no!

05:27:34.940 --> 05:27:44.060
Oh, right, okay. Wait, I don't even know where it's coming from. Oh, right, okay. Shadow, shadow.

05:27:45.100 --> 05:27:48.380
Okay, he's doing it again from that one. Okay, okay. Quick, quick, quick!

05:27:51.340 --> 05:27:56.700
Is it- Oh, shit, I'm too- Please be this one. No!

05:27:57.980 --> 05:28:02.220
The randomizer is so cruel. You know for a fact you can randomize elsewhere.

05:28:03.180 --> 05:28:09.740
Okay, another one, another one. Oh, dang right out. All right, okay, okay, okay,

05:28:09.740 --> 05:28:19.660
we can do this, we can do this. One, two, and three. Oh, just in time. Oh, we did it.

05:28:24.220 --> 05:28:27.740
I flopped out. Oh, I think I may have underestimated you.

05:28:28.540 --> 05:28:36.140
You lost at your own game and now it is time to see who you really are under that mask.

05:28:39.420 --> 05:28:44.620
Wait, no, you, but why? Why on earth would you kill all your pals? Why beg me to come here and help

05:28:44.620 --> 05:28:52.540
them? You just don't get it, do you? So big-headed, so used to it all being about you, about saving the

05:28:52.540 --> 05:28:58.220
day. Well, I'm sick of it. What do you even mean? Adventurers, you're all the same. Everything

05:28:58.220 --> 05:29:03.260
always has to be about you. I don't understand. Of course you wouldn't, because you can't see

05:29:03.260 --> 05:29:11.420
past yourself. Believe it or not, I used to be like- Okay, at least to be like you, I hear about

05:29:11.420 --> 05:29:18.860
some dance alone distress and go to help. Have my moment for me to be the hero for once. But you,

05:29:18.940 --> 05:29:23.420
you and every other adventurer, every time I get there to help is too late.

05:29:23.420 --> 05:29:29.260
It's already solved. The disaster is averted. Reward has already been claimed. Every time you

05:29:29.260 --> 05:29:35.980
and those adventurers steal my moment, but not this time. This time, it's all about me. I'm the

05:29:35.980 --> 05:29:43.180
star of the show. Me, me, me, me, me. Well, not any longer. The show's over and there will be no

05:29:43.180 --> 05:29:48.300
curtain call. Oh, but there's always a curtain call. He he he he.

05:29:52.540 --> 05:29:54.300
What? How? There was two?

05:29:57.980 --> 05:30:02.300
Of course. Every good show needs a good support and actor. Now take off your mask, darling. Take

05:30:02.300 --> 05:30:09.260
a bow. You've earned it. Of course, my love. It's Sid! No, it's not. It's Harvey. I'm sorry.

05:30:10.140 --> 05:30:14.220
You, but how? You were almost heckin' gone. I saw your wounds.

05:30:15.580 --> 05:30:22.060
No, what you watched was what I wanted you to watch. A masterful performance, if I say so myself.

05:30:22.060 --> 05:30:26.940
But what's in it for you? Everyone loves the limelight and who better to share it with

05:30:26.940 --> 05:30:32.700
them, my beloved Abigail. But your friends? They didn't deserve to perish.

05:30:34.060 --> 05:30:38.860
Perhaps not, but neither did I deserve to be cast back into the shadows where I deserve the

05:30:38.860 --> 05:30:47.580
spotlight. Yes, well, we deserve the spotlight. And now I have my starring role, our starring role.

05:30:48.540 --> 05:30:51.660
Gelinor will forever remember this night and what I've done here.

05:30:54.140 --> 05:31:05.340
No, what we have done. Quiet Huey, this is my moment. No, this is supposed to be our moment.

05:31:06.300 --> 05:31:09.660
It isn't just all about you either. We're in this together.

05:31:10.460 --> 05:31:15.580
Stop ruining this, Huey. I have worked so hard for this and I'm not gonna let you take it away from

05:31:15.580 --> 05:31:22.860
me. Well, I'm not gonna be push aside either. We were both in on this as equals. We were never

05:31:22.860 --> 05:31:30.860
equals. How could you possibly compare to me? You're egotistical, selfish. No, my love.

05:31:31.100 --> 05:31:41.820
No, what have I done? It wasn't supposed to be like this, but you just couldn't let me have my

05:31:41.820 --> 05:31:50.540
moment. Why, Huey, why? I loved you. This could be my chance to take advantage of the situation.

05:31:51.660 --> 05:31:57.900
Okay, pick up the knife. I'm not going out of her empty-handed. Yeah, pick up, take the killer's knife.

05:31:58.460 --> 05:32:04.860
Yonk and I'm not go- wait, equip the knife, pick up the knife and equip it and then stab her.

05:32:05.820 --> 05:32:13.180
Take that, hack and slash. Well, thanks Sarah Domen. That's over. I should get out of here.

05:32:15.260 --> 05:32:22.060
Just like that. Are they still alive? I don't think he's in a very talkative mood. Are they both?

05:32:22.060 --> 05:32:25.740
Okay. Okay, let's get out of here. Let's get out. Let's get out.

05:32:28.220 --> 05:32:32.540
The crying says, you'll never escape me.

05:32:34.940 --> 05:32:43.340
You dare try and ruin- wait, what? NPC spot? Isn't she supposed to be parish? Try and ruin my moment.

05:32:43.340 --> 05:32:51.260
Oh, wait, no. Huey is hurt because of you. It's definitely to you. Oh, wait. Now it's time for

05:32:51.260 --> 05:32:56.700
you to join. Oh, you're not killing anyone else. Oh, again, absolutely. She's spanked by the-

05:32:59.580 --> 05:33:03.580
No, this can't be. She just got specked. Whoa, that was close.

05:33:04.780 --> 05:33:10.300
Mandy, how are you alive? I watched you get shanked. I did get stabbed, but I was born with a rare

05:33:10.300 --> 05:33:19.500
condition called Dextrocardia. Dextrocardia what? Dextrocardia. It means that my heart is on the

05:33:19.500 --> 05:33:24.460
right side of my chest, not my left. Oh, that's so specific. So when the killers thought they stabbed

05:33:24.460 --> 05:33:29.660
you in the heart, they actually missed? Well, missed the heart, yeah. I did still get stabbed,

05:33:29.660 --> 05:33:35.900
though. I'm actually feeling pretty woozy. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. I will wait outside the house

05:33:35.900 --> 05:33:40.940
after seeing to this stab wound. You should come talk to me there. Okay, okay, okay.

05:33:41.660 --> 05:33:49.260
Hey, right, outside the house if my- Oh, no, are you guys stuck on the mirror section?

05:33:51.100 --> 05:33:54.620
Are they stuck on the mirror section if they're still in here? Or are they just in the cutscene?

05:33:56.860 --> 05:34:00.540
Someone throw in their snowball. I'm starting to think you aren't throwing snowballs anymore.

05:34:00.540 --> 05:34:04.700
No witnesses, the roofling's never taught. My medieval fantasy game with medieval-

05:34:04.700 --> 05:34:10.380
Oh, my medieval fantasy game with medical term. There's still one more roofling stuck in there.

05:34:11.900 --> 05:34:17.020
Are you stuck on the mirror quest, beyond it? I'm on team finish faster than throwing it. I need to

05:34:17.020 --> 05:34:30.620
read it out. I don't think these are snowballs I'm getting covered in or something. Should I have

05:34:30.620 --> 05:34:37.260
fought Abigail? You pick up a knife. Oh, did you just leave? You might have to go back inside

05:34:37.260 --> 05:34:41.100
and redo that mirror section sadly. Whoa, wait, it's okay.

05:34:45.260 --> 05:34:50.620
I mean, did you shank her? All right. Oh, the roofling's out. Is that everyone?

05:34:51.980 --> 05:34:58.220
All the candles floor, all aboard. Oh, we're talking about humors and bail there.

05:35:00.620 --> 05:35:03.820
Okay, that's all the rooflings. Everyone into the entrance way.

05:35:04.620 --> 05:35:10.300
Turns out you can't fight her. Nah, you don't actually hurt Abigail yourself.

05:35:11.740 --> 05:35:15.900
Right, and then we talk. Oh, no, it's one by one door. Oh, it's our biggest enemy. It's

05:35:15.900 --> 05:35:23.500
literally our biggest enemy right now, one by one door. The game's like sending me away.

05:35:24.140 --> 05:35:30.140
Right, I'll wait for the rooflings to go first. I'll let the rooflings go because they've been

05:35:30.620 --> 05:35:36.620
playing with me without having a go time. No witnesses, the rooflings will never talk.

05:35:37.180 --> 05:35:42.780
Fair and square. The actual end boss of the game. I don't think there's snowballs either,

05:35:42.780 --> 05:35:50.620
but they may contain some terms in common. All done. Okay, we need to talk to the

05:35:50.620 --> 05:35:55.900
Mandy right here. Oh, hi, Scottlefish. Hi, Mandy. How are you feeling now? Much better.

05:35:55.900 --> 05:36:00.460
Thanks and lucky to be alive. Thanks to you. No small part. Well, we saved the day in the

05:36:00.460 --> 05:36:05.260
team, so thank you too. Here, I found this in the wardrobe. I don't want to take it,

05:36:05.260 --> 05:36:13.740
so please take it. We did it! We got another quest for level eight crafting and we got rubies for

05:36:13.740 --> 05:36:22.380
it. I like that. Well, I think we're ready to go back. Is everyone ready once you've collected

05:36:22.380 --> 05:36:30.380
your mission? The question is, what quest do we do now? We'll do the free quests.

05:36:32.380 --> 05:36:35.660
I'm level nine crafting. I went, oh yeah, you're just rubbing in my face.

05:36:38.300 --> 05:36:42.700
Looks like everyone's spoken to Mandy, almost. A few more wheat funds.

05:36:45.740 --> 05:36:51.500
Someone's really enjoying just talking to all the wood. Is that everyone? I'm just trying to check.

05:36:52.700 --> 05:37:00.700
Are you coming too? No? Yeah, no, maybe. Right, all aboard the boat.

05:37:04.060 --> 05:37:08.860
Who do I talk to to finish the quest? Mandy, she's outside that castle.

05:37:10.220 --> 05:37:14.540
Yeah, we did it! We did it! Wait, wait, let me do a celebration of moat. Can I jump in the air?

05:37:15.500 --> 05:37:16.700
We completed the quest!

05:37:25.180 --> 05:37:32.140
Okay, I think we should go to the bank

05:37:33.500 --> 05:37:38.060
and put all our items away and then we'll pick what quest to do next. What's a free quest?

05:37:38.060 --> 05:37:43.580
That's easy. Goblin Diplomacy is pretty easy.

05:37:43.580 --> 05:37:49.260
Erin is the chicken. I think you need to have combat. I think you need combat for Erin.

05:37:49.980 --> 05:37:52.140
Sleep well, good night, those who have to go.

05:37:55.100 --> 05:38:01.100
Good night, Trony. We'll see you there, Bessa. Until later, I don't know if there's anything easy.

05:38:01.100 --> 05:38:03.740
Erin is the chicken. It's probably the easiest we've got right now.

05:38:04.700 --> 05:38:09.820
I think we need to level up, so that's not only why we need to level up.

05:38:10.860 --> 05:38:12.220
Just a runaway segment.

05:38:14.700 --> 05:38:16.620
All kind. It's all the refunds here.

05:38:23.100 --> 05:38:25.180
Yeah, I've got some stuff to do. Try not to get food.

05:38:25.180 --> 05:38:28.700
For those who have to go, don't worry if you have to go. Understand, it's not possible.

05:38:28.700 --> 05:38:33.020
We'll do Erin is the chicken and then we're going to go back to fishing.

05:38:33.100 --> 05:38:35.260
Sorry, we're going to go back to leveling up cooking.

05:38:38.860 --> 05:38:40.940
Okay, is everyone here? I think everyone's here.

05:38:42.140 --> 05:38:44.700
I don't know if that other refling is still stuck on the island.

05:38:45.900 --> 05:38:50.620
Possibly. That went crazy. Didn't we just see him back on this island?

05:38:52.940 --> 05:38:55.420
Wait, there is a refling that got stuck on that quest? I think.

05:38:56.380 --> 05:38:57.500
It's called scrawny sea.

05:38:59.980 --> 05:39:03.500
Oh no, that was a good thing. Okay, see you later. Bye bye refling.

05:39:03.500 --> 05:39:07.020
Thank you for joining for the ones who have to leave. Don't worry if you have to leave in game.

05:39:07.580 --> 05:39:11.820
Right, if you want to follow me, if you hover on me, it should say follow.

05:39:13.100 --> 05:39:16.940
And then I'll take you to the bank and then we'll do Erin is the chicken.

05:39:16.940 --> 05:39:18.700
I don't know what is, but we'll do it anyway.

05:39:19.500 --> 05:39:21.660
Oh, I'll walk. Sorry, I'll walk. I always forget to walk.

05:39:22.860 --> 05:39:24.540
We've got a refling army, honestly.

05:39:25.980 --> 05:39:30.940
See you later alligator in a wild crocodile.

05:39:32.380 --> 05:39:35.900
Yeah, I want to, I want to go to the island.

05:39:36.940 --> 05:39:41.100
Why would you let me go? Did you guys see that Stephen Hawking meme?

05:39:41.100 --> 05:39:46.380
That sounds really terrible, but that's what the meme was.

05:39:47.740 --> 05:39:50.780
So when it came out that Stephen Hawking went on the island,

05:39:50.780 --> 05:39:54.140
someone like did a quote and it was like, I want to go to the island.

05:39:54.140 --> 05:39:55.180
Why won't you let me go?

05:40:00.140 --> 05:40:01.500
Oh, I just love the brave word.

05:40:02.300 --> 05:40:05.580
I know the stream isn't over yet, but when do you think the next runescape won?

05:40:05.580 --> 05:40:07.500
Probably in a week's time.

05:40:08.220 --> 05:40:11.500
My endurance stream is Skyrim for next week,

05:40:12.300 --> 05:40:15.660
but I am going to try and get 99th cooking.

05:40:15.660 --> 05:40:16.700
Where am I trying to go?

05:40:16.700 --> 05:40:19.180
I don't know why I need the map to go to the bank and all the bankers.

05:40:19.820 --> 05:40:23.260
My next, I'm going to try and finish 99 cooking.

05:40:24.140 --> 05:40:30.220
In one month, I want to finish 99 cooking.

05:40:31.500 --> 05:40:32.940
Bobby Lee or whatever.

05:40:32.940 --> 05:40:34.060
Yeah, yeah, that was it.

05:40:35.100 --> 05:40:39.260
No, it's just going to be vanilla Skyrim for my endurance stream next week.

05:40:39.260 --> 05:40:42.140
Endurance stream next week is Skyrim and Runescape.

05:40:43.260 --> 05:40:46.140
I don't think today we're going to do the full 12 hours

05:40:46.140 --> 05:40:48.220
because I've actually done quite a lot of 12 hours.

05:40:48.220 --> 05:40:50.060
Go upstairs on the top of the bank.

05:40:50.060 --> 05:40:51.260
How are you everywhere?

05:40:51.260 --> 05:40:53.500
Am I going crazy or is this a bot?

05:40:53.500 --> 05:40:56.140
Or is this a leafling that like is just no,

05:40:56.140 --> 05:40:58.460
like how are you leveling up outside here?

05:40:58.460 --> 05:40:59.740
What we didn't even get here.

05:41:00.620 --> 05:41:01.420
I'm going crazy.

05:41:01.420 --> 05:41:02.540
I swear that's a leafling.

05:41:03.260 --> 05:41:03.740
Right.

05:41:03.740 --> 05:41:05.740
Empty everything inside.

05:41:06.780 --> 05:41:10.700
I guess you can just drop the notes from that minigame.

05:41:14.060 --> 05:41:15.340
And then Erin is the chicken.

05:41:15.340 --> 05:41:18.460
I'm actually going to equip my sword and shield.

05:41:18.460 --> 05:41:21.180
I'm pretty sure I got unequipped for some reason

05:41:21.180 --> 05:41:23.180
and I don't want to be completely defenseless.

05:41:23.980 --> 05:41:24.780
I'm not out there.

05:41:24.780 --> 05:41:27.100
I think we just draw destroy you, I guess.

05:41:31.900 --> 05:41:34.940
Wait, am I not allowed to destroy the notes?

05:41:35.660 --> 05:41:37.100
They'll just put them in the bank then.

05:41:37.980 --> 05:41:39.340
Okay, I'm just putting the notes in the bank.

05:41:39.340 --> 05:41:39.980
I don't know why.

05:41:40.620 --> 05:41:41.340
No, that's me.

05:41:41.340 --> 05:41:41.820
All right.

05:41:41.820 --> 05:41:42.700
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:41:44.300 --> 05:41:45.500
I can just what I was like,

05:41:45.500 --> 05:41:47.660
I'm sure that's a leafling genuinely.

05:41:47.660 --> 05:41:50.060
Anyone want my three gems since I can't bank them?

05:41:50.060 --> 05:41:51.580
Oh, me, me, me, me, me, me.

05:41:51.660 --> 05:41:53.500
Send them to Mommy who said that.

05:41:54.300 --> 05:41:55.420
Me, me, me, me, me, head a...

05:41:55.420 --> 05:41:56.300
Ah, I can't trade you.

05:41:56.300 --> 05:41:56.940
What?

05:41:56.940 --> 05:41:58.060
Oh, I've only traded you?

05:41:59.900 --> 05:42:02.060
Oh, well, at least you can send it to me at least.

05:42:02.060 --> 05:42:04.380
Yeah, I dunno why I wouldn't want me to do that.

05:42:04.380 --> 05:42:06.060
Me, me, me, me, me.

05:42:06.060 --> 05:42:07.180
Oh, my god, my, my, my, my, no.

05:42:09.580 --> 05:42:13.340
We should fight the level 152 chicken at the gate, ill.

05:42:13.340 --> 05:42:13.980
Is that true?

05:42:13.980 --> 05:42:14.620
Is that real?

05:42:15.260 --> 05:42:16.220
I don't mean to alarm you,

05:42:16.220 --> 05:42:17.740
but NaNNa and Cookin make take...

05:42:17.740 --> 05:42:20.300
Someone said it can take 30 hours if we max it.

05:42:21.580 --> 05:42:26.260
I can't trade for another 52 minutes, that's okay.

05:42:26.260 --> 05:42:34.900
Err, right, erm, Ern is the chicken, we're gonna do Big Ernie the checkin' buck buck

05:42:34.900 --> 05:42:37.180
er, show on the map.

05:42:37.180 --> 05:42:43.180
We need to go, oooh, outside this location here.

05:42:43.180 --> 05:42:44.660
I don't know, do we level up?

05:42:44.660 --> 05:42:47.660
I feel like we need to do a bit of combat.

05:42:48.620 --> 05:42:55.420
Well we go kill cows for like, I'm not even kidding, we'll go, er, kill cows for like,

05:42:55.420 --> 05:42:56.420
five minutes.

05:42:56.420 --> 05:42:59.980
So we're gonna go across the bridge and get cows.

05:42:59.980 --> 05:43:04.460
Reeflings, come down to the castle, I'll wait for you at the front of the castle.

05:43:04.460 --> 05:43:09.020
Make sure you have a sword and a shield equipped, did you got it from Tutorial Island.

05:43:09.020 --> 05:43:13.460
A hundred hours are five strong streams of frogs in the lake!

05:43:13.460 --> 05:43:14.460
Honestly.

05:43:17.900 --> 05:43:25.500
Yeah, we go, right, we will just go outside the castello, er, and I'll make sure everyone,

05:43:25.500 --> 05:43:29.460
I don't see anyone coming down the stairs from there, I think there's no one.

05:43:29.460 --> 05:43:34.140
Everyone's on, you guys are quick, I don't think there's anyone, I don't see anyone.

05:43:34.140 --> 05:43:40.500
Okay, we're gonna cross the bridge, five streams must be short ones, honestly, er, just five

05:43:40.500 --> 05:43:41.500
streams.

05:43:42.340 --> 05:43:43.340
Ugh.

05:43:45.340 --> 05:43:47.340
Give me one second, I'm getting...

05:43:47.340 --> 05:43:49.340
I'm not gonna do this.

05:43:49.340 --> 05:43:53.340
Nine streams, one minute is like absolutely all of this.

05:43:53.340 --> 05:43:55.340
I'm getting...

05:43:57.340 --> 05:43:59.340
I'm getting a freaking seal, what?

05:43:59.340 --> 05:44:02.340
I'm getting a big difference.

05:44:02.340 --> 05:44:03.340
Ugh.

05:44:03.340 --> 05:44:05.340
Okay, I can breathe again.

05:44:06.180 --> 05:44:12.580
Right, we're gonna go into the cow's pen, and we're literally gonna go nuts in destroying

05:44:12.580 --> 05:44:14.180
all these cows up ahead.

05:44:14.180 --> 05:44:22.740
Okay, just so some people get nine in cooking by at skill 33 with 6,000 grapes and turning

05:44:22.740 --> 05:44:23.740
them into wine.

05:44:23.740 --> 05:44:25.580
Is that the fastest ice pee maker?

05:44:25.580 --> 05:44:28.180
I thought it was sharks, but sharks are expensive.

05:44:28.180 --> 05:44:29.180
Me.

05:44:29.180 --> 05:44:33.180
Oh, someone wants to trade, sorry, sorry, I didn't see the offer.

05:44:33.180 --> 05:44:35.180
What do you offer me?

05:44:36.020 --> 05:44:37.020
Poison?

05:44:37.020 --> 05:44:39.020
Are you telling me killing them?

05:44:39.020 --> 05:44:41.020
Oh my God, what did you do?

05:44:41.020 --> 05:44:43.020
Poison and fish food.

05:44:43.020 --> 05:44:44.020
Reefland!

05:44:44.020 --> 05:44:46.020
That's so mean!

05:44:46.020 --> 05:44:50.020
I got given poison and freaking fish food.

05:44:50.020 --> 05:44:54.020
Tell me, tell me you don't like me, without telling me you don't like me, Reefland.

05:44:54.020 --> 05:44:55.020
Sheesh.

05:44:55.020 --> 05:44:59.020
Right, let's absolutely destroy these cows.

05:44:59.020 --> 05:45:03.780
Even if you just get a few, like to level up, I guess.

05:45:03.820 --> 05:45:06.820
Even a tiny bit of a level up is better than nothing.

05:45:06.820 --> 05:45:09.820
Something about not being able to burn wine?

05:45:09.820 --> 05:45:12.820
Wine making's the fastest.

05:45:12.820 --> 05:45:13.820
Okay.

05:45:16.820 --> 05:45:19.820
Based Reefland, someone said.

05:45:19.820 --> 05:45:25.820
Okay, just get the cows, just attack the cows at all willy nilly.

05:45:25.820 --> 05:45:32.820
And then we can level up our combat a bit, because our combat is so low that we're like

05:45:32.860 --> 05:45:35.860
really vulnerable to pretty much anything.

05:45:35.860 --> 05:45:37.860
Destroy that Reefland.

05:45:37.860 --> 05:45:39.860
Mods, slap them silly.

05:45:39.860 --> 05:45:41.860
Mods, remove this man's chest.

05:45:43.860 --> 05:45:45.860
Just cult things.

05:45:47.860 --> 05:45:49.860
Why you following this noob?

05:45:49.860 --> 05:45:51.860
Just cult things.

05:45:51.860 --> 05:45:53.860
Okay, I love that answer.

05:45:53.860 --> 05:45:55.860
Is there more cows over here?

05:45:55.860 --> 05:45:56.860
Oh, there is!

05:45:56.860 --> 05:45:57.860
There's like tons of cows.

05:45:57.860 --> 05:46:00.860
Okay, and don't worry, you can attack everything in this field.

05:46:00.900 --> 05:46:02.900
We'll just level up.

05:46:02.900 --> 05:46:04.900
Oh, he said enjoy.

05:46:06.900 --> 05:46:08.900
We will hunt them down.

05:46:08.900 --> 05:46:13.900
Mods, put chewed up gum in this, in his best shoes.

05:46:14.900 --> 05:46:17.900
Mods, make sure his pillow is always warm.

05:46:19.900 --> 05:46:20.900
Yeah.

05:46:20.900 --> 05:46:22.900
See, we're like literally already covered.

05:46:22.900 --> 05:46:24.900
We're getting so strong.

05:46:24.900 --> 05:46:27.900
We're just beating absolutely everything up.

05:46:30.900 --> 05:46:33.900
Why did, actually, how did they know I'm a noob?

05:46:33.900 --> 05:46:34.900
Is that the way I dress?

05:46:34.900 --> 05:46:39.900
I'm literally wearing a thousand gold dreads, and they called me a noob.

05:46:39.900 --> 05:46:42.900
Not to brag, but my combat level is five right now.

05:46:42.900 --> 05:46:47.900
Like, I'm sorry, but runescape players quake when they see me.

05:46:47.900 --> 05:46:49.900
I'm sorry, they just quake when they see me.

05:46:49.900 --> 05:46:50.900
They can't help it.

05:46:50.900 --> 05:46:52.900
Their timbers are shivered.

05:46:52.900 --> 05:46:55.900
Whenever they see skullfish log in online.

05:46:55.900 --> 05:46:57.900
Oh, I've only got four health.

05:46:57.900 --> 05:46:59.900
I should maybe be a bit more careful, honestly.

05:46:59.940 --> 05:47:01.940
Oh, I've only got three health.

05:47:01.940 --> 05:47:03.940
Maybe I should be really careful.

05:47:03.940 --> 05:47:11.940
Hmm, I'm not sure I can maybe fight the baby cows.

05:47:11.940 --> 05:47:15.940
If I get beaten up by a cow, I'm going to be really embarrassed, okay?

05:47:15.940 --> 05:47:18.940
Oh my god, a baby cow, destroy it.

05:47:18.940 --> 05:47:21.940
Combat level five, literally.

05:47:21.940 --> 05:47:26.940
We quiver before you as well, but for different reasons.

05:47:29.940 --> 05:47:34.940
Oh my god, the way that we think rolls over as well is so sad.

05:47:34.940 --> 05:47:37.940
I'm planting some booms.

05:47:37.940 --> 05:47:39.940
All right.

05:47:39.940 --> 05:47:42.940
I can only attack baby cows, because I've only got three HP.

05:47:42.940 --> 05:47:47.940
I swear, if any reefling perishes against cows, I'm going to be embarrassed for result, okay?

05:47:47.940 --> 05:47:49.940
Oh, sorry, someone said they wished to trade.

05:47:49.940 --> 05:47:50.940
Sorry, sorry.

05:47:50.940 --> 05:47:53.940
Let me beat up this baby cow, and then I'll accept the trade.

05:47:53.980 --> 05:47:57.980
Wah, wah, wah.

05:47:57.980 --> 05:47:59.980
Oh my god, I'm on one HP.

05:47:59.980 --> 05:48:01.980
No way this baby cow is going to get me.

05:48:01.980 --> 05:48:03.980
Mauds, are you...

05:48:03.980 --> 05:48:05.980
I'm going to get killed by a baby cow.

05:48:05.980 --> 05:48:08.980
I need to get out of the field, oh my god.

05:48:08.980 --> 05:48:10.980
I'm one HP in a dream.

05:48:10.980 --> 05:48:12.980
Hold on, right, let's try that again.

05:48:12.980 --> 05:48:16.980
Okay, I literally am the one that's going to perish from the cow.

05:48:16.980 --> 05:48:19.980
Hold on, let me accept this trade.

05:48:19.980 --> 05:48:21.980
I'm so sorry.

05:48:22.020 --> 05:48:24.020
Chin up, offer?

05:48:26.020 --> 05:48:28.020
Oh no, can you not trade?

05:48:28.020 --> 05:48:30.020
That's okay if you can't do it in time.

05:48:30.020 --> 05:48:34.020
Uh, I guess we'll just hang about here, yeah?

05:48:34.020 --> 05:48:35.020
We're just going to hang about...

05:48:35.020 --> 05:48:37.020
Oh, they're cooking meat.

05:48:37.020 --> 05:48:39.020
Cannot trade, yeah, I'm a new account.

05:48:39.020 --> 05:48:41.020
It's because I'm not cleaning up.

05:48:41.020 --> 05:48:43.020
Do you have meat?

05:48:43.020 --> 05:48:45.020
Excuse me, little reefling.

05:48:45.020 --> 05:48:48.020
Uh, can I get some of your meat?

05:48:48.060 --> 05:48:52.060
Please, one bit of meat so I can heal.

05:48:54.060 --> 05:48:56.060
Just one meat.

05:48:56.060 --> 05:48:57.060
Oh, you not got any?

05:48:57.060 --> 05:48:59.060
I saw you cooking though.

05:49:00.060 --> 05:49:02.060
I do not have any.

05:49:02.060 --> 05:49:06.060
Oh wait, I can make some if I pick up some off the ground.

05:49:06.060 --> 05:49:09.060
Wait a minute, hold on a minute, I can do it my...

05:49:09.060 --> 05:49:11.060
I'm an independent strummer.

05:49:11.060 --> 05:49:14.060
Use the meat on the fire and then eat the meat.

05:49:14.060 --> 05:49:16.060
It's genius.

05:49:16.100 --> 05:49:17.100
I did it!

05:49:17.100 --> 05:49:20.100
Okay, we can go back to slay and let's go.

05:49:20.100 --> 05:49:23.100
We'll get a few more combat levels like this.

05:49:23.100 --> 05:49:26.100
Chicken's going to only hit zero, so that's good for you, accounts.

05:49:26.100 --> 05:49:29.100
No, we need a challenge for the coup.

05:49:34.100 --> 05:49:36.100
Uh, we're now attack level four.

05:49:36.100 --> 05:49:38.100
Oh my god, we're getting too strong.

05:49:38.100 --> 05:49:40.100
We can't handle this.

05:49:40.100 --> 05:49:42.100
When we enter the lobby...

05:49:42.100 --> 05:49:45.100
I'm going to actually cook again because I want to heal up.

05:49:46.100 --> 05:49:47.100
GGG.

05:49:47.100 --> 05:49:50.100
I'm gaming so hard right now.

05:49:50.100 --> 05:49:52.100
Oh no, I burnt it!

05:49:52.100 --> 05:49:56.100
I thought we were high enough level not to burn level one me, honestly.

05:50:00.100 --> 05:50:02.100
I don't know what combat level we are.

05:50:02.100 --> 05:50:04.100
We're combat level five.

05:50:04.100 --> 05:50:06.100
Surely that's enough for questing.

05:50:06.100 --> 05:50:07.100
Surely.

05:50:07.100 --> 05:50:09.100
Copium.

05:50:09.100 --> 05:50:12.100
Let me know wild strong, you can survive in nature.

05:50:12.100 --> 05:50:15.100
It's rough out in nature, it's rough.

05:50:16.100 --> 05:50:20.100
I just need to heal and then I can start walloping everything again.

05:50:20.100 --> 05:50:22.100
There, boom.

05:50:22.100 --> 05:50:28.100
Uh, let me keep the attack or is it better to like swap between like the same thing, so...

05:50:28.100 --> 05:50:30.100
Cows can burn.

05:50:30.100 --> 05:50:32.100
It's genius!

05:50:32.100 --> 05:50:35.100
Shit over here.

05:50:35.100 --> 05:50:39.100
Why do the farmers randomly let you perish their cows?

05:50:39.100 --> 05:50:42.100
Honestly, I'm not even sure.

05:50:42.140 --> 05:50:50.140
Wait, I think it might be faster to do like strength and then I might get like a combat level faster.

05:50:50.140 --> 05:50:51.140
I'm not sure if that's right though.

05:50:51.140 --> 05:50:54.140
I could be completely wrong about that.

05:50:54.140 --> 05:50:57.140
Wait, there's like more cows over here, we can use annihilate.

05:50:57.140 --> 05:50:59.140
Yeah, there's like tons over here.

05:51:02.140 --> 05:51:04.140
Best to train strength.

05:51:04.180 --> 05:51:10.180
Alright, maybe defense because like I've not got much HP points.

05:51:10.180 --> 05:51:12.180
Like I only got 10.

05:51:12.180 --> 05:51:14.180
Oh sorry, someone wishes to trade with me.

05:51:14.180 --> 05:51:18.180
Drop some meat over here if you want to strong any things I can't trade.

05:51:18.180 --> 05:51:20.180
The reeflings feeding me.

05:51:20.180 --> 05:51:22.180
Oh, they're feeding me.

05:51:22.180 --> 05:51:24.180
Thank you reeflings.

05:51:24.180 --> 05:51:26.180
That's a lot of meat.

05:51:26.180 --> 05:51:28.180
Jeez, you're a packin.

05:51:28.180 --> 05:51:30.180
Is that six whole meat for me?

05:51:30.180 --> 05:51:32.180
It is, thank you.

05:51:32.220 --> 05:51:34.220
Am I baiting to it?

05:51:34.220 --> 05:51:36.220
Oh wait, I'm already full health.

05:51:36.220 --> 05:51:38.220
Wait, I only have 9 HP?

05:51:38.220 --> 05:51:40.220
No, I have 10 HP, that's like tiny.

05:51:40.220 --> 05:51:42.220
Azura remainder.

05:51:42.220 --> 05:51:44.220
Azura duly is going live.

05:51:44.220 --> 05:51:46.220
I'm unsure what game she's playing.

05:51:48.220 --> 05:51:50.220
Oh my god, check out the outfit.

05:51:50.220 --> 05:51:52.220
Check out the drip.

05:51:52.220 --> 05:51:54.220
Let's say drip out in the color scheme.

05:51:54.260 --> 05:51:56.260
We're getting there, we're getting there.

05:51:56.260 --> 05:51:58.260
Surely.

05:51:58.260 --> 05:52:00.260
Oh my god, do you know what that reminds me of?

05:52:00.260 --> 05:52:02.260
I think the reason why I laugh so much at that

05:52:02.260 --> 05:52:04.260
is because of this.

05:52:04.260 --> 05:52:06.260
Right, hear me out.

05:52:06.260 --> 05:52:08.260
Hear me out.

05:52:08.260 --> 05:52:10.260
Where is it?

05:52:10.260 --> 05:52:12.260
Let me find it.

05:52:12.260 --> 05:52:14.260
I think that's why that makes me laugh so much.

05:52:14.260 --> 05:52:16.260
Because it looks so good.

05:52:16.260 --> 05:52:18.260
Oh my god.

05:52:18.300 --> 05:52:20.300
Let me find it.

05:52:20.300 --> 05:52:22.300
I think that's why

05:52:22.300 --> 05:52:24.300
that makes me laugh so much.

05:52:24.300 --> 05:52:26.300
Because it looks so ridiculous.

05:52:26.300 --> 05:52:28.300
That's the only reason I like the headbanging

05:52:28.300 --> 05:52:30.300
the most.

05:52:32.300 --> 05:52:34.300
This is absolutely ridiculous.

05:52:40.300 --> 05:52:42.300
Wow.

05:52:42.300 --> 05:52:44.300
I don't know.

05:52:44.300 --> 05:52:46.300
Is level 6 combat enough to not get attacked

05:52:46.340 --> 05:52:48.340
all the time?

05:52:48.340 --> 05:52:50.340
Sorry, I look sussy.

05:52:50.340 --> 05:52:52.340
Sorry, I said that wrong.

05:52:52.340 --> 05:52:54.340
I don't mean to say it like that.

05:52:54.340 --> 05:52:56.340
Oh, I'm level 2 strength.

05:52:56.340 --> 05:52:58.340
Check me out.

05:52:58.340 --> 05:53:00.340
Oh sorry, someone wants to trade with me.

05:53:00.340 --> 05:53:02.340
I'm sorry, I missed it.

05:53:02.340 --> 05:53:04.340
I'm too fatigued.

05:53:04.340 --> 05:53:06.340
I'm too enthralled

05:53:06.340 --> 05:53:08.340
with perishing these cows to get some level ups.

05:53:08.340 --> 05:53:10.340
Very beefy.

05:53:10.340 --> 05:53:12.340
I'm sorry.

05:53:12.340 --> 05:53:14.340
Look, I've got things on my mind, you know.

05:53:14.380 --> 05:53:16.380
Are the marshmallows up again recently?

05:53:16.380 --> 05:53:18.380
Oh yeah.

05:53:18.380 --> 05:53:20.380
Hee hee hee.

05:53:22.380 --> 05:53:24.380
Okay.

05:53:24.380 --> 05:53:26.380
Accept trade.

05:53:26.380 --> 05:53:28.380
What? Show me what you got.

05:53:28.380 --> 05:53:30.380
Oh, it's a strength potion

05:53:30.380 --> 05:53:32.380
and cooked salmon.

05:53:32.380 --> 05:53:34.380
Okay.

05:53:34.380 --> 05:53:36.380
I don't know how long.

05:53:36.380 --> 05:53:38.380
I only wanted to be here for like a wee bit

05:53:38.380 --> 05:53:40.380
and then we'll go straight back in

05:53:40.380 --> 05:53:42.380
to leveling up cooking.

05:53:42.420 --> 05:53:44.420
I accidentally save questing a little too much.

05:53:44.420 --> 05:53:46.420
What I wanted to do was get some levels.

05:53:46.420 --> 05:53:48.420
So when we do airness to chicken,

05:53:48.420 --> 05:53:50.420
we don't all perish.

05:53:50.420 --> 05:53:52.420
I think we can run away

05:53:52.420 --> 05:53:54.420
for whatever is going on.

05:53:54.420 --> 05:53:56.420
Oh yeah, you know all right.

05:53:56.420 --> 05:53:58.420
Hee hee hee hee.

05:53:58.420 --> 05:54:00.420
I just didn't want us to perish

05:54:00.420 --> 05:54:02.420
really quickly when we did airness to chicken.

05:54:02.420 --> 05:54:04.420
I don't know what Azur is live with.

05:54:07.420 --> 05:54:09.420
Thank you very much, Refling,

05:54:09.420 --> 05:54:11.420
for all the food supplies as well.

05:54:11.460 --> 05:54:13.460
Um.

05:54:13.460 --> 05:54:15.460
Almost like up my strength.

05:54:15.460 --> 05:54:17.460
Level up, level up.

05:54:17.460 --> 05:54:19.460
Ooh.

05:54:19.460 --> 05:54:21.460
Combat level six, unstoppable.

05:54:21.460 --> 05:54:23.460
Truly unstoppable.

05:54:23.460 --> 05:54:25.460
They cannot, they cannot.

05:54:25.460 --> 05:54:27.460
Strength potion for stronger.

05:54:27.460 --> 05:54:29.460
Ah.

05:54:29.460 --> 05:54:31.460
Okay, I took a sip.

05:54:31.460 --> 05:54:33.460
I don't know how long it lasts.

05:54:33.460 --> 05:54:35.460
Wait, where's the effect?

05:54:35.460 --> 05:54:37.460
I don't know how long these things,

05:54:37.460 --> 05:54:39.460
the pots last.

05:54:39.500 --> 05:54:41.500
Ooh.

05:54:41.500 --> 05:54:43.500
I've cast up this much of a fate.

05:54:43.500 --> 05:54:45.500
I fear what bulls are capable of.

05:54:45.500 --> 05:54:47.500
She can now destroy baby cows with ease.

05:54:47.500 --> 05:54:49.500
I truly am evil.

05:54:49.500 --> 05:54:51.500
Truly.

05:54:51.500 --> 05:54:53.500
I don't know how long it lasts.

05:54:55.500 --> 05:54:57.500
Strength potion, yeah.

05:54:57.500 --> 05:54:59.500
Top left the fist.

05:54:59.500 --> 05:55:01.500
So the strength boosts.

05:55:03.500 --> 05:55:05.500
60 seconds?

05:55:05.500 --> 05:55:07.500
No, it does not last.

05:55:07.540 --> 05:55:09.540
It lasts 60 seconds.

05:55:09.540 --> 05:55:11.540
It's so small when you heal.

05:55:11.540 --> 05:55:13.540
Oh, salmon heals a lot, actually.

05:55:13.540 --> 05:55:15.540
We need to start like a salmon ring.

05:55:17.540 --> 05:55:19.540
Is it normal to heal multiple,

05:55:19.540 --> 05:55:21.540
strong voices simultaneously in my head?

05:55:21.540 --> 05:55:23.540
I hope not. If I left the echo on.

05:55:26.540 --> 05:55:28.540
One boosted start point,

05:55:28.540 --> 05:55:30.540
dreams every 30 seconds.

05:55:30.540 --> 05:55:32.540
That's so quick.

05:55:32.540 --> 05:55:34.540
Ooh.

05:55:34.540 --> 05:55:36.540
I'm no strength level four.

05:55:36.580 --> 05:55:38.580
I'm rolling these cows.

05:55:38.580 --> 05:55:40.580
There's no echo.

05:55:40.580 --> 05:55:42.580
Okay.

05:55:42.580 --> 05:55:44.580
It's just a reef flings finally losing the plot.

05:55:44.580 --> 05:55:46.580
I now can have a live in HP.

05:55:46.580 --> 05:55:48.580
Okay, maybe we should have done

05:55:48.580 --> 05:55:50.580
a bit of training a wee bit earlier.

05:55:50.580 --> 05:55:52.580
But look, we're leveling up.

05:55:52.580 --> 05:55:54.580
That's the main thing.

05:55:54.580 --> 05:55:56.580
We're getting there.

05:55:56.580 --> 05:55:58.580
I don't know if we should maybe go for like

05:55:58.580 --> 05:56:00.580
five.

05:56:02.580 --> 05:56:04.580
Hmm.

05:56:04.620 --> 05:56:06.620
I'm thinking he's becoming an extra strongy pill.

05:56:06.620 --> 05:56:09.620
So it depends on how strong your potion has boosted you.

05:56:09.620 --> 05:56:12.620
Azure is playing one shot.

05:56:12.620 --> 05:56:14.620
Like how strong he sounds excited

05:56:14.620 --> 05:56:16.620
every time she unlocks levels.

05:56:16.620 --> 05:56:18.620
It's so satisfying.

05:56:18.620 --> 05:56:20.620
It's like, you've unlocked a new level,

05:56:20.620 --> 05:56:22.620
but yeah, I have.

05:56:22.620 --> 05:56:24.620
I'm such a big girl.

05:56:24.620 --> 05:56:26.620
I'm so smart.

05:56:26.620 --> 05:56:28.620
It's MRT.

05:56:28.620 --> 05:56:30.620
Hmm.

05:56:30.620 --> 05:56:32.620
Hydration check.

05:56:32.660 --> 05:56:34.660
I think the echo effect,

05:56:34.660 --> 05:56:36.660
if I was playing a video game,

05:56:36.660 --> 05:56:38.660
doesn't sound that good.

05:56:38.660 --> 05:56:40.660
Like, this is, for example,

05:56:40.660 --> 05:56:42.660
what would sound like,

05:56:42.660 --> 05:56:44.660
oh, I'm just killing this dude right now.

05:56:44.660 --> 05:56:46.660
It just sounds mental.

05:56:46.660 --> 05:56:48.660
It sounds like you've lost the plot.

05:56:48.660 --> 05:56:50.660
You've actually lost the plot.

05:56:50.660 --> 05:56:52.660
It's not sounding good, you know?

05:56:52.660 --> 05:56:54.660
There.

05:56:54.660 --> 05:56:56.660
That should be it back to me.

05:56:56.660 --> 05:56:58.660
I think I got unsubtremised

05:56:58.660 --> 05:57:00.660
channel. It's very plausible.

05:57:00.700 --> 05:57:02.700
I think it should be in

05:57:02.700 --> 05:57:04.700
my description.

05:57:04.700 --> 05:57:06.700
Right, we'll do

05:57:06.700 --> 05:57:08.700
five defense.

05:57:08.700 --> 05:57:10.700
We're almost level seven combat.

05:57:10.700 --> 05:57:12.700
Let's go.

05:57:12.700 --> 05:57:14.700
Oh my god, Serenity!

05:57:16.700 --> 05:57:18.700
How are you doing? How was your stream?

05:57:18.700 --> 05:57:20.700
Even though you'll probably be exhausted

05:57:20.700 --> 05:57:22.700
and the last thing you want to do

05:57:22.700 --> 05:57:24.700
is get a ton of heck in comments

05:57:24.700 --> 05:57:26.700
and be like, I'm not making a stream.

05:57:26.700 --> 05:57:28.700
I don't know.

05:57:28.740 --> 05:57:30.740
How, hopefully it was good though

05:57:30.740 --> 05:57:32.740
and you had fun. Hi Raiders!

05:57:32.740 --> 05:57:34.740
I'm Strony Cuttles from Veiler

05:57:34.740 --> 05:57:36.740
and I'm currently doing

05:57:36.740 --> 05:57:38.740
my stream snipe game of the day,

05:57:38.740 --> 05:57:40.740
of the week, sorry.

05:57:40.740 --> 05:57:42.740
We're playing old-school Rinscape.

05:57:42.740 --> 05:57:44.740
We're in World 3a, which is free to play

05:57:44.740 --> 05:57:46.740
and we're just leveling up our accounts a little bit

05:57:46.740 --> 05:57:48.740
because we are super weak

05:57:48.740 --> 05:57:50.740
and I'm scared to

05:57:50.740 --> 05:57:52.740
send us quests, because someone might fall down.

05:57:54.740 --> 05:57:56.740
What level is your attack?

05:57:56.780 --> 05:57:58.780
My attack is four.

05:57:58.780 --> 05:58:00.780
Strength is five and defense is one.

05:58:00.780 --> 05:58:02.780
I'm currently doing defense right now.

05:58:02.780 --> 05:58:04.780
Just to try and get

05:58:04.780 --> 05:58:06.780
overall combat level.

05:58:06.780 --> 05:58:08.780
Speedy Bun Raid.

05:58:08.780 --> 05:58:10.780
I never saw Rinscape before.

05:58:10.780 --> 05:58:12.780
Oh, it's basically

05:58:12.780 --> 05:58:14.780
an incremental game

05:58:14.780 --> 05:58:16.780
and you just click.

05:58:16.780 --> 05:58:18.780
Literally, this is the graphics.

05:58:18.780 --> 05:58:20.780
I'm not even kidding, check me out.

05:58:20.780 --> 05:58:22.780
I've got a gold plated chef's hat on.

05:58:22.780 --> 05:58:24.780
Gold apron on.

05:58:24.820 --> 05:58:26.820
You've not seen anything bear.

05:58:26.820 --> 05:58:28.820
Just amazing.

05:58:28.820 --> 05:58:30.820
It's a sweetie bun raid.

05:58:30.820 --> 05:58:32.820
Bun bun raid.

05:58:34.820 --> 05:58:36.820
Help, I've fallen.

05:58:36.820 --> 05:58:38.820
I'm literally dropped out.

05:58:38.820 --> 05:58:40.820
Why did I get a message?

05:58:40.820 --> 05:58:42.820
I'll be logged in in 30 minutes.

05:58:42.820 --> 05:58:44.820
But yeah, we're just leveling up

05:58:44.820 --> 05:58:46.820
because

05:58:46.820 --> 05:58:48.820
we want to do some questions.

05:58:48.820 --> 05:58:50.820
That's weird.

05:58:50.820 --> 05:58:52.820
I always saw the YouTube make up

05:58:52.860 --> 05:58:54.860
that's not the default graphics.

05:58:54.860 --> 05:58:56.860
Oh, at least even worse

05:58:56.860 --> 05:58:58.860
than this.

05:58:58.860 --> 05:59:00.860
Oh, it's been six hours

05:59:00.860 --> 05:59:02.860
already. I didn't realize either.

05:59:02.860 --> 05:59:04.860
Sorry for stealing all your time, guys.

05:59:04.860 --> 05:59:07.860
Time flies when you're having fun.

05:59:07.860 --> 05:59:09.860
Time flies.

05:59:09.860 --> 05:59:11.860
This is peak graphics.

05:59:11.860 --> 05:59:13.860
You do not get better than this.

05:59:13.860 --> 05:59:15.860
The year is 2024.

05:59:15.860 --> 05:59:17.860
Let's admire

05:59:17.860 --> 05:59:19.860
the daisies right here.

05:59:19.860 --> 05:59:21.860
Let's zoom in a little.

05:59:21.900 --> 05:59:23.900
Look at these, man.

05:59:23.900 --> 05:59:25.900
Beautiful.

05:59:25.900 --> 05:59:27.900
You can see every poly...

05:59:27.900 --> 05:59:29.900
What's that, a poly thing?

05:59:29.900 --> 05:59:31.900
Every triangle.

05:59:31.900 --> 05:59:33.900
Oh.

05:59:33.900 --> 05:59:35.900
All the triangles are made out.

05:59:38.900 --> 05:59:40.900
Oh, I've reached

05:59:40.900 --> 05:59:42.900
a total level of 100.

05:59:42.900 --> 05:59:44.900
Ooh, our accounts are getting bear.

05:59:44.900 --> 05:59:46.900
We've

05:59:46.900 --> 05:59:48.900
started on fresh accounts.

05:59:48.940 --> 05:59:50.940
So, all that got censored.

05:59:50.940 --> 05:59:52.940
It did.

05:59:52.940 --> 05:59:54.940
Hold on, let me eat a salmon.

05:59:54.940 --> 05:59:56.940
Well, we're at combat level 7.

05:59:56.940 --> 05:59:58.940
Oh, we are getting potent.

05:59:58.940 --> 06:00:00.940
Okay.

06:00:00.940 --> 06:00:02.940
Polygon, that's what I meant.

06:00:02.940 --> 06:00:04.940
Yeah, polygon.

06:00:04.940 --> 06:00:06.940
But if anyone looks as funny,

06:00:06.940 --> 06:00:08.940
I'm gonna get them.

06:00:08.940 --> 06:00:10.940
Level 7, go and get them.

06:00:10.940 --> 06:00:12.940
They can't handle.

06:00:12.940 --> 06:00:14.940
They can't handle it.

06:00:14.940 --> 06:00:16.940
Laracraft,

06:00:16.980 --> 06:00:18.980
honestly.

06:00:18.980 --> 06:00:20.980
Okay, think

06:00:20.980 --> 06:00:22.980
we're getting there, we're getting there.

06:00:22.980 --> 06:00:24.980
Maybe we do 5 on each.

06:00:24.980 --> 06:00:26.980
Eat combat means

06:00:26.980 --> 06:00:28.980
we can survive a little bit of a hit.

06:00:28.980 --> 06:00:30.980
A little bit of a punch, if you will.

06:00:30.980 --> 06:00:32.980
Triangle.

06:00:32.980 --> 06:00:34.980
Oh, that should have been...

06:00:34.980 --> 06:00:36.980
Is there a other name?

06:00:38.980 --> 06:00:40.980
Yeah, we tricked everything.

06:00:40.980 --> 06:00:42.980
Wow.

06:00:42.980 --> 06:00:44.980
And then wherever Ernie's chicken starts,

06:00:45.020 --> 06:00:47.020
I'm actually unsure.

06:00:49.020 --> 06:00:51.020
Wow, level 4.

06:00:51.020 --> 06:00:53.020
Did I put my combat?

06:00:53.020 --> 06:00:55.020
We're at 7.6 for combat.

06:00:55.020 --> 06:00:57.020
I like how it shows you the increment as well.

06:00:57.020 --> 06:00:59.020
To be like, you're getting closer.

06:00:59.020 --> 06:01:01.020
I'm pretty sure prayer counts

06:01:01.020 --> 06:01:03.020
to your overall combat level as well.

06:01:03.020 --> 06:01:05.020
So, I hit Fondle of Triangles.

06:01:08.020 --> 06:01:10.020
So, I don't know if we should do some...

06:01:10.020 --> 06:01:12.020
I've never done...

06:01:12.020 --> 06:01:14.020
Is it the altar?

06:01:14.060 --> 06:01:16.060
Dragon bone altar run, but they're so expensive.

06:01:16.060 --> 06:01:18.060
And I would need personal guards

06:01:18.060 --> 06:01:20.060
all the way over.

06:01:23.060 --> 06:01:25.060
See, that's the fastest way

06:01:25.060 --> 06:01:27.060
to level up prayer, I believe.

06:01:27.060 --> 06:01:29.060
But yeah.

06:01:29.060 --> 06:01:31.060
Watching Stronny and Emile and Spirits

06:01:31.060 --> 06:01:33.060
playing a game on my own almost feels like

06:01:33.060 --> 06:01:35.060
I have a friend.

06:01:35.060 --> 06:01:37.060
Isn't there no sensory overload doing that?

06:01:37.060 --> 06:01:39.060
I feel like

06:01:39.060 --> 06:01:41.060
I'd be like, I couldn't handle it.

06:01:41.060 --> 06:01:43.060
I feel like there's too much going on.

06:01:44.060 --> 06:01:46.060
Is Emi enjoying her game so far?

06:01:54.060 --> 06:01:56.060
I already need a P again.

06:01:56.060 --> 06:01:58.060
I feel like whenever I have a T,

06:01:58.060 --> 06:02:00.060
she's loving it, oh, I'm glad.

06:02:00.060 --> 06:02:02.060
That's what I like to hear.

06:02:02.060 --> 06:02:04.060
See, I knew a picture.

06:02:04.060 --> 06:02:06.060
Oh, I'm level 4 health.

06:02:06.060 --> 06:02:08.060
Sorry, 4 HP.

06:02:08.060 --> 06:02:10.060
I think

06:02:10.060 --> 06:02:12.060
there's everyone at least level...

06:02:12.100 --> 06:02:14.100
So we've got level 6 refling.

06:02:14.100 --> 06:02:16.100
Yeah, that's good.

06:02:16.100 --> 06:02:18.100
Okay, apparently we get

06:02:18.100 --> 06:02:20.100
level 5 in attack.

06:02:20.100 --> 06:02:22.100
We're getting leveled up.

06:02:22.100 --> 06:02:24.100
We've got level 10 refling over there.

06:02:24.100 --> 06:02:26.100
I can't tell.

06:02:26.100 --> 06:02:28.100
We've got level 6 as well.

06:02:28.100 --> 06:02:30.100
Yeah, we're getting a bit better.

06:02:30.100 --> 06:02:32.100
Getting a bit better.

06:02:32.100 --> 06:02:34.100
We're definitely not to be tripled with

06:02:34.100 --> 06:02:36.100
even though we're not level 10 combat yet.

06:02:36.100 --> 06:02:38.100
But we're not to be missed with.

06:02:38.100 --> 06:02:40.100
How do you pee so much yet so little?

06:02:40.140 --> 06:02:43.140
I know that caffeine makes you want to wee-wee all the time.

06:02:43.140 --> 06:02:45.140
So I think it might be because I'm having

06:02:45.140 --> 06:02:47.140
so much T's from my throat.

06:02:48.140 --> 06:02:49.140
Yay!

06:02:49.140 --> 06:02:51.140
We're like doing little mini tasks as well.

06:02:57.140 --> 06:02:59.140
Someone wants to trade.

06:02:59.140 --> 06:03:01.140
You wish to trade. I accept your trade.

06:03:01.140 --> 06:03:03.140
What do you wish to trade me?

06:03:03.140 --> 06:03:06.140
Oh, I don't know if I can wear this, actually.

06:03:06.140 --> 06:03:08.140
I don't know if it's too...

06:03:08.180 --> 06:03:09.180
strong.

06:03:09.180 --> 06:03:11.180
Like, I can't wear it yet.

06:03:12.180 --> 06:03:15.180
I trade absolutely nothing.

06:03:15.180 --> 06:03:17.180
Oh no, I took my apron off.

06:03:17.180 --> 06:03:20.180
Oh my god, I have to pick between drip or function.

06:03:20.180 --> 06:03:22.180
I think I have to pick between drip.

06:03:22.180 --> 06:03:24.180
I'm so sorry.

06:03:24.180 --> 06:03:26.180
Do you want your steel plate body back?

06:03:28.180 --> 06:03:30.180
Sorry, the drip is for life.

06:03:30.180 --> 06:03:32.180
For real, for real. The drip is for life.

06:03:32.180 --> 06:03:34.180
I mean, check this out.

06:03:34.180 --> 06:03:36.180
I mean, check it out.

06:03:36.220 --> 06:03:38.220
It's so good. Okay, sure.

06:03:38.220 --> 06:03:40.220
You want to trade with me?

06:03:40.220 --> 06:03:42.220
I swear if it's more poison.

06:03:42.220 --> 06:03:44.220
What is this? Crossbow?

06:03:44.220 --> 06:03:46.220
Oh!

06:03:48.220 --> 06:03:50.220
Whoa!

06:03:50.220 --> 06:03:52.220
Wait, a pink skirt? Are you dressing me up?

06:03:52.220 --> 06:03:54.220
I can't believe reeflings are dressing me up.

06:03:54.220 --> 06:03:56.220
First cosplay stream confirmed.

06:03:56.220 --> 06:03:58.220
Oh, look at the long drip.

06:03:58.220 --> 06:04:00.220
I said Tee-hee.

06:04:00.220 --> 06:04:02.220
I said Tee-hee, you're not getting Tee.

06:04:02.220 --> 06:04:04.220
I put little crossbow ball tips on.

06:04:04.260 --> 06:04:06.260
Whoa!

06:04:06.260 --> 06:04:08.260
Okay, okay.

06:04:08.260 --> 06:04:10.260
Wait, I think the skamar is better.

06:04:10.260 --> 06:04:12.260
What is it called?

06:04:12.260 --> 06:04:14.260
A steel skamar.

06:04:14.260 --> 06:04:16.260
Okay.

06:04:16.260 --> 06:04:18.260
I've got skamar.

06:04:18.260 --> 06:04:20.260
I'm not afraid to use it.

06:04:20.260 --> 06:04:22.260
Even in the game,

06:04:22.260 --> 06:04:24.260
she has a dumpy, honestly.

06:04:24.260 --> 06:04:26.260
The pencil dress.

06:04:26.260 --> 06:04:28.260
Yeah, I mean, look at that.

06:04:28.260 --> 06:04:30.260
Wow, look at them polygons.

06:04:30.260 --> 06:04:32.260
Oh yeah, it's all coming together.

06:04:32.300 --> 06:04:34.300
Great.

06:04:34.300 --> 06:04:36.300
We will start airing as the chicken, I think.

06:04:36.300 --> 06:04:38.300
Oh, there's an imp.

06:04:38.300 --> 06:04:40.300
If I pick up a bead, I'm pretty sure.

06:04:40.300 --> 06:04:42.300
Beat that imp up.

06:04:42.300 --> 06:04:44.300
Or I'll beat it up.

06:04:44.300 --> 06:04:46.300
Don't worry, I'll get it.

06:04:46.300 --> 06:04:48.300
I don't want, I don't want because the cave's in the way.

06:04:48.300 --> 06:04:50.300
Okay, now we beat the imp up.

06:04:50.300 --> 06:04:52.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, beat him up.

06:04:52.300 --> 06:04:54.300
If he drops a colored bead,

06:04:54.300 --> 06:04:56.300
we can use it for the wizard quest.

06:04:56.300 --> 06:04:58.300
I just realized I never killed it,

06:04:58.300 --> 06:05:00.300
so I can't tell.

06:05:01.300 --> 06:05:03.300
We'll never know what it dropped.

06:05:03.300 --> 06:05:05.300
Oh wait, did it drop something?

06:05:07.300 --> 06:05:09.300
Oh, it did!

06:05:09.300 --> 06:05:11.300
Okay, we need it for the wizard tower quest,

06:05:11.300 --> 06:05:13.300
but completely forgotten,

06:05:13.300 --> 06:05:15.300
you need like four different components.

06:05:17.300 --> 06:05:20.300
What are the consequences of death in this game?

06:05:20.300 --> 06:05:22.300
I think you keep your three highest

06:05:22.300 --> 06:05:26.300
priced items or something like that.

06:05:26.300 --> 06:05:28.300
Right,

06:05:28.300 --> 06:05:31.300
the three reflings are,

06:05:31.300 --> 06:05:33.300
I'm going to stand at the gate,

06:05:33.300 --> 06:05:35.300
and I'll wait for everyone to come over.

06:05:35.300 --> 06:05:38.300
So if you want to stand outside the gate of the cow pen,

06:05:38.300 --> 06:05:40.300
we will go do Ernest the chicken next,

06:05:40.300 --> 06:05:44.300
and then we'll actually do some

06:05:44.300 --> 06:05:46.300
cooking again,

06:05:46.300 --> 06:05:48.300
because we're going to need a,

06:05:48.300 --> 06:05:50.300
if we're wanting to wrap it up in a month,

06:05:50.300 --> 06:05:53.300
I'm definitely going to need to stop getting so distracted.

06:05:53.300 --> 06:05:55.300
We'll do some cooking.

06:05:55.300 --> 06:05:57.300
Oh, the refling's out the pen.

06:05:57.300 --> 06:05:59.300
And then I'll walk again.

06:05:59.300 --> 06:06:02.300
Right, where the heck is Ernest the chicken?

06:06:02.300 --> 06:06:04.300
Uh,

06:06:09.300 --> 06:06:11.300
Starting off.

06:06:11.300 --> 06:06:12.300
Four quest points.

06:06:12.300 --> 06:06:14.300
Oh, that's the rewards.

06:06:14.300 --> 06:06:18.300
Able to survive a skeleton level 22 attacking you.

06:06:18.300 --> 06:06:21.300
Surely we're leveled up enough.

06:06:21.300 --> 06:06:23.300
Surely.

06:06:24.300 --> 06:06:27.300
Talk to Veronica outside of Draynor Manor.

06:06:27.300 --> 06:06:29.300
Blah, where is it?

06:06:29.300 --> 06:06:31.300
On the map.

06:06:32.300 --> 06:06:34.300
Draynor Manor.

06:06:34.300 --> 06:06:36.300
Draynor Village.

06:06:36.300 --> 06:06:38.300
Oh, it was like outside that creepy place.

06:06:38.300 --> 06:06:39.300
Yeah, here.

06:06:39.300 --> 06:06:40.300
Okay, okay.

06:06:40.300 --> 06:06:42.300
So how do we progress?

06:06:42.300 --> 06:06:43.300
We go across the bridge,

06:06:43.300 --> 06:06:44.300
and we go up,

06:06:44.300 --> 06:06:46.300
and then we just keep going along,

06:06:46.300 --> 06:06:48.300
and then we can go up again past the window.

06:06:48.300 --> 06:06:49.300
Okay.

06:06:49.300 --> 06:06:51.300
I shall take a breath and break.

06:06:51.300 --> 06:06:52.300
Don't get me.

06:06:52.300 --> 06:06:53.300
Oh, no.

06:06:53.300 --> 06:06:54.300
Wait.

06:06:54.300 --> 06:06:55.300
Okay.

06:06:55.300 --> 06:06:57.300
If you want to follow me,

06:06:57.300 --> 06:06:59.300
if you want to follow me refling,

06:06:59.300 --> 06:07:01.300
is there anyone who's left behind?

06:07:01.300 --> 06:07:02.300
You're not.

06:07:02.300 --> 06:07:04.300
I don't recognize you as a refling.

06:07:04.300 --> 06:07:07.300
There's a refling getting beaten up by a cow right now.

06:07:07.300 --> 06:07:09.300
But reflings come outside the pen,

06:07:09.300 --> 06:07:11.300
and you can follow me with a golden heart.

06:07:11.300 --> 06:07:13.300
I crafted the schemata and shielded myself.

06:07:13.300 --> 06:07:15.300
Heck yeah.

06:07:15.300 --> 06:07:20.300
Not all the reflings like watching this one refling be up a cow.

06:07:22.300 --> 06:07:23.300
I'm trying.

06:07:24.300 --> 06:07:26.300
Don't actually worry if I get stuck.

06:07:26.300 --> 06:07:27.300
I'll catch up.

06:07:27.300 --> 06:07:30.300
Who is this Shirley you keep talking about?

06:07:30.300 --> 06:07:32.300
It's me seeing Shirley.

06:07:34.300 --> 06:07:35.300
Okay, there.

06:07:35.300 --> 06:07:36.300
Refling.

06:07:36.300 --> 06:07:37.300
Is there any other refling?

06:07:37.300 --> 06:07:38.300
I don't know.

06:07:38.300 --> 06:07:40.300
Render distance isn't helping.

06:07:40.300 --> 06:07:42.300
I think that's just natural.

06:07:42.300 --> 06:07:43.300
Okay, let's...

06:07:43.300 --> 06:07:44.300
If you want to follow me,

06:07:44.300 --> 06:07:45.300
I have the golden heart.

06:07:45.300 --> 06:07:48.300
I'm going to be very careful with my pathing.

06:07:48.300 --> 06:07:50.300
Maybe you can follow me.

06:07:51.300 --> 06:07:53.300
Choo choo all aboard.

06:07:58.300 --> 06:07:59.300
I made it to level four.

06:07:59.300 --> 06:08:00.300
Wish me luck.

06:08:00.300 --> 06:08:01.300
We're getting there.

06:08:01.300 --> 06:08:02.300
We're getting there.

06:08:02.300 --> 06:08:05.300
We'll definitely maybe do a bit of combat training.

06:08:07.300 --> 06:08:08.300
But yeah.

06:08:09.300 --> 06:08:11.300
All aboard.

06:08:16.300 --> 06:08:18.300
I'll just kind of click one by one

06:08:18.300 --> 06:08:23.300
to make sure we don't get any actually stuck on something.

06:08:26.300 --> 06:08:28.300
How many reflings do we have in game?

06:08:29.300 --> 06:08:33.300
I don't actually know how many.

06:08:33.300 --> 06:08:35.300
We've had a few went offline

06:08:35.300 --> 06:08:37.300
because we have hit the six hour mark.

06:08:40.300 --> 06:08:44.300
But we do have a good amount of reflings all hanging out.

06:08:44.300 --> 06:08:46.300
We are going to do cooking though.

06:08:46.300 --> 06:08:47.300
I need to cook.

06:08:47.300 --> 06:08:48.300
Jesse.

06:08:49.300 --> 06:08:50.300
We need to cook.

06:08:51.300 --> 06:08:52.300
Refling.

06:08:52.300 --> 06:08:53.300
We need to cook.

06:08:53.300 --> 06:08:54.300
Okay, I'm following the bunny.

06:08:54.300 --> 06:08:56.300
Honestly, I should just follow the bunny.

06:08:58.300 --> 06:09:00.300
Right, we're just going to follow report.

06:09:00.300 --> 06:09:01.300
Follow.

06:09:02.300 --> 06:09:04.300
Wait, wasn't the bunny the one that gave me the poison?

06:09:04.300 --> 06:09:06.300
Why would I follow the bunny?

06:09:08.300 --> 06:09:10.300
Hope I can join in next time.

06:09:10.300 --> 06:09:11.300
Absolutely.

06:09:12.300 --> 06:09:13.300
Absolutely.

06:09:13.300 --> 06:09:14.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:09:14.300 --> 06:09:15.300
Oh, scary.

06:09:15.300 --> 06:09:16.300
Oh, no!

06:09:16.300 --> 06:09:17.300
It doesn't go stuck.

06:09:18.300 --> 06:09:19.300
Oh, no, refling's there.

06:09:19.300 --> 06:09:20.300
I was an AFK refling.

06:09:20.300 --> 06:09:21.300
Okay.

06:09:22.300 --> 06:09:23.300
If you want to see where we are,

06:09:23.300 --> 06:09:24.300
we're in world three AA

06:09:24.300 --> 06:09:26.300
and we're outside the creepy,

06:09:26.300 --> 06:09:28.300
creepy drain or manner.

06:09:28.300 --> 06:09:31.300
Now, apparently we can get hurt in here.

06:09:31.300 --> 06:09:33.300
So if anyone doesn't have food,

06:09:33.300 --> 06:09:34.300
do you want to trade me

06:09:34.300 --> 06:09:36.300
and I'll share my food with you?

06:09:38.300 --> 06:09:40.300
If you send a trade offer,

06:09:40.300 --> 06:09:41.300
I'll give you some food

06:09:41.300 --> 06:09:42.300
because apparently we can get hurt.

06:09:42.300 --> 06:09:43.300
But I think we can run away.

06:09:43.300 --> 06:09:45.300
We just need to run away.

06:09:46.300 --> 06:09:47.300
That's all.

06:09:48.300 --> 06:09:49.300
I crashed.

06:09:49.300 --> 06:09:50.300
Time to head back in game.

06:09:51.300 --> 06:09:53.300
The forest is pretty scary.

06:09:53.300 --> 06:09:54.300
Okay, we got a light.

06:09:55.300 --> 06:09:56.300
Follow the bunny.

06:09:56.300 --> 06:09:57.300
Last time I did that,

06:09:57.300 --> 06:09:58.300
I found myself in Wonderland.

06:10:00.300 --> 06:10:02.300
Okay, this refling needs some food.

06:10:02.300 --> 06:10:03.300
Here you go.

06:10:06.300 --> 06:10:07.300
Is there another?

06:10:07.300 --> 06:10:08.300
Or has everyone got food?

06:10:08.300 --> 06:10:09.300
Did you all cook meat?

06:10:09.300 --> 06:10:11.300
I think you all must have cooked meat, yeah.

06:10:11.300 --> 06:10:12.300
Oh, there's fires to cook meat

06:10:12.300 --> 06:10:14.300
if you picked up meat from the coals.

06:10:16.300 --> 06:10:18.300
Only now I notice that the strange

06:10:18.300 --> 06:10:20.300
horse head refling

06:10:20.300 --> 06:10:22.300
that walks strangely is no more there.

06:10:22.300 --> 06:10:24.300
We are safe for now

06:10:24.300 --> 06:10:26.300
from the strange walking refling.

06:10:26.300 --> 06:10:28.300
We've got someone giving us a gluck gluck

06:10:28.300 --> 06:10:29.300
outside the gates.

06:10:31.300 --> 06:10:33.300
Been cooking the coos, right?

06:10:33.300 --> 06:10:35.300
Okay, I don't know what happens here.

06:10:35.300 --> 06:10:37.300
But I think the forest attacked...

06:10:37.300 --> 06:10:38.300
Oh, wait, wait!

06:10:38.300 --> 06:10:39.300
Sorry, sorry.

06:10:39.300 --> 06:10:40.300
The quest is out here.

06:10:40.300 --> 06:10:41.300
Talk to the lady here.

06:10:41.300 --> 06:10:42.300
Sorry, talk to the lady.

06:10:42.300 --> 06:10:43.300
Talk to the lady at the door.

06:10:43.300 --> 06:10:44.300
Can you please help me?

06:10:44.300 --> 06:10:45.300
I'm in a terrible spot of trouble.

06:10:45.300 --> 06:10:47.300
Start, Ernest, to chicken.

06:10:47.300 --> 06:10:48.300
Absolutely.

06:10:48.300 --> 06:10:49.300
Ah, sounds like a quest.

06:10:49.300 --> 06:10:50.300
I'll help.

06:10:50.300 --> 06:10:51.300
Yes, yes.

06:10:51.300 --> 06:10:52.300
I suppose is a quest.

06:10:52.300 --> 06:10:54.300
My fiancee Ernest and I came to this hoose.

06:10:54.300 --> 06:10:56.300
Seeing that we were a little lost,

06:10:56.300 --> 06:10:59.300
Ernest decided to go in and ask for directions.

06:10:59.300 --> 06:11:00.300
That was an hour ago.

06:11:00.300 --> 06:11:01.300
This house looks spooky.

06:11:01.300 --> 06:11:03.300
Can you see if you can find it for me?

06:11:04.300 --> 06:11:05.300
I'll see what I can do.

06:11:07.300 --> 06:11:08.300
Thank you, thank you.

06:11:08.300 --> 06:11:09.300
I'm very grateful.

06:11:09.300 --> 06:11:10.300
Okay, what are we?

06:11:10.300 --> 06:11:12.300
Did we go inside now?

06:11:12.300 --> 06:11:13.300
I'm scared.

06:11:14.300 --> 06:11:17.300
All right, open the large door.

06:11:17.300 --> 06:11:18.300
Oh, wait!

06:11:18.300 --> 06:11:19.300
Requirements for the quest.

06:11:19.300 --> 06:11:21.300
You need poison and fish food.

06:11:21.300 --> 06:11:22.300
Oh, no!

06:11:22.300 --> 06:11:24.300
Where do you get poison and fish food?

06:11:26.300 --> 06:11:27.300
For the other reflins.

06:11:27.300 --> 06:11:29.300
I thought you were being funny, other reflin.

06:11:29.300 --> 06:11:30.300
I didn't realize.

06:11:30.300 --> 06:11:32.300
Oh, wait, you're giving me something?

06:11:32.300 --> 06:11:34.300
Why are you giving me?

06:11:34.300 --> 06:11:36.300
Is that a boat plug?

06:11:38.300 --> 06:11:39.300
A holy symbol.

06:11:39.300 --> 06:11:41.300
What does it do?

06:11:41.300 --> 06:11:42.300
I wear it.

06:11:43.300 --> 06:11:44.300
It's like a star.

06:11:45.300 --> 06:11:47.300
Anyone need poison or fish food?

06:11:47.300 --> 06:11:49.300
Yeah, I thought that reflim was being funny,

06:11:49.300 --> 06:11:50.300
giving me poison fish food.

06:11:50.300 --> 06:11:52.300
Turns out it's actually for the quest.

06:11:54.300 --> 06:11:56.300
That Samsung Galaxy Slurp.

06:11:57.300 --> 06:11:59.300
My life can't handle another MMO

06:11:59.300 --> 06:12:00.300
being through four in my life.

06:12:00.300 --> 06:12:01.300
So this refling...

06:12:02.300 --> 06:12:05.300
So this refling will just keep chat company.

06:12:06.300 --> 06:12:08.300
We're only doing 99.

06:12:08.300 --> 06:12:10.300
I don't know how to get poison or fish food.

06:12:10.300 --> 06:12:12.300
There might be a refling that has enough supplies.

06:12:13.300 --> 06:12:14.300
I didn't realize.

06:12:14.300 --> 06:12:15.300
I never said.

06:12:16.300 --> 06:12:17.300
I'm crazy.

06:12:17.300 --> 06:12:19.300
Recommended items, none.

06:12:19.300 --> 06:12:21.300
Or can you get them in the house?

06:12:25.300 --> 06:12:28.300
There's a spawn for them, but they're very slow.

06:12:28.300 --> 06:12:31.300
Okay, at least we can spawn the items.

06:12:32.300 --> 06:12:33.300
In the house.

06:12:34.300 --> 06:12:36.300
Right, I'm gonna very quickly go for a pee.

06:12:36.300 --> 06:12:38.300
I don't know why I need to pee so much.

06:12:38.300 --> 06:12:39.300
I think I'll make a tea as well.

06:12:39.300 --> 06:12:41.300
Sorry, my voice is like really struggling.

06:12:44.300 --> 06:12:47.300
I really want to stream for long.

06:12:51.300 --> 06:12:54.300
I'm worried about how long I can last during my ASMR stream.

06:12:55.300 --> 06:12:57.300
A little tinkle break, yeah.

06:12:58.300 --> 06:12:59.300
A little tinkle-winkle.

06:12:59.300 --> 06:13:01.300
The poison's in the house near the kitchen.

06:13:01.300 --> 06:13:03.300
Okay, so at least we know the fish food

06:13:03.300 --> 06:13:04.300
and the thing he does respawn.

06:13:04.300 --> 06:13:05.300
I'm gonna make another tea.

06:13:05.300 --> 06:13:07.300
I'm so sorry about all the breaks today.

06:13:07.300 --> 06:13:08.300
It's my voice.

06:13:09.300 --> 06:13:11.300
I'm getting, I'm getting nervous.

06:13:11.300 --> 06:13:12.300
I'm not gonna be able to make it.

06:13:12.300 --> 06:13:14.300
But for the ASMR and the sweet trying stream,

06:13:14.300 --> 06:13:16.300
like, oh, sorry, I just stood on the mic.

06:13:16.300 --> 06:13:17.300
Sorry about that.

06:13:17.300 --> 06:13:19.300
I just absolutely obliterate your ears there.

06:13:19.300 --> 06:13:20.300
Don't apologize.

06:13:20.300 --> 06:13:21.300
I'll be back.

06:13:21.300 --> 06:13:23.300
I'll literally be in a minute, okay?

06:13:23.300 --> 06:13:24.300
To pee.

06:14:11.300 --> 06:14:12.300
Yeah.

06:14:41.300 --> 06:14:42.300
Yeah.

06:15:11.300 --> 06:15:12.300
Yeah.

06:15:41.300 --> 06:15:42.300
Yeah.

06:16:11.300 --> 06:16:12.300
Yeah.

06:16:41.300 --> 06:16:42.300
Yeah.

06:17:11.300 --> 06:17:12.300
Yeah.

06:17:41.300 --> 06:17:43.300
Yeah.

06:18:11.300 --> 06:18:18.300
I don't know if it's a jumpscare when the tracking doesn't catch me coming into the room.

06:18:18.300 --> 06:18:21.300
And I just unmute and I'm like, oh.

06:18:21.300 --> 06:18:22.300
Oh.

06:18:22.300 --> 06:18:23.300
Oh.

06:18:23.300 --> 06:18:24.300
Oh.

06:18:24.300 --> 06:18:25.300
Oh.

06:18:25.300 --> 06:18:26.300
Oh.

06:18:26.300 --> 06:18:27.300
Oh.

06:18:27.300 --> 06:18:28.300
Oh.

06:18:28.300 --> 06:18:29.300
Oh.

06:18:29.300 --> 06:18:30.300
Oh.

06:18:30.300 --> 06:18:31.300
Oh.

06:18:31.300 --> 06:18:32.300
Oh.

06:18:32.300 --> 06:18:33.300
Oh.

06:18:33.300 --> 06:18:34.300
Oh.

06:18:34.300 --> 06:18:35.300
Oh.

06:18:35.300 --> 06:18:36.300
Oh.

06:18:36.300 --> 06:18:37.300
Oh.

06:18:37.300 --> 06:18:38.300
Oh.

06:18:38.300 --> 06:18:39.300
Oh.

06:18:39.300 --> 06:18:40.300
Oh.

06:18:40.300 --> 06:18:41.300
Oh.

06:18:41.300 --> 06:18:42.300
Oh.

06:18:42.300 --> 06:18:43.300
Oh.

06:18:43.300 --> 06:18:44.300
Oh.

06:18:44.300 --> 06:18:45.300
Oh.

06:18:45.300 --> 06:18:46.300
Oh.

06:18:46.300 --> 06:18:47.300
You died.

06:18:47.300 --> 06:18:50.300
Woman in the scar.

06:18:50.300 --> 06:18:58.300
Why is it so loud in the music menu?

06:18:58.300 --> 06:19:02.300
Thank goodness it doesn't link the details on the audio.

06:19:02.300 --> 06:19:03.300
I think we're in skating with it.

06:19:03.300 --> 06:19:06.300
Some people stream, what do you need?

06:19:06.300 --> 06:19:08.300
Right.

06:19:08.300 --> 06:19:10.300
an air nest.

06:19:10.300 --> 06:19:12.300
Chang.

06:19:12.300 --> 06:19:15.300
One refling went to go grab some spades for people who don't have one.

06:19:15.300 --> 06:19:17.300
Oh sugar, I don't have a spade either.

06:19:17.300 --> 06:19:19.300
Oh wait, what am I doing?

06:19:19.300 --> 06:19:20.300
No, this one.

06:19:20.300 --> 06:19:22.300
And then this one.

06:19:24.300 --> 06:19:26.300
Uh, okay.

06:19:26.300 --> 06:19:28.300
Are we waiting for spades?

06:19:30.300 --> 06:19:32.300
Trade for spade!

06:19:32.300 --> 06:19:34.300
Trade me! Trade mommy! Trade mommy!

06:19:34.300 --> 06:19:36.300
Mommy needs a spade!

06:19:36.300 --> 06:19:38.300
Just one, please.

06:19:44.300 --> 06:19:46.300
I did make another spade.

06:19:46.300 --> 06:19:48.300
I'm happy to say my pee was clear.

06:19:48.300 --> 06:19:52.300
Um, I don't think I can do endurance.

06:19:52.300 --> 06:19:54.300
My...

06:19:54.300 --> 06:19:56.300
My throat is very sore right now.

06:19:56.300 --> 06:20:00.300
It's very raw and it hurts, okay?

06:20:00.300 --> 06:20:02.300
I'm needing your ink to help me

06:20:02.300 --> 06:20:04.300
unironically soothe my throat.

06:20:04.300 --> 06:20:06.300
So I think what the deal is

06:20:06.300 --> 06:20:09.300
when Mercy goes live,

06:20:09.300 --> 06:20:13.300
which is in T-minus

06:20:13.300 --> 06:20:18.300
two and a half hours for snippets,

06:20:18.300 --> 06:20:20.300
we'll raid into her.

06:20:20.300 --> 06:20:22.300
If that's okay.

06:20:22.300 --> 06:20:24.300
Um, there's a spade inside as well.

06:20:24.300 --> 06:20:25.300
Just woke up. How's runes keep going?

06:20:25.300 --> 06:20:27.300
It's going good!

06:20:27.300 --> 06:20:29.300
Um, sadly my voice can't keep up.

06:20:29.300 --> 06:20:31.300
This is when I get really frustrated for streaming.

06:20:31.300 --> 06:20:33.300
I could happily stream 12 hours right now.

06:20:34.300 --> 06:20:36.300
But it really hurts.

06:20:36.300 --> 06:20:39.300
Okay, dropping some poison and fish food.

06:20:39.300 --> 06:20:41.300
Okay, we'll wait until it loads up.

06:20:44.300 --> 06:20:46.300
Honey, ink, tea, honestly.

06:20:46.300 --> 06:20:48.300
Mercy's in two hours, yeah.

06:20:48.300 --> 06:20:50.300
Oh good, been having tons of fun

06:20:50.300 --> 06:20:53.300
and it's already a long stream, don't feel bad, yeah.

06:20:53.300 --> 06:20:55.300
What do you mean? This is a baby stream for me?

06:20:55.300 --> 06:20:56.300
Are you joking me?

06:20:56.300 --> 06:20:58.300
Literally a two hour stream,

06:20:58.300 --> 06:21:00.300
which is like the average for a VTuber,

06:21:00.300 --> 06:21:02.300
is like a millisecond in my time.

06:21:03.300 --> 06:21:05.300
Like, oh, I feel so bad.

06:21:05.300 --> 06:21:07.300
I'm only going to stream eight hours today.

06:21:07.300 --> 06:21:08.300
Ah!

06:21:08.300 --> 06:21:11.300
I mean, what do you mean I got to play a multiplayer game

06:21:11.300 --> 06:21:13.300
with quite literally, like,

06:21:13.300 --> 06:21:17.300
how freaking blessed is it to be able to play a multiplayer game

06:21:17.300 --> 06:21:19.300
with Reeflings live

06:21:19.300 --> 06:21:21.300
whilst we're having a carry-on,

06:21:21.300 --> 06:21:23.300
just meme-ing about freaking doing head-banging,

06:21:23.300 --> 06:21:25.300
like, I've been dripped out,

06:21:25.300 --> 06:21:27.300
I've been getting gifts and stuff,

06:21:27.300 --> 06:21:29.300
people giving money, like,

06:21:29.300 --> 06:21:31.300
it's not a job!

06:21:31.300 --> 06:21:33.300
Like, this is fun!

06:21:33.300 --> 06:21:35.300
Like, I'm having so much fun!

06:21:36.300 --> 06:21:38.300
Ugh, I wish there was some sort of secret

06:21:38.300 --> 06:21:41.300
to, like, fixing, like, my voice from vocal strain,

06:21:41.300 --> 06:21:43.300
but the sad secret is it's literally just

06:21:43.300 --> 06:21:45.300
shut up, stop talking.

06:21:45.300 --> 06:21:47.300
Ugh, which is so annoying.

06:21:49.300 --> 06:21:51.300
Better to end early than strain your throat.

06:21:51.300 --> 06:21:53.300
I mean, it's already strained right now, but, uh...

06:21:54.300 --> 06:21:56.300
What do you mean, multiplayer-to-ever talk,

06:21:56.300 --> 06:21:58.300
yapping sessions, honestly,

06:21:58.300 --> 06:22:00.300
is just yap, yap, yap.

06:22:00.300 --> 06:22:02.300
We got a little spooky boy!

06:22:02.300 --> 06:22:04.300
Spooky, spooky, bump again!

06:22:05.300 --> 06:22:07.300
You're so misunderstood.

06:22:07.300 --> 06:22:09.300
Oh, did you like Emmy's cover?

06:22:09.300 --> 06:22:10.300
No.

06:22:10.300 --> 06:22:11.300
Mo!

06:22:11.300 --> 06:22:13.300
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

06:22:13.300 --> 06:22:14.300
Oh, it's in a mo!

06:22:14.300 --> 06:22:15.300
Oh, you're yawning just head off!

06:22:15.300 --> 06:22:16.300
Oh, that's hilarious.

06:22:16.300 --> 06:22:18.300
I'm waiting for the fish food to load,

06:22:18.300 --> 06:22:20.300
so the others can grab it,

06:22:20.300 --> 06:22:22.300
but I actually don't see it loading.

06:22:23.300 --> 06:22:25.300
Having so much fun just hanging out at the Reeflings,

06:22:25.300 --> 06:22:27.300
have all of the quests done already?

06:22:27.300 --> 06:22:29.300
No, the quests are not done, please don't worry,

06:22:29.300 --> 06:22:31.300
we're doing the free quest,

06:22:31.300 --> 06:22:33.300
Erin is the chicken at the moment.

06:22:33.300 --> 06:22:34.300
We've done a hand...

06:22:34.300 --> 06:22:36.300
Oh, I've got my BS forehead in the way,

06:22:36.300 --> 06:22:38.300
hold on, let me just close this for a second.

06:22:38.300 --> 06:22:40.300
Here is all the quests we've done,

06:22:40.300 --> 06:22:42.300
so free quests, we've done Cook's Assistant,

06:22:42.300 --> 06:22:44.300
we're doing Big Erin Ease,

06:22:44.300 --> 06:22:46.300
the chicken right now.

06:22:46.300 --> 06:22:48.300
We did the mystery,

06:22:48.300 --> 06:22:50.300
the restless ghost Romeo and Juliet,

06:22:50.300 --> 06:22:53.300
Sheepshearer, X marks the spot,

06:22:53.300 --> 06:22:55.300
we're finishing Erin is the chicken,

06:22:55.300 --> 06:22:57.300
and then we're going back to update,

06:22:57.300 --> 06:22:59.300
to grind on our cooking stats.

06:23:00.300 --> 06:23:03.300
Can't expect you to do constant endurance streams day after day,

06:23:03.300 --> 06:23:05.300
sadly I hate it,

06:23:05.300 --> 06:23:07.300
I don't like doing short streams,

06:23:07.300 --> 06:23:09.300
I just feel so like...

06:23:09.300 --> 06:23:11.300
I don't know what the word is,

06:23:11.300 --> 06:23:16.300
I have been yearning for this day,

06:23:16.300 --> 06:23:18.300
for an entire year,

06:23:18.300 --> 06:23:21.300
for this time, sorry, not for this day in particular,

06:23:21.300 --> 06:23:23.300
but for this time,

06:23:23.300 --> 06:23:26.300
and it's just like...

06:23:26.300 --> 06:23:30.300
It's frustrating that the only reason I can't stream more

06:23:30.300 --> 06:23:31.300
is because of my voice,

06:23:31.300 --> 06:23:33.300
and not because I'm tired,

06:23:33.300 --> 06:23:34.300
or I don't feel well,

06:23:34.300 --> 06:23:35.300
or I don't want to type thing,

06:23:35.300 --> 06:23:36.300
it's frustrating,

06:23:36.300 --> 06:23:38.300
it's my voice.

06:23:38.300 --> 06:23:39.300
That's it.

06:23:39.300 --> 06:23:42.300
That's the only reason I can't stream for long,

06:23:42.300 --> 06:23:45.300
because it hurts to talk right now.

06:23:47.300 --> 06:23:49.300
Jesus, you haven't seen the whole song!

06:23:51.300 --> 06:23:53.300
Try to live up to the name, you know?

06:23:54.300 --> 06:23:55.300
Maybe.

06:23:55.300 --> 06:23:57.300
I asked for a little bit off the top.

06:23:57.300 --> 06:23:59.300
Hey, yo, who's the barber?

06:24:00.300 --> 06:24:01.300
Man, we gotta go both.

06:24:01.300 --> 06:24:03.300
Okay, the poison isn't loading on the floor for me,

06:24:03.300 --> 06:24:05.300
but I think we'll do it,

06:24:05.300 --> 06:24:07.300
so as long as you guys have accepted the quest,

06:24:07.300 --> 06:24:10.300
we're gonna go inside now, reflings.

06:24:10.300 --> 06:24:12.300
It's taking nice and slow.

06:24:12.300 --> 06:24:14.300
I think the trees hit you on the way past,

06:24:14.300 --> 06:24:17.300
so just be careful you don't stray from the path too much.

06:24:17.300 --> 06:24:19.300
Assumers supposed to go...

06:24:19.300 --> 06:24:21.300
Ah, the tree frickin' went for me.

06:24:21.300 --> 06:24:23.300
Open large door.

06:24:23.300 --> 06:24:25.300
Okay.

06:24:27.300 --> 06:24:29.300
Oh, there's like haunted things.

06:24:29.300 --> 06:24:31.300
Where are we supposed to go?

06:24:31.300 --> 06:24:33.300
Get the gauge and tube.

06:24:33.300 --> 06:24:35.300
Where is that?

06:24:37.300 --> 06:24:39.300
And not here, maybe it's upstairs?

06:24:42.300 --> 06:24:44.300
Okay, we...

06:24:44.300 --> 06:24:46.300
I'm gonna wait until...

06:24:47.300 --> 06:24:49.300
Oh, that's not good.

06:24:49.300 --> 06:24:52.300
Wait, I'm just gonna check how the reflings made it in.

06:24:52.300 --> 06:24:55.300
Go up the stairs, reflings, when you come inside.

06:24:56.300 --> 06:24:58.300
Is that the last refling?

06:25:03.300 --> 06:25:05.300
Who's that?

06:25:05.300 --> 06:25:07.300
I think that's the last refling.

06:25:07.300 --> 06:25:09.300
We all need to go upstairs.

06:25:10.300 --> 06:25:12.300
How are you even there?

06:25:12.300 --> 06:25:13.300
The chair's attacking him!

06:25:13.300 --> 06:25:15.300
Oh my god, that chair being yours!

06:25:20.300 --> 06:25:21.300
Okay, that...

06:25:21.300 --> 06:25:22.300
Is there no refling there?

06:25:22.300 --> 06:25:24.300
Oh, I'll go up the stairs.

06:25:26.300 --> 06:25:27.300
Oh, he like...

06:25:27.300 --> 06:25:28.300
Oh, someone's beating them up.

06:25:28.300 --> 06:25:29.300
Wait, where are we supposed to go?

06:25:29.300 --> 06:25:30.300
Up here?

06:25:30.300 --> 06:25:32.300
Up these stairs to the left?

06:25:32.300 --> 06:25:34.300
As soon as we come up?

06:25:36.300 --> 06:25:38.300
Nothing's being highlighted for me.

06:25:38.300 --> 06:25:40.300
Runlight, you're failing me!

06:25:40.300 --> 06:25:41.300
Am I supposed to go here?

06:25:41.300 --> 06:25:43.300
Talk to the professor?

06:25:46.300 --> 06:25:48.300
Be careful, there's lots of things...

06:25:48.300 --> 06:25:49.300
Brian!

06:25:49.300 --> 06:25:52.300
It frustrates you because you can't control it

06:25:52.300 --> 06:25:54.300
and that's the most frustrating thing.

06:25:54.300 --> 06:25:56.300
Not being able to control something.

06:25:56.300 --> 06:25:57.300
That's right.

06:25:57.300 --> 06:25:58.300
Thank you, Iron Looper.

06:25:58.300 --> 06:25:59.300
For the tip.

06:25:59.300 --> 06:26:01.300
And yeah, just like...

06:26:01.300 --> 06:26:03.300
Runlight is telling you to use...

06:26:06.300 --> 06:26:07.300
Wait, hold on.

06:26:07.300 --> 06:26:09.300
Oh no, I'm messing up.

06:26:09.300 --> 06:26:11.300
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:26:14.300 --> 06:26:15.300
That's not so easy.

06:26:15.300 --> 06:26:16.300
Well, look at them.

06:26:17.300 --> 06:26:19.300
Oh, maybe I should be reading that out.

06:26:19.300 --> 06:26:20.300
What would that say?

06:26:20.300 --> 06:26:23.300
Runlight is telling you to use your poison on your fish food.

06:26:23.300 --> 06:26:24.300
Okay.

06:26:24.300 --> 06:26:26.300
Okay, I have poison fish food.

06:26:26.300 --> 06:26:28.300
Wait, never mind.

06:26:29.300 --> 06:26:30.300
Just hypnotize yourself.

06:26:30.300 --> 06:26:32.300
Strongly trust me, I love you and enjoy every second,

06:26:32.300 --> 06:26:34.300
but your health is important.

06:26:34.300 --> 06:26:36.300
Yeah, like, as long as my voice doesn't break,

06:26:36.300 --> 06:26:37.300
then I'm good to go.

06:26:37.300 --> 06:26:39.300
In my pain.

06:26:39.300 --> 06:26:40.300
Where...

06:26:40.300 --> 06:26:43.300
Where is this freaking map telling me to go?

06:26:43.300 --> 06:26:44.300
I'm so confused.

06:26:44.300 --> 06:26:45.300
I wanna go.

06:26:47.300 --> 06:26:49.300
We were to go outside?

06:26:49.300 --> 06:26:51.300
Oh, right, okay.

06:26:52.300 --> 06:26:53.300
Oh, no, sorry.

06:26:53.300 --> 06:26:55.300
Close the map, not close.

06:26:56.300 --> 06:26:58.300
Right, so go downstairs.

06:27:01.300 --> 06:27:03.300
Okay, come downstairs.

06:27:04.300 --> 06:27:07.300
Poison the fish food and then come back out of the mansion.

06:27:09.300 --> 06:27:10.300
Okay.

06:27:10.300 --> 06:27:12.300
Oh, this is a rough one to do together, I think,

06:27:12.300 --> 06:27:14.300
so if you've not got...

06:27:14.300 --> 06:27:16.300
The door won't open.

06:27:16.300 --> 06:27:18.300
Over here.

06:27:18.300 --> 06:27:19.300
Okay, okay, okay.

06:27:19.300 --> 06:27:21.300
How do I get over there?

06:27:22.300 --> 06:27:24.300
Wait, open the door.

06:27:24.300 --> 06:27:25.300
The chair beating you up?

06:27:25.300 --> 06:27:26.300
Oh, no, they just run around.

06:27:26.300 --> 06:27:27.300
I thought the chair was like,

06:27:27.300 --> 06:27:29.300
beat you up in the game on my cheek.

06:27:33.300 --> 06:27:35.300
Oh, there's a rubber tube.

06:27:35.300 --> 06:27:36.300
I get it.

06:27:36.300 --> 06:27:38.300
Get the gauge in the tube.

06:27:38.300 --> 06:27:39.300
Oh, my God.

06:27:39.300 --> 06:27:41.300
Open the door.

06:27:41.300 --> 06:27:43.300
What's that?

06:27:44.300 --> 06:27:46.300
Oh, I'm actually kind of scared of that.

06:27:47.300 --> 06:27:48.300
Wait, I can't go in.

06:27:48.300 --> 06:27:49.300
The door's locked.

06:27:49.300 --> 06:27:50.300
Oh, right, okay.

06:27:52.300 --> 06:27:55.300
Someone's dropped a speed ahead if you need it, by the way.

06:27:57.300 --> 06:27:59.300
But we're taking the long way around.

06:28:02.300 --> 06:28:03.300
Okay, I'm glad the chairs don't beat you up

06:28:03.300 --> 06:28:06.300
because, honestly, death by chair is pretty embarrassing.

06:28:06.300 --> 06:28:08.300
Right, open the door.

06:28:08.300 --> 06:28:11.300
Or I'm gonna throw rocks through your window.

06:28:12.300 --> 06:28:14.300
Open the door.

06:28:14.300 --> 06:28:17.300
Okay, so one by one door, but we can add it.

06:28:17.300 --> 06:28:19.300
I need to get the key first.

06:28:19.300 --> 06:28:20.300
Well, she's a stubborn one,

06:28:20.300 --> 06:28:21.300
but I guess she keeps up till the day

06:28:21.300 --> 06:28:22.300
she can take care of herself

06:28:22.300 --> 06:28:24.300
to some fish so hard, man.

06:28:26.300 --> 06:28:28.300
Okay, okay, we're now outside.

06:28:28.300 --> 06:28:30.300
This is a very hard one to follow,

06:28:30.300 --> 06:28:32.300
quest-wise.

06:28:32.300 --> 06:28:34.300
Especially if you had a rune-like,

06:28:34.300 --> 06:28:36.300
rune-crafting guild.

06:28:36.300 --> 06:28:37.300
Stop.

06:28:37.300 --> 06:28:40.300
Are you telling someone that we're rune-crafting guilds?

06:28:41.300 --> 06:28:44.300
Okay, I'm just following the Easter bunny.

06:28:44.300 --> 06:28:47.300
Follow the bunny, the bunny, the bunny.

06:28:47.300 --> 06:28:49.300
Follow the Easter bunny.

06:28:49.300 --> 06:28:51.300
To east, to east, to east.

06:28:51.300 --> 06:28:53.300
Search compost heap.

06:28:53.300 --> 06:28:54.300
Heap.

06:28:54.300 --> 06:28:55.300
I love it.

06:28:55.300 --> 06:28:57.300
A bit of cheeky vandalism.

06:28:57.300 --> 06:28:58.300
Okay, we did it.

06:28:58.300 --> 06:29:00.300
Oh, what did I do?

06:29:00.300 --> 06:29:02.300
You find a small key.

06:29:02.300 --> 06:29:04.300
Okay.

06:29:04.300 --> 06:29:06.300
And now...

06:29:07.300 --> 06:29:09.300
Okay.

06:29:09.300 --> 06:29:11.300
Oh, there's a thing ahead.

06:29:11.300 --> 06:29:13.300
Okay, there's a fountain ahead.

06:29:13.300 --> 06:29:14.300
I don't know.

06:29:14.300 --> 06:29:15.300
Has that already come to you?

06:29:15.300 --> 06:29:16.300
I feel like...

06:29:16.300 --> 06:29:18.300
I feel like someone's probably stuck in the house right now.

06:29:18.300 --> 06:29:21.300
As long as you try and come outside, then you'll be fine.

06:29:21.300 --> 06:29:23.300
So as long as you've all got the key,

06:29:23.300 --> 06:29:25.300
come to the fountain next.

06:29:25.300 --> 06:29:26.300
There's a fountain through the trees.

06:29:26.300 --> 06:29:27.300
The trees might whip you,

06:29:27.300 --> 06:29:29.300
but you should survive.

06:29:29.300 --> 06:29:31.300
Like, it's literally one HP at least.

06:29:31.300 --> 06:29:34.300
Poisoned fish food on the fountain.

06:29:34.300 --> 06:29:36.300
Use on the fountain.

06:29:36.300 --> 06:29:38.300
Oh, the tree just made a noise.

06:29:39.300 --> 06:29:42.300
Use it on the fountain.

06:29:42.300 --> 06:29:44.300
Okay.

06:29:44.300 --> 06:29:46.300
The piranhas start eating the food,

06:29:46.300 --> 06:29:49.300
then dine float to the surface.

06:29:49.300 --> 06:29:51.300
And then search the fountain.

06:29:51.300 --> 06:29:53.300
There seems to be a pressure gauge in here,

06:29:53.300 --> 06:29:55.300
and a lot of dead fish.

06:29:55.300 --> 06:29:57.300
Well, yeah, you just roll them,

06:29:57.300 --> 06:29:59.300
smoke them.

06:30:01.300 --> 06:30:02.300
Come outside.

06:30:02.300 --> 06:30:05.300
Yes, I see, I see.

06:30:05.300 --> 06:30:07.300
Okay, once we've all stopped

06:30:07.300 --> 06:30:10.300
head banging into the fountain,

06:30:10.300 --> 06:30:13.300
then we go back into the house.

06:30:13.300 --> 06:30:16.300
Anyone got some spare poison fish?

06:30:18.300 --> 06:30:21.300
Ah, the poison was in the house, I think.

06:30:21.300 --> 06:30:23.300
Wait, we're outside the house.

06:30:23.300 --> 06:30:24.300
How do we get back in?

06:30:24.300 --> 06:30:27.300
Why is it making me go around in a circle?

06:30:27.300 --> 06:30:30.300
I'm spinning around.

06:30:30.300 --> 06:30:32.300
Get out of my way.

06:30:33.300 --> 06:30:36.300
I didn't think for how much time

06:30:36.300 --> 06:30:38.300
you prepared for this, by the way.

06:30:38.300 --> 06:30:40.300
How is it, is it like you expected?

06:30:40.300 --> 06:30:42.300
To me, you're having a lot of fun,

06:30:42.300 --> 06:30:44.300
but maybe you have more to see.

06:30:44.300 --> 06:30:45.300
On RuneScape?

06:30:45.300 --> 06:30:46.300
I'm getting whipped by a tree.

06:30:46.300 --> 06:30:48.300
Sorry, sorry, Ruflin's getting whipped by a tree

06:30:48.300 --> 06:30:50.300
because of me, sorry.

06:30:50.300 --> 06:30:52.300
I didn't mean RuneScape, it took a little second

06:30:52.300 --> 06:30:54.300
to get ready to stream out.

06:30:54.300 --> 06:30:56.300
I wasn't that bad.

06:30:56.300 --> 06:30:58.300
Scale it in time, you just have to run in

06:30:58.300 --> 06:31:00.300
and pick the tube, then run out.

06:31:00.300 --> 06:31:02.300
Make it in turns, who wants to go first?

06:31:04.300 --> 06:31:06.300
Ah, fuck it, I'll go first.

06:31:06.300 --> 06:31:08.300
I need a lead by example.

06:31:08.300 --> 06:31:10.300
Okay, grab the tube and then...

06:31:10.300 --> 06:31:12.300
Okay, I got whacked for two,

06:31:12.300 --> 06:31:14.300
so just make sure you get out in time.

06:31:16.300 --> 06:31:18.300
Would you prefer to be whipped by a tree?

06:31:18.300 --> 06:31:20.300
Is it instance,

06:31:20.300 --> 06:31:22.300
or are we going to have to wait for that to reload?

06:31:22.300 --> 06:31:24.300
Oh no, you've got it, you've got it.

06:31:24.300 --> 06:31:25.300
Okay, that's fine.

06:31:25.300 --> 06:31:26.300
Are you beating him up?

06:31:26.300 --> 06:31:28.300
He said nah, hold on, let me do this,

06:31:28.300 --> 06:31:30.300
Ruflin's like all this.

06:31:30.300 --> 06:31:32.300
He's going to skillspec him, he's going to skillspec

06:31:32.300 --> 06:31:34.300
he's going to do the little twirl thing.

06:31:34.300 --> 06:31:36.300
Oh, streaming in general has been absolutely fantastic.

06:31:36.300 --> 06:31:38.300
It's gone exactly the way I wanted it to.

06:31:40.300 --> 06:31:42.300
I love streams, Nathan,

06:31:42.300 --> 06:31:44.300
and I love long streams and yapping people's heads off

06:31:44.300 --> 06:31:46.300
and it's just gone absolutely amazing.

06:31:50.300 --> 06:31:52.300
Just fantastic.

06:31:52.300 --> 06:31:54.300
For me, I don't like the mega

06:31:54.300 --> 06:31:56.300
super professional streams, don't mind me.

06:31:56.300 --> 06:31:58.300
Some people really like it.

06:31:58.300 --> 06:32:00.300
Let's go, has everyone got it?

06:32:02.300 --> 06:32:04.300
Thank you, Ruflin, for killing the skelly boy.

06:32:04.300 --> 06:32:06.300
Has everyone got the rubber tube?

06:32:08.300 --> 06:32:10.300
I don't think everyone's got it.

06:32:10.300 --> 06:32:12.300
I don't know if it's been a bit funny,

06:32:12.300 --> 06:32:14.300
but you should be able to go in and get the rubber tube

06:32:14.300 --> 06:32:16.300
now that you've got the key.

06:32:18.300 --> 06:32:20.300
Oh, someone's getting attacked over there.

06:32:20.300 --> 06:32:22.300
Is there a Rufling? Oh, I thought a Ruflin just perished there.

06:32:22.300 --> 06:32:24.300
Ruflin just perished there.

06:32:24.300 --> 06:32:26.300
I'm happy to hear that, yeah.

06:32:28.300 --> 06:32:30.300
There is nothing like a professional stream.

06:32:30.300 --> 06:32:32.300
Where's the fish food?

06:32:40.300 --> 06:32:42.300
Upstairs is the fish food reefling,

06:32:42.300 --> 06:32:44.300
someone says.

06:32:46.300 --> 06:32:48.300
I'll wait here until the other reeflings are caught

06:32:48.300 --> 06:32:50.300
because it's not fair to skip ahead.

06:32:50.300 --> 06:32:52.300
I like when funny Scott women yank to me for hours.

06:32:52.300 --> 06:32:54.300
Simple as, nothing more.

06:32:54.300 --> 06:32:56.300
Now, people really enjoy professional streams

06:32:56.300 --> 06:32:58.300
from other people, which is great,

06:32:58.300 --> 06:33:00.300
but for me, I'm just like...

06:33:04.300 --> 06:33:06.300
It's the best I can say.

06:33:08.300 --> 06:33:10.300
Oh, we're getting two head bang.

06:33:10.300 --> 06:33:12.300
Yo, I'm starting to think this is getting...

06:33:12.300 --> 06:33:14.300
Hold on, oh no, I can't wait, wait, let me zoom up a bit.

06:33:14.300 --> 06:33:16.300
Let me take one more step

06:33:16.300 --> 06:33:18.300
for no particular reason at all.

06:33:18.300 --> 06:33:20.300
Okay, let me take one more step

06:33:20.300 --> 06:33:22.300
for no particular reason at all.

06:33:22.300 --> 06:33:24.300
Because it's absolutely no reason at all.

06:33:30.300 --> 06:33:32.300
We are literal children, this is terrible.

06:33:32.300 --> 06:33:34.300
That awful getting...

06:33:34.300 --> 06:33:36.300
Hey, hey, hey, hey, he dancing on it,

06:33:36.300 --> 06:33:38.300
he dancing on it, he doing the split on it.

06:33:42.300 --> 06:33:44.300
I love your silly yapping.

06:33:44.300 --> 06:33:46.300
Oh my God, a ghost is going for it.

06:33:52.300 --> 06:33:54.300
Is there a refling on the outskirts?

06:33:54.300 --> 06:33:56.300
Oh, I think I'm too far away to be able to see

06:33:56.300 --> 06:33:58.300
if someone's at the compost heap right now.

06:33:58.300 --> 06:34:00.300
Oh no, someone's getting beaten up.

06:34:00.300 --> 06:34:02.300
Oh no, it's not him though.

06:34:02.300 --> 06:34:04.300
I have salmon if you want it,

06:34:04.300 --> 06:34:06.300
a refling that's literally protecting us all.

06:34:08.300 --> 06:34:10.300
There's salmon juice, whoa, what is that?

06:34:10.300 --> 06:34:12.300
Oh, is that for me?

06:34:12.300 --> 06:34:14.300
Wait, should I do this in the middle?

06:34:14.300 --> 06:34:16.300
I don't know what he does.

06:34:16.300 --> 06:34:18.300
Scottlefish, are you there?

06:34:18.300 --> 06:34:20.300
Should I do it or no?

06:34:20.300 --> 06:34:22.300
I don't know if the old man's got a good quest or not.

06:34:24.300 --> 06:34:26.300
Did I talk to him?

06:34:28.300 --> 06:34:30.300
Do it, okay, someone says do it.

06:34:30.300 --> 06:34:32.300
Oh, there you are, I hoped you would talk to me.

06:34:32.300 --> 06:34:34.300
I get so lonely, I have a present, I must get going now.

06:34:34.300 --> 06:34:36.300
Oh!

06:34:36.300 --> 06:34:38.300
Oh, he just gave me an uncut emerald.

06:34:38.300 --> 06:34:40.300
I didn't even ask anything.

06:34:40.300 --> 06:34:42.300
I didn't even ask anything.

06:34:42.300 --> 06:34:44.300
Oh, don't mind if I do,

06:34:44.300 --> 06:34:46.300
I thought he was going to like whisk me away.

06:34:46.300 --> 06:34:48.300
But he didn't.

06:34:50.300 --> 06:34:52.300
Oh, I see the poison.

06:34:52.300 --> 06:34:54.300
Whoa, poison's like 700.

06:34:56.300 --> 06:34:58.300
Well, I know where the poison is,

06:34:58.300 --> 06:35:00.300
if I don't need to know, it's by the left.

06:35:00.300 --> 06:35:02.300
As you come in.

06:35:04.300 --> 06:35:06.300
Does he need help?

06:35:10.300 --> 06:35:12.300
Wow.

06:35:14.300 --> 06:35:16.300
You wish to trade with me, what do you wish to trade?

06:35:16.300 --> 06:35:18.300
Oh, you're giving it,

06:35:18.300 --> 06:35:20.300
oh, the diamonds,

06:35:22.300 --> 06:35:24.300
how you call them.

06:35:24.300 --> 06:35:26.300
I don't know, the rocks in the ground.

06:35:26.300 --> 06:35:28.300
What are these called? It's not jewelry.

06:35:28.300 --> 06:35:30.300
But they're rocks.

06:35:32.300 --> 06:35:34.300
What are diamonds category?

06:35:34.300 --> 06:35:36.300
What are the category of ruby and plafa and that?

06:35:36.300 --> 06:35:38.300
Gemstones!

06:35:38.300 --> 06:35:40.300
Oh my god, I forgot that word there.

06:35:40.300 --> 06:35:42.300
Jeez, low waist.

06:35:42.300 --> 06:35:44.300
I literally forgot the word gems there.

06:35:44.300 --> 06:35:46.300
I apologize.

06:35:46.300 --> 06:35:48.300
Watch ads showed up tipped and left.

06:35:48.300 --> 06:35:50.300
Or, yeah, or in gems.

06:35:50.300 --> 06:35:52.300
I got out.

06:35:52.300 --> 06:35:54.300
Oh god, we're all headbanging.

06:35:54.300 --> 06:35:56.300
Are you practicing later?

06:35:56.300 --> 06:35:58.300
For when the next 10 audios come out?

06:35:58.300 --> 06:36:00.300
Wait, where is it? Headbanging?

06:36:00.300 --> 06:36:02.300
Headbanging.

06:36:02.300 --> 06:36:04.300
Oh my god, we really are a call.

06:36:04.300 --> 06:36:06.300
Clearly, look at us go.

06:36:12.300 --> 06:36:14.300
Oh, do you need, you need help,

06:36:14.300 --> 06:36:16.300
holy crap you need help right now.

06:36:16.300 --> 06:36:18.300
I've got salmon.

06:36:18.300 --> 06:36:20.300
This should heal you up.

06:36:22.300 --> 06:36:24.300
Go, go, go.

06:36:24.300 --> 06:36:26.300
Is there any reeflings?

06:36:26.300 --> 06:36:28.300
Oh no, they're self healing.

06:36:28.300 --> 06:36:30.300
Is there any reeflings on the outskirts?

06:36:30.300 --> 06:36:38.300
I can't really tell. I don't want to go ahead in case there's someone outside doing that. Fountain, but, um...

06:36:40.300 --> 06:36:42.300
Is everyone here? Did we make it?

06:36:42.300 --> 06:36:44.300
If there's a roofling, oh.

06:36:44.300 --> 06:36:46.300
Who did that? Who did that?

06:36:46.300 --> 06:36:48.300
That was you?

06:36:48.300 --> 06:36:52.300
Okay, we're reporting you for harassment.

06:36:52.300 --> 06:36:56.300
Interesting, we're in sync for me, but on stream.

06:36:56.300 --> 06:36:59.300
My ping is really high to everyone.

06:36:59.300 --> 06:37:03.300
They've had plenty of time. Yeah, is everyone here? I think so.

06:37:03.300 --> 06:37:05.300
Hi hi, how's stream going?

06:37:05.300 --> 06:37:08.300
It's been going amazing. Look at me and the roofling gang, we're doing questing.

06:37:08.300 --> 06:37:11.300
Okay, I think everyone's got the plastic tube.

06:37:11.300 --> 06:37:13.300
They get the gauge and tube.

06:37:13.300 --> 06:37:15.300
Get the oil can next.

06:37:15.300 --> 06:37:17.300
So, open this door.

06:37:17.300 --> 06:37:19.300
We'll go through.

06:37:19.300 --> 06:37:21.300
Okay.

06:37:21.300 --> 06:37:23.300
I think we're all ready.

06:37:23.300 --> 06:37:25.300
Okay.

06:37:25.300 --> 06:37:28.300
Don't have the tube, but also got the gauge.

06:37:28.300 --> 06:37:30.300
Wait, you don't have the tube?

06:37:30.300 --> 06:37:32.300
No, I do have the tube.

06:37:33.300 --> 06:37:36.300
Okay, we need to interact with this blue thing over here.

06:37:36.300 --> 06:37:38.300
Wait, you've not got the tube?

06:37:38.300 --> 06:37:40.300
Who's not got the tube?

06:37:44.300 --> 06:37:47.300
Tube, you just run in and pick up when it spawns.

06:37:49.300 --> 06:37:52.300
Go in the closet and get the rubber if you don't have...

06:37:53.300 --> 06:37:55.300
I shouldn't have said that.

06:37:57.300 --> 06:37:59.300
Oh my god, the shadow band GB's Twitter.

06:37:59.300 --> 06:38:02.300
All of our Twitter's looks like a shadow band, it's ridiculous.

06:38:02.300 --> 06:38:05.300
Like how sensitive it is.

06:38:12.300 --> 06:38:14.300
Oh, what's that? It's a big thing.

06:38:14.300 --> 06:38:16.300
Oh, it's gone.

06:38:16.300 --> 06:38:18.300
Did they get the tube?

06:38:18.300 --> 06:38:20.300
Did you get the tube? I think so.

06:38:20.300 --> 06:38:22.300
All right, fun part of the quest. Let's go.

06:38:22.300 --> 06:38:24.300
Let's go. Oh, the door...

06:38:24.300 --> 06:38:26.300
The door's fine.

06:38:26.300 --> 06:38:28.300
Hold on, sorry, I probably just closed that door on you.

06:38:28.300 --> 06:38:30.300
Okay, search the bookcase.

06:38:30.300 --> 06:38:32.300
Search the bookcase.

06:38:32.300 --> 06:38:34.300
Oh, is that one by one?

06:38:34.300 --> 06:38:36.300
Maybe a one by one moment. Hold on.

06:38:36.300 --> 06:38:38.300
Hey, let's go.

06:38:38.300 --> 06:38:40.300
Okay, go down the ladder.

06:38:40.300 --> 06:38:42.300
Wait, go down the ladder when you're ready.

06:38:42.300 --> 06:38:44.300
Is that everyone? Yeah, that's everyone.

06:38:44.300 --> 06:38:46.300
Once you get through the bookshelf.

06:38:46.300 --> 06:38:48.300
Okay, we did it.

06:38:48.300 --> 06:38:50.300
The whole gang's here.

06:38:50.300 --> 06:38:52.300
No replaying left behind.

06:38:56.300 --> 06:38:58.300
Oh my god, we're beating up the rats, literally.

06:38:58.300 --> 06:39:00.300
Oh god, what do we do?

06:39:00.300 --> 06:39:02.300
Okay, there's a lever on the wall.

06:39:02.300 --> 06:39:04.300
Pull lever alpha on the wall over here.

06:39:06.300 --> 06:39:08.300
I assume this is going to be instanced to us.

06:39:08.300 --> 06:39:10.300
So...

06:39:10.300 --> 06:39:12.300
I don't know.

06:39:12.300 --> 06:39:14.300
Then pull lever, bravo.

06:39:14.300 --> 06:39:16.300
Oh, the music's all like...

06:39:20.300 --> 06:39:22.300
Okay.

06:39:22.300 --> 06:39:24.300
Now this gate is a jar.

06:39:28.300 --> 06:39:30.300
And English, if it's like slightly open,

06:39:30.300 --> 06:39:32.300
it's a jar.

06:39:32.300 --> 06:39:34.300
Pull lever D.

06:39:34.300 --> 06:39:36.300
Oh, I'll pull the D lever all day long.

06:39:36.300 --> 06:39:38.300
Come over here, weak one.

06:39:40.300 --> 06:39:42.300
What did that do?

06:39:42.300 --> 06:39:44.300
Okay.

06:39:46.300 --> 06:39:48.300
Oh god, it's a one by one gate.

06:39:48.300 --> 06:39:50.300
Why is there a biggest issue right now?

06:39:50.300 --> 06:39:52.300
One by one gate.

06:39:56.300 --> 06:39:58.300
Oil can has a slow respawn as well.

06:39:58.300 --> 06:40:00.300
I need an oil...

06:40:00.300 --> 06:40:02.300
I think we all need an oil can.

06:40:02.300 --> 06:40:04.300
So we're just going to have to go for it and be patient.

06:40:04.300 --> 06:40:06.300
I'm sure you can wait.

06:40:06.300 --> 06:40:08.300
I don't know if all the levers are the same for everyone.

06:40:08.300 --> 06:40:10.300
It looks like you guys are going different ways.

06:40:10.300 --> 06:40:12.300
So I think it might be different.

06:40:18.300 --> 06:40:20.300
World hop when you get into the room

06:40:20.300 --> 06:40:22.300
and then hop back.

06:40:22.300 --> 06:40:24.300
Yeah, you guys are really going different ways for me.

06:40:24.300 --> 06:40:26.300
So I think it's different for everyone.

06:40:28.300 --> 06:40:30.300
Oh, the classic one by one gate.

06:40:30.300 --> 06:40:32.300
It's over.

06:40:32.300 --> 06:40:34.300
Lever solution is the same for everyone.

06:40:34.300 --> 06:40:36.300
How's everyone going...

06:40:36.300 --> 06:40:38.300
Are you guys...

06:40:38.300 --> 06:40:40.300
Do you see this one?

06:40:40.300 --> 06:40:42.300
That way everyone can grab it faster.

06:40:42.300 --> 06:40:44.300
Yes.

06:40:46.300 --> 06:40:48.300
Okay.

06:40:48.300 --> 06:40:50.300
Okay.

06:40:52.300 --> 06:40:54.300
Okay.

06:40:54.300 --> 06:40:56.300
Okay, I love this runelight plugin

06:40:56.300 --> 06:40:58.300
because if I had to do this

06:40:58.300 --> 06:41:00.300
by my brain, it would be over.

06:41:08.300 --> 06:41:10.300
This is crazy.

06:41:14.300 --> 06:41:16.300
All levers are unique in their own way.

06:41:16.300 --> 06:41:18.300
Exactly.

06:41:18.300 --> 06:41:20.300
Wow.

06:41:20.300 --> 06:41:22.300
Let's see.

06:41:22.300 --> 06:41:24.300
Pull this lever.

06:41:24.300 --> 06:41:26.300
We're almost done.

06:41:26.300 --> 06:41:28.300
Okay, I was going to say that's like a lot of fricking questions.

06:41:28.300 --> 06:41:30.300
Oh wait, sorry.

06:41:30.300 --> 06:41:32.300
I'm going to see if my tea is at an acceptable temperature

06:41:32.300 --> 06:41:34.300
if I'm going to scold myself on it.

06:41:34.300 --> 06:41:36.300
That's why there's one or the other.

06:41:36.300 --> 06:41:38.300
That was...

06:41:44.300 --> 06:41:46.300
All these doors.

06:41:46.300 --> 06:41:48.300
Oh, right.

06:41:50.300 --> 06:41:52.300
Am I taking it?

06:41:52.300 --> 06:41:54.300
And then you guys are world hopping?

06:41:58.300 --> 06:42:00.300
And then you're coming back to this world?

06:42:02.300 --> 06:42:04.300
Yeah, this track is...

06:42:06.300 --> 06:42:08.300
Gen 2 based after

06:42:08.300 --> 06:42:10.300
old school runescape tracks

06:42:10.300 --> 06:42:12.300
question mark.

06:42:16.300 --> 06:42:18.300
Oh wait, I should be facing you today.

06:42:18.300 --> 06:42:20.300
Honestly,

06:42:20.300 --> 06:42:22.300
I wouldn't mind that.

06:42:22.300 --> 06:42:24.300
I'm kind of down for that.

06:42:24.300 --> 06:42:26.300
I was actually thinking of

06:42:26.300 --> 06:42:28.300
Legend of Zelda Minish Cap

06:42:28.300 --> 06:42:30.300
but brought

06:42:30.300 --> 06:42:32.300
to kind of modern standards

06:42:32.300 --> 06:42:34.300
for Gen 2.

06:42:34.300 --> 06:42:36.300
Runescape OSD?

06:42:38.300 --> 06:42:40.300
If we had like a mischievous little brat thing,

06:42:40.300 --> 06:42:42.300
this song

06:42:42.300 --> 06:42:44.300
was kind of like

06:42:44.300 --> 06:42:46.300
not Circus S.

06:42:46.300 --> 06:42:48.300
I guess it was Circus S.

06:42:48.300 --> 06:42:50.300
Does everyone have an oil can?

06:42:50.300 --> 06:42:52.300
Or...

06:42:52.300 --> 06:42:54.300
Oh, there's a respawn.

06:42:54.300 --> 06:42:56.300
That took a whole second.

06:42:56.300 --> 06:42:58.300
Everyone got an oil can?

06:42:58.300 --> 06:43:00.300
Maybe I know you're taking that now.

06:43:00.300 --> 06:43:02.300
Okay, if you have an oil can,

06:43:02.300 --> 06:43:04.300
go back out to the center over here.

06:43:04.300 --> 06:43:06.300
If you don't have an oil can,

06:43:06.300 --> 06:43:08.300
wait for it to spawn in that room

06:43:08.300 --> 06:43:10.300
or you can do what's called world hopping

06:43:10.300 --> 06:43:12.300
where you purposely swap to a new world

06:43:12.300 --> 06:43:14.300
and it should

06:43:14.300 --> 06:43:16.300
be like a new instance.

06:43:16.300 --> 06:43:18.300
But if you have an oil can, you're allowed to come out here.

06:43:20.300 --> 06:43:22.300
Minish is 20 years old now.

06:43:22.300 --> 06:43:24.300
Stubious brat.

06:43:26.300 --> 06:43:28.300
I would watch Zelda.

06:43:28.300 --> 06:43:30.300
I will uncontroll.

06:43:30.300 --> 06:43:32.300
I just want to support whoever gets sea shanty.

06:43:32.300 --> 06:43:34.300
No, it has to be like hidden,

06:43:34.300 --> 06:43:36.300
but when you know what it is, you know.

06:43:36.300 --> 06:43:38.300
Oh, there's a reefling there.

06:43:38.300 --> 06:43:40.300
We're not ready yet.

06:43:40.300 --> 06:43:42.300
I'll just check if anyone's back here.

06:43:42.300 --> 06:43:44.300
Other than that reefling.

06:43:44.300 --> 06:43:46.300
Oh, there's one there.

06:43:46.300 --> 06:43:48.300
I was just straight up reefling.

06:43:48.300 --> 06:43:50.300
You actually got the name reefling.

06:43:50.300 --> 06:43:52.300
I'm surprised no one else took it.

06:43:52.300 --> 06:43:54.300
I guess we'll just beat out...

06:43:54.300 --> 06:43:56.300
We're gonna beat up rats out here.

06:43:56.300 --> 06:43:58.300
Okay, we're just gonna get our combat level a bit higher.

06:43:58.300 --> 06:44:00.300
Oh, I just leveled up.

06:44:00.300 --> 06:44:02.300
What did I get? I got a taxix.

06:44:02.300 --> 06:44:04.300
Oh, there's spiders as well.

06:44:04.300 --> 06:44:06.300
Yeah, let's just level up her combat a little bit.

06:44:06.300 --> 06:44:08.300
Why not?

06:44:08.300 --> 06:44:10.300
Woo.

06:44:10.300 --> 06:44:12.300
Us following her gives me

06:44:12.300 --> 06:44:14.300
Ugandan knuckles flashbacks.

06:44:14.300 --> 06:44:16.300
This beat only fake queen.

06:44:18.300 --> 06:44:20.300
Would you hum shanty?

06:44:20.300 --> 06:44:22.300
Hmm.

06:44:22.300 --> 06:44:24.300
Hmm.

06:44:24.300 --> 06:44:26.300
Hmm.

06:44:26.300 --> 06:44:28.300
Hmm.

06:44:28.300 --> 06:44:30.300
Hmm.

06:44:30.300 --> 06:44:32.300
Hmm.

06:44:32.300 --> 06:44:34.300
Hmm.

06:44:34.300 --> 06:44:36.300
Hmm.

06:44:36.300 --> 06:44:38.300
Hmm.

06:44:38.300 --> 06:44:40.300
Hmm.

06:44:40.300 --> 06:44:42.300
Yeah, I managed to get the reefling name

06:44:42.300 --> 06:44:44.300
still five hours a day.

06:44:44.300 --> 06:44:46.300
Yeah.

06:44:46.300 --> 06:44:48.300
That's sea shanty.

06:44:48.300 --> 06:44:50.300
We're just leveling up her combat.

06:44:50.300 --> 06:44:52.300
Hmm.

06:44:52.300 --> 06:44:54.300
There's still a reefling over there getting absolutely...

06:44:54.300 --> 06:44:56.300
What are you getting annihilated by?

06:44:56.300 --> 06:44:58.300
A rat? Oh, okay, that's fine.

06:44:58.300 --> 06:45:00.300
And there's one there.

06:45:00.300 --> 06:45:02.300
There's a third?

06:45:02.300 --> 06:45:04.300
Yeah, we've got Hatsumiku chilling over there.

06:45:04.300 --> 06:45:06.300
Hmm.

06:45:06.300 --> 06:45:08.300
Hmm.

06:45:08.300 --> 06:45:10.300
Reefling.

06:45:10.300 --> 06:45:12.300
Now we have a max roll.

06:45:12.300 --> 06:45:14.300
Hmm.

06:45:14.300 --> 06:45:16.300
Let's get some level up.

06:45:16.300 --> 06:45:18.300
No way that rat just dunked my shield.

06:45:18.300 --> 06:45:20.300
I went bonk.

06:45:20.300 --> 06:45:22.300
Yeah, Amy would have chosen...

06:45:22.300 --> 06:45:24.300
Maybe.

06:45:24.300 --> 06:45:26.300
She would show us maybe.

06:45:26.300 --> 06:45:28.300
I remember that meme went like absolutely viral.

06:45:28.300 --> 06:45:30.300
Someone said that was the start

06:45:30.300 --> 06:45:32.300
of the brain rot meta

06:45:32.300 --> 06:45:34.300
when it comes to memes.

06:45:36.300 --> 06:45:38.300
Which I found rather unsafe.

06:45:38.300 --> 06:45:40.300
Wow.

06:45:42.300 --> 06:45:44.300
I think there's someone else

06:45:44.300 --> 06:45:46.300
that's fighting that.

06:45:46.300 --> 06:45:48.300
Here we go.

06:45:48.300 --> 06:45:50.300
We've almost got all over

06:45:50.300 --> 06:45:52.300
cans.

06:45:52.300 --> 06:45:54.300
And then we'll level up on fishy.

06:45:54.300 --> 06:45:56.300
I keep saying fishin'.

06:45:56.300 --> 06:45:58.300
It's not fishin', we're doing kootin'.

06:45:58.300 --> 06:46:00.300
My PCs fan just started

06:46:00.300 --> 06:46:02.300
up. I get nervous when my PCs...

06:46:02.300 --> 06:46:04.300
I'm like, what's wrong?

06:46:04.300 --> 06:46:06.300
What's wrong?

06:46:06.300 --> 06:46:08.300
Oh?

06:46:08.300 --> 06:46:10.300
Last reefling that needs to can?

06:46:10.300 --> 06:46:12.300
The question mark?

06:46:12.300 --> 06:46:14.300
I don't see anyone else doing the levers.

06:46:14.300 --> 06:46:16.300
Am I going crazy or are we clear?

06:46:16.300 --> 06:46:18.300
Have we did it?

06:46:18.300 --> 06:46:20.300
Are we ready to move on?

06:46:20.300 --> 06:46:22.300
Oh, he's done it.

06:46:22.300 --> 06:46:24.300
I don't want to say dancing.

06:46:24.300 --> 06:46:26.300
Okay, if everyone's got a can,

06:46:26.300 --> 06:46:28.300
up the ladders, please.

06:46:28.300 --> 06:46:30.300
Little reeflings, if everyone's got a can.

06:46:30.300 --> 06:46:32.300
Oh wait, no!

06:46:32.300 --> 06:46:34.300
Sorry, there's one more.

06:46:34.300 --> 06:46:36.300
I

06:46:36.300 --> 06:46:38.300
think they're still doing the lever

06:46:38.300 --> 06:46:40.300
stage.

06:46:40.300 --> 06:46:42.300
I'm sorry, reefling such a badger.

06:46:42.300 --> 06:46:44.300
You can come back down and we'll keep

06:46:44.300 --> 06:46:46.300
killing the means.

06:46:46.300 --> 06:46:48.300
He's

06:46:48.300 --> 06:46:50.300
going to be absolutely beaten up by

06:46:50.300 --> 06:46:52.300
that rat, so he'll help you out.

06:46:52.300 --> 06:46:54.300
There you go.

06:46:54.300 --> 06:46:56.300
Uh...

06:47:00.300 --> 06:47:02.300
Did you get it?

06:47:02.300 --> 06:47:04.300
I don't know.

06:47:06.300 --> 06:47:08.300
Did you get it?

06:47:08.300 --> 06:47:10.300
You're moving around erratically

06:47:10.300 --> 06:47:12.300
as a reefling...

06:47:14.300 --> 06:47:16.300
I don't know, are you stuck

06:47:16.300 --> 06:47:18.300
on the levers?

06:47:18.300 --> 06:47:20.300
You're not taping.

06:47:20.300 --> 06:47:22.300
Go on, I'll catch up.

06:47:22.300 --> 06:47:24.300
Are you sure, reeflings?

06:47:24.300 --> 06:47:26.300
I won't feel anyone feel left out.

06:47:28.300 --> 06:47:30.300
VR chat was well,

06:47:30.300 --> 06:47:32.300
and that's just

06:47:32.300 --> 06:47:34.300
a bit weird.

06:47:34.300 --> 06:47:36.300
I was going to have to play VR chat

06:47:36.300 --> 06:47:38.300
to learn how the

06:47:38.300 --> 06:47:40.300
3D models work. I have no idea how that

06:47:40.300 --> 06:47:42.300
3D model streaming works.

06:47:42.300 --> 06:47:44.300
But I don't know if you can use

06:47:44.300 --> 06:47:46.300
other programs as well.

06:47:46.300 --> 06:47:48.300
Oh, I'm leveling combat,

06:47:48.300 --> 06:47:50.300
not to brag.

06:47:56.300 --> 06:47:58.300
You will learn.

06:47:58.300 --> 06:48:00.300
Can you say error again?

06:48:00.300 --> 06:48:02.300
Error?

06:48:02.300 --> 06:48:04.300
Error.

06:48:04.300 --> 06:48:06.300
Error, switching tracks.

06:48:06.300 --> 06:48:08.300
You don't need to use VR chat

06:48:08.300 --> 06:48:10.300
for 3D models.

06:48:10.300 --> 06:48:12.300
I honestly don't know

06:48:12.300 --> 06:48:14.300
anything about it. The girls want 3D models,

06:48:14.300 --> 06:48:16.300
and I'll pay for it.

06:48:16.300 --> 06:48:18.300
That's pretty much all I know about 3D models.

06:48:18.300 --> 06:48:20.300
I'm like, joking.

06:48:20.300 --> 06:48:22.300
If they want 3D models, they'll get it.

06:48:26.300 --> 06:48:28.300
VR chat isn't interesting at all.

06:48:28.300 --> 06:48:30.300
Oh!

06:48:30.300 --> 06:48:32.300
I've saw VR

06:48:32.300 --> 06:48:34.300
ASMR videos. I thought that was pretty cool.

06:48:36.300 --> 06:48:38.300
And plus, it would be cool to see

06:48:38.300 --> 06:48:40.300
the height difference of the girls as well.

06:48:40.300 --> 06:48:42.300
Go on, y'all.

06:48:42.300 --> 06:48:44.300
Okay, okay.

06:48:44.300 --> 06:48:46.300
We're being sent away by the

06:48:46.300 --> 06:48:48.300
reflying, right? Upstairs, everyone.

06:48:48.300 --> 06:48:50.300
We're being sent away.

06:48:50.300 --> 06:48:52.300
Upstairs.

06:48:52.300 --> 06:48:54.300
Okay, there's a lever here.

06:48:54.300 --> 06:48:56.300
Pull the lever, crunk!

06:48:58.300 --> 06:49:00.300
Oh! Okay, okay, okay.

06:49:00.300 --> 06:49:02.300
Right, we need to go up the stairs again.

06:49:02.300 --> 06:49:04.300
Right, let's go back here.

06:49:04.300 --> 06:49:06.300
I'mma sip my tea.

06:49:06.300 --> 06:49:08.300
Okay.

06:49:10.300 --> 06:49:12.300
You literally talk like a real mummy

06:49:12.300 --> 06:49:14.300
with the girls. They want 3D models.

06:49:14.300 --> 06:49:16.300
Yeah, I'll just pay for it, darlin'. There you go, darlin'.

06:49:16.300 --> 06:49:18.300
All yours. I don't know what it's about,

06:49:18.300 --> 06:49:20.300
but you just enjoy yourself.

06:49:20.300 --> 06:49:22.300
It's true. They'll be like, I want this.

06:49:22.300 --> 06:49:24.300
I'm like, oh, you just, oh, you get it.

06:49:24.300 --> 06:49:26.300
You just enjoy yourself, hen.

06:49:28.300 --> 06:49:30.300
Right, okay. Talk to the professor at the top of the stairs.

06:49:30.300 --> 06:49:32.300
Oh, you found anything yet?

06:49:32.300 --> 06:49:34.300
I have everything. Give them to me here, then.

06:49:34.300 --> 06:49:36.300
All his.

06:49:36.300 --> 06:49:38.300
Oh, you put them.

06:49:38.300 --> 06:49:40.300
Noises are being made?

06:49:40.300 --> 06:49:42.300
He's a man!

06:49:42.300 --> 06:49:44.300
Thank you, madame. I was dreadfully irritating being a chicken.

06:49:44.300 --> 06:49:46.300
How can I ever thank you?

06:49:46.300 --> 06:49:48.300
Well, a cash reward is always nice.

06:49:48.300 --> 06:49:50.300
Of course, of course!

06:49:50.300 --> 06:49:52.300
You're awarded 4 quest points of 300 coins.

06:49:52.300 --> 06:49:54.300
Yay!

06:49:54.300 --> 06:49:56.300
That was really quick. Other than, like,

06:49:56.300 --> 06:49:58.300
the horrific issues.

06:49:58.300 --> 06:50:00.300
That was like a really quick quest.

06:50:00.300 --> 06:50:02.300
Um...

06:50:02.300 --> 06:50:04.300
Right, we're not doing any more questing.

06:50:04.300 --> 06:50:06.300
We're leveling up.

06:50:06.300 --> 06:50:08.300
Next.

06:50:08.300 --> 06:50:10.300
Money, let's go!

06:50:10.300 --> 06:50:12.300
What is this pressure gauge?

06:50:12.300 --> 06:50:14.300
Don't touch it. It's going to explode.

06:50:14.300 --> 06:50:16.300
What do we do?

06:50:16.300 --> 06:50:18.300
What pressure gauge?

06:50:18.300 --> 06:50:20.300
It's really like any other scientific

06:50:20.300 --> 06:50:22.300
thing.

06:50:22.300 --> 06:50:24.300
I guess that's it, and we just leave.

06:50:24.300 --> 06:50:26.300
But that...

06:50:26.300 --> 06:50:28.300
It's in the fountain.

06:50:28.300 --> 06:50:30.300
It's in the fountain. That's why you need to poison it.

06:50:30.300 --> 06:50:32.300
How bizarre.

06:50:32.300 --> 06:50:34.300
Oh, there's the fish food.

06:50:34.300 --> 06:50:36.300
Ugh!

06:50:36.300 --> 06:50:38.300
I guess that's it. We're already

06:50:38.300 --> 06:50:40.300
freaking done this quest. Hold on.

06:50:40.300 --> 06:50:42.300
Wah.

06:50:42.300 --> 06:50:44.300
Oh wait, why did you not let me out that door?

06:50:46.300 --> 06:50:48.300
Open large door.

06:50:48.300 --> 06:50:50.300
Wait, why does it make me turn backwards?

06:50:52.300 --> 06:50:54.300
I keep... It doesn't let me out this door?

06:50:54.300 --> 06:50:56.300
Open large door.

06:50:56.300 --> 06:50:58.300
It won't open.

06:50:58.300 --> 06:51:00.300
Front door is one way.

06:51:00.300 --> 06:51:02.300
Oh, so we have to

06:51:02.300 --> 06:51:04.300
go all the way around again?

06:51:04.300 --> 06:51:06.300
Oh, okay.

06:51:06.300 --> 06:51:08.300
Another interesting take

06:51:08.300 --> 06:51:10.300
from the dev team?

06:51:10.300 --> 06:51:12.300
Alright, let me sip into my tea.

06:51:14.300 --> 06:51:16.300
Okay, yeah.

06:51:16.300 --> 06:51:18.300
I'll go another one by one door.

06:51:18.300 --> 06:51:20.300
It's over.

06:51:20.300 --> 06:51:22.300
The chair's chasing me.

06:51:22.300 --> 06:51:24.300
Can you even go that way?

06:51:24.300 --> 06:51:26.300
Can you even go that way?

06:51:26.300 --> 06:51:28.300
Oh, you can. You can come around this side?

06:51:30.300 --> 06:51:32.300
Can you teach me?

06:51:32.300 --> 06:51:34.300
Why to play Rensuke Tempah?

06:51:36.300 --> 06:51:38.300
Get ready. Go right back.

06:51:40.300 --> 06:51:42.300
Ow! The tree!

06:51:44.300 --> 06:51:46.300
I don't want to go in a fight. Move!

06:51:46.300 --> 06:51:48.300
What's going on? Why can't I move?

06:51:48.300 --> 06:51:50.300
Hello?

06:51:50.300 --> 06:51:52.300
Am I missing?

06:51:52.300 --> 06:51:54.300
Why can't I not...

06:51:54.300 --> 06:51:56.300
Why? That tree literally

06:51:56.300 --> 06:51:58.300
had me in a death grip. Oh my gosh.

06:52:00.300 --> 06:52:02.300
Mostly was a...

06:52:02.300 --> 06:52:04.300
a guy of fun.

06:52:04.300 --> 06:52:06.300
Don't get skill checked by a tree.

06:52:06.300 --> 06:52:08.300
Literally, one error.

06:52:08.300 --> 06:52:10.300
I almost died there.

06:52:10.300 --> 06:52:12.300
I think the tree liked you, honestly.

06:52:14.300 --> 06:52:16.300
Okay, we made it.

06:52:16.300 --> 06:52:18.300
But I don't think that's all the reeflings.

06:52:18.300 --> 06:52:20.300
This is dangerous, literally. Oh, there's a reefling there.

06:52:22.300 --> 06:52:24.300
Right, we'll wait until a cool army.

06:52:24.300 --> 06:52:26.300
I have an army of reeflings requesting,

06:52:26.300 --> 06:52:28.300
but we're about to go level up our cooking next.

06:52:28.300 --> 06:52:30.300
I'm trying to finish my honey tea

06:52:30.300 --> 06:52:32.300
before it gets cold.

06:52:34.300 --> 06:52:36.300
Wah! Okay.

06:52:36.300 --> 06:52:38.300
Um, next thing

06:52:38.300 --> 06:52:40.300
we're going to do is we're going to

06:52:40.300 --> 06:52:42.300
travel north. We're going to take

06:52:42.300 --> 06:52:44.300
a west and then north

06:52:44.300 --> 06:52:46.300
and we're going to be outside

06:52:46.300 --> 06:52:48.300
the village.

06:52:48.300 --> 06:52:50.300
But we need to go get fish and rods and stuff.

06:52:50.300 --> 06:52:52.300
I don't think there's a fish shop nearby.

06:52:52.300 --> 06:52:54.300
So I think we're going to go to the Grand Exchange

06:52:54.300 --> 06:52:56.300
and buy fish and rods.

06:52:56.300 --> 06:52:58.300
Army, definitely not cold.

06:52:58.300 --> 06:53:00.300
Yeah.

06:53:00.300 --> 06:53:02.300
This music has given me

06:53:02.300 --> 06:53:04.300
a fatal dose of nostalgia.

06:53:04.300 --> 06:53:06.300
Passed so much

06:53:06.300 --> 06:53:08.300
since the last Get Rektor is.

06:53:08.300 --> 06:53:10.300
Hmm.

06:53:10.300 --> 06:53:12.300
As I get stuck

06:53:12.300 --> 06:53:14.300
I'm ruffling fans and bye.

06:53:14.300 --> 06:53:16.300
I've never gotten a runescape.

06:53:16.300 --> 06:53:18.300
It's like either you got into it or you didn't.

06:53:18.300 --> 06:53:20.300
Right, I think that's everyone.

06:53:20.300 --> 06:53:22.300
Hopefully, question mark.

06:53:22.300 --> 06:53:24.300
As we head banger way of victory.

06:53:24.300 --> 06:53:26.300
I don't know about the other

06:53:26.300 --> 06:53:28.300
reefling that got stuck and sent us forward

06:53:28.300 --> 06:53:30.300
but thank you for not holding us back.

06:53:30.300 --> 06:53:32.300
By the same time I feel bad

06:53:32.300 --> 06:53:34.300
because it's like the whole point of this is to

06:53:34.300 --> 06:53:36.300
the question and stuff together.

06:53:36.300 --> 06:53:38.300
Right, let's get in the nicer parts of the channel.

06:53:38.300 --> 06:53:40.300
Let the evil at bay

06:53:40.300 --> 06:53:42.300
type of thing go away.

06:53:42.300 --> 06:53:44.300
Wait, let me finish my tea.

06:53:46.300 --> 06:53:48.300
Either you got into it

06:53:48.300 --> 06:53:50.300
and you're still playing this day or you didn't.

06:53:50.300 --> 06:53:52.300
I got into Guild Wars instead.

06:53:52.300 --> 06:53:54.300
I never played Guild Wars.

06:53:54.300 --> 06:53:56.300
Hmm.

06:53:56.300 --> 06:53:58.300
Hmm.

06:53:58.300 --> 06:54:00.300
Hmm.

06:54:00.300 --> 06:54:02.300
Trying to finish this.

06:54:02.300 --> 06:54:04.300
Ah.

06:54:04.300 --> 06:54:06.300
Oh, I thought it gave us feathers but it didn't.

06:54:06.300 --> 06:54:08.300
I was just an image of a feather because we need

06:54:08.300 --> 06:54:10.300
feathers to do fishing.

06:54:10.300 --> 06:54:12.300
Hmm.

06:54:12.300 --> 06:54:14.300
Hmm.

06:54:14.300 --> 06:54:16.300
I was so into it and was so shy that

06:54:16.300 --> 06:54:18.300
in taping class I'd want big letters, RuneScape rules

06:54:18.300 --> 06:54:20.300
and wait for someone to see it and ask me if I played.

06:54:20.300 --> 06:54:22.300
Aww, that's such a shame.

06:54:26.300 --> 06:54:28.300
Feathers, we need feathers.

06:54:28.300 --> 06:54:30.300
Birds of a feather.

06:54:30.300 --> 06:54:32.300
Right, we're gonna take

06:54:32.300 --> 06:54:34.300
a left

06:54:34.300 --> 06:54:36.300
and go...

06:54:36.300 --> 06:54:38.300
Oh wait, no. Do we need to go to Port Sarim?

06:54:40.300 --> 06:54:42.300
I think we actually need to go to the fishing

06:54:42.300 --> 06:54:44.300
shop to buy our rod and feathers.

06:54:44.300 --> 06:54:46.300
The fishing shops

06:54:46.300 --> 06:54:48.300
are west

06:54:48.300 --> 06:54:50.300
and south so we'll go west and south.

06:54:50.300 --> 06:54:52.300
Just follow me

06:54:52.300 --> 06:54:54.300
with my golden stuff.

06:54:54.300 --> 06:54:56.300
Oh no, I'm gonna follow the rabbit.

06:54:58.300 --> 06:55:00.300
We follow the rabbit. You coming?

06:55:00.300 --> 06:55:02.300
Refling?

06:55:02.300 --> 06:55:04.300
Yes.

06:55:04.300 --> 06:55:06.300
Uh...

06:55:08.300 --> 06:55:10.300
Take us westward and then south

06:55:10.300 --> 06:55:12.300
on the main road.

06:55:12.300 --> 06:55:14.300
Feathers. Oh no, am I saying feathers?

06:55:14.300 --> 06:55:16.300
Oh, we need some feathers.

06:55:16.300 --> 06:55:18.300
Wait, how did you say feathers?

06:55:18.300 --> 06:55:20.300
Feathers.

06:55:20.300 --> 06:55:22.300
Feathers. Feathers.

06:55:22.300 --> 06:55:24.300
Oh, it sounds like I'm kind of

06:55:24.300 --> 06:55:26.300
saying father.

06:55:26.300 --> 06:55:28.300
I guess. Feathers.

06:55:28.300 --> 06:55:30.300
Your father.

06:55:30.300 --> 06:55:32.300
In this line you also say

06:55:32.300 --> 06:55:34.300
your father, isn't it?

06:55:34.300 --> 06:55:36.300
And it's like, ah, that's my dad.

06:55:36.300 --> 06:55:38.300
I don't want change.

06:55:40.300 --> 06:55:42.300
I never played Guild Wars Organscape.

06:55:42.300 --> 06:55:44.300
I want silly Scottish women!

06:55:46.300 --> 06:55:48.300
Feathers.

06:55:48.300 --> 06:55:50.300
Your wee feathers.

06:55:50.300 --> 06:55:52.300
You'd weave it behind, Refling.

06:55:52.300 --> 06:55:54.300
You'd put your wee running boots on.

06:55:54.300 --> 06:55:56.300
You'd put your...

06:56:02.300 --> 06:56:04.300
Feathers.

06:56:04.300 --> 06:56:06.300
Feathers.

06:56:06.300 --> 06:56:08.300
Feathers.

06:56:08.300 --> 06:56:10.300
Feathers.

06:56:10.300 --> 06:56:12.300
Feathers.

06:56:12.300 --> 06:56:14.300
Feathers.

06:56:14.300 --> 06:56:16.300
Feathers.

06:56:16.300 --> 06:56:18.300
Feathers.

06:56:18.300 --> 06:56:20.300
Feathers.

06:56:20.300 --> 06:56:22.300
Feathers.

06:56:22.300 --> 06:56:24.300
Feathers.

06:56:24.300 --> 06:56:26.300
Feathers.

06:56:26.300 --> 06:56:28.300
Oh, we're gonna do a brawl.

06:56:28.300 --> 06:56:30.300
Uh... at the end of the stream

06:56:30.300 --> 06:56:37.300
We're going to hop over the wall and fist fight each other and I'm going to get a rose and I'll give it to whoever wins the 50 cups.

06:56:39.300 --> 06:56:41.300
Oh, pardon me, I'm broken.

06:56:43.300 --> 06:56:48.300
Ok, in this shop you will need to buy a rod. Most of you already have one.

06:56:49.300 --> 06:56:51.300
Ah, you guys so fast.

06:56:51.300 --> 06:56:57.300
So trade with Garrett and then buy... oh no, there's only one.

06:56:58.300 --> 06:57:01.300
That costs five coin, so buy one.

06:57:02.300 --> 06:57:05.300
Do we need feathers or do we need the fishing bait?

06:57:06.300 --> 06:57:08.300
Is it a fishing bait we need?

06:57:10.300 --> 06:57:12.300
I made this tea so honey.

06:57:15.300 --> 06:57:18.300
Oh that's sweet, that's too sweet. I can actually finish that.

06:57:19.300 --> 06:57:25.300
All the sweetness is at the bottom. Feathers for trout and salmon.

06:57:28.300 --> 06:57:30.300
Is that ticking up? Oh it is.

06:57:35.300 --> 06:57:37.300
I don't have the money.

06:57:38.300 --> 06:57:39.300
Or maybe I do.

06:57:41.300 --> 06:57:44.300
Ok, that's all I can buy with what I've got.

06:57:44.300 --> 06:57:58.300
I haven't got enough for anything else. I've got 73 feathers, I didn't think this far ahead.

06:58:01.300 --> 06:58:04.300
I opened a stream and didn't see you here.

06:58:08.300 --> 06:58:10.300
I wish this to trade with you, except trade.

06:58:14.300 --> 06:58:15.300
Eh, I still have a key.

06:58:16.300 --> 06:58:20.300
Oh, that's going to be a lot of feathers to spread about, not going to lie.

06:58:21.300 --> 06:58:23.300
How do you have so much money?

06:58:24.300 --> 06:58:27.300
Right, let me buy feathers for... what are these? Feather pack?

06:58:28.300 --> 06:58:29.300
What's that?

06:58:30.300 --> 06:58:32.300
I don't know. If I buy fifth... oh you can.

06:58:35.300 --> 06:58:38.300
Oh, that's so smart! Inside the feather pack.

06:58:39.300 --> 06:58:41.300
I'm going to keep some heels on me.

06:58:42.300 --> 06:58:45.300
Right, I can give feather packs to reeflings.

06:58:48.300 --> 06:58:50.300
Why does that not buy when I click it?

06:58:52.300 --> 06:58:55.300
Wait, I'm dropping them! Oh, hold on, I'm being dumb.

06:58:57.300 --> 06:58:59.300
I can trade the feather packs.

06:59:00.300 --> 06:59:03.300
Ok, I've got like a thousand feathers now. Who needs feathers?

06:59:05.300 --> 06:59:07.300
I think everyone needs feathers, honestly.

06:59:07.300 --> 06:59:10.300
If you need feathers, trade me and I'll give you... wait, actually.

06:59:11.300 --> 06:59:13.300
I should like give 200 feathers each?

06:59:17.300 --> 06:59:20.300
I'll just say buy 50 and then I'll give 200 feathers.

06:59:28.300 --> 06:59:31.300
I love spreading feathers on my...

06:59:32.300 --> 06:59:34.300
Should we get a harpy? We should totally get a harpy.

06:59:34.300 --> 06:59:36.300
I'm glad to take a feather pack.

06:59:36.300 --> 06:59:39.300
Ok, trade me if you need feathers. I'll try and give you like 200.

06:59:40.300 --> 06:59:43.300
Whose outfit is that? Is that even a reefling? Are you a reefling?

06:59:43.300 --> 06:59:46.300
I don't know. I think that might just be someone caught in the crossfire.

06:59:47.300 --> 06:59:51.300
Right, let's see. Accept and then offer...

06:59:52.300 --> 06:59:54.300
200 and then we'll go fishing.

06:59:55.300 --> 06:59:56.300
Accept.

06:59:58.300 --> 07:00:00.300
Wait, what? Hold on.

07:00:00.300 --> 07:00:02.300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, why did that not work?

07:00:02.300 --> 07:00:04.300
200 and I...

07:00:04.300 --> 07:00:06.300
Yeah. Oh, jeez. Sorry.

07:00:07.300 --> 07:00:09.300
I don't know where that went. It just disappeared into space.

07:00:11.300 --> 07:00:14.300
Ok, there's 200 for you and then there's two...

07:00:15.300 --> 07:00:16.300
How dare you?

07:00:19.300 --> 07:00:20.300
Just trying to see.

07:00:23.300 --> 07:00:24.300
And then 200 for you.

07:00:25.300 --> 07:00:27.300
And then sugar mummy.

07:00:28.300 --> 07:00:31.300
You say that as if a reefling didn't just hand me all of his paycheck and runescape.

07:00:33.300 --> 07:00:36.300
Where's Johnny at now? We're at Port Sarim.

07:00:37.300 --> 07:00:38.300
We're on World 380.

07:00:39.300 --> 07:00:42.300
We're currently at Port Sarim buying...

07:00:43.300 --> 07:00:45.300
Ok, my PC just sped up trying to zoom that in.

07:00:46.300 --> 07:00:51.300
And then we're going to go up to Barbarian Village to get salmon because there's a permanent fire there.

07:00:57.300 --> 07:00:59.300
And we'll do 200.

07:01:00.300 --> 07:01:03.300
No, I've done it again. Sorry. I keep teasing you with a feather.

07:01:04.300 --> 07:01:05.300
I've done it again!

07:01:07.300 --> 07:01:08.300
I can't stop teasing you right now.

07:01:09.300 --> 07:01:11.300
I'm tickling you with the feathers.

07:01:11.300 --> 07:01:14.300
I'm like, oh, do you want the feather and like tickle you and then run away with it?

07:01:15.300 --> 07:01:18.300
Like pushing it against your face like ASMR and then like...

07:01:20.300 --> 07:01:22.300
You need feathers too.

07:01:22.300 --> 07:01:26.300
I'll buy a ton as well so when we head over there, we should be fine.

07:01:26.300 --> 07:01:30.300
So if you need more, I can always get like always just trade more.

07:01:31.300 --> 07:01:33.300
Teasing us with a feather, honestly.

07:01:39.300 --> 07:01:42.300
Thank you, pretty lady. Played with me.

07:01:45.300 --> 07:01:48.300
Has everyone got what they... Where the heck is the guy?

07:01:48.300 --> 07:01:50.300
Where's the NPC to buy, awful?

07:01:50.300 --> 07:01:52.300
I can't see. There's too many of us.

07:01:53.300 --> 07:01:55.300
It's Miss. He's not for me.

07:01:56.300 --> 07:01:58.300
Alright, where's the guy to buy freaking things off?

07:01:58.300 --> 07:01:59.300
Oh, there he is.

07:02:01.300 --> 07:02:04.300
Gonna buy like a bunch of feather packs and open them up.

07:02:07.300 --> 07:02:09.300
Oh my god, have I already spent 10k on feathers?

07:02:09.300 --> 07:02:12.300
Jeez, this game is not cheap. The economy's in shambles.

07:02:17.300 --> 07:02:20.300
Right, that's like literally almost 5k. That's more than enough.

07:02:20.300 --> 07:02:23.300
Does anyone else... You need some too.

07:02:27.300 --> 07:02:29.300
Does that work? It did work, thank goodness.

07:02:29.300 --> 07:02:33.300
How did you know that our weaknesses are feathers? Stop using your powers on us.

07:02:33.300 --> 07:02:36.300
I don't think I ever thought of feathers. Did I do a tickling?

07:02:36.300 --> 07:02:41.300
I may have got... I don't think I got... No, I think I got you tickling me artwork.

07:02:42.300 --> 07:02:43.300
You're welcome.

07:02:43.300 --> 07:02:47.300
Does anyone else need any feathers?

07:02:47.300 --> 07:02:49.300
Or are we all ready to go?

07:02:50.300 --> 07:02:53.300
We need to thank Sugar Daddy, Weflin...

07:02:55.300 --> 07:02:58.300
The one that gave me poison that I thought was being bred.

07:02:58.300 --> 07:03:01.300
I realised and I was like, I didn't accept the quest and had to loop with the chick.

07:03:01.300 --> 07:03:04.300
Oh no, sorry, did you manage?

07:03:04.300 --> 07:03:06.300
I could take some please.

07:03:11.300 --> 07:03:12.300
Trade.

07:03:12.300 --> 07:03:15.300
And then offer X amount.

07:03:15.300 --> 07:03:18.300
Alright, has everyone got a rod? Not the one that's already attached to you.

07:03:18.300 --> 07:03:21.300
One bought from the thing.

07:03:21.300 --> 07:03:25.300
Were you giggling? Were you Sugar Daddy, Weflin and...

07:03:25.300 --> 07:03:26.300
Giggling?

07:03:33.300 --> 07:03:35.300
Kill... What's... What's heavier?

07:03:35.300 --> 07:03:36.300
Kilograms.

07:03:36.300 --> 07:03:40.300
Right, is everyone ready to do the walk? The walk.

07:03:42.300 --> 07:03:45.300
Yes, I finished it. Oh no, you need some... Hold up.

07:03:45.300 --> 07:03:46.300
Except trade.

07:03:46.300 --> 07:03:48.300
We're getting there, we're getting there.

07:03:49.300 --> 07:03:51.300
Wait, no, I don't... No, I don't need your rod.

07:03:51.300 --> 07:03:53.300
Stop, I don't need your rod.

07:03:53.300 --> 07:03:55.300
You keep your rod to yourself, Weflin.

07:03:55.300 --> 07:03:57.300
It's not the time for that.

07:04:02.300 --> 07:04:03.300
I do have a rod for vision.

07:04:03.300 --> 07:04:05.300
Now I need some feathers, thanks.

07:04:05.300 --> 07:04:07.300
Sugar would catch up me.

07:04:07.300 --> 07:04:11.300
Right, is everyone ready to follow me and I'll take us to Barbarian?

07:04:11.300 --> 07:04:13.300
You need a fly fishing rod for the fishes.

07:04:14.300 --> 07:04:17.300
Oh, we need a specific type of rod. Of course we do.

07:04:17.300 --> 07:04:20.300
What rod of alcohol? I've got a fishing rod.

07:04:20.300 --> 07:04:22.300
I need a fly rod. Hold on, trade Garrett.

07:04:26.300 --> 07:04:27.300
Fly fishing rod.

07:04:27.300 --> 07:04:32.300
Right, does everyone have a fly fishing rod?

07:04:32.300 --> 07:04:34.300
Before we move on to the next location.

07:04:36.300 --> 07:04:39.300
Lesson two hour warning for Mercy Modest.

07:04:40.300 --> 07:04:41.300
Nope.

07:04:42.300 --> 07:04:43.300
Do you need...

07:04:44.300 --> 07:04:45.300
Me...

07:04:46.300 --> 07:04:47.300
To...

07:04:48.300 --> 07:04:49.300
Oh.

07:04:50.300 --> 07:04:51.300
I hope it restokes.

07:04:51.300 --> 07:04:52.300
You're out.

07:04:53.300 --> 07:04:55.300
I do have a pretty fly rod.

07:04:55.300 --> 07:04:57.300
Pretty fly for a white guy.

07:04:57.300 --> 07:05:00.300
You know it's kinda hard just to get along today.

07:05:01.300 --> 07:05:02.300
He asked for...

07:05:02.300 --> 07:05:04.300
What's that? He asked for ink.

07:05:04.300 --> 07:05:06.300
He asked for a 13 year.

07:05:06.300 --> 07:05:08.300
Instead they drew a fairy one.

07:05:08.300 --> 07:05:09.300
It's a fairy one.

07:05:20.300 --> 07:05:22.300
I don't know... They're not restocking.

07:05:22.300 --> 07:05:24.300
They're like so slow to restock.

07:05:25.300 --> 07:05:26.300
I don't know if I can...

07:05:26.300 --> 07:05:27.300
Wait, we are...

07:05:27.300 --> 07:05:29.300
We're gonna be right next to the grand exchange.

07:05:29.300 --> 07:05:31.300
Maybe I'll buy some off the grand exchange.

07:05:33.300 --> 07:05:34.300
I'll go with the grand exchange.

07:05:34.300 --> 07:05:35.300
Yeah, okay.

07:05:35.300 --> 07:05:37.300
We're gonna make it to the grand exchange.

07:05:37.300 --> 07:05:38.300
Don't worry.

07:05:38.300 --> 07:05:40.300
If you don't have a fly freshen rod,

07:05:40.300 --> 07:05:42.300
we're gonna be very close to the grand exchange.

07:05:42.300 --> 07:05:43.300
So don't worry.

07:05:43.300 --> 07:05:44.300
You can follow me.

07:05:45.300 --> 07:05:46.300
Follow Golden...

07:05:46.300 --> 07:05:47.300
Golden me.

07:05:48.300 --> 07:05:50.300
Is there any more reasons in that shop?

07:05:50.300 --> 07:05:51.300
I actually can't tell.

07:05:51.300 --> 07:05:52.300
The camera is like...

07:05:52.300 --> 07:05:54.300
I'm sure there's a way to turn off first.

07:05:54.300 --> 07:05:55.300
But...

07:05:55.300 --> 07:05:57.300
Right, we'll follow...

07:05:57.300 --> 07:05:58.300
Our...

07:05:58.300 --> 07:05:59.300
Gated...

07:05:59.300 --> 07:06:01.300
Our gate, our bunny gate.

07:06:01.300 --> 07:06:03.300
A little hopsy.

07:06:04.300 --> 07:06:05.300
I hope I'm right.

07:06:05.300 --> 07:06:06.300
Yeah, okay.

07:06:06.300 --> 07:06:07.300
This is in the...

07:06:07.300 --> 07:06:08.300
The shop.

07:06:08.300 --> 07:06:09.300
Everyone's here.

07:06:11.300 --> 07:06:13.300
We're going to go to the grand exchange

07:06:13.300 --> 07:06:15.300
to make sure everyone has a fly freshen rod

07:06:15.300 --> 07:06:18.300
and to also deposit all of our items

07:06:18.300 --> 07:06:20.300
because our inventory's getting like

07:06:20.300 --> 07:06:21.300
pretty full of stuff.

07:06:21.300 --> 07:06:22.300
And I don't want to be walking around

07:06:22.300 --> 07:06:23.300
with like so much money.

07:06:27.300 --> 07:06:28.300
Oh, there's the brawl.

07:06:28.300 --> 07:06:30.300
This is where we're gonna do a bar brawl.

07:06:31.300 --> 07:06:32.300
In a bar.

07:06:37.300 --> 07:06:38.300
Da-da-da-da-da...

07:06:38.300 --> 07:06:40.300
Do-a-da-da-da...

07:06:40.300 --> 07:06:41.300
Yay, bye!

07:06:42.300 --> 07:06:43.300
Ba-kuh-ba-kuh-ba-inter bolt...

07:06:44.300 --> 07:06:45.300
Ah!

07:06:46.300 --> 07:06:48.300
You can always hover over

07:06:48.300 --> 07:06:49.300
and then just say follow.

07:06:51.300 --> 07:06:52.300
Follow...

07:06:53.300 --> 07:06:54.300
Follow the leader, leader.

07:06:54.300 --> 07:06:55.300
Oh, no, someone got stopped

07:06:55.300 --> 07:06:56.300
by a mysterious old man.

07:06:56.300 --> 07:06:57.300
Oh, you should always talk to

07:06:57.300 --> 07:06:59.300
the mysterious old man

07:06:59.300 --> 07:07:00.300
he'll give you, um...

07:07:01.300 --> 07:07:02.300
Gemstone!

07:07:02.300 --> 07:07:03.300
An uncut gemstone.

07:07:03.300 --> 07:07:04.140
Put James in.

07:07:05.940 --> 07:07:07.100
Okay, we're all ready.

07:07:07.100 --> 07:07:08.660
Follow the leader leader.

07:07:08.660 --> 07:07:11.380
Our ink shall block the sun.

07:07:11.380 --> 07:07:12.740
I have 10 strongies.

07:07:12.740 --> 07:07:14.180
I got some there already.

07:07:14.180 --> 07:07:15.180
Okay, okay, okay.

07:07:19.180 --> 07:07:21.580
Always talk to the mysterious old man, Godot.

07:07:22.460 --> 07:07:24.660
Isn't that in...

07:07:24.660 --> 07:07:27.300
Sometimes he gives you a maze to run through.

07:07:27.300 --> 07:07:28.140
Oh.

07:07:29.380 --> 07:07:31.540
The series old man giving uncut things.

07:07:31.620 --> 07:07:32.460
Say yo.

07:07:35.020 --> 07:07:37.700
The old man can offer to send you to solve a maze

07:07:37.700 --> 07:07:40.060
and that one gives amazing rewards.

07:07:40.060 --> 07:07:41.140
Okay, okay.

07:07:42.060 --> 07:07:44.860
I know the signage lady doesn't give you anything good.

07:07:44.860 --> 07:07:48.300
I'm like 99% sure she gives you a bit of cabbage or something.

07:07:53.220 --> 07:07:55.420
I like this spinning one.

07:07:55.420 --> 07:07:56.380
I can't remember what it is.

07:07:56.380 --> 07:07:57.780
It's like the item spins around

07:07:57.780 --> 07:07:59.740
and you have to identify it or something.

07:07:59.740 --> 07:08:02.460
Amazing rewards.

07:08:05.580 --> 07:08:06.820
Love that maze quest.

07:08:06.820 --> 07:08:07.660
Love it.

07:08:11.220 --> 07:08:13.460
Oh, it's going to skeal him.

07:08:15.460 --> 07:08:17.420
No, it's not getting him.

07:08:17.420 --> 07:08:18.340
Oh, I'm not too...

07:08:18.340 --> 07:08:19.180
Two songs.

07:08:22.140 --> 07:08:22.980
It's terrible.

07:08:22.980 --> 07:08:24.140
It's absolutely terrible.

07:08:30.740 --> 07:08:31.740
Oh, no.

07:08:32.740 --> 07:08:34.740
Our biggest enemy, a bridge.

07:08:34.740 --> 07:08:36.740
Right, we're going to go to the Grand Exchange

07:08:36.740 --> 07:08:38.220
to empty our inventory

07:08:38.220 --> 07:08:42.740
so we only have feathers and a fly fishing rod.

07:08:43.740 --> 07:08:44.740
I don't...

07:08:44.740 --> 07:08:45.740
There's a few fishers.

07:08:45.740 --> 07:08:47.740
I don't know if they're bots or not.

07:08:48.740 --> 07:08:51.740
As long as they're not talking,

07:08:51.740 --> 07:08:53.740
then I think we'll be safe.

07:08:53.740 --> 07:08:56.740
Because I don't want to turn off public traffic.

07:08:57.740 --> 07:08:59.740
Because I don't want to turn off public chat

07:08:59.740 --> 07:09:01.740
because it's fun having you guys talk

07:09:01.740 --> 07:09:03.740
both in-game and in-stream.

07:09:03.740 --> 07:09:05.740
It's where the real fishing begins.

07:09:05.740 --> 07:09:08.740
The seventh grade computer lab day fishing.

07:09:09.740 --> 07:09:10.740
Is it terrible?

07:09:10.740 --> 07:09:12.740
No one is going to argue she wasn't that one.

07:09:14.740 --> 07:09:17.740
Right, we're back at the Grand Exchange.

07:09:22.740 --> 07:09:25.740
Right, where's the reefling that has the rods we desire?

07:09:25.740 --> 07:09:28.740
For those reeflings who don't have a rod, please...

07:09:29.740 --> 07:09:31.740
Reach out to...

07:09:32.740 --> 07:09:33.740
To me.

07:09:33.740 --> 07:09:35.740
To Kamin 1000.

07:09:35.740 --> 07:09:37.740
If you don't have a rod...

07:09:37.740 --> 07:09:39.740
I don't know where Kamin is.

07:09:39.740 --> 07:09:40.740
I can't...

07:09:41.740 --> 07:09:43.740
Oh, there, here, here.

07:09:43.740 --> 07:09:44.740
There.

07:09:44.740 --> 07:09:47.740
The one in the smithing cape.

07:09:48.740 --> 07:09:51.740
If you don't have a fly fishing rod, trade then.

07:09:51.740 --> 07:09:53.740
I'm going to put my stuff in the bank.

07:09:53.740 --> 07:09:55.740
Uh, but...

07:09:55.740 --> 07:09:57.740
Uh, this is not enough.

07:09:59.740 --> 07:10:03.740
Let's just put everything in here other than...

07:10:03.740 --> 07:10:05.740
Like, all of these?

07:10:07.740 --> 07:10:08.740
Keep that...

07:10:08.740 --> 07:10:10.740
Wait, why have I not got the money?

07:10:11.740 --> 07:10:13.740
Oh no, I have a bear shield, that's why.

07:10:13.740 --> 07:10:15.740
And then put that away.

07:10:15.740 --> 07:10:16.740
And then put the fishing rod away.

07:10:16.740 --> 07:10:18.740
And then put the money away.

07:10:18.740 --> 07:10:20.740
Oh no, I didn't mean to click that.

07:10:20.740 --> 07:10:21.740
Okay.

07:10:21.740 --> 07:10:23.740
Okay, we did it.

07:10:23.740 --> 07:10:25.740
We're ready to fish and cook.

07:10:25.740 --> 07:10:27.740
Apparently everyone has a rod.

07:10:27.740 --> 07:10:28.740
Jeez.

07:10:29.740 --> 07:10:30.740
It must a...

07:10:30.740 --> 07:10:31.740
A rod?

07:10:32.740 --> 07:10:33.740
A fishing rod.

07:10:34.740 --> 07:10:35.740
It's the mighty of the strange.

07:10:35.740 --> 07:10:37.740
Old women in the forest isn't for...

07:10:37.740 --> 07:10:39.740
Oh, there's so many strange requests.

07:10:40.740 --> 07:10:42.740
Uh, I guess we're ready to take off

07:10:42.740 --> 07:10:44.740
if everyone's emptied their inventory

07:10:44.740 --> 07:10:46.740
and you should have a rod and feathers

07:10:46.740 --> 07:10:48.740
and then we are going to go fishing

07:10:48.740 --> 07:10:50.740
and level up our cooking eggs financially.

07:10:50.740 --> 07:10:51.740
I'm ready.

07:10:51.740 --> 07:10:55.740
All aboard the golden apron train.

07:10:56.740 --> 07:10:58.740
I'll just make sure in case someone's stuck

07:10:58.740 --> 07:10:59.740
at the bank right now.

07:10:59.740 --> 07:11:00.740
It's kind of hard to tell,

07:11:00.740 --> 07:11:01.740
because there's, like, somebody...

07:11:01.740 --> 07:11:02.740
Oh no, there's only...

07:11:03.740 --> 07:11:05.740
Rods are ready, everyone.

07:11:05.740 --> 07:11:07.740
So few female reeflings.

07:11:08.740 --> 07:11:09.740
And...

07:11:09.740 --> 07:11:11.740
It is what it is.

07:11:13.740 --> 07:11:14.740
Oh, wishes to trade with you?

07:11:14.740 --> 07:11:15.740
Okay.

07:11:15.740 --> 07:11:16.740
What's up?

07:11:17.740 --> 07:11:19.740
Are you giving me your...

07:11:19.740 --> 07:11:20.740
Are you giving me your banana?

07:11:20.740 --> 07:11:21.740
Oh, yeah.

07:11:24.740 --> 07:11:25.740
Wait, is this a thing?

07:11:26.740 --> 07:11:27.740
No, it's not.

07:11:27.740 --> 07:11:28.740
Okay.

07:11:28.740 --> 07:11:29.740
I've just been given the banana.

07:11:30.740 --> 07:11:31.740
Did you just finish?

07:11:31.740 --> 07:11:32.740
Be honest.

07:11:32.740 --> 07:11:33.740
Oh, I ate it.

07:11:33.740 --> 07:11:34.740
I'm sorry.

07:11:34.740 --> 07:11:35.740
I just ate it right in front of you.

07:11:35.740 --> 07:11:36.740
I'm sorry.

07:11:36.740 --> 07:11:37.740
I just ate your banana.

07:11:38.740 --> 07:11:39.740
Wait, is that everyone?

07:11:43.740 --> 07:11:45.740
Can I store it somewhere

07:11:45.740 --> 07:11:46.740
or just drop stuff off?

07:11:46.740 --> 07:11:47.740
Oh, yeah.

07:11:47.740 --> 07:11:50.740
So, do you see over here how it says

07:11:50.740 --> 07:11:52.740
bank banker?

07:11:53.740 --> 07:11:55.740
And then click on your inventory

07:11:55.740 --> 07:11:56.740
and it'll put it in the bank.

07:11:56.740 --> 07:11:58.740
So, this empties out your inventory.

07:11:58.740 --> 07:11:59.740
The only thing you want right now

07:11:59.740 --> 07:12:01.740
is a fly fishing rod and feathers.

07:12:02.740 --> 07:12:03.740
Banana or banana?

07:12:05.740 --> 07:12:07.740
It's a treat all over again.

07:12:07.740 --> 07:12:09.740
I actually had a lot of fun making that to me.

07:12:09.740 --> 07:12:10.740
I don't know what it's...

07:12:10.740 --> 07:12:13.740
I don't know if it's gotten more popular or not.

07:12:13.740 --> 07:12:15.740
But when I woke up, it was, like,

07:12:15.740 --> 07:12:16.740
1,000 likes and I'm like,

07:12:16.740 --> 07:12:18.740
ooh, that's a lot, I mean.

07:12:23.740 --> 07:12:25.740
Okay, that should hopefully be it.

07:12:27.740 --> 07:12:29.740
And then we'll take all the reeflings away.

07:12:29.740 --> 07:12:31.740
Actually, we'll...

07:12:31.740 --> 07:12:33.740
Well, I don't know if all the reeflings are ready yet.

07:12:34.740 --> 07:12:35.740
Thank you, God.

07:12:37.740 --> 07:12:41.740
She just ate that man's banana live on public.

07:12:41.740 --> 07:12:43.740
On stream in public in front of everyone.

07:12:44.740 --> 07:12:47.740
Okay, is that all reeflings?

07:12:47.740 --> 07:12:48.740
I like my name so...

07:12:48.740 --> 07:12:50.740
Oh, no, one more, one more.

07:12:51.740 --> 07:12:52.740
There's one more reefling.

07:12:54.740 --> 07:12:55.740
Look at that fit.

07:12:55.740 --> 07:12:57.740
Look at the feet size difference.

07:12:58.740 --> 07:13:00.740
Okay, we now follow

07:13:01.740 --> 07:13:03.740
the reeflings I thought was making a threat

07:13:03.740 --> 07:13:05.740
via the poison in fishfish.

07:13:08.740 --> 07:13:09.740
That video was good.

07:13:10.740 --> 07:13:14.740
Okay, reeflings, we're going to Barbarian Village.

07:13:14.740 --> 07:13:16.740
Hopefully there's no bots talking.

07:13:16.740 --> 07:13:18.740
I'm probably just gonna click ignore

07:13:18.740 --> 07:13:21.740
if there's any bots so we don't have to world hop

07:13:21.740 --> 07:13:23.740
because this is a pretty quiet world in general.

07:13:24.740 --> 07:13:25.740
Yeah, it was great.

07:13:25.740 --> 07:13:26.740
I lost that video.

07:13:27.740 --> 07:13:28.740
Really?

07:13:30.740 --> 07:13:33.740
I was, like, wondering should I, like, overcomplement...

07:13:33.740 --> 07:13:35.740
overcomplicate it and, like, say,

07:13:35.740 --> 07:13:36.740
like, certain words, phrase or whatever.

07:13:36.740 --> 07:13:37.740
And I was, like, no.

07:13:37.740 --> 07:13:39.740
Just be super simple about it.

07:13:39.740 --> 07:13:40.740
So I was...

07:13:42.740 --> 07:13:43.740
Did it.

07:13:45.740 --> 07:13:46.740
Right.

07:13:46.740 --> 07:13:50.740
Okay, so this is Barbarian fishing section.

07:13:50.740 --> 07:13:54.740
It's normally bought it, but I don't know.

07:13:54.740 --> 07:13:55.740
These may be real people.

07:13:55.740 --> 07:13:58.740
This is the best, like, free-to-play area.

07:13:58.740 --> 07:13:59.740
We'll do here.

07:13:59.740 --> 07:14:01.740
We'll lure our fishing rod.

07:14:03.740 --> 07:14:04.740
And how are you a cow?

07:14:04.740 --> 07:14:06.740
You were a bunny a second ago.

07:14:08.740 --> 07:14:10.740
Oh, I've already caught a fish.

07:14:11.740 --> 07:14:13.740
Whoa, the fishing is so fast.

07:14:15.740 --> 07:14:18.740
Oh, my God, really gonna be levelling up so quickly.

07:14:24.740 --> 07:14:26.740
Well, once whatever you catch,

07:14:26.740 --> 07:14:29.740
there's a pair of my fire over here that we can cook on.

07:14:30.740 --> 07:14:33.740
Everyone did get level 20 fishing, right?

07:14:33.740 --> 07:14:35.740
Or I've just dragged you over here for nothing.

07:14:37.740 --> 07:14:39.740
I hope everyone's...

07:14:42.740 --> 07:14:44.740
Oh, you're all up to 20?

07:14:51.740 --> 07:14:53.740
Oh, no, I thought everyone was 20 fishing.

07:14:53.740 --> 07:14:54.740
I'm so sorry.

07:14:56.740 --> 07:14:58.740
Oh, I'm not level 20.

07:14:58.740 --> 07:14:59.740
No.

07:15:02.740 --> 07:15:05.740
My suggestion, if you're not level 20,

07:15:05.740 --> 07:15:08.740
you need to get that net and go back to the thing.

07:15:08.740 --> 07:15:09.740
I joined late.

07:15:09.740 --> 07:15:11.740
I'll level in dreams night later.

07:15:13.740 --> 07:15:15.740
Not me, but I'll jump over and get a quick view of it.

07:15:17.740 --> 07:15:19.740
Oh, no, there's a banana on the floor.

07:15:19.740 --> 07:15:20.740
Random banana.

07:15:25.740 --> 07:15:28.740
So, only that video in your altar is one of the hottest.

07:15:28.740 --> 07:15:29.740
Oh.

07:15:32.740 --> 07:15:33.740
How many likes is that?

07:15:33.740 --> 07:15:35.740
I'm allowed to know.

07:15:36.740 --> 07:15:38.740
If you aren't level 20,

07:15:38.740 --> 07:15:42.740
I would suggest going back to Lumbridge.

07:15:42.740 --> 07:15:44.740
Teleport to Lumbridge.

07:15:44.740 --> 07:15:47.740
Get your small fishing net out the bank at the top

07:15:47.740 --> 07:15:50.740
and then go back to that spot until you're 20.

07:15:50.740 --> 07:15:52.740
And then coming here...

07:15:53.740 --> 07:15:54.740
Well, I'm already level 21.

07:15:54.740 --> 07:15:56.740
Jesus, so much faster doing this.

07:15:56.740 --> 07:15:57.740
It's crazy.

07:15:58.740 --> 07:15:59.740
Is that 1.4?

07:15:59.740 --> 07:16:00.740
Okay, we'll go.

07:16:01.740 --> 07:16:03.740
How long has people enjoyed it?

07:16:03.740 --> 07:16:04.740
That's the main thing.

07:16:08.740 --> 07:16:10.740
What level to bait fish here?

07:16:10.740 --> 07:16:12.740
I'm not sure.

07:16:12.740 --> 07:16:14.740
I only brought feathers for fly fish.

07:16:17.740 --> 07:16:18.740
No comment.

07:16:24.740 --> 07:16:26.740
Should I do a burp at the end of one of them?

07:16:26.740 --> 07:16:27.740
Maybe I should.

07:16:27.740 --> 07:16:28.740
They're like a burp version.

07:16:31.740 --> 07:16:32.740
Hmm.

07:16:34.740 --> 07:16:35.740
But yes.

07:16:36.740 --> 07:16:39.740
We're probably going to be here for like a hot second.

07:16:40.740 --> 07:16:43.740
Mercy's going up in an hour 40.

07:16:43.740 --> 07:16:45.740
So honestly, I think for the rest of the stream,

07:16:45.740 --> 07:16:46.740
we're going to be here.

07:16:46.740 --> 07:16:48.740
So if you want to level up to 20 cooking,

07:16:48.740 --> 07:16:50.740
you certainly can.

07:16:50.740 --> 07:16:52.740
Sorry, 20 fishing.

07:16:52.740 --> 07:16:54.740
And then like come back here.

07:16:54.740 --> 07:16:56.740
Like we'll probably most likely be here.

07:16:57.740 --> 07:17:02.740
And hopefully I can stop burning fish

07:17:02.740 --> 07:17:04.740
and then I can start burning through the supplies

07:17:04.740 --> 07:17:06.740
that were gifted because like I think I got like

07:17:06.740 --> 07:17:08.740
2000 fish gifted to me.

07:17:08.740 --> 07:17:09.740
I'll be back.

07:17:09.740 --> 07:17:10.740
Good luck.

07:17:10.740 --> 07:17:11.740
Yeah.

07:17:11.740 --> 07:17:12.740
Have a good time.

07:17:12.740 --> 07:17:15.740
You can teleport via your magic spells.

07:17:15.740 --> 07:17:17.740
Get on to, yeah.

07:17:17.740 --> 07:17:20.740
Get to Lumberge again and do that small thing

07:17:20.740 --> 07:17:23.740
and then come back here once you've got your fly fishing rod.

07:17:23.740 --> 07:17:25.740
And I've got loads of feathers on me.

07:17:26.740 --> 07:17:27.740
Yeah.

07:17:32.740 --> 07:17:34.740
This is where the ground begins.

07:17:34.740 --> 07:17:37.740
We are currently at 25 cooking.

07:17:37.740 --> 07:17:38.740
Which is decent.

07:17:38.740 --> 07:17:40.740
I wanted to get 40 before stream.

07:17:40.740 --> 07:17:43.740
I think 40 is part of that cow animation.

07:17:43.740 --> 07:17:47.740
I think 40 is 40 realistic before

07:17:47.740 --> 07:17:49.740
Mercy goes live.

07:17:49.740 --> 07:17:50.740
I'm not sure.

07:17:50.740 --> 07:17:51.740
I'm not sure.

07:17:51.740 --> 07:17:53.740
Bait fishing is 25.

07:17:53.740 --> 07:17:54.740
Oh, that's even worse.

07:17:54.740 --> 07:17:58.740
How do you get grapes, actually?

07:17:58.740 --> 07:18:00.740
From the Grand Exchange?

07:18:00.740 --> 07:18:03.740
I don't actually know where you harvest them.

07:18:07.740 --> 07:18:08.740
Tea time.

07:18:09.740 --> 07:18:11.740
We're actually going to get decent level in fishing.

07:18:11.740 --> 07:18:12.740
Yeah.

07:18:12.740 --> 07:18:13.740
Whoa.

07:18:13.740 --> 07:18:14.740
It's 50 eggs per fish.

07:18:14.740 --> 07:18:16.740
That's quite a lot.

07:18:16.740 --> 07:18:18.740
All things considered.

07:18:18.740 --> 07:18:21.740
I'm going to level up in fishing again

07:18:21.740 --> 07:18:23.740
on this one stalk of inland water.

07:18:25.740 --> 07:18:26.740
Yeah.

07:18:31.740 --> 07:18:34.740
Oh, that's a lot of trout on the floor.

07:18:34.740 --> 07:18:37.740
That's literally 10k worth of fish.

07:18:37.740 --> 07:18:41.740
13k XP per hour.

07:18:41.740 --> 07:18:42.740
If you don't cook the fish.

07:18:42.740 --> 07:18:44.740
Yeah, we're going to have to stop and use this fire.

07:18:44.740 --> 07:18:48.740
But this is a permanent fire that we can utilize for ourselves.

07:18:48.740 --> 07:18:50.740
Which is fantastic.

07:18:51.740 --> 07:18:53.740
Would it make sense to just buy them in bulk?

07:18:53.740 --> 07:18:56.740
Yeah, especially if you do that route and just buy 66.

07:18:56.740 --> 07:18:59.740
Oh, that would be daunting.

07:18:59.740 --> 07:19:02.740
But it's definitely a possibility.

07:19:08.740 --> 07:19:13.740
I'm wondering, maybe we could do react andy content.

07:19:15.740 --> 07:19:18.740
I don't know if there's stuff that's safe for YouTube reaction.

07:19:18.740 --> 07:19:20.740
Whilst we do this.

07:19:20.740 --> 07:19:22.740
Because don't get me wrong.

07:19:22.740 --> 07:19:23.740
I'm entertaining.

07:19:23.740 --> 07:19:28.740
But I don't think I'm that entertaining for like a 30 hour grind.

07:19:28.740 --> 07:19:30.740
If I was doing grapes.

07:19:32.740 --> 07:19:34.740
Oh, just do the last one.

07:19:35.740 --> 07:19:40.740
So maybe we put stuff on in the background.

07:19:42.740 --> 07:19:46.740
70 eggs pee for cooking trout.

07:19:46.740 --> 07:19:48.740
Whoa.

07:19:50.740 --> 07:19:52.740
That's so fast.

07:19:52.740 --> 07:19:55.740
We're literally 26 already.

07:19:56.740 --> 07:19:58.740
That is so fast.

07:19:58.740 --> 07:20:00.740
We need Minecraft parkour.

07:20:00.740 --> 07:20:03.740
Subway surfers in the bottom stream.

07:20:06.740 --> 07:20:08.740
70 is so much.

07:20:08.740 --> 07:20:11.740
When we unlock salmon, I don't even know how much salmon is.

07:20:11.740 --> 07:20:13.740
XP wise.

07:20:13.740 --> 07:20:15.740
Oh, stop burning it.

07:20:15.740 --> 07:20:17.740
Stop burning it.

07:20:21.740 --> 07:20:23.740
Oh.

07:20:29.740 --> 07:20:32.740
Just put some surfers in the corner.

07:20:36.740 --> 07:20:39.740
Yeah, so this is like free grinding as well.

07:20:39.740 --> 07:20:41.740
To pick up this fish that people drop.

07:20:43.740 --> 07:20:47.740
Oh, we literally went on two cooking levels doing one batch of fish.

07:20:47.740 --> 07:20:49.740
That's crazy.

07:20:51.740 --> 07:20:53.740
I'm so fast.

07:20:56.740 --> 07:20:58.740
Here, fishy fishy.

07:20:58.740 --> 07:21:00.740
We need to be quiet.

07:21:00.740 --> 07:21:02.740
Salmon or 90 cooking eggs pee.

07:21:02.740 --> 07:21:04.740
Okay, that will be good.

07:21:04.740 --> 07:21:07.740
I'll listen to you whenever, but I've lost my mind entirely.

07:21:07.740 --> 07:21:09.740
See you tomorrow. Rest well.

07:21:09.740 --> 07:21:11.740
Please rest well.

07:21:11.740 --> 07:21:13.740
Gotta get up tomorrow with Khan.

07:21:13.740 --> 07:21:15.740
Oh, fun time.

07:21:15.740 --> 07:21:17.740
Oh my god, it's Rinscape in real life.

07:21:18.740 --> 07:21:20.740
It's trying to get easily watched.

07:21:20.740 --> 07:21:22.740
There has been nothing but yapping.

07:21:22.740 --> 07:21:24.740
It's because of my voice.

07:21:24.740 --> 07:21:26.740
It's so sore.

07:21:26.740 --> 07:21:28.740
My face meant no dragon.

07:21:28.740 --> 07:21:30.740
Harpoon specking on free world.

07:21:30.740 --> 07:21:32.740
Oof.

07:21:38.740 --> 07:21:41.740
Wow, wow, wow.

07:21:41.740 --> 07:21:44.740
I haven't seen it for a while.

07:21:44.740 --> 07:21:46.740
Honestly, we...

07:21:46.740 --> 07:21:49.740
We thought we were going to do 40 before Mercy comes on,

07:21:49.740 --> 07:21:53.740
but we managed to like fish to high heaven.

07:21:53.740 --> 07:21:55.740
We might be past 40.

07:21:55.740 --> 07:21:57.740
I don't know. I don't want to jinx it, but...

07:21:57.740 --> 07:22:01.740
40 on the first Rinscape stream seems pretty decent work.

07:22:01.740 --> 07:22:03.740
And we also did fun questing.

07:22:06.740 --> 07:22:08.740
We got how many quests?

07:22:08.740 --> 07:22:10.740
One, two...

07:22:10.740 --> 07:22:12.740
I'm gonna go so fast.

07:22:12.740 --> 07:22:14.740
One, two...

07:22:14.740 --> 07:22:16.740
Three, four, five...

07:22:16.740 --> 07:22:18.740
Six and seven.

07:22:18.740 --> 07:22:20.740
Well, maybe do...

07:22:20.740 --> 07:22:22.740
A few more.

07:22:22.740 --> 07:22:24.740
23!

07:22:24.740 --> 07:22:27.740
Got overtime tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to...

07:22:27.740 --> 07:22:29.740
So I have plenty of listening time.

07:22:31.740 --> 07:22:33.740
For anyone that needs to go to sleep

07:22:33.740 --> 07:22:35.740
or you need to go do some things,

07:22:35.740 --> 07:22:37.740
please do not worry. You're not missing out on much.

07:22:37.740 --> 07:22:40.740
This is literally the gameplay for the next hour and a half.

07:22:40.740 --> 07:22:42.740
I'm not even kidding.

07:22:42.740 --> 07:22:44.740
We're just fishing and then a...

07:22:44.740 --> 07:22:46.740
We're catching the fish and then cooking them

07:22:46.740 --> 07:22:48.740
and then leveling up cooking.

07:22:48.740 --> 07:22:50.740
Are you squidding me right now?

07:22:50.740 --> 07:22:51.740
Brian!

07:22:55.740 --> 07:22:57.740
Hi Tiny Spinny!

07:22:57.740 --> 07:22:59.740
Hope you had fun at work.

07:22:59.740 --> 07:23:02.740
We are currently in World 3A

07:23:02.740 --> 07:23:05.740
and we are in Barbarian Village.

07:23:05.740 --> 07:23:07.740
We're fishing.

07:23:07.740 --> 07:23:09.740
So the Grand Exchange,

07:23:09.740 --> 07:23:11.740
Varrock, Telopore,

07:23:11.740 --> 07:23:13.740
and we're at the fishing village.

07:23:13.740 --> 07:23:15.740
We have a fly fishing rod

07:23:15.740 --> 07:23:17.740
and we have a feather

07:23:17.740 --> 07:23:19.740
and we're catching the fish and cooking them

07:23:19.740 --> 07:23:21.740
on the perma...

07:23:21.740 --> 07:23:23.740
cookie thing.

07:23:23.740 --> 07:23:25.740
Once I'm experienced enough

07:23:25.740 --> 07:23:27.740
not to burn fish,

07:23:27.740 --> 07:23:29.740
I most likely will cook all the fish

07:23:29.740 --> 07:23:31.740
that the reeflings gave me

07:23:31.740 --> 07:23:33.740
because I don't want them to go to waste

07:23:33.740 --> 07:23:35.740
because that was a lot of money

07:23:35.740 --> 07:23:37.740
that the reeflings handed me.

07:23:38.740 --> 07:23:40.740
I don't...

07:23:40.740 --> 07:23:41.740
I'll cook all of that

07:23:41.740 --> 07:23:42.740
and see where we are.

07:23:42.740 --> 07:23:44.740
I think lobsters...

07:23:44.740 --> 07:23:46.740
I've got quite a few lobsters.

07:23:46.740 --> 07:23:48.740
Trout, salmon, all of that.

07:23:48.740 --> 07:23:50.740
So we're going to cook all of that.

07:23:50.740 --> 07:23:53.740
I don't think we're going to be on Wains

07:23:53.740 --> 07:23:55.740
by the time Mercy comes on.

07:23:58.740 --> 07:24:01.740
I think tomorrow's my eighth more stream.

07:24:02.740 --> 07:24:04.740
So I definitely need to try and rest my voice

07:24:04.740 --> 07:24:06.740
so that it's going to be so smooth.

07:24:07.740 --> 07:24:09.740
I'm ready for another 2AM YAP session.

07:24:09.740 --> 07:24:11.740
We're listening to the Scottish last.

07:24:12.740 --> 07:24:13.740
I've got plenty of YAP

07:24:13.740 --> 07:24:14.740
and we're like, I'm slow.

07:24:14.740 --> 07:24:16.740
Oh, someone's got a mini...

07:24:17.740 --> 07:24:18.740
mini quest.

07:24:18.740 --> 07:24:19.740
A toot!

07:24:19.740 --> 07:24:21.740
A toot free power.

07:24:21.740 --> 07:24:22.740
A toot free power.

07:24:29.740 --> 07:24:30.740
Such a tent feeling free.

07:24:30.740 --> 07:24:31.740
Oh my God, it's so intense.

07:24:31.740 --> 07:24:33.740
Wait, I'm not even fishing anyone.

07:24:33.740 --> 07:24:35.740
That's probably the only thing that kills me

07:24:35.740 --> 07:24:36.740
about this game,

07:24:36.740 --> 07:24:38.740
like when it comes to fishing and stuff.

07:24:38.740 --> 07:24:40.740
It's when the boxes move.

07:24:42.740 --> 07:24:44.740
But it is very tempting to,

07:24:46.740 --> 07:24:48.740
like, pick up all the fish that are already here

07:24:48.740 --> 07:24:50.740
and just do that and spawn that.

07:24:50.740 --> 07:24:52.740
Lobsters require 40 cookies

07:24:52.740 --> 07:24:53.740
so it might be a while.

07:24:53.740 --> 07:24:54.740
I don't want to burn them.

07:24:55.740 --> 07:24:57.740
Here we are going to 4AM.

07:24:57.740 --> 07:24:58.740
I'm ready for...

07:24:59.740 --> 07:25:02.740
Yes, so if you want to join in

07:25:02.740 --> 07:25:03.740
some say hi.

07:25:03.740 --> 07:25:05.740
World 380

07:25:05.740 --> 07:25:07.740
and Barbarian Village Fishing Sport.

07:25:07.740 --> 07:25:08.740
Free to play.

07:25:08.740 --> 07:25:09.740
Free to play.

07:25:09.740 --> 07:25:11.740
Well, cheeky free to play.

07:25:12.740 --> 07:25:15.740
If I get the RuneScape...

07:25:16.740 --> 07:25:19.740
If I do end up getting the Cookin' Cape,

07:25:19.740 --> 07:25:20.740
we might take a break

07:25:20.740 --> 07:25:22.740
but I wouldn't mind doing membership quests

07:25:22.740 --> 07:25:23.740
at some point

07:25:23.740 --> 07:25:25.740
because I've never actually done them

07:25:25.740 --> 07:25:26.740
and I'm too scared to do them on my own

07:25:26.740 --> 07:25:27.740
but if you guys are with me,

07:25:27.740 --> 07:25:28.740
I'm not scared.

07:25:29.740 --> 07:25:32.740
Yes, I think tomorrow's ASMR stream

07:25:32.740 --> 07:25:35.740
and then day after is trying sweet.

07:25:37.740 --> 07:25:39.740
And then after is Skyrim

07:25:39.740 --> 07:25:40.740
and I get to rant...

07:25:40.740 --> 07:25:41.740
No, not rant, sorry.

07:25:41.740 --> 07:25:45.740
I get to mumble away about Skyrim for ages.

07:25:46.740 --> 07:25:49.740
Lobsters have a 60% chance to burn at level 40.

07:25:49.740 --> 07:25:51.740
Yeah, I'm not wasting Lobsters there.

07:25:52.740 --> 07:25:54.740
That is rough.

07:25:54.740 --> 07:25:55.740
That's rough.

07:25:56.740 --> 07:25:58.740
I don't want to waste a lot of weight

07:25:58.740 --> 07:26:00.740
because that was so much better rather than...

07:26:00.740 --> 07:26:03.740
But we're like leveling up our fishing so easily.

07:26:05.740 --> 07:26:07.740
Right, we are full.

07:26:07.740 --> 07:26:09.740
Let's see, can we get two levels out of this

07:26:09.740 --> 07:26:10.740
if we don't burn them?

07:26:10.740 --> 07:26:12.740
It burns the first one.

07:26:15.740 --> 07:26:16.740
Dude, waterfall fires.

07:26:16.740 --> 07:26:18.740
It gets you to combat level 30.

07:26:18.740 --> 07:26:19.740
What?

07:26:19.740 --> 07:26:20.740
Really?

07:26:21.740 --> 07:26:22.740
I know I got some quests

07:26:22.740 --> 07:26:24.740
really give you a lot of XP

07:26:24.740 --> 07:26:26.740
but I can't wait for those more

07:26:26.740 --> 07:26:27.740
but I'm lucky for the time.

07:26:27.740 --> 07:26:29.740
Maybe I'll cast a bit later.

07:26:33.740 --> 07:26:35.740
Don't worry if you can't make it to any stream.

07:26:35.740 --> 07:26:36.740
I think the boss will stay up

07:26:36.740 --> 07:26:39.740
and I'm not going to be doing ear licking

07:26:39.740 --> 07:26:42.740
because something weird is going on with YouTube.

07:26:43.740 --> 07:26:45.740
It's going on a little weird with YouTube

07:26:45.740 --> 07:26:46.740
and I don't know what's going on

07:26:46.740 --> 07:26:48.740
so I'm not risking it.

07:26:49.740 --> 07:26:52.740
As I gave you all those lobs

07:26:52.740 --> 07:26:54.740
you can burn them if you need to.

07:26:56.740 --> 07:26:58.740
I'd rather not waste the XP

07:26:58.740 --> 07:27:00.740
like if it was potential full XP

07:27:00.740 --> 07:27:03.740
like it's okay to burn these trout for example.

07:27:05.740 --> 07:27:07.740
Oh come on, one more and I'll level up.

07:27:07.740 --> 07:27:08.740
Okay, there we go.

07:27:09.740 --> 07:27:10.740
20.

07:27:10.740 --> 07:27:11.740
Aw yeah.

07:27:12.740 --> 07:27:14.740
I want 40 before Mercy comes online.

07:27:14.740 --> 07:27:16.740
We're under the cock roof limbs.

07:27:18.740 --> 07:27:19.740
We're under the cock.

07:27:20.740 --> 07:27:21.740
Empty inventory.

07:27:21.740 --> 07:27:22.740
Let's get it.

07:27:22.740 --> 07:27:23.740
I don't know if I should fish

07:27:23.740 --> 07:27:25.740
or if I should honestly

07:27:25.740 --> 07:27:27.740
just put my stuff away and pick up

07:27:27.740 --> 07:27:28.740
but if everyone was picking up

07:27:28.740 --> 07:27:29.740
what was put on the floor

07:27:29.740 --> 07:27:32.740
then we wouldn't have enough trout to go around.

07:27:38.740 --> 07:27:40.740
Where would be the first ASMR?

07:27:40.740 --> 07:27:42.740
Hopefully YouTube will get off.

07:27:44.740 --> 07:27:46.740
No, it's like cracking down everywhere

07:27:46.740 --> 07:27:48.740
on anime ASMR in particular.

07:27:48.740 --> 07:27:51.740
If you want to call it anime ASMR.

07:27:53.740 --> 07:27:55.740
It'll be faster to loot the fish

07:27:55.740 --> 07:27:57.740
if you just want to do a cooking.

07:27:57.740 --> 07:27:59.740
That's what I'm thinking.

07:28:00.740 --> 07:28:02.740
If I just do that instead.

07:28:06.740 --> 07:28:08.740
It's nice to get the level of XP

07:28:08.740 --> 07:28:11.740
but I'm gonna like blast the head of you reeflings

07:28:11.740 --> 07:28:12.740
if I do that.

07:28:12.740 --> 07:28:14.740
Would you guys be upset if I picked up trout?

07:28:15.740 --> 07:28:16.740
Hopefully not.

07:28:17.740 --> 07:28:19.740
It would blast me forward though.

07:28:19.740 --> 07:28:21.740
Like, compared to everyone's level.

07:28:27.740 --> 07:28:28.740
Go for it.

07:28:31.740 --> 07:28:32.740
What do I need?

07:28:32.740 --> 07:28:33.740
I just need trout.

07:28:33.740 --> 07:28:34.740
I can't cook salmon

07:28:34.740 --> 07:28:35.740
because I'm too low level.

07:28:35.740 --> 07:28:37.740
Wait, examine?

07:28:38.740 --> 07:28:40.740
No, I don't want salmon.

07:28:40.740 --> 07:28:41.740
I can't cook it.

07:28:42.740 --> 07:28:43.740
I want trout.

07:28:44.740 --> 07:28:45.740
Right.

07:28:45.740 --> 07:28:47.740
We'll see how far this gets me ahead

07:28:47.740 --> 07:28:49.740
if I do this method where I don't fish.

07:28:49.740 --> 07:28:52.740
Maybe you guys can drop the fish for me

07:28:52.740 --> 07:28:54.740
and we get fish train going.

07:28:54.740 --> 07:28:55.740
There's two more.

07:28:56.740 --> 07:28:57.740
Right, let's cook this batch.

07:28:57.740 --> 07:28:59.740
Let's see what happens.

07:28:59.740 --> 07:29:01.740
I like fish.

07:29:01.740 --> 07:29:03.740
The fish are so amazing too.

07:29:06.740 --> 07:29:08.740
Basically, if you can't see what they're actually doing

07:29:08.740 --> 07:29:09.740
they're assuming it's like,

07:29:09.740 --> 07:29:11.740
Yes, I think that's what the problem is.

07:29:11.740 --> 07:29:12.740
Why?

07:29:12.740 --> 07:29:13.740
In real life it's fine,

07:29:13.740 --> 07:29:15.740
but anime's getting wapped with it.

07:29:17.740 --> 07:29:18.740
I say anime,

07:29:18.740 --> 07:29:19.740
beach over animation.

07:29:19.740 --> 07:29:20.740
You know what I mean.

07:29:21.740 --> 07:29:23.740
Anyway, it starts blasting.

07:29:25.740 --> 07:29:27.740
We're fish slaves, let's go.

07:29:28.740 --> 07:29:30.740
Sounds a bit fishy, but okay.

07:29:37.740 --> 07:29:38.740
Are we gonna make it?

07:29:38.740 --> 07:29:39.740
I think we are.

07:29:40.740 --> 07:29:41.740
I said this.

07:29:43.740 --> 07:29:45.740
No idea when I said that.

07:29:48.740 --> 07:29:49.740
29 already?

07:29:49.740 --> 07:29:51.740
Oh my god, this is so fast.

07:29:51.740 --> 07:29:53.740
I'm saying it's fast now

07:29:53.740 --> 07:29:55.740
because it's gonna be so slow later,

07:29:55.740 --> 07:29:56.740
but I'm happy.

07:29:57.740 --> 07:30:00.740
I only burnt four from that batch as well.

07:30:00.740 --> 07:30:04.740
That trout is getting cooked to perfection by me, honestly.

07:30:05.740 --> 07:30:07.740
I see trout, I see trout.

07:30:10.740 --> 07:30:12.740
I don't know, those are cooked trout.

07:30:13.740 --> 07:30:15.740
Right, I'm gonna have to fish and go fish.

07:30:15.740 --> 07:30:17.740
Oh wait, someone wants to trade with me, hold on.

07:30:21.740 --> 07:30:23.740
You'll never guess what.

07:30:23.740 --> 07:30:24.740
It's trout.

07:30:28.740 --> 07:30:29.740
Oh no, you cancelled.

07:30:29.740 --> 07:30:31.740
Oh, you don't have enough inspiratory space.

07:30:31.740 --> 07:30:32.740
Oh no, sorry.

07:30:33.740 --> 07:30:35.740
I don't know how many I've got left.

07:30:35.740 --> 07:30:36.740
Like,

07:30:37.740 --> 07:30:39.740
space for freaking...

07:30:39.740 --> 07:30:40.740
Yeah.

07:30:42.740 --> 07:30:44.740
Trade modified.

07:30:44.740 --> 07:30:45.740
Blink, blink, blink.

07:30:45.740 --> 07:30:47.740
I saw serious, literally.

07:30:47.740 --> 07:30:48.740
I don't know if that's too much.

07:30:48.740 --> 07:30:49.740
Oh no.

07:30:49.740 --> 07:30:50.740
Is it?

07:30:50.740 --> 07:30:51.740
Oh, you failed me.

07:30:51.740 --> 07:30:52.740
Oh, my inventory.

07:30:52.740 --> 07:30:53.740
You failed my inventory.

07:30:53.740 --> 07:30:55.740
Thank you, beef knife.

07:31:01.740 --> 07:31:02.740
That's terrible.

07:31:02.740 --> 07:31:04.740
But thank you very much, we've blown.

07:31:04.740 --> 07:31:06.740
It's running out of here playing cooking, mummy.

07:31:06.740 --> 07:31:07.740
Literally, I'm feeding.

07:31:07.740 --> 07:31:11.740
You don't get 100% success on trout until 49.

07:31:11.740 --> 07:31:12.740
That's so rough.

07:31:12.740 --> 07:31:14.740
I don't remember it being so like that.

07:31:26.740 --> 07:31:28.740
We're already gonna level up again.

07:31:30.740 --> 07:31:32.740
I don't know when we unlock being able to cook salmon,

07:31:32.740 --> 07:31:33.740
but it's gonna be soon.

07:31:33.740 --> 07:31:36.740
Gonna drop all the trout in the south spot of salmon here.

07:31:36.740 --> 07:31:37.740
Yeah.

07:31:37.740 --> 07:31:39.740
If you don't overlap on the salmon,

07:31:39.740 --> 07:31:41.740
it makes it so easy to pick up.

07:31:41.740 --> 07:31:43.740
Wow, we're already up there.

07:31:43.740 --> 07:31:44.740
Oh my god.

07:31:44.740 --> 07:31:46.740
Are we gonna be 50 by the time mercy?

07:31:48.740 --> 07:31:50.740
We may, honestly.

07:31:53.740 --> 07:31:55.740
I'm cooking by gas.

07:31:55.740 --> 07:31:57.740
I'm cooking the best I can.

07:31:57.740 --> 07:31:59.740
Okay, we had like way more burnt in that batch,

07:31:59.740 --> 07:32:01.740
so it really is just randomized.

07:32:02.740 --> 07:32:04.740
Let's empty our inventory,

07:32:04.740 --> 07:32:06.740
and then let's grab all these trout.

07:32:13.740 --> 07:32:15.740
I'm over there, hating.

07:32:15.740 --> 07:32:17.740
Oh wait, sorry.

07:32:19.740 --> 07:32:21.740
I don't know if you have to take into account

07:32:21.740 --> 07:32:24.740
how much inventory space I have.

07:32:27.740 --> 07:32:28.740
Okay.

07:32:28.740 --> 07:32:29.740
Yeah.

07:32:29.740 --> 07:32:32.740
As long as you put whatever inventory.

07:32:38.740 --> 07:32:41.740
Oh my god.

07:32:41.740 --> 07:32:43.740
Loves yourself six percent.

07:32:45.740 --> 07:32:48.740
The key to power leveling is slave teamwork.

07:32:48.740 --> 07:32:51.740
Honestly, we're doing pretty good.

07:32:52.740 --> 07:32:55.740
We're already launching the 30s.

07:32:56.740 --> 07:33:00.740
I think we can fly past the 40s, honestly.

07:33:00.740 --> 07:33:01.740
Hi, Stronia.

07:33:01.740 --> 07:33:02.740
Been away from us today.

07:33:02.740 --> 07:33:04.740
How's it going?

07:33:04.740 --> 07:33:08.740
We have done some quests, some free play quests.

07:33:08.740 --> 07:33:11.740
We are currently at Barbarian Village,

07:33:11.740 --> 07:33:15.740
and I'm currently using the reflames

07:33:15.740 --> 07:33:17.740
to slave fish for me,

07:33:17.740 --> 07:33:18.740
so we're getting trout,

07:33:18.740 --> 07:33:22.740
and I'm currently leveling up like crazy right now.

07:33:23.740 --> 07:33:26.740
Every batch of trout is making me go up another level.

07:33:26.740 --> 07:33:28.740
I'm already 31 cooking.

07:33:30.740 --> 07:33:34.740
We're messing around, having fun on quests.

07:33:34.740 --> 07:33:36.740
And now I'm just doing...

07:33:36.740 --> 07:33:38.740
I'm actually tempted to go to the Grand Exchange to...

07:33:38.740 --> 07:33:40.740
Oh, sorry, I'm pressing the wrong button.

07:33:40.740 --> 07:33:43.740
I'm tempted to go to the Grand Exchange

07:33:43.740 --> 07:33:46.740
to drop the fish and rod off,

07:33:46.740 --> 07:33:49.740
just to do full inventories as well.

07:33:49.740 --> 07:33:50.740
I think I may.

07:33:50.740 --> 07:33:52.740
I'm going to be right back, reflames, okay?

07:33:52.740 --> 07:33:56.740
I'm going to drop the feathers and the fish and rod away,

07:33:56.740 --> 07:33:57.740
that you guys can stay.

07:33:57.740 --> 07:33:59.740
Don't worry, don't get separation anxiety.

07:33:59.740 --> 07:34:00.740
I'll be right back.

07:34:00.740 --> 07:34:03.740
Mummy's going to the Grand Exchange and back again.

07:34:03.740 --> 07:34:04.740
You'll be okay.

07:34:04.740 --> 07:34:06.740
It's fine.

07:34:06.740 --> 07:34:08.740
Mummy will be right back.

07:34:08.740 --> 07:34:09.740
See, I'm across the water.

07:34:09.740 --> 07:34:10.740
Bye-bye.

07:34:10.740 --> 07:34:11.740
I'll be right back.

07:34:13.740 --> 07:34:14.740
Literally.

07:34:14.740 --> 07:34:16.740
All right, I just need to drop this off

07:34:16.740 --> 07:34:18.740
so I can have full...

07:34:18.740 --> 07:34:19.740
No, not the book.

07:34:19.740 --> 07:34:20.740
Not the booth.

07:34:20.740 --> 07:34:21.740
I want the bank.

07:34:21.740 --> 07:34:23.740
I'm trying to see if I can do it through the ceiling.

07:34:23.740 --> 07:34:24.740
I can't.

07:34:26.740 --> 07:34:27.740
She's never coming back.

07:34:27.740 --> 07:34:28.740
I'm coming back.

07:34:28.740 --> 07:34:30.740
I just need to bank the banker.

07:34:32.740 --> 07:34:33.740
There, there, there.

07:34:33.740 --> 07:34:34.740
See, look, empty.

07:34:34.740 --> 07:34:35.740
Look, I'm already running back.

07:34:35.740 --> 07:34:36.740
I'm running out of stamina.

07:34:36.740 --> 07:34:37.740
It's okay.

07:34:37.740 --> 07:34:38.740
I'm a wee bit tired.

07:34:38.740 --> 07:34:39.740
I'm getting a wee bit tired.

07:34:39.740 --> 07:34:40.740
45.

07:34:40.740 --> 07:34:41.740
Stamina.

07:34:42.740 --> 07:34:43.740
Wah, wah, wah.

07:34:44.740 --> 07:34:45.740
I'm coming back.

07:34:45.740 --> 07:34:46.740
I'm coming back.

07:34:47.740 --> 07:34:48.740
We're orphans!

07:34:48.740 --> 07:34:49.740
No!

07:34:51.740 --> 07:34:52.740
You can't be, you can't be, you can't be.

07:34:52.740 --> 07:34:53.740
See, look, look, look, I'm back.

07:34:53.740 --> 07:34:54.740
Look, who's that?

07:34:54.740 --> 07:34:55.740
Who's that?

07:34:55.740 --> 07:34:56.740
That's right.

07:34:56.740 --> 07:34:57.740
I'm on the other side of the water.

07:34:57.740 --> 07:34:58.740
Boom.

07:34:58.740 --> 07:34:59.740
I'm coming to pick up that trout

07:34:59.740 --> 07:35:00.740
that's on the floor there

07:35:00.740 --> 07:35:01.740
because there's tons.

07:35:01.740 --> 07:35:03.740
Oh, the renaissance of the fire as well.

07:35:05.740 --> 07:35:07.740
See, we have no home.

07:35:07.740 --> 07:35:09.740
See, look, I'm literally right here.

07:35:10.740 --> 07:35:12.740
Is there so dramatic?

07:35:12.740 --> 07:35:14.740
See, of all the trout.

07:35:15.740 --> 07:35:18.740
I'm max leveling up.

07:35:18.740 --> 07:35:21.740
I'm going to pick up all the ones on the floor.

07:35:21.740 --> 07:35:23.740
It's better to drop the trout.

07:35:23.740 --> 07:35:25.740
It's faster to drop it.

07:35:26.740 --> 07:35:29.740
Who dares the spots picking up?

07:35:29.740 --> 07:35:30.740
It's faster to drop the trout

07:35:30.740 --> 07:35:32.740
than it is to trade me.

07:35:32.740 --> 07:35:34.740
Right, okay, full inventory.

07:35:36.740 --> 07:35:39.740
We're going to be in the 50s after this.

07:35:39.740 --> 07:35:41.740
There's no way we're not.

07:35:42.740 --> 07:35:45.740
What were you doing with all those people

07:35:45.740 --> 07:35:47.740
in the business room?

07:35:47.740 --> 07:35:49.740
Dropping trout.

07:35:49.740 --> 07:35:51.740
Trout.

07:35:51.740 --> 07:35:53.740
Oh, pardon me.

07:35:53.740 --> 07:35:55.740
Trout.

07:35:55.740 --> 07:35:56.740
Trout.

07:35:56.740 --> 07:35:58.740
The fish.

07:35:58.740 --> 07:35:59.740
Trout.

07:35:59.740 --> 07:36:00.740
Trout.

07:36:00.740 --> 07:36:02.740
You don't need to see the sea

07:36:02.740 --> 07:36:03.740
at the end.

07:36:03.740 --> 07:36:04.740
Dropping trout.

07:36:05.740 --> 07:36:07.740
There's loads of words that I say like that.

07:36:07.740 --> 07:36:09.740
I can't believe it.

07:36:10.740 --> 07:36:13.740
Check your XP per hour on the bar.

07:36:17.740 --> 07:36:19.740
Why is it not displaying?

07:36:20.740 --> 07:36:21.740
This is I'm cooking.

07:36:21.740 --> 07:36:24.740
Cooked 92, 93 per hour burn.

07:36:24.740 --> 07:36:26.740
23% burn rate.

07:36:26.740 --> 07:36:28.740
Why is it not displaying?

07:36:28.740 --> 07:36:30.740
I'm cooking though.

07:36:31.740 --> 07:36:33.740
It's not like telling me.

07:36:33.740 --> 07:36:34.740
Literally level 20.

07:36:34.740 --> 07:36:36.740
It's not like telling me.

07:36:39.740 --> 07:36:40.740
Hmm.

07:36:43.740 --> 07:36:44.740
Trout.

07:36:44.740 --> 07:36:46.740
It's short for trousers.

07:36:49.740 --> 07:36:50.740
Oh, this one.

07:36:50.740 --> 07:36:52.740
Oh, now we're talking.

07:36:52.740 --> 07:36:53.740
Hold on.

07:36:53.740 --> 07:36:55.740
Let me drop all these.

07:36:56.740 --> 07:36:59.740
It says for not fishing.

07:36:59.740 --> 07:37:00.740
Cooking.

07:37:00.740 --> 07:37:01.740
Where is cooking?

07:37:01.740 --> 07:37:03.740
Where's cooking?

07:37:04.740 --> 07:37:05.740
Here.

07:37:05.740 --> 07:37:06.740
Cooking's purple.

07:37:06.740 --> 07:37:08.740
Why would it be purple honestly?

07:37:09.740 --> 07:37:10.740
Let me grab all these trout.

07:37:10.740 --> 07:37:12.740
There's like so much on the floor honestly.

07:37:14.740 --> 07:37:15.740
I can't keep up.

07:37:15.740 --> 07:37:16.740
There's so much.

07:37:19.740 --> 07:37:24.740
It says I'm gaining 2,000 XP per hour.

07:37:26.740 --> 07:37:27.740
Oh, there's trout here.

07:37:27.740 --> 07:37:28.740
Trout, trout, trout.

07:37:29.740 --> 07:37:30.740
No, the trout.

07:37:30.740 --> 07:37:31.740
Not the fire.

07:37:32.740 --> 07:37:34.740
Now I've got to fill inventory.

07:37:36.740 --> 07:37:37.740
Let's see.

07:37:38.740 --> 07:37:41.740
XP gained 16 hour, roughly 2k,

07:37:41.740 --> 07:37:43.740
but it's probably going to go up for a bit

07:37:43.740 --> 07:37:46.740
because I'm not being done fill trout and XP left.

07:37:47.740 --> 07:37:50.740
Oh no, it's getting covered up by the freaking layer.

07:37:55.740 --> 07:37:56.740
I'm coming back in.

07:37:56.740 --> 07:37:58.740
We're at Barbarian Village

07:37:58.740 --> 07:38:00.740
at the free play fishing spot.

07:38:02.740 --> 07:38:04.740
But I think we're definitely higher.

07:38:04.740 --> 07:38:06.740
Yeah, this is going up.

07:38:06.740 --> 07:38:08.740
It says we're now 2.3 per hour.

07:38:08.740 --> 07:38:10.740
It's because we've not done it for an hour, but...

07:38:11.740 --> 07:38:12.740
Once we have...

07:38:12.740 --> 07:38:13.740
It says...

07:38:13.740 --> 07:38:15.740
Actually, I don't know if you can see that.

07:38:16.740 --> 07:38:17.740
Of course not.

07:38:17.740 --> 07:38:20.740
It literally says like six actions left

07:38:20.740 --> 07:38:23.740
and then we've leveled up, so that's really good.

07:38:23.740 --> 07:38:24.740
I like that.

07:38:24.740 --> 07:38:26.740
It kind of puts into perspective

07:38:26.740 --> 07:38:28.740
how much you need to do in order to get next.

07:38:28.740 --> 07:38:29.740
Next.

07:38:33.740 --> 07:38:35.740
You can write...

07:38:35.740 --> 07:38:37.740
Literally level 33.

07:38:38.740 --> 07:38:40.740
You can reset.

07:38:41.740 --> 07:38:42.740
I'll just leave that.

07:38:44.740 --> 07:38:45.740
That's the only burnt two.

07:38:45.740 --> 07:38:47.740
Oh, burnt three that time.

07:38:51.740 --> 07:38:53.740
They don't burn three that time.

07:38:54.740 --> 07:38:56.740
I'm so MLG pro.

07:38:59.740 --> 07:39:02.740
Oh, I shouldn't maybe drop the trout here.

07:39:06.740 --> 07:39:08.740
I don't know when I can start cooking salmon,

07:39:08.740 --> 07:39:10.740
but it should be sent to you.

07:39:15.740 --> 07:39:17.740
She needs that raw fish meat.

07:39:17.740 --> 07:39:19.740
Are you treating me fish?

07:39:21.740 --> 07:39:23.740
Oh no, I don't have inventory for that.

07:39:23.740 --> 07:39:24.740
Is that tuna?

07:39:24.740 --> 07:39:26.740
I'm pretty sure that's tuna.

07:39:26.740 --> 07:39:27.740
Sorry, I don't have any...

07:39:27.740 --> 07:39:29.740
Oh, you're giving me three tuna?

07:39:29.740 --> 07:39:33.740
I don't even think I'm like leveling enough to do that.

07:39:33.740 --> 07:39:34.740
What are you?

07:39:34.740 --> 07:39:36.740
Use tuna on the fire.

07:39:36.740 --> 07:39:37.740
Oh, I can.

07:39:37.740 --> 07:39:38.740
Oh, it's not tuna.

07:39:38.740 --> 07:39:39.740
Oh, what is it?

07:39:39.740 --> 07:39:40.740
It's tuna.

07:39:41.740 --> 07:39:42.740
Oh, burnt it.

07:39:43.740 --> 07:39:45.740
It's 100 XP.

07:39:45.740 --> 07:39:47.740
Wait, that's more XP than salmon.

07:39:51.740 --> 07:39:52.740
Okay.

07:39:53.740 --> 07:39:54.740
Reset.

07:39:54.740 --> 07:39:55.740
It seems to have bugged out.

07:39:55.740 --> 07:39:56.740
Okay, I'll reset.

07:39:56.740 --> 07:39:58.740
Sorry, reset.

07:40:00.740 --> 07:40:01.740
Oh, I know it's not the bomb.

07:40:01.740 --> 07:40:03.740
Oh, you can actually see it though, no?

07:40:04.740 --> 07:40:06.740
Tuna max and right now,

07:40:06.740 --> 07:40:07.740
Manstronia just really...

07:40:07.740 --> 07:40:11.740
That you and my definition of fun are completely different.

07:40:11.740 --> 07:40:14.740
I mean, I'm literally becoming a little chef.

07:40:14.740 --> 07:40:17.740
I'm able to feed all the reeflings like this now.

07:40:20.740 --> 07:40:22.740
Oh, she'll be getting all the thingies.

07:40:22.740 --> 07:40:24.740
Oh, it says I have nine actions left.

07:40:24.740 --> 07:40:25.740
That's so cool.

07:40:25.740 --> 07:40:28.740
That says like you literally have a number.

07:40:28.740 --> 07:40:30.740
Because soon it will be like 100 left

07:40:30.740 --> 07:40:31.740
and then it'll be 1000 left

07:40:31.740 --> 07:40:33.740
and I'll be like, that's fine.

07:40:34.740 --> 07:40:36.740
Her numbers are going way up.

07:40:36.740 --> 07:40:38.740
Literally, this is like...

07:40:38.740 --> 07:40:42.740
If you like slow incremental games that feel satisfying,

07:40:42.740 --> 07:40:45.740
RuneScape is definitely for you.

07:40:45.740 --> 07:40:48.740
I've never 99 something

07:40:48.740 --> 07:40:50.740
and I want to do it

07:40:50.740 --> 07:40:53.740
and you guys can hold me accountable for it.

07:40:53.740 --> 07:40:55.740
I'll literally tuna max and so whatever.

07:40:55.740 --> 07:40:56.740
Who's got trout up for me?

07:40:56.740 --> 07:40:57.740
No, that's cooked trout.

07:40:57.740 --> 07:40:59.740
That's raw trout, okay.

07:40:59.740 --> 07:41:01.740
Oh wait, is this accept trade?

07:41:01.740 --> 07:41:02.740
Do you got more tuna?

07:41:02.740 --> 07:41:04.740
It's the tuna man.

07:41:05.740 --> 07:41:06.740
Of course, it's fun.

07:41:06.740 --> 07:41:07.740
Numbers goes up.

07:41:07.740 --> 07:41:09.740
Don't for me and we all get literally...

07:41:10.740 --> 07:41:13.740
Wow, thank you so much for the tuna.

07:41:13.740 --> 07:41:15.740
How is everyone today?

07:41:15.740 --> 07:41:16.740
Someone asks.

07:41:17.740 --> 07:41:19.740
We're...

07:41:19.740 --> 07:41:21.740
We're tuna max...

07:41:21.740 --> 07:41:22.740
No, not tuna.

07:41:22.740 --> 07:41:24.740
Oh, I was talking.

07:41:24.740 --> 07:41:25.740
I was taking...

07:41:25.740 --> 07:41:26.740
Are you squiddin' me right now?

07:41:26.740 --> 07:41:27.740
Brian!

07:41:27.740 --> 07:41:29.740
We love when numbers go up,

07:41:29.740 --> 07:41:31.740
so have some numbers.

07:41:31.740 --> 07:41:34.740
Oh, money's different.

07:41:34.740 --> 07:41:37.740
Thank you for the tip, don't do that.

07:41:37.740 --> 07:41:39.740
We do love money going up

07:41:39.740 --> 07:41:41.740
in incremental video games.

07:41:43.740 --> 07:41:46.740
We're playing Cooking Sim

07:41:46.740 --> 07:41:48.740
and it's amazing.

07:41:48.740 --> 07:41:50.740
Hope...

07:41:50.740 --> 07:41:52.740
Hope your day is going well.

07:41:52.740 --> 07:41:54.740
Smile if you see.

07:41:54.740 --> 07:41:56.740
Always be nice to people.

07:41:57.740 --> 07:42:00.740
I am burning the absolute living

07:42:00.740 --> 07:42:01.740
daylights out of this tuna.

07:42:01.740 --> 07:42:02.740
I'm so sorry.

07:42:02.740 --> 07:42:04.740
I've just wasted all that tuna.

07:42:06.740 --> 07:42:07.740
So sorry.

07:42:09.740 --> 07:42:11.740
I have been here for like four hours.

07:42:13.740 --> 07:42:15.740
Oh, I keep messing it up.

07:42:15.740 --> 07:42:16.740
I wonder if you could sell cooked tuna

07:42:16.740 --> 07:42:17.740
for decent money.

07:42:17.740 --> 07:42:19.740
I don't think it's a cheap fish.

07:42:19.740 --> 07:42:21.740
I seem to think like...

07:42:21.740 --> 07:42:23.740
Alright, raw trout time.

07:42:26.740 --> 07:42:28.740
Uh, fishing levels?

07:42:28.740 --> 07:42:30.740
Uh, um...

07:42:30.740 --> 07:42:32.740
Anya?

07:42:32.740 --> 07:42:33.740
What the fuck?

07:42:33.740 --> 07:42:34.740
Runescape message saying

07:42:34.740 --> 07:42:35.740
I'm going to be logged in

07:42:35.740 --> 07:42:36.740
in 30 minutes, max six hours play.

07:42:36.740 --> 07:42:38.740
Wait, is that real?

07:42:38.740 --> 07:42:40.740
Wait, you got more tuna already?

07:42:40.740 --> 07:42:42.740
Wait, you can't have.

07:42:43.740 --> 07:42:45.740
How are you doing?

07:42:47.740 --> 07:42:48.740
Are you peddling tuna to me

07:42:48.740 --> 07:42:50.740
to level me up faster?

07:42:50.740 --> 07:42:51.740
I feel like I'm wasting all your

07:42:51.740 --> 07:42:52.740
tuna.

07:42:54.740 --> 07:42:55.740
Oh, no.

07:42:57.740 --> 07:42:59.740
Wait, are we finally doing it?

07:42:59.740 --> 07:43:00.740
Are we...

07:43:00.740 --> 07:43:02.740
Are we got tuna slave runners?

07:43:04.740 --> 07:43:06.740
Yeah, it's like there was log is real.

07:43:06.740 --> 07:43:07.740
Wait, am I going to be booted out

07:43:07.740 --> 07:43:09.740
or because I bought membership

07:43:09.740 --> 07:43:11.740
I'm not going to be booted out.

07:43:11.740 --> 07:43:13.740
I have plenty of tuna.

07:43:13.740 --> 07:43:15.740
I could literally buy a million.

07:43:17.740 --> 07:43:18.740
Hey, Strony.

07:43:18.740 --> 07:43:20.740
Am I in trouble for cooking

07:43:20.740 --> 07:43:21.740
my own food tonight?

07:43:21.740 --> 07:43:22.740
Does that mean I could just jump

07:43:22.740 --> 07:43:23.740
into the kitchen?

07:43:23.740 --> 07:43:25.740
You're allowed to make it.

07:43:27.740 --> 07:43:28.740
He...

07:43:28.740 --> 07:43:29.740
That is messed up.

07:43:29.740 --> 07:43:30.740
I'm not a child.

07:43:30.740 --> 07:43:31.740
Literally why is the game

07:43:31.740 --> 07:43:33.740
doing it for like bandwidth issues?

07:43:33.740 --> 07:43:35.740
If you're a free member,

07:43:35.740 --> 07:43:37.740
they're like, oh, we've had enough of you.

07:43:37.740 --> 07:43:39.740
Strony becomes a master chef

07:43:39.740 --> 07:43:40.740
but can't fight a rat.

07:43:40.740 --> 07:43:42.740
No, it was the cow that was going to

07:43:42.740 --> 07:43:43.740
kill me.

07:43:43.740 --> 07:43:44.740
It was a baby cow.

07:43:46.740 --> 07:43:48.740
And you just log in right back after.

07:43:50.740 --> 07:43:51.740
That's bizarre.

07:43:51.740 --> 07:43:52.740
No, my...

07:43:52.740 --> 07:43:53.740
What?

07:43:54.740 --> 07:43:56.740
Well, it says we've been up for seven

07:43:56.740 --> 07:43:58.740
hours or is it because I got logged out

07:43:58.740 --> 07:44:00.740
when I went away for like a cup of tea

07:44:00.740 --> 07:44:01.740
and that?

07:44:01.740 --> 07:44:02.740
I wonder if that's why.

07:44:03.740 --> 07:44:04.740
Hold on.

07:44:05.740 --> 07:44:06.740
Is tuna max...

07:44:06.740 --> 07:44:08.740
Is tuna max through there?

07:44:10.740 --> 07:44:11.740
I've got Buddha at one point.

07:44:11.740 --> 07:44:13.740
Yeah, you've just been DCing a lot.

07:44:13.740 --> 07:44:15.740
Okay, every time I go for Tinkle Winkle,

07:44:15.740 --> 07:44:17.740
I've been DCed so it doesn't count.

07:44:18.740 --> 07:44:19.740
How much do you care about doing

07:44:19.740 --> 07:44:20.740
the proper way?

07:44:20.740 --> 07:44:23.740
I think I'm supposed to do wine next.

07:44:23.740 --> 07:44:24.740
Someone says, hi, Emmy.

07:44:24.740 --> 07:44:26.740
Is the Emmy imposter here?

07:44:27.740 --> 07:44:29.740
Where's the Emmy imposter?

07:44:33.740 --> 07:44:34.740
Oh, there it is.

07:44:34.740 --> 07:44:38.740
You changed your name to Emmy Bizoon Game.

07:44:38.740 --> 07:44:39.740
Level 113.

07:44:39.740 --> 07:44:41.740
That's a big account, honestly.

07:44:42.740 --> 07:44:44.740
Okay, let me grab this.

07:44:47.740 --> 07:44:48.740
Emmy's...

07:44:48.740 --> 07:44:50.740
Emmy's a RuneScape nerd.

07:44:52.740 --> 07:44:54.740
No, it's not the real Emmers,

07:44:54.740 --> 07:44:55.740
but someone likes her,

07:44:55.740 --> 07:44:58.740
so I'm glad someone enjoys her as much to do that.

07:44:59.740 --> 07:45:01.740
Emmy the Goal, honestly.

07:45:01.740 --> 07:45:02.740
What's the fit on Emmy?

07:45:02.740 --> 07:45:04.740
Oh, they changed her hair to look like

07:45:04.740 --> 07:45:06.740
her pumpkins and everything.

07:45:06.740 --> 07:45:08.740
And give her a skirt.

07:45:08.740 --> 07:45:10.740
That's supposed to be her blue shorts.

07:45:10.740 --> 07:45:12.740
Okay, okay, okay.

07:45:13.740 --> 07:45:15.740
Let him get up, let him get up.

07:45:15.740 --> 07:45:16.740
Where is that?

07:45:17.740 --> 07:45:19.740
We're already level 35.

07:45:20.740 --> 07:45:22.740
We should've came here, like, from the beginning.

07:45:22.740 --> 07:45:25.740
We wouldn't even have had to do anything.

07:45:27.740 --> 07:45:30.740
Yeah, and that baby cow has been caught in front of a king.

07:45:32.740 --> 07:45:34.740
Hydration check.

07:45:34.740 --> 07:45:36.740
I'm actually running out of water.

07:45:39.740 --> 07:45:41.740
What's mercy, one hour?

07:45:46.740 --> 07:45:47.740
Wah.

07:45:48.740 --> 07:45:50.740
It gives me, like, relief drink and water

07:45:50.740 --> 07:45:51.740
for a millisecond,

07:45:51.740 --> 07:45:54.740
and then I feel the pain of talking again.

07:45:55.740 --> 07:45:57.740
Let's do this raw trip.

07:45:58.740 --> 07:45:59.740
Raw trip.

07:46:00.740 --> 07:46:01.740
Oh, sorry.

07:46:01.740 --> 07:46:03.740
I keep forgetting Mr. Tuna Man.

07:46:03.740 --> 07:46:04.740
Sorry, guys.

07:46:05.740 --> 07:46:07.740
I got, like, three space.

07:46:10.740 --> 07:46:12.740
That tuna man going ham.

07:46:12.740 --> 07:46:14.740
Oh my God, that's so much money.

07:46:15.740 --> 07:46:17.740
Absolutely nothing.

07:46:17.740 --> 07:46:19.740
And then the value on your side

07:46:19.740 --> 07:46:21.740
is just, like, losing horrifically.

07:46:25.740 --> 07:46:27.740
I can do one more inventory,

07:46:27.740 --> 07:46:29.740
and then I have to do some rune crafting

07:46:29.740 --> 07:46:30.740
for my clan skull.

07:46:30.740 --> 07:46:31.740
Okay, thank you so much.

07:46:31.740 --> 07:46:32.740
Excuse me, ma'am.

07:46:32.740 --> 07:46:35.740
We had to level up to 20 fishing to start fishing here.

07:46:35.740 --> 07:46:40.740
Yes, you have to go back to the Castello.

07:46:40.740 --> 07:46:41.740
Good luck.

07:46:41.740 --> 07:46:42.740
Thank you so much for the...

07:46:42.740 --> 07:46:44.740
Thanks for all the fish.

07:46:44.740 --> 07:46:47.740
I'm pretty sure that is the ending to a movie

07:46:47.740 --> 07:46:50.740
that Bilbo was in that I haven't watched yet.

07:46:52.740 --> 07:46:53.740
I can't remember.

07:46:53.740 --> 07:46:55.740
But it goes thanks for all the fish.

07:46:55.740 --> 07:46:57.740
Level 36.

07:46:58.740 --> 07:46:59.740
Oh my God.

07:46:59.740 --> 07:47:02.740
The tuna, literally a hundred of pop as well, is crazy.

07:47:04.740 --> 07:47:06.740
He keeps in the bunny soup girl

07:47:06.740 --> 07:47:07.740
turning into a guy.

07:47:07.740 --> 07:47:08.740
Oh, never mind.

07:47:10.740 --> 07:47:12.740
It's because they're dancing on each other.

07:47:12.740 --> 07:47:13.740
Hitchhiker's guide.

07:47:13.740 --> 07:47:15.740
Yes, I've not seen that.

07:47:16.740 --> 07:47:17.740
Good Lord, you're still alive?

07:47:17.740 --> 07:47:19.740
Yeah, we're tuna maxing.

07:47:19.740 --> 07:47:21.740
We're currently level 36.

07:47:22.740 --> 07:47:24.740
And cooking is that purple one right there.

07:47:25.740 --> 07:47:26.740
Here.

07:47:26.740 --> 07:47:28.740
We're level 36.

07:47:28.740 --> 07:47:30.740
Apparently your egg steeper hour is like

07:47:30.740 --> 07:47:32.740
freaking 56K with the tuna.

07:47:32.740 --> 07:47:34.740
It's like going up like crazy.

07:47:41.740 --> 07:47:42.740
So much tuna.

07:47:44.740 --> 07:47:45.740
You know what's really nice?

07:47:45.740 --> 07:47:46.740
Tuna, cucumber, meal.

07:47:48.740 --> 07:47:50.740
Like uncrusted bread.

07:47:50.740 --> 07:47:51.740
Oh, no, no, no.

07:47:51.740 --> 07:47:52.740
It's delicious.

07:47:59.740 --> 07:48:01.740
Can we cook raw salmon yet?

07:48:01.740 --> 07:48:02.740
Let me check.

07:48:02.740 --> 07:48:04.740
Use the salmon on the fire.

07:48:05.740 --> 07:48:07.740
What's everyone's opinion on anchovy pizza?

07:48:07.740 --> 07:48:08.740
Oh, I can cook salmon.

07:48:08.740 --> 07:48:09.740
Okay.

07:48:09.740 --> 07:48:11.740
I can pick up salmon now as well.

07:48:11.740 --> 07:48:12.740
Right.

07:48:12.740 --> 07:48:14.740
I'll pick up salmon and trout so I can just like do it all.

07:48:15.740 --> 07:48:18.740
Level 50 is about 100K egg fee total.

07:48:20.740 --> 07:48:22.740
What's my total egg fee?

07:48:24.740 --> 07:48:26.740
I am one fourth of the way to level 50.

07:48:26.740 --> 07:48:29.740
I'm not sure I can do it before Maryse goes online.

07:48:30.740 --> 07:48:32.740
Oh, I'll be cutting it close, I think.

07:48:33.740 --> 07:48:34.740
Oh, no, I can't.

07:48:34.740 --> 07:48:35.740
I would have to be tuna maxing.

07:48:35.740 --> 07:48:38.740
Unless the salmon does it, I'm not sure.

07:48:39.740 --> 07:48:41.740
Unless the salmon does it.

07:48:43.740 --> 07:48:46.740
And if I stop burning everything.

07:48:48.740 --> 07:48:50.740
I'm scooping up all this trout.

07:48:50.740 --> 07:48:52.740
I'm scooping it up.

07:48:52.740 --> 07:48:54.740
My inventory is getting so full.

07:48:56.740 --> 07:48:58.740
Someone's got a mini cliff.

07:48:59.740 --> 07:49:01.740
No, but that is huge.

07:49:03.740 --> 07:49:06.740
It's so fast with the salmon as well.

07:49:08.740 --> 07:49:11.740
Oh, five more salmon and then level up again.

07:49:13.740 --> 07:49:15.740
Oh, come on, you can do it.

07:49:15.740 --> 07:49:16.740
Two more.

07:49:16.740 --> 07:49:17.740
One more.

07:49:18.740 --> 07:49:19.740
Yes!

07:49:20.740 --> 07:49:21.740
30 freaking six.

07:49:22.740 --> 07:49:23.740
37, sorry.

07:49:23.740 --> 07:49:24.740
I know numbers sometimes.

07:49:25.740 --> 07:49:28.740
Oh, we are tuna maxing.

07:49:28.740 --> 07:49:31.740
We are fish maxing out the wazoo right now.

07:49:33.740 --> 07:49:34.740
Stronny.

07:49:34.740 --> 07:49:35.740
You can do it, Stronny.

07:49:35.740 --> 07:49:37.740
Cook this, Galea's base starts late.

07:49:37.740 --> 07:49:39.740
There's neither motor.

07:49:40.740 --> 07:49:41.740
There's neither motor.

07:49:41.740 --> 07:49:42.740
There's neither motor.

07:49:42.740 --> 07:49:44.740
There's neither motor.

07:49:45.740 --> 07:49:48.740
We're going to do it, we're going to do it.

07:49:50.740 --> 07:49:53.740
Tuna is more XP than salmon.

07:49:53.740 --> 07:49:55.740
Salmon's more XP than trout.

07:49:56.740 --> 07:49:59.740
But unfortunately I'm still at the burning stage,

07:49:59.740 --> 07:50:02.740
so I'm not maximising my inventory right now.

07:50:04.740 --> 07:50:07.740
I don't think there's any other quests that give cooking XP

07:50:07.740 --> 07:50:09.740
that I know of other than...

07:50:09.740 --> 07:50:11.740
There's probably a ton of members' quests

07:50:11.740 --> 07:50:14.740
that do have, like, cooking XP.

07:50:16.740 --> 07:50:19.740
But as it stands right now,

07:50:20.740 --> 07:50:22.740
we'll do full inventory of raw trout.

07:50:24.740 --> 07:50:27.740
But once we start, once we stop burning,

07:50:27.740 --> 07:50:31.740
then we can do, like, max inventory XP gains,

07:50:31.740 --> 07:50:34.740
which is really handy down there.

07:50:35.740 --> 07:50:36.740
Who took that little bit sound?

07:50:36.740 --> 07:50:38.740
Who taking my trout?

07:50:38.740 --> 07:50:39.740
You need my trout.

07:50:41.740 --> 07:50:43.740
Salmon might honestly be better rates

07:50:43.740 --> 07:50:45.740
when you factor in the burn rate.

07:50:45.740 --> 07:50:46.740
Mmm.

07:50:46.740 --> 07:50:48.740
It's possible.

07:50:48.740 --> 07:50:51.740
Someone else here is, like, snatching up the salmon,

07:50:51.740 --> 07:50:52.740
which is fine.

07:50:52.740 --> 07:50:54.740
Honestly, it's not like the trout is, like,

07:50:54.740 --> 07:50:56.740
bad or anything.

07:50:57.740 --> 07:50:59.740
I know we'll make it to 40.

07:50:59.740 --> 07:51:01.740
The question is how far in?

07:51:03.740 --> 07:51:05.740
True mummy gamey here, honestly.

07:51:05.740 --> 07:51:07.740
Click simulator.

07:51:07.740 --> 07:51:09.740
But it's so good though!

07:51:09.740 --> 07:51:11.740
Oh, like, RuneScape is so nostalgic.

07:51:19.740 --> 07:51:22.740
Look, it's like, I love how the Rune plug-in,

07:51:22.740 --> 07:51:24.740
or whatever it's called, RuneLight,

07:51:24.740 --> 07:51:26.740
literally absolutely annihilating out here.

07:51:27.740 --> 07:51:32.740
Salmon's success rate at 38 is 74%.

07:51:32.740 --> 07:51:35.740
Mmm, that's not bad.

07:51:35.740 --> 07:51:37.740
Everyone in four?

07:51:40.740 --> 07:51:41.740
Everyone in four.

07:51:41.740 --> 07:51:43.740
Okay, who has the XL spreadsheet?

07:51:43.740 --> 07:51:45.740
An optimal fish cookin'.

07:51:46.740 --> 07:51:49.740
The best member's quest for it is the family crest,

07:51:49.740 --> 07:51:51.740
so you get gloves that would just burn it.

07:51:51.740 --> 07:51:54.740
Oh, I've never done, I don't know what that is actually.

07:51:56.740 --> 07:51:58.740
It sounds difficult though,

07:51:58.740 --> 07:52:01.740
because for something to be such a good item,

07:52:01.740 --> 07:52:03.740
I feel like they would have put it behind,

07:52:03.740 --> 07:52:05.740
like, really difficult quests.

07:52:06.740 --> 07:52:08.740
Oh, if I can pick up a few of these salmon,

07:52:08.740 --> 07:52:09.740
I'll make the photos.

07:52:12.740 --> 07:52:14.740
RuneLight is insane.

07:52:14.740 --> 07:52:16.740
I can never play with a vanilla client again.

07:52:18.740 --> 07:52:19.740
Get mugged.

07:52:21.740 --> 07:52:23.740
I suppose if you want, like, super nostalgic,

07:52:23.740 --> 07:52:24.740
just leave it as is.

07:52:24.740 --> 07:52:26.740
Right, we'll do the trout first,

07:52:26.740 --> 07:52:28.740
because I want, like, I don't want to

07:52:28.740 --> 07:52:30.740
have higher rate of burning the salmon,

07:52:30.740 --> 07:52:32.740
since it offers more.

07:52:33.740 --> 07:52:35.740
Do you just stream forever, strong?

07:52:35.740 --> 07:52:37.740
I just really enjoy streaming,

07:52:37.740 --> 07:52:39.740
and I like hanging out with refunds,

07:52:39.740 --> 07:52:41.740
especially on days where we get to play a multiplayer game,

07:52:41.740 --> 07:52:43.740
where we get to be together.

07:52:43.740 --> 07:52:45.740
I really like that.

07:52:46.740 --> 07:52:49.740
I'm actually going off a bit earlier than expected.

07:52:49.740 --> 07:52:51.740
When Mercy comes online in an hour,

07:52:51.740 --> 07:52:53.740
I'm raiding into her.

07:52:53.740 --> 07:52:56.740
And the only reason I'm not doing an endurance today,

07:52:56.740 --> 07:53:00.740
hmm, is because my voice is very sore,

07:53:00.740 --> 07:53:02.740
and I have an ASMR stream tomorrow,

07:53:02.740 --> 07:53:05.740
so I'm gonna have to try and rest it a bit better

07:53:05.740 --> 07:53:09.740
than usual, than the usual

07:53:11.740 --> 07:53:13.740
when a game is this old.

07:53:16.740 --> 07:53:18.740
Yes, if my voice wasn't sore,

07:53:18.740 --> 07:53:20.740
I unironically just do 12 hours again.

07:53:20.740 --> 07:53:21.740
I'm sorry.

07:53:21.740 --> 07:53:22.740
I would. I said it.

07:53:22.740 --> 07:53:24.740
I said what we're all thinking.

07:53:24.740 --> 07:53:25.740
You all know what...

07:53:25.740 --> 07:53:27.740
Oh no, I didn't cook those raw salmon.

07:53:27.740 --> 07:53:29.740
Silly Billy.

07:53:29.740 --> 07:53:31.740
Oh no, it's giving me the actual salmon.

07:53:31.740 --> 07:53:33.740
Ah, oh well.

07:53:33.740 --> 07:53:35.740
I'm not salmon maxing.

07:53:35.740 --> 07:53:37.740
I'm not a real salmon max, so I can't believe it.

07:53:37.740 --> 07:53:40.740
I'm sorry you had to all find out this way.

07:53:40.740 --> 07:53:42.740
Let's do a try.

07:53:43.740 --> 07:53:44.740
We're doing...

07:53:44.740 --> 07:53:45.740
We're getting pretty good at try.

07:53:45.740 --> 07:53:47.740
We're getting pretty good.

07:53:47.740 --> 07:53:49.740
Over eight hours not endurance.

07:53:49.740 --> 07:53:50.740
Come on now.

07:53:50.740 --> 07:53:52.740
I don't know, I feel like...

07:53:52.740 --> 07:53:54.740
You know when you have like a regular nine to five job?

07:53:54.740 --> 07:53:57.740
Like, obviously I had quite a few.

07:53:58.740 --> 07:54:00.740
And I just put it in perspective.

07:54:00.740 --> 07:54:02.740
Like, I'm literally memeing about on a video game.

07:54:02.740 --> 07:54:06.740
I get to like play and like have fun times with you.

07:54:06.740 --> 07:54:08.740
And it just like...

07:54:08.740 --> 07:54:09.740
Oh my god, wait.

07:54:09.740 --> 07:54:10.740
Is this Trinna Man back?

07:54:10.740 --> 07:54:12.740
Hold on, is Trinna Man back?

07:54:12.740 --> 07:54:14.740
Trinna, I thought you had to go do some things

07:54:14.740 --> 07:54:16.740
with your clan or something.

07:54:16.740 --> 07:54:18.740
Oh my god, we're Trinna Maxing again.

07:54:18.740 --> 07:54:19.740
Oh!

07:54:19.740 --> 07:54:20.740
Half a million?

07:54:20.740 --> 07:54:21.740
Are you sure?

07:54:21.740 --> 07:54:23.740
I mean, I ain't gonna say no.

07:54:23.740 --> 07:54:25.740
How are you all so rich?

07:54:27.740 --> 07:54:28.740
Where are you...

07:54:28.740 --> 07:54:30.740
What are you doing to make money in RuneScape?

07:54:30.740 --> 07:54:34.740
What are the ways to buy some good fish with it?

07:54:34.740 --> 07:54:35.740
Thank you, Reefling.

07:54:35.740 --> 07:54:37.740
Oh my gosh, when the time comes.

07:54:37.740 --> 07:54:39.740
Yes, when I don't burn stuff.

07:54:39.740 --> 07:54:40.740
How...

07:54:40.740 --> 07:54:43.740
I have three billion on an Iron Man account.

07:54:43.740 --> 07:54:45.740
How do you make money in RuneScape?

07:54:45.740 --> 07:54:46.740
Seriously?

07:54:47.740 --> 07:54:48.740
Trinna Man!

07:54:48.740 --> 07:54:49.740
How?

07:54:52.740 --> 07:54:53.740
How do you make money on RuneScape?

07:54:53.740 --> 07:54:54.740
I don't know how.

07:54:54.740 --> 07:54:57.740
I'm gonna put this money in the bank so I'm not full.

07:54:58.740 --> 07:55:01.740
The more you play, the higher stats you get raised.

07:55:01.740 --> 07:55:02.740
Strawni get...

07:55:02.740 --> 07:55:05.740
get hella high level so we can do raids.

07:55:06.740 --> 07:55:07.740
Oh!

07:55:07.740 --> 07:55:09.740
What's raiding?

07:55:11.740 --> 07:55:13.740
Oh, you guys teach me how to raid.

07:55:13.740 --> 07:55:17.740
International Bank of Strawni, honestly though.

07:55:19.740 --> 07:55:22.740
Oh, I wanted to get a pet that looked like you guys as well.

07:55:22.740 --> 07:55:23.740
That was another goal.

07:55:23.740 --> 07:55:24.740
So 99...

07:55:24.740 --> 07:55:25.740
Um...

07:55:27.740 --> 07:55:30.740
99, um...

07:55:30.740 --> 07:55:31.740
Cookin'.

07:55:31.740 --> 07:55:33.740
And then I want to get a pet that looks like you guys.

07:55:33.740 --> 07:55:35.740
But I don't know how the pets work.

07:55:35.740 --> 07:55:37.740
Golly, double neck.

07:55:37.740 --> 07:55:38.740
Okay.

07:55:38.740 --> 07:55:40.740
I'm gonna go put this in the bank.

07:55:40.740 --> 07:55:41.740
No, VC.

07:55:42.740 --> 07:55:44.740
Math wants to choose.

07:55:44.740 --> 07:55:46.740
Math, I don't have much inventory.

07:55:46.740 --> 07:55:47.740
I'm sorry.

07:55:48.740 --> 07:55:51.740
Oh yeah, give me them...

07:55:51.740 --> 07:55:52.740
Sardines?

07:55:52.740 --> 07:55:53.740
You giving me...

07:55:53.740 --> 07:55:54.740
Oh!

07:55:54.740 --> 07:55:57.740
Oh yeah, we got pike ladies and gentlemen.

07:55:57.740 --> 07:55:58.740
Get that cooked.

07:55:58.740 --> 07:56:00.740
Get that cooked on that fire thing.

07:56:00.740 --> 07:56:01.740
Thank you.

07:56:01.740 --> 07:56:02.740
Get that cooked.

07:56:03.740 --> 07:56:05.740
Oh, it made me 39!

07:56:05.740 --> 07:56:07.740
Economic Dragon Bitter.

07:56:09.740 --> 07:56:12.740
Not to be confused with the German word bitter,

07:56:12.740 --> 07:56:15.740
which means please, I think.

07:56:15.740 --> 07:56:17.740
Bitter?

07:56:17.740 --> 07:56:18.740
No.

07:56:18.740 --> 07:56:21.740
I don't think that's what that means in German.

07:56:22.740 --> 07:56:23.740
Hee-hee-hee.

07:56:23.740 --> 07:56:25.740
Also high level drops peaking.

07:56:25.740 --> 07:56:26.740
No, I couldn't do peaking.

07:56:26.740 --> 07:56:27.740
Oh, I'm coming back.

07:56:27.740 --> 07:56:29.740
Don't worry, Reeflings, I'm coming back.

07:56:29.740 --> 07:56:31.740
Mummy's putting the money in the bank.

07:56:31.740 --> 07:56:32.740
I'm coming back, okay?

07:56:32.740 --> 07:56:35.740
Mummy needs to pay rent, so I'm putting it in the bank.

07:56:35.740 --> 07:56:38.740
We need to rent that location out for only us.

07:56:38.740 --> 07:56:40.740
Bitter means please, okay?

07:56:40.740 --> 07:56:42.740
No, Reeflings, don't cry, I'm coming back.

07:56:42.740 --> 07:56:44.740
Sorry, I forgot to say that, I needed to go.

07:56:44.740 --> 07:56:46.740
I'm putting this in the bank, okay?

07:56:46.740 --> 07:56:47.740
Look, bank.

07:56:48.740 --> 07:56:49.740
And look at that.

07:56:49.740 --> 07:56:50.740
We're max.

07:56:50.740 --> 07:56:52.740
Look how much fish we've got.

07:56:52.740 --> 07:56:54.740
200 raw ship.

07:56:54.740 --> 07:56:57.740
600 salmon.

07:56:57.740 --> 07:56:59.740
450 swordfish.

07:56:59.740 --> 07:57:01.740
500 lobster's raw tuna.

07:57:01.740 --> 07:57:02.740
Like, there's so much.

07:57:02.740 --> 07:57:04.740
I don't want to burn any of this, though.

07:57:05.740 --> 07:57:07.740
Bitter means you are welcome.

07:57:07.740 --> 07:57:08.740
Oh, Dankeschon.

07:57:08.740 --> 07:57:09.740
Bitter.

07:57:09.740 --> 07:57:10.740
Okay, there we go.

07:57:10.740 --> 07:57:12.740
There's a sentence that you could use in.

07:57:12.740 --> 07:57:14.740
Oh, no, Dankeschon?

07:57:14.740 --> 07:57:16.740
Or Dankeschon?

07:57:16.740 --> 07:57:18.740
No, I think it has a kh.

07:57:19.740 --> 07:57:21.740
Don't worry, Reeflings, I'm coming back.

07:57:21.740 --> 07:57:23.740
Look, see, I'm coming, I'm coming.

07:57:23.740 --> 07:57:25.740
Look, look, look, you're gonna render again.

07:57:25.740 --> 07:57:26.740
Yay, Reeflings!

07:57:26.740 --> 07:57:28.740
All the Reeflings are here.

07:57:29.740 --> 07:57:31.740
You've got money to burn all that fish.

07:57:31.740 --> 07:57:33.740
You're loaded, holy.

07:57:33.740 --> 07:57:35.740
Literally, a Reefling gave me 10 million.

07:57:35.740 --> 07:57:36.740
Another gave me a million.

07:57:36.740 --> 07:57:38.740
One just gave me half a million there.

07:57:38.740 --> 07:57:40.740
But I don't want to waste it.

07:57:40.740 --> 07:57:42.740
I don't want to waste the money.

07:57:44.740 --> 07:57:47.740
Oh, sorry, sorry, I accept.

07:57:47.740 --> 07:57:49.740
Sorry, I'm fish-maxing, okay?

07:57:49.740 --> 07:57:50.740
Where's Mommy?

07:57:50.740 --> 07:57:52.740
Mommy's back, Mommy's back.

07:57:54.740 --> 07:57:56.740
How much XP do you get for this?

07:57:56.740 --> 07:57:58.740
I didn't even know you could fish it here.

07:58:00.740 --> 07:58:02.740
Can't believe someone went...

07:58:03.740 --> 07:58:04.740
What?

07:58:04.740 --> 07:58:06.740
I can't believe someone went more dry

07:58:06.740 --> 07:58:08.740
than I did on a dragonfish.

07:58:09.740 --> 07:58:10.740
How much did we get?

07:58:10.740 --> 07:58:12.740
Oh, we got A.A. for these?

07:58:12.740 --> 07:58:14.740
These are the same as mine?

07:58:15.740 --> 07:58:17.740
We cease to exist when you leave us.

07:58:17.740 --> 07:58:19.740
No!

07:58:19.740 --> 07:58:20.740
Reeflings!

07:58:20.740 --> 07:58:22.740
Bitter means a bunch of things, including both.

07:58:22.740 --> 07:58:23.740
Okay.

07:58:25.740 --> 07:58:27.740
My German knowledge is expanding.

07:58:29.740 --> 07:58:31.740
I know to expand

07:58:32.740 --> 07:58:34.740
my Puerto Rican knowledge.

07:58:35.740 --> 07:58:37.740
That's all you get.

07:58:37.740 --> 07:58:38.740
Okay.

07:58:43.740 --> 07:58:45.740
I don't know how many pets I got.

07:58:45.740 --> 07:58:47.740
Can you own all the pets that won?

07:58:48.740 --> 07:58:50.740
Oh, they're like little symbols to show what won.

07:58:50.740 --> 07:58:52.740
There's 24 pets!

07:58:54.740 --> 07:58:55.740
What?

07:58:55.740 --> 07:58:56.740
How?

07:59:00.740 --> 07:59:01.740
How's there 24?

07:59:01.740 --> 07:59:03.740
There are 59 pets?

07:59:04.740 --> 07:59:05.740
What?

07:59:06.740 --> 07:59:08.740
That's a lot.

07:59:09.740 --> 07:59:11.740
Yeah, especially now because I have a

07:59:11.740 --> 07:59:13.740
chain made in a void worker jam.

07:59:13.740 --> 07:59:15.740
Is that how you attract pets to you?

07:59:15.740 --> 07:59:16.740
You wear jewelry?

07:59:17.740 --> 07:59:18.740
They're like, ooh, shiny.

07:59:18.740 --> 07:59:20.740
Is there a magpie pet?

07:59:23.740 --> 07:59:25.740
What have we got?

07:59:25.740 --> 07:59:27.740
Oh, actually, I've picked the place clean.

07:59:27.740 --> 07:59:29.740
That's how much I'm fish-maxing.

07:59:29.740 --> 07:59:30.740
There's nothing on the ground.

07:59:30.740 --> 07:59:31.740
I've picked it clean.

07:59:31.740 --> 07:59:32.740
Oh, wait.

07:59:32.740 --> 07:59:33.740
There's a trade.

07:59:33.740 --> 07:59:34.740
Ah!

07:59:34.740 --> 07:59:35.740
I'm missing.

07:59:36.740 --> 07:59:37.740
A rubbish aimbot.

07:59:37.740 --> 07:59:38.740
Whoa, yeah.

07:59:38.740 --> 07:59:39.740
17.

07:59:39.740 --> 07:59:40.740
39.

07:59:41.740 --> 07:59:42.740
All salmon.

07:59:42.740 --> 07:59:44.740
We're all in on salmon.

07:59:44.740 --> 07:59:46.740
Salmon cook and run.

07:59:46.740 --> 07:59:48.740
We're almost level 40.

07:59:48.740 --> 07:59:50.740
40's like a melody and...

07:59:51.740 --> 07:59:52.740
Oh, sorry.

07:59:52.740 --> 07:59:53.740
I just punched them.

07:59:53.740 --> 07:59:54.740
I can hear that.

07:59:54.740 --> 07:59:56.740
There's a little anime there.

07:59:58.740 --> 07:59:59.740
Stronti only just starts streaming.

07:59:59.740 --> 08:00:01.740
She's already a 1% earner in this game.

08:00:01.740 --> 08:00:02.740
Wait, really?

08:00:02.740 --> 08:00:05.740
Is level 40 a 1% thing?

08:00:05.740 --> 08:00:08.740
Like, hardly anyone gets to 40 in something?

08:00:10.740 --> 08:00:12.740
Shorty's like a melody and...

08:00:13.740 --> 08:00:14.740
I can't keep growl.

08:00:14.740 --> 08:00:15.740
Got me singing like...

08:00:16.740 --> 08:00:17.740
Na na na na na.

08:00:17.740 --> 08:00:18.740
Every day.

08:00:18.740 --> 08:00:19.740
Like my eyes.

08:00:19.740 --> 08:00:21.740
Is it like my eyeballs stuck on the plate?

08:00:25.740 --> 08:00:26.740
Those bars were good.

08:00:26.740 --> 08:00:28.740
She punched the refline.

08:00:28.740 --> 08:00:29.740
I'm sorry.

08:00:32.740 --> 08:00:33.740
There's a fishing pit,

08:00:33.740 --> 08:00:35.740
but you have to be on a member's role to get it,

08:00:35.740 --> 08:00:37.740
and scaling pits are especially good.

08:00:38.740 --> 08:00:40.740
He means the money to do some...

08:00:42.740 --> 08:00:43.740
We hit 40!

08:00:43.740 --> 08:00:44.740
We hit 40!

08:00:47.740 --> 08:00:48.740
Actually so good.

08:00:49.740 --> 08:00:52.740
I might make one last cup of tea.

08:00:52.740 --> 08:00:53.740
We need a lock-in.

08:00:53.740 --> 08:00:55.740
We need a lock-in, okay.

08:00:56.740 --> 08:00:57.740
Lobster time.

08:00:57.740 --> 08:00:59.740
Oh no, I'm not gonna waste a lobster.

08:00:59.740 --> 08:01:00.740
That's crazy.

08:01:01.740 --> 08:01:03.740
I'm not gonna waste the lobsters.

08:01:03.740 --> 08:01:04.740
Oh!

08:01:04.740 --> 08:01:06.740
I mean, unless you give me lobsters,

08:01:06.740 --> 08:01:07.740
that's different.

08:01:07.740 --> 08:01:09.740
If you give me lobsters to waste,

08:01:09.740 --> 08:01:10.740
that's different.

08:01:10.740 --> 08:01:13.740
I'm not sure what my fricking rate is gonna be.

08:01:14.740 --> 08:01:15.740
Burn them all.

08:01:15.740 --> 08:01:17.740
Oh, I kicked my first one correctly!

08:01:19.740 --> 08:01:20.740
Wah!

08:01:20.740 --> 08:01:22.740
120?

08:01:23.740 --> 08:01:24.740
Oh no!

08:01:25.740 --> 08:01:26.740
They're getting burned.

08:01:26.740 --> 08:01:27.740
I know you can't see them over my...

08:01:27.740 --> 08:01:28.740
My heart.

08:01:29.740 --> 08:01:32.740
Can I move myself over just a tiny bit more?

08:01:35.740 --> 08:01:36.740
I don't want it.

08:01:36.740 --> 08:01:37.740
Actually, yeah.

08:01:37.740 --> 08:01:38.740
Yeah?

08:01:39.740 --> 08:01:40.740
Okay, yeah, that's better.

08:01:40.740 --> 08:01:42.740
You can, like, really see the inventory and stuff.

08:01:43.740 --> 08:01:44.740
Learning.

08:01:44.740 --> 08:01:45.740
We're gonna keep learning.

08:01:47.740 --> 08:01:50.740
If all the boys get 40 fishing,

08:01:50.740 --> 08:01:53.740
must the point will be for pure lobsters.

08:01:54.740 --> 08:01:55.740
Wait, you wanna do lobsters?

08:01:55.740 --> 08:01:57.740
Wait, you guys stay up all night

08:01:57.740 --> 08:01:59.740
just so you can get 40 fishing?

08:01:59.740 --> 08:02:01.740
So we can do lobster runs?

08:02:01.740 --> 08:02:03.740
120 is a lot.

08:02:03.740 --> 08:02:05.740
Look at the success rate, though.

08:02:05.740 --> 08:02:06.740
What does it say?

08:02:06.740 --> 08:02:08.740
Oh, the success rate is going up.

08:02:08.740 --> 08:02:09.740
It's 20%.

08:02:11.740 --> 08:02:12.740
What's that?

08:02:12.740 --> 08:02:13.740
Oh, that's mine.

08:02:13.740 --> 08:02:14.740
That's mine.

08:02:18.740 --> 08:02:19.740
Oh, rest well, those two sleep.

08:02:19.740 --> 08:02:21.740
I'm sorry, I streamed so long.

08:02:22.740 --> 08:02:24.740
For those of you who do need to leave,

08:02:24.740 --> 08:02:25.740
please don't worry.

08:02:25.740 --> 08:02:26.740
I'm literally doing this until the end.

08:02:26.740 --> 08:02:27.740
We're gonna read it in a mercy,

08:02:27.740 --> 08:02:29.740
because my poor voice is feeling it, Mr. Prev.

08:02:29.740 --> 08:02:31.740
There's no way you already have

08:02:31.740 --> 08:02:34.740
more freaking lobsters for me or something.

08:02:34.740 --> 08:02:35.740
Oh, okay, okay.

08:02:35.740 --> 08:02:36.740
We go pick, go pick.

08:02:36.740 --> 08:02:37.740
This is crazy.

08:02:39.740 --> 08:02:41.740
This is crazy.

08:02:41.740 --> 08:02:43.740
Can you get in trouble by Jagex

08:02:43.740 --> 08:02:44.740
for doing this?

08:02:45.740 --> 08:02:47.740
I can stay until 40, fish up or lobsters.

08:02:47.740 --> 08:02:49.740
No, that's crazy.

08:02:49.740 --> 08:02:51.740
I'm at 31 fishing at the moment.

08:02:52.740 --> 08:02:55.740
I got distracted watching you

08:02:55.740 --> 08:02:57.740
forgot to go back more.

08:02:58.740 --> 08:03:00.740
Goodnight, sleepers, rest well.

08:03:00.740 --> 08:03:02.740
Never can see how much seafood you are wasting.

08:03:02.740 --> 08:03:03.740
No!

08:03:05.740 --> 08:03:07.740
I just meant for the lobsters.

08:03:07.740 --> 08:03:08.740
That one.

08:03:08.740 --> 08:03:09.740
Long streams are good,

08:03:09.740 --> 08:03:11.740
because I can catch them when I wake up.

08:03:11.740 --> 08:03:15.740
I will sleep when I'm beat

08:03:15.740 --> 08:03:18.740
by drowning by more domination of the cheese.

08:03:19.740 --> 08:03:21.740
Oh, my God, we're almost 41.

08:03:21.740 --> 08:03:22.740
Oh, freaking crazy.

08:03:22.740 --> 08:03:24.740
We just wear a 40.

08:03:24.740 --> 08:03:26.740
Sleep is a construct.

08:03:26.740 --> 08:03:28.740
Construct is a government I've never given.

08:03:29.740 --> 08:03:31.740
Oh, my gosh.

08:03:33.740 --> 08:03:34.740
Can we do it?

08:03:34.740 --> 08:03:36.740
Can we make it 41 already?

08:03:38.740 --> 08:03:39.740
One more?

08:03:39.740 --> 08:03:40.740
Don't burn them.

08:03:40.740 --> 08:03:42.740
No, don't burn them.

08:03:42.740 --> 08:03:43.740
I should burn it.

08:03:43.740 --> 08:03:47.740
40 freaking one.

08:03:47.740 --> 08:03:48.740
No!

08:03:49.740 --> 08:03:51.740
This is so good.

08:03:53.740 --> 08:03:54.740
Oh, my God.

08:03:54.740 --> 08:03:56.740
You're already trading with me.

08:03:59.740 --> 08:04:02.740
I hope I can't get in trouble by jargates from this.

08:04:03.740 --> 08:04:05.740
Stuff like this can run the game for new players,

08:04:05.740 --> 08:04:07.740
so be careful about donations for new players long term.

08:04:09.740 --> 08:04:10.740
I have played,

08:04:10.740 --> 08:04:12.740
I do have a basic concept of the game,

08:04:12.740 --> 08:04:14.740
but if you're going to ask me to do

08:04:14.740 --> 08:04:16.740
dungeoning and stuff,

08:04:16.740 --> 08:04:18.740
I could not tell you where the gargoyles are,

08:04:18.740 --> 08:04:20.740
but apparently gargoyles.

08:04:20.740 --> 08:04:22.740
Hey, Strony, how do you get a fishing rod?

08:04:22.740 --> 08:04:24.740
I've never tried this before.

08:04:24.740 --> 08:04:26.740
Aw, you tiny culls.

08:04:27.740 --> 08:04:29.740
You would have to level up

08:04:29.740 --> 08:04:32.740
with that fishing net you got from Tutorial Island,

08:04:32.740 --> 08:04:34.740
but you can't use it here.

08:04:34.740 --> 08:04:36.740
You would have to go back to Lumbridge.

08:04:36.740 --> 08:04:38.740
This is Lumbridge, where you came from.

08:04:38.740 --> 08:04:40.740
You can use the magic spell to teleport,

08:04:40.740 --> 08:04:44.740
and you have to do net fishing here until 20.

08:04:44.740 --> 08:04:47.740
And then you can come here for a fly fishing.

08:04:48.740 --> 08:04:50.740
I'm so sorry, Little Reefling.

08:04:50.740 --> 08:04:52.740
There are gates to level up on fishing.

08:04:52.740 --> 08:04:54.740
They're probably a lot better than my method,

08:04:54.740 --> 08:04:56.740
but that's why I've always used it with the kids.

08:04:56.740 --> 08:04:59.740
Gargoyles are decent money for mid players,

08:04:59.740 --> 08:05:02.740
but 75 slayers is probably the slowest of them even.

08:05:03.740 --> 08:05:06.740
That burn rate is looking a bit rough on the lobster,

08:05:06.740 --> 08:05:08.740
so I'm not going to lie.

08:05:08.740 --> 08:05:09.740
Anyone got some feathers on them?

08:05:09.740 --> 08:05:11.740
So, well, I guess that's all great.

08:05:11.740 --> 08:05:13.740
Aw, thank you, Little Reefling.

08:05:15.740 --> 08:05:17.740
That burn rate is looking rough.

08:05:19.740 --> 08:05:20.740
Oh, my God, what should I do?

08:05:20.740 --> 08:05:21.740
I feel about it.

08:05:23.740 --> 08:05:25.740
How expensive are the lobsters?

08:05:25.740 --> 08:05:27.740
I feel like they're probably breaking through.

08:05:29.740 --> 08:05:30.740
We're burnt through the fish already.

08:05:30.740 --> 08:05:31.740
No, we're not.

08:05:31.740 --> 08:05:32.740
I tell a lie.

08:05:32.740 --> 08:05:33.740
Let's forget.

08:05:33.740 --> 08:05:36.740
Who are you coming so fast?

08:05:38.740 --> 08:05:39.740
You just handed me them.

08:05:39.740 --> 08:05:41.740
Is there a bank nearby?

08:05:42.740 --> 08:05:44.740
I thought the bank was over there.

08:05:44.740 --> 08:05:45.740
Am I going crazy?

08:05:45.740 --> 08:05:46.740
Is there a bank up there?

08:05:47.740 --> 08:05:48.740
He's just disappeared again.

08:05:48.740 --> 08:05:50.740
Is there a bank up there?

08:05:51.740 --> 08:05:53.740
Ageville has a bank.

08:05:53.740 --> 08:05:54.740
Oh, I'll make sure you...

08:05:55.740 --> 08:05:56.740
Call meville,

08:05:56.740 --> 08:05:58.740
because, I don't know, there's something.

08:05:59.740 --> 08:06:01.740
If I could trade.

08:06:01.740 --> 08:06:02.740
I'm so sorry.

08:06:02.740 --> 08:06:03.740
Wait, I'll trade.

08:06:03.740 --> 08:06:04.740
I'm sorry.

08:06:04.740 --> 08:06:05.740
I'll trade.

08:06:07.740 --> 08:06:08.740
Okay, I'll trade.

08:06:08.740 --> 08:06:09.740
I'll trade.

08:06:09.740 --> 08:06:10.740
I'll trade.

08:06:10.740 --> 08:06:11.740
I'll trade.

08:06:14.740 --> 08:06:15.740
Bro's hacking.

08:06:16.740 --> 08:06:18.740
Can you even hack in RuneScape?

08:06:18.740 --> 08:06:20.740
That sounds like it's nice and possible,

08:06:20.740 --> 08:06:21.740
because of the way the server is.

08:06:21.740 --> 08:06:23.740
Call meville, because I'm edging.

08:06:23.740 --> 08:06:24.740
Yes!

08:06:24.740 --> 08:06:25.740
Call meville, because I'm edging.

08:06:29.740 --> 08:06:30.740
I came up with that myself.

08:06:30.740 --> 08:06:31.740
I did.

08:06:31.740 --> 08:06:32.740
I did.

08:06:32.740 --> 08:06:33.740
It's true.

08:06:33.740 --> 08:06:35.740
You could start using a range closer

08:06:35.740 --> 08:06:37.740
to the bank rather than the fire rate,

08:06:37.740 --> 08:06:39.740
since you don't fish in anymore.

08:06:39.740 --> 08:06:40.740
Probably.

08:06:41.740 --> 08:06:42.740
That's very true.

08:06:48.740 --> 08:06:51.740
Oh, that burn rate is rough on those lobbies.

08:06:52.740 --> 08:06:54.740
Every lobster that we burn is a missing,

08:06:54.740 --> 08:06:56.740
like, 120, which is, like,

08:06:56.740 --> 08:06:57.740
so frigging thingy.

08:06:57.740 --> 08:06:58.740
I lied.

08:06:58.740 --> 08:06:59.740
I made it.

08:06:59.740 --> 08:07:01.740
Wait, there's another refling.

08:07:01.740 --> 08:07:02.740
There's the strategy.

08:07:02.740 --> 08:07:03.740
Hold on.

08:07:05.740 --> 08:07:07.740
Wait, you've got lobster runs as well?

08:07:08.740 --> 08:07:09.740
Whoa!

08:07:10.740 --> 08:07:12.740
Isn't this not, like, thousands,

08:07:12.740 --> 08:07:14.740
like, thousands of gold?

08:07:14.740 --> 08:07:15.740
Am I not going mental?

08:07:15.740 --> 08:07:16.740
I feel like this is, like, thousands.

08:07:16.740 --> 08:07:17.740
Go ahead and run.

08:07:17.740 --> 08:07:19.740
Energy needs to recharge.

08:07:21.740 --> 08:07:22.740
Whoa, we got a full shoot.

08:07:23.740 --> 08:07:24.740
Five in a row.

08:07:25.740 --> 08:07:26.740
42!

08:07:30.740 --> 08:07:32.740
It depends on how fast you want to get this level,

08:07:32.740 --> 08:07:34.740
but Bar Village is more...

08:07:35.740 --> 08:07:36.740
The most...

08:07:36.740 --> 08:07:38.740
The most cooking ranges.

08:07:43.740 --> 08:07:45.740
You can make a million per hour?

08:07:47.740 --> 08:07:49.740
A million XP per hour?

08:07:49.740 --> 08:07:50.740
Strony, even if it says

08:07:50.740 --> 08:07:52.740
and you've already been given millions?

08:07:52.740 --> 08:07:53.740
Honestly.

08:07:53.740 --> 08:07:55.740
If you take the exclamation mark,

08:07:55.740 --> 08:07:56.740
praise?

08:07:56.740 --> 08:07:57.740
What?

08:08:00.740 --> 08:08:01.740
Stop!

08:08:01.740 --> 08:08:02.740
Did you make me...

08:08:02.740 --> 08:08:04.740
Did you just make me fall for something obvious?

08:08:05.740 --> 08:08:06.740
I don't know.

08:08:18.740 --> 08:08:20.740
Yeah, I spent 160 on 2k.

08:08:20.740 --> 08:08:21.740
That's, like, two voxels.

08:08:23.740 --> 08:08:24.740
You have to take that.

08:08:24.740 --> 08:08:25.740
I'm afterward.

08:08:28.740 --> 08:08:29.740
Oh, knee drop, knee drop.

08:08:29.740 --> 08:08:31.740
Oh, yeah, that was a much better lobster

08:08:31.740 --> 08:08:33.740
cooking batch than the previous one,

08:08:33.740 --> 08:08:35.740
the other one that I absolutely cooked with them.

08:08:39.740 --> 08:08:40.740
Ooh, fishy.

08:08:42.740 --> 08:08:44.740
Oh, right, okay, take that.

08:08:45.740 --> 08:08:46.740
Let's try and do this.

08:08:47.740 --> 08:08:48.740
Exclamation mark, praise?

08:08:48.740 --> 08:08:50.740
Let it all be set to error.

08:08:54.740 --> 08:08:55.740
Oh!

08:08:55.740 --> 08:08:56.740
It worked!

08:08:57.740 --> 08:08:59.740
Oh, there are 150 a pack?

08:08:59.740 --> 08:09:00.740
Ooh.

08:09:01.740 --> 08:09:04.740
If I buy feathers from people we drop on?

08:09:04.740 --> 08:09:05.740
Okay, 300k.

08:09:05.740 --> 08:09:06.740
Oh, great.

08:09:07.740 --> 08:09:09.740
Right, don't buy any more fish,

08:09:09.740 --> 08:09:11.740
cos it's literally I've got

08:09:11.740 --> 08:09:14.740
less than 50 minutes now.

08:09:14.740 --> 08:09:17.740
I'm gonna go quickly grab a bottle of water.

08:09:18.740 --> 08:09:19.740
Cos I'm so thirsty.

08:09:19.740 --> 08:09:20.740
I don't need to,

08:09:20.740 --> 08:09:21.740
I don't need to,

08:09:21.740 --> 08:09:22.740
I don't need to,

08:09:22.740 --> 08:09:23.740
I don't need to,

08:09:23.740 --> 08:09:24.740
I don't need to,

08:09:24.740 --> 08:09:25.740
I don't need to,

08:09:25.740 --> 08:09:26.740
I don't need to.

08:09:26.740 --> 08:09:27.740
Ooh.

08:09:46.740 --> 08:09:47.740
Wow!

08:09:48.740 --> 08:09:49.740
Ooh, ooh, I hear burning noises.

08:09:49.740 --> 08:09:50.740
I hear burning noises.

08:09:51.740 --> 08:09:52.740
Cos we're burning deficies.

08:09:53.740 --> 08:09:55.740
Right, I've got a new bowl of water.

08:09:56.740 --> 08:09:59.540
I'm so hydrated, but I don't want to pee, I want to fish max.

08:09:59.540 --> 08:10:01.820
I need to fish max, you don't understand.

08:10:01.820 --> 08:10:03.940
I'm fish maxing, you wouldn't get it.

08:10:05.900 --> 08:10:07.700
I have lobby maxing, you wouldn't get it.

08:10:07.700 --> 08:10:09.380
You wouldn't understand, Mum.

08:10:09.380 --> 08:10:10.620
Mum, I need membership.

08:10:16.100 --> 08:10:18.460
I'll give it a try, I'll be back in a minute.

08:10:18.460 --> 08:10:19.300
Go for it.

08:10:20.460 --> 08:10:22.140
I've only been listening to ASMR for about a minute,

08:10:22.140 --> 08:10:23.580
so I'm excited for starting ASMR.

08:10:25.020 --> 08:10:26.180
I definitely am not the best.

08:10:26.180 --> 08:10:30.380
I would say like, Mercy and Icy are like super professional.

08:10:30.380 --> 08:10:31.740
Super idol.

08:10:32.740 --> 08:10:34.780
43!

08:10:34.780 --> 08:10:36.380
And we've had a lot of two-stacked...

08:10:36.380 --> 08:10:37.980
Oh, I was about to say, we've got two-stacked

08:10:37.980 --> 08:10:40.020
for all of the lobbies not being burnt.

08:10:41.260 --> 08:10:42.420
Spoke too soon there.

08:10:46.500 --> 08:10:47.620
Hydration check.

08:10:49.940 --> 08:10:50.940
Wow.

08:10:51.940 --> 08:10:58.740
You know, as much as the chef hat and the apron are made out of gold,

08:10:58.740 --> 08:11:00.940
I don't think it's actually making me a better chef.

08:11:05.540 --> 08:11:07.740
How much longer before you have to leave?

08:11:07.740 --> 08:11:08.780
Is there a exact time?

08:11:08.780 --> 08:11:11.060
Mercy is coming on in 45 minutes.

08:11:11.060 --> 08:11:14.380
I'm going to redirect into her because I need to do vocal rest

08:11:14.380 --> 08:11:16.500
before the ASMR stream tomorrow.

08:11:16.500 --> 08:11:18.900
And it hurts to talk right now, which is a shame.

08:11:18.900 --> 08:11:20.820
It's literally the only reason I'm going offline.

08:11:20.820 --> 08:11:23.620
I probably didn't during the stream every single day if I killed it, honestly.

08:11:25.420 --> 08:11:30.420
But my voice is sore and I need to be quiet for the ASMR.

08:11:30.420 --> 08:11:32.220
Tomorrow's going to be a short...

08:11:32.220 --> 08:11:35.020
No, you guys are so quick on it.

08:11:36.420 --> 08:11:37.620
This is crazy.

08:11:38.420 --> 08:11:39.300
It doesn't make sense.

08:11:39.300 --> 08:11:41.220
They're gold, literally.

08:11:42.420 --> 08:11:43.780
Drink some nice hot tea.

08:11:43.780 --> 08:11:45.940
Yes, I've had too much tea today.

08:11:45.940 --> 08:11:47.740
Because I put honey in my tea,

08:11:47.740 --> 08:11:51.340
it gets, like, sickly if I have too much of it,

08:11:51.340 --> 08:11:53.700
so I have to swap to water only.

08:11:54.900 --> 08:11:56.980
What's your target that you're going for this stream?

08:11:56.980 --> 08:12:01.900
I wanted to get 50, but I don't think it's possible because of time.

08:12:01.900 --> 08:12:06.260
I didn't realise how fast cooking the fish was going to be

08:12:06.260 --> 08:12:08.020
if I wasn't, like, doing those quests.

08:12:08.020 --> 08:12:12.300
But I had fun doing quests for the reason, so actually, I don't really regret it at all.

08:12:12.300 --> 08:12:13.980
I'll be cutting it close.

08:12:13.980 --> 08:12:17.660
Like, if we're literally, like, a couple of minutes away, then I'll do it.

08:12:17.700 --> 08:12:20.100
But, unfortunately, my voice is, like...

08:12:20.100 --> 08:12:21.100
Yeah.

08:12:21.100 --> 08:12:24.580
And most of all, I felt that one literally...

08:12:25.580 --> 08:12:27.020
I do look stylish, though.

08:12:27.020 --> 08:12:27.940
I mean, look at that.

08:12:27.940 --> 08:12:29.860
Something a little cosy.

08:12:32.180 --> 08:12:34.380
Look at the detail in my eyes and everything.

08:12:34.380 --> 08:12:37.180
The polys are the favourites all the time.

08:12:38.700 --> 08:12:39.660
Honey in tea is good.

08:12:39.660 --> 08:12:41.700
Maybe I'll add less honey.

08:12:41.700 --> 08:12:42.220
I don't know.

08:12:42.220 --> 08:12:44.860
I feel, like, sickly if I...

08:12:44.860 --> 08:12:46.060
I don't know, I just can't.

08:12:46.060 --> 08:12:47.460
It's just not working.

08:12:48.660 --> 08:12:50.340
It's just not working.

08:12:51.820 --> 08:12:55.460
I know you can have those throat sweets,

08:12:55.460 --> 08:13:00.780
but I don't know if they actually do anything or just, like, make my teeth feel a little sugary.

08:13:00.780 --> 08:13:02.540
It's, like, my biggest frickin' thing.

08:13:02.540 --> 08:13:03.180
Wait, hold on.

08:13:03.180 --> 08:13:04.420
Am I taking this?

08:13:04.420 --> 08:13:06.580
I can't remember who I keep taking off of.

08:13:07.580 --> 08:13:12.540
I'm sorry for whoever the other lobster runners, like, I can't remember between...

08:13:13.740 --> 08:13:15.900
200k feathers under me.

08:13:15.900 --> 08:13:16.420
Damn.

08:13:17.420 --> 08:13:17.940
Damn.

08:13:19.780 --> 08:13:21.620
Damn, you're in a wedding dress and everything.

08:13:21.620 --> 08:13:22.420
What the heck?

08:13:23.220 --> 08:13:25.220
All of your black hair, this is cute.

08:13:25.220 --> 08:13:26.580
And your little cape.

08:13:26.580 --> 08:13:28.220
Oh, I forgot to get us green capes.

08:13:28.220 --> 08:13:28.980
Oops.

08:13:28.980 --> 08:13:29.820
We'll do the next thing.

08:13:31.140 --> 08:13:32.740
Can you say throat sweets again?

08:13:32.740 --> 08:13:33.420
Yeah, throat sweets.

08:13:34.540 --> 08:13:37.180
They, like, help with your throat when you feel sick or whatever.

08:13:37.180 --> 08:13:39.020
Or if you've got strain, I guess.

08:13:41.380 --> 08:13:42.300
Are you still streaming?

08:13:42.300 --> 08:13:45.820
Yeah, um, we've got roughly 40 minutes.

08:13:45.860 --> 08:13:47.140
And then it's Mercy's time.

08:13:47.140 --> 08:13:48.660
We're gonna redirect into Mercy.

08:13:50.380 --> 08:13:51.980
Bon bon.

08:13:58.620 --> 08:14:02.140
Oh, I'm making an absolute mockery of this one.

08:14:02.140 --> 08:14:03.540
I don't think I'm gonna burn it, alright.

08:14:03.540 --> 08:14:04.100
Yeah.

08:14:04.860 --> 08:14:06.740
Oh, we're close to the 44, though.

08:14:10.780 --> 08:14:11.540
Bicola.

08:14:13.340 --> 08:14:14.340
Wait, Bicola?

08:14:16.820 --> 08:14:17.820
Wait, what's Bicola?

08:14:19.820 --> 08:14:21.820
I can hear that, Bicola.

08:14:21.820 --> 08:14:22.820
What's that mean, chan?

08:14:22.820 --> 08:14:23.820
Huh?

08:14:23.820 --> 08:14:24.820
Eto?

08:14:24.820 --> 08:14:25.820
What's that?

08:14:25.820 --> 08:14:26.820
Bicola.

08:14:31.820 --> 08:14:34.820
A tape of throat lozenger.

08:14:34.820 --> 08:14:35.820
Oh, it's a cough drug.

08:14:35.820 --> 08:14:37.820
Bicola is a brand of lozenger.

08:14:37.820 --> 08:14:38.820
Oh, okay, okay.

08:14:38.820 --> 08:14:39.820
Oh, sorry.

08:14:40.820 --> 08:14:41.820
Wah.

08:14:41.820 --> 08:14:42.820
Here you go.

08:14:42.820 --> 08:14:43.820
Here you go.

08:14:45.820 --> 08:14:46.820
Lobster runner.

08:14:46.820 --> 08:14:47.820
I can't believe it.

08:14:47.820 --> 08:14:49.820
Might as well do 99 room crafting while we're at it.

08:14:49.820 --> 08:14:51.820
You guys will make it super easy.

08:14:54.820 --> 08:14:57.820
It's the comical jingle that was very common.

08:14:57.820 --> 08:14:59.820
Oh, it's a commercial jingle.

08:14:59.820 --> 08:15:00.820
Sorry.

08:15:01.820 --> 08:15:03.820
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

08:15:04.820 --> 08:15:05.820
But not I see smokers.

08:15:05.820 --> 08:15:06.820
But I see.

08:15:09.820 --> 08:15:10.820
There's a new...

08:15:12.820 --> 08:15:14.820
New room craft minigame, and it's fun.

08:15:15.820 --> 08:15:17.820
Anyone else able to see the feathers yet?

08:15:17.820 --> 08:15:20.820
No, you might have to pick them up in case it's too much when you defawn.

08:15:22.820 --> 08:15:24.820
No feathers.

08:15:27.820 --> 08:15:29.820
Yeah, hopefully they don't defawn,

08:15:29.820 --> 08:15:31.820
because 20k feathers isn't cheap.

08:15:35.820 --> 08:15:37.820
Did you time the six feathers?

08:15:37.820 --> 08:15:38.820
Johnny's so cool and got excited.

08:15:38.820 --> 08:15:39.820
This is Coca-Cola.

08:15:39.820 --> 08:15:40.820
It's so much.

08:15:42.820 --> 08:15:43.820
How long does it take after doffin'?

08:15:43.820 --> 08:15:45.820
I thought it was 60 seconds.

08:15:46.820 --> 08:15:49.820
If it's been 60 seconds, I would just scoop them back up again,

08:15:49.820 --> 08:15:50.820
because I would hate them to...

08:15:50.820 --> 08:15:52.820
No, not the headbinds!

08:15:57.820 --> 08:15:58.820
What a book.

08:15:58.820 --> 08:15:59.820
Wah.

08:16:00.820 --> 08:16:02.820
Level 40 fricking four.

08:16:03.820 --> 08:16:06.820
If I could stop fricking burning them lobsters,

08:16:06.820 --> 08:16:07.820
they'll...

08:16:07.820 --> 08:16:08.820
Wah.

08:16:08.820 --> 08:16:10.820
They'll accept trade, accept trade.

08:16:18.820 --> 08:16:19.820
We're getting there though.

08:16:20.820 --> 08:16:22.820
Do you have less burn chance on a...

08:16:22.820 --> 08:16:24.820
a grill thing?

08:16:24.820 --> 08:16:25.820
An oven?

08:16:25.820 --> 08:16:27.820
A grill thing.

08:16:28.820 --> 08:16:30.820
30 seconds to appear to others,

08:16:30.820 --> 08:16:32.820
three minutes to despawn.

08:16:32.820 --> 08:16:33.820
We're learning.

08:16:33.820 --> 08:16:35.820
We're learning the ways a burn stage is done.

08:16:41.820 --> 08:16:44.820
No only in whose side it is.

08:16:46.820 --> 08:16:47.820
Wah.

08:16:47.820 --> 08:16:50.820
Range and fire are the same kissing chance, mostly.

08:16:50.820 --> 08:16:51.820
Okay, there's no point.

08:16:51.820 --> 08:16:55.820
I was like, maybe we should move this production line,

08:16:55.820 --> 08:16:56.820
but...

08:16:56.820 --> 08:16:58.820
I think the rooflings are just fishing away.

08:16:58.820 --> 08:17:00.820
They're just having a good time.

08:17:02.820 --> 08:17:05.820
We definitely need to level ourselves up,

08:17:05.820 --> 08:17:08.820
because we're the target for a lot of NPCs

08:17:08.820 --> 08:17:11.820
when we're trying to travel through areas.

08:17:16.820 --> 08:17:17.820
The stream's ending in 40 minutes.

08:17:17.820 --> 08:17:19.820
Does that mean brush teeth intend?

08:17:19.820 --> 08:17:20.820
Yes!

08:17:20.820 --> 08:17:21.820
We have to brush our teeth.

08:17:23.820 --> 08:17:25.820
Okay, thank goodness I didn't make another teeth,

08:17:25.820 --> 08:17:27.820
because I wouldn't have been able to brush my teeth.

08:17:29.820 --> 08:17:30.820
If you're having...

08:17:30.820 --> 08:17:32.820
If you want to brush your teeth with us

08:17:33.820 --> 08:17:35.820
for your enameled...

08:17:35.820 --> 08:17:38.820
Don't eat or drink fizzy juice.

08:17:39.820 --> 08:17:41.820
You can have water for the next 30 minutes,

08:17:41.820 --> 08:17:44.820
but you're not to brush your teeth if you've eaten

08:17:44.820 --> 08:17:46.820
after 30 minutes,

08:17:46.820 --> 08:17:48.820
because it hurts your enamel

08:17:48.820 --> 08:17:50.820
rather than helping it.

08:17:50.820 --> 08:17:52.820
I think that's my only note

08:17:52.820 --> 08:17:54.820
if you want to brush your teeth with us.

08:17:55.820 --> 08:17:56.820
Not so fun story.

08:17:56.820 --> 08:17:58.820
My brother once choked on one

08:17:58.820 --> 08:18:00.820
of those throat sweeps

08:18:00.820 --> 08:18:02.820
and helped with the throat throat.

08:18:03.820 --> 08:18:05.820
Ooh, that's terrifying.

08:18:06.820 --> 08:18:08.820
45?

08:18:09.820 --> 08:18:10.820
45?

08:18:10.820 --> 08:18:11.820
45?

08:18:11.820 --> 08:18:13.820
We're at 61 8 feet.

08:18:13.820 --> 08:18:14.820
Oh, goodness.

08:18:14.820 --> 08:18:15.820
We may actually make the 50.

08:18:15.820 --> 08:18:16.820
You know that.

08:18:19.820 --> 08:18:21.820
Ah, my throat farted when I swallowed it.

08:18:21.820 --> 08:18:22.820
Did you hear that?

08:18:22.820 --> 08:18:24.820
That was like an internal throat fart.

08:18:31.820 --> 08:18:33.820
I said that!

08:18:37.820 --> 08:18:38.820
1 in 3.

08:18:39.820 --> 08:18:40.820
Oh, baby.

08:18:43.820 --> 08:18:46.820
He learned so much from this educational

08:18:46.820 --> 08:18:48.820
and professional streamer.

08:18:48.820 --> 08:18:50.820
That takes me back to the toothbrush

08:18:50.820 --> 08:18:51.820
somewhere.

08:18:58.820 --> 08:19:00.820
We are so going to get 50

08:19:00.820 --> 08:19:02.820
before Mercy comes on and makes me funny.

08:19:02.820 --> 08:19:04.820
Oh, Mercy's actually...

08:19:04.820 --> 08:19:06.820
I think she's decorating alternative

08:19:06.820 --> 08:19:08.820
outfits for us.

08:19:08.820 --> 08:19:09.820
So...

08:19:09.820 --> 08:19:11.820
We are in...

08:19:12.820 --> 08:19:14.820
Have our lobster reserves ran dry.

08:19:14.820 --> 08:19:16.820
Have I perished all the lobsters

08:19:16.820 --> 08:19:18.820
for sale in the Grand Exchange?

08:19:19.820 --> 08:19:20.820
Oh, unless.

08:19:20.820 --> 08:19:21.820
Unless.

08:19:21.820 --> 08:19:22.820
Unless.

08:19:24.820 --> 08:19:27.820
You guys are sweating to get me to level 99.

08:19:27.820 --> 08:19:28.820
You're actually so kind.

08:19:28.820 --> 08:19:30.820
I just want to say a special thank you

08:19:30.820 --> 08:19:31.820
for those of you who are like

08:19:31.820 --> 08:19:33.820
unironically feeding me.

08:19:33.820 --> 08:19:34.820
This is going to make the school

08:19:34.820 --> 08:19:36.820
way faster doing this.

08:19:37.820 --> 08:19:38.820
Hmm.

08:19:45.820 --> 08:19:47.820
You'd say that Stronny's a really good drop.

08:19:47.820 --> 08:19:48.820
What?

08:19:49.820 --> 08:19:51.820
Do you think she'd make you one of those?

08:19:51.820 --> 08:19:52.820
What?

08:19:53.820 --> 08:19:54.820
What is going on?

08:19:55.820 --> 08:19:57.820
No stops on this lobster train.

08:19:57.820 --> 08:19:58.820
Literally.

08:20:02.820 --> 08:20:04.820
I know the fishing spot.

08:20:07.820 --> 08:20:09.820
Nearly one million XP an hour.

08:20:09.820 --> 08:20:10.820
Stop.

08:20:10.820 --> 08:20:11.820
Is that it?

08:20:11.820 --> 08:20:12.820
Unlucky.

08:20:13.820 --> 08:20:14.820
I love stories.

08:20:15.820 --> 08:20:17.820
I suppose if I didn't burn them,

08:20:17.820 --> 08:20:18.820
that's very plausible.

08:20:18.820 --> 08:20:20.820
Every stack is like...

08:20:21.820 --> 08:20:23.820
What, 26 inventory?

08:20:24.820 --> 08:20:25.820
Like...

08:20:27.820 --> 08:20:29.820
I think five tables are shooting it.

08:20:29.820 --> 08:20:30.820
I don't know.

08:20:30.820 --> 08:20:32.820
With some tick manipulation.

08:20:32.820 --> 08:20:34.820
I don't know what the tick rate manipulation

08:20:34.820 --> 08:20:35.820
stuff means.

08:20:35.820 --> 08:20:37.820
I hear it all the time though.

08:20:38.820 --> 08:20:39.820
It's like, oh you just got to make sure

08:20:39.820 --> 08:20:40.820
you do this on the tick

08:20:40.820 --> 08:20:41.820
and you have to eat.

08:20:41.820 --> 08:20:42.820
You have to eat the food on the tick.

08:20:42.820 --> 08:20:44.820
Oh, can I swap out prayer?

08:20:44.820 --> 08:20:45.820
I need a prayer flick.

08:20:45.820 --> 08:20:46.820
I need a prayer flick.

08:20:46.820 --> 08:20:48.820
Like, I'm like, what does any of this mean?

08:20:51.820 --> 08:20:52.820
You're crazy.

08:20:52.820 --> 08:20:53.820
Crazy.

08:20:55.820 --> 08:20:57.820
Also, for those of you using runelight,

08:20:57.820 --> 08:21:00.820
if you don't want an item name to show up,

08:21:01.820 --> 08:21:02.820
can hold,

08:21:03.820 --> 08:21:04.820
alt,

08:21:04.820 --> 08:21:05.820
and write...

08:21:06.820 --> 08:21:07.820
the irons here.

08:21:08.820 --> 08:21:10.820
We're getting the real stress here.

08:21:13.820 --> 08:21:16.820
Being an apron has always been a dream of mine.

08:21:17.820 --> 08:21:21.820
The game runs on 0.62nd increments called ticks.

08:21:21.820 --> 08:21:22.820
That's it.

08:21:22.820 --> 08:21:23.820
Oh!

08:21:25.820 --> 08:21:26.820
That basic...

08:21:26.820 --> 08:21:29.820
Okay, that just like explains everything.

08:21:31.820 --> 08:21:32.820
That's it.

08:21:32.820 --> 08:21:33.820
That's all it took.

08:21:33.820 --> 08:21:35.820
One sentence and it all makes sense.

08:21:35.820 --> 08:21:37.820
Okay, because I was like,

08:21:37.820 --> 08:21:39.820
prayer, I need prayer flick on this tick.

08:21:39.820 --> 08:21:41.820
Like, over prayer flick.

08:21:41.820 --> 08:21:42.820
I'm like, what?

08:21:42.820 --> 08:21:44.820
I'm not, I'm even sure that's supposed to be

08:21:44.820 --> 08:21:45.820
having the games played.

08:21:45.820 --> 08:21:46.820
I don't know.

08:21:46.820 --> 08:21:47.820
Did the devs intend that?

08:21:47.820 --> 08:21:48.820
But they never patched it out.

08:21:48.820 --> 08:21:49.820
So I guess prayer

08:21:49.820 --> 08:21:51.820
flicking is the right way to go.

08:21:52.820 --> 08:21:54.820
Because prayer drains so fast.

08:21:55.820 --> 08:22:00.820
I'm getting new brain cells just from streaming.

08:22:02.820 --> 08:22:03.820
Level 47?

08:22:04.820 --> 08:22:05.820
No.

08:22:06.820 --> 08:22:07.820
Oh wait, sorry, 46.

08:22:08.820 --> 08:22:09.820
Two more.

08:22:09.820 --> 08:22:10.820
If I don't burn these.

08:22:10.820 --> 08:22:11.820
If I don't burn this one.

08:22:13.820 --> 08:22:14.820
46.

08:22:15.820 --> 08:22:16.820
Oh my gosh.

08:22:18.820 --> 08:22:19.820
We're so MLG pro.

08:22:21.820 --> 08:22:22.820
Look at me, bro.

08:22:23.820 --> 08:22:24.820
Look at me, bro.

08:22:24.820 --> 08:22:25.820
MLG pro.

08:22:27.820 --> 08:22:28.820
Let me see.

08:22:28.820 --> 08:22:29.820
Oh my god, my tummy's rumbling.

08:22:29.820 --> 08:22:30.820
You could hear that over the background.

08:22:31.820 --> 08:22:32.820
Wow.

08:22:34.820 --> 08:22:35.820
I'm literally slid.

08:22:37.820 --> 08:22:38.820
It's not intended,

08:22:38.820 --> 08:22:40.820
but Jagex just accepted.

08:22:40.820 --> 08:22:41.820
I was going to say,

08:22:41.820 --> 08:22:42.820
if they didn't,

08:22:42.820 --> 08:22:44.820
whenever like something gets discovered,

08:22:44.820 --> 08:22:47.820
like, so this is for the overwatch players,

08:22:47.820 --> 08:22:49.820
but Mercy had a guardian angel leap.

08:22:50.820 --> 08:22:53.820
And it got discovered

08:22:53.820 --> 08:22:55.820
and it was never patched out the game,

08:22:55.820 --> 08:22:56.820
which meant it was intended,

08:22:56.820 --> 08:22:58.820
even though it was never described.

08:22:59.820 --> 08:23:00.820
So that's how I take it.

08:23:00.820 --> 08:23:02.820
If the devs don't patch it out,

08:23:02.820 --> 08:23:04.820
it's allowed, basically.

08:23:05.820 --> 08:23:07.820
Once you get to level 92,

08:23:07.820 --> 08:23:08.820
you're halfway there.

08:23:08.820 --> 08:23:09.820
Yay.

08:23:10.820 --> 08:23:11.820
Anyway, congrats, dumb dumb.

08:23:11.820 --> 08:23:13.820
This was the stream I was looking forward.

08:23:13.820 --> 08:23:14.820
The less,

08:23:14.820 --> 08:23:16.820
but ended up probably being one of the funniest,

08:23:16.820 --> 08:23:17.820
really?

08:23:18.820 --> 08:23:19.820
It's just me receiving,

08:23:19.820 --> 08:23:22.820
like, tons of in-game currency for doing nothing.

08:23:25.820 --> 08:23:26.820
But please don't worry,

08:23:26.820 --> 08:23:27.820
if you're interested in more,

08:23:27.820 --> 08:23:28.820
like, multiplayer games

08:23:28.820 --> 08:23:30.820
where we can play together,

08:23:30.820 --> 08:23:31.820
I definitely am doing,

08:23:31.820 --> 08:23:34.820
like, a whole variety of things going on.

08:23:40.820 --> 08:23:41.820
I would definitely, like,

08:23:41.820 --> 08:23:42.820
other ones, like...

08:23:45.820 --> 08:23:46.820
No, that's not what's official name.

08:23:46.820 --> 08:23:47.820
What's the name of the game?

08:23:48.820 --> 08:23:49.820
Fall Guys.

08:23:50.820 --> 08:23:52.820
I wanted to give Fortnite a chance.

08:23:52.820 --> 08:23:54.820
Apparently, Fortnite

08:23:54.820 --> 08:23:56.820
has added, like, different game modes.

08:23:58.820 --> 08:24:01.820
Call of Duty has apparently introduced prop one.

08:24:01.820 --> 08:24:02.820
I don't know if we could...

08:24:02.820 --> 08:24:03.820
Oh, there's a captain.

08:24:03.820 --> 08:24:06.820
Do we do the captain mini-quest?

08:24:07.820 --> 08:24:10.820
I don't know if we do the captain one.

08:24:11.820 --> 08:24:14.820
At the Fortnite metal path.

08:24:15.820 --> 08:24:18.820
I just shit out my hands.

08:24:18.820 --> 08:24:19.820
It's...

08:24:19.820 --> 08:24:21.820
Is it bad?

08:24:22.820 --> 08:24:24.820
Is it a bad quest?

08:24:24.820 --> 08:24:25.820
Is it the captain,

08:24:25.820 --> 08:24:27.820
or is it a good one?

08:24:27.820 --> 08:24:28.820
It's quick.

08:24:28.820 --> 08:24:30.820
Okay, if it's quick, let's try it.

08:24:30.820 --> 08:24:32.820
Problem is, these old-time...

08:24:32.820 --> 08:24:35.820
Uh, sure, I'll help you unlock your chest.

08:24:35.820 --> 08:24:37.820
There are three columns.

08:24:37.820 --> 08:24:38.820
What you need to do is match up

08:24:38.820 --> 08:24:40.820
each picture on the column.

08:24:41.820 --> 08:24:42.820
A bar,

08:24:43.820 --> 08:24:44.820
a ring,

08:24:44.820 --> 08:24:45.820
and a bowl.

08:24:49.820 --> 08:24:51.820
Oh, got a wee golden ring!

08:24:52.820 --> 08:24:53.820
Um...

08:24:54.820 --> 08:24:55.820
What'd I do with it?

08:24:55.820 --> 08:24:56.820
I already have a diamond ring on

08:24:56.820 --> 08:24:57.820
from a wreathling,

08:24:57.820 --> 08:24:58.820
so I can't take it off.

08:25:01.820 --> 08:25:02.820
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.

08:25:02.820 --> 08:25:03.820
I completely forgot

08:25:03.820 --> 08:25:05.820
we're trying to lobster max right now.

08:25:05.820 --> 08:25:06.820
Oops.

08:25:07.820 --> 08:25:08.820
One less space,

08:25:08.820 --> 08:25:09.820
one less space,

08:25:09.820 --> 08:25:11.820
because I'll drop the golden ring.

08:25:16.820 --> 08:25:17.820
Oh, I could have gave you

08:25:17.820 --> 08:25:18.820
the golden ring, actually,

08:25:18.820 --> 08:25:21.820
because lobsters trading there.

08:25:21.820 --> 08:25:23.820
The ring's your problem now.

08:25:26.820 --> 08:25:28.820
Captain is the worst random?

08:25:28.820 --> 08:25:29.820
No.

08:25:30.820 --> 08:25:31.820
The sign which lady is,

08:25:31.820 --> 08:25:33.820
she never gives you anything good.

08:25:35.820 --> 08:25:36.820
Hail divers,

08:25:36.820 --> 08:25:37.820
mollo player.

08:25:37.820 --> 08:25:38.820
Is that easy to say at all?

08:25:45.820 --> 08:25:46.820
Well, sign which lady

08:25:46.820 --> 08:25:48.820
and quiz master already.

08:25:49.820 --> 08:25:50.820
Quiz master's rubbish,

08:25:50.820 --> 08:25:52.820
I don't like that one.

08:25:54.820 --> 08:25:55.820
Uh, for...

08:25:55.820 --> 08:25:57.820
Stroudy, please don't play Fortnite.

08:25:57.820 --> 08:25:58.820
Oh no, what's wrong?

08:26:00.820 --> 08:26:01.820
It's bad game.

08:26:01.820 --> 08:26:02.820
It's bad game.

08:26:05.820 --> 08:26:06.820
Get that steal,

08:26:06.820 --> 08:26:07.820
but yeah,

08:26:07.820 --> 08:26:08.820
I think it's kind of drop in,

08:26:08.820 --> 08:26:09.820
drop out.

08:26:10.820 --> 08:26:11.820
Um,

08:26:11.820 --> 08:26:13.820
I would like to play among us

08:26:13.820 --> 08:26:14.820
so I can start screaming at you,

08:26:14.820 --> 08:26:15.820
and I'll be like,

08:26:15.820 --> 08:26:16.820
it's red, it's red,

08:26:16.820 --> 08:26:17.820
wreathlings,

08:26:17.820 --> 08:26:18.820
you don't believe me,

08:26:18.820 --> 08:26:19.820
it's red.

08:26:22.820 --> 08:26:23.820
But we'll have to,

08:26:23.820 --> 08:26:25.820
we'll have to try it

08:26:25.820 --> 08:26:26.820
and see what happens.

08:26:31.820 --> 08:26:32.820
Okay, I'm done.

08:26:33.820 --> 08:26:34.820
I'm so, I'm so emoji.

08:26:34.820 --> 08:26:35.820
Look at me like,

08:26:35.820 --> 08:26:36.820
I'm literally hovering

08:26:36.820 --> 08:26:37.820
ready for the trade offer.

08:26:37.820 --> 08:26:38.820
Like, yeah, yeah,

08:26:38.820 --> 08:26:39.820
give me the trade offer.

08:26:39.820 --> 08:26:40.820
Oh, look, your problem now.

08:26:40.820 --> 08:26:41.820
There you go.

08:26:41.820 --> 08:26:42.820
Oh, your problem now.

08:26:45.820 --> 08:26:46.820
There you go.

08:26:46.820 --> 08:26:47.820
Oh, yours golden rings yours.

08:26:47.820 --> 08:26:48.820
Thank you for all the lobsters.

08:26:52.820 --> 08:26:53.820
Among us.

08:26:55.820 --> 08:26:57.820
You've never played among us?

08:26:57.820 --> 08:26:59.820
Deep Rock Galactica.

08:26:59.820 --> 08:27:01.820
We can play Deep Rock together.

08:27:02.820 --> 08:27:03.820
Can I force you guys

08:27:03.820 --> 08:27:05.820
to play that Mains of Moria game with me?

08:27:07.820 --> 08:27:09.820
I'm too scared to ask the girls to play

08:27:09.820 --> 08:27:11.820
in case they absolutely despise it.

08:27:11.820 --> 08:27:12.820
So,

08:27:12.820 --> 08:27:14.820
although I may be able to convince Sheebie.

08:27:17.820 --> 08:27:19.820
There's a Mains of Moria game.

08:27:19.820 --> 08:27:20.820
It's like,

08:27:20.820 --> 08:27:22.820
it's literally Deep Rock Galactica,

08:27:22.820 --> 08:27:23.820
but Lord of the Rings,

08:27:23.820 --> 08:27:24.820
Quidditch.

08:27:25.820 --> 08:27:26.820
You want to try Warframe.

08:27:26.820 --> 08:27:28.820
It's freeing up to four man squads.

08:27:28.820 --> 08:27:29.820
Ooh.

08:27:31.820 --> 08:27:32.820
I think you can force us

08:27:32.820 --> 08:27:33.820
to do anything you want to try.

08:27:40.820 --> 08:27:41.820
I haven't ever heard of it.

08:27:41.820 --> 08:27:42.820
I've never got advertised well.

08:27:42.820 --> 08:27:44.820
The only reason I've popped up for me

08:27:44.820 --> 08:27:46.820
is because I'm on Lord of the Rings

08:27:46.820 --> 08:27:47.820
side of TikTok.

08:27:48.820 --> 08:27:50.820
So, if there's anything Lord of the Rings,

08:27:50.820 --> 08:27:52.820
Lord of the Rings related.

08:27:53.820 --> 08:27:54.820
Oh my God, we're going to level up.

08:27:55.820 --> 08:27:58.820
40 freakin' seven.

08:27:59.820 --> 08:28:00.820
Oh my gosh.

08:28:02.820 --> 08:28:03.820
This is getting

08:28:03.820 --> 08:28:04.820
insane.

08:28:06.820 --> 08:28:07.820
Oh crap.

08:28:09.820 --> 08:28:10.820
Thank you.

08:28:10.820 --> 08:28:11.820
Thank you, Reflings.

08:28:12.820 --> 08:28:13.820
I appreciate it.

08:28:13.820 --> 08:28:14.820
Literally everyone feeding me.

08:28:14.820 --> 08:28:15.820
We're all like,

08:28:15.820 --> 08:28:16.820
fishing away, leveling up and stuff.

08:28:21.820 --> 08:28:23.820
I think we'll play

08:28:23.820 --> 08:28:25.820
RuneScape during,

08:28:26.820 --> 08:28:28.820
on the third week of streams,

08:28:28.820 --> 08:28:31.820
I think we might do a double RuneScape

08:28:31.820 --> 08:28:32.820
to make sure we really get there,

08:28:32.820 --> 08:28:33.820
XP-wise.

08:28:33.820 --> 08:28:35.820
I'll break it up in between the week

08:28:35.820 --> 08:28:37.820
just so it's not like a full day of RuneScape

08:28:37.820 --> 08:28:38.820
and then one right after it.

08:28:38.820 --> 08:28:40.820
Because I know RuneScape isn't for everyone.

08:28:40.820 --> 08:28:42.820
I know it might be a bit

08:28:42.820 --> 08:28:44.820
of a snooze fest,

08:28:44.820 --> 08:28:46.820
but for me it's so satisfying.

08:28:46.820 --> 08:28:48.820
Like, bigger number?

08:28:49.820 --> 08:28:50.820
Bigger number?

08:28:50.820 --> 08:28:51.820
Big number.

08:28:51.820 --> 08:28:52.820
Big number.

08:28:52.820 --> 08:28:55.820
Like, it's like really good for me.

08:28:55.820 --> 08:28:57.820
But I guess maybe watching it

08:28:57.820 --> 08:28:58.820
it might be better,

08:28:58.820 --> 08:28:59.820
like if it was a compilation

08:28:59.820 --> 08:29:01.820
or like a highlight, you know.

08:29:02.820 --> 08:29:03.820
Still do Warframe.

08:29:03.820 --> 08:29:05.820
It's the worst game to be a new player

08:29:05.820 --> 08:29:06.820
and 100% confusing

08:29:06.820 --> 08:29:07.820
and there's a neat tutorial.

08:29:07.820 --> 08:29:09.820
Deep Rock Season 5 is a bit

08:29:09.820 --> 08:29:10.820
of a horror show right now.

08:29:11.820 --> 08:29:12.820
What is it?

08:29:15.820 --> 08:29:16.820
Number go up.

08:29:19.820 --> 08:29:21.820
RuneScape is definitely a talking stream,

08:29:21.820 --> 08:29:23.820
like a datzu, like back and forth.

08:29:23.820 --> 08:29:25.820
I like meme-ing with one of each other.

08:29:26.820 --> 08:29:28.820
I'm like learning about the game and stuff.

08:29:30.820 --> 08:29:32.820
I don't know enough about RuneScape.

08:29:32.820 --> 08:29:34.820
Literally, I was in kindergarten when I said

08:29:34.820 --> 08:29:37.820
the best I did as a kid was do cooking

08:29:37.820 --> 08:29:39.820
and then probably do 40

08:29:39.820 --> 08:29:40.820
and then that's the best.

08:29:40.820 --> 08:29:42.820
I actually don't know how the game works.

08:29:43.820 --> 08:29:45.820
So much lobster.

08:29:45.820 --> 08:29:46.820
Rock lobster.

08:29:51.820 --> 08:29:53.820
Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

08:29:58.820 --> 08:30:00.820
Uh, b52 is anyone?

08:30:04.820 --> 08:30:07.820
The Reflane is,

08:30:07.820 --> 08:30:09.820
could you trouble you to play

08:30:09.820 --> 08:30:11.820
Voices of the Void?

08:30:11.820 --> 08:30:12.820
I don't know what that is.

08:30:12.820 --> 08:30:13.820
Is it an MMO?

08:30:13.820 --> 08:30:15.820
Or like single?

08:30:16.820 --> 08:30:17.820
Or what?

08:30:17.820 --> 08:30:18.820
What kind of game?

08:30:18.820 --> 08:30:31.640
game. This review thing is a deep one. Final Fantasy 14. I was gonna give it a shot but

08:30:31.640 --> 08:30:41.180
yeah. I never ended up playing it. I don't know if they say they roleplay a lot in it.

08:30:41.180 --> 08:30:48.180
Honestly, I don't mind. It'll be fun to roleplay.

08:30:48.180 --> 08:30:59.180
A roleplay is what though. I don't know what a roleplay is. I've had a choice to roleplay something.

08:30:59.180 --> 08:31:18.180
I don't know. Save Heroes is free to play. Super hero animal. Oh, I think I said I wanted

08:31:18.180 --> 08:31:26.620
to play Marvel Rivals. We might play that but I don't know if it's in beta or if that's

08:31:26.620 --> 08:31:32.900
it fully out. I don't know. Oh, my tummy's wobbling. I don't know what to do.

08:31:32.900 --> 08:31:40.860
Strony and her 100 husbands. Isn't this the life though? You know, you have to wait to

08:31:40.860 --> 08:31:47.140
get your one-on-one attention but then that makes it so much more worth it. Why do I keep

08:31:47.140 --> 08:31:56.740
fricking snail blinking? I'm gonna have to change that. Please stop blinking one at a time.

08:31:56.740 --> 08:32:09.260
I'm gonna have to make the sensitivity different. Any trenches in trying Lord of the Rings online?

08:32:09.260 --> 08:32:15.940
Like Shadow of the Rings online? You mean Elden Scrolls online? Or is there like a Lord

08:32:15.940 --> 08:32:23.340
of the Rings online I have no idea about? I'm actually playing Final Fantasy while watching

08:32:23.340 --> 08:32:30.060
the stream. Speaking of fact, cannot decide. I work in accounting and I'm the only guy

08:32:30.060 --> 08:32:35.780
with nine girls in the office. Hey, what a ladies man. Check it out. You get a nice view

08:32:35.780 --> 08:32:43.820
all day long. There's a Lord of the Rings. Maybe I've seen it and I'm just being a dum-dum.

08:32:43.820 --> 08:32:54.220
I can't recall it off the toilet in the head. Should I move? I feel like I'm like in the

08:32:54.220 --> 08:33:02.380
way here. Oh, I can't even access the fire. Oh, I can't even access the fire though. Dum-dum.

08:33:02.380 --> 08:33:07.420
Oops, sorry. I'm already accepted. It's pretty old. Does Lord of the Rings online still even

08:33:07.420 --> 08:33:13.300
have server? Yeah, I don't even think I've seen any gameplay of it. Unless I have in

08:33:13.420 --> 08:33:19.460
my brains just not putting them two together. 171 successful cooks to go. Not sure how many

08:33:19.460 --> 08:33:28.420
could in burnings, so probably ten more traps. Wow. We're at 81,000 XP on cooking. We need

08:33:28.420 --> 08:33:41.500
20k more when it's mercy. 20 minutes on mercy. I don't know. If we could stop burning. There's

08:33:41.580 --> 08:33:45.260
no way you're still headbanging over there. Are you not tired of clicking the button?

08:33:48.060 --> 08:33:53.100
Brightly Lord of the Rings is microtransaction to heck. Okay, that's probably why I haven't

08:33:53.100 --> 08:34:00.140
heard about it because everyone just saw how much of a grab it was. I lost my little face. Yeah,

08:34:00.140 --> 08:34:08.460
maybe I am. Maybe I'm just headbanging. I mean, barbed village is a thing. Yeah, we might maybe

08:34:08.460 --> 08:34:20.540
do a watch along of stuff for the later levels. Oh, 48, man. That's so good. Literally, I was aiming

08:34:20.540 --> 08:34:26.140
for 40, and I'm so happy with what we've got. Obviously, special shout out to the reflins who

08:34:26.140 --> 08:34:32.700
are supplying a ridiculous amount of money and fish and everything to me because it is insane.

08:34:32.700 --> 08:34:39.660
And literally, the reflins down here that are just chilling and fishing away, they're just having

08:34:39.660 --> 08:34:45.740
a good time leveling up fishing. What are your fishing levels? Hold on, let me type. Fishing

08:34:45.740 --> 08:34:56.700
level check. Fishing level check. I'm still struggling early game fishing and cooking

08:34:56.700 --> 08:35:02.540
so the lumberjoo shrimp, it takes forever to net some shrimp and then you burn them to heck.

08:35:03.100 --> 08:35:07.340
If you guys want to catch up to her, I'll give you what I have left after stream.

08:35:10.140 --> 08:35:17.740
Out of curiosity, are you avoiding profanity for any reason? A little bit. The AI can tell,

08:35:17.740 --> 08:35:23.100
like the AI can read what my voice is, so I kind of try and swap out words over time

08:35:23.660 --> 08:35:29.980
because I am quite outrageous at certain sections, so I try and tone it down as long

08:35:29.980 --> 08:35:36.700
as you get a good 80-20 mix, then overall you're fine, which is why I swap out words sometimes.

08:35:39.340 --> 08:35:42.220
I have enough eggs to be for night night twice, unfortunately.

08:35:42.540 --> 08:35:49.820
A little refling's cute surprise of the stream. Oh, we keep burning them.

08:35:52.940 --> 08:35:59.180
Oh lobbies, you're not as easy to cook as I thought. My little, my caviar.

08:35:59.180 --> 08:36:12.860
But yes, I maybe need to think of, like, maybe we watch movies whilst we runescape

08:36:12.860 --> 08:36:16.940
in the background or something. I mean, I can do a set of watch one movie,

08:36:18.140 --> 08:36:22.780
obviously I can't show it, but I can show the timer so as we jump in at any point.

08:36:23.340 --> 08:36:25.980
Maybe Harry Potter, do you guys like Harry Potter?

08:36:28.620 --> 08:36:36.060
I've watched it through for the first time, a couple years back, I've not seen the full thing.

08:36:36.060 --> 08:36:39.580
Not particularly, okay, maybe not, sorry, sorry, maybe not, maybe it's a girl's movie. Apologies.

08:36:41.580 --> 08:36:48.780
Is there a C- John Wick series? We'll watch the John Wick series movies, that would be a good one.

08:36:49.340 --> 08:36:57.580
I think everyone who's ready for RuneScape and Chill, honestly, John Wick RuneScape and Chill,

08:36:58.780 --> 08:37:03.260
I'll put down the sound of the game like really low and we'll just watch the movie.

08:37:03.260 --> 08:37:08.300
And it's just me going, in the movie, and then every time I level up I also go,

08:37:11.180 --> 08:37:14.460
the first three movies of Harry Potter is pretty comfortable. Yeah, I guess really

08:37:14.540 --> 08:37:19.500
dark at the end, which I don't. You could do a pool on which movies, yeah.

08:37:21.660 --> 08:37:28.860
Just because of how long, like the grains are, I would kind of want to do series movies and

08:37:32.620 --> 08:37:37.420
John Wick has three installments, I'm pretty sure, which is why I quite like that.

08:37:38.380 --> 08:37:49.180
What about Shrek? Oh, I don't like the later Shrek. Is it Shrek happily ever after?

08:37:55.020 --> 08:37:56.140
John Wick has four?

08:37:59.580 --> 08:38:04.140
Have I seen the fourth one? I might know you haven't seen the fourth one. I don't know,

08:38:04.140 --> 08:38:13.580
there's a fourth installment. Huh. I have a silly idea. What's your idea? Hmm, you have me curious.

08:38:13.580 --> 08:38:19.340
Speak your truth. Stroney, how do you feel about Spider-Man movies? You want to watch the original

08:38:19.340 --> 08:38:25.820
Spider-Man? Like the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man? So we can all have a gig a lot of the dancing.

08:38:26.780 --> 08:38:35.100
Hmm. Tobey Maguire is a must, I don't know. I remember like a freaking babbling and watching the

08:38:35.100 --> 08:38:42.940
movies practically. Yeah, the fourth, the final chapter is the fourth. Okay, okay, okay.

08:38:45.420 --> 08:38:49.980
Stroney, did you know that Lord of the Rings trilogy lasts less than one of your endurance

08:38:50.060 --> 08:38:56.060
streams? I'm saving myself. I'm saving myself for the Lord of the Rings on Christmas Day.

08:38:56.620 --> 08:39:04.780
I am abstaining from such beautiful literature, such beautiful media that was created for human

08:39:04.780 --> 08:39:18.220
consumption. So we're not going to watch them for this. The Sam Remy trilogy. Yes, Spider-Man 3.

08:39:19.020 --> 08:39:23.900
I don't think I saw that one. I didn't see any of the Spider-Man's that have Emma Stone in it.

08:39:27.180 --> 08:39:32.220
But I watched Spider-Man. We're all three of them were in the same movie.

08:39:34.380 --> 08:39:39.020
And Tobey was like, yeah, it just comes out of my wrist. And the other two were like, huh?

08:39:40.300 --> 08:39:45.980
Because I couldn't believe it. Because I think the new, oh, I'm really bad with people's names.

08:39:45.980 --> 08:39:51.020
The new Spider-Man has to use nanotechnology from Iron Man to get his gunk out.

08:39:53.340 --> 08:39:59.900
I don't know what Garth feels. Honestly, any of the Spider-Man movies, the movies are great. Okay.

08:40:01.660 --> 08:40:11.260
49. Oh my gosh, 49 just popped. Feels good, man. Tom Holland. Ah, his name's Tom Holland.

08:40:16.940 --> 08:40:21.740
I sing the praises of the apocrity diary for anyone who wants them. Is it a movie?

08:40:23.260 --> 08:40:28.460
I'm not heard of it. Is it a game or a movie?

08:40:33.740 --> 08:40:41.900
Oh, my tummy's so hungry. But I can't make food. I must grind. I must fish max. We are fish maxing.

08:40:42.540 --> 08:40:52.860
We hitting 50 before Mercy. Before, I think so. We are like blasting through these levels. It's crazy.

08:40:55.180 --> 08:41:05.020
0.7% of the weight of 99. Let's go. Oh, I read apocrity novel. Aren't there like seven Highlander

08:41:05.020 --> 08:41:16.700
movies? It's Mad Max, a one-off movie. I think so. That new Mad Max, I think is good. The one that

08:41:16.700 --> 08:41:24.860
was like, witness me, and he put spray can on his teeth. That one was pretty good. Those one-off

08:41:24.860 --> 08:41:30.460
movies are... Oh, sorry. I just clicked. I misclicked. Oh, sorry, sorry. The grind. The grind, please.

08:41:30.460 --> 08:41:35.420
The lobster maxing. I can't do it if I'm not misclicking. It was a misinput, misinput.

08:41:36.460 --> 08:41:43.740
Fury Road was one. XP waste. No, don't bully me over my XP wasting.

08:41:46.060 --> 08:41:52.700
It says I need 54 cooks, and I've got level 50. If I can stop burning them, maybe two more

08:41:52.700 --> 08:41:57.820
inventories of lobbies. Oh, maybe two. We can do it in two.

08:42:01.740 --> 08:42:10.860
Where are... If only I knew how many hours I spent bank standing. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

08:42:13.340 --> 08:42:19.420
I think your ping may be blessed, possibly. Get that fire on. Get that fire on. Get that lobby on the

08:42:19.420 --> 08:42:27.900
fire. Not the misinput. Blade Runner? Ooh, that's a good suggestion.

08:42:31.660 --> 08:42:39.020
I thought about because of the Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling. I don't know why that was so hard to

08:42:39.020 --> 08:42:44.380
say Ryan. Because of the Ryan Gosling movies, I thought it would be funny if we did like a six

08:42:44.460 --> 08:42:50.860
girl watch along of it, like all six of us watching it. And then whenever Ryan comes on screen,

08:42:50.860 --> 08:42:55.340
all of us can be like, oh, that's literally my refling. That's literally my like,

08:42:55.340 --> 08:42:58.700
bleeding heart. That's literally my snippet. That's literally my pinpal.

08:43:02.860 --> 08:43:10.780
I'm on world 380 at Barbarian Village. Unfortunately, I'm literally about to go off in 13 minutes.

08:43:11.100 --> 08:43:16.700
Because Mercy's coming online. And literally, oh my god, that's my refling. Oh my god, my refling's

08:43:16.700 --> 08:43:20.780
so strong. I'm gonna just be like complimenting you the entire stream.

08:43:25.180 --> 08:43:29.900
Okay, it says 34 more lobsters. Okay, this time, two more inventories. I'll do it.

08:43:30.460 --> 08:43:32.540
Can't stop burning these lobbies.

08:43:33.100 --> 08:43:33.900
Wow.

08:43:37.980 --> 08:43:43.900
That Gosling, literally. I wouldn't mind rewatching The Blade Runner because I didn't like fully

08:43:43.900 --> 08:43:52.940
comprehend it at first. So it'd be nice to like see it again, kind of mildly knowing what happens.

08:43:53.580 --> 08:43:59.180
Have you watched Seven Cycle Path? Movie before? No, I haven't. I'm not sure what that is. That

08:43:59.180 --> 08:44:07.580
Gosling, literally. Can't wait to see us all together again. Can't wait as well.

08:44:07.580 --> 08:44:11.580
We've got our first group collab, and then we've got our one-on-one collab coming out soon again.

08:44:14.940 --> 08:44:18.700
So I'm gonna see. Can I please stop burning these lobbies, please?

08:44:30.140 --> 08:44:38.140
I think I can do it. But yes. I think I said a little bit before, we're a little bit limited

08:44:38.140 --> 08:44:43.740
on multiplayer games that we can all play together, so I think I will encourage like some

08:44:43.740 --> 08:44:56.860
trio collabs or quad man collabs at some point, but it'll be fun to see everyone's like dynamic

08:44:56.940 --> 08:45:00.060
with each other. I hope no one's scared of me.

08:45:00.860 --> 08:45:08.620
Strawny smells, how dare you? How do your accusations? I smell like burnt lobster, burnt

08:45:08.620 --> 08:45:16.140
shrimp, burnt trout, burnt salmon, burnt pike. I smell like burnt everything because I can't stop

08:45:16.140 --> 08:45:22.620
freaking messing up. I need to kick 13 lobsters in the snatch and I level up, and I burn three in a

08:45:22.620 --> 08:45:31.340
row, of course, when I say that. Four in a row! That's more like it. Trying to upset me video game,

08:45:32.460 --> 08:45:37.020
it's working. I saw the fish she's handling, so sniff the stuff.

08:45:39.100 --> 08:45:44.140
Looking forward to main crash shenanigans. Yeah, that's in July. July shenanigans.

08:45:45.100 --> 08:45:53.180
I'm not beating the front end. Eating Strawny's burnt food sign me up. Oh, no, those are carcinogenic.

08:45:53.180 --> 08:46:00.380
You're not supposed to eat burnt any kind of food. Wait, why did she smell like fish? We're the ones

08:46:00.380 --> 08:46:09.660
who are questioning. We did it! We're 50! We actually did it, no way. Mercy's up in 10.

08:46:10.620 --> 08:46:19.340
No, we've got 50. That's insane. Thank you so much, we've got 50.

08:46:23.260 --> 08:46:27.420
And that was like messing about questing as well and all that.

08:46:28.060 --> 08:46:40.300
I look forward to less burning. M-A-B-Zoo, congrats. Honestly, I hope I'll stop burning.

08:46:40.300 --> 08:46:52.620
Oh my god, I'm so MLG pro at cutting fish. Ah! I'll send the crunch.

08:46:53.260 --> 08:46:57.820
It says the value is 2.3k for that batch of lobsters?

08:46:59.900 --> 08:47:01.900
I thought lobsters were a money maker.

08:47:06.060 --> 08:47:13.500
Okay, well, I hope to see you play old school again. Yeah, we'll play it once next week on week two

08:47:13.500 --> 08:47:20.220
and then we'll play it twice on week three during the week, but I'll split it up just in case

08:47:20.220 --> 08:47:25.420
because I don't know. RuneScape isn't the most interesting. Not anymore with all the bots.

08:47:28.140 --> 08:47:33.820
Maybe the bots aren't so bad after all. Controversion. You can't say that. You can't say that.

08:47:36.060 --> 08:47:39.020
They wear a really long time ago. I'm wondering if that's what I remember.

08:47:41.740 --> 08:47:48.860
Bots keep the lobsters cheap. I'm wondering how the economy in RuneScape would look

08:47:48.940 --> 08:47:56.380
if bots were like completely forbidden, like if they managed to like completely eradicate them.

08:47:57.900 --> 08:48:02.940
I'm wondering if it would be an uproar because everything would get so expensive, you know?

08:48:05.260 --> 08:48:06.620
Curious, curious.

08:48:12.700 --> 08:48:14.380
We're learning, we're learning.

08:48:15.340 --> 08:48:20.220
Stony, Iron Man win. Oh, good luck with that. Are you joking?

08:48:22.220 --> 08:48:29.980
It's hardcore Iron Man. You can't use bank. Iron Man is what? You lose everything when you perish?

08:48:32.220 --> 08:48:36.380
Sorry, I'm probably standing on everyone right now.

08:48:37.100 --> 08:48:46.940
I feel like it would probably like been working on a mech and AC6 for whatever you get on it.

08:48:49.660 --> 08:48:52.940
Ultimate Iron Man, no bank, hardcore, lose stats when that. Yeah.

08:48:56.060 --> 08:49:04.620
Are you serious? Do you know how much money I've made today? That's 20 million. No way I've been

08:49:04.620 --> 08:49:15.900
given 20 million. Hello? Don't people like spend like actual real-world currency to get this kind

08:49:15.900 --> 08:49:22.220
of going? Gold and coin together is going just like you should know. I'm putting this in the bank.

08:49:22.220 --> 08:49:27.020
Wait, you said there was a bank up here. Hold on. Hold on, mommy's going to the bank. She'll be back

08:49:27.020 --> 08:49:32.140
in a second. There's a bank up here? Is that one of these buildings? That looks like a ruined building.

08:49:34.860 --> 08:49:38.220
Oh, I'm getting scared. I hope I don't get attacked. You have what level are you people?

08:49:38.860 --> 08:49:45.420
Identify yourselves. Okay, no, I must be off of it. Oh, wait, wait, I see banker booth. We found it.

08:49:46.300 --> 08:49:49.660
We're finally in Edgeville. This is where I was born.

08:49:51.980 --> 08:49:56.540
Right, let's get this money nice and safe and tidy in here because oh my gosh.

08:49:57.500 --> 08:50:01.500
Hey, leather gloves. Can I put that on? Is that going to like add to my defense?

08:50:02.140 --> 08:50:08.620
Oh my gosh, leather gloves. That's what I needed. Oh, I'll check it out. Oh my god, I'm starting.

08:50:10.860 --> 08:50:15.020
Whoa, that's right. Whoa, the bend of my arm is amazing.

08:50:19.100 --> 08:50:24.460
We did it. We did it. All right, let me come back briefly. No, don't cry. Don't cry. Look over and

08:50:24.460 --> 08:50:29.340
you're crying. No, don't cry. I'm right here. I'm just stunning on the bank because I'm really scared.

08:50:30.300 --> 08:50:34.060
I didn't even know there was a freaking thing up there. Well, now I know there's a bank up there.

08:50:34.060 --> 08:50:42.300
I am expanding my runescape knowledge. Wow, okay, okay, we're here. I think I might need to...

08:50:44.860 --> 08:50:49.180
Can I get level 51? Whoa, wait a minute. Can I even cook these?

08:50:51.660 --> 08:50:53.020
Can I cook swordfish?

08:50:53.020 --> 08:51:01.580
Oh, I can. What did they get? Oh, burnt it. 140.

08:51:04.140 --> 08:51:07.660
It says I have to cook 56 swordfish to already level up again.

08:51:08.620 --> 08:51:14.780
Wait, it's taking down two? It's just 50. It's literally going down by two. 48.

08:51:15.180 --> 08:51:26.540
47. Wait, what? I'm going crazy. Is that a chef hat? It is. It's a golden chef hat and a golden apron.

08:51:26.540 --> 08:51:28.540
A refling literally gave me it.

08:51:34.300 --> 08:51:35.580
Oh, I just started doing something.

08:51:37.980 --> 08:51:42.140
You should be able to buy enough materials for 99 cooking with five million coins alone.

08:51:42.700 --> 08:51:47.260
I've got, well, I've got 20. We might as well go fletching while we're at it. Will we do crafting?

08:51:49.020 --> 08:51:52.780
Jeez. Not me becoming a runescape player overnight.

08:51:54.940 --> 08:52:01.900
Like a runescape skillar, sorry. Oh my goodness, that swordfish is insane.

08:52:01.900 --> 08:52:07.660
We're at 31. Yeah, it's like recalculating, as you guys see. It's trying to do the math, but oof.

08:52:07.820 --> 08:52:09.820
That's insane.

08:52:12.140 --> 08:52:16.140
How much is it on the ground? For swordfish, it's 4k for that lot.

08:52:16.700 --> 08:52:18.700
It just seems like a shame that I'm kind of wasting that vote.

08:52:20.060 --> 08:52:24.460
Oh, even more. Goodbye, those who have to go.

08:52:25.500 --> 08:52:30.780
Yes, please don't worry if you have to go now. I'm about to read in some mercy to give myself a

08:52:30.780 --> 08:52:37.020
vocal rest before I do ASMR, I believe, tomorrow. And then it's the sweet stream.

08:52:37.900 --> 08:52:42.780
Yes. So please don't worry if you have to go. I'm literally just cooking away

08:52:44.300 --> 08:52:49.820
an experience in swordfish XT. I sent for Scottish anime women.

08:52:51.900 --> 08:52:54.860
Thanks for something for me. I sent for replays.

08:52:57.100 --> 08:53:03.900
Unfathomable progress, honestly. Oh yeah, buy out those stats. Yeah, we're going to get it.

08:53:08.300 --> 08:53:14.060
Rest well, rest well. I also shrimped for her. Oh yeah, you shrimped for me because I'm a

08:53:14.060 --> 08:53:19.900
mesipish. I'm a sea animal, so you shrimped for me. And we're head banging away.

08:53:28.540 --> 08:53:33.740
I'll wait the ride. I'll ask Mercy to put bad jokes written all over your new clothes design.

08:53:33.740 --> 08:53:37.660
I'm so curious what she comes up with, like so, so curious.

08:53:39.740 --> 08:53:48.300
Oh my god, we're 110 KXP for cooking. That's just amazing.

08:53:51.820 --> 08:53:55.180
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. And there's more where it came from.

08:53:55.660 --> 08:54:01.500
Not going to lie, I'd be part of that army if I played RuneScape at all.

08:54:03.100 --> 08:54:07.580
Someone was like, oh yeah, start up a guild. And I'm like, I've never done it. I don't even know how to do it.

08:54:09.580 --> 08:54:15.340
Well, we'll just play as free agents, if you will. We're free agents. Free refling.

08:54:15.820 --> 08:54:23.580
We sent for each other a circling of scents, if you will.

08:54:24.940 --> 08:54:29.740
Shrimping hard. The amount of progress is only possible with an army of shrimps.

08:54:30.540 --> 08:54:34.780
My little shrimpers. Oh fine, I guess you are my little shrimpers.

08:54:35.580 --> 08:54:43.900
Don't guild members get XP boosts, do they? What for, like, raids?

08:54:46.060 --> 08:54:50.860
Like streams to help Algo. Watch Mercy and RuneScape schedule. Yeah!

08:54:53.340 --> 08:55:01.180
51 on day one, 51. That is an insane progress.

08:55:01.500 --> 08:55:07.900
Insane. Day one, level 51.

08:55:07.900 --> 08:55:11.420
Bruh. Bruh. Bruh.

08:55:13.260 --> 08:55:18.220
And that's with doing, like, free quests and stuff together.

08:55:19.500 --> 08:55:23.820
I'm wondering if we, like, just, just, just, just, just sent it.

08:55:24.780 --> 08:55:26.380
But we just sent it.

08:55:27.740 --> 08:55:30.140
Wait, you're both doing swordfish as well?

08:55:31.980 --> 08:55:35.740
You guys said, nah, lobbies isn't enough. We've had enough of lobsters.

08:55:35.740 --> 08:55:39.020
You're gonna, you're gonna just sell them on? You're gonna sell them back into the,

08:55:39.020 --> 08:55:40.620
the grand exchange economy?

08:55:44.780 --> 08:55:49.500
We don't need sleep when we have, oh, I hope you guys are sleeping well. We got you, literally.

08:55:50.460 --> 08:55:53.740
I hope you guys are sleeping well. I've had a few days without sleeping.

08:55:53.740 --> 08:55:55.340
Okay, it's rough. I guess it's dangerous.

08:55:57.980 --> 08:55:58.780
Hydration check.

08:56:02.060 --> 08:56:04.540
It's 1pm. Uh, is Mercy on?

08:56:06.300 --> 08:56:08.940
Wait, hold on. I'm gonna need to make sure I'm redirecting.

08:56:10.380 --> 08:56:12.700
Hold on, Strony. Oh, no, no, no.

08:56:13.340 --> 08:56:16.620
No, Mercy. No, this future channel, I need the link.

08:56:20.860 --> 08:56:23.820
Nope, that was her yesterday stream. Don't be silly, Billy.

08:56:25.740 --> 08:56:30.300
What? Oh, she's not live yet. It's like, upcoming. Oh, don't wait, 100 and 0.

08:56:30.940 --> 08:56:31.420
Oh wait, I'll wait in.

08:56:35.180 --> 08:56:37.980
She's, I'll wait until she's live to confirm the redirect.

08:56:42.700 --> 08:56:50.080
I'll wait until she's live to put the oh she's literally just went live no way

08:56:51.680 --> 08:56:57.680
That was so that's such good timing hold on let me let's do it. What if we just kept cooking

08:56:59.480 --> 08:57:01.480
I don't know

08:57:06.440 --> 08:57:08.440
I don't know

08:57:08.800 --> 08:57:12.240
My voice is scoffed like it's scoffed the unbelief I can't

08:57:15.240 --> 08:57:17.240
I kind of want to rest for days more

08:57:18.440 --> 08:57:22.720
Is there going to be any scripts? Are you doing freestyle? I might do some scripted stuff

08:57:23.520 --> 08:57:25.520
like at the start or like

08:57:26.160 --> 08:57:28.160
freezes or certainly paragraphs

08:57:28.840 --> 08:57:30.120
and

08:57:30.120 --> 08:57:34.040
This woman needs to rest her voice don't encourage her bad habits Lamal

08:57:34.680 --> 08:57:38.160
Right, let me make sure I'm redirecting into the stream

08:57:38.640 --> 08:57:47.100
No, I'm going to make the big boy decision and rest my voice as much as it pains me

08:57:48.560 --> 08:57:52.800
Because I do want it lobster. It's sorry. I want a swordfish max

08:57:57.080 --> 08:57:59.080
Okay

08:58:03.280 --> 08:58:06.800
Okay, she's still loading so I have stalling time okay

08:58:07.800 --> 08:58:11.160
She's still loading in the loading screen so I can still

08:58:13.400 --> 08:58:15.400
They'll never know

08:58:16.280 --> 08:58:22.000
They'll never know we're gonna just want more just one more inventory of fish. Okay, just one more one more, please

08:58:22.200 --> 08:58:25.760
Just one more just one more. Okay. I'll be good. I'll be a good girl

08:58:28.120 --> 08:58:30.120
Please come on my knees

08:58:30.560 --> 08:58:32.560
Just one more inventory though

08:58:32.560 --> 08:58:36.900
We'll see how much xp we can get I'll be beautiful. I mean won't be so close to 52

08:58:42.900 --> 08:58:47.240
Are you gonna do the M&M goodbye, what's the M&M goodbye?

08:58:50.560 --> 08:58:53.800
Well even Scottish M&M again M&M again

08:58:54.320 --> 08:58:56.320
I

08:58:56.640 --> 08:59:01.160
Starting to nod off to that fishing myself. He's a few more minutes of swordfish maximum

08:59:01.160 --> 08:59:05.920
Just one more just one more inventory, please. I'm not addicted. I promise just one more inventory full of fishes

08:59:06.760 --> 08:59:08.760
Let's do it

08:59:09.600 --> 08:59:16.320
What's the M&M thing? A lot of burnt one. Look, I'm trying my best. Okay. It's hard to cook over the fire

08:59:16.680 --> 08:59:21.880
There's so the wind keeps blowing in different directions and people keep moving around the fire

08:59:21.880 --> 08:59:25.520
So the air flow isn't really doing it. Don't supply her addiction

08:59:28.400 --> 08:59:35.640
Get rest or anyone that beautiful acts in the top form. Yes, I will warn and say that ASMR streams are a

08:59:36.240 --> 08:59:38.240
lot shorter

08:59:38.640 --> 08:59:41.320
But I'll definitely be looking at marshmallows

08:59:41.320 --> 08:59:46.840
I'll definitely be looking at some scripted stuff and you can always submit what you want to say as well

08:59:46.840 --> 08:59:49.840

There's no harm in one more batch of swordfish

09:00:37.960 --> 09:00:40.560
No way you're not giving me it

I can go offline whenever I want. Okay

09:02:04.680 --> 09:02:08.400
Will you expect brief will you accept briefings instead of fish?

09:02:10.160 --> 09:02:12.160
Depends what my lead to do with you. Huh?

I have a pump in the ground who got to pump it up. You've got to know there's no fish on the ground

Oh, I'm so glad you managed to join in on the quest. We'll definitely do quest next time as well
