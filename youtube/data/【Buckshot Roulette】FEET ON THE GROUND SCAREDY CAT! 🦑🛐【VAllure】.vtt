WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
No time to wait for my days, we're getting longer in peace

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
No time to wait for my days, of all the time

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Right, this is British lore

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh wait, hold on

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
Dule Lover, thank you for becoming a member, I have no idea what it's like even says I'm online yet

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
No it doesn't, oh this is the thing, whenever I look back on a board

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
I'm like rambling to myself for a full minute, because for some reason it doesn't bring itself up for a full minute

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Even though I'm sitting here, meh meh meh, but when I look back on the board

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
And all that, it's all fine

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It's all fine

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
The fine line

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Right, where are we? Nope

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Nope, not yet

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Not playing the game yet

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, I am your host, Ronnie Cuttles

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Coming at you with a fried voice, thank you

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Dule Lover becoming a member in case that did not register

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
She loves it, she loves it

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
On time question mark, yes I haven't been lurking in the shadows

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
I had to do some bit of background work

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
What's the background work you ask?

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
I put Shabby Cottonbombs memberships live, so if you want to be a cheeky harem and get in

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
But she might not say your name during the stream though

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
You're probably better waiting on the stream in two hours time

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
Shabby Cottonbombs, maybe I should be a bit bigger, can I talk in a minute?

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm looking and looking

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Well I'll just stand right here, like right over the text and everything

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Why not? Why not? Why do I have to be professional?

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Hold on, I'll actually go weave, because BOOM!

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, little reeflings

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
What is on the agendination for week three?

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
So we're starting off strong with an ASMR stream at the usual time

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
And then after two hours I will go offline and have a 15 minute peace break

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Because we're going to be doing our first membership watch-along

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
Which is none other than the first Transformers movie with Sam Witwicky and Bumblebee

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Sweet little Bumblebee, I know what he wants from me

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
To kill the Decepticon and stop them from ruining the planet

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
And then the following day, on a Tuesday for the rest of the world

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
We are playing Zelda Minish Cap

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Now statistically this game takes roughly eight hours to finish

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Whether or not it takes me eight hours, I don't know

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
But we will be taking a pause 15 minutes before because for a member stream

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
We're going to be doing the forbidden tear list

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Not the way you want, the big yin

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
And I get to answer it honestly this time

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Because I'm allowed to say what I want to say

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
If we do not finish it in the first day, which is unlikely due to the member stream

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
Then the rest of the day on Wednesday is dedicated to Zelda Minish Cap

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
But it's the only Zelda game I have ever completed or played

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I know it's shocking, hold on, wait

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Whoa, it won't let me stretch out chat

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Chat, you'd let me stretch it

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Why the frick frack diddly-dat-tick-tack?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Does it not let me stretch chat?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Wait, is it because I normally have you on the screen?

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Oh my god, let me stretch you, why is it locked?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Chat is locked for me, so I can't even read just properly

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Brev, Brev

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I'm trying to explain what we're doing

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Anyway, I'm going to-

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Eh, you be next, thank you for becoming a member

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Oh my god, is that the mascot for, um, we Louie Vuitton Inc?

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm so sorry, her name evades me right now from all the live, Louie Vuitton Inc

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Oh my god, why is her name not in my mouth?

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
Purple, with the most adorable little sea ears

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Oh my goodness

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Anyway

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Um, we are going to do Old School RuneScape on Thursday

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Oh, and now my chat's broken completely

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh, thanks OBS, no really, thank you, please don't ever cook again

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Oh, it finally worked, in on, yes, in on

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh my goodness, I don't know why chat wasn't working

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Chat, yeah, well it's fixed, I can actually read chat now

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
In on, yes, in on, in my whole, thank you

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Um, let's see, so then we're going to do Old School RuneScape

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
However, check it, I'm doing my first ever one-on-one collab with the other girl

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
And guess what, it's with Mercy

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I should have picked any kind of yandere

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
But I got Mercy

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And we're going to be playing Goose Game, we're going to be playing it at her time

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So we're only going to do a little bit of RuneScape

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
But if I can get a couple of levels in, I will take it

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Um, so a couple hours of RuneScape and blabbing away

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And then I will go offline for a few hours to recharge

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Because I want to give Mercy my all, she's not ready for the Rotism Your Honor

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Hey, thank you, Omarum Simpson

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
It still doesn't display properly, even though I have the full chat up

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Memberships are showing up for me on YouTube mobile

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
For a sheebie cotton bum, they better be because we are redirecting into her

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
If you didn't know, sheebie has posted pictures of herself in a self-made cosplay of sheebie

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Yep, that's a full sentence

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You may check them out by discovering the alternative twirers

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
If you don't know what the alternative twirers are, feel free to check out who the accounts are following

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
But yes, at Mercy's usual stream time, I wanted to make the collab super easy for her

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
So I am going to have to rest and snort

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Some...

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I shouldn't have said that

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm going to be taking lots of cola, okay

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm going to be slurping my cola for any caffeination

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Because I'm probably going to be a wee bit

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I'm going to start lagging a little bit there

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Ain't I meant for you either

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You don't have to give me money to tell me this

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
You just realise that, Omarum

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
You don't have to give me money to type things in chat

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Scotland, whatever

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Yes, erm

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, I was originally going to do a heart rate monitor this stream

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Count up for the life of me, find it

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I bought a new heart rate monitor because my other one was bust

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
And it's already gone

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So I think I'm about to purchase a third one

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Lucky me

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
I'll probably...

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
If I send a care package to the girls like for Donothons

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Others have cubed mascots

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
We have a cubed Scottish girl

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
What?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Wait

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Did Brian talk?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Did Brian say...

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
No, did Brian say anything there?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh shit, I didn't see that

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Aren't...

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Others have cubed mascots

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
We have a cubed Scottish girl

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Thank you for the five iron report

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I appreciate it

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Oh, I never heard that

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Sorry, I have my headset muted

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Because I have the freaking game sound in the background

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
It's so loud

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Can't wait to see Strone as the imposter in this game

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Wait, what?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
No, wait

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
We're playing Nero

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
We're playing a game called Untitled Kiss Game

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
If you didn't see AC actually revealed that she's playing with Emmy

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
On a game called Don't Starve

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
And I'm like, jeez, that's a bit brutal

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
That's exactly AC's lore

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Because she had to hunt for her food

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So, rather curious

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Rather curious, aren't they?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Okay

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
What else? Elden...

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Yes, Elden Ring the DLC

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Elden Ring the DLC, okay

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It launches on Friday

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm like 99% sure

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Even if it doesn't come out by the time we start playing

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
We have a lot of areas to clear anyway

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And I am under the impression

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
We have to perish the enemy

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
That's at the top of this elevator

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
In that graveyard

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
And ironically Ryan Goslin was the one

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
That vanquished him

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Because I couldn't do it

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I kept getting attacked

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
So the reflands on a freaking debuff

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Like a severe debuff

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Whilst I was running away from this boss

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
All came flying in

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And I'm like 99% sure

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Ryan Goslin killed that one

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
I do say shortcaller

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Now I do have a shortcaller

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We're gonna test it out at the start stream

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
If I can handle it

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I will permit my reflings to zap me

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Every time I cause us to die

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I will try and keep the heart rate monitor too

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Just so you can see how freaking messed up I get

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Whenever we get near an enemy

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Now

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
I need you to open your eyeballs for me

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Because members asmr stream starts

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
One hour earlier

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Than my usual start time

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
The reason for that is

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Emi

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Azura

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Mercy

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Strawny

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Are doing a four man uno collab

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
So that I can't get away from mercy this week

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I'm already entangled in her snare

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And then

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
So that's two streams that day

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeah

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And then and then and then

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Sorry I did apologize for your head

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I didn't get a good sleep last night

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Again

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm getting very tired

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Actually I'll tell you something really bad

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So I had to take sleep medicine the other day

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But whenever I take sleep medicine

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
I have problems going number two

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Okay

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
And

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
And then I hurt my butt going number two

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
So

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
If there's any

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Anyone that wants to help kiss it better

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
And then Elden Ring part two

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
We again will have a full endurance on that

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I am literally weaving

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
So much content in between this as well

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Because I'm also starting up

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
My thank you series

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
My one ASMR video pair

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
1000 views thank you series

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I am absolutely

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Delighted and exhausted

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
To learn that I

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
My

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Scheduled

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Uploaded ASMR for 1000 subs

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I've already reached 7000

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Which means the debt of six is still to be paid

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I'm very thankful

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh man I'm tired

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
After this stream today

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm actually going to record

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Three

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Collab ASMR's from my side

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Because three girls have given me their side

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
So

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I need to edit that

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Unending ASMR's

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Back to back to back

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
There's so many replays now

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
I know my mum is very busy

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
If you didn't know

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
AC's meme ASMR has gone live

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It is sniffing ASMR

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
If you like that trigger

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Mercy's ASMR has

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I got a fucking cat here in my mouth

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
All the time

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
You really do get used to it

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
When you get cats honestly

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
You're just like oh that's just another part

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Mercy has released Yandere ASMR

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Please if you absolutely despise

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
The meme ASMR's I got them to create

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Well guess who fucking

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Created them for them

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
So if you hate them don't be like

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Mmm this video is stinky

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Be like mmm strongy stinky

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Because she came up with a concept

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
So don't if you didn't like it

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Don't worry it's not like it's the only ASMR video

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
They're ever going to produce for free on youtube

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Like fucking relax

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
For one

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm sorry I'm literally fighting imaginary people

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Not one person has said that

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
At all I know for a fact no one has said that

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
And I'm like already swinging

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
On behalf of the girls

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Like don't say nothing about my girls

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
But yes

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Mercy's ASMR actually

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I was influenced by well

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
So I had already created this

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Over a year ago

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And I think this was before the creator

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Of Yandere Sim got outed

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
For all of his

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm 32

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You have so much power over me tweets

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Or whatever the tweet was

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I can't remember the ins and outs

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
But

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
If you didn't know

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
In Yandere Sim there's a mechanic

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Where in order to lower your craziness levels

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
You need to laugh

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You need to laugh very loud

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And very startling

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And if anyone is around you while you laugh

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It alerts them

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And I was like how did I do that for Mercy

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So I did an intro

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
A little setting up the plot

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
She comes and finds you type thing

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And then she laughs like a maniac

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Ear to ear in the mic

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And I absolutely love it

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
But I think that's cause

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I knew about it. I've never actually played Yandere Sim

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
But yeah

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Preemptive defense is a good strategy

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Literally just smashing people's skulls in

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
No one has said a thing to me

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
But the rage has already taken over

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
The only discord group with speedrun pan records

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Honestly

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Also Emi and Momi's ASMR came out

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh did Emi release it

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
So

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I went the complete

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Meme route for Emi

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
But Emi isn't quite

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
With me on the same page

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Which is fine, it's completely fine

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
She has complete control

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
So I was like upload it if you want it

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh wait she did upload it

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Okay

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
So she kept the thumbnail the same

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Okay I thought she wasn't gonna like it

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Okay

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
So she's called the video

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Alleyway Tingle Dealer

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Sells you completely legal tingles ASMR

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
That's good title

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I like that title

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
My title was

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
VTuber Sells You

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Tingles in an alleyway

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I think or something like that

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
We did have to

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
The artist at the time drew

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Emi

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Sorry they're twins

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
drew Emi

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
So we had to put a little

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Sutton Sutton over

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I loved the 30 minute Japanese one

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm glad you enjoyed it

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
That is basically what unscripted

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
ASMR turns it into

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
If I don't have a script I will

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
YAP my head off

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
So Emi also has her meme ASMR

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Now that she's monetized which is

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Fan Tiddlyastic

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
The next

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Meme ASMR

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Which I'm actually gonna ask her permission

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
To do it once

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Once your monetization stream

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I know professional streamer by the way

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Once your monetization stream

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Has finished

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
My dear Shubu

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Would you like me to upload

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And pub

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Is it publish? No

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Upload and

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Put live your meme

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
ASMR

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
You guys are gonna freaking love the plot

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Shibu's plot was so unique

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I had to go away and record

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Folly sounds which is rare

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
For me because I have a massive bank

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Of sounds that I can

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Come from

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It was great

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
You were loving the ear mask

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Oh you like the 7 girl

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Collab

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh yeah you like 7

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Ovens being together

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
7

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Whole Neckos

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Well if you're excited for that

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
There's another

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Next week there's another 7 man collab

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm gonna have to edit it

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
The work never ends

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I don't know what you're saying

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Anonymous

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I love the ASMR you did with DTW

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And the rest oh thank you

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It was so hard to put together

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You know she's such a busy person

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I was so excited to see that

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Oh I'm glad you like it

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Thank you for the tip Anonymous

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Yes

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
7 man

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
No 7 person collab

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
With another girl

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
V.A

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Surprise surprise you've already guessed

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
What channel it's going on

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
There's no way in heck

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
You don't know who it is

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And then after that for next week

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
There's another 7 man collab

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I need to put together

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
The work never ends

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
But the work is good

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Wait I'm gonna need confirmation

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Right think of one V.A

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That I talk to all the time

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
And burst in in this chat all the time

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Thank

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Thank

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
That's who's next

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
And then the next one after that

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Actually did a watch along of us

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Because I have the artwork so I can edit it

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But then the fourth

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
7 man collab

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I'm waiting on this animator

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
To animate the artwork

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And the worst part is

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Well actually

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
It's not the worst part

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The animator that I usually use are like

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh I've just had a wedding

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And I'm like oh my god congrats

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Meanwhile

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
My stuff has been unedited

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And the deadline has slipped

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Almost 2 weeks now

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
And I'm like congrats on your wedding

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
But your honeymoon phase is over

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Please get off of her and let her have some rest

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Okay and do my work

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Thanks I paid you for this

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Can you just do it that'd be great

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Because I'm currently freaking waiting on

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh mama yunya what's up bro

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
No not mimosa

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
No I do have a collab with mimosa

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
But that's a one on one collab

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm jumping on her

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Remember of yumi plus as a 3dio

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I need to write the plot and send it to her

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
And another piece of work that I have to do

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
By the way

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And shibi has

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Finally got a new short

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Pro shibi only has two shorts

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
She finally has a third

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
And all of harem are welcome

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Who is that shleg yeah

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
That shleg right

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Harem

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Is

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
A harem is

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Very thankful towards strawnee

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Because strawnee gave shibi the script of praise

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
So the reason why you hear shibi praise you

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
In that short

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Is because of strawnee

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
So all of harem

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Please say thank you strawnee

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
You're welcome little harem

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I'm looking after you

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Not only did I get her to say a short

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Where you discussed her but also

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Hi lots oh my god is that the real sin

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Sin star

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I still need to message you about

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Rearranging that

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
A collab

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Because

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
My dad

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Is coming home

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
In July

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
So

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
My dad's coming home

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Our father-in-law

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Oh do you want to meet your dad-in-law

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm not getting him to come on stream

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Because he'll be like

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Hi Reeflings

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Hi full legal name and address

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So he's not coming on stream

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
But yes

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
My dad

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Is coming home

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
For two weeks

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Yes all of our dad collectively

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Is coming home

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I thought about a few stream ideas

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Like you know how some folk do

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Like oh my dad goes through

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Like

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Reefling applications

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Like I don't know if maybe that would be funny

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Or I don't know if people wouldn't like that

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I'm gonna make a video

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
With him about like

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Being a gamer and like

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
People can ask him questions and stuff

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Being like oh what is it like knowing that your daughter's

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
A full blown slag and then he was like

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Because

Let's still pretend

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Let's still pretend

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I wonder if my dad sounds like me

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Oh his accents even stronger than mine

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Um way stronger

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
His radish sons

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Do you want me to get him to say that

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I could do that usually

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Does your dad talk in scots too

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
We are so bad

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Oh yeah no my dad's like got a harsher accent than me

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Um so my mum

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
My mum told me

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Not to speak in slang

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
But my dad does

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Cause he

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Is a

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I mean he just speaks

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Slang but my mum doesn't

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
So I don't really do it cause

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Is your dad single

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
No

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Oh my god are you trying to be my mum

What's going on

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
That's fine by me

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Imagine Strani introducing a

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Refling to her dad as her boyfriend

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And he's sitting there all stern

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Threatening us not to hurt his precious

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Cuttlefish

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Wait let me read that thank you

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
No my dad's like super nice and approachable

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
You don't need to be scared of my dad

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Honestly

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Like he'd be like

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Oh are you looking after Strani

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And then you go

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
In your voice cause you're like scared of him

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
And then he'll go

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Is she happy

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And then you go I think so

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
In your wee voice cause you're trembling

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And then after that

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Oh good that's it

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
My dad

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Me and my dad are on the same page

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Where as long as my dad's happy

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I'm happy

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
As long as I'm happy my dad's happy

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It's super

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Super duper simple

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Like that

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
It's nice to do that

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Reflings are happy I'm happy

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
If I'm happy

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Yes like this

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I think she's happy

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
She cusses me out regularly with a smile

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
On her face oh that's terrible

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
What is the Scottish

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Shotgun and how's it different

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I don't know

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
There's haggis in your face instead of pellets

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Papastrone

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Looks like

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
No he doesn't have beard

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
No beard

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Although he doesn't have beard

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
But he has not stubble

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Although he does

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
One to actually

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I'll tell you this is really funny

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
One time my dad tried to grow a beard

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And I was mortified

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I was like oh no

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
It's my mom's single

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
No

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You're teasing me refling

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
How do you think your dad would respond

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
If

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Refling said

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Or calls me daddy too

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Would I call you daddy

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I wouldn't think I'd call you daddy

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Like in my accent

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Daddy's pretty jarring and cringe

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Like oh yeah I like that daddy

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Mmm yeah

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Do you want me to tell him

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Like oh dad by the way

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
The refling's call me mummy

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I don't think he's going to get it

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
If I explain it

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I don't think he's going to get it

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I think he's going to be like what

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh I don't think he's going to confirm

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
That would be amazing

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Oh yeah daddy

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Give me a spicy sausage

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Literally no it doesn't work

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Extreme

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I wish he was going mental again

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And I think I warmed her up too much

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Get supported, get supported, get supported

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Nero

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Imagine thinking that listening

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
That would be crazy

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
And mommy and daddy and I think

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Accent isn't hot that would drive

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
That would be crazy

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Well I get real close to you

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I'm looking you in your eye

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Is that what you should be saying

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Oh my god do you know those convention

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Signs

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Those VTuber conventions where they like hold a sign

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
And it's like five dollars to get stood on

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Bro

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
50 cent for me to smash my

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Arse on your face how about that

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
One cent for me

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
A whisper daddy

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
In your ear how about that

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Okay

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
We're going to do a thing at this VTuber convention

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Called undercutting the market

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You offer your goods

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
At an unbelievably discounted price

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Now I know undercutting

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Normally implies there's going to be

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
A raise later on

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
We ain't raising none of the prices

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
The prices you see are the prices you get

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Pills out 20 bucks

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Take all my change that's a steal

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Strongly really undercutting the market now

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I'm like 99% sure

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I saw a cosplayer meme

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And she genuinely had a sign

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
That said like five dollars

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
To be stepped on and she was like

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I made like four hundred dollars

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
In a day type thing

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
So I guess

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
For that much we are getting married

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
With 50 children

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Thank you for the

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Is that Poland

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I don't know what that is

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Pozka

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
So I guess for that much

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
We're getting married with 50 children

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Nah no children

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Did you see Azura's alternative artwork

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
She did break all

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
What Azura did what

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I didn't know she was down like that

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I didn't know she was

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Down like that

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
She drew that of her

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
She drew that

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Yes Azura is an artist if you didn't know

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Literally all the girls have some sort of

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Drawing

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
History

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Background

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
KFP Spidey again with the five gifted

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Congrats to those who caught it with your

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Face

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
In your face

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Oh my god we need to play Kung Fu Chaos again

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Tornado

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Your doodles are so cute

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Oh no

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I don't know how to draw

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Actually I could

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I should have shown it on the hand cam stream

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I tried to

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Learn to draw

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And I was consistent for like five days

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Before work just got far too much

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I couldn't keep up with work naturally

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And the only thing

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I was wanting to draw

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Was the girls

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
So I have like terrible pictures

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Of me drawing the girls like way back

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
A couple of months ago now

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Sadly life got in the way but

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I actually do genuinely think if I ever hit

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
The Jenga with the five gifted

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Memberships thank you

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
In your face

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Sorry I'm really

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
If you didn't know there's a character called

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Candy Roll in Kung Fu Chaos

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Her and sweet and sour

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Were my favourite characters

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And when my voice gets squeaky

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Internally, not externally

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
But internally because of the

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
You hear yourself differently

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
From out loud

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I sound like Candy Roll

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
When I get really high pitched

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And I

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Know all her voice lines

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Was it ekololalia

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
When you repeat what you've heard

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And she's like

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
It's my candy ass

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
And I just love her so much

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
She's just like 10 out of 10 characters

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Oh my god

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Gen 2 roller skates confirmed

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Sorry some sort of girl on roller skates

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I don't care

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Bimbo! Oh my god we don't have a bimbo

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Wait

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
What would the bimbo be

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Maybe like a bimbo that lowers your expectations

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And then does something

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Xenowarrier thank you for coming

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Remember

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Roller skates

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
A bimbo maid

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I would need something a bit more than a maid

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I feel like maid is very default

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I don't know maid a bimbo maid

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
That is quite nice though

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Bimbo maid is cute

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Because then she can spell stuff

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
On you all the time

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
And then before you know

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Bimbo

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Possum

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
A possum mod

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Remove this man's testicles

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Possum

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
As in the thing in them that goes

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Anonymous

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I'm so conflicted about

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Who is my favourite in VLR

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Please hypnotise me to stay loyal

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
To you mummy

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Keep that thought in mind

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Not for what you think

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Because next week

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
We may or may not be rating

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
A very unique audio roleplay

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Paul Lott

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
That involves me and

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
The girls

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Maybe that kind of script

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Perhaps sea queen

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Script

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Might solidify

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Who your choice is at VLR

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Jealous mother

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I assure you

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I wish to share all

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
All the goodness

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
All the spice

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I have clear ideas

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
A possum are kind of cute

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
A masochistic maid

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Is meta

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
But it never goes out of meta

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I was debating on when to get membership

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
And then I decided if it's not on the day

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Strongly offers 50

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Cent butt smashes

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
What day will it be?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Honestly do you think conventions would let us get away with that?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Like obviously I'll be wearing a mask

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
And I'll have a little wig

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
So my hair is the same

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
But I feel like no one can stop

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
You're like

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Oh what are you going to do

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
A reefling lies down on the floor

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
And I quickly butt bash him and then get back up again

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Is that kickable to get out of the corner

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I feel like that's such a baby thing

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Oops I tripped and landed on my reeflings face

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
No

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
It depends I guess

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Because it would be really weird messaging

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
The convention and being like

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Hey

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Am I allowed to fall on the

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Faces of reeflings

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Question mark

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Am I allowed... well if they allowed

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Stepping because then you can start to argue

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Like oh but you allow other

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
VTubers to step on them

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Did you know that is also vexally

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Besifying

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
When I trip and fall on a reeflings face

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
With my

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Arse

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
That's unacceptable

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
But if I step on them that's acceptable

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Oh my god

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Convention

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Talk about having double sided

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Is it because I'm Scottish

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Convention

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
You can't do that

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
You can't show that you

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Believe in the British Isles

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Sorry

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
You need Kingdom over

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Scotland

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Oh my god convention

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
You don't believe in the independence of

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Scotland

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Convention

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
You can't say that stuff out loud

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Albuphobia

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Sounds like asking for trouble

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Well good thing my name is

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Johnny because we're making it double

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
That's right me out

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Sorry I was kind of going on

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Team rockets

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Blasting off again

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Oh wait that's not what they sound like

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
That sounded like cream

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Please be careful not to fall

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
What

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
As

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Team rockets

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Blasting off again

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
It's kind of there

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Yeah

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Convention what do you mean

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
So there's a possibility

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
In a certain timeline

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Um

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I may or may not be able to

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Make it to our convention

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Um

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I would love to do that

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
But the only problem is

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
We have a bomb

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
And I'd actually need to hire

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
A bodyguard two bodyguards

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Or one bodyguard

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Bro I'm going to be so embarrassed

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Messaging security is like

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
A private security comment being like

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Hey I basically need

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Security persons to follow me

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Around a convention is that fine

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Like for bodyguard

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Well I feel like the reeflings

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Would bodyguard me pretty much

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
So like any shitters would like you know

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Get eaten up

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I thought this thumbnail said

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Backshot bro you've been on the

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Patreon a lot too much

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Okay that bodyguard on me

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Three four four is quite a lot

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Four is because you're Scottish

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Nearly

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Nearly even

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
United with the UK

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Five might be a good number

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Five little reeflings

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
And a paycheck's a paycheck

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Literally

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
The bodyguards

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Just watching me like sit on everyone's

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
face

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Being like what have I been hired for

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I thought it was a convention for like

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Weaves or something

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Like not understanding this like for Retubers

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
We probably

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Get weirder requests

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
plausible

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
True blood reeflings would be natural

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Bodyguards

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I think I would have to hire professional

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Security

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Yeah no that's not the plan

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
A sniper too steady

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I'm not trying to take anyone's heats off

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Okay and what is this

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
France when Star Wars got released

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Did you know

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
That in France when Star Wars got released

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Was the last public beheading

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Hmm

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
What if they are also reeflings

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
The bodyguards I don't think bodyguards

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
With a full time job have enough time

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
To listen to me Japanese

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
About anything and everything

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
That comes to my head

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
What yeah it's true

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
The year that Star Wars came out

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Which is

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Nineteen

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Seven

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
What year did first

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Star Wars come

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I don't know

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
1977

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Was the last year there was a public execution

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
In France and also just happens to be

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
The year that Star Wars first came out

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Leaving yeah

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I've been at hold

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I have a full time job

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I can hear you yapping and so why not

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
How though aren't you getting distracted at work

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Can I give you a bone bone at work

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
When we do the ASMR stream please

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
The thought I have that kind of power

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's too much power

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Unlimited power

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Speaking of Star Wars

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Unlimited power

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I was freaked me out that scene

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You have done that to me at work

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Yeah stop you're gonna give me an ego

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
It's like one of my favourite freaking concepts

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Oh my god should I write

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
A joystick

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
About doing it at work

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And being subtle

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
No I don't want you to get fired

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I don't want to encourage such behaviours

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I'd rather you didn't get fired

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
As much as you may despise

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Work as a whole

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
It's good for routine for the brain

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
It's good for socialisation

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
It's good for keeping you active

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
And the neurons firing

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Maybe capitalism won a little bit there

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
But maybe reduce it to a four day work week

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
A four day work week

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
And not putting it up to ten hours

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Because that's outrageous

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
And then for those

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Who choose to not

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Those who work on Friday, Saturday, Sunday

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Get a cheeky bit of overtime as well

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Because that's not common in all countries

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Anyway before the tinfoil hat goes back on

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
What it's been 44 minutes already

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Guys why didn't you tell me to start the game

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Are you squidding me right now

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
You and the rest of the girls

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Sheepy goes live in T-Main

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
And we're in five

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Showing her thighs and feet

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I have taken so long and been so

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Distracted

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Let's turn on this desktop audio

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
So you guys can hear what I hear

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
And let me turn off my

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Background theme

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
This is what I hear in buckshot

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Okay we're just going to jump into it

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Hopefully that's not too loud

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Testing

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Let's get my schedule off stream

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
We know what schedule is

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
We're very thankful

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
It's been 45 minutes, start the game

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Oh now you tell me

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I might have to

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Put brightness up

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
I noticed that in my Crash Bandicoot stream

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
The brightness was so not bright

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
But on my screens it was bright

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Hold on, hydration

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
V-B-N-Y

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
V-N-N-Four

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Hold the scape tag

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Oh

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Oh my god

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
We're Germans

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Germans like to rave

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Abandoned buildings for some reason

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Can I get a light mate?

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Are you got anything on you?

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Are you got a wee baggie on you?

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
No right, we'll just keep going then

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Please sign the waiver

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
What's my name?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Oh my god my name is

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Ah

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Ne

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
That's me

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
That's you

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Dealer

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Anon

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
One live round, two blanks

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I insert the shells

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
In an unknown order

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Oh my god this back

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Like the faded out background music

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Shotgun, shooting yourself with a blank

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Skips the dealer's turn

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
If there's two blanks

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I shoot myself

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Okay, okay, okay, statistically

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
We're now at 50-50

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
We're at 50-50

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I'd rather give it to him

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Shooting yourself

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
No, I want to shoot him, how do I do that?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I shoot the dealer, 50-50

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I'm sorry mate

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Oh no

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Oh no, he's gonna

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
A defibrillator

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Careful now

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Defit

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Alive

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Three rounds, two blanks

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Odds are what?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
They enter the chamber in a hidden sequence

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Free live

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I want to shoot, sorry

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Three live, two blank

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Okay, now it's 50-50

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Two live, two blank

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Mmm

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Okay, okay, that's good, that's good

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Cause now it's two live, one blank

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Okay

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I am shit at this game

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
You're lucky

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I left you with a charge

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Get up and on

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
The knight is young

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Do you want this?

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Okay

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Do I need to turn the brightness up on stream?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
So

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
The game

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Is it bright enough for you guys?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Sorry, I'm gonna read chat

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
No, it's good, it's good, okay, thank you

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I don't know why, but Crash Bandicoot was so dark

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Wait, is he the one that raised me then?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Oh

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Welcome back

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Hi

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I thought this game took like 20 minutes to

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
One live round, two blanks

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Okay, the odds are in my favor

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
For a blank, so I'm gonna

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Myself

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Oh, okay

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Okay, safe, safe, and then again

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
The 50, surely I wouldn't lose

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
The 50-50 the second time around

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
BLEET! BLEET!

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Are you serious?

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Are you serious?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
What the heck? I thought this was an easy game

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Careful now

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Oh goodness me

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Right, three live, two blank

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Used up all my luck on my daughters

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
That's what's happened

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Three live, shoot the dealer

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Okay, the game is feeling kind

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Because there's now two live

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
And one blank

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
The game is trying to let me win now

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
I'm just gonna keep shooting

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Okay, okay, we did it

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
We did it, we did it

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
See, I do not gamble

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I have absolutely no

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Interesting gamble

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
And on which you won, replaying

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
You did it!

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Let's go

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Let's make this a little more

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Interesting

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Sorry, I'm getting comfy on my chair

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I'm sitting on my toes

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Two items each

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
More items before every load

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
This is my kind of game

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Oh, sheebie!

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
You didn't tell me you were a part of this game

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Sheebie!

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
You do not, sheebie

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Four

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
One live, one blank

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Yeah

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
So what do you do?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Dealer

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Skips the next

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
turn

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Does that mean if I sheebie him up?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
So I can just

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Shoot both of them and win

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Yeah

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
And then I get to shoot again

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Okay, yeah, yeah

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I'm getting it, I'm getting it

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I'm getting it, so we win

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Take that

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Okay

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Okay, now what?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Oh, I get more items every round

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Okay, you should come front

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Be your

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Meh!

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
What was that? No, no, no, come back out

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
What was that? It said God

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
A magnifying glass

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
What was that? It said God

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Two

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Oh, it's a 50-50 again

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
What does beer do?

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Racks the shotgun

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Ejects current shell

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Racks the shotgun

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Check the current

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Round in the chamber

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Whoa!

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
It's a blank

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
So I'll shoot me

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Rack equals pump

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I'll pump you in a minute

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Don't worry

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I don't know if that means the same

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
But in Scots that means I'm gonna do you

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Okay

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Well, I did a blank

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
So two to one

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Okay, okay

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Oh, poor dealer

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
He's going down, but I don't wish

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
him any ill will

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
He just looks creepy, but I don't

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
He's taking a cigarette

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
You know, a cigarette

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
What? Cigarettes are bad for your health

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
To health?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Bro

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
He heals up

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
and does double damage to me

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
You wet fart

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Release me

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Oh, I've lost this

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I don't know what kind of

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I don't know what kind of

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
stuff be going on

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Sure, I'll take that and that

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Why not?

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Two blanks

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Three live

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I'll win in this one

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Oh

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
This is such a creative game though

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I'll give it though, I like this

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
It's live

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Well, you'll never guess who I'm shooting

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
That's so satisfying

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I like how it's not too loud either

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Do I need to lower in-game volume or it's all good to go

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Again

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Okay

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It's fine, all good

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Okay, okay

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Oh, can I do multiple items per round?

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Wow

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I got two blanks, the game's feeling nice to me

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Right, I think I can just shoot him

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
because there's only one left and it's live

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Yeah, take that

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
You wet fart

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Okay, we're back on an even

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
plain field

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Okay, what items

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
What items

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
What a curious game

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
God

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Okay, all I'm getting is handcuffs and beer

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
50-50, right

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Right, I'll handcuff him

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Um, please take these

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
handcuffs

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Oh, it's a harem

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Eject the current shell

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
It's 50-50, this will change the odds

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
out of 50-50

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Shit!

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
The odds are more likely it's a live round

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Oh, we're doing it

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
We're doing it, we have probability

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Okay

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Now it's likely to be blank

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
because the odds are now

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
one live to two blank

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
or three blank

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Oh, I don't like this part

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Okay, okay, it's fine

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
It's fine

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Right, and now

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
it's again back to being live

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Unless

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
put the gun down

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I can't change my mind

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Live

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
No!

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I'm not going to make every blanks

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Oh, he knows what's inside

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Very interesting

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Yeah, I'm not surprised

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I'm not surprised

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It's a 1v1

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Careful now

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Oh no

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I don't know what, I don't even

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I genuinely

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
do not know what's in this

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
There's no point in racking the shell

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Is there?

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Cuff him, everyone says cuff him

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Right, I'll listen to the replays because you guys are smart

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Right, I've cuffed him

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And then I'm gonna

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Okay

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Oh, I just ended the round

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Yes, I'll absolutely take that

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Oh, and the Sugi

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Giyazawi

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Whoa, the odds are

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
very high for a live round

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Sorry

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Look, I'm not this smart, it's right

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Regain a charge, I'll have a wee puff puff

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Puff puff puff

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Yes, nicotine

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
No, it's not good, don't ever

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
actually do it

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
A blank, right, okay

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Okay, okay, me

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Okay, that's good to go

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Okay, so now it's like 5 to 1

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
We're just gonna shoot

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
What a curious game

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I'm very intrigued by this

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I'm intrigued by the dev team

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I'm intrigued by the graph

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
You won, Refling!

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
And on one

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Long last, we arrive at the final showdown

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
No more defibrillators

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
No more blood transfusions

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Now me and you, we are dancing

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
on the edge of life and death

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Eh

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Eh

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Eh

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Four items each

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Handcuff

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Handcuff

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Magnifying glass, handcuff

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I'm starting to forget about the feet

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Eh, you know the drill

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Is he gonna handcuff me?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
If I handcuff him

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I can double

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I can double shoot

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
and the odds are he's gonna get shot

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Okay, there you go

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Okay, we're doing it, we're doing it

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Doesn't tell you what his health actually is

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
So he's

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
So we can just double

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Oh no, they're both blank, aren't they?

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Ah, yeah

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Wait, no

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Oh no

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I messed up, hold on

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Yeah, okay, right

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Fresh start and two new items

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
What we get, what we get

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Show me the money, we got beer

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
More handcuffs

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Oh, a beer

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
More handcuffs

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Four live, four blank

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
50-50

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Handcuff

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
That gives me two in a row

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Eject one to make

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
seven on the board

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Odds are live

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Blank

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Two blank remaining

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Four live, odds are

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Shoot, shoot, shoot

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Shoot, shoot, shoot

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
One

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Blank

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Four live

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Wow

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Can't give him that

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Can eject again

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Wait, no, wait

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
What did I just do, sorry, eject

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Live, three live, one blank

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Shoot

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Cuff him, oh could I have cuffed there?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
No, he's still cuffed

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Okay, now he's uncuffed

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
He's gonna eject

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Two live, one blank

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Oh, handcuff though

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Health revivals

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Eject to live

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Two live remaining

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Son of double for two health

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
No

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Three health total taken

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Out of two live

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
This game is good

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
This game is good

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Oh, I like this game

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Hold on

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Okay, we got health

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
We got a peak, we got two peaks

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
A health and a cuff

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Three live, two blank

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Okay

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We're gonna cuff

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
We're gonna heal

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
We're gonna heal

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Because we do need a cheeky bit health

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Because it is

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Three live, two blank

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Do we take a peak or do we

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Wait, no, just taking a peak

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Matter if he's cuffed

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Well, because yeah

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Doesn't matter

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
No, it doesn't

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
That's what

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Two blank

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Oh, dear

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Oh, dear

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Doesn't matter if he's cuffed

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Doesn't matter what the results are

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I've already forgotten what we're at

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Is it one live, two blank

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Or two live, one blank

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
He's got two heals on the board

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And he's got double son off

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Now it's two live, one blank

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Sugar didoo

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah, he's gonna shoot me

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
No, for two health

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
He's gonna shoot me for the son off

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Oh, this is

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
My odds

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Gosh

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Wow, hopefully

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I can get some cigarettes

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Right

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Cuff

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Wait, why cuff?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's two blank now

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It's two blank now

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Yeah, so why

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Shouldn't have cuffed

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Remaining ammo

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Zero, they're both blank

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
What

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I'm not right, I need to focus up

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I'm getting, I need a piece of paper or something

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Maybe there won't be one

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Right, items, cuffs

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Peak, peak

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And oh, we've got a double son off

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
If we peak, we could get a double

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
We could get a double

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Four to two

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Four

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
To two

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Cuff him

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Let me know what's going on under the hood

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Let me double up the damage under the hood

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Beautiful

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Let us acquire two HP damage

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Oh

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That's fine

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
So now we are three live

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Two blank

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Now it is a two in three

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Oh dear

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Oh, he just released the blank

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Oh no

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Oh no, this can't be

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
This can't be

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Oh dear

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I am on life support

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I believe there's

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Unless that's it, I don't know

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
There's two on

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Okay

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Well, I'm handcuffed

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
He's won

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I've lost the odds game

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Oh no

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Strummer bad, I'm handcuffed

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Are you ready?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Well, I can

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Hopefully there's a heal

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Double damage

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Double damage

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Double damage

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Aww, what are these?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Oh, live, live, live, live

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Five live, three

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Goodness

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Me, heals don't work anymore

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Oh, you can't even heal anymore

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Oh, that's why the game's giving me

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Triple damage, right? Let's see what I'm working with

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Blank

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
What was it?

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Five to three, so now it's five to two

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And then

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
We'll just check again

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Okay, live

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And then we'll do double damage

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Unfortunately, the odds

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Are not in our favor

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But hey ho, so that's four

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
To two

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
You're not gonna make it

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Unless he throws

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
We ain't gonna make it

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Oh wait, what?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Oh

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Oh, wait

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Are you saying there's a chance?

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
If it's in the chamber

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Are you saying there's a chance?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Against all odds?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
What'd I do with it?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Oh my gosh

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
From the brink

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
What a fantastic game

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Oh my goodness

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
What a fantastic game

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Press any button to exit

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Wow

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Double or nothing unlocked

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Wow

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Are these the developers?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
The symbol?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
By computer game by

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Mike Kaluub

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Nika

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Congrats!

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
What a fantastic game

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
The visuals, the direction

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Do we go again?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Do we go again?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Double or nothing? How did I do double or nothing?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Is it just start?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Just start

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Start then click the pill bowl

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Wow

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
It's changed

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Because of our progress

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I'll click the pill bowl

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Consume pills

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
May impair your ability to drive

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But reeflings, I don't want you to go

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Consume the double or nothing

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Oh no the guy's gone

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Bye strongy, no reefling no more

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Please sign the waiver

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Yes

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I am blown away by this game

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Sorry, wait I know how to spell your name

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Sorry, sorry

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Sorry I didn't mean to misspell it

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It was a genuine mistake

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Double damage

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Handcuff

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Mobile phone

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
What are you?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
One live to blank

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
A mysterious voice gives you insight

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
From the future

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Swap the polarity

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I think we'll just cuff and double shoot

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
If the both of the blanks happen to be in there

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Wow I have rubbish luck

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Okay that's fine

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Now it's a 50-50

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
If I shoot a blank at him I'm going to be

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Should I go all

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Oh I'll tell you

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Okay rough start

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Double or nothing, rough start

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Oh he's double starting

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Now it's a rough start

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Jeez I've got

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Two health already

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
He's got a health upload

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Smokes as well

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Hydration check

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Okay we can pump one out of the chamber

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
We can heal and we can swap

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Oh another polarity

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Wow okay interesting curious

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Again

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
With a blank

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I am going to pump one out of the chamber

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
To see what the odds are

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Okay now it's 50-50

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So I'm going to heal up

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Because we already know what's going to happen

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
And then we're going to

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Sol it off

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And we're going all in on

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Double damage against him

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Dealer

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Use the phone

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Right I'll use the phone

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
The phone about the current round or the next round

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Oh my god he's doing double damage

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Against me

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
That's so bad

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Right I'll do the phone, my apologies

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I thought the phone was like for the next round

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Careful now

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Careful refling

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Wouldn't want to be dancing

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Death row

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Let's see you

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
What is you

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Okay

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Let's ring ring

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Hello

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Three lie four blank

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
The game is trying its best to help me right now

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
A mysterious voice

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
How smart do you think

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I am reflings

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
To be able to retain

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Information that on the sixth

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Shell it's blank

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
How smart do you think I am

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
What is this a pipe bomb

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Steal an item

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And use it

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Well

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Oh no

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Oh that's exactly what happens

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
They put adrenaline directly into

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Your bloodstream

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
What was that medicine box

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I wonder what this is

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I don't have it yet

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
There's nothing I can do

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Are those in coffin and double shoot

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
That also means the fifth isn't going to be blank

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Are those going to be blank

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I just need to send it

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Sorry I can't

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
No okay

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
So it means these next few are alive

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Gotta go straight to coffin

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Meet

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Okay

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Okay I've definitely messed up this one

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
What is that

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
A medicine packet

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
He takes a pill

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Aw healed

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Okay that's fine cigarette or pills healed

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Oh no

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I've lost

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I've lost

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Oh no

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Who is he calling

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Literally I get

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Aw that's such a shame

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Wait

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
He put the polarising effect on

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Oh no I'm gone

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Sorry

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Sorry sorry

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I didn't know how the phone worked

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Not that it probably would have helped

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Oh by the way the sixth one's a blank

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Aw thanks for that mate

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Let me just add it into my fucking calculator

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Have the largest IQ

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
My brain goes three sides

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
You know the average person who can only retain

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Like freaking what

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Four bits of information at a time

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Like come on give me a chance game

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Let me write it down

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Give me a wee piece of paper and I'll write it down

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Just like this

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
He kicked the hell out this cuttlefish

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Literally I'm

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Calamari right now

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
By all accounts right let's try that again

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Pump one out the chamber

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Adrenaline burst health and

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Double damage okay

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Okay we can work with this

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Four report

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Two live three blank

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
What do I do with that

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Information

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I don't know

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
If three blank should I shoot

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Myself

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Or should I make

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The odds known if it's 50-50

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Three blank two

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
50-50 double damage

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Let's go

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
50-50 double damage

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Two blanks in a row

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Possibly

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Oh yes

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Okay

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Okay

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Okay

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
He's gonna pump it out

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Now it's back to 50-50

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I'm being cuffed but I do have a blank

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Yep and then one health

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Damage on me

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Unless he wants to use the polarizing effect

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And let me win

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But that's slightly different

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Okay that's good

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Let him get up

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Good shot

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Are you squinting me right now

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Cooper

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Brian Blasterman

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Thank you for the five Cooper

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And yes I will blast the man

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Okay two blank one live

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I have nothing

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
What's that medicine

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Steelers medicine

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I think I'm gonna steal his health

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Prevent him from healing up

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Give me that

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Give me that what does it do

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Why did my head just

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Two blank one live

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Two blank one live

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Medicine is 50% chance

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
One damage and two heal

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Oh wait is that

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
You got the good pill if it's a bad pill you'll lose health

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Oops

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Okay we are classic 50-50

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
If we get this we have won the first round

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Of double or nothing

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Dealer

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Oh that was a clean round

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
That was a clean

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Round of odds

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Very clean

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And on win

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Okay I'm not taking medicine again

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Cause I didn't realise I could hurt myself

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
With it

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Okay

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Oh great fucking tiddlywink spawn

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
No I'm not taking that

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Okay what are the rounds let me know

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
One two three four

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Full eight 50-50

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Full eight

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Remove one from the chamber let me know my odds

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Four four

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Three four

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Hmm

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Hmm hmm

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Three three

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Six total

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Fourth shell

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Live

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Ray

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Can I just take his fucking heal then

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Six

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Four is live

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Six total four is live

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Six total four is live

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
So I have to

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
It's most likely a blank

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
You know that

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
If four is live in that sequence

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
There are most likely two blanks

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Before it

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Wait

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Did I not take a heal

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Did I not take a cigarette

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I'm not being dumb

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Did I not

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Two is your max

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
You can't over heal

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Oh

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Fuck

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Fuck

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Fucking just show

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
This is not gonna work well

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
No

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
No

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Why is he didn't polarizing

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I suck at this game

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Get let me go again

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Let me go again we've got time for another

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Why is this game

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Ah okay soak it this shite

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
The only thing I'm good for sucking is willy

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Not this game

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Get me in that room

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Right you

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Again

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Please sign the waiver I consent

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Your gacha look is not great

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I've actually never played a gacha game

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Calling a friend

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Polarizing in the seat

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Right I'm glad we can get a peek

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Let's try this again

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It's okay

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
It's okay

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I'm gonna take a peek

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
What do we got

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Alive

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I am gonna steal

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
His son off and give him two damage

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Now I'm aware he has a heal there

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
No I'm not I'm gonna steal his heal

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Your cigarettes are mine

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Oh you can't over heal

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
The reeflings just told you

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
That mere moments ago

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
That you can't over heal in this game mode

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And what do you do

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Reade it over heal you could have had him down to two

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
You could have had him on the ropes

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
But no no

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Okay 50-50 odds

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
He's getting insider knowledge

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Did you know

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
The celebrities calling the paparazzi

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
To tell them ahead of time

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Where they're gonna

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Right

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Three lives

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Two

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Blank

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And he's gonna hurt me

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Real good

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Three lives two blank

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Three lives two blank

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Three lives two blank

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
We won blank three lives

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
That's right take that

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
You stinky stinker

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
No two lives one blank

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Yeah I'm not surprised

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I'm not surprised

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
That's okay that's okay let him get up

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Let him get up

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So now there is no blank

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Where

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
What

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
How can that not count

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Now it's even again

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
We're back

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
We're back

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Right now

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
There's no blank

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Yeah there's nothing now

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Not gonna take that

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Might use that

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Double or nothing

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Double or nothing

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Double that dammit

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Okay 50-50

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It's 50-50

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
What you can do is call in a pow

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
It's 50-50

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Let's give him the damage

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Let's go let's re-inhale

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
When I said re-inhale

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I didn't mean like

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Wind, literally all he

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Felt was low

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Oh man

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Alright so that's blank

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Very interesting

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
What are you stealing

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Give it back

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Oh you can have that please hurt yourself with it

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Oh

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I'm gonna make it

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I'm so bad at this game

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Careful now

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I'm trying to be careful

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
But I suck

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Okay if I eject this one

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
This one's blank so I'm gonna shoot myself

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I'm removing this one

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
The next one is blank

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
So I'm just gonna play it safe

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
And do that

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
He is using developer luck

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Remaining ammo oh my god you guys

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
You're trying to help me so much I'm so bad

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I'm so sorry

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Right we can now double spawn off at least

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Why did I get two turns in a room there

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Well it's now even Steven

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
No it's not

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
He has two health and not one

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
What is he doing

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Polarize him

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
What are you gonna do

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
No I'm so bad

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Oh my goodness

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
This is so hard

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Yes please

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Let me try again

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Let me get up let me get up let me

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Be very afraid

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
The fourth was the blank

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Yeah that's why I shot myself with it

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Wow sorry this must be painful

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I'm so sorry

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Look I'm not very smart

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
You guys didn't figure out I wasn't smart

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
By playing connect 4 with me

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Hang on

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You know what

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Yeah that's right

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Call me big willy

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Cause I got a big massive willy

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
One

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Right

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Let's try hard

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
It's time to try

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I only got two items

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Oh he only got two as well

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Big willy

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
It's a 50-50 the game

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Let's try again

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
If it's a 50-50 I could just win

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
By doing this

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
But he can do the save

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
To shoot me

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
But he can still hurt me

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Cause the first one wasn't

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Oh if you shoot yourself

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
You get to play a second turn

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
It's finally starting

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
To make a little bit of sense

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
But I can't over heal

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
So don't get jealous

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Whoa why so many items

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Oh he got loads of items too

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Two life three blank

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
No

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Three blank

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
No it's 50-50

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
No

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
It's

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Oh god

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I can't use my brain and talk at the same time

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Just let me see what it is

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Please

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Okay

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
So if I shoot myself

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I get to go again

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
And then I get to double shotgun

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Barrel

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
You

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Am I doing it?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Am I doing it? I think I'm doing it

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I think I'm doing it

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
No

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Why is my luck so poor

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
There's all life now

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
What does polarised do

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
You could have inverted

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And then sawn for the win

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Wait that works backwards as well

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
If I know it's blank

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I need to polarise it to change it

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
This must be the most painful place

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Or you've ever seen

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I even think we're going to be able to do it

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
In time for Shibi's monetisation stream

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Okay I didn't realise

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Polarising swapped

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Oh shit I did not pay attention

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
To how many live in

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
If I know it's a blank

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Use polarising

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Got it

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
If I know it's a blank use polarising

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Okay it's alive

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
It's alive

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
So

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I am going to

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Steal your double damage

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Steal his salt

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Yes I'm stealing his double damage

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
If I know it's a blank

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Polarise

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
If I know it's a blank

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Polarise

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
If I know it's a blank

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Polarise

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
You've already finished the game

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
This is infinite mode

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Wait it's the same

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Right he's on one health

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
He's going to sawn a friend

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Which is fine

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
He's going to cuff me

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Oh I'm zadding

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Oh yeah you want to

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
cuff me up

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Right he's healed

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Which is fine we're no one even Steven

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
What was that

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Adrenaline

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
He's healing again

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Oh you greedy

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Hello

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Why would you do that

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Question mark

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Did you mean to do that

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Okay please

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Take a xp

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
I hear a health down

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Oh yeah

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Oh no he's didn't polarise

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Oh no

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Oh no

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Ow

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Oh no

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I don't know what it is

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I don't know what's left

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Oh I do know what's left

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
So if I blank myself

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Oh polarise

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Polarise you stupid women

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Polarise

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Polarise

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Polarise to blank

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Oh my god I was so

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I freaking clicked it and my brain was like

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Wait a minute you were supposed to do something

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Freaking polarise

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Ah

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Okay give me give me give me

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Give me give me yeah give me yeah

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Give me yeah blank

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Right 50-50

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Okay 50-50

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Inspect element

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Inspect element blank

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Blank found

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Polarise effect

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Added

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Polarising

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
And then what shoot myself or shoot him

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
With polarise on

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Shoot him with polarise on

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Man she sure is pretty

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Yeah that's all I got going for me

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
This feature of model is adorable

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Okay shoot him

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
We did it I was so sorry

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Shoot um right we did it

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Willy wins fake Willy wins

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Imagine if this is the run I went on

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And it's the one I call myself Willy on

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Right

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Okay let's see what we're working with baby

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Rejection calling

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And focus right

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
For health on big Willy

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
50-50 odds okay

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
He can see he can cuff

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
And he can double damage

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Maybe the phone

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Can tell me if

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
What's first

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
If not I'll just use the magnifying glass

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
That's absolutely nothing

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Can you not pick like

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
The second bullet so I'll actually remember

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Right I don't have

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Polarising so I can shoot myself for free

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
That's

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
One

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
So odds are

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Shoot him

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
No

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Are you f**king

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Kidding me

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
High odds of

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Being live

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Literally the seventh shell is blank

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So and two bullets

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Have been utilised

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
This is the third bullet being utilised

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Right

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
So

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
So the odds of this one being

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Live are high

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Again

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Oh no

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Okay

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Is that four

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Shots now

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
So then

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Five and six are live

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Five is live

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
So

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Does this game want from me

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
What does this game want from me

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
My odds

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I know you can't rely on odds

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
That's just how odds work

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
My odds are

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Astronomically

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Right Willy's definitely

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
We can't do it as Willy

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
We have to go back to our roots

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
We have to go back to Anon okay

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Cause this clearly isn't working

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
It wants you to suffer

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
My poor Willy

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
My poor Willy got blown off

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Right

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I'm actually can

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Pay for it

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
These are good items

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
What are the odds

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Give me a 50-50

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Okay

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
We've got a 50-50

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I can't overheal past two which is fine

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
If it's

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
50

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
50

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Let me see

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
What's

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Or eject

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I might be able to

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Eject 50-50

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
and tell me what's up

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Right taking it out alive

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So if we're gonna get a blank we're gonna steal the polarizing

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
No it's live

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
We actually don't have a double

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Oh sugar but he has

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
the polarizing

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Well the next to her blank

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
So if he uses polarizing

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Then he's one

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I think

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
No he can only do one damage to me

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
This round

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Okay okay

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Steal the cuffs

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I don't think that would have

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Oh Andy's healing

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Bro

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Bro this is not looking good

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Why is this game so hard

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I just need you guys to like

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Send me your gaming fridge

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Cause this is getting so bad

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Careful now

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
All I've been told this game is careful now

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Careful now

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Careful now

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Yeah yeah yeah they're both blank

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
We know

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
We know they're blank

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Well at least I have a cigarette

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Right

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Two live three blank

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
But he doesn't have a polarizing

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
So blank actually means blank in this game

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I'm gonna steal his cigarette

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
No

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Can I get a vase

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Three blank two live

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Can I get a vase

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
So the three blank are up ahead

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
So odds are this is blank

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Can I steal his health

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I don't want him to heal

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Yeah this is blank

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
It's my guess

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Right this is blank sorry I'm guessing

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
But yeah okay odds are

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Yeah

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Right I'm happy with that

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Right we're gonna take a peek

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Blank again

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Wow

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
And then the rest are

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Live two live in a room

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Well unfortunately he's gonna get

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
A lick in on me

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
How do I suck so badly

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I'm not being funny

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I'm getting absolutely

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I'm getting

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Just

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
They're making a mockery out of me

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
They're making an absolute mockery out of me

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Does this guy even have a name

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Okay phone a friend

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Adrenaline

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Oh he got a heal I'm gonna steal his heal

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Right it's a 50-50

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Let me start comboing the items

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Oh I'm too dumb for that though

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
That actually feels like

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Injection into

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
That puts adrenaline into your heart

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Which basically forces it to go

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Like I'm just shooting

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
So anyway I start blasting

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Cause I'm unable to

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Keep up with them

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Oh wait I actually won out of

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Just pure frustration

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
We won that round anyway

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Starts blasting

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
We did it we made it to round two

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Of double or nothing

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I've still yet to make it

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
To round three

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Okay let's see what we get

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Cuff

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Double damage

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Not medicine

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Medicine that's not really medicine

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Too blind

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Does he have a polarizer he does

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Phone in a friend

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Wow

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Steel

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Polarizer

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Shoot him

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Steel Polarizer shoot him

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Yes

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Steel Polarizer

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Shoot him

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And then shoot

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Okay then he'll shoot

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Blank on me

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Cause we know it doesn't have

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Anything in it

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And then double sawing off

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Oh he's healing

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
So let him shoot

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
It's just fine cause it's blank

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Oh for god he can get an extra turn

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Efficient himself

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
I keep forgetting the mechanics

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Of this dumb game

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Why is it he is allowed to heal

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
And he's allowed to do this

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And he's allowed to do that

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Don't you know the video game rules

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Only I'm supposed to be able

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
To do all the things that help me

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Win the game

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Wow

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I never thought that far ahead

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I never thought in the first place

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
That should be my sentence

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I don't think

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Right what was that 50-50

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Right at least we can heal first

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Watch your enemies hand close

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Bro

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Hordeshell library

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
That gives me nothing thank you

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Let me again

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
What's in the chamber

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Blank

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I don't have a polarizer

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
So I can officially shoot myself

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Bunk

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Right and then

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
And then what

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I mean that means odds are

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
It's a double

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Cuff him

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Okay and then what

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And then

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
What I can do is just guess

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I'll say it from this one

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So what's this the third

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Wow

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
This is why I don't gamble

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I have no interest in gambling

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I have no interest in playing Genshin Impact

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Because it's a gamba game or something like that

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I actually don't know if Genshin Impact is a gamba game

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
But yeah

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Remaining ammo inside

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
You're trying to help me and it doesn't help

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Because I'm so dumb it doesn't help

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
I'm too dumb to be helped

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
You guys are just

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Gonna have to send in your gameplay and I'll commentate over

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And pretend that I'm playing

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
That seems like a plan

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Surely

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I'm not I'm losing it

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Right

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
New round

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Let's see what we're working with

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Two lives three blank

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
A burner

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Just show me if it's good or bad

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
It's good

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
I don't have a polarizer though

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Clink

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
And there's four in the chamber left

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
So let's talk to the phone

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Because they say, listen

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Okay

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
That means the odds have increased

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
That this is a live round

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So we're gonna say funk it

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
And

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
We start splasting

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Yes

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Okay we know next is blank

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
He doesn't

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
He doesn't have a polarizer either

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Oh

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Good or bad

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
We know this is blank

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
But we know that this is live

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And now he knows it's live

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
And he's got a double

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
It's ogre

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
It's ogre

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
He's cuffing me bro

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Wait what

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Now it's live

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Oh my goodness golly

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
This game if you are

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Like me in small brain

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
This game ain't for you

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I got one more in the tank

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Because she be getting ready to go live

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
We got one more

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Come on

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
That's it you know what

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I'm writing down

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
This freaking piece of paper

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
What the heck is going on in this game

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I'm gonna call in

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
This freaking

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I'm gonna call in the big guns

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Which is me writing on a piece of paper

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
To write down the odds

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
To write down what there is

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
To write down what to do

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
If we do not win this one

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
This settles it

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
That you guys are just far too smart for me

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And you have picked the most

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Are worded oh she

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
There possibly could be in all the lines

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Right pull out items

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Magnifying glass

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Health

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
No don't want meds

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I'm not taking my meds

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
You can't convince me

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Right what's in the chamber

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Two live

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Three

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Lang

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And then I'm gonna do it like hangman

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
On my piece of paper

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
So the odds

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Are already

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Not the best

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I am going to

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Seal

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
His phone

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I'm gonna steal his phone

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
No

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Yes

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Yes I'm going to

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
To steal his phone to get the intel

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Fifth shell blank

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Okay so for hangman there's now a B

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
On the fifth one

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
For blank

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
We are going to see what's inside

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Cause either way we're doing damage to this round

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It's a blank so we're going to

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Apply the polarizing effect

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
We're gonna put B on the first hangman

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Section as well

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
So we're polarizing

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
To make it hurt

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
The dealer is being shot

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
With the polarizing effect

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Resulting damage to the dealer

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Okay

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Okay

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
So first one's blank, last one's blank

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
We now know this, that's perfectly fine

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
We're lint

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
All it took was writing it down on a piece of paper

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
And playing hangman

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Neither am I, that's why we're playing hangman

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
He is now inspecting

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
He claims the contents

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Are very interesting

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
He shoots me with a live

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Round so the second position

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Is live

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
We are now on a 50-50

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
On the contents of the gun

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Being live or blank, we cannot ascertain

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
We can heal up

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
But we cannot ascertain

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
What is inside

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
This truly is a 50-50

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
He drank a beer

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
What did I miss it?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Two and three were live

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
The blank, wait

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
But none of us have a polarizer

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
So this round can't be complete

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
So we need to start a new

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Freaking round in hangman game

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Goodness gravy

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
All blanks

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Okay, okay, okay

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
A BBL

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
No I didn't get a BBL but thanks for asking baby

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Right

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Let's play hangman over again

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Let me, what is the ratio

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Three live, four blank

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Three live, four

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Blank

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
For a total of seven on hangman

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
One, two, three, four, five

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Seven

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I have adrenaline to call in

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
For information

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Which we're going to do

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Right, you can yoink the yoink

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Right, position

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Second shell, blank

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Hangman, second is B, blank

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Oh sugar, I just dropped my pencil

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
If we handcuff

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
And we are going to act like

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
The first one is live

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Okay

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
We are going to treat it as live

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
We do not know and we cannot ascertain

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
If that information is true or not

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
However, we can shoot ourselves for

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Okay, that was a blank

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
So first two are filled out B's

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
That leaves

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Two blank and three live on the board

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
We are going to shoot ourselves

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
To give ourselves another round

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Sadly

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
There are now five

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Pieces remaining

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
And we cannot ascertain

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
The knowledge, so we're going to treat it

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
As alive, this truly is a 50-50

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
We're going to treat it as alive

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Because odds are it's alive

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
You know what, I'm just going to go fuck myself then

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
You know what, because that's the thing with odds

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
That is the thing with odds

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
That is the thing

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
With odds

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Yeah

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
It could literally, you can flip a coin

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
10 times in a row and statistically

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Never get hits 10 times in a row

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
But that's the thing with odds

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
They are not reality

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
That's, right, another

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Sorry, I'm addicted

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I'm addicted, I like this approach

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Sorry, the hangman approach is quite fun

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I'm addicted, I can't stop

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
She beats up in 10 minutes

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
We've got 10 minutes to speak on this

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Come on

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
10 minutes

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Oh my god, come on, come on

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Please save the waiver

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I will, anything for you dealer

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Again, again, again, again

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Okay

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Who goes there?

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Identify yourself

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
3 life, 4 blank

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
3 life, 4 blank

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
7 hangman

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Okay

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
We have adrenaline

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
We are going to get intel

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
from this adrenaline

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
I assume you can only use adrenaline once per round

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Right, the intel is

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
The intel is third shell life route

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Okay

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Can we do double adrenaline?

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Hello

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Double adrenaline

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
That's cheating

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Blank, shit, we need, oh we have a polarizer

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Okay, that's perfect

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
If we handcuff

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Or does that leave

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
That's 2 life on the board

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
We don't know about 3 life on the board

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
We don't know about

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Tell you what we could do

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Handcuff

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Polarize

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Shoot

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Discard

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
The current unknown

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Because we don't know what it is

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
We don't know what it is

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
And I don't trust it

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
So we're just going to discard it

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Okay, we're just going to discard it

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
It doesn't really matter

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Okay, so we can write down blank in second

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
So now there's 2 blank and 2 life

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
The odds are straight back to 50-50 again

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
We are going to shoot

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Okay, okay

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
So now there's 1 blank remaining

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
And 2 live on the board

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Hmm

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I'm going to eject a blank

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
So all remaining are now live

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Shit

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
And he's going to do 3 health damage

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
In the sequence

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Wait

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Yeah, no, yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Then blank was the 5th there

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
And then it's 2 live remaining now

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Sorry, my apologies

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
2 live remaining

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Okay

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Unfortunately, he will get a lick in on us

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
But that's fine, that's fine

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Do you feel so big brain now?

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
No, I'm cheating by playing Hangman

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
And writing it down, that's how hard this game is

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
For me to conceptualize it in my head

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I cannot do this

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
In an abstract

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Concept

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I don't have the ability to do this

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I have to write everything down, it has to be physical

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
In front of me

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
We've got 2 insights

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Fantastic

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Oh

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I'm not going to do it for this round

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Umm

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
He's got a polarizer?

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
No he doesn't

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I might as well shoot then

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Shouldn't I?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
There's no point in using this stuff

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
It's a 50-50, I might as well just shoot

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
There's no point

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
I've got 2 phones

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
1 for the velar, no use the phone

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
No get info

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
What's the point in me using the phone

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Right now, because it's 50-50

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
If it's a blank

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Oh wait, yeah

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Idiot, if it's a blank then he can't get a licking on me

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Sorry

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Sorry

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Sorry, I'm a bit slow

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I'm a bit slow

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I'm so sorry

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I'm so slow

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
It takes me a moment to remember

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
The way this game plays

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
I'm so sorry

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Okay

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
We are on to the second round

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Yay

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Big brain time

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Can you feel the wrinkles

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
becoming more wrinkly in your brain?

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Your smooth piece of

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
chicken breast brain is now

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
magnifying

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
3 live, 3 blank

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
3 live, 3 blank

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Okay

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Insider knowledge, yes please

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Third shell, blank

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Okay

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Adrenaline

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Yonkers

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
I would like insider knowledge from the adrenaline

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
burst

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Okay

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
What are you going to tell me?

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Fourth shell, blank

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Okay

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Now

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
That leaves one blank

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Unknown

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
The odds

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
is now one in four of the current

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
shell in the chamber being a blank

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I think I want to shoot

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
So anyway

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
I start blasting

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
The odds of one in four

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Yep, okay

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
That's what I like to see

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Live one in four

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
We are going

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Okay, he's going to heal up

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
That's perfectly fine

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
He is going to be able to see what's inside

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
And he does have a polarizer

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
So I'm going to have to be cautious of that

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
He's going to check it out

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
What do you see?

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Very interesting

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Okay

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Oh he's shooting, it's alive

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Okay

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
So the next two we know are blank

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
So we can

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Blank it up to high heavens, okay

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Blank

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Bonk

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
And then blank again

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Thanks to our insider knowledge

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I can't believe it, hangman works

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
And blank again

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Then we are going to drink the beer

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
To inject the second last bullet

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Because we will be able to

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
If this is blank

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Or if it's live

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
So that was live

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
So that means the remaining one

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Is blank

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
So we can just shoot ourselves

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Bonk, okay

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
All good, all good in the hood

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
New round

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
We do

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Insider

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
The game knows we are playing hangman

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
The game knows

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
What we got, 4 live

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
4 blank

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
4 live

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
4 blank

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Hangman, 1, 2, 3

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Okay I don't have enough room on the paper

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Sorry I need to re-write that

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
That really awkward bit

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Right

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Give me the

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
What's the update

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Let us know what's going on here

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
3rd shell

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Live, perfect

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Let me know what else is going down

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Obliet

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I didn't realise he could do that

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
I didn't know he could do that

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Like thanks

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Right I'm going to

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Judgement, I'm still going to take this

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Because it's so much better and more valuable

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
To know what's coming up

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
5th shell, live, okay

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Okay, okay, okay

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
We only don't know where 2 are

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
That leads me to believe

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
So the odds are now

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
What

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
1 in 3

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
That this is blank

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
No, that's not

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
That's not correct

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I want to shoot myself

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Against my better judgement

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I'm going to claim this as a blank

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Because statistically it should be

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
We did it

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Okay we have a second round now

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
There are

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
3

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Blank

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
What does this mean

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Cigarettes

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
I can't heal up I don't think

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
In Minecraft

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
In Minecraft

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Unknown

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
2nd live

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I don't know

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Shit or not, your max is HP

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
4, oh is it sorry

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Let's have a wee quick siggy break

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
We'll start all over this

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Thank you, sorry, my apologies

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I thought this was like you couldn't heal it

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
A 4, 4, 4

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Should we get a cigarette, smoker and gen 2

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Apparently that's a really big

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Kink

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
That I didn't know about

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
You know a wham and smokes a siggy

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
No, I don't know what it's going to be

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
You know what

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
If I shoot myself

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
It's actually going to not be that bad

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Okay, we know this one is live

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
So we can shoot

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Oh no a double shot

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Shit

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
I get so excited to like

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Utilize

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
We would have gone on to the next round

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
We would have gone on to the next round

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
If I wasn't so freaking quick

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Shorty

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Okay, he just ejected a live

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
So it's live, live, live actually

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Wait what

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Oh

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Thanks for letting me go to the other round

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Even though I messed up

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I appreciate you dealer

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
The game must know I'm like sweating so hard

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
We finally made it

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
To round 3

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Okay

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Hangman ain't got nothing on us

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Okay

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Medicine

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Polarize

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
That's very

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
That's fine

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
2 blank

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
3 blank sorry

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Sorry number

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
We have no insider

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Information at all

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
We have odds which is blank

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
The odds stipulate

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
This is a blank so I shouldn't theory

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Put the polarizing on

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
And shoot myself

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
We have to go with odds

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
We have no choice

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
The dealer with polarizer on

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
So that was a blank

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
So now it's 2-2

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
50-50 perfect and he can see what's inside

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Very interesting

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Live

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Okay

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
The odds are now 1 live, 2 blank

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Wow

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
If I take the medicine I expire

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Because my odds are not good enough

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
This is it

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
I either win this game mode

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Or I lose it on whatever we pick

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Refling's

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Now the odds are this is blank

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Swallow the medicine

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I'll swallow it because you asked

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Me to refling

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Ah

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Refling

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Forever time because she be live

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
With celebration

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
It was worth it though

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I died doing what I love the most

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Guzzling refling's ink

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I perished doing what I love the most

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Okay

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
So I don't feel that bad

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
So good that was fantastic

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I can 100% see us

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Revisiting this game in a membership stream

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
I don't like replaying games

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I may have already done before

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
But thank you so so much

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Experience on this game

Another 10 out of 10 game

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Shout out to the developer

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
That is like such a fun little odds game

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
So goofy, incredibly entertaining

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
And the graphics

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
As well as the design

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Visual design

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Is absolutely beautiful

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Some people might not enjoy

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
The poly

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Looking art

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I can't remember what the art style

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Art style is the word I'm looking for

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
The art style

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Right, we are going to

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000

It started to click at the end

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
I need to redirect into Sheepsters

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000

At the regular time

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
And then 15 minutes later

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
I will swap all my equipment back

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
