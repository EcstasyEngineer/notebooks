7680	9680	Oh, there we go.
11200	13920	Oh, he's like, this world is free.
13920	17920	Oh, this is too early.
27920	29920	Three, he believes it.
29920	31920	Right.
31920	35920	Obviously, I've jumped into the game.
35920	37920	Oh, wait a minute.
37920	41920	Oh, wait, can I hear myself?
41920	43920	Oh, wait, can I hear myself?
43920	45920	Oh, wait, I can't hear myself.
45920	47920	Jeez.
47920	49920	Get the door.
49920	51920	Get the door.
51920	53920	Mama.
53920	55920	Mummy's here.
55920	57920	Uh, I'm going to open.
57920	59920	Um...
63920	67920	Hi, good morning. Good evening.
67920	69920	Good afternoon.
71920	75920	Uh, how is that all fit to scale?
75920	79920	Oh, wait, that doesn't fit to scale at all, Runelight.
79920	83920	Is that like that last stream?
83920	87920	It doesn't... wait, why is this on top of the freaking thing?
87920	91920	No, don't do that. That's even worse.
91920	93920	Go below.
93920	97920	Why is there two Runelights?
97920	101920	Do I have the game captures myself?
101920	103920	Okay, no, that looks correct.
103920	107920	I just need to do that.
107920	109920	Okay, Rinscape is just a funny-shaped game, okay?
109920	111920	It's going to be scoff.
111920	113920	It's just a funny-shaped game.
113920	115920	I'm too dumb for to figure out.
115920	117920	Is that a refling?
117920	121920	Refling, you already in?
121920	125920	Other player has accepted?
125920	127920	I'm like, damn, Reflings, you're quick.
127920	129920	We are in world high...
129920	131920	Oh, it's replays.
131920	133920	Hi, uh, red e-fling.
133920	135920	That's how I spell it.
135920	137920	Damn, Reflings are shown off.
137920	139920	I'm not even freaking said like,
139920	141920	oh, this is my update for today.
141920	145920	No way, they have freaking Gangnam style
145920	147920	and freaking Rinscape 07.
147920	149920	Old school.
149920	151920	I don't know why I said 07 though.
151920	153920	Oh, my Gangnam style.
153920	155920	Uh-oh.
155920	157920	Sexy refling.
157920	159920	Up, up, up, up, up, up.
159920	161920	Open them Gangnam style.
161920	163920	Howdy-ow.
163920	165920	Good morning, good evening,
165920	167920	and good after noon.
167920	169920	I hope you guys are ready
169920	173920	for a cheeky endurance stream.
173920	175920	Hi, Reflings. Hi, Strone, I guess.
175920	177920	Uh, yeah, I hope you're ready
177920	179920	for a cheeky endurance today.
179920	181920	Um, I...
181920	183920	had a bit of business
183920	185920	going on behind the scenes
185920	187920	business, business, business.
187920	189920	So, uh, I hope to have
189920	191920	quite a fun update soon.
191920	193920	I've just told the girls what the business was,
193920	195920	and, uh,
195920	197920	someone's very excited.
197920	199920	I just read their message,
199920	201920	but it made me giggle,
201920	203920	but I can't say or else spoilers.
203920	205920	Let me open up my inventory
205920	207920	so you guys can see what's up.
207920	209920	Yes, we are business, business, business.
209920	212920	We're doing, like, straight-up business, business, business.
212920	215920	Um, like, I'm...
215920	217920	The only thing I'm used to is
217920	219920	sponsorship people reaching out to me
219920	221920	and being like, hey, for a 60-second segment,
221920	223920	I will pay you this much.
223920	225920	This is what is going on.
225920	227920	Um, and then I'm just like...
227920	229920	Oh, yeah.
229920	231920	But this time,
231920	233920	um,
233920	235920	I got...
235920	237920	I will talk about it a bit more.
237920	239920	I'm gonna ask permission if I can talk about it,
239920	241920	because, um, the person is associated
241920	243920	with an agency that helped out to...
243920	245920	and if they're comfortable with it,
245920	247920	I'm happy to talk about, obviously, nothing.
247920	249920	Azur got monetized?
251920	253920	Are you telling me Azur got monetized?
255920	257920	I went to bed and Azur wasn't monetized.
257920	259920	Shibi was, which made me think
259920	261920	within 24 hours Azur is getting reviewed next.
261920	263920	I just hope her massive fucking
263920	265920	honkers don't, uh...
265920	267920	Uh...
267920	269920	I know
269920	271920	DEMPA isn't
271920	273920	in here right now.
273920	275920	DEMPA's just messaged me.
275920	277920	She's...
277920	279920	strong angry. You have a lot on your plate.
279920	281920	Do you think Ace of the Masters?
281920	283920	What do you need, DEMPA?
283920	285920	I won't charge.
285920	287920	DEMPA, I won't charge, darling.
287920	289920	Oh, DEMPA,
289920	291920	you're so adorable.
291920	293920	Never charge friends.
293920	295920	Always do it for free because
295920	297920	when you have friends like these,
297920	299920	life is good.
299920	301920	I have not even known DEMPA
301920	303920	for more than two weeks
303920	305920	and she's been nothing but a sweetheart to me.
305920	307920	Right, I am going to go to the bank
307920	309920	and clear out all my fishes in the background
309920	311920	whilst I ramble to you.
311920	313920	I have absolutely terrible news.
313920	315920	Just...
315920	317920	upshot news.
317920	319920	I tried to take a Joby,
319920	321920	but the Joby wouldn't have come.
321920	323920	So...
323920	325920	I'm probably going to have to take a big steamer
325920	327920	in the middle of the stream
327920	329920	which I'm raging
329920	331920	because I hate...
331920	333920	I'll always go for a shower
333920	335920	after I do a big
335920	337920	Joby
337920	339920	because I can't... wait, should I just make a...
339920	341920	I think it would actually be faster.
341920	343920	Hold on, Reflens. I think it's going to be faster
343920	345920	if I take wood out and
345920	347920	I...
349920	351920	Do I even have wood?
353920	355920	Do I even have an axe?
355920	357920	It must... I do have an axe.
357920	359920	Okay, then I need a
359920	361920	tinderbox.
361920	363920	Okay.
363920	365920	I don't actually have a bit of wood.
365920	367920	Right, that's fine though. We're going to go get it.
367920	369920	Right, we'll chop here
369920	371920	and then I'm going to make a fire outside the bank for now
371920	373920	just to eliminate
373920	375920	all of my inventory.
375920	377920	Oh, juice.
377920	379920	Oh, tiny cuttles
379920	381920	wants to trade with you.
381920	383920	What's your name?
383920	385920	Well, baby cuttles.
385920	387920	Um...
387920	389920	Hi. Oh, you already given me one.
389920	391920	Thank you.
391920	393920	Yes, I will be needing these. Thank you very much.
393920	395920	Little easy.
395920	397920	The best way to ruin friendship is get money
397920	399920	involved.
399920	401920	I went until I learned
401920	403920	about the development team drama.
403920	405920	Oh my god!
405920	407920	I've got a really funny fucking comment.
407920	409920	So, you know how I'm always telling you about
409920	411920	like, oh, we...
411920	413920	All I have on hand for wood right now
413920	415920	your wood is
415920	417920	more than enough.
417920	419920	Little roofling, I assure you.
419920	421920	A winky face, because we all know
421920	423920	what we're talking about.
423920	425920	Um...
425920	427920	I'm a mor... Oh, damn, bullshit!
427920	429920	I was talking about you!
429920	431920	Um...
431920	433920	I'm so scared.
433920	435920	I never streamed on YouTube.
435920	437920	Oh, you don't actually have to mod anything.
437920	439920	It's like customary to make you
439920	441920	mod
441920	443920	so that
443920	445920	you stand out more in chat.
445920	447920	DEMPA, I'm so sorry.
447920	449920	I was just exposing you. I just said
449920	451920	that you wanted an ASMR script
451920	453920	and I'm offering it for free, because I would never charge you for that.
453920	455920	You're...
455920	457920	Oh, freaking sick. I'm just not...
457920	459920	Wait, let me pick up... I'm doing two things.
459920	461920	Right, let me finish up the...
461920	463920	Why did that only take out one?
463920	465920	Oh, it's not looking good.
465920	467920	Now you all know that I'm a RuneScape noob.
469920	471920	Oh, yeah, YouTube custom.
471920	473920	Yes, you're learning, right?
473920	475920	Use Tinder Box on the logs.
475920	477920	Oh my god, you got a little cabbage head going on.
479920	481920	Okay, right.
481920	483920	Oh, I don't want to brag, but I'm level 2
483920	485920	if I'm making... Right, we are going to just get rid of...
485920	487920	Not rid of, but...
489920	491920	But yeah, you don't...
491920	493920	Yeah, so, as I was saying,
493920	495920	we got a little hate comment today on YouTube.
497920	499920	But do you want to know why it's so funny?
499920	501920	It's because
501920	503920	most of the comments were like,
503920	505920	vealers aren't going to last a month.
505920	507920	And then it went to two months
507920	509920	and it went to six months.
509920	511920	Do you want to know what today's hate comment
511920	513920	and quotation marks was that I had to delete
513920	515920	vealers aren't going to last
515920	517920	two years.
517920	519920	Motherfucker, if vealers last
519920	521920	two years, all three generations
521920	523920	are successfully out.
523920	525920	I don't... What?
525920	527920	Are you dumb?
527920	529920	I like how it went from not even going to last
529920	531920	a week, not even going to last a month.
531920	533920	Two years? Two years, all three genes are out.
533920	535920	Two years and I have succeeded
535920	537920	in what I wanted to do.
537920	539920	Duh.
539920	541920	I literally just like multiplied the time
541920	543920	dramatically.
543920	545920	And literally, it's a supportive message.
545920	547920	I'm like, nice try, but
547920	549920	bruv, wait, sorry. I think a re-film is trying
549920	551920	to trade me. Sorry.
551920	553920	Sorry.
553920	555920	I'm sorry, bruv, yet it didn't mean to not trade you.
555920	557920	What?
557920	559920	10,000
559920	561920	swordfish? Isn't that not like
561920	563920	99 right there? Am I going crazy?
563920	565920	Are you sure?
565920	567920	Oh my god.
567920	569920	Oh my god.
569920	571920	Wait, wait, wait.
571920	573920	Another reflin?
573920	575920	Uh...
575920	577920	Oh no.
577920	579920	Oh my god, reflin.
579920	581920	Alright, I'm getting drunk.
581920	583920	I'm getting drunk as a skunk.
583920	585920	Actually, I think we're doing
585920	587920	drunk stream near the end.
587920	589920	Helps make the job a...
589920	591920	I literally
591920	593920	got like freaking 10 kabillion.
593920	595920	Right, thank you. Let's go for a job.
595920	597920	Let me drink that. Let me eat.
597920	599920	Oh, I love the little bubble
599920	601920	sound effect. If I ever make a song,
601920	603920	like an actual song, like custom made song,
603920	605920	oh my god, 10,000 swordfish.
609920	611920	Oh my gosh.
611920	613920	Right, in order
615920	617920	to make this super simple,
617920	619920	I'm so sorry for anyone
619920	621920	who like is really good at organizing their
621920	623920	shit.
623920	625920	I'm not. I'm literally just going to shove
625920	627920	all the fish items to the top.
627920	629920	Please don't judge me.
629920	631920	Please don't judge me.
631920	633920	Right, I'm pretty sure that's all the shit.
633920	635920	Raw trout, you as well.
635920	637920	Raw herring, you as well.
637920	639920	And that's cooked salmon.
639920	641920	God, what a bank.
641920	643920	Gee willikers, I sure hope no one cracks
643920	645920	into a skullfish.
645920	647920	If you move to members later, it'll get
647920	649920	faster. One morban, literally.
649920	651920	Right, shrimp. We're going to
651920	653920	call the shrimp right now. Unless the fire
653920	655920	is out, I think the fire is out.
655920	657920	Wait, no, someone's lighting the beacon.
657920	659920	Gondor calls for aid.
659920	661920	We're just going to clean up our inventory.
661920	663920	I say that as if we didn't just get 10,000
663920	665920	freaking fish. Thank you very much.
665920	667920	Does me, I'm glad I could help.
667920	669920	Thank you. Bank tabs and shambles.
669920	671920	I'm so sorry. I know people are
671920	673920	really good at organizing their tabs.
673920	675920	I just couldn't, I'm just like, in and out.
675920	677920	Let's go. She's a hoarder.
677920	679920	But she's our hoarder.
679920	681920	Visucky
681920	683920	is done for. They can't compete with
683920	685920	velour, literally.
685920	687920	I bet you velour won't last until
687920	689920	velour stuff exists in.
689920	691920	Isn't it interesting?
691920	693920	Look at me right now.
693920	695920	Valia might only last
695920	697920	two years, but that's still a year.
697920	699920	22 months, 30
699920	701920	days, 23 hours,
701920	703920	59 minutes and 59
703920	705920	seconds longer than he probably lasts
705920	707920	when he touches a woman.
707920	709920	Bro, literally, oh wait,
709920	711920	whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, did you just
711920	713920	did you just roast him?
713920	715920	Thank you for the tip, Toria.
715920	717920	I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, until
717920	719920	I heard the very last sentence.
719920	721920	I was like, a Brian?
721920	723920	Brian?
723920	725920	Oh my gosh.
725920	727920	That was,
727920	729920	I didn't expect that at all.
729920	731920	Right, I can put this away because there's a kind of rifle
731920	733920	in making fires. Right.
733920	735920	We'll do anchovies.
735920	737920	We'll do
737920	739920	the...
739920	741920	No, don't eat. Oh wait, they're cooked.
741920	743920	Okay.
743920	745920	My apologies, such a fake gamer for
745920	747920	I cannot, oh my god,
747920	749920	really starting a freaking fire outside the bank.
749920	751920	Wait a minute.
751920	753920	I'm not the Rockwell uprising.
753920	755920	Like, I was naughty.
755920	757920	I'm not there all the time.
757920	759920	I'll be honest, I'll put my hand up
759920	761920	and I'll say I'm not there all the time.
761920	763920	I had a little peek yesterday
763920	765920	about what you've all been
765920	767920	anonymously chatting about
767920	769920	and someone said,
769920	771920	yes, Trony, I understand
771920	773920	Blackwell
773920	775920	headquarters.
775920	777920	And I was like,
777920	779920	that's so fucking funny.
779920	781920	So yeah, your comment got me excited.
781920	783920	I was seeing someone,
783920	785920	someone's like, a ritual
785920	787920	posting about Shibi and it's like, I am nothing but trash.
787920	789920	I'm just Shibi's foot and I'm like, yes, yes, yes.
789920	791920	Then the OG
791920	793920	Sons, those Czech and the OG Sons
793920	795920	they were spoiling I see.
795920	797920	Absolutely spoiling it.
797920	799920	He's throwing it off topic question.
799920	801920	What's your tip for Germany,
801920	803920	Scotland today?
803920	805920	Is there a football match on?
805920	807920	Use logs on fire to make bonfire.
807920	809920	We'll not go out.
809920	811920	Isn't that all RuneScape 3?
811920	813920	I don't think that's a thing here.
813920	815920	What about having many fires?
815920	817920	Hmm.
817920	819920	Any thoughts on doing
819920	821920	Iron Man so chat can't just give you everything?
821920	823920	VBop
823920	825920	You have far too much faith in me.
825920	827920	I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.
827920	829920	I know I'm not supposed to
829920	831920	name chatters
831920	833920	but my guy
833920	835920	you have far too much faith in me to think that I could do
835920	837920	the only way I could do this on my own
837920	839920	is by picking up
839920	841920	dropped fish and barbarian village.
841920	843920	That is the only way I know how to do it
843920	845920	because I don't have the funds.
845920	847920	I don't know how to make money in this game
847920	849920	and we'd be at this for hours.
853920	855920	Since strong debut,
855920	857920	something about her reminded me of a Pokemon.
857920	859920	It has been on the tip of my tongue
859920	861920	for an entire week
861920	863920	and I finally figured it looks like a
863920	865920	Cray Dilly if it was an anime girl.
865920	867920	A Cray Dilly?
867920	869920	Hold on, you're actually getting me to look up something.
869920	871920	Cray Dilly Pokemon.
871920	873920	Cray Dilly Pokemon.
875920	877920	Oh,
877920	879920	I know them.
879920	881920	They're in Ruby.
881920	883920	Kill things to make money.
883920	885920	Bro, goblins don't drop money.
885920	887920	The most expensive item
887920	889920	goblins drop is goblin mail
889920	891920	which is 500 a piece purely because it's a quest item.
891920	893920	Thank you Thierry for the other tip as well.
893920	895920	Honestly, I could see that.
895920	897920	Yeah, the fossil type.
897920	899920	Goblins are the best.
899920	901920	You're trolling me.
901920	903920	I'm getting trolled.
903920	905920	There's no way you guys actually think that.
907920	909920	I got my first bond via marbles on stream.
911920	913920	I wish you could do marbles on stream
913920	915920	on
915920	917920	thingy.
917920	919920	On YouTube.
919920	921920	But things are very slowly getting
921920	923920	integrated to YouTube.
923920	925920	But I
925920	927920	definitely feel YouTube
927920	929920	is becoming stronger and stronger
929920	931920	for streamers.
931920	933920	And like,
933920	935920	I think what we're saying
935920	937920	is that discoverability, who
937920	939920	dare add it.
939920	941920	DEMPA!
941920	943920	I don't know if you're still lurking.
943920	945920	DEMPA goes, I didn't think that far ahead.
945920	947920	What do you think would be cute?
947920	949920	I think she likes the kind of creature it is.
949920	951920	I'll write some creepy stuff for you.
951920	953920	You were strong and we were rooting for Scotland
953920	955920	today in the years. Oh, we're gonna do shit.
955920	957920	It's fine, it's fine.
957920	959920	The life of a Scottish
959920	961920	national...
961920	963920	Wait, no, hold on.
963920	965920	Nationality of a Scottish person.
965920	967920	Because we understand we're just terrible.
967920	969920	Although we're decent at rugby.
969920	971920	I'll be honest, we're actually no rough at rugby.
971920	973920	But the fit ball.
973920	975920	The fit ball, if you didn't know
975920	977920	football in Scotland,
977920	979920	you say fit, like F-I-T.
979920	981920	But no pronunciation on the T.
981920	983920	And then ball, fit ball.
983920	985920	Okay.
985920	987920	I feel like
987920	989920	YouTube could make discoverability so much better.
989920	991920	See, I think it does
991920	993920	enough. It's Twitch that has poor
993920	995920	discoverability. However,
995920	997920	people disagree with me when I say that.
997920	999920	And I'm like, oh, okay.
999920	1001920	I actually thought
1001920	1003920	Shawnee literally never leaves
1003920	1005920	her arms until she makes
1005920	1007920	her display.
1007920	1009920	Born blue, thank you
1009920	1011920	for becoming a member.
1011920	1013920	Enjoy the emotes back.
1013920	1015920	The girls emotes have been ordered.
1015920	1017920	I do have a bit of bad news
1017920	1019920	about it though. The person
1019920	1021920	that I get them done by, they're like
1021920	1023920	it'll take me a month. And I'm like
1023920	1025920	excuse me?
1025920	1027920	A month? And they're like, yeah, a month.
1027920	1029920	Is that okay? And I'm like, hehe
1029920	1031920	I guess.
1031920	1033920	And then they're like, oh
1033920	1035920	but we've also put the base price up.
1035920	1037920	And I'm like, oh, okay then.
1037920	1039920	Okay, that's fine then.
1039920	1041920	And I'm like, okay.
1041920	1043920	That's just kind of the worst of all worlds.
1043920	1045920	But yeah.
1045920	1047920	Everyone else
1047920	1049920	is going to get emotes before me.
1049920	1051920	I'm submitting everyone else's emotes before me because
1051920	1053920	I don't think it's fair.
1053920	1055920	My reeflings, you know how
1055920	1057920	unbelievably
1057920	1059920	well behaved you are for me and how patient.
1059920	1061920	And it's nicer for the girls
1061920	1063920	to have something to celebrate.
1063920	1065920	Because you already know I'm going to be here
1065920	1067920	every day.
1067920	1069920	And
1069920	1071920	Oh, I was saying that my first drunk stream
1071920	1073920	I'm not sure how much people
1073920	1075920	are going to like this. And I can already see
1075920	1077920	some of you typing and rolling your
1077920	1079920	eyes. Keep your eyes to the
1079920	1081920	front of your head. I don't want one
1081920	1083920	eye rolling to the back of the skull.
1083920	1085920	Um
1085920	1087920	What am I saying?
1087920	1089920	Um
1089920	1091920	My first drunk
1091920	1093920	stream was going to be
1093920	1095920	uh
1095920	1097920	drunk apex but I don't go off
1097920	1099920	line until we win.
1099920	1101920	But okay.
1101920	1103920	How did you time that?
1103920	1105920	There's a stream delay. How did you even
1105920	1107920	time that?
1107920	1109920	Fucking reefling in game said
1109920	1111920	eye roll. How did you time that?
1111920	1113920	30
1113920	1115920	ever stream. I well thought that
1115920	1117920	but then I was like would you guys rather
1117920	1119920	jellybean game? Some sort of drunk
1119920	1121920	multiplayer game.
1121920	1123920	So the stream is just never going to end pretty much.
1123920	1125920	Apex. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1125920	1127920	Everyone's like dunking on apex.
1127920	1129920	Well, there's other multiplayer games
1129920	1131920	we can play if you'd rather drunk
1131920	1133920	that. But I feel like drunk jellybean
1133920	1135920	is just going to be me like
1135920	1137920	please, please,
1137920	1139920	please let me, let me
1139920	1141920	get to the past and first level
1141920	1143920	please
1143920	1145920	I don't want to spectate.
1145920	1147920	Like and I'll be drunk and all that.
1147920	1149920	Why is so much fire? You had drunk
1149920	1151920	runes. How is drunk runescape fun?
1151920	1153920	I
1153920	1155920	put the shrimp on the
1155920	1157920	fire
1157920	1159920	it cooks the shrimp
1159920	1161920	and my level
1161920	1163920	gets higher
1163920	1165920	drunk fire cave
1165920	1167920	Oh
1167920	1169920	got drunk. I accidentally achieved 99
1169920	1171920	fletching
1171920	1173920	runescape is never fun.
1173920	1175920	You drink every time you make an alcoholic
1175920	1177920	drink.
1177920	1179920	We won't let you get past level one
1179920	1181920	this time around.
1181920	1183920	That's what I'm worried about
1183920	1185920	the true endurance stream for real
1185920	1187920	for real. We'll bank the bank
1187920	1189920	runescape is a job
1189920	1191920	Honestly, that's funny.
1191920	1193920	Oh wait, no, that's kitchener
1193920	1195920	but you're
1195920	1197920	un-cook-trure herring.
1197920	1199920	Castle wars is
1199920	1201920	for you play. Right, hydration. I need
1201920	1203920	to finish my tea.
1209920	1211920	which
1211920	1213920	yes
1213920	1215920	I
1215920	1217920	I've also planned
1217920	1219920	out the membership
1219920	1221920	streams for next week. Again
1221920	1223920	if you are unable to member, please don't
1223920	1225920	worry
1225920	1227920	dear little reeflings, I stream
1227920	1229920	every single day free access
1231920	1233920	What movie did I pick?
1233920	1235920	I think I might have picked
1235920	1237920	Austin Powers
1237920	1239920	for the movie
1239920	1241920	question mark. How are you keeping this
1241920	1243920	up?
1243920	1245920	I don't know. I thought you could only have one
1247920	1249920	or she'll start leaking secret.
1249920	1251920	No, I shut off about all the insider stuff
1251920	1253920	now. I'm starting to
1253920	1255920	leak it. Well, I've not said anything
1255920	1257920	that I regret saying. I don't
1257920	1259920	regret being like, yeah
1259920	1261920	we don't need talent managers
1261920	1263920	because it turns out if you give
1263920	1265920	actually I will like to expand
1265920	1267920	upon that point. Now that you've got me
1267920	1269920	on that subject, hold on a minute little reefling
1269920	1271920	the reason
1271920	1273920	why talent managers aren't necessarily
1273920	1275920	needed is because these girls
1275920	1277920	have streamed and they have plenty of
1277920	1279920	experience. Who goes there
1279920	1281920	and
1281920	1283920	to
1283920	1285920	go from
1285920	1287920	independent where you pick your streams
1287920	1289920	and you pick everything and then
1289920	1291920	you're on a one week basis where you need
1291920	1293920	approval every week to stream what you want
1293920	1295920	it just doesn't make sense or it doesn't make
1295920	1297920	sense to me. Okay, so
1297920	1299920	yeah
1299920	1301920	sad I'm going to miss the first membership stream
1301920	1303920	I mean you can always go back and watch the vods
1303920	1305920	at any point you become
1305920	1307920	a member you can access the
1307920	1309920	vods on the membership
1309920	1311920	strums. I just need to
1311920	1313920	once I make
1313920	1315920	the lobbies for them
1315920	1317920	I just need to make sure I do it for the correct
1317920	1319920	membership here
1319920	1321920	and holy crap we're creeping on the next level
1321920	1323920	I actually don't know what level we are
1323920	1325920	we're level 52 we're about to be
1325920	1327920	53 we're like slowly creeping up
1329920	1331920	wait are they flirting what's going on here
1331920	1333920	agility, construction
1333920	1335920	and slayer
1335920	1337920	oh we're all debating on what I thought
1337920	1339920	runecrafting was unanimously voted the worst
1339920	1341920	it's been stressful
1341920	1343920	with a manager I just
1343920	1345920	feel very strongly that
1345920	1347920	I mean
1347920	1349920	obviously in my instance
1349920	1351920	the girls in that are happy for me to say
1351920	1353920	all of them streamed way longer than me
1353920	1355920	why would they need to come
1355920	1357920	to me for permission to stream
1357920	1359920	it just seems rather odd
1359920	1361920	you know
1361920	1363920	just doesn't make any sense
1365920	1367920	runecrafting has a minigame now
1367920	1369920	all to make it faster
1371920	1373920	I'm thinking of
1373920	1375920	how many watch hours I need to stack up
1375920	1377920	when I get home though honestly though
1377920	1379920	I've
1379920	1381920	planned out
1381920	1383920	the
1383920	1385920	Elden Ring streams
1387920	1389920	but
1389920	1391920	I just realised I might have to delay it by a day
1391920	1393920	because of time zones I don't know
1393920	1395920	if the DLC has a time zone release
1395920	1397920	but from being
1397920	1399920	an upside down land
1399920	1401920	whenever there's an ad for a game
1401920	1403920	and it's like this game comes out on this day
1403920	1405920	I'm like well that's a lie
1405920	1407920	it's not like time synced
1409920	1411920	because I'm in the future
1411920	1413920	right now I'm in the future it's 4am on the 15th
1413920	1415920	like I'm in the future you know
1417920	1419920	so I might have accidentally planned
1419920	1421920	my Elden Ring stream a day too early
1421920	1423920	before the DLC comes out
1423920	1425920	but then again
1425920	1427920	we could play it
1427920	1429920	early
1429920	1431920	actually no it's not going to be a problem
1431920	1433920	because we're not even going to be able to be at the DLC
1433920	1435920	because we're starting fresh
1435920	1437920	how's the future
1437920	1439920	I mean
1439920	1441920	it's alright
1441920	1443920	I ain't got much of a quarrel with it
1445920	1447920	that's a lot of marks of grace
1447920	1449920	yes
1449920	1451920	that's going to be a major endurance stream
1451920	1453920	back to back
1453920	1455920	I've planned 4 days
1455920	1457920	around it
1457920	1459920	it might leak into a 5th day
1459920	1461920	so sorry to anyone watching that
1461920	1463920	the Elden Ring isn't your thing
1463920	1465920	you know
1465920	1467920	arise you tarnish
1469920	1471920	do you have a save file already
1471920	1473920	no I was going to start fresh
1473920	1475920	I was going to start from the beginning
1475920	1477920	yeah because I like when you guys
1477920	1479920	get to hold my hand
1479920	1481920	so the stream
1481920	1483920	and someone sent a marshmallow
1483920	1485920	and I was like can we invade
1485920	1487920	and I'm like that's actually what we do
1487920	1489920	so 2 reeflings come in
1489920	1491920	as an invader or enemy
1491920	1493920	and it means we can safely walk around
1493920	1495920	the areas and stuff
1495920	1497920	I didn't know if I should bring out the shock collar
1497920	1499920	so every time I perish
1499920	1501920	you guys get to shock me
1501920	1503920	I don't know if that's a bit too weird though
1503920	1505920	for what we're...
1505920	1507920	I feel like it's more going to be like nostalgia run
1507920	1509920	of like all of us being like I remember this
1509920	1511920	I remember that I remember when we did this
1511920	1513920	remember when we did that
1513920	1515920	and then I've just got a shock collar going
1515920	1517920	me every time
1517920	1519920	every time I mess up
1519920	1521920	ummm
1521920	1523920	we know what I hurt you
1523920	1525920	I will probably be on here runescape
1525920	1527920	and during that oh I need to finish my teeth
1527920	1529920	they're cold
1533920	1535920	I've been making my
1535920	1537920	teeth with far too much honey
1537920	1539920	it's rubbish
1539920	1541920	alcohol poisoning no I cannot
1541920	1543920	I cannot drink and play runescape
1543920	1545920	Elden rings there's no chance of that
1545920	1547920	the shock collar is
1547920	1549920	with sin I actually need to mess with her
1549920	1551920	because unfortunately
1551920	1553920	I need to delay that stream due to
1553920	1555920	obligations
1557920	1559920	because essentially week 3
1559920	1561920	is Elden Ring and then it would be week 4
1561920	1563920	Elden Ring with sin and
1563920	1565920	I think that would
1565920	1567920	alienate
1567920	1569920	too many
1569920	1571920	supporters being like oh god
1571920	1573920	get off that game already
1573920	1575920	you can do it
1575920	1577920	don't let you get in the way
1577920	1579920	don't let yourself get in the way
1579920	1581920	honestly
1581920	1583920	I do have a fun update for those of you
1583920	1585920	who enjoy seeing my hands
1585920	1587920	I have successfully ordered
1587920	1589920	the Uwu Market
1589920	1591920	keychains
1591920	1593920	and merchandise
1593920	1595920	like I bought my own merchandise
1595920	1597920	type thing but I got a discount code
1597920	1599920	and all that I've got the keychains
1599920	1601920	of all the girls coming
1601920	1603920	so I'm going to do
1603920	1605920	like a little hand ASMR soon
1605920	1607920	for anyone
1607920	1609920	now don't worry this content
1609920	1611920	will be made public that I'm about to discuss
1611920	1613920	for anyone who is currently
1613920	1615920	on Patreon
1615920	1617920	they got early access to
1617920	1619920	a YouTube video
1619920	1621920	which was absolutely outrageous
1621920	1623920	but I'm just wanting to
1623920	1625920	know if anyone in chat
1625920	1627920	did listen to that outrageous
1627920	1629920	audio and what were your thoughts about it
1629920	1631920	um
1631920	1633920	I'm also using my Patreon
1633920	1635920	as a
1635920	1637920	big archive of anything that I produce
1637920	1639920	sadly
1639920	1641920	4 audios are unable to be
1641920	1643920	uploaded to it because I was
1643920	1645920	very dumb
1645920	1647920	I've made a 4 part
1647920	1649920	series
1649920	1651920	that has hypnosis
1651920	1653920	in it but Patreon actually doesn't allow
1653920	1655920	that
1655920	1657920	so I'm going to upload it on my
1657920	1659920	Twitter for free not a problem
1659920	1661920	I just need to edit it and get out of the way
1661920	1663920	but it means
1663920	1665920	I'm now missing 4 audios
1665920	1667920	um
1667920	1669920	raw tuna
1669920	1671920	that's cooked that's cooked that's cooked
1671920	1673920	that's cooked so
1673920	1675920	Lobster's tuna and then we tackle
1675920	1677920	the 10k freaking
1677920	1679920	swordfish
1679920	1681920	this is going to be interesting
1681920	1683920	I keep running out of love
1683920	1685920	um
1685920	1687920	the hoodies
1687920	1689920	no nothing is limited by Ubu Market
1689920	1691920	um
1691920	1693920	actually I need to talk to them again
1693920	1695920	because
1695920	1697920	Azura is coming up
1697920	1699920	um
1699920	1701920	y'all
1701920	1703920	why does he not like hypnosis
1703920	1705920	Mastercard
1705920	1707920	our unloved overlords
1707920	1709920	have deemed that
1709920	1711920	hypnosis isn't
1711920	1713920	consensual for some reason
1713920	1715920	even though it fully is like you will never
1715920	1717920	do something that you don't want to do
1717920	1719920	um
1719920	1721920	and unfortunately
1721920	1723920	Patreon always have to bend the knee
1723920	1725920	a lot of people have issues with Patreon
1725920	1727920	but the reality of the situation is
1727920	1729920	our overlords that we despise
1729920	1731920	the ones who are on Epstein Island
1731920	1733920	all the time
1733920	1735920	but deem hypnosis as non consensual
1735920	1737920	so it cannot be
1737920	1739920	uploaded to Patreon however
1739920	1741920	um
1741920	1743920	I'm going to say something and this is a bit controversial
1743920	1745920	but guess what
1745920	1747920	Elon Musk announced that Twitter is absolutely
1747920	1749920	fine with that kind of content
1749920	1751920	so I'm sorry but one up on Elon
1751920	1753920	Musk because he couldn't give less of a rat's
1753920	1755920	arse and to be honest
1755920	1757920	that's kind of what I'm looking for when it comes to
1757920	1759920	just making content
1759920	1761920	we're all adults here we're all doing our thing
1761920	1763920	like there's no need for
1763920	1765920	all these things going on
1765920	1767920	uh
1767920	1769920	but yeah
1769920	1771920	uh
1771920	1773920	yes um so unfortunately
1773920	1775920	it means I have four missing loot
1775920	1777920	oh I shouldn't say those words
1777920	1779920	sorry four inkable
1779920	1781920	audios so I need to go
1781920	1783920	like record so
1783920	1785920	I'm not actually sure what my
1785920	1787920	fourth upload this month is going to be on Patreon
1787920	1789920	because
1789920	1791920	um
1791920	1793920	originally it was supposed to be
1793920	1795920	a part one of this series
1795920	1797920	but it's not possible
1797920	1799920	um
1799920	1801920	yes
1801920	1803920	yes
1803920	1805920	um but yeah did you like the audio
1805920	1807920	for those of you who are on Patreon
1807920	1809920	because it was absolutely outrageous
1809920	1811920	you can probably monetize twitter eventually
1811920	1813920	oh you need
1813920	1815920	five million impressions I'm not sure we're there
1815920	1817920	unless like well she
1817920	1819920	stares
1819920	1821920	and Mercy
1821920	1823920	managed to get caught in the algorithm
1823920	1825920	when
1825920	1827920	this new meta came up
1827920	1829920	so they actually probably do
1829920	1831920	have that
1831920	1833920	um
1833920	1835920	but uh
1835920	1837920	yeah like if twitter is like
1837920	1839920	oh I burnt all of them
1839920	1841920	I have five
1841920	1843920	lobbies out of that that's terrible
1843920	1845920	ooh
1845920	1847920	that was a really rough run right lobbies
1847920	1849920	we've got 500
1849920	1851920	let's see how much we just absolutely
1851920	1853920	waste honestly
1853920	1855920	I'll do the camera and go like that
1855920	1857920	eh
1857920	1859920	it was very unhinged that ASMR
1859920	1861920	yeah
1861920	1863920	I thought it was hilarious I was like
1863920	1865920	freaking jumping around the mic
1865920	1867920	I was doing like backflips trying to like
1867920	1869920	come over and like get it louder and stuff
1869920	1871920	do you know how many I put so many
1871920	1873920	like noise dampening filters
1873920	1875920	on the audio as well
1875920	1877920	but the clap was so loud
1877920	1879920	it was outrageous
1879920	1881920	um
1881920	1883920	I don't know if it'll survive on youtube
1883920	1885920	but I'll still upload it as a yolo anyway
1885920	1887920	cause it's hilarious and I don't care
1887920	1889920	and to be honest
1889920	1891920	I never really did anything that outrageous
1891920	1893920	cause it's just sound like to me it's like
1893920	1895920	just the sound of someone clapping their hands
1895920	1897920	okay it's just what's actually
1897920	1899920	happening that's a bit outrageous
1899920	1901920	but because there's no audio it's fain
1901920	1903920	eh so because
1903920	1905920	there's no visual unhinged
1905920	1907920	isn't a negative thing
1907920	1909920	the audio is the reason
1909920	1911920	eh
1911920	1913920	I'll have to go stuff to see the
1913920	1915920	7th grade
1915920	1917920	yeah basically I did clapping ASMR
1917920	1919920	but I didn't use my
1919920	1921920	hands
1921920	1923920	I wonder
1923920	1925920	well I'm gonna see if I can get some fish
1925920	1927920	I don't need any more fish if it's for me
1927920	1929920	I'm sure you've got 10k swordfish
1931920	1933920	um but yeah
1933920	1935920	that's the audio I made
1935920	1937920	oh my god we've almost leveled up again
1939920	1941920	54
1941920	1943920	that's fantastic
1943920	1945920	what a genius entrepreneur truly
1947920	1949920	I fell asleep to the begging one
1949920	1951920	really?
1951920	1953920	that was so popular
1953920	1955920	I definitely hit the algorithm
1955920	1957920	because
1957920	1959920	well someone said on one of my
1959920	1961920	ASMR stream
1961920	1963920	wait what happened there
1963920	1965920	someone said on my ASMR stream
1965920	1967920	that
1967920	1969920	I was on tiktok
1969920	1971920	feature page
1971920	1973920	but um
1973920	1975920	vealer doesn't upload to tiktok
1975920	1977920	we've reserved everyone's name on tiktok
1977920	1979920	just in case
1979920	1981920	but it's more important to do youtube
1981920	1983920	shorts vs tiktok
1983920	1985920	like over that kind of thing
1985920	1987920	um
1987920	1989920	what liquid you put on your
1989920	1991920	not hands I heard you spray something
1991920	1993920	at the beginning
1993920	1995920	oh it's coconut oil
1995920	1997920	it's oil
1997920	1999920	in the audio
1999920	2001920	you can hear me take off my prel
2001920	2003920	I left that in on purpose
2003920	2005920	because I breathed
2005920	2007920	heavily through it and I was like
2007920	2009920	I'll edit this out but then I was like
2009920	2011920	oh maybe someone would enjoy it
2011920	2013920	so I just left it in
2013920	2015920	so you can literally hear me take off my weapon drew
2015920	2017920	an armor
2017920	2019920	nudge nudge
2021920	2023920	tiktok clippers
2023920	2025920	no like um so on tiktok
2025920	2027920	it's called
2027920	2029920	a video format it's called tiktok
2029920	2031920	whereas youtube it's called a short
2031920	2033920	and twitch it's a clip
2033920	2035920	but it's all the same thing
2035920	2037920	oh I leveled up I got
2037920	2039920	54 oh my gosh
2039920	2041920	maybe 78 is gonna be
2041920	2043920	like way before like at the rate
2043920	2045920	we're doing these lobbies
2047920	2049920	um coconut
2049920	2051920	my beloved
2051920	2053920	ah thank you
2053920	2055920	um oh my god that voice crack
2055920	2057920	70 is fast yeah I feel like maybe
2057920	2059920	I might have
2059920	2061920	underestimated how much we're gonna get
2063920	2065920	the little extra sounds add a lot
2065920	2067920	oh right so I can actually tell you
2067920	2069920	the behind the scenes of recording the coconut clapping
2069920	2071920	let's call it the coconut clapping
2071920	2073920	that'll be our code word for it
2073920	2075920	um so
2075920	2077920	the reason why you hear me go
2077920	2079920	oh and then
2079920	2081920	I do it is because I had to hold on
2081920	2083920	to my
2083920	2085920	my gooblies because they were
2085920	2087920	bumping
2087920	2089920	and jumping because of like
2089920	2091920	in order to make
2091920	2093920	um your buns of steel
2093920	2095920	clap you have to like go up and down
2095920	2097920	quite not violently
2097920	2099920	but you have to make it quite fast that's something
2099920	2101920	sometimes I do it slowly and then sometimes
2101920	2103920	it's like one after
2103920	2105920	what I'd clap that coconut
2105920	2107920	I mean what the cool thing
2107920	2109920	is that you can fully unleash the Scottish accent
2109920	2111920	does that mean it tastes like coconut
2111920	2113920	I mean right now probably
2113920	2115920	oh I should do that smell trend
2115920	2117920	I keep forgetting coconut clapping
2117920	2119920	like want to bite them
2119920	2121920	if you cook at a range next to where you're burning
2121920	2123920	ah I can't be bothered moving though
2123920	2125920	I want to stay with my reeflings at the fire
2125920	2127920	I was gone for five just strong
2127920	2129920	he died no I'm level
2129920	2131920	54 we've
2131920	2133920	just came to realize I've probably
2133920	2135920	severely underestimated that we're
2135920	2137920	achieved 70 this stream
2137920	2139920	we are most likely going to have
2139920	2141920	a lot more than that
2141920	2143920	um
2143920	2145920	aggressively clapping coconut
2145920	2147920	well at one minute I was like I feel like
2147920	2149920	um saw
2149920	2151920	I think I said saw but what I meant was
2151920	2153920	jaws that shark like that din din
2153920	2155920	cause I was away I went
2155920	2157920	walked further away from the microphone
2157920	2159920	and then came closer and it was like
2159920	2161920	din din din din clap clap
2161920	2163920	din din din clap clap clap clap
2163920	2165920	this is one of the most ridiculous
2165920	2167920	audios I've ever made but
2167920	2169920	I got halfway
2169920	2171920	through editing my
2171920	2173920	first
2173920	2175920	1k thank you
2175920	2177920	oh wait I've got salmon sugar
2177920	2179920	I didn't notice that salmon there
2179920	2181920	wait I'll finish off the salmon
2181920	2183920	um
2183920	2185920	I got halfway through
2185920	2187920	finishing my first like 1000
2187920	2189920	special ASMR
2189920	2191920	and it's just me rambling
2191920	2193920	in dune tingles it honestly
2193920	2195920	probably feels like a live stream like
2195920	2197920	when I just start rambling whilst I'm doing tingles
2197920	2199920	but like I was having so much fun
2199920	2201920	like
2201920	2203920	being like guess what this is
2203920	2205920	oh my god this is actually a sponge I don't know
2205920	2207920	if you could guess that type thing like I was
2207920	2209920	just getting so excited so it doesn't
2209920	2211920	sound like ASMR again
2211920	2213920	from the aster
2213920	2215920	tuber
2215920	2217920	I like 92 is halfway to
2217920	2219920	99 XP wise

2345920	2347920	literally the girl
2347920	2349920	as far as I'm aware the girls are happy
2349920	2351920	they can pick what they want do what they want
2351920	2353920	um unfortunately
2353920	2355920	because
2355920	2357920	Azura and
2357920	2359920	Emmy are on a warning
2359920	2361920	um
2361920	2363920	by juicy youtube thanks to their

2375920	2377920	oh
2377920	2379920	unfortunately I've not
2379920	2381920	well I've kind of discouraged them
2381920	2383920	for doing ASMR until the warning is up
2383920	2385920	because it's very dangerous
2385920	2387920	if they get a strike
2387920	2389920	I'm like brav
2389920	2391920	YouTube please
2391920	2393920	I'm back
2393920	2395920	I got distracted oh don't worry

2397920	2399920	don't worry we're doing an endurance today
2399920	2401920	I have had so many short streams
2401920	2403920	this week it felt so weird
2403920	2405920	like
2405920	2407920	I do have a lot of time to like finally start editing
2407920	2409920	I have a heck of a lot
2409920	2411920	of VTuber ASMR collabs
2411920	2413920	coming through I wrote an ASMR
2413920	2415920	collab for two of the girls
2415920	2417920	and they all were together
2417920	2419920	um
2419920	2421920	and
2421920	2423920	the girls
2423920	2425920	one of them reacted and thought the plot
2425920	2427920	was adorable
2427920	2429920	it's just super basic short plot
2429920	2431920	I never want to overwhelm the girls
2431920	2433920	with anything that I assign them
2433920	2435920	so please don't think it's like some super mega
2435920	2437920	do do do do do
2437920	2439920	I know
2439920	2441920	that there is a collab with Mercy

2457920	2459920	Mercy's time zone
2459920	2461920	like when she normally streams
2461920	2463920	so basically we're going to play
2463920	2465920	RuneScape for a solid
2465920	2467920	chunk and then I'm going to go offline
2467920	2469920	and rest my voice for like an hour
2469920	2471920	or two
2471920	2473920	hours because I'll be in voice call
2473920	2475920	with Mercy one hour before
2475920	2477920	the collab if you didn't know
2477920	2479920	it is common courtesy for VTubers
2479920	2481920	to show up one hour before
2481920	2483920	a collab which is where you
2483920	2485920	do all of your
2485920	2487920	um technical
2487920	2489920	failures as I had with
2489920	2491920	flipping
2491920	2493920	again special shout out to
2493920	2495920	Shibi for keeping my head on my shoulders
2495920	2497920	I was panicking when
2497920	2499920	we could not do it up
2499920	2501920	and
2501920	2503920	she's grinding so fast
2503920	2505920	baby won't you
2505920	2507920	grind on me
2507920	2509920	relax your mind
2509920	2511920	church your time
2511920	2513920	will move
2513920	2515920	that's all I know of that song
2515920	2517920	I got one cake carambua
2517920	2519920	of the pussy
2519920	2521920	wow
2521920	2523920	when you start cooking members food
2523920	2525920	I have like
2525920	2527920	10,000 swordfish to go through
2527920	2529920	I have no idea what even potential
2529920	2531920	XP that might is
2531920	2533920	that might is okay
2533920	2535920	well one you're done what English was that
2539920	2541920	um is that a threat or a promise
2543920	2545920	um oh I was gonna
2545920	2547920	do marshmallows
2547920	2549920	actually I've got such nice
2549920	2551920	marshmallows you guys need to stop being so nice to me
2551920	2553920	because if I get emotional
2553920	2555920	and start reading them I start getting
2555920	2557920	teary-eyed and I'm like I can't handle these
2557920	2559920	right now because it's gonna like make me cry
2559920	2561920	like happy tears
2561920	2563920	um so you guys need to stop being so nice to me
2567920	2569920	there's currently a riflin
2569920	2571920	um
2571920	2573920	who's keeping me updated about their addiction
2573920	2575920	right now and they're like
2575920	2577920	I don't even feel the need to go back to my addiction
2577920	2579920	I'm like oh my god you're kicking your addiction
2579920	2581920	I'm like how
2581920	2583920	how are you what how
2583920	2585920	like that's amazing like I could get into
2585920	2587920	the nitty-gritty of like how insane addiction
2587920	2589920	is and look
2589920	2591920	your brain once it creates
2591920	2593920	a neural pathway it likes it wants to keep repeating
2593920	2595920	that it's nice and easy it's why nostalgia
2595920	2597920	is so powerful because you don't have to like
2597920	2599920	learn the new lore of something
2599920	2601920	it sounds silly but
2601920	2603920	um
2603920	2605920	like it's very easy
2605920	2607920	to fall into addiction
2607920	2609920	and especially
2609920	2611920	your makeup your genetic
2611920	2613920	makeup can make you predispositioned
2613920	2615920	for it as well it's quite it's quite fascinating
2615920	2617920	because it's like it's kind of like
2617920	2619920	gamba like I spoke previously
2619920	2621920	I had a
2621920	2623920	advertisement offer
2623920	2625920	of four thousand US dollars
2625920	2627920	to insert a 60 second
2627920	2629920	gamba ad
2629920	2631920	and I said no because
2631920	2633920	it's gamba
2633920	2635920	but it's very interesting
2635920	2637920	how
2637920	2639920	severely gamba seems to
2639920	2641920	affect individuals
2641920	2643920	now this is just an observation
2643920	2645920	but whenever I've seen
2645920	2647920	gamba ads that are like stop when the fund
2647920	2649920	stops a ten thousand
2649920	2651920	swordfish should get you to level 78
2651920	2653920	let's go oh my god
2653920	2655920	78 by the end of the stream
2655920	2657920	um
2657920	2659920	whenever you see a gamba ad that's like don't
2659920	2661920	is like stop stop when the fund stops
2661920	2663920	they always show a guy
2663920	2665920	and I'm wondering
2665920	2667920	um
2667920	2669920	not the pre
2669920	2671920	the socialization
2671920	2673920	because obviously if we're being
2673920	2675920	very stereotypical of society
2675920	2677920	we live in a society
2677920	2679920	guys are normally more interested in
2679920	2681920	sports and
2681920	2683920	is the environment around it that it's
2683920	2685920	normal to gamble
2685920	2687920	and kind of like put a cheeky
2687920	2689920	a tenner here on this
2689920	2691920	bet a 20
2691920	2693920	quid here on this bet type thing
2693920	2695920	before it snowballs out of control
2695920	2697920	it's quite
2697920	2699920	fascinating I actually had someone
2699920	2701920	in real life I knew
2701920	2703920	that
2703920	2705920	they weren't a family member
2705920	2707920	but they were like an acquaintance and I learned
2707920	2709920	of their story
2709920	2711920	and basically
2711920	2713920	the guy gambled away their mortgage
2713920	2715920	and
2715920	2717920	it's just
2717920	2719920	it's such a shame what kind of
2719920	2721920	grip it has
2721920	2723920	on certain people because
2723920	2725920	for me right now
2725920	2727920	I
2727920	2729920	I'm like confident that I don't
2729920	2731920	have that kind of addiction
2731920	2733920	I
2733920	2735920	I don't it doesn't appeal to me
2735920	2737920	I would I would walk away
2737920	2739920	like angry that I wasted
2739920	2741920	my money type thing like my brain
2741920	2743920	doesn't go oh
2743920	2745920	if I gamble again I'll make back
2745920	2747920	what I lost like no my brain's like
2747920	2749920	what a waste of time that was I'd rather play
2749920	2751920	like a video game or something else like that
2751920	2753920	you know
2753920	2755920	I wish I could join you but not on
2755920	2757920	RuneScape wait what's wrong with RuneScape
2757920	2759920	it's old school
2759920	2761920	look these are all reeflings we're all just hanging
2761920	2763920	out outside the we're all hanging
2763920	2765920	out in Edgeville for no particular
2765920	2767920	reason
2767920	2769920	um
2769920	2771920	yeah sorry I don't know if
2771920	2773920	I need to turn down the
2775920	2777920	that sound effect yeah
2777920	2779920	I'll turn down the sound effect just because
2779920	2781920	it's very repetitive
2781920	2783920	and hopefully you can still
2783920	2785920	kind of hear a bit
2785920	2787920	sorry
2787920	2789920	we're in Edgeville together you can do better
2789920	2791920	90% of gamblers quit
2791920	2793920	before they've been big now I have seen
2793920	2795920	those memes I have to admit they're a wee bit funny
2795920	2797920	but it is
2797920	2799920	just a very curious
2801920	2803920	predicament that people seem to get
2803920	2805920	themselves into I mean that's kind of what
2805920	2807920	kick the website kick.com
2807920	2809920	if you heard about it
2809920	2811920	the only
2811920	2813920	reason they are able to be
2813920	2815920	fueled so high is because
2815920	2817920	of Gambo
2817920	2819920	there's no other
2819920	2821920	reason and it's perfectly
2821920	2823920	fine to say that
2825920	2827920	but it just kind of goes to show
2827920	2829920	you how big the house always
2829920	2831920	wins if they can offer this
2831920	2833920	business model on the side like I
2833920	2835920	remember I don't know if you guys remember
2835920	2837920	when Twitch like officially announced
2837920	2839920	it's like banning Gambo
2841920	2843920	it's just very curious
2843920	2845920	because
2845920	2847920	there's a lot of
2847920	2849920	discussion you can get into and you can say
2849920	2851920	well the person that's Gambo
2851920	2853920	and it's their money
2853920	2855920	it's their life
2855920	2857920	it's their choice
2857920	2859920	but if like
2859920	2861920	the oh I'm trying to
2861920	2863920	think and do two things at once and it's not coming out in a
2863920	2865920	sense so
2867920	2869920	is it the
2869920	2871920	right hold on hold on let me put my sense together
2873920	2875920	when is it not a choice
2875920	2877920	when is it not a choice is the
2877920	2879920	question why is it it's
2879920	2881920	addiction and not a choice when it comes
2881920	2883920	to Gambo but it
2883920	2885920	might be a choice when it comes to other bad
2885920	2887920	actions you might do in your life
2887920	2889920	why is Gambo marked out for one
2889920	2891920	why is alcoholism marked out for one
2891920	2893920	obviously when it comes to alcoholism
2893920	2895920	your body does change the tolerance
2895920	2897920	but you could argue the same for Gambo
2897920	2899920	because your brain literally
2899920	2901920	lights up like fireworks
2901920	2903920	when you win
2903920	2905920	and
2905920	2907920	it's just very interesting because where's
2907920	2909920	the line drawn from someone is consenting
2909920	2911920	to do this activity and someone
2911920	2913920	isn't able to consent to do this activity
2913920	2915920	because it's causing harm because
2915920	2917920	you could argue sitting on runescape
2917920	2919920	for 12 hours well that's causing harm
2919920	2921920	oh well
2921920	2923920	we'll need to take her offline
2923920	2925920	because she's not well because she's doing this
2925920	2927920	for 12 hours because that's bad
2927920	2929920	for her health sitting for 12 hours
2929920	2931920	type thing you know
2931920	2933920	like do you know what I'm trying to like say out loud
2933920	2935920	I struggle to say the words
2935920	2937920	RATMA thank you for coming
2937920	2939920	I'll member to your destructive behaviors
2939920	2941920	that have historically
2941920	2943920	been deemed as vices that's where it is
2943920	2945920	yeah like we're being
2945920	2947920	called out literally all runescapers
2947920	2949920	getting called out from across the line
2949920	2951920	wow we're about to level up again
2951920	2953920	oh my god just hit just let me
2953920	2955920	do one ramble and we're gonna be
2955920	2957920	99 overnight like just
2957920	2959920	give me one subject to ramble
2959920	2961920	about and we're done there is a log out
2961920	2963920	timer after six hours and I will
2963920	2965920	most likely log me out when I go for the big job
2965920	2967920	I don't need one right now
2967920	2969920	um
2969920	2971920	but yeah
2971920	2973920	me and college maxing on runescape
2973920	2975920	citizen homework real
2975920	2977920	the lanes do get but well that's
2977920	2979920	it's the interesting thing it's like when
2979920	2981920	where do laws come into place to
2981920	2983920	protect gamba
2983920	2985920	gamblers sorry
2985920	2987920	um because when you lose
2987920	2989920	your money you're told tough
2989920	2991920	tough bananas
2991920	2993920	yeah 56
2993920	2995920	yatta
2995920	2997920	when you lose all your money you're told
2997920	2999920	tough bananas
2999920	3001920	when you lose your money to a scam
3001920	3003920	the bank says see tough bananas
3003920	3005920	yeah there's laws in place to
3005920	3007920	protect you in quotation marks and to
3007920	3009920	get um the scammers
3009920	3011920	put in jail to get well you can't
3011920	3013920	really put um
3013920	3015920	casinos in jail so that doesn't work
3015920	3017920	uh that's a terrible
3017920	3019920	uh comparison
3019920	3021920	um
3021920	3023920	hmm
3023920	3025920	hmm well
3025920	3027920	I've kind of shot myself in that line of
3027920	3029920	line of thought I've uh completely undone
3029920	3031920	my that line of thought there I do apologize
3031920	3033920	um
3033920	3035920	yes yes yes yes
3035920	3037920	there's really no good answer no there
3037920	3039920	isn't that's the thing
3039920	3041920	that's the thing that's the thing I want
3041920	3043920	to highlight there is
3043920	3045920	no answer and
3045920	3047920	yet we still have some laws
3047920	3049920	such as you know obviously twitch
3049920	3051920	isn't law but twitch is a reflection
3051920	3053920	of the community views
3053920	3055920	or the community the views of the masses
3055920	3057920	now do you remember
3057920	3059920	when uh
3059920	3061920	wikimane was like yeah gamba bad
3061920	3063920	and then all of a sudden twitter
3063920	3065920	blew up and then twitter was like
3065920	3067920	gamba bad and then twitch
3067920	3069920	was like okay now we'll remove
3069920	3071920	gamba like
3071920	3073920	that is a perfect
3073920	3075920	example of
3075920	3077920	the most basic movement now don't
3077920	3079920	get me wrong movement isn't world changing
3079920	3081920	but it is the basic example
3081920	3083920	of someone who definitely
3083920	3085920	has a larger platform even denying it
3085920	3087920	going hey this thing
3087920	3089920	bad and then everyone going
3089920	3091920	wait a minute yes
3091920	3093920	this thing is bad
3093920	3095920	and then boom
3095920	3097920	twitch
3097920	3099920	got rid of the category
3099920	3101920	and outlawed it and said no bad
3101920	3103920	now that is
3103920	3105920	and just
3105920	3107920	a bloody perfect example
3107920	3109920	of how
3109920	3111920	the community
3111920	3113920	the community in
3113920	3115920	specific areas and pockets
3115920	3117920	do have a voice
3117920	3119920	and do have a say
3119920	3121920	as much as you might not think on an individual
3121920	3123920	level you don't have a voice
3123920	3125920	it might be true but have you ever
3125920	3127920	seen planet of the apes
3127920	3129920	monkey on own
3129920	3131920	weak
3131920	3133920	monkey together strong
3133920	3135920	it is true
3135920	3137920	you can't even deny it there's so many
3137920	3139920	examples of this
3139920	3141920	like think of revolutions
3141920	3143920	such as the french revolution
3143920	3145920	one individual would get their head
3145920	3147920	guillotined okay
3147920	3149920	I'm not being funny I'm being so
3149920	3151920	true this is my rabbit hole
3151920	3153920	but like literally the french
3153920	3155920	revolution one person stands up
3155920	3157920	and gets their head chopped off right
3157920	3159920	no revolution no movement
3159920	3161920	community is not you know
3161920	3163920	community is not going to rise up
3163920	3165920	but hold on a minute the people are revolting
3165920	3167920	the people are
3167920	3169920	revolting the masses are outraged
3169920	3171920	how can society continue
3171920	3173920	if everyone bands together
3173920	3175920	and
3175920	3177920	historically every 400 years
3177920	3179920	society
3179920	3181920	shifts and what do I mean by
3181920	3183920	society shifts something new
3183920	3185920	comes up for society to be
3185920	3187920	a part of okay
3187920	3189920	so before capitalism
3189920	3191920	which is when global
3191920	3193920	economics became a thing
3193920	3195920	the industrial revolution
3195920	3197920	global economics there was
3197920	3199920	region locked capitalism
3199920	3201920	okay and it's called feudalism
3201920	3203920	or something like that it's like
3203920	3205920	it's not feudalism it's like feudalism
3205920	3207920	okay
3207920	3209920	which was when
3209920	3211920	lords owned
3211920	3213920	the plots of land and permitted
3213920	3215920	peasants to generate food
3215920	3217920	on those lands okay
3217920	3219920	that was region locked capitalism
3219920	3221920	before we know capitalism today
3221920	3223920	okay but that got outdated
3223920	3225920	when the revolution came in
3225920	3227920	because you know
3227920	3229920	people learn fast to
3229920	3231920	grow certain crops
3231920	3233920	and if you breed crops I can't remember
3233920	3235920	who did the crop breeding
3235920	3237920	what's his name
3237920	3239920	I've forgotten
3239920	3241920	feudalism is with lords yes
3241920	3243920	yes the chickens are revolting
3243920	3245920	finally we agree on something
3245920	3247920	bro it's not 400 years it's like a decade
3247920	3249920	stuff changes all the time
3249920	3251920	but like another massive example
3251920	3253920	of a shift in society
3253920	3255920	some of yous are not going to like this
3255920	3257920	you're in for a rambling stream
3257920	3259920	you've got me for 12 hours
3259920	3261920	as if I'm not going to get on my high horse and teach you history
3261920	3263920	okay
3263920	3265920	if you did not know
3265920	3267920	in Christianity
3267920	3269920	there's the Old Testament
3269920	3271920	and there's the New Testament
3271920	3273920	the New Testament
3273920	3275920	was created
3275920	3277920	I believe
3277920	3279920	in roughly the 15th century
3279920	3281920	the church got together
3281920	3283920	and went look the Old Testament
3283920	3285920	isn't doing it for the masses
3285920	3287920	people are starting to question that
3287920	3289920	because people are becoming aware
3289920	3291920	that you know
3291920	3293920	some things aren't working out
3293920	3295920	in this story
3295920	3297920	and basically
3297920	3299920	the New Testament is just
3299920	3301920	friggin made up
3301920	3303920	1500
3303920	3305920	years later after
3305920	3307920	Jebus the source
3307920	3309920	supposedly passed away
3309920	3311920	you're so right strongy let's eat the rich
3311920	3313920	fondly thank you for this too
3315920	3317920	like some people can't conceptualise
3317920	3319920	the difference between a million and a billion
3319920	3321920	dollars
3321920	3323920	now take that million
3323920	3325920	and add one and then add one and then add one
3325920	3327920	then add one and keep going and keep going and keep going
3327920	3329920	and keep going and keep going
3329920	3331920	but anyway
3331920	3333920	casually red fill in the masses
3333920	3335920	bruv I'm not kidding I will keep mentioning
3335920	3337920	the game
3337920	3339920	needy streamer overload
3339920	3341920	I don't believe they put that in the game
3341920	3343920	that kind of thing
3343920	3345920	but anyway
3345920	3347920	anyway that's just me
3347920	3349920	I don't know what you guys are thinking
3349920	3351920	but that's just me
3351920	3353920	but I could really get on my high horse
3353920	3355920	I should actually I want to do an education stream
3355920	3357920	about feudalism
3357920	3359920	because
3359920	3361920	and kind of how history and how society used to work
3361920	3363920	because bargaining used to be how
3363920	3365920	it was done
3365920	3367920	bargaining used to be like hey
3367920	3369920	two weeks
3369920	3371920	would you trade me one potato for two
3371920	3373920	weeks that's how it used to be done
3373920	3375920	that's how there was value in things
3375920	3377920	that's how humans
3377920	3379920	did it and
3379920	3381920	there are
3381920	3383920	there are some examples today
3383920	3385920	of it kind of thriving
3385920	3387920	and
3387920	3389920	so runescape is historically
3389920	3391920	accurate yes
3391920	3393920	you guys trading me right now
3393920	3395920	you are calling upon your ancestors
3395920	3397920	to give me the resources that you don't need
3397920	3399920	in the moment
3399920	3401920	you are looking after me and in return
3401920	3403920	I will scratch your back later
3403920	3405920	it's literally why I'm such a big believer
3405920	3407920	and you scratch my back I scratch yours
3407920	3409920	because that's how it used to be
3409920	3411920	return to monkey
3411920	3413920	replays return to monkey
3413920	3415920	we were so nice
3415920	3417920	we had some communities
3417920	3419920	we had said it's a belonging
3419920	3421920	it's so
3421920	3423920	nice
3423920	3425920	the old test schools
3425920	3427920	I'm curious
3427920	3429920	I've not touched old schools runescape
3429920	3431920	what's with the cooking not cooking window
3431920	3433920	on the top left so I am using
3433920	3435920	a plugin called runelight
3435920	3437920	you can see it up here this plugin
3437920	3439920	can track your things
3439920	3441920	there are good bad examples of this

4125920	4127920	a vtuber collab on halo
4127920	4129920	but
4129920	4131920	I don't know anyone who's played halo
4131920	4133920	I will ask the violour girls
4133920	4135920	first before I ask around
4135920	4137920	and see if anyone's played halo
4137920	4139920	um
4139920	4141920	not that you need to be
4141920	4143920	um good at halo
4143920	4145920	to play it like you need to know about it
4145920	4147920	but I'd rather
4147920	4149920	I think if you're playing a nostalgic
4149920	4151920	game I'd rather like two people who are
4151920	4153920	familiar with it play and that sounds
4153920	4155920	really rude I hope it doesn't come across as rude
4155920	4157920	but I mean
4157920	4159920	I'm sure there's another halo vtuber that's
4159920	4161920	freaking played random question

4235920	4237920	any other way
4237920	4239920	me trying to hold in her

4247920	4249920	um
4249920	4251920	but yeah
4251920	4253920	the
4253920	4255920	already levelled up again
4255920	4257920	literally I am rambling through these levels
4257920	4259920	like nothing on earth
4259920	4261920	like I wake up on the other side of the ramble
4261920	4263920	and we're literally 58
4263920	4265920	that's fantastic
4265920	4267920	oh my goodness
4267920	4269920	all these lobbies
4269920	4271920	I'm burning them a wee bit but it's fine
4271920	4273920	okay you and emmy agree hard
4273920	4275920	on that ending yeah
4275920	4277920	literally I'm sorry but why on earth would you make
4277920	4279920	why would you
4279920	4281920	why would you play the game and be like
4281920	4283920	uh I'm not gonna do that ending
4283920	4285920	no the whole point is to like
4285920	4287920	be fine with human curiosity
4287920	4289920	like as long as you don't produce any offspring
4289920	4291920	no one gives a rest
4291920	4293920	no one gives a
4293920	4295920	honestly
4295920	4297920	um
4297920	4299920	hmm
4299920	4301920	halo would be a fun way to do community games
4301920	4303920	uh like the halo molly
4303920	4305920	player I never actually played much of it
4305920	4307920	I heard
4307920	4309920	the bat
4309920	4311920	was it a halo battle pass came out
4311920	4313920	and it was just an absolute shambles
4313920	4315920	like it was just a terrible
4315920	4317920	multiplayer launch
4317920	4319920	and it and then they did battle
4319920	4321920	pass and then it just became
4321920	4323920	like this terrible
4323920	4325920	thing I don't know
4325920	4327920	what ending the one
4327920	4329920	true ending
4329920	4331920	oh actually
4331920	4333920	I was lurking quite a lot someone was like
4333920	4335920	wait I don't get it are we emmy's brother
4335920	4337920	the reason why you can
4337920	4339920	see emmy at all times when she streams
4339920	4341920	is because you're her dead brother
4341920	4343920	watching over her
4343920	4345920	I will spell it out for you
4345920	4347920	you are her
4347920	4349920	dead brother watching over her
4349920	4351920	which is why you can see her stream
4351920	4353920	which is why you can see her thoughts
4353920	4355920	on twitter okay
4355920	4357920	I'll spell it out for you
4359920	4361920	the pin pals that don't get it

4379920	4381920	and it's like a super small game
4381920	4383920	em if it's a small game

4462920	4464920	the income generated
4464920	4466920	veiler do not take a cut
4466920	4468920	and the girls can attest to that
4468920	4470920	em we don't have
4470920	4472920	anything to do with it
4472920	4474920	and it completely and wholeheartedly supports them
4474920	4476920	if you wanted to
4476920	4478920	collect all the key chains of the girls
4478920	4480920	that could be something very sweet and cute
4480920	4482920	that's what I'm doing and I'm gonna make an ASMR
4482920	4484920	of me tapping it with my little fake
4484920	4486920	mermaid nails that I showed on my handcam stream

4496920	4498920	I'm so glad
4498920	4500920	that the girls can see their hard effort
4500920	4502920	pay off right away
4502920	4504920	they've been nothing but fantastic

4516920	4518920	absolutely fantastic to work with
4518920	4520920	em they are
4520920	4522920	super good I am aware
4522920	4524920	that they got a bit of flat
4524920	4526920	cause of some production issues
4526920	4528920	but they actually moved
4528920	4530920	em they moved
4530920	4532920	locations quite a few times
4532920	4534920	cause their business expanded so fast
4534920	4536920	that they basically had growing pains
4536920	4538920	but I have never personally
4538920	4540920	had an issue with them now I know that's
4540920	4542920	kinda being like well you never had an issue
4542920	4544920	with others that's just dismissing the others
4544920	4546920	relax I understand how it works
4546920	4548920	but em to work with
4548920	4550920	ubu market they've been
4550920	4552920	they were so understanding from the get go
4552920	4554920	cause I messaged them and I'm like
4554920	4556920	hey violers the thing
4556920	4558920	I'd love it if the girls can keep 100%
4558920	4560920	of the earnings
4560920	4562920	we as the company don't want to take a cut
4562920	4564920	and they're like yeah we can set that up
4564920	4566920	no problem and I was like here
4566920	4568920	here's all the references to the artwork
4568920	4570920	yeah we can do that no problem
4570920	4572920	and just they've handled everything
4572920	4574920	and it has been really nice
4574920	4576920	to not have to deal with anything
4576920	4578920	it makes things nice
4578920	4580920	and juicy and easy
4580920	4582920	em
4582920	4584920	one of the things, few things about
4584920	4586920	violers the lack of corporation greed
4586920	4588920	yeah I just
4588920	4590920	I I mean
4590920	4592920	Shawnee can your patterns
4592920	4594920	go in reverse
4594920	4596920	no they can't they can not
4596920	4598920	they only go in reverse if I do that
4598920	4600920	it'll like should yeah see
4600920	4602920	how it goes in reverse it's because
4602920	4604920	it has to reset to the top
4604920	4606920	of my head in order to do that
4606920	4608920	reverse thing oh we can
4608920	4610920	test that again yeah see how it
4610920	4612920	reverses to the top of my head that's
4612920	4614920	to make sure it works thank you for the 10
4614920	4616920	barrel you know you could ask that for free
4616920	4618920	you guys don't have to
4618920	4620920	ask questions via
4620920	4622920	em
4622920	4624920	money it's not necessary
4624920	4626920	it's really not
4626920	4628920	necessary you don't have to ask questions via
4628920	4630920	money you're more than welcome to ask
4630920	4632920	in chat or on Marshmallow if you want to do it
4632920	4634920	anonymously please don't worry
4634920	4636920	em
4636920	4638920	but yes em I am a very strong
4638920	4640920	believer in
4640920	4642920	em the girls earn the money
4642920	4644920	they get to keep the lines share
4644920	4646920	em
4646920	4648920	because I don't
4648920	4650920	I don't think it's very nice
4650920	4652920	if the girls were only earning
4652920	4654920	like the standard 50-50 rate
4654920	4656920	like what's your motivation to work
4656920	4658920	if every time you make 100 bucks
4658920	4660920	a management take 50
4660920	4662920	for doing a full
4662920	4664920	other than like handing you the model because
4664920	4666920	at this point in time it's kind of like
4666920	4668920	again
4668920	4670920	egan

4674920	4676920	thank you for the the super chat

4684920	4686920	Toggle
4686920	4688920	I just like hearing my name spoken with a Scottish accent
4688920	4690920	you should teach others how to speak like that
4690920	4692920	I think it could be a thing
4692920	4694920	well she'd be starting to develop a
4694920	4696920	not a pretty decent Scottish accent
4696920	4698920	em
4698920	4700920	I don't know how much she used to watch me
4700920	4702920	wink wink
4702920	4704920	em but she certainly gives
4704920	4706920	an impression she's listened to me for a decent
4706920	4708920	amount but when we were playing
4708920	4710920	Gartik phone and
4710920	4712920	and I was like oh when the jobby hits your

5608920	5610920	emm and
5610920	5612920	sorry it must have been a refling mention in the money they gave
5612920	5614920	me in chat I'm sure I read someone saying
5614920	5616920	I gave you that and then what
5616920	5618920	emm we are
5618920	5620920	59 cooking we have a stack of
5620920	5622920	10,000 swordfish which was
5622920	5624920	which was not cheap at all
5624920	5626920	not cheap at all
5626920	5628920	we are currently cooking through that and I am
5628920	5630920	ranting and raving
5630920	5632920	my head off
5632920	5634920	emm just about anything and everything
5634920	5636920	emm
5636920	5638920	but yes I was currently gushing about
5638920	5640920	the girls doing hand cam streams
5640920	5642920	now that sheby's monetised
5642920	5644920	I actually don't know when she's doing her monetisation stream
5644920	5646920	emm
5646920	5648920	hold on let me just
5648920	5650920	let me just ask her when
5650920	5652920	are you doing
5652920	5654920	monetisation stream because I might need to put her monetisation
5654920	5656920	live
5656920	5658920	emm eeps
5658920	5660920	eeps because I've not put her monetisation live
5660920	5662920	emm and before you're like wait
5662920	5664920	you control monetisation
5664920	5666920	no in order for the girls to be less
5666920	5668920	stressed I do the
5668920	5670920	kind of boring stuff which is opening up
5670920	5672920	memberships and setting it
5672920	5674920	the price and adding her emotes to her
5674920	5676920	badges for example
5676920	5678920	emm hey fart head
5678920	5680920	hey shit
5680920	5682920	emm yes
5682920	5684920	so if sheby plans on
5684920	5686920	doing it the day
5686920	5688920	I will have to quickly run away for 5 minutes
5688920	5690920	and quickly set that up because I don't have
5690920	5692920	access to her account
5692920	5694920	on the cp your cash is
5694920	5696920	20 times the cost of that swordfish though
5696920	5698920	I know but I didn't do anything for the cash
5698920	5700920	or the swordfish
5700920	5702920	I just came I just got here
5702920	5704920	emm
5704920	5706920	wow level 60
5706920	5708920	wow
5708920	5710920	that's amazing
5710920	5712920	frickin 60 how many
5712920	5714920	are we burnt or burned
5714920	5716920	percentage is going up
5716920	5718920	cause I know swordfish is a bit harder than what was
5718920	5720920	cooked
5720920	5722920	we are still doing 1000 an hour
5722920	5724920	it is possible
5724920	5726920	I will beat the swordfish
5726920	5728920	stack before
5728920	5730920	emm
5730920	5732920	eh
5732920	5734920	just saying the chat that gave you the
5734920	5736920	JP is 20 times killer than me
5738920	5740920	emm yeah basic management
5740920	5742920	tell me said
5742920	5744920	emmy said she is doing it tomorrow
5744920	5746920	yes emmy and I say I am putting their stuff
5746920	5748920	live probably after
5748920	5750920	the stream
5750920	5752920	because I need it to go up 24 hours
5752920	5754920	cause so youtube says they need to
5754920	5756920	approve the membership tiers
5756920	5758920	but they don't approve nothing
5758920	5760920	they literally
5760920	5762920	can go for it
5762920	5764920	level 99 by the end of the stream trust
5764920	5766920	just doing endurance stream right after closing the
5766920	5768920	endurance stream honestly
5768920	5770920	eh
5770920	5772920	I could never do this I'm just giving it a
5772920	5774920	shot it's always been a childhood dream
5774920	5776920	of kinda like reaching 99
5776920	5778920	in any level as you can
5778920	5780920	see we haven't even touched any of the
5780920	5782920	member skills but
5782920	5784920	or my combat is so low
5784920	5786920	but
5786920	5788920	literally having it up here is really nice
5788920	5790920	emm and I picked
5790920	5792920	cooking because
5792920	5794920	I have incredibly
5794920	5796920	baby memories
5796920	5798920	of me being outside the back of
5798920	5800920	Lumberge castle
5800920	5802920	and I had my
5802920	5804920	pickaxe I had my tinder box
5804920	5806920	I had my little basic
5806920	5808920	bronze sword
5808920	5810920	and I used to
5810920	5812920	kill the big rats outside the
5812920	5814920	back of the castle cook them
5814920	5816920	and I think the highest cooking
5816920	5818920	level I ever got was 40 as a child
5818920	5820920	emm
5820920	5822920	which is just freaking adorable
5822920	5824920	which is why I want
5824920	5826920	cooking 99 first cause I've just
5826920	5828920	enjoyed it literally these gender
5828920	5830920	norms have hands of course the wham
5830920	5832920	and picks cooking oh we're about to get
5832920	5834920	to 9000 the stack
5834920	5836920	is getting weir it's getting
5836920	5838920	smaller getting a wee wee
5838920	5840920	stack burnt swordfish
5840920	5842920	is probably worth more than cooked
5842920	5844920	on the open market these burnt food
5844920	5846920	collectors are pretty oh I'm aware
5846920	5848920	about the burnt food collectors
5848920	5850920	emm and they just give you
5850920	5852920	a price for it which is pretty crazy
5852920	5854920	emm
5854920	5856920	fire making is probably the next
5856920	5858920	fast this is winter tot
5858920	5860920	yes that was a ghost
5860920	5862920	fires in winter tot or am I making
5862920	5864920	that up
5864920	5866920	I might be making that up I'm gonna be
5866920	5868920	going crazy
5868920	5870920	emm
5870920	5872920	my current level is 60
5872920	5874920	on the dot
5874920	5876920	I did title the stream 70 question
5876920	5878920	mark but someone did
5878920	5880920	napkin math and said if I finish
5880920	5882920	cooking all these swordfish
5882920	5884920	I might be 78
5884920	5886920	which is just fantastic
5886920	5888920	truly
5888920	5890920	emm
5890920	5892920	but I thought the cooking thing was a
5892920	5894920	meta meme like mommy knows how to cook
5894920	5896920	there is the proof I mean honestly we could
5896920	5898920	do it that way as well but I kind of did it
5898920	5900920	is like oh these gender norms have hands
5900920	5902920	I just really enjoy cooking like I know
5902920	5904920	there's this in real life
5904920	5906920	runescape chick and she has
5906920	5908920	massive knockers I'm talking
5908920	5910920	a zero level knockers and I used
5910920	5912920	to just sit and watch her cook
5912920	5914920	lobsters and like so many
5914920	5916920	people would come in the chat and say such
5916920	5918920	horrendous things when would be the best
5918920	5920920	food for winter tot so we
5920920	5922920	keep all gimli
5922920	5924920	give it a rest darling I can't
5924920	5926920	have you in the room
5926920	5928920	she's up she's losing it
5928920	5930920	she's losing it
5930920	5932920	I don't know if it's coming up in the microphone
5932920	5934920	or not but she's losing it
5934920	5936920	this is I shouldn't have let her in
5936920	5938920	because now it's going to take a couple of days
5938920	5940920	for her to unlearn that she's allowed in
5940920	5942920	this room gimli
5942920	5944920	I can't hear her okay she's currently behind
5944920	5946920	the door going
5948920	5950920	basically
5950920	5952920	um
5952920	5954920	she should have given up by now
5954920	5956920	it's been
5956920	5958920	it's been quite a while she should have gone
5958920	5960920	to sleep I wouldn't be honest
5960920	5962920	I should have
5962920	5964920	played with her more but I ran out of time
5964920	5966920	because I was making a cup of tea but I did feed her
5966920	5968920	and I threw the mouse
5968920	5970920	a few times to give her a few laps around to
5970920	5972920	her dog she's not a dog
5972920	5974920	she's a cat

6052920	6054920	what you're looking in YouTube right now
6054920	6056920	it's absolutely terrifying
6056920	6058920	um

6078920	6080920	oh
6080920	6082920	oh
6082920	6084920	um but yeah
6084920	6086920	can we see them the next hand cam
6086920	6088920	you saw Gimli's back
6088920	6090920	in the foot
6090920	6092920	in the celebration stream near the end of it
6092920	6094920	you saw Gimli come in the room
6094920	6096920	but I had to take her out because she was gonna knock over the webcam
6096920	6098920	um
6098920	6100920	I do have a picture of them
6100920	6102920	um they killed a rat
6102920	6104920	um
6104920	6106920	so I thought Gimli was the hunter
6106920	6108920	but no
6108920	6110920	Vigo was the hunter
6110920	6112920	he caught a rat in the garden
6112920	6114920	I don't even know
6114920	6116920	it was there and he
6116920	6118920	destroyed it so quickly
6118920	6120920	um
6120920	6122920	I'm pretty sure he like
6122920	6124920	so if he didn't know the way that cats hunt
6124920	6126920	is they apply pressure
6126920	6128920	on the throat of the
6128920	6130920	prey
6130920	6132920	so basically it gets
6132920	6134920	either suffocated or you know
6134920	6136920	damaged out which is a shame to say
6136920	6138920	Vigo
6138920	6140920	I let him out in the garden
6140920	6142920	and within 10 seconds
6142920	6144920	he had perished
6144920	6146920	the rat
6146920	6148920	I didn't, I have a picture of it
6148920	6150920	I'll maybe post it but I know people don't
6150920	6152920	like seeing dead animals so maybe it's not too nice
6152920	6154920	maybe I'll put like
6154920	6156920	a little black bar over the rat's eyes
6156920	6158920	just to protect its identity
6158920	6160920	you know
6160920	6162920	and eat and respect its wee family
6162920	6164920	um
6164920	6166920	damn though, put it in my base
6166920	6168920	cat almost knocks you
6168920	6170920	honestly
6170920	6172920	um
6172920	6174920	wait, cat almost knocks me
6174920	6176920	are you that fucking fanny
6176920	6178920	honestly, if you are, go and just leave me alone
6178920	6180920	um
6180920	6182920	but yeah we
6182920	6184920	uh
6184920	6186920	wee family, wee Vigo
6186920	6188920	mmm
6188920	6190920	is there somewhere we can
6190920	6192920	send cat pics? I mean you can just
6192920	6194920	at me
6194920	6196920	it's fine on twitter
6196920	6198920	uh
6198920	6200920	honestly
6200920	6202920	honestly honestly
6204920	6206920	my cat is being a menace
6206920	6208920	to the local bird population
6208920	6210920	it's illegal to let your
6210920	6212920	cats outside in Australia
6212920	6214920	or I don't know if it's just
6214920	6216920	in Victoria
6216920	6218920	but it's illegal to let them out
6218920	6220920	so I have a
6220920	6222920	caged off
6222920	6224920	which is such a shame
6224920	6226920	but I'd rather they get outside time
6226920	6228920	than no outside time at all because I actually don't think
6228920	6230920	it's natural for cats to be inside
6230920	6232920	um
6232920	6234920	but yeah, they made it illegal
6236920	6238920	um
6238920	6240920	Australia does have a wild cat problem
6240920	6242920	oh my god, it's so sad
6242920	6244920	I wish I didn't learn about it
6244920	6246920	but they basically call wild cats
6246920	6248920	instead of just doing capture and release
6248920	6250920	because it's like so out of control
6250920	6252920	type thing
6252920	6254920	and I'm like
6256920	6258920	although it's kind of like learning about cat island
6258920	6260920	in Japan, there's
6260920	6262920	a tourist state island called cat island
6262920	6264920	but the problem is
6264920	6266920	none of the cats are fled or looked after
6266920	6268920	or new urge so the population is completely
6268920	6270920	out of control
6270920	6272920	oh my god, Gimli
6272920	6274920	she's doing my head and
6276920	6278920	oh my god
6278920	6280920	Gimli
6280920	6282920	I know
6282920	6284920	you guys might not be able to hear her
6284920	6286920	she's going absolutely berserk right now
6286920	6288920	she should have given up like a long time ago
6288920	6290920	and gone back to sleep
6290920	6292920	what have I done? I've created a monster
6292920	6294920	because nobody wants to see Marshal no more
6294920	6296920	he's chop level
6296920	6298920	I don't know the rest of the words
6304920	6306920	oh my god
6306920	6308920	I can't think when she's me on
6308920	6310920	wait hold on
6310920	6312920	right
6312920	6314920	I don't need to do her monetization
6314920	6316920	of the
6318920	6320920	video
6320920	6322920	okay I don't need to worry
6322920	6324920	about sheepsters but
6324920	6326920	I will be putting M.A. and A.C.'s
6326920	6328920	thing live
6328920	6330920	praying that a speller member names right
6330920	6332920	but I'm pretty sure it's
6332920	6334920	Snow Bear
6334920	6336920	Ease
6336920	6338920	and
6338920	6340920	Pin Pals
6340920	6342920	and
6346920	6348920	to be further driving the berserk thing
6348920	6350920	I just think it's very
6350920	6352920	dramatic
6352920	6354920	you've been telling me I've been breaking the law
6354920	6356920	for the past 23 years and didn't know
6356920	6358920	apparently it's going to slow
6358920	6360920	and England just made it
6360920	6362920	that your cat has to get microchipped
6362920	6364920	now
6364920	6366920	and I'm like interesting
6366920	6368920	but what's the real reason behind
6368920	6370920	that because is it just
6370920	6372920	another tax on pet owners
6372920	6374920	oh if you're a pet
6374920	6376920	owner and you need to use litter
6376920	6378920	by the way like a litter box
6378920	6380920	you know how it's really expensive for litter box
6380920	6382920	like pellets
6382920	6384920	and all that
6384920	6386920	play sand
6386920	6388920	cats love to take big massive dookies in play sand
6388920	6390920	which is the cheapest thing ever
6390920	6392920	it lasts so long
6392920	6394920	especially if you can have an outside litter
6394920	6396920	tray for them if they have access to outside
6396920	6398920	you will save
6398920	6400920	literally hundreds upon thousands
6400920	6402920	of dollars over the years
6402920	6404920	it costs
6404920	6406920	eight dollars for a bag of sand
6406920	6408920	and it costs 20
6408920	6410920	for a decent cat grit
6410920	6412920	just give them sand they love it
6412920	6414920	you can scoop it it's super good
6414920	6416920	and it saves your pockets
6416920	6418920	so much money
6418920	6420920	because there's such a tax
6420920	6422920	on pet owners
6422920	6424920	the only thing I haven't figured out yet
6424920	6426920	is how to get good quality food
6426920	6428920	because
6428920	6430920	I was actually thinking of making like
6430920	6432920	homemade cat
6432920	6434920	the fire is gone
6434920	6436920	no
6436920	6438920	rifling what happened
6438920	6440920	wait let me pick up the ashes hold on
6440920	6442920	oh wait I can't I've got too much swordfish
6442920	6444920	wait hold on hold on
6444920	6446920	I'll pick up the ashes and take them out of the way
6446920	6448920	I need to put them out of the way okay
6448920	6450920	now the ashes are out of the way
6450920	6452920	no the embers have went out
6452920	6454920	I've just picked up burnt fish as well by accident
6456920	6458920	slim cuttles
6458920	6460920	or strongy shady
6460920	6462920	excellent cuttle stones bearer
6462920	6464920	em always
6464920	6466920	thought it would be cute to have a big chalky cat
6466920	6468920	oh well thanks for the tip
6468920	6470920	I can't even remember what the tip was
6470920	6472920	thank you for putting the fire back on again replaying
6474920	6476920	it's over
6476920	6478920	they didn't kindle the fire now it's the age of darkness
6478920	6480920	crazy concept
6480920	6482920	go fish
6482920	6484920	the riflings with happily taste test
6484920	6486920	your homemade cat food
6486920	6488920	yeah I've wanted to make homemade
6488920	6490920	thank you for getting me back on the subject
6490920	6492920	cause I completely forgot what I was rambling about
6492920	6494920	em
6494920	6496920	I wanted to make homemade cat food
6496920	6498920	because they were struggling
6498920	6500920	to eat like that pre-made stuff
6500920	6502920	and the thing
6502920	6504920	this sounds really bad
6504920	6506920	but on the
6506920	6508920	boxes of cat food it says not fit
6508920	6510920	for human consumption
6510920	6512920	okay
6512920	6514920	now the reason why that alarms me
6514920	6516920	is because I would never want to give my cat
6516920	6518920	something that I couldn't eat
6518920	6520920	and cats eat meat cats are
6520920	6522920	wow
6522920	6524920	61
6524920	6526920	thank you
6526920	6528920	thank you riflings for funding my cooking habit
6528920	6530920	em
6530920	6532920	eh yeah
6532920	6534920	I just find it a bit
6534920	6536920	hmm and sus
6536920	6538920	that
6538920	6540920	it's not fit for human consumption
6540920	6542920	when the content is just
6542920	6544920	supposed to be meat that's possible
6544920	6546920	for cats to eat
6546920	6548920	which I don't like
6548920	6550920	VV buys a rotisserie chicken
6550920	6552920	my cats didn't like
6552920	6554920	Willy's chicken I fed them it
6554920	6556920	actually you know
6556920	6558920	who liked Willy's chicken more than
6558920	6560920	my freaking cats
6560920	6562920	the magpies which I've yet to name
6562920	6564920	em it's
6564920	6566920	a husband magpie
6566920	6568920	a wife magpie
6568920	6570920	and a daughter magpie
6570920	6572920	that visits me
6572920	6574920	oh no
6574920	6576920	rifling
6576920	6578920	oh no it's the rifling afk
6578920	6580920	that normally does like the big log pile
6580920	6582920	wait I'll clear away the ashes hold on
6582920	6584920	there you go it's out of the way
6584920	6586920	wah
6586920	6588920	I keep clicking collect
6588920	6590920	bank banker take that out
6590920	6592920	then take it out raw

6600920	6602920	praise the sun
6602920	6604920	em
6604920	6606920	pet food in general is a rarity
6606920	6608920	let alone
6608920	6610920	affordability hmm
6610920	6612920	it's like ridiculous pricing as well
6612920	6614920	like I'm not happy with the price as well
6614920	6616920	em but I thought it would be really cute
6616920	6618920	to make like
6618920	6620920	homemade cat food for them
6620920	6622920	it wouldn't be the best but like I've seen
6622920	6624920	this youtube channel
6624920	6626920	I think it's called Joon's Kitchen
6626920	6628920	and it's literally dedicated to feeding
6628920	6630920	the cat's gourmet
6630920	6632920	homemade food and it's the most adorable
6632920	6634920	thing ever and I'm like that's what I want to do
6634920	6636920	for Viko and Gimli
6636920	6638920	em cats are hyper carnivores
6638920	6640920	yes carnivores I almost said

6818920	6820920	oh
6820920	6822920	I'm at 6k I've not even done the first thank you
6822920	6824920	celebration
6824920	6826920	wait hold on let me
6826920	6828920	screenshot this so you guys can see what I see
6828920	6830920	you can see
6830920	6832920	I'm not a
6832920	6834920	I'm not a secret kind of creator
6834920	6836920	I'll show you what I see this is what I see
6836920	6838920	on the video it hasn't updated
6838920	6840920	the
6840920	6842920	where is it
6842920	6844920	it hasn't
6846920	6848920	ah that would be too easy
6848920	6850920	wouldn't that image
6850920	6852920	make source
6852920	6854920	this is just youtube
6854920	6856920	stats video I guess
6856920	6858920	ok
6858920	6860920	and then pick this one on my desktop please
6864920	6866920	is that it this video
6866920	6868920	wow
6868920	6870920	wow on air
6870920	6872920	you see that
6876920	6878920	holy
6878920	6880920	on air
6880920	6882920	that got pushed so much
6882920	6884920	look at browse feature
6884920	6886920	76%
6886920	6888920	browse feature my goodness
6888920	6890920	but look
6890920	6892920	it says I got 300 subscribers for it
6892920	6894920	the money hasn't updated because
6894920	6896920	it takes like 48 hours for the money to show
6896920	6898920	wow I didn't
6898920	6900920	not expect that
6900920	6902920	the fact the watch time
6902920	6904920	is 1.8k hours
6904920	6906920	if you didn't know to get monetized you need
6906920	6908920	3k watch hours
6908920	6910920	holy crap
6910920	6912920	maybe gen 2
6912920	6914920	should come out with an ASMR video before
6914920	6916920	debut but kind of ruins the voice
6916920	6918920	although saying that you hear the voice in the trailer
6918920	6920920	in the shorts anyways that's not much of a deal
6920920	6922920	because it might help with the culling if the girls
6922920	6924920	came out with an ASMR video for gen 2
6924920	6926920	um
6926920	6928920	nice when quality is rewarded
6928920	6930920	but look at that
6930920	6932920	browse feature source
6932920	6934920	that's pretty nice
6934920	6936920	sorry my tongue is rumbling
6936920	6938920	if you heard that
6938920	6940920	um literally
6940920	6942920	I've not even got my first thank you for
6942920	6944920	1k out yet
6944920	6946920	oh
6946920	6948920	oh my god yeah
6948920	6950920	wow I'm 5800
6950920	6952920	I literally tweeted
6952920	6954920	thanks for 5k yesterday holy crap
6954920	6956920	that's insane
6956920	6958920	your trailer
6958920	6960920	hooked me pretty hard
6966920	6968920	well I wasn't lying
6968920	6970920	during debut and I was like you'll be eating good
6970920	6972920	if you're an ASMR enthusiast
6974920	6976920	it's unlikely I'll get that first
6976920	6978920	video out today
6978920	6980920	because I'm doing
6980920	6982920	AC and Emmys membership when I get
6982920	6984920	offline and then probably collapsing
6984920	6986920	unless
6986920	6988920	although I will say it's really fun editing
6988920	6990920	my thank you
6990920	6992920	videos because
6992920	6994920	I'm not making it
6994920	6996920	super professional and like editing out
6996920	6998920	all the bumps I'm just lowering the bumps
6998920	7000920	in that so it's still like on the same level
7000920	7002920	the culling was so
7002920	7004920	silly it was
7004920	7006920	absolutely insane on AC
7006920	7008920	I mentioned this yesterday
7008920	7010920	so don't worry if you didn't hear it
7010920	7012920	but AC got called
7012920	7014920	1500 subscribers
7014920	7016920	and on the same day
7016920	7018920	I got called 700 subscribers
7018920	7020920	even though she had more
7020920	7022920	shorts out like I was pushing shorts
7022920	7024920	on AC
7024920	7026920	at the time
7026920	7028920	that's just crazy
7028920	7030920	do you love a cheeky bit of ASMR
7032920	7034920	it was so rough
7034920	7036920	on AC but she's been doing fantastic
7036920	7038920	honestly
7040920	7042920	I am
7042920	7044920	still interested
7044920	7046920	in a clipper program for the girls
7048920	7050920	I'm just waiting for the first month
7050920	7052920	of income to come in and then I can
7052920	7054920	kind of open up pie charts and be like
7054920	7056920	right is this going to be
7056920	7058920	possible for Vehler to do
7058920	7060920	a clipping program like Idol N has done
7060920	7062920	because I really like it I think it's a really
7062920	7064920	good way to get clippers involved
7064920	7066920	and help promote the girls
7066920	7068920	and all that jazz
7068920	7070920	I think it's fantastic so
7070920	7072920	we are still looking into that
7072920	7074920	and hopefully it will give the girls a cheeky boost
7078920	7080920	I've had to resub three times
7080920	7082920	I had to
7082920	7084920	subscribe back onto the girls at one point as well
7084920	7086920	I was like bruh we were
7086920	7088920	literally all each other's first subscribers
7088920	7090920	and I got booted off and I'm like great
7090920	7092920	you've stolen it from me
7092920	7094920	absolutely stolen it
7096920	7098920	I hope those missing
7098920	7100920	1500 OG suns
7100920	7102920	find their way to her
7102920	7104920	honestly though
7104920	7106920	I'm sure they will I'm sure they'll be like hey
7106920	7108920	wasn't there a cute polar bear around here at one point
7108920	7110920	if
7110920	7112920	you interact with the content
7112920	7114920	like leave a like on stream or leave a comment
7114920	7116920	then the algorithm
7116920	7118920	will show the girl more to you
7118920	7120920	so if you are
7120920	7122920	an OG sun you're like
7122920	7124920	her streams are never showing up please do consider
7124920	7126920	like just going on her
7126920	7128920	short feed for example
7128920	7130920	wait don't like this stuff
7130920	7132920	right away like genuinely sit and watch it
7132920	7134920	because if you don't sit and watch it
7134920	7136920	then the algorithm knows that you
7136920	7138920	are just sitting there
7138920	7140920	it's really annoying but the algorithm
7140920	7142920	is now too advanced
7142920	7144920	because
7144920	7146920	before way back and much older
7146920	7148920	YouTube days if you left the like
7148920	7150920	you left the like
7150920	7152920	but now the algorithm is like
7152920	7154920	this person left the like at the 2 minute mark
7154920	7156920	maybe something interesting
7156920	7158920	happened 2 minutes in
7158920	7160920	okay because of that statistic we're gonna now
7160920	7162920	promote this video
7162920	7164920	to people who
7164920	7166920	have interacted with this
7166920	7168920	VTuber because they're related or something
7168920	7170920	like the algorithm just gets so
7170920	7172920	silly
7172920	7174920	I'm dying for the Hypno Viz
7174920	7176920	the Hypno Viz can actually
7176920	7178920	go on YouTube. YouTube allows Hypnosis
7178920	7180920	Patreon doesn't
7180920	7182920	make it make sense
7182920	7184920	but we love YouTube out here for that reason
7186920	7188920	it's very strange
7188920	7190920	very very strange
7190920	7192920	probably the first hit
7192920	7194920	sorry here take this burnt
7194920	7196920	burnt swordfish
7196920	7198920	the first ASMR
7198920	7200920	I'm gonna do is forget your name
7200920	7202920	and replace it with Reefling
7202920	7204920	um
7204920	7206920	I will not
7206920	7208920	make it a permanent effect
7208920	7210920	I will make it
7210920	7212920	a session I think maybe a 30 minute
7212920	7214920	session if you will
7214920	7216920	um
7216920	7218920	and I'll give maybe give it
7218920	7220920	like 2 hour effect I really
7220920	7222920	do not want to do mess around with permanent
7222920	7224920	effects too much it kind of scares me
7224920	7226920	permanent effect stuff I have to be honest
7226920	7228920	I'm a bit of a scaredy cat
7228920	7230920	ooh our burn percentage is up to
7230920	7232920	15
7232920	7234920	I think it's holding steady at 15 though
7234920	7236920	and hopefully
7236920	7238920	lower as we get more
7238920	7240920	leveled up
7240920	7242920	um wait no Hypnosis
7242920	7244920	no Hypnosis is
7244920	7246920	ban it is a
7246920	7248920	bannable um
7248920	7250920	offense suspendable
7250920	7252920	if you will um
7252920	7254920	there was a ASMR
7254920	7256920	artist actually that got their entire
7256920	7258920	Patreon taken down not even
7258920	7260920	a chance to
7260920	7262920	um appeal
7262920	7264920	or uh get suspended
7264920	7266920	and then delete the content sometimes
7266920	7268920	Patreon will suspend your account
7268920	7270920	until you
7270920	7272920	your content applies to their
7272920	7274920	TOS so if it's not too offensive
7274920	7276920	whatever you've done or made
7276920	7278920	um but there wasn't ASMR
7278920	7280920	recently who got their entire thing just
7280920	7282920	taken down which was pretty
7282920	7284920	crazy just making me
7284920	7286920	permanently less procrastinate
7286920	7288920	yeah honestly only
7288920	7290920	a bit of mind break I feel
7290920	7292920	you yeah
7292920	7294920	chubby uh weight gain
7294920	7296920	that got taken away
7296920	7298920	um which was
7298920	7300920	crazy absolutely crazy
7300920	7302920	I'm not sure
7302920	7304920	I mean I
7304920	7306920	I can
7306920	7308920	see why
7308920	7310920	because sometimes the stuff is like tie down
7310920	7312920	to a chair and funnel fed or whatever but
7312920	7314920	it just gets
7314920	7316920	ridiculous because whoever's participating
7316920	7318920	or creating especially for when it comes
7318920	7320920	to audio side of stuff like no visuals
7320920	7322920	no nothing like
7322920	7324920	it gets pretty ridiculous like
7324920	7326920	that you can't do it like
7326920	7328920	but anyway uh all healer
7328920	7330920	mastercard overlords
7330920	7332920	yes yes yes yes yes you win
7332920	7334920	yeah again you win you win again
7334920	7336920	hey ho you win again
7336920	7338920	um
7340920	7342920	who's thinking up all these rules and
7342920	7344920	restrictions are overlords
7344920	7346920	don't you not know about them
7346920	7348920	see there's this company called black rock
7348920	7350920	and then there's a second company called
7350920	7352920	I've forgotten the name of the second company
7352920	7354920	and they own everything um
7354920	7356920	and uh
7356920	7358920	oh wait until you learn about politics
7358920	7360920	oh my goodness can't wait to get started
7360920	7362920	about the political
7362920	7364920	side of thing and no I'm not getting into politics
7364920	7366920	but I'll get into destroying the
7366920	7368920	economy and we should restart
7368920	7370920	society or run away to
7370920	7372920	a farm together I'm more
7372920	7374920	opting for the farm side of things
7374920	7376920	um
7376920	7378920	because yeah I think the farm
7378920	7380920	would be a heck of a lot better option
7380920	7382920	um
7384920	7386920	CNC is not okay
7386920	7388920	with Patreon which happens yes
7388920	7390920	we are 62
7392920	7394920	thank you 62 it's
7394920	7396920	nice to see you 62
7396920	7398920	um
7398920	7400920	but yes um
7400920	7402920	so people from an outside
7402920	7404920	perspective think
7404920	7406920	hypnosis um
7406920	7408920	you don't do anything you
7408920	7410920	don't want to do when it comes to hypnosis
7410920	7412920	I am a full believer in that
7412920	7414920	I absolutely do not think
7414920	7416920	but because of the way it seemed
7416920	7418920	comedically in the public eye like
7418920	7420920	for example when a magician
7420920	7422920	does hypnosis oh look
7422920	7424920	they made this person drink a bottle
7424920	7426920	of vinegar type thing
7426920	7428920	um because it's seen that way
7428920	7430920	publicly when the reality is
7430920	7432920	when you participate in
7432920	7434920	an alternative context
7434920	7436920	you do not do anything you don't want to do
7436920	7438920	this is a fact it's just
7438920	7440920	how it works you
7440920	7442920	like people seem to think
7442920	7444920	like you completely just like oh
7444920	7446920	you're inhibitions you can't control
7446920	7448920	anything you're so and it's like no
7448920	7450920	mother that's not
7450920	7452920	how it is
7452920	7454920	all reeflings
7454920	7456920	all together and put a money in
7456920	7458920	oh should we buy a castle
7458920	7460920	should we
7460920	7462920	where should we what country
7462920	7464920	though I want to see a castle
7464920	7466920	in Scotland but um it's very hard
7466920	7468920	to although saying that if we
7468920	7470920	had a green a glass house
7470920	7472920	a greenhouse then we
7472920	7474920	could have tons of um
7474920	7476920	produce maybe
7476920	7478920	we should get a castle in Scotland
7478920	7480920	and then we can have
7480920	7482920	a big garden and we have like we feast
7482920	7484920	on the meals every night and we
7484920	7486920	can try and make me for the first
7486920	7488920	time
7488920	7490920	uh black rock van
7490920	7492920	garden
7492920	7494920	those are the names
7494920	7496920	quick tooth and
7496920	7498920	squiddle kingdom anyway if I can't get
7498920	7500920	banned because I've started talking about black rock
7500920	7502920	it's been a good run been a good run yeah make sure
7502920	7504920	you support the girls uh
7504920	7506920	all hail our overlords um
7506920	7508920	yes
7508920	7510920	um we can try and

7610920	7612920	honey tea although I
7612920	7614920	should actually write an audio like
7614920	7616920	that holy crap why have I not done
7616920	7618920	that yet I'll do it this month
7618920	7620920	because there's a myth in there oh I just
7620920	7622920	really started really hard I said myth
7622920	7624920	if you hate that oh my god
7624920	7626920	there's a missing audio this month I'll
7626920	7628920	make that plot the audio this month
7628920	7630920	please can I make that the plot for
7630920	7632920	Patreon this month where I need
7632920	7634920	my special honey tea
7634920	7636920	oh my god yes
7636920	7638920	um in
7638920	7640920	February I know February
7640920	7642920	so far away but I actually have a meta
7642920	7644920	audio roleplay month
7644920	7646920	as well but yeah I'll
7646920	7648920	make it my missing thing
7648920	7650920	uh
7650920	7652920	I do want to care for
7652920	7654920	a little garden yes
7654920	7656920	so um there's a lot of hardy
7656920	7658920	plants so hardy plants are
7658920	7660920	considered plants that can tolerate
7660920	7662920	close to frost or very
7662920	7664920	low temperatures
7664920	7666920	um these hardy plants
7666920	7668920	are things such as potatoes
7668920	7670920	leaks these root vegetable
7670920	7672920	type things um
7672920	7674920	what's another root vegetable turnip
7674920	7676920	very big um neeps and
7676920	7678920	varieties um
7678920	7680920	is turnips and potatoes
7680920	7682920	these are very successful
7682920	7684920	hardy plants in Scotland
7684920	7686920	so these are probably what we'll focus on
7686920	7688920	and make up the main majority
7688920	7690920	um berries, strawberries
7690920	7692920	um and
7692920	7694920	blackberries for example
7694920	7696920	these berries are actually quite
7696920	7698920	successful in Scotland
7698920	7700920	against all odds
7700920	7702920	um because
7702920	7704920	they're quite resistant um
7704920	7706920	is really quite fascinating
7706920	7708920	um there's a lot of strawberry
7708920	7710920	production and manufacturers in
7710920	7712920	Scotland if you didn't know that
7712920	7714920	a little fun factoid
7714920	7716920	um
7716920	7718920	potatoes, boil and mash them
7718920	7720920	stick them in a stew and we make
7720920	7722920	a big dinner and we have nice
7722920	7724920	yummy dinners every night
7724920	7726920	um a carrots
7726920	7728920	yes carrots a fantastic example
7728920	7730920	a ground vegetable yes yes yes
7730920	7732920	um
7732920	7734920	wow
7734920	7736920	9.4
7736920	7738920	we're about to hit 9.3
7738920	7740920	we're about to hit 8 we're getting so close
7740920	7742920	we're getting so close
7742920	7744920	uh gollum would be fuming right now
7744920	7746920	so the leaks are a winter crop yes
7746920	7748920	um
7748920	7750920	and we can also have like garlic
7750920	7752920	and I can teach you about the drying
7752920	7754920	process of garlic as well
7754920	7756920	um but we would need a shed for that
7756920	7758920	surely one of us
7758920	7760920	we flings are like DIY
7760920	7762920	and can make a shed although
7762920	7764920	oh my god we're like getting two steps away
7764920	7766920	from being Amish at this rate
7766920	7768920	I've not even been funny because
7768920	7770920	like the Amish are known for like building
7770920	7772920	stuff really fast um
7772920	7774920	but like I'm sure
7774920	7776920	if all of us rooflings came together
7776920	7778920	on the castle farm we could build
7778920	7780920	a shed and then I can teach you all
7780920	7782920	about garlic uh
7782920	7784920	curing you need to dry out the
7784920	7786920	garlic because if it's wet it
7786920	7788920	will rot but if you dry it out
7788920	7790920	successfully the garlic will last
7790920	7792920	an entire year from
7792920	7794920	harvest season to the next
7794920	7796920	it will last an entire year it's absolutely
7796920	7798920	fantastic and we need to get massive
7798920	7800920	freezers to freeze all our produce
7800920	7802920	so we can do massive meal preparation
7802920	7804920	as well how big of a shed are we talking
7804920	7806920	it would need to be decent
7806920	7808920	um
7808920	7810920	I'm too scared to learn about canning
7810920	7812920	food because I've heard about
7812920	7814920	it literally perishes people if you mess up
7814920	7816920	the canning process however
7816920	7818920	there's one process I really
7818920	7820920	like and it's
7820920	7822920	dehydrating
7822920	7824920	food so you're left
7824920	7826920	with the dry
7826920	7828920	husk of the food basically
7828920	7830920	but I trust that and
7830920	7832920	apparently that stuff lasts
7832920	7834920	20 freaking years if you
7834920	7836920	put it away right
7836920	7838920	dehydrating food lasts 20 years and I'm like
7838920	7840920	oh my god
7840920	7842920	um
7842920	7844920	I'm like absolutely right this is
7844920	7846920	just me being a weirdo I absolutely
7846920	7848920	love the idea of like a zombie
7848920	7850920	apocalypse now don't get me wrong
7850920	7852920	I will perish within the first few days
7852920	7854920	I will be bitten I'm sorry I'll just
7854920	7856920	admit it there's no way I'm not that good
7856920	7858920	I'm not that guy trust me I'm not
7858920	7860920	that guy um
7860920	7862920	but I really like the idea of like
7862920	7864920	having food reserves and like
7864920	7866920	um I think they're called
7866920	7868920	a bug out bag yes
7868920	7870920	a bug out bag
7870920	7872920	um I
7872920	7874920	freaking love the idea of a bug out bag
7874920	7876920	and like all this like food that's like
7876920	7878920	good to go is it MRE kits
7878920	7880920	I wouldn't mind trying an
7880920	7882920	MRE kit taste testing stream
7882920	7884920	that would be funny like a hand cam
7884920	7886920	MRE thing um
7886920	7888920	that would be curious
7888920	7890920	and then we can judge it from different places
7890920	7892920	because apparently South Korea
7892920	7894920	has the yummiest MRE kits
7894920	7896920	uh America has neutral
7896920	7898920	I think UK is neutral
7898920	7900920	maybe France might have something better
7900920	7902920	MRE
7902920	7904920	clogs your intestines
7904920	7906920	oh no does it
7906920	7908920	I don't know
7908920	7910920	oh like space food just add water yeah
7910920	7912920	like space food we can try space food
7912920	7914920	as well when we try the MRE kits
7914920	7916920	rating MRE kits live cam
7916920	7918920	I just rate it and then like
7918920	7920920	say like a bunch of like stereotypical stuff
7920920	7922920	about the nation that I'm rating
7922920	7924920	um
7924920	7926920	my life wouldn't change if a zombie apocalypse
7926920	7928920	happens just close
7928920	7930920	in the house to it for seven
7930920	7932920	yeah I really like the idea of
7932920	7934920	dehydration food because
7934920	7936920	it lasts years which is
7936920	7938920	just a mind boggling thing
7938920	7940920	to me like I absolutely love the concept
7940920	7942920	of it um
7942920	7944920	I just
7944920	7946920	find it so fascinating that we could
7946920	7948920	preserve foods like if you think
7948920	7950920	of our ancestors who had to live
7950920	7952920	on a yearly crop basis
7952920	7954920	and like if your crops were
7954920	7956920	messed up you were in trouble you had
7956920	7958920	to find a trade quick like if
7958920	7960920	you were a lumberjack and you cut wood
7960920	7962920	or you sold
7962920	7964920	I don't know you sold yourself
7964920	7966920	but that trade really didn't
7966920	7968920	uh still doing it today baby
7968920	7970920	keeping
7970920	7972920	my ancestors proud
7972920	7974920	um if they're lumber
7974920	7976920	um probably fire could chop
7976920	7978920	in probably root harvesting
7978920	7980920	like harvesting mushrooms from a forest
7980920	7982920	like if you knew what ones didn't hurt you
7982920	7984920	um it's like
7984920	7986920	4800 calories shoved into
7986920	7988920	a box I wouldn't be surprised
7988920	7990920	wait really maybe I should eat our MREs
7990920	7992920	cause
7992920	7994920	I don't eat properly recently
7994920	7996920	I've been really strong I don't
7996920	7998920	no ehh ehh ehh ehh ehh ehh
7998920	8000920	reflin reflin reflin
8000920	8002920	do not tape
8002920	8004920	doom
8004920	8006920	do not tape doom
8006920	8008920	I will talk to you openly
8008920	8010920	and honestly I've been struggling
8010920	8012920	to eat a little bit until
8012920	8014920	things settle down
8014920	8016920	I'm very happy to
8016920	8018920	say my A-bomb has calmed down
8018920	8020920	it has calmed down
8020920	8022920	it was preventing me
8022920	8024920	from eating properly
8024920	8026920	basically
8026920	8028920	I could start eating but then I got
8028920	8030920	adrenaline burst which stops
8030920	8032920	me from eating cause I'm not hungry when I get
8032920	8034920	an adrenaline burst
8034920	8036920	but I'm very thankful to say it's subsiding
8036920	8038920	I've managed to eat a bit better
8038920	8040920	recently
8040920	8042920	but no doom
8042920	8044920	no doom
8044920	8046920	ok
8046920	8048920	9.2
8048920	8050920	oh we are doing it we're doing it
8050920	8052920	the stack is going to be gone by the end of the stream
8052920	8054920	mark my words
8054920	8056920	you keep activating our worry mode which is why
8056920	8058920	like I
8058920	8060920	what level are you now I'm level
8060920	8062920	62
8062920	8064920	62 which is fantastic
8064920	8066920	no doom here we're only winning
8066920	8068920	glad to hear you're eating but yes
8068920	8070920	so I because now the girls
8070920	8072920	are getting monetized I feel
8072920	8074920	a lot of relief
8074920	8076920	a lot of like
8076920	8078920	all of it off my shoulders cause
8078920	8080920	I was worried that the designs
8080920	8082920	that I had given Shibi and Azura
8082920	8084920	are going to prevent them from earning
8084920	8086920	money for a month but it's not
8086920	8088920	happening I'm so happy to say
8088920	8090920	it's not happening cause Shibi got monetized
8090920	8092920	which is absolutely fan
8092920	8094920	fantadelastic truly
8094920	8096920	fantastic
8096920	8098920	I am very happy about that
8098920	8100920	please take care of yourself
8100920	8102920	yes I am doing thanks
8102920	8104920	still feels like doom stop it
8104920	8106920	reflying stop it no doom
8106920	8108920	it was because
8108920	8110920	I was so worried about monetization
8110920	8112920	because
8112920	8114920	the girls
8114920	8116920	I've kind of said it
8116920	8118920	a lot of them are wanting to
8118920	8120920	move out
8120920	8122920	and I think it's actually very
8122920	8124920	possible
8124920	8126920	for the first month but we needed
8126920	8128920	youtube monetization just to really
8128920	8130920	elevate it
8130920	8132920	and the thing with youtube monetization
8132920	8134920	as well is that the vods can be
8134920	8136920	the vods
8136920	8138920	the streams like if someone
8138920	8140920	watches back the stream
8140920	8142920	well the girls get like some of the money
8142920	8144920	from the ads as well so it's like generated
8144920	8146920	free income you do not have to actually
8146920	8148920	physically you know
8148920	8150920	hand over money to the girls
8150920	8152920	because you generate money
8152920	8154920	for free watching their asmr's
8154920	8156920	their asmr's are going to go up shortly
8156920	8158920	and I forgot to do mercedes
8158920	8160920	I'll need to give mercedes hers that's what I'm doing
8160920	8162920	I'll put emmy and ac's membership live
8162920	8164920	and I'll put mercedes meme video
8164920	8166920	unlisted so she can upload it whenever she
8166920	8168920	desires
8168920	8170920	and I'm gonna doom no no no
8170920	8172920	no don't doom
8176920	8178920	I have about a tiny speck of doom
8178920	8180920	why would you doom everything is going so well
8180920	8182920	the girls are getting monetized
8182920	8184920	emmy and ac are about to do their celebration
8184920	8186920	mercedes celebration was
8186920	8188920	fantastic
8188920	8190920	someone was gifting her 50 bombs
8190920	8192920	which was insane
8192920	8194920	no dooming on main literally
8194920	8196920	no dooming on main
8196920	8198920	everything is just gone
8198920	8200920	so fantastic
8200920	8202920	I tweeted out like thank you for 5k
8202920	8204920	and I was saying like all that self-doubt
8204920	8206920	and everything is just melting away
8206920	8208920	which is true it has
8208920	8210920	generate money for free
8210920	8212920	yes oh my god
8212920	8214920	please don't ever feel bad if you
8214920	8216920	can't genuinely give money
8216920	8218920	you don't understand
8218920	8220920	you interacting with posts
8220920	8222920	you're promoting them more in the algorithm
8222920	8224920	you're watching their asmr
8224920	8226920	if you watch an ad
8226920	8228920	the girl gets money
8228920	8230920	for that
8230920	8232920	it is just
8232920	8234920	please don't ever worry if you can't handle
8234920	8236920	money
8236920	8238920	I always say like oh I'm always streaming
8238920	8240920	for free you don't have to be a member
8240920	8242920	the membership streams start up next week
8242920	8244920	but you don't have to be a member
8244920	8246920	to consume at all
8246920	8248920	type thingy
8248920	8250920	scrawny I care about you and the girls too much
8250920	8252920	I'm always gonna worry
8252920	8254920	no you're sounding like me
8254920	8256920	I was worrying over them
8256920	8258920	I was like full mummy mode
8258920	8260920	thankfully I got an 8 hour sleep
8260920	8262920	last night
8262920	8264920	oh my god
8264920	8266920	why I probably sound
8266920	8268920	a bit tired
8268920	8270920	I woke up at the last possible minute
8270920	8272920	for stream not because I don't
8272920	8274920	love you because you guys always go
8274920	8276920	mummy's late she doesn't love us anymore
8276920	8278920	no I
8278920	8280920	took medicine to put my ass to sleep
8280920	8282920	and I got a full
8282920	8284920	8 hours and I'm so freaking glad
8284920	8286920	I got a full 8 hours I'm like
8286920	8288920	oh I feel so good
8288920	8290920	it feels so good to get a full 8 hours
8290920	8292920	to sleep
8292920	8294920	but yeah
8294920	8296920	mummy loves us
8296920	8298920	is the mercy meme video
8298920	8300920	be a problem did youtube unlist it
8300920	8302920	no it's not out yet
8302920	8304920	I need to upload it to her channel because
8304920	8306920	I subtitled all the meme videos
8308920	8310920	63
8310920	8312920	63
8312920	8314920	63
8314920	8316920	edgeville bank
8316920	8318920	that was to the theme of 64 zoo lane
8318920	8320920	which is a british TV show
8320920	8322920	or was I don't know if they make new
8322920	8324920	episodes but yeah
8324920	8326920	so if we
8326920	8328920	like commenting streams
8328920	8330920	that helps yeah it helps like
8330920	8332920	immensely like so
8332920	8334920	to give you an example
8334920	8336920	ic does an
8336920	8338920	ASMR stream
8338920	8340920	you like that stream
8340920	8342920	and then emmy does an ASMR stream
8342920	8344920	you like that stream
8344920	8346920	youtube algorithm goes
8346920	8348920	hmm there's a connection between
8348920	8350920	these two girls they've both done
8350920	8352920	ASMR and this viewer both enjoyed
8352920	8354920	them to leave a like
8354920	8356920	and then the algorithm goes
8356920	8358920	hmm this
8358920	8360920	other youtube user
8360920	8362920	both enjoyed these two girls
8362920	8364920	I'm going to start recommending this
8364920	8366920	user these girls
8366920	8368920	em and then it's kind
8368920	8370920	of a knock on effect so
8370920	8372920	em
8372920	8374920	youtube will recommend
8374920	8376920	someone who's never consumed
8376920	8378920	ic's ASMR before
8378920	8380920	because they liked emmy's
8380920	8382920	ASMR and then
8382920	8384920	that also goes further ahead to
8384920	8386920	other vtuber ASMRist for example
8386920	8388920	the algorithm is like
8388920	8390920	an insane tangled
8390920	8392920	spider web of a mess
8392920	8394920	em
8394920	8396920	and anything you do will
8396920	8398920	affect it so for
8398920	8400920	example
8400920	8402920	if you go on twitter right now
8402920	8404920	and you type in emmy bezu
8404920	8406920	and it'll pop up her twitter
8406920	8408920	you've just affected your algorithm on youtube
8408920	8410920	because unfortunately
8410920	8412920	em websites completely
8412920	8414920	cross platform everything whatever
8414920	8416920	you type in even if you go to
8416920	8418920	rule 34 and type in
8418920	8420920	the girls name you are
8420920	8422920	you will affect the results
8422920	8424920	of your youtube browsing experience
8424920	8426920	because of what you've typed
8426920	8428920	in on other websites as well
8428920	8430920	em
8430920	8432920	it goes
8432920	8434920	very deep but unfortunately
8434920	8436920	your websites are all interconnected
8436920	8438920	whether or not you want to
8438920	8440920	whether or not you say like no to
8440920	8442920	cookies no to this they are connected
8442920	8444920	it's undeniable em
8444920	8446920	does youtube listen
8446920	8448920	in the chat too so youtube
8448920	8450920	will see
8450920	8452920	you interacting with me on chat and it'll
8452920	8454920	say this user like
8454920	8456920	strony well em funny
8456920	8458920	enough this other vtuber
8458920	8460920	is like strony i will recommend
8460920	8462920	this person strony
8462920	8464920	another version of strony type
8464920	8466920	thing em sorry i'm not very good
8466920	8468920	with my words at the moment em
8468920	8470920	we'll probably
8470920	8472920	we'll do a tinkle and a refuel
8472920	8474920	at the 3 hour mark em
8474920	8476920	i'm definitely going to make another tea
8476920	8478920	and i'm going to get some yummy yummy snacks
8478920	8480920	em
8480920	8482920	i bought
8482920	8484920	a nature valley bar and i'm like
8484920	8486920	is that the worst snack to eat on stream
8486920	8488920	there's just going to be dust everywhere
8488920	8490920	are you stop looking at me misspelling
8490920	8492920	your name how can you not
8492920	8494920	strony kettles
8494920	8496920	strony
8496920	8498920	kettles
8498920	8500920	strony kettles
8500920	8502920	how can you spell it wrong
8502920	8504920	but yeah like literally
8504920	8506920	if you go on twitter
8506920	8508920	and you search
8508920	8510920	vealour
8510920	8512920	again you're manipulating the algorithm
8512920	8514920	when you go on youtube
8514920	8516920	you'll probably have a few more vealour streams
8516920	8518920	recommended to you on your page
8518920	8520920	or down the sidebar
8520920	8522920	because the algorithm knows
8522920	8524920	that you have an interest in vealour
8524920	8526920	it goes so deep
8526920	8528920	unfortunately cookies are just
8528920	8530920	websites are such liars being like
8530920	8532920	we don't track you via cookies
8532920	8534920	only the essential ones you
8534920	8536920	liar you liar it's just
8536920	8538920	the way the internet is these days
8538920	8540920	we're just such shame but
8540920	8542920	em
8542920	8544920	for the last week
8544920	8546920	i've been getting ads regarding the scotland
8546920	8548920	honestly
8548920	8550920	come visit scotland
8550920	8552920	this scotland tourism industry
8552920	8554920	come to edum
8554920	8556920	actually i think edum
8556920	8558920	is the most expensive than glasgo
8558920	8560920	although it's probably
8560920	8562920	it's such a small amount
8562920	8564920	of difference
8564920	8566920	so if we're watching like scottish youtubers
8566920	8568920	we should get more scottish youtubers
8568920	8570920	em
8570920	8572920	i actually don't know about getting
8572920	8574920	really super rare
8574920	8576920	imma just say this on behalf of all
8576920	8578920	scottish vtubers right now
8578920	8580920	a lot has to go wrong in your life
8580920	8582920	in order to become a scottish
8582920	8584920	vtuber
8584920	8586920	now to become a vtuber in general
8586920	8588920	that's perfectly normal if you're any other nationality
8588920	8590920	if you're scottish
8590920	8592920	and a vtuber
8592920	8594920	bruh whatever happened in your life
8594920	8596920	i feel for you hen so if you're a scottish vtuber
8596920	8598920	listening in i feel for you hen
8598920	8600920	don't worry i went through it too
8600920	8602920	ha ha
8602920	8604920	you know
8604920	8606920	i am only
8606920	8608920	aware of two other scottish
8608920	8610920	vtubers unfortunately
8610920	8612920	they are not for me
8612920	8614920	content wise
8614920	8616920	definitely not for me but that's just
8616920	8618920	my yeah that's just me being me
8618920	8620920	em
8620920	8622920	definitely not on the same page
8622920	8624920	when it comes to
8624920	8626920	thought process
8626920	8628920	or like how we were raised
8628920	8630920	and all that
8630920	8632920	you can kinda tell when you hear someone talk
8632920	8634920	you can kinda tell
8634920	8636920	the way they've been raised in scotland
8636920	8638920	which sounds terrible
8638920	8640920	sounds almost classic but i'm not trying to be like that
8640920	8642920	i'm just trying to be like
8642920	8644920	i don't know
8644920	8646920	you can
8646920	8648920	tell when someone doesn't gear
8648920	8650920	and then you can tell when someone geyser
8650920	8652920	and i'm much better with
8652920	8654920	people who don't need geyser
8654920	8656920	you know
8656920	8658920	if i infect other people's algorithm
8658920	8660920	em
8660920	8662920	i suppose the only way
8662920	8664920	you can do it
8664920	8666920	oh we're almost at 8k
8666920	8668920	is
8668920	8670920	by posting
8670920	8672920	youtube shorts in particular
8672920	8674920	in locations where it's appropriate
8674920	8676920	so just say you're in a general vtuber fan discord
8676920	8678920	if someone were to
8678920	8680920	watch that short fully
8680920	8682920	you have successfully infected them
8682920	8684920	algorithm wise
8684920	8686920	em
8686920	8688920	because they consumed
8688920	8690920	that content it's fascinating
8690920	8692920	honestly i actually am quite
8692920	8694920	interested in the infection
8694920	8696920	side of it but yes
8696920	8698920	you can successfully infect someone
8698920	8700920	the vealor virus
8700920	8702920	em
8702920	8704920	em
8706920	8708920	em so i just
8708920	8710920	wrote that comment
8710920	8712920	yes you can affect someone by doing that
8712920	8714920	if they have never consumed vealor content
8714920	8716920	em
8716920	8718920	but you maybe make clips
8718920	8720920	of the girls and they click it for the first time
8720920	8722920	because they got recommended or you post
8722920	8724920	in a discord that's appropriate to post
8724920	8726920	the vtuber stuff or maybe
8726920	8728920	a vtuber reddit
8728920	8730920	actually there i think there's
8730920	8732920	so
8732920	8734920	vealor do have the vealor reddit
8734920	8736920	but it's not being publicly posted yet
8736920	8738920	but i sh
8738920	8740920	i don't know i mean literally i was just gonna
8740920	8742920	do everyone's oh sorry
8742920	8744920	this is why i can't talk and think at the same time
8744920	8746920	em
8746920	8748920	there is a possibility of just posting it for memes
8748920	8750920	but we were gonna have to put it on approved
8750920	8752920	posts only
8752920	8754920	because it can get nasty pretty quickly
8754920	8756920	em
8756920	8758920	and i do not want any of the girls to be
8758920	8760920	subjected to anything
8760920	8762920	nasty
8762920	8764920	let's go infect some replaying
8764920	8766920	i have no idea what you're saying
8766920	8768920	but i'll take your word for it thank you
8768920	8770920	is edinburgh a bad place no it's not
8770920	8772920	it's just more
8772920	8774920	rich
8774920	8776920	and sometimes rich people
8776920	8778920	are not very empathetic
8778920	8780920	em but that was such
8780920	8782920	a mean and nasty generalization
8782920	8784920	when i say rich people i'm talking like
8784920	8786920	multi-billionaires
8786920	8788920	multi-billionaires type stuff rich
8788920	8790920	em the average do everyone's
8790920	8792920	empathetic to one another each other
8792920	8794920	but if you're not very empathetic please don't worry
8794920	8796920	i'm actually gonna do an educational stream
8796920	8798920	on human nature and empathy
8798920	8800920	empathy is a practice behaviour
8800920	8802920	you need to practice empathy to get it
8802920	8804920	you need to
8804920	8806920	flip the switch and be able to
8806920	8808920	have abstract thoughts about empathy
8808920	8810920	as a whole
8810920	8812920	and i'm actually going to challenge you guys
8812920	8814920	and i'm going to make up scenarios
8814920	8816920	where you need to be empathetic
8816920	8818920	and you need to give me a reason why you feel empathetic
8818920	8820920	but i'm going to make the scenario
8820920	8822920	super hard so at a glance
8822920	8824920	you're like that's disgusting behaviour
8824920	8826920	that's
8826920	8828920	but
8828920	8830920	but we have to learn
8830920	8832920	to be empathetic and we have to think
8832920	8834920	about why the person
8834920	8836920	may have behaved that way
8836920	8838920	it'll be an interesting
8838920	8840920	concept either the stream will go terrible
8840920	8842920	and everyone can laugh at it which is fine
8842920	8844920	i don't mind you guys are allowed to laugh at my
8844920	8846920	stream ideas because i have a pretty bizarre
8846920	8848920	concept sometimes
8848920	8850920	oh man we have a place like that too
8850920	8852920	in Milan never got Milan
8852920	8854920	so it's like London but smaller and prettier
8854920	8856920	yeah it's pretty old
8856920	8858920	there's a lot of older architecture
8858920	8860920	Edinburgh is turning people
8860920	8862920	into an English city in regards to the most posh people
8862920	8864920	i definitely
8864920	8866920	feel more comfortable in Glasgow
8866920	8868920	and good old Glasgow
8868920	8870920	mutual comfy
8870920	8872920	disgusting and
8872920	8874920	i'm going to pull the lever
8874920	8876920	and make everything worse
8876920	8878920	what does that mean
8878920	8880920	the Scottish accents kind of come from
8880920	8882920	yeah so
8882920	8884920	the more slang you speak
8884920	8886920	statistically the more povo you are
8886920	8888920	and it's completely normal
8888920	8890920	to be in poverty in Scotland
8890920	8892920	the statistics
8892920	8894920	are 1 in 5 children
8894920	8896920	are growing up in poverty
8896920	8898920	however i actually think the statistics
8898920	8900920	is probably going to be 1 in 3 now
8900920	8902920	so it's
8902920	8904920	completely normal to be
8904920	8906920	impoverished when you grow up
8906920	8908920	it's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary
8908920	8910920	anyone's rich type ideal
8910920	8912920	i like that
8912920	8914920	i like human psychology
8914920	8916920	that sounds pretty interesting
8916920	8918920	are you trying to get us to empathize with some scoundrels
8918920	8920920	no nothing bad
8920920	8922920	but i want to

8974920	8976920	i heard a lot of good stuff about glassy
8976920	8978920	yes firepog
8978920	8980920	flames yes
8980920	8982920	um

8984920	8986920	wait sorry isn't current british english
8986920	8988920	only a thing because they didn't want to be associated
8988920	8990920	with the nobility of the plague
8990920	8992920	yes there is a very
8992920	8994920	viral clip that
8994920	8996920	a guy is being interviewed
8996920	8998920	um
8998920	9000920	and
9000920	9002920	oh god what was the word
9002920	9004920	i can see the interview in my head
9004920	9006920	it's an english interview
9006920	9008920	and the guy
9008920	9010920	speaks what we call
9010920	9012920	posh english
9012920	9014920	and then the guy replies
9014920	9016920	tomorrow that's it
9016920	9018920	the guy goes like tomorrow
9018920	9020920	and then the guy replies tomorrow
9020920	9022920	it's like not trying to correct him
9022920	9024920	but he's trying to be like wow
9024920	9026920	look at the difference in this regional accent
9026920	9028920	but the problem
9028920	9030920	with it
9030920	9032920	it's not that problematic relax before you're like
9032920	9034920	well steady on you've got blue hair haven't you
9034920	9036920	nah relax i ain't got blue hair
9036920	9038920	calm it fenny's in on the opposite of me
9038920	9040920	um
9040920	9042920	the kind of thing was it
9042920	9044920	is because posh english accents
9044920	9046920	are associated with wealth
9046920	9048920	are associated with grammar schools
9048920	9050920	for example a grammar school is
9050920	9052920	a rich person school
9052920	9054920	high education school
9054920	9056920	public education is kind of
9056920	9058920	associated with not necessarily
9058920	9060920	pro but if you can't afford public education
9060920	9062920	you can't afford it
9062920	9064920	um
9064920	9066920	so the guy was like oh
9066920	9068920	look at this accent
9068920	9070920	this man clearly
9070920	9072920	you know wasn't educated
9072920	9074920	in a grammar school type thing and that's
9074920	9076920	when it becomes a wee bit of an issue
9076920	9078920	uh received pronunciation
9078920	9080920	uh
9080920	9082920	it's them also calling it the queens english
9082920	9084920	yeah just finding out
9084920	9086920	it's not glass
9086920	9088920	wait glass go
9088920	9090920	it's a shame
9090920	9092920	it's fine if you accidentally name a city wrong
9092920	9094920	like edinburgh
9094920	9096920	and edinburgh is normally pronounced
9096920	9098920	edinburgh
9098920	9100920	by folk who don't come from here
9100920	9102920	that's perfectly normal
9102920	9104920	i'm sure i say all these
9104920	9106920	applications in different countries wrong as well
9106920	9108920	like arkansas
9108920	9110920	is arkansas and like
9110920	9112920	mississippi and
9112920	9114920	what's another state in america
9114920	9116920	um road islands
9116920	9118920	um colorado
9118920	9120920	i'm sure i say it funny so please
9120920	9122920	don't ever be embarrassed if you say it funny
9122920	9124920	um glass go is said glass go
9124920	9126920	but in the
9126920	9128920	regional dialect it can also be
9128920	9130920	glazga um
9130920	9132920	don't ask why it's glazga it just
9132920	9134920	glazga um
9134920	9136920	texas yeah i'm sure i'll say
9136920	9138920	uh i don't know
9138920	9140920	if there's some locations
9140920	9142920	in the states that i can name
9142920	9144920	uh anaheim
9144920	9146920	is a place in
9146920	9148920	california because they
9148920	9150920	hold conventions
9150920	9152920	i'm pretty sure there was some
9152920	9154920	anaheim convention at one point
9154920	9156920	if i ever visit the uk i'll go to
9156920	9158920	glazga honestly it's
9158920	9160920	like such a nice although edinburgh
9160920	9162920	is pretty good for tourist stuff like
9162920	9164920	the edinburgh castle and
9164920	9166920	the edinburgh museum are pretty close together
9166920	9168920	um
9168920	9170920	did you say wheels is
9170920	9172920	associated with posh no wheels
9172920	9174920	in wheels wheels
9174920	9176920	is associated with kind of like the mining
9176920	9178920	towns and all of that and the
9178920	9180920	the welsh accent
9180920	9182920	i can't do
9182920	9184920	what is the welsh accent
9186920	9188920	i can't think of a welsh uh sentence
9188920	9190920	specifically to start the accent
9192920	9194920	have you had a coke and rum please
9194920	9196920	oh no the only example
9196920	9198920	of welsh accent i have
9198920	9200920	is this little
9200920	9202920	britain skit where the guy's like
9202920	9204920	i'm the only gay in the village
9204920	9206920	because he was like was so proudful but
9206920	9208920	i was like no don't be silly that
9208920	9210920	guys or that girl
9210920	9212920	or that lass like type thing and he's like
9212920	9214920	i'm the only gay in the village that's the only
9214920	9216920	exposure to the welsh accent
9216920	9218920	to be honest which is absolutely terrible
9218920	9220920	um all of a sudden
9220920	9222920	we're drifting up to the northern island
9222920	9224920	uh heavenly father
9224920	9226920	who art in heaven hello to be thy name
9226920	9228920	today we're gathered with the reeflings
9228920	9230920	at hedgeville uh we're currently
9230920	9232920	cooking up a storm with swordfish
9232920	9234920	but we still have a high burn rate
9234920	9236920	my burn rate is 17 percent now are you
9236920	9238920	joking why is my burn rate
9238920	9240920	getting higher i'm leveling up
9242920	9244920	wheels is associated with sheep
9244920	9246920	i will tell you the reason why wheels are
9246920	9248920	associated with sheep it was
9248920	9250920	elite well it's illegal to
9250920	9252920	steal a farmer's sheep it
9252920	9254920	wasn't at the time many a year
9254920	9256920	ago to um to
9256920	9258920	have um
9258920	9260920	actions with a sheep
9260920	9262920	which is why
9262920	9264920	people would pretend
9264920	9266920	that they had had action
9266920	9268920	with a sheep instead
9268920	9270920	of stealing it because you can't
9270920	9272920	get arrested for actions but you could
9272920	9274920	get arrested for stealing at the time
9274920	9276920	okay that is why
9276920	9278920	poor welsh people have to deal with
9278920	9280920	that stereotype and it's such a shame
9282920	9284920	um because it's not true you just
9284920	9286920	need to know a little bit of history to understand
9286920	9288920	a little bit more
9288920	9290920	abridonians profusely
9290920	9292920	sweating aye what is it abridine
9292920	9294920	abridine can he kick her jelly
9296920	9298920	absolutely short in behaviour
9298920	9300920	stealing was the death penalty
9300920	9302920	yes okay that would be it
9302920	9304920	it was even more severe than i originally
9304920	9306920	had anticipated
9306920	9308920	i shan't be in scottish i'm getting
9308920	9310920	the football off i

9514920	9516920	and um
9516920	9518920	what's that other word simp
9518920	9520920	like a ban phrase on twitch now
9520920	9522920	do they still do that do they still
9522920	9524920	moderate that
9524920	9526920	i remember it got banned and i was like
9526920	9528920	isn't that
9528920	9530920	like i don't like the word simp
9530920	9532920	because i feel like it's used anytime
9532920	9534920	where a guy just genuinely enjoys content
9534920	9536920	from a girl which is so like it's quite
9536920	9538920	frustrating because it's just like
9538920	9540920	i don't like the terminology
9540920	9542920	but to like outright ban it
9542920	9544920	is like what did i miss a few
9544920	9546920	yeah twitch doesn't allow those words
9546920	9548920	but i've never really tested it out
9550920	9552920	you can get banned for it that's pretty
9552920	9554920	um
9554920	9556920	yeah like i'm pretty tired of the
9556920	9558920	word simp because i think it's used whenever
9558920	9560920	someone just genuinely enjoys content
9560920	9562920	that just happens to be from a chick like it's
9562920	9564920	really
9564920	9566920	but anyway i think outright ban in it is like
9566920	9568920	a bit severe i just hope
9568920	9570920	that the definition
9570920	9572920	slowly changes over time did someone just
9572920	9574920	talk there no
9574920	9576920	maybe later oh wait was that for me
9576920	9578920	oh my god i wasn't paying attention
9578920	9580920	ebes was that for me
9582920	9584920	uh
9584920	9586920	the moderation
9586920	9588920	is inconsistent say the least
9588920	9590920	yeah it's why i don't really enjoy
9590920	9592920	twitch a lot of people right why not
9592920	9594920	twitch why not twitch but i have seen countless
9594920	9596920	examples of what
9596920	9598920	how they don't apply the rules
9598920	9600920	fairly at least with youtube
9600920	9602920	it does seem like
9602920	9604920	a overall blanket
9604920	9606920	which is very easy
9606920	9608920	to be like oh okay right because
9608920	9610920	like um now i'm aware
9610920	9612920	that you're looking isn't allowed now
9612920	9614920	i don't know why
9614920	9616920	older videos that are made eons back
9616920	9618920	are fine but recently not
9618920	9620920	no like azura was eating
9620920	9622920	a cookie azura
9622920	9624920	was eating a cookie and she got
9624920	9626920	a warning for um enjoying
9626920	9628920	a cookie just because her voice is so
9628920	9630920	silky smooth um
9632920	9634920	it's definitely being generalized to any sort of kindness
9634920	9636920	towards a person but especially women
9636920	9638920	yeah like it's why
9638920	9640920	i'm i'm pretty tired of hearing about it
9640920	9642920	to be honest like i think it's overstate
9642920	9644920	it's welcome to because it just
9644920	9646920	gets used to oh you enjoy
9646920	9648920	any type of content from women
9648920	9650920	and it's like bro
9650920	9652920	i'm just here to enjoy the runescape streams
9652920	9654920	like my god i'm here to enjoy the rambles
9654920	9656920	and how we're going to take down
9656920	9658920	the big banks um
9660920	9662920	i prefer youtube twitch
9662920	9664920	reason sub prices oh my gosh
9664920	9666920	yes at least with youtube you
9666920	9668920	can decide on membership price i
9668920	9670920	see that as if i didn't begrudgingly
9670920	9672920	raise my price by a dollar of
9672920	9674920	pure rage but i will make it up
9674920	9676920	i will do as much streaming
9676920	9678920	as i can to to earn that money
9678920	9680920	um
9680920	9682920	but yeah twitch
9682920	9684920	just seems to be taking
9684920	9686920	a sin moving to youtube
9686920	9688920	if you type in
9688920	9690920	twitch that you're
9690920	9692920	an age you get by
9692920	9694920	100% yeah
9694920	9696920	it was a very
9696920	9698920	mmm mmm cookie indeed
9698920	9700920	can't eat a cookie on stream
9700920	9702920	youtube is really crumbling apart

9708920	9710920	that myself thank you hi reeflings
9710920	9712920	oh it's the person that i actually got
9712920	9714920	the name reefling after like five hours
9714920	9716920	hi reefling reefling
9718920	9720920	no no i came up with that joke
9720920	9722920	myself i promise it totally

9724920	9726920	how is she looking how is she looking
9726920	9728920	sideways is she supposed to be looking
9728920	9730920	sideways
9730920	9732920	i just really she's never looking
9732920	9734920	why are you looking
9734920	9736920	to the side i know maybe she got
9736920	9738920	like a sore neck or something that's okay
9742920	9744920	yeah i didn't miss the
9744920	9746920	yeah
9746920	9748920	it turns out all i had to do was open
9748920	9750920	the application in order for it to make
9750920	9752920	noise i accidentally
9752920	9754920	closed it the other time i tried it
9754920	9756920	and couldn't figure out why
9756920	9758920	she's so shy she can't look us in the eyes
9758920	9760920	honestly like look into my eyes
9760920	9762920	not around my eyes
9762920	9764920	yeah
9764920	9766920	it's like when you see a guy call someone
9766920	9768920	a simple watching girl and then you look
9768920	9770920	and they watch some big muscle male streamer
9770920	9772920	for nine hours a day but that doesn't
9772920	9774920	count
9774920	9776920	allegedly glorkin hard
9776920	9778920	on it but
9778920	9780920	he's a whammin bad but male
9780920	9782920	good
9782920	9784920	bruv we're tired
9784920	9786920	bruv let's just enjoy let's just enjoy the
9786920	9788920	conspiracy through okay let's just enjoy him
9788920	9790920	if it makes you
9790920	9792920	a simp for listening to me
9792920	9794920	coconut my cheeks
9794920	9796920	and make them clap for 15 minutes
9796920	9798920	and hey ho
9798920	9800920	then hey ho
9800920	9802920	snakes and stones may may break
9802920	9804920	my bones but you'll never get
9804920	9806920	more quality content
9806920	9808920	from another streamer
9808920	9810920	when it comes to ASMR no that's a lie
9810920	9812920	that's a lie
9812920	9814920	oh 8.6
9814920	9816920	8.6
9816920	9818920	bronze
9818920	9820920	my issue with twitch at the moment is
9820920	9822920	something about the vtuber
9822920	9824920	yes that was a recent tos update
9824920	9826920	if you did not hear the news
9826920	9828920	vtubers now
9828920	9830920	must
9830920	9832920	conform
9832920	9834920	to the attire
9834920	9836920	rules of in real life streamers
9836920	9838920	but the problem with that is a lot
9838920	9840920	of vtuber models you know
9840920	9842920	they have a bit of appeal to them
9842920	9844920	a bit of personality on show if you will
9844920	9846920	and because of twitch
9846920	9848920	is incant who goes there
9848920	9850920	inconsistencies
9850920	9852920	it's very hard to ascertain
9852920	9854920	if
9854920	9856920	if
9856920	9858920	oops sorry whoa
9858920	9860920	how do I do that
9860920	9862920	hold on I'm just gonna check

9906920	9908920	because I am locking in
9908920	9910920	an endurance stream today

9922920	9924920	please do not
9924920	9926920	I've locked in for a 12 hour stream
9926920	9928920	you will not see me offline
9928920	9930920	until 11 hours and 55 minutes
9930920	9932920	cause that is exactly when the vod breaks
9932920	9934920	em
9934920	9936920	so please do not be afraid to watch
9936920	9938920	my gen mates and enjoy them
9938920	9940920	and then you are welcome to
9940920	9942920	come back to me at any time
9942920	9944920	whoa this person got gardening
9944920	9946920	gardening isn't got
9946920	9948920	a freaking cabbage on your back
9948920	9950920	aww you got green cakes
9950920	9952920	aww I forgot to buy his green cakes
9952920	9954920	we should probably buy green cakes
9954920	9956920	aren't the twitch attire standards
9956920	9958920	based on what you are? doesn't that mean vtuber
9958920	9960920	need to... yeah so
9960920	9962920	on twitch
9962920	9964920	you can stream in a bikini
9964920	9966920	if you are in a pool
9966920	9968920	or a hot tub
9968920	9970920	so that is like saying I could pop
9970920	9972920	up on my bikini toggle right now
9972920	9974920	and put like a hot tub asset
9974920	9976920	and then I am good to go question mark
9976920	9978920	like that seems pretty redundant
9978920	9980920	em I will close that cause it is kind of
9980920	9982920	covering up
9984920	9986920	em
9986920	9988920	don't forget that twitch has the hot tub category
9988920	9990920	which is only worth watching
9990920	9992920	when some insane guy in a lab coat
9992920	9994920	show oh no the fire
9994920	9996920	we got so distracted
9996920	9998920	we got so distracted talking about the
9998920	10000920	um
10000920	10002920	let me take the ashes
10002920	10004920	so they don't get in the way
10004920	10006920	I thought ashes got in the way of cooking
10006920	10008920	am I going crazy did I make that up
10008920	10010920	fire
10010920	10012920	thank you much
10012920	10014920	more depreciation
10014920	10016920	I completely forgot what I was saying
10016920	10018920	in real life youtube is
10018920	10020920	barely having a time I feel like they get away with
10020920	10022920	anything
10022920	10024920	youtube is definitely more
10024920	10026920	wait am I dumb
10026920	10028920	youtube is definitely
10028920	10030920	so much nicer than me
10030920	10032920	em
10032920	10034920	it's just the facts bro
10034920	10036920	I'm sorry you can argue
10036920	10038920	to a wall cause my burn rate
10038920	10040920	keeps going up
10040920	10042920	stop
10042920	10044920	stop burning
10044920	10046920	you shouldn't be burning
10046920	10048920	em
10048920	10050920	I'm here for the long haul
10050920	10052920	oh yeah you got endurance for 12 hours
10052920	10054920	abusing mods
10054920	10056920	streamer abusing mods
10056920	10058920	but they like it though
10060920	10062920	don't you mods
10062920	10064920	but you can't speak
10064920	10066920	this is a one sided conversation
10068920	10070920	em
10070920	10072920	I think all the girls got extra mods
10072920	10074920	by the way so do check your discord
10074920	10076920	or whatever you applied with
10076920	10078920	I have no idea I didn't handle the mods
10078920	10080920	so if you got picked as a mod congrats
10080920	10082920	wasn't it me
10082920	10084920	em
10084920	10086920	but do check cause I think
10086920	10088920	3 people didn't respond
10088920	10090920	even though they were super keen
10090920	10092920	em
10092920	10094920	twitch
10094920	10096920	admins have their favourite
10096920	10098920	mods and shambles
10098920	10100920	tell me about the dude with the lab coat
10100920	10102920	in the bikini
10102920	10104920	wait is that real
10104920	10106920	gotta get your hair blow up
10106920	10108920	there are potions to help you last
10108920	10110920	longer
10110920	10112920	oh my god that's terrible
10112920	10114920	mods aren't real they're like birds
10114920	10116920	post what you want
10116920	10118920	alright I do have mods
10118920	10120920	we need to keep things above board
10120920	10122920	ok
10122920	10124920	another mod flexing on you
10124920	10126920	by deleting your message
10126920	10128920	lmao
10128920	10130920	and slap
10130920	10132920	I don't know what the lab coat thing is though
10132920	10134920	twitch feels better
10134920	10136920	as a dedicated streaming site
10136920	10138920	but the actual infrastructure management is awful
10138920	10140920	yeah I would say discoverability
10140920	10142920	on youtube
10142920	10144920	is so much better
10144920	10146920	in my opinion especially
10146920	10148920	with the shorts algorithm
10148920	10150920	I would say on twitch the only
10150920	10152920	way I could
10152920	10154920	you know foresee
10154920	10156920	someone
10156920	10158920	em
10158920	10160920	fore fore see
10162920	10164920	foresee someone being
10164920	10166920	em
10166920	10168920	discovered
10168920	10170920	is the raid option
10170920	10172920	which is called redirect on youtube
10172920	10174920	if you get
10174920	10176920	a streamer that is kind enough
10176920	10178920	and is massive and raids into you
10178920	10180920	it can literally
10180920	10182920	make or break you as a streamer
10182920	10184920	it's pretty insane it really is
10184920	10186920	em
10186920	10188920	I have told the girls please
10188920	10190920	to always raid into each other
10190920	10192920	to keep a train going
10192920	10194920	if no other talent
10194920	10196920	is online then you're more than welcome
10196920	10198920	to raid into another agency
10198920	10200920	no problem at all
10200920	10202920	like I
10202920	10204920	yesterday called in a favour
10204920	10206920	with a friend
10206920	10208920	mimosa
10208920	10210920	was it yesterday?
10210920	10212920	no it must have been the other day
10212920	10214920	she was so polite
10214920	10216920	and I said look I'll raid into you
10216920	10218920	but do me a favour when you finish up your stream
10218920	10220920	raid back into a violour girl
10220920	10222920	and she said that is more than happy
10222920	10224920	with those terms and I was like yeah
10224920	10226920	I'm more than happy calling a favour for a friend
10230920	10232920	yes I
10232920	10234920	absolutely don't mind it at all
10234920	10236920	the v and u girls have been absolutely
10236920	10238920	fantastic some of them have been
10238920	10240920	raiding into me I actually need to start
10240920	10242920	messaging some of them and being like hey you have
10242920	10244920	3d o microphone question mark question mark
10244920	10246920	em
10246920	10248920	I still find the violour mentality
10248920	10250920	of mods please do this thing thank you
10250920	10252920	now please be quiet affectionately
10254920	10256920	yes em
10256920	10258920	it's very
10258920	10260920	I don't want to say jarring
10260920	10262920	em but for someone
10262920	10264920	who may be new to stream
10264920	10266920	and
10266920	10268920	the streamer
10268920	10270920	is having a repertoire
10270920	10272920	but a back and forth with mods
10272920	10274920	that are named it's a bit not
10274920	10276920	isolated but it's like
10276920	10278920	it feels like you've missed out on lore
10278920	10280920	and it just gets harder to enjoy the streamer
10280920	10282920	like someone could be lurking watching
10282920	10284920	me for the first time right now
10284920	10286920	em and just being like
10286920	10288920	was she all about type thing and if I'm like
10288920	10290920	oh mod x mod this mod y
10290920	10292920	mod b mod c and like
10292920	10294920	cracking like you jokes all the time
10294920	10296920	em like it's not
10296920	10298920	very
10298920	10300920	enabling to come in for the first
10300920	10302920	time
10302920	10304920	em whereas I quite
10304920	10306920	like the mods don't speak
10306920	10308920	but we are incredibly appreciative
10308920	10310920	for you you know mopping
10310920	10312920	mopping the floors
10312920	10314920	and making sure everything is good to go in
10314920	10316920	stream yaw
10316920	10318920	em
10318920	10320920	do shorts still work for discovery
10320920	10322920	emory said they
10322920	10324920	attached dead people to the channel
10324920	10326920	no
10326920	10328920	emy isn't entirely wrong
10328920	10330920	but she isn't entirely right
10330920	10332920	shorts
10332920	10334920	definitely have a subscription
10334920	10336920	subscriber count
10336920	10338920	effect
10338920	10340920	em and they also have discoverability
10340920	10342920	effect
10342920	10344920	not all shorts people
10344920	10346920	who will subscribe to you will show up in a
10346920	10348920	live stream that's just facts
10348920	10350920	some people purely enjoy shorts
10350920	10352920	mind rot and they will just
10352920	10354920	watch shorts and nothing else that's
10354920	10356920	perfectly fine so emy is both
10356920	10358920	right and both a wee bit wrong
10358920	10360920	it's very good em I do
10360920	10362920	have
10362920	10364920	brah I have three
10364920	10366920	shorts editors and all three
10366920	10368920	of them are busy for a couple of weeks
10368920	10370920	and I could absolutely smash their faces
10370920	10372920	because I need help I don't have
10372920	10374920	editing skills
10374920	10376920	em I think I'm going to have to reach
10376920	10378920	out to an editor that I like
10378920	10380920	to style of
10380920	10382920	because I'm drowning
10382920	10384920	I need help with shorts and I do not
10384920	10386920	have the skills for it nor do I
10386920	10388920	have the time for it but I'm
10388920	10390920	now that the girls are monetized I'm wanting
10390920	10392920	to
10392920	10394920	close through em I'm wanting
10394920	10396920	to start pushing out shorts for the
10396920	10398920	baby girls now em to help
10398920	10400920	with overall sub count
10400920	10402920	we are going to put some advertisements
10402920	10404920	into the shorts as well so
10404920	10406920	some might have more views and others
10406920	10408920	and we'll take it from there
10408920	10410920	look it's just a kind of
10410920	10412920	em my current goal once
10412920	10414920	everyone has done their celebration monetization
10414920	10416920	stream is my current goals I'm going to
10416920	10418920	get everyone to 5k subscribers
10418920	10420920	em
10420920	10422920	which
10422920	10424920	shouldn't really be
10424920	10426920	too hard
10426920	10428920	em I do have a collab
10428920	10430920	ASMR that's going to go on AC's
10430920	10432920	channel em which should help
10432920	10434920	boost her a little bit em
10434920	10436920	because the culling was just so
10436920	10438920	65
10438920	10440920	wait we're going to approach the naughty
10440920	10442920	number soon
10442920	10444920	any naughty number approaches me
10444920	10446920	em
10446920	10448920	new viewers feel like they are walking
10448920	10450920	into a friend group yes
10450920	10452920	it definitely
10452920	10454920	em
10454920	10456920	especially whenever I
10456920	10458920	kind of
10458920	10460920	talk I like to say
10460920	10462920	oh I spoke about this yesterday but
10462920	10464920	don't worry if you weren't there
10464920	10466920	because it's also quite
10466920	10468920	nice and kind language to use
10468920	10470920	for people who may genuinely
10470920	10472920	who couldn't have been there
10472920	10474920	em
10474920	10476920	types of how do I keep
10476920	10478920	doing that I don't know how I keep doing that
10478920	10480920	I'm being such a silly bully with that
10480920	10482920	em whoa
10482920	10484920	8.4 okay at 8000
10484920	10486920	I will call a break
10486920	10488920	and I'm going to pee get a cup of tea
10488920	10490920	get some snacks em
10490920	10492920	and hopefully Gimli doesn't
10492920	10494920	come flying into the room the moment I open
10494920	10496920	the door but I think she may
10496920	10498920	em
10498920	10500920	if the streamer is only talking to their moz
10500920	10502920	that's fault the rest of the chat
10502920	10504920	your sub count will be inflated
10504920	10506920	but it's still a net positive it's a positive
10506920	10508920	overall I
10508920	10510920	I'm happy to see this publicly I
10510920	10512920	really want to get play buttons for the girls
10512920	10514920	I think
10514920	10516920	I would absolutely love that
10516920	10518920	em
10518920	10520920	it'll take time
10520920	10522920	it will take hard work it'll take dedication
10522920	10524920	but em
10524920	10526920	I will show the girls what
10526920	10528920	is working for me what has worked what is
10528920	10530920	working em and
10530920	10532920	you know
10532920	10534920	if they do shorts with me if they do
10534920	10536920	ASMR collabs with other girls
10536920	10538920	em if they do
10538920	10540920	zoom collabs with the girls
10540920	10542920	em I think it is very
10542920	10544920	possible I actually
10544920	10546920	do not see it as an impossibility
10546920	10548920	if the girls let me cook and
10548920	10550920	equally they also cook
10550920	10552920	em I think it would be
10552920	10554920	absolutely lovely to get the girls play buttons
10554920	10556920	and before anyone
10556920	10558920	asks is Veeler holding the play buttons
10558920	10560920	eh no
10560920	10562920	why I'll say it again
10562920	10564920	I
10564920	10566920	would never
10566920	10568920	ever hold
10568920	10570920	a beautiful symbol
10570920	10572920	of their hard work their dedication
10572920	10574920	their love for their craft
10574920	10576920	their love for their community
10576920	10578920	from the girl
10578920	10580920	absolutely not pointing fingers
10580920	10582920	but
10582920	10584920	I think it is very clear
10584920	10586920	there is
10586920	10588920	corporate greedy agencies
10588920	10590920	that care about accolades
10590920	10592920	to prevent them
10592920	10594920	from to prevent their talents
10594920	10596920	from holding such a beautiful symbol
10596920	10598920	and then there are
10598920	10600920	agencies like Veeler that says do whatever you want
10600920	10602920	here's the money
10602920	10604920	basically here do
10604920	10606920	you want have fun here's your money
10606920	10608920	here's your play button
10608920	10610920	em yes
10610920	10612920	you don't want the play button on your
10612920	10614920	giant mega yacht no
10614920	10616920	I absolutely do not
10616920	10618920	care for that
10618920	10620920	right I have to ask I actually don't know
10620920	10622920	if it's real I only hear it from the memes
10622920	10624920	is the yacht real is there actually
10624920	10626920	a yacht or is it or is it just a meme
10628920	10630920	hello do you plan on playing
10630920	10632920	Titanfall 2 absolutely
10632920	10634920	it's a fantastic game
10634920	10636920	I would love to give it a
10636920	10638920	a shot
10638920	10640920	for the first time as Stronu Cuddles

10644920	10646920	together and this time
10646920	10648920	I will get uppies from the correct BT
10648920	10650920	and not an enemy that
10650920	10652920	freaked me out because I could have sworn
10652920	10654920	it was
10654920	10656920	nah it's a meme
10656920	10658920	okay it's a meme okay I thought it was real
10658920	10660920	I thought it was actually
10660920	10662920	real and someone was like oh my god
10662920	10664920	this person owns an actual yacht on the
10664920	10666920	back of these VTubers hard
10666920	10668920	work and
10668920	10670920	I don't know who it is

11006920	11008920	for a week the algorithm isn't going to know you're
11008920	11010920	asking for Azura delay the VTuber
11010920	11012920	you have to type Azura as a
11012920	11014920	ure a space de ure

11016920	11018920	I know it has a T

11020920	11022920	you drop the T wow wait wait wait
11022920	11024920	whoa whoa whoa whoa
11024920	11026920	French and Scottish people drop in the T
11026920	11028920	in their pronunciations what's going on here
11028920	11030920	no
11030920	11032920	I simply type the surname with the double
11032920	11034920	L that's the problem
11034920	11036920	Katoos you gotta
11036920	11038920	give them the government name oh
11038920	11040920	silly how silly how could you forget
11040920	11042920	scrolling
11042920	11044920	Pinterest
11044920	11046920	and it's just AI generated pics
11046920	11048920	of koalas with big
11048920	11050920	what wait what
11050920	11052920	did you type in one of our
11052920	11054920	VTuber names and then came up with that
11054920	11056920	by the way strongy since I never
11056920	11058920	played Rinscape could you sell me on it
11058920	11060920	number go up
11060920	11062920	yippee
11062920	11064920	it is a slow incremental
11064920	11066920	game although it well depends
11066920	11068920	on how you want to play it I
11068920	11070920	am literally just cooking
11070920	11072920	I'm cooking away look see this little
11072920	11074920	progress bar cooking
11074920	11076920	I'm currently level 65
11076920	11078920	and cooking and
11078920	11080920	I
11080920	11082920	I'm watching
11082920	11084920	the bar slowly go up
11084920	11086920	and it's beautiful
11086920	11088920	and I get dopamine
11088920	11090920	every time I says I level up in the game
11090920	11092920	it's gorgeous I just can't help it
11094920	11096920	I'mma be real I'm not even here for the
11096920	11098920	gameplay I'm here for rambling while I play Isaac
11098920	11100920	I thought about doing Eden Isaac
11100920	11102920	runs shortly
11102920	11104920	for like a shorter stream idea
11104920	11106920	if you didn't know the most
11106920	11108920	Isaac runs last one hour
11108920	11110920	so I thought maybe for a shorter stream
11110920	11112920	I would purposely do a four hour
11112920	11114920	stream so I can redirect into Emmy
11114920	11116920	because I never redirect
11116920	11118920	into Emmy I finally got to redirect
11118920	11120920	into Azura yesterday
11120920	11122920	and but I never do it
11122920	11124920	for Emmy and I can never do it
11124920	11126920	for Icy unless I pulled an all
11126920	11128920	nighter I might pull an all nighter
11128920	11130920	so I can say I redirected into
11130920	11132920	Icy just to be a smug little about it
11134920	11136920	but I wanted to do
11136920	11138920	a four hour stream so I can redirect into Emmy
11138920	11140920	at one point because poor Emmy never gets
11140920	11142920	redirected in my reeflings
11142920	11144920	are never exposed to Emmy
11144920	11146920	and what sentence
11146920	11148920	I didn't even mean that sometimes I mean it
11148920	11150920	when I say sentences and sometimes the
11150920	11152920	sentences just have happened
11152920	11154920	I thought dropping T was an American tip
11154920	11156920	not the harbor
11156920	11158920	don't remind me of all
11158920	11160920	that beautiful tea
11162920	11164920	this is a preparation but she cooking

11220920	11222920	what reason she has a migraine for
11222920	11224920	because I'm pretty sure migraines have no
11224920	11226920	rhyme or reason but I'm like 99%
11226920	11228920	sure she was crying
11228920	11230920	happy tears might have affected it and she
11230920	11232920	maybe is pretty dehydrated right now

11428920	11430920	crazy you can't do
11430920	11432920	that I was caught by surprise away

11436920	11438920	death to keep you safe scrawny thank you
11438920	11440920	I appreciate it
11442920	11444920	no I am far too busy I'm
11444920	11446920	I'm not going to say too much
11446920	11448920	because I want to respect my
11448920	11450920	my girls my gen ones I've obviously
11450920	11452920	doing a lot cooking actually that remains
11452920	11454920	many to go ask for a collaboration from another
11454920	11456920	VTuber and I have no idea if they're going to accept
11456920	11458920	they might accept they might not
11458920	11460920	hey ho we'll try
11462920	11464920	currently gen 2 is cooking
11464920	11466920	and yeah no I'm not naming
11466920	11468920	them you'll be happy to know
11468920	11470920	I'm not naming them
11470920	11472920	but it's very
11472920	11474920	busy trying to maintain everything
11474920	11476920	all at once
11478920	11480920	but I did say I'm a workaholic
11480920	11482920	and I really
11482920	11484920	enjoy working I
11484920	11486920	enjoy giving value for money as well
11486920	11488920	especially in this day and age
11488920	11490920	where everything's getting
11490920	11492920	greedier and greedier I'm like no
11492920	11494920	we're going to do a business tactic
11494920	11496920	called undercut in the market
11496920	11498920	yay
11498920	11500920	undercut undercut
11500920	11502920	that kind of thing
11502920	11504920	damn the hey ho gets moved
11504920	11506920	hey ho let me finish
11506920	11508920	my point now
11508920	11510920	I really like pushing myself
11510920	11512920	to offer value for money
11512920	11514920	it's why even with membership
11514920	11516920	streams like on days where we do a membership stream
11516920	11518920	I'm still going to do a cheeky 2 over stream
11518920	11520920	for it
11520920	11522920	and then we can enjoy our
11522920	11524920	more cuddly membership streams
11524920	11526920	I have absolutely no issue with that
11526920	11528920	it doesn't bother me none
11528920	11530920	and life is good
11530920	11532920	we are bingchining
11532920	11534920	bingchining
11534920	11536920	undercut in the market
11536920	11538920	love
11538920	11540920	as I said a bit earlier
11540920	11542920	but for the harem
11542920	11544920	that might not have been here when I was rambling about it
11544920	11546920	I was saying that even if you
11546920	11548920	cannot physically give any money
11548920	11550920	to the creator you're watching
11550920	11552920	just liking the stream
11552920	11554920	or subscribing to them
11554920	11556920	or just hanging out and lurking
11556920	11558920	all of this contributes
11558920	11560920	to the algorithm and leads for the girls
11560920	11562920	to more success
11562920	11564920	especially vaude watchers
11564920	11566920	special shout out to vaude watchers
11568920	11570920	especially if the girl streams
11570920	11572920	in a not good time zone for you
11572920	11574920	if you go into
11574920	11576920	mersey's comment section
11576920	11578920	there's like one dedicated vaude watcher
11578920	11580920	and I'm like you are helping her out so much
11580920	11582920	I understand
11582920	11584920	watching live stream vaudes
11584920	11586920	is not the funnest thing
11586920	11588920	because the person isn't live
11588920	11590920	but a lot of you are saying
11590920	11592920	you kind of listen to me ramble in the background
11592920	11594920	that is perfect
11594920	11596920	because you engage
11596920	11598920	with the content for long periods of time
11598920	11600920	again boosting the algorithm
11600920	11602920	for the girl
11602920	11604920	having cross promotion
11604920	11606920	with the vealer girls
11606920	11608920	it's just fantastic
11608920	11610920	it really is
11610920	11612920	12 hours of content for free that is value
11612920	11614920	yes like I don't mind it
11614920	11616920	now it's absolutely
11616920	11618920	it's not I'm very serious when I say this
11618920	11620920	this is absolutely not a reflection
11620920	11622920	on any other
11622920	11624920	VTuber streamer whoever whatever
11624920	11626920	I
11626920	11628920	do not find
11628920	11630920	this to be a job
11630920	11632920	okay this is
11632920	11634920	fun I'm enjoying myself
11634920	11636920	I am breaking my voice
11636920	11638920	rambling to you talking about
11638920	11640920	all these plans I've got cooking
11640920	11642920	talking about how things are
11642920	11644920	like this doesn't feel a job
11644920	11646920	feel like a job and I feel
11646920	11648920	sorry for streamers
11648920	11650920	where it does feel like a job
11650920	11652920	and they can't publicly come out
11652920	11654920	and be like that
11654920	11656920	wow 66
11658920	11660920	maybe that should be my
11660920	11662920	donation
11662920	11664920	like a tip sound instead of
11664920	11666920	are you squiddin me right now although actually
11666920	11668920	I quite like are you squiddin me right now

11686920	11688920	time stamping on

11690920	11692920	me
11692920	11694920	because I do have plans to
11694920	11696920	clip the girls ASMR

11698920	11700920	in talks with someone to do it for me
11700920	11702920	but the problem
11702920	11704920	is you know the profits
11704920	11706920	aren't the profits won't be there
11706920	11708920	for the clipping ASMR thing but
11708920	11710920	you know what we'll get there
11710920	11712920	all of the

12046920	12048920	we flings you're allowed
12048920	12050920	to go take a drink if you like
12052920	12054920	right let's use it on the fire
12054920	12056920	did you
12056920	12058920	select the funny all bell
12058920	12060920	on the sub button exactly
12060920	12062920	i don't see azura's stream
12062920	12064920	i didn't display for me either
12064920	12066920	i only displayed mercies there
12066920	12068920	i
12068920	12070920	i am under the impression
12070920	12072920	that we are going to
12072920	12074920	be added to holodex
12074920	12076920	soon which is a website
12076920	12078920	which will
12078920	12080920	list all of our streams
12080920	12082920	and automatically do it to your time
12082920	12084920	zone
12084920	12086920	so
12088920	12090920	that will be coming soon
12090920	12092920	if i'm not mistaken
12096920	12098920	i don't know how it works
12098920	12100920	but it means that it will auto show you
12100920	12102920	everyone's stream
12102920	12104920	violor we did consider running our own
12104920	12106920	website but
12106920	12108920	it was like another expense
12108920	12110920	that you know what holodex does it
12110920	12112920	for free and i'd rather
12112920	12114920	put any expenses like back into the girls
12114920	12116920	back into shorts back into promotion
12118920	12120920	there is for those
12120920	12122920	pin pals that are listening in
12122920	12124920	and any snowberries
12124920	12126920	there may or may not be an asmr
12126920	12128920	coming
12128920	12130920	for snowberries and pin pals
12130920	12132920	i hope you enjoy it
12132920	12134920	when it does come out
12134920	12136920	but there's a little hint for you
12136920	12138920	yes
12138920	12140920	holodex takes an average of
12140920	12142920	20k on all channels
12142920	12144920	as prerequisite
12144920	12146920	ok well we're coming for it
12146920	12148920	for any
12148920	12150920	yappening
12150920	12152920	that you may have missed out on because you are watching
12152920	12154920	the good ending
12154920	12156920	on emmy
12156920	12158920	stream
12158920	12160920	long story
12160920	12162920	short
12162920	12164920	azura
12164920	12166920	is the last one that we
12166920	12168920	are waiting for monetization on
12168920	12170920	and all of the girls have been
12170920	12172920	successfully
12172920	12174920	monetized i really started
12174920	12176920	through that one
12176920	12178920	and the monetization streams will be
12178920	12180920	happening soon tm
12180920	12182920	you can become a member as a reefling
12182920	12184920	you can become a member as a snippet
12184920	12186920	and tomorrow
12186920	12188920	snowberries and pin pals
12188920	12190920	you can also
12190920	12192920	become a member
12192920	12194920	because the girls are doing their membership
12194920	12196920	celebration
12196920	12198920	so please do not worry though
12198920	12200920	the girls will always be streaming for free
12200920	12202920	as well they will not be
12202920	12204920	exclusively doing membership streams
12204920	12206920	that's not how it works around these parts
12206920	12208920	but please do look out for it
12208920	12210920	because once my
12210920	12212920	endurance stream ends
12212920	12214920	for 12 hours i'm doing a cheeky endurance stream
12214920	12216920	once my stream ends
12216920	12218920	i am going to be the one pulling the strings
12218920	12220920	behind the scenes and opening up membership
12220920	12222920	so if you really wanted to get it
12222920	12224920	before the stream you can
12224920	12226920	but it's better to do it on stream
12226920	12228920	because the girls will say your name
12230920	12232920	do you want to hear the girls say your name
12232920	12234920	don't be silly
12234920	12236920	let the girls say your name
12238920	12240920	my wallet isn't paying waiting for membership
12240920	12242920	you can become a vill
12242920	12244920	oh okay
12244920	12246920	this isn't emmy in game before anyone
12246920	12248920	thinks it's actually emmy
12248920	12250920	that's hilarious though
12250920	12252920	we've got a pin pal
12252920	12254920	and they're waiting on emmy
12254920	12256920	singing
12256920	12258920	say mommy would you like us
12258920	12260920	to send you emmy's latest deleted audio

12340920	12342920	join them mommy
12342920	12344920	the allegations are unfounded

12616920	12618920	hours to remember to say one
12618920	12620920	sentence and i fail the
12620920	12622920	challenge every single time you guys are
12622920	12624920	just gonna have to do it in the chat for me
12624920	12626920	it's kinda ridiculous um
12626920	12628920	right so this is currently
12628920	12630920	uh
12630920	12632920	oh i guess it didn't update so you
12632920	12634920	can see like all the stats wait i'll update
12634920	12636920	it to the new one hold on
12636920	12638920	um it didn't update too much
12638920	12640920	cause i'm live
12640920	12642920	boom
12642920	12644920	so if you've never seen the behind the scenes before
12644920	12646920	this is what it looks like when you
12646920	12648920	upload a youtube video
12648920	12650920	these are the statistics
12650920	12652920	you get you get your viewers you get
12652920	12654920	your watch time you get the subscribers that
12654920	12656920	were directly earned
12656920	12658920	from that video so people
12658920	12660920	discovered that video for the first time and they click
12660920	12662920	subscribe because they really enjoyed me
12662920	12664920	pleading with you to let me hold
12664920	12666920	it as much
12666920	12668920	um the reason why
12668920	12670920	estimated revenue is not
12670920	12672920	visible is because it takes 48
12672920	12674920	hours for that statistic to update
12674920	12676920	if you guys really want to see it
12676920	12678920	i'm more than happy to share it doesn't bother me
12678920	12680920	none and
12680920	12682920	i and then you guys can

12832920	12834920	oh no my tight knit community
12834920	12836920	terrible we're in shambles
12836920	12838920	even though i'm finding major success
12838920	12840920	truly in shambles i'm on my knees
12840920	12842920	but yeah you're welcome
12842920	12844920	don't think that will work for long
12844920	12846920	well you'll be surprised
12846920	12848920	i've spoken to other asmr creators
12848920	12850920	especially twitch asmr creators
12850920	12852920	i had a friend
12852920	12854920	who used to stream asmr
12854920	12856920	and
12856920	12858920	she got
12858920	12860920	700 viewers
12860920	12862920	concurrent on asmr
12862920	12864920	and then she went and played a video game
12864920	12866920	and she got 40 viewers
12866920	12868920	and the entire chat
12868920	12870920	was spamming
12870920	12872920	someone would come in and spam when's your next asmr stream
12872920	12874920	and then leave again
12874920	12876920	it tried and true
12876920	12878920	i'm aware this
12878920	12880920	and it's gonna happen
12880920	12882920	it's just
12882920	12884920	facts
12884920	12886920	that logic is flawed
12886920	12888920	how dare you
12888920	12890920	how dare you say i'm dumb
12890920	12892920	even though i'm clearly dumb
12892920	12894920	but i've seen it happen on twitch
12894920	12896920	yeah
12896920	12898920	yeah it's not that uncommon for asmr streamers to branch out
12898920	12900920	yes no
12900920	12902920	it's a tactic
12902920	12904920	because i'm always gonna be a gamer
12904920	12906920	i'm always gonna be gaming every day
12906920	12908920	actually we're playing lego lord of the rings
12908920	12910920	i can't keep quiet about it
12910920	12912920	it's too back to back
12912920	12914920	streams again
12914920	12916920	i'm so excited
12916920	12918920	because on the first day
12918920	12920920	we play through all the missions
12920920	12922920	and
12922920	12924920	and
12924920	12926920	get like 100%
12926920	12928920	and then we get to play in middle earth and it's so fun
12928920	12930920	and i'm so excited to play
12930920	12932920	so yeah we get to play lego lord of the rings soon
12932920	12934920	and it's like one of my top games
12934920	12936920	because it's just so fun and perfect
12936920	12938920	although it always glitches out at this one ice lolly place
12938920	12940920	i will show you what i am always glitches out
12940920	12942920	and it annoys me to high heaven
12942920	12944920	because i've played the game all the time
12944920	12946920	lego lord of the rings
12946920	12948920	is super good lego game
12948920	12950920	will you still play hobbit afterwards
12950920	12952920	yes
12952920	12954920	i'll play hobo
12954920	12956920	4x67
12956920	12958920	i'll play lego hobbit
12958920	12960920	at a later date
12960920	12962920	it's not my favourite because
12962920	12964920	if you didn't know
12964920	12966920	well now you're gonna know
12966920	12968920	and insert my knowledge into your mind
12968920	12970920	um
12970920	12972920	lego hobbit is only 2 games long
12972920	12974920	and it just
12974920	12976920	abruptly ends
12976920	12978920	there's no public
12978920	12980920	explanation
12980920	12982920	that has been released
12982920	12984920	there are only theories
12984920	12986920	as to why only the 2
12986920	12988920	lego hobbit
12988920	12990920	2 hobbit first movies
12990920	12992920	were made
12992920	12994920	into the lego and not the third
12994920	12996920	but warner brother
12996920	12998920	being shitheads
12998920	13000920	it's just a mystery
13000920	13002920	why the game abruptly ends
13002920	13004920	at the 2 movie mark
13004920	13006920	but it just
13006920	13008920	is what it is
13008920	13010920	so unfortunately
13010920	13012920	i do not fully enjoy hobbit to the same way
13012920	13014920	i enjoy lord of the rings
13014920	13016920	i apologize
13016920	13018920	they lost the source code
13018920	13020920	no
13020920	13022920	i'm pretty sure warner brothers
13022920	13024920	is it warner brothers
13024920	13026920	as one of them
13026920	13028920	were being
13028920	13030920	they were being very
13030920	13032920	there was a lot of production issues
13032920	13034920	with the movie hobbit and then to base
13034920	13036920	something off of the movie to get the rights
13036920	13038920	to do something it probably
13038920	13040920	was just getting even worse
13040920	13042920	the production issues on the hobbit
13042920	13044920	were insane
13044920	13046920	i've kinda spoken about it but peter jackson
13046920	13048920	he's the director
13048920	13050920	he became so violently
13050920	13052920	ill
13052920	13054920	tending the fire for mummy
13054920	13056920	he became so violently
13056920	13058920	ill
13058920	13060920	he lost a bunch of weight he developed stomach ulcers
13060920	13062920	honestly i felt like peter jackson
13062920	13064920	when we were developing gen 1
13064920	13066920	i was getting ill
13066920	13068920	i honestly convinced myself at a few points
13068920	13070920	i was like this is it this stomach pain i feel right now
13070920	13072920	i've done it i've done it peter jackson
13072920	13074920	and then got myself a freaking
13074920	13076920	ulcer in my stomach
13076920	13078920	do you like the hobbit
13078920	13080920	yes i love the hobbit movies

13108920	13110920	who played the five string fiddle
13110920	13112920	he squeaked and he scored
13112920	13114920	and he quickened his tune oh wait i'm skipping
13114920	13116920	the lyrics someone needs to play the lyrics
13116920	13118920	of boffer's song

13126920	13128920	beneath the old grey hill
13128920	13130920	and there they brew a
13130920	13132920	beer so brown the man on the min himself
13132920	13134920	came down one night to drink his
13134920	13136920	wine

13144920	13146920	and the landlord
13146920	13148920	shook the man on the min
13148920	13150920	it's after three he said i can't remember the lyrics

13376920	13378920	that's planet air
13378920	13380920	turns
13380920	13382920	slowly
13382920	13384920	it's hard to stay
13384920	13386920	say i'd rather stay awake
13386920	13388920	when i'm asleep
13388920	13390920	actually i'm gonna do a meme song cover
13392920	13394920	you guys inspired me during
13394920	13396920	my james cameron's avatar stream
13396920	13398920	i am going to make
13398920	13400920	a meme song cover
13400920	13402920	of drumroll
13402920	13404920	secret tunnel but scottish
13406920	13408920	the artwork for it
13408920	13410920	someone drew a meme artwork
13410920	13412920	of me which i need to reach out and ask for permission
13412920	13414920	to use for it
13416920	13418920	but someone drew me
13418920	13420920	and then in the next frame
13420920	13422920	i'm blasting a scottish meme
13422920	13424920	and i want to use that artwork
13424920	13426920	in the music video
13426920	13428920	so
13428920	13430920	i'm going to see if i can do it
13430920	13432920	so basically
13432920	13434920	two lovers
13434920	13436920	i'm gonna get someone to mix it so at least i'm not
13436920	13438920	monotone deaf on it
13438920	13440920	forbidden be one another
13440920	13442920	and i'm actually gonna have to
13442920	13444920	write the lyrics out for the music video maker
13444920	13446920	because they're gonna be like
13446920	13448920	what is fey
13448920	13450920	from fey
13452920	13454920	secret tunnel
13454920	13456920	secret tunnel
13456920	13458920	through the mountain
13458920	13460920	secret secret
13460920	13462920	secret tunnel
13462920	13464920	basically it's gonna be like less than 50 seconds
13464920	13466920	but i think it's funny
13466920	13468920	little question for mome
13468920	13470920	are we eventually going back to needy streamer
13470920	13472920	overload for other endings
13472920	13474920	mmm
13474920	13476920	maybe a membership stream
13476920	13478920	i don't want to play games
13478920	13480920	i've already done before
13480920	13482920	but a short game like that
13482920	13484920	is very good for membership streams
13484920	13486920	in my opinion and again if you're not
13486920	13488920	membered and you're listening please don't worry
13488920	13490920	i stream for free every single day you get free content

13492920	13494920	okay just let me cook give me time

13542920	13544920	and a
13544920	13546920	tier list rating for the first
13546920	13548920	membership stream week
13548920	13550920	we're going to spend an awful long time
13550920	13552920	on that tier list rating so i do apologize
13552920	13554920	it's going to be a bit of an epic
13554920	13556920	bit of an epic
13556920	13558920	mmm
13558920	13560920	thank you
13560920	13562920	oh how's the toe
13562920	13564920	i
13564920	13566920	i might be
13566920	13568920	losing my toenail
13570920	13572920	so
13572920	13574920	i went to the doctor
13574920	13576920	managed to go to the doctor all good
13576920	13578920	and
13578920	13580920	they've given me
13580920	13582920	an option
13582920	13584920	they've given me an option
13584920	13586920	i can either remove a side of my toenail
13586920	13588920	or i can get the whole
13588920	13590920	thing taken off
13590920	13592920	and they told
13592920	13594920	me that
13594920	13596920	if i get
13596920	13598920	the side of it taken off
13598920	13600920	because of the shape
13600920	13602920	of my nails i have what's known as
13602920	13604920	C shape nails i have no idea
13604920	13606920	if anyone listening knows what that means
13606920	13608920	i have C shape nails
13608920	13610920	which means i
13610920	13612920	am more prone to this
13612920	13614920	issue
13614920	13616920	so they basically said
13616920	13618920	ingrown toenail that's what they said
13618920	13620920	i thought she cut into my skin
13620920	13622920	but she cut into my skin
13622920	13624920	and down the side of my nail
13624920	13626920	which is why it was so messed up
13626920	13628920	so
13628920	13630920	i have an option
13630920	13632920	to either get it cut on the side
13632920	13634920	a little bit or get the whole thing taken
13634920	13636920	off
13636920	13638920	and i've opted to get the whole thing taken
13638920	13640920	off because i can't be arsed
13640920	13642920	hahaha
13642920	13644920	i would just still love me
13644920	13646920	if i didn't have 10 toenails
13646920	13648920	they said
13648920	13650920	it doesn't grow back
13650920	13652920	for some reason your fingernails grow back
13652920	13654920	but your toes don't
13654920	13656920	so yeah
13656920	13658920	they said the risk
13658920	13660920	because of my nail shape
13660920	13662920	the risk of me having this problem
13662920	13664920	occurring is pretty high
13664920	13666920	but i thought i had normal toes
13666920	13668920	but apparently i have unique C shaped
13668920	13670920	toes wherever that means
13670920	13672920	yeah you still love me
13672920	13674920	yeah for some reason
13674920	13676920	if you lose your fingernail
13676920	13678920	it will grow back
13678920	13680920	your toenails do not have this ability
13680920	13682920	today i have learned
13682920	13684920	so i have opted
13684920	13686920	just to get it yanked off
13686920	13688920	it's coming up in a few days
13688920	13690920	i think
13690920	13692920	after my buckshot roulette
13692920	13694920	i am perfectly fine to stream
13694920	13696920	i asked i was like
13696920	13698920	my toes built different
13698920	13700920	i said is this going to put me
13700920	13702920	at a disadvantage
13702920	13704920	will i be able to
13704920	13706920	i need to be in bed rest
13706920	13708920	and they said as long as
13708920	13710920	it feels fine
13710920	13712920	i feel well
13712920	13714920	i am okay to set up
13714920	13716920	i am completely okay
13716920	13718920	to set up and stream
13718920	13720920	because i still want to stream smile
13720920	13722920	hahaha
13722920	13724920	because
13724920	13726920	if i needed bed rest
13726920	13728920	but i don't need bed rest for it
13728920	13730920	which is good for me
13730920	13732920	just means we can paint your toenails faster
13732920	13734920	honestly
13734920	13736920	should i show what it looks like
13736920	13738920	once it's healed up
13738920	13740920	they told me the healing takes a long time
13740920	13742920	so i am going to be taking
13742920	13744920	vitamins
13744920	13746920	i also have been advised
13746920	13748920	i need to go sit out in the sun for 5 minutes
13748920	13750920	to get my vitamin D up
13750920	13752920	if you didn't know your vitamin D
13752920	13754920	your scars heal faster
13754920	13756920	if winds heal fast
13756920	13758920	not a scar sorry if a wind doesn't heal fast
13758920	13760920	it becomes a scar
13760920	13762920	but i looked up some pictures
13762920	13764920	of what toes look like
13764920	13766920	that don't have a toenail
13766920	13768920	it doesn't look that gross to me
13768920	13770920	it just looks unique
13770920	13772920	and
13772920	13774920	oh no the feet lovers
13774920	13776920	are in shambles with me
13776920	13778920	i am so sorry if you are a foot lover
13778920	13780920	i recommend imibizo she is doing a foot cam stream this week
13780920	13782920	i am afraid i can no longer
13782920	13784920	take over
13784920	13786920	yeah
13786920	13788920	so
13788920	13790920	it's probably never going to get a pedicure again
13790920	13792920	i am sure that surprises no one
13792920	13794920	the funny thing was
13794920	13796920	i had looked up
13796920	13798920	stories about going and getting
13798920	13800920	pedicures done
13800920	13802920	and i was like that sounds so silly
13802920	13804920	that's never going to happen to me
13804920	13806920	the one time i go
13806920	13808920	and get my freaking toes done
13810920	13812920	but i am not mad honestly i find it
13812920	13814920	quite funny like some
13814920	13816920	people might be like oh my god how are you laughing at this
13816920	13818920	i don't know it's just funny
13818920	13820920	like i feel like your body
13820920	13822920	tells stories
13822920	13824920	and like my story
13824920	13826920	is like oh i got a pedicure done
13826920	13828920	for my reef lens and now i have
13828920	13830920	night and toenail
13830920	13832920	like i think that's a funny story
13832920	13834920	like i think that's serious like your body
13834920	13836920	is telling all these stories
13836920	13838920	of all the fun you had in your life
13838920	13840920	and i have a scar
13840920	13842920	on my boob
13842920	13844920	because
13844920	13846920	i handled a feral kitten
13846920	13848920	don't recommend ever picking up
13848920	13850920	a feral kitten but unfortunately it's an emergency situation
13850920	13852920	so i have a big scar
13852920	13854920	a little
13854920	13856920	well it's not big sorry it's a light white scar that goes
13856920	13858920	along my chest
13858920	13860920	and i just think these kind of things
13860920	13862920	are like little funny things
13862920	13864920	being like oh i remember when that happened
13864920	13866920	i burnt myself on my mum's
13866920	13868920	lamp
13868920	13870920	she had like a nightstand lamp shade thing
13870920	13872920	and i burnt myself on it and i've got a burn
13872920	13874920	on the back of my elbow
13874920	13876920	i think these are like funny kind of things
13876920	13878920	some people might be embarrassed about scars
13878920	13880920	or things going on with their body
13880920	13882920	but i'm like that's me
13882920	13884920	that's what makes me me
13884920	13886920	yeah i've got like a scar
13886920	13888920	on my knuckle
13888920	13890920	because i rode my bike
13890920	13892920	into an event

13970920	13972920	i got it assessed
13972920	13974920	and booked me in

13978920	13980920	i have not had him as a doctor
13980920	13982920	because i normally have a chick doctor

14000920	14002920	it's after the buckshot roulette stream
14002920	14004920	so after buckshot roulette
14004920	14006920	originally i was gonna do a foot cam
14006920	14008920	i'm gonna be honest i think i'm probably gonna be on an ice pack
14008920	14010920	by the time we're on buckshot roulette
14010920	14012920	i think we'll do heart cam
14012920	14014920	no we will not do heart cam
14014920	14016920	that's just my chest
14016920	14018920	we will do heart beat
14018920	14020920	i think azura has a heart beat monitor on
14020920	14022920	i was watching her play stardew
14022920	14024920	and i'm like what's 86
14024920	14026920	what's 82 what's 76
14026920	14028920	what's 81
14028920	14030920	oh my god it's her heart beat
14030920	14032920	she has a heart rate monitor on
14032920	14034920	i was like what
14034920	14036920	heart surgery cam honestly
14036920	14038920	the toe not growing back
14038920	14040920	could be different per person
14040920	14042920	woah your toe came back
14042920	14044920	aww they told me what they need to do
14044920	14046920	is like they completely
14046920	14048920	i'm not looking forward to it though
14048920	14050920	cause they said they have to do like 2 injections
14050920	14052920	and then yank your freaking nail out
14052920	14054920	which is kinda gross but hey ho
14054920	14056920	recovery
14056920	14058920	i think they said roughly 2 weeks so
14058920	14060920	if you guys really want to see it
14060920	14062920	i'll show you but
14062920	14064920	kinda gross
14064920	14066920	are you squiddling me right now
14066920	14068920	anonymous
14068920	14070920	maybe a new pedicure will fix the old one
14070920	14072920	is that not how it works
14072920	14074920	no anonymous sadly
14074920	14076920	the reason why
14076920	14078920	i had a plaster over my toe
14078920	14080920	is because
14080920	14082920	when they give you a pedicure
14082920	14084920	they cut around the skin and they cut your nail super short
14084920	14086920	because they're gonna apply
14086920	14088920	gel to it
14088920	14090920	and the girl
14090920	14092920	accidentally cut into the
14092920	14094920	side of my skin
14094920	14096920	and then cut into the nail
14096920	14098920	itself
14098920	14100920	which is why it's causing all these
14100920	14102920	problems and basically acting
14102920	14104920	infected
14104920	14106920	cause it's now growing into
14106920	14108920	my skin which sounds really gross
14108920	14110920	said it like that
14110920	14112920	but unfortunately
14112920	14114920	not happening
14114920	14116920	my poor elf able
14116920	14118920	did they say
14118920	14120920	anything about putting a chemical on it
14120920	14122920	to prevent
14122920	14124920	i think so i can't remember the full
14124920	14126920	conversation basically
14126920	14128920	the conversation was like
14128920	14130920	you've got this
14130920	14132920	what do you want to do this is what happens
14132920	14134920	if you cut the side of it it's a possibility
14134920	14136920	of coming back and cause of your nail shape
14136920	14138920	it's much more likely to happen again
14138920	14140920	or if you just get it off it's one and done
14140920	14142920	you don't have to come back
14142920	14144920	everything should be fine
14144920	14146920	i don't need antibiotics
14146920	14148920	it's not like that
14148920	14150920	it's just bad
14150920	14152920	so i
14152920	14154920	i'm just like get it over and done with
14154920	14156920	i want to be in and out i want to be back streaming
14156920	14158920	i don't want to have to like go back in
14158920	14160920	and all that
14160920	14162920	nah just take the whole thing off take off
14162920	14164920	we gotta go bald take it off we gotta go bald
14168920	14170920	thankfully because
14170920	14172920	i get to sit while i stream
14172920	14174920	as opposed to someone who's forced
14174920	14176920	to stand while they stream
14176920	14178920	question mark anyway
14178920	14180920	the healing
14180920	14182920	process isn't an issue
14182920	14184920	cause i explained i was like
14184920	14186920	i'm stronger
14186920	14188920	i don't have to be bed ridden for this
14188920	14190920	and he was like nah you're fine
14190920	14192920	if you're sitting for the full day then just sit
14192920	14194920	i need to change the bandages
14194920	14196920	though which i'm a bit
14196920	14198920	i don't know if it's gonna be gross
14198920	14200920	but i'll try my best to behave
14202920	14204920	uh
14204920	14206920	don't worry even if it doesn't grow back i don't care
14206920	14208920	yeah he's still like my
14208920	14210920	nine toenails
14210920	14212920	bandage changing
14212920	14214920	oh you're feeling brave
14214920	14216920	i think it's going to be
14216920	14218920	very
14218920	14220920	not pleasant
14222920	14224920	you'll have to wrap the top when you take a shower
14224920	14226920	i could probably take a bath easier
14226920	14228920	than a shower cause i can just like dive into the water
14228920	14230920	with my leg out of the bath
14230920	14232920	mummy streaming from the hospital bed
14232920	14234920	i probably would
14234920	14236920	i'm not even joking
14236920	14238920	i'd probably
14238920	14240920	if i was ever in a hospital for a long time
14240920	14242920	cause of whatever reason
14242920	14244920	i'd probably just buy a gaming laptop
14244920	14246920	import my model on it and be like right
14246920	14248920	that's it let's go
14248920	14250920	and then like the nurses come in
14250920	14252920	and they're like what are you doing
14252920	14254920	and i'm like oh don't worry about it
14254920	14256920	need me to chat
14256920	14258920	hospitals that's who would go hard
14258920	14260920	why
14262920	14264920	well we're almost at 7000
14264920	14266920	fishies
14266920	14268920	god we are getting through it
14268920	14270920	the question is are we going to finish the fishies
14270920	14272920	by the endurance
14272920	14274920	well you keep streaming from the shows how you
14274920	14276920	raise the nurses for real for real
14276920	14278920	why is it nurses are
14278920	14280920	so caked up for like no reason
14280920	14282920	i have a
14282920	14284920	i said i'm becoming a nurse only to
14284920	14286920	get an even larger rump
14286920	14288920	okay i'm gonna become a nurse
14288920	14290920	so i can get a larger rump
14290920	14292920	my friend
14292920	14294920	had his removed forever ago it doesn't look that different
14294920	14296920	just an indent where the nail was
14296920	14298920	okay so true nurses
14298920	14300920	have that cake
14300920	14302920	you can play old school rinscape on your phone
14302920	14304920	but i kinda stream it though
14304920	14306920	oh it's the bunny reefling
14306920	14308920	that i thought was telling me to hurt
14308920	14310920	myself because they gave me
14310920	14312920	fish food and poison
14312920	14314920	the 1002 smelly
14314920	14316920	socks in your bank
14316920	14318920	that's reeflings giving me a big
14318920	14320920	beauty
14320920	14322920	let's just say
14322920	14324920	there was no ink left
14324920	14326920	in the intent
14328920	14330920	strong it's your body your decision but
14330920	14332920	are you feeling you might regret it i couldn't
14332920	14334920	give less about
14334920	14336920	my toes i'm gonna be honest
14336920	14338920	i
14338920	14340920	don't
14340920	14342920	they don't do anything for me
14342920	14344920	i don't paint them
14344920	14346920	i'm not very feminine in terms
14346920	14348920	of getting my nails and toes done
14348920	14350920	it doesn't
14350920	14352920	affect me they told me it doesn't
14352920	14354920	affect my balance in any way
14354920	14356920	my feet will adjust very quickly
14356920	14358920	to applying pressure
14358920	14360920	while walking
14360920	14362920	i'm not trying to dismiss your thing
14362920	14364920	but the fun part is
14364920	14366920	if you put the meshy stick thing on the bed
14366920	14368920	if it comes off
14368920	14370920	yeah

14376920	14378920	into doing my nails or anything

14574920	14576920	after yourself and there's nothing you can do

14578920	14580920	it's over for you reefling
14580920	14582920	it's over before it even started
14582920	14584920	okay this is too real
14584920	14586920	but i've already been permanently affected
14586920	14588920	by you momae
14590920	14592920	i stood at attention
14592920	14594920	i turned up
14594920	14596920	reefling
14596920	14598920	time to line up it's time for your daily
14598920	14600920	inking
14600920	14602920	what hole are you going to get it's a surprise
14604920	14606920	that's terrible
14606920	14608920	why do i say these things out loud
14608920	14610920	also me when
14610920	14612920	my content gets limited
14612920	14614920	i had some curious i wonder why
14614920	14616920	hmm
14616920	14618920	thanks on you
14618920	14620920	my name's already been reefling for a week
14620920	14622920	oh wait it has
14622920	14624920	literally because you're cold reefling
14624920	14626920	i like surprises
14626920	14628920	sounds like a bit
14628920	14630920	the game is right from the start
14630920	14632920	it's inking time not yet
14634920	14636920	not yet
14636920	14638920	because we like it
14638920	14640920	the algorithm must be haunted
14640920	14642920	hmm
14642920	14644920	actually i need to
14644920	14646920	tell the girls to be careful
14646920	14648920	and say more substitute words
14648920	14650920	so if you didn't know
14650920	14652920	youtube auto caption streams
14652920	14654920	doesn't even matter for the full 12 hours
14654920	14656920	youtube auto caption it
14656920	14658920	and the problem with that is
14658920	14660920	that's why you need to do
14660920	14662920	substitute words because it will identify
14662920	14664920	the rate of things being said
14664920	14666920	and it'll be so you can swear sometimes
14666920	14668920	but if you swear too much
14668920	14670920	you're in trouble you know what i mean
14670920	14672920	so
14672920	14674920	i'll need to tell the girls to maybe do
14674920	14676920	some
14676920	14678920	i just hear a really weird noise there
14678920	14680920	is that in game
14680920	14682920	hmm
14682920	14684920	are you squidding me right now
14684920	14686920	anonymous
14692920	14694920	no
14696920	14698920	anonymous
14698920	14700920	no way
14702920	14704920	anonymous
14704920	14706920	no way you freaking assimilated
14706920	14708920	the slang
14708920	14710920	are you being saying like
14710920	14712920	are you being saying like oh i
14712920	14714920	instead of like yes
14714920	14716920	you're like mmm i can do that
14716920	14718920	oh my god we're doing it
14718920	14720920	oh and on can you
14720920	14722920	can you do this excel sheet
14722920	14724920	i can and they're all looking at you
14724920	14726920	like what
14726920	14728920	you didn't tell us you were Scottish
14728920	14730920	you're like oh oh oh
14730920	14732920	just pull the old
14732920	14734920	brian assimilation any percent
14734920	14736920	that's amazing
14738920	14740920	oh emi's
14740920	14742920	vaude is totally not going to be kept up
14742920	14744920	even after editing out
14744920	14746920	she's already on a warning
14746920	14748920	so i'm very worried about as you're in emi
14748920	14750920	at this stage
14750920	14752920	i don't want to tell the girls like hey you need to like knock
14752920	14754920	it off because that's not fun for anyone
14754920	14756920	sorry my microphone is
14756920	14758920	just playing a prank on me
14758920	14760920	they're pranking me john the Scottish accent
14760920	14762920	it's funny until it's too late
14764920	14766920	to be honest i've started typing
14766920	14768920	i a lot more
14768920	14770920	hmmm
14770920	14772920	how do warnings work
14772920	14774920	so none of the girls have a strike
14774920	14776920	on their youtube channel
14776920	14778920	but they have a warning
14778920	14780920	that lasts 90 days
14780920	14782920	3 months
14782920	14784920	so if they were to do something
14784920	14786920	against tos they get a full strike
14786920	14788920	which limits them
14788920	14790920	for a week
14790920	14792920	they can't do anything for a week
14792920	14794920	they can't upload
14794920	14796920	they can't update, they can't do this, they can't do that
14796920	14798920	and i am a bit
14798920	14800920	nervous
14800920	14802920	but as soon as the warning expires
14802920	14804920	at the 90 day mark
14804920	14806920	i think
14806920	14808920	all is good at that but what the heck
14808920	14810920	is that
14810920	14812920	what the hell
14812920	14814920	oh my
14814920	14816920	there's no way
14816920	14818920	way
14818920	14820920	hold on big ass he's right
14822920	14824920	it's not
14824920	14826920	messed up because
14826920	14828920	it gives a warning
14828920	14830920	and not a strike
14830920	14832920	but the length
14832920	14834920	being 90 days is pretty rough
14834920	14836920	i have to admit considering
14836920	14838920	youtube haven't announced their new
14838920	14840920	updated tos or their stealth
14840920	14842920	tos wherever you want to call it at this rate
14842920	14844920	um
14844920	14846920	it's a bit messed up because
14846920	14848920	they've updated it but because they gave
14848920	14850920	a warning
14850920	14852920	if they gave a strike then yes i would agree
14852920	14854920	and say that's really not fair
14854920	14856920	because you've not
14856920	14858920	you've yet to say that ASMR ear licking
14858920	14860920	is against the rules yet even though
14860920	14862920	you're applying it
14862920	14864920	um
14864920	14866920	type thing
14866920	14868920	but yeah so i have to confess
14868920	14870920	i've reached 90 cooking 3 times
14870920	14872920	before this stream you cannot have
14872920	14874920	i only started like a week ago
14876920	14878920	you can't you mean
14878920	14880920	before though like before
14880920	14882920	you can't have done 99
14882920	14884920	because that's like
14884920	14886920	they say it tastes like 81
14886920	14888920	hours to do 99 or something
14888920	14890920	oh azura got a warning
14890920	14892920	for eating a cookie unfortunately yes
14892920	14894920	like azura
14894920	14896920	i don't know what's going on with azura
14896920	14898920	she wanted to do
14898920	14900920	an exercise ASMR stream
14900920	14902920	and unfortunately
14902920	14904920	management was like
14904920	14906920	bruv you're gonna get a strike for that
14906920	14908920	you literally got in trouble
14908920	14910920	for eating a cookie
14910920	14912920	what makes you think you can do heavy breathing ASMR
14912920	14914920	working out
14914920	14916920	and it's such a shame because i never want to say
14916920	14918920	no to the girls
14918920	14920920	but
14920920	14922920	i don't want to risk her money like her income
14922920	14924920	i know she's not monetized yet but she's about to be
14924920	14926920	i do not want to risk her monetization
14926920	14928920	and
14928920	14930920	like if she wanted to
14930920	14932920	record it and upload it
14932920	14934920	like on twitter that's fine
14934920	14936920	i have no issues with that
14936920	14938920	the cookie embargo honestly
14938920	14940920	yeah the sounds youtube sucks
14940920	14942920	and
14942920	14944920	yeah she wanted to do work out ASMR
14944920	14946920	but that would result in like heavy breathing
14946920	14948920	in the mic and
14948920	14950920	i don't know what is going on at youtube
14950920	14952920	headquarters but it is
14952920	14954920	absolutely
14954920	14956920	going to the dogs
14956920	14958920	i wish they would just come out and see what is and what isn't
14958920	14960920	instead of playing this weird
14960920	14962920	guessing game of like oh
14962920	14964920	but that's fine oh but that's not
14964920	14966920	fine
14972920	14974920	oh my god
14974920	14976920	but yeah the
14976920	14978920	very curious very curious
14978920	14980920	well i got a thousand
14980920	14982920	likes on that ASMR video hold on
14982920	14984920	in the money
14984920	14986920	you may not
14986920	14988920	have a cookie youtube literally
14988920	14990920	i think
14990920	14992920	because azura's voice is so
14992920	14994920	silky perfection and sex
14994920	14996920	who is why she got walloped
14996920	14998920	with it which is a shame because it's not fair
14998920	15000920	that's not fair at all
15000920	15002920	and because that is just her voice
15002920	15004920	i i'll tell
15004920	15006920	you something in the interview
15006920	15008920	with her i thought she was
15008920	15010920	putting it on and she was going to like
15010920	15012920	reveal her voice to me in the interview
15012920	15014920	no that's just her voice she's just
15014920	15016920	straight up a goddess
15016920	15018920	no questions asked
15018920	15020920	hmm
15020920	15022920	purple burglar
15022920	15024920	you're the second one
15024920	15026920	you're the second one i see you
15026920	15028920	see you taking it
15028920	15030920	um literally
15030920	15032920	punished her for her default voice
15032920	15034920	i thought literally there was a lot of
15034920	15036920	actually there was a really interesting thing about the
15036920	15038920	introduce yourself videos
15038920	15040920	a lot of people did their
15040920	15042920	character voice that they currently
15042920	15044920	like do as a vtuber and then they were like
15044920	15046920	hi viewer
15046920	15048920	in their actual voice
15048920	15050920	and it was quite interesting
15050920	15052920	it was nice seeing the swap
15052920	15054920	and i was convinced i was like oh azura is like
15054920	15056920	yeah putting on a voice and i did the
15056920	15058920	interview and i was like oh
15058920	15060920	i didn't even know people had goddess voices
15060920	15062920	like this um
15062920	15064920	do you know how much money i would make with your voice
15064920	15066920	yes thank you give it to me now
15066920	15068920	i literally i was like if i could grab
15068920	15070920	all the girls voices
15070920	15072920	you guys seen
15072920	15074920	that movie with a mermaid in it
15074920	15076920	where her voice gets stolen
15076920	15078920	oh it's called the little mermaid yeah
15078920	15080920	her voice gets stolen she's like
15082920	15084920	me she did 40 push ups
15084920	15086920	yesterday and the noise is
15090920	15092920	your voice is
15092920	15094920	okay you like that right
15094920	15096920	lads time for a group session
15096920	15098920	get your tentacle out
15098920	15100920	and then get your lotion
15100920	15102920	and have a wee go at your tentacle
15102920	15104920	and then once you're ready you'll ink
15104920	15106920	everywhere thank you lads
15106920	15108920	that's literally how i thought
15108920	15110920	my demo recording went
15110920	15112920	it was absolutely awful
15112920	15114920	who's stunting on us with these lava
15114920	15116920	capes
15118920	15120920	vivi pronouncing it below
15120920	15122920	still sends me
15122920	15124920	it's adorable
15128920	15130920	i literally if i could steal the girls
15130920	15132920	voices it would be over for everyone
15132920	15134920	unanimously at once
15134920	15136920	i could do lollipop i could do
15136920	15138920	milk i could do me
15138920	15140920	i could do yandere
15140920	15142920	you know but i can't
15144920	15146920	but that's okay
15146920	15148920	because sometimes i can go
15148920	15150920	but the only way i can do this
15150920	15152920	is by closing my mouth basically
15156920	15158920	would you still watch me if i was a lollipop
15158920	15160920	beecher burn sounded like that

15174920	15176920	your family this dude
15176920	15178920	can't get rid of me
15178920	15180920	yeah

15182920	15184920	we're gonna
15184920	15186920	get the swordfish
15186920	15188920	that we're burning
15188920	15190920	i don't even want to

16236920	16238920	do not feel a shred
16238920	16240920	of it multi-generational
16240920	16242920	living was incredibly
16242920	16244920	common for
16244920	16246920	centuries
16246920	16248920	way before capitalism came
16248920	16250920	into the picture do not be
16250920	16252920	embarrassed about living with your
16252920	16254920	more living with your grand

16256920	16258920	is beautiful to even have that

16262920	16264920	of multi-generational households
16264920	16266920	I would absolutely love to
16266920	16268920	see the uprising of
16268920	16270920	people going back to farming
16270920	16272920	another thing in
16272920	16274920	World War I and World War II
16276920	16278920	people on mass
16278920	16280920	were instructed
16280920	16282920	on how to grow vegetables
16282920	16284920	at home with the rise
16284920	16286920	of supermarkets capitalism
16286920	16288920	who here
16288920	16290920	knows someone who grows
16290920	16292920	produce themselves
16292920	16294920	I know no one
16294920	16296920	I know no one
16296920	16298920	that grows produce themselves
16298920	16300920	because of how
16300920	16302920	how much lack of time
16302920	16304920	people have maybe
16304920	16306920	your grand may do it
16306920	16308920	because she has time because she is retired
16308920	16310920	did you know how common it was
16310920	16312920	to have a farm
16312920	16314920	to have farm animals
16314920	16316920	such as chickens how common it was
16316920	16318920	to grow even the most
16318920	16320920	basic of vegetable such as
16320920	16322920	potatoes such as tomatoes
16322920	16324920	such as peas

16336920	16338920	are getting for houses

16390920	16392920	okay let's clip it to my head
16392920	16394920	hold on you feel like
16394920	16396920	right and while I'm at it
16396920	16398920	sorry I just jumped up there in excitement
16398920	16400920	and while I'm at it
16400920	16402920	hmm
16402920	16404920	isn't it curious that garden
16404920	16406920	spaces for the average house
16406920	16408920	have been lessening and lessening
16408920	16410920	every year I wonder
16410920	16412920	do they want the people
16412920	16414920	not to have the ability to grow
16414920	16416920	produce in the means of their
16416920	16418920	own production for survival
16418920	16420920	hmmm
16420920	16422920	isn't that curious
16422920	16424920	isn't that curious that flats
16424920	16426920	massive sky scraping building blocks
16426920	16428920	have no garden space
16428920	16430920	so people cannot produce their own
16430920	16432920	produce their own vegetables
16432920	16434920	their own fruits their own herbs
16434920	16436920	so people are forced to
16436920	16438920	rely on supermarkets
16438920	16440920	yet again
16440920	16442920	capitalism strikes
16442920	16444920	isn't that curious
16444920	16446920	I find that so curious
16446920	16448920	at this day and age
16448920	16450920	with all these
16450920	16452920	advancements on building so many houses
16452920	16454920	the garden spaces are getting so tiny
16454920	16456920	you cannot even have a produce
16456920	16458920	producing tree and isn't it curious
16458920	16460920	that even when there are
16460920	16462920	fruit producing trees
16462920	16464920	that
16464920	16466920	they purposely don't have
16466920	16468920	fruit producing trees when they have to put trees down
16468920	16470920	instead they use pollen trees
16470920	16472920	which are good
16472920	16474920	I don't get me wrong they're good for the bugs
16474920	16476920	but they never give free
16476920	16478920	produce producing trees
16478920	16480920	I fucking saw a story where someone
16480920	16482920	got given lemons from
16482920	16484920	the garden and she didn't know that you could
16484920	16486920	just straight up cut the lemon open
16486920	16488920	and add it to the juice they thought it had to be
16488920	16490920	produce isn't it interesting
16490920	16492920	that in school you hardly
16492920	16494920	learn about the cycle of the farmers
16494920	16496920	and how you never are encouraged
16496920	16498920	to go to farmers markets
16498920	16500920	instead of the big fricking Tescos
16500920	16502920	or big as their big this or big that
16502920	16504920	talk your shit
16504920	16506920	damn straight I'll talk my shit
16506920	16508920	isn't that interesting
16508920	16510920	that you hardly even learn about seeds
16510920	16512920	seeds I will tell you
16512920	16514920	about seeds right now
16514920	16516920	to remember the three threat factors
16516920	16518920	of growing seeds it's what
16518920	16520920	W-O-T
16520920	16522920	water, oxygen, temperature
16522920	16524920	that is how you grow seeds
16526920	16528920	the other part of the fun is when
16528920	16530920	Monsanto tries to sue people for using their seeds
16530920	16532920	and another thing
16532920	16534920	there's states where you can't even collect
16534920	16536920	rainwater it is illegal to collect
16536920	16538920	rainwater what would you use
16538920	16540920	for rainwater hmm
16540920	16542920	you would water your own crops
16542920	16544920	with rainwater
16544920	16546920	bruv this
16546920	16548920	system is
16548920	16550920	fuck
16550920	16552920	it's beyond bull
16554920	16556920	don't look too deep into it
16556920	16558920	or you're not going to enjoy what you see
16558920	16560920	you have to look around
16560920	16562920	and say we live in a society
16562920	16564920	that's all we can do
16564920	16566920	Reeflings
16566920	16568920	we live in a society
16568920	16570920	amen
16570920	16572920	okay I'm going to get off my soap box
16572920	16574920	for a minute there
16574920	16576920	let me remove this asset
16576920	16578920	let me remove my tin foil hat
16578920	16580920	but don't think I won't put that hat back on
16580920	16582920	hold on actually
16582920	16584920	I have this hat
16584920	16586920	okay
16586920	16588920	we can put this hat on we're back to meman
16590920	16592920	okay it's a bit wonky but
16592920	16594920	it's really wonky
16594920	16596920	right above calm down we live
16596920	16598920	in a society
16598920	16600920	ooh
16600920	16602920	thank you for letting me rant about that
16602920	16604920	but it makes you think
16604920	16606920	it's illegal to collect rainwater
16606920	16608920	yes
16608920	16610920	but is that because
16610920	16612920	it might drinking water might be contaminated
16612920	16614920	why do you think that's contaminated
16614920	16616920	is it because these mega
16616920	16618920	corporations bribe
16618920	16620920	their way
16620920	16622920	into being allowed to pollute the waters
16622920	16624920	did you know in the UK
16624920	16626920	there is no
16626920	16628920	swimmable rivers
16628920	16630920	that are not toxic
16630920	16632920	for they are all actively
16632920	16634920	being polluted in
16634920	16636920	hmm did you know that
16636920	16638920	all in the name of what
16638920	16640920	reeflings
16640920	16642920	capitalism
16642920	16644920	shocking behavior
16644920	16646920	sorry I took my tin foil hat off
16646920	16648920	zero
16648920	16650920	yes zero
16652920	16654920	by the way I also have a friend who has like
16654920	16656920	20 different crops growing in his basement
16656920	16658920	so a garden is technically not needed
16658920	16660920	and that
16660920	16662920	should that gentleman be having those crops
16662920	16664920	right
16664920	16666920	I'll get, ooh pardon me
16666920	16668920	I'll get off my high horse
16668920	16670920	I think I may need to eat for I haven't eaten anything at all to do
16670920	16672920	in fact I've only had a cup of tea
16672920	16674920	and a half bottle of water
16674920	16676920	it's not looking good for me
16676920	16678920	so yes
16678920	16680920	I will do
16680920	16682920	another batch
16682920	16684920	so when strongies farm
16684920	16686920	airing on BBC
16686920	16688920	oh they'd never let me air it I'd be going nuts
16688920	16690920	yeah actually
16690920	16692920	we'll go back for it a little bit it's not too tin foil hat
16692920	16694920	during world war one and world war two
16694920	16696920	where food scarcity was a thing
16696920	16698920	in the modern day age food scarcity
16698920	16700920	is not a thing please do not be under the impression
16700920	16702920	scarcity is a lie
16702920	16704920	food
16704920	16706920	scarcity was a thing
16706920	16708920	so people were encouraged to grow
16708920	16710920	farms to do very unique
16710920	16712920	plots to do
16712920	16714920	legumes to do potatoes to do
16714920	16716920	the most staple foods you can imagine
16716920	16718920	and with the uprising
16718920	16720920	of supermarkets people stopped doing it
16720920	16722920	and who benefits
16722920	16724920	who benefits
16724920	16726920	when we
16726920	16728920	the individuals the small
16728920	16730920	communities no longer grow
16730920	16732920	our own crops no longer
16732920	16734920	have thingy
16734920	16736920	we are fully reliant
16736920	16738920	on the system
16738920	16740920	which is not good
16740920	16742920	you never want to fully rely on the system
16742920	16744920	but guess what if you don't want to
16744920	16746920	rely on the system what do you need
16746920	16748920	oh well you need a plot of land to grow
16748920	16750920	okay and you need time
16750920	16752920	but wait a minute even if I
16752920	16754920	fully outright buy my
16754920	16756920	plot of land wait a minute
16756920	16758920	I still have to play some
16758920	16760920	to pay some sort of yearly
16760920	16762920	land tax
16762920	16764920	towards
16764920	16766920	the place that I'm living in
16766920	16768920	because there is no place that is truly free
16768920	16770920	you can you buy
16770920	16772920	a house in UK and every year
16772920	16774920	you pay council tax
16774920	16776920	even if you don't participate in the services
16776920	16778920	that they provide
16778920	16780920	you do it in Australia they have a thing
16780920	16782920	called land tax in America
16782920	16784920	they have a thing called something tax
16784920	16786920	even when you
16786920	16788920	want to fully
16788920	16790920	no longer be a part of the system
16790920	16792920	they already got you
16792920	16794920	hook, line and sinker
16794920	16796920	and it doesn't matter what you do
16796920	16798920	you can't escape it anyway that's me
16798920	16800920	property ownership tax yet
16800920	16802920	farmers are struggling
16802920	16804920	yep so
16804920	16806920	em
16806920	16808920	every time
16808920	16810920	there is a shortage
16812920	16814920	in Australia recently
16814920	16816920	this happened a couple of months back now though
16816920	16818920	there was a shortages of eggs
16818920	16820920	and the prices went up
16820920	16822920	because there was a shortage of course that makes sense
16822920	16824920	so more people are wanting eggs
16824920	16826920	but there's less eggs ah hold on a minute
16826920	16828920	what's going on here we're in the information age
16828920	16830920	a major
16830920	16832920	em
16832920	16834920	a major
16834920	16836920	major egg producer
16836920	16838920	in Australia came out and said
16838920	16840920	em actually
16840920	16842920	there's nothing wrong with production at all
16842920	16844920	if you want to know the truth
16844920	16846920	they're actually not giving us
16846920	16848920	as much money as they used to
16848920	16850920	yet the prices are going up
16850920	16852920	and we don't get to see any of that benefit
16852920	16854920	are you telling me
16854920	16856920	these mega corporations
16856920	16858920	are artificially
16858920	16860920	hold on
16860920	16862920	are you telling me
16862920	16864920	these mega corporations
16864920	16866920	wait how is there two
16866920	16868920	how did I do that hold on a minute
16868920	16870920	I need to put my tinfoil hat back on
16870920	16872920	no
16872920	16874920	it can't be
16874920	16876920	that all these mega corporations
16876920	16878920	are actually hand in hand with one another
16878920	16880920	no
16880920	16882920	wait
16882920	16884920	the cost of living crisis
16884920	16886920	is actually artificial
16886920	16888920	because if one shop
16888920	16890920	raises their prices
16890920	16892920	the other shop can justify that
16892920	16894920	but then the major
16894920	16896920	no that can't be right because
16896920	16898920	capitalism obviously
16898920	16900920	what the frick is that
16900920	16902920	that's very grand sitting on that table
16902920	16904920	but then oh no that can't be right
16904920	16906920	no
16906920	16908920	the good businesses aren't
16908920	16910920	wait a minute
16910920	16912920	Coca Cola owns
16912920	16914920	all of the market
16914920	16916920	wait
16916920	16918920	but I thought capitalism
16918920	16920920	bred competition
16920920	16922920	no no everything I've been told
16922920	16924920	that's not right
16924920	16926920	wait a minute
16926920	16928920	something's not adding up
16928920	16930920	Coca Cola seems to own
16930920	16932920	literally everything
16932920	16934920	wait a minute who is the sole business owner
16934920	16936920	because everything seems
16936920	16938920	to be getting acquired
16938920	16940920	wait
16940920	16942920	wait a minute it's a conglomerate
16942920	16944920	everything is a
16944920	16946920	fucking conglomerate
16946920	16948920	and they can put up the prices as much as they please
16948920	16950920	because there's no true
16950920	16952920	competition
16952920	16954920	even if there were cheaper
16954920	16956920	brands that wanted to get on the shelves
16956920	16958920	brands have to pay
16958920	16960920	to be on the shelves in your common
16960920	16962920	supermarkets
16962920	16964920	holy moly
16964920	16966920	my head
16966920	16968920	spinning just thinking about
16968920	16970920	how deep this rabbit hole goes
16970920	16972920	maybe
16972920	16974920	we should focus on the one rabbit hole
16974920	16976920	that's important to us
16976920	16978920	and that's Sheeby's hole
16978920	16980920	we love you Sheeby we hope you feel better
16980920	16982920	after your migraine

17564920	17566920	of the casing
17566920	17568920	I don't know if you can hear that
17568920	17570920	um
17570920	17572920	but that is pretty much
17572920	17574920	what's going on
17578920	17580920	I really remember
17580920	17582920	moving to my head to express
17583920	17585920	she came back she loves this
17585920	17587920	of course I do
17587920	17589920	remember that time I thought I wasn't going to come back
17589920	17591920	that was rough
17591920	17593920	that was rough and then I come back
17593920	17595920	come back even stronger
17595920	17597920	yes I
17597920	17599920	for endurance streams
17599920	17601920	it's not possible
17601920	17603920	for me to prepare food
17604920	17606920	unless I did it in advance but I am a lazy fud
17606920	17608920	um so
17608920	17610920	I have bought like a load of
17610920	17612920	drive food or food that
17612920	17614920	is zero prep time
17614920	17616920	I don't have any boiled eggs
17616920	17618920	I ate all my boiled eggs
17618920	17620920	and my meat sticks have kind of
17620920	17622920	overstayed their welcome
17622920	17624920	no no no no no no
17624920	17626920	I am going to take a bite of my muffin though
17626920	17628920	I did not realise
17628920	17630920	I had been streaming for five hours
17630920	17632920	I literally had nothing but a cup of tea
17632920	17634920	and a half bottle of water that's outrageous
17634920	17636920	that's how distracted you guys get me
17636920	17638920	that's how much I freaking love it
17638920	17640920	um
17640920	17642920	oh my goodness but yes
17642920	17644920	I am going to take a bite of my muffin
17644920	17646920	I do apologise if I am not
17646920	17648920	talking for a few moments
17648920	17650920	but I eat my muffin
17650920	17652920	itadakimasu

17666920	17668920	I can't believe it
17668920	17670920	I can't believe
17670920	17672920	we really enjoy each other's company
17672920	17674920	it's crazy it's a crazy concept
17674920	17676920	honestly couldn't imagine being a VTuber
17676920	17678920	that hates our audience like bro
17680920	17682920	why are you even streaming
17682920	17684920	cause I am pretty sure I have heard a few
17684920	17686920	sent stories like that
17686920	17688920	where they are like oh I hate what I do
17688920	17690920	I am like what if you hate what you do
17690920	17692920	like
17692920	17694920	go clock out and do something else
17694920	17696920	what the fuck
17696920	17698920	how can you not enjoy your time
17698920	17700920	actually
17700920	17702920	well I am on my high horse about VTubers now
17702920	17704920	how can you not enjoy your time
17704920	17706920	you dictated everything you get to do
17706920	17708920	you don't have to do a single thing
17708920	17710920	if you want to play game play game
17710920	17712920	if you don't want to play game don't play game
17712920	17714920	you want to zazoo zazoo
17714920	17716920	you don't want to zazoo don't zazoo
17716920	17718920	wait a minute what's going on
17718920	17720920	nah I refuse to believe there is any VTubers that stream
17720920	17722920	that actually don't like streaming
17722920	17724920	they don't like everything
17724920	17726920	it doesn't make sense
17726920	17728920	the Elden Ring
17728920	17730920	DLC comes out
17730920	17732920	and I get to do nothing

17734920	17736920	for again what half a week
17736920	17738920	maybe more actually maybe 5 sessions
17738920	17740920	I have no idea how big the DLC is
17740920	17742920	I don't even know
17742920	17744920	if they have given an indication on how big
17744920	17746920	the DLC is
17748920	17750920	I just want money for existing proof
17750920	17752920	and another thing about capital
17752920	17754920	I'll stop
17754920	17756920	no more hi-hat
17756920	17758920	no more tinfoil for now
17758920	17760920	I will burn you out on my conspiracy theories
17760920	17762920	T-
17762920	17764920	1 hour I believe
17764920	17766920	for our lovely
17768920	17770920	the goddess
17770920	17772920	of fertility
17772920	17774920	or mummy
17774920	17776920	she is your mummy canonically
17776920	17778920	she is quite literally your mum
17780920	17782920	nah
17782920	17784920	it was enough to be nearly a full game
17784920	17786920	ok might need to change up my plan
17786920	17788920	for the 4th week
17788920	17790920	do you want to hold it strongy
17790920	17792920	the DLC

17794920	17796920	ok if it's like
17796920	17798920	wait are we going to do a full week of Elden Ring then
17802920	17804920	if we do a full week of Elden Ring
17804920	17806920	on the 4th week
17806920	17808920	I will make up for any membership
17808920	17810920	content like I will literally do

17828920	17830920	villager minecraft note
17830920	17832920	Elden Ring DLC I sleep
17832920	17834920	let's see
17834920	17836920	hmm
17836920	17838920	oh I tell you what
17838920	17840920	I was doing my research on a game that I might play
17840920	17842920	it's called
17842920	17844920	Boutro
17844920	17846920	it is a poker
17846920	17848920	type game
17848920	17850920	and unfortunately
17850920	17852920	I'm not very familiar with the old
17852920	17854920	straight flush flush royal flush
17854920	17856920	or whatever the only flush I do
17856920	17858920	is after I drop a big job in the toilet
17858920	17860920	and
17860920	17862920	I was
17862920	17864920	it looks pretty easy to play
17864920	17866920	in terms of me actually being good
17866920	17868920	that's a different story however
17868920	17870920	it looked like a can
17870920	17872920	to our game experience
17872920	17874920	so I was doing my research
17874920	17876920	I was watching people play it and I'm like
17876920	17878920	hmm yes I understand none of this
17878920	17880920	so I'm going to look at a few more tutorials
17880920	17882920	but we might give Boutro a little try
17882920	17884920	I'll be one of my shorter streams
17884920	17886920	hmm
17886920	17888920	not the new tinkle
17888920	17890920	the guys whenever you
17890920	17892920	poop do you always pee as well
17894920	17896920	I think it's the same for guys
17896920	17898920	I do know a secret though
17898920	17900920	if you move your fireman's
17900920	17902920	hose
17902920	17904920	your butthole clenches
17904920	17906920	I've never been the same
17906920	17908920	since I learned that fact on the internet
17908920	17910920	the internet has scarred me for that fact
17910920	17912920	it's there
17912920	17914920	see you're all twitching
17914920	17916920	your buttholes right now I can tell
17916920	17918920	reeflings
17918920	17920920	can't believe you're doing it in unison
17920920	17922920	okay
17922920	17924920	I have finished
17924920	17926920	my mini muffin
17926920	17928920	I'm going to open up my cola
17928920	17930920	to wash it down
17930920	17932920	hmm
17932920	17934920	honestly I was worried about eating on stream
17934920	17936920	but it's really easy to eat and play runeski
17936920	17938920	at the same time
17938920	17940920	a twitch butthole for a moment
17940920	17942920	reeflings together
17942920	17944920	strong
17944920	17946920	we can also manually twitch your fireman's hose
17946920	17948920	but can you do it without
17948920	17950920	twitching the butthole
17950920	17952920	no you can't apparently it's guys
17952920	17954920	biology that you can't
17962920	17964920	wah
17964920	17966920	bit cola
17966920	17968920	man by the pope
17968920	17970920	wait wait wait hold on a minute who's calling me hypocritical
17970920	17972920	cause I just talked about corporations
17972920	17974920	and then I'm currently eating and drinking cola
17974920	17976920	me
17976920	17978920	as if I can source this stuff myself in the wild
17980920	17982920	who else is going to give me my sugary nectar
17986920	17988920	I'm currently open my nature valley
17988920	17990920	I have a bowl to eat it in
17990920	17992920	because I just know it's going to go
17992920	17994920	everywhere
17994920	17996920	and
17996920	17998920	we're almost at a million eggs
17998920	18000920	wah

18014920	18016920	I think he just sniped that little thing there
18018920	18020920	I'd like to check out mommy's nature valley
18020920	18022920	I thought a certain type of
18022920	18024920	exercise could give you that kind of
18024920	18026920	control over the muscles
18026920	18028920	do you guys want to do kegels together
18028920	18030920	and hold
18030920	18032920	2, 3 and release
18032920	18034920	2, 3 and hold 2, 3
18034920	18036920	that's terrible
18036920	18038920	don't encourage me
18038920	18040920	don't get me started

18054920	18056920	and I just grabbed one
18056920	18058920	because I had to tinkle and it just

18142920	18144920	with me on RuneScape alone
18148920	18150920	someone's dropping them
18150920	18152920	why would they do that

18722920	18724920	dripping off the thing
18724920	18726920	they could have like blotted it
18726920	18728920	or patted it or whatever but they don't
18730920	18732920	a cheeky little treat perhaps
18732920	18734920	I'm bringing you all with me

18746920	18748920	XP in order to summon her brother
18748920	18750920	back it's look whatever she does
18750920	18752920	as long as we can look the other way
18752920	18754920	the fact she's not actually now that I mentioned
18754920	18756920	the fact she's not even in jail
18756920	18758920	how would she be evading jail
18758920	18760920	when she just used her magic on people
18760920	18762920	who'd try and stop her
18762920	18764920	or maybe she has like influential magic
18764920	18766920	I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised
18766920	18768920	if she had like turned the other eye type
18768920	18770920	of spells and
18770920	18772920	where it was like oh must have been the wind
18772920	18774920	and I wouldn't be surprised
18774920	18776920	if she had access to that
18776920	18778920	and her wee totems
18782920	18784920	high charisma, yeah
18786920	18788920	she has to rescue Nissan from the devil
18788920	18790920	herself
18790920	18792920	like Maggie Thatcher
18792920	18794920	I think people were so confused
18794920	18796920	they were like why the devil herself
18796920	18798920	and then Maggie Thatcher and as a surprise
18798920	18800920	there was a Scottish person
18800920	18802920	on the development team and we thought the gag
18802920	18804920	was hilarious so
18804920	18806920	there you go
18808920	18810920	wow

18856920	18858920	and I was like what did I make that was funny
18858920	18860920	I forgot
18866920	18868920	crying fish and chips for my
18874920	18876920	so do you want to hear the
18876920	18878920	saddest story in all the land
18878920	18880920	I really like Mexican food
18880920	18882920	you know what I don't like
18882920	18884920	cilantro
18884920	18886920	and that stuff tastes awful
18886920	18888920	do you want to know what
18888920	18890920	cilantro
18890920	18892920	is primarily used in
18892920	18894920	that's right
18894920	18896920	Mexican cooking
18896920	18898920	man I
18898920	18900920	hated here
18900920	18902920	it tastes awful to me
18902920	18904920	absolutely awful
18904920	18906920	I tried a
18906920	18908920	I tried a
18908920	18910920	rice wrap I think it was
18910920	18912920	Vietnamese inspired rice wrap
18912920	18914920	no rice cake
18914920	18916920	with chicken in it
18916920	18918920	and it sounded so good and I took a bite
18918920	18920920	and I was like
18922920	18924920	in Australia
18924920	18926920	there's a lot more
18926920	18928920	access to Asian foods
18928920	18930920	that are authentic or really good type thing
18930920	18932920	which is why I'm currently
18932920	18934920	addicted to local Chinese
18938920	18940920	I've been adventurous
18940920	18942920	I'll try this I'll try that
18942920	18944920	and I couldn't figure out why I hated it
18944920	18946920	until I finally figured out
18946920	18948920	it's cilantro I can't handle
18948920	18950920	cilantro it tastes nasty
18950920	18952920	I'm so sorry
18952920	18954920	I apologize to those
18954920	18956920	who have
18956920	18958920	who do enjoy cilantro
18958920	18960920	yes I have the soap gene
18960920	18962920	I cannot even describe to you how nasty
18962920	18964920	and completely
18964920	18966920	ruins in any trace of it
18966920	18968920	in the food completely ruins the food as well
18968920	18970920	it is a
18970920	18972920	unlucky and unfun gene
18972920	18974920	to have
18974920	18976920	isn't it genetic

18978920	18980920	my dad
18980920	18982920	I think eats it fine
18982920	18984920	because one time
18984920	18986920	he made like is it
18986920	18988920	Pico de Mayo or something
18988920	18990920	I'm so sorry I think I butchered that
18990920	18992920	he made it and I tasted it
18992920	18994920	and I was like this is nasty
18994920	18996920	but I never said that to him I just said
18996920	18998920	oh I don't think my taste buds agree with that
18998920	19000920	I never said anything but it's because of the cilantro
19000920	19002920	in it
19002920	19004920	Pico de Gallo
19004920	19006920	okay sorry
19006920	19008920	Pico de Gallo
19008920	19010920	yes I think my dad tried to make some of it at home

19030920	19032920	where's the yellow thing
19032920	19034920	oh that reminds me of it
19034920	19036920	we need to do a watch along
19036920	19038920	of Kevin Bridges
19038920	19040920	um
19040920	19042920	Kevin Bridges
19042920	19044920	is a Scottish comedian you might know
19044920	19046920	someone called Frankie Boyle
19046920	19048920	or what's the other Scottish
19048920	19050920	comedian's name and I've forgotten his name
19050920	19052920	and he's got Parkinson's right now
19052920	19054920	but he's still alive I'm pretty sure
19056920	19058920	and he's got a beard and kind of
19058920	19060920	big
19060920	19062920	not curly hair but wavy hair
19062920	19064920	and he's older
19064920	19066920	oh my god what's his name
19068920	19070920	Billy Conley oh
19070920	19072920	Billy Conley
19072920	19074920	it took me so long to get there
19074920	19076920	holy crap Billy Conley
19076920	19078920	hold on I need to drink my tea before I get sick
19078920	19080920	mhm
19080920	19082920	mhm
19082920	19084920	mhm
19084920	19086920	so I put far too much
19086920	19088920	honey in my first team and I put far too much
19088920	19090920	little I can never find the balance
19090920	19092920	Billy Conley
19092920	19094920	is like real Scots I'm gonna do
19094920	19096920	watch alongs of like
19096920	19098920	Scottish comedy so
19098920	19100920	you guys can laugh and I can be like
19100920	19102920	why are the reeflings running in an X pattern
19102920	19104920	so they are
19104920	19106920	assigned each other to follow each other
19106920	19108920	which is causing this four way
19108920	19110920	oh my god what are you doing over there
19114920	19116920	so they're not actually clicking anymore
19116920	19118920	their characters are following
19118920	19120920	each other which is causing an infinite loop
19120920	19122920	which is pretty cool
19124920	19126920	wait you don't pronounce the second
19126920	19128920	Billy Conley
19128920	19130920	oh Billy Conley sorry
19130920	19132920	Billy Conley I'm not good with names
19132920	19134920	so don't expect any
19134920	19136920	don't expect a miracle with me ok
19136920	19138920	it's a scrawny summoning ritual
19138920	19140920	down with black rock
19144920	19146920	I love Kevin Bridges
19146920	19148920	my brother served him at a local club
19148920	19150920	he lives close to me oh that's amazing
19150920	19152920	I really enjoy Kevin Bridges humour
19152920	19154920	because it's quite
19154920	19156920	deadpan like British
19156920	19158920	humour is quite deadpan so
19158920	19160920	we'll probably do a watch
19160920	19162920	hey you're getting sturdy with it
19162920	19164920	hold on hold on hold on let me just
19164920	19166920	get the fish out of the bank first
19166920	19168920	hey reefling getting sturdy with it
19174920	19176920	I love all these emotes in the game
19176920	19178920	I haven't unlocked any more but
19178920	19180920	other than the default ones
19182920	19184920	this stomped on raught route
19184920	19186920	really sells me on the cult vibes
19186920	19188920	oh she be playing cult of the lamb
19188920	19190920	did she finish it yet
19190920	19192920	I think she was so close to finishing it
19192920	19194920	at last on you but maybe she did it
19198920	19200920	hydration
19202920	19204920	gears are quid
19204920	19206920	you're getting stabbed is a great one
19206920	19208920	it is oh my god
19208920	19210920	oh fat boy
19210920	19212920	I know this makes no
19212920	19214920	I'm gonna tell Kevin Bridges
19214920	19216920	his joke ok
19216920	19218920	so Kevin Bridges is
19218920	19220920	a man and he's quite large in size
19220920	19222920	I think he's lost a weight since or whatever
19222920	19224920	but he said he was like 25 stone
19224920	19226920	or something which is big
19226920	19228920	and he was telling the story
19228920	19230920	where he's out late at night
19230920	19232920	waiting on the bus
19232920	19234920	and some net comes up and goes
19234920	19236920	oh fat boy
19236920	19238920	gears are quid or you're getting stabbed
19238920	19240920	and then he's like
19240920	19242920	so I start calculating my BMI
19242920	19244920	with the other people around me
19244920	19246920	type thing
19246920	19248920	and this retains that it's him
19248920	19250920	that's been picked on by this person
19252920	19254920	and he's like in order
19254920	19256920	to avoid this heinous act
19256920	19258920	against me
19258920	19260920	for the mere price of a quid
19260920	19262920	I think that's a pretty good bargain
19262920	19264920	so he did not get stabbed that night
19266920	19268920	that's the best I can do for telling the joke
19268920	19270920	but it's a really good joke
19270920	19272920	I'll get us to do a watch along
19272920	19274920	Kevin Bridges
19274920	19276920	he's a local co-op
19276920	19278920	I know I'm going to play with sheebie
19278920	19280920	and we'll force her to play with me
19280920	19282920	he used to weigh about 350 pounds
19282920	19284920	woo
19284920	19286920	oh isn't there
19286920	19288920	there's an American place that lets you eat for free
19288920	19290920	um
19290920	19292920	if you're over like
19292920	19294920	heart attack grill oh my god I'm so sorry
19294920	19296920	I look at videos of heart attack grill
19296920	19298920	I think it's so fascinating
19298920	19300920	um
19300920	19302920	there's like a weight outside the restaurant
19302920	19304920	if you are over that weight
19304920	19306920	you get to eat for free
19306920	19308920	I'm like wow
19308920	19310920	25 stone equals 160 kg
19310920	19312920	mmm
19312920	19314920	what are you going to do
19314920	19316920	stab him
19316920	19318920	he says as he gets shanked
19318920	19320920	I was a bit premature there
19320920	19322920	wow we are like
19322920	19324920	burning through these
19324920	19326920	well I don't know what level
19326920	19328920	I can cook those
19328920	19330920	octopusies
19330920	19332920	but
19332920	19334920	I think we'll go to the grand exchange
19334920	19336920	and buy some I have a terrible feeling
19336920	19338920	they are
19338920	19340920	a membership only
19340920	19342920	item
19342920	19344920	so we might have to swap to a membership world
19344920	19346920	which is a shame for anyone who's not a member
19346920	19348920	the heart attack grill
19348920	19350920	mmm
19352920	19354920	isn't heart attack grill
19354920	19356920	just a place because the owner hates fat people
19356920	19358920	and wants them to die
19358920	19360920	is that the lore
19360920	19362920	or
19362920	19364920	wines is probably better
19364920	19366920	at that point
19366920	19368920	wait carabaan
19368920	19370920	wines better than carabaan
19370920	19372920	caramwa
19372920	19374920	I'm sorry
19374920	19376920	I'm not saying that right
19376920	19378920	I'm not even going to pretend I'm saying it right
19378920	19380920	what level cooking
19380920	19382920	I am 70 on the dot

19456920	19458920	acknowledge with that
19458920	19460920	that due to the Irish
19460920	19462920	potato famine
19462920	19464920	which was actually just a British government
19464920	19466920	starving the people
19466920	19468920	a lot of Irish migrants
19468920	19470920	went into Scotland
19470920	19472920	because it's a
19472920	19474920	very close company

20054760	20060440	be crazy because it would make it so much easier of all through like the max lobby size is four
20060440	20065960	so three reeflings at a time can do a run with me and and i'll just do it the way we did with

20274200	20276840	I don't like about Wines as it's over so quickly.
20278280	20280680	It's over so quickly, it's so quick.
20281720	20283240	I can't reach out and think.
20283960	20288600	Either die here, a hero, or live long enough to be on the market.
20289240	20289800	Honestly.
20290600	20293080	Oh god, my brain can't keep up with this.
20293080	20293560	Escape.
20294200	20297320	God, we're even, we're at like almost 5k grade.
20297880	20300040	Wait, oh sorry, I was supposed to do space one up.
20301640	20303560	Do you plan on making an old school runescape pop?
20303560	20305160	No, I don't know what planning is.
20305160	20307400	I've never done it or been in one before.
20307400	20311720	I just used to be the scammer at the exchange post that was like double in money.
20311720	20312280	That's me.
20313240	20314040	That's what I did.
20315800	20316680	I can't believe it.
20316680	20317480	I can't believe it.
20319400	20320360	Wait, combine?
20320360	20321800	Oh, I never hit escape that time.
20326920	20328120	Wait, what?
20328120	20329800	Did Stony cause a spike?
20329800	20333240	Apparently the price of trout is going really weird right now.
20333720	20337400	Stony took all my money.
20337400	20339480	I'm sorry, I took your 1000 gold.
20339480	20344280	I assure you I did absolutely nothing with it because I abandoned the account probably and never bothered again.
20345960	20346760	Price trout.
20347720	20349480	Trout is 41.
20352520	20353240	Raw trout.
20355800	20358120	190 for raw trout.
20359320	20361160	Quick selling for like 189.
20363560	20364520	Did we actually?
20364520	20365080	One goes.
20365640	20367000	Oh wait, sorry, sorry.
20367000	20368120	I'm messing up the struts.
20370600	20373800	Stony drawing a big tentacle in the price chart.
20380920	20385720	Well, I'm happy that we at least reached 70.
20387720	20389080	That is good.
20389720	20391480	Sorry, I'm messing up the strut.
20391480	20392280	Please don't look.
20392280	20393560	Please don't look, I'm embarrassed.
20393560	20398040	Um, I don't know what we're going to end on.
20398040	20403240	If we do, I think someone said it was like five endurance streams.
20403240	20407240	If I just like non-stop did this, then I would reach it.
20407240	20408280	I was hoping.
20411640	20413080	Wait, oh no, I messed that up.
20413080	20414680	Oh no, it's going to ferment.
20414680	20419000	Don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment, don't ferment.
20419880	20425800	I was like, honestly, it's less about being efficient and more about saving our hands.
20427800	20430520	So you guys don't have to stoke the fire for me all the time.
20438600	20439100	Wah.
20440200	20443480	Bing, bang, boom, bat pal.
20444600	20447080	Ah, I completely did not strut that up, but whatever.
20448040	20451320	Eh, Stronner really wants that giant XP bomb.
20451320	20455640	Well, I'm wondering, could we just keep doing it until they're all gone?
20455640	20460280	I don't know how long it takes to do 6,000 wines though.
20460280	20465400	I could only do 14 per inventory slot, which is a bit of a problem.
20467240	20470440	So I need like just, what, 14?
20471640	20475000	How many 14s does it take to get to 100?
20475000	20475560	I don't know.
20477400	20480280	But I'm gonna be here for a while, I think.
20480280	20481240	Or is it 6?
20482600	20483480	No, 14.
20484600	20486520	My right wrist is death messed up.
20486520	20488040	Oh my god, are you okay, Riefling?
20488600	20489320	From this game?
20489320	20490520	Because you've been playing this game?
20493560	20494520	So many grapes.
20496920	20499240	Wait, people just XP bomb for fun?
20501960	20502680	Mostly yes.
20502840	20503480	It's not cool.
20505240	20507720	Keep going to click on that guy, but I'm not to click on him.
20508680	20511160	Right, empty the sack.
20511160	20512840	Click on the ingredients.
20512840	20515560	Escape, combine, space bar.
20515560	20516760	See, I didn't write that time.
20516760	20519000	I have to like mentally bring it to my head.
20521800	20522360	How much?
20524600	20525160	Seven.
20525160	20528200	So I need seven inventories to do 100.
20528200	20529000	That's quite a lot.
20529880	20538440	I've messed up, but that's okay.
20538440	20539400	I'm trying my best.
20541400	20546440	You need roughly 62k wines to get from 68 to 99.
20546440	20546920	Bruv!
20548120	20549160	Who picked this?
20549160	20549800	Is there not?
20549800	20551160	Right, let's do fletching.
20551160	20552840	We can do fletching in four hours.
20554200	20555720	We're getting how many wines?
20556280	20558920	There's no way I can do that.
20559320	20561240	I'm starting, oh no, I'm starting to have doubt.
20561800	20563400	Reflings, have I messed up?
20564360	20566040	Have I messed up picking this game?
20568280	20570040	It's 200 XP per wine.
20570040	20571240	Oh, that's more than the fish.
20573080	20575160	Fletching is death going to mess up your route.
20576280	20578120	Have I made a mistake picking King?
20579400	20580280	I'm getting nervous.
20580280	20581240	I'm getting chicken.
20581240	20584360	Now, I did say the next time we do RuneScape,
20585000	20588920	I'm going, we're going to do a movie watch along as well,
20589800	20592280	just so I can rest my voice.
20596920	20598360	How's the cooking going?
20598360	20600600	We're starting to feel a bit daunted now,
20600600	20604440	and it's starting to settle in like, oh no, this is a lot.
20605960	20609640	The next time we do a RuneScape stream,
20609640	20611720	we are going to be watching a movie series,
20611720	20614040	so I don't have to talk and I can rest my voice a little bit,
20614040	20616360	because I do have quite a few ASMR collabs coming up,
20616360	20619000	and I need to keep my voice steady.
20619720	20621720	I need my voice to be steady and ready.
20622600	20625560	Wines are like 480k if you're consistent.
20626280	20629960	Per hour, I mean, it's all right.
20633640	20639160	You need 87k swordfish, so wines are still faster in the end.
20639160	20640360	Oh my gosh.
20640360	20642360	Oh.
20645560	20646440	Reeflings.
20646440	20648760	I think I might have messed up picking cooking,
20649960	20651320	but I really want 99.
20651320	20653080	I've never had my first 99 before.
20656280	20658280	Oh, I'm getting nervous.
20658280	20659320	I'm getting shaky.
20659320	20660040	Just drain back.
20660040	20662040	What's with the ritual dance at the top of the screen?
20662040	20663080	Those are reeflings.
20663080	20664520	They're just dancing with each other.
20665160	20666760	We're all hanging out at the fire.
20667720	20670040	Remember, level 92 is halfway.
20670040	20670600	Stop.
20670600	20671560	Is it actually?
20678360	20679160	No.
20679160	20680760	I will not give myself doubt.
20682280	20685560	I'll see what happens after the movie marathon.
20689160	20690760	XP wise, it's halfway.
20691400	20694280	I know what happened to the legendary stamina.
20694280	20695400	I'm getting nervous.
20695400	20697720	I don't know if I have an end in stamina now.
20698440	20699400	I'm getting shaky.
20699400	20700200	Wait.
20700200	20700520	Right.
20700520	20701000	Empty.
20706920	20709400	Cooking is the fastest without completely ruined.
20709400	20710440	Like cooking fish.
20712280	20715160	Isn't it good that we'll be there with it?
20717240	20717640	Yeah.
20717640	20719480	Next runescape stream though.
20719480	20720680	I'm going to be watching a movie,
20720680	20724680	so I'm not talking too much because my voice is getting shredded.
20725960	20727080	But I love it.
20727080	20727720	Can't help.
20727720	20728680	Can't stop talking.
20728680	20729000	Okay.
20733240	20734920	Making winds is faster.
20736840	20739160	But the reeflings here in 99 shouldn't be a problem.
20739160	20739480	Okay.
20739480	20739800	Okay.
20739800	20740280	Okay.
20744040	20744440	Wow.
20745640	20749000	Although it'd be really cool to look back and see how much time I spent.
20750120	20754200	I wouldn't mind doing some questing after we get 99 cooking.
20754760	20760040	I don't know if I'm going to be able to do 99 cooking in one month though.
20760040	20762440	Because of the streams that I've got planned out.
20762440	20764760	It doesn't really work that well.
20764760	20765880	Because of Elden Ring.
20768840	20769960	Because of Elden Ring.
20771960	20775240	I would have been able to put more time into Rinscape.
20775240	20776600	But because of Elden Ring.
20777560	20778440	99 cooking.
20778440	20780840	That's all because of a mediocre joke.
20780840	20781800	That you're a whammin.
20782360	20782840	Hell yeah.
20783640	20784600	You got this Johnny.
20785400	20786520	We'll make you our ma-
20786520	20787880	We'll get you a master chef.
20791720	20797720	But it would be kind of cool to look back at like the stream thumbnails and see how much time it took.
20798680	20800520	Obviously we did some questing.
20800520	20804120	The first I had so much fun like doing all those quests and like waiting for everyone
20804120	20806280	and be like okay we'll do this next we'll do this next.
20807080	20812040	Um so if I do achieve 99 cooking and I'm not burnt out of Rinscape.
20812920	20815000	Then pardon me I'm burping away here.
20815640	20822440	Uh I actually wouldn't mind um I wouldn't mind what.
20822440	20825480	I wouldn't mind doing some more questing again together because that's quite fun.
20825480	20832360	And it's more interactive than literally you do need to do a quest to cook a coambas.
20832360	20835480	I can never say I don't know what on earth I'm supposed to pronounce them as.
20836200	20840600	Um are they better XP than wine?
20840840	20843160	This is the question.
20844440	20847320	Do I need combat for that quest by any chance?
20852360	20855000	50 subs away from 60 stop.
20855000	20856760	Is that video still getting traction?
20857400	20858920	Yat. Oh my yat.
20859960	20861800	Sticking at my yat for the river.
20863720	20866040	Oh would a Scottish cover of that go viral?
20866920	20868760	Only by tick manipulating.
20868760	20873400	Right no if wait so I'm just doing wines for the rest of this entire gig.
20875480	20879800	Oh no it's only faster if you're paying attention.
20880920	20882760	I'm just doing wines for the rest.
20882760	20885080	Oh this is terrible stream content.
20887160	20890840	You guys just seem to go back and forth to make more wines.
20890840	20893480	Wait so then why was that chick doing lobsters?
20893720	20897400	We're the one with the big jibblies out.
20897400	20899560	Why does she do lobsters for chicken?
20899560	20901160	Is lobsters cheaper?
20901160	20901960	Cheaper.
20901960	20903160	Can I always switch it up?
20903160	20905960	Yeah I'll maybe finish my swordfish.
20905960	20910360	Once this batch for a minute I'll swap back to the swordfish.
20910360	20913160	Just so like everything the reeflings gave me and being used up.
20913160	20914920	That seems like the wisest thing.
20914920	20915480	It's cum.
20916760	20918520	Oh yeah you like when I yap at you?
20918520	20920200	I'll yap all over you.
20920200	20921160	All over your face.
20921720	20922360	Your stomach.
20923240	20923880	Your thighs.
20925960	20928840	Fish would be way slower but way less attention.
20928840	20933240	Yeah um the wane attention batch is getting pretty rough.
20933240	20936280	I know I can I'm sorry I'm touching my boob right now.
20936280	20939160	I'm like I'm not even pretending otherwise.
20939160	20940920	Um I've only got one hand.
20940920	20941800	Available right now.
20944280	20945400	We do love the gap.
20945400	20947480	You can literally just talk to us for the content.
20947480	20948680	That's why I'm here.
20953320	20957240	Oh no right.
20957960	20960920	I think we can finish off the swordfish and the wane.
20963160	20966440	Also it was actually really funny that you just straight up handed me like your
20966440	20967400	wane collection.
20967400	20968280	No questions.
20968280	20969640	You're not like no this is mine.
20969640	20971160	You're just like I hear habits Johnny.
20972360	20974600	That's quite funny actually now that I think about it.
20974600	20976280	You're like oh there's no point in arguing.
20976280	20976920	She can have it.
20977880	20980600	Um wow.
20982040	20983160	Wow you did it.
20986360	20986840	Rank.
20989000	20989480	Wow.
20991400	20992520	Oh that's so big.
20994200	20995080	Thanks so much.
20996280	21000440	Oh you can get it.
21001240	21002840	Oh sorry I'm getting distracted.
21002840	21003880	Wane don't ferment.
21003880	21004840	I got distracted.
21004840	21005800	I was reading.
21005800	21006440	Don't ferment.
21006440	21007080	Don't ferment.
21010440	21012120	Your yapping is so strong.
21012120	21014360	You forgot that you were also playing RuneScape.
21014360	21016440	The game is more a background to you.
21016440	21016920	Honestly.
21017640	21019560	Reef was trying to get a moment of rope.
21019560	21020840	With all this wine.
21020840	21021480	Exactly.
21023480	21026120	Forfeit all mortal possessions to the cult of vice.
21026120	21027880	No look after yourself.
21027880	21029160	Get yourself out of debt.
21029960	21032360	Buy yourself treaties at the corner shop.
21033240	21034680	And then and only then.
21035800	21037560	The fermentation is top left.
21037560	21038040	Oh.
21040360	21041080	Wow.
21041080	21041880	That's so cool.
21041880	21043000	Man Rune.
21043000	21045400	Rune light plug-in is so good.
21047720	21048760	We're learning.
21048760	21049400	We're learning.
21056600	21057320	Plap plap plap.
21057320	21057880	Don't ferment.
21057880	21058440	Don't ferment.
21058440	21059240	Don't ferment.
21059240	21060920	I was actually there is like this
21060920	21062680	feature of her that posted a thing.
21063240	21064360	Where this song's like.
21064520	21068040	Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
21068040	21070680	And she goes get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant get pregnant.
21070680	21073480	And I was gonna remake it and be like.
21073480	21075880	Get pregnant get main break get main break get main break.
21075880	21077240	But I can't say it that fast.
21078680	21081800	But I was gonna add like plap sound effects and all that and the music.
21081800	21084200	And like plap plap and then do my hypnosis thing.
21085000	21087800	Also that timer stuff can be moved by holding O and dragging it.
21088520	21091080	I'll leave it in the top corner where it belongs for now.
21095000	21096200	Mm mm mm mm.
21099880	21102120	Was that the one by someone underscore?
21102120	21105160	It was um it got like 6,000 likes.
21105160	21107880	And I was like oh my god I want to make a rifling version of that.
21109000	21111640	So I was like get main break get main break get main break get main break.
21113160	21113400	Yeah.
21116360	21120840	Oh I keep going to click on the banker but she's not gone.
21120840	21122440	I don't need to do that.
21122440	21124200	God there's so much going on over there.
21124760	21125800	You can perish it.
21130840	21132040	I think I remember seeing that.
21132040	21135240	Yeah I like went pretty viral and I saw it and I was like oh my god I want a rifling version.
21135240	21137000	So I'm gonna put my hypno eyes on and stuff.
21137560	21139880	I'd be all hey pregnant go pregnant go.
21139880	21141480	Well I'm not pregnant in your case.
21143320	21144680	Get your boy pregnant.
21145960	21146760	Not really for me.
21149240	21151560	Astrony you can't imagine what's happening by the way.
21151560	21152840	Wait why what do you mean?
21157000	21158360	What does that mean?
21158360	21159800	Why does that sound like a veiled?
21161480	21161880	Truth.
21165240	21168280	I mean we're almost at 4k water.
21168280	21170280	We've just done about 500 there.
21171720	21177000	I'm wondering if I can do it in one sitting and just let the XP pop and then I'll be satisfied with that.
21177960	21180840	Oh maybe.
21180840	21182840	Maybe baby if I don't mess it up.
21183800	21184120	What?
21185400	21187400	Hello I want to grab that.
21187400	21188600	Oh my god.
21189960	21192200	Riflings are such sugar daddies.
21193000	21195960	That was 7 million just hanging out on a table.
21197960	21199960	I literally actually did a gilded.
21199960	21203480	Someone got into dropping a gilded freaking plate armor.
21203640	21207640	People are storming the channel.
21208440	21209720	Are y'all winning, Astrony?
21212200	21213320	Get in pregnant.
21213320	21214840	Yeah I've never really been.
21216280	21219480	I mean I'll cater to everyone but it's not wrong for me.
21222360	21227080	I'm pretty sure the viral version was either they get pregnant by it or get me pregnant.
21229240	21232040	No Shiori no it wasn't that one.
21233640	21234840	I didn't see the Shiori.
21234840	21241800	I know what the Shiori one is but I definitely must have seen it from the other chick.
21249240	21250120	I want to grab that.
21251560	21252840	Astrony reading my words.
21253960	21254600	I want to grab that.
21254600	21255480	Let me shake your hand.
21257880	21259800	I'm already here lord of storms.
21263720	21271160	I'm just going to check when Azur comes.
21272280	21273480	What was that noise?
21273480	21277000	Why is that a look away for a millisecond and there's lots of weird noises going on?
21277640	21278280	Hold on.
21278280	21278920	Hold on.
21278920	21280280	Let me check when Azur comes on.
21281560	21282360	Subscriptions.
21284680	21285320	Azur.
21285320	21288200	Why does it not say Azur is coming up next?
21288200	21289160	That's so annoying.
21291960	21292600	Oh no!
21292600	21293320	Oh my freaking...
21294600	21295400	Wait I'm going to do it.
21295400	21295960	I'm going to do it.
21295960	21296520	I'm going to do it.
21302520	21305240	How could I forget the Wayne fermentation?
21305960	21307880	How could I have been so silly?
21308840	21310520	I just wanted to make sure when Azur was coming on.
21311640	21313000	Level 72.
21313000	21313960	Right I'll take it.
21313960	21314920	Level 72.
21316520	21318040	That's actually not that bad though.
21319080	21320040	I'm quite happy with that.
21323000	21325320	198k?
21325320	21326520	198k?
21326520	21327160	Seriously?
21329400	21329880	Whoops.
21331320	21332440	That was good though.
21335080	21335960	That was really good.
21335960	21338680	Okay maybe Wayne's is the way to go because
21340200	21341080	big if true.
21342840	21345400	And I'm not even finished fermenting all the wine that I've got.
21346440	21346840	Hold on.
21346840	21350600	I'm going to put the heating on because I'm absolutely frozen in my room.
21353160	21353660	Oh.
21358680	21359080	God.
21360680	21362360	It's 15 degrees.
21362360	21364520	How am I supposed to survive in these conditions?
21365640	21374040	Yeah apparently um Australian I rent um but oh where my key?
21374040	21374520	Hold on.
21374520	21375160	Cable?
21375160	21375640	Cable?
21375640	21376360	Hold on.
21376360	21376920	Okay I've got it.
21376920	21377160	I've got it.
21379160	21382360	I just I just popped the last into this 73.
21382360	21385480	I would have jumped three levels if I managed to do one more batch.
21385480	21386040	All right hold on.
21386040	21388280	Let's see what's going on with my Azura Deleu.
21389000	21391080	I thought she is coming up.
21391080	21391560	Oh my god.
21392120	21393320	At the Ura.
21393320	21394440	Please spell correctly.
21395960	21396600	There she is.
21398200	21399720	There she is.
21399720	21402040	Oh literally in T minus two minutes.
21402760	21407400	Um Azura is playing a absolutely precious game called Shrey.
21407400	21412120	I have not yet had the pleasure to play it but it looks bloody good yeah.
21413160	21420760	Yeah if you've made the 1000 wins it would have been a too much game.
21421640	21424600	Listen to Strony Yat while at work and produce product to me.
21424600	21433320	I feel like I'm like um uh I feel like I would distract being like at work and stuff.
21435400	21440760	Honestly honestly if I had an office I feel like I'd be like one of them
21440760	21444120	bosses that couldn't just give her rats arms.
21444120	21448920	I'm like as long as you do the work go home early doesn't bother me none.
21451000	21456200	Seems like whenever someone gets a manager type job they think they call the shots and it was like
21456200	21458120	no you're at the mercy of your workers.
21458680	21460120	Let's let's not get it twisted.
21461000	21462200	Let's not get it twisted.
21464360	21465800	Are you doing Marshmallow later?
21465800	21468040	Yeah of course I'll do Marshmallow more than happy to.
21468920	21473800	I would I'll do it when we do when we go back to the fish because unfortunately the
21473800	21480200	wanes require a lot more um like fast clicking.
21481000	21486440	Every time I move to the left I need to too and I'm I'm getting nervous.
21486440	21494520	Now not to be a minger but when I tried to go to toilet but nothing came out and I'm worried
21494520	21497960	I'm gonna have to go toilet in the middle of the stream but I don't want to go toilet.
21501400	21506360	I normally take a shower after I I don't I don't.
21508680	21511160	Felt oh my most what time's come in here.
21512200	21515720	Oops but yes I will do Marshmallow it's not problem.
21518200	21520600	Use your gamer bucket please do not ever type again.
21521160	21523320	Gamer bucket.
21523320	21525560	Now pee bottles I can tolerate.
21526440	21529320	Gamer bucket like Eric Cartman style.
21529880	21532440	Ma'am ma'am I need to use the bathroom.
21536760	21538280	You gotta go for a job eh.
21540040	21541320	The birthing girl.
21541320	21546440	My team leader in quality assurance didn't solve their their premiums since months because
21546440	21549320	the workers are motivated and didn't get trained properly.
21549400	21556200	Literally just because you in the manager position does not make you a leader.
21558360	21562440	Magi playing RuneScape into N.E.24 without uh
21565000	21567960	refunds you know
21571800	21572920	the gamer bucket.
21580280	21585480	On a scale of 1 to 10 how jealous are you of men's ability to use gamer ball?
21590840	21597720	I don't think it applies to me because I have acidic like main stinks.
21599560	21601720	Actually I probably should have mentioned that to the doctor.
21602920	21605320	Eep forgot to mention it what was that?
21605320	21608840	Also if you try to do a fast knight named Fletch and your wrist would die after a few
21608840	21610520	minutes unless you learned mouse pee.
21611400	21614760	I don't have that kind of mouse I have up and down on the mouse that's it.
21618840	21621480	Good dinner ruined sorry.
21623960	21630840	Sorry okay I think we're gonna have to swap back to the swordfish just for a little bit
21630840	21633560	because this is like one after the other.
21634520	21641560	Your face your face melts off kind of acid yeah mouse keys are button presses.
21650200	21655240	However we just bought the levels and I'll just commentate over oh my god you leveled up congrats.
21656440	21658440	I'm kidding by the way we're not bought.
21659320	21664120	I don't know how bad the bots are in runescape I heard they're really bad in world of warcraft
21665400	21672200	but bots apparently keep prices low in cheeky runescape so I'm not really sure.
21674600	21677480	Gamer girl uses pee bollies more a lot.
21678600	21681560	Oh I'm already in trouble by youtube actually I should check that.
21682120	21685080	Wait no I'll check it when we're doing the fish.
21685080	21688280	Not while fest is banning the ways.
21688280	21692680	I will check it after I've done this batch of wines.
21701960	21704840	Oh yeah it's really bad and wow all versions.
21706120	21710280	I just know some people say like oh the reason why the bots are actually good is because they
21710280	21715640	keep everything low price because they're like trying to fight over the same resources type thing.
21717880	21720920	And I was like honestly that is actually valid feedback.
21721800	21728120	Right we'll go down to 5000 water and then I'm gonna swap to fish just to like use up all the
21728120	21735160	fish because it's just in there and I'll read some marshmallow q&a's if you want to say something.
21735960	21749400	Sorry I know I'm not doing that in a good way but there are bots that kill some of the
21749400	21752600	hardest bosses in the game in the tens of thousands.
21756440	21759400	Yeah bots keep runescape economy from high for inflating.
21760280	21768280	I can't believe it. Capitalism wins again even in my video games and I can't escape.
21770120	21775560	Didn't they just catch some bots and wow by placing a single row?
21775560	21778040	Oh wait I seem to remember something like that.
21779160	21779960	I think you're right.
21781720	21785400	Also just gold farmers who aren't bots they just sell the money later on.
21785400	21793400	Oh yeah you can like buy like in-game currency with like actual money so like you get given the
21793400	21800760	money or something. Because of the there's like a Venezuelan meme so the Venezuelan
21802200	21812200	Venezuelan economy went to shambles and basically it became profitable for
21813000	21819800	those individuals to play runescape and sell the in-game currency or something.
21819800	21823720	Yeah my brain's like kind of remembering that. They sell it on a third party site for
21823720	21832600	anyone who's like hmm which is against T.O.S. oh okay okay okay I don't know okay I guess it's
21832600	21838040	against T.O.S. on World of Warcraft as well then with that watch it. That could be wrong I don't know.
21838440	21845240	Azura has gone live okay if there's any bleeding hearts or any
21845240	21851240	reeflings who are needing a break from the winemaking. Azura Dooley has gone live.
21851240	21862360	She is playing a game called Stray and she's a cat and I'm not a goat so if you want to see

21899160	21905000	repeat it in order to do that brimps but no that was absolutely awful and I should be ashamed of myself
21905240	21906440	truly.
21915400	21924280	Yeah she's at 4k oh that's fantastic. Soon Ace will be 4k as well and
21926680	21931800	I'll get her to make some more adorable little shorts and I'll put some money in it and then
21931800	21938920	she can celebrate her 4k as well. Gen mate love. Gen mate love.

22591400	22596840	accusing you of putting an air tracker in it or anything like that uh the safety reasons just
22596840	22604840	completely outweigh the fund that could be in a PO box I do apologize what is a box a PO box is
22604840	22611400	like a setup location where you can send packages and and I would go retrieve them but for safety
22611400	22617320	reasons I can't have any of that so I am so sorry but thank you for being interested in sending us

22847720	22855400	assets emotes all of that it takes a year to do that kind of stuff we're at the stage of going
22855400	22862200	all the way back to the start all the way back to one paragraph about this girl all the way back to
22862200	22868040	right what are the names all the way back like we're all the way back there so please don't there's
22868040	22879880	no one um I said in the exposing veiler stream no one got a call back um there is no call back
22880920	22890680	there is no mean um take off your clothes gen 2 is ban here no it is um we're all the way back
22890680	22899400	thankfully I am not on the heavier side of um development when it comes to names or whatever
22899400	22905240	but it's like we're now going all the way back um especially like the lower art I need to think
22905240	22915000	of the story and uh but that's what I mean when I say we're all the way back to gen 2 um
22915800	22922520	uh or did you just mean characters then and models and niches and such yes that's what I meant sorry
22922520	22931480	just uh scare you no I will it'll be the exact same pro there's no date there's no date um which
22931480	22936920	I'm so freaking glad there's no date because making a deadline is horrible and I don't ever want to
22936920	22944440	have a deadline like that again um the announcements for that kind of stuff only will come out when
22944440	22953640	things are ready and uh as I said the generation one will be up for a year before gen 2 even like
22955000	22960520	yeah it'll be at least a year like after do you know I mean I don't know if that means something
22960520	22965960	good night I'ma turn in please rest well sorry I'm a star too busy rambling sleep well those of you
22965960	22974680	who need to sleep um but yes uh it's it took a year for development it is not quick it's not easy
22974680	22978920	it's not fast um and especially when you've got artists that love to go over deadlines um
22981640	22987320	it makes everything an absolute nightmare um I kind of said a wee bit of it on the
22987320	22994840	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood stream I had planned everything to occur within certain months
22995640	23002760	and then everything went to because artists all unanimously went over deadlines so if you're
23002760	23009000	an artist that works with us look I'm not mad at you everyone did it so you know you know it's fine
23009720	23020120	but uh everyone went over and it made everything happen in May when May was supposed to be
23020120	23025480	where I fully focused on getting stuff done for the girls and like we're still kind of picking up
23025480	23030120	the pieces like I'm doing stuff I shouldn't really have shouldn't be doing at the stage
23030120	23036040	like it was supposed to be handed off or there's supposed to be something else in place um but it
23036040	23046680	just uh nightmare nightmare how many marshmallows do you have 850 on the dot actually 850 um
23050040	23058120	yes I don't even know how I got on that rant hey I still have two ideas for a gen two
23058120	23063960	what would you want to tell us which one two things that I think would be popular a lollipop dragon
23064120	23071240	there's no lollipop dragon vtuber's curious to get to do it after the pandora on anything
23072040	23079640	also I think an insect girl in the style of a traditional japanese geisha who uses her own
23079640	23084600	self to make her clothes be popular that's unique I've not heard that not a bad idea
23089240	23092840	uh I think I need a jobby
23095320	23099640	I think I need a mute and go hold on it makes me still mix going

23140600	23147080	okay let's do one more bank run and I'll start cooking and then I'll mute because uh the toilet

23195160	23211080	so
23345160	23373500	Are you squiddling me right now?
23433500	23444220	There was no loaf of bread to be had, but I took it again.
23444220	23449660	I'm also ovulating like crazy, just thought you should know.
23450160	23455160	Bro, the amount of ink that just came out of me, holy shit.
23459160	23463160	So I don't mind talking about this because I've got hands on chicks.
23463160	23471160	When whammin' ovulate, you get a clear ink that comes out of you, produced naturally.
23471160	23474160	And I just had that and I was like, what?
23474660	23481660	So I'm like, well, now's the best time to send any bibbutes.
23481660	23492160	I had no idea, but that makes sense why I'm tired because I just want, you know, my body wants one thing.
23492160	23502160	I have over 2,000 burnt pork, bitch, that was so cool.
23502160	23504160	Good to know.
23504160	23506160	That made my neurons burn.
23506160	23508160	Bro, I wish I could have shown you that, honestly.
23508160	23510160	I was like, what, an error?
23511160	23525160	Yes, I don't know what's happening with my butt though.
23525160	23530160	I need to go number two, but nothing's happening.
23530160	23532160	You like receiving bibbutes?
23532160	23536160	Go, go.
23536160	23539160	I am down atrocious, I volunteer.
23539160	23541160	Hey guys, do you want to make Gen 2 right now?
23541160	23543160	I'm ovulating.
23543160	23547160	Oh my god, we can just say that every time I ovulate, I'll be like, Gen 2.
23547160	23549160	Come on.
23549160	23551160	Oh, good to know.
23554160	23557160	Humans are just monkeys with fanfare shoes though.
23557160	23559160	Oh, thoughts.
23559160	23561160	Not quite, close enough.
23561160	23564160	But a few more evolutionary factors in there.
23564160	23570160	Multiply, refling, produce, feature, activity.
23570160	23574160	Sorry, I'm stuttering.
23574160	23577160	Well, we have over 200 volunteers.
23577160	23580160	Hi, volunteers.
23580160	23584160	We did it, we're in the, we're in a million XP.
23584160	23586160	God, wines are so fast.
23586160	23591160	We were, I don't even think we were like, I don't even know what we were at the start of the stream.
23591160	23595160	But we're already a million XP, that's fantastic.
23595160	23601160	Seriously, we're making, I think the wines really is the vehicle.
23603160	23605160	Aw, someone said, thank you for existing.
23605160	23607160	You're so awesome, refling.
23607160	23609160	Thank you for existing.
23610160	23612160	Uh...
23619160	23623160	Oh, I don't know, I kind of...
23623160	23628160	Someone is currently anonymously editing for the girls, but they don't want any credit.
23628160	23630160	But we are gonna upload the videos.
23630160	23632160	You don't need to apologize for not subtitling it.
23632160	23634160	Subtitling, don't take long on.
23634160	23636160	The videos are like, three minutes long.
23637160	23643160	So, are the Gen 1 models quintuplets?
23643160	23649160	I like to joke that I had the girls in my stomach for like, how long?
23649160	23650160	12 months?
23650160	23653160	Yeah, I guess 12 months on the dot.
23653160	23655160	Nearly there, 5.98.
23655160	23657160	Oh my god, I owe you guys so much.
23657160	23660160	There's some more videos, I'm not even uploaded the first one.
23661160	23671160	Um, I think I'm gonna be too tired after stream though, to edit and upload the first one.
23673160	23678160	Oh my god, problems of being an overachiever for the male.
23678160	23683160	Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid?
23683160	23686160	I don't think I've played it, but I've definitely heard of it.
23687160	23690160	Game suggestions, Mad Rat Dead.
23690160	23693160	It's a rhythm platform game on Nintendo.
23693160	23694160	How odd.
23694160	23697160	Creeps, it's a puzzle game with a rare art style.
23697160	23701160	The storyline is decent and you can use it to interact with chat if you get stuck.
23701160	23704160	I do it like when chat holds my hand through game.
23704160	23707160	Uh, how'd you mention SteelSeries during the collab?
23707160	23709160	Hopefully it works well for you.
23709160	23715160	No, whenever Azura talks to me, I don't know if the other girls can hear Azura.
23715160	23721160	Whenever Azura talks to me via Discord, her make always cuts out and can't handle her.
23721160	23724160	And I'm like, Azura, get that noise gate off.
23724160	23726160	And she's like, I've not got anything on.
23726160	23729160	And I'm like, what is, like, what's, what's she's in?
23729160	23732160	Cause I can never hear her, I think the other girls can hear her.
23734160	23738160	But I can never hear her when we like have a collab on Discord or anything.
23738160	23742160	And when she gets excited, it cuts into her even more.
23742160	23746160	But I don't know if she has, like, Discord filters on maybe.
23746160	23749160	Which is why I'm like, ah, Azura, are you in that SteelSeries?
23749160	23752160	Cause I've said to her a few times now, but I'm not annoyed or anything.
23752160	23755160	It's more like a meme where I'm like, ah, SteelSeries.
23755160	23760160	And someone has sent me a cat box, should it open up?
23760160	23762160	Fuck it, I'm feeling risky.
23762160	23764160	What is it? It's a picture.
23764160	23766160	Whoa! Okay!
23766160	23769160	Yep, that's the picture, alright.
23772160	23776160	Okay, I'm not, I'm not gonna open up any cat books.
23776160	23778160	Uh, links.
23778160	23780160	On, while I'm here.
23784160	23786160	Okay!
23786160	23788160	Okay, Swordfish.
23788160	23790160	Swordfish, yes.
23790160	23792160	Um...
23792160	23794160	Blumow.
23794160	23796160	Share it with a class male.
23798160	23800160	I, uh, cuddle.
23800160	23802160	Are you okay with me using soul smagment?
23802160	23804160	Smagment, oh my god.
23804160	23806160	I've got cocks on my mind, what the fuck.
23806160	23810160	Soul, small segment of the clapping audio for a meme.
23810160	23812160	Yeah, sure, if so, would you rather wait?
23812160	23814160	Now, um, now you can post it, it's fine, honestly.
23814160	23817160	It's cause it's, cause it's gonna be publicly posted.
23817160	23820160	It's not, it's not really an issue to make any of the content a meme.
23820160	23822160	I'm so sorry, ah, ah, frickin.
23822160	23826160	That was, that would poke your eye out, that's all I'm saying.
23826160	23828160	That's all I'm gonna leave out, that would poke your eye out.
23828160	23830160	Um...
23830160	23834160	Oh, she's so damn bad, just like us, real, real.
23834160	23836160	Keep being that lovable goofy gibber you are.
23836160	23838160	Oh, thank you, Reefling.
23838160	23840160	Strony!
23840160	23842160	Reefling!
23842160	23844160	I listened to the girlfriend begs the whole day tomorrow.
23844160	23848160	I remembered you apologizing about no editing as much.
23848160	23852160	I think, at least in this case, less editing of mistakes added to the quality.
23852160	23855160	I'm so frickin glad you agree, Reefling.
23855160	23861160	I have been enjoying, like, not doing scripted stuff and tryharding.
23861160	23863160	Um...
23863160	23865160	Um...
23865160	23869160	Like, I have been enjoying recording ASMR.
23869160	23873160	That isn't scripted, and I'm doing it off the top of my head.
23873160	23874160	Wait, wait, what do you say?
23874160	23876160	There was one part where you seemed to accidentally say,
23876160	23880160	let me hold your fireman, then wait, let me hold your hose, Mr. Fireman.
23880160	23883160	It felt so natural, cause of how frantic you were becoming.
23883160	23886160	Yeah, because I did it all off the top of my head.
23886160	23888160	Um...
23888160	23890160	I don't know if it was scripted, but you also yawned at one point.
23890160	23892160	If it was intentional or ad-lib, it was so natural.
23892160	23898160	No, I've been enjoying doing, like, non-hyper-edited, super production of the wazoo.
23898160	23900160	I've been enjoying doing, like, such casual...
23900160	23902160	Um, it's been so lovely.
23902160	23904160	I've been enjoying it thoroughly.
23904160	23907160	I really hope you enjoy the first, like, thank you for 1000 subs,
23907160	23909160	cause it's just me, me-man.
23909160	23911160	Um...
23911160	23913160	From work! Ayyy!
23914160	23916160	Okay, but how many strongy-hands big was it?
23916160	23918160	I mean...
23918160	23921160	There wasn't a ruler in the picture, but...
23922160	23926160	From the glance I got before I closed it, it was pretty...
23926160	23928160	3D knee...
23930160	23932160	I laughed so much in that part, aww.
23933160	23935160	I don't know if it was scripted or not, but you...
23935160	23936160	Or I'll say that...
23936160	23939160	If any of it was scripted, that kind of reinforces my point.
23939160	23943480	points so much of the audio scripted are not felt natural even the mistakes seemed no no that
23943480	23949960	that was just me that's just me being unable to read uh unable to read unable to formulate my
23949960	23954840	my thoughts into our proper sentence structure uh i know it was just the meme but it was really fun
23954840	23960280	and good i think it would be neat to do the natural style more i i freaking agree i 100%
23960280	23976840	i'm doing natural style open natural style as i said we're gonna finish cooking all the swordfish
23976840	23987480	and then we'll go back to wine just because wine is so demanding um if you want to help hold the
23987480	23992760	hose during a number one does that mean i get to hold you up when you go number one brah i would
23992760	24002440	go everywhere if you did that um straw night i felt it's imperative to let you know there's a
24002440	24010680	fortnite skin called tropical punch zoe that looks shockingly like you i swear to god if i look like
24010680	24025240	a fortnite character if i look like a fortnite uh i can i can cane to see i know what you mean
24025240	24034040	with the bows on our head i get it yeah i get it no that's not bad thankfully i don't look too much
24034040	24046280	like but i get it would only need to ask once to hold by the way the subtitles were actually fun
24047320	24053560	but why didn't you make someone else do them well when i do all that stuff there's like
24054280	24059720	no subtitling takes so much time like it's it's just such a waste of money as well because not
24059800	24067640	everyone reads the files um until like outsource that work even further is just like oh i'd rather
24067640	24072120	just save the money and like spend it on the girls type thing because i could have sent that to an
24072120	24078040	editor and i could have sent that to a video like renderer type thing it's just like i'll just do it
24078040	24079960	myself you know
24085640	24091160	oh i've got 14 more questions don't make me or is it even a question

24106920	24112520	on the topic conspiracy series one game would be a suit to watch you play disco asylum it's
24112520	24117880	basically a spruced up visual novel where you play as a deeply schizophrenic police officer have
24117880	24123640	it small solve a murder we'll constantly argue with the voices all that's interesting hold on that

24211560	24213080	words outside your comfort zone
24213880	24219720	hey stroney just wondering when you plan on sitting on my face right now
24221480	24221960	lie down
24227000	24232040	since ai is blowing up right now any ideas of implementing it in your content
24233240	24235000	no and do you even want to
24240120	24240520	um
24240680	24241180	um
24243000	24252280	the only i wouldn't put um ai content like monetize it i don't think that's right i don't
24252280	24261160	mind like ai memes of myself or something like that like that's funny um but like actually ai
24261160	24266440	content like i wouldn't use ai content on a thumbnail and then earn money from it like i don't think
24267400	24272440	i don't think that's very nice because as a content creator like someone can literally you
24272440	24276920	know yank your voice and then make money off of it and it was like well why would i do the same
24277560	24284760	to someone else like that's not nice you know can you hold it do you think you can handle
24287480	24293720	um have you considered trading a chat box from your stream absolutely not are you kidding me that
24293720	24298200	all that thing we'll see is use the other hole refling other hole other hole other hole
24299240	24301160	that all that chat box is gonna say
24304520	24309000	i don't really use marshmallow marshmallow very often if someone wanted to send you a
24309000	24316440	bit but how it says oh you do what's called a cat box link and then you send me the link

25207180	25210180	You're like oh god finally strong. He's not doing it anymore. I
25211500	25214180	Say that as if I'm not writing all my own stuff
25214180	25220420	But I want to write my own stuff because I'm passionate about it not to say that script master isn't passionate
25220420	25225780	But I quite like writing my stuff because it feels it feels more intimate when I can like do it between
25226120	25232400	Me and we fling, you know, we do it together and I have you in mind. You are my muse we fling. You are my muse and
25233600	25236480	Feed the fire for mummet. Thank you

25259360	25262800	Yours are exceptionally good. Oh, that's very kind. I I like
25262800	25267520	Um, I did have the option to hand over my scripts to someone else
25267520	25273680	But I I like doing it between us really need this fire making XP for real for real
25275560	25277560	I
25277600	25285600	Imagine you and the other girls write their own stuff. There was a hand full of girls who wanted to give their hand at it
25285840	25293600	I absolutely did not expect it because um, it's just more time and I don't want the girls like stressing out over that kind of thing
25296800	25298800	But yeah, I
25301480	25305800	Just don't want to stress the girls out if they want to do it of their own violation
25306560	25310840	We all listen and then that's perfect. Did I just hear?
25316360	25318360	She's not happy a feather
25320360	25322360	and
25322680	25328340	Day 10 of eating celery daily is so bad. Oh, no, don't put yourself through celery for that
25328960	25337880	Celery is nasty. I've never enjoyed it. I'm sorry. Doesn't matter how much like humus you put on it view a listen by a listen
25338400	25343400	Did I just say it funny bullish in bullish in there's no I okay. We're getting there
25344000	25346360	Stopped flusterers exactly
25348440	25350440	He he oh my goodness
25352360	25354480	Violation oh no, now you're getting me confused
25355680	25363400	Yeah, I love your scripts on patreon strony. Thank you. I did them off the top of my head myself
25365120	25367120	I
25367240	25372480	Will be very curious to see what the doughnut song results in I have I
25373120	25375920	Imagine the week after the doughnut song concludes
25375920	25380800	I will be having very short streams so I can focus on the rewards one at a time
25381360	25388000	And I know some agencies had a bit problems trying to handle streaming and getting rewards out
25388600	25390600	obviously because I'm such an
25391120	25392480	unbelievably
25392480	25399560	Bad workaholic or good however you want it good for people who like content content content bad for the actual
25400720	25408960	Workaholic themselves because they just non-stop keep going, but I think I definitely am in a position where I can get stuff out
25409960	25411960	relatively quick
25412400	25414880	Whether that be an audio a collab audio
25417240	25418880	Yeah
25418880	25424120	Maybe those are good if you want your money from birds. I have a huge backlog of willow logs from doing
25425960	25429600	Short streams like 10 hours instead of 12. Mm-hmm
25430040	25437360	For me a short stream is two hours, which I think someone said that's literally what the regular stream time is for the average
25437360	25439360	Vtuber and I'm like
25439840	25443560	Two hours is me like doing stuff in the background
25443560	25446640	I'm not being funny like if I have it if you have
25447000	25450440	If you look and you see I've done a two-hour stream and nothing else that day
25450440	25453000	That means I am doing like so much work in the background
25454360	25455800	type thing
25455800	25460960	Is that these scrawny cuddles? There's only one of them in this world, baby
25463120	25468760	Time to cook through my 3k swordfish literally that's what I'm doing just getting through it
25470240	25473520	It takes her two hours just to start playing the game Lamal
25477200	25479200	Management got me there hydration chick
25482640	25484640	Wow
25486160	25488880	Hi scrawny in the most loving way possible
25488880	25494480	I want to bury my face in your butt until you pass out while you hmm yourself. You're too hot. Oh
25496320	25500680	Just your gentle talk is enough to get me going sometimes when you talk about other hot things
25500680	25505880	I need a moment to calm down. Oh my god, we've got me blushing shit
25506800	25508800	Stop
25508800	25510800	I'm glad I have that control of you
25511600	25513600	That power
25514000	25516000	Makes me very happy
25516640	25520000	Um a bit too happy. I think I take a little bit too much
25520880	25524720	Um pleasure from such a thing. Is that terrible?
25529440	25535200	Sure do have powers to arrest the boot up. What is this a Windows 95? No because I won't stop yapping
25537280	25538480	I
25538480	25542320	Love to eat sushi. I could do it for hours. Oh, yeah
25544080	25546080	Is that because I'm a cutlery?
25547760	25552480	Oh, I keep wanting to freaking make that what does your oh she smell like meme
25553440	25555040	because
25555040	25557040	the reason is
25559040	25564240	Uh, what's the reason oh because I use a lemon scented soap
25564640	25568640	I wanted to post it and be like this call fish comes pre-seasoned
25569360	25572560	Um, and then I think there's only one other girl that needs to do it
25572560	25574960	And then everyone knows what the whole velour smells like
25576800	25578800	Six thousand subscribers reached
25579840	25582720	What we celebrated 5k
25585680	25587680	Oh my gosh
25594480	25596480	Ah
25604720	25608640	What I'm really excited
25621120	25623120	Why is it getting so cold
25625040	25627040	I'm so confused. It shouldn't have been
25628720	25635760	Let's statistically yeah, it should have only been pushed to 5k people. It's bizarre. I didn't expect that at all
25639600	25642960	You have all the power over us. Take more
25644480	25646480	Thank you for the tip
25646960	25648960	rilke kadmus
25649360	25651360	Any rilke kadmus
25651440	25658560	Thank you for saying it. I'm so confused. I'm like daddy you make a tweet and be like I can't believe it but in under 24 hours
25660320	25663040	The one thing I think I've mentioned this in another stream
25664000	25668160	The one thing I do not like about being a vtuber in this context
25668800	25673120	Is you have to play the numbered games and you have to play the
25673920	25675920	Oh, thank you for this
25677920	25680320	Um in terms of like milestones
25681680	25682800	Ah
25682800	25687680	And it's a hard one to navigate because if you don't say thank you thank you
25688720	25690720	You look almost ungrateful
25691120	25692640	But if you do
25692640	25699360	Say thank you. Thank you. It looks like you're counting and waiting for the next milestone just so you can spam. Thank you. Thank you, you know
25700240	25701520	and
25701520	25703520	You don't have to say thank you
25704400	25707760	Well, the problem is I'm trying to get like
25708720	25712480	Gratisom 6k moment. Thank you little wifling. Um
25713600	25722720	The thing is like it would be really good to get on vtuber news or any kind of source like that because it brings more attention to the girls in general
25723840	25725840	which is why
25725840	25727840	it's like
25728480	25730480	I don't want people thinking i'm counting
25730640	25733360	But what i'm thinking about is the probable
25733840	25740240	Like the possibility that it could gain new eyes to the girls because I want nothing for them to succeed
25740480	25747280	I've got everything I want right here. I've got my wiflings. We're freaking meman. We've got member streams. We've got multiplayer games
25747760	25750000	Uh, we've got a smart the wazoo coming out
25750000	25755360	I've got collabs of other vtubers that are willing to interact with me like I've got everything I need
25755840	25757840	I'm so freaking happy
25757920	25761440	I want the girls to achieve their dreams and the truth of
25762080	25765680	Of them achieving their dreams is one to have enough money to be a content creator
25766160	25770800	Some of them are looking to move out. Some of them are looking for upgrade equipments on their own. Um
25772080	25778160	You know, um, emmy was fantastic. She's already designed her 2.0 model because it feels more like her
25778720	25779760	um
25779760	25786000	That kind of thing I want the girls to have it some of them wanted 3d models. I wanted them to get it and
25786960	25791120	The truth of the matter is in order to get these things
25791920	25794320	That there needs to be eyes on the girls
25794880	25798640	Um, so I can help them achieve their 3d goals and stuff
25799040	25802480	Although someone said that someone was like, what do you mean by the three year mark?
25803760	25806640	When I whenever I mentioned the three year mark
25808080	25811920	Congrats to whoever leveled up there whenever I mentioned the three year mark
25812880	25817520	The reason I say three years is because statistically three years
25818080	25822480	And you're done. You're you're persona. You're whatever you want to call it. It may be
25823600	25826800	Oh my god, you really look like emmy as well in games. Uh
25828400	25830080	The
25830080	25838240	Reason why three years is this mysterious number placed on someone's head is because that statistically if you do find success
25838240	25845600	By the third year the success goes unless you make you change your content up dramatically
25846720	25848960	and the reason I say three years is because
25850800	25857040	Remember before you like wait, so strong. He's only got three years relax. Stop doing relax. No
25858640	25868160	No, that's not it's very possible that strongy and uh, like once we're all satisfied like I won't stop until you guys
25868320	25870960	Are ready for me to stop like please don't no don't do
25871600	25877600	But please don't think I'm like just gonna abruptly stop overnight. Like that's not the reality of the situation at all
25879040	25882720	It's very likely I will want to focus on
25883520	25886160	Hypnosis audio is like way down the line
25886720	25891760	Um, it's over. No, so never no if you if you don't want me to go I'll be streaming in my little

25959680	25961200	um

25992560	25993600	We will
25993600	25997600	Strawny until we die at 99 because it's part of our little heart. Oh

26001360	26005440	Hmm deeply departed. He came and he farted
26008400	26014320	Damn you and people can't just do the same thing successfully without ever needing any variation in their content
26014400	26016560	I haven't seen examples of that before. Yes
26017520	26022480	Um, I really like the behind the scenes psychology about about at all. Um
26023440	26025440	Monster girls, please
26026000	26032880	Thank you for coming to member. Is that you asking for gen two designs to be monster girls? Oh boy. You're in for a treat
26033600	26035600	um
26036000	26037520	Yeah
26037520	26040640	There's been two designs that have been accepted
26042240	26044240	Lollilolliloll
26046160	26051680	Mods take some of his pennies and scatter them across his home wait, that's so specific
26052400	26054400	Oh, I don't know
26055920	26059280	I feel like you feel happy streaming. I can see that
26060000	26062000	Here junior. Can't imagine momy
26062560	26064400	without this
26064400	26068400	There was obviously right actually I can tell you something behind the scenes
26069280	26073520	And you're not gonna like it, but it's no longer the case because I got a script manager in
26074320	26076320	If and when gen two came around
26076720	26082080	There was no way I could keep up with the daily streaming and trying to organize all the script stuff
26082640	26086640	Um, but thank you to script master for coming into play
26087520	26089520	because without them
26090160	26095600	Being there I with with gen two starting. I probably couldn't daily stream. So
26096640	26098240	That that's the honest truth
26098240	26105840	I was going to stream my ass off for an entire year like non-stop back-to-back double streams on some days doing like endurance this endurance that
26106400	26109680	Um, but thankfully that's no longer the case. Um
26111520	26113520	Obviously
26113600	26116800	when if and when gen three were to occur
26118320	26124560	That's a lot of girls to manage and I'm not sure how realistic the daily streams will be at that point
26125520	26131200	There's my only concern and the thing is none of us have a crystal ball to look into the future
26131360	26139120	So I can't tell by zero by zero by zero every day is a blessing. No, don't cry. Don't do him. Don't do him
26139120	26143040	We're not even there. We've not even we've not even got the first model of gen two
26143600	26149600	Literally we have fucking two approved concepts. That's it. Don't burn out in spite. See that's the thing
26149760	26156960	Spite can get you very far. Maybe I will spite everyone and just say I'll stream daily and you guys weren't ready for it
26157360	26159360	It's so jovert. No
26159840	26164320	Less than six kxp for 80 million hp and I'm just telling you
26165360	26168080	That I'm from shume brap triber allegations. I've not been been
26168640	26170000	No
26170000	26175840	Stranny you're talking about the future and the game background is making me feel emotional. Okay. No. No. No. No happy happy thoughts happy thoughts
26176720	26178720	um
26178720	26183760	If you can do this and not even two weeks. I can't imagine what you're gonna do in a year
26185040	26188880	I mean, it's not really gonna change like oh, sorry
26189440	26190400	and
26190400	26192400	There's not really much like this is

26737200	26739200	The joker was a kitten
26739200	26741200	That's what food coloring is for
26742400	26747040	Didn't you get mm-hmm with all the girls at the same time in the ASMR booth with the eyes covered?

26750320	26752320	Hmm
26754240	26758880	But yeah, I've got a sea queen audio. I don't I think it'll be a donathon reward like because the girls
26759520	26764160	and are all gonna like help each other out with their donathon rewards like as uh
26765280	26767280	As I like, yeah, let's go
26769520	26773360	Sea queen, that's the only way we can that's the new saying
26773360	26775360	Um
26775360	26781120	POV all the girl velour girls are fighting over you the one human left on earth that hasn't
26781760	26783760	Decided on which girl
26784240	26787440	I thought about Icy and Emmy doing something like that
26788240	26790240	where they're fighting over
26791840	26796720	Where the ink goes or who the ink goes to um
26797440	26799440	Um
26799760	26803680	Sea queen, uh, yeah, I mean it's pretty creative. I'll give you that
26805520	26810080	Yeah, Icy and Emmy would a hundred percent fight over it, but I find it really hard
26810960	26812240	to do
26812240	26814000	that kind of
26814000	26819440	Seven five hundred swordfish and I burned two k of them. I burnt so much swordfish as well. Don't worry
26820400	26825520	Where the ink goes. Yeah, if I mean Icy ever collab like that, I would be so happy
26826800	26830160	I mean they already got a collab audio on the way um of that nature
26831360	26833920	Um, but it's a bit different. Uh
26834960	26838800	Do you want spoilers or do you not want spoilers? I don't mind doing spoilers
26840560	26845040	I think it's coming up. Is it august the collab audio start off? I think it might be
26846560	26848320	Um
26848320	26850320	It's got to be really hard to do
26850960	26854880	I want spoilers no spoilers. Oh, no you guys are split
26857040	26860160	Go hard with spoilers. Mmm
26862000	26863840	So in the plot
26863840	26869040	But close your ears if you don't want any spoilers in the plot Icy and Emmy fell out
26870400	26874400	And you the listener and you can either be a pin pal or
26875360	26879200	A snowberry wherever when you want you force them to
26881520	26883520	To make up
26884080	26885840	by
26885920	26889600	Using a massage gun to relieve their muscle tension
26890080	26893280	Because their muscle tension is the reason why they fell out
26896720	26899920	Okay, um, then me and mersey have one
26901040	26905360	Where we're uh nurses that shouldn't be qualified because of what we do
26907440	26914080	And then Azura and sheebie's one. I don't think the masses are gonna like you
26916080	26921520	I'm not gonna change it because I I like the script. I like it, but I'm not sure the masses are gonna like it
26922320	26924320	Azura and sheebie
26924320	26926320	catch you in public
26926880	26928880	um

26931520	26933520	And the m word you
26933920	26936160	And I don't know if it's gonna go down well or not
26937280	26939680	It's a very unique scenario, but please
26940560	26943360	And before you're like, oh my god, I hate it. Oh my god, stroney
26943360	26948720	I hope you die in a fire because you wrote that do you honestly think they're never gonna do another collab audio again?
26948720	26950720	Don't be so silly
26950720	26952720	It's just the first one that I gave
26953600	26959040	Yeah, it's pretty but it was pretty out there. I don't know. It's just the inspiration. I got to write for them
26959760	26962880	So I wrote it and there it was and they what?
26963680	26969440	Holy moly, that's a spicy meatball a massage gun. Yes a massage gun. I'm excited for them
26969520	26973600	It's spicy. Oh boy that one does sound very uh, yes, uh
26974800	26976800	That sounds like something
26977040	26981840	Patreon would get no, they don't um, they don't care. Um, I know what's
26982560	26987680	Uh, good to go and what's not good to go on patreon. So damn. Yeah, really pretty. Yeah
26988880	26991280	I there's a few things I wanted to cover. Um
26994960	26997440	Having the freedom to explore a bunch of
26998320	27000320	Scripts is something the scripts
27003360	27009600	Yeah, like um, it's just different things we're hitting along the way like as I said, I kind of said it from
27010720	27016000	I'm not pigeon pigeon holding any girl into a particular
27017120	27019120	category because doing so will
27019920	27026720	Limit their income source and their income source and longevity are related to their success of yellow
27027600	27031600	And I do not want to kneecap anyone. That's not fair
27033760	27039600	It is what it is you're given spicy scenarios compared to anything else. I've seen this is some top-tier content. Yes
27040160	27046400	And literally when the girls do collab audios again, they still have three other audios going out that month as well
27046480	27049360	So it's not like, you know, not everything can be for you
27050080	27052320	We live in a society of burnt fish
27052560	27054560	I
27055120	27061120	Like to try different stuff. Yeah, literally just give it a shot either you'll listen to and you'll be like this isn't for me
27061280	27063280	Or you'll be like, okay
27064080	27066080	I'm reacting smile
27066960	27073040	There's there's only two outcomes. It's either no, thank you and turn it off or I'm reacting smile
27075600	27081920	We'll get we'll all get something at some time. Yeah, basically literally everyone is cared for
27082320	27084320	It's not possible
27084320	27087600	For a creator to come out with something you love 100% of the time
27087680	27091280	It's just not possible unless they do the same thing over and over and over again
27091840	27097360	But then that is like really pigeonholing and it's it's for the success of my girlies. Okay
27098320	27100320	They gotta succeed
27100320	27104160	Or what's gonna make them want to sign there the second year of the contract, huh?
27107840	27110320	Can't wait to find out what it is. I love
27112480	27114480	Oh, I'm glad
27118640	27121120	Thanks for reading it anyway, we would
27122400	27125280	They just misspelled something and I said it wrong or something. It's okay
27126560	27129280	I'm not into feet, but I like yours. Oh, yeah
27132000	27134480	I love everything viewers done so far. Thank you
27136240	27138240	um
27138480	27140480	you know, I had a year in the making and
27141360	27146080	Just everything is falling into place so beautifully. Um, I spoke to
27146560	27149840	Oh, I'm gonna say her. I'm gonna butcher her names so badly
27150960	27152960	The Vtuber obaki
27153520	27160400	That's definitely not how you say it, but um, she was talking about a project finally coming together and
27161200	27164960	You know, I was like, oh, I can completely relate to that. So I replied to it
27165680	27172800	And I was like when the puzzle pieces finally arrive and you can start slotting them into place is so satisfying
27173520	27175200	and
27175200	27177200	And I felt that to my very core
27178560	27185280	The everything obaki pump. Yeah, it's not obaki. There's no way that's how you're supposed to say it sounds like
27185280	27188560	I'm trying to say tobacco. Obaki. Obaki
27189840	27192400	That's exactly how you say obaki. Oh, wow
27193280	27198000	No, me accidentally being smart. I can't believe it
27199440	27201440	Obaki obaki
27202960	27207120	That is the say say it first try. Oh, I'm so smart with the heck and
27208320	27214480	Yeah, she put up a tweet saying like her projects are finally coming together and I'm like, oh, I can relate to that on such a deeper level
27217680	27220240	And oh, mommy's excited to be
27221200	27227600	Five moods ahead and her main chess game. Oh, I can't wait to one be one years in chess. Actually you guys aren't ready
27229360	27232080	Tobacco is true. No, no tobacco
27234400	27239840	I can't smoke I can hardly drink to the life of me. I get one beer in me and I'm gone
27240720	27244160	That's why I wanted to do drunk apex because we can all do salt lake city
27245280	27247280	Because no one's in it other than us
27248000	27256160	Uh, I don't know what drunk game. I wanted to do drunk game, but I don't go offline until we win type of thing
27257040	27259040	But I didn't know what game to do
27262080	27266320	If I lose I get to see discord, right? What? Um
27270320	27276000	Wait, what if you lose the one be one chess you get to see the discord where we all say inappropriate stuff to each other
27277920	27279920	Say no on that one chief
27280880	27286880	I've been a lazy refland. I haven't looked at any of your daughters. Yeah, you haven't. Have you not checked any of them out?
27289120	27291120	Actually the highlight
27291360	27298080	Reels are from debut or right around the corner. I think there's one more girl that needs to be made
27300080	27304080	Um, and then the debut highlight things can be made
27304640	27309360	Um can be uploaded. I know that everyone's monetized as well
27311440	27318800	What opening do you use in chess? Uh, I call it the twat move because I don't know what what on earth is my opening move
27319920	27325520	Probably the second pawn just shove them out by two. Have a wee go
27327040	27328640	I don't know nothing about chess
27329120	27334480	All I know is that I want a one be one you guys in chess and I'll put classical music on in the background
27334800	27337840	And I'll see if I can even win against one refling
27338960	27341360	It'll be interesting to see if I can win one game
27343600	27346640	I can easily recommend girls like a shopkeeper
27348800	27350800	I have a secret conspiracy
27351120	27355920	Strony allows a small handful of fans into the discord every month or so to be groomed by the girls
27356640	27358800	Then makes them forget and kicks them out
27360240	27362240	It's actually quite funny
27362400	27366240	No, uh, I sure there absolutely nothing goes on in the discord. Um
27367120	27369120	Mercy's ASMR was a banger
27369600	27377840	No, her is her meme ASMR. No, I didn't upload it. It couldn't be her actual ASMR stream got 25 000 views, which is insane
27378800	27380800	Insane in the membrane
27381040	27385680	Can you drill my dad? I'm terrible at chess, but he plays it daily
27386000	27388240	Are you joking me? He'd like smoke me in one
27390240	27394800	You can play checkers and connect four of his people here. What in runescape?

28398320	28400320	How does this work? I don't know
28401600	28406560	This is the most confusing game. Oh, it's my turn. I didn't even see what you changed

28485280	28487280	If you are this cute when playing
28487920	28489920	Uh, I'll have that love heart solo
28490560	28494400	Corners are power spots when playing I can agree on chess and during stream

28524800	28528240	Like this does that do something? I don't know what I'm doing
28529600	28532560	I think I may I think we have to admit defeat unfortunately
28533520	28536960	Oh, I'm getting rolled everything's getting taken
28539840	28542960	I don't have the strength reflends. I'm doing so bad

28565040	28568560	Uh, but that turned green a little bit green
28571200	28578000	I guess it's like splatoon where you want everything to be your colors. Oh, that didn't do anything. Oops. I think I just threw that
28578880	28584320	You lose the board is filled. Oh, no, it was so hard. That was confusing
28585120	28591760	Uh, maybe we only do the other one. Oh, Amy wants to play. Yeah, sure. Amy will play

29009600	29011600	Can I go back?
29012640	29017280	A legal move bro. I don't even know the rule book. I don't want to get jailed
29022560	29024560	And what like this
29025760	29028320	No, I can't, can I? Maybe
29030640	29032640	I don't, wait what?
29033600	29039120	Like this, okay, that was a load. Why are some things loaded? No
29043760	29045760	Oh
29046560	29048320	Hold
29048320	29051920	In the name of the checkers board. Wait, I can't do that. Hold in the name of the check
29052080	29055840	Hold in the name of the checkers board. Hold in the name of the checkers board
29059040	29061040	What this is crazy
29063280	29068800	I'm sorry. My little brain can't do this. Maybe we just play the four in a room
29070400	29077200	You can only move one tail if you're jumping over an enemy as many times as you can. What happened? I wasn't paying attention. Oh, no
29077760	29079760	Something happened
29081040	29083840	You can only jump a tail so here
29086160	29089920	No, it's not your turn. Oh, sorry. What and then do that
29090640	29092640	What the heck
29094960	29096960	Am I accidentally winning right now?
29099280	29100640	I might be
29100640	29107920	It's plausible. Hold on. Can you go back? Oh, you can't go back. You can only go up. Okay. Wait, that didn't do anything
29111200	29113200	Can you be like gridlocked in this game?
29116400	29118400	Yes
29119280	29123840	Uh, sure go up there then. Wow. What am I doing? I can't go back
29125840	29128400	If you reach the end of the board you get knighted
29130240	29133120	Oh, neither. Oh, no, he won
29135920	29137920	I lost again
29139680	29142160	Reflames. Oh my god
29142400	29144400	Oh
29145920	29151200	No, he won I can't go back and we'll let me go back on him
29155760	29160480	Right, okay, what can I do? I can't even go forward or anything. I just did that
29161600	29166960	Game ends when all the pieces are taken. How can they be taken? We can't go backwards
29168400	29171680	I don't get it. I'm so confused. He's not won yet
29172240	29174240	What?
29178480	29183200	Wait, so if he comes here, I can only jump forward one
29187040	29189040	This is too hard
29190480	29194000	Oh, no, what happened? Something changed. I don't know
29196560	29199200	So I can't go backwards. I can only go forwards
29200080	29202080	Well, then I might as well push forward then
29203120	29205840	Surely surely that's how it works
29208720	29211040	Okay, and now then I take you
29212800	29215600	No, I can't take you you're too far away from me
29217280	29222240	Then I push you forward to play I guess
29223760	29227680	No, I don't one at a time. Sorry one move at a time. Apologies one step
29228400	29230400	Oh, this is so hard
29230640	29235840	Oh, no, my guy got taken. Wait, how do you so I can only go one way
29238240	29243040	Then that would push what that pushes him there and then I can't push up so I need to do that
29243120	29245520	Oh, no, that blocks him. Oh, I didn't mean to do that
29246480	29248480	Uh
29249600	29251600	What is a knight do I don't know
29253920	29256560	I'm not sure can he take everything now
29258640	29260640	Hmm
29260720	29262720	And then can go backwards
29264160	29267600	Oh, wait, so I just need to move him forward like here
29268720	29270720	Okay, I'll push him forward
29270720	29274880	Okay, I'll push him. Oh, he got taken right. Hold on. I'll push him forward then
29276480	29279440	Wait, am I gonna perish? I think I'm gonna perish. I don't think I can win
29280480	29282640	And then you move up. Oh, no, I didn't mean that
29283600	29285600	Yeah

31963440	31965840	Do you ever get anxiety when it comes to ending streams?
31966560	31971920	I get nervous about ending the stream because of what I'm gonna see
31972640	31978000	And I know that seems silly because it's like well you say the same every time like I say like I'll see you tomorrow
31978080	31981040	Like I love you reflings a few kisses on that
31981600	31986240	But I get worried about it and I don't know why I think it's because I am saying goodbye
31986720	31990240	And it's like I won't see you until the next time I'm up, you know
31991360	31993520	and
31993520	31995920	Too much of a grimoire you somehow groomed yourself
31997680	32001280	Hey, here at viola, you don't groom us. What are you grooming?
32002080	32004720	What I'm what a slogan to have for
32005520	32008880	Every time I do that what slogan to have for a visa reasons
32009120	32011600	I can't believe I said that out loud with my full check
32012720	32014720	Ain't that true though
32015600	32017280	Yeah
32017280	32023840	Oh when I was lurking someone mentioned that they didn't realize we both have a nicotine patch on us because we're addicted to each other
32024240	32026960	It's not for the briefings are addicted to each other. No
32027520	32029760	Refling and strongy are addicted to each other
32032640	32037760	I can always ramble and procrastinate ending streaming call those for so awkward doing so. Mmm
32039360	32043280	Well, like when we reached the 10 hour board mark on that other stream
32043360	32046880	I can't even remember what it was the entire ending got caught
32047360	32052320	But I was like trying to say so much all at once just because like I wanted to you know
32053360	32054560	and
32054560	32059440	I wasn't expected to be groomed. I'm glad you did all that sounds terrible when you write that out in a sentence
32059520	32064240	I'm going to be honest. It makes me sound like a like a Chris Hansen. Take a seat moment
32066560	32068560	Yeah
32068720	32070720	Kind of true though. Hey
32071920	32076160	I think pre-stream anxiety is normal. You're talking to an auditorium worth of people
32076640	32081760	I actually don't get nervous to stream in that sense. Um, it doesn't
32084000	32087440	I don't look at the numbers like I don't I don't actually know. Um
32088560	32094960	It's not like on display for me. It's just me and reeflings playing multiplayer game. Um
32094960	32100720	And that's it like that's what it is. It's not like I'm nervous because I'm gonna have to go perform
32101200	32108000	I don't have any kind of imposter syndrome. I don't have any kind of like I'm not good enough
32108800	32111600	Um, I just like straight up have separation anxiety
32113120	32114560	Um
32114560	32117120	And that's it pretty much. Um
32118320	32124320	Like I don't get nervous to stream. I don't get like, oh my god. What happens if they don't like it? No, um
32125520	32127120	I'm just like
32127120	32132720	Just getting out of it. I'm like, oh god. I don't feel well. Like I feel sick. Like my stomach feels ill sometimes
32134880	32138720	But like like I've started up streams and I've said to you like oh guys
32138800	32143760	It's not gonna be like a long stream today and then it ends up turning into like six hours type thing
32144480	32148000	Um, when I only had the intention of two because I wasn't feeling well
32148000	32151840	But as soon as I start streaming it's like I get a second burst of wind
32152480	32157520	Like I'm super energetic. I'm super engaged and like I'm having like so much fun
32157600	32162560	I'm enjoying myself like right now. We're looking at pixels over and over again putting
32163600	32166640	Pardon me for being so rude. It was not me. It was my food
32167680	32171840	And like I'm having so much fun. Like look at all the reeflings that are in the bank with me right now
32171920	32173760	like all of us goofing off and like uh
32174400	32176080	Mac
32176080	32178720	Macer or maker mac maker
32179440	32181440	Thank you for coming to memba
32181760	32183760	um
32184800	32186800	It's just like
32188640	32191600	It's like me with so shiny. I don't want to go out but when I'm out it's fun
32191840	32196000	Yeah, it's kind of like getting over the hump if you will and
32198240	32199760	And like
32199760	32201680	I especially
32201680	32205840	Enjoy my endurance streams. Like I kind of spoke on it the other day. Um
32206240	32207360	Um
32207360	32214080	One time I was having a really bad time and reeflings were just hanging out with me and this isn't now
32214240	32216320	This isn't now. This is like way in the past. Um
32217600	32221360	And we played a song and it's called mr. Kitty. Um
32222160	32225920	I actually like a really depressive song or kind of slow tempo song
32227040	32231680	And I heard it and I was listening to and it made me feel a certain way
32231760	32238000	It made me feel quite negative. Like it was quite a depressive song mr. Kitty after dark. Yes, that was the song
32238880	32243840	And I listened to and I typed and I said is this what you guys feel like all the time
32245440	32248480	Because of the way the song had like resonated with me
32248560	32254400	It felt as rough as I had felt in that moment because I was feeling rough because you know stuff was going on behind me. Um
32256080	32259440	And it kind of like made me realize like
32259920	32261040	Like
32261040	32264560	If me hanging out having a carry on rambling
32264960	32271040	Coming up with all these like silly little ASMR ideas and like all these collab ideas and elaborate stuff and all of that
32271520	32277440	And like it makes you not feel like that when I stream like how blessed and how lucky
32278080	32280400	like we're on this timeline like
32281760	32283760	You know, you can feel
32284640	32287920	I don't like accepted to just like do your own thing
32288000	32294480	Like I always say the phrase you can be at arm's length. You can be attached at the hip. You can be on my head type thing
32294480	32297040	It's completely up to you V Flynn. Um
32298400	32302400	But I do remember that night because I was like you guys feel like that like when
32303440	32306720	Just in general like you have like such a rough time and then you come
32307680	32314400	On stream and like you come and you you make me laugh. You make me giggle. We tell terrible puns while going
32315200	32316480	like
32316480	32318560	And we're just hanging out type thing
32318560	32321520	You know it was like even when like you feel so rough
32321680	32328880	You're so willing to like come to me be so accepting of me like say such nice things to me and encourage me to do stuff
32329840	32334880	Um and all of that and it's just like it's such like a nice way like hopefully
32335360	32339600	I hope it's like a positive feedback loop where you make me giggle
32339840	32344800	I make you giggle and like we just have a fun time for what it's worth. Um
32346800	32349360	Sometimes you need a song like that to marinate in your thought
32349520	32355360	Yeah, like I don't listen to what I consider like sad music in the dumps music or emotional music
32355600	32360240	Like I listen to atarashi gako. Um, and like tokyo calling
32360880	32364000	Tokyo calling. Um, like I listen to hatsu and miki
32364000	32366880	I don't even know what's happening half the time when I listen to hatsu and miki
32367200	32373200	But like the music's so upbeat it's so up-pop like I never listen to anything depressive like I like goofy
32374080	32380320	Um, like literally I'm listening to a dutch song. I have no idea what's being said other than the lyrics suck my
32381520	32383360	um
32383360	32385360	type thing, you know
32385360	32387360	What was I saying?
32388480	32395120	Thanks for the stream strutting. I'm off to watch mercy. Yes. Um any snippets mercy modiste is live and she
32396000	32401040	Is playing with my willy. Uh, she's not. Um, maybe in another life
32402320	32404320	Um
32404720	32409760	Thank god no each one. Uh, right hold on. Let me check hatsu miki has become a legendary figure
32410640	32414240	Of making a homework right. Hold on. What is mercy playing?
32414880	32419920	Is zura still alive? Azura is still alive. She's playing stream live
32420720	32424880	Uh, mercy modiste. Uh, mercy is playing harvester
32426160	32429520	Part two. I already knew that because I said that earlier and yet I forgot
32430160	32432160	See you brain
32432160	32434160	See you brain
32434880	32436880	Uh
32440000	32443840	I got a comment on the new the asmr video
32445920	32448400	And someone's like why is this being recommended to me?
32450080	32454480	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you can't resist the asmr
32459680	32462720	The most I felt like that after dark was when that
32462800	32464800	Um
32465120	32471520	When you go in member to a members world, I don't know if we need to do a members world this stream
32471600	32474720	It may be next stream. We're doing members world unfortunately
32476160	32477920	although
32477920	32479920	Wine isn't members is it?
32480640	32484000	No, maybe not. I don't know if we're just doing members all the way to the end
32484880	32488480	It if we're doing wines all the way to the end people say wines is faster
32489440	32495440	I literally get algorithmed. Honestly. What did you miss? I stuffed my face and then
32496720	32498720	Let uh
32499840	32503280	Let the architect bros know I've got them in the back of my mind
32508080	32511280	Um, yeah, hold on. Hold on
32513280	32517200	The begging ASMR is peak ASMR. Honestly. Wait, what does it say now?
32518480	32523680	It's still going. Oh my god. Is that 23,000 views?
32525200	32527200	That doesn't make sense
32528000	32534640	Architect bros eating good just like strongy. Honestly. What does it mean architect architect is a
32535520	32538160	terminology used for people who enjoy
32539040	32544160	bigger body types or eating type of content
32545120	32550400	Or gaining weight type of content, but there's different levels to it
32551120	32557920	Um, so Azura delays body type because she's not like the default skinny malinky
32558000	32562960	I keep opening this freaking collection box. Um, VTuber, so
32564720	32567760	She would get referred to as someone for the architect
32568320	32570320	Bros
32570640	32574560	Look at all the swordfish. They're so purple
32576400	32578400	Why are you so purple?
32579680	32581680	A
32583520	32585520	Specifically vtubers, I think
32587040	32589040	She shuffled herself and then
32590320	32594640	Yes, uh, again Azura duly is live with a stream
32595520	32601280	Hopefully her pc doesn't explode. Um, and merci mondice is playing harvester part two
32601600	32607120	Which she never told me there was a part two because I'm getting a highlight reel of part one
32608000	32611120	Which isn't going to make any sense if I don't get highlight reel apart
32615760	32620160	I love strongy. I love reeflings. What are you going to do about it? Huh? You're going to kiss me on my lips
32621120	32623120	You know, let me hold your hand
32623520	32625520	Actually, I have something to ask
32625920	32627920	The reeflings are
32628160	32632160	You guys are like small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. Basically
32633280	32635440	Do you guys like that you're smaller than me?
32636800	32638800	Or would you like
32639280	32645520	A mascot that's like bigger. Oh my god. Why am I struggling so hard with this bank system?
32646960	32650640	Um, like you're so nice and tame. Yeah smaller than you is better
32651360	32658400	What is my size? Um, I don't even think I have a reference artwork. I can use that isn't toss breaking
32660800	32661600	Small is nice
32661600	32667360	Yes, you're if you didn't know secret hidden lore for the reeflings your tentacles can grow as long as you like
32667360	32669840	So you can interact with things as much as you need
32670480	32675680	Um, you have very very long tentacles if you so desire, but they're just nice and cute and stacked together
32675760	32682720	Whilst you are in oh my god the crisscross salmon the salmon are going upstream look they're going upstream
32687920	32693280	We are growers not sure it's exactly hmm almost like a previous lore strange
32694320	32699940	It small means when you cuddle as we feel you every yeah, I can put you in my mouth in my tummy
32700340	32702340	Yeah
32703940	32712020	Uh, we can go explore strony in the first sense. Hmm should I blindfold reeflings but let your tentacles do what they want?
32714580	32716580	Bank boost I'm not going to mess it up this time
32718900	32720900	Wow
32722660	32728740	Oh, wow, how do I do the fire? Huh? Okay, there we go
32730580	32735780	Strony subtly mentioned war. I don't mind it. No, I clearly I like giant ass like war
32737220	32739220	um
32740660	32742660	What else I like
32743860	32745860	Um
32747220	32750660	Try to think of other things that are considered like not regular
32753780	32756420	Hmm spelunking me no
32757380	32759380	Oh
32759780	32761780	I can't escape that word
32762580	32767860	It's like mongolian throat singing. It's everywhere. It's everywhere. Can't escape it
32768980	32770980	No spelunking
32771220	32773220	What does it even mean?
32774500	32781220	You cannae tell me it's not related to the bedroom spelunking. I can't wait to go spelunking with the reeflings
32782180	32785780	Oh, I can't wait until we go into a tight dark
32786900	32788500	damp
32788500	32795220	Cave and spelunk together like bro. Whoever named spelunking spelunking you knew exactly what you did
32796900	32799220	I mean cave exploring. Yeah
32801300	32803300	I literally
32804420	32809860	You've ever heard such a more ridiculous word. How dare they make such a word
32811300	32813460	Oh my god, you're still doing absolutely
32815060	32817060	Wakey wakey sleepyhead
32818260	32825620	Goodnight Strony send luck to my country tomorrow. I have no idea what your country's doing tomorrow, but please don't perish if it's bad
32828020	32830020	Good luck to your country
32830180	32835220	And rest well for anyone who do need to sleep. Please don't worry. We are literally just
32835940	32839300	going for another three hours and then
32841540	32842900	Uh
32842900	32847380	We'll redirect into a streamer. I don't know who I don't even know who's not online normally at this time
32848100	32852260	Uh, but we will find a vtuber that is live that we can redirect into
32853060	32859780	The euro cup fitba is on the new all right. Okay, right. Good luck. Uh, I am down for some spelunking right now
32860500	32867220	Uh, plunging is another fun one plunging. Please don't plunge me. That's not abysmal
32867460	32869460	Hmm
32869700	32871700	Spelunking in the cave of a giant ass
32872500	32876500	I don't know how to have far to go with the giant ass and the zero
32876580	32880420	I might not make her do the weird side of things. I may do the weird side of things
32884500	32886500	But yeah
32890020	32892660	No, no plunging not even a little
32893380	32900100	You can plug me up. Whoa. Wait, hold on. I was like so direct. My brain was like, oh
32900820	32908260	This'll this is fine. This is clearly beating around the bush. Nope. No, it's not. It's absolutely not. I just straight upset what
32909140	32911140	what I uh
32912100	32916260	Sorry, you know, actually I can tell you something that was really terrible
32916260	32922340	So if all the development issues hadn't occurred, I actually
32923220	32924420	fully
32924420	32926420	was going to
32928740	32929620	Are you squinting me?
32929620	32934420	Uh, hold on. I don't know what you think. Giant ass for content one day totally
32934980	32936980	Ah
32937140	32942340	I'm freaking happy to make it anonymous. It doesn't bother me. Like I like it. I don't mind at all. Um
32943300	32946180	I don't like the you die ones. I don't like that
32946340	32950260	I like the ones where you just kind of appear on the other end all fine and good
32950420	32953860	And maybe a bit moody because you accidentally got swallowed or something like that
32954660	32956100	um
32956100	32958500	She's letting the intrusive thoughts went honestly though
32959140	32966260	This is terrible. So if all the development issues didn't happen all the girls were posting like all these audios on twitter and I was like
32966900	32972420	Uh, I should probably do one as well. But like after debut and I thought wouldn't it not be really
32973460	32975300	terrible if
32975300	32977300	I may or may not have been
32979860	32981860	PLug
32982500	32988260	Uh during like debut and after and then once the stream ended I would go record
32988900	32994980	and like do something with it and then finish and then post it and you know
32995540	33000020	So that was my idea. But obviously that all crumbled apart. Thanks to development issues. Um
33001940	33003940	But yeah, I thought it would be pretty cute
33005060	33006260	But
33006260	33010580	That would have been amazing. Unfortunately. It's not possible. It's not possible
33011540	33016340	And there was so many developmental issues in time and I could absolutely strangle some people
33016420	33018420	But that's just what happens like literally
33019140	33023780	Um, oh, sorry. There was a refling that messaged me that apologized for
33024500	33027540	criticizing the company for saying like, oh, it'd be better if
33028340	33035940	The girls could make their designs. Please don't feel bad. I absolutely completely get where you come from. Um,
33036500	33037620	just for
33037620	33039620	How do I keep doing that?
33039620	33041620	I give up. Um
33041700	33048100	Please don't feel bad about saying that like you said it in a nice way. We had some negative criticism that was like
33048580	33052820	Oh pre-made model. Actually one of the most bizarre criticisms we got
33053460	33055460	um was
33056100	33060100	What was it? It was like, oh, they don't even have talents ready
33060740	33064500	When we opened up auditions and it was like, yeah, you're fucking Egypt
33064740	33068340	We didn't have talents. So we're opening auditions like every other Vtuber agency
33068580	33070020	But when we do it, it's bad
33070020	33072900	But when everyone else does it, it's fine and that was like, what?
33073540	33076740	It was the most bizarre thing I had ever read honestly
33078340	33080340	um
33080420	33088020	We have plenty of time for a future fun. Well, literally opened up auditions and someone was like, what if she'd be 2.0 look like this?
33089300	33092180	I mean, she's getting an update to our model. I don't know how much she's said
33092260	33095540	I'm not gonna say anything if she doesn't say anything. I'm not gonna say anything
33096020	33099860	Thank you for the tip as well anonymous. Sorry. I almost forget to thank you
33101300	33104820	Um, I won't say anything until she be says something but
33105220	33107220	Yeah
33108420	33110420	Outfit she said outfit
33114500	33119540	Right, I'll I'll leave it at that if she's not directly said what it is. I'm not gonna say
33120580	33122580	She said outfit
33125140	33129620	Uh, we don't have workers because we're not open yet many baffled honestly
33130260	33134900	It was bizarre like I remember reading it actually there's a reflin
33135380	33137380	It must have been a reflin
33137460	33141300	It must have been a reflin because you made me he haul my arse off
33142100	33146660	And I can remember the quote because I used to quote it because someone defended the agency
33147060	33151220	They must I think they're a reflin or possibly just someone who's enthusiastic about the girls in general
33151780	33154820	So someone criticized the company because they were like
33155540	33157220	Oh
33157220	33163140	Another agency where you have to give up your model to work with them and get their their pre-made models or whatever
33163780	33167140	And then someone commented and replied to them and there was like
33167860	33173300	No one wants your ugly as sin model like that was to the quote your ugly as sin model
33173940	33175300	Oh
33175300	33178900	I wish I could have interacted with it because it made me he
33179460	33184100	Ha so badly is that no one wants your ugly as sin model
33184900	33186900	Oh, my god
33187220	33188020	I
33188020	33195220	Literally was like getting so close to printing that out and putting it on my fridge because it was just so hilarious to me
33195300	33197300	Like it was so hilarious
33198020	33200020	um
33200020	33202020	Like I just oh my god
33203140	33205140	um
33205140	33211460	It vin miss vin san vin san vin sin vin sin
33212420	33216580	Vincent thank you for becoming a member that took me so long to figure out. I'm so sorry
33217140	33219140	No, not sin sister
33219140	33222100	It was just the terminology the guy used because someone was like
33222500	33228260	Oh, I don't want to give up my model type thing and I don't want this. I don't want that like basically complaining about the agency
33228260	33231140	And it was like rub one you've not even applied to you're not interested
33231140	33237060	So three shut the fuck up and then some reflin or just someone who was a good fan come swooping in
33237540	33243140	And replies what I was basically thinking no one wants your ugliest sin model and I'm like
33243940	33245940	It's so good
33246100	33253060	It's so funny. Anyway, so you made my day whoever whoever like came swooping under to defend the agency you have made my day
33253140	33254020	um
33254020	33261300	Hellscape. Thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate it the membership stream start next week. Uh, you've got plenty
33262260	33267060	Uh, it's a bit warm not gonna lie a bit hot in here. Yeah, but it's a bit sweaty out here
33267620	33269940	Surprise the bank hasn't caught on fire. Honestly
33270980	33272420	um
33272420	33275700	Forgive her. She's tired and forgot how to read. Oh, no, what did I miss me?
33276260	33278500	Oh, what are you yapping about strongy? She be cooking
33279380	33284260	So I think she be has allured to something which I'm more than happy for her to
33284980	33290020	Um, but I don't think she's fully said what it is and I don't want to ruin it because it's quite a nice thing
33290100	33294340	I think it's quite a nice thing and it's like the most basic common courtesy thing. Um
33295380	33297380	Allured she be alert to it
33298820	33300820	There were some abysmally
33301540	33303540	stupid takes on a flume
33304980	33308020	It's just the way the guy typed the message
33309460	33315060	I just constantly remember the phrase ugly as sin model. I was like, oh my god
33315860	33324180	Talk about like catching screwy like oh my god. I don't think I could recover if someone was like your ugliest sin model
33327060	33329860	Oh my god, love it. Love it. Love it. Love it
33331780	33337700	Then mummy you have broken youtube. We are going for 6.1 subs. Oh my god
33339220	33341860	The video was the video honestly that funny
33342340	33347220	I'm like, I'm second guessing myself. I'm like, what's the video truly that entertaining
33347220	33351780	Like I was just kind of seen please a lot by the end of it and started like breathing in the mic really weird
33352980	33356900	I only know one agency that lets their talents pick their models literally
33357940	33360420	I've only heard one other agency do it as well
33361380	33363380	um
33363380	33368900	But I'm quite happy for the girls like to design their 2.0 like emmy designed her 2.0 like I'm more than happy
33368900	33373780	If she wants that makes her happier and all that then juice. What am I gonna fucking say about it? Nothing
33374500	33376980	Oh guys as long as the girls are happy. They're happy. Um
33378260	33380260	I made mommy ink herself
33380260	33383220	Has my whole life been a mistake. Is this peak content for you from?
33384740	33389300	Uh, also the amount of people that could not read. Oh, I felt so bad
33390100	33392980	Actually, we had one japanese girl
33393380	33396100	Um apply and I felt so bad
33396580	33398580	Because she had such a lovely voice
33398660	33404820	But she could hardly speak any english and I was like, it's not gonna work. It's such a shame
33405540	33408420	She had worked for a previous agency
33409060	33411060	um
33411060	33418100	And I think google translate was helping her through the page and she inquired on the website and I felt so bad being like
33418980	33422660	Bro, you can't speak english. I can't have you there was actually a russian
33423300	33428900	Person that reached out as well. She was like, I know you I know your agency's english
33429140	33433060	But can I stream in russian and have a russian audience and I'm like
33433700	33441060	Ah, yes, let us the english vtuber agency come out with talents that where I can't even like moderate what you're doing or saying like
33441220	33442420	what
33442420	33445860	Some folk had like don't get me wrong. We're lenient, but
33446820	33449460	We do have to say like that's not even possible
33450180	33452980	Like what you're asking for isn't even possible
33454180	33455860	um
33455860	33462180	It was a shame. I loved emi's 2.0 design. I'm glad. I'm glad. I think she had a lot of fun design in her 2.0
33463220	33464340	um
33464340	33466340	so, yeah
33466740	33469620	How good was good as application? What?
33470580	33477460	Good is still a thingy. Oh, you want to trade with me? Hold on. Let me put my swordfish away. I'll trade with you. What's up?
33478340	33480340	What's up low leaflin?
33482180	33485220	Uh, maybe oh, it's so what is this?
33486980	33488980	Are these doughnuts to put around your
33490580	33495620	disc of returning disc of returning yellow boots yellow gloves. What?
33495620	33497620	Huh?
33497940	33499940	What have you given me? What does it look like?
33500420	33502660	activity
33502660	33504660	You can only enter
33504660	33507780	Thor dors black hole from the dwarven mains
33508980	33513860	Are you sitting literally? I thought this is a weebie ring as well. Are you giving me your weebie ring?
33515380	33517380	Am I putting shoes on?
33518020	33520020	Okay, I got shoes on
33520020	33522020	I got gloves on
33522340	33529300	Oh, now I look like I really work. I think it's a helpful tool that'll come in handy later. That's so ominous
33529860	33532580	This is a helpful tool that'll help you later. What do you mean?
33533380	33536020	That's so ominous. What am I supposed to do about that?
33540180	33541460	I
33541460	33544100	Get you miss 100% of the shots, but some people
33544980	33550180	Just don't get it. It was a shame like I felt really bad for the Japanese girl
33550180	33552900	She was nothing but polite well mannered
33553940	33556260	Um, and like obviously I can't say too much of the message
33556260	33560180	But basically she'd worked in another agency before it didn't work out
33560820	33566740	Um, and she was like really excited at the prospect and she already had all the experience type thing
33567460	33570500	But she just couldn't speak English and I can't be like
33571540	33577860	Given lead script examples where she mimics what I'm saying because then she's gonna end up just sounding like me type thing
33577860	33583220	When it comes to trying to mix it was a shame. It was a shame because it would have been a very interesting mix
33587860	33593460	You can stack donuts on it Japanese branch went no, there will be no spin-offs
33594580	33596980	absolutely no spin-offs that feel or
33598100	33599380	um
33599380	33606580	I am I am three gens and I am done. I have nothing else to produce or give to this beautiful world
33606740	33608740	I will give my daughters
33609060	33610580	um
33610580	33616980	My gen one my gen two my gen three and I am done. I cannot handle anymore. I am I'm at capacity
33617380	33619380	There is too much lights off
33619540	33623620	Plappening happen. I can't keep up with you as refluence. I can't keep up with you
33624340	33625300	um
33625300	33630580	Someone was worried about a male branch. I assure you that male branch idea is dead in the ditch
33630660	33632660	I am not even touching it with a 10-foot pole
33633940	33635940	um
33636580	33639140	Someone asked I did get a few inquiries
33639700	33644500	On the website saying are you interested in doing a safer work branch?
33645220	33647220	The answer is no
33647700	33650020	I don't mean to sound so blunt with that
33650980	33651940	But the answer is no
33651940	33657700	You might as well go to any other agency go apply to any other agency if you're if you're interested in the safer work
33657860	33661620	The reason why you don't get such a good cut in other agencies is because they're greedy cons
33661620	33665060	But that's okay though because you know is what it is and they point and
33665940	33667940	They point and beat around the bush
33667940	33669940	They point and beat around the bush
33670740	33672100	and
33672100	33678100	Safer work branch kind of defeats the purpose literally like at that point might as well just start like
33679540	33683060	A whole different agency and all that jazz
33685220	33690020	But I am done. I have experienced it. It's been fun
33690580	33694740	Um Vila is my child and so are my daughters
33695380	33700020	And the reeflings are the father and I'm also pregnant with the reeflings for that asmr
33700180	33702580	And I forgot to commission that art. I've still not done it
33704660	33706660	Vila to electric boogaloo
33707460	33711140	But strongy with enough power you can reignite even a dying star
33712820	33716340	No latin american branch. No, I cannot do any
33717300	33723540	Uh alternative language speaking branches because I don't speak the language and I
33724740	33730580	Don't have any trusted advisors that I could overwhelm with the amount of work it takes
33731060	33732340	um
33732340	33738900	Like the split couldn't be as high if I needed someone on call 24 7 to translate what these girls are trying to
33739380	33742820	Say to me like it's just it's not possible. It's not possible
33743380	33747620	Or it's not possible for me possible for other agencies. Not yourself out, but
33748180	33753860	After three gents. I am done. I am helping the girls achieve their dreams as much as possible at that point
33753940	33755940	I have no interested in
33756340	33764740	Trying to infinitely expand and have a billion talents out of ones and no, that's just no it's so disrespectful as well to the
33765620	33770820	To the girls um just being like oh, but we're already throwing out the next gen some mailers
33770980	33776660	I'm broke. Oh, wait. Sorry. Sorry. Refling was trade. I'm sorry. Refling. Hold on. Let me trade. Let me put this away

34097620	34102420	When the stream ends emi and ac's memberships are gonna go
34102900	34110500	Live because I'm gonna put them live because I'm such a good little streamer
34112740	34114740	Such a good little streamer
34115780	34118100	It's dreamer. No, let me be a streamer
34119780	34121780	Manager, no, I'm a little manager
34122420	34129140	I just do the intern work and it keeps the stress off of them as long as the girl stress levels are low
34130020	34132420	And I will I will be very happy
34139700	34146180	The point is to consume hypno content so much it conditions you it will work eventually to me over a decade from when I
34146420	34148980	became interested in color felt my first return
34151780	34153780	It was drowsy
34154740	34158740	Yeah, I will my bed team is
34159460	34165220	5 p.m. Actually, it's 1 p.m. Right now and we've still got another
34166580	34168580	Two and a half hours. Yeah
34170740	34172740	So then that would take me to
34174420	34178020	4 p.m. So I have one hour basically to do all the
34178660	34183300	Stuff that I'm supposed to do. Um, and then I pass out
34183780	34188340	And then when I wake up I prepare for stream with a cup of honey tea
34188740	34193780	And then I open up crash bandicoot warped and make sure you guys can hear it and see it
34194340	34201780	And then we go again. Um, I believe tomorrow is eight hour stream. It's not endurance to finish the game. It's eight hours
34204100	34207140	Would it be mean to let you know you're 10% of the way to 99?
34207140	34209140	I
34212740	34214740	What
34216340	34218340	10% of the way
34220580	34224500	I thought I could get it finished this month. I don't think so
34228420	34230420	10% there. Oh, yay
34233700	34236020	Do you want to know the amount of xp required?
34237620	34239620	It's 13 million. Oh, I'm
34240900	34245860	10% of the way that so every million is like, I guess
34247620	34251460	Well, 1.3% is every million wait
34252500	34254500	Every million is 10.3%
34256020	34259060	Surely that's how it works. Is that how math works?
34261700	34263700	Break it down into chunks. Um
34264420	34269780	9 to 8 to 99 is like 1.2 million. Oh my god
34271220	34275860	Peanut the force is here. You should be able to do it
34278020	34282900	Every 1.3 million is 10% okay, so we're just over 10% now
34283700	34288100	Okay, that's not bad. We'll finish the sword fish
34288740	34292820	I think we can finish the sword fish before the end of the stream and then
34293940	34298980	We'll tackle wine. I'm going to buy a bunch of wine stuff
34299620	34302740	And we're basically gonna watch a movie
34304980	34308420	While we do it so we can all giggle and laugh at movie
34309300	34311540	Um, I think we'll do john wick
34312980	34316100	This is perfect zatsu content and rambling. Yeah
34316980	34321380	I did look at marshmallow. I don't know if I have many more marshmallows a lot of the marshmallows
34321380	34325380	I can't really read for obvious reason because reeflings are a little
34327940	34330180	Okay, let me check if there are any more
34331460	34333460	Marchmallows
34333460	34337620	Oh, okay, definitely a few more marshmallows. Hold on. Let's go. Uh
34341220	34344740	Oh, no, are you guys berating me because I lost four in a row?
34348900	34350900	Uh
34352340	34354340	Uh
34356100	34358820	I was split between giving my veal or membership
34360260	34362760	Cherry to emmy or to mercy
34363460	34368180	Because each of the girls are intense young dairies and don't want their fans to flirt with other girls
34368660	34373700	Then I remembered all the good times from hanging in your stream and I saw the third option you me
34373940	34376180	No, you're supposed to support my daughters
34376740	34382100	Strong eat sometimes during or after emmy's membership opening. I'm going to make a decision. You're a strong prick
34382260	34384260	I won't overlook you when deciding
34384420	34388740	Reefling or or pinpal or snippet whatever one you may be
34389300	34393860	Um, please always support my daughters over me if you can only support one at a time
34394500	34402100	Um, please pick either daughter if you struggle to pick between a daughter pick the design the default design
34402180	34403860	You like the most
34403860	34408180	That's the easiest the most simplistic way to do it because your brain will either go
34408340	34412020	I like this design the most or I like that. Oh my god. I thought Gimli was in the room there
34412420	34416340	I had a heart attack. I was getting nervous about spiders. Uh, I don't like them
34416740	34423860	Um, I'm also just a spider like a working in the room. Can we add pictures or videos to marshmallows? Um, you can via
34424660	34426660	cat box
34426900	34428660	um
34428660	34433620	If you want to show me something you have to do the link and you have to make it easy
34434340	34436340	Just remove the dot
34436500	34441300	And put dot in brackets because if you do it any other way, I'm too paprika and can't open it off
34441380	34444820	It's literally a logic puzzle to open up a link when you don't give me the link
34446660	34452660	It's okay strongy. We'll comfort you after this losses. They're there head pads. Good girl. Hey, wait didn't
34453460	34456660	Did you want us to help with those frustrations? Would you like to be on?
34456740	34460900	Whoa, I can't read that. Whoa, I can't read that
34467060	34469060	Okay
34471860	34476020	Can you read that in lads can you read that in? Hey, that's uh, that's the offline
34476740	34480100	That's the offline one. You know what I'm saying? That's that's that's between me and offline
34481860	34484180	Uh, right. Let me let me scroll down to the next one
34485140	34488740	Hey strongy, just wanted to thank for all the fun streams. You're welcome. We've been
34489380	34495060	I've especially enjoyed your ASMR streams. Your voice and accent are just so pleasant to listen to. I you like that
34495140	34497140	I bet you do
34497460	34500500	I also look forward to the fun ways that you plan to mind break it. Oh
34501380	34503380	It's coming
34503460	34507140	Hope you and the girls are having a great time and go far with your content
34507220	34510420	Bruv, we're all in cloud nine like all of us are so happy
34510980	34515300	Um our monetization streams are about to be done me and mercy are done
34515940	34520260	Icy and emmy are next then it's she be
34520900	34524420	Then it should be a zero whenever it gets granted. I feel like it should happen now
34524740	34531860	I'm sorry strongy, but I choose you. You speak to me on a whole another level. I love you. Kamiyoshi. No, you can't call me kamiyoshi
34534660	34539540	Will you do more twitter mosaic responses to the marshmallows? Yes, I've been wanting to do it
34540020	34543940	And update it terribly terribly badly for a long time
34544180	34549220	Because I really enjoy writing the scenarios to you guys like when you guys give me like a little prompt or something
34549700	34552980	And I just take it way too far. It's my favorite thing to do
34555140	34558420	Yes, I will definitely be doing that again soon. It's just
34559140	34565780	Every I say this every stream as the dust settles and all the little mini side projects get pushed out the way
34566020	34570660	Then I can start to like really catch up because like whenever I do those two-hour streams
34570900	34577380	I'm catching up and like I'm literally going to the doctors after buckshot roulette and then I'll be healing up for a bit
34578180	34580180	um
34580580	34582180	so
34582180	34588420	ASMR with the viewer viewer beats you in a board game a bunch till we let you win and so then
34588580	34591780	Spacey time to celebrate the victory. Honestly, that's quite funny
34592660	34594660	um
34595620	34600740	You being so silly not very bright and cute at the same time makes me want to
34602340	34604660	Run and tackle you under the bed and cuddle you
34605940	34610180	I would hug you and roll around under the covers and never let you go. Where's can I explain how much I love you?
34610180	34612180	You're my sunshine. Oh, you're my sunshine
34613380	34615380	Refling
34615380	34617380	You like when I'm dumb
34618100	34622180	You like when I show how unbelievably brain dead I am. Yeah, is that what you like?
34625620	34628740	Sorry, but you're being hard locked as my oh, she does
34630660	34632660	We sure do
34633460	34636500	Allegedly, why is it so hard to play fricking connect for?
34638740	34640740	I don't know why it's so hard
34643220	34648580	Uh she be just woke up and said I woke up a bit ago dizzy but wanting to be ravaged
34648900	34651380	Okay, she be she be doing better with her migraine
34651380	34658660	You are more of a mother to me than my own parents and I hardly even know you you are welcome
34658900	34661220	well, I didn't mean you're welcome like that, but
34662180	34664180	um
34664180	34666180	sometimes
34666500	34675300	It's a bit sucky, but some people might not necessarily be the best parents and sometimes it's easier to just
34676660	34678660	take a deep breath
34678660	34680660	and sigh and say
34681060	34683460	They did the best with what they had
34684340	34686340	at the time with what they got
34687060	34688420	and
34688420	34693860	Sometimes it's not easy to swallow the truth and be like, oh that really wasn't as
34694580	34696420	nice because
34696420	34702740	You know when you watch media, it's like oh the loving parents. They're so supportive. They're so this or so that
34703700	34710500	Sometimes it's a hard pill to swallow to say that you drew an unlucky hand
34711060	34717540	And that might not necessarily mean you don't still share a love for your primary caregivers
34718180	34719140	um
34719140	34726740	But there are some phrases in the english language that's like the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb
34727700	34732020	Which basically just means the connections that you seek out in life
34732740	34734740	that are
34734820	34736820	outside of your family
34737620	34740980	Can be just as valid if not more loving
34741540	34746660	than family because you don't pick family you don't you don't pick these aspects and
34747700	34749700	sometimes it's just easier to
34751140	34756340	It's not easy to swallow the pill, but sometimes it's easier to just take a deep breath
34757220	34759780	Let out a big sigh and be like okay
34760660	34762660	That's just how it is and
34763620	34765620	I hope you're doing okay. Yeah
34765780	34767140	is
34767140	34769140	It sucks, but i'm i'm glad um
34770340	34773380	You can feel a degree of motherly love. Um
34774580	34777140	You know, I don't think anyone should be embarrassed or
34778180	34783140	Uh, what's the word kind of like it's only human nature to crave
34783620	34784580	um
34784580	34789380	to crave attention to crave love to create to crave
34789940	34791940	These positive reinforcers
34792900	34797700	That show that you're a part of a community that you're welcome that you're wanted
34797860	34800980	So don't ever you know, don't feel embarrassed about that
34801460	34805780	Just you know, if you're needing kind of a way to to put it away
34806260	34810180	Uh deep down inside you just want like one big sigh and say
34810980	34817220	Yeah, you know what that's fucked that situation's fucked, but i'm here. I'm doing it. I'm crushing life
34817460	34819460	You know, i've gotten through
34819460	34825380	The worst days of my life every every worst day of every experience yet. You're still here and you're still

34841460	34843460	Um
34843860	34850020	Will you for lack of better words recycle scripts with slight adjustments for the other girls?
34850660	34856980	I no longer am the script master, but the answer is no they're all being like created from scratch
34857700	34858340	um

35164420	35167060	however, uh, the exception is that a
35167460	35173140	The stupid sentence I've heard is a love yourself first before you love someone else or something like that. Shut the fuck up
35173140	35176740	That's the most nonsense statement I've ever heard. Everyone can share the love to any degree
35177700	35179700	That's my take on that sense. Um
35181780	35186980	You can share love at any point it is simple to share a little bit of love glasses
35187700	35191460	toggle no not glasses toggle I never got glasses on my model
35192100	35194100	Uh
35194420	35198500	This is helping me procrastinate my final. How do you oh no
35199620	35203940	That's not good. Damn. I fell asleep for 13 hours and you're still screaming. Yeah
35204660	35206660	Do you need iron supplements?
35208820	35210820	Sleeping for 13 hours
35211060	35217220	Indicates low iron. You might want to get that checked out or just start taking iron supplements. Go for it. Have fun
35218020	35220020	You can only take one dose a day anyway
35220980	35227220	Cooking was my first 99 in old school runescape. Are you gonna end up making wine? It's expensive, but the fastest
35227220	35229860	Yes, we are doing wine. I stopped doing wine
35230420	35233620	Reflings gave me a ton of fish. So I'm cooking all the fish first
35234180	35235140	Wine
35235140	35239300	It requires a lot of focus like I keep missing the fermentation
35239780	35241780	period for an xp bomb
35242100	35244100	and
35244420	35246420	I used to sleep when giving a ton of blood
35247060	35251860	And they said I had high iron. Oh, I don't know what high iron would be. How much red meat do you eat?
35252740	35254660	I didn't actually sleep
35254660	35258740	You just still streamed for such a long time. Oh, okay. I comprehend. I understand
35260100	35261700	Comprehendi
35261700	35263700	It's just sweet. Comprehendi
35264580	35266580	Drink less blood. Are you a vampire?
35268260	35272580	If you want the truth anything that might take you away from us
35272740	35277380	Makes me want to cry, but I'm not going what can take me away from you
35278180	35280180	Motherfucker. I am veiler
35281460	35285220	Nothing can stop me other than an internet connection. That's about it
35285860	35288260	You know, you don't have to worry about me going anywhere. Nothing
35288980	35293300	Nothing can perish me and we already know what we say to death. We say to death not today motherfucker
35293460	35299140	I've got refluence. Okay, and they've got me and we've got a lot. We've got a lot of time to make up for okay
35300260	35301780	um

35307780	35309780	Don't panic stop panicking
35313300	35321780	The deadly tone fiction do you know how that's how bob marley passed away apparently he rejected penicillin because of his beliefs
35322260	35327780	And bob marley that this is love this is love this is love that's that feeling
35328420	35332420	That singer passed away because he rejected penicillin
35334660	35337140	Why do I keep opening that? I don't even know how I'm doing that
35338420	35340020	um
35340020	35344580	Yeah, like saws i'm snorting penicillin for free like you don't have to tell me twice if I need it
35345860	35351220	Advantage a modern modern tag and doesn't pay it bro. She's gonna reject pen- no i'm not
35351780	35353940	Other than my dad's allergic to penicillin
35354820	35356820	um
35357460	35359460	you
35359780	35362260	Mummy I need a countdown. Please let me in
35362660	35368500	Uh, I don't know if you're on the patreon, but there's a new patreon audio with that in it
35369540	35371940	Unending stamina. Good. I didn't try that
35372820	35375140	Uh, yeah, I was freaking I was
35376100	35378020	clapping
35378020	35382820	I was clapping without my hands asmr and then right at the end of it. I was like, oh
35383140	35385540	I was a little cheeky cat there might as well
35386180	35391380	I'm allergic to that stuff. Yes penicillin can be incredibly deadly for some people which is crazy
35392260	35393300	um
35393300	35398340	I'm pretty sure the guy who discovered penicillin did it by a complete accident as well, which was rather interesting
35398660	35399620	uh
35399620	35401220	There's just complete accident
35401220	35404740	casually discover something that saves literally millions of lives cat
35404820	35410500	Uh, you know, just get a little casual probably in the billions as time goes on easily a billion lives saved because of
35410980	35413940	little accidental petri dish discovery. Um
35415700	35417700	It's really fascinating fascinating
35419060	35424180	Should maybe go into the lore of biology. Uh, no should go into the lore the start of modern modern
35424740	35427540	The wonders of modern medicine. Nah, I'm mercy
35429460	35430900	Not yet
35430900	35436740	How many things can you take at a time? I don't know refland. Should we meet up at convention and find out?
35440740	35442740	I
35444260	35446260	Would you make us a hypnosis
35446340	35448340	To get as hard just by hearing oh
35449380	35455300	Sorry, I didn't mean to say that part out loud. Sorry. Sorry. I'm forgetting to censor. I'm forgetting to censor
35455460	35457460	I've been streaming for a hot second now
35459460	35466820	Sorry, I didn't mean to say that out loud. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm supposed to censor what I say
35470820	35472820	Oh
35474420	35475620	Wow
35475620	35480660	Okay, let me try again gas my nots might not say so Richard. We're on a list. Um
35481780	35487940	What would you make as a hypnosis session to get a the tentacle giving a standing ovation?
35488900	35491940	Uh, just by hearing your voice and have the strongest ink
35493380	35497940	When we hear you think that's an interesting one. I wouldn't mind giving that a tackle
35497940	35499940	Um
35505940	35513540	I'll see so the four part series is one of the first attempts I have ever recorded it is not very good
35513620	35517300	I'll just say that right now. It's not go away chat. It's my wife now
35518660	35523940	Um, I will say that the four free to access audios are my first ever attempt
35524020	35530900	I'm not very satisfied with them looking back on them already even though I only produced them like a month and a bit ago. Um
35532740	35537460	So do give me patience to kind of learn what works what feedback I get. Um
35539300	35541700	I'm very shy, but if you wanted me to
35543300	35548740	Mm-hmm in the middle of a crowded city in broad daylight, I would do it. That's how much I care about
35549060	35553220	You break the law for me. Do you know it's against the law to do that stuff?
35554340	35556340	I wonder when you break the law
35558740	35560740	Mm
35561300	35565780	Mummy I haven't inked in days because I've been spending all my weekend hours watching veiler boy
35567220	35570180	I can't help but support the girls because they make me so happy
35570820	35572020	And I don't
35572020	35576500	To well livestream it. I'm so pent up. I need mummy. Tell me what to do
35577220	35579220	Do you have any of the girls patreon?

35586180	35590740	Uh, I don't think I have a I don't have a full audio yet. That's accessible
35592420	35594420	Wow

35601460	35604340	Who goes yeah, oh did that do it for you? Yeah, you like that
35605140	35608340	I swallowed it all and then and then did a big old burp at the end
35612900	35615940	Day 10 of eating celery. No, we have a set up
35617540	35619540	Did I say that? I think I might have read that one already
35620180	35627300	Stop eating celery for me. It's terrible. It's it's just like better water in a solid form
35627300	35629300	Um
35631140	35633140	Parable
35639540	35642340	The sucky five bucks asking for a friend
35646580	35652740	Stony, I'm really sorry. I tried very hard, but I just couldn't I watched live streams and vods and listened to audios
35652820	35656980	None of our daughters do it for me. I keep coming back to you. Hope you understand. You're my community
35656980	35658980	I'll stop
35659780	35665460	I don't know how you're gonna come in with me. I still support them however I can forever. You're beefling all reefland
35665860	35668900	Thank you for you know, thank you for giving them a shot
35670660	35672180	I would say
35672180	35678900	Sheevy is like incredibly close to me like mentally and personality wise pretty close
35678980	35684340	Unless I'm like completely like misreader, but I'd say she's probably the closest
35685300	35688900	Uh, personality wise and easiest to consume
35694180	35698100	Uh, I would love to share some fanfics, but I don't know if it's appropriate even allowed you can
35698660	35704660	But if it is weird, I submit them. Uh, I think you can do pace bin links. I think those are safe
35706180	35708180	Hi strongy, hi reefland
35709140	35715220	Did you know the term architect and features and comes from the irish actor pierce
35716020	35720980	Ro Brossnan who is rumored to have intentionally made his wife
35721940	35723140	Gain
35723140	35727060	100 pounds over the course of 20 years the term itself is from a quote
35727700	35729860	Made on the architects of peace
35730580	35737300	Home page a world without wills is too terrible to imagine. He did not write a book and call it that
35738900	35744500	Stop is that why he did wait is that from a book he wrote?
35747140	35749780	Oh my god, that's a racist
35750580	35753060	That's outrageous, but really funny
35756580	35758580	Okay
35758580	35763060	I like how ac is sweet and emmy is false to the wall and same
35763780	35767460	I will continue myself right now. Go to sleep
35769220	35771220	Hi strongy your way of
35772260	35777460	Gentle talking is one of my favorite triggers. I think if you did scott's wobble bars, it would be amazing
35780820	35784340	Is there a way to control my who while on stream on youtube?
35785300	35789140	Funny you mentioned that I thought about doing that, but I think it would like to be on banjo
35790260	35792260	and
35793620	35795620	I
35797220	35799220	Have you considered using
35800420	35805220	Bitmosis to plant suggestions that are wholly positive and affirming for the viewer
35805700	35809860	Something to encourage them when they're down to give them that little push when they're low
35810500	35816420	Don't don't want to do the dishes strongy would want you to don't want to cook and just want to order out strongy
35816420	35822820	Would want you to cook strongy would want me to live my best life. That's interesting. I'm wondering
35823620	35827780	If I could do a put in you to sleep asmr
35828580	35831300	but it's secretly hypnosis and then
35832180	35836660	After you've fallen asleep, then I would do like that kind of
35837780	35839780	in
35839780	35841780	In in planting
35842900	35846980	You've got me thinking a little bit when you got me thinking the cogs are turning
35848740	35851140	You got me at help you go to sleep. Yes, I think
35851700	35856740	You could do it if you established triggers outside of youtube and then use some in you
35858740	35865220	I see is way more insane. I thought me was uh having fun
35868500	35875620	I see just yeah, she doesn't like sharing on g fog sans sense or something that uh has been sent somewhere else. She doesn't like that
35876180	35881300	That would be perfect imprinting. Oh my god

35990420	35993540	Cutting it close cutting it close. I think it's possible
35996580	36004020	Science is a wonderful thing like the scientist Fritz Harba who with Carl Bosch invented the harbour Bosch process to synthesize
36004260	36011460	Ammonia since then it has been possible to supply millions of people with food and toxic gas and chemical warfare
36013300	36016580	I'm sure the government would never poison its citizens on purpose

36545780	36552260	Don't do why you click there you go to the bank and then it says withdraw as and then you've got no
36553220	36557060	And then you click on it note all and then I produce a note
36557220	36559300	So you have to do it via the bank to do that
36559540	36563620	But I withdraw as items because I'm currently wanting to interact with the items that I'm pulling out
36564420	36567300	Hey, but that's how you do it and you can sell them all at one time
36569780	36572500	And don't worry that you didn't know because you don't know until you know

36618020	36620020	Oh, it's a wolf clock dumbass
36620900	36622900	What on earth that looks like ink?
36624340	36630020	Wow, oh my god. I'm like get it out of the wazoo like I'm getting so pimped out right now. I'm not being funny
36630020	36635060	I'm literally getting dressed up to go like to valador and like who to myself out honestly
36636020	36641380	Oh, no, it takes off my parrot. Oh, I can't have both. No, I need a rifling on my shoulder

36661460	36665060	Oh, that's raw swordfish
36669460	36673220	Maybe 30 minutes, I'll make a cup of tea because my voice is really starting to
36673940	36678180	What do you mean talking for 10 hours straight means my voice gets tired?
36678500	36681060	What that I've never that's ridiculous
36682500	36684820	That's ridiculous. I've never heard that before
36688580	36690580	Hydration
36691780	36693780	Mmm
36695380	36697380	Wow
36697700	36701940	Yes, I think I might make a cup of tea and the heat should hopefully help my vocal cords
36702980	36707940	But they're starting to feel it mr. Krabs seriously how frustrating
36711460	36717780	I think they say like one of the worst things you can drink is like dairy and fizzy juice when you have like long vocal activity
36718100	36721620	I'm like, oh, yes, the two worst things that I consume constantly
36723140	36726500	I have fizzy juice every day and I have a honey tea every day
36727860	36731780	I finally got my painting desk cleaned off time a pain. Oh my god
36733540	36737780	We should do a Bob Ross stream. Oh the wolf caught me down the floor
36740420	36742020	Okay, boom
36742020	36744020	we're at 1.8 for the
36744580	36745940	a
36746020	36752500	The fishy I guess once all these fishies are done. We'll sell them and then I'm just gonna buy a ton of wine
36753300	36758740	Strongly doesn't like my wolf coat. No, I do like it, but it removes the reef link from my shoulder
36758740	36761700	I know it looks nothing like a reef link, but I want to be parrot
36764820	36767460	I'm just working on cooking on my airman. Oh
36767860	36769860	I'm going
36772740	36776980	Yeah, those are the two literally you're not supposed to have any dairy and I have like milk honey tea
36777860	36781780	And then we compare paintings by the end. Honestly, I'm down for that
36782980	36787860	I saw a tweet where someone had to do vocal warm-ups like a singer. Oh, you're supposed to go like
36789460	36791780	I got carried to that because my friends my
36792900	36794900	I'm out of stamina. I'm out of juice
36795460	36797220	vocally I'm
36797220	36799220	Who goes there? I'm out of stamina
36801060	36803060	I saw yeah
36804980	36810580	Why what an interesting number of marshmallows literally 9-11, okay, dude
36812180	36814660	What did this day? Please hold on your
36816580	36818580	Uh

36822900	36824900	I
36825460	36831700	Read this out loud or is this gonna have everyone saying what wtf? I think we've just gained a far anon
36833860	36837380	Please hold in your fars until it starts to get painful
36837940	36843140	And then blast them onto the make close up so we can hear your cheeks clapping beneath the
36843940	36845620	the basic
36845620	36847620	burst of brass
36847780	36853220	Actually, did she be far in a stream that I don't know if someone told me she be my vaginal
36858820	36861460	I mean I don't judge but I don't think I need you to do that
36862500	36864980	Look, we don't really we don't kink shame around here. Okay
36866020	36868020	She be and emi both did wait
36868820	36870820	Wait, and I've not clipped it
36871060	36875940	Stop, please tell me you guys clipped it so I can turn it into a short for some reason
36876420	36882100	hiccups burps in fart clips of vtubers get so many views
36882180	36884340	I don't even care if it embarrasses them
36884900	36889860	I'm like, I will get you your play button one way or another and I keep farting down that make young lady
36890500	36892500	Yes, Johnny
36893540	36901700	Um for some reason hiccups sneezes any normal bodily function when when vtuber does it hilarious views
36902020	36904020	And I'm like what it doesn't make any sense
36904980	36906980	And
36907940	36911460	Astrony milk in the clips literally though, I wonder why
36914020	36916020	Rappers absolutely
36919620	36926180	The emi one there should be a timestamp in the comments for it. Oh, thank god. Thank you timestampers. You helped me clip my gen mates
36927860	36933220	No, the buraptubers. No, I think we're I think peeler is definitely what we're at
36934660	36939540	Hi, strony. I just want to say I love you and I think you're perfect. Stop everything. You're perfect
36940740	36945940	See, I kissed you. That's how perfect you are. You can't deny the allegation
36947380	36949380	I'm done
36956740	36961380	Okay, oh my tummy's rumbling, but I think it's digested
36964180	36966180	Oh
36966420	36972660	Pea holding stream when are you a pin pal? Are you the one who convinced emi to do that on her stream?
36974580	36977380	It must have been you must have been you pin pal
36977540	36981300	I can I can smell you a male away pin pal
36982340	36986180	Got my stomachs making really weird noises about the 3d or migraine. I even heard all
36988900	36990900	Smell a pin pal
36994260	37000180	I can't believe how well that stream once is it. I've not seen it. Is it bad. Can you get put kidney stones from that?
37001380	37004020	I went to bed get up and you're still cooking these swordfish
37004660	37008420	There was five though. No, there was 10,000 swordfish
37009460	37013620	If I make 10,000 swordfish one stream that means I can do 10,000
37014500	37018580	Wine in one stream most likely if not more it means bod is
37019700	37022340	Back up actually did she cut something out of it?
37022500	37025220	I do not know I've been streaming unfortunately
37027300	37033780	Uh when I stream all day I have no clue what shenanigans the girls are getting up to in all honesty
37034580	37036580	um
37053140	37055140	Oh
37057620	37060020	Wait that video is still getting recommended to people
37061380	37067140	24,000 views 2,000 likes I wonder if because people are liking it
37068580	37071220	Strone has the best boing boing
37072740	37076020	Azura has biggest boing boing or do you mean rump?
37078980	37080980	I have the biggest rump
37082500	37084500	Oh
37085060	37088580	The perfect all the better to smother you basically
37089780	37094180	She's out pealard anything that ever happened the audio after this it takes a day
37094820	37098100	Do you think you'll feel accomplished when you get nighting in cooking? I hope so
37098900	37101540	I'm in the trenches right now on this swordfish
37104900	37108740	She accidentally played the clip on stream she forgot to turn off this the audio
37112580	37114580	Oh
37115140	37119060	You can pass away if you drink too much water she accidentally uploaded it to me
37122500	37124500	Uh, okay, okay, okay
37126660	37128820	She already has a warning on her channel
37130260	37134100	Amy playing with fire, but then again she is the pyromaniac of
37135220	37137860	Vila, so right um right on par
37139140	37141860	Can't believe it can't believe I found such a lore friendly girls
37142420	37144420	smile
37146500	37149700	I have to admit I'm think I'm starting to lag a bit
37150740	37152740	It's not looking good for me
37153220	37155220	slowly perishing
37155220	37161300	I'm like dad make a tea, but I don't think it's gonna wake me up, but I think it's gonna
37164180	37167620	Oh, my stomach's making freaking weird eyes noises. Can you hear that?
37173220	37177700	What will come first heat death of the universe or full inventory no burn honestly
37177940	37184500	I feel like I'm getting so close to it and then I'm getting although the burn percentage is 9.4 it used to be 18.9
37185620	37191620	She cut it out from the vod. We're safe question mark. I'm firmly of the opinion. There's such a thing as
37192980	37194580	Being too big
37194580	37199380	What's 99 after cooking? No, we're just doing cooking
37199540	37204020	We might do some questing together because I'm not familiar with a lot of quests
37204740	37205860	um
37205860	37211860	But that would just be very casual and probably level up combat a little bit before that and
37212580	37215060	once we've achieved 99 cooking and
37216500	37219140	I am not 99ing anything else. I
37220340	37224180	Have severely underestimated how much this is
37225380	37227380	and
37229380	37231780	A strong aspect fill to the caboose
37232980	37237060	If you ever do the cat quest you have to feed it when it's a kitten or it runs away
37238020	37241460	That's so specific. I'm probably never gonna retain this information
37244180	37248740	I'm going to go for a full 99 account for the first time off your brave
37250340	37253780	And the other version of runescape levels go up to 120
37254900	37257140	Did they take even longer to achieve?
37260340	37265940	Oh, that's crazy. Sorry. Oh, I'm having a wee yawn. Sorry
37271140	37273140	Don't mess that update on that video
37274660	37282820	Oh my god, I'm in the money list. I'm sorry. I really don't want to flicks on you guys, but we're in the money
37283300	37285300	Oh
37293540	37300020	Look, uh, whoa fill inventory. No burn get ready to ever said no burn
37303060	37305060	Hold on hold on hold on
37305220	37308020	So this is what it looked like a minute ago
37308980	37313140	So that was the last time I shared it with you 19.8. Okay
37314100	37318660	And the money didn't register, but now the money's registered. Are you ready to get flexed on?
37321540	37323540	Where is it?
37324100	37328820	Are you ready to get flexed on how much money I made on that video? Boom. That's right. Get flexed on
37330740	37335860	To say that gen two has been funded is an understatement. That's how much money I've made
37336580	37338580	What are you gonna do about them?
37341700	37343700	It got limited ads
37343700	37347540	So it probably would have been like 20 bucks if it wasn't limited ads
37348020	37351860	But you know what 10 bucks I'll take you you'll be logged out in 30 minutes
37351860	37354660	Make sure you move to a safe area or log out now
37355620	37357220	Your mama
37357220	37361620	Right. I I'm gonna go make a cup of tea then if it's gonna log me out so I can come back in
37362340	37363540	And
37363540	37368660	Getting 120 is getting 99 about eight times. Oh pass on that. No, thanks
37369220	37374180	How do people make a living off of youtube? Oh, it's much better than this when you have like a
37375140	37380900	A lot of ASMR videos to offer and you make like money generated in the background
37381140	37385540	Right, I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and let this game log me out. Um, I will be back
37385620	37388180	I would just take me about three minutes because you can't leave the world
37391940	37394740	They're in the runescapes. Uh, gay Brooks Johnny
37396580	37397940	Uh
37397940	37399380	Right, I'll be
37399380	37406420	Yeah, three minutes and I'll make a cup of tea. Please do stretch your legs and all that jazz. Um, I will be back
37407300	37412020	In three minutes, which I've said for the eighth time now. Sorry. I'm losing it. Well, I'll be back
37421620	37423620	So
37451620	37453620	So
37481620	37483620	So

37799860	37802180	Which is why I need refilling tea
37803220	37805220	Not just any kind of honey tea
37806180	37813140	Well, I'll get a timer in five minutes. The music was pretty loud. Okay, my apologies. Oh, I've got honey on my freaking finger as well
37814740	37817700	I'm not the good I'm not my refilling honey. I need a special refill
37818340	37820660	The menu music apparently a separate set. Yeah
37822660	37824660	Monkey badness
37827060	37830900	Nice sleepy little reeflings who were already snoozed together honestly

37853860	37854900	No
37854900	37858660	Next week membership streams start because I've already locked in what happens this week
37859460	37861460	Next week is very busy
37862580	37864580	as next week when
37866100	37866980	Uh
37866980	37868740	Elden Ring comes out
37868740	37872260	It's today next week Elden Ring DLC comes out. Okay, so
37873300	37875380	The start of the week is going to be like a
37876340	37880900	multitude of different things going on. It's a little bit crazy sometimes
37881860	37888340	Refilling tea you mean ink tea exactly. That's what my refilling tea is
37889780	37891780	Passed it four times, but I got the tea
37894020	37900580	A bit oh my god, I love those stories where it's like my legs are quaking after a good session. I'm like, oh my god
37901540	37904660	Oh, no, that's not it is I can't feel my legs after
37905460	37909380	How hard I was beating in that session those ones always make me crack up
37910900	37912900	What's good
37915060	37916660	Uh
37916660	37922740	What's good, uh, we're going 10 and a half hour strong. We're wrapping up an hour
37923780	37931140	In less than 30 because of the void restriction. Um, I am going to see if mercy is available
37931940	37933940	to read into or a zero
37934820	37936820	um
37937060	37941700	Oh, my tummy keeps making noises because I need uh, did I end up going for a job?
37942340	37947620	No, it wasn't successful. I had an unsuccessful attempt at adobe, which is why my stomach's making
37948420	37954340	Uh, bizarre noises right now. Oh my god. I'm starting to get like full cooked sword run swordfish ones, which is amazing
37954980	37958260	Do your reeflings want your money back? Am I undet to beeflings?
37958820	37962900	Oh, no, is there any runescape reeflings that I'm indebted to?
37963620	37970900	But I don't have any money. How will I ever repay you runescape reefling for all the things you've done?
37975220	37977620	Get wrecked and connect for apparently
37980020	37983060	Left for a bit and you're still going. Oh, I'm a tough cookie
37983860	37985860	Hard hard to get me to crack
37986340	37990180	When I say, uh, I need to make up for lost time. I wasn't kidding
37991140	37995220	I wasn't kidding. Uh, literally next week we've got like four, maybe even five
37997700	38003060	Well, please don't be getting sick. I really don't want to get sick. Oh, I'm not gonna make it if I get sick
38003780	38006260	I'm not gonna make it. I really don't want to get sick
38010980	38016980	Bless you. Thank you. He's on high. I accept ASMR's payment. Oh, yeah
38016980	38018980	Yeah
38019860	38021860	Per little
38022500	38024500	Needing some tingles
38031060	38034100	One hour of agility treatment is payment because I can't be bothered
38036500	38042660	I need to maybe get the agility shortcut wherever it is on the map. It's like 21 to do the grand exchange shortcut
38047060	38049060	We formally request snitches
38050660	38054020	Thank you for being my sugar daddy on runescape
38056100	38060820	Thank you for making it super easy real me versus strony connect for
38062900	38064900	The real
38066340	38072100	Strony milkers warm and tasty strony milkies, please be hey stay. Oh my god, that's such a good
38072820	38078100	Uh, there's a connect for minigame and runescape. There absolutely is. Do you want to know how I know?
38078100	38084420	There's a connect for minigame and runescape. Uh, I got absolutely annihilated by all the reeflings unanimously at once
38085140	38091620	Uh, the only reason I think I won I won one game by tryharding and I won a second game by mistake
38092020	38094260	Because the other reefling wasn't paying attention
38096580	38101380	And I was literally eating a burrito and I was like what the fuck with my mouth full of a burrito
38102100	38104100	I
38105700	38109060	If you're going to do agility, there's a quest so you can skip a lot of it
38109860	38111860	I think when we do 99
38112420	38119140	Cookin will probably take a solid break from any runescape streams for a bit because there are a few other like multiplayer games
38119140	38122340	I want to like focus on like elden rings like the next big
38123140	38125140	Like a thing we're taking on
38125700	38127700	and
38128260	38130260	I don't know if you can hear my stomach
38132260	38135300	No, you can't the mic's not covered. It's covering it up
38136660	38142100	Just Johnny's milk tastes like jelly. I even know what cuttlefish milk would taste like
38144100	38147380	Would it be gelatinous or would it be silky like ink?
38149460	38151460	I think it may be silky
38153300	38155300	Worthing
38155300	38157220	Love these 20 things
38157220	38159220	Thank you for the smoothies
38159220	38161220	Also need to be on a members world for uh
38162340	38167780	I'm blamed when it comes to board games. I lost fair and square though. Okay. Okay. Okay
38169860	38175620	Well, actually who's got the higher IQ reeflings are strong in clearly the reef one clearly
38183540	38184580	Wow
38184580	38188740	We're at 1.4 on the swordfish. We may be able to finish it
38189220	38190340	Or
38190340	38193860	We might just be out of time, but honestly, it's not the biggest deal. However
38194900	38198260	You need to give strongy the monkey nut items. That's so specific
38199540	38201540	and
38201700	38206260	And could we solely if it's anything like squid ink you've eaten squid ink before
38208420	38214740	You've eaten your fellow reeflings before oh, we're in 1.6 k territory at 1,600
38215380	38219540	Monkey nuts 287. I blame all my eyes. I
38223220	38226020	I'm on you you eating your fellow reeflings. What's going on here?
38226020	38228020	Oh
38242340	38243620	See to be honest
38243620	38246740	You were just randomly placing the pieces, but I wasn't low
38246900	38251380	I was trying to counteract what the reefling was doing. That's the worst part
38251540	38256340	I was actually trying to win and I could never see what the reefling was making
38256660	38263060	I was too busy trying to like get ahead and make something for me that I couldn't see what the reefling was doing
38266580	38274500	Is worse than emmy rip of my jeans what I listen to emmy stream and if I recall correctly my glass prescription is worse than emmy
38275060	38279700	Oh, emmy cannot see. Oh my goodness bless her cotton socks. She can't see for
38282340	38285780	I reeflings gotta do what he got a scuba doo ba doo
38288020	38293460	Yeah, you literally saw what I was doing and then you forgot no because I was trying to like
38294180	38297780	I was trying to be like all the reeflings doing this the reeflings doing that right
38297780	38300660	So I'm not gonna place one here and then I'd immediately forget
38304020	38306020	Mods cruises jays
38307460	38309460	You really want me to believe that yeah
38310420	38312420	I was like trying to think ahead
38320020	38324580	I believe I can't believe I made it 10 us dollars. It feels good man
38331540	38333540	Wow
38334100	38336340	Okay, these swordfish are giving me like
38336580	38337860	What
38337860	38340820	7k a batch that's not bad
38342340	38346260	Honestly not bad. I know wine is more which is fine
38346900	38352020	But I think that's like 7k xp of inventory if I don't burn them all. Okay. Okay
38353620	38355620	Well spoke too soon on that one
38359060	38360900	Congrats on level up
38360980	38366900	It's time to beat on up on connect for strategy. It's like I'm beat strong the next time
38374500	38379940	What's my burn percentage? Oh, it's like oh, I guess it's not up to accuracy because I logged out
38381060	38384260	I got logged out against me will yeah, um
38385220	38391700	Right tomorrow's crash bandicoot, which is eight hours. So it's just a long stream in quotation marks
38392820	38394820	Not an endurance
38395060	38400260	Short stream is two hours. Um, which is buckshot roulette, but that's because I've got the doctor
38403300	38407460	And I'll keep you guys up to date on what on earth is happening with me toe
38407540	38411540	But it's pretty much decided if you guys want to hold a funeral during buckshot roulette
38412020	38414980	You're more than welcome to pour one out for the toe
38416100	38418100	It's been a good run, but
38418420	38421380	I'm just no fussed for it. Does they make a difference to me?
38422420	38424420	To me
38424980	38426980	To me
38428820	38430580	Riptoe
38430580	38437140	It's a great lineup. Yeah, I do. Um, I want or probably can't do it tonight because I'm going to be shattered
38437540	38442660	I need to go put emmy and aces memberships live literally as soon as I end this stream
38444100	38446100	So I need to
38446500	38448500	What I need to do
38450260	38452260	I need to
38453380	38455380	Do that
38455860	38460580	I wanted to look up baltro more because that actually looks like a genuinely fun game
38461140	38464020	I just need to comprehend what on earth i'm doing first
38464580	38469940	I don't know. Maybe I need to play it offline like off stream for a little bit just to get the hang of it
38471220	38474340	Or is it better if streamer plays it for the first time?
38475380	38478100	Like I don't think watching other people play it is cheating
38479700	38483940	Rip the big gripper you will be missed literally both of them. No, no, just the one
38485460	38487780	Shawnee caught the da budus. Oh, no
38488420	38490420	People don't think I've got da budus
38491380	38498580	Um, oh my god a streamer tries american sweet loses toenails loses toenail within
38499460	38501220	one week
38501220	38503220	Diabetes hits hard on streamer
38507060	38511060	How many features do you see how many where we get no burns one?
38512580	38514580	Honestly
38514820	38519620	How many multiplayer games are on your to-do list multiplayer games are every week
38520820	38525380	um next multiplayer game is elden ring for a while and then
38527140	38529140	Probably jellybean
38530580	38537460	I love my jellybean. I don't know if they've added more stuff to it. Um, we never gave dead by daylight ago
38537540	38539540	I don't know how that would work
38540340	38546260	I think I would have to add you guys as friends possibly on steam and then delete everyone at the end
38546580	38552500	I don't know. I wanted to give fortnite a shot, but folk were rolling their eyes at fortnite
38552500	38554980	But i'm like fortnite's actually know that bad
38555780	38559940	As far as i'm aware they've like added in different game modes and stuff
38561060	38563060	um
38565220	38569620	I want uh, I would say mario kart but I suck at mario kart and it and
38570740	38574180	Like I don't I don't know how to do that new turn feature thing in it
38574260	38576340	Like we have to like turn left and right well
38578500	38581000	Called it momay win the jellybean game
38584180	38586920	It's a meme to hate fortnite at this point
38598100	38599780	It's just
38599780	38602340	Ever listened to rap city you want to sing it
38603300	38605780	Is this the real life?
38607140	38609700	Or is this just fantasy?
38611540	38613540	Caught in a landslide
38615380	38618580	No escape from reality
38621460	38625300	Look in your eyes, I don't know the words and see
38628100	38630100	uh

38663940	38665860	um
38665860	38667860	I was thinking about the in-game song oops

38670900	38672900	What is, where does that go?
38673860	38677060	Easy come easy go little high little woe
38679060	38682980	Anyway the wind blows it doesn't matter to me
38683220	38685220	Hmm
38685540	38689620	I'm just a poor boy from a poor family. He's just a poor boy
38690660	38693060	Spare him his life from this monstrosity

38767780	38769780	I
38776900	38779940	I'm just a perv. We fun. I need no sympathy
38785300	38787300	That wasn't I'm just a fool
38789060	38791060	Because I have a mummy I'm
38791140	38794740	Mummies losing the plot. That's what mummy's doing right now. I'm starting to
38795460	38799140	Uh, yeah, but h2o delirious often here
38800580	38805460	The bird outside my window the magpies are probably wondering why I have upset them today
38806580	38808580	and
38809860	38811860	I can do it. I promise
38812740	38817060	I can do it. I can stay up reefing. I'm totally not exhausted, but it's okay
38820740	38822740	I can make it happen
38822820	38824820	I can make it happen
38830100	38832100	Yay
38832180	38837060	I didn't get any serotonin, but I think it's because I'm so tired. There's no serotonin left in my system
38837540	38839860	You don't have anything to burn on the fire. I do so

38846900	38848900	Well, now I gotta adapt the learn
38849700	38854820	Yeah, eventually serotonin only comes from night in it man. This game was rigged from the start
38856020	38858020	Reach for the stars
38860020	38865220	Yippee 78. Well, I definitely blew over my guesstimate for what we would be on
38866420	38870100	But uh, I'm still back at level 62
38871540	38877140	That's fine. Maybe wane cost a lot of money though. That's the only problem
38879780	38881780	Oh
38883300	38887780	Are we friends? I can do it. I can do it. You kid
38889540	38892900	I could also cook and not waste xp. She's passing out. Oh, yeah

39423060	39425060	I had to be this way
39428020	39432900	Didn't I see this stream this morning 10 hours. Yeah. Yeah, you did. I'm a wee bit addicted
39433380	39435380	I'm starting to lose the plot though. So
39436420	39439140	You're welcome to watch my descent into madness
39439620	39444180	My filter is also gone because I've started to see things. I know I'm not supposed to see
39444740	39447300	But they're kind of just coming out just like you're angry, you know
39449540	39453380	Only so much I can do we're actually gonna get less than a thousand sorties
39454980	39459300	Listen, I mean that internal part. No, they are internal parts. Well, at least I'm a digest
39461700	39463700	But this must mean I'm disgusting
39463700	39465700	I
39466580	39470100	To make myself wealthy she's slowly dying from my
39474660	39476260	Oh
39476260	39482020	I came in at work quite tired and feisty wrote an entire world domination agenda on my calendar
39482900	39485940	Are we doing it? Are we taking down the big companies?
39487540	39490580	11 hour grinds that interests of thoughts are taking the wheel
39491300	39493300	Take the wheel
39496420	39497460	Man really?
39497460	39501620	Okay. Oh, I had to complete the start for that. Man runescape is really
39502340	39507540	Oh gee. Yes old-school runescape runescape 3 which is the new one. I think
39508580	39512500	Not really played that at all. I didn't actually understand
39513700	39515940	When it came out there was two different games
39516340	39520340	And I think I actually ended up playing runescape 3 for a little bit like a dummy
39520820	39524020	Because I was like, why is the game so different? Why did they do that?
39524420	39526020	and then
39526020	39531300	Or was it they made runescape 3 and then everyone was like oh go back and then they're like, okay
39531540	39533540	There's no two games
39535140	39540020	These are the golden hours. So this is the last batch. Uh, not quite. We've still got
39543460	39546900	50 minutes, I could have sworn it said 50 minutes 50 minutes ago, but
39547860	39553220	There's three. I thought there was like runescape 3 wasn't the new runescape called runescape 3
39554420	39556420	It's really ojisa
39557540	39559540	Get it because that's how I say ojii
39561140	39565300	Runescape 3 is the original server from that. It's mostly runescape is them
39565780	39568980	We've written the old game back. Oh, okay
39570260	39576420	Because they didn't world of warcraft do that as well. There's like an old world warcraft. Oh my god
39577620	39581220	My tongue is not even following what I'm telling it to do
39582260	39584260	Wow
